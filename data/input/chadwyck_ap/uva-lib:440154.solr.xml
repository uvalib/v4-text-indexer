      <field name="fulltext">POEMS AND VERSES. TO W. F. C. ENFOLDINGS. The snowflake that softly, all night, is whitening treetop and pathway; The avalanche suddenly rushing with darkness and death to the hamlet. The ray stealing in through the lattice, to waken the day-loving baby; The pitiless horror of light in the sun-smitten reach of the desert. The seed with its wondrous surprise of welcome young leaflet and blossom; The despair of the wilderness tangle, and grim, taunting forest unending. The happy west wind as it startles some noon-laden flower from its dreaming; The hurricane crashing its way through the homes and the life of the valley. The play of the jetlets of flame where the children laugh out on the hearthstone; The town and the prairie enswirled in the glare of the red devastation. The glide of a wave on the sands with its myriad sparkle in breaking; The roar and the fury of ocean, a limitless maelstrom of ruin. The leaping of heart unto heart with bliss that can never be spoken; The passion that maddens, and blights the God-given love that enshrines us. For this do I tremble and start when the rose on the vine taps my shoulder; For this when the storm beats me down, my soul groweth bolder and bolder. INVERTED. Youth has its griefs, its disappointments keen, Its baffled longings and its memories; Its anguish in a joy that once hath been; Its languid settling in a sinful ease. And age has pleasures, rosy, fresh and warm, And glad beguilements and expectancies; Its heart of boldness for a threatened storm; Its eager launching upon sunny seas. Youth has its losses, sad and desolate; Its wreck of precious freight where all was sent; Its blight of trust, its helpless heart of fate, Its dreary knowledge of illusion spent. For life is but a day; and, dawn or eve, The shadows must be long when suns are low. Old age may be surprised and loth to leave; And youth may weary wait and long to go. THE STARS. They wait all day unseen by us, unfelt; Patient they bide behind the noon's full glare; And we who watched the dawn when they were there, Thought we had seen them in the daylight melt, While the slow sun upon the earth-line knelt. Because the teeming sky seemed void and bare, When we explored it through the dazzled air, We had no thought that there all day they dwelt. Yet were they over us, alive and true, In the vast shades far up above the blue,â The brooding shades beyond our daylight kenâ Serene and patient till, with conscious light, They shine, resplendent, for our joy again,â The eternal jewels of the short-lived night! THE TWO MYSTERIES. âIn the middle of the room, near the coffin, sat Walt Whitman, holding a beautiful little girl on his lap. She looked wonderingly at the spectacle of death, and then inquiringly into the face of the aged poet. âYou don't know what it is, do you, my dear?â said he, and added, âWe don't, either.ââ We know not what it is, dear, this sleep so deep and still; The folded hands, the awful calm, the cheek so pale and chill; The lids that will not lift again, though we may call and call; The strange, white solitude of peace that settles over all. We know not what it means, dear, this desolate heart-pain; This dread to take our daily way, and walk in it again; We know not to what other sphere the loved who leave us go, Nor why we 're left to wonder still, nor why we do not know. But this we know: Our loved and dead, if they should come this dayâ Should come and ask us âWhat is life?â not one of us could say. Life is a mystery as deep as ever death can be; Yet oh, how dear it is to us, this life we live and see! Then might they sayâthese vanished onesâand blessÃ¨d is the thought: âSo death is sweet to us, beloved! though we may show you naught; We may not to the quick reveal the mystery of deathâ Ye cannot tell us, if ye would, the mystery of breath.â The child who enters life comes not with knowledge or intent, So all who enter death must go as little children sent. Nothing is known. But, nearing God, what hath the soul to dread? And as life is to the living, so death is to the dead. SHADOW-EVIDENCE. I. Swift o'er the sunny grass, I saw a shadow pass With subtle charm; So quick, so full of life, With thrilling joy so rife, I started lest, unknown, My stepâere it was flownâ Had done it harm. II. Why look up to the blue? The bird was gone, I knew, Far out of sight. Steady and keen of wing, The slight, impassioned thing, Intent on a goal unknown, Had held its course alone In silent flight. III. Dear little bird, and fleet. Flinging down at my feet Shadow for song: More sure am I of theeâ Unseen, unheard by meâ Than of some things felt and known, And guarded as my own, All my life long. BY THE LAKE. I listen to the plashing of the lake,â The tideless tide that silvers all its edge, And stirs, yet rouses not, the sleepy sedge,â While the glad, busy sky is wide awake, And pools along the shore its fleeting shadows take. I listen to the plashing, clear and faint; Now sharp against the stones that slide it back, Now soft and nestling in a mossy track, Or rocking in an eager, homeless plaint, Or stifled in the ooze, whose yielding is restraint. Nature's deep lessons come in silences, Or sounds that fall like silence on our sense; And so this plashing seeks my soul's pretense, And bids it say what its fulfillment is, And bares to searching light its fond alliances. I cannot fathom all my soul doth hide, Nor sound the centres that the waves conceal; Yet in a dim, half-yearning way I feel The urging of the low, insistent tide,â Till the plashing seems like sobbing, and the sky grows cold and wide. HEART-ORACLES. By the motes do we know where the sunbeam is slanting; Through the hindering stones speaks the soul of the brook; Past the rustle of leaves we press in to the stillness; Through darkness and void to the Pleiads we look; The silence of dawn with the night-shadows o'er us, Begins all the morning's munificent chorus. Through sorrow come glimpses of infinite gladness; Through grand discontent mounts the spirit of youth; Loneliness foldeth a wonderful loving; The breakers of Doubt lead the great tide of Truth; And dread and grief-haunted the shadowy portal That shuts from our vision the splendor immortal. THERE'S A WEDDING IN THE ORCHARD. There's a wedding in the orchard, I know it by the flowers; They 're wreathed on every bough and branch, Or falling down in showers. The air is in a mist, I think, And scarce knows which to beâ Whether all fragrance, clinging close, Or bird-song, wild and free. And countless wedding-jewels shine, And golden gifts of grace; I never saw such wealth of sun In any shady place. It seemed I heard the fluttering robes Of maidens clad in white, The clasping of a thousand hands In tenderest delight; While whispers ran among the boughs Of promises and praise; And playful, loving messages Sped through the leaf-lit ways. Then were there swayings to and fro; The weeds a-tiptoe rose; And sang the breeze a sudden song That sank to sudden close; And just beyond the wreathÃ¨d aisles That end against the blue, The raiment of the silent choir And priest came shining through. And though I saw no wedding-guest, Nor groom, nor gentle bride, I know that holy things were said, And holy love replied. Soon will the lengthening shadows move Unwillingly away, Like friends who linger with adieux Yet are not bid to stay. I follow with the vesper bird, And hear its soft âgood-night,â Still thinking of the wedding-scene And aisles of flowery light. TRUST. Though tangled hard life's knot may be, And wearily we rue it, The silent touch of Father Time Some day will sure undo it. Then hope and wait; Nothing is late In the light that shines forever. We faint at heart, a friend is gone; We chafe at the world's harsh drilling; We tremble at sorrows on every side, At the myriad ways of killing. Yet, say we all, If a sparrow fall, The Lord keepeth count forever. He keepeth count. We come, we go, We speculate, toil and falter: But the measure to each of weal or woe, God only can give or alter. He sendeth light, He sendeth night, And change goes on forever. Why not take life with cheerful trust, With faith in the strength of weakness? The slenderest daisy rears its head With courage, yet with meekness. A sunny face Hath holy grace, To woo the sun forever. Forever and ever God's law prevails, Goodness and love are undying; Only the troubles and cares of earth Are winged from the first for flying. Our way we plow In the furrow ânowâ; But after the tilling and growing, the sheaf; Soil for the root, but the sun for the leaf,â And God keepeth watch forever. THE HUMAN TIE. âAs if life were not sacred, too.ââ George Eliot. Speak tenderly! For he is dead,â we say; âWith gracious hand smooth all his roughened past, And fullest measure of reward forecast, Forgetting naught that gloried his brief day.â Yet of the brother, who, along our way, Prone with his burdens, heart-worn in the strife, Totters before usâhow we search his life, Censure, and sternly punish, while we may. Oh, weary are the paths of Earth, and hard! And living hearts alone are ours to guard. At least, begrudge not to the sore distraught The reverent silence of our pitying thought. Life, too, is sacred; and he best forgives Who says: âHe errs, butâtenderly! He lives.â FROM FLOWER TO LIGHT. In sorrow I tended my garden, As the colors, day by day, Faded and changed in the heedless air, And passed with the summer away. While they gladdened my beautiful garden, Where the dews and the sunlight abide, And crept up the wall to my window, Or hid, as the sweetest will hide; While they lavished their splendor before me, Not a flower had I heart to cullâ Till the heaven-lit flames of the latest Went out, and my garden was dull. O cruel the death of the blossoms, And cruel the words that were said: âNext Spring shall the earth be re-gladdened, The living shall bloom from the dead.â Not for me would the blooming be, ever, For my love, O my love! could not stay. Hand in hand we had bent o'er their brightness, And now he was passing away. The heart-breaking flowers of next summer, They will look at me, dreary and wan, Or mock me, and taunt me, and maddenâ O God, that the years should roll on! So I felt; and I would not look skyward, Nor earthward, but only at himâ At him with his clear dying vision, Who saw not the earth growing dim. At him, till alone in the garden I stood with the husks of the flowers; Alone, and the pitiless Autumn Sent dead leaves about me, in showers. âLook up!â he had whispered in parting; âLook up!â said a voice to me then,â And lo! the lost hues of my garden Above me were glowing again! Near by, in the wide-spreading maples; Far-off, in the mist of the wood; Around and above me they gathered, And lit all the place where I stood. My purples, my rose-tints and yellows, My crimsons that gladdened his sight, My glorious hues of the garden Were living in sunnier height! Were living! were living! I knew it! And the comfort that came to me so, Endured when the forest was naked And the grass covered over with snow. For again I looked up and beheld them, The souls of the flowers he had blest; I saw them in glory transfigured Far off in the wonderful West. Contented, at last, I beheld themâ My colors immortal and brightâ Till the gates of the sunset, slow-folding, Shut them out from my passionate sight. OVER THE WORLD. There is a time between our night and day, A space between this world and the unknown, Where none may enter as we stand alone Save the one other single soul that may; Then is all perfect if the two but stay. It is the time when, the home-evening flown, And âgood-nightsâ sped in happy household tone, We look out from the casement ere we pray. Into the world of darkness deep and far We gazeâeach depth with its own deepest star, That brightens as we turn, nor yet recedes When we would search it with our sorest needs,â O holy living-ground from heaven won! O time beyond the night when day is done! EMERSON. We took it to the woods, we two, The book well worn and brown, To read his words where stirring leaves Rained their soft shadows down. Yet as we sat and breathed the scene, We opened not a page; Enough that he was with us there, Our silent, friendly sage! His fresh âRhodoraâ bloomed again; His âHumble-beeâ buzzed near; And oh, the âWood-notesâ beautiful He taught our souls to hear! So our unopened book was read; And so, in restful mood, We and our poet, well content, Went sauntering through the wood. ONCE BEFORE. Once before, this self-same air Passed me, though I know not where. Strange! how very like it came! Touch and fragrance were the same, Sound of mingled voices, too, With a light laugh ringing through; Some one movingâhere or thereâ Some one passing up the stair, Some one calling from without, Or a far-off childish shout; Simple, home-like, nothing more,â Yet it all hath been before! Not to-day, nor yesterday, Nor any day. But far awayâ So long ago, so very far, It might have been on other star. How was it spent? and where? and when? This life that went, yet comes again? Was sleep its world, or death its shore? I still the silent Past implore. Ah! never dream had power to show Such vexing glimpse of Long Ago. Never a death could follow death With love between, and home, and breath. The spell has passed. What spendthrifts we, Of simple, household certainty! What golden grain we trample low Searching for flowers that never grow! For home is real, and love is real; Nor false our honest high ideal. Life, it is bounding, warm and strong, And all my heart resounds with song. It must be true, whate'er befall, This, and the world to come are all. And yet it puzzles meâalack! When life that could not be, comes back! WHIP-POOR-WILL. The Western sky blazed through the trees, And in the East the dove-light shone; Low fields of clover to the breeze Gave out a fragrant monotone; While sharp-voiced, whirring things beyond Sent a faint treble through the air, And discords of the hidden pond Pulsed like an anthem, deep and rare. Yet all the twilight range seemed still, The tumult was so subtle-sweet; When forth it burst,âclear, slow, complete, The evening call of âWhip-poor-will!â The yarrow, crowding by the hedge, Stirred not its specked, uncertain white; The locust on the upland's edge Stood tranced against the blaze of light; For now the throbbing air was mute, Since that wild note had pierced it through,â That call so clear, so resolute, So tender, dominant and true. When suddenly, across the hill,â Long, low and sweet, with dreamy fall, Yet true and mellow, call for call, Elate, and with a human thrill,â Came the far answer: âWhip-poor-will!â LONG AGO. Still the rock is in the forest, With the branches overhead, And the linden-tree, low-bending By the sumac, flaming red. In and out among the shadows Glides the self-same woodland stream; Still the bright-eyed squirrels listen, And the beetles idly dream. Do the squirrels hear a foot-fall, Or the beetles flash their green For a hand that parts the branches, Letting sun-light in between? Does the brook, with rippling lightness, Catch two shadowsâhis and mineâ Give them to its circling eddies With a murmuring divine? Do the lichens, gray and clinging, Hear a promise whispered there, While the ferns look up and listen, Laughing through the maiden-hair? Do the birds that fill the distance, Or the glints of summer blue, Try to sing and shine love's gladness As of old they used to do? Ah, for comfort of all rovers, Such as I, in stranger clime; Sure as sunlight, new-made lovers Roam to-day the summer's prime. Heaven spare the fields their brightness! Spare the brook its sparkling flow! Light the woods with holy shadows As it lit them long ago! THE CHILD AND THE SEA. One Summer day, when birds flew high, I saw a child step into the sea; It glowed, and sparkled at her touch, And softly plashed about her knee. It held her lightly with its strength, It kissed and kissed her silken hair; It swayed with tenderness to know A little child was in its care. She, gleeful, dipped her pretty arms, And caught the sparkles in her hands; I heard her laughter, as she soon Came skipping up the sunny sands. âIs this the cruel sea?â I thought, âThe merciless, the awful sea?ââ Now hear the answer soft and true, That rippled over the beach to me: âShall not the sea, in the sun, be glad When a child doth come to play? Had it been in the storm-time, what could I, The sea, but bear her awayâ Bear her away on my foaming crest, Toss her and hurry her to her rest? âBe it life or death, God ruleth me; And He loveth every soul; I've an earthly shore and a heavenly shore, And toward them both I roll; Shining and beautiful, both, are they,â And a little child will go God's way.â THE COMPACT. It was a little boy who lived in Philadelphia town, And a very kind old gentleman, whose name was Mr. Brown. It happened that the self-same day they visited the Fair, And, hand in hand, they walked about, a happy, friendly pair. The little boy looked right and left with eager, wondering eyes, The other gazed more steadily, for he was old and wise; But soon he caught the small boy's way of feeling glad and bright; And the boy no longer aimlessly looked to the left and right. âI like you, Mr. Brown,â he said. âYou make me understand.â âI like you, too,â thought Mr. Brown, and pressed the little hand. And so they walked together, and saw the mighty show, While music, light, and brilliant hues set all the crowd aglow. Then, suddenly, a shadow fell upon the old man's face; He fixed his eyes right wistfully upon the wondrous place. âAh, me! ah, me!â he muttered, as to himself, nor smiled At the merry look of questioning that came upon the child. âMy boy, a hundred years from now, another mighty Fair Will crown the new Centennial; but we shall not be there. Not one of all this eager crowdâ (and here he drew a sigh) âWill be living on the earth that dayânot even you and I. âThe years will bring discoveries, inventions, manners new, And nations yet unborn may shame the things that here we view. I own I 'd like to see it all, the next Centennial Fair, With the Stars and Stripes that day, as now, flung gayly to the air. âI 'd like to see the world grown wiser, better, too, my lad (Though I'm not one of those who think this world is wholly bad). I 'd like to see the country shine with nobler, holier grace, And the Church of Christ triumphant in the manners of a race. âIt 's useless to regret, I know; our life is but a span. We'll all be gone before that day; yes, all, my little man.â Then Brown, he wiped his spectacles, and gave a quiet cough; But the little boy said: âNever mind, it 's such a long way off.â âYes, long for you, perhaps, my boy; but my life 's nearly spent. Yet, if I knew just how the world would grow, I 'd be content.â The little boy stopped short, with: âHere are benches, let 's sit down. I'll tell you what I'll do for you, with pleasure, Mr. Brown. âWhen I get big, I'll notice sharp just what the people do, And how they live, how good they areâI'll watch them just for you. And then I'll tell some little boy (not born yet) he must keep A sharp lookout, and, don't you see? in time he'll learn a heap. âWell, when I'm old, I'll say to him what you have said to-day: âMy boy, my time is nearly spent; I'll soon be going away; I can't see the Centennial that 's coming soon, I know; But you will see it, certainly, before you have to go. ââNow, I'm going,â I'll say, âto Heaven; and when you come there, too, You can tell me all about the show, and what you saw there new, And how the people looked and did in Philadelphia town, For I want to tell a friend of mine up there, named Mr. Brown.ââ He ceased. The old man stared, then smiled and stroked the sunny head. âThank you, my boy, I'll count on you.â And that was all they said. Then, quite content and glad again, the mighty show they scanned,â The old man and the little boy,âstill walking hand in hand. DEATH IN LIFE. She sitteth there a mourner, With her dead before her eyes; Flushed with the hues of life is he And quick are his replies. Often his warm hand touches hers; Brightly his glances fall; And yet, in this wide world, is she The loneliest of all. Some mourners feel their dead return In dreams, or thoughts at even; Ah, well for them their best-beloved Are faithful still in heaven! But woe to her whose best-beloved, Though dead, still lingers near; So far away when by her side, He cannot see nor hear. With heart intent, he comes, he goes In busy ways of life. His gains and chances fill his thoughts; His hours with joy are rife. Careless he greets her day by day, Nor thinks of words once said.â Oh, would that love could live again, Or her heart give up its dead! BY MOONLIGHT. Out of the depths above shone forth The beautiful, radiant orb of light; Paling the stars near by, she rose, Queen of the spheres and the limitless night. Four of us glided along in the boat,â Rhoda and Etta, Harry and I,â Cheerily watching the glory that streamed Across the sea from the bending sky. Etta spoke first, and her voice seemed far: âThe sparkling line, however we turn, Comes straight to me!â But I claimed it, too, I at the bow, and she at the stern. We laughed, insisting; then Rhoda, between:â âAbsurd! for it comes to me, not youâ A beautiful, silvery ribbon of light, Crinkling and shining across the blue.â Then Harry, the rower: âBy all that 's bright It flashes its course direct to me!â Thus merry, intent and apart we sat, Claiming the splendor that crossed the sea Till Rhoda, the fairy, proposed a plan (A friskier sailor was never afloat); And then, with many a laugh and start, We all changed seats in the rocking boat. O human vision, how blind it is! 'T was plain, at last, that our partial sight Had made the glory that shone for all To each seem a narrow pathway bright. Shining, arose on the breast of the sea, A lesson in love, a thought of grace: Learn thou to look for the Heavenly light Not alone from thine own, but thy neighbor's place. Four of us glided home in the boat, Rhoda and Etta, Harry and I, Thoughtfully watching the glory that streamed Over the sea from the silent sky. THE MASTER HAND. Life is a picture, warm and grand, Of varied colors made; Each touch is by the Master's hand, And His the light and shade. These tints so strong and fresh and brightâ Ah, here the foreground glows! Some souls are brave and gladly right, And God, the Master, knows. What though He wills my lines must be Obscure and gray and drear? His picture was in need of me, And He hath set me here. My shadow may bring out, intent, The brightness of a soul That must be free and prominent To make the perfect whole. Or, it may be, a sadder lot, A colder dash of gray, Falls somewhere near, and mine is not The very darkest way. We cannot change us by a tint, Nor guide our lines alone; But we may catch His subtlest hint, And hold it as our own. To learn and heed the Master's will, And rightly do our part, To bow before Almighty skill, And reverence His artâ Content and blest one touch to beâ This is enough, O Soul! When God, for all Eternity, His picture shall unroll. ELBERON. (1881.) I. JULY. We watched the little children by the sea Tempting the wave with mimic forts of sand; Hillock and pit they modeled in their glee, Laughing to see them leveled on the strand. Deep was the music of the breakers' roar, And bright the spray they tossed upon the shore; Fresh gales of joy blew landward, but in vain: The Nation's heart was heavy with its pain. II. AUGUST. The little children skipping by the sea, Bare-limbed and merry, challenge its advance; Holding the sunlight in their hair, they flee The prone wave's tumult while they shout and dance: But he who suffers far away grows faint With longing for the seaside cheer and plaint;â Ah, bright the tide, and blue the bending sky, While stately ships, intent, go sailing by! III. SEPTEMBER. What power was this? No tumult on the deep! The conscious waves crept whispering to the sand; The very children, awed and eager, keep The spell of silence holding sea and land. White wings of healing filled the summer sky, And prayerful thousands stood expectant by, While, borne on bed of hope, content and wan, The Nation's Man came into Elberon. â'T is well!â the news sped gladly, day by day,â âOld Ocean sends its strengthening breeze apace!â Grandly, above the sparkling wavelets' play, Our country's banner floated in its graceâ When, suddenly, grim shadows gathered near To overwhelm us with a nameless fear; Till all along Atlantic's sobbing sandsâ Far as it rims our own and other lands, Across the world, what spot the sun shines onâ Sounded the tidings dread: The President is dead! A Nation's grief broods over Elberon. BLOOM. The sudden sun shone through the pane And lighted both their facesâ A prettier sight just after rain Ne'er fell in pleasant places: Two girls. One held a graceful glass, And one a bulb unsightly, Ragged and soiled. And this the lass Upon the vase laid lightly. âWhat lovely flowers we'll have,â said they, âAfter it starts a-growing!â The sun, delighted, slipped away And down the west went glowing. SNOW-FLAKES. Whenever a snow-flake leaves the sky, It turns and turns to say âGood-bye! Good-bye, dear cloud, so cool and gray!â Then lightly travels on its way. And when a snow-flake finds a tree, âGood-day!â it saysââGood-day to thee! Thou art so bare and lonely, dear, I'll rest, and call my comrades here.â But when a snow-flake, brave and meek, Lights on a rosy maiden's cheek, It startsââHow warm and soft the day! 'T is summer!ââand it melts away. THE TROUBLED MAID. A village maiden lightly trod Her lonely way to the house of God. And there the words that met her ear Were bitter words for a maid to hear. For they said the world was bad to the core, And the heart of the maiden grew faint and sore. As homeward then she went her way, Her path through a lovely woodland lay; And stooping to pluck a rose, she caught Only the thorns. Alas! she thought, Dear Lord in heaven, must this be so? Do thorns forever with roses grow? In all this beautiful world and dear Must sin and woe lurk hidden near? Then, tenderly pressing the flower to her face, Breathing its sweetness and holy with grace, She said as she bent her fair head down: âWith roses and thorns we must weave our crown; God is our Father, and he is good.â And her way grew bright through the lonely wood. FAITH. The wind drove the moon To a sky-built cave, And closed it up As it were her grave. The cave threw wide A silver portalâ And forth she came, Serene, immortal! He piled black clouds In angry might, Till lost in gloom Was all her light. The clouds a moment Held her under; Then, glorified, They burst asunder! The wind, that night, Bemoaned and whistled Till all the forest Stirred and bristled; While moonbeams stole To tear-wet pillows, And found their way Through grave-yard willows. THE EASTER MORN. Between rude March and the bright May weatherâ The bluster and dearth and the willow's green featherâ Tipped with jewels and warm with Spring, Raindrop, and blossom, and song a-wing, Full of promise and tender cheer, Glowing aloft and lighting a-near Day when a deathless hope was bornâ Dawneth the radiant Easter morn! After the watching, and fasting, and sadness, Cometh peace and the answering gladness, Whispering unto the weary soul: âPast be all conflict, doubting, and dole.â Ah, for the joy that hath promise to live! Ah, for the yearning to help and forgive! This is the Easter we long for and choose! This is the Easter we turn from and lose! âTHOUGHTS ARE THINGS.â If times be hard and dollars few When Christmas-tide draws near, And hearty kindlinessâah, me!â Knows it must empty-handed be, Still are there needs that wait for you: Some cloud to rift with sunny blue, Some life that halts with hindering fear, Lacking the simple gift of cheer. Thoughts are our riches, bounteous, free; We need not empty-handed be! Obey the oracle divine That makes our inmost self its shrine. Harken: âGive vexing care swift wings, And to your soul hold near Only the thought that softly sings, That brings you hope, and light, and cheer; For thoughts are things. Know that mere gifts of compliment Wax poor ere Christmas lights are spent. Remember,âand no longer sigh,â The rarest gifts that gold can buy Have little worth, however fair, If strain of purse or anxious care Hath robbed them of their true intent.â From friend to friend, the choicest gift That ever love can give Is that which comes the heart to lift Or help the soul to live. Of all fair bounties ever bought, Of gems or jewels rare, What treasure like a loving thought, Or love's far-reaching prayer! Courage, and trust, and peace of mind, Faith in the good in humankind, Theseâah, believe it!âif love brings At Christmas-tide, are love's own best; Yea, gifts more real than all the rest: For thoughts are things. IN THE NAME OF THE KING. (Written for the Album of the Children's Building, Columbian Exposition, Chicago, 1893.) Every day of every year is the New World discovered By one, by two, by many who gain a wondrous land. At first they cry, then laugh, then creep, and then, O joy! they stand; Adventurous, with outstretched arm they straightway take command, While subjects true kneel worshiping with bowed heads and uncovered. TO MERODINE. 1895âOctober 26â1896. Little builder of a year,â With many a smile and scarce a tear,â Ah, what wonders thou hast wrought In the realms of love and thought! Thine the rounding of the sphereâ Little builder of a year! THE NIGHTLY REST. A folding darkness hangs before the dawn, Twin curtain with our sleep; And when they part, with mystic, dreamy sweep, The Day smiles in our face, and we awake, Ready once more life's noisy ways to take Till by veiled Night the folds again are drawn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VERS-DE-SOCIÃTÃ AND RANDOM RHYMES THE MINUET. Grandma told me all about it, Told me so I could n't doubt it, How she dancedâmy Grandma danced!â Long ago. How she held her pretty head, How her dainty skirt she spread, Turning out her little toes; How she slowly leaned and roseâ Long ago. Grandma's hair was bright and sunny; Dimpled cheeks, tooâah, how funny! Really quite a pretty girl, Long ago. Bless her! why, she wears a cap, Grandma does, and takes a nap Every single day; and yet Grandma danced the minuet Long ago. Now she sits there, rocking, rocking, Always knitting Grandpa's stockingâ (Every girl was taught to knit Long ago.) Yet her figure is so neat, And her ways so staid and sweet, I can almost see her now Bending to her partner's bow, Long ago. Grandma says our modern jumping, Hopping, rushing, whirling, bumping, Would have shocked the gentle folk Long ago. Noâthey moved with stately grace, Everything in proper place, Gliding slowly forward, then Slowly courtseying back again, Long ago. Modern ways are quite alarming, Grandma says; but boys were charmingâ Girls and boys, I mean, of courseâ Long ago. Brave but modest, grandly shy,â She would like to have us try Just to feel like those who met In the graceful minuet Long ago. Were the minuet in fashion, Who could fly into a passion? All would wear the calm they wore Long ago. In time to come, if I, perchance, Should tell my grandchild of our dance, I should really like to say: âWe did it, dear, in stately way, Long ago.â âWHAT 'S IN A NAME.â Once on a time, where jewels flashed And rose-hid fountains softly plashed, And all the air was sweet and bright With music, mirth and deft delightâ A courtly dame drew, smiling, near A poet, greatest of his time, And chirped a question in his ear With voice like silver bells in chime: âGood Master Shakespeare, I would know The name thy lady bore, in sooth, Ere thine? Nay, little while ago It was, for still we see her youth. Some high-born name, I trow, and yet Though I have heard it, I forget.â Then answered he, With dignity, Yet blithely, as the hour was gay: âAnn Hathaway.â âAnd good, sweet sir,â the dame pursued, Too fair and winsome to be rudeâ â'T is hinted here, and whispered there, By doughty knights and ladies fair, Thatâthatâwell, that her loyal lord Doth e'en obey her slightest will. Now, my good spouse, I pledge my word, Though loving well, doth heed me ill. Her witchery I pray thee tell,â She pleaded, with a pretty frown, âI fain would know what mighty spell Can bring a haughty husband down.â Flushing, she raised her eager face To his, with merry, plaintive grace. Then answered he, With dignity, Yet blithely, as the hour was gay: âFair lady, I can only say, Ann hath a way.â THE LETTER. My letter is finished; but how shall it end? Shall I sign it just âBertha McCaulâ? It 's so awkward to write to a gentleman friend, And to Charlie it 's hardest of all. Shall I say, âYours respectfullyâ? Horrible! No, That would be quite insulting, I'm sure; Or âCordially yoursâ? or âYour friend So-and-soâ? These phrases I cannot endure! Well, âSincerely your friendâ? No, that is n't quite true. Or âYours to commandâ? That 's too meek. âYours as everâ? Oh, shocking! That never would doâ We were strangers till Michaelmas week. I have it! I 've written quite fast (we'll suppose). âYours in haste.â Ah, that hardly sounds right! He may take it in literal earnest,âwho knows?â Which would put me in rather a plight. Dear me! How perplexing! There is an expression That might tell what he never must knowâ And yet, though it almost would be a confession, He 'd hardly interpret it so. 'T is so common to use it; I 've written it often, But ne'er felt its meaning before. He'll never suspect (ah, I see his eye soften While scanning my note o'er and o'er). So I'll say it. Why not? What harm can it do? 'T is written; and now past all mending. âYours trulyââI feel as if somehow he knew, Though it 's really a commonplace ending. MARY, THE COOK. It is strange what a world of romance, What a 'wildering, witching spell, Hangs about Mary, the cook. Why, it 's music to sit in her silence, And (I 'm not ashamed to tell) It 's heaven to catch but her look. She, rubbing the lamps, well might madden The stoniest slave of Aladdinâ In short, if you wish to know sweetness And deftness and magical neatness, You 've only to look At Mary, the cook. You see, as we 're all on a picnic, Some duties must fall to the girls: So Mary is boiling the tea. Ah, who would n't be an old kettle To mirror those tumbled curls, And sing near her heart for glee! Charley and Kate, by the beeches, Are opening pickles and peaches; The others devising a table; While I, like the fox in the fable, Sit vainly and look At Mary, the cook. She 's âsteadyââI 'd swear it. And âsoberâ? Well, noâby that mischievous laugh! âWillingâ? A fellow can't tell, Though she knows how I long to ask her, Or guesses it more than half, Which answers nearly as well. Shall I ask her? (But ah, what effront'ryâ The stunningest girl in the country!) To always beâJove! Is she flushing Over that fireâorâblushing? What if I rose and âtookâ Mary, the cook! Mine! by the grand old beeches! Mine! by the pickles and peaches! Mine! by the rippling brook! Mine! by the sunset splendor! Mine! by the starlight tender! Mary, the cook! LITTLE WORDS. How wise he is! He can talk in Greek! There is n't a language he cannot speak. The very measure the Psalmist sung He carries at will on the tip of his tongue. When he argues in English, why, every word Is almost the biggest that ever you heard! That is, when he talks with Papa it 's soâ With me it 's another affair, you know. Little one-syllable words, you see, Are all he is willing to waste upon me; So he calls me his rose, his bird, his pet, And says it quite often, lest I should forget; While his wonderful verbs grow meagre and small; You 'd think he had ne'er opened RogÃ¨t at all. It 's only: âAh, do you?â or âWill you, my dove?â Or else it 's: âI love,â âI love,â and âI love.â And when we walk out in the starry night, Though he knows the Zodiac's rounded height, With its Gemini, Scorpio, Leo, and all, Its nebulÃ¦, planets, and satellites small, And though, in a flash, he could turn his proud eye on The Dipper, and Crown, and the Belt of Orion;â Not once does he mention the wonders above, But just whispers softly: âMy own!â and âI love!â Whenever they tease meâthe girls and boysâ With: âMrs. Professor,â or âclassical joys,â Or ask if his passion he deigns to speak In Hebrew, or Sanscrit or simple Greek,â I try to summon a look of steel, And hide the joy that I really feel. For they 'd laugh still more if they knew the truth How meek a professor can be, forsooth! Though well I know, in the days to come Great thoughts shall preside in our happy home; And to hold forever his loving looks I must bend my head over musty books, And be as learned as ever I can To do full justice to such a man,â The future is bright, for, like song of birds, My soul is filled with his little words. A THANKSGIVING PARTY. Banks and his wife consulted, One bright November day, Planning a princely dinner In a pleasant, airy way. âWe'll have a grand Thanksgiving,â Said Banks; âand, Polly dear, You get the guests together, And I'll provide the cheer.â Then Banks, with heart o'erflowing, Said, âNow 's the time, my dear, To ask one's wife's relations; So let them all be here. Yes, ask them all, my darling; Your husband 's not the man To stop half-way in making A pleasant family plan.â So Polly asked her people (And they were not a few)â Papa, mama, and brothers, And all her sisters, too. These brought their little childrenâ A laughing, romping crowd; And in the after-dinner speech Banks really did feel âproud.â Yet through it all a shadow Into his bosom stole: He knew what bills were coming in; They paralyzed his soul! He knew that Mother Pippling Was whispering good advice In Polly's ear, and, somehow, That was n't very nice. He knew the romping children Had done him damage dire (For Banks had dainty furniture As any could desire); But still the guests were merry; The dinner âwent off well,â In spite of many vexing things One does n't care to tell. And when, at last, 't was over, And ev'ry guest gone home, The tumbled house quite still again, And resting-time had come, Sweet Mrs. Banks said cheerily: âMy dear, how kind of them To come to us! Though motherââ (Banks softly coughed âAhem!â) âYes, mother noticedâbless her!â One slight omission, dear: She said Thanksgiving dinners Without one âthankâ were queer. I know you don't say grace, dear; But does n't it seem to you That to give thanks at such a time Is what one ought to do?â He fell into a reverie. âYou 're right!â he sighed at last; âThank Heaven the thing is over; They 're gone, and all is past!â And so, in simple language, By that good husband Banks, The grand Thanksgiving dinner Was crowned by hearty thanks. OVER THE WAY. Over the way, over the way, I 've seen a head that 's fair and gray; I 've seen kind eyes not new to tears, A form of grace, though full of yearsâ Her fifty summers have left no flawâ And I, a youth of twenty-three, So love this lady, fair to see, I want her for my mother-in-law! Over the way, over the way, I 've seen her with the children play; I 've seen her with a royal grace Before the mirror adjust her lace; A kinder woman none ever saw; God bless and cheer her onward path, And bless all treasures that she hath, And let her be my mother-in-law! Over the way, over the way, I think I'll venture, dear, some day (If you will lend a helping hand, And sanctify the scheme I 've planned); I'll kneel in loving, reverent awe Down at the lady's feet, and say: âI 've loved your daughter many a dayâ Please won't you be my mother-in-law?â I LOVE MY LOVE. âI love my love with a Y, Because he is young,â answered I. We were only playing a game, But I spoke in truth, all the same, And pretended I did not see The glance that came flashing to me. When next my turn came around I cast my eyes to the ground With âI love my love with a G, Because he is graceful and free.â And there he sat, wondering, by, Quite lame!âthat I could n't deny. And soon, when they wanted to know Why I loved my love with an O, I said, with an air of content, âWhy, because he is opulent.â Then he knew, for he smiled at the wordâ Though you would n't have thought that he heard. Yes, older than I very much, And walking, poor dear! with a crutch, And nothing in bank, so they say, But the little he earns day by dayâ Yet young as a child, and his ways Are graceful beyond poet's praise. And rich? It was only a game, Yet I answered in truth, all the same. SUMMER LONGINGS. Down by the sea, down by the sea, A cool, sandy beach lies a-waiting for me, The waves they may plash; The surf it may dashâ Be it sunshine or storm, for my coming they wait, Starfish and mussel and sweet-smiling skate,â All things of the sea Are waiting for me. Down by the sea, down by the sea, A breezy piazza is waiting for me; And tennis; cool drinks; And golf on the links; And music at nightfall, with lamps on the lawn, And the surf rolling madly from midnight till dawn,â All joys of the sea Are waiting for me. Down by the sea, down by the sea, A beautiful maiden is waiting for me; I know not her name, Nor wherefore she came; But I know, by the moon overhead, that it shines On the shore where a summer girl wanders and pines,â (The maiden, you see, Who 's waiting for me.) Down by the sea, down by the sea, The morrow shall find meâif morrow there be; I'll stay there awhile, And live in her smile; Enjoy the piazza, the surf, and the plash; The tennis; the golf; oh, I'll cut quite a dash! And be happyâso happy!âThen, quite out of cash, Come back from the shore To the dusty old store, And see her no moreâ Heigh-ho! MAMA'S âDAYSâ AT HOME. Now, Bessie, you're my dearest friend, My very best, you know; Our Thursdays without you, dear, Would be just dull and slow. So, darling, please be sure to come; We'll both âreceiveâ in style; Mama is bored, and as for me, It hardly seems worth while, Since everybody knows quite well That I am âcaughtâ at last, A willing and a happy bird, By Jack's dear hand held fast. Who came last week? Well, let me see: Oh, it was grand! The air Was keen and bright, alive with light And gladness everywhere. At three o'clock in walked my boyâ Dear Jack, you know; and, Bess, How perfectly absurd he was, And nice, you 'd never guess. Then others came: a stupid lot, Just fops, some eight or nine; And then a crowd of silly girls.â But Jack, he stayed to dine. Well, Bess, such grand times as we had, With whispering and chaffing! No one was there but mama's friends; I thought we 'd die with laughing. When Jack was gone, two dismal bores Named Jones came in; and then I almost yawned: you never saw Such dreary, gawky men! But when the clock struck half-past eight, Who should come in but Jack? 'T was perfectly ridiculous, And looked quite queer, alack! 'T was such relief to hear his voice And see his noble form! (If Jack should go upon the stage He 'd take the world by storm!) He stayed an hour, and all the while They came by strings and strings, And wished me, oh, so many âjoys,â The kindly, tiresome things! And so it wentâa glorious day Last Thursday was; and thenâ Well, you must know that foolish Jack Came back againâat ten! And until midnight we two sat And talked and laughed together, While poor mama saw all the rest, And talked about the weather. 'T was splendid, dear. And now, my love, You can't know how I'll grieve If you don't come to us next week, And help me to receive. âA dismal prospect,â do you say? Now how can that be true? Jack is no snob, and really, dear, He 's very fond of you. OF ALL THE YEAR. Nora and I in the sunlight basked When the woods were in crimson drest. âOf all the times of the year,â she asked, âWhich is the gladdest? Which is the saddest? And which do you love the best?â I looked in her face with a yearning pain While I answered, as half in jest, âOf all the seasons, in shine or rain, This is the saddest, This is the gladdest, And this do I love the best.â âStupid!â she cried in her laughing voice: âOf spring, summer, winter, or fall, There surely is more than a single choice; To me, one is saddest, Another is gladdest, And one is the dearest of all.â Still I declared that, ask when she would, Though 't were winter or spring or the rest, With her by my side, but one answer seemed good: That would be gladdest, That would be saddest, That season sweetest and best. âWhy, what could it have to be saddest about?â She asked, with a smile at it all. So I told her at once of my pain and doubt, And lo! both our secrets came creeping out In the glory and shade of the fall. And nevermore saddest, But holiest, gladdest, We found the best season of all! AT THE PICTURE-GALLERY. We went to see the pictures, Tom and I, Because, in truth, we both are fond of art; And then, besidesâwell, I will tell you why: We wished to learn each painter's style by heart. We lingered all the afternoon, we twoâ It was so pleasant in the softened light. Around and round we went, each gem to view, And often almost knelt, for better sight. Judging by haltings, and long, eager looks, By rustling converse with our guide and friend, The catalogue had seemed the book of books, And life a stretch of paintings to the end. Picture by picture, page by page, we went, Dubbed this one âperfectâ and that other âpoor.â You never saw two critics so intent; I don't know what folks thought of us, I'm sure. Yet, do you know, some things drive others out: If you had asked me ere another day About the pictures on those walls, I doubt If I had known a single word to say. In fact, that evening, in our homeward walk, We settled much concerning Tom and me; And not one word was said, in all our talk, Of pictures or of paintersâdon't you see? âTHIS WICKED WORLD.â One winter's day, some years ago, I came to dwell on earth; The parish clerk, in legal form, He registered my birth. No pauper I. Ten lovely toes Were mine to have and hold; And also two as rosy fists As e'er made baby bold. I thrived in dreams of catnip tea, And lullaby and rattle; And varied all the waking hours With âgug-gal-looâ for prattle. Then came the first grand balance act, And then the feat of walking; Then âmam-mam,â âpap-pa-pa,â and then The miracle of talking. So far, so good. I 'd tasted joys, And arrow-root, and sweets; And found the world, upon the whole, A realm of jolly treats. But next there rose an alphabet To vex and plague its betters; 'T was now as plain as A, B, C, This was a world of letters. Henceforth life's troubles came and went Like troops of busy weasels: Now 't was a world of whooping-cough, And now a world of measles. Then âtwo times twoâ and âfour and six,â Conspired to vex my slumbers, And prove, since figures never lie, This sphere a world of numbers. So boyhood sped. I learned the power That early pluck discloses; And, for a while, this life stood forth A world of battered noses. Next âLalla Rookhâ and âRasselas,â And thoughts that burned on paper; Hazing; and foot-ball; and âexams;â The student's midnight taper. Then came a glance, a dash of pink, A voice than music sweeter, A lovely formââGood world!â I cried, âThere ne'er was aught completer!â There ne'er was aught so sweet as loveâ That gift of wondrous leaven; It raised the world to Paradiseâ Nay, earth itself was heaven! âMarried and settled,â so men said. The busy years still flew. This was a world of marketing, Yet a world of comfort, too. Money was neededâlittle shoes, And little hats and frocks, And household goodsâand so it grew To be a world of stocks. A world of stocks one hour, and next A world of blessed pleasureâ The home world and the outer world Divided dross and treasure. But all the while a gladsome pulse Within my heart was leaping, Because the Father overhead His watch and ward was keeping. Trouble and joy, and care and pain, They filled the measure duly; Yet that the Lord of all was good I knew and felt it truly. If now and then some injury Was dealt me by my fellow, I tried to think the bruisÃ¨d heart Was only getting mellow. Well, wife and I, still hand in hand, Are trudging on together; We find the world more gold than gilt, More worth than fuss-and-feather. âThis wicked world,â forsooth?âWhy, that 's What puzzles me: to find it Called wholly wicked, when we know There 's so much good behind it. If folks would let the world go by, And just stick close to duty, Taking life's blessings as they come, And drinking in earth's beauty, It seems to me the flag of cant Would in a trice be furled, And only wicked lips would call God's world a wicked world. SNOW-BOUND. How did it happen? Well, you see, Charley called for Mary or me; Sleighing good, and neither lothâ Only wished he could take us both, So he said. And grandmother smiled, Nodding at me: âDress warmly, child.â He looked at Moll As if to say, âToo bad, but we Shall ride some day,â While I, half prompted not to go, Yet feeling, somehow, forced, you know, Ran to get ready, blithely humming, Never dreaming of what was coming. A dear little sleigh and robesâso nice! And though the air was cold as ice, I did n't care one bitânot I. And that horse of Charley's seemed to fly; While the sleigh-bells' ching-a-ling, clear and sweet, Kept tune to my heart's bewildered beat, With their ching-a-ling-ing, And Charley singing âWhat would you do, love?â Through their ringing. Everything was so perfect and bright And sweet and warmâfor a winter nightâ Thatâthatâin fact, though only sleighing, I hardly knew what Charley was saying. Snow-bound? Ah, that is only his joke; There was n't a storm, and nothing broke, And we were n't half dead with cold and fear, Nor buried in drift, as he 'd have it appear. It 's only his way of letting you know Of what befell o'er the crispy snow, While ching-a-ling-ching We slid along, And Charley forgot To end his song, And Iâwell, I was quiet, too, For where was the use, when Charley knew? All in a breath the past grew clear, And life shone forth so dear, so dear! âDrifts,â indeed! and âPity we went!â You might have guessed what his âsnow-boundâ meant. A PROPOSAL BY A MAN OF BUSINESS. My dear Miss B.: Replying to Your favor of this date, Would say, I'm doing well this year, And here beg leave to state That since rents now are going down And wedding-fÃªtes decline, St. Valentine hath tempted me To ask you to be mine. I 've thought this step most squarely out, And counseled with a friend, And so I offer you my hand To hold till life shall end. I do not prate of dews and flowers Or balmy zephyrs sweet, But here I bring an honest life And lay it at your feet. Would add, meanwhile, though I admire And love you as you are, As Mrs. Jones, my own true wife, You 'd be more dear by far. Then, Emma, shall it be in vain My heart goes pit-a-pat? Oh, think what joy 't would be for you And self to take a flat! Or shall it be a corner house, Where you can watch and see Your husband coming up the streetâ Yes, coming home to tea! Ah! since this thought occurred to me I have not even dozed; So kindly answer soonâfor which You'll find a stamp inclosed. P. S. Since writing the above, I find That note was not from you! But still I feel myself inclined To see this matter through: So, Emma, pray do not postpone, But settle it, please do, by 'phone. As per my letter-head you'll see My number is 4â1â6â3. MISS FLIP AT THE EXPOSITION. Oh, Miss Flip of New York City lately went to see the show That was held in gay St. Louis, this season, as you know; And the things that damsel saw and heard, the things she learned and felt, Would fill an anchorite with joy, or heart of Nero melt. I heard her tell her dearest friend about it all one day, And I beg to give the story in her own sweet girlish way. âI saw, oh, Florence, lots of things! The trip was, oh, so fine!â I wore my Ã©cru suit, my dear, with white-embroidered vine. The loveliest machineryâso grand, you know; and then 'T was fun to see them working itâthose earnest, dirty men. My cavalier went wild with rage because I watched them so: These nobby fellows always are so jealous, dear, you know. The fine-art gallery, they say, is nice as it can be; But, really, there was such a crowd, I didn 't try to see. In the Japanese department I bought me such a fan!â I wonder how they ever learned to make things in Japan. And, oh! the way I rushed around, on foot, dear, and in chairs, Was fearful, for in such a place 'most everybody stares. I didn 't mind, because it 's only every hundred years Centennials come, and no one cares how just one girl appears (So uncle said). But one can't help one's feelings, after all, When your feathers get so limpsy and your sleeves look crushed and small. But it really is, when all is done, a satisfaction, dear, To have seen the Exposition, and not seem green and queer. And then, the silks and flowers, and summer thingsâoh, my! They make you wild, because, you see, you always want to buy. To see them does expand the mind, and give you new ideas: I'm going to copy me a dress that 's shown by Madame Speers; I'm going to get a new hat, too, made just like one I sawâ A perfect darling!âjust a mass of roses, tulle, and straw! I saw a real live Turk one day (but didn 't like to look), All dressed in big red bloomers, like a picture in a book. You need n't go abroad this year, for all the world is there; And, really, I do feel as if I 'd been 'most everywhere. There 's everything on earth to seeâsuch jewelry and lace! And all the buildings lit at night! It 's just the sweetest place! We strolled into the restaurants, and had a heavenly time With Mr. F? and Harry B?, who really turned out prime. Such lovely cream! although they charge outrageously, they sayâ Which doesn't matter much to girls, as we don't have to pay. You see the Alps and tropics, too, and every famous spot, And I went all through âCreationââthough I 'd really rather not. But oh, how fine the lagoons are!âthey 're all shown in the bookâ And the buildings are just splendid, though you have n't time to look. And, do you know, it's not three years since work out there began! Don't engineers and builders prove how wonderful is man? Oh, the palaces and places where there was so much to learn! But, as for that, I passed them all with perfect unconcernâ Because we girls of nowadaysâwell, you know how we do: We learn so much we really feel as if we ought n't to. Papa says it 's the greatest show the world has ever seen, And he 's glad that we went early while the buildings were so clean. But poor papa! the bills! the bills! Why, darling, as I live, Your money just evaporates!âlike water through a sieve. Lord Darnkie made a splendid joke, one day, about the show; He saidâhe saidâwell, I forget just what he said, you know. But, really, he is droll at timesâhis views are, oh, so queer! Once, when I asked him if he sang, he drawled: âI have no ee-ah!â And Harry said a silly thingâhe may have meant it, too! He said: âYou think those bracelets dear? they can't be dear as you!â These witty men are always saying clever things to girls. But when I think of all I said, my brain it really whirls. And oh, those queer, outlandish sights you do see on the Pike, Where all the people seem to do exactly as they like! I walked and turned and twisted until I thought I 'd drop! But now I 've talked you almost deaf, and it is time to stop. Oh, mercy on us! I must go. But I'm glad I' ve seen the show, And told you all about it, and the things you ought to know.â A QUANDARY. Tell my lady she is fair? That no news is, truly. Tell her she is sweet and rare? Pure and lovely past compare? Will it strike her newly? No; some other way to woo Must be mine to win her. What tho' I am fond and true? All the world adores her, tooâ Such a spell is in her. Ah, I have 't! I'll stay away, Though I wander sadly. Then, to say her gentle ânay,â She must send for me some day. And I'll go right gladly. LIFE IN LACONICS. Given a roof, and a taste for rations, And you have the key to the âwealth of nations.â Given a boy, a tree, and a hatchet, And virtue strives in vain to match it. Given a pair, a snake, and an apple, You make the whole world need a chapel. Given âno cards,â broad views, and a hovel, You have a realistic novel. Given symptoms and doctors with potion and pill, And your heirs will ere long be contesting your will. That good leads to evil there 's no denying: If it were not for truth there would be no lying. âI'm nobody!â should have a hearse; But then, âI'm somebody!â is worse. âFolks say,â etcetera! Well, they should n't, And if they knew you well, they would n't. When you coddle your life, all its vigor and grace Shrink away with the whisper: âWe 're in the wrong place.â âA miss is as good as a mile,â they say. But I walked two miles and she gave me ânay.â And the hateful puzzle about all this is, Two miles did n't turn that Miss into Mrs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET. âOne to the fields, the other to the hearth.â Leigh Hunt. THE GRASS-WORLD. Oh, life is rife in the heart of the year, When midsummer suns sail high; And under the shadow of spike and spear, In the depth of the daisy sky, There 's a life unknown to the careless glance; And under the stillness an airy prance, And slender, jointed things astir, And gossamer wings in a sunny whir,â And a world of work and dance. Soft in its throbbing, the conscious green Demurely answers the breeze; While down in its tangle, in riotous sheen, The hoppers are bending their knees; And only a beetle, or lumbering ant, As he pushes a feathery spray aslant,â Or the sudden dip of a foraging bird, With its vibrant trail of the clover stirred, Discovers the secret haunt. Ah, the grass-world dies in the autumn days, When, studded with sheaf and stack, The fields lie browning in sullen haze, And creak in the farmer's track. Hushed is the tumult the daisies knew, The hidden sport of the supple crew; And lonely and dazed in the glare of day, The stiff-kneed hoppers refuse to play In the stubble that mocks the blue. For all things feel that the time is drear When life runs low in the heart of the year. CONFIDENCES. I watched a butterfly on the wing; I saw him alight on a sunny spray. His pinions quivered; The blossom shivered; I know he whispered some startling thing. But why so bold, Or what he told, While poising there on the sunny spray, I never have learned to this blessÃ¨d day. I watched a brave young cavalier; I saw him steal to a maiden gay. Swift words he muttered; The maiden fluttered; I know his whisper she flushed to hear. But why so bold, Or what he told, While bending there by the maiden gay, She never has owned to this blessÃ¨d day. HUBER. A blind man under the linden trees, Listening hour by hour. The tall, white clover is tapping his kneesâ Impatient, eager flower! âSee! See! He comes. My bee! Good friend, you know who is come to me!ââ And now the blind man sees. He sees! Oh, wonderful eyes of the sense and soul, Eyes that, seeing the least so well, Must see the whole! And, bees,â With your booms and buzzings that daze the air, Your droning cadence with mystic swell, Your pilot flights and reckonings rare, And the hoards you drew From bloom and dew,â Do you know of the hoard you have stored for him Who works and waits in the darkness dim? From fields where our easy vision fails In the light where our sunniest sunlight pales, You carry your store Of Nature's lore. Your lives and secrets his soul doth scan, Giving him glimpse of the Infinite Plan. Wonderful, wonderful bees,â For Huber sees! FIRE-FLIES. See the air filling near by and afar,â A shadowy hostâhow brilliant they are! Silently flitting, spark upon spark, Gemming the willows out in the dark; Waking the night in a twinkling surprise, Making the star-light pale where they rise; Snowing soft fire-flakes into the grass, Lighting the face of each daisy they pass; Startling the darkness, over and over, Where the sly pimpernel kisses the clover; Piercing the duskiest heights of the pines; Drowsily poised on the low-swinging vines; Suddenly shifting their tapers around, Now on the fences, and now on the ground, Now in the bushes and tree-tops, and then Pitching them far into darkness again; There like a shooting-star, slowly on wing, Here like the flash of a dowager's ring; Setting the dark, croaking hollows a-gleam, Spangling the gloom of the ghoul-haunted stream; They pulse and they sparkle in shadowy play, Like a night fallen down with its stars all astray; They pulse and they flicker, they kindle afar, A vanishing host,âbut how brilliant they are! THE UMPIRES. I. We chose our blossoms, sitting on the grass; His, Marguerites, with sunny, winsome faces, Mine the bright clover, with its statelier graces. âLet these decide the argument, my lass; We'll watch,â said he, âthe light-winged breezes pass And note which first the earliest whiff displaces; If it be daisy, yours the sore disgrace is, And be it clover, then I yield, alas!â The lightsome quarrel was but half in jest; I would go homeward; he would sit and restâ The foolish cousin whom I would not wed. Smiling we waited; not a word we said. In earnest he, and I quite debonairâ But oh, the stillness of that summer air! II. So still it wasâso still with quiet heat, The blossom lately from the brooklet quaffing Ceased its brisk dipping and sly telegraphing, And scorned the blossom opposite to greet. The very grass stood breathless at our feet; When, suddenly, our weighty silence chaffing, The leaves around broke out in muffled laughing, And something stirred the fickle Marguerite! âYour flower!â I cried.ââAh, now it bends quite over!â âOho!â he answeredââsee your nodding clover!â In truth, those silly blossoms fluttered so, I really knew not if to stay or go.â And so it happened that the twilight found me Still resting there,âand Charlie's arm around me. CARNIVOROUS PLANTS. What's this I hear, My Molly dear, About the new carnivora? Can little plants Eat bugs and ants And gnats and flies?â Why, bless my eyes! Who is the great diskiverer? Not Darwin, love, For that would prove Unmeet for his parading; Surely the fare Of flowers is air, Or sunshine sweet;â They should n't eat Or do aught so degrading. If it, alas! Should come to pass That Fido here should die,âoh, let It not be said: âThe dog is dead, Because one day In thoughtless play He went too near a violet.â Oh, horror! What If, heeding not, Some cruel plant carnivorous We ventured nearâ Yes, we, my dearâ And slaughtered were, With no one there To succor or deliver us! And yet, to die By blossoms, I Would call a doom ecstatic. For one might wait A harder fate Than have a rose End all his woes In pain so aromatic! Let Science blame Each flower by name, And all its wicked habits. 'T is not for us To make a fuss; For aught we know, The lilies grow From dining on âWelsh rabbitsâ! But this I'll say: If you, one day, Should have some fierce bud growing, For my sake, dear, Let placards near Say, by your bower: âBeware the flower!â Lest I should come, unknowing. WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS. Two little sorrel blossoms, pale and slender, Lean to each other in the cool, tall grass; The crowding spears with gallant air and tender, Shield them completely from the sun's fierce splendor, Till harmlessly an angry wind might pass. And I stand smiling with a sudden whim: âThe little innocents! Now am I sure They think them in a forest grand and dim, The mighty grass coeval with their birth,â Shut from the world, from every ill secure, And where their thicket ends, there ends the earth!â A TALE OF THANKS. Dear rose! that tinted my baby's cheek, I praise thee more than words can speak; And gentian! darling of autumn skies, I thank thee for her soft blue eyes; Oh, summer brook! from thy ripples bright Her smiles do borrow their dancing light; And satin cell of the chestnut burr, What lustre of hair thou hast lent to her! Oh, lithe young sapling, growing apace, Honor to thee for her supple grace; And living sunshine, well I know Thou gavest her warm young heart its glow. In truth, not a charm of earth or sky But comes for my girl to pattern by; And truly I thank you, every one, For the sweetest lassie the sun shines on! READING. One day in the bloom of a violet I found a simple word; And my heart went softly humming it, Till the violet must have heard. And deep in the depth of a crimson rose A writing showed so plain, I scanned it over in veriest joy To the patter of summer rain. And then from the grateful mignonette I readâah, such a thing! That the glad tears fell on it like dew, And my soul was ready to sing. A few little words! Before that day I never had taken heed; But, oh, how I blessed the love that cameâ The love that taught me to read! âNOW THE NOISY WINDS ARE STILL.â Now the noisy winds are still; April 's coming up the hill! All the spring is in her train, Led by shining ranks of rain; Pit, pat, patter, clatter, Sudden sun, and clatter, patter!â First the blue, and then the shower; Bursting bud, and smiling flower; Brooks set free with tinkling ring; Birds too full of song to sing; Crisp old leaves astir with pride, Where the timid violets hide,â All things ready with a will,â April 's coming up the hill! FULFILLMENT. Waking in May, the peach-tree thought: âIdle and bare and weaving naught! Here have I slept the winter throughâ I with my Master's work to do!â Started the buds. The blossoms came, Till all the branches were a-flame. She rocked the birds, and wove the green, A busy tree as ever was seen. Busy and blithe, she drank the dew; She caught the sunbeams gliding through; She drew her wealth from sky and soil, And rustled gayly in her toil. Now see the peach-tree's drooping head, With all her fruit a-blushing red! Knowing her Master's work is done, She meekly resteth in the sun. TWO SUMMER DAYS. âJune 17th. âIt was only a little bunch of clover-blossoms gathered for her, near a way-side station, soon after our parties were introduced on the East-bound train. But how much it meant! That was just one year ago to-day,âand now we are going back together!ââ From his Letter. A year ago this day, my girl, The clover told a thing to you, Amid the stir and noisy whirl Of wheels, as toward his home we flew; And now you know how fond and true The thing the clover said to you. With modest mirth and girlish grace, You took the gift and lightly smiled; You pressed it softly to your face, (What wonder that the flower grew wild!) And now, in thought, again we trace, The clover bloom, the girlish grace. Over the self-same road again You journey,âyours the homeward way; And bright upon that Western plain The nodding clover smiles to-day; And still, though not in lightsome play, It has a blessed thing to say. Still waves the clover in the sun, And whispers near the whirring track: âTwo lives are floating into one, Two travellers are speeding back. God bless them both till Heaven is won, And bless the love in bloom begun!â A GROUP OF BIRTHDAY VERSES WRITTEN ON THE ROAD. Out in the sunshine fair and free, Flecked by the blossoming, re-born tree, Bathed in the pale, pure light of Spring, While men look up, and the glad birds sing,â There, dear friend, let thy reck'ning be, So let thy birthdays come to thee! Firm as the tall, brave trunks around; Full of life as the flower-full ground; Free as the boughs that sweep the blue; Bright as the violet's sudden hue;â So let thy life-long reck'ning be, So let thy birthdays come to thee! It was cool and gray in the twilight mornâ A prophecy sweetestâwhen thou wast born; And if daylight gathered a cloud or two That floated beside thee when life was new, Thy noon will be sunny and clear, I know, And holy and peaceful thine evening glow: For good and true shall thy reck'ning be Till all thy birthdays are come to thee. MILE-STONES. Mile-stones fair on the road of life, Thy birthdays bright appearâ One by one, erect and clear, Triumphant, and with meaning rife. Lead on, O birthdays of my friend, With joy and peace between! And be ye guides and monuments Of all that he hath been, And all he is, and yet shall be Through time and blest eternity! âEVERY DAY A BIRTHDAY IS.â Every day a birthday is, Into an unknown world: Life, with its changes infinite, Keepeth its counsel well; The gain, the good, the sin in it Only each day may tell. Between the dawns comes man's first breath; Between the dawns, man's hour of death. Yet, by the twelvemonth do we keep The record of our stay: So, when, no longer desolate, Forests grow green and sweet, And nature in her fair estate Flings blossoms at thy feet, We hail thee, richer by a year,â We hail thee, comrade tried and dear! Wishing is givingâsoul to soul. What shall I wish this day? I wish thee peace and happiness, And work and honored meed; I wish thy sorrows tardiness, And every joy God-speed! I wish thee all I may, dear friend; God's grace; and manhood to the end! ONE DAY IN MAY. It passed us byâI know not whyâ Without a sign or token; Another year in gliding by No parting word had spoken! It went its way one day in May When Time was softly speeding: A brave, fresh year before thee lay, And there I sat, unheeding! Then she, the good, in tender mood Spoke of the years' swift gliding, And Iâthe laggard!âunderstood The thing thou hadst been hiding. By twilight's glow, sweet flowers we brought And gave thee happy greeting; In cheery, home-lit ways we sought To mark the day's completing. Thus, one by one, they westward runâ Thy years; and so we find them A proud surprise, at set of sun,â A trail of flowers behind them. TO A YOUNG GIRL. WITH A SPRAY OF AUTUMN LEAVES. Though Autumn winds be sighing in your future, Molly dear, Their music may be sweeter than the early Spring-time cheer; As the fleeting moments ripen in the fullness of your prime, There'll be tints and shadows richer far than those of Summer-time; And so, these leaves prophetic made me dream, my girl, of you, As they trembled in their gladness, with the sunlight shining through. SECRETS. I'd like to be a daisy In the clover, That I might look up bravely At my lover. I 'd bid the willing breezes Bend me sweet, That I might, as he passed me, Touch his feet; I 'd let the dew so quickly Start and glisten, That, thinking I had called him, He would listen. Yet would he listen vainlyâ Happy me! No bee could find my secret; How could he? If ever of the clover Couch he made, I 'd softly kiss his eyelids In the shade. Then would I breathe sweet incense All for him, And fill with perfect bloom The twilight dim. What should I do, I wonder, When he went? Why, I wouldâlike a daisyâ Be content. Alack! to live so bravely, Peace o'erladen, Has ne'er been granted yet To simple maiden. UNISON Over us the wild, cool Night Spread her dark tresses heavy with quick gems, Till in the twinkling blackness, lithe and light, We felt like wood-flowers swung on hidden stems. A WELCOME. The great, slow sea and the wide, wide sky, With never a fleck on the blue or the sea; The quick, glad rush of the wave to the shoreâ So may our love and our meetings be. TO A FRIEND. I roamed with thee the mountain-side, And, with thee, watched the shadows fall; The sun went down, but night flung wide A glory mightier than all. And we have walked the fields, we twain, And said: âHow fair the distance shows! How far they blendâthe sky and plain! How holy-bright the twilight glows!â And, hill or plain, thy soul was high,â High as the peaks that lift to God; And not more true than thee the sky That shone, as on our way we trod. THE FLOWERS. They're coming! they're coming! 'T is writ on the air, In incense and harmony Breathed everywhere! Winds murmur no longer Their woe to the pinesâ But spiders are spinning Their gossamer lines. Blue-birds are darting The branches among, Wild with a pleasure Only half sung. Willows are greening Down by the brook; Insects are stirring In forest and nook; Sunlight is bringing Buttercups sweetâ Hear the grass whisper Under our feet! Telling of daisies, Telling of clover, Telling of beauty All the world over. They 're coming! They 're coming! The beautiful throng, To soothe us and cheer us The whole summer long. By brook, and in meadow, Woodland and glade, Through moonlight and star-light Sunshine and shade, They 're creeping, they 're springing, They 're climbing the hill, They 're twining and clingingâ Though underground still; The blue-birds have called them,â The roses and all; They have heard, and already They answer the call! O Snow-white and Purple, Pink, Yellow and Blue! Lie close to their hearts Till the day they come through O Spirit of Beauty! Spirit of Grace! Still bide ye above them Watching the place. Fragrance and loveliness Still hover near, Soon shall your hosts In their glory appear. Surely the Spring-time Is crowning its hoursâ They 're coming! They 're comingâ The beautiful flowers! A SONG OF MAY. My heart is light with May, with May, My heart is light with May! The sky is soft; the coming birds Are silent on their way. The miracle of flower and fruit Not yet the Lord hath wrought; But never ripened Summer-time So bright a day hath brought. For there is promise in the air, And murmurous prophecy; All breathless and with lifted arms, Stand waiting shrub and tree. To-morrow shall the blossoms glow; At dawn the birds will sing; All through the stillness deep I hear The rushing tide of Spring. My heart is light with May, with May, My heart is light with May! And all the more that coming birds Are silent on their way. BLOSSOM-SNOW. March came one morn to the door of May, And begged the maiden to let him stay. âI went too soon,â was his whining prayer, âI knew not the earth could grow so fair.â So she let him in; and he promised her He would hardly breathe and never stir. And all day long he kept his word; Naught from the sly old guest was heard. Now and then he would breathe a sigh And startle the blue-birds passing by; Or hidden violets uncover, Or try to blow some daisy over; Yet, for the rest, he kept his word,â He hardly breathed, and he never stirred, Till the sweet May murmured: âNow, my dear, We really do not need you here, My flowers are frightenedâdon't you see? They 'd rather be alone with me.â High overhead the blossoms hung; Full gently had the tree-tops swung. But now he rose in sudden wrath And whitened all the sunny path. âOho!â cried he, âif I must go I'll turn her blossoms into snow!â Clinging and warm, they felt the spell. Ah, how they fluttered, floated, fell! The air was full of eddying bloom,â A lightsome, flowery dance of doom. In flurried heaps at last it lay, Or drifted silently away; And still he shook, âGood-bye! Good-bye!â Then vanished in the trackless sky. The branches whispered: âNow for fruit!â And thrilled with joy from tip to root. May, kneeling, kissed the fragrant ground; The air was filled with peace profound; For all things smiled, and seemed to know The promise of the blossom-snow. GREETINGS. âGood day!â cried one who drove to West, âGood day!â the other, Eastward bound;â Strong, hearty voices both, that rang Above their wagons' rattling sound. And I, within my snug home nest, âGood day! good day!â still softly sang. I saw them not, yet well I knew How much a cheery word can do, How braced those hearts that on their way Speed, each to each, a brave âGood day!â THE CONCERT. Such a concert, dear, as I've had to-night! Full of sweet sound and deep delight; And yet âthe houseâ was poor; Poor, if you count by crowded seats; But judging only by glad heart-beats, 'T was a splendid house, I'm sure. First, Baby sang as well as she could Some sweet little notes that I understood; And wee Kate's chirp of a laugh broke out As Willy ran in with a merry shout; The pussy purred on the rug in state, And the good clock ticked: âIt 's late! it 's late!â While faint in the shadows the cricket sang, And the kettle hummed with a plaintive twang. That was Part First, you must know, my dear, When only we five were there to hear; The fagots crackled applause; The baby's soft little pat-a-cake Made reckless encores for the music's sake, And âlullabyâ brought us the pause. Well, the Second Part? Ah that was fineâ Fine to the heart's core, lover mine! For over the kettle's winsome plaint, And the baby's breathing, sweet and faint, And over the prattle of Will and Kate, And the clock's impatient âLate! it 's late!â I heard the blessedest sound of allâ A click of the latch, a step in the hall! And âHome, sweet homeâ pulsed all the air As you came calling up the stair. ANOTHER YEAR. Old man with the hour-glass, halt! halt! I prayâ Don't you see you are taking my children away? My own little babies who came long ago, You stole them, old man with the beard white as snow! My beautiful babies, so bonny and bright! Where have you carried them, far out of sight? Oh, dimpled their cheeks were, and sunny their hair! But I cannot find them; I 've searched everywhere. My three-year-old toddlers, they shouted in glee; They sported about me; they sat on my knee. Oh, their prattle and laughter were silvery rain! Old man, must I list for their voices in vain? They were here; they were gone while their kisses were warm. I scarce knew the hour when they slipped from my armâ Oh! where was I looking when, peerless and sweet, They followed the track of your echoless feet? My brave little school-boys who ran in and out, And lifted the air with their song and their shout: My boys on the coldest days ever a-glow, My dear, romping school-boys who bothered me so! There were two of them then; and one of the twoâ Ah! I never was watchful enoughâfollowed you. My chubby-faced darling, my kite-flying petâ Alack! all his playthings are lying here yet. And the other. O Time! do not take him away! For a few precious years, I implore, let him stay. I love himâI need himâmy blessing and joy! You have had all the rest; leave me one little boy! He halts! He will stop! No; the fall of the sand In the hour-glass deceived me. It seemed at a stand. But whom have we here? Jamie! Harry! how? why, Just as many as everâand Time passing by? Jamie, my bouncer, my man-boy, my pride! Harry, my sunbeam, whatever betideâ I can hardly believe it. But surely it 's clear My babies, my toddlers, my school-boys are here! Move on then, O Time! I have nothing to say, You have left me far more than you 've taken away, And yet I would whisper a word ere you go; You 've a year of my Harry'sâthe last one, you knowâ How does it rank among those that have flown? Was it worthily used when he called it his own? God filled it with happiness, comfort and healthâ Did my darling spend rightly its Love-given wealth? No answer in words. Yet it really did seem That the sand sparkled lightlyâthe scythe sent a gleam. Is it answer and promise? God grant it be so, From that silent old man with the beard white as snow. MOTHERLESS. âI wish she had not died,â she said; The words were soft and low; âMost little girls like me, papa, Have dear mammas, you know. âThere 's Lulu Hart next door. Oh, dear! I think it is so sweet To have your mother nod to you Across the window-seat. âAnd often when we 're playing games, Lu throws a kiss up there; And when she rolls her hoople well, She knows some one will care. âDo you think God was good to take My own mamma away? For I was just a baby thenâ Papa, why don't you say?â âYes, yes, my child,â he sobbed. âMamma Is very happy, dear.â His little girl sprang up, nor cared Another word to hear. âWhy, papa, crying! Please don't cry. Do you feel sorry, too? Now, papa, see. I never meant I did n't care for you. âPoor eyes! all wet. I 'll kiss them dry. What 's in your pocket? See. Oh, where 's your watch? Now, wont you please Just make it tick for me? âIt 's nice to have a dear papa;â How big it is, and bright! I hear it ticky, ticky, tick! It 's very loud to-night. âRide me to Banbury Cross, papa! Now don't you let me fall. When I was littler, how I slipped! I could n't keep on at all. âOh, there 's the tea-bell! Now you 've tossed My hair like everything! I 'll toss yours, too. Oho! oho! You look just like a kingâ âFor kings have crowns, you know, papa, And your hair 's standing straight. I knew you 'd laugh. There, now, you 're goodâ Come, quick, and show Aunt Kate.â Aunt, at the table, glanced at one, Then, slyly, at the other; She could not think what hidden thing Had happened to her brother. His shining hair stood like a crown, His smile was warm and bright,â âWhy, John,â she said, âyou really seem Like your old self to-night.â THE FOOT-PRINT IN THE SNOW. Heavy and white the cold snow lay, As, nearing my cottage one winter day, I saw by the porch a foot-print small, A bare little foot-print, toes and all, Pressedâah, so wearily!âinto the snow, As if the wee step had been jaded and slow. âPoor little homeless waif!â I thought; But the fleeting sympathy came to naughtâ For pity may fall from a heart that 's gay As lightly as snow-flakes melting away; And soon would be greeting me, strong in their charms, Bright little faces and warm little arms. Closing the door, in a joyous glow, I chided the children for crowding me soâ The glad little witches! as sunny and blessed As ever a home-coming mother caressed. Then I caught up the youngest, unnoticed before, My sweet little Mabel, who sat on the floor. âWhy, my darling! What is it?â I cried, in surprise; âBarefooted!â The little one lifted her eyes; They were brimming with tears, and her cheek, too, was wetâ âOh, my feet hurt me so!â âWhat has harmed them, my pet?â âWhy, just to see how it felt, you know, I stood with my shoes off out there in the snow.â That was all. But while fondling and making them warmâ The dear little feet that had tempted the stormâ And putting on soft little stocking and shoe, A feeling of sudden remorse pierced me through. That lingering foot-print! How soon I forgot When I thought 't was a beggar-child passed by my cot! O pale-blossomed pity that never bore fruit!â I will pluck it away from my heart, branch and root. Love teaches at last. Now their meaning I knowâ The bare little foot-prints we see in the snow. MOTHER GOOSE FOR BIG FOLKS. Not only the little toddlers, Perched high on papa's toe, Bound for a ride to London town, On childish journeys goâ For we all go up, up, up, And all go down, down, down-y, And all go backward and forward, And all go round, round, round-y. Still do we reach for sunbeams, And learn the rattle's trick. The great big watch of Father Timeâ We love to hear it tick! To pat a cake for our Tommy, And pat a cake for one's selfâ For that alone we labor and strive, And hoard up our golden pelf. This little pig goes to market; This little pig stays at home; And we all cry âWee!â for our mammy, Wherever we chance to roam. We seek our bed with Sleepyhead; We stay awhile with Slow; And fill the pot with Greedy, glad To sup before we go. When Jack and Jill go up the hill To fetch their pail o' water, As sure as Jack comes tumbling down Poor Jill comes tumbling arter. Mistress Marys are still contrary; Marjorie Daws still sell; And Mother Hubbards ransack their cupboards For bones for the ne'er-do-well. Jack Horners in their corners still Do ply the busy thumb, And âWhat a big boy!â we always cry Whenever we see the plum. Our wise men into brambles yet Do jump with might and main; And those who go to sea in bowls Rarely come back again. âWhat do you want?â âA pot o' beer.â Alack, the bitter wrong! That grenadier an army hath How many million strong! And don't some hearts, deploring The things that gnaw and harrow, Let fall the wheelbarrow, wife and all, When lanes are rough and narrow? Ah, yes! the old rhymes suit us As well as ever they did; For the gist of our lives, from first to last, Is under their jingle hidâ As we all go up, up, up, And all go down, down, down-y, And all go backward and forward, And all go round, roundy, round-y. HOME AND MOTHER. Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; Mother is with thee, By, baby, by. There, baby. (Oh, how the wild winds wail!) Hush, baby. (Turning to sleet and hail; Ah, how the pine-tree moans and mutters!â I wonder if Ellen will think of the shutters?) Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; Mother is with thee, By, baby, by. Rest thee. (She could n't have left the blower Down in the parlor? There 's so much to show her!) By-by, my sweetest. (Now the rain 's pouring! Is it wind or the dining-room fire that 's roaring?) Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; Mother is with thee, By, baby, by. How lovely his forehead!âmy own blessed pet! He 's nearly asleep. (Now I must n't forget That pork in the brine, and the stair-rods to-morrow.) Heaven shield him forever from trouble and sorrow! Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; Mother is with thee, By, baby, by. Those dear little ringlets, so silky and bright! (I do hope the muffins will be nice and light.) How lovely he is! (Yes, she said she could fry.) Oh, what would I do if my baby should die! Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; Mother is with thee, By, baby, by. That sweet little hand, and the soft, dimpled cheek! Sleep, darling. (I'll have his clothes shortened this week. How tightly he 's holding my dress! I'm afraid He'll wake when I move. There! his bed is n't made! Sleep, my own darling, By, baby, by; In thy soft cradle Peacefully lie. (He 's settled at last. But I can't leave him so, Though I ought to be going this instant, I know. There 's everything standing and waiting down-stairs. Ah me, but a mother is cumbered with cares!) A MONDAY ROMANCE. Biddy was at the wash-tubs, Her arms in the lather white; At the scullery door, with a basket, The baker, her own true knight. âSet down the loaves,â said Biddy, In a voice of careless scorn. âDon't ye mind I am busy a-wringin'? Bring rolls on the morra morn.â âAh, Biddy, Biddy, Biddy, It 's always wringin' ye be!â Sighed Lanty, moving streetward, âAnd the thing ye wring is me.â Then, quick, a thought came o'er him, And back he stepped to say: âIs it muffins ye'll be a-wantin', Or buns, for the missus' tay?â Now stands she by the boiler, Laden with clean wet âclo'esâ; Her eyes are bright as the morning, Her cheeks as red as a rose. âOch! go yer ways. We'll be sendin'; I have n't the time to say; I must mind me bleachin' an' bluin' Awhile I 've the best o' the day.â She ran to the garden grass-plot, While he went out to the street: âIt 's me ye are bleachin' an' bluin', Oh, Biddy, so pretty and sweet!â At noon, in ending his circuit, He âstopped to see Biddy a minuteâ; The kitchen was open and sunny, But âsorra a Biddy was in it.â Soon, eagerly, through the window Her lithe little form he was spying. He called. But she answered him coldly: âIt 's hangin' I am, while there 's drying.â âIt 's hangin' I'll be, cruel Biddy!â He said to himself at the hint. âFor the matter o' that, I am thinkin', My hangin' would make her contint.â Once more, in the top of the evening, When supper was well cleared away, Bold Lanty, in holiday raiment, Dropped in, and had courage to stay. On the clothes-line that criss-crossed the kitchen Hung snowy-white things, chill and damp; But the coals in the range crackled brightly, And Biddy had lighted her lamp. Full thickly the garments were hangingâ Grim collars and things nearly dried, And, largest of all, near the dresser, A table-cloth snowy and wide. âThe shower wet me wash afther dinner, An' I hung 'em within so, to dry. Och hone! but I wish you was married!â Said Biddy, pretending to sigh. âIs it married ye wish I was, Biddy? Faix, meself do be wishin' that same; An', in thruth, that I'm single this minute It is n't mesel' that 's to blame.â âAnd who, thin?â asked Biddy, akimbo. âGo and have her, for all I would care!â Then stepped out of sight, quite forgetting The lamp with its tale-telling glare. Now up starts the gallant young Lanty, For dark on the cloth he espies, As it hangs there, the shadow of Biddy, Her apron held up to her eyes! âArrah, Biddy, me darlint, what ails ye? You're kapin' me singleâoch hone! It 's yoursel' can be makin' me marriedâ Say, will you, dear Biddy Malone?â Only two empty chairs by the fire, And two shadow forms on the cloth; But love is the same the world over, And Biddy no longer was wroth. THE ZEALLESS XYLOGRAPHER. (Dedicated to the End of the Dictionary.) A Xylographer started to cross the sea By means of a Xanthic Xebec; But, alas! he sighed for the Zuyder Zee, And feared he was in for a wreck. He tried to smile, but all in vain, Because of a Zygomatic pain; And as for singing, his cheeriest tone Reminded him of a Xylophoneâ Or else, when the pain would sharper grow, His notes were as keen as a Zuffolo. And so it is likely he did not find On board Xenodochy to his mind. The fare was poor, and he was sure Xerophagy he could not endure; Zoophagous surely he was, I aver, This dainty and starving Xylographer. Xylophagous truly he could not beâ No sickly vegetarian he! He 'd have blubbered like any old Zeuglodon Had Xerophthalmia not come on. And the end of it was he never again In a Xanthic Xebec went sailing the main. THE SAD STORY OF LITTLE JANE. A CALENDAR OF WOE. JANâe, little saint, was hard to nurse, FEBârifuge she had none; MARâmalade seemed to make her worse, APRâicots were all gone. MAYâbe, she thought, on some fair plain, JUNEâberries sweet may grow; JULYâ'twas late, they searched in vain, AUGâmenting all her woe. SEPTâimus failed to find a pillâ OCTâoroon slave was he; NOVâice, poor thing! at feeling ill, DECâeased ere long was she. MY DOG. I love my dogâa beautiful dog, Brave and alert for a race; Ready to frolic with baby or man; Dignified, too, in his place. I like his barkâa resonant bark, Musical, honest, and deep; And his swirling tail and his shaggy coat And his sudden, powerful leap. Never a smug little pug for me, Nor a spitz with treacherous snap! Never a trembling, pattering hound, Nor a poodle to live on my lap! No soft-lined basket for bed has Jack, Nor bib, nor luxurious plate; But our open door, that he guards so well, And the lawn are his royal state. No dainty leading-ribbon of silk My grand, good dog shall fret; No golden collar needs he to show He 's a very expensive pet; But just my loving voice for a chain, His bound at my slightest sign, And the faith when we look in each other's eyes Proclaim that my dog is mine. He never was carried in arms like a babe, Nor dragged like a toy, all a-curl; For he proudly knows he 's a dog, does Jack,â And I'm not that sort of a girl. KATRINKA. Katrinka, fresh as the morning, Gazed from her casement low; Far off, the great-sailed windmills Stood darkly in a row, And the sky with the changing splendor Of dawn was all aglow. âI wonder,â thought the maiden, Thrilled with the glorious sight, âIf all the beauty around us, And all the love and delight, Come flooding the earth at sunrise To bide with us, day and night? âI wonder if all the goodness That makes us steady and true Glides softly in with the dawning To gladden us through and throughâ To lift our hearts to the Giver, And help us in all we do? âYet, whether we lose it or keep it Depends upon many a thing: Whether we 're lazy or busy; Whether we grumble or sing; Whether our thoughts are noble, Or whether they grovel and sting. âOh, the wonderful sky!â sighed Katrinka, âHow grand!âBut the day has begun; There 's breakfast, and spinning, and mending, And the kettles to shineâone by one. Good-by, you dear, beautiful morning! There 's so much to do; I must run.â Bright little maiden, Katrinka, In the land of the dike and the sea! They who live in the glow of the dawning Are, all the world over, like thee. Bearers of sunlight and gladness, Faithful in shadow and sadnessâ The path of the day is diviner Wherever their light may be. AN APRIL GIRL. The girl that is born on an April day Has a right to be merry, lightsome, gay; And that is the reason I dance and play And frisk like a mote in a sunny ray. Would n't you Do it, too, If you had been born on an April day? The girl that is born on an April day Has a royal right to cry, they say; And so I sometimes do give way When things get crooked or all astray. Would n't you Do it, too, If you had been born on an April day? The girls of March love noise and fray; And sweet as blossoms are girls of May; But I belong to the time midwayâ And so I rejoice in a sunny spray Of smiles and tears and hap-a-dayâ Would n't you Do it, too, If you had been born on an April day? Heigh-ho! and hurrah! for an April day, Its cloud, its sparkle, its skip and stay! I mean to be happy whenever I may, And cry when I must; for that 's my way. Would n't you Do it, too, If you had been born on an April day? KITTY. âCome, Kitty, come!â they said,â But Kitty hesitated; Nodding oft her pretty head With, âI 'm coming soon. Father 's rowing home, I know, I cannot think what keeps him so,â And still she stood and waited.â âI'm coming soon.â âCome, Kit!â her brothers cried; But Kitty by the water Still eagerly the distance eyed, With, âI'm coming soon. Why what would evening be,â said she, âWithout dear father home to tea? Without his âHo, my daughter!ââ? I'm coming soon.â âCome, Kate!â her mother called, âThe supper 's almost ready.â But Kitty in her place installed, Pleads: âI'm coming soon. Do let me wait. He 's sure to come; By this time father 's always homeâ He rows so fast and steady; I'm coming soon.â âCome, Kit!â they half implore. The girl is softly humming; She hardly hears them any more,â But âI'm coming soonâ Is in her heart; for far from shoreâ Gliding the happy waters o'erâ She sees the boat, and cries, âHe 's coming! We 're coming soon!â MY WINDOW-IVY. Over my window the ivy climbs, Its roots are in homely jars; But all the day it looks at the sun, And at night looks out at the stars. The dust of the room may dim its green, But I call to the breezy air: âCome in, come in, good friend of mine! And make my window fair.â So the ivy thrives from morn to morn, Its leaves all turned to the light; And it gladdens my soul with its tender green, And teaches me day and night. What though my lot is in lowly place, And my spirit behind the bars; All the long day I may turn to the sun, And at night look out at the stars. What though the dust of earth would dim, There 's a glorious outer air That will sweep through my soul if I let it in, And make it fresh and fair. Dear God! let me grow from day to day, Resolute, sunny, and bright! Though planted in shade, Thy window is near, And my leaves may turn to the light. A BIRTHDAY RHYME. Tell me, O youth so straight and tall, So glad with eager thought! Have you seen of late a bouncing boy Brimful of merry sport? Brimful of merry sport is he, A lad of fifteen summers, With velvet lip still smooth and fair, But a fist that awes all comers. He used to laugh with unconcern Whene'er a school-girl met him, Unconscious quite what wondrous power She 'd have in time to fret him. He only cared for âfellowsâ then, And âball,â and âtag,â and âshinny,â And thought a chap who brushed his hair Was just a fop or ninny. Somehow, I loved this bouncing boy Because he was my own; I had him here a year ago, And know not where he 's flown. I know not where he 's flown, and yet Whenever you are nearâ It 's very odd!âI 'm reconciled Because you grow so dear. You bear great likeness to my boy I think, andâstrange the whim!â There 's that in you which I have prayed Might come in time to him. Then if you'll stay, my dashing youth, And love me like the other, I'll let him go, and, clasping you, Be still a happy mother. So hold me close, my bigger boy, My larger-hearted Harry, With broader shoulders, older head, And more of life to carry; Hold close, and whisper, heart to heart, Our Lord has blessed us truly, Since every year we love so well And find it out so newly. With deepened joy and prayerful love, All in the autumn's splendor, I hail you, boy of mine, and give A welcome proud and tender. 'T is grand to take the birthdays in, If, while the years we 're counting, In heart and soul, in hope and aim, We steadily are mounting. THANKSGIVING. All their heads were bowed in prayer,â Father's, mother's, boys' and girls', Grandma's, grandpa'sâonly Nelly, Little Nelly, shook her curls. Little Nelly shook her curls, Smiling, gazing, all intent, Stared, as ever, at the sightâ Wondered what on earth it meant. Busy fire-light, flashing bright, Shot its frisky flamelets out; While the ship above the clock Gayly tossed and pitched about. Roasted turkey, on his back, And the chickens, side by side, Had a perky, pompous air, Full of jollity and pride; Tempting pies and puddings near, Held their faces to the light; While canary in his cage, Piped and sang with all his might. Flowery carpet under-foot, Hanging basket all a-bloom, Pearly, picture-covered wallâ Drew the sunlight to the room. Little Nelly felt it all, Felt how bright it was and fair; And the moment seemed so long That the heads were bowed in prayer. If they only knew, she thought, How the room was full of play, They would never hide their faces In that sober, solemn way. Laughing, puzzled little Nell! How could such a baby know 'T was the cheery, sunny gladness That had bowed their heads so low; That the blithesome, happy home-life, And the light on hearth and hall, And the laughing âLittle Mischief,â Made them thank the God of all. THERE'S A SHIP ON THE SEA. There's a ship on the sea. It is sailing to-night, Sailing to-night! And father 's aboard, and the moon is all bright, Shining and bright! Dear moon! he'll be sailing for many a nightâ Sailing from mother and me. Oh! follow the ship with your silvery light, As father sails over the sea! AN OFFERTORY. Oh, the beauty of the Christ-child! The gentleness, the grace, The smiling, loving tenderness, The infantile embrace! All babyhood he holdeth, All motherhood enfoldeth,â Yet who hath seen his face? Oh, the nearness of the Christ-child, When, for a sacred space, He nestles in our very homes,â Light of the human race! We know him and we love him, No man to us need prove him,â Yet who hath seen his face? THE BLOOM OF THE CHRISTMAS TREE. At night we planted the Christmas tree In the pretty home, all secretly; All secretly, though merry of heart, With many a whisper, many a start. (For children who 'd scorn to make believe May not sleep soundly on Christmas Eve.) And then the tree began to bloom, Filling with beauty the conscious room. The branches curved in a perfect poise, Laden with wonders that men call âtoys,â Blooming and ripening (and still no noise), Until we merry folk stole away To rest and dream till dawn of day. In the morning the world was a girl and a boy, The universe only their shouts of joy, Till every branch and bough had bent To yield the treasure the Christ-child sent. And thenâand thenâthe children flew Into our arms, as children do, And whispered, over and over again, That oldest, newest, sweetest refrain, âI love you! I love you! Yes, I love you!â And hugged and scrambled, as children do. And we said in our hearts, all secretly: âThis is the bloom of the Christmas tree!â OLD SONGS. Alone in the twilight tender, I plan the coming days, While the supple flames are lapping In weird, fantastic ways; When out of the startled darkness There springs a single note,â And the first light strains of a prelude Slow into the silence float. 'T is Mother's touch! How quietly she always enters in! With child-like throb I listen now to hear the song begin: âRoy's wife of Aldivalloch!â Ah, me! The woful shame! And âhow she cheated himâ I learn with honest ire and blame. And then a moment's silence, a fallen music-pageâ And gone all thought of cruel wife and sorry lover's rage. The shadowy parlor-walls grow wide and change to meadows fair, For the sweet âBluebells of Scotlandâ are waving in the air. The summer sky is over them, the fragrant breezes blow, But, ere they fade, the voice begins in cadence sad and slow. âWhat's this dull town to me?â it sings. âAh, what indeed,â I sigh,â For âRobin is not hereâ it sobs, in plaintive, broken cry. Poor, lonely lassie! weeping sore. My heart is with her still, When suddenly, in changeful mood, there comes a martial thrill; And now I know that through the land one burst of fervor rings, As âWho'll be king but Charlie?â the sweet voice faintly sings. Ah, good it is to listen here, in flitting shadows hid!â Till comes a silken rustle; and then with folded lid The old piano silent stands,âand the wide hall's swinging light Reveals the tall, retreating form, framed in the doorway bright. Only a moment. Vanished now the softly-kerchiefed gown; And once again, the firelight chasing shadows up and down, Is all I see, as thoughtfully I lift the warm brass tongs, And turn the embers over to the echoes of old songs.</field>
