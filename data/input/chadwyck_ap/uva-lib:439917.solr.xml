      <field name="fulltext">POEMS PRELUDE I dreamed one night that the calm hosts of heaven Had lost their changeless paths; and as I stood Beside the latticed window, I could watch Those strange, fair pilgrims wandering from their shrines. Up to the zenith rose the moon, and paused; Stars went and came, and waxed and waned again, Then vanished into nothing; meteors pale Stole, soft as wind-blown blossoms, down the night; Till I awoke to find the cold gray morn Hymning its lonely dirges through the pines. Were it not better that the planets fail, And every heavenly orbit wander wide, Than that this human life, its years like stars, Should miss the accustomed sequence of content? All times are good; life's morning let us sing, Its sunny noon, high noon, the whole world's pause, Nor less that sweet decline which ends in eve. Life were monotonous with its morning hours, Came not the hurrying years to shift our mood, Unfold an altered heaven and spread its glow O'er the changed landscape of time's afternoon. THE TRUMPETER I blew, I blew, the trumpet loudly sounding; I blew, I blew, the heart within me bounding; The world was fresh and fair, yet dark with wrong, And men stood forth to conquer at the song I blew, I blew, I blew. The field is won; the minstrels loud are crying, And all the world is peace; and I am dying. Yet this forgotten life was not in vain; Enough if I alone recall the strain I blew, I blew, I blew. SONNET TO DUTY ???? ??? ???? ?? ????. Euripides (Fragm.). Light of dim mornings; shield from heat and cold; Balm for all ailments; substitute for praise; Comrade of those who plod in lonely ways (Ways that grow lonelier as the years wax old); Tonic for fears; check to the over-bold; Nurse, whose calm hand its strong restriction lays, Kind but resistless, on our wayward days; Mart, where high wisdom at vast price is sold; Gardener, whose touch bids the rose-petals fall, The thorns endure; surgeon, who human hearts Searchest with probes, though the death-wound be given; Spell that knits friends, but yearning lovers parts; Tyrant relentless o'er our blisses all;— Oh, can it be, thine other name is Heaven? A JAR OF ROSE-LEAVES Myriad roses fade unheeded, Yet no note of grief is needed; When the ruder breezes tear them, Sung or songless, we can spare them. But the choicest petals are Shrined in some deep Orient jar, Rich without and sweet within, Where we cast the rose-leaves in. Life has jars of costlier price Framed to hold our memories. There we treasure baby smiles, Boyish exploits, girlish wiles, All that made our early days Sweeter than these trodden ways Where the Fates our fortunes spin. Memory, toss the rose-leaves in! What the jar holds, that shall stay; Time steals all the rest away. Cast in love's first stolen word, Bliss when uttered, bliss when heard; Maiden's looks of shy surprise; Glances from a hero's eyes; Palms we risked our souls to win: Memory, fling the rose-leaves in! Now more sombre and more slow Let the incantation grow! Cast in shreds of rapture brief, Subtle links 'twixt hope and grief; Vagrant fancy's dangerous toys; Covert dreams, narcotic joys Flavored with the taste of sin: Memory, pour the rose-leaves in! Quit that borderland of pain! Cast in thoughts of nobler vein, Magic gifts of human breath, Mysteries of birth and death. What if all this web of change But prepare for scenes more strange; If to die be to begin? Memory, heap the rose-leaves in! SUB PONDERE CRESCIT Can this be he, whose morning footstep trod O'er the green earth as in a regal home? Whose voice rang out beneath the skyey dome Like the high utterance of a youthful god? Now with wan looks and eyes that seek the sod, Restless and purposeless as ocean foam, Across the twilight fields I see him roam With shoulders bowed, as shrinking from the rod. Oh lift the old-time light within thine eyes! Set free the pristine passion from thy tongue! Strength grows with burdens; make an end of sighs. Let thy thoughts soar again their mates among, And as yon oriole's eager matins rise, Abroad once more be thy strong anthem flung! THE BABY SORCERESS Our baby sits beneath the tall elm-trees, A wreath of tangled ribbons in her hands; She twines and twists the many-colored strands, A little sorceress, weaving destinies. Now the pure white she grasps; now naught can please But strips of crimson, lurid as the brands From passion's fires, or yellow, like the sands That lend soft setting to the azure seas. And so with sweet incessant toil she fills A summer hour, still following fancies new, Till through my heart a sudden terror thrills Lest, as she weaves, her aimless choice prove true. Thank God, our fates proceed not from our wills! The Power that spins the thread shall blend the hue. HEIRS OF TIME INSCRIBED TO EDWARD BELLAMY “Aucun homme ne peut aliéner sa souveraineté, parcequ'il ne peut abdiquer sa nature ou cesser d' être homme; et de la souveraineté de chauque individu naît, dans la société, la souveraineté collective de tous ou la souveraineté du peuple, également inaliénable.”— Abbe de la Mennais, Le Livre du Peuple (1837). From street and square, from hill and glen Of this vast world beyond my door, I hear the tread of marching men, The patient armies of the poor. The halo of the city's lamps Hangs, a vast torchlight, in the air; I watch it through the evening damps: The masters of the world are there. Not ermine-clad or clothed in state, Their title-deeds not yet made plain; But waking early, toiling late, The heirs of all the earth remain. Some day, by laws as fixed and fair As guide the planets in their sweep, The children of each outcast heir The harvest-fruits of time shall reap. The peasant brain shall yet be wise, The untamed pulse grow calm and still; The blind shall see, the lowly rise, And work in peace Time's wondrous will. Some day, without a trumpet's call, This news will o'er the world be blown: “The heritage comes back to all! The myriad monarchs take their own!” SIXTY AND SIX: OR A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH “Fons, delicium domus.” Martial. Joy of the morning, Darling of dawning, Blithe little, lithe little daughter of mine! While with thee ranging Sure I'm exchanging Sixty of my years for six years like thine. Wings cannot vie with thee, Lightly I fly with thee Gay as the thistle-down over the lea. Life is all magic, Comic or tragic, Played as thou playest it daily with me. Floating and ringing, Thy merry singing Comes when the light comes, like that of the birds. List to the play of it! That is the way of it; All 's in the music and naught in the words. Glad or grief-laden, Schubert or Haydn, Ballad of Erin or merry Scotch lay; Like an evangel, Some baby-angel Brought from sky-nursery stealing away. Surely I know it, Artist nor poet Guesses my treasure of jubilant hours. Sorrows, what are they? Nearer or far, they Vanish in sunshine, like dew from the flowers. Years, I am glad of them; Would that I had of them More and yet more, while thus mingled with thine. Age, I make light of it, Fear not the sight of it, Time 's but our playmate, whose toys are divine. “SINCE CLEOPATRA DIED” “Since Cleopatra died, I have lived in such dishonor that the gods Detest my baseness.” “Since Cleopatra died!” Long years are past, In Antony's fancy, since the deed was done. Love counts its epochs, not from sun to sun, But by the heart-throb. Mercilessly fast Time has swept onward since she looked her last On life, a queen. For him the sands have run Whole ages through their glass, and kings have won And lost their empires o'er earth's surface vast Since Cleopatra died. Ah! Love and Pain Make their own measure of all things that be. No clock's slow ticking marks their deathless strain; The life they own is not the life we see; Love's single moment is eternity: Eternity, a thought in Shakespeare's brain. THE SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY Over the field where the brown quails whistle, Over the ferns where the rabbits lie, Floats the tremulous down of a thistle. Is it the soul of a butterfly? See! how they scatter and then assemble; Filling the air while the blossoms fade,— Delicate atoms, that whirl and tremble In the slanting sunlight that skirts the glade. There goes the summer's inconstant lover, Drifting and wandering, faint and far; Only bewailed by the upland plover, Watched by only the twilight star. Come next August, when thistles blossom, See how each is alive with wings! Butterflies seek their souls in its bosom, Changed thenceforth to immortal things. DECORATION “Manibus O date lilia plenis.” Mid the flower-wreathed tombs I stand Bearing lilies in my hand. Comrades! in what soldier-grave Sleeps the bravest of the brave? Is it he who sank to rest With his colors round his breast? Friendship makes his tomb a shrine; Garlands veil it: ask not mine. One low grave, yon trees beneath, Bears no roses, wears no wreath; Yet no heart more high and warm Ever dared the battle-storm, Never gleamed a prouder eye In the front of victory, Never foot had firmer tread On the field where hope lay dead, Than are hid within this tomb Where the untended grasses bloom, And no stone, with feigned distress, Mocks the sacred loneliness. Youth and beauty, dauntless will, Dreams that life could ne'er fulfil, Here lie buried; here in peace Wrongs and woes have found release. Turning from my comrades' eyes, Kneeling where a woman lies, I strew lilies on the grave Of the bravest of the brave. “THE SNOWING OF THE PINES” Softer than silence, stiller than still air, Float down from high pine boughs the slender leaves. The forest floor its annual boon receives That comes like snowfall, tireless, tranquil, fair. Gently they glide, gently they clothe the bare Old rocks with grace. Their fall a mantle weaves Of paler yellow than autumnal sheaves Or those strange blossoms the witch-hazels wear. Athwart long aisles the sunbeams pierce their way; High up, the crows are gathering for the night; The delicate needles fill the air; the jay Takes through their golden mist his radiant flight; They fall and fall, till at November's close The snowflakes drop as lightly—snows on snows. THE LESSON OF THE LEAVES O thou who bearest on thy thoughtful face The wearied calm that follows after grief, See how the autumn guides each loosened leaf To sure repose in its own sheltered place. Ah, not forever whirl they in the race Of wild forlornness round the gathered sheaf, Or hurrying onward in a rapture brief Spin o'er the moorlands into trackless space. Some hollow captures each; some sheltering wall Arrests the wanderer on its aimless way; The autumn's pensive beauty needs them all, And winter finds them warm, though sere and gray. They nurse young blossoms for the spring's sweet call, And shield new leaflets for the burst of May. VESTIS ANGELICA [Set to music by Francis Boott, Esq.] It was a custom of the early English church for pious laymen to be carried in the hour of death to some monastery, that they might be clothed in the habit of the religious order, and might die amid the prayers of the brotherhood. The garment thus assumed was known as the Vestis Angelica. See Moroni, Dizionario di Erudizione Storico-Ecclesiastica, ii. 78; xcvi. 212. O gather, gather! Stand Round her on either hand! O shining angel-band More pure than priest! A garment white and whole Weave for this passing soul, Whose earthly joy and dole Have almost ceased. Weave it of mothers' prayers, Of sacred thoughts and cares, Of peace beneath gray hairs, Of hallowed pain; Weave it of vanished tears, Of childlike hopes and fears, Of joys, by saintly years Washed free from stain. Weave it of happy hours, Of smiles and summer flowers, Of passing sunlit showers, Of acts of love; Of footsteps that did go Amid life's work and woe,— Her eyes still fixed below, Her thoughts above. Then as those eyes grow dim Chant we her best-loved hymn, While from yon church-tower's brim A soft chime swells. Her freed soul floats in bliss To unseen worlds from this, Nor knows in which it is She hears the bells. TO MY SHADOW A mute companion at my side Paces and plods, the whole day long, Accepts the measure of my stride, Yet gives no cheer by word or song. More close than any doggish friend, Not ranging far and wide, like him, He goes where'er my footsteps tend, Nor shrinks for fear of life or limb. I do not know when first we met, But till each day's bright hours are done This grave and speechless silhouette Keeps me betwixt him and the sun. They say he knew me when a child; Born with my birth, he dies with me; Not once from his long task beguiled, Though sin or shame bid others flee. What if, when all this world of men Shall melt and fade and pass away, This deathless sprite should rise again And be himself my Judgment Day? TWO VOYAGERS When first I mark upon my child's clear brow Thought's wrestling shadows their new struggle keep, Read my own conflicts in her questions deep, My own remorse in her repentant vow, My own vast ignorance in her “Why?” and “How?” When my precautions only serve to heap New burdens, and my cares her needs o'er-leap, Then to her separate destiny I bow. So seem we like two ships, that side by side, Older and younger, breast the same rough main Bound for one port, whatever winds betide, In solemn interchange of joy or pain. I may not hold thee back. Though skies be dark, Put forth upon the seas, O priceless bark! SEA-GULLS AT FRESH POND O lake of boyish dreams! I linger round Thy calm, clear waters and thine altered shores Till thought brings back the plash of childhood's oars,— Long hid in memory's depths, a vanished sound. Alone unchanged, the sea-birds yet are found Far floating on thy wave by threes and fours, Or grouped in hundreds, while a white gull soars, Safe, beyond gunshot of the hostile ground. I am no nearer to those joyous birds Than when, long since, I watched them as a child; Nor am I nearer to that flock more wild, Most shy and vague of all elusive things, My unattainable thoughts, unreached by words. I see the flight, but never touch the wings. THE DYING HOUSE She is dead; her house is dying; Round its long-deserted door, From the hillside and the moor, Swell the autumn breezes sighing. Closer to its windows press Pine-tree boughs in mute caress; Wind-sown seeds in silence come, Root, and grow, and bud, and bloom; Year by year, kind Nature's grace Wraps and shields her dwelling-place. She who loved all things that grew, Talked with every bird that flew, Brought each creature to her feet With persuasive accents sweet,— Now her voice is hushed and gone, Yet the birds and bees keep on. Oh the joy, the love, the glee, Sheltered once by that roof-tree! Song and dance and serenade, Joyous jest by maskers played; Passionate whispers on the stairs, Hopes unspoken, voiceless prayers; Greetings that repressed love's theme, Partings that renewed its dream; All the blisses, all the woes, Youth's brief hour of springtime knows,— All have died into the past. Perish too the house at last! Vagrant children come and go 'Neath the windows, murmuring low; Peering with impatient eye For a ghostly mystery. Some a fabled secret tell, Others touch the soundless bell, Then with hurrying step retreat From the echo of their feet. Or perchance there wander near Guests who once held revel here: Some live o'er again the days Of their love's first stolen gaze; Or some sad soul, looking in, Calls back hours of blight or sin, Glad if her mute life may share In the sheltering silence there. Oh, what cheeks might blanch with fears, Had walls tongues, as they have ears! Silent house with close-locked doors, Ghosts and memories haunt thy floors! Not a web of circumstance Woven here into romance E'er can perish; many a thread Must survive when thou art dead. Children's children shall not know How their doom of joy or woe Was determined ere their birth, 'Neath this roof that droops to earth, By some love-tie here create, Or hereditary hate, Or some glance whose bliss or strife Was the climax of a life, Though its last dumb witness falls With the crumbling of these walls. A SONG OF DAYS O radiant summer day, Whose air, sweet air, steals on from flower to flower! Couldst thou not yield one hour When the glad heart says, “This alone is May”? O passionate earthly love, Whose tremulous pulse beats on to life's best boon! Couldst thou not give one noon, One noon of noons, all other bliss above? O solemn human life, Whose nobler longings bid all conflict cease! Grant us one day's deep peace Beyond the utmost rumor of all strife. For if no joy can stay, Let it at least yield one consummate bloom, Or else there is no room To find delight in love, or life, or May. BENEATH THE VIOLETS Safe 'neath the violets Rests the baby form; Every leaf that springtime sets Shields it from the storm. Peace to all vain regrets Mid this sunshine warm! Shadows come and shadows go O'er the meadows wide; Twice each day, to and fro, Steals the river-tide; Each morn with sunrise-glow Gilds the green hillside. Peace that no sorrow frets In our souls arise! Over all our wild regrets Arching, like the skies; While safe 'neath the violets Sleep the violet eyes. “THE KNOCK ALPHABET” [Mr. Kennan tells us that Russian prisoners converse with each other in a complex alphabet, indicated by knocking on the walls of their cells.] Like prisoners, each within his own deep cell, We mortals talk together through a wall. “Was that low note indeed my brother's call? Or but a distant water-drop which fell?” Yet to the straining ear each sound can tell Some woe that might the bravest heart appal, Or some high hope that triumphs over all: “Brother, I die to-morrow.” “Peace!” “All 's well!” Oh, could we once see fully, face to face, But one of these our mates,—once speak aloud, Once meet him, heart to heart, in strong embrace,— How would our days be glad, our hopes be proud! Perchance that wall is Life; and life being done, Death may unite these sundered cells in one. THE REED IMMORTAL INSCRIBED TO THE BOSTON PAPYRUS CLUB [Pliny tells us that the Egyptians regarded the papyrus as an emblem of immortality.] Reed of the stagnant waters, Far in the Eastern lands, Rearing thy peaceful daughters In sight of the storied sands! Armies and fleets defying Have swept by that quiet spot, But thine is the life undying, Theirs is the tale forgot. The legions of Alexander Are scattered and gone and fled, And the queen who ruled commander Over Antony is dead; The marching armies of Cyrus Have vanished in earth again, And only the frail papyrus Still reigns o'er the sons of men. Papyrus! O reed immortal, Survivor of all renown! Thou heed'st not the solemn portal Where heroes and kings go down. The monarchs of generations Have died into dust away; O reed that outlivest nations, Be our symbol of strength to-day! DAME CRAIGIE [Lines read at the Longfellow Memorial Reading, Cambridge, February 27, 1888.] In childish Cambridge days, now long ago, When pacing schoolward in the morning hours, I passed the stately homes of Tory Row And paused to see Dame Craigie tend her flowers. Framed in the elm-tree boughs before her door The old escutcheon of our town was seen,— Canker-worms pendent, yellowing leaves in or, School-boys regardant, on a field grass-green. Dame Craigie, with Spinoza in her hand, Was once heard murmuring to the insect crew, “I will not harm you, little restless band! For what are mortal men but worms, like you?” The trees are gone: Dame Craigie too is gone, Her tongue long silent, and her turban furled; Yet 'neath her roof thought's silk-worms still spun on, Whose sumptuous fabric clothed a barren world. DWELLING-PLACES Where is thy home, O little fair head, With thy sunny hair, on earth's clouded way? “On my lover's breast; and I take my rest, And I know no terror by night or day.” Where is thy home, O little fair heart, With thy joyous hopes in life's shadows dim? “In my lover's heart; and we never part, For he carries me round the world with him.” Where is thy home, O little fair soul, So brave 'mid the old world's sorrow and care? “My home is in heaven. To me 't is given To win my lover to meet me there.” TO THE MEMORY OF H. H. O soul of fire within a woman's clay! Lifting with slender hands a race's wrong, Whose mute appeal hushed all thine early song, And taught thy passionate heart the loftier way,— What shall thy place be in the realm of day? What disembodied world can hold thee long, Binding thy turbulent pulse with spell more strong? Dwell'st thou, with wit and jest, where poets may, Or with ethereal women—born of air And poet's dreams—dost live in ecstasy, Teach new love-thoughts to Shakespeare's Juliet fair, New moods to Cleopatra? Then, set free, The woes of Shelley's Helen thou dost share, Or weep with poor Rossetti's Rose Mary. VENUS MULTIFORMIS Three men on a broken deck-plank, With the reef and its roar ahead, Floated on, through a fair June morning, To a doom that was sure and dread. Said one, “My years have been wasted On a woman's terrible charms; But oh! to see death draw near me, And to die outside of her arms!” Said another, “Through surge and through tempest My eyes are fixed on her face; I forget the tumult of ocean In the joy of her last embrace.” Said the third, “I can die unflinching Wherever my fortune lies; But oh! her endless bereavement, And the rivers of tears from her eyes!” While the woman they all had worshipped Walked out from the gray church-door Amid smiles and greetings and music, And followed by prayers of the poor. TO JOHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER At dawn of manhood came a voice to me That said to startled conscience, “Sleep no more!” Like some loud cry that peals from door to door It roused a generation; and I see, Now looking back through years of memory, That all of school or college, all the lore Of worldly maxims, all the statesman's store, Were naught beside that voice's mastery. If any good to me or from me came Through life, and if no influence less divine Has quite usurped the place of duty's flame; If aught rose worthy in this heart of mine, Aught that, viewed backward, wears no shade of shame,— Bless thee, old friend! for that high call was thine. Cambridge, December 17, 1887. WAITING FOR THE BUGLE [Read before the Grand Army Post (56) of veteran soldiers, at Cambridge, Mass., May 25, 1888. Set to music by Francis Boott, Esq.] We wait for the bugle; the night-dews are cold, The limbs of the soldiers feel jaded and old, The field of our bivouac is windy and bare, There is lead in our joints, there is frost in our hair, The future is veiled and its fortunes unknown, As we lie with hushed breath till the bugle is blown. At the sound of that bugle each comrade shall spring Like an arrow released from the strain of the string; The courage, the impulse of youth shall come back To banish the chill of the drear bivouac, And sorrows and losses and cares fade away When that life-giving signal proclaims the new day. Though the bivouac of age may put ice in our veins, And no fibre of steel in our sinew remains; Though the comrades of yesterday's march are not here, And the sunlight seems pale and the branches are sere,— Though the sound of our cheering dies down to a moan, We shall find our lost youth when the bugle is blown. ASTRA CASTRA Somewhere betwixt me and the farthest star, Or else beyond all worlds, all space, all thought, Dwells that freed spirit, now transformed and taught To move in orbits where the immortals are. Does she rejoice or mourn? Perchance from far Some earthly errand she but now has sought, By instantaneous ways among us brought, Ways to which night and distance yield no bar. Could we but reach and touch that wayward will On earth so hard to touch, would she be found Controlled or yet impetuous, free or bound, Tameless as ocean, or serene and still? If in her heart one eager impulse stirs, Could heaven itself calm that wild mood of hers? MEMORIAL ODE [Read before the Grand Army Posts of Boston, Mass., on Memorial Day, May 30, 1881, by Mr. George Riddle.] I. Joy to the three-hilled city!—for each year Heals something of the grief this day records; Each year the plaintive lay Sounds yet more far away, And strains of triumph suit memorial words. The old-time pang becomes a thrill of joy; Again we turn the page Of our heroic age, And read anew the tale of every patriot boy. A modest courage was their simple wont, The dauntless youths who grew to manhood here: Putnam and Savage, Perkins and Revere. It needs no helmet's gleam, No armor's glittering beam, No feudal imagery of shield or spear To gild the gallant deeds that roused us then,— When Cass fell dying in the battle's front, And Shaw's fair head lay 'mid his dusky men. II. All o'er the tranquil land On this Memorial Day, Coming from near and far, Men gather in the mimic guise of war. They bear no polished steel, Yet by the elbow's touch they march, they wheel, Or side by side they stand. They now are peaceful men, fair Order's sons; But as they halt in motionless array, Or bow their heads to pray, Into their dream intrudes The swift sharp crack of rifle-shots in woods; Into their memory swells The trumpet's call, the screaming of the shells; And ever and anon they seem to hear The far-off thunder of besieging guns,— All sounds of bygone war, all memories of the ear. III. A little while it seems Since those were daily thoughts which now are dreams. A little while is gone Since, the last battle fought, the victory won, We saw sweet Peace come back with all her charms, And watched a million men lay down their arms. But at this morning's call We bridge the interval; And yet once more, with no regretful tears, Live back again, though now men's blood be cooled, Through the long vista of the fading years To days when Sumner spoke, and Andrew ruled. IV. Courage is first and last of what we need To mould a nation for triumphal sway: All else is empty air, A promise vainly fair, Like the bright beauty of the ocean spray Tossed up toward heaven, but never reaching there. Not in the past, but in the future, we Must seek the mastery Of fate and fortune, thought and word and deed. Gone, gone for aye, the little Puritan homes; Gone the beleaguered town, from out whose spires Flashed forth the warning fires Telling the Cambridge rustics, “Percy comes!” And gone those later days of grief and shame When slavery changed our court-house to a jail, And blood-drops stained its threshold. Now we hail, After the long affray, A time of calmer order, wider aim, More mingled races, manhood's larger frame, A city's broader sweep, the Boston of to-day. V. They say our city's star begins to wane, Our heroes pass away, our poets die, Our passionate ardors mount no more so high. 'T is but an old alarm, the affright of wealth, The cowardice of culture, wasted pain! Freedom is hope and health! The sea on which yon ocean steamers ride Is the same sea that rocked the shallops frail Of the bold Pilgrims; yonder is its tide, And here are we, their sons; it grows not pale, Nor we who walk its borders. Never fear! Courage and truth are all! Trust in the great hereafter, and whene'er In some high hour of need, That tests the heroic breed, The Boston of the future sounds its call, Bartletts and Lowells yet shall answer, “Here!” SERENADE BY THE SEA [Set to music by M. Albert Pégou.] O'er the ocean vague and wide Sleep comes with the coming tide. Breezes lull my lady fair, Cool her eyelids, soothe her hair, While the murmuring surges seem To float her through a world of dream. Shadowy sloops are gliding in Safe the harbor-bar within. Silently each phantom pale Drops the anchor, furls the sail. She, meanwhile, remote from me Drifts on sleep's unfathomed sea. So may every dream of ill Find its anchorage, and be still; Sorrow furl its sails and cease In this midnight realm of peace; And each wandering thought find rest In the haven of her breast. THE THINGS I MISS An easy thing, O Power Divine, To thank Thee for these gifts of Thine! For summer's sunshine, winter's snow, For hearts that kindle, thoughts that glow. But when shall I attain to this,— To thank Thee for the things I miss? For all young Fancy's early gleams, The dreamed-of joys that still are dreams, Hopes unfulfilled, and pleasures known Through others' fortunes, not my own, And blessings seen that are not given, And never will be, this side heaven. Had I too shared the joys I see, Would there have been a heaven for me? Could I have felt Thy presence near, Had I possessed what I held dear? My deepest fortune, highest bliss, Have grown perchance from things I miss. Sometimes there comes an hour of calm; Grief turns to blessing, pain to balm; A Power that works above my will Still leads me onward, upward still. And then my heart attains to this,— To thank Thee for the things I miss. 1870. AN EGYPTIAN BANQUET A crowded life, where joy perennial starts; The boy's pulse beating 'mid experience sage; Wild thirst for action, time could ne'er assuage; Countless sad secrets, learned from weary hearts; New thresholds gained, as each full hour departs; Long years read singly, each an opened page; Love's blissful dreams and friendship's priceless gage; A name grown famous through the streets and marts; Knowledge advancing; thoughts that climb and climb; Aims that expand; new pinions that unfurl; Age that outstrips all promise of its prime; Hopes which their prayers at utmost heaven hurl,— Till in an instant, in a point of time, Death, the Egyptian, melts and drinks the pearl. AN AMERICAN STONEHENGE Far up on these abandoned mountain farms Now drifting back to forest wilds again, The long, gray walls extend their clasping arms, Pathetic monuments of vanished men. Serpents in stone, they wind o'er hill and dell 'Mid orchards long deserted, fields unshorn,— The crumbling fragments resting where they fell Forgotten, worthless to a race new-born. Nearer than stones of storied Saxon name These speechless relics to our hearts should come. No toiler for a priest's or monarch's fame, This farmer lived and died to shape a home. What days of lonely toil he undertook! What years of iron labor! and for what? To yield the chipmunk one more secret nook, The gliding snake one more sequestered spot. So little time on earth; so much to do; Yet all that waste of weary, toil-worn hands! Life came and went; the patient task is through; The men are gone; the idle structure stands. THE HORIZON LINE We wander wide o'er earth's remotest lands, Yet never reach those wondrous realms that are Bounded in childhood by thy shadowy bar, That 'twixt us and our fortunes ever stands. Though Cæsar tread the globe with conquering bands He cannot touch thine outline faint and far That flies before him; and the heaven's least star Is not more safe from contact of his hands. O spell forever vague and hovering, Thou offerest endless balm for jaded eyes, Dull with achievement! Man until he dies Thy magic distance can no nearer bring,— Alluring, soft, elusive, still it lies On the vast earth one inaccessible thing. THE FAIRY COURSERS Floating afar upon the lake's calm bosom, Whirled in blissful myriads, dart the dragonflies; Mingled in their mazes with bird and bee and blossom They sink with the rainclouds or on the breezes rise. Little blue phantom around my dory flitting Or poised in peaceful silence on the loom of my oar, Heaven has marked out for thee a labor that is fitting Though eyes dim and human may miss thy secret lore. Fairies that have fled from the grasp of earthly forces, Shielded from the view of us mortals dimly-eyed, These are their chariots, these their wingèd horses, Safe on these coursers the vanished fairies ride. RABIAH'S DEFENCE The tradition may be found in Lyall's Ancient Arabian Poetry, page 56. The measure is an imitation of the Arabic Tawil. Go not away from us; stay, O Rabiah, son of Mukàd! Soft may the clouds of dawn spread dew on thy grassy grave, Rabiah, the long-locked boy, who guardedst thy women, dead. Fast rode the fleeing band, straight for the pass al-Khadìd, Mother and daughters, wives, and Rabiah the only man, Fleeing for honor and life through lands of a vengeful tribe. Sudden a moving cloud came swift o'er the hill behind. Dark rode the men of Sulaim, and Death rode dark in their midst. “Save us!” the mother cried. “O boy, thou must fight alone!” “Hasten, ride!” he said, calm. “I only draw rein till a wind Blowing this dust away gives place to look for the foe.” His sisters moaned, “He deserts!” “Have you known it?” Rabiah cried. The women rode and rode. When the dust cleared, his arrows sprang Straight at the following foe: the pride of their host went down. Swift turned Rabiah his mare, and o'ertook his retreating kin, Halted and faced again as the men of Sulaim closed round. Ever his mother called: “Charge thou once more, O son! Keep off their hands from us all; meet them with shaft on shaft.” Still he kept facing, and aimed till every arrow was gone; Still rode the women on,—by sunset the pass was near. Still the black horses came, and Rabiah drew his sword, Checked for the last time there, and face to face with a clan. Then rode Nubaishah up, son of the old Habìb, Thrust young Rabiah through, and cried aloud, “He is slain! Look at the blood on my lance!” Said Rabiah only, “A lie!” Turned and galloped once more, and faced when he reached al-Khadìd. There had the women paused, to enter the pass one by one. “Mother,” he cried, “give me drink!” She answered, “Drink, thou art dead, Leaving thy women slaves. First save thou thy women, then die!” “Bind up my wound,” he said; she bound with her veil. He sang, “I was a hawk that drove the tumult of frightened birds, Diving deep with my blows, before and again behind.” Then she said, “Smite again!” and he, where the pass turns in, Sat upright on his steed, barring the road once more. Then drew the death-chill on; he leaned his head on his spear, Dim in the twilight there, with the shadows darkening down. Never a dog of Sulaim came up, but they watched and watched. The mare moved never a hoof; the rider was still as she; Till sudden Nubaishah shrieked, “His head droops down on his neck! He is dead, I tell you, dead! Shoot one true shaft at his mare!” The mare started, she sprang; and Rabiah fell, stone cold. Far and away through the pass the women were safe in their homes. Then up rode a man of Sulaim, struck Rabiah hard with his spear, Saying, “Thou Pride of God, thou alone of mortals wast brave. Never a man of our tribe but would for his women die; Never before lived one who guarded them yet, though dead!” THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE A winged sunbeam flashes through the trees And whistles thrice, as if the air took voice And all the embodied springtime cried, “Rejoice!” The jocund notes enchant the morning breeze, Now here, now there, still shifting as they please,— “O fear not! all is well since I am here.” The blind, the imprisoned, know that cry of cheer, And grief must yield to joy's blithe litanies. A myriad blossoms cluster round his feet, And all the air is full of heaven-sent things. Hark! once again the jubilant treble rings, Swift as that hurrying flight, though wild and sweet. What room is left for meanness or deceit Or fear, in planets where the oriole sings? THE SLEEPING-CAR Cælum non animum mutant. We lie with senses lulled and still 'Twixt dream and thought, 'twixt night and day, While smoke and steam their office fill To bear our prostrate forms away. The stars, the clouds, the mountains, all Glide by us through the midnight deep; The names of slumbering cities fall Like feathers from the wings of sleep. Till at the last, in morning light, Beneath an alien sky we stand; Vast spaces traversed in a night; Another clime, another land. NEMESIS The stern processional ascends the steep Of high Olympus, and the kings of song With ceaseless note the antiphony prolong Of those who robe in sackcloth. Sad and deep Their voices who the unchecked remembrance keep Of wandering passion. Fearlessly and strong Did Shakespeare wail the expense of spirit's wrong, And Burns the woe that poppied pleasures reap. Easier for human hearts to bear a pain Than to forego the rapture that they miss. Men may repent, but how can they forget? Sin's retribution dwells in longings vain,— Not in remorse, but in the wild regret And helpless yearning for disastrous bliss. MAB'S PONIES Far off among our pine-clad hills, When night is on the forest glade, Amid the shadowy rocks and rills There roams a tinkling cavalcade. We sometimes hear, half waked from sleep, A nearer hoof, a phantom neigh, Till breezes from Monadnock sweep And bear the magic sounds away. Their home is in the dusky woods; Their tramp is on the midnight sod; No eye descries their solitudes, The uplands where their feet have trod. Above the works of farmers dead, Their fields untilled, their harvests gone, Romance resumes its airy tread Within the haunts of Oberon. THE MONK OF LA TRAPPE That silent man, who gazes on the waves, Clad in the garb which severs him from life And bars all hope of home or child or wife, Once knew the bliss that thrills, the grief that raves. Kings were his friends, and queens his meek-voiced slaves. Each crowded day with passionate impulse rife, He tasted hope, fear, anguish, longing, strife; Remorse that hates, yet seeks, condemns, yet craves. Perhaps some dream, as sinks yon evening sun, Leads back the dramas of his stormy prime,— Beauty embraced, foes quelled, ambitions won,— A tangled web of courage and of crime. Those years, long wholly vanished, throb for him Like pangs which haunt the amputated limb. ODE TO A BUTTERFLY Thou spark of life that wavest wings of gold, Thou songless wanderer 'mid the songful birds, With Nature's secrets in thy tints unrolled Through gorgeous cipher, past the reach of words, Yet dear to every child In glad pursuit beguiled, Living his unspoiled days 'mid flowers and flocks and herds! Thou wingèd blossom, liberated thing, What secret tie binds thee to other flowers, Still held within the garden's fostering? Will they too soar with the completed hours, Take flight, and be like thee Irrevocably free, Hovering at will o'er their parental bowers? Or is thy lustre drawn from heavenly hues,— A sumptuous drifting fragment of the sky, Caught when the sunset its last glance imbues With sudden splendor, and the treetops high Grasp that swift blazonry, Then lend those tints to thee, On thee to float a few short hours, and die? Birds have their nests; they rear their eager young, And flit on errands all the livelong day; Each field-mouse keeps the homestead whence it sprung; But thou art Nature's freeman,—free to stray Unfettered through the wood Seeking thine airy food, The sweetness spiced on every blossomed spray. The garden one wide banquet spreads for thee, O daintiest reveller of the joyous earth! One drop of honey gives satiety: A second draught would drug thee past all mirth. Thy feast no orgy shows; Thy calm eyes never close, Thou soberest sprite to which the sun gives birth. And yet the soul of man upon thy wings Forever soars in aspiration; thou His emblem of the new career that springs When death's arrest bids all his spirit bow. He seeks his hope in thee Of immortality. Symbol of life, me with such faith endow! THE TWO LESSONS “Disce, puer, virtutem ex me, verumque laborem; Fortunam ex aliis.”— Æneas to Ascanius (Æneid, xii. 435). Learn, boy, from me what dwells in man alone, Courage immortal, and the steadfast sway Of patient toil, that glorifies the day. What most ennobles life is all our own, Yet not the whole of life; the fates atone For what they give by what they keep away. Learn thou from others all the triumphs gay That dwell in sunnier realms, to me unknown. Each soul imparts one lesson; each supplies One priceless secret that it holds within. In your own heart—there only—stands the prize. Foiled of all else, your own career you win. We half command our fates; the rest but lies In that last drop which unknown powers fling in. CROSSED SWORDS My grandsire fought for England, sword in hand; My other grandsire joined in high debate, To free a nation and to mould the State. Within my blood the two commingled stand, Yielding this heart, still true to its own land, A mingled heritage of love and hate. The peevish pens of London cannot prate So coarsely, but I feel the eternal band That binds me, England, to thy low-hung shore, Thy dainty turf, smooth stream, and gentle hill, So alien from our spaces vast and wild. Were England dying, at her cannon's roar, I think my grandsire's sword would stir and thrill, Though when this land lay bleeding, England smiled. AN OUTDOOR KINDERGARTEN O mists that loiter, vague and wild, Along the enchanted stream, Come lend your lesson to my child, And teach her how to dream. O wood-thrush, murmuring tender lays From pine-tree depths above, Make her thy pupil all her days, And teach her how to love. Thou oriole, in thy blithesome chant A fearless counsel give; Thy brave and joyous influence grant, And teach her how to live. And guard her, Nature, till she bears, These forest paths along, A heart more joyous than thine airs, And fresher than thy song. DIRGE A SCOTTISH ECHO Heart of the oak-grain, full of trembling love (Oh and alas-a-day, oh and alas-a-day!), Glad eyes that looked around, within, above, (Ten thousand times good-night, and peace for thee!) Up the long hillside through the moonlit glade (Oh and alas-a-day, oh and alas-a-day!), Serene and pure, thine innocent steps have strayed (Ten thousand times good-night, and love for thee!); But now released at length from life's low glen (Oh and alas-a-day, oh and alas-a-day!), Where shall thy paths be when we meet again? (Ten thousand times good-night, and heaven for thee!) THE MADONNA DI SAN SISTO [These verses, written and published at the age of nineteen, are here preserved, partly from their association with my dear old friend and college teacher, Professor Longfellow, who liked them well enough to include them in his “Estray,” in 1847.] Look down into my heart, Thou holy Mother, with thy holy Son! Read all my thoughts, and bid the doubts depart, And all the fears be done. I lay my spirit bare, O blessèd ones! beneath your wondrous eyes, And not in vain; ye hear my heartfelt prayer, And your twin-gaze replies. What says it? All that life Demands of those who live, to be and do,— Calmness, in all its bitterest, deepest strife; Courage, till all is through. Thou Mother! in thy sight Can aught of passion or despair remain? Beneath those eyes' serene and holy light The soul is bright again. Thou Son! whose earnest gaze Looks ever forward, fearless, steady, strong; Beneath those eyes no doubt or weakness stays, Nor fear can linger long. Thanks, that to my weak heart Your mingled powers, fair forms, such counsel give. Till I have learned the lesson ye impart, I have not learned to live. And oh, till life is done Of your deep gaze may ne'er the impression cease! Still may the dark eyes whisper, “Courage! On!” The mild eyes murmur, “Peace!” POEMS FROM “THALATTA” [The two poems which follow are from a volume called “Thalatta; a book for the Sea-side,” edited by my friend Samuel Longfellow and myself in 1853.] I. CALM. 'T is a dull, sullen day,—the dull beach o'er In rippling curves the ebbing ocean flows; Along each tiny crest that nears the shore A line of soft green shadow rises, glides, and goes. The tide recedes,—the flat smooth beach grows bare, More faint the low sweet plashing on my ears, Yet still I watch the dimpling shadows fair, As each is born, glides, pauses, disappears. What channel needs our faith except the eyes? God leaves no spot of earth unglorified; Profuse and wasteful, lovelinesses rise; New beauties dawn before the old have died. Trust thou thy joys in keeping of the Power Who holds these faint soft shadows in His hand; Believe and live, and know that hour by hour Will ripple newer beauty to thy strand. II. THE MORNING MIST. The mist that like a dim soft pall was lying, Mingling the gray sea with the low gray sky, Floats upward now; the sunny breeze is sighing, And Youth stands pale before his destiny: O passionate heart of Youth! Each rolling wave with herald voice is crying; Thou canst delay, but never shun replying, It calls thee living or it calls thee dying, Though beauty fade before the glare of truth. Thou wanderest onward 'neath the solemn morning, It seems like midday ere the sun rides high, The soft mist fades, whose shadowy adorning Wrapt in a dreamy haze the earth and sky; The Ocean lies before! Oh thou art lost if thou discard the warning To make hot Day more fair than fairest dawning, Till eve look back serenely on the morning When Youth stood trembling on the ocean-shore. THE FEBRUARY HUSH Snow o'er the darkening moorlands,— Flakes fill the quiet air; Drifts in the forest hollows, And a soft mask everywhere. The nearest twig on the pine-tree Looks blue through the whitening sky, And the clinging beech-leaves rustle Though never a wind goes by. But there 's red on the wildrose berries, And red in the lovely glow On the cheeks of the child beside me, That once were pale, like snow. HYMNS [Three of these hymns were written at about the age of twenty-two, and were published anonymously in a collection edited by my friends Samuel Longfellow and Samuel Johnson. They are here inserted mainly because they have secured for themselves a semblance of permanent vitality in hymn-books, and are not always correctly printed. The fourth was an occasional hymn written a year or two later.] I. I WILL ARISE AND GO UNTO MY FATHER. To Thine eternal arms, O God, Take us, Thine erring children, in: From dangerous paths too boldly trod, From wandering thoughts and dreams of sin. Those arms were round our childish ways, A guard through helpless years to be; Oh leave not our maturer days, We still are helpless without Thee! We trusted hope and pride and strength: Our strength proved false, our pride was vain, Our dreams have faded all at length,— We come to Thee, O Lord, again! A guide to trembling steps yet be! Give us of Thine eternal powers! So shall our paths all lead to Thee, And life smile on like childhood's hours. II. THE HOPE OF MAN. The Past is dark with sin and shame, The Future dim with doubt and fear; But, Father, yet we praise Thy name, Whose guardian love is always near. For man has striven, ages long, With faltering steps to come to Thee, And in each purpose high and strong The influence of Thy grace could see. He could not breathe an earnest prayer, But Thou wast kinder than he dreamed, As age by age brought hopes more fair, And nearer still Thy kingdom seemed. But never rose within his breast A trust so calm and deep as now; Shall not the weary find a rest? Father, Preserver, answer Thou! 'T is dark around, 't is dark above, But through the shadow streams the sun; We cannot doubt Thy certain love; And Man's true aim shall yet be won! III. PANTHEISM AND THEISM. No human eyes Thy face may see, No human thought Thy form may know; But all creation dwells in Thee, And Thy great life through all doth flow! And yet, O strange and wondrous thought! Thou art a God who hearest prayer, And every heart with sorrow fraught To seek Thy present aid may dare. And though most weak our efforts seem Into one creed these thoughts to bind, And vain the intellectual dream To see and know the Eternal Mind,— Yet Thou wilt turn them not aside Who cannot solve Thy life divine, But would give up all reason's pride To know their hearts approved by Thine. So, though we faint on life's dark hill, And thought grow weak, and knowledge flee, Yet faith shall teach us courage still, And love shall guide us on to Thee! IV. HYMN SUNG AT THE GRADUATING EXERCISES OF CAMBRIDGE DIVINITY SCHOOL, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, 1847. To veil Thy truth by darkening or by hiding: To stand irresolute or shrink appalled; To deal vague words of customary chiding, Father! to no such work Thy voice has called. Our eyes are dim, yet can we see the duty. Our souls are weak, yet can we shun the wrong. 'T is not in vain that here amid the beauty Of Thy deep teachings we have stayed so long. Some wounds are turned to pearls; some limbs offending We have had strength to seize and rend away; Some passionate earthly songs are changed in ending To choral anthem and triumphant lay. To build 'mid gentle hearts Thy church, the peerless; To speak the truth in love, whate'er befall; To make our brothers humble, tireless, fearless;— This is the work to which Thy spirit calls. Some seeds we sow may blossom into flowers And those yield fruit to ripen 'neath Thy sun, And Thou wilt bear these trembling hearts of ours On to that peace where aim and deed grow one. SAPPHO'S ODE TO APHRODITE ????????????, ??????? ????????. Beautiful-throned, immortal Aphrodite! Daughter of Zeus, beguiler! I implore thee Weigh me not down with weariness and anguish, O thou most holy! Come to me now! if ever thou in kindness Hearkenedst my words,—and often hast thou hearkened, Heeding, and coming from the mansion golden Of thy great Father, Yoking thy chariot, borne by thy most lovely Consecrated birds, with dusky-tinted pinions, Waving swift wings from utmost heights of heaven Through the mid-ether; Swiftly they vanished, leaving thee, O Goddess! Smiling, with face immortal in its beauty, Asking why I grieved, and why in utter longing I had dared call thee; Asking what I sought, thus hopeless in desiring, 'Wildered in brain, and spreading nets of passion— Alas, for whom? and saidst thou, “Who has harmed thee? O my poor Sappho! “Though now he flies, ere long he shall pursue thee; Fearing thy gifts, he too in turn shall bring them; Loveless to-day, to-morrow he shall woo thee, Though thou shouldst spurn him.” Thus seek me now, O holy Aphrodite! Save me from anguish, give me all I ask for,— Gifts at thy hand! And thine shall be the glory, Sacred Protector! FORWARD FROM THE GERMAN OF HOFFMANN VON FALLERSLEBEN It is a time of swell and flood; We linger on the strand, And all that might to us bring good Lies in a distant land. Oh, forward! forward! why stand still? The tide will not run dry; Who in the flood ne'er venture will, That land shall never spy. NATURE'S CRADLE-SONG FROM THE GERMAN OF RÜCKERT “Dreimal mit dem weissen Kleide.” Thrice with winter's whitest snows Has thy mother decked thy bed, Thrice 'mid summer's loveliest glows Twined green garlands o'er thy head, Asking yet uncomforted, “Still thy slumber art thou keeping?” —Thou art still in cradle sleeping. Thrice have come the soft spring showers Where thy quiet form reposes; Thrice have blown the snowdrop flowers, Thrice the violets, thrice the roses, Murmuring oft with sweetest closes, “Still thy soul in slumber steeping?” —Thou art still in cradle sleeping. Thrice three hundred nights and morrows Moon and sun have watched thy dreaming; Now they look with ceaseless sorrows O'er thee once with rapture gleaming; Silent asks their steadfast beaming, “Comes no light through darkness creeping?” —Thou art still in cradle sleeping. Thrice spring zephyrs in their flowing Soft have rocked thee to repose; Thrice rude Boreas, wilder blowing; Every wind thy slumber knows, Striving, while the season goes, Which shall hold thee in his keeping. —Thou art still in cradle sleeping. SONNETS FROM CAMOENS [Mrs. Browning in “Catarina to Camoens” represents her as bequeathing him the ribbon from her hair; but she in reality gave it to him during her life as a substitute for the ringlet for which he pleaded.] (42.) “Lindo e subtil trançado, que ficaste.” O ribbon fair, that dost with me remain In pawn for that sweet gift I do deserve, If but to win thee makes my reason swerve, What were it if one ringlet I could gain? Those golden locks thy circling knots restrain, Locks whose bright rays might well for sunbeams serve, When thou unloosest each fair coil and curve, Oh is it to beguile, or slay with pain? Dear ribbon, in my hand I hold thee now; And were it only to assuage my grief, Since I can have thee only, cling to thee, Yet tell her, thou canst never fill my vow, But in the reckoning of love's fond belief This gift for that whole debt a pledge shall be. “For we had been reading Camoens,—that poem, you remember, Which his lady's eyes were praised in, as the sweetest ever seen.” Elizabeth Barrett Browning. (186.) “Os olhos onde o casto Amor ardia.” Those eyes from whence chaste love was wont to glow, And smiled to see his torches kindled there; That face within whose beauty strange and rare The rosy light of dawn gleamed o'er the snow; That hair, which bid the envious sun to know His brightest beams less golden rays did wear; That pure white hand, that gracious form and fair: All these into the dust of earth must go. O perfect beauty in its tenderest age! O flower cut down ere it could all unfold By the stern hand of unrelenting death! Why did not Love itself quit earth's poor stage, Not because here dwelt beauty's perfect mould, But that so soon it passed from mortal breath?</field>
