      <field name="fulltext">THE ROBIN. Written in New Mexico, on hearing a red-breast sing, the only one that I ever heard there. Hush! where art thou clinging, And what art thou singing, Bird of my own native land? Thy song is as sweet As a fairy's feet Stepping on silver sandâ And thou Art now As merry as though thou wast singing at home, Away In the spray Of a shower, that tumbles through odorous gloom; Or as if thou wast hid, To the tip of thy wing, By a broad oaken leaf In its greenness of spring, And thy nest lurked amid a gray heaven of shade, Where thy young and thyself from the sunshine were laid. Hush! hush!âLook around thee! Lo! bleak mountains bound thee, All barren and gloomy and red; And a desolate pine Doth above thee incline, And gives not a leaf to thy bedâ And lo! Below No flowers of beauty and brilliancy blow, But weeds, Gray heads, That mutter and moan when the wind-waves flow: And the rain never falls In the season of spring, To freshen thy heart And to lighten thy wing; But thou livest a hermit these deserts among, And echo alone makes reply to thy song. And while thou art chanting, With head thus upslanting, Thou seemest a thought or a vision, Which flits in its haste O'er the heart's dreary waste, With an influence soothing, Elysianâ Or a lone Sweet tone, That sounds for a time in the ear of Sorrow; And soon, Too soon, I must leave thee, and bid thee a long good morrow. But if thou wilt turn To the South thy wing, I will meet thee again E'er the end of spring; And thy nest can be made where the peach and the vine Shall shade thee, and leaf and tendril entwine. Oh! thou art a stranger, And darer of danger, That over these mountains hast flown, And the land of the North Is the clime of thy birth, And here thou, like me, art alone. Go back On thy track; It were wiser and better for thee and me, Than to moan Alone, So far from the waves of our own bright sea: And the eyes that we left To grow dim months ago, Will greet us again With their idolized glow. Let us goâlet us goâand revisit our home, Where the oak leaves are green and the sea-waters foam. Valley of Tisuqui, March 20, 1832. LINES Written in Santa Fe, Noon of Feb. 15, 1832. The sun is dull, the mist amid, That like a grief is shading him; And though the mountain be not hid, His distant blue is shining dim, And marking with its outline deep The paler blue that bends above. The winds have fanned themselves to sleep, And scarcely now their soft wings move, With an unquiet slumberous motion, Watched by the pale and flitting noon, The wanderer of earth and ocean, Whose stay all men desire, but none obtain the boon. It is the hour of deepest thought, When noise hath all a slumberous tone, A dream-like indistinctness, fraught With all which makes man feel alone. It may be in the hour and timeâ It may be only in the heartâ The cause that from the soul's abyme Makes Time's old images to start; When all that we have lost, or left, Or loved, or worshipped, at our youth, Comes up like an unwelcome gift, With all the sad and stern reality of truth. The stormy image of the past Upon me at this time doth rise; And, gazing in the distant vast, Dim shapes I see with saddened eyes, Like those that I have known before, Yet altered, as I too have changed, And some that near my heart I wore, And some whose insults I avenged. Ah yes! I know that sad, fair faceâ Thy matchless formâthy witcheryâ Thy step of airâthy winning grace! Ah yes! I see thee in the dim obscurity. My grief has now become as still As is the sunlight or this wind; And yet it knoweth well to fill, With shapes like these, the gazing mind: And Memory yields not yet her powerâ Not yet her serpent sting will die; Life is compressed into one hourâ A momentâby her searching eye: And then a little fiend sits near, And chatters of the lost and dead, And hearts for woe grown chill and sere, And points to Friendship's grave, as I his blood had shed. And FancyâMemory's sisterâweaves No golden web of hope for me; Or if she smile, she still deceives With all a wanton's mockery. She paints to me a fireless hearth, Or, worse than any other sting We feel upon the lonely earth, Cold hearts, and colder welcoming; Friends wasted by life's ebbing tide, Like sands along the shifting coasts; The soul's best love another's bride; And other worldless thoughts that haunt like unformed ghosts. Well, I have chosen my own long path, And I will walk it to the death, Though Love's lone grief, or Hatred's wrath, My way and purpose hindereth. It may be, when this heart is cold, And it were vain to love or hateâ When all that malice knows is told, Some better name may on me wait; And as the misty mountain mane Doth not forever shade its blue, The gloom on me may not remain, When life, and love, and hope, have nought with me to do. AGAPOU PNEUMA. Thou must have altered in the two long years Which thou hast passed since I beheld thee, Ann! For then thou wast just budding into life, And Hopes, with fiery eyes, thy heart did fan, And gray Grief's tears Had not assailed thee. Thou wast very rife With budding beauty, which is now full blown In all the sunny spring of womanhood. Thy spirit shone Like an etherial angel's in thy face: There was a proud and an impassioned tone Within thy voice, that breathed from off the soul A strong enchantment on a heart like mine. Thou wast a glorious being in thy bud; But in thy blossom, thou must be divine. Oh! I can fancy thee in all thy power, In all thy beauty and magnificence; Thine eyes so beautiful, and so intense, Raining into the heart their starry shower; Thy raven hair shining above a brow Replete with Italy and with divinity; Thy form so slight, so very delicate, Yet swelling proudly with thy uncontrolled And uncontrollable spirit. Oh! how cold Seems beauty to me, when I think on thee, Thou beautiful and bright and fiery star! And I afar Bow down before thee, though I have no hope To win or wear thee near my withered heart. Thou wast too full of uncontrolled romance, Too full of Poetry's impassioned trance, Too full of soul, to live amid the world. Thy body to thy soul was like a cloud, In which the silver arrows of the sun Stay not, but pass wherever they are hurled; 'T was like the clear transparent element, That shows the emerald beneath it pent, Nor robs one ray. Thy soul breathed in thy face, And lay upon it like a visible mist. Thou wast not fit for life's realities; The world all seemed too fair unto thine eyes; Thou wast too full of hope, and faith, and trustâ And art, perhaps, ere this, most undeceived. Thy heavenly eyes, perhaps, have been, and are, Dim with the dew which wastes away the heartâ And such a heart! Oh! it is sad to think That all the richer feelings of the soul Are but its torment; that the lustrous star Which shines the brightest, soonest wastes away; Yeaâthat the gifted soul, that will, must drink Of poetry, romance, and glowing love, Kindles a fire that must consume itself! And thou wilt be unhappy. Never one Was gifted with thy fervid, trusting soul, And went through life unscathed and sorrowless. And thou and I, too, soon will reach our goal. The world, which ought thy glorious spirit to bless, Will chill thee, Ann! and make thy heart grow cold; And thou wilt never, save in grief, be old. This, this it is, which makes me love thee. I Feel that there is between my soul and thine A sympathy of feeling and of fate, Which binds me to thee with a deathless tie. Time has already seen my heart decay, Where Death has trod. Yet, though it wastes away, Daily and nightly, still the core is left, And burns for thee with all its former fire; There is concentred all. I would to God Thou couldst be mine, Ann! for the few short years Left me to live; that when my death was nigh, Thou mights be near me with thy glorious eyes, Shining like stars into my waning soulâ Thy arms be wreathed around my neckâthy lip Pressed to my throbbing browâthy voice Hushing Despair, and that unconquered fiend, Ambitionâtill it were No pain to die, and breathe upon the wind My last low gasp. Methinks if thou wast mine, I might forget the world, and wo, and care, And let them wreak their worst on me: perhaps, My heart might be too strong for them to crush: It may not be. My fate is fixed. I ask the world a boon, I cannot, will not, Ann, demand of thee: Henceforth I pray the world that it forget That I have lived. All that I now have left, Is death and my own wo; and I will die, Unknown, unnamed. The world shall not be nigh, To mark the quivering lipâthe stopping heartâ The closing eyeâthe fingers clenched in Deathâ The last low moan, when with the parting shiver, I murmur, Ann. Arkansas Territory, 10th March, 1832. THE FALL OF POLAND. Written on receiving, in Santa Fe, the news that Poland had again fallen. She hath sunken again into Slavery's tomb, Like a thunderbolt quenching itself in the sea; And deeply and darkly is written her doomâ âHer existence is doneâshe can never be free.â From the darkness that shrouded her tomb she arose, And, throwing her cerements of bondage aside, She flung her defiance and scorn at her foes, And her banner was spread, as of old, in its pride. 'T was the contest of right against all that was wrong; 'T was the strife of the brave for their life and their laws; And every soul, to whose pulse did belong One throb of nobility, prayed for her cause. It grew like a stream in the rains of the spring, Or the clouds of the thunder that rise in the west; And wide and more wide, as the unfolding wing Of an eagle, that springs from the hill of his rest; Till there was not a heart, through which rushed the red blood Of a Polack, that did not bound into her ranks; Till all hands were united; till like the spring flood Of a river she moved, overflowing its banks. Then above her the old banner waved in the air, Over city and plain, as had once been its wont; And the souls of her mighty departed were there, Like the shadows of gods leading on in the front. But the fetters are bound on her limbs once again, And red hot, as they clasp them, are quenched in her gore; And down on her soul thunders misery's rain, While the blackness of tyranny shadows her o'er. Oh! shame on ye, once again, sons of the Gaul! Ye had just become free, and ye might have been great; Yet ye suffered the noblest of nations to fall, And lie bleeding and tortured once more at the gate Of the Wolf of the North, who, with fangs bloody red, Yet mangles the corse of the stag he has slain; Oh shame on your souls!âye had better be dead, Than defiled as ye are, by this cowardly stain: When a word from your mouth, like the thunderbolt's flame, Would have sent back the Wolf to his haunt in the snow, And rendered the hater of Freedom as tame As the worst of his serfs, that lies crouching and low; When you might have been held like the gods of the world, And your memory kept in its worship and love; When, had you the shaft of defiance but hurled, The thunder of God would have helped from above; That then ye should stand like base cowards aloof, While the blood of the brave spouted out of their veins; While their fabric of freedom was shatteredâits roof Tumbled into the dust by war's tempest and rains. Live on, then, foul slaves! Let your citizen king Bind your hearts with the chains which ye unto him flung; But this deed shall, a halo of shame, round ye cling, Which shall never be lost while the world has a tongue. February 1, 1832. SONNET. She is not beautifulâbut in her eyes No common spirit shadows forth itself; So mild, so quiet, so serenely wise, Yet merry, as of any dainty elf That dances on the turf by star-lit skies. And such a friend she isâso good and trueâ So free from envy, scorn, or prejudice; She is as constant as high heaven is blue; She seems like some most gentle, lustrous star, Which men will love, because it dazzles not. And though I wear away my life afar, Still, in this mountainous and savage spot, I think of her, as one who soothed my care, And did her best to keep me from despair. Valley of the Picuris, September 2, 1832. ON THE LOSS OF A SISTER. Written on hearing of the loss of a Sister, who died March ?, 1832. And thou, too, O my Sister! thou art dead: And desolation once again has sped His fiery arrow at the lonely heart. Thus one by one from me, alas! depart The images that, in the memory stored, I count and view, as misers do their hoard; They that along the wide waste of existence, Have been, and are, the gentle spirits, whence I gather strength to struggle on with life. The first fierce sudden stroke the heart that crushedâ The first wild feelings through the brain that rushedâ Are gone, and grief hath now become more mild; And I have wept as though I were a childâ I, who had thought my heart contained no tear. And I have but returned from deserts drearâ Prairie, and snow, and mountain eminent, At my first step upon my father-land, To feel the snapping of another band, Of those that bind me slightly to the world. And thou! whose rainbow spirit now hath furled Its wings, and gone to quiet sleep within The dimness of the graveâamid the din Of calumny which rose around my name, When I left foes the guardians of my fameâ Amid the sneer, the smile, the slander rank, Thy love, thy confidence, thy faith ne'er shrank. Yea, when I tore asunder the few ties Which bound me tot he land of sunny eyes, And broke the bands I could no longer bear, Of poverty, enthralment, toil and care; When love, and hope, and joy were changed to dreams And fantasies, that, with their starry gleams, Like things of memory, come upon the soul; Then, then, my sister! did the big tear roll Down thy pale cheek for me, thy only brother. Thy love hath been like that of my dear mother; And it hath fed my heart with gentle dew, And on my shadowed soul its soothing hue Lay like the sunlight on a broken flower. Yea, in the darkness of full many an hour, When I have climbed above surpassing mountains, Where from the deathless snows break out cold fountains; When storm hath beat upon me; when my head Hath made the ground, the rock, the snow, its bed; And I have watched cold stars career aboveâ Then, then my comforter hath been thy love. When I have felt most sad and most alone; When I have walked in multitudes unknown, With none that I could greet for olden time, Or in those silent solitudes sublime, Where even echo shuns the loneliness, And ceases with abundant voice to bless; When I have thought that I was all forgot By ancient friendsâor if in one lone spot Within the heart I still was kept in mind, It was as one disgraced, deluded, blind; Then, more than ever, then, in the intense And overpowering wo, thy confidence, Thy faith, and love, my comforters have been, And weaned me from myself and from my spleen. For friendsâbut I reproach them not, nor heed them nowâ What there is left of life, with changeless brow, And with unquailing heart, I can performâ Front the world's frown, and dare its wildest storm, Live out my day, and fall into my grave, Nor even then the help of friendship crave, To hide my bones. And yetâhush, heart! tell not thy weakness; let False friends not know that thou hast ever wet My eyelids with a tear for their neglect. Why do I speak here of myself? Oh! grief Is egotisticalâand finds relief In sad reflection, even on itself. Well, thou art dead; and thou didst for me plead, In all the fervent spirit of thy creed; And happily didst sink to thy last sleep, Trusting to rise at sounding of the deep And awful angel-trumpet. Be it so; For me, I have yet more of life to go. Perhaps, ere death shall close my quenched eyes, I yet may sleep beneath my well-known skiesâ Weep o'er the graves that my affections hoard, Veiling the eyes and hearts I have adored; And if, perchance, some one or two are left, Sire, mother, sisters, take them to my heart, Shield them, defend them, that when I shall die, Some one above the wanderer's grave may sigh. Arkansas Territory, Jan. 12, 1833. TO A?. These lines are to thee; and they come from a heart, Which hath never to thee spoken aught but the truth, And which fain would, ere life from its fountains depart, Speak to thee of the sorrows which clouded its youth. And think not 't is only to show a fair rhyme, Or a glittering thought to the eye of the world; Oh no! 't is a motive more purely sublime; My wings of ambition forever are furled. 'T is my love, my devotion, which will find a tongue, And utter its thoughts before life and I sever; 'T is the heart which was bruised, and then wantonly flung On the shore of life's sea, to be trampled forever. For its words, and its thoughts, and its feelings have been Misconceived, misconstrued, and traduced for long years; And 't would fain, from the general calumny, win One heart, that might water its grave-sod with tears. For the world, I defy it and dare it; it hath No power, no terror, no lash, over me; I ask not the light of its smile in my path, And its pity or frown might as well urge the sea. I owe it, and ask it no favor; full well I have proven its friendship, its mercy, its love; But thou hast upon me a charm and a spell, That through life and in death will be able to move. I would show that the heart which the world hath reviled, Whose passions have been like the waves of the sea, Whate'er it hath beenâhow ungoverned and wildâ Hath been constantly true in devotion to thee. That devotion to thee, love, hath never been told: Perhaps 't was unnoticed; the feeling most deep Has the semblance of something unfeeling and cold; The grief most o'erwhelming but seldom can weep. And readier tongues spake their tale in thine ear, And told thee their love with full many a sigh: Perhaps thou wast dazzled by that and the tear, And read not my love in the heart and the eye. I told not my loveâit were cruel to ask One like thee, with misfortune and sorrow to wed, To wear away life as an incessant task, And pillow on Poverty's bosom thy headâ Till I turned from the green and the delicate lanes Of home, love and joy, which were darkened with gloom, And shivered, unflinching, the multiplied chains, Which are woven round all when the heart is in bloom. Since then, day by day, my lone heart hath decayed, With a slow, but a certain, and deadly decline; O'er its waste and its wilderness riseth no blade, Which may say with its greennessââWo! all is not thine.â And though I must die ere my deity sphere Be revealed from the storm which holds heaven at will, I must turn to the place where it ought to appear, And worship its light till my pulses be still. It may be that I am to live till my cup Of affliction be filled and o'erflow at the brim; Till the mist and the blood from the heart shall rise up, When its last hope is goneâits last vision is dim; Till thou hast become, in thy beauty, the bride Of some other less wild, and less passionate lover; Then the beacon is merged in the hungering tideâ Then the heart hath been crushed, and its struggle is over. Arkansas Territory, Feb. 12, 1833. SIMILES, IN TWO SONNETS. Above me are the dazzling snows; around The mountains bend, high, rocky and eterne; Anear the rattling rivulet doth sound, And far below, it hath the bosom found Of a bright lake, that seemeth not to spurn One ray of sunlight from its gentle presence, But doth embody all, and seemeth changed To sheeted light by Sol's etherial essence. O silver star! for whom doth ever burn The altar of my soul's idolatry! Let thy bright arrows sink into the sea Of my sad soul, until it gently calm; And though thou canst but people a lone dream, Oh soothe me like an angel's silver palm. And close beyond, the mountains gray upstream, Like cloudy shades, into the upper air. Perpetual watchers do the giants seem Of the lake's quiet. Lo! their heads are bare Beneath God's presence, which is mighty there, In the etherial, keen, thin element. A floating cloud hath down from heaven bent, And on the hill-side feeds the springing leaves, And into water-drops its soul doth weave, Feeding the streams. O lady of my love! Be thou, though absent, like the silver cloud, Over my soul. Oh may thy spirit move, Feeding its dark and parched wilderness! And once, or ere I die, touch, transport, bless! Mountains of Xemes, April 15, 1832. WAR SONG OF THE COMANCHES. Oh, who with the sons of the plain can compete, When from west, south and north like the torrents they meet? And when doth the face of the white trader blanche, Except when at moon rise he hears the Comanche? Will you speak in our lodge of a bold Caiawah? He is brave, but it is when our braves are afar; Will you talk of the gun of the Arapeho? Goâfirst see the arrow spring off from our bow. The white wolf goes with us wherever we ride; For food there is plenty on every side; And Mexican bones he has plenty to cranch, When he follows the troop of the flying Comanche. The Toyah exults in his spear and his shield, And the Wequahâbut both have we taught how to yield; And the Panana horses our women now ride, While their scalps in our lodges are hung side by side. Let the Wawsashy boast; he will run like a deer, When afar on the prairie our women appear; The shaven scalps hang, in each lodge three or fourâ We will count then again, and ere long there'll be more. The Gromonts came downâ'tis three summers agoâ To look for our scalps and to hunt buffalo; But they turned to the mountains their faces again, And the trace of their lodges is washed out by rain. The Spirit above never sends us his curse, And the buffalo never gets angry with us; We are strong as the stormâwe are free as the breeze; And we laugh at the power of the pale Ikanese. Note H. Let them come with the pipe; we will tread it to dust, And the arrow of war shall ne'er moulder with rust: Let them come with their hosts; to the desert we'll flee, And the drought and the famine our helpers shall be. The mountain Shoshones have hearts big and strong; Our brothers they are, and they speak the same tongue: And let them in battle but stand by our side, And we scorn Ikanese and black Spaniard allied. Oo-oo-ha! Come out from the Brazos CaÃ±on! Note I. Let us range to the head of the salt Semaron! For our horses are swift, and there 's hair to be won, When the Ikanese waggons their track are upon. SONG OF THE NABAJO Who rideth so fast as a fleet Nabajo? Whose arm is so strong with the lance and the bow? His arrow in battle as lightning is swift; His march is the course of the mountainous drift. The Eutaw can ride down the deer of the hills, With his shield ornamented with bald-eagle quills; Our houses are full of the skins he has drest; We have slaves of his women, the brightest and best. Go, talk of the strength of a valiant Paiut, Note K. He will hide in the trees when our arrows we shoot; And who knows the wild Coyotera to tame, But the bold Nabajo, with his arrow of flame? The Moqui may boast from his town of the Rock; Can it stand when the earthquake shall come with its shock? The Suni may laugh in his desert so dryâ He will wail to his God when our foray is nigh. Oh, who is so brave as a mountain Apache? He can come to our homes when the doors we unlatch, And plunder our women when we are away; When met he our braves in their battle array? Whose mouth is so big as a Spaniard's at home? But if we rush along like the cataract foam, And sweep off his cattle and herds from his stall, Oh then to the saints who so loudly can call? Up, then, and away! Let the quiver be full! And as soon as the stars make the mountain air cool, The fire of the harvest shall make heaven pale, And the priesthood shall curse, and the coward shall wail. And there will be counting of beads then to doâ And the Pueblos shall mount and prepare to pursue; But when could their steeds, so mule-footed and slow, Compare with the birds of the free Nabajo? LINES, Written on hearing that Wm. R. Schenck, my companion for three or four months in the prairie, had been wounded by the Comanches, and left alone to die. The sun is waning from the sky, The clouds are gathering round the moon, Bank after bank, like mountains high, And night is comingâah! too soon. Around me doth the prairie spread Its limitless monotony, And near me, in its sandy bed, Runs rattling water, like the sea, Salt, salt as tears of misery; And now the keen and frosty dew Begins to fall upon my head, And pierces every fibre throughâ By it my torturing wound with misery is fed. And near me lies my noble horse: I watched his last, convulsive breath, And saw him stiffen to a corseâ And knew like his would be my death. The cowards left me lying here To die; and now three weary days, I've watched the sun's light disappear; Again I shall not see his raysâ On my dead heart they soon will blaze; O God! it is a fearful thing, To be alone in this wide plain, To hear the raven's filthy wing, And watch the quivering star of our existence wane. Yes; I am left alone to dieâ Alone! alone!âit is no dream; At times I think it isâthough nigh, Already dimly sounds the stream; And I must dieâand wolves will gnaw My corse, or ere the pulse be still, Before my parting gasp I draw; This doth my cup of torture fillâ This, this it is which sends a thrill Of horror through my inmost brain, And makes me die a thousand deaths. I value not the passing pain, But I would draw in peace, my last, my parting breath. And here, while left, all, all alone To dieâ(how strange that word will sound)â O God! with many a torture-tone, The fiends of memory come around. They tell of one, untimely sent Unto the dim and narrow grave, By honor's lawsâand friends down bent With grief, that I, the reckless, gave; And bending from each airy wave, I see the shapes I loved and lost Come round me with their deep, dim eyes, Like drowning men to land uptost, And here and there one mocks, and my vain rage defies. O God! my children. Spare the thought! Bid it depart from me, lest I At last to madness should be wrought, And cursing thee, insanely die. Hush! for the pulse is getting slow, And death, chill death is near at hand. I turn me from the sunset glow, And looking towards my native land Where the dim clouds like giants stand, I strain my eyesâif I perchance, Might see beneath the still, cold moon, Some shape of human kind advance, To give a dying man the last, the dearest boon. In vain!âin vain! No being comesâ And all is lone and desolate; Deeper and darker swell the glooms, And with them Death and eyeless Fate. Now I am dying! Well I know The pangs that gather round the heart; The brow's weak throb has ceased to glow, And life and I are near to part. I would not ask the leech's artâ For death is not so terrible As 't was. And now, no more I see;â My tongue is faltering;â't is wellâ O God!âmy soul!â't is thineâtake it to thee. Ark. Territory, March 20, 1833. THE LIGHTNING. The breath of the ocean my cradle is, Which the sun takes up from the blue abyss; And the upper cold gives it shape and form, And it peoples itself with living storm. And when it has reached the upper air, I hold its helm while it wanders there; And I lie in the shade of the lifted sail, And steer my boat before the gale. I coil myself like a quivering snake, Invisible on a chaotic lake; And I stay unseen in the chasms of cloud, And the vapors that even to earth are bowed. I look on the stars with my glittering eye, And they hide away while the clouds go by; And while my eye and form are unseen, The meteors down to my palace lean. And when my cradle is shaken by wind, And moon and stars are eyeless behind, Oh then I quiver, and mankind see Me lose invisibility. I look in the eye of the winged stars, And they wheel away their orbal cars, And hide afar in the depths of heaven, Like water-drops by the tempest driven. I look on the sunâand he hideth under The misty plume of my servant, Thunder; And the moon shuts up her arching lid, And the eye by which the tides are fed. I take the form of a fiery adder, And dash myself down the heaving ladder Of cloud, till I hiss on the ocean's breast, And it foams and awakes from its azure rest. I take the form of an arrow of flame, And I pierce the clouds and make darkness tame; And the flap of night's dark, drifting sail, Shakes down to the earth the glancing hail. I dash myself against rifted rocks, And the echoes awake and come in flocks; And each with his hoarse and rattling tongue, Throws back the challenge the thunder flung. And often when heaven's unstained floor Is as far from dim as the inmost core Of an angel's heart, I am seen to glide From the lid of the west;âthus the cheek of a bride Will blush when her lover's step is heard;â And then, like the wing of a heavy bird, My voice of thunder afar wakes, And the dim sunset his pinion shakes. And there all night I am seen to quiver, Like the pulse of an adamantine river, That out of the depth doth come and goâ And my cradle of cloud is unseen below. I am hidden in earth, and air, and water; I am parent of life, and king of slaughter; I green the earthâI open the flowers, And make then blush by the lip of showers. I am the heart's etherial essence, And life exists not, save in my presence; I am the soul of the mighty earth, And give its children their vital birth. I go to the heart of the hidden rocks, And my touch awakens the earthquake shocks; I am the soul of the flowers and buds, And I feed them with air and water-floods. I am eternal, and change forever; I wander always, but dissipate never; Decay and waste no power possess On me the deathless and fatherless. Unelemental, immaterial, Less gross than aught that is etherial, And next to spirit in rank am I; While matter exists I can never die. SONG. The day hath passed, love, when I might Have offered thee this heart of mine, As one whose yet unclouded light Was pure, love, pure and bright, as thine: When, though I gazed on thee, as him Who gazeth on a distant star, Thy brilliant eye could not grow dim, In shame for me, thy worshipper. Yet still, although it be but shame To be beloved by such as I, That love will shed its saddened flame, Knows no decay, can never die. Its soul of fire hath no decline; For rocks check not the swelling river; And though thou never canst be mine, I'm thine, loveâthine alone, forever. HOME. Though the heart hath been sunken in folly and guiltâ Though its hopes and its joys on the earth have been spiltâ Though its course hath become like the cataract's foamâ Still, still it is holy, when thinking on Home. Though its tears have been shed like the rains of the springâ Though it may have grown loath to existence to clingâ Oh, still a sweet thought like a shadow will come, When the eye of the mind turns again to its Home. Though the fire of the heart may have withered its core Unto ashes and dustâthough the head have turned hoar Ere its time, as the surfs o'er the breakers that foamâ Still, a tear will arise when we think upon Home. LINES Written in the Vale of the Picuris, Sept. 3, 1832. The light of morning now begins to thrill Upon the purple mountains, and the gray And mist-enveloped pines; and on the still, Deep banks of snow, looks out the eye of day; The constant stream is plashing on its way, As molten stars might roll along the heavenâ And its white foam grows whiter, with the play Of sunlight, that adown its bed is driven, Like the eternal splendor from God's forehead riven. And tree, and rock, and pine, are wreathed now With light, as with a visible soul of love; The breeze along the mountain sides doth blow, And in and out each grass-enshaded cove, Making the darkness from those dens remove, And be dissolved within the splendor shower, Which raineth to the depth of each dim grove, And under all the rocks that sternly lower, And even in the caves, and jagged grots doth pour. Yet here and there, there is a plume of mist, Whose only care is up the hill to float, Until the sun be broad and fair uprist; And then the unseen angels, that take note To steer in safety this etherial boat, Will turn its helm to heaven's untroubled seas, Where its white sail will glimmer, like a mote, One moment, and then vanish: now the trees Through it are seen, like shadows through transparencies. And now the dew from off the flower-bells, And from the quivering blades of bending grass, Begins to rise invisibly, and swells Into the airâ(the valley's silent mass)â Like to the incense which to God doth pass From out the bruised heart; the cricket's hymnâ The anthem from bright birds of many a classâ All people with their influence, the dim Soul's solitude, in this most brief, sweet interim. And Sorrow, though she be not wholly still, Hath yet a certain gentle look and kind, And mingling with all nature's joyous thrill, Breathes a delicious feeling on the mindâ A soothing melancholy, hope-inclinedâ Like the dim memory of a saddened dream, Which made the heart once weep itself stone-blind, And now doth like both pain and pleasure seem, Until we know not which the feeling we should deem. But Sorrow will full soon regain her own, Although this golden and delicious calm, Hath made her gentle as the water-tone, Till she doth sleep, like Peace, with open palm, And closed eyelid, and enfolded arm; Soon Memory beneath her eye will sting, And like a fiend that does his best to harm, From the dark past will gather up, and bring, Full many a torturing, and half-forgotten thing. And she will point to home and hope forsakenâ And friends grown old, perhaps inimical; And Love beneath her eye again will waken, From troublous slumber; and again will fall Foul Poverty, that hid with icy pall My hope and happiness and father-land; And I once more shall stand amid them all, Cast them aside with an unflinching hand, Shiver my household gods, and mid the ruins stand. O thou, New England! whom these jagged rocksâ These chanting pinesâthis stream of fluid lightâ These mountains, heaved at first by earthquake shocks, And now defying themâthis upper white Of snow, which beards the sunâthis vale so brightâ And all the thousand objects here in viewâ Make now most present to the memory's sight Thy hillsâthy dellsâthy streamsâthy ocean blueâ Thy gorgeous sky, and clouds, of such surpassing hue. Oh! I have left theeâand perhaps forever, Land of the free, the beautiful, the brave! It was a mournful hour which saw me sever The ties which bound me unto thee, and brave The exile's woes, and seek an exile's grave. And now my heart is allâay, all thine own; Again above me thy hoar forests wave; Again I hear thy ocean's measured tone; I live with thee, and am with all the world alone. And spite of thy unkindness, I am proud To be thy son; yea, proud of thee and thine; Although thy failing, prejudice, hath bowed My highest hopes, and taught lone grief to twine Around my heart, as doth the poison-vine Around the oak, rotting it to its coreâ Yet still I love thee, and my heart is thine. And while my feet sound sadly, and forlore, I pace, and think of thee, and on thy glories pore. And here, beneath these mossless rocks and grey, I think of those most venerable aisles, Where I have passed of many a holy day, Into the sanctity of ancient piles, To sit and hear thy faithâof those green isles Gemming thy bays, and quiet ocean-nooksâ Of the bright eyes, and cheeks enwreathed with smiles, Which make thee famed for beauty's starry looksâ And more than all, I think of quietude and books. And still, all this is like the lightning, shot Athwart the visage of the midnight gloom; One moment dazzlingâthe succeeding, not: And when I think of one of thine, with whom The hours seemed winged with joy's all sunny plume, Then, then the torturing fiends again have powerâ Then from the darkness of my mental tomb Thy star doth wane, the clouds about me lowerâ And on me comes anew, the dark and fearful hour. What is there left that I should cling to life? High hopes made desolate, while scarce expandedâ A broken censer, still with odor rifeâ A waning sunâa vessel half ensandedâ Life's prospects on grey rocks and shallows strandedâ A star just setting in a midnight oceanâ A smoking altar broken and unbanded, Lit with the flame of poetry's devotionâ A bosom shattered with its own disturbed emotion. This scene, for once, has made my sorrow calm; And I do thank itâthough old Time may mar Full soon his work. And Hope has held her palm Like an old friend to me, and set her star Once more upon the waves of life afar; And though it sink full soon, nor ever lift Again its eye above the stormy bar, Yet still I thank her for the passing gift, Though henceforth eyeless, on life's stormy waves I drift. Farewell to thee, New England! Once again The echo of thy name has touched my soul, And it has vibratedâoh! not in vain, If thou and thine shall hear it. Now the goal Is nearly reachedâthe last expiring coal Is trampled. Lo! ere all of life be done, And ere the wind doth o'er my dead brain roll, Thou hast the last monotony of one, Who has beenâisâwill beâand that for aye, thy son. HOME. Full many a tongue, Liquid as may be, hath its praises sung; From his around whose lips the fond bees clung, Note L. Unto the wood-thrush wildâof âHome, sweet Home.â 'T is an old theme; yet if it can impart Some new, fresh feelings, ever to the heart, It may be thought of, when that heart is rife; Words are but feelings, and so home is life. Why is it that whate'er we hear or see, 'Minds us of home, with a strange witchery? Because the heart is to the harp most likeâ The simple Jewish harpâwhich, though you strike A thousand notes, hath still its undertone, The key-note of them all; and long and lone That tone is heard, after they all are dead. The sound of rain upon the humble roofâ ('T is an old thought, I know, that needs no proof, But I do use it, since its force I feel,)â The sound of music, following on the heel Of priests, as worthless as the music isâ The fairy foot that glances past the door, The eye, that nothing seems but love to pour From all its deep, black, keen intensity;â One brings to memory The rains, that oft have lulled me unto rest, In the old mansion, after, from the west, Them rising slowly up, I had beholden, And covering with their frown the bright and golden, But dying smile of the chill-hearted sunâ Of the small stream, that near the old house run, As if a smile of friendship there had fallen, And coursed alongâthe fields with gray rocks wallen, And every old and much familiar thing, That seemed to watch and love me, slumbering; The other seems the breathing of the flute Of my old friend, so rich, so round and clearâ (Yet sweet as 't was, when all its tones were mute, His voice was still more pleasant to my ear); The lastâbut that's a dreamâ Yet it may seem, That one may keep alive a sunny dream Within the few green places of his heart, Where Want and Wo long since have wiled themselves, Like the ice-worm of Taurus. God of heaven! Never from me let that fond dream be riven: The dream of hope, love, joy and home, again, As to the dry grass doth a summer rain, Doth unto me a new existence prove. It is like some lone, silver, sad-eyed dove, Sitting amid the elements' commotion, And fanning with her wings the angry ocean, Until she make herself a quiet nook, Quiet as heaven. It is like some sad book, Of beautiful words, in which the angry reads Until, within his heart, new thoughts it feeds, Till, as the book is, he is quiet too. It is like anything most sweet and strange, Which can our angry, tortured passions change Unto more mildness, in its soothing way. It is the theme which keeps me from despair; That, be my grief or sorrows what they may, Their sepulchre, their burial clothes are there. Santa Fe, Jan. 5, 1832. TO THE PLANET JUPITER. Thou art, in truth, a fair and kingly star, Planet! whose silver crest now gleams afar Upon the edge of yonder eastern hill, That, night-like, seems a third of heaven to fill. Thou art most worthy of a poet's lore, His worshipâas a thing to bend before; And yet thou smilest as if I might sing, Weak as I amâmy lyre unused to ring Among the thousand harps which fill the world. The sun's last fire upon the sky has curled, And on the clouds, and now thou hast arisen, And in the east thine eye of love doth glistenâ Thou, whom the ancients took to be a king, And that of gods; and, as thou wert a spring Of inspiration, I would soar and drink, While yet thou art upon the mountain's brink. Who bid men say that thou, O silver peer, Wast to the moon a servitor, anear To sit, and watch her eye for messages, Like to the other fair and silver bees That swarm around her when she sits her throne? What of the moon? She bringeth storm alone, At new, and full, and every other time; She turns men's brains, and so she makes them rhyme, And rave, and sigh away their weary life; And shall she be of young adorers rife, And thou have none? Nay, one will sing to thee, And turn his eye to thee, and bend the knee. Lo! on the marge of the dim western plain, The star of love doth even yet remainâ She of the ocean-foamâand watch thy look, As one might gaze upon an antique book, When he doth sit and read, at deep dead night, Stealing from Time his hours. Ah, sweet delay! And now she sinks to follow fleeting day, Contended with thy glance of answering love: And where she worships can I thoughtless prove? Now as thou risest higher into sight, Marking the water with a line of light, On wave and ripple quietly aslant, Thy influences steal upon the heart, With a sweet force and unresisted art, Like the still growth of some unceasing plant. The mother, watching by her sleeping child, Blesses thee, when thy light, so still and mild, Falls through the casement on her babe's pale face, And tinges it with a benignant grace, Like the white shadow of an angel's wing. The sick man, who has lain for many a day, And wasted like a lightless flower away, He blesses thee, O Jove! when thou dost shine Upon his face, with influence divine, Soothing his thin, blue eyelids into sleep. The child its constant murmuring will keep, Within the nurse's arms, till thou dost glad His eyes, and then he sleeps. The thin, and sad, And patient student, closes up his books A space or so, to gain from thy kind looks Refreshment. Men, in dungeons pent, Climb to the window, and, with head upbent, Gaze they at thee. The timid deer awake, And, 'neath thine eye, their nightly rambles make, Whistling their joy to thee. The speckled trout, From underneath his rock comes shooting out, And turns his eye to thee, and loves thy light, And sleeps within it. The gray water plant Looks up to thee beseechingly aslant, And thou dost feed it there, beneath the wave. Even the tortoise crawls from out his cave, And feeds wherever, on the dewy grass, Thy light hath lingered. Thou canst even pass To water-depths, and make the coral-fly Work happier, when flattered by thine eye. Thou touchest not the roughest heart in vain; Even the sturdy sailor, and the swain, Bless thee, whene'er they see thy lustrous eye Open amid the clouds, stilling the sky. The lover praises thee, and to thy light Compares his love, thus tender and thus bright; And tells his mistress thou dost kindly mock Her gentle eye. Thou dost the heart unlock Which Care and Wo have rendered comfortless, And teachest it thy influence to bless, And even for a time its grief to brave. The madman, that beneath the moon doth rave, Looks to thy orb, and is again himself. The miser stops from counting out his pelf, When, through the barred windows comes thy lullâ And even he, he thinks thee beautiful. Oh! while thy silver arrows pierce the air, And while beneath thee, the dim forests, where The wind sleeps, and the snowy mountains tall Are still as deathâoh! bring me back again The bold and happy heart that blessed me, when My youth was green; ere home and hope were vailed In desolation! Then my cheek was paled, But not with care. For, late at night, and long, I toiled, that I might gain myself among Old tomes, a knowledge; and in truth I did: I studied long, and things the wise had hid In their quaint books, I learned; and then I thought The poet's art was mine; and so I wrought My boyish feelings into words, and spread Them out before the worldâand I was fed With praise, and with a name. Alas! to him, Whose eye and heart must soon or late grow dim, Toiling with poverty, or evils worse, This gift of poetry is but a curse, Unfitting it amid the world to brood, And toil and jostle for a livelihood. The feverish passion of the soul hath been My bane. O Jove! couldst thou but wean Me back to boyhood for a space, it were Indeed a gift. There was a sudden stir, Thousands of years ago, upon the sea; The waters foamed, and parted hastily, As though a giant left his azure home, And Delos woke, and did to light up come Within that Grecian sea. Latona had, Till then, been wandering, listlessly and sad, About the earth, and through the hollow vast Of water, followed by the angry haste Of furious Juno. Many a weary day, Above the shaggy hills where, groaning, lay Enceladus and Typhon, she had roamed, And over volcanoes, where fire upfoamed; And sometimes in the forests she had lurked, Where the fierce serpent through the herbage worked, Over gray weeds, and tiger-trampled flowers, And where the lion hid in tangled bowers, And where the panther, with his dappled skin, Made day like night with his deep moaning din: All things were there to fright the gentle soulâ The hedgehog, that across the path did roll, Gray eagles, fanged like cats, old vultures, bald, Wild hawks and restless owls, whose cry appalled, Black bats and speckled tortoises, that snap, And scorpions, hiding underneath gray stones, With here and there old piles of human bones Of the first men that found out what was war, Brass heads of arrows, rusted scimetar, Old crescent, shield and edgeless battle-axe, And near them skulls, with wide and gaping cracks, Too old and dry for worms to dwell within; Only the restless spider there did spin, And made his house. And then she down would lay Her restless head, among dry leaves, and faint, And close her eyes, till thou wouldst come and paint Her visage with thy light; and then the blood Would stir again about her heart, endued, By thy kind look, with life again, and speed; And then wouldst thou her gentle spirit feed With new-winged hopes, and sunny fantasies, And, looking piercingly amid the trees, Drive from her path all those unwelcome sightsâ Then would she rise, and o'er the flower-blights, And through the tiger-peopled solitudes, And odorous brakes, and panther-guarded woods, Would keep her way until she reached the edge Of the blue sea, and then on some high ledge Of thunder-blackened rocks, would sit and look Into thine eye, nor fear lest, from some nook, Should rise the hideous shapes that Juno ruled, And persecute her. Once her feet she cooled Upon a long and narrow beach. The brine Had marked, as with an endless serpent spine, The sanded shore with a long line of shells, Like those the Nereids weave, within the cells Of their queen Thetisâsuch they pile around The feet of cross old Nereus, having found That this will gain his grace, and such they bring To the quaint Proteus, as an offering, When they would have him tell their fate, and who Shall first embrace them with a lover's glow. And there Latona stepped along the marge Of the slow waves, and when one came more large, And wet her feet, she tingled, as when Jove Gave her the first, all-burning kiss of love. Still on she kept, pacing along the sand, And on the shells, and now and then would stand, And let her long and golden hair outfloat Upon the wavesâwhen lo! the sudden note Of the fierce hissing dragon met her ear. She shuddered then, and, all-possessed with fear, Rushed wildly through the hollow-sounding vast Into the deep, deep sea; and then she passed Through many wondersâcoral-raftered caves, Deep, far below the noise of upper wavesâ Sea-flowers, that floated into golden hair, Like misty silkâfishes, whose eyes did glare, And some surpassing lovelyâfleshless spine Of old behemothsâflasks of hoarded wine Among the timbers of old shattered shipsâ Goblets of gold, that had not touched the lips Of men a thousand years. And then she lay Her down, amid the ever-changing spray, And wished, and begged to die; and then it was, That voice of thine the deities that awes, Lifted to light beneath the Grecian skies, That rich and lustrous Delian paradise, And placed Latona there, while yet asleep, With parted lip, and respiration deep, And open palm; and when at length she woke, She found herself beneath a shadowy oak, Huge and majestic; from its boughs looked out All birds, whose timid nature 't is to doubt And fear mankind. The dove, with patient eyes, Earnestly did his artful nest devise, And was most busy under sheltering leaves; The thrush, that loves to sit upon gray eaves Amid old ivy, she too sang, and built; And mock-bird songs rang out like hail-showers spilt Among the leaves, or on the velvet grass; The bees did all around their store amass, Or down depended from a swinging bough, In tangled swarms. Above her dazzling brow The lustrous humming-bird was whirling; and, So near, that she might reach it with her hand, Lay a gray lizardâsuch do notice give When a foul serpent comes, and they do live By the permission of the roughest hind; Just at her feet, with mild eyes up-inclined, A snowy antelope cropped off the buds From hanging limbs; and in the solitudes No noise disturbed the birds, except the dim Voice of a fount, that, from the grassy brim, Rained upon violets its liquid light, And visible love; also, the murmur slight Of waves, that softly sang their anthem, and Trode gently on the soft and noiseless sand, As gentle children in sick chambers grieve, And go on tiptoe. Here, at call of eve, When thou didst rise above the barred east, Touching with light Latona's snowy breast And gentler eyes, and when the happy earth Sent up its dews to theeâthen she gave birth Unto Apollo and the lustrous Dian; And when the wings of morn commenced to fan The darkness from the east, afar there rose, Within the thick and odor-dropping forests, Where moss was grayest and dim caves were hoarest, Afar there rose the known and dreadful hiss Of the pursuing dragon. Agonies Grew on Latona's soul; and she had fled, And tried again the ocean's pervious bed, Had not Apollo, young and bright Apollo, Restrained from the dim and perilous hollow, And asked what meant the noise. âIt is, O child! The hideous dragon, that hath aye defiled My peace and quiet, sent by heaven's queen To slay her rival, me.â Upon the green And mossy grass there lay a nervous bow, And heavy arrows, eagle-winged, which thou, O Jove! hadst placed within Apollo's reach. These grasping, the young god stood in the breach Of circling trees, with eye that fiercely glanced, Nostril expanded, lip pressed, foot advanced, And arrow at the string; when lo! the coil Of the fierce snake came on with winding toil, And vast gyrations, crushing down the branches, With noise as when a hungry tiger cranches Huge bones: and then Apollo drew his bow Full at the eyeânor ended with one blow: Dart after dart he hurled from off the stringâ All at the eyeâuntil a lifeless thing The dragon lay. Thus the young sun-god slew Old Juno's scaly snake; and then he threw (So strong was he) the monster in the sea; And sharks came round and ate voraciously, Lashing the waters into bloody foam, By their fierce fights. Latona, then, might roam In earth, air, sea, or heaven, void of dread; For even Juno badly might have sped With her bright children, whom thou soon didst set To rule the sun and moon, as they do yet. Thou! who didst then their destiny control, I here would woo thee, till into my soul Thy light might sink. O Jove! I am full sure None bear unto thy star a love more pure Than I; thou hast been, everywhere, to me A source of inspiration. I should be Sleepless, could I not first behold thine orb Rise in the west; then doth my heart absorb, Like other withering flowers, thy light and life; For that neglect, which cutteth like a knife, I never have from thee, unless the lake Of heaven be clouded. Planet! thou wouldst make Me, as thou didst thine ancient worshippers, A poet; but, alas! whatever stirs My tongue and pen, they both are faint and weak: Apollo hath not, in some gracious freak, Given to me the spirit of his lyre, Or touched my heart with his etherial fire And glorious essence: thus, whate'er I sing Is weak and poor, and may but humbly ring Above the waves of Time's far-booming sea. All I can give is small; thou wilt not scorn A heart: I give no golden sheaves of corn; I burn to thee no rich and odorous gums; I offer up to thee no hecatombs, And build no altars: 't is a heart alone; Such as it is, I give itâ't is thy own. STANZAS TO ANN. The spirit in my soul hath woken, And bids me speak to thee again; And silence, many a day unbroken, Must cease, although it cease in vain. As life approaches to its goal, And other passions seem to die, The thoughts of thee that haunt the soul Decay not, sleep not, death defy. Love's busy wings delight to fan A heart that hath been worn to ashes, And, aided by thy spirit, Ann, Beneath his eye that heart still flashes. Oh! why doth Love build up his nest A ruined palace aye within, Hiding within the poet's breastâ Why seeks he not a home more green? He hath no alcyon power, to still The passions of the trampled heart, Rob of its pain the torture-thrill, Bid sorrow, want, and pain depart: Oh no! he adds a fiercer pang To every wo which rankles there, Sharpens the scorpion's fiery fang, Adds wildness unto terror's glare. Yet still, I love thee, and foreverâ No matter what or where I be; The blow which shall existence sever, Alone can end my love for thee. I love thee as men love but onceâ As few have loved, can love a woman; It seemeth strange, this perfect trance Of love, for one that is but human. But thou wast rich, and I was poor; I never spake my love to thee; And I could all my wo endure, Nor ask thee, Ann, to wed with me. To wed with me!âit were to wed With Poverty, and Want, and Wo: Rather than this, from thee I fled, And still a lonely outcast go. But day by day my love hath grown For thee, as all things else decline; And when I seem the most alone, Thy spirit doth commune with mine. I have no portion with the world, Nor hath the world a part with me; But the lone wave, now shoreward hurled, Will turn, yea, dying, turn to thee. I make to thee, thy love, no claim; I ask thee but, when I shall die, To lay the world-forgotten name Within thy heart, and o'er it sigh. Think that the love which I have felt, To which existence hath been given, Has been as pure as stars that melt And die within the depths of heaven. Fare thee wellâit is for ever! Thou hast heard my dying words; Till the cords of life shall sever, Till the serpent Wo, that girds The exile heart, its strings have broken, Bruised and crushed and shattered it; Until this, to thee are spoken All my wordsâmy dirge is writ. Ark. Territory, April 20, 1833. FANTASMA. I sit, unconscious of all things around, Gazing into my heart. Within its void There is an image, dim and indistinct, Of something which hath beenâI know not which, A dream, or a reality. In vain I seek to force it take a visible form, And be condensed to thought and memory. At times I catch a glimpse of it, behind The clouds and shadows, which fill up the chasm Of the dim soul. And when I seem to grasp The half-embodied echo of the dream, When it hath almost grown an audible sound, Then it retreats, hunting the inner caverns And undisturbed recesses of the mindâ Recesses yet unpeopled by quick thought, Or conscience, hope, live fear, or memoryâ And there they hide. Now, while I separate Myself yet more from my external life, And turn within, I see those floating thoughts Quiver amid the chaos of the heart; And slowly they assume a more distinct And palpable appearance. One by one, Dimly, like shadows upon ocean-waves, For a brief moment they are memory. I see a boy, reading at deep, dead night; The lamp illuminates his pallid face, Through the thin hand which shades his deep, black eyes, Half bedded in the clustering, damp, dark hair. He closes up the book, and rising, takes A step, a tottering step, or two, and speaks In low and murmuring tones unto himself:â âThe fountain is unsealed; this âannciente rimeâ Hath shown my powers to meâhath waked the tide Of poetry, which lay within the soul. Henceforth I know my fate; the latent love, Now well revealed, of wild and burning song, Will render me unhappy: until now I have not known the bent of my own mind. And now I look into it, as a new And unexhausted treasure. Burning words, Wild feelings, broken hopes, await me now. Oh! what a curse this gift of song will be! 'T will quicken the quick feelings, make still less The power of grasping happiness, give strength To every disappointment, wo and pain. If I win fame, ever unsatisfied; If notâbut I shall win itâand in vain. Oh! what a curse, indeed, were prophecy, And knowledge of the future. Could the soul Exist, and know what waits it, with no wing Of hope to shade it from the blasting eye Of hot despair? Well, be it so; the gift Must be received. Passion will have its way, Although the heart be shivered by its wild And stormy course. Although the eyes grow dimâ Dimmer than mine; although the unripe buds Of happiness are shaken from the stems Fed by the heart, and choak its fountains up With their decaying blights; yea, though that heart Be like a house desertedâwith the doors And windows open to the winter windâ The lamps extinct, the moonlight shining in Through barred casements and wind-moven blinds, With ghastly eye,âpassion will have its way.â I seem him hide his face within his hand. Was it to weep? It might be. He was young, And tears flow freely at the spring of life. In after years the desert is less moist, The fountains of the heart are deeper, or More choked and more obstructed. He was young, And had not known the bent of his own mind, Until the mighty spell of Coleridge woke Its hidden powers, as did the wondrous wand Of God's own prophet the sealed desert-rock. He saw his fate; he knew, that to a mind Enthusiastic, wayward, shy as his, It is a curse, this love of poetry; It is a thing which on the heart doth brood, Unfitting it for aught but solitude; Unfitting it to toil and jostle with The busy world, and gain amid its crowd The scanty pittance of a livelihood. He knew all this, and weptâwho would not weep? That shadow vanishes, and like a man Standing anear one broad monotonous sea, And gazing to its distant space, and void, And chasmal indistinctness, I behold Another shadow, gathering in the vast, Wherein are stored old dreams and antenatal echoes. And now its images and thoughts take shape. I see the boy sit in a crowded room. His eyes have still that look of wasting gloom And lustrous deepness; still his cheek is pale, His lips are thin and bloodless, and his form Is wan and wasted; bright eyes bend on him, (That might make summer in the wintry heart;) Transparent cheeks are flushed, whene'er his voice, With its low murmuring, is heard, as 't were, In lone communion with himselfâfor praise Has fed his eager spirit with her rain Of dangerous sweetness. Songs of wild and fierce And energetic things, or low and sweet Eolic tones, but unconnected with Himself, unegotistical, had won Praise and a name for the enthusiast boy. But, with the same intense and constant look With which men gaze within upon their soul, And with a deep expression of devotion, He gazed continually there on oneâ One that knew not his love, but stealthily Uplooked at him, and seemed to him more cold Because she loved him. Oh! the power of love Is terrible upon the poet's heart. The quick and fiery passions there that dwell, And quiver, serpent-like, make too his love As wild, intense, unmingled as themselves. The boy tells not his loveâ Not even when from out his wasting heart The passions will have vent, and he doth breathe His feelings to the worldâthis one remains To feed that heart with its destroying dew. 'T is only when the passions of the soul Have lost some fierceness, and become more tame, Not in the first intense, enthralling gush, That men write down their soul in measured rhyme. After a space, it is some sad relief, To weigh and ponder it in different waysâ To view it in all lightsâin short, to make Poetry of our feelings and our heart. I lose the shadow:âwill its place be filled? Darker and darker the chaotic vast; And now upon its eyeless surface, moves The half-embodied spirit of a dream, Like an unshapen dread upon the soul, A heaviness which hath no visible cause. When will the dream arise from out the chasm, And be revealed?âoh when? I cannot yet Express it to myself. Again the vast Quivers like clouds that are by lightning shaken. And now more clearly I behold the dreamâ The shadow comes distinctly to mine eyes. I see the boy stand in a crowded street: The shade of manhood is upon his lip; His thin form has grown thinner, his dark eyes More deep, more melancholy, more intense. No muscle moves upon his pallid face; His brow contracts not, though its swollen veins Show that the stream of passion or of wo Beats fastly there. Full listlessly he leans Against the pillar of a noble dome, Holding no converse with the crowd; his eyes Look inward, there communing with his spirit. Another shadow rises. Ah! it is That lady of his love; I see her pass By the enthusiast boy: and now I see Him, by the sympathy which doth connect His soul with hers, raise up his dark, sad eyes. They meet his idol. Now his pallid face Is flushed, his frame is shaken, as it were, With a quick agony; the gouts of sweat Stand on his brow. Like one who talks to spirits, His lips part and emit a stifled sound. One sad, mute gesture is his last farewell. The hand of poverty has chilled his hopes, Closed up their rainbow wings, and bid them brood No more upon his heart, to comfort it. Weary of toil and care, he leaves his home, To seek in other climes a fairer lot, And friends less faithless, and a world less cold. He hath not told his love; he hath not asked The idol of his soul to wed with want, And poverty, and painâperhaps remorse. He leaves his home, henceforth to be a leaf, Wandering amid the currents of the air, Or of the trackless seaâa fallen blightâ An aimless wave, that tosses on the ocean, Bearing a star within its heart of love. Gone like the spirit of an echo;âgone Into the shapeless chasm of the soul. But still the cone of one white, glittering star Lightens the dim abyss of memory. Another shadow rises, and behind The wild chaotic darkness waits to whelm That shadow like the rest. I see a desert; And in it is that boy, now grown a man: Strange alterations have been on his soul; His sorrows still are there, but kindly now, Like ancient friends, they people his lone heart. Like shadows round the roots of wasting trees, Feeding them with an influence of love, The sorrows feed his soul, and make it calm. He has communed with nature, in her moods Of stern and silent grandeur, and of sweet And calm contentment, and of bold And barren lonelinessâconversed Most intimately with his wasted heart, And tracked its hidden fountains to their head; And like sick men, that watch their frame decay With strange and silent quietude, so he Has watched those fountains, choked with blighted hopes, Or sublimated unto unseen dew, By passion's constant and devouring fire; Has watched that heart, once verdurous, waste away, Shedding no tear, nor feared to meet with death. Henceforth he hath no hope;âa still despair, A quiet, lone monotony of heart, A strong, unsatiated wish of change, A carelessness and scorn of all mankind, But not a hate, and deep within his heart A love of beauty and of poetryâ This is his nature. I lose the shadow, and the chasmal shades Throng from the void, filling the inner heart. The quivering star of memory is extinct; The echo rings no longer on the sea Of dreams and past realities. So be itâ It is a lesson of another boy, Whom not his crimes or follies, but the tide Of his quick passions ruined. Let, henceforth, None be like him. If ye are born to toil, Wear out your hearts, and let not poetry Enter and nestle there:âit is a curse. Ark. Territory, May 10, 1833. BALLAD, Written on leaving New England. Farewell to thee, New England, Farewell to thee and thine; Farewell to leafy Newbury, And Rowley's woods of pine. Farewell to thee, old Merrimack, Thou deep, deep heart of blue; Oh! could I say, while looking back, That all, like thee, are true! Farewell to thee, old Ocean, Gray father of the waves; Thou, whose incessant motion The wing of ruin braves. Farewell to thee, old Ocean; I'll see thee yet once more, Perhaps, or ere I die, but not Along my own bright shore. Farewell, the White Hills' summer snow, Ascutney's cone of green; Farewell Monadnoc's regal glow, Old Holyoke's emerald sheen. Farewell to hill, and lake, and dell, And each trout-peopled stream, That out of granite rocks doth swell, And ocean-ward doth stream. Farewell to allâboth friends and foesâ To all I leave behind; I think not now of wrong and woes: A long farewell, and kind. I go to liveâperchance to dieâ Unknown, in other climes; A man of many follies I, Perhaps, but not of crimes. I have a pride in thee, my land, Home of the free and brave; Still to thy ancient motto stand, Of âHonor or a grave.â And if I be on ocean tost, Or scorched by burning sun, It still shall be my proudest boast, I am New England's son. So a health to thee, New England, In a parting cup of wine; Farewell to leafy Newbury And Rowley's woods of pine. LINES. [In one month I shall be in the prairie, and under the mountains in another.] Once more unto the desert! who Would live a slave, when he can free His heart from thraldom thus? O who? Slave let him be. Once more unto the desert! now The world's hard bonds have grown too hard. No more, oh heart! in dungeons bow, And caves unstarred. Heart! bid the world farewell: thy task Is done;âperhaps thy words may live;â Thou hast no favor now to ask, And few to give. Thou hast writ down thy thoughts of fire, And deep communion with thine own Sad spirit; now thy broken lyre Makes its last moan. Thou hast laid out thy secrecy Before the world, and traced each wave Of feeling, from thy troubled sea Unto its cave, Within thy dim recesses, where The feelings most intense are hidden; Thou hast outborne thence to the air Thy thoughts, unbidden. And now unto the desert. Why! Am I to be a slave forever? To stay amid mankind, and die Like a scorched river, Wasting in burning sands away? Am I to toil, and watch my heart And spirit, hour by hour decay, Still not depart?â To pour the treasures of my soul Upon the world's parched wilderness, And feel no answering echo roll My ear to bless? Once more unto the desert! There I ask nor wealth, nor hope, nor praise, Nor gentle ease, nor want of care On my dark ways; Nor fame, nor friends, nor joy, nor leisureâ Here I must have them all, or die, Or lead a life devoid of pleasureâ Such now lead I. No life of pain and toil for me! Of home unhoped forâfriends unkind! Better the desert's waveless sea, And stormy wind. Better a life amid the wild Storm-hearted children of the plain, Than this, with heart and soul defiled By sorrow's rain. Out to the desert! from this mart Of bloodless cheeks, and lightless eyes, And broken hopes, and shattered hearts, And miseries. Out to the desert! from the sway Of falsehood, crime, and heartlessness; Better a free life for a day Than years like this. Once more unto the desert, where My gun and steed shall be my friends: And I shall ask no aidance thereâ As little lend. Farewell, my father-land! Afar I make my last and kind farewell. I did think to have seen theeâah! How hopes will swell! Farewell forever! Take the last Sad gift, my father-land, of one Struck by misfortune's chilling blast, Yet still thy son. Farewell, my land! Farewell my pen! Farewell, hard worldâthy harder life! Now to the desert once again! The gun and knife! Ark. Territory May 25, 1833.</field>
