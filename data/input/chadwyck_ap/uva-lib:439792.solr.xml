      <field name="fulltext">âThis is my task: Amid Discordant strife To keep a clean, sweet center in my life, And though the human orchestra may be Playing all out of key, To tune my soul to symphonies above And sound the note of love. This is my task.â âTHIS IS MY TASKâ THIS IS MY TASK When the whole world resounds with rude alarms Of warring arms, When God's good earth, from border unto border, Shows man's disorder, Let me not waste my dower of mortal might In grieving over wrongs I cannot right. This is my task: Amid discordant strife To keep a clean, sweet center in my life, And though the human orchestra may be Playing all out of key, To tune my soul to symphonies above And sound the note of love. This is my task. When, by the minds of men, most beauteous Faith Seems doomed to death, And to her place is hoisted, by soul-treason, The dullard Reason, Let me not hurry forth with flag unfurled To proselyte an unbelieving world. This is my task: In depths of unstarred night Or in diverting and distracting light, To keep (in crowds or in my room alone) Faith on her lofty throne, And whatsoever happen or befall, To see God's hand in all. This is my task. When, in church pews, men worship God in words, But meet their kind with swords, When fair Religion, stripped of holy passion, Walks masked as Fashion, Let me not wax indignant at the sight Or waste my strength bewailing her sad plight. This is my task: To search in my own mind Until the qualities of God I find; To seek them in the heart of friend and foe, Or high or low, And in my hours of toil or prayer or play, To live my creed each day, This is my task. The Superwoman What will the superwoman be, of whom we singâ She who is coming over the dim border Of far To-morrow, after earth's disorder Is tidied up by Time? What will she bring To make life better on tempestuous earth? How will her worth Be greater than her forebears? What new power Within her being will burst into flower? She will bring beauty, not the transient dower Of adolescence which departs with youth, But beauty based on knowledge of the truth Of its eternal message and the source Of its all potent force. Her outer being by the inner thought Shall into lasting loveliness be wrought. She will bring virtue; but it will not be The pale, white blossom of cold chastity Which hides a barren heart. She will be humanâ Not saint or angelâbut the superwoman, Mother and mate and friend of superman. She will bring strength to aid the larger Plan, Wisdom and strength and sweetness all combined. Drawn from the Cosmic Mindâ Wisdom to act, and courage to attain, And sweetness that finds growth in joy or pain. She will bring that large virtue, self-control, And cherish it as her supremest treasure. Not at the call of sense or for Man's pleasure Will she invite from space an embryo soul, To live on earth again in mortal fashion, Unless love stirs her with divinest passion. To motherhood, she will bring common senseâ That most uncommon virtue. She will give Love that is more than she-wolf violence, (Which slaughters others that its own may live), Love that will help each little tendril mind To grow and climb; Love that will know the lordliest use of Time Is training human egos to be kind. She will be formed to guide, but not to leadâ Leaders are ever lonelyâand her sphere Will be that of the comrade and the mate, Loved, loving, and with insight fine and clear, Which casts its search-light on the course of fate. And to the leaders says, âProceedâ or âWait.â And best of all, she will bring holy faith To penetrate the shadowy world of Death, And show the road beyond it, bright and broad. That leads straight up to God. PRAISE DAY Let us halt now for a space in our hurrying Let us take time to look up and look out. Let us refuse for a spell to be worrying; Let us decline both to question or doubt. If one goes caviling Hair splitting, flaw hunting, ready for strife, All the best pleasure is missed in the traveling Onward through life. Just for today we will put away sorrowing Just for today not a tear shall be shed. Nor will we fear anything or go borrowing Pain from the future by profitless dread. Thought shall go frolicking Pleasuring, treasuring, everything bright; Tasting the joy that is found just in rolicking On through the light. Just for today all the ills that need bettering We will omit from our notebook of mind. All that is good we will mark by red lettering; Those things alone we are seeking to find. Things to be sad over, Pine over, whine over, pass them, I say. Nothing is noted save what we are glad overâ This is Praise Day. COMPASSION He was a failure; and one day he died. Across the border of the mapless land He found himself among a sad-eyed band Of disappointed souls: they, too, had tired And missed their purpose. With one voice they cried Unto the shining Angel in command âOh, lead us not before our Lord to stand For we are failures, failures. Let us hide.â Yet on the Angel fared until they stood Before the Master. (Even his holy place The hideous noises of the earth assailed.) Christ reached his arms out to the trembling brood, With God's vast sorrow in his listening face. âCome unto me,â he said, âI, too, have failed.â The Younger Born The modern English-speaking young girl is the astonishment of the world and the despair of the older generation. Nothing like her has ever been seen or heard before. Alike in drawing-rooms and the amusement places of the people, she defies long-established conventions in dress, speech, and conduct. She is bold, yet not immoral. She is immodest, yet she is chaste. She has no ideals, yet she is kind and generous. She is an anomaly and a paradox. We are the little daughters of Time and the World, his wife; We are not like the children born in their younger life; We are marred with our mother's follies and torn with our father's strife. We are the little daughters of the modern World And Time, her spouse. She had brought many children to our father's house Before we came, when both our parents were content With simple pleasures and with quiet, homely ways. Modest and mild Were the fair daughters born to them in those fair days, Modest and mild. But Father Time grew restless and longed for a swifter pace, And our mother pushed out beside him at the cost of her tender grace, And life was no more living, but just a headlong race. And we are wildâ Yea, wild are we, the younger born of the World. Into life's vortex hurled. With the milk of our mother's breast We drank her own unrest, And we learned our speech from Time, Who scoffs at the things sublime. Time and the World have hurried so, They could not help their younger born to grow. We only follow, follow where they go. They left their high ideals behind them as they ran; There was but one goalâpleasure for Woman or for Man, And they robbed the nights of slumber to lengthen the days' brief span. We are the demi-virgins of the modern day; All evil on the earth is known to us in thought, But yet we do it not. We bare our beauteous bodies to the gaze of men; We lure them, tempt them, lead them on, and then Lightly we turn away. By strong, compelling passion we are never stirred: To us it is a wordâ A word much used when tragic tales are told. We are the younger born, yet we are very old In understanding, and our knowledge makes us bold. Boldly we look at life, Loving its stress and strife, And hating all conventions that may mean restraint, Yet shunning sin's black taint. We know wine's taste; And the young-maiden bloom and sweetness of our lips Is often in eclipse, Under the brown weed's stain. Yet we are chaste. We have no large capacity for joy or pain, But an insatiable appetite for pleasure. We have no use for leisure, And never learned the meaning of that word ârepose.â Life, as it goes, Must spell excitement for us, be the cost what may. Speeding along the way, We ofttimes pause to do some generous little deed And fill the cup of need; For we are kind at heart, Though with less heart than head. Unmoral, not immoral, when the worst is said, We are the product of the modern day. We are the little daughters of Time and the World, his wife; We are not like the children born in their younger life; We are marred with our mother's follies and torn with our father's strife. CONTRASTS A great gold sun in the skies above us; A great green world about; Fair winds out, And a blue sea flowing; And boats with white sails coming and going. For the friends we love and the friends who love us, Sing hoâsingâ Life is a goodly thing. (The prison stands against the sky A monument of gloom; The dead are there who did not die Yet dwell within a tomb, If summers come or winters go They do not seem to care, or know; They do not sing, they do not sing.) Birds in the orchard and bees in the clover Rainbows abloom in the sod; Lovers abroad; And somebody singing An old sweet air on taut strings ringing, And off in the woodlands the cry of a lover. Sing ho, I sayâ Life is a holiday. (The Factory offends the airâ With shrill imperious calls; And little children hurrying there Are lost within its walls; It does not matter much someway If bright or dark the outer day. They do not sing, they do not sing.) BELGIUM Ruined? Destroyed? Ah, no; though blood in rivers ran Down all her ancient streets; though treasures manifold, Love-wrought, time-mellowed, and beyond the price of gold Are lost, yet Belgium's star shines still in God's vast plan. Rarely have kings been great, since kingdoms first began; Rarely have great kings been great men when all was told. But, by the lighted torch in mailed hands, behold Immortal Belgium's immortal king, and man. IF I WERE A MAN, A YOUNG MAN If I were a man, a young man and knew what I know today, I would look in the eyes of Life undaunted By any Fate that might threaten me. I would give to the world what the world most wantedâ Manhood that knows it can do and be; Courage that dares, and faith that can see Clear into the depths of the human soul, And find God there, and the ultimate goalâ If I were a man, a young man, and knew what I know today If I were a man, a young man, and knew what I know today, I would think of myself as the masterful creature Of all the masterful plan; The Formless Cause, with form and feature; The Power that heeds not limit or ban; Man, wonderful man. I would do good deeds, and forget them straightway; I would weave my woes into ropes and climb Up to the heights of the helper's gateway; And Life should serve me, and Time, And I would sail out, and out, and find The treasures that lie in that deep sea, Mind. I would dream, and think, and act; I would work, and love, and pray, Till each dream and vision grew into a fact If I were a man, a young man, and knew what I know today. If I were a man, a young man, and knew what I know today, I would guard my passions as Kings guard treasures, And keep them high and clean. (For the will of a man, with his passions measures; It is strong as they are keen.) I would think of each woman as some one's mother; I would think of each man as my own blood brother, And speed him along on his way. And the glory of life in this wonderful hour Should fill me and thrill me with conscious power, If I were a man, a young man and knew what I know today. It May Be Let us be silent for a little while; Let us be still and listen. We may hear Echoes from other worlds not far away. City on city rising, steeple out-topping steeple, Gaining and hoarding and spending, and armies on battle bent, People and people and people, and ever more human peopleâ This is not all of creation, this is not all that was meant! Earth on its orbit spinning, This is not end nor beginning; That is but one of a trillion spheres out into the ether hurled: We move in a zone of wonder, And over our planet and under, Are infinite orders of beings and marvels of world on world. There may be moving among us, curious people and races, Folk of the fourth dimension, folk of the vast star spaces. They may be trying to reach us, They may be longing to teach us Things we are longing to know. If it is so, Voices like these are not heard in earth s riot, Let us be quiet. Classes with classes disputing, nation warring with nation, Building and owning and seeking to leadâthis is not all! Endless the works of creation, There may be waiting our call Beings in numberless legions, Dwellers in rarefied regions, Journeying Godward like us, Alist for a word to be spoken, Awatch for a sign or a token, If it be thus, How they must grieve at our riotous noise And the things we call duties and joys! Let us be silent for a little while; Let us be still and listen. We may hear Echoes from other worlds not far away AN OLD SONG Two roadways lead from This land to That; and one is the road of Prayer; And one is the road of Old Time Songs, and every note is a stair. A shabby old man with a music machine on the sordid city street,â But suddenly earth seemed Arcady, and life grew young and sweet For the city street fled and the world was green and a little house stood by the sea; And she came singing a martial air (she who was peace itself); She brought back with her the old strange charm of mingled pathos and glee; With her eyes of a child in a woman's face and her soul of a saint in an elf. She had been gone for many a year, they tell us it is not far,â That silent place where the dear ones go but it might as well be a star. Yes it might as well be a distant star, as a beautiful Near-By-Land. If we hear no voice, and see no face, and feel no touch of a hand. But now she had come, for I saw her there, and she looked so blithe and young; (Not white and still as I saw her last) and the rose that she wore was red; And her voice soared up in a birdlike trill, at the end of the song she sung, And she mimicked a soldier's warlike stride and tossed back her dear little head. She had been gone for many a year, and never came back before; But I think she dwells in a Near-By-Land since a song jarred open the door; Yes I think it is surely a Near-By-Land, that place where our loved ones are For the song would never have reached her ear had she been on a distant star. Two roadways lead from This land to That; and one is the road of Prayer; And one is the road of Old Time Songs, and every note is a stair. BEAUTY The search for beauty is the search for God, Who is All Beauty. He who seeks shall find; And all along the paths my feet have trod, I have sought hungrily with heart and mind And open eyes for beauty everywhere. Lo! I have found the world is very fair. The search for beauty is the search for God. Beauty was first revealed to me by stars. Before I saw it in my mother's eyes, Or, seeing, sensed it beauty, I was stirred To awe and wonder by those orbs of light, All palpitant against empurpled skies. They spoke a language to my childish heart Of mystery and splendor and of space, Friendly with gracious, unseen presences. Beauty was first revealed to me by stars. Sunsets enlarged the meaning of the word. There was a window looking to the west: Beyond it, wide Wisconsin fields of grain, And then a hill, whereon white flocks of clouds Would gather in the afternoon to rest. And when the sun went down behind that hill, What scenes of glory spread before my sightâ What beautyâbeauty, absolute, supreme! Sunsets enlarged the meaning of that word. Clover in blossom, red and honey-sweet, In summer billowed like a crimson sea Across the meadow lands. One day, I stood Breast-high amidst its waves, and heard the hum Of myriad bees that had gone mad like me With fragrance and with beauty. Over us, A loving sun smiled from a cloudless sky, While a bold breeze kissed lightly as it passed Clover in blossom, red and honey-sweet. Autumn spoke loudly of the beautiful, And in the gallery of Nature hung Colossal pictures hard against the sky, Set forests gorgeous with a hundred hues, And with each morning some new wonder flung Before she startled worldâsome daring shade, Some strange, new scheme of color and of form. Autumn spoke loudly of the beautiful. Winter, though rude, is delicate in artâ More delicate than summer or than fall (Even as rugged Man is more refined In vital things than Woman). Winter's touch On Nature seemed most beautiful of allâ That evanescent beauty of the frost On window-panes, of clean, fresh-fallen snow, Of white, white sunlight on the ice-draped trees. Winter, though rude, is delicate in art. Morning! The word itself is beautiful, And the young hours have many gifts to give That feed the soul with beauty. He who keeps His days for labor and his nights for sleep Wakes conscious of the joy it is to live, And brings from that mysterious Land of Dreams A sense of beauty that illumines earth. Morning! The word itself is beautiful. The search for beauty is the search for God. THE WHITE MAN Wherever the white man's feet have trod (Oh, far does the white man stray) A bold road rifles the virginal sod, And the forest wakes out of its dream of God, To yield him the right of way. For this is the law: By the power of thought, For worse, or for better, are miracles wrought. Wherever the white man's pathway leads, (Far, far hast that pathway gone) The earth is littered with broken creedsâ And always the dark man's tent recedes, And the white man pushes on. For this is the law: Be it good or ill, All things must yield to the stronger will. Wherever the white man's light is shed, (Oh, far has that light between thrown) Though nature has suffered and beauty bled, Yet the goal of the race has been thrust ahead, And the might of the race has grown. For this is the law: Be it cruel or kind, The Universe sways to the power of mind. AFTER Over the din of battle, Over the cannons' rattle, Over the strident voices of men and their dying groans, I hear the falling of thrones. Out of the wild disorder That spreads from border to border, I see a new world rising from ashes of ancient towns; And the Rulers wear no crowns. Over the blood-charged water, Over the fields of slaughter, Down to the hidden vaults of Time, where lie the worn-out things I see the passing of Kings. THE HARP The Harp is dual naturedâHeaven and Earth Are parents of its birth; Heaven, the radiant mother; Earth, the sire Whose unappeased desire Reverberates and rings Along its throbbing strings. In sounds more eloquent than any word The Heavenly Mother speaksâin tender chords And tones that seem the echo from God's lands Of singing choral bands. The Spirit of Celestial music floats Great argosies of soft melodious notes Down the high octaves to their port and goal, The human soul. Then from some deep sea place, where dwells the resonant bass, All suddenly the mortal passions wake And like wind-driven billows, rush and break Upon the heart and flood it with an ocean Of memory and emotion. Ambitions, aspirations, hopes and dreams Past, present, future, swirl in these great streams Of harmony; and over and above Sounds the clear call of love. Into her confidence has Nature taken The wondrous harp; so oft her strings are shaken By voices of the windâ By eerie laughter of the elfin kindâ By ripple of the brooks, by fall of leaves And by the ebbing tide that sighs and grievesâ By whirr of wings at dawnâby that sweet word Uttered in deep wood trysts twixt bird and bird At mating timeâyea all that Nature feels And knows and understands, the Harp reveals. IT MATTERS ONLY Carthage has gone, and Nineveh and Tyre! Yea, thrice has Carthage in the dust been laid. Of other, older, cities, Time has made Dry kindling, for Ambition's funeral pyre. This is the certain end of all desire. Our work must perish and our dreams must fade; Yet do I wake, each morning, undismayed, To dream new dreams, to labor, and aspire. It does not matter that my name must die, My structures fall and nothing leave behind, My best achievements pass away forever; It matters only that immortal I Feel God is in my heart and soul and mind, Urging me on and on to new endeavor. EUROPE Little lads and grandsires, Women old with care; But all men are dying men Or dead men over there. No one stops to dig graves; Who has time to spare? The dead men, the dead men How the dead men stare! Kings are out a-huntingâ Oh, the sport is rare; With dying men and dead men Falling everywhere. Life for lads and grandsires; Spoils for kings to share; And dead men, dead men Dead men everywhere. THE SUITORS There is a little Bungalow, Perched on a granite ledge, And at its feet two suitors meet; (I watch them, and I know) One waits outside the casement edge; One paces to and fro. The Patient Rock speaks not a word; The Sea goes up and down, And sings full oft, in cadence soft; (I listen, and have heard) Again he wears an angry frown By jealous passion stirred. This dawn, the Rock was all aglow; Far out the mad Sea went, Beyond the raft, like one gone daft; (I saw them, and I know) While radiant and well content Smiled down the Bungalow. That was at Dawn; ere day had set, The Sea with pleading voice Came back to woo his love anew; (I saw them when they met) And now I know not which her choiceâ (The Rock's gray face was wet.) OCCUPATION There must in Heaven be many industries And occupations, varied, infinite, Or Heaven could not be Heaven. What gracious tasks The Mighty Maker of the Universe Can offer souls, that have prepared on earth By holding lovely thoughts and fair desires! Art thou a poet to whom words come not! A dumb composer of unuttered sounds, Ignored by fame and to the world unknown? Thine may be, then, the mission to create Immortal lyrics and immortal strains, For stars to chant together as they swing About the holy centre where God dwells. Hast thou the artist instinct with no skill To give it form or color? Unto thee It may be given to paint upon the skies Astounding dawns and sunsets, framed by seas And mountains; or to fashion and adorn New faces for sweet pansies and new dyes To tint their velvet garments. Oftentimes Methinks behind a beauteous flower I see Or in the tender glory of a dawn, The presence of some spirit who has gone Into the Place of Mystery, whose call Imperious and compelling, sounds for all Or soon or late. So many have passed onâ So many with ambitions, hopes and aims Unrealized, who could not be content As idle Angels, even in paradise. The unknown Michael Angelos, who lived With thoughts on beauty bent while chained to toil That gave them only bread and burialâ These must find waiting in the World of Space The shining timbers of their splendid dreams Ready for shaping Temples, Shrines and Towers Where radiant hosts may congregate to raise Their glad hosannas to the God Supreme. And will there not be gardens glorious And Mansions all embosomed among blooms, Where heavenly children reach out loving arms To lonely women who have been denied On earth, the longed for boon of Motherhood? Surely God has provided work to do For souls like these, and for the weary, rest OH, POOR SICK WORLD Lord of all the Universe, when I think of YOU, Flinging stars out into space, moving suns and tides; Then this little mortal mind, gets the larger view; And the carping self of me, runs away and hides. Then I see all shadowed paths, leading out to Light; See the false things fade away, leaving but the True; See the wrong things slay themselves, leaving only Right; When this little mortal mind, gets the larger view. Cavillings at this and that, censure, doubt and fear, Fly, as fly before the dawn, insects of the night; Life and Death are understood; everything seems clear, All the wrong things slay themselves, leaving only Right. The World has walked with fever in its veins For many and many a day. Oh, poor sick World! Not knowing all its dreams of greed and gain Of selfish conquest and possession, were Disordered visions of a brain diseased. Now the World's malady is at its height And there is foul contagion in its breath. It raves of death and slaughter; and the stars Shake with reverberations of its cries, And the sad seas are troubled and dismerged. So must it raveâthis sick and suffering worldâ Until the old secretions in its blood Are emptied out and purged away by war; And the deep seated cankers of the mind Begin the healing process. Then a calm Shall come upon the earth; and that loved word PEACE, shall be understood from shore to shore. Shriek on, mad World. The Great Physician sits Serenely conscious of the coming change, Nor seeks to check the fever; it must run Until its course is finished. He can wait. He feels but pity for His ailing chargeâ Not blame or anger. And He knows the hour Will surely dawn when that sick child shall wake Free from all frenzied fancies, and shall turn Clear-seeing eyes upon the face of God. In His vast Solar Systems He has seen So many other Worlds delirious. Lord of all Universe when I think of YOU, Then this little mortal mind gets the larger view. Then I see all shadowed paths leading into Light, Where the wrong things slay themselves, leaving only Right. Oh, poor sick World! THE WINDS OF FATE One ship drives east and another drives west With the self-same winds that blow; 'Tis the set of the sails And not the gales That tells them the way to go. Like the winds of the sea are the winds of fate As we voyage along through life; 'Tis the set of the soul That decides its goal And not the calm or the strife. America I am the refuge of all the oppressed, I am the boast of the free, I am the harbor where ships may rest Safely 'twixt sea and sea. I hold up a torch to a darkened world, I lighten the path with its ray. Let my hand keep steady And let me be ready For whatever comes my wayâ Let me be ready. Oh, better than fortresses, better than guns, Better than lance or spear, Are the loyal hearts of my daughters and sons, Faithful and without fear. But my daughters and sons must understand That Attila did not die. And they must be ready, Their hands must be steady, If the hosts of hell come nighâ They must be ready. If Jesus were back on the earth with men, He would not preach today Until He had made him a scourge, and again He would drive the defilers away. He would throw down the tables of lust and greed And scatter the changers' gold. He would be ready, His hand would be steady, As it was in that temple of oldâ He would be ready. I am the cradle of God's new world, From me shall the new race rise, And my glorious banner must float unfurled, Unsullied against the skies. My sons and daughters must be my strength, With courage to do and to dare. With hearts that are ready, With hands that are steady, And their slogan must be, Prepare! They must be ready! With a prayer on the lip they must shoulder arms. For after all has been said, We must muster guns, If we master Hunsâ And Attila is not deadâ We must be ready! SONGS OF LOVE AND THE SEA I When first we met (the Sea and I), Like one before a King I stood in awe; nor felt nor saw The sun, the winds, the earth, the sky Or any other thing. God's Universe to me, Was just the Sea. When next we met, the lordly Main Played but a courtier's part; Crowned Queen was I; and earth and sky, And sun and sea were my domain, Since love was in my heart. Before, beyond, above, Was only Love. II Love built me on a little rock, A little house of pine; At first, the Sea Beat angrily About that house of mine; (That dear, dear home of mine). But when it turned to go away Beyond the sandy track, Down o'er its wall The house would call, Until the Sea came back; (It always hurried back). And now the two have grown so fond, (Oh, breathe no word of this), When clouds hang low, And east winds blow, They meet and kiss and kiss; (At night, I hear them kiss). III No man can understand the Sea until He knows all passions of the senses, all The great emotions of the heart, and each Exalted aspiration of the soul. Then may he sit beside the sea and say: âI, too, have flung myself against the rocks, And kissed their flinty brows with no return, And fallen spent upon unfeeling sands. I, too, have gone forth yearning, to far shores, Seeking that something which would bring content, And finding only what I took away; And I have looked up through the veil of skies When all the world was still, and understood That I am one with Nature and with God.â IV The Dawn was flying from the Night; Swift as the wind she sped; Her hair was like a fleece of light; Her cheeks were warm and red. All passion pale, the Night pursued; She fled away, away; And in her garments, rainbow hued, She gained the peak of day. And then, all shaken with alarms, She leaped down from its crest Into the Sea's uplifted arms, And swooned upon his breast. WHAT THEY SAW Sad man, sad man, tell me, pray, What did you see to-day? I saw the unloved and unhappy old waiting for slow, delinquent death to come; Pale little children toiling for the rich, in rooms where sunlight is ashamed to go; The awful almshouse, where the living dead rot slowly in their hideous, open graves. And there were shameful things: Soldiers and forts, and industries of death, and devil-ships, and loud-winged devil-birds, All bent on slaughter and destruction. These and yet more shameful things mine eyes beheld: Old men upon lascivious conquest bent, and young men living with no thought of God, And half-clothed women puffing at a weed, aping the vices of the underworld, Engrossed in shallow pleasures, and intent on being barren wives. These things I saw. (How God must loathe his earth!) Glad man, glad man, tell me, pray, What did you see to-day? I saw an aged couple in whose eyes Shone that deep light of mingled love and faith Which makes the earth one room of paradise And leaves no sting in death. I saw vast regiments of children pour, Rank after rank, out of the schoolroom door, By Progress mobilized. They seemed to say: âLet ignorance make way. We are the heralds of a better day.â I saw the college and the church that stood For all things sane and good. I saw God's helpers in the shop and slum Blazing a path for health and hope to come, And True Religion, from the grave of creeds, Springing to meet man's needs. I saw great Science reverently stand And listen for a sound from Border-land, No longer arrogant with unbelief, Holding itself aloof, But drawing near and searching high and low For that complete and all convincing proof Which shall permit its voice to comfort grief, Saying, âWe know.â I saw fair women in their radiance rise And trample old traditions in the dust, Looking in their clear eyes. I seemed to hear these words as from the skies. âHe who would father our sweet children must Be worthy of the trust.â Against the rosy dawn. I saw unfurled The banner of the race we usher inâ The supermen and -women of the world. Who make no code of sex to cover sin. Before they till the soil of parenthood, They look to it that seed and soil are good. And I saw, too, that old, old, sight, and bestâ Pure mothers with dear babies at the breast, These things I saw. (How God must love his earth!) WE MUST SEND THEM OUT TO PLAY Now much there is need of doing must not be done in haste; But slowly and with patience, as a jungle is changed to a town. But listen, my brothers, listen; it is not always so: When a murderer's hand is lifted to kill, there is no time to waste; And the way to change his purpose is first to knock him down And teach him the law of kindness after you give him the blow. The acorn you plant in the morning will not give shade at noon; And the thornless cactus must be bred by year on year of toil. But listen, my brothers, listen; it is not ever the way, For the roots of the poison ivy plant you cannot pull too soon; If you would better your garden and make the most of your soil, Hurry and dig up the evil things and cast them out today. The ancient sin of the nations no law can ever efface; We must wait for the mothers of men to grow, and give clean souls to their sons. But listen, my brothers, listen; when a child cries out in pain, We must rise from the banquet board and go, though the host is saying grace; We must rise and find the Herod of Greed, who is killing our little ones, Nor ever go back to the banquet until the monster is slain. The strong man waits for justice, with lifted soul and eyes, As a sturdy oak will face the storm and does not break or bow. But listen, my brothers, listen; the child is a child for a day; If a merciless foot treads down each shoot, how can the forest rise? We are robbing the race when we rob a child; we must rescue the children NOW; We must rescue the little slaves of Greed and send them out to play. A Revery in the Station-House Last night I walked along the city street And smiled at men; they saw the ancient sin In my young eyes, and one said, âCome with me.â I went with him, believing my poor purse Would fatten with his gold. He brought me here And turned the key upon me. In an hour, I shall be called before the judge and fined, Because I have solicited. How strange And inexplicable a thing is lawâ How curious its whys, and why-nots! I Was young and innocent of evil thought A few brief years ago. My brother's friend, A social favorite to whom all doors Were open (and a church communicant), Sought me, soliciting my faith and trust, And brushed the dew of virtue from my lips; Then left me to my solitary thoughts. Death and misfortune entered on the scene; I was thrown out to battle with the world, And hide the anguish of a maid deflowered. I left my first employer,âleft because He, too, solicited those favors that No contract mentions, but which seem to be Expected duties by unwritten law In many business-houses. Soon I learned That virtue is, indeed, its own reward. And often finds no other. My poor wage For honest labor and a decent life Scarce kept me fed and sheltered. Everywhere In office, boarding-house, and in church aisles I met the eyes of men soliciting. They supplemented pleading looks by words, And laughed at all my scruples. Finally, The one compelling lover had his way, And when he wearied of me I began The dreary treadmill of the city streets, Soliciting whoever crossed my path To take my favors and to give me gold. Somehow, I cannot seem to understand Why there is law to punish me for that, And none to punish any of the men Who have pursued me with soliciting Right from the threshold of my childhood's home To this grim station-house. My case is called? Well, lead the way, and I will follow you. PAIN'S PURPOSE How blind is he who prays that God will send All pain from earth. Pain has its use and place; Its ministry of holiness and grace. The darker tones upon the canvas blend With light and color; and their shadows lend The painting half its dignity. Efface The sombre background, and you lose all trace Of that perfection which is true art's trend. Life is an artist seeking to reveal God's majesty and beauty in each soul. If from the palette mortal man could steal The precious pigment pair, why then the scroll Would glare with colors meaningless and bright, Or show an empty canvas, blurred with light. LAWNS The roads that from my childhood's home led out, As seasons changed were paved with dust or snow; And in the summer, bordered all about With unkempt grasses, and wild weeds ablow. I can recall the early ride to town, One soft spring morning in the month of May. (The promised purchase of my Sunday gown Lent mystery and glory to the day.) And I recall the feeling even yet, Which stole upon me as we neared the place Where country roads with city pavements met, For there life seemed to show a fairer face. The gala windows of the tempting storeâ The throngs of people moving on and onâ I loved the sight of these; but loved still more The vernal splendor of each close cut lawn. Down to the very street from each abode They stretched their lovely lengths, block after block; A comely contrast to the dusty road And weedy wilds where I was wont to walk. They lay like velvet carpets soft and bright, Spread for the feet of Beauty and Repose. My unformed mind was moved by pure delight, And something sweet and tender in me rose. A vision nebulous and indistinct Lifted my fancy to a world ideal Where earth and fairyland were interlinked And all the âmight be'sâ of this life were real. And where the country places all were towns, With gala windows filled with What-we-Seek; Where little children wore their Sunday gowns And danced on emerald lawns throughout the week. So in her wonderhouse of beauteous wares Which Life has shown to me, a green lawn seems Like tapestries thrown over flights of stairs On which I mounted to my world of dreams. I AM RUNNING FORTH TO MEET YOU I am running forth to meet you, O my Master, For they tell me you are surely on the way; Yes, they tell me you are coming back again (While I run, while I run). And I wish my feet were winged to speed on faster, And I wish I might behold you here today, Lord of men. I am running, yet I walk beside my neighbor, And I take the duties given me to do; Yes, I take the daily duties as they fall (While I run, while I run), And my heart runs with my hand and helps the labor, For I think this is the way that leads to you, Lord of all. I am running, yet I turn from toil and duty, Oftentimes to just the art of being glad; Yes, to just the joys that make the earth-world bright (While I run, while I run). For the soul that worships God must worship beauty, And the heart that thinks of You can not be sad, Lord of Light. I am running, yet I pause to greet my brother, And I lean to rid my garden of its weed; Yes, I lean, although I lift my thoughts above (While I run, while I run). And I think of that command, âLove one another.â As I hear discordant sounds of creed with creed, Lord of Love. I am running, and the road is lit with splendor, And it brightens and shines fairer with each span; Yes, it brightens like the highway in a dream (While I run, while I run). And my heart to all the world grows very tender, For I seem to see the Christ in every man, Lord supreme. HIS LAST LETTER Well, you are free; The longed-for, lied-for, waited-for decree Is yours to-day. I made no protestâand you had your say, And left me with no vestige of repute. âNeglect, abuse, and crueltyâ you charge, With broken marriage-vows. The list was large, But not to be denied. So I was mute. Now you shall listen to a few plain facts Before you go out wholly from my life As some man's wife. Read carefully this statement of your acts Which changed the luster of my honeymoon To somber gloom, And wrenched the cover from Pandora's box. In those first talks 'Twixt bride and groom, I showed you my whole heart; Showed you how deep my love was and how true; With all a strong man's feeling I loved you. (God, how I loved you, my own chosen mate!) But I learned this (So poorly did you play your little part): You married marriageâto avoid the fate Of having âMissâ Carved on your tombstone. Love you did not know; But you were greedy for the showy things That money brings. Such weak affection as you could bestow Was given the provider, not the lover. The knowledge hurt. Keen pain like that is dumb And masks itself in smiles, lest men discover. But I was lonely, and the feeling grew The more I studied you. Into your shallow heart love could not come; But yet you loved my love, because it gave The prowess of a mistress o'er a slave. You showed your power In petty tyranny, hour after hour, Day after day, year after lengthening year; My tasks, my pleasures, my pursuits were not Held near or dear, Or made to seem important in your thought. My friends were not your friends; you goaded me By foolish and ignoble jealousy. Till, through suggestion's laws, I gave you cause. The beauteous ideal love had hung In my soul's shrine, And worshiped as a something all divine, With wanton hand you flung Into the dust. And then you wondered why My love should die. My sins and derelictions cry aloud To all the world. My head is bowed Under its merited reproaches. Yours Is lifted to receive The sympathy the court's decree insures. The world loves to believe In Man's depravity and Woman's worth; But I am one of many men on earth Whose loud, resounding fall Is like the crashing of some well-built wall, Which those who seek can trace To the slow work of insects at its base. Be not afraid; The alimony will be promptly paid. NEUTRAL That pale word âNeutralâ sits becomingly On lips of weaklings. But the men whose brains Find fuel in their blood, the men whose minds Hold sympathetic converse with their hearts, Such men are never neutral. That word stands Unsexed and impotent in Realms of Speech When mighty problems face a startled world No virile man is neutral. Right or wrong His thoughts go forth, assertive, unafraid To stand by his convictions, and to do Their part in shaping issues to an end. Silence may guard the door of useless words, At dictate of Discretion; but to stand Without opinions in a world which needs Constructive thinking, is a coward's part. PEACE SHOULD NOT COME Peace should not come alone this foul earth way, Peace should not come, until we cleanse the earth. God waited for us; now in awful wrath He pours the blood of men out day by day To purify the highroad for her feet. Why, what would Peace do, in a world where hearts, Are filled with thoughts like poison-pointed darts? It were not meet, surely it were not meet For Peace to come, and with her white robes hide These industries of deathâthese guns and swords,â These uniformed, hate-filled, destructive hordes,â These hideous things, that are each nation's pride. So long as men believe in armed might Let arms be brandished. Let not Peace be sought Until the race-heart empties out all thought Of blows and blood, as arguments for Right. The world has never had enough of war. Else war were not. Now let the monster stand Until he slays himself with his own hand; Though no man knows what he is fighting for, Then in the place where wicked cannons stood Let Peace erect her shrine of Brotherhood. HAPPINESS There are so many little things which make life beautiful. I can recall a day in early youth when I was longing for happiness. Toward the western hills I gazed, watching for its approach. The hills lay between me and the setting sun, and over them led a highway. When some traveler crossed the hill, always a fine gray dust rose cloudlike against the sky. The traveler I could not distinguish, but the dust-cloud I could see. And the dust-cloud seemed formed of hopes and possibilitiesâeach speck an embryo event. At sunset, when the skies were fair, the dust-cloud grew radiant and shone with visions. The happiness for which I waited came not to me adown that western slope. But now I can recall the cloud of golden dust, the sunset, and the highway leading over the hill, The wonderful hope and expectancy of my heart, the visions of youth in my eyes; and I know this was happiness. There are so many little things which make life beautiful. I can recall another day when I rebelled at life's monotony. Everywhere about me was the commonplace; and nothing seemed to happen. Each day was like its yesterday, and to-morrow gave no promise of change. My young heart rose rebellious in my breast, and I ran aimlessly into the sunlightâthe glowing sunlight of June. I sent out a dumb cry to Fate, demanding larger joys and more delight. I ran blindly into a field of blooming clover. It was breast-high, and billowed about me like rose-red waves of a fragrant sea. The bees were singing above it; and their little brown bodies were loaded with honey-dew, extracted from the clover blossoms. The sun reeled in the heavens, dizzy with its own splendor. The day went into night, without bringing any new event to change my life. But now I recall the field of blooming clover and the honey-laden bees, the glorious June sunlight and the passion of youth in my heart; and I know that was happiness. There are so many little things which make life beautiful. Yesterday a failure stared me in the face, where I had thought to welcome proud success. There was no radiant cloud of dust against the western sky, and no clover field lying fragrant under mid-June suns; Neither was youth with me any more. But under the vines that clung against my walls, a flock of birds sought shelter just at twilight; And, standing at my casement, I could hear the twitter of their voices and the soft, sweet flutter of their wings. Then over me there fell a sense of peace and calm, and love for all created things, and trust illimitable. And that, I knew, was happiness. There are so many little things which make life beautiful. JUST YOU All the selfish joys of earth I am getting through. That which used to lure and lead Now I pass and give no heed; Only one thing seems of worthâ Just you. Not for me the lonely height, And the larger view; Lowlier ways seems fair and wide, While we wander side by side. One thing makes the whole world brightâ Just you. Not for distant goals I run, No great aim pursue; Most of earth's ambitions seem Like the shadow of a dream. All the world to me means oneâ Just you. MY FAITH My faith is rooted in no written creed; And there are those, who call me heretic; Yet year on year, though I be well, or sick, Or opulent, or in the slough of need, If, light of foot, fair Life trips by me pleasuring, Or, by the rule of pain, old Time stands measuring The dull drab momentsâstill ascends my cry âGod reigns on high; He doeth all things well.â Not much I prize, or one, or any brand Of theologic lore; nor think too well Of generally accepted heaven and hell. But faith and knowledge build at Love's command A beauteous heaven; a heaven of thought all clarified Of hate, and fear, and doubt; a heaven of rarified And perfect trust; and from that heaven I cry âGod reigns on high. Whatever is, is best.â My faith refuses to accept the â fall,â It sees man ever as a child of God Growing in wisdom as new realms are trod Until the Christ in him is One with All. From this full consciousness my faith is borrowing Light to illuminate Life's darkest sorrowing. Whatever woes assail me still I cry âGod reigns on high; He doeth all things wellâ My faith finds prayer the language of the heart Which gives us converse with the hosts unseen; And those who linger in the vales between The Here and Yonder in these prayers take part. My dead come near, and say, âDeath means not perishing; Cherish us in your thoughts; for by that cherishing Shall severed links be welded bye and bye.â God reigns on high; Whatever is, is best. War Mothers In the old times of peace we went our ways, Through proper days Of little joys and tasks. Lonely at times, When from the steeple sounded wedding-chimes, Telling to all the world some maid was wife; But taking patiently our part in life As it was portioned us by Church and State, Believing it our fate. Our thoughts all chaste Held yet a secret wish to love and mate Ere youth and virtue should go quite to waste. But men we criticized for lack of strength, And kept them at arm's length. Then the war cameâ The world was all aflame! The men we had thought dull and void of power Were heroes in an hour. He who had seemed a slave to petty greed Showed masterful in that great time of need. He who had plotted for his neighbor's pelf. Now for his fellows offered up himself. And we were only women, forced by war To sacrifice the things worth living for. Something within us broke; Something within us woke; The wild cave-woman spoke. When we heard the sound of drumming, As our soldiers went to camp, Heard them tramp, tramp, tramp; As we watched to see them coming, And they looked at us and smiled (Yes, looked back at us and smiled) As they filed along by hillock and by hollow, Then our hearts were so beguiled That, for many and many a day, We dreamed we heard them say, âOh, follow, follow, follow!â And the distant, rolling drum Called us, âCome, come, come!â Till our virtue seemed a thing to give away. There is something in the sound of drum and fife That wakes all the savage instincts into life. War had swept ten thousand years away from earth. We were primal once again. These were males, not modern men; We were females meant to bring their sons to birth. And we could not wait for any formal rite. We could hear them calling to us. âCome to-night; For to-morrow, at the dawn, We move on!â And the drum Bellowed, âCome, come, come!â And the fife Whistled, âLife, life, life!â So they moved on and fought and bled and died; Honored and mourned, they are the nation's pride. We fought our battles, too; but with the tide Of our red blood we gave the world new lives. Because we were not wives We are dishonored. Is it noble, then, To break God's laws only by killing men To save one's country from destruction? We Took no man's life but gave our chastity. And sinned the ancient sin To plant young trees and fill felled forests in. O clergy of the land, Bible in hand, All reverently you stand, On holy thoughts intent, While barren wives receive the sacrament! Had you the open vision you could see Phantoms of infants murdered in the womb Who never knew a cradle or a tomb Hovering about these wives accusingly. Bestow the sacrament! Their sins are not well knownâ Ours to the four winds of the earth are blown. THE TRIP TO MARS Oh! by and by we shall hear the cry. âThis is the way to Mars.â Come take a trip, on the morning Ship; It sails by the Isle of Stars. âA glorious view of planets new We promise by night and day. Past dying suns our good ship runs, And we pause at the Milky Way.â I am almost sure we will take that tour Together, my dear, my dear. For, ever have we, by land and sea, Gone journeying far and near. Out over the deepâo'er mountain steep, We have traveled mile on mile; And to sail away to the Martian Bay, Oh! that were a trip worth while. Our ship will race through seas of space Up into the Realms of Light, Till the whirling ball of the earth grows small, And is utterly lost to sight. Through the nebulous spawn where planets are born We shall pass with sails well furled, And with eager eyes we will scan the skies, For the sights of a new-made world. From the derelict barque of a sun gone dark, Adrift on our fair ship's path, A beacon star shall guide us afar, And far from the comet's wrath. Oh! many a start of pulse and heart We have felt at the sights of land. But what would we do if the dream came true, And we sighted the Martian strand? So, if some day you come and say, âThey are sailing to Mars, I hear.â I want you to know, I am ready to go,â All ready, my dear, my dear. EARTH BOUND New Paradise and groom and bride; The World was all their own; Her heart swelled full of love and pride; Yet were they quite alone? âNow how is it, oh how is it, and why is it.â (in fear All silent to herself she spake) âthat something strange seems here?â Along the garden paths they walked; The moon was at its height. And lover-wise they strolled and talked; But something was not right. And âWho is that, now who is that, oh who is thatâ quoth she (All silent to her heart she spake), âthat seems to follow me?â He drew her closer to his side; She felt his lingering kiss; And yet a shadow seemed to glide Between her heart and his. And âWhat is that, now what is that, oh what is that,â she said (All silent to herself she spake), âthat minds me of the dead?â They wandered back by beds of bloom; They climbed a winding stair; They crossed the threshold of their room; But Something waited there. âNow who is this, and what is this, and where is this,â she cried (All silent was the cry she made), âthat comes to haunt and hide?â Wide-eyed she lay, the while he slept; She could not name her fear. But Something from her bedside crept Just as the dawn drew near. (She did not know, she could not know, how could she know who came To haunt the home of one whose hand, had dug her grave of shame.) A Son Speaks Mother, sit down, for I have much to say Anent this wide-spread, ever-growing theme Of Woman and her virtues and her rights. I left you for the large, loud world of men, When I had lived one little score of years. I judged all women by you, and my heart Was filled with high esteem and reverence For your angelic sex; and for the wives, The sisters, daughters, mothers of my friends I held but holy thoughts. To fallen stars (Of whom you told me in our last sweet talk, Warning me of the dangers in my path) I gave wide pity as you bade me to, Saying their sins harked back to my base sex. Now, listen, mother mine: Ten years have passed Since that clean-minded and pure-bodied youth, Thinking to write his name upon the stars, Went from your presence. He returns to you Fallen from his high altitude of thought, Hiding deep scars of sins upon his soul, His fair illusions shattered and destroyed. And would you know the story of his fall? He sat beside a good man's honored wife At her own table. She was beautiful As woods in early autumn. Full of soft And subtle witcheries of voice and lookâ His senior, both in knowledge and in years. The boyish admiration of his glance Was white as April sunlight when it falls Upon a blooming tree, until she leaned So close her rounded body sent quick thrills Along his nerves. He thought it accident And moved a little; soon she leaned again. The half-hid beauties of her heaving breast Rising and falling under scented lace; The teasing tendrils of her fragrant hair. With intermittent touches on his cheek, Changed the boy's interest to the man's desire. She saw that first young madness in his eyes. Smiled, and fanned the flame. That was his fall: And as some mangled fly may crawl away And leave his wings behind him in the web, So were his wings of faith in womanhood Left in the meshes of her sensuous net. The youth, forced into sudden manhood, went Seeking the lost ideal of his dreams. He met, in churches and in drawing-rooms, Women who wore the mask of innocence And basked in public favor, yet who seemed To find their pleasure playing with men's hearts, As children play with loaded guns. He heard (Until the tale fell dull upon his ears) The unsolicited complaints of wives And mothers all unsatisfied with life While crowned with every blessing earth can give. Longing for God knows what to bring content; And openly or with appealing look Asking for sympathy. (The first blind step That leads from wifely honor down to shame Is ofttimes hid with flowers of sympathy.) He saw proud women who would flush and pale With sense of outraged modesty if one Spoke of the ancient sin before them, bare To all men's sight, or flimsily conceal By veils that bid adventurous eyes proceed. Charms meant alone for lover and for child. He saw chaste virgins tempt and tantalize. Lure and deny, inviteâand then refuse, And drive men forth, half crazed, to wantons' arms. Mother, you taught me there were but two kinds Of women in the worldâthe good and bad. But you have been too sheltered in the safe. Old-fashioned sweetness of your quiet life To know how women of these modern days Make license of their new-found liberty. Why, I have been more tempted and more shocked By belles an beauties in the social whirl, By trusted wives and mothers in their homes, Than by the women of the underworld Who sell their favors. Do you think me mad? No, mother; I am sane, but very sad. I miss my boyhood's faith in Woman's worthâ Torn from my heart by âgood folksâ of the earth. KIM Kim, in that tender canine heart of yours What faithfulness endures. What sterling qualities of loyal friend And fearless comrade blend, Making you strong to rescue and defend. In you we find The quick perception of a thinking mind, Keen understanding, cheerfulness and tact, And love so vast it permeates each act. Often we cannot think of you as dumb, But feel that speech must come From that too silent lip, Adding the last touch to companionship. Lifting your shaggy locks and looking down Into your eyes of brown, Something I see that makes me more and more Doubt that religious lore, That orthodox, unyielding lore, which gives No spark of soul to anything that lives Save biped man. Why Kim in your dear eyes There lies The chief foundation of man's Paradiseâ Unquestioning, undoubting love, and faith That would walk bravely through the gates of death, If so your Master or your Mistress led. When all is said It is of love and faith we build our Heavenâ Dear Kim I cannot question that you will be given Your green celestial lawn, your astral sea, And life with him and me Yea, life with him and me, Since we to you are what God is to us. And oh! to love God thus! With such supreme devotion to obey And ask no reason why; by night or day To have no will or choice, But just to follow the Beloved Voice. To trust implicitlyâto feel no fear Or discontent or doubt since He is near. Let me look deeper, Kim, in your dear heart; Impart To me that fulness of unquestioning love That I may give my God thereof. THE GHOSTS There was no wind, and yet the air Seemed suddenly astir; There were no forms, and yet all space Seemed thronged with growing hosts. They came from Where and from Nowhere. Like phantoms as they were. They came from many a land and placeâ The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts. And some were white and some were gray And some were red as bloodâ Those ghosts of men who met their death Upon the field of war. Against the skies of fading day, Like banks of clouds they stood; And each wraith asked another wraith, âWhat were we fighting for?â One said, âI was my mother's all: And she was old and blind.â Another, âBack on earth, my wife And week-old baby lie.â Another, âAt the bugle's call, I left my bride behind; Love made so beautiful my life, I could not bear to die.â In voices like the winds that moan Among pine trees at night, They whispered long, the newly dead, While listening stars came out. âWe wonder if the cause is known, And if the war was right, That killed us in our prime,â they said. âAnd what it was about.â They came in throngs that filled all spaceâ Those whispering phantom hosts. They came from many a land and placeâ The ghosts, the ghosts, the ghosts. HERESY Nothing within me responds to the story of Adam and Eve; And Genesis seems like a tale not meant for the world to believe: Yet when I wake in the dawn, if the skies are gray or gold, The love, the love in the heart of me, for God, can never be told. Jesus to me is a man who lived the life divine; And I think of his birth as a human birth, just like yours and mine! But the love down deep in my heart, that is sweeter than any other. Is the great uplifting, tender love I give to Christ, my brother. I know at times I have erred, as all who are mortal will; By doing the wrong thing well, or doing the right thing ill: But nobody else can atone for the paths my feet have trod; And I know, I know by the love in my heart, I can make it right with God. The world has a thousand creeds, and never a one have I; Nor church of my own, though a million spires are pointing the way on high. But I float on the bosom of faith that bears me along like a river; And the lamp of my soul is alight with love, for life, and the world, and the Giver. I know how brief is my span, and I know how certain is death; And I send out a prayer of love and trust with the breathing of every breath; And heretic though I am outside of the pale of creeds, I have love in my heart for God and manâand I think it is all one needs. The Crimes of Peace Musing upon the tragedies of earth, Of each new horror which each hour gives birth. Of sins that scar and cruelties that blight Life's little season, meant for man's delight. Methought those monstrous and repellent crimes Which hate engenders in war-heated times. To God's great heart bring not so much despair As other sins which flourish everywhere And in all timesâbold sins, bare-faced and proud. Unchecked by college, and by Church allowed. Lifting their lusty heads like ugly weeds Above wise precepts and religious creeds. And growing rank in prosperous days of peace Think you the evils of this world would cease With war's cessation? If God's eyes know tears. Methinks he weeps more for the wasted years And the lost meaning of this earthly lifeâ This big, brief lifeâthan over bloody strife. Yea; there are mean, lean sins God must abhor More than the fatted, blood-drunk monster. War. Looking from his place, looking from his high place among the stars. God saw a peaceful landâ A land of fertile fields and golden harvestsâand great cities whose innumerable spires pierced the vault of heaven, like bayonets of an invading army. And God said, speaking unto himself aloud. God said: âPeace and power and plenty have I given unto this land; and those tall steeples are monuments to me. Now let my people reveal themselves, that I may see their works, done in my name in a fertile land of peace. I will withdraw mine eyes from other worlds that I may behold them, that I may behold these people to whom I sent Christâthey whose innumerable spires pierce my blue vault like bayonets.â God saw the restless, idle rich in club and cabaret. Meat-gorged, wine-filled, they played preened and danced till dawn o day; They played at sports; they played at love; they played at being gay. They were but empty, silk-clad shells; their souls had leaked away. He saw the sweat-shop and the mill where little children toiled, The sunless rooms where mothers slaved and unborn souls were spoiled; While those whose greedy, selfish lives had thrust the toilers there, He saw whirled down broad avenues, clothed all with raiment fair. He saw in homes made beautiful with all that gold can give Unhappy souls at odds with life, not knowing how to live. He saw fair, pampered women turn from motherhood's sweet joy, Obsessed with methods to prevent or mania to destroy. He saw men sell their souls to vice and avarice and greed; He heard race quarreling with race and creed decrying creed, And shameful wealth and waste he saw, and shameful want and need. He saw bold little children come from church and school-room, blind To suffering of lesser things, unfeeling and unkind; He heard them taunt the poor, and tease their furred and feathered kin; And no voice spake from home or church, to tell them this was sin. He heard the cry of wounded things. the wasteful gun's report; He saw the morbid craze to kill, which Christian men called sport. And then God hid his grieving face behind a wall of cloud, On earth they said, âA thunder-stormââbut God had wept aloud. A SONG OF FAITH My glass of life with its brew of Being, I lift, with a toast, to the Universe. Though black guns bellow and mad men curse And a sick world hurries from bad to worse I trust in the might of the One All Seeingâ The One All Knowing, to set things right. Though hate in the heart of the race may thunder, In rifle and cannon and bursting shell, And the sea and the air their tales may tell, Of the minds of mortals that seethe with hell,â Yet in God's vast plan there can be no blunderâ He is blazing the trail for the Super-man. The creeds of ages may totter and tumble, And fall in ruins, but out of the dust, And out of the wreckage of old things, must Rise better religion, and stronger trust, And faith that knows, and knowing is humble. (Humility ever with knowledge goes.) This speck in space on its orbit spinning, Swings safely along without aid from me, A Mind that can order, an Eye that can see, Back of, and over it all must beâ And will beâand was from the first beginning, Not mine to question or doubt the Cause. But mine to worship the Mighty Master And Maker of all things; mine to raise Ever an anthem of love and praise In the light of the sun or in shadowed ways,â In the world's bright hour, or in world disaster, To see His glory and sing His power. So my glass of life with its brew of Being I lift, with a song of the One All Seeingâ Of the One All Knowing; though earth seems hurled Out into chaos, I see it lying In God's great palmâand my faith undying Cries, âLo! He is moulding a better world.â A GOOD SPORT I was a little lad, and the older boys called to me from the pier. They called to me: âBe a sport; be a sport! Leap in and swim!â I leaped in and swam, though I had never been taught a stroke. Then I was made a hero, and they all shouted: âWell done! Well done, Brave boy; you are a sport, a good sport!â And I was very glad. But now I wish I had learned to swim the right way, Or had never learned at all. Now I regret that day, For it led me to my fall. I was a youth, and I heard the older men talking of the road to wealth, They talked of bulls and bears, of buying on margins, And they said: âBe a sport, my boy; plunge in and win, or lose it all! It is the only way to fortune.â So I plunged in and won; and the older men patted me on the back, And they said, âYou are a sport, my boy, a good sport!â And I was very glad But now I wish I had lost all I ventured on that dayâ Yes, wish I had lost it all: For it was the wrong way, And pushed me to my fall. I was a young man, and the gay world called me to come. Gay women and gay men called to me, crying: âBe a sport; be a good sport! Fill our glasses and let us fill yours. We are young but once; let us dance and sing, And drive the dull hours of night until they stand at bay Against the shining bayonets of day.â So I filled my glass, and I filled their glasses over and over again, And I sang and danced and drank, and drank and danced and sang, And I heard them cry, âHe is a sport, a good sport!â As they held their glasses out to be filled again. And I was very glad. Oh, the madness of youth and song and dance and wine, Of woman's eyes and lips, when the night dies in the arms of down! And now I wish I had not gone that way. Now I wish I had not heard them say, âHe is a sport, a good sport!â For I am old who should be young. The splendid vigor of my youth I flung Under the feet of a mad, unthinking throng. My strength went out with wine and dance and song; Unto the winds of earth I tossed like chaff, With idle jest and laugh, The pride of splendid manhood, all its wealth Of unused power and health; Its dream of looking in some pure girl's eyes And finding there its earthly paradise; Its hope of virile children free from blight; Its thoughts of climbing to some noble height Of great achievementâall these gifts divine I cast away for song and dance and wine. Oh, I have been a sport, a good sport; But I am very sad. A BACHELOR TO A MARRIED FLIRT All that a man can say of woman's charms, Mine eyes have spoken and my lips have told To you a thousand times. Your perfect arms, (A replica from that lost Melos mould) The fair, firm crescents of your bosom (shown With full intent to make their splendors known.) Your eyes (that mask with innocence their guile), The (artful) artlessness of all your ways, Your kiss-provoking mouth, its lure, its smile, All these have had my fond and frequent praise. And something more than praise to you I gaveâ Something which made you know me as your slave. Yet slaves at times grow mutinous, and rebel, Here in this morning hour from you apart The mood is on me to be frank and tell The thoughts long hidden deep down in my heart: These thoughts are bitter thorny plants, that grew Below the flowers of praise I plucked for you. Those flowery praises, led you to suppose You were my benefactor. Well, in truth When lovely woman on dull man bestows Sweet favors of her beauty and her youth, He is her debtor, I am yours; and yet You robbed me while you placed me thus in debt. I owe you for keen moments when you stirred My senses with your beauty; when your eyes, (Your wanton eyes) belied the prudent word Your curled lips uttered. You are worldly wise And while you like to set men's hearts on flame You take no risks in that old passion game. The carnal, common self of dual me, Found pleasure in this danger play of yours. (An egotist man always thinks to be The victor if his patience but endures, And holds in leash the bounds of fierce desire, Until the silly woman's heart takes fire.) But now it is the Higher Self who speaks: The Me of meâthe inner manâthe realâ Who ever dreams his dream and ever seeks To bring to earth his beautiful ideal. That life-long dream with all its promised joy Your soft bedevilments have helped destroy. Woman, how can I hope for happy life In days to come at my own nuptial hearth, When you who bear the honored name of wife So lightly hold the dearest gifts of earth? Descending from your pedestal, alas! You shake the pedestals of all your class. A vain, flirtatious wife, is like a thief Who breaks into the temple of men's souls, And steals the golden vessels of belief The swinging censers, and the incense bowls. All women seem less loyal and less true, Less worthy of men's faith since I met you. A WAFT OF PERFUME A waft of perfume from a bit of lace, Moved lightly by a passing woman's hand; And on the common street, a sensuous grace Shone suddenly from some lost time and land. Tall structures changed to dome and parapet; The stern faced Church an oracle became; In sheltered alcoves, marble busts were set; And on the wall, frail Lais wrote her name. Phryne before her judges stood at bay, Fearing the rigor of Athenian laws; Till Hyperides tore her cloak away And bade her splendid beauty plead its cause. Great Alexander walking in the dusk, Dreamed of the hour when Greek with Greek should meet; From Thais' window, attar breathed, and musk; His footsteps went no farther down the street. Faint and more faint, the pungent perfume grew; Of wall and parapet, remained no trace. Temple and statue vanished from the view The city street again was commonplace. SEPARATION He One decade and a half since first we came With hearts aflame, Into Love's paradise, as man and mate; And now we separate. Soon, all too soon Waned the white splendor of our honeymoon. We saw it fading, but we did not know How bleak the path would be when once its glow Was wholly gone. And yet we two were forced to travel onâ Leagues, leagues apart while ever side by side. Darker and darker grew the loveless weather, Darker the way, Until we could not stay Longer together. Now that all anger from our hearts has died, And love has flown far from its ruined nest To find sweet shelter in another breast, Let us talk calmly of our past mistakes And of our faultsâif only for the sakes Of those with whom our futures will be cast: You shall speak first. She A woman would speak lastâ Tell me my first grave error as a wife. He Inertia. My young veins were rife With manhood's ardent blood, and love was fire Within me But you met my strong desire With lips like frozen rose leavesâchaste, so chaste, That all your splendid beauty seemed but waste Of Love's materials. Then of that beauty Which had so pleased my sight, You seemed to take no care: you felt no duty To keep yourself an object of delight For lover-eyes; and appetite And indolence soon wrought Their devastating changes. You were not The woman I had sworn to love and cherish, If love is starved, what can love do but perish? Now, will you speak of my first fatal sin And all that followed, even as I have done? She I must begin With the young quarter of our honeymoon. You are but one Of countless men who take the priceless boon Of woman's love and kill it at the start, Not wantonly but blindly. Woman's passion Is such a subtle thingâwoof of her heart, Web of her spirit; and the body's part Is to play ever but the lesser rÃ´le To her white soul. Seized in brute fashion, It fades like down on wings of butterflies; Then dies. So my love died. Next, on base Mammon's cross you nailed my pride, Making me ask for what was mine by right; Until, in my own sight, I seemed a helpless slave To whom the master gave A grudging dole. Oh, yes, at times gifts showered Upon your chattel; but I was not dowered By generous love. Hate never framed a curse Or placed a cruel ban That so crushed woman, as the law of man That makes her pensioner upon his purse. That necessary stuff called gold is such A cold, rude thing it needs the nicest touch Of thought and speech when it approaches Love, Or it will prove the certain death thereof. He Your words cut deep; 'tis time we separate. She Well, each goes wiser to a newer mate. AN UNFAITHFUL WIFE TO HER HUSBAND Branded and blackened by my own misdeeds I stand before you; not as one who pleads For mercy or forgiveness, but as one, After a wrong is done, Who seeks the why and wherefore. Go with me Back to those early years of love, and see Just where our paths diverged. You must recall Your wild pursuit of me, outstripping all Competitors and rivals, till at last You bound me sure and fast With vow and ring. I was the central thing In all the Universe for you just then. Just then for me, there were no other men. I cared Only for tasks and pleasures that you shared. Such happy, happy days. You wearied first. I will not say you wearied, but a thirst For conquest and achievement in man's realm Left love's barque with no pilot at the helm. The money madness, and the keen desire To outstrip others, set your heart on fire. Into the growing conflagration went Romance and sentiment. Abroad you were a man of parts and powerâ Your double dower Of brawn and brains gave you a leader's place; At home you were dull, tired, and commonplace. You housed me, fed me, clothed me; you were kind; But oh, so blind, so blind. You could not, would not, see my woman's need Of small attentions; and you gave no heed When I complained of loneliness; you said âA man must think about his daily bread And not waste time in empty social lifeâ He leaves that sort of duty to his wife And pays her bills, and lets her have her way, And feels she should be satisfied.â Each day Our lives that had been one life at the start, Farther and farther seemed to drift apart. Dead was the old romance of man and maid. Your talk was all of politics or trade. Your work, your club, the mad pursuit of gold Absorbed your thoughts. Your duty kiss fell cold Upon my lips. Life lost its zest, its thrill, Until One fateful day when earth seemed very dull It suddenly grew bright and beautiful. I spoke a little, and he listened much; There was attention in his eyes, and such A note of comradeship in his low tone, I felt no more alone. There was a kindly interest in his air; He spoke about the way I dressed my hair, And praised the gown I wore. It seemed a thousand, thousand years and more Since I had been so noticed. Had mine ear Been used to compliments year after year, If I had heard you speak As this man spoke, I had not been so weak. The innocent beginning Of all my sinning Was just the woman's craving to be brought Into the inner shrine of some man's thought. You held me there, as sweetheart and as bride; And then as wife, you left me far outside. So far, so far, you could not hear me call; You might, you should, have saved me from my fall. I was not bad, just lonely, that was all. A man should offer something to replace The sweet adventure of the lover's chase Which ends with marriage, Love's neglected laws Pave pathways for the âStatutory Cause.â THE MEN-MADE GODS Said the Kaiser's god to the god of the Czar: âHark, hark, how my people pray. Their faith, methinks, is greater by far Than all the faiths of the others are; They know I will help them slay.â Said the god of the Czar: âMy people call In a medley of tongues; they know I will lend my strength to them one and all. Wherever they fight their foes shall fall Like grass where the mowers go.â Then the god of the Gauls spoke out of a cloud To the god of the king nearby; âOur people pray, tho' they pray not loud; They ask for courage to slaughter a crowd, And to laugh, tho' themselves may die.â And far out into the heart of space Where a lonely pathway crept Up over the stars, to a secret place, Where no light shone but the light of His face, Christ covered his eyes and wept. REPLIES You have lived long and learned the secret of life, O Seer! Tell me what are the best three thing to seekâ The best three things for a man to seek on earth? The best three things for a man to seek, O Son! are these: Reverence for that great source from whence he came; Work for the world wherein he finds himself, And knowledge of the realm toward which he goes. What are the best three things to love on earth, O Seer!â What are the best three things for a man to love? The best three things for a man to love, O Son! are these: Labor which keeps his forces all in action; A home wherein no evil thing may enter, And a loving woman with God in her heart. What are the three great sins to shun, O Seer!â What are the three great sins for a man to shun? The three great sins for a man to shun, O Son! are these: A thought which soils the heart from whence it goes; An action which can harm a living thing, And undeveloped energies of mind. What are the worst three things to fear, O Seer!â What are the worst three things for a man to fear? The worst three things for a man to fear, O Son! are these: Doubt and suspicion in a young child's eyes; Accusing shame upon a woman's face, And in himself no consciousness of God. MY FLOWER ROOM My Flower Room is such a little place; Scarce twenty feet by nine; yet in that space I have met God, yea, many a radiant hour Have talked with Him, and All-Embracing-Cause, About his laws. And He has shown me in each vine and flower Such miracles of power That day by day this Flower Room of mine Has come to be a shrine. Fed by the self-same soil and atmosphere Pale, tender shoots appear Rising to greet the light in that sweet room. One speeds to crimson bloom, One slowly creeps to unassuming grace; One climbs, one trails; One drinks the light and moisture, One exhales. Up through the earth together, stem by stem Two plants push swiftly in a floral race, Till one sends forth a blossom like a gem, And one gives only fragrance. In a seed So small it scarce is felt within the hand, Lie hidden such delights Of scents and sights, When by the elements of Nature freed, As Paradise must have at its command. From shapeless roots and ugly bulbous things What gorgeous beauty springs! Such infinite variety appears A hundred artists in a hundred years Could never copy from the floral world The marvels that in leaf and bud lie curled. Nor could the most colossal mind of man Create one little seed of plant or vine Without assistance from the First Great Plan; Without the aid divine. Who but a God Could draw from light and moisture, heat and cold, And fashion in earth's mold A multitude of blooms to deck one sod? Who but a God! Not one man knows Just why the bloom and fragrance of the rose, Or how its tints were blent; Or why the white Camelia without scent Up through the same soil grows; Or how the daisy and the violet And blades of grass first on wild meadows met; Not one, not one man knows. The wisest but SUPPOSE. This Flower Room of mine Has come to be a shrine; And I go hence Each day with larger faith and reverence. The Convention From the Queen Bee mother, the mother Beast, and the mother Fowl in the fen, A call went up to the human world, to Woman, the mother of men. The call said, âCome; for we, the dumb, are given speech for a day, And the things we have thought for a thousand years we are going, at last, to say.â Much they marveled, these women of earth, at the strange and curious call, And some of them laughed and some of them sneered, but they answered it one and all, For they wanted to hear what never before was heard since the world beganâ The spoken word of Beast and Bird, and the message it held for Man. âA plea for shelter,â the women said, âor food in the wintry weathers, Or a foolish request that we be dressed without their furs or feathers. We will do what we can for the poor dumb things, but they must be sensible.â Then The meeting was called, and a she bear stood and voiced the thought of the fen. âNow this is the message we give to youâ (it was thus the she bear spake) âYou, the creatures of homes and shrines, and we of the wold and brake. We have no churches; we have no schools, and our minds you question and doubt, But we follow the laws which some Great Cause, alike for us all, laid out. âWe eat and we drink to live; we shun the things that poison and kill; And we settle the problems of sex and birth by the law of the female will, For never was one of us known by a male, or made to mother its kind, Unless there went from our minds consent (or from what we call the mind). âBut you, the highest of all she things, you gorge yourselves at your feasts, And you smoke and drink in a way we think would lower the standard of beasts; For a ring and a roof and a rag you are bought by your males, to have and to hold; And you mate and you breed without nature's need, while your hearts and your bodies are cold. âAll unwanted your offspring come, or you slay them before they are born, And now we wild she things of the earth have spoken and told our scorn. We have no minds and we have no souls, maybe as you thinkâand still, Never one of us ate or drank the things that poison and kill, And never was one of us known by a male except by our wish and will.â THE BLASPHEMY of GUNS There must be lonely moments when God feels The need of prayerâ Such lonely moments, knowing not any where. In any spot or place, In all the far recesses of vast space, Dwells anyone to whom His prayers may rise, And then, methinksâso urgent is His needâ God bids His prayers descend. He that has ears to hear, let him take heed, For much God's prayers portend. God flings His solar system forth to be Finished by beings who befit each sphere. Not ours to pry the secrets out of Mars: Our work lies here. To star-folk, leave the stars. There must be many worlds that give God care: Young worlds that glow and burn, Old worlds that freeze and fade. This world is man's concern. Methinks God must be very much dismayed. Seeing the use we make of earth to-day. While loud we pray. Last night, in sleep, beyond the earth's small zone, Adventurously my spirit went alone, Past lesser hells and heavens, where souls may pause To learn the meaning of death's larger laws, Past astral shapes and bodies of desire, Past angels and archangels, high and higher, Until the pinnacles of space it trod, Then, awestruck, paused, hearing the voice of God. âMortals of earth, for whom I shaped a sphere (So spake the Voice), âthere rises to mine ear Eternal praises and eternal pleas. Now, after centuries, I tire of these. Have ye no knowledge of the Maker's needs, Ye who ask favors and who praise by creeds? Why has it not sufficed That unto this small earth I sent great Christ. Divine expression of the mortal man To aid my plan? âWhy ask for more when all has been refused? Why praise my name who hourly am abused? Why seek for Me or heaven, when in you dwells Hate's lurid hells? âPersistent praises and persuasive pleasâ I tire, I tire of these But I, the Maker of a billion suns, Ask men to stop the blasphemy of guns.â This is God's prayer. (There must be many worlds that give God care.) A RAINY NIGHT When the fingers of rain on the window pane Tap, tap, tap, And the feet of the rain run over the roof In the dark of a summer night, Then out of their graves old memories creep And they steal up into the house of sleep And they rap, rap, rap On the door of the heart till it sets a light And opens the portal and spreads the board For the waiting horde. Then the great wide world seems all astir With the ghostly shapes of the things that were. A Pleasure that perished, a dead Despair, An old Delight and a vanished Care, A Passion that builded its funeral pyre, From the worthless timber of brief desire, A Hope that wandered and lost its way In the dazzling beams of its own bright ray, With long gone Worries and long lost Joys Come stealthily creeping with never a noise (For the things that have gone on the road to God, When they turn back earthward are silence-shod); And they enter the heart's great living room When the rain beats down from a sky of gloom In the dark of a summer night. And they tell old tales and they sing old songs That are sweet, sweet, sweet; While the fingers of rain on the window pane Beat, beat, beat. And they feast on the past and drink its wine And call it a brew divine. But when in the east the darkness pales And the edge of the clouds show light, The ghosts go back with a silent tread And only the heart knows what they said In the dark of the summer night. REWARD Fate used me meanly; but I looked at her and laughed, That none might know how bitter was the cup I quaffed. Along came Joy, and paused beside me where I sat, Saying, âI came to see what you were laughing at.â</field>
