      <field name="fulltext">CANADA England, father and mother in one, Look on your stalwart son. Sturdy and strong, with the valour of youth, Where is another so lusty? Coated and mailed, with the armour of truth, Where is another so trusty? Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone, He is yours alone. England, father and mother in one, See the wealth of your son. Forests primeval, and virginal sod, Wheat-fields golden and splendid: Riches of nature and opulent God For the use of his children intended. A courage that dares, and a hope that endures, And a soul all yours. England, father and mother in one, Hear the cry of your son. Little cares he for the glories of earth Lying around and above him, Yearning is he for the rights of his birth, And the heart of his mother to love him. Vast are your gifts to him, ample his store, Now open your door. England, father and mother in one, Heed the voice of your son. Proffer him place in your councils of state: Let him sit near, and attend you. Ponder his words in the hour of debate, Strong is his arm to defend you. Flesh of your flesh, and bone of your bone, Give him his own. CORONATION POEM AND PRAYER The world has crowned a thousand kings: But destiny has kept Her weightiest hour of kingly power To offer England's son. The rising bell of Progress rings; And Truths which long have slept, Like prophets strange, predicting change, Before Time's chariot run. The greatest Empire of the Earth. Old England proudly stands. Like arteries her Colonies Reach out from sea to sea. She clasps all races in her girth; Her gaze the world commands; And far and wide where strong ships ride, The British Flag floats free. Oh, never since the stars began Their round of Cosmic law, And souls evolved in ways unsolved, And kingdoms reached their prime Has Destiny held out to Man A gift so full of awe, As England's crown which she hands down In this stupendous time. This is a crucial hour, when Fate Tries Monarchs as by fire. All rulers must be more than just— Men starve on bread alone. Old England's sense of right is great; But now let her aspire To feel more love, and build thereof An everlasting Throne. The dreaming East, awake at last, Is asking ‘when’ and ‘why’; Wait not too long nor answer wrong, Nor in too stern a voice. Let England profit by her past, And with her wise reply Rouse hearts, within her foster kin To hope, and to rejoice. True wealth dwells not in things we own, But in our use of things. Who would command a conquered land Must conquer first its heart. Such might as Man has never known, And power undreamed by kings, And boundless strength would come at length To one who used that art. For now has dawned the People's day: A day of great unrest. Nor king nor creed can still man's need Of time and space to grow. All lands must shape a wider way, For this eternal quest; And Leisure yield a larger field Where work-worn feet may go. The Universe is all a-thrill With changes imminent. The World in faith, with bated breath, Holds free the Leader's place. And wise is he whose heart and will At one with Time's intent, Shall open wide doors long denied To mothers of the race. On this round globe, oh, when and where Were fitter time and scene For Woman's soul to reach its goal Than now in England's realm. Was not the crown its King will wear Made glorious by its Queen? And who steered straight its ship of State? Victoria at the Helm! Kings have been kings by accident, By favour and by force, But right of birth and moral worth, And Empires rich and broad For England's King to-day are blent Like rivers on one course. But, ah! the light falls searching white Down from the Throne of God. Lord of the Earth and heavenly spheres, Creator of all things, Thou who hast wrought great worlds from naught, Give strength to England's son. Give courage to dispel those fears That come to even kings, And for his creed give Love's full mead; Amen. Thy Will be done. THE TRUTH TELLER The Truth Teller lifts the curtain, And shows us the people's plight; And everything seems uncertain, And nothing at all looks right. Yet out of the blackness groping, My heart finds a world in bloom; For it somehow is fashioned for hoping, And it cannot live in the gloom. He tells us from border to border, That race is warring with race; With riot and mad disorder, The earth is a wretched place; And yet ere the sun is setting I am thinking of peace, not strife; For my heart has a way of forgetting All things save the joy of life. I heard in my Youth's beginning That earth was a region of woe, And trouble, and sorrow, and sinning: The Truth Teller told me so. I knew it was true, and tragic; And I mourned over much that was wrong; And then, by some curious magic, The heart of me burst into song. The years have been going, going, A mixture of pleasure and pain; But the Truth Teller's books are showing That evil is on the gain. And I know that I ought to be grieving, And I should be too sad to sing; But somehow I keep on believing That life is a glorious thing. ACQUAINTANCE Not we who daily walk the City's street; Not those who have been cradled in its heart, Best understand its architectural art, Or realise its grandeur. Oft we meet Some stranger who has stayed his passing feet And lingered with us for a single hour, And learned more of cathedral, and of tower, Than we, who deem our knowledge quite complete. Not always those we hold most loved and dear, Not always those who dwell with us, know best Our greater selves. Because they stand so near They cannot see the lofty mountain crest, The gleaming sun-kissed height, which fair and dear Stands forth—revealed unto the some-time guest. THE LITTLE LADY OF THE BULLOCK CART Now is the time when India is gay With wedding parties; and the radiant throngs Seem like a scattered rainbow taking part In human pleasures. Dressed in bright array, They fling upon the bride their wreaths of songs— The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart. Here is the temple ready for the rite: The large-eyed bullocks halt; and waiting arms Lift down the bride. All India's curious art Speaks in the gems with which she is bedight, And in the robes which hide her sweet alarms— The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart. This is her day of days: her splendid hour When joy is hers, though love is all unknown. It has not dawned upon her childish heart. But human triumph, in a temporal power, Has crowned her queen upon a one-day throne— The Little Lady of the Bullock Cart. Ah, Little Lady! What will be your fate? So long, so long, the outward-reaching years: So brief the joy of this elusive part; So frail the shoulders for the loads that wait: So bitter salt the virgin widow's tears— O Little Lady of the Bullock Cart. EAST AND WEST The Day has never understood the Gloaming or the Night; Though sired by one Creative Power, and nursed at Nature's breast; The White Man ever fails to read the Dark Man's heart aright; Though from the self-same Source they came, upon the self-same quest; So deep and wide, the Great Divide, Between the East and West. But like a shadow on a screen, mine eyes behold, above The yawning gulf, a dim forecast, of structures strong and broad; Where caste, and colour prejudice, by countless feet down trod, With old traditions crushed by Time, pave smooth the bridge of Love; And all the creed that men shall heed Is consciousness of God. THE SQUANDERER God gave him passions, splendid as the sun, Meant for the lordliest purposes; a part Of nature's full and fertile mother heart, From which new systems and new stars are spun. And now, behold, behold, what he has done! In Folly's court and carnal Pleasures' mart He flung the wealth life gave him at the start. (This, of all mortal sins, the deadliest one.) At dawn he stood, potential, opulent, With virile manhood, and emotions keen, And wonderful with God's creative fire. At noon he stands, with Love's large fortune spent In petty traffic, unproductive, mean— A pauper, cursed with impotent desire. COMPENSATIONS I BLIND When first the shadows fell, like prison bars, And darkness spread before me, like a pall, I cried out for the sun, the earth, the stars, And beat the air, as madmen beat a wall, Till, impotent, and broken with despair, I turned my vision inward. Lo, a spark— A light—a torch; and all my world grew bright; For God's dear eyes were shining through the dark. Then, bringing to me gifts of recompense, Came keener hearing, finer taste, and touch; And that oft unappreciated sense, Which finds sweet odours, and proclaims them such; And not until my mortal eyes were blind Did I perceive how kind the world, how kind. II DEAF I can recall a time, when on mine ears There fell chaotic sounds of earthly life, Shrill cries of triumph, and hoarse shouts of strife; A medley of despairs, and hopes and fears. Then silence came, and unavailing tears. The stillness stabbed me, like a two edged-knife; Until I found the Universe was rife With subtle music of the neighbouring spheres. Such harmonies, such congruous sweet chords, Wherein each note conveys a healing balm. And now no more I miss men's spoken words; For, in a quiet world of larger thought, I know the joy that comes from being calm. III SHUT-IN Across my window glass The moving shadows of the people pass. Sometimes the shadows pause; and through the hall Kind neighbours come to call, Bringing a word or smile To cheer my loneliness a little while. But as I hear them talk, These people who can walk And go about the great green earth at will, I wonder if they know the joy of being still, And all alone with thoughts that soar afar— High as the highest star. And oft I feel more free Than those who travel over land and sea. For one who is shut in, Away from all the outer strife and din, With faithful Pain for guide, Finds where Great Truths abide. Across my window glass The moving shadows pass. But swifter moves my unimpeded thought, Speeding from spot to spot— Out and afar— High as the highest star. ALWAYS AT SEA Always at sea I think about the dead. On barques invisible they seem to sail The self-same course; and from the decks cry ‘Hail’! Then I recall old words that they have said, And see their faces etched upon the mist— Dear faces I have kissed. Always the dead seem very close at sea. The coarse vibrations of the earth debar Our spirit friends from coming where we are. But through God's ether, unimpeded, free, They wing their way, the ocean deeps above— And find the hearts that love. Always at sea my dead come very near. A growing host; some old in spirit lore, And some who crossed to find the other shore But yesterday. All, all, I see and hear With inner senses, while the voice of faith Proclaims—there is no death. THE JEALOUS GODS Oh life is wonderful,’ she said, ‘And all my world is bright; Can Paradise show fairer skies, Or more effulgent light?’ (Speak lower, lower, mortal heart, The jealous gods may hear.) She turned for answer; but his gaze Cut past her like a lance, And shone like flame on one who came With radiant glance for glance. (You spoke too loud, O mortal heart, The jealous gods were near.) They walked through green and sunlit ways; And yet the earth seemed black, For there were three, where two should be; So runs the world, alack. (The listening gods, the jealous gods, They want no Edens here.) GOD RULES ALWAY Into the world's most high and holy places Men carry selfishness, and graft and greed. The air is rent with warring of the races; Loud Dogmas drown a brother's cry of need. The Fleet-of-Creeds, upon Time's ocean lurches; And there is mutiny upon her decks; And in the light of temples, and of churches, Against life's shores drift wrecks and derelicts. (God rules, God rules alway.) Right in the shadow of the lofty steeple, Which crowns some costly edifice of faith, Behold the throngs of hungry, unhoused people; The ‘Bread Line,’ flanked by charity and death. See yonder Churchman, opulently doing Unnumbered deeds, which gladden and resound; The while his thrifty tenant is pursuing The white slave trade on sacred, untaxed ground. (God rules, God rules alway.) For these are but the outward signs of fever; Those flaunting signs, which through delirium burn; And the clear-seeing eye of each Believer Can note the coming crisis. It will turn, For it has reached its summit. Convalescing, The sick world shall arise to strength and peace, And earth shall bloom, with each and every blessing Life waits to give, when wars and conflicts cease. (God rules, God rules alway.) This is a mighty hour. No sounds of drumming, No flying flags, no heralds do appear; No Wise Men of the East proclaim His coming; Yet He is coming—nay, our Christ is here! And man shall leave his fever dreams behind him; Those dreams of avarice, and lust, and sin, And seek his Lord; yea, he shall seek and find Him, In his own soul, where He has always been. (God rules, God rules alway.) Man longs for God. Before the Christ we wot of, With His brief mighty message, came to earth, Before His life, or creed, or cross were thought of, The love of love within man's breast had birth. But blindly, through his carnal senses reaching, He plucked dead fruit, and nothing has sufficed; Nor can his soul find rest in any teaching, Until he knows that he, himself, is Christ. (God rules, God rules alway.) Oh, when he knows this truth in all its splendour, What majesty, what glory crowns his life: And, one with God, his every thought is tender; He cannot enter into war, or strife. His love goes out to every race and nation; His whole religion lies in being kind. This is the creed that means the world's salvation; The birth of christ in every mortal mind. (God rules, God rules alway.) SCIENCE Alone I climb the steep ascending path Which leads to knowledge. In the babbling throngs That hurry after, shouting to the world Small fragments of large truths, there is not one Who comprehends my purpose, or who sees The ultimate great goal. Why, even she, My heaven intended Spouse, my other self, Religion, turns her beauteous face on me With hatred in the eyes, where love should dwell. While those who call me Master blindly run, Wounding the ear of Faith with blasphemies, And making useless slaughter in my name. Mine is the difficult slow task to blaze A road of Facts, through labyrinths of dreams To tear down Maybe and establish IS: And substitute I Know for I Believe. I follow closely where the Seers have led: But that intangible dim path of theirs, Which may be trodden but by other Seers, I seek to render solid for the feet Of all mankind. With reverent hands I lift The mask from Mystery: and show the face Of Reason, smiling bravely on the world. The visions of the prophets, one by one, Grew visible beneath my tireless touch: And the white secrets of elusive stars I tell aloud, to listening multitudes. To fit the better world my toil ensures, Time will impregnate with a better race The Future's womb: and when the hour is ripe, To ready eyes of men, the alien spheres Shall seem as friendly neighbours: and my skill Shall make their music audible to ears Which will be tuned to those high harmonies. Mine is the work to fashion, step by step, The shining Way that leads from man to God. Though I demolish obstacles of creeds And blast tradition, from the face of earth, My hand shall open wide the door of Truth, Whose other name is Faith: and at the end Of this most holy labour, I shall turn To see Religion, with enlightened eyes, Seeking the welcome of my outstretched arms. While all the world stands hushed and awed before The proven splendour of the Fact Supreme. THE MUSE AND THE POET The Muse said, Let us sing a little song Wherein no hint of wrong, No echo of the great world need, or pain, Shall mar the strain. Lock fast the swinging portal of thy heart; Keep sympathy apart. Sing of the sunset, of the dawn, the sea; Of any thing or nothing, so there be No purpose to thy art. Yea, let us make, art for Art's sake. And sing no more unto the hearts of men, But for the critic's pen. With songs that are but words, sweet sounding words, Like joyous jargon of the birds. Tune now thy lyre, O Poet, and sing on. Sing of THE DAWN The Virgin Night, all languorous with dreams Of her belovèd Darkness, rose in fear, Feeling the presence of another near. Outside her curtained casement shone the gleams Of burning orbs; and modestly she hid Her brow and bosom with her dusky hair. When lo! the bold intruder lurking there Leaped through the fragile lattice, all unbid, And half unveiled her. Then the swooning Night Fell pale and dead, while yet her soul was white Before that lawless Ravisher, the Light. The Muse said, Poet, nay; thou hast not caught My meaning. For there lurks a thought Back of thy song. In art, all thought is wrong. Re-string thy lyre; and let the echoes bound To nothing but sweet sound. Strike now the chords And sing of WORDS One day sweet Ladye Language gave to me A little golden key. I sat me down beside her jewel box And turned its locks. And oh, the wealth that lay there in my sight. Great solitaires of words, so bright, so bright; Words that no use can commonize; like God, And Truth, and Love; and words of sapphire blue; And amber words; with sunshine dripping through; And words of that strange hue A pearl reveals upon a wanton's hand. Again the Muse: Thou dost not understand; A thought within thy song is lingering yet. Sing but of words; all else forget, forget. Nor let thy words convey one thought to men. Try once again. Down through the dusk and dew there fell a word; Down through the dew and dusk. And all the garments of the air it stirred Smelled sweet as musk; And all the little waves of air it kissed Turned gold and amethyst. There in the dew and dusk a heart it found; There in the dusk and dew The sodden silence changed to fragrant sound; And all the world seemed new. Upon the path that little word had trod, There shone the smile of God. The Muse said, Drop thy lyre. I tire, I tire. ‘THE TAVERN OF LAST TIMES’ (AT BOX HILL, SURREY) A modern hour from London (as we spin Into a silver thread the miles of space Between us and our goal), there is a place Apart from city traffic, dust, and din, Green with great trees, where hides a quiet Inn. Here Nelson last looked on the lovely face Which made his world; and by its magic grace Trailed rosy clouds across each early sin. And, leaning lawnward, is the room where Keats Wrote the last one of those immortal songs (Called by the critics of his day ‘mere rhymes’). A lark, high in the boxwood bough repeats Those lyric strains, to idle passing throngs, There by the little Tavern-of-Last-Times. FORWARD Let me look always forward. Never back. Was I not formed for progress? Otherwise With onward pointing feet and searching eyes Would God have set me squarely on the track Up which we all must labour with life's pack? Yonder the goal of all this travel lies. What matters it, if yesterday the skies With light were golden, or with clouds were black? I would not lose to-morrow's glow of dawn By peering backward after sun's long set. New hope is fairer than an old regret; Let me pursue my journey and press on— Nor tearful eyed, stand ever in one spot, A briny statue like the wife of Lot. KARMA I We cannot choose our sorrows. One there was Who, reverent of soul, and strong with trust, Cried, ‘God, though Thou shouldst bow me to the dust, Yet will I praise thy everlasting laws. Beggared, my faith would never halt or pause, But sing Thy glory, feasting on a crust. Only one boon, one precious boon I must Demand of Thee, O opulent great Cause. Let Love stay with me, constant to the end, Though fame pass by and poverty pursue.’ With freighted hold her life ship onward sailed; The world gave wealth, and pleasure, and a friend, Unmarred by envy, and whose heart was true. But ere the sun reached midday, Love had failed. II Then from the depths, in bitterness she cried, ‘Hell is on earth, and heaven is but a dream; And human life a troubled aimless stream; And God is nowhere. Would God so deride A loving creature's faith?’ A voice replied, ‘The stream flows onward to the Source Supreme, Where things that ARE replace the things that SEEM, And where the deeds of all past lives abide. Once at thy door Love languished and was spurned. Who sorrow plants, must garner sorrow's sheaf. No prayers can change the seedling in the sod. By thine own heart Love's anguish must be learned. Pass on, and know, as one made wise by grief, That in thyself dwells heaven and hell and God.’ PETITION God, may Thy loving Spirit work, In heart of Russian, and of Turk, Until throughout each clime and land, Armenian and Jew may stand, And claim the right of every soul To seek by its own path, the goal. Parts of the Universal Force, Rills from the same eternal Source Back to that Source, all races go. God, help Thy world to see it so. GO PLANT A TREE God, what a joy it is to plant a tree, And from the sallow earth to watch it rise, Lifting its emerald branches to the skies In silent adoration; and to see Its strength and glory waxing with each spring. Yes, 'tis a goodly, and a gladsome thing To plant a tree. Nature has many marvels; but a tree Seems more than marvellous. It is divine. So generous, so tender, so benign. Not garrulous like the rivers; and yet free In pleasant converse with the winds and birds; Oh! privilege beyond explaining words, To plant a tree. Rocks are majestic; but, unlike a tree, They stand aloof, and silent. In the roar Of ocean billows breaking on the shore There sounds the voice of turmoil. But a tree Speaks ever of companionship and rest. Yea, of all righteous acts, this, this is best, To plant a tree. There is an oak (oh! how I love that tree) Which has been thriving for a hundred years; Each day I send my blessing through the spheres To one who gave this triple boon to me, Of growing beauty, singing birds, and shade. Wouldst thou win laurels that shall never fade? Go plant a tree. OLD RHYTHM AND RHYME They tell me new methods now govern the Muses, The modes of expression have changed with the times; That low is the rank of the poet who uses The old-fashioned verse with intentional rhymes. And quite out of date, too, is rhythmical metre; The critics declare it an insult to art. But oh! the sweet swing of it, oh! the clear ring of it, Oh! the great pulse of it, right from the heart, Art or no art. I sat by the side of that old poet, Ocean, And counted the billows that broke on the rocks; The tide lilted in with a rhythmical motion; The sea-gulls dipped downward in time-keeping flocks. I watched while a giant wave gathered its forces, And then on the gray granite precipice burst; And I knew as I counted, while other waves mounted, I knew the tenth billow would rhyme with the first. Below in the village a church bell was chiming, And back in the woodland a little bird sang; And, doubt it who will, yet those two sounds were rhyming, As out o'er the hill-tops they echoed and rang. The Wind and the Trees fell to talking together; And nothing they said was didactic or terse; But everything spoken was told in unbroken And a beautiful rhyming and rhythmical verse. So rhythm I hail it, though critics assail it, And hold melting rhymes as an insult to art, For oh! the sweet swing of it, oh! the dear ring of it, Oh! the strong pulse of it, right from the heart, Art or no art.</field>
