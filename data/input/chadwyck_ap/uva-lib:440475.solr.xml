      <field name="fulltext">WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF THIS PLODDING LIFE Within the circuit of this plodding life There enter moments of an azure hue, Untarnished fair as is the violet Or anemone, when the spring strews them By some meandering rivulet, which make The best philosophy untrue that aims But to console man for his grievances. I have remembered when the winter came, High in my chamber in the frosty nights, When in the still light of the cheerful moon, On every twig and rail and jutting spout, The icy spears were adding to their length Against the arrows of the coming sun, How in the shimmering noon of summer past Some unrecorded beam slanted across The upland pastures where the Johnswort grew; Or heard, amid the verdure of my mind, The bee's long smothered hum, on the blue flag Loitering amidst the mead; or busy rill, Which now through all its course stands still and dumb Its own memorial,âpurling at its play Along the slopes, and through the meadows next, Until its youthful sound was hushed at last In the staid current of the lowland stream; Or seen the furrows shine but late upturned, And where the fieldfare followed in the rear, When all the fields around lay bound and hoar Beneath a thick integument of snow. So by God's cheap economy made rich To go upon my winter's task again. HIS STEADY SAILS HE NEVER FURLS His steady sails he never furls At any time o' year, And perching now on Winter's curls, He whistles in his ear. SOMETIMES I HEAR THE VEERY'S CLARION Sometimes I hear the veery's clarion, Or brazen trump of the impatient jay, And in secluded woods the chicadee Doles out her scanty notes, which sing the praise Of heroes, and set forth the loveliness Of virtue evermore. UPON THE LOFTY ELM TREE SPRAYS Upon the lofty elm tree sprays The vireo rings the changes sweet, During the trivial summer days, Striving to lift our thoughts above the street. THOU DUSKY SPIRIT OF THE WOOD Thou dusky spirit of the wood, Bird of an ancient brood, Flitting thy lonely way, A meteor in the summer's day, From wood to wood, from hill to hill, Low over forest, field and rill, What wouldst thou say? Why shouldst thou haunt the day? What makes thy melancholy float? What bravery inspires thy throat, And bears thee up above the clouds, Over desponding human crowds, Which far below Lay thy haunts low? THE RIVER SWELLETH MORE AND MORE The river swelleth more and more, Like some sweet influence stealing o'er The passive town; and for a while Each tussuck makes a tiny isle, Where, on some friendly Ararat, Resteth the weary water-rat. No ripple shows Musketaquid, Her very current e'en is hid, As deepest souls do calmest rest, When thoughts are swelling in the breast, And she that in the summer's drought Doth make a rippling and a rout, Sleeps from Nahshawtuck to the Cliff, Unruffled by a single skiff. But by a thousand distant hills The louder roar a thousand rills, And many a spring which now is dumb, And many a stream with smothered hum, Doth swifter well and faster glide, Though buried deep beneath the tide. Our village shows a rural Venice, Its broad lagoons where yonder fen is; As lovely as the Bay of Naples Yon placid cove amid the maples; And in my neighbor's field of corn I recognise the Golden Horn. Here Nature taught from year to year, When only red men came to hear, Methinks 'twas in this school of art Venice and Naples learned their part, But still their mistress, to my mind, Her young disciples leaves behind. GREAT GOD, I ASK THEE FOR NO MEANER PELF Great God, I ask thee for no meaner pelf Than that I may not disappoint myself, That in my action I may soar as high, As I can now discern with this clear eye. And next in value, which thy kindness lends, That I may greatly disappoint my friends, Howe'er they think or hope that it may be, They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me. That my weak hand may equal my firm faith, And my life practice more than my tongue saith; That my low conduct may not show, Nor my relenting lines, That I thy purpose did not know, Or overrated thy designs. THE MOON Time wears her not; she doth his chariot guide; Mortality below her orb is placed. âRaleigh. The full-orbed moon with unchanged ray Mounts up the eastern sky, Not doomed to these short nights for aye, But shining steadily. She does not wane, but my fortune, Which her rays do not bless, My wayward path declineth soon, But she shines not the less. And if she faintly glimmers here, And paled is her light, Yet alway in her proper sphere She's mistress of the night. TO A STRAY FOWL Poor bird! destined to lead thy life Far in the adventurous west, And here to be debarred to-night From thy accustomed nest; Must thou fall back upon old instinct nowâ Well nigh extinct under man's fickle care? Did heaven bestow its quenchless inner light So long ago, for thy small want to-night? Why stand'st upon thy toes to crow so late? The moon is deaf to thy low feathered fate; Or dost thou think so to possess the night, And people the drear dark with thy brave sprite? And now with anxious eye thou look'st about, While the relentless shade draws on its veil, For some sure shelter from approaching dews, And the insidious steps of nightly foes. I fear imprisonment has dulled thy wit, Or ingrained servitude extinguished it. But noâdim memory of the days of yore, By Brahmapootra and the Jumna's shore, Where thy proud race flew swiftly o'er the heath, And sought its food the jungle's shade beneath, Has taught thy wings to seek yon friendly trees, As erst by Indus' banks and far Ganges. THE SLUGGISH SMOKE CURLS UP FROM SOME DEEP DELL The sluggish smoke curls up from some deep dell, The stiffened air exploring in the dawn, And making slow acquaintance with the day; Delaying now upon its heavenward course, In wreathed loiterings dallying with itself, With as uncertain purpose and slow deed, As its half-wakened master by the hearth, Whose mind still slumbering and sluggish thoughts Have not yet swept into the onward current Of the new day;âand now it streams afar, The while the chopper goes with step direct, And mind intent to swing the early axe. First in the dusky dawn he sends abroad His early scout, his emissary, smoke, The earliest, latest pilgrim from the roof, To feel the frosty air, inform the day; And while he crouches still beside the hearth, Nor musters courage to unbar the door, It has gone down the glen with the light wind, And o'er the plain unfurled its venturous wreath, Draped the tree tops, loitered upon the hill, And warmed the pinions of the early bird; And now, perchance, high in the crispy air, Has caught sight of the day o'er the earth's edge, And greets its master's eye at his low door, As some refulgent cloud in the upper sky. WHEN WINTER FRINGES EVERY BOUGH When Winter fringes every bough With his fantastic wreath, And puts the seal of silence now Upon the leaves beneath; When every stream in its pent-house Goes gurgling on its way, And in his gallery the mouse Nibbleth the meadow hay; Methinks the summer still is nigh, And lurketh underneath, As that same meadow mouse doth lie Snug in the last year's heath. And if perchance the chicadee Lisp a faint note anon, The snow in summer's canopy, Which she herself put on. Fair blossoms deck the cheerful trees, And dazzling fruits depend, The north wind sighs a summer breeze, The nipping frosts to fend, Bringing glad tidings unto me, The while I stand all ear, Of a serene eternity, Which need not winter fear. Out on the silent pond straightway The restless ice doth crack, And pond sprites merry gambols play Amid the deafening rack. Eager I hasten to the vale, As if I heard brave news, How nature held high festival, Which it were hard to lose. I gambol with my neighbor ice, And sympathizing quake, As each new crack darts in a trice Across the gladsome lake. One with the cricket in the ground, And faggot on the hearth, Resounds the rare domestic sound Along the forest path. NOT UNCONCERNED WACHUSETT REARS HIS HEAD Not unconcerned Wachusett rears his head Above the field, so late from nature won, With patient brow reserved, as one who read New annals in the history of man. THE OLD MARLBOROUGH ROAD Where they once dug for money, But never found any; Where sometimes Martial Miles Singly files, And Elijah Wood, I fear for no good: No other man, Save Elisha Dugan,â O man of wild habits, Partridges and rabbits, Who hast no cares Only to set snares, Who liv'st all alone, Close to the bone, And where life is sweetest Constantly eatest. When the spring stirs my blood With the instinct to travel, I can get enough gravel On the Old Marlborough Road. Nobody repairs it, For nobody wears it; It is a living way, As the Christians say. Not many there be Who enter therein, Only the guests of the Irishman Quin. What is it, what is it, But a direction out there, And the bare possibility Of going somewhere? Great guide-boards of stone, But travellers none; Cenotaphs of the towns Named on their crowns. It is worth going to see Where you might be. What king Did the thing, I am still wondering; Set up how or when, By what selectmen, Gourgas or Lee, Clark or Darby? They're a great endeavor To be something forever; Blank tablets of stone, Where a traveller might groan, And in one sentence Grave all that it known; Which another might read, In his extreme need. I know one or two Lines that would do, Literature that might stand All over the land, Which a man could remember Till next December, And read again in the spring, After the thawing. If with fancy unfurled You leave your abode, You may go round the world By the Old Marlborough Road. IN TWO YEARS' TIME 'T HAD THUS In two years' time 't had thus Reached the level of the rocks, Admired the stretching world, Nor feared the wandering flocks. But at this tender age Its sufferings began: There came a browsing ox And cut it down a span. CARPE DIEM Build not on to-morrow, But seize on to-day! From no future borrow, The present to pay. Wait not any longer Thy work to begin; The worker grows stronger,â Be steadfast and win! Forbode not new sorrowâ Bear that of to-day, And trust that the morrow Shall chase it away. The task of the present Be sure to fulfil; If sad, or if pleasant, Be true to it still. God sendeth us sorrow And cloudeth our day; His sun on the morrow Shines bright on our way. EACH SUMMER SOUND Each summer sound Is a summer round. THE NEEDLES OF THE PINE The needles of the pine, All to the west incline. IN THE EAST FAMES ARE WON In the East fames are won, In the West deeds are done. LOVE EQUALS SWIFT AND SLOW Love equals swift and slow, And high and low, Racer and lame, The hunter and his game. MEN SAY THEY KNOW MANY THINGS Men say they know many things; But lo! they have taken wings,â The arts and sciences, And a thousand appliances; The wind that blows Is all that any body knows. WHAT'S THE RAILROAD TO ME What's the railroad to me? I never go to see Where it ends. It fills a few hollows, And makes banks for the swallows, It sets the sand a-blowing, And the blackberries a-growing, IT IS NO DREAM OF MINE It is no dream of mine, To ornament a line; I cannot come nearer to God and Heaven Than I live to Walden even. I am its stony shore, And the breeze that passes o'er; In the hollow of my hand Are its deepest resort Lies high in my thought. LIGHT-WINGED SMOKE, ICARIAN BIRD Light-winged Smoke, Icarian bird, Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight, Lark without song, and messenger of dawn, Circling above the hamlets as thy nest; Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts; By night star-veiling, and by day Darkening the light and blotting out the sun; Go thou my incense upward from this hearth, And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame. DIE AND BE BURIED WHO WILL Die and be buried who will, I mean to live here still; My nature grows ever more young The primitive pines among. WHERE'ER THOU SAIL'ST WHO SAILED WITH ME Where'er thou sail'st who sailed with me, Though now thou climbest loftier mounts, And fairer rivers dost ascend, Be thou my Muse, my Brotherâ. I AM BOUND, I AM BOUND, FOR A DISTANT SHORE I am bound, I am bound, for a distant shore, By a loney isle, by a far Azore, There it is, there it is, the treasure I seek, On the barren sands of a desolate creek. I SAILED UP A RIVER WITH A PLEASANT WIND I sailed up a river with a pleasant wind, New lands, new people, and new thoughts to find; Many fair reaches and headlands appeared, And many dangers were there to be feared; But when I remember where I have been, And the fair landscapes that I have seen, THOU seemest the only permanent shore, The cape never rounded, nor wandered o'er. THE RESPECTABLE FOLKS The respectable folks,â Where dwell they? They whisper in the oaks, And they sigh in the hay; Summer and winter, night and day, Out on the meadow, there dwell they. They never die, Nor snivel, nor cry, Nor ask our pity With a wet eye. A sound estate they never mend, To every asker readily lend; To the ocean wealth, To the meadow health, To Time his length, To the rocks strength, To the stars light, To the weary night, To the busy day, To the idle play; And so their good cheer never ends, For all are their debtors, and all their friends. AH, 'TIS IN VAIN THE PEACEFUL DIN Ah, 'tis in vain the peaceful din That wakes the ignoble town, Not thus did braver spirits win a patriot's renown. There is one field beside this stream, Wherein no foot does fall, But yet it beareth in my dream A richer crop than all. Let me believe a dream so dear, Some heart beat high that day, Above the petty Province here, And Britain far away; Some hero of the ancient mould, Some arm of knightly worth, Of strength unbought, and faith unsold, Honored this spot of earth; Who sought the prize his heart described, And did not ask release, Whose free-born valor was not bribed By prospect of a peace. The men who stood on yonder height That day are long since gone; Not the same hand directs the fight And monumental stone. Ye were the Grecian cities then, The Romes of modern birth, Where the New England husbandmen Have shown a Roman worth. In vain I search a foreign land To find our Bunker Hill, And Lexington and Concord stand By no Laconian rill. BUT SINCE WE SAILED But since we sailed Some things have failed, And many a dream Gone down the stream. Here then an aged shepherd dwelt, Who to his flock his substance dealt, And ruled them with a vigorous crook, By precept of the sacred Book; But he the pierless bridge passed o'er, And solitary left the shore. Anon a youthful pastor came, Whose crook was not unknown to fame, His lambs he viewed with gentle glance, Spread o'er the country's wide expanse, And fed with âMosses from the Manse.â Here was our Hawthorne in the dale, And here the shepherd told his tale. ON PONKAWTASSET, SINCE, WE TOOK OUR WAY On Ponkawtasset, since, we took our way, Down this still stream to far Billericay, A poet wise has settled, whose fine ray Doth often shine on Concord's twilight day. Like those first stars, whose silver beams on high, Shining more brightly as the day goes by, Most travellers cannot at first descry, But eyes that wont to range the evening sky, And know celestial lights, do plainly see, And gladly hail them, numbering two or three; For lore that's deep must deeply studied be, As from deep wells men read star-poetry. These stars are never paled, though out of sight, But like the sun they shine forever bright; Ay, they are suns, though earth must in its flight Put out its eyes that it may see their light. Who would neglect the least celestial sound, Or faintest light that falls on earthly ground, If he could know it one day would be found That star in Cygnus whither we are bound, And pale our sun with heavenly radiance round? AN EARLY UNCONVERTED SAINT An early unconverted Saint, Free from noontide or evening taint, Heathen without reproach, That did upon the civil day encroach, And ever since its birth Had trod the outskirts of the earth. LOW IN THE EASTERN SKY Low in the eastern sky Is set thy glancing eye; And though its gracious light Ne'er riseth to my sight, Yet every star that climbs Above the gnarled limbs Of yonder hill, Conveys thy gentle will. Believe I knew thy thought, And that the zephyrs brought Thy kindest wishes through, As mine they bear to you, That some attentive cloud Did pause amid the crowd Over my head, While gentle things were said. Believe the thrushes sung, And that the flower-bells rung, That herbs exhaled their scent, And beasts knew what was meant, The trees a welcome waved, And lakes their margins laved, When thy free mind To my retreat did wind. It was a summer eve, The air did gently heave While yet a low-hung cloud Thy eastern skies did shroud; The lightning's silent gleam, Startling my drowsy dream, Seemed like the flash Under thy dark eyelash. Still will I strive to be As if thou wert with me; Whatever path I take, It shall be for thy sake, Of gentle slope and wide, As thou wert by my side, Without a root To trip thy gentle foot. I'll walk with gentle pace, And choose the smoothest place, And careful dip the oar, And shun the winding shore, And gently steer my boat Where water-lilies float, And cardinal flowers Stand in their sylvan bowers. DONG, SOUNDS THE BRASS IN THE EAST Dong, sounds the brass in the east, As if to a funeral feast, But I like that sound the best Out of the fluttering west. The steeple ringeth a knell, But the fairies' silvery bell Is the voice of that gentle folk, Or else the horizon that spoke. Its metal is not of brass, But air, and water, and glass, And under a cloud it is swung, And by the wind it is rung. When the steeple tolleth the noon, It soundeth not so soon, Yet it rings a far earlier hour, And the sun has not reached its tower. I MAKE YE AN OFFER I make ye an offer, Ye gods, hear the scoffer, The scheme will not hurt you, If ye will find goodness, I will find virtue. Though I am your creature, And child of your nature, I have pride still unbended, And blood undescended, Some free independence, And my own descendants. I cannot toil blindly, Though ye behave kindly, And I swear by the rood, I'll be slave to no God. If ye will deal plainly, I will strive mainly, If ye will discover, Great plans to your lover, And give him a sphere Somewhat larger than here. CONSCIENCE IS INSTINCT BRED IN THE HOUSE Conscience is instinct bred in the house, Feeling and Thinking propagate the sin By an unnatural breeding in and in. I say, Turn it out doors, Into the moors. I love a life whose plot is simple, And does not thicken with every pimple, A soul so sound no sickly conscience binds it, That makes the universe no worse than 't finds it. I love an earnest soul, Whose mighty joy and sorrow Are not drowned in a bowl, And brought to life to-morrow; That lives one tragedy, And not seventy; A conscience worth keeping, Laughing not weeping; A conscience wise and steady, And forever ready; Not changing with events, Dealing in compliments; A conscience exercised about Large things, where one may doubt. I love a soul not all of wood, Predestinated to be good, But true to the backbone Unto itself alone, And false to none; Born to its own affairs, Its own joys and own cares; By whom the work which God begun Is finished, and not undone; Taken up where he left off, Whether to worship or to scoff; If not good, why then evil, If not good god, good devil. Goodness! you hypocrite, come out of that, Live your life, do your work, then take your hat. I have no patience towards Such conscientious cowards. Give me simple laboring folk, Who love their work, Whose virtue is a song To cheer God along. SUCH WATER DO THE GODS DISTIL Such water do the gods distil, And pour down every hill For their New England men; A draught of this wild nectar bring, And I'll not taste the spring Of Helicon again. THAT PHAETON OF OUR DAY That Phaeton of our day, Who'd make another milky way, And burn the world up with his ray; By us an undisputed seer,â Who'd drive his flaming car so near Unto our shuddering mortal sphere, Disgracing all our slender worth, And scorching up the living earth, To prove his heavenly birth. The silver spokes, the golden tire, Are glowing with unwonted fire, And ever nigher roll and nigher; The pins and axle melted are, The silver radii fly afar, Ah, he will spoil his Father's car! Who let him have the steeds he cannot steer? Henceforth the sun will not shine for a year; And we shall Ethiops all appear. THOUGH ALL THE FATES SHOULD PROVE UNKIND Though all the fates should prove unkind, Leave not your native land behind. The ship, becalmed, at length stands still; The steed must rest beneath the hill; But swiftly still our fortunes pace To find us out in every place. The vessel, though her masts be firm, Beneath her copper bears a worm; Around the cape, across the line, Till fields of ice her course confine; It matters not how smooth the breeze, How shallow or how deep the seas, Whether she bears Manilla twine, Or in her hold Madeira wine, Or China teas, or Spanish hides, In port or quarantine she rides; Far from New England's blustering shore, New England's worm her hulk shall bore, And sink her in the Indian seas, Twine, wine, and hides, and China teas. WITH FRONTIER STRENGTH YE STAND YOUR GROUND With frontier strength ye stand your ground, With grand content ye circle round, Tumultuous silence for all sound, Ye distant nursery of rills, Monadnock and the Peterborough Hills;â Firm argument that never stirs, Outcircling the philosophers,â Like some vast fleet, Sailing through rain and sleet, Through winter's cold and summer's heat; Still holding on upon your high emprise, Until ye find a shore amid the skies; Not skulking close to land, With cargo contraband, For they who sent a venture out by ye Have set the Sun to see Their honesty. Ships of the line, each one, Ye westward run, Convoying clouds, Which cluster in your shrouds, Always before the gale, Under a press of sail, With weight of metal all untold,â I seem to feel ye in my firm seat here, Immeasurable depth of hold, And breadth of beam, and length of running gear. Methinks ye take luxurious pleasure In your novel western leisure; So cool your brows and freshly blue, As Time had naught for ye to do; For ye lie at your length, An unappropriated strength, Unhewn primeval timber, For knees so stiff, for masts so limber; The stock of which new earths are made, One day to be our western trade, Fit for the stanchions of a world Which through the seas of space is hurled. While we enjoy a lingering ray, Ye still o'ertop the western day, Reposing yonder on God's croft Like solid stacks of hay; So bold a line as ne'er was writ On any page by human wit; The forest glows as if An enemy's camp-fires shone Along the horizon, Or the day's funeral pyre Were lighted there; Edged with silver and with gold, The clouds hang o'er in damask fold, And with such depth of amber light The west is dight, Where still a few rays slant, That even Heaven seems extravagant. Watatic Hill Lies on the horizon's sill Like a child's toy left overnight, And other duds to left and right, On the earth's edge, mountains and trees Stand as they were on air graven, Or as the vessels in a haven Await the morning breeze. I fancy even Through your defiles windeth the way to heaven; And yonder still, in spite of history's page, Linger the golden and the silver age; Upon the laboring gale The news of future centuries is brought, And of new dynasties of thought, From your remotest vale. But special I remember thee, Wachusett, who like me Standest alone without society. Thy far blue eye, A remnant of the sky, Seen through the clearing or the gorge, Or from the windows of the forge, Doth leaven all it passes by. Nothing is true But stands 'tween me and you, Thou western pioneer, Who know'st not shame nor fear, By venturous spirit driven Under the eaves of heaven; And canst expand thee there, And breathe enough of air? Even beyond the West Thou migratest, Into unclouded tracts, Without a pilgrim's axe, Cleaving thy road on high With thy well-tempered brow, And mak'st thyself a clearing in the sky. Upholding heaven, holding down earth, Thy pastime from thy birth; Not steadied by the one, nor leaning on the other, May I approve myself thy worthy brother! HERE LIES AN HONEST MAN Here lies an honest man, Rear-Admiral Van. Faith, then ye have Two in one grave, For in his favor, Here too lies the Engraver. THE WESTERN WIND CAME LUMBERING IN The western wind came lumbering in, Bearing a faint Pacific din, Our evening mail, swift at the call Of its Postmaster General; Laden with news from Californ', Whate'er transpired hath since morn, How wags the world by brier and brake From hence to Athabasca Lake;â RUMORS FROM AN AEOLIAN HARP There is a vale which none hath seen, Where foot of man has never been, Such as here lives with toil and strife, An anxious and a sinful life. There every virtue has its birth, Ere it descends upon the earth, And thither every deed returns, Which in the generous bosom burns. There love is warm, and youth is young, And poetry is yet unsung, For Virtue still adventures there, And freely breathes her native air. And ever, if you hearken well, You still may hear its vesper bell, And tread of high-souled men go by, Their thoughts conversing with the sky. AWAY! AWAY! AWAY! AWAY âBefore each van Prick forth the aery knights, and couch their spears Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms From either end of Heaven the welkin burns.â Away! away! away! away! Ye have not kept your secret well, I will abide that other day, Those other lands ye tell. Has time no leisure left for these, The acts that ye rehearse? Is not eternity a lease For better deeds than verse? 'Tis sweet to hear of heroes dead, To know them still alive, But sweeter if we earn their bread, And in us they survive. Our life should feed the springs of fame With a perennial wave, As ocean feeds the babbling founts Which find in it their grave. Ye skies drop gently round my breast, And be my corselet blue, Ye earth receive my lance in rest, My faithful charger you; Ye stars my spear-heads in the sky, My arrow-tips ye are; I see the routed foemen fly, My bright spears fixed are. Give me an angel for a foe, Fix now the place and time, And straight to meet him I will go Above the starry chime. And with our clashing bucklers' clang The heavenly spheres shall ring, While bright the northern lights shall hang Beside our tourneying. And if she lose her champion true, Tell Heaven not despair, For I will be her champion new, Her fame I will repair. LOW-ANCHORED CLOUD Low-anchored cloud, Newfoundland air, Fountain-head and source of rivers, Dew-cloth, dream drapery, And napkin spread by fays; Drifting meadow of the air, Where bloom the daisied banks and violets, And in whose fenny labyrinth The bittern booms and heron wades; Spirit of lakes and seas and rivers, Bear only perfumes and the scent Of healing herbs to just men's fields! MAN'S LITTLE ACTS ARE GRAND Man's little acts are grand, Beheld from land to land, There as they lie in time, Within their native clime. Ships with the noontide weigh, And glide before its ray To some retired bay, Their haunt, Whence, under tropic sun, Again they run, Bearing gum Senegal and Tragicant. For this was ocean meant, For this the sun was sent, And moon was lent, And winds in distant caverns pent. THE WAVES SLOWLY BEAT The waves slowly beat, Just to keep the noon sweet, And no sound is floated o'er, Save the mallet on shore, Which echoing on high Seems a-calking the sky. WOOF OF THE SUN, ETHEREAL GAUZE Woof of the sun, ethereal gauze, Woven of Nature's richest stuffs, Visible heat, air-water, and dry sea, Last conquest of the eye; Toil of the day displayed, sun-dust, Aerial surf upon the shores of earth, Ethereal estuary, frith of light, Breakers of air, billows of heat, Fine summer spray on inland seas; Bird of the sun, transparent-winged Owlet of noon, soft-pinioned, From heath or stubble rising without song; Establish thy serenity o'er the fields. WHERE GLEAMING FIELDS OF HAZE Where gleaming fields of haze Meet the voyageur's gaze, And above, the heated air Seems to make a river there, The pines stand up with pride By the Souhegan's side, And the hemlock and the larch With their triumphal arch Are waving o'er its march To the sea. No wind stirs its waves, But the spirits of the braves Hov'ring o'er, Whose antiquated graves Its still water laves On the shore. With an Indian's stealthy tread, It goes sleeping in its bed, Without joy or grief, Or the rustle of a leaf, Without a ripple or a billow, Or the sigh of a willow, From the Lyndeboro' hills To the Merrimack mills. With a louder din Did its current begin, When melted the snow On the far mountain's brow, And the drops came together In the rainy weather. Experienced river, Hast thou flowed forever? Souhegan soundeth old, But the half is not told, What names hast thou borne, In the ages far gone, When the Xanthus and Meander Commenced to wander, Ere the black bear haunted Thy red forest-floor, Or Nature had planted The pines by thy shore? THIS IS MY CARNAC, WHOSE UNMEASURED DOME This is my Carnac, whose unmeasured dome Shelters the measuring art and measurer's home. Behold these flowers, let us be up with time, Not dreaming of three thousand years ago, Erect ourselves and let those columns lie, Not stoop to raise a foil against the sky. Where is the spirit of that time but in This present day, perchance the present line? Three thousand years ago are not agone, They are still lingering in this summer morn, And Memnon's Mother sprightly greets us now, Wearing her youthful radiance on her brow. If Carnac's columns still stand on the plain, To enjoy our opportunities they remain. TRUE KINDNESS IS A PURE DIVINE AFFINITY True kindness is a pure divine affinity, Not founded upon human consanguinity. It is a spirit, not a blood relation, Superior to family and station. LATELY, ALAS, I KNEW A GENTLE BOY Lately, alas, I knew a gentle boy, Whose features all were cast in Virtue's mould, As one she had designed for Beauty's toy, But after manned him for her own strong-hold. On every side he open was as day, That you might see no lack of strength within, For walls and ports do only serve alway For a pretence to feebleness and sin. Say not that Caesar was victorious, With toil and strife who stormed the House of Fame, In other sense this youth was glorious, Himself a kingdom wheresoe'er he came. No strength went out to get him victory, When all was income of its own accord; For where he went none other was to see, But all were parcel of their noble lord. He forayed like the subtile haze of summer, That stilly shows fresh landscapes to our eyes, And revolutions works without a murmur, Or rustling of a leaf beneath the skies. So was I taken unawares by this, I quite forgot my homage to confess; Yet now am forced to know, though hard it is, I might have loved him had I loved him less. Each moment as we nearer drew to each, A stern respect withheld us farther yet, So that we seemed beyond each other's reach, And less acquainted than when first we met. We two were one while we did sympathize, So could we not the simplest bargain drive; And what avails it now that we are wise, If absence doth this doubleness contrive? Eternity may not the chance repeat, But I must tread my single way alone, In sad remembrance that we once did meet, And know that bliss irrevocably gone. The spheres henceforth my elegy shall sing, For elegy has other subject none; Each strain of music in my ears shall ring Knell of departure from that other one. Make haste and celebrate my tragedy; With fitting strain resound ye woods and fields; Sorrow is dearer in such case to me Than all the joys other occasion yields. Is't then too late the damage to repair? Distance, forsooth, from my weak grasp hath reft The empty husk, and clutched the useless tare, But in my hands the wheat and kernel left. If I but love that virtue which he is, Though it be scented in the morning air, Still shall we be truest acquaintances, Nor mortals know a sympathy more rare. THE ATLANTIDES The smothered streams of love, which flow More bright than Phlegethon, more low, Island us ever, like the sea, In an Atlantic mystery. Our fabled shores none ever reach, No mariner has found our beach, Scarcely our mirage now is seen, And neighboring waves with floating green, Yet still the oldest charts contain Some dotted outline of our main; In ancient times midsummer days Unto the western islands' gaze, To Teneriffe and the Azores, Have shown our faint and cloud-like shores. But sink not yet, ye desolate isles, Anon your coast with commerce smiles, And richer freights ye'll furnish far Than Africa or Malabar. Be fair, be fertile evermore, Ye rumored but untrodden shore, Princes and monarchs will contend Who first unto your land shall send, And pawn the jewels of the crown To call your distant soil their own. MY LOVE MUST BE AS FREE My love must be as free As is the eagle's wing, Hovering o'er land and sea And everything. I must not dim my eye In thy saloon, I must not leave my sky And nightly moon. Be not the fowler's net Which stays my flight, And craftily is set T' allure the sight. But be the favoring gale That bears me on, And still doth fill my sail When thou art gone. I cannot leave my sky For thy caprice, True love would soar as high As heaven is. The eagle would not brook Her mate thus won, Who trained his eye to look Beneath the sun. THE GOOD HOW CAN WE TRUST The Good how can we trust? Only the Wise are just. The Good we use, The Wise we cannot choose. These there are none above; The Good they know and love, But are not known again By those of lesser ken. They do not charm us with their eyes, But they transfix with their advice; No partial sympathy they feel, With private woe or private weal, But with the universe joy and sigh, Whose knowledge is their sympathy. NATURE DOTH HAVE HER DAWN EACH DAY Nature doth have her dawn each day, But mine are far between; Content, I cry, for sooth to say, Mine brightest are I ween. For when my sun doth deign to rise, Though it be her noontide, Her fairest field in shadow lies, Nor can my light abide. Sometimes I bask me in her day, Conversing with my mate, But if we interchange one ray, Forthwith her heats abate. Through his discourse I climb and see, As from some eastern hill, A brighter morrow rise to me Than lieth in her skill. As 'twere two summer days in one, Two Sundays come together, Our rays united make one sun, With fairest summer weather. LET SUCH PURE HATE STILL UNDERPROP âFriends, Romans, Countrymen, and Lovers.â Let such pure hate still underprop Our love, that we may be Each other's conscience, And have our sympathy Mainly from thence. We'll one another treat like gods, And all the faith we have In virtue and in truth, bestow On either, and suspicion leave To gods below. Two solitary stars,â Unmeasured systems far Between us roll, But by our conscious light we are Determined to one pole. What need confound the sphere,â Love can afford to wait, For it no hour's too late That witnesseth one duty's end, Or to another doth beginning lend. It will subserve no use, More than the tints of flowers, Only the independent guest Frequents its bowers, Inherits its bequest. No speech though kind has it, But kinder silence doles Unto its mates, By night consoles, By day congratulates. What saith the tongue to tongue? What heareth ear of ear? By the decrees of fate From year to year, Does it communicate. Pathless the gulf of feeling yawns,â No trivial bridge of words, Or arch of boldest span, Can leap the moat that girds The sincere man. No show of bolts and bars Can keep the foeman out, Or 'scape his secret mine Who entered with the doubt That drew the line. No warder at the gate Can let the friendly in, But, like the sun, o'er all He will the castle win, And shine along the wall. There's nothing in the world I know That can escape from love, For every depth it goes below, And every height above. It waits as waits the sky, Until the clouds go by, Yet shines serenely on With an eternal day, Alike when they are gone, And when they stay. Implacable is Love,â Foes may be bought or teased From their hostile intent, But he goes unappeased Who is on kindness bent. THE INWARD MORNING Packed in my mind lie all the clothes Which outward nature wears, And in its fashion's hourly change It all things else repairs. In vain I look for change abroad, And can no difference find, Till some new ray of peace uncalled Illumes my inmost mind. What is it gilds the trees and clouds, And paints the heavens so gay, But yonder fast-abiding light With its unchanging ray? Lo, when the sun streams through the wood, Upon a winter's morn, Where'er his silent beams intrude The murky night is gone. How could the patient pine have known The morning breeze would come, Or humble flowers anticipate The insect's noonday hum,â Till the new light with morning cheer From far streamed through the aisles, And nimbly told the forest trees For many stretching miles? I've heard within my inmost soul Such cheerful morning news, In the horizon of my mind Have seen such orient hues, As in the twilight of the dawn, When the first birds awake, Are heard within some silent wood, Where they the small twigs break, Or in the eastern skies are seen, Before the sun appears, The harbingers of summer heats Which from afar he bears. MY BOOKS I'D FAIN CAST OFF, I CANNOT READ My books I'd fain cast off, I cannot read, 'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large Down in the meadow, where is richer feed, And will not mind to hit their proper targe. Plutarch was good, and so was Homer too, Our Shakespeare's life were rich to live again, What Plutarch read, that was not good nor true, Nor Shakespeare's books, unless his books were men. Here while I lie beneath this walnut bough, What care I for the Greeks or for Troy town, If juster battles are enacted now Between the ants upon this hummock's crown? Bid Homer wait till I the issue learn, If red or black the gods will favor most, Or yonder Ajax will the phalanx turn, Struggling to heave some rock against the host. Tell Shakespeare to attend some leisure hour, For now I've business with this drop of dew, And see you not, the clouds prepare a shower,â I'll meet him shortly when the sky is blue. This bed of herd's-grass and wild oats was spread Last year with nicer skill than monarchs use, A clover tuft is pillow for my head, And violets quite overtop my shoes. And now the cordial clouds have shut all in, And gently swells the wind to say all's well, The scattered drops are falling fast and thin, Some in the pool, some in the flower-bell. I am well drenched upon my bed of oats; But see that globe come rolling down its stem, Now like a lonely planet there it floats, And now it sinks into my garment's hem. Drip drip the trees for all the country round, And richness rare distils from every bough, The wind alone it is makes every sound, Shaking down crystals on the leaves below. For shame the sun will never show himself, Who could not with his beams e'er melt me so, My dripping locks,âthey would become an elf, Who in a beaded coat does gayly go. THE POET'S DELAY In vain I see the morning rise, In vain observe the western blaze, Who idly look to other skies, Expecting life by other ways. Amidst such boundless wealth without, I only still am poor within, The birds have sung their summer out, But still my spring does not begin. Shall I then wait the autumn wind, Compelled to seek a milder day, And leave no curious nest behind, No woods still echoing to my lay? SALMON BROOK Salmon Brook, Penichook, Ye sweet waters of my brain, When shall I look, Or cast the hook, In your waves again? Silver eels, Wooden creels, These the baits that still allure, And dragon-fly That floated by, May they still endure? I AM THE AUTUMNAL SUN I am the autumnal sun, With autumn gales my race is run; When will the hazel put forth its flowers, Or the grape ripen under my bowers? When will the harvest or the hunter's moon, Turn my midnight into mid-noon? I am all sere and yellow, And to my core mellow. The mast is dropping within my woods, The winter is lurking within my moods, And the rustling of the withered leaf Is the constant music of my grief. I AM A PARCEL OF VAIN STRIVINGS TIED I am a parcel of vain strivings tied By a chance bond together, Dangling this way and that, their links Were made so loose and wide, Methinks, For milder weather. A bunch of violets without their roots, And sorrel intermixed, Encircled by a wisp of straw Once coiled about their shoots, The law By which I'm fixed. A nosegay which Time clutched from out Those fair Elysian fields, With weeds and broken stems, in haste, Doth make the rabble rout That waste The day he yields. And here I bloom for a short hour unseen, Drinking my juices up, With no root in the land To keep my branches green, But stand In a bare cup. Some tender buds were left upon my stem In mimicry of life, But ah! the children will not know, Till time has withered them, The woe With which they're rife. But now I see I was not plucked for naught, And after in life's vase Of glass set while I might survive, But by a kind hand brought Alive To a strange place. That stock thus thinned will soon redeem its hours, And by another year, Such as God knows, with freer air, More fruits and fairer flowers Will bear, While I droop here. ALL THINGS ARE CURRENT FOUND All things are current found On earthly ground, Spirits and elements Have their descents. Night and day, year on year, High and low, far and near, These are our own aspects, These are our own regrets. Ye gods of the shore, Who abide evermore, I see your far headland, Stretching on either hand; I hear the sweet evening sounds From your undecaying grounds; Cheat me no more with time, Take me to your clime. WHO SLEEPS BY DAY AND WALKS BY NIGHT Who sleeps by day and walks by night, Will meet no spirit but some sprite. WE SHOULD NOT MIND IF ON OUR EAR THERE FELL We should not mind if on our ear there fell Some less of cunning, more of oracle. THEN SPEND AN AGE IN WHETTING THY DESIRE Then spend an age in whetting thy desire Thou needs't not hasten if thou dost stand fast. THEREFORE A TORRENT OF SADNESS DEEP Therefore a torrent of sadness deep, Through the strains of thy triumph is heard to sweep. SUCH NEAR ASPECTS HAD WE Such near aspects had we Of our life's scenery. MY LIFE HAS BEEN THE POEM I WOULD HAVE WRIT My life has been the poem I would have writ, But I could not both live and utter it. WE SEE THE PLANET FALL We see the planet fall, And that is all. The other couplets of the Week appear as collations in the poems of which they are a part. For âIt doth expand my privaciesâ and âThe work we choose should be our ownâ see âInspirationâ; for âOur uninquiring corpses lie more lowâ see âTravellingâ; for âMen are by birth equal in this, that givenâ see âPoverty.â VOYAGERS SONG Gentle river, gentle river Swift as glid[e]s thy stream along, Many a bold Canadian voyageur, Bravely swelled the gay chanson Thus of old our valiant fathers, Many a lagging year agone Gliding oer the rippling waters, Taught to banish care in song. Now the sun's behind the willows, Now he gleams along the lake, Hark across the bounding billows Liquid songs the echoes wake. Rise Apollo up before us, E'ne the lark's begun her lay Let us all in deafning chorus Praise the glorious king of day. Thus we lead a life of pleasure, Thus we while the hours away, Thus we revel beyond measure, Gaily live we while we may. I LOVE A CARELESS STREAMLET âLong life and success to you.â Ubique. I love a careless streamlet, That takes a mad-cap leap, And like a sparkling beamlet Goes dashing down the steep. Like torrents of the mountain We've coursed along the lea, From many a crystal fountain Toward the far-distant sea. And now we've gained life's valley, And through the lowlands roam, No longer may'st thou dally, No longer spout and foam. May pleasant meads await thee, Where thou may'st freely roll Towards that bright heavenly sea, Thy resting place and goal. And when thou reach'st life's down-hill, So gentle be thy stream, As would not turn a grist-mill Without the aid of steam. TO THE COMET My sincerity doth surpass The pretence of optic glass. Say what are the highlands yonder Which do keep the spheres asunder The streams of light which centre in our sun And those which from some other system run? Distinguished stranger, system ranger, Plenipotentiary to our sphere, Dost thou know of any danger, War or famine near? Special envoy, foreign minister, From the empire of the sky, Dost thou threaten aught that's sinister By thy course on high? Runner of the firmament On what errand was thou sent, Art thou some great general's scout Come to spy our weakness out? Sculling thy way without a sail, Mid the stars and constellations, The pioneerer of a tail Through the stary nations. Thou celestial privateer We entreat thee come not near. FRIENDSHIP I think awhile of Love, and while I think, Love is to me a world, Sole meat and sweetest drink, And close connecting link Tween heaven and earth. I only know it is, not how or why, My greatest happiness; However hard I try, Not if I were to die, Can I explain. I fain would ask my friend how it can be, But when the time arrives, Then Love is more lovely Than anything to me, And so I'm dumb. For if the truth were known, Love cannot speak, But only thinks and does; Though surely out 'twill leak Without the help of Greek, Or any tongue. A man may love the truth and practise it, Beauty he may admire, And goodness not omit, As much as may befit To reverence. But only when these three together meet, As they always incline, And make one soul the seat, And favorite retreat Of loveliness; When under kindred shape, like loves and hates And a kindred nature, Proclaim us to be mates, Exposed to equal fates Eternally; And each may other help, and service do, Drawing Love's bands more tight, Service he ne'er shall rue While one and one make two, And two are one; In such case only doth man fully prove Fully as man can do, What power there is in Love His inmost soul to move Resistlessly. Two sturdy oaks I mean, which side by side, Withstand the winter's storm, And spite of wind and tide, Grow up the meadow's pride, For both are strong Above they barely touch, but undermined Down to their deepest source, Admiring you shall find Their roots are intertwined Insep'rably. THE CLIFFS &amp; SPRINGS When breathless noon hath paused on hill and vale, And now no more the woodman plies his axe, Now mower whets his scythe, Somewhat it is, sole sojourner on earth, To hear the veery on her oaken perch Ringing her modest trillâ Sole sound of all the din that makes a world, And I sole ear. Fondly to nestle me in that sweet melody, And own a kindred soul, speaking to me From out the depths of universal being. O'er birch and hazle, through the sultry air, Comes that faint sound this way, On Zephyr borne, straight to my ear. No longer time or place, nor faintest trace Of earth, the landscape's shimmer is my only space, Sole remnant of a world. Anon that throat has done, and familiar sounds Swell strangely on the breeze, the low of cattle, And the novel cries of sturdy swains That plod the neighboring valeâ And I walk once more confounded a denizen of earth. THE BLUEBIRDS In the midst of the poplar that stands by our door, We planted a bluebird box, And we hoped before the summer was o'er A transient pair to coax. One warm summer's day the bluebirds came And lighted on our tree, But at first the wand'rers were not so tame But they were afraid of me. They seemed to come from the distant south, Just over the Walden wood, And they skimmed it along with open mouth Close by where the bellows stood. Warbling they swept round the distant cliff, And they warbled it over the lea, And over the blacksmith's shop in a jiff Did they come warbling to me. They came and sat on the box's top Without looking into the hole, And only from this side to that did they hop, As 'twere a common well-pole. Methinks I had never seen them before, Nor indeed had they seen me, Till I chanced to stand by our back door, And they came to the poplar tree. In course of time they built their nest And reared a happy brood, And every morn they piped their best As they flew away to the wood. Thus wore the summer hours away To the bluebirds and to me, And every hour was a summer's day, So pleasantly lived we. They were a world within themselves, And I a world in me, Up in the treeâthe little elvesâ With their callow family. One morn the wind blowed cold and strong, And the leaves when whirling away; The birds prepared for their journey long That raw and gusty day. Boreas came blust'ring down from the north, And ruffled their azure smocks, So they launched them forth, though somewhat loth, By way of the old Cliff rocks. Meanwhile the earth jogged steadily on In her mantle of purest white, And anon another spring was born When winter was vanished quite. And I wandered forth o'er the steamy earth, And gazed at the mellow sky, But never before from the hour of my birth Had I wandered so thoughtfully. For never before was the earth so still, And never so mild was the sky, The river, the fields, the woods, and the hill, Seemed to heave an audible sigh. I felt that the heavens were all around, And the earth was all below, As when in the ears there rushes a sound Which thrills you from top to toe. I dreamed that I was an waking thoughtâ A something I hardly knewâ Not a solid piece, nor an empty nought, But a drop of morning dew. 'Twas the world and I at a game of bo-peep, As a man would dodge his shadow, An idea becalmed in eternity's deepâ 'Tween Lima and Segraddo. Anon a faintly warbled note From out the azure deep, Into my ears did gently float As is the approach of sleep. It thrilled but startled not my soul; Across my mind strange mem'ries gleamed, As often distant scenes u[n]roll When we have lately dreamed The bluebird had come from the distant South To his box in the poplar tree, And he opened wide his slender mouth, On purpose to sing to me. MAY MORNING The school boy loitered on his way to school, Scorning to live so rare a day by rule. So mild the air a pleasure 'twas to breathe, For what seems heaven above was earth beneath. Soured neighbors chatted by the garden pale, Nor quarrelled who should drive the needed nailâ The most unsocial made new friends that day, As when the sun shines husbandmen make hay How long I slept I know not, but at last I felt my consciousness returning fast, For Zephyr rustled past with leafy tread, And heedlessly with one heel grazed my head. My eyelids opened on a field of blue, For close above a nodding violet grew, A part of heaven it seemed, which one could scent, Its blue commingling with the firmament. WALDEN âTrue, our converse a stranger is to speech, Only the practised ear can catch the surging words, That break and die upon thy pebbled lips. Thy flow of thought is noiseless as the lapse of thy own waters, Wafted as is the morning mist up from thy surface, So that the passive Soul doth breathe it in, And is infected with the truth thou wouldst express. E'en the remotest stars have come in troops And stooped low to catch the benediction Of thy countenance. Oft as the day came round, Impartial has the sun exhibited himself Before thy narrow skylightânor has the moon For cycles failed to roll this way As oft as elsewhither, and tell thee of the night. No cloud so rare but hitherward it stalked, And in thy face looked doubly beautiful. O! tell me what the winds have writ within these thousand years, On the blue vault that spans thy floodâ Or sun transferred and delicately reprinted For thy own private reading. Somewhat Within these latter days I've read, But surely there was much that would have thrilled the Soul, Which human eye saw not I would give much to read that first bright page, Wet from a virgin press, when EurusâBoreasâ And the host of airy quill-drivers First dipped their pens in mist. TRUTH-GOODNESS-BEAUTYâTHOSE CELESTIAL THRINS TruthâGoodnessâBeautyâthose celestial thrins, Continually are born; e'en now the Universe, With thousand throatsâand eke with greener smiles, Its joy confesses at their recent birth. IN THE BUSY STREETS, DOMAINS OF TRADE In the busy streets, domains of trade, Man is a surly porter, or a vain and hectoring bully, Who can claim no nearer kindredship with me Than brotherhood by law. I KNEW A MAN BY SIGHT I knew a man by sight, A blameless wight, Who, for a year or more, Had daily passed my door, Yet converse none had had with him. I met him in a lane, Him and his cane, About three miles from home, Where I had chanced to roam, And volumes stared at him, and he at me. In a more distant place I glimpsed his face, And bowed instinctively; Starting he bowed to me, Bowed simultaneously, and passed along. Next, in a foreign land I grasped his hand, And had a social chat, About this thing and that, As I had known him well a thousand years. Late in a wilderness I shared his mess, For he had hardships seen, And I a wanderer been; He was my bosom friend, and I was his. And as, methinks, shall all, Both great and small, That ever lived on earth, Early or late their birth, Stranger and foe, one day each other know. CLIFFS The loudest sound that burdens here the breeze Is the wood's whisper; 'tis when we choose to list Audible sound, and when we list not, It is calm profound. Tongues were provided But to vex the ear with superficial thoughts. When deeper thoughts upswell, the jarring discord Of harsh speech is hushed, and senses seem As little as may be to share the extacy. MY BOOTS Anon with gaping fearlessness they quaff The dewy nectar with a natural thirst, Or wet their leathern lungs where cranberries lurk, With sweeter wine than Chian, Lesbian, or Falernian far. Theirs was the inward lustre that bespeaks An open soleâunknowing to exclude The cheerful dayâa worthier glory far Than that which gilds the outmost rind with darkness visibleâ Virtues that fast abide through lapse of years, Rather rubbed in than off. NOON What time the bittern, solitary bird, Hides now her head amid the whispering fern, And not a paddock vexes all the shoreâ Nor feather ruffles the incumbent air, Save where the wagtail interrupts the noon. THE THAW I saw the civil sun drying earth's tearsâ Her tears of joy that only faster flowed, Fain would I stretch me by the hig[h]way side, To thaw and trickle with the melting snow, That mingled soul and body with the tide, I too may through the pores of nature flow. But I alas nor trickle can nor fume, One jot to forward the great work of Time, 'Tis mine to hearken while these ply the loom, So shall my silence with their music chime. LAST NIGHT AS I LAY GAZING WITH SHUT EYES Last night as I lay gazing with shut eyes Into the golden land of dreams, I thought I gazed adown a quiet reach Of land and water prospect, Whose low beach Was peopled with the now subsiding hum Of happy industryâwhose work is done. And as I turned me on my pillow o'er, I heard the lapse of waves upon the shore, Distinct as it had been at broad noonday, And I were wandering at Rockaway. LOVE We two that planets erst had been Are now a double star, And in the heavens may be seen, Where that we fixed are. Yet whirled with subtle power along, Into new space we enter, And evermore with spheral song Revolve about one centre. 'TWILL SOON APPEAR IF WE BUT LOOK 'Twill soon appear if we but look At evening into earth's day book, Which way the great account doth stand Between the heavens and the land. THE PEAL OF THE BELLS When the world grows old by the chimney side, Then forth to the youngling rocks I glideâ Where over the water, and over the land, The bells are booming on either hand. Now up they go ding, then down again dong, And awhile they swing to the same old song, And the metal goes round 't a single bound, A-lulling the fields with i[t]s measured soundâ Till the tired tongue falls with a lengthened boom, As solemn and loud as the crack of doom. Then changed is their measure to tone upon tone, And seldom it is that one sound comes alone, For they ring out their peals in a mingled throng, And the breezes waft the loud ding-dong along. When the echo has reached me in this lone vale, I am straightway a hero in coat of mail, I tug at my belt and I march on my post, And feel myself more than a match for a host. I am on the alert for some wonderful Thing, W[h]ich somewhere's a taking place, 'Tis perchance the salute which our planet doth ring When it meeteth another in space. THE âBOOK OF GEMSâ âWith cunning plates the polished leaves were decked, Each one a window to the poet's world, So rich a prospect that you might suspect In that small space all paradise unfurled. It was a right delightful road to go, marching through pastures of such fair herbage, O'er hill and dale it lead, and to and fro, From bard to bard, making an easy stage. Where ever and anon I slaked my thirst Like a tired traveller at some poet's well, Which from the teeming ground did bubbling burst, And tinkling thence adown the page it fell. Still through the leaves its music you might hear, Till other springs fell faintly on the ear. THE ASSABET Up this pleasant stream let's row For the livelong summer's day, Sprinkling foam where'er we go In wreaths as white as driven snowâ Ply the oars, away! away! Now we glide along the shore, Chucking lillies as we go, While the yellow-sanded floor Doggedly resists the oar, Like some turtle dull and slow. Now we stem the middle tide Ploughing through the deepest soil, Ridges pile on either side, While we through the furrow glide, Reaping bubbles for our toil. Dew before and drought behind, Onward all doth seem to fly; Nought contents the eager mind, Only rapids now are kind, Forward are the earth and sky. Sudden music strikes the ear, Leaking out from yonder bank, Fit such voyagers to cheerâ Sure there must be naiads here, Who have kindly played this prank. There I know the cunning pack Where yon self-sufficient rill All its telltale hath kept back, Through the meadows held its clack, And now bubbleth its fill. Silent flows the parent stream, And if rocks do lie below Smothers with her waves the din, As it were a youthful sin, Just as still and just as slow. But this gleeful little rill, Purling round its storied pebble, Tinkles to the selfsame tune From December until June, Nor doth any drought enfeeble. See the sun behind the willows, Rising through the golden haze, How he gleams along the billowsâ Their white crests the easy pillows Of his dew besprinkled rays. Forward press we to the dawning, For Aurora leads the way, Sultry noon and twilight scorning, In each dew drop of the morning Lies the promise of a day. Rivers from the sun do flow, Springing with the dewy morn, Voyageurs 'gainst time do row, Idle noon nor sunset know, Ever even with the dawn. Since that first away! away! Many a lengthy league we've rowed, Still the sparrow on the spray, Hastes to usher in the day With her simple stanza'd ode. THE BREEZE'S INVITATION Come let's roam the breezy pastures, Where the freest zephyrs blow, Batten on the oak tree's rustle, And the pleasant insect bustle, Dripping with the streamlet's flow. What if I no wings do wear, Thro' this solid seeming air I can skim like any swallow Who so dareth let her follow, And we'll be a jovial pair. Like two careless swifts let's sail, Zephyrus shall think for meâ Over hill and over dale, Riding on the easy gale, We will scan the earth and sea. Yonder see that willow tree Winnowing the buxom air, You a gnat and I a bee, With our merry minstrelsy We will make a concert there. One green leaf shall be our screen, Till the sun doth go to bed, I the king and you the queen Of that peaceful little green, Without any subject's aid. To our music Time will linger, And earth open wide her ear, Nor shall any need to tarry To immortal verse to marry Such sweet music as he'll hear. LOVES FAREWELL Light hearted, careless, shall I take my way, When I to thee this being have resigned, Well knowing where upon a future day, With usurer's craft, more than myself to find. EACH MORE MELODIOUS NOTE I HEAR Each more melodious note I hear Brings this reproach to me, That I alone afford the ear, Who would the music be. I WAS BORN UPON THY BANK RIVER I was born upon thy bank river My blood flows in thy stream And thou meanderest forever At the bottom of my dream THE FISHER'S SON I know the world where land and water meet, By yonder hill abutting on the main, One while I hear the waves incessant beat, Then turning round survey the land again. Within a humble cot that looks to sea Daily I breathe this curious warm life, Beneath a friendly haven's sheltering lea My noiseless day with myst'ry still is rife. 'Tis here, they say, my simple life began, And easy credit to the tale I lend, For well I know 'tis here I am a man, But who will simply tell me of the end? These eyes fresh opened spied the far off Sea, Which like a silent godfather did stand, Nor uttered one explaining word to me, But introduced straight godmother Sand. And yonder still stretches that silent main, With many glancing ships besprinkled o'er, And earnest still I gaze and gaze again Upon the self same waves and friendly shore Till like a watery humor on the eye It still appears whichever way I turn, Its silent waste and mute oerarching sky With close shut eyes I clearly still discern. And yet with lingering doubt I haste each morn To see if Ocean still my gaze will greet, And with each day once more to life am born, And tread the earth once more with tott'ring feet. My years are like a stroll upon the beach, As near the ocean's edge as I can go; My tardy steps its waves sometimes o'erreach, Sometimes I stay to let them overflow. Infinite work my hands find there to do, Gathering the relics which the waves up cast; Each tempest scours the deep for something new, And every time the strangest is the last. My sole employment 'tis and scrupulous care, To place my gains beyond the reach of tides, Each smoother pebble and each shell more rare Which ocean kindly to my hand confides. I have but few companions on the shore, They scorn the strand who sail upon the sea, Yet oft I think the ocean they've sailed oer Is deeper known upon the strand to me. My neighbors sometimes come with lumb'ring carts, As if they wished my pleasant toil to share, But straightway go again to distant marts For only weeds and ballast are their care. 'Tis by some strange coincidence if I Make common cause with ocean when he storms Who can so well support a separate sky, And people it with multitude of forms. Oft in the stillness of the night I hear Some restless bird presage the coming din, And distant murmurs faintly strike my ear From some bold bluff projecting far within. My stillest depths straightway do inly heave More genially than rests the summer's calm, The howling winds through my soul's cordage grieve, Till every shelf and ledge gives the alarm. Oft at some ruling star my tide has swelled, The sea can scarcely brag more wrecks than I, Ere other influence my waves has quelled The staunchest bark that floats is high and dry. I'M GUIDED IN THE DARKEST NIGHT I'm guided in the darkest night By flashes of auroral light, Which over dart thy eastern home And teach me not in vain to roam. Thy steady light on t'other side Pales the sunset, makes day abide, And after sunrise stays the dawn, Forerunner of a brighter morn. There is no being here to me But staying here to be When others laugh I am not glad, When others cry I am not sad, But be they grieved or be they merry I'm supernumerary. I am a miser without blame Am conscience stricken without shame. An idler am I without leisure, A busy body without pleasure. I did not think so bright a day Would issue in so dark a night. I did not think such sober play Would leave me in so sad a plight, And I should be most sorely spent Where first I was most innocent. I thought by loving all beside To prove to you my love was wide, And by the rites I soared above To show you my peculiar love. FRIENDSHIP Now we are partners in such legal trade, We'll look to the beginnings, not the ends, Nor to pay dayâknowing true wealth is made For current stock and not for dividends. ON THE SUN COMING OUT IN THE AFTERNOON Methinks all things have travelled since you shined, But only Time, and clouds, Time's team, have moved; Again foul weather shall not change my mind, But In the shade I will believe what in the sun I loved. THEY WHO PREPARE MY EVENING MEAL BELOW They who prepare my evening meal below Carelessly hit the kettle as they go With tongs or shovel, And ringing round and round, Out of this hovel It makes an eastern temple by the sound. At first I thought a cow-bell right at hand Mid birches sounded o'er the open land, Where I plucked flowers Many years ago, Spending midsummer hours With such secure delight they hardly seemed to flow. MY GROUND IS HIGH My ground is high, But 'tis not dry, What you call dew Comes filtering through; Though in the sky, It still is nigh; Its soil is blue And virgin too. IF FROM YOUR PRICE YE WILL NOT SWERVE If from your price ye will not swerve, Why then Ill think the gods reserve A greater bargain there above, Out of their sup'rabundant love, Have meantime better for me cared, And so will get my stock prepared, Plows of new pattern, hoes the same, Designed a different soil to tame, And sow my seed broadcast in air, Certain to reap my harvest there. FRIENDSHIP'S STEADFASTNESS True friendship is so firm a league That's maintenance falls into the even tenor Of our lives, and is no tie, But the continuance of our lifes thread. If I would safely keep this new got pelf, I have no care henceforth but watch myself, For lo! it goes untended from my sight, Waxes and wanes secure with the safe star of night. See with what liberal step it makes its way, As we could well afford to let it stray Throughout the universe, with the sun &amp; moon, Which would dissolve allegiance as soon. Shall I concern myself for fickleness, And undertake to make my friends more sure, When the great gods out of sheer kindliness, Gave me this office for a sinecure? DEATH CANNOT COME TOO SOON Death cannot come too soon Where it can come at all, But always is too late Unless the fates it call. INDEPENDENCE My life more civil is and free Than any civil polity. Ye princes keep your realms And circumscribed power, Not wide as are my dreams, Nor rich as is this hour. What can ye give which I have not? What can ye take which I have got? Can ye defend the dangerless? Can ye inherit nakedness? To all true wants time's ear is deaf, Penurious states lend no relief Out of their pelfâ But a free soulâthank Godâ Can help itself. Be sure your fate Doth keep apart its stateâ Not linked with any bandâ Even the nobles of the land In tented fields with cloth of goldâ No place doth hold But is more chivalrous than they are. And sigheth for a nobler war. A finer strain its trumpet ringsâ A brighter gleam its armor flings. The life that I aspire to live No man proposeth meâ No trade upon the street Wears its emblazonry. OUR COUNTRY It is a noble country where we dwell, Fit for a stalwart race to summer in; From Madawaska to Red River raft, From Florid keys to the Missouri forks, See what unwearied (and) copious streams Come tumbling to the east and southern shore, To find a man stand on their lowland banks: Behold the innumerous rivers and the licks Where he may drink to quench his summer's thirst, And the broad corn and rice fields yonder, where His hands may gather for his winter's store. See the fair reaches of the northern lakes To cool his summer with their inland breeze, And the long slumbering Appalachian range Offering its slopes to his unwearied knees! See what a long-lipped sea doth clip the shores, And noble strands where navies may find port; See Boston, Baltimore, and New York stand Fair in the sunshine on the eastern sea, And yonder too the fair green prairie. See the red race with sullen step retreat, Emptying its graves, striking the wigwam tent, And where the rude camps of its brethern stand, Dotting the distant green, their herds around; In serried ranks, and with a distant clang, Their fowl fly o'er, bound to the northern lakes, Whose plashing waves invite their webbÃ©d feet. Such the fair reach and prospect of the land, The journeying summer creeps from south to north With wearied feet, resting in many a vale; Its length doth tire the seasons to o'ercome, Its widening breadth doth make the sea-breeze pause And spend its breath against the mountain's side: Still serene Summer paints the southern fields, While the stern Winter reigns on northern hills. Look nearer,âknow the lineaments of each face,â Learn the far-travelled race, and find here met The so long gathering congress of the world! The Afric race brought here to curse its fate, Erin to bless,âthe patient German too, Th' industrious Swiss, the fickle, sanguine Gaul, And manly Saxon, leading all the rest. All things invite this earth's inhabitants To rear their lives to an unheard-of height, And meet the expectation of the land; To give at length the restless race of man A pause in the long westering caravan. THE MOON NOW RISES TO HER ABSOLUTE RULE The moon now rises to her absolute rule, And the husbandman and hunter Acknowledge her for their mistress. Asters and golden reign in the fields And the life everlasting withers not. The fields are reaped and shorn of their pride But [?] an inward verdure still crowns them The thistle scatters its down on the pool And yellow leaves clothe the riverâ And nought disturbs the serious life of men. But behind the sheaves and under the sod There lurks a ripe fruit which the reapers have not gathered The true harvest of the yearâthe boreal[?] fruit Which it bears forever. With fondness annually watering and maturing it. But man never severs the stalk Which bears this palatable fruit. MY FRIENDS, WHY SHOULD WE LIVE My friends, why should we live? Life is an idle war a toilsome peace; To-day I would not give One small consent for its securest ease. Shall we out-wear the year In our pavilions on its dusty plain And yet no signal hear To strike our tents and take the road again? Or else drag up the slope The heavy ordnance of nature's train? Useless but in the hope, Some far remote and heavenward hill to gain. I MARK THE SUMMER'S SWIFT DECLINE I mark the summer's swift decline The springing sward its grave clothes weaves Whose rustling woods the gales confine The aged year turns on its couch of leaves. Oh could I catch the sounds remote Could I but tell to human earâ The strains which on the breezes float And sing the requiem of the dying year. METHINKS THAT BY A STRICT BEHAVIOR Methinks that by a strict behavior I could elicit back the brightest star That lurks behind a cloud. I HAVE ROLLED NEAR SOME OTHER SPIRITS PATH I have rolled near some other spirits path And with a pleased anxiety have felt Its purer influence on my opaque mass But always was I doomed to learn, alas! I had scarce changed its sidireal time. TRAVELLING How little curious is man He has not searched his mystery a span But dreams of mines of treasure Which he neglects to measure. For three score years and ten Walks to and fro amid his fellow men O'er this small tract of continental land And never uses a divining wand. Our uninquiring corpses lie more low Than our life's curiosity doth go Our ambitious steps ne'er climb so high As in their daily sport the sparrows fly And yonder cloud's borne farther in a day Than our most vagrant steps may ever stray. Surely, O Lord, he has not greatly erred, Who has so little from his threshhold stirred. He wanders through this low and shallow world Scarcely his loftier thoughts and hopes unfurled, Through this low walled world, where his huge sin Has hardly room to rest and harbor in. He wanders round until his end draws nigh And then lays down his aged head to dye And this is life, this is that famous strife. ON FIELDS OER WHICH THE REAPER'S HAND HAS PASS[E]D On fields oer which the reaper's hand has pass[e]d, Lit by the harvest moon and autumn sun, My thoughts like stubble floating in the wind And of such fineness as October airs, There after harvest could I glean my life A richer harvest reaping without toil, And weaving gorgeous fancies at my will In subtler webs than finest summer haze. TO A MARSH HAWK IN SPRING There is health in thy gray wing Health of nature's furnishing. Say thou modern-winged antique, Was thy mistress ever sick? In each heaving of thy wing Thou dost health and leisure bring, Thou dost waive disease &amp; pain And resume new life again. GREAT FRIEND I walk in nature still alone And know no one Discern no lineament nor feature Of any creature. Though all the firmament Is oer me bent, Yet still I miss the grace Of an intelligent and kindred face. I still must seek the friend Who does with nature blend, Who is the person in her mask, He is the man I ask. Who is the expression of her meaning, Who is the uprightness of her leaning, Who is the grown child of her weaning The center of this world, The face of nature, The site of human life, Some sure foundation And nucleus of a nationâ At least a private station. We twain would walk together Through every weather, And see this aged nature, Go with a bending stature. YET LET US THANK THE PURBLIND RACE Yet les Thank the purblind race, Who still have thought it good With lasting stone to mark the place Where braver men have stood. In concord, town of quiet name And quiet fame as well, IVE SEEN YE, SISTERS, ON THE MOUNTAIN-SIDE Ive seen ye, sisters, on the mountain-side When your green mantles fluttered in the wind Ive seen your foot-prints on the lakes smooth shore Lesser than man's, a more ethereal trace, I have heard of ye as some far-famed raceâ Daughters of gods whom I should one day meetâ Or mothers I might say of all our race. I reverence your natures so like mine Yet strangely different, like but still unlike Thou only stranger that hast crossed my path Accept my hospitalityâlet me hear The message which thou bring'st Made different from me Perchance thou't made to be The creature of a different destiny. I know not who ye are that meekly stand Thus side by side with man in every land. When did ye form alliance with our race Ye children of the moon who in placid nights Vaulted upon the hills and sought this earth. Reveal that which I fear ye can not tell Wherein ye are not I, wherein ye dwell Where I can never come. What boots it that I do regard ye so Does it make suns to shine or crops to grow? What boots that I never should forget Thee[?], I have sisters sitting for me yet And what are sisters The robust man who can so stoutly strive In this bleak world is hardly kept alive. And who is it protects ye smooths your way YE DO COMMAND ME TO ALL VIRTUE EVER Ye do command me to all virtue ever And simple truth the law by which we live Methinks that I can trust your clearer sense And your immediate knowledge of the truth. I would obey your influenceâone with fate ON SHOULDERS WHIRLED IN SOME ECCENTRIC ORBIT On shoulders whirled in some eccentric orbit Just by old Paestum's temples and the perch Where Time doth plume his wings. FOG Dull water spiritâand Protean god Descended cloud fast anchored to the earth That drawest too much air for shallow coasts Thou ocean branch that flowest to the sun Incense of earth, perfumed with flowersâ Spirit of lakes and rivers, seas and rills Come to revisit now thy native scenes Night thoughts of earthâdream drapery Dew cloth and fairy napkin Thou wind-blown meadow of the air. BROTHER WHERE DOST THOU DWELL Brother where dost thou dwell? What sun shines for thee now? Dost thou indeed farewell? As we wished here below. What season didst thou find? 'Twas winter here. Are not the fates more kind Than they appear? Is thy brow clear again As in thy youthful years? And was that ugly pain The summit of thy fears? Yet thou wast cheery still, They could not quench thy fire, Thou dids't abide their will, And then retire. Where chiefly shall I look To feel thy presence near? Along the neighboring brook May I thy voice still hear? Dost thou still haunt the brink Of yonder river's tide? And may I ever think That thou art at my side? What bird wilt thou employ To bring me word of thee? For it would give them joy, 'Twould give them liberty, To serve their former lord With wing and minstrelsy. A sadder strain has mixed with their song, They've slowlier built their nests, Since thou art gone Their lively labor rests. Where is the finchâthe thrush, I used to hear? Ah! they could well abide The dying year. Now they no more return, I hear them not; They have remained to mourn, Or else forgot. EPITAPH ON PURSY Traveller, this is no prison, He is not dead, but risen. Then is there need, To fill his grave, And truth to save, That we should read,â In Pursy's favor Here lies the engraver. EP[ITAPH] ON THE WORLD Here lies the body of this world, Whose soul alas to hell is hurled. This golden youth long since was past, Its silver manhood went as fast, And iron age drew on at last; 'Tis vain its character to tell, The several fates which it befell, What year it died, when 'twill arise, We only know that here it lies. EPITAPH ON AN ENGRAVER By death's favor Here lies the engraver And now I think o't Where lies he not? If the archangel look but where he lies He ne'er will get translated to the skies. THE JUST MADE PERFECT A stately music rises on my ear, Borne on the breeze from some adjacent vale; A host of knights, my own true ancestors, Tread to the lofty strains and pass away In long procession; to this music's sound The Just move onward in deep serried ranks, With looks serene of hope, and gleaming brows, As if they were the temples of the Day. Gilt by an unseen sun's resplendent ray They firmly move, sure as the lapse of Time; Departed worth, leaving these trivial fields Where sedate valor finds no worthy aim, And still is Fame the noblest cause of all. Forward they press and with exalted eye, As if their road, which seems a level plain, Did still ascend, and were again subdued 'Neath their proud feet. Forward they move, and leave The sun and moon and stars alone behind: And now, by the still fainter strains, I know They surely pass; and soon their quivering harp, And faintly clashing cymbal, will have ceased To feed my ear. It is the steadiest motion eye hath seen, A Godlike progress; e'en the hills and rocks Do forward come, so to congratulate Their feet; the rivers eddy backward, and The waves recurl to accompany their march. Onward they move, like to the life of man, Which cannot rest, but goes without delay Right to the gates of Death, not losing time In its majestic tread to Eternity, As if Man's blood, a river, flowed right on Far as the eye could reach, to the Heart of hearts, Nor eddied round about these complex limbs. 'Tis the slow march of life,âI feel the feet Of tiny drops go pattering through my veins; Their arteries flow with an Assyrian pace, And empires rise and fall beneath their stride. Still, as they move, flees the horizon wall; The low-roofed sky o'erarches their true path; For they have caught at last the pace of Heaven, Their great Commander's true and timely tread. Lo! how the sky before them is cast up Into an archÃ¨d road, like to the gallery Of the small mouse that bores the meadow's turf: Chapels of ease swift open o'er the path, And domes continuous span the lengthening way. TELL ME YE WISE ONES IF YE CAN Tell me ye wise ones if ye can Whither and whence the race of man. For I have seen his slender clan Clinging to hoar hills with their feet Threading the forest for their meat Moss and lichens bark &amp; grain They rake together with might &amp; main And they digest them with anxiety &amp; pain. I meet them in their rags and unwashed hair Instructed to eke out their scanty fare Brave raceâwith a yet humbler prayer Beggars they are aye on the largest scale They beg their daily bread at heavens door And if their this years crop alone shou[l]d fail They neither bread nor begging would know more. They are the titmans [?] of their race And hug the vales with mincing pace Like Troglodites. and fight with cranes. We walk mid great relations feet What they let fall alone we eat We are only able to catch the fragments from their table These elder brothers of our race By us unseen with larger pace Walk oer our heads, and live our lives embody our desires and dreams Anticipate our hoped for gleams We grub the earth for our food We know not what is good Where does the fragrance of our orchards go Our vineyards while we toil belowâ A finer race and finer fed Feast and revel above our head. The tints and fragrance of the flowers &amp; fruits Are but the crumbs from off their table While we consume the pulp and roots Some times we do assert our kin And stand a moment where once they have been We hear their sounds and see their sights And we experience their delightsâ But for the moment that we stand Astonished on the Olympian land We do discern no traveller's face No elder brother of our race. To lead us to the monarch's court And represent our case. But straightway we must journey back retracing slow the arduous track, Without the privilege to tell Even, the sight we know so well. THE EARTH The Earth Which seems so barren once gave birth To heroesâwho oerran her plains, Who plowed her seas and reaped her grains THE HERO What doth he ask? Some worthy task. Never to run Till that be done, that never done Under the sun. Here to begin All things to win By his endeavor Forever and everâ Happy and well On this ground to dwell This soil subdue Plant and renew. By might &amp; main Hea[l]th &amp; strength gain So to give nerve To his slenderness Yet Some mighty pain He would sustain. So to preserve His tenderness. Not be deceived Of suffring bereaved Not lose his life By living too well Nor escape strife In his lonely cell And so find out Heaven By not knowing Hell. Strength like the rock To withstand any shockâ Yet some Aaron's rod Some smiting by god Occasion to gain To shed human tears And to entertain Still divine fears. Not once for all, forever, blest, Still to be cheered out of the west Not from his heart to banish all sighs Still be encouraged by the sun rise Forever to love and to love and to love Within him, around himâbeneath him above To love is to know, is to feel, is to be At once 'tis his birth &amp; his destiny For earthly pleasures Celestial pains Heavenly losses For earthly gains. Must we still eat The bread we have spurned Must we rekindle The faggots we've burnedâ Must we go out By the poor man's gate Die by degrees Not by new fate. Is then[?] no road This way my friend Is there no road Without any endâ When I have slumbered I have heard sounds As travellers passing Over my groundsâ 'Twas a sweet music Wafted them by I could not tell If far off or nigh. Unless I dreamed it This was of yoreâ But I never told it To mortal beforeâ Never remembered But in my dreams What to me waking A miracle seems If you will give of your pulse or your grain We will rekindle those flames again Here will we tarry it is without doubt Till a miracle putteth that fire out. AT MIDNIGHT'S HOUR I RAISED MY HEAD At midnight's hour I raised my head The owls were seeking for their bread The foxes barked impatient still At their wan[?] fate they bear so illâ I thought me of eternities delayed And of commands but half obeyedâ The night wind rustled through the glade As if a force of men there staid The word was whispered through the ranks And every hero seized his lance The word was whispered through the ranks Advance. I SEEK THE PRESENT TIME I seek the Present Time, No other clime, Life in to-day, Not to sail another way, To Paris or to Rome, Or farther still from home. That man, whoe'er he is, Lives but a moral death, Whose life is not coeval With his breath. What are deeds done Away from home? What the best essay On the Ruins of Rome? The dusty highways, What Scripture says, This pleasant weather And all signs togetherâ The river's meander, All things, in short, Forbid me to wander In deed or in thought. In cold or in drouth, seek Not the sunny South, But make the whole tour Of the sunny Present Hour. For here if thou fail, Where canst thou prevail? If you love not Your own land most, You'll find nothing lovely Upon a distant coast. If you love not The latest sunset, What is there in pictures Or old gems set? If no man should travel Till he had the means, There'd be little travelling For kings or for Queens. The means, what are they! They are the wherewithal Great expenses to pay;â Life got, and some to spare, Great works on hand, And freedom from care. Plenty of time well spent, To use,â Clothes paid for, and no rent In your shoes;â Something to eat, And something to burn, And, above all, no need to return;â For they who come back, have they not failed, Wherever they've ridden Or steamed it, or sailed? All your grass hayed,â All your debts paid,â All your wills made? Then you might as well have stayed, For are you not dead. Only not buried? The way unto âTodayâ, The rail road to âHere,â They never'll grade that way, Nor shorten it, I fear. There are plenty of depots All the world o'er, But not a single station At a man's door; If we would get near To the secret of things, We shall not have to hear When the engine bell rings. LOVES INVALIDES ARE NOT THOSE OF COMMON WARS Loves invalides are not those of common wars More than its scarsâ They are not disabled for a higher love But taught to look above. With erring men I have small affair Though they can do some harm &amp; do not care. It is a part of them which I can not commend A part of them that never was my friend. AND ONCE AGAIN And once again When I went a-mayingâ &amp; once or twice more I had seen thee before. For there grow the May flowe[r] (Epigaea repens) &amp; the mt cranberry &amp; the screech owl strepens OLD MEETING-HOUSE BELL Old meeting-house bell I love thy music well It peals through the air Sweetly full &amp; fair As in the early times When I listened to its chimes. IS CONSIGNED TO THE NINE Is consigned to the nine. I to nature consign. I am but the [word] of myself. Without inlet it lies without outlet it flows From &amp; to the skies It comes &amp; it goes I am its source, &amp; my life is its course I am its stoney shore &amp; the gale that passes oer AMONG THE WORST OF MEN THAT EVER LIVED Among the worst of men that ever lived However we did seriously attend A little space we let our thoughts ascend Experienced our religion &amp; confessed 'Twas good for us to be thereâbe anywhere Then to a heap of apples we addressed &amp; cleared the topmost rider sine care But our Icarian thoughts returned to ground And we went on to heaven the long way round. TALL AMBROSIA Among the signs of autumn I perceive The Roman wormwood (called by learned men Ambrosia elatior, food for gods,â For to impartial science the humblest weed Is as immortal once[?] as the proudest flowerâ) Sprinkles its yellow dust over my shoes As I cross the now neglected garden âWe trample under foot the food of gods &amp; spill their nectar in each drop of dewâ My honest shoes Fast friends that never stray far from my couch thus powdered countryfied Bearing many a mile the marks of their adventure At the post-house disgrace the Gallic gloss Of those well dressed ones who no morning dew Nor Roman wormwood ever have been through Who never walk but are transported ratherâ For what old crime of theirs I do not gather TH' AMBROSIA OF THE GODS 'S A WEED ON EARTH Th' ambrosia of the Gods 's a weed on earth Their nectar is the morning dew which on 'ly our shoes tasteâFor they are simple folks 'Tis very fit the ambrosia of the gods Should be a weed on earth. As nectar is The morning dew with which we wet our shoes For the gods are simple folks and we should pine upon their humble fare I SAW A DELICATE FLOWER HAD GROWN UP 2 FEET HIGH I saw a delicate flower had grown up 2 feet high Between the horse's paths &amp; the wheel track Which Dakin's &amp; Maynards wagons had Passed over many a time An inch more to right or left had sealed its fate Or an inch higher. And yet it lived &amp; flourish[e]d As much as if it had a thousand acres Of untrodden space around itâand never Knew the danger it incurred. It did not borrow trouble nor invite an Evil fate by apprehending it. For though the distant market-wagon Every other dayâinevitably rolled This wayâit just as inevitably rolled In those rutsâAnd the same Charioteer who steered the flower Upwardâguided the horse &amp; cart aside from it. There were other flowers which you would say Incurred less danger grew more out of the way Which no cart rattled near, no walker daily passed. But at length one rambling deviously For no rut restrained plucked them And then it appeared that they stood Directly in his way though he had come From farther than the market wagonâ TO DAY I CLIMBED A HANDSOME ROUNDED HILL To day I climbed a handsome rounded hill Covered with hickory trees wishing to see The country from its topâfor low hills show unexpected prospectsâI looked many miles over a woody low-land Toward Marlborough Framingham &amp; Sudbury And as I sat amid the hickory trees I AM THE LITTLE IRISH BOY I am the little Irish boy That lives in the shanty I am four years old today And shall soon be one and twenty I shall grow up And be a great man And shovel all day As hard as I can. Down in the deep cut Where the men lived Who made the Rail road. for supper I have some potatoe And sometimes some bread And then if it's cold I go right to bed. I lie on some straw Under my fathers coat My mother does not cry And my father does not scold For I am a little Irish Boy And I'm four years old. Every day I go to school Along the Railroad It was so cold it made me cry The day that it snowed. And if my feet ache I do not mind the cold For I am a little Irish boy &amp; I'm four years old. I DO NOT FEAR MY THOUGHTS WILL DIE I do not fear my thoughts will die For never yet it was so dry as to scorch the azure of the sky. It knows no withering &amp; no drought Though all eyes crop it ne'er gives out My eyes my flocks are Mountains my crops are I do not fear my flocks will stray For they were made to roam the day For they can wander with the latest light Yet be at home at night. CANS'T THOU LOVE WITH THY MIND Cans't thou love with thy mind, And reason with thy heart? Cans't thou be kind, And from thy darling part? Cans't thou range earth sea, &amp; air, And so meet me everywhere? Through all events I will pursue thee, Through all persons I will woo thee. INDEED INDEED, I CANNOT TELL Indeed indeed, I cannot tell, Though I ponder on it well, Which were easier to state, All my love or all my hate. Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me When I say thou dost disgust me. O, I hate thee with a hate That would fain annihilate; Yet sometimes against my will, My dear friend, I love thee still. It were treason to our love, And a sin to God above, One iota to abate Of a pure impartial hate. THE VESSEL OF LOVE, THE VESSEL OF STATE The vessel of love, the vessel of state, Each is ballasted with hate. Every Congress that we hold Means the union is dissolved. But though the south is still enslaved, By that oath the Union's saved, For 'tis our love and not our hate Interests us in their fate. WHEN THE TOADS BEGIN TO RING When the toads begin to ring, Then thinner clothing bring or Off your greatcoat fling FOREVER IN MY DREAM &amp; IN MY MORNING THOUGHT Forever in my dream &amp; in my morning thought Eastward a mount ascendsâ But when in the sunbeam its hard outline is soughtâ It all dissolves &amp; ends. The woods that way are gatesâthe pastures too slop[e] up To an unearthly groundâ But when I ask my mates, to take the staff &amp; cup, It can no more be foundâ Perchanc[e] I have no shoes fit for the lofty soil Where my thoughts grazeâ No properly spun cluesânor well strained mid day oil Orâmust I mend my ways? It is a promised land which I have not yet earned, I have not made beginning With consecrated handâI have not even learned To lay the underpinning. The mountain sinks by dayâas do my lofty thoughts, Because I'm not highminded. If I could think alway above these hills &amp; warts I should see it, though blinded. It is a spiral path within the pilgrim's soul Leads to this mountain's brow Commencing at his hearth he reache[s] to this goal He knows not when nor how. STRANGE THAT SO MANY FICKLE GODS, AS FICKLE AS THE WEATHER Strange that so many fickle gods, as fickle as the weather, Throughout Dame Natures provinces should always pull together.

ALL THINGS DECAY All things decay &amp; so must our sleigh EXPECTATION No sound from my forge Has been heard in the gorge, But as a brittle cup I've held the hammer up. FOR THOUGH THE CAVES WERE RABITTED For though the caves were rabitted, And the well sweeps were slanted, Each house seemed not inhabited But haunted. The pensive traveller held his way, Silent &amp; melancholy, For every man an ideot was, And every house a folly. MY FRIENDS, MY NOBLE FRIENDS, KNOW YE My friends, my noble friends, know yeâ That in my waking hours I think of ye Ever[?] in godlike band uncompromised &amp; free NO EARNEST WORK THAT WILL EXPAND THE FRAME No earnest work that will expand the frame, And give a soundness to the muscles to[o]? How ye do waste your time! Pray make it wor[th] the while to live, Or worth the while to die. Show us great actions piled on high, Tasking our utmost strength touching the sky, As if we lived in a mountainous country. Hell were not quite so hard to bear If one were honored with its hottest place. And did ye fear ye should spoil Hell By making it sublime? GODFREY OF BOULOGNE The moon hung low o'er Provence vales, 'Twas night upon the sea, Fair France was woo'd by Afric gales And paid in minstrelsy. Along the Rhone then moves a band, Their banner in the breeze, Of mail-clad men with iron hand, And steel on breast and knees. The herdsman following his droves Far in the night alone, Read faintly through the olive groves,â 'Twas Godfrey of Boulogne The mist still slumbered on the heights The glaciers lay in shade, The stars withdrew with faded lights, The moon went down the glade. Proud Jura saw the day from far, And showed it to the plain; She heard the din of coming war, But told it not again. The goathered seated on the rocks, Dreaming of battles none Was wakened by his startled flocks,â 'Twas Godfrey of Boulogne. Night hung upon the Danube's stream, Deep midnight on the vales, Along the shore no beacons gleam, No sound is on the gales. The Turkish lord has banished care The harem sleeps profound, Save one fair Georgian sitting there Upon the Moslem ground. The lightning flashed a transient gleam, A glancing banner shone, A host swept swiftly down the stream,â 'Twas Godfrey of Boulogne. 'Twas noon upon Byzantium, On street and tower and sea, On Europe's edge a warlike hum Of gathered chivalry. A troop went boldly through the throng, Of Ethiops, Arabs, Huns, Jews Greeks and Turk, to right their wrong Their swords flashed thousand suns. Their banner cleaved Byzantium's dust, And like the sun it shone, Their armor had acquired no rust,â 'Twas Godfrey of Boulogne. WHO EQUALLEST THE COWARD'S HASTE Who equallest the coward's haste And still inspires the faintest heart Whose lofty fame is not disgraced Though it assume the lowest part IVE SEARCHED MY FACULTIES AROUND Ive searched my faculties around To learn why life to me was lent I will attend his faintest sound And then declare to man what God hath meant UNTIL AT LENGTH THE NORTH WINDS BLOW Until at length the north winds blow, And beating high mid ice and snow, The sturdy goose brings up the rear, Leaving behind the cold cold year. I WAS MADE ERECT AND LONE I was made erect and lone And within me is the bone Still my vision will be clear Still my life will not be drear To the center all is near Where I sit there is my throne If age choose to sit apart If age choose give me the start Take the sap and leave the heart WAIT NOT TILL SLAVES PRONOUNCE THE WORD Spes sibi quisque Each one his own hope Wait not till slaves pronounce the word To set the captive free, Be free yourselves, be not deferred, And farewell slavery. Ye are all slaves, ye have your price, And gang but cries to gang. Then rise, the highest of ye rise, I hear your fetters clang. Think not the tyrant sits afar In your own breasts ye have The District of Columbia And power to free the Slave. The warmest heart the north doth breed, Is still too cold and far, The colored man's release must come From outcast Africa. Make haste &amp; set the captive free!â Are ye so free that cry? The lowest depths of slavery Leave freedom for a sigh. What is your whole republic worth? Ye hold out vulgar lures, Why will ye be disparting earth When all of heaven is yours? He's governÃ©d well who rules himself, No despot vetoes him, There's no defaulter steals his pelf, Nor revolution grim. 'Tis neither silver rags nor gold 'S the better currency, The only specie that will hold Is current honesty. The minister of state hath cares, He cannot get release, Administer his own affairs, Nor settle his own peace, 'Tis easier to treat with kings, And please our country's foes, Than treat with conscience of the things Which only conscience knows. There's but the party of the great, And party of the mean, And if there is an Empire State 'Tis the upright, I ween. TO THE MOUNTAINS And when the sun puts out his lamp We'll sleep serene within the camp, Trusting to his invet'rate skill Who leads the stars oer yonder hill, Whose discipline doth never cease To watch the slumberings of peace, And from the virtuous hold afar The melancholy din of war.â For ye our sentries still outlie, The earth your pallet and your screen the sky. From steadfastness I will not swerve Remembering my sweet reserve. With all your kindness shown from year to year Ye do but civil demons still appear, Still to my mind Ye are inhuman and unkind, And bear an untamed aspect to my sight After the âcivil-suitedâ night As if ye had lain out Like to the Indian scout Who lingers in the purlieus of the towns With unexplored grace and savage frowns. THE FRIEND The great friend Dwells at the land's end, There lives he Next to the Sea. Fleets come and go, Carrying commerce to and fro, But still sits he on the sand And maketh firm that headland. Mariners steer them by his light Safely in the darkest night, He holds no visible communion For his friendship is a union. Many men dwell far inland, But he alone sits on the strand, Whether he ponders men or books Ever still he seaward looks, Feels the sea-breeze on his cheek, At each word the landsmen speak; From some distant port he hears Of the ventures of past years In this the sullen ocean's roar Of wrecks upon a distant shore; In every companions eye A sailing vessel doth descry; Marine news he ever reads And the slightest glances heeds. Near is India to him Though his native shore is dim, But the bark which long was due, Neverâneverâheaves in view, Which shall put an end to commerce And bring back what it took from us, (Which shall make Siberia free Of the climes beyond the Sea) Fetch the Indies in its hold, All their spices and their gold, And men sail the sea no more The sea itself become a shore, To a broader deeper sea, A profounder mystery. UPON THE BANK AT EARLY DAWN Upon the bank at early dawn I hear the cocks proclaim the day, Though the moon shines securely on, As if her course they could not stay. The stars withhold their shining not Or singly or in scattered crowds, But seem like Parthian arrows shot By yielding Night mid the advancing clouds. Far in the east their larum rings, As if a wakeful host were there, And now its early clarion sings To warn us sluggard knights beware. One on more distant perch, more clear, But fainter, brags him still, But ah, he promises, I fear, More than her master's household will fulfil. The sound invades each silent wood, Awakes each slumbering bird, Till every fowl leads forth her brood, Which on her nest the tuneful summons heard. Methinks that Time has reached his prime, Eternity is in the flower, And this the faint, confused chime That ushers in the sacred hour. And has Time got so forward then? From what perennial fount of joy, Dost thou inspire the hearts of men, And teach them how the daylight to employ? From thy abundance pray impart, Who dost so freely spill, Some bravery unto my heart, And let me taste of thy perennial rill. There is such health and length of years In the elixir of thy note, That God himself more young appears, From the rare bragging of thy throat. BETWEEN THE TRAVELLER AND THE SETTING SUN Between the traveller and the setting sun, Upon some drifting sand heap of the shore, A hound stands o'er the carcass of a man. MUST WE STILL EAT Must we still eat The bread we have spurned? Must we re kindle The faggots we've burned? I'M CONTENTED YOU SHOULD STAY I'm contented you should stay For ever and aye If you can take yourself away Any day. HE KNOWS NO CHANGE WHO KNOWS THE TRUE He knows no change who knows the true, And on it keeps his eye, Who always still the unseen doth view; Only the false &amp; the apparent die. Things change, but change not far From what they are not but to what they are, Or rather 'tis our ignorance that dies; Forever lives the knowledge of the wise. THE DEPARTURE In this roadstead I have ridden In this covert I have hidden Friendly thoughts were cliffs to me And I hid beneath their lea. This true people took the stranger And warm hearted housed the ranger They received their roving guest, And have fed him with the best Whatsoe'er the land afforded To the stranger's wish accorded, Shook the olive, stripped the vine, And expressed the strengthening wine. And at night they did spread o'er him What by day they spread before him, That good-will which was repast Was his covering at last. The stranger moored him to their pier Without anxiety or fear; By day he walked the sloping land, By night the gentle heavens he scanned. When first his bark stood inland To the coast of this far Finland, Sweet-watered brooks came tumbling to the shore The weary mariner to restore. And still he stayed from day to day If he their kindness might repay But more and more The sullen waves came rolling to the shore. And still the more the stranger waited The less his argosy was freighted, And still the more he stayed The less his debt was paid. So He unfurled his mast To receive the fragrant blast, And that same refreshing gale Which had woo'd him to remain Again and againâ It was that filled his sail And drove him to the main. All day the low hung clouds Dropt tears into the sea And the wind amid the shrouds Sighed plaintively. THE FUNERAL BELL One more is gone Out of the busy throng That tread these paths; The church bell tolls, Its sad knell rolls To many hearths. Flower bells toll not, Their echoes roll not Unto my ear;â There still perchance, That gentle spirit haunts A fragrant bier. Low lies the pall, Lowly the mourners all Their passage grope;â No sable hue Mars the serene blue Of heaven's cope. In distant dell Faint sounds the funeral bell, A heavenly chime; Some poet there Weaves the light burthened air Into sweet rhyme. THE VIRGIN With her calm, aspiring eyes She doth tempt the earth to rise, With humility over all, She doth tempt the sky to fall. In her place she still doth stand A pattern unto the firm land While revolving spheres come round To embrace her stable ground. SPEECH OF A SAXON EALDERMAN This life, O king, of men on earth, Compared with that unknown, Gave to a pleasant fancy birth, Close by thy throne. The hall is swept, The table set, And anxious guests are there, With shrinking forms, For wintry storms Go howling through the air. Thy noble Ealderman and Thegnes A cheerful blaze prepare, And while without it snows and rains Are merry there. And presently a sparrow comes And flutters through the hall, It barely picks the scattered crumbs, And that is all. The while the hall it flies about, It laughs the cold to scorn, But soon it goes a window out, And summer's gone. So is it with this life of men, Thus do our moments fly, We flutter round the hall, and then We pine, and die. If this new lore can tell us where We go when summer's gone, Or how this soul of ours did fare Ere we were born, If it do this, then should we try To live as may befit, So I, for one, gladly do cry, Welcome be it! FAREWELL Whether we've far withdrawn Or come more near Equally the outward form Doth no more appear. Not thou by distance lost Noâfor regret doth bind Me faster to thee now Than neighborhood confined. Where thy love followeth me Is enough society. [?] Thy indelible mild eye Is my sky. Whether by land or sea I wander to and fro, Oft as I think of thee The heavens hang more low The pure glance of thy eye Doth purge the summer's sky, And thy breath so rare Doth refine the winter's air. my feet would weary be Ere they travelled from thee. I [discover] by thy face That we are of one race Flowed in one vein our blood Ere the sea found its flood The worm may [be] divided And each part become a whole, But the nobler creature man May not separate a span. NATURE O nature I do not aspire To be the highest in thy quire, To be a meteor in the sky Or comet that may range on high, Only a zephyr that may blow Among the reeds by the river low. Give me thy most privy place Where to run my airy race. In some withdrawn unpublic mead Let me sigh upon a reed, Or in the [?] woods with leafy din Whisper the still evening in, For I had rather be thy child And pupil in the forest wild Than be the king of men elsewhere And most sovereign slave of care To have one moment of thy dawn Than share the city's year forlorn. Some still work give me to do Only be it near to you. GUIDO'S AURORA The God of day rolls his car up the slopes, Reining his prancing steeds with steady hand, The moon's pale orb through western shadows gropes, While morning sheds its light o'er sea and land. Castles and cities by the sounding main Resound with all the busy din of life, The fisherman unfurls his sails again And the recruited warrior bides the strife. The early breeze ruffles the poplar leaves, The curling waves reflect the washed [?] light, The slumbering sea with the day's impulse heaves, While o'er the western hills retires the drowsy night. The sea birds dip their bills in ocean's foam, Far circling out over the frothy wavesâ GREECE When life contracts into a vulgar span And human nature tires to be a man, I thank the gods for Greece That permanent realm of peace, For as the rising moon far in the night Checquers the shade with her forerunning light, So in my darkest hour my senses seem To catch from her Acropolis a gleam. Greece who am I that should remember thee? Thy Marathon and thy Thermopylae Is my life vulgar my fate mean Which on such golden memories can lean? POVERTY If I am poor it is that I am proud, If God has made me naked and a boor He did not think it fit his work to shroud. The poor man comes from heaven direct to earth As stars drop down the sky and tropic beams. The rich receives in our gross air his birth, As from low suns are slanted golden gleams. Men are by birth equal in this that given Themselves and their condition they are even. The less of inward essence is to leaven The more of outward circumstance is given. Yon sun is naked bare of satellite Unless our earths and moons that office hold, Though his perpetual day feareth no night And his perennial summer dreads no cold. Where are his gilded rays but in our sky? His solid disk doth float far from us still, The orb which through the central way doth fly Shall naked seem [?] though proudly circumstanced. Ill leave my mineral wealth hoarded in earth? Buried in seas in mines and ocean caves More safely kept than is the merchant's worth, Which every storm committeth to the waves. Man kind may delve but cannot my wealth spend, If I no partial store appropriate no armed ships into the Indies send To rob me of my orient estate The rich man's clothes keep out the genial sun But scarce defend him from the piercing cold If he did not his heavenly garment shun He would not need to hide beneath a fold. I'M NOT ALONE I'm not alone If I stand by myself, But more than one, And not [?] in my own pelf. I'm understood If my intent is good, For who obeys The truth finds his own praise. WHAT SOUGHT TH[E]Y TH[U]S AFAR What sought th[e]y th[u]s afar They sought a faith's pure shrine. Seek! shall I seek! The Gods above should give, They have enough &amp; w[e] do poorly live. âI ask today for no external thing For sight of upland hill and waving tree, I do not wish to see the glancing wing Of bird nor hear with trembling heart her melody, I ask for that which is our whole life's light, for the perpetual, true, &amp; clear insight.â Away! away! Thou speakest to me of things which in all my endless life I have found not and shall not find. [Word] to Music Thy lot, or portion of life, is seeking after thee; therefore be at rest from seeking after it. [Word?] MUSIC Far from this atmosphere that music sounds Bursting some azure chink in the dull clouds Of sense that overarch my recent years And steal his freshness from the noonday sun. Ah, I have wandered many ways and lost The boyant step, the whole responsive life That stood with joy to hear what seemed then Its echo, its own harmony borne back Upon its ear. This tells of better space, Far far beyond the hills the woods the clouds That bound my low and plodding valley life, Far from my sin, remote from my distrust, When first my healthy morning life perchance Trod lightly as on clouds, and not as yet My weary and faint hearted noon had sunk Upon the clod while the bright day went by. Lately, I feared my life was empty, now I know though a frail tenement that it still Is worth repair, if yet its hollowness Doth entertain so fine a guest within, and through Its empty aisles there still doth ring Though but the echo of so high a strain; It shall be swept again and cleansed from sin To be a thoroughfare for celestial airs; Perchance the God who is proprietor Will pity take on his poor tenant here And countenance his efforts to improve His property and make it worthy to revert, At some late day Unto himself again. I'M THANKFUL THAT MY LIFE DOTH NOT DECEIVE I'm thankful that my life doth not deceive Itself with a low loftiness, half height, And think it soars when still it dip its way Beneath the clouds on noiseless pinion Like the crow or owl, but it doth know The full extent of all its trivialness, Compared with the splendid heights above. See how it waits to watch the mail come in While 'hind its back the sun goes out perchance. And yet their lumbering cart brings me no word Not one scrawled leaf such as my neighbors get To cheer them with the slight events forsooth Faint ups and downs of their far distant friendsâ And now tis passed. What next? See the long train Of teams wreathed in dust, their atmosphere; Shall I attend until the last is passed? Else why these ears that hear the leader's bells Or eyes that link me in procession. But hark! the drowsy day has done its task, Far in yon hazy field where stands a barn Unanxious hens improve the sultry hour And with contented voice now brag their deedâ A new laid eggâNow let the day declineâ Th[e]y'll lay another by tomorrow's sun. MANHOOD I love to see the man, a long-lived child, As yet uninjured by all worldly taint As the fresh infant whose whole life is play. 'Tis a serene spectacle for a serene day; But better still I love to contemplate The mature soul of lesser innocence, Who hath travelled far on life's dusty road Far from the starting point of infancy And proudly bears his small degen'racy Blazon'd on his memorial standard high Who from the sad experience of his fate Since his bark struck on that unlucky rock Has proudly steered his life with his own hands. Though his face harbors less of innocence Yet there do chiefly lurk within its depths Furrowed by care, but yet all over spread With the ripe bloom of a self-wrought content Noble resolves which do reprove the gods And it doth more assert man's eminence Above the happy level of the brute And more doth advertise me of the heights To which no natural path doth ever lead No natural light can ever light our steps, âBut the far-piercing ray that shines From the recesses of a brave man's eye. THE MOON MOVES UP HER SMOOTH AND SHEENY PATH The moon moves up her smooth and sheeny path Without impediment; and happily The brook Glides by lulled by its tinkling; Meteeors drop down the sky without chagrin And rise again; but my cares never rest. No charitable laws alas cut me An easy orbit round the sun, but I Must make my way through rocks and seas and earth my steep and devious way Uncertain still. My current never rounds into a lake In whose fair heart the heavens come to bathe Nor does my life drop freely but a rod[?] By its resistless course As Meteors do. LIFE My life is like a stately warrior horse, That walks with fluent pace along the way, And I the upright horseman that bestrides His flexuous back, feeding my private thoughts.â Alas, when will this rambling head and neck Be welded to that firm and brawny breast?â But still my steady steed goes proudly forth, Mincing his stately steps along the road; The sun may set, the silver moon may rise, But my unresting steed holds on his way. He is far gone ere this, you fain would say, He is far going. Plants grow and rivers run; You ne'er may look upon the ocean waves, At morn or eventide, but you will see Far in th' horizon with expanded sail, Some solitary bark stand out to sea, Far boundâwell so my life sails far, To double some far cape not yet explored. A cloud ne'er standeth in the summer's sky, The eagle sailing high, with outspread wings Cleaving the silent air, resteth him not A moment in his flight, the air is not his perch. Nor doth my life fold its unwearied wings, And hide its head within its downy breast, But still it plows the shoreless seas of time, Breasting the waves with an unsanded bow. PRAY TO WHAT EARTH DOES THIS SWEET COLD BELONG Pray to what earth does this sweet cold belong, Which asks no duties and no conscience? The moon goes up by leaps her cheerful path In some far summer stratum of the sky, While stars with their cold shine bedot her way. The fields gleam mildly back upon the sky, And far and near upon the leafless shrubs The snow dust still emits a silvery light. Under the hedge, where drift banks are their screen, The titmice now pursue their downy dreams, As often in the sweltering summer nights The bee doth drop asleep in the flower cup, When evening overtakes him with his load. By the brooksides, in the still genial night, The more adventurous wanderer may hear The crystals shoot and form, and winter slow Increase his rule by gentlest summer means. WHEN THE OAKS ARE IN THE GRAY When the oaks are in the gray Then Farmers plant away. INSPIRATION Whate'er we leave to God, God does, And blesses us; The work we choose should be our own, God lets alone. If with light head erect I sing, Though all the muses lend their force, From my poor love of anything, The verse is weak and shallow as its source. But if with bended neck I grope, Listening behind me for my wit, With faith superior to hope, More anxious to keep back than forward it, Making my soul accomplice there Unto the flame my heart hath lit, Then will the verse forever wear,â Time cannot bend the line which God hath writ. Always the general show of things Floats in review before my mind, And such true love and reverence brings, That sometimes I forget that I am blind. But now there comes unsought, unseen, Some clear, divine electuary, And I who had but sensual been, Grow sensible, and as God is, am wary. I hearing get who had but ears, And sight, who had but eyes before, I moments live who lived but years, And truth discern who knew but learning's lore. I hear beyond the range of sound, I see beyond the range of sight, New earths and skies and seas around, And in my day the sun doth pale his light. A clear and ancient harmony Pierces my soul through all its din, As through its utmost melody,â Farther behind than theyâfarther within. More swift its bolt than lightning is, Its voice than thunder is more loud, It doth expand my privacies To all, and leave me single in the crowd. It speaks with such authority, With so serene and lofty tone, That idle Time runs gadding by, And leaves me with Eternity alone. Then chiefly is my natal hour, And only then my prime of life, Of manhood's strength it is the flower, 'Tis peace's end and war's beginning strife. 'T 'hath come in summer's broadest noon, By a grey wall or some chance place, Unseasoned time, insulted June, And vexed the day with its presuming face. Such fragrance round my couch it makes, More rich than are Arabian drugs, That my soul scents its life and wakes The body up beneath its perfumed rugs. Such is the Museâthe heavenly maid, The star that guides our mortal course, Which shows where life's true kernel's laid, Its wheat's fine flower, and its undying force. She with one breath attunes the spheres, And also my poor human heart, With one impulse propels the years Around, and gives my throbbing pulse its start. I will not doubt forever more, Nor falter from a steadfast faith, For though the system be turned o'er, God takes not back the word which once he saith. I will then trust the love untold Which not my worth nor want has bought, Which wooed me young and woos me old, And to this evening hath me brought. My memory I'll educate To know the one historic truth, Remembering to the latest date The only true and sole immortal youth. Be but thy inspiration given, No matter through what danger sought, I'll fathom hell or climb to heaven, And yet esteem that cheap which love has bought. Fame cannot tempt the bard Who's famous with his God, Nor laurel him reward Who hath his Maker's nod. INSPIRATION If thou wilt but stand by my ear, When through the field thy anthem's rung, When that is done I will not fear But the same power will abet my tongue. DELAY No generous action can delay Or thwart our higher, steadier aims, But if sincere and true are they, It will arouse our sight and nerve our frames. THE FALL OF THE LEAF Thank God who seasons thus the year, And sometimes kindly slants his rays; For in his winter he's most near And plainest seen upon the shortest days. Who gently tempers now his heats, And then his harsher cold, lest we Should surfeit on the summer's sweets, Or pine upon the winter's crudity. A sober mind will walk alone, Apart from nature, if need be, And only its own seasons own; For nature leaving its humanity. Sometimes a late autumnal thought Has crossed my mind in green July, And to its early freshness brought Late ripened fruits, and an autumnal sky. The evening of the year draws on, The fields a later aspect wear; Since Summer's garishness is gone, Some grains of night tincture the noontide air. Behold! the shadows of the trees Now circle wider 'bout their stem, Like sentries that by slow degrees Perform their rounds, gently protecting them. And as the year doth decline, The sun allows a scantier light; Behind each needle of the pine There lurks a small auxiliar to the night. I hear the cricket's slumbrous lay Around, beneath me, and on high; It rocks the night, it soothes the day, And everywhere is Nature's lullaby. But most he chirps beneath the sod, When he has made his winter bed; His creak grown fainter but more broad, A film of autumn o'er the summer spread. Small birds, in fleets migrating by, Now beat across some meadow's bay, And as they tack and veer on high, With faint and hurried click beguile the way. Far in the woods, these golden days, Some leaf obeys its Maker's call; And through their hollow aisles it plays With delicate touch the prelude of the Fall. Gently withdrawing from its stem, Its lightly lays itself along Where the same hand hath pillowed them, Resigned to sleep upon the old year's throng. The loneliest birch is brown and sere, The furthest pool is strewn with leaves, Which float upon their watery bier, Where is no eye that sees, no heart that grieves. The jay screams through the chestnut wood; The crisped and yellow leaves around Are hue and texture of my moodâ And these rough burrs my heirlooms on the ground. The threadbare trees, so poor and thinâ They are no wealthier than I; But with as brave a core within They rear their boughs to the October sky. Poor knights they are which bravely wait The charge of Winter's cavalry, Keeping a simple Roman state, Discumbered of their Persian luxury. A WINTER AND SPRING SCENE The willows droop, The alders stoop, The pheasants group Beneath the snow; The fishes glide From side to side, In the clear tide, The ice below. The ferret weeps, The marmot sleeps, The owlet keeps In his snug nook. The rabbit leaps, The mouse out-creeps, The flag out-peeps, Beside the brook. The snow-dust falls, The otter crawls, The partridge calls Far in the wood; The traveller dreams, The tree-ice gleams, The blue jay screams In angry mood. The apples thaw, The ravens caw, The squirrels gnaw The frozen fruit; To their retreat I track the feet Of mice that eat The apple's root. The axe resounds, And bay of hounds, And tinkling sounds Of wintry fame; The hunter's horn Awakes the dawn On field forlorn, And frights the game. The tinkling air Doth echo bear To rabbit's lair, With dreadful din; She scents the air, And far doth fare, Returning where She did begin. The fox stands still Upon the hill Not fearing ill From trackless wind. But to his foes The still wind shows In treacherous snows His tracks behind. Now melts the snow In the warm sun. The meadows flow, The streamlets run. The spring is born, The wild bees bum, The insects hum, And trees drop gum. And winter's gone, And summer's come. The chic-a-dee Lisps in the tree, The winter bee Not fearing frost; The small nuthatch The bark doth scratch Some worm to catch At any cost. The catkins green Cast o'er the scene A summer sheen, A genial glow. I melt, I flow, And rippling run, Like melting snow In this warm sun. WHY DO THE SEASONS CHANGE? AND WHY Why do the seasons change? and why Does Winter's stormy brow appear? Is it the word of him on high, Who rules the changing varied year. FRIENDS! THAT PARTING TEAR RESERVE IT Friends! that parting tear reserve it, Tho' 'tis doubly dear to me! Could I think I did deserve it, How much happier would I be. IN ADAMS FALL In Adams fall We sinned all. In the new Adam's rise We shall all reach the skies. IN TIMES OF YORE, 'TIS SAID, THE SWIMMING ALDER In times of yore, 'tis said, the swimming Alder, Fashioned rude, with branches lopt, and stript Of its smooth coat,â Where fallen tree was not, and rippling stream's Vast breadth forbade adventurous leap, The brawny swain did bear secure to farthest shore. The Book has passed away, And with the book the lay, Which in my youthful days I loved to ponder; Of curious things it told, How wise Men Three of old, (Gotham) In bowl did venture out to sea,â And darkly hints their future fate. If men have dared the Main to tempt In such frail bark, why may not washtub round, Or bread-trough square? oblong?âsuffice to cross The purling wave? and gain the destined port. BY HIS GOOD GENIUS PROMPTED OR THE POWER By his good genius prompted or the power That fills the mind with ADDED POEMS FAIR HAVEN When little hills like lambs did skip, And Joshua ruled in heaven, Unmindful rolled Musketuquid, Nor budged an inch Fair Haven. When principle is like to yield, To selfish fear, or craven, And fickle mortals round me fall, I'll not forget Fair Haven. If there's a cliff in this wide world, 'S, a stepping stone to heaven, A pleasant, craggy, short hand cut, It sure must be Fair Haven. Oft have I climbed thy craggy steep, Where ceaseless wheels the raven, And whiled away an hour at e'en, For love of thee, Fair Haven. If e'er my bark be tempest-tossed, And every hope the wave in, And this frail hulk shall spring a leak, I'll steer for thee, Fair Haven. When cares press heavy on my soul, And devils blue are craven, Or e'er I lay me down to rest, I'll think of thee, Fair Haven. And when I take my last long rest, And quiet sleep my grave in, What kindlier covering for my breast, Than thy warm turf Fair Haven. LIFE IS A SUMMER'S DAY Life is a summer's day When as it were for aye We sport and play. Anon the night comes on, The ploughman's work is done, And day is gone. We read in this one page Both Youth, Manhood, and Age That hoary Sage. The morning is our prime, That laughs to scorn old Time, And knows no crime. The noon comes on apace, And then with swel'tring face We run our race. When eve comes stealing o'er We ponder at our door On days of yore. The patient kine, they say, At dawn do frisk and play, And well they may. By noon their sports abate, For then, as bards relate, They vegetate. When eventide hath come, And grey flies cease their hum, And now are dumb, They leave the tender bud, That's cooling to the blood, And chew the cud. Let's make the most of morn, Ere grey flies wind their horn, And it is gone. I'VE HEARD MY NEIGHBOR'S PUMP AT NIGHT I've heard my neighbor's pump at night, Long after Lyra sunk her light, As if it were a natural sound, And proper utterance of the groundâ Perchance some bittern in a fenâ Or else the squeak of a meadow hen. Who sleeps by day and walks by night, Will meet no spirit but some sprite. WHEN WITH PALE CHEEK AND SUNKEN EYE I SANG When with pale cheek and sunken eye I sang Unto the slumbering world at midnights hour, How it no more resounded with war's clang, And virtue was decayed in Peace's bower; How in these days no hero was abroad, But puny men, afraid of war's alarms, Stood forth to fight the battles of their Lord, Who scarce could stand beneath a hero's arms; A faint, reproachful, reassuring strain, From some harp's strings touched by unskilful hands Brought back the days of chivalry again, And the surrounding fields made holy lands. A bustling camp and an embattled host Extending far on either hand I saw, For I alone had slumbered at my post, Dreaming of peace when all around was war. I AROSE BEFORE LIGHT I arose before light To work with all my might, With my arms braced for toil Which no obstacle could foil, For it robbed me of my rest Like an anvil on my breast. But as a brittle cup I've held the hammer up, And no sound from my forge Has been heard in the gorge. I look forward into night, And seem to get some light; E're long the forge will ring With its ding-dong-ding, For the iron will be hot And my wages will be got. I WILL OBEY THE STRICTEST LAW OF LOVE I will obey the strictest law of love As if I dealt with cherubim above. I will accept no half gift from my friend By which he thinks for hate to make amend. But every friendly thought Will come to me unbought My friend may do whate'er he will And I shall love him If he doth it from love. But let him do whateer he will I think that I must hate him still If lower motives move. I love not all I love not one alway But that I love is one &amp; all And lasteth ever and aye. I will leave him I hate And cleave to him I love I will forsake my earthly mate And seek my mate above. Though my friends are dull and cold I will be quick and warm. Though their love groweth old Mine shall be new born Though they understand me not I shall be understood Though by them I am forgot Not therefore by the good. My friend can wound me For to him I bare my breastâ But his wounds save me From a foe's embrace But these are honorable scars And fit the wounded heart for Love's more glorious wars. These wounds are not fatal though inflicted on the heart For the heart's not less a vital than a mortal part. Unlike the inferior part The wounded heart Is not repaired with wood But by fresh currents from above Which fit it for a purer love For all that's true &amp; beautiful &amp; good. THE CENTAUR Alas, when will this roving head &amp; breast Be welded to that firm &amp; brawny beast? The sun may set the silver moon may rise But my unresting steed holds on his way He is far gone ere this, then, you would say. He is far going. The eagle sailing high with outspread wings cleaving the silent air, Resteth him not An instant in his flight, the air is not his perch No more my steed slackening his onward pace Dismounts his rider by the tedious way my bark neer furls its weatherbeaten sails And rest[s] its keel upon a friendly shoreâ But still it plows the shoreless seas of timeâ Breasting the waves with an unsanded prow WHO HEARS THE PARSON Who hears the parson Will not hear the bell, But if he deafly pass on He will hear of hell. I' faith the people go to church To leave the devil in the lurch, But since they've carpeted the pews To squat with hymn book he doth use. FRIENDS Friendsâ They cannot help, They cannot hurt, Nor in indifference rest, But when for a host's service girt, They are a mutual guest. They are a single power Plenipotentiary, No minister of state, Anxious and wary Decides their fate. Where interest's self is There is no go-between, But where another reaps, They do but glean In scanty heaps. They have learned well to hate, And never grant reprieve, Nor e'er succumb to love, But sternly grieve, And look above. If faults arise, my friend will send for me As some great god, Who will the matter try, Holding the scales, even or odd, Under the skyâ Who will award strict justice All the while, Confounding mine and thine, And share his smile, When they 'gainst me incline. WHEN IN SOME COVE I LIE When in some cove I lie, A placid lake at rest, Scanning the distant hills, A murmur from the west, And gleam of thousand rills Which gently swell my breast, Announce the friendly thought, And in one wave sun-lit I'm softly brought Seaward with it. DELAY IN FRIENDSHIP The blossoms on the tree Swell not too fast for me. God does not want quick work but sure Not to be tempted by so cheap a lure. Owing to slow steps I shall be never By my friend out run, More than the tide can land from ocean sever, Or earth distance the sun. The friend is patient, he can stay Some centuries yet, Though then I may not get So on my way As fit to be his mate. Wilt thou not wait for me my friend, Or give a longer lease? Why think I can wait for myself, If so I please. Now as ye take one step away Thinking to leave me hereâ The heavens will still beyond ye lay, And though ye are far they will be near. Ye will be pilgrims on the road Whither my heart has single gone, And never looks back from its abode On ye thus left forlorn. Love equals swift and slow And high &amp; lowâ Racer and lameâ The hunter and his game. TO EDITH Thou little bud of being, Edith named, With whom I've made acquaintance on this earth, Who knowest me without impediment, As flowers know the winds that stir their leaves, And rid'st upon my shoulders as the sphere, Turning on me thy sage reserved eye, Behind whose broad &amp; charitable gaze Floats the still true &amp; universal soul With the pure azure of the general day, Not yet a peopled &amp; a vulgar town, Rather a pure untarnished country ground; For thou art whole, not yet begun to die, While men look on me with their shrivelled rays Streaming through some small chink of the broad sky; Pure youthful soul, thou hast begun to be, To cumulate thy sin &amp; piety. THE ROSA SANGUINEA As often as a martyr dies, This opes its petals to the skies; And Nature by this trace alone Informs us which way he is gone.</field>
