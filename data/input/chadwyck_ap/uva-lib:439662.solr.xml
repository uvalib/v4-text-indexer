      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF THE WAR. THE FIRST MARTYR. My five-years' darling, on my knee, Chattered and toyed and laughed with me: âNow tell me, mother mine,â quoth she, âWhere you went i' the afternoon.â âAlas! my pretty little life, I went to see a sorrowing wife, Who will be widowed soon.â âNow, mother, what is that?â she said, With wondering eyes and restless head: âWill, then, her husband soon be dead? Tell me, why must he die? Is he like flowers the frost doth sear, Or like the birds, that, every year, Melt back into the sky?â âNo, love: the flowers may bloom their time, The birdlings sing their merry chime, Till bids them seek another clime The Winter sharp and cold; But he who waits with fettered limb, Nor God nor Nature sends for him,â He is not weak nor old. âHe lies upon a prison bed With sabre gashes on his head; And one short month will see him led Where Vengeance wields the sword. Then shall his form be lifted high, And strangled in the public eye With horrible accord.â âBut, mother, say, what has he done? Has he not robbed or murdered one?â âMy darling, he has injured none. To free the wretched slaves He led a band of chosen men, Brave, but too few; made captives then, And doomed to felon graves.â âO mother! let us go this day To that sad prison, far away; The cruel governor we'll pray To unloose the door so stout. Some comfort we can bring him, sure: And is he locked up so secure, We could not get him out?â âNo, darling: he is closely kept.â Then nearer to my heart she crept, And, hiding there her beauty, wept For human misery. Child! it is fit that thou shouldst weep; The very babe unborn would leap To rescue such as he. O babe unborn! O future race! Heir of our glory and disgrace, We cannot see thy veilÃ¨d face; But shouldst thou keep our crime, No new Apocalypse need say In what wild woe shall pass away The falsehood of the time. APRIL 19. A spasm o'er my heart Sweeps like a burning flood; A sentence rings upon mine ears, Avenge the guiltless blood! Sit not in health and ease, Nor reckon loss nor gain, When men who bear our country's flag Are set upon and slain, Not by mistaken hearts With long oppression wrung, Filled with great thoughts that ripen late, And madden, when they're young. The murderer's wicked lust Their righteous steps withstood; The zeal that thieves and pirates know Brought down the guiltless blood. From every vein of mine Its fiery burthen take; From every drop the burning coin Of righteous vengeance make. Low let the city lie That thus her guests receives; A smoking ruin to the eye Be marble walls and eaves! Thou God of love and wrath, That watchest on the wing, Remorseless at those caitiff hearts Thy bolts of judgment fling! Blot from the sight of heaven The city, where she stood, And with thy might, avenging Right, Wipe out the guiltless blood! REQUITAL. He died beneath the uplifted thong Who spared for us a thousand lives: He came to sing glad Israel's song; We gave him Babylonian gyves. With swelling heart and simple thought He warned us of the unheeded snare Our chiefs discovered: vilely caught, They flung him back to perish there. Did Pilate seal the Saviour's fate As still the shuddering Nations say, When, in that hour of high debate, With ill-washed hands he turned away? Sweet Christ, with flagellations brought To thine immortal martyrdom, Cancel the bitter treasons wrought By men who bid thy kingdom come. Their sinful blood we may not urge While Mercy stays thy righteous hand; But take all ours, if that should purge The wicked patience of the land. THE QUESTION. Tell me, Master, am I free? From the prison land I come, From a mocked humanity, From the fable of a home; From the shambles, where my wife With my baby at her breast, Faded from my narrow life, Rudely bartered, ill-possest. Will you keep me, for my faith, From the hound that scents my track, From the riotous, drunken breath, From the murder at my back? Masters, ye are fighting long; Well your trumpet-blast we know; Are ye come to right a wrong? Do we call you friend or foe? God must come, for whom we pray, Knowing his deliverance true; Shall our men be left to say He must work it free of you? Fetters of a burning chain Held the spirit of our braves; Waiting for the nobler strain, Silence told him we were slaves. HARVARD STUDENT'S SONG. Remember ye the fateful gun that sounded To Sumter's walls from Charleston's treacherous shore? Remember ye how hearts indignant bounded When our first dead came back from Baltimore? The banner fell that every breeze had flattered, The hum of thrift was hushed with sudden woe; We raised anew the emblems shamed and shattered, And turned a front resolved to meet the foe. Remember ye how, out of boyhood leaping, Our gallant mates stood ready for the fray, As new-fledged eaglets rise, with sudden sweeping, And meet unscared the dazzling front of day? Our classic toil became inglorious leisure, We praised the calm Horatian ode no more, But answered back with song the martial measure, That held its throb above the cannon's roar. Remember ye the pageants dim and solemn, Where Love and Grief have borne the funeral pall? The joyless marching of the mustered column, With arms reversed, to Him who conquers all? Oh! give them back, thou bloody breast of Treason, They were our own, the darlings of our hearts: They come benumbed and frosted out of season, With whom the summer of our youth departs. Look back no more! our time has come, my brothers! In Fate's high roll our names are written too: We fill the mournful gaps left bare by others, The ranks where Fear has never broken through. Look, ancient Walls, upon our stern election! Keep, Echoes dear, remembrance of our breath! And gentle eyes, and hearts of pure affection, Light us resolved to victory or death! ONE AND MANY. He is dead with whom we spake; Ere the latest war cloud brake, Vanished, with the smile he wore When we parted evermore. As a star that leaves its place Fills the heavens with passing grace, Did he set our hearts aglow, Loving loath to see him go. Where he was, a shadow rests, Veiling void in aching breasts: He but heeds the immortal rule, Lifted to the Beautiful! LEFT BEHIND. The foe is retreating, the field is clear; My thoughts fly like lightning, my steps stay here; I'm bleeding to faintness, no help is near: What, ho! comrades; what, ho! The battle was deadly, the shots fell thick; We leaped from our trenches, and charged them quick; I knew not my wound till my heart grew sick: So there, comrades; so there. We charged the left column, that broke and fled; Poured powder for powder, and lead for lead: So they must surrender, what matter who's dead? Who cares, comrades? who cares? My soul rises up on the wings of the slain, A triumph thrills through me that quiets the pain: If it were yet to do, I would do it again! Farewell, comrades, farewell! HYMN FOR A SPRING FESTIVAL, MAY 27, 1862. In this glad time of Spring Nature doth garlands bring, Crowning her joys. All that was seared with frost, Buried, and mourned for lost, With a new Pentecost, Flame-touched, doth rise. Come, then, ye sons of men! Stand, and take heart again, Blessing the year. Earth fills her breast with food; Odors enchant the wood; Each leafy solitude Music doth cheer. Where the war-trumpets blow, Our legions meet the foe With deathful din; But hosts unseen are there, Fight and fatigue to share: So we but strive with prayer, Steadfast, we win. O hearts that wonder long! O Truth that sufferest wrong! Meet in your might; Lift the pure banner high; Raise one impassioned cry, Nobler than victory,â âGod speed the right!â Through the dark years of crime, For this appointed time Justice did wait. Purpose and Hope, that lay Passive and dumb as clay, Stand, in God's chosen day, Stronger than Fate. We then, with faith increased, Hold our fraternal feast, Death making sign, Solemn as when he stood Where our Supremest Good Bade memory count his blood Dearer than wine. All glories, Lord! are thine; All joys are throbs divine Pulsed from thy breast. As thine infinity, Peace-crowned, returns to thee, Let our toil gathered be Into thy rest. THE JEWELLER'S SHOP IN WAR-TIME. Past these counters wilt thou lead me, Notes of luxury to read me In the pearly shows and golden That to outward boast embolden? Watchful sit the shapes of sorrow. Say: the Black Death comes to-morrow. Bride, the altar-gifts are waiting The permission of thy mating; Heart and purse make brief unclasping From the daily miser-grasping. Fill the cup! away with sorrow! Will the Black Death come to-morrow? Lo! he lies in bloody heather, 'Neath the burning summer weather: Not a drop his dry lip wetteth; Dryer yet his sad eye setteth. Rend thy bridal robes for sorrow: Doth the Black Death wait the morrow? See! the silver vessels goodly Hands of hirelings stir not rudely; Gems that deck the board's white wearing, In a house of noble bearing; Legendary urns of sorrow: Death attends the feast to-morrow! See! the rings of wild desire,â Dreamy opal; diamond fire; Emerald, green as summer grasses Lit of sun that never passes; Jets, the dim delights of sorrow, That the Black Death buys, the morrow. Chalice see and salver ghostly That affright the gazer mostly; Stirrup-cup that awes and blesses, Cordial drop of last distresses; Pearl of hope dissolved in sorrow, Dear where Death is due the morrow. Take me rather when the hours Write their journal fair in flowers; Where our sweet joys die and darken With the firmament to hearken. Soft in silence sinks our sorrow; Resurrection comes to-morrow. Life ye tear to shred and flitter, Joying in the costly glitter To rehearse each art-abortion That consumes a widow's portion. Lavish feast makes secret sorrow; Pinch at heart brings Death to-morrow! Take me where sweet doctrine, hoarded, Stays the ravage, ill-afforded; Wisdom's store, divinely pleasured, Hero heart-beat, poet-measured. Song that lightens out of sorrow Shields from every Death to-morrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LYRICS OF THE STREET. THE FINE LADY. Her heart is set on folly, An amber gathering straws: She courts each poor occurrence, Heeds not the heavenly laws. Pity her! She has a little beauty, And she flaunts it in the day, While the selfish wrinkles, spreading, Steal all its charm away. Pity her! She has a little money, And she flings it everywhere: 'Tis a gewgaw on her bosom, A tinsel in her hair. Pity her! She has a little feeling, She spreads a foolish net That snares her own weak footsteps, Not his for whom 'tis set. Pity her! Ye harmless household drudges, Your draggled daily wear And horny palms of labor A softer heart may bear. Pity her! Ye steadfast ones, whose burthens Weigh valorous shoulders down, With hands that cannot idle, And brows that will not frown, Pity her! Ye saints, whose thoughts are folded As graciously to rest As a dove's stainless pinions Upon her guileless breast, Pity her! But most, ye helpful angels That send distress and work, Hot task and sweating forehead, To heal man's idle irk, Pity her! THE DARKENED HOUSE. One year ago this dreary night, This house, that in my way Checks the swift pulses of delight, Was cordial glad, and gay. The household angels tended there Their ivy-cinctured bower, And by the hardier plant grew fair A lovely lily-flower. The skies rained sunshine on its head, It throve in summer air: âHow straight and sound!â the father said; The mother said, âHow fair!â One little year is gathering up Its glories to depart; The skies have left one marble drop Within the lily's heart. For growth and bloom no more avails The Seasons' changing breath: Fixed in sad constancy, it feels The sculpture-touch of Death. But from its breast let golden rays, Immortal, break and rise, Linking the sorrow-clouded days With dawning paradise. THE OLD MAN'S WALK. Into the sadness of the winter night I bear my heart: Shunning the crowded streets, the glaring light, I walk apart. With trembling feet and head astound I go, With cheeks chill-wet: I must return unto that house of woe; I cannot yet. Unhappy words compel me from the hearth Of love bereft; Should send me reckless o'er the rolling earth, With bosom cleft. O Stranger! ask not why I stray abroad Thus out of time. Mine eye has not the furtive glance of fraud, The leer of crime. Deep Night, within thy gloomy catafalque Bury my grief; And, while thy candles light my funeral walk, Promise relief. Let lightsome spirits that outwatch thy reign, Dawn's sentinels, Shed golden balsam for the sons of pain In prison cells. âAve,â I hear the pitying angels say; From depths they call; âThrough all Grief's multitude Heaven makes a way.â Heaven rest us all! AT A CORNER. Here should I meet you, here only, recalling The soul-drunken look you vouchsafed me one day, That, like a spark in some hidden mine falling, Shook my frail senses, and swept me away. What did that look portend? dark was its meaning, Faded in tears the swift gleam of delight; Ask the deep thoughts of eternity's screening, Ask the wide stars in the bosom of night. Like some winged Seraphim, never descending, That for a moment unveils to our view: Sudden its ravishment, bitter its ending; Love flashed a promise that Life never knew. THE BLACK COACH. In the black coach you must ride,â You, so dainty once a time. We who saw your bloom of pride, Stifle now the crop of crime, Lest its poisonous, fruitful birth Scatter monsters o'er the earth. She had holidays as gay As the highest you have known, Lady, flitting fast away, With your chariot for a throne. Wild-flowers for a moment please In the hands of pampered ease. Lifted, like a summer treasure In a golden goblet placed, To decline in mournful leisure, Scorned, untended, and disgraced; With the meadow yet in sight Where the daisies glisten white. Come, a carriage blacker still, Narrowed to the form you bear; Bring the last of good and ill; Take the leavings of despair. Death's cold purity condense Vaporous sin to soul's intense. Ere the prison-gates unswing, Let the spirit portals ope; While the Winter holds the Spring Shall the grave-mound cover hope; Come the pang that ends all woe, God can better pardon so. PLAY. From yon den of double-dealing With its Devil's host, Come I, maddened out of healing. All is lost. So the false wine cannot blind me, Nor the braggart toast, But I know that Hell doth bind me; All is lost. Where the lavish gain attracts us, And the easy cost, While the damning dicer backs us, All is lost. Blest the rustic in his furrows, Toil and sweat-embossed; Blest are honest souls in sorrows: All is lost. Wifely love, the closer clinging When men need thee most, Shall I come, dishonor bringing? All is lost. Babe in silken cradle lying, To low music tossed, Will they wake thee for my dying? All is lost. Yonder, where the river grimly Whitens like a ghost, Must I plunge and perish dimly: All is lost. THE LOST JEWEL. Cast on the turbid current of the street, My pearl doth swim; Oh for the diver's cunning hands and feet To come to him! No: I'll not seek the madness of thine eyes, Since, day by day, Life brings its noiseless blessings from the skies; For which we pray. While patient Duty, helped of heavenly Art, Her way pursues, And holy loves re-edify the heart The passions use. God's hand can bring unheard-of gifts to light From Fate's deep sea; Has pearls enough to recompense the right, Only not thee. OUTSIDE THE PARTY. Thick throng the snow-flakes, the evening is dreary, Glad rings the music in yonder gay hall; On her who listens here, friendless and weary, Heavier chill than the winter's doth fall. At yon clear window, light-opened before me, Glances the face I have worshipped so well: There's the fine gentleman, grand in his glory; There, the fair smile by whose sweetness I fell. This is akin to him, shunned and forsaken, That at my bosom sobs low, without bread; Had not such pleading my marble heart shaken, I had been quiet, long since, with the dead. Oh! could I enter there, ghastly and squalid, Stand in men's eyes with my spirit o'erborne, Show them where roses bloomed, crushed now and pallid, What he found innocent, leaving forlorn,â How the fair ladies would fail from their dances, Trembling, aghast at my horrible tale! How would he shrink from my words and my glances! How would they shrink from him, swooning and pale! This is the hair that was soft to enchain him; Snakelike, it snarls on my beautiless brow: These are the hands that were fond to detain him With a sense-magic then, powerless now! No: could I come, like a ghost, to affright him, How should that heal my wound, silence my pain? Had I the wrath of God's lightning to smite him, That could not bring me my lost peace again. Ne'er let him grieve while good fortunes betide him, Ne'er count again the poor game lost of old; When he comes forth, with his young bride beside him, Here shall they find us both, dead in the cold. THE SOUL-HUNTER. Who hunts so late 'neath evening skies, A smouldering love-brand in his eyes? His locks outshame the black of night, Its stars are duller than his sight Who hunts so late, so dark. A drooping mantle shrouds his form, To shield him from the winter's storm? Or is there something at his side, That, with himself, he strives to hide, Who hunts so late, so dark? He hath such promise, silver sweet, Such silken hands, such fiery feet, That, where his look has charmed the prey, His swift-winged passion forces way, Who hunts so late, so dark. Sure no one underneath the moon Can whisper to so soft a tune: The hours would flit from dusk to dawn Lighter than dews upon the lawn With him, so late, so dark. But, should there break a day of need, Those hands will try no valorous deed: No help is in that sable crest, Nor manhood in that hollow breast That sighed so late, so dark. O maiden! of the salt waves make Thy sinless shroud, for God's dear sake; Or to the flame commit thy bloom; Or lock thee, living, in the tomb So desolate and dark,â Before thou list one stolen word Of him who lures thee like a bird. He wanders with the Devil's bait, For human souls he lies in wait, Who hunts so late, so dark. STREET YARN. Roses caged in windows, heighten Your faint blooms to-day; Silks and sheeny satins, brighten; He has passed this way! Could ye keep his fleeting presence Gone beyond recall, But a little of his essence, I would have you all. Arabesque so quaint and shady, That mightst catch his eye To adorn a stately lady Ere her hour went by, Canst assure me that his glancing Rested on thy fold? Did that set your purples dancing? Wake the sleepy gold? Ye neglected apple-venders Mouldering in the street, Did he curse between your tenders, Spurning with his feet? Then must I an alms deliver For his graceless pride; Could I buy his sins forever, I'd not be denied. Paying patiently his ransom Never conscience-pricked; Cheating Justice of her handsome Heartless derelict. Did he view thee, ancient steeple, With thy weird clock-face, Frowning down on sinful people Passing out of grace? Nay, respond not to my question With thy prate of time: Things to which my soul must hasten Lie beyond thy chime. With no circumstance to screen us, We must meet again: I shall bid God judge between us, Answering Amen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HER VERSES.âA LYRICAL ROMANCE. THE LEGACY. Her verses,âwhere she lies The tall trees bend and whisper; Soft voices from the skies Recall the tuneful lisper: The sunny nooks she loved, Her flower-beds untended, Afflict us with neglect, Like fair things ill-befriended. Yet 'tis so merciful That Time wipes out our traces, And that the thick-set moss Grows o'er our darkened faces, Till but some faithful heart Our faded traits comprises, And sorrow, dead in earth, In harmless beauty rises. She had a guileless heart, And Life was rude to grieve it; She had a soul of fire, And Heaven is kind to shrive it: The years are past that said, âKeep long this seal unbroken; But, when my name's forgot, Then let my words be spoken.â So, standing at her grave, With trembling hands I gather The blossoms of her life, Bedimmed with rust and weather. O World! while thus I wave Her dead hand's blessing o'er thee, Think 'tis my other self Whose heart lies bare before thee. BLUSHES. I cannot make him know my love; Nor from myself conceal The pangs that rankle in my breast, Sharper than flame or steel. Could I but reach a hand to him, My very finger's thrill Would close, like tendrils, round the strength Of his belovÃ¨d will. Could I but lift mine eyes to his, My glowing soul, unrolled, Would flash like sunset on his sight, In fiery red and gold. Yet pause, my unflecked soul, and think How vexed Penelope Forsook her nuptial joy, that love Should wait on modesty. For gentle souls must keep their bounds, Nor rudely snatch at bliss: The very sun should lose his light In giving it amiss. So, when I die, cross tenderly My palms upon my breast, And let some faithful hand compose My tired limbs to rest. But thou shalt fold this kerchief white, And lay it on my face, Saying, âShe died of love untold; But she is dead in grace.â WISHES. I would I might approach thee, As the moon draws near the cloud, With still and stately courtesy, Clear-eyed and solemn-browed; But, when their meeting comes, her face In his deep breast doth hide, The heavens are still, in solemn joy, The world is glorified. I would I might approach thee, As music, swift afloat, Surprises, with its sudden joy, A wanderer in a boat: The sordid walls of life fall down Before that clarion clear; A passing rapture oft recalled When days grow blank and drear. I would I might approach thee, As breezes fresh and pure, Unsighted, breathe on fevered lips, And throbbing temples cure; As Joy and Love, and healthful Hope, Visit some chosen heart, And enter, softly welcomed there, And never more depart. FEARS. Oh! how shall I grow fair enough For thee to look upon? I am but the poor shallow water That glistens in the sun, That darkens, mean and beautiless, When his brief glance moves on. Oh! what shall raise me to thy sphere? How shall my thoughts aspire? I am the string that warbles to A poet's touch of fire: He flings it by,âhow dumb and low Sinks the forgotten lyre! Remember, then, my humble heart That trembled with surprise; Recall the faith that dared to meet The question of thine eyes: Shall these not make me dear to thee Through Love's eternities? RESOLVES. You never knew how cruel kind Was the caress you gave; You never meant to light a flame Should smoulder in my grave. From gentle studies, arts beloved, My thoughts all fix on thee; And Peace dissolves before my sight, And Duty cannot be. Oh! speak one word so kindly rude, So greatly stern and true, That I may kiss thy feet for shame, And rise, absolved and new. Then with some song of noblest worth I'll pay this truant rhyme, And stretch my stolen broidery to The boundless tasks of Time. STUDIES. Slowly roll the wheels of Science On the flowery ways of Love: Clogged with sweets, the cheated pedant Waits, forgetful of remove. Or like Icarus aspiring To the nearness of the sun; See, the waxen wings are melted, The ambitious race is run! Love has neither past nor future Till thou break its awful vow; Neither was nor shall be blessÃ¨d: It is one eternal Now. LATIN. Here amid shadows, lovingly embracing, Dropt from above by apple-trees unfruitful, With a chance scholar, caught and held to help me, Read I in Horace; Lost in the figures, lawless in the metrum, Piecing the classic phrase with homespun English, Bridging doubtful meanings with such daring fictions As move his wonder. Dust lay condensed on the covers lexiconic,â Tacitus above stairs, quasi sub-neglected, Very little progress since I saw your godship, Day to be remembered! AvÃ¨, sweet Horace, all thy wonder graces (Soul of perfection, with a change of rainbows) Less must delight me than thy fervent nature, Foremost in friendship. âWe with one bound will pursue the silent journey: Ibimus, ibimus,âlet one urn contain us!â Which would survive, to choke Love's glowing embers With Life's gray ashes? Happy thy MÃ¦cenas! happier thou to praise him, Twining thy best beauties round the brow thou lovest: Oh! to nobly name whom the deep heart doth worship Is a boon most holy. Yonder by the high-road, from the post-town leading, Cometh at seasons a worn and dusty carriage: Two white bony horses, rudely loricated, Drag it behind them. In the carriage mostly come my born relations, Very keen to see me in the rural season; Board and bedding gratis, compliments at parting: âCome again next summer.â Oh! if one I knew of hastened down the high-road, Like a heaven-sent angel, present to petition, Would I sit searching thy disjointed meanings, Horace the Dainty? Should I not then fling far the well-bound volume, Decent in sheep-skins thou wert never blest with? For this heart of mine, high leaping, wild rejoicing, Then would be the poet. A DREAM. A woman came, wearing a veil; Her features were burning and pale; At the door of the shrine doth she kneel, And waileth out, bowing her head, âYe men of remembrance and dread, Exorcise the pangs that I feel. A boat that is torn with the tide, A mountain with flame in its side That rends its devouring way, A feather the whirlwind lifts high, Are not wilder or weaker than I, Since Love makes my bosom his prey. Ye Saints, I fall down at your feet; Thou Virgin, so piteous to greet, Reach hither the calm of your hands; Ye statues of power and of art, Let your marble weight lie on my heart, Hold my madness with merciful bands.â The priest takes his candle and book With the pity of scorn in his look, And chants the dull Mass through his teeth; But the penitent, clasping his knees, Cries, âVain as the sough of the breeze Are thy words to the anguish of death.â The priest, with reproval and frown, Bids the listless attendant reach down The water that sprinkles from sin. âYour water is water,â she cries: âThe further its foolishness flies, The fiercer the flames burn within.â âGet thee hence to the cell and the scourge!â The priest in his anger doth urge, âOr the fire of the stake thou shalt prove, Maintaining with blasphemous tongue That the mass-book and censer, high swung, Cannot cast out the demon of Love.â Then the Highest stept down from his place, While the depths of his wonderful face The thrill of compassion did move: âCome, hide thee,â he cried, âin this breast; I summon the weary to rest; With love I exorcise thy love.â WAKING. Soft as the touch of twilight that restores The hard-bound earth from summer sweat and strain, This dream of morning soothed my fevered soul, And gave me to my gentleness again. So, bathed in pearly sweets, I oped mine eyes, And saw the beauty that the morning paints, And saw the shadows strengthen in the sun With the calm willingness of dying saints. Oh! had I then to passion died, such peace Had filled my parting as transfigures Death; But thou didst turn me backward with a word, And Love celestial fled Love's human breath. THE SUMMONS. I expect you in September With the glory of the year: You shall make the Autumn precious, And the death of Summer dear; You shall help the days that shorten, With a lengthening of delight; You shall whisper long-drawn blisses Through the gathering screen of night. I will lead you, dream-enchanted, Where the fairest grasses grow; I will hear your murmured music Where the fresh winds pipe and blow. On the brown heath, weird-encircled, Shall our noiseless footsteps fall,â We, communing with twin counsel, Each to other all in all. Leave the titles that men owe thee; Like the first pair let us meet; Name the world all over to me, New-created at thy feet; Gentle task and duteous learning, I will hang upon thy breath With the tender zeal of childhood, With the constancy of death. What shall be the gods declare not,â They who stamp Love's burning coin Into spangles of a moment, Into stars that deathless shine. Oh! the foolish music lingers; For the theme is heavenly dear: I expect you in September, With the glories of the year. WAITING. I have set my house in order For a stately step to grace; I have bidden the mirrors keep record Of a never-forgotten face; I have brightened with thrifty cunning The walls of my sylvan home: They are beautiful in the shadow Of him who vouchsafes to come. I have swept the leaves from the greensward, And the gray stones twinkle and shine; I have loosened each fretful tangle Of the twisted cedar and vine; I have ordered the waters waste not Their splendors upon mine eye, But to wait, like my heart, for thy footsteps, And gush when thou drawest nigh. Myself I would dress for thy presence; But there I must stand and weep, Since the years that teach Love's value His vanishing treasure sweep. But words that are spells of magic, And merciful looks and ways, Shall brighten the rusted features That faded when none did praise. Thou gracious and lordly creature, Do the trees, when thou passest by, Let down their fair arms to enlace thee, And the flowers reach up to thine eye? Do they wait, all athrill, when thou passest, For a touch of thy life divine? Do they fold their meek hands when thou fleetest, And die for a breath of thine? My heart has leapt forth to embrace thee; It clings, like a babe, to thy breast; And my blood is a storm-stirred ocean That waits for the word of rest. Time loses his paltry measure Now that Love's eterne draws near, And the lingering moments that part us Are endless in hope and fear. Oh! what if, beyond thy sunshine, Some gathering storm should brood? Thy rapture, forsaking, shall leave me Alone with God's orphanhood. The heart thou hast blest so inly Shall wait no inglorious breath: Come hither, then, ye who walk twinly; So enter here, Love and Death! THE END. Death entered where Love was waiting With the frosted lily-crown,â Pale pontiff, shadow-mating, Waving the life-flame down. His slaves, with robes of whiteness, Shrouded the glowing face: Gone is the vision of brightness, A ghost is in its place. They bore her with solemn knelling, By saintly crypt and nave, To her new-appointed dwelling,â The cloisters of the grave. There, 'mong the silent sisters, She tarries, with folded palms: Where the passing torch-light glisters, They answer in whispered psalms. But as one the convent hideth, At the festivals of God, From the covert where she bideth, Sends holy song abroad; So she, whom then we buried With manifold sob and strain, Sends back her song, love-varied, To waken our joy again,â Sends back the flame of fervor That warms not her frozen breast, To guide Love's true deserver To her place in the fields of rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS OF STUDY AND EXPERIENCE. KOSMOS. Of dust the primal Adam came In wondrous sequency evolved, With speech that gave creation name, Of art and artist never solved. With something of a mother-pang The Sun conceived the starry spheres That from her burning bosom sprang,â Immortal children of her tears. From height of heat, and stress of span, The measured Earth took poise and hold; And beasts, the prophecy of man, And man, were latent in her mould. And hid in man a world intense, The centre point of things that be, With soul that conquers out of sense Its incomplete divinity. Around one infinite intent All power and inspiration move, Thrilling with light the firmament, Lifting the heart of man with love. FIRST CAUSES. âWe need no God,â the Atheist said; âThe World is wound, and set to go: How it was wound we do now know; But go it will when we are dead. You question me as one who pleads To keep his ancient faith with tears: In this our harmlessness appears,â We rob no nature of its needs. The weak, for whom a God must be, Will hold the apt invention still, While from the arbitrary will We and the hardier souls are free.â Like one who in the dark would walk Where men by day securely tread, And stumbles with uneasy dread, The Atheist blundered in his talk. Now from my window I survey This amphitheatre of peace, Where moon and stars, without surcease, Nightly present their heavenly play. I see the beauteous drama wrought; Its acts and interludes I trace: I need not seek the Author's face, Whose spirit visits me unsought. And what that need, both old and new, The eternal need of human-kind? Not that we keep a fable blind: It is that thou, dear God, be true. KENYON'S LEGACY. Good Johnny Kenyon's gone and done The best thing with his money: He's left it for two Poet-Bees, Who make the wasp-world honey. Unthrifty work,âa world has wants, A market-man provides it; Small wages has the working bee, Or the good God who guides it. But Kenyon knew the market-men, And so bestowed his money, That our two rifled Bees might live From henceforth on their honey. In Casa Guidi, where they dwell, They keep the tea-pot waiting: The precious vapor spends itself For their poetic prating. I know a Western dame who keeps The villa styled Negroni, And whose well-regulated cups Are hot to friend and crony. She says our poets enter like A church who brings his steeple; With visions of the gods they praise, They yawn at common people. When they in turn invite at home, The chairs are queer and rotten, The board is bare, the talk divine, The tea-pot long forgotten. John Kenyon was an Englishman, And understood the duty England expects from English wives, Who stand for thrift and beauty. He did not score it in his will, For that had been ungracious; He told it not by word of mouth,â Dependence thrice fallacious. â'Tis in the fitness of the thing, And they, be sure, will feel it; Or else some medial-rapping friend For sixpence may reveal it. Aurora! dry your pen at night; Repose shall help your dreaming; Enjoy your victuals from this hour, And keep your tea-pot steaming.â Like those long-exiled Empire-bees, Who now, to fortune coming, Poise on the topmost bough, and fill Your Europe with their humming; So may you, gold-emblazoned, rest On velvet pall and mantle, Or where luxurious drapings hide Time's monitors ungentle. Or better, build a crystal hive, With this remembrance sunny: âOne good man helps the bankrupt world To pay our priceless honey.â TO ONE WHO LIES IN FLORENCE. Shower lilies from the skies Where our lovely Ladye lies! Birds of more than mortal tune, Soothe her rest by night and noon; Angel loves be softly told O'er her consecrated mould; Hearts that noblest strive and mean At her shrine their comforts glean. Neither may the sun despise To salute her where she lies, Nodding over woods and water To Apollo's crownÃ¨d daughter, Christian Sappho she, whose verse Holy loving souls rehearse That a benediction seek Pontiffs have not grace to speak; For her bosom temple sweet Charity did make complete; Human passions lost their pride Ranged before the gentle-eyed; Sword of meekness pierceth deep, Bitterest chide the eyes that weep; And her anger humbled most Through her pity, never lost. Sister, whose fair lot is cast Where the shadows of the past And the sunshine of to-day Interlace on God's highway, None of all thy joys I'd ask, Harnessed gladly to my task, But the parting kiss she gave, And the pause beside her grave. Scatter lilies from the skies, Shower tears from angels' eyes, Who forget not that their joy Our contentment doth destroy. Nought of earth so good and fair That beside her may compare; Nought of heaven too purely blest To infold her sinless rest! A VICTIM OF TIBERIUS. What wouldst thou with me, jailer dark and grim? My father was Sejanus: this his house, From which they took him darkly, days ago, Is mine own home, where I have right to dwell. Where went my father? He was CÃ¦sar s friend. But, waiting here, I heard the multitude Shouting his death, which yet I'll not believe. And, when they forced my brother from my side, Still as a ghost he went, and came no more. See my poor toys spread out before the hearth! It was a mimic sacrifice I made: This doll was Iphigenia, this the priest; And here I pierced my finger, to make blood, Till my nurse chid me. Are you come for that? I know our pastime may offend the gods; Know the dark air is full of whispering things That bear our follies to the ear of those Whose wrath is strong, and vengeance terrible. But I'm not wicked: 'twas no deadly rite Invoking evil chance on man or God, Or CÃ¦sar, who is both, they say, in one. If any power have sent you for my faults, Which I'll confess as quickly as you'll name, Bid old Camilla take my mother's rod, (I had a mother,) she can use it well; And I'll endure it, though I meant no wrong. Thou dost not leave me? In thy fearful eyes, My childhood withers with an instant age. The marrow of my joints seems long drawn out Caught on the horror of thy countenance. Oh! this is like the nightmare that I feared, Not knowing it could walk abroad by day. I'd shriek for pity; but my voice is choked, As if the ashes of the things I love Stood in my throat to bury utterance. I must go with thee? Never, while I live. Ah, pity! by my hair he hurries me Forth from the palace, through the glaring streets, That strangely reel, and vanish from my sight. I see the gods there, black against the sky, And stiffening with the horror of men's deeds. The spell that binds my lips is on their hands, Or they would move to help me. Where is CÃ¦sar? Now hear this wretch that whispers in mine ear, âCÃ¦sar will have thy blood.â This gives me strength To snap the chilly net-work of my fear, And cry, âThou liest!â See, the Consul comes! âO noble man! I clasp thy garment's edge: Save me as thou wouldst save thy fair-haired girl, My playmate once.â Tears darkle in his eyes: Pale, with a stifled curse he turns away; He cannot aid me. Where the columns range, The conscript fathers keep the weal of Rome. Hark to me, fathers,âI am fatherless! So quick away? Hear, Tyber, then, my cry; Hear, ye protecting hills! Ah! silent all. What's this dark vault? and what yon rusted ring With the noose dangling? Look to thine own fate! Thou dar'st not slay a virgin. I will tear Thine eyes with these small fingers ere thou come A foot's length nearer! Keep away, away, Thou untold horror! Only touch me not; And I will twine thy halter round my throat Like a bright riband on a festal day. Give me the rope! let my poor bruised hands go, Seeking the priceless mercy Death can bring. Oh, come! since thy still feet are waited for As the last rapture,âsweet, thou com'st too late. CAIUS CÃSAR. I am the monster Caius, loathed of men,â Him whose foul record women may not read. In distant Gaul, an altar to the gods Attests the mother-pangs that brought me forth, As I should prove a boon to move them thanks. My father bred me soldierly in camps; And the small jack-boots gave my childish name Caligula. That father, in the East, Sickened with secret poisons. Ye remember How wild his widow bore the funeral urn, Landing at Cyprus? Dark Tiberius then Drew his death-circle slowly round our way. My mother, struggling longest, fell at last. Two brothers followed,âone by hunger's woe; One by his own resolvÃ¨d hand escaped The hangman's noose, and hooks of infamy. But I, surviving, kept the tyrant's side So near, he could not spring to strangle me. Slowly he recognized my crafty soul, Knew me his master in all shameful arts, And, having lopped the fair limbs from the tree, Left me for the blood-blossoms I should bear, And fruit of death. At first I only aped His outward fashions; then I learned his thoughts; Then his malignant madness seized on me, And made me like him. Dying as he lay, I forced the cushion 'twixt his gaping jaws, And sped his flight from earth. That was, at least, A service. Could I catalogue my deeds, Thou couldst not stay to hear them. Hell itself Swoons at the fatal tale, and cries, âAway!â My royal ways were tapestried with blood; First my young brother's, followed by a train Of ghosts that might become imperial race. I snatched from new-wed souls their nuptial joys, And flung them back, disfigured to disgust. So monstrous and unnatural my lusts, That the dark horror of the CÃ¦sar's name Banished the blushing rose of modesty, And set a ghastly pallor in its place. My victims were not rashly sped to death, But tickled with such agony of pain As gave the stab of dissolution price. These pleasures wearied, when the thirst for gold Set in, as cruel and more terrible. I wrung the hand of toil, whose wretched pence Gained too much honor in my haughty use. I saw that vice had profit; wherefore then I planted it, and gave it ministrance, As one should tend a vine of fiery growth, To madden others, and enrich one's self. To coin, coin, coin, from every bosom's life, Became my master-thought. Nor was there rest When darkness hid the busy threads that weave The color and consistence of men's days. My dreams were brief. I walked the silent halls, And plotted murder till the morning came That made it easy. When I clasped a neck Close to mine own, I whispered, âLove me well, Since this fair throat is mine to cut or keep.â All attributions to myself I drew, All powers, all pleasures, all magnificence. I clothed in silks and plumes and gems confused. Now as a woman, now as man, I walked, Now as a god, with beard of wroughten gold; And no one chid me,âno one showed a chain, Or frowned, or threatened as I passed his way. Beauty was peril,âthe fair locks of youth Were shorn to honor my denuded front. Where one stood eminent for strength and grace, I marked him, and the hangman had his word. Thus did my rivals vanish. All the while, The slow death ripened in yon treacherous skies, That looked so blandly, till one burning noon, All Rome being gathered at the circus sport, Loosed the swift hand that smote me. As it fell, A score of poniards, like a shower of stars, Glittered before me: death was everywhere; And, hacked and hewed like Julius, I went down. One shout, the uplifting of a sea of hearts That praised the gods, was my last sign on earth. The night before the end of all things came, I dreamed I sat beside Olympian Jove, And, reasoning as an equal, blazoned forth Designs and deeds. âThus have I done, and thus; From mine own will, the perfect law of earth. Hast thou no joy in my magnificence That goes abroad so glorious, like to thine? Look at my costly tunic, broidered robe, Beard of pure gold, and blazing diadem! Think of my pleasures, boundless as thine own; My power, like thine, unquestioned, flinging down Death, and a thousand deaths, for one caprice. I claim celestial triumph at thine hands: Here shall they crown me, equal to thyself.â And in my heart I pondered, âWhy not greater?â Thereat the Immortal's front grew dark with wrath, And, with one sudden spurning of his foot, He sent me down to earth, precipitate. Even on this wise, the morrow showed my fall; But I am now where lower depth is none, Nor light of Jove, nor human countenance. Only a company of crownÃ¨d ghosts Fill up the void with wail that never tires, Who, with a drunken madness like to mine, Dreamed they were gods, and, waking, were not men. CLAUDIUS. When Caius CÃ¦sar sank 'neath righteous steel, The sweet blue patience of the firmament Giving full measure, ere Jove's lightning fell,â Poor Uncle Claudius! the fool, of whom Augustus wrote, âLet him not sit with us To see the games; contrive him out of sight Who shames the CÃ¦sars with his awkward ways,ââ He, scorned of men, the butt of all his tribe, Astonished with the murder, hid his head In the first truckle-bed he came upon, Leaving his heels out, by the which they seized, And dragged him forth. âTo death?â he shivering cried. âTo empire!â they, and crowned him where he stood. Not in derision, he gave grace to God, And spread his solid base of human life. The ambitious rather tampered with his wives Than set him on to capering cruelty. Law did he give, assiduous, all the day; Though, once, the cook-shop near the judgment-hall So overcame him, that he slid away, Feasted him full, and let the sentence wait. His tastes in blood were moderate, but nice. He loved to see the Retiarius die, And therefore bade him lift his quivering face In the last spasm. Or he would wait a day The leisure of the executioner Rather than lose the victim's agonies The law allowed him. With a sudden zeal He pleaded once the tavern-keeper's cause: âFor who, my masters, would forego his morsel At the right moment, smoking, brown, and crisp? And those old wine-shops, with such cool retreats, And clammy jars, distilling juice divine, Shall we not keep them? Other things must pass: These good old friends shall stand, Joy's monuments.â He gave the people victuals more than once, And worthy games, with water combats rare. Walking abroad, he dubbed them âDominos,â His toga loose and slovenly put on, And offered salutation with his left,â An act unseemly for a nobleman. His married life had little luck or skill,â The second venture wilder than the first, While the third slew him with his favorite dish, The stew of mushrooms, dangerous and dear. Pass on, poor wretch, so dull and debonair,â This mayst thou teach: How great soe'er the fool, The multitude's a greater whom he rides. THE VISION OF PAUL. What is this that stops my way Like a wall, unseen by day? Who doth bid my errand stay Ere I come? What o'erclouds me like a dream, Blotting each remembered scheme With an unaccustomed theme? âJÃ¨su sum.â What strange dissolution rends From the comfort of my friends, From my life's determined ends? Dark and dumb, What doth bind my fluent tongue Like an instrument unstrung, With its lesson never sung? âJÃ¨su sum.â See! this sudden shock of light Falls like palsy on my sight, Till I view no path aright In my gloom; All my faculties are dead, Every sinew bound with lead: What this shivering trance of dread? âJÃ¨su sum.â âListen, since for human weal, That thy misdirected zeal, Mightier than it murdered, heal, Am I come: Thou with stones my saints hast slain, Torture bound with scourge and chain; Know thyself the martyr pain! JÃ¨su sum. Thou wert mine without thy knowing; From this moment's wonder-showing, Pay the debt thy life is owing Burthensome: On the blindness of thy thought Dawns the inner life unsought. Teach, as thou thyself art taught; JÃ¨su sum.â 1830 AND 1853. An old man mazed and wild Bearing a blond-haired child, A woman blind with tears,â The mournful train sweeps on; And the monarchy is gone For all the coming years. They would have lingered slow, For their hearts beat faint and low, Their lives were a feeble spoil; But the power that's new and strong Cries, âHasten them along, Away from their native soil!â But I can stop, and sigh At this grief of years gone by,â An old man's fault and fall,â And say that the exile's woe Is a piteous thing to know, Is the heaviest weird of all. In a palace bare and old That a royal race left cold, These children of the sun Shall moulder in faded state, Till the sentence, soon or late, Remove them every one. Perhaps the shade of her, For whom brave blood doth stir To this day in gallant breasts, Moved through the dusky pile, And welcomed with sad smile The old ancestral crests. The France that gave her birth, Land of delight and mirth Her lips were fond to bless, Rolled this one shattered wave Across her foreign grave For very tenderness. She stands beside his knee, And, looking wistfully Upon his reverend head, Sighs, âUncle, are you come From our belovÃ¨d home? 'Tis better to be dead!â O England! glad and free, With thine own liberty Endow thy trembling guest; Stretch soft thy mantle where He feels the wintry air, And fondle him to rest. But, lo! a wilder sob, A swift and mighty throb; And towards the rugged North, With exiled steps of pain, And fevered eye and brain, Tis France herself goes forth. 'Tis France; for 'neath the sun Freedom and she were one Five little years ago. Her glorious flag they fold As a thing disused and old: âWe have other fashions now.â Her sons must seek their bread, And lay the weary head In countries cold and lone; Their halls are desolate; The friends that made them great, Their works, and days, are gone. Nay, never flee, but stand, Your good sword in your hand, And cry your watchword true. Drive the pursuer back: The foe upon your track Is mortal, even as you. His slimy, serpent ways; His cold, voluptuous days; His coffers, guilt-increased; Your fathers' hearths grow cold, Yourselves in exile old, That he may reign and feast. His infant let him fold In cloth of silk and gold, Feeding on pearly food: That child of bastard race, Let it, too, find a place In quiet Holy rood. Flame lights the sunken cheek; But the exile's hand is weak, Weightless for good or ill: Heaven give him sufferance! But thou, great land of France, But God, what is thy will? Oh! never read to-day, Oh! stretching far away Where stars revolve and burn,â The lessons of the free, The good that is to be, My children wait to learn. PERUGIA. Remember ye Perugia, where Raphael dwelt in years Whose visions crowded on his brain, ere praise amazed his ears; Where, ripening fast, a Virgin in his master's style he drew, With Babe and Prayer-book in her hands, and heavy hood of blue? Oh! saw you e'er the Switzers stand in helmed and jerkined row, When Christ's meek vicar up the aisle of holy church would go? Bull-necked and brutal-featured they, ferocious, bold and strong,â Their only faith the pound of flesh that's paid for, right or wrong. I've seen them when that church was thronged with pageants grand and gay; When royal rank, and worldly fame, and beauty there held sway: The columns wavered in the smoke, the banners hung aloof, And the golden song effaced from mind the glories of the roof. My soul was drunk with harmony, my senses swam and reeled: It may be, when the trump did sound, that down I sank and kneeled; Yet thought I, when I marked those men in cuirass and in sword, âHow little is the Vicar's state remindful of his Lord! No need to keep the people from his mild and harmless way; They touched his garments for relief, and were not warned away; And, when his hour of danger came, he put defence to shame, Commanding, âSheathe again thy sword, or perish by the same!ââ They came to old Perugia, that helmed and jerkined pack; They came with murder in their hearts, and armor at their back; They shot the men about the streets, the women at their fire, The infant at its mother's knee, child, wife, and aged sire. The streets ran blood in every house some ghastly corpse was seen. The passing traveller saved his life by a forgotten screen; And, when the fiends have done their work, to Rome they take their way; The Pope doth welcome them again, and gladly counts their pay. Remember well Perugia, thou Old World and thou New! The Vicar's visitation this,âsuch care he takes of you, Ye of no sin accused or tried, warped to no heresy, Guilty of nothing but the sweet contagion of the free. Remember, ye who deeply think, and ye who greatly dare; Remember, ye who talk with God in poesy and prayer; For he's the lie of all the earth, that false Pope, pride-enthroned, Begirt with flaming cardinals, an idol, serpent-zoned. 'Tis time that Christ should come again, and sweep his temple clean, And rend the glittering robes that hide a fable poor and mean. His Church was not a fortress armed, to deal out death and dread; Nor yet a mummy sepulchre, where men adore the dead: It wasâbut ere our creeds grow wise, let once our arms be strong To fling beyond the hating world this monstrous curse and wrong. Sweet Christ, let faithless Peter sink, forgotten, like a stone; And the fair ship move swiftly on, afloat with thee alone! My country, let no hoary lie for refuge come to you! The things that were have had their day; the things that are, are true. While women kiss the jewelled hand, and praise the broidered hem, Let men bring back the heart of Christ, that lives for us and them. OF WOMAN. It was a silken woman of the world That of fond Herod claimed the Baptist's head: âIf this sad virtue gets to countenance, Our dancing's done with, in the quickest way.â And, for a painted toy, the anointed brow That knew the Christ's significance must fall. Such deadly power is hid in smallest things: The Aspic might have chilled from Love's delight The bosom it assisted to Love's end. The shaft of death is subtle as a thread,â The air may bring, the garland's bloom conceal,â One desperate finger holds it over us, Or in a woman's snowy breast it lies. Teach, then, the woman all the Prophet's worth, So will she bow the tresses of her head To yield him passing homage, and pour out The treasure of her life to ransom his. I love the woman with the woman's heart, Giving, not gathering,âshedding light abroad As the man glooms it in, for midnight toil. Better our Hebrew Eve, who shares with love The guilty glory of her stolen prize, Than the three haughty Heathen who rose up, Claiming of man a vain pre-eminence,â Not his to give,âGod's only, and the heart's. They showed me drawings by a six-years' child Of beasts incongruous, harnessed to a car: âNow, on my life, he is artist-born,â I said. âWherefore? You see the slim camelopard Rearing her strength up, pulling from the head; While the swift horses stretch to twice their length, Spinning themselves to slender threads of speed, Nay, with their iron sinews knitting up A belt of haste like that our Shakspeare drew With Puck's impatient malice, round the world. The little one has guessed the trick of strength And action, so is artist-born,â I say. âFor your true artist knows how all things work; Bestows no Zephyrus to prop a pile Whose angles huge insult his littleness, Cramping the sympathetic soul with pain, But the great patient forms whose shoulders broad Invite such burthens; whose fixed features say, âThis weight contents us; we are glad in strength;â While the light figure poises at the top, Holding the heavy network gathered up To meet the apex of his graciousness. So, Sisters, leave the weightier tasks of strength, The underpinnings of society, And flutter with your graces nearer heaven. He thinks of you, the steadfast Caryatid,â The faithful arches clasp their hands beneath To keep you in your breathless eminence; The gloomy cellar way, the weary stair, Exalt the platform where you reign serene. Stay there, Beloved, the Angel at the top, That crowns and lightens all the heavy work. The very prisoners, entering at the grate, Perceive an intercession in thine eyes, And keep their dungeons, waiting for thy sword. Stay thus, my Angel, seeing over thee The Heaven that dreamed the Mary and her Christ,â The dream whereat the Baby Earth awoke, And, smiling, keeps that smile forever more.â LYKE-WAKE. I saw him at a banquet gay, Elate with speech and flushed with wine: Above the revel making way, His eye, unwitting, answered mine. What his expressed I did not read; But mine, if I mistake not, said, âThis minds me of their feasts indeed Who drain the wine-cup o'er their dead; Who set the liquid fire to flare Where late the spirit-flame has flown; The sorrow still unearthed and bare The miserable drink should drown.â BARGAINS. He prest a ruby on her lips, whose burning blood shone through; Twin sapphires bound above her eyes, to match their fiery blue; And, where her hair was parted back, an opal gem he set,â Type of her changing countenance, where all delights were met. âWill you surrender now,â he said, âthe ancient grudge you keep Untiring and unutterÃ¨d, like murder in the deep?â âI thank you for the word,â she said; âyour gems are fair of form But when did jewels bind the depths, or splendors still the storm? There is no diamond in the mine, nor pearl beneath the wave, There is no fretted coronet that soothes a princely grave, There is nor fate nor empire in the wide infinity, Can stand in grace and virtue with the gift you had from me.â ROUGE GAGNE. The wheel is turned, the cards are laid; The circle's drawn, the bets are made: I stake my gold upon the red. The rubies of the bosom mine, The river of life, so swift divine, In red all radiantly shine. Upon the cards, like gouts of blood, Lie dinted hearts, and diamonds good, The red for faith and hardihood. In red the sacred blushes start On errand from a virgin heart, To win its glorious counterpart. The rose that makes the summer fair, The velvet robe that sovereigns wear, The red revealment could not spare. And men who conquer deadly odds By fields of ice, and raging floods, Take the red passion from the gods. Now, Love is red, and Wisdom pale, But human hearts are faint and frail Till Love meets Love, and bids it hail. I see the chasm, yawning dread; I see the flaming arch o'erhead: I stake my life upon the red. MAID AND MISTRESS. AN ECLOGUE. Lady Olympia, I'm so glad you've left The dreary villa for this pleasant home That lies in sight of every omnibus, And sends the winds that whistle as they pass To vent their spite elsewhere,âso stout it is. Here, too, are men to tramp the stairs for us, The sort of men that care for women's thanks. Your country louts, you know, are country-bred: No mother-feeling, stirring at the heart, Sends them to help us at the wood or well. Then, so communicable with the shops! The butcher comes, the baker also comes, And at a nod the grocer's boy is here; While from my cousin's uncle's brother's wife I hear of neighbors, and the folks at home. You sigh, dear lady; for you loved your fields, And talked of Nature, which I never learned, Seeking the sunny corners all day long; Or, sitting grand and graceful in the hall, Kept still a blazing log to comfort you, While we went shivering up the garret stairs, Asking each night, âWhen will my lady move?â Ah! mistress dear, I love your service well, And praise it with the honest bread I eat: But you're too easy with our sort of folk; And that great cook, the red-faced, humbugs you. The man tooâwhy, his eyes will dance with mirth When you receive his solemn tale of work, Looking such pity for his aching joints; He having sat beside the kitchen fire, And munched his victuals thankless, all the day, While we, poor womankind, have hauled the coals, And brought the water up, with straining backs, Till he has grown ashamed to meet our looks, And feigned a villanous sleep to shut them out. Well, well, you're snug within your chamber now, And I have company, and needful help, And beautiful oak-chips to light your fire; And so the winter promises to pass: But, Dame Olympia, let me rule the cook, And keep her cousins from the larder shelf, All fond of her, and blest with appetite. And should that louting Thomas rouse himself. Never say, âThomas, do not work so hard;â For when you speak so, and I bid him wag, He'll answer, âDid you mind my mistress' words? I'm sitting here to help her care of me.â Thus spake my favorite, petted by long love; And I forgave that neighborhood of stars, And softest quarrel 'twixt the shore and sea, Which made my villa, where you've sat at meat With little splendor, worthy of a queen. THE MODERATE MAN. How shall the money flow into my pocket? Swift grow the fortunes of men, and their pride. Small my estate, though I labor to stock it, Left of my father, fourfold to divide. Money to dress these fair girls of mine finely, Catch a rich suitor, and rivet him fast; Couches of silk to repose on supinely, Wooing the life-joys gone by with the past. Soon my young master asks horses to ease him, Saucy at college, at billiards most brave; Endless devices shall plunder and please him, Youth must have follies, and parents can save. Nay, thou art pampered e'en now out of measure, Lackest no comfort through hunger or grief; Dances and festivals bring needless pleasure, Seen to depart with a sigh of relief. See where my lost ones sit low in their mourning, Sunken the bosom, and hollow the cheek; There may thy spirit find better adorning With the inheritance vowed to the meek. Seeking the boasting, the tinsel, the racket, Little thou learn'st Life's miraculous art: Let the gold rather flow out of thy pocket; Then may the mercy flow into thy heart. CONTRASTS. I shall not come to the heavenly court As I enter your ball to-night, In tissues wreathed with flowery sport, And jewels of haughty light, Bearing on shoulders stiff and straight The marble of my face, Moving with high and measured gait To claim my yielded place. Poor narrow souls! your easy spite Moves this enforced disdain: I cannot vanish from the fight Other than crowned or slain. The russet garb of penitence For me were lighter wear Than all a queen's magnificence, A prince's minivÃ¨re. Unloose, unloose your chains of pride, Set my vexed spirit free, That I may follow my angel guide In glad humility. For I would hearken the sentence deep, Abide the lifted rod, And sink, like a chastened child, to weep In the fatherhood of God. JEALOUSY. Low in my bosom, aspic, thou must hide, Its best blood not too dainty for thy fang; Such closeness saves me from the hell of pride, Should haughty conquerors know the deadly pang. No beggar takes thee home. In all men's eyes I have been crowned with glory in my time: Joy that made Envy cruel to a crime Has draped me in the sight of summer skies. And she who flouts me, fallen from my prime, Had been a spot upon my affluent noon That grasped the hill-tops, and the valleys drew To one accord of rapturous delight. Ah me! in love, December waits on June: We have not lost a gesture nor a tune, Before a rival revels in our right. Sting deep to death, that sex and soul be lost, That they, the happy, may turn cold with shame; Love, to recall his gem of worthier cost; And Hate, to find me perished ere she came. WITHOUT AND WITHIN. Go away to the world's wild hubbub: I cannot go with thee; For the deep home-anchors hold me From the waves of that yeasty sea, Where, the sun my fresh sail gilding, We once held company. If the vain and the silly bind thee, I cannot unlock thy chain; If sin and the senses blind thee, Thyself must endure the pain; If the arrows of conscience find thee, Thou must conquer thy peace again. Here the line that runs between us Is narrow, but black as night: Faith sits passive this side the border, More happy, perhaps, than sight; And I wring me slow drops of comfort Where once I drank swift delight. For I sit here with lovelorn Tasso; With Dante, hooded and crowned; While, further, the classic satyrs Beat the old Virgilian ground; And I hark for the Flaccian lyre, Till spirit comes back for sound. Here I sit with the scornful Roman Who tells his grim tale so cold Of the vanishing Southern nation, And the Northerns bright-haired and bold: Last year 'twas a breathless story, But now 'tis a tale oft told. And the sons of Science around me Reach help from reservÃ¨d hands: They have spread their net for the Godhood, And bound Him with close-wove bands, While He counts their small thoughts in His balance With minutes, and drops, and sands. I am here with the prophets whose warnings In the golden eternity fall; I am here with the good Physician Who healeth both great and small; I am here with the great soul-masters; And sorrow, greater than all. THE VOICE OF THE CATARACT. Canopied by trees, the Torrent Rages on her bed of stone; She, so slim and staid last summer, To a monstrous madness grown. At her feet the fair Spray children, Tossing wide their snowy locks, Cushion soft her frantic movements From the roughness of the rocks. What doth ail thee, hoary Princess, Tossing on thy bed of pain, While the ruddy trees above thee Drop unceasing tears of rain? Fain to loose thy pallid tresses, Fain thy garments wild to tear,â Like a passion, ever moving; Like a sorrow, ever there. Was the summer wind thine Essex? Did some treacherous blossom-pile Keep his last sigh from thy bosom, From his sight thy pardoning smile? âOh the bitter frost of winter! Oh the false delight of spring! He whose heart knows no betrayal Skills not of the song I sing.â THE EVENING RIDE. Through purple clouds with golden crests I go to find my lover; Hid from my sight this many a year, My heart must him discover: I know the lair of the timid hare, The nest of the startled plover. O Earth! of all thy garlands keep The fairest for our meeting: Could we ask music, 'twere to drown The heart's tumultuous beating, That only eyes, in glad surprise, Might look through tears their greeting. If Time have writ my beauty out, I have no charm to blind him; No snare to catch his doubting soul, Nor vow exchanged to bind him; But this I keep, that I must weep Bitterly when I find him. NIGHT-MUSINGS. I walk the lonely roofs at night, The roof-tree creaking as I go; A farthing taper gives me light, And monstrous darkness sits below. What spell is in these feet of mine That binds them so to beat the air? What tears are in my blood, or wine, That will not yield to sleep or prayer? Ah me! the day brought sleep enough; Its humming pulses drowsed my soul; My ways were spun of funeral stuff, And every meal was death and dole. But now my measured footstep seems A chariot, drawn by burning doves; Or now my fancy climbs in dreams A ladder of transfigured loves. Or now I stand as Jacob stood, Matched hand to hand, and knee to knee: Thou unknown Fate, declare thy good! Answer, and I will set thee free. And now I walk a garden bed, Whose flowers contend with fervent airs; And each fair bell that lifts its head A look of loved remembrance wears. Or, last, I sit in some strange isle, Unsexed by Age and Wisdom's might, And make a pictured parchment smile With words illegible for light. A slip, a shock, a distant tone! The world's pale watchman crying woe; I spin my thread of light alone, And darkness whets its shears below. SUMMER NIGHT. In the lovely summer night, Softest music breathes around me, Softest memories have bound me, In the lovely summer night. A Star doth send his light,â A blazing diamond, pearl beset, The brightest where the bright are met, In the lovely summer night. In the lovely summer night,â Walking with beloved shadows O'er the star-lit heaths and meadows In the lovely summer night. In the lovely summer night, Sharp-edged Sorrow waits to seize me; Death, from sorrow to release me In the lovely summer night. EROS HAS WARNING. Shut here thy burning gospel; Thou and I must part, O Love! Keep ambush for youth's gay spirits To bear in thy car above; Leave me slow to tread the earth-ball, Who languidly live and move. Wait not with thy wings where I issue In the winter's cold and frost, To carry me swift through the snow-drift, And the heavens, cloud-embossed: I will take me a humbler airing, Will travel at lowlier cost. Thou foe of the task and the fireside, Thou foe of the placid brow, Thou tyrant of gentlest bosoms, Seek other dominion now! For my years lie counted before me; I must work to redeem a vow. When thou passest, all in thy glory, With thy rosy-bosomed crew; When thy PÃ¦an loud resoundeth, And the World is crowned anew,â I'll not join the frantic strophe, I'll not sing âIoâ too. A web of peace and of science Hangs gathering in my loom, And I work after thoughts of wisdom That blot out our human doom; And the garb I have wrapped around meâ I shall carry it to the tomb. So here I acknowledge, master, Thy magical law and spell; Oh! deeper than thought can fathom, Oh! greater than words can tell; Let us part from our hands' long clasping, And solemnly bid farewell. EROS DEPARTS. Love that wert my being, Love that passest death, Am I here without thee, Breathing human breath? Moving, not to meet thee On this summer morn? While the Earth, new-cinctured, Blyth and bloom adorn? While the deep-hung branches, Trailing, sweep the ground, And the droning beetle Spinneth round for round, And the light, wave-broken, Shimmers on the sea, Do I sit here, waiting Nevermore for thee? But for thee my fancy Chose these garments white, Wove the tufted roses But for thy delight; But for thee this diamond, Darling of the mine, Glistens in the ear-drop Like a tear of thine,â Like a tear, that, welling From thy happy breast, Where thy vows were whispered, Waiteth to be blest. Beasts in yonder meadow Lightly choose a mate, Missing, scarce a day's length Wonder they, and wait; But the ewe lamb's mother Bleateth long and sore; Thrush, in yonder covert, Sorroweth evermore; Choking with a spasm In her silver strain, âDear delight of summer, Come again, again!â Not that thou shouldst leave me,â Thou, ethereal born; But that I survive thee,â That is grief and scorn. Poor in form and stature, Pale and dull of hue, By thy creed of beauty Towards thy wish I grew, Fought with Time and Nature, Conquered bitter pain, Keeping thievish footsteps From thy dear domain. From that task delightsome, Grief-absolved I lie; Free to pine and perish, Love, since thou canst die. While the trees, like mourners, Bear my azure pall, Let the whirlwind scatter, Let the ashes fall, Striving towards no heaven Dim and distant far: Only where thou dwellest The Immortals are. SIMPLE TALES. I. What are they bringing to this grave, O Sexton pale and old? What blossom white, or blasted root, Must underlie this mould? Hark to the bell!âI cannot tell: We dig the grave, and ring the knell. If you must askâthat married pair, That move so stiff and sad, With snow-flakes thickening in their hair, In new-dyed sables clad; The kerchief busy at their eyes, That way, methinks, the burthen lies. In yonder moss-clad church, their pew Showed once a gracious child, A laughing imp of rosy hue In glee and mischief wild. To manhood grown, he went away, Returning in an evil day. âHo, rascals!â cries he, âtake my beast; Haste there, and let me in; My father keeps a sorry feast, My mother's sour and thin. I've come to change their ways a bit; Fetch brandy, fill a bumper fit! Squire, I have debts in yonder town; I fling the careless card; My tradesmen press their bills, and frown; My creditors are hard. This world is not a mother's breast, No cradle, for a babe to rest.â The mother scans him in the light Of the oriel deep and wide. Where are those curls and dimples bright, The cheek, her blushing pride? Whose touch could smooth that tangled hair, Now knotted, like a snaky snare? Nor this the worst: the bloodshot eye; The voice of scoffing tone; The lips unsteady, that defy The pleading of her own. In grief she struggles and sinks down: He answers with a sullen frown. The unwilling gold is quickly brought, And, silent, counted out; The seeker has the boon he sought, And flushing turns about. The mother speaks not to deplore; The father whispers, âCome no more. Your sister's portion here you take, Your mother's jointure too: Though all were beggared for your sake, It would not furnish you.â âOh! take it all,â the mother cries, And follows him with streaming eyes. I know this only, since that time A year or so has past. But seeds of misery and crime Ripen unearthly fast. The Hall's entailed, that cannot go; But there they keep with little show. And when I heard, three days agone, A young man at the inn Had, desperate, shut himself alone, And died the death of sin, I said, âThe Squire has lost his son; Wife, there's a grave must be begun.â How came this? through some hidden vein Of wildness in the blood, That penitence and deadly pain Could turn him not to good: So, when his drunken fury went, He might not bear his ill-content. Old man with burning eyes and hair Like ashes over flame, Look not too sternly on the heir Of deeper than thy name: Thy fiery youth, its guilt, its gains, Ran their traditions in his veins. Nor wanted he an angel friend; Still in his clouded eyes, With hope and promise run to end, His mother's look would rise, So prayer might bless his parting breath, And faith, long banished, come in death. II. He loved her long through grief and pain, As long she loved another. Life was to him her sole domain; He was to her a brother. When well of love he urged and spake, Tears on her eyelids glistened; The heart his wooing strove to wake Forsook him while she listened. Thus in a mutual twofold search Each deeper led the other. She was his wealth, his law, his church; He was to her a brother. God took him in his early years, Ere half his youth had flowered. Then she beheld him through her tears With the heart's saints embowered. Time on her heart's high daring smiled, A blooming bridal made her, And, clinging to a three-hours' child, In the low furrow laid her. But to my sight doth crowned appear Each faithful, fond endeavor: Ralph called her his, one happy year; And Herbert, his forever. THE ROSE IN THE JOURNAL. Rose, whose matchless beauty Poets love to praise, Bind the day that brought him To the other days; To the homely duties; To the things that are, Like dark weights of nature Linked to sun and star. Then the curtain lifted Of the tent so gray Showed him fresh and blooming As careering Day, Ere his steeds are wearied With the noontide heat, Ere the lengthening shadows Press his loitering feet. Like an Angel's garment Caught in fluttering grasp; Like a kingly jewel Set in costliest clasp; Like a sudden vision Of the joys that were, When the shadows darken And the end draws near,â Thus among my treasures, Rosebud, thou shalt lie, With thy beauty withering Only to the eye. Roses grow immortal On the brow of Fame: These, with all best glories, Deathless keep thy name. A DREAM OF DISTANCE. Coldly sunk, as the pearl in the wave, Is the love I have borne to thee: Over its stillness the waters lave Darkly, silently, heavily. All the chances under the sun Scarce can give that the sunken pearl See the light of the star she loves, Lifted out of the water's whirl. Of all the chances under the sun, For that one I'll ne'er seek nor pray: Let me lie where the tides move on; Thou, bright Lucifer, keep thy way! For the mystical pulse of life Holds in sympathy divine Things apart, like the star and pearl; Things akin, like thy soul and mine. FAME AND FRIENDSHIP. The world doth name thee now, and idle men Exalt their critic skill in praising thee: At all their words my heart doth bound again; And praise begetteth praise, as this should be. Yet I remember with a jealous love What time thine unmined wealth lay less in view; And I was fain the envious clods to move, And point the hidden diamonds clear as dew. Methought men's souls, unquestioning of art, Were then as void of pulse as stock or stone; Yet, gathering all thy glories in my heart, My slender trump uplifted them alone. So, when the arena rings with plaudits loud, Hear my heart's whisper through the noisy throng; And let thy fancies, running o'er the crowd, Pause where the rites of gratitude belong. For I have been a mother to thy fame, Coaxing with gentle touch the grasp of Fate; Till, holding high the blazon of thy name, I cried to all the world, âHe shall be great!â A WOMAN'S PRAYER. Father of great mercy! hear me mildly: One I love is tried and hindered sore; For the harrows of temptation wildly Tear his green and blooming purpose o'er. Send thine angels, as the Spring her beauties Rains on thorny branches wild and sear, Lighting up Life's worn and wintry duties With the glories they were made to bear. Send them in the panoply of heaven Like a cohort sheathed in burnished gold; Send them thick as falling dews of even With soft arms to shelter and infold. Send them, while I coin my life as ransom For the holy triumph they must win; Take the uncounted pulses of my bosom; Keep the thing I love from deadly sin. Slow the answer gathers, âStay thy pleading; From his birth my help around him lies: He, the angel in his breast unheeding, Should escape the legions of the skies.â THE LAST BIRD. Little Bird that singest Far atop this warm December day, Heaven bestead thee, that thou wingest, Ere the welcome song is done, thy way To more certain weather, Where, built high and solemnly, the skies, Shaken by no storm together, Fixed in vaults of steadfast sapphire rise! There the smile that mocks us Answers with its warm serenity; There the prison-ice that locks us Melts forgotten in a purple sea. There thy tuneful brothers, In the palm's green plumage waiting long, Mate them with the myriad others, Like a broken rainbow bound with song. Winter scarce is hidden, Veiled within this fair, deceitful sky: Fly, ere, from his ambush bidden, He descend in ruin swift and nigh! By the Summer stately, Truant, thou wast fondly reared and bred: Dost thou linger here so lately, Knowing not thy beauteous friend is dead,â Like to hearts, that, clinging Fervent where their first delight was fed, Move us with untimely singing Of the hopes whose blossom-time is sped? Beauties have their hour, Safely perched on the spring-budding tree: For the ripened soul is trust and power. And beyond, the calm eternity. FAREWELL TO HAVANA. My sight is blank, my heart is lorn; My tropic trance of joy I mourn,â That stolen summer of delight, Dreamed on the breast of wintry night, When sad, true souls abide the North, And we, love-truants, issued forth To find, with steady sail unfurled, The glowing centre of the world. The glorious sights went fleeting by; I had no hold on earth or sky: Two little hands, one helpless heart, Could claim and keep so small a part. A shadow of the stately palm; A burnish of the noontide calm; A dream of faces new and strange, Darkened and lit with sudden change; A joy of flowers unearthly fair In giant Nature's tangled hair; A joy of fruits of other hue And savor than my childhood knew; A sorrow, as the vista grew, Longer and lesser, cherished too; A pang of parting, heart-bereft Of all I had,âis all I've left. To cheer my journey what remains Towards the rude heights where Winter reigns? What love-nursed thought shall shield my breast Warmer than cloak or sable vest? One hope serene all comfort brings,â Who made thy bonds did lend thy wings; Who sends thee from this faery reign Once brought thee here, and may again. A WILD NIGHT. The storm is sweeping o'er the land, And raging o'er the sea: It urgeth sharp and dismal sounds, The Psalm of Misery. The straining of the cordage now, The creaking of a spar, The deep dumb shock the vessel feels When billows strike and jar,â It breathes of distant seamen's hearts That think upon their wives; Of wretches clinging to the mast, And wrestling for their lives. The clouds are flying through the sky Like spectres of affright: Yon pale witch moon doth blast them all With bleared and ghastly light. Great Demons flutter through the dark Flame touched, with dusky wing; And Passion crouches out of sight Like a forbidden thing. The blast doth scourge the forest through, Great oaks, and bushes small; And God, the fable of the fools, Looks silently on all. Oh! if He watches, as I know, Safe let Him keep our rest, And give my little ones and me The shelter of His breast. No harm shall come on earth, we trust; But, if mischance must be, Most let him help those weary souls That struggle with the sea! MOTHER'S NONSENSE. Where are the eyes of the Lovely One,â The sweet blue eyes of the Lovely One? Oh! here they shine To comfort mine, The cloudless eyes of the Lovely One. Where are the hands of the Lovely One,â The tiny hands of the Lovely One? They grasp the air, So small and fair, Seeking angel's fingers, my Lovely One! Where is the mouth of the Lovely One,â The cunning mouth of the Lovely One? I kiss it so, It cannot say no, The sweet wee mouth of the Lovely One. And where is the place of the Lovely One,â The happy place of the Lovely One? On mother's knee High throneth he; And her heart is the home of the Lovely One. THE BABE'S LESSON. I was saying âAvÃ¨, avÃ¨,â Over a lost delight, When Baby, scarce five moonlights old, Looked up with wondering sight. Then his untutored organ Caught up the tragic tone, And with my spent sigh blended soft A music of its own. I was weary of my burthen, Desiring not to be; When thus unto my thoughts discoursed The babe upon my knee: âWhy, mother, sighing ever? What boots thy cherished woe? What matter through the mighty sea If sweet or bitter flow? Behold thy gallant champion, New lighted from the skies! Strong arm and word, and heart of cheer, Are in him, blossom-wise. A man, and he who wrongs me Escapes his lesson not; But who should grieve my mother's heart Must dearly pay the scot. Then wait, thou silly mother, The days till I am grown: Thou knowest a many heart like thine Doth keep its watch alone. Set up Prayer's golden ladder That brings the heaven-sent joy; And with sweet hope and patient faith Nourish thy tender boy.â âI will, I will, my dearest, Else 'twere unblest to live; The heaven is wide above our head, And God is free to give. But I was not weeping, baby, Nor raising a hand of might; I was only saying AvÃ¨ Over a lost delight.â MY CRUCIFIX. Baby sweet is dying,âhe is dying. Place the crucifix above his head; It conveys a sympathetic sighing, Tears of kindred with the tears we shed. For no succor from this head anointed Do I bring its sorrow near his pain: Death must come where dying is appointed; But this dead one saith, âI live again.â Well I deem some virtue must be hidden In the hero heart that would not die: By those firm lips, Baby shall be bidden To take hope, and live immortally. CHOPIN. We saw him in the death-nest laid; His wings were folded, sad and still; The glowing tropic of his breast Endured no more Life's winter chill. But now, through Fancy's clouded gate, He walks with Nature's spirit-kings; The sceptre in his palsied hands Strikes rapture at her deepest springs. His life was like an opal gem That breaks in many a painful thrill: The risen rainbow of his soul The heaven of song is spanning still; While happy Love and Grief sublime Unite their emblems on his brow, And pave with zeal his shadowy court,â A Lover once, a Master now. A VISIT TO C. H. Let us sit with you, sister, before the low fire, The scanty rag-carpet sufficing our feet: You cannot command, and we need not require, The window well shaded and soft-cushioned seat. The children of pride scarcely come to your door, And we who have entered walk not in their ways; But experience brings to the rich and the poor One value abiding in life's changeful days. You are homely in breeding? Some one of your race Had a spark of high blood, to immortals akin: You are loath to be seen in this desolate place? What honor may lack where the Muse is within? A presence I feel in the God-lightened air, The spell of the art I have followed so long: In your calico garment and rough-twisted hair Let us speak of your queendom, poor sister of song. For, well may we know it, the tap that you hear, When you lay down the needle, and take up the pen, Is the summons august that the highest revere, The greatest that visits the children of men. The fountain of song in your bosom arose When the small baby pillow was tenantless left? You share with all mortals life's burthen of woes; But all have not music, when grieved and bereft. You dream o er the wash-tub, strive vainly to fix Your thought on the small household matter in hand? Some spices, no doubt, in your condiments mix, Some flavors your neighbors can scarcely command. The world is so hard, and the world is so cold? And the dear-bought deliverance comes scanty and slow? Say, whether is better,âits frosts to behold, Or to share its heart winter, and shed no more glow? I have found a rich blossom astray on the heath; In sordid surroundings, an altar of love; Or lashed in a cart, beyond beauty and breath, The steed that should carry the bidding of Jove. The town that hums near us has rich folk, besure,â Its man of the Congress, its Mayor with his state, Its lords of the spindle who pillage the poor, Its pampered young people who quarrel and mate. But not for their scanning I come here to-day; The rich and the proud are forever the same: My feet, poet sister, have found out this way, Unsought and unsummoned, your kinship to claim. HENRY WILSON'S SILVER WEDDING. The ancients had an age of gold, To silver thence descending, While yet in baser metal told The series had its ending. The golden time bore men divine; The silver, men heroic; The brazen did to deeds decline, Rebuked of sage and stoic. The mystic trine by Plato cast Was thus reversed from Nature: The gold was in the unknown Past, Not in the unknown Future. Our country knows the age of brass, Whose wary politician Digs in that ore the steps that pass To recognized position. But Wilson, from the lowlier base The silver vantage gaining, Climbs ever towards the golden grace, With labor uncomplaining. Well may the country thrive like him To whom her heart's beholden,â His Present's Silver never dim, His Future always Golden! WELCOME. They are coming, O our brothers! they are coming; From the formless distance creeps the growing sound, Like a rill-fed torrent, in whose rapid summing Stream doth follow stream, till waves of joy abound. These have languished in the shadow of the prison, Long with hunger pains and bitter fever low: Welcome back our lost, from living graves arisen, From the wild despite and malice of the foe. These have heard the cannon roar, the musket rattle; Where grim death affronted, these have flown before: Set their standards in the fiery tide of battle Till the red waves parted, and the right went o'er. As the Genii of the clouds refresh with water Plants and precious seeds that bear the life of States, These have poured their blood in meadows sown with slaughter, Where the harvest of the Land's redemption waits. Haste, ye mothers! let your household vigils slacken; In your glad attire arrayed, go banded forth: For these martial men, these ranks the sun doth blacken, Are your babes indeed, the jewels of the North. By the loves ye prize and live for, ask that never Need so sore again the heart of home invade: Neither brazen trump, nor wires that wail and quiver, Bid you yield the living, and take back the dead. Better let them build who rear the house of nations Than that Fate should rock it to foundation stone: Leave the earth her storms, the stars their perturbations, Steadfast welfare stays where Justice binds her zone. When the human faults that mix in human labor Miss the measure set to caution and constrain, Let the wise of heart instruct his ruder neighbor, Let the loving soul hold violence in chain. But when Falsehood lifts her challenge cry stupendous, When the fiery angel bars our gates of bliss, Ask the holy heavens such hosts again to lend us, With such leaders, such a righteous cause as this.
