      <field name="fulltext">Remarks on the Bright, and dark side of that American Pillar Mr. William Tompson. Pastor of the Church in Braintree. Who Triumphed December 10th. 1666 Aetat 68. But may a Rural Pen try to set forth Such a Great Fathers Ancient Grace and worth I undertake a no less Arduous Theme Then the Old Sages found the Chaldae Dream 'Tis more then Tythes of a profound respect That must be paid such a Melchizedeck Oxford this light with tongues and Arts doth trim And then his Northern Town doth Challeng him His Time and Strength he Center'd there in this To do good works, and be what now he is. His fulgent Virtues there and learned Strains Tall comely Presence, Life unsoil'd with Stains Things most on WORTHIES in their Stories writ Did him to move in Orbs of Service fitt Things more peculiar yet, my muse intend Say stranger things then these, so weep and End When he forsook first his Oxonian Cell Some Scores at once from Popish darkness fell So this Reformer studied! rare first fruits! Shakeing a Crab-tree thus by hot disputes The acid juice by miracle turn'd wine And rais'd the Spirits of our young Divine Hearers like Doves flock'd with contentios wing Who should be first, feed most: most homeward bring Laden with honey like Hyblaean Bees They knead it into combs upon their knees. Why he from Europes pleasant Garden fled In the Next Age will be with horrour said Braintree was of this Jewel then possest Untill himself he labour'd into Rest His Inventory then with Johns was took His rough Coat, Girdle with the Sacred Book When Reverend Knowles and he sail'd hand in hand To Christ, Espousing the Virginian Land Upon a ledge of Craggy Rocks near stav'd His Bible in his bosome thrusting sav'd The Bible, the best cordial of his Heart Come floods, come flames (cry'd he) we'l never part A constellation of great converts there Shone round him and his Heav'nly Glory where With a Rare Skill in hearts, this Doctor cou'd Steal into them words that should do them good His Balsom's from the Tree of Life distill'd Hearts cleans'd and heal'd, and with rich comforts fill'd But here's the wo! Balsoms which others cur'd Would in his Own Turn hardly be endur'd Apollyon Owing him a cursed Spleen Who an Apollos in the Church had been Dreading his Traffick here would be undone By Numerous proselites he daily won Accus'd him of Imaginary faults And push'd him down so into dismal Vaults Vaults where he kept long Ember weeks of grief 'Till Heav'n alarm'd sent him in relief Then was a Daniel in the lyons Den A man, oh how belov'd of God and men By his beds-side an Hebrew sword there lay With which at last he drove the Devil away. Quaker's too durst not bear his keen replies But fearing it half drawn the trembler flyes Like Lazarus new rais'd from Death appears The Saint that had been dead for many years Our Nehemiah said, shall such as I Desert my flock, and like a Coward fly Long had the Churches begg'd the Saints release Releas'd at last, he dies in Glorious peace The Night is not so long, but phosphors ray Approaching Glories doth on high display Faith's Eye in him discern'd the Morning Star His heart leap'd; Sure the Sun cannot be far In Extasies of Joy, he Ravish'd Cryes Love, Love the Lamb, the Lamb, in whome he dies. December. 10. 1666. Gulielmi Tompsoni Braintreensis. Ecclesiae Pastoris in Angliâ utraque Celeberimi vice. Epitaphium. Judicious Zeale: New-Englands Boanerges Lies Tombless: not to Spare the Churches Charges But that the world may know he lacks no Tomb Who in Ten thousand hearts commanded room. While thus the thundring Textman hidden lies Some Virgins slumber: Others wantonize. B. T. The Grammarians Funeral, OR, An ELEGY composed upon the Death of Mr. John Woodmancy, formerly a School-Master in Boston: But now Published upon the DEATH of the Venerable Mr. Ezekiel Chevers, The late and famous School-Master of Boston in New-England; Who Departed this Life the Twenty-first of August 1708. Early in the Morning. In the Ninety-fourth Year of his Age. Eight Parts of Speech this Day wear Mourning Gowns Declin'd Verbs, Pronouns, Participles, Nouns. And not declined, Adverbs and Conjunctions, In Lillies Porch they stand to do their functions. With Preposition; but the most affection Was still observed in the Interjection. The Substantive seeming the limbed best, Would set an hand to bear him to his Rest. The Adjective with very grief did say, Hold me by strength, or I shall faint away. The Clouds of Tears did over-cast their faces, Yea all were in most lamentable Cases. The five Declensions did the Work decline, And Told the Pronoun Tu, The work is thine: But in this case those have no call to go That want the Vocative, and can't say O! The Pronouns said that if the Nouns were there, There was no need of them, they might them spare: But for the sake of Emphasis they would, In their Discretion do what ere they could. Great honour was confer'd on Conjugations, They were to follow next to the Relations. Amo did love him best, and Doceo might Alledge he was his Glory and Delight. But Lego said by me he got his skill, And therefore next the Herse I follow will. Audio said little, hearing them so hot, Yet knew by him much Learning he had got. O Verbs the Active were, Or Passive sure, Sum to be Neuter could not well endure. But this was common to them all to Moan Their load of grief they could not soon Depone. A doleful Day for Verbs, they look so moody, They drove Spectators to a Mournful Study. The Verbs irregular, 'twas thought by some, Would break no rule, if they were pleas'd to come. Gaudeo could not be found; fearing disgrace He had with-drawn, sent Maereo in his Place. Possum did to the utmost he was able, And bore as Stout as if he'd been A Table. Volo was willing, Nolo some-what stout, But Malo rather chose, not to stand out. Possum and Volo wish'd all might afford Their help, but had not an Imperative Word. Edo from Service would by no means Swerve, Rather than fail, he thought the Cakes to Serve. Fio was taken in a fit, and said, By him a Mournful POEM should be made. Fero was willing for to bear a part, Altho' he did it with an aking heart. Feror excus'd, with grief he was so Torn, He could not bear, he needed to be born. Such Nouns and Verbs as we defective find, No Grammar Rule did their attendance bind. They were excepted, and exempted hence, But Supines, all did blame for negligence. Verbs Offspring, Participles hand-in-hand, Follow, and by the same direction stand: The rest Promiscuously did croud and cumber, Such Multitudes of each, they wanted Number. Next to the Corpse to make th' attendance even, Jove, Mercury, Apollo came from heaven. And Virgil, Cato, gods, men, Rivers, Winds, With Elegies, Tears, Sighs, came in their kinds. Ovid from Pontus hast's Apparrell'd thus, In Exile-weeds bringing De Tristibus: And Homer sure had been among the Rout, But that the Stories say his Eyes were out. Queens, Cities, Countries, Islands, Come All Trees, Birds, Fishes, and each Word in Um. What Syntax here can you expect to find? Where each one bears such discomposed mind. Figures of Diction and Construction, Do little: Yet stand sadly looking on. That such a Train may in their motion chord, Prosodia gives the measure Word for Word. Sic Maestus Cecinit, Benj. Tompson. New Englands Crisis Or a Brief Narrative, of NEW-ENGLANDS Lamentable Estate at present, compar'd with the former (but few) years of Prosperity. Occasioned by many unheard of Crueltyes practiced upon the Persons and Estates of its united Colonyes, without respect of Sex, Age or Quality of Persons, by the Barbarous Heathen thereof. Poetically Described. By a Well wisher to his Countrey. BOSTON. Printed and sold by John Foster, over against the Sign of the Dove. 1676 THE PROLOGUE. THe times wherein old Pompion was a Saint, When men far'd hardly yet without complaint On vilest Cates; the dainty Indian Maize Was eat with Clamp-shells out of wooden Trayes Under thatcht Hutts without the cry of Rent, And the best Sawce to every Dish, Content. When Flesh was food, and hairy skins made coats, And men as wel as birds had chirping Notes. When Cimnels were accounted noble bloud Among the tribes of common herbage food. Of Ceres bounty form'd was many a knack Enough to fill poor Robins Almanack. These golden times (too fortunate to hold) Were quickly sin'd away for love of gold. Twas then among the bushes, not the street If one in place did an inferiour meet, Good morrow Brother, is there ought you want? Take freely of me, what I have you ha'nt. Plain Tom and Dick would pass as currant now, As ever since Your Servant Sir and bow. Deep-skirted doublets, puritanick capes Which now would render men like upright Apes, Was comlier wear our wiser Fathers thought Than the cast fashions from all Europe brought. Twas in those dayes an honest Grace would hold Till an hot puddin grew at heart a cold. And men had better stomachs to religion Than I to capon, turkey-cock or pigeon. When honest Sisters met to pray not prate About their own and not their neighbours state. During Plain Dealings Reign, that worthy Stud Of th' ancient planters race before the flood These times were good, Merchants car'd not a rush For other fare than Jonakin and Mush. Although men far'd and lodged very hard Yet Innocence was better than a Guard. Twas long before spiders and wormes had drawn Their dungy webs or hid with cheating Lawne New-Englands beautyes, which stil seem'd to me Illustrious in their own simplicity. Twas ere the neighbouring Virgin-land had broke The Hogsheads of her worse than hellish smoak. Twas ere the Islands sent their Presents in, Which but to use was counted next to sin. Twas ere a Barge had made so rich a fraight As Chocholatte, dust-gold and bitts of eight. Ere wines from France and Moscovadoe too Without the which the drink will scarsly doe, From western Isles, ere fruits and dilicacies, Did rot maids teeth and spoil their hansome faces. Or ere these times did chance the noise of war Was from our towns and hearts removed far. No Bugbear Comets in the chrystal air To drive our christian Planters to despair. No sooner pagan malice peeped forth But Valour snib'd it; then were men of worth Who by their prayers slew thousands Angel like, Their weapons are unseen with which they strike. Then had the Churches rest, as yet the coales Were covered up in most contentious souls. Freeness in Judgment, union in affection, Dear love, sound truth they were our grand protection. These were the twins which in our Councells sate, These gave prognosticks of our future fate, If these be longer liv'd our hopes increase, These warrs will usher in a longer peace: But if New-Englands love die in its youth The grave will open next for blessed Truth. This Theame is out of date, the peacefull hours When Castles needed not but pleasant bowers. Not ink, but bloud and tears now serve the turn To draw the figure of New-Englands Urne. New-Englands hour of passion is at hand, No power except Divine can it withstand; Scarce hath her glass of fifty years run out, But her old prosperous Steeds turn heads about, Tracking themselves back to their poor beginnings, To fear and fare upon their fruits of sinnings: So that the mirrour of the Christian world Lyes burnt to heaps in part, her Streamers furl'd Grief reigns, joyes flee and dismal fears surprize, Not dastard spirits only but the wise. Thus have the fairest hopes deceiv'd the eye Of the big swoln Expectant standing by. Thus the proud Ship after a little turn Sinks into Neptunes arms to find its Urn. Thus hath the heir to many thousands born Been in an instant from the mother torn. Ev'n thus thine infant cheeks begin to pale, And thy supporters through great losses fail. This is the Prologue to thy future woe, The Epilogue no mortal yet can know. New-Englands Crisis. IN seventy five the Critick of our years Commenc'd our war with Phillip and his peers. Whither the sun in Leo had inspir'd A feav'rish heat, and Pagan spirits fir'd? Whither some Romish Agent hatcht the plot? Or whither they themselves? appeareth not. Whither our infant thrivings did invite? Or whither to our lands pretended right? Is hard to say; but Indian spirits need No grounds but lust to make a Christian bleed. And here methinks I see this greazy Lout With all his pagan slaves coil'd round about, Assuming all the majesty his throne Of rotten stump, or of the rugged stone Could yield; casting some bacon-rine-like looks, Enough to fright a Student from his books, Thus treat his peers, and next to them his Commons, Kennel'd together all without a summons. “My friends, our Fathers were not half so wise As we our selves who see with younger eyes. They sel our land to english man who teach Our nation all so fast to pray and preach: Of all our countrey they enjoy the best, And quickly they intend to have the rest. This no wunnegin, so big matchit law, Which our old fathers fathers never saw. These english make and we must keep them too, Which is too hard for them or us to doe, We drink we so big whipt, but english they Go sneep, no more, or else a little pay. Me meddle Squaw me hang'd, our fathers kept What Squaws they would whither they wakt or slept. Now if you'le fight Ile get you english coats, And wine to drink out of their Captains throats. The richest merchants houses shall be ours, Wee'l ly no more on matts or dwell in bowers Wee'l have their silken wives take they our Squaws, They shall be whipt by virtue of our laws. If ere we strike tis now before they swell To greater swarmes then we know how to quell. This my resolve, let neighbouring Sachems know, And every one that hath club, gun or bow.” This was assented to, and for a close He strokt his smutty beard and curst his foes. This counsel lightning like their tribes invade, And something like a muster's quickly made, A ragged regiment, a naked swarm, Whome hopes of booty doth with courage arm, Set forthwith bloody hearts, the first they meet Of men or beasts they butcher at their feet. They round our skirts, they pare, they fleece they kil, And to our bordering towns do what they will. Poor Hovills (better far then Caesars court In the experience of the meaner sort) Receive from them their doom next execution, By flames reduc'd to horror and confusion: Here might be seen the smoking funeral piles Of wildred towns pitcht distant many miles. Here might be seen the infant from the breast Snatcht by a pagan hand to lasting rest: The mother Rachel-like shrieks out my child She wrings her hands and raves as she were wild. The bruitish wolves suppress her anxious moan By crueltyes more deadly of her own. Will she or nill the chastest turtle must Tast of the pangs of their unbridled lust. From farmes to farmes, from towns to towns they post, They strip, they bind, they ravish, flea and roast. The beasts which wont their masters crib to know, Over the ashes of their shelters low. What the inexorable flames doe spare More cruel Heathen lug away for fare. These tidings ebbing from the outward parts Makes trades-men cast aside their wonted Arts And study armes: the craving merchants plot Not to augment but keep what they have got. And every soul which hath but common sence Thinks it the time to make a just defence. Alarums every where resound in streets, From West sad tidings with the Eastern meets. Our common fathers in their Councels close A martial treaty with the pagan foes, All answers center here that fire and sword Must make their Sachem universal Lord. This armes the english with a resolution To give the vaporing Scab a retribution. Heav'ns they consult by prayer, the best design A furious foe to quel or undermine. RESOLV'D that from the Massachusets bands Be prest on service some Herculean hands And certainly he wel deserv'd a jerke That slipt the Collar from so good a work. Some Volunteers, some by compulsion goe To range the hideous forrest for a foe. The tender Mother now's all bowels grown, Clings to her son as if they'd melt in one. Wives claspe about their husbands as the vine Huggs the fair elm, while tears burst out like wine. The new-sprung love in many a virgin heart Swels to a mountain when the lovers part. Nephews and kindred turn all springs of tears, Their hearts are so surpriz'd with panick fears. But dolefull shrieks of captives summon forth Our walking castles, men of noted worth, Made all of life, each Captain was a Mars, His name too strong to stand on waterish verse: Due praise I leave to some poetick hand Whose pen and witts are better at command. Methinks I see the Trojan-horse burst ope, And such rush forth as might with giants cope: These first the natives treachery felt, too fierce For any but eye-witness to rehearse. Yet sundry times in places where they came Upon the Indian skins they carv'd their name. The trees stood Centinels and bullets flew From every bush (a shelter for their crew) Hence came our wounds and deaths from every side While skulking enemies squat undiscri'd, That every stump shot like a musketeer, And bowes with arrows every tree did bear The swamps were Courts of Guard, thither retir'd The stragling blew-coats when their guns were fir'd, In dark Meanders, and these winding groves, Where Beares and panthers with their Monarch moves These far more cruel slily hidden lay, Expecting english men to move that way. One party lets them slip, the other greets Them with the next thing to their winding-sheets; Most fall, the rest thus startled back return, And from their by past foes receive an urn. Here fel a Captain, to be nam'd with tears, Who for his Courage left not many peers, With many more who scarce a number left To tell how treacherously they were bereft. This flusht the pagan courage, now they think The victory theirs, not lacking meat or drink. The ranging wolves find here and there a prey, And having fil'd their paunch they run away By their Hosts light, the thanks which they return Is to lead Captives and their taverns burn. Many whose thrift had stor'd for after use Sustain their wicked plunder and abuse. Poor people spying an unwonted light, Fearing a Martyrdom, in sudden fright Leap to the door to fly, but all in vain, They are surrounded with a pagan train; Their first salute is death, which if they shun Some are condemn'd the Gauntelet to run; Death would a mercy prove to such as those Who feel the rigour of such hellish foes. Posts daily on their Pegasean Steeds Bring sad reports of worse then Nero's deeds, Such bruitish Murthers as would paper stain Not to be heard in a Domitians Reign. The field which nature hid is common laid, And Mothers bodies ript for lack of aid. The secret Cabinets which nature meant To hide her master piece is open rent, The half formd Infant there receives a death Before it sees the light or draws its breath, Many hot welcomes from the natives arms Hid in their sculking holes many alarms Our brethren had, and weary weary trants, Sometimes in melting heats and pinching wants: Sometimes the clouds with sympathizing tears Ready to burst discharg'd about their ears: Sometimes on craggy hills, anon in bogs And miery swamps better befitting hogs, And after tedious Marches little boast Is to be heard of stewd or bakt or roast, Their beds are hurdles, open house they keep Through shady boughs the stars upon them peep, Their chrystal drink drawn from the mothers breast Disposes not to mirth but sleep and rest. Thus many dayes and weeks, some months run out To find and quell the vagabonding rout, Who like inchanted Castles fair appear, But all is vanisht if you come but near, Just so we might the Pagan Archers track With towns and merchandize upon their back; And thousands in the South who settled down To all the points and winds are quickly blown. At many meetings of their fleeting crew, From whom like haile arrows and bullets flew: The English courage with whole swarms dispute, Hundreds they hack in pieces in pursuit. Sed haud impunè, English sides do feel As well as tawny skins the lead and steel And some such gallant Sparks by bullets fell, As might have curst the powder back to Hell: Had only Swords these skirmishes decided All Pagan Sculls had been long since divided. The lingring war out-lives the Summer sun, Who hence departs hoping it might be done, Ere his return at Spring but ah hee'l find The Sword still drawn, men of unchanged mind. Cold winter now nibbles at hands and toes And shrewdly pinches both our friends and foes. Fierce Boreas whips the Pagan tribe together Advising them to fit for foes and weather: The axe which late had tasted Christian bloud Now sets its steely teeth to feast on wood. The forests suffer now, by waight constrein'd To kiss the earth with souldiers lately brain'd. The lofty oakes and ash doe wagge the head To see so many of their neighbours dead; Their fallen carcasses are caried thence To stand our enemies in their defence. Their Myrmidons inclos'd with clefts of trees Are busie like the ants or nimble bees: And first they limber poles fix in the ground, In figure of the heavens convex: all round They draw their arras-matts and skins of beasts, And under these the Elves do make their nests. Rome took more time to grow then twice six hours, But half that time will serve for indian bowers. A Citty shall be rear'd in one dayes space As shall an hundred english men out-face. Canonicus precincts there swarmes unite, Rather to keep a winter guard then fight. A dern and dismal swamp some Scout had found Whose bosome was a spot of rising ground Hedg'd up with mighty oakes, maples and ashes, Nurst up with springs, quick boggs and miery plashes, A place which nature coyn'd on very nonce For tygers not for men to be a sconce. Twas here these Monsters shapt and fac'd like men Took up there Rendezvouz and brumal den, Deeming the depth of snow, hail, frost and ice Would make our Infantry more tame and wise Then by forsaking beds and loving wives, Meerly for indian skins to hazzard lives: These hopes had something calm'd the boiling passion Of this incorrigible warlike nation. During this short Parenthesis of peace Our forces found, but left him not at ease. Here english valour most illustrious shone, Finding their numbers ten times ten to one. A shower of leaden hail our captains feel Which made the bravest blades among us reel. Like to some ant-hill newly spurn'd abroad, Where each takes heels and bears away his load: Instead of plate and jewels, indian trayes With baskets up they snatch and run their wayes. Sundry the flames arrest and some the blade, By bullets heaps on heaps of Indians laid. The Flames like lightening in their narrow streets Dart in the face of every one it meets. Here might be heard an hideous indian cry, Of wounded ones who in the Wigwams fry. Had we been Canibals here might we feast On brave Westphalia gammons ready drest. The tauny hue is Ethiopick made Of such on whome Vulcan his clutches laid. There fate was sudden, our advantage great To give them once for all a grand defeat; But tedious travell had so crampt our toes It was too hard a task to chase the foes. Distinctness in the numbers of the slain, Or the account of Pagans which remain Are both uncertain, losses of our own Are too too sadly felt, too sadly known. War digs a common grave for friends and foes, Captains in with the common souldier throws. Six of our Leaders in the first assault Crave readmission to their Mothers Vault Who had they fell in antient Homers dayes Had been enrol'd with Hecatombs of praise. As clouds disperst, the natives troops divide, And like the streames along the thickets glide. Some breathing time we had, and short God knowes But new alarums from recruited foes Bounce at our eares, the mounting clouds of smoak From martyr'd townes the heav'ns for aid invoke: Churches, barns, houses with most ponderous things Made volatile fly ore the land with wings. Hundreds of cattle now they sacrifice For aiery spirits up to gormandize; And to the Molech of their hellish guts, Which craves the flesh in gross, their ale in butts. Lancaster, Medfield, Mendon wildred Groton, With many Villages by me not thought on Dy in their youth by fire that usefull foe, Which this grand cheat the world will overflow. The wandring Priest to every one he meets Preaches his Churches funeral in the streets. Sheep from their fold are frighted, Keepers too Put to their trumps not knowing what to doe. This monster Warre hath hatcht a beauteous dove In dogged hearts, of most unfeigned love, Fraternal love the livery of a Saint Being come in fashion though by sad constraint, Which if it thrive and prosper with us long Will make New-England forty thousand strong. But off the Table hand, let this suffice As the abridgment of our miseryes. If Mildew, Famine, Sword, and fired Townes, If Slaughter, Captivating, Deaths and wounds, If daily whippings once reform our wayes, These all will issue in our Fathers Praise; If otherwise, the sword must never rest Till all New-Englands Glory it divest. A Supplement. WHat meanes this silence of Harvardine quils While Mars triumphant thunders on our hills. Have pagan priests their Eloquence confin'd To no mans use but the mysterious mind? Have Pawaws charm'd that art which was so rife To crouch to every Don that lost his life? But now whole towns and Churches fire and dy Without the pitty of an Elegy. Nay rather should my quils were they all swords Wear to the hilts in some lamenting words. I dare not stile them poetry but truth, The dwindling products of my crazy youth. If these essayes shall raise some quainter pens Twil to the Writer make a rich amends. Marlburyes Fate When Londons fatal bills were blown abroad And few but Specters travel'd on the road, Not towns but men in the black bill enrol'd Were in Gazetts by Typographers sold: But our Gazetts without Errataes must Report the plague of towns reduct to dust: And feavers formerly to tenants sent Arrest the timbers of the tenement. Ere the late ruines of old Groton's cold, Of Marlbury's peracute disease we're told. The feet of such who neighbouring dwellings urnd Unto her ashes, not her doors return'd And what remaind of tears as yet unspent Are to its final gasps a tribute lent. If painter overtrack my pen let him An olive colour mix these elves to trim: Of such an hue let many thousand thieves Be drawn like Scare-crows clad with oaken leaves, Exhausted of their verdant life and blown From place to place without an home to own. Draw Devils like themselves, upon their cheeks The banks for grease and mud, a place for leeks. Whose locks Medusaes snakes, do ropes resemble, And ghostly looks would make Achilles tremble. Limm them besmear'd with Christian Bloud and oild With fat out of white humane bodyes boil'd. Draw them with clubs like maules and full of stains, Like Vulcans anvilling New-Englands brains. Let round be gloomy forrests with crag'd rocks Where like to castles they may hide their flocks, Till oppertunity their cautious friend Shall jogge them fiery worship to attend. Shew them like serpents in an avious path Seeking to sow the fire-brands of their wrath. Most like AEneas in his cloak of mist, Who undiscover'd move where ere they list Cupid they tell us hath too sorts of darts. One sharp and one obtuse, one causing wounds, One piercing deep the other dull rebounds, But we feel none but such as drill our hearts. From Indian sheaves which to their shoulders cling, Upon the word they quickly feel the string. Let earth be made a screen to hide our woe From Heavens Monarch and his Ladyes too; And least our Jealousie think they partake, For the red stage with clouds a curtain make. Let dogs be gag'd and every quickning sound Be charm'd to silence, here and there all round The town to suffer, from a thousand holes Let crawle these fiends with brands and fired poles, Paint here the house and there the barn on fire, With holocausts ascending in a spire. Here granaries, yonder the Churches smoak Which vengeance on the actors doth invoke. Let Morpheus with his leaden keyes have bound In feather-beds some, some upon the ground, That none may burst his drowsie shackles till The bruitish pagans have obtain'd their will, And Vulcan files them off then Zeuxis paint The phrenzy glances of the sinking saint. Draw there the Pastor for his bible crying, The souldier for his sword, The Glutton frying With streams of glory-fat, the thin-jaw'd Miser Oh had I given this I had been wiser. Let here the Mother seem a statue turn'd At the sad object of her bowels burn'd. Let the unstable weakling in belief Be mounting Ashurs horses for relief. Let the half Convert seem suspended twixt The dens of darkness, and the Planets fixt, Ready to quit his hold, and yet hold fast By the great Atlas of the Heavens vast. Paint Papists mutterring ore their apish beads Whome the blind follow while the blind man leads. Let Ataxy be mounted on a throne Imposing her Commands on every one, A many-headed monster without eyes To see the wayes which wont to make men wise. Give her a thousand tongues with wings and hands To be ubiquitary in Commands, But let the concave of her skull appear Clean washt and empty quite of all but fear, One she bids flee, another stay, a third She bids betake him to his rusty sword, This to his treasure, th'other to his knees, Some counsels she to fry and some to freeze, These to the garison, those to the road, Some to run empty, some to take their load: Thus while confusion most mens hearts divide Fire doth their small exchecquer soon decide. Thus all things seeming ope or secret foes, An Infant may grow old before a close, But yet my hopes abide in perfect strength. New England will be prosperous once at length. The Town called Providence Its fate. Why muse wee thus to see the wheeles run cross Since Providence it self sustaines a loss: And yet should Providence forget to watch I fear the enemy would all dispatch; Celestial lights would soon forget their line, The wandering planets would forget to shine, The stars run all out of their common spheres, And quickly fall together by the eares: Kingdoms would jostle out their Kings and set The poor Mechanick up whome next they met, Or rather would whole kingdoms with the world Into a Chaos their first egge be hurl'd. Ther's none this Providence of the Most High Who can survive and write its Elegie: But of a solitary town I write, A place of darkness yet receiving light From pagan hands, a miscellanious nest Of errors Hectors, where they sought a rest Out of the reach of Lawes but not of God, Since they have felt the smart of common rod. Twas much I thought they did escape so long, Who Gospel truth so manifestly wronge: For one Lots sake perhaps, or else I think Justice did at greatest offenders wink But now the shott is paid, I hope the dross Will be cashiered in this common loss. Houses with substance feel uplifting wings, The earth remains, the last of humane things: But know the dismal day draws neer wherein The fire shall earth it self dissolve and sin. Seaconk Plain Engagement. On our Pharsalian Plaines, comprizing space For Caesars host brave Pompey to outface, An handfull of our men are walled round With Indian swarmes; anon their pieces sound A Madrigal like heav'ns artilery Lightning and thunderbolts their bullets fly. Her's hosts to handfulls, of a few they leave Fewer to tell how many they bereave. Fool-hardy fortitude it had been sure Fierce storms of shot and arrows to endure Without all hopes of some requital to So numerous and pestilent a foe. Some musing a retreat and thence to run, Have in an instant all their business done, They sink and all their sorrows ponderous weight Down at their feet they cast and tumble straight. Such who outliv'd the fate of others fly Into the Irish bogs of misery. Such who might dye like men like beasts do range Uncertain whither for a better change, These Natives hunt and chase with currish mind, And plague with crueltyes such as they find. When shall this shower of Bloud be over? When? Quickly we pray oh Lord! say thou Amen. Seaconk or Rehoboths Fate. I once conjectur'd that those tygers hard To reverend Newmans bones would have regard, But were all SAINTS they met twere all one case, They have no rev'rence to an Angels face: But where they fix their griping lions paws They rend without remorse or heed to laws. Rehoboth here in common english, Rest They ransack, Newmans Relicts to molest. Here all the town is made a publick stage Whereon these Nimrods act their monstrous rage. All crueltyes which paper stain'd before Are acted to the life here ore and ore. Chelmsfords Fate. Ere famous Winthrops bones are laid to rest The pagans Chelmsford with sad flames arrest, Making an artificial day of night By that plantations formidable light. Here's midnight shrieks and Soul-amazing moanes, Enough to melt the very marble stones: Fire-brands and bullets, darts and deaths and wounds Confusive outcryes every where resounds: The natives shooting with the mixed cryes, With all the crueltyes the foes devise Might fill a volume, but I leave a space For mercyes still successive in there place Not doubting but the foes have done their worst, And shall by heaven suddenly be curst. Let this dear Lord the sad Conclusion be Of poor New-Englands dismal tragedy. Let not the glory of thy former work Blasphemed be by pagan Jew or Turk: But in its funeral ashes write thy Name So fair all Nations may expound the same: Out of her ashes let a Phoenix rise That may outshine the first and be more wise. B. Tompson. On A FORTIFICATION At Boston begun by Women. Dux Foemina Facti. A Grand attempt some Amazonian Dames Contrive whereby to glorify their names, A Ruff for Boston Neck of mud and turfe, Reaching from side to side from surfe to surfe, Their nimble hands spin up like Christmas pyes, Their pastry by degrees on high doth rise. The wheel at home counts it an holiday, Since while the Mistris worketh it may play. A tribe of female hands, but manly hearts Forsake at home their pasty-crust and tarts To knead the dirt, the samplers down they hurle, Their undulating silks they closely furle. The pick-axe one as a Commandress holds, While t'other at her awkness gently scolds. One puffs and sweats, the other mutters why Cant you promove your work so fast as I? Some dig, some delve, and others hands do feel The little waggons weight with single wheel. And least some fainting fits the weak surprize, They want no sack nor cakes, they are more wise. These brave essayes draw forth Male stronger hands More like to Dawbers then to Martial bands: These do the work, and sturdy bulwarks raise, But the beginners well deserve the praise. New-Englands Tears FOR HER Present Miseries: OR, A Late and True RELATION of the CALAMITIES of NEW-ENGLAND Since APRIL last past. With an Account of the Battel between the English and Indians upon Seaconk Plain: And of the Indians Burning and Destroying of Marlbury, Rehoboth, Chelmsford, Sudbury, and Providence. With the Death of Antonomies the Grand Indian Sachem; And a RELATION of a Fortification begun by Women upon Boston Neck. Together with an Elegy on the Death of John Winthrop Esq; late Governour of Connecticott, and Fellow of the Royal Society. Written by an Inhabitant of Boston in New England to his Friend in London. With Allowance. LONDON Printed for N. S. 1676. A NARRATIVE OF New Englands PRESENT CALAMITIES. 15 April 1676. WHAT means this silence of Harvardine Quills Whilst Mars Triumphant thunders on our Hills? Have Pagan Priests their Eloquence confin'd To no mans use but the mysterious Mind? Have PAWAWS charm'd that Art which was so rife To crouch to every DON that lost his life? But now whole Towns and Churches fire and die, Without the pity of an Elegy. Nay, rather should my Quills, were they all Swords, Wear to the Hilts in some lamenting words: I dare not stile them Poetry, but Truth, The dwindling products of my crazie youth; If these Essays shall rouze some quainter Pens 'Twill to the Author make a rich amends. Marlburies Fate. WHen London's fatal Bills were blown abroad, And few but Specters travel'd on the Road, Not Towns, but Men in the black page inroll'd Were in Gazets by Typographers sold; But our Gazets without Errata's Must Report the Plague of Towns reduc'd to Dust: And Feavors, but ere while to Tenants sent Arrest the Timbers of the Tenement. Ere the late ruines of poor Groton's cold, Of Marlburies peracute Disease we're told; The feet of such, who neighb'ring dwellings urn'd Unto its ashes, not its doors return'd. So what remain'd of Tears as yet unspent Are to its final gasps a Tribute lent. If Painter ever track my Pen, let him An Olive colour mix, these Elves to trim; Of such an hue, let many hundred Thieves Be drawn like Scarecrows clad with Oaken leaves, Exhausted of their Verdant Life, and blown From place to place without a home to own: Draw Devils like themselves, upon their cheeks Those Banks of Grease and Mud a plat for Leeks; Whose dangling Locks Medusa's Snakes resemble, With grizly looks would make Achilles tremble. Limn them besmear'd with Christian blood, and oyl'd With fat out of white humane Bodies boyld. Draw them with Clubs like Mauls, all full of stains; Like Vulcan's anvelling New Englands brains: Let round be gloomy Forrests, and thick Rocks; Where like to Castles they may hide their Flocks: Till opportunity their constant friend, Shall jogge them Vulcan's Worship to attend. Shew them like Serpents in an avious path, Waiting to sow the Fire-balls of their wrath. Much like AEneas, in his cloak of mist, Who undiscover'd, move where ere they list. Cupid some tell us, had two sorts of Darts, But we feel none, but such as drill our hearts; From Indian sheaves which to their shoulders cling, Upon the Word they quickly feel the string. Hide first the Sun beneath the Earth, and quench In Thetis boul the Stars; the Lunar Wench So mutable in fashions, make her happe To lie a slumbering in Apollo's lappe. Let Earth be made a Screen to hide our woe, From Heaven's Monarch, and his Ladies too: And least our jealousie think they partake, For the Red Stage with Clouds a Curtain make. Let Doggs be gagg'd, and every quickning sound, Be charm'd to silence: here and there all round, The Town, to suffer. From a thousand holes Let crawl those Fiends with brands and firing Poles. Paint here an House and there a Barn on fire, With Holocausts ascending in a spire. Here Granaries, yonder the Churches smoke, Which Vengeance on the Actors did invoke. Let Morpheus with his Leaden Keys have bound In Feather beds some, some upon the Ground, That none may burst his drousie Shackles till The Bruitish Pagans have obtain'd their will, And Vulcan files them off. Then Zeuxis paint The phrensie glances of the Sinking Saint. Draw there the Pastor for his Bible crying, The Souldier for his Sword, the Glutton frying With Streams of glory fat. The thin-jaw'd Miser, Ah had I given this, I had been wiser. Let here the Mother seem a Statue turn'd, At the sad object of her Bowels burn'd. Let the unstable Weakling in belief, Be mounting Ashur's Horses for relief. Let the half Convert seem suspended 'twixt The Dens of Darkness and the Planets fixt. Ready to quit his hold and yet hold fast By the great Atlas of the Heavens vast. Paint Papists mutt'ring over apish Beads, Whom the Blind follow while the Blindman leads. Let ATTAXIE be mounted on a Throne, Imposing her Commands on every one: A many-headed Monster without Eyes, To see the Wayes which wont to make men wise. Give her a Thousand Tongues with Wings and Hands To be Ubiquitary in commands: But let the Concave of her Soul appear, Washt Clean and Empty, quite of all but fear. One she bids run, another stay, a third She bids betake him to his rusty Sword; This to his treasure, t'other to his Knees, Some Counsels she to fry, and some to freeze: These to the Garrisons, those to the Load; Some to run empty, some to take the Load. Thus while Confusion, most mens hearts divide, Fire doth the small Exchequer soon decide. Thus all things seeming ope or secret foes, An Infant may grow gray before a close. But yet my hopes remain in perfect strength, New England will be prosperous once at length. Providences Fate. WHy muse we thus, to see the Wheels run cross, Since Providence it self, sustains a loss: Should Providence, but one day miss its watch, I fear the Enemy would all dispatch. Resplendent Phoebus would forget to shine, The wandring Planets, to forget their Line. The Stars run all out of their proper spheres, And quickly fall together by the eares; The Ocean would forget to ebbe and flow, The Mother cease the tender babe to know. Kingdoms would jostle out their Kings and set, The Vile Mechanick up who next they met: Or rather Kings, and Kingdoms, with the World, Would into Chaos its first rise be turn'd: This sacred Providence of the Most High, None can outlive and write its Elegy. But of a solitary Town I write, A place of darkness, yet receiving light From Pagans hands; a miscellaneous nest Of Errours, Hectors, where they sought a rest Out of the reach of Laws, but not of God; Since they have smarted by the common Rod. 'Twas much I thought it did escape so long, Which sacred truth did manifestly wrong; For one Lots sake perhaps, or else I think, Justice did long at great offenders wink. 'Tis happy for them, if their filth and dross, Be cleansed off, though by a common loss. Seaconk Plain Engagement. ON our Pharsalian Plain, containing space For Caesar's Armies, Pompey's to outface, An handful of our men are walled round, With Tawny Bands, anon their pieces sound A Madrigal; like Hail the Bullets fly, An Emblem of Heavens Artillery. Heres Hosts to Handfuls, of a few they leave Fewer to tell how many they bereave. Fool hardy Fortitude, it had been sure, Thousands of Shot, and Arrows to endure: Without all hopes of some requital too, So numerous and pestilent a foe. Most Fought like Dragons; through this Indian mist, The Beams of Valour break where e'r they list. Who died ('tis thought) sold lives at such a rate, As doth the fury of the foes abate. Some musing a Retreat, and thence to run, Have in an instant, all their business done. They Sink, and Die, their wonted sorrows weight, They Tumble at their Feet, and follow strait. Here Captious ones, without their Queries lie, The Quaker here, the Presbiterian by. The Scruple dormant lies of thee and thou, And most as one to Deaths dominion bow. Such who out-live the fate of others fly, Into the Neighbouring Swamps of misery. Those who might die like men, like beasts must range, Uncertain whither for a better change. Such Natives hunt and chase with Tygers mind, And plague with Cruelties such as they find. When shall this showre of Blood be over? when? Quickly we pray (good Lord) say thou Amen. Rehoboth's Fate. I Once conjectur'd that these Figures hard, To reverend Newman's Bones would have regard. But were all Saints they met, it were all one case, They owe no Reverence to an Angels Face. But where they fix their Monstrous Lion Paw's, They Rend without remorse or heed to Laws Rehoboth here in our plain English Rest, They ransack, NEWMAN's Reliques they molest. Here all the Town is made a publick stage, Whereon these Nimrods act their Monstrous rage; And Cruelties which Paper stain'd before, Are acted to the life here ore and ore. Let this, dear Lord, the sad Conclusion be Of poor New-Englands fatal Tragedie. Let not the Glory of thy former work, Blasphemed lie by Pagan, Jew, or Turk. But in New-Englands Ashes write thy Name, So fair all Nations may expound the same. Out of these Ruins, let a Phoenix rise, That may outshine the first, and be more wise. Another black Parenthesis of woe, The Printer wills that all the world should know. Upon the setting of that Occidental Star John Winthrop Esq; Governour of Connecticott Colony, Member of the Royal Society; who deceased in his Countreys Service 6 April 1676. NIne Muses, get you all but one to sleep, But spare Melpomene, with me to weep. From you whose bleared Eyes have Lectures read, Of many of our English Heroe's dead. I beg a glance from Spectacles of Woe, (Quotidian Gazets) Brave Winthrop to. Whose death Terrestrial Comets did portend, To every one who was his Countreys friend. The Blaze of Towns was up like Torches light, To guide him to his Grave, who was so fit To rule, or to obey, to live or die: (A special Favorite of the Most High) Monarch of Natures Secrets, who did hold, Its grand Elixir named the Star of GOLD. Or else the World mistakes, and by his deeds, Of Daily Charities Expence he needs. But had he it, he wiser was than so, That every Ape of Artists should it know. He had the System of the Universe, Too Glorious for any to Rehearse. As Moses took the Law in Clouds and Fire; Which Vulgars barr'd at distance much admire. Thus was he taught the precious Art of healing, (Judge we but by success) at Gods revealing. He mounted up the Stairs of Sciences, Unto the place of Visions which did please. Where on the Pinacle of worldly skill, On Kingdoms of all Arts, he gaz'd his fill. Into his Thoughts Alembick we may think, He crouded Stars to make a Diet Drink. (I mean) Terrestrial Stars which in the Earth, Receive their vitals and a Mineral Birth: That Proteus, Mercury, he could compel, Most soberly well fixt at home to dwell. Of Salt (which Cooks do use for Eggs and Fishes) He made a Balsom better than all Riches; And Sulphur too provided for mens woe, He made an Antidote Diseases to. This Terrene three, were made by Fire his friends, To bring about his ARCHIATRICK ends. He saw the World, which first had only shade, And after rich Embroideries on it laid, Of Glorious Light; how the Homogeneal spark, Did first Rebell against the Central dark. He saw the Jemms how first they budded, and The Birth of Minerals, which put to stand Natures grand Courtiers. He knew the Womb From whom the Various Tribes of Herbs did come. He had been round the Philosophick sea, And knew the Tincture if there any be: But all his Art must lie, there's no Disease Predominant, where he doth take his Ease: Outliving Theophrast, he shew'd thereby Himself Hermetick, more surpassing high TRISMEGESTOS I'll stile him; first in Grace, Thrice great in ART, the next deserving place; Thrice High in humble Carriage, and who, Would not to Highest Meekness ready bow? England and Holland did great Winthrop woe; Both had experienc'd Wonders he could doe. But poor New-England stole his humble Heart, From whose deep Wounds he never would depart: His Councel Balsome like, he poured in, And plaistred up its Breaches made by sin. Natives themselves, in parlies would confess, Brave Winthrops Charity and Holiness. The Time he rul'd, War never toucht his bound, When Fire, and Sword, and Death, raged all round. Above whose reach he reigns in Glories Rays, Singing with all the Saints his Makers praise. EPITAPHIUM GReater Renown than Boston could contain, Doth underneath this Marble-stone remain: Which could it feel but half so well as we, 'Twould melt to Tears and let its Prisoner free. Chelmsfords Fate. ERe Famous Winthrops Bones are laid to rest, The Pagans Chelmsford with sad Flames arrest; Making an artificial day of night, By that Plantations formidable light. Here's midnight shreekes, and soul amazing groanes, Enough to melt the very Marble-stones: Fire-brands, and Bullets, Darts, and Deaths, and Wounds, Confusive Noyses every where resounds: The Natives shouting, with the English cries: With all the Cruelties the Foes devise, Might fill a Volume: but I leave a space, For mercies yet successive in their place: Not doubting but the foes have done their worst, And shall by Heaven, suddainly be curst. Sudburies Fate. ONce more run Lacquey Muse the Councel tell, What sad Defeat our hopeful Band befell: Since Fifty odd of Valours choicest Sons, Sinke into Deaths retiring Room at once. The Natives Scouts, like living baits were trail'd, With Umbrages of mighty Rocks and Holes; (Fit Pallaces for such perfideous souls. Some to our Linx-ey'd Centinels appear, And quickly run as if possest with fear: Ours chase, they halt; We gain, they lightly fly, As if some Gad be stung upon the Thigh. One while they linger, falsly to give hope, While to trapan, is their disguized scope; Into a Labyrinth) or a natural maze, Of hideous thickets and unbeaten wayes; Ours close pursue them, and as close their fate, Smelling their Treachery when 'twas too late, A Race of Natives, as if newly hatcht, Starts from their Dens, and soon our friends dispatch, Here was of Indians too a plenteous Fair, The Chapmen Devils, hovering in the Air: But ah with Tears I may the Reader tell, A little Host of English down there fell: Two hardy Captains, many manly hearts, Then felt the Bullets with the venom'd darts, The Parents Vesture with the purple stain'd Of his Ascanius by him newly braind. Euryalus his Soul reaks through the wound, Of Nisus gasping by upon the ground; While the Rutilian like enraged bears, The Garments; with Mens Skins, asunder tears: One seeks his Head, scrambling for breathing room, By Lethal pangs; a second reads his doom In Vellome Rolls, flead off his right hand man: Which they send home for Sagamores to tan; With Scalpes, according to whose number they, Receive brave Titles and some rich Array: Our numerous Scars, like stars in bodies shone, Who have for each a glorious Trophie wone: From this Aceldama they post away, To the Grand General for their ready pay: While fellow Soudiers who escape the dint, Bounce our Exchecquers, but find little in't. CELEUSMA MILITARE. BUt know stout hearts that Diadems and Crowns, Will powre down from Heaven after your wounds; And you shall find in Honours Lists a place, Where Dastard Spirits dare not shew their Face. About this time Died Major Willard Esq; who had continued one of our Senators many years, and Head of the Massachuset Bands. In 23 April 1676. EPITAPHIUM. GReat, Good, and Just, Valiant, and Wise, New-Englands common Sacrifice: The Prince of War, the Bond of Love, A True Heroic Martial Dove: Pardon I croud his Parts so close, Which all the World in measure knows. We envy Death, and well we may, Who keeps him under Lock and Key. His Praises will, or are more largely celebrated; but let this be accepted according to the Nature of my Writings, which are but Brief and General. The Indians threaten to Dine at Boston on our Election. THe hungry Dogs, scenting the bay good Cheer, Give out Bravadoes that they will be here. But hopes we have of an Election day, Although their Votes and Proxies keep away. We think they will our Ammunition smell, Which from our friends beyond Sea us befell. M. J. Antonomies the Grand Sachems Death. A Breathing time of silence had my Pen, But finds a scribling matter once agen. In Narraganset Land near Paquetuck, The English with the Natives try a pluck: Here in an Isthmus pitcht the foes their tents, Here quartered their naked Regiments: Some grope for Lobsters, some to clamp banks run, And some lie beautifying in the Sun: Some sit in Council, others treating squaws; Some grinding parcht Corn with the Querns their Jawes. Some sing their Captains dooms, others are lousing, Some pawawing, some wenching, and some drousing. And herein ANTONOMIE among the rest, All up in Wampam Belts, most richly drest: Sate as the Dagon of their motley crew, Not thinking that his downfal would insue: Whose Pedegree should I presume to write, To Hesiods Theognis run I might. Our Checquer'd Bands of Whites and Tawnies joyn'd, These in their close Retirements quickly find; Down to the Earth our Martial gallants fall, And like to insects on the Natives crawl. Old UNCUS tribe who ever had been true, Upon the moving Forrest nimbly flew. The English them as they are flying meet, And multitudes they tumble at their feet. Some captiv'd, others wounded, many slain, Like Hydra's Heads, yet ne'r the less remain. And here that Lucifer receives defeat, Who scorns with any less then Princes treat. What Necklace could New-England better please, Then Heads strung thick upon a thred of these, Him they dispatch, and hundreds more are hurl'd, Him to attend upon in th'other world: Whose hunting bouts will heavily go on, His Legs must stay until the Head come on. That phansie which so stifly they maintain, That such on hunting go who hence are slain: I hope ere long will quite convinced be, By many Heads chopt off as fine as he: His (a brave present) kist the grateful Hand, Of Dons who in our Southern Tract command. Least such Moecaenas's beyond Sea should, Restrain their yearly showrs of Goods and Gold, Be pleas'd to know there is an hopeful race, Who as you oft have been inform'd have grace. These are confin'd under Christian Wings, And hopes we have never to feel their stings. A natural Prison wall'd with Sea and Isles, From our Metropolis not many miles, Contains their swarms: hither upon advice, Some Grandees venturing powerful and wise; In a small Vessel on a time did tend, Three Dons with their great Apostolick friend: Ere they arrive a Barge runs down their Boat, Mean-while these Worthies three must sink or float. Their Loaves for comfort round about them swam, And from their Bottles Neptune drinks a dram, He gap'd for men and all, but as God pleas'd By sturdy tackles of that care he's eas'd, With like observance to November's day, Keep the remembrance of this passage pray. On the Fortifications began by Women upon Boston Neck. A Grand attempt the Amazonian dames, Contrive, whereby to glorify their names. A Ruffe for Bostons Neck of mud and turfe, Reaching from side to side, from surfe to surfe. Their nimble Hands spin up like Christmass Pies. Their pastry by degrees on high doth rise. Their Wheeles at home count it an Holyday While Mistresses are working they may play. A tribe of Peticoates with manly hearts, Forsake at home their Pasticrust and Tarts: To knead the dirt, their Samplers down they hurle, Their undulating Silks they closely furle. The Pickaxe one as a Commandress holds, Another at her awkness gently scolds. One holds her side, while Hypocondrick fumes, Do tympanize her Pericardian roomes This puffs and sweats, the other grumbles why Can't you promote your work so fast as I. Some dig and delve, while others hands do feel, The little Waggons weight with single wheel; And least some fainting fit, the weak surprize, They want not Sack and Cakes; they are more wise. These brave Essays drew forth mens nervous hands, More like to Daubers than to Martial Bands. These do the work and sturdy Bulwarks raise, But those who first began deserve the praise. FINIS. A FUNERAL TRIBUTE To the Honourable Dust of that most Charitable Christian, Unbiassed Politician, And unimitable Pyrotechnist John Winthrope esq: A Member of the Royal Society, and Governour of Conecticut Colony in NEW-ENGLAND. Who expired in his Countreys Service, April. 6th. 1676. ANother Black Parenthesis of woe The Printer wills that all the World should know Sage Winthrop prest with publick sorrow Dies As the Sum total of our Miseries: A Man of worth who well may ranked be Not with the thirty but the peerless three Of Western Worthies, Heir to all the Stock Of praise his Sire received from his Flock: GREAT WINTHROPS Name shall never be forgotten Till all NEW-ENGLANDS Race be dead and rotten; That Common Stock of all his Countries weal Whom Grave and Tomb-stone never can conceal. Three Colonies his PATIENTS bleeding lie Deserted by their great PHYSICIANS eye; Whose common sluice is poized for their tears, And Gates fly open to a Sea of fears. His Christian Modesty would never let His Name be near unto his SAVIOURS set: Yet Miracles set by, hee'd act his part Better to LIFE then Doctors of his Art. Projections various by fire he made Where Nature had her common Treasure laid. Some thought the tincture Philosophick lay Hatcht by the Mineral Sun in WINTHROPS way; And clear it shines to me he had a Stone Grav'd with his Name which he could read alone. To say how like a SCEVOLA in Court Or ancient CONSULS Histories report I here forbear, hoping some learned Tongue Will quaintly write, and not his Honour wrong. His common Acts with brightest lustre shone, But in Apollo's Art he was alone. Sometimes Earths veins creeping from endless holes Would stop his plodding eyes: anon the Coals Must search his Treasure, conversant in use Not of the Mettals only but the juice. Sometimes his wary steps, but wandring too Would carry him the Christal Mountains to Where Nature locks her Gems, each costly spark Mocking the Stars, spher'd in their Cloisters dark. Sometimes the Hough, anon the Gardners Spade He deign'd to use, and tools of th'Chymick trade. His fruit of Toyl Hermetically done Stream to the poor as light doth from the Sun. The lavish Garb of silks, Rich Plush and Rings Physitians Livery, at his feet he flings. One hand the Bellows hold, by t'other Coals Disposes he to hatch the health of Souls; Which Mysteries this Chiron was more wise Then unto ideots to Anatomize. But in a second person hopes I have His Art will live though he possess the Grave. To treat the MORALS of this Healer Luke Were to essay to write a PENTATUKE, Since all the Law as to the MORAL part Had its impression in his spotless heart: The vertues shining brightest in his Crown Were self depression, scorning all renown; Meekness and Justice were together laid When any Subject from good order straid. Neither did ever Artificial fire Boyle up the Choler of his temper higher Then modest bounds. In Church and Common-wealth Who was the Balsome of his Countries Health. Europe sure knew his worth who fixt his Name Among its glorious Stars of present fame. Here Royal CHARLES leads up, stands WINTHROPE there Amongst the Virtuosi in the Rear: But for his Art with hundreds of the rest He might be plac'd in Front and come a Breast. What Soul in fouldings t'other side the Screne With Souls turn'd Angels guess we to have been When first his Chariot wheels the threshold felt Where WINTHROPS, DUDLYS, COTTONS Spirits dwelt? What melting joys are there? Sorrows below, Should adequately from New-England flow: If Saints be intercessors, heres our hope We need not be beholding to the Pope. We have as good our selves, an honest Brother Outvies their Saintship, there or any other. Now Helmonts lines so learned and abstruse Are laid aside and quite cast out of use: And Authors which such vast expenses spent Lye like his Corpse; his Ear is only lent To Heavenly Harmonies, all things his Eye Views in the platforme whence all forms did fly; His labours cease for ever, but the fruit He reaps at Fountain head without dispute. B. Thompson. UPON The elaborate Survey of New-Englands Passions from the NATIVES By the impartial Pen of that worthy Divine Mr. WILLIAM HUBBARD. A Countreys Thanks with Garlands ready lye To wreathe the Brows of your Divinity Renowned Sir: to write the Churches Warre In ancient times fell to the Prophets share New-Englands Chronicles are to be had From Nathans Pen, or Manuscript of Gad. Purchase wrote much, Hacluyt traversed farr, Smith and Dutch John de Laet famous are, Martyr, with learn'd Acosta thousands too, Here's noveltyes and stile which all out-doe, Wrote by exacter hand then ever took Historians Pen since Europe wee forsooke. I took your Muse for old Columbus Ghost, Who scrapt acquaintance with this western Coast, But in converse some pages I might find Then all Columbus Gemms a brighter mind. Former Adventures did at best beguile About these Natives Rise (obscure as Nile) Their grand Apostle writes of their return; Williams their Language; Hubbard how they burn, Rob, kill and Roast, lead Captive, flay, blaspheme; Of English valour too he makes his Theme, Whose tragical account may Christned be New-Englands Travels through the bloudy Sea. Drake gat renown by creeping round the old; To treat of this New World our Author's bold. Names uncouth which ne'r Minshew could reduce By's Polyglotton to the vulgar use. Unheard of places like some New-Atlantis, Before in fancy only, now Newlandis: New found and subtle Stratagems of Warre, We can quaint Elton and brave Barriffe spare: New Discipline and Charges of Command Are cloath'd in Indian by this English hand. Moxon who drew two Globes, or whosoere Must make a third, or else the old ones tear, To find a Roome for thy new Map by which Thy friends and Country all thou dost enrich. Gratitudinis ergò apposuit B. T. The Reverend man of God Mr. Peter Hubbard Pastor of Hingam church his translation or ????????? 23: 11: 1678. Deepe Hubbard, next Religious awe to thine Is due, what men allow Virtues Divine. I in remembrance of thy name essayd A first and second time but was afraid: Too big for my poore shell to Comprehend Where to begin or where to make an end. Nor Could an Ephod cut by humane witt This Aaron's gravity compleatly fitt. I could not trace so deepe and spacious stream Up to Its head, the name's sufficient Theame Of such antiquity beyond sea knowne By persecutions from an Eden blowne Into a milder clime, yet even there From Truth-Professing friends hee had his share. Yet like a Marble pelted by the waves Hee kept his soundness where some found their graves. alone with truth on's side Than by whole Synods to bee dignified. The common places of Divines desert Perfection in the tongues: brave skill in Art May here adapted bee, for at his Grave Their excellencies they divested have. His trade was Jewells: which hee fetcht above: All his Returnes, Faith, Currant prayers and love. Mans full allowance, threescore years and Ten Spent most in pulpit toyles this man of men honour to supply the needs Of his great Charge, without the Reverend weeds Of purest Lawne, which else might well become This sufferer in his petty Martyrdome. His words were Oracles his fervent prayers Like mighty Angels climbd the Heavnly stairs Bat'red heavns Frontiers, entred and Came back With all the blessings which the Church did lack. His life was Gospel copied out by line, Exactness best becomes the best Divine. His Doctrine plaine, yet pungent: free but pure, Whose efficacy could both kill and Cure. This Abram kept his bosom Opend Wide As Jesus armes for babes which some deny'd. What many pray for only, not indeav'or, Christs Kingdom's growth hee durst not would not sever. Infants unborne may well lament his Death Who saincted all when first they drew their breath Barring those Temples, least the World or sin Or Hells great Champion should enter in. Zeale to the Levits work, the vineyards call Moved him pay more than tithes of sons nigh all Greate Benefactor to the Learned sort This Western World hath cause to bless him for't. Before this heavnly Hydra Feels his fate Four heads of the old stock doe Germinate, True Issue of his braines and Learned loynes By grace and practise both, Lively Divines. The Vesper of his life's a constant Cry: When will deaths curious claws these knots untie? A crazie cage of bones curtaind with Skin A Ruind Castle where great strength had beene. A Blaze of Heavn A beame Divine, A mind Of the first Magnitude some time Confin'd. When Aarons Tabernacle work is done Hee strips his Vestures to adorne his Son Thus hee uncased himselfe: Resignes the Keys With (Nunc dimittis) finishing his days. The travells of almost a double age Hoary with toyle, and time thus quitts the stage. Heavns Charioteers, hence with an unseene traine Up in great Honour Convoy him to Reigne. And what remains imbalmd in Teares is dust Not lost but sowne: A Treasure put in trust: Layd at the Churches doore, Just by the side Of Saincts, which were his sparkling Crowne, and pride. That at his death as well as life hee might Declare the Church to bee his great Delight. Rest then thy weary bones Thou man of God If ere the Church fall out assume the Rod Or rather let the Reverence of thy Name Bee tutelary Angel of the same And When thy darksom Cell yee saincts pass by Say there, the Glorie of His Coat doth lie. B. T. Dignum laude Virum Musa Vetat mori. New-Englands grand Eclips by the withdrawing of that vast body, or Trium-virate of Politick, Ecclesiastick, Military Light John Leverett Governour of the Massathuset, and Moderatour of the Confederate Colonies In New England, who disbanded the 16th: of the 1st: 1678/9 AEtatis suae: 63. 'Tis not a vulgar straine the Learned know Can speake the Homage which all fancies ow To this State-Giant. Had I ne're before Seen Monarchs in their Ermins rold in Gore, Had I not read on tombs, where publique trust Assures us lies the most Couragious Dust: I should have deem'd, twixt us and him this odds That Wormes like me might die But such turn Gods. I place not this Grand Heroe in their Spheare But own by such he wore his title here. Thanks first to Heaven, next to Caesar's beams Which still gives Light to pen these dolefull Theams. Hee's something worse then Monster in defect Who covers such a piece with disrespect. Heaven did not winke and chuse. Nor did the voice Of an whole Countrey once repent this Choice Form'd to this very end; sent as a Gift To help this province at a deadly lift. Lesse Active spirits might serve turn at helme While th'Vulgar like the sea is still and Calme, But for a boysterous spell, needs such an one, Who with his Countenance could quell alone. Goodness of extract happyly Conjoyn'd By heavenly Marriage to an Heroe's mind: In which if anywhere might be confest The Lion with the Lamb did feed and rest. Abràm in armes, well might th'acute Divine Make application at this wine of thine. Tall Cedars in our forrest, In whose shade Those Sympathizeing twine so long have laid Of State and Church. His valour set a spell And snib'd the outrage of the Infidell. This Holy Land was preposest before But Joshua turnd the Heathen out of Dore. And by the Soul of valour bolted out Whole Nations of the tawny barbarous rout Hee clos'd the Churches wounds and kept the peace When secret undermines did Increase. When some delv'd deep their enterprize to hide He trumpeted away their envious pride, And Cut that Gordian knot which many thought Would our Assemblys to Confusion brought. Tis more then Common vertue must stand here No vulgar Art could such a vessel steer, Whose passengers were saincts and Cabins hold Such heavenly treasure as transcendeth Gold. To keep the Arke so stedy yet not smitten. In such great Earthquakes may be truly written Among the Choicest Records: Twas a thing Whereof from Age to Age our World may ring. Next to that unseen hand which cannot Erre We may the Crown of praise on him transfer. Great were his parts, Sublimer much his grace Some beams of Majesty had toucht his face Sufficient to enforme a Countrey whence He borrow'd his Magestick Influence. A Generall of such a noble sphear His person and his purse both scorn'd the Reare. So amiable both in Court and Field His hand could Conquer while his spirits yield. Come fellow souldiers: Chere all hearts amain The Countreys cordiall is Soveraigne He Honourably cry'd up all the Joy When Boston Eccho'd loud Vive le Roy Tis plaine without him we had had no sence What meant the things call'd Royall Influence. Twas not pure Custome but an anuall debt Which caus'd our Alma Mater humbly set Great Leveretts name, maine patron of her rights In publique acts after their studious nights A Thesis of it self so full of light All disputations were decided by't. He left that Marble which before was Stone Or rather that Created which was none. A great worke built on ruines former fame Yet but an urne compar'd with his great name. Next that Grand matron, creep the Infant schools Which save some naturall wits from greatest fools Drest in the weeds of grief: And well they may Since their Maecaenas is divorc'd away. The Regiments, professours of the time Lament in Ranke and file though not in Rhime. All quarters startled at the suddaine end Of this brave Joshua their publique friend. Bring floods of tears, yet some returnd as though The numerous already would not off. Whose big swoln Clouds are ready to disperse Their Amber tears upon the Sable herse This Providence hath baffled all that Art Which to the World did heav'n's concerns impart. Such who the most by starrs and tide did know Could not portend this full sea of our woe. By this prodigious stroke of Cruell fate Which our Eclypses Scheme doth Antidate, Who setting in our Clime has great Remarke And proves Star-prophets sometimes in the darke. Good Reason too Wise men are patent free And ruld great Starrs themselves and thus did hee. When angells made a muster in the Skie And their stupendous ordinance let flie, Ers while what could their Loud report portend But preparations for this Generals end. That spacious field was cleard of that black Guard To Convoy this up to his high reward. Such as New Englands Annalls mind to sift Will find him by quotation. John the fifth: alias sixth But I recede from this Illustrious Throne Whither my phancy roves to make my moane Poor broken Boston, shall thy bleared eyes And dolefull sighs which dayly stab the Skies Griefs Hurricanes, what shall they never o're And force their entry at some other dore? Must this darke Climate be the onely stage For Nemesis to act her various rage? This the Aceldama for wounds and gore The publick hospitall for pox and poor? And must that man of sin who plots our woe And Heav'ns dishonour, always Scotfree goe? Shall the Laviathan who feasts on states And quaffs the blood of Kings escape the fates? Lord cast some Angry sparke into the nest Of that blood sucking Anti Christian beast. What yet remains New England's out of view To pilate in such storms adventure few. All Caesars subjects with a Common voyce Cry God save Charles and help you in next choyce. His diadem which now is soild with tears So that her Lustre something disappears. Sole Cordiall in his paines, which by his limbs In a deep Gulf of tears before you swims Whilst this small province in its freedom stands Honour the dead by lending liveing hands This will be omen of your future peace Heaven will Create or rayse up more of these. B. T. Upon the very Reverend SAMUEL WHITING. MOunt Fame, the glorious Chariot of the Sun; Through the World's Cirque, all you, her Herald's, run: And let this Great Saint's Merits be reveal'd, Which, during Life, he studiously conceal'd. Cite all the Levites, fetch the Sons of Art, In these our Dolours to sustain a part. Warn all that value Worth, and every one Within their Eyes to bring an Helicon. For in this single Person we have lost More Riches, than an India has engrost. When Wilson, that Plerophory of Love, Did from our Banks, up to his Center move, Rare Whiting quotes Columbus on this Coast, Producing Gems, of which a King might boast. More splendid far than ever Aaron wore, Within his Breast, this Sacred Father bore. Sound Doctrine Urim, in his Holy Cell, And all Perfections Thummim there did dwell. His Holy Vesture was his Innocence, His Speech, Embroideries of curious Sence. Such awful Gravity this Doctor us'd, As if an Angel every Word infus'd. No Turgent Stile, but Asiatic Store; Conduits were almost full, seldom run o're The Banks of Time: Come Visit when you will, The Streams of Nectar were descending still: Much like Septemfluous Nilus, rising so, He watered Christians round, and made them grow. His modest Whispers could the Conscience reach, As well as Whirlwinds, which some others preach; No Boanerges, yet could touch the Heart, And clench his Doctrine by the meekest Art. His Learning and his Language, might become A Province not inferiour to Rome. Glorious was Europe's Heaven, when such as these Stars of his Size, shone in each Diocess. Who writ'st the Fathers Lives, either make Room, Or with his Name begin your Second Tome. Ag'd Polycarp, Deep Origen, and such Whose Worth your Quills; your Wits not them, enrich; Lactantius, Cyprian, Basil too the Great, Quaint Jerom, Austin of the foremost Seat, With Ambrose, and more of the Highest Class, In CHRIST's great School, with Honour, I let pass; And humbly pay my Debt to Whiting's Ghost, Of whom both Englands, may with Reason boast. Nations for Men of Lesser Worth have strove, To have the Fame, and, in Transports of Love, Built Temples, or fix'd Statues of pure Gold, And their vast Worth to After-Ages told. His Modesty forbad so fair a Tomb, Who in Ten Thousand Hearts obtain'd a Room. What sweet Composures in his Angels Face! What soft Affections, Melting Gleams of Grace! How mildly pleasant! By his closed Lips, Rhetoricks Bright Body suffers an Eclipse. Should half his Sentences be truly Numbred, And weigh'd in Wisdom's Scales, 'twould spoil a Lombard: And Churches Homilies, but Homily be, If Venerable WHITING, set by thee. Profoundest Judgment, with a Meekness rare, Preferr'd him to the Moderator's Chair; Where like Truth's Champion, with his piercing Eye, He silenc'd Errors, and made Hectors fly. Soft Answers quell hot Passions; ne'er too soft Where solid Judgment is enthron'd aloft. Church Doctors are my Witnesses, that here Affections always kept their proper Sphere, Without those Wilder Eccentricities, Which spot the fairest Fields of Men most Wise. In pleasant Places fall that Peoples Line, Who have but Shadows of Men thus Divine. Much more their Presence, and Heaven pierceing Prayers, Thus many Years, to mind our Soul-Affairs. A poorest Soil oft has the Richest Mine; This Weighty Oar, poor Lyn was lately thine. O Wondrous Mercy! But this Glorious Light Hath left thee in the Terrors of the Night. New England, didst thou know this Mighty One. His Weight and Worth, thou'dst think thy self undone: One of thy Golden Chariots, which among The Clergy, render'd thee a Thousand strong: One, who for Learning, Wisdom, Grace, and Years, Among the Levites hath not many Peers: One, yet with God a Kind of Heavenly Band, Who did whole Regiments of Woes withstand: One, that prevail'd with Heaven; One greatly mist On Earth; he gain'd of Christ whate'er he list: One of a World; who was both born and bred At Wisdom's Feet, hard by the Fountain's Head. The Loss of such an One, would fetch a Tear, From Niobe her self if she were here. What qualifies our Grief, centers in This, Be our Loss near so Great, the Gain is his. B. Thompson. A short memoriall and Revew of sum Vertues in that examplary Christian, Mary Tompson, who Dyed in march 22: 1679. penned for the imitation of the liveing. Of all the treasure which this world doth hould Tru saints are best whose price transendeth gould And of all Comforts which Concern this life, None to be found like to a Vertuous wife. Our proto parent was environd round With Rarest things yet no Content he found Till such an one was formed by his side With whom he might Convers, in whom Confide With out which Comfort all our sweets are sowers And familyes bear thissels with out floures. And here if any whear it may be said Lyes the Content of her lamenting head, His Dearest Choice his Credit and his Crown, A sweet example to a Christian Town, Whose life was made of innocence and love, Whose Death doth all to great Compasion move. Tis hard to tell where love did beare such sway, Who twas Commanded or who did obey. The swetest titles ever past betwene, A Christian paire and Deeds might here be seen. A Choicer spirit hardly Could be found For Universall virtue on the ground. One who betimes gave Up her virgin heart, To Christ with solemn vows never to part, And when she Changd her state she did attend Such Dutyes as Concernd the maryage end. With lovely Clusters Round on every side, The house of god and hers she butified. Zeal to whose worship in her Constant ways Makes her an object of transendant prays. What entercourse twixt heav'n and her I guess, Besides what others did to me Confess, Makes me Enrole her Reall saint indeed For whom her turtle may both weep and bleed. Ask but the neighbour hood and they will tell, She was a Dorcas in our israell, Ready on every hand to run or spend To sick and pore to minister and lend. So amiable in her whole Convers, The least we Can is to lament her hearse. But twas a stock in hand only on trust Which to Returne upon Demand is just. Our intrest houlds no longer, heavens decree, Must give a supersedeas unto the. Her wedded Consort from those bitter sighs She is above a mortall that ner dyes. Tis tru she might have lived many a year, And still have shone in her Domestick sphear. She might have made your lovely number up, And you a while adjournd that bitter Cup. You might have livd both long and sweet as ever, Yet in the end the sword of Death must sever. The faster love is twisted in the heart With Roots Confirmd the harder tis to part. She might have pind a way with tedious mone But her Dispatch is quick, shees quickly gone. Two lives in one panting foe, Double breath She yeilds up both in to the arms of Death. Well may our teares at such a loss run ore When such as love most Dear must se no more. Well may her Consort Call this marys Day, Deaths bitterness hath swept his joys a way, But lett in hers at once or lett her in Such Chambers where never entered sin. No Tears or pains, nor what brings Cross or wo The Climate where she is shall ever know. Should soule and body both posess one grave, Relations then Could small Refreshment have, While we discharg poore dutys to the Dust, Her soule triumphant is among the just. Could heven one glimps of passion once retaine, Sheed Chide those teares off, and make you refrain. Now all her prayers and hopes are spedd, Her memory survives her body Dead. Let her example as a Coppy stand To Childrens Children upon every hand. Talk of her sayings, one to another tell, What in her life you have observed well. Follow her steps and imitate her life, Who was a Virtuous virgin mother wife. So when Deaths summons treats you in such wise, You may with greatest Comfort, Close your eys. B. T. A Short but Sorrowfull memoriall of my dear Sister Sarah Tompson who entered into glory 15th: 11th. 1679: AEtatis Suae 43: Penned plainly for the bereaved childrens use and relations Comfort. If ever Soule found glorios Land I'll venture To Say her Soule most cleere and pure did enter Which though by natures filthyness once stain'd It hath more than its former beauty gain'd Being rinsed in that fount whereby Saints bee From filth and Guilt, from fault and charg made free Tis more than meere Relation that Invites This testimony of her worth who writes Twice seven years knowledge bids mee speak the truth She serv'd her Jesus from her tender youth When others were on bed and dropt asleep She to her Saviour oft sate up to weep She heard, she read, confest, she fasted, pray'd In public and secret and what els is said Beseeming real Saints shee said and did But still with a design of being hid An hid one during life of rarest worth And now or never's time to blaze it forth For others pattern: Well it may be said He that obtains a wife like this is made. Speak of her virgin mother maid or wife She Acted Christian always to the life. She was a beautious precious crown indeed Whose soules translation makes her consort bleed The sweetest fittest Consort could be found For his Affection on New-Englands ground One that knew when to Spend and when to Spare One that knew how to Speake when to forbeare One in whose heart chast modestie did reighn That could be angry yet in time refraine What diligence and prudent ways she had To make her Chickens round about her glad By feeding cloathing giving each theyr part And ordering her household by an Art Not common: But in her Example true And imitable but by very few.

His heart was erst inamourd with delights In studious Solitudes, in Attick Nights To prove the greatest avarice of his minde After the Gems of Skill his Body pin'd. Hating the sluggards bed, and flattering sloth, Nocturnal Wakes had brought him to vast growth. His tender years were seasoned with a Juice, Which might have provd, if spar'd, of gen'ral use. He clim'd the Shrowds of Science: Now hees dead, Hees got above the verry topmost head, Hearing that word which set his Soul on fire With blazing zeal of Love: Brite Soul, come higher, All that thou see'st is thine, myself to boot; Heres an Eternal feast of Love: fall to it. High, we believe, this welcome Guest was seated, And in an instant all his joys compleated. EPITAPH. THE World was once in danger to drop out Sidney's Remains, Wits universe about.

Wave upon wave; Blows fall so thicke, so fast, Arterial blood, I fear, will come at last Instead of tears; Methinks I feel the smart, Which in this hour of tryal cramps your heart. A spouses Death, so wise, so Chast, so fair, Would bring a Job himselfe next Door Despair: Soon after that, the First fruits of your strength; I fear your patience will you fail at length.

Transcendent Sir, Your Stamp is royal; Your Commissions Rays From loyal Hearts demand loud Thanks, high Praise. Our Senators with publick Cares so tir'd, With chearfullness resign to you desird. Accept a poor Mans Thanks, a rural Bitt, E're you arrive the Festivalls of Witt. The Traveller where Wine's not to be had, With a Cup of cold Water's often glad. Since Harvards Libertys we fear are lost, And Hasty-Pudding's Servd in stead of roast. I've seen some feasted and placd in the Chair And treated as I thought with Treatment rare: But what was in the Pot he who this writ, Tasting not once thereof, Still turnd the Spit. We hope your Grandeur, for whom all have prayd, Shall never lack our Love, our Purse, our Aid. We bless our King; we thank the Waves and Wind, That to our Sinking State have been So kind: To land your Person, Ship'd by Grace of God. Our loyal Hearts bespeak your long Abode.

Fam'd Agawam, who once drew salem Fair Sure prophecyd this Interview so rare. So what in jest with his Sharp Awl he wrote Is in good Earnest to our Quarters brought. Mountains bare-headed Stand; Each fertile Field, When washd with Showers will rich presents yield. Adopt this People as we ready be; An Eden So long hid you'll quickly See. Deep Mines their Riches tender; Gardens Flowers; Their Sprawling Vines Stretch out to make you Bowers. Charles River Swoln with Joys, o'er flows with Thanks: And Sends his golden Trouts up winding Banks. Old Merimack was ne'er So glad before: And casts up Salmon free cost on the Shore. Deep Conges drop the Elm; tall Cedars bow- And Corydon to gaze deserts the Plough. Damoetas his Nown Self, had hither rid, But that he's run with Speed to fetch a Kid. To make this Country Treat more Solemn up Brisk Thesiylis comes panting with a Cup Of dainty Syllabub: Sweet Amaryllis Her Flask replete with Rose and Daffodyl.

Brisk sons of Mars, Valours right Heirs, all round, Your modest Arms this Day are richly crownd. A General you have from Europe blown Whose very Sight might make Quebeck your own Although With Wrinkled Age my Colours furld, Under his Conduct we'd soon storm that World. Pardon, fair Sir, that many Thousand Meet To lay a Province' Welcomes at your Feet. A City Treaty for your Worth remains By Potent Purses and more Powerfull Brains.

Thompson. The Illustrious Fitz-John Winthrop Esquire— Governor of Quinecticott Colony in New England Memorized and lamented by an aged Sylvan of the Massathusets Anno Dom: 1708. Winthrop this day repos'd his weary bones Leaving his Province filld with equall groans To those which by the wrack hee under-went Ere his brave soul was from its binding rent. Being the third of a Renowned line Which wee Americans deemd next Divine The last Gazet which from New-England came Might ha' been crowned with GREAT WINTHROPs name. Advertisment Enough to fill a page And deluge with its tears the present age. His grandsire by direction of a starre Conducted all our Tribes hither, thus farr And many thousands of most precious Ore And SAINTS more precious landed here on shoare Laying the Platforme of his State so firme No underminers in his life did harme. Winthrop, the second, of renowned fame Hath filld this climate with his perfumd name. CHARLES that hee might his grand Arcanas know While hee prepard them would the bellows blow. Were there a Balsom, which all wounds could cure Twas in this Asculapian hand be sure. WINTHROP, the third with palsied hand I write His Province pillar, and this lands delight. His auncient Patent while hee livd was free From all intrusions on their libertie. While all the neighbourhood was set on fire Hee kept his Paradisian hearts desire, Being garrisond with GOD, all fencd about With living walls, and hearts of Marble stout. New-England Histories so much have said In WINTHROPS praise, poor I do but degrade. Europe knows better than wee natives tell How in thy Parentage thou didst excell. Vertues sufficient to oblige a World Have at thy Exit all their streamers furld. In Boston lies the timber of the ARKe On which before hees borne hee did imbarque Winthrop the first Lord of the Americk coast Opning his bosom of his sons may boast In lethall agonies, this, prays for rest Upon the pillow of that auncient breast. Lands every where hee had wheron to lie Yet hee must see his grandsires tomb and die. By a great favorite hees upward handed Sin and Temptations all at once disbanded Hee at the Innes of Court such treaty finds As fully can content ingenuous minds Heers three great Winthrops under whom wee thrivd Wee hope the fourth will prove far longer lived. And such as are invested with great power May bee preparing for a parting hour. Epilogi vice— Thus naked Sylvans, guiltless as to Art Yet in our sorrows need not learne our part, Since wee can mourn, with all our Vitals black When those are rent from us wee chiefly lack. Not to renew your sorrows this I write Not to prevent your surfeits in delight Accept this offering of a countrey teare From clouded eys that soon must disappeare Might I with such kind Enterteinment have Take lands who will, I would request a Grave.

O heighth! o Depthe! upon my bended knees Who dare Expound these Wondrous Mysteries: That this rare plant is cropt before mine Eyes (Meer Shadow) left to write her Elegies. Pray what brave Artist here can Understand What one intends that takes a pen in hand? Twas t'other day a place I visited Where stands a palme, one limb where of is dead. A bow'r which many years Thousands have shaded By whome one Church was built: and Willard aided Seeking the plat of Immortality I saw no place secure but some must die Treading that way their Ancient fathers did Whose faces are, but Vertues can't be hid. I saw this pretty Lamb, but t'other day, With a small flock of Doves, Just in my Way. What New made Creature's this so bright 'thought I Ah! pitty tis such prettiness should die. With rare alliances on Every side Had old physitians liv'd She ne're had died. Must then the Rulers of this Worlds Affairs By Providence be brought to us in tears. Lord keep their Eyes from such smart Judgments free Such mournfull Sights are more becoming mee. Pleasant Rebecka, heres to thee a Tear Hugg my sweet Mary if you chance to see her Had you giv'n warning ere you pleasd to Die, You might have had a neater Elegy. Ben: Thompson. A Clowde of Tears, sprinkled on the Dust of the Amiable Virgin Mrs. Rebecka Sewel who Suddenly died August. 3 1710. AEtatis suae 6. Heav'ns only, in dark hours Succours can send And Shew a fountaine where the streams do End. Behold the Lamb of God (mourners) for there's Your pretty Lamb which you bewaile in tears. She is Enfolded, in her Shepards Armes Hugg'd in a Bosom, full of Heavenly Charmes. Nothing could Ravish her from your Embrace But the trancendancy of her Saviours face. She was so lovely in her Makers Sight Sweet Virgins may wee Stile his hearts Delight. The Wisest King in his Magnificence Kept Virgins Numberless without Offence Shining like Starrs, his faire pavillion round With heavenly rays of fairest graces crown'd. The honours he conferd were pitteous things Set by the favours of the King of Kings The least Donations by him to be told Are Kings with Carbuncles and Chains of Gold. Purples and Sattins there are all cast by And all are clad with Little Majesty. Great Jesus claimd his owne, Never begrutch Your Jewels rare into the hands of Such. He with his Righteousness hath finer drest Your Babe than ere you did, when at your Breast. Madam, 'tis not your case alone, for thousands have Follow'd their sweetest comforts to the Grave. Theres no Withstanding fixed Destiny Which will prevaile who ever live or Die. Death that Stern Officer takes no Denyall I'm grievd he found your Door to make a Tryall: And bee it on the Shoar or swelling Seas His boundless Sovereignty doth what he please. It is a lesson hard (I must confess) For our proud Wills with heav'ns to Acquiesce. But when Death goes before; Unseen behind Theres Such an one as may compose the mind Pray Madam, wipe those tears from your fair Eyes And with your New made Virgin Sympathize. Could she from her new School obtain but leave Shee'd tell you what would make you cease to grieve And Wipe those Briny Streams all off your face Leaving your loving smiles upon the place. This Suddain Providence my hand did move To two great familys to show my love Like a poor mason to prepare a Room On Earth for one, who finds in Heaven a home.

HEav'ns only, in dark hours, can Succour send; And shew a Fountain, where the cisterns end. I saw this little One but t'other day With a small flock of Doves, just in my way: What New-made Creature's this so bright? thought I Ah! Pity 'tis such Prettiness should die. Madam, behold the Lamb of GOD; for there's Your Pretty Lamb, while you dissolve in Tears; She lies infolded in her Shepherd's Arms, Whose Bosom's always full of gracious Charms. Great JESUS claim'd his own; never begrutch Your Jewels rare into the Hands of Such. He, with His Righteousness, has better dress'd Your Babe, than e're you did, when at your breast. 'Tis not your case alone: for thousands have Follow'd their sweetest Comforts to the Grave. Seeking the Plat of Immortality, I saw no Place Secure; but all must dy. Death, that stern Officer, takes no denial; I'm griev'd he found your door, to make a trial. Thus, be it on the Land, or Swelling Seas, His Sov'raignty doth what His Wisdom please. Must then the Rulers of this World's affairs, By Providence be brought thus into Tears? It is a Lesson hard, I must confess, For our Proud Wills with Heav'ns to acquiesce. But when Death goes before; Unseen, behind There's such a One, as may compose the Mind. Pray, Madam, wipe the tears off your fair eyes; With your translated Damsel Sympathise: Could She, from her New School, obtain the leave, She'd tell you Things would make you cease to grieve. B. T. The Translation by death, of that Holy Man of God, Reverend Mr. JAMES ALLEN, a very Learned, Faithful, Painful Pastor of the First Church of Christ in Boston. Who Expired, September 22d, 1710. Aged 78. FAme, trim thy Wings, call nimble Mercury To Arimathaea hence in haste both fly; Enquire there for a dextrous Lapicide. Josephs Acquaintance, by him known and try'd. Who fram'd our Saviours Sepulchre tell him He should unlock the same: for here's a Lamb Which to that Blessed Body appertains, That in the Mount of Highest Glory reigns. Or from pure Alabaster, hew a Tomb, And for this PURITAN, polish a Room. Fetch Spices from the Aromatic East, Fill up the vacant corners of the Nest Of this rare Phoenix, whose disease was Age, Who merited a most transcendent Page. Having Perfum'd the Church with precious Pray'r And by sound Doctrine Clarify'd the Air. Avoiding florid strains, he dived deep, One Eye to Heaven, one on the Text he'd keep. Altho' his Meditations were profound, His Hearers never saw him run a-ground. Our Living Orthodox with Allen joyn'd Brighter than Gemini in Boston shin'd. When first it was my lot his face to see, I fancied PAUL talking with TIMOTHY. Grave Cotton had he been that day commanded Into his Pulpit would them both have handed. I dare not give the World his Character, Who am my self too incident to Err. It's Angels work to write Seraphims praise, Vertues Divine should be pourtray'd with Rays. But if the Pictures of our Saviour might Be worshiped, here's one laid out of sight. Ah could I like him pray, and get my will, I would have wrote with a Seraphick Quill. Such is the end of a Laborious Bee, And glad am I such rare Successors see. Jesus to Allen was his All in All, He never on that Name did vainly call. Jesus in all his Sermons he proclaim'd, Who rarely is in many Volumns Nam'd. The Hearts of Thousands have his Name engrav'd Who by him as Christ's Instrument are sav'd. The ancient Saints hearing their Pastor's come, Old Anthony his friend, cries pray make room. But when his faithful Master he found out, No less than JESUS Claspeth him about. And for his Faithfulness brings him a Crown, That would all Earthly Diadems weigh down. Let all my Angels witness what I do, My faithful Labourers in my Service too. He's not the first, pray mind your work below, I can and will on you such Honour show. October. 2d. 1710 B. T.

The height of heavenly love no soule can know Till Death disects the knots of flesh below. Above the sunn, beyond the orbs of light Is built a Cyty filld with all delight Where no less person then the son of god Our light, our life, Saints king makes his abode Here in a pallace heavens fair nunnerye Chast virgins have faire entertainment free And such as sought his favour upon earth: Enjoy their purest love in sacred mirth. Great Jesus daily steps off his bright throne And gives them hart embraces every one He lovd me, me, when I was but very young And seated me his virgin tribes among. I Dare not tell what here in hart i find All tho i left most Christian friends behind. Christ lovd me in my short morning dawn, With Cords of love he hath me upward drawn. All wedding ornaments he for me hath made And me unworthy in his bosom laid. Dear parents for your prayers i Dayly prais Who nurtured me so well in early days Religious tutors give a blessed lift To infant souls while millions Run adrift. Clouded with teares where mourning Clouds I see I made short use in this apostrophe. A lovely Cluster on a vine i saw, So faire it did my admiracion draw, Climbing the sun side of an house of prayer, And solaceing it selfe in heavenly aire Yet sudenly upon an eastward blast The beuty of his boughs was over cast The fairest grapes were pickt off one by one. The Dresser looking like one half undone Thers no undoing while a saviour lives Who takes no more then what he lends or gives. Three manly sons grown up to Comly size, Two Daughters apples in theire parents eyes, Pickt out by envious Death, with us remains Their precious Dust abhorring sin or staine. What importunity in prayer could reach, Was handed down in showers from heaven on each Proximity of blood makes me for beare All Round her prais her while i Drop this tear. All Comendations Could befall a maid A tribute to her memory might be paid A solitary sigh. So many lashes from a fathers hand Make providences hard to understand Why this befalls the Righteus man, but the Great sinner left to wright her Elegy. While you in biternes of soule thuss mourn Pray for youre sinking onely brothers turn. I hope you've learned the art of selfe deniall When faith is active pacients beares the triall. Keep in the use of such Angellic graces, Twill make you Cherefull, till you se their faces. Your streams of grief when you are perchd above Will all be swallowed up in th' abyss of love Amazing love o what a sight is here Where jesus raigns and every saint appear. Such as on earth their virgin love exprest With hyest potentates Com here abreast How ever there i was but mean and low. My love hath Clothed mee from top to toe My hart had faild me in the milkie way Had i not his right hand where on to stay; Who led me to the mount of pleasures top Where i all flowers of paradice do Crop. Pray in this lodgeing where i find sweet Rest, Let not your sighs nor groans mine ears molest. Sweet mother close mine eys and turn aside My Jesus sends for me, Thus said she dyed. By my Dearest Brother Benjamin Tompson. The following Verses were made by Mr. Benjamin Tompson Roxbury June 20th. 1713. being some of his last lines. I feel this World too mean, and low. Patron's a lie: Friendship a Show Preferment trouble: Grandure Vaine Law a pretence: a Bubble Gaine Merit a flash: a Blaze Esteem Promise a Rush: and Hope a Dream Faith a Disguise: a Truth Deceit Wealth but a Trap: and Health a Cheat These dangerous Rocks, Lord help me Shun Age tells me my Days work is done.</field>

ABRA'MS true Son for Faith; and in his Tent Angels oft had their Table and Content. So Humble, that alike on's Charity, Wrought Extract Gent: with Extract Rudi.
