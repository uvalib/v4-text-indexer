      <field name="fulltext">[Job, good and just, in Uz had sojourned long] “Job, good and just, in Uz had sojourned long, He feared his God and shunned the way of wrong. Three were his daughters, and his sons were seven, And large the wealth bestowed on him by heaven. Seven thousand sheep were in his pastures fed, Three thousand camels by his train were led; For him the yoke a thousand oxen wore, Five hundred she asses his burdens bore. His household to a mighty host increased, The greatest man was Job in all the East.” [How awfully sublime and grand to see] “How awfully sublime and grand to see, The lamp of Day wrap'ed in Obscurity. To see the sun remove behind the moon, And nightly darkness shroud the day at noon; The birds no longer feel his genial ray, But cease to sing and sit upon the spray. A solemn gloom and stillness spreads around, Reigns in the air and broods o'er all the ground. Once-smiling Nature wears another face, The blooming meadow loses half its grace. All things are silent save the chilling breeze, That in low whispers rustles through the trees. The stars break forth and stud the azure sky, And larger planets meet the wondering eye. Now busy man leaves off his toil to gaze, And some are struck with horror and amaze, Others of noble feelings more refin'd Serenely view it with a tranquil mind. See God's bright image strikingly portrayed In each appearance which his power had made. (Fixed in their hearts cool Meditation sate, With uprais'd eye and thoughtful look sedate.) Now burst the Sun from silence and from night, Though few his beams, they shed a welcome light; And Nature's choir, enlivened by his rays, Harmonious warble their Creator's praise. The shades of darkness feel his potent ray, Mine eye pursue them as they flee away; [The word is given, the cruel arrow flies] “The word is given, the cruel arrow flies With death-foreboding aim, and Woodbridge dies. Lo! Hampshire's genius, bending o'er his bier, In silent sorrow heaves the sigh sincere; Loose to the wind her hair dishevelled flies And falling tear-drops glisten in her eyes.” [So seemed the Cretan labyrinth of old] So seemed the Cretan labyrinth of old, Maze within maze, in many a winding fold. Deep in those convoluted paths in vain The wretched captive sought the day again, But, lost and wearied with the devious way, Fell to the monster bull a helpless prey Till Ariadne lent the guiding thread That back to life the Athenian hero led. Thus, round and round, with intricate design, These snaky walks in endless mystery twine; Yet here no danger lurks, no murderous power Waits the pale victim, ready to devour. Our hands in turn bestow the friendly clue; Pursue our verse, our verse shall guide you through. [The beautiful of Israel's land lie slain] “The beautiful of Israel's land lie slain On the high places. How the mighty ones Are fallen! Tell it not in Gath, nor sound The tidings in the streets of Ascalon, Lest there the daughters of the Philistines Rejoice, lest there the heathen maidens sing The song of triumph. Oh ye mountain slopes— Ye Heights of Gilboa, let there be no rain Nor dew upon you; let no offerings smoke Upon your fields, for there the strong man's shield, The shield of Saul, was vilely cast away, As though he ne'er had been anointed king. From bloody fray, from conflict to the death, With men of might the bow of Jonathan Turned never back, nor did the sword of Saul Return without the spoils of victory. Joined in their loves and pleasant in their lives Were Saul and Jonathan; nor in their deaths Divided; swifter were they in pursuit Than eagles, and of more than lion strength. Weep, Israel's daughters! over Saul, who robed Your limbs in scarlet, adding ornaments That ye delight in, ornaments of gold. How are the mighty fallen in the heat Of battle! Oh, my brother Jonathan, Slain on the heights! My heart is wrung for thee; My brother, very pleasant hast thou been To me; thy love for me was wonderful, Passing the love of women. How are fallen The mighty, and their weapons lie in dust!” [Once more the Bard, with eager eye, reviews] “Once more the Bard, with eager eye, reviews The flowery paths of fancy, and the Muse Once more essays to trill forgotten strains, The loved amusement of his native plains. Late you beheld me treading labor's round, To guide slow oxen o'er the furrowed ground; This recalls the words of Burns's first dedication: “The poetic genius of my country found me—at the plough.” The sturdy hoe or slender rake to ply, 'Midst dust and sweat, beneath a summer sky. But now I pore o'er Virgil's glowing lines, Where, famed in war, the great Æneas shines; Where novel scenes around me seem to stand, Lo! grim Alecto whirls the flaming brand. Dire jarring tumult, death and battle rage, Fierce armies close, and daring chiefs engage; Mars thunders furious from his flying car, And hoarse-toned clarions stir the raging war. Nor with less splendor does his master-hand Paint the blue skies, the ocean, and the land; Majestic mountains rear their awful head, Fair plains extend, and bloomy vales are spread. The rugged cliff in threatening grandeur towers, And joy sports smiling in Arcadian bowers; In silent calm the expanded ocean sleeps, Or boisterous whirlwinds toss the rising deeps; Triumphant vessels o'er his rolling tide, With painted prows and gaudy streamers, glide.” THE GENIUS OF COLUMBIA. Far in the regions of the west, On throne of adamant upraised, Bright on whose polished sides impressed, The Sun's meridian splendors blazed, Columbia's Genius sat and eyed The eastern despot's dire career; And thus with independent pride, She spoke and bade the nations hear. “Go, favored son of glory, go! Thy dark aspiring aims pursue! The blast of domination blow, Earth's wide extended regions through! “Though Austria, twice subjected, own The thunders of thy conquering hand, And Tyranny erect his throne, In hapless Sweden's fallen land! “Yet know, a nation lives, whose soul Regards thee with disdainful eye; Undaunted scorns thy proud control, And dares thy swarming hordes defy; “Unshaken as their native rocks, Its hardy sons heroic rise; Prepared to meet thy fiercest shocks, Protected by the favoring skies. “Their fertile plains and woody hills, Are fanned by Freedom's purest gales! And her celestial presence fills The deepening glens and spacious vales.” She speaks; through all her listening bands A loud applauding murmur flies; Fresh valor nerves their willing hands, And lights with joy their glowing eyes! Then should Napoleon's haughty pride Wake on our shores the fierce affray; Grim Terror lowering at his side, Attendant on his furious way! With quick repulse, his baffled band Would seek the friendly shore in vain, Bright Justice lift her red right hand, And crush them on the fatal plain. W. C. B. Cummington, January 8, 1810. AD MUSAM. “So long neglectful of thy dues, And absent from thy shrine so long, Say, wilt thou deign, Immortal Muse, Again to inspire thy votary's song? The time has been when fresh as air I loved at morn the hills to climb, With dew-drenched feet and bosom bare, And ponder on the artless rhyme; And through the long laborious day (For mine has been the peasant's toil), I hummed the meditated lay, While the slow oxen turned the soil.” Worthington, January, 1812. “BROOKS'S CANADA SONG. “To Canada, Brooks was asked to go, To waste of powder a pound or so; He sighed as he answered, No, no, no, They might take my life on the way, you know. For I am afraid, afraid, afraid, Bully Brooks is afraid. “Those Jersey railroads I can't abide, 'Tis a dangerous thing in the trains to ride. Each brakeman carries a knife by his side, They'd cut my throat, and they'd cut it wide, And I am afraid, afraid, afraid, Bully Brooks is afraid. “There are savages haunting New York Bay, To murder strangers that pass that way; The Quaker Garrison keeps them in pay, And they kill at least a score a day. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid, Bully Brooks is afraid. “Beyond New York, in every car, They keep a supply of feathers and tar; They daub it on with an iron bar, And I should be smothered ere I got far. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid. Bully Brooks is afraid. “Those dreadful Yankees talk through the nose; The sound is terrible, goodness knows; And, when I hear it, a shiver goes From the crown of my head to the tips of my toes. For I am afraid, afraid, afraid, Bully Brooks is afraid. “So, dearest Mr. Burlingame, I'll stay at home, if 'tis all the same, And I'll tell the world 'twas a burning shame That we did not fight, and you're to blame. For I am afraid, afraid, afraid. Bully Brooks is afraid.” A MEMORY. “The morn hath not the glory that it wore, Nor doth the day so beautifully die, Since I can call thee to my side no more, To gaze upon the sky. “For thy dear hand, with each return of Spring, I sought in sunny nooks the flowers she gave; I seek them still, and sorrowfully bring The choicest to thy grave. “Here, where I sit alone, is sometimes heard, From the great world, a whisper of my name, Joined, haply, to some kind, commending word, By those whose praise is fame. “And then, as if I thought thou still wert nigh, I turn me, half forgetting thou art dead, To read the gentle gladness in thine eye, That once I might have read. “I turn, but see thee not; before my eyes The image of a hillside mound appears, Where all of thee that passed not to the skies Was laid with bitter tears. “And I, whose thoughts go back to happier days, That fled with thee, would gladly now resign All that the world can give of fame and praise, For one sweet look of thine. “Thus, ever, when I read of generous deeds, Such words as thou didst once delight to hear, My heart is wrung with anguish as it bleeds To think thou art not near. “And now that I can talk no more with thee Of ancient friends and days too fair to last, A bitterness blends with the memory Of all that happy past. “Oh, when I” “Roslyn, 1873.” [Corinth! proud Corinth! who, upon the verge] “Corinth! proud Corinth! who, upon the verge Of the great deep, hast made thy queenly seat! That deep thy vassal is, and every surge That strikes thy shore flings riches at thy feet.</field>
