      <field name="fulltext">POEM. I. I only sing the song we all are singing, For each man is a poet here to-day, And each a wreath of memories is bringing Upon the tomb of four dead years to lay. And as I strike my lyre to wake the feeling Which is, perhaps, unconsciously your own, I hear through all its joyous measures stealing The sad key-note in restless monotone. And this is well; for otherwise our pleasure, Now so intense, would be a senseless void: 'Tis honest work alone which finds a treasure, And sweetness is not such when unalloyed. A million years may change the hosts of Heaven, Through centuries vast nations rise and fall; But only once on earth our life is given, And in its briefness is contained our all. Then do not underestimate, my brother, The difference between the Now and Then. We came untutored boys before our Mother, She waved her wand, and lo! she finds us men. Yet let us not of Future trouble borrow; Our friends should sympathize alone with joys: To-day a thick veil hangs before To-morrow, And let us still believe that we are boys. The pleasant sun is smiling bright above us, As when we first ran through the daisied field; And in the happy eyes of those that love us Old home associations are revealed. Here in our second home about the portal A family of brothers we remain, Whose lives are one from mortal to immortal, Although we all may never meet again. For, as the tiny bodies of the coral Are nurtured by their fellows' mutual play, So we our mental sustenance, and moral, Have drawn from one another day by day. To-day both ties of family are round us; And let us linger in their dear embrace, Forgetting stern Necessity has bound us To make our home with the whole human race. II. How vividly we can recall The looks almost funereal Of those who stood four years ago Beneath the sympathetic trees Which lent their own fresh verdant glow, All ignorant of the mysteries Which each dark building might conceal And which the future would reveal. The new-fledged Soph stalked bravely by And scanned us with bloodthirsty eye, As ancient priests their victims did, Or Brighton butcher does his sheep. And then a bell rang overhead, Which, strange no more, has oft from sleep Called many an unrepentant soul Still dreaming of the flowing bowl. But, like a set of painful dreams, That long examination seems Half shrouded in forgetfulness, As all its various subjects do. For who could now correctly guess The longitude of Timbuctoo, Or translate the Anabasis, Or scan a page of Virgil through? And who could now in Mathematics Extract cube-roots or solve quadratics? Bright scenes come crowding thick and fast From out the bosom of the Past. And Memory only shows the roses, But covers o'er forgotten thorns; And reckons not of bloody noses Or battered shins or trodden corns, But only how we rushed the Soph, And hats as trophies carried off. About our rooms, which tales might tell Of madcap pranks and joys, still dwell Affectionate remembrances. And we forget the midnight grind, Forgive the goody's carelessness, And, to our chum's ill-nature blind, Think of our life as happy play, From which we sadly pass away. How pleasant in our fragile boat Upon the winding Charles to float, And watch the evening clouds grow red, And feel cool breezes round us blow, As o'er the mirrored sky we sped, Our pulsing blood with health aglow, And when the shades of night came down, Stronger and fresher, seek the town! Our crews an honorable place Have won in almost every race; And, even if the wrath divine Of river-gods o'erturn their boat, They swim with it across the line, And dripping seek the friendly float, Where laughing crowds the heroes greet, And cheer their unexpected feat. The champions of the Harvard Crew With pride among our ranks we view, Each year more celebrated grown, The giants of each summer's course. And as this year we watch the sun Flash from their quickly dipping oars, May no diagonal's deceit At Saratoga bring defeat. But other sports the warm days yield Upon the turf at Jarvis Field. Far out the anxious fielder sees A white ball quivering 'gainst the sky, And swerving sidelong with the breeze. A catch, a throw, the umpire's cry! Another victory over Yale! Nay, e'en the Boston champions fail! Forget we not the Football Club With whom McGill had quite a rub. No doubt the valiant members hold Each bruise an honorable sign They did their duty, strong and bold; And, time permitting, many a line 'Twould take to tell the charms of Cricket, The valiant contests at the wicket. Of course there never was a class Which could in scholarship surpass The record of our Seventy-four, So many on the rank-list know, So many candidates before For honors in all branches show. And none could ever boast like us A triple-headed Cerberus. A second College paper, too, Our class may boast of “putting through,” Which amicably holds its place Beside the Harvard Advocate. The Reading Room its birth must trace In future backward to our date. The French and German Clubs shall be Our gift to all posterity. But while the stalwart Gods we woo, And homage to Minerva do, The Muses we do not forsake, Euterpe and Polymnia. Sweet sounds at night the students wake; And busy voices sound afar The Harvard Glee Club's well-earned fame, The honor of Pierian's name. Ah! sweet to stand at evenfall And sing beneath the elm-trees tall, Through whose soft rustling leaves the moon Glances with melancholy beam, While the delicious air of June Turns life into a fairy dream, And in the shadows grouped around The students listen to the sound! Yet turn we from these higher themes To one which seldom comes in dreams. With us the ancient glory dies Of Commons we so well have known. No more the stinging snow-ball flies, The hats shall now be let alone, No president shall grow irate When Freshmen dodge the flying plate. And here just gliding from the shore We greet our gallant Seventy Four. Her canvas now shall be unfurled, And every port be opened wide, And to the evil of the world Defiance bidden with broadside. And ne'er her flag shall cease to wave Till all her crew are in the grave. III. Let voices be subdued within these walls Before an audience of unseen dead, Who even now perchance adown the halls Pass and repass with ever-noiseless tread, And in our faces look, and list to what is said. When life was brightest, and their years in bloom, They rushed a-field to meet their country's foes; With their own hearts shut out the impending doom, And with their blood, a price no human knows, Bought for a down-trod race immunity from woes. The nation, on whose fate the whole world hung, Faced her inevitable problem then,— The dreaded problem shunned while she was young; And in that hour she found her sons were men. They died, but in their death we all breathe free again. But by their graves in some neglected spot Their great and noble spirits could not stay. They came to see if they had been forgot; And, lo! they find yon massive Hall's array, And would inspire the class that graduates to-day. There in the shadow of the solemn tower Which stands at night with all the stars alone, 'Neath arms of oak, the symbol of that power Which great men wield who break a tyrant's throne, The visitor with awe shall scan each marble stone. No more the martial trump to battle calls; And with the fiery test we are not tried, Like those who live in yon memorials; And yet methinks there is a field as wide, Wherein we must defend the prize for which they died. The gathering storm a century ago Upon the trembling air sent signs before. Men braced themselves for the last overthrow; And all advantages we have in store We owe alone to those stout hearts of Seventy-four. Yet do not think their victory is won While still the hosts of tyranny and wrong At work beneath the dome in Washington Would drain the country's blood, which once so strong Flowed busy through her veins, and commerce whirled along. As long as sits Corruption on high thrones, And but in name the people's choice is free, And Congressmen fill offices with drones And vote themselves increased back-salary, And men the State and Church united fain would see, So long the blood of slaughtered brethren cries, So long the fathers of our land implore, “Young men, with whom her destiny now lies, Take up the arms which we have used before And stern defend the heritage we hand you o'er.” But 'mid the inspirations of the Past The freshest is of him but lately gone, For years the Ship of State's most stanch mainmast, Who fell asleep with his great victory won, America's and Harvard's loved and honored son. We saw the solemn train pass silently Which bore him to his final resting-place. And though, when we are called upon to die, We may not be thus mourned by all our race, Each leaves upon the world his everlasting trace. A little pebble falling in the sea Ruffles the ether to its outmost star. And so our influence, whate'er it be, Shall stretch into the misty Future far, And that which men shall be result from what we are. What eminence our country shall attain In culture or in useful arts or power Is ours to say; for we are like the grain Of mustard-seed, or leaven within the flour.— And the great end shall come in some unreckoned hour. We have a standard of high aim to set, A native literature to put in form, A school of art it may be to create, At least make culture and true friendship warm Our frigid worldly rules into some higher norm. Make men feel greater earnestness in life, A childlike reverence for all they see. Show the whole world with love and beauty rife. Hope well of that which is through God to be, And teach a steadfast individuality. The sea is swayed by worship of the moon. The mountains stand aghast before the storm, Or gaze upon loved valleys nestled warm Under their shoulders. Birds their sweetest tune Pour forth in praise. So let us love and sing,— For all things full of wondrous beauty are,— And reverence the lustre of a star, Be it in heaven or be it in some dear eye. So may the love of every man and thing Possess our souls, that we may not decry The meanest of God's creatures. World, thou art That mystery of which we are a part. And each event the years bring as they fly Is eloquent unto our listening heart. E'en as this earth for countless years hath rolled About the sun in orbit of her own, With independent pride and all alone, Save one sweet page that doth her sleep behold, Yet bound by laws omnipotent of old To every swinging star that studs yon zone, The centre of an influence unknown, A unit free, controlling and controlled, So is the man of great and noble deeds Bound by the gravitating force of Right, Uninfluenced by those who feel his might, Holding his own amid all thoughts and creeds, Though reverent of all, a unit still Of social force, an independent will. The years are stepping-stones by which we rise To dreamed-of regions. Like a distant peak Whose snowy top the mountaineer must seek By passing o'er the ridge that 'neath it lies, The misty Future looms before our eyes; And longing for its beauty spurs our weak, Slow steps with hope we hardly dare to speak, And soon the goal is won to our surprise. No progress on this earth was ever wrought, No grand nobility of soul was seen, Where no strong wish disturbed the course serene Of men who were contented with their lot. Hoping, we grasp the hand that God extends, And in our own complete his perfect ends. The dreamed-of Golden Age would come again, Nor stifled Virtue longer darkly grope, If we could teach our sordid countrymen Their hearts unto this Trinity to ope, Reverence, Individuality, and Hope. IV. Whene'er each business-driven dog Looks o'er the Harvard Catalogue, The papers which he finds therein Will quick recall what erst has been, And fresh before his eyes will loom His well-known recitation room, The ghosts of authors he has read, Examinations, squirt and dead. Our much-revered professors too In memory's glass we oft shall view; And Wisdom shall before us flit, Upon a mental black-board writ. Oh, had I a blue book once more, Such as we bought at Sever's store, How quick my loyal hand should fly To scribble on its page, or die! O well-proportioned polygon! O parallelopipedon! In fancy's strange prismatic light You flash again upon my sight. O tangent, secant, and cosine! We've sung your praise o'er ruby wine; And even sometimes made a note Of conjugate or asymptote. Thank Heaven! we have been taught to speak The native pure accented Greek. And those who study Latin know Rome's orator as Kikero. Farewell, old Aristophanes, Euripides and Sophocles! The upper shelf, sirs, if you please, Where you shall be allowed your ease. O horrid thoughts of Boylston Hall! My blood grows cold as I recall. A friend of mine, upon my word, Who water on some powder poured, Was driven down the stairway clean By a Phenylamylamene! The Chloropropionic there Delights, 'tis said, to make his lair. Beware the Pseudoporpurine, The Ethomethoxanodine! Come hither, pure Philosophy; Press your Platonic lips to me, And sing the transcendental strain Sweet and familiar o'er again. Far, vague, and dim, strange spirits come, With wizzled forms and faces glum. 'Tis Fichte's ghost astride the wind, With Kant and Hegel on behind! Say, dwellers with the Noumenon! Where have the Categories gone? Leaves on your memory no trace This nightmare world of Time and Space? Mighty Trichomistic seer, Unto the Absolute Idea Our best respects take back with thee, And let it be assured that we All hope it isn't kept awake With Dialectic stomach-ache. But all these forms are hid from view By History, and Physic too; And modest in the foreground is A sister troupe of Ologies. While timid Music ends the train With one low solitary strain. V. Look back upon the distant plain, From which your weary feet Have climbed the livelong day with pain. Glance o'er its pleasant groves again, And all its meadows sweet. Now, at the setting of the sun, The mountain shadows fall. Dark lines across the picture run, And all the elm-trees one by one Come out distinct and tall. Afar behold a smoky wreath Rise slowly and serene. Your ancient cottage lies beneath, And all your childish playgrounds with Their carpeting of green. I see the furrows where our plough All day we used to guide, And clearings in the forest now Where our stout arms made tall trees bow, High up the mountain side. There flows the crystal river still, In whose luxuriant flood, When through our haying on the hill, We tumbled at our own sweet will, And cooled our heated blood. Thus, comrades, stay your course awhile, And thoughtfully look back. I see upon your lips a smile, As if regardless of the toil Before you on the track. High overhead the bare peaks loom Whose summit are our goal, To Heaven so near, although a tomb To find thereon must be the doom Of each aspiring soul. Turn back, and with a tear, O friends, The map unrolled review. An added charm the distance lends, And all its features memory blends Into a picture true. Up from the ocean creeps the mist; And Night with hurrying wing Hangs out her lanterns in the East. Quick! fore the vision shall have ceased, And mark each fading thing. Farewell, dear homes of bygone years! Sweet life of youth, good-night! Your fairy land is drowned in tears. Look up! for now above appears Our only hope of light. Look up! for through the drifting night is gleaming A glory brighter than our earthly day, And all the toilsome rocks before are seeming To beauty softened in its holy ray. The bow of promise arches o'er the Heaven. Glory and Love and Duty bid us come. Bright forms there are we have not dreamed of even, Ready within our hearts to make their home. Our ways diverge, as up life's journey pressing We set our feet toward the final goal. Companions, brothers, give each other blessing, For the last time let soul commune with soul. Often shall we recall familiar faces, And on these happy years delight to dwell. But now the hour draws nigh with stealthy paces, Which bids us grasp each hand and say Farewell.</field>
