      <field name="fulltext">THAT'S THE WAY. Just a little every day— That's the way! Seeds in darkness swell and grow, Tiny blades push through the snow; Never any flower of May Leaps to blossom in a burst, Slowly, slowly, as the first, That's the way. Just a little every day. Just a little every day— That's the way, Children learn to read and write Bit by bit and mite by mite, Never any one I say Leaps to knowledge and its power; Slowly, slowly, hour by hour, That's the way! Just a little every day. BABY'S FIRST JOURNEY Lightly they hold him and lightly they sway him— Soft as a pillow are somebody's arms. Down he goes slowly, ever so lowly Over the rim of the cradle they lay him— Baby's first journey is free from alarms. Baby is growing while Mama sings by-lo, Sturdy and rosy and laughing and fair, Crowing and growing past every one's knowing, Out goes the cradle and in comes the “high-lo,” Baby's next journey is into this chair. Crying or cooing or waking or sleeping, Baby is ever a thing to adore. Look at him yonder—oh what a wonder, Who would believe it, the darling is creeping, Baby's next journey is over the floor. Sweeter and cuter and brighter and stronger, Mama can see every day how he's grown. Shoes are all battered, stockings all tattered, Oh! but the baby is baby no longer Look at the fellow—he's walking alone! WHY THE DAISIES ARE NOT ALL WHITE. Uncle Rob says: Once the daisies all were white, Till a baby fellow Ate his supper down one night, And stained his face all yellow. Smeared with butter, off to bed Crept the sleepy flower. “Fie!” the good nurse dew-drop said, Come now to my bower. “Let me wash you clean, I pray, Like the pink and rosy.” But the daisy pulled away Like a stubborn posy. All unwashed he went to sleep, Naughty little fellow. Ever since he's had to keep That great patch of yellow. So Uncle Rob says. THE POOR LITTLE TOE. I am all tired out, said the mouth, with a pout, I am all tired out with talk. Just wait, said the knee, till you're lame as you can be— And then have to walk—walk—walk. My work, said the hand, is the hardest in the land. Nay, mine is harder yet, said the brain; When you toil, said the eye, as steadily as I, O then you'll have reason to complain. Then a voice, faint and low, of the poor little toe Spoke out in the dark with a wail: It is seldom I complain, but you all will bear your pain With more patience if you hearken to my tale. I'm the youngest of five, and the others live and thrive, They are cared for, and considered and admired. I am overlooked and snubbed, I am pushed upon and rubbed, I am always sick and ailing, sore and tired. But I carry all the weight of the body, small or great, Yet no one ever praises what I do; I am always in the way, and 'tis I who have to pay For the folly and the pride of all of you. Then the mouth and the brain and the hand said, 'tis plain Though troubled be our lives with woe, The hardest lot of all, does certainly befall The poor little, humble little toe, The snubbed little, rubbed little toe. A NAUGHTY LITTLE COMET. There was a little comet who lived near the Milky Way! She loved to wander out at night and jump about and play. The mother of the comet was a very good old star; She used to scold her reckless child for venturing out too far. She told her of the ogre, Sun, who loved on stars to sup, And who asked no better pastime than in gobbling comets up. But instead of growing cautious and of showing proper fear, The foolish little comet edged up nearer, and more near. She switched her saucy tail along right where the Sun could see, And flirted with old Mars, and was as bold as bold could be. She laughed to scorn the quiet stars who never frisked about; She said there was no fun in life unless you ventured out. She liked to make the planets stare, and wished no better mirth Than just to see the telescopes aimed at her from the Earth. She wondered how so many stars could mope through nights and days, And let the sickly faced old Moon get all the love and praise. And as she talked and tossed her head and switched her shining trail The staid old mother star grew sad, her cheek grew wan and pale. For she had lived there in the skies a million years or more, And she had heard gay comets talk in just this way before. And by and by there came an end to this gay comet's fun. She went a tiny bit too far—and vanished in the Sun! No more she swings her shining trail before the whole world's sight, But quiet stars she laughed to scorn are twinkling every night. THE AH GOO TONGUE. The queerest languages known to man, Sanscrit, Hebrew, Hindoostan, Are all translated and made as free And comprehensive as A B C. Yet the oldest language talked or sung, The strange mysterious Ah Goo tongue, The royal language of Babyland No man living can understand. Every soul in the world to-day Was one time anchored in Babyland Bay, And quarantined there for a year or more Before he even could step on shore. And everybody in Babyland Bay Talks the Ah Goo tongue, so people say, But once on land—why not a word Do they understand of it when 'tis heard. For the fairy rulers of Babyland Who guard the kingdom on every hand, Have willed that no one shall keep the key Who crosses into the Grown-up Sea. So the sweet court language has never been made A common parlance of strife or trade, But is kept in the kingdom where natives come Versed in the language of Babydom. They are all of them royal and that is how The Grown-up people all kneel and bow, When they hear that language talked or sung— The strange mysterious Ah Goo tongue. A FISHERMAN'S BABY Oh hush, little baby, thy papa's at sea; The big billows rock him as mamma rocks thee. He hastes to his dear ones o'er billows of foam; Then sleep, little darling, till papa comes home. Sleep, little baby; hush, little baby; Papa is coming, no longer to roam. The shells and the pebbles, all day tossed about, Are lulled into sleep by the tide ebbing out. The tired shore slumbers, stretched out in the sand, While the waves hurry off at mid-ocean's command. Then hush, little darling; sleep, little darling; Sleep, baby, rocked by thy mother's own hand. The winds that have rollicked all day in the west Are hushed into sleep on the calm evening's breast. The boats that were out with the wild sea at play Are now rocked to sleep in the arms of the bay. Then rest, little baby; sleep, little baby; Papa will come at the break of the day. Sleep, little darling; too soon thou wilt be A man like thy father, to sail o'er the sea. Then sleep will not come at thy bidding or prayer, For thou wilt be harassed by danger and care. Then sleep, little darling; rest, little baby; Rest whilst thou may, dear, and sleep whilst thou dare. WHAT UNCLE ROB SAYS. Uncle Rob says, That once on a time the fire flies Were stars with the others up in the skies. They used to shimmer, and dance and play, Night after night in the Milky Way. But when their papa, the stern old Sun Said “off to bed with you every one,” These bold little stars refused to obey, “Let's hide in that cloud and then run away.” “Let's run to the earth,” these bad stars said “We are quite too old to be sent to bed.” So then they were exiled out of the skies, And that's how we came with the fire flies, So Uncle Rob says. DOROTHY D. I'm sick of “musn'ts,” said Dorothy D. Sick of musn'ts, as I can be. From early dawn till the close of day I hear a musn't, and never a may. It's “you musn't lie there like a sleepy head,” And “you musn't sit up when it's time for bed.” “You musn't cry when I comb your curls,” “You musn't play with those noisy girls.” “You musn't be silent when spoken to,” “You musn't chatter as parrots do.” “You musn't be pert, and you musn't be proud,” “You musn't giggle or laugh aloud.” “You musn't rumple your nice clean dress,” “You musn't nod, in the place of a ‘yes.’” So all day long the musn'ts go, Till I dream at night of a great black row, Of goblin “musn'ts” with monstrous eyes That stare at me in a shocked surprise. Oh, I hope I will live to see the day When some one will say to me, “Dear, you may.” For I'm sick of “musn'ts,” said Dorthy D. Sick of musn'ts, as I can be. THE DISCONTENTED MANICURE SCISSORS. Said the manicure scissors one day, “The shears always have their own way, And I think it absurd That I am deterred From entering into life's fray. My task might be jolly for snails, But I must confess that it fails To give pleasure to me; I am sick as can be Of snipping the ends of pink nails. I want to do work like the shears!” So the scissors set out it appears, And very much wroth They tried to cut cloth, And so split themselves open, my dears. And the cloth, well you should have seen that; It looked as if gnawed by a rat. Now little folks, you Must not think you can do Whatever your elders are at. DREAM TOWN. Now who is ready to go with me Off and away to dream town? Oh, such a journey as that will be, All dressed in a snow white gown. No shoe or stocking, they think it shocking To wear such things in dream town street, For it's paved with posies and leaves of roses, So nothing can hurt your feet. We leave our baggage and clothes behind When we set out on this jaunt, The folks who live there are very kind, They give us whatever we want; Sometimes a dolly we take, if she's jolly And good all the day before. But they've dolls without number in that land of slumber, And of toys there's a wonderful store. We shut up our eyes when we set out, Though why I never have guessed, There's some good reason I haven't a doubt, Since every one says it is best. I think we go faster and keep off disaster, By folding our eyelids down; By dropping that curtain I'm almost certain, The sooner we get to dream town. Just inside of the city gate, Smiling and rosy and bright, The boys and the girls of dream town wait To play with us all the night. So rocking and rocking, without shoe or stocking, All dressed in a little white gown, Singing and humming, we're coming, we're coming Into the gates of dream town. THE WAY TO WONDERLAND Who knows the way to wonderland? Oh, I know, Oh, I know! Trotty-te-trot on mama's knee, Then over the billows of sleepy sea, Down through the straits of by-lo, Oh, who but mama could understand The ways that lead to wonderland. Now we are off to wonderland, You and I, you and I, Into the harbor of happy dreams, Oh how misty and fair it seems, Rock, rock a-by; Ah! no one but mama could understand The way that leads to wonderland Now we will anchor at wonderland. Slow—slow—slow—slow. The magic place where angels keep Dreams for babies who fall to sleep, Down we go, down we go, Oh, who but mama could understand How to anchor at wonderland. SHOVEL AND TONGS. The Poker proposed to the shovel That they should be man and wife, “I think,” said he, “that we could agree As we journey along through life.” The Shovel blushed as she answered, “I thank you kindly, Mister, But my promise belongs to the faithful Tongs, So I only can be your sister.” And when the couple were married The Stove gave the Shovel away; And it seemed too bad that the Poker, poor lad, Was the Tongs' best man on that day. But the Poker soon after was wedded To the hearth broom, slender and slick; And 'twas whispered about Mrs. Tongs was put out Because he found comfort so quick. INTO THE WORLD Out over childhood's borders, Manhood's brave banners unfurled, Weighed down with precepts and orders A boy has gone into the world. Nobody thinks it pathetic— For he is a strong-armed youth. But where is the vision prophetic To forecast his future with truth? No more a child to be petted And sheltered away from the strife; Henceforth—a man to be fretted And worn with the worries of life. Henceforth a man with others To scramble and push in the race, To jostle and crowd with his brothers, To struggle for gain and place. Now though his heart is breaking, Henceforth his lids must be dry; Now though his soul is aching, He must not utter a cry. Now if his brain is troubled, Now if his courage has gone, Still must his strength be doubled, Still must the battle go on. Now if success shall crown him, Oh, how the world will cheer. Now if misfortune shall down him, Oh, how the scoffer will jeer. Virtue and truth attend him, Into the vortex whirled, God and His angels defend him— A boy has gone into the world. TWO BOYS AND A CIGARETTE. Two bright little fellows, named Harry and Will, Were just the same age and the same size until One day in their travels it chanced that they met A queer little creature, surnamed cigarette. This queer little creature made friends with the boys, And told them a story of masculine joys He held for their sharing. “I tell you,” quoth he, “The way to be manly, and big, is through me.” Will listened and yielded; but Harry held out. “I think your assertions are open to doubt,” He said, “and besides I'm afraid I'd be sick.” “Afraid!” echoed Will, “oh you cowardly stick! Well, I'm not afraid, look ahere!” As he spoke, He blew out a halo of cigarette smoke. Five years from that meeting I saw them again. The time had arrived when they both should be men, But strangely enough, although Harry boy stood As tall and as strong as a tree in the wood, Poor Will seemed a dwarf; sunken eye, hollow cheek, Stoop shoulders, proclaimed him unmanly and weak. With thumb and fore-finger he listlessly rolled A cigarette, smoothing each wrinkle and fold, And the smoke that he puffed from his lips, I declare, Took the form of a demon and grinned from the air. And it said “See that wreck of a man that I made Of the boastful young fellow who wasn't afraid.” IN GRANDMAMMA'S KITCHEN In grandmamma's kitchen, things got in a riot— The cream in a pot on the shelf, Where everything always seemed peaceful and quiet, Got whipped, for I heard it myself. And grandmamma said—such a queer thing to say, That it made some things better to whip them that way. Some bold naughty eggs that refused to be eaten, On toast with their brothers may be, Were stripped of their clothing and cruelly beaten Right where all the dishes could see. And grandmamma said though the poor things might ache, The harder the beating, the lighter the cake. The bright golden butter was petted and patted And coaxed to be shapely and good. But it finally had to be taken and spatted Right hard with a paddle of wood. When grandmamma carried the round balls away, The buttermilk sulked, and looked sour all day. The water declared that the coffee was muddy, But an egg settled that little fuss. Then the steak and the gridiron got in a bloody And terrible broil! Such a muss! And a flat-iron spat at grandma in the face, And I ran away from the quarrelsome place. THE HEN'S COMPLAINT. Beside an incubator stood The would-be mother of a brood. With drooping wings and nodding head, These are the clucked-out words she said: “O, vile invention of the age, You fill me with a burning rage! Unfeeling monster, moved by steam, You rob me of life's sweetest dream! Deprived of offspring which I crave, I must go childless to my grave. My aching wings which long to cover A chirping brood of nestlings over, No more may know that comfort sweet, Since chickens may be hatched by heat. Three weeks of quiet expectation (Full many a flighty hen's salvation) I am denied, for now men say A hen should be content to lay, And furnish eggs to incubate, And setting hens are out of date. Alas, for such a cruel fashion—” The angry fowl paused, choked with passion, While from behind a strong hand caught her And doused her in a tub of water. FIVE LITTLE FINGERS. This is the baby who doesn't do a thing, This is the lady who loves to wear a ring, This is their big sister, this is another, And this stout thumb is their great sturdy brother. FIVE LITTLE TOES IN THE MORNING. This little toe is hungry— This little toe is too, This toe lies abed like a sleepy head, And this toe cries “Boo-hoo.” This toe big and tall is the smartest of all For he pops into stocking and shoe. FIVE LITTLE TOES AT NIGHT. This little toe is tired, This little toe needs rocking, This little toe is sleepy you know, But this little toe keeps talking, This toe big and tall is the mischief of all, For he made a great hole in his stocking. THE KING OF CANDYLAND Have you heard of the king of Candy land? Well, listen while I sing, He has pages on every hand, For he is a mighty king, And thousands of children bend the knee, And bow to this ruler of high degree. He has a smile, oh! like the sun! And his face is round and bland, His bright eyes twinkle and glow with fun, As the children kiss his hand. And everything toothsome, melting, sweet, He scatters freely before their feet. But wo! for the children who follow him, With loving praises and laughter, For he is a monster ugly and grim That they go running after. And when they get well into the chase He lifts his masque and shows his face. And ah! but that is a gruesome sight For the followers of the king. The cheeks grow pale that once were bright, And they sob instead of sing. And their teeth drop out and their eyes grow red, And they cannot sleep when they go to bed. And after they see the monster's face, They have no peaceful hour. And they have aches in every place, And what was sweet seems sour. Oh wo! for that sorrowful foolish band Who follow the king of Candy land. I TOLD YOU SO. I know a little fellow, his name I think is Jo, But he is seldom called by that—he has a queer nick-name, Wherever he goes the children cry, “There comes ‘I-told-you-so.’” For that is what he always says in playing any game, “I told you so! I told you so! You see I was right when I told you so.” He is not more than twelve at most and, yet, to hear him brag, You would believe him forty-five, so much he seems to know. Whatever the sport or fun may be, if marbles, ball or tag, You hear his shrill young voice ring out “There, now, I told you so. I told you so, I told you so, You see I was right, for I told you so.” He thinks the children most unkind when they refuse to play, Or when they hide their plans from him and do not let him know! He never thinks how hard it is to hear day after day That aggravating cry of his, “There now, I told you so. I told you so, I told you so, You see I was right, for I told you so.” The boy is bright and smart enough, and might be loved by all, If he could learn one truth which not all grown up people know. That truth is this: in life's great game, no matter what befall, The nobler nature never cries, “There now, I told you so. I told you so, I told you so,” 'Tis the cry of the braggart, I told you so. BEDLAM TOWN Do you want to peep into Bedlam Town? Then come with me, when the day swings down, Into the cradle, whose rockers rim, Some people call the horizon dim. All the mischief of all the fates Seems to center in four little pates, Just one hour before we say, “It is time for bed now, stop your play.” O, the racket and noise, and roar As they prance like a caravan over the floor, With never a thought of the head that aches, And never a heed to the “mercy sakes.” And “Pity, save us,” and “Oh! dear, dear,” Which all but the culprits plainly hear. A dog, a parrot, a guinea hen, Warriors, elephants, Indian men, A salvation army, a grizzly bear, Are all at once in the nursery there. And when the clock in the hall strikes seven It sounds to us like a voice from heaven; And each of the elves in a warm nightgown, March away out of Bedlam Town. THE LAND OF NOWHERE. Do you know where the summer blooms all the year 'round, Where there never is rain on a pic-nic day? Where the thornless rose in its beauty blows And little boys never are called from play? Then, oh! hey! it is far away— In the wonderful land of Nowhere. Would you like to live where nobody scolds, Where you never are told “it is time for bed,” Where you learn without trying and laugh without crying, Where snarls never pull when they comb your head? Then, oh! hey! it is far away In the wonderful land of Nowhere. Do you long to dwell where you never need wait, Where no one is punished or made to cry, Where a supper of cakes is not followed by aches And little folks thrive on a diet of pie? Then, oh! hey! you must go away To the wonderful land of Nowhere. You must drift down the river of idle dreams, Close to the border of No-man's-land. For a year and a day you must sail away And then you will come to an unknown strand And oh! hey! if you get there—stay In the wonderful land of Nowhere! THE STORY OF GRUMBLE TONE. There was a boy named Grumble Tone, who ran away to sea. “I'm sick of things on land,” he said, “as sick as I can be, A life upon the bounding wave is just the life for me!” But the seething ocean billows failed to stimulate his mirth, For he did not like the vessel or the dizzy rolling berth, And he thought the sea was almost as unpleasant as the earth. He wandered into foreign lands, he saw each wondrous sight, But nothing that he heard or saw seemed just exactly right, And so he journeyed on and on, still seeking for delight. He talked with kings and ladies grand; he dined in courts, they say, But always found the people dull and longed to get away To search for that mysterious land where he should want to stay. He wandered over all the world, his hair grew white as snow, He reached that final bourne at last where all of us must go, But never found the land he sought; the reason would you know? The reason was that north or south, where'er his steps were bent, On land or sea, in court or hall, he found but discontent, For he took his disposition with him, everywhere he went. THE ISLAND OF ENDLESS PLAY. Said Willie to Tom “Let us hie away To the wonderful Island of Endless Play. It lies off the border of ‘No School Land’ And abounds with pleasures, I understand. There boys go swimming whenever they please In a lovely river right under the trees. And marbles are free, no one has to buy; And kites of all sizes are ready to fly. We sail down the Isthmus of Idle Delight, We sail and we sail for a day and a night. And then if favored by billows and breeze We land in the harbor of Do-as-you-please. And their lies the Island of Endless Play With no one to say to us Must or Nay. Books are not known in that land so fair, Teachers are stoned if they set foot there. Hurrah for the Island so glad and free, That is the country for you and me.” So away went Willie and Tom together On a pleasure boat, in the lazy weather, And they sailed in the teeth of a friendly breeze Right into the harbor of “Do-as-you-please!” Where boats and tackle and marbles and kites Were waiting them there in this Land of Delights. They dwelt on the Island of Endless Play For five long years; then one sad day A strange dark ship sailed up to the strand, And “Ho! for the voyage to Stupid Land.” The Captain cried with a terrible noise As he seized the frightened and struggling boys, And threw them into the dark Ship's hold, And off and away sailed the Captain bold. They vainly begged him to let them out, He answered only with scoff and shout. “Boys that don't study or work,” said he, “Must sail one day down the Ignorant Sea To Stupid Land by the No-Book strait, With Captain Time on the Pitiless Fate.” Then he let out the sails and away went the three, Over the waters of Ignorant Sea. Out and away to Stupid Land, And they live there yet, I understand. And there's where every one goes, they say, Who seeks the Island of Endless Play. The Needle and Thread The Needle and Thread one day were wed, The Thimble acted as priest, A paper of Pins, and the Scissors twins Were among the guests at the feast. That dandy trim the Bodkin slim Danced with Miss Tape-measure, But he stepped on her trail, and she called him “a whale,” And that put an end to their pleasure. Wrinkled and fat the Beeswax sat And talked with the Needle-case. “I am glad,” she said, “that my niece, the Thread, Has married into this race. “Her mother, the Spool, was a dull old fool, And the Needle and Thread were shy; The result you see came all through me, I taught her to catch his eye.” The Emery-ball just there had a fall— She had danced too long at one time, And that put a stop to the merry hop, And that brings an end to my rhyme. The groom and the bride took their wedding ride Down a long white-seam to the shore, And the guests all said there never was wed So fair a couple before. THE BARBAROUS CHIEF. There was a kingdom known as the Mind, A kingdom vast as fair, And the brave king, Brain, had the right to reign, In royal splendor there. Oh! that was a beautiful, beautiful land, Which unto this king was given; Filled with everything good and grand, And it reached from earth to heaven. But a savage monster came one day From over a distant border; He warred with the king and disputed his sway, And set the whole land in disorder. He mounted the throne, which he made his own, He sunk the kingdom in grief. There was trouble and shame from the hour he came— Illtemper, the barbarous chief. He threw down the castles of love and peace, He burned up the altars of prayers. He trod down the grain that was planted by Brain, And scattered thistles and tares. He wasted the store-house of knowledge and drove Queen Wisdom away in fright; And a terrible gloom, like the cloud of doom, Shrouded that land in night. Bent on more havoc away he rushed To the neighboring kingdom, Heart; And the blossoms of kindness and hope he crushed— And patience he pierced with his dart, And he even went on to the Isthmus Soul, That unites the mind with God, And its beautiful bowers of fragrant flowers With a ruthless heel he trod. To you is given this wonderful land Where the lordly Brain has sway; But the border ruffian is near at hand, Be on your guard, I pray. Beware of Illtemper, the barbarous chief, He is cruel as vice or sin, And your beautiful kingdom will come to grief If once you let him in. BOYS' AND GIRLS' THANKSGIVING OF 1892. Never since the race was started, Had a boy in any clime, Cause to be so thankful-hearted, As the boys of present time. Not a girl in old times living— Let the world talk as it may— Found such reasons for Thanksgiving, As the girls who live to-day! Grandmas, in their corners sitting, Toiling till the day grew late, What knew they with endless knitting, Of the jolly roller-skate? Grandpas sitting by the fender, Reading by the faggots' blaze, What knew they of modern splendor Found in incandescent rays? Where they toiled in bitter weather, Braving rain and snow and sleet, Gathering sticks of wood together, We have radiators' heat. But these fruits of modern science They first planted seed by seed, In their strength and self-reliance We may find a noble creed. With the dawn of great inventions, Came the anti-warring days. Men are sick of armed contentions, God be thanked with heart-felt praise. Once a boy was trained for fighting, Now the world is better taught, 'Tis an age when wrongs are righting By the force of common thought. Once a girl was trained for sewing, Spinning, knitting, nothing more. She must never think of knowing Aught of things outside her door. If she soared above her spinning, If she sought a life more broad, She was looked upon as sinning 'Gainst the laws of man and God. Now a girl is taught she's human, Brain and body, soul and heart— All are needed by the woman Who to-day would play her part. Swift and sure the world advances, Let the critic carp who may. God be praised for all the chances Boys and girls enjoy to-day. MOTHER'S KISSES. Baby was playing and down he fell, down he fell, down he fell, Mama will kiss him and make him well, Oh! what a miracle this is! Baby was running and stubbed his toe, stubbed his toe, stubbed his toe, If mama will kiss him the pain will go— Magical mother's kisses. Once an angel fair and calm, Brewed a wondrous soothing balm From the sweet immortal flowers, Growing in the heavenly bowers, Then the mothers of the earth, All were called and told its worth. “But anoint your lips with this,” Said the angel, “and your kiss Shall have magic in its touch.” Now 'tis plain to see why such Soothing balm for bruise or wound In a mother's kiss is found. Baby was playing and down he fell, down he fell, down he fell, Mama will kiss him, and make him well, Oh! what a miracle this is. Baby was running and stubbed his toe, stubbed his toe, stubbed his toe, If mama kisses him, pain will go— Magical mother's kisses. SOCIAL INEQUALITY, Puss with a ribbon met pussy with none. Who stopped for a friendly chat; But the ribboned Pussy said coldly “Begone, You common, insolent cat! Your social position is open to doubt, While the badge of my own I wear,” And Puss with a ribbon at Puss without Looked straight with a stony stare. THE OGRE SLAM-THE-DOOR. There is a certain castle that is beautiful and fair, And plants, and birds, and pretty things, fill every room and hall, But alas! for the unhappy folks who make their dwelling there, A dreadful ogre haunts the house and tries to kill them all. Some day I fear will find them dead and stretched out in their gore The victims of this ogre grim, this wicked Slam-the-door! He's a very tiny ogre just about as tall as you! He never carries hidden arms, or plays with guns and knives. And yet he almost splits the heads of people thro' and thro.' And I think him very dangerous to comfort and to lives. And he often shakes the castle from the ceiling to the floor. This awful, awful ogre known as little Slam-the-door. He gets up bright and early, and he's, oh, so wide awake! And wo! to all the sleepy heads and invalids who doze, They dream the sky is caving in, or that a vast earthquake Has suddenly convulsed the world and ended their repose, As to and fro, and up and down, still noisier than before, They hear the hurrying, flurrying feet of ogre Slam-the-door. Though the Princess of the Castle has a headache, and is ill, Though the Prince is in his study and wants quiet for an hour, This wicked little ogre won't be quiet—or keep still I almost think he sometimes knows he has them in his power. Alas, alas for all the folks, their sorrows I deplore— The folks shut in that castle with the ogre Slam-the-door. CURIOUS STORY I heard such a curious story Of Santa Claus. Once, so they say, He set out to find what people were kind, Before he took presents their way. “This year I will give but to givers, To those who make presents themselves.” With a nod of his head, old Santa Claus said To his band of bright officer elves: “Go into the homes of the happy Where Pleasure stands page at the door, Watch well how they live, and report what they give To the hordes of God's suffering poor. Keep track of each cent and each moment, Yea, tell me each word, too, they use, To silver line clouds for earth's suffering crowds, And tell me, too, when they refuse.” So, into our homes flew the fairies, Though never a soul of us knew, And with pencil and book, they sat by us, and took Each action, if false or if true. White marks for the deeds done for others, Black marks for the deeds done for self, And nobody hid what he said or he did, For no one, of course, sees an elf. Well, Christmas came all in its season And Santa Claus, so I am told, With a very light pack of small gifts on his back And his reindeers all left in the fold, Set out on a leisurely journey, And finished ere midnight, they say, And there never had been such surprise and chagrin, Before on the breaking of day As there was on that bright Christmas morning When stockings and cupboards and shelves Were ransacked and sought in for gifts that were not in— But wasn't it fun for the elves? And what did I get? You confuse me— I got not one thing, and that's true, But had I suspected my actions detected I would have had gifts—wouldn't you?</field>
