      <field name="fulltext">The Black Riders and Other Lines [I. Black riders came from the sea] Black riders came from the sea. There was clang and clang of spear and shield, And clash and clash of hoof and heel, Wild shouts and the wave of hair In the rush upon the wind: Thus the ride of sin. [II. Three little birds in a row] Three little birds in a row Sat musing. A man passed near that place Then did the little birds nudge each other. They said: “He thinks he can sing.” They threw back their heads to laugh. With quaint countenances They regarded him. They were very curious Those three little birds in a row. [III. In the desert] In the desert I saw a creature, naked, bestial, Who, squatting upon the ground, Held his heart in his hands, And ate of it. I said, “Is it good, friend?” “It is bitter—bitter,” he answered; “But I like it “Because it is bitter, “And because it is my heart.” [IV. Yes, I have a thousand tongues] Yes, I have a thousand tongues, And nine and ninety-nine lie. Though I strive to use the one, It will make no melody at my will, But is dead in my mouth. [V. Once there came a man] Once there came a man Who said, “Range me all men of the world in rows.” And instantly There was terrific clamor among the people Against being ranged in rows. There was a loud quarrel, world-wide. It endured for ages; And blood was shed By those who would not stand in rows, And by those who pined to stand in rows. Eventually, the man went to death, weeping. And those who staid in bloody scuffle Knew not the great simplicity. [VI. God fashioned the ship of the world carefully] God fashioned the ship of the world carefully. With the infinite skill of an all-master Made He the hull and the sails, Held He the rudder Ready for adjustment. Erect stood He, scanning His work proudly. Then—at fateful time—a wrong called, And God turned, heeding. Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly, Making cunning noiseless travel down the ways. So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas Going ridiculous voyages, Making quaint progress, Turning as with serious purpose Before stupid winds. And there were many in the sky Who laughed at this thing. [VII. Mystic shadow, bending near me] Mystic shadow, bending near me, Who art thou? Whence come ye? And—tell me—is it fair Or is the truth bitter as eaten fire? Tell me! Fear not that I should quaver, For I dare—I dare. Then, tell me! [VIII. I looked here] I looked here I looked there No where could I see my love. And—this time— She was in my heart. Truly then I have no complaint For 'though she be fair and fairer She is none so fair as she In my heart. [IX. I stood upon a high place] I stood upon a high place, And saw, below, many devils Running, leaping, And carousing in sin. One looked up, grinning, And said, “Comrade! Brother!” [X. Should the wide world roll away] Should the wide world roll away Leaving black terror Limitless night, Nor God, nor man, nor place to stand Would be to me essential If thou and thy white arms were there And the fall to doom a long way. [XI. In a lonely place] In a lonely place, I encountered a sage Who sat, all still, Regarding a newspaper. He accosted me: “Sir, what is this?” Then I saw that I was greater, Aye, greater than this sage. I answered him at once, “Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age.” The sage looked upon me with admiration. [XII. Well, then, I hate Thee, unrighteous picture] “And the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the heads of the children, even unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.” Well, then, I hate Thee, unrighteous picture; Wicked image, I hate Thee; So, strike with Thy vengeance The heads of those little men Who come blindly. It will be a brave thing. [XIII. If there is a witness to my little life] If there is a witness to my little life, To my tiny throes and struggles, He sees a fool; And it is not fine for gods to menace fools. [XIV. There was crimson clash of war] There was crimson clash of war. Lands turned black and bare; Women wept; Babes ran, wondering. There came one who understood not these things. He said, “Why is this?” Whereupon a million strove to answer him. There was such intricate clamor of tongues, That still the reason was not. [XV. “Tell brave deeds of war.”] “Tell brave deeds of war.” Then they recounted tales,— “There were stern stands “And bitter runs for glory.” Ah, I think there were braver deeds. [XVI. Charity, thou art a lie] Charity, thou art a lie, A toy of women, A pleasure of certain men. In the presence of justice, Lo, the walls of the temple Are visible Through thy form of sudden shadows. [XVII. There were many who went in huddled procession] There were many who went in huddled procession, They knew not whither; But, at any rate, success or calamity Would attend all in equality. There was one who sought a new road. He went into direful thickets, And ultimately he died thus, alone; But they said he had courage. [XVIII. In Heaven] In Heaven, Some little blades of grass Stood before God. “What did you do?” Then all save one of the little blades Began eagerly to relate The merits of their lives. This one stayed a small way behind Ashamed. Presently God said: “And what did you do?” The little blade answered: “Oh, my lord, Memory is bitter to me For if I did good deeds I know not of them.” Then God in all His splendor Arose from His throne. “Oh, best little blade of grass,” He said. [XIX. A god in wrath] A god in wrath Was beating a man; He cuffed him loudly With thunderous blows That rang and rolled over the earth. All people came running. The man screamed and struggled, And bit madly at the feet of the god. The people cried, “Ah, what a wicked man!” And— “Ah, what a redoubtable god!” [XX. A learned man came to me once] A learned man came to me once. He said, “I know the way,—come.” And I was overjoyed at this. Together we hastened. Soon, too soon, were we Where my eyes were useless, And I knew not the ways of my feet. I clung to the hand of my friend; But at last he cried, “I am lost.” [XXI. There was, before me] There was, before me, Mile upon mile Of snow, ice, burning sand. And yet I could look beyond all this, To a place of infinite beauty; And I could see the loveliness of her Who walked in the shade of the trees. When I gazed, All was lost But this place of beauty and her. When I gazed, And in my gazing, desired, Then came again Mile upon mile, Of snow, ice, burning sand. [XXII. Once I saw mountains angry] Once I saw mountains angry, And ranged in battle-front. Against them stood a little man; Aye, he was no bigger than my finger. I laughed, and spoke to one near me, “Will he prevail?” “Surely,” replied this other; “His grandfathers beat them ymany times.” Then did I see much virtue in grandfathers,— At least, for the little man Who stood against the mountains. [XXIII. Places among the stars] Places among the stars, Soft gardens near the sun, Keep your distant beauty; Shed no beams upon my weak heart. Since she is here In a place of blackness, Not your golden days Nor your silver nights Can call me to you. Since she is here In a place of blackness, Here I stay and wait. [XXIV. I saw a man pursuing the horizon] I saw a man pursuing the horizon; Round and round they sped. I was disturbed at this; I accosted the man. “It is futile,” I said, “You can never—” “You lie,” he cried, And ran on. [XXV. Behold, the grave of a wicked man] Behold, the grave of a wicked man, And near it, a stern spirit. There came a drooping maid with violets, But the spirit grasped her arm. “No flowers for him,” he said. The maid wept: “Ah, I loved him.” But the spirit, grim and frowning: “No flowers for him.” Now, this is it— If the spirit was just, Why did the maid weep? [XXVI. There was set before me a mighty hill] There was set before me a mighty hill, And long days I climbed Through regions of snow. When I had before me the summit-view, It seemed that my labor Had been to see gardens Lying at impossible distances. [XXVII. A youth in apparel that glittered] A youth in apparel that glittered Went to walk in a grim forest. There he met an assassin Attired all in garb of old days; He, scowling through the thickets, And dagger poised quivering, Rushed upon the youth. “Sir,” said this latter, “I am enchanted, believe me, To die, thus, In this medieval fashion, According to the best legends; Ah, what joy!” Then took he the wound, smiling, And died, content. [XXVIII. “Truth,” said a traveller] “Truth,” said a traveller, “Is a rock, a mighty fortress; “Often have I been to it, “Even to its highest tower, “From whence the world looks black.” “Truth,” said a traveller, “Is a breath, a wind, “A shadow, a phantom; “Long have I pursued it, “But never have I touched “The hem of its garment.” And I believed the second traveller; For truth was to me A breath, a wind, A shadow, a phantom, And never had I touched The hem of its garment. [XXIX. Behold, from the land of the farther suns] Behold, from the land of the farther suns I returned. And I was in a reptile-swarming place, Peopled, otherwise, with grimaces, Shrouded above in black impenetrableness. I shrank, loathing, Sick with it. And I said to him, “What is this?” He made answer slowly, “Spirit, this is a world; “This was your home.” [XXX. Supposing that I should have the courage] Supposing that I should have the courage To let a red sword of virtue Plunge into my heart, Letting to the weeds of the ground My sinful blood, What can you offer me? A gardened castle? A flowery kingdom? What? A hope? Then hence with your red sword of virtue. [XXXI. Many workmen] Many workmen Built a huge ball of masonry Upon a mountain-top. Then they went to the valley below, And turned to behold their work. “It is grand,” they said; They loved the thing. Of a sudden, it moved: It came upon them swiftly; It crushed them all to blood. But some had opportunity to squeal. [XXXII. Two or three angels] Two or three angels Came near to the earth. They saw a fat church. Little black streams of people Came and went in continually. And the angels were puzzled To know why the people went thus, And why they stayed so long within. [XXXIII. There was One I met upon the road] There was One I met upon the road Who looked at me with kind eyes. He said: “Show me of your wares.” And this I did Holding forth one. He said: “It is a sin.” Then held I forth another. He said: “It is a sin.” Then held I forth another. He said: “It is a sin.” And so to the end Always He said: “It is a sin.” And, finally, I cried out: “But I have none other.” Then did He look at me With kinder eyes. “Poor soul,” He said. [XXXIV. I stood upon a highway] I stood upon a highway, And, behold, there came Many strange pedlers. To me each one made gestures, Holding forth little images, saying, “This is my pattern of God. “Now this is the God I prefer.” But I said, “Hence! “Leave me with mine own, “And take you yours away; “I can't buy of your patterns of God, “The little gods you may rightly prefer.” [XXXV. A man saw a ball of gold in the sky] A man saw a ball of gold in the sky; He climbed for it, And eventually he achieved it— It was clay. Now this is the strange part: When the man went to the earth And looked again, Lo, there was the ball of gold. Now this is the strange part: It was a ball of gold. Aye, by the heavens, it was a ball of gold. [XXXVI. I met a seer] I met a seer. He held in his hands The book of wisdom. “Sir,” I addressed him, “Let me read.” “Child—” he began. “Sir,” I said, “Think not that I am a child, “For already I know much “Of that which you hold. “Aye, much.” He smiled. Then he opened the book And held it before me.— Strange that I should have grown so suddenly blind. [XXXVII. On the horizon the peaks assembled] On the horizon the peaks assembled; And as I looked, The march of the mountains began. As they marched, they sang, “Aye! We come! We come!” [XXXVIII. The ocean said to me once] The ocean said to me once, “Look! “Yonder on the shore “Is a woman, weeping. “I have watched her. “Go you and tell her this,— “Her lover I have laid “In cool green hall. “There is wealth of golden sand “And pillars, coral-red; “Two white fish stand guard at his bier. “Tell her this “And more,— “That the king of the seas “Weeps too, old, helpless man. “The bustling fates “Heap his hands with corpses “Until he stands like a child “With surplus of toys.” [XXXIX. The livid lightnings flashed in the clouds] The livid lightnings flashed in the clouds; The leaden thunders crashed. A worshipper raised his arm. “Hearken! Hearken! The voice of God!” “Not so,” said a man. “The voice of God whispers in the heart “So softly “That the soul pauses, “Making no noise, “And strives for these melodies, “Distant, sighing, like faintest breath, “And all the being is still to hear.” [XL. And you love me?] And you love me? I love you. You are, then, cold coward. Aye; but, beloved, When I strive to come to you, Man's opinions, a thousand thickets, My interwoven existence, My life, Caught in the stubble of the world Like a tender veil,— This stays me. No strange move can I make Without noise of tearing. I dare not. If love loves, There is no world Nor word. All is lost Save thought of love And place to dream. You love me? I love you. You are, then, cold coward. Aye; but, beloved— [XLI. Love walked alone] Love walked alone. The rocks cut her tender feet, And the brambles tore her fair limbs. There came a companion to her, But, alas, he was no help, For his name was Heart's Pain. [XLII. I walked in a desert] I walked in a desert. And I cried, “Ah, God, take me from this place!” A voice said, “It is no desert.” I cried, “Well, but— “The sand, the heat, the vacant horizon.” A voice said, “It is no desert.” [XLIII. There came whisperings in the winds] There came whisperings in the winds: “Good-bye! Good-bye!” Little voices called in the darkness: “Good-bye! Good-bye!” Then I stretched forth my arms. “No—No—” There came whisperings in the wind: “Good-bye! Good-bye!” Little voices called in the darkness: “Good-bye! Good-bye!” [XLIV. I was in the darkness] I was in the darkness; I could not see my words Nor the wishes of my heart. Then suddenly there was a great light— “Let me into the darkness again.” [XLV. Tradition, thou art for suckling children] Tradition, thou art for suckling children, Thou art the enlivening milk for babes; But no meat for men is in thee. Then— But, alas, we all are babes. [XLVI. Many red devils ran from my heart] Many red devils ran from my heart And out upon the page. They were so tiny The pen could mash them. And many struggled in the ink. It was strange To write in this red muck Of things from my heart. [XLVII. “Think as I think,” said a man] “Think as I think,” said a man, “Or you are abominably wicked; “You are a toad.” And after I had thought of it, I said, “I will, then, be a toad.” [XLVIII. Once there was a man] Once there was a man,— Oh, so wise! In all drink He detected the bitter, And in all touch He found the sting. At last he cried thus: “There is nothing,— “No life, “No joy, “No pain,— “There is nothing save opinion, “And opinion be damned.” [XLIX. I stood musing in a black world] I stood musing in a black world, Not knowing where to direct my feet. And I saw the quick stream of men Pouring ceaselessly, Filled with eager faces, A torrent of desire. I called to them, “Where do you go? What do you see?” A thousand voices called to me. A thousand fingers pointed. “Look! Look! There!” I know not of it. But, lo! in the far sky shone a radiance Ineffable, divine,— A vision painted upon a pall; And sometimes it was, And sometimes it was not. I hesitated. Then from the stream Came roaring voices, Impatient: “Look! Look! There!” So again I saw, And leaped, unhesitant, And struggled and fumed With outspread clutching fingers. The hard hills tore my flesh; The ways bit my feet. At last I looked again. No radiance in the far sky, Ineffable, divine; No vision painted upon a pall; And always my eyes ached for the light. Then I cried in despair, “I see nothing! Oh, where do I go?” The torrent turned again its faces: “Look! Look! There!” And at the blindness of my spirit They screamed, “Fool! Fool! Fool!” [L. You say you are holy] You say you are holy, And that Because I have not seen you sin. Aye, but there are those Who see you sin, my friend. [LI. A man went before a strange god] A man went before a strange god,— The god of many men, sadly wise. And the deity thundered loudly, Fat with rage, and puffing, “Kneel, mortal, and cringe “And grovel and do homage “To my particularly sublime majesty.” The man fled. Then the man went to another god,— The god of his inner thoughts. And this one looked at him With soft eyes Lit with infinite comprehension, And said, “My poor child!” [LII. Why do you strive for greatness, fool?] Why do you strive for greatness, fool? Go pluck a bough and wear it. It is as sufficing. My lord, there are certain barbarians Who tilt their noses As if the stars were flowers, And thy servant is lost among their shoe-buckles. Fain would I have mine eyes even with their eyes. Fool, go pluck a bough and wear it. [LIII. Blustering god] I Blustering god, Stamping across the sky With loud swagger, I fear you not. No, though from your highest heaven You plunge your spear at my heart, I fear you not. No, not if the blow Is as the lightning blasting a tree, I fear you not, puffing braggart. II If thou can see into my heart That I fear thee not, Thou wilt see why I fear thee not, And why it is right. So threaten not, thou, with thy bloody spears, Else thy sublime ears shall hear curses. III Withal, there is one whom I fear; I fear to see grief upon that face. Perchance, friend, he is not your god; If so, spit upon him. By it you will do no profanity. But I— Ah, sooner would I die Than see tears in those eyes of my soul. [LIV. “It was wrong to do this,” said the angel] “It was wrong to do this,” said the angel. “You should live like a flower, “Holding malice like a puppy, “Waging war like a lambkin.” “Not so,” quoth the man Who had no fear of spirits; “It is only wrong for angels “Who can live like the flowers, “Holding malice like the puppies, “Waging war like the lambkins.” [LV. A man toiled on a burning road] A man toiled on a burning road, Never resting. Once he saw a fat, stupid ass Grinning at him from a green place. The man cried out in rage, “Ah! do not deride me, fool! “I know you— “All day stuffing your belly, “Burying your heart “In grass and tender sprouts: “It will not suffice you.” But the ass only grinned at him from the green place. [LVI. A man feared that he might find an assassin] A man feared that he might find an assassin; Another that he might find a victim. One was more wise than the other. [LVII. With eye and with gesture] With eye and with gesture You say you are holy. I say you lie; For I did see you Draw away your coats From the sin upon the hands Of a little child. Liar! [LVIII. The sage lectured brilliantly] The sage lectured brilliantly. Before him, two images: “Now this one is a devil, “And this one is me.” He turned away. Then a cunning pupil Changed the positions. Turned the sage again: “Now this one is a devil, “And this one is me.” The pupils sat, all grinning, And rejoiced in the game. But the sage was a sage. [LIX. Walking in the sky] Walking in the sky, A man in strange black garb Encountered a radiant form. Then his steps were eager; Bowed he devoutly. “My lord,” said he. But the spirit knew him not. [LX. Upon the road of my life] Upon the road of my life, Passed me many fair creatures, Clothed all in white, and radiant. To one, finally, I made speech: “Who art thou?” But she, like the others, Kept cowled her face, And answered in haste, anxiously, “I am Good Deed, forsooth; “You have often seen me.” “Not uncowled,” I made reply. And with rash and strong hand, Though she resisted, I drew away the veil And gazed at the features of Vanity. She, shamefaced, went on; And after I had mused a time, I said of myself, “Fool!” [LXI] I. There was a man and a woman There was a man and a woman Who sinned. Then did the man heap the punishment All upon the head of her, And went away gayly. II There was a man and a woman Who sinned. And the man stood with her. As upon her head, so upon his, Fell blow and blow, And all people screaming, “Fool!” He was a brave heart. III He was a brave heart. Would you speak with him, friend? Well, he is dead, And there went your opportunity. Let it be your grief That he is dead And your opportunity gone; For, in that, you were a coward. [LXII. There was a man who lived a life of fire] There was a man who lived a life of fire. Even upon the fabric of time, Where purple becomes orange And orange purple, This life glowed, A dire red stain, indelible; Yet when he was dead, He saw that he had not lived. [LXIII. There was a great cathedral] There was a great cathedral. To solemn songs, A white procession Moved toward the altar. The chief man there Was erect, and bore himself proudly. Yet some could see him cringe, As in a place of danger, Throwing frightened glances into the air, A-start at threatening faces of the past. [LXIV. Friend, your white beard sweeps the ground] Friend, your white beard sweeps the ground. Why do you stand, expectant? Do you hope to see it In one of your withered days? With your old eyes Do you hope to see The triumphal march of justice? Do not wait, friend. Take your white beard And your old eyes To more tender lands. [LXV. Once, I knew a fine song] Once, I knew a fine song, —It is true, believe me,— It was all of birds, And I held them in a basket; When I opened the wicket, Heavens! They all flew away. I cried, “Come back, little thoughts!” But they only laughed. They flew on Until they were as sand Thrown between me and the sky. [LXVI. If I should cast off this tattered coat] If I should cast off this tattered coat, And go free into the mighty sky; If I should find nothing there But a vast blue, Echoless, ignorant,— What then? [LXVII. God lay dead in Heaven] God lay dead in Heaven; Angels sang the hymn of the end; Purple winds went moaning, Their wings drip-dripping With blood That fell upon the earth. It, groaning thing, Turned black and sank. Then from the far caverns Of dead sins Came monsters, livid with desire. They fought, Wrangled over the world, A morsel. But of all sadness this was sad,— A woman's arms tried to shield The head of a sleeping man From the jaws of the final beast. [LXVIII. A spirit sped] A spirit sped Through spaces of night; And as he sped, he called, “God! God!” He went through valleys Of black death-slime, Ever calling, “God! God!” Their echoes From crevice and cavern Mocked him: “God! God! God!” Fleetly into the plains of space He went, ever calling, “God! God!” Eventually, then, he screamed, Mad in denial, “Ah, there is no God!” A swift hand, A sword from the sky, Smote him, And he was dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">War is Kind [Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind] Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind. Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky And the affrighted steed ran on alone, Do not weep. War is kind. Hoarse, booming drums of the regiment Little souls who thirst for fight, These men were born to drill and die The unexplained glory flies above them Great is the battle-god, great, and his kingdom— A field where a thousand corpses lie. Do not weep, babe, for war is kind. Because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches, Raged at his breast, gulped and died, Do not weep. War is kind. Swift, blazing flag of the regiment Eagle with crest of red and gold, These men were born to drill and die Point for them the virtue of slaughter Make plain to them the excellence of killing And a field where a thousand corpses lie. Mother whose heart hung humble as a button On the bright splendid shroud of your son, Do not weep. War is kind. [What says the sea, little shell] “What says the sea, little shell? “What says the sea? “Long has our brother been silent to us “Kept his message for the ships “Awkward ships, stupid ships.” “The sea bids you mourn, oh, pines “Sing low in the moonlight. “He sends tale of the land of doom “Of place where endless falls “A rain of women's tears “And men in grey robes “—Men in grey robes— “Chant the unknown pain.” “What says the sea, little shell? “What says the sea? “Long has our brother been silent to us “Kept his message for the ships “Puny ships, silly ships.” “The sea bids you teach, oh, pines “Sing low in the moonlight. “Teach the gold of patience “Cry gospel of gentle hands “Cry a brotherhood of hearts “The sea bids you teach, oh, pines.” “And where is the reward, little shell? “What says the sea? “Long has our brother been silent to us “Kept his message for the ships “Puny ships, silly ships.” “No word says the sea, oh, pines “No word says the sea. “Long will your brother be silent to you “Keep his message for the ships “Oh, puny pines, silly pines.” [To the maiden] To the maiden The sea was blue meadow Alive with little froth-people Singing. To the sailor, wrecked, The sea was dead grey walls Superlative in vacancy Upon which nevertheless at fateful time, Was written The grim hatred of nature. [A little ink more or less] A little ink more or less! It surely can't matter? Even the sky and the opulent sea, The plains and the hills, aloof, Hear the uproar of all these books. But it is only a little ink more or less. What? You define me God with these trinkets? Can my misery meal on an ordered walking Of surpliced numbskulls? And a fanfare of lights? Or even upon the measured pulpiting Of the familiar false and true? Is this God? Where, then, is hell? Show me some bastard mushroom Sprung from a pollution of blood. It is better. Where is God? [“Have you ever made a just man?”] “Have you ever made a just man?” “Oh, I have made three,” answered God “But two of them are dead “And the third— “Listen! Listen! “And you will hear the thud of his defeat.” [I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night] I explain the silvered passing of a ship at night The sweep of each sad lost wave The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving The little cry of a man to a man A shadow falling across the greyer night And the sinking of the small star. Then the waste, the far waste of waters And the soft lashing of black waves For long and in loneliness. Remember, thou, oh ship of love Thou leavest a far waste of waters And the soft lashing of black waves For long and in loneliness. [I have heard the sunset song of the birches] “I have heard the sunset song of the birches “A white melody in the silence “I have seen a quarrel of the pines. “At nightfall “The little grasses have rushed by me “With the wind-men. “These things have I lived,” quoth the maniac, “Possessing only eyes and ears. “But, you— “You don green spectacles before you look at roses.” [Fast rode the knight] Fast rode the knight With spurs, hot and reeking Ever waving an eager sword. “To save my lady!” Fast rode the knight And leaped from saddle to war. Men of steel flickered and gleamed Like riot of silver lights And the gold of the knight's good banner Still waved on a castle wall. A horse Blowing, staggering, bloody thing Forgotten at foot of castle wall. A horse Dead at foot of castle wall. [Forth went the candid man] Forth went the candid man And spoke freely to the wind— When he looked about him he was in a far strange country. Forth went the candid man And spoke freely to the stars— Yellow light tore sight from his eyes. “My good fool,” said a learned bystander “Your operations are mad.” “You are too candid,” cried the candid man And when his stick left the head of the learned bystander It was two sticks. [You tell me this is God] You tell me this is God? I tell you this is a printed list, A burning candle and an ass. [On the desert] On the desert A silence from the moon's deepest valley. Fire-rays fall athwart the robes Of hooded men, squat and dumb. Before them, a woman Moves to the blowing of shrill whistles And distant-thunder of drums While slow things, sinuous, dull with terrible color Sleepily fondle her body Or move at her will, swishing stealthily over the sand. The snakes whisper softly; The whispering, whispering snakes Dreaming and swaying and staring But always whispering, softly whispering. The wind streams from the lone reaches Of Arabia, solemn with night, And the wild fire makes shimmer of blood Over the robes of the hooded men Squat and dumb. Bands of moving bronze, emerald, yellow, Circle the throat and the arms of her And over the sands serpents move warily Slow, menacing and submissive, Swinging to the whistles and drums, The whispering, whispering snakes, Dreaming and swaying and staring But always whispering, softly whispering. The dignity of the accursèd; The glory of slavery, despair, death Is in the dance of the whispering snakes. [A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices] A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices Which, bawled by boys from mile to mile, Spreads its curious opinion To a million merciful and sneering men, While families cuddle the joys of the fireside When spurred by tale of dire lone agony. A newspaper is a court Where every one is kindly and unfairly tried By a squalor of honest men. A newspaper is a market Where wisdom sells its freedom And melons are crowned by the crowd. A newspaper is a game Where his error scores the player victory While another's skill wins death. A newspaper is a symbol; It is fetless life's chronicle, A collection of loud tales Concentrating eternal stupidities, That in remote ages lived unhaltered, Roaming through a fenceless world. [The wayfarer] The wayfarer Perceiving the pathway to truth Was struck with astonishment. It was thickly grown with weeds. “Ha,” he said, “I see that none has passed here “In a long time.” Later he saw that each weed Was a singular knife. “Well,” he mumbled at last, “Doubtless there are other roads.” [A slant of sun on dull brown walls] A slant of sun on dull brown walls A forgotten sky of bashful blue. Toward God a mighty hymn A song of collisions and cries Rumbling wheels, hoof-beats, bells, Welcomes, farewells, love-calls, final moans, Voices of joy, idiocy, warning, despair, The unknown appeals of brutes, The chanting of flowers The screams of cut trees, The senseless babble of hens and wise men— A cluttered incoherency that says at the stars: “O, God, save us!” [Once a man clambering to the house-tops] Once a man clambering to the house-tops Appealed to the heavens. With strong voice he called to the deaf spheres; A warrior's shout he raised to the suns. Lo, at last, there was a dot on the clouds, And—at last and at last— —God—the sky was filled with armies. [There was a man with tongue of wood] There was a man with tongue of wood Who essayed to sing And in truth it was lamentable But there was one who heard The clip-clapper of this tongue of wood And knew what the man Wished to sing And with that the singer was content. [The successful man has thrust himself] The successful man has thrust himself Through the water of the years, Reeking wet with mistakes, Bloody mistakes, Slimed with victories over the lesser A figure thankful on the shore of money. Then, with the bones of fools He buys silken banners Limned with his triumphant face; With the skins of wise men He buys the trivial bows of all. Flesh painted with marrow Contributes a coverlet A coverlet for his contented slumber. In guiltless ignorance, in ignorant guilt He delivers his secrets to the riven multitude. “Thus I defended: Thus I wrought.” Complacent, smiling, He stands heavily on the dead. Erect on a pillar of skulls He declaims his trampling of babes; Smirking, fat, dripping, He makes speech in guiltless ignorance, Innocence. [In the night] In the night Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys And the peaks looked toward God, alone. “Oh, Master that movest the wind with a finger “Humble, idle, futile peaks are we. “Grant that we may run swiftly across the world “To huddle in worship at Thy feet.” In the morning A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles And the little black cities were apparent. “Oh, Master that knowest the meaning of rain-drops “Humble, idle, futile peaks are we. “Give voice to us we pray oh, Lord “That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun.” In the evening The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights. “Oh, Master “Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds “Thou hast made us humble, idle, futile peaks. “Thou only, needest eternal patience; “We bow to Thy wisdom, oh, Lord— “Humble, idle, futile peaks.” In the night Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys And the peaks looked toward God, alone. [The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top] The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top. Blood—blood and torn grass— Had marked the rise of his agony— This lone hunter. The grey-green woods impassive Had watched the threshing of his limbs. A canoe with flashing paddle A girl with soft searching eyes, A call: “John!” Come, arise, hunter! Can you not hear? The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top. [The impact of a dollar upon the heart] The impact of a dollar upon the heart Smiles warm red light Sweeping from the hearth rosily upon the white table, With the hanging cool velvet shadows Moving softly upon the door. The impact of a million dollars Is a crash of flunkeys And yawning emblems of Persia Cheeked against oak, France and a sabre, The outcry of old Beauty Whored by pimping merchants To submission before wine and chatter. Silly rich peasants stamp the carpets of men, Dead men who dreamed fragrance and light Into their woof, their lives; The rug of an honest bear Under the feet of a cryptic slave Who speaks always of baubles Forgetting place, multitude, work and state, Champing and mouthing of hats Making ratful squeak of hats, Hats. [A man said to the universe] A man said to the universe: “Sir, I exist!” “However,” replied the universe, “The fact has not created in me “A sense of obligation.” [When the prophet, a complacent fat man] When the prophet, a complacent fat man, Arrived at the mountain-top He cried: “Woe to my knowledge! “I intended to see good white lands “And bad black lands— “But the scene is grey.” [There was a land where lived no violets] There was a land where lived no violets. A traveller at once demanded: “Why?” The people told him: “Once the violets of this place spoke thus: “‘Until some woman freely gives her lover “‘To another woman “‘We will fight in bloody scuffle.’” Sadly the people added: “There are no violets here.” [There was one I met upon the road] There was one I met upon the road Who looked at me with kind eyes. He said: “Show me of your wares.” And I did, Holding forth one. He said: “It is a sin.” Then I held forth another. He said: “It is a sin.” Then I held forth another. He said: “It is a sin.” And so to the end. Always he said: “It is a sin.” At last, I cried out: “But I have none other.” He looked at me With kinder eyes. “Poor soul,” he said. [Aye, workman, make me a dream] Aye, workman, make me a dream A dream for my love. Cunningly weave sunlight, Breezes and flowers. Let it be of the cloth of meadows. And—good workman— And let there be a man walking thereon. [Each small gleam was a voice] Each small gleam was a voice —A lantern voice— In little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. A chorus of colors came over the water; The wondrous leaf-shadow no longer wavered, No pines crooned on the hills The blue night was elsewhere a silence When the chorus of colors came over the water, Little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. Small glowing pebbles Thrown on the dark plane of evening Sing good ballads of God And eternity, with soul's rest. Little priests, little holy fathers None can doubt the truth of your hymning When the marvelous chorus comes over the water Songs of carmine, violet, green, gold. [The trees in the garden rained flowers] The trees in the garden rained flowers. Children ran there joyously. They gathered the flowers Each to himself. Now there were some Who gathered great heaps— —Having opportunity and skill— Until, behold, only chance blossoms Remained for the feeble. Then a little spindling tutor Ran importantly to the father, crying: “Pray, come hither! “See this unjust thing in your garden!” But when the father had surveyed, He admonished the tutor: “Not so, small sage! “This thing is just. “For, look you, “Are not they who possess the flowers “Stronger, bolder, shrewder “Than they who have none? “Why should the strong— “—The beautiful strong— “Why should they not have the flowers?” Upon reflection, the tutor bowed to the ground. “My Lord,” he said, “The stars are displaced “By this towering wisdom.” [“INTRIGUE”] [Thou art my love] Thou art my love And thou art the peace of sundown When the blue shadows soothe And the grasses and the leaves sleep To the song of the little brooks Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a storm That breaks black in the sky And, sweeping headlong, Drenches and cowers each tree And at the panting end There is no sound Save the melancholy cry of a single owl Woe is me! Thou art my love And thou art a tinsel thing And I in my play Broke thee easily And from the little fragments Arose my long sorrow Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a weary violet Drooping from sun-caresses. Answering mine carelessly Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art the ashes of other men's love And I bury my face in these ashes And I love them Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art the beard On another man's face Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a temple And in this temple is an altar And on this altar is my heart Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a wretch. Let these sacred love-lies choke thee For I am come to where I know your lies as truth And your truth as lies Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a priestess And in thy hand is a bloody dagger And my doom comes to me surely Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art a skull with ruby eyes And I love thee Woe is me. Thou art my love And I doubt thee And if peace came with thy murder Then would I murder. Woe is me. Thou art my love And thou art death Aye, thou art death Black and yet black But I love thee I love thee Woe, welcome woe, to me. [Love forgive me if I wish you grief] Love forgive me if I wish you grief For in your grief You huddle to my breast And for it Would I pay the price of your grief. You walk among men And all men do not surrender And thus I understand That love reaches his hand In mercy to me. He had your picture in his room A scurvy traitor picture And he smiled —Merely a fat complacence Of men who know fine women— And thus I divided with him A part of my love. Fool, not to know that thy little shoe Can make men weep! —Some men weep. I weep and I gnash And I love the little shoe The little, little shoe. God give me medals God give me loud honors That I may strut before you, sweetheart And be worthy of— —The love I bear you. Now let me crunch you With full weight of affrighted love I doubted you —I doubted you— And in this short doubting My love grew like a genie For my further undoing. Beware of my friends Be not in speech too civil For in all courtesy My weak heart sees spectres, Mists of desires Arising from the lips of my chosen Be not civil. The flower I gave thee once Was incident to a stride A detail of a gesture But search those pale petals And see engraven thereon A record of my intention. [Ah, God, the way your little finger moved] Ah, God, the way your little finger moved As you thrust a bare arm backward And made play with your hair And a comb, a silly gilt comb Ah, God—that I should suffer Because of the way a little finger moved. [Once I saw thee idly rocking] Once I saw thee idly rocking —Idly rocking— And chattering girlishly to other girls, Bell-voiced, happy. Careless with the stout heart of unscarred womanhood And life to thee was all light melody: I thought of the great storms of love as I knew it Torn, miserable and ashamed of my open sorrow, I thought of the thunders that lived in my head And I wish to be an ogre And hale and haul my beloved to a castle And there use the happy cruel one cruelly And make her mourn with my mourning. [Tell me why, behind thee] Tell me why, behind thee, I see always the shadow of another lover? Is it real Or is this the thrice-damned memory of a better happiness? Plague on him if he be dead Plague on him if he be alive A swinish numskull To intrude his shade Always between me and my peace. [And yet I have seen thee happy with me] And yet I have seen thee happy with me. I am no fool To poll stupidly into iron. I have heard your quick breaths And seen your arms writhe toward me; At those times —God help us— I was impelled to be a grand knight, And swagger and snap my fingers, And explain my mind finely. Oh, lost sweetheart, I would that I had not been a grand knight. I said: “Sweetheart.” Thou said'st: “Sweetheart.” And we preserved an admirable mimicry Without heeding the drip of the blood From my heart. [I heard thee laugh] I heard thee laugh, And in this merriment I defined the measure of my pain; I knew that I was alone, Alone with love, Poor shivering love, And he, little sprite, Came to watch with me, And at midnight We were like two creatures by a dead camp-fire. [I wonder if sometimes in the dusk] I wonder if sometimes in the dusk, When the brave lights that gild thy evenings Have not yet been touched with flame, I wonder if sometimes in the dusk Thou rememberest a time, A time when thou loved me And our love was to thee thy all? Is the memory rubbish now? An old gown Worn in an age of other fashions? Woe is me, oh, lost one, For that love is now to me A supernal dream, White, white, white with many suns. [Love met me at noonday] Love met me at noonday, —Reckless imp, To leave his shaded nights And brave the glare,— And I saw him then plainly For a bungler, A stupid, simpering, eyeless bungler, Breaking the hearts of brave people As the snivelling idiot-boy cracks his bowl, And I cursed him, Cursed him to and fro, back and forth, Into all the silly mazes of his mind, But in the end He laughed and pointed to my breast, Where a heart still beat for thee, beloved. [I have seen thy face aflame] I have seen thy face aflame For love of me, Thy fair arms go mad, Thy lips tremble and mutter and rave. And—surely— This should leave a man content? Thou lovest not me now, But thou didst love me, And in loving me once Thou gavest me an eternal privilege, For I can think of thee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Uncollected Poems [“I'D RATHER HAVE—”] Last Christmas they gave me a sweater, And a nice warm suit of wool, But I'd rather be cold and have a dog, To watch when I come from school. Father gave me a bicycle, But that isn't much of a treat, Unless you have a dog at your heels Racing away down the street. They bought me a camping outfit, But a bonfire by a log Is all the outfit I would ask, If I only had a dog. They seem to think a little dog Is a killer of all earth's joys; But oh, that “pesky little dog” Means hours of joy to the boys. [Ah, haggard purse, why ope thy mouth] Ah, haggard purse, why ope thy mouth Like a greedy urchin I have nought wherewith to feed thee Thy wan cheeks have ne'er been puffed Thou knowest not the fill of pride Why then gape at me In fashion of a wronged one Thou do smile wanly And reproachest me with thine empty stomach Thou knowest I'd sell my steps to the grave If t'were but honestie. Ha, leer not so, Name me no names of wrongs committed with thee No ghost can lay hand on thee and me We've been too thin to do sin What, liar? When thou was filled of gold, didst I riot? And give thee no time to eat? No, thou brown devil, thou art stuffed now with lies as with wealth, The one gone to let in the other. [Little birds of the night] Little birds of the night Aye, they have much to tell Perching there in rows Blinking at me with their serious eyes Recounting of flowers they have seen and loved Of meadows and groves of the distance And pale sands at the foot of the sea And breezes that fly in the leaves. They are vast in experience These little birds that come in the night [A god came to a man] A god came to a man And said to him thus: “I have an apple “It is a glorious apple “Aye, I swear by my ancestors “Of the eternities before this eternity “It is an apple that is from “The inner thoughts of heaven's greatest. “And this I will hang here “And then I will adjust thee here “Thus—you may reach it. “And you must stifle your nostrils “And control your hands “And your eyes “And sit for sixty years “But,—leave be the apple.” The man answered in this wise: “Oh, most interesting God “What folly is this? “Behold, thou hast moulded my desires “Even as thou hast moulded the apple. “How, then? “Can I conquer my life “Which is thou? “My desires? “Look you, foolish god “If I thrust behind me “Sixty white years “I am a greater god than god “And, then, complacent splendor, “Thou wilt see that the golden angels “That sing pink hymns “Around thy throne-top “Will be lower than my feet.” [One came from the skies] One came from the skies —They said— And with a band he bound them A man and a woman. Now to the man The band was gold And to another, iron And to the woman, iron. But this second man, He took his opinion and went away But, by heavens, He was none too wise. [There is a grey thing that lives in the tree-tops] There is a grey thing that lives in the tree-tops None know the horror of its sight Save those who meet death in the wilderness But one is enabled to see To see branches move at its passing To hear at times the wail of black laughter And to come often upon mystic places Places where the thing has just been. [intermingled] intermingled, There come in wild revelling strains Black words, stinging That murder flowers The horror of profane speculation. [A soldier, young in years, young in ambitions] A soldier, young in years, young in ambitions Alive as no grey-beard is alive Laid his heart and his hopes before duty And went staunchly into the tempest of war. There did the bitter red winds of battle Swirl 'gainst his youth, beat upon his ambitions, Drink his cool clear blood of manhood Until at coming forth time He was alive merely as the grey-beard is alive. And for this— The nation rendered to him a flower A little thing—a flower Aye, but yet not so little For this flower grew in the nation's heart A wet, soft blossom From tears of her who loved her son Even when the black battle rages Made his face the face of furious urchin, And this she cherished And finally laid it upon the breast of him. A little thing—this flower? No—it was the flower of duty That inhales black smoke-clouds And fastens its roots in bloody sod And yet comes forth so fair, so fragrant— Its birth is sunlight in grimest, darkest place. [A row of thick pillars] A row of thick pillars Consciously bracing for the weight Of a vanished roof The bronze light of sunset strikes through them, And over a floor made for slow rites. There is no sound of singing But, aloft, a great and terrible bird Is watching a cur, beaten and cut, That crawls to the cool shadows of the pillars To die. [Chant you loud of punishments] Chant you loud of punishments, Of the twisting of the heart's poor strings Of the crash of the lightning's fierce revenge. Then sing I of the supple-souled men And the strong, strong gods That shall meet in times hereafter And the amaze of the gods At the strength of the men. —The strong, strong gods— —And the supple-souled men— [If you would seek a friend among men] If you would seek a friend among men Remember: they are crying their wares. If you would ask of heaven of men Remember: they are crying their wares. If you seek the welfare of men Remember: they are crying their wares. If you would bestow a curse upon men Remember: they are crying their wares. Crying their wares Crying their wares If you seek the attention of men Remember: Help them or hinder them as they cry their wares. [A lad and a maid at a curve in the stream] A lad and a maid at a curve in the stream And a shine of soft silken waters Where the moon-beams fall through a hemlock's boughs Oh, night dismal, night glorious. A lad and a maid at the rail of a bridge With two shadows adrift on the water And the wind sings low in the grass on the shore. Oh, night dismal, night glorious. A lad and a maid in a canoe, And a paddle making silver turmoil. [“LEGENDS”] [I. A man builded a bugle for the storms to blow] A man builded a bugle for the storms to blow. The focussed winds hurled him afar. He said that the instrument was a failure. [II. When the suicide arrived at the sky] When the suicide arrived at the sky, The people there asked him: “Why?” He replied: “Because no one admired me.” [III. A man said: “Thou tree!”] A man said: “Thou tree!” The tree answered with the same scorn: “Thou man! Thou art greater than I only in thy possibilities.” [IV. A warrior stood upon a peak and defied the stars] A warrior stood upon a peak and defied the stars. A little magpie, happening there, desired the soldier's plume, And so plucked it. [V. The wind that waves the blossoms] The wind that waves the blossoms Sang, sang, sang from age to age. The flowers were made curious by this joy. “Oh, wind,” they said, “why sing you at your labour, While we, pink beneficiaries, sing not, But idle, idle, idle from age to age?” [Oh, a rare old wine ye brewed for me] Oh, a rare old wine ye brewed for me Flagons of despair A deep deep drink of this wine of life Flagons of despair. Dream of riot and blood and screams The rolling white eyes of dying men The terrible heedless courage of babes [Tell me not in joyous numbers] Tell me not in joyous numbers We can make our lives sublime By—well, at least, not by Dabbling much in rhyme. [When a people reach the top of a hill] When a people reach the top of a hill Then does God lean toward them, Shortens tongues, lengthens arms. A vision of their dead comes to the weak. The moon shall not be too old Before the new battalions rise —Blue battalions— The moon shall not be too old When the children of change shall fall Before the new battalions —The blue battalions— Mistakes and virtues will be trampled deep A church and a thief shall fall together A sword will come at the bidding of the eyeless, The God-led, turning only to beckon. Swinging a creed like a censer At the head of the new battalions —Blue battalions— March the tools of nature's impulse Men born of wrong, men born of right Men of the new battalions —The blue battalions— The clang of swords is Thy wisdom The wounded make gestures like Thy Son's The feet of mad horses is one part, —Aye, another is the hand of a mother on the brow of a son. Then swift as they charge through a shadow, The men of the new battalions —Blue battalions— God lead them high. God lead them far Lead them far, lead them high These new battalions —The blue battalions—. [A man adrift on a slim spar] A man adrift on a slim spar A horizon smaller than the rim of a bottle Tented waves rearing lashy dark points The near whine of froth in circles. God is cold. The incessant raise and swing of the sea And growl after growl of crest The sinkings, green, seething, endless The upheaval half-completed. God is cold. The seas are in the hollow of The Hand; Oceans may be turned to a spray Raining down through the stars Because of a gesture of pity toward a babe. Oceans may become grey ashes, Die with a long moan and a roar Amid the tumult of the fishes And the cries of the ships, Because The Hand beckons the mice. A horizon smaller than a doomed assassin's cap, Inky, surging tumults A reeling, drunken sky and no sky A pale hand sliding from a polished spar. God is cold. The puff of a coat imprisoning air. A face kissing the water-death A weary slow sway of a lost hand And the sea, the moving sea, the sea. God is cold. [There exists the eternal fact of conflict] There exists the eternal fact of conflict And—next—a mere sense of locality. Afterward we derive sustenance from the winds. Afterward we grip upon this sense of locality. Afterward, we become patriots. The godly vice of patriotism makes us slaves, And—let us surrender to this falsity Let us be patriots Then welcome us the practical men Thrumming on a thousand drums The practical men, God help us. They cry aloud to be led to war Ah— They have been poltroons on a thousand fields And the sacked sad city of New York is their record Furious to face the Spaniard, these people, and crawling worms before their task They name serfs and send charity in bulk to better men They play at being free, these people of New York Who are too well-dressed to protest against infamy. [On the brown trail] On the brown trail We hear the grind of your carts To our villages, Laden with food Laden with food We know you are come to our help But— Why do you impress upon us Your foreign happiness? We know it not. (Hark! Carts laden with food Laden with food) We weep because we don't understand But your gifts form into a yoke The food turns into a yoke (Hark! Carts laden with food Laden with food) It is our mission to vanish Grateful because of full mouths Destiny—Darkness Time understands And ye—ye bigoted men of a moment— —Wait— Await your turn. [Rumbling, buzzing, turning, whirling Wheels] Rumbling, buzzing, turning, whirling Wheels, Dizzy Wheels! Wheels! [“THE BATTLE HYMN”] All-feeling God, hear in the war-night The rolling voices of a nation; Through dusky billows of darkness See the flash, the under-light, of bared swords— —Whirling gleams like wee shells Deep in the streams of the universe— Bend and see a people, O, God, A people rebuked, accursed, By him of the many lungs And by him of the bruised weary war-drum (The chanting disintegrate and the two-faced eagle) Bend and mark our steps, O, God. Mark well, mark well, Father of the Never-Ending Circles And if the path, the new path, lead awry Then in the forest of the lost standards Suffer us to grope and bleed apace For the wisdom is Thine. Bend and see a people, O, God, A people applauded, acclaimed, By him of the raw red shoulders The manacle-marked, the thin victim (He lies white amid the smoking cane) —And if the path, the new path, leads straight— Then—O, God—then bare the great bronze arm; Swing high the blaze of the chained stars And let them look and heed (The chanting distintegrate and the two-faced eagle) For we go, we go in a lunge of a long blue corps And—to Thee we commit our lifeless sons, The convulsed and furious dead. (They shall be white amid the smoking cane) For, the seas shall not bar us; The capped mountains shall not hold us back We shall sweep and swarm through jungle and pool, Then let the savage one bend his high chin To see on his breast, the sullen glow of the death-medals For we know and we say our gift. His prize is death, deep doom. (He shall be white amid the smoking cane.) [Unwind my riddle] Unwind my riddle. Cruel as hawks the hours fly, Wounded men seldom come home to die, The hard waves see an arm flung high, Scorn hits strong because of a lie, Yet there exists a mystic tie. Unwind my riddle. [A naked woman and a dead dwarf] A naked woman and a dead dwarf; Wealth and indifference. Poor dwarf! Reigning with foolish kings And dying mid bells and wine Ending with a desperate comic palaver While before thee and after thee Endures the eternal clown— —The eternal clown— A naked woman. [A grey and boiling street] A grey and boiling street Alive with rickety noise. Suddenly, a hearse, Trailed by black carriages Takes a deliberate way Through this chasm of commerce; And children look eagerly To find the misery behind the shades. Hired men, impatient, drive with a longing To reach quickly the grave-side, the end of solemnity. Yes, let us have it over. Drive, man, drive. Flog your sleek-hided beasts, Gallop—gallop—gallop. Let us finish it quickly. [Bottles and bottles and bottles] Bottles and bottles and bottles In a merry den And the wan smiles of women Untruthing license and joy. Countless lights Making oblique and confusing multiplication In mirrors And the light returns again to the faces. A cellar, and a death-pale child. A woman Ministering commonly, degradedly, Without manners. A murmur and a silence Or silence and a murmur And then a finished silence. The moon beams practically upon the cheap bed. An hour, with its million trinkets of joy or pain, Matters little in cellar or merry den Since all is death. [The patent of a lord] The patent of a lord And the bangle of a bandit Make argument Which God solves Only after lighting more candles. [My cross!] My cross! Your cross? The real cross Is made of pounds, Dollars or francs. Here I bear my palms for the silly nails To teach the lack —The great pain of lack— Of coin.</field>
