      <field name="fulltext">Dedication. TO A MEMORY SACRED FOREVER, THIS VOLUME IS NOW INSCRIBED. APRIL, 1881. When last the maple bud was swelling, When last the crocus bloom'd below, Thy heart to mine its love was telling, Thy soul with mine kept ebb and flow:â Again the maple bud is swelling, Again the crocus blooms below; In heaven thy heart its love is telling, But still our souls keep ebb and flow. When last the April bloom was flinging Sweet odors on the air of Spring, In forest-aisles thy voice was ringing, Where thou with bird and brook didst sing:â Again the April bloom is flinging Sweet odors on the air of Spring; But now in heaven thy voice is ringing, Where thou dost with the angels sing. April 1854. I. Miami Woods. Well known to me is every alley green, Dingle, and bushy dell, in this wild wood, And every bosky bourn from side to side, My daily walk, and ancient neighborhood. Milton: âComus.â A solitary sorrow, antheming A lonely grief. Keats: âHyperion.â Proem. Miami Woods!âWhat says the mighty Past To the still mightier Present, from the midst Of all these vestiges of centuries gone, That strew the plains and hills around? I ask The question thousands have thus asked before, And get the common answerâecho! Here, Green on the crown'd acclivities, or dark In the dim twilight of o'erarching trees That clothe the valleys, we behold remains Of human toil and triumph and dismay, O'er which the oak that counts five hundred years Spreads his protecting branches:âwalls of earth; Tlascalan gateways; sacrificial mounds; The altars of a worship we know not; And, beautiful in their silence, tombs of men Who died before the parent tree had cast The seed from which arose this hoary trunk, That lies so low at last! But though the eye Meets these rude records, turn where'er it will, They tell no story that is understood, Of all the human love and hate and pride, And all the joy, and strife and agony, That once were known within these Sylvan homes, So populous then, so void and silent now: And vainly leans the listening ear to catch A sound or syllable revealing more Than these mute records to the eye disclose. Pierce far into the depths of these old woods, Where seem to meet the Present and the Past; Hasten not hence, but with still lingering steps Move to and fro; stand on the tumulus That rises o'er a chieftain's ashes; trace The circle and the square, which still remain Distinct and beautiful; with reverent step Approach the altar where of old were lit The fires of sacrifice; snatch from its sleep Of centuries, beneath the pregnant earth, The sculptured image; and then question all. âQuestion as well the winds, or waves! as well The child that's with me here, as wise as I! How silent, where a hundred tongues should speak, If curiosity had but the power To bid and be obeyed: how silent all! There comes down from the Past no voice to tell The tale so often asked. The Present points To these rude works alone, and they are mute. E'en the high chambers of the tumuli, In which were laid the bones of chiefs and kings Who ruled here in the ages lost, withhold The revelation sought. The marvelous skill And learning that in other lands have read The secrets of the Past on images, On stones, and on the corpses of the dead Exhumed from the repose of centuries, Read nothing here. The garrulous tongue of Time âTime, that has hung the forests round like clouds Upon the hillsides: Time, that here has cut Grooves in the rocks which antedate the pits Hewn in the hills of Latium for the first Foundations of old Rome,âthroughout these wilds Makes not a sign, and syllables no sound, To break the eternal seal that rests on all! So let it be! Why seek to know what God, In his inscrutable ways, has hidden thus? It may be wise such mysteries to explore; To probe the Past for what it holds so dark; But in familiar things that lie along Our daily walks, are lessons for us all: And he who seeks the profit of his soul In free communings with the things that speak Most reverently of God on earth, may ask The Present with humility, and find In all about him revelations deep, As I do now, here in Miami Woods. Part First. 1839. The autumn time is with us!âIts approach Was heralded, not many days ago, By hazy skies that veiled the brazen sun, And sea-like murmurs from the rustling corn, And low-voiced brooks that wandered drowsily By pendent clusters of empurpling grapes Swinging upon the vine. And now, 'tis here! And what a change hath pass'd upon the face Of nature, where the waving forest spreads, Then robed in deepest green! All through the night The subtle frost has plied its magic art; And in the day the golden sun hath wrought True wonders; and the winds of morn and even Have touch'd with magic breath the changing leaves. And now, as wanders the dilating eye Athwart the varied landscape, circling far, What gorgeousness, what blazonry, what pomp Of colors, bursts upon the ravished sight! Here, where the poplar rears its yellow crest, A golden glory; yonder, where the oak Stands monarch of the forest, and the ash Is girt with flame-like parasite, and broad The dogwood spreads beneath, and, fringing all, The sumac blushes to the ground, a flood Of deepest crimson; and afar, where looms The gnarlÃ¨d gum, a cloud of bloodiest red; While, intermix'd, maples of various hues, Scarlet and gold, and delicate streaks of pink And purple blotches curiously wrought, Inwoven with rich orange traceries And dash'd with carmine, take the wandering eye With ravishment, and dazzle at each glance:â All quiet, in the calm of noon that now Scarce floats the thistle's down, or stirs the leaf Of tallest aspen on its poising stem,â But toss'd against the blue-wall'd heavens, anon And streaming in the fitful breezes, like Banners and bannerets tumultuous borne In conflict o'er the deadly battle-field! Out in the woods of Autumn! I have cast Aside the shackles of the town, that vex The fetterless soul, and come to hide myself, Miami! in thy venerable shades. Here where seclusion looks out on a scene Of matchless beauty, I will pause awhile, And on this bank with varied mosses crown'd Gently recline. The forest has a voice That comes to me with memories of her Who bore me; and the beauty of the scene Brings recollections up of some who here Roam'd with me in my boyhood, who now walk The ways of life no more: a thousand thoughts Press on me, mingled with regretful pangs For slight unkindnesses, not thought of then, That now reproach me. What has been, thus haunts What is. I feel the present and the past Around me and within me. Earth is old, And new; and so the heart, which is my world. Far in the quiet woodland! The calm sky Looks smilingly upon me, and the air Comes laden with the sweets of autumn time, And living with the murmurs of the bee, And insect tribes. Around me on the slopes The aster blooms, and in the valley waves The golden-rod. Beneath me, silver-bright, Glide the calm waters, with a plaintive moan For summer's parting glories. High o'erhead, Seeking the sedgy brinks of still lagoons That bask in southern suns the winter through, Sails tireless the unerring waterfowl, Screaming among the cloud-racks. Oft from where, In bushy covert hid, the partridge stands, Bursts suddenly the whistle clear and loud, Far-echoing through the dim wood's fretted aisles. Deep murmurs from the trees, bending with brown And ripened mast, are interrupted oft By sounds of dropping nuts; and warily The turkey from the thicket comes, and swift As flies an arrow darts the pheasant down, To batten on the autumn; and the air, At times, is darkened by a sudden rush Of myriad wings, as the wild pigeon leads His squadrons to the banquet. Far away, Where tranquil groves on sunny slopes supply Their liberal store of fruits, the merry laugh Of children, and the truant school-boy's shout, Ring on the air, as, from the hollows borne, Nuts load their creaking carts, and lush pawpaws Their motley baskets fill, with clustering grapes And golden-sphered parsimmons spread o'er all. Deep in the solemn forest! From the tops Of these old trees, swept by the evening wind, Which swells among their leaves, and dies away, And gathers strength again, float softly down Strange, wild, deep harmonies. And I have been All day among the Voices of the Wood, That are but echoes of perpetual tones With which God fills the universe. The noon, Gairish and still, and midnight's calm repose, And dewy eve, and fresh, rejoicing morn, Are full of them. I hear them in the breeze That stirs the reed to music: in the faint, Sad murmur of the stream that glides below, Bearing away the fallen leaves, as pass The dreams of childhood and the hopes of life, I hear them: and I hear them in the spring That, bubbling from beneath yon moss-clad root, Falls tinkling o'er the shimmering rock below: And in the billowy chimes that wake aloft When freshening winds sweep through the ancient trees, They speak with organ-tones, that reach the depths Stirring within me, and an echo find In the roused soul. ... O God! Thou art in all I now behold! the essence and the life, The germ and the vitality! the birth, The being, and the end! else Reason gropes In darkness all her days, and knowledge dies. What but the high intelligence, the hand Almighty, and the sempiternal lifeâ What but the omnipresence, and the will, All which we feel thou art, and all that fills Our great Idea of a primal cause, And fix'd design beyond the power of chance To change or check, could speak this glorious world From wildest Chaos and profoundest Night? What poise the planets in the void, and set The infinite stars in order, and confine Each in its separate path on high? What fill Earth with its countless forms of Life, and raise Eternally, as ages glide along, New being from the ashes of decay? Alone, with God and Nature, and this child In whom I witness both.âAround me now Is pressing onward the unceasing change. And here, amid the thick-strewn vestiges Of many centuries, whose paths are seen Where time has worn these hollows in the hills, And after beautified the ruin wrought With all this growth of interlacing trees, I contemplate the mysteries sublime Of birth, and life, and death! .. From the dark womb Of winter comes the spring with mild, warm breath; And instantly the chains that bound the streams Are loosened, and the waters leap to light, And shout with gladness. Soon the spell that long Has held the earth, is broken; and the grass Pierces the sod, and from the sheltering leaves That strew the ground, look out the fresh young flowers, Smiling to heaven. Then the gray, leafless trees, Long desolate in their utter nakedness, Feel the new presence; and although no sign Of life is visible, a delicate green Creeps out along the tender twigs, where swell The germ-infolding buds, and in the warm And sunny day, and through the breezy night, Come forth the myriad leaves, courting the light And wantoning with the zephyr, till a robe Of brightest green bursts on the wondering eye. O'er the cold bosom of the sluggish clod Soon steals the influence; and from the broad And seeded field shoots up the waving grain, Till spreads a sea of verdure far around, Toss'd by the winds, and with the clouds at play. Then comes the long and sunny summer time, And for the garners of the husbandman Ripens, and to the sickle lays, the grain; And for the cherish'd tribes of air, that make The cool groves vocal, strews the briary slope With berries; and for the innumerous flocks That shun the haunts of men, and hang their nests High in the endless wood, or in the low Dark thicket build, matures the beechen mast; And takes the worm upon the leaf, and wraps A silken tissue round it; and prepares For many an insect race befitting tombs, Where each shall sleep the winter hours away. Then comes the lone and quiet autumn on, With tinkling waterfalls, and moaning woods, And arid wastes o'er which the night winds sigh. And this is here; and now the flower hath closed And cast its petals, and the naked stalk Stands shriveling in the frost; the feathered grass Is heavy in the head; the painted leaf Flies twittering on the wind; and to the earth Falls the brown nut, with melancholy sound. Yet the low, moaning autumn wind, that sweeps The seeded grass and lately-blossoming flower, Bears the light germs of future life away, And sows them by the gliding rivulet, And o'er the plain, and on the mountain-side, To clothe anew the earth, when comes again The quickening breath of spring. And on the place Where fall the ripened nuts, the frosty night Will heap the stricken leaves; and thence shall spring, In many an after age, another growth Of stately trees, when those around me now, Fallen with eld, shall moulder, and enrich The ground that now sustains their lofty pride. Changing, forever changing!âSo depart The glories of the old, majestic wood; So pass the pride and garniture of fields, The growth of ages, and the bloom of days, Into the dust of centuries; and so Are both renewed. The scattered tribes of men, The generations of the populous earth, All have their seasons too. And jocund Youth Is the green springtimeâManhood's lusty strength Is the maturing summerâhoary Age Types well the autumn of the yearâand Death Is the real winter, which forecloses all. âAnd shall the forests have another spring, And shall the fields another garland wear, And shall the worm come forth renewed in life And clothed upon with beauty, and not man? No!âin the Book before me now, I read Another language; and my faith is sure, That though the chains of death may hold it long, This mortal will o'ermaster them, and break Away, and put on immortality. Almighty Father! such the lesson is, That, in these cool and venerable woods, Amid the relics of a mighty Past, From which look out the strong and swelling germs Of a still mightier Future,âFather, such Is the great lesson that I read to-day, With love and awe; and firmer in my breast, By every syllable, these truths are fixed: That Thou art the beginning, and the end, Of all this wondrous work; and that Thy love Pervades the universe; and that Thy smile Seeketh all hearts to sun them; and that Thou In every glorious thing we here behold, Declarest and reveal'st Thyself to be The Majesty SupremeâEternal God. Part Second. 1844. After long-wandering in the crowded streets Of busy cities, where Humanity Is least and greatest; after gay saloons, And soft, seductive luxuries, and forms Languidly beautiful, and oft-heard tones Have pall'd upon the senses; what delight Steals o'er the spirit, in the beautiful haunts Of Nature, 'mid the silence, and the shade, And low, sweet murmurs from the earth and air, And all the holy influences that come With blessÃ©d gleams of the blue heavens above! Society grows stale, and men become Not what they were, or seemed to be. We changeâ All change, both to each other, and ourselves. Our habitudes, our passions, our delights, Are ever mutable. But in these shades, Amid these venerable trees, beneath Yon blue o'erarching canopy, where'er The unshorn majesty of Nature reigns, There is a glorious, an abounding joy, Forever. Not to haunts like these belong The pallid cheek, the sickly frame, the roll Of feelings grown untimely old:âBut you, Ye wild and wooded hills, ye flowery dales That stretch between and bask in light, ye rocks O'er which the cool springs trickle, and ye clear And flashing rivulets, that run along And murmur to the winds, which murmur back, âAudible voices of the Deity! âVisible impress of Almighty Power! âBright, bland expression of Creative Love! Ye still are new and beautiful: and still Within your calm and unpolluted depths The thoughts are fresh, and springy limb doth long Retain its elasticity, the heart Broods not and sickens not o'er ills that fast Beget each other, and the feelings know An almost perpetuity of youth. Far-seated in these mighty groves, I hear The solemn Anthem of the Centuries Roll up, as if the Majesty of God Swept o'er the Universe, and spoke: the low, Deep plaint of millions that have lived, and toil'd, And died, in bondageâthe despairing cry Of struggling hearts that pour'd their torrents out, And sank exhausted down beneath the hard And crushing heel of tyrannyâthe sweet, Sad interludes of mercy, and of loveâ The glad songs of deliveranceâthe thick And smothered voice of hateâthe taunt of scornâ The terrible threat of vengeanceâthe intense Though whispered oaths that league determined men, And know no revocationâand, o'er all, The exulting shout of Freedom from the hills, And from the plains, and from the empurpled seas! And then peals out from billowy chimes of thought, A wild, irregular song, that has such tune As the sea sings with, and a symphony Like unto that which gales from Labrador Pipe in the shrouds when waves roll mountain high. 1. Lift up your hearts, oh men! From the long sorrow that has weigh'd them down: Eternal Justice, from her starry height, Stoops earthward through the dusk of centuries, To poise anew the balance that shall weigh Henceforth the relative rights Of master and of man, Of ten and of ten thousand, here on earth. Lift up your weary hearts!â Rejoice! rejoice! Weighed in the scales, Oppression kicks the beam. 2. Wrong liveth not for aye! 'Tis not immortal, as is common Right: Right and the Truth exist eternally, But Wrong and Falsehood perish day by day; They perish by their own inherent illâ While Truth, with brow serene, Lives in immortal bloom; And Right, though baffled oft, in many ways, Rises and reigns at last.â Rejoice! rejoice! Wrong cometh to its fall, as God is good. 3. Lift up your hearts, oh men! Stretch forth the arm, and try its unused strength; Plant the foot firmly on the galling chain; Brace every sinew to its utmost power; Now with invincible will each muscle clothe:â Ha! how the fetters fall! Was thisâwas this a slave? It looks so like a MAN, 'tis hard to think It other than a man!â Rejoice! rejoice! The Man ascends: the King comes to the dust. A wild, hoarse song, but truthful.âAs from out The laboring bosom of the Carib Sea, Isle after isle has sprung, rooted in rock And ribb'd with adamant, which even now Are to each other reaching out strong arms, That yet shall clasp, and firmly interlace, And circle into states confederate, The beauty and the wonder of the world: So, from the great profound of Thought, comes up Truth after truth, compact and luminous, Which, each with each uniting, intertwine, Till, girt with principle and grooved in right, Broad systems form that are the strength of man And bulwarks of his freedom.âWe behold Cycle and epicycle rounding back Into infinitude. We cannot see The end from the beginning. Only this With something like assurance stamps itself Upon the mind: that the great cycle of all, In which these cycles move, starts from the base In an ascending grade that knows no check, Runs circle after circle, never joined, And strengthens to the summit. This supplies Larger and larger fields for man, and gives The soul that larger freedom which it seeks, And has sought from the first, continually: And with the larger freedom, still must come The larger forms it covets, and with these The full enfranchisement of man, which is The aim and the attainment of the Soul: For full enfranchisement is faith, and love, And charity, and peace o'er all the earth. Hope is from Heaven: then let man not despair! The Plan of the Eternal moves right on: It knows no ebbâit makes no pauseâit has No Ajalon. The cycles fill the void, In the great Cycle upward moving still, And resting in Perfection, full-attained Here and Hereafterânot in either state Alone, but in both only.âMen despair, Sicken and die, believing that the base, Unscrupulous arts by which their fellow men O'erreach each other, must destroy the poise Of Right forever, and to chaos back Hurl frail Humanity. But God's high scheme Depends not on contingencies like these: Men, the poor instruments, may fail in faith Among themselves, and lack fidelity To truth, to justice, mercy, love, and all That human reason deems essential: yet, God overrules each wrong for right, and still The great design moves on and on, while all Who falter, perish in their faithlessness. This is the lesson Meditation reads, Sitting in solitude on mossy rocks, Or walking hand in hand with Nature, here In her great temples, arch'd with heaven's own blue, And pillared with the majesty of trees That have the strength of centuries.âTo one Who in these quiet halls is far removed From human passions, vain desires, the throes Of party, and the conflicts of the field, How paltry, wicked, miserable, mean, Seem the contentions of society! Turn, thou whose ears have drunk the jarring sounds Of wrangling tongues, in crowded thoroughfares And busy martsâor thou whose eyes have looked On the red battle-field, and there beheld The quivering limb, the writhing countenance, The blackened and the putrifying corpseâ Turn from all this, which liker is to hell Than to aught else, and with thy soul commune, Here in the quiet of Miami Woods. âLook out upon the bordering fields, where spreads The yellow wheat, and waves the tasseling corn; Look in, where the great heart of Nature beats Steadily, peacefully, ever full of love; Look down, at the sweet flowers that clothe the ground, Blooming for all, and giving thankfully Their perfume for the light that visits them; Look up, at the blue heavens that bend o'er all, Serene, and beautiful, and grand, and good: Then, if thou wonderest, ask this little child, Whose soul is awed to silence, what there is In all this scene, that thou should'st thus be call'd From the great world where beats the human heart In all its power, and she will answerââGod, And God's own peace, and majesty, and strength!â âIn such a Presence, bend thy stubborn neck, And stand uncovered. God, not man, is here; Nature, not art; dissimulation not, But frankness; falsehood never, only truth. And if thou go not hence a better man, Pray fervently for helpâfor thou hast need. Sage monitors of youth are wont to say The eye grows early dim to nature's charms, And commerce with the world soon dulls the ear To heavenliest sounds. It may be so; but I, Whose feet were on the hills from earliest life, And in the vales, and by the flashing brooks, Have not so found it:âdeeper in my heart, Deeper and deeper year by year, has sunk The love of nature, in my close, and long, And fond companionship with woods and waves, With birds and breezes, with the starry sky, The mountain-height, the rocky gorge, the slope Mantled with flow'rs, and the far-reaching plain That mingles with the heavens. It is not soâ It is not so save where the ear grows dull To God's own voice, and the averted eye, Thick film'd with sin, is darkened thus, and lost To all his visible glory. The green fields Are studded with their golden buttons still, And living with their gilded butterflies, That pass not unobserved. The rocky pool, In which the robin bathes his dusky plumes, The tufted flow'rs that smile beyond, the slope That from its margin greenly steals away To bordering woodlands fill'd with airy tongues, Still lure us from the hot and dusty road As in the years gone by. There come at morn, From the cool groves and from the orchards round, The same sweet songs of birds that charm'd the ear Of childhood, and of youth; and in the eve Floats up from the broad meadows still, the same Sweet smell of new-made hay. Day and the Sun In all his gloryâNight and all she hath Of beauty, or of mystery, or joy, Still hold their spell upon the heart, and fill The soul with wonder and with awe. The earth Fades not, and fails not in its wealth of charms:â We seek them now, as in our earliest years, And find them: we plunge far into the woods, And roam the flowery fields, and climb the hills, Not less the child that we are more the man: We loiter where the waters of the brook Dance down the pebbly slope, and watch the leaf Or feather that is on its bosom borne, Till lost to sight: the little hand that scoop'd The cool wave up in childhood, larger grown, Needs now no prompting, but supplies the draught To thirsty lip or heated forehead. Now, As then, we marvel at the growing grass, And at the blooming flower, and at the tree That rises up and pierces the blue sky Among the clouds. The high heav'n-spanning arch, That evening builds when storm has roll'd away And dies far east, the purple sunset's hue, The unmatch'd iris of the humming-bird, The rose's cup, the lily's silver bell, The blue-eyed violetâall sights and sounds That won the eye or charm'd the ear in youth, Are living still. Eternal beauty dies Within man's heart but through eternal sin, Or with annihilation. He who has The love of right, the fear of wrong, the hate And scorn of evil, multiform and darkâ Who hearkens to the still small voice withinâ Who hourly bids the hourly tempter backâ Who loves his fellow-menâwho leaves to Heav'n The judgment of his enemies: not to him, Not to his eye, not to his ear, will God Willingly suffer the glad sights and sounds Of nature to grow dim, or to become Inaudible. Years change us not so much, Nor commerce with the world; but groveling thoughts, Vaulting ambitions, unrepressed desires, Whose oft-indulgence blunts the edge of youth: These early dim the eye to nature's charms, And early dull the ear to heavenliest sounds. My thoughts, exultant o'er the strides of time, Flow as they list in novel cadences.â A cheerful melody, learned long ago, But half forgotten now, comes stealing up Among remembered tones of other years, And breaks in fitful murmurs from my lips:â To this the currents of my musing flow 1. How lightly on yon wave the wild duck sits, Now floating with the current, and anon Eddying the drowsy hours of noon away Where minnows sport, and where The lushest sedges grow!â So lightly sits the youth upon my heart. 2. How brightly yet, down this sequestered dell, Lie the cool drops of rain that fell last night, In the leaf's hollow and the wildflower's cup, Though the hot, scorching sun, Has been for hours athirst!â So brightly lies the youth upon my heart. 3. How fondly unto yon high tree, that lifts Its folds from chilling shadows to the sun, And there supports them when the tempests rage, Clings the dependent vine, By every tendril clings!â So fondly clings the youth unto my heart. 4. How sweetly on this knoll the sunshine rests, Filling with joy the moss's wondrous cup, And calling violets, bluer than the sky, From their long winter sleep, To bless the earth again!â So sweetly rests the youth upon my heart. 5. How freshly lies, within the sweet embrace Of these encircling hills, whose flowery slopes Stretch to its marge, this clear and shining pool, Whose waters ever flow From yon half hidden rock!â So freshly lies the youth within my heart. A simple melody, got long ago: A cheerful thought, more difficult to learn.â So lightly, fondly, sweetly, freshly lies The youth within my heart: so rest it there! 'Tis only feeling makes us old: our years But bear us toward the grave. We all must die, But must not all grow old, except in years. âThe groves, whose beauty and whose music stole Into my wondering spirit long ago, Were ne'er more beautiful than now, were ne'er More musical. I come and walk the ways Of boyhood, and I find the flowers the same: I pause, and sit in old familiar seats, And see no change, save that the gathering mold Is greener, and that now upon them press Mosses and lichens of a few more years.â The youth is in the heart of Nature, too! Beautiful, beautiful Youth!âFreshness is youth, And truthfulness is youth, and innocence: And faith, and love, and joyousness are youth: Whatever undistorted stands, and wears The impress and the glow with which at first It came from God, is panoplied in youth. It gathers not the dust of timeâit takes No tarnish from the earthâbut walks abroad Effulgent with the glory of its Source, And trailing robes of beauty evermore. My soul is full; and from its stirring depths, Oh, beautiful young heart! whose tendrils cling So closely round my own, flow, overflow, These fervent strains to thine:â 1. Child of my love! Count it a blessing that thou also art The child of Nature, and the lineal heir Of all the wealth of charms that she bestows Upon her votaries 2. The morning air, That to thy chamber, ere thou art awake, Comes with cool lips, fresh-bathed in meadowy dews, And kisses thy young cheek; the choral songs, That on the freshening breeze, from ringing groves, Float sweetly up and sing thee from thy sleep; The glittering grass, that in the sun's first beam Mimics the midnight heav'ns; the holy calm That, like a blessed influence from God, Prompts thy young heart to prayer: these, loved one, these Are of thy heritage. 3. The solemn hush Of summer noons,âwhen o'er the city sweeps, Sirocco-like, each fitful breath of air, Till men sink down exhausted, and for hours, In languid half-repose, fond mothers lie And fan their suffering infants,âcomes to thee With cheerful gleams of blue and peaceful skies, And quiet whispers from sweet pebbly brooks, That glide along in shadow, mingled oft With drowsy murmurs, in the sunny air, Of many insect tribes, and fitful songs From dark ancestral cedars stealing out, Where wearied wings are folded. Blessed lot! Which thou inheritest, and dost possess, As Nature's child and mine. 4. Thine is the eve Of healthful breezes that come freshening up From springy dells and wooded wild ravines, From broad, clear rivers, where they've kiss'd the wave And stolen its coolness, and from pastoral slopes Alive with herds, whose breath they've gathered up In all its sweetness, and now bring to thee. The oriole greets thee from his hanging bower; The sparrow sings for thee; the southern wren Echoes the cardinal's resounding notes; The catbird leads the Vespers sweetly on, Till sets the sun; and then the hermit thrush, Quiet all day in far-off thickets, comes Nearer at night's approach, and pours his soul In ravishing melodies, till all the air Is living with his spirit. 5. And thine the night, All starr'd with glory, and all fill'd with tones That come down from the Infinite, and link Our being with the elder-born of Time, Eternity, Existence uncreate: Voices that speak in dreams, or memories, Or consciousness yet faint and undefined, Of Pre-existenceâstates, conditions, forms, That are not now, but whither we are borne, To the Inevitable and the Doom, May be again, or not, as now and here We haply win or lose. 6. Child of my love! Oh, count it fortunate thou art the child Of Nature also. To this double bond Be faithful. Coming years will tempt thee soreâ But in the trials and the triumphs Life May have in store for thee, forget thou not The haunts wherein thy childhood met with love, And peace, and beauty; where in tranquil ways Thy chafing spirit thou didst often soothe; And where, as thy young heart has felt, God walked With Nature and with thee. Part Third. 1851. The spring is here, an ever-welcome joy, With all its gifts of leaf, and bud, and flower, And all its wealth of breeze, and bird, and song: And I am with the springâa sharer free In all the sweet delights she brings from heaven, And scatters o'er the earth with liberal hand. How grateful are these haunts, up into which I now ascend, to one whose spirit chafes Amid the din of cities, where so much That is the work of human hands appears, And where remains so little that was God's! Above me, patches of blue sky are shown; Below, mosaic-plats reach far away, Of varied mosses made, and shining grass, And early flowers, lit up by quivering flakes Of sun that, struggling through the swaying trees, Fall warm to earth; while scattered all around, Where openings give the breeze and sun free play, Are sweet-briar clumps, and natural arbors made By wild-grapes clambering over dogwood tops, And trailing thence to earth. About my brow, Drying the locks which the long winding walk Has moistened, freshly play soft meadowy winds, That bear the violet's breath from sunny nooks, And from the blossoms of the pendant vine Steal odors sweeter than the spicy airs Of Eden, that revisit us in dreams. Clear, purling rills, that lave the calamus-root, And gently glide among the mint and cress, Then dance and sparkle where the pebbly bed Slopes to the brimming pool, sing o'er again The songs of Siloa's brook, erst heard of old By prophets in the groves of Palestine. Nor wind and wave alone; but all the wide Green wood is voiceful; and from fretted roof, And groined arch, rolls out an anthem sound, Whose clear, deep tones, make these primeval halls, Spreading in many-pillared majesty, Holy and beautiful. .... Eternal God! Thanks for the freshness of the early spring! Thanks for the flowers in unfrequented ways That bud and bloom! and for the feathered tribes Which dart like arrows by, and fill the groves With melody! and for the towering trees That wall this temple in, ânot made with hands,â In which I worship! Thanks, Supremest Good, For the soft airs that blow upon me now! And for the sunny hills and grassy plains O'er which they wander, like the murmuring bee, Gathering all subtle essences at will! And for all sights, and sounds, and perfumes sweet, That make the ecstasy which here I feel, Accept these thanks, O Father. ... I am here, Again, Miami! mid the holy calm That in the soul of thy vast solitude Reigns ever, save when broken by the rush Of tempests, or the harsh and terrible tones Of thunder, that with arrowy lightnings come And pierce thy still recesses. I am hereâ The same, yet not the same, as when at first, In mild, reflective mood, and artless verse, I sang thy charms, and lifted from their midst My heart to God. The same, yet not the same: For on the dial-plate of Life, since then, The shadow of my quickly rounding years Has numbered twelve. And I have wandered far, And much have seen of glory and of grief; And much have known of pleasure and of pain; And much have thought of human pride and pomp, Which are the sorriest and baldest things The indulgent eye of Heaven looks down upon. The same, yet not the same: three cherub forms Have lain within my partner's breast, since then, That now lie in the earthâthree birdlings fair Sung on my knee, that sing in heaven now. And one who oftenest wandered with me here, The wildest and the merriest that then Had blessed our love and hope, in whom I saw Renewed the freshness of my youth, and felt Again its mantling bloom, in darkness now And dreariness is whelm'd, by sad eclipse Of reason, and attending woes that wear The body thin, and vex the spirit. Here, Haply, she may not come again; but here, In her bright youth and all-abounding love, She'll live with me forever, though the gloom That wraps her now mysterious Providence May ne'er dispel. The same, yet not the same: 'T was Autumn then in thy deep heart, which mourn'd Its summer glories, passing fast away; But in my own, perpetual fountains played, And to perpetual hopes, that clustered there, Gave brightest bloom. But Autumn now has come To my bereavÃ¨d heart, which inly moans For withered hopes and blighted flowers of love, While thine is full of gushing melodies, And sunniest slopes, and green and bloomy nooks. Sorrow is not despair, but rather hope:â And thus again my pensive musings flow To snatches of another melody, That in the heat of feeling now come out On the dim plain of memory, as stamps Worn and obliterated long from coin, By fire are to the surface brought again. 1. Ah! well-a-way! The cloud will come; but after comes the sun. Youth lies within the heart, and youth and sorrow Were never strangers since the Eden-fall. Sorrow descends upon the flower of youth, As snow upon the crimson April-bloom, Not with a blighting chill, but with a soft And kindly pressure, that to youth gives strength, Warmth to the crimson blossom, and to both The panoply that shields From after-coming storms. 2. Ah! well-a-way! Sin was begot in Hell, and sorrow born In Eden, but the two are ever twinn'd. Without the sin the sorrow might not come: But with the sin, the sorrow is a bright, Redeeming angel, pointing to a time When sin was not; to an eternity When sin shall be no more; and to a God Who in his mercy gave the sorrow birth, That thus the sin might die, And man again be pure. So sang I but a little month ago, Walking within ambrosial groves, that look'd Out on green pastures, over gleaming waves. And now, so quickly in this genial clime The fair and fruitful seasons follow on, The bright and full-robed summer-time is here. âHow beautifully glimmer on my sight The fresh green fields afar! How grandly rise The groves that gloom around me! What a hush Broods o'er this dell! And how yon hillside basks In the full blaze of this unspotted day! All these have been my haunts from childhood up; And only recent years have made my feet Once unfamiliar with their flowery paths. But absence has not robbed them of a charm, Nor distance of their sweet attractiveness; And my heart turns to them as to old friends. Morn after morn my footsteps hither tend; Noon after noon the slumberous silence fills My yearning heart, which still has aching voids; Eve after eve I linger here alone, Piercing the shadow of the day that is, To find the sunlight of the days that were. âThe April flush has parted from the woods; The redolent airs of May have gone to rest With locust-tassels and the wild-grape's bloom; The blue-eyed violet no more is seen Peeping from mossy coverts at the sky That looks down through the tree-tops; from the slopes The tremulous anemone is gone; The dandelions, that on the grassy plains Were beautiful,âflecks from the golden curls Of bright Aurora thrown,âhave pass'd away. These were the firstlings of the opening Year; And like the firstlings of the human heart, The beautiful young hopes that spring to light And perish as the sterner days come on, They are no more. A statelier growth is now Giving green glory to the forest-aisles, And beauty to the meadows. Far away The alder-thicket, robed in brightest bloom, Is shining like a sunlit cloud at rest; Nearer, the briar-roses load the air With sweetness; and where yon half-hidden fence And toppling cabin mark the Pioneer's First habitation in the wilderness, The gay bignonia to the ridge-pole climbs, The yellow willow spreads its generous shade Around the cool spring's margin, and the old And bent catalpa waves its fan-like leaves And lifts its milk-white blossoms. Beautiful! Around me here rise up majestic trees That centuries have nurtured: graceful elms, Which interlock their limbs among the clouds; Dark-columned walnuts, from whose liberal store The nut-brown Indian maids their baskets fill'd Ere the first Pilgrims knelt on Plymouth Rock; Gigantic sycamores, whose mighty arms Sheltered the Redman in his wigwam prone, What time the Norsemen roamed our chartless seas; And towering oaks, that from the subject plain Sprang when the builders of the tumuli First disappeared, and to the conquering hordes Left these, the dim traditions of their race That rise around, in many a form of earth Tracing the plain, but shrouded in the gloom Of dark, impenetrable shades, that fall From the far centuries. Eternal night, Rayless and ruthless, where this luminous day Displays its varied and resplendent charms! I turn from that to these, as from a book Whose lids are sealed, to one whose open leaves Are full of wisdom and of beauty. See! How through the high-arch'd windows of the trees That line this bank, the fresh green landscape glows! And how from the broad mirror of yon stream The glinting rays of the bright sun are turn'd! Like fiery arrows quivering through the gloom Of forest-aisles, they glance upon me now, But break in golden fragments round my feet. The quiet of a tranquil mind is where Yon homestead stands amid embowering vines, And clustering fruits; and where yon merry groups Of children sit beneath the maple shade, Wreathing sweet garlands for each other's bright And sunny brows, is innocence; and where Yon plowman meditates amidst his corn, Dark and luxuriant, Plenty sits and smiles! And Peace is heard, in many a gentle sound Of tinkling bell and lowing cattle, where Yon herd knee-deep in lushest grasses feeds, And where yon mower from his heavy swath Rises, and rests, and whets his ringing scythe. On the green, skirting slope that lies beyond, Where fitful shadows with the sunshine play, And where white flocks in statue-like repose Are gathered under solitary elms, There sleeps the beauty of a dream of Heaven. And over all the scene the calm blue sky Bends in its summer glory, stooping down Amid soft clouds that kiss the sunny checks Of airy hills, and there hang motionless. How beautiful! how joyous! how serene! Yet oh! how desolate, bereft of her Into whose young and all-impressive heart The silence and the beauty of the scene So deeply sank when first she hither came. Her years then numbered ten; and six since then Have woven their summer garlands for her brow; And one has brought the cypress and the yew, And laid upon her heartâher glad young heart! The day was one, like this, of untold charms. Earth, heaven, the waters, and the wandering winds, Each lent its tribute to make up a whole Whose memories are written, even now, In lines of light which darkness can not dim. We wandered up and down; now in these groves, Now on the rims of meadow-plats, anon Far in the silent wood. A summer's day She gathered flowers, and mock'd the birds, and blew The time o' the day on grey-beard dandelions. When eve approached, we hither came, and paused, Struck with the various beauty of the scene. She sat beside me on this grassy knoll, That looks out on it all, and gazed and gazed Until that mind, so darken'd now, was fill'd With light from heaven, and love for earth, and joy That in such pleasant places God had cast Our lot. We lingered till the sun went down; Then, silent as the shadows of the night That gathered round us, took our homeward way. Sweet scene! sweet memories! how ye brighten up, And throng the ways that to the burdened heart Lead in, with incidents of many years Crowding a single moment! ... Time wore on: Her schoolâmy avocationsâcity life, That puts so many fetters on the limbs, Conspired to limit, and at times prevent. Our visits to the farther solitudes, And green savannas, and cool, vocal groves, That in the bosom of Miami Woods Still offer to the over-wearied heart The silence and the solace that it craves. But nothing made us strangers here:âwe came When came the bluebird and the violetâ And when the summers put their glory on, We stood within its radianceâand our hearts Grew pensive in the golden quietude That came when Autumn brought her misty airs, And sang the season's requiem. Not a year, Of five that flow'd in light and beauty on, Pass'd over without bringing us to bathe Our spirits in the quiet pools of Thought That lay unruffled here. Her early love Of Nature, fostered by these interviews, Grew stronger day by day, and through the bonds Of common sympathy, she soon became A part of all this scene, and it of her. I see her now, through shadows and through tears, In all her beauty wandering by my side, And hear her voice, with snatches of old song, Swell up, and die away, and wake again. âVain apparition! memories vainer still! Ye make me feel how much alone I am, More than I felt before: ye bend the bow, And barb the arrows that transfix my heart. Oh, from this scene the bloom hath faded now; And that which was the soul of it to me, The glory and the grace, sits far away, Beneath the shadow of a sorrow big With all that can affright, or overwhelm. ... My heart would breakâmy stricken heart would break, Could I not pour upon the murmuring winds, When thus it swells, the burden of its woe, In words that soothe, how sad soe'er they be. 1. Sweet bird that, deep in beechen shades embower'd, Sittest and pour'st the sorrow of thy heart, Till all the woods around Throb as in heavy griefâ Mourn now with me: in deepest shades of sorrow Sits my lone heart, and pours its plaint of woe, Till in sad unison Throbs every heart around. 2. Sweet brook, that over shining pebbles glidest In quiet, with a low and plaintive moan, Made to the listening woods And to the leaning flowersâ Mourn now with me: like thine my life in quiet Glides on and on, with songs of flowers and woods; Nor asks a gayer scene, Or other auditors. 3. Sweet summer wind, that, high among the branches Of elm, and poplar, and of towering oak, Sighest the morning out, Sighest the evening inâ Mourn now with me: in and from early boyhood, I've loved with you these lone and sinless haunts, Nor asked to pour my song Where the proud world might hear. 4. Sweet bird, sweet brook, sweet summer wind, oh listen! Come to me from the throbbing beechen shade, From moaning hollows come, And from the sighing treesâ Mourn now with me: mourn for the dear one absent, Who loved you with a love as strong as mine: Mourn for the mind's eclipseâ Unutterable woe! Beyond the cloud that darkens the sweet morn The sun shines ever. When the rain has pass'd, The grass is robed in diamonds, and the pools Dimple with every breeze. Behind the tears That gather in the gentle maiden's eyes When feelingly she sings her saddest song, The laugh lurks ever, showing bright through all, And bringing to her bosom quick relief. Sorrow is strong; and from its roots, that clasp Rebellious passions in the Eden-life, It sends out folds that wind about the heart, And tendrils that cling to it evermore: But these oft beautify, and even at times Support; and were this never so, beyond The roots of sorrow lies the birth of hopeâ And hope is mightier than sorrow, far. Part Fourth. 1852. Miami Woods! From busy scenes of life, Of vaunting littleness and fretting state, Of vain ambitions and repulsive pride, Of sin, and sorrow, and nefarious wrong, I come again for meditation, peace, And healthful exercise, to these far haunts, Where human passions have not yet destroy'd The calm repose, the majesty, the might, Of Nature. Summer here has garlanded The pillars of these glorious temples round, And laid the light mosaic floor, and built The groinÃ¨d arches, and spread out above The fretted roof. And here I gladly steal From the hot glare of day, and from the strife Of ever-clashing interests, that make Society the thing it should not be, Not only to commune with my own soul In solitude, but 'mid these calm retreats To contemplate the busy world without, Its higher aims, its littleness, its pride, And the gigantic meannesses that make Sin of repute by contrast! ... Come with me, Ye whose hearts sicken at the tales of woe, Oppression, avarice, hatred, lust and war, Which faster than the winds now fly about: Stand with me here upon the forest's edge, And look out on the quiet, happy homes, That dot the landscape, each with plenty bless'd, And crown'd with sweet content, so rarely found: See the broad, sunny fields of ripening grain, How peacefully they lie! the orchards see, Loaded with shining fruits! the garden spots, Bright with their vegetation! and the wide, Smooth meadow-lands, with lowing herds alive, And bleating flocks! Look out upon it allâ Its peace, its plenty, its sequestered joysâ And say if this shall e'er become the scene Of blood and carnage: if disastrous war, With rampant horrors and unsparing lust, Shall ever desolate these happy homes! âThe plains of Greece, Italia's sunny vales, All Europe's broad expanse, fit answer give, If human passions rule without restraint, And bold ambition be not held in check. What is the lesson of the past? O'er earth,â So runs the bloody chronicle,âthe sword Has claim'd dominion ever. By the plow Patient and toiling industry has striven, And turn'd the soil, and planted; but the sword Has cut the harvest, and its myrmidons Have filled their garners first. To charge and hold The distaff, and to ply the busy wheel, Has been the woman's office; but the spear Has caught the thread upon its gory point, And had it woven into trappings gay For conquering legions. Where the falchion flash'd The cross has crumbled: where the battle-shout Has risen, there the prayer has died away: And in the populous valleys, where the tramp Of armÃ¨d hosts has sounded like the sea, 'Mid rapine, and debauch, and smoke, and flame, The happy homes of innocence and peace Have disappeared. Ambition, leagued with lust, Laid his red hand upon the ancient world, And it stood still with terror.âEarth again, In these the later years, has been the scene Of deadliest conflicts, till terrific throes Have rent the bosom of society. Thrones then have rock'd, and rulers stood aghast, As if this solid and substantial orb Were quaking under them, and gaping seams Hissed for their quick engulfment. Wild, and fierce, And desolating periods have pass'd, Till Horror's maw was glutted, and he sank Sated with blood. Peace then has come again, With her benignant voice, and countenance Haloed like a divinity's; and men, Led captive by her many beautiful ways, And by the majesty that girt her round, And by the providence that she displayed, And by the prosperous arts that sprung to life Where'er she pass'd, have risen and followed her. But still the sword asserts dominion; still War eateth out the substance of the lands: And when, oh! when shall human tongue proclaim, Peace is the throned divinity of Earth! Order and Freedom are her ministers! Order and Freedom! this God's highest gift, That his primordial lawâdistinct, yet oneâ For without union neither can endure, This running wild, that darting from the grooves Of due adjustment. How the equipoise Fails in the roll of nations from the first! That is not Freedom, which of old in Greece Oiled the glib tongues of cunning orators, Till with proclaimed respect for human rights The walls of senates echoed that which was, If not the hollowest mockery and scorn, A blistering satire on the very name Of Liberty. That is not Freedom which Has fed so oft Parisian guillotines With blood that cried to God and man for quick And terrible revenge. Nor freedom that, No matter who or what may call it so, Which is, in any form, but foul misuse Of liberty to think, and speak, and act: 'T is but licentiousness, and soon or late, By boisterous and brutish courses, thwarts The end it aims at. Nor is Order that Which reigned in Warsaw, when the red-winged scourge From Russia madly swept o'er Poland's plains. Nor Order that which gave to modern Rome A seeming quiet, when the serried ranks Pass'd from the bubbling chaos that is France, And stifled the awakening soul of Right And Freedom on the fields of old renown. Order is never that, whate'er its name, Which moves engirt by intellectual thralls, Or bristling iron flashing stern command: This is but chain'd disorder, that, with eyes Which never sleep, and sinews ne'er unbraced, Watches and waits its moment, when, self-loosed, It breaks all bounds, and mocks all consequenceâ Prostrating by its fierce, convulsive throes, Order and freedom both: then Chaos reigns. Dread pictureâdark and dread! My Country, thou Who sitt'st among the nations like a queen On whom all eyes are fixed, upon thy brow The Khoinoor of regal gems in wornâ The Mount of Light, within whose steady ray The wandering feet of millions hither tend: Oh, may the blight of faction, and the curse Of dark cabal, be spared thy generous breast! Thou art the hope of Freedom, and the dread Of Tyranny. Within thy bosom lies A nursling giant, slumbering now, who thence Shall draw the strength which fabling bards of old Bestowed on world-sustaining Atlas. Grant, Oh, Thou who mak'st the courses of the stars, And art no less the guide and guard of man, That when this germ of mightiest power shall reach Its certain and its due development, It shall not smite, with matricidal hand, The bosom that hath nourished it; but give Its majesty of strength, its cumulate Of wisdom, its capacity for good, To Man, to Truth, to Freedom, and to God! Time writes upon the earth, in many ways, Wise admonition, that man's eagle eye, Bent on the stars in cold ambition's heaven, Stoops not to read. The far-away, the dim, The difficult, who sees not? 'T is the plain, Whose lessons lie along our daily paths, That none behold, or comprehend. And yet, The palpable is eloquent. There lies A column, where a Grecian temple stood: There stands a crumbling wall where Roman might Built up its proudest structure:âBoth relate The self-same story of aggressive power, Of wild ambition for extended rule, And of intestine strifes that live on blood, And die in desolation. Far away From these dark relics and their lessonâfar, Where the adventurous Genoese descried Another world, and gave it to the free, There hangs a picture of gigantic size And wonderful design. Although, as yet, In any part unfinished, and in some Almost untouched, it still displays in all A towering genius, and a master hand. It shows a nearly limitless expanse Of hill and vale, of mountain and of plain. Wide-spreading forests strike the wildered eye, At first, of gorgeous foliage, varied hue, And most majestic height. Savannas green Between the mountain ranges stretch away, Till in the endless wood they lose themselves, Or mingle with the sky, and of its blue Become an undistinguishable part. Down the deep gorges of the mountain sides Careering torrents tumble. Runnels leap In cataracts white as wool from rock to rock, And plunge in dark abysses. O'er the plains Gigantic rivers hold their solemn way, Now disappearing in the wilderness, Now flashing back the light of sun and stars. Far in the background of this wondrous scene, Where matchless Power has stooped and hollowed out Stupendous basins in the eternal rock, Vast lakes repose in majesty, that have No parallels on earth. Minuter view, Scanning the picture close in all its parts, Discloses habitations on the slopes Of gentle hills, and sunny intervales Covered with grain, and orchards bending low With rich and ripening fruits, and grassy fields Where the cow fills her udder, and the lamb Crops undisturbed. And other scrutiny Reveals the prosperous city here and there, Wherein are practiced the fair arts of peace, And virtue brings its crowning joy, content. The prostrate column, and the crumbling wall, That tell of desolation, are not here. No footprints of the Past reveal themselves O'er all this wide domain, save in the wrecks Of an extinguished race that lie aroundâ The tomb, the altar and the citadel, Which Time in his long lapse has robed in green Softer than velvet, making beautiful Not only what were desolation else, But the wide prospect round. The pillar'd pride Of lofty groves, the dark luxuriant growth Of virgin plains, and the resistless sweep Of rivers on whose marge the bison-herd And antlered elk feed quietly, proclaim, That for the footsteps of the Future, here Lie the appointed ways. Above the lone And prostrate column, Memory may weep, And by the crumbling wall: but joyous Hope Comes with high courage and elastic limb, And to each mountain of this marvelous scene, And to each valley, points and leads the way. Ah! Hope is strong to nationsâstrong to me: But the bright ray that broke upon my path When last I wandered in these silent shades, Soon blackened like the night around my heart: For darkness dreader than its first eclipse O'erwhelmed again that young and struggling mind, Which here had opened first to gleams of Truth, And brightened to the Beautiful around. Miami Woods! from these sequestered haunts For many a long and weary month, till now, Again I've been an exile, sick at heart, And brooding o'er the sorrow of my lifeâ A sorrow that has been baptized in tears So often, it is holier grown than love, Or hope, or memories that perish not. Again I stand by the remembered shrines At which she earliest worship'd God with me. How strongly seems her youthful impress fixed On every thing around! E'en now my soul Is busy with a faint and simple chime, To which the waving leaf and murmuring breeze Bear sweet accompaniment, in full accord. 1. Cool summer woods! I walk not now alone: The form of her whose darkness makes my woe, Childlike as when she last was with me here, Gleams brightly on me from the undergrowth, And glides anear me in the deepening shade, As if she were not far, ah! far away. 2. Dim forest walks! That young and radiant face Looks out from every silent bush around,â And that glad voice, which rang so often here, Breaks ever and anon from flowery nooks And sunny knolls that were her chief delight, As if she were not far, ah! far away. 3. Sweet, calm retreats! From old familiar paths, From favorite seats beside the babbling spring, From leafy coverts close along my way, I see her start in many a graceful bound, With wildwood garlands bright upon her brows, As if she were not far, ah! far away. Sad, soothing chimeâit lingers on the air In sweet reverberations, like the sounds Of far-off bells, that in the hush of night Cease not, but pass into our dreams; and now, The waving leaf and murmuring breeze prolong Its closing cadence, till the creeping brook, The tinkling water-fall, the drowsy eve, Repeat the burden, echoing to my heart In plaintive measures, âFar, ah! far away!â Part Fifth. 1852. Calm, still retreats, I visit you again: Now with a face of gladness, and a heart None the less swelling with its gratitude Because despair was never quite despair. God has been merciful! Where darkness dwelt The light has come again, and with its rays The phantoms of the mind have vanished. Hush Even the whispering zephyrs, while I kneel And breathe my invocation! ... Come to me, Ye birds that go not when the summer goes: Pause in your winding way, ye murmuring streams: Gather about me, ye soft autumn airs That linger in the woodlands yet, and play Above the sunny meadows: still look up, Pale, perishing blossoms, from your dusky couch Of fallen leaves: lean forward now, ye rocks, And trees, and hills, that your dull ears may catch The faintest accent of my trembling voice, While fervently I thank the God of all For this last mercy to me! ... Father! Thou Hast taken from my heart its weight of woe; Hast rent the veil that shut the light of hope Long from my spirit; hast lifted up the black And terrible pall that lay upon my soulâ Transforming it to white and shining robes, For the fair form long hidden from my view, And given the dear one back into my arms Thus panoplied in Light. Thanks, thanks, oh God! AdorableâSupremeâEternal One! Ah! not an answering tone from all the groves! My joyous heart, that craves the sympathy Of whatsoe'er is nearest, beats alone. The flowers that were the glory of the spring, The singing birds that made the summer glad, And the green leaves that through the changing months Danced in the sun and whispered to the breeze, All, all have pass'd away. The weary gales Come sighing from the meadows up the slope, And die in plaintive murmurs: in the elm The jay screams hoarsely, and the squirrel barks Where the old oak stands naked: from the leaves, That rustle to my tread, an odor comes As of mortality. It is the sad, Sweet period of the year our calends call The âIndian Summer.â Beautifully pass The seasons into this. The harvest done, The summer days round slowly with a hush Into the quiet of the August noons. Fields then lie bare; the skies grow milky-blue; The streams run lazily; the tiniest child Can jump the brooks, or wade them dry at knee; One far retired in this wide Wood, can hear Its deep heart throb, so still is every thing: Out o'er the meadows, where from earliest morn The grazing herds have fed, they quit the dry, Hot grasses, and seek out the shadiest pools, Where, plunging belly-deep, they thus await The cooler eve's approach so quietly, They look like statues from red granite hewn, Or cast in bronze, or cut in ivory; The restless sheep are scattered, each with nose Thrust in protecting grasses; by the bars, Beneath the walnut shade, the horses dose The mid-day hours away; around the fields, The groves are silent; dotting here and there The faded landscape, like gray clouds at rest, The old farm-houses lie; the lolling dog, That ever claims the shadow of the porch, Frets the hot noon through; all is still beside. The quivering flame of August noons, at length, Burns out; and with September's equinox The earth grows cooler, and the quicken'd airs More freshly touch the cheek: but summer's breath Yet lingers, till the still October comes With frosty nights, and slumberous, sunny days: Then falls the leaf; then fades along the fence The golden-rod; then turns the aster pale; Then fly the song-birds, by the robin led, Whose voices through the summer months have fill'd The woods with music, far to southern haunts, In orange thickets by Suwanee's shore, And Mississippi's broad magnolia groves. Another haze now overspreads the sky, That thickens into dark November clouds; And soon, from where the stormy Saginaw Lets loose the northern blasts, come driving down Fierce wintry winds o'er wide and frozen plains, Till drizzly days bring snowy nights, and all Is desolate.âBut vainly yet the light And feathery flakes descend on earth, and cling Upon the trees; for often still come warm And sunny noons, which lift the thin white shroud From limbs it prematurely wraps, and lay The folded linen back from Nature's face. âAgain the sunshine lightens up the vales, And sleeps upon the hillsides: heav'n looks loveâ And earth looks gratitudeâand all the air Sinks to a holy calm, like that which comes Upon cathedral aisles when the last chant Of voices, and the organ's closing peals, Die lingeringly away. Another change Now follows silently; and from the broad And grassy plains, and from the fallen leaves That strew the forest-walks, and from the hills And from the streams, like incense rises up A gentle, all-pervading, softening haze, As quiet and as soothing as the prayer Last breathed in life from holiest Christian lips. A sweet, voluptuous languor, fills the air: The sun is shorn of his bright beams, and looks Redly and dimly down upon the earth: The moon glows like a buckler, as she mounts In quiet from the misty depths, which now No marked horizon separates from the dome That spreads above: the starry hosts are lost, All but the larger lights, which dimly walk The heavens alone. The breezes of the night Catch the last lingering sweets of autumn-time, And with them bring the murmurs of the brooks To lull the senses to repose. The warm And wanton airs that through the slumberous day Steal gently up from southern climes, caress The willing cheek, and fold the languid frame In long embraces, and on couches spread In sunny spots of silence, thickly strewn With sweetest smelling leaves, lie down with it In panting ecstasies of soft delights. Now all the woodlands round, and these fair vales, And the broad plains that from their borders stretch Away to the blue Unica, and run Along the Ozark range, and far beyond Find the still groves that shut Itasca in, But, more than all, these old Miami Woods, Are robed in golden exhalations, dim As half-remembered dreams, and beautiful As aught of Valambrosa, or the plains Of Arcady, by fabling poets sung. The night is fill'd with murmurs, and the day Distils a subtle atmosphere, that lulls The senses to a half repose, and hangs A rosy twilight over nature, like The night of Norway summers, when the sun Skims the horizon through the tedious months. Now airs as warm and sweet as those that kiss The blossoms of the groves in Florida, Steal softly whispering through the woods, and crimp The sleeping streams. New leases of new life Seem given to him whose evanescent years Are rounding to a long repose. His couch Is near the window wheeled, his weary head Is bolstered up, that he may thus look out Upon the hazy landscape, and inhale The grateful air. Anon he feels his heart Thrill with a subtle influence, that lifts His thoughts above the world; and then his brain Throbs with delight a moment, when he sinks Silently back in beatific dreams, That give his soul a foretaste of the bliss It soon shall know in heaven. While over him Whose life is in the vigor still of youth, Comes a sweet languor, touching first his limbs, Then creeping stealthily along each vein, And spreading till he yields himself at will To the delicious sense of life alone. Such is the âIndian Summer,âânamed by those Who hither came while yet the Redman held Dominion here. No fabling pen portrays This season's sweet, luxurious, transient sway. Not man alone, though he in chief, enjoys Its brief career: the summer-working bee, Voluptuous in his tastes, is tempted forth, And forages with skill; across my path The hoarding squirrel springs with fresh-got spoil; The winter birds discard the sumach seed, And dry wild-grapes, and haunt the sunny nooks That lure the worm and insect out, for food Of daintier sort. All nature seems to feel, Throughout her frame, the genial influence; And woods and streams, and hills and valleys, look Praises to God, the Infinite, the Good. Miami Woods! day after day, for near A fortnight now, I've come at early morn And loitered till the eve, from point to point Threading the forest mazes many a mile; Now sitting, like the soul of Solitude, On a brown hill-side backed by naked elms, Gazing into the waters of the stream That kissed its base, of many shadows full, As if they were futurity; anon, Hanging above the vestiges of life In the world's infancy, that strew the plains, And dot the slopes, and crown the highest hills; Then lingering amid the stately groves That girdle in the broad white fields of corn, Whose golden ears yet hang within the husk; Then passing with the farmer's children up From underneath the beech and hack-berry trees, Partaking freely soon of wholesome fare, And cheating the long evening in discourse Of Boone and Kenton and the Pioneers, Of Pontiac and Ellenipsico, Of Logan, the heart-broken chief, of bold Tecumseh and the Prophet, Raisin's red And terrible massacre, and Erie's great And glorious victoryâthen all to bed: Next morn, with only thanks given and received For all this hospitality, away Into the rustling forest-paths again, Deep-lost in admiration at the brave Resistance which the Redmen here had made To the encroaching tides that drove them back Farther and farther in the wilderness, And kindred admiration of the bold, Resistless progress of the Pioneers, Whose spirit hardest toil could not subdue, Whom dangers daunted not, nor death appall'd. The âIndian Summerâ thus hath pass'd awayâ The soft, luxurious days of indolence, Voluptuous and wildering as a dream Of Hafiz in the Persian citron groves, Fann'd by the spicy zephyrs of the East, And sung to slumber by the Bulbul rocked In sweetest folds of the imperial rose. âNow, from the stormy Huron's broad expanse, From Mackinaw and from the Michigan, Whose billows beat upon the sounding shores And lash the surging pines, come sweeping down Ice-making blasts, and raging sheets of snow: The heavens grow darker daily; bleakest winds Shriek through the naked woods; the robber owl Hoots from his rocking citadel all night; And all the day unhousÃ¨d cattle stand Shivering and pinch'd. By many a potent sign The dark and dreary days of Winter thus Inaugurate their king. A summer bird, I fly before his breath.âLoved haunts, farewell! Part Sixth. 1853. A year agoâa little year agoâ How long I lingered in these quiet haunts! The earth was ne'er more beautiful than then, Day darkened into night so peacefully, And night so freshly brightened into day: But storm and darkness pass'd upon the scene, And swept it like a scourge. A year ago, A little year ago, the stricken one From scattering shadows look'd out on that earth, And brightened in its beauty. Her young heart And mine took lesson of the night and day, And pass'd like them each into either's depths: But storm and darkness visit not the earth Alone, to desolate and to destroy; They fall upon the human heart as well, And sweep it also like a deadly scourge. 1. I had a little sprite whose name was Hopeâ It sang glad songs into my eager ear; But when most loved its notes died all away, And now its songs are still'd forevermoreâ Forevermore. 2. I heard a voice, born of my human love, Speak to my human weakness words of joy; Each was as sweet as sounds of dulcimers, But all are silent now forevermoreâ Forevermore. 3. I held within my own a little hand, White as the moon, and it became as cold; I pressed it to my lips in agony; 'T was then withdrawnâwithdrawn forevermoreâ Forevermore. 4. I've worn a faded lily on my breast These many days, these many weary days; But now, by unseen fingers touch'd, it falls, It falls away, and falls forevermoreâ Forevermore. 5. I held a beautiful and precious gem Against my beating heart, for many a year; But while most cherished it hath turn'd to dust, And here I lay it down forevermoreâ Forevermore. Oh, many are the sweet and gentle flowers, Caught by untimely frosts, that droop and die Ere half their beauty has disclosed itself: The dews of evening and the stars of night Watch o'er and weep for them, and kindly airs Bear them to earth, and lay them in repose. And many are the pure and gentle hearts, Untimely touched by Death, that render up The hopes and promises of opening life Without a murmur, and go calmly down, Along the way of shadows, to the grave. And such an one has just been laid to rest, Here, where the hectic leaf of autumn falls And strews the fresh-heap'd earth, and where the pale And perishing blossoms of the year lie low. 1. Birds of the greenwood groves, and sunny meads! Whose voices ever fill'd her with delight, Come from the mirror of the glassy pool, Come from the thicket's edge where berries hang, Come from each airy perch and favorite haunt, And from your sweet and ever-plaintive throats Pour forth, in soft and melancholy staves, A dirge above the loved and early lost! 2. Winds of the spring-time! ye that bear the sounds Of far-off murmurs on your dewy wings, And steal a cadence from the running brook, That rob the insect of its hum, and catch The harp's last note, still trembling on the strings, Pause here a little while, above this grave, And in the tenderest tones of all, breathe out A requiem for the loved and early lost. 3. Light breezes of the summer! wandering far, Combine in one the many sounds of grief Ye gather in your long and lonely way, And wed with them all sounds of earth and air Too sorrowful for other company, And murmur them at morn and eventide, And in the hush of noon, above the spot Where sleeps in death the loved and early lost! 4. Soft, sighing gales of autumn! from the brown And melancholy meadows, from the gloom Of rocky caverns, from the plaining woods, That mourn the hectic leaf and fading flower, From deepest hollows and from highest hills, Bring all the soft, sweet voices that are born, And pour the saddest plaint that ever yet Was uttered for the loved and early lost! Part Seventh. 1856. Miami Woods! once more, in pilgrim guise, I seek your venerable shades. My heart Is swelling with a thousand memories Of her who, in her youthful beauty, roamed The child of Nature here. The lapsing years Came with their seasons redolent of bloom, Abounding fruitfulness, and garnered wealth: Chances and changes left their impress here, On many a scene: the glory of the woods Faded and fell where migratory man Spied out the land, and chose his new abode: The quiet of the sylvan Solitude Was broken by unusual sounds, that woke New echoes in its depths, as through them rush'd, With arrowy speed, careering Power, that dragg'd The freighted car, along whose mighty track The monarchs of the forest disappeared: Where the rude cabin of the pioneer Lay like a shadow on the grassy plain, Or on the wooded slope, when first her feet Wandered in prattling infancy along Meandering rivulet and bounding brook, The trellised cottage with its crown of flowers Appeared, and statelier mansions rose anon: The hand of civilization touch'd each scene, And changed it: even our last retreats were not Exempt, but into far secluded haunts, Whose natural beauty art could only mar, The axe, the compass, and the chain were borne, Dividing and despoiling: onward came The multitudes who people now these plains And hills, not as a calm-careering stream, But like a rushing torrent:âStill, the love Of Nature, in her quiet, far retreats, Oft brought us to these old majestic groves, That even avarice hath not yet laid low. In this our long companionship with woods, And waters, and the star-like flowers that line Each rustling path, and the bright, wingÃ¨d tribes, That give the incorporeal air a voice, And all but an embodiment, she became, To me, a part of every sight and sound Throughout this wide domain. And on each breeze That steals up softly from yon babbling brook, Her joyous tones come floating to me now; And turn where'er I will I see her form, For every mossy nook and flowery slope Is living with her image. Here, where time Has spared a leafy covert of old days, We sat when last she visited these scenes. The shadow of a mighty sorrow still Rested upon her soul; but day by day Returning light was lifting up the veil; And in among these old familiar haunts I saw the struggle memory made with doubt, And viewed the gradual triumph. Soon we left, For other scenes that lay in sweet repose, And golden beauty, where the winter's reign Is mild, and shortened by a kindlier clime. Once more in beauty came the blessÃ©d spring, And garlanded the earth. We were away, Mid buds and blossoms of the sweet South-West, Seeking to strengthen still the nestling hope That God again had sent us. From her brow Faded the darkness of its late eclipse; And with the gentle, spicy airs, that oft Stole up from the far Gulf of Mexico, Bearing the sweets of rifled orange groves And jasmine thickets, she drank in what seemed To be a new and rarer life, and grew Stronger and stronger, till her heart again Yearned for the gloom of woods, the glance of waves, The arrowy gleam of wings among the trees, And the glad songs of birds. And hence we went Out where the groves had a familiar look, When she roused up as from a dream, and shook With passionate joy. She held but slight discourse Herself, as yet, but gave a willing ear, And more than pleased assent, to converse framed Of Nature, and the visible Universe, Of Faith, and Hope, and Love,âand at the name Of God, or Christ, would humbly bow her head. To singing birds and blooming flowers she gave Quick recognition, and her lips would part, And her cheeks flush, when memories awoke That long had slumbered. She would fondly pause Where rippling waters made a soothing sound, And where in crystal pools the bright blue heaven Was mirrored, and the fleck of passing clouds. But hope is vainâand human strength is vainâ And tears and agony and love and life, All, all are vain. As transient as the spring Were the fair promises that bade our hearts Rejoice. The jewel still retain'd its light, But the enshrining casket had been rent, And might not be made whole again. She knew, Ere yet suspicion had aroused our fears, That Death with ruthless hand was cutting loose The cords of life. Yet still through meadowy fields, That stretched in quiet beauty to the shade Of neighboring groves, whose calm retreats she loved, We bore her often. But her feeble frame Grew feebler as the passing spring went by With its cool airs; and when the summer came, She faded like a flower before its breath; And ere the first of autumn moons grew round, She told us, as the sad and weary winds Came sighing up the slope, that she should die. We bade her hope: she looked up at the heavens, To tell us that her only hope was there. We told her God was merciful, and good, And just, and that he would not call her hence, So young, so beautiful, so loved of all. A momentary shade across her face Pass'd like an agony, and disappeared. Then with a light upon her countenance That awed us into silence, it became So like a halo, she with steady hand Drew in clear lines the far-off grassy slope Where she would lie, beside the younger three Who pass'd to death before herâtraced a slab, Whereon she wrote her name, and these few words, âShe sleeps in peace,ââthen with prophetic ken Inscribed the year below. Ere many days, Though sorrow came and dimm'd again her brow, Without a tear she press'd our swelling hearts To hers, and on the ashen lips of each Printed her farewell kissâthen gave her thoughts To God, who had her heart and all her hopes, Breathing her life away without a moan, Or audible sigh, and sank to sleep in death. We bore her body to the grave she wish'd, And laid it with her kindred. Earth contains, In her enfolding bosom, few more bright, More beautiful, more loved: and fewer still, Who, taken in the blossom of their years, So willingly, so trustingly, went down To the dark chambers of the silent tomb. Sorrow is of the Earth, and joy of Heaven. The dust of what she was, is hereâthe soul, That clothed it with a glory from above, Roams now untrammel'd through eternal space, Singing with angels round the Throne of God, And in the fountains of perpetual peace Bathing its shining plumes. Such is our faithâ And yet we mourn for her, and can but mourn, She walked the shadowy shores of death so long, And struggled through their gloom so patiently, Only to close her little dream of life, And lay the casket of her soul aside, When the thick mists were rising, and the world Spread out beneath them, bright and beautiful. L'EnVoy. Miami Woods!âThe glory of a Dream Rests on and beautifies the Real now. What unto me your friendly shades have been, That will they be foreverâeven more. A sorrow common makes a common bond Where else there would be none. Ye have beheld My human anguish, and my human joy: Ye are the friend to whom, in after years, My heart will oftenest turn, amid its toil, And sorrow, and dismay: your bosom holds What unto it was more than words can tell: But hence my voice is silent in these grovesâ I sing no more the beauty and the strength Here traced in many a green and flowery line, And standing in the arching majesty Of temples whose gigantic pillars rest In the foundations of far centuries: I sing no more the passion and the pain That here o'ercame me: the triumphant joy With which, when last I bade these scenes farewell, I went upon my way, all starr'd with light, I sing no more forever. The sweet hope, That like an angel sat beside my heart And sang away its sorrow then, hath since Gone down in desolation. That which was The central harmony of all this song, The beautiful young Life that to each swell And cadence gave the spirit that it hath, It is no more a bodily presence here, It is no more of earth; and now the last Faint strain of this prolonged and fitful lay, Which but for her, and for the love she bore These scenes, had known no second touch, must die Into a murmurous soundâa sighâa breath. II. A Golden Wedding. THE ROLLING FORK. I. On the Rolling Fork in Hardin, Where the winds and waters chime, And sing to the listening traveler Songs full of the olden time, Stood a dwelling thrown wide open To the wanton airs of May, That stole up over sloping meadows Which stretched from its doors awayâ Here dotted with groves, there reaching To sunny and shady nooks, Where the elder-bloom sway'd gently To the ripple of purling brooks, And where the voices of children From blossoming thickets rang, As, with jest, and shout, and banter, From rock to rock they sprang. II. 'T was the home of an aged couple, Who many and many a year Had sown and reap'd and garner'd The fruits of life's labors here. And now there had gladly gather'd, From near and from far away, A merry troop of their kindred, And friends of an early day: For this was their âGolden Wedding;â And the heavens stoop'd down and smiled As sweetly and tenderly o'er them, As a mother o'er her child. Songs of birds, and the breath of flowers, Floated in on the sunny air; And God's benison seem'd resting All round them, everywhere. III. As friend met friend with greetings, How rapidly backward flew The curtains of time, displaying The scenes of the past anew! And soon they were where Lake Erie Heaved its billows like the sea, And then by the moaning waters Of the battle-stain'd Maumee; And anon where the bright Scioto Day's arrowy beams flash'd back, As it water'd the Indian gardens That border'd its shining track: Then they saw the blood of their kindred Tinge the Wabash and the Thames, And anon heard the streams of Kentucky Murmuring their honor'd names. IV. And as the lengthening shadows Of the years still upward roll'd, And they talk'd of the days of their danger, And the tales of their triumphs told, Tears gather'd in silent sorrow For some who had found their rest Ere blazed in its fullness the glory That dawn'd on the Early West. But they all felt proud of the heroes Who had sprung at their country's call, For its flag, which they carried, to battle, For their homes, if 't were needed, to fall. And the tears which had started in sorrow, And silence, were check'd by their pride, And they still talk'd old times with the bridegroom, And recall'd still old sports to the bride. V. And while far behind on life's highways Their thoughts were thus tenderly cast, One rose in their midst and recited This page from the Book of the Pastâ One who, in the strength of his manhood, Had moved oft in the scenes now brought back, And remember'd the Woman's devotion All along the Man's perilous track:â THE MOTHERS OF THE WEST. 1. The mothers of our Forest-Land! Stout-hearted dames were they; With nerve to wield the battle-brand, And join the border fray. Our rough land had no braver In its days of blood and strifeâ Aye ready for severest toil, Aye free to peril life. 2. The mothers of our Forest-Land! On old Kentucky's soil, How shared they, with each dauntless band, War's tempest, and life's toil! They shrank not from the foeman, They quail'd not in the fight, But cheer'd their husbands through the day, And sooth'd them through the night. 3. The mothers of our Forest-Land! Their bosoms pillow'd MEN; And proud were they by such to stand In hammock, fort, or glen; To load the sure old rifleâ To run the leaden ballâ To watch a battling husband's place, And fill it should he fall. 4. The mothers of our Forest-Land! Such were their daily deeds: Their monumentâwhere does it stand? Their epitaphâwho reads? No braver dames had Spartaâ No nobler matrons Romeâ Yet who or lauds or honors them, Ev'n in their own green home? 5. The mothers of our Forest-Land! They sleep in unknown graves; And had they borne and nursed a band Of ingrates, or of slaves, They had not been more neglected! But their graves shall yet be found, And their monuments dot here and there âThe Dark and Bloody Ground!â VI. The plaudits that rose from the many, And the chatter that fell from the few, Were silenced ere long by a trumpet, Which peal'd out the âRed, White and Blue;â And then, oft with tremulous cadence, And tones that made holy the air, From the hall came this song of a sorrow Among the Green Hills of Adairâ The violin measuring fitly The depth of the feeling express'd, And the method and voice of the singer Soon winning the heart of each guest:â AMONG THE GREEN HILLS OF ADAIR. 1. How oft in the spirit we yearn For faces and forms that have fled! While the calm lights of memory burn, How oft from the living we turn To the dead! So my thoughts now go wandering back, O'er a quiet and shadowy track, Till they rest by a murmuring stream, Where in years gone I dream'd a sweet dream, Among the green hills of Adairâ The beautiful hills of Adair. 2. And a maiden, as sweet as the flowers That bloom'd by that murmuring stream, Walk'd beside me among the wild bowers, Through the months, and the days, and the hours, Of that dream. But a messenger cruel as Death Broke in on that dream, and her breath Pass'd away with a prayer and a sigh, As that murmuring stream glided by, Among the green hills of Adairâ The beautiful hills of Adair. 3. But I wander there yet, and I hear The tones of that murmuring stream; And the form and the face that were dear, In the beauty of youth re-appear; And I dreamâ Oh, I dream of a Land and a Life, Lying far beyond earth and its strife, Wherein, not again to be cross'd, I shall find the sweet spirit I lost Among the green hills of Adairâ The beautiful hills of Adair. VII. The refrain had scarce died to a murmur, When a woman well stricken in years, Sang the song of Lynn's Station on Beargrass, In tones that brought many to tears:â LYNN'S STATION ON BEARGRASS. I. As the clouds and the shadows are lifted, And roll from my vision away, Lynn's Station appears on the Beargrass, With the green groves around it that lay; And I see gallant forms and sweet faces, Such as brightened a day that is o'er, And my ear catches faint and far echoes Of voices I'll hear never-moreâ Never-moreânever-moreâ Loved voices I'll hear again never, Never-more. 2. Now my mind and my heart, in their fullness, Wander back to the days that have been, And my breast swells and throbs with emotion, Over memories of girlhood and Lynn. Although dangers there threaten'd us often, Man's strong arm was a shield and a spear; And woman's true heart made it stronger, As she bravely sang out, âNever fear!â Never fear!ânever fear! Though the strong win not always the battle, Never fear!â 3. And now I behold Nannie Allen, Who was kill'd in her maidenly bloom, And her gallant young lover, John Martin, Who in tears and alone dug her tomb. On a green grassy knoll, by the river, O'erlooking the Falls far below, In the flush and the flower of her beauty, We laid her to rest long agoâ Long agoâlong agoâ And the winds and the waves sang her requiem, Long ago. VIII. The tones of the violin lingered, As if they were part of the air, Impregning the place with the holy And beautiful spirit of prayer: Ere long, though, the murmur was broken By a resonant clarion blast, And before the enraptured assembly The host and the hostess pass'd. On their taking position together, The clarion ended its playâ And he sang then this song of their Love-Life In Kentucky's old Pioneer-Day:â LOVE-LIFE ON THE ELKHORN. 1. We met first 'mid the horrors of battle, While rang the red savage's yell, Where some of our boldest and bravest By rifle and tomahawk fell. She stood by the door of a cabin, Unshrinking, determined and grand, From a loophole surveying the struggle, An axe duly poised in her hand. 2. I bridled a steed that was halter'd In a shed that stood haply behind, And pointing the way that was safest, She mounted and rode like the wind. With night the fierce battle was over, And we cared for our wounded and slain, Yet till peace spread its wings o'er Kentucky In beauty, we met not again. 3. But peace brought the triumphs of labor, And scattered the shadows of gloom, And the green fertile shores of the Elkhorn Soon revel'd in beauty and bloom. And then, as if heaven-directed, We met where that cabin once stood, And walk'd hand-in-hand where our heroes Had gone down in battle and blood. 4. And we met there again, and there plighted Our faith to each other for life; And never on earth yet has Heaven Dealt kindlier with husband and wife. And in memory now we together Go back where that cabin once stood, And thank God that soon out of the evil We witness'd and shared, came the good. IX. At the close came kind words and good wishes From all, that were fervent and true; And the drum and the fife and the trumpet Pealed out again, âRed, White, and Blue!â Then came, floating in from the porches, A smother'd and twittering hum, And the young clapp'd their hands as they shoutedâ âThe Pioneer Legion has come!â And a dozen in buckskin-breeches, By hunting-shirts overhung, Walk'd in under caps of 'coonskin, And saluted both old and young; And they beat then the stately marches Of time, on the notes of the years, As they sang, to a fitting melody, The Song of the Pioneers:â THE SONG OF THE PIONEERS. 1. A song for the Early Times Out West, And our green old forest-home, Whose pleasant memories freshly yet Across the bosom come: A song for the free and gladsome life In those early days we led, With a teeming soil beneath our feet, And a smiling Heav'n o'erhead! Oh, the waves of life danced merrily, And had a joyous flow, In the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago! 2. The hunt, the shot, the glorious chase, The captured elk, or deer; The camp, the big bright fire, and then The rich and wholesome cheer:â The sweet sound sleep at dead of night, By our camp-fires blazing highâ Unbroken by the wolf's long howl, And the panther springing by. Oh, merrily pass'd the time, despite Our wily Indian foe, In the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago! 3. We shunn'd not labor: when 't was due We wrought with right good will; And for the homes we won for them, Our children bless us still. We lived not hermit lives, but oft In social converse met; And fires of love were kindled then, That burn on warmly yet. Oh, pleasantly the stream of life Pursued its constant flow, In the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago. 4. We felt that we were fellow men; We felt we were a band, Sustain'd here in the wilderness By Heaven's upholding hand. And when the solemn Sabbath came, Assembling in the wood, We lifted up our hearts in prayer To God the only Good. Our temples then were earth and sky; None others did we know, In the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago! 5. Our forest-life was rough and rude, And dangers closed us round; But here, amid the green old trees, Freedom was sought and found. Oft through our dwellings wintry blasts Would rush, with shriek and moan; We cared notâthough they were but frail, We felt they were our own! Oh, free and manly lives we led, Mid verdure, or mid snow, In the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago! 6. But now our course of life is short; And as, from day to day, We're walking on with weakening step, And halting by the way, Another Land more bright than this, To our dim sight appears, And on our way to it we all Are moving with the years. Yet while we linger, we may still Our backward glances throw, To the days when we were Pioneers, Fifty years ago! X. The Wedding-Feast followed.â... ... When evening Had quietly yielded to night, The grove at the front was found blazing, Every tree with its lantern a-light. And soon from a garlanded terrace, The viol and trump made their din, Giving place, as the company gather'd, To the notes of the gay violin. Then the Country-Dance answered with spirit To old Rosin's familiar appeal, And Cotillions glode on, through the Gallop And Waltz, to Virginia's old Reel. And the Past and the Present there mingled, As the old and the young thus met, That day throughout life to remember, And that night never, never forget. XI. Thus ended that Golden Wedding, An hour ere the dawn of day, On the Rolling Fork of Hardin, In the flowery month of May; And before the bright sun had risen All the guests their couches press'd, By the murmur of winds and waters Gently wooed, and lull'd to restâ All but one, whom the chains of memory Held so firm in their thraldom still, That a link ev'n had not been broken By the waltz, or the lithe quadrille: And from him, as the host and hostess At length their chamber sought, A low and tremulous murmur Their ears for a moment caught; And soon, as they paused to listen, They heard, low-toned but free, This song of an old log-cabin On the Banks of the Tennessee:â ON THE BANKS OF THE TENNESSEE. 1. I sit by the open window And look to the hills away, Over beautiful undulations That glow with the flowers of Mayâ And as the lights and the shadows With the passing moments change, Comes many a scene of beauty Within my vision's rangeâ But there is not one among them That is half so dear to me, As an old log-cabin I think of On the banks of the Tennessee. 2. Now up from the rolling meadows, And down from the hill-tops now, Fresh breezes steal in at my window, And sweetly fan my browâ And the sounds that they gather and bring me, From rivulet, and meadow, and hill, Come in with a touching cadence, And my throbbing bosom fillâ But the dearest thoughts thus waken'd, And in tears brought back to me, Cluster round that old log-cabin On the banks of the Tennessee. 3. To many a fond remembrance My thoughts are backward cast, As I sit by the open window And recall the faded pastâ For all along the windings Of the ever-moving years, Lie wrecks of hope and of purpose That I now behold through tearsâ And of all of them, the saddest That is thus brought back to me, Makes holy that old log-cabin On the banks of the Tennessee. [4.] Glad voices now greet me daily, Sweet faces I oft behold, Yet I sit by the open window, And dream of the times of oldâ Of a voice that on earth is silent, Of a face that is seen no more, Of a spirit that falter'd not ever In the struggle of days now o'erâ And a beautiful grave comes pictured Forever and ever to me, From a knoll near that old log-cabin On the banks of the Tennessee. III. In Exaltis. I. The Portico. I. There is a temple, not made with hands, That out in the broad blue firmament stands. From the silence and shade of its Portico, I lookt out o'er the landscape that lay below:â Green, meadowy reaches, in light that ran To the edgings of brown where groves began; With here-and-there, now miss'd, now met, The silvery line of a rivulet, That up from its fringing greenness glanced, As into the thickets and out it danced; And away, but indistinct and dim, On the broad savanna's farthest rim, Embowered in beauty, what seem'd to be The dwellings of men, all tranquilly Reposing in fields around them spread, As calm as the heav'n that arch'd o'er head. II. And over the greenness, and over the brown That fell from the groves like a mantle down, Soon spread a mystical glamour, born In part of the night, in part of the morn, Whose soft, warm colors, drifting by, Lay anon like mist on the mind and the eye; And visions of wonder, half fear'd, half enjoy'd, Floating up, sailing on, fill'd that mystical void. As I lookt, still, and marvel'd, I felt round me fall The gloom of the cloud that now rests on us allâ The wing of the shadow, the weight of the frown, That in Eden with words of upbraiding came down; And out of the distance and darkness stole in Troubled sounds; and then o'er the bewildering din, Breaking through the sweet songs of the brooks and the trees, Rose this Wail, floating up on the breath of the breeze:â WAIL OF HUMAN SPIRITS. 1. Disenthrall'd, we yet linger: not of earth, we are here: And we move in the Mystery yetâyear after year. Like a sunbeam from Darkness to Light we were bornâ But our breath pass'd away with the mists of the morn. 2. Like the grass of the field, ere the seed is yet brown, We were markt for the scythe, and cut ruthlessly down: Like the flow'r of the grass we were wafted awayâ And the Night came before we well knew it was Day. 3. In the Mystery still do we grope; and we fight With vague shades in a void that ne'er promises light, And yet never brings darkness: we linger, and grope, And despair never comes, yet we never know hope. 4. It is never so dark but that shadows we see: It is light enough never from darkness to flee: The silence oppresses, bewilders, confounds, Yet less than the voices, which never are sounds. III. The air labor'd heavily. Shadowy forms, Like those that oft marshal the quick-coming storms When Aries or Libra full-haloed appears, And rules o'er the earth from the path of the spheres, Came and went. Then the winds, as appall'd, held their breath, And the forms that they bore became quiet as death: E'en the woods ceast to murmurâthe brooks to rejoiceâ And all life lay in trance, without motion or voice. âOf a sudden, the cry of the bittern was heard, And the earth in the breath of the hurricane stir'd: Then the air for a moment grew thick, and again The clouds, like a fleet of ships caught on the main In the sweep of Euroclydon, wildly were driven And tost like the sea-foam, until the pale heaven Shone faintly between them, and smiled on the path Which the hurricane's breath had just swept in its wrath. Then quiet came back, and the sun, and the breeze; And the brooks sang again to the winds and the trees. IV. Soon chants as of triumph, though not as of war, Stole thrillingly in from the silence afar; And this Song of the Seraphim, borne from above, Where no mutterings of Hate mar the anthems of Love, Took the place of the Wail of distrust and despair, And with harmony fill'd every wave of the air. SONG OF THE SERAPHIM. 1. Up, where the King of Glory sits, Here where His People have their homes, Never the wing of a shadow flits, Never the wail of a sorrow comes: But the glimmer of stars, and the gleam of the sun, And the light that streams from the high white Throne, Shine while the heavenly anthems run, Where angels the words of Love intone. 2. Out of the mists, and above the din, Here, where the King of Glory reigns, Never a shadow enters in, Never a troubled voice complains: But angels sing the Song of the Lamb, Whereat the Trail of the Serpent ends: And the Voice of the high-enthroned âI Amâ A hope for man through the ages sends. 3. Up where the King of Glory sits, Out of the mist, and above the din, Never the wing of a shadow flits, Never a sorrow enters in: But light and love, and prayer and praise, And charity that all invites, Make up the measureless, endless days, The days of heav'n, that know no nights. V. And the arching groves responsive rang, As the heav'nly chorists soar'd and sang; And out of the soft South-Western Land A freshening breeze came in, and fan'd The mists to motion, and toucht the trees To joyous and beautiful harmonies. Then cloudlets form'd, and sail'd away Like tilting ships on a rolling bay; And over the landscape, erewhile dun, Flasht brightly the beams of the slanting sun; And the splendor and beauty of earth and sky. Reflecting the Majesty throned on high, Proclaim'd, as the glory spread abroad, The goodness and power and love of God. II. The Temple. I. 'T was a beautiful, bright, bland Autumn Day. A Sabbath hush on my spirit lay. I had heard the Sermon, and bow'd in prayer, And laid my heart to its Maker bare. I had eaten the fat of the fruitful land, And given God thanks for His liberal hand. I had turn'd from Pilate, and sicken'd, to Christ, And wept o'er the Life he sacrificed. I had lookt on the proud, on the meek, on the lowly, And thought of the Sabbath, âto keep it holy.â I had walkt with the Savior in Galilee And felt doubt, and confusion, and darkness flee. II. Then I enter'd that Temple, not made with hands, That out in the broad blue firmament stands. By the âRock of Ages,â in its midst I stood; and I said in my Soul: âThou didst, Oh God! this temple build for Man: And in it he worshipt ere yet began The pomp and pride of the synagogues, And the boastful structures hewn of logs And of granite and marble; and long ere yet The mosque arose, and the minaret. âIf then and thus Thou didst let him bow, And worship, wilt Thou forbid him now?â III. Whilst the waving woods, and the whispering breeze, Fill'd the arching groves with their symphonies, I rose; and I felt that the Spirit of God Fill'd the Temple He founded, high and broad; And I said in my soul, as I gazed up above, 'Tis a Spirit of liberty, light, and love, And of mercy, and goodness, and beauty and truth.â And the Faith of my Age to the Hope of my Youth Cried aloud: âThou hast said it! 'tis as thou hast said!â And again to that Spirit I bow'd down my head, And I worshipt. âOh God! if this worship be not What Thou willest,â I cried, âset thy sign on this spot!â IV. And I worshipt, and waited. I got not a sign; But the Spirit of Peace rested on meâwas mineâ And I worshipt, and waited. No Horebâno bush, Burning voicefulâno Sinai, with thunders. The hush, Though, that came over nature, around and above, Fill'd my breast with devotion, with rapture, with loveâ And I worshipt, and waited. Then came unto me, In the depths of my spirit, with tones like the sea, This only: âThe Temple that arches abroad, Over all, is the House of the Living God!â And then this, as to Christ all the Centuries ran, And this only: âThe Sabbath was made for Man!â V. And I cried out: âOh man! to the house of prayer Made with hands, go upâfor thy God is there; And, in the days of thy beautiful youth, Bow down, and worship in spirit and truth; In the mightier years of thy ripening age, There still against Sin in the battle engage: But say not of him who goes out and stands In that grand old Temple not made with hands, And hungers and thirsts, and worships and waits, And for righteousness longs and supplicates, That he errs: for Christ and his Cross are there, And God's Angels come to him unaware.â VI. Then I thought of Jacob, by Isaac sent Afar into Haran, and then, as he went, Of the ladder at Bethel, whereon in the night Moved the Angels of God, in their vestments of light; Of the Spirit, with purpose benign and strong, That at Penuel met Jacob, and wrestled long; And then of the Voice that so often spoke To Moses, who broke the Egyptian yoke; Of the Ravens that fed, in his sore distress, Elijah prone in the Wilderness; And the hungry hosts, that on manna fed, And by unseen hands were comforted. VII. And I thought of the Dove that came to Christ, When he rose from the water, by John baptized; Of the Mountain of Light, and the Shining Cloud, And the Voice that out of it spoke aloud; Of the Light that arrested and startled Paul On his way to Damascus down; and the call That then shook his soul; and the thick, dull night, That lay on his eyes when withdrew that Light; Of the Tones that at Corinth bade him âCease Not thou, nor fear, nor yet hold thy peace;â And of all sights and sounds, of the earth and air, Which proclaim thatââGod is Everywhere!â III. The Gardens of Nature. I. I rambled o'er the meadow-lands; I walkt along the river:â The sun was shooting golden shafts From out his autumn quiver; The slanting arrows hit the waves, Refracted, and ascended, Till in the shimmering air above With gathering mists they blended. Effulgent glory clothed the sky, A billowy blaze the river, And still the golden arrows sped From out their autumn quiver. I thought of God and Paradise, Of Christ and the Hereafter, Till rous'd by children, hurrying by From play, with songs and laughter. II. I mounted then the river hills, And lookt down in the valleys:â The beech-trees stood in shining clumps; The maples ranged in alleys; The gum here plumed the sloping way, With ampelopsis twinings; While not far off the monarch oak Hung o'er the sumach linings. The hill-sides, bright with autumn hues, Now challeng'd the near heaven, Along whose curves the golden clouds To silvery shafts were driven. But neither put such glory on As clothed the gleaming river, Where still the sun's swift arrows set The gathering mists a-quiver. III. The frost had done its artist-work:â Bright leaves, around me falling, Blent their low rustle with the tones Of distant voices, calling The cattle from the fields below. I heard the sweet bells tinkle, As homeward wound the kine. I saw The ferns and mosses sprinkle My winding pathway down the slope With more than earthly graces. I heard aloft the freshening winds, And saw below their paces; And soon I felt my new-strung nerves With pleasure stir and tingle, As banks of clouds, with sunset fill'd, Came blazing up the dingle. IV. Dazed with the beauty, long I stood, As 't were 'twixt earth and heaven, And gazed with wonder. âAnd all this,â I said, âO man! was given, In the beginning, unto thee: Yet thou didst scorn the Giver!â No more. There was no more to say! ... Far up the rounding river I saw the city's steeples shine: I knew what lay around them; I knew the people's pride and sin; I knew the chains that bound them; And, turning from all this, I gazed Once more on earth and heaven, As up from off the gleaming waves The freshening winds were driven. V. The sun set. O'er the darkening stream The twilight shadows gather'd; No longer danced in light the plumes With which the hills were feather'd; The cottages in shadow lay; In shadow lay the meadows; And up the darkening dingle's sides Like phantoms crept the shadows. From farms I heard the peacock's cry, The bittern's from the river; The city's bells, I thought, rang outâ âDeliver! oh, Deliver!â And now the heavens outshone the waves, The hill-tops, and the hollow, For crimson glory sail'd the curves Where'er the eye could follow. VI. I took my homeward way. In dusk It lay, far up the dingle; And dusky thoughts I felt come up, And with my fancies mingle. The cottages lookt brown: I saw The darkening shadows win them; But, as I pass'd, the lights of home Shone cheerfully within them. The barn-yards lookt like graves, which here And there white slabs besprinkle; But, passing, I arous'd the flocks, And heard the sheep-bells tinkle. A wild, dark thicket, far ahead, Each step was nearer bringing; But, when I reacht it, deep within Its heart a thrush was singing. VII. So, on I went. And as I pass'd, Each shade had its bright lining; And to my heart I said: âOh, heart! Now cease thy much repining! If what thou wantest, cometh not To-day, await the morrow; And if to-morrow barren prove, Still hold thee from thy sorrow:â For it was sure the cottage homes Had lights within to twinkle; And it was sure the folded flocks Had bells that soon would tinkle; And it was sure the thicket's heart Would yet with song be ringing; And so of thine! No more repineâ But wait the Future's bringing.â [IV] The Happy Valleys. I. I sat, far in the evening, My heart and soul aglow, With some cherisht tokens by me Of the crowded âLong Ago.â I had drawn them from recesses Held as sacred as my truth, Some with manhood's shadows on them, And on some the lights of youth: And I noted, as life's periods Came together thus from far, That the brightest had its cloudlet, And the darkest had its star. II. My whole life spread out before me, Like a crowded map unroll'd: With the free, wild, summery boyhood, The staid manhoodâformalâcold; All the dreams, that never would be, Though I nurst them, aught but dreams; The realitiesâhardâflintyâ And with iron in their seams; The glad voices, that are ringing Even yet, like marriage bells, And the low, sad tones, still telling What the dirge forever tells:â III. All spread out before my vision, And stole in upon my brain, Till I lived my life all overâ With its pleasure and its pain. And I askt myself: âNow was it, To all others, or to you, Worth the living, for the little It enabled you to do?â And myself replied: âBy Heaven, Not by man, are we approved. For myself, I hold it ample To have lived, and to have loved. IV. âFor âall others,â the man liveth Not, whose judgment I accept. Who assails me, let him show me That he hath himself not slept At his post, when all around him Moved the foe that robs and killsâ The arch-enemy, who filleth The broad earth with all its ills. By the judgment that 's of Heaven, Though its vision may appall, In my strength, or in my weakness, I will stand, or I will fall!â V. To a livelier sense of being, With this answer I was stir'd: But the dusk within my chamber Soon again my vision blur'd; And the loved and long-departed All came back to me againâ And the living loved were moving In the bright and shining train. Though my life knew many sorrows, I had cause for much delight: Yet my thoughts all took their color From my chamber and the night. VI. And around still troopt the shadows Of the living and the dead, Till the voice of the last departed, In the old tones, sweetly said: âIn the land beyond the living, In the light beyond the sky, That is where the Happy Valleys Of the dear departed lie. When the golden bowl is broken, And the silver cord is shred, We shall meet there all together, You the living, we the dead. VII. âThere are trials still, and sorrows, Where the Serpent left his Trail, But the true and trusting spirit Will not falter there, or fail. In the Book of Books 't is written, By the Light that is the day, âBut my Word, though all else perish, Shall in no wise pass away;â And that Word contains the Promise, That the weary heart shall rest Where the Happy Valleys whiten With the Mansions of the Blest.â IV. Life Pictures. The Mightier Realm. âA SAILORS YARN,â AS REPEATED BY THE CAPTAIN. I. There was once a Queen named Dido, In a realm of the ancient time, Who sail'd the sea, right royally, With a purpose deem'd sublime: But she sank to the deep sea's bottom The wealth of that ancient realm; For her woman-sway was supreme that day, And her hand was on the helm. II. By the coast of a foreign people, In that reckless time of old, Her anchors she castâand to land she past, With a spirit free and bold: But the royal city she founded, And builded, and peopled there, Soon became the scene of a spirit the Queen Could neither control nor bear. III. So she parley'd for time to ponder; And the people soon saw arise By the sounding sea, what proved to be An altar of Sacrifice: And on this the hand that had striven To hold and control the helm, With desperate art thrust a blade to her heart; And thus perisht the Queen of that realm. IV. There is now a Queen named Dido, In a realm of the modern timeâ A realm that lies 'neath serener skies, And with purpose more sublime: And this Queen has a pet named Fidoâ A marvelous, mischievous thing, Who proposed once to sail,âthough he 'd only a tailâ And to take the Queen âunder his wing.â V. But she knew that she couldn't trust himâ For he 'd neither a wing nor a sail To respond to the helm; and her beautiful realm Might perish thus in the gale: Yet she allowed him still to advise herâ And he workt on her fancy oft, Till she thought she could feel the lift of the keel And see the white sails spread aloft. VI. The dog and the Queen one day were seen Looking very much discontented; And it seem'd that they had quarrel'd that day, But the good Queen had relented. Fido complain'd that Dido reign'd Too much in her own dominions: She should look all about, and spread herself out, And then try abroad her pinions. VII. He could hardly be blinded: She was surely âStrong Minded,â And ready for self-abnegation. The world, quite benighted, Could hardly get righted, Without her active co-operation; But if she were once there, âIt didn't much matter where, Nor much matter what the distanceâ All things would go right, Both by day and by night, For no one would think of resistance. VIII. So the Queen took a notion, she 'd cross the broad ocean, âThis marvelous Queen named Didoâ And with her she 'd take, just for company's sake, Her marvelous pet, named Fido. And they two went to sea, right ambitiously, And big with their mighty Endeavor, And raised the shout, as their sails swelled out, âOh, Woman is Queen forever!â IX. She stood at the helm of her new-found realm, âThis wonderful woman, Didoâ And steer'd the ship with a firm-set lip; While high on the poop stood Fido, Watching the seas as the rising breeze Drave the vessel on before it, But fearing a wreck when he saw on the deck How the wild waves tumbled o'er it. X. The Queen was brave; and, as on they drave, She grew stouter and stouter hearted: âBlow high! blow low!â she sang out, âI'll go On the venture for which I started.â âBut what of your course?â shouted Fido, hoarse, And trembling with great emotion; For he felt the ship give a duck-like dip, As they entered the open ocean. XI. The Queen now felt in her broad bright belt, And her fingers made quite a rumpus: âI have brought the chart, which I knew by heart, But I left behind the compass!â âThen helm a-port!âor our time is short On this marvelous, mighty ocean!â Shouted Fido out, as he glared about And saw nothing but huge commotion. XII. âBlow low! blow high!âthrough sea or sky I'll sail, and sail forever, Till face to face I stand, in the place I sail'd for, with my Endeavor!â Sang out the Queen, in a pause between, The wind's rage and the water's: (So like the way, when from Home they stray And its realm, of Earth's fair daughters.) XIII. Just then the ship gave a terrible dip; Yet, when it came up, still righted; But its sails were split, and in ribands slit, And Fido yelled out affrighted; And the Queen, though bold, was wet and cold, For some icebergs drifted near her, And she saw the mane of the Hurricane, As he shook it, clear and clearer, Then felt its dash in her face, and the crash Of the masts, as they fell about her: But her woman-form still braved the storm, And her woman-heart grew stouter. XIV. Then struck the ship on the ice! .... The dip Of an oar was all, thereafter, She knew till her form lay quiet and warm In a fisherman's hut; and a rafter That met her dull eye, held her clothing to dry; And the fisherman's wife and his daughter Like angels sat by her, and kept up the fire, And ministered to her, and taught her The virtues and beauties of Home, and its duties, And the kindness that took in a stranger, And gave her the best that it had, and the rest She required, and saved her from danger, And death. And she swore, as she thought it all o'er, That never again would great Dido, âThe wonderful Queen of this wonderful sceneâ Be led into folly by Fido! XV. âI saw the white speck, as she stood on the deck!â Said the sailor, with honest emotion; âAnd I wisht myself there, near the Hurricane's lair, For I know all his haunts on the ocean. Had she known but enough to have given a âluff!â And close to the wind held the vessel, Her bold woman form might have weather'd the storm, For her soul was full-up to the wrestle! As she lookt at the foam, on each billow's dark comb, Her own hands by the helm-wheel bound her; And she mockt at the gale till it split every sail, And the spars lay in ruins around her. But what right had SHE on the deck, and at sea, With that beautiful form by the helm? The hand fell in vain on the Hurricane's mane Which at Home ruled a mightier realm!â XVI. The captain lookt mad at the first, and then glad, At the sailor's outspoken emotion; And after a while he sang out, with a smile: âNow hear me, my brave Son of the Ocean!â And he lookt like a man whose thoughts inwardly ran, Ere he gave them the force of expression; For he shielded his bright, beaming eyes from the light, With their lashes, and made no digression:â XVII. âI find in Dido, and her pet Fido, The Woman and her Ambition: The one that's twoâthe False and True! The outward, seen condition, Of inward fires, and wild desires, That burn and tempt while hidden: The mastering greed that yearns to feed On fruit to her forbidden: The reckless haste to cross the waste Which man finds dark and dreary. The stubborn will, that struggles still, Though foil'd, and faint, and weary: The quenchless thirst that bids her burst Through all restraints e'er taught her, That she may stand in some new land And drink untasted water: The wish to go out to and fro, Beyond the usual ranges, And there to see what can not be Till natural usance changes. XVIII. âMy mind fills with regret, whenever it's set On Woman and these conditions; For could she but adhere, in her beautiful sphere, To its holy and beautiful missions, As I know in the main she does, and refrain From the world's outer toil and strife, Oh, how much more bright with affection's light And love, would be her Life! XIX. âBut the wild emotion that yearns for the ocean, Where Man contends with Might, And the false ambition that seeks attrition With him, in fields where the fight Goes on of parties, whose frequent art is Deception, and theft, and fraud, Bring roughly down the beautiful Crown Of Peace she wears from God! XX. âWith all this not so, she can sweetly go On her missions of Home Endeavor, And Man's heart sing out, as she moves about, âOh, Woman is Queen forever!ââ Woman. IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF A COPY OF âLUCILE,â PRESENTED BY A FRIEND. I. In the highways of Life, here and there, now and then, Amid muslin call'd ladies, and buckram call'd men, One meets, though the race is now hardly styled human, A man that 's a man, and a woman that 's woman. Such scorn not to drink of the waters of truth, That flow, pure and cool, from the fountains of youth; Nor reject, for roast beef and plum-pudding, the meal Fitly season'd and served by the hand of Lucile. II. Lucile! oh thou sweetest of self-immolators That e'er walk'd the walks of the world in French gaiters; Thou purest of Sisters, and bravest of Nuns, Thou should'st have borne daughtersâthou should'st have left sons: But failing of theseâperhaps Life's lesser partâ Thou still hast left offspring that sprang from thy heart, Having just enough falsehood truth's force to reveal, And just enough art art's device to conceal. III. It is trueâis it not?âthat the beings we know As the beings of mind, are the beings that flow From nearer the sources of trial and truth, From nearer the fountains of freshness and youth, Than the beings of muslin and buckram we meet In the gilded saloon, or the church, or the street. The alembic of Genius from which they proceed,â From the sickness and sin of humanity freed, From the gloss of its crime, and the grime of its error, From its frenzy, it fume, its despair, and its terror,â Gives existence to purer and loftier lives Than are borne to most husbands by most of their wives. IV. Then hail to Lucile! contemplate her! look at her! And hail to the power that conceived herâbegat herâ Took her out from fair Parisâfrom Badenâanon Built her chalet far up the slopes of Serchonâ Fill'd her sweet eyes with flow'rs and her pure heart with chimes From the bird and the brook, and the bee and the limesâ Bade the thunders to speak, and the cataracts roll Their grand diapason through the depths of her soulâ Gave a voice to the pinnacled solitudes there, That was just less than worship, and just more than prayerâ To the pallor of age brought the rose-bloom of youth, Clothed the passion of Love with the fashion of Truthâ In the man of the world found and unmask'd the true man, Through the mind and the might of the self-sustain'd womanâ Set a spirit afloat on the wave, on the breeze, And a living soul gave to the lone Pyrenees. V. Ah, LucileâAlfred VargraveâEugene de Luvoisâ If well âput on the stage,â what âlarge housesâ you'd draw! But as given to the page of Life's prophet, the Poet, You draw better still, and the âtrade salesâ all show it. From which I conclude,âas I'm certain I may,â That the world has still some men and women who pay Willing tribute to all that ennobles the race, And due homage to woman whene'er she displays The uplifting emotions, the purposes high, The unchanging resolve or to do or to die For the truth of the tongue, and the faith of the heart, Which we feel were Lucile'sâwhich Lucile could impart. VI. âWoman's strength is her weakness,â men often declare: Just as muchâand no moreâSamson's strength was his hair. Woman's strength is her virtueâher willâher desire For man as her Lord. Not as something that's higher, But stronger; as something to which she was sent, To be bone of his bone, and, in full complement, To be flesh of his flesh. The old Edenal story, In making which true is her prideâis her glory; For making which true she has longings. Her life, Left at least incomplete without being a wife, And a mother, looks lovingly forward to these High and holy accomplishments, just as the trees And the vines that bear fruit, forward look for the wall Which the latter must lean on and cling to, and all The soft rains and warm winds and bright sunshines that bring In their train the full beauty that 's born of the spring; With the bud and the bloom of the former, that shoot, And fructify soon, and accomplish the fruit. VII. Woman's strength is, her virtueâher willâher desire: Man's weakness is, not to be influenced by her High hopes, patient waitings, long labors for good For herself and for all, half as much as he should. Look at Alfred Vargraveâat Eugene de Luvois! How keenly she felt, and how clearly she saw, âShe, the woman Lucileâwhile perhaps all were sinning, All three, against fortune or fate, the beginning Of troubles whose path would be strewn with the wrecks Of love and of hopeâirremovable checks To all present designs, or desiresâevery-where, In its course, folly, frenzy, defeat and despair. She, the woman Lucile, saw it soonâsaw it allâ Knew the lightning would flash, and the thunder-bolt fallâ Felt the shallowsâthe reefâheard the roarâsaw the rockâ Gave warning again and again: but the shock Came the same; and the dark and the desolate shore, And the paths that led to it, and the water that bore For a time the frail barges of love and of hope, That so recklessly sail'd up the hyaline cope, Were strewn with the wrecks she had dreaded, foreknown, And foreseen, and foretold of. All light was her own, All prudence, all warning, all wisdom, all kindness: But against her were passionâfatuityâblindnessâ That knew not, that saw not, that heard not, that reck'd not! And who, like to them, just such fate may expect not? VIII. Woman's strength is her virtueâher willâher desireâ That exalt her, sustain her, forbid her to tire. The priestess of Nature, interpreting God, She is like much that Nature spreads grandly abroad. Yet she 's not the strong river that flows to the sea; Nor the wild waste of waves that engulph it, is she; But the vine that clings close to the husbanding wall, Having faith it will not be permitted to fallâ Neither it nor its fruit. She's the angel that brings Down the jewels of heav'n to the crowns of earth's Kings. Though unheeded so oft, she 's the voice that to man Speaks as not e'en the voice of an archangel can. IX. Woman's strength is her virtueâher willâher desire For a love that is purerâa life that is higherâ A truth that is surerâa faith that is strongerâ A hope that is brighterâa charity longer, And broader, and deeper, and oh! much benigner: With an impulse that ever incites her to twine her White arms and sweet purposes round what is pure, And serene, and unselfish, and sinless and sure. What the rose to the garden, the leaf to the tree, And the grass to the plains, to man's mansion is she. Like the sun to the earthâlike the stars to the skiesâ She 's the warmth of his love, and the light of his eyes. But she 's more than all this: she 's companion, friend, wifeâ Without whom man might live, Butâwould living be Life? The Maniac. I. âWho walks by yon thicket of hazel and thorn, Her hair all disheveled, her looks all forlorn?â â'Tis Mary, the Maniacâharmless, though wildâ Her constant companion yon flow'r-seeking child.â âAnd what is her story? I pray you relate.â â'Tis simpleâand many are doomed to her fate, Or worse, for from self shrinks the bosom that errs, But oblivion of thought is eternally hers. II. âFew words will suffice to rehearse you her tale.â Once Mary was fairest of all in our vale; And the bloom on her cheek, and the glance of her eye, Shamed the flow'rs of the earth, and the stars of the sky. But there came to our vale, from the sunny South-West, A youth who beheld her, and fondly address'd. He wooed her, he said, as a fair forest flower, Which he long'd to transplant to his far-away bower. III. âHe wooed her with looks and with promises dear; He wooed her with words the most honeyed to hear; He wooed her in gladness, he wooed her in tears, And employ'd each expedient to quiet her fears. He call'd her the star of his being, whose ray Could alone gild the gloom of life's perilous way; He call'd her the sun of his spirit, whose light Could alone win him back from doubt's wildering night. IV. âHe call'd her his idol, his gloryâthe shrine Where he knelt with a worship was all but divine; He call'd her,âfor words to his false lips came free,â All man could e'er covet, or woman e'er be. Touch'd, conquer'd, she rais'd up the low-kneeling youth, For she knew not that falsehood is smoother than truth; And his words on her ear like a melody fell, Till her spirit was bound in a wildering spell. V. âShe listen'dâand gone were her coyness and pride; She lovedâand with his flow'd her heart's gushing tide; And at once seem'd her whole glad existence to be Lost in his, as a river is lost in the sea. From that moment her life was a trance or a dream, And as tranquilly flow'd as some meadow-marged stream Which is lull'd with the breath of sweet flow'rs, and the song Of bee or of bird, all the summer day long. VI. âBut 't was like that same stream, had one wave of its breast Been defiled at the fountain to poison the rest; And 't was like that same stream, were its course in the path Which a hurricane soon was to sweep in its wrath. She awoke from that dream, to the light of the truth; But in ecstasy still clung her heart to that youth; For to him all her love, worship, rapture, was giv'nâ Her world now, her idol, her glory, her Heav'n! VII. âOft they stray'd by yon thicket: a bird carol'd there A song that sooth'd Mary, and wiled her of care; And still, though six summers have journey'd along, She roves to that thicket, to listen its song. But I wander:âWeeks pass'd; and the Frost Sprite came by, With iris like colors, all fresh from the sky; And the leaves,âin one clear, starry night, all was done,â Gleam'd scarlet and gold in the sheen of the sun. VIII. âAutumn vanish'd; chill Winter's approaches were heard; And gone was the song of that caroling bird, Which so long had enchanted the forest and glade; And gone was the Wooer of Mary the Maid. He left her with fear and with trouble oppress'd, To seek his rich home in the sunny South-West,â Where, he told her, he'd meet with their wood-chorister, Whose song should aye 'mind him of first love and her. IX. âHe'd a mother to win to his purpose, he said, And a father to soften before he could wed; But he'd leave ere their bird from the South should be flown, And return with its spring-song to make her his own. The winter months pass'd, in their darkness and gloom; But the forest tho' bare, and the flow'rs in their tomb, Were less desolate far than was Mary's torn breast, For she heard not one word from the sunny South-West. X. At length, where the Winter King rush'd in his wrath, Came spring, and sweet blossoms sprang up in her path; And the leaf started out from each bud-burden'd spray She breath'd on, while holding her life-giving way. Then back to the thicket return'd that fair bird, And again, morn and eve, its sweet carol was heard; But the wooer of Mary, who with it had gone, Came not with its spring-song to make her his own. XI. âDay pass'd after dayâweek on week journey'd byâ And a dark shade was gathering on Mary's blue eye: Still Hope, sweet deceiver! supported her frame, And flatter'd her heart, though he hid not its shame. But the Spring pass'd away: and the Summer's breath blew On a cheek which was sunken, and pallid of hue; And a desolate bosom in loneliness beat, Of tempests of grief and self-torture the seat. XII. âMary's tongue was now fill'd with her false Wooer's name, But the poison-lipp'd spoiler anear her ne'er came; And she sank, for her grief knew nor changing nor check, In body and reason a ruin and wreck. She rose from her couch with an eye fierce and wild, But gentle whenever it turn'd on her child; And that child is the only companion she hath, To lighten the gloom of her desolate path. XIII. âAll else, though six summers have journey'd away Save it, and the warbler of life's fairer day, She shuns; but to listen that thicket-bird's song, She wanders there often, and loiters there long. And sometimes as sudden as thought does she start, With fix'd eyes, and check'd breathing, and thin lips apart, And looks all bewildered,âas if she had heard A tone of the Past in the song of that bird. XIV. âBut the spell passes off with a word from her child, And she looks on it kindly, a moment though wild: Then it leads the poor Maniac home o'er the vale,â As now.âAnd such, stranger, is Mary's sad tale.â âA curse on the Spoiler!â I muttered. âOh, heaven! Can he go unscourg'd while his victims 's thus riven? No! Passion's fierce tempests must rage in his breast, And his heart find a hell in its sunny South-West!â XV. Oh Womanâdear Woman! how often betray'd By the blandishments sweet that won Mary the Maid! How often, too yielding! led on to prepare, By one moment of rapture, an age of despair! Beware! for the tones the most fervid and sweet, Are oft but the mask of the deepest deceit,â As oft the wild flowers that lure with their breath, Conceal the coil'd serpent, whose venom is death! Mabelle Golding. Maple Golden,â the servants called her: She was the wildest, merriest thing, That ever rambled the woodlands over To search for flowers in the early Spring. The March-rime, even, did not escape her; And when the April violets came, Her eyes were filled with the hues of heaven, And her cheeks with roses were aflame. Maple Golden 's come back, Missus! It 's just three years since she went away. No longer a girl, she is now a woman, And her beautiful hair is streak'd with gray. But she 's changed so, Missus! You'd hardly know her, She looks so weary, and seems so sadâ She that was never down in spirits, She that was always fresh and glad. The matter? I did n't hear 'bout the matter; I saw her only a little while, Just as she left the car at the Station; And I should n't have known her but for her smile; That is, at first I should n't have known her, And did n'tâbut when I looked agen, And saw her fondle and kiss the children, I 'd a-known her among a thousand then! âAt first she stood like the marble statue I saw at Muldoon's the other day; Then the smile that all of us used to love so, Across her features began to play; And then, for just a moment, she buried Her face in her hands, and press'd her eyes,â (They are not the same, but the stars are in them, As they used to be, and the blue of the skies,)â âAnd half-look'd into the group of children That stood but a little way from her, All of them wanting to rush up to her, But each afraid to be first to stir; And then she look'd them full in their faces, And caught them up to her, one by one, And kiss'd them and press'd them up to her bosom, And named themâall but little Nun: âNun, you know, has come among us Since that terrible, awful day, When, in the storm we all remember, Maple Golden wandered awayâ Wandered away, no one knew whither, And only a few have ever guess'd why; And none have become a whit the wiser, In all the time that has since gone by. âI know, Missus! and al'ys did know, For I was where I could hear and see; But I 've been good to Maple Golden,â She sigh'd, âfor Maple was good to me. And I have kept my own good counsel, And mean to keep it as long as I live: Many have ask'd me to give them a hint just, But I 've no hint that I'll ever give.â âWont you tell me now, Phillis? me just? Soon your secret'll all be out. When and where and how did it happen? What and with whom was it all about?â âNoâI'll never tell on Mapleâ Maple'll never tell on me: To such as I am it 's little differenceâ It 's all, though,â she sighed, âto such as she!â âPlease do n't ask me again, dear Missus. Maple's wells of sorrow are dry; I judge by her looks, and by her movements, But more than all by her burning eye. Yet were this not so, Maple should never Have cause from me one word to fear. I wish she could weep, but she shall not ever For fault of mine shed a single tear.â âWell, Phillisâwhen you left the Station, WhatâââMissus, here comes Massa John. When I turn'd away from Maple Golden, He stood near, looking sadly on. May-be he can tell you something, Missusâ Something I miss'd cause I did n't stay. Mass John! you saw poor Maple Golden, And was looking on when I came away.â âWell, JohnâI can't get much out of Phillisâ Has Maple, sure enough, come back?â âYesâthe poor thing wandered hither, somehow, But has gone again, on a darker track. Things do happen so strangely, sometimes! Her father had been for a week in town, And return'd on the up-train half an hour After she on the other train came down. âI saw her standing and gazing wildly At little Nun, till she spied a charm, Which seem'd almost to electrify her, By Nature fix'd on Nun's right arm. At this she caught the child to her bosom, And gave it many a sweet embrace, Smoothing its hair with her trembling fingers, And planting kisses all over its face. âThe upward train then stopp'd at the Station, Near where Mabelle stood with the child; And her father stepp'd from the car to the platform, And bow'd to a friend or two, and smiled; When, all of a sudden, Mabelle toward him With open arms and a wild look sprang, And for an instant a shriek came from her, With which the air all about us rang. âHe caught her tenderly, and drew her Beautiful form up to his own, And kindly and lovingly address'd her, But she answer'd with only a dying moan. She was borne then gently into the Station, And laid for a little while on a bed; But ere I leftâââOh God!â cried Phyllis, âAnd is poor Maple Golden dead?â âDead ere I left.â âPoor Maple Golden!â Sobb'd Phillis; âI know her story well; 'T is a tale of guilt, and a tale of sorrow, But a tale that Phillis can never tell. Mass JohnâââAh, Phillis! I know that story, And I know of one whose robes are white As he moves on earth, but whose soul is blacker Than the blackest shades of the darkest night. â'T is the old, old story, of woman's weakness, And of the perfidy of man!â Go, Phyllis, at once, to Mabelle's parents, And offer to do whatever you can. Say nothing of what you do or don't know; Help lay that blighted flow'r in the earth; And all who know of Mabelle's Temptation, Will pray for her second and better birth.â Over âThe Bridge of Sighs.â âOver âthe Bridge of Sighs,â Into the land that lies Under the brightening skies That glow with the coming dayâ That is where I would go, Out of this land of woe, Whose evil I see and know. It is far, ah! far away, That land of beauty and light; But I feel in my spirit the might That, cheered by its gladdening smiles, Can compass the weary miles: So, over the Bridge I go, Bring it weal now, or bring it woe!â She said. And her voice grew loud, And her step grew firm, and proud Her bearing, and keen her look, As her self-will'd way she took; And, giving but one glance back On the long and weary track, She pass'd the Bridge, and in pride Stood erect on the chosen side. âNow out from the Bridge of Sighs Into the land of Hope, With brightening heart and eyes, And a clearer horoscope!â She said. And into the land Of Hope, with a quickening pace, She wentâand she took her stand In a sunny and flowery place: A place that forever was bright, In the morn or the noon or the night, With the golden and silvery light That streams from the stars and the sun: A place that forever was sweet With the breath of the flow'rs at her feet That bloom'd, and adown by the run: And she walk'd through the days and the hours Of months, by the light and the flowers; But Hope she then found was a cheatâ Bewildering her mind, and her feet Misleading, till day after day She threaded the same weary way, Coming back with the shadows of night To the place she had left with the light. âAnd now, from the land of Hope, I go to the land of Deeds: Whoe'er with the world would cope, Must lean not on broken reeds!â She said. And she fix'd her eye On a beautiful cloud in the sky; But that cloud soon moved away, And was lost ere the close of the day. Then from the horizon afar Rose a bright and a beautiful star: âBy that I can travel right on!â She saidâand she started. Anon It had changed so its place in the sky, That she murmur'd, with tears and a sigh, âIf I follow much farther its track, Whence I started I soon shall be back.â In the morning she fix'd her bright eyes On the sun as it rose, and the skies That were gleaming with purple and gold As the cloudlets away from it roll'd. And with confidence now she began Every object around her to scan. But the sun, like the star and the cloud, Proved a foil to her hopeâand she bowed Her head for a moment, then gazed At a tall cliff before her that blazed In the light of the moon, and blazed on Till the beams it reflected were gone. That landmark went into her dreams, Through the long and the wearisome night, With its height and its strength and its beams, And the shimmering sheen of its light; And when the sun rose the next day, It caught and threw back his first ray. Then, proudly uplifting her head, She gazed at it calmly, and said: âAgain I shall fix not my eyes, For guidance by night or by day, On what moves in the air and the skies; But by objects that rise far away On the earth, and by objects anear, Will I measure my distance, and steer; And for that which is righteous and just, I will place my full faith and my trust In a region of beauty that lies Far beyond the thin air and the skies!â And she did so; and thence moved in pride, Life's highways and byways alongâ Faith and Works being ever her guide, Trust and Triumph her prayer and her song; And, o'ercoming earth's trials and strife, She won in the Battle of Life. Song of âThe Knitting Girl.â Late in the quiet night, By the warm coal-fire I sit, My hand and my heart both light, And I knitâI knitâI knit. And sometimes I interweave A thought over which I grieve; And then comes a gentle gleam Of a beautiful light, and I dreamâ I dream of a time to come, But my voice and my lips are dumbâ And I think of a time now gone, And a walk on the terraced lawnâ But all these soon disappear, With a smile, or a sigh, or a tear, And, joyous or sad or oppress'd, With the midnight I slumber and rest. The shadows soon upward roll, âBoth night's and mine,âand the day Comes down with its open scroll, Which I read as it glides away: 'T is the same I have read before, But I ponder it o'er and o'erâ 'T is the same I shall read again, In sorrow, or joy, or pain, As the labor of life goes onâ But the goal will at last be won; And I wait, as it comes more near, With a smile, or a sigh, or a tear, Now working, and now at play, Never doubting the Better Day: So here by the fire I sit, And I knitâI knitâI knit. V. Miscellaneous Poems. Proem. God's holy angels, when the Earth was new, Ere yet green plant or golden grain had birth, O'er the warm slopes and sunny valleys threw The germs of vegetation; and the earth, As lapsed the seasons of the primal year, Grew fair and fruitfulâyielding, for all time, The sustenance of Lifeâafar and near, On every continent, in every clime. No quick return was part of this great plan: But thus the seed was sown for all the Years of Man. And, by this high and bright example taught, Would I thus labor in my lowly wayâ Sowing the broad and shining fields of Thought With seed that shall spring up through many a day: Not seeking quick returns, in wealth or fame; Not darkening counsel with unmeaning words, Nor dazzling with a phosphorescent flameâ But with a voice as cheerful as a bird's, And with a hand and heart unaw'd by strife, Singing and sowing seed for all the Years of Life. The West. I. Land of the Westâgreen Forest-Land! Clime of the fair, and the immense! Favorite of Nature's liberal hand, And child of her munificence! Fill'd with a rapture warm, intense, High on a cloud-girt hill I stand, And with clear vision gazing thence, Thy glories round me far expand: Rivers, whose likeness earth has not, And lakes, that elsewhere seas would be,â Whose shores the countless wild herds dot, Fleet as the winds, and all as free; Mountains that pierce the bending sky, And with the storm-clouds warfare wage,â Shooting their glittering peaks on high, To mock the fierce red lightning's rage; Arcadian vales with vine-hung bow'rs, And grassy nooks, 'neath beechen shade, Where dance the never resting Hours, To music of the bright cascade; Skies softly beautiful, and blue As Italy's, with stars as bright; Flow'rs rich as morning's sun-rise hue, And gorgeous as the gemm'd midnight. Land of the Westâgreen Forest-Land! Thus hath Creation's bounteous hand, Upon thine ample bosom flung Charms such as were her gift when the gray world was young. II. Land of the West!âwhere nought is old, Or fading, but tradition hoary,â Thy long neglected annals hold Of many a daring deed the story! Man's might of arm hath here been tried, And woman's glorious strength of soulâ When war's fierce shout rang far and wide, When vengeful foes at midnight stole On slumbering innocence, and gave Nor onset-shout, nor warning word, Nor nature's strong appealings heard From woman's lips, to âspare and save Her unsuspecting little one, Her only childâher son! her son!â Unheard the supplicating tone, Which ends in now a shriek, and now a deep death-groan! III. Land of the West!âgreen Forest-Land! Thine early day for deeds is famed Which in historic page shall stand Till bravery is no longer named. Thine early day!âit nursed a band Of men who ne'er their lineage shamed; The iron-nerved, the bravely good, Who neither spared nor lavish'd bloodâ Aye ready, morn, or night, or noon; Fleet in the race, firm in the field, Their sinewy arms their only shieldâ Courage to Death alone to yield: The men of Daniel Boone! Their dwelling placeâthe âgood green wood,â Their favorite hauntsâthe lone arcade, The murmuring and majestic flood, The deep and solemn shade: Where came to them the Word of God, When Storm and Darkness were abroad, Breath'd in the thunder's voice aloud, And writ in lightning on the cloud. And thus they lived: the dead leaves oft, Heap'd by the playful winds, their bed; Nor ask'd they couch more warm or soft, Nor pillow for the head, Other than fitting root or stone, With the scant wood-moss overgrown. Heroic band!âBut they have pass'd As pass the stars at rise of sun,â Melting into the ocean vast Of Time, and sinking, one by one; Yet lingering here and there a few, As if to take a last, long view, Of the domain they won in strife With foes who battled to the knife. Peace be to those who sleep beneath us! All honor to the few that yet do linger with us! IV. Land of the West!âthine early prime Fades in the flight of hurrying Time; Thy noble forests fall, as sweep Europa's myriads o'er the Deep; And thy broad plains, with welcome warm, Receive the onward-pressing swarm: On mountain height, in lowly vale, By quiet lake, or gliding river,â Wherever sweeps the chainless gale, Onward sweep they forever. Oh, may they come with hearts that ne'er Can bend a tyrant's chain to wear; With souls that would indignant turn, And proud oppression's minions spurn; With nerves of steel, and words of flame, To strike and sear the wretch who'd bring our land to shame! V. Land of the West!âbeneath the Heaven There 's not a fairer, lovelier clime; Nor one to which was ever given A destiny more high, sublime. From Alleghany's base to where Our Western Andes prop the skyâ The home of Freedom's hearts is there, And o'er it Freedom's eagles fly. And here,âshould e'er Columbia's land Be rent with fierce intestine feud,â Shall Freedom's latest cohorts stand, Till Freedom's eagles sink in blood, And quench'd are all the stars that now her banners stud. A Hymn of the Day that is Dawning. If the promise of the Present Be not a hollow cheat, If true-hearted men and women Prove faithful and discreet, If none falter who are hoping And contending for the Right, Then a time is surely coming, As a day-beam from the nightâ When the landless shall have foothold In fee upon the soil, And for his wife and little ones Bend to his willing toil: When the wanderer, no longer In sorrow forced to roam, Shall see around him spring and bloom The blessÃ¨d things of Home: When the poor and widowed mother Shall fit recompense obtain, For her days and nights of toiling, From the sordid man of gain: When the brawny limbs of labor, And the hard and horny hand, For their strivings, for their doings, Meet honor shall command: When suffering hearts that struggle In silence, and endure, Shall receive, unsought, the earnest Ministrations of the pure: When the master with his bondmen For a price shall divide the soil, And the slave, at last enfranchised, Shall go singing to his toil: When the bloody trade of the soldier Shall lose its olden charm, And the sickle hand be honored more Than the sword and the red right-arm: When tolerance and truthfulness Shall not be under ban, And the fiercest foe and deadliest Man knows, shall not be man. Be firm, and be united, Ye who war against the wrong! Though neglected, though deserted, In your purpose still be strong! To the faith and hope that move ye In the things ye dare and do, Though the world rise up against ye Be resoluteâbe true! Truth and Freedom. On the page that is Immortal, We the pregnant promise see: âYe shall know the Truth, my people, And the Truth shall make you free.â For the Truth, then, let us battle, Whatsoever fate betide! Long the boast that we are Freemen, We have made, and published wide. He who has the Truth, and keeps it, Keeps what not to him belongs; But performs a selfish action, Which his fellow-mortal wrongs. He who seeks the Truth, and trembles At the dangers he must brave, Is not fit to be a Freeman:â He, at best, is but a slave. He who hears the truth, and places Its high promptings under ban, Long may boast of all that 's manly, But can never be a Man. Friend, this simple lay who readest, Be not thou like either of them; But to Truth give utmost freedom, And the tide it raises, stem. Bold in speech, and brave in action, Be forever!âTime will test, Of the free-soul'd and the slavish, Which fulfills life's mission best. Be thou like the noble Ancientâ Scorn the threat that bids thee fear; Speak!âno matter what betide thee; Let them strike, but make them hear! Be thou like the first apostlesâ Be thou like heroic Paul: If a free thought seek expression, Speak it boldly!âspeak it all! Face thine enemiesâaccusers; Scorn the prison, rack, or rod! And, if thou hast Truth to utter, Speak! and leave the rest to God. Conservatism. The Owl, he fareth well In the shadows of the night; And it puzzleth him to tell Why the Eagle loves the light. Away he floatsâaway, From the forest dim and old, Where he pass'd the gairish day:â The night doth make him bold! The wave of his downy wing, As he courses round about, Disturbs no sleeping thing That he findeth in his route. The moon looks o'er the hill, And the vale grows softly light; And the cock, with greeting shrill, Wakes the echoes of the night. But the moonâhe knoweth well Its old familiar face; And the cockâit doth but tell, Poor fool! its resting place. And as still as the spirit of Death On the air his pinions play;â There 's not the noise of a breath As he grapples with his prey. Oh, the shadowy Night for him! It bringeth him fare and glee; And what cares he how dim For the Eagle it may be? It clothes him from the cold, It keeps his larders full; And he loves the darkness old, To the Eagle all so dull. But the dawn is in the Eastâ And the shadows disappear; And at once his timid breast Feels the presence of a fear. He resists;âbut all in vain! The clear Light is not for him; So he hastens back again To the forest old and dim. Through his head strange fancies run; For he can not comprehend Why the moon, and then the sun, Up the heavens should ascend,â When the old and quiet Night, With its shadows dark and deep, And the half-revealing light Of its stars, he 'd ever keep. And he hooteth loud and long:â But the Eagle greets the day, And, on pinions bold and strong, Like a roused Thought, sweeps away! The Laborer. Stand upâerect! Thou hast the form And likeness of thy God!âwho more? A soul as dauntless 'mid the storm Of daily life, a heart as warm And pure as breast e'er bore. What then?âThou art as true a MAN As moves the human mass among; As much a part of the Great Plan That with Creation's dawn began, As any of the throng. Who is thine enemy?âthe high In station, or in wealth the chief? The great, who coldly pass thee by, With proud step and averted eye? Nay! nurse not such belief. If true unto thyself thou wast, What were the proud one's scorn to thee? A feather, which thou mightest cast Aside, as idly as the blast The light leaf from the tree. No:âuncurbed passionsâlow desiresâ Absence of noble self-respectâ Death, in the breast's consuming fires, To that high nature which aspires Forever, till thus checked: These are thine enemiesâthy worst; They chain thee to thy lowly lotâ Thy labor and thy life accurst. Oh, stand erect! and from them burst, And longer suffer not! Thou art thyself thine enemy! The great!âwhat better they than thou? As theirs, is not thy will as free? Has God with equal favors thee Neglected to endow? True, wealth thou hast not: 't is but dust! Nor place, uncertain as the wind! But that thou hast which, with thy crust And water, may despise the lust Of bothâa noble mind. With this, and passions under ban, True faith, and holy trust in God, Thou art the peer of any man. Look up, thenâthat thy little span Of life may be well trod! RadicÃ¡los. In the far and fading ages Of the younger days of earth, When man's aspirations quicken'd, And his passions had their birthâ When first paled his glorious beauty, And his heart first knew unrest, As he yielded to the tempter That inflamed and fill'd his breastâ When the Voice that was in Eden Echoed through his startled soul, And he heard rebuking anthems Through the heavenly arches rollâ When he fell from the high promise Of his being's blessÃ¨d morn, To a night of doubt and struggleâ RadicÃ¡los then was born. Through the ages long and dreary That since then have dawn'd on earth, Man has had but feeble glimpses Of the glory of his birth: Catching these, his soul, aspiring To its morning light again, Hard has upward toil'd, and often Fill'd with hope, but still in vain. Many a blessÃ¨d song comes stealing Downward from the Eden aisles, Whence the light of heavenliest beauty Still upon the banish'd smiles; But the harmonies are broken Of each sounding choral hymn, And the gloom that vails his spirit Makes e'en heavenly splendor dim. Faint revealings, thwarted hopings, Wearying struggles, day by day:â So the long and dreary ages Of his life have worn away. War, and rapine, and oppression, Early in his course he foundâ Brother against brother strivingâ By the few the many bound. And in patience,and in meekness, To the galling chain resign'd, Thus the fettered limbs have restedâ Thus hath slept the darkened mind. But it wakens now!âit flashes Like the lightning ere the rain; And those limbs grow strong!âwhen ready, They can rend the mightiest chain. Through the slow and stately marches Of the centuries sublime, RadicÃ¡los hath been strengthening For the noblest work of Time; And he comes upon the Present Like a god in look and mien, With composure high surveying All the tumult of the scene: Where obey the fettered millions; Where command the fettering few; Where the chain of wrong is forging, With its red links hid from view; And he standeth by the peasant, And he standeth by the lord, And he shouts âYour rights are equal!â Till earth startles at the word. He hath seen the record written, From the primal morn of man, In the blood of battling nations O'er ensanguined plains that ran; In the tears of the deluded, In the sweat of the oppress'd From Ind's farthest peopled borders To the new worlds of the West. And he cometh with deliverance! And his might shall soon be known, Where the wrong'd rise up for justice, And the wrongers lie o'erthrown. Woe! the pride that then shall scorn him: He will bring it fitly low! Woe! the arm that shall oppose him: He will cleave it at a blow! Woe! the hosts that shall beset him: He will scatter them abroad! He will strike them down forever! RadicÃ¡los is of God. The Artisan. The day is past;âthe quiet night Toward its midhour weareth on; His workshop has been closed for hoursâ A good day's labor done. The toil is hard that brings him bread; And sometimes he has scant supply: When droops awhile his manly head, And glistens his full eye. Yet from the trial shrinks he not; For he has youth, and strength, and will; And though his toil is ill repaid, Bends daily to it still. He sometimes murmurs,âbut his pride Checks each expression at its birth,â That blessings to his class denied Surround the drones of earth. He passes, morn and noon and night, The homes of luxury and wealth; And glances at their gilded ease, His eye will take by stealth. And shadows gather on his face, At timesâbut instantly departâ He feels such weakness a disgrace Both to his head and heart. His calling sometimes takes him where Wealth, worth, grace, beauty, all unite; And lovely tones arrest his ear, And lovely looks his sight; And much he thinksâand half he sighsâ Yet ere his welcome work is done, He longs for home, and Mary's eyes, And for his prattling son. His labor hath been light to-day; And wife and child before him sleep; And he has pass'd the half-spent night In study close and deep. The lamp burns dimâthe fire is lowâ The book is closed wherein he read; But wildly swell the streams of thought Its fountain-pages fed. With eyes fixed calmly on the floor, But varying and expressive face, He cons the lesson o'er and o'erâ The history of his race. And much he finds of word and deed, Whose virtue is example now; But more that makes his bosom bleed, And darkens o'er his brow. The thirst for wealth,âthe strife for powerâ The ceaseless struggle for renownâ The daring that hath seized a realm, Or caught a wavering crownâ The manhood that hath tamely bent And fall'n beneath tyrannic swayâ The balk'd resistance, that hath lent Its darkness to the day. But chiefly this it is that fills The swelling volume of his mind: The countless wrongs and cruelties That have oppress'd his kind. And viewing them, upon his brain His own hard struggles darkly throng; And as he feels their weight again, It presses like a wrong: Wrong to himself, and wrong to all Who bear the burdens he hath borne: âA yoke!â up starting he exclaims, âAnd oh, how meekly worn!â But as he reads Life's riddle still, He feels, with sudden change of mood, The stern, the indomitable will, That never was subdued. The will, not to destroy, but build! Not the blind Might of old renown, Which took the pillars in its grasp, And shook the temple downâ But that whose patient energy Works ever upward, without rest, Until the pierced and parted sea Rolls from its coral breast. In the dim fire-light, for awhile, His tall form moveth to and fro; Then by the couch of those he loves He stops, and bendeth low. Oh, holy love! oh, blessÃ¨d kiss! Ye ask not splendorâbide not pow'râ But in a humble home like this, Ye have your triumph hour! He sleepsâbut even on his dreams Obtrudes the purpose of his soul; He wanders where the living streams Of knowledge brightly roll; And where men win their own good ways, Not yield to doubt or dark despair, In dreams his bounding spirit straysâ In dreams he triumphs there. With stronger arm, with mightier heart, Than he hath felt or known before, When comes the morrow's hour of toil, He'll leave his humble door. No wavering hence he'll knowâno rest, Until the new-seen goal be won; But firm, and calm, and self-possess'd, Bear resolutely on. And this it is that, year by year, Through which nor faith nor hope grows less, Pursued, shall crown his high career With honor and success. Thisâthis it is that marks the man! Dare thou, then, 'neath whose studious eye This lesson lies, rouse up at once, And on thyself rely! Give to thy free soul freest thought; And whatsoe'er it prompts thee do, That manfully, year in, year out, With all thy might pursue. What though thy name may not be heard Afar, or shouted through the town, Thou 'lt win a higher meed of praise, A worthier renown. Press on, then!âearth has need of thee! The metal at the forge is red; The ax is rusting by the tree; The grain hangs heavy in the head. Heed not who works notâlabor thou! Lay bravely hold, nor pause, nor shrink! Life's Rubicon is hereâand stand Not dubious on the brink! The New Age. RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDUSTRIES OF THE UNITED STATES. As, to one who stands a watcher by the solemn-sounding sea, Rise from the elliptic waters mighty ships continually, With the race whose type is constant, though its outer-seemings range, As the civilizations widen, o'er the boundless fields of change: So, to one who gazes thoughtful, from the lessening shores of time, O'er Eternity's expanses, silent, limitless, sublime, Rise the marvelous, mighty ages, rounding up the shadowy spheres, With the eternal laws of order, and the changes of the years. Standing where the graceful vessel cleaves the ocean and the sky, Where the starr'd and mighty centuries sweep with matchless grandeur by, Let me, while upon my vision coming changes brightly throng, Sing the age's Jubilateâsing the Worker's Triumph Song. JUBILATE. I. Hearken, human brotherâho! Worker at the board or bench, High aloft the window throwâ Let escape the stew and stench; Air like that in these shut rooms, Foul and damp with lingering glooms, Do the best with it you can, Is not fit for lungs of man. Though the walls that rise about Shut the blessÃ¨d sunlight out, Yet the sweet and liberal air Wanders freely everywhere. 'Mid the darkness, 'mid the din, Lift the sash, and let it in! Thick upon your pallid brow Stand the reeking sweat-drops now: Thicker still upon your face Lines of anguish interlace. Wipe away the honest sweat; Proud of it you shall be yet! Banish, too, the lines of painâ Human toil is not in vain! Work and waitâ't will yet be Day; Long the task, but work away! II. Striker at the anvil, ho! You are all begrimed and hot; Still you strike a mighty blow; Let your spirit falter not! Brace your sinewsâplant your footâ White the skin beneath the soot: Turn the ironâstrike it wellâ Every blow at last will tell. Soon your clear or subtle thought In the metal shall be wrought; Soon the forge's glowing heat, And the hammer's ringing beat, So shall shape the iron rod That 't will work for man and God; So, too, shall your blow on blow Bring the hour you long to know. Clutch the ironâheat it hotâ Be of spiritâfalter not. Like its glow shall be your Day; Work with will, and work away! III. Mighty molder, hist and ho! Down there in your earthly halls, Like the metal all aglow, How the sweat from off you fallsâ Dripping with each heave or stroke, As the rain drips from the oak! Still the mold you well prepareâ Still the molten metal bearâ Still the casting comes out true: Mighty molder, it will do! Only when the eve shall lay Aside the labors of the day, And unto your wife you've come, Sit not with her gloomyâdumb: Look not sadly on her boys: Dash not thus her matron joys: Give to each and all a hope: Strength and will with fate can cope. As you bring the mass aglow, You can bring or weal or woe; As you mold or shaft or wheel, You can mold or woe or weal. You have strength to make the Dayâ Work with will, then: work away! IV. Worn and weary workersâho! Toil is pain, if so you say; But to those who singing go To their labors day by day, Toil is duty, growth and gainâ Never wastedânever vain. Worker by the hot highway, In the blinding blaze of dayâ Delver in the deep, dark mine, Where no rays of sunlight shineâ Patient, pent-up man-machine, At the loom and shuttle seen, Weaving in with nicest art Throbbings of your own poor heart, Till the subtle textures seem With your very life to gleamâ Stitcher by the cradle's side, Where thy fondest hopes abide, Working with a heart of might All the day, and half the night, Sometimes till the east grows red With the dawning, for thy bread, Though thou art of feeble limb, And thine eyes are pain'd and dim, Sending off, with every piece Which thy weary hands release, Portions of thy life wrought in With the garment white and thinâ Hard the task, but work away: Yet shall dawn the Better Day. V. Faith is might, my brothers. Ho! Weary workers everywhere, For the New Age, rounding to Like a planet, now prepare: Not by revelânot by rustâ Not by scorning yet your crustâ Not by idle dreams of wealth Won by luck, or got by stealthâ Not by flattering hopes of ease: Better, braver things than these, As its first beams on you fall, Asks the New Age of you all. Workers! ye are brothers bornâ Treat the title not with scorn. Workers! born or where or when, Better, ye are fellow-men: Workers!â(so 'tis felt at length)â Ye have got the gift of strength: Yours the gift of numbers, too, âThen what?â To yourselves be true! Work with will, and work away, Doubting not the Better Day! Each to each a brother beâ Steadfast in your sympathy; All to all be fellow-men; Ye will lack but little then. âWe were made for Labor?â True, So was labor made for you. You are Labor's: Labor yours; This your common weal secures. Labor has been Money's long; And in this has been the wrong. Let it hence be yours, and you Labor's. Then, with duty due, And with muscles well combin'd With your energies of mind, Workers! ye shall masters be In the halls of Industry. Heart and hope! The night withdrawn, How the coming morn shall dawn! Work, my brothersâwork away, Doubting not the Better Day! VI. âHeart and hope!â my brothers. Ho! Sons of sorrow, sons of toil, Ye shall not forever go Yoked, as nowâanother's spoil. See! the night is nearly pass'd, And the morning dawns at last. Far behind, the shadows lie Dark against the troubled sky; While, before, the arch is gray Where the harbinger of day, Rounding up the azure cope, Flames the Morning Star of Hope. âBe not hasty, be not rash, Though its beams around you flash: Time his offspring will matureâ Work and waitâthe end is sure. Falter not, but bide your time: Calm endurance is sublime. âWeary workers! work away: God will lead the Better Day! All Things Free. Free as the air, free as the sea, Let all things come, let all things be: The air, at every start and pause, That still confesses natural lawsâ The sea, that ever ebbs and flows, And still the laws of nature knows. Free as that air's sky-cleaving bird, Whose songs at Heav'ns blue gates are heard Ere sunbeams tip earth's loftiest peak, Let all things move, let all things speakâ For laws divine or human reach, Or may, and wisely govern each. Free as the sea's careering ships, Whose arrowy speed the wind outstrips, As o'er the broad and boundless deep, Unaw'd, unchain'd, but helm'd, they sweep, Let all things be, as all things canâ And first, and chief of all things, MAN. Be Firm!âBe True! ... âAs the sun, Ere it has risen, sometimes paints its image In the atmosphere, so often do the spirits Nativism: exclusionâForeign influence: home Catholicism: anti-poperyâPapal pretensions: protestant intoleranceâUltra democracy: aristocratic republicanism. Of great events stride on before the eventsâ And in to-day already walks to-morrow.â SchillerââWallenstein.â Statesman! on the giddy height Whence, at will, thou swayest men, Steals a darkness o'er thy sight? Moves a cloud within thy ken? Be firm!âBe true! And though the hurtling heav'ns grow black, Unfailing light shall gild thy track. Orator! amid the crowd Moved like waves at thy behest, Hear'st thou that which, shouted loud, Were a terror to thy breast? Be firm!âBe true! Then fall what may upon thine ear, Thy heart shall feel no coward fear. Christian! of the faith of Rome! Do you hear a hissing scorn Rising 'gainst you, in the home Of your new-adoption born? Be firm!âBe true! If God is with you, what care ye Though hate roar as a raging sea? Christian! of the faith that laid Rome's old bondage in the dust! Fear'st thou that thou art betray'd? Feel'st thou that this quarrel's just? Be firm!âBe true! Fall if it must be in the strife, But yield not thou one inch for life! Stranger! from a clime abroad, From a land beyond the sea, Deem'st thou in thy heart that God Gives a home-right here to thee? Be firm!âBe true! And though it cost thee all thou hast, Assert that right while life shall last. Freeman! born upon the soil! Fully, fairly, deemest thou Alien arts would make a spoil Of this land of freedom now: Be firm!âBe true! Resolve on what will shield from harm, And do it with no laggard arm! Man! of every clime and creed! With a high and holy trust, Dost thou on thy mission speed, Seeking but the Right, the Just? Be firm!âBe true! Though sorely tried in many a way, Despair not!âGod will bring thy Day. Spring Verses. How with the song of every bird, And with the scent of every flow'r, Some recollection dear is stirr'd Of many a long-departed hour, Whose course, though shrouded now in night, Was traced in lines of golden light! I know not if, when years have cast Their shadows on life's early dreams, 'T is wise to touch the Hope that's past, And re-illume its fading beams: But, though the future hath its star, That olden Hope is dearer far. Of all the present, much is bright; And in the coming years, I see A brilliant and a cheering light, Which burns before me constantly,â Guiding my steps, through haze and gloom, To where Fame's turrets proudly loom. Yet coldly shines it on my brow; And in my breast it wakes to life None of the holy feelings now, With which my boyhood's heart was rife: It can not touch that secret spring Which erst made life so bless'd a thing. Give meâthen give me birds and flow'rs, Which are the voice and breath of Spring! For those the songs of life's young hours With thrilling touch recall and sing,â And these, with their sweet breath, impart Old tales, whose memory warms the heart. To an Early Spring Flower. First of the fruitful Springtime! welcome thou, Beautiful pioneer of the Floral World! As the bright, high-soul'd ones of human kind, Go forth into the boundless wilderness Fearless and first; and on the trackless deep, Adventurous, dare the surge which ne'er before Has curl'd and crested to the streaming flag; The while unmindful of their toils severe, And perils that encompass them: So thou, Herald of after-coming multitudes, Darest the chill and blighting storms of March, And spread'st thy cheerful petals to the eye, Regardless of the cloud that, stooping low, Frowns darkly on thee, and with muttered threat Spreads its thick folds between thee and the sun. To me, dear art thou, herald flower! No rich, And gaudy coloring, hast thou: thy leaves Have not the rainbow-brightness, nor the deep And dazzling hue of those which throng the earth In summer, to the hot and burning sun Opening their bosoms: But thou hast a tint More delicate by far; and to the eye Pleased with the simply beautiful, thou art More grateful than the gaudily attired. E'en as the beautiful of human-kind, Who live not in the blaze of Fashion's sun, Nor waste their early years at Folly's shrine, âWhere Nature's glorious handiwork is warp'dâ Are by the good of earth respected most, And pleasantest to the All-seeing Eye. Dandelions. My heart leaps like a child's, when first I see them on their lowly stem, As from still wint'ry fields they burst, Bright as the blue skies over them, Sprinkling with gold the meadowy green, Where Spring's approach is earliest seen. They come in changeful April days, These children of the cloud and sun, When light with shadow softly plays, As both along the ridges run, Wooing the bee from out his cell, With tales of flowery slopes they tell. Bright horologe of seasonsâthey Proclaim the floral calends here, Revealing when in woods away Spring flowers and singing birds appear, Through open aisle and mazy bout To lure the feet of childhood out. I love them that so soon they spring Where slopes the meadow to the brook; I love them that to earth they bring So cheerful and so warm a look; And that again they give to me The playmates of my infancy. O! days of love, and trust, and truth; (The morning sky is strangely bright!) O! loved companions of my youth; (How darkly closes in the night!) Again the fields spread free and far; Beyond them, still the woodlands are. I'm with you now, glad-hearted ones! Where'er beneath the April sky The flashing rill in music runs, Or flowery lawns in sunlight lieâ Where harvest apples ripe we see, And where the summer berries be. I'm with you where the cardinal bird Pipes in the budding groves of spring, And where the thrasher's song is heard Till all the summer forests ring; Where nuts in autumn fall, and where The wild grape hangs, I'm with you there. O! days of love, and trust, and truth; (The flowers were bright upon the lawn!) O! loved companions of my youth; (How many, like the flowers, are gone!) Nor flower nor child goes down in vain: Ye both shall rise and bloom again. May. Would that thou couldst last for aye, Merry, ever-merry May! Made of sun-gleams, shade and showers, Bursting buds, and breathing flowers! Dripping-lock'd, and rosy-vested, Violet-slipper'd, rainbow-crested; Girdled with the eglantine, Festoon'd with the dewy vine: Merry, ever-merry May, Would that thou couldst last for aye! Out beneath thy morning sky! Dian's bow still hangs on high! And in the blue depths afar, Glimmers, here and there, a solitary star. Diamonds robe the bending grass, Glist'ning early flowers amongâ Monad's world, and fairy's glass, Bathing fount for wandering spriteâ By mysterious fingers hung In the lone and quiet night. Now the freshening breezes passâ Gathering, as they steal along, Rich perfume, and matin songâ And quickly to destruction hurl'd Is fairy's diamond glass, and monad's dewdrop world. Lo! yon cloud, which hung but now Black upon the mountain's brow, Threatening the green earth with stormâ See! it heaves its giant form, And, ever changing shape and hue, But still presenting something new, Moves slowly up, and spreading rolls away Toward the rich purple streaks that usher in the day; Bright'ning, as it onward goes, Until its very center glows With the warm, cheering light, the coming sun bestows: As the passing Christian's soul, Nearing the celestial goal, Bright and brighter grows, till God illumes the whole. Out beneath thy noontide sky! On a shady slope I lie, Giving fancy ample play; And there 's not more blest than I, One of Adam's race to-day. Out beneath thy noontide sky! Earth, how beautiful!âhow clear Of cloud or mist the atmosphere! What a glory greets the eye! What a calm, or quiet stir, Steals o'er Nature's worshiperâ Silent, yet so eloquent, That we feel 't is heaven-sentâ Waking thoughts that long have slumber'd Passion-dimm'd and earth-encumber'dâ Bearing soul and sense away, To revel in the Perfect Day That 'waits us, when we shall for aye Discard this darksome dustâthis prison-house of clay! Out beneath thy evening sky! Not a breeze that wanders by But hath swept the green earth's bosomâ Rifling the rich grape-vine blossom, Dallying with the simplest flower In mossy nook and rosy bowerâ To the perfum'd green-house straying, And with rich exotics playingâ Then, unsated, sweeping over Banks of thyme, and fields of clover! Out beneath thy evening sky! Groups of children caper by, Crown'd with flowers, and rush along With joyous laugh, and shout, and song. Flashing eye, and radiant cheek, Spirits all unsunn'd bespeak. They are in Life's May-month hoursâ And those wild bursts of joy, what are they but Life's flowers? Would that thou could'st last for aye, Merry, ever-merry May! Made of sun-gleams, shade and showers, Bursting buds, and breathing flowers; Dripping-lock'd, and rosy-vested, Violet-slipper'd, rainbow-crested; Girdled with the eglantine, Festoon'd with the dewy vine: Merry, ever-merry May, Would that thou couldst last for aye! The Cardinal Bird. She brought a redbird in a cage And hung it from my window-sill:â The redbird then was all the rage, And may be still. I know notâI so long have been Amid the city's dust and din. But when I was a little child I greatly loved its wood-notes wild, Which lured me many a sunny day Through maple-forests far away. For years though I had seldom heard The cardinal bird. A day and then a week pass'd by:â The redbird hanging from the sill Sang not; and all were wondering why It was so stillâ When one bright morning, loud and clear, Its whistle smote my drowsy ear, Ten times repeated, till the sound Fill'd every echoing niche around; And all things earliest loved by me, âThe bird, the brook, the flower, the tree,â Came back again, as thus I heard The cardinal bird. Where maple orchards towered aloft, And spicewood bushes spread below, Where skies were blue, and winds were soft, I could but goâ For, opening through a wildering haze, Appeared my restless childhood's days; And truant feet and loitering mood Soon found me in the same old wood, â(Illusion's hour but seldom brings So much the very form of things)â Where first I sought, and saw, and heard The cardinal bird. Then came green meadows, broad and bright, Where dandelions, with wealth untold, Gleam'd on the young and eager sight Like stars of goldâ And on the very meadow's edge, Beneath the ragged blackberry hedge, 'Mid mosses golden, gray and green, The fresh young butter-cups were seen, And small spring-beauties, sent to be The heralds of Anemone: All just as when I earliest heard The cardinal bird. Upon the gray old forest's rim I snuff'd the crab-tree's sweet perfume; And farther, where the light was dim, I saw the bloom Of May-apples, beneath the tent Of umbrel leaves above them bent: Where oft was shifting light and shade The blue-eyed ivy wildly stray'd; And Solomon's-seal, in graceful play, Swung where the straggling sunlight lay:â The same as when I earliest heard The cardinal bird. And on the slope, above the rill That wound among the sugar-trees, I heard them at their labors still, The murmuring bees: Bold foragers! that come and go Without permit from friend or foe: In the tall tulip-trees o'er head On pollen greedily they fed; And from low purple phlox, that grew About my feet, sipp'd honey-dew. How like the scenes when first I heard The cardinal bird! How like!âand yet ... The spell grows weak:â Ah, but I miss the sunny browâ The sparkling eyeâthe ruddy cheek! Where, where are now The three who then beside me stood Like sunbeams in the dusky wood? Alas! I am alone. Since then, They 've trod the weary ways of men:â One on the eve of manhood died; Two in its flush of pow'r and pride. Their graves are green, where first we heard The cardinal bird. The redbird from the window hung, Not long my fancies thus beguiled: Again in maple-groves it sung Its wood-notes wild; For, rousing with a tearful eye, I gave it to the trees and sky.â I miss'd so much those brothers three, Who walk'd youth's flowery ways with me, I could not, dared not, but believe It too had brothers, that would grieve Till in old haunts again 't was heard, The cardinal bird. A Summer Scene. The day was well nigh o'er; The sun, near the horizon, dimly shone; And the long shadows of the door-yard trees, Athwart the yard were thrown. Before our humble door, Upon the soft, cool grass, With bosom open to the evening breeze Which now and then did pass, Musing, and dreaming of the spirit's birth, And its relations to this beautiful earth, I lay aloneâ Borne on Imagination's airy pinions, Far from the world's turmoil, and sordid man's dominions. Eve came on gently: and her step was seen Stirring the blossoms on the velvet green, And warning home the laden bee, Yet laboring busily. The while, her soft And delicate fingers pluck'd the leaves aloft, And whirl'd them round and round In eddies to the ground, Where I, an humble Pan, with many a wreath was crown'd! Presently on my ear, Rang full and deep, Joyous, and musical, and clear, A sound, which made my father-heart to leap, And sent the quick blood to my cheek and brow, Which with the recollection warm e'en now. It ceased, that thrilling tone: And with it passed my bright but dreamy train Of thoughtâand I was but a man again, Earthly, and weak, and lone. So slight a touch can jar the spirit's springsâ And e'en a word, or tone, or look, clip Fancy's wings. Once moreâOnce more, it rang upon my earâ But blent with other sounds, as clear And musical as it: A childish jestâand then a shout, From one, or two, or three, rang out, Full, free, and wildâ And then a fit Of childish laughter rent the dewy air! And now my eye a glimpse caught of the fair And lovely ONE: It was my own dear child! She and her little friends, hard at their play, Upon the grassy slope, that softly stretch'd away. Againâagainâ From the descending plain, Up rise those gleeful notes: but chief that voice Which first broke on my ear, And made my heart rejoice, Ascends, full, strong, and clearâ Approaching nigh and nigher, As the strain grows high and higher; Then, like a water-circle, flowing Away to every point, and growing Fainter, and fainter, till the last tones die, Lost, as far-journeying birds fade in the purple sky. Bonnets were in the air, And bonnet-ribbands scattered on the ground; Small shoes and pantalettes lay thick around, And tiny feet were bare: And frocks were soil'd, and aprons rent; But still they kept their frolic-mood, And laugh'd and romp'd; and when I went And closer by them stood, How hard each little elf did try To win the most of my regard; Now gazing anxious in my eye, And striving still more hard: The spirit, so it seem'd to me, The same in the great world we see, Spurring the warrior on to victory, And urging on the bard: Each had success as much at heart, As he who plays in war or politics his part. âMy child!âmy child!â She comes to me: Her cheeks are flush'd, her hair is wild, Her pulse is bounding free: With laugh and shout she comesâbut see! Half way she stops, as still as death; Her look is sadâshe hardly draws a breath. âMy child! my own dear child! Tell me, what aileth thee?â âFather!ââshe pointed to the moon, On the horizon's shatter'd boundâ 'T was rising, full and round. âFather! I'm coming soon.â Her other hand now pointed to the West, Where the dim sun was sinking to his rest. âFather! are those the eyes of God Looking upon us here?â Her knee bent slowly to the dewy sodâ And then came tear on tear: A gush of mingled feelingâwonder, and joy, and fear. The Mountain Paths. Come to the hills with me! Come tread the cool and flow'r-gem'd paths, that wind 'Neath many a stately treeâ Trees that for aye have lined The airy summits of our Western Land: The stars are fading, and the air is bland. Come to the hills with me! The fresh-lipp'd Morn is breathing glorious life: Don thy calash, and flee The city's dust and strife; Leave thy prunelle, and silken hose,âand take Cotton and calf-skin!âquick, thy toilet make! Hereâtake the garden's pride! Thy cheek, like it, will soon be rosy-fair. Now for the green hill side, And the pure upland air! Death floats in every breeze that fans us hereâ Oh, for the cottage of the mountaineer! Soâwe are winding up; The fair stars have not all yet left the sky: Thereâpluck that honey-cup! Thy slender hand will vie With it in whiteness; andâbut I forgetâ Dark eyes compare not with the violet: Still, pluck it too; I'll call Thine bright as any star, in any place. Nayâlet thy bonnet fall Back from thy radiant face! Heart's-ease, anemone, shrub, rose-of-May; âWhither thine eyes now? Ah! the King of Day! Gloriously comes he there! Morn on the hills! One hour of life like this, Pays for whole weeks of care; Earth scarce hath greater bliss: Yet âangel visitsâ are almost as many As visits to the hillsâThey turn no penny! What life is this I feel? A new sensation thrills through every vein: And glowing fancies steal Athwart my wondering brain: Visions of Eldâhopesâaspirationsâfears That vanish soonâbright dreams of coming years! 'Neath these old oaks and elms, The spirit hath a fullness of delightâ A depth of joy, that whelms, Like the lone, starry night, Our intellectual being, in a maze, Where fancy, pleas'd, bewilder'd, startled, playsâ Now floundering in gloom, Now reveling in glory, as a ray The darkness doth illume: Then bursts the perfect day, And the clear'd vision wanders wide and free Through the starr'd realms of vast Infinity. Morn on the hill-tops! Hark! The low of kine swells up from yon green vale, With song of meadow-lark, And merry note of quail; And the âhip-halloo!â of the wild cow-boy, Comes, soft and musical, and full of joy. The breeze is rising now: The purple clouds sail gracefully along; The spiral saplings bow, And swell the choral song; And from each tree-top, by the free wind stirr'd, Floats the rich matin of some grateful bird. Manâman alone! of all To whom this visible glory hath been given, Deemeth the privilege small Thus to commune with Heaven: There is no bank or railroad stock on highâ Stars are not goldâpence rain not from the sky! A Harvest Hymn. Great God!âour heart-felt thanks to Thee! We feel thy presence everywhere; And pray, that we may ever be Thus objects of thy guardian care. We sow'd!âby Thee our work was seen, And bless'd; and instantly went forth Thy mandate; and in living green Soon smiled the fair and fruitful earth. We toil'd!âand Thou didst note our toil; And gav'st the sunshine and the rain, Till ripen'd on the teeming soil The fragrant grass, and golden grain. And now, we reap!âand oh, our God! From this, the earth's unbounded floor, We send our Song of Thanks abroad, And pray Thee, bless our hoarded store! August. Dust on thy mantle! dust, Bright summer, on thy livery of green! A tarnish, as of rust, Dims thy late-brilliant sheen: And thy young gloriesâleaf, and bud, and flowerâ Change cometh over them with every hour. Thee hath the August sun Look'd on with hot, and fierce, and brassy face; And still and lazily run, Scarce whispering in their pace, The half-dried rivulets, that lately sent A shout of gladness up, as on they went. Flame-like, the long mid-day, With not so much of sweet air as hath stirr'd The down upon the spray, Where rests the panting bird, Dozing away the hot and tedious noon, With fitful twitter, sadly out of tune. Seeds in the sultry air, And gossamer web-work on the sleeping trees; E'en the tall pines, that rear Their plumes to catch the breeze, The slightest breeze from the unfreshening west, Partake the general languor and deep rest. Happy as man may be, Stretch'd on his back, in homely bean-vine bower, While the voluptuous bee Robs each surrounding flower, And prattling childhood clambers o'er his breast, The husbandman enjoys his noonday rest. Against the hazy sky, The thin and fleecy clouds unmoving rest: Beneath them far, yet high In the dim, distant west, The vulture, scenting thence its carrion-fare, Sails, slowly circling in the sunny air. Soberly, in the shade, Repose the patient cow, and toil-worn ox; Or in the shoal stream wade, Shelter'd by jutting rocks; The fleecy flock, fly-scourged and restless, rush Madly from fence to fence, from bush to bush. Tediously pass the hours, And vegetation wilts, with blister'd rootâ And droop the thirsting flowers, Where the slant sun-beams shoot; But of each tall old tree, the lengthening line, Slow-creeping eastward, marks the day's decline. Faster, along the plain, Moves now the shade, and on the meadow's edge: The kine are forth again, Birds flitter in the hedge. Now in the molten west sinks the hot sun: Welcome, mild eve!âthe sultry day is done. Pleasantly comest thou, Dew of the evening, to the crisp'd-up grass; And the curl'd corn-blades bow, As the light breezes pass, That their parch'd lips may feel thee, and expand, Thou sweet reviver of the fevered land. So, to the thirsting soul, Cometh the dew of the Almighty's love; And the scathed heart, made whole, Turneth in joy above, To where the spirit freely made expand, And rove, untrammel'd, in that âbetter land.â HappinessâA Picture. A green vale, and an humble cot Embowered in vines and spreading trees; Before the door a verdant plot, And flowers whose perfume loads the breeze: Upon the grass, those flowers among, Glad as the winds that thither stray, A group of children, fair and young,â Their cheeks are flush'd with play! Midway the two small rooms between, (For only two hath cot like this,) Spectator of the joyous scene, And sharer of the heart-felt bliss, A white-haired grandam;âon her knee Her knitting lies neglected now; She fairly strains her eyes to see,â Her specs pushed to her brow! A smile upon her withered cheeks,â On each a glistening tear-drop lies; Her lips apartâshe thoughtless speaks, And harder strains her filmy eyes. An anguish'd cry!âshe quickly sprung,â The sufferer's head was on her breast; A bee its tiny foot had stung, On clover-blossom prest. Autumn Afternoon. In the clouds my eye makes pictures, And paints them on the sky, And I photograph them on my mind As they go drifting by. In the air my ear finds music, And tracks it to the trees, And I score it on my heart before It leaves me with the breeze. On the earth my heart hears voices From the buried whom I love, And I lean to listen, but I find Them echoes from Above. On the seas my spirit trembles At the wierd, wild tones it hears, But it's only waves, I know, that sing The Anthem of the Years. From deep valleys, looking upward, All is calm that I descry, But I know the earth is fill'd with strife Beneath that quiet sky. On the mountains, gazing downward, Of my heav'nward height I'm vain, Yet I know the earth, seen from above, Is all one level plain. And it's always thus:âwherever I go, whatever do, Still the False is sure to come with strength, But stronger comes the True. And the False comes first in order, Its face all wreath'd with smiles, And thus tempts me with its hollowness, And woos me with its wiles. But I think me of the temple, And the pinnacle of oldâ Of the False that shrank with terror there, And the True that there were bold. And I think of the high mountain, And the wealth that lay in viewâ And the Devil there that still was false, And the Christ that still was True. And I think me of the Angels In the paths of Space that trod, And there minister'd, in light and love, To Him, the Son of God. And I think of all the Shadows That, like night, make dim my way, But pass off, or soon or late, and leave The certain light of day; And of all the blessÃ¨d angels That these shades have broken through, With their constant warnings of the False, And their whispers of the True. Then I send a voice to Heaven, With my thanks for every boon; And I worry notâbut still enjoy My Autumn Afternoon. To a Late Fall Flower. Rich, golden-hued, and fair! Beautiful gem 'mid the surrounding blight! Cheerfully wav'st thou there, A blessing to the sight: And lavishly dost thou thy sweets dispenseâ A balmy pleasure to the longing sense. When the fair buds of spring Have burst, and bloom'd, and faded from the eye, And the rich blossoming Of summer hath pass'd by, Thou com'st, 'mid chilling sleet, and winds that blight, Gladdening the gloomâa star in Sorrow's night. Thus, when youth's smooth, and fair, And rose-leaf tinted cheek hath pass'd away; And the rich, glossy hair, Is dim, and thin, and grey; And Time's fierce storms, and Age's wintry wind, Have scathed the body, and just spared the mind; Then, 'mid the general gloom, Bursts forth a light to guide the weary on, Joyfully, to the tomb, Where life's long march is done: Light of the soul! that from its heavenly height Dispels the darkness of the gathering night. The Wreck at Sea. The sun was lowâa flood of light Slept on the glittering oceanâ And Night's dark robes were journeying up, With slow and solemn motion: And ever-and-anon was heard The sea-mew's shriekâill-omened bird! Down sunk the sunâthe gathering mist Rose proudly up before it, And streamed upon the lurid air, A blood-red banner o'er it: Frowning, and piled up heap on heap, Dense clouds o'erspread the mighty Deep; Darker, and pitchy black they grewâ And rolled, and wheeled, and onward flew, Like marshaling of men. Then trembled timid souls with fearâ Glistened in beauty's eye the tearâ And âfatherlandâ was doubly dearâ But brave hearts quailed not then. Soon the rough tar's prophetic eye Saw many a floating shroud on high, And many a coffin drifting byâ And on the driving gale Beheld the spirits of the Deep, Aboveâaroundâin fury sweepâ Then he heard a low, sad wail, And at times a muttered curse, As on the fierce and troubled wind, Rode Deathâand, following close behind, A dark and sombre hearse. And soon the barque a wreck was driven, Before the free, wild winds of heaven! Now shrank with fear each gallant heartâ Bended was many a kneeâ And the last prayer was offered up God of the Deep, to Thee! Muttered the angry heavens still, And murmured still the seaâ And old and sterner hearts bowed down, God of the Deep, to Thee! And still the wreck was onward driven, Upon the wide, wild seaâ And Man's proud soul to Fate was given, Woman's, oh God, to Thee! Gaped wide the Deepâdown plunged the wreckâ Up rose a fearful yellâ Death's wings flapped o'er that sinking deckâ A shudder!âall was still. To My Mother. Thy cheekâit is pale my mother, And the light of thine eye is dimâ And the gushings of gladness, that used to fill Thy cup of joy to its brim, Come like the visits of angels, So âfew and far between,â That I feel the reed is a feeble one On which thou hence must lean. 'Tis a bitter thing, my mother, To look on a parent's decayâ To behold the Spoiler's ravages, As he tears life's bloom away: 'Tis bitter to look on the furrows He ploughs in the thoughtful browâ To weep o'er the gems of intellect That are rayless, and sheenless now. But there is a thought, my mother, That is balm to the stricken heart: âThough the gift of life is a frail one, And from it we soon must part, There is a haven of gladness, For the weary heart a home, Where the light of joy is never dim, And sorrows never come. On that blissful home, my mother, Thine eye is often bent, Like a tiny child's on a wished-for-thingâ So longingâso intent. Oh, how pure in the eye of Heaven Must the heart of the Christian beâ So entirely fixed on that home above, From earthliness so free! The Bridal. He stood before the altar; and a shade Of darkness for a moment crossed his brow. And melted into beauty on his lip; And a slight tremor thrilled him, as the blood Came boiling to his foreheadâand sunk back, And rushed tumultuous to his burning cheek. But this was overâand the confidence Of manhood was upon him; and he stood Erect, in pride and nobleness, before The minister of the High Godâa man Hoary and tremulous, and bowed with years. And she, the loved, the beautiful, stood up Beside the chosen one; and meekly bent Her half-closed eyes upon her swelling breast: And on her temples slept a raven tress, Shading her beautiful veins, that melted through, Like amethyst half-hidden in the snow. And loveliness hung round her, like a soft And silvery drapery. And pain, and sin, And sorrow's discipline, on her fair brow Had no abiding place. The various shades Of sorrow and of gladness, came and went With almost every pulse, like the uncertain And silent memory of forgotten dreams. They stood togetherâand their hearts were proud, His of its nobleness, and hers of him! The holy father offered up a prayer, That happiness in after time might be The guerdon of their loveâand that the star Which rose so beautiful and cloudless now, Might light their years of trial, and go down Calmly, as it aroseâand they were ONE. Here endeth this fair picture. Time wore on, And they commingled with the callous world, And had their day of glory and of gloom, And slept and were forgotten. Others came, And filled their places at the social hearth: They too have passed away. And ever thus Time silently goes on his ceaseless round, Unnoticed and unknown; and human kind Are but the puppets, moved about at will, And lain within the dreamless sepulcher, To wait the coming of that far-off day, When the enfranchised spirit shall awake, And burst the cerements of the humid grave, And live, and be immortal! Barley Bree. In Auld Scotia was thy home, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! But thou sawest fit to roam O'er the sea:â And thy roving feet have trod Wheresoe'er the smile of God Hath lent greenness to the sod Barley Bree. Thou hast been a jovial wight, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! Ever ready, day or night, With thy glee; And as time has sped along, 'Midst thy laugh, and joke, and song, Thou hast never dream'd of wrong, Barley Bree. Thy heart was ever warm, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! If sunshine or if storm Came to thee, And the poor who sought thy door, Though oft helped by thee before, Ever freely shared thy store, Barley Bree! Thou didst alway love thy drop, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! But the pint at which to stop, Thou did'st see. Yet the habit grew too strong, And thou lingeredst too long O'er the draught and o'er the song, Barley Bree! And as time flew round about, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! Thine own elbow soon peeped out, And thy knee; And thy face grew round and red, And thy jollity all fled, And the street was oft thy bed, Barley Bree! But an angel help'd thee up, Barley Bree! Barley Bree! And for aye the poison-cup Thou did'st flee; And again thou art erect, And with mirth thy brow is deck'd, And thou hast the world's respect, Barley Bree. The Revelers. There were sounds of mirth and revelry, In an old ancestral hall, And many a merry laugh rang out, And many a merry call; And the glass was freely pass'd around, And the red wine freely quaff'd; And many a heart beat high with glee, And the joy of the thrilling draughtâ In that broad and huge ancestral hall, Of the times that were, of old. A voice arose, as the lights grew dim, And a glass was flourished high: âI drink to Life!â said a Reveler bold, âAnd I do not fear to die. I have no fearâI have no fearâ Talk not of the vagrant, Death; For he's but a grim old gentleman, And wars but with his breath.â A boast well worthy a revel-rout Of the times that were, of old. âWe drink,â said all, âWe drink to Life And we do not fear to die!â Just then a rushing sound was heard, As of quick wings sweeping by; And soon the old latch was lifted up, And the door flew open wide, And a stranger strode within the hall, With an air of martial pride: In visor and cloak, like a secret knight Of the times that were, of old. He spoke: âI join in your revelry, Bold sons of the Bacchan rite, And I drink the toast ye have filled to drink, The pledge of yon dauntless knight: Fill highâfill higherâwe drink to Life, And we scorn the vagrant, Death, For he's but a grim old gentleman, And wars but with his breath.â A pledge well worthy a revel-rout Of the times that were, of old. âHe's a noble soul, that champion knight, And he wears a martial brow: Oh, he'll pass the gates of Paradise, To the regions of bliss below!â The Reveler stood in deep amazeâ Now flashed his fiery eye; He muttered a curseâthen shouted loud, âIntruder, thou shalt die!â And his sword leap'd out, like a baron's brave, Of the times that were, of old. He struckâand the stranger's guise fell off, When a phantom before him stood, A grinning, and ghastly, and horrible thing, That curdled his boiling blood. He stirred not again, till the stranger blew A blast of his withering breath; Then the Reveler fell at the Phantom's feet, And his conqueror wasâDeath! In that broad and high ancestral hall, Of the times that were, of old. The Invalid. She came in Spring, when leaves were green, And birds sang blithe in bower and tree, A stranger, but her gentle mien It was a calm delight to see. In every motion, grace was hers; On every feature, sweetness dwelt; Thoughts soon became her worshipersâ Affections soon before her knelt. She bloom'd through all the summer days As sweetly as the fairest flowers, And till October's softening haze Came with its still and dreamy hours. So calm the current of her life, So lovely and serene its flow, We hardly mark'd the deadly strife Disease forever kept below. But Autumn winds grew wild and chill, And pierced her with their icy breath; And when the snow on plain and hill Lay white, she passed, and slept in death. Tones only of immortal birth Our memory of her voice can stir; With things too beautiful for earth Alone do we remember her. She came in Spring, when leaves were green, And birds sang blithe in bower and tree, And flowers sprang up and bloomed between Low branches and the quickening lea. The greenness of the leaf is gone, The beauty of the flower is riven, The birds to other climes have flown, And there's an angel more in Heaven. A Wonderful Story. I. Last night, in the deep mid watches, As I sat alone in my room, A Form stood suddenly by me, That at first seem'd part of the gloom,â But anon, by the few, faint embers, Distinct all its outlines grew, And I saw that the gloom of my chamber, And the gloom of the Form, were two. II. Ere long the defined proportions Of a gray old man stood there, Looking out from his beard of silver, And his thin, white, flowing hair. His face, in its whole expression, Was beautiful and benign, As he leant his staff in the corner, And took a seat by mine. III. Then the gloom in my chamber vanish'd; And the light,âit so did seem,â Came out from his shadowy vestments, In many a flash and stream. And soon, through the thin, pale ashes, Appear'd a tortuous flame; And the characters which it pictured, Were the letters of a name. IV. And that name was simplyâWisdom: But why or whence it came, I learnt not from the ashesâ I learnt not from the flame. But the old man entertain'd me With a story that was new; And in its clear unwindings Perhaps may lie the clew:â VI. I know no more about it, Than what I hear unfold: Thus the Greybeard sought my chamberâ This the story that he told; But I've often thought, Isola, If the tales told you and me Were more of them like this one, How much better it would be. Thirty-Five. The keystone of the arch of Life, is now Beneath me. Thoughtfully I hence survey What is to be, and what has been, and bow My head in deep humility, and lay My pride in dust, that with my willing mind, And with my vigorous arm, and with my heart As strong, I've done so little for my kind, And less for God ... Here Life's two eras part: The past, MY past, I count but little worth: I've fell'd the forest, broken up the earth, And gathered here a seed, and there a root, Of flower, and grain, and berry-bearing shoot; But all was purposeâpreparationâplanâ The small beginnings of Life's little span. The FUTURE of my being is for toil:â To plant the gathered germs, and till the soil, And, without indolence or weak surcease, Watch the quick growth, and help the large increase; Then, as Life's circling seasons onward move, To heap the bounteous summer's golden grain, And autumn's fruitage, on the lumbering wain. Grant me, Thou Mighty One who sitt'st above, To sow the seeds of Truth, and reap the fruits of Love. FINIS.</field>
