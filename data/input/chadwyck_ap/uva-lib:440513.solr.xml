      <field name="fulltext">SCHOOL SONG BOOK. PART FIRST The Petition. O thou! who didst call Young children to thee; Hear our petition Though feeble it be.â Thy love and thy blessing We children would claim;â We come at thy summons, We sing in thy name;â O breathe in our hearts Sweet Peace from the skies, And joyful, dear Saviour, Our voices shall rise! Birds. If ever I see, On bush or tree, Young birds in a pretty nest, I must not, in my play, Steal the birds away, To grieve their mother's breast. My mother, I know, Would sorrow so, Should I be stolen away; So I'll speak to the birds, In my softest words, Nor hurt them in my play. And when they can fly, In the bright blue sky, They'll warble a song to me; And then, if I'm sad, It will make me glad To think they are happy and free. Where Shall We Go? Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? The glorious sun is rising fast, And morn's cool hours will soon be past. Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? In the morn the heart is lightest, In the morn the mind is brightest, Morning is the hour for studyâ Now to schoolâ'tis time already; There will we go, There will we go, There, oh there, there will we goâ We will go, we will go, we will goâ There will we go. Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? The scorching noon-tide heat is past, And fleecy clouds the sky o'ercast; Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? Down the vale and o'er the mountain, Through the grove, beside the fountain, Resting in the pleasant bowers, Culling all the bright-eyed flowersâ There will we go, There will we go, There, oh there, there will we goâ We will go, we will go, we will goâ There will we go. Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? The evening shadows lengthen fast, The sun's low, level rays are cast; Where shall we go, Where shall we go, Where, oh where, where shall we go? Home, to greet our gentle mother, Kindest father, sister, brother; All our sweetest flowers we'll give them,â Oh! how gladly they'll receive them. Home we will goâ Home we will goâ Home, home, home, home we will goâ We will go, we will go, we will goâ Home we will go. The Coral Branch. I thought my branch of coral A pretty shrub might be, Until I learned a little worm Had made it in the seaâ Down, down so deep, Where dark waters sleep, The coral insect lives; But rests not there, With toil and care, It upward, upward strives. It builds its coral palaces, Than lofty hills more high; And then, the structure to complete, The little worm must die,â Thus teaching me, When coral I see, That, dying, I should leave Some good work here, My friends to cheer, When o'er my tomb they grieve. The Stars. See, the stars are coming, In the far blue skies! Mother, look! they brightenâ Are they angels' eyes? No, my child, the lustre Of the stars is given, Like the hues of flowers, By the God of heaven. Mother, if I study, Sure He'll let me know Why the stars He kindled, O'er our earth to glow?â Child, what God has finished Has a glorious aim: Thine it is to worship, Thine to love His name. Wild Flowers. Flowers, wild-wood flowersâ In a sheltered dell they grew: I hurried along, and chanced to spy This small star-flower, with its silver eye; Then this blue daisy peeped up its head, Sweetly this purple orchis spread,â I gathered them all for you; All these wild-wood flowers, Sweet wild-wood flowers. Flowers, lovely flowersâ In the garden we may see; The rose is there, with her ruby lip, Pinks, the honey-bee loves to sip, Tulips, gay as a butterfly's wing, Marygolds, rich as the crown of a king; But none so fair to me, As these wild-wood flowers, Sweet wild-wood flowers. Flowers, wild-wood flowersâ Do they not tell of heaven O, man may garnish his garden bowers, But who hath tended these wild-wood flowers? Is it not He who rules above, Sending these tokens of his love âGod's own hand hath given These sweet wild-wood flowers, Sweet wild-wood flowers. No Home. (âChildren's Song.â) âNo homeâno homeââI heard him sigh, The tears were trembling in his eye, And then he would not join our play, âI'm sure he never can be gay. No homeâno homeâwhere will he go? His voice was sad, his step was slowâ O, whither, whither, should I flee, If there was not a home for me! My homeâmy homeâhow brightly come The thoughts that whisper of my home; âIts pleasant rooms, its flowers and booksâ And then my mother's loving looks! Dear homeâdear homeâne'er let me be Compelled to wander far from thee, Like yon poor orphan boy to roam, And sighing sayââNo homeâno home!â Winter Pleasures. (âIf ever I see.â) I never will say, âHow cold to-day!ââ And shiver, and shake, and moan;â The winter has joys For us, little boys, We'll sing in a joyous tone. There's the quiet slide, And the glad sleigh-ride, When the bells are gingling free, And the merry snow-ball, And better, than all, The coasting trade for me. But I would not play Through the cold bleak day; And how happy it is to go To the warm school-room, Or my dear, dear homeâ Away from the cold and snow. So I never will say, âHow cold to-day!ââ And shiver, and shake, and moanâ The winter has joys For us little boys, We'll sing in a joyous tone. Welcome The Stranger. (âGather yon rose-buds, &amp;c.â) Welcome, young stranger, welcome here,â We call you friend already; All our gay pastimes you shall share, And share our cheerful study.â Never can youth true pleasure find In idle sports alone, But here the body and the mind Their proper worth are shown. Welcome, then, kindly welcome here, âOur hearts are in the chorus; O, we rejoice that you will share The pleasant days before us.â Sweeter our morning songs will blend, Another voice with ours, And faithfully our Teacher 'll tend The bud among the flowers. Welcome, young stranger, welcome here,â We call you friend already All our gay pastimes you shall share, And share our pleasant study. Banish, we pray you, banish fear; Here's none but friends around: Love's brightest flowers we cherish here, And not a thorn to wound. Welcome, then kindly, welcome here, Our hearts are in the chorus, O, we rejoice that you will share The happy days before us. Parting Strain. A bird and a rose-budâ These were my first treasuresâ And well I remember They told me life's pleasures Were fading and fleeting, Oft gone with the greeting.â I did not believe themâ Alas! the next day My sweet rose lay withered, My bird flew away! Away, away;â My sweet rose lay withered, My bird flew away. 'Tis thus with young friendships,â The dearer we cherish Our pleasant companions, The sooner they vanish; Like birds in the wild-wood,â But the true heart of child-hood Will never forget themâ And oft we shall say, O, why did they leave us, And go far away? Away, awayâ O, why did they leave us, And go far away? Hence learn we the lesson, That joy is unstable, Our life a vain shadow The world but a fable; That partings and crosses, And sorrows and losses Will ever attend us, On earth while we stay; And we, like our pleasures, Are passing away, Away, awayâ And we, like our pleasures, Are passing away. Tribute to our Teacher. Beneath thick shrubs, Where dark leaves spread, A budded flower Once raised its headâ Not a gleam of sunshine, Not a drop of dew, To make the buds bloom, Could find its way through. But a gardener came Where the pale buds lay, And he plucked the shrubs And dark leaves away; Then the bright flower breathed Its sweets on the air, As though it would thank The kind gardener's care. The young mind thus, In the world's cold shade, Dark errors round, Would pine and fade;â But the Teacher comes And the gloom is riven, And our hearts expand In the light of heaven. A monitor The flower shall beâ My own dark mind In the bud I seeâ My Teacher's care In its opening bloomâ And my gratitude In its sweet perfume. PART SECOND. All are Here. (Monday morning.) Cheerily, cheerily sound the strainâ Happily, happily met again, Here we standâ Who at home has dared to stay? Who has loitered by the way? And who for idle play Do we miss from our band? Merrily, merrily sound the strain, Happily, happily met again, All are here; All who love the morning's prime, All who feel the worth of timeâ So we'll sound the merry chime, All are here! all are here! Be Constant in Duty. (Tuesday morn.) The sun goeth down, But we feel no sorrow; We know he will rise As brightly to-morrowâ Why thus can we rest, When in darkness he leaves us, And trust to his coming? âHe never deceives usâ Never, no, never. A lesson we read, In brightness and beauty, By God's finger written, âBe constant in dutyââ And, graved on my heart, This lesson, to guide me, Shall ne'er be forgotten, Whatever betide me. Never, no, never. The Lost Day. (Wednesday morn.) âI've lost a day,â the monarch cried, And bowed his head in sorrowâ He never dreamed, amid his pride, He could command the morrow; Yet idle youth, in heedless haste To grasp some joy untasted, Will see a day has passed away, Nor mourn the moments wasted. Lost health by care we may restore, Lost wealth by toil obtain it; But time once lost returns no more, Nor power nor wealth can gain itâ âThe time we use, we never lose, Its worth is sealed in heaven; O, when this day has passed away How will my share be given! Always Happy. (Thursday morn.) âAlways happyââcan we say This will be a happy day, Now but begun? Dangers may our path surround, Sickness seize, and sorrows wound, Ere set of sun! Dangers, sorrows, sickness, all That the human race befal, Need not alarm; Blessings spring from grief's dark hours, As sweet incense from the flowers, Bowed by the storm. Be our feelings calm and kind, Hearts to duty's task inclined, Thoughts free from ill; Then in hope's glad tones we'll say, âThis will be a happy dayâ Surely it will!â The Present. (Friday morn.) For me, there's no time like the present, âThe past is too dreamy and old; Hope's light on the future, tho' pleasant, Like moonshine is cheating and cold. The present, 'tis ours by life's charter,â The terms areââimprove it for good;â And a bird in the hand who would barter For two flying wild in the wood? Each day is a treasure, that Heaven Bestows to awaken our love; And the favors thus constantly given, As constantly we must improve. Then let us value the presentâ The past is too dreamy and old; Hope's light on the future, tho' pleasant, Like moonshine is cheating and cold. Count the Time. (Saturday morn.) Why should we count our life by years, Since years are short, and pass away?â Or why by fortune's smiles and tears, Since tears are vain, and smiles decay? Then count by virtues, these will last When life's lame-footed race is o'er, And these, when earthly joys are past, May cheer us on a brighter shore. Another day, another day, Shall this be counted in my span, And virtue's sacred seal display Upon the page that writes me man? Good Night. Good nightâGood nightâand peace be with youâ Peace, that gentlest parting strain; Soft it falls like dew on blossoms, Cherishing within our bosoms, Kind desires to meet again: Good nightâGood night. Good nightâGood nightâbut not forever, Hope can see the morning rise, Many a pleasant scene before us, As though angels hovered o'er us, Bearing blessings from the skies: Good nightâGood night. Good nightâGood nightâoh, softly breathe it! 'Tis a prayer for those we love; Peace to-night and joy to-morrow, For our God, who shields the sparrow, Hears us in his courts above: Good nightâGood night. Going to Sea. Hark! hark!â'tis the signal!â The breezes are steady, The anchor is weighing, And we must be ready.â Farewell, my dear mother, I fear thou'lt be lonely, But, oh! do not sorrowâ I'll think of thee only. And dread not the danger Tho' I'm on the billow; I know my kind Saviour Will watch o'er my pillow: The sea own'd his sceptreâ When its path he was treading, The winds and the waters Grew calm at his bidding. We'll trust him, we'll trust him, We'll pray, and he'll hear us; On land or on water Alike he'll be near us: Be this song unto him Our heart's fond devotion, And under his guidance I'll launch on the ocean. The Little Cloud. See 1st Kings. Chap. 18 ver. 41 to 46. Two voices. (First voice.) âLook! look! towards the sea, And the tidings bring to me. (Second voice.) âNothing, nothing meets the eye, Save parched earth and burning sky. (First voice.) âLook! look! with humble prayer; Look seven times, and ne'er despair. (Second voice.) Ah! a little cloud I spy, Like a white hand on the sky. Haste! haste! for life awayâ Tell the king there's no delay; Say that little cloud contains Promise of abundant rains. God has pledged itâand 'tis done.â See, thick clouds are rolling on; Spreading, spreading black as nightâ Earth and heaven are shut from sight. But the storm, tho' wild above, Is to man the voice of love, Bidding famished nature live, And his hopes with her revive. They, who trust the King of kings, Find each storm a blessing brings.â Look! look, with humble prayer,â Look to heaven, and ne'er despair. The Thunder Storm. See! the black cloud rises highâ Now it spreads along the skyâ Look! the quivering lightnings flyâ Hark! the thunders roarâ Yet I will not shrink with fear When the thunder crash I hear: Soon the rainbow will appear, And the storm be o'er. In the summer's sultry day, When hot winds around us play, We should sink, the fever's prey, And revive no more: But the dark clouds fill the skies, And the vivid lightning flies; Then the cooling winds arise, And our danger 's o'er. He who rules the Summer hour, Cherishing the little flower, He directs the lightning's power, And the thunder's roar. Then I will not feel alarmâ He can shield me from all harm; In the sunshine or the storm God I will adore. The Rainbow. O, beautiful rainbow, All woven of light! There's not, in thy tissue, One shadow of night.â It seems as heaven opened, When thou dost appear, And a visible presence Of angels drew near, And sung the rainbow, The rainbow, The smile of God is here. I think, as I'm gazing, Thy colors to mark, How o'er the Ione mountain Where rested the ark, Those saved from the deluge, With wondering eye, Beheld the first rainbow Burst over the sky; And sung the rainbow, The rainbow, Thy promise, God, on high! And thousands of ages Have flourished and fled, Since on the first rainbow That promise was read.â Man dies, and earth changes, But still doth endure God's signet of mercy, Fresh, lovely, and pure, Then sing the rainbow, The rainbow, The love of God is sure. The Gifts of Spring. Spring! 'tis the spell of gladnessâ âWe breathe that Eden word, And in the youthful bosom What pleasant thoughts are stirred! Sweet thoughts of gushing fountains, Bright skies and blossomed trees, And soft green grass and violets, And wild bird's melodies. These visions warm the fancy, And wake the lyre of mirth; But Spring has gifts more precious To bless the waiting earth.â There's health upon her breezes, The glow of life they bear; And look upon the blossomed trees, You'll find hope's treasure there. O, tell us not of glory, And tell us not of wealth; Hope is the fame of youthful hearts, Their precious riches health.â We'll search the book of Nature, And learn where these are found, While Spring her gifts of buds and flowers Is scattering all around. The Garland. (âPleasures of Innocence.â) Summer freely waves her garlands roundâ Who would sigh for golden treasures? Who would seek to purchase pleasures? Summer freely waves her garlands round. Pleasure ever must be won by toilâ 'Tis the contrast of employment Gives to idleness enjoymentâ Pleasure ever must be won by toil. Who has earned a happy holiday? Has improvement marked thy hours? Then enjoy the summer flowersâ Thou hast earned a happy holiday. Summer freely waves her garlands roundâ Who will sigh for golden treasures? Who will seek to purchase pleasures? Summer freely waves her garland round. The Harvest Time. (âThe sun parts faintly, &amp;c.â) Calm Autumn crowned with ripened grain, And fruits of richest flavors,â With notes of joy we hail again The season of thy favors.â Our hearts and voices strike the chime, âThe harvest timeâthe harvest time! The harvest sun how bright at noon, His richest radiance throwing! And O, how bright the harvest moon, As she with joy were glowing, And fain with us would strike the chime, The harvest timeâthe harvest time! In our broad land we've every clime, All boast some gift possessing, And all enjoy the harvest time, That crowns each gift a blessingâ Then let our hearts and voices raise To God the praiseâto God the praise! Farewell to the Year. Farewell, thy destiny is done, Thy ebbing sands we tell, Blended and set with all that's goneâ Thou dying year, farewell! Gifts from thy handâSpring's joyous leaves, And Summer's breathing flowers, Autumn's bright fruit and bursting sheaves,â These blessings have been ours: They pass with thee, and now they seem Like gifts from fairy spell, Or like some sweet remembered dream; We bid those gifts farewell! Tho' frail the fair, rich things of earth, Must mind's bright hopes be frail? And those pure thoughts that owed their birth To theeâthus with thee fail? Not if the soul but gird her might, Her treasures guard with care.â The storm-swelled stream, that sweeps the height, But lays the rich mine bare. The high resolve, the holy fear, Waked by thy passing knell, O, take not these, thou dying year! We bid not these farewell. One is Gone. Gone, gone from our number, We miss one dear faceâ One voice has departedâ There's one vacant place.â Gone, gone, and forever; There is no returnâ The absent we pray forâ The dead we must mourn; And gathering in sadness To-day we appear, Each note of our music The tone seems to bear.â âOne is gone!â The beam of the morning, The bud of the Spring, The promise of beauty And brightness may bring; But clouds gather darkness, And, touched by the frost, The pride of the plant and The morning are lost.â The bright and the lovely Thus ever decay; The young and the cherished Are passing away;â One is gone. Gone, goneâand O, whither? The bird on the wing, Whose food is the flowers, Must follow the spring; And thus our companion, In life's flowery time, Has passed to the Saviour, In that blessed clime, Where youth blooms eternal, And never is heard, Its pure joys to sadden, The earth-laden word, âOne is gone. Independence. We come with hearts of gladness, To breathe our songs of praise;â Let not a note of sadness Be blended in the lays; For 'tis a hallowed story, The theme of Freedom's birth; Our father's deeds of glory Are echoed round the earth. The sound is waxing stronger, And thrones and nations hear; âMan may not triumph longer, For God, the Lord is nearââ And He will crush oppression, And raise the humble mind, And give the earth's possession Among the good and kind. And then shall sink the mountains, Where pride and power were crowned; And peace, like gentle fountains, Shall shed its pureness round.â And then the world will hear us, And join our glorious lay, And songs of millions cheer us, On this our Nation's Day. Soon Freedom's loud hosannas Shall burst from every voice, Till mountains and savannas Roll back the soundââRejoice!â To God, the king of heaven, Then consecrate the strain;â Earth's fetters will be riven, And God the Lord will reign. My Native Land. My native land, my native landâ O 'tis a lovely land to me; I bless my God that I was born Where man is free. Our landâit is a glorious landâ And wide it spreads from sea to seaâ And sister states in Union join, And all are free. All but two millions. And equal laws we all obey; To kings we never bend the knee:â We may not own no Lord but God, Where all are free. We've lofty hills and sunny vales, And streams that roll to either sea, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.â And through this large and varied land Alike we're free. You hear the sounds of healthful toil, And youth's gay shout and childhood's glee, And every one in safety dwells, And all are free. We 're brothers all, from South to North; One bond will draw us to agreeâ We love this country of our birthâ We love the free. We love the name of Washington, I lisped it on my father's knee; âAnd we shall ne'er forget the name While we are free. My land, my own dear native land, Thou art a lovely land to me; I bless my God that I was born Where man is free. Closing the School. TWO VOICES. First voice. Like the rivers ceaseless flow, Days, and hours, and moments go; And the year, that endless seems In the future's busy schemes, Passesâit is pastâthe yearâ What hath been its record here? Second voice. Not by labors we have wrought Can we show the growth of thought; As the plant you tend for years, Ere its ripened fruit appears, Thus the youthful mind must be Nurtured long ere fruit you see. First voice. Parting is a tearful word, Breathed in grief, in sorrow heardâ Here its cadence draws no sigh, Its expression dims no eyeâ When the closing song is o'er, Do we part to meet no more? Second voice. Again, again, we meet againâ Deem not this a farewell strainâ 'Tis the joy of change we hail, When its fleeting pleasures fail, Like tired birds that fold the wing, Blithely here our songs we'll sing. The Resting-Place. There's many a path At life's opening raceâ But all will meet At one Resting-Place. Will ours be the path Where rose-leaves spread; Or shall we be doomed, The thorns to tread? Be this on each mind A guiding truth, To check the vain hope, And the pride of youth. Though afar and apart We may urge our race, We all shall meet At one Resting-Place. Our Father in Heaven. Our Father in heaven, We hallow thy name, May thy kingdom, holy, On earth be the sameâ O, give to us, daily, Our portion of bread! It is from thy bounty That all must be fed. Forgive our transgressions, And teach us to know That humble compassion Which pardons each foeâ Keep us from temptation, From weakness and sinâ And thine shall be glory Foreverâamen! The Book. Written in the blank leaf of a Bible. The bookâthy mother sends it boy,â And let its truths thy mind employ: Dost askââamid the world of men, When shall I read?ââI'll tell thee when To read the Book. When the glad morning's early voice Rouses the slumberer to rejoice, And thoughts are thronging free and bright, Till thy heart feels that âGod is lightââ Then read the Book. When night steals on, with steps of fear, Look upâthe shining stars appear: Thus ever glorious they endure, They 'll teach thy heart that âGod is pure;â Then read the Book. When health in all thy pulses plays, And life seems formed of joyous days, And all around, earth, sky and flood, Are witnessing that âGod is good,ââ Then read the Book. When sickness comes, with wasting power, And bows thy head, like drooping flower, 'Mid the sharp pains thou dost endure, Remember, âHe who wounds can cureââ And read the Book. This life has blessings, nor in vain Are these displayed for us to gain: If thou dost win them, son, then raise Thy thanks to Him who guides our ways, And read the Book. But griefs wait all of woman born: Should'st thou be friendless and forlorn, And life a weary pathway prove, Still trust in Heavenââfor God is love,ââ And read the Book. There comes an hour that all must share, When vain a mother's love and care, The hour of deathâbut through the strife, Repose on Him whose words of life Are in the Book. The Silk Worm. There is no form upon our earth That bears the mighty Maker's seal, But has some charm:âto draw this forth, We must have hearts to feel. I saw a fair young girlâher face Was sweet as dream of cherished friendâ Just at the age when childhood's grace And maiden softness blend. A silk-worm in her hand she laid, Nor fear, nor yet disgust was stirred; But gaily with her charge she played, As 't were a nestling bird. She raised it to her dimpled cheek, And let it rest and revel thereâ O, why for outward beauty seekâ Love makes its favorites fair. That wormâI should have shrunk, in truth, To feel the reptile o'er me move; But, loved by innocence and youth, I deemed it worthy love. Would we, I thought, the soul imbue, In early life, with sympathies, For every harmless thing, and view Such creatures formed to please: And when with usefulness combined, Give them our love and gentle careâ O, we might have a world as kind As God has made it fair! There is no form upon our earth, Bearing the mighty Maker's seal, But has some charm:âto call this forth We need but hearts to feel.</field>
