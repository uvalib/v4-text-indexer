      <field name="fulltext">I speak, as in the days of youth, In simple words some earnest truth. TO SIBELLA FLOWER. There is a form more light and fair, Than human tongue can tell, It seems a spirit of the air. She is a flower si belle! The lovely cheek more faintly flushed Than ocean's rosy shell, Is like a new-found pearl that blushed, She is a flower si belle! Her glossy hair in simple braid, With softly curving swell, Might well have crowned a Grecian maid. She is a flower si belle! Her serious and dove-like eyes Of gentle thoughts do tell; Serene as summer ev'ning skies. She is a flower si belle! Her graceful mouth was outlined free By Cupid's magic spell, A bow for his sure archery. She is a flower si belle! And thence soft silv'ry tones do flow, Like rills along the dell, Making sweet music as they go. She is a flower si belle! Fairer still is the modest mind, Pure as a crystal well, In mountain solitude enshrined. She is a flower si belle! A SERENADE. Sleep well! Sleep well! To music's spell; Thus hushing thee To reverie, Like ev'ning breeze, Through whisp'ring trees; Till mem'ry and the lay Float dreamily away. Sleep well! Sleep well! May dreams bring near All who are dear, With festal flow'rs From early hours; While, softly free, This melody Drifts through thy tranquil dream, Like lilies on a stream. Sleep well! Sleep well! SUPPLICATION TO SPRING. Oh, save me, save me, gentle Spring! Bring healing on thy balmy wing! I loved thee more than all the year. To no one hast thou been more dear. Bright emeralds I valued less, Than early grass, and water-cress. Gem of the year I named thy flower, Though roses grace fair Summer's bower. The queenly ones, with fragrant sighs, Tried to allure thy poet's eyes; But they were far less dear to me, Than thy simple wild anemone. Bear witness for me, little flower! Beloved from childhood's earliest hour; And dandelions, so much despised, Whose blossoms more than gold I prized. I welcomed swallows on the wing, And loved them for their news of Spring. I gave a feast for the earliest one, As if a long-lost child had come, Blest harbingers of genial hours, Unite your voices with the flowers! Dear graceful birds, pour forth your prayer, That nature will her poet spare! Plead with the Maker of the rain! That he will chilling showers restrain; And my poor breast no longer feel Sharp needle-points of frosty steel. Thou beautiful old maple tree! For my love's sake, pray thou for me! Thy leaf-buds, op'ning to the sun, Like pearls I counted ev'ry one. I wished I might thy grandson be, Dear, ven'rable old maple tree! That my young arms might round thee twine, And mix my vernal crown with thine. Ah, even now, full well I ween, Thou hast thy robe of soft light-green. I seem to hear thee whisp'ring slow To the vernal grass below. Stretch thy strong arms toward the sky, And pray thy poet may not die! I will heal thy scars with kisses sweet, And pour out wine upon thy feet. Blessings on the patriarch tree! Hoarsely he intercedes for me; And little flowers, with voices mild, Beg thee to spare thy suff'ring child. Fair season, so beloved by me! Thy young and old all plead with thee. Oh, heal me, with thy balmy wing! I have so worshipped thee, sweet Spring TO THE GULDENLAK. Sweet flower! before thy reign is o'er, I shall be gone, to return no more, Before thou losest thy crown of gold, I shall lie low in the cold dark mould. Open the window, and raise me up! My last glance must rest on her golden cup. My soul will kiss her, as it passes by And wave farewell from the distant sky. Yea, twice will I kiss thy fragrant lip, Where the wild honey-bee loves to sip. The first, I will give for thy own dear sake; The second, thou must to my rose-bush take. I shall sleep sound in the silent tomb, Before the beautiful bush will bloom; But ask her the first fair rose to lay On her lover's grave, to fade away. Give her the kiss I gave thee to keep, And bid her come on my breast to sleep; And, glowing flower, with sweetest breath, Be thou our bridal torch in death! TO THE TRAILING ARBUTUS. Thou delicate and fragrant thing! Sweet prophet of the coming Spring! To what can poetry compare Thy hidden beauty, fresh and fair? Only they who search can find Thy trailing garlands close enshrined; Unveiling, like a lovely face, Surprising them with artless grace. Thou seemest like some sleeping babe, Upon a leafy pillow laid; Dreaming, in thy unconscious rest, Of nest'ling on a mother's breast. Or like a maiden in life's May, Fresh dawning of her girlish day; When the pure tint her cheeks disclose Seems a reflection of the rose. More coy than hidden love thou art, With blushing hopes about its heart; And thy faint breath of fragrance seems Like kisses stolen in our dreams. Thou'rt like a gentle poet's thought, By Nature's simplest lessons taught, Reclining on old moss-grown trees, Communing with the whisp'ring breeze. Like timid natures, that conceal What others carelessly reveal; Reserving for a chosen few Their wealth of feeling, pure and true. Like loving hearts, that ne'er grow old, Through autumn's change, or winter's cold; Preserving some sweet flowers, that lie 'Neath withered leaves of years gone by. At sight of thee a troop upsprings Of simple, pure, and lovely things; But half thou sayest to my heart, I find no language to impart. A SONG. Hush! hush! Love lies at rest, Like a bird in her nest, Like dew in a lily's breast, Love is sleeping. Roses breathe fragrant sighs Over his drowsy eyes, But, ah, how still he lies! Love is sleeping. Drive the honey-bees away! Let not the sun's bright ray Over his features play! Love is sleeping. Lest his slumbers should fly, Gentle Music draw nigh, With your sweet lullaby! Keep him sleeping! Ha! his cheek grows warm Under the magic charm, And he moves his white arm! Love is dreaming, His little limbs shiver, His soft eye-lids quiver, Like rays on a river: Love is waking. THE STREAM OF LIFE In morning hours, Full of flowers, Our swift boats glide O'er life's bright tide; And every time the oars we raise The falling drops like diamonds blaze. From earth and sky Comes melody; And ev'ry voice Singeth, âRejoice!â While echoes all around prolong The cadence of that wondrous song. Above each boat Bright fairies float, Mounting on air To castles there. The earth is full of glorious things All tinged with light from rainbow wings. Dear Friendship's smile, And Love's sweet wile, Make Life all bright With genial light, And seem to shine with steady ray, That ne'er can change, or fade away. More slowly glides life's evening boat, And withered flowers around it float. The drops fall dark from weary oars, And dismal fogs shroud all the shores. Like widowed bird that mourns alone, Sings Music, in her minor tone, Of flowers that blossom but to die; And echoes answer plaintively. Bright fairies change to limping hags; Their rainbow wings to dingy rags. Dark heavy clouds sail through the air, Where golden castles shone so fair. Strong hearts grow faint, and young ones old; Friendships decline, and Love is cold. Dim twilight changes morn's ideal To flick'ring shadows, all unreal. But joy remains, if we have thrown Fresh flowers to boats around our own. Though currents part us far and wide, Sweet perfumes live from flowers that died. Or if our blossoms formed good seeds, Such as the growing future needs, Those little germs perchance may yield Rich waving crops in Time's ripe fields. Though dark the tide we're drifting o'er, It brings us near that brighter shore, Where longing souls at length will know The use of this world's changing show. Meanwhile, though sunlight has gone down, Life's ev'ning wears a starry crown, Where weary ones, who look above, May read the letters, âGod is love.â THE WORLD THAT I AM PASSING THROUGH. Few, in the days of early youth, Trusted like me in love and truth. I've learned sad lessons from the years; But slowly, and with many tears; For God made me to kindly view The world that I was passing through. How little did I once believe That friendly tones could e'er deceive! That kindness, and forbearance long, Might meet ingratitude and wrong! I could not help but kindly view The world that I was passing through. And though I've learned some souls are base, I would not, therefore, hate the race; I still would bless my fellow men, And trust them, though deceived again. God help me still to kindly view The world that I am passing through! Through weary conflicts I have passed, And struggled into rest at last; Such rest as comes when the rack has broke A joint, or nerve, at ev'ry stroke. But the wish survives to kindly view The world that I am passing through. From all that fate has brought to me I strive to learn humility; And trust in Him who rules above, Whose universal law is love. Thus only can I kindly view The world that I am passing through. When I approach the setting sun, And feel my journey nearly done, May earth be veiled in genial light, And her last smile to me seem bright! Help me, till then, to kindly view The world that I am passing through! And all who tempt a trusting heart From faith and hope to drift apart, May they themselves be spared the pain Of losing power to trust again! God help us all to kindly view The world that we are passing through! TO THE NASTURTIUM; WHICH LINNÃUS DESCRIBES AS EMITTING PHOSPHORESENCE IN THE DARK. Glorious flower! so gorgeously bright! As if thou wert formed of orient light! In topaz, and gold, and velvet array, Like an Eastern Queen on her bridal day! Rich jewels the Sun to the Earth dropped down, And the Earth gave him back thy floral crown. Thy tints, glowing warm as a summer noon, Seem painted tones from some amorous tune; And surely thy varying flushes came From Italian music's radiant flame; Or, when Apollo touched his golden lyre, Earth answered the sounds with thy brilliant fire. Thy ardent blossoms were at first unfurled, A love-letter written to all the world; And not by day only, but even by night, The writing shines through with phosphoric light. That letter of love the Tropies sent forth, Sealed full of sunshine, a gift to the North. Bright Summer is proud thy garland to wear; It shines like rich gems in Autumn's pale hair; And it warms our homes with a sunny glow, When earth has assumed her mantle of snow. Wealth of bright beauty hast thou for thy dower, Resplendent, warm-hearted, tropical flower! I WANT TO GO HOME. There once wandered with me a beautiful child, With eyes like the antelope, lambent and mild; And she looked at me long, with an earnest gaze, As I watched the sun sink in a golden haze. She knew not the thoughts that were floating away, Through the closing gates of that radiant day; But a something she read in my dreaming eyes, Of the pale autumn leaves, and the sunset skies; And a chill came over her, she knew not whenceâ 'Twas the shadow of older experience. She looked up afraid at the heaven's blue dome, And murmured, âI'm tired. I want to go home.â The child's timid glance, and her quivering tone, Came gliding like ghosts, when my soul was alone; And oft, when I gazed at the heaven's blue dome, She seemed to be saying, âI want to go home.â She grew up a woman, that lovely young child, With eyes like the antelope, lambent and mild; But she lived not to see life's drear autumn day Fade slowly in silence and darkness away. In her spring-time of freshness, fragrance, and bloom, Disease stole her roses to strew on the tomb. Then often she looked at the heaven's blue dome, And sighed, âI am tired. I want to go home.â My autumn of life is fast passing away, Bringing on the long night, and cold winter day; And I often remember her childish sigh, As she turned from my face to the twilight sky. When I sit on her grave, at sunset, alone, Her voice seems to speak in that tremulous tone; And longing I look up to heaven's blue dome, Saying, âFather! I'm tired. I want to go home.â</field>
