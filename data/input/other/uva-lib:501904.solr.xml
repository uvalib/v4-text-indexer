      <field name="heading_text">IN SEARCH OF NATIVE AZALEAS HENRY T. SKINNER 1</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The following notes are set down as an abbreviated record of a rather extensive collecting trip in search of native azaleas. Besides telling something of the journey and the plants encountered the following pages will also include information concerning the plant specimens collected on this trip so that a record will be available to others who may chance to study these specimens at a later date or who may wonder in what woods, on what mountaintop or along what stream a special azalea grows. But first an explanation. Our native azaleas or ”Bush Honeysuckles“ were a source of admiration, frequently recorded, to the first European travellers on this continent. Several species found their way to Europe at an early date, were known to Linnaeus and were used in hybridization with the European Pontic Azalea * ( Rhododendron flavum ) and Oriental Rhododendron molle to produce the many-colored and very hardy Ghent hybrids which have graced our gardens for many years. But while a few species such as the Pinxterbloom ( R. nudiflorum ), Flame Azalea ( R. calendulaceum ) and Sweet Azalea ( R. arborescens ) have been cultivated to some extent in this country it seems strange indeed that until very recently no real attempts have been made either to select the better wildlings for garden cultivation or to use them as parental breeding stocks for the production of finer hybrids than the old Ghents. There are excellent potentials for a new race which might well offer strong competition to the “Japanese” azaleas with which our gardens are now filled. These native azaleas have a color range from white to pink, red and yellow, they may be dwarf or very tall, single stemmed or more stoloniferous than a raspberry bush— and certain of them root readily from cuttings. What other characters could be desired? Perhaps evergreen leaves, but this is not impossible to the breeder. It was a realization of these facts, plus an awareness of the marked limitations of our present knowledge of the botany, genetics or even geographic distribution of the native species which led to the planning of a research project at the Morris Arboretum calculated to provide more accurate information about our native azaleas, their natures, their natural occurrences and their behaviour. A project with these objectives called for a study of the literature on azaleas, a detailed examination of herbarium materials assembled at various institutions and extensive study and collection in the field to determine more accurately the nature and distribution of the individuals comprising the taxonomic units as we now know them. The collection of many specimens at the same location provides data on variability which the single existing herbarium specimen cannot give, and this kind of information was essential for constructing a picture which may still require many years of examination and analysis to develop in its full clarity. The project was initiated in 1950 in cooperation with the Department of Botany of the University of Pennsylvania and the Academy of Natural Sciences and was greatly advanced by a grant from the American Philosophical Society which made possible the field collecting trip of present concern and as undertaken by the writer during a leave of absence from regular duties at the Morris Arboretum. While this writer is indebted to many persons for assistance at all stages of this native azalea project, he is especially appreciative of the continuous guiding interest of Dr. W. H. Camp who was so largely responsible for the initiation of this venture, and to Dr. J. R. Schramm who, as Director of the Morris Arboretum, so effectively smoothed the way to make it possible. 1 Since 1952, Director, U.S. National Arboteum, Washington 25, D.C. * “Azalea” is here used as the popular name for all deciduous or semi-evergreen members of the genus Rhododendron, in which genus they have been combined with the fully evergreen rhododendrons in current botanical practice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREPARATIONS AND DEPARTURE Plans for the collecting trip were laid early in 1951 and one of the first steps consisted of the preparation of a map of the eastern United States which could show by letter and color key the geographic distribution of wild azaleas likely to be in flower during each week from mid-March to mid-August, as discovered from numerous herbarium specimens previously studied. The canvas backing of this little map became very worn before the trip was over, for at every point this was the guide for direction of the next day's travel to catch azaleas in bloom. Then there was a large Rand-McNally atlas with location data for previously collected species. From a glance at this map one could tell where azaleas once grew, where collections had not been made and which points perhaps needed revisiting to clarify some question concerning the original collection. These, plus endless additional maps, were the guides. The equipment was interestingly diverse, consisting of piles of presses, blotters, newspapers and a specially designed electric drier for the pressed specimens; of digging tools, shears, burlap and packing materials for handling the living plants, of the inevitable cameras, labels, tags, and notebooks and of course one's personal living needs for a matter of at least a month or so at a time. For transportation the Arboretum had provided a Chevrolet delivery truck which was most happily selected for size, speed and rideability as was repeatedly proved during the succeeding 5 months of continuous travel over everything from first class roads to trackless hillsides, through the freezing spring floods of the Mississippi or through summer drought at 104 degrees. Into this truck were piled these many supplies in time for a mid-afternoon departure from Philadelphia on Saturday, March I7th. The goal was Florida, for the first azalea on the time schedule of our map. The first run south provided the customary thrill of this rapid journey into springtime: from Pennsylvania winter to quinces and daffodils in Richmond; wisterias in bloom with the exotic azaleas of Charleston; and then in Georgia the potently delightful scent of the Jessamine thicket ( Gelseinitum ) on the damp of the evening air. It is no wonder that this Jessamine is a southern favorite; it is a wonder that it is so seldom seen in Washington or Philadelphia where its Virginia representatives would almost certainly succeed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A FLORIDA START The first azaleas or “Pink Honeysuckles” as a native of the South will always call them, were found with no little excitement along the edges of damp woods on the Florida side of the St. Marys River, along U.S. Route 1. They were plants whose flowers had deep pink tubes and pale to medium pink petals. The corolla tubes and often their supporting pedicel were covered with numerous little pin-head glands and the bud scales and unfolding leaves were hairy with a matted, silky pubescence. The only southern azalea with these several characters is R. canescens , the Florida Pinxter or Hoary Azalea and this indeed was it — as we (Chevvy and I) were destined to follow it for several weeks and over enormous distances. At an appropriate spot, where azaleas were plentiful, my first “mass collection” of 25 or 30 flower-shoot specimens was made by random selection from as many different plants. Each specimen was recorded by number in a notebook; flower measurements were taken, flower colors, plant heights, location and growing conditions were recorded before the specimens were placed between newspapers of the collecting press. During the evening at some tourist court they would be rearranged before placement in the electric drier. Wherever possible, quantity collections of this sort were made at intervals of some 60 miles, with intervening “county collections” of a mere 5 to 8 specimens as more detailed indicators of distribution. A few run-of-the-mill small, living plants were taken at intervals for later study, just as were pieces, when detachable, of the unusual specimens with likely horticultural potentialities. Bundles of dried specimens or packages of accumulated plants were expressed to Philadelphia each week or so. Quest of this early azalea led south as far as Putnam and Alachua Counties in the general vicinity of Gainesville, Florida, but apparently no farther. Just south of here the high dryness of Ocala National Forest was explored with considerable thoroughness but without return, other than in a still vivid experience of driving the truck down a steep sandy and rutted road to a crossing of the Oklawaho River, only to find that the bridge had been washed out in a previous storm. The only negotiable return lay by slow stages through undisturbed woodland with both darkness and the bottom of the gasoline tank staging a neck and neck approach. Ultimately a logging trail was discovered and the rest was of chief significance in teaching a lesson in preparedness which stood us in good stead on several later occasions. At Gainesville I took the opportunity to check native azaleas in the herbarium of the University of Florida and also to spend several instructive hours with Dr. H. H. Hume in search of azaleas and hollies of the area before again following R. canescens northwest. Apparently skipping the coastal counties of Lafayette, Taylor, etc; it reappeared in fine quantity on the banks of the Suwannee River near White Springs, where on a warn day it was being worked by honey bees, bumble bees and butterflies. It reappeared very conspicuously with dogwood on crossing the Fall Line in Madison County and it became evident that southward occurrences in this region are only, in fact, in very localized pockets, often widely separated. Still travelling west, this azalea reached perhaps a peak in quantity on the banks of the Yellow River in Okaloosa County where bushes became small trees of 15 ft. or more with heavy, branching trunks. It reached a second peak across the Sabine River in east Texas where the flowers seemed somewhat larger, their tubes longer and the leaves less hairy than in Florida and Georgia. Pure white forms and deep purple-red ones, those with large flowers and small ones with yellow blotches or with delightful scent — all were found during the next six weeks which eventually revealed a distribution of this species from the South Carolina coast around the Gulf to the Trinity River in Texas and north across Arkansas and Mississippi to southern Tennessee and southern North Carolina. It clearly covers an enormous area whose only major gaps are the neutral soils of the Mississippi Valley, the Red Hills of Mississippi and Alabama and a few regions not generally suited to ericaceous plants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A YELLOW AZALEA The first westward trip with R. canescens brought my introduction to the yellow Florida Azalea, R. austrinum , on March 26th near Geneva, Alabama, and in enormous quantity a few hours later along a woodland edge just south of the Florida-Alabama border. Apart from flower color, the general characters of this azalea are rather similar to those of R. canescens but it is more glandular. The little glistening red, pin-head glands cover pedicels and often vegetative shoots, as well as flower tubes. The flower may be wholly a clear, golden yellow or, more often, the petals may be yellow and tubes a variable strawberry red, giving one the impression that this red tube belongs more properly with R. canescens and has perhaps been acquired by R. austrinum after flowering at the same time along the same streamsides and producing a proportion of those unmistakably anemic buff-colored hybrids for many years past. As the banks of the Yellow River grow luxuriant R. canescens so elsewhere they are appropriately covered with masses of the yellow “Florida” Azalea which was subsequently found to occupy a sizeable portion of wester n Florida, southeast Mississippi, southern Alabama, and southwest Georgia — about as much territory outside of Florida as in. Later collections of R. austrinum were made on the return from Texas on a more northerly swing. Spring was advancing and R. canescens was in collecting condition as far east as Georgia's Altamaha River where it occurs in masses of rich pinks almost across from Old Fort Barrington and the former haunts of the long-lost Franklinia .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND SOME VARIATIONS Several curiosities had shown up: we had seen pure white canescens but in southern Alabama there were whites and pale pinks with yellow blotches and with the lemon scent of R. alabamense , yet they could not be identified as this species. At one point a woodland glade was surrounded by a bizarre display in yellow, orange, white-pink, salmon and every intermediate color one might name. Several of these plants were sent back, earmarked as progeny from an apparent triple union between R. canescens , austrinum , and alabamense . On a quick return across central Georgia and Alabama a curious break in R. canescens was found on the hills of northwest Alabama and across into Mississippi in which the flowers were somewhat smaller, of uniform color (lacking the red tube) and were often yellow blotched and scented. Through later collections, this variable assortment, typical of nothing in particular, was traced as far north as Cumberland County on Tennessee's Cumberland Plateau. Obviously they had points in common with the hybrid swarms above, but they are widespread, much older and almost certainly contain a dash of R. nudiflorum rather than the austrinum of the last mentioned mixture. Rains had been heavy during the course of a too early search for R. alabamense proper and it was a mud covered Chevrolet that approached Atlanta, Georgia on the 20th of April to collect mail, replenish supplies and permit a brief pause for scheduled meetings with Jesse C. Nicholls, the azalea-conscious salamander purveyor of Murphy, North Carolina and with W. P. Lemmon of nearby Marietta, student of southern azaleas and authority for three recently described species.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE RED AZALEA OF GEORGIA A few miles southwest of Atlanta our attention was momentarily caught by a splash of brilliant orange in a woodlot not far from the road. Brakes were promptly applied and subsequent investigation revealed an assortment of plants, 2—3 ft. high, in oranges, orange-reds, salmons and strong pinks. Unlike our collections to this point, these flowers were distinct in being almost totally devoid of pin-head glands, just as the leaves seemed nearly hairless on their undersides. Only one Georgia azalea fits a description of this sort and that is “red-flowered” R. speciosum , the Oconee Azalea, which during the next day or so was pursued from here to north of Atlanta, across central Georgia to Augusta, and down the Savannah River to Clyo in the vicinity of its original place of discovery by Andre Michaux at Two Sisters Ferry. Not particular as to habitats in central Georgia, the Oconee Azalea is a rather confused species in this region. One can guess that it has been on too familiar terms with aggressive R. canescens for some time — with results becoming evident through individuals with large, salmon or strong pink flowers, with small red flowers with orange blotches or with variability in their possession of pin-head glands or leaf tomentum. Such variants thrive on level ground in warm, sunny places. On the Savannah River a more uniform Oconee Azalea remains an inhabitant of the fairly shady red clay bluffs of the west bank where specimens may be found in excellent deep Saturn red — a red of the Coastal Plain which is unlikely to fade under cultivation. At Two Sisters Ferry the present farm owner told me that he gave up the last ferry boat about thirty years ago. The old road to the river has long since grown up to brush but some aged orange-flowered specimens of R. speciosum still grow near the boat landing, just as Michaux saw and described them in 1787. This is a handsome azalea which has already become so scarce that protective measures might well be considered by those who love the wild plants of Georgia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BY THE ATLANTIC TO VIRGINIA Descent of the Savannah River in search of the Oconee Azalea had also led by design towards Beaufort County, South Carolina, which lies across the river on the Atlantic coast, due east of Clyo; but to cross the river one must necessarily travel very nearly to Savannah itself, which happened to be convenient for dispatching plants and for procuring labels and other needed supplies. Beaufort County, South Carolina, is the “type locality” for the Coast Azalea, R. atlanticum , which according to our map should be in flower at the end of April. Our lead was correct for on April 27th the first plants were found in quantity not far from Burton where they held splendid pink blossoms knee high above fern and inkberry in the moist soils of cutover oak woodland. From this point, and with sundry detours, the Coast Azalea was followed in constant flower through the coastal counties of the Carolinas and Virginia and, with a week or two's break, to its most northerly distributional point on the Delmarva peninsula in Delaware. Here in Delaware it is still a low growing azalea; it is generally white flowered and often highly glandular with pin-head glands on leaves and shoots as well as on the flower parts; the leaves may be glaucous beneath. It would seem likely that such plants as these are most akin to the original form of this azalea and that the pink flowered and less glandular representatives of South Carolina and Virginia may imply a measure of genic interchange with pink flowered R. canescens and nudiflorum of these regions. In late April and early May the Coast Azalea makes truly a splendid sight as a multihued understory to the open pine woods of the coastal Carolinas. Since it is highly stoloniferous it recovers promptly in the wake of the brush fire or roadside trimming or grazing so that the year following will again see hundreds of upright flower clusters on wiry, knee-high stems borne by one plant an acre or more in extent. A mass collection of separate clones may necessitate covering a considerable territory to be sure that the 25 or 30 specimens are indeed different. The course from Savannah to Norfolk, Virginia in search of R. atlanticum sounds very direct as just described. It is a distance of 500 road miles which was actually logged on the speedometer at a little more than twice this amount or 1200 miles — which is a fair illustration of the difference between plant collecting and just driving from one point to another! In this particular case the more inland pink azaleas of the Piedmont, R. canescens and nudiflorum , were also in flower so that the interior counties of the Carolinas were covered in a fairly thorough fashion on a zig-zag route which hit back to the coast at intervals instead of merely following it. These side excursions were productive of many specimens and several valuable pieces of information. In South Carolina they yielded material from hybrid swarms obviously involving both R. canescens and atlanticum which are interesting as an indication that a measure of gene exchange does occur between these species; also in South Carolina it was discovered that the inland red clay hills of the Piedmont, which lie roughly between Columbia and Greenville, support very few azaleas. These hills grow excellent red cedar and have a soil pH often in the vicinity of 7.0, which is doubtless the explanation; and finally, in southern North Carolina, was discovered the interesting area of geographic overlap between southern R. canescens and northern nudiflorum as represented by pink flowered azaleas whose morphology might well test the patience of any precise taxonomist (and as they doubtless have).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A VIRGINIA TRANSECT Saturday, May 5th, dawned a soft, spring day amid the attractions of Colonial Williamsburg; but it was an unusual tourist who departed as early as he had arrived late, having spent time to enjoy no more than a bed and a passing view of the Palace Green in his hurry to catch as many as possible of the “honeysuckles” now blooming from here to Alabama and the mid west. Of immediate concern was a planned sampling of the Virginia population of R. nudiflorum as it extends from Chesapeake Bay and the habitat of R. atlanticum to the Blue Ridge and the mountain home of the northern Roseshell Azalea, R. roseum . Variation in the Pinxterbloom Azalea had already posed some questions upon which a transect sampling of this kind was expected to shed light. Mass collections of R. nudiflorum were made in Gloucester County at the mouth of the Chesapeake and were continued across the state at intervals of approximately forty miles to the base of the Blue Ridge near Sperryville. From this point collections were made at each 500 ft. increase in elevation to the top of Pinnacle Peak in the Shenandoah National Park, permission to make such collections in the National Parks and Forests of the East having been obtained during the planning stages of the expedition. One of the exciting finds was at the start of this run, not far from Gloucester, Va., where among some cut-back Pinxterblooms near the roadside was one with perhaps the most remarkable coloring I saw anywhere. It was a large blossom in an intense plum purple with strong yellow blotch. There was only one flower head which I cut for a specimen and after measuring, recording and pressing the collection I returned to dig the plant for horticultural use. But unhappily my “find” was already a loss for the small plant could nowhere be found in the heavy brush. Henceforth I learned to dig first and cut afterward — or mark the plant! At the western end of this transect, azaleas were only just coming into flower at low elevations of the Blue Ridge on this first visit on May 7th. On a return on May 21st, similar azaleas were collectible to two-thirds up the mountain. Completion of the transect at the highest elevations was not possible until June 2nd, or in other words an elevation increase of approximately 2400 ft. delayed flowering by almost a month. By this time (May 8th) R. alabamense , an azalea on which more information is needed, was surely coming into flower in Alabama. This, therefore, was the direction chosen after a brief stop for packing and mailing a good batch of specimens. This time the route kept to the western edge of Virginia and the Carolinas to secure one more coverage of R. nudiflorum and canescens before striking into Georgia where the latter species was now just about over. A call was made at the University of Georgia in Athens before heading north via Gainesville to the mountains of Lumpkin County for a check on Flame Azalea in the vicinity of Neel Gap. Early R. calendulaceum was full out in clear yellows to deep orange in Vogel State Park; it was also seen in exceptionally large flowered specimens in a small ravine just north of Gainesville. One or two of these had such brilliantly red color that one instinctively thought of the Oconee Azalea growing not too far south — and wondered whether this red in Georgia calendulaceum might have a rather special significance. Again heading Southwest, it was on May 12th that the first true R. alabamense was found in full flower on the same hilltop in Marshall County of North Central Alabama where they had been seen in tight bud almost a month earlier. It was a real thrill to find this beautiful little white azalea with its dainty, thin-tubed flowers, yellow blotched and deliciously lemon scented. In its “best” individuals this azalea of the Alabama hills is also low growing and quite stoloniferous, it bears foliage which is often glaucous beneath — and as glandular as that of white flowered, low growing and stoloniferous R. atlanticum of coastal Delaware. R. alabamense is obviously later flowering than R. canescens but the two have nevertheless hybridized to produce numerous intermediate individuals, intermediate in flowering time, often taller glowing than the true Alabama Azalea and varying in color from pure or yellow-blotched white to pinks, often without the deep pink tube of canescens proper. As it is followed through Cullman and Winston Counties the Alabama Azalea is found very much on the fairly dry hilltops and often on the eastern slopes where it seems tolerant of considerably more shade than R. canescens . Still white flowered but taller growing and in less “pure” form, it leaves the wooded hilltops to flow down sunny slopes to the Sipsey River in a mantle of May snow, as far as the eye can see. In such places, though without such pronounced fragrance, this is unquestionably the clearest and showiest of all white native azaleas. Much as one would have liked to linger in this intriguing collecting area, the azaleas of the north were now calling much too loudly — calendulaceum , atlanticum north of Virginia, roseum and nudiflorum in Pennsylvania and New York, and so on; and none of them would wait. But information was still needed on the early azaleas of Tennessee. A route was consequently taken due north across the Tennessee River in the vicinity of Mussel Shoals, then east through southern Tennessee to the rising escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. Other hills of northern Alabama were covered with the confusing R. canescens-alabamense complex mentioned earlier but good R. canescens was again found in the occasional sphagnum bogs which are scattered across the red soil land of southern Tennessee. These red soils are interspersed with limestone outcrops, and produce abundant black locust and red cedar, but few azaleas, except in these upland bogs. If these boggy areas are followed northeast from Fayetteville towards McMinnville, Tennessee, their azalea populations undergo a hesitant transition from R. canescens towards nudiflorum , settling down as relatively “pure” nudiflorum in the lowlands of Cumberland County. But the picture is quite different if we proceed directly east from Fayetteville and ascend the escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau. From below Sewanee the lower limestone strata are overlain with sand-stone and beyond this point azaleas are immediately abundant in a confused complex reminiscent of R. canescens , nudiflorum and alabamense — all thoroughly mixed together and varying in flower color from pure white to lavender, pale pink with pale tubes and pink with deep red tubes, many of the plants being highly stoloniferous. On the plateau this complex again extends north for 70 miles or more to Cumberland County, just as we have already followed it across northern Alabama from Mississippi. On the southern edge of the Crab Orchard Mountains in Cumberland County a small detour was taken to explore Grassy Cove, a limestone sink of such proportions that farms and a small village are found on the level fertile floor of the huge hole sunken many hundreds of feet below the present level of the plateau. It has its own meandering river which flows northwest to disappear into a gaping cavern, and then changes its direction beneath a mountain whose lowest pass is 1000 ft. above the cove floor. It eventually reappears as the Sequatchie River flowing south towards Chattanooga. This was but one of so many marvels of scenery whose exploration and enjoyment was a constantly fascinating accompaniment to this quest for azaleas. From Grassy Cove the route lay down the scenic Sequatchie Valley with side excursions to the plateau ridges on either side. On the upper sandstones azaleas remained abundant but on the limestone valley floor they occur only along occasional streamsides amid sandstone boulders washed from the upper slopes. It was repeatedly observed that azaleas grow in limestone areas, often abundantly, but detailed observation invariably reveals a situation like the above or a restriction to leached hilltop soils a few inches or a few feet in thickness as they cap the limestone ridges of Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. Leaving the Sequatchie Valley by striking east over the Walden Ridge the road descended into the Great Valley of the Tennessee River. It crossed the river and valley in a south-easterly direction and ascended the foothills of the southern Appalachian Mountains in the vicinity of the Cherokee National Forest. Apart from the appall- Map of Skinner's itinerary through the Southern and mid-Atlantic area. ing vegetational desolation resulting from copper smelting in the Copperhill-Ducktown region of Polk Co., Tennessee, the uplands of this southern mountain area present some of the finest scenery and most luxuriant forest cover discoverable in the East. Across into North Carolina the great National Forest of Nantahala is named for the Indians' “Land of the Noonday Sun.” Here the valley sides are so steep that direct sunlight is soon lost, while an annual rainfall of over eighty inches is only matched on this continent in local areas of the Pacific Northwest. Within this forest an initial visit was made to the summit of 5400 ft. Wayah Bald, native habitat of R. arborescens var Richardsonii as recognized by Rehder. But the mountain is populated by only late flowering azaleas, none of which were yet open. However, typical large flowered R. calendulaceum was found in full flower at lower altitudes on entering North Carolina and was thus followed to Asheville and well up into Virginia. A half day pause was made at Asheville and the Biltmore Estate to examine a part of Louis Shelton's diversified charge — the Beadle collection of native azaleas, which without question is the finest anywhere assembled. The visit was especially enjoyable in the instructive company of Sylvester Owens, who assisted in collecting the many hundreds of plants and in whose immediate understanding care they fortunately remain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS Back in Virginia R. roseum and nudiflorum were still in flower and in the Jefferson National Forest on a hill slope near Konnarock a collection was made of an interesting group of triple hybrids involving these two species and R. calendulaceum — which would imply the somewhat puzzling combinations of two diploids and a tetraploid if published chromosome counts have actual application in the wild. The hybrid progeny included small, sweet scented pinks with yellow blotches all the way to salmon yellows of the same flower size as normal Flame Azalea. Farther North a second especially interesting stop was at Peaks of Otter in the Blue Ridge where a transect was run down the west side of Broad Top Mountain. This transect took five hours to accomplish and was decided upon after brief analysis of intermediate elements of a continuous azalea cover which runs from elegant, highly glandular R. roseum on the mountain top through transitional stages of vari-colored, stoloniferous individuals to “good” R. nudiflorlum at lower elevations conveniently reached by a gravel road sharply descending from the much-traveled Skyline Parkway. Taking a somewhat westerly detour, the next main stopping point was a return visit to the Shenandoah National Park for further collections on the Pinnacle Peak transect after obtaining maps and much helpful advice from Park Naturalist Paul Favor. This was on May 21st and time was passing. With the last specimen tucked away — around 6 p.m. it seemed increasingly imperative to reach Delaware as soon as possible for a last collection of Coast Azaleas. The road lay via Washington and the Annapolis ferry, the new Bay Bridge being as yet under construction. With a pause for a joint gas tank and personal refueling in Washington the one hundred and twelve miles to Annapolis was completed still in time to find lodgings for the night. Crossing the Chesapeake by ferry early next morning a search was begun for Choptank Mills, Delaware, this being a remembered collecting locality of Philadelphia's Witmer Stone in 1904. Exclusive of type localities this was one of the few occasions on which a former collecting site was deliberately sought, in this case to save time. But the opposite results were secured. Choptank Mills was not on the map; by telegraph inquiry it was unknown to the State Police of Delaware, Maryland or Virginia or even to the Postmistress of Choptank — after a lengthy drive to locate this tiny, unhurried village at the mouth of the Choptank River in Maryland. No Coast Azalea was seen and only one clue remained to investigate: the Choptank River did have a source in Delaware as a small stream in the vicinity of Sandtown. By this time we were driving the Atlantic side of the peninsula and a few azaleas had been located; at Sandtown, however, they suddenly appeared in such abundance in pure white to pale pink flowers for roadside miles that at least the ghost of Choptank Mills of 1904 must surely be nearby! Most of this was splendid dwarf, stoloniferous and highly glandular R. atlanticum , the kind of plant one could easily regard as a prototype of the rather confused canescens — friendly representatives of its South Carolina “type locality” — and a single plant of it would have been well worth the time and mileage of the search to find it. Back to Philadelphia that evening and the enjoyment of three whole days of complete relaxation, only passingly devoted to checking specimens, restocking supplies and generally preparing for the last short haul of another nine or ten weeks in the field.

      <field name="heading_text">IN SEARCH OF NATIVE AZALEAS HENRY T. SKINNER (Continued from page 10)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEW YORK AND WESTWARD A check of the flowering guide at this stage indicated the need for northern samples of the early species and for more westerly collections of both these and R. calendulaceum . Accordingly on May 26th a route was chosen via the Pocono Mountain area of northern Pennsylvania to the Finger Lake region of central New York for Pinxterbloom and Rose Shell Azaleas — or for what passes as these two species after their too rapid or too sociable post-glacial trek to the Carolina Hills of Ithaca. They were here in abundant bloom, in excellent color and in oft-proved hardiness but both species are a little more like one another than are R. roseum and nudiflorum of Virginia— a fact which has worried both botanist and azalea growers of the north on more than one occasion. Good collections of New York State Pinkshell were also made in the entertaining company of Dr. C. G. (Rhododendron) Bowers in the hills above Binghamton. Travelling southwest into Pennsylvania the same azaleas were now getting past bloom except for some very showy specimens of R. nudiflorum in the high and late-season plateau area of Somerset County, Pennsylvania. On further into West Virginia R. roseum and nudiflorum were in flower at higher elevations and in the region south of Morgantown and Elkins R. calendulaceum was abundant in the early, large flowered form in shades of yellow to deep orange. Recognizing a possibly parallel situation to that in certain of the native blueberries Dr. W. H. Camp had earlier suggested that orange R. calendulaceum in this evidently tetraploid early flowering phase may quite logically represent a species originally derived from early hybridization between diploid red and yellow progenitors. Towards furnishing proof for this hypothesis an evident need was the field discovery of such suitable red and yellow diploid azaleas, if they should still be in existence. The Oconee Azalea is a red with suitable characters except perhaps, its time of flowering, and at this stage of collecting it was hoped that a small-flowered, fairly late, clear yellow azalea might perchance be found on some secluded slope of these westerly hills of the Virginias, Kentucky or in the Ozarks. Anticipating our story we can say that a late flowering diploid yellow was never found, and probably never existed but the diligent though fruitless search for it covered many square miles of territory and was always interesting. A number of unusual yellows actually turned up in West Virginia, in Kentucky, Georgia and Tennes- see but always they were solitary plants and usually the product of hybridization between a late phase of R. calendulaceum and either R. arborescens or viscosum .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HYBRIDS One of the very interesting hybrid swarms was found on June 14 on the eastern slope of Spruce Knob Mountain in West Virginia. The plants were scattered through an abandoned pasture in a region where R. calendulaceum , nudiflorum and roseum all grew and bloomed together. The progeny of these triple matings were bizarre in the extreme — short and tall bushes bearing large or small flowers in every color from coral pink through salmons to rich lavender, pale yellow or pure white. The last was large flowered and otherwise identical with the Flame Azalea. Such happenings, exciting to the horticulturist, could obviously be most confusing when unexpectedly encountered in an herbarium where such specimens customarily lack any reference to flower color or to peculiarities of their occurrence. White-flowered hybrid progeny seem relatively frequent when parental R. nudiflorum is involved. Returning to Virginia, final collections were made from the highest elevations of the Pinnacle Mountain transect before again striking southwest for later investigation of the more southern species. A later flowering and somewhat redder phase of Flame Azalea was found in partially open bud on White Top Mountain and High Nob in southwest Virginia, at a time when the last blossoms of the normal large and orange-flowered R. calendulaceum were scattered on the lower slopes. This same joint occurrence was likewise met on June 6th on Big Black Mountain in Kentucky, only here at the higher elevation of over 4100 ft. the later “Camp's Red” phase of the summit would obviously not be at its best for another two weeks or more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN QUEST OF R. cumberlandense Planning a return to the interesting azaleas of Black Mountain, we headed northwest for a general Kentucky reconnaissance in an eleven county circular swing to Yahoo Ridge, type locality for R. cumberlandense at the Kentucky end of the Cumberland Plateau. Within a few miles the first little red and red-orange flowered azalea plants were found on a ridge of Pine Mountain in Letcher County, an azalea which in “best” forms makes a low, twiggy bush, often quite stoloniferous, with glossy green leaves often glaucous beneath and which may or more probably may not be quite the same as the late azalea of Black Mountain. At least on Pine Mountain this is undoubtedly R. cumberlandense of E. L. Braun's description and its smaller, thin-tubed flowers are immediately suggestive of a diploid if the earlier, coarsely large-flowered Flame Azalea is truly tetraploid — a point to be tested by later cytological examination of living plants collected for this purpose. Leaving Pine Mountain there was an interval of several miles in which only normal R. calendulaceum , past bloom, was seen, but again at higher elevation in Owsley County beautiful little geranium-red azaleas were in shining bloom on a rocky cliff face; they remained with us in Clay County in Laurel County and in fact seemed quite Common throughout these wooded hills of southeast Kentucky, all the way to Yahoo Ridge where the type locality for R. cumberlandense was revisited with the aid of detailed directions kindly furnished by Dr. Braun. Unfortunately the station where Braun had collected some time after logging operations in 1935 was now so rapidly reforesting that the shade was becoming heavy and the azaleas poor — a rotation which was frequently observed on this journey. Again and again the most striking displays of azaleas were in open woodland which had obviously been logged, cleared or burnt a few years previously. Presumably it is the scattered parent plants which burst into bloom with the sudden sunlight, set abundant seed and populate the forest floor before young trees again almost shade them out. In the long view one gains the impression of ephemeral, constantly shifting populations, except perhaps in the case of conservative R. prunifolium of West Georgia or R. speciosum of the Savannah River. By the average plant age the latter species seem to have occupied the same territory for many years. They reproduce sparingly. As noted in this region perhaps the finest single Kentucky collecting point for the Cumberland Azalea was on a fire tower hill in west central Knox County. The road up this hill was one of those eroded rock and mud affairs which may have been passable to a jeep in good weather but which caused the Chevrolet to rest quietly near the main highway during an attack on foot. The hill was covered with open deciduous forest and towards the top, flowing over the ridges and down the sides of steep gullies was a multicolored riot of azaleas. It must have been a fairly old growth for while some of the flat-topped bushes were only waist-high others were well above eye level, indicating that fair height is attained by this species, at least in partial ,shade. Under these conditions, and compared with normal Flame Azalea, the flowers seemed especially thin-tubed and delicate and with a color luminosity, in the filtered sunlight, which the other wholly lacks. The shades of color were infinitely and widely variable from pale straw yellow through yellow-orange to red, and from salmon through pink to translucent cerise as lively as shot silk. Such diversity was often later found, although a constant leaning toward orange-red and red suggests that the latter may possibly have been the original color of this azalea. Having confirmed the Kentucky occurrence of this distinct phase of former R. calendulaceum the next obvious task was to determine with some accuracy the limits of its distribution. So far it had been confined to the northern heights of the dissected west escarpment of the Cumberland Plateau so that a logical course was to follow this westerly escarpment southward — and the decision proved a wise one. Leaving Kentucky on the 9th of June, this same little azalea was followed in comparative abundance into the upland woods of Scott County, Tennessee, into Fentress County, Overton County, Van Buren County, Sequatchie County, both west of the Sequatchie Valley and to the east on Signal Mountain. From here we were headed for Georgia — and the azalea was there too on Fort Mountain in Murray County. Continuing at about 3000 ft. elevation (in contrast to early R. calendulaceum of the lower mountain slopes) it was found towards the summit of Mt. Oglethorpe in Pickens County, and on Branch Mountain in Dawson County. It was on this mountain that a spot of brilliant red, like a scarlet tail-light, shone from the top of a cliff bordering the new highway 136. This little beacon was too fascinating to pass up, even though the only approach lay by way of a long flanking climb. But the reward was a tiny, twiggy, rock-clinging azalea plant 6 inches high, a foot across, gray leaved and covered like a pin cushion with its little red bells — as extreme a form of this R. cumberlandense as one could hope to find and a gem for the garden if its habitat is not unduly altered by cultivation. Traveling northeast into adjacent Lumpkin County the azalea stays with us near Woody Gap. In Union County it is especially abundant on the mountain slopes above Lake Winnfield Scott and not far away, just east of Wolfpen Gap in Vogel State Park, it covers a hillside in a billowy patchwork of clear yellow, orange, orange-red, cerise and all shades of salmony pink to apricot — both colors and plants so reminiscent of those of our fire tower hill in Kentucky that even before making a detailed check of less obvious characters one could scarcely doubt that this was the same Kentucky azalea. But was it? This particular spot happened to have been sought out by design for it is the type locality of R. Bakeri described by Lemmon and McKay in 1937, four years before R. cumberlandense was named by Braun from Yahoo Ridge. Since both descriptions fit these plants with reasonable accuracy it would seem that this gay little bush of the Cumberland Plateau must soon shed its dual personality to be recognized by the single, prior, though less happily descriptive name of R. Bakeri . Here in Georgia its color may tend slightly more toward the yellow and yellow-orange and its flowers may be slightly larger than when it was seen in Kentucky but such differences would seem to be of very minor consequence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CONFUSION IN MACON COUNTY Still anxious to find where else this little late red azalea might be, another visit was next paid to the Nantahala region of North Carolina, a few miles across the Georgia border. The first plants were found in a deep valley on the approach to Wayah Bald from the west. The plants were 2 ft. high in stoloniferous patches deep red in color and just coming into bloom at this higher elevation. But they were not alone. On all sides were bushes in a bewildering array of colors, of heights to fifteen feet or more and of flower sizes to 6 centimeters across the “wing” petals. Either R. Bakeri had gone crazy or it had met up with something else. The latter seems probably the better guess, for not far away were a few late-flowering individuals of normal, early Flame Azalea. The sampling and collecting of this amazing population consumed a full half day during which time the characteristics of these intermediates became reasonably familiar. Finally heading to Nantahala Lake and Wayah Bald, imagine our astonishment at discovering that the fast opening azalea display around the lake and well up the slopes of the mountain was composed not of R. Bakeri or “normal” calendulaceum but entirely of recurring batches of these vari-colored intermediates which eventually settled down to something resembling a reasonably uniform “type” of their own. * Other collections were made on later visits to this region, and many more in principally orange and orange-red colors were subsequently found at higher elevations (above 3000 ft.) north through the mountains and right back again to southwest Virginia and Kentucky. A seeming third phase of the R. calendulaceum complex presents a puzzling pattern which will need much further study for elucidation of its true nature and origin; but the fact of its existence begins to shed light on the confusing flowering-time behavior of R. calendulaceum from different collection sources.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AND INTO ALABAMA Having followed the Cumberland Azalea to Georgia and North Carolina there remained the possibility that it might also occur in Alabama — since the Cumberland Plateau enters into the northeastern part of this state. On the eighteenth of June the Chevrolet was consequently headed towards Jackson County, Alabama. Along the way some excellent Sweet Azalea, R. arborescens , was found in full flower, white with pale yellow blotch, growing with Catawba Rhododendron in a moist valley near Cloudland in DeKalb County and again not far away, while after crossing the Tennessee River and making a sharp climb of the steep ascent of the plateau north from Scottsboro in Jackson County abundant Cumberland Azalea was still in flower in open forest near Kyles on Crow Mountain. It was certainly in northern Alabama and on reflecting the matter in camp that night there came a wild thought of Alabama's highest point, isolated Mt. Cheaha, a hundred miles south in Talladega County. Pulling a long shot, we packed lunch next morning, took to the mountain road which became poorer and very dusty through the forest climb up Cheaha, and by noon were enjoying this lunch seated amid Cumberland Azalea right on the summit of the mountain! They were a little past bloom but there was ample color to aid recognition of this gratifying find at a lone point so far from Kentucky and Yahoo Ridge. But this was no large batch of azaleas; beneath the windbent oaks were perhaps a few hundred plants in this colony which must have been isolated for a very long time. It was hoped that they might show something more of original characters or flower color but on superficial examination they were similar indeed to the little azalea we had followed so far. It is of passing interest that Rehder did not record the existence of a calendulaceum -like azalea in Alabama and that the reference in the Eighth Edition of Gray's Manual should properly refer to the Cumberland Azalea rather than to R. calendulaceum proper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE TEXAS AZALEA Two further geographic possibilities remained for this fascinating plant, the southward extension of the Cumherland Plateau south of the Tennessee River in North Central Alabama and — a very long shot — the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma which has azaleas and certain interesting representatives of other eastern plants. The next day, June 20th, was spent in the R. alabamense hills of Cullman and Winston Counties, but only late forms of the latter species were found, no Cumberland Azalea since the hills are perhaps too low and, strangely, not even any R. arborescens , which had been expected. No collections were made on the long drive through,Hot Springs, Arkansas to Mt. Ida for the night but luck was better during the next two days coverage of the principal mountain peaks of the Ouachita and Boston Mountains, the length of Rich Mountain and adjacent LeFlore County, Oklahoma, impressive Magazine Mountain, Flat Top Mountain and northerly White Rock Mountain in Franklin County, Arkansas. There was no Cumberland Azalea as had been vaguely hoped but local R. oblongifolium , the Texas Azalea, was found in several places with sufficient plants still in flower for at least representative collections. This generally white and rather small flowered species is confusing in that it so frequently grows side by side with a pubescent-leaved pink azalea akin to R. roseum , and evidently breeds with it; the white form may be more adapted to moist valley sites and the other to drier hillside slopes but the line of preference is not strong. There is needed an earlier season and more careful study of these Ozark plants than was possible in this too rapid survey. On the third morning in Arkansas, on June 24th, the car was again headed back towards the now-passing eastern azaleas. It chanced to be a Sunday, with Sunday drivers in slow lines on the highways but nevertheless nearly 600 miles were covered before nightfall in eastern Kentucky. No azaleas were collected; none was seen and they were doubtless sparse to nonexistent over most of the rich agricultural land traversed. * Though not realized at the time. distinctive qualities of the Flame Azalea of the Nantahala region have previously been pointed out by Braun in The Red Azalea of the Cumberlands , Rhodora. 43: 33. 1941.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BACK TO THE ALLEGHENIES The next week was spent in a run north through the mountains of Virginia and West Virginia and back south into Tennessee and North Carolina in quest of late forms of R. calendulaceum and of northerly R. arborescens and viscosum , wherever it might occur. A last visit was paid to the late red azaleas of Kentucky's Big Black Mountain and more of the Cumberland Azalea was found in Wise County, Virginia, but farther east at elevations of 3000 ft. and above it gave way to the late phase of R. calendulaceum , mentioned earlier, which was also of plentiful occurrence on the high points of the Alleghenies from Grandfather Mountain and Mt. Pisgah, west to the Tennessee border. Throughout this tour the Sweet Azalea was fairly plentiful along streamsides of the upland valleys and in some places, as at Mountain Lake, Virginia, and on Great Pisgah in North Carolina, it was hybridizing freely with R. viscosum to produce variable and often pink-flowered hybrids quite similar to entire populations seen in northern Pennsylvania a month later. The Sweet Azalea tends to be quite variable, in certain characteristics and throughout its range from New England to Georgia and Alabama. It may be variable in habit from low, widespreading and bushy in open places to tall and leggy in denser woods; its foliage may be glaucous beneath or entirely green; its corolla may be pure white or carry yellow blotches of varying intensity and in flower size it may be a plant of mediocre attraction to one of quite outstanding quality. A clone with especially large and showy flowers was found on the east fork of the Pigeon River in Pisgah National Forest but others almost equally good were seen at intervals. Such individuals from the horticultural standpoint were quite superior to over-extolled “var. Richardsonii ” of Wayah Bald whose flowers are medium in size and whose dwarfness seems a product of wind-swept exposure which is not expressed in the forest shelter at a few feet lower elevation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A MOUNTAIN-TOP MARVEL A fine fourth of July found the Chevrolet headed towards headquarters of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, but wisdom prevailed in time for the effective substitution of a collecting detour over little-travelled Max Patch Mountain. Holiday makers had thinned somewhat by the next day, permitting a visit to Park Headquarters for the advice of Arthur Stupka, Park Naturalist, concerning the azaleas of the park and especially of now famous Gregory Bald on the park's southern rim. Representatives of the Gregory Bald population, as col- lected earlier by W. H. Camp, had been inconclusively studied previously and there was a real need to discover what this puzzling situation might actually be. Mr. Stupka was helpful indeed in providing access to the Park Herbarium and in giving suggestions on approaches to Gregory. A day's food supplies were laid in, the distance was covered to Cades Cove, a pack was made up with temporary presses, photographic equipment and a blanket and the stiff 4 1/2 mile climb to the mountain top was started in rather late afternoon. A cabin at about 4,900 ft. elevation was reached at dusk, leaving just time to complete the distance to the summit for a preview of the azalea display before cooking supper and turning in for a night's rest. Unfortunately the “night's rest” was enjoyed in the damp cold against which one blanket afforded little protection. It was also amid rather noisy wildlife from inquisitively reconnoitering mice to larger creatures, perhaps bears, which by morning had spirited away my lone loaf of bread. But there was enough food for a good breakfast and with warming sunlight and the azaleas, discomforts were soon forgotten. The azaleas of Gregory Bald are at first glance bewildering and almost unbelievable. The mountain is a true “bald” having a broad, grassy summit fringed by scrub trees leading quickly into vigorous deciduous forest. The origin of the bald is unknown but it is probably man-made, resultant from earlier Indian grazing. It is the marginal region between trees and the grass sod which supports a peripheral band of a bizzarre collection of azaleas — thousands of plants in every imaginable hue from pure white to pale yellow, salmon yellow, clear pink and orange-red to red. Many of the flowers are yellow blotched, many of the hushes are stoloniferous and foliage varies from normal to deep glossy green, often glaucous beneath. Obviously it is a complicated hybrid swarm dating, in the older plants, to perhaps thirty years ago when some happening such as a brush or forest fire may have been responsible for the start of this strange and fascinating collection. Assuming that these were in fact hybrids the evident procedure was to search for the species which might have been involved in the hybridization process. The red and red-orange colors were an obvious lead and hushes of a Bakeri -like late flowering phase of R. calendulaceum were soon recognized, particularly on the west and southern sides of the bald. Such azaleas had been observed lower on the trail on the approach to the summit. From previous experience the clear pinks suggested hybridization between a red and white and white clones gave surer evidence of a parent of this color. Glossy leaves and glabrous shoots suggested that one such white might well be R. arborescens . A quick search for this species was unsuccessful but it too had been seen on the approach to Gregory Bald. That it actually grew in the vicinity of the Bald has since been confirmed by F. C. Galle of the University of Tennessee who has made a special study of this population. In the search for R. arborescens a visit was paid to nearby Parson Bald a mile to the south and on this mountain was found a splendid growth of a second white azalea, the dwarf and stoloniferous form of the Swamp Azalea, R. viscosum , var. montanum whose characteristic small, sticky flowers and suckering root system had also been recognized as being carried by many of the Gregory Hybrids. R. viscosum may have been growing on Gregory itself or its pollen could easily have been carried this short distance by flying insects. Certainly it, with the other two species mentioned, was involved as an original parent of these plants. These three species are the only ones likely to be met at this elevation and in this particular region. Full collections were made of the Gregory population for later detailed study. While hybrid swarms involving as many species are not rare among eastern azaleas, no other yet seen has equaled this one in impressive size and effect. While many of the plants are beautiful from the horticultural standpoint it is fortunate that they are protected by National Park authorities for all to enjoy. Each color could be simply reproduced by cross-pollinating the same species under artificial conditions. The study and photographing of this collection was still not complete by dusk, necessitating a second night on the mountain which was rendered slightly more comfortable by a harvest of fern fronds for softness and a little warmth. Dry cereal provided a slim breakfast next morning but work was completed in time for a rapid descent starting by noon. Being reasonably close to Knoxville, Tennessee, a visit was paid to the University to discuss azalea problems with members of the Department of Botany and to review briefly a fine set of herbarium material well worthy of later study. This was July 9th and since more late material was still needed from the mountain areas a route was chosen via Wauchecha Bald in Graham County, North Carolina, Robbinsville, a return to Wayah Bald via the Winding Steps road, a northern swing over Cowee Bald, memorable for dew-laden red azaleas and a brilliant sunrise over its cloud filled valleys, and thence to Highlands, North Carolina. The principal collections of this tour consisted of R. arborescens , late specimens of the red-orange Flame Azalea including an especially fine stoloniferous clone in full bloom near Nantahala Lake on July 10th, and R. viscosum , var. montanum , also in excellent bloom, pure white, in low thicket growth in open woods near Highlands. Occasional hybrids of this plant with the Sweet Azalea can be striking with their large pink flowers, as are similar hybrids with viscosum itself at lower elevations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PLUMLEAF AZALEA It being now the 12th of July a reference to the collecting map indicated that the late red azalea of Georgia, R. prunifolium , should be in flower. Its type locality is near Cuthbert in Randolph County, southwest Georgia, and in this direction the Chevrolet was turned from the hillsides, the rhododendron forests and the delightful climate of Highlands, North Carolina. The only detour made in crossing Georgia was in search of the Sweet Azalea at the southernmost part of its range in Upson County of central Georgia. The search consumed nearly a full day but the azalea was at last found in splendid quantity and, strangely enough, in full bloom in spite of this low elevation so far south. In pure white flower it followed the banks of a small Moccasin-infested tributary of the Flint River, the same azalea by all outward characteristics as its counterpart of 800 miles away in West Virginia. Fort Gaines, Georgia, is a sleepy little town on the banks of the Chattahoochie, the river separating Georgia and Alabama which, 75 miles farther south, joins the Flint River (from Upson County) to become the Appalachicola of northern Florida. Both Fort Gaines and Cuthbert, twenty miles northeast, are situated in a region where the clays of the rising Coastal Plain have been cut into deep gullies by small meandering streams. The sides are often so steep that the only access is by wading the stream, and one is almost forced to do this (in spite of the Water Moccasins) by the dense cat-briar tangles of the wooded surroundings. It is in these gullies of a few Georgia and Alabama counties, generally centering on Fort Gaines, that the Georgia late red azalea, R. prunifolium , is at home. Here, on steep slopes, wherever enough light has penetrated to permit flowering, it is found in round-topped bushes up to twelve feet high in reds, red-oranges, apricots and orange-yellows. The color range is not far different from that of the Cumberland Azalea and after seeing the latter for so long one is impressed by the similarity between the two. They both have those characteristic ridged flower tubes in the bud stage; they are both late, both red, and in more detailed morphology have little to show reason why they could not be quite logically and quite possibly regarded as high and low elevation derivatives from a common ancestor. By its lateness of bloom and geographic isolation R. prunifolium has not had the opportunity for recent gene exchange with other species. Thus it lacks the aggressive adaptability of its mountain counterpart, so that now, even in its chosen locale, young seedlings are seen so infrequently that one wonders how much longer it may persist without more effective protection than it now receives. The type locality for this species, 2 1/4 mi. N. E. of Cuthbert, is now a golf course with no azaleas evident but a good collection was made in a small ravine 1 1/4 miles distant. The visit to Fort Gaines also provided an opportunity to discuss mutual interests with that authority on southern azaleas, Mr. S. D. Coleman, who not only showed me his own unusual plants, so well tended and arranged, but who also provided a valuable lead to a curious little May-flowering white azalea of Central Georgia and Alabama, hitherto overlooked. The next day or so was spent in following this low growing plant, now past bloom, as far as Mississippi. On a basis of characteristics which lie somewhere between R. viscosum , serrulatum and oblongifolium , it has not yet been taxonomically assigned as a previously described entity and should certainly be credited to Mr. Coleman if a new designation is warranted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HAMMOCKSWEET Returning to Mississippi on a stifling 18th of July with the thermometer hovering around 104°F. the first plants of true R. serrulatum , the Hammocksweet Azalea, were found in flower the day following on the edge of a wooded swamp in Jones County.(Through the following week and a half, it was chased in equally good flower into southeastern Louisiana, east around the Gulf Coast to within a few miles of Lake Okeechobee in South Central Florida, back to its type collecting locality in Lake County, Florida, north again to the edges of the Okefenokee Swamp and again east to Folkston, Georgia, and the type locality of Rehder's R. serrulatum var. georgianum . Throughout this thousand miles and more the Hammocksweet Azalea showed no excessive variation. At times it is true that its leaves or dormant buds became more silky pubescent, its flower pedicels varied from pale green to deep red in color and its flowering season was obviously prolonged in lower Florida where single individuals may bloom from July to October or later, but essentially it remained the same sticky-tubed and rather inconspicuous little white azalea of the bog tussocks and the cypress islands of the southern waterways. At times it formed rounded bushes ten feet tall, but it was often low or producing but a few rangy stems seeking light through a dense cover of vine-covered holly or palmetto. The very late flowers of individual specimens could well be a characteristic worthy of exploitation in some future race of garden hybrids.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE NORTHWARD RETURN With good collections of R. serrulatum one could feel with fair satisfaction that the gamut of southern azaleas had been about run, until such time as return visits to puzzle areas might be called for in another year. A northward return was thus in order, so planned as to catch any further outliers of the R. serrulatum complex together with a fairly detailed survey of its northern counterpart, R. viscosum , which should now be in scattered bloom well into New England. Leaving Folkston on the 28th of July, our route headed towards Savannah and the Georgia side of the Savannah River where late azaleas had been observed during the R. speciosum season. The only collections this day were of fine specimens from a northerly distribution of Befaria racemosa , the curious ericaceous Tar Flower which, with its spikes of pink blossoms, is suggestive of a primitive azalea form. Here in coastal Georgia it grows on dry soils of the Pine-palmetto forest. Farther south the scattered clumps of this single North American representative of a Central and South American genus is a frequent sight along the Florida roadsides. Occasional Hammocksweet Azaleas were seen on the way to Savannah while, bypassing this city, the first low white azaleas resembling R. viscosum rather than R. serrulatum were found at a woodland edge in Effingham County. Farther along, in Screven County, there was found a swamp near Oliver where the swamp tussocks were covered with quite normal R. serrulatum , the swamp margins with a very variable dwarf and stoloniferous azalea, sometimes highly pubescent in its buds and leaves which was clearly much more akin to R. viscosum than the other species. On drier land an outer circle of R. canescens , past bloom, completed the azalea picture. This was the last collection of R. serrulatum , which does not seem to spread north of the Savannah River. It is clearly a region where the two late white azaleas meet and as such it is likely that gene exchange with resultant variability could be expected here in East Central Georgia. Crossing the Savannah River on Route U.S. 301, this road was followed north to Baltimore, as it parallels the coast some 100 miles inland. Throughout the distance of the Carolinas, Virginia and Maryland, R. viscosum was mass-collected, usually in good bloom, at intervals of approximately 60 miles. From Baltimore it was followed past Philadelphia into New Jersey, across New Jersey to Connecticut, and across Connecticut and Massachusetts to Cape Cod and even to the island of Martha's Vineyard where it was flowering on August 8th. This was another thousand mile run in which the variation of one species could be observed, step by step, until it became a fascination that terminated only as the last plants were collected. From the dwarf, twiggy and semi-evergreen bushes of the marshes of South Carolina to the tall, gray leaved and large flowered shrubs of the pond margins of Cape Cod, the Swamp Azalea is much more changeable than its sister of the Gulf Coast. Rehder has divided it into eight varieties and forms. One could make these many more, or less, depending upon the, viewpoint of the observer. It seems certain that not a little of the trouble is due to R. viscosum and arborescens having met on occasion in the northern states, as was strongly suggested by the last New York State and Pennsylvania collections on the return to Philadelphia. In some of these northern swamps genes have been so freely exchanged between these two species that nomenclatural assignment of present populations becomes virtually impossible. The situation is similar to that previously noted with regard to R. roseum and nudiflorum . But in spite of these local happenings, R. viscosum can still be regarded as “good” a species, though variable, as R. roseum , nudiflorum or serrulatum . This last run from central Pennsylvania to Philadelphia was on Sunday, August the 12th, and thus ended, after 21 weeks and 25,000 miles of almost continuous collecting, our quest for native azaleas. A few additional collections have since been made, as doubtless there will be others in the future. From this major field survey were secured 8,000 herbarium specimens and 500 living plants whose study should throw much new light upon the nature and the behavior of these plants. The herbarium specimens, now mounted and catalogued, are deposited in the herbarium of the Morris Arboretum of the University of Pennsylvania, at which institution the collection of living plants is also maintained for future observation and for their use in current cytological studies. * * Editor Note: Dr. Skinner also prepared, as a matter of record, a listing of herbarium and living collections. This is available in mimeographed form and will be furnished without cost, on request, to libraries, herbaria or individuals.</field>
