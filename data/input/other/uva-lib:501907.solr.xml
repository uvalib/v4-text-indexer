      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, March 17, 1951 Left Arboretum 3:30 p.m. Arrived Washington about 6:0 pm . Missed M. T. J[?] . Drove on to just N of Fredericksburg Va . Night in Cabin.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, March 18, 1951 Drove through to near Laurinburg N.C. Spring began at Richmond with tree breaking &amp; quince daffodils , the first crabapples etc. in flower. No further. Advance was noted right across N.C. until, approaching Durham , the grass suddenly became greener. Spasmodic rain</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, March 19, 1951 A good early start following routes 501, 175, 52, 17 (through Savannah ), 38 &amp; 301 to Nahunta for the night. Intermittent rain all morning and a steady downpour in the afternoon slowed progress &amp; finally eliminated chances of reaching Florida. The big thrill was the first yellow Jessamine gelsemium of South Carolina which eventually became very frequent. Wisteria is almost full in the Charleston region. Asiatic azaleas about half out. It is evidently a last season. No native azaleas as yet — and the search was not inviting towards the end of the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, March 20, 1951 Leaving Nahunta travelled by way of Folkstone Ga on Rt 1 to Jacksonville , then 228, 301 &amp; 24 to Gainesville for the night. First Azaleas were seen in bloom just across the Florida line at St. Marys River Plentiful from then on &amp; several singles &amp; 2 mass collections were made. Some variations in size of bloom &amp; amount of pink color but on the whole they are pretty uniform (canescens) . Plenty of snakes &amp; cat briers &amp; the swamps are very wet indeed with the recent rains. Mr Roberts of the Pathology Dept Univ of Fla showed me the Herbarium &amp; extended an invitation to an evening meeting where I saw Miss Lilia Arnold &amp; John Watkins . More rain tonight — also mosquitos in the daytime!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, March 21, 1951 Very wet morning spent with H. H. Hume discovering azaleas , Hollies etc. Saw a hedge of A. canescens at the Expt. Station also some interesting plants in his garden. In afternoon travelled via Route 24 244 etc. to Ocala ( Limestone quarries ) Moss Bluff to the whole length &amp; area of Ocala State Forest . Roads awful &amp; nearly got lost as well as out of gas. A high, dry area up to 900 ft above sea level. Not a smell of a wild azalea all day. Night in decent cabin near Starke</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, March 22, 1951 No luck with Azaleas in Bradford or Union Counties but found them in Baker on route 10 just after leaving 23, none in Columbia at Lake City but plenty (mass collection &amp; photographs) on a narrow sand road (136) just before striking the old bridge (which should fall down at any moment) over the Suwanee River at White Springs . After finding a cabin in this town took a run back to the river to collect a few more in Hamilton Co just off route 41. A perfect day. No clouds &amp; warms . Bees, bumble bees &amp; butterflies were very busy on the Azaleas . Just drying my feet after a log gave way dropping me knee deep into a stream.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, March 23, 1951 Breakfast at White Springs . Photographed Azaleas against the Suwanee River &amp; visited the new Stephen Foster museum — a very pleasing job. Travelled NE on US 41, S on U.S. 129; collected at the Suwanee river . Then to Live Oak . Mailed plants to M.A. &amp; on via F. 51, U.S. 27 to Perry , F 55 to Ga line &amp; a collection. No Azaleas to be seen at all in Suwanee , Lafayette or Taylor cos in spite of many apparently ideal locations. In the state boundary region they reappeared very conspicuously with dogwoods on crossing the fall line. The dogwoods stopped exactly with the drop in ground level. One collection in Madison Co on a dirt road E from Ashville . Retraced steps &amp; followed 146 to Monticello for the night. Saw Azaleas just outside Monticello but did not collect. It is becoming evident that the Florida occurrence is in very localized pockets which are often widely separated. If they are not seen from the main roads there seems little use in extensive search as was made on the southern loop of the Suwanee R in Suwanee Co . Again the situation seemed ideal but they were not there. It is perhaps generally a little drier than the Ga boundary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, March 24, 1951 Azaleas abundant in Georgia — travelled on U.S 19 to Thomasville , Ga collecting just N of Monticello , in Thomas Co &amp; in a woodland abundance W of Thomasville on U.S. 84. All apparently pure A. canescens . Took 111 S out of Cairo &amp; U.S. 27 &amp; 90 to Quincy . Mass collect S of Quincy on 287 including a pure white &amp; good pinks. Packed plants and retraced to Quincy to mail them but the P.O. was closed. Headed to Tallahassie for the night. Rather poor cabin &amp; poor meal for an Easter evening!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, March 25, 1951 Left Tallahassie via Fla 20 to dirt rd. S just beyond Bloxham . Azaleas abundant in Leon &amp; Wakulla Cos even down to Sopchoppy . None, however along coast or up length of Franklin Co on rd thru High Bluff &amp; Fort Gadsden — except for serrulation in the Cypress sinks . It is evident that Canescens follows the pine hills but seldom gets in the flat woods of which Franklin &amp; Gulf Cos wholly consist. Via U.S. 98 &amp; Fla 71 &amp; 73 returned to Marianna for the night, collecting in Calhoun Co on the way. Passed up plenty in Jackson Co. Fine day &amp; good cabin for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, March 26, 1951 From Mariana travelled on U.S. 231 N , turned off to Slocomb ( Geneva Co Ala ) then on 12 to Geneva where found the first austrinum in some beautiful yellow &amp; tawny colors. S.E. on Fla 185 found a large batch of austrinum &amp; mass collected &amp; secured plants. Ivory shades suggested a canescens intermixture. The golden yellows looked just like pontica or flavum . Ended in getting only as far as De Funiak for the night instead of to the end of Florida as planned.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, March 27, 1951 Leaving De Funiak Springs took 187 to Gordon &amp; Florala in Alabama . Returned into Florida on 85, then cutting over Route 2 &amp; down to Baker &amp; Crestview for lunch. The Yellow River lived up to its name being lined with masses of austrinum which I collected fairly heavily. The high point, however where the still greater quantities of Canescens just before reaching the Yellow River . Surely no other spot has so many Azaleas ! Noted, collected &amp; photographed some interesting pale yellows among pinks — evidently F 1 s of canescens x austrinum . These were again seen in the afternoon in the Blackwater Forest . The afternoon ride was via Route 4 to Century &amp; to Atmore, Ala. for the night. Made good in all the last Florida counties Now for Louisiana!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, March 28, 1951 Very little collecting today — chiefly had trouble in getting off an express package of plants. Finally had to dig up a quarantine inspector in Mobile &amp; sent the plants from Pascagoula . This was travelling by way of route 31 from Atmore to Mobile (nearly washed off the narrow sea pass to Mobile with a strong south wind blowing) then, in general, go to beyond Pascagoula for the night. Spent quite a bit of the afternoon at Bellingrath Gardens which were well worth seeing. Here got the tip concerning good looking yellow Azaleas in Jackson Co , Miss. which will be my first quest in the morning. M r Hunt , the superintendent was very helpful at Bellingrath .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, March 29, 1951 Terrific downpour of rain during the night. The gravel road to Van Cleave was half flooded. Inquiring in that town found yellow Azaleas growing on the "river road" where I eventually found a considerable number — all much like those of Alabama . Collected canescens in Jackson, George, Stone, Pearl River &amp; Hancock Counties travelling by devious poor roads through Whittier Crossing , Wiggins , Silver Run , Necaise , McNeill , Picayune amp; so to New Orleans for the night including supper at Brousseau's in the French Quarter .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, March 30, 1951 Discovered loss of my gasoline credit card &amp; telegraphed the station at Van Cleave &amp; have it sent on to Silsbee, Texas . Hope it turns up! Ran back into New Orleans for one or two pictures of the old town — then on via U.S. 61 to Baton Rouge . Claire Brown of the Botany Dept att the State University was away for the day. Their herbarium is poor. On via U.S. 190 with sundry deviations via Melville , Lebeau to Opelousas &amp; Eunice , Chataignier &amp; Mamou to Basile but no Azaleas . This country is bad — very flat &amp; when not swampy is cultivated or closely grazed. Proper situations seem just non existent . The change came, however, at the E branch of the Calcasieu River when the first small hills appeared &amp;, almost immediately afterwards, Azaleas . Am at De Quincy for the night but intend retracing a bi in the morning to collect at least in Beauregard Co where they must be abundant. A cool night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, March 31, 1951 Backtracked a little from De Quincy to collect in the local parishes — then headed on La 7 for Beaumont &amp; Silsbee . Azaleas in vast profusion right across the Sabine river . Collected in several counties nearby including a mass in Hardin . They are not the same canescens as those of Alabama . Much more glandular &amp; one white had a faint yellow spot which sent me back to the Sabine R. to search for austrinum . But no luck &amp; and no one seems to have heard of a yellow in Texas . Also no luck with the credit card as yet. We'll try for some more evertorly collecting tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, April 1, 1951 Good hot day. Took Tex. 787 from Kontze making a circle by way of Saratoga , Votaw , Cleveland , Cornoe , Huntsville , Livingston , Woodville &amp; down U.S. 69. Plenty of Azaleas in Hardin Co especially in the "Big Thicket," but the Trinity river has a broad flat valley &amp; and beyond the county is much drier — probably too dry. Best mass collection was at Livingston . Still no luck on the credit card.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, April 2, 1951 Not much accomplished today. Collected plants in the "Big Thicket" this morning. This after failed at P.O. so got the car greased &amp; drove via route 287 to Crockett for the night to try &amp; collect at the type locality — Grapeland — tomorrow. Saw no Azaleas beyond Polk Tyler Co. It feels very dry up this way — almost the Black Prairie type of county but it may change quickly to the north. I don't like so much spanish moss around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, April 3, 1951 Plenty of Azaleas as Grapeland but with no leaves &amp; in tight bud — evidently quite different to the canescens complex collected so far. Will try &amp; return sometime in May when they should be open. Ran up to the Texas Expr. Sta at Tyler but found it a small outfit — very diverse &amp; with Yarnell moved to S.C. Did not stay long. No herbarium — it being at A &amp; M at Bryant . The rose are all grown by small farmers in small cultivated lots in otherwise quite heavily wooded country — again not as expected. Taking routes 69 &amp; 63 for Zavalia , returned to Jasper for the night. Good Azaleas &amp; a mass collection in Angelina &amp; Jasper counties .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, April 4, 1951 Not having azalea records from Augustine &amp; Sabine Counties &amp; feeling sure that there must be plenty; ran fast up U.S. 96 to Brookland &amp; collect in both. They are there in quantity &amp; probably extend much farther north in Texas . Retracing steps to Jasper , took route to Newton &amp; Alexandria via La 21. Newton County also has an abundance of Azaleas , as does Vernon in Louisiana . Made meagre collections only, including some Taxodium at the Sabine river . A mass collection some 12 mi out of Alexandria in Route 21. About the same in variation and appearance as in Texas . All collected a few plants to check on later. Will not be surprised if the western population turns out to be largely tetraploid. Flowers especially are quite large. At Alexandria for the night. A very pleasant city.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, April 5, 1951 A quite productive day. With slight detour, followed Us 167 from Alexandria, La to El Dorado, Ark , collecting in all counties passed through (7) &amp; making 2 mass collections. The Canescens complex is common the whole way — in the moist stream bottom localities in which one would expect to find it. Also secured a plant of the deepest pink yet seen — plus one or two others for later analysis. The degree of variation seems to remain much about the same with flowers still generally larger than those east of the Mississippi . Have not run into the true oblongifolium mass since Grapeland, Tex. Will attempt one more mass near Little Rock before heading back into Mississippi .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, April 6, 1951 The mass collection near Sheridan, Ark. did not materialize. One meagre sampling in Calhoun Co marked the last Azaleas seen through the whole day. It is probable that this phase tends to run out somewhere in this region. The dogwood was just as far advanced so they could have been unopened but several excursions into the wood were fruitless in turning up plants. Headed S.E. on U.S. 270 for Sheridan , crossing the Mississippi on U.S. 82 at Greenville , continuing to Winona &amp; then south on U.S. 51 almost into Jackson — a distance of 393 miles for the day Unfortunately the route chosen followed &amp; crossed the main river valleys most of the way. In such valleys where Cypress grows, the soil is gray &amp; possibly alkaline. No conifers &amp; no dogwood is present — which indicated it's almost certain absence of azaleas &amp; this is probably true for the entire Mississippi Valley. Why they do not seem obvious in Central Mississippi is somewhat of a mystery. They should fit among the red pine covered hills. The land however has been nearly completely ravished by poor farming. Expect to find them around them around Jackson tomorrow morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, April 7, 1951 Took a run to Scott Co &amp; collected. Also slid off the very wet dirt road &amp; had to get towed out. Saw Azaleas in Rankin Co but hoped for better &amp; passed them up. They are few &amp; far between up this way. Returned to Jackson &amp; took U.S. 51 south to Brookhaven , then east on U.S. 84, collecting along the way in most counties to Laurel for the night. There should be Azaleas everywhere but the land is so badly burned &amp; farmed that few natural woodlots are left. Even so the digable streams do not have the population that they do in Louisiana .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, April 8, 1951 Did not make much mileage but collected in practically every county on U.S. 84 between Waynesboro &amp; Andalusia, Ala. All canescens type except for a single yellow in Covington Co. The canescens is getting a little by but shows considerable variation between early &amp; late forms among those growing together. A beautiful day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, April 9, 1951 Did not make as much progress as hoped for but made some good collections. Travelled via U.S. 29 to Brantley, Ala , Ala 52 to Elba , packed the plants for the Arboretum &amp; expressed them with specimens at Troy ( Ala. 15) Took 231 &amp; Ala 10 to Abbeville but couldn't find a cabin &amp; had to go 30 mi S. to Dothan for the night. High spots of the day included another hybrid swarm of Austrinum x canescens , the first alabamense with it's delightful scent &amp; an amazing swarm of apparently austrinum canescens alabamense . Should have take photographs but the light was too bad. Loaded down with more plants again. How do the species keep separate when they hybridize so much &amp; so easily???</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, April 10, 1951 From Dothan by way of Ala. 52, Ga 62 &amp; 91 to Camilla Ga to gather mail then on as far as Moultrie for the night. Baker Co. falls very much in the dry Dougherty Plain area &amp; has few Azaleas.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, April 11, 1951 From Moultrie via U.S. 319 to Ocilla then Ga 32 to Patterson amp; 38 to Jessup for the night. Made one mass collection but the pickings were poor in the last few counties. Apparently these dry sandy upland terrace areas ( Bacon, Pearce &amp; Wayne Counties ) have very little besides serrulatum in the swamps. A lovely cabin for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, April 12, 1951 It started off promising to rain but fortunately cleared as the day went on. Needed a mass collection in Wayne Co but so far had drawn a blank. Taking U.S. 301 explored the Altamaha river bluffs but again no luck. Was impressed however with the density of vegetation &amp; noting that the Franklinia territory ( Fort Barrington )was not far away decided to have a little side Franklinia hunt on the opposite side of the river. Accordingly drove back to Jessup &amp; down U.S. 341 to Grangerville ^ (12 mi ) where a dirt road was found leading back to the river. About a mile from the river Azalea canescens suddenly appeared &amp; increased until the river bluffs were simply smothered with it. The mass collection was no problem! Colors were puden wildly in shades of light to very dark pink — only relatively few approaching white. Worked the river jungle for an hour or so but no sign of Franklinia . Most anything, however, could be in there. Returning to Jessup took U.S. 341 to McRae for the night. No Azaleas evident of the typical coastal plain until a change in contour developed at Hazlehurst . Evidently these plants do not like the plain proper &amp; follow into it only down the broader river valleys where it is cooler &amp; moister. For some reason Telfair Co does not yet seem promising for another mass collection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, April 13, 1951 Traveled today from McRae via Ga 27, 26 &amp; U.S. 103 to the outskirts of Phenix City, Ala. Had no luck in Telfair Co. but by dint of some search made out pretty well in the next 3 counties including a "mass" in Pulaski . After that, however, was a complete blank. With part of Macon &amp; Schley counties we again ran out onto those damnable red hills which are rather dry but nonetheless support blueberries , leucothe , dogwood &amp; fringe tree ^ &amp; oceanside kalmia but for some obscure reason absolutely no azaleas — and this was not for lack of searching! It is to be hoped that the "Black Belt" tomorrow will be a little more productive!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, April 14, 1951 From Phenix City via U.S. 80 to Montgomery then on US 31 to Greenville for the night. Was fairly successful in collections including one mass, except for Montgomery Co. Until getting into Butler , however, they have required a a great deal of searching for. They are undoubtedly in all of these counties but we are still very much in the "red hill" locality &amp; azaleas seem to settle in only the most favored spots. Being Saturday I missed the bus in trying to get off a shipment of plants. Could not get a certificate. The best cabin yet for the night!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, April 15, 1951 A hot day &amp; a rather disappointing one from the azalea standpoint. Route: From Greenville S on U.S. 31 Georgiana , 106 to Midway , 47 to Awin 10 &amp; 28 via Camden to Linden , 43 to Eutaw , 40 to Aliceville 17, 71 &amp; 14 to Macon (&amp; several side excursions on dirt roads) 45 to Columbus for the night. Found a lone alabamense in Butler Co but practically nothing from Monroe Co. on. Wilcox is part Red Hills which is poor but also started the Black Belt area which has so far extended all the way to Columbus . This is essentially loam on limestone &amp; the valleys are thickly Red Cedar populated the whole way. Only the higher ridges offer possibilities for Azaleas &amp; one such was struck in Greene Co. Others were searched but to no avail. Azaleas are present but very much scattered</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, April 16, 1951 Across the river from Columbus, Miss. within 2 miles ran into Azaleas with the start of the hills. With a few breaks was with them most of the day. They are a very different Azalea to those of the south — the color of canescens but with more whites, often with yellow blotches &amp; scent. The whole lot must be surely referable to alabamense but how different to the white alabamense of the south! Route: U.S. 45 &amp; Miss to Amory . 25 blocked the rest of the way so took Miss 41 to U.S. 45 &amp; on to Tupelo , then U.S. 78 to Hamilton, Ala , &amp; U.S. 43 till it joined Ala 18 in Fayette Co. Traveled 18 to Jasper for the night. Azaleas are relatively abundant in Fayette &amp; Marion Cos. With Walker one has finally left the coastal plain for the first really sharp hills. Azaleas occur spottily. Will collect for the county tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, April 17, 1951 Route: Jasper , Ala N to Double Springs , 112 to Cullman 112 to Baileyton , S to Holly Pond , W on 128 to Cullman , S on 69, back to Cullman &amp; 8 mi S on U.S. 31 for the night. Collected a rather curious mass in Winston Co &amp; searched all Cullman for type locality specimens of alabamense . Finally found them way on a hill top south of town. The first time a whole day has been spent in one county! But feel the reward was worth while. It is distinct altho it obviously breeds freely with canescens . Will try for the same thing in Marshall Co. tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, April 18, 1951 Route: many dirt roads today in a rather unrewarding search for alabamense . From Cullman U.S. 31 S to Garden City then macadam rd E across a long covered bridge &amp; a dirt rd "vertically" up the mountain side. A poor ride on very bad track over the mountain then North in the next valley &amp; back to the macadam rd to Blountsville . N. on Ala 38 to U.S. 112, E to Guntersville &amp; S on U.S. 241 to Glencoe for the night. Found alabamense in tight bud on hill near Warrenton , overlooking the T.V. Lake. Much alabamense in the canescens around Glencoe but no actual plants seen It is 2 — 3 weeks too early to catch very much. Hope for better luck a few counties south. P.S. alabamense of Warrenton is e glandular except for the corolla tube, that of Cullman Co was entirely glandular, even to the petiole &amp; leaf blades! It almost looks as if the true center for the species is even west of Cullman Co , particularly since so many whites were showing up even in Mississippi</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, April 19, 1951 Not much territory covered today — Glencoe to Talladega via U.S. 241, with a 10 mile side trip to Kentuck Fire Tower just west of Mt. Chiha ^Cheaha ( Alt. 2402 ft ) But it was a filthy morning &amp; a drenching downpour from ceaseless thunderstorms which had been busy all throughout the night so that minor floods were everywhere by daybreak. Made use of the occasion to settle down in a barn &amp; pack an overdue shipment of plants which were compressed (with 1 box of specimens)from Anniston . The afternoon search in the hills was for alabamense of which no trace was seen — not even whites among the canescens of the region. Will try again tomorrow. Recd. telegram at Talladega frm Jim Nicholls so will head toward Atlanta to meet him tomorrow evening at a hotel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, April 20, 1951 Route: Ala 48 to Wedowee , 37 to Roanoke ,, 63 &amp; Ga 34 to Newnan Ga 16 to Fayetteville , Ga 97 &amp; U.S. 29 to Atlanta . Good collecting most of the way &amp; saw the first speciosum just outside of Nenman but it was more or less on private property &amp; I did not stop for it. Arrived at Atlanta about 6.0 P.M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, April 21, 1951 A second day in Atlanta . Nicholls did not arrive until evening. Will see him for a while tomorrow. Unsuccessful shopping trip in the morning for new corrugated driers. Also had to buy a new tube for a dead tire on the truck. In afternoon ran up to Marietta for a pleasant visit with W.P. Lemmon . He is somewhat screwy in his azalea ideas but is keen &amp; a pleasure to talk to. On the way back to Atlanta was able to pull in a mass collection of speciosum — canescens forms — evidently interbreeding just as much as the rest. Speciosum is a brilliant orange-scarlet. Want to see more of it tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, April 22, 1951 Breakfast &amp; a long talk with Nicholls &amp; Mrs Hayden so did not leave Atlanta much before 11.0 A.M. Travelled by way of U.S. 78 to Monroe , Ga 11 to Monticello (with a few side trips on dirt roads to bring in the counties but found no cabin at Monticello . Retraced over Ga 16 to Jackson but there they were full. Finally wound up at an exceedingly pleasant spot at Indian Springs on U.S. 41. Collected Speciosum today &amp; expect plenty again tomorrow. Ran through intermittent showers all day &amp; have rain again tonight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, April 23, 1951 Route: Indian Springs to Jackson , then Ga 16 via Monticello &amp; Sparta to a dirt rd N of Warthen . E &amp; S via Deepstep to Ga 24 &amp; Louisville for the night. Various other dirt rd side excursions up Jackson Lake etc in search of Speciosum . Saw none, however all day. With the exception of a 10 mi stretch S. of Sparta &amp; around Sandersville most of the time was on red clay hills &amp; azaleas were scarce. Directly the yellow sandy phase appeared they became plentiful. Some canescens , however, collected in most counties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, April 24, 1951 Route: Louiseville &amp; Wrens &amp; Thompson via U.S. 1 &amp; Ga 17. To Augusta via U.S. 78 with detour at Harlem up into Columbia Co. Dirt rd. cross cuts to Ga 56 at Augusta &amp; unfruitful searches along the river at the airport &amp; above for speciosum . Did not find high enough bluffs. Via 56 with good speciosum collecting near McBean . Out to Waynesboro &amp; since no cabins on to Sylvania for the night. Plenty of canescens all the way tho it is getting past bloom in this section.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, April 25, 1951 Route: Cross cut from Sylvania to Ga. 24. Searched the river in this region but too flat. Retraced to Stoney Bluff but bluffs to shallow &amp; too heavily wooded. Retraced for a late ( 2.30 ) lunch in Sylvania . Ga 21 to Newington &amp; back to Ga 24. After much questioning of natives decided to try Hudson's Ferry &amp; up the river a way eventually found speciosum again. Intended to visit Clyo but the road mistakenly led me back to Ga 21 so came on to Springfield for the night. Speciosum is plentiful where it happens to occur which in this region is always, apparently on the steep red clay bluffs facing N. or N.E. Very different to its sunny positions on flat ground around Atlanta .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, April 26, 1951 In the morning went via Ga to Clyo &amp; too dirt rd in to Sisters Ferry . Quite abandoned &amp; road to ferry proper is entirely overgrown. An old boy working on the farm which owns it told me that he gave up the last ferry there about 30 years ago. Gathered specimens &amp; plant from an orange " speciosum " near the top of the glen leading to the ferry — probably off the actual plants M r. Lemon told me of &amp; which might well be descendants of those of Michaux's time. Follow the bluff down river &amp; made a mass collection of fairly typical speciosum (though mostly a bit on the orange side) 1/2 a mile away. Getting past their bloom so it was not easy to find reasonably good specimens. In afternoon packed plants &amp; specimens &amp; visited with M rs. Wilcox ? of the Casa Hotel with M r. &amp; M rs. Reed to seed transplanted speciosum at their place. A very nice show. Second night at Springfield.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, April 27, 1951 Mailed in compressed plants &amp; specimens at Savannah . Purchased labels &amp; in afternoon drove via U.S. 17 &amp; S.C. 170 to Bluffton for atlanticius . Was given a bad steer by a Miss Martin &amp; ended up at Ridgeland with nothing . Took U.S. 21 to Beaufort &amp; after enquiry at a Florist Shop took a road S.W. out of Burton &amp; cut over toward the rivers edge. In oak woods found plenty of beautifully pink atlanticius . Very vivid but non glandular shoots &amp; leaves. Just at the height of its bloom. Night at a cabin near Beaufort .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, April 28, 1951 Route: Circled Parris Island , then U.S. 21 &amp; 17 to S.C. 61 just outside of Charleston , to Summerville &amp; U.S. 176 ( S.C. 31) to Columbia . A few minor detours along the way but had a successful day in collecting atlanticius frm Beaufort Co to Calhoun Co with 3 mass collections and several canescens besides. Visited a few minutes with the Hankinsons in Columbia .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, April 29, 1951 Until the last half hour a singularly fruitless day! Route: U.S. 76 N.W. for Columbia with detour to Ballentine via Irmo , 76 &amp; 276 to Greenville (with Sunday side excursions). U.S. 29 to Greer &amp; S.C. s 101, 146, 92, &amp; 9 via Woodruff , Cross Keys , &amp; Lockhart to Chester . No cabin so 321 to Winnsboro . No cabin, so 213 via Ridgeway to Camden &amp; all set for the night. All day was on the red clay hills &amp; not a sign of a azalea was to be seen — in or out of bloom until just past Ridgeway when first sand hills of the coastal plain appeared — an azaleas too. Unfortunately it was past 7.0 pm &amp; nearly dark but got a fair representation of canescens . The red hills carry red cedar all the way and test pH 7.0 — probably the explanation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, April 30, 1951 Route: To Camden , then S.C. 34, 341 &amp; 309 via Bishopville , Lynchburg to Lake City . U.S. 52 to Kingstree &amp; S.C. 377 &amp; U.S. 571 to Georgetown for the night. Two side tracks to the Lynchburg River &amp; sundry other, usually rather fruitless excursions along dirt roads. Collecting was pretty good. A surprising amount of canescens still in flower as well as mass collections of atlanticum busily hybridizing with it. Have not yet found what would be called a "pure" stand of atlanticum — perhaps farther up the coast? Some of the hybrids, however are large flowered &amp; very pleasing from the ornamental standpoint.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, May 1, 1951 Route 17 to Wilmington with no detours but a lot of collecting — chiefly of atlanticum which gets thicker &amp; thicker but also too lots of canescens — one in Brunswick Co , N.C. Atlanticum is very mixed&gt; — so far as colors are concerned &amp; is obvious intergrading with canescens a great deal.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, May 2, 1951 Route: US 74 west to N.C. 87 via Fayetteville / or rather S on N.C. 20 because of a detour), from Raeford 211 to Aberdeen , U.S. 1 &amp; 501 via Sanford to Chapel Hill, N.C. 54 &amp; U.S. 70 to Raleigh for the night with the Clarksons . Pretty good collecting. The Bladen Co canescens proved to the half nudiflorum &amp; Moore Co entirely nudiflorum so so the dividing line evidently comes right in the region. Did not find atlanticum around Chapel Hill . It seems rather high, dry &amp; red for the species.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, May 3, 1951 Route: U.S. 70 Raleigh to Kingston , N.C. 55 to Ft. Barnwell &amp; cut overs to Vanceboro . Night just beyond Wilmar . Route 70 proved a bad one for collecting — too much tobacco country. The last part, however, was good, with atlanticum in great profusion in the flat pine lands. Was not successful in finding any nudiflorum during the day. Picked up new shipping tags at Dept of Agr. in Raleigh in the morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, May 4, 1951 Route 17 from Chocowinity — U.S. 17 to Windsor , N.C. 97 &amp; Va 37 to Suffolk, Va , Va 10 &amp; U.S. 17 &amp; Va 108 via Newport News &amp; just beyond Williamsburg for the night. Collecting most mixed masses of the atlanticum complex — very involved in color throughout the whole region but getting much more glandular as we go north. One only found — very deep very pink &amp; obviously a pink contributor to atlanticum .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, May 5, 1951 Route: Va 30, 33 &amp; 198 to Mathews in Matthews Co , return by Va 14 via Adner , King &amp; Queen Courthouse &amp; Sparta to Bowling Green for the night. Nudiflorum was plentiful all the way, especially in the narrow dips in the sand hills of King &amp; Queen Co. The tour around the cape was for atlanticum but absolutely none was found although the terrain around Matthews seemed entirely suitable. Coastal plains proper, however only really touches the extreme ends of those points. Atl. ceased the day before very soon above Hampton . But strangely one small stand (the only one during the day) cropped up near King &amp; Queen Courthouse where it must presumably somehow follow up the river. It was on a hillside &amp; scarcely in the locality one would expect to find it. Nudiflorum is very pink.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, May 6, 1951 Route: from Bowling Green Va 2, 606 to Paytes , retrace to Snell , back same route &amp; Va 20, to Orange , U.S. 15 &amp; Va 230 to Madison , 231 to Sperryville for the night. Plenty of nudiflorum all the way — partly glandular. It seems to do well on the red soils of the region but they are moister and seem more fertile than those of Ga &amp; South Carolina . In bloom to about 1600 ft on the Blue Ridge — for tomorrow's collecting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, May 7, 1951 Drove to Luray &amp; visited with Favor of the Park, discussing the time to revisit (about may 25). Collected nudiflorum to 1600 ft above Sperryville but no more was open. Took the Skyline Drive(this still quite dormant) to U.S. 33 to Gordonsville &amp; 15 to Farmville for the night. Plenty of nudiflorum until the last two counties when the clay got redder &amp; they seem to fade out as farther south. Headed now for Alabama .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, May 8, 1951 Packed specimens &amp; plants &amp; shipped 2 boxes &amp; 1 bundle from Danville Va in the afternoon. Travelled via U.S. 15 &amp; Va 36 to Danville , then U.S. 29 to G olds reens boro, N.C. for the night. 2 mass collections of nudiflorum &amp; several odd specimens. They thin out very considerably in lower Virginia . The mass collection at Gold Greensboro tonight was a surprise. The situation in flat scrub oak woodland is not where one would expect to find them — particularly in such quantity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, May 9, 1951 Route: Intaded following U.S. 29 to Anderson, S.C. but the tours &amp; traffic lights are too thick. Turned off onto 120 at Salisbury &amp; followed it around via Shelby to 29 again at Gaffney . Collected mail at Anderson &amp; stayed the night. Collecting was spotty the red hill district — so azaleas only in favorable locations — which is always along streams, usually on a N. slope and only on some streams at that. However made 2 mass collections — with none between — both needed considerable searching &amp; many other searches were fruitless. It is not helped by the fact that nudiflorum is about past bloom in the area. The best spot was Broad river where a wealth of ericaceous material covered the river deposit sand banks on the S. side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, May 10, 1951 Leaving Anderson bright &amp; early cut straight into the county, met a farmer &amp; was promptly led of a mass collection of canescens — all past bloom. Travelling on U.S. 29 &amp; on to Athens, collecting once along the way, &amp; stopped at the university. D r. Duncan was on a field trip but was shown the herbarium by a M r. Jacobs . Very few azaleas — but perhaps worth getting later. Taking U.S. 129 via Gainesville travelled to Junction of U.S. 19 in Lumpkin Co for the night — among the mountains. A collection just outside Gainesville was interesting for one spectacular red among the other salmon &amp; orange calendulaceums — almost as if speciosum was having some influence up this way. Subsequent collections run more to the yellow-orange. Calendulaceum is becoming really plentiful from White Co on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, May 11, 1951 Route: Left on U.S. 19 to 60 north over Woody Gap (in Lumpkin Co , then right on 180 around Lake Winfield Scott &amp; through Vogel State Park to U.S. 129 again. Took a dirt rd to a defunct construction camp just S. of Vogel Park (for the " furbishii " complex) the south on 129 via Neel Gap (border of Lumpkin &amp; Union Co's , S. on U.S. 19 to Dawsonville &amp; W. on Ga 53 to Calhoun for the night. Most calendulaceums that around the Neel Gap region were definite on the red-orange side &amp; there seems to be all that " Bakeri " * represents in Vogel State Park . Furbishii is absolutely no different * (see notes in record book). Finally pulled in one more mass collection of canescens , still in fair flower, in Dawson Co. No further azaleas seen. Was disappointed in not finding calendulaceum in this region as a possible red stepping stone to the speciosum of Atlanta . *Evidently did not find the right plants!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, May 12, 1951 A through run from Calhoun on Ga 53 to Rome , 20 to Leesburg, Ala , 68 to Albertville , &amp; 241 &amp; Ala 112 to Cullman for the night. Beautyrest Cabins on U.S. 31 as before Hit one lot of canescens in Cherokee Co. , &amp; found the two lots of alabamense tho rather past bloom, still carrying sufficient flowers to serve the purpose. They definitely like shady spots on the north side of hills — seem to prefer more shade than canescens — or at least in just these two spots. Still want to find a pure stand if possible — tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, May 13, 1951 A very strenuous day. Back to station on Ala 69. Then over a long dirt road via Trade to Arley to Addison . Ala 112 &amp; 5 to Russellville for the night. Finally found plenty of alabamense — at least the canescens phase — in completely full bloom. Winston Co. is certainly the center. On 122 &amp; the Sipsey river the hills are covered as far as you can see. None here, though of this low &amp; very glandular form. A few plants only in Cullman Co. Some day should try &amp; find this, as it must be, in quantity somewhere by itself. Arrived at Russellville (the nearest cabins) very late &amp; did not get to bed until nearly midnight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, May 14, 1951 Retraced to a mountain slope S. of Russellville . Found a hybrid complex but not true alabamense . Hit the same mtn 10 mi E of Russellville on Ala 24 but it was dry slope &amp; found no azaleas . (They are in enormous quantities at the first stop). Retraced to R. &amp; took U.S. 43 north to Lawrenceburg, Tenn , &amp; U.S. 64 E to Monteagle for the night. Much of the travel in Tennessee was over red soil land with limestone outcrops &amp; lots of black locust &amp; cedar . No azaleas until hitting a sphagnum swamp (fairly high) E. of Fayetteville . Then no more in cedar territory until the road climbed the mountain to monteagle . The base of this mountain is limestone but it is evidently overlaid with sandstone &amp; on this the azaleas occur again in great abundance &amp; also diversity . It superficially seems that this may be a spot where the influence of canescens , alabamense &amp; nudiflorum all meet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, May 15, 1951 Route: Ten. 56 from Monteagle to Altamont , then 108 to McMinnvill . U.S. 708 to Crossville for the night (Rainbow Cabins — O.K.). The alabamense — canescens complex attained great profusion in the hills from Tracy City to beyond Altamont &amp; the drop to the red soil — cedar valley which extends to around Sparta . It was rather conspicuous that alabamense has imparted a hill loving caracter to canescens — also that the white of alabamense is the most pronounced in the highest places. The valley around McMinnville has something approaching nudiflorum in localized spots — chiefly in the sphagnum swamps when they can be found. Nud. becomes apparently truer on the plateau proper towards Crossville — still, however, in the wet places.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, May 16, 1951 Route: Tenn 68 to Grassy Cove , retrace &amp; S. on Tenn 28 to Pikeville . To top of West Mountain , retrace &amp; E over mountain on Tenn 30 to Athens for the night. Grassy Cove is an interesting formation with its river sink finally reappearing from through the mountain as the Sequatchie river . Tried to concentrate on getting a fair picture today of the canescens canescens-alabamense &amp; nudiflorum complexes in the mountain region. They are very mixed but the picture seems fairly straight now. But delayed too long for I had hoped to reach Murphy tonight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, May 17, 1951 Route . Tenn 30 via Etowah to U.S. 64 to Murphy and Andrews, N.C. Gravel road via Aquone to top of Wayah Bald . Down to Franklin &amp; over Ocoee Gap towards Sylva for the night. Besides one collection of canescens type in Cherokee Natl Forest , nearly past bloom, no other early azaleas were seen. Calendulaceum appeared soon after crossing the N.C. line &amp; has been present in comparative abundance on the lower slopes. Most of the azaleas of Wayah Bald are evidently arborescens type &amp; will not be in flower until sometime next month. Missed Nicholls &amp; M rs Hayden at Murphy but obtained some useful information at the Nantahala Forest headquarters at Franklin . A rather hot day but cooled by a little rain this evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, May 18, 1951 Route: To Asheville via U.S. 19A &amp; 19, with one mass collection of calendulaceum along the way. To rather beyond Bristol, Va for the night via U.S. 19 &amp; 11. Stopped at Biltmore in the early afternoon &amp; had a grand time with Sylvester Owens &amp; the azaleas — by far the best collection of native material in existence! Particularly interested in Furbishii — which does not represent my own collection. The remainder is pretty much the hybrid mess that I have been seeing all along the way. A M rs Shelton is being groomed to take over Beadle's work. The rest of the way yielded no collections — partly due to very heavy thunderstorms in the mountains &amp; by reason of the fact that none were seen beyond 2 calendulaceum in Unicoi Co , Tenn — &amp; not collected. Will hope for better luck tomorrow but at the same time would like to reach the Eastern Shore, boa with all speed!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, May 19, 1951 Route: Us 11 to Abington , 58 to Damascus &amp; on over dirt rd via Konnarock back to Chilhowie . U.S 11 to Dublin , Va 100 to Pearisburg &amp; US 460 to Christiansburg . US 11 to Salem for the night. Very roundabout — chiefly in a search for a diploid yellow calendulaceum . No luck so far; It is perhaps a week early in this section. Ran into roseum &amp; nudiflorum with hybrids between both &amp; between both &amp; calendulaceum . Where do such things stop??</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, May 20, 1951 Over mountain east of Salem &amp; back to Roanoke via U.S. 221. U.S. 11 to Buchanan &amp; Va 43 to Peaks of Otter . Dirt rd across the James River back to U.S 11 &amp; to beyond. Natural Bridge for the night. A few calendulaceum near Roanoke but got a good transect down Mt Broad Top from roseum into nudiflorum . Quite a hike up the mountain! Took 5 hrs to run the transect! Philadelphia gets later &amp; later. Roseum is very glandular on the top of the mountain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, May 21, 1951 Route: U.S. 11 to Newmarket , 211 via Luray &amp; Skyline drive to Washington , U.S. 50 to Annapolis . Obtain maps, park key &amp; advice from naturalist Paul Favor at Luray Park Headquarters &amp; proceeded to scout Best Places for an East side mountain transect. The Red Gate road was not too promising &amp; finally settled on a run from the Pinnacles down. Collected at 3800 ft but plants only in bud. Took a fire road down to 2400 ft &amp; made 2 collections — not very satisfactory. Will have to return in a week &amp; finish the job. Tried to reach M.T. Forser in Washington (left the Skyline drive at 6.0 pm) but found him in California . No place to stay between Washington &amp; Annapolis . Pretty darn tired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, May 22, 1951 Route: Ferry to Eastern Shore then U.S. 50 to Easton , Md 331 to Choptank, 319 &amp; 18 to Lewes &amp; Rehoboth Beach , Del 14 to Milford , U.S. 113 to Frederica &amp; 12 to Sandtown , 10 &amp; U.S. 13 to Philadelphia . Aside from a small collection of atlanticum at Milford . Spent most of the day until 4.30 searching for Choptank Mills . Never found it but azaleas turned up in large quantity in the sandy soil around Sandtown . Made good collections of plants &amp; specimens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, May 23, 1951 Philadelphia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, May 24, 1951 Philadelphia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, May 25, 1951 Philadelphia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, May 26, 1951 Left at noon on Bethlehem pike &amp; Pa 12 for Scranton , U.S. 6 &amp; Pa 29 to Endicott , visited LaBar's Nursery at Stroudsburg , collected roseum on Big Pocono &amp; nudiflorum at the foot before driving on. Not very good roseum — or nudiflorum for that matter. Saw more azaleas along the way but did not collect further.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, May 27, 1951 Route: N.Y. 26 to Maine . Cut over to 38 via Newark Valley to Richford &amp; N.Y. 79 via Brooktondale to Ithaca for the night. Breakfast with the Bowens &amp; a mass collection of roseum on a hill above Binghamton . Another good collection with plants above Brooktondale . Still not good roseum &amp; no nudiflorum seen. It is evidently not present in the hill country of New York state.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, May 28, 1951 Route: from Ithaca , N.Y. 13 &amp; 17 to Painted Post , U.S 15 &amp; cut over to U.S 22 to Bedford via Altoona . Several side excursions into the hills in search of azaleas which unfortunately are getting very much "past" in Pa. Collected both roseum &amp; nudiflorum , however.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, May 29, 1951 Route: Pa Turnpike Bedford to Donegal , Pa 31 &amp; 982 to Connellsville , U.S. 119 &amp; 250 via Morgantown, W Va &amp; Grafton to Elkins for the night. In spite of early azaleas being past bloom across most of Pennsylvania — they were only approaching full on the high plateau or mountain between Baltimore &amp; Donegal on the Turnpike . Oaks , tho , were only just in leaf — It must be a very cool section! The first nudifloras were found in West Va in Barbour Co. Calendulaceum , too were observed in this Co from Philippi south altho none were collected. Mostly yellow or yellow—orange. Looks like good collecting for tomorrow?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, May 30, 1951 Route . Back rd from U.S. 33 around to U.S. 250 S. of Elkins . U.S. 250 to Durbin (with side trips). W. Va 28 &amp; branch rd to Cass . Over mountain from Cass to Linwood . U.S. 219 to Mingo for the night. Yellow to orange calendulaceums abundant throughout the region but no pure stands of small yellow. Near. Hosterman ran into another curious mixture of calend , roseum &amp; nudiflorum — hybridizing. Beautiful country with a bewildering array of hills to 3800 or 4000 ft. Tough land for farming yet stock raising seems to flourish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, May 31, 1951 Route: From Mingo to Valley Head , west on W. Va. 15 to Camp Caesar beyond Webster Springs . Side rd up the Williams River to Dyer . Back through Webster Springs &amp; N on W. Va 20 to Buckhannon , East to Elkins for the night. Again the same calendulaceum orange-yellow complex all day with a few pseudo nudiflorum interspersed. Arborescens at Camp Caesar not yet out. The hill top will bear watching in a week or so for later possibilities due to one, a red for[?] a Mr. Goddin who will take a trip a little later. Afraid the yellow must be sought much further south.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, June 1, 1951 Route: U.S. 33 from Elkins to Harrisonburg, Va , U.S 11 &amp; 211 to Luray, Va. Side trip at top of Cheat Mtn (gravel rd S. 4 mi from Elkins ) to find a. arborescens not yet in flower &amp; up Spruce Knob to see what there might be. Nothing right on the top but roseum a little lower just coming into flower &amp; a grand mixture of roseum , nudiflorum &amp; calendulaceum at about the ½way point. This was the last calendulaceum seen. Apparently it does not get much farther East in this region. None was seen on Shenandoah Mtn &amp; none are reported in the Blue Ridge . All of these mountains, however, had roseum &amp; nudiflorum —though none of the roseum very glandular. Still a blank on the small yellow azalea .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, June 2, 1951 Collected at two elevations on Pinnacle M t , Shenandoah N.P , &amp; calend. hybrid near Spitler Pt. Lookout . Talked with Paul Favour , returning key, map etc. Then too U.S. 211 to Warrenton, Va &amp; U.S. 17 &amp; Va 626 to Middleburgh . Looked up Gordon's family. M r. Seipp accompanied me on a run to the Catoctin M tn just N. of Point of Rocks in search of a "low white" reported by Forberg . No luck on this but secured nudiflorums from the same region.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, June 3, 1951 A terribly hot day. Collected mass nudiflorum with Harry Tyrell near Middleburgh &amp; decided to stay for the rest of the day, putting in time between gasps refixing the drier, checking specimens &amp; preparing a package of plants for shipment to Philadelphia .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, June 4, 1951 Route: U.S. 50 to Winchester , U.S. 11 to Christiansburg for the night. Shipped plants from Winchester but made time on the road rather than collecting along the way. It seems more important now to catch more of the southern material before it is completely ruined by the very dry weather. Visited Carol Woods folks for a few minutes in Salem . Carol not yet home from Harvard .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, June 5, 1951 Route: US. 11 to Wytheville , U.S. 58 via White Top Mtn &amp; Damascus to Abington , U.S 19 &amp; Va 70 to Norton, Va for the night. Calendulaceum was out on the lower slopes of the mountains &amp; halfway up White Top , not at the summit, however where they are not only late but seeming in appearance rather close to the reds of Black Mtn , Ky — cascading hybrids of this red type.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, June 6, 1951 Collected on High Nob just outside of Norton where the same late complex was found. They run to true yellows, however &amp; are far from pure cumberlandense or what—have you . Taking U.S. 23 to Appalachia , west up Big Black Mtn , meeting a group ( Hotchkiss — et al. ) from the Univ of Ky on top. The real reds are scarcely out — will take one or two weeks longer but the yellow (apparently normal calendulaceum ) was in full bloom on the Easterly slopes below. Even better red were found across the main highway which will bear revisiting. This red in its best forms makes a low, twiggy bush with glossy, glaucous leaves — definitely distinct from calendulaceum . The flowers too are considerably smaller. Still no small yellows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, June 7, 1951 Route: From Cumberland Ky 119 &amp; 15 via Pine &amp; Whitesburg to Hazard &amp; Jackson , Ky 30 &amp; US. 25 to London for the night. Azaleas of the small red complex were found on Pine Mtn — a status which was later found to be mentioned by Lucy Braun . The earliest out seemed to run considerably to orange. Some plants were stoloniferous. Plants past flower (presumably calendulaceum ) were found in Perry, &amp; Breathitt Cos &amp; a curious narrow tubed orange in full bloom in Owsley Co. It had all the earmarks of a diploid &amp; the yellow tube suggested hybridization of perhaps cumberlandense with a diploid yellow. This section needs search in mid May another year for the occurrence of such. A very heavy thunderstorm towards late afternoon &amp; a lousy cabin for tonight. Will retire early.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, June 8, 1951 Route: From London E on route 80 into Clay Co. Back to London &amp; S. via us 25 E to Pineville . Up Clear Springs Rd. to Log Mtn &amp; Pine Mtn. Back to 25 E &amp; into Middles— boro for the night. The Cumberlandense complex is evidently exceedingly common on the higher ridges of S.E. Kentucky . Have struck it with little effort in 7 counties so far. Suspect it to be a diploid complex with the yellow still to be found &amp; probably in the same region. They were abundant up Laurel Mtn this afternoon, tho' not at the top &amp; also on Pine Mtn. this is a region to strike in Early to mid May on some future occasion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, June 9, 1951 Route: From Middlesboro via Ky 74 &amp; Ten 90 to US. 25 W. from Williamsburg W to Pine Knot &amp; N. to beyond Whitley for the Yahoo Ridge collection. Then S. into Tenn &amp; Oneida on U.S. 27. Cheifly Cumberlandense material from the high points. They were seen in fair number in McCreary Co on Ky 92, but not collected. Yahoo Ridge itself has probably overgrown a great deal since Miss Braun's time. Hard to find except where the woods have been cut, in this case near the road &amp; the fire tower. They are evidently extending well into Tennessee .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, June 10, 1951 Route: Oneida to Elgin via U.S. 27, Tenn to Jamestown for the night. Cumberlandense in several places in Scott Co but hunted unsuccessfully so far in Fentress Co. Found, however a bunch of probable hybrids with arborescens as well as the latter itself — in full bloom. The hybrids were disappointing in that the pale yellows first seen gave promised of a diploid yellow at last. Will still watch the swamp, however. Packed plants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, June 11, 1951 Route: From Jamestown on Tenn 28 to Grimsley — Tenn 85 to Wilder &amp; back, 28 to Crossville &amp; 70 to Sparta for the night. Obtained good Cumberlandense outside Jamestown , finally &amp; excellent collecting just below Wilder . At Crossville looked up M r Adams , the florist, &amp; went on to Bon Air hoping to find it around there. It is probably in the vicinity but could not spend long enough to search the woods. The natives seemed unfamiliar with the orange color. Shipped plants from Crossville .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, June 12, 1951 Route: 70 to McMinnville . Just beyond McMinnville for a swamp type. Back &amp; up Tenn 8 (not on map) to the plateau again. Followed 8 via Dunlap to the foot of Signal Mtn for the night. Visited the Forest Nurseries in McMinnville , talking especially with M r &amp; his son who had some advice on azaleas as well as kindly finding a source for 35 sheets of waterproof wrapping paper. Rain commenced on top of the plateau &amp; got thoroughly soaked finally finding a good spot (near Spencer for a mass collection of cumberlandense . They are all throughout the woods if you can just take time to find them — usually on a slop above a stream with often nudiflorum type &amp; arborescens near the stream itself. Arborescens in bloom at this spot. More cumberlandense on way down to Sequatchee Valley &amp; also on Signal Mtn. Locally abundant but take a lot of between nights. A foul night. Also lost an hour through the time change.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, June 13, 1951 Route: Back to Signal Mtn to finish a mass collection, then through Chattanooga &amp; on U.S. 41 to Dalton &amp; 76 via Elljay to Morganton &amp; Ga 60 to Murphy, N.C. for the night. Found Cumberlandense abundant on the top of Fort Mtn &amp; essentially the same as all the way from Kentucky . It is evidently heading for the Smokies. Definitely a plant of the higher elevations — better than 3,000 ft.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, June 14, 1951 Talking plans with Nicholls , got off to a rather late start. Intended doing Wayah Bald &amp; heading for Neal Gap but at Andrews decided to have the car thermostat removed &amp; also got a grease &amp; oil job. This meant further delay so that it was noon when the first gap (about 3500 ft ) was reached on the way to Wayoh . Just below the crest noticed was looked like normal, but late calendulaceum . Investigation showed an extraordinary mixture — a few calendulaceum with a good small stand of Cumberlandense surrounded by the kitchen sink of varying heights, colors &amp; flower sizes — all the way from flowers 85 mms to about 35. Evidently either a hybrid swarm of the two or cumberlandense gone will in producing polyploids. Probably the former. Some of the largest may well be tetraploists , however. Gathering &amp; recording an extra large mass collection, 10 or a dozen plants with photographic studies in color &amp; B &amp; W, however took until 5.0 clock , so returned once more to Murphy for the night. Will hope to do Wayah tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, June 15, 1951 With seeming difficulty finally made the top of Wayah Bald today &amp; down the other side to Franklin for the night. Azaleas on the Mtn are more confusing &amp; more time consuming than any population so far met. Yesterdays " Cumberlandense — calendulaceum " complex was found today to cover the whole extent of the Wayah region. While at first these seemed some sorting in normal calendulaceum &amp; normal cum , this was completely lost after passing Nantahala Lake . It settled down to a complete blend of the two which covered the summit of the mountain — all colors, intermediate sized flowers, fairly late bloom, considerable leaf glaucesence &amp; more or less intermediate height, What the cytology of such a mix can be it is impossible to guess. It was noted that the normal calendulaceum in flower 3 weeks ago &amp; photographed has now completely gone. The first arborescens were in flower on the summit but will need a visit in 10 days time for best effect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, June 16, 1951 Route: N.C. 28 to Highlands , 106 &amp; U.S. 23 to Clayton , U.S. 76 &amp; 19 to cabins near Vogel State Park . Talked with Rev. Morgan in Franklin who suggested revisiting Wayah in about 3 weeks for a late type of orange. At Highlands tried unsuccessfully to find Henry Wright for information on local plants. Collected late calendulaceum just W of Highlands &amp; also my first viscosum . Mass collected Bakeri at Vogel State Park in the evening. Similar to Cumberlandense but rather tall, rather large flowered &amp; less leaf glaucous. A few other mountains nearby may tell the story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, June 17, 1951 Route: To Neel's Gap , back to Vogel State Park &amp; via Ga 180 (?) &amp; 60 to Porter Springs . U.S. 19 to Dawsonville , Ga 53, 183, 136 &amp; 108 to Jasper , 53 to Calhoun for the night. A wet early morning. Photographed &amp; collected plants at Bakeri type locality. Collected again just beyond Woody Gap . They are quite plentiful in this general high region &amp; it is suspected that they may be found on most of the high spots of Northern Georgia . Certainly still abundant around Brush &amp; Oglethorpe Mts where they seem to be sorting out again more towards the dwarfer, glaucous leaved type. It will be interesting to find whether the good type can be unearthed in Alabama .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, June 18, 1951 Route: Ga to Rome , 27 &amp; 48 to Valley Head, Ala , via Pisgah &amp; Dalton to Section &amp; Scottsboro . Return trip to Kyles in Jackson Co. Night at Scottsboro . This has been chiefly a search of the high spots for the Cumberlandense complex. Various ridges in Ga yielded nothing — neither did Lookout or Sand Mts. None were seen &amp; several likely natives were questioned — all with negative results. Back on the Cumberland plateau , however, in Jackson Co Ala. the story was different. The first homeowner on the plateau said "plenty of them — help yourself behind the house". Just beyond this place a small valley was filled with them. They are extremely plentiful — here. We will see tomorrow if they still go farther south. Unfortunately that few not sorted sit anymore that's over the rest of their range. Plenty of arborescens along streams at fair altitudes. Almost invariably, though, either not yet out or past bloom. Almost impossible to get any sort of a mass&gt;lb/&gt; collection. Also picked up a few of the nudiflorum complex from this part of Alabama .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, June 19, 1951 Route: Ala 32 &amp; US. 241 to Oxford via Guntersville , Gadsden &amp; Anniston , unnumbered rd SE of Oxford to Cheaha State Park on top of Cheaha Mtn. From there S.W. to Talladega for the night. Well, this was pulling a long shot today. Decided to try Cheaha Mt before heading once more for Cullman Co. — &amp; it paid off! Cumberlandense abundant on the top. But it is still mixed — with its apricot colors &amp; orange blotches &amp; glaucous &amp; non glaucous . Would swear that this, at least, is an isolated spot. If so, the mixing must have occurred a very long time ago. Some very low, twiggy glaucous reds are here too. This surely is one of the types, if I can only somewhere find it in a pure state! Decided to have a bust tonight &amp; enjoy the hospitality of the "world" famous Purefoy Hotel of Talladega . Quite enjoyable but not so much of a bust as was expected. $2.50 for the room. All you can eat from 30 dishes for supper — for $11.65!!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, June 20, 1951 Route: From Talladega on U.S. 241 &amp; Ala to Childersburg , ala 91 to Birmingham , U.S. 31 to Cullman , Ala 69 &amp; back roads via Arley to Addison , Ala 112 to Double Springs &amp; 5 to Russellville for the night. No collecting to day . Mostly a fruitless search for Cumberlandense . No signs of it on Double Oak Mtn S. of Birmingham or in Cullman or Winston Cos or the Bankhead National Forest or even on the west escarpment of the plateau approaching Russellville . The plateau is evidently too low in this region. The Forest Ranger , M r Cranston , however, will keep on the lookout &amp; let me know if he should learn of it. Picked up a couple of plants of alabamense hybrids. Surprised at finding no arborescescens — canescens , along the streams of the region.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, June 21, 1951 Route: Ala 5 to Tuscumbia , US 72 to Memphis, Tenn , US 70 via Little Rock to Hot Springs &amp; 220 to Mt Ida for the night — a total of 408 miles for the day. No collecting for today. Stopped, however, at Warm Springs for advices from the Ouchita Forest Headquarters &amp; secured a map of the areas — also visited the hot springs &amp; found them rather unimpressive. Hydrangea &amp; other flowers seen in much the same stage of flower as in Alabama so there is a good chance that at least some azaleas should show up tomorrow. A very hot day for driving but cooling somewhat tonight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, June 22, 1951 From Mt Ida to Mena via U.S. 270. Skyline rd over Rich Mtn to Okla 63. Side rd. N. to Page . Us 270 &amp; Okla 63 to Mansfield, Ark. U.S. 71 &amp; Ark 23 to Booneville , Ark 10 to Havana &amp; rd N. to top of Magazine Mtn for the night. Azaleas seen in only 2 places &amp; both apparently the more typical ( roseum ) phase of oblongifolium. Many swamps examined but nothing seen of the viscosum or serrulatum type — as yet. The regin is drier than expected &amp; scarcely congenial, one would think, for azaleas . Yet they were quite abundant in one spot. Magazine Mtn looks like the most promising so far as other vegetation is concerned but no azaleas at all have been seen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, June 23, 1951 Ran down the N side of Magazine Mtn , after finding nothing on top &amp; inquired if azaleas from a farmer on the rd — a M r Lee of Flat Top Mtn. He kindly came with me to his old homestead in Heath Hollow where there were loads of azaleas evidently both pink &amp; white. A good mass collection. He claims these to be the only ones around Magazine Mtn. Back &amp; on to Paris for lunch. Then via Ark. 22 &amp; 23 to Cass &amp; the rd W. to the top of White Rock Mtn. Down on the west side &amp; out another rd striking U.S. 71 just S. of Winslow . Stayed nearby for the night. Azaleas seem much more abundant in the White Rock region &amp; must be a picture at the top of the M tn ( N. side) perhaps a month earlier. Evidently the roseum phase. Nothing else of special interest seen. The stay at Magazine Lodge was very pleasant &amp; made especially so by the courtesy of the manager, Robert Wilson of Winslow who gave much information concerning the Boston Mts. There seems nothing special to hold me here longer, however.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, June 24, 1951 No collecting. A straight run through from Winslow, Ark , to Fairview, Ky via US 71 &amp; 64 to Bald Knob , 67 to Poplar Bluff, Mo , 60 to Paducah, Ky &amp; 68 on. A miserable humid hot day complete with Sunday drivers at their very worst &amp; a rather wretched "modern"!! Hotel for the night. I doubt if the room will cool at all by tomorrow morning. 575 miles for the day!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, June 25, 1951 Another straight through job with only two pauses — the first early in the morn to get a flat front fixed (another rim wear) &amp; the second for a "short trip" at Mammoth Cave — rather a waste of time — particularly since it resulted in sufficient delay to have the post office closed on this end — at Appalachia . Another terrifically hot day with wretched winding roads at this end of Kentucky . Route: US. 68 to Bowling Green , 31 W to Mammoth Cave , Ky 70 to U.S. 68 &amp; Edmonton , Ky 80 to London ; US. 25 &amp; 25 E to Pineville , US. 119 to Harlan ; US 421 to Pennington Gap ; Va 70 (58 alt. ) to Big Stone Gap &amp; Appalachia . Total 451 miles for the day. Did not see an azalea .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, June 26, 1951 Route: Appalachia to Norton &amp; Va to Lebanon , US. 19 to Tazewell for the night. Spent to early afternoon collecting on Black Mtn which was still in excellent shape though some bushes were a bit past. Evidently a hybrid group much like those of Wayah Bald . Cumberlandense is plentiful throughout Wise Co on the higher points. It was not seen beyond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, June 27, 1951 Doubled back from Tazewell over Va 91 to Marion which crosses 3 Mtn around 3000 ft elev. Only calendulaceum seen, however, no cumberlandense . From Marion followed U.S. 11 to Va 114 &amp; US 460 with a side run in to Mountain Lake . A good mass collection here of viscosum &amp; for arborescens &amp; a little calendulaceum but still no Cumberlandense at 4000 ft on Bald Mtn. Followed back again to U.S. 219 &amp; on to around Marlinton for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, June 28, 1951 Did not get very far today. Drove on over 219 to Elkins , picked up Mr Goddin &amp; ran out W. Va 4 to Cheat Mtn for a mass collection of arborescens . Back to Elkins &amp; spent some time getting odd items on the truck checked, including a new set of spark plugs — this time J11 s instead of the wrong J7s which it had. P.M. ran out to the Cheat Mtn plateau again on U.S 250 to Durbin . Mountain Laurel was in full flower but not an azalea of any kind to be seen — no blueberries either. Seems a typical Canadian flora with cornus canadensis , sorbus , viburnum alnifolium &amp; pure spruce forest on the peaks. Accordingly spent remainder of the afternoon making up a package of plants for shipping to Philadelphia .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, June 29, 1951 Started at 7.15 with M r Goddin for a 46 mile drive to a mountain in the Allegheny Front ( N of Spruce Knob ) to find a "plum red" azalea . We found it — on a high Canadian zone plateau — in fair quantity — a. roseum ! Got a mass collection, anyway, although it is rather poor roseum at that. Returning to Elkins , sent off the plants &amp; headed S. on 219 to Valley Head , then S.W. on routes 15 &amp; 20 to Craigsville (much arborescens around here), W. on 41 &amp; S. on U.S. 19 ^ to Beckley for the night. No signs of cumberlandense in spite of very high territory much of the way, especially on rt. 15 from soon after Valley Head practically to Webster Springs . The New River cuts into the plateau in a very deep gorge around Prince . Will cruise a little further west tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, June 30, 1951 Route: from Beckley over W. Va 3 to Ivy Knob fire tower. Back to Glen Daniel &amp; over to Jesse , up W. Va 10 to Oceana &amp; over terrible dirt rd via Kepperton over mountain, through Bald Nob etc &amp; out eventually at Madison . Down U.S. 119, 52, 119, 460, 19 &amp; 11 to nearly at Bristol for the night. A very disappointing day with only 2 calendulaceum , no cumberlandense or arborescens , bad roads, quantities of rain &amp; no cabins until 10.30 p.m. Heaven spare us from any more of West Virginia !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, July 1, 1951 Another day with rather poor collecting. Followed through Bristol to Elizabethton, Tenn where took time to have a left front tire fixed — new inner tube &amp; spare substituted. On to Roan Mtn &amp; up mountain from the Tennessee side. Once on the top had to wait in cloud &amp; rain for 3½ hrs until the return road was open at 3.0 pm. — a tragic waste of time since not an azalea was to be seen any way — only a few dead calendulaceum on the way up. Returned on N.C. side &amp; travelled via N.C. 26 &amp; U.S. 191 to Newland &amp; Linville for the night. One nice pink viscosum seen in front of a house at Newland . A few normal whites collected in the vicinity. Hope for better luck tomorrow. This late season stuff is not really so easy to catch! Arborescens not yet in flower around here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, July 2, 1951 Better luck today. ran up Grandfather M tn first thing in the morning. Nothing on top but collected the late calendulaceum complex at about 4000 ft toward the road entrance. Follow U.S. 221 to Ashford &amp; looked up M r E.C. Robbins who was full of conversation but had very little — in fact nothing — constructive to off as far as azaleas are concerned. He is as vague as most nurserymen about them. Cut back to the Blue Ridge Parkway &amp; collected the same type azaleas plus arborescens near Crabtree Meadows . Up M t Mitchell &amp; found &amp; saw nothing. No azaleas &amp; no view due to heavy clouds. Collected again, however near Craggy Gardens . Down to Asheville . No place to stay so on to Canton on U.S. 19 where a cabin eventually turned up though the owner had to be Jewed down $1.00 on the price. Seems O.K. though.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, July 3, 1951 Route: S. from Canton on 110 &amp; U.S. 276 to Great Pisgah Mtn. Back on 276 to Waynesville for the night. Good collecting of arborescens on the way to Pisgah &amp; it, viscosum &amp; late oranges on the Mtn. 4 mass collections today. Returned in very good time in order to get a cabin before the rush started &amp; was lucky in this respect. This gave much needed time to overhaul the drier &amp; extract a considerable of the noise &amp; vibration. Viscosum &amp; arborescens were having a grand juncture of hybridization. It was difficult to find much straight viscosum with any flowers. Crowds are bad for the 4 th tomorrow. Will choose some very out of the way dirt roads — probably to Max Patch Mtn , to get to Gatlinburg when the rush is over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, July 4, 1951 Route: Waynesville 19A &amp; Lake Junaluska on N.C. 209 &amp; various gravel rd detours over top of Max Patch Mtn &amp; down west side to Del Rio . Via U.S. 70 to Newport for ^ &amp; 35 to Sevierville the night. A good out of the way road for the 4 th of July &amp; found plenty of late calendulaceum type on Max Patch — but that was all. No arborescens as expected. Arrived at Newport fairly early &amp; splurged on a double cabin (my only choice) so was able to spread out &amp; sort &amp; pack all the dried specimens for return to Phila.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, July 5, 1951 Tried unsuccessfully to ship specimens at Sevierville so drove on to Park Headquarters at Gatlinburg . Saw Stupka &amp; decided on a trip to Gregory Bald . Bought supplies &amp; picked up mail in Gatlinburg &amp; drove via park road &amp; Cades Cove to parking area at start of 4½ mi hike to top of mtn. Getting everything (except enough blankets) packed up, started up mountain just after 4.0 p.m. In spite of Stupka's warning of a hard 4 hr climb I found it a climb all right but made it to the Gregory Ridge Shelter in just 2 hrs &amp; 25 minutes so was able to get fed &amp; take a quick round of the mountain top before dark. What an amazing horticulturists paradise! &amp; what a job for tomorrow! Arthur Stupka was helpful &amp; wants plenty of reprints of anything concerning his azaleas . Suggested Soco Bald as another possible spot for collecting. Checked his herbarium but did not do much other than change all his nudiflorums to canescens . Only a dozen or so specimens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, July 6, 1951 A miserable night. 1½ blankets not enough to either keep out the cold or soften the hardware cloth bed. Only a persistent mouse for company — plus something which walked off with some leavings in a paper bag. Tackled the Bald after breakfast &amp; what a mass. A quick inspection of the "whites" indicated something fishy afoot — something obviously besides arborescens . The clues were not on Gregory , however, so before doing any more collecting decided to try Parson Bald , a mile or so away, &amp; see what might be found there. The answer was obvious — in the form of a beautiful patch of unadulterated viscosum all over the S. end. Mass collected this &amp; the reds on Parson &amp; returned to Gregory to finish a mass collection of whites plus one of reds, one of obvious hybrids &amp; one 20—pace—collection for a population sample. The effects of arborescens were obvious but no true arborescens was found — either in the woods surrounding the "bald" or down the stream below the cabin. Can only conclude that it was probably once there in smaller quantity than on Wayah Bald but has now practically become swamped. The reds are redder but probably of similar ancestry to those of Wayah . Gathered plenty of fern fronds for a softer &amp; warmer bed for the second night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, July 10, 1951 Route: Robbinsville via Topton to Nantahala , over the " winding Steps" road via Aquone to Franklin for the night. Side detours from White Oak to Burning town Gap &amp; to Wayah &amp; Wine Spring Balds . The word "Bald" is a misnomer. Neither Burning town nor Wine spring are true "balds" — &amp; neither has more than the late reds in the way of azaleas . Caught in a bad thunderstorm on winespring &amp; had to repair to Wayah Tower to change everything I had on. Several fair collections of arborescens along Nantahala river , White Oak Creek &amp; again on Wayah . Also secured plants of some late oranges only just coming into bloom. At Mrs. Jones tourist home for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, July 11, 1951 Started the morning with a flat tire — last, I hope, of the rim rubbed tubes! North on the Bryson City rd. to Coweee Bald . Gathered orange azalea past bloom but that was all. Back via Franklin &amp; over N.C. 28 to Highlands for the night. Collecting here very good. Had lunch on Satulah Mtn &amp; collected pretty steadily from then on. The Mtn , from elevation of Highlands (3800 ft ) up is smothered in a mixture of arborescens &amp; late red—orange though strangely without too much obvious hybridization. Probably the new territory was not available, as at Gregory , for hybridization to show up Then too viscosum is all around, though somewhat hard to find in bloom. It may have an off season. With the help of M r Henry Wright , however, found several specimens at his place where there also grow, quite naturally, a bush of viscosum — arborescens hybrids. One of these, a very large pink, is an extremely beautiful thing. Cabins were scarce as hens teeth &amp; had to end in paying the double rate, unfortunately necessary with so many specimens to get in press &amp; dried.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, July 12, 1951 Route: From Highlands , via 106 &amp; US. 23 to Gainesville, Ga Ga 141 &amp; US. 19 &amp; Ga 120 to Marietta ; Ga 120, 61 to Carrollton (Shirt), Ga 16, 14 &amp; 18 via Greenville &amp; Woodbury to Thomaston for the night. Pretty much of a thorough trip towards Cuthbert but stopped at M r Lemmon 's at Marietta for a chat &amp; stayed to lunch. Then on to Upson Co to try &amp; find arborescens reported there a year or two ago. Made several unhappy attempts on an awful road down the Flint river . Fell into a nest of yellowjackets &amp; was stung by 2 hornets shortly after as well as ripping my pants practically to shreds on concealed barbed wire. Met a man, however who tells me they definitely grow on Blue Lake on the Elkins Creek so will have one more attempt in the morning. 95° weather today in central Georgia .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, July 13, 1951 Route: Back to Woodbury on Ga 74, with detours to Pleasant Valley etc., S. on Ga 85 via Manchester to Columbus &amp; U.S. 27 to Cuthbert . On via Ga. 37 to Fort Gaines , staying with M r Coleman for the night. After several futile attempts to find az. arborescens on its Elkins Creek finally found it at the bottom of Long Branch in Pleasant Valley . Nice, very white stuff, strangely enough only just coming into bloom. At Cuthbert found prunifolium without much difficulty in a small ravine 3½ mi N. of the town. The original locality, 2 mi N.W. of Cuthbert , is probably now a golf course. Much to discuss with M r Coleman who is a very keen hobbyist having a considerable collection of native azaleas .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, July 14, 1951 Spent morning with M r Coleman at his Azalea Trail — a very nice layout. In afternoon looked up locations for an early flowering serrulata type &amp; also for a small collection of pruniflorium before getting rained out by a thunderstorm. Dug a plant of his multiflora for shipment to Philadelphia . Stayed a second night with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, July 15, 1951 Route: E. via Ga &amp; U.S. 27 via Carnegie to Seven Bridges for az. serrulata . Back through Fort Gaines to just across the river for a good mass collection plus several plants of pruniflorium on Ala 10, then continued on 10 to Abbeville &amp; N on US. 241 to Eufaula for the night. Another very hot day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, July 16, 1951 Traveled 6 mi N. from Eufaula to visit M rs E.E. Clark &amp; secure specimens of a late flowering canescens — alabamense type azalea . She also gave me pieces of 2 color forms of hers. Back across County towards Fort Gaines but missed locality for a collection of prunifolium so into town for a second visit with M r Coleman &amp; specimens of his yellow austrinums . Came away with a plant as well. Added to final collection of prunifolium just S. of Fort Gaines &amp; drove a second time towards Abbeville on the dirt road, this time finally locating a ravine with at least a few very large plants in bloom — just before dark. Supper in Abbeville &amp; south to Dothan for the night. A one spot in the morning 3 prunifoliums were found which had all layered themselves very freely. A subsequent fire had burnt out the connecting branches so that a grand supply of small plants were there for the taking. They were growing in practically pure quartz sand — with only a few leaves on top.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, July 17, 1951 Another very hot day &amp; not too much progress — chiefly because the entire morning was spent in packing a fairly large batch of plants &amp; in taking these to Ozark , the only fringe beetle free shipping point in all of this part of Alabama . Also mailed films for development. Travelled from Dothan to Ozark &amp; back via U.S 231 to Newton , then W. on U.S. 84 to Andalusia for the night. Stopped in 3 or 4 swamps in the afternoon but could find no serrulatum . It should be in the region. Better luck, perhaps, tomorrow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, July 18, 1951 Travelled US. 85 from Andalusia to Laurel, Miss , for the night. Two collections only — both of the early flowering serrulatum complex. These plants are interesting in their choice of habitat — within 10—12 ft of a stream but always on the drier ground above the stream. Unfortunately they are usually in pretty dense shade so that old flowers or seed pods are hard to find. Obtained about 8 plants for flowering samples. Hot again — almost stifling in the early afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, July 19, 1951 Route: From Laurel via U.S. 11 to Hattiesburg , then E on Miss 24 via Columbia to Tylertown &amp; S. on La 34 to Covington for the night. Pulled in 2 mass collections of serrulatum plus some county collections as well. The mass collections are not easy for in the shade it is an exceedingly spotty bloomer. Down this way the flowers seem to be getting larger &amp;, curiously, with red pedicels &amp; often red glands. One wonders where they come from. No further sign of the May flowering type although I searched plenty for it today. Another wearysome hot day with one very heavy thunderstorm — &amp; a flat tire just before pulling into Covington . Also left my little spade behind — unfortunately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, July 20, 1951 From Covington followed through on U.S. 190 &amp; 90 via Mobile to just beyond Mobile bay for the night. Another hot day &amp; very heavy traffic all along the coast. Detoured north at Biloxi, La for a mass collection of serrulatum &amp; pulled in a small one nearby this evening. For some reason the ones near here are still pretty much in bud. Their leaves seem large too. May be a slightly different strain or the climate may not be quite as warm as inland. Made up the lost shined in Mobile . Tried to contact Charles Rogers but no luck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, July 21, 1951 Followed U.S. 90 all the way to Marianna , picking up a couple of mass collections of serrulata , which seem to crop up in just about all the larger swamps. Called on M r J.L. Peacock of Peacock's Court, Marianna , at M r Coleman's suggestion. He only apparently knew of serrulata at Rock Bluff which I'll look up tomorrow, assuming it to be exactly the same as have been getting right along. Leaving him, headed S. on Fla 71, got one more mass coll. at Chipola before heading on via Blountstown to Bristol for the night. Passed through 3 heavy thunderstorms during the day. A fourth is building up now by all the lightening .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, July 22, 1951 Route: From Bristol N.E. on Fla 12 to turning to Rock Bluff . Took in Torreya State Park &amp; back via Rock Bluff &amp; Sycamore to 12 &amp; U.S. 90 to Tallahassee . Then on U.S. 27 to High Springs for the night. Only one mass collection not far out of Tallahassee . Swampy areas complete with hardwoods &amp; a cypress or two are very scarce in this region. Even the rivers, like the Suwanee , are too steep sided for an azalea population. Will circle a bit in the morning &amp; see if a pond or two may be in sight, but Peacocks azaleas are the same as the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, July 23, 1951 Route . From High Springs via U.S. 27 to Fla 44 to Eustis for the night. No azalea seen the whole way down. They are evidently confined to the central higher ground of Florida &amp; then occur only around the small freshwater branches &amp; springs— not in the standing swamps. At Eustis found them very quietly just outside of town but only in one burned over patch which was not good for specimens though collected plants. It was a vain search for any more from 3.0 pm until after dark &amp; was then so disgusted that I went to my first movie of the entire trip — something terrible about a Bird of Paradise</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, July 24, 1951 Much better luck this morning. The florist in Eustis , M r &amp; M rs Bishop , sent me to their own place just outside town where there were quantities of azaleas for the wandering &amp; the picking &amp; many still in bloom &amp; some yet to come. Could not get away until noon &amp; then proceeded south on routes 19 &amp; U.S. 27 to the Winter Haven area. No luck, however so came on to Sebring for the night. Will try &amp; get a lead at Highlands Hammock Park tomorrow &amp; perhaps at Cypress Gardens on the way back. These things are so terribly localized that without such help one could waste literally days in trying to find them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, July 25, 1951 Drive S. from Sebring to beyond Lake Placid on the old road (17) &amp; stopped at Archbold Biological Station at the suggestion of a Conservation Agent met along the way. D r (?) Archbold showed me specimens of serrulata collected by D r L.J. Brass of their staff &amp; offered to take me to a location for it S. of Lake Istokpoga . When we got there the whole lot had been bulldozed out but more were found a mile away — enough for a mass collection. On the way back stopped in at Highlands Hammock State Park &amp; was shown around by the botanist, Miss Beck . Lots of azaleas there. The hammock &amp; cypress swamps are particularly fine. In late afternoon obtained leads from David K. Stabler of Winter Haven Nurseries regarding locations for azaleas farther norther . Stabler was suggested by M r McMillan , supt. of the Bok Tower Sanctuary . Night just north of Winter Haven .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, July 26, 1951 From Winter Haven travelled to Palatka on U.S 17, then N.W on Fla 100 to Lake City for the night. Collected along the way beyond Haines City &amp; again at Gold Head Branch State Park . Did not notice other azaleas &amp; did not take the time to hunt for them since it is already getting so late. Want to fill in then somewhere around this point tomorrow then on to Folkston &amp; north.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, July 27, 1951 Found no azalea around Lake City so drove N.W. to White Springs . Still no luck &amp; noone knew of them which seems that they just may not be in the region. Decided to keep on however, so continued on U.S. 41 &amp; finally pulled a mass collection of serrulatum just shy of the Ga. border. (on U.S.129) Followed this to Stockton, Ga , &amp; then N.E. on U.S. 84 to Waycross . &amp; S. on U.S. 1 to Folkston for the night. Made 2 more collections along the way &amp; also got mail at Folkston before collecting again in the type locality of serrulatum georgianum — all apparently true to type with good pubescent winter buds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, July 28,1951 Route: E on Ga 42 to Ga to Woodbine , N. on U.S. 17 to Savannah for the night. Just out of Folkston made one more small mass collection of georgianum . It didn't look too good. Ran into quantities of Befaria all along the road to Woodbine . Plants, however, are very hard to dig in such sandy pine — palmetto soil. No azalea seen beyond Camden Co. Am afraid U.S. 17 is running a little too close to the coast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, July 29, 1951 Route Savannah via Ga 21 to Sylvania &amp; U.S. 301 to Allendale, S.C. On a quest for northern outposts of serrulata ran into what is evidently viscosum just N. of Springfield in Effingham Co. But at Oliver , in Screven Co , ran into the kitchen sink. A swamp whose center is a field with serrulata , side bordered with something low &amp; sometimes something very pubescent which is not viscosum &amp; outside of this a ring of canescens . A very confusing situation which may not be helped much by closer examination.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, July 30, 1951 Route . From Allendale on 301. to Florence, S.C. for the night. Found small viscosums along the way in various places on a few excursions to fill in an odd county or two. Tried particularly for Witmer Stone's locality for atlanticum at Manning &amp; found, as expected that it was in reality a pretty good set of low growing pine barren viscosum . This was repeated near Florence in a finer locality for serrulata — which seemed out of place. Again viscosum but this time a curious very low &amp; glaucescent little thing. Must see tomorrow if the same crops up again nearby.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, July 31, 1951 Route: Florence to near Whitakers via U.S. 301 for the night. Chiefly viscosum picked up along the way including at Selma — no atlantici seen but did not search the drier pine barrens. Viscosum apparently is always is always in the more permanently moist places where it is usually associated with bamboo , magnolia etc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, August 1, 1951 Route: via 301 to Richmond , U.S. 1 via Washington to somewhat beyond College Park, Md. for the night. Picked up more sets of viscosum — just across the Virginia line &amp; just north of Richmond . They type localities at Hyattsville, Md. , are apparently hopeless. There is probably no swamp left without it's building development in the middles . Color forms, moreover would be scarcely findable at this season.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, August 2, 1951 Via U.S. 1 to Phila. A last collection just S. of Elkton, Md. where it is abundant along a small stream. Lunch at Swarthmore with H. Wood &amp; back by about 2.0 p.m.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, August 5, 1951</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Monday, August 6, 1951 Left Phila about 7.30am &amp; travelled to N.J. via Pa 73, the Tacony P. &amp; N.J. 341 &amp; U.S. 30. A properly confusing set of viscosum collected near Chesilhurt , &amp; another proceeding north on U.S. 206 near Atsion . A third just S. of Milltown &amp; with this on N.Y. City on U S. 1 to Darien, Conn. , for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tuesday, August 7, 1951 Route: US 1 to Providence , U.S. 6 &amp; Mass 28 via Buzzards Bay &amp; Falmouth to Woods Hole . Collected very mixed viscosum just w. of New London but did not get to Woods Hole in time to more than look at the at D r Schramms House — just about past bloom with no intact flowers left. Called the Wigleys from Buzzards Bay &amp; took the 7.45 ferry to Marthas Vineyard , staying with them for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wednesday, August 8, 1951 All day on Marthas Vineyard &amp; a drenching day. In the a.m. drove to Tea Lane in West Tisbury to look up George Graves . On Tea Lane made a mass collection of viscosum which is very plentiful in the moist fields &amp; woods. Several plants were in flower &amp; pieces were dug for testing in Philadelphia . Stayed indoors in the afternoon — to dry off &amp; attended a concert in the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday, August 9, 1951 Caught the 8.15 ferry back to Woods Hole . Dug a plant at D r Schramms' &amp; took Mass 28 NE from Falmouth , turning back on Mass 151 towards Buzzards Bay &amp; getting a fine mass collection not far along. About 8 large plants were still in good bloom — one with quantities of buds yet to open. Obtained several plants. Viscosum here borders the small ponds toward the center of the cape. Made slow progress through New Bedford &amp; Providence &amp; stayed near Hampton on U.S. 6 for the night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday, August 10, 1951 Route: Via U.S. 6, through Danby , Peekskill , Port Jervis &amp; Milford , then Penn 507 to S. Sterling for the night. Good collections of something resembling a. arborescens in a swamp in a swamp in the Palisades Interstate Park &amp; swamps of the Poconos along the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Saturday, August 11, 1951 The day around S. Sterling with the Harry Woods , taking in collections of the same arborescens — viscosum complex at the head of Paupack Lake in the morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday, August 12, 1951 Return to Philadelphia via Us. 209 via Lehighton , Tamaqua to Pottsville , Pa 443, 83, U.S 22 &amp; Pa 934 &amp; 72 via Schuykill Haven , Schubert , Annville &amp; Lebanon to Cornwall &amp; the Penna Turnpike . After considerable searching finally turned up but one collection of rather poor viscosum not far from Cornwall on the Horseshoe Trail in Lebanon Co , Pa. Arrived back in Chestnut Hill about 8.30 p.m.</field>
