'Ákoo Tł'ízhe hooghéí dá'áíná bikoͅ' 'ólíná'a. Long ago, there was no fire. Then only those who are called Flies had fire. Then the Flies held a ceremony. (10.2) 'Ákoo Tł'ízheí gotál yiis'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo Mai'áee híłghoná'a. Gotál jiis'áͅí 'áee, Mai tsíbaͅaͅee naaná'azhishná'a. 'Ákoo bitseeí tsínáiłgoná'a. Then the Flies held a ceremony. And Coyote came there 1 . At that place where they held the ceremony, Coyote danced around and around at the edge of the fire. And he continually poked his tail in the fire. Then they spoke thus to him: (10.3) 'Ákoo 'áałji n díná'a: "Shóͅóͅdé, ntsee dili'." biłji n díná'a. Then they spoke thus to him: "Friend, your tail will burn," they said to him. Then: (10.4) 'Ákoo: "Chéek'e dili' !" gooł n díná'a. 'Ákoo bitseeí tsíyóółgee. Bitseeí bitł'áshíͅ koͅoͅ dahiitoo. Then: "Let it burn!" he said to them. And he put his tail in the fire. The fire flared up under his tail. Then many of them circled around him. (10.5) 'Ákoo jiláͅgo nandaajíńt'i. Tł'ízheí, 'áí 'ádaat'íͅ. 'Ákoo 'áí jiláͅgo nandaajíńt'i ndah gotisá 'áí maií koͅoͅí kaiłyaanáałghoná'a. Kaiłnádaadiiłghoná'a koͅoͅí. Bikéya 'iładaashdeeskaná'a. Then many of them circled around him. The Flies, they did so. Then many of them circled around him but that Coyote jumped over [and] away from them with the fire. He ran away from them with the fire. They ran behind him. Then, farther on, he gave fire to the Eagle. (10.6) 'Ákoo, n dáséshíͅ, 'Itsá koͅoͅ yaayíńłt'áͅ. 'Áshíͅ, 'áńdeeda. díí dziłí bighe'yá díík'een koͅoͅí naideesgeená'a. 'Iłch'áͅgo daagodeek'aͅaͅná'a. Then, farther on, he gave fire to the Eagle. At that place, now, he scattered the fire all over among these mountains. Fire was burning in every direction. Then these Flies tried to put out the fire but they tried in vain. (10.7) 'Ákoo díídíí Tł'ízheí koͅoͅí daayinłtséés ndah ch'éda'ádaayóół'iͅiͅná'a. Then these Flies tried to put out the fire but they tried in vain. Then, that Coyote having been helped by the blowing of the wind, the fire, becoming impossible to control, burned on. (10.8) "Ákoo 'áń Ma'yeń ńłch'i'í bijoos n deego deeyolgo, koͅoͅí, doobeeshigoda'iͅiͅłdago, daadiiłtłáná'a. Kát'égo, koͅoͅ gooslíͅná'a. Then, that Coyote having been helped by the blowing of the wind, the fire, becoming impossible to control, burned on. In this way, fire came into existence. 2 Then [the Flies] hated that Coyote. (10.9) 'Ákoo 'áń Ma'yeń k'eedaashn n dii. 'Ákoo 'ádaałji n díná'a: "Tséí, n diií, tóí: diik'eh biłnoodółaha !" daabiłji n díná'a. 'Áí dá'ághádzaaná'a. Then [the Flies] hated that Coyote. And they spoke thus to him: "The stones, the earth, the water: let them all become hot for him!" they said to him. That happened exactly so. Then he was dashing around and around. (10.10) 'Ákoo naanájinagoná'a. Ma'yeń 'át'íͅná'a. Díídíí dík'eh gołndoo. 'Íbaͅaͅ ch'éda'ijiłgheená'a. Tó sikáͅná'a. Then he was dashing around and around. The Coyote did so. All of these became hot for him. Therefore he ran away in vain. A [pond of] water lay there. "This, also, used to be cool." (10.11) "Díí, 'iłdóͅ, sik'asłeͅeͅ." ji n díná'a. 'Ákoo tósikáͅí bigheezhiͅ yaanájiiłghoná'a. Nł'ádaists'áͅná'a. Dá'ákaa, jiisbéézhná'a. "This, also, used to be cool." he said. And he jumped into the water that lay there. A [hissing] noise was heard. Right there, he was boiled. At this time, anything that they said occurred in exactly that way. (10.12) Díídíí 'ádáͅ, dáha'yá yádaajiłtií 'áí dá'ákaa 'ágot'éná'a. Dáyáada: "'Ágo n dá" ji n díí, dá'ágháha n dííłná'a. 'Áíbee doodá'ákoyáhaańbich'iͅiͅyá jiłtidaná'a. Dáhaań k'eeshn n diińná 'ághát'égo bich'iͅiͅyájiłtií, 'áń dá'ákaa 'áha n dííłná'a. 'Áíbaͅaͅ doodá'ákodéyáhaańbich'iͅiͅyájiłtidaná'a. Dágózhóͅgoná yádaajiłtiná'a. At this time, anything that they said occurred in exactly that way. Anything of which one said: "It is to happen so." happened in just that way. For that reason one did not say just anything to someone. If one spoke in that way to someone one hated, it happened in exactly that way. For that reason, one did not say just anything to someone. 3 They spoke only in a very good way. Then, it having happened so in this place, fire came into existence. (10.13) 'Ákoo, dzaͅaͅshíͅ kágodzaago, koͅoͅgooslíͅná'a. Ma'yeń 'áń bik'ehgo koͅoͅ gooslíͅná'a, daaji n dí. Kát'égo, n dé yaadaagooł n dí 'iłk'idáͅne. Then, it having happened so in this place, fire came into existence. Because of Coyote, fire came into existence, they say. In this way, the old people have told them about it. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (10.1) Linguistic Notes 1. yá'édiͅná'a 'there was none, it is said'. yá - is an intensifier; 'édiͅ , the 3rd person of 'é -...- diͅ 'to be none' [imp. neut. intr.]. 'é - thematic prefix. 2. tł'ízhe 'flies, houseflies'. 3. bikoͅ' 'ólíná'a 'they had fire, it is said'. It seems clear that this is a mishearing of bikoͅ' gólíͅná'a 'their fire existed, it is said'. (10.2) Linguistic Notes 1. gotál yiis'áͅná'a 'they held a ceremony, it is said'. gotál 'ceremony'. yiis'áͅ , 3rd person with 3rd person obj. of - ł - 'áͅ 'to have a round object in position' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. The "round object" is, in this case, the ceremony. 2. mai 'coyote'. A:variant form: ma'yee. See note 5.1, §3. 3. tsínáiłgoná'a 'he continuously poked it in the fire, it is said'. 3rd person iter. with 3rd person obj. of tsí -|...[si- perf.]- ł -gee 'to poke into a fire' [act. tr.; tsí -| 'in a fire'].

(10.5) Linguistic Notes 1. nandaajíńt'i 'they circled about him'. 3a distrib. perf. of nan-ni-...[ni- perf.]- té 'to line up, to form a line [around]' [act. intr.]. Cf. linguistic note to Chiricahua text .8, §3. 2. kaiłyaanáałghoná'a 'he jumped away from them with it, it is said'. kaił - &gt; kaa- 'from them' plus yił - 'with it'. yaanáałgho , 3rd person perf. of yaa- ná -|...[ni- perf.]-l-ghee 'to jump' [act. intr.]. yaaná -| ? ; the theme alone means 'to move'. 3. 'iładaashdeeskaná'a 'they ran, it.is said' 3a distrib. perf. of 'iła -di-...[si- perf.]- ká 'several run' [act. intr.]. 'iła - ?; di- inceptive [?]. The theme alone: 'several move'.

Cf. note 10.2, §3. 3. daagodeek'aͅaͅná'a 'fire was burning, it is said'. 3rd persbn distrib. with place subj. of dee-|...[si- perf.]- kaͅaͅ 'to burn [of a forest fire]' [act. intr.]. de-|, also heard di-| and di-, and sometimes occurring with hi- perf. is the prefix referring to fire [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 2.7, §8]. (10.7) Linguistic Notes 1. daayinłtséés 'they tried to put it out'. 3rd person distrib. with 3rd person obj. of ni...[si- perf.]- ł - tséés 'to put out a fire' [act. tr.; ni- terminative]. 2. ch'éda'ádaayóół'iͅiͅná'a 'they tried in vain, it is said'. ch'éda - 'in vain' plus 3rd person distrib. perf. with 3rd person obj. of 'á -...[hi- perf.]- ł - 'íͅ 'to do to, to treat' [act. tr.; 'á - 'so'].

Cf. note 6.8, §2. 2. deeyolgo 'it having started to blow'. 3rd person perf. of di-...[si- perf.]- yooł 'to blow' [act. intr.]. 3. doobeeshigoda'iͅiͅłdago 'being impossible to control'. Except for the obvious negative and subordinating affixes, I cannot analyze this form. 4. daadiiłtłáná'a 'it burned on, it is said'. 3rd person distrib. imp. of di-|...[ni- perf.]- ł - tłá 'to burn' [act. intr.; di-| referring to fire]. (10.9) Linguistic Notes 1. k'eedaashn n dii 'they hated him' . 3a person distrib. of k'ee-di-ni-...- n dii 'to hate' [imp. neut. intr.]. Cf. di-ni-...- n dii 'to be hurt, pained' [imp. neut. intr.].

(10.10) Linguistic Notes naanájinagoná'a 'he was dashing around and around, it is said'. 3a person prog. of -gee 'to rush, dash' with prefixes naaná -ni-. naaná - evidently means 'around and around' [see linguistic note to Chirichau text 2.32, §2] but ni- is uncertain. (10.11) Linguistic Notes 1. sik'asłee 'it used to be cool'. sik'as 'it is cool, cold' [3rd person si- perf. neut. intr.]; - łee 'it used to be' [encl.][appears as - łeͅeͅ in the text- MEC]. 2. nł'ádaists'áͅná'a 'a noise was heard, it is said'. Distrib. perf. of 0- ł - 'á -yi-...[si- perf.]- ł -ts'a noise is heard from somewhere' [act. intr.; cf. linguistic note to Chiricahua text 4.8, §5]. The text form means 'noises were heard of you' [ni- 'you'; - ł 'with, of becoming nł -]. This seems incorrect; perhaps the form should read bił'ádaists'áͅná'a 'noises were heard of him, it is said'. (10.12) Linguistic Notes doodá'ákoyáhaańbich'iͅiͅyájiłtidaná'a 'one did not say just anything to someone, it is said'. dá'ákoyá 'just anything' [ dá - 'just']; haań 'someone, anyone'; bich'iͅiͅ 'to them'; yájiłti 3a person imp. of yá -...[hi- perf.]- ł -ti 'to speak' [act. intr.; yá - thematic]. The form doodá'ákodéyáhaańbich'iͅiͅyájiłtidaná'a with the same meaning in line six of this passage of text is the same as the above except that dá'ákodéyá 'just anything' has replaced dá'ákoyá . Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 Texts 10 through 18 are episodes belonging to the familiar coyote trickster cycle. Among the Chiricahua these stories were told as a connected series of episodes having a definite order. They were told at night and in the winter only. The story of the creation of the plant and animal life of earth is not introduced into the Chiricahua coyote cycle as it is in the Mescalero narrative. [See note 1. 1 in section A.] Ethnological Note 2 The winning of fire for man is always attributed to Coyote by the Chiricahua. The identities of those from whom he steals it and of those who aid him in the theft differ in various versions. Ethnological Note 3 The informant might have added that the same belief governs Apache behavior today. If an Apache curses and wishes ill to another shortly before some disaster occurs to the one upon whom the malediction falls, the person who spoke so rashly will be considered a "witch" by many and may find himself in serious trouble.</field>
