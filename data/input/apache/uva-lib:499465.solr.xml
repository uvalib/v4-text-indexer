Tséntsaaí si'áͅí yaahíłghoná'a. Łi' 'áałji n diná'a: "'Aaí tsé naagháí 'át'é." biłji n diná'a. He was going [along] a road again. He came to a big Rock that was lying there. Someone spoke thus to him: "That is a Rock that moves about." he said to him. "So? Where is there a Rock that moves about!" (14.2) "'Iyáahee? Haaee tsé naagháná !" gooł n diná'a. "So? Where is there a Rock that moves about!" [Coyote] said to him. "Do not defecate on that Rock." (14.3) "'Aaí tséí dook'ejichiͅiͅda." biłji n diná'a. "Do not defecate on that Rock." he said to [Coyote]. Then he spoke thus: (14.4) Nágo 'á n diná'a: "'Iyáahee? Haaee tsé naagháná !" n digo Tséí hik'eeschaͅaͅná'a. Then he spoke thus: "So? Where is there a Rock that moves!" he said [and] defecated on the Rock. Then he went over yonder. (14.5) Nágo gháhách'éłghoná'a. Tsé bike'ch'éńmáázná'a. Yaanádiiłghoná'a. Dábikétsínee homasná'a. Dásíbindzileí yeenádaadiiłghoná'a. Dá'ághát'éndah, Tséí dábikétsínee homasná'a. Then he went over yonder. The Rock rolled out after him. He ran from it. It rolled along right at his heels. He ran with all his strength. In spite of that, the Rock rolled along right at his heels. Then Coyote spoke thus: (14.6) Nágo Ma'yeí 'á n diná'a: "Dásíshihátideí beenádiishghodáͅ danshóͅóͅ'íͅná?" Tséí yiił n diná'a Then Coyote spoke thus: "Did you ever see me when I was running at my very best speed?" he said to the Rock. Then he ran with his very best speed. (14.7) Nágo dásí'itisgo yeehiiłtií yeenádiiłghoná'a. Dá'ághát'éndah, Tséí dábikétsínee homasná'a. Then he ran with his very best speed. In spite of that, the Rock rolled along right at his heels. Then [Coyote] ran from him into a hole. (14.8) Nágo 'ii'áńyá yaa'áhołghoná'a. Tséí 'ii'ání bidádéńmáázná'a. Tséí 'ábiił n diiná'a: "Díídíí, haͅh shánáł n daa !" biił n diná'a. Then [Coyote] ran from him into a hole. The Rock rolled to cover [the entrance to] the hole. The Rock spoke thus to him: "This, lick it off for me quickly!" he said to him Then Coyote licked it all off for him. (14.9) Nágo Ma'yeí díík'eh kánáyóół n dááná'a. 'Ákoo Tséí si'áͅnyá nnáńmáázná'a. Then Coyote licked it all off for him. And the Rock rolled back to where it had been before. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (14.1) Linguistic Notes náánóołghołná'a 'he was going along again'. 3rd person prog. of nááná -...[si- perf.]-l-ghee 'to go again' [act. intr.; nááná - 'again']. See note 13.7. (14.3) Linguistic Notes dook'ejichiͅiͅda 'do not defecate on it'. 3rd person imp. of k'e-...[si- perf.]- chiͅiͅ 'to defecate on'. 'k'e- is probably. cognate with the pp. -k'i [also heard -k'e 'on, upon'. In this verb, however, it is not preceded by a pronoun object except in the third person and has lost the inherent tone characteristic of the independent postposition [see, for example, ' k'é - chiͅiͅ 'you defecate on it']. Since the theme - chiͅiͅ 'to defecate' is intransitive, the verb k'e-...- chiͅiͅ 'to defecate on', which is apparently transitive, is probably derived from an earlier form *0-k'i-...- chiͅiͅ . (14.4) Linguistic Notes hik'eeschaͅaͅná'a 'he defecated on it'. 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of k'e-...[si- perf.]- chiͅiͅ 'to defecate on'. See note 14.3. (14.5) Linguistic Notes 1. gháhách'éłghoná'a 'he went over yonder'. gháhá 'over yonder' is the demonstr. stem gháh - plus the pp. - yá [see Grammatical Sketch, §3]. ch'éłgho , 3rd person perf. of ch'é -ni-...[ni- perf.]-l-ghee 'to go out' [act. intr.; ch'é - 'out'; ni- completive]. See note 13.7. 2. bike'ch'éńmáázná'a 'it rolled out after him'. bike'- 'after him' plus 3rd person perf. of ch'é -ni- ...[ni- perf.]- mááz 'to roll out' [act. intr.]. Cf. §1, above. The third person ni- perf. of the verb in §1 differs from this one because it is an -l- class verb. 3. dábikétsínee 'right at his heels'. dá - 'just'; bi- 'his'; kétsín 'ankles' [see note 13.6, §2]; -ee 'at'. 4. homasná'a 'it rolled along'. 3rd person prog: of - máás 'to roll' [act. intr.]. The verb theme without derivational prefixes is found only in the progressive mode. 5. dásíbindzileí 'that which is all his strength'. dásí - 'very'; -ndzile 'strength, power'. 6. yeenádaadiiłghoná'a 'he ran with it'. 3rd person distrib. perf. of 0 ee - ná -di-|...[ni- perf.]-l-ghee 'to run by means of it' [act. intr.; see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 5.6, §6]. Note that 'the distrib. 3rd persen is used when it is quite clear from the context that a single actor is being referred to. The distributive prefix probably functions here as an adverb and therefore the form should be translated 'he ran very [fast] by means of it'. (14.6) Linguistic Notes 1. dásíshihátideí 'my very best speed'. - hátide 'best speed, full speed'. 2. danshóͅóͅ'íͅná 'did you ever see me?'. dan- interrog. procl. [cf. da- interrog. procl. in note 13.1]. shóͅóͅ'íͅ , 2nd person with 1st person obj. of - 'íͅ 'to see' [prog. neut. tr.]. (14.8) Linguistic Notes 1. bidádéńmáázná'a 'it rolled to cover it'. bidá 'its top, its cover, over it'. I cannot analyze '- déńmááz It seems to be a 3rd person ni- perf. of the theme - mááz 'to roll' [act. intr.] with the prefixes di-ni- but I have not a conjugation complete enough to verify this. 2. shánáł n daa 'lick it off for me'. 2nd person imp. of 0 á - ná -...[hi- perf.]- ł - n daa 'to lick clean for someone' [act. tr.]. á - 'for'; ná - 'off [to lick] clean'; cf ...[hi- perf.]- ł - n daa 'to lick' [act. tr.] . (14.9) Linguistic Notes nnáńmáázná'a 'he rolled back'. 3rd person perf. of ni- ná -ni-...[ni- perf.]-d- máás 'to roll back' [act. intr.]. ni- 'to a stop'; ná - 'back'; ni- completive. See note 14.5, §§ 2, 4.</field>
