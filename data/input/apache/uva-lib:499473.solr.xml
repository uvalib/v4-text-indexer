This narrative is from a member of the Warm Springs band of the Chiricahua. It may be, therefore, that these are dialectical variants. 2. beená'iistł'óͅ 'in a cradle'. Literally: 'it had been wrapped around it'. A passive perf. of the theme - tł'óͅ 'to tie up, to wrap' with the prefixes ee- 'by means of'; ná - 'around' and 'i- indef. pronoun. (22.2) Linguistic Notes yik'éjíńdzíͅíͅs 'he tore it open'. 3rd person perf. of 0- k'é -ji-ni-...[ni- perf.]- dzíͅíͅs 'to tear open' [act. intr.]. k'é - 'off, open' ji- ?; ni- completive [?]. (22.3) Linguistic Notes 1. Note, in the second line, that the object precedes the subject; i. e., ts'aał 'cradle', the object of yóótaͅ he took hold of it' precedes shashí 'the bear'. Cf. the line preceding. 2. tséyeehayóółhaal 'he struck a rock with it'. tsé 'rock'. yee- 'with it' plus the 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of ha-|...[hi- perf.]- ł - ghaał 'to strike' [act. tr.].

Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 When Chiricahua are conducted into the mountain interiors, into the homes of the Mountain Spirits, it is usually the Gray One or clown who acts as a guide for them. Ethnological Note 2 From here on, the informant tells the story in the first person. Ethnological Note 3 That is, this is the bear who killed the woman, their mother, and her baby. Ethnological Note 4 This incident is supposed to have occurred at the time the Warm Springs band of the Chiricahua Apache were being removed from their New Mexico home to Arizona. Later they were allowed to return to the vicinity of Warm Springs once more and these two children were united with their relatives.</field>
