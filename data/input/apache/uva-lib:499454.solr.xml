(3.1) K'adi Náa'tsíliibi n dáayee'igháͅáͅ'í, n dé doobáńgólaadaná'aí, gólíͅná'a. Now the Bull who killed with his eyes, he who did not permit people to live, existed. Then Child of the Water spoke thus to his mother: (3.2) `Ákoo Tóbájishchinéń bimáń `áyiił n díná'a. "Shimá, k'adi `ághahyá Náa'tsíli bi n dáayee'ígháͅáͅ'í naagháí bich'iͅiͅdiyéshdzá." gooł n díná'a. `Ákoo hich'iͅiͅ'ihaadzáná'a. Then Child of the Water spoke thus to his mother: "My mother, now I'm going over there where lives the Bull who kills with his eyes." he said to her. And then he went off to him. That Bull lay where one could not approach him [unseen] from any direction. (3.3) `Áí náa'tsílií dooha'shíͅ baajóya'le'át'édashíͅ sitíͅná'a. Dádziłgashíͅ `Iłch'áͅgo dees'íͅgo sitíͅná'a. That Bull lay where one could not approach him [unseen] from any direction. He lay right in a plain looking in all directions. [Child of the Water] stopped, facing him from a hiding place. (3.4) Haná'anshíͅ bich'iͅnjíńyáná'a. `Áshíͅ jiisdáná'ago `a'ááłná'a. "Ha'gohee `aaí náa'tsílií sishxéná?" jíńziͅgo jichago jiisdáná'a. [Child of the Water] stopped, facing him from a hiding place. There he sat for some time. "How can I kill that Bull?" he thought as he sat weeping. Then, suddenly, a Gopher came to him. (3.5) Nágo, dáhágoh n dii, łíghe'naa'i n dilé kaahíłghoná'a. "'Iyáabaͅaͅ nchago síndá?" gooł n díná'a. Then, suddenly, a Gopher came to him. "Why do you sit there weeping?" he said to him. Then Child of the Water spoke thus: (3.6) Nágo, Tóbájishchinéń `á n díná'a: "'Aaí Náa'tsílií bi n dáayee'igháͅáͅ'í n dé doobáńgólaadaí ha'yágoda ła' hishłáá sishxé ńsiͅ`í; dooha'yágo ła' hoshłá hát'édaí bigee hishcha." yiił n díná'a. Then Child of the Water spoke thus: "I want in some way to kill that Bull who kills with his eyes [and] who will not permit people to live; I weep because there is no way in which I can do it." he said to him. Then the Gopher spoke thus to Child of the Water: (3.7) Nágo łíghe'naa'i' n diléí Tóbájiishchinéń `áyiiłndíná'a: "'Íyaͅaͅń díͅíͅn 'iłdagé `ń'áńgo dásí bijéí si'áͅí `ázhiͅ náha'ish n dííł.

Then the Gopher spoke thus to Child of the Water: "Well, I'll dig for you four tunnels above one another and leading directly to his heart. Then, just as I give you the word, you run into this topmost tunnel. Then, when you get over there, his heart will be beating right there. 1 Then, when you have shot [your arrow] right in the center of his heart, run into the lowest tunnel." he said to him. He advised him well. Then: (3.8) `Ákogo: "K'adi, `haͅ'áł`íͅ ! Koyá `nłghee ! Dá'ánłdish n díí dík'eh dá'ákaayá !" `á n diléí goołndíná'a. Then: "Now hurry up! Run in right here! Do everything I have told you in just that Way!" said the Gopher to him. Then Child of the Water: (3.9) Nágo Tóbájiishchinéń: "'Áhaͅh, dá'ákaa." goołndíná'a. Then Child of the Water: "All right, [I'll do] just so." he said to him. Then he entered the topmost tunnel. (3.10) Nágo `idáhégo `ń'áńí `oołghoná'a. Náa'tsíliní sitíͅí dásíbitł`áshíͅ njíłghoná'a.

He stopped right under where the Bull was lying. And right there his heart was beating. He shot [an arrow] right into the center of it. Then he ran away from him. He ran into the very lowest tunnel. The Bull was plowing the tunnels up with his horns. (3.11) Náa'tsíliní bideeí `ń'áńní `ákaa yeenaanágadzíͅíͅsná'a. Táán `iłdagé `ń'áńní díík'eh nais n dilná'a.

Finally, he started to tear up the fourth tunnel also. He fell dead just as he [came] close to where [Child of the Water] lay. Then he had also killed this one who would not permit people to live. (3.12) `Ákoo díídíí `iłdóͅ n dé doobáńgólaadaí náájiyeesxíͅná'a. Then he had also killed this one who would not permit people to live. Then Child of the Water returned to his mother. (3.13) `Ákoo Tóbájiishchinéń bimáń yaanádzáná'a. "Náa'tsíli bi n dáayee'igháͅáͅ'ní náázéłhíͅ." yiił n díná'a. Then Child of the Water returned to his mother. "I have also killed the Bull who kills with his eyes." he said to her. Then White Painted Woman, feeling very happy [and] saying, (3.14) Nágo Isdzánádleeshéń, `iłéńziͅgo "'Ihéhee !" n dígo, naaná'azhishná'a. Then White Painted Woman, feeling very happy [and] saying, "That is good!" danced around and around. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (3.1) Linguistic Notes 1.

Relative enclitic í ; for analysis of verb, see note 1.5, §4. (3.2) Linguistic Notes 1. naagháí 'that he lives'. naaghá 'he goes about here and there' [see note 1.6, §1] also means 'he lives'. - í relative. 2. bich'iͅiͅdiyéshdzá 'I'm going to him'. ch' iͅ 'to, toward' [pp.]. diyéshdzá , 1st person perf. of di-yi-|...[si- perf]-d á 'one starts off' [act. intr.]. -d á, -d- form of -y á 'one moves' [act. intr.; see note 1.15, §2].

'át'é , 3rd person of ' á -ni-...- t'é 'to be so' [imp. neut. intr.]. 2. sitíͅná'a 'he lay, it is said'. 3rd person of - tíͅ 'an animate object lies' [si- perf., neut. intr.]. 3. dádziłgashíͅ 'right in a plain'. dádziłga plain, clearing'; cf. gołga 'plain, clearing' and łi -ni-...-ga 'to be white' [imp. neut. intr.; ł ini- adj.]. [what Hoijer translates here as 'white' also can have the meaning: 'clear', 'transparent'--MEC] 4. iłch'áͅgo 'in all directions'. - ch'áͅ 'away from' [pp.]; 'i ł reciprocal: -go subordinating. Literally: 'being from one another'. This line is better translated: "he lay looking in all directions from a clearing." (3.4) Linguistic Notes 1. haná'an 'hiding place, out of sight' [part.]; - shíͅ 'from' [pp.]. 2. bich'iͅnjíńyáná'a 'he stopped facing him, it is said'. bich'iͅiͅ - 'toward him, facing him'. njíńyá, 3a person perf. of ni-ni-...[ni- perf.]- yá one stops moving' [act. intr.]. ni- 'to a stop'; ni- completive. 3. jiisdáná'ago 'he, sitting, it is said'. j iisdá , 3a person of -d á 'one sits' [si- perf. neut. intr.]; - ná'a narrative encl.; -go subordinating encl. The narrative enclitic is not usually suffixed to subordinated verbs [see note 1, §3]. 4. 'a'ááłná'a [the sun] was moving, it is said. 'a- &gt; 'i- indefinite pronoun plus the 3rd person prog. prefix haa-. -' ááł, prog.stem of - 'aa 'a round object moves' [act. intr.]. Literally: 'some round object is moving', an idiomatic expression for 'the sun is moving, time is passing'. Thus, the line reads: 'he, sitting there, time is passing', which is the Apache way of expressing 'he sat there for some time'. 5. h a'gohee 'how', a combination of ha'- interrog. stem, -go subord. encl., and hee interrogative encl . 6. 'aaí 'that', the demonstr. stem 'aa- plus the relative enclitic - í See Grammatical Sketch, §3. 7. sishxéná 'I shall kill him!'. sishxé, first person imp. of si- [si- perf.]- ł - ghé 'to kill one' [act. tr.]. The first person pronoun sh- and the classifier ł - combine, and the initial consonant of the stem assimilates to this combination in voice. -n á emphatic enclitic. (3.5) Linguistic Notes 1. dáhágoh n dii 'suddenly' [part.] 2. łighe'naa'i n dilé 'gopher'. łí - 'ground' [in compounds and as a verb prefix]; ghe' 'inside' [pp.]; naa'i n dil, 3rd person cont. imp. with indefinite obj. of naa-|...[si- perf.]- n dííł 'to tear up, to scatter about' [act.tr.]; - é relative.

This verb theme is one of the few which always have the -l- class. (3.6) Linguistic Notes The part of this passage within the quotation marks may be analyzed as follows: 'aaí Náa'tsílłí bi n dáayeełgháͅáͅ'í n dé doobáńgólaadaí 'that Bull who kills with his eyes [and] who does not permit people to live' is the object of sishxé 'I'll kill him'. ha'yágoda 'in some way' modifies hishłá 'I'll do it' and ła' 'that' is the direct object of hishłá . Thus, 'I'll do that [referring to the killing] in some way'. In ńsł'í 'that which I wish', 'that which' refers back to the statement 'I'll kill the Bull who kills with his eyes [and] who does not permit people to live [by] my doings of some nature'. Therefore, the whole phrase may be translated: "that which I want [is to] kill the Bull who..." dooha'yágo ła' hoshłá hát'édaídéͅ is a relative form of the negative of ha'yágo 'in some way', ła' 'that', hoshłá 'I want to do it' [opt.], and hát'é 'it is possible, it can be done'. Thus: 'that which it is not possible [that] I do in some way'. bigee 'because of it', 'it' referring to the phrase analyzed above; hishcha 'I weep'. Therefore: 'I weep because of that which it is not possible [that] I do in some way'. (3.7) Linguistic Notes 1. 'íyaͅaͅ 'for that reason, therefore'; - ń ? 2.
