The Old Woman's Grandson 1 as told by Duncan Belacho Long ago, near the time when the earth had been made, (38.1) 'Iłk'idáͅ, n di'ágojílaaí 'áháánédáͅ, sáͅná'ań bichóná'ań 'icheeshkéná'ań dá'áko yiłnaa'aashná'a. 'Ákoo kiͅsijaaná'a. 'Áee yiłń'áázhná'a. 'Itéjisiinéná'a. Long ago, near the time when the earth had been made, An old woman traveled about alone with her daughter's child, a boy. And the two of them came to a town. They were very poor. Then this old woman went into the town. (38.2) 'Ákoo díń sáͅń kiní 'ighe'yá 'oołghoná'a. 'Ákaa 'i n daa yátá'dił'eełná'a. Naakizháálí hiyaałbiͅiͅłná'a, łi' jíͅgo. Naakizháálí náyíń'áͅná'a. Then this old woman went into the town. There she washed for the white people. She earned twenty five cents that day. She brought the twenty five cents back [home]. Then she gave it to her grandson. (38.3) 'Ákoo bichóń yaayíń'áͅná'a. "Kiͅyá ń n dá. Báń naahíł n dii." yiił n diná'a. Then she gave it to her grandson. "Go to town. Buy some bread." she said to him. Then he went there. (38.4) 'Ákoo 'ákaa 'oołghoná'a. Chíͅ'báyahá 'áhołghoná'a. Dooháń 'á'sidádaná'a. 'Ákoo kéjaabizáͅáͅyéí dzaͅaͅshíͅ sitíͅná'a. 'Ábiił n díná'a: "Naashíł n dii." kéjaaí biił n diná'a. Then he went there. He went into the store. No one was there. But a little dog lay there. He spoke thus to him: "Buy me." the dog said to him. Then the white storekeeper returned. (38.5) 'Ákoo 'i n daań 'i n daań baanaa'i n diiń náłghoná'a. 'Ákoo: "Díí kéjaaí naanaahish n dii." yiił n diná'a. Then the white storekeeper returned. Then: "I'll buy this dog from you." he said to him. Then he gave him the twenty five cents and [the storekeeper] gave him [the dog]. (38.6) 'Ákoo naakizháálí yaayíń'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo bayíńłtíͅná'a.

He took it back home to his grandmother. Then his grandmother spoke thus to him: 'Buy bread.' I told you. Then, the next day, that old woman washed for the white people again. (38.7) 'Áshíͅ, hiiskáͅgo, 'áń sáͅń 'i n daa yátánáádił'eełná'a. 'Ákoo naakizháálí náyíń'áͅná'a. Bichóń yaanááyíń'áͅná'a. "Báń naahił n dii." náábiił n díná'a. Then, the next day, that old woman washed for the white people again. And she brought the twenty five cents back [home]. She again gave it to her grandson. "Buy bread." she said to him again. Then the boy went to the store again. (38.8) 'Ákoo 'icheeshkéń cjíͅ'báyahá 'ináánóołghoná'a. Kéjaabizáͅáͅí: "Náánaashíł n dii." biił n díná'a. Náánaayees n diiná'a. Then the boy went to the store again. The little dog: "Buy me also." he said to him. He bought him also. Then: (38.9) 'Ákoo: "K'adi kiͅ'ízisí bighee'yá ła'ń 'i n daazhíígoń bich'iͅiͅń n dá." iił n díná'a. Then: "Now go to a certain rich white man in the big town," he said to him.

I will bring that back to you. Give me the ring that you are wearing." the boy said. Then this white man: (38.11) 'Ákoo díń 'i n daań: "Doo'iyáashiłnzhóͅíshaaha'oot'iͅiͅda." n diná'a.

Then this white man spoke thus: "Long ago, a good boy was taken away from me; but him you cannot return to me," this white man said. Then the boy: (38.14) 'Ákoo 'icheeshkéń: "Díík'ehá naanánshtee." n diná'a. Then the boy: "I can certainly bring him back to you." he said. Then the white man: (38.15) 'Ákoo 'i n daań: "Bééso łáͅgo nanshjáásh. 'Ákoo shaanáńłtee." n diná'a. Then the white man: "I will give you much money. Then you bring him back to me." he said. Then the boy: (38.16) 'Ákoo 'icheeshkéń: "Gostsahí dá'áíná shań'aa. 'Ákoo naanánshtee." n diná'a. Then the boy: "Give me just the ring. Then I'll bring him back to you." he said. Then this white man: (38.17) 'Ákoo díń 'i n daań: "Gostsahí doodaólá'át'éda? béésoí łáͅgo nanshjáásh. Akoo shaanánłtee." Then this white man: "What can you with the ring? I will give you much money. Then you bring him back to me." Then the boy: (38.18) 'Ákoo 'icheeshkéń: "Gostsahí shań'aa." n diná'a. Then the boy: "Give me the ring," he said. Then he gave him the ring.

Then the dog spoke to him: "Put that ring on your pillow when you lie down tonight. Then: 'May I awake lying in a beautiful house. And may my grandmother awake being young again,' say to the ring. Then it will happen just so." he said to him. The little dog spoke thus to him. Then this boy: (38.20) 'Ákoo 'ádíń 'icheeshkéń: "'Ádzaͅaͅee kiͅiͅ'ízisí bighe'ee n dézhíígoń biyách'ee'ń biłsisjoolgo ch'ínóoshdzí." n diná'a.

Then he awoke lying with the daughter of the rich man. Whatever he said to the ring happened so. "May I awake rich." he said. And it happened so. Then this girl learned about the ring.

Then this girl took the ring. Then she put it on her pillow. And the girl spoke thus: "May I awake on an island lying in the ocean," she said. And it happened so. Then the ring had been lost to this boy. (38.23) 'Ákoo díń 'icheeshkéń gostsah baaha'oołtoͅná'a. 'Ákoo 'ádíń n n dézhíígoń bégoosiͅiͅná'a. 'Ákoo: "Gostsahí'a?" biił n díná'a. Then the ring had been lost to this boy. And this rich man found out about it. Then: "Where is the ring?" he said to him. The boy: (38.24) 'Icheeshkéń: "Shaaha'oołtoͅ." n díná'a. The boy: "It has been lost to me." he said. Then: (38.25) 'Ákoo: "Díͅíͅ' hiiskáͅzhiͅ gotsahí nán'aa." biił n diná'a. "T'óonán'áͅdago, 'áń ńtee béshts'aaí bighe'yá.

"If you do not find it, you will be put in an iron pot. So search for the ring four days. If you find it, I'll do nothing to you," he said to the boy. Then [the boy] said to both the little dogs: (38.26) 'Ákoo kéjaabizáͅáͅyéí dá'iłk'eh: "Gostsahí hádahaał." yiił n diná'a. Then [the boy] said to both the little dogs: "Look for the ring." Then both the little dogs went to every place that the white men lived on the earth but they did not find it. (38.27) 'Ákoo kéjaabizáͅáͅyéí dá'iłk'eh n dibikáee 'i n daa daagólíní díík'een 'iłha'oołghoná'a. Ndah t'óonáin'áͅdan'á'a. Then both the little dogs went to every place that the white men lived on the earth but they did not find it. Then only one day had passed. (38.28) 'Ákoo dáłee'é hiiskáͅná'a.

And this man stood in a big iron pot. His feet were tied up in the water. And he was pumping out the water. And, if he does not pump out the water, he will drown. Then [to] the little dogs: (38.29) 'Ákoo kéjaabizáͅáͅyéí: "Nchó baanánaht'aash. Báń nahá'ágolá. 'Ákoo gostsahí hánáádahgaał." díń n déń n diná'a. Then [to] the little dogs: "Go back to your grandmother. She will make bread for you. Then search for the ring again." this man said. Then the dogs searched for the ring for four days. (38.30) 'Ákoo kéjaaí gostsahí háyintágo díͅíͅ' hiskáͅná'a. Then the dogs searched for the ring for four days. Then, on the shore of the ocean, there were some Frog soldiers. (38.31) 'Ákoo tóhíga'í tábaͅaͅyá, Chíͅ'nshtłodé siláádo sijaaná'a. 'Ákaa kéjaaí gostsahí yé'ijiłkiná'a. Then, on the shore of the ocean, there were some Frog soldiers. There the dogs asked about the ring. Then one of them spoke thus: (38.32) 'Ákoo łi' 'á n diná'a: "'Ákaa n dáséyá, dooha'dáͅkiͅdaní, 'ákaa łi' kiͅ nzhóní si'áͅ." ła'ń n diná'a. Then one of them spoke thus: "Over yonder, where no house has ever been before, there is [now] a beautiful house." this one said. Then [to] the Frog chief: (38.33) 'Ákoo Chíͅ'nshtłodé yánantáń: "Siláádo shaa'ń n dííł. Biłhanannshká." yiił n diná'a. Then [to] the Frog chief: "Give me some soldiers. I'll go across with them." [the dog] said to him. Then he gave him some [soldiers]. (38.34) 'Ákoo baa'ń n dilná'a. 'Ákoo kiͅ nzhóní si'áͅí binájiist'iná'a. 'Ákoo Lóó'sts'oͅoͅsé siláádoí bijoos n deená'a.

And they surrounded the beautiful house that lay there. Then the Mouse soldiers helped them. This girl had locked up [the house]. Then the Frog [and] Mouse soldiers didn't know what to do. And they tried in vain to go through the keyhole of the door. Then the Black Ants came to them. (38.35) 'Ákoo Góoshzhiné baahíkaná'a. Góoshzhiné daanádéńtan ghá'ii'áńyá 'ighájíńzhoozhná'a. 'Ákoo 'á n dee daanádéńtan ghaháá'áílaaná'a. Then the Black Ants came to them. The Black Ants went through the keyhole of the door. And then they opened the door. Then the girl was asleep. (38.36) 'Ákoo 'it'éekéń 'ákaa 'iłhoshná'a. 'Ákoo, tsé'isk'eh bitł'áhyá, bikáyáda, díík'een Lóó'sts'oͅoͅséí Góoshzhinéíyił naanádaajizjoshná'a, gostsahí bíká. Then the girl was asleep. Then, under the bed, on top of it, [and] everywhere the Mice and Black Ants ran about [searching] for the ring. Then one of the Mice spoke thus: (38.37) 'Ákoo Lóó'sts'oͅoͅsé łi' 'á n díná'a.: "Chíílí shaanah'aa hóók'áͅí." Then one of the Mice spoke thus: "Give me some chili powder." Then he thrust his tail in it. (38.38) 'Ákoo bitseeí yéideeshiizhná'a. Go n diiyá yéisláná'a. 'Ákoo 'étoné jiislíͅná'a. 'Ákoo gostsahí goghe'shíͅ hahaataná'a. 'Ákoo kaahanájít'áͅná'a. Then he thrust his tail in it. And he put [his tail] against her face. Then she sneezed. Then the ring flew out from inside her. 2 And it was taken away from her. Then the two dogs ran off with the ring. (38.39) 'Ákoo kéjaaí gostsahí yił'iładeest'áázhná'a. Gogostsahí náyíń'áͅná'a. 'Ádíń n dézhíígoń baanájíń'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo gok'ená'óó'aná'a.

Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (38.1) Linguistic Notes 1. The first line of this passage is literally as follows; "Long ago / the earth which has been made / near that time / an old woman, it is said / her daughter's child, it is said / a boy, it is said / just so / she was going about with him, it is said." 2. kiͅsijaaná'a 'a town'. kiͅ , 'houses'; sijaa 'a mass or clump lies' [3rd person si- perf. neut. intr.]. Note, in the first line of passage 2, that kiní , the relative form of kiͅ is used alone to mean 'town'. 3. 'itéjisiinéná'a. 'they were very poor'. 3a person of 'ité - ...- ł - ziiné 'to be poverty-stricken' [imp. neut. intr.]. No further analysis. (38.2) Linguistic Notes 1. yátá'dił'eełná'a 'she washed for them'. yá - 'for them' plus the 3rd person imp. with indefinite object of tá -di-...[hi- perf.]- ł - 'eeł 'to wash' [act. tr.]. tá - 'in the water' [?]; di- ?. The theme alone: 'to cause to float, to cause to become wet'. 2. naakizháálí 'twenty five cents'. A compound of naaki 'two' and zháálí &gt; Spanish real plus the relative -i. 3. hiyaałbiͅiͅłná'a 'she earned it'. 3rd person prog. with 3rd person obj. of ho-| [or hi- |]...[si- perf.]- ł - biͅiͅ 'to win [a wager]' [act. tr.]. (38.3) Linguistic Notes báń 'bread' &gt; Spanish pan . (38.4) Linguistic Notes 1. chíͅ'báyahá 'to the store'. chíͅ' 'goods of all kinds' plus `bi- 3rd person pronoun; - áyah 'place for' and the postposition - yá . 2. kéjaabizáͅáͅyéí 'a little dog'. kéjaa 'dog', probably a compound of ké - 'toes' and the stem of the verb -jaa 'a mass or clump lies' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. bizáͅáͅyéí 'little' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text l.5, §7]. (38.5) Linguistic Notes baanaa'i n diiń 'storekeeper'. naa'i n dii 'it is bought, purchased', 3rd person imp. with prefixes naa-'i- . Cf. naahi-...[si- perf.]- n dii 'to be bought, purchased' [act. intr.]. The text form is literally: 'he from whom things are bought'. (38.9) Linguistic Notes 1. kiͅ'ízisí 'the big town'. kiͅ 'house, town' plus 'ízis 'big, superlative, chief'. 2. 'i n daazhíígoń 'a rich white man'. 'i n daa 'white man' plus zhíígo &gt; Spanish rico 'rich'. (38.10) Linguistic Notes gostsah naada'si'áͅí 'the ring that you are wearing'. gostsah 'ring'. naa- 'to you'; da'- 'on'; si'áͅí 'a round object lies' [3rd person si- perf. neat. intr.]; - í relative. (38.14) Linguistic Notes díík'ehá 'certainly'. 'all, every' plus the postposition - yá . (38.19) Linguistic Notes ntsiigháhá 'on your pillow'. - tsiighá 'pillow', a compound of -tsii 'head' and - ghá ?. Note that . ntsiighá plus - yá becomes ntsiigháhá which indicates a final -h on - ghá . This -h however, appears only when the form is followed by - yá . (38.20) Linguistic Notes 1. biyách'ee' 'his daughter'. - yách'ee' 'daughter'. Also - ch'ee' . 2. biłsisjoolgo 'lying with her'. bił - 'with her' plus the 1st person of -l- jool 'two persons lie' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. (38.21) Linguistic Notes zhííshgogo 'I, being rich', zhííshgo , 1st person of zhíí -...-go 'to be rich' [imp. neut. intr.]. This is an interesting example of how a borrowed word may be adapted to the formal structure of the borrowing language. The Chiricahua apparently borrowed the Spanish rico 'rich' pronouncing it zhíígo . But, since most Chiricahua adjectives are verbal in form [see Grammatical Sketch, part 13], zhíígo was treated as the 3rd person of a verb with prefix zhíí - and stem - go and therefore conjugable. The same thing has happened in the case of Spanish loco 'crazy' which has become Chiricahua ló -...- go 'to be crazy' [imp. neut. intr.]. (38.22) Linguistic Notes 1. tóhíga'í 'ocean'. tó 'water'; híga' -, bound form of híga 'there is a streak of whiteness' [ni- perf. neut. intr.; prefix hi-]. 2. n diibizáͅáͅí 'island'. Literally: 'land that is little'. (38.25) Linguistic Notes 1. t'óonán'áͅdago 'if you do not find it'. Literally: 'if you have not picked the round object up'. 2. 'áń ńtee 'you will be put in'. This phrase cannot be analyzed.
