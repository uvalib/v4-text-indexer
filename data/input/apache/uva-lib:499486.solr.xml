Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 The Chiricahua believe that an accident which takes place while riding horseback, or some grave misfortune in connection with horses may occur at the will of the horse involved as revenge for some neglect or ill-treatment suffered. In the ceremony to cure the injured, the co-operation of the horse is required. It is usually staked near the place where the ceremony is held and appeals are addressed to it, in song and prayer, to undo the damage that it has caused. The horse is usually led to the patient during the latter part of the rite and if it neighs or demonstrates any interest in the patient at this time, it is considered a fortunate sign and an indication that the animal is relenting and will permit the cure to take place. Ethnological Note 2 Chino is one of the informant's neighbors. The distance is about one hundred feet. Ethnological Note 3 That is, they removed the outer covering, leaving the bare poles.</field>
