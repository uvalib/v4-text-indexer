Bikooghaͅí biyeeshxashíͅ dahyeestł'óͅná'a. Baadaajiyeezhoozhná'a. Ch'édégoda 'ádailáná'a. There was a large encampment. One of them had brought back a horse. He had tied it up near his camp. They had come to him in a body. They didn't know what to do with him. He had been tied up where there was no grass. (26.2) Tł'oh yá'édiͅshíͅ daheestł'óͅná'a. 'Ákoo 'ádaa n diná'a: "'Iyáashiͅ yiyáͅshiͅ'?" daa n diná'a. Yátaa'óó n dilná'a. "Bátaa'ah n dííł ! daa n digo taa n dileí bich'iͅiͅnjíńkáͅná'a. Doinéł'íͅdaná'a.

Then they spoke thus: "What does he eat?" they said. They had made gravy for him. "Make gravy for him!" they said [and] put the gravy before him. He did not look at it. And he began to eat a bit of grass that stood up on the other side. Then they spoke thus: "He apparently eats that!" they said. Then one of them untied him. (26.3) Nágo łi'ń hik'e'óó'aná'a. Bíchíͅí 'iná'iist'iná'a. T'áͅyágoda hik'idahneesdáná'a. Noótł'izhná'a. Náánáłi'ńgo hik'izhiͅ dahnádiiłghoná'a. Naanáánóótł'izhná'a. Dáłáͅgo naabóó n dilná'a. Then one of them untied him. He put a rope around his nose. He sat on him backward. He fell off. Several others also got on him. They also fell off. Many were thrown off. Then a Mescalero who lived among them came there. (26.4) Nágo Mashgaléń bitanlíͅí 'aaee híłghoná'a. Łíní hik'izhiͅ dahdiiłghoná'a. Hanyaayá 'iłch'áͅgo ha'daajiistsasgo biłnádiiłghoná'a. 'Aa n dashíͅ náánádzaͅaͅzhiͅná'a. Then a Mescalero who lived among them came there. He jumped upon the horse. He rode him down a hill whipping him alternately on both sides. From a distance [he came] back again. Then they spoke thus: (26.5) Nágo 'ádaa n diná'a: "Joo n déí, bitsileshíͅ dáhóójaabédeesjiizhná'a !" daa n diná'a. Then they spoke thus: "Friends, apparently pitch has been rubbed on his anus!" they said. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (26.1) Linguistic Notes Ch'édégoda 'ádailáná'a. 'they didn't know what to do with him'. Literally: 'they did so to him in vain'. (26.2) Linguistic Notes 1. tł'oh yá'édiͅshíͅ 'where there was no grass'. tł'oh 'grass'. yá - 'absolutely' plus 'édiͅ 'there is none' and the postposition - shíͅ 'from'. 2. 'iyáashiͅ yiyáͅshiͅ 'what does he eat?'. 'iyáa 'what'; - shiͅ , interrog. encl. yiyáͅ , 3rd person imp. with 3rd person obj. of ...[hi- perf.]- yáͅ 'to eat' [act. tr.]. 3. yátaa'óó n dilná'a 'they had made gravy for him'. yá - 'for him' plus 3rd person perf. of taa-'i-...[hi- perf.]- n dííł 'to make gravy'. taa- incorporated form of tó 'water' [?]; 'i- indef. obj. [?]; - n dííł 'to handle several objects'. In the next line of the text is found the 2nd person dual imp. of this verb. Cf. also - taa n dile 'gravy'. 4. bich'iͅiͅnjíńkáͅná'a / 'they put it before him'. bich'iͅiͅ / 'toward him' plus 3a person perf. of ni-ni- ...[ni- perf.]-kaa 'to put down something in a container' [act. tr.]. 5. 'ik'e'éńłchozhná'a. 'he began to eat'. Perf. of 'ik'ee-'i'ni-...[ni- perf.]- ł - chóósh 'to begin to eat a grass-like substance' [act. intr. ?]. The theme occurs only with this prefix complex. (26.3) Linguistic Notes 1. nágo łi'ń hik'e'óó'aná'a 'he untied him'. 3rd person perf. of k'e-'i- ...[hi- perf.]-'a 'to untie, to loosen' [act. intr. ?]. The pronoun before k'a- appears only in the 3rd person. The theme occurs only with this prefix complex. 2. bíchíͅí 'his nose'. - chíͅ 'nose' requires a high toned prefix. 3. 'iná'iist'iná'a 'he put a rope around it'. 3rd person perf. with indef. obj. of O- ná ...[si- perf.]- t'é 'to put a rope around' [act. tr.]. ná - 'around'. 4. hik'idahneesdáná'a. 'he sat on him'. hik'i `on him' plus the 3rd person perf. of dan-ni-...[si- perf.]- daa 'one sits down upon' [act. intr.; dah- 'upon'; ni- terminative]. 5. náánáłi'ńgo 'others also'. nááná - 'again, also'; łi' `one, the other'; - ń relative; -go subordinating. 6. dahnádiiłghoná'a 'they got on him'. 3rd person iter, of dah-di- |...[ni- perf.]-l- ghee 'to go up, to get on' [act. intr.; dah-di- | 'upward']. 7. naabóó n dilná'a 'they were thrown off'. perf. of naa-0-...[hi- perf.]- n dííł 'several are thrown off' [pass.; naa- 'off, down']. Here the theme - n dííł 'to handle several objects' is used to refer to several people. Note, too, that though this is a passive verb there is no sign of the -d- classifier [see Grammatical Sketch, §7]. (26.4) Linguistic Notes 1. The second and third lines of this passage are literally as follows: "Down [a hill] / away from each other / he whipping him / he ran with him. / From a distance / to here again". 2. ha'daajiistsasgo 'he, whipping him'. This is apparently a 3a person si- perf. form with a prefix complex ha-'i-daa- and a stem -tsas. Cf. ni- ...[si- perf.]- ł -tsis 'to whip' [act. tr.]. (26.5) Linguistic Notes 1. bitsileshíͅ 'on his anus'. - tsile 'anus'. 2. dáhóójaabédeesjiizhná'a / 'evidently pitch has been rubbed on it'. dáhóó -/ emphatic proclitic; jaa / 'pitch' plus 0 é -di-...[si- perf.]-jish 'something is rubbed on one' [pass.; é - 'against, on'; di- ?].</field>
