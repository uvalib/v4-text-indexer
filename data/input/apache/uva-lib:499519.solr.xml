Coyote spoke thus to his wife: "Make some food for me. When you have made some food and I have eaten, I will leave you again. They are asking for me over there at Turtle's camp." he said to his wife. His wife quickly went about preparing food for him. (4.2) Bi'isdzáńń dáhátide dáń báyaanaagháná'a. Dáhaͅhéná díík'eh bádáͅíͅlaaná'a. "K'adi 'íͅ n dáͅ." biił n diná'a, bi'isdzáńń.

She had roasted corn for him. She had put it down before him for him. He sat there eating. He was chewing roasted corn. He was chewing it fast. It was not fast enough for him. With roasted corn still in his mouth he rushed for the door. He coughed with the corn [in his mouth]. [The corn] flew down his throat. He tried in vain to speak. Then he vainly waved his arms to her. His mouth just hung open. He staggered. "Give me water!" he tried in vain to say. His wife rushed to him. She shook him. She slapped him on the back. Then the corn flew out of his mouth. He opened his eyes. He belched. He breathed again. He sat there angrily. (4.4) Biłgóͅtoͅgo neesdáná'a. 'Ódziiná'a. "Dáné ńtoͅ'é." n diná'a, "Nee'i n dáhásht'íͅn. Doo'iłtséshíͅłhédaí bíká nee'nyáͅda.

Farther on, he came out to a big lake. It was still early morning. Someone with big eyes was sitting facing him on the shore of the big lake. [Coyote] stopped before him. (4.14) Yich'iͅnńyáná'a.

See ńtoͅ'é 'you who are no good', a relative in - é of the 2nd person of this verb [line 2 of this passage]. 2. dáné 'food'. This is an older form of this word than dáń 'food' which is also used. See Sapir's article referred to in note 4.3, §1. 3. nee'i n dáhásht'íͅn 'I wanted sustenance from you'. nee- 'by means of you'; 'i n dá 'life, there is life'; hásht'íͅ , 1st person of há -...- t'íͅ 'to want, desire' [imp. neut. intr.]; -n past tense encl. 4. doo'íłtséshíͅłhédaí bíká nee'nyáͅda 'when one has started to eat you, you are not to kill him first'. doo-...-da negative; 'íłtsé 'first'; shíͅłhé , 2nd person imp. of si-...[si- perf.]- ł - ghé 'to kill' [act. tr.]; - í relative. bíká 'because of it'. nee'nyáͅ , 3rd person perf. of 0ee-'i-ni- |...[ni- perf.]- yáͅ 'to begin to eat'; -da 'even, just'.

(4.7) Linguistic Notes The second line of this passage is 1iterally as follows: "There / to after him / they looked, it is said:" (4.9) Linguistic Notes Gólijenłchiné 'beetle'. See Linguistic Note to Chiricahua text 15.1, §1. (4.11) Linguistic Notes dooshaa'isdánádáda 'you will not get away from me again'. The negative of the 2nd person imp. of 0aa- 'isdá - ná -...[hi- perf.]- dá 'one person gets away from, escapes from' [act. intr.]. See Linguistic Note to Chiricahua text 15.8, §2. [A literal translation of the Apache construction would read: "'Wait!' he [Beetle] said to him. Also [Coyote]: 'Wait!' he had said, 'You will not get away from me again!'--MEC] (4.12) Linguistic Notes goch'iͅiͅdahdiiłghoná'a 'he pounced on him'. goch'iͅiͅ 'toward him' plus the 3rd person perf. of dah-di-|...[ni- perf.]-l-ghee 'one person jumps, one person moves upward' [act. intr.]. dah-di-| 'upward'; - l-ghee 'one person moves'. (4.13) Linguistic Notes 1. tółáníńlíͅná'a 'a big river'. tó 'water'; łání , relative in - í of łáͅ 'much'; ńlíͅ 'it flows' [ni- perf. neut. intr.]. 2. tábaͅaͅyá 'on the bank'. tá -, combining form of tó 'water'; - baͅaͅ 'edge'.

(4.17) Linguistic Notes dáho'ołí 'that which is floating'. dá - 'just' plus the relative in - í of the 3rd person prog. of - eeł 'to float' [act. intr.]. (4.19) Linguistic Notes haná'ítin 'there is a road across'. Cf. bich'iͅiͅ'i'ítin 'there is a road to it' [passage 18]; 'íńtinyá 'on the road' [passage 9]; da'tinyá '[out of] the door, entrance way' [passage 6]. All of these seem to be composed of the theme - 'ítin or 'íńtin plus prefixes which vary the basic meaning 'road, passage'. Thus: haná - 'across'; bich'iͅiͅ 'toward it'; 'i- 'away'; dá - ? [in da'tin 'doorway']. (4.22) Linguistic Notes 1. yaanáhiitłeená'a 'he jumped'. 3rd person imp. of yaa- ná -hi-|...[ni- perf.]- tłee 'to jump [as a frog]' [act. intr.]. - tłee 'to flop; to fall heavily, of one's own weight'. yaa- ná -hi-|; cf. yaa- ná -ch'i-| with the theme - t'é which means 'to jump' [see note 1.1, §4]. 2. I do not understand the meaning or function of the form hííyéhéná'a in line 5 of this passage. The literal meaning of the rest of the line is as follows: "Then / to in the water / a little / he being seen / he was swimming:" (4.23) Linguistic Notes Note that the four verbs in this passage referring to the actions of Frog and Turtle--viz., ná'gałkóͅóͅłná'a 'they were swimming back'; goch'iini'góńłkóͅná'a [ch'ii- here is probably a misprint. In the Apache text this word appears as goch'iͅiͅni'góńłkóͅná'a --MEC] 'they swam toward him'; hagóͅóͅ'áájná'a 'they came out'; and goch'iͅiͅngóń'áájná'a 'they stood before him'--all employ the deictic prefix go- as a 3rd person dual subject pronoun. This usage is very frequent in the Mesc. texts whereas it occurs but seldom in the Chir. texts. (4.25) Linguistic Notes The informant translated dah'ádzaaná'a 'he sat up'. It seems, however, to be a combination of the prefix dah- 'up' and the 3rd person perf. of 'á -...[? perf.]- n dá [perf. stem -dzaa] 'to do so' [act. intr.]. (4.26) Linguistic Notes shiłnóot'as [This is most likely a misprint in the original, and should appear as shiłnóot'ash --MEC] 'he brought me back'. shił - 'with me' plus the 3rd person prog. of the theme -'aash 'two persons move' [act. intr.] with the prefix ná - 'back' [requires the -d- class]. (4.27) Linguistic Notes há n dí is apparently a combination of the interrog. pronoun há - and n dí , the 2nd person independent pronoun. (4.29) Linguistic Notes náshdiigijná'a 'he arose'. 3a person perf.of ná -di-|...[ni- perf.]-d- géésh 'to arise, to jump up' [act. intr.]. ná -di-| 'upward'; -d- géésh 'to move'. (4.32) Linguistic Notes yááł n díhí 'that you want'. I cannot analyze this form. (4.34) Linguistic Notes Literally, the second line of this passage is as follows: "The Turtle people / those of all kinds / at no time / anything / they have done so to it in vain." 'igáał'áshéne is composed of 'igáał'á 'kinds, varieties, species' [no analysis]; - shé 'side, party'; -ne 'people of such and such a group'. (4.35) Linguistic Notes 1. tó'iłch'áͅ'ádzaayá 'édaach'iisdiͅiͅ 'he disappeared in a splash of water'. tó 'water'; 'iłch'áͅ 'from one another'; 'ádzaa 'they have been made so'; - yá postposition [cf. note 3.48, §1]. édaach'iisdiͅiͅ is either the 3a distrib. perf. of é -...[si- perf.]- diͅiͅ 'to disappear' [act. intr.]; or the 3a person perf. with 3rd person distrib. obj. of 'é -...[si- perf.]- ł - diͅiͅ 'to cause to disappear' [act. tr.]. If the first of these alternatives is correct, why should the distrib. 3a person be employed to designate Turtle; if the second, why should the subject [i. e., tó'iłch'áͅ'ádzaayá have the postposition - yá ? 2. biłha'nách'inóͅóͅzi 'he came up again with it'. bił - 'with it' plus the 3a person perf. of ha-'i- ná -ni-...[hi- perf.]- zí 'to come out of the water again' [act. intr.]. ha- 'out'; ná - 'again' [why does this prefix not require a -d- class theme?]; 'i-ni- ? [cf. note 3.48, §2]. (4.39) Linguistic Notes The third line of this passage is literally as follows: "And / deer / its ribs / having been roasted / prairie dogs also / four / they lying on them / all / having been roasted / he brought them back out [of the water] to him." (4.41) Linguistic Notes bilahde 'its remains, remnants; what is left over'. (4.45) Linguistic Notes yáhánaaheestáͅná'a 'they were sitting about inside'. yáhá 'inside' plus the 3rd person of naa-hi-...- táͅ 'several sit about' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. Is yáhá related to the prefix ya- of the verb ya-'i-|...[hi- perf.]-ghee 'to carry a burden inside' [act. tr.], the 3rd person perf. [with indef. obj.] of which occurs in the next line of this passage? (4.46) Linguistic Notes nzhóͅ 'ágóńsiͅ 'keep the place clean'. nzhóͅ 'it is good, well' plus the 2nd person with place object of 'á -ni-...- ł - ziͅ 'to keep so' [imp. neut. tr.]. See also dáítsénzhóͅgo yiba'ágogóͅsiͅná'a 'both of them kept it very clean for him'. dáítsé - 'very' [procl.?]; yiba'- 'for him'; 'ágogóͅsiͅ , the 3rd person dual with place object of the above mentioned verb. (4.47) Linguistic Notes 1. ch'édátinyá 'out of doors'; ch'é - 'out' [see note 4.19]. 2. gólijenłchiní 'beetles' [see note 4.9]. hanshcha'ye 'grasshoppers' [no analysis but cf. the theme - chá 'to hop', cont. imp. and perf. stems -cha]. hansht'á'ye 'butterflies' [no analysis but cf. the above and the theme - t'á 'to fly']. dahiigohe 'moths' [no analysis]. (4.49) Linguistic Notes dábitsé'égoosteel 'he spread out [a robe] for them'. dá - 'just'; bitsé - 'for them' [?]; 'égoosteel , see note 2.25, §2. (4.55) Linguistic Notes 'áí zis 'iyáa bench'íńłtání 'that bag which Coyote had filled with things'. 'áí 'that'; zis 'bag'; 'iyáa 'something'; bench'íńłtání , relative in - í of bee- 'with it' plus the 3a person perf. of ni-ni-...[ni- perf.]- ł - tiͅiͅ 'to put down a sack-like object or a bundle' [act. tr.]. (4.57) Linguistic Notes dásíbidáneí 'their favorite food'. dásí 'exceedingly, very much'; bidáne 'their food'. Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 To throw food about or to handle it carelessly is thought very dangerous and unlucky. Even bones are not thrown around but are placed in a neat pile and disposed of at once. To do otherwise is to invite the loss of hunting skill and shortage of food. Ethnological Note 2 This refers to a previous episode wherein Beetle made believe he was receiving a message concerning Coyote from people beneath the earth and thus out-witted and escaped from Coyote. See Chiricahua Apache Text 15: "Coyote and Beetle". Ethnological Note 3 Frog is not referring to an actual road over to the island. As Coyote's answer shows, he is suggesting that Coyote swim across. Ethnological Note 4 This is one of the rare instances where Coyote comes off with honor in a food exchange story.</field>
