(20.1) 'Iͅiͅee, 'iłdóͅ, dá'ákodeeyágo n dé łáͅná'a. 'Áí 'aaee jíláͅee, 'iłdóͅ, dájiłe'é gózhóͅgo Gáͅhé bégojísiͅná'a. Dá'át'éshiͅ 'áí 'á n deedego Gáͅhé bégojísiͅgo kaagosh n díí dahń dá'áí 'ájit'íͅ, dahń 'áíná dooyáa'ághá n dída. Here, also, were a great many Indians. Here where they were many, also, only one knew in a good way about the Mountain Spirits. It is possible [that] these are the same ones of whom I spoke a while ago [who] knew about the Mountain Spirits, 1 [but] perhaps no one has spoken of them. Anyhow, this man who knew about the Mountain Spirits spoke to everyone. (20.2) Dá'aghát'éndah, 'ádíń n déń Gáͅhé yégósiͅń dájík'eh goch'iͅiͅyáłtiná'a: "Shit'ékéne, díͅíͅ'tł'éé' Gáͅhé nahá'ágoshlá. Dágotál si'áͅgo díͅíͅ' hiłkaa," daagooł n díná'a. Anyhow, this man who knew about the Mountain Spirits spoke to everyone. "My relatives, I will make Mountain Spirits for you four nights. The ceremony will last four days." he said to them. Then he had made it known to all the people. (20.3) 'Ákoo n dé díík'eh bich'agojiishchíͅná'a. n Déí díík'eh yaabiłgózhóͅná'a. Then he had made it known to all the people. All the people were happy about it. Then, when the sun had begun to go down, the Mountain Spirits were being decorated. (20.4) 'Ákoo, yaazhiͅ dees'áͅgo, Gáͅhé k'edaa'ichíná'a. 'I'óó'áͅná'a. Gołnééjíͅná'a. Gotálnt'aaee, Gáͅhé daa'deezhiizhee, koͅoͅłáͅgo dadaajiiskáͅná'a. n Déí 'isdzáͅyóí dájik'eh 'aaee daajiiskaná'a. Gáͅhéí koͅoͅzhoͅoͅkaná'a. Koͅoͅí daisíͅgo, hinájazhoshná'a. Báha'dat'áͅná'a. Gáͅhé daa'izhishná'a. Dá'ákodeeyágo goneedlíͅná'a. Then, when the sun had begun to go down, the Mountain Spirits were being decorated. The sun had set. Twilight had come. Where the ceremony was to be held, where the Mountain Spirits were to dance, they had built a big fire. All of the men [and] women had come there. The Mountain Spirits were coming to the fire. Blessping the fire, they were moving around it. Singing had begun for them. The Mountain Spirits danced. It was a great celebration. When the celebration was at its height, two Mountain Spirits that no one had ever seen before [came] from somewhere. (20.5) Dásí'ídiͅiͅ goneedlíͅnágo, ha'áshíͅhee Gáͅhé naaki doohádáͅot'íͅdaí. Dáchééyá gózhóͅgo k'ee'iischíͅí, bideeí díík'eh nzhóͅ k'e'iischíͅí, Gáͅhéí dákídaago n díií dá'áyáńzhóͅ daa'izhish, ndah, 'áí naaki doobédaagojísiͅdago 'aaee 'iłíłdéélí 'áíná 'itisgo gózhóͅ 'izhishná'a. Dá'áíná daajinéł'íͅná'a. Dá'áíná Gáͅhé łáͅgo 'át'éná'a. When the celebration was at its height, two Mountain Spirits that no one had ever seen before [came] from somewhere. They had been beautifully decorated. All of their horns had been well designed. 2 The Mountain Spirits that belonged to [the people] danced very well, but those two who had come there unknown to anyone danced much better. They looked at them alone. Only those Mountain Spirits were outstanding. Then the wise men spoke thus: (20.6) Nágo n dédaagóyáͅí 'ádaa n díná'a. Bédaa'iłch'iͅiͅhídiłkiná'a. "'Áí háń bi n díií 'át'íͅ?" daa'iłch'iͅiͅdih n díná'a. Dooháńyégósiͅdaná'a. Then the wise men spoke thus: They asked one another about them: "Who is it that owns these?" they said to one another. 3 No one knew about them. All of the Mountain Spirits danced until dawn. (20.7) Gáͅhéí díík'eh dádaa'izhishgo hiyałkááłná'a. Hayałkááłgo, 'it'a chaanágołgheełgo, ha'áhee 'iłyałdiłná'a. Doobédaagojísiͅdaná'a. Ch'édabédaagojiisiͅiͅná'a. All of the Mountain Spirits danced until dawn. As dawn was breaking, while it was still dark, the two [strangers] were going away somewhere. No one knew [where]. They had tried in vain to find out. At night, when the Mountain Spirits danced [and] were going back out of sight, those two also moved back there but they stopped far from the other Mountain Spirits. (20.8) Tł'éé'ee, Gáͅhéí daa'izhishee haná'an 'inájiyazhoshee, bí 'iłdóͅ 'ákaa 'iná'iłyałdił ndah 'áí gáͅhéłi'í bich'áͅ'aa n dashíͅ ni'iłyałdiłná'a. 'Áí Gáͅhéłi'í doobédaagósiͅdaná'a. At night, when the Mountain Spirits danced [and] were going back out of sight, those two also moved back there but they stopped far from the other Mountain Spirits. Those other Mountain Spirits knew nothing about them. The two [strangers] kept coming there every night. (20.9) Dá'iłtsołtł'éé'da 'aaee ná'iłiłdiłná'a. Dá'ághát'íͅgo díͅíͅ'tł'éé'ná'a. Dá'ághat'éndah, doobédaagojísiͅdaná'a. 'It'a chaanágołgheełgo, ha'áhee 'ihałghołná'a. The two [strangers] kept coming there every night. It happened so four nights. In spite of that, no one knew about them. While it was still dark, they always went away somewhere. Then all of the wise men spoke thus: (20.10) Nágo n dédaagóyáͅí díík'eh 'ádaa n díná'a: "Bégooziͅiͅgo nánzhóͅ." daaji n díná'a. "'Íͅíͅyaͅaͅda, díí tł'éé'eeí, 'aaee Gáͅhéí dádaa'izhishgo, dá'di'aa. 'Ákoo, ha'yágo 'iłiłdeełí bégooziͅiͅ." daaji n díná'a. Then all of the wise men spoke thus: "It is better that something be learned about them," they said. "Therefore, this very night, when the Mountain Spirits dance here, is the time [to find out]. Then, it will be learned where [it is] that they go." they said. Then they spoke thus again: (20.11) Nágo 'ánáádaashdih n díná'a: "Díí tł'éé'í, hayoołkáͅgo, nahlíͅíͅ' dásí'itisgo, daadijáí k'edaada'ah n dííł." daa'iłch'iͅiͅdih n díná'a. "Hayałkááłgo, koyágo 'iná'iłiłdiłí 'ákaa łíní nał'iłkéńzíͅgo 'áłá," daa'iłch'iͅiͅdih n díná'a. Then they spoke thus again: "Tonight, when dawn has come, saddle those of your horses which run the fastest." they said to one another, "As day is dawning, station yourselves on horseback at intervals along the way that those two customarily go away." they said to one another. Then, the night of the fourth night, the Mountain Spirits danced the high step until the sun had risen. (20.12) Nágo díͅíͅ'tł'éé'í bitł'éé', Gáͅhéní dádaa'izhisgo nódáhaa da'n'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo 'it'a 'aaee naaná'iłałdiłná'a. Then, the night of the fourth night, the Mountain Spirits danced the high step until the sun had risen. 4 And the two [strangers] were still moving about there. Then they began to do what [the wise men] had told them. (20.13) 'Ákoo 'ádaagołji n dínyá 'ádaajiláná'a. Łíͅdásídaadijáíná, dziłí bich'iͅiͅgo 'áí Gáͅhéí 'iná'iłiłdiłní 'ákoyá goł'iłkéńzíͅgo 'ádaajiláná'a. Łíͅdásí'itisgo dijáí dásí'ík'e'áńyá; dziłí bich;iͅiͅ'áháánéyá gołńyáná'a. Then they began to do what [the wise men] had told them. [Riding] only the fastest horses, they placed themselves at intervals along the way that those two Mountain Spirits had been going away toward the mountain. The horse that ran best was farthest away: he went with [his rider] close to the mountain. 5 When they had said (20.14) "K'adi." daashdees n diigo, Gáͅhé daa'izhishní 'ánágoosdiͅiͅná'a. Dágoghe'shíͅ, ghahá ch'é'iłíłdéélná'a. Łíͅ'iłkéńzíͅní biyeeshxahyá 'iłałdiłná'a. Bich'iͅiͅłíͅdaajíńtálná'a. Łíͅ yeesháń iłałdiłí dá'ákogo 'iłałdił náánóółt'eená'a. Dziłích'iͅiͅgo kaadaahíłgheená'a. Dásí'íke'áńyá łíͅ'itisgo dijáí gołsizíͅní dá'áída t'ó'édiͅ yee'inádáná'a. When they had said "Ready," the Mountain Spirits who had been dancing stopped. From their midst, the two [strangers] ran out yonder. They were going close to the line of horses. [The riders] spurred their horses after them. The two who ran before the horses kept on going just so. 6 They ran toward the mountain. Even that one who had been standing farthest away with the fastest horse returned with nothing 7 Then, right up close where everybody saw it, lay a big mountain. (20.15) Ákoo, dá'áshíͅ 'áháánéshíͅ dájík'eh daaja'íͅshíͅ, dziłntsaaí si'áͅná'a. Nódágo tsénáńt'iná'a. 'Áí bich'iͅiͅyá, dádaajinéł'íͅgo, handa'iłałdiłná'a.

Then, right up close where everybody saw it, lay a big mountain. It was a high rock wall. Toward that, as they watched them, the two [strangers] were moving up. They kept turning back toward them [and] making a noise. 8 As they watched them, the two stopped directly at the center of the big rock wall. There they stood making a noise. The rock spread apart. The two went in there. Then all of the people went back to where the ceremony had been held. (20.16) Nágo n déní díík'eh gotál si'áͅnee 'inájíkáná'a. Doogołdanzhóͅdayá 'ádaajídzaaí 'iłch'iͅiͅbańdaajit'íͅná'a. Then all of the people went back to where the ceremony had been held. They did not like what they had done [and] discussed it among themselves. 9 "We have done something that it is not good to do." (20.17) "Dooha'yágo 'ágháhih n dá nzhóͅdayá 'ádaahidzaa." daaji n dígo doogołdanzhóͅdago bańdaajit'íͅná'a. "Gółdzilgo 'itéńdliigo: Doonaahiidziidago, ha'yágoda gózhóͅgo nahch'iͅiͅgo n dáná'a hálí. Doo'ágháhiidzaada, ha'yágoda nahch'iͅiͅnzhóͅgólaagoda 'át'íͅná'a hálí. Dánahí, n déndlíͅí, doo'ákaadayá 'áhiidzaa." daaji n dígo doogołdanzhóͅdago 'iłch'iͅiͅbańdaajit'íͅná'a. "We have done something that it is not good to do." they said as they discussed that which they did not like. "Pray with all your power: If we had not bothered them, something good might have happened to us. If we had not done so, even something which was good to us might have been. We, who are only men, did wrong." they said as they discussed that which they did not like among themselves. There were many of them at that time. (20.18) Dá'ájíláͅná'a 'ádáͅ. Dá'ághát'éndah 'iyádíhee kaaí gotańyáná'a. 'Áshíͅ, doo'aa n dagodeeyádago, 'áí jiͅláͅgo 'égoosdiͅiͅná'a. 'Ákoo doodá'áyájíláͅdaná'a. There were many of them at that time. But some kind of a disease came among them. Then, not long afterward, many of them died. Then there were not very many of them. At that time, long ago, they respected those Mountain Spirits. (20.19) 'Ádáͅ, 'iłk'idáͅ, díídíí Gáͅhéí nébił'ílíͅná'a. n Déí 'insíͅná'a. Dziłdaadiighiͅí bighe'shíͅ gólíͅ, n n dé da n dí. Dziłdaadighiͅí bighe'shíͅ 'áí n dé Gáͅhé yédaagósiͅí bich'iͅiͅyádaałti.

At that time, long ago, they respected those Mountain Spirits. The people blessed them. They lived in the sacred mountains, the people said. From inside the sacred mountains, they talked to those people who knew about the Mountain Spirits. But we, because they do not talk to us, will therefore not believe [this]. They do not speak so, you will say. But then, too, they cannot speak to all of us. Not all of us can know about the Mountain Spirits. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (20.1) Linguistic Notes 1. dájiłe'é 'only one'. Cf. note 19.1, §4. 2. A literal translation of the last line of this passage is as follows: "it is possible / those / a while ago / Mountain Spirits / they knowing about them / they about whom I told / perhaps / those same ones / they are so / perhaps / those only / no one has said so." dá'át'éshiͅ 'it is possible'; dá - 'just'; 'át'é 'it is so'; - shiͅ dubitative enclitic. (20.4) Linguistic Notes 1. yaazhiͅ dees'áͅgo 'when the sun had begun to go down'. yaa- 'down'; - zhiͅ 'to'. dees'áͅ , 3rd person perf. of di-...[si- perf.]-aa 'a round object begins to move' [act. intr.]. 2. daa'deezhiizhee 'where they were to dance'. 3rd person distrib. perf. of 'i-di- ...[si- perf.]- zhíísh 'to begin to dance' [act. intr.; 'i- ?]. 3. 'isdzáͅyóí 'the women'. 'isdzáͅ -, bound form of 'isdzáͅń 'woman'; - yó a plural suffix restricted to words denoting persons. 4. hinájazhoshná'a 'they were moving around it'. 3rd person prop. of 0- ná -ji-...[si- perf.]- zhóósh 'several move as a group around' [act. intr.; ná - 'around']. (20.5) Linguistic Notes 1. dásí'ídiͅiͅ goneedlíͅnágo 'when the celebration was at its height'. dásí - 'very'; 'ídiͅiͅ 'exceedingly'; goneedlíͅ 'there is a celebration' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 17.6, §4]; - ná 'just'. 2. dáchééyá 'very, exceedingly' [part.]. This sentence and the next could be considered independent clauses of the sentence following since both principal verbs are followed by the relative enclitic -i. ["independent" is likely to be a misprint--Hoijer probably meant "dependent" clauses in this note. See Grammatical Sketch, §5, Noun Compounds, part c. Noun plus verb plus relative enclitic--MEC] 3. dákídaago n díií 'those that belonged to them'. dákí 'just them'. daa-go- 3a distrib. pronoun; - n díi belonging to'. Literally: 'those that belonged to them, them alone'. 4. 'iłíłdéélí 'those two who had come'. 3rd person perf.of. 'ił -ni-...[ni- perf.]- ł - deeł two come' [act. intr.]. The function of 'ił - is not clear; ni- completive. Perhaps the literal meaning is 'to cause one another to move completively'; i. e., 'two move completively [in company with] one another'. 5. łáͅgo át'éná'a 'they were outstanding'. Literally: 'being much, they are so'. (20.7) Linguistic Notes 1. chaanágołgheełgo 'it being yet dark'. Imp. with place subj. of chaa- ná -...[? perf.]-l- gheeł 'to become dark again, to be still dark' [act. intr.]. chaa- 'darkness, shade'; ná - 'again' [requires the -l- class]. The -l- class is indicated in the text form by the fact that the initial stem consonant does not assimilate in voice to the - ł - [historically -l-] preceding it. 2. 'iłyałdiłná'a 'they were going'. 3rd person prog. with prefix 'ił - of the theme -l- deeł 'two move' [act. intr.]. Only in the prog. can this theme be used with only the prefix 'ił -. Cf. note 20.6, §4. I do not know why 'ił - plus the prog. prefix becomes 'iłyał - rather than 'iłał -. (20.8) Linguistic Notes 1. 'iná'iłyałdił 'they went back'. The prog. form i[ya[di[ [see note 20.7, §2] with the prefixes 'i- 'away' and ná - 'back'. 2. ni'iłyałdiłná'a 'they stopped'. The prog. form with the prefix ni- 'to a stop'. (20.9) Linguistic Notes 1. dá'iłtsołtł'éé'da 'every night'. dá -...-da 'just, absolutely'; 'iłtso 'all, every'; - ł - ?; tł'éé' 'night'. 2. ná'iłiłdiłná'a 'they kept coming'. 3rd person iter. of 'ił -ni-...[ni- perf.]- ł - deeł 'two come' [act. intr.]. See note 20.5, §4. (20.10) Linguistic Notes 1. nánzhóͅ 'it is better'. 3rd person of ná -ni-...- zhóͅ 'to be better' [imp. neut. intr.]. Cf. ni-...- zhóͅ 'to be good'. 2. dá'di'aa 'it is the time'. da- 'just' plus the imp. of 'i-di-...[si- perf.]-aa, 'a round object begins to move' [act. intr.; 'i- indef. pronoun; di- inceptive]. Literally: 'a round object [i. e., the sun] is just about to move'. (20.11) Linguistic Notes 1. dásí'itisgo daadijáí 'those which run the fastest'. dásí - 'very'; 'itis 'over, above'. daadijá , 3rd person distrib. of di-...- já 'to run fast, to be a fast runner' [imp. neut. intr.]. 2. k'edaada'ah n dííł 'saddle them'. Literally 'put several objects on top of them'. k'e- 'on'; da- [also dah-] 'on top, on'; daa'i- distrib. indef. pronoun; ah- 2nd person dual imp.; - n dííł 'to handle several objects' [act. tr.]. 3. Literally, the last line of this passage means: "dawn coming over yonder / that [way] in which they usually go away / there / horses / they standing with you in a line after one another / you do so / they said to one another." 'iná'iłiłdił 'they usually go away' is the 3rd person iter. of 'ioͅił -...[hi- perf.]- ł - deeł 'two go away' [act. intr.; 'i- 'away']. See note 20.5, §4. nał'iłkéńzíͅ 'they stand with you in a line after one another'. 'They' refers to the horses; 'You' to the riders. nał - 'with you'; 'iłké 'after, or next to, one another'. ńzíͅ 'they stand in a line' [3rd person ni- perf. neut. intr.]. (20.12) Linguistic Notes 1. nódáhaa 'the high step' [see ethnological notes 4 to the English translation of this story, listed as note 20.4]. Cf. nódá 'high' [part.]. 2. da'n'áͅná'a 'the sun had risen'. Perf. of da-i-di-|...[ni- perf.]-aa 'a round object arises, goes up' [act. intr.]. da-di-| [also dah-di-|] 'upward'; 'i- indef. pronoun. (20.13) Linguistic Notes dásí'ík'e'áńyá 'he was farthest away'. dásí -'very'; 'ík'e'áńyá is possibly 'ík'e'á 'to the last, farthest' plus ńyá , 3rd person perf. of ni-...[ni- perf.]- yá 'one goes' [act. intr.].

Ethnological Note 2 The "horns" refer to uprights of yucca stalk wood which rise above the buckskin masks. Ethnological Note 3 It is not difficult to tell to whom a certain set of dancers "belong," that is, by whom they were dressed and designed, for the symbols, colors, and patterns used by each man who knows a masked dancer ceremony, are distinctive. Ethnological Note 4 The masked dancers perform three dance steps or types of dancing and for each kind a different set of songs is sung. One of these types is the "high" step mentioned in the text, which, because it requires that the legs be raised very high, is considered to be the most strenuous and tiring of the three. Ethnological Note 5 This "relay" method of pursuit is utilized in hunting. A deer is started in the direction in which a number of men, each quite a distance from the next, wait on horseback. Each pursues the quarry in turn and forces the animal to extend itself to the utmost. Then the last rider, on his fresh horse, can easily overtake and kill the exhausted animal. Ethnological Note 6 That is, they kept ahead of the horsemen who were not able to catch them. Ethnological Note 7 That is, he returned without having caught the strange Mountain Spirits. Ethnological Note 8 The reference is to a peculiar warbling cry made by the Mountain Spirits. Ethnological Note 9 That is, they were frightened to learn that they had been pursuing the true Mountain Spirits.</field>
