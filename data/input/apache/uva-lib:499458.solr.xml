Now, also, there was no day. That--these birds of the kind that fly [and] all the small [creatures] did not like [it that, it was always dark]. (7.2) 'Áí -- díídíí 'izháshee'át'éí naadaa'i n diishégo daabizáͅáͅyéí díík'eh dáchaagołheełnáánóółt'eeí doobiłdanzhóͅdaná'a. 'Ákoo łashégoí dábeenégodzi'íná bijádedaadíͅíͅ'íná 'át'íͅná'a. Áí díík'eh díídíídáchaagołheełgoná biłnzhóͅná'a. That--these birds of the kind that fly [and] all the small [creatures] did not like [it that, it was always dark]. And those on the other side were only the predatory [creatures] that had four legs. All of these liked it that there was only darkness. Then: (7.3) 'Ákoo: "Bíká 'iłaajíkágo baayá'iti." daaji n díná'a. Then: "There is to be a gathering to discuss it." they said. They talked about it. (7.4) Baayádaajóółti. Nágo: "'Áhaͅh, hikáí baadaa'deekaa." daaji n díná'a. They talked about it. Then: "Very well, let's gamble for day." they said. Then they began to play the moccasin game. (7.5) 'Ákoo kéhee daa'shdeeskaaná'a. 'Ákoo 'áńdeeda daa'shdeeskaaná'a. 'Ákoo k'adi 'ánágat'iͅiͅł 'iłch'áͅnáágonah n dééł. Then they began to play the moccasin game. 1 And then they began to gamble. And now it was happening [that] each side won and lost alternately. Now then, that Wren wanted the day. (7.6) K'adi 'ákoo, 'áń Tséńłghéésee 'áń hiłkaa hát'íͅná'a. 'Ákoo łashégo n dédantsaaí 'áí doohádaat'íͅdaná'a hiłkaaí. 'Ákoo n débizháͅáͅyéí 'áí hiłkaa hádaat'íͅná'a. Now then, that Wren wanted the day. And the big fellows on the other side did not want the day. And the little fellows did want the day. Then the others, speaking thus again, (7.7) Ákoo łií 'ánáádaa n díí, "Doohiłkaagólíͅda !" daa n díná'a. Then the others, speaking thus again, "There is no day!" they said. And the others: (7.8) 'Ákoo łií: "Hiiskáͅ hayóółkáͅ !" daa n íná'a. And the others: "Morning has dawned!" they said. And now the former: (7.9) 'Ákoo k'adí náánáłií: "Doohiłkaagólíͅda !" daa n díná'a. And now the former: "There is no day!" they said. Someone who was very big (7.10) 'Iyáahee ntsaaí 'áá'ee naa'itaná'a. "Hayóółkáͅ. Shí, k'adi, doohaͅhnaashádaí, nahba'hoshááł" n díná'a. 'Ákoo 'oóyáná'a. Someone who was very big 2 was there among them. "Day has dawned. I, now, who cannot move about rapidly, I'll go on before you." he said. And he went away. Then, there at the borders of his back, there the day had come. (7.11) 'Ákoo, dzaͅaͅee bitł'aabaͅaͅyá, dzaͅaͅee hiiskáͅná'a. 'Ákoo 'iłeedaa'jiniigáͅná'a. Then, there at the borders of his back, there the day had come. 3 And they began to fight with one another. Then, now, that person who was big was [still] there among them. (7.12) 'Ákoo, k'adi, 'áń n démtsaań 'áá'ee 'itasitíͅná'a 'Áń dá'áná, daajiiłhégo baatiͅiͅjakaná'a. 'Áń n déntsaań bikétł'áyégoda bijéí si'áͅná'a Doobédaagojísiͅdaná'a. Then, now, that person who was big was [still] there among them. That one, only that one, they attacked in order to kill him. The heart of that person who was big lay under his foot. They did not know it. Then Gray Lizard spoke thus to them: (7.13) Ákoo Ma'ishóͅíłbáyé 'ádaagooł n díná'a: "'Aań bikétł'áhyá bijéí si'áͅ. Nahánsht'ó. K'aa shaanah'iͅiͅ." daagooł n díná'a. Then Gray Lizard spoke thus to them: "That one's heart lies under his foot. I'll shoot him for you. Give me arrows." he said to them. Then the Gray Lizard went in under his foot. (7.14) 'Ákoo Ma'ishóͅíłbáyéń gokétł'áyá 'oołghoná'a. Gokétł'áyá yíńłt'oná'a. Goyeesxíͅná'a. K'adi 'áń daajiyeesxíͅná'a. Then the Gray Lizard went in under his foot. He shot him under his foot. He killed him. Now they had killed that one. And now [for] the Snake also. (7.15) Nágo k'adi Góídaná'a. Góí tségizhiyá bi n dáaí káyóółdéél dooha'yágobich'iͅiͅgózhóͅdayá. 'Ákoo kaa'isdadaayáná'a. 'Áíbee gó gooslíͅná'a. Dooła daajílaadaná'a. And now [for] the Snake also. The Snake threw his eyes in a crevice of the rock where it was impossible to get them. Then he got away from them. For that reason there are snakes [now]. None of them got him. Now they attacked the Bear also. (7.16) K'adi Shashí 'iłdóͅ baatiͅiͅnáájakaná'a. Daajiiłhégo, ditsiͅ łáͅí sikaaí bich'iͅiͅkaadaahí n dáná'a. Ditsiͅsikaaí kaaghédaayáná'a. Kaa'isdadaayáná'a. Doodaajiyeesxiͅdaná'a. Now they attacked the Bear also. As they were killing him, he dragged them toward a large grove of trees. He walked into the grove of trees. He got away from them. They did not kill him. And that large grove of trees into which he went is called "A Grove of Trees Lies." (7.17) 'Ákoo 'áí tsiͅłání sikaaí kaaghéhóóyáí 'áá'ee "Tsiͅskaa" googhé. Dííjíͅ 'áá'ee shash łáͅ. And that large grove of trees into which he went is called "A Grove of Trees Lies." Today [there are] many bears there. This place where they played the moccasin game is today just like it was then. (7.18) 'Ádíídíí łíͅnádaałjóótseelí díjíͅ 'it'a 'á n deede ná'aí k'ehát'é.

'I n daaí n déídaa łáͅ hilaadeeda, dáhazhiͅ dá'á n deenáánóółt'eedaał." daaji n díná'a. This place where they played the moccasin game is today just like it was then. Why it is as it was then is for this reason: when they had finished fighting one another, then they returned together to that place where they had played the moccasin game. Then they spoke thus: "From now on, all of this [will] be just so. It will always be unchanged. No one will meddle with it. Though there come to be many White men and Indians, it will always remain unchanged." they said. That [place] today is still just so; these things that they say happened occurred.

Literally, the text form means: 'only those by means of whom there is danger'. 5. bijádedaadíͅíͅ'íná 'only those who had four legs'. bijáde 'their legs'; daa- distrib.; díͅíͅ' 'four'; - í relative; - ná 'only'. (7.3) Linguistic Notes 1. bíká 'for it'. - ká 'for, in order to' requires a high tone on its prefixes. 2. 'iłaajíkágo 'they, coming together'. 3a person imp. of 'ił -aa-ni-...[ni- perf.]- ká 'several come together, meet' [act. intr.]. 'ił - reciprocal; aa- 'to'; ni- completive. 3. baayá'iti 'there is to be discussion about it'. baa- 'about it'. yá'iti , 3rd person imp. with indef. subj. of yá -...[hi- perf.]-ti 'a discussion is held' [act. intr.; yá - thematic].

Cf. ké 'bone used in moccasin game'. 2. 'ánágat'iͅiͅł 'it was happening'. 3rd person prog. of 'á - ná -go-...[hi- perf.]-t'ii 'something happens, goes on' [act. intr.]. 'á - 'thus so'; ná - 'again' [?]; go- place subject [?]. 3. 'iłch'áͅnáágonah n dééł 'each side won and lost alternately'. 'iłch'áͅ 'from one another'. náágonah n dééł , 3rd person prog. of náá -go-ni-...[si- perf.]-d- n d é ' a game is won again and again' [act. intr.]. náá - 'again and again' requires the -d- class. go- place subj. referring to 'game' [?]. ni- terminative. (7.6) Linguistic Notes 1. Tséńłghéésee 'wren'. t sé 'rock, stone'. - ńłghéés - resembles the 2nd person imp. of di-...[si- perf.]-l-gh éés 'to dodge, twist, turn' [mediopas.; di- becomes n- in the second person]. - ee may be an archaic relative enclitic. Therefore, the form may mean literally: 'you who dodge about rocks'. 2. hiłkaa hát'íͅná'a 'he wanted day, it is said'. hiłkaa 'day is dawning' is here used as a noun [cf. notes 7.1 and 7.4, §1]. hát'íͅ , 3rd person of há -...- t'íͅ 'to want, to desire' [imp. neut. intr.]. See note 2.6, §1. 3. n dédantsaaí 'the big fellows'. n dé 'person'. dantsaa , 3rd person distrib. of ni-...-tsaa 'to be big' [imp. neut. intr.]. (7.8) Linguistic Notes hiiskáͅ hayóółkáͅ 'morning has dawned'. hiiskáͅ , 3rd person perf. of hi-...[si- perf.]- ł -kaa 'day dawns' [act. intr.] is here used as a noun. hayóółkáͅ , 3rd person perf. of ha-yi-...[hi- perf.]- ł -kaa 'day dawns, morning breaks' [act. intr.; ha- 'out' ?]. yi- in this form is probably cognate with the hi- of the preceding verb. (7.10) Linguistic Notes 1. naa'itaná'a 'he was among them, it is said'. 3rd person imp. with indef. obj. of naa-|...[si- perf.]-ta 'to be among' [act. tr.; naa-| 'about']. 2. doohaͅhnaashádaí 'I who cannot move about rapidly'. naasha 'I move about' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 1.6, §1]; haͅh 'rapidly, quickly'. 3. nahba'hoshááł 'I'll go on before you'. nah- 2nd person dual pronoun; -ba' 'before'; hoshááł , 3rd person prog. of - yá' 'one moves'. 4. 'oóyáná'a 'he went away, it is said'. 3rd person perf. of 'i-|...[hi- perf.]- yá 'one goes away' [act. intr.; 'i-| 'away']. (7.11) Linguistic Notes 1. bitł'aabaͅaͅyá 'at the borders of his back'. - tł'aa 'back, buttocks'; - baͅaͅ 'edge, border'. 2. 'iłeedaa'jiniigáͅná'a 'they began to fight with one another, it is said'. 3a person distrib. imp. of 'ił - ee-'i-ni-|...[ni- perf.]- gáͅ 'to begin to fight' [act. intr.]. 'ił - reciprocal pronoun; ee-'i-ni-| 'to begin to do ...' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 2.11, §1]. This theme, i. e., - gáͅ , is possibly a -d- form of - gháͅ 'to kill several'. The verb 'to fight' always requires the reciprocal prefix 'ił - and this prefix requires the -d- class. Therefore, the verb 'to fight' probably means literally; 'to kill one another'. (7.12) Linguistic Notes 1. 'itasitíͅná'a 'he was among them, it is said'. 'i- indef. pronoun; -ta 'among' [pp.; cf.. note 7.10, §1]. sitíͅ 'an animate being lies' [3rd person si- perf. neut. intr.]. 2. baatiͅiͅjakaná'a 'they attacked him, it is said'. 3a person perf. of 0aa- tiͅiͅ -...[hi- perf.]- ká 'several attack someone' [act. intr.]. aa- 'to'; - tiͅiͅ 'attack' [?]. The theme alone means 'several move' [act. intr.]. 3. bikétł'áyégoda 'under his foot'. - ké 'foot' [non-poss. form]; - tł'áyé , a compounded form of - tł'á 'under, beneath'; -go subord.; -da 'even'. (7.13) Linguistic Notes 1. bikétł'áhyá 'under his foot'. Note that here - tł'á 'under' has the form - tł'áh - Cf. note 7.12, §3. 2. nahánsht'ó 'I'll shoot him for you'. nahi- 2nd person dual pronoun; - á 'for'. nsht'ó , 1st person imp. of ni-...[ni- perf.]- ł - t'ó 'to shoot at' [act. tr.; ni- completive]. 3. shaanah'iͅiͅ 'give them to me'. 2nd person dual imp. of 0aa-ni...[ni- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ , 'to give someone an unknown object' [act. tr.; aa- 'to'; ni- completive]. Since the object of the verb is definitely known and stated [k'aa 'arrows'], this use of the theme - 'iͅiͅ is irregular [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 6.4, §3]. (7.15) Linguistic Notes 1. góídaná'a 'the snake also, it is said'. gó 'snake'; -da 'even, also'. 2. tségizhiyá 'in a rock crevice'. tsé 'rock'; - gizhi 'between, interstice, gap'. 3. káyóółdéél 'he had thrown them for them'. ká - 'for them'. 'iyóółdéél , 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of 'i-|...[hi- perf.]- ł - deeł 'to throw away several objects' [act. tr.; 'i-| 'away']. 4. dooha'yágobich'iͅiͅgózhóͅdayá 'where it was impossible to get them'. ha'yágo 'in some way'; bich'iͅiͅ 'toward them'; gózhóͅ 'place is good'.

See note 7.12, §2. 2. ditsiͅ łáͅí sikaaí 'a large grove of tress'. ditsiͅ 'trees'; łáͅ 'many'; sikaa 'a clump [of trees] lies' [3rd person si- perf. neut. intr.]. 3. bich'iͅiͅkaadaahí n dáná'a 'he dragged them toward it, it is said'. bich'iͅiͅ 'toward it'. 3rd person imp. of 0aa-daa-ni...[ni- perf.]- yá 'one drags several along' [act. intr.]. aa- 'from' ?; daa- ?; ni- completive. 4. kaaghédaayáná'a 'he went in from them, it is said'. 3rd person perf. of 0aa- ghé -daa-|...[si- perf.]- yá 'one goes in from someone' [act. intr.]. ghé - 'in' [cf. -ghe' 'in']; daa- ?.

See note 7.16, §4. 3. tsiͅskaa 'a grove of trees lies' [place name]. tsiͅ 'trees' plus sika 'a clump [of trees] lies'.

Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 ////The moccasin game is played at night and in the winter only. Should the game continue into the day the contestants must blacken their faces with charcoal. Sides are chosen [both men and women play and the sides are not limited as to number] and a fire is kindled. On its side of the fire each group buries four moccasins in a row, leaving only the open tops visible. The object of the game is for one side to hide a bone in one of the four moccasins so sucessfully that the other side cannot guess in which moccasin the bone lies. When one side is prepared to hide the bone, a blanket is held between the two opposing groups. While the hiding of the bone is in progress, the side in possession of the bone sings songs which the participants in the first game reputedly sang at that time. Thus there is a song concerning every being who took part in the game for night or day. Where the bone has been hidden and the moccasin tops have been filled with grass, the blanket is lowered and someone of the other side steps forward, stick in hand, to strike the moccasin which he thinks contains the bone. If he is correct in his guess, the bone passes to his side and it is his side which will do the hiding. Should he miss the right moccasin, however, his side has to give their opponents a number of yucca counters, the number depending upon the position of the moccasin chosen in respect to the one which really contained the bone. If the representative of one side misses the bone, it remains in the possesion of the opposition and they proceed to hide the bone again until a correct guess takes it away from them. The game ends when all of the counters are in the possession of one side. This was one of the most common of Chiricahua Apache gambling games. Not only was the betting high between the groups on the final outcome of the game, but there were also many individual wagers laid at each stroke of the stick. ////There are other ways of guessing where the bone lies besides striking the moccasin with a stick, and other tricks of hiding besides placing the bone in one of the moccasins. All these variations have their rules and count, but the details are too numerous and complex to discuss here. Ethnological Note 2 Giant of Chiricahua text 1.2 is probably meant, for he plays the part in other versions that have been collected. Note the reference to his slow-footedness. Ethnological Note 3 Many informants claim to have seen the place; to have seen the gap in the cliff through which light first streamed, to have seen the rock crevice, with the arrows of the birds still wedged in them, into which the snake escaped, etc. [in the 1938 edition, the second occurance of this note reference is given the number "4". However, there is no note 4 to correspond with it; and note 3 appears be the reference here as well--MEC].</field>
