(6.1) K'adi nii'íkáee `ił`ango bindáayeedaa'igháͅáͅ'í díík'eh naajiistseená'a. K'adi ndé `ágojiláná'a. Now he had killed all of those different ones on earth who killed with their eyes. Now he was to create human beings. He made two mud [figures] just like men. (6.2) Goshtł`ish ndé k'éhát'égo naaki `ájílaaná'a. `Isdzáń `iłdóͅ naaki k'eht'égo `ájílaaná'a. Haodzígo `ájílaaná'a dík'eh. He made two mud [figures] just like men. He also made two just like women. He made all of them capable of speech. 1 Then, [to one] man and woman: (6.3) Nágo, ndéshíͅ `isdzáńdó: "Nahí ndé hinahédaał." gołjindíná'a. "Nahí `iłdóͅ naadinałt'éí `indaa hinahédaał." gołjindíná'a. Then, [to one] man and woman: "You two will be called Indians." he said [to them]. "You others, you two will be called white men." he said to them. Then he set down [several things] for them. (6.4) `Ákoo káni'jíńłdéélná'a. Tóbájishchinéń ndéne yáná'dii'iͅiͅgo, Naaghéé'neesghánéń `indaa yáná'dii'iͅiͅgo; `iłtiͅiͅ k'aabił kánjíń'iͅiͅná'a. Then he set down [several things] for them. Child of the Water is to choose for the Indians [and] Killer of Enemies is to choose for the white men; 2 He put down a gun and a bow and arrow for them. Then Child of the Water [and] Killer of Enemies, quarrelled with each other. (6.5) Nágo Tóbájishchinéń Naaghéé'neesghánéń bił`iłaanaagot'aashná'a. " n Dí `iłtsé ná'n'iͅiͅ." iłjidihndíná'a. Then Child of the Water [and] Killer of Enemies, quarrelled with each other. "You choose first." they said to each other. A little later Child of the Water chose the bow and arrow for the Indians. (6.6) Dá'óós'ago Tóbájiishchinéń k'aaí ndé yánáinłjeená'a. "'Ádíídíínábégóziͅ `ájílágo." ndíná'a. A little later Child of the Water chose the bow and arrow for the Indians. "The making of these is understood." he said. Then Killer of Enemies picked up the gun that remained without saying anything. (6.7) `Ákoo Naaghéé'neesghánéń `iłtiͅiͅ bich'áͅná'shn'iͅiͅí dooyáłtidahe náintáͅná'a. Then Killer of Enemies picked up the gun that remained without saying anything. And then he put down two mountains for them. (6.8) `Ákoo k'adi dził naaki kánjíńłdeelná'a. Łi'íyá bikáee gońłch'ilná'a. nDé bidáńí --- dá'ákodeeyá nánt'íͅíͅ, biͅiͅí, dziłátaazheí --- díík'eh biká' gólíͅná'a. Ghashíͅgo dziłsi'áͅí dooyáabiká'gólíͅdaná'a. Dádiłkoͅoͅdego si'áͅíbaͅaͅ, Tobájishchinéń hich'áͅná'n'iͅiͅná'a. And then he put down two mountains for them. On one of them there was a heavy growth of vegetation. The Indians' food--wild growing things, deer, wild turkeys--all of these were on it. The other mountain that lay there had nothing on it. Because it lay absolutely barren, Child of the Water chose [the former mountain]. Then Killer of Enemies chose for the white man that mountain which [Child of theWater] had left. (6.9) Nágo Naaghéé'nesghánéń 'áí dziłí bich'áͅná'shn'iͅiͅní `indaa yánáin'iͅiͅná'a. Nágo 'áí dził dooyáabaagólíͅdaní `iłch'áͅ'ádzaaná'a. `Áí bighe'shíͅ, łíní, dzaandeezí dásídanzhóͅníná, náa'tsílií, dibéhéí, góochií, taazheí --- díík'eh ch'énádaaheesáͅná'a. Kát'égo `indaaí ndéíbił baa'shdóó'iͅiͅná'a. Then Killer of Enemies chose for the white man that mountain which [Child of theWater] had left. And that mountain which had nothing on it spread apart. From inside it, horses, the very best mules, cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens--all of these came out. In that way he gave [things] to White Men and the Indian. So the Indian live on those wild growing things. (6.10) `Áíbee ndéí `ádíídíí dá'ákodeeyá nádánt'íͅíͅ díík'eh yeehindáná'a. "Biͅiͅ'ádaat'éí, dziłátaazheí, dá'ákodeeyá daagólíͅ, yeehindádaał." jindíná'a. So the Indian live on those wild growing things. "All varieties of deer, turkeys, [and] the things that are wild will they live on." he said. 3 "The White Men, working, will live on cultivated plants." (6.11) "'Indaaí, naa'iziigo, ná'nłt'íͅí hich'áͅshíͅ hindádaał." jindíná'a. "The White Men, working, will live on cultivated plants." he said. Then he spoke thus to the white man: (6.12) `Ákoo `indaaí `áałjíndíná'a. "`Iłch'áͅ'aandahyá --- díídíí tógonásga'í hananyá --- `iłch'áͅgonałíͅdaał. Dáhaaee `iłiyaałtsééłee, naagonałdzoodaał --- ndéń `indaańbił." goołjindíná'a. Then he spoke thus to the white man: "Very far apart--on the other side of this ocean--you will live from one another. Whenever you see one another, you will fight--Indian with white man." he said to them. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (6.1) Linguistic Notes nii'íkáee should read n dii'íkáee 'on the surface of the earth'. n dii' - bound form of n dii 'earth'; - í relative; - ká 'surface, top'; - ee 'at, on'. (6.2) Linguistic Notes 1. goshtł'ish 'mud, clay'. 2. n dé k'éhát'égo 'being just like men'. ndé 'men'; k'éhát'égo 'it is just like, it is similar' is found only in the 3rd person. Cf. - 'á -ni-...- t'é 'to be so' [imp. neut. intr.; 'á - 'so'; ni- adj.]. 3. haodzígo 'they, having spoken'. 3rd person perf. of ha -|...[hi- perf.]-d-dzii 'to talk, speak'[act.intr.; ha-| ?]. This form is adverbial to that following, 'ájílaaná'a 'he made them so, it is said'. (6.3) Linguistic Notes 1. n déshíͅ 'isdzáńdó 'man and woman'. - shíͅ , ordinarily the pp. 'from', and - dó , ordinarily 'also', function here as a conjunction. 2. nahí n dé hinahédaał 'you two, you two will be called Indians'. The indep. pronoun nahí is used for emphasis [see Grammatical Sketch, §2]. Note that n dé here has the meaning 'Indians'. It also means 'man, men, person, Apache'; the exact meaning depending upon the contrast desired. hinahédaał , 2nd person dual of ho -[or hi-]ni-...-gh é 'to be called, named' [imp. neut. intr.]. -daa ł future tense. 3. 'iłdóͅ 'also'. Here, however, the English sense is better rendered by 'others'. 4. naadinałt'éí 'you who are two'. naa-, reduced form of naaki 'two' [see also naa-din 'twenty' , idin '--ty'] . dinałt'é , 2nd person dual of di-ni-...- ł - t'é 'to be a certain number' [imp. neut. intr.]. This verb is irregular; cf. tá - 'ałt'é 'you are three' [ tá - 'three']; díͅíͅ' - nałt'é 'you are four' [ díͅíͅ' 'four'] 5. 'i n daa 'white men' also 'enemy, hostile' [for example, Chiricahua text 32 it is used to refer to a Comanche war party--MEC]. The function of the prefix 'i- is not clear; cf. shi'i n da' 'my enemy' [shi- 'my']. (6.4) Linguistic Notes 1. káni'jíńłdéélná'a 'he set them down for them, it is said'. ká - 'for them' plus 3a person perf. with indef. obj. of ni-ni...[ni- perf.] ł -dee ł 'to put several down' [act. tr.; ni- 'down, to a stop'; ni- completive]. The theme alone means to cause several objects to move'. 2. n déne 'Indians'. n dé 'Indians' [see note 6.3, §2] plus the enclitic -ne 'people of such and such a group'. 3. ' yáná'dii'iͅiͅgo 'he, choosing for them'. yá - 'for them' plus 3rd person imp. with indef. obj. of ná -di-|...[ni- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ 'to pick up, to choose an unknown object' [act. tr.; ná -di-| 'upward']. The theme - 'iͅiͅ is the verb of handling [see note 2.7, §15] used when the object is unknown [as in this case] or when several objects belonging to more than one classification are being handled [see §5 below]. 4. 'iłtiͅiͅ k'aabił 'gun and bow and arrows'. 'iłtiͅiͅ [also heard 'iłtíͅ ] 'gun, rifle, bow'. This word probably meant originally 'bow' as it sometimes does yet; here, however, it is clear that 'gun' is meant. k'aa 'arrow, bow and arrows, weapons, cartridges'. bi - 'it', - ł 'with'. 5. kánjíń'iͅiͅná'a 'he put them down for them, it is said'. ká - 'for them' plus 3a person perf. of ni- ni...[ni-ni-...[ni- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ 'to put an unknown object down' [act. tr.]. For the prefixes, see §1, above. Here the theme - 'iͅiͅ is used with reference to the handling of objects of differing classifications [see §3, above]. For the bow and arrows alone, the theme - ł -jee 'to handle a group of sticks' is used [see note 6.6, §2], and for the rifle alone, the theme - tiͅiͅ 'to handle a long, slender object' is used [see note 6.7, §3]. (6.6) Linguistic Notes 1. dá'óós'ago 'being a little while later'. dá - 'just'; 'óós'a [also heard 'óós'ah ] 'later'. 2. k'aaí ndé yánáinłjeená'a 'he chose the bow and arrows for the People, it is said'. náinłjee , 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of ná -di-|...[ni- perf.]- ł - jee 'to pick up a group of sticks' [act. tr.]. For prefixes, see note 1.22, §1. Since the object handled is here definitely known and of one classification, the theme - 'iͅiͅ is no longer used [see note 6.4, §5]. 3. 'ádíídíínábégóziͅ 'ájílágo 'the making of these is understood'. 'ádíídíí 'these'; oͅ ná 'only'; bégóziͅ , 3rd person of 0 é -go-ni-...- ziͅ 'knowledge about something exists' [imp. neut. intr.]; 'ájílá , 3a person imp. of 'á -...[? perf.]- lá 'to make' [act. tr.]. In this phrase, the subordinated verb follows the principal verb; the reverse order is more usual. (6.7) Linguistic Notes 1. bich'áͅná'shn'iͅiͅí 'that which remained'. bich'áͅ 'from it' plus 3a person perf. with indef. obj. of ná -di-|...{ni- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ 'to pick up an unknown object' [act. tr.], and - í relative. Literally: 'that from which he had picked up something'. 2. dooyáłtidahe 'without saying anything'. yáłti , 3rd person imp. of yá -...[hi- perf.]- ł -ti 'to speak' [act. intr.; yá - thematic prefix]. I do not understand the function of the ending -he. 3. náintáͅná'a 'he picked it up, it is said'. 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of ná - di -|...[ni- perf.]- tiͅiͅ 'to pick up a long slender object' [act. tr.]. See note 6.4, §5 and 6.6. §2. (6.8) Linguistic Notes 1. łi' 'one, the other' plus - í relative. 2. gońłch'ilná'a 'there was a heavy growth of vegetation, it is said'. go- place subject plus ńłch'il 'it is leafy, branchy; there is much vegetation'. This verb appears only in the 3rd person so analysis is difficult. However, it looks like a 3rd person ni- perf. neut. intr. 3. bidáń 'their food'; cf. dáń 'food'. 4. dá'ákodeeyá nánt'íͅíͅ 'wild growing things' dá'ákodeeyá 'wild, uncultivated' [part:]. nánt'íͅíͅ , 3rd person iter. of ni -... [si- perf.]-t' áͅ 'to grow, to ripen' [act. intr.; ni- terminative]. Literally: 'those which customarily grow wild'. 5. dziłátaazheí 'wild turkeys'. dził 'mountain'; - á , reduced form of - yá pp.; taazhe 'chicken'. 6. dádiłkoͅoͅdego 'it being absolutely barren'. dá - 'absolutely'. dádiłkoͅoͅdego , 3rd person of di-...- ł - koͅoͅ [or - koͅde ] 'to be smooth, to be barren' [imp. neut. intr.]. In the first and second persons singular and in the 2nd person dual of this verb, the prefix appears to be ni- rather than di-. There are apparently three sets of adjectival prefixes in Chiricahua: ni-, di-, and di-ni-, which are often confused. 7. hich'áͅná'n'iͅiͅná'a 'he chose [the former mountain] it is said'. Literally: 'he chose one away from it', 'it' referring to the barren mountain. For analysis, see 6.7, §1. (6.9) Linguistic Notes 1. 'iłch'áͅ'ádzaaná'a 'it spread apart, it is said'. 'ił - reciprocal; - ch'áͅ 'away, from'; 'ájaa , 3rd person perf. of 'á -...[? perf.]- n dá 'to do' [pass. of - lá 'to do']. 2. łíní 'horses'; łíͅ plus relative - í . The -n- occurs as the result of adding a vocalic suffix to a stem with nasalized vowel. This, however, does not always happen; łíͅí also occurs. 3. dzaa n deezí dásídanzhóníná 'the very best mules'. dzaa n deezí 'mules', is also given tsaa n deezí . The former can be analyzed as jaa- 'ear' [becoming dzaa- by assimilation to the -z- following], - n deez 'long' [compounded form of the verb ni-... - n deez 'to be long'], and - í relative. tsaa-, however, is meaningless. dásí - 'very'; danzhóní , relative of danzhóͅ , 3rd person distrib. of ni-...- zhóͅ 'to be good' [imp. neut. intr.]; - ná 'just, only'. 4. dibéhé 'sheep'. 5. góochi 'pigs', one of the rare Chiricahua words which has been borrowed from Spanish. Cf. Spanish cochino . 6. ch'énádaaheesáͅná'a 'they came out, it is said'. 3rd person distrib. of ch'é - ná -hi-...[si- perf.]- ł - zé 'a group moves out en masse' [act. intr.; ch'é - 'out'; ná - thematic ? ; hi- ?]. - ł - combines with the stem initial. 7. baa'shdóó'iͅiͅná'a 'he had given them things, it is said'. 3a person perf. with indef. obj. of 0aa-di- ...[hi- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ 'to give an unknown object to someone' [act. intr.; aa- 'to'; di- ?]. (6.10) Linguistic Notes 1. yeehi n dáná'a 'he lives on them, it is said'. yee- 'with them, by means of them' plus 3rd person of hi-...- n d á 'to live, to be alive' [imp. neut. intr.]. hi- ? is, in some persons, replaced by ni- adj. (6.11) Linguistic Notes 1. naa'iziigo 'they, working'. 3rd person cont. imp. with indef. obj. of naa-|...[si- perf.]- zí 'to do with, to meddle with, to handle' [act. tr.; naa-| 'about, here and there']. To work is, therefore, to go about handling things. 2. ná'nłt'íͅí 'cultivated plants'. 3rd person iter. with indef. obj. of ni-...[si- perf.]- ł - t'áͅ 'to raise, cultivate, grow' [act. tr.] plus the relative - í . Cf. note 6.8, §4. 3. hich'áͅshíͅ 'on them'. hi- variant 3rd person pronoun; - ch'áͅ 'from, away'; - shíͅ 'from'. (6.12) Linguistic Notes 1. 'iłch'áͅ'aa n dahyá 'very far apart'. 'iłch'áͅ 'from one another' plus 3rd person of 'aa-ni-...- n dah 'to be far away' [imp. neut. intr.]. 'aa - ?; ni- adj., disappears in the 3rd, 3a, 1st dual, and 2nd dual persons. 2. tógonásga'í 'ocean'. tó 'water'. gonásga' , bound form of gonásga , place subject of ná -...-ga 'whiteness extends in a circle' [si- perf. neut. intr.; ná - 'around, in a circle']. Literally: 'white water that extends in a circle'. [what Hoijer refers to as 'white' here can also be translated 'clear', 'transparent'- MEC] 3. hanan 'across' [part.]. 4. 'iłiyaałtsééłee 'as you see one another'. 3rd person prog. with reciprocal pronoun of hi-|...[ni- perf.]- ł - tséé 'to see, catch sight of [act. tr.] plus -ee 'at'. 'iłiyaał - &gt; 'ił - plus hi- plus haa- plus - ł -. 5. naagonałdzoodaał 'you will fight'. 2nd person dual imp. of naa-go-ni-...[si- perf.]- ł -dzoo 'to fight, to go to war' [act. intr.; prefixes indefinable]. - daał future tense enclitic. Why the future tense enclitic instead of the future paradigm should be used here, I cannot say. Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 The creation of human beings from mud is not a common element of Chiricahua mythology. Most informants cannot give any account of the creation of man. Ethnological Note 2 See note 1.3. Ethnological Note 3 The speaker here is Child of the Water.</field>
