Ch'édégoda 'ádailáná'a. Dá'át'égo daajiyáͅí dooyédaagósiͅdaná'a. Dádatł'izhgo 'ísaa yóó n dilná'a. Hibéézhgo 'ii'óó'áͅná'a. Gahéeí 'it'a ntł'izná'a. T'óosibéézhdaná'a. 'Iyáa'át'éí dooyédaagósiͅdaná'a. They had a camp. From somewhere they had brought back some coffee. They didn't [know] what to do with it. They did not know how it was eaten. They had put it in a pot still green. It had boiled all day. The coffee was still hard. It had not been cooked. They didn't know what it was. Then this Mescalero who lived among them came there. (28.2) 'Ákoo 'ádíń Mashgaléń gotanlíͅń 'áá'híłghoná'a. Gahéeí dádatł'izhgo daajiłbéézhí yiiłtsáͅná'a. Then this Mescalero who lived among them came there. He saw the still green coffee that they had boiled. Then he spoke thus: (28.3) 'Ákoo 'á n diná'a: "Áí gahéeí łi' 'inahjáásh. 'Aaí doo'ághát'égo daajiyáͅda." daagooł n diná'a. Then he spoke thus: "Give me some of that coffee. That is not the way they eat it." Then he roasted the coffee that they had given him. (28.4) 'Ákoo gahéeí baajíńjaaí yiist'éná'a. Dádaajinéł'íͅgo, hita'iis n diná'a. Tsíyóó'áͅná'a. Gahée yiisbéézhná'a. 'Iłch'áͅyiis'áͅná'a. Sibéézhgo, káyaadayaa n dííłná'a. Then he roasted the coffee that they had given him. As they watched, he pounded it. He put it on the fire. He boiled coffee. He took it off the fire. Still boiling, he poured it for the them. "This is the way they eat it." (28.5) "'Ádíídíí kát'égo daajiyáͅ." daagoołdiná'a. 'Ákoo bédaagojoosiͅná'a. "This is the way they eat it." he said to them. Then they had learned about it. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (28.1) Linguistic Notes 1. dádatł'izhgo 'still green'. dá - 'just' plus: 3rd person of da-ni-...- tł'izh 'to be green, to be blue' [imp. newt. intr.]. 2. 'ísaa yóó n dilná'a 'they put it in a pot'. 'ísaa 'pot'. yóó n dil should probably be bee 'iyóó n dil , 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of 'i- |...[hi- perf.]- n dííł 'to put several objects away' [act. tr.]. 3. hibéézhgo 'it, boiling'. 3rd person imo. of ...[si- perf.]- béézh 'to boil' [act. intr.]. In the line below is the 3rd person perf. of this verb and in passages 2 and 4 of this text may be found the causative: ...[si- perf.]- ł - béézh 'to boil' [act. tr.]. (28.4) Linguistic Notes 1. hita'iis n diná'a 'he pounded it'. 3rd person perf. of ta-'i- ...[si- perf.]- ł - n dii 'to pound, to crush, to pulverize'. The pronoun before t'a- occurs only in the 3rd person. Cf. hi- |...[si- perf.]- ł - n dii 'to hit, strike' [act. tr.]. 2. 'iłch'áͅyiis'áͅná'a 'he took it off the fire'. I do not understand this form. It seems to me to be 'iłch'áͅ 'from each other' plus yiis'áͅ 'he has caused a round object to move'. 3. káyaadayaa n dííłná'a 'he poured it for them'. I cannot analyze the prefix complex. The stem looks like the imp. stem of - n dííł 'to handle several objects' [act. tr.].</field>
