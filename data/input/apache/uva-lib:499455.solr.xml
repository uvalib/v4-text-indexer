Then he removed all of the intestines of this Bull he had killed. And he poured all of the blood of that same Bull into them. Then, [to] his mother, the White Painted Woman, he spoke thus [to her]: (4.2) Nágo gomáń, `Isdzánádleeshénń, `áałji n díná'a: Shimá, k'adi `áń `Itsá bi n dáayee'igháͅáͅ'ń, n dé doobáńgólaadań, bich'iͅiͅnáádiyeesdzá." Tóbájishchinéń gooł n díná'a. `Ákoo bich'iͅiͅshdiyeesdzáná'a. Then, [to] his mother, the White Painted Woman, he spoke thus [to her]: "My mother, now [to] that Eagle who kills with his eyes, he who will not permit people to live, I am going [to him] also." Child of the Water said to her. And he started off to him. Then, now, to the plain; (4.3) `Ákoo, `áńdeeda, gołgazhiͅ; `it'ago gołgazhiͅ ch'éjí n dádadáͅ, 'áí `ich'íí' `idiłe beehadaashdeesbiͅ'ní gokáshíͅ díík'een. `Ákoo `áńdeeda gołgazhiͅ bách'éjíńyáná'a. Then, now, to the plain; [but] before he went out to the plain, he wound those intestines he had filled with blood all around him[self]. And then he went out to the plain for [the Eagle]. 1 Then, [the Eagle], from over there at the rock that extends to the sky on which he lies with his children looking in every direction-- where he sits searching for something to come out somewhere--saw him. (4.4) `Ákoo, `ághashíͅ tséyáłt'ahoó'áshíͅ bizhaa hiłdasijéshíͅ `iłch'áͅgo dees'íͅgo -- iyáada ha'yáda ch'é n dáí híkádees'íͅgo dasidáshíͅ -- goołtsáͅná'a. Dágóoshch'iͅiͅ góńgoná'a. Goghádeełch'iná'a.

Then, [the Eagle], from over there at the rock that extends to the sky on which he lies with his children looking in every direction-- where he sits searching for something to come out somewhere--saw him. Suddenly he swooped down. He grabbed him with his claws. Immediately, at that place, blood began to flow. He picked him up. He carried him back over there to the rock that extends to the sky on which his children lay. Then he threw him over to where his children were sitting. (4.5) 'Ákoo bizhaaí naaheestáͅzhiͅ hich'iͅiͅ'iyóółt'ená'a. Biche'shkénéí 'ádaił n díná'a: "'Aaí haͅh k'adi daahałghał !" yiił n díná'a. 'Ákoo bí 'áshíͅ tsédees'áshíͅ dahnándaanshíͅ dahnáneesdáná'a. Then he threw him over to where his children were sitting. He spoke thus to his children: "Eat this up quickly!" he said to them. Then he sat down again on the place on the extended rock on which he usually sat. Then his children began to eat. (4.6) Nágo biche'shkénéní 'eedaa'niiłghałná'a. Nágo bich'iͅiͅshdidees n diiná'a. Nágo: "Ssss---!" biłji n díná'a. Nágo biłdaagóghéná'a. Then his children began to eat. And they reached out to [Child of the Water]. Then: "Sss---!" he said to them. Then they were afraid. They called over there to where their father was sitting: (4.7) Gháshíͅ bitaań dasidánń dááyózhíná'a. "Shitaa, 'ádíń 'Sss ---! ' nahiił n dí !" "Nóóghoyáhaͅh daahałghał They called over there to where their father was sitting: "My father, this one said 'Sss---!' to us!"

Nágo, dá'ághádaagołdees n diidáͅ, ko'yá ha'yá 'ináánóot'aná'a. Then their father spoke thus to them: "Go right ahead [and] eat him! That one died long ago. That noise is the air coming out of his wounds." their father said to them. And, just as he had told them this, he flew away somewhere again. Then Child of the Water took out a stone axe which lay in his pocket. (4.9) Nágo Tóbájiishchinéń tséghe'si'áͅí bit'ahá si'áͅí hayóó'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo yéégotaazhiis n diná'a. Naagoostseená'a.

Only that one which was born last he spared. Then Child of the Water asked that one who was born last: (4.10) Nágo Tóbájiishchinéń 'áń 'iké'naaghánń hííshdiłkiná'a: "Ntaań háá'go nnáhadááł?" biłji n díná'a. Then Child of the Water asked that one who was born last: "When Is your father returning?" he said to him. Then that little one spoke thus to him: (4.11) 'Ákoó 'áń bizáͅáͅyéń 'ágooł n díná'a: "Ńłtsáͅbikaͅ'í daadikágo tóbizholeí daasdi n dííłgo, nnáhadááł." gooł n díná'a. Then that little one spoke thus to him: "When the male rain 2 starts to come [and] the water dust starts to fall, he will return." he said to him. Then: (4.12) 'Ákoo: "Ha'áshíͅ dahnándaa?" biłjí n díná'a. Then: "Where does he usually sit?" said [Child of the Water] to him. "Over there, at that point of rock, he usually sits." (4.13) "'Aashíͅ, tsédees'áshíͅ, dahnándaa." gooł n díná'a. "Over there, at that point of rock, he usually sits." he said to him. Then now, he lay in wait for [Eagle] at the place where [the little one] had told him he usually sat. (4.14) 'Ákoo 'áńdeeda, 'áshíͅ dahnándaa ji n dínshíͅ bandziyeedzáná'a.

Then now, he lay in wait for [Eagle] at the place where [the little one] had told him he usually sat. Then, as [Eagle] swooped back to that place, there was a great noise. There, at the place where he usually sat, he alighted. Before he noticed him, [Child of the Water] hit him on the side of the head with the stone axe. He knocked him off [the rock]. Then he questioned the little one again. (4.15) Nágo 'áń bizáͅáͅyéń nááhíshdiłkiná'a. "K'adi, nmá háá'go nnáhadááł?" biłji n díná'a. Then he questioned the little one again.

"When the female rain 3 starts to come [and] the water dust starts to fall, she will return." he said to him. Then: (4.17) `Ákoo: "Ha'áshíͅ dahnándaa?" náábiłjidih n díná'a. Then: "Where does she usually sit?" he said to him also. "Over there, at that point of rock, she usually sits." (4.18) " `Aashíͅ, tsédees'áshíͅ, dahnáńndaa." gooł n díná'a. "Over there, at that point of rock, she usually sits." he said to him. Then he lay in wait there for her also. (4.19) `Ákoo, `áshíͅ bánáádziyeedzáná'a. Ko'shíͅ hogo hiiłch'aná'a.

From far away was heard the noise of her flying. She was swooping down to her perch. Before she noticed him, [Child of the Water] hit her also on the side of the head. He knocked her off [the rock]. He killed her. Then that little one, the one he had spared, he spoke thus to him: (4.20) `Ákoo `áń bizáͅáͅyénń, `inájiisiͅiͅnń, `áałji n díná'a: `K'adi, isda' náshígee." biłji n díná'a. Then that little one, the one he had spared, he spoke thus to him: "Now, you carry me down." he said to him. So then he started to carry [Child of the Water] down again.

He had carried him down. There [Child of the Water] hit his head also. He killed him. Then he was pulling out [the Eagles'] feathers. (4.22) `Ákoo bit'aí baahajiya n dishná'a.

"Let these become all varieties of birds!" he said as he scattered them in all directions. By that [act] he created all of the different birds that exist. Then he returned to his mother again. (4.23) `Áshíͅ gomáń baanáájidzáná'a. "Shimá, `áń gobóógháͅ." biłji n díná'a. Then he returned to his mother again. "My mother, I have killed them." he said to her. And his mother was very happy about it. (4.24) Nágo gománń ka'iłéńziͅná'a. "'Ihéhee, shishke'e !" gooł n díná'a. And his mother was very happy about it. "That is good, my child!" she said to him.

(4.16) Linguistic Notes ńłtsáͅbi'áí 'female rain' [see Ethnological Notes to Chiricahua text 4, note 2]. ńłtsáͅ 'rain' [archaic]; bi'á 'female, its female-ness'. See note 4.11, §l. (4.19) Linguistic Notes 1.

Since the iter. and imp. stems are identical in this verb, it is impossible to distinguish, in form, the cust. and imp. modes [see Grammatical Sketch, §17]. But the context here makes it likely that the form, which means literally 'to where she usually sat', should be interpreted as of the cust. mode. (4.20) Linguistic Notes 'isda' náshígee you carry me down'. 3rd person imp. with lst person obj. of' 'isda'-n á -...[hi- perf.]-d-ghee 'to carry a burden down again' [act. tr.]. 'isda' 'down, off' a particle functioning here as a verb prefix. n á - 'again' requires the -d- class. (4.21) Linguistic Notes 1. hanyaa 'down' [part.]. Cf. -yaa 'down, below, under' [pp.]. 2. nágodeesgíͅná'a 'he had started to carry him again, it is said'. 3rd person perf. with 3a obj. of ná -di-...[si- perf.]-d-ghee 'to start to carry a burden again' [act. tr.]. ná - 'again', di- inceptive. Cf. note 4.20. Note, also, in the next line, 'isda' nágagíͅná'a 'he had carried him down again, it is said'. This is the 3rd person perf. with 3a obj. of the verb analyzed in 4.20. The irregularity in the 3rd person of the hi- perf. is characteristic of -d- verbs. (4.22) Linguistic Notes 1. bit'aí 'their feathers'. -t'aa 'feathers' [also heard -t'a']. 2. baahajiya n dishná'a 'he was pulling them out of them,'it is said'. baa- 'of them, from them' . hajiya n dish , 3a person prog. of ha-hi-...[si- perf.]- n dish 'to pull, pluck out' [act. tr.; ha- 'out', hi- ?]. hajiya &gt; ha-ji-hi-ya. 3.

Cf. this phrase, i. e. 'izháshee'ił'ango 'ádaat'éí 'those different birds that exist', with that analyzed in §3, this note. (4.23) Linguistic Notes 1. gobóógháͅ 'I have killed them. 1st person perf. with 3rd person dual obj. of ...[hi- perf.]-gh áͅ 'to kill several' [act. tr.]. This is one of the rare cases of the use of the separate 3rd person dual object pronoun. Note, too, that it refers to a number greater than two [see Grammatical Sketch, §11].
