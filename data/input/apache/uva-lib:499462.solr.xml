'Íńtinshíͅ ditsiͅ'óó'áí bitł'áshíͅ neesdáná'a. 'Aashíͅ sidágo 'a'ááłná'a. Coyote was walking [along] a road. He sat down under a tree that was standing by the road. There he sat for some time. Then he put several [silver] dollars upon the tree that was standing there. (11.2) Nágo ditsiͅ'óó'áí bééso yaadahyees n diłná'a. Then he put several [silver] dollars upon the tree that was standing there. Then two white men came along the road driving a pack [train]. (11.3) Nágo 'íńtinshíͅ 'i n daa naaki hééł yił'inayołná'a. 'Aashíͅ, 'íńtinshíͅ ditsiͅ'óó'áí bitł'ashíͅ, sidáná'a. Hééł baabił'inéńyooná'a. 'I n daań 'ábiił n diná'a: "'Iyáabáͅáͅ dá'kodeshíͅ síndá?" biił n díná'a. Then two white men came along the road driving a pack [train]. There, under a tree that was standing by the side of the road, he sat. They drove the pack [train] to him. The white men spoke thus to him: "Why are you sitting in this lonely place?" they said to him. "Well," (11.4) "Dooda," n diná'a. "'Ádíí ditsiͅ'óó'áí baasídá." n diná'a. "Díí ditsiͅí bééso baanánt'íͅ. 'Áíbaͅaͅ, shiłnzhóͅ." n diná'a. "Well," he said. "I sit guarding this tree that stands here." he said. "Money grows on this tree. For that reason, it is valuable to me." he said. The white men spoke thus to him: (11.5) 'I n daań 'ábiił n diná'a: "Naanaahiił n dii." biił n diná'a. The white men spoke thus to him: "We will buy it from you." they said to him. Then he spoke thus: (11.6) Nágo 'á n diná'a: "Dooda, dáͅ'ayáłáͅí 'ílíͅ." yiił n diná'a. Then he spoke thus: "No, it is worth a great deal." he said to them. Then the white men spoke thus to him: (11.7) Nágo 'i n daań 'ábiił n diná'a: "Ádíídíí łíͅí dá'łk'eh daadaho n dééłgo 'áshíͅ díí hééłí biłnoodzołí díík'eh nan n dííłgo 'aaí ditsiní nahaadéń'aa." gołgo n diná'a. "'Íͅíͅyaͅaͅda ditsiͅí nghá; bééso naaniidá hálí." gołgo n diná'a. Then the white men spoke thus to him: "We will give you both these horses with their burdens and all of these pack [animals] that we are driving if you will give us that tree." they said to him. "But shake the tree; let's see if money will fall." they said to him. Then Coyote spoke thus to them: (11.8) Nágo Ma'yeń 'ágooł n diná'a: "'Ao, ditsiͅí hishxá." Dá'kogo ditsiͅi yóógháná'a. Bééso hiká dahyees n dilní łi' naaneesdaná'a. Then Coyote spoke thus to them: "Yes, I'll shake the tree." And then he shook the tree. Some of the money he had put upon it fell down. Then they gave him all of that with which they had been travelling. (11.9) Nágo beeja'ashní díík'eh baajíń n dilná'a. Then they gave him all of that with which they had been travelling. Then Coyote spoke thus to them: (11.10) Nágo Ma'yeń 'ágooł n diná'a: "'Ághaí ghashíͅ dziłntsaaí si'áͅ'ííyéí bitis 'i'nóóyoogo, 'áńdeeda ditsíͅí hahá. 'Ákoo béésoí naaneesdaago náhałá." gooł n diná'a. Then Coyote spoke thus to them: "When I have driven [the pack train] across that big mountain that lies at that place yonder, then you shake the tree. Then pick up the money that has fallen off." he said to them. And now he began to drive [the pack train] away from them. (11.11) 'Ákoo 'áńdeeda goch'áͅ'íńdeeyooná'a. 'Ágołji n diní bitis 'i'jinóóyooná'a. And now he began to drive [the pack train] away from them. He drove it across [the mountain] as he had said. Then the white men got up. (11.12) Nágo 'i n daanń nádiit'áázhná'a. Ditsiͅí yighágo yaanaa'aashná'a. Dooyáanoot'iͅiͅdaná'a. Joojibááyégo, ditsiͅ'óó'áí bitłáhee naajiyee'aashná'a. Gołgóótoͅoͅná'a. Bike'shdiyeest'áázhná'a. Then the white men got up. They shook the tree for a long time. Nothing fell down. In a pitiable state, they stood about under the tree that was standing there. They became angry. They started to go after [Coyote]. But he had long ago driven [the pack train] far away. (11.13) 'Ákoo 'iłk'idáͅ ńza'yá 'i'nóóyooná'a. Ma'yeí łáͅgo bigoota ná'ee 'inéńyooná'a. Díík'eh gotaadais n diiná'a. But he had long ago driven [the pack train] far away. He had driven it to a camp of many Coyotes. He had distributed all of it among them. Now those white men were coming to that place. (11.14) 'Ákoo 'áń 'i n daanń ghashíͅ ga'ashná'a. 'Áń Ma'yeí 'ágoł'íͅnń 'íłtsé godáhíłghoná'a. Híshdiłkiná'a.: "'Iͅiͅshíͅ ła'ń hééł hił'inayołń doohaaóó'íͅda?" biłji n diná'a. Now those white men were coming to that place. That Coyote who had done so to them met them first. They asked him: "You haven't seen over here someone who was driving a pack [train]?" they said to him. Coyote spoke thus to them: (11.15) Ma'yeń 'ágooł n diná'a: "'Aashíͅ 'á n deedego hoshááł ndah dooyáahosh'íͅdaa. Haadeń naadaagoka." gooł n diná'a. Coyote spoke thus to them: "I was walking over here a while ago but I saw no one. [I don't know] where they went." he said to them. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (11.1) Linguistic Notes 1. Mai 'íńtin hołghołná'a 'Coyote was walkinging along a road, it is said'. mai 'coyote'; 'íńtin 'road'; hołghoł , 3rd person prog. of -l-ghee 'to move' [act, intr.]. Note that the noun 'íńtin has no postposition indicating its relationship to the verb. This is unusual. 2. ditsiͅ'óó'áí 'a tree that was standing'. ditsiͅ 'tree' plus 'óó'á , 3rd person indef. of - 'á , rigid object extends [upward]' [hi- perf. neut. intr.], and the relative - í . (11.2) Linguistic Notes 1. bééso 'money, dollars' &gt; Spanish peso . We know the reference here to be to several pieces of money because the verb that follows is used only to refer to several discrete objects. 2. yaadahyees n diłná'a 'he put them upon it, it is said'. 3rd person perf. with 3rd person obj. of 0aa-dah-hi-...[si- perf.]- n dííł 'to put several object on to something' [act. tr.; aa- 'to'; dah- 'on'; hi- ?]. (11.3) Linguistic Notes 1. hééł yił'inayołná'a 'they came driving a pack [train], it is said'. hééł 'pack, burden'. 'inayoł is the 3rd person prog. with indef, obj. of the verb theme ni-... yó 'to drive, herd [animals]' [act. tr.]. The prefix ni- is thematic but only in the progressive mode does it occur with no other derivational prefixes. The text form means literally: 'they were driving (animals) with burdens, it is said'. 2. hééł baabił'inéńyooná'a 'they drove the pack [train] to him, it is said'. baa- 'to him'; bił - 'with them'; 'i- indefinite obj.; néń - &gt; ni- thematic plus the ni- perfective, 3rd person; -yoo perfective stem. See §1, above. 3. dá'kodéshíͅ [appears as dá'kodeshíͅ in the text--MEC] 'in this lonely place'. 'lonely, wild'. Cf. linguistic note to Chiricahua text 6.8, §4. (11.4) Linguistic Notes 1. dooda means literally 'no, not, none'; see passage 6 of the text. 2. baasídá 'I sit guarding it'. baa- 'to it' plus 1st person of - dá 'one sits' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. 3. ' baanánt'íͅ 'it grows on it'. baa- 'from it' plus 3rd person iter. of ni-...[si- perf.]- táͅ 'to grow' [act. intr.]. 4. shiłnzhóͅ 'it is valuable to me'. shił - 'to me, with me' plus 3rd person of ni-...- zhóͅ 'to be good, beautiful, of value' [imp. neut. intr.]. (11.5) Linguistic Notes naanaahiił n dii 'we will buy it from you'. naa- 'from you' plus 1st person dual of naa-hi- |...[si- perf.]- ł - n dii 'to buy' [act. tr.]. naahi- ? but cf. naa-|...[si- perf.]- n dii 'to give away, to distribute here and there' [act. tr.]. The verb 'to buy' is probably the causative with an extra prefix hi- of 'to give away'. (11.6) Linguistic Notes dáͅ'ayáłáͅí 'ílíͅ 'it is worth a great deal'. dáͅ'ayá 'very much'; łáͅí 'much'. 'ílíͅ , 3rd person of 'i- ni-...- líͅ ; 'to be worth, to be valued at' [imp. newt. intr.]. 'i- ?; ni- adj. (11.7) Linguistic Notes ádíídíí łíͅí dá'łk'eh daadaho n dééłgo 'both these horses with their burdens'. ádíídíí 'these'; łíͅí 'horses'; dá'łk'eh 'both' [see note1.l, §4]. daadaho n dééł , 3rd person distrib. prog. of dah-|...[si- perf.]- n dé 'to move carrying a load' [act. intr.], dah- 'on'; theme alone 'to move'. This is an idiomatic way of describing fully saddled and bridled horses. 2. hééłí biłnoodzołí 'the pack animals that we are driving'. hééłí 'packs'; biłnoodzoł , 1st person dual prog. of the verb analyzed in note 11.3, §1, and - í relative. The -d of the lst person dual combines with the initial stem consonant to form dz-. This is an irregular resultant sound, however [see Grammatical Sketch, part 12], and indicates that this stem initial is historically z- rather than y-. 3. nan n dííłgo 'we, giving them to you'. 1st person dual of 0aa-ni-...[ni- perf.]- n dííł 'to give someone several objects' [act. tr.]. nan- &gt; ni- plus aa- plus the 1st person dual pronoun [see Grammatical Sketch, part 12]. 4. nahaadéń'aa 'you will give it to us'. 2nd person imp. of 0aa-di-ni-...[ni- perf.]-'aa 'to give someone a round object' [act. tr.]. Cf. 0aa-ni-...[ni- perf.]-'aa 'to give someone around object' [act. tr.]. The former differs in that it refers to giving under compulsion or to giving in expectation of a return. 5. nghá 'shake it'. 2nd person imp, of ...[hi- perf.]- ghá 'to,shake' [act. tr.]. 6. naaniidá hálí 'let's see if it will fall'. 3rd person imp, of naa-ni-|...[si- perf.]- dá 'several fall off' [act. intr.]. naa- 'off, down'; ni-| ?; - dá 'several objects move through space'. hálí , a modal particle denoting uncertainty or doubt. (11.9) Linguistic Notes beeja'ashní Of 'that with which they had been traveling'. bee- 'with it, by means of it'; ja'ash, 3a person prog. of -'aash 'two move'; -n past tense; - í relative. (11.10) Linguistic Notes 1. si'áͅ'ííyéí 'that lies at that place yonder'. si'áͅ 'a round object lies' [3rd person si- perf. neut,intr.]; - 'ííyé 'over yonder' [encl.]. 2. 'i'nóóyoogo 'when I have driven them'. 3rd person perf, with indef. obj. of i-ni-...[hi- perf.]- yó 'to drive [animals] off, away' [act. tr.; 'i- 'away'; ni- thematic]. Cf. linguistic note to Chirichua text 11.3, §§1,2 3. náhałá 'you pick it up'. 2nd person dual imp. of ná -hi-...[si- perf.]- lá 'to pick up several scattered objects' [act. tr.]. The theme occurs only with these prefixes. The final -h of the 2nd person dual pronoun unvoices the stem initial. (11.11) Linguistic Notes goch'áͅ'íńdeeyooná'a 'he began to drive them away from them, it is said'. goch'áͅ 'from them' plus 3rd person perf. of 'i-ni-di-...[si- perf.]- yó 'to begin to drive animals away'. 'i- 'away' plus ni- thematic apparently results in ' 'íń - but perhaps this is misheard for ' 'iń -. The verb seems to be intr.; cf. notes 11.10, §2 and 11.3, §§1, 2. (11.12) Linguistic Notes 1. nádiit'áázhná'a 'they got up, it is said'. 3rd person perf. of ná -di-|...[ni- perf.]-d-'aash 'two arise, get up' [act. intr.]. ná -di-| 'upward'; -'aash 'two move'. Why has this verb the -d- class? 2. yighágo yaanaa'aashná'a 'they shook it for a long time, it is said'. yighá 'they shook it' [see note 11.7, §5]. yaa- 'about it' plus 3rd person imp. of naa-|...[si- perf.]-'aash 'two go about, here and there' [act. intr.]. Literally: 'they, shaking it, they went on about it'. 3. dooyáanoot'iͅiͅdaná'a 'nothing fell down, it is said'. yáa 'something' plus perf. of naa-|...[hi- perf.]-d- 'iͅiͅ 'an unknown object falls down' [pass.; naa- 'down']. 4. joojibááyégo 'in a pitiable state'. 3a person of joo-ni-...- bááyé 'to be in a pitiable state' [imp. neut. intr.]. joo- is also used with - n dee 'to help, assist', see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 5.6; §2; ni- adj. The latter prefix disappears entirely in the 3rd and 3a persons. 5. naajiyee'aashná'a 'they stood about, it is said'. This is the 3a person of a verb found only in the imp. mode. The other persons are: naaheet'ash 'we stand about'; naahaah'aash 'you two stand about'. The stem is apparently -'aash 'two move' [act. intr.] but the prefixes are puzzling. 6. bike'shdiyeest'áázhná'a 'they started to go after him, it is said'. bike 'after him' plus 3rd person perf. of di-yi-...[si- perf.]-d-'aash 'two start off' [act. intr.]. Prefixes indefinable; cf. linguistic note to Chiricahua text 3.2, §2. (11.13) Linguistic Notes 1. bigoota 'their camp'. 2 ná'ee 'at that place'. ná - 'that place' plus -ee 'at, on'. 3. gotaadais n diiná'a 'he had distributed them among them, it is said'. 3rd person perf. with 3rd person distrib. obj. of 0-taa-|...[si- perf.]- n dii 'to distribute things among' [act. tr.; -taa 'among']. (11.14) Linguistic Notes 1. godáhíłghoná'a 'he met them, it is said'. 3rd person perf. of 0- dá -ni-...[ni- perf.]-l-ghee 'to meet, encounter someone' [act. intr.]. -da 'before, in front of'; ni- completive. Literally 'to come before someone'. 2. doohaaóó'íͅda 'you haven't seen anyone'. haa- 'anyone, someone' plus 2nd person of - 'íͅ 'to see' [prog. neut. tr.]. (11.15) Linguistic Notes 'á n deedego 'a while ago'. Possibly 'á n deede is an older form of 'á n dee 'it is new, recent' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 1.18, §3]. Cf. also 'á n deeda 'then, now' [part.].</field>
