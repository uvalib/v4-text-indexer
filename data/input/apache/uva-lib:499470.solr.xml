(19.1) 'Iłk'idáͅ, 'á n deenaagoghádáͅ, n dé łáͅná'a. Gáͅhé hooghéí doohádáͅ'iyáayégósiͅdaná'a. n Dé dáhóołe'é yégósiͅná'ań 'aaee n déłáͅíghe'é naagháná ndah doobédaagojísiͅdaná'a. Long ago, when everything was new, there were many Indians. No one at that time knew anything about those who are called Mountain Spirits 1 Only one man who knew about them lived among the many people but they did not know about him. Then that man who knew about the Mountain Spirits talked to them: (19.2) 'Ákoo 'áń n déń Gáͅhé yégósiͅń goch'iͅiͅyádaałtiná'a. "Gotál nt'aa tł'éé'go, Gáͅhé nahá'ágoshłá.

Then that man who knew about the Mountain Spirits talked to them: "There is to be a ceremony. Tonight, I will make Mountain Spirits for you. The ceremony lasts four nights; I will make for you something you have never seen before. Therefore, all of you go there." he said to them. Then the people spoke thus: (19.3) 'Ákoo n déí ádaaji n díná'a: 'Iłch'iͅiͅyádaajiłtiná'a: "Dá'ákanzhóͅ. Díí doohádóͅoͅt'íͅdaí n dé nahá'áiláí bá'iłénasiͅgo nzhóͅ.

Then the people spoke thus: They talked to one another: "It is well. It is well that you be grateful for that which the man is to do for us which we have never seen before. It is proper that we do for the man whatever the man tells us." they said to one another as they talked to one another. "Therefore, all of you, every last one of you, will go there." they said to one another. Then this man, he who knew about the Mountain Spirits [and] was going to make them for them, again talked to them. (19.4) Nágo 'ádíń n déń Gáͅhé yégóiͅgo Gáͅhé ká'ádaagoláń. goch'iͅiͅyánáádaałtiná'a. 'Ádaagooł n díná'a: "Shik'ishókéne, shílaͅgókéne: 'Ádíídíí Gáͅhé 'ágoshłáí 'ághahyá 'aa n dahyá dziłí bit'ahyá 'áshłá. Hííyaada gózhóͅgo nahche'shkéneí naht'ékéneí baadaahah n dí.

He spoke thus to them: "My brothers, my sisters: I will make these Mountain Spirits that I'm going to make far away over there at the foot of the mountain 2 . So advise your children [and] your relatives well. No one is to come close to these Mountain Spirits which I will make [and] decorate. Do not call these people I will make into Mountain Spirits by their names even if you recognize them. My relatives, it is dangerous [for] anyone to speak [so]. Forbid your children [to do so]. No one is to go where these Mountain Spirits are being decorated. No one is to look at them 3 . If you see them only at twilight coming out to the fire, it is perfectly all right. But treat them with respect 4 . No one is to speak carelessly. Forbid your children [to do so]. No one is to say anything. It is dangerous [for] anyone to speak thus. My relatives, I plead with you." he said to them. In a good way, in exactly that way, he had made it known to them. (19.5) Gózhóͅgo, ha'yá dásí'ágót'éyá, beegoch'adaagojiischíͅná'a. 'Áń n déń Gáͅhé 'ágoláń yeekaadaoh n diiná'a. In a good way, in exactly that way, he had made it known to them. That man who was to make the Mountain Spirits advised them [well]. Now then, making use of some of those people who were with him, he made the Mountain Spirits. (19.6) Nágo k'adi, dá'áí bił n déjílíͅí łi' chidaajoos'iͅiͅgo, Gáͅhé 'ájílaaná'a. 'Aa n dahyá, dziłí bit'ahyá, dooháshíͅ'áháánédaya, Gáͅhé bánáá'jinees n dilná'a. 'Ákaa Gáͅhé k'e'jiłchíná'a. Now then, making use of some of those people who were with him, he made the Mountain Spirits. Far away, at the foot of the mountain, where no one was near, he made a brush corral for the Mountain Spirits. There he decorated the Mountain Spirits. Then some children [who] were playing ran about all over. (19.7) Ákoo díí 'áłchinéneí, naadaa n déhégo, díík'een 'iłnánákeená'a. 'Dooháń 'ázhíͅ daahígháda', ji n dígo n débee bich'iͅiͅyádaajóółtiní, dá'ádáͅ bich'iͅiͅyágo 'áłchinéne 'iłnánákeená'a naadaa n déhégo. Then some children [who] were playing ran about all over. Though he had said "No one is to go there," when he had spoken to the people, the children were already running about playing [close] to [that place]. Then one young girl came out near the Mountain Spirits who were being decorated. (19.8) Nágo łi' jeejíkéͅí Gáͅhé k'edaa'jiłchíí biyeeshxahá ch'éjíłghee.

Then one young girl came out near the Mountain Spirits who were being decorated. And she turned her head toward the Mountain Spirits who were being decorated there. And that young girl saw one of the men she knew. She recognized him. Then, at twilight there was a big fire at the place where the ceremony was to be held. (19.9) Nágo, gołnééjíͅgo, gotál nt'aanee koͅoͅí haadego dasi káͅná'a. Dá'ákodeeyágo jíláͅná'a. Gáͅhé koͅoͅzhoͅoͅkaná'a. Koͅoͅí daisíͅná'a. Báha'dat'áͅná'a. Koͅoͅí daauóósíͅnágo, báha'dat'ááłná'a. Daa'izhishná'a. Nzhóͅgo daa'izhishná'a. Then, at twilight there was a big fire at the place where the ceremony was to be held. There were a great many there. The Mountain Spirits came to the fire. They blessed the fire 5 . The singing had begun for them. When they had blessed the fire, the singing went on for them. They danced. They danced well. Then this one, the one man that the young girl had seen [and] recognized where the Mountains Spirits were being decorated, was pointing around there where the Mountain Spirits were dancing. (19.10) Nágo 'ádíídíí, jeejíkéͅí Gáͅhé k'e'jiłchíee n déłi' bégojísiͅí gojiiłtsáͅní, 'á'naanáájałghołná'a Gáͅhé naanóokééłe. Nágo 'áí jeejíkeͅí díí Gáͅhéí bízhiií beejóózhiiná'a.

Then this one, the one man that the young girl had seen [and] recognized where the Mountains Spirits were being decorated, was pointing around there where the Mountain Spirits were dancing. And that young girl called by name this Mountain Spirit. 6 "That is he who is called so and so." she said. That young girl spoke thus. Then that one who knew about the Mountain Spirits [and] who had made them for the people immediately knew [what she had said] (19.11) Nágo 'áí Gáͅhé bégojísiͅí n dé Gáͅhé bágojilání dágooshch'iͅiͅ kégojiisiͅiͅná'a. Then that one who knew about the Mountain Spirits [and] who had made them for the people immediately knew [what she had said] 7 Then the Mountain Spirits went back out [of sight]. (19.12) Nágo Gáͅhéí haná'anyá 'inájóózhoozh. Nágo n déí díík'eh beebich'agojiischíͅná'a. "'Łáͅ n dá ha'ágoda 'áda n diił hálí', daanałdish n dígo; gózhóͅgo beenahch'adaagosíłchíͅn.

Then the Mountain Spirits went back out [of sight]. And he talked to all of the people. "'No one is to say anything' I told you; I made this known to you in a good way. It is said that someone has already spoken improperly [and] dangerously. Now then, I can in no way make things good again for you. One young girl, while the Mountain Spirits were dancing a while ago, called someone that she recognized by name. I can in no way make things [right] again for you," he said to the people. Then the people pleaded with him (19.13) 'Ákoo n dé daagookaͅaͅná'a. "Chéek'eh, gółdzilgo nahábich'iͅiͅńtł'áás. Doodanaha'áná'idlá." 'áń n déń daahiłji n díná'a. Then the people pleaded with him "Anyhow, help her for us with all your power. [Then] nothing will happen to us." they said to that man. He really tried to help her for them with all his power but it could not be done (19.14) Dá n dí gółdzilgo káich'iͅiͅdeestł'as ndah doodaagoodzaadaná'a. Dách'é'áót'iͅiͅná'a. He really tried to help her for them with all his power but it could not be done 8 He tried in vain. Then that one who had made the Mountain Spirits for them spoke to them. (19.15) Nágo 'áń Gáͅhé kádaagolánń goch'iͅiͅyádaałtiná'a. "'Ádíń jeekéͅń doo'ákaadayá haódzinń díídíí díͅíͅ'tł'éé' gotál si'áͅí hayóółkáͅgo ha'óó'áͅgo doonahi n díida, nałji n dí.

'Łáͅ n dá 'ágháda n diił hálí', 'daanałdish n dín." Then that one who had made the Mountain Spirits for them spoke to them. "This girl who has spoken improperly will not be ours at sunrise on the morning [after] the fourth night of this ceremony, they say to us. Right before your faces just as you are looking on, they will kill her, they say to us. I am unable to make it as it was for you. Long ago, at the very beginning, I made this known to you in a good way. 'No one is to speak so,' I said to you." In spite of that, this man who knew about the Mountain Spirits, by means of his power, tried to help her for them so that nothing would happen to them but he did so in vain. (19.16) Dá'ághát'édah, díń n déń Gáͅhé yégósiͅń, bidighiͅníbee, doodaka'áná'idlágo káich'iͅiͅnáditł'áásná ndah dách'é'áyóół'iͅiͅná'a. Dáhóołeenyágoná biłkégoziͅiͅná'a.

In spite of that, this man who knew about the Mountain Spirits, by means of his power, tried to help her for them so that nothing would happen to them but he did so in vain. He could think of only one thing. Whoever it is who is said to speak to him spoke thus to him: 9 "The morning [after] the fourth night of this ceremony has been finished, put that girl who spoke improperly into a hole you will dig under the fire that lies there where the Mountain Spirits are dancing," he said to him. Ethnological Note Then this man who had made the Mountain Spirits for them made this known to them. (19.17) 'Ákoo díń n déń Gáͅhé ká'adaagolánń yeegoch'adaagooschíͅná'a. Then this man who had made the Mountain Spirits for them made this known to them. Then he also spoke thus to them again: (19.18) 'Ákoo 'iłdóͅ 'ánáádaagooł n díná'a: "'Áhaͅh, goneedlíͅ sał'áͅ. Dooha'yágo 'ájóláhát'éda. Díͅíͅ'tł'éé'í hiiskáͅgo 'ákooná bégodaaziͅiͅł" daagooł n díná'a. Then he also spoke thus to them again: "Go ahead, have a good time. One can do nothing. Only on the morning [after] the fourth night will [anything] be known," he said to them. Then, in just that way, the ceremony went on. (19.19) 'Ákoo dá'ághát'égo, gotál si'áͅná'a. Dá'ághát'éndah doobaagołdaagózhóͅdaná'a. 'Áí jeejíkéͅí dá'áyájízhóͅná'a. Ch'édégoda 'ádaagojiláná'a. Then, in just that way, the ceremony went on. But they did not feel right about it. That young girl was very pretty. They tried in vain to do so Ethnological Note The fourth night came to an end as he had promised them. (19.20) Díͅíͅ'hiłkaaí 'ázhiͅ kágoshdees'áͅní 'aaee ngóńyáná'a.

That morning, many Mountain Spirits from the mountains strung out in a very long line, came to them. (19.21) Hiiskáͅnágo, dziłshíͅgo Gáͅhé łáͅgo, haadeyá ńnáńt'igo, kaanáńsáͅná'a.

That morning, many Mountain Spirits from the mountains strung out in a very long line, came to them. Ethnological Note One Gray One stood at the very end. Ethnological Note These, who were Mountain Spirits from the mountains whom they had never seen, all carried sabres. The Big Black Mountain Spirit stood in the very first place. Ethnological Note Right behind him stood the Big Blue Mountain Spirit. And right behind him stood the Big Yellow Mountain Spirit. At the very end stood the Gray Mountain Spirit. At the place where the ceremony had been held, they blessed the fire that had lain there. (19.22) Gotál si'áͅnee, koͅoͅdasikáͅní daisíͅná'a. Koͅoͅí daayóósíͅná'a. Nágo 'áí jeejíkéͅní gókádantáná'a.

At the place where the ceremony had been held, they blessed the fire that had lain there. They blessed the fire and then they searched for that young girl. They searched for her all over the camp, scattering their furnishings here and there. They searched in vain. At the place where the ceremony had been held, they circled toward the fire several times. (19.23) Gotál si'áͅnee, koͅoͅí hich'íͅíͅnádaadidiłdisná'a. Gáͅhétsodiłhiłń Gáͅhé díík'eh yeesháń sizíͅná'a. Dách'éda biłkégoziͅiͅná'a. 'Ákoo dásí'ikéyá nłghoná'a ch'é'át'íͅgo. At the place where the ceremony had been held, they circled toward the fire several times. The Big Black Mountain Spirit stood before all of the Mountain Spirits. He had tried in vain to learn [where she was]. Then he went to the very end [of the line] since he had failed. Then the Big Blue Mountain Spirit went to the front. (19.24) 'Ákoo Gáͅhétsodatł'izhń 'eesháń nnáánáłghoná'a. Koͅoͅí daisíͅgo, hich'iͅiͅnádaadidiłdisgo, hinóokééłná'a. Gáͅhétsodatł'izhń 'iłdóͅ doobiłkégoziͅiͅdaná'a.

The Big Blue Mountain Spirit also learned nothing. And he also went to the very end. Then the Big Yellow Mountain Spirit went to the front. (19.25) Nágo Gáͅhétsołitsoń 'eesháń nnáánáłghoná'a. Koͅoͅí daisíͅná'a. 'Áń 'iłdóͅ dách'é'áót'iͅiͅná'a. Then the Big Yellow Mountain Spirit went to the front. They blessed the fire. He also did so in vain. Then now, the Gray One went before all of the Mountain Spirits. (19.26) Nágo k'adi, łibáyéí Gáͅhéí díík'eh 'eesháń ńyáná'a. Koͅoͅí díͅíͅn hináskíͅná'a. Díͅíͅn hich'iͅiͅdaadideesdizná'a.

The last time, the fourth time it was done, the Gray One pulled [the girl] out of the center of the fire holding her by the top of her head. As he held her up, all the Mountain Spirits cut her into very small [pieces] with [their] sabres. Circling the fire, they went off. There were many of them. (19.27) Łáͅgo 'ádaat'íͅná'a.

As everyone watched them, they went out from the fire toward the mountains, the sabres clashing and sparkling [in the sun].

Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (19.1) Linguistic Notes 1. 'á n deenaagoghádáͅ 'when everything was new'. 'á n dee 'it is new, recent' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 1.18, §3]; naagoghá 'a place or time moves about, exists' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 1.8, §1]; - dáͅ 'at that time'. 2. Gáͅhé 'Mountain Spirits' [see the ethnological note 1 to linked to the English translation of this story, listed as Ethnological note 19.1]. 3. doohádáͅ'iyáayégósiͅdaná'a 'no one at that time knew anything about them'. há - 'whatever', - dáͅ 'at that time'; 'iyáa 'someone'; yégósiͅ 3rd person of 0 é -go-ni- ...- ł - ziͅ , 'to have knowledge of, to know about' [imp. neut. intr.; é - 'about'; go-ni- ?]. Cf. 0 é -go-ni-...- ziͅ , 'there is knowledge of and ni-...- ziͅ , 'to know, think, feel'. 4. dáhóołe'é 'only one'. Cf. dáłee'é 'one, just one'. 5. n déłáͅíghe'é 'among the many Indians'[also 'among the many People'--MEC]. n dé 'Indians'[also 'People'--MEC]; łáͅ 'many'; -ghe' 'inside, among'. - é is probably the relative - í assimilated to the preceding vowel. (19.2) Linguistic Notes 1. doohádáͅdaah'íͅdaí 'that which you have never seen before'. hádáͅ 'at whatever time' [cf. note 19:1, §3]. daah'íͅ , 2nd person distrib. of 'íͅ , 'to see' [prog. neut. tr.]. 2. 'aaee daanahká you go there'. 'aa- there' plus -ee at'. daanahká , 2nd person distrib. of ni-...[ni- perf.]- ká several go, several come' [act. intr.; ni- completive]. It should be pointed out that the ni- completive prefix gives no indication of direction; it denotes simply that the action is approaching a definite end. Therefore this verb would better be translated 'several move completively [to or from] an end'. Such verbs, it is clear, must be preceded by words denoting the end. In this case, that word is aaee . (19.3) Linguistic Notes 1. dá'ákanzhóͅ 'it is well'. dá'áka &gt; dá'ákaa the final vowel being shortened before -n- plus consonant.

Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 ////The Mountain Spirits are a race of supernaturals who dwell within the interiors of many mountains, according to Chiricahua Apache belief. There they are said to live and conduct their affairs much as the Apache used to do in aboriginal times. The Mountain Spirits conduct a dance and ceremony in which some of their men are masked and appear with their bodies painted in various patterns. Occasionally an Apache is fortunate enough to have a supernatural experience with the Mountain Spirits of a particular mountain, to witness the performances of these masked supernaturals, and to be instructed in the songs, designs, and prayers which belong to the rite. After this Apache returns to the world outside, and to his own people, he masks and paints Apache men in imitation of the supernaturals he has seen, and sends them out to dance at times of widespread sickness or impending disaster. This procedure or rite is expected to establish rapport between the shaman and the original supernaturals from whom he gained his power, and to enlist the aid of the Mountain Spirits in the emergency which confronts the encampment. ////Formerly, as this text and others which follow indicate, the real Mountain Spirits sometimes came out upon this world in person to punish those who have profaned their rite or to succor Apache in need of their assistance. Now it is said that only those appear who are "made" or dressed in imitation of the true Mountain Spirits. These Apache masked dancers, however, are called gáͅhé , just as are the masked supernaturals of the mountains. [See also Ethnological note to Chircahua text 40, note 1 and following.] Ethnological Note 2 Formerly, the masked dancers were not "made" within the encampment, but had to be painted in an enclosure constructed in the mountains. From there they would march down the slope in single file, sometimes carrying firebrands. Ethnological Note 3 This rule has been greatly relaxed, but is still somewhat in force. Informants claim that it used to be strictly maintained. Ethnological Note 4 The people are advised, at the entrance of the masked dancers, to lower their eyes and pray. Ethnological Note 5 To "bless the fire" [The original phrasing "they worshipped the fire" has been changed to "they blessed the fire". Neither is a close match for the full meaning of the Apache phrase in context; but the change is made to answer the objections of many Apache people to the primitivistic, and inaccurate, connotations of the former--MEC] the masked dancers approach it in single file from the east, swaying their arms and bodies, and emitting, when near the flames, a cry peculiar to them. Then they shuffle backwards without turning, circle the fire clockwise, stop at the south and repeat the worship from the south side. This is done from each dir- ection, continuing in the sunwise ceremonial circuit. The "worship" described is the standard method by which the masked dancers purify any place, object, or person, and drive away disease and evil. A sick person who is being ceremonially treated by the masked dancers is approached from the four directions in the same manner. Ethnological Note 6 The prohibition against calling out the name of a masked dancer whom one recognizes is still observed. Ethnological Note 7 A shaman, since he is in direct communication with the source of his supernatural power, is often said to be aware of whatever anyone is saying or thinking about his power or his rite. Ethnological Note 8 The shaman probably sang the songs of the rite in order to learn the fate of the child. His attempts at intercession on her behalf, to judge by analogous tales that have been gathered, were probably extempore prayers. Ethnological Note 9 A periphrastic reference to the shaman's power or spirit guide. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note This motif of protection by being hidden beneath a fire occurs in other connections. It will be remembered that Child of the Water was preserved from the Menace by this means. [See Chiricahua text 1] Ethnological Note Ethnological Note That is, they tried in vain to feel at ease and enjoy the ceremony. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note These are the true supernaturals of the mountain. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note The Gray One, when the masked dance is held as a spectacular part of a feast or celebration [as occurs in connection with the Girl's Puberty Rite] acts the part of a clown. Then he awkwardly imitates his fellow-dancers and performs for the amusement of the on-lookers. In the myths, and when serious work such as curing is at hand, however, his role is entirely changed. He becomes a most important source of supernatural power, and by many, as by the narrator of this story, is considered the most potent masked dancer of the rite. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note The masked dancers are associated with directional-color symbolism. Ordinarily four masked dancers and the clown are "made" by one man. The leader, the one who heads the single file of dancers, is called the Black Mountain Spirit of the east. Next comes the Blue Mountain Spirit of the south, the Yellow Mountain Spirit of the west, and last the White Mountain Spirit of the north. Occasionally, as in this story, the clown or Gray One is substituted for the White Mountain Spirit and then takes his place as representative of the north. The association of colors and directions noted above is the one most commonly encountered in Chiricahua ritual. Due to the extremely individual character of religious experiences, however, variations are possible and do occur.
