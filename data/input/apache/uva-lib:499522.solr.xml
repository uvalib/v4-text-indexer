(7.1) n Dii'ágoch'íͅlaadáͅ, dá'íłtsé dágodeeyádáͅ, dáma'ye. n Dék'eh yádaałtiná'a. When the earth had been made, at the very beginning of time, there were just animals. They spoke like human beings. Coyote did wrong. (7.2) Ma'yeí doo'ee'áíͅlaadaná'a. n Diiíbikáee díík'eehnyá doo'ee'áíͅlaadaná'a. Coyote did wrong. He did wrong everywhere on the surface of the earth.

"Dá'íłtsé nahdáńyáń 'it'édeheetsaaye baadaałteeł." n díná'a. He had sexual desires toward his daughter. "When worms have fallen, you will go." he said. He said this because he had sexual desires toward his daughter. "You will give the oldest girl to the first person that you meet." he said. Then, the worms having fallen, they started out. (7.4) 'Ákoo, ch'osh noͅóͅtłizhgo, ts'ideeskaná'a. n Dásá ch'akaná'a. 'Áń bizáͅáͅyéń t'áͅyá nádeesgalná'a. "Shidádé dashnt'i." n diná'a. Then, the worms having fallen, they started out. They were going along some distance off. The smallest [child] looked back. "My father has jumped down." he said. "My father has jumped down." he said. "My little one, do not speak so. We have long ago left him." (7.5) "Shizáͅáͅyé, doo'ághách'i n dida. 'Iłk'idáͅ goch'áͅdeͅeͅka." "My little one, do not speak so. We have long ago left him." But his father had jumped down.

Then they were going along over yonder. "What did he say to you?" (7.7) "'Iyáa nałch'i n di." n diná'a. "What did he say to you?" said [Coyote]. "'Give the oldest girl to the very first person that you meet,' he said to us." (7.8) "'Dáhaań 'íłtsé nahdáńyáń 'it'édeheetsaaye baadaałteeł', nałch'i n di." "'Give the oldest girl to the very first person that you meet,' he said to us." Then he married his oldest daughter. (7.9) 'Ákoo goyách'e'ntsaań yaanádzá. Doo'ákaanaach'ighádaná'a. Then he married his oldest daughter. He did not go away. Then she was searching for lice on him. (7.10) 'Ákoo yaa káhách'intaaná'a. Góńtł'ashíͅ soͅoͅs si'áͅná'a. 'Ákoo 'áń biłnaach'i'aashń yaa káíkántaaná'a, bíńtł'ashíͅ soͅoͅs si'ání. Then she was searching for lice on him. A wart lay on the side of his head. Then his wife was searching for lice on the side of his head on which the wart lay. "They are again running to this side." (7.11) "Koshégo náách'at'i." díí ya n diiłná'a. "They are again running to this side." He kept on saying this. Then that girl went back to her mother. (7.12) 'Ákoo 'áń ch'eekéͅń bimáń yaanách'íńt'iná'a.

And she spoke thus to her mother. "When I am searching for lice on him [and] I will move my hand about the side of his head on which a wart lies, he is always saying, 'They are running to this side again.'" Then her mother spoke thus to her. (7.13) 'Ákoo gomáń 'ágooł n díná'a: "Yaa báháńdóͅóͅtaał. Nzhónóo biyiͅiͅłháásh. Ntaań bíńtł'ashíͅ soͅoͅs si'áͅn." Then her mother spoke thus to her. "You will search for lice on him. Put him to sleep quietly. A wart was on the side of your father's head." Then she put him to sleep. (7.14) 'Ákoo bits'iyiͅiͅłhaajná'a.

And she saw that wart on him while he was sleeping. Then she pushed his head away. "It is indeed him! It is indeed him! My mother, it is indeed him! It is indeed him!" She picked up a small axe.
