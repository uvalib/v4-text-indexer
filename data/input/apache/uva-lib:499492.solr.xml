Prayer When Building the Ceremonial Tipi as told by David Fatty When the earth had been created, (41.1) n Dii 'ágojílaadáͅ, Jo'oł díͅíͅ' t'aͅaͅnábáͅáͅzé. Jo'ołí díͅíͅ'gosíͅ shá'iłeeshndzigo, 'Ákooná 'áánshá. T'aͅaͅnábáázé díͅíͅgo 'iłeeshndzigoná, 'Áánshá. When the earth had been created, There were four fir trees [and] aspens. 1 When fir trees of the four directions have been put together for me, Only then shall I go there. Only when the four aspens have been put together, Shall I go there. 2 The White Painted Woman, on the earth today, her mind has been created. (41.2) 'Isdzánádleeshé n diibikázhiͅ dííjíͅ, bí n dii gooslíͅ. Bizaa gooslíͅ. Bits'ís goslíͅ. Bigále gooslíͅ. The White Painted Woman, on the earth today, her mind has been created. Her words have been created. Her body has been created. Her strength has been created. 3 [Of] the four that will move together, (41.3) Díͅíͅgo łe'naahi n dáí, Ha'óó'ání bich'iͅiͅshíͅ nkeen'áí, biyaa, gózhóͅ. n Diibiká n dé díík'eh beebiyaagózhóͅ. Nandi'áí biyaashíͅ nkeen'áí, biyaa, gózhóͅ. n Diibiká n dé gobá'ájił'iͅiͅ. 'I'óó'ání biyaashíͅ nkeen'áí, biyaa, gózhóͅ. n Dé gobá'ájił'iͅiͅ. Náhakosí bich'iͅiͅshíͅ nkeen'áí, biyaa, gózhóͅ. n Diibiká n dé gobá'ájił'iͅiͅ. [Of] the four that will move together, That which lies extended toward the east, under it, there is good. All the people on the earth share in the good under it. That which lies extended to the south, under it, there is good. They customarily make it so for the people on the earth. That which lies extended to the west, under it, there is good. They customarily make it so for the people. That which lies extended toward the north, under it, there is good. They customarily make it so for the people on the earth. 4 From the east, a road leads here. (41.4) Ha'óó'áͅshíͅ, koyá 'á'ítin. Sáͅgish tsiiba' dzaͅaͅee beekooghaͅ. 'Áídá'tinee, jígonaa'áí bitł'óle díͅíͅgoyá beech'é'ítin. Ts'is'ahnaagháí ! Bik'ehgózhóní. From the east, a road leads here. Here the tipi is made of old age staffs [and] gray hair. 5 Right at the door, roads made of the rays of the sun go out to the four directions. Long life! Its power is good. The White Painted Woman, on the earth, her mind has been created. (41.5) 'Isdzánádleeshéń n diibikázhiͅ, bí n dii gooslíͅ. Díídíí yeehanáyołí, Díí bits'ísí, Díí bigáleí. Dánahík'eh 'áí beenahigále.

The White Painted Woman, on the earth, her mind has been created. This is that by means of which she breathes, This is her body, This is her strength. The strength of all of us is made of that. 6 Do not say that it is good for only one day! 7 On this earth which has become old, In the sky which has become old, Only in this place does power remain. We want it for all of those who are children. 8 White Painted Woman, do not push us toward all of that which is evil on the earth! (41.6) 'Isdzánádleeshé, díí'ághánéńłt'éí n diibikáee yáadantóͅóͅyé'át'éí doobich'iͅiͅnaheenághiłda ! 'Isdzánádleeshé, dánahík'eh nch'áͅshíͅ n n dédlíͅ.

White Painted Woman, do not push us toward all of that which is evil on the earth! 9 White Painted Woman, all of us were created from you. Ethnological Note Because this is so, you have brought to us the earth pollen which lies in the space between the earth and the sky. There is nothing wrong with it. We are still living in it. Ethnological Note Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (41.1) Linguistic Notes 1. t'aͅaͅnábáͅáͅzé 'aspens'. t'aͅaͅ - 'leaf'; nábáͅáͅz 'it is round, it is full [as of the moon]'. ná - 'around, in a circle' [?]; - báͅáͅz 'to be round' [imp. neut. intr.]. 2. shá'iłeeshndzigo, 'when they have been put together for me'. shá - 'for me' plus the perf. of 'ił -ee-j-di-...[ni- perf.]-d-zii 'to be put together [as are the poles of a tipi at its apex] ' [pass.]. 'ił ieei 'by means of one another'; ji- di-. 3. 'áánshá 'I shall go there'. 'áá - 'there' plus the 1st person imp. of ni- ...[ni- perf.]- yá 'one person moves completively' [act. intr.]. (41.3) Linguistic Notes ha'óó'ání bich'iͅiͅshíͅ nkeen'áí 'that which lies extended toward the east'. ha'óó'ání 'east'; bich'iͅiͅshíͅ 'from toward it'; i nkeen'á 'a rigid object lies extended' [ni- perf. neut. intr. with the prefix nkee- ?]. (41.4) Linguistic Notes 1. koyá 'á'ítin 'a road leads here'. koyá 'here'; 'á 'here'; 'á'ítin 'road', cf. 'áńítin . 2. sáͅgish 'old age staffs'. sáͅ 'old age'; gish 'stick, cane'. 3. tsiiba' 'gray hair'. tsii- 'head', -ba' 'gray', cf. łi -ni-...- bá 'to be gray' [imp. neut intr.]. 4. beekooghaͅ 'the tipi is made of'. bee- 'by means of it'; kooghaͅ 'tipi, dwelling'. This construction occurs quite commonly in the songs and prayers. (41.5) Linguistic Notes [a typo in the original labels this section '41.15'-- MEC.] 1. n diií dánheest'óí 'ázhiͅ 'on the earth which has become old'. n diií 'earth'; 'ázhiͅ 'to there, on there'. dá - 'just' plus the perf. of ni-hi-... [si- perf.]-t'oo 'to wear out, to become old' [act. intr.]. 2. ná'godzii 'it remains, survives, is left over' [no analysis]. Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 Here the entire earth is likened to the main poles which constitute the framework of the ceremonial tipi. For the girl at the time of the ceremony, the ceremonial tipi is to be the whole world, cleansed and purified. Ethnological Note 2 These lines, though said by the shaman, imply that the girl is speaking. She is to go to the ceremonial tipi referred to. Ethnological Note 3 These lines refer to the girl in terms of the White Painted Woman. The adolescent girl is at the time of the ceremony called White Painted Woman. She is being re-created by the performance of the ceremony. Similarly, in paragraph 1, may be explained the reference to creation. Ethnological Note 4 That is, everything under the tipi poles, each of which is referred to a cardinal direction, is sanctified. Ethnological Note 5 The substances of which the tipi is to be constructed--old age staffs and gray hair--refer to the purpose of the ceremony, to give Long life to the girl. Ethnological Note 6 That is, the strength of a woman and her ability to carry on tasks of womanhood is directly attributable to this ceremony. Ethnological Note 7 That is, let the benefits of the ceremony continue throughout a long and fruitful life. Ethnological Note 8 These sentences neatly mirror the Apache conception of changeless supernatural power and the desirability of manipulating it for personal benefits. Ethnological Note 9 Here the term White Painted Woman is used to designate the mother of the culture hero and not the girl. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note That is, girls who go through this ceremony bear children as White Painted Woman did the culture hero, thus perpetuating the group. Ethnological Note Ethnological Note By conceiving the ceremony to take place in the midst of pollen, the holiest surroundings are given it.</field>
