(2.1) Tóbájiishchinéń `it'ago nłdzil hilaadadáͅ, Naaghéé'neesghánéń `ánáá n déná'a. `Inázhaná'a Biͅiͅ naiłtseená'a. Dásígózhóͅgo biͅiͅ yiyałhééłgo, Ghééyeń baahagááłná'a. Baahayałtééłná'a. Dooyáadago, Naaghéé'neesghánéń nnáhadááłná'a. Ghéé'yeń bigee chaałnaajigháná'a. When Child of the Water was still growing up, Killer of Enemies was already a man. He often hunted. He killed [many] deer. But just as he was killing the deer, the Giant would come to him. He would take it away from him. [Having] nothing, Killer of Enemies would [then] come back home. He went about weeping because of the Giant. And now Child of the Water had become stronger. (2.2) `Ákoo k'adi Tóbájiishchinéń dáha'yá nłdzil silíͅná'a. Bimáń `Isdzánádleeshéń `áyiił n díná'a: "Shimá, k'aa shá'ágolá. Shik'iséͅ biłdéshzhaa." bimáń yiił n díná'a. And now Child of the Water had become stronger. He spoke thus to his mother, White Painted Woman: "My mother, make arrows for me. I'll go hunting with my brother." he said to his mother. Then White Painted Woman spoke thus to her son: (2.3) Nágo Isdzánádleeshéń bizhaań `áyiił n díná'a: "Shishke'é, doodaagoodzaadago `áń n dí. `Áń Ghéé'ye hooghéń niiłhe. `Áń naagołtsee." gooł n díná'a. Then White Painted Woman spoke thus to her son: "My child, what you say cannot be done. That one who is called Giant will kill you. That one kills [everyone]." she said to him. In spite of this, Child of the Water spoke thus to his mother: (2.4) Dá'ághát'éndah, Tóbájiishchinéń bimáń `áyiił n díná'a: "'Áhaͅh ! Dá'ághát'éndah shik'isń biłdéshzhaa." n díná'a. "'Íͅyaͅaͅ, haͅh ! k'aa shá'ágolá." bimáń yiił n díná'a. In spite of this, Child of the Water spoke thus to his mother: "Hurry! In spite of that, I shall go hunting with my brother." he said "So hurry! Make arrows for me." he said to his mother. Then, because he spoke in this way, his mother, because of that, wept. (2.5) `Ákoo, `ágháji n dííbaͅaͅ, gomáń 'áí higee hichaná'a. Then, because he spoke in this way, his mother, because of that, wept. Then, [though] his mother did not want him [to go] and was very much afraid on his account, he started off to hunt with Killer of Enemies. (2.6) Nágo, gomáń dádookáhát'íͅdago dákábiłgóghégo, Naaghéé'neesghánéńbił jideezhaaná'a. Then, [though] his mother did not want him [to go] and was very much afraid on his account, he started off to hunt with Killer of Enemies. The two went out yonder. (2.7) Koyá ch'éjíń'áázhná'a. n Dáséyá, jazha. Biͅiͅ jiyeesxíͅná'a. Ní'jił`ahná'a. Ní'jiis'ahná'a. Koͅoͅ de'shdóółjéná'a. `Itsiͅiͅ tsízhóó'áͅná'a. `Itsiͅiͅ jiist'éná'a.

At a place further on, they were hunting They killed a deer They [began] to butcher it. They [finished] butchering it. They had built a fire. They had put meat on the fire.

On it, they had put the meat He and Killer of Enemies had sat down to it Just as they had started to eat it, the Giant came up to them.

Then Killer of Enemies, as soon as he saw the Giant, burst out crying. Weeping, he sat [there]. Then Child of the Water spoke thus to Killer of Enemies: (2.9) `Ákoo Tóbájiishchinéń Naaghee'neesghánéń `áyiił n díná'a: "Shik'iséͅ, `iyáabaͅaͅ ncha? Bíni', doonchaada." yił n díná'a. Then Child of the Water spoke thus to Killer of Enemies: "My brother, why [do] you weep? Stop, do not cry." he said to him. Then Killer of Enemies spoke thus to Child of the Water: (2.10) `Ákoo Naaghéé'neesghánéń Tóbájiishchinéń `áyiił n díná'a. "Shik'iséͅ, `áń n dé doonzhóͅdań nahch'iͅiͅhogááłń higee hishcha." gooł n díná'a. Then Killer of Enemies spoke thus to Child of the Water: "My brother, I cry because of that evil person who is coming to us." he said. Then, as the two who had sat down to it began to eat the meat, he took it away from them. (2.11) Nágo, `itsiͅiͅ be'jinyáͅgo bich'iͅiͅzhineeskéní, kaanáyin'áͅná'a.

[Child of the Water] took it away from him. [Giant] took it away from him. [Child of the Water] took it away from him. [Giant] took it away from him. In just this manner, they passed it between themselves exactly four times Then the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: (2.14) Nágo Ghéé'yeń Tóbájiishchinéń `áyiił n díná'a: "Haadí nk'a'go, hashínké?" gooł n díná'a. Then the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: "Where are your arrows, you [who] are fierce?" he said to him. Then Child of the Water picked up his arrows. (2.15) `Ákoo Tóbájiishchinéń bik'aa'í náyinjaaná'a. "'Ádíídíí'a -- díídíí shik'a'." gooł n díná'a. Then Child of the Water picked up his arrows. 2 "These -- these [are] my arrows." he said to him. Then the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: (2.16) `Ákoo Ghéé'heń Tóbájiishchinéń `áyiił n díná'a: "Hanshaͅ, `ńjááshaͅaͅ nák'édishxaał." gooł n díná'a.

Nágo Ghéé'yeń k'aaní bitsile káyéishjaaná'a. Gháhá dádoodees'íͅdayá káyaanáyíń n dilná'a. Then he gave them to him. Then the Giant rubbed the arrows on his anus. He threw them away without looking to see where [they went]. Then Child of the Water spoke similarly to the Giant: (2.18) Nágo `iłdóͅ Tóbájiishchinéń Ghéé'yeń `áyiił n díná'a: " n Dí'a ! Haadí nik'a'?" gooł n díná'a. Then Child of the Water spoke similarly to the Giant: "You! Where are your arrows?" he said to him. The Giant pointed out some big pine logs which were lying at his side. (2.19) Béńch'iyéntsaazi biyeeshxahyá sizhoozhí Ghéé'yeń káyółchiná'a. "Díídíí'a -- díí shik'a' `át'é." Tóbájiishchinéń yiił n díná'a. The Giant pointed out some big pine logs which were lying at his side. "These -- these are my arrows." he said to Child of the Water. Then Child of the Water arose. (2.20) `Ákoo Tóbájiishchinéń nádiidzáná'a. Béńch'iyéí shik'a' biłji n díní káik'inaaheesjiͅiͅná'a. Then Child of the Water arose. He rubbed his anus on the pine logs [Giant] had told him [were] his arrows. Then Child of the Water and the Giant quarrelled with each other. (2.21) Nágo Tóbájiishchinéń Ghéé'yeńbił `iłaanaagot'aashná'a. Naaghéé'neesghánéń `iłk'idáͅ ndé silíͅ ndah, biłgóghégo hichago, goch'iͅiͅsidáná'a. Then Child of the Water and the Giant quarrelled with each other. Killer of Enemies had long ago become a man but, afraid and crying, he sat next to [Child of the Water]. Then, finally, the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: (2.22) `Áko, k'adi, Ghéé'yeń Tóbájiishchinéń `áyii n díná'a: "'Áhaͅh, k'adi, `iłnnłt'ó. T'éhéńdiidaí bégooziͅiͅ." Tóbájiishchinéń yiił n díná'a. Then, finally, the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: "Well, then, let's shoot at each other. [That] will show if you are so brave." he said to Child of the Water. "All right." (2.23) "'Áhaͅh." Tóbájiishchinéń gooł n díná'a. "All right." said Child of the Water to him. Then the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: (2.24) Nágo Ghéé'yeń Tóbájiishchinéń `áyiił n díná'a: " n Dí `iłtsé -- shánanń n dá. Shí `iłtsé ninsht'ó." gooł n díná'a. Then the Giant spoke thus to Child of the Water: "You first -- stand [over there] for me. I'll shoot at you first." he said to him.

Child of the Water shot at him. The topmost [layer of] his flint coat slid off him. The next layer, as he shot at him again, this one, slid off him also. He shot at him again for the third time. The third time, his coat again slid off him. Then his heart [could] clearly [be seen] beating. [Child of the Water] shot at him again for the fourth time. He shot [the arrow] right into the center of his heart. Then the Giant spoke thus: (2.30) Nágo Ghéé'yeń `á n díná'a. "'Iyáahee doot'íͅdaí `áshił`iͅiͅná?" n díná'a. Then the Giant spoke thus: "What has that which cannot be seen done to me?" he said. Then Child of the Water spoke thus to Killer of Enemies: (2.31) Nágo Tóbájishchinéń Naaghéé'neesghánéń `áyiił n díná'a: "Nánłghee ! Ndééskaa ! K'adi, nk'eeniikaa !" gooł n díná'a.

They had come back to her. They had brought [a deer] for her. So she was happy. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (2.1) Linguistic Notes 1. 'it'ago nłdzil hilaadadáͅ 'when he was still growing up'. 'it'ago 'still' [part.], -go subordinating enclitic. nłdzil , third person of ni-...- ł - dzil 'to be strong' [imp. neut. intr.; ni- adj.]. hilaa, third person imperfective of -laa 'to become' [act. intr.; hi- peg element, see Grammatical Sketch, §13]. -da 'even, just as' [encl.]; -d áͅ 'at such a time, when' [encl.]. Literally 'when he was just becoming stronger. 2. 'ánáá n déná'a 'he was already a man'. Third person of 'á - náá - ni -...- n dé 'to be already a man' [imp. neut. intr.]. Cf. ni-...- n dé - 'to be a man, to be mature, virile' [imp. neut. intr.] and n dé 'man'. 'á - náá - 'already' (?); ni- adj. 3. 'inázhaná'a 'he often hunted, it is said'. Third person iterative of ' i-| [hi- perf.]- zhá 'to go off hunting' [act. intr.]. 'i-| 'away, off'. 4. biͅiͅ 'deer'. 5. naiłtseená'a 'he killed then, it is said'. Third person imperfective of naa-|...[si- perf.]- ł -tsee 'to kill several' [act. tr. with plural object only]. nai- &gt; naa-| 'about' plus yi- third person object. 6. dásígózhóͅgo 'just as'. dásí - 'just, exactly' [part.]. gózhóͅgo, see note 1.13, §3. 7. yiyałhééłgo 'he, killing it'. 3rd person prog. of si-...[si perf.]- ł -gh é 'to kill one' [act. tr.]. The prefix si- referring to killing becomes yi- when preceded by a pronoun object or the deictic elements. Thus yi- 3rd person obj. plus si- plus ha- 3rd person prog. plus - ł - classifier becomes yiyał -. The initial consonant of the stem assimilates in voice to the preceding - ł -. In this passage, the number of the noun is determined by the verb. b iͅiͅ 'deer', in the preceding sentence, is plural because its verb requires a plural object. In this sentence, it is singular because its verb requires a singular object. 8. baahagááłná'a 'he was coming to him; it is said'. baa- &gt; bi- third person object plus aa- 'to' [pp.]. Ordinarily yi- rather than bi- should be used here since the subject is also third person [see Grammatical Sketch, §11]. hagááł , third person progressive of -y á 'one moves' [act. intr.] . For the stem, see note 1.15, §2. By employing the progressive mode in this line and the two following, the informant conveys the impression that this happening was a customary one with Killer of Enemies. 9. baahayałtééłná'a 'he was taking it away from him, it is said'. baa- &gt; bi- third person object plus aa- 'from' [pp.]. Here, again, bi- is used instead of yi [see §8 above]. Note also the variety of meanings associated with the postposition aͅaͅ - : 'to' in §8, 'from' in this example. See also notes 1.15, §8; 1.8, §5; and 1.19, §3. hayałtééł third person progressive of haa- | [hi- perf.]-tee 'to take an animate object away' [act. tr.; haa- | 'away, out'). 10. dooyáadago '[having] nothing'. yáa 'something'; doo-...da negative. 11. nnáhadááłná'a 'he was coming back home, it is said. Third person prog. of ni - ná - ni... [ si - perf. ]- dá 'one returns [home]' [act. intr]. ni- 'to an end, to a stop'; n á - 'back' [requires the -d- form]; ni- completive [occurs only in the imp. mode]. For the stem. see note 1.15, §2. 12. bigee 'because of him'. -gee 'because of' [pp.], bi- third person pronoun. (2.2) Linguistic Notes 1. dáha'yá nłdzil silíͅná'a 'he had become stronger, it is said'. dáha'yá 'somewhat; ha'- indefinite pronoun stem plus d á - 'just' and - yá postposition. nłdzil 'he is strong', see note 2.1, §1. sil íͅ , third person si- perf. of -laa 'to become' [act. intr.]. 2. bimáń 'his mother'. - má 'mother'. 3. 'áyiił n díná'a 'he spoke thus to her, it is said'. See note 1.15, 2. 4. k'aa shá'ágolá 'make arrows for me' should read k'aa shá'ágólá. k'aa 'arrows'; sh á - &gt; shi- first person object plus áá - 'for' [pp.]. 'á... [? perf.]-l á 'to make' [act. tr.] 'á - 'thus']. go 3a object refers to arrows. The text form is second person imperfective. 5. shik'iséͅ 'my brother'. -k'is 'sibling of same sex'; - éͅ ?. 6. biłdéshzhaa 'I've started to go hunting with him'. bi- 'him'; - ł - 'with, accompanying' [pp.]; déshzhaa , first person perf. of di-...[si- perf.] -d zhá 'to hunt [act. intr.; di- inceptive]. di- plus s í - gives dé -. This verb is sometimes conjugated in the perfective as a -d- verb and at other times as a zero verb. (2.3) Linguistic Notes 1. doodaagoodzaadago 'it being impossible'. doo-...-da negative. daagoodzaa, third person perf. of daa-go-...[? perf]-- n d á something happens, is done' [act. intr.]. daa-go- is indefinable. 2. 'áń n dí 'you say thus'. Second person imp. of 'á - di -. .. [ hi - perf.]- ndí 'to say thus' [act. intr.]. 'á 'thus, so'; di- noise. In the second person imp., di- becomes n-. Literally, this line reads 'My child, it being impossible you say thus'. 3. niiłhe 'he will kill you'. niił - &gt; ni- 2nd person object plus si- prefix and - ł - classifier. Stem - ghé [- hé by assimilation to the preceding - ł -] 'to kill one' [act. tr.]. See note 2.1, §7 4. naagołtsee 'he kills them'. 3rd person imp. with 3a object of n áá - |...[si- perf.]- ł -tsee 'to kill several' [act. tr.]. See note 2.1, §5.

Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 The arrows of Child of the Water are often described as made of grama-grass. Ethnological Note 2 One version has it that Child of the Water swallows a bead of turquoise each time Giant shoots, and the arrows of the Giant are splintered in mid-air. Others say that Child of the Water recited certain prayers which caused the arrows to miss their mark. Still others say that Child of the Water, aided by lightning, blew outward each time and shattered the arrows. [See Mescalero text 8]. Ethnological Note 3 Very often informants name some locality where the bones of the Giant, now turned to rock can be seen to this day. Lava beds and masses of dark or reddish rock are pointed out as the coagulated blood of the Giant. The Giant is said to have been so tall that his outstretched body covered four mountain ridges.</field>
