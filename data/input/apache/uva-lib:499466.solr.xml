(15.1) 'Áshíͅ n dásá ch'énáánááłghoná'a. n Dáséee Gólizhnłchiné yaatł'aa'ił'ágo yaahíłghoná'a, dásí'íńtinyá. Then he again went on. At a place further on, he came to a Beetle standing on his head right in the middle of the road. Then Coyote spoke thus: (15.2) Nágo Ma'yeí 'á n diná'a: "'Ik'ah hisháͅnágo naashá." yiił n diná'a. "Haͅh nishghał." yiił n digo hich'iͅiͅsizíͅná'a. Then Coyote spoke thus: "I eat only fat in order to live." he said to him. "I'm going to eat you right away." he said to him as he stood next to him. Then the Beetle spoke thus to him: (15.3) Nágo Gólizhnchinéí 'abiił n diná'a: "'Iłtséda, haastiͅiͅ, doodaan n dida ! Koyá n diiítł'áhyá 'iyáahee daaji n dií 'iyéshts'áͅ." Then the Beetle spoke thus to him: "Wait, old man, don't say anything! I am listening to what some [people] are saying [down] there under the ground." Then Coyote spoke thus to him: (15.4) Nágo Ma'yeí 'ábiił n diná'a: "Haͅh ! 'Iyáadaaji n dií shiłgół n diigo ! 'Áńdeeda nishghał." biił n diná'a. Then Coyote spoke thus to him: "Hurry! Tell me what they are saying! When you have told me, then I'll eat you." he said to him. Then the Beetle spoke thus to him: (15.5) Nágo Gólizhnchinéí 'ábiił n diná'a: "'Aashíͅ háné tsé hik'eeschaͅaͅnń dákogo hádaashdighaał. Daajiiłhé daaji n di hiłch'a'." Then the Beetle spoke thus to him: "Right now they are going to look for someone who has defecated on a rock over there. It sounds [as if] they are saying [that] they are going to kill him." Then Coyote spoke thus to him: (15.6) Nágo Ma'yeí 'ábiił n diná'a: "Haͅaͅshaͅ, 'íłtsé. Dá'iͅiͅshíͅ shiba'síndá ! 'Ághaee 'iyáa'ist'enní'iͅiͅí baanánshdá."

Just as he had been coming there, he had defecated on a rock. That is what he was speaking to him [about]. At the place to which he returned, he licked it off. (15.7) T'áͅyá yaanáłghoyá, náyóół n dáná'a. "Shiba'síndá" gooł n diínee náłghoná'a. Dooha'yáadaná'a. Baaha'zhałghoná'a. At the place to which he returned, he licked it off. He returned to the place where he had said "Wait for me." No one was there. [Beetle] had run away from him. Then he cursed himself. (15.8) Nágo 'ádódziiná'a: "Mai bishke' ! 'Iłk'idáͅ 'iłghałnee baa'isdánóodzá !" n diná'a. Then he cursed himself. "Child of a Coyote! He has long ago left the place where he should have been eaten!" he said. Linguistic Notes by Harry Hoijer (15.1) Linguistic Notes 1. Gólizhnłchiné 'beetle, tip-beetle'. Apparently a compound of gólizh -; the 3rd person of ni- ...- ł - chiͅ , 'to smell, give off an odor' [imp. neut. intr.; ni- adj.]; and the archaic , relative - é . gólizh - also appears in the word gólizhé 'skunk'. The gó - of these forms may be cognate with the gó - [or góó' -] of the following: góó'zhiné 'black ants' [-zhin- bound form of łi -ni-...- zhiͅ , 'to be black']; góó'łchídé 'red ants' [- łchíd - bound form of łi -ni...- chí 'to be red']; góna'a'é 'a species of animal' [- na'a'é ?]; góó'ye 'animal'; góó'is'iͅ' 'mink' [- 'is'iͅ' ?]; gó 'snake'. -lizh may be related to the theme - líísh 'to urinate' [perf. -lizh]. 2. yaatł'aa'ił'ágo 'standing on his head' should read yaatł'aa'iił'ágo . 3rd person of yaatł'aa -'i- |...- ł - 'á 'to stand on one's head' [imp. neut. intr.]. No further analysis is possible. (15.2) Linguistic Notes 'ik'ah hisháͅnágo naashá 'I eat only fat in order to.live'. This is a phrase Coyote utters when he meets those he is about to devour. - k'ah 'fat, fatty meat'; hisháͅ , 1st person imp. of ...[hi- perf.]- yáͅ 'to eat' [act. tr.]; naashá 'I go about, I live'. (15.3) Linguistic Notes 1. haastiͅiͅ 'old man'. A verbal abstract, the 3rd person of ha-...-d- tiͅ . 'to be old' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. 2. doodaan n dida 'don't say anything'. 2nd person imp. of daa-di...[hi- perf.]- n dí [or - n di] 'to say something' [act. intr.]. di- is a prefix referring to noise; daa- 'something' [?]. (15.5) Linguistic Notes The last sentence of this passage means literally: daajiiłhé 'they will kill him'; daaji n di 'they are saying'; hiłch'a' 'there is a noise'. (15.6) Linguistic Notes 1. shiba'síndá 'wait for me'. shiba' 'for me' plus the 2nd person of - dá 'one sits' [si- perf. neut. intr.]. 2. 'iyáa'ist'enní'iͅiͅí 'something which I left there'. 'iyáa 'something' and 'ist'e- 'there' [?] plus the 1st person perf. of ni-ni...[ni- perf.]- 'iͅiͅ 'to put down an unknown object' [act. tr.]. 3. 'áshóͅoͅłghołdáͅ 'as he had been coming there' . 'áshí 'from there' plus hołghoł 'he is coming' and - dáͅ 'at that time'. (15.8) Linguistic Notes 1. 'iłghałnee 'the place where he should have been eaten'. 3rd person cont. imp. with indef. obj. of ...[hi- perf.]-l- ghááł 'to eat meat-like substances' [act. tr.]. -n past tense; -ee 'at'. 2. baa'isdánóodzá 'he has left it'. baa- 'from it' plus 3rd person perf. of 'isdá - ná -...[hi- perf.]- dá 'one escapes' [act. intr.]. The theme - dá is the -d- form of - yá 'one moves'.</field>
