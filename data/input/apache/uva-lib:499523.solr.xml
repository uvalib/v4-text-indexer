When the earth had been made, At the very beginning, People were not permitted to live on the surface of the earth. A cloud moved down. (8.2) K'osí daheestoͅná'a. 'Isdzánádaleeshń yáda'neetíͅná'a. 'Ákoo Naaghéé'neesghánéń góͅlíͅná'a. A cloud moved down. White Painted Woman lay face upward for it. And then Killer of Enemies existed. Then she reared him under the fire. (8.3) 'Ákoo koͅoͅ'í bitł'áhyá ch'insáná'a. Ghíí'yí kaanádáná'a. Then she reared him under the fire. Giant often came to her. Then: (8.4) 'Ákoo: "'Éłchiné bichaane káási'iͅiͅ." gooł n díná'a, Ghíí'yí. Then: "Here is the excrement of a child," Giant said to her. "I long so for a child that I often make the excrement of a child." (8.5) "'Éłchiné béńdaastsaago 'éłchiné bichaͅaͅ 'ánágosh'iͅiͅ." "I long so for a child that I often make the excrement of a child." Giant knew that she was rearing a little one. (8.6) Ghíí'yí bizáͅáͅyéń ch'insáí yégóͅsiͅná'a. Giant knew that she was rearing a little one. Killer of Enemies became able to walk about. (8.7) Naaghéé'sghánéń naghá silíͅná'a. Ch'insáná'a. 'Ákoo ntsaa silíͅná'a. Killer of Enemies became able to walk about. She reared him. And he became bigger. Giant came to her again. (8.8) Ghíí'í kanáánádzáná'a. Koͅoͅbaͅaͅee bikék'ehná'a. Ghíí'í bikék'ehe kaagoͅoͅłtsáͅná'a. "'Éłchiné bikék'eh." n díná'a. Giant came to her again. [Killer of Enemies'] tracks were around the fire. Giant saw his tracks. "A child's tracks," he said. "I often make a child's tracks," (8.9) "'Éłchiné bikék'eh 'ánágosh'iͅiͅ." n díná'a, 'Isdzánádleeshń. "I often make a child's tracks," said White Painted Woman. He spoke thus: (8.10) 'Á n díná'a: "Haͅaͅshaͅ, 'ágháͅlá 'éłchiné bikék'ehí." He spoke thus: "Well then, make a child's tracks." Then she did it for him. (8.11) 'Ákoo bá'ághách'íͅlaaná'a. 'Ákoo, goganí n diibikáyá, 'éłchiné bikék'eh bá'ágoch'íͅlaaná'a, goganíbee. 'Ákoo 'éłchiné dáá n dí bikék'ehná'ahá. Then she did it for him. Then, her hand on the ground, she made a child's tracks for him with her hand. And they were indeed a child's tracks. Then Giant spoke thus: (8.12) 'Ákoo Ghíí'í 'á n díná'a: "Dáá n dí 'éłchiné bikék'eh 'ágonlaaí." 'Ákoo goch'áͅnáánóͅóͅdzáná'a, Ghíí'yí. Then Giant spoke thus: "It is true that you have made a child's tracks." Then Giant left her again. Then Killer of Enemies became older. (8.13) 'Ákoo Naghéé'neesghánéń ntsaa silíͅná'a. 'Ákoo k'aa bá'ágoch'íͅlaaná'a. K'aa dádíͅíͅ' bá'ágoch'íͅlaaná'a, Isdzánádleeshń. K'aa yeediłt'óná'a. Then Killer of Enemies became older. And she made arrows for him. White Painted Woman made exactly four arrows for him. He began to shoot with the arrows. Killer of Enemies spoke thus. (8.14) 'Á n díná'a, Naaghéé'neesghánéń: "Góͅghéí doo'ághán n déńgólaadaí bich'iͅiͅgodishlé." n díná'a. Killer of Enemies spoke thus.

" n Dígo 'íłtsé shíńłt'ó." biłch'i n díná'a. "No," he said to him. "You shoot at me first," he said to him. Then a pine tree was [Giant's] arrow. (8.24) 'Ákoo béńch'iyé bik'aaná'a.

"I'll dig four [tunnels] to him over there. You watch me. I'll dig four [tunnels] ...under one another. I'll pull fur from [the region of] his heart." Then [Gopher] pulled out [Buffalo's fur.

And then he also tore up the next one below it with his horns. Then he also began to tear up with his horns the one into which [Killer of Enemies] had run. Just as he reached him with his horns, he fell over. [Killer of Enemies] had killed him. He had done so because he did not permit people to live. Then he took out the Buffalo's intestines.

Then, as soon as [Eagle] saw him, he swooped down on him. He seized him. He flew up with him. He carried him back to the red mountain peak. He had carried him back to his children. Then: (8.51) 'Ákoo: "Haͅh daa'ałghał." n díná'a. 'Ákoogo 'oͅóͅt'aná'a. Then: "Eat him up quickly," he said. Then he flew away. Then [Killer of Enemies] stood up before the children.

Then he lay in wait for [Eagle] with the stone club. The water began to fall. From over yonder [Eagle] came flying. Then he alighted. [Killer of Enemies] sat under (his perch] with the stone club. He struck him with it. Then: (8.59) 'Ákoo: "Nmáń ha'go nnáhadááł?" biłch'i n díná'a. Then: "When does your mother return?" he said to him. "In the evening when the water falls."

As they got close, as he started to sink down to the ground with him, He struck [the Eagle] with the stone club. He blew on the feathers he was plucking out of him. "These are called 'birds'." They flew out all over, all these birds on the suface of the earth. (8.65) 'Ághahyá ts'éhat'aná'a, díí n diibikáee 'izhásheí.

Ordinarily this would be translated 'they say to them' [see linguistic note to Chiricahua text 1.15, §3]. Perhaps the phrase should be translated 'they [the monsters] tell people [that] they are dangerous.' (8.16) Linguistic Notes shídó nghégo 'ádish n dí 'I say that I am dangerous also'. Note that nghégo is the 3rd person [see note 8.15] rather than the 1st person the translation would seem to require. Perhaps a better translation would be 'I too say that they [the monsters] are dangerous.' (8.24) Linguistic Notes 1. yíńyolná'a 'he blew at it'. 3rd person, perf. with 3rd person object of ni-...[ni- perf.]- yooł 'to blow at' [act. tr.]. Cf. baanáách'íńyolná'a 'he blew at it again' [passage 26]. Here the 3a person perf. of the above verb is preceded by baa- 'to it, at it' and the prefix náá - 'again'. Finally, in passage 28, is found nááyíńyolná'a 'he blew at it again'. 2. naa'i n diiná'a 'it was shattered'. 3rd person imp. of naa-'i-...[si- perf.]- n dii 'several fly about' [act. intr.].

(8.34) Linguistic Notes shídó nghé 'I too am dangerous'. Here, again, the verb seems to have the wrong person for the translation given. See note 8.16.

(8.41) Linguistic Notes shaadaasdlí 'they are cold'. shaa- ? plus the 3rd person distrib. of -d- dlí 'to be cold' [si- perf. neut.]. Does shaa- mean 'because of me' and the whole phrase 'they are cold because of me' or, more freely, 'I have let them become cold'? (8.44) Linguistic Notes The second line is literally as follows: "His heart / right in the open / it moving / he had made it so for him, it is said / Gopher." dách'it'igo 'it moving'. dá - 'just' plus the 3rd person cont. imp. of ch'i-...[? perf.]- t'é 'to move' [?].

'ik'a 'fat, fatty meat'. łáné , - é relative of łáͅ 'much'. The connotation 'slice of fatty meat' is given by the following verb which refers to the handling of fabric-like objects.

I cannot analyze the second word. (8.85) Linguistic Notes The third line is literally as follows: "Very much / far / his tongue / it extending out / he went to him." deech'ago 'far' [no analysis]. Ethnological Notes Morris Opler Ethnological Note 1 This is a Mescalero version of the incidents related in Chiricahua Apache Texts 1-5. Contrary to the usual Mescalero custom, however, this informant makes Killer of Enemies the hero of the tale instead of Child of the Water. This may be explained by the fact that the informant is of part Lipan extraction and spends a great deal of his time with the old Lipan people. Furthermore, he is an ardent convert to a recently developed religious movement [the "Silas John Cult"] which originated on the San Carlos Reservation and therefore designates Killer of Enemies as the chief culture hero to whom songs and prayers are to be addressed. See Ethnological Notes to the Chiricahua Apache Text 1, note 3. Ethnological Note 2 This is somewhat ambiguous. It is clear, however, that the informant meant to indicate that Killer of Enemies also took blood from the body of the dead Buffalo. Ethnological Note 3 Literally: "he who kills with his eyes." Ethnological Note 4 That is, the ladder which led to the doorway of Owl's house. Ethnological Note 5 The sense of this interchange is somewhat obscure.</field>
