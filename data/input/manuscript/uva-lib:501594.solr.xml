      <field name="fulltext">Camp near New Market Va April 22nd, 1862 My precious Addie ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot apologize for not writing sooner for all I could plead would be a march and its attendant miseries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We left our camp near Edinburg the 17th inst, and arrived here the same night, but our baggage,did not come up until yesterday, and it has rained quite heavily since until this morning. If I did not know it is my duty and that it pleases her for whom I would die , I would not write to- day .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am not well dear Addie , nor have I been for a week. I caught a severe cold, and it has settled upon my lungs, and in my head, leaving me a troublesome cough and a severe headache, which last hangs on in spite of every effort to remove it. —I can hardly see the lines on the paper, so you must excuse the poor writing. But I am still trying to perform my duties in the company, and hope by the time I write again I shall be fully well. I wrote a "kind" of letter to you on the 11th inst , and sent it by a friend of mine to Woodstock to be mailed, but it escaped his memory, and he just gave it to me yesterday I enclose it in this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our advance to New Market was marked by nothing serious, but it was a march of caution, also a series of brilliant dashes. It would be useless for me to attempt to particularize now, for I am not in a proper state of mind. We saved the large covered bridge across the Shenandoah , but they tried hard to burn it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mt. Jackson is a small town and not a very neat one, certainly not one half as pretty as New Market . Our camp is near the latter place distant only about half a mile</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I went across the river a day or two since, and what do you think I found? Nothing more nor less than a genuine, and pretty Secessionist in the form of a young lady of about fifteen by name Miss Mary Rice .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course I immediately "set my cap" for her and when I thought my self on the verge of success imagine my chagrin as she turned around and with all the sarcastic and biting emphasis of which she is capable, said, "Do you know that I hate Yankees?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I replied "Do you know I do not , on the con- trary , there is one I regard in a much more amiable manner?" "Who is it, for the love of mercy?" was the answer. I immediately showed her the portrait of a certain hand- some Ohioan, ( I wouldn't tell you who it was,) and with a look of scorn she said, "She isn't pretty — she is a yankee." Said I — "she is pretty, and a more handsome young lady cannot be found in any or all of the Southern states."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"You look with partial eyes." said she. "Do you see with impartial ones?" was my response Finally she admitted that it was "pretty, but then she is a yankee." By this time, my "righteous indignation" began to rise, and I said almost petulantly, " Yes , she is a Yankee girl, and she is proud of it, and so am I . — More that that — she would die sooner than submit to have the glorious Stars and stripes trampled under foot by traitors without giving them their just reward a traitors doom ." and I will fight for her and her country, and rest assured, I'll not submit or return home, until your unholy flag be trailed in the dust. aye destroyed ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We conversed some time longer, during which I did not fail to instil into her mind, that patriotism, to ones country, consists in "obeying the constitution and enforcing the laws." and I flatter myself I left her a less violent secessionist than she was when I went there.— At any rate she condescended to give me my supper, while she would not some others who were there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would answer your kind letters in a more detailed and concise form, my darling but my head instead of ceasing to ache. " puts in harder ." As soon as I get better, I will write you a good long — and I hope more interesting than this — letter. I will also answer Laurie 's kind letter in a day or so, meanwhile give her my kind regards, also. Dora and all who inquire for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Believe me my darling that I am as ever, devotedly yours, in true, fervid, affection Charlie Direct the same as heretofore, and don't fail to write very often, your last I recieved the 16th inst . the last letter from you I am really getting alarmed.</field>
