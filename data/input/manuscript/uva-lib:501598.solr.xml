      <field name="fulltext">Camp in Maryland, 3 miles above Georgetown, Sept. 5th, 1862 My own darling Addie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last, I have a chance to write a few lines,with a hope that it will soon reach you. I wrote you a good long letter from Culpepper on the 18th of August, but as we left there that day, I supposed it has never been sent. On the 20th, an order was recieved from Gen. Halleck forbidding the further transmission of mails, and until now I have had no opportunity to send a line to apprise you of my safety. I know how you must suffer, and how thoughless you must think me, but all I can plead is the inexorable character of military orders. I have much to write you as soon as we can remain 24 hours in a place. Since the 18th, we have been constantly under arms and for more than 3/4 of the time under fire from the enemy, but we have not lost a man. I have kept a full journal of all our proceedings, which I shall send to the Chronicle for publication, as soon as I can.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Out of 18 days, we have march 11, and but two nights have we slept under a blanket, and those the last two nights. But scarce is a murmer of dissatisfaction have I heard, except at the almost manner in which we have been deprived of news from home. But is not the record of the last three weeks a dark one? While on the 11th of Aug. we had a Point-d'apprei on the Rapidan river, we have the Potomac for a base of operations- not to say of defense .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have lost in killed, surrounded, and prisoners not less than twenty thousand men. poorly has John Pope met the expectations of the nation. (No event has caused such general and genuine rejoicing in the army, as has the of Gen. McClellan to the command of the entire army of Virginia, I confess that my confidence in him is and and I believe all feel the same. Gen. Pope was too strong in written pronuniciamento (whew what a long word!) upon the start to hold out good in action. While he condcuted a small army in the west most admirably, against really inferior generals, he has proven himself incompetent to handle a large force, against a wily and subtle Jackson or an accomplished Lee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I guess this will not be very interesting to you, so I will change the subject. (while we have been performing arduous marches and course temmarches, through rain, mud, sunshine and dust. "I have" and with less that 1/3 rations of Bread and coffee, I have not forgotten that it was for my country and thee for whom I was fighting, and though we passed unscathed through the sotrm of balls and skulls, I have remembered that it was in answer to your prayers that the bullets past me harmlessly, and the horrid shell burst in rain. I have enjoyed perfect health during the entire time, not even contracting a cold, not withstanding the exposure we have endured. Had I been allowed to write to you, and to recieve letters from you. I should have been happy, but instead my mind has been filled with vague fears for your health and happiness, and I am as anxious as ever. God grant my fears may be unfounded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As if to add to my anxiety, I have not heard one word from Hal since we left Alexandria. he and what is he doing? Corps) nearly surrrounded at the Bristoe Station since, by a large rebel force, but they "cute" enough for and loved general for down the Brentsville road, as though going down to Fredericksburg, then turned the flank of the enemy just above Junction, croped Bull Run, and seemed near Centreville. This was on Sunday marched eleven miles making but a few minutes each. When we about a mile from Bull Run, we saw fifteen rebel cavalry.--these were the videttes , so you see how narrowly we escaped. long soon we to remain secure at Cent- for the very next day, they made a deour to to Fairfax, VA, thus placing us again in Accordingly we evacuated C. Banks' taking the direct road to Alexandria, while to Alexandira, while mess went toward Fairfax. Already storm arose shortly after we started. attacked Stevens' and Kearney's divisions.</field>

That night we lay in the rain and mud without fire or ven a blanket. The next day we were delayed by the heavy trains and did not reach our camp- 4 miles from Alexa.- until nearly two oclock at night. The next P.M. we moved next to Arlington Heights,- to the rear of Fort Albany, and as we supposed to go into camp for a few days. But about mid-night orders came to get ready to start for Ports-ville Md. with 2 days rations, at 8 1/2 A.M. We started about noon yesterday, crossed the river at Georgetown, and halted here. Col. Asper joined us, and took command at the Rappahannock, on the 23rd. and is with us at present. He gives very good satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gen Moore is still at Alexandria in the Hospital, and so is my friend Bob Murray (Will Boaden is in Washington. He is recovering slowly. I trust soon to record the victorious achievements of Little Mac. and to hear of the utter defeat or capture of Lee and Jackson.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not recieved a letter from you since we left Culpepper. How soon may I expect one? How lonsome I have been, and am now! Yes, I feel that "alls for the best," I wish I had mor time to write. I would write you 3 or 4 sheets jull, but the mail closes in just 5 minutes so I must close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Don't fail to write soon-- Give my love to Addie mine, and remember me to Dora.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Best assured that although we cannot converse as frequently as we could wish, yet- my heart is with thee forever, and you are continually in my thoughts.</field>
