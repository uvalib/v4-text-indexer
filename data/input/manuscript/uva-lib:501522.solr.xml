      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Feb. 9th "62 Dear Charlie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How the mind will wander, when alone, and what is more natural, than that it should stray “way off” to dear, absent friends. But I am quite confident that it is not Natural as it used to be but, one loved friend, engrosses the wandering thoughts of Addie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My darling Hal has at last returned to his “home and friends”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh! dear Charlie, you certainly can not know our joy at his return but I fear you feel his absence full as much as we do his presence. I know you miss him, and I almost could wish him with you for your sake</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your dear letter, friday I know not why it was that I wept while reading it. Laurie brought it from the office, and immediately I hurried to my room to read it. Something, seemed to tell me that my thoughts would be to sacred while reading it to be witnessed , even by my sister . Darling, did you ever weep tears of joy? I know I did while reading your darling letter. Noble youth! How I thanked God, that there was one, not ashamed to own me as a friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can you be happy in Addie's love? Then my own darling, be happy. For I confess , dear Charles, what, to man, I never before confessed , — my love A pure and fervent love it is incessant as time itself. How long I have felt and known it I dare not own. For a time, I strove to clothe it in the appellation's of “sister's regard” for you. A “sisterly interest” in your welfare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But Charlie, I found that I do not do so. It was too sacrilegious. But I must not dwell on this subject Dear Charlie, cruelly as Col. Tyler in- That you, for my sake, darling do nothing rash. you will not will you? You will not be offended will you? I should so dread to have you get into a quarrel with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am glad that you are going to write for the “Democrat” Bye the by the “Democrat” and “Chronicle” are all one now called by the name of the latter. I was very much disappoin ted at your not coming home with Hal still I think your chances are good. I guess you have been as faithful to your post as any of the company. Laurie says she will answer your “short note” and send in this</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I presume it will be sol so long that I will be obliged to pay double postage. Darling Charlie you will excuse this short letter as Hallie is going away to night and he wishes me to stop writing and sing with him. I will write again in a few days</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me to the boys, meanwhile accept the love and blessing blessing of your's forever</field>
