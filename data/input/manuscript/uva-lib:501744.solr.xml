      <field name="fulltext">Carey Burg , Feb. 5 th, 1857 My dear Sir;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In haste I drop you these few lines to inform you of my health, and family, we are all well and enjoying the blessings of kind heaven. We left Norfolk on the 8th, of Decr. and we were 45 days on our tedious passage from Hamilton roads to Roberts port Grand Cape Mount , were we stop to land some of our immigrants who were destined to the place, and during the voyage, there was none sick of any disease only sea sickness which of course we were not accustom to in no way, before our arrival at the above named; all well and fater than they was before in thier life, and all arrived at Monrovia in the beautiful Receptacle [1] which was brought out by the Rev. John Seys some months hence in good spirits and sound; except myself, wife Susan , and Mary Douglass my daughter, Thos. Scott , David Scott , Chas. Twin , Phil Twin , Geo. Walker , Hugh Walker, Jr. , Winzer Walker , Wilson Coleman , Washington Coleman Martin Coleman , Allen Coleman , Young Barrett Maria Barrett , Isabella Johnson , Chas. Barrett , Dick Barrett , John Mickey , and Washington Mickey , all these I have mentioned [2] leave the ship Mary Caroline Stevens , on the 28 th day of January for this place, which is about 46 miles which is only few hours travel, 15, of us arms our mus kets and march in the roads from White Plains near Millsberg to our destined home here we arrived safe and sound; and we are all here provided for by the Rev. John Seys our excellent Agent who came out here for that purpose; and we think could find no better man for that experiment, no how in the world, who is acquainted with the natives fashion and cus toms , and have already prepare us a loving and fine peo- ple ; and everything is suitable to our taste in every respects and condition. We have meetings in the week on the Sabbath and also Sabbath school; and in the week day school is for us, which is taught by Mr. John A. Claode a native of this country who have been reared up by the good missionary Society some years back who ever thought we would find such a one as this young man is in the midst of civilized people O may God give him grace to teach those who has arrived here late; this school is taught in our receptable as there was no school house has been built for that purpose, but I hope by the assistance of God we shall put up one for school and also will answer for worshipping. I cannot say any thing now about the people until I hear from them again but when I left them they were all well and good in spirits; as for the country I am very much disap pointed to see what beautiful country it is. I dont think there could be any better country found for our colored race any part of the globe, and when we come to behold the natural fruits hanging on our beautiful shady trees, its makes my heart to re- joiced with in me; and I almost exclaim O God thou has hidden many things from the eyes of man, on this this side of the shores and, now we are able we are to see it for ourselves which we have heard of for many years past and gone, but you may assumed that we are long way behind the people of this country for thier in genuity they can make an excellent country cloths which of course I did not expect to see such in the land. I have seen an excellent African cotton which is of the best quality it can be raise by any one if they only prepare a place for it. We find everything good for eatable and also that to make man happy in this world, but most every thing is dear for to buy. My dear Doctor Minor as you fail in given us the list of our tools it was difficult to get it of from the ship, but we have done the best we could and have divided them according to our ability, for you assured we found very a ble for our wants, and we are very thankful to you that you did procure these things for our means, that we are now have the pleasure to say to you what we stand in need off , and we will say that by the Mary Caroline Stevens , when she returns in March we all will remember you all in our pray ers to God, especially your family in preference from and all the rest, they all remember their love to every body, and all are well and have not had any sick ness since our arrival in this mount, and if all meet up with good luck we will unite to all in that neigh borhood.</field>
