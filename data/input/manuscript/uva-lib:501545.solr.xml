      <field name="fulltext">Mecca July 17th 1862 My Darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Even to old Mecca your precious letter found its way and how joyfully I received and read it. Dearest, while reading your noble and true thoughts I can hardly realize that hun dreds and hundreds of miles separate us. I seem to see you and listen to your darling words. your presence seems ever near me strengthening me to bear this ordeal through which I am passing - our separation. But I sat down to answer your letter. How sorry I was dear that you could not obtain a leave of absence. I read the order prohibitting furloughs - even to the sick and wounded. I think it too bad Dost wonder dearest that I read it with a sinking heart. Now Charlie you must be very very careful in regard to your health for should you be taken ill, the blessed boon of "coming home" would be refused and think you I could live knowing that Charlie was ill and suffering : no never! I am glad that you have some more favorable approximation of writing for I have missed your welcome letters very much but darling after g receiving such a reproof I trust I shall never again be guilty of scolding you even if you do not write but once a month . Your rebuke was the more affectual because it was given so quietly but I will try never to mind one again. Am I not a good girl for promissing so readily ? Wait and see how well I fullfil it. So be sure darling. I should love to receive the __ kiss but I should prefer receiving it from a different motive No, no dearest I do not needlessly suffer on account of you and Hallie for if you and Hal should be taken away what oh what would be life ? A wilderness deprived of all its charms?. Do not call it needless anxiety Oh! what a letter her Hal wrote me a few days since. He says "Addie", Charlie is very dear to you, so is your brother but rather than pro- tract this war by a final defeat at Richmond let us both be found dead on the field and let our last words be "Onward to Victory and Union!" Why did Hallie write me such a letter. Ah! how fearfully my heart beat while reading it and it does now. But I will not dwell on such thoughts. Jesus will spare you darling and I know God will. I had not heard of Edwin Williams death His pooor sister Heda ! If she loved him a sincerely as he did her I fear the knowledge was a fearful blow. While speaking of her I have seen the tears spring to his eyes and she would be obliged to leave the room because he would not repress his emotions. How many a noble youth has fallen while striving to supress this rebellion "I think you are a learned man is all the answer I shall make in regard to the remarks you made upon Catholicism You gave me a beautiful description of the 4th. I believe I have written once or twice how I spent "When future favors Charlie will come " When did you not say. "When the coming present favours you" for the future never comes. Strange that you do not hear from Hal He tells me that he writes often to you. Laura has answered for herself and Dora might answer if she would but she she says she does not know whether she is an idiot or a girl of sense for it is so warm and she attended a party last evening and feels the effects of it. You wrote me in regards to Laurie's initiative. Certainly you can have it if she will let you but you may receive a "No sire" I guess not though.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your photograph darling I do not think is natural at least not as you looked when I last also first saw you I like the position very much. I was very thankful for it darling. Oh Charlie if you could but hear the conversation between Laura Dora and Auntie. Dora is just lived enough to be full of fun and let them converse about what they will Dora will make them laugh</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But time flies and I must close write often as you can and may guardian angels attend you in all your wanderings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As ever your true Addie</field>
