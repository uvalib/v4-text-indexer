      <field name="fulltext">In Camp near Woodstock Va. 1 April 7th 1862 My own dear Addie ;-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I know you must be very anxious to know the reason why I do not oftener write to you, but much as I would love to have constant correspondence with you, even daily , yet it seems as if the "fortunes of War", or something else , are against me; Every day since I wrote last—(the last of March 2 ) I have inquired if letters could be sent, and invariably received a negative answer. But I have grown impatient at the delay, so write, hoping to see some one I know, going to Win= chester 3 , with whom I can send this and thus,"run the Blockade".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can see no reason why we should be cut off from mail facilities, as I am sure there is nothing of special importance transpiring in this department that should be kept so profoundly secret, and if it would do any good, I would "enter my protest" against it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Every day since I wrote, we have had shirmishes with the enemy, but two or three men have been killed on our side, and it is known that many of the rebels have fallen victims to the unerring aim of our gunners. Even while I write, skirmishing, and pretty sharp too, is going on about two and a half miles from here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How full of horrors is this unholy unnatural war! No one can fully com= prehend the horrors of war, unless brought into direct contact with it. But it must be repugnant to you, so I will change the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As for "my poor unworthy self," I am enjoying good health, and in spite of my longing desire for some of those canned " goodies " which the noble "Aid Society" 4 has kindly sent to our sick soldiers, I can not get sick . Yet, it is no great loss.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have pleasant weather, and fine times. Chaplain B—I would write Brown if I could—Wright addressed us to-day from Prov. 23C, 32V. His remarks were opportune and well made: if prop= erly applied, would benefit us very much.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The application was like this— "The cardinal sins of the army, are— Intemperance; Profanity; Murmuring; and Robbery. These, sooner or later, will "bite like a serpent, and sting like an adder" The pieces sung, were "Happy Land 5 ; A charge to keep I have,—Boylston 6 ; and Once on the stormy seas I rode,—Bonny Doon 7 ."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It was sublimity itself to hear those old hymns sung in the woods, accom= panied by our band. You should have heard it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Will Braden 8 is sitting by me, talk= ing with Moore 9 ,—subject cowardise . Their talk reminds me of the negro's contro= versy. "Me and Massa had a argument to-day I said corn would grow best on sandy soil, and he said so too. And there we sputed and sputed." He, Will, just said tell her "if I fall in battle I could not find a better death" He had reference to him self. I wonder why he does not write to Laurie, I know he wants too bad enough.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I enclose you a "gem" of Southern literature, a verbatim et literatim 10 copy of a poem found by Sergt Moore. I is a genuine secession document.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My spare time now is employed in reading "Pope's translation of Homer's Illiad 11 ". Did you ever read it? By the way, I received a Tribune from you, yesterday, for which I am a thousand times obliged. Don't you think Carl Shurg's speech was excellent? I read it to the boys last night. My friend, Bob Murray says "you benefited the mess as much as Charley" in sending me the paper. Bob is a noble boy, and will some day make a great man or I fail to be a prophet.</field>
