      <field name="fulltext">Mecca February 4 th 1862 Charlie My Darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you know how sweet those three word sound to me? and also how dear? No wonder I love to linger on these words but I must turn to other subjects. I must give you an account of my "days works." I have been engaged, (I think) in a good work to day.. not as noble a work as you are engaged in, but it is the best that I could do. I have been to the "Soldiers Aid Society" working real hard Do I hear your approval? Oh: how I wish you could have been there.. It is really amusing to see old and young gathered in the "Union Hall" for the benefit of the soldiers. Here in one corner of the "Hall" sits a group of "Mecca Belles" busily sewing bandages or some garment or perhaps "scraping lint." I hope you will never see that, and in another place sits the "young married people" engaged in the same way, while the older laidies are standing over the table and stove cooking chickens to send to the hospitals, What a dreadful night last night was for the four "chickees" A perfect massacre Bye the way Charlie do you not think it a wise idea, that of canning chickens for the sick soldiers, now when some supplies arrive from Cleveland for the hospital just "play sick" a little while long enough to get some "Mecca goodies" But Charlie will not do so will he? dont mind me this time, Dear Charlie, do you wonder at my little simple letters. Laurie has just been here and she would read it I know just by the smile she had on her face that she thought there was simplicity enough about this, and perhaps a slight attack of silliness. May be so but I have tried to make my letters as cheerful as possible so that you would not get homesick. Let Laurie look if she wants too , do you care?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our school closes tomorrow. I do not regret that it does for our teacher has been so faithful in his instructions to Miss Hezles that he has neglected his other scholars, therefore I do not feel much edified Sadie says that he is not handsome but "fine looking" might be appropriately applied to him, any way his mouth is crooked. I may be allowed the expression as our minister used it, that he had been kissed so much his mouth had been drawn to one side</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh: what a benevolent town Mecca is. We have had four donations here from the four different ministers that watch over their flocks and now we are to have one for Mr Duncan the singing teacher that was.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hallie is in Warren again studying. How much better it seems to know that he is not encountering the insolent for He thinks of renting a house and taking his sisters with him to friends over it in his absence. Hope you will make us a visit when the Misses Dignitaries get to keeping house, Charlie I wish you would step in and fix our lamp it is making an awful sputtering. first it will flash out and give a "splat" and then repeat it, but Laurie is getting frightened and has blown it out</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oil city is not dead There are some wells in opperation down in "Dixie" as good as ever were known Mr Wilbur also has started a well which yields the liquid money as well as any on his farm. But as you pass along you would not know that such a thing as "Mecca Oil" was ever known only by the deserted shanties which stare at you and an occasional glimpse of the steam puffing out of the roof of their engine houses. There are but few wells in opperation at present, but what are yeild very plentifully The war excitement has mounted the throne in precedence of the oil excitement.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My health is good yours is, is it not? Auntie sends her double and twisted respects she does not know that I am writing that remark. Laurie is anxiously waiting an answer for her letter that she sent in mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">but it is getting late and I must "away to my couch " write often to your Addie</field>
      <field name="heading_text">n.d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I noticed in a letter from "Julius" the correspondent of the "Chronicle" that you had but little writing paper. I send two sheets when I can get some more I will send some [1]</field>
      <field name="heading_text">n.d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If I was in your place I would send this back for some sense. Addie ate so much supper her thought have gone to the winds,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">adieu Laurie [2]</field>
      <field name="heading_text">n.d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I shall offer no apology for this for one of our neighbors has been in here all the evening talking with auntie [3]</field>
