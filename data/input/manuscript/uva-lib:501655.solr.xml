      <field name="fulltext">Camp near Richmond Va. [1] March. the .16. 1864 My Dear Cousin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I write you afew lines This eavning which will inform you that my self and brother are both well and geting on verry well. and I much hope this may reach you in due time and find you all in joying the best of health and all blesings that our kind Protecter sees fit to bestow apon you all. I have no news of importance to write. we are having a verry still time now in camp. though I am fearful that it will not remain so much longer if wether keeps open. I think the spring campaign will soon commence. and then we poor soldiers will see a hard time. though if it is the will of God for us to suffer why should we complain when we know that he knows what is the best for us and will do nothing but for the best. I feel thank ful that I can cheerfully submit to his will If it is the will of my maker for me to be cut down in this war I dont ask to be spared for I beleave that he will do what is the best for me, thare is but few things that I would ask to stay in this trouble some world for, one great consolation to me is that if I am cut down, I have a hope of a better time in the future whare thare is neither worries and troubles thay was another lot of our prisners got to Richmond yesterday paroled from northern prisons I havent hird of any of my acquantance that came through with them infact I havent hird of any Virginians that came through this time scearsley, I hope that thay will parole all of them soon, I have hird that two of our Co. D had taken the Oath of iligeans and joined the yankee army . thay keep our men thare in thier prisons and treat them so badley that thay become so dissatisfied. thay had almost as live die as to stay thare then thay will get them to take the Oath and jian thier army, though if it is the will of God for the South to over power the North. thier swindling will not avail them any thing in the long run, it may make the war continue some longer. though thay will see that it will do them no good,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oru Our men treat the Yankee prisners bad too though I dont beleave that it is wright I think if thay cant treat them well thay aught to parole them and let them go home, it is not reasonable to sepose that thay are geting the rite treatment, if we were to judge them acording to the treat ment that we are geting , the most that we are geting now is corn meal thay (1 1/4) pound and quarter of meal day which is a plenty if we were geting any thing to go with it thay have bin pretending to gave us sugar &amp; coffee, though it was as near nothing as could be to be any thing atal, it was verry good what tha was of it though thay gave us such a little of it, what we get for two days rations, is not more than enough for one mess then we have nothing but bread the balance of the time unless we provide for our selves, and there is no chance to buy anything here, some time thay gave us a little picle beef or mollasses. We drew some beef last week some bady stole all that my mess got. though we made out verry well I had some butter that I braught down with me from home, some times we got afew peas or a little rice and with all I have made out verry well I be leave that I feal as well as I did when we got meat I dont think that thare is any danger of our sufering while we can get plenty of meal, nor I dont sufer any uneasness about some thing to eat forcause my self because I beleave that thay will provide some thing for the a r my as long as thare is any thing to be had in the country I be leave that thay will take from the Citerzens and leave them to suffer before thay will let us sufer for some thing to eat, I dont want you think that I am either suffering or grumbling by my long serry many about our rations. for I am not I am makeing out verry well, I feel as well as I did when I got a half pound of meat a day,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are camped about seven (7) miles below Rich mond on the chickeyhammey river we have a goodeal of piquet duty to do. though I dont mind that in good wether. it has bin verry cool for several days it snowed some here yesterday though it did not stay meny minutes. I hope it be warmer to marrow as it is our day to go on piquet we have to stay out three days at a time, I under stand that the dead man has got to his command though I havent seen him, well I have writen enough for I havent received a ll letter sence I came from home you must write soon and gave me all the news gave my love to all and share aportion for your self Nothing more but</field>
