      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, 1862 February 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mecca February 2 nd '62 Darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you ever behold such a beautiful sabbath day as this one? I feel more like working out of doors and shouting for joy, than sitting in silent admiration, as civilized people are pleased to call it. But I don't believe they enjoy the beauty one half as much as they would if they were as free as birds. Oh, anything for me but sitting in the house so prim and formal saying just such words, as if they had memorized them, and if you chance to say anything else, blush as if you had been caught in the act of stealing Why, Charlie my darling I believe human beings wander as far from nature as from God. But you, will say is this from Addie , such a commence- ment for a letter from Addie ? I presume that is the fact, does it not agree with your sentiments? Charlie , You do not know the disappointment I shall experience if you do not come home when Hallie comes I had stored away so much pleasure for your return, thus it is with life. How suddenly and cruelly can our brightest hopes be dashed. But I truly hope thus that hope will rise soon. I saw Mrs. Benton at a donations party last tuesday evening, and judge of my surprise when she told me that, her husband recieved a letter from Charlie Tenney . She told me that she heard from Hal, I asked her, how she heard</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She replied that they recieved a letter from you the day before. I presume I looked the surprise which I felt. Ah, indeed, I exclaimed, “Yes, do you know him?"” she asked perceieving my astonishment “slightly” I replied “When you write send my kind regards” Such was the short conversation between us But oh, how I longed to clasp that letter to my heart and read its contents, but pride came to my relief, and I was fearful of betraying my interest in you, dear Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can not you read my character in that short conversation my darling? and do you dare to love the woman, who for fear of a few trifling remarks would put away such a pleasure?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Such you may always find me to be, even if Hallie wished me to throw away the nearest friend I possessed. I have no [unclear] doubt but that I should do it, Dear Charlie , it is no vain talk when I say I would die for Hal for if I had a thousand lives I would willingly give them all for him. I have been writing to him today in preference to you, he will doubtless tell you what I wrote</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wish you to know me before you love me for you know not what a girl I am My nearest friends call me “strange” “unfathomable” Those who have always had the care of me seem to know as much of me as stangers, I think Hallie knows me better than any living creature, for to him I can open my heart freely and fully. When I first began to notice what an interest you took in the wayward girl, your correspondent, I thought it wrong and would exclaim, he must not love me . I had been so used to the appellations of “a queer girl” ”strange child” so that I had imagined it wicked for any one to love me. Even when a little child I remember of being called a “cold and heart- less child” when I so much craved genial love and sympathy Dear Charlie , those I do love, I almost idolize. But perhaps you will call me a perfect egotist. Perhaps I am but I write just as I feel. I should not write thus but you ask me to “allow you to love me” and I wished to inform you of just the woman you wish to love, If you can love this “strange girl” as I presume even you no doubt will call me after reading this you are at perfect liberty so to do. And remember if Addie does not love you quite as well as she does Hallie , yet next to him you are the dearest friend she can boast of and that you always will share her heart felt sympathy</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie : You wrote me assuring me that your was “free from dishonor” I thank God for it darling, yet do not think for a moment that I thought you were not, for I would as soon think the sun would refuse to occupy the positions which God has destined it, as to think that a dishon -orable act rested upon the name of my brothers friend and my own darling friend still I thank you for writing as you did. You may wonder why I send my letter to you in Hallie 's But “ Mecca folks” are very anxious to know who my correspondent is and I am just as anxious to keep them in ignornace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must reluctantly close as it is getting too dark to write more I must however, again request you to come with Hallie , if it is a possible thing with out infringing upon your duties Would that I could be near you and protect you from danger, darling But God will and I must bid you good night. I shall offer no excuse for this silly composed letter for it is from the one you love Addie C. Case My kind regards to Sergeant Moore and Will Breden . Your Addie Sister [1] sends love and Auntie says, I would really love to see your wonderful correspondent Addie</field>
