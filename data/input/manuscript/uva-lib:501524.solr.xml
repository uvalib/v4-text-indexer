      <field name="fulltext">Mecca February 13th '62 Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Art happy to night my darling: I trust you are, and comfortable too. It would seem almost impossible to be comfortable this cold night, but as I have been riding all the afternoon. and I feel the cold more for that. Dora and I went to Claridon 1 tuesday and returned to day. We had a pleasant ride and also visit, but my thoughts would wander from my ride and even from the beautiful</field>
      <field name="fulltext">scenery twixt here and there to the dearest of human beings and I imagined, (rather strange was it not darling!) that if Charlie were with us that ---- I should enjoy myself a trifle better Hallie is not at home to night. How lonesome I get when he is absent, but a short time. Well it gives me a good opportunity to write you which is a pleasant substitute. I was passing through the center of Colebrook 2 yesterday and noticed an artists car. I know not how else I could better express my thanks for your kindness in sending me your Mine Truly than to send you my portrait, therefore I will enclose it in this. 3 If you enjoy the sight of it as much as I do that of yours I shall be trebly repaid for it 4 I am obliged to resort to the</field>
      <field name="fulltext">pencil to finish this for my pens I find are almost worn out. I believe I will make this a news letter if I can find enough to fill it for my muse is rather dull, and I am somewhat tired. Our sleighing has been home on furlough of two or three days for several times, still I have not enjoyed it much. At present, there is about three inches of snow on the ground. The sleighing month of here is very good. There was a donation party for Elder Higbee at his home last evening. he recieved over forty dollars, about two thirds of it in coin. There have been several deaths in town during the first two months one lady died at the age of eighteen. she was married when but fourteen. how cruel it seems for girls to marry so young. I would much rather go to war.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In New Lyme 5 , a man hung his wife last week or they supposed that he did they have been married but three months and he killed her, such is the bliss of married life. He is now awaiting his trial Do you not think he "loved" that one whom he vowed to protect and cherish? I should dread to possess his heart or conscience either. But I am alone and the hour is getting late therefore I am compelled to bid you good night. You will think this a poor apology for a letter I know you will You will write soon and often will you not dearest? Our Father in Heaven preserve thee my darling and guide you near to Him</field>
