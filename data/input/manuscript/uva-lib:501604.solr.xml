      <field name="fulltext">Oct. Harper's Ferry, Va., Oct. 13 th 1862 My own darling:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Permit me to address a few lines to you, hoping to interest you for a few moments. There, is not that in style? Now that I am to correspond with a Colonel 's sister, I suppose I must "put on a little style." I - I - can't , -- dont know how. I evo-(come pretty near writing a naughty word)- rather not try, as I shall do as I see proper, unless there be certain contingencies arising. How is it? Must I?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Charlie is well as usual, and of course as happy as he can be away from thee, so you need not fear for me. I was so glad to hear of Hal's promotion, I threw my cap into the air and laughed for joy. How do you suppose it made Brig. Gen. E. R. Tyler feel when he learned that, that Lieutenant whom he persecuted and affected "taken down." It nettled Lt. Col. Asper considerably. I understood that "he thought the military committee might have selected some one older and more fitted for the position than Case, especially since he had that rupture with Gen. Tyler . Now I think he would like the position himself . but he is eminently dis qualified for any office higher than the one he now occupies. other officers in the regiment, who thought that by taking sides with Tyler they would court his favor, and gain his influences to promote themselves , also feel rather annoyed at his (Hal's) rapid rise For my part I congratulate him and tender to him my warmest sympathies and earnest goodwill. May God be with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I forget that I have two letters from you to answer, and you will wonder why I have not sooner replied seeing that we remain in camp. I will explain. Since I wrote you last we have changed the immediate location of the Camp, our Sabley tents have come, and we had to clear off offas the ground before pitching them, and when we got them up as nice as you please, a lot of recruits came, and it was found that we had not tents enough. Accordingly Seth Coon , myself and another enterprising young man set to work and built a log house, 8ftx10. for our especial accommodation, exclusive of recruits, Said house is heated by means of a stove, manufactured of sheet iron, by our selves, and lighted by means of a canvass skylight. Altogether, when finished (for it is not yet complete,) it will be a comfortable dwelling place for three U.S. privates. My time has been so completely taken up in this work, with my usual "guard duty, (We are now Headquarter guards to Gen. Georg. ) that I could not sooner write - and this is my reason. Now for practically replying.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was not at all pained to learn that you were housekeeping, nor was I ever of young Powers' mind. I not only respect a lady who can act in both capacities but on the contrary, I consider no lady's accomplishments are perfect unless she has a general , if not a complete understanding knowledge of house keeping. Yet I do not hold as a sequence that every lady must , of necessity or choice , be a housekeeper; by no manner of means, yet it is a conveneince , at times, to understand how to bake a little bread, or even to sweep a floor. But do not think that I would make a servant of my wife, not for the world would I. Next your God, you love me but," God bless you . darling, for such devotion. Did you know that your love gives more strength to do my duty, and that "Love makes the hours go lightly by"? No, love I will not "scold" you for loving me thus well, indeed I fear I shall deserve a treatment of that "antidote for wrong" for not being good enough for you. But my heart, my all is yours, and yours forever .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now for the military department of my letter. You make inquiries of Gen. Pope - why he was defeated on the Rappahannock etc. To begin I will make this statement. Gen. Pope , although he should himself competent to handle a single corpo in the field, while in the West; is insufficient in himself to wield an enormous army of 120,000 men. Other men are so, not only in the North but in the South, but unfortunately for us the South understands this better than ourselves, hence, although it was the pop- pular wish of the people that Jackson should be placed at the head of the Confederate Oct. 17 Gen army, he was assigned to only a single corpo d'armee , while. Lee , although lacking in that peculiar quality- dash - was made first in command, because he could plan a campaign on a large scale , and handle the entire force with ease, leaving for generals of smaller commands the rapid moves to. Now Gen. Rope was altogether too fast in making his advances into Virginia , for while he was ing the bold advance directly upon the rebel Capitol , he did not sufficiently guard the flanks . Thus the Valley of Va. was comparatively free from our army, while there should have been a strong force acting in concert with the grand army. And in like manner the line of the Rappahannock from the edge of Culpepper County was left without even a picket line , to within eight miles of Fredericksburg !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will see that as Gen. Pope had his entire army maped in the vicinity of Culpepper, nothing was easier for the enemy than to turn either flunk. When this at last became evident to the worthy General, instead of having Burnside and McClellan come to his relief via Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock , he ordered them to come to his rear by way of Alexandria, and the same course taken by himself, so that is McClellan had been two days earlier, he would have been on the Rappahannock and Washington unprotected ; for the "dash" of Jackson by Lee 's order , had completely outfluncked Pope 's entire army, placing it in the greatest danger of annihilation, had it not been for the timely presence of Gen. McClellan which retarded Jackson materially. But you will say that it was Pope 's men who fought the disastrous 2 d Battle of Bull Run. In part, it was and in part by McClellan 's men, but had it not been for the presence of the army of the Peninsula, the "grand advance" of the rebel army would have been neither more nor less than an assault upon our own Capitol . While we came upon the pahannock , we could see plainly the rebel troop across the river, moving around to our right, and Gen. Sigel requested permission to intercept the movement, (as might have been done by guarding the passes of the Blue Ridge and Thoroughfare Units.) but Gen. Pope told him it was but a ruse, and that he should be needed on the river. Sigel was right, Pope was wrong. The rebels went around, and Gen. Banks corps which was the rear-guard -- just where the advance should have been was once cut off and surrounded, but by the superior skill of Gen. Banks we were extrica- ted . Haven't made the matter any clearer for you. By the way, Gen. Halleck said at the time Pope was appointed that he had but little confidence in him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since I wrote you last commenced painting this, we haven't around our camp down the hill nearer to water but our splendid view is impaired some what; I was interrupted while writing for that purpose, thus we have the labor of clearing another encampment to perform. You ask me who is my partner, Seth Coon , sho has been absent all summer, in the Pioneer Corps, is acting in that capacity now, while my regular partner, Bob. Murray is still in the Hospital, having been surrounded at Cedar Mountain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close this as the boys are waiting for me to help fix the tent. Please give my love to all. not forgetting Addie , and write soon, to Your own loving Charley, It is said that we remain here this winter.</field>
