      <field name="fulltext">Chambersburg, July 15th /61 Dear Henry :-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Once more amid the scenes of confusion and surrounded by the walls of Franklin Hall is Ellic , your old friend, this morning I got in the carriage &amp; was hurried away from the loved scenes of home, by the gentle pace of faithful "Lade" and after two hours ride was again at the place of study, and sur- rounded by the hum and bustle of a county town.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I enjoyed my trip home very much, and consider that I would have loosed a great privilege, if not permit- ted to give my assistance in reaping the harvest; none but the experienced know the value and comfort of county labor until deprived of its blessings. I think a life in the county, surrounded by nature's robes of green, basking in the sun shine of heavenly purity, freed from the clamour and confusion of a county town, breathing in the health and vigor of a county home, and reclining under family protection and affection, one of heaven's richest blessings. It is reported to day that Gen. McClellan has routed the Secessionist entirely, and taken about sixteen hundred prisoners, "good for him", may he ever be successful in his efforts to protect the rights of American citizens. And may his right arm be strengthened by every battle strife, and may God unnerve every arm that would raise to aid in the destruction of this the home of the free and the assylum of the oppressed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henry I did not get to Uncle Michael's , Wallace's , or Kyner's , but I know you will get Kyner's name to your petition without my inter- cession in your behalf. however I know I would have enjoyed a visit with you to the two latter named places, and will hope better the next time I come home, which I hope will be when the huckelberries are ripe. As this is my second letter to day , I will close by asking you to remember me to the people of the pines who are solicitous enough to enquire of me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Friend, Ellic</field>
      <field name="heading_text">n.d.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since this was written Aunt received a letter from Uncle Stumbaugh , he says that Gen. Patterson assures him that if Johnson did not attack him that he ( Patterson ) would attack Johnson before the term of the three months men would have expired, so lookout for a fight the last of this week, or a retreat on the part of the rebels,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours, A.C.</field>
