      <field name="fulltext">Mecca. April 8th '62 My darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Happy very happy was I last night when father handed me your letter of - well I do not know when it was written. for it was dated so many times I think it not necessary for me to fill this sheet with expressions of joy and pleasure. because I was so fortunate as to recieve another of your darling missives. so I will allow you for this time to imagine it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest. you say - in speaking of the “grand move” “not withstanding the “ Seventh” was included we are all safe..” Did you really mean it? was not our loss at Winchester fearful? Perhaps I did not understand you.. I too was pleased when you wrote me of your success in the “letter line” I love letters it is so cheering when far from friends to recieve good letters. as you certainly do if you get mine (ahem) It has been more than one week since I last wrote you. but I have been from home most of the time since then.. Friday I went to Claridon with Dora, and stayed until yesterday I am excusable am I not dear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie. you requested me to send you Laurie's poem. “A Vision” Although that was composed by Laura M. Case. still I do not think my sister. Laura M. Case was the authoress . if she is she does not tell me so. It is a beautiful piece. I will send it to you. I intended sending the paper but it was destroyed throug carelessness . but I saved the poem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you infer dearest from what I wrote of “Fifty years ahead” that I was the authoress of it? I was not nor do I know who was. but I think it was Miss Lucy Logan.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I see Lucy. I will ask here for a copy of it for you. You say you wish me to return your love as you love. Oh. my darling would that you knew with what dpeth and tenderness your love is reciprocated. yes. would that you knew. I would not have thought. one year ago that any mortal. could ever be so dear to me as is my idol. my treasure. Can it be that you are mortal? I feel that your love is not. When I think of that wretched week which I passed through after hearing of the Winchester fight I shudder. and wonder how I lived.. Do you wonder that in the dead of night when all was still that tears. which seemed to sweep away my very heart . would flow. and murmurs such as “Charlie my darling my all why am I not with thee” would escape. But am I becoming tedious? Perhaps I am Oh! yes dearest. I will try and enlarge your list of lady friends. when you come home, which I trust will be soon. I have many lady friends in Brumhill Co. of whom I never spoke to you. There are the Misses Gilbersons (please ask Will. Braden if he remembers them They speak of him quite often) also Miss Belle. Duncan. Lucia Leeland. Libbie Smith. Grace Smith. and many others.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling. I wrote to you in regard (I meant that for regard) to my teaching this summer Did you recieve the letter: Please write to me and let me know if you wish me to become. “school marm”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have no time to write more now dearest for I must send this to the office by Uncle __ Pa's brother. I have not sent your letter to sister over yet therefore she probably will not write in this. Please write very often to your own</field>
