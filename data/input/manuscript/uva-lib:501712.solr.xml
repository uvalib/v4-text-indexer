      <field name="fulltext">Prospect Tennessee April 13 1864 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I Take my pen &amp; paper to write to you again. I am still in the enjoyment of good health &amp; hope that this may find you all the same. We are still here but it is probable that we shall move in some direction before long appearances at least indicate as much. One thing our veteran soldiers have been called out to drill the orders are that we shall drill 6 hours a day so as to perfect us in the drill immediately &amp; target shooting one hour each day for the recruits. Another thing they are making fortifications here One large block house here is nearly finished &amp; I understand that they are going to build another one a short distance from here across the river. So that one hundred men with the aid of these fortifications can withstand as much as one thousand without them It is the prevailing opinion that when they are completed that we shall leave here for more active service. There is also great activity commenced on the railroad that runs through here. a short time since there was not more than one train each day Now there is as many as six each way to carry provisions &amp; stores ammunition etc. to the army south it is likely that the spring campaign will soon be opened vigorous ly very soon. It is about time to do something or the heat of the season will be stronger than either of the contending parties &amp; compel them to lay inactive till another fall. There are some days now that were it as warm north you would say this will make the corn grow. We dont know as much here about the operations of the army as you do where you get the regular papers at the north, but we know more about a soldiers life I am not disappointed I have not had to suffer half the inconvenience yet that I expected to or may even have to do in future but our worst enemy or the one that I fear most is sickness &amp; as long as I can avoid that why all right. There has been a noted rebel guerilla caught not far from here called Moore he has played about these parts considerable robbing army wagons plundering killing etc. since we came here he gobbled up two of our boys who had got outside the picket line in search of a cow that belonged to the regimental hospital but they gave him the slip &amp; got back to camp here again There has been some deserters come to our camp from the rebel army they give a deplo rable account of the condition of the rebel army say that they were pressed into it etc. but no reliance can be put upon them I think that the government are too easy upon those rebels that are not in arms against them. I don't believe that there is one good rebel or union citizen in Giles Co Ten but they are allowed to come within the lines with with passes which the got from the regimental officers signed by the Colonel we have quiet a chance to find out their principal when we go on picket truly many of them have lost their last cow &amp; pig &amp; would just as soon shoot a picket as not but they ought to swing too it makes some of the boys curse &amp; swear to see them round with their butternut-colored clothes &amp; brass buttons as near rebel uniform as they dare come &amp; durst not pull a trigger on them. I have had but one letter from you &amp; I dont know why I dont get more I want to hear at least once a week or oftener &amp; another thing I want some postage stamps I have to borrow &amp; it will soon run out on that score. I must say that H. J. Smith is promoted to first Lieutenant -I conclude Direct the same as before</field>
