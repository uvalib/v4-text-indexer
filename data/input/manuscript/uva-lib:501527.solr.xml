      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Feb. 25th 1862 . My Darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again has my heart been gladdened by one of your "angel visits" how very interesting my letters must be. "Angel visits"! indeed, if mine are such to you, wonder what yours are to me. Well dear one, I am gratified if they interest you for I had thought myself incompetent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You seem quite anxious as regards my health, Do not be alarmed about me dearest if I were not enjoying perfect health I should inform you. It is quite natural for me to wish to know the particulars about yours, for you ar not situated as I am with kind friends around you, but you are exposed to cold and hunger as well as to the poisonous atmosphere that must necessarily be when thous- ands are breathing the same air. Therefore please inform me in every letter about your health. I trust you have recovered from your cold that you spoke of.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest "Yes" was the word you wished me to say, and I have written it. If the tallented and the gifted Charles Tenney can love and accept of Adelaide's love welcome you are to it and as regards my miniature, I presume you have recd it ere this as I sent it by Capt. Aspen. Preserve it my dearling, as a sacred gift. There is nothing that I could give you which could express my love for you as fully as does that; and if you prize it has as hightly as I do yours I wll be more than repaid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am willing dear one to accept of you just as you are a soldier and could not wish you other than you are. How happy I am, loved one. If ever a woman enjoys perfect happiness it is when 1 she loves and knows she is loved in return. It seems as if it was too much happiness to last and that I must yet find it all a dream. Darling Adeline will strive in her poor way to make your life happy. Oh, how I love so to dwell on these dear thoughts, but I must turn to other subjects</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, you did not intend to do me an injustice di you when you asked me if I was jealous of you? Surely you did not. No, I am perfectly willing that you should write to her when and what you please, and should love to have you. She enjoys your letters very very much, I thnk I know the reason of that question. It was about my "wry faces" was it not. When Laurie wrote that little note of hers she told me she was going to commence it with "Sister Charlie" I laughingly told her if she did I would not send it with mine hence her on "my faces" which she wrote about. Thank Fortune that ugly "green eyed monster" has no influence over me. How unhappy I should be if I had not confidence enough in one I love to allow him to correspond with my sister. The idea is perfectly ridiculous so please dearest never again allow such a thought to mar your happiness for it certainly must make you unhappy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie, dearest, try to suppress your ill will towards Col. will you not at least while you are under his authority. Please do. Perhaps Hallie was in the wrong in writing these letters although that seems almost impossible but he ought to have been more careful what he wrote. You will not seek revenge for Hal's insults will you? He can not wish you to. In the letter you wrote to Laurie you said "the pen is mightier than the sword" Dearest do not strive to prove it for I fear if you do you will meet with powerful opponents. Even if you do write under a fictitous names are you not fearful of your letters being intercepted?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps you will think me writing about that which I ought not or which I have no interest in. If so forgive me and I will do so no more. But I have not time to write . Write often dearest your letters are so welcome</field>
      <field name="fulltext">meanwhile believe me I remain yours forever Adelaide</field>
