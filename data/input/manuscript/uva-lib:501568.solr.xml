      <field name="fulltext">Charleston Va. Oct 1 st |61 My dear Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will doubtless think I mean you shall have enough of my non s sense but perhaps it will be as heretofore, you may not get this. However, I will address you once more. "I am well as usual, and hope these few lines will find you the same," and having a few moments liesure I improve the same in writing to you.-There,- cant I tell a thing two or three times if any one can? It would be a pleasure to me to be in Mecca, to-day. I could enjoy my self, "right smart, I reckon" and the Virginians say. Mecca, I suppose is not so lively now, as last year at this time. of course the War produces its awful effects even in Oildom, does it not? I, you percieve, am off the boat now, the Valley has become so quiet as not to need a guard, so we came off last Saturday</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charleston has been the scene of great excitement, during the past few days. Last Thursday, it commen-ced raining, and it rained heavily, too. till Friday night. Then the River commencing to swell, it continued rising until Monday morning. and the whole town was submerged, whole houses were carried away and every person in town suffered more or less. It is painful to go through town and see the devastation every where visible. The place was a second Venice, the people went about not in gondoliers, but canoes skiffs, and on floats. I went yesterday.- the waters have nearly subsided now--to one of the houses to assist a "secesh" lady to remove her goods, and we found the furniture nearly ruined. A splendid new piano stood in the Parlor, and it is almost spoiled, I would not now give one sixth of the original cost for it. Splendid paintings were entirely ruined. Oh! it is too bad but it cannot be helped The more superstitious say it is on account of the war in which we are engaged the it was sent as a judgment upon them, and I have no doubt of it. At the house where I went, there was a very pretty young lady, (not as much so as Addie though) by name of Helen Caldwell, on see- ing the ruined state of her piano and music burst into tears and exclaimed "I did not care so much for my ward- robe, but my poor piano", It was poor" It is feared much harm will be done down on the Ohio at the different towns but I hope not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not know when we shall leave here. I hope before long. for it is getting rather unhealthy here. and in fact it would be much better if we should move. Hal's health is good &amp; he is now acting Adjutant here, as Adj. DeForest is at Ganley Bridge. Capt Asper is now on a furlough home and consequently Lieut Wood is commandant of the Company. Some thrity of our men are now at Camp Ganley under command of Lieut Robinson of Co. G. I do not know why they went or what they have to do. Co's B &amp; D went down to Pt. Pleasant to lay a telegraph. to day. But you will consider this more as a newsletter than a letter of friendship or regular correspondence. I am very glad you promised to correspond with me, for it is a source of much pleasure to me I cannot forget the many kindnesses you showed me while at your home (I almost feel as if it were my home) I often wish my sister would evince as much feeling and interest in my welfare as you have already shown, but though I have written two or three times to her and the rest of the family I can get no reply whatever. The last time I wrote I told them "I could write no more unless they thought enough of me to answer my letters." Now Addie what do you think and what would you do? Hal 1 is a brother to me and has been ever since I became acquainted with him. He is so kind and good. I don't wonder you love him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hope for his promotion soon. and I think he soon will be will recieve one too, surely, no one deserves it more. than he does. He is already the pride of the Seventh Regt Do you know James Beebe ? he joined this company under the three month[s?] enlistment What is he doing now? Is he at Mecca now? The company did not like him very well for some cause</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And 2 Stephen Bishop too. You know his folks. do you not? How are they now? Some how to me it seems as if he does not care for them as he ought and indeed I have heard vague rumors that he did not take proper care of his family. Is this true?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. Give my respects to Laura and all other inquiring friends. and Dear Addie write soon to yours ever and truely Charley Tenney. To Addie</field>
