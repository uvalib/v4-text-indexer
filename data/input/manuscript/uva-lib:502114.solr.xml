      <field name="fulltext">Dec 28 th 1864 Office Chimbo Hosp No. 3 Richmond My dear Sweet Sister</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The ever dear white winged messenger from your hand of the 23 d just came duly to hand yesterday which found me comparitively well &amp; truly glad to hear from you. Tis useless for me to undertake to give you an idea of the pleasure it affords me to receive a letter from you or to discribe the feeling &amp; interest with which each &amp; every line is carefully read. Would that I could be the recipient of such dear letters every day but truly it is a pleasure that such a character as I do not deserve. Well Christmas is over, it past very quietly with me I met with no gay crowds or rather visited no place where there was merry making. Christmas day I went to Church &amp; heard a very good &amp; appropriate Surmon delivered by Doctor Duncan of this City in the after noone I called on a friend for a Short time &amp; at night went to Church again. Thus past the day making the fourth Christmas Since the war all of which I have spent away from home. The only treat I had during this Christmas week was the receipt of you Ever welcome letter which was handed me yesterday about noone . I am just learning how to appre ciate such pleasures. it was always very agreeable to me to correspond with my friend, but situated as I am now makes it doubly so. a way from my home &amp; among Entire strangers leaves me quite a lonely life, it is truly more monotonous here than it was in all my Experiences in camp. tis true, I believe that I have made many freinds while here but I am deprived of the social comforts that I enjoyed with my company for there, I have a fond brother whose society has been the greatest source of my pleasure ever since I have been old enough to duly appreciate a brothers love and were I deprived of a correspondance with you dear Kate - dreary, &amp; all most comfortless, would be Every hour of my life. Just think what a pleasure to have some dear loved one who, though separated from me by many miles, still I have the pleasure of speaking with though it be through the silent medium of the pen, tis truly gratifying believing as I do that I am honored to night with this pleasure of writing to one who loves me with a pure sisterly unselfish love on whose word I may, with impunity confide, believing that her pure heart knows no treachery, one whom I love above all others of her sex, save her to whom I have given my heart &amp; hand, with the promise that the arm &amp; hand which wields this pen shall shield her fragile form, through a life time that I hope may be as pleasantly ahead as the few short hours are now in writing to my dear Sister Kate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You stated in your letter that you wished to know how many brothers &amp; sisters I have. I have four brothers &amp; four sisters. There are nine of us in all. My Father and Mother are both living. My Father is nearly 75 years old. My Mother about 66. I am the youngest son living, I have one sister younger than my self. She is the youngest child &amp; she is grown. Well Kate last Tuesday the 20 th one year ago we parted a day Ever to be remembered by me. what wonderful changes has taken place since that Eventfull day. Twas there &amp; then that I gave took the last fond looks upon one who has made a lasting impression upon me though I never (at that time) Expected to see or hear from you again but so forcibly was I impressed though you and strangers as we were these lines presented them selves to me. "We met as perfect strangers, "But when we came to part "Love had improved its image "Upon my throbbing heart And upon the impulse of the moment I determined to write to you regardless of the result which I did &amp; am proud to say that I have never regretted it. I have found that my ideas of physiognomy &amp; human nature in my slight observation has served me justly. you have proved to be the realization or rather the result of my course has been a realization of what might have been termed a castle built in the air for you are all that I had fancied you were in my silent musings simple language, a pure hearted kind affectionate good girl .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well dear Kate, I will not impose any longer on your patience, but will close my uninteresting &amp; uninstructive letter. you must remember me kindly to your dear parents &amp; your sisters. say to your Sisters that I am glad to hear that they are so merry hope you all spent a gay Christmas. I wish I could have been with you, tell miss Molly that I did not get light but probably it was for the want of spirits. tell her not to leap to soon - who knows but what Lou may give me a sacking - the Old Augusta then Rose Dale might have increased charms for me, goodby dear Kate I hope miss Molly will pardon me, for my bold suggestion. with my warmest wishes for your wellfare &amp; happiness,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain as ever affectionately Robert</field>
