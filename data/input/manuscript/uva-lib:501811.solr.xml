      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia November 3. 1859 — Dear Brother —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It has been but a very short time since I wrote, but as you have assured me that my letters did not bore you all, I have determined to write again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask what is generally thought of the late unheard of, unprecedented affair which took place at Harpers Ferry?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Citizens of Charlottesville at least, look upon it as a very serious thing and have appointed a Mass-meeting to be held to night, for the purpose of increasing the military force of the Town &amp; County, so that they might be prepared when occasion call for them. I should like very much to attend as Mr Leake and some other gentlemen of note, will addres the meeting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not believe that those seventeen men could have been so desperate, so foolish and so rash as to have come in Va. for the purpose of liberating the slaves without promise of assistance from some quarter capable of furnishing it. True they say, they expected the slaves to rise up in numbers and join them, — I rejoice in their disappointment — but do not believe this was their sole reliance: many a freedom-shrieking fanatic of the north had promised his arm &amp; his money to the cause, but a more deliberate reflection taught them the folly and futility of the undertaking and caused them to break their promise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If the Abolitionists were not the most consummate fools in the world they could see that the legitimate tendancy of such an outbreak as this, is to make the masters more rigid with their slaves: but so boundless is their love for the slave &amp; his freedom that they take not into consideration these trifles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I almost think you will catch the game over the river as each sight seems to give renewed animation to the pursuit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you continue to take John over with you? It may be that each has grown so bold &amp; independent, as to be entirely careless about the company of the other. I suppose your next visit will seal your doom — and you will be ready to exclaim “what concentrated joy or wo is there in blessed or blighted love” I hope you may be able to quote the above with as much life, as you used to quote your favorite lines from Young , beginning “To recriminate is just &amp;c.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you say that stages were running from Urbanna to Richmond or to West Point? Although Christmas is sometime off, yet I often think of it and since the facilities are so great for getting to Middlesex I would be at all surprised if I spent a day or two with you about that time. More of this in the Future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is a good deal of drinking here — but I am happy to say that my most intimate friends and con- sequently my companions, generally, are tetotalers . therefore I am free from all temptation on that score.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time has come for me to go to the Post Office &amp; as I have no news to tell I will stop so that I may take this up to the P.O. with me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my best love to Ma — Aunt E. relations &amp; friends and to any one else you choose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Keep up your good practice of being prompt &amp; Believe me your Affectionate Brother E M Healy</field>
