      <field name="fulltext">Fishers Hill October 15th 1864 My dearest friend,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved you long looked for letter yesterday. I eager- ly broke its seal, &amp; berused ove its contents; you cannot imagine with what angsiety I had waited I had begun to think that prob ably you ware sick; It seemed an age since I had hurd from the one I respect above all others, you can well imagine my uneasineſs Sometime I thought I had been forgotten; then again some gay lad might have changed the current of thy affections &amp; you feared to brake the news to me, I supposed you had not recieved my letter of the 21 s st &amp; 26 th   I wrote 4 pages the 21 st then wrote two on the 26 th but the mails ware very unragular about that time, know doubt it has come to hand over this I would like very much to have got home while we ware camped in the lower edge of the county. I could have gone when bart of the boys went, but I was not very well &amp; the time so short I did not feel able to make the trip, While at Wanesburro, I visited my Uncles Was very much pleased with his young wife, She is a very nice lady &amp; seems very kind to the motherleſs children, Cous Mat give me a regu- lar scholding for visiting them so often &amp; hoped that I would not be so distant in future, She said it took all my time to visit the Trouts while at home I tried to make her behive better but she would not listen to me, While camped at Bucks Mills I visited Mr, Browns was kindly treated She said that if I went back that he would write to you that I was carried away with the Misſs Trotters. Thay are very nice girls &amp; I think would please most any man of moderate taste; We have orders to moove &amp; it is late so I will have to close for the eavning, 16 th We are laying quiet this beautifull Sabbath morning I wish that I ware some plase that I might go to the house of God &amp; try &amp; spend the day in his servise The 13 th we had a little brush with the enimy before Strausburg We drove them back in double quick capturing several hundred prisners I think thay ware surprised in meet our Infantry, the prisners said thay expected to find nothing but Inbotons Cavelry. The 14 we had a slight skirmish with some Cavelry I don't think thare was any loſs on eather side, We are camped now in rear four old fortification at fishers hill I believe our army would make a very hard fight now. All want to wipe out the old stain of Fishers hill &amp; Winchester I think the people are to hard on Early The army has not entirely lost confi dence in our old , leader I fear he uses to much of the poisened water but do,nt think he is ever past tending to his duty. as he is our leader we ought to all have confidence in him, or he cannot gain no import tant victories, Cousin R Brand was badly wounded at Winchester &amp; left on the field of Battle, John Wright got to camp last eavning, &amp; Robert &amp; Luke Taylor the eavning before, We have thirteen now for duty. I will keep up with the rest of the comp. in the regt, My health is very good at presant, and hope this may find you the same, We have orders to clean our guns for inspection. Invariably we have to violate the sabbath by having inspections on the holy day I must soon close My kindest regards to all enquiring friends; recieve my love as the best token of our frenship,</field>
