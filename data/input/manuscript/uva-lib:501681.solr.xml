      <field name="fulltext">Camp Near Petersburg March 22 nd 65 My Dear Kate</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I have a good opportunity to send a few lines I hasten to make use of it. My health is very good indeed &amp; hope this may find you the same, I have no news worth communicating, Thare are a thou sand diferent rumers afloat. Gen, Johnson {1} attacked the eni my at Bentonville North Carolina {2} &amp; drove them back one mile captur ing three peices of Artilery &amp; some few prisners when night came on &amp; the conflict ceased, The enimy during the night was reinforced with fresh troops &amp; fortified. thair position, I hope this is only the begining of favora- ble news from Johnsons Army It is reported hear that the enimy attacked Longstreets Corp in thair entrenchments on the north side of the James, the 20 th charging him three succeſsive times &amp; was each time hansome ly repulsed. I pray almighty God to give our men brave hearts &amp; strong arms to withstand the shock of arms this spring so that we may be able to teach our foes that we can never be subjugated while we can raise an army, We are camped Near Pete rsburg. Our Corps relieved Ander sons We are camped in line of Battle. The Enimy are camped l in line of battle half mile in our frunt. Thair Pickets are about two Hundred yards in our frunt, &amp; our pickets fifty yards in frunt of our breastworks I am on picket on third of my time, The duty is not very hard in daylight, but after dark you have to be very wachfull we are not allowed to sleep during the nights we are on picket The Yanks seem to be very sociable I believe if it ware not for our officers the men would all be laughf ing &amp; talking together. in fac the Georgians on our right are constantly trading papers &amp; topa cco for coffee They call us all Johnnies Thair is no firing in our frunt, But is kept up con stantly after dark in frunt of Roads {3} Div. I declair it looks like foolishneſs to see men thus opposed to each other to be fight ing. I am certain if this war was left in the hands of the privats peace would soon be adjusted. Thare was right smart mortor shelling hear the th. It is a magnificent sight to witneſs mortor shelling after dark, But is not very plesant to be exposed to the dangerous misles, Many are under the impres sion that thare will be no regular engagment fought hear I hope it may be so. This is any thing but a beautifull camp. Most of the men llike groundhogs live under the ground I do'nt think it will be very healthy hear in the summer season, Our foes have agai n been desecrating our once lovly valley. Thare raid was a very suc seſsfull one. They done a great deal of damage to our railroads &amp; canal, But I will hope on &amp; hope ever that thare is a better day comming, If you see brother John try &amp; use you in finance in {4} getting him to return to his old comp. both brothers have a notion of joining some cavelry command I would rather stay would not do so at presant. I have written a long letter to J. advising him to return hear our cavalry papers came back disapproving Dear Kate believe me to bear thee the same strong &amp; pure devotedneſs that I have hear always expressed I must close soon write as soon as convenient give me all the news generally Now may a great &amp; good God be with thee &amp; thine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain yours with all the tender devoted neſs of true love William</field>
