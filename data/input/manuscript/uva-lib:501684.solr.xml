      <field name="fulltext">Your letter of the 30 th of Apr. came to hand last week &amp; I have been reflecting in what maner to answer ever since I will use candor; &amp; be brief. I cannot do you; &amp; my self,- justice unleſs I write in the same style my last was composed. I have been laughſed at &amp; ridiculed on my sad &amp; indifference to pleasure of late, &amp; what caused it; yes the cause was your hapineſs , but how I am ever to accomplish that, is beyond my scope of comprehension. I fear the conse quenses of marrying when my af fections are not satisfied would probably endanger both your future hapineſ &amp; mine. From the tone of your letter you seemed to be under the impres sion that I had formed an attachment to some lady of wealth. I can positivly affirm that I never have addresſsed no lady, with your exception, Your letters &amp; and ring, you requested to be brought back. I am sorry it is not in my power to bring the letters into exis tance I have had no private place to deposit them, tharefore in your summonys they ware all committed to the flames Your ring I will bring or send to you the first oppor tunity. My letters I hope you will burn or destroy in some way. most convenient with your feelings. I thank you for your kind &amp; holsome advice I sin cerely wish this day; that I was at peace with God; I know I am a sinner, &amp; will be lost unleſs I change &amp; seek forgiveneſs of him who gave us our being. how I pray thee not to let mal lice eradicate evry feeling of respect in your person for me, God knows thare may be a change &amp; I may race the day of my blindneſs,-But do not wait on me; I will not attempt to allure you with any rash promises. The long long past was all brightneſs &amp; sunshine but alas now all is dark yes dreary in fact I have not a charm to bind me to earth I will not commit to you the many evil thoughts that has filled my mind Probaly our corispondance had best seace I will leave it to your discretion, My health is just tolerable. I hope this may find you in the best of heath &amp; your cheek blooming with the freshneſs of spring- Please do not let any one read this letter as I do not wish to have any weeknesſs exposed; I will close hoping you will still remember me in your prayers</field>
