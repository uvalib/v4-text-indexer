      <field name="fulltext">Camp Kelley Va. Jany 30 th 1862 Darling Addie :--</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conflicting emotions have tossed me about, all unmindful of my poor heart, fairly disturbing my rest at night, until to day. To add to my trials, my best friend, and brother, Hal . yesterday started for home. How sad I felt! But I could not bear to pain his noble heart, so I strove to appear cheerful. I did not send even a line to you, by him , something restrained me--told me I should soon recieve a letter from you--. and I could not-- dare not write in my. (then) unhappy state of mind. True enough, when the mail arrived this morning, a letter came for Hal . My heart told me, that in that envelope was a letter for me. Lieut. Boisbine , for me, opened it and my heart was gladdened. Your letter found me well, and made me happy. I say "happy." Hope was infused into my heart, and with Hope comes Happiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest Addie , I know how the world views such things as the only objection you offer but I am not of the opinion of the world, nor do I allow myself to be governed in my actions or judgment by the world. You "confide". / thank you kindly for it / if it were not for that one thing . you could love me, and say I am too good to be united to you. Oh! dearest. do not think so for a moment. I love you. fondly. truely. God knows my heart. that I could not. would not conquer my love for you for what others may do, or have done. God says every one must be ans werable for their own deeds. The world judges wrongly in attaching blame to one person for what another has done. I consider that i person is not worthy the name of "man" if he will close a correspondence, or even change his feelings, for any such cause, I could not I am too independent of the world</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now. Addie , darling, you will not cast me off. and say "I cannot love" will you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If your heart says you can love me, is it wrong? My heart tells me that I do not love in vain. How happy I am in the sunshine of your love. What fascinated me while at your house? Dost know, Addie dear? Twas you . That feeling of admiration has ripened into deep unchanging love. I do not write ignorantly. I have carefully analyzed my feelings, and know what I write.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Happy in hope,, I await for--your consent for me to love you, as mine . Mine ! Mine to love to cherish! I know the poetry of your soul have felt its power. Iam--when alone--a poet. Not a Rhymer. but a love of the poetry of Nature</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must turn to other things. You should see us now. Far and wide, all is mud. a perfect sea of mud. I was up to the camp of the 29 th yesterday. to see a friend of mine-- Sidney Crosby --it was the same mud</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How sorry am I that Hallie has gone We shall not be able to find a man to fill his place. Not a man has done so much for his company as Hal has for this. But I cannot blame him I would do the very same if I were in his position. Addie . Tyler shall yet feel my power Hal 's insult is too grievous to pass by lightly. I shall remember him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going to correspond for the Democrat But Hallie will tell you all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">McClellan has dampened my hopes in regard to my coming home on furlough but I must not complain, for he is my commander you know. But Brisbine says I may come next July, provided we take Winchester previous to that time. My chances are good are they not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, I must bide my time and believe Addie loves me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. One word more. Addie, love me . From your own devoted Charlie To my Addie . Geo. Moore . Seth &amp; all your friends send their respects supposing I am writing to you. I have sent your letter on Laurie I do not know which to Hea[l].</field>
