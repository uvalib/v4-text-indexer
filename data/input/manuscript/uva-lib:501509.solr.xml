      <field name="fulltext">Mecca October 27 th 1861 Dear Friend Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I again had the pleasure of perusing one of your kind and interesting letters last saturday and I can assure you that it afforded much pleasure. Charlie if you could witness the eagerness with which I grasp your letters you would not hesitate to leave your work to write to me. But of course I would not ask you to if you could not do so with convenience . I think you must have received another letter from me since you wrote about the 12th of this month. This is a beautiful day rather cool but not more so than we should expect for the season. Mr. James Beebe of Ohio Seventh is here. I do not feel so much like entertaining him as I do Tenney of said Regt and therefore act accordingly. He is trying to guess who I am writing to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There has been quite a bereavment in one of the families of Mecca lately Perry Barton of whom I mean was married or, rather, entered into the blissful state of matrimony about four weeks ago and Saturday morning he was found dead in his bed. He died in a fit of apolexy His brother died about three years ago and now as he had arrived at the same age that his brother was, he too is cut down. How strange is life and how uncertain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So you imagined that I would think you was writing , did you. Well Charlie I know just how much flattery and sentimentality to believe It is an old saying that and too true that it is natural for women to desire be some flattery. But in many instances it fails to prove its self at least it does with me for "I had rather kissed than flattered &amp; as the "old maids, say. Do not turn and say "I dont doubt that" will you Charlie I feel as if you, or I mean, I would enjoy singing a little while would you come and assist me. Got a cold, did you say? Oh well then I will excuse you I attended a Union ball last Friday evening given in honor of the Sixth Ohio Cavalry which will soon go to Warren I enjoyed myself very well but should have been better pleased if some of my absent friends had been present I will allow you to guess who I mean</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh Charlie I have a compliment for you from your Captain. He said that Charlie Tenney (do you know the gentleman) was the (now prepare for the worst) best boy--I mean one of the best boys in the Regiment</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There I would that I could be there and see you turn pale with surprise (ahem But Dear Charlie I guess you will say that I am writing the nonsense and you the sense wont you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I will be obliged to close for tea is ready will you walk out and sup with us? I wish you could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Take good care of your health And may may heaven spread her protection over thee , Dear Charlie, Is the heartfelt prayer of your friend Addie</field>
