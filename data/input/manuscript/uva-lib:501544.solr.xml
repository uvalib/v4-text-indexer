      <field name="fulltext">July 6 th 1862. Colebrook Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Independence day has passed and I have not seen you yet but a darling letter came for me, and I must be contented with that. But you will wish to know where I am and why I am here, I am in Colebrook. Ohio on my way home. Would you believe that I could get turned out of school? Well I have a vacation for three weeks. during haying and the district wished me to close school during the haying season, Mr Marlow and lady (Mr. Leslie's son-in-law) was over the 4 th and he (Mr Marlow) volunteered to carry Dora and I to Mecca, what could we do but close school. I did not wish to have a vacation as it will be so late in the fall before my school closes but found it necessary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a dear kind letter yours of the 21 st was. it did me “lots of good” I see that you are still going south farther, If you could only come north west. a few hundred miles. I should be much better indeed</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The punishment which you recieved from Gen. Tyler did not seem to affect you very much. I should have been afraid to have asked if you had not recieved permission to walk on the railroad before punishing you, If he had ordered you to be court-marshaled you would not have remonstrated would you Charlie what will be done with Gen. Shields The people here are losing all confidence in him. And Gen. Fremont has resig. =ed. Do you not think Fremont has recieved another injury by his superceding and do you blame him for resigning? I was delighted with the discription of that storm you gave me. Is it not strange that although such storms bring distruction with them yet there is also a charm that we can not resist. What is more grand and terrific than a thunder storm, I do so love them. I always feel better after viewing a storm that caused such wild commotion in the heavens It speaks in such strong language of the majestic power of God.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest Charlie, I know not what prompted me to ask that question refered to in your last; unless it was that irresistable longing to be ever near you. forgive me dearest for expressing the thought for I did wrong, I can not as yet: no I can not yet become yours, I know darling that you share the tortures of this absence with me and that it is very very hard for for you to remain so long in the service of the U S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I know that I have not recieved your Photograph yet. but I anticipated the reason why. I have seen Mr Richardson several times since the “Mile Society” but I never expressed my recognition of his “friendship” more than by a slight bow, Indeed I can not do other wise. there is to me some thing so repulsive about him. Among the Clar'ndon people he is termed a perfect “lady killer”(pardon the expression I write at just as it was given me). Dora will write you and give you some thing to laugh over. half an hour if she does not put on her “sobr drys” as she some times does. for you will have enough to read if I do close now, Remember me to the boys if you please and write very often. as often as possible to your own</field>
