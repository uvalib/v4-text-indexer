      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Charles to Addie, October 24 1861 Maj.Gen McClellan Published by James Gates, Cin. Printed letterhead, vignette, portrait of Maj.Gen McClellan</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Camp Warren , Oct 24th 61 Charleston Va. My dearer 1 Addie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I commenced to say, involuntarily too, dearest Addie. Would it have been right? You would not have remonstrated would you? and then it is just the way I feel anyhow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your sweet little letter of the 12th I received yesterday morning and you can imagine if you can with what joy and pleasure I read it. Perhaps you can form some idea of the longing and impatience. with which I watch the arrival of the mails for a letter from Addie, when I tell you that Addie is the only corres- pondent I have. Now you dont wonder why I want you to write often, do you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, I flatter myself. (not you ,) that I have the prettiest and best correspondent, that soldiers "or any other man" commonly have. that I feel that I am worthy of your kind attention, but I love to have some one to whom I can turn and know and feel that it is indeed a friend. Such I believe my Addie to be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not think I mean to flatter you, for it is the truth, and then you told me not to try to flatter you, and I won't do what you dont want me to. 'Twas a happy day for me when I saw you first. But perhaps I am becoming oppressive,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am on guard today and am now momentarily expecting to hear "First Relief, fall in ." then comes two long hours of steady marching up and down a long "beat." But then after that I have four hours rest. The Regt is out on Battalion drill. in front of the camp, on our parade ground. The boys have be- come very efficient in drill. It is not as easy to "form close column of attack on fifth company" while on double quick time, as it was to "change front on sixth company" while in Camp Dennison. but of course you do not know what- those commands mean, so I will stop talking Military. You should see us.[.] on dres Parade; and see what a neat appearance we present, There is to be dreſ Parade this afternoon at 3-oclock. How I wish you could be here to see us</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our camp is situated two miles up from Charleston. and is a very beautiful camp indeed. Our Regt is now all here and our band too. I do not know when we can get furlough. Nor does Hal. When he comes, though we cannot tell when it will be, I will probably com- ply with your request. and come with him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not think there is any danger of my falling in love, very deeply with Dora. while you are around, But you may give her my kind regards if not incompatible with your wishes. Also remember me to Laurie. and tell her I remember her advice. But my kindest regard are yours and I remember you kindly and affectionately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must now close as it is nearly Three oclock and -"First Relief, fall in" . Did you hear that? I did. Write soon and long letters. I remain yours affectionately and forever Charlie P.S. Would you accept a kiſ if I were to enclose one? Burn this up wont you? Seth and Will send their respects to you and Laurie Your Charlie Mecca Ohio 1</field>
