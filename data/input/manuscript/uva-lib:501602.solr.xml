      <field name="fulltext">Loudon Heights, near Harper's Ferry, Va., Sept. 26th 1862 My dear sister Minnie :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very many days have elapsed since I last indited a letter to you, but you have been by no means forgotten, but while we have been tramping over the hills and vales of "sacred Virginia ," and "Maryland, my Maryland," my mind has often wandered away up "where the water tastes like ile ," and delighted itself in calling up hours never to be forgotten. But this is not telling you why I have not sooner written. Since we evacuated Cullpepper on the 19 th of August , until we came to this point, (the 23 d inst.) we have been constantly engaged in all the duties and troubles of an arduous cam- paign . When the rebels performed that astounding feat of outflanking the seat of war itself, we lay in a state of fancied security on the Rappahannock, never dreaming that two weeks later we would be fighting in Maryland , yet the deed was accomplished, and even Fredericktown a union city was invested and in feste d by a subtle and cunning foe. Of course, Maryland must be liberated, and who should do it, but the "Splendid Army of Va." Thus by a series of "forced marches," adroit escapes from a surrounding enemy, and "brilliant reconnoissances," we were transferred over into MD. hitherto to be known as "Capital defense army," and we have accomplished the task. — Maryland is free from rebel tread, though pol- luted by rebel dead. We have fought the battles of South Mountain and Sharpsburg, and the rebel army went out of Maryland 40,000 weaker than it entered. We — our Corps d'arm ee - occupy Loudon Heights below the far famed town of Harper's Ferry, and from the elevated position we occupy. we naturally feel above common people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now my sister, condsidering the fact that we have been employed in such a manner as to make it impofsible to write, and that I have successfully "come out" of the "Waterloo" of America, am I not entitled to your pardon for my un- willing silence? Why I have scarcely written more than a line (until yesterday.) to Addie, and not a line to any one else. I trust there will be no more such painful pauses in our correspondence: surely there will ^ not be if I can have my will. Raking it for granted that you have kindly forgiven me, I will devote the remnant of my time and paper to some other subject. *How ludicrous! I was carelefs, pardon the mistake. I gave a description of the late battle of Antietam or Sharps- burg, to Addie; also a description of Loudon Heights, and as her school is closed ere this, you will have seen the letters. I recieved a letter from you--dated "Farmington, June 20th"--on the 9th of this month, and dont you think the news was fresh? Well it was, for I had not recieved a letter for a long time before, and coming from one whom I esteem so highly as your- self, it was doubly welcome. You spoke of the Battle of Port Republic. I was not in that en- gagement, as I felt it my duty to remain at Suray "cos vy," I was decidedly unwell. Since then it has been my fortune to not only witness but to take part in two of the most sanguinary struggles of the war, viz. Cedar Mountain and Sharpsburg, and through the infinite mercy of God, I pafsed through both with- out recieving a scratch. I often wonder, in my hours of meditation, if it is not the purpose of God in this war, to spare my life for some unknown purpose, to do his work. He truly deserves all--and more than I can render in his cause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was very much interested in that part of your letter, relating to Addie and her school. You, as a teacher, not to say as a sister, ought to be able to judge if any one, and I am very willing to believe you when you say she is a "good teacher." Indeed, I predicted in the Spring, when she first informed me of her intention to take a school, that she would prove a capital Tutor. I am not particularly biassed in her favor, because I love her, but the above would have been my verdict in her case, had I been an entire stranger. I wish I could have been able to reply to your inquiries about our mutual friend Will sooner, but circumstances were unfavorable. I did see the letter you wrote him, and can say without any reser- vation, that he was highly delighted with it. It was not too free, if I could judge from his actions, as well as words.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What he said, would not become me to disclose, but let if suffice me to say, he prizes you as one of his best and--guess the other word--friends. His greatest trouble was fear lest he had overstepped the bounds of propriety in wri- ting to you as he did, and he was too much pleased at learn ing that you were not offended, to judge rashly--as he must, had he been offended at your letter. Will is a noble man I am proud of him as a friend and will be more so as a --brother. He is at present, I learn, at Fort Ellsworth, in command of 150 recruits for the 7th, but he has not fully recovered from his wound. Charley Brooks is with him, 2nd in command. We have just had an installment of 40 recruits, of whom 16 were afsigned to Co. H. I think it is most too bad to recruit up this Regt. and keep it in the field, since it has been reduced to 85 men, for duty, while other rgts, as the Ohio 4th, have been allowed 3 months to go home and recruit. However, we have had the honor of participating in five engagements while the 4th has none to boast of. Will, if our Country needs the immolation of all the 7th to preserve its Nationality, it has only to make the demand: the 85 left are as true patriots as ever crossed steel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sister mine, how shall I prove the gratitude I owe and feel for the generous interest you evince in my welfare. God will reward you. I little dreamed when I introduced myself to you, that I should in a year address you as a sister. But how little we know the heart. You will accept a brother's love will you not,--for I hope at no very distant day to --well, I --I wont tell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I am way down to the place where we see "finis," so I will close this uninteresting letter by promising to write again at an early day. Please give my love to your Papa and all the rest and (Addie will give you my address)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">write soon to Your Brother Charlie Please tell Miss Debbie that the interest she feels in soldiers is fully reciprocated by them, as I can well testify, for I am "one of them." I am gratefull for her well wishes. Please return my compli ments, with best wishes for her welfare. Yours Etc. Charley</field>
