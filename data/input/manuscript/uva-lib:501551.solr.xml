      <field name="fulltext">E. Claridon Sept. 15th 1862 Dearest Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recd your darling letter several days ago but have had no opportunity to answer it. I had looked long and how anxiously for some missive to assure me of your safety and was almost ready to give up in dispair when the welcome assurance came. I did suffer darling very much but I never for one instant thought you thoughtless . No. for I know how often your would write had you had an opportunity that you would write to me daily could you do so. I trust you can soon remain 24 hours in a place so you can write me that "much" of which you spoke, for I must confess I need it to cheer me up a little. Such a dark and gloomy position is at present presented to our view that I can not help but partake to some extent of the same nature. I am glad that your confidence in Gen. McClellan is so unsha ken for here at the north his star is fast- waning. The defeat of Gen. Pope was attributed to the failure of McClellan to bring up his troops, and it has been published in the Cleveland Herald that McClellan's reason's for not bringing his troops up was that that they were too demoralized to trust them them on the field . If that was the reason--if our army of Virginia. consisting of hundreds of thousand of once efficient and brave men. have become demoralized so that they can not be trusted on a battlefield, then we are truly in a fearful and destitute situation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But to change the subject. My school closes next saturday. I can not say that I am either sorry or glad. It has not been so much of a confinement for me as I last spring anticipated. I have spent many very many pleasant hours with my scholars. Perhaps this summer has been spent more pleasantly with me in the school room than it would have been had I remained at home in fact I know it has for the duties which have rested upon me have in a great measure beguiled the loneliness which otherwise would have oppressed me. But I have missed the kind faces of friends and often sighed for their companionship but then you know I can not always be with friends at home. But dear Charlie it is nearly school time and I can write no more if I would have this go out to day You will write as often as possible dearest , will you not ? God help thee darling and protect thee for your own</field>
