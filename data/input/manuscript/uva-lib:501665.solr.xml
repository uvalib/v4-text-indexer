It was the first time I have been in her company for the last four year; She is a very nice lady.

      <field name="fulltext">Thou shalt not, O my love. Ever hear my voice in rage I will bear all thy anguish wild, Thy grief — thy pain; My arms shall be around thee day by day, My smiles shall cheer thee on thy homward way. In sickniſs, I will be, Watching beside thy bed, In sorrow thou shalt lean on me, Thy aching head; In evry struggle thou shalt conqueor prove For death itself shall only us ever part</field>
      <field name="fulltext">from your true friend Willie</field>
