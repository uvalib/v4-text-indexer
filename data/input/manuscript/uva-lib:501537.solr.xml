      <field name="fulltext">Thursday evening. May 6 th 1862. Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With a thankful heart I recieved your precious letter tonight of the 28 th ? and cheer- fully devote myself to the pleasure of answering it. I wrote ou last eve informing you that I had commenced my school. You are mistaken, dear one, I shall always be "Addie" at least I hope that to you I shall. No difference if they do add the appel -lations of "Mistress," "Teacher" yet from under these coverings a strong semblance of Addie may be recognizable. Yes darling, you heard aright in your fanciful vision when you imagined hearing a chap- ter read from the Bible . I should not feel my-self worthy the name of teacher, if I could not open my school with a chapter from God's Holy Book. I also have my scholars learn a verse from some portion of the Bible , which they may choose and repeat just before the close of school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must tell you of a little instance that transpired this morning. Two little girls Kate and Mary Page have professed a good deal of resistance -tance about reading in the morning and it was with no little persuasion that I could get them to read. They gave no reason why only that they "didn't want to". To night I asked Libbie Arm- strong -- one of my scholars if she knew the reason She replied that their entire family were infidels Oh: Charlie: what a thought! The girls cannot be over ten and twelve years of age. Charlie dear, as you have so kindly offered your assistance to me if needed, will you please tell me how to act in this instance. You did not think did you that I would so soon apply to you, but I do not know how to act. I cannot compel them to join in our morning devotions, but I should so love to have all join. That one act has caused many a painful thought so take possession of my heart. You also heard aright when you seemed to hear me addressing those little hearts left under my care, in accents of kindness. (Did you see that great drop fall on that other page? How provoking) I did so wish to gain their love and confidence and how freely they gave it me. Perhaps my voice did tremble slightly for it made me tremble when I thought of the responsibility which rested rests I meant upon me. Dearest if my letters produce such an effect as to cause your head to ache. I will -- Oh: ? ! I will ? no such think.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You request me to describe Claridon people. When I say it is lovely romantic and beautiful it is described. Its occupants, I have not as yet become acquanted with except my scholars. Yes, I "board around" or at least am going to. I am at Ms. L-- to night. I will give you my "experineces" as get is. A lovely place it is, south of my school house. Hemlock trees of all sizes are to be seen. You ought to see my school room decked with Hemlock boughs and wild flowers, it is so pleasant. Charlie my darling, you already love me far better than I deserve, but nature will show its self. Do not take back any of that June fountain of love which flows so tenderly towards your Addie! "Is Dora to be one of my scholars?" What an idea! Bless you did I forget to tell you that she teaches at East Claridon ? Yes dearest; I feel that God will strengthen me in my duties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How very thankful I am that the "Blockade" is raised. You do not know how I missed your letters No. Charlie; I can not think it would have been right for me to have engaged a school with out-consul -ting you, for, darling, some time you know I am to be yours forever . How happy the thought is to me, that at some future time I can hear you utter the words "My Addie" and feel that I am only yours. Oh, Charlie, "Does my heart condemn me for loving you"? Never, no, no, never dear darling friend nor never will. If you only knew how very very thankful I am for your love you would not think my heart condemned me for offering any finer love in nature. But no, it is a deeper forever feeling than I ever before experienced. Oh darling would that I could some way show you what a devoted teacher and incessant stream is my love for thee my own. No such thing about the unworthiness being "beyond your house"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The feelings of the Reserve in reference to McClellan is about the same as yours, that his honor depends upon his affairs at Yorktown 1 . No. 2 dear. I shall not be offended at your advice, far from it. I am very very thankful for it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dora lies her sweetly sleeping.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She retired some time ago. Bless you! What time do you think it is. Almost eleven o'clock.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good night, darling, a fine and holy life should be thine if thou went home, but the angels may give it thee is the wish of Yours Addie Dora sends her love.</field>
