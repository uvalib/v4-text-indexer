      <field name="fulltext">Dec 19 After school Dear Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have returned from school but how should I answer your kind letter: If I should answer it as I recieved it; it would be with bitter oh, such bitter tears. Should I tell you why I wept? No, dear Charlie I cannot now perhaps I never can, but be assured my reasons are resistless. Dear Charlie my spirit has striven to watch over and guard thee, and hourly &amp; fervant prayers has risen to the throne of Grace for your safety. But that prayer was only as a true and loving sister would pray for a brother. I have striven aquired any other feeling save a sisterly love and Dear Charlie I if I have caused any other feeling to rise in your heart save the feeling of friendship I entreat of you to forgive me for I did it unintentionly. And if you cherish such feelings toward me Dear Charlie for my sake and for the sake of your future happiness quench them. Promise me that you will. Only rem em ber me as a sister or a friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One would perhaps conclude that I was the affiancied of an- other, but dear Charlie, thank God I am not --this may seem strange to you and if you demand my reasons lay the case open before God, and he may give them. But dear Charlie ought I to be recognized even as your “Ohio Sister,” ; I fear if you knew my reasons you would but curse me, but it is getting dark.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, Morning of December 20 th , 1861</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Friday Morn. Dec 20th Dear Charley,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I thought I should finish this, to me, painful letter last night, but found myself so excited that I could not. I will now try to do it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie, how your last letter saddened the heart of Addie. In speaking of the possibility that you might fall in the defense of your country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, dear Charlie you would be deeply regretted by Addie. She would be deprived of one true friend . But I must dispel such thoughts. I regretted very much your leaving Charleston. I fear that you will be in a much more dangerous position at Romney than at Charleston. but to Him who watches the sparrows when they fall would I commend thee my brother.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My efforts to protect thee are vain without His assistance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will send this by Capt. Wood when he goes to his company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please send me your address as soon as convenient.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurie sends love. Believe me yours in sisterly love, Addie</field>
