      <field name="fulltext">Nov 2th 1863 Camp Dale near Brandy Station My Dear Friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved your letters by your Pa last Friday night was truly glad to hear from you. My health is not very good I have been suffering for some time with a bad cold &amp; coughf &amp; headache through the day time I think I am getting somwhat better &amp; hope ear long to be myself again. hope this may find you enjoying health with all other worldly blessings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have sad news to communicate in this; Brother Thomas is no more; He was killed in the skirmish near Bratton Station the 26th of last month poor Bro never new what hurt him he was shot in the left breast the ball ranging through or near the heart. I never new what it was to have a brother shot down in battle before. It seemed to me at the time that if I had have been owner of the Confederacy I would have given it to have life restored to his inanimate frame once more I got his body hauled back to our camp near Brandy I tried all day long the 27th to get a furlough for John to take his body home but failed Mr. Anderson came down the eav of the 27th &amp; I got him to start back next morning with Brothers corpse. Oh it will be a severe blow on Pa. He had been from home as it ware , but a few days we ware born, &amp; we must die. The time allotted to us hear below is short indeed. If we stretch out over hands, we may almost touch the portals which terminate the path of our mortal pilgrimage. If we listen with attention we seem to hear the labour of him who is engaged in diging our graves. And if the holy spirit is pleased to open our ears, we may already descern the sounds wich proceed from the celestial abodes, Listen oh my soul to the warming voice, with the deepest attention, "All flesh is grass &amp; the glory of man is as the flower of the field, fresh &amp; verdent in the morning. It adorns the meadows, the sight is gladdened at its beauty, &amp; it sheds sweet perfume around, In the eavning it is cut down &amp; withered. The glory is departed &amp; it tells us that a few hours must suffice for earthly enjoyment I will trust continually in God let come what will I know it shall be for my good The drum beats &amp; I have to go on drill just came. Your Pa starts home in the morning I had hurd how badly Mr. Neff treated Kate B I am sorry indeed never would have thought Neff to be such a man I must say I was duped in him. The person that told your Ma that I knew he was going to fool her was certainly mistaken for I never spoke of such a thing any one poor Kate has my simpathies Tell Lizzie I wish her much luck but she must not get married while the war lasts so all her friends may get to see her off. Did I not write to you my reasons for not getting to see your Cous Lizzie before leaving Staunton If I never I will now. I was runing around through town untill late then I went out to the provost camp fully intending to come back before dark but your cous, insisted on me staying with them &amp; that I would have plenty of time in the morning before the cars would start so I stayed Early the next morning I went to town the first plase was to Mrs Stevison Shop &amp; thare was no one thare then I went to the post office to try and get some postage stamps &amp; thare thare was no one up so I waited awhile then went back to Bro S Shop &amp; no one had came yet I was about to start to Mrs S dwelling house when the cars warned me by thare whistle they ware about to be off I was sorry indeed that I did not get to see Miss L before leaving town as I only had a few minutes conversation but I was to blame for idling my time the eavning before hope she will excuse me as it can not be helpt now I could not have stayed all night as I had Brother Tom to take care off . I recieved the cheese you sent me was very thankfull indeed as it was a nice little treat then the giver made it so much better you sad you would like to send me a box; Dear Kate you know I dont expect such things but your noble heart is so kind &amp; generous that you seem to never tire in giving I hope the time is not far distant when I may constantly eat of your paking . Poor Jinnie she has bad luck hope her wound will not cost her a docter fee. Again you admonish me to quit chewing topackco It is my only toothache preserver I had quit chewing for a day or two when my tooth commenced aching I immediately recommenced using the weed The drum beats for dress perrade It is nearly dark &amp; I will have to close my letter they boys are generally well Hunter complains of the rhumatism Bro John is well I would write more but we have no candels I ask your simpathies in my late berevement I will have to have my tooth pooled then I will try and quit chewing If I sucseed I will let you know you must write soon</field>
