      <field name="heading_text">Milton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yet some there are that by due steps aspire To lay their just hands on that golden key That opes the palace of Eternity. Comus</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A spirit pure As heads the spangled pavement of the sky The gentle Philadel Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Imperial rule of all the sea-girt isles That like to rich and various gems inlay The unadorned bosom of the deep. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But first I must put off These my sky-robes. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On sands and shores, and desert wildernesses. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What chance good lady, hath bereft you thus? Dim darkness, and this leafy labyrinth. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In such a scant allowance of starlight Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And thou shalt be our star of Arcady Or Tyrian Cynosure Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By the gaily-circling glass We can see how minutes pass By the hollow cask are told How the waning night grows old. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">All I hope of mortal man Is to love me while he can Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">See! here be all the pleasures That Fancy can beget on youthful thoughts. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Losing youth is losing all. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The heart is wiser than the schools The senses always reason well Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nor sighs nor murmurs but of gentle love Whose woes delight—what must his pleasures then? Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thrice upon thy finger's tip Thrice upon thy ruby lip. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And yet more med'cinal is it than that Moly Which Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When day never shuts his eye Up in the broad fields of the sky. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And from thence can soar as soon To the corners of the moon. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Taught by virtue you may climb Higher than the sphery chime Or if virtue feeble were Heaven itself would stoop to her. Ib May thy brimmed waves for this Thy full tribute never miss May thy billows roll ashore The beryl, and the golden ore Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He must not float upon his watery bier Unwept—nor welter to the parching wind Without the need of some melodious tear Lycidas</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Were it not better done as others use To sport with Amaryllis in the shade Or with the tangles of Neara's hair? Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise That last infirmity of noble mind To scorn delight, and live laborious days Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore In thy large recompense, and shalt be good To all that wander in that perilous flood. Ib</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What power? what spell? what mighty force if not your learned hands can loose this Gordian Knot? Hymns devout, and holy psalms singing everlastingly. What needs my Shakespeare for his sacred bones An age of labor in a pile of stones Or that his hallowed relics should be hid Under a star-y-pointing pyramid? Who would not sing for Lycidas ? he knew Himself to sing.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Sonnets.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O nightingale that on your bloomy spray Warblest at eve when all the woods are still!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Donna leggiadra, il cui bel nome honora L'herbosa val di Rheno , e il nobil varco, Bene è colui d'ogni valore scarco Qual tuo spirto gentil non innamora.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fair lady whose harmonious name the Rhine Thro' all her grassy vale delights to hear But were indeed the wretch who could forbear To love a spirit elegant as this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Guardi ciascun a gli occhi, ed a gli orecchi L'entrata, chi di te si truova indegno.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ah then—turn each his eyes and ears away Who feels himself unworthy of thy love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Amor lo volse, ed io a l'altrui peso Seppi ch'Amor cosa mai volse indarno</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Love has will'd, and oftimes Love has shown That what he wills he never wills in vain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Questa e lingua di cui si vanta amore. This is the language in which Love delights.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Parole adorne di lingua piu d'una, E'l cantar che di mezzo l'hemispero Traviar ben puo la faticosa Luna.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Words exquisite, of idioms more than one, And song, whose fascinating power might find and from her sphere draw down the laboring moon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Madonna a voi del mio cuor l'humil dono Faro divoto: io certo a prove tante L'hebbi fedele, intrepido, costante De pensieri leggiadro, accorto e buono.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To thee dear lady with an humble sigh Let me devote my heart which I have found By certain proofs not few, intrepid, sound Good and addicted to conceptions high.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quando rugge il gran mondo, e scocca il tuono, S'arma di se, e d'intero diamante</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When tempests shake the world &amp; fire the sky It rests in adamant self-wrapp'd around.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth Stolen on his wing my 3 and 20 th year!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lift not thy spear against the Muses bower The great Emathian conqueror bid spare. The house of Pindarus when temple &amp; tower Went to the ground: And the repeated air Of sad Electra's poet had the power To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">That would have made Quintillian stare &amp; gasp</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Rail'd at Latona's twin-born progeny Which after held the sun and moon in fee.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Licence they mean when they cry "Liberty".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher Than his Casella , whom he wooed to sing, Met in the milder shades of Purgatory .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meekly thou didst resign this earthly load Of death called life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But as Faith pointed with her golden rod Followed thee up to joy and bliss forever. Eve'n them who kept thy truth so pure of old.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Till Favonius re-inspire The frozen Earth , and clothe in fresh attire The lily and rose that neither sow'd nor spun</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The better part with Mary &amp; with Ruth , Chosen thou hast.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The breaking of that parliam t : Broke him—as that dishonest victory At Cheronea fatal to liberty Killed with report that old man eloquent.</field>
