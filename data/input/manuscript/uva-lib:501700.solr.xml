      <field name="fulltext">Camp Carter July 8 th -61 Dear sister:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Knowing illeg. your anxiety to hear from us at this time, after receiving Andrews letter, I write to inform you that we are both well, except that Andrew is somewhat wearied &amp; broken down from a march of about 11 miles on yesterday, under a broiling sun &amp; some dust &amp; but a little water, we forming the rear of about ten or twelve thousand soldiers &amp; consequently were crowded out from the wells, that being the prin- cipal source, until the middle of the evening when we fell back from the main body. [1] We that is Jackson's brigade, Johnston having gone to Winchester camped in the woods last night &amp; this morning marched to this place about 3 ½ miles below Winchester . At our last encampment we were placed in an open field, under a burning sun &amp; orders to be at your posts &amp; had to stay there for four days. The enemy were all the while stationed at Martinsburgh 6 ½ miles off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">General Johnston sent illeg. to Gen. Patterson who is in command of the enemies forces to send away the women &amp; children from Martins burgh but he refused &amp; sent back word that if he ( Johnston ) would lay down his arms &amp; return home the he ( Patterson ) would forgive all past offences. Gen. Johnston offered him battle for four days, if he would come out of Martinsburgh but he would not do it and John s ton thinking his numbers too great being at lea st twenty five &amp; perhaps thirty thousand &amp; a reinforcement of 5 thousand at the Potomac at some point between Harpers Ferry and Shepherds- town and his position too strong, thought it advisable to fall back &amp; so we have had no battle yet, but on Saturday evening [2] a dispatch was brought to the General that our pickets had been driven in &amp; that the enemy were advan- cing: we were soon drawn up in battle array &amp; advanced to a position, after having been on the field about illeg. two hours, we were taken back to quarters, it having turned out to be simply a fight between the pickets; the enemy not coming. Jackson on that morning received a letter from Gen. Lee congratulating him upon his promotion to brigadier General, the letter came in advance of the official announcement. While on the field the two Generals made a review of the troops Johnston of all of the forces &amp; Jackson of the Virginia brigade.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I like Johnston's appearance very well; I think he is a very prudent commander: indeed the same is true of both: you know "prudence is the better part of valor." [3] What is going to be done I don't know; the soldiers never know the intentions of their com- manders until it comes to execution; so we here in camp have as little idea of an intended action as you. I suppose the Yankee papers will glory over our falling back as an inglorious and precipitan retreat; but call it by what name you please I think that Johnston knows what he is about &amp; am very willing to obey his orders, although it did pester me a good deal for a while &amp; does yet somewhat, to go at things as it were blindfolded. illeg. Even suppo- sing that we could have whipped them, it would have been at too great a loss of life &amp; consequently it is more prudent to retire. How soon we will have an engagement I can't tell you; but there must be one at some time or another.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The result of the fight that took place on Tuesday the 2 nd I suppose Andrew gave you very correctly; on our side illeg. three killed &amp; four or five wounded. The most reliable report we get illeg. in regard to the loss of the Federal forces comes from Mr. Boteler , a brother of Hon. Alex Boteler , who says he had it from the quartermaster of their army to this effect: that there were illeg. from three to five hundred in killed &amp; wounded however true this is I think that there is no doubt that their loss was considerable. [4] The number engaged on our side was illeg. the whole (except one company) illeg/ of Harper's regiment and one piece of canon : on the enemies there was supposed to be about 3000 a great many of them being regulars. [5]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since writing the above I illeg. hear through one of our company who has been at Winchester , that they are throwing up a breastwork about one mile on this side of town; which looks very much like making a stand here, I didn't suppose however that we would retire beyond Winchester .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Billy Wilson received a letter from home, a day or two ago, which brought the news that Edgar Wilson , whilst capping his pistol, shot himself in the foot, shooting off one toe &amp; another almost off. [6] I heard from Gam Dalhouse a day or two ago, he was then improving with a prospect of getting well. John D. Brooks [7] &amp; all my acquaintances are very well. We have just perused yours and aunt Martha's [8] letters. On their way down McComb and Baskins [9] heard at Bunkers hill , a village between Winchester &amp; our camp, that we had sent back all the baggage, except so much as we could carry &amp; accordingly left their knapsacks there &amp; our letters with them &amp; did not get them again until this evening. Aunt Martha wrote that Mr. Lee was taken prisoner by the Georgians, our own troops. I didn't understand it at all; he has not turned traitor has he? [10]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We heard yesterday that Lincoln message recommends calling for 400,000 more men &amp; 400,000,000 of dollars. I don't illeg. know where he will get the money from. Andrew joins in sending love to all at home and Uncle Ben's [11] . Remember us both very especially to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Murkland ; we would like to be there to see them, but more especially the folks at home. I was sorry to hear of Father's sickness but I hope ere this shall have reached you he will be restored to his wonted health. I regretted very much not seeing Willie and Elick Murkland . illeg To night Andrew is pretty well again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have nothing more to write. Your brother William Tuesday morning We got our bag gage last night &amp; will get a clean suit &amp; send it off again. Excuse the dirt Can't keep Clean hands on all occasions. Tell Emmett that it is im possible to get a likeness taken here. Good bye WB [12]</field>
