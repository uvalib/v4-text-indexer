      <field name="fulltext">My own loved Addie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here I am once more in Virginia-- again on sacred soil. Not only in Va. but way up on the Blue Ridge, where the very clouds are often under our feet. It would be very pleasant, if it were not for two very serious drawbacks.-- It is quite cold, and we have to go down the mountain half a mile for water, There is a kind of Block house up here, from which and we have a splendid view of the surrounding country, particularly to the north and west. We can see the church-spires of Martinsburg with the aid of a field glass.- 21 miles distant and were it not for intervening hills and forest we could see Winchester. Away as far as the eye can reach the Alleghenies raise their lofty peaks, far above the heights of North Mountain and the Shenandoah Mountains both of which intervene. As far as romance goes, this is by far the most interesting place we have been in.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, we are here, and romance of reality, we must bear all without a murmur. I wrote you from Maryland Heights a few days since, just to assure you of my safety, and said I had two letters to answer. Last evening, I was again gladdened by the receipt of another of your priceless , and as there is our prosepect of immediate removal, I thought I would devote my time to replying to the three still unanswered, so "here goes."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was very much pleased with your description of and comments upon the marriage of Mr. Hathaway. Indeed, I think if I were a lady, and were engaged to a young man, at such a crisis as existed at the breaking out of the Rebellion, I should have strenuous my to the reserve of our glorious Union; and if he were disposed to display the white feather ,-- as in the case of Hathaway-- I should have summarily dismissed him as unworthy the respect not to say love of any patriotic minded person. Indeed in any estimation, the love of our country should be paramount to all but the "love of God." If I do battle for my country; am I not vindicating the cause of all we hold dear? -- am I not resenting an insult to every loyal heart; whether male or female? Most assuredly I am, and, should count myself unworthy the least of your notice, my treasure, were I to sit idly by, at this moment. Turly "coward is his name. "Love honor, and obey." God bless you for your outspoken indignation at such a man. So you thought our national sky very much darkened, about the 10th of Sept. Has the osbcurity been removed at all within the past 10 days? Yes, it did sound stragely "Maryland and Ohio invaded." and one would have thought we stood sadly in need of a man of nerve and fortitude, as in truth, we did, but has not Gen. McClellan sustained all I ascribed to him? Has he not resisted the charges of "Ultra" peep of the north, such as daily emanated from the N.Y. Tribune?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You know the Tribune has always claimed to be the organ of the Union party? Well, its influence in the border states has been anything but favorable to our cause, -- on the contrary, by its indiscriminate attacks upon Gen. McClellan, and other generals who did not precisely agree with that sheet, in every political point of view, however slight. It has tended to sow distrust and discontent. I have conversed with very many of the Army of the Peninsula, both officers and men, and they love McClellan with a feeling beyond mere respect. No one knows the result of an engagement better than the men who participate therein and I have not conversed with a soldier, officer, or private, who will say that McClellan was defeated in either of the battles before Richmond but on the contrary, they say that in every case, the enemy was driven from the field. But in the case of the six days fighting where the aim of McClellan was to change his base of supplies to a point, where if he could not have the cooperation the troops promised hims by the Secretary of War he could at least be in a position where the famous Raid upon Tunstall's Stn. could not be renewed, -- in this case, each day, with its victory, left him in a situation equally as critical as at first, so the only alternative was to secure his point at Harrison's Landing, as he had not the support requisite to an advance upon the works at Richmond. But those cavillers, ready to use the least seeming advan-tage to cry down a really good general, put their fingers to their ears, and ran toward Fortress Monroe, crying defeat, defeat. I know not what the "C. Herald" based its assertion upon that Gen. McClellan's army was demoralized, but if I know anything of a body of men,-- and having been in the army 17 months, I ought to.-- then Gen. McClellan's army was very far from being demoralized, but on the contrary were in a high state of discipline, though very faint and weary. The plain truth is, if any army was "demoralized", it was John Pope's-- a portion of it commanded by McDowell notwithstanding the Herald's adoration of Gen. Pope. I am sorry Gen. McClellan has no more friends in the north, but I am sure if the people of the north knew this brave man as well as the army does, they would say with us, and against the N.Y. Tribune "he is the man for the times." I venture prophecy-- Gen. McClellan's star shall rise, and the nation will praise his valour and statesmanlike conduct. Have you not noticed that the Herlad, &amp; Tribune have all along evinced a disposition to condemnation our noble president? The aim is the same-- to destory the present administration as Secretary Seward told G.F. Train a few days since "Put out McClellan and break up the administration." You ask "what will become of the country?" I will tell you as "Mr. Seward told Mr. Train-- "You cannot stop God's waterworks; the great wheels turn around, the wheat comes down, the big millstones move, and the wheat will come out flour in all good time." Be of good cheer my love to me the prospect seems clearer than it has since at any time for the past three months and we must recollect that "tis darkest just before day."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our men "conquered" no, never: while a hundred patriot hearts remain, a traitor shall not prosper. I admire your adherence to this belief, and that you may never have cause to change yours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But you made inquiry about "the boys". "Is he [Gen. Moore] my friend too?" A naive question, turly. Of course, he is. Who is not, who knows you, or have seen your lovely features? But he is really your friend, and often requests to be remembered to you. I must tell you what he told me once on his return from home last winter. Said he, -- "Charlie were it not that you have a better claim upon her affections, I would be tempted to love her myself. She is the most interesting and noble young lady I ever saw." How he learned that I love you, I could not say: I never told him, and yet he said, "she loves you." George is a noble boy, (boy-ha!-ha!) and is doing well, I learn. John Chafee was in the engagement at Culpepper and at Sharpsburg, from both of which he came our all right. He is well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bishop hasx never been wit the regt since the Winchester Battle, and we recieved official notice of his discharge a few days since. No one mourns his exit from the company--"requiescat-in pace." The other boys are doing well.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now that "Maryland, my Maryland" is liberated from "southern scum", the apprehensions of the North must be relived in a measure. Certin it is that Pennsylvania is safe, and if we soldies of 17 months standing made be allowed to judge the rebel horders might be driven to a more genial atmosphere to their polluted hearts than the north, and that in double quick time. Here is one thing which inspires me with confidence in "Little Mac." In conversing with a capture rebel lieutenant, he told me that "so long as Pop was in command, they entertained no fears but that the incusion into Maryland would prove a sweep; but as soon as Gen. McClellan took command, they began to tremble. For while they despised Pope, they respected and feared McClellan." He said that "he for his part, knew as soon as he learned, that he had taken Pope's commany that they were a whipped army. Is not proof from the enemy conclusive?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not yet heard from Hallie. yet I supposed he has been mustered out of the service ere this, and resumed his duties in his office, has he not? Addie, has your paper ever mentioned to you the fact of my writing to him from Alexandira, asking his consent to our union at a time specified by you? I wrote you concerning it from peper, but I guess the letter has not been sent, and is still in the Captain's trunk. I recieved for a reply one which gave me great satisfation, and which places me under a thousand obligations to your- our father He says "If it is your and Addie's wish to connect your destinies for life, you shall have my best wishes and approval, unless that I shall learn of some dishonor attached to you or her."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Those words have given me most unalloyed pleasure, and ought I not to be grateful? Truly it was a happy day for me when I first saw my darling Addie. You have a good Father and may God grant that I may always enjoy his love and esteem. I am patiently waiting for this unfathomable war to be terminated, so that I may return to claim my precious one; and at the same time I pray that ours may not be the wedding of a Hathaway . How I wish I had materials for sketching? I would like to send you sketches of the things of interest around the memorable "Harper's Ferry." Here is the ruins of the arsenal which John Brown took possession of at his famous insurrection. and the Engine house where he confirmed his prisoners,-- the ruins of the bridges across the two rivers,-- the rocky crags wehre Brown was wont to observe the proceedings of the people below, and a hundred other interesting scenes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But as I have no conviences for carrying the materials, that pleasure must be forbidden. But I percieve that my space is fast becoming limited, so I must soon close. Then I have written quite a lengthy epistle have I not? and does it weary you to read so long ones? You must write soon and good long letters, and remember that your Charlies is ever faithful, and though he may sometimes be in a situation where he cannot write as often or as extended as he would like, yet he will do so as often as possible, and will try to make them as interesting as is possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my love to all and write soon to your loving Charlie .</field>
