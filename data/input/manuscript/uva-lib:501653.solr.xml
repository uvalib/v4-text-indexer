I havent hird the particulars about the fight, though it is reported in camp that the yankees took one company of the 57 Va. Regt prisners I dont know wether it is true or not, I am verry glad thay whiped the yankees back without our having to go down thare , for the roads were mudy and it was raining the most of the day, it is mostly clear to day and verry bloustry, it has bin warm the most of the time sence we have bin here it is much pleasenter here than it is in northern Va and every thing is much cheaper, we can buy potatoes and turnips here for (3.00) three dollars per bushel by going 5 or 6 miles from camp, the most of the citizens in the country seem to have a fine chance of pork in fact everry thing is more plentyful here than it is in Va whare the army has bin, we have got an awful bad name sence we have bin here, the soldiers dont like the N.C. nor the N.C. dont like the Va. soldiers, some of the soldiers does act verry trifling it is enough to make any body mad with them, thay will steal, some times thay go out and steal potatoes and hogs, the Gen sent an order here the other day for the men all to be turned out on the parade ground and then search thair houses, thay did not find but verry little meat in our Regiment though thay found good eal in the 53 Regt I think thay found two (2) whole hogs in one company; I hope the thiefs will be sevierly punished for doing so and I guess thay will the man that had the meat in our Regt has desirted sence he was caught in his meanness I expect he will go to the yankees, he was a verry trifling fellow at his best I think any man that will steal like thay did aught to be whiped with a cow hide, I have said enough about the rags [2] unless I could say some thing in thare favor and it would not do for me to say too much about them I might be caught some time my self, Some body stole upwards ($18 000) eighteen thous end dollars from the QM of our Regiment a short time ago the soldiers were charged with it and I expect some of them got it thay was an old Lady who lost a skillet of soup last night and she came a round to day searching the soldiers houses for it She did not find it in our Regt She went to the 53 Regt I haven't hird wether she found it or not it is reported that Gen Barton [3] said that his Brigade was composed of rags and thiefs for they were rags before thay left home, I think he had better make some acceptions or mind how he talks ani, if he only new it is not healthy for him to gave honist people such a bad name because some men does wrong, well thare is no news nor interest in this to you so I will stop it,</field>
