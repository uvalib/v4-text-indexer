      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore May 29th 1829 Dear Pa ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am now going to make a request different from any I have ever yet made - As I wrote you, sometime since, I have been several times to visit Mr. Wirt, who had treated me with great kindness &amp; attention. I sent him, for his opinion, a day or two ago, a poem which I have written since I left home -&amp; in the letter which I now enclose you have his opinion upon its merits -From such a man as Mr. Wirt the flattering char- acter he has given of the work, will surely be to you a recommendation in its favor. In the conclusion of the letter you will see that he advises me to "get a personal intro- duction to Mr. Walsh" the editor of the Ame- rican Quarterly Review &amp; get his interest in my favor -that interest, and his highest encomiums on the poem are already obtained as Editor of the Review he promises to notice it which will assure it, if not of popularity, of success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Under these circumstances I have thought it my duty to write to you on the subject. Believing you to be free from prejudice, I think you will aid me, if you see cause; At my time of life there is much in being before the eye of the world -if once noticed I can easily cut out a path to reputation. It can certainly be of no disadvantage as it will not, even for a moment, interfere with other objects which I have in view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am aware of the difficulty of getting a poem published in this country -Mr Wirt &amp; Mr. Walsh have advised me of that -but the difficulty should be no object with a proper aim in view. If M ssrs Carey, Lea, &amp; Carey, should decline publishing (as I have no reason to think they will not. They having inva riably declined it with all our Ame- rican poets) that is upon their own risk the request I have to make is this â€” that you will give me a letter to M essrs Carey, Lea, &amp; Carey saying that if in publishing the poem "Al Aaraaf" they shall incur any loss you will make it good to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The cost of publishing the work, in a style equal to any of our American publications, will at the extent be $100. This then, of course, must be the limit of any loss supposing not a single copy of the work to be sold. It is more than probable that the work will be profitable &amp; that I may gain instead of lose, even in a pecuniary way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would remark in conclusion that I have long given up Byron as a model for which , I think, I deserve some credit. If you will help me in this matter I will be always grateful for your kindness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you conclude upon giving me a trial please enclose me the letter to M essrs Carey, Lea, &amp; Carey -I shall wait anx- iously for your answer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my love to Miss Valentine &amp; all I remain yours affect: E A. Poe</field>
