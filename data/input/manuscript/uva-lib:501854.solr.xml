      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore. Octo: 16 th . 1831 . Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is a long time since I have written to you unless with an application for money or assistance. I am sorry that it is so seldom that I hear from you or even of you — for all communication seems to be at an end, and when I think of the long twenty one years that I have called you father, and you have called me son, I could cry like a child to think that it should all end in this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You know me too well to think me interested — if so: why have I rejected your thousand offers of love and kindness? It is true that when I have been in great extremity, I have always applied to you — for I had no other friend. but it is only at such a time as the present when I can write to you with the consciousness of making no application for assistance, that I dare to open my heart, or speak one word of old affection. When I look back upon the past and think of every thing — of how much you tried to do for me — of your forebearance and your genersoity , in spite of the most flagrant ingratitude on my part, I can not help thinking you myself the greatest fool in</field>
      <field name="fulltext">existence, I am ready to curse the day when I was born.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I am fully — truly conscious that all these better feelings have come too late . I am not the damned villain even to ask you to restore me to the twentieth part of those affections which I have so deservedly lost, and I am resigned to whatever fate is alotted me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I write merely because I am by myself and have been thinking over old times, and my only friends, until my heart is full— At such a time the conversation of new acquaintance is like ice, and I prefer writing to you altho' I know that you care nothing about me, and perhaps will not even read my letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have nothing more to say — and this time no favour to ask. Altho I am wretchedly poor, I have managed to get clear of the difficulty I spoke of in my last, and am out of debt , at any rate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May God bless you — EAP . Will you not write one word to me?</field>
