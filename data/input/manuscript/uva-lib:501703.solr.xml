      <field name="fulltext">Near New Market Apr. 14 th [1] My Dear Aunt,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We received a letter from home yesterday one from aunt Clem and one from Bet [2] , so we had quite a reading, we had looked for them for several days before they came to hand. The one from home was quite a family one the, kind I like only wish they would come a little oftener, was glad to hear you were all as well as usual. There is no news in camp of importance, the enemy are still quiet &amp; I hope they will stay so until we get our army better organized, they are reported to have a large force between 20 &amp; 25 thousand but I think that is too large for if they had that number they would not have any difficulty in march ing right on to Staunton , but I think they are afraid of Jackson , I wish he could get a sufficient force to drive them back for it will never do for them to get possession of this rich &amp; beautiful valley there is sill a great deal of corn out in the fields yet which we ought to have for will ne e d it after while. We are still at Parson Rude's 5 miles below New Market on the fine Steinberger Farm . I tell you it is the finest farm I ever saw the land nearly as level as a floor. We have two houses to stay in &amp; plenty to eat so you see we are getting along finely. [3] I do not know what our force is not more than 6 or 8 thou sand . I am afraid we will have to fall back farther. Our compa ny was filled up yesterday with the Rockbridge Malitia 52 in number they are very nice men Charly McClung [4] is among the number a very pleasant man we scraped up kin but I do not know how much, I expect he is all you know any thing about, we had an election of officers this morning which resulted in the election of Hue White Captain Strickler First Lieut , Sam Lile 2nd &amp; James Culton 3d one of the malitia [5] I think they will make very good officers but I am in hopes by June we will have our Captain back by that time [6] if all reports are true about the late fight in Mississippi but I am afraid there is some mistake about it I have no doubt we get a great many prisoners but I don't like the thought of falling back again and I regret the loss of Gen Johnson for I think he was an excellent officer, we get no papers and cannot get the particulars but I am in hopes we have defeated them badly though our loss is very heavy now is the time for the South to act if we delay, now we are gone but I will never give up as long as there is a ray of hope, I don't believe there is any chance for them to whip us. We are both very well. I like the service very well though it is right hard but I think every one that can go ought to. Give my respect to aunt Elvira and to every body write soon for it takes letters so long to come. love to you and all the rest.</field>
