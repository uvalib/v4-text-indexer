      <field name="fulltext">I embrace the first oppertunity I have to write you to apease you of my perfect safety. You have heard of the great battle of the 9 th and must be anxious to learn of my fate. I escaped without a scratch, and am grateful to God for his mercy. I knew when I wrote you last that when an engagement should seem that we should be sent to the front. but I could not tell you, for I knew you would suffer so much on my account. Now that the battle is over, the rebels in full retreat and only 104 104 men left in the noble old 7 th I can tell you. Gen. Pope said he wanted Tyler's Brigade (now Geary's) in the front “to set an example to the eastern troops” and nobly has the example been set.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our Regt went into the fight 290 strong, &amp; came out with 104. went in with 32 and came out with 18. Malcolm Eckinshead , Calvert Miller, Wm McClung and Bryson xxx were killed Charley Brooks, xxx XXXXXXXXXX xxxx (14) were wounded.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps I own my safety to Col. xxx and Lieut.- xxx . after I had fired about 12 rounds, they came to me and ordered me to xxx off the Col's. horse ( xx xxx ) which was wounded. I did not want to go, but the Col. said he could not trust the horse with a wounded man, and that I must go, so I came off the field unhurt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot bear to give you the details in this letter but will in my next. George XXX was slightly hurt in the head, but not dangerously</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved two letters from you on the 11th which I will answer tonight or tomorrow. Until now I could not get a piece of paper, or any other stationary,. or I would have written sooner. XXX recieved a letter from xxx . I have written her, and she has recieved it. But we have orders to move on so I must close for a while. Our Brigade is xxx in xxx , and will not have to take the front again. and I think we will not have to fight for a long time again at least I hope not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me to Dora. Has she xxx my letter?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May God help you and preserve you is the prayer of your devoted Charley I send you a little xxx I recieved from xxx this evening, which will tell you how bad as xxx hurt, They have moved the xxx of our Co Lo xxx so I have not seem them. I send you a few xxx from the Baltimore xxx .</field>
