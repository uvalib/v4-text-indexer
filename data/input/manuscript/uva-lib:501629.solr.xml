      <field name="fulltext">Carthage, Tenn. March 21/63 My Dear Friend:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your favor of March 10th was duly received and I wrote an answer and mailed it day=before yesterday, but I have just learned that the mail was captured by the Guerillas between here &amp; Gallatin , so I will have it to do all over again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So you have committed matrimony, have you? Or were you only joking? If you really have "gone and done it" allow me to con= gratulate you on your choice and to wish you and your bride a happy voyage together down the stream of life, together with the "little res= ponsibilities" . I am sorry however to lose you from among the noble fraternity of Batchelors . I fear that the joys and cures of matri= mony may induce you to for= get your friends who have not yet joined the Bene= dictine order.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The fact is I intend to take me an helpmeat myself from among Pennsylvania's fair daughters, some day— p-e-r-h-a-p-s . With this view I expect you to spread a good word for me to all the "genuine fenders" and it may be I can find some one fool enough to have me.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I quite agree with you in regard to the wish you ex= press in regard to that hold= ing affair.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since I last wrote to you we have "changed our base" to the north side of the Cumber= land river as it was getting quite unhealthy on the other side. A forage train of 18 six-mule teams was captured on the 6 th together with the escort of 62 men from our regiment was captured on the 6th, and hardly a night passed without some of our pickets being shot. Since we crossed we have not been troubled in that way. Four of our boats were fired in= to yesterday 7 miles below here and two men wound= ed . Our gun-boat shelled the town ( Rome ) and the ad= jacent roads and quite a num ber of the rebs were killed.— The town was nearly burned to the ground. We are every day expecting an attack from Gen' l Bragg , who has lately been heavily reinforced. We are also expecting reinforcements.— The small pox has made its appearance here in some of our regiments. Otherwise the health is good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is about all the local news. With the generally news you are better acquainted, I pre= sume, than I am.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weather is quite fine and ploughing and gardening is the order of the day among the citizens. In that respect I presume they are about three weeks ahead of you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Our regiment was to=day furnished with bran new Norfolk Rifles (Springfield pattern) I am quite proud of mine, which I call "Katie Darling" and I am anxious to draw a bead on a rebel with it. I intend to sleep with it to=night .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my respects to your lady and all the friends, and write soon</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours Truly D.R.P. Shoemaker Co. "E" 11th Reg. O.V.I. H. A.Bitner Esq.</field>
