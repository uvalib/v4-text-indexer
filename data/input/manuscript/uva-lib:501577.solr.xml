      <field name="fulltext">Camp Keys 7 th O.V. Romney Va. Jan 9 th 62 Darling Sister :-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last night, I had the pleasure of recieving your kind and interesting letter of the 1 st , and you may be sure I was highly entertain- [ed How very kind of you to remem ber me, and to take a sisterly interest in my wellbeing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Darling sister !" What emotions the writing of that word caus- [es in my heart! It seems so strange to feel that after so long a time as has elapsed since her whom I onlce loved to address by the lov endearing name of "sister" has deigned to write to me. I can say at last "I have a sister , " yet more than sister. Heaven help me , that I may be worthy of your love as a brother ought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must banish these unhappy thoughts from my mind, else I shall go distrated Forgive my, dear Addie for this expression of feeling. I will try and be more cheerful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There is now, here, about four inches of snow , and of course, there must be more up north. You must be now enjoying the pleasures incident to the coming of Old King Winter Well, be happy and joyous, Addie darling, and take my share of the pleasure. But there are pleasures in war, too , not that it is a pleasure to kill, burn, and destroy, far from it , but as Ferrold used to say " there is no employment in life, but has its moments of pleasure, " even a grave digger has his pleasure. There are men whose graves I would love to dig ." I force myself to enjoy the pleasures of Camp, but little do the boys know the feelings which pass within.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Have you the reports of the skirmish at Blew's Gap? The fighting men of the different Regts. here were ordered toward Winchester, and at half past 7 of the 7 th inst. they arrived at the Gap. 16 miles from here, where the rebels were entrenched, about 1000 strong. (The 114 th Va. Militia) and after a few rounds, they broke &amp; run, with a loss of 9 killed 3 or 4 wounded, 13 prisoners, 3 cannon 10 horses, 2 wagons, all their camp equipage, commissary stores and a large number of guns, and a quantity of ammunition. Our loss was nothing. Hal &amp; myself did not go , owing to the fact that we were on Picket guard. I would not have missed going for a good deal Perhaps I may go next time. We are prepared for an attack here at any time, all our extra baggage being sent to Cumberland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thank you, Addie darling, for your prayers on my behalf. I love to think that there is one at least who can remember me before the throne of mercy. "God in heaven, preserve you from harm, and shower the choicest blessings of Heaven upon you" Addie, dear is my earnest prayer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps I may come home in a few days if I can get permission of the Major.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close this uninteres ting letter hoping to recieve another letter from you soon. Hal is well as ever. Give my kind regards to Laurie. Be happy, and kindly remember the poor soldier.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Trust me. I remain yours forever and affectionalely Charlie Capt Wood has not yet arrived here nor has he sent your letter, nor Hal's. Hal is not reduced in rank but is now 1 st Lieut.</field>
