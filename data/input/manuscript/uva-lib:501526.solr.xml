      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Feb. 23 rd /'62</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A welcome letter was there dearest brought by fridays's mail It had been long and earnestly looked for by anxious and, sometime tearful eyes, I could not refrain from thinking, pretty loud , Heart! welcome messenger of love, when it was handed, me I must tell you how or rather what a joyful disappointment, it produced</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The donation. that I spoke of in my last "came off". Laurie went over in the afternoon and I waited till evening. The first place that I went was to the office, which is under the Hall. where the donation was held. I inquired if there was any mail for me. None, replied the postmaster I presume I looked -- guess how "Oh: you must not put on such a 'solemncholy' face, replied he Well dear Charlie, I had to put forth all the resolutions which I was capable of, to keep back the tears, presently Laurie came down stairs with our stretched hand and guess I presumed , dont you</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest, I am stealing these few moments, but I could not help it we have company here passing the sabbath. The "George family" consisting of Mr. George and wife, and two daughters have been giving some grand vocal concerts here in Mecca, and the young ladies are staying with us. They are sweet little s girls. Misses Jess . or Jessey and Mollie. Jesse is a petite little thing, about four feet high and very near my. Mollie is younger, Oh Charlie, if you could but hear them sing, It raises me up. away off. I dont know where Jesse sang, 'The Union Forever, for me" 1 last night. The folds of their magnificent flag fell as graceful over her little form. as you could wish. They sang 'The Sword of Bunker Hill" 2 also, I had heard of it sung before but never with such thrilling sweetness Hal says I am a perfect enthusiast when I hear music 3 . but who could help having this enthusiasm rise, while listening to sweet music</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must not let the "George family" fill up my letter. Dearest what a history you gave of yourself in your last. It was as unexpected as it was strange and sorrowfull. I know that I never have spoken to you about it and what is more I never would unless you introduced the subject I felt no anxiety what ever in regard to your past life. I had given you my confidence first as a friend. I next tried to give it as a sister, but luckily or unluckily or not. the future will tell, - failed. and now I give it to you as a true pure hearted and youthful maiden would give to a noble pure and high minded man, I give it you now as a sacred gift not scrupulously. but freely &amp; with out a doubt. I surely can not rejoice in your sorrow dearest and yet I sometimes am glad that you tasted its bitterness It seems as if one could sympathis in an others sorrows more earnestly when they themselves have drunk the draughts . but how selfish I am. Forgive me darling for such thoughts</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am sorry that Col. Tyler is so much disliked in his Regt. It must be very unpleasant for him to remain when he has not the confidence of his men I am so sorry that that ugly little quarrel arose between</field>
      <field name="fulltext">the Col, and Hallie but I can not help it. If I had been with you when you wrote of your becoming a commissioned officer I presume I should have responded ha, ha, ha! Thanks you dear one for your "sketchey' gift I can best thank you ? but hope to see the time when I can show my gratitude in a more beneficial way, Hallie was looking at your portrait a little while ago and wishing you were here. He said you would be a very welcome visitor &amp; he would feel as if you came</field>
      <field name="fulltext">4 came expressly to see him that is if some one else were not here giving a sly look at one</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The girls laughed (for I am right in the room with them Jess would not let me go out) and they looked at me too Presume I blushed for Hal. said "Dont you wish Charlie was here to see the roses" naughty boy is he not? that is some times. How ambitious you are dear Charlie, I fear I would rather remain dormant than trust to chances in a battle but our natures are different in that respect</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I can write but little more as Mollie says she will be compelled to go to sleep if I do not stop writing Wonder if it is so dull with out me. " Dont I feel flattered " Write often very often dearest to cheer your Addie Please excuse this writing and composition For Charlie</field>
