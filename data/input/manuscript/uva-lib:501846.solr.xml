      <field name="fulltext">Balt Oct 30, 1829. Dear Pa -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your letter this evening and am grieved that I can give you no positive evidence of my industry &amp; zeal as regards the appt. at W. Point: unless you will write to Mr. Eaton himself who well remembers me &amp; the earnest tones of my afflication . But you are labouring under a mistake which I beg you to correct by reference to all my former letters — I stated that Mr. Eaton told me that an appt. could be obtained by Sep r : provided there were a sufficient number rejected at the June examination &amp; regretted that I had not made an earlier application — that at all events with the strong recommendations I had brought that I should have an appt. at the next term which is in June next — So far from having any doubts of my appt. at that time, I am as certain of obtaining it as I am of being alive —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you find this statement to be in correct then condemn me -otherwise acquit me of any intention to practise upon your good nature — which I now feel myself to be above—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is my intention upon the receipt of your letter to go again to Washington &amp;, thō contrary to the usual practice, I will get Mr. Eaton to give me my letter of appt. now -it will consist of an order to repair to W. P. in June for examination &amp;c — &amp; forward it to you that all doubts may be removed- I will tell him why I want it at present &amp; I think he will give it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would have sent you the M.S. of my Poems long ago for your approval, but since I have collected them they have been continually in the hands of some person or another &amp; I have not had them in my own possession since Carey &amp; Lea took them. I will send them to you at the first opportunity— I am sorry that your letters to me have still with them a tone of anger as if my former errors were not forgiven -if I know how to regain your affection God knows I would do any thing I could.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am Yours affectionately Edgard A. Poe</field>
