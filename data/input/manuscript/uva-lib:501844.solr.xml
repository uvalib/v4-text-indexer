      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore June 25, 1829 Dear Pa,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wrote you on the 10 th of June in reply to yours of the 8 th in which I urged my reasons in further support of my request to be allowed to publish a poem — &amp; I did intend, but forgot to say in conclusion, that as I had submitted the question of its being expedient to your decision — I should by no means publish it without your appro- -bation — I say this now, because I fear from your silence that I have offended you in pressing my request any farther.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The poem is now in the hands of Carey, Lea &amp; Carey and I am only waiting for your an- -swer to withdraw it or not — It was my wish immediately upon receiving your letter to return home thro' Washington &amp; ascertain the fate of my application — of which I am induced to think has succeeded — as there were, I understand several rejected —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This I will do immediately upon learning from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In whatever errors I may have been led into, I would beg you to judge me im -partially &amp; to believe that I have acted from the single motive of trying to do something for myself — &amp; with your assistance I trust I may — I have left untried no efforts to enter at W. Point &amp; if I fail I can give you evidence that it is no fault of mine — but I hope to succeed —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am afraid you will think that I am trying to impose on your good nature &amp; would not except under pe- -culiar circumstances have applied to you for any more money — but it is only a letter that I now want.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will explain the matter clearly —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A cousin of my own (Edward Mosher) robbed me at Beltzhoover's Hotel while I was asleep in the same room with him of all the money I had with me (about 46 $) of which I recovered $ 10 — by searching his pockets the ensuing night, when he acknow- -ledged the theft — I have been endea- vouring in vain to obtain the balance from him — he says he has not got it &amp; begs me not to expose him — &amp; for his wife's sake I will not. I have a letter from him referring to the subject, which I will show you on arriving in Richmond.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been moderate in my expences &amp; $ 50 of the money which you sent me I applied in paying a debt contracted at Old Point for my substitute, for which I gave my note — the money necessary if L t Howard had not gone on furlough would have been only 12 $ as a bounty — but when he &amp; Col. House left I had to scuffle for myself — I paid $ 25 — &amp; gave my note for $ 50 — in all 75 $.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since I have been in Baltimore I have learnt something concerning my descent which would have, I am afraid, no very favourable effect if known to the War Dep t viz.: that I am the grandson of General Benedict Arnold — but this there will be no necessity of telling —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my best love to all my friends — I hope you will give me a favourable answer concerning my poem tho' I will strictly abide by your decision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am your affect ly E. A. Poe</field>
