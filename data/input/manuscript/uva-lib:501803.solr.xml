      <field name="fulltext">Wayland , Aug. 14th, 1868 Mr. Purvis, Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your letter, and I thank you for it. It is grati- -fying to know that my efforts are appreciated by a gentleman for whom I entertain such sincere respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In these days of novel-reading, I thought a Romance would take more hold of the public mind, than the most elaborate arguments; and having fought against Slavery, till the monster is legally dead, I was desirous to do what I could to undermine Prejudice. You say, "The Demon of Prejudice was never more cruel and relentless than now." I grant that it often exhibits more ferocity than ever, but I think that is merely angry resistance to a change that is seen to be inevitable. The colored people, being better protected by the laws, venture to take their rights more boldly, than they formerly did; and that also tends to the increase of wrath. But notwithstanding these rude manifestations on the surface, a salutary change is really going on. When I compare the state of things with what it was when I was young, the change seems to me wonderful. Another half century will see changes still more wonderful. It is strange that anything so irrational as prejudice should be so difficult to eradicate. Consider what contempt and cruel outrages the Jews suffered for nearly two thousand years. No amount of virtue, or learning, or wealth, could protect them from treatment as contemptous as was ever bestowed on the most abject slave They had no security for life or property, and were subject to cruel outrages and tortures whenever the rabble took the whim. And how utterly absurd, as well as wicked, was this prejudice! for not one Jew in a million had ever heard of Jesus at the time he was crucified by a faction at Jerusa- -lem.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As well might all Christen- -dom be considered responsible for the murder of Joe Smith, when only a small fraction of them ever even heard of it. Yet, to this day, Jews are described and persecuted in many European countries; nor have we Americans quite outgrown this unjust and narrow prejudice. But the world does grow; and the time will come when all classes will find their natural level, as freely as the waters do. I have tried to help on this good work, according to the measure of my ability; and sad as I sometimes am over the present state of public affairs, still, on the whole , I feel encouraged. Whether my faith and hope would survive the restoration of the Democratic Party to power, is more than I can say. They would doubtless reverse all the laws in favor of the freed- -men; but if worst comes to worst, it will last only for a time. Meanwhile all we can do is to work for the right with might and main.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Child unites with me in sincere respect and cordial good wishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very truly your friend, L. M. Child</field>
