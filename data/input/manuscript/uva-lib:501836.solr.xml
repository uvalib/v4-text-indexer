      <field name="fulltext">Griswold left a note for me at the office, the other day, requesting me to furnish him with some memoranda of your life; and it will, of course, give me great pleasure to do so; but, upon sitting down to the task, I find that neither myself, nor Mrs Clemm , upon whom I mainly depend for infor. mation , can give all the necessary points with sufficient pre- cision for G's purpose. Just send me a line, therefore, answering the following queries, and I will put your responses into shape. Most of the points we know , but not with full certainty. What is your father's Christian name? Had your parents more children than yourself, Lewis, Frances, Susan, Martha, Isabella &amp; Jackson ? -if so, what were their names? When &amp; where were you born? With whom did you study law? What was (exactly) the cause of your lameness? How did you first become known to the literary world? Who were your most intimate associates in Baltimore ? When did you remove to Cincinnati ? With what papers have you been occasionally connected -if with any? Be- sides answering these queries -give me a list of your writings published &amp; unpublished -and some memoranda respecting your late lectures at Washington . Reply as soon as possible, as the volume is in press.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I understand that Dow has a paper in Alexandria - how does he get on with it?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am still jogging on in the same old way, and will probably remain with Graham , even if I start the "Penn" in January . Our success ( Graham 's I mean) is astonishing -we shall print 20,000 copies shortly. When he bought Burton out, the joint circulation was only 5000. I have had some excellent offers respecting the "Penn" and it is more than probable that it will go on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How do you get on yourself? I have been expecting a letter from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours truly &amp; constantly - Edgar A Poe.</field>
