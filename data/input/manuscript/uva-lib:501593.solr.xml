      <field name="fulltext">Camp Tyler, Va. April 9th 1862 My Precious Addie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps I am placing myself in a position liable to censure, in apply- ing endearing terms to you - but when I say "My precious Addie," I feel it from the depth of my heart. Used as I have always been, to being repelled and scorned by those who should have loved , to have the assurance that there is one who loves me, it is not at all strange that I should be some- what "outr√©" in my "addresses". Had it been otherwise with me, I might perhaps be a little more reserved in my expressions, but I feel that my Addie will pardon this seeming break of etiquette.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, after that long apology, you will expect something comme il faut , as the French say. Whether all I write is as it should be, or not remains to be seen. I am very sorry you suffer so much on my account. You are correct in supposing that I should not withhold any thing from you, nor have I. Had I been seriously injured, I should have informed you. My arm was not fractured, at least I do not think it was, and it is very nearly well as ever. It was caused by a spent ball or a fragment of a shell striking my arm just above the elbow, and for the time depriving me of the use of it. It might have been worse . Do not think that I would conceal anything from you, my own, I am not schooled in the art of deception .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another thing which gives me great uneasiness is, that you do not receive all of my letters. I have not allowed more than a week to pass without writing to you, and yet you did not receive any for nearly three weeks ! I know you must anx- iously watch the mail. -Laura tells me so- It is really too bad.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weather is horrid - still God sends it and "He doeth all things well." For the past two or three days, it has snowed and hailed incessantly. But weather beaten as we are, we do not mind it. To be sure, we feel some ennui , but if we have papers - which by the bye are rather scarce - we manage to while away the time. Do you see that great drop of water there? How provoking that it should come right down upon my paper! I tried to prevent it, but could not. Excuse it, will you not my love?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask my advice about your teaching school this coming summer, Why Addie? I could not have been more surprised, had you asked me if you could not eat your breakfast. Do you imagine that I wish to control your actions? I do not love to control . Far from it, dearest. You must do just as you see fit, just as though I had never seen you. Teaching is a pleasant employment, but it has its pains, also; I taught three terms, and if my expe- rience is like everyone's, or rather if they are all like mine, they found the bitter with the sweet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not think that I wish to dissuade you from it. Have you asked Hal's advice, and your papa's? Trust their advice sooner than me, for you know they are older and more experienced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must not allow your faith in the great and good God to waver for a moment, for you know, "whom He loveth He chastenith ." "He is ever faithful, ever sure," if it is his will that I should come home soon, won't we be happy?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I believe Ed. Williams 1 was uninjured in the late battle. I am not personally acquainted with him, but often hear Will speak of him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close as it is nearly night. Tell your papa that he has my kind regards, and give my respects to all. You and Laurie must write often and rest assured that I will write as often as possible. Did I mention in mine of the 6th that I sent a picture of crop lanes? May Heavens blessings be thine, dear Addie, is the prayer of your Charlie. P.S. I received a letter from Hallie yesterday and will answer it this evening.</field>
