      <field name="fulltext">Philad. Nov. 21. 1806 My dear friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I should deserve to be entirely discarded from your good opinion if I did not take an early opportunity of replying to your last kind letter just received. I sincerely hope you will not allow a negligence which is constitution al &amp; impartial which has lately found some excuse in the pressure of a good deal of business, to exclude me from your friendship. I will not promise to do better for the future, because the strongest resolutions are sometimes unavail =ing , &amp; promises unexecuted are only covert insults.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not recollect to have objected to the title of your luc r ubrations. The latin word Adversaria , though I see no etymological reason for it, has been always applied to the use which you have made of it. A certain Dutch Latinist who once attempted to find good Roman words for all the terms Spheazes used among merchants employed with great propriety, the term Adversaria for a Ledger; matters of account being there arranged, as we all know, in opposition to each other My Library is not rich enough to contain the Lexicographic treasury of Henry Stephens, but I suppose old Lagun did not overlook it when he was raking his learned heap there I did find it. together &amp; I'll look for it there. I cannot imagine where else you, my friend , chanced to light upon it. There are few, even among Erudites themselves, who look to any more ancient or more trustworthy guide thro the labyrinths of Greek &amp; Latin than Lehrevelius &amp; Ainsworth. I, indeed, having neither of these, am obliged to rely, for my Latin, on an old worm eaten dictionary of Latin, Greek &amp; English of the seventeenth century completed by one Thomas Holyoke, or, as he himself translates his name, Thomas de Sacra Quercu , alias Holiokeus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You mention that a number of the mag. was still due at Baltimore I believe the delay has arisen from want of paper, at any rate, this no fault of the editors.— This is a good opportunity for telling you that the magazine is going to be metamorphosed, from a monthly, to a semiannual affair. Whether it will lose by this change, or gain, in any other respect than in intrinsic value I cannot foresee. Conrad thinks it will benefit, as to vendability , this opinion is sufficient to influence me tho' my labour, especially the labour of reflexion, will be greatly augmented. The work is, as nearly as possible, to take the shape of the British Annual registers, &amp; to consist of the various departments to be found in them. I am just going to prepare a prospectus, which, when published, you will see, of course: permit me to request your sentiments as to the eligibi =lity of this plan. The mag: has now subsisted more than three years: a very long life for an American publication of this kind. It is quite time that it should die, in the order of Nature; of pure old age.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You have reason to say that experience has justified your sticking close to your profession when the first or second year gives you twelve or fifteen hundred dollars. This is a success which not one young man among an hundred can boast of, even after five or seven years of probation. I should sincerely grieve if I were to see your attention even divided by any other object than law, I mean any literary object, for it is in vain to pray against the intrusion of every diverting or seductive phantom without exception There is one phantom from whose visits at your gravest or busiest moments, it is not possible, nor perhaps desirable to guard you. I mean woman. Your age &amp; your constitution of mind will never allow you a moment perfect tranquility or so= ber application till you are married. Your friends Merediths destiny, I see, provokes an Eheu! , but I suspect there is more of envy than of pity in the sigh. When I hear you are married I shall rejoice. When I have discovered what kind of wife you have got, my joy may be converted into grief, or it may be raised into higher joy; but that you are married is, so far, good news This subject always reminds me of an old ditty of my own inditing in my versifying days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Marry wisdom, and beauty &amp; wealth if you can But marry at any rate, that's the best plan. Let the girl be no widow, nor wanton nor shrew But all are far better than no girl for you— If your parents say yes, where your fancy says nay Never haggle, but let the old folks have their way— If you spurn at sixteen &amp; take sixty you're mad But take Sixty, if sixty alone can be had. A wife is the fount of all good or all evil She's an angel to bless, or to curse you a devil, Her bosom's a coffer overflowing with treasure Of woes without end, or of Joys without measure; Yet no man, till married, can tell, for his life, Whether heaven or hell be his lot in a wife: Whether nectar shall lave him or Brimstone shall burn, Till he passes the gulf which allows no return: Her dust may prove gold, or her gold may prove dust, But take her, my good boy, for take her you must—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will probably think the council as poor as the terms in which it is conveyed;— but, seriously, &amp; in plain prose, I assure you that I shall be extremely glad of an opportunity to wish you joy of a wife. You'll never be at ease, nor settle down into a good thorough going lawyer till you have one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Adieu C.B.B.</field>
