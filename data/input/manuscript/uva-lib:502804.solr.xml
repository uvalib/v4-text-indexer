Our Company reorganized to day for the War; our Commissioned officers are as follows, Capt. Jas. W Newton, Lieut Chas. W Grills 2nd Lt Churgus Grills &amp; 2nd 2 David F Eachord. We have a very large Com . I hope that our Army may soon be able to give the enimy a death blow. I suppose you have hurd all the perticulars of the battle of the 23 I was in six feet of Gray when he fell he was shot in the head and never mooved after he was shot. Lieut Willson was some three our four yards behind me. I miss him a grate deal he always was a grate friend of mine he was a brave and honorable man &amp; died fighting for his liberty, evry thing looks gloomy at presant but the soldiers seem willing and ready to fight them at any time that we may be ordered to wurds them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The enimy are in Edingburg six miles below Mt Jackson. The Malitia look like thay are already whipt all thay think about is running .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Samuel Lightner has Volenteered in our Com he has some resemblance of his late Bro J.P. Our Regt. numbers near eight hundred it will not take a very larg draft to fill it out up. I would like very much to come home for a week or two but thare is no chance for furloughs at presant . Your Brothers are both well I think Jacob likes camp life very well. Nothing more at preasent write soon.</field>
