      <field name="fulltext">Dear Friend Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is not Addie rather dilatory about writing to her absent but never forgotten friend? If you knew how busy she had been you would not wonder. We have been bereft of a kind and dear old uncle during the week and I have just returned from his funeral You doubtless, while in NC heard of “Old Squire Sperry” as he was called We feel his loss most deeply but still we could not wish to prolong his stay and see him suffer as he has during the past month</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a dreary dismal day this is The S snow has fell, almost unceasingly all day It is the first that we have had and it comes so driving as if old winter's anger was roused at the delay and wished [n]to throw it's vengeance on the innocent and recding fall. And then you know how aggravating it is when we are imagining sleigh-rides and kissing parties (redicolous) and all “su g ch good things” to have the snow melt as fast as it comes. But let us change the discourse</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What do you think of the supersession of General Fremont I think it a shame to this Government I think Fremont will demand an investigation I hope so at least I think he is better capable of the affair than Hunter although the latter may be a prudent man</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I almost envy you your situation if you have but one correspondent for I have so many that I often neglect them And Charlie is neglected the least of any I always take pleasure in writing to you more so than any other of my correspondents except Kallie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a foolish request you made in your last letter, for me to burn your letter Why dear Charlie you did not mean it did you. I did not comply If you could see the little box with Charlies letters in it stowed away in one corner of my trunk you would not wish me to leave a vacant place. But it is so dark I can not see the lines</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie, I see that I have made some ludicrous blunders trying to write when I could not see, but I will take it for granted that you have excused them and drop the subject</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie, perhaps Addie is not quite as deficient in the knowlede of Military language as you may imagine, although I confess my ignorance in that respect to a great extent still I flatter myself that I know more about it now than I did one year ago</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My little wife (Dora I mean) is up in Cole-brook to her sisters I was up there and made her a visit last saturday and staid until monday. she intends remain in g (I can not spell) there during the winter I shall be very lonesome with out her merry laugh I always feel better when I am with her And you must excuse me if I do wrong but I let her blue eye peep into your letters some times</field>
      <field name="fulltext">She must see some passages at least How is your health now dear Charlie You must be very careful and prudent in regard to your health for if I should learn that you were ill I should so {underline} long to be with you and supply your wants and you know that it would not be very convenient if you was way down in Charleston Is Camp Warren located as beautifully as Camp Dennison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I attended a musical concert a few evenings ago. You know that I am a great lover of music therefore it is needless for me to tell how much I enjoyed it. I have learned a new piece of music entitled "Mother dear O! pray for me" I think it grand. Would that you were here I would play it for you. Do you not like the title If you can make out this long lingo I will call you an uncommon smart "Sojor boy"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Good Bye lingers but I must give it Please write soon to your "Ohio Sister" Addie "Heavens choisest blessings be thine dear Charlie" involuntarily escapes from the lips of Addie</field>
