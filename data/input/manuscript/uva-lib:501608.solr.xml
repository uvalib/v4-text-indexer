      <field name="fulltext">Pro. Marshal's Office, Nov. 25, 1862 . My own loved Addie —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Does my chirography look familiar to you? or has it been so long since you had the pleasure of seeing a specimen that you fail? But I have just recieved two darling letters from you dated Nov. 9th &amp; 16th, in both of which you complain of not recieving a letter from “Charley” for two-three weeks. I do not wonder that you begin to feel alarmed about him, but calm your fears my love, I am neither dead nor changed, &amp; I am enjoying better health than I have for three weeks past, and am steadily gaining, so that I think there is no immediate danger of my demise nor consignment to the Hospital.— I must apologize for not writing within the past week as I promised to do.— We have changed the Pro Marshal, and with the change came a great deal of work for “us four clerks”, and we have had to keep hard at work from dawn of day until half past ten at night. Thus you see but very little time for letter writing remained for us . Will you not pardon me under the circumstances?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is now ten at night, and the rain is falling heavily— as it comes dashing down upon the pavement, the sound awakens many thoughts which might otherwise lie in the deep recesses of the mind. No doubt but it snows heavily upon the “Lake shore” , and you will soon enjoy all the joyous pleasures of “Sleigh-riding.” Would I could be with you. Darling—how much—Oh! how much I wish to see you, to fold thee to my heart and gaze into those loving eyes—the windows of thy noble soul—to hear thy gentle voice as it in accents full of love and tenderness, thou sayest I love you. But the plash of the rain falls upon my ear and I am “far away.”—the pleasure is denied me. and I still toil on—a soldier in the good cause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addie —what would you say if I were to accept a discharge from the Army, and should come home? Would you say yes , or would you prefer that I should remain in the “Noble 7th” until it comes home to Cleveland with in the “honors of war”, and as one of the 1040 who who left Cleveland “for the war”? Is it a funny question? But what do you say? Perhaps I might get discharged, if I should desire it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yes, I would have given much to have been present at Laurie 's wedding. God grant she may be happy. Let us hope she may yet love as she lives, and the past may be forgotten.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You committed no act calling my pardon in reading my note to Hal , and as to the “question” as you will imagine, I have long since made up my mind. The time for enlisting has passed, and I am yet a volunteer. Your information regarding Hal 's going to Mich. was the first I had recieved . I thought it some- what strange that I recieved no tidings from him, but I hope soon to recieve a letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Gen. McClellan has been removed I do not think his career is thus briefly ended. The patient resignation and alacrity to obey even such an unpleasant order, manifested by him has gone very far to win himself many friends. It is true that he sometimes was apparently inactive but when a move was made, it was well made and, as you rema k rked Isnt -that-pretty? , had it not been for the politicians, he would have silenced all slanderers by success, where they by their treason defeated them him. I do not think Gen. Burnside has been as “active” as many prophesied nor do I think he will be soon, in point of fact it is a difficult matter to move a body of men as large as the Army of the Potomac , much more so than a few thousand such as “Stonewall Jackson 's” army. a nd people will find it so. But at all events, “Success to Gen. Burnside .”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it is getting quite late, and yet it rains. We will have muddy roads tomorrow Oh! do tell me all about Thanksgiving-dinner and all. How I would enjoy a piece of mince or pumpkin pie, but I must content myself with "Hard-tack, etc."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must now close for tonight. Good night, love, pleasant dreams be thine, and happiness. Write soon to your own loving and true Charley . Direct. to Care of Pro. Marshal— Harper's Ferry, Va. Please excuse the blots, on this, My love to all.</field>
