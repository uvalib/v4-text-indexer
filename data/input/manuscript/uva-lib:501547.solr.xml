      <field name="fulltext">HOLYOKE CO. 1 East Claridon . July 31 st A.D. 1862 My darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I have allowed so long a time to pass without writing to you I thought it would be very appropriate to write on the last day of the month. Shall I beg pardon dearest, or not? My only excuse for not writing sooner is that I have had no t time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How has the [unclear] month of July been spent by you dear. More useful than by me I trust, Just one continual round of visiting, accompanied my vacation, but I could not feel contented. I longed so much for the time to come when I could again call my little "flock" around me and, in my feeble way impart useful knowledge to their young hearts, I feel much happiness when I know that I am useful, than while away. certainly I spent many pleasant hours "amongst friends at home," but not such pleasant ones as in my school room. I commence my school again Monday</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I attended the "Aid Society" at E. Claridon yesterday for the first time. How happy the ladies seem while engaged in their noble cause, and well they may be happy. Busy fingers were flying, until five o'clock when - the Pres' t being absent - the Secretary. (M rs Ailsworth) called "the house" to order. The Sec't and Treasurer gave their reports, we then listened to two letters from a member of the forty- second. and closed after a prayer by Mrs Ames, had ascended to that Higher Throne in behalf of those brave and true ones who had gone to defend our loved land. I enjoyed myself these if any one did,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie what do you think of the movements at Richmond . Are you not fearful that we 'l will shall be defeated. I know not why it is but I have more con- fidence in Pope's ability to conquer Richmond with his handful of men than in McClellan, with his vast army. McClellan is fast losing the confidence of the citizens of Ohio . They seem to be watching Pope with an eager anxious eye, as much as to say "there lies our hope." Are you not fearful that England will interfere? Many are the hearts that are breathing waiting for the result at Richmond fearing that if our troops are defeated there England with all her hosts will be upon us. Charlie if England does interfere, she will find many of the patriotic ladies of America willing and ready to "shoulder arms." I could never stay at home while our friends and brothers were falling by the hand of a foreign foe never, Wonder if I could not be as brave as Joan of Arc.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your gift by the kindness of Capt, Wood. I was very thankful for it, you must hurry and come home (guess you will hurry ) and tell me how you captured it as you promised me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie why do you not write to Laurie. She has not rec'd a letter from you for a long long time or at least had not when I left Mecca , I do not doubt but that your time for writing is very limited or you would write oftener to me over two weeks has elapsed since I heard from you. But I promised not to scold you. did I not dear? But I should love "ever so much" to receive letters as often as I did last winter and spring. Your photograph is here darling, also your ambrotype. I love to look at the latter dearest, because it reminds me so much of the pleasant and happy hours I spent in your society. It also reminds me of Charlie as he was when I first gave him my young love and at the former I gaze fondly fervently comparing it with the Charlie , the darling noble minded hero of my dreams Shall aught ever dispel those happy dreams dearest? No, they are not dreams darling they are realities.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would that I could be with you dear and be a sharer of the sufferings you endure, but I have wished that often enough to realize that it is useless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not heard from Hallie for some time, the last he wrote, he was very anxious to take the filed and wished to go to Richmond . He is still acting as provost marshall over Cumberland .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I trust he will not be required to go there. Perhaps I do wrong in wishing him not to go but when I consult my own feelings I can not help it. Dora is waiting for me to go down with her and I must close write very often darling. and may Angels guard thee for Addie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me to Sergt. Moore, Will Breden Charlie Brooks, and "all the rest" Addie Dora sends love</field>
