      <field name="fulltext">Oil Spring Seminary, Sept 26, /61 Dear Friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After waiting long and anxiously I at last recieved your kind letter dated Sept. 16 Indeed I was surprised when I recieved it for I had almost dispaired the hope of hearing from you again. and having heard since you left Camp Dennison I thing that you must have felt somewhat relieved when you found yourself down the . You must have felt freed to some extent. I think that I should enjoy a ride on that , with it guarded by some of the gallant seventh. You spoke of your feelings during the fight of as being indescribable Perhaps they were similar to mine when I first heard of the fight Not knowing who were safe and who were not and also hearing that that idolized brother had passed into the cold hands of death you will not wonder that my feelings were sad and voluntarily turned to Charlie wondering if he too had entered that narrow void. It was then I again felt that strange sensation mingled with pity that I wrote you of when I first became acquainted with you I was then I really longed to hear from you but did not have the pleasure till last eve You wrote of sending a letter after recieving mine which I did not recieve Perhaps I will yet but do not think so Charlie I wish I could collect my scattered thoughts enough to write something worthy your perusal. but that seems impossible I wrote a letter to Hallie a few days ago including a few lines to you do you know whether he recieved it or not I sincerely hope you did. I read of the fight in which Col. Lowe fell. Noble man he died a cruel yet noble death It seems, when I realize the privations of. war, cruel for our (for our) brave youths to fall on the battle field with no kind friend to sooth and comfort them. But I would not sadden your thoughts. If you were here would we not have a nice ring? We miss Hal very much when we round the old while away the hours in music. He would never give us any peace till we would play and sing with him. Charlie I have a sweet little friend here in Mecca If it were not for her I would be very lonesome indeed. We are almost constantly together her name is Dora Leslie I wish you were acquainted with her. She is gentle and kind and still she is as perfect a piece of female vanity as I ever became acquainted with. [W or Sh]e attends the same school the same lesson and occupy the same seat. In fact some have intimated that our friendship was more for the sake of her brother and Hal than for each other (Ridicalous) If Hal knew who told me so he would laugh some. I saw Edwin Williams about two weeks ago. he said when I wrote to Hal to send word to Will. Braden that he was well and would like to see him. He wish very much to go to war again but does not health will permit him to do so. Charlie what a quiet day this is This morning it was warm and the sun was shining so beautifully but now hardly clouds have gathered together and completely obscured the sun. a slow drizzling rain is falling as if nature was shedding a few silent tears that the summer is ended and the cold winter is fast approaching. When the rain is falling in torrents I always turn my thoughts to the soldiers wondering when and how they are I do you if you will be obliged to camp out this winter Charlie you know not how many silent petitions have been sent to that high throne for your safety and darling Hallie's I sometimes wonder why life is so strange and why I am to this dull routine of life You may think that I have strange feelings indeed I have at times I know not for what I live. Do I do any good in the world? I fear not But what am I writing My thoughts have been way down south in Ole Virginny with Hal to day more than usual, and I scarcely know what I write Charlie are you fasting to day Dora to ask you she says tell him Addie and I are on green apples But I guess you will be tired when you have finished this nonsense give my love to Hallie and Please write soon and oblige me</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Affectionately, Addie Case I am again to tender my thanks for the sketch of you sent me. I prize it very highly</field>
