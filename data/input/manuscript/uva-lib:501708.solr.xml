      <field name="fulltext">Camp Winder [1] Feb 20th 1863 Dear Emmett</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your letter was received yesterday evening. I had mailed one to you in the morning. I have had very little opportunity to make the inquiries you wish. I have been on road detail to day (making corduroy road to Guinney's [2] ) and have to go again to morrow , so you see it will be impossible to go to Guinney Station before Monday, if indeed I can go then. I suppose you were led to believe, that large profits could be made on skillets from having heard us speak of having to pay 12 or 15 dollars for one. If you could get that price, it would pay very well, but I do not think you could get it; unless you could get them to the different brigades of the army and sell them there, in which case, I think they would bring 12 dols' . The sutlers [3] of regiments do not buy them at all, so far as I can hear, unless they get orders for them. As for the Sutlers at the Station, I can not speak positively, but think they act in the same way. The day you went up, McKee [4] failed to get one, but got the promise of one soon, if he would leave 10 dols , his name etc, which he would not do. However I am of the opinion that you might sell them there for 8 dollars apiece , in lots of 20, or 30, and it might be as many as 60. I think there would be no risk in you staying a few days, at the Station. But you know there is no accomodation there, and no place to keep them. I got the box that night. It was a treat, I tell you, but you will know that after the sight of it. The coffee is delicious. McKee got his furlough next day and started in about an hour. John D. got his too, and went Monday. I want you to send me a tin plate by him. If you buy skillets, you ought to do it at once while the army is lying quiet. A good many soldiers have been courtmartialed in the brigade. Several were publicly whipped today, and four others . Haven't heard the sentences of the Killians [5] .</field>
