      <field name="fulltext">Camp Tyler near Paw paw, Tunnel Feby 23 rd 1862 Mine own loved Addie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now that you are here before me, can we not have a few moments quiet " tete a tete ," all by our selves? How does my darling Addie manage to pass away the weary monotonous hours which seem to lag merely to annoy us? In singing, sleighing, and having "good times" I suppose. I think I never saw time pass as wearily, as it does here. It is a joyous time when the mail comes in, and plenty of letters come for us. but then my day does not come more than once a week. &amp; sometimes it passes over without my getting any. How glad I was, when Cap Asper gave me your letter yesterday, I can not tell you. You may imagine my surprise, and gratification on percieving that it contained your miniature. I can only thank you now, and hope that I may come home soon and repay you better. But it is not one quarter as pretty as the original, but it serves to assure me that you love me, and I ought to be very grateful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How I wish you could converse with me, but fate has ordained that I should be a "sojer boy" and furloughs cant be obtained always when they are wanted. But I shall not be always attached to the U.S. Army, and three years will soon pass away, then I shall be free once more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well Addie, I must tell you of yesterday. Great preparations were made at the order of " Major Gen Tyler " (as Creighton calls him) day before yesterday to celebrate Washington's Birthday. Arches of evergreen were erected. Flag poles raised were raised, and tents were wreathed &amp; decorated in a tasteful manner, and every thing was arranged in tip top order. At 11 A.M. yesterday, the Brigade consisting of the 7 th &amp; 29 th O. 110 th Pa. 7 th Ind. &amp;1 st Va. Regts was drawn up in line, near our camp and were reviewed by Col. Buckley of the 29 th , then by Gen. Lander in person. Gen. Lander says the 7 th is the best Regt. in his department. Quite a compliment was it not? He made us a short speech after the Review, in which he promised us soon a "forward movement."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What do you think our Regt. is com ing to. All of our best officers are resigning and going home. First Chaplain Brown. then Hal. Now Lieut. Kimball of Co. A. &amp; Adjt. DeForrest have resigned &amp; it is reported the Major is about to. &amp; I know Col. Creighton intends to as soon as he can get any pretence. It is too bad, I declare, that a first class Regt. must go to ruin merely because a ruined &amp; unprincipled man is at the head. If some energetic officer would take the affair into his own hands, &amp; profer a list of charges (which could easily be prepared) against Tyler, and not be afraid of losing his own epau lettes , our regt. would be soon rid of the scheming politician &amp; have a man for a leader. But so long as we are tied down by such line officers as Asper Wood, W.R. Sterling &amp; Capt. Crane, who are afraid to assert their own independence for fear that they may lose their glittering shoulder straps &amp; the attendant salary, so long must we be down- trodden: Yet Tyler will cajole &amp; flatter, &amp; promise all sorts of "Laurels," and a few will cheer for the "Gallant Col." He made a short speech yesterday which he intended should be cheered. What must have been his feelings when not a was raised, nor a cheer given for him from the 7 th</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must bring this to a close You must write very often Addie love. just as often as you please. &amp; I will endeavor to return as many letters as you send. if not more . I wrote you a letter the 13 th which you could not have recieved when you wrote. but. my request was granted in one manner. Is it in the other ? I leave it all to you now Addie. darling. will you complete the arrangements</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write very soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember I am Yours forever, Charley P.S. Sergt. Moore sends his respects, also Will Braden. I think he would like to correspond with Laurie if he dared to. Give my kind regards to Dora and love to Sister Laurie. I have not heard from Hallie since the 6 th Inst. A paper has just come for me for which I thank you very much. Charley</field>
