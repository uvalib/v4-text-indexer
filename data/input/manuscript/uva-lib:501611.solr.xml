      <field name="fulltext">Chambersburg June 10th 1861. Dear Henry :—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours of the 22nd ult. was received in due time, but not answered as soon as its demands required, but "better late than never." " so here goes." In my last I spoke of the sight presented in our streets, but since that time things have changed considerably, and the scenes presented in our streets on Friday and Saturday of last week were quite a different aspect reality be stamped on every move. On Friday five companies of Cavalry, the heroes of Sumpter (except Maj. Anderson ), four Regs. of troops, accompanied by their bands and followed by their baggage wagons, which make a peculiar rum- bling noise, this Brigade was six miles long ( Capt. McMullens Philadelphia Rangers were in the crowd.) You may and can only imagine what the effect of such a scene would be, the sight was the most sublime that I ever witnessed, the bands of music with numerous fifes and drums,— the heavy tread of about forty wagons, all conspired to bewilder the undrestanding and render vague all our preconceived ideas of war. The movements of Saturday were not quite so imposing, but for the cavalry it they would have been equally grand. Sabbath approached finding our citizens in a state of uproar &amp; confusion, cars were running an screaming — men were working wagons were moving through our streets from morning till night and citizens were on a continual parade. truly such scenes, such sabbaths, and such times, were never before ours to behold. Uncle Stumbaugh will in my opinion leave very soon, but when I do not know, but think, to night or tomorrow, if you should happen to see any of our folks and it is not to much trouble, you would oblige me by telling them, that if they want to see him that now is the time, Isadore has been confined to bed sick for several days and doesn't seem to improve much, and I fear that he will not be able to go along with his fellow soldiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There were fifty wagons brought up on Saturday night, and by seven O'Clock sunday morning they were all unloaded. I received a letter from D.R.P. Shoemaker on Saturday. I must answer it to day or to-morrow , he is yet at Pleasant Hill and says that if anything would induce him to sholder a musket it would be an invasion of old Franklin . good for him he seems to be a Union man: even to the point of his nose, and so he should be. You seemed to think that some other Nation might join with the South but I believe our cause is a just one, and if, all the other nations of the earth should join with their teeming millions and come to our shores in battle array against us, that by trusting in the god of battles, who I believe is superintending our movements, that triumph must be ours, but we must do our share of the work and stand right up to the mark, whether death be our lot a not Henry , I have no fear of the result, we may lose many good men, but if we go to the work right I feel confident of succes . I am sorry that I have not time to answer your letter fully but if you knew how often I have been called away from my writing I know you would excuse me, there has been about eight person in here bothering me all the time, and no person in the office to be bothered but myself as Messrs. Carlisle &amp; Stewart have not reached yet. if I have time I will try and do better the next time. Give my respects to all inquiring friends if any there be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours very Respectfully Alex. Cressler N.B. Wright soon but come up sooner or I will pull your ears. Ellic.</field>
