      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Dec. 7 th 1861 Dear Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you not think I should be thankful for the long list of letters I have received from Mr. Tenney during the past two months? Have you not written to me? I think I have not been the happy recipient of one letter from my friend Charlie since Capt. Aspen returned to his company. I thought it strange. If Hal had not been with you I should have thought you was ill.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. George Moore was here yesterday. he said you were well. I inquired of all those I know in Co. H. We spoke of you (now don't feel flattered) in very pleasing terms. I showed him the sketch of Weston that you sent me. He pronounced it very natural with the exception of an old log back of the Camp that where Wash. slept one night. He then related the circumstance which, perhaps you know better than myelf. Camp Dennison, he said looked almost like home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, Charlie I had some sport the other evening. James Beebe came here. I was busily reading one of Hal's letters when I heard a rather timid rap on the door. I arose and opened when who should appear but said Beebe. I seated a chair for him and resumed my reading - You know how I detest him - He hemmed a few times took his hat and laid on the floor then drew his chair near the table and took up an ambrotype, which he had seen time after time. But he must do something I presume he felt more like a man with that before him than waiting in awkward silence for me to make a move. But not long did he wait. I arose with “Do you wish to see my father! I will call him.“ And stepped toward the door. “ Ahem Miss Addie,” he stammered out, I turned “I - I thought I'd call and see if you'd let me stay with you a little while” he at last said. I told him - well guess what. At that moment he heard father coming toward the door when he sprang and went out like a deer, leaving me so convulsed with laughter that it was some time after father came in before I could explain to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would that I could describe that mans looks as he sat by the table</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I shall live at my aunt's and attend school at east Mecca this winter and in the spring go to Oberlin. I had thought I should go to O this winter but found I could not prepare myself. I was some what disappointed when I found I could not go. But we have to meet disappointments.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I attended a lecture a few evenings since of one of our missionaries. And it seemed as if I never heard of such a mind as that man possessed The quick thoughts glowing with poetic imagery. the fervid eloquence seemed to lift the hearer to some lofty stand point and I could almost see the far famed luxuriance of Eastern chimes, or behold the vast crowds held in thralldom of debasing errors till my heart glowed to stretch forth my hand to those perishing ones and pluck them as “ brands from the burning”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And thus I compared them with the vast numbers of slaves held in subjugation in my own country. This beautiful America! It was then I prayed that this war might never close sh until our land should be freed from the curse of slavery. The gentleman's name was Rev. Mr. Cooley . As I gazed on that man I thought “How many noble sentiments are cherished in the heart which are never brought to light, because the energy necessary to carry them into effect is wanting. A few untoward circumstances are enough to dampen the zeal and put an end to the finest suggestions.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lieut. Wood is home, I have not seen him as yet but intend to. We have not had much sleighing yet. today seems more like spring than winter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dora is still in Colebrooke . I was up there to see her thursday she said when I wrote to send her “Love sack” but it is so large I can not get it in this letter. Laurie sends love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will write as soon as you receive this wont you dear friend. I get so anxious to hear from you</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My kind regards to those I know Love to Hal Your's in friendship Addie Please tell Hal that Mr. Moore was here and did as he requested</field>
