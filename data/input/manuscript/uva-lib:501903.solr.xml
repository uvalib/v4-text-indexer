      <field name="fulltext">Some day when you find the time do sit down and tell me all about what is being done on the grounds toward restoring the lost place. With my love to your Father and Mother and an abundance for yourself I am</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Most sincerely Randolph Williams</field>
