      <field name="fulltext">Marshall Place July 16 th , 1873. Dear cousin William.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Some time has passed since the reception of your kind letter, and yet it has not been answered. I hope you will forgive me for being so slow this time, as I promise to do better in future.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am sorry to inform you of the death of our dear old Grand -mother. She died the 16 th June exactly one month ago today). We miſs her a great deal, but she suf -fered so much while here, that we looked on her death as being a relief. There was not a day during her last sickneſs that she was'nt suffering all the time unleſs she was under the influence of Morphine. She always spoke of death with calmneſs. Said she was willing to go at any time, but seemed to fear the sting of death. I believe she looked upon it as being something awful, but when it came she met it with perfect calmneſs and gently fell asleep. The day before she died, she said, “ The Saviour has been a support to me in many trials, and he is now my staff.#” She gave every evidence of being a truly pious christian, and remained faithful to the end. God grant that all of us may live to be as useful and good as she was. She had a remarkable mind and remained sensible to the last. We buried her at her old home in the upper end of the county. I wish you and cousin Jane could have seen her before she died but I know you couldn't come so far. Wish cousin Jane had come last winter. Where is she now? Cousin Josie Walker has been staying with us this summer. We are planning to take a trip to the Valley this summer. Think we will certainly go this time. If not it will be a great disappoint to us both. If cousin John comes over in time to make arrange- ments to go with us back we will go about the middle of August or the first of September. I anticipate great pleasure in seeing the Valley and hope my wishes will be realized before long. We are beggining to have vegetables and fruit in abundance. Have had a few peaches, but they were not entirely ripe. We have a good prospect for fruit. The crops are very good. Pa has a large crop of tobacco this year. The rains have been very frequent and very gentle this year, so I hope the droughts have come to an end at last. Tell cousin Kate cousin Joe will write to her very soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much f l ove from us all to her and the children. Tell cousin John of our intentions and send him our love make arrangements Write soon love</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your true cousin Alice M- I hope you will excuse this miserable scrawl. My pen is not a good one.</field>
