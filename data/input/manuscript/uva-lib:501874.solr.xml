      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville, Va. Jan. 24-'96 My dear Mr. Gordon,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I enclose you a letter from McCabe to myself and a copy of my reply thereto. I hope that you will give it a good deal of thought. To my mind it is exceedingly important. I received yours this morning. I am glad to hear the good account that Colonel Cutshaw and Colonel Douglas give of Mr. Whitely; and still with the impression that Thornton and Echols have, it might be dangerous to appoint him. This question of an Inspector is filled with many difficulties. General Craighill advises that we should leave the whole matter to the architect; Green Peyton who you &amp; I trust very much thinks an Inspector would be a mistake; and yet I am perfectly certain that we ought to have somebody in charge of this work on behalf of the University. In fact in any building at the University there should be someone, an officer of the Institution, who would be responsible for it. Suppose Green Peyton were Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds, how much trouble would you and I give ourselves about this matter? Not a bit! So I come to the point. Our Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds who is one of the finest fellows in the world, and a man of splendid intellect, is from habit, character of mind, and training, unfit for his position. He takes no interest in it; never can be found and is not doing his duty. Now I am not writing this with any harshness at all. I am just stating to you what I know to be facts. In addition, the Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds is the proper Inspector of the work that goes on t at the University and if he was the best one in the world, he ought not to hold the dual position of member and servant of the Building Committee. I think, if you all two agree with me, that the solution of this matter is an easy one. I am satisfied that Echols is more than willing to give up the place as Superintendent; that he intends to do so at the end of the session and that he would be glad to do it now. Then it seems to me, that the wisest thing we can do is to select with great care an Inspector and when the Board meets let us then accept Mr. Echols' resignation and I think I can arrange that it will be offered, and let us select an appointee as Inspector Superintendent of Buildings and Grounds. This seems to me to do away with all the objections to the appointment of a special Inspector. Now I myself, would be perfectly willing to take blindly and I don't I often say that, any man that H.D. Whitcomb, Colonel Cutshaw and Colonel Douglas, from a professional stand-point, knowing these facts, would recommend to us. Think this matter over; we cant take Thornton into our confidence about it. In the first place, no man can ever tell when he has an axe to grind for himself and then every thing filters through him to the Faculty and leads to lack of harmony between us. Mr. Davis came to me about the Ott matter today. I want to have a talk to you and McCabe about it when you come over. Please give this matter of Inspector a great deal of thought. I am perfectly satisfied that the master-wheel of this reconstruction machinery is sound; but there is a grating cog in a wheel that will be always worrying us and may bring us to a disgraceful break-down. Mary tells me to say to you, that if you come over on Saturday morning you must bring Margaret with you and let her spend the day with the baby. However, you must come on Friday evening as we must have a long talk.</field>
