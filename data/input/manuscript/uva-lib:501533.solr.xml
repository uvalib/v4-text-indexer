      <field name="fulltext">Mecca, April 13 th 1862. Good morning. dear Charlie..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you not like to converse a short time with Addie this mor- ning? Perhaps I can not be quiet long enough to write much of a letter. for I heard this morning. that Hallie is over to Auntie's and I wish very much to see him. I do not know whether he will come over home or not. I presume I can be more contented when writing to you than any other way.. I do not feel very contented any way to day. the battle of Pittsburg Landing has occupied my thoughts most of the time since thursday. How frightful! I have been reading the particulars of it this morning. and it causes me to tremble. I would so like to know if you are safe to day dear Charley I feel so lonely and sad to day that all manner of thoughts enter my mind. Perhaps it is wrong but I sometimes wish that you were not in the army. but I feel that it is your duty to be there, therefore I will try and be reconciled. I do not wish to discourage you dear one, but my heart sometimes rebels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I dread reading of the future battle of Yorktown , which is daily expected.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie, dear will you grant me one favor? I wish your photograph very much.. A full length one. if you please. (you percieve I am writing just as if I already had the promise of it) Darling will you please send me one when you have a chance Laurie was speaking of it last week and said she wished I had one. so you see I have concluded to ask you for one,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Wallace Coburn of the Seventh Ohio Regt. was buried in Bazetta friday. Poor boy! I think that he was the first Trumbull Co. soldier that has been killed in battle. I have heard of none other.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh Charlie. the “Mecca Youths” are to give a concert at Oildom 1 next wednesday eve. for the benefit of the “Soldier's Aid Society” a noble cause for the children to engage in is it not? I guess you had better come and be my “Chaperon” had you not? I am certain that I should feel highly hon- ored and perhaps proud. Miss Poole and I walked about two miles last eve to attend a singing school, and I have not got rested yet. We went. because we wished to say we had been to one regular singing. school during the year of 1862. Mecca folks are not able to support a singing teacher. therefore we have had no school during the past winter We generally have two or three different teachers and schools during the winter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest. I wish the “blockade” could be run a little oftener so that I could recieve letters oftener than I now do. I never had so few correspondents since I was a “little girl.” as I have this spring For some reason I know not what I have not written to my correspondents &amp; conseque ntly they do not write to me. I will tell you who they (the present ones I mean) ar , My darling Charlie first. Dora next Miss Susie Ross . and “ Lu &amp; Mollie .” Will. Donald son . and Miltie Irwin . are all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie the Miss Braden of whom you spoke in your list of lady friends is her name Libbie Braden ? I am acquainted with Miss Libbie Braden of Gustavus .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling write to me as often as possible will you not? Please remember me to the boys. Tell Geo. Moore . I congratulate him upon his success in the fight at Winchester . Write real often dearest. and may Heaven bless you</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As ever your Addie .. To darling Charlie..</field>
