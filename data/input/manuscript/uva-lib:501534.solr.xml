      <field name="fulltext">Mecca, April. 16 th 1862 Charley , my darling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This day is too pleasant to have work associated with it. Therefore I devote myself to something more congenial, which some- thing , always is a pleasant pastime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have just returned from Uncle's, while coming home. I gathered these little flowers. Spring lovely ornaments. They are the first I have seen, and Charlie must have them. Remem ber, they are Mecca flowers. Undoubtedly they will have faded, ere you recieve them. but think that while they lie before me now, they are beautiful. A small token, perhaps you will think, many do. But to me they are worth more than jewels.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My "dark eyed sister" was at home a few minutes this morning. She says I am to recieve a letter from you to day . I trust that I shall, for more than a week has passed since hearing from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, why do you not "go into raptures" over the beauty of such a day as this. As I sit here before the open window, listening to the little warblers and occasionally glancing at the budding trees, I can not help exclaim ing wonderful! beautiful! Although I have heard birds sing just as sweet and have seen the budding of trees, many many times before, yet to day there seems to be something more than sweetness mingled with their songs. They seem to tell me what a blessed thing is life and what a noble thing it is to live . How different are my thoughts to day from what they are sometimes. At times I feel some as " Ham- let " did while meditating after seeing his father's ghost. that for "that dread of some- thing after Death," I too would not wish to live. but to day . how different. now I would cling to life firmly. Life seems grand to day , and blessed. Indeed I think I am blessed. Yes, dearest blessed with your love. and what more could I ask.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hallie came home Monday. I had a pleasant but short visit with him, darling boy! He says Charlie is one of the best boys that ever drew breath. Such a remark from Hal made me feel proud. do not allow it such liberties with yourself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did I write you of Mr. Beaman 's death? He died of consumption. was buried last Saturday. He was an uncle of Mrs. Newton Shaw . Dear Charlie if you do not come home soon. I fear you will not have a chance to become acquainted with Miss Sadie Heylep for "Junior" says she is soon to be married to Mr. Church By the way Sadie used to admire Hal "pretty much." She invited him to see her last Saturday. he told her that her "meeting house" was in the way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have recieved no answer from you yet in reference to my teaching. They wished to know if I would take the school and I did. I shall commence one week from next monday I think. How I should enjoy a visit from you before then darling. but I expect that happiness is denied me. When you write to me after recieving this please direct East Claridon Geauga Co. Ohio. Dont you think I will make a good school. teacher ? Guess I will. I should be pleased to have Mr. Penny for one of my scholars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How I wish the "blockade" was not quite so effectual. I miss your your dear letters -- pardon me I meant -- "Angel visits" Oh hush! did you say. well. remember me to the "boys" especially to Mr. Penny . and write as often as you can please</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours &amp;c. Addie Beautiful is not this.</field>
