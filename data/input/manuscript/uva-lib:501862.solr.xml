      <field name="fulltext">University May 1826 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I this morning recieved the clothes you sent me, viz an uniform coat, six yards of striped cloth for pantaloons &amp; four pairs of socks — The coat is a beautiful one &amp; fits me exactly — I thought it best not to write 'till I recieved the clothes — or I should have written before this. You have heard no doubt of the disturbances in College Soon after you left here the Grand Jury met and put the students in a terrible fright — so much so that the lectures were unattended — and those whose names were up on the Sheriff's list —travelled off into the woods &amp; mountains — taking their beds and provisions along with them —there were about 50 on the list — so you may suppose the College was very well thinned — this was the first day of the fright the second day, "A proclamation was issued by the faculty forbidding "any students under pain of a major punishment to leave his dormitory between the hours of 8 &amp; 10 A M — (at which time the Sheriffs would be about) or in any way to resist the lawful authority of the Sheriffs"— This order however was very little attended to — as the fear of the Faculty could not counterbalance that of the Grand Jury — most of the "indicted" ran off a second time into the woods and upon an examination the next morning by the Fa- culty — Some were reprimanded —some suspended and one expelled— James Albert Clark from Manchester . (I went to school with him at Barke's) was suspended for two months. Armstead Carter from this neighbourhood, for the remainder of the session — And Thomas Barclay for ever— There have been several fights since you were here— One between Turner Dixon and Blow from Nor- folk excited more interest than any I have seen, for a common fight is so trifling an occurrence that no notice is taken of it — Blow got much the advantage in the scuffle — but Dixon posted him in very indecent terms— upon which the whole Norfolk party rose in arms — &amp; nothing was talked off for a week, but Dixon's charge &amp; Blow's explanation — every pillar in the University was white with scratched paper — Dixon made an a physical attack upon Arthur Smith one of Blow's Norfolk friends — and a "very fine fellow". he struck him with a large stone on one side of his head — whereupon Smith drew a pistol (which are all the fashion here) and had it not miss- fire — would have put an end to the controversy. but so it was— it did miss fire — and the matter has since been more peaceably setled — as the Proctor engaged a Magistrate to bind the whole forces on both sides — over to the peace — Give my love to Ma &amp; Miss Nancy -&amp; all my friends —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain Yours affectionly Edgar Will you be so good as to send me a copy of the Historiae of Tacitus — it is a small volume -also some more soap.</field>
