      <field name="fulltext">Oildom March 12 th '62 My Darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can wait no longer for a letter from you . but must continue to keep you my debter .. I must ask you dear one the same question which you asked me in the winter Have I offended you the reason that you do not write? Almost two weeks have fled since I recieved your last "angel visit .. " Do you know how sad and lonely I feel when such a long time passes with out hearing from you? Darling, please write often .. I should love to recieve letters from you daily ..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How muddy the roads are here now . the frost is all out of the ground . but the roads have not as yet got settled You was here last spring when the roads broke up . think of the roads then and now . but they are not quite so bad now as they were then .. I am with Dora today and have been since day before yesterday .. I intended going home yesterday, but it was so bad going that I did not go. Dora says I shall not go till sunday. How odd she does look, here, attending to her domestic duties. Wish you could see her you would laugh .. I did not think last fall . that she could ever become contented and sober enough to "keep house" but I was mistaken. If you could see her commanding her Regt. of pots and kettles . you would be almost tempted to ask her to show you her diploma.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going home again to live. our school closed two weeks ago to- morrow. Hallie has not been home for a good while I wish very much to see him . but do not expect to at present. Hal. intended renting a house in Warren and having Laura and I live with him . and I was going to school . but he could get no house hence we were dis- appointed. Laurie and I would have gone to Oberlin if we had not expected to go [unclear] to Warren. Oh . well . it only served to show us that we were doomed to disappointment in this life .. I do not feel very well this week. I have a severe cold and my throat troubles me some in consequence . but shall be [unclear] better in a few days . I trust . It is nothing serious . so do not be alarmed dearest. How is your health dear one. It has been so long since I have heard from you that I fear you are ill .. You would certainly inform me if you was not well . would you not Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh I attended a school exhibition tuesday afternoon here at the corners They has as good a paper as I ever heard read. Sarah Logan was editress. One piece entitled "fifty- years ahead." was excellent .. I guess old Mecca can boast of at least one genius ..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest Charlie I must beg of you to excuse this poor apology for a letter for I have a violent head ache. I should not have written to day but duty commanded me to. Please write immediately my darling and recieve the blessing of your</field>
