      <field name="heading_text">ALS 4 pp. Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles Tenney</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addie apologizes for not responding sooner to Charlie's previous two letters. She has read in the newspaper that Gen. McClellan is not granting furloughs and Addie is disappointed in not being able to see him. Charlie had sent her poetry, presumatively love poetry. Addie writes that she always wishes that she could be a poetess and that she sees poetry everwhere in life and nature. Finally, Addie comes to the main point of her letter. She claims that she sees Charlie only as a brother, not a lover. She is conflicted over her feelings, hurting Charlie, and the impact on family and friends. Laurie (Addie's brother) has been playing a song, "Heart be still" in the background, and it has Addie's emotions riled up. Addie hopes that Charlie does not take her letter badly for she does not wish to hurt him. She points out that loving him as a brother places him in the highest esteem, and that it is not an empty and cold declaration. Laurie finishes his music and wishes Addie to go with him to a prayer meeting, so Addie closes the letter praying that a guardian angel watch over Charlie.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Mecca January 26 th 1862 My Dear Brother</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurie is writing to Hal and wishes to know if I will send a line to “my brother” I, of course, gladly accept the offer. I received two dear letters from you last week and neglected to answer both till now, and consequently shall answer both in this one, First I must tell you of what I read in the paper, which caused unforbidden tears to flow; I read that Gen. McClellan had forbidden any more furloughs being granted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now, dear Charles, do you blaim me for weeping at that; when my anticipations had been so hightened? I certainly could not help it although father told me that I was “such a foolish little girl” But this is not answering Charlie's welcome letter, Indeed dear brother I felt somewhat flattered on the reciept of your poetry; How often I have wished that I was a poetess, It is one of the wildest dreams that I ever experienced the thought of being a poetess, But as Laurie would say, “cut it short” and tell the truth “you don't know enough, ” Well, dear brother, even I have begun to believe it Poetry is--I am tempted to say--my life. I can imagine poetry in every breeze of wind that fans my cheek, in every ripple of the merry brook, in every melodious song of the pretty warbler, and most of all and sweeter, yes far sweeter than all these, is poetry in the accent of love and friend ship. but when I strive to place it in rhyme, my imagination seems to fly</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But now comes this, “Read this last, please” My brother . how many, many happy thoughts have clustered round that substitute for Charlie, you dear Charlie would wish to dispel those thoughts- would you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You may say I may hold in in a happier nearer and dearer relation. but my friend the translation from a brother to a love is no common affair. I have taught my heart to love you only as a sister and have tried to have my love returned only as a brother. Charlie, I will confess that I could love you with the true and fervent passion of which my heart is capable, but Charlie the dark and dreadful disgrace resting upon our family! I am sensible to the fact that there should be no blame attached to me. But darling brother you are to pure to unite yourself with one whom the world looks upon in such a light, or rather darkness . I may be too sensitive. I some times feel that I am, but my darling Charlie had I known of the facts I now do, I could never never consented to corresponded with you. I am thankful very thankful for to Hallie for telling you. My heart and conscience often reproved me for not telling you myself, but I could not. My God! I would exclaim. I could not tell him if it even to save this nation! Was that a strong expression, my brother! My brother, what feelings arise upon the writing of that word when I know it is not sin. My darling I will not call you by that ould I may by name, but as my own heart says. My own s darling Charlie which I feel to be true .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What am I writing, dear Charlie. Will you blush for Addie when you read these the sentiment of my heart. I fear you will, but Laurie was playing and singing one of my favorite pieces entitled “Heart be still” and it called out all the deeper feelings of my rebellious heart and seemed to work opposite from its usual course for my heart would not “ be still ” dear Charlie will you throw this from you in anger and say “she is nothing but a silly romantic school girl” Will you dear Charlie; If I knew you would I would not send it, but my darling, it is an ill tale but my hand has moved over if never before in unison with my heart and feelings</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling Charlie do you not think there is poetry on this page? I know there is in my heart But fie! what an expression I have written near the top of this page drawing the inference that the name of brother is cold. Bless me! did I forget my own darling brother Hallie No a brother's name is not cold but a tumult of a different nature swept over me at that moment. Than fortune Laurie has stopped playing or I should again go off into one of my wild dreams that is my nature when I hear music, I either sit spell bound or else the inmost depth of my soul are awakened, but</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must close this as Laurie wishing one to go to prayer meeting tonight with him May a guardian angel from Heaven hover round thee, forever as the earnest prayer of your Addie</field>
