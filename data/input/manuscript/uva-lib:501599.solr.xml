      <field name="fulltext">In line of battle, 2 miles above Rockville, Md. Sept. 9 th , 1862 My darling Addie :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your very short, but withal kind letter of Aug. 18 th , I recieved yesterday, and although there is no certainty of a chance to send it, I will reply to it today. You will forgive me for writing on so poor quality of paper, when I tell you that mine is all with the company wagon, and this sheet is all I could obtain out here in the woods. You will wonder why I do not oftener write to you and what can induce me to remain silent for so long a time, I wrote you a letter a few days since, but could not send it until a day before yes= terday. —In it, I gave you a very hasty sketch of what we had been doing for the two or three weeks previous, and said "when we could remain 24 hours in a place, I had much to write you. Although we have remained in our present position for nearly forty eight hours, we know not how soon we may move three, ten or twenty miles, but I will do all I can in the interim. My health (notwithstanding the constant exposure) remains in excellent condition, which I consider somewhat remarkable, as the officers who are much better cared for than the men, and very many of the men are suffering from Colds. summer complaints, &amp;c. Perhaps it is owing to your prayers, and your wish for me to care for my health.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think I will give you a resume of my daily routine. My first work after roll-call, is to prepare my breakfast, consisting of a cup of coffee— some fried meat and crackers — and a dish of stewed apples or peaches. (both are very plenty here.) After B. until noon, I read papers etc. then comes dinner of Coffee &amp; crackers.—then reading, and making entries im my journal until night, then prepare supper. [ vide Breakfast.] Thus you will see that time must necessarily lag, and pass wearily by. Occasionally, we can get up a spirited and lively "confab" relating to the topics of the day, in which Generals have to pass a rigid criticism, not always favorable; but then, our opinions do not make any visible alteration in the conduct of the war.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just now, Pope and McDowell are receiving a generous share of anathemas and invectives, while McClillan is idolized. Speaking of generals, I am tempted to treat you to a little scandal about our division general— Green . When Gens. Augur &amp; Geary were wounded at Cedar Mountain , Brig. Gen. Green was next in rank, so assumed command of the division Since which, by his too familiar manners, and the supercilious way he treats officers in the Ohio regiments, he has rendered himself completely obnoxious, and whenever he makes his appearance, he is met with "Here comes Greeney!" "Hurrah for our green general!" —and the like. A couple of conundrums are going the rounds.— "Why is the 2 d division the bore of the army?" "Because it is Augur 's." "Why is it now very unpopular?" "Because it has a green commander." Green has a son who is one of his aidecamps , He is a very verdant looking fellow, and he evidently adores his mustache which is scarcely perceptible, but he is more popular than his father. Latterly, Green has acquired the cognomen of "Night hawk," pecause he moves us so much after night,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very likely, your curiosity is aroused to know why we are in line of battle here so long, instead of being in camp. Rumer has it that the rebels are in force in front of us, but we form the center line - or reser reserve, and we wait a demonstration upon our front. I hardly think they will make a push this way, though I learn they have taken Frederick I have heard also that the rebels have made a crossing into Ohio , and committed several daring depredations. But then, it is but rumer and lacks confirmation. I wish you could hear the rumors of the army for one day. you would say it was the most incongruous map of infor= mation you ever heard in your life. I pay no attention to the body of them, as it would cause me too much uneasiness , and I do not like to be disturbed with fears of the "near approach of the enemy," and such like apprehensions. for it is inconvenient enough to endure trouble when it does come, without borrowing any unecessary trouble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I saw an article in a late Cleveland Leader , from W.W.H. McCardy in which he condemns the removal of Gen. Tyler from the command of the 3 d Brigade, and the assignment of Gen. Geary to the same, with the addition of the 28 th Pa. Regt. , thus forming the 1 st Brigade of the 2 d division. He also charges Geary with destroying pooperty , and incontinently flying when there was no enemy within 20 miles. This is false. He did not authorize the destruction of the property, nor was it done with his knowledge, neither did he retreat in disorder, He simply obeyed the order from Washington to fall back to Manassas , &amp; he did it with his command in excellent order. It was the 104 th N.Y. who burned the guns tents &amp;c then retreated in confusion, and they belonged to Duryea 's brigade. I say, (and it will be borne out by the testimony of the leading generals — Banks , Augur Pope &amp;c. &amp;c. —) that no better Brig. Gen. exists, than John. W. Geary .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been pained to notice the proceedings in the West, and think much more might have been done by Gens. Grant . &amp; Buell , but it is not for me to censure. Are you not fearful that some daring rebel will make a raid up into good old Trumbull Co. ? But I guess the "struggles of the dying confederacy, in its last throes," will hardly reach so far, even though Maryland does suffer, as evidently she must.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I have learned that mail closes at 10.30, and that we move at 11. so I must write fast, as it is now 10. Col. Asper , and Maj. Carne are both sick and Adjt Molyneaux commands the Regt . He is a very agreeable man, and of late, (Singularly enough?) has evinced considerable interest in me To what circumstance of luck. I am indebted for the above, I know not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How does your school prosper? Near its close, are you not? And how and where is Dora ? You have not quarrelled with her, have you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must write me a good long letter next time, will you not, love? If you do not, I may be tempted to administer a light rebuke. Your prayers, my love, are potent, and God is good. Put your trust in him, and he will bring us all in his time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must close now. Believe me, I remain. Your own true and faithful. Charlie . Co. H. 7 th R.O.V.I. 1 st Brigade 2 d Division, Banks ' Corps. Washington D.C.</field>
