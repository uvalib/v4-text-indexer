      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Edgar Allan Poe, Baltimore, to John Allan dated August 10, 1829 Manuscript, Valentine Museum, Richmond, Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore August 10 th 1829. Dear Pa,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received yours this morning which re— leived me from more trouble than you can well imagine—I was afraid that you were offended &amp; although I knew that I had done nothing to deserve your anger, I was in a most uncom -fortable situation—without one cent of money —in a strange place &amp; so quickly engaged in dif- -ficulties after the serious misfortunes which I have just escaped—My grandmother is ex- -tremely poor &amp; ill (paralytic) My aunt Maria if possible still worse &amp; Henry entirely given up to drink &amp; unable to help himself, much less me—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am unwilling to appear obstinate as regards the substitute so will say nothing more concer- -ning it—only remarking that they will no longer enlist men for the residue of another's enlistment as formerly, consequently my substitute was enlisted for 5 years not 3—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I stated in my last letter (to which I refer you) that M r Eaton gave me strong hopes for Sep r at any rate that the app t could be obtained for June next—I can obtain decent board lodging &amp; washing with other expenses of mending &amp;c for 5 &amp; perhaps even for 4 1/2 $ per week— If I obtain the app t by the last of Sep r the am t of expense would be at most $30— If I should be unfortunate &amp; not obtain it until June I will not desire you to allow as much as that per week because by engaging for a longer period at a cheap boarding house I can do with much less—say even 10 even 8 $ pr month—any thing with which you think it possible to exist—I am not so not so anxious of obtaining money from your good nature as of preserving your good will—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am extremely anxious that you should be- -lieve that I have not attempted to impose upon you—I will in the meantime (if you wish it) write you often, but pledge myself to apply for no other assistance than what you shall think proper to allow—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I left behind me in Richmond a small trunk containing books &amp; some letters—will you forward it on to Baltimore to the care of H. W. Bool Jr &amp; if you think I may ask so much perhaps you will put in it for me some few clothes as I am nearly without— Give my love to Miss Valentine —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain Dear Pa Yours affectionately Edgar A. Poe</field>
