      <field name="fulltext">Chambersburg, June 18th 1861. Dear Henry :-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours of the 16th was received in due time, which found me wa iting and also well and hearty with a good appetite. The troops have all left here but one Regiment and that had left too so that our town is coming back to its former quietness. but false reports and rumors are in great abundance, and correct reports are very scarce. but as I enjoyed Saturday evening with its scenes and a mess of strawberries I will commence a description, if I should not get it finished in this letter, look for the balance in the next. so here goes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The boisterous winds of noonday had died away and given place to the gentler zephyrs of a delightful June evening. The intervening clouds, which had emerged in mountain like masses, from the Western horizon had dispelled the scorching rays of that luminary, which was gently sinking in the western sky and all was calm and serene, save the evening notes of a few joyous birds whose carrolls seemed sweetened by the quiet &amp; beauty of the surrounding landscape. indeed nature was gently wrapping herself in her most gorgeous robes of beauty, while the odors of a thousand flowers had filled the air with their sweet perfume. and thus while my mind was straying in unknown channels contempla pleting -ting the magnificence and glory of surrounding nature, a sound from the distance fell upon my ears which by its unrivaled powers for engulfing the mind in paroxyms of unconsciousness, had so enlarged my former concep- tion of instrumental music, that the perpendicular of astonish- ment fell outside the base of consciousness and conse- quently submerged my powers of reason in a "ker splash," how I extricated myself from the strong embrace of that fit of ecstacies , could only be told by a scrutinizing observer, however, when reason again returned I found myself journeying towards that place from whence proceeded those be- witching strains of music, soon I was standing in the su- burbs of a very splendid little city, the appearance of which was quite picturesque of itself, and grotesque when compared with the cities of the country. This modern city is about one-half of a mile in length and about one-eighth of a mile in breadth having a population of about 3,000 inhabitants; the dwellings were of uniform size, the largest being a little more spaceous than the smallest and the smallest being somewhat less in dimensions than the largest, with streets leading along every side of the dwell- ings ; and running either straight or crooked from the one end to the other side so that strangers could amuse themselves by turning as many times as there is differences of direction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The architecture was of the latest style being neither Grecian nor Gothic but a style of necessity. The rooves of which the houses were shingled with canvas, and the end of those that were not round were neatly lapboarded with canvas the rooves of some reached so near the ground that the ground came in contact with the rooves , while with others the rooves came in close conjunction with the earth, but others had a partition wall of about 3 feet in height, this wall being of solid masonry, the material of which was canvass , served to point out the dimensions of the edifice by plainly distin- guishing the outside from the inside of the structure, but I would have you also remember that where the eve of the roof reached the ground, there was no such wall, but in all such cases the roof separated the inside from the outside so that there still remained and inside and outside to every temple. These buildings for convenience could not be surpassed the door being just at the place of entrance and after becoming iniated initiated into the presence of the occupants of the building and wishing to leave, you will always find the door just at the place where you come out entered , and if your company has been burthensome to the inmates of the house, you'll find no difficulty in leaving, Among all the Ancient and Modern cities of the world perhaps none were so well adapted to the in a point of con- venience , to the wants of the aged and infirm, there being but one apartment in each dwelling in which were found all the necessaries for house cookery, with the couch on which to rest the weary head, which was usually placed upon the soft earth, and in the left corner of the room was the clerk's desk at which all the business of the family is transacted, these halls are large and spaceous while one person is occupying them, and small and precious while six or seven, the usual number in a family, where enjoying the luxuries of their table.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fashion was carried to a state of perfection among the inhabitants of this place, our eastern cities may boast of their fashionable ladies and gents, but must not attempt to compete with this city of these latter</field>
