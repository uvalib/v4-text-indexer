      <field name="fulltext">New York, Apl. 15 Dear Folks —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I need not have hurried here so fast, but I didn't know that . All passages had to be se- cured &amp; the Twelve hundred &amp; fifty dollars fare paid in to-day the 15th, for the Holy Land Excursion, &amp; so I had to be here I thought — but the first man I met this morning was the chief of the Alta bureau with a check for $1,250 in his hand &amp; a tele- graphic dispatch from the proprietors of the Alta say- ing "Ship Mark Twain in the Holy Land Pleasure Excursion &amp; pay his passage." So we just went down &amp; attended to the matter. We had to wait awhile, because the chief manager was not in &amp; we did not make our- selves known. A newspaper man came in to get &amp; asked how many names were booked &amp; what notabilities were going, &amp; a fellow (I don't know who he was, but he seemed to be connected with the concern,) said " Lt. Gen. Sher- man , Henry Ward Beecher &amp; Mark Twain are going, &amp; probably Gen. Banks!" I thought that was very good — an exceedingly good joke for a poor ignorant clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When my jolly old Captain came in, we squared accounts &amp; then went down to look at the ship (steamer Quaker City.) She is a right stately looking vessel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My book will probably be in the booksellers' hands in about two weeks. After that I shall lecture. Since I have been gone, the boys have gotten up a "call" on me, signed by about 200 Californians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Don't forget to remember me to Essie, &amp; "Lou" &amp; all the folks at 1312, — &amp; tell my pet, Annie, that I will write her just as soon as the press of business is over. I will write Katie Lampton, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Send letters to Metropolitan Hotel till further instructions.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yrs affctin Sam. Scrap-book my letters in Alta.</field>
