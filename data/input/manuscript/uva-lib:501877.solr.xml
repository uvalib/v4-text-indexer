      <field name="fulltext">My Dear Cousin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must beg a favor of you which I trust you will grant. at March court our little all will be sold for debt. You know how much I am attached to Sally and her children. attached to them because they are the best of slaves. I never knew so faithful and valu able a family of negroes. you have it in your power to pur chase them. if you do so I can leave the country with peace of mind. the first of April we will set out for the North Western territory, a howling Wilderneſs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My Husband will be in Abingdon this week, he told me, he would visit you, his spirits are so low I fear he will not. if you see him, say every thing to cheer him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My Mother is unable to raise the money at present to buy the family I speak of — Harry would I sup pose but his Wife will sell a negro upon the most trivial offence. none can please her.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Martha the oldest of the children is 16 she has been afflicted with St. Vitus's dance 8 winters. in the Spring Summer, and Fall she is perfectly well, Doct. Floyd told me in the commencement of the disease that lime was the only cure, for several winters it has been gradually leaving her, this winter she has been confined only one day of course she will go lower in consequence of it. she does all kinds of work, that is usual about a house. and knits all the Woolen socks and stockings that are worn in the family — Mary is 13 she can sew very well — Madison is 10, a very capable and likely boy. there are three younger ones. Sally will have another in June.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wish My Dear Cousin you would write as soon as you can —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My love to yourself and family</field>
