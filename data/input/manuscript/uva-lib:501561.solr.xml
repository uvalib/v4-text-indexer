      <field name="fulltext">Farmington Dec. 10 th 1862, My own loved Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Will you think me very foolish if I write again so soon? You will not when I tell you the reason.. You remember in my letter written a few days ago I told you I had not heard from you for some time. and in consequence was feeling quite badly, Well darling I am now happy as ever,-aye even more so.. for hope ever cheering whispers to me that I may soon see --who? My Charlie? Yes indeed truly mine Laurie and Pappa how nice pap-pa sounds came to see me yeasterday and brought me your dear letter of the 25 th that was what made me so very happy. Not, dear that I am happy because your health is so impaired that you deem it doubtful about your being able to go on with your regiment (for such dearest I feel to be the case. although you dread so much to tell me) but then you know the thought of once again seeing you the thought of hearing the gently words. "My own Addie" Do you anticipate my wish with regard to your getting discharged? I was so happy I almost forgot to tell you of it. How very kind in you to write to me and ask my advice, but truly darling I do not know how to give it. fearing that I may do wrong, but I will tell you my thoughts, Your health I know is very much impaired. or you would not think of accepting a discharge.. and such being the case, you are not now in a position where it has much of a chance for improvement.. for you are so constantly employed in the office that you certainly have but little time for exc[rcise?], Do not think that I mean the positiong you are now in is worse for your health. that constantly marching camping out e'ct; by no means, but then you know in order enjoy good health you must take a good rigorous exercise every day , and that I fear you can not now do besides the work you are now engaged in must of necessity be very tedious both to the mental and vital organs., Writing .(if I understand you rightly that is your chief employment) is hard work at any time. and how much more so must it be where it is followed day after day, And then love. you as well as Hal have informed me that you are very anxious to pursue your studies, and now is the time if ever. We are both young yet but not many years will we wish to remain as we now are-- we will want to be all to each other, And I am striving to become worthy truly worthy of thee my noble Charlie Were I a true woman I expect I should tell you to remain if possible and defend our country. but love. I can not . the sacrifice is too great.. our separation has been so long and such constant fear and anxiety has been borne so very long I feel as if we both need rest, Will you wonder what has become of my patriotism? It is all here yet. but I feel as if you had done your duty faithfully just as I desired you to do it,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You have my advise dearest. but if you think it not right throw it away. do not be guided by it if you can not consc[?]ensiously do so, I may possibly endure a little longer and trust in God as heretofore. but I have found it very hard,, As I told you before I am so fearful of doing wrong. that I know not how to act,, but darling please. if you can with a feeling of right (and I do not doubt but that you can) accept a discharge, and then fly to old Trumbull- to Farming= ton., Why Charlie just the thought makes me almost go into ecstacies But darling I have written on this subject longer than I have really had time as it is now study hours. but I thought I must write and if possible hasten your coming, but I must not anticipate too much pleasure or I may be disappointed [continues in margins] you ask me all about Thanksgiving. and I guess I did my duty as far as the consumption of "goodies" is concerned. How often I thought of thee darling wishing that you could be a sharer in the sup sumptious feast which was placed before us, But 1 I will particularize when you come home , I have not time now How very strange that you do not hear from Hal., He wrote you before going to Michigan and sent you quite a supply of stamps, (I do not know how many) and he said he shoul[d] write again in a few days, I do not see why you do not reciece them, Darling I have an oppor= tunity of sending this to the office and therefore must quite reluctantly close, word love Come home ever thine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addie Carrie asks if she may be allowed to express a wish that we may soon see you,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good bye dearest Addie Please direct Farmington write</field>
