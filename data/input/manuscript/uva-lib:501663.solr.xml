We have formed a Bible class &amp; meet on sundy &amp; Wednsday nights to recite our lessings I hope it may be carried on and that some good may come o f v 'e it we have a grand theatre in the Regt, carried on by Capt Brown of the Marion Rifles he is a very good performer he is a noble singer. Capt Newton started this morning on ho on furlough he is very lucky in getting home though I do not envy him his good fortune I would have written by the Capt if I ha d ve ha ve d notice in time. as it is I will hafto risk another by mail hoping it may soon reach your hand Well Kate did your cous, Lizzie make you acquainted with all her secreets if so do you know who she is engaged to I will tell you my reasons for asking you this question in my next letter if you answer it I am a thousand times obliged to you for the cheese you sent to me I assure you it was something I never look for I would like to be in a meſs with your brother but the boys would think hard of me for leaving my old meſs I may say we are almost one meſs for when ever one meſs gets a box the other is envited to share its contents but if Lieut Dempster joines the officers meſs I exspect to change well Kate I wasent aware that I had shown so many sines of my we a k neſs on leaving Greenville it goes to show the feebleneſs of mans nature I was very sorry to hear of the pereveme nts of the Harris famlies I hope the al wise God may do unto them as he did unto jobe of old bless thare future years you said you wished you could take our places down hear do you think you could stand out on gard one of theese cold night s and if you could do'nt you thin we wou ld be as unhappy if all the Ladies ware hear and we ware at home you wrote as if you had been trying to get me to change my love for you but alass how could I you are constantly in my thoughts by day and my dreams by night &amp; God forbid that I should ever love another woman I have often thought dear Kate that you never loved me as I did you but found the keys of my heart and took pity on me. It seemes to me that man is one of Gods weakest instruments well Kate I have not entirely quit chew ing tobacco yet I have used one plug since I came back to the company I used to chew two a week I hope I may entirely quit before long; uncle John was wounded at the sharps burg fight in the arm, I exspect he is in buckingham.
