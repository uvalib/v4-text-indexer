      <field name="fulltext">Camp Tyler Va. March 3 d 1862 My dearest Addie:-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Imagine my happy surprise this evening on receiving another delightful missive from your own heart -- in fact another "Angel's visit." Indeed, your letters are happily received, and nothing could give me more pleasure -- except -- avisit to the dear little author</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I just went to the P.O. Box, &amp; took therefrom a letter I wrote last evening, which I enclose with this, thinking I might as well send two in one My health is excellent, Capt Asper yesterday asked me, "Charley, why is it you are always looking so goodnatured?" I replied "I do not know, only it is because I feel well. I consider myself as healthy man as you have." "I guess you are," said he, "for I never know you to be sick." You are not quite correct in regard to our having bad air to breathe, none can have purer, for there is nearly always a current of air passing through camp. It is quite different from a city, I assure you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must give you an account of todays proceedings. At 10 am, our brigade was marched to the late General's 1 headquarters, and the 7 th was the Regt. honored by being the escort of the body to the R.R. "marching in columns of platoons, with reversed arms, and at common time," If you dont know the meaning of that, (but I presume you do ) Hallie will tell you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fourteen Regts of Infantry 2000 Cavalry and several batteries of Artillery, were drawn up in line and all honors due to the deceased Gen. were paid with proper solemnity &amp; form. but we can safely say, without self-praise that the 7 th under noble Will Creighton was the observed of all observers. and we were not vain of the distinction , either.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">No indeed! I did not intend to do you any injustice, nor did I imagine you were jealous. for I well knew there was no cause whatever; I wrote what I did, merely as a pleasantry, not because I really thought so, Oh: yes. Addie, I will suppress any ill-will, with a vengeance , I think there can be no danger whatever, When any one insults Hal, the insult reaches me. &amp; I will resent this one, no, the many,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is not right; nor just for him to tyrannize over any of his officers, and when he does, he injures the regiment. If some one who had the authority, would investigate the matter, and "give the devil his due," I would be in a manner silent; but as the officers are seemingly afraid to assert their own independence , I consider it my duty to myself, and to Hallie, for the services he has done me , as far as lies in my power, to write the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, even though it does come close, I may be wrong, but if I fail to see it so, When a man has done as much for his company. as Hal has for this. a man is a coward, and not worthy the name of friend or brother, if he will refuse to take his part though it does place him in a dangerous place. But I fear nothing. Am I not in the right? Ask Hal if I am not</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I am getting too indignant.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling Addie, I love you dearer than ever, I could not be perfectly happy, until I knew you could love me as I am. I will strive to make you happy Another abrupt question, dearest Addie, - How would you like to change your name, to the one I have? And, if you would, when shall the ceremony take place?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Addie. does your papa know of our " carrying on ?" and is he willing?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close for it is late and past tattoo. Give my love to all and write very often. My heartfelt thanks for your kind letters and my love to yours, Charlie.</field>
