      <field name="fulltext">The Slave trade was prosecuted very successfully whilst I was at Havana. Numbers of fast sailing vessels were constantly fitting out for the coast of Africa &amp; several Cargoes of the horrible merchandize arrived. The slaves were taken out &amp; carried to houses constructed expressly for them what were called the barracoons just without the walls of the city where they are well treated until restored to health &amp; spirits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A public date is then made the terms of which are that the highest bidders have successively a choice amongst the whole Cargo.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">He sent ambassadors by the Brig to the governor to make a representation of the affair &amp; to offer to restore the Merchandize he had seized as soon as his subjects were given up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Spaniards appear to be fond of public spec -tacles &amp; amusements. I saw several religious processions one at Easter when an image of our Saviour was carried laid on a bed was carried thro the streets with a long train of preists &amp; monks after it.
