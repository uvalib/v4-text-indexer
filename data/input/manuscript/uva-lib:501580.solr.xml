      <field name="fulltext">My darling Sister :</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The "furlough boys" have just returned to-night and none were more welcome than John Chaffee, who met me with outstretched hand - but what did it contain but a letter in the wellknown writing of my sister " Miss. Case, Esq. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now have I not reason to thank John? Well, I did thank him, and - fell to devouring eagerly the contents! You ask if Hallie is well yet, He is very nearly well, so much so that he is now in command of the company, Capt Asper obtained leave of absence for a day or two and today he applied for an ex= tention on ground of sickness, and it was granted. He is at Cumberland threatened with a fever. So long as he is unwell, Hallie cannot come home. (,) I would like to see you very much before you go to O-u . but fate seems to have decreed that I shall have the extreme pleasure of remaining in my tented home</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is now, that romance fails to make camp life pleasant. You have no conception of the dreariness I should feel if it were not that I know there is one who anxious anxiously prays for the safety of two whose lives are in the hands of Him who rules the universe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But with Hallie I pass a very pleasant, time but, I hate to go to his tent, lest the boys would think me a favorite.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was sorry to learn your friend, Miss. Herslop was ill. I hope however, to soon learn of her recovery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How would you like to have a description of the members of our mess? I will send you one, if you would like it. I had three or four sketches of scenes around Reomney , nearly finished, when they were abstracted from my portfolio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weather has been so severe that I have I have not been able to make a sketch since I came here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This position, as Gen. Lander says, is a strong one in a mil itary point of view, and the Rebels, should they come this way, will find a hand boy to handle in Lander.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will make a diagram of this position, and enclose it in my next.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My mind is so scattered I can not conscentrate my thoughts upon any one subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The one absorbing thought of my mind is "Addie." and I doubt not but it is well to have such an abject on which to dwell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pardon me for this poorly written, illy composed. letter, and my nest I will try to make more interesting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile believe me, I remain Yours &amp; yours only Charlie N. Tenney Patterson O.R.R. Jan 15th 1852</field>
