      <field name="fulltext">University Septem r 21 st 1826 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The whole college 1 has been put in great consternation by the prospect of an examination— There is to be a general one on the first of December, which will occupy the time of the students till the fifteenth — the time for breaking up — It has not yet been determined whether there will be any diplomas, or doctor's degrees given — but I should hardly think there will be any such thing, as this is only the second year of the institution &amp; in other colleges three and four years are required in order to take a degree — that is, that time is supposed to be necessary — altho they sometimes confer them before — if the applicants are qualified.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tho it will hardly be fair to examine those who have only been here one session, with those who have been here two 2 — and some of whom have come from other colleges — still I suppose I shall have to stand my examination with the rest — I have been studying a great deal in order to be prepared, and dare say I shall come off as well as the rest of them, that is — if I don't get frightened — Perhaps you will have some business up here about that time, and then you can judge for yourself—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">They have nearly finished the Rotunda — The pillars of the Portico are completed and it greatly improves the appearance of the whole — The books are removed into the library University of Virginia Library — and we have a very fine collection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have had a great many fights up here lately — The faculty expelled Wickliffe last night for general bad conduct — but more especially for biting one of the student's arms with whom he was fighting — I saw the whole affair — it took place before my door — Wickliffe was much the stronger but not content with that — after getting the other completely in his power, he began to bite — I saw the arm afterwards — and it was really a serious matter. It was bitten from the shoulder to the elbow — and it is likely that pieces of flesh as large as my hand will be obliged to be cut out. He is from Kentucky — the same one that was in suspension when you were up here some time ago —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my love to Ma and Miss Nancy — I remain yours affectionatly, Edgar A Poe</field>
