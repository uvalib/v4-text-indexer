      <field name="fulltext">East Claridon . September 10 th 1862 My darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although but two days have passed since I since I last wrote you yet and as I have not heard from you for so long a time I am going to give you some more “spoiled paper ” You must not act upon the principle that the longer you neglect writing, the oftener I will write. for it is a poor principle, You do not know how it grieves me when I do not hear from you for so long a time. None but Dora understand the sorrowful disappointed look which I can not supress when day after day the same answer “no letter” reaches me, I can not help at times but feel dejected and despairing, wondering if God does regard the prayer which so often ascends in behalf of that absent loved one, --my idolized Charlie . But I attach no blame to you darling, because I know that you write just as often as you can, so don't think I have forgotten my promise-- to scold you no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie , what will become of our country, It seems as if the rebels were gaining ground every day. I am not entirely discouraged but when we read “ Washington in danger” “Rebels in force in Maryland ” “ Ohio invaded &amp;c.” it is really discouraging. And then to see how the people here receive such news-- with nothing but a remark such as “ Lincoln means to let them whip us” or “Well when we are completely lost our troops will begin to act” never entertaining the idea that they could be of any help. Why Charlie I verily believe that there are men here at the worst who, if they had an opportunity, would surrender themselves to the rebel army with nothing but a remark such as “I expected it” or the like, never dreaming that there is such a thing as resistance in America “Oh! it makes me so angry to meet with some whom I have hitherto conversed with upon the subject of rebellion. They will come up with that indiffer- ent air, which they alone can wear so becomingly and its “W-e-l-l, Miss Case -- don't you think we're getting ready to take a good licking ”? They will drawl it out and speak it so impulsively just because of they know I have always adhered to the fact that our men never will be conquered . I sometimes find it difficult to subdue the wish that I would enjoy seeing them “take the good licking”</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Is not this a lovely morning darling? just warm enough to be comfortable and every thing so silent up here in the woods, All save the crickets crickets are silent as if they had forgotten to be . What an hour for meditation. indeed dearest, I feel more like lounging into one of my dreamy fits, forgetting all the world in that one blissful thought Charlie's true love . What need I of anything save the presence of that dear one to complete my happiness. May you be spared, my own darling, so that I may show you how fondly devotedly your Addie can and does love you, Surely man was never more worthy of my love than my noble true hearted Charlie . But here come my scholars and my dream is disturbed, In a very few days my darling brother will return, I suppose he was mustered out yesterday, then we shall all rejoice. but how much more should I rejoice if Charlie also could come. But it is nearly school time and I must close</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me to the boys, all that I know and so many more as you see fit. God bless thee noble darling Charlie is the hourly prayer of your own Addie</field>
