      <field name="fulltext">School-room August 1862 My darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another day has gone, and has the day benefited me. or I it? I have learn= =ed something I trust. if I am not benefited The little Lissie of whom I have written before I believe gave me a little trouble to day, I "passed a rule" at the commencement of my school. that those who did not pay good attention in their spelling class must go below the one who spelled their word, and to day Lissie missed her turn. The one who spelled her word. she refused to let go above her, I firmly but kindly told her to stand down, she refused and I commanded her telling her I should punish her if she disobeyed, Now I never threaten withoug executing, and I am sorry to say. I was obliged to punish her Perhaps you would have laughed could you have seen your Addie dealing the blows so un= mercifully . but I thought that if in instance I "spared the rod" I would surely "spoil the child" Although the "rod" was nothing but my hand delivering two blows on her head it had the desired effect, As it is the first time one of my scholars have so openly rebelled it troubled me some. Am I not a good [girls?] to tell you of all my troubles? But I am neglect ing my duty I fear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your darling letter of the 26 th I recieved Saturday and have had no time to answer till to day, monday, I was sorry to learn that you had again left again to face the enemy. Are you thoroughly my darling? so that you can endure the fatigue of long marches as well as run: I know that so far you have been blessed doubly blessed with good health. but as a general thing. when[?] disease comes it is harder wh with the healthiest, Do not therefore relinquish one bit of your care in regard to your health. But you will say this is idle tolls[?] for me will you not dear? You may but if you do you know not how anxious I am for you. my own</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I know darlint that we ladies are [June?] noble patriots. and we are proud of it. There is no sacrifice too great for us to make if it our country or the noble defenders of it. You may call us such withuot exerting any yourself to find any flattery Did it know dearest that I had ceased to regard any thing you say as flattery ? I take it all as good sub= stantial truth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One sentence in your etter dearest. I can not read without such a pain in my heart. it is this "My life is nothing, if by its sacrifice. our country can be saved" Charlie. I am calm now. when I say that if that sacrifice must be made. my life also shall be sacrificed. [S or G]o if needs be. lay down your life upon the alter of our country. but mine shall follow. As there is a God in heaven it shall. Do not say I . for I am not. My heart can never say amen your senence unless yours does to I have just written</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest you say I or "we" can help to raise volunteers by politely inviting such as Mr. to serve their country or be considered as traitor, Indeed Charlie I have treated him with so much reserve that I scarcely ever have the opportunity of seeing him The shirt you sent me of the "irish mans " looks rather comical must . "Paddy" meant to have a fresh supply did he not? But it is time for me to go. I had three new scholars to day. I will try and write more in the morning good night my precious Charlie May sweet dreams be thine. D of Addie with you?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good morning loved Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have just come school-room through the rain. and now I sh write a few minutes or at least till my scholars come How did my darling pass the horors of last and I wish peacefully did you not I was very tired last eve but I had such refreshing last that I feel perfectly well now</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a warm day was yesterday. I do not think I have suffered from the head so bad this summer as I did yesterday. but quite a shower came up in the night, and this morning the atmosphere is not so oppressive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie do you not think we have a great many--what should I call them-- chafe patriots in our army? It seems from what I can hear that we have. They manage to get most of the jobs and for the army than fill very imper fectly the orders with inferior articles and sell for the highest price. consequently our soldiers have to endure many needless privations and sufferings which ought to be prevented Those having charge of the are to blame for not preventing it How can men be so inhuman to thus speculate at the [expense?] of the soldiers. [Such?] are worse than the same fate[?] Charlie [1] . what part wil Ireland if England against us, There seems to be a backwardness on the parts of Ireland about migrating to the U. S, and it is strong by suspected[?] that the English authorities are using [their] to prevent it. Does England [believe] she will need all of her fighting men herself? I do not think all of Ireland will for-get the debt of gratitude she far woes to ing the U.S. as to engage with her [now?] war. She certainly hates England as her oppression and loves the stars and stripes as her I recieved a letter from sister Laurie a few days ago she was well but had not heard from you yet. But my scholars are coming and I must close. Write often very often dearest Charlie, to your affectionate and true</field>
