      <field name="fulltext">N. York Feb 21, 1831 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In spite of all my resolution to the con- -trary I am obliged once more to recur to you for assistance—It will however be the last time that I ever trouble any human being—I feel that I am on sick bed from which I never shall get up. I now make an appeal not to your affection because I have lost that but to your sense of justice—I wrote to you for permission to resign—because it was impossible that I could stay—my ear has been too shocking for any description—I am wearing away every day—even if my last sickness had not com- pleted it. I wrote to you as I say for per- mission to resign because without your permission no resignation can be received. My reason for doing so was that I should obtain my mileage am- ounting to $30.35— according to the rules of the in- stitution. in my present circumstance a single dollar is of more importance to me than 10,000 are to you and you deliberately refused to answer my letter —I, as I told you, neglected my duty when I found it impossible to attend to it, and the consequences were inevitable—dismissal. I have been dismissed —when a single line from you would have saved it—The whole aca- demy have interested themselves in my behalf because my only crime was being sick. but it was of no use—I refer you to Col Thayer to the public records, for my standing and repu- tation for talent—but it was all in vain if you had granted me permission to resign—all might have been avoided—I have not strength nor energy left to write half what I feel—you one day or other will feel how you have treated me. I left West Point two days ago and travelling to N. York without a cloak or any other clothing of importance. I have caught a most violent cold and am confined to my bed. I have no money—no friends—I have written to my brother—but he cannot help me—I shall never rise from my bed—besides a most violent cold on my lungs my ear discharges blood and matter continually and my headache is distracting—I hardly know what I am writing—I will write no more—Please send me a little money—quickly—and forget what I said about you—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God bless you— E A Poe do not say a word to my sister. I shall send to the P.O. every day</field>
