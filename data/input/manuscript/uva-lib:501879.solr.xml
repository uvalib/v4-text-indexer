      <field name="fulltext">I send the duplicate of the dft. for 800 m. and the original for 440 m. Please give both to your mamma She will understand Kind regards to Mrs. Sta- pleton Tuesday night 14 April 96 . My dear little Carter,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sent off a long letter to mamma on yesterday. Tonight I hear that her second draft has come and so I shall scratch this note off for you and begin to think that you are really coming home again, when the money for your steamer tickets has to be sent on. I shall surely be glad to see you. The two troubled, sorrow- ful years seem very long and very lone- ly and I wonder now that I could brave a second and a worse one after the unhappy first. Today real dig- ging began for our new buildings. The other contracts are not yet let out and will not be until May. But it makes us all feel more cheerful to have any actual work going on. Jack had a card from Mrs. Stapleton this even- ing announcing her safe arrival at Hamburg. She is with you long since, of course, and you have extracted all her news. I trust she is more cheerful under the German skies and that the climate and life will be good for her. She is fond of music and will enjoy that, I know; and I think she will be glad to be with your mamma and Janet once more. Is it not queer how your mamma's little canary has perked up since he got home? He never sang a note from the day he left the UVa on his journey to Montana. A few days after I got him back I heard him apparently trying his throat, and now he wakes me almost every morning, warbling away as soon as the skies brighten— not so sweetly as of old, but still real singing again. He would be a little buzzard, however, if he did not sing now. The Spring is fairly opening, the air is soft and mild, and the mocking birds are fluting away for dear life. This little fellow is ashamed to be left out of the concert. I shall send your mamma two announcements which will inter- est and amuse her — one of Becnel's graduation as Doc- tor of Medicine at the Tulane (I told her of meeting him there) — the other of Mayberry's marriage to Miss Rhett of Charleston. I think that is doing pretty well for both of our old friends. The Dramatic Club had to postpone their Easter entertainment because of Jennie Randolph's illness. They telegraphed for Lizzie Harrison to take her place and Lizzie is to come; but she will need some time to learn the part and rehearse thoroughly and so the play was put off for two or three weeks. Mary Stuart went off yesterday to Roanoke on a visit and to be for a time under her Uncle Willie's professional care. The poor little child looks badly and I am afraid no doctor can do a great deal for her. Her cheerfulness and high spirit are undaunted however; she is always bright and gay and full of interest in life. Dearest love to all of you from the Doc up to mamma. Write me a line when you can. We are all well, and the various invalids of our community are all doing nicely.</field>
