      <field name="fulltext">Fortress Monroe (Va) December 22 d 1828 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wrote you shortly before leaving Fort Moultrie &amp; am much hurt at receiving no answer. Perhaps my letter has not reached you &amp; under that supposition I will recapitulate its contents. It was chiefly to sollicit your interest in freeing me from the Army of the U.S. in which (as M r . Lay's letter from Lieut Howard informed you) I am at present a soldier. I begged that you would suspend any judgement you might be inclined to form, upon many untoward circumstances, until you heard of me again — &amp; begged you to give my dearest love to Ma &amp; solicit her not to let my wayward disposition wear away the affection she used to have for me. I mentioned that all that was necessary to obtain my discharge from the army was your consent in a letter to Lieut J. Howard , who has heard of you by report, &amp; the high character given you by Mr. Lay ; this being all that I asked at your hands, I was hurt at your declining to answer my letter. Since arriving at Fort Moultrie Lieut Howard has given me an introduction to Col. James House of the 1st Arty to whom I was before personally known only as a soldier of his regiment. He spoke kindly to me. told me that he was personally acquainted with my Grandfather Gen l . Poe [1] , with yourself &amp; family, &amp; reassured me of my immediate discharge upon your consent. It must have been a matter of regret to me, that when those who were strangers took such deep interest in my welfare, that you who called me your son should refuse me even the common civility of answering a letter. If it is your wish to forget that I have been your son I am too proud to remind you of it again. I only beg you to remember that you yourself cherished the cause of my leaving your family. Ambition. If it has not taken the channel you wished it, it is not the less certain of its object. Richmond &amp; the U. States were too narrow a sphere &amp; the world shall be my theatre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I observed in the letter which you have not received — (you would have answered it if you had) you believe me degraded — but do not believe it. There is that within my heart which has no connection with degradation. I can walk among infection &amp; be uncontaminated. There never was any period of my life when my bosom swelled with a deeper satisfaction, of myself &amp; (except in the injury which I may have done to your feelings) — of my conduct — My father do not throw me aside as degraded I will be an honor to your name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my best love to my Ma &amp; to all friends — If you determine to abandon me — here take farewell — Neglected — I will be doubly tious , &amp; the world shall hear of the son whom you have thought unworthy of your notice. But if you let the love you bear me, outweigh the offence which I have given — then write me my father, quickly. My desire is for the present to be freed from the Army — Since I have been in it my character is one that will bear scrutiny &amp; has merited the esteem of my officers — but I have accomplished my own ends — &amp; I wish to be gone — write to Lieut Howard — &amp; to Col: House , desiring my discharge — &amp; above all to myself. Lieut Howard's direction is Lieut J. Howard , For ss . Monroe, Col: House's Col: Jas House — F ss Monroe — my own the same —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My dearest love to Ma &amp; all my friends I am your affectionate son Edgar A Poe</field>
