      <field name="fulltext">Farmington Dec. 8 th 1862 My dear darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a cold winter evening is this, but not cold enough to dirive away warm loving though ts from the heart. But with those same loving thoughts of thee dear one are strange= =ly mingled sad ones. And for several days previous to this. those same sad thoughts those.--I am almost tempted to say uncwelcome forebodings. have lingered about my heart. at times coming[?] in to feel so very depressed in spirit. as to not care whether life or death were near. and at other times the warm tears would gush forth in torrents, and still I would not know for what I wept.. Is it owing the fact that I do not oftener hear from you dearest? I know of nothing else that could cause such feeling in my heart.. I know I am an ungrateful child . but then you know the heart will be human in spite of our efforts to make it appear different at times, Oh. darling. how very much I desire to see you.. How very many long months have passed since "last we met" and God only knos how many more will pass before we shall meet again, And you dear patient Charlie bear this seperation without a murmur.--you way off deprived of the common comforts of life, patiently endure, not only this seperation but toil privation and suffering while I surrounded say all that can make me happy except thy presence dearest, am bitterly complaning against an all wise Providence. who sees fit to seperate us for 1 an indefinate time, Ought I not to be whipped?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yesterday! oh - guess how I spent the day, In reading all all of thy darling letters I told Carrie that if I would not be the reciever of a letter from you I would read old ones. No they are not old darling. your letters can never grow old. any more than our love. Whil [e] reperusing those precious treasures strange but pleasing emotions filled my heart, Although I have read them many times before. yet I never before read them with such happiness cominngling with that same feeling of sad= ness of which I have before written. allow [?] me to recapitulate some of your writings a little. The first-of your letters gave a description of Camp Dennison. then came the several letters written whil [e] you were in W. Virginia. Your trip to Cincinnati the Charleston flood, battle of Cross Lanes Floyds Pursuit and many other interesting facts which you so kindly acquainted me</field>
      <field name="fulltext">with. then your transfer into E. Virginia, and amid all this came the declaration of your love for me. Oh with what rapture did my heart respond to those precious words.. How very happy was I then darling. Can those letters ever grow old to me dearest? No never while life remain [s?] But I wander. Next came those, relating your different adventures whil in the Potomac. then forward move of the "Grand Army." Soon the fight aaat Winchester in which you suffered so cruuelly then the march up the valley of Shenandoah. and all the marches backward and forward. your march to Fredericksburg and back finally your retreeat and so many different relations that it would be almost impossible for me to repeat them all. So I will write no more of this. once again I ask can those letters ever grow old? And once again I repeat. No never!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only listen to Carrie playing on her guitar. She is now playing the Star Spangled banner She has played "Hark I hear an angle sing" "Lorena" Kingdom am a coming" and various others But dearest I have severall lessons to learn yet this evening so you will excuse the short= ness of this will you not? Also the writing for I have been in a hurry. Will you not write very soon love? Pleaaase do. Could you know how very much I wish to hear from you. you certainly would not fail writing as often as once a week. if not oftener God belss thee to aught darling and always</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As ever your own true Addie</field>
