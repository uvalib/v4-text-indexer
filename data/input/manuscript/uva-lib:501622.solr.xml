      <field name="fulltext">As I have just now got off of duty I thought that it was my duty to inform you of some of the proceedings. Friend we left Har- risburg [illeg.] of day at 10 O,clock A.M, and arrived at Baltimore at 6 O,clock in the eve- ning where we were treated with much respect by the citizens The whole Regiment got their supper at the Soldiers relig. asso- ciation ; a place kept up by the citizens of Baltimore for the ben- efit of the soldiers. Our supper consisted of bread boiled ham cheese, and plenty of first rate coffee, but spreads we had none. And we left Balt. at 9 O,clock that night and arrived at Washington City at 1 O,clock the next morning A.M. where we retired for the night we all slept in the soldiers retreat, a building put up for to rest soldiers in the morning we got our breakfast which was bread and a hunk of meat and chocklet with greese swimming on it a half an inch thick. I had a great notion to greese my shoes with it. We spent a Tuesday forenoon in running around through the City and about 10 O,clock we were marched to where we now are. We are in- camped about in the 7 miles south west from Washington . We were marched from the City to camp wells 7 miles with only 2 rests of about 10 minutes each with our knapsacks on our backs and our guns and our haversa cks all together weighing about 50 lbs and we were doublequicked part of the way</field>
