      <field name="fulltext">Mecaa January 1st 1862 Dear brother Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here you sit right before me and now for a good long conversation. I recieved your welcome gift yesterday, I can assure you that it was a very acceptable Christmas gift. I can thank you much better when I see you than now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was awakened last night at twelve o'clock by the church bell giving notice that the “Old years” last moments had passed and the New year had stepped into existence. Dear Charlie, you can can not conceive my thoughts as I listened to the sound of that old church bell reverberating in the stillness of the night I thought can it be that this loved country our own country must commence another year with the clash of arms and the cries and groans of the downtrodden resounding through the land? I would that this land could have commenced the year of 1862 in peace and true Liberty but it was otherwise willed</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear brother I sometimes tremble and entertain vague prortentions for your safty. But a feeble effort so made to commend you to Him who alone can rescue Life under the most auspi cious circumstances is uncertain but how fearfully uncertain it must be when all the destruct ive powers of warfare are brought against it. but I trust that you will live to return to your friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I heard a report yesterday that Hallie had been taken from his office and placed in the ranks by Colonel for writing a letter in the “Democrat#” not approving the move from Charleston</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie your portrait looks some? different from your discriptions of the little dirty ragged il dogge Is there as great a difference in your feelings? I shewed it to Auntie. She said- well I wont say what she said. It would make you vain to hear it I wish you knew my aunt. She is one of the dearest aunties that I or anyone else can boast of. Did you ever hear Hallie speak of her? I almost know you have. What a windy day this is. I[t] seems that the elements as well as our nation were in a fierce combat with each other. But I have not time to write much more to day. You write that you receive no letters from me. I think it very strange for I may safely say that I have written weekly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please write soon and often As ever your sister Addie</field>
