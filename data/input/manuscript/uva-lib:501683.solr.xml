      <field name="fulltext">It has been so long since I have tried to put up a letter that I am at a loſs to know how to commence. When I cast my eye up at the top of the page &amp; see the heading Alone, It calls forth a short sigh, &amp; I imagine shall it always be so, I am alone at heart, while company are around me inviting me to be cheerfull I noticed in the last Specta tor the Marrige of Mr Peck &amp; your Cous, Lizzie, Does this not create a sigh in my breast If I had been a child of for tune I might have been blest with a smiling bride, and alas I wait on the uncertain future, when thy noble heart may change towards me, &amp; eaven sco re eaven the omble path I pursue why is it that fears torment me, on thy accoun t Well I know you have never giv en me of late room to doubt you consistency, Sometimes I imagine I see you looking at me; and saying; I once loved you, but now I pity you. W e ell I know thare is know tender cord in thy posom but wich I can cause to vibrate with feelings of pity, The last time I was in your presance you desired to be united in the holy bans of marriage in Nov. The month is past &amp; you have never hurd from Mr. Dear Lady can I account for my inconsistancy It must be my carleſsneſs &amp; fate, If I could have willed it to my sadisfaction you would now be with me, But well do I recolect that I have hurd you say time and again that you never would be willing to marry me, untill I had some little home of my own to take you too. at that time I coinsided with you But know I fear many moons will grow old before I can claim a home of my own. own or such as I would have a little lot I would not have if I it was made a presan t to me I believe I could keep a mate at my presant acupation with ease. &amp; would be willing to risk it next fall. &amp; at presant but we have not house room. as Mr C, has a young couple living with him this winter. His wifes bro, Why am I writing thus, what makes my heart throp &amp; say oh Kate what must I do to make thee happy. While I am writing I am sad. I know not what recep tion this may meet with. “Maybe” cold &amp; formal, Once I believed the sight of my scribling created a pleasent sensation. But that time has propably past. &amp; may be left to morn because I was the dupe of time. Time waits for no one &amp; I have been wait ing for time. I may wait on &amp; in a few short years I may sleep with my mother earth. Dear Kate I intended comming down in four weeks from the time I was down, But my ocupation is so confining that I cannot always go when I desire. &amp; I have neglect ed writing untill I am ashamed to write, Busineſs &amp; love are two conflicting eliments, Belive me I remain yours with unchan ed devotion. &amp; if you will wait untill another Summers Sun shall paſs I will give the my hand with my heart. if not your will shall be my desire I do not know when I will get down during hollodeys I hope I will bring this to a close hoping you will excuse all my past errors &amp; love me as your Willie boy</field>
