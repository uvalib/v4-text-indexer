      <field name="fulltext">Camp Ewell Feb. 14 th /65 My Dear Kate,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I avail myself of the present opportunity to drop you a few lines I arived safly in camp the night of the 9th, Had some very roughſ weather to come down in, I thought that when I was in Staunton that if I was at home I would stay thare untill the weather would mod erate, But I had gone tofar to turn back, While in Staunton I visited your Cous,L.— She gave me a comple te scolding. I pretended at first that I had'nt been down to see you since she was out, &amp; told her that the last time, I was down I was treated in a manner that lead me to believe that the next time that I went, that I would be dis carded. &amp; that such feelings would keep my lover from the idle of thare heart, She told me that she did not believe me, But that I was getting geleous, wich you may know I desired I then told her all, The weath er has been very cold down since I came down We have no snow he ar I am very cirtain that it is not leſs than fifteen inches deep in the valley I suppose you have hurd the glad tidings t,hat all our prisners are going to be exchanged, But our hopes for pease are all crushed thare is noghtin left us now but fight. untill our broud foes shall nuckle &amp; acknowledge our independence If we should surrender now to our enimies we would I believe be one of the most downtrodden Nations in the world, So we had better con tinue our strugle untill we have all found a home in our mother earth The boys are all well &amp; in muc better spirits than I expected to find them Thay had a fight last monday week none of our Co, ware hurd, I expect a god many of the boys will go to Cavelry if we are consolidated &amp; Capt Willson takes command of us I intend to go rather than surre nnder su t ch a tyrant, I wish we could get men enoughf hear to save our old 8 for it has been a faithfull Co. &amp; I hate to see its name die out. John S ane. is getting a transfur to Gen. Lees body gard. Grieer &amp; Volen trare are getting transfurs to the 18th Cavelry &amp; Tom Campbell to mounted artilery The boys are all ancious to have thare names of the rolls of Co 8 for fear of consolidation Thare was a letter in camp from Sister waiting for me I answered her letter several day ago she was quite well Dear K you must not scold me for not writing sooner for we are kept so busy hear building our breas work that one hardly has time to write our fortifications are about a mile our from camp Thay are twelve feet thick &amp; seven feet high with three rows of abbetters in frunt look like will be imposible for Mr Yank ever to get near us, I have no news worth your attention evry thing is quiet along our lines, How did you enjoy yourself the eavning that I left I suppose you thought it a very cold parting indeed it was to me, but we have always to be governed by sircumstan ces, Dear Kate believe me to be holy thine for I am sure evry pulsation of my heart beats love to thee &amp; I hope it shall never nv nv change others have loved you &amp; may love you again, but never as devotedly as I have no other I dou'nt think could ever have the influence over me you have I want to make it my future busineſs to live and act for your hapineſ I must close soon My health is very good hope this may find you enjoying the same write soon give me all the new &amp; believe me to be your true &amp; confiding lover,</field>
