      <field name="fulltext">New Market, Va. April 28 1862 My Darling Addie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So you are going away from Mecca to be "Addie" no longer, but Mistress 1 . To leave " Maple Grove ", Papa, Laurie , and Auntie (to say nothing of the rest.) and install yourself as head of a large school, to "teach the young scholars how to shoot". I fancy I see you just ringing the first bell; then as that strange motley crowd gathers in and by pairs sort themselves, and then then as you tap the bell to secure order. I seem to see you look around as if seeking if some friend were there. Did I hear aright? Methought I heard a chapter from the Bible by way of introduction. Then I heard that silvery voice - perhaps at first tremblingly - addressing the school in accents of kindness saying you will love and wish to be loved. Do not fear, my love. I have been in the same place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I just upset my ink, and the sutler had nothing but blue. I received your letters of the 16th and 17th this morning a few moments before drill, and I actually believe that they have cured my headache, which I have had for some time. I suppose that you have broken the ice ere this, and commenced your school and I trust you will have perfect success . I cannot see why you did not receive a letter from me relative to your teaching. I left it all to yourself, for I cannot believe it my duty to decide whether you can or cannot do a thing - by no means - for on the contrary your wishes should be, and are my law . It is perhaps well that you are to teach this summer I should love to have seen you and have had a good long visit before you commenced. but - I could not. "Get ready for inspection in half an hour," is the order, and "orders must be obeyed."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must describe Claridon and its people for me. Give me your "experience. " Do you board around? If so please</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, "inspection" is over, and I will write until " Dress Parade", when of course I shall have to go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a beautiful day! But then of course, you have them at home. We had quite a heavy fall of snow the 23rd and 2 24th, and it contrasted strangely - but beautifully, with the dark Cedar and bright Peach blossoms , as it hung in wreaths upon the boughs. But it did not last long. Rain came, and the ground was soon covered with mud , instead of the pure white snow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I too love flowers and the sight of those familiar flowers, which I have often gathered "when spring time comes." filled my heart with joy, and I almost wished "I were a boy again," - ha! ha! What am I yet, but a boy ? My twenty-first year commences the 8th of next month, when, - well - I can't tell what. I guess I shall love you more , and with a more manly affection. to increase in hope as in years Hadn't I ought.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed, Hallie must have an exalted opinion of "darkies." Truly! But I am proud to know he loves me, and if I do not merit all his commendations, I cannot but be proud of the compliment. Of him , I can but say, he is Nature's nobleman - a man worthy the love of a people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is Dora to be one of your scholars this summer? If so, you must not allow too much fam in school, - I mean, you may do just as you please.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will have many trials and privations this summer, but remember that upon yourself depends all, and God will sustain and protect you. If I can be of any assistance to you in any manner, do not fail to let me know, and I will gladly render it. You know, my heart well enough by this time, to know that anything I can do for you, I would do, even die for your sake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Whirr-r-r-r tap-tap-tap-tap. Adjuts . Call. A large mail has come. Is there anything for me? Oh yes. A paper. Pshaw, why don't a letter come? Just as I wrote-thought- last word, I heard my name called, and to my joy, more mail had come, and yours and Laurie's letter was included. Now I shall write a little longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I shall try another sheet of paper. Perhaps I can fill it.</field>
