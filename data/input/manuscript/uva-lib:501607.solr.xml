      <field name="fulltext">"Office" — Nov 13th 1862 .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved your charming letter of the 2 d just as I was taking my letter of the 9th to the office and I thought I would wait and answer it. But, Addie mine, I had no idea of waiting six days ere attending to that important and not unpleasant duty — but my health was in such a state — that I was unable to attend to "office duties." But lest I frighten you, I will tell you all — just as it really was — I had a slight attack of Liver Complaint which troubled me some, but I am recovering from it now — not in my fancy — but really getting well — I am somewhat thinner and weaker than I was, but that might have been expected — During the entire time, I have remained in the office — so you see I have not been "dangerous" by any means. I should not have been so explicit, but you are so fearful I half conceal the real truth, but my darling rest assured I can conceal nothing from you — which I know you so wish to know,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will not answer your letter now — for I cannot — but I will write an early reply. How kind and trustful you are! I can only love you more and more. Oh! how I wish this War would end.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So Laurie is no longer "Laurie" but "Mrs. Thompson . Please present my compliments and all the other "nice things," to the happy pair. Success and happiness attend thee my darling this Winter Do you like Farmington?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please write very soon to Your own devoted and loving Charley</field>
