      <field name="fulltext">1865 Careysburg Aug 15 th Dr Jas Minor Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I seat myself once more to write you to in- form you that I am still with my family in the land among the living, for which I am more than thankful to God. I can truly say that the Lord has been good to us since we have been in this land in sparing our lives. My daughter instead of the little girl I brought with me is now taller than her mother. She has grown much indeed and with her mother is enjoying good health. It has been now about 4 years since I have heard from you and I must say I am over axious to hear from you once more— more so since I heard the war is about over. It must indeed have been dreadful to be in a land as America has been for the last four years— covered with all the horrors of war. But I hope it will not be long ere peace shall again be de clared and when the sound of the battle shall no more be heard. In your last letter you requested me when I write to inform you how I was am getting along. At present I am doing pretty well. I am paying the mass of my attention to the growing of cane of which I have about 8 acres. I made this year 8000 pounds of sugar which was said to be the best made around here. It is true that it is a new country, and we have many hardships to un- dergo , but by God's blessings and an effort on one's side he can get along. Here I have realized the meaning of the words: Sitting under one's own vine and fig tree and none daring to molest or make afraid. The only thing that grieves me, is that I cannot enjoy it with my children. were they with me I should be perfectly satisfied. To be so far separated from them is indeed an afflic- tion hard to bear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When Dr Jas Hall was out last I sent with him $50,00 in gold to go towards purchasing them, but when he arrived the war had commenced and whether you recieved it I am not able to say. I forwarded the receipt on to you for you to draw it from the D r to give it to my children. When you write you will please in- form me whether you recieved it or no as I am impatient to know what became of it. I had anticipated going over about two years ago, but the war commencing frustrated my purposes. It is my des- ire to see you all once more. You will please let me know whether and when it would be advisable to do so. I would now be able to recieve my children as I have built and finished a large house of marable wood consisting of 8 rooms, more than I am able to use. It is 34 x 24 built of the best materials in the country. Not long since we had an emigration from the island of Barbados of about 340. Some of them are now living in our little village which is indeed a help to us. They are quite an intelligent company and it is hoped will be the means of doing much good in our Settlement. I cannot close until I tell you that my wife is about as large as your wife and weighs about 2,00 lbs She enjoys better health than when she was in America . I hope this may find you &amp; family in the best of health as it leaves as well. All Join me in love to you &amp; family &amp; friends.</field>
