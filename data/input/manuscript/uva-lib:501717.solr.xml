      <field name="fulltext">Rome, Ga . 0ct. 22nd, 1864 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not received a letter from you since we left East Point but suppose it must be from the stoppage of the mails. Last We have got good quarters erected, we have a good house, good roof, logs, floor and fireplace and all fixed for winter but it is very doubt ful whether we shall remain here or not. We have been running round nearly all the time since we have been here and out into the country about every other day scouting round. You will see in the papers about the Allatoona fight we should have been in it but for a smash-up on the railroad between Rome and Kingston A train of cars that was coming up to get our Brigade smashed all to pieces and thrown in every direction by the spreading of the track about 9 miles from Rome. We arrived there about 2 hours too late. The contest was over, ending in a most bloody repulse of a hole division of rebels by a force not exceeding 2500 of our men; the Third Brigade of our division which left Rome the evening before us was in the battle and suffer ed severely. It was well for the rebels that our brigade that the accident happened, or we would have come up in their rear which to them would have been somewhat unpleasant. The sight of the battleground was shocking, worse than anything I ever saw before. It was not a great battle but for the number of men engaged it was as sharp as anything the present war has seen. The ground was literally thick with killed and wounded in many places, so that a man could step from one to another. We got there at dark. It rained awfully &amp; the groaning of the wounded could be heard all around us. I went to a spring for water to make coffee and nearly tumbled many times over the bodies of men in the dark. I took a stroll next morning as soon as day and the sight was horrid. But enough of this. I would like to get letters from home if possible. We have had no pay yet and I am out of paper and stamps, If you could send me a little I would like it. There is some reason for our not getting paid but I do not know it. Probably the unsettled state of things makes it dangerous for paymasters to travel. You said you could send me the Tribune if I wanted it. Well, I would like to have it first rate. All the news we get about Grant is from the papers, &amp; nearly all other news, and it would be a good thing to while away the hours of camp life if we are going to have any. Many of the boys get papers sent. Reading matter of any kind nearly is a comfort in the army.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It appears as if Hood intended to open another campaign, or they say Beauregard is in command now. There has several times expectations of his coming here. This place is strongly fortified and he has not yet made us a visit. The report is that he is away up to Blue mountains in Alabama. But I think that he had better have staid on the other side of the Chatta hoochie. They have succeeded by this unexpected move tore up a long strip of our railroad but they have not accomplished their object in driving Sherman back from Atlanta . 3 months now is fraught with very exciting, momentous events. Hurrah for Lincoln is the unanimous cry of the army as far as I have seen. A man dare not open his mouth for McClellan . I hope the end is not distant. Watchword God Grant Victory</field>
