      <field name="fulltext">The fatigues of my journey were solaced this morning by a happy meeting with your father and mother. The very favourable accounts which I had of your father's health fell short of the reality. He is asto- nishingly recovered. The reception he gave me was more than usually cordial; for which I am no doubt indebted to your recommendation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The pleasure of this was heightened by that of dining in the presence of a lady for whom I have a particular friendship. I was placed directly in front of her and was much occupied with her during the whole dinner — She did not appear to her usual advantage, and yet she was very interesting. The eloquence of silence is not a common attribute of hers ; but on this occasion she employed it par force and it was not considered as a fault. Though I am fond of hearing her speak, her silence was so well placed that I did not attempt to make her break it. You will conjecture that I must have been my self dumb with admiration. Perhaps so, and yet this was not the reason of my forbearing to invite a conversation with her. If you cannot find yourself a solution for this enigma, you must call in the aid of Mr. Church — and if he should fail to give you the needful assistance write to your friend Mr. Trumbull for an explanation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your sister Margaret is also wonderfully restored. She and Mr. Rensselaer supped with us — She never was in better spirits. The sight of these friends has diminished though not dissipated a sadness which took possession of my heart on my departure from New York . I am more and more the fool of affection and friendship. In a little time I shall not be able to stir from the side of my family &amp; friends.</field>
