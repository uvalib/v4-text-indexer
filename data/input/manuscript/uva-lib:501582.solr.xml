      <field name="fulltext">Camp Kelley, Jan 23th 1862 My dear Addie, -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After patiently waiting for several days, I have been rewarded by the reception of a kind letter from my only correspondent, and as a matter of pleasure, rather than duty, I devote this stormy evening to answer it Capt. Wood came back yesterday, and the letter you sent by him, Hallie gave me to-day. Have I not sufficiently answered it? Dear Addie, may I not consider part thereof as though it never had been written? Now as Hallie has told me all, do not for a moment think that any such thing could make me "curse" you, or even make me think otherwise of you , dear Addie, than I always have. Only allow me to love you, dearest. Will you not? You have doubtless recieved one or two letters since you wrote the letter now before me. I shall have little rest until I recieve a reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You need have no compunctions as to my compunction condemning a letter written on Sunday for it is an old proverb and with more truth than poetry, that "there are no sundays in war." and I fear I pay too little attention to such matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask as to the reason my sister does not write to me. If I knew the reason, I would have no objection to telling you. I know of no reason unless she partakes of the prejudices which the entire family seem to hold against me. She is very proud, and doubtless LOVES ME . I cannot write of these things, you can imagine my feelings, but I will assure you that I am FREE FROM DISHONOUR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sunday morning, - I could not write any more last evening, so will finish this morning. Hal is coming home soon, but I suppose he has acquainted you with the circumstances. I would give a great deal to accompany him, but I suppose there will be soon a "Forward move on the Potomac ," and it will require every man who is able, to "go along." You know if in the face of a contemplated attack, I were to apply for a furlough, it would sound like cowardice, and of all things I detest a coward. However much I would like to come home, it must be deferred Hallie will tell you all about me when he comes. perhaps I can come at the close of the war. meanwhile my home must be</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"In the snowy tent a warrior loves"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last night it was stormy, today it is clear and cold The mud is frozen, and it is so very hard walking.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My dear Addie, you must excuse me for not writing a longer letter, for my head aches, and my brain is in a perfect whirl of excitement. But I must ask you again to recall those words in the letter Wood brought, and allow me to love you . Will you not, dearest Addie? I cannot help writing thus, forgive me if I do wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Addie, write soon and often to your true and faithful Charlie. God will help you from evil, darling, and will give you all . Your Charlie.</field>
