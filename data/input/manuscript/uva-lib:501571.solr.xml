      <field name="fulltext">Charleston, Va. Dec 3rd Dearest Addie:-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I owe you more than a simple apology for neglecting to write the sweetest being God ever made (I am not flattering, my heart tells me so) but perhaps your throne of beauty "may be a throne of mercy and its occupant may perchaner be lenient toward an humble subjects and forgive me for this time. Shall I act the stately and say, "Forgive me, my Case, and hereafter I will be "?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But, dear Addie, I will strive hereafter to be more punctual, It is not because I did not wish to write that I have not sooner answered your letters and acknowl- edge the recipt of your beautiful present, but for reasons which are in themselves "cogent," as a lawyer would say, (Now is that the word? I sawit used in that way any how,) The weather has been very severe, for the past - few , weeks, (the boys are making such an uproar I can seurely concentrate my thoughts) and we are still in our thin Summer tents and we are rather crowded, Imagine how twelve men would occupy the little room in which I staid at your home, and you can have an idea of our situation. my health is very good. never better in my life. I will own dear Addie, that it is for your sake that it have been so particular in regard to my health, as I have been, for previous to my visit at your happy home, I considered myself friendly and alone. Perhaps I should have said until I made the auquaintance of your noble brother, for I owe to him the happi- ness of meeting you and the consequent (to me)interesting) correspondend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Capt Asper gave me the beautiful l present you so kindly sent me, I cannot thank you too much, or show you gratitude enough for this express- ion of your regard for one. How can I repay you? I can assure you that it is a very useful present, and that I will try to win your lasting favor,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You called yourself my “Ohio Sister”. Indeed Addie, you are , any more than sister. and I hope to prove my- self worthy of a sister's love . May I hope for it?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You asked one what I thought of the supercedure of Gen. Fremont . Now Fremont always was a favorite of mine and I think think that the Government has done an irreparable injury to the loyal people of Va. , in listening to the slanders of Frank P. Blair , and in the consequent removal of Fremont from the command of the noble army which he alone as I may say, organised He won the love of his men, and challenged the admiration of the world. Gen . Halleck will hardly come up to the mark Fremont has made. I am heartily glad Fremont's Body-Guard took the course they did, and urged their being mustered out of service. But "what can't be cured, must be endured" you know. We soldiers must be chary of comp- laints of the doings of the cabinet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask me if Camp. Warren is as beautifully situatid as Camp Dennison I do not think it is. Still the situation is the best that could be found.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not know how soon Hal will come home, probably not until Wood returns. I shall be most happy to accompany him when he does come, and to make you a visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Really I guess I shall have to by another sheet.</field>
