      <field name="fulltext">East Clarindon August 31 st 1862 My own loved Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although two weeks was spent in anxiety yet the blessed last arrived. that "Charlie-- my darling friend[?] is safe. You will wonder perhaps when I tell you that I had not entertained such ing fears in regard to your safety as formerly specially about the line of the battles of . I pray- ed just as for the of my loved one. but something seemed to me so confidently ly Your Charlie is safe" that I would not doubt. Indeed dearest Charlie I felt more gl today than I have since darling that you are perfectly safe and that these strange emotions are not caused by the possibility of your being in danger. How strange it is that we are not so willing to listen to the voice of fear as we are to that of safety. I have been trying all day to dispute[?] these dismal thoughts but have not succeeded and have concluded to sit down and give you a good long "talking to" but I con- fess I do not know what to talk to you about. I can forgive you darling for not telling me the exact position you were to occupy should an engage- ment occur. but you must not repeat it. please do not love I prefer knowing your exact position as far a[s?] you can acquaint me of it. Had you fallen dearest. and in time I had learned that you had--forgive me darling for the the thought--decieved me I know not what my feelings would have been, but--I can imagine. I was sorry to learn of the misfortune of your friend Geo. Moore [(]is he my friend too[?)] trust he has recovered ere this, Was John Chaffee in the engagement? How does he prosper. and how does Steven Bishop prosper Although I never was very much in his Mr Bishops favor yet as he is a soldier I feel the same interest in his welfare that I do in others who are so bravely defending the "Stars and Stripes"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are constantly hearing rumers of and defeats on the Rappahannock which causes the most intense excitement and speculation among those I call cowards ,, They are the more deserving of the name because they will quietly sit and listen while they are being called thus. I believe some people regard "cowrd" as a kind of pet name at least they are willing to bear it and I must say it becomes them most admirally.. Dear Charlie I attended a wedding last tuesday. Mr. Henry Hathaway. and Miss Laura Carver. They were married at Little Mountain out near Painesville. A splendid place. How do you think I felt when I looked upon that happy pair she standing beside the chosen one ready to utter that solemn promise, while my thoughts were way off with my chosen one, laboring so hard and enduring so much for what? His country. Ah. my soldier boy Charlie is far worthier of the love the [pure?] undying love of [a? unc] true and noble woman. than the Mr Hathaway. who refused about ten months ago to "go to war" when his betrothed told him if he felt it to be his duty to go to fight to go, and leave her. she could wait till his return or she could first marry him and he could then go. But poor fellow he finally concluded he would stay and court the favor of his "lady love" than of the secesh bullets, How patriotic truly! Charlie do you think I would promise to love honor and obey such a man, Why as for the first. I couldnt. for the second. I would'nt and as for the last I need'nt for if I should a little piece of he would be frightened to death. But what am I tracing[?] You will say "A strange girl. go to his wedding and [write?] this about him" If he should ask me my opin =ion of him I should tell him just so.. But "what can't be cured must be endured," you know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved a letter from Hallie a few days ago he expects to be mustered out of service in a few days and come home. I wish Charlie would accom- pany him but I dont see but that you are to remain in "Old Virginny" as long as the war lasts. Y Dora had answered your letter yet. She has not. I handed her a letter addressed to you and asked her to answer yours. the[?] answer in mine and put it in the office. She said she would but last night she told me that she did not have time to answer it She will soon. perhaps will send with this.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">My darling. Several days have passed since I commenced this. but circumstances prevented me from finishing it.. You have been neglected darling most cruelly.. .but I will write often enough now to make up past deficiencies, I am laboring under a great deal of fear and anxiety on your account loved one knowing as I do of the serious trouble in [unclear] Virginia, but I will try to believe that you will be spared. I have not heard from you in a long time. or at least it appears to be a long time. but I am [across the top] always ready to assign some excuse for you and now I think that the reason why you do not write is because you are so constantly harassed the 1 enemy. I never saw such and excitement as has been for the past week. The fact that the rebels are so near Cincinnati. has aroused northern Ohio to the certainty. that some thing must be done, and that quickly.. Men are ready to protect their own state and will do it. Thursday evening, twenty from this town volunteered to go to Cincinnati, but all were not acceptedt. When will this cruel war end. many hearts are becoming faint and discouraged. but I live on trusting and hopeful. Hallie will be homein a few days. and then we shall have a reason of rejoicing. but Charlie absence will be none the less deeply regretted. I not be happy if Charlie could come? but itis nearly school time and I must close Please write soon and direct to Mecca as I shall be there before your answer will reach me. May heaven guard thee ever dearest and protect thee for your</field>
