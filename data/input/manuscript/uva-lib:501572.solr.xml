      <field name="fulltext">Parkersburg Va Dec 11 th 1861 . My dear Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here we are, right in sight of loyal Ohio but refus ing ed the privil i e ge of entering within its borders, the authorities preferring that we should remain on the “sacred soil of Virginia .” But we are not long to have the privilege even of looking at the Ohio Shore, for at four P.M. we take the R. R. for Grafton . From thence I suppose we go to the end of the world,— Romney . Well, as I am denied the happiness of seeing my Addie . I will resort to the only feasible expedient, that of conversation on paper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My health is good, how is yours Addie , dear? How glad I am that writing was invented long ago, and that I have a good memory, for I seem to see you. sitting by your sweet toned melodeon 1 , your soul giving utterance to its goodness in happy song, the music of which seems to reach me, and enliven my inmost spirit. How glad am I, that to know and feel that you are at this moment holding me in kind remembrance. Happiness, is a boon many strive to reach, but few, comparatively, attain, but if happiness exists among soldiers, it is him, who knows that there is a heart which beats in unison with his own, and feels that her spirit is watching over him, that is the fortunate possessor. Am I mistaken in believing that there is one who thus remembers me, and that one, Addie ? Forgive me if do wrong in thus plainly express- ing myself, for it is the promptings of my heart, and my conscience reproves me often for not doing as I ought. I speak thus to hush its reproving voice. But, although our acquaintance has been short, has it been productive of ill? has your heart not been moved in unison with mine? but I'll bide my time, perhaps I may meet you again. Forgive me if I have done wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In a few short hours, we leave the pleasant view of Ohio , and retreat to the wilds of Virginia , perhaps never to return, for I learn by the way that we are to enter the field again. If I fall I fall in the defense of my once happy country. I shall die, "unwept, unhonored, and unknown;" but of this, in the main, I care not, all I wish to know is that if I fall I shall be regretted by one . Assured that such is the case. I die happy But less lest I weary you I will change the subject. We left Charleston yesterday at 2 P.M. on the steamer “ Decatur ” and arrived at Pt. Pleasant at 7.40 we rode all night, most of the time racing with the Fort. Wayne on which was part of the Regt . At about 11.30 A.M. to day we arrived here. I suppose as the Seventh is accredited as a good Regt. we must keep our name by deserving it</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. Forgive all errors and mistakes. as I am writing in the cabin of the Decatur , and all is confusion. and write soon to Your true Charlie , I will send you our address as soon as I learn where it is. Hal urges your and Lauries going to Oberlin , and sends a note. my respects to all and love to Addie .</field>
