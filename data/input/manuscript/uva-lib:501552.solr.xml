      <field name="fulltext">At Dora's Home school. Monday Sept., 22 nd 1862 Loved Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going to write you a good long letter to day. for I expect it will be the last one I shall write you while I remain in Claridon, ( Charlie Charlie make Dora go away, she is emphasizing my " good letters"..) So you thought my letter of Aug, 18 th short did you dear? I am sure I know not what I on the lengrh of it, but I guess this will be long enough to make up for past deficeincies . I am going to answer your dear letter of the 9 th in every particular, so here goes. certainly I will forgive you for writing on such poor paper, but do not think that I care for the paper, no. no. if your's are only such dear kind letters are you only and always do write, they will be a precious treasure to me. even if writeen on poor paper remember I am thankful for even one word from you. come what way it may, (My hand trembles this morning for some reason. I guess it is because I have been walking.) I was very glad to learn that your health was so good. I sometimes won= der why it is that you retain such good health while others, who evidently enjoyed just as good health as you when they entered the service. have come home many of them with shattered constit= tions. others--to die, Yes darling, I have often very often wondered at this, and while thus wondering, evne my rebellious heart looks up with a sweet assurance and murmurs, "God is very good" May you still continue to recieve that blessing. for blessing it is I was pleased with the resume . you gave me. In reference to your diet. you have something new for breakfast every moring do you not? Coffee. meat. and crackers. also crackers meat and coffee, quite a variety. nevertheless I am fearful that i should soon become tired of it. Time must pass very wearily with you. would that I could pass spend a few hours with you daily. in useful and interesting conversation, But think you not love that. with me time also passes very wearily? The same weary waiting. watching with longing eyes for the time when peace shall be restored, and. Charlie can come home to--me. May God preserve thee darling. till that hope shall be realized.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In speaking of your Gen's they also have to "run the gauntlet" of a rigid criticism here in the north The late movements in Maryland and Virgin- =ia have thrown a different aspect over military matters . Those who have always believed in McClellans loyalty are perfectly jubilant while those who have showered the most abusive invectives are sullen and silent looking forward and almost wishing that McCl l ellan may be defeated if and brought to sidgrace if for nothing more than to prove that their former assertions were not wholly untrue.. How does "Night Hawk" take now. I enjoyed quite a hearty lauch over that "scandal" and especialy over that "adored mustache." You say you wish I could hear the rumors of the army for one day, I can not say that I have any particular desire to hear them for the rumors here keep s me in a perfect ly whirl of excitement indeed I believe if I had not been a girl of pretty strong mind I should have been whirled our of the state of Ohio, for many men (and you know they are of stronget mind than the women) not a bit of it Dora have been seen "whirling" for Canada as fast as their feet could carry them, and did not stop till they were saluted whith , "Have you a pass" Then their consternation is wonderful and even laughable to behold. You ask me if I am not fearful some daring rebel will not make a raid up into good old Trumbull Co.? No, not a bit. If they did I am certain that they would meet with such a reception--perhaps of cold lead, that they would soon have to retreat to the sunny south again to obtain warmth enough to keep them alive. Old Trumbull has enough men to stand her ground against quite a host of rebels yet, and when her sons fail her daughters will then take the field. there are enough and brage hearts left in Ohio yet to defend her soil, and it will be defende[d] if it is at the cost of losing every boy al man of which she can boast. Oh! it would have done your heart good to have seen the men starting. with musket. shot-gun or any thing defensive which could be found. for Cincinnati when the startling news arrived the the "Queen City of the West" was being shelled. Little boys of the age of ten or twelve years, would run with determined countenances and ask, "Mother can't I go and help fight. Husbands and fathers would leave their homes and families, with hearts too full for utterance to repeat the word "Good- =bye." exclaming "a rebels foot shall never desecrate our own our beautiful Ohio." While others.--painful sight. would shudder, stand back and sullenly exclaim. "Enough with out me" But I am happy to say that there were but few of this latter chaps. Soon the joyful news arrived that the rebels were fast retreating. and those who had left their homes so hastily were permitted to return again.</field>
