      <field name="fulltext">Dear Frances,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In looking around my humble little parlour for some memento of our cottage to bestow upon you, I could think of nothing more appropriate than my perfectly proportioned inkstand and arrowy pen. They have little value in themselves, but they come from one whose heart is full of sincere affection for you. God bless you, my dear young friend, and preserve that pure simplicity of character, which makes you such a diamond in the desert of this pretending world.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I return the "Spirit's Voyage," because my new destination makes it impossible for me to prepare the book, in which I intended to insert it. The little volume that accompanies it was loan -ed by Mrs Wells sometime since.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Many thanks for your beautiful and affectionate lines about my garden. I shall take them to England with me, as a memento of the dear dove-cot, and your own sweet self.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am ashamed of Mr. Lauriat. He does not behave like a gentleman; but this is not my fault.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my kind regards to your sister and Miss Parsons. I wish I could see them again before I go to England; but I hope to see them early when I come back. I shall try hard to make my long-promised visit to you before I go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me most kindly and respectfully to Mr. Osgood. I am glad he is taking the portrait of that great and good man, Mr. Thompson. I will take care that it shall be well known in England, where it will at least do him no injury. When shall I see you there? My heart will give you both a warm welcome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Again, may God bless you, and enable you through trust in Him, to make a blessed use of the genius wherewith he has richly endowed you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your very Affectionate Friend, L. Maria Child.</field>
