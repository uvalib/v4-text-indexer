      <field name="fulltext">Alone Mills Sept. 6 th 1867 Dear Kate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved yours of the first on the 5 was glad to hear from you. I wrote to you one day last week but it seems you had'nt recieved it when you wrote to me. I am glad your Pa has consented to let us have a few waters, I had almost came to the conclu sion of writing to you, that we would go to Saunton &amp; have our hands joined before some of our dedicated alters. Oh Kate you sencure me of being carleſs in my duty to you. have I not had trials to contend with. No one can imagine the feelings, when a parent treats with contumely the one that would always deisred to have loved., But let me change before I make you sad. Dear Kate you know my heart. I believe it to be tender. yes even to idolitry towards you. &amp; I do not believe it has been my foolish infatuation for it has been tested by years of trials-&amp; know I hav nt but one regret in joining our hands in partnership for life. &amp; that is that I have no home that I can call my own to take you two. This ought not to discur lb&gt; age any one with health-for thousands have star ed in this world on the same footing &amp; have raised up to the highest pinical fame. I intend to do my &amp; trust in the God of our Fathers and I know he is no respecter of persons Dear Kate as you desire me to make a selection of one of the Lady attendants,I will nominate Miſs Mary Lizzie Wallace, &amp; would forther desire that she should wait with Mr. Lindsay. Now for our bridal tour I propose going to Wearers Cave, with our attendants &amp; then croſs the Mtn to Buckingham. and take some of our attend ants if they will go. J. Vines is very ancious to go with us if he can get company &amp; a horse &amp; buggie. I have written that I entended going over to uncles and am certain they would think hard of me if I did not come I am very ancious to go. And I am Sure you will be highly pleased. &amp; I know o fno time that will suit us as well as the presant. It is not far to the Natural Bridge from hear &amp; I can take you thare almost any thr time I am ancious to see it. &amp; more to plese you in every thing. But hope you will think it our best policy at presant to visit my relations east of the Ridge. Dear Kate I am trying to do that wich is write in the sight of my Maker. &amp; I pray that he may give me grace from time to time so I may be a useful member in society. &amp; in the world to come reap life everlasting I must close as Mer Chaplin has got out his house &amp; is waiting on me.</field>
