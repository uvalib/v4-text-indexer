      <field name="fulltext">My dear friend,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Would you be offended if I were to say my dear Addie? for I'm sure I would much rather call you by the name my heart prompts me to. I am very well quite so. and trust you are. Brig--or rather Lieut. Case is also quite well. He has improve a great deal since he left home. and you may rest assured that he will be well cared for, for we all love him very much I know there is no man to whom I am as much attached as to your brother, you may well be proud of such a brother. I prophecy that no man will sooner reach a place in the hearts of the people equal to Col. Ellsworth or even Stephen A. Douglas or Lincoln, [part of page missing] than your brother, H [part of page missing] B. Case.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We arrived here last [missing] night about four oc[lock] [missing] the boys all well. [missing] month men, we [missing] Friday night. They were dismissed and on their way home. I think they ought to have seen service before going home; however I don't care now for perhaps I may have a chance (although a small one) to get in some more genial position for I must confess that I have a secret desire to merit a promotion.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Two Regiments, the 9 th &amp; the Artillery left here this morning for Virginia, and a rumor is current, but you know how to believe them, to the effect that the Seventh Reg't. is to go in a week or two. I wish it may be so, but I would like very much to see Addie once more, still I do not expect to, unless you come down this week with the ladies of Warren Mrs. Stull informed me that they were coming down this week or next, now you might just as well come down as not coming down here is, I know, no small affair, but I understand the railroad presidents will allo[w] them, (from Warren) to pass free This is a beautiful day here, a cool breeze is rustling through the leaves (for you must know that while we were home the boys made a sort of bower over the alley between the buildings) and the sky is slightly overcast with clouds Altogether this is pleasant. There is something fascinating in it to me I am healthier, stronger and can do more here than in any other business But there is some thing more fascinating and that is Addie Case. But I dare not hope that you think more of me than a common friend. If I could only know that you do, how happy I would be-- but pshaw, I am writing nonsense pray forgive me for I cannot help it. Are you well now? and do you have pleasant times, now the soldiers are gone?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Does Laura know that I am going to correspond with you? If she does, give my kind regards to her.But I have wearied you patience too much already so I will not write any more. If you are not displeased with this please write very soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Meanwhile rest assured I remain Yours truly &amp; affectional[ity] Charlie Tenney P.S. Would you have any objection to our changing ambrotypes! if not I will send mine next time I write. Address Cha[ ]. N. Tenney Care of Capt Asper Co. H. 7 th Regt [?] . [?] .M. Camp Dennison Ohio Camp. June 16 th 1861.</field>
