      <field name="fulltext">Keeping house once more Feb. 15th evening 1862 My own darling Addie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your darling letter was received today, and I improve the first opportunity to try to answer it. I say try , for I am inad- equate to the task of making my letters as interesting as yours, but if they are as productive of happenings as you persist in saying they are, why, I will give you any quantity of them. Yours , well, I can compare them to nothing but angels visits, and like them, I could wish they were more frequently received. You may imagine my joy at receiving yours today it made me happy, for it reassurred me that you love me, and you know, how that is. Do you not</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, to inform you of our "situation." We are now some three miles from Pawpaw Tunnel on the R. R. (ask- us on the R.R.)in our tents once more. After a ten day's exposure to the weather, it does seem good to once more enjoy the comforts of tented life. I did not know that we live so comfortable in tents in the winter, but I have suffered more while living in a house, than I do here; still, the idea of having but one thickness of canvas between us and the weather, is - well it makes one shiver to think of it. Now dont imagine any new horror at our situation, for if we were in any danger I would inform you. I know you are anxious to know every particular as regards my health &amp;c. so I will say that with the exception of a very slight cold, I was never more healthy in my life You seldom say anything of your health, do you enjoy perfect health? Now, you must inform one if you are well, will you not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest Addie , have you any objection to trusting your miniature to my keeping now ? In your letter of June 23 d , you say, "I think that where a gentleman and lady are engaged, then they should change portraits." We are not really engaged, but may I not hope- nay know that on the receipt of an answer to this that we are?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you consent to - to change portraits, will you say yes ? Mine! be mine, love. I shall be so happy. This war cannot always last, and I can feel sure like living then . I am not rich Addie , I had been so happy, that I scarcely bestowed a thought in that direction, and I fear I do wrong in asking you to become mine, poor as I am. yet, I cannot help feeling that I am not wrong. Are you willing to accept me as I am, a soldier? dependent upon myself? If you consent, I will strive to make you all that you wish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But you will wish me to speak of other subjects You are not jealous of me, are you, as regards Laurie are you? Surely you cannot have any objection to her calling me "brother," have you? May I call her "Sister"? and write her just a line or two?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We do miss Hal very much , but then I do not wish him back, for his sake, at least, I know Tyler &amp; him cannot possibily agree. I wish Tyler would follow John Tyler, or at least, would leave the 7th Ohio.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close, as it is sure past tattoo, My best wishes are yours, and my love Give my kind regards to all. Direct as usual Have you a spare picture for me, Addie . Love? From your loving Charlie who would die for you</field>
