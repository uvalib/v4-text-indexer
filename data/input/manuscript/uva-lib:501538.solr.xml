      <field name="fulltext">Thursday morn. May 16 th , 1862 , My darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Who would have thought when I wrote you last that more than a week would elapse before I should write you again. But how fast time does fly. I know you will forgive me darling for you know how little time a teacher gets to write especially where they "board around." I should have written sunday but I attended church both in the daytime and evening and between the meetings I wrote to Hal. I recieved your letter of the 11 th and 22 nd of April last evening. Laura forwarded them from Mecca Had I not heard from you since then I should be real anxious for you wrote that you was not well, but I can hardly conceal my anxiety now for I have recieved but one letter from you since I commenced my school with the exception of the one I read last eve. You are not ill are you dearest? I feel confident that you would let me know if you were. (I am writing in such a hurry this morning as it is almost school time) I was very thankful for your letters although written so long ago, besides one from Laurie accompaniament there Indecent (how correct that is spelled) Dear Charlie you seem to be quite eloquent in your praises of your "Ohio girl" I do not blame miss Rice for replying to you that I was not pretty, for I too think you must look with a partial eye, for I can trace no expressions of beauty in my ugly phyg. although I — don't try much. I dont see how she could "hate Yankees" after conversing with you, I would not . Yes darling I am proud of it, I mean that I am a Yankee, and if you should ever see her again please tell her "that the Yankee girls" would not only sacrifice home friends, dear friends but even lie to protect their country and their flag. Oh Charlie how I should love to see a regt of ladies armied equipped and ready for battle, but that we must remain at home and donate a little to the "Aid society," every week while our friends and protectors fall and die alone with no friend near. Oh it makes me so indignant. But what could we do? Do! we could fight, fight like patriots as we are, but perhaps you will say you guess our patriotism would cool down by the time we march one or two thousand miles, strong if it unclear !</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After school.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie I did not have time to finish this this morning; therefore one more day will pass ere you will recieve it; but I will try to answer or rather finish this. Do you think darling that I am dilatory about my writing to you? If so remember that I can not always do, as I would were I at home, but I will write as often as possible. You wished me to give you my experience in boarding round. I will give you my experiences of two evenings by way of contrast I have chosen these. You must pardon the crude form in which it is expressed for I wrote it down hastily, in my--what shall I call it, "Experience Diary" I guess, and copy from that Tuesdday eve, May 14th, "Really this looks like boarding around!" I wonder if all teachers have the same form, Emily Buell told me to day that "her father wanted me to come to his house to night" I will go was my answer accompanied with a wonder where her mother was. Started with the girls Emily and Evaline and — came as I came through the gate I involuntarily turned partially up to a side door. "This is the way" the girls said and I followed, around the through through house we went till we came to a kind of alley through which we passed and after going through a shed entered an underground kitchen, I was introduced to "my sister" a girl about twenty years of age, and "my grandmother" an old lady sitting in a straight backed armchair smoking, on her head was a night ccap and around her head passing from her chin up was a kind of bandage. I afterword learned that "my Grandmother's" name was Mrs. Duelley , and that the reason of her wearing the bandage was that she was afflicted with a cancer. Mr. Buell did not enter the house until after tea which consisted of meat potato beans pork and indian pudding baked. I sat there by the window (or rather under it) for I had to stand in under to look out — vainly endeavoring to draw some one into conversation with me. At eight oclock I was requested to be shown my room and went but what a soute to get to a sleeping apartment; after ascending a narrow flight of stairs we pass (my "sister" and I) though two rooms and then ascended another flight of stairs going through a hall and entered "my room," I turned to ask the unclear a question but she had sat the candle down and left there, and here I find my self. and I also find myself writing my first experience in "boarding around," but of written till late and must retire alone. I would willingly accept of one of the the girls for a "bedfellow." but I suppose they are in that dismal kitchen perhaps conversing of the new school ma'am and I will not disturb them"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, I have given my experience while at one family, or the evening experience nothing of importance unclear in the morning unclear I was about to start in the morning for school. I was cooly invited to brand them "my past" Grief. I will but I have not time to write my other experience but will soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 1 boy is awaiting to carry this to the office and if I do not send it now I can not this week therefore I will close yours forever Addie I 2 must bid you good bye darling although undoubtably I have written in such a hurry that I fear you will not be able to read it but guess what you can not read. I forgot to mention that I have some twenty-eight scholars, write often darling, Addie</field>
