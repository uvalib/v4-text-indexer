      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Feb. 3 rd . 1862 Dearest,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How thankful I was tonight, when handed you dear letter, and then the dear thoughts - your own thoughts - my darling - that it contained. Also the beautiful sketch which you sent me. Thanks, are but a poor recompense for such treasures but you know they are the best I can afford. "these hard times".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you think these beautiful days (although it has not been as pleasant to day) weary and monotonous? Bless you my darling, I had thought them very, very short and pleasant. There is but one thing which keeps me from being truly happy, and that is the return, of that one who is dearer to me than life. Why should I not be happy now, dearest, happy in your love, but there is an irresistable desire within my breast, for your presence, which I can not conquer. and yet I am happy as the word is generally expressed and yet I can no say that I am really con- tented. I sometimes feel as the little riverlet appears. It seems to know that there is a large body of water waiting and anxious to receive it, Thus it is with me. I seem to think that there is a nobler better being, whose love is a strong unceasing tide waiting for the time when he can call me his own. Therefore I can scarcely keep from wishing that time (not water) would flow more swiftly. So you received the picture did you? I felt quite flattered when I read your thoughts if it. Indeed dearest I think you must have forgotton how your Addie looks for people told me here that the portrait was - prettier than the original and - was I foolish. ... I believed it. Can it be that I have changed so much since last June?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I confess I feel changed for circumstan ces have transpired since then which have cruelly and deeply wounded my pride. But I will not fill up these lines with gloomy thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest, what frightful reports came to town this morning that there had been a battle on the Potomac and forty thousand southerners killed and wounded. I was over to Miss Leaslie's when I heard of it. I sprang and uttered some exclamations, I know not what, and fell back, Oh! heavens! the agony of that mom- ent. The boy that brought the report said that the Seveneth suffered the most of any of the army. Dora was frightened at my paleness. She, dear good girl, "would not belive one word of it" "It was all false, just told to frighten folks " How I thanked her for the little hope she breathed to me. My excitement soon fled and tonight I too can repeat her words for the paper contains no such report At that moment I dared not breathe my fears but she read them and tried to quiet them. By the way Charly you remember the playful little title I .... to designate her by "My wife" she will not allow one to hold one now she says she has obtained a divorce because ..... But what an interesting letter I am writing to you am I not. How sorry I am that the officers are resigning in the Seventh. I certianly do not wish to</field>
