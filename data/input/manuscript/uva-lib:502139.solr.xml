      <field name="fulltext">You have no idea how glad I was when your dear letter was handed me. I thought I was entirely banished from your memory but your kind letter gave me understand that there is still place a place in your noble heart that sometimes promts you to think of me. Well in the first place I will tell you how it is looking in camp this day it looks and feels very much like snow it has been raining for several days hope it will cleare off soon for I get so tired in doors all the time I am so glad spring is so nigh most ever person are but one deep has been scarce, I took one good sleigh ride You wanted to know what kind of xmas I spent. I had a very happy time went to an xmas tree it was a very grand one but there wasent a present for me wasnt that too bad, but one consolation it was out of the neighborhood &amp; wasent disapointed You bet I would like to see your little boy but would rather see my darling Friend I so often think of him I can hardly wait untill you send me there Photoes I will have some taken next Fall if I live &amp; will send you one I guess I will get a letter from you about that time is Rose B staying with you now? wish I could step in and have a long chat I could tell you so much more than I can write but as we are deprived of that</field>
