      <field name="fulltext">Green Spring Run , B &amp; O R.R. Dec 14 th 1861 My dear friend;-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lest you toss all knowledge of our whereabouts, I again send you a few lines. We are well and in good spirits, but as yet uncertain as to where we shall be sent. We are now under Brig. Gen. Kelley's command and he was to come to us yester- day , but owing to illness he did not come, consequently we are now awaiting orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must give you a brief account of our ride from Parkersburg , where I wrote to you on the 9 th . We left that place at 5 O'clock P.M. in low freight cars. There are three seats in each car running lengthwise of the car. Two cars were allowed to a company. Of the country through which we came that night I know but little save that is very rough, amounting even to the mountainous. You can judge of that when I say that we passed through thirteen tunnels in twenty-seven miles. We passed through Clarksburg about half past three in the morning. Here is where we left the R. R. when we came into Va.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Just (there isn't that a beautiful letter?) 1 before day light we passed through Grafton , and just as the silver beams of morning were scattering darkness away, we were instantaneously plunged into total darkness; an interva l of several minutes, and as suddenly we emerged into almost broad daylight. We had passed through a tunnel seven eighths of a mile in length.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We stopped at Oakland in Maryland and cooked our breakfast, dinner and supper. About ten A.M. we again started on, and arrived at Cumberland, Md. just at dark. Here we were warmly welcomed by hundreds of Ladies and gentlemen, we re- mained here about half an hour, and then we were dragged on by our tireless Iron horse to Green Spring Run where we now are.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now dear Addie , imagine yourself a soldier jolted along for hundreds of miles in a cold uncom- fortable freight car, night and day, and then when you stopped be obliged to lie wherever you could perechance in a cold corner of a car, or perhaps " en bivouack " by the side of a fire which you must often replenish, or freeze. Suppose for a moment you were there situated and you have some idea of our way of living. We are now without tents but expecting new ones every day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But you remember the old adage "there is no great loss without some small gain."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although we will have probably less pleasure here than if we had staid at Charleston , yet I have had an old wish realized, that of visiting the valley of the upper Potomac. From Oakland we descended into the valley. From this point the scenery was delightful still I think I seen that more beautiful, but none so grand and wild. Hillsides were covered with rocks on one side, while on the other they were covered with fertile fields. Here were abrupt preci- pices hundreds of feet high and here luxuriant valleys. I would give much to see this region of country in the height of Summer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You would laugh if you could see us, Hal &amp; I sitting under a straw-stack He engaged in writing a letter to his friend the "Democrat," and I one to my friend "the Lovely."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well. Hal has finished his letter &amp; is now waiting for me. I don't care: he can wait for me or go to the other boys. Am I not independent?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would like to see you now. I suppose you have sleighing now, do you not? Please take one ride for me, will you not, and be happy and joyous as you can. I know you remember me for I seem to feel your presence every day and night. I never felt happier in my life than since I knew you loved me well enough to style your self my sister; am I worthy of being called a brother?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hal is now writing another letter while I am done. 2</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is Laurie well? and your mother and Father? How is Oil-dom generally? By the bye, I learn of a new use for Mecca Oil. A Mr. Trowbridge of Meadville Pa has applied for a patent for a new bomb-shell. A quantity of Rock Oil is put into the shell with the Powder so when the shell explodes the oil ignites and fires whatever it touches. Novel is it not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What do you think of the movements of Gen. McClellan ? Is his policy one of those brilliant actions which characterized the first Napoleon ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And Gen. Halleck too? What do you think of his grand withdrawl of troops from central Mo ? Perhaps though, as Price's plan is to remove the field to Kansas . Halleck wishes to lure him back to Missouri , and severely whip him but he is not Fremont . I suppose from henceforth you will anxiously look for tidings from the army of the Potomac , instead of that of Westim Va. Very natural though. I hope Gen. McClellan will begin to draw in the lines which he has so successfully extended around the Rebels, soon, and if he does you may look for exciting news from the Potomac .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I fear this is getting uninteresting to you, if indeed you can read it all. But perhaps you will excuse me, and if as Paddy says " If you can't rade this pleze sent it back. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will write soon, will you not? and direct your letters to me in leave of Capt. Arper , 7 th Ohio Reg't. Valley of Virginia Via Cumberland.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When you write, please write me a good long letter and remember you are writing to one who loves you dearly, and would if necessary die for you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must now bid you farewell for the present. Remaining yours forever Charlie Tenney P.S. I write on a rough board in my lap sitting in the smoke, so please excuse the poor writing. Respects to all &amp; Love and Heavens blessings for the dearest Addie .</field>
