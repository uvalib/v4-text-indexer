      <field name="fulltext">My Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A press of other engagements has prevented me, hitherto, from replying to your letter of the 24 th ult : — but I have not the less borne it in mind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I need not speak to you of the difficulties I have to encounter daily in selecting from the mass of M.SS . handed in for The Messenger [2] . Personal applications from perso- nal friends, of course embarrass me greatly. It is, indeed almost impossible to refuse an article offered in this manner without giving mortal offence to the friend who offers it. This offence, however, is most frequently taken by those who have the fewest pretensions to merit. In the present instance I feel perfectly sure that I shall neither wound your feelings, nor cause you to think less of me as an acquaintance by returning your Poem — which I now enclose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My reasons for declining it, relate as much to your- self , individually, as to the Magazine. I feel exceedingly de- sirous that you should be even more favorably known to the public than you are at present, and that this object should be accomplished thro' the medium of the Messenger. I have fre- quently seen pieces from your pen which I would have been hap- py to insert — one long poem, especially, whose title I cannot call to mind — with some lines lately printed in the Baltimore Athenaeum — that great bowl of Editorial skimmed milk and water. I think you will agree with me that “The Consumptive Girl” is not, for my means, a fair specimen of your talents. Like all I have seen of your compositions, it breathes the true spirit of poetic sen- timent and feeling — it has fine and original images — and has all the proper material of the Muse. But it is deficient in the outward habiliments. The versification, in especial, is not what you can make it. The lines in most instances, are rough, &amp; owing to your frequent choice of words abounding in consonents. Thus in the beginning. One burning spot blush'd on her smooth fair cheek . In some cases the verses are more seriously defective, and cannot be scanned — or even read. For example. To the heart — Hope's death, love's blight, faded joys And again — Long hair unbound fell o'er her swan-like neck wildly</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I know you will reply, and with some appearance of justice, that much worse verse, have appeared in The Messenger, since my Edi- torship , and are still appearing. But these are poems which have been long on hand, and to the publication of which Mr. W. [3] had bound himself, by promises to their respective authors, before my time. Such difficulties shall not occur again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Suppose you were to try a series of brief poems — say sonnets — one to appear regularly in each number of the Maga- zine . Embodying multum in parvo [4] — laboured out with scrupulous care in their metre — and signed with your in- nitials — they will not fail (if done as well as I know you can do them) to gain you a high and permanent reputa- tion .</field>
