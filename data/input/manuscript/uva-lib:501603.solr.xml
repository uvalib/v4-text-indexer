      <field name="fulltext">London Heights Va. Sept. 30 th , 1862. My own loved Addie ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How do you do this beautiful morn= ing ? Didn't we have a splendid view of "the Sacred soil" at sunrise? (I mean "us fellows.") How I wish you had been here for about an hour. But then its of no use wishing, for you wouldn't come if the Rebs hadn't burned the bridge s on the B. &amp; O. R. R. above Martinsburg .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will think I am in good spirits this morning, will you not? I have reasons for being so, I can assure you, for it should be my duty to always rejoice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your most excellent and very interesting letter of the 22 d Saturday evening, and have been unable to reply until now, for you must know that even on London Heights there are military duties to be performed to the utter exclusion of private enjoyments, and sometimes to the extreme annoyance of " our dear selves ;" but Gen. Geary will not surrender Harper's Ferry as did Col. Miles . By the way, was not that the most disgraceful affair of the campaign? A soldier's death was the most fortunate thing that could possibly have happened to him. It certainly shielded his name from disgrace and dishonor. I trust a full examination will be made of the cases of White and Ford .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although Gen. Geary has returned and outranks Gen. Green — Night-hawk — 1 yet he does not take command of the division as he assumes command of the port at Harper'sFerry , and he is very active in putting everything in a healthy state, both for offensive and defensive operations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Night-hawk 2 ," since the battle of Antietam has been comparatively quiet, and in conse= quence , the boys have not been so fierce for "hitting him with a brick". He was very cool and collected on the field, and after we had driven the enemy across the bloody cornfield, he told our brigade he should remember "the Ohio boys for what we had done."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Bob Green " is as delicate as ever, and says "Pa, I cant drink my coffee without milk." On the field he rendered very efficient service, as aide-de-camp to his father.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While I am speaking of "Big- bugs", I may as well go the roun ds Uncle Abe is all right, having concluded that the slaves in the rebellious states after Jany. 1 st 1863, shall be forever free . This is the manifest destiny of slavery — that shrine to which so many thou= sands have knelt and paid homage. Its days are numbered, and America must be its sepulchre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Gen. M c Clellan is at Sharpsburg , and though the Government has not yet tendered its thanks to him, or hardly recognizes the late battles as a victory and a success to our arms, in ridding Maryland this summarily, he has faith in "God and the Good Cause," and that ere long the Nation will give "honor to whom honor is due." Few men labor under such disadvantages as does, and has Gen. M c Clellan . Devotion to his country seems to be his crime , which he must expiate on the scaffold of "political fanaticism", but thank Heaven, he is out of reach of the keener weapons of malice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now of that other " pop= ular individual,"— Chas. N. Tenney — I have only to say that he is well, and like some one else , is patiently waiting.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am very glad you consider Ohio and particularly Trumbull Co. safe from invasion, I have myself entertained very serious doubts as to the ability of the " Butternuts " to invade cross the " La belle Riviere ," and invade our beautiful Ohio .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been wondering what Gen. Lee's 's army of "ragamuffins" will say, and do, when they comprehend that a heavy force has cut off their direct communication with Richmond . I learn from various sources that a large force under Sigel and Heintzlerman has gone to Warrenton to destroy the communica= tions between the Valley and Richmond via the above place, Little Washington , Sperryville and Thornton's Gap . If successful, as I hope it will be, the expedition will make short work in Upper Virginia , and much sooner than the Rebs anticipate, our army will be thundering against the walls of the rebel Capital. Richmond once in our hands, and the cause of Secession is forever hopeless.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have rumors that England has recognized the independence of the Confederate States, but it produces no feeling beyond that of contempt, for our boys seem impressed with the belief that if England should be so imprudent as to commit such an act, that it would result in good for the Union cause rather than otherwise. For Canada would not long remain inactive, nor would Ireland .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have just reviewed this, and the idea has occurred to me that I may be too political in my letters, and that they may be not so interesting to you, as they otherwise might be. If so, my love, do not hesitate to tell me and I will not write in such a reportorial manner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As to your letters, darling, any letter from you is interesting and is very dear to me, and the longer they are the better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must close this now as I wish to write a line to Hal , and to send in to-day's mail. Write very soon to, Your true Charlie . Address- Co. H. 7 th Ohio Regt. 1 st Brig. , 2 d Div. , 12 th A.C. Washington, D. C.</field>
