Hal's friend Dwight Wilber is here. going to Cleveland with Hal tomorrow to enter the Law office consequently I must "expedite" Hal is not going in to the service again as recruiting was so difficult and he had no desire so to do.. The 8 th and 122 th have been consolidated.. Hal is going to enter the regular "Law school" and graduate next June.. So you see he is going to "shout right ahead" But this is not answering thy darling letter which I happily recieved last evening.

How could parents act so indifferently about--but hush Addie is not for you to censure- "God is just and every wrong shall die " Addie will not withold the fervent " God bless thee my Charlie " Joyful tears flowed that I had ever made thee happy. God helping me you never shall regert loving Addie And God will help me darling for I have asked him to . Are you so very happy dearest when you meditate upon my love? I have often wondered if ever mortal was so happy as I. but you seem to breathe my very thoughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I trust you have entirely recovered from your illness. It troubled me a good deal and I shall be very anxious to hear from you again. Pardon me dear but I feared you would not tell me just exactly how ill you were, I know it was a naughty thought but I--could not help it. You will forgive me dear?</field>
