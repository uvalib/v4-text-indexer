      <field name="fulltext">The plan of this tale is old, having suggested itself to the writer, many years since though the details are altogether of recent invention. The idea of associating seamen and savages, in the incidents that might be supposed characteristic of the Great Lakes, having been mentioned to a publisher, the latter obtained something like a pledge from the author, to carry out the design at some future day whose pledge is now tardily and imperfectly redeemed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The reader may recognize an old friend, under new circum stances in the principal character of this legend. If it should be found that his present the exhibition made of this old acquaintance, in the novel circumstances in which he appears, shall not lessen his favor with the public, it will be a a source of extreme gratification to the writer, since he has an interest in the individual in question, that fall little short of identity and reality. It is not an easy Task, however, to reproduce the same character in two separate works, and to maintain the peculiarities that are indispensable to identity, without incurring a risk of fatiguing the reader with seamen, and the present experiment has been so long delayed, from doubts of its success, quite as from doubts of its success, as from any other cause. In this, as in every New undertaking, it must be the "end" that will " crown the work."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Indian character has so little variety, that it has been an object to avoid dwelling in it too much, in the present occasion the association with the sailor too , it is feared, will be found too to have more novelty than interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It may strike the novice, as an anachronism, to place vessels on Ontario, in the middle of the eighteenth century, but in this particular facts will fully bear out all the licence of the fiction , in this particular . Although the particular precise vessels mention ed in these pages may never have existed on that water, or anywhere else, than so nearly resembling them as to form a sufficient authority for their introduction into a work of fiction , are known to have navigated that inland sea, even were found much earlier than the one just mentioned. It is a fact not generally remembered, though it may be well known, that there are isolated spots, along the line of the great lakes that date, as settlements, as far back, as many of the older American towns, and which were the seats of a species of civilization, long before the greater portions of even the older states was shielded from the wilderness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ontario, in our own times, has been the scene of important naval evolutions. Fleets have manoeuvred on those waters, which, half a century since, were as meandering, as waters well can be, and the day is not distant, when the whole of the great range of lakes will become the walk of empire, and fraught with all the interest of human society. A passing glimpse, even though it be in a work of fiction, of what that vast region so lately was, may help to make up the sum of knowledge by which alone, as just appreciation can be formed of the wonderful workings of means by which providence in this Review where Life so is clearing the way for the advancement of civilization across the whole American continent.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Brev. The turf shall be my fragrant shrine; My temple, Lord! That arch of thine; My censer's breath the mountain airs, And silent thoughts my only prayers. Moore</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The sublimity that is connected with vastness , is familiar to all every eye . The most abstruse, the most far-reaching, perhaps the most of the poet's thoughts, crowd on the mind imagination as he gazes into the depths of the illimitable voice; the expanse of the ocean is seldom seen by the novice, with indifference, and the mind, even in the obscurity of night, finds a parallel to that grandeur, which seems inseparable from images to which that the senses cannot measure compass . With feelings akin to this admiration and awe, the offspring of sublimity, were the different characters with which the scenery action of this tale must open, gazing on the scene before them. Four persons in all, two of each sex, they had managed to ascend a pile of trees, that had been uptorn by a tempest, to catch a view of the objects that surrounded them The wind-row, as It is still the practice of the country to call these spots, which by wind-row. By letting in the light of heaven upon the dark and damp recesses of the woods, they form a sort of order in the solemn obscurity of the native virgin forests of America. This The particular wind-row of which we are writing lay on the brow [EOF]</field>
