      <field name="fulltext">Farmington, Jan. 7th, 1863 My darling precious Charlie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Will you forgive me for allowing one whole week to by without writing to thee when I know how much pleasure it affors you. Do not think darling that I have been volunintarily silent- far from it. Every day I have thought that another should not find you neglected, but the next would come followed by its usual work, which must be performed, and finding one , to all appearances as far from writing to you as the day preceding. Today I have sat down regardless of etc. determined that I will neglect you no longer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not heard from you since you wrote me of your severe illness from which you had not recovered and naturally enough dread apprehensions fill my mind. Apprehensions that I dare not breathe. I a measure with the thought that if you were worse you would get some one to write me but I am fearful that you are worse and dred to let me know of it until you are better. If so darling one, let me entreat of you, as I often have done before and as you value any happi-ness, that you will inform me all about your health. I should so love to hear from you daily, aye, even hourly if could be, but I know the latter is impossible and the former nearly so. Nevertheless I would try and be content with hearing from you once a week if I could not hear from you oftener.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Forgive me dearest if my letter has the appearance of being dictated by a complaining hear; let me assure you that it is only my love for you that causes my anxiety.

      <field name="fulltext">I can no longer conceal from thee dear, the suffering I have been compelled to endure since learning of you illness. Darling, let me urge you to speedily come home if possible, If I only was permitted to fill the sacred office of watching by you I should be happy, but even that is denied me, and I must- what art thou writing, has he not enough to suffer without sharing thy grief? Hush your complaints.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The weather is cold and gloomy not a bright to be seen in the sky. A few snow flakes are stragging down as if fearful to tarry with us in this world of sorrow but then we need some gloomy weather, in order to fully appreciate the fair weather. weary I do get looking and seeing-what; Nothing but trees, ground covered snow, and dark frowning clouds. These all have a tendency to make me "bluer" than I otherwise should be. But- why I should, write so "bluish" to you is more than I can tell, I can not send this out till tomorrow so I will "lay it by" till evening. Good evening dearest, How art thou this cold evening. I trust your are not suffering from the cold even if we at the North do. I think I never "saw such sudden changes in the weather" as we have this winter. Yesterday morning when I arose it seemed more like a real refreshing spring morning, than like a morning in mid-winter. Every thing seemed so exhilarating, nothing seemed deficient except the joyous notes of the little birds, but towards the wind moved into the N.W. and today it has been very cold, so cold that as I breathe, little frosty particles collect</field>
