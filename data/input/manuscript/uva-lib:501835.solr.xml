      <field name="heading_text">From Edgar Allen Poe To Beverly Tucker December 1, 1835 Manuscript, University of Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond Dec: 1. 35. Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. White was so kind as to read me some portions of your letter to himself, dated Nov 29, and I feel compelled as much by gratitude for your many friendly expressions of interest on my behalf, as by a desire to make some little ex- planations , to answer, personally, the passages alluded to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And firstly — in relation to your own verses, that they are not poetry I will not allow, even when judging them by your own rules. A very cursory perusal enabled me, when I first saw them, to point out many instances of the you mention. Had I the lines before me now I would particularize them. But is there not a more lofty species of originality than originality of individual thoughts or individual passages? I doubt very much whether a composition may not even be full of original things, and still be pure imitation as a whole. On the other hand I have seen writings, devoid of any new thought, and frequently des- -titute of any new expression — writings which I could not help considering as full of creative power. But I have no wish to refine, and I dare say you have little desire that I should do so. What is , or what is not , poetry must not be told in a mere epistle. I sincerely think your lines excellent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The distinction you make between levity, and wit or humour (that which pro- -duces a smile) I perfectly understand, but that levity is unbecoming the chair of the critic, must be taken, I think, cum grano salis . Moreover – are you sure Jeffrey was never jocular or frivolous in his critical opinions? I think I can call to mind some instances of the purest grotesque in his Reviews — downright horse-laughter. Did you ever see a critique in Blackwood's Mag. upon an Epic Poem by a cockney tailor? Its chief witticisms were aimed not at the poem but at the goose, and bandy legs of the author, and the notice ended, after innumerable oddities in — "ha! ha! ha! — he! he! he! — hi! hi! hi! — ho! ho! ho! — hu! hu! hu"!. Yet it was without excep- -tion , the most annihilating, and most effective Review I remember to have read. Of course I do not mean to palliate such indecency. The reviewer should have been horse whipped. Still I cannot help thinking levity here was indispensible. Indeed how otherwise the subject could have been treated I do not perceive. To treat a tailor's Epic seriously, (and such an Epic too!) would have defeated the ends of the critic, in weakening his own authority by making himself ridiculous.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your opinion of "The M. S. Found in a Bottle" is just. The Tale was written some years ago, and was among the first I ever wrote. I have met with no one, with the exception of yourself &amp; P.P. Cooke of Winchester, whose judgement concerning these Tales I place any value upon. Generally, people praise extravagantly those of which I am ashamed, and pass in silence what I fancy to be praise worthy. The last tale I wrote was Morella and it was my best. When I write again I will write something better than Morella . At present, having no time upon my hands, from my editorial duties, I can write nothing worth reading. What articles I have published since Morella were all written some time ago. I mention this to account for the "mere physique" of the horrible which prevails in the "M.S. Found in a Bottle" . I do not think I would be guilty of a similar absurdity now . One or two words more of Egotism.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not entirely acquiesce in your strictures on the versification of my Drama. I find that versificaiton is a point on which, very frequently, persons who agree in all important particulars, differ very essentially. I do not remember to have known any two persons agree, thoroughly, about metre. I have been puzzled to assign a reason for this – but can find none more satisfactory than that music is a most indefinite conception. I have made prosody, in all languages which I have studied, a particular subject of inquiry. I have written many verses, and read more than you would be inclined to imagine. In short – I especially pride myself upon the accuracy of my ear – and have established the fact of its accu- -racy to my own satisfaction at least, by some odd chromatic experiments. I was therefore astonished to find you objecting to the melody of my lines. Had I the time just now, and were I not afraid of tiring you, I would like to dis- -cuss this point more fully. There is much room for speculation here. Your own verses (I remarked this upon first reading them, to Mr White) are absolutely fault- -less , if considered as "pure harmony" — I mean to speak technically — "without the in- tervention of any discords". I was formerly accustomed to write thus, and it would be an easy thing to convince you of the accuracy of my ear by writing such at present — but imperceptibly the love of these discords grew upon me as my love of music grew stronger, and I at length came to feel all the melody of Pope's later versification, and much of the present J. Moore. I should like to hear from you on this subject. The Dream was admitted solely thro' neccessity. I know not the author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In speaking of my mother you have touched a string to which my heart fully responds. To have known her is to be an object of great interest in my eyes. I myself never knew her — and never knew the affection of a father. Both died (as you may remember) within a few weeks of each other. I have many occasional dealings with Adversity — but the want of parental affection has been the heaviest of my trials.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would be proud if you would honor me frequently with your cri- -ticism . Believe me when I say that I value it . I would be gratified, also, if you write me in reply to this letter. It will assure me that you have excused my impertinence in addressing you without a previous acquaintance.</field>
