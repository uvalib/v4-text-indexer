      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Nov. 16 th 1862 My darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How much longer must I endure this dread- ful suspense. Almost three weeks have passed since I last received one of thy darling missives, Papa brought one home last night, from you for Hal . and you need not think but that I opened it. I should not have done it so but I wished so much to know how and where you was. It was written the 27 th of Oct. and directed to Camp Cleveland . J. P. Hurlburt took it from the office with the intention of bring- ing it to Mecca (He thought Hal was at home) but papa took it and brought it to me. I will send it to Hal immediately. As there is a very important question in it to which you ought to have received an answer long ago. You will forgive me for opening it will you not dear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hallie is now in Ann Arbor Mich. which is his address. I wrote you that he and Dwight Wilbur had gone to Cleveland . they did go there with the intention of entering the Law school, but Hal writes that they were disappointed in the institution and other things and concluded to go on to Ann Arbor . He will probably graduate in a few months.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well darling, Laurie is married and gone on their "tour" to Mr Thompsons friends in Columbianora county , and I know not when she will return. The were married in Warren at Camps Hotel last wednesday at half past three P.M. and started off immediately.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear sister, God grant that she may never regret the life she has taken. But I can not dwell on this subject without pain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My darling, pardon me but I am afraid your prophecies in regard to McClellan will never be realized. I was exceedingly sorry that our president saw fit to remove him- or at least I am sorry that he found it necessary to remove him He seems to have made an ignominious failure, but I do not think he would have done so had it not been for a few scheming politicians. Although many have charged him with treason long ago, yet my reply was that if Gen. McClellan was a traitor President Lincoln was also a traitor or an imbecile I do not think McClellan has always been as expedi- tious as he might have been, but where would you find the man that has moved with such caution Even the friendly face of the Chron- icle comes out in strong terms against him. But Charlie , listen to my prophesy, “As long as there is so much jealousy in regard to officers, our armies can never accomplish much.” Jealousy and political influences together have prolonged this war more than any thing else. It has kept some of our best and truest officers back and placed others in the situation that they ought to have occupied that are not much more fit for the position that I am Look at Banks and Mitchell two of our best men have 1 been kept back simply because politicians were afraid they would accomplish something The death of Mitchell is deeply lamented all over the northern states</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 But darling I have two more letters to write to day as you will pardon this short and imperfect one will you not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please write very soon will you not dear? If you I do not receive a letter this week I shall be strong tempted to write to some member of your co. and enquire of your health, &amp;c. Please remember me kindly to the boys and accept the prayers and love of your own</field>
