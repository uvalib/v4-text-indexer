      <field name="fulltext">Dear Friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After receiving your very welcome letter last evening, I seal myself to comply with your request to write you. Your letter gave some very plea sant feelings and again it some feelings amounting almost to pain. because I thought there was a little consider able,, of flattery min- gled with it. Perhaps if you had been in the room when I read your letter, you might have seen me indulge a very little in that feminine weakness of blushing for indeed I was surprised. There is always some thing so disgusting to flattery in any form and especially when it from those that I wish to call by the endering name of friend that for the moment it creates within my heart a strange sensation that is hard to conquer I do not say this as a reproof. but that I may be understood. you may not have meant it for flattery but I took it as such, so if you value my friendship please do avoid flattery in every form towards me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although our acquaintance has been very short it has been. to me, very pleasant. I shall ever rem em ber with feelings of gratitude your short visit at our home and I sincerely hope that sometime in the future it will be repeated. Thus it is with life. Today we form some agreeable and prof- itable acquaintance that perchance tomorrow may sever forever. When I think of this cast a gloom upon my feelings, that is hard to dispel. I have sometimes thought that I would form no more acquaintances. but a desire for sympathy obliges me to succumb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I opened your your letter, my eye rested upon the portrait of Col Elsworth. For a short time I sat spell bound. and gazed with admiration. then almost unconsciously I exclamed.—Oh! that he should die. and such a death. Cousin Jennie Case who was with me immediately sprang to my side and inquired what was the matter. thinking only of my brother Hallie or Brig. but when I showed her the portrait, she too was possessed with the same feelings. Me dear friend how shall I ever thank you for that portrait. there was nothing that I could have wished for more. but let us turn to something else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You spoke in very glowing terms of my borther. I can but thank you for in my opinion he merits it all</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You say that you dare not hope that I think more of you than a common friend. No, I do not. how could you expect me to, to be sure there are those I have known for years that I have no kinder feelings for them nor as kind as I have for you and have denied them the request that to you I granted still I wish for no nearer tie outside of my home. than a true and warm- hearted friends. perhaps you will ask me why it is if you do I will answer you. You also ask if I have objections to our changing ambrotypes? I most assuredly have. That was one of the sentences which gave me pain. You may think me a queer girl—but I have several reasons for refusing that request. one is this. our acquaintance has been very short. But do not think that I deem that a sufficient reason. far from it. If you had heard the low vulgar expressions I once heard uttered by a youth while gazing at a likeness of a pure minded noble girl. you would not wonder that I then made a vow to never let my portrait go into the hands of a gentleman when he was nothing more than a common friend. Do not imagine that I think you would be guilty of such a base act. no. never If I did Addie would be the wrong one to be writing to you now But that vow is made and cannot be broken. I think that where a gantleman and lady are engaged, then they should change portraits. for then it is a sacred gift but not till then. Now you have my reasons in full In your letter you spoke of that insurrection. and of your being the second man in line. It would do no good for me to praise you. but there was a feeling of pride kindled in my bosom when I read it. You asked if Laura knew that you corresponded with me? Yes she does there are but few things or secrets of mine that she does not know. she sends her respects to you and says tell him to always do what he knows to be right. Is not that godd advice? I understood that the 7 th had left Camp therefore I hardly know where to send this. But my letter is getting some what lengthy so I will close with the request to write soon (what a miserable pen this is) Yours in friendship</field>
