      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Edgar Allan Poe, The Court House Tavern, to John Allan [March 19, 1827] Manuscript, Valentine Museum, Richmond, Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond Monday Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After my treatment on yesterday and what passed between us this morning, I can hardly think you will be surprised at the contents of this letter. My determi- nation is at length taken to leave your house and endeavor to find some place in this wide world, where I will be treated—not as you have treated me— This is not a hurried determination, but one on which I have long considered—and having so considered my resolution is unalterable— You may perhaps think that I have flown off in a fashion, &amp; that I am already wishing to return; But not so—I will give you the reasons which have actuated me, and then judge—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since I have been able to think on any subject, my thoughts have aspired, and they have been taught by you to aspire to eminence in public life—this cannot be attained without a good Education, such a one I cannot obtain at a Primary school—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A collegiate Education therefore was what I most ardently desired, and I had been led to expect that it would at some future time be granted—but in a moment of caprice you have blasted my hope because forsooth I disagreed with you in an opinion, which opinion I was forced to express— Again, I have heard you say (when you little thought I was listening and therefore must have said it in earnest) that you had no affection for me—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You have moreover ordered me to quit your house, and are continually upbraiding me with eating the bread of Idleness, when you yourself were the only person to remedy the evil by placing me to some business—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You take delight in exposing me before those whom you think likely to advance my interest in this world—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You suffer me to be subjected to the whims &amp; caprice, not only of your white family, but the complete authority of the blacks—these griev- -ances I could not submit to; and I am gone I request that you will send me my trunks containing my clothes &amp; books—and if you still have the least affection for me, As the last call I shall make on your bounty To prevent the fulfillment of the Prediction you this morning expressed, send me as much money as will defray my the expences of my passage to some of the Northern cities &amp; then support me for one month, by which time I shall be enabled to place myself in some situation where I may not only obtain a livelihood, but lay by a sum which one day or another will support me at the university—Send my trunk &amp;c to the Court-house Tavern , send me I entreat you some money immediately—as I am in the greatest necessity—If you fail to comply with my request—I tremble for the consequence</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours &amp;c Edgar A Poe It depends upon yourself if hereafter you see or hear from me</field>
