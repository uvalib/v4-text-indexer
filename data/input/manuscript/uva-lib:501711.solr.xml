      <field name="fulltext">Nashville March 6, 1864 Dear Father;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am standing by a window here in the soldiers' home and the boys are just singing the Star-Spangled Banner. Long may it wave' You may be somewhat surprised at my delay in writing to you. me reason was that I couldn't give you the directions to write to me until now. So far I have enjoyed the very best of health. The boys are, I believe, all well, at least in Co. B. The weather here is quite warm. This southern sun shines in at this window this morning with the warmth of a mid-summers sun at the north, it looks to be at about the same altitude. The water we have here is not of the best quality, it is the water of the Cumberland River and is very nearly the color of clay. The Cumberland river is quite a stream, being navigable for the largest steamboats. The railroad bridges are on a swing, that is the boats come to it, it is made to separate in the middle and one-half swings to the side. We had the opportunity of seeing this on the evening of our arrival here from Louisville, Ky . A number of us boys went to a theatre, last night, in this place, it was the first that I have ever seen. I thought that I was well paid for my quarter. The principle play was Shakespeare's "Macbeth." I am of course no judge of theatres but I was well satisfied with what I saw and heard. The instrumental music was good 3 violins, harp, one clarinet, one brass instrument, I think a bugle &amp; Double Bass. You talk about singing and such like, but there was a girl here last night that I think would beat your Mrs. Sunderland decidedly. I expect that you have received by this time some money that I sent American Express Co. ($60) You may send me word that you received it, for if not, I have a certificate that insures its loss. I expect that we shall leave here tomorrow, probably for the front, Pulaski . We expected to go today, but some accident or another that happened yesterday between here and Chattanooga pre vented us . I am tired of stand ing and writing, so write to me as soon as possible &amp; direct to me Co. B 7 Reg. Iowa Vol. Pulaski Ten, care of Cap. Reiniger .</field>
