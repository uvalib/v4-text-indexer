      <field name="fulltext">On board Silver Lake Sept 24 th 1861 Dear Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your short but interesting note of the 10 th Hal gave me this morning. and I haste to reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wrote you last week that I I was on the Silver Lake as a guard with Leiut. Wood. we are still on board of her and bound to Gallipolis O. where I will mail this. The boat trembles so much from the working of her engines that it is almost impossible to write legably, however as the landlord said, "its our best accom- modations" and I will do as well as I can</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is a most beautiful day here, the trees and shrubs along the shore look as fresh and green as in June while a gentle breeze murmurs by and ripples the clear and beautiful waters of the Kanawha. The Kanawha Valley! I wish you could see it in its wild and picturesque beauty. I think it the most beautiful valley I ever saw, It seems almost sacrilege that pitiless war should seek to deform such beauty, but with a ruthless hand she seeks to destroy. We have just passed the black scorched timbers which alone remain of the once splendid steamer "Julia Maffit". When Wise first commenced his depredations in the Ka Vally he impressed the Julia Moffit into the Rebel service; and when Gen. Cox was in pursuit of "Wise's flying Brigade, Capt. Cotter who commanded an artillery company saw a boat bearing the Rebel flag coming up and at once turned one of his rifle cannon upon her and fired the first shot went crashing through her and all on board made for the shore not however till one more daring than the others, applied the incendiary torch and soon she was a smoking hulk. Oh! shall I be so gald when this cruel unholy war is ended. it seems so like killing friends. but in the language of the hoary traitor Wise himself, who said at the time of the John Brown raid, "Treason must be put down", and I could conscientiously shoot him and his associates Floyd and Lee like dogs. Don't think for a moment dear Addie because I say I am tired of war, that I am tired of supporting the glorious old Stars and Stripes on the contrary I would not accept a discharge if one was offered me until every ______ banner be trampled in the dust, and every traitor hung. Hal says when he comes home I must come with him. I have not yet decided whether to come or not. but I think now if I can get leave to come I may.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Can you explain what it is that binds me so closely to Hal? I really think more of him than my own brother. Surely never boasted a sister of a better brother. I feel far more interest in his welfare than in my own. The boys often ask me why it is that I think so much of Lieut. Case, Almost invariably my answer is, and it comes spontaneously -- "Why should not I? He is a brother to me". Is it any wonder that I like the sister while the brother is so good? "Brave and efficient, a very lion." Such are the _______ passed on Hal by members of the ______ who know him. Pardon me if I say I like you because you possess the good qualities of your brother for it is true -- and -- more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But my letter must be getting uninteresting if, indeed, it has been other wise so I will close.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please excuse this poor paper for it is all I could get, and the writing for the boat is in a continual tremor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write soon and often, even if you do not hear from me every week but i will write as often as possible</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Believe me Addie I remain Yours ever Charley P.S. I think somewhat of making my future home in Trumbull Co. What think you? I mean to make a man of myself. perhaps in Warren.</field>
