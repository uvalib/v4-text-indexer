      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Aug ;4— /29 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am unable to account for your not answering—if you are offended with me—I repeat that I have done nothing to deserve your displeasure If you doubt what I say &amp; think that I have ne— glected to use any exertions in the procuring my warrant—write yourself to M r Eaton &amp; he will tell you that more exertions could not have been—the app t might have been obtained for June if the application had been made 2 months sooner &amp; you will remember that I was under the impression that you were making exertions to obtain the situation for me, while I was at Old Point &amp; so situated as to be unable to use any exertions of my own—On returning home nothing had been done—it is therefore unjust to blame me for a failure, after using every endeavour, when success was impossible rendered so by your own delay—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you have not forgiven me for my former conduct—that is a different thing—but you told me that you had—I am however aware that I have many enemies at home who fancy it their interest to injure me in your estim— —ation—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">By your last letter I understood that it was not your wish that I shouuld return home—I am anxious to do so—but if you think that I should not—I only wish to know what course I shall pursue— If you are determined to do nothing more in my behalf—you will at least do me the common justice to tell me so— I am almost sure of getting the app t in Sep r &amp; certain at any rate of getting it in June. if I could manage until that time I would be no longer a trouble to you—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think it no more than right that you should answer my letter—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps the time may come when you will find that I have not deserved 1/2 the misfortunes which have happened to me &amp; that you suspected me unworthily</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am yours— Edgar A. Poe</field>
