      <field name="fulltext">Sir</field>
      <field name="fulltext">your letter of Monday was received this morning, I am not at all surprized at any step you may take, at any thing you can say, or any thing you may do, you are a much better judge of the propriety of your own conduct and general treatment of those who have had the charge of your infancy I have watched with parental solicitude &amp; affection over your tender years affording you such means of instruction as was in their power &amp; which was performed with pleasure until you became a much better judge of your own conduct, rights &amp; priviledges, than they, it is true: I taught you to aspire, even to eminence in Public Life, but I never expected that Don Quixotte . Gil Blas : Jo ; Miller &amp; such works were calculated to promote the end</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is true and you will not deny it, that the charge of eating the Bread of idleness, was to urge you to perseverance &amp; industry in receiving the classics, in perfecting yourself in the mathematics, mastering the French &amp;c.. &amp;c.. how far I succeeded in this you can best tell, but for one who had conceived so good an opinion of himself, this future instruction I hesitate not to say, that you have not evinced the smallest disposition to comply with my wishes, it is only on this subject I wish to be understood. your Heart will tell you if it is not made of Marble whether I have not had good reason to fear for you, in more ways than one. I should have been justly chargeable, in reprimanding you for faults had I had any other object than to correct them</field>
      <field name="fulltext">your list of grievances require no answer the world will reply to them—&amp; now that you have shaken off your dependance &amp; declared for your own Independance—&amp; after such a list of Black charges—you Tremble for the consequences unless I send you a supply of money</field>
