      <field name="fulltext">Section 2 I Dreamed of The Thy head was on my sholder leaning Thy hand in mine was gently pressed Thine eyes so soft and full of meaning Ware bent on me and I was blest No word was spoken all was feeling The silent transport of the heart The tear that over thy cheek was stealing Then told what could never impart And could this be a near delusion Could fancy all so real seem And fancys scenes but wild confusion And can it be I did but dream of the [thee] I'm sure I felt thy forehead pressing The Very Breath stole over my cheek I'm sure I saw those eyes confessing What tongue could never never speak Oh no tis gone and never never For me such waking joy may be But I could sleep would sleep forever Could I thus dream of thee I remain yours &amp;c W.
