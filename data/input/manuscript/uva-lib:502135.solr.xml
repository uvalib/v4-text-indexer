      <field name="fulltext">I recieved your kind &amp; interesting letter this morning and being on a resurved post I hasten to reply My health is very good &amp; hope this may find you enjoying the same. Evry thing is quiet along the lines our foes are quietly watching us from the north side of the Rapidan evry thing would betoken a friendly appearance if our Officers would allow us to trafick with the Yankees, a great many of our boys bought topacco for the purpose of trading for coffee; with all the yankee notions that might be brought forward for the exchange of the great southern weed your cousin Jimmie V has been complaining for some time he looks badly I came across him the other day in the woods lying down when I first came upon him I felt like kneeling down beside him &amp; raising him in my arms I stoped for about a minute &amp; looked at him &amp; then called him by name I asked him how he felt. he said about as usual was just suning him self a little you need not be in the least uneasy abut Jake no doubt he will write to say as he is left in camp well Kate Jake made me blush the other day by asking whare I was he was looking at me at the same time. Abe answering told him I was writing to his sis. Jake then said he suspicioned that then all the boys commenced laughing you may well now it was very hard to keep from blushing all the boys tease me a grate deal more since I come back than thay ever did before but I never mind them. I often tell them you said you had a grate deal of company since my return I am glad for I know you can always enjoy your self when in gay company I suppose you have been wandering whare I got my red ink. Our post is near a patch of Poakroads perries of which Brother John made the ink that I am now using I hope it may last longer than the marks of a lead pencil. I told John that Hettie sent her love to him he blushed and replied that he would hafto return the compliment Thare is none but &amp; myself in this post. we have a gay time John says he will not believe that H sent her respects to him unless I will let him read the letter he says he nows that Hettie is to backward to send her love to any one and says the blame must rest on you I obliged him a great deal about the blush on his cheek telling him that it was a hidden disease. I was in hopes that Charles was at home by this time I hope while he is an exile that he may be tamed I have never heard from sister since I returned to camp I am very ancious to hear from her I will write again to be sure that she may hear from me. oh Kate I have no news &amp; how am I to interrest you you said you had paid Kate a visit &amp; that you ware rather fearfull that Tom will not come; I hope he will for if he disapoints her She wil take it very hard if she should be so fortunate as to get married I hope you may be thare &amp; enjoy yourselves to the gratest advantage I think Mr Lee wil hardly let me of this time as I had such a long stay this summer. My toe is getting so that I can stand the truss very well The boys are mostly in fine spirits Jake is not very wil this morning but I think its nothing more than a slight bilious attack &amp; will be well in a day or two they just remind me of my duty to write to your cous; John B to get that ring finished &amp; return it to you Miss Kate Shields wil probably think that her ring is gone We have prayer meeting one night and preaching the next I believe the boy generally like our new chaplain the Rev. Mr. See. I think he is a good man &amp; a noble Preacher hope his efforts may be crowned with success your cous, He sends his respects to you oh yes Jim Campbell told me to tell you that he was going to strut in that confederate unaform that he is going to get of him I must bring this to a close by asking an interest in your prayers write soon as I am always ancious to hear from you I remain yours truly as ever.</field>
