      <field name="fulltext">I seat my self this morning for the purpose of dropping you a fiew lines to let you know whare I am. I have the Dipthera . My throat is very soar but I am in hopes that I will be well in a week or two. I left camp on the 24th thare had been but very little Infantry fighting but some heavy cannonnading across the river the enimy seemed to have the advantage in position at evry ford. We have a very large Army in Culpepper for Pope to contend with. Your Brother John was well when I left the Com. thay ware all in good spirits when I left. I met Jacob, Abe, &amp; Isack Vines on Monday. Jacob gave me a half Cheese. Abe told me he had something to tell me how he had fooled you out of some secrets. I be glad to se him &amp; find out what thay are. I seen John Plunkett in Gordonsville he told me that Charles had a letter for me I am sorry I did not meet him as he is so careless he may loose it before I get back this is a very mean hospital. Very little accommodations, nothing but bread &amp; meat to eat &amp; my throat being soar it is very hard to swallow. I wish I could come home and let Churchman tend on me a while evry thing is very dear around hear &amp; thare is but little change in the circulation. I have been trying to get a note Broke ever since I left the Regt . This is a very lonesome blase . Thare is nothing of importance to write I hope these fiew lines may find you enjoying both health &amp; happiness. I pray the God of mercies may soon visit me with health.</field>
