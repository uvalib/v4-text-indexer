      <field name="fulltext">Washington College Lexington Jan 23 1861 Dear Sister,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The time has again come round for me to write home. And it must be done to night or you will not get one this week. Because we have a little more spare time Wednesday night than any other, and precious little then, for in addition to our regular studies we have a poor chance to do for examinations; two of which we will have next week, Greek, Mathematics. [1]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are very well. The anniversary of the Graham Society [2] came off on last night. It was such a pleasant and beautiful moonlight that there was a large crowd. The anniversary address was delivered by Mr. Paxton of Rockbridge . [3] It was a very good address, well written and very well delivered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The question, "If Turkey fails to protect her Christians should nations interfere" was then discussed by four other members of Society, whose names it is not necessary to mention. All the front of the college was illuminated and made a very pretty appearance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The people of this county held a meeting at the Court house, Monday to nominate candidates for the convention which resulted in the nomi- nation of S McD Moore and James Dorman, two strong Union men, so that if the question of Virginia's secession depends upon their votes, she wont go out soon. Who are candidates in Augusta? [4]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From all I can hear, I think that the secessionists are rapidly gaining ground in Virginia, and would not be surprised if that convention should declare Virginia out of the Union. From present appearances it seems that we are almost sure to have civil war. There are such extensive military preparations going on in the north and from the threatening and insulting way in which the Republican papers and from the overbearing and contemptuous actions of Congress in refusing compromises giving the South the barest justice, it must be Lincoln's intention to compel the South to remain in the Union, if he can. And if he attempts that, the whole South will and ought to unite and oppose it. A week or two ago, a few of the boys secretly made and hoisted upon top of College a Disunion Flag, bearing a single red star and the word Disunion. But Dr. Junkin very soon had it taken down and there has been nothing said about disunion since. [5]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yesterday was warm and clear, but now it is cold and snowing. I never saw weather so changeable, or so much rain, or so many cloudy and foggy days in my life as we have had here. It is hardly ever clear three days at one time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have been looking for a letter from home for two or three days to tell us about the wedding, but haven't got one yet. You must think we don't want to hear! Does Uncle Andy look like he is married? [6]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Writing letters is the hardest work that I have to do at College and since there is nothing here that will interest you, and believing that I have done remarkably well in having written this much, I quit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Love to all, your brother A. Brooks</field>
