      <field name="fulltext">Richmond July 2 d 1862 Dr Sir:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I reached this place on Monday by Central RR , and though I have learned nothing with certain ty of Charles and John am satisfied they are unhurt in the great strugg le so far [1] . There is much difficulty in getting a pass and means of conveyance to the army and having procured the former should have gone to Jackso ns division to day , but for the heavy and constant rain that have been falling. I shall go tomorrow if poss ible . It is not possible to get a sub stitute in for Charles [2] until something decisive has taken place betweeen the contending armies, Jackson is move ing and fighting every dayâ€” this con stancy of action precludes the possib ility of getting in a substitute. The news from the army is of the most thrilling and complicated character; the enemy is still unbroken and formidable, and disputing every inch of our advance with the energy of despair. Our loss in killed and wounded is frightful. [3] It is re ported that Jackson was very seve rely cut up yesterday in an effort to storm the enemies batteries. He finally succeeded but at great loss. Our army commands the fla nk and rear of the enemy but the admirable order of the latter leaves it much to be feared that the crisis is yet to come. There has been no Bull Run on this awful field. It is quite a mistake to suppose McClelland yet whipped, the bloody catastrophe has yet to come. [4] You may expect to hear from me again as soon as I see the boys, and should it be necessary to telegr aph you I will do so. Mean while write me by return m mail if you wish me to remain until I can get a substitute received in the place of Charles . If I find any misfortune has bef allen him I will bring him home. I have not heard anything of Mr. Read with certainty no of Samuel Brooks . I hope to be able tomorrow to give you certain information with regards to them.</field>
