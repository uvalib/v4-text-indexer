      <field name="fulltext">Careysburg Interior Settlement August 19th 1857 Dr. James H. Minor Dr. Sir</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am pleased to acknowledge the recipt of you letter by the ship M. C. Stevens which arrived July last; and I learn that she has completed her voyage on this coast and now is lying in the port of Monrovia on her re turn trip home. And I am certain you will be pleased to hear from us, as no doubt you are anscious to know how we are — where we are — and how we are getting along. 1st We are all doing tolerable Well in health for there have been only a part of us sick with the fever; as for myself, I hav never had cause to lie down a day since here I have been, neither hav any of my family been sick — those who hav been sick did not suffer as much as was antis cipated and some of them caused their sickness by inadvertence in living &amp; otherwise. Dr We are all at Careysburg with the escception of Robinson Scott's family who are still at Clay Ashland, &amp; who I am sorry to say are much reduced — yet, I rather escpect the old lady will come here; but her son desires to buy land there with a small tenement on it at a cost of $100.00. How success ful he will be, I cannot tell. We have built mine log cabbins, and I am pleased to say that in our sisc months were up we were in them and pretty comfortably situated. All of us have our lots pretty well planted down in potatoes, cassada, eddoes, tomatoes, lima beans, some coffee trees set out &amp; other little articles which will do service in our families. Our boys I am happy to say have up to this time conducted themselves pretty honorably &amp; I hope their present good character will be their index through life with farther improvement for use fulness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I beg to call your attention to an Acct. due for lumber by some of our people whom I will name, for which they draw in favor of the A.C. society upon you and Mr Nelson the Escecutors which amount we are advised were not paid up to the time of the departure of the M. C. Stevens for Liberia The amts as far as I can collect just at this time are as follows: viz Young Barrett $20.00 Hugh Walker 50.00 Washington Coleman 10.00 Martin Coleman 15.00 C &amp; P Twine 25.00 Washington Michie 20.00 140.00 There are some amts of which I am not cognizant of just now: but a true bill will be forwarded you by the Finan cial Secretary of the Society, or in fact the draft drawn upon you &amp; Mr Nelson Escecutors will be presented for payment as the parties who are indebted no doubt attached their sword signaturs or marks to it</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am pleased to say, that the articles which you were kind enough to procure &amp; send us, &amp; for which we are thankful have been landed at Monrovia, and are being forwarded us evry week. We have all received portions of them, &amp; will receive the bal ance as soon as forwarded to the depot . You know we have no steam boats nor railroads in this Country &amp; business cannot be done with that escpedition as in other Countries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am sorry to acquaint you of the death of sister Mollie Michie, Patty Walker &amp; Sy phon Terrill which took place at Clay Ashland. Mollie Michie had got pretty well through with the fever but she at some greens which caused a complicated attack of sickness &amp; she died. I am pesuad to belive that the death of many were caused through their own impudence &amp; not going according to the Drs direction. If you re member when you were giving us flannel shirts you said that Charles Twine would be the first one to pull his off — and he was the first one according as you said.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Tell Mr Howe Lewis that his boy John had had the fever very bad at Clay Ashland &amp; found his way here — He imprudently over loaded his stomach with new rice po tatoes &amp; honey and died with the cholic My kind regards to Mr Howe Lewis &amp; the whole family. Give our love to all the Colored folks also to Mr Robert Lewis &amp; his family both white &amp; colored Mr Andrew Brown &amp; his family &amp; to My dear old aunt Rachel , and I am thankful to God that she is living — and I belive she is better off where she is for she is now too old to scuffle to make a living here. Tell her that all who professe religion as we learn from folks who died — died in the faith — and the others died so they lived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please write me all about your affairs &amp; matters general about home, I will write you by any chance Yours obdent Servant William Douglass</field>
