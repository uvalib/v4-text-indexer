      <field name="fulltext">Camp near the battlefield six miles South of Culpepper . Aug. 10 th 1862. Dear Old Friend Harry</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have poor facilities for wri ting , but must do the best I can. You will therefore excuse this roughly gotten up thing. I was ever so glad to hear from you and read your interesting let- ter , moreover that you were successful in getting the same old school to teach again. I hope your reputa tion in this profession is now established. I want you to keep me posted in school affairs, for although I am now a military man, I still take great interest in education- al subjects. I suppose you've heard of our battle. Our brigade however was not engaged, still we performed some exploits of which I must tell you. Banks whole corps fought them all Saturday afternoon, and were relieved by McDow ells corps in the evening after the infantry fighting was over the rebels as usual poured in upon Banks in overpow ering numbers, and why our ( McDowell's ) corps was not ordered up in time I cannot tell. The rebels were retreating however when Banks men were ordered to halt because he had not men enough to follow up what other wise would have proved a glorious victory. The papers will give you the particulars better than I can state them here. When we neared the battlefield late in the evening we met lots of our own wounded returning to Culpepper , where, our Chaplain told us the citizens treated them very kindly, the women assisting in dressing their wounds. We had been listening to the roar of artillery and could see the smoke of the battle all P.M. of Saturday, from our camp 1 mile south of the battle Culpepper , and when we saw the wounded, we felt like taking revenge. When we came within a mile and a half of the battle ground, our brigade was halted; our regiment received its mail here, and we fell to reading letters by can dlelight ; this drew the fire of a rebel battery, and some half dozen solid shot fell right in among us, wounding four men of our regiment. One ball fell about three yards from where I stood, we stood this like heroes for a short time, then we were ordered back a short distance, but advanced again til we came within 300 yards of the same battery which was firing upon us, and which with several others, had opened out again with the purpose of ascertaining our position as well as of the rest of the large number of McDowell's corps which had silently advance under cover of the dark, but they fired far above our heads, and we lay listening to the loud and crashing roar of the dogs of war in perfect safety. present- ly the battery belonging to our ( Duryee's ) brigade let loose upon the one which fired into the 107 th and silenced it. This de- railed their whole programme, and we could hear them falling back although in good order. Next morning we found two dismounted guns, 9 dead horses, and two Lieuts. killed, one having his head shot off. If we had not did this, they would have continued to kill us, while their infantry would have advanced, and perhaps have proved too strong for us then, as our main force only came in the next day. We have been watching the enemy ever since, yesterday they commenced retreating on account of Burnside getting in their rear, The reason we have not advanced upon them since our whole army is here is because they occupied a strong position on a high knoll. Abe got a letter from Pap which says 9 men from Corrstown , including Bro. Harry have enlisted in Reeds Co. Chambersburg . Bully for them. Its uncommonly warm here now. Soldiers live on secesh roasting cans . Cant get my picture taken now, No artist here.</field>
