      <field name="fulltext">Chambersburg May 17th, 1861 My good old Friend:â€”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been somewhat dis- appointed in not seeing you up here to see the men playing soldier, and now since Gov. Curtin is expected here tomorrow, (Saturday) I will feel sure that you are coming, and look for you, my but they do look pretty, Just come and see. Three Regiments were in yesterday afternoon and make a long line of people, who with their glittering bayonets under the rays of the shining sun, accompanied by their Bands, or marshal music, and the heavy and steady tramp of three thousand men, make all who stand and look on, feel, that they are not soldiers, all this can but give a very faint idea of the appearance of one hun- dred and fifty thousand human beings marched into the field of battle by the warming and thrilling sound of almost countless drums and Oh! what, or who can describe the feeling of that immense congregation of human souls when the sound of the booming cannon first disturbs the quiet of that breast and paints death and destruction all around. We may try to form some idea of the scene presented by a battlefield, both while in the actual contest and after, but can never, in my opinion, realize the horrors of such a sight until we ourselves behold it, and such; humanity forbids us from wishing. May it never be seen in our land, but may the Flag continue to wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aunt Lydia and Uncle Kyner spoke of coming to see the soldiers and as you no doubt will not object to having an errand there, you can tell them that saturday will no doubt be a suitable day as we expect all the soldiers in town while Curtin is here. I have been expecting to read your letter before this time, but suppose you are preparing to keep me reading one day when it comes, which I will gladly do. Mine to all inquiring friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours &amp;c Little Ellic Excuse this side as I thought I had it full. You can guess what is not written, now Good-bye.</field>
