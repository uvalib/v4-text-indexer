      <field name="fulltext">July 6 th 1866 Rose Dale My dear sweet brother</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your very dear letter several weeks ago &amp; can say some part of it made me very happy; I thake this leasure hour to respond but how must I respond not knowing whether my letters are welcome or not but hoping they are I will try &amp; interest you. My health is very good &amp; I must not murmer of my happiness for my dear Father only knows what I have borne; the chastning rod has been severe but I rejoise in Christ that he has been with me or this feble frame would have sunk beneath the rod. yes brother you no nothing when the last earthly friend forsakes you then &amp; not till then will you know (what) what this sis of yours has borne I have felt that I was like Jobe forsaken by all but thank God he has never forsook me I hope you will never know what it is to be forsaken by all for there is one that I dont think will ever forsake you no neve I will still remember thee . I hope ere this letter reaches you that you may be enjoying the best blessing that God ever bestowed on man &amp; that is religion for it is the cheaf unsorn of mortals here below &amp; our only sure happiness what would I have done if it had not been for it. cast down forsaken by all but God I ask what would I have done I know not. brother are you happy I ask the question I hope to get an answer from you personaly soon if you are not let me as a sister tell you where I fear you are rong you said in you letter you had heard reponse from old Ang ; that has cased you cheek to light up with anger dear bro do you think that is right for you to let that anger rise what does our bible teach us not to get angry at those that persecute us. let me here cast a verse or two. "Wherefore my beloved bro let evry man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath; for the wrath of man work Ah not the righteousness of God you must lay a side all such things &amp; recd with meekness the engrafted word will change any dear dear Willie if he has not which is abe to save your soul". note brother I do not think you have heard any thing compared to what I have heard but thank God it did not make me angry it made me pray for those that talked about me &amp; you &amp; treat them kindly &amp; I feel that God will help me to live right though my temptations are great do pray for me that I may be able to withstand all these trials.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You said in your letter that you knew that my concience did not reprove me for what I had done to you with out it was for loving you Oh Willie you are cruel to think that my concience (would) would reprove me for that which God has put in my heart did I not love another or have you forgotten; &amp; did I not pray to God to change me if it was his will &amp; how soon did the change come I do not remember of ever haveing one regret let alone reproof of conciense for loving you no I believe that it will all work together for our good I rejoice brother that I have more confidince in you this day than I have had for many month for God is able to change our enemys if we trust him &amp; I believe that he already I am resigned to his will what ere that be My concience never told me that I had done the rong but most evry person told me so &amp; I wrote to you to know if it was so &amp; you made no reply so I thought I would confess &amp; see if that (would) would clear me just so you dont blame me I care not for others. You say let the past be forgotten can you forget it I will join with you in improve the future; but are you we doing it I hear you have quit the distilery &amp; then I heard for a short time that you would go on if you had grain brother where is concience does not the cry of some poor little child cry for bread move your heart when you put that grain in the hopper to crush Ah perhaps that father has spent his wages this day for the liquor that you have sole &amp; that dear little one is crying for bread Oh dear brother cant I persuade you to to reflect for one moment if you can &amp; think then go on if you are going to improve the future commerce now not for my sake do I ask you to do it but for you own; now brother dont let this make your cheek flush with anger but forgive me if I do any do it with the best of motives for your future happiness. dear brother it greaves me very much to think that you came home &amp; did not come to see me but perhaps Walker did not tell you that I wished to see you I am very anxious to see you &amp; hope you will come at the reception of this letter I was told last Sabbeth by a friend that they thought you was afraid to meet me Oh Willie what have I done have I committed murder that any one should shun me or fear me &amp; especially the one that was once my best friend brother I think it would be best for us to meet the sooner the better cant you take time enough to spend a day or night I do ashure you I shant hurt you I will treat you as a sister would a brother &amp; I wish to have a talk with you not injure you or hurt you I will avoid evry thing that will go to hurt or wont in the least now dont let it be said that as brave a man as you have been is a fraid of a girl let me ask you to come for my sake as soon as you get this so that may not make people talk I have much to right but will wait &amp; tell you when you come I will tell you all about the infare when you you come please excuse all imperfections</field>
