      <field name="fulltext">Monrovia Liberia June the 2 1834 Dear friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I embrace this oppertunity to inform you that I am well hoping that these few lines will find you in and all yours in good helth it affords me adegree of Comfort that I have the oppertunity of conversing with you by way of paper and ink I have been in Africa almost Six months and I have not kept my bed one day at A time I had but A Slight tuch of the fever I have Chills now and then and also the fever with them the fever is not as hard in this Country as it is in the United States if you get it around here it is very hard to heal but I thank god that I have had none yet it is almost nedless for me to undertake to dis crib Africa to you I have Seen but little of it but this I can Say the more I See and the longe r I Stay the better I like it I am convinced in my owun own mind that all that is wanting is industry and good management and then we Shall be independant and can enjoy the comforts of life I visited A Town by the name of New Gorgia it is Settle d by the recaptured Africans by the name of Ebose and Congose they had not been in the United States long enough to learn to talk English if you Could See their town and their farms around it you would Say that any person that could not live in A A Africa ort to Starve I Seen three Crops all at one time on one peace of ground their was corn rice and Cosider and they all look as promising as I would wish to See them Swete potatos look as fine as any I ever Saw I must Say that I am afraid that our Country never will improve as it ort unti ll the people in the United States keep their Slaves that they have raised like as dum as horses at home and Send those here who will be A help to improve the Country as for Virginia as far as my knowledg extends I think She has Sent out the most Stupid Set of people in the place while they have them their the cow hide is hardly ever off of their backs and when they come here they feal So free that they walk about from morning till evening with out doing one Stroke of work by those means they become to Sufer people in the United States ort to have more regard for Liberia than to Send Such people here Some think that every thing grows by in this Country with out labour but they are mistaken I must Correct an error that I made in William Jackson's letter I Stated that every thing grew almost Spontanious in this Country I wish to be un derstood by that expresion that we need not labour half So hard here as in Some parts of the United States yet we can not live with out work their have com agrate many from North Carlina who are dregs in the place the most enterprising men that we have here is from Baltimo re and Charleton I can only Say that if the Coulard man had the Same oppertunity with the White man he would not be one Step behind him in no respect the their is not much Sickness in Liberia at this time god Still preserves our lives time would fail m with me to tell all that I have Seen and heard Since I left Buchanno n I often think about you the thousands of miles apart we have had Seet intercourse together on Buchannon and I feal in hopes if god Spares us we will See each other in the flesh I am now living in Call well imploid to assist in giving out provis ion and Selling goods in the mean time I am studing grammer and the arithmetic I want to get all the Learning that I can for with out it we can do but little both in temperl and Spirituel matters your assistance to me will never be forgotten by me while I move on the globe as it respects my religious enjoy ments I think I enjoy my Self as well as I ever have Since god Spoke peace to my Soul the more I See of the world the more I feal like Serving god as I n no that I have but afew days to live in the world I want to do all I can in god's service I feal that when god calls me from this world that it Shall be from the walls of Zion I have been trying to Blow the gospel trump ever since I landed in Africa I Still feal that god is with me god is reviveing his work in Caldwell I feal as if the time was not far distant till the Clangours of truth will be Sounded to the last green verg on erth when I look back to America and See how the people in Buchannon Stood in my way in trying to Serve god I fear that if they do not repent they will be Sorry in the morning of the resurrection I can appeal to god and Say I love all my old neighbours I want you to give my best love to your wife and tell her that I am Still trying to [illeg.] tell her not to forget me at athrone of grace Give my love to all the family tell your boys to improve their time in learning while young and when they grow up they will be glad that they Spent their time in gaining knowledg tell Betty likewise to get learning tell Lydia that I expect She has

that god called me to preach his gosple their is a large field opend for me and I intend to labour for god untill he Calls me from the world and then I hope to go whare the wicked Seas from trubling and the wared Soul be for ever at rest O Henry never sufer the vain and sorded things of this world to deprive you of the immortle crown [illeg.] that awaits the faithful at god's right hand Give my love to Mr Haselden tell him that the world has not got my hart yet I and I hope by the help of god that it never will get the advantage of me for their is nothing in it worthy of our affection give
