      <field name="fulltext">Camp Pine ridge, 7 miles from Tlyl Camp Tyler. My dear Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going to write you a funny letter, in the form of a Diary. hoping it will interest you, and to give you a slight notion, as to how we live while on an expidition of this kind</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March 2nd, 1862.-- We recieved orders yesterday morning at 4 A.M. to cook 3 days rations &amp; prepare to march at 7 oclock. We were ready at the specified time, but did not start, After "lying around loose," all day we left Camp Tyler. at 4. P.M. and started toward St Cucapon River. which we crossed about half past seven. The 8th Ohio had come in advance and built a bridge on which we crossed. This bridge is made of wagond, (13 in number) on the top of which were laid boards It is a very good way of bridging shallow streams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We immediately commenced ascending a mountain which we contunued about a mile, when near the summit, we halted. and camped for the night. Luckily, there were plenty of rails. so we kept warm After our usual cup of Coffee. we set about making our beds. This was accomplished by first laying large brush on the ground, covering them the tufts of pine pushed. This forming a good springy mattress, we next spread, a blaket down to lie upon. Taking off all outer clothing, covered with two good blankets and our overcoats we passed the night comfortable. "Tired Nature's sweet restorer, Balmy sleep," coming to our relief, we were soon in the lands of dreams. What is more pleasant than this? "Now when fair morn orient in heaven appeared</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Up rose" your honorable servant, and to breakfast went, after he prepared it, &amp; never tasted hard bread &amp; coffee sweeter. We are now waiting orders but I do not think we will move before evening, some of the boys are building huts of pine brush. intending to live as comfortable as possible, &amp; I must join them [squiggle] 10 Oclock, Just got the shanty done, and it moves very hard, it will serve to keep of part of the storm. Capt Asper has just just informed me of the illness of Gen. Lander: this has called caused the delay. We will not move on until he is better. My dinner is cooking. A dirk of soup, made of three pints of water, a piece of salt pork an inch square, some cracker (hard-bread) crumbs, and a little salt. Not exactly according to "Soyer's Rules," but palatable, if you cant get any thing else. 'Tis done, and I must eat it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">7.30 P.M. In camp. At 3 oclock, we recieved orders to fall in, and return to camp, at quarter past 3 we started. The road was very slippery, and difficult marching s but the march was made in good time, arriving here just at dark. When about a mile back, we were informed that Gen. Lander was dead. Hence our recall. He died sometimes today. As might be expected, every one is commenting, and predicting who will be our commander, some say- ing Rosecrans, some Farmont, others Sedgwick, Manks &amp; numerous others. For myself, I say nothing, becuase I know nothing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus you see it is, dear Addie, God disposes what man proposes, I supposed when I commenced this, that we were going to have a "scout," &amp; I was going to give you all of the particulars, Gen. Lauden's sudden death prevented us from going further. We will undoubt edly stay here some time. not, until we have a new Gen. Coming. I hope Tyler wont get the position. But I must close this "thing," as it is getting somewhat late. and I am rather tired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must write very often. don't I? Give my love to Hallie &amp; Laurie, &amp; tell Hal that I have not recieved a line from him since Feb 6th</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Believe me, my Addie, I am Your ever and devotedly Charlie . Camp Tyler. Ca. Mar 2nd 1862.</field>
