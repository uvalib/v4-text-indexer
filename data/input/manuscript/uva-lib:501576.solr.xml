      <field name="fulltext">Romney Va. Jany 1 st 1862 A happy New year to you, dear Addie , and my kindest wishes in your interest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How do you do, this beautiful day? Did you ever see such a beautiful new years day in your life? The day here is as pleasant as the most delightful day I ever saw in May. The main things wanted thought, to make me perfectly happy to-day, are, first a letter from my Addie . second Hal's recovery from his present indisposition. He has not been well for the past few days and last night he was some worse, but is, I trust, better this morning I hope he will soon be able to resume his duties. He is not so bad however, as to call in the Doctor yet, and I hope will not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not recieved but one letter since we left Charleston , and that one was sent to Charleston first. In it you spoke of not recieving a letter from me since Capt Asper returned. Have you not recieved any of the letters I have written? I sent one from Charleston , one from Parkersburg , one from Green Spring Run , and two from Romney together with a picture of "your's truly" I have been waiting for Wood to return hoping he would bring me some tidings from you, but he does not come, and as I went in and saw Hal , he asked me to write home and let you know he was unwell, so I add one more to the list of unanswered letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was on picket the other day and had a first rate time. I send you a hasty sketch of the headquarter of the outpost where I was stationed. The smaller part of the house took fire, in the night, and great excitement ensued in consequence. Many who were asleep supposed the rebels had attacked us, and were very much alarmed. There is a peculiar sort of excitement in standing on picket guard that I love One takes his post in the evening, banishes all though of comfort rest, and gives way to his own thoughts, all the time on the "qui vive" , expecting to hear the click of a gun lock, the step of an enemy, or, perchance, the discharge of a gun itself, summoning him to another world. The rustling of the breeze through the dry leaves, (for there is no snow) or the cry of some night bird calling for its mate makes him involuntarily get his gun in readiness to meet the expected foe. Some times it happens that inefficient men are placed on a dangerous post, as on the last night I stood. A man was placed on a post near mine, and towards daylight he fancied he saw a man, preparing to make a hostile movement: frightened nearly to death he drew up his musket and fired. An alarm was thus raised needlessly. In the morning, we visited the spot where the supposed had stood, when lo, a bush appeared, having seen it move he shot it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I made a sketch of some points of interest, intending to send them to you but while on picket the other day, they were stolen. Mr. Davis arrived safe did he not? Did you get the picture?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must bring this uninteresting letter to a "finis" . Do write soon dear Addie , for I am so lonesome Give my kind wishes to all, bid Laurie and Dora (when you see her) a happy new year for me, and please accept my love yourself</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours as ever Charlie I am perfectly well. &amp; trust you are too. Excuse poor writing. for I have a poor pen</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Charles N. Tenney to Adelaide E. Case, 1862 January 01</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Romney Va .; Happy New years., My dear friend;-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although I have once written to day, duty and my own inclination lead me to pen a few more scattered thoughts to my dearest, kindest, friend Addie Now, to speak truly, I feel more like myself to-night than this morning, for two reasons, which reasons, are the fulfillment of my two wishes expressed in my note of this morning orig .-- the reception of a letter from you and about Hal's getting better. He is some better tonight, though not well. The wind has been blowing very hard,all day, Page 2. and the tent kept flapping a making a very disagreable noi to Hal , consequently, a severe hea ache ensued, but the gale has in a measure subsided, and I trust a good night's rest will restore him to his wanted good health. But to turn to oth subjects. Have you passed a happy new-year's day? and did you thoughts revert once of to "Soldier boy" Charlie ? and wonder if he was engaged in some Bechanalian excesses? Thanks, Addie , for the question which sis- ter Laurie prompted you to ask me. You may inform her that Charlie never was intoxicated in his life, and furthermore, while at Summersville , I pledged myself to "touch not , 3 rd Page taste not, handle not the wine," or, in other words became a teetotaller. In making these assertions, I think I can be borne out in them by Co. H. and its officers. While on the subject[s] of domestic evils, let me remark that over two months ago, I eschewed the use of tobacco in any form, and while at Green Spring Run , I forswore the practice of playing cards. This I did for my own benefit and character hereafter. Is Addie satisfied with this statement? It is I believe the truth. Oh! the temptations of a soldier's life! How great the want of some restraining influence at home! "Home," Tears invol= untarily spring to my eyes as I utter that endearing word, and think. " I have no home ." But fate has decreed that one remains, not too proud to own an outcast soldier as a brother That you should find anything worthy a sister's love in my poor self, is a matter of wonder to me. How can I ever repay you for your kindness in noticing one so far below your happy position? But, do I wound you? Forgive me dear, kind sister, and I will endeav or to dispel the unpleasant state of mind, which has come over me in a few moments of bitter thought Would you know how the day has been passed by me? Well in the morning, after performing the usual routine, I called on Hal and was pained to learn that he had passed an ill night, after fulfilling his request to write home, I read "Guy Mannering" until Battalion drill, after which I returned to attend to the wants of my brother Hall where I now am and will remain tonight Geo. Moore is with me and requests me to give his respects to "the family," I suppose he has some one articular . By the bye George is a good boy and is a true man.</field>
