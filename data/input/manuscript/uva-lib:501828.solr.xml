      <field name="heading_text">Letter to Thomas White, July 20, 1835 Manuscript, Poe Museum, Richmond, Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore , July 20. 1835. My Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I duly rec d : both your letters (July 14 th &amp; 16 th ) together with the $20 dollars. I am indeed grieved to hear that your health has not been improved by your trip I agree with you in thinking that too close attention to business has been instrumental in causing your sickness:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I saw the Martinsburg Gazette by accident at Mr. Kennedy's — but he is now out of town, and will not be back till the fall, and I know not where to procure a copy of the paper. It merely spoke of the Messenger in general terms of commendation. Have you seen the "Young Men's Paper" — amid the N.Y. Evening Star ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As might be supposed I am highly gratified with Mr. Pleasants' notice and especially with Paulding's . 1 What Mr. Pleasants says in relation to the commencement of Hans Phaal is judicious. That part of the Tale is faulty indeed — so much so that I had often thought of re- -modelling it entirely. I will take care &amp; have the Letter in- -serted in all the Baltimore papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Herewith I send you a Baltimore Visiter of October 12 th 1833. It contains a highly complimentary letter from Mr. Kennedy , Mr. Latrobe , and Dr. Miller of Baltimore in relation to myself. 2 The Tales of the Folio Club have only been partially published as yet. Lionising 3 was one of them. If you would in any manner contrive to have this letter copied into any of the Richmond Papers it would greatly advance a particular object which I have in view. If you could find an excuse for printing it in the Messenger it would be still better. You might observe that as many contradictory opinions had been formed in relation to my Tales &amp; especially to Lionising you took the liberty of copying the Letter of the Baltimore Committee. One fact I would wish par- -ticularly noticed. The Visiter offered two Premiums — one for the best Tale &amp; one for the best Poem — both of which were awarded to me. The award was, however, altered and the Premium for Poetry awarded to the second best in consideration of my having obtained the higher Prize. This Mr. Kennedy &amp; Mr. Latrobe told me themselves. I know you will do me this favour if you can — the manner of doing it I leave altogether to yourself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have taken much pains to procure you the Ink. Only one person in Baltimore had it — and he not for sale. As a great favour I obtained a pound at the price of $1.50. It is mixed with Linseed oil prepared after a particular fashion which renders it expensive. I shall go down to the Steamboat as soon as I finish this letter, and if I get an opportunity of sending it I will do so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It gives me the greatest pain to hear that my Review will not appear in no 11. I cannot imagine what circumstances you allude to as preventing you from publishing. The Death of the Chief Justice, so far from rendering the review useless was the very thing to attract public notice to the Article. I really wish you would consider this matter more maturely and if possible insert it in No 11.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Look over Hans Phaal , and the Literary Notices by me in No 10. and see if you have not miscalculated the sum due me. There are 34 columns in all. Hans Phaal cost me nearly a fortnight hard labour and was written especially for the Messenger . I will not however sin so egregiously again in sending you a long article. I will confine myself to 3 or 4 pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Very sincerely yours. Edgar A. Poe</field>
