      <field name="fulltext">I have been intending to write to you on the subject of the University fire for some time, but my engagements in court lately have been very engrossing and I have not had the opportunity until now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The late fire at the University was the second one which has occurred since I left there in 1877. It surprises me that they did not have there the slightest semblance of a fire organization. The people present at the fire told me that the greatest trouble was the lack of a head. I understand that everybody was boss; that what one professor ordered another countermanded; and that this is really accountable for the failure to save the books.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I take the liberty of suggesting for the consideration of the Board that they organize some form of fire department. You have a superintendent there and, doubtless, at least a dozen servants, and they should be required to have a regular fire drill and some simple fire apparatus. If no other good were accomplished by it, it would at least have the advantage of putting somebody in charge at the fire and preventing interference by anybody else. The fire at the Medical Hall several years ago, it seems to me, ought to have taught them this, but, as apparently it has not, I 2. think the Board of Directors ought, as a guardian of the University, to move in the matter. I do not know a steamboat, a hotel, a wharf or a transfer company, or manufacturing plant around here which does not have an organization like this, and that although we have a splendid fire department here. Many a fire is taken in time and extinguished before the arrival of the department, or kept under such control that the efforts of the department are certain to be successful. How a great institution like the University, with its corps of permanent residents and employees, could have been all this time without something of the sort, passes my understanding. The superintendent during the fire, I understand, instead of taking charge and managing things according to some system, was chiefly engrossed in throwing dynamite at a structure that any engineer ought to have known would not be affected by it. The lack of such an organization among the authorities there, faculty and others, is so surprising that it almost looks like imbecility.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I say these things with great reluctance, as you know the place is not only full of personal friends, but relatives; but my love for the University is greater efen that these, and I therefore write to you making the suggestions for what they are worth. I rely on you, however, not to use my letter in any way which would cause me to lose any of the friends I have there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours truly, Robt. M. Hughes.</field>
