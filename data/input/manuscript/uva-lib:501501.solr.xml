      <field name="fulltext">Mecca January 19 th /61 Charlie , My Dear Brother -</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here comes another of my sunday letters will it be a welcome d guist . Maybe that you imagine I think the better the day the better the deed. I read your very very letter dear Charlie and was grieved by the feelings which were espressed in it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Will you think me presumptious. dear brother If if I ask you why your sister does not correspond with you? You must not answer me unless you deem it prudent so to do. but I should so</field>
      <field name="fulltext">love to win your confidence as a sister should or brothers confidence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have wondered often wondered why your sister did not write to you. It must indeed be a lonely life for a brother to have a sister that could not write to him Although I now sympathize with you. yet I can not offer my sympathy in the same form that I could if I knew the direct cause of your grief. Perhaps you will think me selfish in asking. it is not at all to be wondered at if I am, for I will own that I have a selfish disposition. I am not so blind to my faults but that I can see my selfishness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You still seem to have an idea that we have sleighing. why dear Charlie we do not. I guess sleighing either has gone to war or else gone where Mecca Oil has. Oh! such a winter as this is. One day very cold and the next warm. Yesterday</field>
      <field name="fulltext">morning there fell about three inches of snow and now there is not enough to snow-ball with while the streams look like (small) rivers. I wrote you of the illness of Sadie Hezlep . She is better. Dora came down to see me the afternoon of the day of which I wrote you last. She is such a good little girl.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie. how willingly would I take your position in this war if I could do so. how thankful I ought to be for having brothers and friends to go and protect our homes as I have but when I think of what may come it causes a trembling fear to take possession of my frame and I sometimes wish that my friends could stay with me. There is another instance of my selfishness. but some way it seems as if my friends were a great deal nearer and dearer to me then other people's friends were to them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close or the dark will catch my words and carry them to you sooner than the mail. I am well with the exception of a slight cold, which I think is contagious this winter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How is your health dear brother. Please write soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Affectionately your sister ever, Addie Please excuse all mistakes &amp;c</field>
