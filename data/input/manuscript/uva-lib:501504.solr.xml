      <field name="fulltext">Shall I offer an apology for writing none that I am at school no pen or ink and being likewise I should have written before and oftener, but that I to advice of my brother before corresponding regularly with you. You may thing me foolish in relying upon the advice of Hallie but I feel safe in for I that I am govorned by the noblest and bravest brother that a sister ever dare of</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How did you enjoy the fight you must have felt somewhat proud in to quell so superior a force I presume if I had been there my heart would have trembled for your safety. I was almost surprised not to have recieved a letter from you immediately after the fight. I felt very an[x]ious to hear and we did not recieve a letter from Hal. until yesterday. In fact his death came in the papers. It was soon contradicted but suspense is almost as bad as reality Charley if you have written to me lately I have not recieved your letter I recieved an engraving of Camp Dennison which I prize very much and also which I supposed came from you. I have not written you but one letter since you lef[t] for the reason that I have given above. My thoughts are scattered far and wide today so if my letter is rather abrupt you will excuse it I will send this in a letter to Hallie as I anticipate it will go more if you can write immediately after recieving this please do so</field>
