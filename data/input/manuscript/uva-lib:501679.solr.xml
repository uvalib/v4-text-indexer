      <field name="fulltext">Greenville Va Oct 28th/64 My Dear Friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved your truly wellcomed letter last Monday eav- My friend J brought it out to me I have not had a chance to talk with him yet. He is look ing quite well, he is fearfull the Provost gard will be troub ling him before long. I hope they will let him remain at home untill I get able to ride around with him, I wish Ano would get that provoking card about Staunton to let him alone, for I suppose She knows as well as I know that he is not able for duty yet. I saw Miſs Lottie the other day She looked as nice as the first roses of Spring. But alas I stand a poor chance since brother J. came home, He seems to be the beau idle of all the ladies, well my D— I suppose such as the above will not in terrest you as you will be ancious to hear how I am getting along, My health is ery good &amp; my wound is doing very well. I hav'nt suffered by very little yet. It only hurst me when I attempt to hopp about. Know dou bt you will think me very unfor tunate or lucky in getting home so often with flesh wounds, The Battle of the ninteenth was hard &amp; bloody. Up to the time that I was wounded victory was entirly in our favor. We had captured almost evry thing the enimy had, but I have understood late in the eavning thay ware reinforced by the 6 corps &amp; our army suffered another stampe- de Our poor unfortunate Comp suffered heavily, went into the fight with twelve men, had two killed &amp; four wounded one of the latter since died. I suppose you have hurd all the casualties Mr Heizer died at MtJackson before his Father got thare. You Uncle Burks would have me to come down &amp; stay a few days with them so that I could be near the Docter if I should need any medical treatment with my wound, It is a worse wound than my other an disables me more in getting about, but I hope by nice treatment that I will be able for duty in forty or fifty days. I went to see your cousin L while I was in Stanton. She introduced me to Cen mer. He"&gt;Mr Cen mer he is a very nice young man. L tried to ri g me about him but I think she failed in her attempt, de'st Kate I would like very much to see you I know I could talk much better than I can write I expect to go home tomorrow eavning if brother J comes after me. I have been watching the road for you &amp; A n but I suppose you ware just talking. I think I will be able to get about in a couple of weeks if I have luck. Then I am sure I will not delay in coming to see my little bird. I am so glad you are enjoying good health. hope the roses may continue to gather on your cheeks. br evry person said I looked like ha I had been sick when I came home. hard marching had pulled me down a greateal. but I think know I will soon way a hundred &amp; sixty. I am glad you have hurd from your brother Hope he may be kindly treated &amp; soon return home. I must soon close write soon as I will be glad to hear from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May a great &amp; good God protect you is the prayer of your devoted fr William</field>
