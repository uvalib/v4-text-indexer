      <field name="fulltext">Richmond Oct 28, 1895 Dear Frank,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yesterday was truly a day of days; of sympathi- zing sorrow &amp; overwhelming sadness with us all. Besides the terrific blow that fell on dear Robert Stiles in the death of his daughter Lelia, who died in the morning at 8 o'clock, there next came upon us the crushing news that the dear old University was in flames and doubtless doomed to destruction! I need not attempt to describe our misery and anxiety. All day long was spent in eagerness, &amp; melancholy, about the University's fate. I hardly have ever known more excite- ment in our Community, and as the day wore on &amp; the news became sadder &amp; sadder, we felt as if the loss of the beloved old Rotunda and Public Hall, with its priceless contents, would be felt as the most irreparable of disasters, and saddest of blows. I thought of you very often &amp; those invaluable treasures; and especially of your lecture- room &amp; its apparatus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To you and Peters and Mr. Holmes did my heart go forth,â€” and to Venable and Thornton and all of you, and to all the circle of life-long friends in the familiar walks where it has been so frequently my privilege to resort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carrie and Willie and Eugene were (with me) in deepest sympathy &amp; sorrow with the University, and its Professors &amp; all the neighbors &amp; friends of the Institution. I hope &amp; pray that the heavy ca- lamity may soon be as far as possible repaired.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We hope &amp; expect to visit "Copeley" as usual say about Nov 10th to 12th, and to see you then &amp; there. Kind regards to your good wife &amp; family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In great haste Yrs. truly sincerely James Pleasants Prof. F. H. Smith Univ. Of Va.</field>
