      <field name="fulltext">Mecca. October 4 th 1862 My darling Charley</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where do you guess I am to day. Do you remember of Hal. taking your glass--when you was home, over a year ago, looking down south. and trying to "shake hands with Uncle" as you then said? I am at said uncle's house.. Why. do you ask? I will tell you. Aunt Sarah is in Oberlin. spending a few weeks, and cousin Mary. or Mamie. as we call her was left to "keep house" Mamie's health not being very good and she not knowing very well how to discharge the duties incumbent upon her.--as she is not thirteen years of age yet--Uncle wished me to come and "kinder of oversee her in baking bread takin' care of the pickles &amp;c." So you see instead of a "school-ma'am," I am now. "maid of all work. Are'nt you sorry that you are not of the opinion of Homer Powers? But of course you do not know him. so I must enligten you. When I tell you that I once heard him say that he could not ever respect a woman. who could act in the capacity of both housekeeper and lady. you will have learned [rest of scan damaged] could I say. Were I to speak the truth--as of course I must-- I should tell you that if you are are not so large a [piece or price]. as Uncle Sam appears to be, yet the love that belongs to you is far stronger than all that Uncle Sam has, But you are a privileged character darling so you will not scold me for not loving my country enough will you? Remember that love for my country is paramount to every thing but God and you dearest. But do not think darling that because I love you so dearly I would have you shirk from your duty . No. no. love. Although danger may surround you uet if God wills it my love and prayers shall be an armor to guard you through this strug= =gle in safety. May God bless you dearest and give you strength to discharge your duty as faithfully as you have heretofore. I am not the only one one who gazes with such proud rapture upon that little band-- the noble seventh . Knowing as we do how true they have always been in every engage= =ment it is no wonder that we look forward with so much confidence when we know that our noble seventh is to participate. and of what proud emotions swell our hearts when we read "Another glorious virtory" "The gallant Seventh Ohio again distinguished iteslf" Pen can not describe the feelings of my heart when I read such sentences for I know one at least in of that little band who would never never falter. Is it any wonder Charlie that I love you so proudly? Uncle is now reading aloud the details of the battle of Sharpsburg Often he is obliged to cease reading and wipe away the great tear-drops that will flow in sympathy for the faithful fallen, WHat a man is Gen. Hooker. how indispendable were his services on the dreadful field And yet he was wounded. You ask if the obscurity has been removed at all within the past 10 days. Much, very much. McClellans victories have changed the aspect of things entirely. As you phrophesied, people are even more enthusiastic over McClellan and wildly shouting " He is the man for the times " By the tone of our letters I see that John Pope is no favorite of yours. also McDowell. I do not like McDowell but I believe Pope did the best he could under the circum stances. [T] o what was his defeat attributed There seems to have been some misunderstanding or else treachery. Can you give me any light upon the subject for it is to me the most unconvincible mess I ever heard of before. I should judge that your culinary department were not very extensive. Only three pints of water for two! I believe I shoud enter a protest against such scarcity. Who is your "partner" Would'nt I laugh to see you cooking your breakfast or "preparing Say Charlie, who takes the head of the table where you live, Which do you wait upon first ladies or gentlemen But</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Brave boys are they Gone at their countries call &amp;c."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">so I must not laugh at you, By the way dearest did you ever hear the song "Brave boys are they? If so do you not think it splendid? The first time I heard of it I could not listen to all the song it came so near home Miss Carrie Hib[l?]bee played and sang it for me and I had to request her to cease playing.
