      <field name="fulltext">Mecca October 12n 1861 My Dear Friend</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Are your thoughts</field>
      <field name="fulltext">wandering afar off to some absent friend, this cold and cloudy sabbath, wonderind why she does not write? I imagine that your thoughts are such, and therefore I will try to relieve your mind I recievid your welcome [?] letter written at Charleston last wendesday. We also read one from Hal the same day How very dull Mecca is this fall. I can scarcely con tent myself. But I this ugly war will not last long for it causes many very many lonely hearts stories in M. as well as at other places Your inquires of James Beebe to Stephen Bishop . Mr Beebe has gone to York State . He is not liked out of Camp much better than in, as for myself I can scarcely tolerate his presence I almost avoid him with a feeling of strong antipathy (but of course would not express my feelings this plainly to all and ought I to you As for Mr. B. I am not much acquainted with him. I have also heard that he did not care for his family. There has been a rumor that he was shot on picket duty but have not heard the particu lars. Dora sits here. I neglected to tell you that I am at her home, a pleasant, precise smile lighting up her countenance and as good as ever Charley if you knew her, you could not help but love her. she is a dangerous little girl around heart. If it were not for her I would be very lonesome indeed. The clouds have been threatening rain for the past three days, and what makes it still more aggravating it seems to be as far off as at first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When is Hal coming home, or do you not know when he comes of course you will accompany him</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, Charlie I had such a sweet dream last night of vision passed before my eyes so real with such dreamy blue eyes, when I essayed to clasp with a vainly-eager longing the vision, it departed, I awoke and with bitter tears at its departing as I would to see that face vanish from reality. Can you tell what that vision indicated</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You wrote of the conduct of your sister and ask what I would do. Why Charlie I am not acquainted with the feelings exhibiting between your the members of your family. It must be a sorrowing and chilling thoug[ht] that your sister does not care for you. But dear friend conduct your-self as your honest heart prompts you and if she does not love you, she must be hard hearted indeed[.] Best perhaps you will call me presumptious[.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How is Seth. Coon. He is in the seventh. Regt. yet is he not. His brother Chaun.</field>
