      <field name="fulltext">Mecca. Oct,, 25 th 1862.. My darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shall I try and interest you for a few moments. this rainy evening? But I shall not commence my letter quite so “stylish” as was my darling's last. even if I am a Colonel's sister. I shall not give myself that little, until I know whether I have a right to it or not.. for Hal . is rather dubious about his being able to get men enough for his regiment. So many have been drafted, and although Gov.. Tod. has given drafted men permission to enlist for three years, yet the most of them think nine months is not so long a period as three years.. For my part. I am not very particular about his going into the service again. for we all want him at home. True. I know that our old Uncle Sam wants just such men as my brother — Hal. B.. Case but Addie &amp; Laura want him too.. We want Charlie also very much. but darling, can we have him for a little while this coming winter? I fear the answer will be this “No Addie you must wait patiently still a little longer, thy Charlie is too useful to be spared yet” Have I not waited very patiently and oh. how long for thy return my darling? So you was rejoiced, and congratulate. Hal on his “good fortune” do you dear? Well as your congratulations came through my letter. I suppose it becomes me to thank you, which I heartily do.. I could inform Lt. Col. Asper that the military committee did not have very much to do about selecting Case “after he had that rupture with Tyler .” It was Gov.. Tods own offer.. Hal. at first declined and even now says he is willing but not anxious to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I fear dearest that your “mansion” which you erected was not very beneficial, for you wrote me that you had moved your camp. You could not move that also could you? Altogether I am sorry for those “three U.S. privates” who labored so hard, and one who was too busy to write to his Addie — but Adelaide , hush! you promised not to scold him even if he does not write so often — Darling. that is the way any little prompter — conscience I guess — talks to me when ever I begin to write any thing naughty. Are'nt you glad of it? I am for there is not a person in this world I would mind half as so soon as I would Conscience.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thank you very much dearest for your liberal statement of Gen. Pope . I can now comprehend how he was so easily outflanked</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How can anyone help condemning him for neglecting to post his pickets every where where there was an opportunity for the rebels to outflank him. I could not yet the correct statement before though I had earnestly tried, and I concluded to write to some one who knew,, Hence my inqui- ring of you..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You wrote that it was said you remained there this winter. No certain- ty about it is there? (Do you know what is coming?) If you remain there will you not try to obtain a furlough and come to Addie ? I should be so very happy. There was a letter in our last Chronicle from (my) (is it?) Julius which is highly interesting. &amp; at least to one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But darling you will excuse me from writing very long to night. will you not? I am quite tired. Mother has not entirely recovered from her late illness, and “discharging duties” gives me “tired” for a companion,, Hal . came home Thursday night but went to Barmington this afternoon to spend thes sabbath I will close now and play. “ Brave boys are they for you and bid you good night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please write very soon and often to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your affectionate Addie Love to all etc,,</field>
