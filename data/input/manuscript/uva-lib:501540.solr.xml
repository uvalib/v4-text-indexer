      <field name="fulltext">My school room May 26 th 1862. Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My school room is unoccupied with the exception of one lonely being and how thankful she is to obtain that solitude for which she has all day wished, But is it right for her to be alone? Alone to those torturing thoughts which cling to her sleeping or waking. and which nothing but a letter from that idolized being can drive away? Oh Charlie! My own loved one. if it is in your power. why do you not break the silence between us Three long lingering weeks have passed since last I heard from you and God only know how much longer time will pass before I shall. Are you ill darling and not able to write. If so why not let me know. I could bear that Or - Oh. no I will never write that thought, If I did I should feel every letter sinking into my heart. as if written with a pen of fire, Ah! those tears thank heaven for them,, But they are but few to what I have shed over my dreams. The thoughts while waking are not enough to torture my poor heart but dreams. frightful dreams! Oh I can not think of them, If the cruel monster Death - My God must I write it - has done his work. why do I not know it for then yes then. I might die. Die! Ah. what is death to this fearful suspense. It is nought. And then I might meet my idol, Here again I am thinking that it must be so. just as my dreams picture to me. and not only thinking but writing it, Is this madness ? or is it caused by short And yet at times sharp pain around my heart</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My own precious friend why do you not come home or else write. would that you could experience for one moment the anguish which I do. But not no, not for one moment would I wish it. I would spare you that my darling. But I must stop and seek society or I shall go mad. May heaven grant tonight that boon I so much crave - a word from Charlie. or I could almost say - death,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Morning 27 th .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling Charlie. I fear you will be frightened when you read this. I felt very melancholly last eve when I wrote this above. and even now do not feel much better, but “I live in hope” Ah! that blessed word “Hope” How many poor mortals would have been driven to desperation did not Hope whisper to them so tenderly, Dearest can you tell why I am not happy? I ought to be had I not? At times darling, I am very very lonely. although so much beauty and loveliness surround me yet I can not banish my fears caused by this silence. While in company I can appear happy, but ohi that pain in my heart. Night after night I recieve the same answer. “No letter for you” and turn to hide the tears that will come, and then so anxiously wait watch and pray only to be disappointed. Charlie I came to my school room this morning with the determination that I would finish this in a more cheerful mood than I commenced it but I believe I am incapable of doing it Would you like to know how my school is progressing ? I have now thirty scholars, and a pleasanter school I could not wish for, Charlie I do not flatter myself one bit when I say. I have not a scholar that would willingly disregard my slightest wish. for I know I have not, I sometimes wonder how they came to love me so, You remember what you wrote me before my school commenced that if my experience could be like yours I would find the bitter with the sweet. I guess mine is not like yours darling. for as yet but little of the bitter has been found, Teaching. so far has been a very pleasant employment and I am now teaching the fourth week. Time flies swiftly while I am in the school room. I would like to have you visit my school this summer, wish you could see me now sitting here no one near. for it is yet scarcely eight o'clock. writing very busily while at my right hand lies my Bible. I have been reading in it darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How much I am in need of that wisdom and strength so clearly spoken of in that blessed Book, How soon shall I recieve it. I do not know. But it is time to call school, Bless you a thousand times my own darling. Ashley Armstrong has just handed me two letters in the well know hand writing of my Charlie. I will read them and answer to night</field>
