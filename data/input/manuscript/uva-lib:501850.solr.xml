      <field name="fulltext">West Point June 28 th Dear Pa,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I take the very first opportunity which I have had since arriving here of acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 21 st May inclosing a U. S. note for $20 I received it 3 days ago -it had been lying some time in the W.P. food office where it was forwarded from Balt o by Henry [1] . As to what you say about the books &amp;c I have taken nothing except what I considered my own property.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon arriving here I delivered my letters of recommm n &amp; was very politely received by Cap n Hitchcock &amp; Mr. Ross. The examination for admission is just over -a great many cadets of good family &amp;c have been rejected as deficient. Among these was Peyton Giles son of the Governor - James D. Brown , son of Jas Brown Jr. has also been dismissed for defiency after staying here 3 years. I find that I will possess many advantages &amp; shall endeavor to improve them. Of 130 cadets appointed every year only 30 or 35 ever graduate -the rest being dismissed for bad conduct or deficiency the regulations are rigid in the extreme.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please present my respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs Jas. Galt , Miss Valentine &amp; Miss Carter .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain respectfully &amp; truly yours Edgar A Poe I will be much pleased if you will answer this letter. I am in camp at present -my tent mates are Read &amp; Henderson (nephew of Major Eaton ) &amp; Stockton of Phil a .</field>
