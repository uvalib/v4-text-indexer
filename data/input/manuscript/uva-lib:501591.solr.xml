      <field name="fulltext">Camp Shields Va. March 21st 62 My darling;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Imagine, if you can my joyful surprise, on arriving in from Strasburg, Pa- was the fact of my having four letters. "In luck", said I upon opening them I found three good long letters from Addie two notes from Laurie and one good letter from Gail. "It never rains, but pours" is an old adage, and if true, I may expect some other good fortune soon, I am at a loss to know how to answer your triple favor, and my perplexity increases when I note the multitudinous(horrors! what a long word!)subjects to write about. I guess I will confine myself to writing that which contains no public interest reserving that for the "Chron". Firstly the "grand move" is much followed up, and is nearly at a "level", and notwithstanding the 7th was included, we are all safe . My health is excel lent and trust it will continue so. Gen. Shields with his entire command moved on the 18th toward Strasburg. Ha ha! Aint I fortunate? Moore just came in with the mail, and two more letters came for " Chas N. Tenney."/ from the other from N. J. Braden of Gustavus</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But to resume– arriving at Cedar Creek. 1 1/4 miles beyond Middletown, a slight skirmish took place and the enemy retreated, burning the bridge. In the morning, we formed a floating bridge, (this artillery and cavalry finding) and advanced to Strasburg 3 miles distant. Our Reg with the Cavalry were sent out to skirmish.– We had the exquisite pleasure of listening to the rebel arty and witnessing the shells burst. (I will tell all in Chron) There is some thing exciting in witnessing a bombardment. particularly when you are among those being shelled . You look anxiously at the concealed battery, and lo! A puff of white smoke— you listen breathlessly—a stunning report, and the shell comes fiercely shrieking through the air—you cannnot see it, but you follow by the sound it is directly over you—whizzing—a puff of dense smoke an explosion and the fragments come screaming in every direction on their message of death.—a few seconds and all is over.—you are waiting the next discharge. I was surprised on seeing such coolness evinced by our men, while those of the 5th. near us, dodged at every discharge. It furnished much amusement for our boys. they have often boasted of their bravery and coolness .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We remained at Strasburg over night having chased the enemy some five miles beyond. The next day we returned to camp.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Charles N. Tenney to Adelaide E. Case, 28 March 1862</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March 28th 1862</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite a long period has elapsedd since I commenced this during which I have dispatched you a harty note apprising you of my saftey and I resume the task of answering your four letters (for I received one since the 21st—the 24th ) Did I say task ? I am wrong, for it is no task to write to her I love better than myself, and I wrong my self when I write it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let me see, when shall I commence? Do the best I can, I must speak of your last letter How charming, and so refreshing—coming from "Maple Grove". two full sheets full of confidence, love, and sense. Not but all of your letters are so, but after such horrible battle scenes as I witnessed , your sweet words were so soothing. How much I prize your letters! Then—the good news that your Papa bid you be happy in my love! Addie, have I not much to make me happy? God being my helper, I will never give you cause to regret having loved the humble Charlie Tenney. May God help you dearest</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not allow my protracted absence to mar your happiness Addie, for you know I was not to come until July and then if it is possible , you may be sure. I will hold Lieut. Brisbine to his promise. And you must not pay too much attention to Telegraph reports, for you know they are seldom correct, then you know when it is possible, I shall write very often, and keep you "posted." I have not yet received another letter from Mrs. Holcumb and I am not anxious to receive one either—only I would like to have her know that my intentions were honorable. If you do not wish me to, I will not send you any more of her letters but I will send them to Neal—and if you wish you can read them. Of course I have no objection to your writing any one you wish. nor do I wish to see you their letters. so remember I love Addie– not to find fault, for I can trust the one I love. I am glad you remember me often. not an hour passes but I invoke the blessings of Heaven upon you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You request me to wait on your consent to become mine however repugnant it is for me to wait . I will do so–only you will not allow too long a time to elapse before you speak of it again will you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You mention my sister, and request to know more of her. I will only say she does not very much resemble me– in looks as well as disposition.—She is beautiful—very beautiful, and proud. I will tell you all about her when I come home You must have an exalted idea of my abilities, indeed ha! ha! But you must not feel that I wish to exercise any power over you I only wish you to return my love, as I love.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Have you seen the order relating to soldiers sending letters from the Peterman ? This will explain why my letters have not been received. but I will write often, and perhaps one may "run the blockade" and get to you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot write any thing of the late battle, save a few incidents. Gen. Moore after Capt. Asper was wounded had command of the company and distinguished himself. I think he will be promoted. I think Capt. Asper will be, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I regretted that I could not accompany the boys on the pursuit but my arm was so that I could not. it is nearly well now. I forgot to say that we were at Strasburg. My portfolio with my papers got separated from me so I could not finish this before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must write to me very often and I will write very often too. Can you send me a copy of Laurie's poem "the Vision"? I learned of it from Charlie Brooks. He arrived here yesterday. I would very much like to see it and also your "Fifty years ahead." But if it will be any trouble you need not mind it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must close now as it is past tattoo. I may write more tomorrow so Good Night my own. Finis Charlie.</field>
