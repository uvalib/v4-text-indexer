      <field name="fulltext">The Elsmere 1408 H Street Washington D.C. University, May 3rd 1896 My dear, dear Rosalie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been wanting to write to you ever so long, but will not take up limited time and space with uninteresting excuses. I have simply overburdened myself, and have to cry "Mea Culpa!" in regard to many, many omissions of duty. I know you will be glad to hear that I got old Mr Cummings again at work upon our sections in the cemetery &amp; it looks so neat and clean, walks all around it, included, that I only wish you could see it before the summer drought spoils everything. Of course I had to resow grass seed, for it just seems as if grass will not retain its hold there, on account of too much shade and the inevitable summer droughts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As to the great matter and trouble to us all of Mr Thornton's resigning the chairmanship Mr Smith and I, as usual, were the last to hear of it. We were both so shocked, so appalled you may say, knowing how hard ly so large and expensive a family as yours would feel the deprivation of a whole quarter of one's salary to be. But then to persons of high and noble feelings like yourself yourselves, that was not the worst part but the consciousness of being misunder- stood by those who should know you better, is the bitter part, and worse yet slandered and falsely accused — But just let me tell you right here, I think you must be mistaken as to this being done to the extent you think or fear. For the Kents no more than ourselves, have heard one dis- respectful or complaining word of your dear husband all the session through. Do you know Mrs. Cochrane sitting by me at the Opera House April 27 was the first person outside the family to tell me of Mr Thornton's resigna- tion &amp; your letter to Rosalie came the same day confirming the news. The more I think of it, though, the more, I believe, it will be only a tem- porary cloud to pass away very quickly to make the sun shine all the brighter afterwards. Much will depend upon yourselves my dear Sister. It is a time calling for the exercise of the greatest wisdom and discretion — Mr Thornton is doing beautifully, looking bright and cheerful, manifesting the same interest as ever in University plans and prospects. Col. Randolph met Mr Smith accidentally &amp; told him of Mr Thornton's resignation &amp; Mr Smith told him up and down that the Board would repent of it, that his place could not be supplied. Above everything breathe not a word of ensuent poverty, your policy certainly is to let the world think the truth that Mr Thornton was very tired of an onerous, responsible post and was glad to devote himself to his more congenial studies. The min- ute you complain of small salary, people will say "We have to live on it." &amp; not a creature will be sorry. But if you bravely and unmurmuringly submit to the emergency as it stands— people with good heads will secretly sympa- thize &amp; my confident belief is, he will be enabled to resume his duties, if he wishes it, with greater éclat than ever before a year is out.— But who likes advice. In giving this, I follow that rule to "do as I would be done by" and now is the time to act the difficult role indicated above, but that is my view of the case. And if an older sister will not give what poor council she can, of what worth is she?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is a troublous world, but when all contrarieties are borne patiently in a spirit of submission to the Divine will they much redound to our best good. I dreamed that I saw you looking so well, coming in all unexpectedly and was overjoyed. Like Schiller's hero in the "Song of the Bell", after he has been burnt out of house &amp; home, he comforts himself, as you may do: He counts the heads of his children fair, And lo! Not a dear one is missing there. We shall all be so delighted to see you, the girls and dear little Edward, that we shall rise super- ior to secondary causes of annoyance. If we keep united as a family, we are a pretty strong band here. not made so by any of our contrivance either, and if we persistently pray for instead of hating our enemies, they cannot do us any real harm. Your lilacs bloomed beautifully I hear &amp; we shall have showers of roses in the least while. Willie thinks Mary's case has been neglected, but believes he can cure her. What a blessing! Dr. Harrison (J.C) continues to pay Rosalie devoted attention, and she seems to like him better than any one who has done the same before. This is before breakfast &amp; I am writing while the others sleep. With ever so much love from us all &amp; praying that God's blessing may transmute every ill to good.</field>
