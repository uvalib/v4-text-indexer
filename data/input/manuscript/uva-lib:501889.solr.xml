      <field name="fulltext">Jean's birth-day, July 26/86 Dear House —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have come up to the study to answer you. Mrs. C. &amp; I had just read your (no, Koto's) letter. As I left, I said "What shall I say for you?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"That I am on my knees."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It doesn't wholly express her shame &amp; sorrow &amp; humili- ation for forgetting to send those measurements, but it helps. Blamed if we don't forget every- thing , it seems to me. We live in shame; &amp; yet are not hardened. We feel as sharply &amp; blush as red as we used to do in our earlier days when we did remember something now &amp; then. Koto is a saint — but we knew that before; &amp; don't expect anything but saint- liness out of her; she is built that way, &amp; it probably comes in a manner easy to her: but how is it you don't fly out? Is the whole family laying for canonization?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Indeed it was a shame &amp; a pity; but Mrs. Clemens always has her hands so full that I always think her excusa- ble when she forgets a thing. She is the only one in the tribe who ever does remember.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are hoping the dress will get here in time, to-day .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I didn't forget to send that lingo-letter; I merely misunderstood Mrs. Clemens; I thought she had concluded to send it herself. I must explain that "Tom" is a girl — Daisy Warner — who plays "Tom Canty" when the children do the Prince-&amp;-Pauper private theatricals. Susy is rather gushy, but I suppose it's the natural thing for 14- year-olders. They seem to run a good deal to italics &amp; double adjectives; &amp; even then they appear to think they have but coldly expressed themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here is love to you both, from us all, &amp; thanking you for your fine leniency — SLC Mark</field>
