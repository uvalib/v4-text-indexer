      <field name="fulltext">38 th Regt Camped near Petersburg Virginia Oct the 4 th . 1863. My Dear Cousin Unity</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I seat my self , this beautiful sabath morning for purpose of responding to your kind favors of the 23 &amp; 28 of Sept. which I received several days ago, and would have answered them amidiately though I expected to have gon home soon, and thought that I would answer them in purson as I am such a sorry hand to write , Though it was my s mis fortune to be in formed that I could not go yet a while, I took it for my share and contented my self as usial, I think a soldier aught to be satisfied to do as well as I hav bin doing for the last few days. have a plenty of some thing good to eat and a good apitite to eat it. that is good enough for any body in war times. though you know it is not natrial for human being to be satisfied the better thay get. the better thay want. and the more thay get. the more thay want, And thare is non of them that knows how to appritiate a blesing until after thay are deprived of it, I know this by experience. for when I was permited to injoy the comforts of good home and kind frends on everry side of me. I was not satisfied. I wanted to change my base of operrations , thought that I could do better than what I was doing ther, O if I should ever be permited to injoy such comforts again. I would know how to appritiate them. (God grant that I may) Again I say it is not nartrial for us to be satisfied, though I injoy more comforts than I am worthey of, yet I am not satisfied. I thank God that I have bin spared and permited to injoy such great blesings while so meney far better than I am have bin cut down by both desease &amp; the enimy . I have bin permited to pass unhurt and injoy exerlant health, after all this I am not satisfied. I think that I would be rather better satisfied if the speculaters were all presed in to service so the poor women and children could get some thing to eat with out paying five times the worth of it, if thare is any thing to sell, a speculater is after it, faster than a hawk after a chicken, it would not do for me to have my way with them, thare is no news in this so I will hush it, unless I could say some thing better about them. I dont beleave thare is any news in camp of importance everry thing seems to be verry quiet a bout here Gen Corses [1] Brigade has came hae here. thay were sent to Tennessee when we first stoped here. thay say thay had a verry nice time while thay were gone they did not lo o se but verry few of thair men, our Chaplin has bin verry un well for several days though he is proveing now hope he will be well again in few days.

Cridlin [2] he is a verry nice young Baptist minister, I got a letter from sister Benson [3] this morning thay were all well, accept Jo he was at home complaining though I dont sepose that he was verry bad off. she said he was going to see his sweet heart . John is gone to the cook fire to make a slise potato pies. I wish you were here to take dinner with, I see a good meney Ladies pasing about camp, the married men are sending for thair wifes and boarding them with the citerzens around camp, I wrote to sister Mary the other day and for got to tel her that we did not nead any clothing. we drew a new suit the other day and dont nea want any clothing from home atal every thing you all sent in the box came safte I am under many obligations to you all for send ing us such a fine box it was a great treat to us, I will closes for the presant you must write me soon and gave me all the news</field>
