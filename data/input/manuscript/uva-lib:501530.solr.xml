      <field name="fulltext">Mecca March 23 1862 Charlie my darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do I not deserve - am I not worthy of a letter from my idol? This is not a tear.. I hope my tears are not quite so black as that ugly spot I can see no other reason why I do not recieve a letter. Dear one please tell me in what way I have offended you for I am sure that I have. or you would have written ere this. I have given my letters a review in my thoughts but do not know what I could have written to cause you to not write, unless it was the remark I made respecting your sending me Miss Holcombs letters. Dear Charlie I did not intend to write any thing in that, or any other letter to alienate your affections from me. Darling will you forgive me if I have done wrong? Oh, I can not believe. dearest. that such is the case. Charlie. would that you knew Addies heart you would know that she could not willingly wound your feelings. Two long weeks have fled since I recieved your last. I more like two months. I heard that the "3rd Brigade" had moved but did not learn where it had gone. nevertheless I shall continue directing to the "Valley of Virginia" until recieving instructions to direct in some other direction. I am at home now. I came home friday last. "our folks" were quite anxious for me to come. and I came. Do not wonder, my darling, that I did not feel very desirous about coming. for how could I. but hush! do not allow me to write to you in a discontented tone.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you not think. dearest that the future contains for us? Ah! I know it does. "God in Heaven help" me to become worthy of such a noble heart as my Charlie possesses. and I must become worthy. I am not now. but the future will show what. a determined will can do. Do you not think it will?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved a letter friday from the "Learge sisters." Mollie wanted me to rem - ember her to that correspondent of mine that bothered her so much when she was at Auntie's. My dear good auntie! How much happiness I have enjoyed this winter. One could not keep from tender chords of Love from vibrating sweetly when with her in her pleasant home. I trust you will know her some future day..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your health. loved one. how is that Good I hope. Mine is good with the exception of a severe cold. I do not think it is as bad as when I wrote you last. I was with Dora then.. I came home the next day. I felt so bad that I was fearful of a protracted illness. and thought I had better come home. Charlie. have you read Carl Schurp's speech upon "Restoring the Union by extinguishing Slavery"? It is a magnificent address.. In it he says - but stop I will send you the paper that contains it and you can read it for yourself.. But it is getting too dark to write more. May Guardian Angels watch over thee. my darling is the prayer of your own Addie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good night dearest. my precious one. my hearst idol. my all.</field>
