      <field name="fulltext">near Fairfax Court House Tuesday Sept. 18 th , 1861 Dear Ma,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will perceive by the heading of this, that we have changed our camp a few miles. Though you need fear no hostile demonstrations on the account as we are yet ten or twelve miles from the outposts. We were only moved about five miles—only one mile below us in Fairfax Court House [1] , a very pretty village in time of peace, but now every where you see signs of the presence of soldiers; a general air of neglect and confusion, fences torn down, tents of regiments and brigades seem in every direction as far as can be seen through the openings of trees. The country here is very pretty; it is hilly, though not such high hills as we are accustomed to in the valley, but a succession of low parallel l ridges running nearly north and south, which render the appearance a great deal more beautiful than the low flat country around the Junction. It is very densely wooded—mostly pine and the whole filled up with thick under growth , forming the very best protection to the pickets and scouting parties, and also a shelter for those terrible engines of destruction (to the Yankees)-"masked batteries." [2]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Troops are still concentrating between this place and our picket lines—the main body of the army is here—what it all means no one of course can tell, though you may rest assured there will be no more falling back on the Junction, unless we are com pletely beaten, of which however I have little fear. I do not believe the Yankees are ready to fight us yet—their loss was too great on the 21 st July for them to have recovered from it so soon. [3] All military operations are exceedingly dull and sluggish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are both very well and right pleasantly situated, if indeed a camp life can be, at all pleasant. The camp is a right good one, the water not quite so good as that we left.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">William Wilson [4] reached camp this morning, from Fairfax Station where he left the boxes, and for which we will send tomorrow. He gave us all the news, both from home and Rockbridge . The Cars now run regularly to Fairfax Station , about 3 miles from the Court House. You will hereafter direct your letters to Fairfax Station Company I 4 th Regiment Va. Volunteers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I suppose Charles told you that Capt. White's resignation has been accepted and that Mr. Morrison has been elected Captain. He will make an excellent captain. I like him very much. He is one of the most industrious and intelligent men I ever saw. [5]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Father wished to know that amount coming to William from the Confederacy. [6] Capt. White is not here and Capt. Morrison knows nothing about it, he can only make the calculations at $11 per month which results as follows: $31.63 up to the first of July and then 16 days in that month $5.50 making $37.13. The pay master made a note on the pay rolls, that William had died and the day of his death (16th of July) but the amount could be drawn at anytime without difficulty. Any statement from the Capt could in no way, be of any service, I think. He can find out better in Staunton than any one here can tell him. I am going to Fairfax Station today for the boxes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much love to everybody. As ever your son. Andrew Brooks Eston is very well, the most con tented man in camp. John D. [7] is pretty well. Lieutenant Wilson has been right sick but is now nearly well.</field>
