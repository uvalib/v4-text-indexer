      <field name="fulltext">Fort Moultrie, Charleston H r December 1 st 1828 Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The letter of Lieut J. Howard left by M r John O. Lay for your perusal will explain the cause of my writing from Fort Moultrie .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your note addressed to M r Lay , &amp; inclosed by him to Lieut: Howard was handed over by the latter to my- -self . In that note what chiefly gave me concern was hearing of your indisposition — I can readily see &amp; forgive the suggestion which prompted you to write "he had better remain as he is until the termination of his enlistment." 1 It was perhaps under the impression that a military life was one after my own heart, and that it might be possible (although contrary to the Re- -gulations of our Army) to obtain a commission for one who had not received his education at West Point , &amp; who, from his age, was excluded that Academy; but I could not help thinking that you believed me degraded &amp; disgraced and that anything were preferable to my returning home &amp; entailing on yourself a portion of my infamy: But, at no period of my life, have I regarded myself with a deeper satisfaction, or did my heart swell with more honourable pride — The time may come (if at all it will come speedily) when much that appears of a doubtful nature will be explained away, and I shall have no hesitation in appearing among my former connections — at the present I have no such intention, and nothing, short of your absolute command, should deter me from my purpose.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been in the American army as long as suits my ends or my inclination, and it is now time that I should leave it — To this effect I made known my circumstances to Lieut Howard who promised me my discharge solely upon a re-conciliation with yourself — In vain I told him that your wishes for me (as your letter assured me) were, and had always been those of a father &amp; and that you were ready to forgive even the worst offenses — He insisted upon my writing you &amp; and that if a re-concilation could be effected he would grant me my wish. This was advised in the goodness of his heart &amp; with a view of serving me in a double sense — He has always been kind to me, and, in many respects, reminds me forcibly of yourself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The period of an Enlistment is five years — the prime of my life would be wasted — I shall be driven to more decided measures if you refuse to assist me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You need not fear for my future prosperity — I am altered from what you knew me, &amp; am no longer a boy tossing about in the world without aim or consistency. I feel that within me which will make me fulfil your highest wishes &amp; only beg you to suspend your judgement until you hear of me again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will perceive that I speak confidently — but when did ever Ambition exist or Talent prosper without prior conviction of success? I have thrown myself on the world, like the Norman conqueror on the shores of Britain &amp;, by my avowed assurance of victory, have destroyed the fleet which could alone cover my retreat. I must either conquer or die — succeed or be disgraced.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A letter addressed to Lieut: J. Howard assuring him of your re-conciliation with myself (which you have never yet refused) &amp; desiring my discharge would be all that is necessary — He is already acquainted with you from report &amp; the high character given of you by M r Lay .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write me once more if you do really forgive me me let me know how my Ma preserves her health, and the concerns of the family since my departure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pecuniary assistance I do not desire — unless of your own free &amp; unbiassed choice — I can struggle with any difficulty. My dearest love to Ma — it is only when absent that we can tell the value of such a friend — I hope she will not let my wayward disposition wear away the love she used to have for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours respectfully &amp; affectionately, Edgar A. Poe P.S. We are now under order to sail for Old Point Comfort , and will arrive there before your answer can be received — Your address then will be to Lieut: J. Howard, Fortress Monroe . the same for myself.</field>
