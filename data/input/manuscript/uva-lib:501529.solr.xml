      <field name="fulltext">Maple Grove March 14 th '62 My Darling Charlie..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What can be more lovely than this day. warm as the summer days generally are and the more beautiful because it is March.. Can you see me. Charlie sitting here on the root of a maple tree about two feet above the little brook that is south of Auntie's house? Here I have been sitting dreaming and listening to the babbling of the little stream till it sounded like sweet music. and then commenced talking to me of absent loved ones. occasionally looking at the sun that is peeping through the soft haze which envelopes it. until--well something struck me. the thought that I would go to the house and get my writing desk. When I started back.. I caught up Titcombs "Lessons in Life," and here it lies on the mossy bank by my side. Oh! who is not a lover of Nature.. the true mother of all beauty.. Here I can sit and dream for hours. with no companion but the little birds that are even now singing among the not leafy but leafless boughs above my head. And of what am I dreaming. do you ask? Of what could I be dreaming save my Charlie.. It does seem like "fairy land" wonder if I could not see their footprints up on the hill. How I wish I was an artist would not I draw some grand sketches.. Or if you were. but here. I presume I would have you installed immediately.. Oh. Charlie. what is there now to hinder you from coming home. Manassas. Winchester. and all of the prominent places that are in the possession of our troops. I can see no objections why you can not come I do wish to see this must be to those whose friends have gone. What can ever give them strength to bear the great grief but the hope of meeting them in death..</field>

      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, March 16, 1862</field>
      <field name="fulltext">March 16 th Dear Charlie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I commenced this I intended to send it by the evening mail.. but we had company in the afternoon.. and I found no time.. I attended a party that evening in Bristol. I did not enjoy myself very well. I know not why.. but I felt lonesome. Amid all the laughter music and dancing. feelings of love _______ would steal over me. Charlie I am not enjoy ing my self. at parties as I used to. every peal of laughter that escapes from me seems more like a death knell. while our country is in such peril.. and hundreds of its protectors are bleeding and dying, how can I enjoy such frivolities.. I cannot enter them with any heart and where I have no heart for any thing I can not enjoy it. I had the pleasure of seeing Charlie Brooks while there. He returns to the army one week from to morrow, so he said. He seemed quite anxious to go. I can not blame him either.</field>
