      <field name="fulltext">Provost Marshals Office Harper's Ferry Nov. 7th , 1862 My darling Addie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Quite a long time has elapsed since I last wrote you, and I fear you will think I am trespassing too far on your goodness and forbearance. But when I explain this unwanted silence, I think you will forgive me — at least in part. Two precious letters have been recieved from you, each of which deserves an "answer" complete in itself, b y ut at this time it is im- possible for one to write a very long or interesting letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You percieve by the "heading" that I am in the Provost Marshal's office at this place, where I have been since Sunday, — in the pleasant situation of Pro. Mar. Clerk.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Regt — in fact the Brigade was aroused from our pleasant camp in Loudon Valley on Thursday morning to "move with Camp and Garrison equipage, at 6 A.M." and at that time we were in line and even marching toward Harper's Ferry , through which we passed to Bolivar Heights , where we halted for further orders.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The result was — we had to go out on Picket duty leaving a few men to pitch our camp at Bolivar Heights . We were not relived until late Friday night and then was obliged to walk 4½ miles to attain a point only ¾ mile away. This was to gratify a "stylish Colonel." Saturday and Sunday I was quite unwell, but Sunday P.M. I was detailed for this duty, and in view of the coming cold weather and cheerless camps, I thought I would come. The work — though steady — is not very heavy and with our present Provost Marshal — Capt. Church Howe , of Gen Sedgwick 's Staff — I could wish for nothing save a good long Leave of Absence to visit my own — my darling Addie .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it is useless for one to wish for that even, for "Furloughs" are a fruit not growing very plentifully in these parts, and most difficult to obtain, still, if the thing is possible , I shall come home this Winter. By the way, old Boreas has made his appearance with us, and left — no, not left, for he hasn't gone — but is making his footsteps plainly visible. It has snowed continually all day, and the surrounding hills are quite enshrouded in a snowy mantle — (There — think of being enshrouded in a mantle ; ain't I poetic?)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Of course, you have heard of the "Advance", and of course are anxious to learn if the Seventh is "with the army". For a wonder, we — our entire Corps — are in the rear, actually remaining to garrison this famous "City of Burnt Shops", and the surrounding Heights!!!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">From all I can learn, we will doubtlessly remain here this coming Winter, and nothing could be more acceptable to us as a regiment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Now I will briefly reply to a portion of your letters — but do not think, my darling Addie that I wish to neglect them, nothing is farther from my thoughts — I will write a good long letter soon, and devote "lots" of time and care to it The office is crowded now, and it is quite late in the evening.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your letter of the 24th Oct , surprised me not a little. It was in relation to Laura and her late painful and unfortunate affair with Hi. Grant . I had known Grant previously to my enlistment, while in Mecca and had never dreamed that he could be guilty of such deep=dyed villainy as striving to win the affection of a pure, noble= minded lady, while engaged to another. He is not worth the name of " Man " — does not deserve the friendship even of a dog . It is difficult to imagine a person so low, so vile, as to trifle with the holiest thoughts and passions, and so heartlessly destroy the highborn impulses of the soul — aye break the heart itself. God will mete out justice to such men, — He has written " vengeance is mine I will repay ." To Laurie in her new estate — as Mrs. Thompson — I wish pure and unbroken happiness — a future un= dimmed by clouds of adversity, and a long and happy life</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Could I wish more? May the good giver of all good pre- serve her and thee — my own loved Adelaide .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am almost sorry that Hal did not succeed in filling up the 84th to the required standard, but perhaps it is all for the best — I know you will say so, as it precludes his return to the field. Had he been successful, I should have endeavered to be transferred into his Regt, as it is, I will, quietly of course, remain in the "Bloody Seventh."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close this very uninteresting letter, as Lieut Howe has come in, and I must report the "prisoners" Remember me to all — particularly to Papa. Hallie and Laurie but most particularly remember me to your own darling self and write as soon as convenient. From Your own devoted and true Charley Tenney. Address— Chas. N. Tenney Care of Capt Howe — Prov. Marshal Harper's Ferry Va. Omit the Co. &amp; Regt.</field>
