      <field name="fulltext">After so long an absence I again seat myself for the purpose of droping you a fiew lines My health is very good and I hope this may find you enjoying the same Thare is no news of importance transpiering at presant along the lines I hope our fall campaign is over &amp; that we may soon go in to winter quarters We have had a rite severe campaign for the last two weeks I think we will moove to some camp today we had orders last night to moove this morning at nine oclock you must parden me for not writing soon while on the march thare was little or no chance to send letters back and I was always so tired after the days march that I felt more like lying down than writing I recieved yours of the 6 on the 8th was truly glad to hear from you oh how I wished that I could come home for a fiew days to see your Cousin and my friend united in holy wedlock but alas I had to serve my country first; then wait on my friends; since writing the above we have mooved our camp near five miles. The boys are generally busy now policing &amp; putting up bunks we are campt two miles south of Brandy Station I think we will stay hear for some time we have a very nice camp; but the water is not very good. You asked me questions in you first letter I neglected answering, hope it is not to late now. I mess with my old messmates Trotter, Abny, Grever, Hatten Britton &amp; two Ruebushes, they all say it will not do to brake up our mess while the war lasts hope that may not be long. Tom is well he was unwell for a week or two. This march has improved is health greatly John has been unwell for a day or two but is getting something better Hunter is very unwell I think he is theatend with the fever. Capt is right unwell I think he was sent to some private house today Jake is getting quite well again he got along better through the campaign better than I expected he would The boys will all recruit up now I hope. I suppose your cous Kate is married before this Oh how much I would like to have been thare I know I could have had my own fun I wish them much hapiness through this changing wourld of ours. I recieved a letter from John B dated the 8th he did not now what day it would come off I hurd that John was to be a waiter. I was surprised to hear of your cous Fannie getting married. Mr Baker is from Winchester is he not; I had thought that Capt Burke was waiting on her if so I suppose she gave him the slide. I will not have room or time to give you any of the perticulars of the campaign as I have to do my part in policing our quarters; oh I wish I could be with you for a while to tell you of the many pleasant dreams I have had about you last nights in perticular Oh I hope the time may soon come when I may have the pleasure of steeling a sweet kiss from your pure lips oh dear Kate I can never forget you &amp; would wish to never be forgotten by the ones that I think as much of as my life I received your note enclosed in Jakes letter was truly glad to hear from you. if I have omited any thing in this please forgive write soon. I will write again as soon as we get fixed up in our new camp</field>
