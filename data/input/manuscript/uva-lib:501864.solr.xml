      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Edgar Allan Poe, Baltimore, to John Allan, 1829 July 26 Manuscript, Valentine Museum, Richmond, Virginia</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore July 26 1829 Dear Pa,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received yours of the 19 th on the 22 d ult o &amp; am truly thankful for the money which you sent me, notwithstanding the taunt with which it was given "that men of genius ought not to apply to your aid"—It is too often their necessity to want that little timely assistance which would prevent such applications—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I did not answer your letter by return of mail on account of my departure for Washington the next morning—but before I proceed to tell the event of my application I think it my duty to say something concerning the accusations &amp; suspicions which are contained in your letter—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As regards the substitute, the reason why I did not tell you that it would cost $75— was that I could not possibly foresee so improbable an event—The bounty is $12—&amp; unless but for the absence of Col. House &amp; L t Howard at the time of my discharge it would have been all that I should have had to pay. The officer commanding a company can (if he pleases) enlist the first recruit who offers &amp; muster him as a substitute for another, of course paying only the bounty of 12$ but as L t Howard &amp; Col House were both absent, this arrangement could not be effected. As I had told you it would only cost me $12 I did nt wish to make you think me imposing upon you—so upon a substitute offering for $75—I gave him $25 &amp; gave him my note of hand for the balance—when you remitted me $100— thinking I had more than I should want I thought it my best opportunity of taking up my note—which I did.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you will take into consideration the length of time I have been from home, which was occasioned by my not hearing from you (&amp; I was unwilling to leave the city without your answer, expecting it every day) &amp; other expenses, you will find that it has been impossible for me to enter into any extravagances or improper expense—even sup -posing I had not lost the $46—the time which intervened between my letter &amp; your answer in the first instance was 22 days— in the latter one month &amp; 4 days—as I had no reason to suppose you would not reply to my letter as I was unconscious of having offended it would have been imprudent to leave without your answer—this expense was unavoidable. As regards the money which was stolen I have sent you the only proof in my possession a letter from Mosher in which there is an acknowledgement of the theft—I have no other. On receiving your last letter, I went immediately to Washington , on foot, &amp; have returned the same way, having paid away $40 for my bill &amp; being unwilling to spend the balance. when I might avoid it, until I could see what pros -pects were in view. I saw M r Eaton , he addressed me by name, &amp; in reply to my questions told me—"that of the 47 surplus, on the roll, which I mentioned in my former letters, 19 were rejected 9 dismissed &amp; 8 resigned—consequently there was yet a surplus of 10 before me on the roll On asking for my papers of recommendation, which might be of service elsewhere— he told me that in that case my application would be considered as withdrawn, which he strongly advised me not to do—saying that there were still hopes of my obtaining the appointment in Sep r . as during the enca m pment every year there were numerous resignations— if the number exceeded 10 I should be sure of the app t without further application in Sep r . if not I would at last be among the first on the next roll for the ensuing year— when of course my appointment was certain—when I mentioned that I feared my age would interfere he replied that 21 was the limit—that many entered at that time—&amp; that I might call myself 21 until I was 22—On leaving the office he called me back to endorse on my papers the name of my P. Office—I wrote Richmond . He said that I should certainly hear from him &amp; that he regretted my useless trip to Washington — These are his precise words—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Having now explained every circumstance that seemed to require an explanation &amp; shown that I have spared no exertions in the pursuit of my object. I write to you for information as to what course I must pursue—I would have re- -turned home immediately but for the words in your letter "I am not particularly anxious to see you" I know not how to interpret them</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I could not help thinking that they amouted to a prohibition to return—if I had any means of support until I could obtain the appointment, I would not trouble you again—I am conscious of having offended you formerly—greatly—but I thought that had been forgiven . at least you told me so— I know that I have done nothing since to deserve your displeasure—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As regards the poem, I have offended only in asking your approbation—I can publish it upon the terms you mentioned—but will have no more to do with it without your entire approbation— I will wait with great anxiety for your answer you must be aware how important it is that I should hear from you soon—as I do not know how to act</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am yours affectionately Edgar A. Poe</field>
