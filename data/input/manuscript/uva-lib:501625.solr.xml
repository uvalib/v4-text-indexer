      <field name="fulltext">Raleigh C.H. June 3rd 1862 Dear Friend—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your note (for it is too short to be called a letter) of the 18th came duly to hand, being forwarded from Winfield .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We left that place on the 9th of May. We remained a week at Gauley Bridge , when we proceeded to this place. We expected an at= tack when we first arrived from Humphrey Marshall who was reported coming on the Loagan Road with a considerable force.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We immediately commenced forti= fying but up to this time all is quiet. The only force here at present is our regiment and about 100 Cavalry. The balance of our Brigade is at Lewisburg . Gen. Cox's forces are at Flat Top Moun= tain, 19 miles from here. Our Bri= gade consists of the 11th, 36th, 44th and 47th Ohio Regiments and Simmons' Battery and under the command of Col. Crook (acting Brig. Gen. )</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not know how long we shall remain here. We are to be mustered and paid this week, and I suppose we shall sooner after move somewhere. I am begin= ning to be habituated to a soldier's life, but the thought often comes across my mind that I am not learning anything useful and for= getting what little I do know.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I hope the war will close in time for me to come go to Pennsyl= vania to help you cut some of / that fruit you are bragging of. Tell the Governor to put up plenty of ci= der as I shall be a frequent visit= or this summer next winter. It is singular you have noth= ing to write. Of course I do not expect to hear important war news, but there is certainly some= thing to write. How is your duck? How is my duck? How are the ducks generally? How are the male sex? Is anyone commit ting matrimony? &amp;c. &amp;c. etc. etc. Dou have any fun? Are any of our old friends in the army? Good Lord! if I were in there writing a letter to myself I could fill six sheets of foolscap.—</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My case is different. I am the only person in the regiment &amp; of course you are not particular about thare welfare. The war news you can learn much better from the papers than I can communi= cate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I have met with no im= portant personal adventures late= ly, — I must now close for want of matter to write.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my respects to your family and friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hoping soon to hear from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain Respectfully yours D.R.P. Shoemaker P.S. Your offer to pay the postage on this letter comes in quite con= venient, just now. I always manage to have a little loose change in my pocket, but just at this time there are no postage stamps in the place. And the Quarter Master is not authorised to take money, so I had to let him frank it. Direct your letter thus D.R.P. Shoemaker Co. E. 11th Regiment 3rd Brigade O.V.I. Raleigh C.H. , Virginia</field>
