      <field name="heading_text">Miss Amanda C. Armentrout, Greenville, Augusta Co V a</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jan. 13 th 1859 Fancy Hill Dear Friend;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I suppose you think I have forgotten you but far from it. I received your kind &amp; affectionate letter, and was truely glad to hear from you &amp; my old school-mates on the Creek. I am not very well at present, as I have a very bad cold, which is quite common in this vicinity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, news is so very scarce I hardly no where to get intelligence to write to you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was in company with some ladies last night, and my ideas are a little tangled, and it requires some exertion to extricate them. But I managed to keep my heart, and am no suscipient (as you already know) of other people's hearts. I hope you had a joyous time, during your meeting at Calvary, &amp; also hope you had a revival of religion in your midst. You said that there was need of one in your neighborhood; you need not limit it to your own neighborhood for all neighborhoods need it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You made mention of some in Greenville, who had made a profession, I was glad to hear of it, and hope they will remain "steadfast in faith."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You hoped, (you said) that I might succeed in getting one of Mrs. P. daughters, I have not courted them yet &amp; have not gotton sense enough to do that; I think I will have to take a few lessons under you, for fear I begin wrong and fail in my attempt. You said that you would like for me to send you my likeness, I'm afraid I would break all the glass that can be started. I am very thankful that I am going to school where I am; I know Midway of old, and the "Burg" is not far behind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Well, I want to go to prayer meeting to night, so I must conclude. Give my love to all inquiring friends &amp; accept a portion for yourself. Write soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours, affectionately from your friend John P. Lightner P.S. I wanted to come down Christmas but circumstances did not permit. I hope to see you some of these days on earth if not in heaven. Be zealous in the work before. Tell Jacob to be patient.</field>
