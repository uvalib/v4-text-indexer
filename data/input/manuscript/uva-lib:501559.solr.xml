      <field name="fulltext">Farmington. Nov.. 23 rd 1862 My own loved Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How very much I thank you for your darling letter that arrived last evening. You know not dearest how long and anxuously I had looked for a letter since you wrote of your recent indisposition..-- how I had prayed God to watch over thee in sickness and in health,-- how I had mour[n]ed over the fate that has kept such a barrier of miles twixt thee and me. best beloved-- until I was nearly ill.. If you would spare me pain my love write often True your excuses were sufficient. and I forgive you Indeed the joy of once again hearing from you--of once again reading your own dear loving thoughts addressed to me darling more than cancled all the pain I had suffered And art thou now well now darling? Art thou suffering far away from me-- with no kind hand to alleviate the pain Look to God dearest. He can relieve and be with you. for much as I regret it I can not be with you only in spirit and that-- always . How very thankful I am darling that you are in the position you now occupy instead of performing the arduous duties of camp life and marching As Carrie said-- our Carrie Kibbee)-- when I told her where you were. "Oh! Addie, are'nt you so glad". and in the. dear girls joy . she actually--kissed me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh. darling how I wish you to come home, Were you here I do believe you would regain health and strength much faster than you now do. I would devote myself so much to your happiness that you could not help but get well, Do you not thing so dear?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you intend darling to bid me hope when you said if the thing were possible you would come home this winter; If so. that you a thousand times, How much I wish you to return. why you can not know.. But you will wish to know about my self will you not dear? I am well. much better than I was before I recieved you precious letter. and am enjoying myself as well as I can-- from thee , I like Farmington very much indeed, also the school. Although I have not as yet become acquainted with many of the students yet time passes swiftly and pleasantly. Indeed I see no reason why it should not. Altho. Hallie and papa would not premit me to take as many studies as I wished to do. yet with the splendid company of M r Kibbee's family with whom I am boarding time does not lag I can assure you. How much I desire you to become acquainted with Carrie and Emma, they are such splendid girls Would you like to know the subjects of my studies? They are Algebra. Latin and Music. I wished very much to take another study, but Hal. would not listen to it. It affords me an opportunity of reading more than I could otherwise do, We spend very pleasant evenings in reading useful and appropriate books, Would you not like to join our circle some evening? I should dearly love to have you do so, But darling, it is getting late besides here are Mr, and Mrs. Kibbee. Carrie and Emma, Miss Michalson. (an assistant teacher in the seminary) and Mr Wolcott, son-in-law of Mr. Kibbee's, all discussing the one common theme--War Quite an interesting discussion, You will excuse this short letter darling? I would write more in the morning but the mail goes out quite early and I will not have time. Be very careful of your health dearest, and write very soon too</field>
