      <field name="fulltext">Monday Morning 17 th ,61</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Last evening, about eight oclock we were called out to battle The cause was this. Two Reg'ts I have not learned which ones, from the effects of whisky, raised an insurrection. An order came from head quarters to the Seventh to form in line of battle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Somewhat surprised, Lieut Case gave the order to the Company "Every man into line with bayonets fixed" We were ignorant of the cause but were out to a man. I was standing by the officer's tent when the order was given to I ran to the quarters, seized my musket, fixed my bayonet, and was in line the second man I boast now, Am I not an egotist Well Addie, not a man was lost After marching about half a mile word came to us that the victory was won. Until then we knew nothing of our duty save to obey orders. even if it was to "charge bayonets"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On our return, Col. Tyler made the following remarks.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Soldiers of the Seventh Reg't. You were called out for the purpose of quelling a rebellion, but this has been accomplished without our assistance. I cannot refrain from expressing my gratitude for your promptness in obeying my orders. I am proud of my regiment. Not a regiment as far as we went was out, notwithstanding the order was given. There has been an insurrection in our midst Two regiments have openly rebelled in camp. Whisky was at the bottom of it, I am glad to find the seventh regiment so willing to do their duty, even to put down insuborni na tion I trust the Seventh Regiment will never so far forget duty and as to be carried away by whisky (Cheers, and cries of no!no) Let every man conduct himself in such a manner, that he will be proud of belonging to the noble seventh. I can only give you my thanks for your prompt response to the call of duty." [space in text]We gave three times three hearty cheers for Col. Tyler &amp; returned to our quarters</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the riot were thirteen badly wounded &amp; several more bruised &amp; badly frightned. I just learned that it was the Tenth and Thirteenth Regiments . . If we had arrived in time we would have had a fight Among all the excitement Lieut Case was cool and collected, as was Lieut Wood . Every order was distinctly and deliberately given, and was well executed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Lieut. H . B. is more a favorite now than ever in the company and last night won the admiration of all who saw &amp; heard him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would like to see you very much indeed: come if you possibly can. I have just heard a report that we are to march Saturday next. but I do not believe it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please excuse this writing for there is about a dozen moving about jarring the table. &amp; I have just come in from drill &amp; write in a hurry.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write immediately--if you please &amp; can to Yours Charley.</field>
