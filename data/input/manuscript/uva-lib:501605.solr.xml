      <field name="fulltext">Harper's Ferry, Va. Oct. 21 st , 1862 . My dearest Addie ,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have had that most horrible of all diseases “Hypochondria,” and still feel a little “blue”,-- but I have no business to either. Why? Because I have just recieved your darling letter of the 12 th . Now I am going by force of will, and an hours conversation with my treasure, to dispel all traces of this horrible feeling. I can do it, andIwill .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First, let me place your portrait--that radiant lovely countenance, before me, and allow me to gaze for a moment into those loving eyes. There it is--lying upon my Bible, which which is yet open at the 42 nd &amp; 3 d Psalms, (I have been reading.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Are you well, my love? No answer,--yet that same quiet smiles bids me good cheer. "Why art thou cast down O my soul? Why art thou disquieted within me?" " Hope thou in God ." Yes, I will hope in God, and He shall preserve thee and me. Pardon me, Addie mine, I have been thinking of that home, which is no_home to me, and like a child, have allowed myself to indulge in memories of younger days when I would look forward into that misty Future and picture to myself happiness--myself beloved by brothers, sisters, Father and Mother , then I passed to the day when I should have had, at least the sympathies of a Father when I sprang in my love of justice and liberty, to the defence of my -- our flag, but no wishes for my success--no hopes for my return, but a cold shoulder, a cool “no difference.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children." But I am more calm now. I am loved, Thou art my betrothed-- Laurie is my sister-- Hallie is my brother-- and I am happy. Yes, indeed am I, my heart is lighter by far. But I fear I have written much that is uninteresting, if not painful to you: if so, forgive me, for my heart was full. Now that baleful “Hypo” is gone, I can write with greater ease. How I should love to see you and chat with you and--yes, fold your precious self to my heart, but mine is the fortune of a soldier, and I will be a soldier, a stern unflinching one too, save to my dear friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will tell you how I came to wander back in my reverie. The camp is almost deserted today. Last evening, or night rather, for it was midnight, the Adjutant came around, and gave the order to get ready to march with two days rations . Well, I did not go, for I have been ailing for the past 3 or 4 days and the Surgeon ordered me to keep quiet. The regiment started about 12.30 crossed the Blue Ridge and proceeded toward Hillsborough , where they now are. The object probably is to prevent the enemy from leaving the Valley . I judge from the activity prevailing in camp that our “ Little Mac ” intends to make a forward move soon, but new orders must be issued or we shall remain at Harper's Ferry . for a general order was issued to the effect that the 2 d and 12 th Army corps are to remain at this place as a Winter garrison. Ours, you know, is the 12 th , and of course the order relates to us. Still, I do not place too much confidence in it, for it is not the good luck of the Seventh . But it is growing dark and I will wait until the candle is lighted when I will converse again with you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good evening, Addie mine. Will you sit upon my lowly couch while we have a little chat? No, well sit where you like, your spirit must be with me this, the evening of the 21 st of October. Byron --you love Byron ? So do I. Well do I remember how I used to love "the Corsair." But about as touching as any lines he wrote, at least to me, are those commencing “Maid of Athens, ere we part, Give, O give me back my heart . But I am not in a poetical mood this evening, so pardon me if I introduce politics. The election is over and thank Heaven Vallandigheim is defeated. Will the dog dare again to appear before honest loyal men? If he were to enter our camp, I greatly fear he would not leave it alive, so intense is the hatred existing toward him here. I trust now that the “2 d Tuesday in Oct. ” is past, that the subject of “political generals” will be consigned to oblivion. I am assured in my mind that this miserable bickering about politics, mixing poison with the questions of the greatest importance, has delayed the war eight months. Political influence at the War department prevented M c Clellan from having the cooperation of M c Dowell's corps, after the Battle of and advance from Williams burg . It prevented him from receiving reinforcements (to any great extent) until after the six days battles . It deposed Gen's. Fremont and Hunter . It has kept Gen. Banks from a fit position, and in command of one of the smallest corps in the army. It whipped us at Bull Run , for by political influence the traitor M c Dowell was kept in command. Heaven pardon me if I am wrong, but I am tired of politics and policitical influences. It has almost ruined our noble Republic! Away with it, for tonight at least.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Shall we visit the Hospital? Here we are, in the village of Harper's Ferry , and in the Hospital . That laughing chink of a boy is Billy Bennett of our Mess. (No. 3.) he is caring for Ambrose Trimmer . he has the fever. Fred. Roberts is here too, not very sick, but not doing duty . Let us go to St. Pauls Church Hosp. Alexandria . Ah! Bob. Murray is hopping around on crutches, but will never be fit for duty again. Geo. Moore is here, not very well. He cant keep quiet long enough to get well. He sends love--brotherly love he says, for he is my brother. You do not know the rest, so we will just see that they are doing well, and will walk home. Here we are just at the door, now a parting loving kiss, and “farewell for the present”. Give my love to all, and dream of me tonight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write often I am ever thine own , now cheerful. Charley.</field>
