      <field name="fulltext">Maple Grove. April 20. 1862 My "precious" Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not think dear one that I address you thus merely as a salutation for I feel that you are precious to me. The reason that I write the word "precious" as I do,, your apologies for addressing me by endearing names shall I say troubled me [;] I was surprised darling. almost pained when I read your letter I had not thought of confining myself to the rules of etiquette when writing to you. nor do I think I ought: I always speak as I feel and generally obey the dictations of my heart; Have I not done right? those that I loved I always have my own form of addressing them by irrespective of etiquette. I love to be called by pet names,, shall I tell you what Hal and papa used to call me: Hal's pet name for me was "Birdie" and father's (dont laugh now) was "Whip-stalk,," When a child I was very slender and quite tall, hence papa called me by that "tender" expression. I just asked father (he is here at aunties) if he remembers what he used to call me. He replied that he did,, but does not think I am much of a whip stalk now. that I am now more of a chub. Ha ha you say that not more than a week passes without writing to me. How strange! Last week I received two letters from you the first time I have received one from you oftener than in ten days and sometimes much longer for two months I guess. Charlie dear, would you have thought me doing right if I had engaged a school and gone on - commenced teaching &amp;c, without speaking to you in regard to any future occupations? Truly you would not have wished me to. You say "you found the bitter with the sweet" while teaching. I have considered all this but is it not always so in life; and should I not teach because I will find perhaps a few unpleasant days? I think I shall love teaching.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Monday morning.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Going to church prevented me from finishing this last evening. therefore "monday morning" has to "suffer" Not a very lovely morning either. for "heaven is weeping" and I tend to think quite sad. Great drops trickled down on the window panes, and this "romantic little stream" is rising swelling as if anxious to escape from the bed which was made for it. The thought "I pity the brave soldiers to day" was the first that entered my mind after awakening from a sweet and gentle sleep this morning. Bless God for sleep. Last night I was very tired and felt more than "half sick" but I feel as well as ever this morning. I scarcely know which had the greatest effect in restoring me my sleep or my dreams . Both took an active part "I reckon" Oh how sweet are dreams, but at times they are horrific, not often though Dearest. I am again called to thank you for your splendid gift the Cross Lanes battle. 1 How beaut - iful! and how kind [in] you to send it. Thanks seem almost as insults now. you have presented me with so many gifts but may God spare you my own and I will strive to reward you. I love gifts! Now do not think dearest that I love you for your gifts far from it dear. I love you for yourself alone. for your true and noble heart. Oh Charlie when I listen to Hallie's remarks of you and hear him mention some of your noble acts how my heart warms with love and - may Heaven forgive me - pride. It is then I feel how unworthy I am of you and then I wonder if it is right for me to love you as I do love. Darling strange thoughts enter my mind at times. Emblematic of the "strange girl" of whom I have heretofore written. Do you not think so. But I will tire you if I write thus. Laura is here in front of me and on the floor with her back supported by the wall. Sober little Deacon! Charlie I wish you were here to "shore her up" My fear is getting to rundown to affect her and I do not like to see her so sad. When I go to Claridon you must write her great long letters and cheerful ones too. She loves your letters very much. Who would not. Auntie wishes me to ask you if have had your revenge for the Cross Lanes defeat. John Chafee 2 wrote home that he had. But time forbids that I should write longer. Regards to the boys, &amp;c Write real often. I think I told you to write to East Claridon did I not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Heaven guard and bless thee dearest. Yours: &amp;c Addie</field>
