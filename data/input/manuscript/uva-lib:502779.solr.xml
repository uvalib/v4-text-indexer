      <field name="fulltext">Tis said that absence conquers love But oh believe it not. I've tried alas its powers to prove, But thou art not forgot. Lady though fate has bid us part Yet still thou art as dear- As fixed to this devoted heart As when I clasped you here. I plunged into the busy crowd, And smiled to hear thy name, And yet as if I thought aloud They know me still the same. And when the wine-cup passes round, I toast some other fair; But when I ask my heart the sound Thy name is echoed thare . And when some other name I learn And try to whisper love, Still will my heart to the return Like the returning dove; In vain I never can forget And would not be forgot, For I must bear the same regret Whatever may be my lot. Even as the wounded bird would seek, His favorite bower to die So lady I would with you speak And give the parting sigh. If other guests should come I'd deck my hair And choose my newest garments from the shelf When though art bidden I would clothe my heart With holist purpose as for god him self. For them I wile the hours with tale or song Or web of fancy, fringed with careless rhyme, But how to find a fitting lay for thee, Who hast the harmonies of evry time. God bless you darling when the morn Shames far away the mist of night And trails above the waving corn Her gorgeous glory robes of light. God bless you when the sunset tints Warm the high battlements of heaven, As day a fond warm kiss imprints Upon the gentle brown of even. God bless you may your sleep be sweet And fraught with bright &amp; peaceful dreams. And waking may your youthful feet Tread mid lovers flowers by Crystal streams. Oh friend beloved, I sit apart and dumb Sometimes in sorrow, oft in joy divine, My lips will falter, but my prison'd heart Springs forth to measure its faint pulse with thine.</field>
