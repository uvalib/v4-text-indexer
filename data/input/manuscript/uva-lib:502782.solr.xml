      <field name="fulltext">June 29 th Stevens Camp Dear Friend;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I doubt not that you would be glad to hear from your old friend by this time, who is now enjoying the pleasures or miseries of Camp life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am very well at present, was not for several days after, I overlook my company, which is now stationed 4 miles from Martinsburg, Beverly Co. some 6 miles from the Potomac; we are getting pretty close to the Yankees. But the closer we apprach them the faster they retreat. I like camp life very much if it was not for cooking. I wish you could come down &amp; cook for me. I have engaged one young lady to fight for me. She was so kind &amp; patriotic as to offer her services, &amp; of course I could not refuse. I think most of the ladies are more patriotic than some of the Gentlemen. I met with a great many of my old acquaintances in the different regiments stationed here, which makes it more pleasant than it otherwise would be. They all seem very cheerful &amp; lively, and most anxious to come into deadly conflict with their enemy. I know I dont want to fight. I'm a great lover of peace, I would give a million, if I had it, to be in Lincoln's position one day, peace would come, if I could bring it. I abhor the idea of war, &amp; believed once that it was morally wrong on all occasions. But this war is certainly a holy &amp; just one, on our side; the other is none else than unconstitutional, brought on by wicked usurpation of power, but from present indications &amp; from reports now current, the prospect for peace is flattering. I only hope the present Congress will settle the whole affair. It is the will of our maker to have peace at all times, if people would not become so rebellious, he would not chastise so severely as by bringing war upon them. These have been in times past &amp; must needs now be. Two ladies from Washington came to Martinsburg, stated that the Cabinet were writing out a proclamation of peace. I dont know how they know it, but suppose they had some good reason for believing so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There are some hard customers here, care for nothing whatever, themselves nor any one else.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would rather be at College about this time, at my studies. I hated worse to leave them, than I hated to leave my friends. I had hoped the whole time &amp; still hope that this terrible calamity will be averted from our once glorious country, but now agitated &amp; dissevered. I was well taken care of from Staunton to Winchester by two young ladies, I recon recon you think they had a heap to do. I did not start as soon from home as I had expected to do, from some mismanagement. I have not seen John but once since I've been here; went over this morning to see him, but this was wash day with him. He is well, or at least I've heard nothing the contrary. 3 of our men were shot a few days ago, one by a Yankee &amp; the other two accidentally. All of them still living but badly wounded. We have religious services in our company every night, conducted by different members of the company, had two sermons last Sabbath. Have no regular chaplain, as I know of. You must excuse this short &amp; badly written epistle. I have now an opportunity of sending it to watch for opportunities to send mail as the mail is not regularly brought. You must remember me. My love to whom you please. Direct to Martinsburg, Care of Capt J.J. White. Write soon. It will be a great pleasure to me to hear from you any time. I have heard nothing from the neighborhood since I've been here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I remain your friend sincerely Jno. P. Lightner</field>
