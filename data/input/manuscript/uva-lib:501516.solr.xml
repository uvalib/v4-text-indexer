      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Jan 12 th 1862 Dear Charlie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Are you of the opinion that it is wrong to indulge in letter writing on the sabbath? What ever may be your thoughts that is one of my failings, if failings it may be called. Although I have written once to Charlie since I received a letter from him I thought, as I was writing to Hallie , that I would end a few lines to my "second brother". I wrote you a few lines and sent by John Chaffee or Joe Davis .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This is an awful gloomy day, windy and rainy as ever.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wrote you of the illness of one of my schoolmates, Sadie Heslip . I called to see her today and found her now better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie every day brings to view more &amp; more the awful verge on which our loved and wretched country is trembling. Although I am ashamed to own it yet it is nevertheless true that before this awful rebellion broke out I cast no reflections upon this, our America . I only thought of it as a good and righteous government, I lived only for myself nor even dreamed that war that worst of all evils could inhabit its land and although I cannot sympathize, even now, with our country as some can and do, yet- I feel its awful effects most deeply. I sometimes think that it is more for my friends that I care than for my country. It seems natural but it may not be right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I have had time to consider. When Hallie told us that he had enlisted it seemed all a horrible dream. I did not realize the con sequences that might follow. But I tremble when I think of it. When do you think you can get furlough to come and make us a visit. I heard that the seventh had been ordered from Romney to Kansas but doubt it some I do hope you will come before Laura and I start for Oberlin which we intend doing in a little more than a month. But it is growing too dark to write much more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurie sends love. Please give my kind regards to Geo. Moore and all others whom I know. How does Seth Conn enjoy himself was he married when he was home last summer? You rem ember you thought he would be.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close Please write very often to your friend and sister Addie</field>
