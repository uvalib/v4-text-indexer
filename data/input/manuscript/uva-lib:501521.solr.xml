      <field name="fulltext">Mecca February 9th 1862 My Darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Grays Ohio is deficient in paper mills" will be the first exclamation which passes Charlies's lips on the receival of this. I did not know that I was so very destitute of paper until I went to my desk and lo! sheet was to be found but I feel lonesome and thought I would resort to some remedy The best one I have know of, or the best one within my reach is this one. Your "good works" of the 26th &amp; 2 8 th arrived the same day, friday. It is almost useless to tell you they were joyfully received for that would not expess one tenth part of my feelings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not think I suffer needlessly on you account for it you knew my heart and knew how I love the image engraved there you would not wonder at my anxiety for your safety How happy I am darling in this new love, reciprocated with so much tenderness and devotion. But my mind is wandering from the answer to your letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie your "abrupt question" seemed but an echo to one I have often asked myself in reference to you and that it this How did the noble Charlie Tenney ever chance to love such a little country rustic like myself. The only answer that I can give is that you were so good I could not help but love you The only difficulty I could find was that it was too easy. I am not ashamed of you far from it. I am proud of my darling. You seem to be quite discontented with your and monotonous life I can not blame you either, I know how anxious you must be to have this unholy I can call it no better, war close. I too am very impatient to see the end, but Him alone can tell I was greatly surprised at your informing me of your new correspondent and far greater the surprise when I discovered that you had enclosed in your Miss. Holcomb's letter. I was almost pained when I read of your letters being subject to my supervision. Darling do you think that I have no confidence in the one to whom I have given my love? Do you think I can not trust the man whom I believe the noblest, the best of human beings, to correspond with a lady friend without my eyes scrutinizing every ine that is written? God forbid. Never never would I bestow upon you such an ungrate- ful heart. I would be in the of the betrayed then that of the betrayer. Now dearest please do not, unless you wish her letters preserved and think I can better do it than you send me any more of Miss Holcomb's letters. I ask it as a simple request will you grant it? Only relieve your confidence in as unhesitating manner as I have given mine and I will be happy. Bless you darling, I have correspondents in the army besides my darling one in South Carolina -- W. J. Donald- son -- the other in Mansas, Milton Irwin . I had not thought of gaining your consent before writing to them, but if you will not take it as an insult, Addie will say one of her prettiest pleases and say "Please Mr. Tenney may I correspond with Will -- my "Good Templar " brother, and Miltie -- my little playmate? and if she could she would give one of her sweetest kisses, which is a great sacrifice for I never kiss only my papa and brother Remmington I mean . If you wish it I will send all of my letters that I get from them and also all of my answers for Heaven knows that I would not wrong you so much as to write them anything that I would not show to the world if necessary. Do not be offended with me will you darling for this answer. I could not bear that thought of your sending all of her letters for my inspection and remem ber Addie wishes you to write to her or any other lady just as you see fit. I know your true heart well enough to know that you would not wrong me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(3rd) Our friend Dora is well and the same good girl that she was last fall. Her brother is in Claridon . Her parents have moved there and she is keeping house for her brother Orin Leaslie Mecca Oh! yes I do remember Channey Bown , by the bye, he was one of my "instant admirers" I did not return the compliment very well for I did not like him. Of the two I thought more of Seth than of Channey letters have been published urge of you once more to your Hallie has written letters to you, he says since he came home. You say darling that you was gratified to know that your rehersal of your first life strengthened my confidence in you. I will answer just as I felt when reading that rehersal also when you asked me if I could accept of you knowing all this accept of you just as you are This one thought presented itself Are the less beautiful because a cloud is over them thus you are to me. Are you less worthy because you have sorrows? No, indeed. I love you better for it. Are you satisfied with my answer? I do not wish any references to establish your character and integrity. If I cannot love you as you are without inquiring of this fickle world whether you are the man that I can love or not I will strive to forget that I ever was. Father always said I was too confiding in those I love but I do not believe it. There are but few people in this world that I do love I have but few, what is termed confidential friends indeed out of there are but two my own relation lady friends I mean of course I have no confidential male friends beside my brother and the other ones to whom I would reveal one of my hearts secrets one is Dora the other Miss Lenny Leagan the latter is Laurie's confidential friend. Darling I was deeply interested in your religious sentiments and I was thankful for them. I had often thought of sending you a Bible but the thought that you certainly possessed one restrained me. I was surprised and astonished when you wrote that there was not one christian in your company. I shudder when I think of the end I would urge your return much more than I now do, but I do</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(4) not wish to make you dis- contented but I should be very very happy to see you is fast approaching. Lehent Briggins keep his of you often! Why darling I should have been more suprised if you had told me to forget more often than I was at that I think of you often! you are in my thoughts but night and by day. Thank God for dreams dearest for then you are with me. I have the music to "Dixie' but not the words. If I can get "Ever oft thee" at the music store I will do so and play it for your sake. Laurie thoughtful as ever Charlie I have a to give you some day of my black eyed sister. I will tell you what robbed her of her girlhood but I have neither time nor dispo - sistion to tell you now besides I wish to reserve it for the happy time when you come home What a gay and careless girl she was one year ago how changed! Instead of the gay and light-hearted girl, she is now the sad thoughtful woman she is at times now gleeful and "funny" but she is not truly happy, when she away from excitement there will be such a mournful longing expression in her grave black eyes that my heart aches for her but I will tell my story if I am not careful Laurie is well or was this morning Did you know she was more than half in love with my brother? But what am I writing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">says that I am very much obliged for Mr. Tenney's love and return mine also my best wishes really auntie is getting Laurie sends love she say tell him to give my respects to Remember me to the boys and give my love to the one I send it to.</field>
