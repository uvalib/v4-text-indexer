      <field name="fulltext">Goldsboro March 29 1865 Dear Father:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your letters of the 15 Jan. and 21st Feb. on our arrival here 2 days ago. I am very well and have been on our march and hope that you may all be the same. After having been cut off from the civilized world for nearly 2 months we have again a chance to communicate with our friends at home. Another terrible blow has been struck at the reeling con federacy and I suppose that Sherman has halted only to gather new strength to strike another and more destructive one than the last. It is understood that Sherman has gone to Fortress Monroe. I could not vouch for the truth of it. I cannot tell how long we will remain here, but I don't expect to stay long. Schofield first occupied Goldsboro. We were fighting the rebels at the time about 28 miles northwest of the town which were concentrated there. It was the only fight of any magnitude that we had. Johnston is said to have had about 40,000 men. The rebels the first day of the fight rather whipped the 14 and 28th Corps from all reports. I don't know as it was any victory to the rebels but the 2 Corps were brought to a halt and that is so unusual that we termed it a whip. I can show the position occupied at the first day's fight. [1] The rebels decidely outnumbered the 2 Corps. Reports say that they charged the 14 Corps 4 times, they were all impregnated with a solution of gunpowder and whisky. The 14 Corps had rail barricades and killed a great many of the rebels. They shot deliberate, nearly all the rebels were hit in the breast or head, but you will learn all this from your papers. I wish we had the same privilege of reading the news that you have, a paper is a rarity. I think that there is a good prospect of having peace before long. I think that the rebellion is played out, as the term is in the army. I g ue ss that Davis, Lee and crew begin to see that it is a failure and I am satisfied that the southern people and the privates in their army almost exclusively desire peace. As they fail we gain strength. There never was an army more confident than Sherman 's. I believe that when he leaves here he will have an army sufficient to cope with the whole confederate army of Lee , Johnston combined.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As regards the money I have sent home I am willing that Henry shall have it to use for to stock his farm or any thing other good use. It is as good lent to him as to any other man.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have several other letters to write. I suppose that I will write to Joseph Wood if he desires it. I received a letter from Clemmy and also from Samuel Brown. You never sent me any newspapers as you said you would. They would be very acceptable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must conclude, Charles B. Senior To all at home.</field>
