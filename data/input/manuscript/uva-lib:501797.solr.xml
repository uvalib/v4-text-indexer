      <field name="fulltext">Norwood Aug. 18. 1856. My dear brother Joseph,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your very interesting letter came safely to hand and I expected to reply to it by last mail but was prevented from so doing and must now do what I have so long neglected doing. But first to our busineſs: a letter of Mrs. Carrs arrived by the same mail that yours did and that has all been attended to; a draft has been for- warded to her for $75 on your aſc in payment of your bill with her for the last half of your last seſsion with her as boarder &amp;c. No doubt the bill is all correct. You are charged with wood also — but credited only by $20. This renders it neceſsary to curtail my remittance to you and therefore enclosed you have one draft for $75 being as much as I could well remit you at present. I hope it may answer your purposes for the present. The draft will paſs for money with any accommodating merchant who has opportunities to present it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I had to draw yesterday on my merchant for $75 for Mrs. Carr &amp; for $308.13 in favor of the New Market merchants, so you see this is going it right hard. Though I send you a small amt this time I hope you will apply it to your little outstanding debts at once and I will give another and I hope a better lift as soon as poſsible, if needed. I take the liberty of repeating it, apply it at once. Rather than be in debt to any man I would pay him every three cent piece I could fairly get hold of until the whole was liquidated; moreover people will complain when put off too long. I use this language here not for your benefit but for mine, just to show you my abhorrence of too long protracted debts. My Father is the only man I cant keep even with, he will keep me in debt to him and I fear it will be so at his death, though I shall make every effort to become clear of debt even to him. Now, dont you turn upon me and say, 'brother, where is my rent money' — remember that is due 1 Jany. 1857 but I expect to pay the whole of it before that time if needed by you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I paid Henry Felix $3.77 for you. The poor fellow has been entirely broken up by being presented at court for sell- ing spirits. A very good thing, though I was sorry for him for he was under the impreſsion that D. Cabell had procured a licence with the money which he had given him, but which afterwards proved not to be enough &amp; licence was not procured. He was presented by Eubanks (who, I believe, voted for license, but) who very recently lost a valuable carpenter by this rotten stuff of "Sternes &amp; Brummels." Fellow drank himself to death — when turn- ed over in the road not leſs than 1 qt. of brandy poured from his mouth. Many negros have been killed by it in this county. There is no doubt about its being poisonous. I expect the court will let Felix off with the fine. Every thing he owned belonged to my Father &amp; Mr Brown; so, rather than have him sold out by others they moved the contents of his store to Shipman &amp; Cabells.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You make some enquiry about Davy in your last letter; he is now quite sick I believe on account of being too imprudent in eating directly after his spell. I fear this relapse will go hard with him. You know he always had a good appetite and since his fever and long abstinence from food you can judge how he commenced in this line when he was able to get out. I sincerely hope he will not be as sick, as he has been, from this late imprudence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are having now the most tremendous rain which will help our Tobacco and corn very much. Both of mine want help. My wheat will average fully 8 b to 1 b sowed. Ask Uncle Wood if his crop averaged as well. I will have a large crop of corn — but my highland corn is much injured for want of rain. Tell him also that I did not use 1 lb of guano on my land and never have. My usual average is 10 b to 1 b sowed. My neigh- bor, Mr Bruce McClelland sowed $300 worth of guano and my average doubles his.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am becoming more &amp; more interested in farming and more and more attached to my native county and to all those whom I hold most dear just around me. The needle does not tremble to the pole with more certainty than my heart beats with love for the home of my birth and for those whom I have lived with from my infancy up. And I am glad to see that you cherish such feelings. Your letter was deeply interesting to me — until you got to "Matrimony" where you evidently exposed yourself. I hope you will let me know, my dear brother, as soon as poſ- sible what sad fate has befallen you. in this line. 24-bit 300 dpi Detail of page 4 of autograph letter, signed, showing insertion written along right margin. For heaven sake change your views on this subject and believe that nothing will so conduce to your happineſs and peace of mind than this! Come back with your licence and take up your quarters with me and in leſs than one month all your foolish notions on this score will be entirely gone. If you want to "preserve your honor, preserve your property and integrity" get married .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I expect you would slip your neck into the Hymeneal noose with great promptneſs if you should get a good opportu- nity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give much love to Henry; he is now a most respectable man though his bridal carriage is broken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Father went up to see sister last sunday — they were all quite well there. Father is as busy as ever and I believe is now putting an end to all buildings from home and I hope soon to see him pay exclusive attention, so far as build- ing is concerned, to " Norwood " Union Hill &amp; " Collington ." This would be very well .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have improved Norwood very much lately by cutting out the trees and cleaning up. I insist upon it that the credit of cleaning up belongs exclusively to one — Bettie Give much love to all at Roanoke — I would like to see them all over here so much. Bettie is well and sends much love also.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yr aff. brother. Willm. D Cabell</field>
      <field name="fulltext">N.B. Bettie desires me to state that "both pictures came duly to hand, the glaſs to the larger one being tetotally smashed " She hopes you will excuse her negligence in not having acknowledged the receipt before.</field>
