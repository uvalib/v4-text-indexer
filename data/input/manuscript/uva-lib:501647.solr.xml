I have no idie how long we can stay here we are under marching orders now. we have to move as the enemy moves, it was thought that thay were going to atact us yesterday though thay did not. thay came over last tues day and gave our cavilry a verry hard fight thay faught nearly all day. took our men on seprise and got the advantage an the start, though our men drove bac across the river at last, thay took some prisners and horses, our men took between three and four hundered pris ners, I dont serpose thay made much by that move, thay have bin sending thair cavilry throug through the country to steal and destroy every thing can, thay take all the negroes and hosses away with and burn the meat corn wheat and flour thay can find. I have bin to several houses whare the yankees had taken every thay had. you all think you have great deal to see trouble about though you have nothing campared to those that live near the line of the enemy, the yankees is geting too mean to live, I thinke thay are depending altogether apan them selves for thair inde pendence, and we all know that is a poor dependence for eney people to depen apon, I still live in hope of peace soon though I may not live to see it,</field>
