I have often though about your pains. I hope you do not suffer any more with them. I have so much to do this week that I think it will be imposible for me to get down before Saturday week. The time will appear very long to me I am sure. But it will soon run round as I have a good eal to attend to. I hope my darling will try &amp; be hapy cheerfull &amp; sadisfied. oh how often I think of a sigh that escaped you while I was down last. I hope &amp; pray that some day I may be able to command any thing you desire. I will close by asking God to protect us from all harm I will write again &amp; a longer letter before I come down.
