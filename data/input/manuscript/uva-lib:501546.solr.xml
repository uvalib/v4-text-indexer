      <field name="fulltext">"School home" June 18 th , '62 My darling Charley,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your welcome letter of the 6 th I received last eve, I had become quite despondent. as so long a time had passed since having from you. I and my anxiety was still more increased when I read a letter from GCalhi . I knew by the why his question. "Have you heard from Charlie lately" was asked. That he too had not heard from you for some time. But the missin has at last come. How thoughtful I was for it dearest. I am very nervous this morning as I have walked more than a mile. I did not think you ungrateful. I knew you were constantly on the move and attributed your silence to that yet. Let us frame what excuses I would at times I was very lonely. Often I would picture you as on the march, weary and oppressed with burdens, when I would sigh and wonder that I would not hear some of the fatigues of your duty . Darling, if I would become yours at the class of my school, would you later on with you to share your bridals? But what an absurd question. I know that I would only be a kinderance to you and therefore I meant be contented where I now am, it is very hard thing to talk about contentment when the one I love is many miles away uncaring all his life in the service of his country. Contentment! let those who know not the meaning of love, and who have no friend for which I waited and pray talk of contentment! I can not be contented. Let me say ever so hard, I do not wonder at your indignation. I too was very indignant when I read that the rebels had again entered Winchester . The place where you suffered so much. Well these will sometimes be never seen in war as well as any other Island . Cowards! indeed what a shame. If after marching day after day. your and being compell ed to stop through exhaustion if such are ed cowards. Then darling I am thankful that you are a coward . Yes, darling. I do wonder that you blush at the thoughts. If this makes you a coward. I am proud of and a coward. I had feared that your health would fail. but no wonder you have been through enough within the past years to war and any constituition . I am very sorry for Will Braden . How I would like to be with the sick soldiers. I believe I could do some good these. I think it a shame to our government that our sick soldiers are so neglected. Does Sam expect his men to fight if they are not cared for three months seems a long time to wait so tortured with fear and anxiety as I at time am, but I will try and wait patiently trusting in. Him who doth all things well I asked Dora last eve if she would write to you but (obstinate little thing that she is, she refuses. I do not know the reason. What a question you asked me If "I would be willing to my most intimate friend write to my Charlie . Why should I and; She is a dear little friend and I love her as a sister. You will too when you become acquainted with her. Dear Charley , "1 st of July" is almost here do you think you will be here on that day? She seldom asked me to day if I should teach on that memorable day. I did not till thin bul- in all probability you are here I should. What think you of that do you not see how much depends upon your coming! Oh, fri! why do I jest about that subject more very much more depends upon it than one day school. I am confident that many happy hours do, at least. So you have been to Manassas Junction have you. Did you imagine you saw a bird furnished brings flying as they did at the fights? I should have to visit Mrs. Washington 's grave. We have shocking accounts of the mutilation of her monument by the rebels. 1 Is it true? It is almost school time dear and I will write some more this evening I do not feel very well to day. I feel vivid and warm and- perhaphs I read too much but I am very much interested in Good rich's Universal History which I am now read- ing and can hardly find time to sleep Mrs. Seski told me one day that she would not let me take a light to my room if I did not cease reading so much. Kind was it not? But I begin to think she is right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good bye till night darling. Think of Addie often and send your thoughts. A Love</field>
