      <field name="fulltext">Wayland, April 23 d 1878</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It would be more proper to write Dear Mi≈øs Brooks; but, in memory of the old times, when I called you Mam'selle Sac, such an address seems too formal. Moreover, it does not represent the affectionate feelings with which the memory of you is surrounded. So, though we are both white-headed, let the girlish epithet remain. We are both children in heart .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I intended to have written to you before I left Boston, but I kept hoping the proof-sheets would be so arranged as to admit my naming a day for coming to Medford; but things did not happen as I expected. Then came the hurry and fatigue of packing and removing. Mrs. Pickering went on a visit to Maynard. I came to Wayland. It rained two days. I slept in the house of a neighbor, but spent the days in my desolate old nest. Being unable to obtain any sunshine and dry air, I kept fires a going, upstairs and down-stairs, while I unpacked innumerable things, aired the bedding &amp;c. &amp;c. When the evenings came, I was too tired to write a letter. I dropped asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow, and slept the sound sleep of labor. When Mrs. Pickering arrived, on the fourth evening, everything in the garden was suffer- -ing for want of attention, and temporary labor was very difficult to be obtained; so I went to digging and planting. I do not yet see my way out of the wood; and I feel compell- -ed to relinquish the idea of going to Medford this Spring.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The garden, in which my kind old mate and I worked together for so many years, interests me but little now; and I cannot work in it with so much vigor as I used to; but I occupy myself with it, because it is necessary to do something to keep away desolate thoughts; and air and sunshine conducive to health mental and bodily. I try very hard to travel through the remainder of my pilgrimage with brave resignation; but the way is lonely, and my old feet are weary. But strength will be renewed there beyond. Meanwhile, I must try to help other pilgrims, whose strength does not hold out even so well as mine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What a photographer Memory is! How plainly I can see dear old Medford, and the people who were walking about its streets, sixty years ago! Governor Brooks, and Dr. Osgood stand as distinctly before me, as the Wayland neighbor who is now passing. What a picture-gallery the soul will carry with it, when it goes hence! Well, we shall soon get there, and see all the life-pictures we have been unconsciously making. Till then, let us keep up good courage, and help others all we can!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please give my love to the Lincolns, the Hallowells, and Mrs. Hastings, and believe me ever your affectionate old friend. L. Maria Child</field>
