      <field name="fulltext">Camp Kelley Va. Jan 18th 1862 My dearest Addie:-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your favor of the 12th inst. is at hand, and I have made it a rule to answer promptly all letters from my Addie consequently I now apply myself to the very pleasant task of addressing a few lines to you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As all is known, now, dear Addie need we have any secrets? I mean as regards the feelings predominant in our hearts. Addie, I cannot refrain from telling you all. Pardon me, I love you , Addie, not with that momentary effervessence of feeling, common among boys, but with a pure. fervent affection, which comes welling up from my heart, all unbidden, but irresistable. It may perhaps be wrong -- you are far above me, in worth and position -- but my love is from the heart, and ? increases in strength daily. Addie is in my thoughts by night and by day. But for thy darling letters, and the impression on my heart when I saw you -- I might have become demoralized and lost forever. Addie, do I love in vain? Do my feelings meet with no response in your heart? With you, dear Addie rests my future. Will it be a happy one, happy in your love or must I be doomed to live a wretched miserable life. with no one to love, or to care for me? I shall wait anxiously for an answer, dear Addie, will it be a favorable one?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My position in life, it is true, is not an elevated one, but I know and feel that I shall make a mark in life. God has given me talents and I shall improve them I love you, Addie, and nothing else Dare I hope that I am loved in return</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not censure me, Addie, but remember that I have none to love or care for me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must, however reluc- tantly, turn to other subjects. My mind is so tumultuous that I can think of nothing interesting to write. You asked me if Seth Coon got married. No, I believe not. He says that engagement was broken off. and a new one formed in another direction ! We must possess queer sentiments in regard to such affairs, dont you think so? A person so unstable in character as that, I have but little sympathy for. The Seventh is in the third brigade, (Tyler's) of the Shenandoah (Landing) department. It consists of the 7th Ohio, 7th Indiana, 1st Virginia and the 110th Pennsylvania Regts. the "Bloody Seventh," (ours) on the right.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. Hallie is nearly well, and encloses a line. Hoping to soon recieve an answer confirming my hopes. I remain yours affectionately and forever Charlie N. Tenney. To. dear Addie .</field>
