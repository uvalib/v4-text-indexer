      <field name="fulltext">Camp Tyler, near Paw-Paw, Va,. Feby. 26 th 1862 My dearest Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Few, very very few, have as kind or as good a friend as I find in my darling Addie. Again I was made happy by the reception of a letter from her whom my heart holds very dear &amp; near. There being no more pleasant duty before me this evening, I devote it to communicating my scattered thoughts, per paper to you. Now do not imagine that there is any duty, which, in pleasure, comes between us, for such is not the case,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, are you not suffering too much, needlessly on my account? I can scarcely blame you, either, for I know what thoughts must present themselves, at times, but do not imagine that I am unwell for I claim to be as healthy a member of the Regt. as our Company affords. Hallie well knows this, and will assure you that such is the case. I have not been unwell--so to speak-- since I have been in the service. How strange that you have not recieved a letter from me for so long a time. I wrote to you. I wrote you a letter the 1 st of this month, again on the 15 th , and the 23 d Inst. I wrote again. But I will write every day If you do not recieve my letters until you do. Capt Arper has returned, and gave me the letter also the picture of My Addie . How beautiful! Addie--an abrupt question--how did you ever happen to love such a verdunt -looking ( and acting too ) and homely person as C,N,Tenney? Are you sorry you ever con= sented to correspond with him? I'm not , I'll assure you</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But what nonsense I am writing. Are you not ashamed of me? I must tell you what we have to do now While other troops are winning imperishable names in our countrys cause, the gallant " 3 d Brigade. " is busily engaged in the laudable enterprise of eating Uncle Sam's provisions , and in drilling , though what to prepare us for, I scarcely know, unless it is that we may present a military appearance when we come home, covered with the honors of War . The order of the day, as read at Parade is as follows.-- Reveille &amp; Roll Call--6 A.M. Surgeon's Call--(for the sick) 8.-- First signal for Guardmounting-- 8.30 Guardmounting 9.-- Company Drill from 9.30 to 11.-- Dinner &amp; Roll call 12.M. Company drill from 1 to 2 P.M.-- Adjutant's Call, 4.-- Dress Parade 4.30-- Retreat 6.-- Tattoo &amp; Roll Call 8.30 Extinguish lights, 9. Thus you percieve that our time is pretty well occupied. We ought to be able soon to "face the enemy" will we not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must tell you something which I should have mentioned before, and would, had I though of ever hearing from it again. It is this. Sergt. Moore, who by the way was rather dispirited--&amp; myself, at my suggestion--(which was made for his benefit)--wrote a letter each. he one to Miss Julia A. Prentiss, &amp; I to Miss Luancie Holcomb, &amp; sent them to Oberlin. Never expecting to hear from mine , I was surprised on recieving a reply the 22 d Inst. I hesitated some time before answering it, but having commenced it. I considered it ungentlemanly to neglect answering it. so wrote again. Hal told me who to write to, &amp; named her . I send you the letter as I recieved it, &amp; and Hal has a synopsis of my reply which he will show you. Will you please preserve the letters, (for I will send you all I get) as I may have occasion to return them which is Nothing unlikely. If you desire it, I will instantly discontinue the correspondence. I ought never to have commenced it, I know, without your consent, but Hallie told me to, &amp; I wrote to please him, &amp; interest my friend Moore. I will be guided by your decision. Shall I immediately cease writing, or may I continue the correspondence in a reserved manner ? subject to your supervision? Her letter is a very sensible one but is not one twentieth part as pretty, or good as your beautiful letters. By the Bye, how does Dora do? I consider her my friend, as she is yours . How is her brother, Alexander? &amp; what is he doing?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You spoke of certain remarks made while writing your letter. Similar ones are being made now. One, Charlie Perky says "That is rather fine writing for a soldier." Jack Pollock says "he must be writing to his duck." Seth says "give her my best wishes." Ben. Willson (spelled wrong) says, "I wish I was home with my love" "Charlie Campbell says "How I would like to draw mine to my throbbin bosik bosick ." Dont you think we have a loving set?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You remember Chauncey Corn, do you not? He is here in the 29 th and is now Orderly of Co. A. of that Regt. He was over here a day or two since, and requested me to give you &amp; Laurie his kind regards. Loren is here too in the same company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask me if we have plenty of reading here. We have only the papers which come now and then, from which we obtain the news. Home papers we are glad to see, but books can not be easily carried, consequently it is better that they should be reserved until we get home. Your kind offer to send me some books gratified me much, and I thank you very much for it</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do any of my the communications from "Julius" find their way into print? I have not seen the C- since the 12 th Inst.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why does Hallie not answer some of the numerous letters which I have written him? Is he at home now? I directed his letter to Warren.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I guess Mr. Benton is not very anxious to hear from me again, for I have not heard from him yet. I wrote at his request, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Is your Auntie well? and Laurie? How is Miss Hegloss now? you must write me all interesting news.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I must close as it is now tatoo over in the 29th and will soon be here, and we must all be in line.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write soon &amp; often to your</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Loving Charlie W. Tenney Am I not a fancy Pennman! P.S. Will Braden &amp; Sergt Moore send their kind regards My love to all.</field>
