      <field name="fulltext">I received your very dear letter of 24 last Wednesday never was a letter read with more interest than that; it found me enjoying the best of health one of our dear Saveirs best blessing (but how unworthy am I for it) I can say dear brother that I was truly glad to hear from you &amp; do thank my heavenly Father that he put it in your dear good heart to write Willie dear boy I have wronged you will you forgive me I believe I have found forgiveness in the dear Lord but will you forgive for I have been the cause of all this trouble Oh dear brother it will kill me if you dont forgive; just to think that I am the cause of my dear bosom companions being lost, eternially lost. Oh my dear dear Savier pitty &amp; forgive for I will give you my life for the salvation of that dear soul yes dear brother I will spend &amp; be spent for you though the more abundantly I love you the less I be loved; I deserve nothing but your hatred &amp; contempt can I ever be happy again not untill I see the dear one changed yes a Christian. Yes my dear brother if you allow me to call you thus last year you started out with prospects bright &amp; allureing &amp; these were your words Kate I am going to make or brake &amp; for w home for what for an unworthy creture as I (me) that did not deserve the notice of a cat let alone the notice of one so pure so noble so good at heart as thou all went on well prospect bright &amp; brighning grain came in on evry side I must surely be the happiest man living. Oh is this not flattering it is (like) an ideal lover or will be soon but hark I hear a noise &amp; in come a fine looking old gent ( Ah the serpent coils in eden bows) Well Mr B dont you want to go in pardnership with me you will make mony at it; at what why haveing your grain distilled I wont go I must make my money some other way my good heart &amp; God sais I must not go Ah come dont listen at that you will make enough soon to get married Ah that is charming well I must wait a while &amp; yes I must go &amp; see K &amp; see what she sais about it Pa &amp; K both oppose dont care so much for Pa but K is the one he lays it all out in flattering terms she said do as you pleas &amp; Mr B sais at last consented &amp; his word goes as far as mine with with me &amp; farther too; he goes back but concience &amp; Pa sais dont go but I am doing it for K when he gets back serpent enters what say you well I dont know I believe I will; well lets draw the article but we must have a dram first no I dont indulge her come going in do such business &amp; dont last &amp; yourself besides you have a cough &amp; it will help it; well K told me to take somthing for my cough &amp; that is the very thing any thing for K all done for K. come Mr B there is a party a head tonight lets go no I dont care about it I just got a leter from K &amp; she is very cold &amp; indifferent she is always writing something about some nice fellow or her dear friend R that I dont blieve she thinks as much of me as she ought I will go &amp; a way he goes come Mr B join in the dance I can't come ah well I will K is perhaps having her fun I will to drove away sorrow Mr B you are very lively to night but it is all put on what is the matter with you well I will tell you I fear my first love is blasted Oh my dear her then thou only knows the agony of that dear heart. Soon the serpent goes to K he has done his will with B he tell her that B has got to drinking she writes a hasty &amp; insulting letter &amp; it insults &amp; wonds B sais I dont care I will go &amp; see her &amp; quit her at once I have done all this for her &amp; this is the thanks I got he comes but love &amp; pitty enters that good heart I will tell her all my bad deeds &amp; she will turn me off but instead it bound her nearer to him &amp; what next the serpent is at work he tell K much &amp; she believes &amp; what is the consecuence God knows she suffers for it but is she a lone no no Oh she ought to be she diserves it all &amp; more but enough of this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My dear brother I take up your letter to read it &amp; how must I write can I answer it you have used cander you dont love me &amp; can I blame you Oh you hate me what must I do Oh my dear Jesus wont thou help me and direct me Willie wont you try to love me if I be a better girl you asked me once to try &amp; love you &amp; I did. brother you may you have been laughed at &amp; ridiculed here lately for your indifference for company; well you are not alone for I have been all that &amp; more scolded &amp; threatened to be whipped for it &amp; what is it for not for the worldly happiness of any one but it is for the salvation of a dear soul the one who I have been the cause of being lost what is worldly happiness compared with this eternity how long Oh how long shall we not meet in heaven where there are no changes no sin &amp; sorrow known Oh my dear brother meet Oh meet me there .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Billie you say you fear the consequences of marrying when your affections are not settled, I acknowledge I am not smart but do you think for one moment that I would marry a man that did not love me no I never expect to find one that really does therefore I expect to remain single &amp; try &amp; make myself useful to my fellow cretures one mans happiness is enough for me to distroy I have sown my wild oats &amp; now I expect to live a resigned life though it may be very short yes soon I may sleep beneath the say but I can say with a thankful heart Oh death where is they sting A grave where is thy victory but enough</field>
