      <field name="fulltext">Camp Tyler, Va. Feby 28th 1862 My own loved Addie ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your longed for letter came to hand tonight, and now I can resort to my favorite pasttime - There! Dont that look fine with 2 ts? this evening, that of writing, also my duty in answering your kind letter. Perhaps you would like to know what part of your letter interested me most. I will tell you. I was gratified to know that my rehearsal of my past life, strengthened you confidence in me, which I never doubted . before.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I had feared that it might pain you and situated as I am, not on amieable terms with my father's family, I could not refer you to them to establish my character. I have always tried to maintain strict integrity , all my life, yet being alone, it is natural for people to distrust one, on that account. This company, I think to a/man , will testify to my good behaviour, since I have been in the service.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I will change the subject. I was delighted with the description you gave me of the "Large Family." but I am sure I could not like "Mollie." She must be of a selfish nature if she could not give you an hour or two to write to those who are fighting in her behalf, to secure the priveleges she even now enjoys Not that I am selfish, but I am one of six hun= dred thousand, I have no doubt but she was charmed with your society, for who would not be? but passing the day with you, and having some slight knowledge of as to whom you were writing to. she must be selfish indeed if she could not suffer you to do even that .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must admire my letters very much to recieve them with such demonstrations of lively pleasure, now suppose you recieved such interesting and charming letters as a certain correspondent of mine-- Miss A.L. Case - writes, how would you deport yourself when they arrived? I love your letters, for they tell me I am loved, I love you , for it is right, and - you love me . God bless you , and preserve you my hearts idol, my Love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did I ever tell you my religious sentiments? I think not? That there is a good God, none can deny. That some, yes many of those who profess to have a "saving knowledge of Christ Jesus" are misguided, is a matter of as little doubt. "The Bible is true." is one of my "articles of faith." "Christ died for all," is another, "God is just," is a third. From these, you percieve I believe that the way is open for all who will , to enter Heaven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I do not profess to Love the Saviour, as I ought, but I might . I have my Bible, and I consider it the most precious of all books. Addie , there is not a ch r istian in this company! Are you astonished? Tis true . I shudder to think of the end, yet I am one of them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Addie dearest, I would give much if I could come and see you, but I cannot, yet I know that is one who remembers me, and I am happy. But I must bring this to a close, Think of me often, and remember that I am with you constantly in spirit, give my love to Bro. Hallie , Sister Laurie , Auntie, and all, and write very often to Your Charlie . P.S. Do you ever sing. "Dixie" My favorite is "Ever of thee" . Our band plays it beautifully.</field>
