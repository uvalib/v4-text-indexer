Miss Fannie Lincoln presented our company with a secession Flag. I seen her put did not no her as we pushed on so past in our press waggons we had to travel all day last Sunday which seemed very hard in old Jackson. I almost fell in love with a girl the way I happened to get acquainted with her was I had proke one of my straps that held my scabbard &amp; I just went &amp; asked her to sow it for me if she pleased. She very kindly said she would &amp; before the lady had finished it a dozen of my fellow solders had joined around me, the Ladies all along the road seemed so pleasant that it it cheered us onward thare hankerchiefs ware continually waveing &amp; we generally gave them three loud cheers. Thare are so many rumers afloat that I can not say what we may hafter do. John is very well and seemd to enjoy him self very well. I hope that if it is Gods will that we may all arrive safely at home ere long.</field>
