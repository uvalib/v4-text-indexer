      <field name="fulltext">Jan. 12th 1861 Miss Midie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In congratulation of your epistle, &amp; the interrogatives therein, which was so very striking indeed; &amp; from such, is a natural impulse on my part to respond, in my feeble way to your missive on the 21 st ult . Happy to hear of general health, &amp; the improving of Nic's mind, &amp; very sorry to hear of the casualty of Miss Sue, (on her way to visit) you which no doubt marred her enjoyment to some extent.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And so you made a break on the Creek at last: Mr. Jas. Hall. Wonder who will follow suit, as you intimated there were several talked of.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Perhaps you for one, as pictures have been passing, &amp; pressure the pen has been running too, with phrases of deepest emotion of mutual affection ha ha. "Now what do you think?" Just get the Cologne bottle, &amp; perfume for the Old Target. As for my part, my watch is dumb, &amp; horse have I not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Should liked to have taught at the Creek this winter, but could not forfeit my word, &amp; leave here. I am however very well satisfied, with neighborhood &amp; boarding residence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will have to take wills for deeds; it was out of my power to go either to singing, or to your house.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I did not get home till Sunday prior to Christmas, &amp; on Monday night had my Cousins from Illinois with me, &amp; for that reason could not go to your house on that day; in fact had company nearly every day &amp; night during the Holyday . Was at a Taffy pulling; had a fine time eating hard Molasses with unwashen hands .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you ever pull any, when you had to spit on your hands to keep it from adhering to them? "Oh where did &amp;c &amp;c What foolishings, what foolery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Eliza sends her love to you, &amp; says she is making her wedding dress, out of red calico trimmed with white strings.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hard times on this side, no doubt with you. disunion and war was the cry, &amp; now a reality. Sad thoughts, that the ties of the Republic, are busted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh Washington where are thy warnings? O Jacksons, where are you? Where is Lucian, these times; &amp; how are you &amp; he thriving these days, as you were once very intimate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Excuse all foolishness &amp; accept my kindest regards, &amp; well wishings, for your prosperity &amp; future happiness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Truly Yours, From a Friend Kate</field>
