      <field name="fulltext">I thank you my dear Angelica for your two last letters and for the Trouble you were taking to procure me the remainder of the Articals I requestd you to send out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As they have not yet arrived and as you appear to be at a loss about the lights, for want of knowing the size of my drawing room; lest any thing should have occasioned delay it may be of use to inform you the dimensions are five and twenty feet square.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We have just taken house in Markett Street nearly opposet the President who you know lives in Robert Morris house . I delivered your compliments as you wished to Mr s Washington who received them affectionately and made many enquirys after you. peggy has just left this city with M r. Rensselear having spent three weeks with us she is in good health and spirits but bears no marks of usefulness to the Commonwealth. I also continue Idle. but pray my Lady what are you a bout all this time with your grave enquierys about the success of your Sisters Labours? Mr Hamilton and I often talk a bout you with great pleasure and earnestly wish that you could again be aded to our little circle but we dare scarcely hope for so great a happiness. We will not however despair of meeting again on one or the other side of the Atlantic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God bless you my dear Angelica Yours ever Elizabeth Hamilton Remember me affectionately to M r. Church and the children.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">1791-10-02</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Betsey according to your hint cries "Atlantic" and defies any thing that either of us can say or do. She consents to every thing, except that I should love you as well as herself and this you are too reasonable to expect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I do not know how far I shall avail myself of her generosity if you do not mend your manners. You hurt my republican nerves by your intimacy with " amiable " Princes. I cannot endure that you should be giving such folks dinners, while I at the distance of 3000 miles can only console myself by thinking of you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I pray you dont let your Vanity make you forget that such folks are but men and that it is very possible that they may not be half as worthy of the good will of a fine woman as a parliament man or a Secretary of the Treasury.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You are not however to conclude from what I have said that I am in a violent fit of dudgeon with you. If it will give you pleasure assure yourself that you are as much in my good graces as ever and that you must be a very naughty girl indeed before you can lose the place you have in my affections. I earnestly join Betsey in the favorite wish that we may meet againâ€” And heaven permitting, it shall be so</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Adieu very dear sister in law A. Hamilton October 2 d . 91</field>
