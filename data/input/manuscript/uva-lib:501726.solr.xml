      <field name="fulltext">I am thus far my dear Angelica on my way to attack and subdue the wicked insurgents of the West — But you are not to promise yourself that I shall have any trophies to lay at your feet. A large army has cooled the courage of those madmen &amp; the only question seems now to be how to guard best against the return of the phrenzy. [1]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You must not take my being here for a proof that I continue a quixot. In popular governments 'tis useful that those who propose measure should partake in whatever Dangers this may involve... Twas very important there should be no mistake in the management of the affair— and I might contribute to prevent one. I wish to have every thing well settled for Mr. Church &amp; you, that when you come, you may tread on safe ground. Assure him that the insurrection will do us a great deal of good and add to the solidity of every thing in this country. Say the same to Mr Jay to whom I have not time to write &amp; to Mr Pinkney. [2]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">God bless you Dear Sister &amp; make you as happy as I wish you. Love to Mr. Church. A. Hamilton M rs A Church</field>

      <field name="fulltext">[1] Alexander Hamilton was at this time in western Pennsylvania accompanying the United States troops sent west to put down the Whiskey Rebellion that had erupted in the fall of 1794 in the counties of Westmoreland, Fayette, Washington, and Allegheny. The insurrection was precipitated by the Excise Act of 3 March 1791 that imposed substantial duties on domestically distilled spirits and provided an elaborate system for efficient collection. Violence against the collectors of the duties in July 1794 and by September had become so widespread that President George Washsington decided to send federal troops to deal with the insurgents. Secretary of the Treasury Hamlton, an outspoken critic of the opponents of the excise, accompanied the troops and the president himself accompanied them as far as Carlisle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[2] John Jay (1745-1829), at this time chief justice of the United States Supreme Court, was in England to negotiate a treaty with Great Britain to settle outstanding differences between that country and the United States. Thomas Pinckney (1750-1828) was United States minister to Great Britain.</field>
