      <field name="fulltext">THE COACH DOG</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Let youth be aware that the first impression which the world takes of us, seldom or never wears out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is a great happiness to have virtuous parents, rela- tives, tutors, and domestics, as it is from them that we re- ceive our principles and habits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We should not measure men by Sundays, without look- ing to what they do all the week after.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wish to make this little book a Register of the Negroes owned by me in Buckingham ; to insert their names and ages, and to note births and deaths among them. The master should know not only the names, but study the characters and ascertain the age of his slaves. It is important to know their age, because slaves over 16, and also between 12 and 16 are subjects of taxation ; because this knowledge is useful and necesary in the division and distribution of property ; and desirable whenever circum- =stances require that the owner should sell any of his slaves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My sons will perhaps be glad to have this information, and that alone is a sufficient reason for my undertaking to embody and transmit it for future reference.</field>
