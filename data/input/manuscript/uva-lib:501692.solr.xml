      <field name="fulltext">Zephyr Hill Nov 2 nd 1867 Dear Brother</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Although this day is sad and dreary, yet my feelings are not in accordance with it and I am attempting a reply to your last letter. I have neglected willing longer than I intended. But since I have been so actively employ- ed in the exhilarating pleasure of having chills and other circumstances connected these with, over which I had no control I know you will heartily forgive the long long delay. I just tell you I have had a rare time with them. We are all pretty well now, except uncle's health. He is quite feeble. And I suppose you have found one with whom to share the simple joys of life. I know she is May happiness attend thee and thy companion through life is my kindest wish. I wish I could have been with you all so as to witness the occasion I know you had quite a jubilee.I am not married yet. I prefer a single life yet. I think there is a good many in the war now that woul d like to get out of it. A married life is not a desirable one to me. There is no real happiness in it. Time finds me at home visiting and receiving company occasionally I expect to teach next session if I can find a suitable situation. Money is scarce here. The freedmen have done very well this year. Cotton is quite low and we have to give an exorbi- tant price for everything we get. We recieved a letter from Uncle C last week. He was compliment ing you very highly and also brother J. I often wish I could be with you all. it is a consummation devoutly to be wished. In referance to me returning to Va. I can not abhor the idea of going there with a stranger, yet I don't think there would be any unpropriety in so doing. I would rather brother would come after me if all thinks it best for me to return. I know Uncle Tom is getting old and feeble, and will be with us but a little while, at the far his rest . We all will have to rely on our own resource He has even been like a father to me in every respect. I shall ever love him although in a distant land. It will be a sore trial for me to part with him and dear old Aunt. They say I feel as dear to them as one of their children. They say they hope I will do well through life, but it seems as if the fates are against me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How were all at home when you were there</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give me a home description when you can it will be quite entertaining With many prayers for your well being and doing I am as ever your sister</field>
