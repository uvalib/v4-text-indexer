I seized the dear letters messenger &amp; with anxious eyes &amp; heart full of joy unspeakable I perused its contents with un parralelled interest &amp; pleasure the relief of my anxiety was so forcibly impressive that I could but (umanly or childish as it was) press the dear sheet to my lips &amp; cover your name with numerous kisses. I really was never more delighted at the receipt of a letter all my life. One would have supposed from emotions, that I was much in love with than that of friendship. Sweet dearest Kate you know I have long since defined my position fully, I have claimed to love you only as a friend &amp; as a proof of the fact have openly told you of my fond relations with another a friend of early life whose constancy &amp; devotion I can scarce doubt . our attachment was formed in early life. long separations during the protracted perils of war &amp; blood Shed, my reduction (by the same) to comparitive poverty has made no change in the dearest objects of my undivided affection like you my dear Sister who has proven to be a devoted friend. She too has proven to be all that one could be, who holds the place she does, in my hearts dearest affections and nothing prevents the consumation of what has been vowed between us but my limited means &amp; the depressed condition of the Country.</field>
