      <field name="fulltext">Prospect Tennessee April 14, 1864 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received your letter last night which is the second one that I have had from you since I left. If I had one each day I should not get tired of opening them &amp; reading them if they are from Iowa they are very welcome visitors but like angels visits few &amp; far between I wrote a letter to you yesterday but after I received this I thought that I must write again I have wrote quiet a number to different persons in the country but have received no answers We get mail here every day It is then taken to headquarters &amp; each company's mail given to that company's orderly &amp; then distributed by him. You Perhaps remember Stewart the man that went with Vanness when he thrashed our grain some years ago he stays in our shanty &amp; is very sick it is probably the measles that is coming upon him if that proves to be the case he will of course removed to the hospital until he recovers James Campbell &amp; Uriah A Wilson have both had them but they have got about well again I received the postage stamps that you sent me but they were so stuck together that I had to steam them to get them separated they should be doubled face to face to prevent them sticking. You said something about Leonard Parker having sold out did he ever say anything to you about some money that he owed to me for rail making I made him 1880 rails &amp; he only paid me for 1500 when he counted them There was a deep snow &amp; he did not find them all &amp; he promised if he found the rest he would hand the balance of the money to you I know that the rails are there &amp; he should have paid to you 3 dollars &amp; 80 cents perhaps he has but the next time you write let me know I have got with a good mess of boys 8 of us they are not a swearing blackguarding set at all with Stewart excepted They are quiet thereverse more inclined to study &amp; improve their mental faculties we have had several debating schools in our shanty since we came here. &amp; we study grammar some &amp; arithmetic one of our mess sent to Fowler &amp; Wells &amp; got a couple of Phonographic Books &amp; we are just beginning to see a dawn of sense in that branch We have had them only 4 or 5 days &amp; were entirely ignorant of it all of us so we are not advanced in reading or writing it yet Altogether we have received the name of the literary squad which sounds blackguarding shanty just below us which is known by the name of Gambling Saloon I have just been down to the guard house &amp; saw one from the aforesaid place with his arms tied &amp; fastened in a standing position &amp; I thought that I would sooner be studying grammar or Frognogra phy by which they try to ridicule us than to be in his place for running the picket lines or some other misdemeanor. I am perfectly well &amp; hope that this may find you all the same</field>
