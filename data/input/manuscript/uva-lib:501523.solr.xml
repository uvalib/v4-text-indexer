      <field name="fulltext">Mecca February 11 th 1862 Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I guess you will not complain because I do not write often enough. for I have sent you a letter every "mail day" for a good while. But I go upon the principle that the oftener I write the oftener I recieve and therefore I shall write real often</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How happy I was last night when I rec'd. you darling letters of the 2 nd and 3 rd I recieved two from you friday and did not expect to recieve another so soon. I thought I should not go to the office last night for it was quite muddy but something-I can call it nothing but instinct-seemed to tell me to go.. I went and my heart was gladdened . I am sure I can not tell what part of your letters interest me most for they are so full of interest that it is difficult finding the most interesting part. I was pleased with your "Diary letter" It is so different from what you generally write, but it was Charlie's letter after all. I sympathize with you in the loss of Gen. Lander but I hope your new Gen will supply his prove himself as worthy as did Gen. Leander. I believe Banks and Shields take his place do they not? I read in the Cleveland Leader that they did but the "Leader" gives us so many wrong reports that I can not believe any thing that they print unless it is authenticated in some other direction. Darling, I can not think of the battle that must be fought on the Potomac, without a shudder, and my heart clings closer to my idol. Would to God that that battle would be avoided. Surgeons are preparing to go to Washington, from all parts of the country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am so thankful that you enjoy good health, and I am glad that you are so punctual in informing me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, I do not think Hal would wish you to insure your own safety for his sak . Charlie, how your "question" startled me. I can not tell you. I had not cast a thought to avoid changing my name to the the one you have at present. I had been so happy in your love that I had thought of nothink beyond No Charlie, I must maintain the simple name of Addie Le Case until I am someting wiser, something better than I now am. I have aspirations that must be reached before I bear another name than this</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wish to make myself worthy of you my darling, before I am wholy yours. and your love will strengthen me. Be content dearest at present, and remember that it is for the best for I could never bestow my hand upon you now. My heart is already yours and even will be, but my hand may not be for years. It may seem a hard request to grant when I ask you to not mention this again until I do, but you will grant it will you not my own Charlie ! Does it seem a long time Charlie? Perhaps it does, but would you not rather wait a few years till I have a chance to cultivate the gifts God has given me than to find but too late that you have taken to your heart an unworthy object?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Consider this darling, and answer me, Hallie too, my own darling brother wishes me to become a woman in mind as well as in body before I can marry, and could I refuse a request from him ! He considers you worthy one of the noblest of women and God in Heaven helping me I will be that one. You asked me if father knew of our "carrying on" He does not He always said that his daughters would never recieve his dictation in choosing a companion, a queer person is my papa He seems to think his children capable of choosing for themselves. Perhaps he is right Did you ever see a more lovely day than this one is. It is so warm and pleasant. I can scarcely content remaining in the house. Not a cloud is to be seen and the sunshine is dashing through the windows so brightly it is such a contrast so the fire which seems feebly burning but auntie says it is burning real good and above all the birds - Earth's first and beautiful poets are singing so sweetly. I imagine they are singing just as sweet songs now as birds sang to Adam and Eve when were in the garden of Eden before that one great sin deprived them forever from of their happiness. How does Gen. Moore get along. I shall never forget his call to our house and my questions I asked him of you. I tried to appear disinterested when talking about you, but his honest blue eyes which look right into mine just as if he knew I was doing myself an injustice as well as you. He knew that we corresponded with each other when he was here. I have a curiosity to know whether that "look" is natural with him or not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie I have been thinking today of the visit which you made at our house how sad you must have felt when you saw Laurie and I caressing brother and thought you too had a sister, but her caresses were denied you. If I had then known of your sister nothing in the world would have separated us to express my joy so warmly in your presence. I could not have pursued your noble heart so much as my actions undoubtedly did. But if you were only here would not I supply the place of that absent sister. Will you not tell me more about her. Does she resemble you? She certainly loves you dear one, who could help it. I do wish you could get her to write to you. The thought just presented itself that perhaps this thought would not be agreeable to you and I am now doing just what I would not do for any thing - praising you. If I am darling forgive me. But for fear that I may say something which I ought not so I will change the subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hallis is in Warren yet, he came home last friday and stayed over night but went away in the morning. How I should loved to have had him stay over the sabbath but when I urged him to stay he looked at me with his great black eyes and said "Addie can you ask me to stay when you know that duty calls me away?"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I urged him no more to stay but told him to go. What a power my brother has over his sister. One reproachful look from him will bring the tears to my eyes and such a heavy pain will gather round my heart that will never leave me till I know that I am forgiven for the offense that brought that look. Just such a power I feel and know my Charlie has over me. I can feel it when I read your letters and I know it is with me in every action.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thus it is with this I truly love and the deeper my love is for my and the more strongly do I feel that proven.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But what a letter I am writing you to day. I sat down and let my strengths go just as fast and about as curious as that "about" is. But I guess you will not find time to read this hurried "thing" if I do not cease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do not fail to write often dearest. If, more than two mail days pass with out hearing from you the "Blues" get hold of me most unmercifully and no relief can I find until I receive a letter from you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I guess it is unecessary for me to sign my name to this for it you do not recognize your Adelaide's writing send it back.</field>
