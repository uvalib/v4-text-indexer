      <field name="fulltext">THE resolutions proposed by Mr. Madison, upon the principle of securing the advantages to the navigation and commerce of the United States, which of right belong to her, and which have been hitherto usurped by Britain, have been postponed to the first Monday in March, by which time, the public will may be tolerably ascer- tained , and foreign occurrences better known: A state like ours, whose prosperity depends upon the regular exportation of bulky commodities, to distant countries, must be deeply interested to secure the national means of doing it, independent of foreign revolutions and wars.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The idea of a naval force (heretofore proposed) is yet progressing, attended with an additional tax ; it is unfortunate that the benefits expected from the one, are by no means, so certain as the burthen upon the community, which will inevitably flow from the other, should it succeed.â€”Demands have been made from a French island, for aids of men, ammunition and provisions; but as these do not derive their origin from France itself, it is hardly probable that they will be persisted in, or produc- tive of any degree of embarrassment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The subject of the slave-trade, has been introduced by the Quakers, into Con- gress, and now stands upon the report of a committee, favorable to the object of the petitioners ; this only extends to prevent a practice of some people, who have lately been employed, in transporting slaves from Africa to the West-India islands; and is not levelled in the remotest degree, against the rights of private property.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">It would be improper to conceal an apprehension, to meet which, the public mind ought to be prepared. It is not a secret, that prevarications have been resorted to by the British minister, to avoid a negociation for the fulfilment of the treaty, and that his court have almost peremptorily refused to surrender the western posts upon any event. Time only can develope the real motives of a conduct so unjust.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The late successes of France, against an unexampled combination of despots, will, I hope, clear away the clouds which had begun to darken our political horizon, and secure to us peace, the best pledge for liberty, safety and happiness. Should, howe- ver these precious objects of society be unjustly assailed, contrary to my expectation, that the efforts in their defence may be commensurate to their importance, is the fer- vent hope of</field>
