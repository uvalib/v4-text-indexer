      <field name="fulltext">the several stanzas of a poem, one word or phrase is repeated ; and of alliteration, in whose simplest form a consonant is repeated in the commencements of various words. This effect would be extended so as to embrace repetitions both of vowels and of consonants, in the bodies as well as in the beginnings of words; and, at a later period, would be made to infringe on the province of rhyme, by the introduction of general simi- larity of sound between whole feet occurring in the body of a line: — all of which modifications I have exemplified in the line above,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Farther cultivation would improve also the refrain by relieving its monotone in slightly varying the phrase at each repetition, or (as I have attempted to do in "The Raven" ) in retaining the phrase and varying its application — although this latter point is not strictly a rhythmical effect alone . Finally, poets when fairly wearied with following precedent — following it the more closely the less they perceived it in company with Reason would adventure so far as to indulge in positive rhyme at other points than the ends of lines. First, they would put it in the middle of the line; then at some point where the multiple would be less obvious; then, alarmed at their own audacity, they would undo all their work by cutting these lines in two. And here is the fruitful source of the infinity of "short metre". by which modern poetry, if not distinguished, is at least disgraced. It would require a high degree, indeed, both of cultivation and of courage, on the part of any versifier, to enable him to place his rhymes — and let them remain — at unquestionably their best position, that of unusual and unanticipated intervals.</field>
