      <field name="fulltext">Culpepper Court House. Va. Aug 18th 1862 My darling Addie ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dont you think I keep my promises well? I did not intend to allow twenty four hours to elapse after I wrote that short letter, ere I answered your two letters in full, but Burns has quaintly, yet truthfully said -- The best laid plans of mice and men Gang aft aglee. --</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What with guard duty, reviews, inspections &amp;c. , our time has been completely occupied, ever since we came to this camp.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have been cogitating this morning on vari- ous subjects, but invariably my thoughts revert to Ohio , and it is not difficult for you to con- jecture to what point, so I thought would have a few moments chat with the immediate object of my affections. When I recieved your darling letters just after the battle, my heart was inexpressibly lightened, and I felt more like enduring the hardships which I knew would inevitably ensue, but I confess they were lighter -- or at least they seemed so to me -- than we all expected. But I will not dwell on this.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">While we were at Alexandria , I wrote a letter to your Papa , asking his consent to our union at any time you might specify, and I recieved a reply which made me very happy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">He says “If it is your and Addie 's wish to connect your destinies for life, you shall have my best wishes and approval, unless that I shall learn of some dishonor attached to you, or her.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ought I not to be happy, after recieving a reply like that? Do you wonder, my own, why I took such a course without informing you? I scarcely know myself, unless it was that I might have the pleasure of telling you. my- self, that he not is not opposed to our union</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Have I your pardon, my Queen, for so palpable a wrong? Now that there is no obstacle inter- vening, there remains nothing but for you to denominate a day to consumate our union I know my darling that it was your request that you should make the first allusion to this, but I feel an anxiety to know the time when you will be all mine. But of course there is the uncertainty of the time when I shall come home. Pardon me, Addie mine, if I have made an ill timed allusion, and I will offend no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask my opinion of McClellan and his movements. Really that is a very difficult y question to answer; however, I will give you my mind. Now I have ever loved McClellan with all his strategy and his faults, and it grieves me deeply to learn of the reverses he sustains from time to time. But I feel assured that it is no fault of his. Only look at the disadvantages under which he has labored. He had a magnificent army when he landed at Newport News , and he reduced York- town much quicker than any of his many persecutors could have done it by an assault, and carried up his advantage until he reached the very face and front of the most formidable defences of modern times, and requested reinforcements. These were denied him (until too late. ) and he was forced to assume the defensive having to sustain a front of more than thirty miles, after having to garrison the entire Peninsula which he had conquered, and to face the horrors of disease from the horrible Chickahoming swamps.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At last, despairing of aid, either by direct rein- forcements or cooperation from the Rappahannock by McDowell , he was forced to make that most difficult movement of all -- to change his base by a flank movement in the face of an enemey -- and this at a time when the rebels where strongly reinforced and greatly outnumbered him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Notwithstanding the fact that the enemy were defeated in each of the six days battles, he was forced to hasten on toward the James river , or he would be left as bad as at first: and I say boldly , that those who condemn McClellan for the course purused by him on the Peninsula , are un- qualified enemies to the cause of the Union -- pro- vided, they know the circumstances. I confess that for a time, my faith in him began to waver, but when I closely examined the reord , I felt more confidence than ever. It is my opinion that he intends to join Pope 's army and make a direct attack upon the left flank of Richmond .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My mind in relation to English intervention, is easily expressed. The grain crop in entire Europe is a failure this year, and it is a self evident fact that we must furnish England with bread, and she must learn, with the South , that “Corn (not butter) is king.)” Even that most virulent secession sheet “the Richmond Enquirer ,” despairs of foreign aid. In case England should be so hotheaded as to inter- fere in our civil affairs, she will find that she not only “puts her foot in it,” but gets in all over .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ireland will surely revolt and throw off the iron yoke, and France will improve the chance and inflict the long delayed revenge for their defeat at Waterloo . No! no! Do not fear. England is but too glad to remain across the sea and insult us, but is too cowardly to attack us. I think she will have her hands full to keep Canada under her thumb. I am daily expecting to hear that the long smouldering fires will have broken out, and Canada declared her independence. Let it be so. -- we will have a powerful ally on our own shores, and England will tremble.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">One remark gave me most sincere pleasure. it is this that you have ceased to consider any thing I say as flattery. I have never intentionally used flattery, for two reasons -- 1 st I know you dislike it -- 2 d I detest it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And when I say you are one of the best living girls, I say so from a deep, firm conviction of truth and justice -- nay do not smile, I am a good reader of character, and my estimates seldom fall short.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My darling, I admire your patriotism but I could not say amen to your sacrificing your life, should I fall. Would it not be wrong? You know I enlisted to defend my country -- with my life if needs be, and should I fall, and our country be saved you should live and enjoy the fruit of our -- of my labor. But I have passed through fires unharmed, while my comrades fell around me, and is not that allpowerful God able to still protect me -- while you pray for me ? He will do it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">“Good for you” -- the firmness you display ed in punishing Miss Lizzie will be of immense advantage to you hereafter, as you will find.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Certainly you are a good girl for telling me your experiences, and my own, you must not hesitate to make me your confidant. I will be but too happy to share your trials and assist you in difficulties.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have not yet heard from Hallie . I read in the papers that the regiment was ordered to report at Columbus on the 25 th of this month, but do not know whether they have gone or not.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Where is Dora ? Did my letter offend her? If so, kiss her once for me, and ask her to par- don me, will you not. Speaking of “kisses” reminds me of my dream last night. My bed was very hard and I was your trials and assist you in difficulties.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Where is Dora ? Did my letter offend her? If so, kiss her once for me, and ask her to par- don me, will you not. Speaking of “kisses” reminds me of my dream last night. My bed was very hard and I was quite restless, and I had just sunk into a troubled sleep when I felt a soft hand upon my forehead, I instantly awoke, the room -- it was a pretty chamber -- was light, but no one was to be seen. I hastily attired myself, and the light expired. I then lay down upon my bed and closed my eyes in deep thought. Scarcely had I done so, when I felt that same soft, warm hand, on my forehead. Upon opening my eyes, the light was again burning, but again no one was to be seen. As I peered around in a sort of dreamy wonder I saw a curtain at the opposite end of the room move slightly, and heard an eager though sup- pressed breathing. Advancing, I drew the curtain aside, and entered. -- “I came -- I saw -- I” -- threw my arms around your lovely form, and pressed your ruby lips to mine. -- and I jumped nearly out of the tent, treading on someones toes in the ope- rations. I had turned partly over and hit the tent, and a great big bug fell upon my nose -- but I feel that loving kiss still -- so warm and genial. Wasn't it a funny dream?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. Write very soon, my precious Addie . Give my love to -- yourself, and remem- ber me to Dora . Ever your devoted Charley . Direct Co. K. 7 th Regt. O.V.I. Geary 's Brigade, Army of Virginia. Via Washington D.C.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">I send you a little flower that I picked upon the battlefield while the cannon burned and the shells were bursting. It was a very pretty one -- of a bright pink and blue. It grew upon a creeping vine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you know the name of it? -- Geo. Moore and Little Bob Murray are at Alexandria .</field>
