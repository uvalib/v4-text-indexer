      <field name="fulltext">Oil Spring school, Aug. 10 th 61 Dear friend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will see by this, that I am at Laurie's school, and feeling rather idle &amp; thought I would endeavor to find the where abouts of an almost neglected friend . I say neglected, for the reasons that I have written but once and then directed Camp Dennison. I afterward learned that you left about the time I wrote. If you did not receive that letter you undoubtedly think, Addie does not keep her promise very well. But I will hie away to other and more interesting subjects</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First, how does my friend like military life after undergoing the dangers and privations that must necessarily accompany a true soldier, but no doubt you are sustained greatly by the assurance that you are in a good and righteous cause as you truly are. Do you have any warm weather in Vir. I can assure you that it is warm enough here. How often I voluntarily exclaim how I pity the soldiers this warm weather, although Laurie says, such remarks are only applied to two or three.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The 19 th Regt returned last week. I have had the honor of seeing two of them But I would have felt far more honored I if it had been the noble 7 th thear is one strong tie which binds me to the 7 th and that is Hallie. I have several friends that I feel deeply for their interest, but none equal to my brother I sometimes think. Perhaps I think too much of him, but you must know that it is sometimes impossible to con- trol our feelings. By the bye we recd a letter from Hallie yesterday. he speaks of coming home in the course of six or seven weeks. now can you guess what I am going to request of you? It is this, if you find it convenient will you please come with Lieut Case (Oh, shocking how his name sounds) and finish that “ wee bit ” of a visit that you commenced I am sure Hal. will join me in my request. But one of Laurie's pupils wishes me to solve a problem that has sadly puzzled his wise little head so. “ Right about face ”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thanks. Sister thought she would “ turn out and relieve guard, Are you always as lucky? How is your health. I hope it is good. we know not how to prize good health. You may have sisters but I doubt if they can take a deeper interest in your welfare than I do. It is strange why it is, but one single remark you made while at our home immediately I called forth my deepest sympathy in your behalf. The remark was this. “ My home is not to me what home should be ” that single remark made me look upon you in a different light than before. Pardon me when I tell you that. That remark had a strong influence in my complying with your request to correspond with you, but after reading your letter that feeling was partially destroyed because I concluded that I should enjoy your letters very much. I received your gift the engraving of Camp Dennison for which I was very very thankfull and placed it with my choice treasures You will excuse the abruptness in which this is ended but I have a chance to send it to the office and embrace the opportunity</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours in pure friendship Addie E.C. Please write soon and often Be true to your country and your God</field>
