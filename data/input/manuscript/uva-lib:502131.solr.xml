Shuey, Kate Shields &amp; cousin Josie of course I will expect you to have Mr. Linzy as a water to make the 6th I do not know how to spell the name; Oh how I wish you were here that we could make the arangement you are so slow a bout writing I think you are so careless a bout writing Willie dear will you always be so it has a bad tendency now you can not imagin my feelings when I think a bout it but then I think it will not be long that I will be from you &amp; that you will strive to make me happy. Alas how long long did I await to hear these words the other night Kate I am striving to live a better life to become a good Christian my dear one are you trying to do this Oh I do hope you are you cannot imagine the joy those few words would create within in my bosom I think the tryals that I have dayly would be nothing if I but knew that all that you can do is being done; if I allow myself to think for one moment that you are not doing that I almost shrink from the situation or position I have taken but I feel that you are trying for I know you will not have me brake that no I know you want to make me happy &amp; that will make us both happy dearest remember me in your dayly prayrs but enough.</field>
