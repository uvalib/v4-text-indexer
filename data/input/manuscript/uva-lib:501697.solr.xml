      <field name="fulltext">Staunton Monday Night— Dec the 2 1841 My dear husband</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I fancy you at the Powhatan to night and I hope that instead of one letter you will get two from me, there must be some irregular -ity in the mails. I have never failed to write you twice a week and you ought to have receivd a letter before you left Richmond — for St. Julian — if you get both letters you will acknowledge the recip't of them— oh how delighted I should have been at an unespected visit from you and I could not help feeling disappointed that you thought of coming and did not do so but I think you acted wisely — I know if you had consulted your inclination alone that you would have spent your Christmas with us . You see I am not jealous but I eny Pa his happiness— and hope you had a pleasant trip — I am alone with no other company than John and Juliet— M &amp; V. are at their Grand Pa's I am lonely enough but I was afraid to keep Margaret at home least she should incur then Grand Pa's displeasure , She told him that I would be alone and it seem'd to fret him and I've linquis -hed my claims at once, tho' reluctantly I aſsure you they will be gone all week I expect Juliet tomorrow or the next day I wrote to Father that I should keep him here— Sandy Stuart writes that she was much admired in Washington Staunton is very dull I never knew it as much so as this season— Mr Hamilton was here a few days ago Judge Baldwin examined him and he is now at Judge Smith's will be here tomorrow night— he has concluded to settle in Lexington after a visit to Lynchburg— he has many schemes to numerous to mention in a letter thinks that he can keep house on less than he can board for— which is 300 Dollars — they will beat me in management if they do and hire servants — Mat will not be down this winter——our servants are all hired to the institutions Mary and Ann— we get 40 dolars for it is the best home for them I think I did not consult Ann;— I hold Joe at 120 dollars and expect to get it— he remains at the hospital they can't do without him and must pay for him— John will bring the same — Beverly has not come I expect him this week— Charlotte will be here tomorrow — I never had as little anxiety about hiring the servants— and never did better— Doct. Berkeley has all this on his hands and no homes for them yet— I was there today delivered your message— but he did not say that you should get more things I suppose he will write if he still wants them—my groceries have not arrived yet— I will write as soon as I get them—you would laugh if you could take a peep at my table with two plates and cups on it—me at the head and John at the foot— doing like pa he says he is very attentive to my wants and says if I write you that he is a bad boy he will tane the letters up. he wants to send you some ginger cakes for a Christmaſ gift— Juliet says yet I want to see my Pa —She wont forget you She improves daily I think—they rise every morning before day light and are as merry as crikets — the airtight stove is the greatest comfort to us we manage it better this winter and I could not do without it. Some cold mornings I sit all day in the dining room which is very comfortable the stove burns much less wood than the fire place place did and is much warmer —do write often devote all your leisure moments to me this is asking very little — when you have so few — I think of you all the time. I will write you by Judge Baldwin — Sister Beverly says do send your love to her sometimes I tell her that I cannot share your love with any body — She thinks me very selfish.—</field>
