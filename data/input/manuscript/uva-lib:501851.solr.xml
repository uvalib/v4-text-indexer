      <field name="fulltext">West Point Nov 6 th 1830 Dear sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I would have written you long before but did not know my letters would reach you. I was greatly in hopes you would have come on to W. Point while you were in H. York and was very much discomfited when I heard you had gone on home without letting me hear from you. I have a very excellent standing in my class. in the first section in every thing and have great hopes of doing well. I have spent my time very pleasantly hitherto but the study requisite is incessant, and the discipline ex- ceedingly rigid. I have seen Gen l Scott here since I came, and he was very polite and attentive. I am very much pleased with Colonel Thayer , and indeed with every thing at the institution. If you would be so kind as to send me on a Box of Mathematical Instruments, and a copy of the Cambridge Mathematics, you would confer a great favor upon me and render my situation much more comfortable, or forward to Col. Thayer the means of obtaining them; for as I have no deposit, my more necessary expenditures have run me into debt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Please give my respects to Mrs. A and to Mr and Mrs. Las Galt and Miss V.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Cunningham was also on here some time since, and Mr. I. Chevalie and I was indeed very much in hopes that the beauty of the river would have tempted yourself and Mr. and Mrs. Las Galt to have paid us a visit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours affectionately Edgar A Poe</field>
