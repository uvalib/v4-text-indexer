      <field name="fulltext">At Home Aug 12 th 1866 Dear Brother</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your letter came to hand some two months ago. I was truly glad to hear from you you must for g give me for not answering it sooner as I was very busy at that time. I am now pretty much through my busy. I will give you a sketch of our crop We have a fine crop of tobacco &amp; corn but I think if Providence dont smile on us &amp; give us a little rain, the corn crop will be cut short in this neighborhood. we have not had but one rain in the last two months but I still have some hopes yet Will, we made a fine crop of oats I think we will make about 1500 hundred bushels. Will you said something about being an old grayheaded bachelor if you will come over on this side of the Ridge w h ere love &amp; beauty reign s I think you could find some old widow that would sympathise with you in your troubles, —for I cannot after hear i ng how badly you treated Kate one that you loved so dearly but ala ſ s that love is forgotten. will if you cannot love her again I would not advise you to marry her for it would be unwise to marry any lady without true love—Will said something about the times being better in RockBridge &amp; your substitute for greenbacks I would like to have about 10 gal. of your substitute for it is a very scarce thing in this neighborhood. you say that the wheat was very good in RockBridge I am glad to hear that there is a good crop made somewhare for we have failed in this county. Will you ought to have been with us on the first sadurda y y in Aug we had a grand memorial at the Buckingham female institute there there was about 500, hundred persons there &amp; about two thirds of that number lovely fairsex there wore some of them butiful I could hadley keep from falling in love with some of them. we had some fine spe a ches uncle made one 12 pages long I enjoy ed myself very much. I was over at Scottsville a few days ago I was at uncle Joes I found all well there They told me cousin sweety &amp; Jocy Jane was sick Over the mountain they said that girls you had called on them. When I saw the old Blue Ridge it made me think of home &amp; the happy hours that I have spent there. I would like to come to see you all do not know when I can get an opportunity to do so but I will come as soon as p I can. I think you might come &amp; see us. It is not so far that you should dread the ride trip we could give you some watermellon to eat now.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received a letter from John a few days ago He said all the family was well That was the first letter I have received since I was over I came to the conclusion that they had forgotten how to write it looked very much like it. how is John &amp; Misſs Lightner getting along he did not say anything about it in his letter. Will I will bring my letter to a close as uncle wants to write a few lines. aunt Elysa is with us now She sends her love to you &amp; all the famley me in sending their love to you. nothing more at presant</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Dear Nephew</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As Charles insists on my putting in a few lines I will do so. I wish you would come over to see us. You can find time I reckon and we can give you enough to eat for a short time although our wheat crop was an entire failure. I did not more than I and the quality of that very inferior. Cant you send me over 20 Bushels of No. 1 Medi t teranean at a fair price I think this will hard winters bin. Our other crops are tolerably good, but suffering greatly now for rain. This has been a difficult year. The Spring was cool and the Summer dry. I hope new year will be much better. Charles is a pretty poor farmer but quite lazy He does not visit the Ca much and I think this is the reason. I miss his lazineſs I hope you are getting a start after the war I never experienced such stringent times in my life. I hope next year will be better.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write soon and come over to see us</field>
