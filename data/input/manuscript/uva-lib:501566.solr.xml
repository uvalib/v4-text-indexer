      <field name="fulltext">On board the U.S. Steamer, Silver Lake, Ohio R., Sept 16th 1861 Dear Friend Addie;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">War has its visissitudes as well as the other phases of life and they are not a few I'll assure you. For the past few weeks things have been constantly changing; one day we would be reposing in perceived security and perhaps the next morning be awakened and moved to haste to prepare to meet the meet the enemy who were momentarily expected to come upon us, still except in the instance of Cross Lanes they have not made an open attack upon us. The ? But you will think this is a strange opening for a letter but today it is my "style" Among other changes, ten, includ ing Will B and my self, from Co. H. have been detailed as guards on the Steamer Silver Lake under command of Lieut Wood. (I wish very much that Hal was in his place) We have made these trips from Camp E , 12 miles above Charleston Va. to Gallipolis Ohio and we are now We have on board several of the wounded from the battle ofCarnix's Ford 1 fought last Tuesday, and the remains of Col. Lowe of the 12th O. Regt. who fell at the same battle fighting bravely. Among the wounded are Col. Lytle of the 10th Regt Lieut. Col. Mason of the 13th and Capt McGoverty of the 13th. It is perhaps necessary for me to state that the day was won by our gallent Ohio boys. as you ere this must have received the particulars I had no idea of the feelings produced by being engaged in a battle until the fight at Cross Lanes 2 . These feelings were indescribable. I had no thoughts of dodging the balls nor did I think of getting killed All I did was to take one thought of friends (including you, my dear Addie) then watch for an opportunity to send some "Secesh" to "Kingdom Come" but although we saw them on our front, right, and left, I thought I would reserve my fire till I was sure of my man, or at least till the order was given to fire so lost a chance to discharge my piece</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I cannot speak too highly of Hal. he acted so cooly and bravely; not an action did he commit to lessen the respect and admiration he commands in the entire regiment I would that I could send you his portrait as he stood while we were waiting the approach of the enemy his sword was drawn and his revolver in his left hand ready to face the coming foe. Every oder was given in a manner that showed he meant to be obayed. Suffice it to say that we did merit the apporbrium bestowed upon us by the Cin- cinnati "Gazette" in that they pronounced the affair "Tyler's disgraceful defeat and run "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">We are passing through a most beautiful section of the country. we have now passed Rome, Hanging Rock, Portsmouth, Aberdeen and Higginsport, Ohio and Ashland, Maysville, Rome, Augusta Ky. On the Ohio side the hillsides are covered with vineyards that are now purple with grapes while the Kentucky hills are covered with fields of Corn and Tobacco. We have just met three steamers loaded with a part of " Piatt's Zouave Brigade." We are now just between Foster's Landing Ky. and Nevillsville Ohio. Moscow is in sight. If the Kanawha Valley was more thickly inhabited it would be almost as beautiful as the Ohio and it soon will be for the formation of the State of Kanakha makes it the most important of any section of the state But I must bring this uninteresting letter to a close. Since I received your last letter which I did not get until we arrived at Charleston I have written you a letter covering two and a half sheets did you get it? I have been waiting impatiently for an answer ever since but can get none. I can scarcely get time to write we have so much to do. Standing guard ? . The boat trembles so that I doubt if you can read this rough thing. can you? We just passed Point Pleasant Ohio and New Richmond is in sight we are now twenty miles from Cincinnati. we are running fast and the scenery is splended. Now opposite California Ky. Hall is well or was two or three days ago. I wish he was on here. he would enjoy it so much</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With this I send you a rough pencil sketch of Weston, where Col Tyler took for the government $37000. The view is taken from a hill overlooking the camp. The stream between Camp and town is the West fork of the Monongahela</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must now stop for it is almost time for me to go on guard. Write soon Addie and a good long letter your letters are so good and entertaining. I love them. Give my respects to Laurie and all to whom you see fit and believe me I remain Sincerely and ever yours Charlie Direct to Charleston Kanawha Co. Va. There is New Richmond a beautiful town I wish the boat would stop I would sketch it</field>
