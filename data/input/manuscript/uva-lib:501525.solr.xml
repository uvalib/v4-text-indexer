      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Feb. 19 th 1862. Dearest Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can not refrain from penning you a few lines even if my worthy teacher should censure me for I am now in the schoolroom. So long a time has elapsed since I have received any thing from you that I fear you are ill. Oh! I had such a strange dream last night. I shudder even now when I think of it. You are lying ill and delirious where I could both see and hear you. You calling for me and yet I could not go to you. I struggled long earnestly and in vain, but there seemed some great obstacle between us which I could not surmount. And the more aggravating it was that these, were all whom I had ever had the least feeling of anger toward making me. One thing makes it almost laughable. Col. Tyler was one of them. I awoke completely exhausted and - do not laugh, dearest - weeping. Be assured, my darling, there was no more rest for me. Why bless your dearest. I have not read a letter from you for two weeks, and it is no wonder that such dreams, as the above come to torture me when you, before, have written so often.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Why! I believe the tortures of the rack can be nothing to the imaginnings of such dreams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Has Capt Asper arrived yet? I sent a letter by him or rather, Hallie gave it to him enclosed in it was a portrait of "Your Addie" as you persist in calling her. Oh! I can not drive that ugly dream from my mind. It has given me that detestable desease commonly termed "the blues" and I do not think that there is a thing which will relieve me except a letter from you. Now please write will you not? as soon as you receive this</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling, do you not think "Julius" a beautiful signature? Questions such as this "who is there in Co. H 7th Ohio Reg't by the name of "Julius"? Bless you dearest the same beautiful flow of thoughts: the same dear form of writing, and the same formal manner of writing are visible in "Julius" letters as in "Charlie's". I could distinguished it among a thousand others letters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling how difficult it is to write in a a school room. In imagination picture a school room by fifty scholars ranging in age from the blooming girl of twenty down to the lisping child of four years. Some engaged in studying - perhaps their lessons and perhaps not - some in whispering and others is - sitting still, looking at the next on one side of the room sits our young teacher, before a little boy who is reciting his Geography lesson, in a kind of "dont care" way, and then for the busily writing, as - one of our scholars says, "writing to her beloved of ". Well I don't know as I have any reason to doubt upon it. While such ... as that ... from lips to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Add! Let me see it when you get it finished. I want to learn how to write "Love". "Add I will tell the teacher". you will pardon my poor composition after reading this will you not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hal is well perfectly so, with the exception of his cold. The same feeling seems to pervade Hal that does human beings. That of liking him if friends were always as faithful as is his cold I presume he could have more than he now does. But he has enough. Our sleighing has all gone and left us. It lasted four days. I can assure you that was well improved . There is to be a donation for our pastor, Mr. Arnold, this evening. I shall not attend if I do not feel more cheerful than at the present hour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh, what a buzzing zing there is around me it sounds more like a swarm of bees than like human beings. How do you get along for reading, do you have enough? If not write me and let me know and I will send you some by . Hal and Laurie went to Bristol last week to see Charlie Brooks , and Mr Miller . He thinks Mr Miller will not live long. Charles Brooks starts soon for his Co. . If I can I will send some papers, and books by him. What a victory our troops won at Fort Donaldson [1] . How have the particulins have gone not; and still at what a cost. We lost heavily. And yet we must expect it How barbarous it does seem to fight as they died, yet it is necessary. People say they can read of such battles now with out a shudder, but I can scarcely believe it. Think of hundreds (I move to first page) [2]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">of souls entering the dread within a few short hours, and hundreds of others lying wounded and writhing in their gone . Oh, it is horrible to think of say nothing of the sight. Dear Charlie this question involuntarily rises to my lips. And they preferred to die! What an important and fearful question, and yet how little is thought of it, My darling I do not profess to be a christian, and yet I know there is such a thing as religion. There is something in true religion which I would give worlds to possess, but I do not I have no hesitancy in saying that I do not believe that one half who profess to love their Savior know any thing about it. And yet I know there is a God who is there that can look on this beautiful world and doubt it. Everything declares it I do not think Religion consists in putting on long faces and looking as if the world were coming to an end if we laugh where I do not think Christ intended we should give up all pleasure here for him. But what a strain of thought I have been [3]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">let into It is almost noon and I must close "Remember me for all of the boys and write soon very very soon will you not dearest? Please do not keep Addie in suspense. [4]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours, now, and forever Addie [5]</field>
