      <field name="fulltext">Farmington Dec 17 th 1862 My own dear precious Charlie,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Much has transpired since last I wrote you - one week ago today, both in Virginia Tennessee and perhaps in Ohio . We have the accounts of the fight at Fredericksburg 1 , and of the almost certain destruction of that city, and is it any wonder that I am thank- ful Charlie is not an actor there among the scenes of strife and blood. But how many are there engaged. They may not all be Charlies , but they are probably somebody's father husband, friend or brother, fighting desperately for Union and Liberty, and how many torn and bleeding hearts will there be when the names of those who have fallen a sacrifice to foul, wicked treason are recorded. Yet I have no proof that you are not there. All I know is your allusion to the probability of the 1 st Brigade remaining at in Harpers Ferry during the winter, and that you were (there) in the Pro. Marshall's office. But then your last letter was written long ago - nov. 25 th and many changes may have taken place with the 7 th Ohio, and - with my darling, since then. I am truly sorry that you are in a position where you can not write oftener to your Addie for it is a source of great anxiety to me that I do not oftener hear from you, but I have so often told you this that it is useless repeating it.</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, Evening of 17 December 1862</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Good evening Darling</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was obliged to cease writing this afternoon on account of a recitation coming at 2.30p.m. and another at 3.15 p.m., but school has closed for today, tea has been served, and now I am ready to resume my writing. Winter has made his appearence in force, and now the snow lies upon the ground about four or five inches deep, but as the ground did not freeze solid there is no sleighing. I should enjoy a good sleighride very much, but with no one but thee darling . Oh well; the time may come when we can enjoy life, God grant it may as I have not heard from you lately I know no more about your coming home, Oh Charlie , dear darling loved one could I but for one hour enjoy your society, I would be happy. Can you obtain a discharge? Please write and tell me for this standing between hope and fear is too tantal- -izing. At times I am elated with hope and at other times find myself bordering on despond- -ency. But these thoughts will only tend to sadden you, so forgive me darling.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you hear that? No, well it is the bell, telling us that it is six o'clock; the hour when students must be in their rooms. Thank fortune it does not tell us that we must not write to friends after six. Do you not wish you was a student Oh, it is sport, this going to school. Would you like to know the several rules of our school? I will tell you first we must arise at six (although we must retire ere we can arise yet as this is the first act we perform in the morning, I thought I would give it first) 2 nd studying an hour before Roll-call, 3 rd Being present at roll-call and morning prayers, 4 th not whispering during recitation, 5 th making no unnec- essary noise about the seminary 6 th Being present at all of our recita- tions.</field>
