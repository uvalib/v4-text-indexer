      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Dec. 26 th 1861 My dear friend,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thanks for your kind and welcome letters which have but lately recd. I am surprised that you have not heard from me for so long a time. I have written, I may say, weekly I do not doubt but that some letters are at Charleston I have not written but one since I heard that you had left Charleston owing to the fact that I did not know your address But away to other subjects. I have just been to tea, wished very much that you had been here to partake.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie I have just returned from Mr. Hegless. Sadie Hegless wished me to go to Lyceum with her to night . I will now try to finish this uninteresting sheet. Dear Charlie I cannot concentrate my thoughts to night and you may think this a rather unceremonious letter but I imagined that you would be anxious to hear from me and that I would strive to write</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How shall I thank you, dear brother for your kindness in sending that sketch. Rembember that your gifts are treasured and I trust that the day may come when you may see them again. Our Lodge is slowly prospering, or is I suppose it is. I have not attended it for two months I guess I should enjoy it very much — but I am so far away from it that I can not get there. I find in the colums of the news papers that Gen. Kelly's command is marching towards Winchester . I suppose you are under his command</field>
      <field name="fulltext">May our blessed Father protect thee from all danger. Nothing else can protect you my brother. I wrote a very painful (to me) letter to you and sent it to Warren for Capt. Wood to take to you. I have some strange thoughts dear Charlie at times. Laurie sits here. she say put down “and, thi go back C ther she did that</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie , how often I have regretted that I would not lay my life on the alter of my country but fate decrees otherwise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did I hear you say “How do you like your school? Oh, real well I shall go to Oberlin in February if nothing prevents then I shall be in my elements.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hal's letter that he wrote under the straw stack, I had the gratification to read this morning. I do hope that this cruel war will soon close and restore our much loved friends to our aching hearts. Laurie says send a bushel of     done up in Cris kringle's hat. I guess I will have to wish you Merry Christmas, it may be rather late. Laurie won't let me rest till I ask you if you got intoxicated when you left C    Hal wrote in his letter to the Democrat that a great many were intoxicated at that time. I presume you will be obliged to answer it for her sake</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 Last week I received two letters from you and one yesterday I would that I could hear as often every week</field>
      <field name="fulltext">2 Please excuse all mistakes and poor writing for I am in great haste as it is late</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 Write soon and often to your sister Addie</field>
