      <field name="fulltext">Camp 7th Iowa (Near East Point Ga ) Sept 9th 64 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is some time since I wrote but I have not yet received any answer to my last letter I should have wrote before but we couldnt send away any mail &amp; I was waiting for the taking of Atlanta I still continue to have the best of health &amp; hope that you may be all well I have passed safely through this campaign for I suppose it is through now as we have been down 10 miles below Janesboro &amp; have come back &amp; taken our camp hero 6 miles from Atlanta You will see from the papers the splendid movement of Gen Sherman by which he so completely bamboosled the rebs out of their stronghold cut their communica tion&gt; &amp; compelled them instead of their burying the yankee army here as they boasted as they intende to do to evacuate the town &amp; make the best of their way southward The whole 16th corps worked on the Montgomery road for one day quiet faithful the 7th Iowa had a fine time destroying that road out to Fairburn , 18 miles fron Atlanta . It was the first days work that I ever did on the railway &amp; I liked it first rate. In the morning we went out without knapsacks almost on the doublequick for 8 or 9 miles to the town where we went to work, and then went back at night. Next day, the 2nd, 7th Iowa was ordered to report to Kilpatrick to go with the cavalry as a support We did, and started out with them when about noon we run into some of the Johnnys. We captured a negro that escaped from them &amp; he said there were 1600 of them. They had a rail bar ricade in a large cornfield We fired a few shots with the 10 lb. Rodmans belonging to the cavalry, when the 2nd Iowa which was in advance, immediately formed &amp; charged with a yell up to the barricade &amp; took it, the rebs flying like the wind, the 7th about 40 rods behind as a support. The 2nd lost a number of men but I never knew how many.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the afternoon we joined the rest of ours and the 15th Corps which came in on another road, Then came the battle on the 31st when the rebels got so awfully flaxed old Hood butting his brains out again upon our works. Hardees Corps coming again in front of the 16th which has whipped them 3 times now There was over 44 deserters came in right in front of our regiment, or not exactly deserters but men that in charging across a field got into a ditch &amp; did not retreat back with their comrades. Now all the soldiers want is to have Old Abe for our next president &amp; this thing will soon come to a successful end but if the copperheads elect McClellan or Freemont there will be direful consequences I am afraid. If we get 500,000 more men the rebels can be swept from the face of the earth anyhow before the end of Lincoln 's Administration &amp; I think that it will be done. Sherman has done his work well. I hope that Grant yet accomplish his object take burg &amp; Richmond &amp; we get Mobile A. J. Smith clean out Mississippi and Alabama get our communication open from the gulf, &amp; the rebellion is then played out, which I hope to God it may for this thing has been going on long enough. The report is here that we are going to camp for a month &amp; prepare for a vigorous winter campaign.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As ever Affectionately Charles Berry Senior Now I want you to write soon and often for I don't know how soon we may have to go on another campaign.</field>
