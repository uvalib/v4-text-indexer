      <field name="fulltext">we were on picket about two in the morning we suppose the object of the picket was to stop straglers for the tenth Regt. came across upon the same road consequently the enemy could not leave unexpected. We left Rude's Hill the 11 th &amp; camped near the Spring. Abe, Hunter, John &amp; I stope allnight at Ants She was very much distressed at the thought of the advance of the enemy the people in general were rioting about in the utmost confusion not knowing their personal fate if they stayed nor the fate of their property if they left. Unkle Cirus sold some cattle in town &amp; on his return, he &amp; his three sons met the Brigade they had their horses &amp; equipments expecting to join their company at Richmond they certainly had but little time to escape for the enemy's calvery were at the Spring the next morning. Ashby killed several in Mr. Lincon's wheat-field it is sayed Cousin John &amp; Albert took dinner at home the next day. They say the enemy did not disturb any citizen but took several horses.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Brigade was strongly aversed to leaving the leaving the valley out of the fifth Reg. about 170 men deserted. Three or Four of our company.</field>

It was rumored in camp that the enemy was in Staunton a fiew days ago but that was falce for General Jackson from Alegany was at head quarters and reported that he was holding his position.</field>
