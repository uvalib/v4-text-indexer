      <field name="fulltext">Dear Miss Smith-</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thank you very much for sending me the papers about the fire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The news here was very meagre &amp; until the Charlottesville papers came I really knew nothing except that it had occurred.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is almost impossible to realize that the Rotunda is no more and the Lawn without it must resemble nothing so much as a body without its head. I have not seen the Wilsons since it happened but will go there very soon to talk it over with them.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can only hope that this will be the opportunity to the graduates to show their interest in the old place &amp; that it will soon be restored — The trouble lies in the relics, the pictures etc etc that were burned — These can never be replaced &amp; the Rotunda itself can never be quite the same — There can be but one original —</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I know we both feel the same in these matters &amp; there is no use in discussing it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I should like to move on to New York next week— After Yale's fine showing yesterday I feel quite confident the team will give a good account of themselves against Princeton next Saturday. But tho' I cannot be there, I shall have the next best means of learning the result. We are to have a special wire at the University Club &amp; each play will be reported as it occurs. Of course I wish the University the best of luck in their big game. I was anxious for them to score on U. of P. but they seemed unequal to it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was sorry to hear that Mrs. Robinson was not very well. I trust "her Grace" has fully recovered &amp; please remind her that she owes me a letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I presume that Miss Harrison had fully recovered from her bicycle accident when she was with you. When I saw her in New York before I sailed she was hobbling on a crutch — We ride a great deal here &amp; in this glorious Autumn weather it is great fun. For the past two weeks we have been having some fine artistic &amp; musical treats here in the opening of the Carnegie Library. Damrosch, Melba &amp; other stars. I wish you could be here to enjoy it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Give my regards to all my friends &amp; hoping to hear again when you can manage it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As ever sincerely Starling W. Childs</field>
