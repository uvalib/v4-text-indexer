      <field name="heading_text">Lydia Maria Child. The Rebel Faulkner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">This gentleman is now a prisoner at Fort Warren; having taken up arms against the U.S. for the purpose of establishing a government avowedly based on S lavery, and for the sake of with the explicit avowal that Slavery shall be introduced and sustained all over the continent. To judge how he has fallen, it is only necessary to read his own description of the baneful effects of S lavery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">In the winter of 1831-2, Mr. Faulkner said, in the L egisla- -ture of Virginia: "Sir, I am gratified to perceive that no gentle- -man has yet risen in this H all the avowed advocate of S lavery. The day has gone by, when such a voice could be listened to with patience, or even with forbearance. I even regret, sir, that we should find one among us who enters the lists as its apologist , except on the ground of uncontrollable necessity. If there be one who concurs with the gentleman from Brunswick [Mr. Gholson] in the harmless character of this institution, let me request him to compare the condition of the slaveholding portion of this C ommonwealth, barren, desolate, and seared, as it were, by the avenging hand of H eaven, with the descriptions which we have of this same country from those who first broke its virgin soil. To what is this change ascribable? It is to be ascribed alone to the withering and blasting effects of S lavery.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If this does not satisfy him, let me request him to extend his travels to the N orthern S tates of this U nion. Let me beg him to contrast the happiness and contentment which pre- -vail throughout the country, the busy and cheerful sounds of industry, the rapid growth of their population, their means and institutions of education, their skill and proficiency in the useful arts, their enterprise and public spirit, the monuments of their commercial and manufacturing industry, and above all their devoted attachment to the government, from which they derive protection, with the division, discontent, indolence, and poverty of the S outhern country. To what, sir, is all this ascribable? To that vice in the organization of society, by which one half of its inhabitants are arrayed in interest and feeling against the other half; to that unfortunate state of (turnover) society in which freemen regard labor as disgraceful, and slaves shrink from it as a burden tyrannically imposed upon them; to that condition of things in which half a million of your population can feel no sympathy with the society in the prosperity of which they are forbidden to participate, and no attachment to a government at whose hands they receive nothing but injustice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If the curious, incredulous inquirer should suggest that this contrast, which is so manifest, might be traced to a difference of climate, or to other causes, distinct from S lavery, permit me to refer him to the two S tates of Kentucky and Ohio. There is no difference of soil, no diversity of climate, no diversity in the original settlement of those two S tates, to account for the remarkable disproportion in their advancement. Separated by a river alone, they seem to have been purposely and providentially designed to exhibit, in their future, histories, the difference which necessarily results between a country free from S lavery and a country afflicted with the curse of S lavery. The same may be said of the two States of Missouri and Illinois.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Slavery is an institution which presses heavily against the best interests of the S tate. It banishes free labor, it exterminates the mechanic, the artisan, and the manufacturer. It converts the energy of a community into indolence, its power into imbecility, its efficiency into weakness. Sir, being thus injurious, have we not a right to demand its extermination? Shall society suffer, that the slaveholder may continue to gather his vigintial crop of human flesh? What is his mere pecuniary claim, compared with the great interests of the common weal? Must the country languish and die, that the slaveholder may flourish? Shall all interests be subservient to one? Must all rights be subordinate to those of the slaveholder? Has not the mechanic rights? Have not the middle classes rightsâ€” rights which are incompatible with the existence of S lavery?"</field>
