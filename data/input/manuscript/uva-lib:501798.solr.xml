      <field name="fulltext">New York, April 23d, 1844. Dear Friend,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It would be uninteresting to recount the manifold little hindrances, which have delayed my an- -swer to your refreshing and most welcome letter. Suffice it to say, that it has not been because I do not always carry the memory of you in my heart. You are one of the few whom I want to go into heaven with, and stay near forever. Your letter exhilerated me like a shower-bath. It made me feel more cheerful and strong for weeks after. I am glad my letter about Ole Bulbul found such an echo in your soul. It is a proof to me that I struck a chord in the "everlasting chime". If I did say "the very best thing that was ever said about music", it must have been Ole Bulbul's violin that told it to me. You, unfortunately, know so much, that this Shakespeare of the violin may not delight you as he did me. I have known nothing like it, in my ex- -perience of pleasure. Perhaps none but the ignorant could feel such a rush of uncriticising, overwhelming joy. Connoisseurs give the palm to Vieux Temps; but I persist in my belief that France made him , and Mr. Child is still at Washington, or he would send a heart full of kind remembrance. God made Ole Bull. I have certain theories about the nations, which makes it difficult for me to believe that France ever goes very deeply into the heart of things, though her mechanism of all the external of man and of society is most perfect. The application of this theory may, of course, be very unjust to individuals. Shall I confess my weakness ? I am not quite willing to be con- -vinced that the genius of the French minstrel equals that of the Norwegian. I can not explain exactly why; except that my imagination has anointed and crowned Ole Bull king of the realms of sound, and is willing to admit no rival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So long as I am presumptuous enough to give any opinion at all about music, I will, with becoming diffidence, just whisper in your ear, certain feelings (I can not call them thoughts ) which I had while listening to the opera of Il Puritani. I was continually troubled with the in- -congruity between the subject and the music . The drama came in obtrusively between me and the spirit of the composer. It plagued me, and I wanted it out of the way. To me the music spoke of the struggles and aspirations of a human soul. Its first youthful adoration of Nature, going up in worshipful chorus, like birds saluting the morning; the restless seeking after its other half, in wild sweet strains through shady groves; its fluttering love, its pleading earnestness, its undefined fears, its sudden joys, its passionate clinging to the sweet ideal — the tearing asunder — the deep sorrow — the agonized supplication — and at last, the triumphant joy! the dawning of a better life!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">What has Cromwell's army to do with this? I shut my eyes to get rid of the incongruity, but I could not; it would come between my soul and Bellini. It may seem presumptuous for me to say so; but I don't believe it had any business there; any more than the sulphur-breathing dragon of Calvinism would have in a world of beauty and order. Will you tell me what you think of this?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am very much obliged to you for your address on association. On this subject, I have strong faith in principles , and a troublesome distrust of men. If I could find a hand as clear-sighted, yet as mystical, as reverential, yet as democratic, as ideal, yet as actual, as Parke Godwin, I should be drawn into a phalanx by irresistable attraction; as it is , I am in some danger; but experience bids me be very cautious, to avoid the blinding excitement of conventions and meetings, and examine the subject in stillness. I have seldom held communion with a mind, which kindled my own, like Parke Godwin's. He is one of those minds which draw their lines from a centre; and however widely he may diverge, one knows where to expect the return of the curve. This not the case with William Channing. He goes off into infinite space, and is lost among rainbows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I was sorry I did not see Mr. Ripley when he was here. I was obliged to be absent most of the time on Long Island, establishing Friend Hopper's youngest daughter in school, or I should have sought him out. I feel a most affectionate respect for him, and great sympathy with his advance- -guard in the settlement of social freedom. Remember me most respectfully to Mrs. Ripley, and most kindly to Mr. Dana.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My adopted son, John Hopper, desires a most cordial remem- -brance to you. He fell in love with you at sight, and never speaks of you without great satisfaction.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Farewell. Your affectionate friend, L.M.Child.</field>
