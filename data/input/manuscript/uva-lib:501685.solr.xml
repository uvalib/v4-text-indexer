      <field name="fulltext">Zephir Hill Aug 13 1866 Dear Brother,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your welcome letter reached me not long since and not to delay any I will answer it immediately Excuses being always plentiful I will not let any definite one arise Be negligence no one for not writing sooner. Pray do not think I have forgotten you. If there is any such feeling lurking in heart, banish every such feeling for I know you cannot have such an evil spirit against one who has ever loved you. Truly I have not been at home much in three months I spent two month in Marion I was pefectly enamored with that place I must acknowledg that I enjoyed my visit there splen- didly After the excitement of examinations subsided the town became comparatively dull for a season but all were willing to abide that monotony to enjoy a little rest. No doubt all appreciated repose. Some of the exibitions were very entertaining Griffin young Ladies bade adieu to the halls of learning to begin their careers in the worlds broad field of battle The thoughts of that place have recently had two tournaments and contemplate having still another. They are becoming so common I have lost all interest in them I wish you could have seen one of the nights representing Don Quixote accompanied by his page Pancho Panza and encased in complete armor Really he was one of the most hideous being ever was ever was seen During my visit I attended a large Sunday school Picnic. The place designated for the picnic was Poplar's spring about five miles from Marion. The roads being good we arrived at the springs about 8 o clock Four or five hours passed gayly by and about 1 or 2 o clock dinner was announced and such a display of luxuries were spread out before us as might satisfy the palate of the most fastidious epicure We paid our respects to these dainties pretty generally and after two or three hours of unallayed pleasure we took up our line of march for home. We expect to have a picnic in our neighborhood this week. Do No doubt we will have a gay time I being necessitated to teach, at present is devoting my leisure hour hours exclusively to study, prepar- ing to entering upon what avocation when I think proper.I am compelled to get married or teach and and between the two evils I prefer teaching yet a while. The man that I marry will have be something superior to the common herd of mankind. He will have to be such if he can ever win my affections for my heart is now dead to every emotion of love. I hope you will pay me visit this fall. I would be so glad to see you. The crops are very good in the lane brake , but not elsewhere I send you my photograph and hope you will send yours in return. Don't get frighten ed at it Excuse my paper and pencil</field>
