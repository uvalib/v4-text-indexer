      <field name="fulltext">Farmington 15, Jan. 1863. My own precious darling,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have just returned from "Ball Call" and seated myself in the comfortable room with pen in hand to pour out on paper thoughts for your eyes alone, which shall again remind you of my strong devotion for my own loved one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved the letter from Welfare Goon and Barnum, last evening. Nothing could have give one greater pain that to know that you dearest; had suffered a relapse. Your last letter was so hopeful and charming that I was much encouraged, but as you my dearest; "There is many a livest? the and the life." May God in his great mercy give you strength so that you may not again be brought to your bed. I think there was nothing which kept me from utter dispair, except the knowledge that you had recieved a furlough and that God illing, you will soon be home. But love, will not the exertion be too great? Will not the journey be too long for you to undertake in your weak state?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Oh Charlie, darling one I tremble. Would that you were but here, But I will be hopeful and trust in God's goodness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Seth informed me that the arrival of any letters gave you great pleasure, I was gratified to know it; I feared they were written with so much that they would but thend to make you worse, But darling, do not read my sad thoughts, read only the happy ones, or at-least do not dwell upon the sad ones. I will try and write cheerful loving letters, just such as you dear Charlie needs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">How happy I should be love, could I but watch over you as you return to health, I do not believe any one can do as well I as I should. How devoted I should be. When the pain tortured you, I would try and so drive it away and soothe you with gentle words, such as none but your Addie has a right to utter. Then when you were able and could endure it, I would read some splendid work, from which we could obtain instruction, and for one . Would be not be happy dearest? In my dreams I was with you last night. I went to sleep wishing that I could fly to you. I had no sooner fallen into a gentle slumber than I was lifted from my bed and far far away, over mountains, hills, rivers, citites and towns, on on till at last I found myself in a dark comfortable foom surrounded by . Some were lying on rough beds, others walking around as if tired of life and wished to walk into eternity, I was told that I was in a hospital and that those frightful objects were dear brave soldiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mentally, I asked if Charlie was there and began searching. Earnestly I gazed in each face hoping to see one familiar glance one loving one, I looked in one corner and noticed a rude couch of straw accompanied by my Charlie / I needed no second glance to convince me, besides over it born, his face animated and his blue-eyes humming with joy as he asked, "How you ." I flew to thee darling and awaken Carrie. But darling Carrie wishes to a word of enocouragement; and this with hers will be all that you must read at one time. I will write a line to who so to me for you, and if you are proper please give it them. Darling even to have you with me I remain as ever thine own true,</field>
