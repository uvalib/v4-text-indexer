      <field name="fulltext">Yours as ever Kate Come back, Oh Come! The past shall be A cloud for ere removed; Come back and in my welcome see How thou art still beloved. I strove in vain to bid my heart Forget its early dream; For ah! the dream would not depart, And thou wert still its theme. Come back, and never more shall doubt Or cold distract be mine; My hear has cast those demons out, And now is wholy thine.</field>
