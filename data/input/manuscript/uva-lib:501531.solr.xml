      <field name="fulltext">Heaven reward you and bless you, my own my dear darling Charlie for your kind and precious letter of the 25 th inst. . Darling, you do not know how much it relieved my heart. of an almost sinking fear and pain. Although it relieved me of my worst fears, yet it brought painful information that you did not escape unharmed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dearest, I know that you was injured far worse than you represented yourself to be. Do you not think that I could see in the very tone of your letter that it was with extrem pain that you could trace those dear lines? Oh, dear Charlie, please tell me just how badly your arm was hurt.. Darling, why should you attempt to conceal from me your sufferings. Who should sooner know of your sufferings than one who has plighted her love, aye, even her life if necessary to you I could not feel worse.dearest to know the entire truth than I now do. What. my Charlie trying to conceal from me - the one who should be with him through the hours of pain the extent of his wounds! Oh, do not my darling. The very thought is but frenzy. Why is it that I can not be with you. God only knows what I have suffered since I heard of that fearful battle.. I had not heard from you for some tim before that and when I read of the fight. and still no word from Charlie. then and only till then did I realize what life would be worth to me without you. I said to Laurie last sabbath. “What does it mean. three weeks ago tomorrow since I have heard from Charlie”? She replied “Have hope Addie. Do not give up in dispair for oh, that is a hard word when forced upon you.” Darling do you wonder that my faith in the protection of an All wise Father was beginning to totter?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sympathize with you in the loss of your comrade. Fred. lo__ and also with the wounded. Arthur Cavanah. I have seen several times. He formerly kept the “Livery Stable” at Powers corners. did he not? What a sickening sight a battle field must be. The discription of it which you gave me is enough. I never wish to see one.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Darling. how would you like it if I should teach school this summer. There is a school in Claridon that is not engaged. and they wish very much to have me teach it. Should I dear. They wish for a six months school rather long but nevertheless it will do. I do so dread this inactive, monotonous life I am now leading. besides I have no desire to live at home this summer. but I will be guided by your decision. The school is in Miss Leslie's district.. How I should love to have you come home darling. If I teach I wish very much to have you come before I commence my school. can you come? If you were but with me now. Oh, my darling. I am fearful that your wound is much more than you . yourself think. but I must hope for the best. Is not this day. beautiful? Oh the world is full of beauty when the heart is full of love.is it not. Charlie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The twenty ninth Ohio Regt . was engaged in that fight were they not? Are you acquainted with Edwin Williams of that Regt. he is a brother of mine in the Templars curse . Ed. and Will. Braden are or were firm friends . when here in Mecca, He formerly belonged to the Seventh Ohio I think. But I have not time to write longer as papa is going over to the office tonight and I must send this while I have a chance these muddy roads! Remember me to the boys. and darling. be careful of your health. Do not get cold in your arm</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write often very often to cheer the heart of your Addie</field>
