      <field name="fulltext">East Claridon June 4 th 1862 My own loved Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Did you ever see a more disagree- -able morning than this? Rain, rain nothing but rain and has been so for nearly a week. Don't you pity the school teachers such a day as this? Here have I walked nearly half a mile through the rain and much before eight o'clock, and after building a fire to make it appear more cheerful have gone to writing. But what are my inconveniences when compared with the soldiers. Here I find a dry and pleasant school-room to enter and although they are not now here, there soon will be happy faces hurrying to receive their teachers morning kiss. and then follows the pleasant hours to be spent in learning and reciting lessons. While with the soldier, how different. Perhaps for their employment is a long and tedious march through the storm with no covering, to be welcomed only with a cry of revenge and maybe death. Really my labors are but light. and how much nobler is the cause in which they are engaged than is mine. But you will be anxious to hear how my school is prospering. I think it "goes of" finely. Not quite as well as I could wish (for you know we are prone to wish more than can be expected sometimes) but full as well and perhaps better than I expected. Thirty scholars attend now. they are from four to seventeen years of age. Have I ever told you the branches that are studied? They are reading writing. Arithme -tic . parts 2 nd and 3 rd Ray's. Mitchells Geography , Pin n eo's Grammar , and Ray's Algebra 1 . also Orthography. Now do you not think I have a school ? I do. There. I told you they would come. one. two three four five - all coming to say good morning. and the girls to receive the kiss which I had to stop writing long enough to give them. I would that you could see them, darling, one little boy wishes me to stop writing and talk to him, shall I do it? I know you would say yes, dear Charlie. were you here so I will gratify him</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Noon,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Were you here dearest, I would want more time to talk with you and also have it more connected than it necessarily must be. For you know a teacher must write when they she can. Charlie do you remem ber the " Missing Bride " that you was reading while home on furlough? and do you remember represented there as Jaqualina? (Is that spelled right?) I asked you. because if you do you are acquainted with one of my scholars, only she is awful. "spunky" Her actions are so like Jacka's. You ought to see her eyes. I never saw such black eyes in my life. and how she will look. I often am obliged to turn my face from her to avoid laughing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlie, dear, what do you think of the retreat of Gen. Banks . Are you not angry that the rebels again occupy Winchester ? I should think your right arm would rise up in indignation, or some- thing worse. Many here think it a strategetial movement. That the Union soldiers intended surrou -nding and capturing what they can. but people will speculate upon the movements if the army; whether they know the truth or not. Also what do you think of the evacuation of Corinth . If the rebels were so strongly fortified as the pretended to be and had such a large force, why did they leave it? Where is their boasted courage! There army so devoted to their trait- orous institution! Gone after the Merimac 2 , perhaps? How excited are the northern loyalists in regard to the call for more volunteers. Boys, no more than 14 or 15 years of age require the utmost exertion of their parents and friends to prevent them from leaving all and join the army. Old men that are bending with age and have now one foot on eternity as we might say listen to the hard fought battles with a desirething eye and wish they were young again for nothing but to serve our country. Oh, Charlie such scenes do my heart good. Although there I would shrink from the sight of suffering. and always have. yet there are insults for which nothing but blood can atone. Such an insult has the Southerners given to the north. Had the north and south understood each other, never would this civil war here been. but you have enough of this in your own camp I presume and as it is nearly time to commence school I must close. Shall I ask you to excuse this poor letter? I have written in a great hurry besides having the scholars playing all round one I presume I look "sweet" now for the scholars have wreathed my hair with flowers. one little girl said she wanted it to look like my face. Little flatterer is'nt she.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must say my good by and accompanied with it are the blessings of Addie My regards to the Boys if you please Oh! I forgot to tell you that Laura was up to see me last week and Hal has gone to the army again he has gone to Columbus with a company that he organized in Warren . Darling boy, he did not come up to see me nor did I know that he had gone till I saw in the " Leader " 3 that Capt. Case went through there last friday enroute for C with his co.</field>
