      <field name="fulltext">May 27 th '62 . Noon, My darling Charlie .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I can not wait till night before answering your darling letters. therefore will write a little this noon, although I am so happy that I can hardly contain my self. Yes darling you have entered manhood. and I trust a bright and happy future is before us . Many thoughts I cast toward Charlie on the 8 th of May " Loving thoughts darling. I have a stronger claim on you now. have I not. for now you are truly a man. But what have you ever been to me but a true noble minded man. Yes darling you are right. Many many sighs and wishes "that Charley was here" has been wasted not only on the morning breeze but evening breeze, Charlie I must relate a little incident that occured last friday eve. The soldiers "Mite Society" of Claridon met at Mr. Armstrongs, and I went becoming tired of the noise and gossip in the house I rose and quickly went out of the room into Mr. Leslie's intending to seek Dora. She had gone out. and I went out in the cooling night air to refresh myself. I passed on a few rods from the house and strew myself down under an apple tree with the exclamation "I wish Charlie was here" Imme- diately this answer came from behind me. "And what if Charlie were here," I sprang up with a cry of surprise (not mingled with fear) for I did not know but Charlie had really come. Upon looking round I saw a tall form standing there as quietly as you please. I know not what prompted me but I turned and flew into the house. Soon the gentleman came in (I knew it was the one although I had not seen his face) and was introduced as Mr Richardson, Upon being introduced to me he spoke, and said. "Miss Case you did not wait for Charlie to come." ,, "No. nor will I wait now" I replied and arose, deeply mortified and almost angry at the mans insolence and left the room, I did not again enter the room, until Dora came after me and would not return without me, Mr. R-- did not not notice me again during the evening. for which I was thankful,,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But it is time to close school dearest and for three hours. Addie must bid you good bye.,,</field>
      <field name="heading_text">Letter from Adelaide E. Case to Charles N. Tenney, After School May 27 th , 1862</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After school. My darling. "</field>
      <field name="fulltext">school has closed and I have again read over your letters of the 9 th &amp; 11 th Charlie, yours is a noble spirit. just such as one as I would wish you to have. You have suffured , dear, I know you have, yet with me I would have you call on God to bless your friends. Friends by blood, if nothing more, But darling I know these words will but pain you therefore will change the subject. How aspirant you are dearest. I too feel that you will win laurels. Laurels that any one would be forward to wear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You ask do I ever get tired, and wish those children would be quiet? Yes I often get tired, but as a general thing my scholars are quite orderly. In fact as much so as I could expect. I have two more scholars this week and I can see they have been to "my school" You also ask if I have punished any yet. I have one scholar. John. Halderman. I accidentally heard him swearing one day and called him in. and told him he could remain with me after school.,, He seem- ed pleased at the "news" as he called it; and remained after the scholars had left. I went to my desk, tooke out my Beibl turned to the 20 th Chap. of Exodus 7 th verse and asked him to read it to me. He did so and burst into tears. "Teacher," said he "I have always been flogged for swearing but it never hurt me so bad as this punishment I will swear no more this summer," Charlie I was not ashamed of the tears that fell and mingled with his. He afterward told me that he expected I would try to whip him and he did not intend to let me. He is fourteen years of age, I think. I have not a better scholar in school than he has since been. Dont you admire my government? How very kind Mr s Ostorm was to you darling. I shall ever bless her for that act. Hers, must be a noble heart, and her son too, is he as good as his mother?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You noticed my request in regard to your portrait and ask me what size I wish. I am not particular any size to suit yourself I want a perfect one just as me. I quickly recognized our native "blue belles" and "Violets" but they were never the less thankfully received because the were like our own loved flowers, for did not Charlie send them to me, and are they not a lovely token of the love he bo**s me?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have just read over the letter I wrote you yesterday. and this morning. and have some scruples about sending it. I do not know what caused me to write as I did but my brain was sadly perplexed and I wrote the thoughts that came from my heart. Just so I should have felt all day had I not recieved your letters this morning; But darling I must go or I shall lose my supper.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Write real often darling to your own - Addie I may just as well send Dora's love for she would were she here Addie</field>
