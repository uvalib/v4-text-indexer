      <field name="fulltext">Mecca Nov. 9 th 1862 My own darling Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am going to try and write you a cheerful letter to day . I say cheerful , and mind you if it is not , it is no fault of mine. You will conclude and rightly that I have had a dread- ful. (please excuse the division of that word) attack of the “ blues ” You will now wish to know the cause. Well, as you are my confidante I will tell you . The first; (you wont tell any-body ?) I have not heard one word from C. M. Tenney , for almost two weeks . (listen now) and when he last wrote me, he was not able to go with the regt . I do so hope he is not so ill as not to be able to write to — to — Addie But what does it mean. He is always so prompt in writing when he is not well. Can not you tell me where he is. and how? If you can I shall be a thousand times obliged.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another,, I wish the 12th of Nov. was passed. Dear Charlie, I almost feel as if instead of gaining a brother I shall lose a sister . I know not why I feel so but it always seems as if sisters did not bear the sam same relation to each other after they are married as before, they never seem to give each other that confi- dence that they did before, but I can not write freely upon this subject even to you, dear. I only wish that you could be here then . that is if I must go and Laurie says I must . Here she sits now writing “farewell letters” — as she says — to her friends. Dear girl! She seems to look forward with an air of resignation rather than happiness. Oh Charlie my heart aches for her But I will not write this to you my own</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You are glad Valandingham was defeated. So was I . What an in s — sult to Chio's brave soldiers was the nomination of such a man — no not a man — a traitor as Valan- dingham. He is now — and always has been working against us — working with all the energy of which demons are capable to destroy this noble republic.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">And how many more “Valandinghams” have we here at the north Treason is not confined here in the south. Even here in Mecca are “Knights of the Golden Circle” bound by the most solemn obliga- tions to aid the rebels in erecting an institution the chief corner stone of which is Slavery Shall they succeed in their purposes: No. never. True Freedom and Slavery are drawing to gether and will soon engage in a dread- ful conflict. God only knows which will conquer. but we hope and trust that America may come forth with more than her original purity and have her truly free May God be with us in our great conflict, and may we ever look to him as our nations savior</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But you will pardon me for not writing a longer letter will you not dearest? I must write to Dora to day . I forgot to tell you that I attended the funeral of Capt. L.D. Kee last tuesday he was killed at Perryville 1 He was buried according to the Masonic order. Laura is telling me a good lot to write you such as "I wish he was home", "I am a Case yet." "I've got a hard cold " &amp;c. &amp;c..</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must bid you the wish of success and goodbye, Please write very soon to your own Adeli</field>
