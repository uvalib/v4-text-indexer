      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia July 6. 1842. My Dear Sir,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I fear you will have accused me of disrespect in not replying to either of your three last letters -but if so, you will have wronged me. Among all my correspond- ents there is not one whose good opinion I am more anxious to retain than your own. A world of perplexing business has led me to postpone, from day to day, a duty which it is al- ways a pleasure to perform.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your two last letters I have not now before me. In the first, you spoke of my notice of yourself in the Autograph Article. The paper had scarcely gone to press before I saw and acknowledged to myself the injustice I had done you -an injust- ice which it is my full purpose to repair at the first opportunity. What I said of your grammatical errors , arose from some imperfect recollections of one or two poems sent to the first volume of the S. L. Messenger. But in more important respects I now deeply feel that I have wronged you by a hasty opinion. You will not suppose me insincere in saying that I look upon some of your late pieces as the finest I have ever read . I allude especially to the poem about Shelley, and the one of which the refrain is -"She came from Heaven to tell me she was blest". Upon reading these compositions I felt the necessity of our being friends. Will you accept my proffer of friendship?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your last favor is dated June 11, and, in writing it, you were doubtless unaware of my having resigned the editorial charge of "Graham's Magazine" . What disposi- tion shall I make of the "Invocation to Spring"? The other pieces are in the hands of my successor, Mr Griswold. +</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It is my intention now to resume the project of the "Penn Magazine". I had made every preparation for the issue of the first number in January 1841, but relinquished the design at Mr Grahams representation of joining me in July, provided I would edit his Mag. in the meantime. In July he put me off until January, and in January until July again. He now finally declines, and I am resolved to push forward for myself. I believe that I have many warm friends, especially in the South and West, and were the journal fairly before the public, I have no doubt of ultimate success. Is it possible that you could afford me any aid, in the way of subscribers among your friends in Middletown?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">As I have no money myself, it will be absolutely ne- cessary that I procure a partner who has some pecuniary means. I mention this to you -for it is not impossible that you yourself may have both the will &amp; the ability to join me. The first number will not appear until January, so that I shall have time to look about me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">With sincere respect &amp; esteem Yours Edgar A Poe Dr Thos. H. Chivers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">+ In the letter enclosing these Poems, I made some critical remarks on the "wishy-washy" verses published by Mr Griswold in Graham's Magazine which which greatly offended him — for which I now reason to believe he never forgave me — although what was therein written was intend for the eyes only of M r Poe.</field>
