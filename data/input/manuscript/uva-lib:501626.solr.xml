      <field name="fulltext">Paroled Prisoner's Camp Annapolis Md. Oct. 18th Dear Sir:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You will doubtless think I have been rather careless in answering your letter but when you hear my excuse I think you will pardon me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your letter was brought to me on Sunday Sept. 14th, on the Battle= ground of South Mountain , before the engagement commenced. You have doubtless heard all the particulars of that hard fought battle. I was taken prisoner about sunset, in a charge on a rebel Battery. I was in the front and left of our reg= iment when the Rebs. outflanked us on the left and several of us were captured. We were marched to Boonsboro and staid their until about 10 'clock at night when the Rebs came through on their re= treat, and we got up and marched to Shepherdstown, Va where we staid that day and the next when they took us back to the rear of the rebel lines where we remained during the battle of Antie= tem, and the next day, when being joined by other prisoners amounting in all to about 400 we commenced our march for Staunton , 120 miles. During our whole march we had nothing to eat but green corn, until the last three days when they gave us a pint of flour each per day and about 1/3 lb of fresh beef, without a pinch of salt for ei= ther. We mixed our flour in the cups and baked it in the ashes. We were 8 days going to Staunton where we arrived on Saturday evening the 27th, when we immediately got on board the cars at and arrived at Richmond next morn= ing. Here I took sick and was hardly able to sit up during my 8 day stay there. I had no medical attendance what= ever. I spoke to two secesh doctors who took my name, but that was the last I ever saw of them. I was placed in a 3d story room of a tobacco ware= house with 180 others. I lay on the hard floor having nothing but a rubber blanket. On the 6th of October we were sent to Hagers Landing , where steamers were waiting to bring us to this place.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I should like to give you the partic= ulars of our the battle and of my capture and imprisonment, but I have not yet fully recovered my health and it is quite a task for me to write. You will excuse bad writing and composition on this account. Answer soon and let me hear all the news from Franklin . Give my best respects to all friends, my love to the gals and reserve my sincere friendship for yourself.</field>
