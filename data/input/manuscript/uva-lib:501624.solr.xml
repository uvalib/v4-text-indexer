      <field name="fulltext">Point Pleasant, Va March April, 9 [1] Dear Friend:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I received a letter from you some time since, which I will now proceed to answer. I should have answered it sooner, but as we were constantly expecting marching orders, I thought I would delay writing until I could tell you our destina= tion .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But as we are now apparently as far from leaving as we were when we first came here, I will now write to you and you can send your answer to this place &amp; I will be likely to receive it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your letters will always be very welcome, as coming from a locality where I have spent a very short portion of my life, and from a friend who I learned to esteem. Should there be any seeming lack of punctuality in my answers you will attribute it to the fact that a military camp is not the best place in the world for writing and that the mails in this part of the country are very irregular.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Spring has finally made its appearance here. Welcome, Spring to all the sons of Mars. We have been wading through mud knee deep all winter, and it seems quite a novelty to walk on terra firma again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">J. C. Fremont has superceded Gen. Rosecrans in this department and made his headquarters at Wheeling , and I hope some= thing may be done this Spring. There is a rumor that we will go to Tennessee . For the last two weeks we have been drilled almost to death. Squad drill from 6 to 7 A.M. Company drill from 9 to 11 A.M. Batalion Drill from 2 to 4 ½ P.M. Dress Parade from 5 to 5 ½ P.M. and n non-commissioned officers school from 7 to 8 in the evening. If we don't soon become a well drilled Regiment, we ought to.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I wrote a letter to Uncle Conrad some time since and received no answer. Will you remind him of it. My respects to all the friends, and compliments to the ladies. Write soon and let it be a long letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your Friend D.R.P. Shoemaker Co. E. 11th Reg. O.V. U.S.A. P.S. The papers you were kind enough to promise will be thankfully received. We get up a small sheet here sometimes called the Eleventh Ohio . I will send you a copy of the next number. D.R.P.S.</field>
