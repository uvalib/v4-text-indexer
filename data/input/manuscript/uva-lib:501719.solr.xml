      <field name="fulltext">Camp 7th, Iowa Louisville, Ky. June 27th 65 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I will write a few lines to let you know I am well, and I hope you may all be in the enjoyment of good health. We are still at the same camp ground about 6 miles east of Louisville . I don't know how long we shall remain here but I hope we shall soon be permitted to go home. Six men of our company are gone home on furlough. The orders are to furlough 12 per cent of the army. I see that some of this army are to be mustered out. I don't venture to say who it may be, nor dont make any calculations. disappointment has already been deep enough but still I hope that we might be once lucky I hope that I shall get home sometime this summer. It is the general impression that our regiment stands a good chance as they are one of the oldest veteran organ izations , only one regiment from Iowa being older, the 2nd I had made calculations of spending the 4th of July some where in Iowa but that cannot be. They are making quiet extensive preparations at the Louisville fair grounds for celebrating the 4th I presume we will be nearer Louisville than Iowa I remember how we spent the last 4th down on the Chatta hoochie , exposed to shell and bullets while we were throwing up breastworks we made remarks, and wondered where we would be next 4th. Well things are much changed for the better since then and I can spend this 4th more pleas antly probably than the last yet I think the next 4th will be better yet The weather is very warm here but here we have a good camp with splendid beech shade trees to lounge under on the grass, I have not heard from you since leaving Washington I have wrote a number of letters I suppose you were expecting me home, but never stop writing till I get there. There has happened quiet a slip between the cup and the lip. [1] We are camped near the Woodlawn race courses, where trotting matches are going on I have not been since the running races closed which was 2 weeks ago, trotting only commenced yesterday. I had the luck of seeing the fastest horses in America run, one Asteroid that has never been beat, but I must close, as I know of nothing more at present</field>
