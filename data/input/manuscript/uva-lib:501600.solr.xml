      <field name="fulltext">Near Harper's Ferry, Md. Sept. 21 st 1862 My darling Addie ;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ere this reaches you, the telegraph will have informed you of the great battle of the 17 th , at Sharpsburg and you will be painfully anxious to learn the fate of your Charlie. Through the mercy of the "God of battles," as heretofore, I came through perfectly safe. To your prayers, precious one, I owe my safety. Day before yesterday, I recieved two letters from you, dated Aug 31 st &amp; Sept. 8 th and Sept. 10 th , one enclosing a note from Dora, and I need not tell you that they were recieved with pleasure, for you already know how I prize your letters. But I owe you an explanation for not writing oftener than I have for the past month, and will give it now. If you have recieved the letters I wrote from near Georgetown and near Rockville, you will have seen why I did not write while on the Rappahannock . The day I wrote you last. we marched some eight miles, and with the exception of two days when it rained. (and we had no shelter.) have been marching or doing some duty equally laborious, thus putting it completely beyond any power to write— part of the time, even in my diary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">So you see that the campaign in Maryland is in fact an arduous one. But I now have the pleasure of writing that Maryland is free from Secesh. After the battle of South Mountain, a week ago today, the Rebels precipitately fled to the vicinity of Sharpsburg , and posted them selves on the hills surrounding the village. They were closely pressed and our men kept them constantly under fire. Tuesday was occupied in feeling their position and a heavy artillery skirmish took place, with some loss on both sides. Our division was formed in column of companies, to be held as a reserve corps. and at night we lay down— as I supposed —for the night. Tattoo sounded and a hush, solemn in its stillness, settled over camp. I had just sank into an easy slumber when the clear notes of a bugle sang out on the breeze, and the bivouac was broken. Hurrying into line, we were marched from the left of the field around some 4½ miles to the right, again going into bivouac about half past one A.M. At daylight we were aroused by a volley of musketry but a short distance from us. The Penna. Reserves were engaged, in less than an hour the engagement became pretty warm, the artillery having joined in the fray. We were called into line, and marched toward the scene of conflict at once meeting the wounded coming in, nearly every rod. We halted a short distance from the field, and twenty five minutes allowed us to make coffee. At the expiration of that time we fell in and marched directly in the face of the enemy who held as usual, a hill surmounted with a belt of woods, where they held at bay some four or five of the Pa. reserve regiments. As we advanced steadily across the open field, we ployed column and advanced in two columns, directly into the woods, delivering our fire as we came up. Our regt. was upon the right of the 2d column and where we were the woods were not very dense, and we soon dislodged the enemy, they then taking cover behind a fence, in a cornfield. As we came upon the brow of the hill, we halted, and poured an incessant fire into their ranks for about 20 minutes, when they began to show signs of unsteadiness. " Charge , bayonets ," exclaimed Col. Tyndale ( comdg. the brigade) and away we went shouting like madmen. Charging over the fence into the ranks of the Secesh, they broke like sheep. leaving the dead and wounded at our mercy— and their name was legion. Away they went, at full speed closely followed by our brave boys, and we chased them into another piece of woods. In this charge, we drove them nearly half a mile, and our brigade captured a twelve pounder rifled cannon, and two stands of colors, while the ground was thickly strewn with small arms, and the dead lay in heaps of tens, twenties, fifties, and even hundreds ! As we neared this 2 d piece of woods, it was discoved that it was under cover of a battery of heavy guns. A battery of Howitzers was immediately ordered up, and they stood an unequal fire until their amunition was completely exhaused, when they were relieved by the 8 th R. I. battery of Parrott guns. Soon it was announced that the enemy was advancing upon the Battery, from the right. We made a half wheel to the right, and lay down behind a ridge of land, just enough to conceal us. Here, recourse was had to strategy. A small force, with the colors, advanced and delivered a weak fire, as though they were the only support to the battery. The bait took. With a yell, they dashed out of the woods hoping to make our guns an easy prey, but at the word " Up boys and at them ," with a cheer which rent the air, we rose and poured a deadly volley into the advancing col- umn . They halted, reeled a moment, and would have broken, had it not been for the firmness of their officers. They rallied, but did not advance. We continued to rain bullets into their midst; till they finally gave way before the impetuosity of our men. Again Col. Tyndale ordered us forward and we held the second hill. Our company was immediately thrown out into the woods as skirmishers and for about an hour we held our position against Gen. A.P. Hill's entire division ! About 12 oclock, the 13 th New Jersey regt. came up to relieve us, and our regiment fell back being completely out of ammunition About half past one P.M., a panic was seen to spread in the ranks of the 13 th (just named), and they soon broke and ingloriously fled the field. The panic spread even to our own brigade and regardless of the commands and entreaties of the officers, they left the field. Seeing them thus giving way, Major Crane immediately formed the remnant of our brave Seventh, upon our colors, and vainly endeavored to stay the retreating column—but it seemed as though the New Jersey regt. was bound to be defeated. The rebels advanced, but their triumph was short lived, for they advanced directly between our right and left wings and they closed upon them driving them back in precipitancy losing some 600 prisoners, and very many killed and wounded. Thus the day field was saved. Gen. Green withdrew our division from the field but the fight continued uninterruptedly until after dark. Our victory is complete and decisive, and our brigade has covered itself with new glory, and the Seventh is proud of its laurels. The regt. lost 5 killed, and 33 wounded. Co. H. lost one killed—Henry Bacon and one wounded—H. J. Bell. I was under fire the entire day, not leaving the company, and how I escaped is truly wonderful to me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I went over the field day before yesterday, and I wish never to see the like again. The ground for as far as the eye can reach, was literally covered with dead bodies, still unburied. I can- not here describe the scenes of that field so I will dismiss the subject, with "Three cheers for Gen. M c Clellan," who says "the Ohio boys cant be beaten." Col. Tyndale was killed just before the brigade fell back.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After a tedious march to Maryland Heights, we found yesterday that Jackson had crossed the Potomac , and left Maryland .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If I had time, I would like to tell you all about this country but, the mail closes in 15 minutes. We hope to soon have 24 hours rest when I will write, until I can—well I will write you a very long letter—answer Dora's write to Laura, &amp; your Papa.—give Hal. a scolding for not writing to me, &amp;c. &amp;c. Dont consider this as an answer to your charming letters, for I shall do that in a little better style; but I write now on a stone, sitting upon the ground, and the sun shining very hotly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I suppose your school has closed, did you have a good time, at the close? But my time is nearly up and we move soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Remember me to Dora, and the rest and tell Laurie I will write as soon as possible.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Be happy, my darling, and dont forget to pray for, and write to,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Your devoted Charlie . Direct Co. H. 7 th Ohio Regt. 1 st Brigade, 2 d Division. Bank's' Army Corps. Washington D.C.</field>
