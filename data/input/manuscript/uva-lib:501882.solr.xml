      <field name="fulltext">Elmira , Monday Friend Bliss:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yrs rec'd enclosing check for $703.35. The old "Innocents" holds out handsomely.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I feel confident that House will make a most readable blook book. Shall write him what you say.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I have MS. enough on hand now, to make ( al- lowing for engravings) about 400 pages of the book — consequently am two-thirds done. I intended to run up to Hartford about the middle of the week &amp; take it along; [illeg.] because it has chapters in it that ought by all means to be in the prospectus; but I find myself so thoroughly interested in my work, now (a thing I have not experienced for months) that I can't bear to lose a single moment of the inspiration. So I will stay here &amp; peg away as long as it lasts. My present idea is to write as much more as I have already written, &amp; then cull from the mass the very best chapters &amp; discard the rest. I am not half as well satisfied with the first part of the book as I am with what I am wri- ting now. When I get it done I want to see the man who will begin to read it &amp; not finish it. If it falls short of the Innocents in any respect I shall lose my guess.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">When I was writing the Innocents my daily "stent" was 30 pages of MS &amp; I hardly ever got beyond it; but I have gone over that nearly every day for the last ten. That shows that I am writing with a red-hot interest. No- thing grieves me now — nothing troubles ; me, bothers me or gets my attention — I don't think of any- thing but the book, &amp; don't have an hour's unhap- piness about anything &amp; don't care two cents whe- ther school keeps or not. It will be a bully book. If I keep up my present lick three weeks more I shall be able &amp; willing to scratch out half of the chapters of the Over- land narrative — &amp; shall do it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You do not mention having received my second batch of MS , sent a week or two ago — about 100 pages.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you want to issue a prospectus &amp; go right to canvassing, say the word &amp; I will forward some more MS — or send it by hand — special messenger. Whatever chapters you think are unquestionably good, we will retain of course, &amp; so they can go into a prospectus as well one time as another. The book will be done soon, now. I have 1200 pages of MS al- ready written, &amp; am now wri- ting 200 a week — more than that, in fact; during past week wrote 23 one day, then 30, 33, 35, 52, &amp; 65. — [illeg.] How's that?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It will be a starchy book, &amp; should be full of snappy pictures — especially pictures worked in with the letter-press. The dedica tion will be worth the price of the volume — thus:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">T o t he L ate C ain This Book is Dedicated:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not on account of re- spect for his memory, for it merits little respect; not on ac- count of sympathy with him, for his bloody deed placed him without the pale of sympathy, strictly speaking: but out of a mere humane commiseration for him in that it was his misfortune to live in a dark age that knew not the beneficent I nsanity P lea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I think it will do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ys Clemens. P.S.The reaction is beginning &amp; my stock is looking up. I am getting the bulliest offers for books &amp; almanacs, am flooded with lecture invitations, &amp; one periodical offers me $6,000 cash for 12 articles, of any length &amp; on any sub- ject , treated humorously or otherwise.</field>
