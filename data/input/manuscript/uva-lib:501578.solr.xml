      <field name="fulltext">Camp of the Seventh Patterson's creek Station Jan. 12 th My dearest Addie:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here we are after a retreat of about twenty four miles, at the place denoted above. I say retreat for I know not what else to term it for we have entirely withdrawn all troops, even picket from Romney &amp; Springfield toward Cumberland. What the object is, I know not, unless it is like Gen. Rosecrans' 1 movement from Sewell Mountain, 2 oig to lure them back to those positions in order to whip them severely. If such is the case, it will prove a sorry advance for the Rebels. But I suppose you are "dying to know" the details of the march . Well I cannot do better than to make extracts from my diary. So you must excuse all the imperfections for it was written for myself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">" Jan. 10 th :- If a person needs excitement to live, surely a soldier in the valley of the Potomac does not lack the required stimulus. But in my way of thinking , the excitement we have is not of a kind. For a rumor once started never loses any thing in circulation, and but on the contrary, by the time it reaches our Reg't. , it is calculated to put us into such a state as to deprive us of rest for some time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">After listening to hundreds of such reports" as I wrote of to you the other day "today at 3 oclock we had dress parade and were dismissed to prepare to march. and we acted accordingly.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Jany 11 th Last night at mid= night we left Romney, desti= nation unknown. After march= ing over exceedingly muddy roads till we got to Springfield, (8 miles from R. ) we halted until day- light. From S. we went to Frankfort , a distance of 7 miles. from thence to Patterson's Creek Station on the B.&amp;O. R.R. (8m) where we are now encamped in six inches of snow &amp; mud. The march was unusually severe, being about 24 miles, over exceed ing bad roads . Many of the boys are nearly tired out."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Hal is well and stood the march first-rate. We would have done much better if it had not rained so in the afternoon of the 11 th . But I will not complain, if I can serve my country</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Do you ever indulge in the pleasant recreation of making poetry? It is something I seldom do. If you doubt my inability though, I will en- close a sample. Do not flatter me now &amp; say it is good nor the other way &amp; say nonsense. Seriously, though it is but the expression of my heart. The first two stanzas are from "Fugitive Poems, by a member of the Va. Legislature" the remainder is "all mine" !!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Though nev'r before I threw my eye, Upon thy gentle face, Yet by the earth the sea the sky. My heart would thine embrace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"Thy gentle form is Cupid's quiver, Thy modest blush the dart. By which the youthful boy would shiver My unoffending heart."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Though wounded by the magic dart, Which Cupid loves to throw, To cure the pain, 'twill take the art, That none, but thee, can know.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then Love, exert the wondrous pow'r By which the deed is done, And are we close the present hour, Thy heart will claim its own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Then happy in the new found pleasure, We'll prove the cure divine. And let the world think at their leisure. "The work's of him that's blind"</field>
      <field name="fulltext">There, now don't you think I am a real, live poet? But, this is something I seldom allow myself to do. perhaps I have done wrong in sending these lines to you, but my conscience does not reprove me. How I wish I could take the cars tonight and fly to old happy Trumbull my home, and to you, my sister</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But does Laurie ever call me "brother Charlie," Have I not good reason to be happy, while I can call Addie, "Sister" and Hal "Brother"?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">But I must close. write often to Your own affectionate Charlie. Address "Valley of Virginia via Cumberland" care of Capt Asper C.N.T</field>
