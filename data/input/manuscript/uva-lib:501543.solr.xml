      <field name="fulltext">East Claridon July 2 nd 1862 My darling,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If I thought there was so much happiness for me as the probability of soon seeing my loved Charlie I would not write this morning but as every thing generally goes contrary to our wishes and expectations. I doubt not but that such will prove to be the case now. I do not know why I had so anxiously waited and looked for your return, this 4 th but as the drowning man catches at a straw. I clung to the little encouragement. Lieut Brisvine gave you. and even now I shudder at the thought of abandoning that hope. There is scarcely a day but that I hear of some soldier coming home to meet his friends, and when I think of Charlie so long absent. I find myself fervently wishing that others were obliged to stay away as long as he. I know it is a cruel wicked wish. but it is perfectly natural for human beings to wish for someone to share their trials as well as their joys or at least to sympathize with them and when I see others so happy because a dear friend has returned from from the wars, I wonder why such happiness is given to some and denied to others. You will call me an "ungrate- ful little minx" as Hallie says. but refer the case to yourself. Look way down in the naughty corners. (If you have such) of your heart and if you do not find just such rebellious thoughts, striving so hard to get the control. then call me a poor judge. But you will say I am arguing both sides will you not?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am dying to hear the news in yesterdays paper. The report in mondays paper was that Richmond had fallen. or --risen. I guess the latter. at least that Uncle Sam had/has it again. and I wish so much to have it confirmed. I can hardly wait to hear, Would that peace could be declared the fourth. would not that memorable day be doubly dear? Dear Charlie. my scholars are coming and making such a noise that I must cease writing for the present.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Accept the love and blessings of your Addie</field>

      <field name="fulltext">July 3 rd My darling:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Conflicting emotions are now raging in my heart. Last night I heard the m news. that desperate fighting was going on at Richmond. that 1200 of our brave men were already lying cold and insensible upon the field and what is worse. not an inch has been gained, For a few days dearest. I have lost all knowledge of your position and who knows. oh heaven forbid. but that you are there sharing the perils of the battle field. Oh. Charlie. why does cruel fate thus separate us. Why are you so far away. suffering often for want of the comforts of life. alone while I can remain at home in security surrounded by kind friends all striving to make my life a happy one. but dearest I am far from happy this morning. Could I but be with you. even on the dreaded battle field. I should be happier than now. Bitter very bitter are my feelings this morning. darling. but I can not control them. I am not fit to discharge the duties lying before me to- day. for I have no control o v er my feelings whatever. If there would but come a shower thunder. lightning and rain mingle together in one great storm and commotion. I should feel better. but the sun shines just as bright the birds sing just as sweetly and all nature is just as gay as if no pitiless war was raging over our land leaving desolate hearths sobbing children and broken hearted wives. in all parts of the Unitid states. It seems so like mockery. this beautiful morn. when my poor heart aches so hard But these fears may be all unfounded and you may laugh--no you will never do that dearest.- but if they are unfounded I thank God for it. But dear, I must close as it is near school time.</field>
