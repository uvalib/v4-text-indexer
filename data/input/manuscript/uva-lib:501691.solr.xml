      <field name="fulltext">Alone Mills Dec. 8 th 1867 My dear wife</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I recieved your letter yesterday eavning; was truly glad to hear from my better half. Indeed I had beagan to be very ancious to hear from Rose Dale. espescially one of its ocupan ts. If it had not been so far &amp; I was busy I would have made my apperance aroung the family circle at Rosedale. Indeed it would have given me a great deal of pleasure to embrace my dear wife. My health is very good with the ex ception of the headache today. I have been suffering with it all morning But hope it may be well by morning I have been enjoying very good health since I was down. Hope this may find you still improving &amp; happy Recieved a letter yesterday eavning from cousin Mollie Colman directed to my Kate wich I as before took the privalige of opening. I will enclose it in this to you., Hope you will not centure me for the privileges I have taken the letter is very hard to read There may be sense in it but is hard to get out, I think our Photographs are very good. Yours I am very much pleased with. the attraction was so grate that my lips ware naturally drawn toward it. I bought very little at the sale. evry thing was old &amp; roughſ. I got a dining table but as Ma intends to give us one I can trade the one I got for a good safe. wich we will need. I got a good coffee mill &amp; one or two other articles. The chairs ware so indifferent that I would not bid for any. I have laid in over three hundred lbs of Pork Made some sosage &amp; rendered out the lard ready for use. So you need not be scared I will give you plenty of meat &amp; bread to eat if nothing more &amp; I am sure we will never starve. In regard to mooving up. I would rather your Pa would moove us up for it would cost me eight or ten dollars to get a team to moove us up. Very likely I could get Bro. J. to moove us up. I do not know whether he is busy with his machine or note. I am glad that Sis Ann has not given up coming up with us. I will find tranportation for you &amp; her If I do have to drive the cows, I hope the weather may remain as beautifull as it is today so that we may not be de layed by bad roads &amp; inclement weather. Will hope for the best. Nearly dark; my head has quit aching. I took a short nap this eave something new with me Evry time I go to the land of dreams I meet with my absent Kate It will not be long untill I may realize my night dreams. I will be down Saturday if thare be no pres venting providence. Either Carriage Buggie or horse back. I will close as it is getting so dark I cannot see how to moove straight acroſs the page. Give my love to one &amp; all, &amp; reserve a double portion for your self If you are writing today I will recieve it before I come down. Now may bright angels protect the from all harm is the prayer of your loving husband.</field>
