      <field name="fulltext">Camp Near The New Bridge on Chicahamonie March The 1 th 1864 [1] My Dear Cousin</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I take this opportunity of respond en to your most kind an interresten letter of the 10 th of last month which was so long coming to hand I had be gon to think that you had given out writen to me any more. or had written an I had failed to get your letter. tho I serpose your letter wer on the road longer than it ort to have bin, I wish I had some good news to write you. but have nothen of interest to write. I believe the helth of the soldiers here are very good tho they all seem to be lo sperited . They think the time is draw- en ny when they will be cald erpon a gain to meet thare ine myes on the field a gain . an to think that thare is no relief for them but that they have got to still remain in the field, they have bin try en to get the men to reinlist for the war an thare have been a great meney of the men reinlisted The Govenour [2] came out the other day an made us a speech an tride to get the men to reinlist for the war, an when he had quit speeken the Colonel had us all in line an then had the Cullars cared to the front and then told all the men that he wanted all who wer determen to be freemen to step out on the line with the cullars and all who wer willen to be slaves for thare enemyes to stand fast an I wreaken thare wer a bout one third of the men went on line with the cullars and the rest stood fast, I dideant inten to reinlist nor I wes not willen to be a Slave for my enemyes and I dident go on line with the reinlisted , and I dideant wish to bee in eather line. Colonel Cabel [3] new very well that thare wer nun of the men that thort thot any thing of them selves ar thare Country that wer willen to becom Slaves for thare enemyes . The colonel thot by telen the men what he did he would get all the men to come on line with the Cullars an be considered reinlisted . but he faild to get them, tho thare have a great meny of them reinlisted sence the officers thinks if we will reinlist it will have a bad er fect on the yankees. tho they have past a bill to hold us in service and I dont no what good it will dood for us to reinlist I am of the opinion that if we wer to reinlist it would have a bad effect on our leaden men, [4] it looks like our leaden men thinks wee are willen to stay an fight all the time and never get tiered , an I beleave that as long as we will stay here an express a willinness to stay here our leaden men will ceep the war up, I be leave that we mout have hud piece be fore this time if our head leaden men would would have tride, when the enemy offered to make a complemise our men wount here too it, so I am not in favor of reinlisten tho all that want to doo so I am wilin, I can bee just as good a soldier without reinlisten as I can with it. far I be leave that we will all have to serve any way without we desert and that I never want to doo as long as they will treat me like illeg. officers orte to treat men, tho they are fitten a very good way now to make men wars stil dissatisfide than they are now. by given the reinlisted men furlows first. I am due a furlow now and come next for one in our company by rights but because I did not reinlis I get cut out of furlough. an they are due me a furlow for reinlis in sixty too , for thirty days which I have never got, I refused to rein list this time an all of our company did exsept two an they are both recrutes which is in for twelve months longer any way, one of them ha never bin in ranks sence he be long to the company he has bin acten as comimasary all the time an the other one deserted the first time we went in to Mary land summer be fore last be fore the serrende of harpers farry an stade at home a bout fifteen months at home. and then came an joind the scitry Betalion in Richmond an got a fur low an went home an wer er rested an Broat Back to our company, this man now reinlist thinken it would make his cart marcial go a little lite er with him, gets a furlow an goes home be fore I doo that have bin here an dun my duty all the time as a soldier art to have dun doo you think thare is any justice in such a way doo en , as tha I tel you thare is no justice in it, I went up an give the Col a talkin a bout it last nigtn , and if he dont give me a fur lough be fore he des this deserter I wil bee very much er temp er to tel him what I think of him an take a discharge, I be leave in the for thing al ways if they wir not given no fur lows I could stay here an nor think hard of it but when they a are given furl an it comes to my time I want it, I will stop this chat for I wreaken you had rather here som then elce that is more interrestin Thare have bin a good eal of exsite ment here to day a bout the yankees makin a rade below here be teen Hanover Junction and Lieueasia CH and have bin tar ing the track up Thare have bin a continuel canonaden down that way all day to day an they have sent all of our Brigade from here exsept our Regt an a large potion of it is on Pickett we have orders to be ready to fall in, in a minute to Prevent ar rade, Should ent be serprised if we dont have to leave before day, you wished to no what they had don with Curt Inman [5] he he wer left at newbon I serpose he got be hand the nigh we left thare an wer taken Prisoner Some of the fifty third said he wer broken down I dident see him that night I saw him a few minutes before we Started Back, Memory Inman [6] wer cart marcialed an his sintance wer to doo Po leas duty for his Regt one hour each day for seven days an the Cart said it wes thus lenient on him on acount of his good conduct be fore, he havent had to doo any of his duty yet an I dont reaken he will have to doo any of it, I hope not Lin Cary Brown I have never herd any thing from him exsept what I herd from home, he never has come to his company yet, its all together a mistake about his comen to his Regt at Kinston if he had of come thare I would have herd som thing a bout it far we wer all rite together Capt. Jno A. Herndon got a thirty days furlow to go home to get married I reaken he is going to take a Miss Beavers, as my paper is nearly fild I will have to stop I hope you will not think hard of this letter for I have bin mad all day an could not write what I wanted to write, I dont exspect you can read this last page I have wrote it by fire ligh, an thare wer so much fuss I could not rite</field>
