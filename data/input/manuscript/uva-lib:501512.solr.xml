      <field name="fulltext">East Mecca At Aunt Sperry's. Dec. 19 th 1861 Dear Charlie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Not knowing your address I consequently have two letters from my noble friend in the service of his once happy country to answer. Therefore I will begin with the first. I recieved it same as I would recieve a strangers. Not that I wished it as a strangers but it had been so long since I had been the happy recipient of a letter from my friend that I scarcely knew how to recieve itâ€” unless with joy. I almost thought that I had been wafted far down Lethe's stream 1 but happily found myself mistaken.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear Charlie please do not pass such enconviences on your unworthy correspondent as The sweetest beings God ever made for it is not correct. If you knew what a wicked and rebellious heart Addie possessed you would not think her quite the sweetest being. You reques- ted me to write you if you wrote anything contrary to my wishes, and I have done so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I sincerely hope you have not so severe weather as you had when you wrote me. I told auntie this morn that I would the soldier had as warm a room as I had to sleep in this winter. What very pleasant weather we have had for the past week there has scarcely been a cloud to obscure the beautiful sun and the roads are quite dry and good. December is surely as pleasant as May.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">You wished to know when I intended going to Oberlin . I think I shall go at the commencement of the spring term which commences in February. I think I shall enjoy it very much as I always do when I attend school. I intend to remain with auntie till then and attend school here at the corners which I have commenced to do.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dear friend and brother I am very thankful that you regard your health as you do. Few know the enjoyment of good health I wish you to regard your health above all other things.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Laurie lives here so you see we are together besides we have our melodeon 2 here which is a great deal of company for us. But it is time fore me to go to afternoon school till then goodbye when I will answer you last letter</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Yours etc, Addie Dear Charlie. forgive my negligence in almost forgetting to thank you for the house that Uncle Sam built.</field>
