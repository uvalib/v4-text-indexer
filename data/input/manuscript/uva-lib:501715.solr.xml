      <field name="fulltext">Near Atlanta July 31st 64 Dear Father</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I take the opportunity of writing to you again We are here in sight of Atlanta 's spires but do not yet occupy the city it appears that the rebs are going to stand a siege I am well I think that all their railroad are cut all except the Macon road is at least &amp; that is reported to be. So I think that a successful campaign is commencing on Atlanta We have got very good breastworks &amp; so have the enemy. I think there will be a short delay here until the completion of the railroad bridge across the Chattahoochie &amp; the arrival of heavy ordnance which is on the way Our Corps has changed position since I wrote last we evacuated our works on the left &amp; came here on the right &amp; on the west side of Atlanta You asked me whose command I was under I am in the 1st Brigade 2nd Div 16 Arm Corps Gen Dodge Corps Commander Div Gen Coarse Brigade Gen Rice. The rebels have amused themselves by trying to shell us with their siege guns but I have not heard of their hurting anything much with their 84 pound shell which is occasionally thrown over us I think it will not be long before they get some pills of their own bigness &amp; more than they want. Gov Stone was here the other day making stump speeches to the boys I would have liked to have heard him but we were on the skirmish line We heard a good deal of cheering &amp; thought there must be some good news so when we were relieved at night we found out the cause. I have seen the call for 500000 more men &amp; if they can be raised it is just what we want to knock down the staggering Confederacy It is time for this thing to come to an end &amp; now is the time The soldiers are getting exceeding anxious if we have not men enough let the country do its utmost to furnish them &amp; and help put on the finishing touch to the rebellion Write soon I can write no more at present</field>
