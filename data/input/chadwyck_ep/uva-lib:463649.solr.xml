I LEIFF luif, my luif, no langir I it lyk, Altir our amowris in to observance; Eschew Ã¾e sword of vengence, or it stryk; Oure lust, and plesance turne we in pennance; Of misdeidis mend; of kissing mak conscience. Confess our sinnis, and Sathanas oursett; Puneis oure flesche for oure grit offence; Haif eye to God, and brek Ã¾e Divellis nett. II Voluptuous lyfe, quhy Ã¾inkis Ã¾ow so sweit, Knawing Ã¾e deiÃ¾e Ã¾at no man may evaid? Syne persaveris in fleschelie lust and heit, Now sawis may Ã¾e frome Ã¾y synnis dissuaid, Contempning God, of nocht Ã¾at hes Ã¾e maid; Trusting into Ã¾is brukill lyfe and vane; Repent in tyme, devoid Ã¾e of Ã¾is laid, And knaw in hell Ã¾air is eternall pane! ANE AIGIT MANIS INVECTIVE AGAINST MOUÃ ÃANKLESS. I Ane aigit man, twyss fourty yeiris, Eftir Ã¾e haly dayis of Yule, I hard him say, amangis Ã¾e Freiris Of Ordour Gray, makand grit dule, Rycht as he wer a furiuss fule, Oft syiss he sicht, and said, Allace! Be Chryst, my cair ma nevir cule, Ãat evir I schervit MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless! II Ãroch ignorance and foly youÃ¾ My preterit tyme I wald nevir spair, Plesans to put in to Ã¾at mowÃ¾, Quhill Eild said, Fule, latt be Ã¾y fair: And now my heid is quhyt and hair, For feding of Ã¾at fowmart face, Quhairfoir I murn bayÃ¾ laitt and air, Ãat evir I schervit MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless. III Gold and silver that I micht gett, Brochis, beisandis, robbis and ringis, Frely to gife I wald nocht lett, To pleiss Ã¾a mullis attour all Ã¾ingis. Rycht as Ã¾e swan for sorrow singis Befoir hir deid ane littell space, Rycht so do I, and my handis wringis, Ãat evir I schervit MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless. IV Bettir it war ane man to serf, WiÃ¾ wirchep and honour undir a scheild, Nor hir to pleiss, Ã¾ocht Ã¾ow suld sterf, Ãat will nocht luke on Ã¾e in eild. Fra Ã¾at Ã¾ow haif no hair to heild Thy heid fra harmyng Ã¾at it hess, Quhen pen and purss and all is peild, Tak Ã¾air a meiss of MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless. V And in example it may be sene, Ãe grund of trewÃ¾ quha vndirstude, Fra in Ã¾y bag Ã¾ow beir Ã¾yne ene, Ãow gettis no grace, bott for Ã¾y gud, At Venus closet, for to conclude; Call ye nocht Ã¾iss ane kankert caiss? Now God help, and Ã¾e Haly Rude, And keip all men fra MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless. VI O brukill yowÃ¾, in tyme behald, And in Ã¾yne hairt Ã¾ir wirdis graif, Or Ã¾y complexioun gadder cald, Amend Ã¾y miss, Ã¾y self to saif, Ãe hevynis bliss gif Ã¾ow wilt haif, And of Ã¾y gilt remit and grace. All Ã¾is I hard ane auld man raif, Eftir Ã¾e Yule, of MowÃ¾-Ã¾ankless. [Finis] quod Kennedy. THE PRAISE OF AIGE. I At matyne houre, in middis of Ã¾e nicht, Walknit of sleip, I saw besyd me sone Ane aigit man, semit sextie ?eiris of sicht, Ãis sentence sett, and sang it in gud tone: âOmnipotent and eterne God in throne! To be content and lufe Ã¾e I haif causs Ãat my licht ?owÃ¾-heid is ourpassit and done: Honor wiÃ¾ aige to every vertew drawis.â II Grene ?owÃ¾! to aige Ã¾ow mon obey and bow, Ãy foly lustis lestis skant ane May; Ãat Ã¾an wes witt, is naturall foly now, As warldly honor, riches, or fresche array. Deffy Ã¾e devill, dreid God and domisday. For all sall be accusit, as Ã¾ow knawis; Blissit be God, my ?uthheid is away: Honor with aige to every vertew drawis. III O bittir ?owth, Ã¾at semis so delicious! O swetest aige, Ã¾at sumtyme semit soure! O rekless ?owth, hie, hait, and vicious! O halie aige, fullfillit with honoure! O frawart ?owthe, fruitless and fedand flour, Contrair to conscience, laith to God and lawis, Off all vane gloir the lamp and the mirrour! Honor with aige to every vertew drawis. IV Ãis warld is sett for to dissaive wss evin, Pryde is Ã¾e nett, and covetece is Ã¾e trane; For na reward, except Ã¾e joy of hevin, Wald I be ?ung into Ã¾is warld agane. Ãe schip of faiÃ¾ tempestous wind and rane Dryvis in Ã¾e see of Lollerdry Ã¾at blawis; My ?owÃ¾ is gane, and I am glaid and fane: Honor wiÃ¾ aige to every vertew drawis. V Law, luve, and lawtie, gravin law Ã¾ay ly; Dissimvlance hes borrowit conscience clayis; Aithis, writt, walx, nor seilis ar nocht set by; Flattery is fosterit baith with freindis and fayis. Ãe sone, to bruike it Ã¾at his fader hais, Wald se him deid; SaÃ¾anas sic seid sawis. YouÃ¾heid, adew, ane of my mortall fais: Honour wiÃ¾ aige to every vertew drawis. Finis. Q. Kennedy. ANE BALLAT IN PRAISE OF OUR LADY. I Clostir of Christ, riche recent flour-de-lyss, Ave Maria, herbar of amouris! Princess of hevyn, hell, erd, and paradyss, Ãat baÃ¾is our blak syn wiÃ¾ Ã¾y balmy schouris, Nuryss to God, and modir of favouris To leper, leche, cruikit, blynd, deif, and dum, Ãe all Ã¾e ordouris of hevyne honouris, Sancta Maria, Virgo virginum! II Protectrix till all pepill penitent, Ãe beriale bosome, Ã¾at our bliss in bred, Sched betuix synnaris and Godis jugement, Schawand Ã¾y Son Ã¾e sweit palpis Ã¾at him fed, Prayand him for Ã¾e precious blud he bled, Us to forgeif of our gret trespass; Ãy corps was nevir wiÃ¾ corruptioun cled, Sancta et immaculata virginitas! III Revar of grace, Ã¾at sall us all releif, Above Natur consavit God and Man; Our heretage Ã¾at Adam tynt, and Eif, Ãow conquest newe, ourcome Ã¾e Devill and wan! Blist be Ã¾ow Mary, and Ã¾y modir An, And Joachim Ã¾at generit Ã¾e [also;] For till exalt Ã¾y name quha may or can? Quibus te laudibus referam nescio. IV Ãe modir se, fludis, lochis, and wellis, War all Ã¾ir ynke, and quyk and deid couÃ¾ wryte, Ãe hevyne stellat, planetis, montanis and fellis, War fair perchiament, and all as Virgillis dyte, And plesand pennis for to report perfyte War woddis, forestis, treis, gardingis and gravis, CouÃ¾ nocht discryve Ã¾y honouris infinit! Speciosa facta es et suavis. V Onely abone all virginis Ã¾ow had hap, To consaif be Ã¾e Haly Gaist, I grant; Sanct Jhone joyit in his modiris wame and lap, Quhen Ã¾ow spak wiÃ¾ ElizabeÃ¾ Ã¾y ant; Ãow was ay meike, but vane glore, pryd, or want, Sibilla said, alss Balaam and Sanct Dave; Ãarfore Christ chesit Ã¾y wame his house and hant, Dominus sit tecum, gracia plena Ave! VI Ruby of reuÃ¾, riche lass, and hevinnis gem, Blenke up wiÃ¾ Ã¾y eyne of grace owt of Ã¾e est; Supposs all Sanctis our synfull prayer contempne, Ãyne eres are ay opyn at our requesst; Now for Ã¾e speir Ã¾at Longius set in rest, And persit Ã¾y sonnis preciouss hert for us, Ãow bring us to Ã¾e joye Ã¾at nevir is cest, Benedicta tu in mulieribus! VII Blist be Ã¾y hair, hed, eyne, face and neiss! Blist be Ã¾y halss, breist bane, bak and rib! Blist be Ã¾y palpis Ã¾at couÃ¾ Ã¾y sone appleiss! Blist be Ã¾y handis Ã¾at wande him in Ã¾e crib! Blist be Ã¾y sydis, and wame Ã¾at maid us sib To Christ! Blist be Ã¾y body all forÃ¾y! Blist be Ã¾y blude, Ã¾at come of Josues trybe! Et benedictus fructus ventris tui. VIII Ãocht we brek vowis, prayeris, pilgrimage and hechtis, To Ã¾e, Rosare, and rute of our remeid, For us, fair Lady, wiÃ¾ Ã¾e Devill Ã¾ow fechtis, And standis full neir us in Ã¾e hour of deid; Saifand our sawlis frome Ã¾e playand leid Of hell, quhair it servit to be tane to; Syne stowis us saifly in to Angellis steid. Cum Jhesu Christo filio tuo! IX Beseike Ã¾y Sone, Ã¾at for me gaf na pryce Of riche gold, bot Ã¾e reid blude of his hert, To purge me of my gret trespass and vyce, And clenge my saull fra lipper syne inwart; And grant Ã¾at of Ã¾e hevin I may haif part, Ãrow Ã¾y request, Mary, as wele Ã¾ow can! Sen hale supple to Kennedy Ã¾ow art, O mater Dei, memento mei, Ã¾y man! THE PASSIOUN OF CHRIST. PROLOGUE. I Hail, Cristin Knycht! Haill, etern confortour! Haill, Riall King, in trone celistiall! Haill, Lampe of Licht! Haill, Jhesu Saluitour, In Hevin empire Prince perpetuall! Haill, in distres Protectour principall! Haill, god and man, borne of a virgin cleyne! Haill, boist of balme, spilit within my splene! II Haill, in my Hert with Lufe wippit Intern! Haill, spice of taist, to heir sueit sympheony! Haill, silk to graipe, to sicht rycht lycht in dern, To feit futebrode! Haill, gide to gude herbry! Haill, dern closit till woundit and very! Haill, bed till rest! Haill, saulis habitakill! Haill, beyme to skaill of ded Ã¾e dirk vmbrakill! III In till oure Hert, quhill Ã¾ou art herbriour, We ar wiser Ã¾an wes King Salomone; Throu spirituall pith moir potent protectour, Stranger Ã¾an Hectour, Judas, or Sampson; Farar be fer Ã¾an ever wes Absalon; Richer in grace Ã¾an Alexander Ã¾e Gret; Waldin as wynd, be grace eth for to tret. IV Fra Ã¾ou disluge for our iniquite, We ar waker Ã¾an ever wes Fermilus, Quhilk wes all mait, be gret infirmite; Als lazar than ever wes Lazarus; As struttioun stif, as tigar tiranus; Mair pure of gude Ã¾an wes Diogynes; Wilder in wit than Nabell Carnales. V Thus to Ã¾e saule sen life is [Ã¾i] presence, Off the is gude to haue possessioun; Quhilk may nocht be bot [we] with deligence Baith nycht and day remember Ã¾i passioun; And of Ã¾i glore sall haue fruicioun Bot he Ã¾at studyis heirefter his estait, Thy cruell deid with piete to regrait. VI But now, allace! men ar mair studyus To reid the Seige of Ã¾e toun of Tire, The Life of Tursalem, or Hector, or Troylus, The vanite of Alexanderis empire; Bot quhen Ã¾e warld sall all birn in a fire, Than wane storyis sall mak na remeid, Bot all thair helpe man cum Ã¾rou Cristis deid. VII Bot sen our natour is of sic a kind, That euer it seikis consolacioun, He is maist wise Ã¾at dalie hes in mynd, Himself to keip in occupacioun; Quhairon Ã¾e spirit hes delectacioun, Profit to Ã¾e saule, his God worschip and dreid, Confort Ã¾e hert, but lesing of his meid. VIII Bot sen mony in will ar rycht mychty, Quhilk in deid ar pure be Ignorance, Throu helpe of Him quhilk deit on Ã¾e tre, In inglis toung I think to mak remembrance How God maid man; how man fell throu myschance; Syne, how greit pyne sustenit for his synne The Sone of God, or he wald succour him. IX In [this] process I think als coumonly For till exclud all curiosite, Maist plane termes with deligence to spy, Quhilk may be tane with small deficulte; Bot gif me causs instant necessitie Termes to find, quhilk hes na ganand sound, That Ã¾aim till hide, the better wald confound. X Be naturall gift nane to Ã¾e end may bring Gude purpois tane, bot [he] him gid with grace, In quhilk of natour hes sober conforting, The help of him in caussis in Ã¾is caiss; Quhilk for my saule Ã¾e bitter deid can bras Apoun Ã¾e croce, in price of his ransoun; Sa, in Ã¾is hope, my purpois now I foune. EXPLICIT PROLOGUS. INCIPIT PASSIO. I God of his grace and gudness infinit Sa nobill maid Ã¾e man, his creatour, That of himselfe [he] knawlage had perfite, Als of his Godheid, and vthir creatur; Throu grace of God, nocht of his awin natour, He micht haue stand quhill God to grace him brocht, But pane, or dreid; but he vnwislie wrocht. II He wrocht vnwise, allace! throu Lucifeir, Quhilk causit him to dissobey his king, Quhen he till Eue as sserpent couth appeir, And causit hir Ã¾e appill for to bring To fader Adam, that he mycht, throw taisting Off Ã¾e appill, be lik to God, and kend Baith gude and Ill; bot Ã¾at wes nocht Ã¾e end. III The end wes war, for Ã¾an banist he wes Be Ã¾e angell, and put out of paradice, He and his seid, euer in Ã¾is warld to pass, Wanderand in wa, as man in nycht glaidles; In cauld and heit his neidis to purches; As woundit wycht in natour bair of grace, Put to Ã¾e horn, exilit fra Goddis face. IV Silit he wes vnder schaddew of syn, Quhilk him deput euer with deid to duell, As bandonit knycht, and till law bundin, Heir to thoile reist, syne fechit be to hell; He had no mycht fra him for to appeill, For perty wes the Prince of maist poweir, Eternall God quhilk had him presoneir. V Fra he wes presonit yeris mony ane As Goddis fa, closit within myrknes, Marcy and Piete maid ane full hevy mane That Ã¾ai wer tynt, for mankind gat na grace; In hevin empire, befor the Faderis face Thai apperit, allegeand as for Ã¾ame, That be Ã¾air law man suld be fred fra pane. VI Thair allegence Justice and Verite Affermit nocht; Ã¾airfor, befor Ã¾at king, Thai allegit for Ã¾ame rycht constantlye, That be thair law Adam and his offspring Eternalie suld be banist his rigne, God infinit becaus he had offende; Efter thair law his pane suld neuer end. VII Than Ã¾e Fader, all richtuis Lord, Gaif till his Sone to pas commandement, In thair debait be him to mak concord: And he richt sone schew him his sentement, Sayand: Ane deid sall mak you baith content, And bring Adam till peace with all his seid, That me will worship baith in word and deid. VIII Than God Ã¾e angell send in Ã¾e ciete Off Nazareth to Mary the virgin, Quhilk halsit hir with reverence and piete, Sayand: Haill, sueit angelicall Regin! God hes the chosin to be baith rute and ryn For mannis peace, for Ã¾ou a sone sall beir, Callit Jhesu, thairfor be nocht affeir. IX Fra scho contentit to beir Ã¾e Prince of Price, The Haly Gaist schane in hir tabernakill, Hes in hir spred Ã¾at riall flour-de-lice, Quhilk resauit ane man to reabill; But seid of man Ã¾is Virgin permanable The Sone of God consauit into haist Be subtell wirking of Ã¾e Haly Gaist. X Than but delay scho went vnto Ã¾e montane, Quhair duelling maid hir tender cousingnes, Apoun hir fute, thoucht scho had gret pane, Scho fen?eit nocht Ã¾at hevy way to pas. Hir first scho halsit, thoucht scho mar worthy wes, Syne with hir baid Ã¾e space of monethis thre, Hirself exersand in humilite. XI This worthy Lady, but mannis syne bur a child, Till angell glore, till synnar salvatour, Till feind a fa, a freind to saule exild, Till hungry meit, till thristy sweit licoure, Till blind Ã¾e sycht, to will a herbrour, Till dede Ã¾e life, till pure Ã¾e riche Lord, Till seik Ã¾e heill, till life scho bure concord. XII Efter aucht dais of his nativite He sched his blude in circumcisioun; For mannis saule thir arlis offerit he, Quhill he be his ded Ã¾e saule price laid doun. This fair ?oung Prince, of all our glore Ã¾e crown, Schew intill ded Ã¾at he his pepill lude, That for thair saik sa sone he sched his blude. XIII The Kingis thre he giddit be ane sterne Out of Ã¾e est, in haist to Bathelem; In Ã¾e stabill Ã¾ai fand the bony barne With his moder, in [Ã¾e] cribe allane. For his powerte, the kingis thocht na schame Till knell on kne, and him adore as king, As of gold, sens, mire, to mak offering. XIV In [till] the tempill his moder [did] him [bring], As wes Ã¾e Law that tyme intill Jowry, Off all Ã¾e warld thocht he wes Lord and King; Off dowis twa his offerand Ã¾an maid he. Auld Symeoun desirit for to de, Fra he had sene Ã¾at nobill Prince and King, Quhilk be his ded suld men fra torment bring. XV This gracius prince Herod trowit suld ringe Oure all Jowry, for Symeoun Ã¾e ald, The gentill licht till Iserall Ã¾e king, Had him before into Ã¾e tempill tauld. Thair he send his men of armes bald, In Bathelem all innocentis thai slew, For he Ã¾e Prince, quhilk king suld be, misknew. XVI Bot God him knew to rigne as maist worthy, Thairfor till Josaphe he ane angell send, Quhilk said in haist: Ã¾e barne tak and Mary, Syne with Ã¾aim baith in Egipt sone Ã¾ou wend. Thoucht he wes pure and littill had till spend, Without delay he wes obedient, [And vnto Egipt on his way he went.] XVII ?eris seven fra he had dwelling maid Intill Egipt, agane come Ã¾e angell, Sayand: Josaphe, se Ã¾ou, but mair abaid Pass to Ã¾i hame, Ã¾e land of Iserall: God hes me send agane, Ã¾e for to tell, That Ã¾ai ar ded quhilk wald Ã¾e barne haue slane. In Nazareth thus are Ã¾ai cumin agane. XVIII Mair of his life, vnto the twelft ?eir, The Ewangellis makis no mencioun[age]; Bot vthir said, Ã¾at with his moder deir In Nazareth he maid his hantage, Hir and Josaphe seruand in gret [homage], Thoucht Ã¾ai wer pure, and he a riche Lord; As Lendulphus and vtheris can record. XIX Fra of his age XII ?eris wer cumin, All to Ã¾e ciete in tyme of pasche Ã¾ai went; Thair wes he tynt, syne in the tempill fundin, Amang the doctouris halding argument: His moder said: Sueit Sone, thou hes ws schent; For we the soucht with gret dollour and pane, Bene neir our hame, syne turnit heir agane. XX Agane with Ã¾ame as subiet is he gane, Thoucht he wes Sone and Prince to God eterne, Makand his duelling intill ane sempill hame, Kenand Ã¾e man all prid for till disperne; Bot will Ã¾ow leir, Ã¾ou mone behald Ã¾e sterne, That schane sa lang in clud of his manheid, Or he exceid Ã¾e micht of his Godheid. XXI Neir thretty ?er fra [he] had maid duelling With his moder, as sempill seruitour, He thocht it tyme to schaw Lord and King, Send fra Ã¾e hevin the tynt man to recure; He tuke his leife, and to floun Jordane fure, Baptist wes thair, thocht he was cleyne of syn, Kenand all man with meiknes hevin to wyn. XXII In Ã¾e desert vnto Ã¾e fourty day But meit or drink he keipit abstinence; He hungerit syne to schaw him man werray; Him for to tempe Ã¾e feind did deligence; Bot his angellis keipit him in reuerence, Sarwand Ã¾at sweit rycht as Ã¾air awne souerane. He gat discipillis, syne ?eid in plane. XXIII Thoucht all my hare wer hertis for to think, And all my juntis sang with angellis stewin, And I mycht leif but sleip, meit or drink, Off Ã¾i panis I couth [nocht] schaw Ã¾e sevint, Quhilk Ã¾ou sustenit to bring me to Ã¾e Hevin, In cauld and hunger rynand throw slik and clay, Or thow tholit ded apoun Ã¾e gude friday. XXIV Thairfor I hald me bund till ignorance To tell Ã¾e teind of Ã¾i aduersite; Bot of [Ã¾i] life a gentill rememberance May mak mencioun Ã¾at in Ã¾ai ?eris thre, Quhilk thow prechit, schew ay sic cherite, That gud for ewill elik Ã¾ou wes doand, Raissand Ã¾e ded, Ã¾ai to slay Ã¾e seikand. XXV Syne [tyme] drew neir Ã¾at he wald offerand mak Off his body, for ws banist of blis; With Moses and Elias first he spak Intill Tabor, for Ã¾ai wer twa witnes That he wes Crist, hecht till al faderis, Quhilk in Ã¾e Lymbe lay, cryand day and nycht Up Ã¾e hevin, and cum doun lampe of lycht. XXVI Quhen his discipillis saw him schyne so brycht, Thai thoucht it gude ay to mak duelling Ã¾air; Bot quhen Ã¾ai herd Ã¾e woce cry, fra Ã¾e hicht, Thai fell on growfe, for dreid Ã¾ai frayit sair; He confort Ã¾ame, and bad Ã¾aim speik no mair Off Ã¾at visioun, quhill he raiss fra Ã¾e ded, Quhilk God deput for syne to be remeid. XXVII Efter lang pane, and lauber infinite, Hunger [and] thrist, [and] cauld in wynd and rane, Walking, wandering, powerte, gret dispite, Dolour, diseis, [and] cair cotidiane; Till all his sair he soucht na saw bot ane, The quhilk wes ded, as surcharge till his sorrow, That his manheid to de fra God couth borrow. FERIA QUARTA. TRADITIO DOMINI. XXVIII On Wedinday in hous of Caiphes Ã¾ai Gadderit princis and preistis of Ã¾e law, Him be sum meyn dissaitfully to sla. For of Ã¾e pepill Ã¾e preistis [had] gret aw Him to persew, for na rycht couth Ã¾ai schaw, Quhy he suld de; for quhy? he giddit sua, That na offence be did to freind nor faa. XXIX Judas, Ã¾at herd Ã¾at conspiracioun And fals counsall, wrocht rycht vnworthely, That him nocht warnit of ewil nacioun, Quhilk nycht and day him for to sla set spy. Bot he wes full of subtill tratory, Thairfor his lord for littill price he sauld, Put in thair will quhat thing gif him Ã¾ai wald. FERIA QUINTA. AD VESPERAS. XXX Peter and Johnne he send into ciete A place to grath, quhair be sulde eit Ã¾e lambe. To se this Prince it is ane greit piete Followand on fute as a pure sempill man. He said Ã¾e grace, and syne Ã¾e grace began Sayand: Ã¾e lambe till eit I thrist gretlye, Or I thole ded for man apoun Ã¾e tre. XXXI O man, behald Ã¾i Maker and Ã¾i King Off reuth [Ã¾e] rute and mirrour of meiknes, Quhilk to Ã¾e tratour maid sic cherising To gar him turne fra his dissaitfulnes; At set him at his tabill and his meiss, Syne wesche Ã¾air feit, Ã¾at ran to sched his blude, To gar men noit, how weill he Ã¾e saule lude. XXXII Knelland on kne, Ã¾air feit, claggit in clay, He wesche meikly as sempill seruitour. Peter thocht schame and said schortlie: Nay. Him arguun[i]t Jhesu our Saluitour. Peter said: Lord, I coumend me in ?our cure, Bait[h] heid and feit to wesche, gif ?e think speid. Crist said agane: Ã¾e feit hes all Ã¾e neid. XXXIII He [worth] richt sad and said: Of ?ou twelf ane Hes me betrasit and sauld dissaitfullie. That voce [of] hevin thirlis throu blude and bane, And ilk ane sperit: Serr, is Ã¾at nocht I? And Judas last, Ã¾at wrocht Ã¾e tratory. Thairfor our Lord directit his sermone Till him allane, Ã¾at wrocht had Ã¾e tresoun. XXXIV The sone of man, he said, mon pas to de, As in Ã¾e prophacy of him it is writtin. Bot wa is him, Ã¾at of wif born wes he, That is gilty of Ã¾at trespas or syn. Peter bad Johnne at Crist inquir of him Quha tratour wes, bot Crist him nocht revelit, Bot Sanct Johnne, quhilk fra Ã¾e laif conselit. XXXV The seramonis of Ã¾e ald testiament And vthir figouris tuke end, quhen he ordant His precius body till ws as sacrament In forme of breid, blissit with his hand. He said: Do Ã¾is my ded rememberand, Quhill I appeir in jugement agane, Gude till haue glore and ewill eternall pane. XXXVI In his sermond to lufe and cherite He Ã¾am exhortit, als to be pacient; Stifly to fecht aganis aduersite He confort Ã¾am, syn bad Ã¾aim be deligent, Keip his bidding and his commandement. He red Ã¾e grace, syne said: Lat ws pas hyne, For heir to duell it is na ganand tyme. IN THE FIRST COMPLYN. XXXVII In Ã¾e first complyn think with compassioun, How Ã¾at Ã¾e king panis to his deid, Furth to thole sa bitter passioun, Quhilk for thy self mycht neuer mair mak remeid; Thocht Ã¾at Ã¾i hert wer closit into leid, ?it wald it melt and gar Ã¾e watter spring Profound to think quhat desiris Ã¾i king. XXXVIII He passit furth vnto Ã¾e hill to pray, As he wes wont; syne his discipillis schew, At Ã¾at samin nycht Ã¾ai suld all pass him fra. Peter said: Lord, thocht Ã¾ai be all vntrew, ?it, or I suld sic tratoury persew, As presoner leuer de wald I. Crist said: Ã¾is nycht Ã¾ou sall me thrice deny. XXXIX Sedron he passit, syne enterit in Ã¾e ?ard; He bad Ã¾ame walk, for he to pray wald pas. Methink Ã¾is King had bot ane sempill gard, That ?eid to sleip, quhen he to battall wes. The feir of ded him put in sic distres, That he swet blud, for he knew perfitlie, That him behuffit to de richt cruelie. XL Thai sleippit thris, and thris he wesyit Ã¾aim; He bad [Ã¾aime] walk, for he to pray wald [gyn], Sayand: Be blith, for sone sall [end] ?our pane, Quhilk ?our fader directit hes, to bring The banist man agane hame to his ring. Till his discipillis he said: Lat ws ga, For he is neir, Ã¾at seikis me to slaa. XLI Judas said: Quhom Ã¾at ?e se me kiss, Hald him fast, and richt warly him leid. He halsit Crist, as a discipill of his, Bot with his hert he soucht him to Ã¾e ded. O God abone, in quhom begane Ã¾is feid, Maid nocht him Crist in his court cardinall? [Bo]t auerice wes into his hert ifall. XLII Thai laithly lippis vntit with fals tressoun, Kissit his mouth fer sueitar Ã¾an balm. That warijt wolf, wild, fra wit and ressoun, Passit to Ã¾e Lambe, quhilk maid him na demand, Bot with Ã¾at face mair sueiter Ã¾an Ã¾e lawn Sweitlie resauit Ã¾e sone of Lucifeir, Sayand: Freind, quhat maid Ã¾e cum heir? XLIII At Ã¾e Jowis he sperit, quhom Ã¾ai soucht. Thai said: We seik Jhesu [Ã¾e Nazareyne]. I am Jhesu, he said, Ã¾at all thing wrocht. Bot with Ã¾at woce Ã¾ai fell apoun Ã¾e greyne; For be vertu of his Godheid vnseyne, Vnder the claith of his huminite, Mycht nocht systeyne mannis fragilite. XLIV Quhen he Ã¾am fred to do quhat euir Ã¾ai wald, As seik vnthankfull to Ã¾e medicinar, With all Ã¾air mycht Ã¾ai schup him for to hald, Castand him doun, quhill his body wes sair. Quhen Peter saw, his hert wes full of cair; Thairfor to his kind king he wes boun; Fra Malcuss sone Ã¾e richt eir cutit doun. XLV Thai stren?eit Ã¾ai fair handis with a string, Quhill his fingeris, quhilk quhit wes, wox bla. Me think, Ã¾ai schew him sempill cherising For lang laubour, quhilk he couth for Ã¾ame ma. His appostilis all for dreid fled him fra, Left him allane full freindles in Ã¾e feild, With cruell men, quhilk handillit him full wild. XLVI Thai gart him ryn, thocht he wes neuer so tirit, Agane Ã¾e hill, quhill Ã¾at Ã¾ai maid him faynt. Intill his ded becauss Ã¾ai had consp[i]rit, Thai gart Ã¾am haist, for ony suld Ã¾aim taynt. I haue [nocht] wit Ã¾air wickitnes to paynt, For in Ã¾air deidis is sic Innormite, That [be] all meins Ã¾ai soucht to gar him de. AT MATYNNIS. XLVII Valk of Ã¾i sleip, o man, at matyn hour! With bitter teris remember, gif Ã¾ou may, The cruell panis, quhilk Crist, Ã¾i saluitour, The to redeme sustenis nycht and day. With hert forthink, syne with gret piete say: I am gret causs of all Ã¾e cruell pane. I staw Ã¾e frute, Ã¾ocht Ã¾ou restorit agane. XLVIII Annas houss wes first into Ã¾e gait; Thairfor Crist wes first till him present. Johnne enterit in, Peter stude at Ã¾e ?et; Off his discipillis and his document Annas sperit him richt deligent. Crist said agane: I techit into plane; The Jowis herd Ã¾air of, require at Ã¾aim. XLIX Fra on Ã¾is wise had said our Saluiour, Ane seruand of Ã¾e bischopis, Ã¾at wes by, Said: To Ã¾e bischop makes Ã¾ou sic ansueir? Als on Ã¾e cheik straik him vncurtasly. Crist said agane: Gif euer spokin haue I Off ewill, witness, and gif I [well] haue said, Quhy strikis Ã¾ou me, sen I na falt haue maid? L Now euery prince and lord of dignite, At Crist ?our king leir to haue pacience; Coumone meiknes in ?our nobillite, Revenge nocht ?our iniure nor offence. With pacience vse ?our mangnificence, Contemp all prid, gif ?e will cum to glore.â To Cayphas Ã¾ai gart him ga but moire. LI Peter for dreid of ded him thris denyit, Or Ã¾e cok thris renewit had his sange. Syne he ?eid furth a preva place and spyit, Quhair he grat and als handis wrange. To se Crist de the Jowis thoucht full lange; Thairfor witnes to him condampe Ã¾ai brocht, Bot Ã¾ai fand nane be law, Ã¾at him hurt moucht. LII Cayphas bad Ã¾at he suld ansser make Till Ã¾ai witnes, quhilk accusit swa. Crist held his town[g] and na thing till him spak; Cayphas said: Gife Ã¾ou be God werray, I coumand Ã¾e speik and als Ã¾e suth to say, Gif Ã¾ou be Crist, Ã¾e sone of God eterne. Crist said: I am, thocht Ã¾ou now me disperne. LIII ?e sall me se sitand on his rycht hand, Als as Juge cumand in jugement. Than Cayphas raif his claithis, sayand: He blasflemes, now quhat is ?our intent? Thai him condampnit to de with ane assent, Sayand he is gilty and be law suld de. How Ã¾ai him trettit, is gret piete to se. LIV Than but delay apoun [him] all Ã¾ai schot, Preiffand Ã¾air pith, quha fastest couth him sair. That Nobill Prince Ã¾ai defoulit vnder fute, Birsand his breist, rivand his tender haire. Sum on Ã¾e cheik, sum on Ã¾e wissage baire Spat in his face, filit his cristall eyne, And silit his sicht, as he a fule had bene. LV Thai hurt his [back] and all his body Ã¾ai fret, Saris his senonis and stoundis all his wanis, Pullit his berd, his tender heid Ã¾ai rat, Drowgis him down, sum persis him with panis; Thair ire as fire apoun his body ranis, Thai brist his breist, full wan Ã¾ai mak his face, Thir cruell panis Ã¾is lord will sla, allace. LVI O man, mair cruell, Ã¾an euer wes wild lioun, Quhilk with his pith ay purches him his pray, Ire is Ã¾air gid, feid flemes him fra ressoun, Will is Ã¾air law, inwy Ã¾ai mak sereff [ay]; Prid is Ã¾e prince, quhilk seikis him to sla, Cupid is king, quhilk him sa mait dois stand, Falset is faith, quhilk herd hankis his hand. LVII Man, be thou kind, quhom for this pane he dreis, Sorrow thy hert and all Ã¾i bowellis cerssis, And now behald, how purelie Ã¾at he deis; Lust birnis thy breist, pane all [his] pertis persis, His gret trublance with reuth Ã¾e mynd regressis Into Ã¾e tyme, as Ã¾ou had present bene Off all his passioun, and all his panis sene. AT PRIME. LVIII Vith pietius hert at prime Ã¾ou suld behald, How Ã¾ai Ã¾am dres for to condampe Ã¾e king, The cruell panis, quhilk befor is tauld, May Ã¾am nocht meiss, quhill Ã¾ai to ded him bring. Thai gadderit alsone as Ã¾e day couth spring; In thair counsail Ã¾ai gart him be present, For in his ded Ã¾ai wald agane consent. LIX Gif Ã¾ow be Crist, Ã¾ai said, ws schaw planly The sone of God, promitit Saluiour. Crist said: I am, as ?e haue tald trewly, Thoucht now I stand dispitit as a pure. The sone of man ?e sall se haue in cure To gife gude glore and ewill eternall pane, Cum in Ã¾e clude to jugement agane. LX Off witnes, quod Ã¾ai, we haue no neid, For we haue her of his mouth [blasfeming]. The king to bind without delay Ã¾ai speid, As of befor Ã¾ai had him hurt na thing. His fair handis Ã¾ai stren?eit with a string, And Ã¾us to Pilat Ã¾ai him bundin led, As be thair law he had seruit Ã¾e ded. LXI Na thing mycht cule Ã¾e hatrent of Ã¾air hert, Quhill be to de to Pilat wes present, Quhilk be Ã¾e law wes justice in Ã¾at art, In caus of blude to schaw Ã¾e sentement. Thai ?eid nocht in, bot Pilat furth he went, Sperit at Ã¾ame, gif ony causs Ã¾ai had, As bund to ded, as Ã¾ai him bundin had. LXII Fals occasioun richt reddely Ã¾ai fand, To gar him de Ã¾ai had sa gret fer[v]our. Than said Ã¾ai: We find him pervertand, Forbidand tribut to gife to Ã¾e empriour, Calland him king and Crist our Saluitour. Pilat said: Of ?our awne ?e haue lawis, Juge him thair by, for I trow nocht ?our sawis. LXIII Thai with ire ansuerit and said agane: It is nocht lauchfull, Ã¾at we ony slaa. Judas forthoucht and restorit agane The thretty pennyis, and syne a cord couth ta, Hangit himself, his [body] brist in twa, Tuke Ã¾e reuard of his iniquite, His avarice sa pervinst verite. LXIV With Ã¾ai pennyis Ã¾e preistis of Ã¾e law To berry pilgrames bocht ane sepultour. Na cherite nor piete gart Ã¾aim schaw, Bot gret malice gart Ã¾air hert indure, That Ã¾ai thocht euer be Ã¾ai pilgrames pure In strang landis Ã¾e fame for to gar fle, As fals propheit Ã¾ai had gart him de. LXV In Ã¾e tolbuth Pilat enterit in, Callit on Crist, and sperit, gif he wes king Crist ansuerit, inquirand first at him, Gif of himself or vthiris rehersing He sa inquirit, gif he as prince suld ring? Pilat ansuerit: I am na Jow to knaw, Thy awne pepill hes brocht Ã¾e to my law. LXVI Crist said: My kinrik into Ã¾is warld is nocht; Bot heir I come to schaw Ã¾e verite; As wardly king to regne, and I had thocht, My ministeris had maid debait for me, Quhilkis fra Ã¾e Jowis gret iniquite Had me defendit, and keipit fra Ã¾air handis, Thairfor to regne I come nocht in Ã¾ir landis. LXVII Pilat to Ã¾e Jowis ?eid agane, Sayand: Na causs I find to gar him de. The Jowis cryand, sayand, he suld be slane, For all Ã¾e pepill commouit now hes he, Till all Ã¾e land techeand of Jowry, Fra Galale, quhair Ã¾at he first began, To Ã¾is ciete, inquire at euery man. LXVIII Fra Pilat hard Ã¾am speik of Galale, To Herod sone he gart him be present, Trowand, be him he suld deliuerit be, For, as sum sayis, Ã¾at wes his entent. Bot Herod cled him in a quhit westiment, Als with his court maid at him derisioun, Send him agane to eik his confusioun. AT TERCE. LXIX Within Ã¾i mynd remember, man, at terce, How to Pilat Ã¾ai him brocht agane. His gret diseis with all hert reherss, His lang laubour, his pacience and his pane. Thai will nocht ceiss, quhill Ã¾at Ã¾ai se him slane, On him to luk Ã¾air stomok sair it stoundis. Thai cry his deth, quhill all Ã¾e tolboith soundis. LXX Off Ã¾e kindschip of Herod and Pilat Thai wer [no]cht blith; Ã¾airfor richt constantly Thai kest excuse Ã¾at nane condampnit him had; Than to Ã¾e pepill Pilat said in hy: As trespassour ?e follow him cruel[l]y; Bot I na causs can find him for to sla, I sall him scurge, gif Ã¾at content ?ow may. LXXI In feist of pasche Ã¾at tyme Ã¾e vse it wes To gif Ã¾e pepill ane condampnit man. That gart Pilat speir and furth to Ã¾am pas. Quhen Ã¾ai likit to haue Barrabam, Or Jhesu, king of Jowis callit Ã¾an. Thai cryit all: Tak him out of our sycht, And Barrabam gif ws now for our rycht. LXXII Pilat said: Quhat ewill hes he done? I haue him fund in all richt innocent. Thai cryit: Tollie away! take him sone! Crucifigy thai cryit with ane assent: Than Pilat thoucht, Ã¾e pepill to content, Him to scurge, quhill he Ã¾air passioun mesit. He wes begillit, na thing bot ded Ã¾aim plesit. LXXIII For Ã¾ai haue spul?eit [Ã¾o] Ã¾e heid all bair; Syne till ane pillar Ã¾ai full fast him band. The cruell panis, quhilk he sustenit Ã¾air, Be naturall wit may nane weill vnderstand. For as I writtin into Doctouris fand, He wes mair tender [into] his body, Than is Ã¾e scheyne into a mannis e. LXXIV Thairfor Ã¾ai say, Ã¾at he in his scurging Sufferit mair pane without comparisoun, Than sanct Laurence in tyme of his roisting Apoun Ã¾e fire with irne forkis downg doun. Fra heid to fute na part Ã¾ai levit soun. Off his body Ã¾e spirit for to confort Wes na remeid, bot ded, his pane to schort. LXXV That fair ?oung Prince, Ã¾e Sone of God etern, In manly natour Ã¾e prent of perfitnes, Off fairheid floure, Ã¾e rute of rute eterne, Veriour for man, the ground of all gudnes, With his fais is now met, allace, That be vneaiss mycht stand apoun Ã¾e ground, His fell woundis sa sair his hert can stound. LXXVI Thai handillit him richt [with] fellony; Syne skantlie cled into his awne clething Thai tirvit him agane richt cruelly Him till array and skorn, as he war king; The purpour claith abut his corps Ã¾ai thring, [Quhill] flesch and blude and claith togidder claife; His tender hid fra heid to fute Ã¾ai rife. LXXVII Apoun his heid Ã¾e crowne of thorn Ã¾ai [thrang] With sa gret preiss, quhill Ã¾ai his harnis persit. Fra Ã¾e [greit] pane [Ã¾at] all Ã¾e blude out [sprang] With all Ã¾air pith him for to pane Ã¾ai pressit. His gret meiknes na thing Ã¾air malice cessit, In till his hand a reid put for a ceptour; Thair for thy saik wes scornit our saluitour. LXXVIII His fair wissage Ã¾ai straik with ire agane, And on his face with gret dispit Ã¾ai spit. Thai take Ã¾e ceptour till renew his pane, With all Ã¾air mycht with it his heid Ã¾ai hit. Him for to pyne Ã¾ai think Ã¾ai haue na wit. Thairfor Pilat ?eid to Ã¾e Jowis and tald, As innocent Ã¾at he him furth bring wald. LXXIX O knycht, behald, how Ã¾i king furth is led, In new garmond arrayit reuthfully, Ceptour in hand, with croun of thorn on heid, In purpour cled, quhilk noyis him fellony. Fra Ã¾ai him se, as [tyte] Ã¾ai word Ã¾ai cry: Crucifige, apoun Ã¾e croce him bind! Bot Pilat said: Na [sin] in him I find. LXXX Efter our law, Ã¾ai said, Ã¾at he mon de, For he him callit Ã¾e sone of God eterne. Quhen he herd Ã¾ame, for feir mair dreidit he, And callit Jhesu befor him into derne, Said: Of Ã¾i stait to wit rycht fane I ?arne, Gif Ã¾ou be Sone of God Ã¾at all thing wrocht? Crist held his toung and till ansuerit nocht. LXXXI Pilat said: Thow speikis nocht to me? Wait Ã¾ou nocht, I haue Ã¾e in mi will To let Ã¾e pas or ?it to crucifye? Crist said agane: Wer nocht Ã¾at gevin Ã¾e till Fra God abone, quhilk knawis baith gud [and] ill, Thow had na mycht me for to pyne so sair; Thairfor Ã¾e syn of Judas is Ã¾e mair. LXXXII Fra Pilat saw Ã¾at he wes innocent, He soucht menis all way to let him ga. The Jowis said all with ane assent: Lat Ã¾ou him pas, Ã¾ou art Ã¾e kingis fa. He callis him king, Ã¾airfor Ã¾ou suld him slaa; For Ã¾at ryndis Ã¾i lordis maistie. Than Pilat dred him fra Ã¾e ded to fre. AT SEXT. LXXXIII O man, at sext luke with Ã¾i inwart sycht, How Ã¾ai Ã¾i Lord led to confusioun; Mak rowme to reuth, a place for piete dycht, Quhill Ã¾at Ã¾i hert haue perfit compassioun! His nychtlie pane, his daly dispectioun Thai euer refreschit with new torment gane; To eik his wo Ã¾e moir Ã¾ai leuch his pane. LXXXIV Pilat sitand in place of jugement, His wif till him sone send ane messinger, Quhilk bad him sone Ã¾at he suld nocht consent. Scho said: Ã¾is nycht I haue bene rycht affeir, Into Ã¾is nycht a visioun couth appeir Into my sleip; thairfor I trow he be Richt innocent of all iniquite. LXXXV To tholl Ã¾e dome of ded Ã¾ai brocht him out Into ane place, quhair Pilat held Ã¾e law. Than Ã¾e Jowis all cryit with a schowt To gar him de, als sone as Ã¾ai him saw. Thai think so lang, quhill Ã¾ai to ded him draw, That impacience compellit Ã¾ame to cry: Tollie, tollie him on Ã¾e croce! crucify! LXXXVI Pilat saw, he couth nocht cum gude speid Him to saif but tribulance of Ã¾e pepill, And of his office becauss he had sic dreid, Barabam he gart be gevin Ã¾am till; Jhesus scurgit deliuerit in thair will; Syne wesche his handis and callit him innocent, For in his ded he hes gevin na consent. LXXXVII O wod blindnes, the quhilk Ã¾at blind so maid The Jowis ene, Ã¾at ressoun put Ã¾aim fra. Thair blind inwy Ã¾air awne lawis gart faid, Quhilk Ã¾am forbad all innocentis to sla. Thai wrang Ã¾air freind to confort Ã¾air faa; Thai slay thair Lord, quhilk did riss fra pane, And loussit the theif quik to sla agane. LXXXVIII The purpour claith, quhilk clewit fast to his hid, With his awne blude Ã¾ai raif of him of force. His tender hid Ã¾ai brak fra bak to syd, Na part is haill of all his tender corss. Cled him agane, put on his bak a croce, Syne led him furth as condampnit to ded, Full bludy woundit baith fra fute till heid. LXXXIX His tender bak beris Ã¾at hevy [tre], Frettis Ã¾e flesche and birssis all his banis. Thoucht he be faynt, Ã¾ai haue na gret piete, Thai cruell men to rusche at him at anis. To confort him amang Ã¾aim neid [nane] is. To gar him ryn all deligence Ã¾ai ma; He is so mait, Ã¾ai may no forthir ga. XC Quhen he wes tyrit and mycht do no mair, He wald full fane haue refreschit his bak; He schupe to rest at a stane Ã¾at wes Ã¾air, Bot Ã¾ai wald nocht Ã¾at he suld tary mak; Thairfor Symeoun Ã¾ai compellit to tak His croce to beir Ã¾at Ã¾ai mycht fast him leid, To Mont Calwary to put him to Ã¾e ded. XCI Mony followit of diuerss nacioun, Quhilk to Ã¾e ciete come in tyme of pasche; Sum makand scorne, sum dirisioun, Sum drawand him, sum spitand in his face. To se Ã¾is prince it wes a piete, allace; On euery side sustene fell torment, Syne fra all syn beand so innocent. XCII To Ã¾e wemen, Ã¾at maid sa hie a mene, He turnit him and schew Ã¾e prophecy, How Ã¾at Ã¾e ciete of Jerusalem Suld be distroyit for Ã¾e innoirmate. Said: Dochteris of Jerusalem, let be! Gret nocht on me, bot on ?ow and ?our seid, Gret and mak cair for Ã¾is rycht cruell de[i]d. XCIII For the day sall cum Ã¾at ?e sall say: Wemen ar blist Ã¾at na barnis beris. ?e sall se hillis fall and hid in wa, Quhill Ã¾e Romanis haue cessit fra Ã¾air weris. Thir cruell panis our hertis full fell deris, For gif but causs Crist wes slane cruelly, O Lord, quhat sall worth of ws, Ã¾at ar gilty? XCIV Thai saw in ded compleit Ã¾is prophacy The twa and fourty ?er efter his passioun; For quhen Ã¾e Romanis segit Ã¾e ciete, The wemen eit Ã¾air barnis in Ã¾e toun. Jerusalem wes brint and castin doun, Ten hundreth thousand of Ã¾e Jowis slane, Nyne thousand and sevin led quik with Ã¾ame. XCV And as Crist wes for thretty pennyis sauld, Quhilk all Ã¾e warld redemit with his [deid], Sa thretty Jowis wer for a penny tauld, The Romanis [wer sa irkit Ã¾am to leid]. Sa Ã¾us endit Ã¾e malice and Ã¾e feid Aganis Crist, quhilk [Ã¾ai] held saikleslie; Thairfor be wair and leif in cherite! XCVI Twa thewis with him to Ã¾e ded Ã¾ai led To Mont Calwary, as he gilty had bene; Bitter wyne myxt with gall Ã¾ai had, That Ã¾ai him gaif to slokin his thristing. He taist it and put it fra him syne, Drank nocht of it, Ã¾ai him disrayit agane To mydouris, maid him eikit in pane. XCVII Quhen Ã¾ai his clething tuke fra him agane, Thai drew Ã¾e bluide fra all his precius woundis. Fra heid to fute now all is bot in pane, For of his flesche Ã¾air is na place Ã¾at sound is. His blissit body, his nobill hert throw stoundis; Wald ded now tak him, he come now into tyme Him for to louss fra his gret wa and pyne. XCVIII O pyne, vnkind quhy art Ã¾ow mair till him Than ony knycht Ã¾ou had befor in hand? To breik the law [Ã¾ow] suld at him begyn, Quhilk be trespas is subiect to Ã¾i wand: Thow art nocht just, [and] Ã¾i law can nocht stand, For thow hes grace oftyme to synneris sent, And of his wa thow will nocht mak an end. XCIX Apoune Ã¾e croce all nakit Ã¾ai him [kest], With sa gret force, quhill Ã¾ai neir hand him sla; With irne nalis, quhen Ã¾ai in strik sa fest Throw Ã¾e handis, Ã¾an he begouth to pray, Sayand: Fader, na vengence on Ã¾ame ta, Bot for my saik for?et Ã¾air cruelte, For Ã¾ame blindis Ã¾air gret iniquite. C On lenth and breid with scharpe cordis Ã¾ai tak That nobill corps, quhill Ã¾ai Ã¾e banis twyn; Now all the lethis on his tender bak Thai sa depart, quhill Ã¾at his ene wox dyme; Fra heid to fute Ã¾ai brak [baith hid] and ryme, Twynnis his joyntouris, and rivis all his banis, Birssis his breist, and all his bowellis panis. CI Mony panis he tholit of befor, Bot to Ã¾is pane is na pane to be peir; Now he is mait, now he may do no mair, Now flesch [and] blude and banis is all on steir; Now Dede fra pane hes tane him presoneir, Quhilkis him handillis full fair in every part, Fra heid to fute him persis with a dart. CII O man, now luke how deir is Ã¾i ransoun, How he is pvnist for Ã¾e, Ã¾at did na myss; Thrist in Ã¾i hert his bitter passioun, Murnyng in mynd, for Ã¾ou art causs of Ã¾is! Say: Lord, my syn and Ã¾i gret lufe, iwiss, Garis Ã¾e now ly stentit on Ã¾e tre: I did Ã¾e miss, Lord, haue mercy on me! CIII Quhen Ã¾ai had drawin his handis and his feit On lenth and breid, to mak his body lang, To Ã¾e boris Ã¾ai maid his body meit; Syne with gret force Ã¾e nalis throw Ã¾ai dang. Fra handis and feit Ã¾e precius blud out ran So plentiusly, quhill it his body wet, Syne Ã¾ai Ã¾e croce apoune Ã¾e end it set. CIV O man, on kne before Ã¾e tre Ã¾ou kneill, With hert and e luke to Ã¾e tre and say: Quha the so hie hes [tane] fro me my sell? All game and gle is gane fra me away. Wa will me sla throw dollour or my day; I may nocht luke bot Ã¾ow abone me draw To kiss Ã¾i feit with blude all wet ouraw. CV O my kind King, of Ã¾is parting, allace, Fra me all thing of conforting is tane. O I biiding of all helping so naice May seik and sing as dulfull dring allane. Haist for to bring me into Ã¾i rigne sone hame; For se I Ã¾e hing on Ã¾e tre me fro, Deith with his dart will smyt my hert in two. CVI Ane trespassour Ã¾ai put on every hand, As he had beyne parttaker with Ã¾air cryme. Now is compleit Ã¾e prophacy, sayand: With ewill men he is deput to pyne. Thai his clething partis with cuttis syne, As Ã¾e propheit lang tyme [befoir] had said: My claithis ar partit and Ã¾aim cuttis laid. CVII Pilat wrait Ã¾e titill abone his heid: Jhesu of Nazareth, of Ã¾e Jowis king. Syne on Ã¾e croce stak it vp abone his heid, Writtin in Greik, Ebrew, and Latyn. This till reid [came] mony, baith ald and ?ing, Off Ã¾e Jowis, for neir Ã¾e ciete wes Mont Calwary, quhair he to ded couth pas. CVIII Thairat Ã¾e Jowis gret inwy Ã¾ai had; Thairfor Ã¾ai said: Writ nocht: King am I, Bot writ Ã¾at he king of Jowis him maid. Pilat ansuerit and said to Ã¾ame in hy: That I haue writtin [I] may nocht deny. He said full trew, for sa behuffis to be, For he be law wes king of all Jowre. CIX Thoucht Pilat vnderstud nocht quhat he wrait, He coumendit Cristis nobillite. Calland him king, he extollit his stait, For till his crowne all kingis moist sudiet be, And euery man in his realme crownis he, Predestinat quhilk is to hevinn[i]s blis, For be his ded our realme restorit is. CX Jhesu in oure leid is callit saluitour, And Ã¾at may weill be applyit to him; For Ã¾e manly natour he tuke in cure, Quhilk to Ã¾e ded wes neuer woundit be syn. The joy Ã¾ay tyne agane [he] gart Ã¾aim wyn, The quhilk [Ã¾e] scheip on his bak brocht hame, Thairfor Jhesu we will call his name. CXI As Nazareth in Inglis toung is to say As ?outh, fairheid, innocence or new, Quhilk till ony king apply we may, That wes Ã¾e floure quhilk fra Ã¾e Jesse grew, His haly life his gret pacience schew, That Nazareth full weill till him mycht gane, That did no myss and bure Ã¾e hevy pane. CXII Four kind of folk we fand Ã¾at scornit him, Off quhom sum ?eid, sum stude, [sum sat], sum hang, Quhilk betaikinnis folk in four kind of syn, That nycht and day euer to Crist dois wrang. And him blasfemes Ã¾air gret synnis amang, Als [his] sueit name in ded Ã¾ai euer deny, Doand Ã¾air cure him new to crucify. CXIII The first Ã¾at scornit Crist into his ded, Wes Ã¾e pepill, Ã¾at Ã¾e croce passit by. Thir folk for scorne apoun him schuk Ã¾air heid, Sayand: On the and all Ã¾i doctryne fyne Thow said: Ã¾is tempill I sall distroy in hy, And ane vthir in dais thre vp bring. Now help thy self, gif Ã¾ou be Crist our king! CXIV Thir men Ã¾at gais ar men of covatice, Quhilk in this warld wanderis nycht and day. For ewill wynnyng Ã¾air followis syn and vice, As of Ã¾is warld Ã¾ai neuer suld pas away. The moir Ã¾ai haue, Ã¾e more Ã¾ai covat ay; Thai ryn in syn, as Ã¾ai wald Crist blasfeme; With avarice sa filit is thair eyne. CXV The secound folk Ã¾at scornit Crist our king, Wes Ã¾e scribis into the law perfite, With Ã¾am auld men quhilk in gouernyng All Ã¾e pepill of Ã¾e tempill at And Ã¾e bischoppis, quhilk had at him dispit; Thir folk stude vpe and for scorne cryit him till: He traistis in God, help [he] him, gif he will. CXVI Thir folk Ã¾at standis, ar lik men of pride, Quhilkis standis stif be inobedience, Als lukis vp be ambicioun all tyid; To clyme abone is all Ã¾air deligence. In Ã¾air power is all Ã¾air confidence, Throu hicht and prid Ã¾ai trow Ã¾e hevin to clyme, Bot Lucifer thair ressoun makis dyme. CXVII The thrid [Ã¾]at sat, wes Ã¾ai cruell knychtis, The quhilk at Crist maid gret derisioun. Thouch he wes God, he wald nocht schaw his mychtis, He is man, for man wald thoill passioun. Thairfor, throu malice and indiscrecioun, Thai scornit him in his mortalite, Trowand him nocht Ã¾e Sone of God to be. CXVIII Thir folk [Ã¾]at sat betaikinnis cruell men, Quhilk Ã¾e body haldis into eis; Thair fleschely lust garris Ã¾aim Crist mysken, Thair cruell will fer mair Ã¾an God Ã¾ai pleis, To sit euer [soft] and ly without diseis. In all thair tyme to nuriss Ã¾e carioun, Heir to tholl pane Ã¾ai think it no ressoun. CXIX Crist and [Ã¾e] Sanctis Ã¾ir folk scornis all way, Quhilk wan Ã¾e hevin with mekill wa and pane. In cald, hunger, walkand nycht and day, To by that joy with all sorrow war fane. T[h]ocht sum wer heidit, sum stanit, and sum slane, Thai thocht all sueit with hevinly [bliss] to wyn, Thair for may nane but pane Ã¾at place cum in. CXX The fourt blasfemit Crist wes Ã¾e theife, Quhilk on Ã¾e croce hiang on his left hand. He said to Crist with impacience and greif: Gif Ã¾ou be king quhilk rigne in Ã¾is land, Be to Ã¾i self and als till ws warand. The tothir theif him repentit and said: We serue oure ded, Ã¾ocht he na falt haue maid. CXXI This crabbit theif, Ã¾at hang on his rycht hand, Quhilk but prophacy expletit his pennance Betakinnis men, quhilk euer mair is murnand, The saynd of God ay reput myschance. Tha murne euer be Ã¾ai in trublance. Be impacience Ã¾air merit quyt Ã¾ai tyn And mynnis na thing of all thair pyne. CXXII To Ã¾e gude theif our Lord said: Ã¾ou sal be This samin day with me in paradice. Till his moder a sone deliuerit he, A power seruand for Ã¾e gret Prince of Price. Sche him as sone resauit in seruice, He hir as moder and lady tuke in cure Fra Ã¾at tyme furth, quhill his life can dure. CXXIII Now dollouris on euer ilk ane syid In departing of Ã¾ir tender freindis, Quhile lufe, quhile pane wirkis Ã¾aim woundis wid, And ay ilkane full sair for vthir menis. Now pane, now wo, all confort fra Ã¾aim flemes; Sair garris Ã¾ame grane, all throu Ã¾e hert Ã¾aim thirlis, Quhile wo, quhile dule Ã¾is part to Ã¾aim now trublis. CXXIV Fra Crist our king, quhilk is Ã¾e lampe of lycht, Inclynit him Ã¾e spirit till expire, Phebus for wo to luke [on] had nocht mycht, Bot drew abak his bemes in his ire; Fra twelf till thre he let no thing espire; As he wald say: I sall revengit be Apoun Ã¾e man quhilk garris his maker de. CXXV Quhen none drew neir, he cryit twiss: Ely! Sayand: Fader, quhy hes thou left me sa? Thou lettis me pyne, and efter confort cry, Sa Ã¾at Ã¾e Jowis haldis me for Ã¾i fa; To Ã¾i Marteris Ã¾ou sendis confort in wa, Till me, Ã¾i sone, Ã¾ou sendis no remeid, Bot in my wo refreschis me with ded. CXXVI O voce of reuth! O voce of maist dollour, Off lamentatioun and greit piete! Off all Ã¾e warld [Ã¾e] generall Salviour But ony help now deis on Ã¾e tre! Cry what he will, he gettis na suppley; For God him puttis in Ã¾e will of man, And man wait nocht how torment he him can. CXXVII Quhen Jhesu saw his torment draw to end, And weill now neir compleitit Ã¾e prophecy, He said: Sitio, Ã¾at is to thrist, I spend For mannis saule my saule and my body. Moir causis me Ã¾i lufe and na pane to cry; Thame to redeme I haue sa gret desire, That lufe and pane my hert birnis in a fire. CXXVIII Quhen Ã¾at wes by herd, Ã¾at of thrist he spak, Rynand in haist tuke ane reid Ã¾at wes tvme, Syne a spowng fast apon it stak, Als intill wynakar Ã¾ai soupit it full sone. Syne till Jhesu Ã¾ai raikit it abone, Sayand: Now Crist, mak for Ã¾i self remeid, Cum of Ã¾e croce and saife Ã¾e fra Ã¾e ded. CXXIX Fra he tuke, he wald nocht drink of it, Bot taistit it and put it fra him syne, Sayand: All thing in me is consumyt, Quhilk I suld thole Ã¾e man to lose fra pyne. In cald and hunger I have spendit my tyme, To gar Ã¾e man me lufe as souerane, And for my luf I get no thing bot pane. AT NONE. CXXX O Man, at none [Ã¾ou] with mynd behald The well of lufe, throu droucht quhilk is gane dry! His eyne wox dym, his flesche wox stif and cald, For all Ã¾e blude is ronn fra his body. In euery part ded can his palice spy Him for to reist within a littill [space], Syne with his dart him for [to] sla, allace. CXXXI Quhen ded enterit within Ã¾e breist of blis, His nobill hert he graipit in his hand, Sayand: O King, [thocht] ?e haue done no myss, For ?our pepill ?e mone bow till our wand; For ?our Fader hes gart ws vnderstand, That be ?our ded man is restorit to grace; Bot Ã¾e, saikles, I dred to sla, allace! CXXXII O! he full blyth obeyit to Ã¾e ded, For saik of man he in his armes braist; Syne on his breist he inclynit his heid; As he wald say, now man I gif Ã¾e gaist! He thocht full lang Ã¾e bitter ded till taist, For mannis saule, [Ã¾e] quhilk man hes maid [lasche] Off hevinnis blis, quhilk [gart] him cry: Allace! CXXXIII With ane gret voce cryit our Salviour, Sayand: Fader, I coumend [me] in Ã¾i handis; My pvnist spreit now tak into Ã¾i cure, Quhilk Ded hankis herd in his bandis; Wait none my wo, bot Ã¾ou Ã¾at vnderstandis. And Ã¾is sayand, he incly[nit] his face, Syne with gret pane he gaif the gaist, allace! CXXXIV And fra my hert wald bludy teris spring, For thy passioun to murne baith day and nycht; My wofull mynd it wald to confort bring; Off all solace Ã¾ou had tynt Ã¾e sycht: And I sal be besy with all my mycht, And sall nocht ceiss to cry, quhill I worth hais, For my kind Kingis ded to say: Allace! CXXXV O cruell Ded, with Ã¾e I think to flite, Quhilk me hes rewit all my conforting. Allace! my hert is now sowpit in site, For be Ã¾e, Ded, it happinnit Ã¾is parting; Thow art vnricht as Justice for to ring, The Sone of God in to Ã¾i handis Ã¾ou brace Fra me pure knycht, to sla my Lord, allace! CXXXVI O cruell Ded, so bald how durst Ã¾ow be, To put handis in him Ã¾at aucht Ã¾e nocht? Speik, gif Ã¾ow dar! and mak ansuer to me, Thow foull of reif, to end Ã¾at has him brocht: He synnit neuer in word, ded, nor thocht! But cryme to de, it is ane hevy cais, Thow hes him slane Ã¾airfor but law, allace. CXXXVII And in Ã¾i hert reuth had ony rovme. The lang lauboure and pane [it] mycht haue [eisit], Quhilk sustenit this King of gret renoun, Syne his godheid no man in luff applesit, He had sic pane, thocht it him nocht displesit, That all his life to Ã¾e wes bot a raiss, And his confort is now ded, allace. CXXXVIII Into Ã¾i band as bond Ã¾ou had him bund, Quhen in Ã¾e ?ard be enterit for to pray. His fair body with blude wes all ourerun, The ded of him put Ã¾e in sic affray: His discipillis Ã¾ou gart fle him fra. Syne Ã¾ai knychtis him dang, quhill he was haiss, Thir panis cruell neir hand him slew, allace. CXXXIX Quhen Ã¾ou saw, Ã¾at he wes cleyne of syn, And be iustice exempit fra Ã¾e law, Fals witnes Ã¾ou socht to challange him, Sum causs of ded aganis him to schaw. Thai band him sair, quhill his fingeris wer haw, With stoundis scharpe put fra him all solace, The croune of thorne thirlis his heid, allace. CXL The purpour claithis, quhilk claif fast till his hide, With his awne blude Ã¾ai raifeit fra him on force. His tender flesche Ã¾ai brak fra bak to syid, Na part wes haill of all his tender corss, Cled him agane, put on his bak a cross, With twa thewis to ded syne gart him pas; His fais leuch, his freindis said: Allace. CXLI Apoune Ã¾e croce all nakit Ã¾ai him hang With sa gret force, quhill Ã¾ai neir him slew; To Ã¾e boris his armes wes nocht lange, Thairfor with cordis Ã¾ai his body drew. Fra heid to fute Ã¾ai all his panis renew, To twyn his wanis wes [Ã¾air] besynes, Syne my kind King to sla me fra, allace. CXLII My gle is gone, renewit is my wo, My spreit is spicit with malancolie. Ded I defy, for he may do no mo; For all confort now hes he tane fra me. My lufe, my life he hes slane on Ã¾e tre; And I for dule neir deis in Ã¾is place, For sueit Jhesu is ded fra me, allace. CXLIII Quhen God, maker of euery creatour, Wes slane for man, quhom he maist nobill maid, The wale full sone [haly] intwa it schure, For of his ded it mycht nocht bid Ã¾e braid. Als on this wise he to Ã¾e Jowis said, That of Ã¾e figour wes drawin Ã¾e courting, Quhilk Crist oure King betaikinnis to thole pyne. CXLIV The erd trymbillit, Ã¾e craggis raif in schundir, Grawis oppinnit for dollour and piete. Senturio and his knychtis had woundir, With sic a woce sa sone Ã¾at he suld de. He trowit syne and all his cumpany, Sayand: For suth, Ã¾e Sone of God he wes, And vthir by for ded sone can pas. CXLV Quhen Ã¾e pepill wes all passit away, His awne moder the croce remanit by, With Madaleyn and Salame alsua, Eik with Sanct Johnne and Mary Jacoby, With vthir ma into Ã¾air cumpany, Quhilk followit him rycht as Ã¾air awne Souerane, Deand for dule of his gret wo and pane. CXLVI Allace, quhat pane had Ã¾is sueit virgin, Quhen scho hir sone saw de apon Ã¾e tre! His cruell ded hir put in sa gret pyne, On ground to stand Ã¾at sche had na powstie. Had ded hir tane, he had schawin cherite. The swerd of dule sa sair hir hert can brace, Quhilk for his sone hir pynit in Ã¾at place. CXLVII With e and hert scho lukit to Ã¾e tre, For hir sueit sone all boldin into pane. Scho said: O croce, I will compleyne on the, Quhilk but justice my sone Jhesu hes slane. The frute Ã¾ou beris be law is nocht Ã¾i awne, For fra Ã¾e rute wes neuer sic frute Ã¾at grew, The Haly Gaist it in my body sew. CXLVIII The frute, Ã¾e quhilk I cleyne virgin bure but syn, Fra ald Adame and all lawis wes fre. He staw Ã¾e frute, and God commandit him With all his seid for Ã¾at trespas to de. I bair Ã¾e frute, keipand virginite; Thairfor be law to Adam he aucht nocht, Quhilk neuer synnit in word, dede, nor thocht. CXLIX To wile personis sen Ã¾at Ã¾ow hes bene Justice, Quhilk ewill lif wes haldin euer infamit, For to ressaue Ã¾e nobill Prince of Price, Quhilk neuer did myss, me think Ã¾ou suld be eschamit. To haue said nay, nane mycht Ã¾e [haue] blamit, For he is lord of life be wera law, Thairfor to ded obedience nane he aw. CL Quhat wes Ã¾e caus of Ã¾in iniquite, Just men and ewill to mak elik in pane? With strif iquit now lufe and cherite, Schame for honour he hes gottin agane. He procurit lif to him, Ã¾at hes him slane, And thou of ded Ã¾e minister he[s] bene, Quhilk is Goddis Sone, put twa thevis [hes] betwene. RESPONSIO CRUCIS. CLI To Ã¾e I say, o Lady Virgine cleyne, Off my worschip Ã¾ou art baith crop and rute, Thoucht I wes wile, throu flewour now I schyne, The frute of the richt mychty garris me mute. I lay full law, bot now I stand on fute, Fresche flurisand with frute of sic a kyn. Quhilk to ded men is werray medicyne. CLII O Lady sueit, Ã¾e birding I beir now, The nobill frute I haue in possessioun, It is borne to Ã¾e warld and nocht to ?ow, To be suppley of every nacioun. With ded to sla ?oure sone had na ressoun, He disponit for mannis saik to de, That throu his ded [he] mycht restorit be. CLIII O Hevinly Queyne, Ã¾e nobill Prince of Price, He set me croce agane, yt hote Ã¾e tre. Quhilk God abone plantit in paradice, Throw quhilk men fell in gret perplexite, Thocht he saw nocht, he restorit [is] be me, Frethand Ã¾e man, Ã¾at had nocht to lay doun, Quhill Ã¾at my frute is sauld for his ransoun. CLIV Lif fell in dede for luf of ald Adam, And throu my frute ded is restorit to live; Be my sueit frute bitter dede is slane, Thairfor, Lady, Ã¾is ded suld mak ?ow blyth. I am Ã¾e first daystern Ã¾at gart kith To Ã¾e fadi[ri]s, Ã¾at lay into Ã¾e lymbe In gret mirknes be ald Adames syn.

That gart Ã¾e Jowis sone to Pilat pas, Quhilk him besocht, his knychtis to let ga To Mont Calwary Ã¾e pynit men to sla. Than Pilat said, Ã¾ai suld thair theis breik, Syne but delay of Ã¾e croce Ã¾ame tak. CLVIII Thai cruell men obeyit with desire, Raddy to schaw Ã¾air gret crudilite. To Mont Calwary Ã¾ai come birnand in ire; Bot fra Ã¾ai saw Ã¾ai twa thevis nocht de, Thai brak thair theis, syne tuke Ã¾aim of Ã¾e tre, Kest Ã¾air carionis in a place neir by, Syne till our King Ã¾ai schupe Ã¾aim cruelly. CLIX Bot fra Ã¾ai saw Ã¾at cristynnit Kingis face All wan and paill, eik closit wes his sycht, His bludy body stif in euery place, Thai estemit Ã¾at ded had done his rycht. Throw Ã¾e richt syd him woundit a blind knycht With a scharp speir, quhill blude and watter cleir Agane natour his ded hert woundit [sair]. CLX The precius blud ran vnto Longeus hand, And he his eyne anoyntit with it throu caiss; Off [Ã¾e] tuiching of God sic grace he fand, With e and hert Ã¾at he knew Cristis face: He left his office, resignit in Ã¾at place, Als levit lang in relyiosite. Syne bischope maid and marter deit he. AT EWINSANG. CLXI [W]ith reuthfull hert remember at evinsang With cruell dede quhilk deit hes Ã¾i king. Behald quhat pane, quhat tyme, quhat place [he] hang, He hes tholit to bring Ã¾e to his ring; And Ã¾uhat pane and pyne dreit hes Ã¾is ding, Is for Ã¾i saik, be nocht Ã¾airfor vnkind, Bot nycht and day his dede call in Ã¾i mynd. CLXII Efter Ã¾at deid as bond Ã¾is knycht had tane, And of evinsang Ã¾e tyme approchit neir, Ane gret noble, quhilk Joseph hecht to name, Come fra Ã¾e court Christ for till inquyre. In Ã¾air dedis he was not counsalyre, For to Jesu he lang discipill wes, Thairfor but dreid he thocht to Pilat pas. CLXIII This nobill schew his [greit] nobilite, For he was first quhilk honorit Ã¾is king. Churlis him slew and scurgit him cruelle, Quhilkis in Ã¾e toun wes haldin maist indigne. His nobill hart gert sa gret piete spring, That lyfe and deid he comptit not a haw, So purlie hing quhen he his maister saw. CLXIV All dreid of deid full sone he set on syde And constantlie to Pilat enterit he, Askit Ã¾at corps all bludy in Ã¾at tyde, With gret reuerence Ã¾at it mycht beryit be. Fra Pylat herd Ã¾at Ã¾ai war deid all thre, Without delay he informit his will, And gert Ã¾e corps of Christ be gevin him till. CLXV Ane pretius claith, quhilk we ane syndon call, That kingly corps to couer he coft syne; To wirschip him he set his study all; Oft on Ã¾e croce he thocht gret dreid to ryn. He wald not cum doun, quhill he doun mycht wyn, Bot him causit instant necessite To clym abone and louss him of Ã¾e tre. CLXVI Nichodemus, quhilk come apon Ã¾e nycht, Richt sacretlie to se oure saluiour, Throu Christis blude of faith gat sic a lycht, That his deid corps till oynt be tuke in cure; Of diuerss spicis a sindry mixtour Fra corruptioun his body till inbalme; Syn to Ã¾e croce Ã¾ai come baith but [dwalm]. CLXVII Syne to Ã¾e croce a lang ledder Ã¾ai june Of Ã¾at hurde to lowss Ã¾e lokis strang. Syne on Ã¾e ledder Joseph clame abone, Fra hand to fute Ã¾e nalis out Ã¾ai dang; That hevinlie hurde syne in armis he thrang, He come doun richer, Ã¾an quhen he vp ascendit, Be all Ã¾e gold Ã¾at he had on him spendit. CLXVIII Than his moder him in hir armis claucht, To price his pane neir by Ã¾e croce sat doun, Quhyle with Ã¾e Jowis, quhile with Ã¾e deid scho faucht. His bludy corps sa sair hir hert gart [w]ound. Bot quhen sche saw Ã¾at neuer a part wes soun Of his body, sche cryit reuthfully: Now Ã¾ou art deid; Ã¾airfor full way is me. CLXIX Quhen Ã¾at sueit thing beheld his tender hyde In euery part brokin with scurgis scharpe, Als heid and fute, Ã¾e wound of his rycht syde, The swerd of dule persit hir tender harte. Mirth fled fra hame, cair maid his cave invart, Thrang throw hir hert, quhill sche said petiuslie: My sone is deid, Ã¾erfor full way is me. CLXX His bludy corps in hir armis scho thrang, About hir hals syne laid his armis tua. O Deid, sche said, quhy hes Ã¾ou done Ã¾is wrang, To let me leif, sen he is deid me fra? Off all Ã¾is warld I wait nathing bot wa; My panis supprice, for doloure neir I de, My sone is deid, Ã¾airfor full way is me. CLXXI His fair vissage all barkit our with blude, With greit fer[u]our scho junit to hir face; Baith mouth and chyn to kiss scho thocht full gude, Off dedlie wo scho forgit hir solace. [Scho] couth nocht ceiss Ã¾at blissit corps to brace, Thoucht bludy teris le[ttid] hir to se. For hir sueit sone scho said: Full wa is me. CLXXII Scho said: Sweit sone, Ã¾i cristall eyne ar dyme, Thy lufsum lippis with ded ar maid full bla, Thy teth is haw, changit cheik and chyne, Thy toung is clung, Ã¾ou may nocht speik nor na, Thy feit is sair, Ã¾ou may nocht stand nor ga; The scurgis scharp hes rewin baith body and the, Now art Ã¾ow ded, Ã¾airfor full wa is me. CLXXIII Jerusalem, Ã¾ou ceiss[is] nocht of Ã¾i syn, Nane sall resist to Ã¾i transgressioun; Now is he dede, quhilk wes wont oft to ryn Throu all Jowry, transgressouris for to confound. Bot of his woce now decressit is Ã¾e sound. Thy fals lawis nocht reformit be, For Ã¾i doctour is ded, full wa is me. CLXXIV Thoucht his moder maid lamentacioun, And for his ded murnit rycht pietuouslie, That naturall greif wes subiect to ressoun, Quhilk giddit ay to natur[al]ite. Agane ressoun faucht ay sensualite, Quhilk gart him murne baith in ded and thocht, Bot ressoun this greife offendit nocht. AT CUMPLIN TYME. CLXXV Man, at complyn behald Ã¾at hevinly king, Apoun his bak he did ly on suppyne; Off his marcy beseik him to bring Out of Ã¾is warld prolixit Ã¾at in pyne, Eternaly to ring in glor divyne With him thy Lord, quhilk with Ã¾e bocht Ã¾at blis With cruell ded, ?e thoch he did no myss. CLXXVI Thir twa knychtis with ded and deligence Thair kingis corps spicit richely; In syndoun claith him wand with reuerence, And as Ã¾e vse of Ã¾at into Jowry, The gret lordis and men of dignite Off precius spice to mak a conspectioun Flesche of ded men to keip fra corrupcioun. CLXXVII Besid Ã¾e place, quh[ai]r he wes crucifyit, In till ane ?ard, Ã¾air wes ane sepilltur, Out of ane crag carwit rycht perfitly, Now vnwsit with ony creatour. That hevinly hurd Ã¾air but delay Ã¾ai bure, For skant of tyme Ã¾ai mycht nocht mak duelling, Half as Ã¾ai wald, for to beheld Ã¾air king. CLXXVIII That hevinly hurd, of God Ã¾e tabernakill, As mortall man to bery Ã¾ai Ã¾ame boun, Vnder Ã¾e cure of dedis dirk vmbrakill To duell a quhille richt law is now laid doun. This nobill Prince, of all our glore Ã¾e croun, Quhilk be justice suld sit in trone to rigne, Now vnder fute into ane coif Ã¾ai thring. CLXXIX Into Ã¾e coife quhen Ã¾is ded knycht [Ã¾ai] brocht To berry it, befor him Ã¾ai murnit all; Thocht he wes ded, ?it sum confort Ã¾ai thocht With e to se Ã¾at corps defit all, Bot his moder, Virgin Angelicall, That Ã¾at parting of ded bure neir Ã¾e braid, Quhen scho Ã¾e graif saw with a stane cloiss laid. CLXXX Off his keiping Joseph had gret cure, Thairfor ane stane, Ã¾at wes baith gret and lang, Fra best and man to cloiss Ã¾e sepultur, With richt gret force befor Ã¾e graif Ã¾ai thrang. At his moder syne askit leif to gang Till herbry, for him nerit Ã¾e nycht, Thus fra his King partit Ã¾is cristin knycht. CLXXXI Sanct Johnne, quhilk cure had tane of Ã¾is virgin, He estounit with gret proplexite. The sepultur gart till his hert propyne, Heirfor full meik he said: O sueit Lady, Ceiss for to sich, now ?our regrait lat be, And mak ?ow bown, or Ã¾at Ã¾e nycht draw neir, For till vmbeschew Ã¾e Jowis gret dangeir. CLXXXII It hevyit hir of Ã¾at departing, Bot nocht obstant scho wes obedient; Scho braist Ã¾e graif and salust hir sueit thing, Syne but delay scho to Ã¾e ciete went. In hir allane remanit Ã¾e foundament Off cristin faith, for [he] schew verralye Him Goddis sone predestinat to de. CLXXXIII In hi[r] closit scho brassit with bandis twa, Thai[r] dais thre scho maid hir inhabitance. A band wes dule of hir sonis wa, Quhilk nycht and day scho had in remembrance: The tothir wes profound confidance, That inmortall he suld rais in haist. Thus betuix pyne and faith hir hert is braist. CLXXXIV The Magdalyn besid Ã¾e sepultur With vthir ma throw hir deuocioun Baid for to spy, how scho oure saluiour Mycht se cum out withouttin suspecioun. Scho passit and maid raddy hir vnccioun, Bot Ã¾e ladyis hir causit mak resisting, Quhill Ã¾e thrid day, Ã¾at scho Ã¾e day saw spring. CLXXXV On setterday Ã¾e preistis of Ã¾e law To Pilat come and said, Ã¾ai had in mynd, That Crist [himself] suld to Ã¾e pepill schaw, On Ã¾e thrid day Ã¾at he suld riss fra pyne. Thairfor Ã¾ai said: Send [knichtis] sone of Ã¾in, Quhilk nycht and day haue of Ã¾e croce sic cure, That ay ane walk and keipe Ã¾e sepulture. CLXXXVI For and his folk out of Ã¾e graif him ta, Thai will proclame Ã¾at he is Crist our king, To quhome Ã¾e ded may nocht resistance ma; Sa be sic meyne Ã¾ai may in errour bring All Ã¾e pepill, quhilk bow suld of our ring. Sa Ã¾is last errour may ws mair confound, Than did Ã¾e first withoutin comparisound. CLXXXVII Pilat said: Tak of myn awtorite Men of armes, of his corps to haue cure. Thai maid na baid, bot [with] hillarite With Ã¾ai knichtis towart Ã¾e graif Ã¾[a]i fure. For sickar armes Ã¾ai soucht in Ã¾e sepulture; Syne him to keip left knychtis deligent, So left Ã¾e graif and to Ã¾e ciete went. CLXXXVIII Within a crage now closit is etern Off all Ã¾e warld Ã¾e generall Saluitour; Throw dispen[s]acioun [of] Ã¾e God superne Vnfaithfull men his corps now hes in cure. The body lyis in Ã¾e sepulture. Into Ã¾e lymbe Ã¾e saulis giffis conf[orting], Till Ã¾e gude theif, Ã¾at knew him Crist our King. CLXXXIX Thoucht cruell ded had with his bludy dart Off saule and body lowsit Ã¾e vnioun, He had no pith his Godhed forto part, Fra ane of Ã¾aim be ded in his passioun. For [Godis] sone wes wont till a persoun [Haue] saule and body to Diuinite. Fra Ã¾ame Ã¾e Godheid brak neuer vnite. CXC Thus in Ã¾e graif lyis Ã¾is woundit knycht Vndir Ã¾e cure of dedis dirk vmbrakill. Into Ã¾e lymbe Ã¾e saulis giffis licht To Ã¾e fadderis, quhilk had Ã¾e habitakill Thairfor Ã¾e knychtis but dreid sleippit sone, For his body sall riss in na corrupcioun. CXCI And to my Will ansuerit Wit and Ressoun: Moir sueit to speik of my Saluiour: Thow mycht me argo of a poynt of tressoun, Thy hurde to hid to skaill I tuke na cure. Bot sen Ã¾ou wait, my wit is febill and pure, Thy cruell ded with piete to recorde; Gude will for ded ressaue, sueit Jhesu, my Lord. THE RESSURECTIOUN. CXCII This blissit Prince baid giffand conforting To Ã¾e fathiris, quhilk in the lymbe Ã¾at lay, Quhill setterday had rungin at ewinnyng, And of Ã¾e sonday neir comyn wes Ã¾e day. Than be Ã¾am led out of Ã¾e lymbe away To parradice with gret solempnite, His nobill corps to ryiss syne bownit [he]. CXCIII With multitude he come of angellis sange And raissit vp the tempill of Salomoun, Quhilk Ã¾e Jowis on gude friday doun thrang, The cruell ded and pane of his passioun, As he befor had said in his sarmone: ?e sall Ã¾e tempill sla of my body, And I it sall raiss [vp] in dais thre. CXCIV With Ã¾at Ã¾e graif closit wes wounder fast, This nobill knycht throw his angelite On pasche day raiss, and so of Ã¾e graif out past Richt glorius with nobill wictory. [Till] his moder Ã¾an first apperit he, As ressoun wes, for gif scho for his ded [Was] maist in pane, scho suld haue first remeid. CXCV This hevinly queyne for hir sueit sonis dede Remanit still in lamentacioun. Hir Jhesu for all wofull [panis] remeid Come for to gif hir consolacioun; Till hir he maid his salutacioun, Sayand: Haill! haill! berar of the King, Quhilk hevin and erd hes into gouernyng. CXCVI Off Jhesus hevinly voce full blith scho wes, Thairfor on kne scho knellit reuerandly, And halsit him, syne till him couth scho pass, And he hir met with gret humilite; In hir armes scho braissit his body In sic fer[u]our, quhill all Ã¾e dule and wa, Quhilk for his ded scho sufferit, fled hir fra. CXCVII Syne in Ã¾is place togidder sat Ã¾ai doun, Off hevinly talk makand a riall pace, Quhen he hir schew Ã¾at his body [wes] soun, Boith [handis] and feit, his body and his face, Quhilk crewell men had all changit throw pane Rycht gloriusly remanit [h]all agane. CXCVIII Efter this Ã¾an schew our Saluiour To his moder, how Mary Magdalyn Had bene and soucht him at Ã¾e sepultur, And fand him nocht, and had Ã¾e angellis sene. As wofull wicht, [he] said, weipand hir ene, About Ã¾e graif scho wanderis to and fro; To confor[t] hir thairfor wald I go. APPERACIO DM AD MARIAM MAGDALENAM. CXCIX Seikand hir lord so lang scho persewerit, Plungit for him in gret perplexite, Quhill [atte last] Ã¾at he till hir apperit, Als said, [Ã¾is] woman to greit: Quhat alis the? Scho estimeit, Ã¾at gardener bene had he, Thairfor scho said: Gif Ã¾ou him tuke away, The place me schaw, Ã¾at I returne hy[m] may. CC Hir gret dollour na mar prolong wald he, Thairfor on hir he callit be hir name. Scho ansuerit: Rabone, [is it Ã¾e]? That is maister, for quhom wes all her mane. Scho went, Ã¾at Jowis away his corps had tane, Thairfor wanderand about Ã¾e sepultour With cairfull mynd scho soucht our Saluiour. CCI That hevinlie [voce] refrenit so hir spreit, That to Ã¾e erd richt law scho lowtit doun, With fervent hert pressit to brace his feit, Off hir synnis quhair scho gat remissioun, Quhen scho Ã¾ame wesche, or he tholit passioun. Bot him to nech he forbad, [and] pretend, Till his fader he had [nocht yet] ascend. THE THRID APPERACIOUN TO ÃE THRE MARYIS. CCII Quhen thir thre Maryis to the ciete went, Into the way to thame apperit he, And halsit Ã¾ame; syne said incontinent: Ga byid my brethir pas in Galalie, As I haue Ã¾ame said, Ã¾air Ã¾ai sall me see. Than on thair kneis Ã¾ai fell with deuocioun, Braissit his feit, Ã¾an fur Ã¾ai to Ã¾e toun. CCIII This Magdaleyn and hir followi[r]s twa To Ã¾ame rehersit, how Ã¾ai thair Lord had sene. Fra Ã¾at herd Peter, he baid nocht leif to ta At his brethir, na ?it Ã¾e Magdelyn; Bot to Ã¾e graif, quhair Ã¾e Mary[i]s had bene, He went in haist to find Ã¾at nobill duke, [Quham] he for dredour in his passioun forsuke. THE FOURT APPERACIOUN TO SANCT PETER. CCIV As Peter passit to Ã¾e sepultur, Him for to seik with mynd and will present, As doctouris sayis, Jhesus our Saluiour Than in the way till Peter him present, All confort him and bad him be deligent; His brethir all conferme into Ã¾e fay, Ffor of his ded Ã¾e pane wes past away. THE FIFT TO SANCT JAMES. CCV To Sanct James last apperit he, Quhilk wowit had Ã¾at he suld eit na breid Fra Thurisday, fra he hard he suld de, Quhill he him saw agane riss fra ded. Than Crist till him apperit in Ã¾at steid, Quhair he fastit and bad, a burd be set, Als breid he put, Ã¾at his brethir mycht eit. THE SEXT TO ÃE DISCIPILLIS PASSAND TILL EMAUS. CCVI Als to Ã¾e castell sevin myll fra Ã¾e ciete Off his discipillis passand on pasche day, His cruell pane rehersand with piete, To Ã¾aim Jhesus apperit in Ã¾e way, In pilgram weid; als to Ã¾am couth he say: Quhilk ar Ã¾e sarmonis quhilk ?e at Ã¾er speir, Gangand Ã¾e way as ?e all cairfull wer? CCVII Ane to name wes callit Cleophas, Said: Merwall is Ã¾at Ã¾ou misknawis allane Thir cruell dedis quhilum thir dais wes To Jhesus done into Jerusalem, Be oure princis how he wes tane [and] slane, Als tiruit [him] with mony panis fell, Quhom we trowit to redeme Iserall. CCVIII He said: O fulis and slaw in hert to trow In Ã¾e prophacy quhilk spokin is of me; Behuffit nocht Crist Ã¾is pane to tholl for ?ow, Als rise fra dede, syne in his glore entre? Syne he to Ã¾ame exponit the prophacy, Quhilk spokin had, Ã¾at he suld suffer pane, And riss fra ded on the thrid day agane. CCIX Quhen to Ã¾e castell neir cumin Ã¾ai war, He son?eit him, or he wald forthir pas. Thai him besoucht his jornay to defer, Ffor it wes lait and Ã¾e nycht cumin wes. Thair febill mynd he let na mair incress Into dispair, quhairfor with him thai fure In Ã¾e castell and schew him Saluature. CCX He wes oft wont, or he passit to ded, With his discipillis quhen he held cumpany, With his handis als cleyne to breik Ã¾e breid, As with ane knyf ane wald it Ã¾air in hy; He did so Ã¾an, syne delt Ã¾ame him by, Quhairthrow Ã¾ai knew Ã¾at he wes God of mycht, Rasit fra ded, bot he went fra Ã¾air sicht. CCXI Thir twa discipillis sone haistit Ã¾am agane To Ã¾e ciete and to Ã¾e postillis schew, Into Ã¾e way how he talkit with Ã¾ame, Breikand Ã¾e breid, syne how Ã¾ai him knew, All bot Thomas, till ane closat him drew, Quhairfor Ã¾at tyme with Ã¾ame wes nocht present Throu dispositioun of God omnipotent. THE SEVINT APPERACIOUN. CCXII Thoucht Ã¾ai Ã¾e durris had steikit all [to] exclude The cruell Jowis for Ã¾air Iniquite, Jhesus come and in Ã¾e myddis stude, And to Ã¾ame said: Peace [m]ot to ?ow be! Thai presumyt Ã¾at a spreit bene had he, Bot he Ã¾ame schew his handis and his feit, To gar Ã¾ame knaw Ã¾at he wes nocht a spreit. CCXIII Quhen Thomas come, Ã¾e discipillis him schew, That Ã¾ai had sene Ã¾e Lord in verite.

OCTAUA APPERACIO STI THOME.

CCXV Syn [till] Thomas, quhilk wes herdest in trouth, Crist his sermone directit specialie. His saule to tyne Ã¾is pietuous Prince had reuth, Quhairfor him thocht him for to certify, That he wes rissin in saule and in body. Thairfor he said: In my syd put Ã¾i hand, And ar no mair, bot be in faith constant. CCXVI Thy finger als put in my syd and knaw, The place ?it of Ã¾e nalis is patent. Than Thomas trowit, quhen he taikinnis saw, That our lord wes in his sicht present. Als in his hert wox [he] richt penitent. He said: Thomas, blissit mot Ã¾ai be, Quhilk saw me neuer, and trowis into me. NONA APPERACIO. CCXVII Efter Ã¾at Crist our blissit Saluiour Sustenit had his bitter passioun, His discipillis in temporall gudis pure, Quhilk keipit straitlie Ã¾e way of perfectioun, Efter his glorius resurrectioun The falt suppleyis of Ã¾air pouerte Be thir laubouris and [thir] industry. CCXVIII For Sanct Peter passit to Ã¾e fisching With vthir sevin into his cumpany, And all Ã¾at nycht wirkand Ã¾ai tuke no thing, Bot quhen Ã¾ai war in maist perplexite, Our lord apperit on land besyd Ã¾e sey, And on Ã¾e land him present to Ã¾ame schew, Bot nane of Ã¾ame him perfitlie knew. CCXIX He askit Ã¾ame, gif ony fische Ã¾ai had Raddy graithit refectioun forto be. Thai ansser maid, Crist Ã¾aim full meiklie bad Thair nettis put agane into Ã¾e see. Thai did command, fand fische aboundandlie, Knew, he wes Crist, to quhom must neid obey All kind of creatour in hevin, in erd and see. CCXX Fra Peter saw fra Crist cumin wes he, His hevinly grace kindillit his fer[u]our, Out of Ã¾e schip Ã¾at he lap in Ã¾e sey, That he mycht first speik with our Saluiour. Than Crist him maid baith heid and gouernour Till all Ã¾e laif, quhen Ã¾ai wer all present, In his dedis becauss he wes fervent. CCXXI O man, behald Ã¾i maker and thy king, Quhilk his seruandis wisseis into stres, Than all Ã¾e nycht had bene at Ã¾e fisching, And tane nathing, bot into laubour wes; Quhen Ã¾ai wer tirit and thocht away to pas, He come and schew, how Ã¾ai Ã¾e fische suld tak, Als on Ã¾e land with Ã¾ame baith eit and spak. THE TENT APPERACIOUN. CCXXII Syne to five hundreth and ma apperit he Off his discipillis, or his ascencioun. And, till mak end of dais fourtie Efter his glorius resurrectioun, He come and gaif Ã¾aim consolacioun, Als eit and drank, and to Ã¾aim schew Ã¾e way, How Ã¾ai vthir mycht conserue into Ã¾e fay. CCXXIII He thocht it tyme to schaw his majestie, Throw his awin mycht ascendand to Ã¾e glore, That he wald pas to Ã¾e hevin so hie: Thairfor the tyme he wald prolong no more, Bot he ascendit all Ã¾e pepill befor, To set his manheid on his Faderis rycht hand, Quhilk for his will to ded wes obeyand. CCXXIV Than all Ã¾e Sanctis in paradice Ã¾at wes mak Als eit and drank and schew Ã¾aim finalie, That he fra Ã¾ame as Ã¾an his leif wald tak, And till him pas quhilk send him heir to de; Bot ?e, he said, sall find in Ã¾e ciete, Quhill ?e be cled be vertu of Ã¾e lycht, Quhilk ?e sall get throw Ã¾e gud spreittis mycht. CCXXV He tuke his leif, als Peter commandit Ã¾ame, To Mont Olivit als bad Ã¾ai suld ascend; Thai did richt sua, and [he] apperit agane His ambassat to bring to finall end. For he till erd fra his Fader wes send, To de for man and man to grace restore, Out of Ã¾e mirknes Ã¾e man to gid to glore. CCXXVI With victory and trivmp celistiall, With angellis sang, and angellis in cumpany He ascendit, quhen Ã¾ai war present all, Fra Mont Olivit throw his agilite; Baith handis and face in hevin directit he, And Ã¾ai behaldand, and sa ascendit on hicht, Quhill a bricht clude him tuk out of Ã¾air sycht. CCXXVII Thocht I wer also fair in eloquens As ony ordour of angell cherubyn, I culd not schaw quhat cure and deligence Had sueit Jhesu, Ã¾e mannis saule to wyn, Born for our saik, and syn slane for our syn; Till hevin ascendit, till him a gid to be, His blude in drink, in meit left his bodie. CCXXVIII His discipillis baid with Ã¾at hevinly queyne Intill Syoun at Ã¾air deuocioun, Graithand Ã¾air mynd [and] conscience makand cleyne Of Ã¾e gude Spreit to tak remissioun. For Jhesu said or his ascencioun: ?e sall all heir in Ã¾e ciete remane, The Haly Gaist quhill I ?ou send agane. CCXXIX The tent day fra his ascencioun, Quhen terce wes cumin, quhilk ix is of Ã¾e hour, Out of Ã¾e hevin wes maid a suddane soun, Lik to Ã¾e cumin of ane felloun schour. And in Ã¾aim remanit in Ã¾at felloun stowr, Quhair Ã¾air remanit a hundreth and twenty Off his discipillis, bidand Ã¾at sycht to se. CCXXX In forme of fire Ã¾is Haly Spreit apperit, Thair cludy mynd with fire wer to attend, Quhilk dreid of dede had sa [with] trublance [sperit], That Crist to grant wes nane Ã¾at durst pretend. Bot fra to Ã¾aim Ã¾at confort wes send, He Ã¾ame inflambit so with cherite, That for Ã¾e faith Ã¾ai wer rady to de. CCXXXI O Etern God, quha hes wit to expreme The subtill wirking of Ã¾e Haly Gaist, Quhilk man fra ewill to God turnit sa cleyne? Off his cumin, and he haue hap to taist, He garris [the] occourar leif his gud in haist, And him follow in gret powerte; Ane hird a king, a propheit makis he. CCXXXII Off ane persewar he makis a protectour; And of a cowart, quhilk denyit his name Thris for ane word, or runyn wes ane hour, He garris contempne all erdly pane; and Ã¾ane Aganis knychtis and princis him allane Stand constantly, and Cristis faith defend; Leif as ane postill, syn as a marter end. CCXXXIII With sic a man of craft aquent to be, Quhilk is so without process of tyme, It is richt gude till him, Ã¾at suddenlie Wald be dischargit of all Ã¾e syn and cryme, Quhairfor he suld susteyne etarnall pyne; And his gret grace in schort tyme to retour The lang offence done to Ã¾i Saluitour. CCXXXIV And euery man is sicker of his grace, And he sa gret be of contritioun, That he pretend, and he haue tyme and space, Off his synnis to mak confessioun, Als he may mak satisfactioun, And syne no mair his Maker to offend, And be with me vnto Ã¾e warldis end.
