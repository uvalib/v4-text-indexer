      <field name="fulltext">ECHOES FROM THEOCRITUS We live by admiration, hope, and love. Wordsworth. TO WILFRED AUSTIN GILL, M.A. FELLOW AND LECTURER OF MAGDALENE COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE FELLOW OF KING'S COLLEGE, LONDON This Little Book IS DEDICATED I BATTUS O sun-browned shepherd, whose untutored grace Awoke the singer of that southern isle, What time he lingered in his father's place, And bore not yet his music to the Nile: How soon we make in life a tranquil space Whenas, our foolish cares forgot the while, We read the legend of thy classic face, And catch the lustre of thy lyric smile. Sing to us still in songs of tourney-type, As if the jealous Milon loitered near, Or let thy fingers twinkle o'er the pipe, And breathe a mellow cadence sweet and clear, Till all thy browsing lambs forego the ripe Arbutus buds, and circle round to hear. II A SHEPHERD MAIDEN On shores of Sicily a shape of Greece! Dear maid, what means this lonely communing With winds and waves? What fancy, what caprice, Has drawn thee from thy fellows? Do they fling Rude jests at thee? Or seekest thou surcease Of drowsy toil in noonday shepherding? Enough: our questions cannot break thy peace; Thou art a shade,—a long-entombèd thing. But still we see thy sun-lit face, O sweet, Shining eternal where it shone of yore; Still comes a vision of blue-veinèd feet That stand for ever on a pebbly shore; While round, the tidal waters flow and fleet And ripple, ripple, ripple, evermore. III DAPHNIS When Daphnis comes adown the purple steep From out the rolling mists that wrap the dawn, Leaving aloft his crag-encradled sheep, Leaving the snares that vex the dappled fawn, He gives the signal for the flight of sleep, And hurls a windy blast from hunter's horn At rose-hung lattices, whence maidens peep To glimpse the young glad herald of the morn. Then haply one will rise and bid him take A brimming draught of new-drawn milk a-foam; But fleet his feet and fain; he will not break His patient fast at any place but home, Where his fond mother waits him with a cake And lucent honey dripping from the comb. IV A SICILIAN NIGHT Come, stand we here within this cactus-brake, And let the leafy tangle cloak us round. It is the spot whereof the Seer spake— To nymph and faun a nightly trysting-ground. How still the scene! No zephyr stirs to shake The listening air. The trees are slumber-bound In soft repose. There's not a bird awake To witch the silence with a silver sound. Now haply shall the vision trance our eyes, By heedless mortals all too rarely scanned, Of mystic maidens in immortal guise, Who mingle shadowy hand with shadowy hand, And moving o'er the lilies circle-wise, Beat out with naked feet a saraband. V A SUMMER DAY IN OLD SICILY Gods, what a sun! I think the world's aglow. This garment irks me. Phœbus, it is hot! 'T were sad if Glycera should find me shot By flame-tipped arrows from the Archer's bow. Perchance he envies me,—the villain! O For one tree's shadow or a cliff-side grot! Where shall I shelter that he slay me not? In what cool air or element? I know. The sea shall save me from the sweltering land. Far out I'll wade, till creeping up and up, The cold green water quenches every limb. Then to the jealous god with lifted hand I'll pour libation from a rosy cup, And leap, and dive, and see the tunnies swim. VISIMAETHA, I Idyl ii. Go pluck me laurel-leaves, dear Thestylis, From any bough that shimmers in the moon; To dread Selene pray the while, and miss No single word of all the magic rune. She, only she, can grant the lover's boon, She, only she, restore a maiden's bliss; He comes not now, my sweet, but soon, O soon, He will be waiting, watching, for my kiss Twelve days; ah! is it twelve, since last we met? Quick wind about the bowl the ruddy skein! He has forgotten: cruel to forget! But this red wool shall rouse him into pain, This charm of charms shall wake his passion yet. O good my goddess, bring my Love again! VII SIMAETHA, II Now take the barley grains, sweet Thestylis, And fling them right and left upon the floor; If still he lingers, Delphis' bones like this Shall be disjoined upon a wreck-strewn shore. See how I burn the laurel shoots. They hiss And curl and crackle, blasted to the core; And Delphis' flesh shall wither up like this Unless he quickly seeks my shamèd door. In brazen pans the wax is melting fast: O gracious goddess, bid thy work begin! So melt young Delphis, till he speeds at last, Beneath my window wails his bitter sin,— Begs me to pardon all his folly past And of my clemency to let him in. VIII THE GOATHERD IN LOVE Idyl iii. 1-7. Good Tityrus, attend these goats awhile, And let me seek where Amaryllis hides, Crannied, I guess, beneath that rocky pile With fern atop and ivy-mantled sides. 'Tis there most days the merry girl abides, And flashes from her cave a sudden smile, Which like a pharos-flame her lover guides And makes him hope he looks not wholly vile. If thou canst guard the flock while I am gone, I will but notice how my lady fares, Then hasten back and take the crook anon. The goats are tame—the least of all my cares, Save one, that tawny thief; keep watch upon His bearing, lest he butt thee unawares. IX THE LOVE-SPELL Idyl iii. 28-30. I thought upon my lady as I strode Last night from labour, and bemoaned my lot, Uncertain if she loves or loves me not, Who gives no sign or token; till the road Bent round and took me past my Love's abode. And then some happy chance, I know not what, Moved me to try a spell long time forgot, By which love's issue may be clear foreshowed. I plucked a poppy from the wayside grass And struck it sharply on my naked arm, Striving to burst its inner heart. Alas! The petals only clung in painless calm. And then I knew how this could never be, That my dear Love's dear heart should break for me. X SIMICHIDAS Idyl vii. 21-26. Simichidas, thou love-demented loon! What haste is this, when no man's need doth call? Surely the gods have witched thee. 'Tis high noon. No creature else hath any strength at all; The spotted lizard sleeps upon the wall; The skiey larks drop earthward for the boon Of one still hour; the ants forget to crawl. Naught stirs except the stones beneath thy shoon. Nay, but I know; not love impels thee thus; Thy journey's end will bring a baser gain. Some burgher's feast or vintner's overplus Of trodden grapes—for these thy feet are fain. Well, go thy way; be fortunate. But us This pleasant shade retains and shall retain. XI AGEANAX Idyl vii. 52-62. Dear voyager, a lucky star be thine, To Mytilenè sailing over sea, Or foul or fair the constellations shine, Or east or west the wind-blown billows flee. May halcyon-birds that hover o'er the brine Diffuse abroad their own tranquillity, Till ocean stretches stilly as the wine In this deep cup which now we drain to thee. From lip to lip the merry circle through We pass the tankard and repeat thy name; And having pledged thee once, we pledge anew, Lest in thy friends' neglect thou suffer shame. God-speed to ship, good health to pious crew, Peace by the way, and port of noble fame! XII COMATAS Idyl vii. 78-82. In the great cedar chest for one whole year The pious goatherd by his lord confined, Because he reckoned not his flock more dear Than the dear Muse he served with loyal mind, Was fed by ministers whom none can bind— The blunt-faced bees that came from far and near, Spreading the Muse's signal on the wind, And found a crevice, and distilled the clear Sweet juice of flowers to feed the prisoned thrall, Till the slow months went round and he was free. Then, tuneful herds, spare not the fold and stall For sacrifice, nor fear your lord may see; The Muse can save her servants when they call— The Muse who sped that long captivity. XIII AT THE SHRINE OF PAN Idyl vii. 106-108. O goatish god, I pray you! Grant my prayer, And in my view great Zeus is less divine: Reject it,—at your peril,—if you dare! And look no more for any gift of mine. And who will then support this paltry shrine? Though you yourself subsist on frugal fare, Others have wants, and as the wise opine, 'Tis never well to leave the cupboard bare. Few thieves will quite good-humouredly forego Their wonted booty from the sacred sod; And herb-whips sting; I think at least you know With what effect some boys can wield the rod. Observe in time how thick these nettles grow, And flee the shame that waits a pauper god. XIV AT THE FARM OF PHRASIDAMUS Idyl vii. 133-146. Where elm and poplar branch to branch have grown, In cool deep shade the shepherds take their rest On beds of fragrant vine-leaves newly strown, Till the great sun declineth in the west. From thorny thickets round, as if opprest By secret care, the ring-dove maketh moan; With sudden cry from some remoter nest The nooning owlet hunts in dreams alone; A merry noise the burnt cicalas make, While honeyed horns are droning every where; The fruit-trees bend as though foredoomed to break With burden heavier than their strength can bear, And if the faintest zephyr seem to shake, Drop down an apple now, and now a pear. XV THE SINGING-MATCH, I Idyl viii. From upland pastures, where the flocks are wending Slow-footed ways through heather-bells and fern, Comes down a sound with sea-born murmurs blending Of lips that make sweet melody in turn. 'Tis Daphnis with Menalcas sharp-contending For the bright flute which both are keen to earn; While hard at hand a goatherd tarries, bending Rapt ears of judgment while the singers burn. Menalcas, first, hymns Love and all the blessing Which haps to field and fold where Love's feet stray; He tells of dearth and leanness clear confessing What ills befall, should Love despised betray; Ah, poor the man, though land and gold possessing, In whose demesne no Love consents to stay. XVI THE SINGING-MATCH, II Then Daphnis strikes the note of one that plaineth, Whose Love is not the Love he hoped to find; A Love which after blandishment disdaineth To bless the heart too readily resigned. Slight snares indeed are they which Eros feigneth, For well he knows that lover's eyes are blind, But none the captured beast more keenly paineth Than Love's entrapment cruelly unkind. All things have grief at times. When high winds shake it, The grove is grieved with plaintive murmurings; So grieves the woodland bird when fowlers take it, To feel the net encompassing its wings; And so the heart when peace and joy forsake it At Love's enravishment. Thus Daphnis sings. XVII THE SINGING-MATCH, III And last the goatherd, like as one awoken From sylvan slumbers on a summer day, Whose sleep is filled with birds, and only broken Because the thrushes all have flown away,— Uplifts his head, and with a word soft-spoken Declares the victor in the bloodless fray: “Thine is the flute, O Daphnis! Take the token, For thou hast conquered with the crowning lay. And, O, if thou wilt teach to carol brightly This mouth of mine, as through the fields we go, To thee shall fall a monster goat that nightly Makes every milking-bowl to overflow.” Then clapped the lad his hands, and leapt as lightly As weanling fawns that leap around the doe. XVIII MENALCAS Idyl viii. 63-66. With limbs out-stretched along the thymy ground The dog Lampùrus slumbers in the shade, While tender ewes unchecked by warning sound Go wandering idly through the sylvan glade, In guileless ignorance all undismayed By cruel beasts that hold the copse around And make the herd Menalcas half-afraid— The boyish herd who cries: “O heedless hound, Is this thy helping of my timorous youth— To let the flock disperse the woods among, With no preventing feet, no faithful tongue? The very wolves might show a deeper ruth, And spare to raven with ensanguined tooth, Seeing the shepherd of the sheep is young.” XIX THE TOMB OF DIOCLES Idyl xii. 27-33. Here, stranger, pause, and take a moment's ease With pleasant thinking on a good man dead. This marble marks the tomb of Diocles; Say not that virtue sleeps unhallowèd! The grateful tribes delight with arts like these To deck the pillow of a noble head. Nor are these all; beneath yon arching trees The merriest chorus of the spring is led. For on a day from country cots around Come troops of ruddy children fair of face, And forming rings about this holy ground, Contest the guerdon of a bright embrace; And whoso kisseth with the deftest grace Goes homeward to his mother, happy, crowned. XX HYLAS Idyl xiii. What pool is this by galingale surrounded, With parsley and tall iris overgrown? It is the pool whose wayward nymphs confounded The quest of Heracles to glut their own Desire of love. Its depths hath no man sounded Save the young Mysian argonaut alone, When round his drooping neck he felt, astounded, The cruel grasp that sank him like a stone. Through all the land the Hero wandered, crying “Hylas!” and “Hylas!” till the close of day, And thrice there came a feeble voice replying From watery caverns where the prisoner lay; Yet to his ear it seemed but as the sighing Of zephyrs through the forest far away. XXI THE TUNNY-FISHERS Idyl xxi. In rude log-cabin by the lone sea-shore Two aged fishers slept the sleep of toil. Rough was their life, and scant their household store, Scarce aught but hooks and nets and seamen's coil. To one of these came visions of strange spoil; He caught a fish—such fish as none before Caught ever, bright with sheen and glittering foil, A golden fish; and made high vows no more To sail the seas, but spend the troven gold; Then woke and wept to starve or be forsworn. To whom his fellow: “Surely, being old, Thou drivellest. Vow and vision both are born Of air. Catch living fish or die.” And cold Through eastern windows crept the ashy dawn. XXII THE YOUTH OF HERACLES Idyl xxiv. 101-102. As when in flowerful gardens, lofty-girt With thicket-hedge of ilex, oak, and vine, Where northern breezes do no mortal hurt, And warmer suns have constant leave to shine, A tender sapling, be it larch or pine, Shoots always upwards with a daily spirt, Thanks to the woven boughs that round it twine, Thanks to the shelter of its leafy skirt: So in a tranquil and secluded place, Where never pierced the faintest note of harm, The Argive hero grew and waxed apace, Enclosed and compassed by Alcmena's arm; And knew not as he watched the mother's-face The mother's-love that fenced him from alarm. XXIII THE FLUTE OF DAPHNIS Epigram ii. I am the flute of Daphnis. On this wall He nailed his tribute to the great god Pan, What time he grew from boyhood, shapely, tall, And felt the first deep ardours of a man. Through adult veins more swift the song-tide ran,— A vernal stream whose swollen torrents call For instant ease in utterance. Then began That course of triumph reverenced by all. Him the gods loved, and more than other men Blessed with the flower of beauty, and endowed His soul of music with the strength of ten. Now on a festal day I see the crowd Look fondly at my resting-place, and when I think whose lips have pressed me, I am proud. XXIV A SACRED GROVE Epigram iv. I know a spot where love delights to dream, Because he finds his fancies happen true. Within its fence no myrtle ever grew That failed in wealth of flower; no sunny beam Has used its vantage vainly. You might deem Yourself a happy plant and blossom too, Or be a bird and sing as thrushes do, So sweet in that fair place doth nature seem. A matted vine invests the rocks above, And tries to kiss a runlet leaping through With endless laughter. Hither at noon comes Love And woos the god who is not hard to woo, Taking his answer from the nested dove That ever hymneth skies for ever blue. XXV A SYLVAN REVEL Epigram v. What ho! my shepherds, sweet it were To fill with song this leafy glade. Bring harp and flute. The gods have made An hour for music. Daphnis there Shall give the note a jocund blare From out his horn. The rest will aid Wiih fifes and drums, and charm the shade, And rout the dusky wings of care. We'll pipe to fox and wolf and bear. We'll wake the wood with rataplan, Fetch every beast from every lair, Make every creature dance who can, Set every Satyr's hoof in air, And tickle both the feet of Pan! XXVI THYRSIS Epigram vi. Sad Thyrsis weeps till his blue eyes are dim, Because the wolf has torn his pride away,— The little kid so apt for sport and play, Which knew his voice and loved to follow him. Who would not weep that cruel fate and grim Should end her pranks on this unhappy day, And give her tender innocence a prey For savage jaws to harry limb from limb? Yet think, O shepherd, how thy tears are vain To rouse the dead or bring the slain again; Beyond all hope her body lies, alack! Devoured she is; no bones of her remain. The leaping hounds are on the murderer's track, But will they, can they, bear thy darling back? XXVII CLEONICUS Epigram ix. Let sailors watch the waning Pleiades, And keep the shore. This man, made over-bold By godless pride, and too much greed of gold, Setting his gains before his health and ease, Ran up his sails to catch the whistling breeze: Whose corpse, ere now, the restless waves have rolled From deep to deep, while all his freight, unsold, Is tossed upon the tumult of the seas. Such fate had one whose avaricious eyes Lured him to peril in a mad emprise. Yea, from the Syrian coast to Thasos bound, He slipped his anchor with rich merchandise, While the wet stars were slipping from the skies, And with the drowning stars untimely drowned. XXVIII THE EPITAPH OF EUSTHENES Epigram xi. A Bard is buried here, not strong, but sweet; A Teacher too, not great, but gently wise; This modest stone (the burghers thought it meet) May tell the world where so much virtue lies. His happy skill it was in mart and street To scan men's faces with a true surmise, Follow the spirit to its inmost seat, And read the soul reflected in the eyes. No part had he in catholic renown, Which none but god-inspirèd poets share; Not his to trail the philosophic gown, That only sages of the School may wear; But his at least to fill an alien town With friends, who make his tomb their loving care. XXIX THE MONUMENT OF CLEITA Epigram xviii. Here Cleita sleeps. You ask her life and race? Read on, and learn a simple tale and true. A nurse she was from the far land of Thrace, Who tended little Medëus while he grew A healthy, happy child, and did imbue His nascent mind with godliness and grace; So fencing him from evil that he knew No word of what is impious or base. And when at length, her tale of years all told, She came to lie in this reposeful spot, Young Medëus, still a child, but sagely old, Upreared this monument, that unforgot The care beyond his recompense of gold Might live a memory and perish not. XXX THE GRAVE OF HIPPONAX Epigram xxi. Here lies a bard, Hippònax—honoured name! Sweet were the songs that won him endless praise, And yet his life was sweeter than his lays. Traveller, a question fronts thee: Canst thou claim Kinship with such in conduct void of blame? If not, forbear this precinct; go thy ways; Lest some bright watcher of the tomb should raise A jealous hand to cover thee with shame. But if thy soul is free from shade of guilt, Or, having sinned, hath been at length forgiven, To thee all rights of common kin belong; Lay down thy weary limbs, and, if thou wilt, Let slumber wrap them round, nor fear that Heaven Will suffer any sprite to do thee wrong.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MISCELLANEOUS SONNETS I TO CERTAIN KIND CRITICS O stalwart friends, O strong-souled flatterers, Who bid me shape my verse in ampler mode, And trumpet forth a ballad, epic, ode,— How shall I answer you? When impulse stirs The genuine Bard, he soars unasked: but, sirs, What power can lift the meaner sort? Why goad My ambling Muse along an upland road Which leadeth not to any haunt of hers? She hath no mind for “freaks upon the fells,” No wish to hear the storm-wind rattling by; She loves her cowslips more than immortelles, Her garden-closes than the abysmal sky: In a green dale her chosen sweetheart dwells: The mountain-height she must not, dare not, try. II A WOODLAND STREAM, I Drawn by the noise of water, and its gleam Flashed through the foxgloves nodding o'er the brink, I lead my wayward fancy down to drink From the still depths of this embow'rèd stream. Arch over arch the sun-gilt branches link Their shadowy leaves, escaped by many a beam Cleaving the limpid wave, as sleepers sink Through endless æther in a June-night dream. Deep down in tranquil gloom, where happy breeds A world of elfin shapes to light denied, Amid lush tangle of the swaling weeds The creatures of the streamlet leap and glide,— Glad in the shelter of its tufted reeds, Lulled by the ceaseless ripple of its tide. III A WOODLAND STREAM, II How in this nook the ancient creed comes near, And seems to keep its right untarnished still! If there be guardian sprites of wood and rill, I think a simple faith would see them here; A faith that watched the darkly rolling year Through days of death and sleeping-times, until The constant months their slow sad round fulfil To wake the spring-god from his wintry bier. Adonis! Ah, it is not all profane— This modern earth. Come forth, ye choral band! Your Lady bends to kiss the lips again, The opening lips. 'Tis meet ye were at hand. So ran the song through April wind and rain; And, lo, the glad fruition where I stand! IV A WOODLAND STREAM, III I cannot tell what spirit-forms are free To suck the secret of this green delight: I only feel it was not made for me— Not mine to use it with a spirit's right. I am as other men—poor aliens we From Nature's paradise in Heaven's despite, Who only glimpse its charm with blinded sight, And may not enter, having lost the key. Yet surely I were more than man, or less, Could I allure my hungry soul away From such a spot, with such a power to bless, And win not e'en what birds and fishes may: At least I have the right of brutishness, Who am in part an animal as they. V A WOODLAND STREAM, IV Forgive me, gentle creatures of the stream, And ye that in my fancy guard their bliss; Account me not a murderer, nor deem My heart's offending darker than it is; The trespass in my thought is only this— To ask a boon it doth not misbeseem Your purity to grant, though well I wis I am not worthy of a gift supreme. Sinful I come from worlds where sin is rife, But not with foul intent your peace to ban; I would but use the privilege of life, And joy with Nature's joy while body can, Yea, feel, in spite of all that breedeth strife, Her spirit still has fellowship with man. VI IN THE MEADOW The Cuckoo called me, but I answered “Nay;” The Thrush said “Come,” and I grew ill-content; Last spake the Blackbird; then my heart forewent Her studious purpose, and I broke the day. Now in the meadow-grass, a world away From aught of human life, that heart is blent With leaf, stem, flower, in sweet entanglement, Meshed by the young luxuriance of May, The ox-eyed daisies glimpse me as I lie; Strange creeping things their devious steps have stayed, And glut their wonderment from bloom and blade; While feathery balls are bending cubit-high Between my quivering eyelids and the sky, To mock me with a phantasy of shade. VII A RUSTIC BRIDGE, I Blest be the kindly heart of him who spanned This sylvan streamlet with a bridge,—to me Most grateful, and to all burnt souls who flee For shelter from the torrid pasture-land. Upon the slender plank I pause and stand, Leaning hot arms upon the slender rail. The foxglove-bloom I lately plucked looks frail And like to wither in my feverish hand. But here is sweet salvation,—rest and shade, Awning of branches, every branch a bower, And water for the sun-struck body's wound. See! ferns and hemlock, and a shingle frayed From pebbly banks, where the spread stream has power To lave wood-flowers that droop with imminent swound. VIII A RUSTIC BRIDGE, II Into the stream I drop my foxglove-bell, The rapid stream, the laughing leaping stream: Through watery shades it throws a purple beam; And each cool beast that drags a twisted shell Beholds far off the palpitating swell, And hears the runlet, brawling over stones, Give murmurous thanks, like some old monk at Nones, When the red sun makes drowsy-warm his cell. So runs my fancy. But mine eyes have play No deeper than the shining-shadowy floor; The rest is secret as a moonless night. Down floats my bell, away and still away, Past the tall hemlock, round the fern-clad shore, Beyond the reedy shallows, out of sight. IX POPPIES O poppies in the meadow red and red, And red and red through all the ripening corn, I like the courage of that flaunting head Which fronts the world so ragged, bold, and torn. Why have our singers left your name unsaid, Who might at least have flung you scorn for scorn, Not passed you by to grieve unanswerèd, And for pure lack of foemen grow forlorn? See where I lift my hand to dash you dead— What! is the joy of battle more than pain? Nay, let us fight with angry words instead: O cursèd flowers and vile, O stain and bane, Go, turn your shameless faces to the bed! Content ye yet,—or shall I strike again? X ON THE BEACH When you lie there in such supreme content, I feel a slight, a momentary pain, Lest the strong heart so utterly unbent Should take no more its ancient force again; But, having fed on lotos-leaves, be fain To feed so always, as on food god-sent, And thus in Nature's paradise remain A willing thrall to Nature's blandishment. Dream on to-day, and fancy life a psalm Best set to quiet melody of seas, That meet on summer sands the summer breeze To kiss the rising ripples into calm; But when the morrow dawns, arise, appease The natural craving of a strong right arm. XI FROM A QUIET PLACE As when a maiden, looking through the leaves That fence her garden from the common way, Observes each passer-by, and softly weaves A web of fiction, while her fancies play Round each new figure; till she half believes The tale so fashioned—tale which haply may Be true, or if it pleasantly deceives, No after-truth can dawn to counter-say: So watch I from this world-sequestered nook Time's heroes on the stage they tread so well, Matching their motives with their outward look, And run a single thread through all they do; Nor would be told, what none is here to tell, How much or little of my thought is true. XII SUBURBAN MEADOWS How calmly drops the dew on tree and plant, While round each pendulous leaf the cool airs blow! The neighbour city has no sign to show Of all its grim machines that toil and pant, Except a sky that coal makes confidant: But there the human rivers ebb and flow, And thither was I wonted once to go With heart not ill at ease or recusant. Here now I love to wander morn and eve, Till oaks and elms have grown oracular; Yet conscious that my soberest thoughts receive A tinge of tumult from the smoke afar; And scarcely know to which I most belong— These simple fields or that unsimple throng. XIII AN AUTUMN THOUGHT It was a clear October morn. The dell After a frosty night lay thick with brown Dead leaves. And still they stirred and fluttered down, Leaving a fringe against the sky to tell Where once that sky had been invisible, Cloaked by their green luxuriance. And indeed Mine eyes could notice how the vault, thus freed, Grew bright and brighter for each leaf that fell. So cuts the frost which kills our summer vows. When shades of bliss we hoped eterne decay, And all our pleasant leaves are stripped away, We find what ampler view the frost allows. Through earthly damps we catch the heavenly day, And God's truth clearest under cold bare boughs. XIV TOWARDS EVENING At morn we cried, “O pregnant hours of light, What crystal thoughts declared in golden speech Your lucid-lipped activities shall teach, Ere sunset gives the glutted world to night! All day we strove to learn, if learn we might; We groped for truth, but truth was hard to reach; A babble of tongues contended each with each, 'Mid blows that iron-fisted engines smite. The day is gone. Its voices garrulous Have given us naught. The void is yet to fill. Shall not the silence prove more generous? The still eve comes: ah, let us too be still! Our better thoughts are ever borne to us On wings unfanned by any breeze of will. XV A CHANGE You bid me sing! Alas, the fount is dry From which were drawn the songs you loved of old. Long since I wandered from the field and fold, And sought the tedious town, poor foolish I! Even a true-born bard forgets the sky When in the babbling street his days are told. Free flows his verse to preach and teach and scold, But fast his thoughts of beauty fade and die. Sometimes a face may rouse him, or a child's Soft prattle stir the genius at his heart. Sometime his own brain's solitary wilds Enclose him; for a space he dwells apart. But once enthralled to men and man's gross fashion, He cnokes the spring-flood of his purest passion. XVI ON THE SUMMIT Above the tarn, above the mantling wood, My feet have gained at length the summit's pride, Where cloud to peak, and peak to cloud, hath cried Through countless years, “God is, and God is good.” O would that where I stand a thousand stood! Such view to vision scarce pre-sanctified Would more of God reveal than aught beside, Yea, more than convent-cell or monkish hood. For cloistered meditation needeth art Beyond the narrow scope of common skill; But here the rudest, set the world apart, Nearer to heaven by this fair height of hill, Might trust the promptings of his natural heart To worship, and consider, and be still. XVII ON THE BEACH IN NOVEMBER My heart's Ideal, that somewhere out of sight Art beautiful and gracious and alone,— Haply where blue Saronic waves are blown On shores that keep some touch of old delight,— How welcome is thy memory, and how bright, To one who watches over leagues of stone These chilly northern waters creep and moan From weary morning unto weary night. O Shade-form, lovelier than the living crowd, So kind to votaries, yet thyself unvowed, So free to human fancies, fancy-free, My vagrant thought goes out to thee, to thee, As wandering lonelier than the Poet's cloud, I listen to the wash of this dull sea. XVIII SOMETHING LOST How changed is Nature from the Time antique! The world we see to-day is dumb and cold: It has no word for us. Not thus of old It won heart-worship from the enamoured Greek. Through all fair forms he heard the Beauty speak; To him glad tidings of the unknown were told By babbling runlets, or sublimely rolled In thunder from the cloud-enveloped peak. He caught a message at the oak's great girth, While prisoned Hamadryads weirdly sang: He stood where Delphi's Voice had chasm-birth, And o'er strange vapour watched the Sibyl hang; Or where, mid throbbings of the tremulous earth, The caldrons of Dodona pulsed and rang. XIX THE CHILDREN'S PRIVILEGE I love to mark a childish band at play Through flowerful meadows or a woodland scene: The linnets in the copse are not so gay, The squirrels in the forest not so keen: They bear themselves with such ecstatic mien As only masters of a Mystery may. It moves my heart to think I too have been In younger years initiate as they. This Nature that we marvel at, and find Impenetrable, is not so to them, But opens half her secrets to their gaze, And leads their footsteps in romantic ways; And none shall touch her garment's utmost hem, Unless with childhood's unreflective mind. XX A VIEW Here is the hill-top. Look! Not moor or fen, Not wood or pasture, circles round the steep; But houses upon houses, thousand-deep, The merchant's palace and the pauper's den. We are alone,—beyond all mortal ken; Only the birds are with us and the sheep. We are alone; and yet one giant's-leap Would land us in the flood of hurrying men. If e'er I step from out that turbid stream To spend an hour in thought, I pass it here: For good it is across our idlest dream To see the light of manhood shining clear; And solitude is sweetest, as I deem, When half-a-million hearts are beating near. XXI SARK O happy Fate, which in the golden prime Of this glad summer hast embarked my soul, Despite her craven fears of rock and shoal, And steered her safe to this delicious clime, Where, careless of the World, and Life, and Time, Beneath the sun-lit canopy of sky She joys to watch the hours go floating by, And find her fancies crisping into rhyme. All day upon the cliff-top like a bird I keep my nest, and lie in dreamful ease, 'Mid tall o'erarching grasses gently stirred By the soft burden of the slumb'rous breeze— The rhythmic plash of oarage faintly heard, And long low murmur of the shoreward seas. XXII IN FEBRUARY At last! Through murk that seemed too thick for rending, The sun has burst with full unclouded ray; And hark, how soon the little birds are sending Glad canticles from naked bush and spray. Yet timidly; from time to time suspending Their song, as if they feared to be so gay, When every hour may bring the sunlight's ending And all the gold relapse again to grey. Pipe on, small songsters! You and I together Will catch the passing glory while we may. No Fate forbids to preen a drooping feather, Give voice to hope, and try a broken lay. What if the morrow break in wintry weather— Is it not something that we sing to-day? XXIII IN THE CITY, I A stranger, from the country's calm retreat And heavenly boon of sweet tranquillity, I tread with faltering steps the dusty street, And seek in vain the God I long to see. These traffickers who hold the world in fee— They hurry past with such determined feet! I seem to read in every face I meet, “Am I not strong? What is thy God to me?” He was so sweet to all the fields, so great Among the hills, so fair in every glen, So good to countless hungering eyes that wait Upon His hand; I felt the Presence then— Too distant now to cheer me desolate In this grim weary wilderness of men. XXIV IN THE CITY, II Nay, but thy God is near thee where thou wilt, Not less nor more in solitude or crowd. Take heart of grace, and go not heavy-browed, Unless it be for consciousness of guilt. God made the country; yea, but God hath built All dwellings of his creatures, and endowed Their lives with courage—else like water spilt Upon the earth or as a melting cloud. Haply they know it not, who never raise A heavenward eye; they do the Giver wrong, And yet He blesses. Thou with purer gaze Shalt surely see the Arm that makes thee strong; And if at times amid these murky ways The vision pales, it will not be for long. XXV A COLLEGE FOR DECAYED MERCHANTS, I He well deserved of Age and Broken Means, Who planned in Mercy's cause this fair retreat. His heart is dust; but still his pity leans To succour those who faint with long-borne heat,— Pale traffickers grown old in clamorous scenes, Who sought the gold it was not theirs to meet; Content at last to embrace such kindly screens As shut the wearied from the vigorous feet. The sober reds of tile and brick, the door High-arched and crowned with shielded blazonries, The little pillared court with stony floor, Are eloquent of sweet tranquillities,— And garden-ground expanding more and more, With paths that wind amid perpetual trees. XXVI A COLLEGE FOR DECAYED MERCHANTS, II Not seldom in these walks the Poet strolls, And most when summer spreads her leaves; for then Across the lawn his chair the cripple rolls,— No bower but hath its agèd denizen: And if from chapel-roof the slow bell tolls, Saith Four-score-years to Three-score-years-and-ten,— “We rest a college of immortal souls, Albeit a company of dying men.” What time desire for calm has waxen deep, And life's hot energies are all decayed, I think it would be grateful here to sleep,— I think it would be pleasant so to fade,— With scarce a clock to tell how minutes creep, And curtained by this venerable shade. XXVII A FOOTBALL PLAYER If I could paint you, friend, as you stand there, Guard of the goal, defensive, open-eyed, Watching the tortured bladder slide and glide Under the twinkling feet; arms bare, head bare, The breeze a-tremble through crow-tufts of hair; Red-brown in face, and ruddier having spied A wily foeman breaking from the side; Aware of him,—of all else unaware: If I could limn you, as you leap and fling Your weight against his passage, like a wall; Clutch him, and collar him, and rudely cling For one brief moment till he falls—you fall: My sketch would have what Art can never give— Sinew and breath and body; it would live. XXVIII A CRICKET BOWLER Two minutes' rest till the next man goes in! The tired arms lie with every sinew slack On the mown grass. Unbent the supple back, And elbows apt to make the leather spin Up the slow bat and round the unwary shin,— In knavish hands a most unkindly knack; But no guile shelters under this boy's black Crisp hair, frank eyes, and honest English skin. Two minutes only. Conscious of a name, The new man plants his weapon with profound Long-practised skill that no mere trick may scare. Not loth, the rested lad resumes the game: The flung ball takes one madding tortuous bound, And the mid-stump three somersaults in air. XXIX BEFORE THE RACE The impatient starter waxeth saturnine. “Is the bell cracked?” he cries. They make it sound: And six tall lads break through the standers-round. I watch with Mary while they form in line; White-jersey'd all, but each with some small sign, A broidered badge or shield with painted ground, And one with crimson kerchief sash-wise bound; I think we know that token, neighbour mine. Willie, they call you best of nimble wights; Yet brutal Fate shall whelm in slippery ways Two soles at least. Will it be you she spites? Ah well! 'Tis not so much to win the bays. Uncrowned or crowned, the struggle still delights; It is the effort, not the palm, we praise. XXX THE NEW CRICKET-GROUND The loveliness of Earth is still unspent: Her beauties, singly known, combined are strange: And with what fondness she doth freshly range Her ancient gems for man's new ravishment! On this soft dew-fed tree-girt sward of Kent The cricket-god to-day is first enthroned, The dun herd banished, and its pasture owned By white-clad players and their snowy tent. The field I knew before, the lads I knew, And oft elsewhere have watched their pleasant game; But now an added lustre comes to view, Familiar features look no more the same; The new-set picture gains another hue, And sheds another glory on its frame. XXXI A PALÆSTRAL STUDY The curves of beauty are not softly wrought: These quivering limbs by strong hid muscles held In attitudes of wonder, and compelled Through shapes more sinuous than a sculptor's thought, Tell of dull matter splendidly distraught, Whisper of mutinies divinely quelled,— Weak indolence of flesh, that long rebelled, The spirit's domination bravely taught. And all man's loveliest works are cut with pain. Beneath the perfect art we know the strain, Intense, defined, how deep soe'er it lies. From each high master-piece our souls refrain, Not tired of gazing, but with stretchèd eyes Made hot by radiant flames of sacrifice. XXXII CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH A CONTRAST I love to watch a rout of merry boys Released from school for play, and nothing loth To make amends for late incurious sloth By wild activity and strident noise; But more to mark the lads of larger growth Move fieldward with such perfect equipoise, As if constricted by an inward oath To scorn the younger age and clamorous joys; Prepared no less for pastime all their own, A silent strenuous game of hand and knee, Where no man speaks, but a round ball is thrown And kicked and run upon with solemn glee, And every struggle takes an earnest tone, And rudest sport a sober dignity. XXXIII A REBUKE Dear friend, why takes your brow so dark a hue Because these babes prefer a noisy bliss? They laugh too loud perhaps; but surely 't is A venial fault where merry sounds are few. When you were young, the world was young with you; Now you are old, and must you grieve for this— That still the world is young, or take amiss The sport of those to whom delight is due? We press and strive and toil from morn till eve; From eve to morn our waking thoughts are grim. Were children silent, we should half believe That joy was dead—its lamp would burn so dim. But in one boy's halloo it finds reprieve, And lives for us because it lives for him. XXXIV THE POWER OF CHILDHOOD O children, if the paradise our dream Is found at all upon this earth we fret, To you the glory and to us the debt Must aye belong! Forgive us if we seem To hold our corded bales in more esteem. The cares of market crowd our souls; and yet In busiest hours we never quite forget With what mild innocence your round eyes beam. Give kisses, lest we grow too covetous Of pilèd treasure on our dusty shelves: Be near to guard when wealth is perilous, For ye are strong and heaven-defended elves: Lift up your lithe brown hands and pray for us, Who dare not ask the cheapest boon ourselves. XXXV FLORA Some faces scarce are born of earth, they say; Thine is not one of them, and yet 'tis fair; Showing the buds of hope in soft array, Which presently will burst and blossom there; Now small as bells that Alpine meadows bear,— Too low for any boisterous wind to sway. Why should we think it shame for youth to wear A beauty portioned from the natural day? 'T is thine to teach us what dull hearts forget, How near of kin we are to springing flowers. The sap from Nature's stem is in us yet; Young life is conscious of uncancelled powers. And happy they who, ere youth's sun has set, Enjoy the golden unreturning hours. XXXVI BILL: A PORTRAIT I know a lad with sun-illumined eyes, Whose constant heaven is fleckless of a cloud; He treads the earth with heavy steps and proud, As if the gods had given him for a prize Its beauty and its strength. What money buys Is his; and his the reverence unavowed Of toiling men for men who never bowed Their backs to any burden anywise. And if you talk of pain, of doubt, of ill, He smiles and shakes his head, as who should say, “The thing is black, or white, or what you will: Let Folly rule, or Wisdom: any way I am the dog for whom this merry day Was made, and I enjoy it.” That is Bill. XXXVII FROM ANY POET O fair and Young, we singers only lift A mirror to your beauty dimly true, And what you gave us, that we give to you. And in returning minimise the gift. We trifle like an artist brought to view The nuggets gleaming in a golden drift, Who, while the busy miners sift and sift, Will take his idle brush and paint a few. O Young and Glad, O Shapely, Fair, and Strong, Yours is the soul of verse to make, not mar! In you is loveliness: to you belong Glory and grace: we sing but what you are. Pleasant the song perchance; but O how far The beauty sung of doth excel the song! XXXVIII A STORY OF AURELIUS With foliage gathered from the sacred bough Young Marcus worshipped where the Salii dwell Before the warrior-god he served so well, What time they flung their garlands, striving how They best might crown the statue's head. And now A strange thing happened (so the chroniques tell)— The other chaplets missed their aim, and fell: Only the boy's wreath lighted on the brow. And was the god or passive or displeased? I think Parnassus joins Olympus here: O hearts of youth, so brightly frankly true, To gods and bards alike your praise is dear; Though wreaths from adult hands be all unseized, Our crowns are crowns indeed if thrown by you! XXXIX A THOUGHT FROM PINDAR NEM. V Twin immortalities man's art doth give To man; both fair; both noble; one supreme. The sculptor beating out his portrait scheme Can make the marble statue breathe and live; Yet with a life cold, silent, locative; It cannot break its stone-eternal dream, Or step to join the busy human stream, But dwells in some high fane a hieroglyph. Not so the poet. Hero, if thy name Lives in his verse, it lives indeed. For then In every ship thou sailest passenger To every town where aught of soul doth stir, Through street and market borne, at camp and game, And on the lips and in the hearts of men! XL VIRGIL Not for the glittering splendour of thy verse, O Seer-singer, do we count thee dear; Not for the prowess of the Ænean spear, The long brave battling with the Dardan curse; But for thy human heart's sake we rehearse Thy deep lines eloquent with hope and fear; Thou too wert human; yea, to thee were near The Fates that are about us and coerce. Surely no softer subtler foot ere trod Regions unlit save by the spirit's flame; And through all shadows this high faith was thine: Powerless is death to quench the spark divine; Man's soul unfettered turneth whence it came; God its fruition, for its seed was God. XLI IN THE CLOISTERS WINCHESTER COLLEGE, I I walked to-day where Past and Present meet, In that grey cloister eloquent of years, Which ever groweth old, yet ever hears The same glad echo of unaging feet. Only from brass and stone some quaint conceit, The monument of long-forgotten tears, Whispers of vanished lives, of spent careers, And hearts that, beating once, have ceased to beat. And as I walked, I heard the boys who played Beyond the quiet precinct, and I said— “How broad the gulf which deliving Time has made Between those happy living and these dead.” And, lo, I spied a grave new-garlanded, And on the wall a boyish face that prayed. XLII IN THE CLOISTERS WINCHESTER COLLEGE, II Two things are ever with us, youth and death— The Faun that pipes, and Pluto unbeguiled; From age to age still plays the eternal child, Nor heeds the eternal doom that followeth. Ah, precious days of unreflecting breath! There lay (so might we fancy) one who smiled Through all life's paradox unreconciled, Enjoying years the grown man squandereth. And if his latest hour was touched with pain, And some dim trouble crossed his childish brain, He knew no fear,—in death more blest than we. And now from God's clear light he smiles again, Not ill-content his mortal part to see In such a spot, amid such company. XLIII TWO THOUGHTS When I reflect how small a space I fill In this great teeming world of labourers, How little I can do with strongest will, How marred that little by most hateful blurs,— The fancy overwhelms me, and deters My soul from putting forth so poor a skill: Let me be counted with those worshippers Who lie before God's altar, and are still. But then I think (for healthier moments come), This power of will, this natural force of hand,— What do they mean, if working be not wise? Forbear to weigh thy work, O soul! Arise, And join thee to that nobler sturdier band Whose worship is not idle, fruitless, dumb. XLIV A BENEDICTION Now may God bless thee for thy face, at least, Seeing there is such comfort in the mere Mute watching of it,—yea, a constant feast Of golden glamour when the days are drear, And summer harmonies have sunk and ceased. This is the very death-day of the year; Yet Beauty is not dead; thou art her priest, Thy face her temple 'mid the shed leaves here. And if for me no Spring should ever prank My fields again with daisies anywhere, And though all other faces dull and blank Look through the darkness till they seem to bear The guise of death, I cannot choose but thank My God for having fashioned one so fair. XLV THE EXCUSE If there were anything that I could do, Which done would make your comfort more complete, Think not I should continue this low seat, And drink your bountihead as hitherto; Indeed I would most gladly toil for you: And yet, believe me, it might happen, sweet, That I should come in time to work my feat For the feat's sake, forgetting whence it grew, And so displacing love, should lose love so. But since your life is full of things that bless,— Dowered with such bounty that I may not guess One smallest gift which man might still bestow,— My Love hath leave to bloom in idleness, And know herself with nothing else to know. XLVI A PLEA FOR DELAY Not yet! Not yet! I dare not let thee go, Till, line for line, thy face indelible Lies printed on my heart as on a shell That gravers cut for pearl-intaglio. For one brief hour you will not grudge, I know, To let my spirit, painter-fashion, dwell Amid thy fronting lineaments, and tell All that she learns in moving to and fro. Remember, it may never chance again, In this dim world of fates lethiferal, That I alive should meet thee living too, With power to mark thy traits as now I do; And lacking these, how would my soul retain Thine image in the ways ethereal? XLVII THE DYING PRINCE He was a monarch's son, and yet he lay Racked by the latest pangs of long disease; And vainly through the lattice stole the breeze To cool his fevered forehead, where Decay Made broad her cruel image day by day; And vainly fell the shadow-gloom from trees, At whose far feet the peasant droned at ease, Rich in the sturdy health of common clay. He saw the clouds. He saw the smoke that curled From lowly cots, the leaves that flecked his floor; The peacock screamed, cocks crew, the fountain purled, And horses trampled at the castle-door; These were his tokens from the living world— The world he might not visit any more. XLVIII A DREAM OF PICTURES BY D. G. ROSSETTI One soul through many windows looking out; One face transformed in vari-coloured moods, But chiefly pale and sad, and framed about With pansies plucked where Melancholy broods; A drooping spirit strengthened but to flout Love's life-elixir; faint, which yet eludes All hands that succour; and half-dead with drought Remains enamoured of her solitudes. Alas! we may not help her. She would turn From our poor comfort, still disconsolate; Happy to be unhappy, glad to burn With torturing flame which no tear-showers abate; Yea, rapt to heaven, unblest or blest too late, In God's own presence still would yearn and yearn. XLIX AFTER TEN YEARS A league a-field with no intent of turning, (One league or twain—God knows the world is wide,) And fifty thoughts in fifty channels churning, Ten years agone my fancy loved to ride; The boy's young heart within me ever yearning For stranger-truths to homely hearts denied; There is so much that tempts us to the learning, When Health's the horse and Youth is firm astride! But Time is fleet for those who play the rover, And lengthy jaunts corrupt to weary whiles; 'Tis strange to find, now riding days are over, How great a space a little thought beguiles; Enough at noon to amble through the clover, And take the poppy-heads to mark the miles. L TO A WORKER RESIGNED The cry went forth for labourers in the field, And thou, dear child, obedient to the cry, Didst leave thy quiet home, with purpose high, To lift strange implements thou couldst not wield. Now, in the shadow of thy roof concealed, Thou sittest lonely, thinking with a sigh, Of blessèd deeds which stronger hands may try, Of sad folk comforted, of sick folk healed. Yet serve they not as well the common Lord Who from one tiny circle never roam? Doth not the glowworm on earth's humblest sward Vie with the seraph in the starry dome? Let others spread their soothing balms abroad; Thou art the angel of the church at home. LI THE END OF IT Give me your hand. The glimmering star we sought Has vanished wholly. Truth is hard to find In these fierce tournaments of mind and mind, When thought leaps out to tilt with armèd thought, And words are pierced and flung in angry sport. We have forgotten why, forgotten how We came to such rude cudgellings; and now The brawl is everything, the end is naught. Here sits no arbiter that Reason knows; And Wisdom cries, “Surrender and be mute!” I have no better friend than you,—suppose Your love should cool, as logic grows acute! Give me your hand. We will no more dispute. What boon hath strife that it should make us foes? LII IN A CHURCHYARD With Thyrsis late I walked on holy ground, And after silence at one tomb I spake: “Here lies a man whose love no scorn could shake, No toil could weary. Though dull neighbours round Observed him little as they mark this mound, His goods, time, thought, were lavished for their sake, His whole life spent in long attempt to make The world he lived in nobler than he found. And, Thyrsis, we at most can do no more: That world outweighs us with the old blind stress. Yet could we see him on the glittering shore, The sheaves he carried might exceed our guess. We keep the same great cause to labour for: Look to it, Thyrsis, that we do no less.” LIII TO ANY PAINTER Be patient; take thy coloured threads, and weave The robe of Beauty, flawless, without spot. Be humble; what the world may grant, receive, And yet for praise or guerdon lay no plot. Be sober; though thy skill should win thee leave To drain the bowl of Circé, use it not. Be thankful; knowing there are those who grieve, Because their genius has not gained thy lot. The day thou servest may not be thy day: It may not mark thee, bless thee, give thee gold Or owning all thine art's imperial sway, Refuse the lesson on thy canvas scrolled. At least, when life is over, labour done, One shall be nobler for the work of one. LIV TO AN INVALID You ask me for a charm against disease— Not of the body (you can bow to that), But of the spirit, which you tremble at, Lest it should dull your fine-wrought sympathies With vigorous human life, and slowly freeze The sinews of your mind, till they grow numb As the dead limbs they live with, and become Useless for all high purposes, like these. What is my counsel? Choose a hero. Then Make him your study,—temper, brain, and nerve, Till he has grown your stronger self. And when Weak morbid impulse comes on you to swerve From the sane path, his grafted strength shall serve To keep you true to God, your soul, and men. LV A PENITENT Enough! I choose to tell you. Priest or no, Your pity is grateful to me. Yet be sure For comfort's sake I tell you, not for cure. Sin's pang is long in lessening,—not one throe, Passed in a moment and forgotten so. Nor do I dream (for that is Hell's own lure) That we may fall, and afterwards grow pure By much repenting. Righteous we may grow, Calm, steadfast, patient, peaceful if God bless, Not pure,—not till the Last Day's trumpet-call, When the round world shall learn our guiltiness, And the maimed soul be stripped to all, that all, Seeing the scar, may guess the fall, and guess How great the Mercy which forgave the fall. LVI A PILGRIM 'Tis only perfect faith that never tires, An angel trust that murmurs, “Come what may, No fond regret shall tempt my feet to stray From the strict path of mortified desires.” Though hearts are weak, lips need not so be liars. Had there been any choice, I do not say I should have chosen this dull rugged way, This way of stones and flints, and wayside briars. What then? I grieve not, faint not. God is kind. He gives me strange sweet flowers that push between The flints,—such as no garden ever bore: And gathering these, how can I choose but mind What thankful hearts have gleaned where now I glean, What patient feet have passed this way before? LVII QUEM DI DILIGUNT O kiss the almond-blossom on the rod! A thing has gone from us that could not stay. At least our sad eyes shall not see one day All baseness treading where all beauty trod. O kiss the almond-blossom on the rod! For this our budding Hope is caught away From growth that is not other than decay To bloom eternal in the halls of God. And though of subtler grace we saw no sign, No glimmer from the yet unrisen star,— Full-orbed he broke upon the choir divine, Saint among saints beyond the golden bar, Round whose pale brows new lights of glory shine— The aureoles that were not and that are. LVIII BY A GRAVE-SIDE Here once again I stand, and once again Recall thy béauty, O belovèd face, And, O belovèd soul, thy gentle grace, Thy flower of courtesy that knew not stain. Thou art not here: yet is it sweetest pain To think of thee in this the nearest place Of earthly places to that spirit-space, Which no man sees at all except he feign. Forgive me that I may not often come To mourn thee here, who mourn where'er I go, Toiling to swell the Age's Beauty-sum, Till in the lapse of Time's eternal flow, Mine arm as thine is dead, my lips are dumb, My head beside thy head is laid a-low. LIX ON READING A POET'S “LIFE” Because he sang of pleasant paths and roses, You thought that summer joys were all his care. “The only wisdom,” so you cried, “he knows is How much delight one crowded day can bear: The reason why his verse uniquely flows is That he alone has wealth of bliss to spare: In Tempé's vale for life he gathereth posies, And flings the few he doth not keep to wear.” The veil is lifted now. Behold your singer,— A sick poor man, despised, and barely sane, Who strove awhile to shape with palsied finger The hard-wrung produce of a sleepless brain, Rich but in throes,—till Death, the great balm-bringer, Stooped down to kiss him through the deeps of pain. LX TO A MOTHER Weep not, O fond one, for thy wayward boy! This foolish world is more to blame than he, That takes the youngster on her nursing knee, And makes him 'ware of whatso gawds destroy: Then later, when he cries for some coarse toy, Loosens her doting arms and lets him free, And murmurs, “Fool! And yet I will not see. Did ever youth resist a glittering joy?” Take heart. Though there be those who never learn, Or learn too late, which is the better friend,— Thy lad, of nobler mettle, shall not spurn The love that saves while life is all to spend, But wise betimes, awake, repent, return, And bless thy patient pleading in the end. LXI TO A STRANGE TEACHER Trouble me no more. The world is very wide And full of souls whose primal faith has fled. Go first to them; and leave one simple head, Wherein the earlier teachings still abide. Why seek to fill a mouth that has not cried, To clog satiety of bread with bread? Can any hunger having richly fed? Can one be full, and yet dissatisfied? If I were wretched, you should perhaps prevail; At least I might give ear to you. But now, Because I am so happy, and because Content with life, I would be as I was, Your message moves me not. Who questions how To dig new cisterns, till the elder fail? LXII WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH I. ST. MATTHEW This form is Matthew; sometime Publican, But now God's Saint. Who having sat long while Receiving custom with no thought of guile, Honest in stewardship, albeit by man Despised, by God of place in His great plan The nations and Himself to reconcile Was held most worthy, yea of work and style Desired by angels ere the world began. For as on that bright day beside his board He counted tribute, from the city-gate Came One with strangest summons: “Follow Me.” 'Twas Jesus, named of Nazareth. And he, Knowing his life new-called and consecrate, Rose up,—the elect Historian of the Lord. LXIII WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH II. ST. MARK To Mark the second place; that Mark who erst Was kin to Barnabas and friend of Paul, And reckoned it an easy thing and small To be their yoke-fellow through lands accurst, Preaching deliverance to the tribes dispersed; Yea, and was helpful ere his faith had fall; Then taking fearfulness for Heaven's recall, Went back and walked not with them as at first; And so was lost to Paul, but not to God; Who bore him gently as a tender child, Strengthened and blest him; till with feet new-shod Again he ventured on the pagan wild, Carried the Light of lights from shade to shade, Travailed, and suffered, and was not afraid. LXIV WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH III. ST. LUKE Here standeth Luke, Physician once, and still; Healer of souls whom God delights to save; Wise-eyed in helpfulness; in pity brave; For all diseases using blessèd skill; To halt, maimed, blind, beneficent; until From town obscure by Galilean wave Flashed forth the Day-Star, born of God, and gave New life to suppliants with a sweet “I will.” At whose appearing Luke was straightly dumb, Lost in the greater Light; nor found it hard; But knelt and worshippèd; and afterward For thy monition, O Theophilus, Wrote large his gospel, and for help of us, On whom the last days of the world are come. LXV WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH IV. ST. JOHN Behold the face that Jesus loved of yore, The face of John. Long time with Zebedee He dragged his rough nets through the darkling sea; Till Jesus marked the power unmarked before, And called him from his black boat on the shore To fish for men. With zeal and lovingly He did that fisher-work, while hands were free; Then lived God's prisoner, and was blest yet more; Who on a day in Patmos knew the whirl Of spirit-wings around him, (it is writ To them that held him as Evangelist,) And saw God's City, and the walls of it— All gems, from jasper up to amethyst, With streets gold-glass, and every gate a pearl. LXVI THE TORCH-BEARER In splendour robed for some court-revelry A monarch moves when eve is on the wane. His faithful lieges flock their prince to see, And strive to pierce the gathering shade—in vain. But lo, a torch! And now the brilliant train Is manifest. Who may the bearer be? Not great himself, he maketh greatness plain. To him this praise at least. What more to me? Mine is a lowly Muse. She cannot sing A pageant or a passion; cannot cry With clamorous voice against an evil thing, And break its power; but seeks with single eye To follow in the steps of Love her King, And hold a light for men to see Him by. LXVII THE POET What is a Poet? is he one who keeps His heart remote from cares of human-kind, Tasting the rich feast of a perfect mind, Watching the shadowed Form that broods and sleeps On Fancy's breast, and drawing from her deeps New thoughts of Beauty, splendid, unconfined; Contemptuous of the common lot, and blind To the great silent crowd that toils and weeps? Ah, no! All woes that all men ever knew Lie in his soul, their labours in his hand; Yea, tear for tear, and haply tear for smile, Sin's smile, he renders them; and if some while He doth withdraw himself, 'tis but to stand Such space apart as gives the larger view. LXVIII THE ART THAT ENDURES Marble of Paros, bronze that will not rust, Onyx or agate,—Sculptor, choose thy block! Not clay nor wax nor perishable stock Of earthy stones can yield a virile bust Keen-edged against the centuries. Strive thou must In molten brass or adamantine rock To carve the strenuous shape which shall not mock Thy faith by crumbling dust upon thy dust. Poet, the warning comes not less to thee! Match well thy metres with a strong design. Let noble themes find nervous utterance. Flee The frail conceit, the weak mellifluous line. High thoughts, hard forms, toil, rigour,—these be thine, And steadfast hopes of immortality. LXIX WORDS AND THOUGHTS O words are weak! We need a stronger tongue To utter forth the heart's imaginings. Our deepest deep is full of subtle things, Things mystic, marvellous,—unsaid, unsung, Because they may not anywise be wrung Into a verbal mode. So no man brings To upper light his soul's hid travailings, Or tells what stars his spirit moves among. And yet, God knoweth, it might well be worse, (Since life is gone if all its fruits are gone,) Could we not keep, when formal thoughts disperse, Some half-revealèd shape to search and con, Some child of Fancy's children still at nurse, Some brede of Love for Love to brood upon. LXX AN APOLOGY I hold not lightly by this world of sense, So full it is of things that make me cheer. I deem that mortal blind of soul and dense, To whom created joys are less than dear. The heaven we hope for is not brought more near By spurning drops of love that filter thence: In Nature's prism some purple beams appear, Of unrevealèd light the effluence. Then count me not, O yearning hearts, to blame Because at Beauty's call mine eyes respond, Nor soon convict me of ignoble aim, Who in the schools of Life am frankly fond; For out of earth's delightful things we frame Our only visions of the world beyond. The following thirty sonnets were not included in the 1885 volume. LXXI LIFE White sails that on the horizon flash and flee, A moment glinting where the sun has shone; White billows for a moment riding free, Then gulfed in other waves that follow on; White birds that hurry past so rapidly, Albeit no sight more bright to look upon; Like you our little life; we are as ye— A moment sighted, in a moment gone. Yet not in vain, oh, not in vain, we live, If we too catch the sunlight in the air, And signal back the beauty ere we sink In that dark hollow men call death, and give To saddened souls that watch us on the brink A gleam of glory, transient but fair. LXXII TO A STUDENT It is enough, O straining Heart and strong, Enough that in thy safely-garnered store Thou hast heaped high the rich and varied lore Of dead decades. Thou dost thy scholars wrong To keep them waiting for the light so long. And nature swoons. Oh, what if nevermore The face of man looks human as of yore, And mute for thee grows melody of song? These things are more than learning; these are life. The Past is grand; but is he wise who deems All else ignoble? Spite of sound and strife, To-day is not so barren as it seems. Thou mightest know an angel in thy wife, And fair child-faces looking through thy dreams. LXXIII AT THE ISTHMIAN GAMES We crown thee, Hero, not for strength alone; That were a meed unworthy thy desert. Strength in the base is objectless, inert, Or strained to keep some passion on its throne. We crown thee rather, for that thou hast shown How fair thy prowess, and how fitly girt With laurel is the strength which does no hurt To the heart's image of ideal tone. Rough men our eyes have wondered at ere now, Who ran with wingèd feet as thou hast run; Others we know—tall youths with graceful brow Inviting wreaths of bay, yet wearing none Because their feet move sluggishly. But thou Hast given us strength and beauty joined in one. LXXIV IN THE SOPHIST'S AKADEMÊ: AN IDLER The old man babbles on. Ye gods, I swear My soul is sick of these philosophers! In sooth I marvel that young blood should care To hear such vapid stuff: yet no one stirs. Who's for a breath of unpolluted air? See yonder brown-eyed nursling of the Muse,— I'll pluck his robe and ask him; if he choose, We two can steal away and none be ware. What joy to find a woodland rill, and wade Knee-deep through pebbly shallows; then to lie With glistening limbs along the open glade, And let the soft-lipped sunbeams kiss them dry: Or wandering in the grove's remoter shade To sport and jest and talk—philosophy! LXXV THE SAME CONTINUED He will not come. Poor fool! no thought of fun Lights his dark soul—content in this drear place To spend the golden hours in fruitless chase Of witless words. How softly one by one The breezes fold their wings till day be done; The laurels droop; from out the pillar's base A grass-green lizard peeps with wrinkly face, And turns his beaded eyes toward the sun. Look east. I think god Phœbus never shone More brightly on the Mount. A molten bar Leaps from Athenê's helm as from a star, Wakes the white spirit of the Parthenon, Then dies upon the purple hills afar In flame. And still the old man babbles on. LXXVI A PHILISTINE Yestre'en while strolling through a marish dale I marked a thistle-feeding ass, and said: “Poor patient drudge, how will thy worth avail To lift thy name, while thou art thistle-fed? See, here are cytisus and galingale— Blooms of Theocritus; crop these instead: So haply may some Genius in thy head Throb gloriously and tingle through thy tail. Then would men credit thee with breadth of brain Beyond thy race, and thou 'mong all that dwell In British donkeydom shouldst bear the bell.” He paused; I showed the sacred food; in vain! His lumpish nose turned thistlewards again. “Thou wast fore-doomed,” I murmured; “fare thee well!” LXXVII A PHILOSOPHER The fire burns bright; the kettle in the grate Sends gentle music floating through the air, While Rumpelstilzchen from the easy chair Makes soft refrain. O friend, serene, sedate, Thou hast a strange capacity to bear The good and evil of a changing state; Thrice-happy thus voluptuously to fare, Yet not remorseful if unkindly Fate Appoints cold vigils in a leafless tree. Brave Stoic-epicure! Would I might win Some part of thy combined philosophy; Enjoy beatitude without a sin, Yet take my crosses kindly; live like thee, All fur without, and triple brass within. LXXVIII DEDICATION TO “THE WINDOWS OF THE CHURCH” TO MISS F. C. L. This is a tiny Book: yet here is writ An honoured name, as those who know it know. Hath blind conceit inscribed it then? Not so. Yon vane that on the steeple-top doth sit,— How small it is, how slender, weak, unfit For noble ends! But while its hand can show With faithful point which way the breezes blow, Men are content, and ask no more of it. And this my little Book is such a vane; Void in itself of strength or dignity; But set where all who choose may see it plain; And mark, O gentle Head, how constantly, In summer sunshine or through winter rain, The love-winds of my reverence tend to Thee. LXXIX A DISCIPLE SECRETLY, I One glance upon the dead face,—only one. You think it strange; but he can never know; Or with a spirit's knowledge would he shun Last look from any friend who loved him so As I have loved: in happy mood and low, In hours of grave content, in hours of fun, In mind's debate, in full heart's overflow, Through all his course, till all his course was done. What if I spake but little,—did not tell The wealth of reverence ever waxing more As he grew worthier worship? Is it well To pluck a secret from the heart's hid core,— Play thief where Self-respect as sentinel Keeps watch upon a still unopened door? LXXX A DISCIPLE SECRETLY, II Nay, surely; Love must know her times, and whom She will, confesses. Can the budding flower, When hasty fingers break it unto bloom, Match the bright offspring of a natural hour, That warmed by sun, and woke by sudden shower, Expands full-orbed? Albeit, if subtle doom Eclipse its beauty unfulfilled, no power Shall curl its petals skyward from the tomb. I did not speak. Is that a reasoned grief, Now chance of speech is gone, for ever gone? What could I give? A flower in broken leaf, A thing his eye would scarcely gaze upon, And Head had cried to Heart, “O foolish Thief To steal what should be fairly thine anon!” LXXXI DREAM-TRAVEL At night on Fancy's moon-lit main I launch my shallop, like a thief From doom of Justice fugitive, If haply I may glide and gain The land whereof sad hearts are fain, Where lotos hangs a heavy leaf, And amaranth is grown for grief, For grief that is no longer pain; And human tongues are like a tune Heard faintly through the dusk of June, As though in some unearthly grot, Where Fate and Force and Fear are not, A silver-throated choir did sing To softest note of pshawm-playing. LXXXII ISABEL: A PORTRAIT Who loves a deep face, let him look with me On this of Isabel's,—to common sight Perfect in paleness, wonderful and white, But to the studious gaze a mystery: For never calm so utter save there be A home of turbid feelings recondite, Though none shall find it in the soul's despite,— Few guess it under such tranquillity. She is a passion-flower hung overhead, That will not stoop its disc for eyes to see; A scriptured lily, ere its petals spread, Shut close until the sunshine,—so is she; Fair riddle not by all men to be read; Bright casket opening to one special key. LXXXIII THE HONEY-MOON Till dusk crept o'er the June-grass round my seat, She lay and listened, drinking word by word All the old tales of Arcady that spurred The Doric heart, and made Greek pulses beat. I could have talked for aye: it was so sweet To mark her up-turned face, while night's one bird Woke in the beech, and eve's last zephyr stirred And sighed a little, ere it sank effete. At length she rose with forehead sagely knit: “It never was,” she cried—“that age divine!” And I: “But how then could we dream of it? As well deny yon far-off tapers shine.” And so we passed to household lamps new-lit, My hand upon her shoulder, hers on mine. LXXXIV A POETASTER Of common things I treat in scanty rhymes, My verse is wrung from life's familiar prose, I hardly guess if Hippocrene still flows, 'Tis not my wit that Helicon sublimes. Like that rude peasant-lad of mythic times, I press my beanstalk with illiterate toes, Not envious of the learnèd wight who knows A lordlier stair perchance,—and never climbs. Or change the trope; my lines are coined of stuff That lay where no Scamander richly rolled. From native soil, obscure, unvalued, rough, I dig the metal for my sonnet-mould. It melts, it runs, it sparkles—'tis enough! Men call it copper: well, I dream it gold. LXXXV AN EVENING WALK At fall of night we wandered forth to muse, And arm in arm pursued the shadowy lane, Careless where Fate might lead, or Fancy choose To draw our footsteps in her silver chain. Enough to know the grandeur overhead, And feel the voiceless music of the hour, That symphony which wakes responsive power In every heart of man not wholly dead: Or even dead, what heart but lives again, Recalled to being by so sweet a strain? At times like this, the outer air is fraught With some soft spell, which moves to harmony The human soul within, till all our thought Is touched with pathos—and we know not why LXXXVI SHELLEY Some men are nature wise—yet cannot pray; Scan leaf and stone, and know not that they drink God's air at every breathing; souls that sink Whelmed in the billow while they mark the spray, Blind to the death. This man did more than they; Got faith, and travelled to the very brink Of the great world's great secret, as I think; Then losing faith, fell back, and missed his way. Happier the child who knows that God is good: He only knew that God's great work is fair. Yet he loved much, and in sublimer mood Might live and worship in that tranquil air Where all is seen, all told, all understood; Haply our mazèd souls shall meet him there. LXXXVII THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD “Behold I stand!” Who standeth? Can it be The Son of God, the Christ, the crucified, Whom thou hast all thy life contemned, denied, And thrust asunder? Yea, 'tis even He. “Behold, I stand and knock!” Where knocking? See The closèd door thick-set with thorns of pride, And choked with idle weeds from side to side; It is the door of thine impiety. “Behold, I stand and knock. If any hear My voice and open” (Foolish soul, to thee He speaketh all night long. Dost thou not fear To keep Him waiting there so wearily?), “I will come in,” (O God, my God, how near!) “Yea, and will sup with him, and he with Me.” LXXXVIII AUTUMN LEAVES How soft they fall! No fevered clutch, No frenzied prayer, no fruitless vow! They wait the doom with fearless brow: Death is not terrible to such. Thus let me die—not striving much To keep my hand upon the bough, When Fate comes near with friendly touch, And whispers, “Life is over now”; Still less receive, as loth to go, The summons with a fret or frown; But learn from this calm end to know How patient faith may fitly crown A life uncrownèd else; and so, In shade or sun, drop gently down. LXXXIX A LATE SPRING The wintry blast that chills, the frost that nips, Match well this most un-spring-like vault of grey, The sun has suffered long a cloud eclipse, And all the merriment gone out of May. Where are the blue-bells, where the cowslips, where The song of nightingales, the cuckoo's note? No voice is heard from any feathered throat, No beds of early blossom scent the air. So spake I yesterday: and, lo, this morn Unveiled a sun now blazing on to noon! The looked-for babe of vernal hope is born, And means to leap from out his cradle soon. O patient Earth, put on thy robe and sing! The skies are clear; at length, at length 'tis Spring. XC TO E. C. P. You do me wrong, my friend. I never said That fault of heart is screened by charm of face, Or bade you look for love, then take instead A thin veneer of superficial grace. I did but amplify a common thought, That light without is born of flame within, That pure and noble lines of feature ought To image forth a soul unmarred by sin. There is a formal beauty all of earth, A poor deceptive thing of little worth; Of that I spake not. To the Poet's eye One God illumes all good since Time began; The rest he looks on but in passing by To realise the perfect type of man. XCI ADVICE If I were you, with health and youth in touch— Great gifts at hand, and greater gifts in store, I would not, for the much, forget the more, I would not, for the more, neglect the much. Be rich to-day; but while to-day you clutch The fruit which yesterday your hands forbore, Bethink you of the days that stretch before, And spare the seed which shall be fruit for such. Not all to spend, nor all to save, is best; To have, to hope; to enjoy, and still pursue; To climb awhile, and then awhile to rest; To love the old, and yet acclaim the new; And “Good the goal” should be my creed confest, If I were you, dear lad,—if I were you! XCII SIBYL'S HAND There are five fingers in a hand, I think; And Sibyl's hand hath neither less nor more: To wit, a thumb, a common thumb, and four Well ordered digits fleshed in white and pink, As other digits are. Yet when I link My hand in hers, as daily in a score Of hands I link it, steals through every pore A strange sweet feeling not with pen and ink Definable,—so strange indeed and sweet That I can scarce quit hold. Now tell me pray, Good friends discreet of soul,—when next we meet And Sibyl smiles, which is the better way— Shall I refuse the hand stretched out to greet, Or clasp and keep it ever and a day? XCIII SAINTS O Saints, dear Saints, so present, yet so far! I cannot touch you with my hand, or trace The aspect of your strength, your faith, your grace; Between us lie the years,—the gulf, the bar. But as one tracks the starlight to the star, And finds no dark nor flame-forsaken space To fret the beauty of its burning face, Because the splendour swallows blot and scar; So Time has framed you with an aureole More circle-rounded than your age foreknew; No frailty now can quench that fire of soul! The things ye willed, and did not, those ye do; The gifts ye strove for, in my sight are true; Your perfect parts have made perfection whole. XCIV ON A DULL DOG This dog was dull. He had so little wit That other dogs would flout him, nose in air. But was he therefore wretched? Did he care How dogdom snarled, or even think of it? He thought of nothing, but all day would sit Warm in the sun, with placid vacant stare, Content, at ease, oblivious, unaware; And all because—he had so little wit! O happy dulness which is dull indeed, And cannot hear the critic-world's “Go hang!” Small bliss we get from our too-conscious breed, We semi-dullards of the middle gang! To mark the rose, and know one's-self a weed, And know that others know,—there lies the pang! XCV THE CARPET-WEAVER Lived once a carpet-weaver, poor in purse But rich in love for all things fair, and all That lift the soul. Hard fortune! Did he curse The sordid Fates that bound him to the stall? He reared his booth against the temple wall, Marked every day the wreathèd crowds disperse, Heard flute and tabor and the doves' low call And wove meanwhile his carpets—think you, worse? We may not all be temple-slaves of Art; The world has ruder work for you, for me. Yet so God lets us toil that, pure in heart, We dimly guess what happier eyes can see; What happier lips can sing is ours in part, If we keep time with their sweet minstrelsy. XCVI FAITH AND LOVE The darkened chamber held the maiden dead. Her name was Faith. Of long neglect she died. And now men rose and shook themselves and cried, “O Faith, come back,—come back ere Hope be fled!” But she lay silent on her solemn bed, And men grew piteous at their prayer denied; They said “No more is man to man allied; We fall asunder—and the world,” they said. And while they talked, behold a gracious form, And Love beside the pillow bending low: “We live and die together, she and I.” So then he kissed her, and her flesh grew warm; She woke and faced them with a ruddy glow. If Love be living, Faith can never die. April 1891. XCVII REVERENCE Behold, and touch not; worship, and refrain. Kneel in the outer court, nor hotly bring Too near the Radiance thy frail offering, Which is thyself. Fond heart, what couldst thou gain By creeping closer? Nay; let be; remain; Between thy love and the Belovèd thing Keep still a space for rapt imagining, Lest languor seize thee, and a subtle pain. Thou art a man. Be human and content. Not thine to breathe a supersensual air Or snatch the heart of bliss. Thy joys are lent To teach thee how to greet them and to spare: As some grey prophet with his head low bent Will give to Beauty blessing—all he dare. April 1891. XCVIII THE BEST ANSWER Say on. You know how dead-alive I am. Some men would wince to see their idols flung From dim-lit darkness where so late they hung, And turned adrift for jeers, and labelled “sham.” But I (you know me), mild as any lamb, Give up my heroes to your slashing tongue, Give up my martyrs to be burned and hung, And keep my lips, and bless not, if you damn. And when at length the wordy storm has waned, Still bright the sky! The rifted clouds reveal The same unchanging sun. Two things are gained. My heart is tempered to a firmer steel, And your true self comes out to soothe and heal. But since you stirred me not, I am not pained. April 1891. XCIX RATAPLAN “O Rataplan! It is a merry note, And, mother, I'm for 'listing in the morn;” “And would ye, son, to wear a scarlet coat, Go leave your mother's latter age forlorn?” “O mother, I am sick of sheep and goat, Fat cattle, and the reaping of the corn; I long to see the British colours float; For glory, glory, glory, was I born!” She saw him march. It was a gallant sight. She blest herself, and praised him for a man. And straight he hurried to the bitter fight, And found a bullet in the drear Soudan. They dug a shallow grave—'twas all they might; And that's the end of glory. Rataplan! April 1891. C THE INQUISITOR Yes, pain is grievous; argumentum stat. But not so frightful as the flames of—well, You know. And by compare, as schoolmen tell, These pangs are scarce the stinging of a gnat. Besides, we have the Church's mandate—flat! “Compel them to come in,”—I say—“compel!” Now if through naughtiness the flesh rebel, And need sharp goading, dare we shrink from that? No, no; last week a heretic we tried Who much annoyed us, being obstinate Beyond the measure of his kind. We plied All engines; for his sin was great. Then I took unction just before he died And sent him pardoned through St. Peter's gate. April 1891.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LYRICAL POEMS AT LYNMOUTH Sunny sky o'er sunny sea, Tiny waves that ripple in, Where beside the little quay Rattles down the noisy Lyn; Rugged rocks that overhead Blend and blazon every hue, Glowing purple, blushing red At the sea's diviner blue; Did your pencil ever paint, Any picture half as quaint, Half as lovely, half as sweet, Marguerite? Deep sequestered, tree-begirt, In the vale the village sleeps, Fenced around and screened from hurt By the crag-surmounted steeps; Under eaves white roses smile, Gable-high the fuchsia climbs, Ruddy-tinted roofs of tile Peep from out the leafy limes; Of all Edens 'neath the sun, Found or fancied, is there one More enchanting, more complete, Marguerite? Let us wander hand in hand Out of shadow into light, View the beauties of the land From this bare unwooded height; Hill and valley, rock and rill, All in rich profusion lie, Rock and river, vale and hill Stretched before the dazzled eye; Could the storied Isles of Bliss Shew a scene as fair as this Here unfolded at our feet, Marguerite? Now descending let us pass Far from sight and sound of men, Where the fern and scented grass Carpet soft the shaded glen; Where the river in its flow, Leaping down with merry glee, Finds a sister stream, and, lo! Greets and bears her to the sea. Lovely spot! who would not stay, Learning all the live-long day Lessons from this “waters-meet,” Marguerite? July 1876. AUTUMN LEAVES O leaflets, old and brown and sere, It is full time to quit your bough; The autumn visage of the year Is frowning on you even now. Farewell! How sad the tale ye tell Of summer past we know not how,— Bright minutes fled beyond recall, And scarcely used, if used at all! The northern breeze will thin your crown, And cut the laggards with his knife; Contending blasts will hurl you down, The victims of their windy strife. Frail things! And yet from death forth-springs The promise of another life; Your very selves in altered guise Again shall smile to sunny skies. October 1876. TO A MAIDEN WHO WISHES TO DRESS A LA MODE O let me love thee as thou art, Not as thou mayest be, If twenty toilet-tricks impart A fancied grace to thee. So many simple charms are blent Beneath that witching eye, The soul that is not thus content Is hard to satisfy. And wherefore try such doubtful ways? What dost thou seek to gain? To bind a lover in whose gaze Each other maid is plain? If all the nymphs of Gaul combine To deck thee with their store, My heart's already wholly thine, I cannot give thee more. Then ever leave such borrowed plumes To birds that doubt their own, Assured that she is blest who blooms With nature's grace alone. Thou least of all hast need to boast A loveliness suborned; The beauty which entrances most Is beauty unadorned. October 1876. ODE On a prospect (not distant) of being ploughed a second time O Plough, it is long since I met you, So cruelly keen in the “schools,” But still I could never forget you, “Forget” is the tonic of fools. Ah, then I was youthful and tender, And yours was a terrible name; If my knowledge of grammar was slender, I still kept a feeling of shame. Afresh you would like to make tingle Every nerve in my system: in vain! Your triumph is over,—'twas single; You cannot enjoy it again. To-day I am tougher and older, My freshness has vanished, and now, With a back that is hard as a boulder, I laugh at your malice, O Plough! November 1876. TO AMARYLLIS I love thee with a love so deep And in its depth so strong, Its spells transmute life's thorns to fruit, And sorrows into song. For Beauty dead I could not weep, She cannot die to me; I love thee with a love so deep, So strong my love for thee. I love thee with a love so rich, That in its charm so rare, E'en Midas' self had left his pelf, And for thy sake gone bare; And yet not bare with half a niche In Eros' fane near thee; I love thee with a love so rich, So rare my love for thee. I love thee with a love so true, And in its truth so tried, That ere it pale life's force must fail, Or Time roll back his tide. By slow degrees the sapling grew, Not quickly bends the tree; I love thee with a love so true, So tried my love for thee. I love thee with a love that is The best of loves that are,— A lustrous stone, which shines alone 'Mid lesser lights a star; A star that adds to very bliss Another glint of glee;— I love thee with a love like this,— O what's thy love for me? January 1877. RONDEAUS IN THE MANNER OF MR. AUSTIN DOBSON I When Phillis frowns, an ugly blight Descends where all before was light, Steals o'er the sunshine of her face, And quite eclipses half the grace Wherewith the queenly maid is dight. Her faëry guards in very fright Unfold their wings, and take to flight; Creatures of earth and air give place, When Phillis frowns. I may not—would not, if I might,— Behold at large the woeful sight. Let Nature's healing sleep efface Unlovely lines in soft embrace: Sweet Day, adieu! Come, gentle Night, When Phillis frowns! II O Love, how fair thou art to-day— I would thy face were so alway! O Love, how fair thou art; and yet How apt, O Love, to play coquette, As if the part were sweet to play. At times as bright and blithe and gay As ripples in the coral bay,— Without foreboding or regret,— O Love, how fair! At times; but 'tis not always May, And when thy votaress, Miss A. Makes up with him for whist a set, Or trills with him the soft duet, 'Tis not so easy then to say, “O Love, how fair!” III To see His face is all her prayer;— To see His face,—no matter where: The sight of e'en the faintest trace Would glorify a desert-place, And make the wilderness look fair. The heaviest burden Love could share, The direst peril Love would dare, If only for a little space To see His face. Not yet, not here; Sweet soul, forbear To fret for one beyond thy care. With hope assured, take heart of grace; The wheels of Time roll on apace; When death comes nigh, look up, prepare To see His face. IV Forget-me-not! How Nature rears Emblems of human hopes and fears Under our feet! See where they grow, The tiny flowers that lovers know. And fame of old romance endears. We part to-night! the moment nears; Here is a blossom dewed with tears. Reject it,—well! Accept, and so Forget me not! Either let fate produce the shears, And nip the bond that disappears; Forget me now before you go,— Or take the gift my hands bestow, And then, through all the length of years Forget me not! May 1878. THE DEAD POET Blow the trumpet loud and clear; Blow, and yet 'tis somewhat late. Could the sound have reached his ear, His had been a happier fate. While we had him, what his guerdon? Wormwood rendered for his song, Till he sank beneath the burden,— You have waited over-long. Gold and glory heaped for many, Not a kindly word for him; Ah! he would have blessed a penny, When the light of life was dim. Words that might have cheered, unspoken, Shouted now, but all in vain; If the silver cord be broken, Is it ever joined again? Call him noble, call him brave, Call him genius, if you will; But to call him from his grave Far transcendeth all your skill. May 1878. VALEDICTORY TO H. M. H. Farewell! you pass to western lands Across the weary waste of sea, In heart aglow with eager hands To seize the life which is to be. Amid the work you go to find Upon that other busy shore, You may not often bring to mind The finished course that went before. But we at home shall oft recall A love in deed so firm and true, And if you think of us at all, So think as we shall think of you. At last return when life is low, And find a corner vacant yet In hearts that loved long years ago, And never will, or can, forget. IS IT SO? Is it so? Yester-eve, did you say, He was taken away, Without semblance of mercy or ruth In the bloom of his youth, Away from the hopes and the fears Of young passionate years, And the promise of strength as he grew To his prime—is it true? Very hard it must seem to the man With a cut-and-dried plan Of creation, which quite supersedes All the time-honoured creeds, And allots to each being a sphere Which is pleasantly clear While he holds his own place in the rank;— If he dies, there's a blank. But to you who are not narrow-brained Does it seem unexplained, Unsolved, like a riddle, this end, This death of our friend? Oxford. HEROISM: A THOUGHT Thou wouldst be Hero? Wait not then supinely For fields of fine romance which no day brings The finest life lies oft in doing finely A multitude of unromantic things. The heroism of thy true endeavour Shall gild the common-place of common days, And God Himself shall guard thy work for ever, And crown it with eternity of praise. O LOVE, O LOVE, HOW LONG? The tree that yearns with drooping crest O'er some deep river's tranquil breast At length grows downward, and is blest— O Love, O Love, how long? Belated birds at set of sun Go sailing homeward one by one, For sweets are earned when toil is done— O Love, O Love, how long? The creeper through the tangled maze Of brushwood following lightless ways Shall some day reach the unclouded rays— O Love, O Love, how long? The barque that strains with groaning mast Though troubled seas and skies o'ercast Shall sight the wished-for port at last— O Love, O Love, how long? The traveller spent by many a mile Plods grimly on, yet knows the while That all will end in one fond smile— O Love, O Love, how long? The hope of pleasure softens pain, And if by suffering men attain, A present loss is future gain— O Love, O Love, how long? SONG O careful out of measure To fence your lovely treasure With prudence unavailing From what must surely be, How quick you scent a danger From any comely stranger Who leans upon a railing, Or lurks beneath a tree! Then close the blind demurely, And lock the door securely, And lest a fraud should happen, Be watchful of the key; But O you may be certain That Love will draw the curtain, And throw the casement open, And look abroad to see. And if the Fates be kindly, And manage not too blindly, Young Love will hatch a treason, And struggle to be free; And though you may not guess it, Nor any sign confess it, The lips you think in prison Will be kissing on the lea. LOVE'S DELAY They sat—they two—upon the cliff together, And watched the moonlight dance along the swell, Till broke upon their pleasance 'mid the heather The midnight warning of the village bell. “Good night, my love,” he said; “we pass the measure Of blessing which in one day's lap can lie; To linger later were to weary Pleasure, And draw some brightness from Tomorrow's eye.” They rose, and gave a last fond look at ocean, And then another, and again one more, And lingering thus, at every homeward motion They noted some delight unseen before. So waned the Night; and when young Morn upstarted And quenched pale Luna's lamp with ruddier glare, He found them parting yet, and yet unparted,— Still pledged to move, and still love-anchored there. DON'T YOU THINK—? Don't you think that if a torrent, Rushing on its seaward way, Found a jewel lying softly On its bed of primal clay, It would seize and bear it onward, Smiling with a smile of spray? Don't you think that any zephyr With a spirit of its own, If it met a little cloudlet Idling where no wind had blown, Quick would clasp it,—quite refusing Any more to fly alone? Don't you think that Love the Torrent, Love the Zephyr, whereso'er It shall meet a soul untrammelled, Happy, free, and debonair, Can and will and must embrace it, All eternity to share? THE PAGE I “Room for Her Highness, ladies gay! Gentlemen-ushers, clear the way!” A flourish of trumpets makes known to all That Madame de Bourbon will open the ball. With stately mien, and paces slow, Up to the daïs the courtiers go, But what is the creature that strives amain To carry the weight of the royal train? Is it an imp in human shape, Or a stunted kind of hairless ape? Surely it beggars the best of eyes To follow a form in such disguise. Look at him well, and then confess That if, as they say, the art of dress Is the power to hide, there can't be room For any reform in yon costume. A tunic of red with golden lace, A collar that seems to fence his face, A velvet pelisse of sapphire blue And a monster rosette on either shoe; Fettered with ribands; condemned to wear A wig of somebody else's hair, A necklace of gems as large as eggs, And a sword that is always between his legs; More than monkey, and less than man— There never was seen, since Time began, Such a queer grotesque, I dare engage, As Madame de Bourbon's youngest page. II The ball is over: with aching head The poor little page steals off to bed, And stripped of the velvet and gold brocade Is simply the boy that God has made. Sleep sound, tired fellow! Sweet dreams be yours Of the château away on the Gascon moors; Of the father, so stern and yet so true, Of the mother whose prayers are all for you; Of the dear little Marie you long to kiss, And the sturdy limbs of young Narcisse; Of Léon the hound, polite and tame, But ever agog for sport or game; Of Jacquot the pony you once could ride At your own free will o'er the country-side;— Till the sun looks in through the window-pane, And you lose your boyhood over again. COLORES A MOAN AFTER MOON-SET A parody of Mr. Swinburne's style as exemplified in “Dolores” O thou that art sanguine and subtle, With fingers so wicked and white, And eyes that are black as a cuttle, And brows that are blue as a blight. O terriblest torture invented! O purplest passion intense! (Have you heard of a poet demented, Benign Common-sense?) O love that is redder than roses! O hate that is whiter than snow! That blinkedly blindedly blazes, When black-blooded blast-blisses blow; Desert us, disdain us, O never! Still fashion our fatuous fate; O lick us and kick us for ever, Red love and white hate! Let thy crying out-crimson the poppy, Thy yellings out-yellow the moon All gilt with the gold of her copy While thy moanings are simply maroon; Let the robe of thy redness be rounded, And the doom of desire be dense; (Let the meaning of this be expounded, Say I, Common-sense.) By the foam and the froth and the flashes, The flashes, the froth and the foam, By the crag-cradled craving and crashes Through globulous glimmering gloom, By the red, by the redder, the reddest, The greenest, the greener, the green, By the folly that feeds where thou feddest, And licks thy plate clean. By the fin-smashing fists that have smitten The bruises that blacken and bud, By the tawny-tailed cur that has bitten When the thong has come down with a thud, By all that is cruel and crimson, By all that is mean and immense, (In a word, by the horrors he hymns on, Benign Common-sense.) Who shall say whether red is ecstatic, Or green a more furious hue? Must it always remain problematic Whether passion is purple or blue? Sea-serpents sequestered in sadness, That satiate sorrow with salt, O read us this riddle of madness, Since we are at fault! So the saffron shall simulate sable, The bluest and blackest shall blend, All the bases shall build them a Babel, Red, blue, green,—and so on to the end. (Ye bards that make Bedlam your model, Remove your absurdities hence! Come down and redeem us from twaddle, Benign Common-sense!) Oxford, 1876. LOOKING BACK We walked in June thro' garden beds Made bright with every flower that blows, And high above their dewy heads A rose, and yet again a rose. They bent to meet you from the stem, You touched their petals as we passed; (No gentler hand could fall on them) “Sweet things,” you murmured,—“while they last. And I on cheerful thoughts intent: “How well they grace their tiny room! Without a struggle yielding scent, Without an effort spreading bloom. And why should we so toil to please, When simple truth is all in all? What can we compass more than these?” You smiled and said, “But ah, they fall!” November glooms are round us now, I sit within and dream of you— Your look, your smile, your thoughtful brow, Your pensive word—alas, 'twas true! The fairest thing makes shortest stay, The sweetest thing the soonest goes; Shed were the rose's leaves to-day, And you—you went before the rose! 1884. “LORD, AND WHAT SHALL THIS MAN DO?” O Lord, Thy wisdom leads us best To where our duties lie; Thou giv'st without perturbing quest The light to find them by. And if our hearts would fain be told, For self or dearest friend, What doom in God's high book is scrolled, What work His love shall send; Let this thought be for comfort—not To Peter, not to John, Was told the fulness of the lot That years were leading on. To one a glimpse was given, no more, In dark prophetic show,— To one not then imperious, nor Importunate to know. And he to whom a little while Would bring that vision fair, Heard not as yet of Patmos' Isle, And what should greet him there. But feed My sheep, the Saviour said, Disciple, follow Me! In My pure footsteps meekly tread,— The rest is not for thee! And so to us the warning comes, When faith is tossed at sea,— The simple word of trust which sums True Love's philosophy. Hereafter lies with God—enough! Our path begins from here; Our next step, be it smooth or rough, Our Master maketh clear. No hearts with sacred love elate, Whose lamps are burning still, Can linger in such vexed estate As not to know His will. Our shades shall never lie so deep, Our landscape grow so dim, That we need fail to feed His sheep, Or cease from following Him.</field>
