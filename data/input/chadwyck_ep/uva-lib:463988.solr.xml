Ande Dyomedes byrdes Ã¾ai ware Callit thare-eftre mony a ?here; He tellis als amange Ã¾e laiff That (Ã¾ai) of kynde gud knawlege haue Quhilk is a mane of latyne lande Besyde a grek, ande Ã¾ai hyme fande; Tharfor Ã¾e grekes Ã¾ai luf &amp; kene, Ande ay eschewis fra latyne mene. Bot quhethire Ã¾is be suth or noutht, It is doutouse to mannes thought.â Now to our text agane we ga, That one Ã¾is maner tellys sa: That, while Jasone &amp; Hercules Ine Symonent Ã¾ame restande wes Ande dyde no-thinge bot ete &amp; drank Ande payit Ã¾arfor with mekle thank: Of Ã¾ar affere come tythinge Sone to Lleamedone Ã¾e kinge: That syk strangeres ine hys cuntre War cummyne, for to spye ande see The pryvateis of hys kynrykâ Till vthire thinges it was notht lykâ So Ã¾at thay mytht with staluart hande Repare agayne and stroye Ã¾e lande. For Troye was notht ine-to Ã¾at tyde Be ferre sa mekile ne sa wyde As eftre Ã¾e syrst distructioune, Quhene Pryame biggyt agane Ã¾e toune.

Ande quhene he come befor thame twa, Ine the presence of mony ma That with hyme (come) fra Ã¾e Cite, Hys message Ã¾us pronowncyt he: Â»Leamedone, Ã¾at aw Ã¾is lande As kynde lorde all-weldande, Of ?oure commynge has gret ferly: That ?e enterit so sodanly To sogeourne here ine hys cuntre With-out leue of hys Ryalte. For hys entent is ande hys will Ine pece to kepe hys kynryk still.

Me lest no langare soiourne here.Â« Quhane he hade endyt one Ã¾is wise Thyre wordes as I here devise, Thane to Ã¾e messynger ine hye He turnyt ande saide hyme semblely: Â»The affecte of thy message, frende, We haue consauit welle to ende; Ande Ã¾e fare gyftes, to ws sent As gentryce walde, be our entent We haf ressauit ine the maner As skill walde Ã¾ai ressauit were. Bot at our goddes neuirtheles We tak wytnesse of suthfastnes That we come neuir ine purpos here ?our kingis lande to stroye no stere, Ne to do wrange ne wiolence, Ne yhit to do Ã¾e peple offence, Bot one our wayage furth to pas Ine gude pece, as our purpos was, Ine othyr landis, quhar Ã¾at we With help of gode ritht sone may be; And Ã¾oth we come ine-to Ã¾is stede, We hade no motyf bot of nede, Thrutht contrare wynde &amp; wedderis wode That draf ws hydder attour Ã¾e flode.

Thane Jasone but langar delay Callit Phylotes ande couth hyme say That he ger ankeres rasit be Ande smertly set thame to Ã¾e see; Ande Phylotes ritht wondre sone, As Jasone bade, belyf has done. Thare harnes all to schype Ã¾ai bare That Ã¾ai for eese hade landit thare. Thai walde fane Ã¾at Ã¾ai my? haf wro? Some skaith, or Ã¾ai to see hade southt: Bot Ã¾ai war notht of syk powere, For-quhy to few of folk Ã¾ai were. In-to Ã¾ar schype sone enteryt Ã¾ai; The wynde was gude, Ã¾ai went Ã¾ar way, And sone Ã¾e cost of Frygea With craft of course Ã¾ai saillit fra. And throw mytht of Ã¾ar goddes gret Be contrare wedder thame to thret, A likande wynde thame sett to lande At Colkas softly one Ã¾e sande. Quhar Ã¾ai Ã¾ar shype gert hastely (Be) herbreyt at oportunyte Right happely ine hawynnynge gudeâ So fayrly Fortune with thame ?hude.â How Jason and Hercules enterit in the Ile of Colkas. Thus ine Colkas, the nobile Ile, Is enterit Jasone, the gentile, With hys falow, schyr Hercules. Ine-to Ã¾at Ile Ã¾at tyme Ã¾ar was A fare Cite, baith ryche &amp; witht: Jaconites Ã¾ai callit it rytht; It wes Ã¾e cheef of Ã¾at kynrik, For Ã¾ar was othyre nane it lyk Of mekilnes ande of bewte, With towris ande wallis fare to se; Castellis ande palais mony one Ã¾ar-ine was wrought of marbile-stone; The stretis ware strautht &amp; wynly maide, Ritht lufly, bath lange &amp; brade; The housses in the frount before All of a hight, baith lesse &amp; more, With fannys ande banneres wpone hight Aboue standande, of golde so bright:â Baith lordis ande marchantes of renowne Hade Ã¾ar thare habitacioune, With mony ryche rentis &amp; feis â As it efferis for syk Citeis. Ine this Cite, Ã¾at I of telle, That tyme Oethes kynge couth duelle Rytht ryally with hys barowns: Dukis of gret possessions, And Erlis, Ã¾at war mekle of my?, With othire mony nobile knytht, That with hyme Ã¾at tyme soiournyt Ã¾are. For nere-hande by Ã¾e Cite ware Fare forestis ande parkis wyde; Ande of huntynge Ã¾at ilk tyde As I tell, was Ã¾e sessoune sette With syk delitis to Intremett; Ande for Ã¾ai woddys warnyst were Ine-to haboundance of wylde dere, It wes Ã¾e cause wherfore Ã¾e kynge llay Ã¾ar as Ã¾ane ine soiournynge. Thare was alsua about Ã¾e toune Without Ã¾e wallis enwyroune A playne ritht fare, ewine ande braide; Ande ine it for delyt war maide ?ardes for herbys ande for virgerys, That fruyt ine grew of sere maneris; Fresche wellis fare &amp; suet spryngande, Ande byrdes one Ã¾e trees syngande, That Ã¾idderwarde maide Ã¾ar repare For suetnes of Ã¾at nobile ayre. Fra Ã¾e wellis of wattere clere The stryndes ine dyuerse places were Rynnande throw gravaile quhyt &amp; clene; Whar-throw Ã¾e herbis quhyt &amp; grene Maide moistour ay ine ilk sessoune, As hevine-gevine Inundacioune, That is to say: quhene Ã¾e suet rane Of out descendis o(ne) hill ande plane And fresche ande wele flowande flude Reconfortis all grene growande gude, As cornys, treys, herbys ande fruyttis, Throw course of kynde &amp; sindry suyttis, To mannys delitt, as gode throw grace Has grauntyne ws ine dyuerse place. For thar delittis, as I herde are, Wyld fowlis feill reparit thare, As of Ryvere ande vthyr kynde As ine syk places mene may fynde. Quhar-throw of halkinge ande of huntinge Haboundanly thar hade Ã¾e kynge: The quhilk gaue hyme occasioune That tyme to soiourne ine-to Ã¾at toune.â To Ã¾is Cite, as I ?ow say, Come Jasone ine with ryche aray, With hercules ande Ã¾ar men?he, Ilk mane arayit ine Ã¾ar degre. The quhilk, quhene Ã¾ai come throw Ã¾e streteâ That was to see one fare &amp; suete, One baith Ã¾e sydys so sembly maide, llevalyt ine lyk, with frountys braide: Thai likinge hade Ã¾ar-one to luk; Rytht ewyne pacys Ã¾ar way Ã¾ai tuk. Thar movinge was so mesurably That Ã¾e commowns hade gret ferly Of sa buyrly a companye Ande ferlyit one thame gretumly:â Thai saw sa mony kynglyk wede And sa fayr folk ine thar ?outhede Ine flurysande as of ane elde. Thay stude ande thame hertly byheldeâ So stalwart ine-to Ã¾ar passynge, Thare contynance ande Ã¾ar steringe, And so fayr thewis cane appere Ine thame, Ã¾at Ã¾ai one wonderit sere; The commowns, as Ã¾ai one thame gowyt, Attour all thinge Ã¾ar hawynge lowyt.

And as thyre forsaide bestes were Lleyde to be brent one the altere, And to thame fyre put, forto mo Thys sacrifice: myraculis two Hapnede amonges thame sodeynly.

The tothyre myrakle Ã¾us was kyde: That, whene Ã¾e Inwarde bowelles were Of Ã¾e bestes, we seyde of ayere, Grathede &amp; leyde one Ã¾e altere To sacrifice, one Ã¾are maner: One herne, out of the ayere fleande, Inne clamour of Ã¾e voice sownande Ryght sodeynly descendet Ã¾ar Ande russhande wpone Ã¾e altare With hys ryvande ande sharpe tallons, That for to se war rytht fellons, The forsayde bowelles euerychone He tok, ande syne away is gone, Inne-to Ã¾e shippes but abayde Of the gregeois ine hast Ã¾ame hade.

The port, forsooth, of the Cite Was nought of so gret quantyte The horss myght entre gaynandly. One nede they huffyt it (!) for-thy To brek Ã¾e wall one eueryche syde Ande the port als to mak it wyde, And of the hight to brek also, Whill Ã¾at Ã¾are (!) myght entre Ã¾are mo. Thys done, troyiens ine Ã¾is Citeâ Was nought of so gret quantyteâ Whene opene maide was Ã¾e entre, They dressede thame, as best myght be, They drew Ã¾e horss with moche Joye Withine Ã¾e gret Cite of Troye. For it is nought new certanly Ilast Joye Ã¾at sorow occupye:â Sene Ã¾at Ã¾e troyiens cyte?anis Ande Ã¾e grettest of thame certanys Of blynde wachingis blynde ware maide, Nought Ã¾e horss Ã¾e drawynge hade, Ã¾ought Ã¾at Ã¾e dedys as of Ã¾e corps Statut lyknes of ane horss, But errare of thame of Ã¾at stede Inne hys bowalles to dolfull dede That Impressede, Ã¾e sooth to say,â As kende was eftre by assay. Inne-to Ã¾is sayde horss of gret fame The gregeois put ane, to name Hate Symeone, the whome they thare The keyes of this horss he bare (!)

The gregeois gylfully Ã¾at day Seyde to Pryame Ã¾at pas walde Ã¾ai To Thenadone all holely, Whare they hade statut, pryvely For to receyve Ã¾e queene Eleyne, For they drede gretly ine-to certeyne That, gif ine Troye ressauit war scho, For anny thynge Ã¾at they myght do Scho walde be put to felloune dede, That none Ã¾are-ine myght set remede, Whene noyse ine-to Ã¾e oost so ryse She ware ressauit one syk wyse. It plesede to Pryame Ã¾e kynge, As wnwittande Ã¾ar purposinge, Of Ã¾e gregeois falss spekynges, Thame reputande leile ine-to all thingis. Wherfore ascendande Ã¾e gregeois Thar shippes with gret myrth &amp; noyse, Ande saylede one frome Troyes stronde, All hole Ã¾e troyiens thame seande, That Ã¾ar-of war rytht wondre blyth. At Thenadone the Gregeois swyth Aryvede weill with all Ã¾are thynge A litill foroweth Ã¾e evynnynge, And slepede Ã¾are ine gret blythnes. And whene of the nyght Ã¾e myrknes Was one commyne, one Ã¾are best wyse Inne Ã¾are armoure they thame warnyse, And ine gret scylence of the nyght To the Cite of Troye went ryght. Quhen e Symeon persavede wele The troyiens all euire-ilk deill One slepe and all the toune pryve, Inne hye of hys horss ysshede he, The stekynges oppynnede, ande syne Ã¾e fyre He gert ascende byrnnande full schyre, Ande so to gregeois one commande The tokene gave, was awenande. That ine-contynent thrught Ã¾e wall Of the brokyne port entrede all; Ande Ã¾e knyghtes out commande Ã¾are Of the horss, whare ine stedede ware, One Ã¾e troyiens russhede rigorously, That ine Ã¾ar Innes, sekyrly, Inne-to Ã¾are beddes lay slepande, Of syk assawtes not dredande. The gregeois apone ilk syde The ?attes felonly Ã¾at tyde Of Ã¾are Innes brok ande full sone Inne-to Ã¾ar Innes entrede but hone And slew all thame, they Ine fonde, Rytht na discrecioune havande Of oulde folk, barnys, nore wyffes, That they felly reft heme Ã¾e lyffes; And all Ã¾are ryches preciouse, They fonde ine byggynge or ine house, They exponyt ine reffe ande praye Ande preciouse thynges all hade away.

The clamoure gret was ine Ã¾e toune Of Ã¾e gret occisioune Of woices of thame deande, Inne tyme gregeois war sleyande. Ande whene kinge Pryame sodeynly So gret clamour herde, &amp; crye, He wyst ine hye ine-to Ã¾at cace Of Anthenore ande Eneas Hyme traytourly to be bytradyt; For-thy of hys bede he hyme rasyt, Inne-to hys thought full rytht angry Ande (in) of teres full gret copye, Ande ine hys clothes sone hyme clede That he fonde redy ine-to Ã¾at stede, And syne descendede sodeynly Of hys chalmeres all anerly Ande ine the tempile Appolyne, That was stondynge hys palaas Ine, He entrede, wenande but remede Of hys foes sone to be dedeâ For of hys lyf all hope away Frome hyme excludede was for ay.
