      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION. You ask me, Dear! what perfect thing I find in all my wandering These ancient Sanskrit scrolls amid, Where India's deepest heart is hid? Nothing, I answer, half so wise As one glance from your gentle eyes! Nothing so tender or so true As one word interchanged with you! Because, two souls conjoined can see More than the best philosophy. Yet, wise and true and tender lore Waits him who will those leaves explore, Which, plucked from palm or plantain-tree, Display, in Devan√¢gari, The grand, sonorous, long-linked lines Wherethrough that ‚ÄúLight of Asia‚Äù shines. And you have asked; so I obey, Hastening upon your knees to lay This lovely lotus-blossom, grown Long ere our Mary's Rose was blown; This pearl of hope, fetched from the sea Before they fished at Galilee! For thus, I think, your kindest eyes May read deep truth with glad surprise. The subtle thought, the far-off faith, The deathless spirit mocking Death, The close-packed sense, hard to unlock As diamonds from the mother-rock, The solemn, brief, simplicity, The insight, fancy, mystery Of Hindoo scriptures‚Äîall are had In this divine Upanishad. I read it in my Indian days. Beyond our city, where the ways Parted‚Äîfor Looni and Kirk√Æ‚Äî A hill, steep-sloping you might see. It rises from the river's bank, And all its sides are green and rank With spear-grass, bamboo, cactus, thorn; And bright with fragrant blossoms, borne By neem and baubul; and the air Sighs cool across a prospect fair Of Deccan villages and fields, Where the dark soil rich tribute yields Of pulse and millet. Farther back, ?ivaji's mountains, flat and black, Fold round the plain. Upon that hill There stood (I think it stands there still!) A little shrine, in ancient days Built by a Sett to Siva's praise; Milk-white it glimmered through the green, Save that upon its gate was seen A blood-red hand impressed, and, near, The three-fold mark to Siva dear. Sacred and placid was the place, With cool, smooth walls, and slender grace Of domed roof, and a peepul tree, And platform of hewn masonry, Whereto the distant city's hum Came soft, with broken beats of drum Which did not mar the solitude; For all around that temple cooed The creamy doves; striped squirrels leaped From stem to stem, the musk-rat peeped Under the wall; beside the porch Flamed the red lizard like a torch Flung on the rock; the egrets stretched Their snowy wings; green parrots fetched Fruit to their young with joyous cries; The monkey-peoples' mild brown eyes Glittered from bough and coping-stone; And‚Äîunderneath a root‚Äîalone, Dwelt a great cobra, thick and black, With ash-grey mottlings on his back,‚Äî A most prodigious snake!‚Äîbut he Kept the peace, too, religiously, With folded hood, and fangs of death Sheathed, while he drew his slow, cold breath, Coiled in the sun, or lapped the feast Of warm milk poured him by the Priest. For in that Temple lived a Sage, A Twice-born, reverend by his age And wondrous wisdom; and, it fell For some small service,‚Äîvain to tell,‚Äî This Brahman was my friend; and so, Ofttimes at daybreak I would go To watch the sunlight flood the skies, And ask of strange philosophies. Thus chanced it that one morn we had Talk on this same Upanishad,‚Äî (Beyond my learning, then, as now,) But herein is it written how I slowly spelled the text we read, And, at the hard words, what he said‚Äî (For nowise shall one comprehend Such lore without some sager friend‚Äî) So have you, Dear! the help I had Conning this great Upanishad, While the snake sunned himself at ease, And monkeys chattered in the trees, And on the Moota-Moola lay The first gold of the growing Day. THE RAJPOOT WIFE. Sing something, Jymul Rao! for the goats are gathered now, And no more water is to bring; The village-gates are set, and the night is grey as yet, God hath given wondrous fancies to thee:‚Äîsing! Then Jymul's supple fingers, with a touch that doubts and lingers, Sets a thrill the saddest wire of all the six; And the girls sit in a tangle, and hush the tinkling bangle, While the boys pile the flame with store of sticks. And vain of village praise, but full of ancient days, He begins with a smile and with a sigh‚Äî ‚ÄúWho knows the b√¢bul-tree by the bend of the Ravee?‚Äù Quoth Gunesh, ‚ÄúI!‚Äù and twenty voices, ‚ÄúI!‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äîlisten! there below, in the shade of bloom and bough, Is a musjid of carved and coloured stone; And Abdool Shureef Khan‚ÄîI spit, to name that man!‚Äî Lieth there, underneath, all alone. ‚ÄúHe was Sultan Mahmood's vassal, and wore an Amir's tassel In his green hadj-turban, at Nungul. Yet the head which went so proud, it is not in his shroud; There are bones in that grave,‚Äîbut not a skull! ‚ÄúAnd, deep drove in his breast, there moulders with the rest A dagger, brighter once than Chundra's ray; A Rajpoot lohar whet it, and a Rajpoot woman set it Past the power of any hand to tear away. ‚Äú'Twas the Ranee Neila true, the wife of Soorj Dehu, The Lord of the Rajpoots of Nourpoor; You shall hear the mournful story, with its sorrow and its glory, And curse Shureef Khan,‚Äîthe soor!‚Äù All in the wide Five-Waters was none like Soorj Dehu, To foeman who so dreadful, to friend what heart so true? Like Indus, through the mountains came down the Muslim ranks, And town-walls fell before them as flooded river-banks; But Soorj Dehu the Rajpoot owned neither town nor wall; His house the camp, his roof-tree the sky that covers all; His seat of state the saddle; his robe a shirt of mail; His court a thousand Rajpoots close at his stallion's tail. Not less was Soorj a Rajah because no crown he wore Save the grim helm of iron with sword-marks dinted o'er; Because he grasped no sceptre save the sharp tulwar, made Of steel that fell from heaven,‚Äîfor 'twas Indra forged that blade! And many a starless midnight the shout of ‚ÄúSoorj Dehu!‚Äù Broke up with spear and matchlock the Muslim's ‚ÄúIllahu!‚Äù And many a day of battle upon the Muslim proud Fell Soorj, as Indra's lightning falls from the silent cloud. Nor ever shot nor arrow, nor spear nor slinger's stone, Could pierce the mail that Neila the Ranee buckled on: But traitor's subtle tongue-thrust through fence of steel can break; And Soorj was taken sleeping, whom none had ta'en awake. Then at the noon, in durbar, swore fiercely Shureef Khan That Soorj should die in torment, or live a Mussulman. But Soorj laughed lightly at him, and answered, ‚ÄúWork your will! The last breath of my body shall curse your Prophet still.‚Äù With words of insult shameful, and deeds of cruel kind, They vexed that Rajpoot's body, but never moved his mind. And one is come who sayeth, ‚ÄúHo! Rajpoots! Soorj is bound; Your lord is caged and baited by Shureef Khan, the hound. ‚ÄúThe Khan hath caught and chained him, like a beast, in iron cage, And all the camp of Islam spends on him spite and rage; ‚ÄúAll day the coward Muslims spend on him rage and spite; If ye have thought to help him, 'twere good ye go to-night.‚Äù Up sprang a hundred horsemen, flashed in each hand a sword; In each heart burned the gladness of dying for their lord; Up rose each Rajpoot rider, and buckled on with speed The bridle-chain and breast-cord, and the saddle of his steed. But unto none sad Neila gave word to mount and ride; Only she called the brothers of Soorj unto her side, And said, ‚ÄúTake order straightway to seek this camp with me; If love and craft can conquer, a thousand is as three. ‚ÄúIf love be weak to save him, Soorj dies‚Äîand ye return, For where a Rajpoot dieth, the Rajpoot widows burn.‚Äù Thereat the Ranee Neila unbraided from her hair The pearls as great as Kashmir grapes Soorj gave his wife to wear, And all across her bosoms‚Äîlike lotus-buds to see‚Äî She wrapped the tinselled sari of a dancing Kunchenee; And fastened on her ankles the hundred silver bells, To whose light laugh of music the Nautch-girl darts and dwells. And all in dress a Nautch-girl, but all in heart a queen, She set her foot to stirrup with a sad and settled mien. Only one thing she carried no Kunchenee should bear, The knife between her bosoms;‚Äîho, Shureef! have a care! Thereat, with running ditty of mingled pride and pity, Jymul Rao makes the six wires sigh; And the girls with tearful eyes note the music's fall and rise, And the boys let the fire fade and die. All day lay Soorj the Rajpoot in Shureef's iron cage, All day the coward Muslims spent on him spite and rage. With bitter cruel torments, and deeds of shameful kind, They racked and broke his body, but could not shake his mind. And only at the Azan, when all their worst was vain, They left him, like dogs slinking from a lion in his pain. No meat nor drink they gave him through all that burning day, And done to death, but scornful, at twilight-time he lay. So when the gem of Shiva uprose, the crescent moon, Soorj spake unto his spirit, ‚ÄúThe end is coming soon! ‚ÄúI would the end might hasten, could Neila only know‚Äî What is that Nautch-girl singing with voice so known and low? ‚ÄúSinging beneath the cage-bars the song of love and fear My Neila sang at parting!‚Äîwhat doth that Nautch-girl here? ‚ÄúWhence comes she by the music of Neila's tender strain, She, in that shameless tinsel?‚ÄîO, Nautch-girl, sing again!‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, Soorj!‚Äù‚Äîso followed answer‚Äî‚Äúhere thine own Neila stands, Faithful in life and death alike,‚Äîlook up, and take my hands: ‚ÄúSpeak low, lest the guard hear us;‚Äîto-night, if thou must die, Shureef shall have no triumph, but bear thee company!‚Äù So sang she like the Ko√Øl that dies beside its mate; With eye as black and fearless, and love as hot and great. Then the Chief laid his pallid lips upon the little palm, And sank down with a smile of love, his face all glad and calm; And through the cage-bars Neila felt the brave heart stop fast, ‚ÄúO Soorj!‚Äù‚Äîshe cried‚Äî‚ÄúI follow! have patience to the last.‚Äù She turned and went. ‚ÄúWho passes?‚Äù challenged the Mussulman; ‚ÄúA Nautch-girl, I.‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúWhat seek'st thou?‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúThe presence of the Khan; ‚ÄúAsk if the high chief-captain be pleased to hear me sing?‚Äù And Shureef, full of feasting, the Kunchenee bade bring. Then, all before the Muslims, aflame with lawless wine, Entered the Ranee Neila, in grace and face divine; And all before the Muslims, wagging their goatish chins, The Rajpoot Princess set her to the ‚Äúbee-dance‚Äù that begins, ‚ÄúIf my love loved me, he should be a bee, I the yellow champak, love the honey of me.‚Äù All the wreath√´d movements danced she of that dance; Not a step she slighted, not a wanton glance; In her unveiled bosom chased th' intruding bee, To her waist‚Äîand lower‚Äîshe! a Rajpoot, she! Sang the melting music, swayed the languorous limb: Shureef's drunken heart beat‚ÄîShureef's eyes waxed dim. From his finger Shureef loosed an Ormuz pearl‚Äî ‚ÄúBy the Prophet,‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äú'tis a winsome girl! ‚ÄúTake this ring; and 'prithee, come and have thy pay; I would hear at leisure more of such a lay.‚Äù Glared his eyes on her eyes, passing o'er the plain, Glared at the tent-purdah‚Äînever glared again! Never opened after unto gaze or glance, Eyes that saw a Rajpoot dance a shameful dance; For the kiss she gave him was his first and last‚Äî Kiss of dagger, driven to his heart, and past. At her feet he wallowed, choked with wicked blood; In his breast the katar quivered where it stood. At the hilt his fingers vainly‚Äîwildly‚Äîtry, Then they stiffen feeble;‚Äîdie! thou slayer, die! From his jewelled scabbard drew she Shureef's sword, Cut atwain the neck-bone of the Muslim lord. Underneath the starlight, sooth, a sight of dread! Like the Goddess Kali, comes she with the head, Comes to where her brothers guard their murdered chief; All the camp is silent, but the night is brief. At his feet she flings it, flings her burden vile; ‚ÄúSoorj! I keep my promise! Brothers, build the pile!‚Äù They have built it, set it, all as Rajpoots do, From the cage of iron taken Soorj Dehu; In the lap of Neila, seated on the pile, Laid his head‚Äîshe radiant, like a queen, the while. Then the lamp is lighted, and the ghee is poured‚Äî ‚ÄúSoorj, we burn together: O my love, my lord!‚Äù In the flame and crackle dies her tender tongue, Dies the Ranee, truest, all true wives among. At the morn a clamour runs from tent to tent, Like the wild geese cackling when the night is spent. ‚ÄúShureef Khan lies headless! gone is Soorj Dehu! And the wandering Nautch-girl, who has seen her, who?‚Äù This but know the sentries, at the ‚Äúbreath of dawn‚Äù Forth there fared two horsemen, by the first was borne The urn of clay, the vessel that Rajpoots use to bring The ashes of dead kinsmen to Gunga's holy spring. THE CALIPH'S DRAUGHT. Upon a day in Ramadan‚Äî When sunset brought an end of fast, And in his station every man Prepared to share the glad repast‚Äî Sate Mohtasim in royal state, The pillaw smoked upon the gold; The fairest slave of those that wait Mohtasim's jewelled cup did hold. Of crystal carven was the cup, With turquoise set along the brim, A lid of amber closed it up; 'Twas a great king who gave it him. The slave poured sherbet to the brink, Stirred in wild honey and pomegranate, With snow and rose-leaves cooled the drink, And bore it where the Caliph sate. The Caliph's mouth was dry as bone, He swept his beard aside to quaff:‚Äî The news-reader beneath the throne, Went droning on with ghain and kaf:‚Äî The Caliph drew a mighty breath, Just then the reader read a word‚Äî And Mohtasim, as grim as death, Set down the cup and snatched his sword. ‚ÄúAnn' amratan shureefatee!‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeak clear!‚Äù cries angry Mohtasim; ‚ÄúFe lasr ind' ilj min ulji,‚Äù‚Äî Trembling the newsman read to him How in Ammoria, far from home, An Arab girl of noble race Was captive to a lord of Roum; And how he smote her on the face, And how she cried, for life afraid, ‚ÄúYa, Mohtasim! help, O my king!‚Äù And how the Kafir mocked the maid, And laughed, and spake a bitter thing, ‚ÄúCall louder, fool! Mohtasim's ears Are long as Barak's‚Äîif he heed‚Äî Your prophet's ass; and when he hears, He'll come upon a spotted steed!‚Äù The Caliph's face was stern and red, He snapped the lid upon the cup; ‚ÄúKeep this same sherbet, slave,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúTill such time as I drink it up. Wallah! the stream my drink shall be, My hollowed palm my only bowl, Till I have set that lady free, And seen that Roumi dog's head roll!‚Äù At dawn the drums of war were beat, Proclaiming, ‚ÄúThus saith Mohtasim: ‚ÄòLet all my valiant horsemen meet, And every soldier bring with him A spotted steed.‚Äô‚Äù So rode they forth, A sight of marvel and of fear; Pied horses prancing fiercely north, Three lakhs‚Äîthe cup borne in the rear! When to Ammoria he did win, He smote and drove the dogs of Roum, And rode his spotted stallion in, Crying, ‚ÄúLabbayki! I am come!‚Äù Then downward from her prison-place Joyful the Arab lady crept; She held her hair before her face, She kissed his feet, she laughed and wept. She pointed where that lord was laid: They drew him forth, he whined for grace: Then with fierce eyes Mohtasim said‚Äî ‚ÄúShe whom thou smotest on the face Had scorn, because she called her king: Lo! he is come! and dost thou think To live, who didst this bitter thing While Mohtasim at peace did drink?‚Äù Flashed the fierce sword‚Äîrolled the lord's head; The wicked blood smoked in the sand. ‚ÄúNow bring my cup!‚Äù the Caliph said. Lightly he took it in his hand; As down his throat the sweet drink ran Mohtasim in his saddle laughed, And cried, Taiba asshrab alan! ‚ÄúBy God! delicious is this draught!‚Äù THE STRATFORD PILGRIMS. ‚ÄúAh! the troop at the Tabard Inn, Manciple, Miller, and Frankelyn, Tightening the girths, and draining the ale, And away on their wild ride by river and dale! Gone, Dan Chaucer! gone, but for thee Is the clatter of that gay companie, The rattle and ring of stirrup and spur, Floating of plume, and folding of fur, With the round of tales that held from town To the sweet green slopes of the broad South Down. Certes! with such it were pleasant indeed To patter an Ave, or finger a bead, And forth each dawn by the cock to wend From shrine to shrine unto Albion's end; But their day is done, and their course is run, None goeth forth on a pilgrimage‚Äînone!‚Äù ‚ÄúWell! but the woods are as green as then, And the sunshine as splendid on grey rock and glen; The linnet and missel-thrush sing, I trow, With as rich a trill in their little throats now; Rivers will ripple, and beech-boughs wave, And the meadows be decked in a dress as brave, And the great glad sky build a roof as blue, Tho' it overarch only pilgrims two. Sweetheart, come! let us do as they Did in old time on as fair a day: We lack but a chapel whereunto to wend, A shrine and a saint for our journey's end; And of that gay ride‚Äîthe shrine, God wot, Is the dusty goal that I envy them not.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, pardie!‚Äù quoth she that I love, ‚ÄúFit for thy mood as the hand for the glove, Or the hilt of his sword for the soldier's fist, Or a poet to be praised, or a lip to be kissed, Far on yon path, by the emerald lea, Fair Avon glideth adown to the sea; By the walls of a church, beneath whose stones Sleeps dust sacred as saintly bones,‚Äî His whom thou lovest.‚Äù ‚ÄúRight good!‚Äù I said, And forth a foot to the lea I led, With staff and scrip and a spirit in tune To the merry noise of a midsummer noon:‚Äî Two we were of one heart and age Going a pious pilgrimage. Sooth! I doubt if palmers as gay Ever set forth on so fair a way. Sooth! I doubt if a day so rare Ever made pilgrimage half so fair. But, certes! never did palmers go To holier shrine than where he lies low, Who miracles wrought for heart and eye: The wonder of Imogen's constancy, The airy marvels of Prospero's isle, The magic of Queen Cleopatra's smile; Her barge that burned on the glowing water, The patience and faith of Lear's leal daughter, The Roman Portia's fond, firm heart, And the Veronese lovers death did not part. Something I laughed, Heav'n 'ield it me, At Beckett and Benedict saints,‚Äînot he! So came we on where the wayfarer sees Far Warwick fading behind the trees, And Guy's great castle behind the town, That ‚Äúsetter up,‚Äù and that ‚Äúpuller down.‚Äù For ‚ÄúStratford‚Äîho!‚Äù our green road lay, And I spake with my heart in the ancient day: ‚ÄúSweet! thou art fair for a prioress, And I am an ‚ÄòOxenforde clerke,‚Äô no less; Tell out some fable of ancient day! I rede you to prove that woman may Be as true as man!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúBenedicite!‚Äù ‚ÄúHearken my story and judge,‚Äù quoth she. Vernier. If ever thou shalt follow silver Seine Through his French vineyards and French villages, For love of love and pity turn aside At Vernier, and bear to linger there! The gentle river doth so‚Äîlingering long Round the dark marshland, and the pool Grand'mer, And then with slower ripple steals away Down from his merry Paris. Do thou this; 'Tis kind to keep a memory of the dead,‚Äî The bygone, silent dead; and these lie there, Buried a twenty fathoms in the pool, Whose rough cold wave is closed above their grave, Like the black cover of an ancient book Over a tearful story. Very lovely Was Julie de Montargis: even now‚Äî After six hundred years are dead with her, Her village name‚Äîthe name a stranger hears‚Äî Is, ‚ÄúLa plus belle des belles;‚Äù‚Äîthey tell him yet, The glossy night-black pansies of the land Lost depth in her dark hair; and that she owned The noble Norman eye‚Äîthe violet eye, Almost‚Äîso far and fine its lashes drooped‚Äî Darkened to purple: All the country-folk Went lightly to their work at sight of her; And all their children learned a grace by heart, And said it with small lips when she went by, The Lady of the Castle. Dear past words Was all this beauty and this gentleness Unto her first love and her playfellow, Roland le Vavasour. Too dear to leave, Save that his knightly vow to pluck a palm, And bear the cross broidered above his heart, To where upon the cross Christ died for him, Led him away from loving. But a year, And they shall meet‚Äîalas! to those that joy, It is a pleasant season, all too short, Made of white winter and of scarlet spring, With fireside comfort and sweet summer-nights: But parted lovers count the minutes up, And see no sunshine. Julie heeded none, When she had belted on her Roland's sword, Buckled his breastplate, and upon her lip Taken his last long kisses. Listen now! She was no light-o'-love, to change and change, And, deeply written on her heart, she kept The night and hour the star of Love should see A true love-meeting. Walking by the pool, Many a time she longed to wear a wing, As fleet and white as the swift sea-bird spread, That she might hover over Roland's sails, Follow him to the field, and in the battle Shield the hot Syrian sun from dazing him: High on the turret many an autumn eve, When the light, merry swallow tried his plumes For foreign flight, she gave him messages,‚Äî Fond messages of love, for Palestine, Unto her knight. What wonder, loving so, She greeted well the brother that he sent From Ascalon with spoils‚ÄîClaude Vavasour? Could she do less?‚Äîhe had so deft a hand Upon the mandolin, and sang so well What Roland did so bravely; nay, in sooth, She had not heart to frown upon his songs, When they sang other love and other deeds Than Roland's, being brother to her lord. Yet sometimes was she grave and sad of eye, For knowledge of the spell her glance could work Upon its watcher. Ah! he came to serve, And stayed to love her; and she knew it soon, Past all concealment. Oftentimes his eyes, Fastened upon her face, fell suddenly, For brother-love and shame; but, once and twice, Julie had seen them, through her tender tears, Fixed on some messenger from Holy Land With wild significance, the drawn white lips Working for grief, because she smiled again. He spake no love‚Äîhe breathed no passionate tale, Till there came one who told how Roland's sword, From heel to point, dripped with the Paynim blood; How Ascalon had watched, and Joppa's lists, And Gaza, and Nic√¶a's noble fight, His chivalry; and how, with palm-branch won, Bringing his honours and his wounds a-front, His prow was cleaving Genoa's sapphire sea, Bound homewards. Then, the last day of the year, Claude brought his unused charger to the gate, Sprang to the broad strong back, and reined its rage Into a marble stillness. Yet more still, Young Claude le Vavasour, thy visage was, More marble-white. She stood to see him pass, And their yes met; and, full of tears were hers To mark his suffering; and she called his name, And came below the gate; but he bowed low, And thrust the vizor close over his face, So riding on. Before St. Ouen's shrine That night the lady watched‚Äîa sombre night, With fleeting gleams of fitful moonlight sent 'Twixt driving clouds: the grey stone statues gleamed Through the gloom ghost-like; the still effigies Of knight and abbess had a show of life, Lit by pale crimsons and faint amethysts That fell along them from the oriels; And if she broke the silence with a step, It seemed the echo lent them speech again To speak in ghostly whispers; while, o'er all, With a weird paleness midnight might not hide, Straight from the wall St. Ouen looked upon her, Knitting his granite brows, bidding her hope No lover's kiss that night‚Äîno loving kiss‚Äî None‚Äîthough there came the whisper of her name, And a chill sleety blast of wintry wind Moaning about the tombs, and striking her, For fear, down to her knees. That opened porch Brought more than wind and whisper; there were steps, And the dim wave of a white gaberdine‚Äî Horribly dim; and then the voice again, As though the dead called Julie. Was it dead, The form which, at the holy altar foot, Stood spectral in the flickering window-lights? It does not turn, nor speak, nor seek for her, But passes thro' the chancel, grim and still! Ah, Holy Mother! dead‚Äîand in its hand The pennon of Sir Roland, and the palm, Both laid so stilly on the altar front; A presence like a knight, clad in close mail From spur to crest, yet from his armed heel No footfall; a white face, white as the stones, Lit by the moonlight long enough to know How the dead kept his tryst; and It was gone, Leaving the lady on the flags, ice-cold. Oh, gentle River! thou that knowest all, Tell them how for a while she mourned her Knight; How her grief withered all the rose-bloom off, And wrote its record on her fading cheek; And say, bright River! lest they do her wrong, All the sad story of those twenty moons, The true-love dead‚Äîthe true-love that lived on‚Äî Her clinging memories, and Claude's generous praise, Claude's silent service, and her tearful thanks; And ask them, River, for Saint Charity, To think not too much wrong, that so she gave, Her heart being given and gone, her hand to him, The Brother of her Lord.‚Äî Now banish care! Soothe it with flutings, startle it with drums! Trick it with gold and velvets, till it glow Into a seeming pleasure. Ah, vain! vain! When the bride weeps, what wedding-gear is gay? And since the dawn she weeps‚Äîat orisons She wept‚Äîand while her women clasped the zone, Among its jewels fell her mocking tears. Now at the altar all her answers sigh; Wilt thou?‚ÄîAh! fearful altar-memories‚Äî Ah! spirit-lover‚Äîif he saw me now! Wilt thou?‚Äî‚ÄúOh me! if that he saw me now!‚Äù He doth, he doth! beneath St. Ouen there, As white and still‚Äîyon monk whose cowl is back! Wilt thou?‚Äî‚ÄúAh, dear love, listen and look up.‚Äù He doth‚Äîah God! with hollow eyes a-fire. Wilt thou?‚Äîpale quivering lips, pale bloodless lips‚Äî ‚ÄúI will not‚Äînever‚Äînever‚ÄîRoland‚Äînever!‚Äù So went the bride a-swoon to Vernier; So doffed each guest his silken braveries; So followed Claude, heart-stricken and amazed, And left the Chapel. But the monk left last, And down the hill-side, swift and straight and lone, Sandals and brown serge brushed the yellow broom, Till to the lake he came and loosed his skiff, And paddled to the lonely island-cell Midway over the wavelets. Long ago The people of the lonely water knew He came alone to dwell there‚Äî'twas the night Of Lady Julie's vigil; ever since The simple fishers left their silver tithe Of lake-fish for him on the wave-worn flags, Wherefrom he wandered not, save when that day He went unasked, and marred the bridal show,‚Äî Wherefore none knew, nor how,‚Äîsave two alone, A lady swooning‚Äîand a monk at prayers. And now not Castle-gates, nor cell, nor swoon, Nor splashing waters, nor the flooded marsh, Can keep these two apart. The Chapel-bells Ring Angelus and Even-song, and then Sleep, like her waiting maidens‚Äîonly Blanche, Her foster-sister, lying at the gate, Dreaming of roving spirits‚Äîstarts at one, And marvels at the night-gear, poorly hid, And overdone with pity at her plaint, Lets her dear Lady forth, and watches her Gleaming from crag to crag‚Äîbut lost at last, A white speck on the night. More watchful eyes Follow her flying;‚Äîdown the water-path, Mad at his broken bridals, sore amazed With fear and pain, Claude tracks the wanderer‚Äî Waits, while the wild white fingers loose the cord‚Äî But when she drove the shallop through the lake Straight for the island-cell, he brooked no stay, But doffed his steel-coat on the reedy rim, And gave himself to the quick-plashing pool, And swimming in the foam her fleetness made, Strove after‚Äîsometimes losing his white guide, Down-sinking in the dark wash of the waves. Together to the island-cell they come, The shallop and the swimmer‚Äîshe alone Thrusts at the wicket,‚Äîenters wet and wild. What sees he there under the crucifix? What holds his eyesight to the ivied loop? Oh, Claude!‚Äîoh furious heart! be still, or break! The Monk and Julie kneeling, not at prayer! She kisses him with warm, wild, eager lips‚Äî Weeps on his heart‚Äîthat woman, nearly wived, And ‚ÄúSweetest love,‚Äù she saith, ‚ÄúI thought thee dead.‚Äù And he‚Äîwho is he that he fondles so In his her shaking hands, and bends adown, Crying, ‚ÄúAh, my lost love! it was no ghost That left the palm-branch; but I saw thee not In the dim moonlight of the midnight aisle; And heard their talk of Claude, and held thee false, These many erring days.‚Äù Now, gaze no more, Claude, Claude, for thy soul's peace! She binds the brand About his gaberdine, with close caress; She fondles the thin neck, and clasps thereon The gorget! then the breast-piece and the helm Her quick hands fasten. ‚ÄúCome away,‚Äù she cries, ‚ÄúThou Knight, and take me from them all for thine. Come, true-love! come.‚Äù The pebbles, water-washed, Grate with the gliding of the shallop's keel, Scarce bearing up those twain. Frail boat, be strong! Three lives are thine to keep‚Äîah, Lady pale, Choose of two lovers‚Äîfor the other comes With a wild bound that shakes the rotten plank. Moon! shine out clear for Claude's avenging blow! She glitters on a quiet face and form That shuns it not,‚Äîyet stays the lifted death. ‚ÄúMy brother Roland!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúClaude, ah, brother mine!‚Äù‚Äî ‚ÄúI thought thee dead!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúI would that I had died Ere this had come!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúJust God! but she is thine!‚Äù‚Äî ‚ÄúHe wills her not for either! look, we fill, The current drifts us, and the oars are gone, I will leap forth!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúNow by the breast we sucked, So shalt thou not: let the black waters break Over a broken heart!‚Äù‚Äî‚ÄúNay, tell him no; Bid him to save thee, Julie‚ÄîI will leap!‚Äù So strove they sinking, sinking‚ÄîJulie bending Between them; and those brothers over her With knees and arms close locked for leave to die Each for the other;‚Äîwhile the Moon shone down, Silvering their far-off home, and the black wave That struck, and rose, and floated over them, Hushing their death-cries, hiding their kind strife, Ending the love of those great troubled hearts With silence, save for lapping of the lake. ‚ÄúVerily!‚Äù spake I, ‚Äúa troubled dame! Sweet! grand' merci for this same! Tender and fair is the chronicle That Vernier taught thee featly to tell! Tenderer, fairer its lessons seem From lips which speak and eyes which beam So true a truth, and so fast a faith, Oh Love, whom I love for life and for death!‚Äî But thou in thy turn have heed to me; I know a story of constancy Where woman was changeful, and man was true: Peradventure, Kate! I shall tell it through Before we come where Shakespeare's bones Make holy walking of Stratford stones! ‚ÄúNay, but recount!‚Äù she softly said, Doubtfully tossing a wilful head: And hand in hand, in the shade of the limes, I told this tale of the Saracen times. KING SALADIN. Long years ago‚Äîso writes Boccaccio In such Italian gentleness of speech As finds no echo in this northern air To counterpart its music‚Äîlong ago, When Saladin was Soldan of the East, The kings let cry a general crusade; And to the trysting-plains of Lombardy The idle lances of the North and West Rode all that spring, as all the spring runs down Into a lake, from all its hanging hills, The clash and glitter of a hundred streams. Whereof the rumour reached to Saladin; And that swart king‚Äîas royal in his heart As any crown√®d champion of the Cross‚Äî That he might fully, of his knowledge, learn The purpose of the lords of Christendom, And when their war and what their armament, Took thought to cross the seas to Lombardy. Wherefore, with wise and trustful Amirs twain, All habited in garbs that merchants use, With trader's band and gipsire on the breasts Which best loved mail and dagger, Saladin Set forth upon his journey perilous. In that day, lordly land was Lombardy! A sea of country-plenty, islanded With cities rich; nor richer one than thou, Marble Milano! from whose gate at dawn‚Äî With ear that little recked the matin-bell, But a keen eye to measure wall and fosse‚Äî The Soldan rode; and all day long he rode For Pavia; passing basilic, and shrine, And gaze of vineyard-workers, wotting not Yon trader was the Lord of Heathenesse. All day he rode; yet at the wane of day No gleam of gate, or ramp, or rising spire, Nor Tessin's sparkle underneath the stars Promised him Pavia; but he was 'ware Of a gay company upon the way, Ladies and lords, with horses, hawks, and hounds; Cap-plumes and tresses fluttered by the wind Of merry race for home. ‚ÄúGo!‚Äù said the king To one that rode upon his better hand, ‚ÄúAnd pray these gentles of their courtesy How many leagues to Pavia, and the gates What hour they close them?‚Äù Then the Saracen Set spur, and being joined to him that seemed First of the hunt, he told the message‚Äîthey Checking their jangling bits, and chiding down The unfinished laugh, to listen‚Äîbut by this Came up the king, his bonnet in his hand, Theirs doffed to him: ‚ÄúSir Trader,‚Äù Torel said (Messer Torello 'twas, of Istria), ‚ÄúThey shut the Pavian gate at even-song, And even-song is sung.‚Äù Then, turning half, Muttered, ‚ÄúPardie, the man is worshipful, A stranger too!‚Äù ‚ÄúFair lord!‚Äù quoth Saladin, ‚ÄúPlease you to stead some weary travellers, Saying where we may lodge, the town so far And night so near.‚Äù ‚ÄúOf my heart, willingly,‚Äù Made answer Torel, ‚ÄúI did think but now To send my knave an errand‚Äîhe shall ride And bring you into lodgment‚Äîoh! no thanks, Our Lady keep you!‚Äù then with whispered hest He called their guide and sped them. Being gone, Torello told his purpose, and the band, With ready zeal and loosened bridle-chains, Rode for his hunting-palace, where they set A goodly banquet underneath the planes, And hung the house with guest-lights, and anon Welcomed those wondering strangers, thereto led Unwitting, by a world of winding paths; Messer Torello, at the inner gate, Waiting to take them in‚Äîa winsome host, Stamped current with God's image for a man Chief among men, truthful, and just, and free There he, ‚ÄúWell met again, fair sirs! Our knave Hath found you shelter better than the worst: Please you to leave your selles, and being bathed, Grace our poor supper here.‚Äù Then Saladin, Whose sword had yielded ere his courtesy, Answered, ‚ÄúGreat thanks, Sir Knight, and this much blame, You spoil us for our trade! two bonnets doffed, And travellers' questions holding you afield, For such you give us this.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir! not your meed, Nor worthy of your breeding; but in sooth That is not out of Pavia.‚Äù Thereupon He led them to fair chambers decked with all Makes tired men glad; lights, and the marble bath, And flasks that sparkled, liquid amethyst, And grapes, not dry as yet from evening dew. Thereafter at the supper-board they sat; Nor lacked it, though its guest was reared a king, Worth provend in crafts of cookery, Pastel, pasticcio‚Äîall set forth on gold; And gracious talk and pleasant courtesies, Spoken in stately Latin, cheated time Till there was none but held that stranger-sir, For all his chapman's dress of cramasie, Goodlier than silks could make him. Presently Talk rose upon the Holy Sepulchre: ‚ÄúI go myself,‚Äù said Torel, ‚Äúwith a score Of better knights‚Äîthe flower of Pavia‚Äî To try our steel against King Saladin's. Sirs! ye have seen the countries of the Sun, Know you the Soldan?‚Äù Answer gave the king, ‚ÄúThe Soldan we have seen‚Äî'twill push him hard If, which I nothing doubt, you Pavian lords Are valorous as gentle;‚Äîwe, alas! Be Cyprus merchants making trade to France‚Äî Dull sons of Peace.‚Äù ‚ÄúBy Mary!‚Äù Torel cried, ‚ÄúBut for thy word, I ne'er heard speech so fit To lead the war, nor saw a hand that sat Liker a soldier's where thy sword should be; But sure I hold you sleepless!‚Äù Then himself Playing the chamberlain, with torches borne, Led them to restful beds, commending them To sleep and God, Who hears‚ÄîAllah or God‚Äî When good men do his creatures charities. At dawn the cock, and neigh of saddled steeds, Broke the king's dreams of battle‚Äînot their own, But goodly jennets from Torello's stalls, Caparisoned to bear them; he their host Up, with a gracious radiance like the sun, To bid them speed. Beside him in the court Stood Dame Adalieta; comely she, And of her port as queenly, and serene As if the braided gold about her brows Had been a crown. Mutual good-morrow given, Thanks said and stayed, the lady prayed her guest To take a token of his sojourn there, Marking her good-will, not his worthiness; ‚ÄúA gown of miniver‚Äîthese furbelows Are silk I spun‚Äîmy lord wears ever such‚Äî A housewife's thought! but those ye love are far; Wear it as given for them.‚Äù Then Saladin‚Äî ‚ÄúA precious gift, Madonna, past my thanks; And‚Äîbut thou shalt not hear a ‚Äòno‚Äô from me‚Äî Past my receiving; yet I take it; we Were debtors to your noble courtesy Out of redemption‚Äîthis but bankrupts us.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, sir,‚ÄîGod shield you!‚Äù said the knight and dame: And Saladin, with phrase of gentilesse Returned, or ever that he rode alone, Swore a great oath in guttural Arabic, An oath by Allah‚Äîstartling up the ears Of those three Christian cattle they bestrode‚Äî That never yet was princelier-natured man, Nor gentler lady;‚Äîand that time should see For a king's lodging quittance royal repaid. It was the day of the Passaggio: Ashore the war-steeds champed the burnished bits; Afloat the galleys tugged the mooring chains: The town was out; the Lombard armourers‚Äî Red-hot with riveting the helmets up, And whetting axes for the heathen heads‚Äî Cooled in the crowd which filled the squares and streets To speed God's soldiers. At the nones that day Messer Torello to the gate came down, Leading his lady;‚Äîsorrow's hueless rose Grew on her cheek, and thrice the destrier Struck fire, impatient, from the pavement-squares, Or ere she spoke, tears in her lifted eyes, ‚ÄúGoest thou, lord of mine?‚Äù ‚ÄúMadonna, yes!‚Äù Said Torel, ‚Äúfor my soul's weal and the Lord Ride I to-day: my good name and my house Reliant I intrust thee, and‚Äîbecause It may be they shall slay me, and because, Being so young, so fair, and so reputed, The noblest will entreat thee‚Äîwait for me, Widow or wife, a year, and month, and day; Then, if thy kinsmen press thee to a choice, And if I be not come, hold me for dead; Nor link thy blooming beauty with the grave Against thy heart.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood my lord!‚Äù answered she, ‚ÄúHardly my heart sustains to let thee go; Thy memory it can keep, and keep it will, Though my one love, Torel of Istria, Live, or ?‚Äù ‚ÄúSweet, comfort thee! San Pietro speed! I shall come home: if not, and worthy knees Bend for this hand, whereof none worthy lives, Least he who lays his last kiss thus upon it, Look thee, I free it ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúNay!‚Äù she said, ‚Äúbut I, A petulant slave that hugs her golden chain, Give that gift back, and with it this poor ring: Set it upon thy sword-hand, and in fight Be merciful and win, thinking of me.‚Äù Then she, with pretty action, drawing on Her ruby, buckled over it his glove‚Äî The great steel glove‚Äîand through the helmet bars Took her last kiss;‚Äîthen let the chafing steed Have its hot will and go. But Saladin, Safe back among his lords at Lebanon, Well wotting of their quest, awaited it, And held the Crescent up against the Cross. In many a doughty fight Ferrara blades Clashed with keen Damasc, many a weary month Wasted afield; but yet the Christians Won nothing nearer to Christ's sepulchre; Nay, but gave ground. At last, in Acre pent, On their loose files, enfeebled by the war, Came stronger smiter than the Saracen‚Äî The deadly Pest: day after day they died, Pikeman and knight-at-arms; day after day A thinner line upon the leaguered wall Held off the heathen:‚Äîheld them off a space; Then, over-weakened, yielded, and gave up The city and the stricken garrison. So to sad chains and hateful servitude Fell all those purple lords‚ÄîChristendom's stars, Once high in hope as soaring Lucifer, Now low as sinking Hesper: with them fell Messer Torello‚Äînever one so poor Of all the hundreds that his bounty fed As he in prison‚Äîill-entreated, bound, Starved of sweet light, and set to shameful tasks; And that great load at heart to know the days Fast flying, and to live accounted dead. One joy his gaolers left him,‚Äîhis good hawk; The brave, gay bird that crossed the seas with him: And often, in the mindful hour of eve, With tameless eye and spirit masterful, In a feigned anger checking at his hand, The good grey falcon made his master cheer. One day it chanced Saladin rode afield With shawled and turbaned Amirs, and his hawks‚Äî Lebanon-bred, and mewed as princes lodge‚Äî Flew foul, forgot their feather, hung at wrist, And slighted call. The Soldan, quick in wrath, Bade slay the cravens, scourge the falconer, And seek some wight who knew the heart of hawks, To keep it hot and true. Then spake a Sheikh‚Äî ‚ÄúThere is a Frank in prison by the sea, Far-seen herein.‚Äù ‚ÄúGive word that he be brought,‚Äù Quoth Saladin, ‚Äúand bid him set a cast: If he hath skill, it shall go well for him.‚Äù Thus, by the winding path of circumstance, One palace held, as prisoner and prince, Torello and his guest: unwitting each, Nay and unwitting, though they met and spake Of that goshawk and this‚Äîsignors in serge, And chapmen crowned, who knows?‚Äîtill on a time Some trick of face, the manner of some smile, Some gleam of sunset from the glad days gone, Caught the king's eye, and held it. ‚ÄúNazarene! What native art thou?‚Äù asked he. ‚ÄúLombard I, A man of Pavia.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd thy name?‚Äù ‚ÄúTorel, Messer Torello called in happier times, Now best uncalled.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome hither, Christian!‚Äù The Soldan said, and led the way, by court And hall and fountain, to an inner room Rich with king's robes: therefrom he reached a gown, And ‚ÄúKnow'st thou this?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHigh lord! I might Elsewhere,‚Äù quoth Torel, ‚Äúhere 'twere mad to say Yon gown my wife unto a trader gave Who shared our board.‚Äù ‚ÄúNay, but that gown is this, And she the giver, and the trader I,‚Äù Quoth Saladin; ‚ÄúI! twice a king to-day, Owing a royal debt and paying it.‚Äù Then Torel, sore amazed, ‚ÄúGreat lord, I blush, Remembering how the Master of the East Lodged sorrily.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's Master's Master thou!‚Äù Gave answer Saladin, ‚Äúcome in and see What wares the Cyprus traders keep at home; Come forth and take thy place, Saladin's friend!‚Äù Therewith into the circle of his lords, With gracious mien the Soldan led his slave; And while the dark eyes glittered, seated him First of the full divan. ‚ÄúOrient lords,‚Äù So spake he,‚Äî‚Äúlet the one who loves his king Honour this Frank, whose house sheltered your king; He is my brother:‚Äù then the night-black beards Swept the stone floor in ready reverence, Agas and Amirs welcoming Torel: And a great feast was set, the Soldan's friend Royally garbed, upon the Soldan's hand, Shining, the bright star of the banqueters. All which, and the abounding grace and love Shown him by Saladin, a little held The heart of Torel from its Lombard home With Dame Adalieta: but it chanced He sat beside the king in audience, And there came one who said, ‚ÄúOh, Lord of lords, That galley of the Genovese which sailed With Frankish prisoners is gone down at sea.‚Äù ‚ÄúGone down!‚Äù cried Torel. ‚ÄúAy! what recks it, friend, To fall thy visage for?‚Äù quoth Saladin; ‚ÄúOne galley less to ship-stuffed Genoa!‚Äù ‚ÄúGood my liege!‚Äù Torel said, ‚Äúit bore a scroll Inscribed to Pavia, saying that I lived; For in a year, a month, and day, not come, I bade them hold me dead; and dead I am, Albeit living, if my lady wed, Perchance constrained.‚Äù ‚ÄúCertes,‚Äù spake Saladin, ‚ÄúA noble dame‚Äîthe like not won, once lost‚Äî How many days remain?‚Äù ‚ÄúTen days, my prince, And twelvescore leagues between my heart and me: Alas! how to be passed?‚Äù Then Saladin‚Äî ‚ÄúLo! I am loath to lose thee‚Äîwilt thou swear To come again if all go well with thee, Or come ill speeding?‚Äù ‚ÄúYea, I swear, my king, Out of true love,‚Äù quoth Torel, ‚Äúheartfully.‚Äù Then Saladin, ‚ÄúTake here my signet-seal; My admiral will loose his swiftest sail Upon its sight; and cleave the seas, and go And clip thy dame, and say the Trader sends A gift, remindful of her courtesies.‚Äù Passed were the year, and month, and day; and passed Out of all hearts but one Sir Torel's name, Long given for dead by ransomed Pavians: For Pavia, thoughtless of her Eastern graves, A lovely widow, much too gay for grief, Made peals from half a hundred campaniles To ring a wedding in. The seven bells Of Santo Pietro, from the nones to noon, Boomed with bronze throats the happy tidings out; Till the great tenor, overswelled with sound, Cracked itself dumb. Thereat the sacristan, Leading his swinked ringers down the stairs, Came blinking into sunlight‚Äîall his keys Jingling their little peal about his belt‚Äî Whom, as he tarried, locking up the porch, A foreign signor, browned with southern suns, Turbaned and slippered, as the Muslims use, Plucked by the cope. ‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù quoth he‚Äî'twas a tongue Italian true, but in a Muslim mouth‚Äî ‚ÄúWhy are your belfries busy‚Äîis it peace Or victory, that so ye din the ears Of Pavian lieges?‚Äù ‚ÄúTruly, no liege thou!‚Äù Grunted the sacristan, ‚Äúwho knowest not That Dame Adalieta weds to-night Her fore-betrothed,‚ÄîSir Torel's widow she, That died i' the chain?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo-night!‚Äù the stranger said. ‚ÄúAy, sir, to-night!‚Äîwhy not to-night?‚Äîto-night! And you shall see a goodly Christian feast If so you pass their gates at even-song, For all are asked.‚Äù No more the questioner, But folded o'er his face the Eastern hood, Lest idle eyes should mark how idle words Had struck him home. ‚ÄúSo quite forgot!‚Äîso soon!‚Äî And this the square wherein I gave the joust, And that the loggia, where I fed the poor; And yon my palace, where‚Äîoh, fair! oh, false!‚Äî They robe her for a bridal. Can it be? Clean out of heart, with twice six flying moons, The heart that beat on mine as it would break, That faltered forty oaths. Forced! forced!‚Äînot false‚Äî Well! I will sit, wife, at thy wedding-feast, And let mine eyes give my fond faith the lie.‚Äù So in the stream of gallant guests that flowed Feastward at eve, went Torel; passed with them The outer gates, crossed the great courts with them, A stranger in the walls that called him lord. Cressets and coloured lamps made the way bright, And rose-leaves strewed to where within the doors The master of the feast, the bridegroom, stood, A-glitter from his forehead to his foot, Speaking fair welcomes. He, a courtly sir, Marking the Eastern guest, bespoke him sweet, Prayed place for him, and bade them set his seat Upon the dais. Then the feast began, And wine went free as wit, and music died‚Äî Outdone by merrier laughter:‚Äîonly one Nor ate nor drank, nor spoke nor smiled; but gazed On the pale bride, pale as her crown of pearls, Who sate so cold and still, and sad of cheer, At the bride-feast. But of a truth, Torel Read the thoughts right that held her eyelids down, And knew her loyal to her memories. Then to a little page who bore the wine, He spake, ‚ÄúGo tell thy lady thus from me: In mine own land, if any stranger sit A wedding-guest, the bride, out of her grace, In token that she knows her guest's good-will, In token she repays it, brims a cup, Wherefrom he drinking she in turn doth drink; So is our use.‚Äù The little page made speed And told the message. Then that lady pale‚Äî Ever a gentle and a courteous heart‚Äî Lifted her troubled eyes and smiled consent On the swart stranger. By her side, untouched, Stood the brimmed gold; ‚ÄúBear this,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand pray He hold a Christian lady apt to learn A kindly lesson.‚Äù But Sir Torel loosed From off his finger‚Äînever loosed before‚Äî The ring she gave him on the parting day; And ere he drank, behind his veil of beard Dropped in the cup the ruby, quaffed, and sent.‚Äî So she, with sad smile, set her lips to drink; And‚Äîsomething in the Cyprus touching them‚Äî Glanced‚Äîgazed‚Äîthe ring!‚Äîher ring!‚ÄîJove! how she eyes The wistful eyes of Torel!‚Äîhow, heartsure, Under all guise knowing her lord returned, She springs to meet him coming!‚Äîtelling all In one great cry of joy. Good Lord! the rout, The storm of questions! stilled, when Torel spake His name, and, known of all, claimed the Bride Wife Maugre the wasted feast, and woful groom. All hearts save his were light to see Torel; But Adalieta's lightest, as she plucked The bridal-veil away. Something therein‚Äî A lady's dagger‚Äîsmall, and bright, and fine‚Äî Clashed out upon the marble. ‚ÄúWherefore that?‚Äù Asked Torel; answered she, ‚ÄúI knew you true; And I could live, so long as I might wait; But they‚Äîthey pressed me hard! my days of grace Ended to-night‚Äîand I had ended too, Faithful to death, if so thou hadst not come.‚Äù ‚ÄúGod quit all gentle lovers,‚Äù quoth she, ‚ÄúAnd give them grace for their constancy, For this, from Boccace, sheweth, of both, That true-love ever begetteth troth! Peace have they now in the changeless rest Where he is gone, whom thou lovest best, The Master of poets, whose own words prove It ‚Äònever ran smooth,‚Äô the ‚Äòcourse of love!‚Äô Since here is Stratford, and yonder wave Is lilied Avon's, which girdles his grave!‚Äù So came we, two of one heart and age Making our pious pilgrimage! THE RAJAH'S RIDE. A PUNJAB SONG. Now is the Devil-horse come to Sindh! Wah! wah! Gooroo!‚Äîthat is true! His belly is stuffed with the fire and the wind, But a fleeter steed had Runjeet Dehu! It's forty koss from Lahore to the ford, Forty and more to far Jummoo; Fast may go the Feringhee lord, But never so fast as Runjeet Dehu! Runjeet Dehu was King of the Hill, Lord and eagle of every crest; Now the swords and the spears are still, God will have it‚Äîand God knows best! Rajah Runjeet sate in the sky, Watching the loaded Kafilas in; Affghan, Kashmeree, passing by, Paid him pushm to save their skin. Once he caracoled into the plain, Wah! the sparkle of steel on steel! And up the pass came singing again With a lakh of silver borne at his heel. Once he trusted the Mussulman's word, Wah! wah! trust a liar to lie! Down from his eyrie they tempted my Bird, And clipped his wings that he could not fly. Fettered him fast in far Lahore, Fast by the gate at the Runchenee P√ªl; Sad was the soul of Chunda Kour, Glad the merchants of rich Kurnool. Ten months Runjeet lay in Lahore‚Äî Wah! a hero's heart is brass! Ten months never did Chunda Kour Braid her hair at the tiring-glass. There came a steed from Toorkistan, Wah! God made him to match the hawk! Fast beside him the four grooms ran, To keep abreast of the Toorkman's walk. Black as the bear on Iskardoo; Savage at heart as a tiger chained; Fleeter than hawk that ever flew, Never a Muslim could ride him reined. ‚ÄúRunjeet Dehu! come forth from thy hold‚Äù‚Äî Wah! ten months had rusted his chain! ‚ÄúRide this Sheitan's liver cold‚Äù‚Äî Runjeet twisted his hand in the mane; Runjeet sprang to the Toorkman's back, Wah! a king on a kingly throne! Snort, black Sheitan! till nostrils crack, Rajah Runjeet sits, a stone. Three times round the Maidan he rode, Touched its neck at the Kashmeree wall, Struck the spurs till they spirted blood, Leapt the rampart before them all! Breasted the waves of the blue Ravee, Forty horsemen mounting behind, Forty bridle-chains flung free,‚Äî Wah! wah! better chase the wind! Chunda Kour sate sad in Jummoo:‚Äî Hark! what horse-hoof echoes without? ‚ÄúRise! and welcome Runjeet Dehu‚Äî Wash the Toorkman's nostrils out! ‚ÄúForty koss he has come, my life! Forty koss back he must carry me; Rajah Runjeet visits his wife, He steals no steed like an Afreedee. ‚ÄúThey bade me teach them how to ride‚Äî Wah! wah! now I have taught them well!‚Äù Chunda Kour sank low at his side; Rajah Runjeet rode the hill. When he came back to far Lahore‚Äî Long or ever the night began‚Äî Spake he, ‚ÄúTake your horse once more, He carries well‚Äîwhen he bears a man!‚Äù Then they gave him a khillut and gold, All for his honour and grace and truth; Sent him back to his mountain-hold‚Äî Muslim manners have touch of ruth; Sent him back, with dances and drum‚Äî Wah! my Rajah Runjeet Dehu! To Chunda Kour and his Jummoo home‚Äî Wah! wah! Futtee!‚Äîwah, Gooroo! A BIHARI MILL-SONG. Of eight great beams the boat was wrought, With four red row-pins;‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! When Mirza Saheb spied at the Ghaut Bhagbati bathing:‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúOh, girls! that hither your chatties bring, Who is this bathing?‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúThe Head of our village is Horil Singh; 'Tis the Raja's sister!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúRun thou, Barber!‚Äîand, Peon! run thou; Bring hither that Rajp√ªt!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúOh, girls! who carry the chatties, now, Which is his dwelling?‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúThe dwelling of Horil Singh looks north, And north of the door is a sandal-tree:‚Äù‚Äî With arms fast-bound they brought him forth; ‚ÄúSalaam to the Mirza!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúTake, Horil Singh, this basket of gold, And give me thy sister, sweet Bhagbati.‚Äù ‚ÄúFire burn thy basket!‚Äù he answered, bold,‚Äî ‚ÄúMy sister's a Rajp√ªt!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Horil's wife came down from her house; She weeps in the courtyard: ‚ÄúCurs√´d be, Oh, sister-in-law, thy beautiful brows! My husband is chained for them!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúNow, sister-in-law! of thy house keep charge, And the duties therein:‚Äù quoth Bhagbati ‚ÄúFor Horil Singh shall be set at large, I go to release him!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! When Bhagbati came to the Mirza's hall Low she salaamed to him:‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúThe fetters of Horil Singh let fall, If, Mirza,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthou desirest me.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf, Mirza,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúthou wouldst have my love, Dye me a bride-cloth;‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúSaffron beneath and vermilion above, Fit for a Rajp√ªt!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúIf, Mirza,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI am fair in thine eyes, And mine is thy heart, now,‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúCommand me jewels of rich device, Fit for a Rajp√ªt!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúIf, Mirza,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI must do this thing, Quitting my people,‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúThe palanquin and the bearers bring, That I go not afoot from them!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Smiling, he bade the dyers haste To dye her a bride-cloth:‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Weeping‚Äîweeping, around her waist Bhagbati bound it.‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Smiling, he bought, from the goldsmith's best, Jewels unparalleled:‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Weeping, weeping‚Äîon neck and breast Bhagbati clasped them.‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Joyously smiling, ‚ÄúBring forth,‚Äù he cried, ‚ÄúMy gilded palanquin!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Bitterly sorrowing, entered the bride, Beautiful Bhagbati.‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! A koss and a half of a koss went they, And another koss after;‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Then Bhagbati thirsted: ‚ÄúBearers, stay! I would drink at the tank here!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! ‚ÄúTake from my cup,‚Äù the Mirza said: ‚ÄúOh, not to-day will I take!‚Äù quoth she: ‚ÄúFor this was my father's tank, who is dead, And it soon will be distant!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! She quaffed one draught from her hollowed palm, And again she dipped it;‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Then leaped in the water, dark and calm, And sank from the sight of them.‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Sorely the Mirza bewailed, and hid His face in his cloth, for rage to be So mocked: ‚ÄúSee, now, in all she did Bhagbati fooled me!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Grieving, the Mirza cast a net Dragging the water;‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Only shells and weeds did he get, Shells and bladder-weeds.‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Laughing, a net cast Horil Singh, Dragging the water;‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! Lo! at the first sweep, up they bring Dead, cold Bhagbati‚Äîfair to see! Laughing, homeward the Rajp√ªt wends, Chewing his betel; ‚Äúfor now,‚Äù quoth he, ‚ÄúIn honour this leap of Bhagbati ends Ten generations!‚Äù‚ÄîHu-ri-jee! HINDOO FUNERAL SONG. Call on Rama! call to Rama! Oh, my brothers, call on Rama! For this Dead Whom we bring, Call aloud to mighty Rama! As we bear him, oh, my brothers, Call together, very loudly, That the Bh√ªts May be scared; That his spirit pass in comfort. Turn his feet now, calling ‚ÄúRama,‚Äù Calling ‚ÄúRama,‚Äù who shall take him When the flames Make an end: Ram! Ram!‚Äîoh, call to Rama! SONG OF THE SERPENT CHARMERS. Come forth, oh, Snake! come forth, oh, glittering Snake! Oh shining, silent, deadly N√¢g! appear, Dance to the music that we make, This serpent-song, so sweet and clear, Blown on the beaded gourd, so clear, So soft and clear. Oh, dread Lord Snake! come forth and spread thy hood, And drink the milk and suck the eggs; and show Thy tongue; and own the tune is good: Hear, Maharaj! how hard we blow! Ah, Maharaj! for thee we blow; See how we blow! Great Uncle Snake! creep forth and dance to-day! This music is the music snakes love best; Taste the warm white new milk, and play Standing erect, with fangs at rest, Dancing on end, sharp fangs at rest, Fierce fangs at rest. Ah, wise Lord N√¢g! thou comest!‚ÄîFear thou not! We make salaam to thee, the Serpent-King, Draw forth thy folds, knot after knot; Dance, Master! while we softly sing; Dance, Serpent! while we play and sing, We play and sing. Dance, dreadful King! whose kisses strike men dead; Dance this side, mighty Snake! the milk is here! [They seize the Cobra by the neck.] Ah, shabash! pin his angry head! Thou fool! this nautch shall cost thee dear; Wrench forth his fangs! this piping clear It costs thee dear! SONG OF THE FLOUR-MILL. Turn the merry mill-stone, Gunga! Pour the golden grain in; Those that twist the Churrak fastest The cakes soonest win: Good stones, turn! The fire begins to burn; Gunga, stay not! The heart is nearly hot. Grind the hard gold to silver, Sing quick to the stone; Feed its mouth with dal and bajri, It will feed us anon. Sing, Gunga! to the mill-stone, It helps the wheel hum; Blithesome hearts and willing elbows Make the fine meal come: Handsful three For Gopal, you, and me; Now it falls white, Good stones, bite! Drive it round and round, my Gunga! Sing soft to the stone; Better corn and churrak-working Than idleness and none. [Note.‚ÄîThe above three songs were written to native Hindoo melodies.] THE KNIGHT'S TOMB AT SWANSCOMBE CHURCH. Where, through western windows, dieth‚Äî Gold and rose‚Äîthe sunset's light, With his dame, in marble, lieth Andrew Weldon, arm√´d Knight: Side by side, the legend sayeth, These two lived and died: Seemeth it most fair and fit To rest so, side by side. Nothing here, above or under, Of fanatic gloom; No fool's fear of death's deep wonder Spoils their simple tomb: Seems it that the sculptor carved it Only for to show What the Lady and the Knight were Now they are not so. Silvery twitters of swift swallows Reach them, flashing by; Shadows of the spear-leaved sallows On their foreheads lie, Shadows of the flickering sallows, Of the fragrant limes, Waving to-day as green and gay As in their vanished times. Fair, be sure, was this great lady, Eyes, I guess, whose blue, Cold and calm, but beaming steady, Tender seemed and true. Certes! of a noble presence, Dutiful and staid, Worthinesse was glad before her, Worthlessnesse dismayed. Read beneath, in golden letters Proudly written down, Names of all her ‚Äúsonnes and daughteres!‚Äù Each a matron-crown: Deftly carved in ruff and wimple, Kneeling figures show Small heads over smaller, rising In a solemn row. These her triumphs:‚Äîsterner token Chronicles her Lord! Hangs above him, grim and broken, Gilded helm and sword: Sometimes, when with quire and organ All the still air swings, Red with the rust, and grey with the dust, Low rattles the blade, and rings. Time was, Knight, that tiny treble, Should have stirred thy soul More than drums and trumpets rebel Braying after Noll: No more fight, now!‚Äînay, nor flight, now! The rest which thou hast given In chancel-shade to yon good blade God gives thy soul in Heaven. Somewhere on this summer morning In this English isle, Gleams a cheek whose soft adorning, Lady! wears thy smile! Some one in the Realm, whose fathers Suffered much and long, Owes that sword and its good Lord Thanks for a righted wrong. Therefore for that maiden pray I Dame! God thee assoil! Therefore for that freeman say I Knight! God quit thy toil! And for all Christian men‚Äîand me‚Äî Grace from the gracious Lord To write our name with no more shame, And sheath as clean a sword. June 1857. THE THREE ROSES. ‚ÄúThree roses, wan as moonlight, and weighed down Each with its loveliness as with a crown, Drooped in a florist's window in a town. The first a lover bought. It lay at rest, Like flower on flower that night, on beauty's breast. The second rose, as virginal and fair, Shrank in the tangles of a harlot's hair. The third a widow, with new grief made wild, Shut in the icy palm of her dead child.‚Äù ‚ÄîAldrich, Flower and Thorn. These Roses (in the world we do not see) Strove for the palm. Thus spake the beauteous Three: THE MAIDEN'S ROSE. I am the happiest flower. I lay Dying, as suits sweet blossoms best; It was not pain to pass away Upon her warm and fragrant breast. Blossom on blossoms, so we slept; My odours richer with her breath, My white leaves whitest where I crept Closer, to die delightful death. I heard her secrets, pure and soft; She kissed me, prayed for him, and laid His gift where, since, his cheek full oft Nestles; he knows what words she said: And how, when morn ope'd the bright eyes, She locked me in a casket close; Nothing can take away my prize, The kiss she gave her faded Rose The crown, fair sisters! I must hold; I died upon that heavenly bed; She buried me in silk and gold; I made them lovers, being dead. THE WIDOW'S ROSE. I am the wisest Rose: there lay A dew-drop on me when she shut The little ice-cold palm, and put My blossom there to fade away. It was a tear for her and me That she should grieve, and I should go Clasped in a hand that did not know, And set to eyes that could not see; Torn from my garden green and bright, As he too; first-born of her spring, Once flower-fair, now a lost, dead thing, Hidden with me in graveyard night. But, lo! it was not thus at all! I did not think that flowers could see The wonder of the worlds to be, When the poor leaves of this life fall. For while they wept, and sadly threw The black earth on our coffin-lid, A light came there where we were hid, A wind breathed softer than I knew. There shine no sunbeams so on earth, There is no air blows in such wise As this that swept from Paradise, And turned grave-gloom to grace and mirth. I saw him rise unspeakably; I saw how subtle Life receives New gifts from Death. It was but leaves‚Äî Dead leaves‚Äîwe left there, I and he. And clasped in that small hand I came‚Äî A spirit-Rose as he was spirit‚Äî The further marvels to inherit Of Life, which is for all the same. Crown me, white sisters! When she bent‚Äî That tender mother by his grave‚Äî 'Twas I who, with a rose-waft, gave The thought that filled her with content. THE HARLOT'S ROSE. I was the blessed flower! Give back The crown, dear sisters! for you lack My joy‚Äîyou! that her bosom bore; You they entombed!‚Äîmy deeper lore. 'Twas sweet in lovely death to fade, Rose-blossom on rose-bosom laid; 'Twas rare in grasp of Death, to see The flower of Life blow changelessly. But I, most happy of all three, Rejoice for what he did to me; Binding my bud on locks that rolled Their wasted wealth in rippled gold. For loveless love he set me there; With thankless thanks she found me fair; Laughed with sad eyes to hear him tell The gold, with white and green, ‚Äúwent well.‚Äù We did our kind: she to bestow God's grace in her rich beauty so That good grew evil; I to scent Her steps, and be Sin's ornament. Yet 'twas my duty to seem sweet, She had such bitter bread to eat! She put me at her breast‚ÄîI heard Her heart-beats speaking, without word. ‚ÄúEach spring I plucked such long ago,‚Äù She said‚Äî‚ÄúAh, God! if we could grow Clean like spring roses‚Äîwhite again‚Äî Forgetting last year's rain and stain!‚Äù She said‚Äî‚ÄúAh, God! ah, mother!‚Äîsome Are blooming so about my home, The home-scent makes me dream‚Äîlet be! I have no lover that loves me.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat was it that we read in class? ‚ÄòAnd she supposing Him‚Äô‚Äîalas! ‚ÄòThe gardener.‚Äô Fool! as if God's Son Cares for the flowers that are done!‚Äù Thereat our lips and leaves did kiss‚Äî I was as sweet and soft in this To her as any Rose could be‚Äî ‚ÄúGod's flowers forgive!‚Äù she sighed‚Äî‚ÄúDoth He?‚Äù And fondling me, as though she felt Her mother's kisses on her melt, The tear-drops from her painted lids Ran on the rouge. ‚ÄúWhat eye forbids,‚Äù She said, ‚Äúto try if any hear?‚Äù Mocking herself, she sighed this prayer: ‚ÄúOh, Christ! I am Thy wilted Rose, Renew me! Thou renewest those!‚Äù Then laughed,‚Äîbut did not see, as I, The angels gather at her cry, Their fine plots weaving out of sight To help this soul that strove aright. She did not feel the great wings fold Thenceforward o'er her locks of gold; Nor know thenceforward that the place Was sentinelled by Shapes of grace. But when again she bound her hair, And set me in its tresses fair, I did not ‚Äúshrink,‚Äù (as he has said:) I was too proud! for we were led By holy hands through lane and street, Past things to speak of is not meet; Till when the tender plot had place, God's mercy met her face to face. In all this earth there is not one So desolate and so undone, Who hath not rescue if she knew A heart-cry goes the whole world through. Of thousands cruel one was kind; We found the hand she could not find; The fragrance of me brought her cry‚Äî We saved her; those Wise Ones and I, I and her angels! She hath rest! Of all Rose-service mine was best. Oh, sisters white! no longer boast; Give me the crown! My joy was most! ALLA MANO DELLA MIA DONNA. Listen! poets, loving-hearted, Here abiding‚Äîhence departed; Ye who ranged the realms above Seeking symbols of your love; Provence bards and Persian Saadis Eloquently lauding ladies; Frauenlob‚Äîthe Minnesinger Mourned of maidens,‚Äîand that bringer Of delight to camp and grove, Camoens, the Lord of love; Praise as proudly as ye list, All the honied lips ye kissed; Vaunt your true loves' violet eyes, Vow them bluer than the skies; Swear no south-wind ever came Sweet and soft as she you name; Nor no lily ever grew White as that which bloomed for you! Look! I fling you down a glove In one dear name that I love‚Äî Never hand so fair and fine As my lady's‚ÄîKatharine. Yes! I know it‚ÄîFather Homer! Too long in thy rolls a roamer Not to know how radiant mighty Rose the sea-born Aphrodite; Yes! I know the pearly splendour Of that hand, whose curvings tender, Silver glinting under gold, Combed away the sea-foam bold. And I worship, bending low, Her√´'s awful arm of snow; And of mortal boldness shorn Hail the Rosy-fingered Morn; But those Gods above the thunder Are for fear and reverent wonder; She whose gentle hand I praise Woman is, with woman's ways, And I hold this gage of mine None a hand‚Äîlike Katharine. All the bards that lips have kissed Enter angry on the list, And the legions that appear, Might move any heart to fear. Lo! Athenian Sophocles‚Äî Virgil, too, my fancy sees‚Äî And I sink my spear-head bright As beseemeth younger knight; And I kneel, but not to yield, For I keep the tented field‚Äî Vowing no such hand was seen Were Electra twice a Queen, And Lavinia's hue as fair As 'twas bragged in Latin air: Nay, nor faulter for Sybilla, Or the careless-eyed Camilla, Though her wounded wrist did shine Likest ‚Äúivory, stained with wine;‚Äù Let them go, my noble Masters, With a sigh for Love's disasters, And the challenge‚Äînone so fine! None a hand‚Äîlike Katharine. Dante! spirit sad and lone! Laughing love thou hast not known; Weeping love attends on thee, With its mortal mystery; And thine Angel, Beatrice, Aweth with her hand of ice. Thou Petrarca! dost thou frown? Lay thy latest sonnet down! Set thy shining lance in rest! For I tilt upon thy breast: Say'st thou, ‚Äúlike a curving shell, Where the tender pink does dwell,‚Äù Gleamed thy Laura's milky hand, Lo! I read it! and I stand Firm of foot to make it seem, Even so my Love's doth gleam, And this gentle hand of mine Gave a heart‚Äîthus did not thine. Ah! Dan Chaucer!‚Äîart thou he, Morning star of minstrelsy? Eldest of the English quire, Highest hill‚Äîtouched first with fire. Pass! no bow of mine is bent At the heart where I have leant, And thy dream of Marguerite Was a vision of my Sweet. Next to thee what champions come? There be valorous poets some‚Äî Other some whose steel I scorn In unknightly hands yborne; At the last a Minstrel proud Rideth high amid the crowd, Knight of Lady Una he, And I do him courtesy; Yet though ‚Äúwhither than the snow‚Äù Gleamed that noble Dame, I trow, White as snow, and therewith warm Is my Lady's loving arm, And not golden Oriana, Nor maid Amoret's high manner, Waved a hand as white and fine As the hand of Katharine. Com'st thou Tasso, with thy crew, Eastern-aired Armida too? Oh! a lustrous lady she, ‚ÄúBeautiful, exceedingly;‚Äù But her Asian soul I doubt, Looking from those large eyes out; And her white wrist plays a part, Beating not as beats her heart; Hence, Enchantress! hence, too, thou Mistress of the southern brow; Though thou be'st Boccaccio's best ‚ÄúBocca bacciata‚Äù hath no zest! After thee there floats another Like as sister of one mother, Ariosto's Angelique, Hide her hand, and hide her cheek! Let a nobler Dame have life Led by nobler knight to strife‚Äî High born, great, and graceful too All thy loving songs are true; Swear, Lord Surrey, stoutly swear, Was never woman half so fair? And I will swear that Geraldine Had no such hand as Katharine. Nay! high poets, let it be Thine to thee, and mine to me, For I see th' accepted King Of all earthly minstrelling, Crowned with homely Avon lilies As his regal way and will is. Mighty Master! let me speak; Though Queen Cleopatra's cheek Shamed the rosy lotus-dyes, And her hand in Anthony's Whiter than dove's milky wing, Lay a plaything for a King; Yet, an' thou shalt pardon yield, Thus I leave the foughten field, All as fair and yet more true Than was known to one but you, Is that fair frank hand of mine That gave to me Katharine? January 1856. THE HYMN OF THE PRIESTESS OF DIANA. Oh, of all maidens Mistress! Help at need Of souls unstained, and bosoms virginal! With vervain and with fragrant gums we feed The flame that burned, and burns, and ever shall; Feed thou the fire that flames with holy thought, And let the world to thy white shrine be brought. The altar-light, mounting to find thy face, Gleams back upon us from the brow divine, Filling with placid splendour all the place: Fill so the earth, supremest Goddess mine! That men, awaking out of fancied light, May know it, matched with Dian's noon-time‚Äî night. O brow, where shame can never come to sit! O cheek of snow, which blush can never melt! O ear, that hears no word or wish unfit! O breast, which thought unsainted never felt! Show thyself, Dian! unto other eyes As unto ours, thy deep-sworn votaries. For we, who round about thine altar go, Thou Daughter of the Father of the world! Know thee divinest;‚Äîif men knew thee so Then were the false gods from their temples hurled; And mortals, leaving blind and sinful yearning, Should scorn false beauty, beauty true discerning. Queen of the quiet sky!‚Äîthe night's full Moon! Be moon! and pierce the darkness of this cloud, Whereunder wander, in a dreamful swoon, The fellows of our blood, a witless crowd; Send thou the silver ray that lightens this; Show them the path which goes by good to bliss. Huntress of noble harts‚Äîhigh-purposed Maid! Whose sandal tied for free and fearless chase Is fairer than the cestus proud, displayed By her of Cyprus‚Äîstand in pride of place Before the eyes of men, and lead them on To hunt beside thee, turning off for none. Ah, bliss! beside thee‚Äîby thee‚Äîin thy spirit‚Äî The chase of life along the years to lead, Conquering desire by high desire to merit The joy of joys, the love of loves, the meed Of untold peace, waiting th' unshaken faith Firm held through life, in full repose on death. For Thou, of all the gods, hast these to give‚Äî The kingdom of a calm and equal mind; The kiss‚Äîcold, true,‚Äîbidding the soul's life live To meet caresses, tarrying yet behind, But past hope tender, like the dreams the moon Left on the forehead of Endymion. Eheu! we speak of things we cannot know, And knowing, in this presence we were dumb; But on the winds which round thy portal go Echoes from Aphrodite's revels come, Marring our hymns. High Goddess! make men see The ‚ÄúFoam-Born's‚Äù beauty but a blot to thee. INSCRIBED ON A SKULL PICKED UP ON THE ACROPOLIS AT ATHENS. I am the skull of Nedjm, a Turk, Who fought at Athens with the Giaour; When cannon-balls were hard at work Shattering the Parthenon‚Äîthat hour A classic fragment took me fair Under the waist-cloth, and so made ‚ÄúRuins‚Äù of me. For long years there My remnants with the rest have laid. Scant burial got we from the Greek‚Äî The green fly and the hooded crow Helped the hot sun to leave me sleek, Till, as thou seest, my pate did grow White as new Parian. At the last A Briton spied me, as he passed Roaming the strewed Acropolis, And lightly fashioned me to this. Drink! if thou wilt; and, drinking, say Never did ancient craftsman make Cyathus, Krater, Patera Fitter a mighty thirst to slake. But! call not me a thing of the clod! The Parthenon owned no such plan! Man made that temple for a God, God made these temples for a man! THE NEW LUCIAN. [To H. D. Traill, Esq., on the Dedication of his book, ‚ÄúThe New Lucian.‚Äù] ‚ÄúAt that eternal parting of the ways,‚Äù Thou say'st, good Friend! looking to see it come When hands which cling, unclasp; arms disembrace; And lips, that murmured love to lips, are dumb. Aye! it will come‚Äîthe bitter hour!‚Äîbut bringing A better love beyond, more subtle-sweet; A higher road to tread; with happier singing, And no cross-ways to part familiar feet! Smil'st thou, my later Lucian! knowing too well Hope's under-ache, Faith's fallacies all sped? Yet that which gave thee thy fair gift, to tell How in Elysium chat th' unsilenced Dead, Shall some day whisper: ‚ÄúLo! the Life Immortal! Enter! for thee stands wide the golden portal!‚Äù FACIES NON OMNIBUS UNA. Not a life below the sun But is precious‚Äîunto one! Not an eye, however dull, But seems‚Äîsomewhere‚Äîbeautiful; Not a heart, howe'er despised, But is passioned for and prized. Fool! who laughs at lack of graces, Each man hath a many faces! HAVELOCK IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE. The foot set firm,‚Äîthe hand upon the hilt,‚Äî The warrior-gaze,‚Äîas innocent of fear As any maid's of shame,‚Äîwhich, past the guilt And blood and battle, sees the triumph clear; Stand so in bronze!‚Äîlarge to thy levelled eye, In the supreme imperial peril dawning, ‚ÄúHoc signo vinces‚Äù shines upon the sky; And calm as one who knows his Master's warning; Stand thou in bronze!‚Äîstand! what thou wert, a rock Whereon Rebellion's yeasty billows breaking, Drove wave on wave,‚Äîdashed high‚Äîand from the shock Fell back in shattered foam;‚Äîthyself unshaking: So stand!‚Äîthe busy feet of men go by thee, Each one to-day the safer for that sword; Meeanee's just and valiant chief is nigh thee, Palmerston; Beaconsfield; the great Sea-lord; Well met in some far-off serenest session, The unimpassioned rest of great men gone; And here together set‚Äîlove's poor profession!‚Äî In storied effigy, and sculptured stone. Ah! speaking stone, and bronze, cunningly graven To show these Champions of the English name, Are men's hearts such, that knave, and fool, and craven, Can pass ye daily, and be still the same? But, true and faithful servant! somewhere plaining That labour multiplies and wage is none, Read Havelock's history, and thereby gaining The comfort of his courage, copy one Who all life's chilly spring and summer dreary Wrought in pure patience what he found to do, Possessing his own soul‚Äînot once a-weary‚Äî Content, because God was contented too. Wherefrom he hived the honey which is sweetest, The flower of all the flowers of all a life, A wisdom so perfected, so completest, Great soldiers gave him place to stem the strife: Which never given, Havelock's highest glory Had lacked our knowledge, not his Master's praise, One splendid page been lost from England's story, But not one leaf from his immortal bays. Go to! and work‚ÄîGod's servant‚Äîserving men; Bethinking how the ranks closed up, and cried, ‚ÄúWay for the General!‚Äù and his answer then,‚Äî ‚ÄúYou have made way, my lads!‚Äù‚Äîfair time for pride! June 1862. OXFORD REVISITED. Mother! mild Mother! after many years‚Äî So many that the head I bow turns grey‚Äî Come I once more to thee, thinking to say In what far lands, through what hard hopes and fears, 'Mid how much toil and triumph, joys and tears I taught thy teaching; and, withal, to lay At thy kind feet such of my wreaths as may Seem least unworthy. But what grown child dares Offer thee honours, Fair and Queenly One! Tower-crowned, and girdled with thy silver streams, Mother of ah! so many a better son? Let me but list thy solemn voice, which seems Like Christ's, raising my dead: and let me be Back for one hour‚Äîa Boy‚Äîbeside thy knee. May 1883. THE ALTAR OF PITY. [From the ‚ÄúThebais‚Äù of Statius.] In the mid-city‚Äîto no mighty God Dedicate‚Äîrose an altar. Pity built Her gentle seat there, and the miserable Made all its consecration: never lacked That Altar suppliants! none are turned away! Whoso doth ask is heard; for day and night The shrine stands open, and the offering Of woful wail is free. A frugal faith! No spice-fed flames burn there! no costly blood Is shed: with tears‚Äîsalt tears‚Äîthe marble reeks. No image soars above, no bronze hath ta'en Stamp of the Deity! She loves to dwell Deep in the thoughts,‚Äîhid in the aching heart, And ever hath she trembling worshippers: And ever is the spot thick with a throng Sad-faced; the happy only know it not! THE CHOLERA IN ITALY. [Suggested by a sketch of John Millais, Esq., R.A., representing a skeleton shooting an arrow by night into the habitations of a fortified town.] How did it come to his mind? the fleshless and horrible dream‚Äî Gruesome, cruel, and weird‚Äîmaking the murk more grim; Standing stark-naked in bone, which the star-light sets all a-gleam‚Äî Shooting his shot at the town, the little town silent and dim? Said we not, each to the other, ‚ÄúDeath is an Angel of Light!‚Äù While our tears as they rolled gave the lie to our lips? Here's one paints us the thing awful, authentic, aright‚Äî Tells the Truth straight out, from the skull to the spiked toe-tips! So, if you opened this page an idle moment to soothe, Madam! or Sir!‚Äîas may be‚Äîbest close the volume for good; Here's no matter to flatter flesh and blood in their youth! Here's an Artist in earnest‚ÄîDeath's picture on worm-eaten wood! But if you ask what he meant, yonder the Tuscan town lies Under the curtains of midnight, spangled with planet and star, All looking down so calm! so splendid! as if the eyes Of numberless Angels were watching our one little world from afar. And I hear on the rampart-stones the heel of the sentinel ring; And I see him halt and count the chimes of the midnight bell, And he listens towards us here;‚Äî‚ÄúBut 'tis only the cicalas sing!‚Äù And he shoulders his musket again, and passes the word, ‚ÄúAll's well!‚Äù And away, within those walls, I know there is pleasure and pain; (Ah me! the sorrows and joys wherewith one town may be fraught!) There's scented smoke from the censers, where the people pray in vain, And a flare from the pharos-lantern to bring the feluccas to port. And I seem to see in the gleam which hangs all over the town, Cresset lights of a banquet, and merry torchbearers who go‚Äî Their jolly feet false with the wine‚Äîin laughter up and down, With rose-crowns awry on their heads‚Äîand cornets that cheerily blow. Ah, and I know that, beneath the beautiful roof of the night, Bridal couches are spread, and lovers at last are one, Who say, ‚ÄúIf God would will that it never more should be light, Then stay on the other side, and wait till we wish for thee, Sun!‚Äù Laughter, and music, and banquets, and roses, and revelry, And prayers in the churches to please the Keeper of heaven and hell, And the ships with spices and bales ploughing bravely in from the sea, And still that sentinel looks from the wall and cries, ‚ÄúAll's well!‚Äù Doth he not see, close by, this spectre we see so plain, Who blisters the growing grass with the bones of his clattering feet? And makes the still air reek with the fester of live things slain, And turns to corpse-light, on his skull, the star-light holy and sweet? Cannot he hear the Voice‚Äîstill‚Äîsmall‚Äîthat comes with this thing? Drives it, striding along; halts it, elbows and knees, Says to the skeleton bowman, ‚ÄúNow fit thy shaft to the string, Shoot me a shot at the town; for the hour is come to these!‚Äù Cursed Bowman! who shoot'st with an arrow dipped in the pest! Maker of all! Whose will is good, though Thou willest we die! It is changed in that little town from joy at its gayest and best, To cramps that curdle the blood, and tortures that glaze the eye. The sentinel, careless of all, stalks quiet upon the wall; But the pilot has yielded the helm of his vessel with a scream: At the banquet the guests drop dead‚Äîthe worshippers, priests, and all, Fly! ere they chant ‚ÄúAmen;‚Äù‚Äîand that sweet bridal dream, Which the lovers dreamed together‚Äîbut half asleep‚Äîwhile their lips Still kissed, for fear lest a minute from love's brief rapture be took‚Äî Is ended in this, that one from the arms of the other slips, And that other‚Äîchilled by the corpse‚Äîturns corpse herself, at a look. Ah, Thou Lord, Thou God! Who sendest this pestilent wraith! Giver of life, Who hast given the instinct to love to live, Teach us another lesson‚Äîto render it back in faith, When the messenger comes like this, with a ghastly message to give: Ah, Thou Lord, Thou God: our hearts are the little town: At the twanging of that black bow, ill fare they who there do dwell; But help our souls to hear, through the darkness that settles down, Thy sentinel on the wall, crying always to all, ‚ÄúAll's well!‚Äù REST. His Mother was a Prince's child, His Sire a crown√´d King; There lacked not to his splendid lot What power or wealth could bring; Great nobles served him, bending low, Strong captains wrought his will; Fair fortune!‚Äîbut it wearied him, His spirit thirsted still! For him the glorious music rang Of singers, silent long; Grave histories told, in scrolls of old, The strife of right and wrong; For him Philosophy unveil'd Athenian Plato's lore, Might these not serve to fill a heart? Not these! he sigh'd for more! He loved!‚Äîthe truest, newest lip That ever lover pressed, The queenliest mouth of all the south Long love for him confessed: Round him his children's joyousness Rang silverly and shrill, Thrice happy! save that happiness Missed something‚Äîsomething still! To battle all his spears he sent, In streams of winding steel; On breast and head of foeman dead His warhorse set its heel; The jewell'd housings of its flank Swung wet with blood of kings; Yet the rich victory seemed rank With the blood-guilt it brings! The splendid passion seized his soul, To heal, by statutes sage, The ills that bind our hapless kind, And chafe to crime and rage; And dear the people's blessing was, The praising of the poor; But evil stronger is than thrones, And darkness doth endure! He laid aside the sword and pen, And lit the lamp, to wrest From nature's range the secrets strange, The treasures of her breast; And wisdom deep his guerdon was, And wondrous things he knew; Yet from each vanquish'd mystery Some harder marvel grew! No pause! no respite! no sure ground, To stay the spirit's quest! In all around not one thing found So good as to be ‚Äúbest;‚Äù Not even love proved quite divine; Therefore his search did cease, Lord of all gifts that life can give Save the one sweet gift‚ÄîPeace! Then came it!‚Äîcrown, sword, wreath‚Äîeach lay, An unregarded thing! The funeral sheet from head to feet, Was mantle to that king! And, strange!‚ÄîLove, learning, statecraft, sway, Look'd always on before, But those pale, happy, lips of clay, Asked nothing!‚Äînothing more! THE WRECK OF THE ‚ÄúNORTHERN BELLE.‚Äù Fair sight! for a crew Of Englishmen true, When homeward their course they hold, With sails bleached white By the tropic light, And sheathing a-glitter like gold; Fair sight! from the rails, ‚ÄîWhen the Topman hails ‚ÄúLand ho! on the larboard!‚Äù‚Äîto see The green waves leap At the white cliff's steep On the shore of the land of the free:‚Äî Fair music they make together, The cliff and the climbing foam; And it sounds in the bright blue weather Like the wanderer's welcome home. But when the east wind howleth, And the great seas rise and rave, Another sight Is that belt of white, And another sound's on the wave; Small welcome for wildered vessel, When the billows, giant and grey, Break‚Äîsworn on the sand Her keel to strand, And her ribs on the rocks to lay! Oh! the silver gates of your island Were liker the gates of hell, In the mist of that winter morning To the crew of the ‚ÄúNorthern Belle.‚Äù We left New York for London, (And the wind left with us too!) We thrashed our way Through Atlantic spray, And ran the Channel through; 'Twas three on the morning of Monday When we let the anchors go Ten cables, or more, From Kingsgate shore, To ride out the storm and snow; Ten cables from where green meadows, And quiet homes could be seen, No greater space From peril to peace‚Äî But the savage sea between! Yet a greater space To us had been grace, For still as we neared the shore, The wild white roll of the waves on the shoal Roared round us more and more; Roared out, in a ring around us, You might see them fore and aft, On ragged ledge, And splintered edge, All mad to dash our craft; While the weltering rocks, With their sea-weed locks Awash in the whirling froth, Stood up like slaves Of the winds and waves, Waiting to wreak their wrath. Not yet, brave ship! For the anchor's grip Is fast in the ooze and shell; The gusts may shake, And the great surge break, But the iron holds her well. If a smith could tell, As his sledge-hammer fell, That each little link should hold The craft and the crew, And their lives' hope too, His strokes would be strong and bold! Ease, ease, mad strain! Hold, hold, good chain! We freshened the hawse once more; 'Twas ten of the day, And the vessel lay Stern on to the snow-dimmed shore. And now from the town They hurry down, For the cry is ‚ÄúA Wreck!‚Äù ‚ÄúA Wreck!‚Äù (Ah! under their tread Is the firm green mead, 'Neath ours but the slippery deck). Kind souls! they shout! Look! yonder comes out A lugger from off the land, Brave crew and craft!‚Äî Ready fore and aft!‚Äî She will lend us a helping hand: 'Bout ship! so, so! She stays,‚Äîyes! no! Port, port! ah Heaven! that sea‚Äî Gone‚Äîvessel and men While the heart beats ten! Gone,‚Äîdrowned, for their charity! Rose from each lip On shore, and ship, A cry, a groan, a prayer; While the nine hearts brave Went under the wave, And their death-cry hung in air; No seaman but felt His man's heart melt;‚Äî But the masts were down ere now, And the raffle and wreck, Scarce clear of the deck, Hung, fouling the larboard bow; So we shouted at last, ‚ÄúClear away that mast Or else we are ill bested! God take those home! When our turn's come The dead can bury the dead.‚Äù Thus, all that day, In snow and spray, For dear life still we toiled; And faint and few The bold words grew As nearer the breakers boiled; And still, like a steed Reined back at speed, The ship did plunge and rear; While the burly main Strove on in vain To crack our cable and gear: Till the twilight gloom, Like the earth on the tomb, Came over, and hid the town; And the last we could see, They were busy a-lee Dragging the life-boats down. Ah me! no boat In that surf could float, No oarsmen cleave a way; No eye so bright As to pierce the night That on land and water lay: Oh! leaden dark! That left no spark Of star, in the wild wet sky, Not one pale ray To glimmer and say That God and help were nigh. The timbers racked, The cables cracked, Wilder the waters dashed; Ease her! no need‚Äî The ship is freed! She drove,‚Äîshe rose,‚Äîshe crashed! Then settled and fell The ‚ÄúNorthern Belle,‚Äù As one who no more strives; But the foremast stood, Good Canada wood, With nine and twenty lives: If dreadful the day As none can say, Oh! the night was terribler far, As each man clung To the shrouds, or hung Ice-cold, on the icy spar; And hearts beat slow, As the night did go, Like a lazily-ticking clock; Till we longed to drop From the dripping top Nor wait for the last sure shock. Then, while she did grind, We called to mind Each one, his own home-place, New Jersey towns, And Connecticut downs, And the pleasant meadows of maize: We thought of brothers, And wives and mothers, With whom we should never be; Of our babies playing, Or perhaps a prayer saying For ‚Äúdaddy,‚Äù far off at sea; And we said prayers To mingle with theirs, And held for the daylight still, Which came anon When hope was gone As God's best mercies will. For, soon as the clouds, Like great grey shrouds, Let out the Lazarus-light, We looked to land And saw on the sand, Good God! a cheery sight;‚Äî Seven noble men (Christ save them, then!) That would not see us drown, With oars in hand, And the life-boat manned, (The life-boat dragged from the town;) And they gave us a cheer We could plainly hear, Which we answered with aching throat: Ah then! dear life! To watch the strife Between the storm and the boat. More strong and steep The waves did leap For every stroke she made; As they were bound To see us drowned, And would not be gainsayed: ‚ÄúNow, now! ah now! Pull bow! pull bow! Oh! yonder swells a sea, She swamps!‚Äîno! no! Thank God, not so! She rounds beneath our lee,‚Äù ‚ÄîThrice with a freight Of lives they fight Their way‚Äîstern down and stem‚Äî Then‚Äîsafe and sound, On the English ground! Thanks to the Lord, and them. Look ye, mates mine! There be stories fine Of Greek and Roman deed; But when all's done There was never one Of better help at need. Which man of our crew, My messmates true, But holds his life a gift From those brave Seven, Henceforward, please Heaven, To be used with thoughtful thrift! To be held on earth For service of worth, Save when Englishmen cry‚Äîand then Come storm, come slaughter, To be spent like water For the sake of the Kingsgate men. There are those at home, When the news is come, Will crowd to hear of the ship, With great tears rounding, And glad hearts bounding, And blessings a-pant on the lip. There are girls there, plenty, Not come to twenty, Too shy and demure to speak, Real ladies,‚Äîwould kiss For love of this, Each man of that crew on his cheek: Ay! count it grand To touch but a hand Of the Seven, who staked their lives, Lost seamen to save From a cold sea-grave, And send them to sisters and wives. I'll say one thing Before I bring This plain sea-song to its end, Such hearts of gold, More than state-craft old, Will help all quarrels to mend. America sent, With warm intent, Your ship for a new-year's token, You give her back Our lives from wrack, Shall such friends ever be broken? No! no! they shall stand Hand fast in hand, All sisterly‚Äîside by side‚Äî And none ever tell Of the ‚ÄúNorthern Belle,‚Äù Save with flushes and smiles of pride. Yet more's to do,‚Äî That first boat's crew In this verse shall be given, That Yankee boys With a ready voice May say the list of the Seven. The men I write In the ‚ÄúMary White,‚Äù George Castle's boat, did go‚Äî John, Castle's brother, George Fox, another, Ned Emptage and Jem Rowe‚Äî Those gallant five Did save alive Our crew from the ‚ÄúNorthern Belle,‚Äù With Robert Miller And William Hiller I have no more to tell. Hastings, Jan. 23, 1857. A HOME SONG. The swallow is come from his African home To build on the English eaves; The Sycamore wears all his glistering spears, And the Almond rains roseate leaves; And‚Äîdear Love!‚Äîwith thee, as with bird and with tree, 'Tis the time of blossom and nest, Then, what good thing of the bountiful Spring Shall I liken to thee‚Äîthe best? Over the streamlet the rose-bushes bend Clouded with tender green, And green the buds grow upon every bough, Though as yet no rose-tint is seen; Like those, thou art come to thy promise of bloom, Like theirs, thine shunneth the light; Break, rose-bud!‚Äîand let a longing heart know If the blossom be red or white! Up the broad river with swelling sails, A glorious vessel goes, And not more clear in the soft blue air Than in the still water she shows! Dost thou not go with as brave a show, And, sooth, with as swelling a state? Oh, come into harbour with that thou bear'st, Dear ship!‚Äîfor I eagerly wait. Fair ship!‚Äîah, Kate! none beareth a freight As precious and rich as thine, And where's the rose-bush that will burgeon and blush With a blossom like thine and mine? ‚ÄîWell! well!‚Äîwe do, as the meadow birds too, Since meadows with gold were dyed, The hen sits at rest in the hidden nest, And her mate sings glad at her side. Swanscombe, April 1857. FOND FANCIES. Fond fancies, past the telling, Come o'er me‚Äîidly spelling The mystic meanings dwelling In what these Hindoos taught; So fast they rise‚Äîand faster, That I bid them over-master Slow study;‚Äîand far past her Carry my willing thought! Carry my thoughts, confessing Each dear and separate blessing, (Ah! how beyond expressing, Except with eyes, sweet wife!) Each help, from Love's hid heaven, That thy gentle soul has given To a soul else overdriven In the eager race of life. Sweetheart! how dull beside them Seems all that would outpride them! How weak, what may betide them To bring to fall or fear This joy to live together In changeless summer weather! No clouds to gloom or gather! No seasons in our year! Past all weak words the pleasure, The luxury, the treasure, Of knowing without measure This fondness fully-grown; So that love, no more careful, Nor fanciful, nor fearful, Takes‚Äîheart, and eye, and ear-full‚Äî The love that is its own! Let go old legends! sweeter Than fruit of lotus-eater, Diviner and completer, Than Circe's anodyne; To lessen sadness sent us, And to double gladness lent us, The true, unpressed, nepenthos Is true love's honey-wine! Let go the pride of learning, The foolishness of spurning Life's life, for large discerning Of vain philosophies! ‚ÄúThe highest truth lies nearest!‚Äù 'Twas a Greek said it, Dearest! Of sages the sincerest, Grey old Pheidippides! And let go that mad battle Which tempts us, with its rattle To join‚Äîlike June-mad cattle, In sinful strife for place! The sin is not worth sinning; The end mocks the beginning; The only prize worth winning Is ours, without the race! Therefore, when fears do fret me, Whenever wild winds threat me, I fold my sails and get me To the harbour of thy breast; Safe there from outer riot, Like a bird whom fierce hawks fly at, Escaped, and brooding quiet Down in his happy nest! June 1860. HE AND SHE. ‚ÄúShe is dead!‚Äù they said to him. ‚ÄúCome away; Kiss her! and leave her!‚Äîthy love is clay!‚Äù They smoothed her tresses of dark-brown hair; On her forehead of marble they laid it fair: Over her eyes, which gazed too much, They drew the lids with a gentle touch; With a tender touch they closed up well The sweet thin lips that had secrets to tell; About her brows, and her dear, pale face They tied her veil and her marriage-lace; And drew on her white feet her white silk shoes;‚Äî Which were the whiter no eye could choose! And over her bosom they crossed her hands, ‚ÄúCome away,‚Äù they said,‚Äî‚ÄúGod understands!‚Äù And then there was silence;‚Äîand nothing there But the Silence‚Äîand scents of the eglantere, And jasmine, and roses, and rosemary; For they said, ‚ÄúAs a lady should lie, lies she!‚Äù And they held their breath as they left the room, With a shudder to glance at its stillness and gloom. But he‚Äîwho loved her too well to dread The sweet, the stately, the beautiful Dead,‚Äî He lit his lamp, and took the key, And turned it!‚ÄîAlone again‚Äîhe and she! He and she; but she would not speak, Though he kiss'd, in the old place, the quiet cheek; He and she; yet she would not smile, Though he called her the name that was fondest erewhile; He and she; and she did not move To any one passionate whisper of love! Then he said, ‚ÄúCold lips! and breast without breath; Is there no voice,‚Äîno language of death, ‚ÄúDumb to the ear, and still to the sense, But to heart and to soul distinct,‚Äîintense? ‚ÄúSee, now,‚ÄîI listen with soul, not ear‚Äî What was the secret of dying, Dear? ‚ÄúWas it the infinite wonder of all, That you ever could let life's flower fall? ‚ÄúOr was it a greater marvel to feel The perfect calm o'er the agony steal? ‚ÄúWas the miracle greater to find how deep, Beyond all dreams, sank downward that sleep? ‚ÄúDid life roll backward its record, Dear, And show, as they say it does, past things clear? ‚ÄúAnd was it the innermost heart of the bliss To find out, so, what a wisdom love is? ‚ÄúOh, perfect Dead! oh, Dead most dear, I hold the breath of my soul to hear; ‚ÄúI listen‚Äîas deep as to horrible hell, As high as to heaven! and you do not tell! ‚ÄúThere must be pleasures in dying, Sweet, To make you so placid from head to feet! ‚ÄúI would tell you, Darling, if I were dead, And 'twere your hot tears upon my brow shed. ‚ÄúI would say, though the Angel of death had laid His sword on my lips to keep it unsaid. ‚ÄúYou should not ask, vainly, with streaming eyes, Which in Death's touch was the chiefest surprise; ‚ÄúThe very strangest and suddenest thing Of all the surprises that dying must bring.‚Äù Ah! foolish world! Oh! most kind Dead! Though he told me, who will believe it was said? Who will believe that he heard her say, With the soft rich voice, in the sweet old way:‚Äî ‚ÄúThe utmost wonder is this,‚ÄîI hear, And see you, and love you, and kiss you, Dear; ‚ÄúI can speak, now you listen with soul alone; If your soul could see, it would all be shown ‚ÄúWhat a strange delicious amazement is Death, To be without body and breathe without breath. ‚ÄúI should laugh for joy if you did not cry; Oh, listen! Love lasts!‚ÄîLove never will die. ‚ÄúI am only your Angel who was your Bride; And I know that, though dead, I have never died.‚Äù ON A DEAD LADY. Non pu√≤ far Morte il dolce viso amaro, Ma 'l dolce viso dolce pu√≤ far Morte. Death cannot change her face, tender and fair! 'Tis she who changes Death, and makes him dear. SERENADE. Lute! breathe thy lowest in my Lady's ear, Sing while she sleeps, ‚ÄúAh! belle dame, aimezvous?‚Äù Till, dreaming still, she dream that I am here, And wake to find it, as my love is, true; Then, while she listens in her warm white nest, Say in slow music,‚Äîsofter, tenderer yet, That lute-strings quiver when their tone's at rest, And my heart trembles when my lips are set. Stars! if my sweet love still a-dreaming lies, Shine through the roses for a lover's sake; And send your silver to her lidded eyes, Kissing them very gently till she wake; Then, while she wonders at the lay and light, Tell her, though morning endeth star and song, That ye live still, when no star glitters bright, And my love lasteth, though it finds no tongue. LYDIA. [From Horace.] He. As long as I was dear to you, and none‚Äî Not one, save I‚Äî Dared lock his arms about your neck, the Sun Saw no King happier underneath the sky. She. As long as you loved Lydia more than all, And Chloe's face Had not made Lydia's naught, men might me call The happiest girl of all the Roman race. He. Well! now, that's past! and Chloe binds my heart With lute and voice; Whom so I love that, if Death's fatal dart, Aimed at her life, struck mine, I should rejoice. She. Ah! yes‚Äî'tis past! I love a Thurian boy, Who dotes on me; And for his dear sake I would die with joy, Nay, or twice over‚Äîwere the thing to be. He. But‚Äîjust suppose‚Äîthe old love could come back As good as new! That Chloe with her golden hair should pack, And my heart open all its gates to you! She. Supposing that‚Äîoh! well!‚Äîmy Thurian's dear, And you‚Äîalas! Are wild as Adria, and more light than air, Yet, Love! with you life and dark Death I'd pass. DANTE AND HIS VERSES. [From the French.] Dante had writ two lines:‚Äîthe lines Talked;‚ÄîQuoth the one, ‚ÄúFame's gateway shines Open for us.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh! 'tis but ink We are!‚Äù says t'other. ‚ÄúDost thou think Thoughts perish?‚Äù the first line replied; ‚ÄúWhat's Thought but Nought?‚Äù the second cried. ‚ÄúNay! feel'st thou not th' immortal stir In every word and character?‚Äù Asks one. Sighs t'other, ‚ÄúNot a jot! I feel dead letters!‚Äù To the spot Comes Dante, reads his lines;‚Äîthinks deep:‚Äî Then blots one verse, and one will keep. They knew!‚Äîhis pen was Destiny! One was to live, and one to die. AMADIS OF GAUL TO DON QUIXOTE DE LA MANCHA. [From the Spanish.] Thou, who didst imitate the mournful manner Of my most lonely and despis√´d life, And‚Äîleaving joy for suffering and strife‚Äî Upon the bare hill-side didst pitch thy banner! Thou, whose unsham√´d eyes with tears oft ran o'er‚Äî Salt, dripping tears!‚Äîwhen, giving up all proper Vessels of use, silver, and tin, and copper, Thou atest earth's herbs on the earth,‚Äîa woeful dinner! Rest thou content, Sir Knight! Ever and ever‚Äî Or, at the least, while thro' the hemispheres Golden Apollo drives his glittering mares‚Äî Famous and praised shall be thy high endeavour! Thy land of birth the glory of all nations! Thy chronicler's, the crown of reputations! THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS. [Suggested by the well-known picture of Mr. Holman Hunt, in which the uplifted form of Christ, resting with extended arms from His labour in the carpenter's shop at Nazareth, throws upon the wall of the Virgin's house a figure of a Cross.] Light and Shadow! Shadow and Light! Twins that were born at the birth of the sun! One the secret of all things bright; The secret of all things sombre, one; One the joy of the radiant day; One the spell of the dolorous night: One at the dew-fall bearing sway; One at the day-break, rosy and white. Sister and brother, born of one mother, Made of a thought of the Infinite One Made by the wisdom of God‚Äîand none other‚Äî In times when the times were not begun. One with the morning-star for its gem, Glad E√∂sphorus, herald of beams; One that wears for its diadem Pale, sad Hesperus, planet of dreams. One for the glory and one for the gloom; One to show forth and one to shroud; One for the birth and one for the tomb; One for the clear sky and one for the cloud. Sister and brother, for ever and ever, Nowise disparted, and nowhere a-twain; Mysteries no man's thinking shall sever; Marvels none can miss, or explain. Light, which without a shadow shines not! Shadow, which shows not unless by light! (For that which we see to sight combines not, Except by the sides that escape the sight.) Is this the parable? this the ending? That nothing lives for us unless with a foil; That all things show by contrast and blending‚Äî Pleasure by Pain, and Rest by Toil? Strength by Weakness, and Gladness by Sorrow; Hope by Despair, and Peace by Strife; The Good by the Evil, the Day by the Morrow; Love by Hatred, and Death by Life? Ah! then I hate you, Shadow! Shadow! Ghost and ghoul of the glittering Light! If the gold of wisdom, the El Dorado Of Art must be had in this sorrowful sight. Shadow! we know how lovely and tender Are the deeds you do with your witchcraft dim; What wonderful sorcery tempers the splendour Of light, in your sisterly play with him! We know what rose-leaf lips would be cold Without the soft finish of warm half-light; We know what tresses would lose their gold If you did not gloss it and gild it aright. We know how weary the dawns would go Lacking the promise of placid eves; We know how fiercely the hours could glow Without the kind shadows under the leaves; Yes! and we know how joy would tire, And gladness turn madness, and life be undone; And strength prove weakness, and Hope expire, And Love droop wingless, if change were none. And, Holiest Shadow of God's great hand!‚Äî That makest the sleep and the spangled night‚Äî I know that by Thee we understand The stars which in silver His glories write. And we seem to know that, to eyes like ours, Dawn by Dusk must usher its state; That hearts win hope from the darkest hours, And Love kisses best with a shudder at Hate. But, Shadow! Shadow! Ghost of the Light! Be Sadness! be Softness! be solemn Gloom! Be Death! be Doubt! be the secret of Night! Be the spell of Beauty! but past the tomb Thou wendest not with us, accursed Shadow! That makest a fable of all real things:‚Äî The gold of wisdom, the El Dorado Of art, a happier musing brings Far off‚Äîworlds off‚Äîin the Pleiads seven Is a Star of the Stars‚ÄîAlcyon√´‚Äî The orb which moves never in all the Heaven, The centre of all sweet Light we see. And there, thou Shadow of Earth's pale seeming! The wisest say no shadow can be, But perfect splendours, lucidly streaming, And Life and Light at intensity. Then why did the artist show it thus‚Äî The Sorrow of Sorrows personified‚Äî Painting the carpenter's Son for us And the Shadow behind of the Crucified? Meek and sweet in the sun He stands, Drinking the air of His Syrian skies; Lifting to Heaven toil-wearied hands, Seeing ‚ÄúHis Father‚Äù with those mild eyes; Gazing from trestle and bench and saw, To the Kingdom kept for His rule above. O Christ, the Lord! we see with awe! Ah! Joseph's son! we look with love! Ah! Mary Mother! we watch with moans Marking that phantom thy sweet eyes see, That hateful Shadow upon the stones, That sign of a coming agony! Did it happen so once in Nazareth? Did a Christmas sun show such a sight, Making from Life a spectre of Death, Mocking our ‚ÄúLight of the World‚Äù with Light? He tells us‚Äîthis artist‚Äîone Christmas-tide, The sunset painted that ominous Cross; The shadows of evening prophesied The hyssop to Him, and to us the loss. For, her pang is the pang of us, every one: Wherever the Light shines the Shadow is; Where beams a smile must be heard a moan; The anguish follows the flying bliss. Yon crown which the Magi brought to her, It makes a vision of brows that bleed; Yon censer of spikenard and balm and myrrh, It looks on the wall like a ‚Äúsponge and reed.‚Äù And, therefore, long ago was it written‚Äî Of a Christmas to come in the realms of Light‚Äî ‚ÄúThe curse shall depart and death shall be smitten, And then there shall be no more night.‚Äù O Christ, our Lord, in that Shadowless Land, Be mindful of these sad shadows which lie! Look forth and mark what a woeful band Of glooms attend us across Thy sky! ‚ÄúChristmas!‚Äù and hear what wars and woe! ‚ÄúChristmas!‚Äù and see what grief o'er all! Lord Christ! our suns shine out to show Crosses and thorns on Time's old wall! So, if Thou art where that star gleams, Alcyon√´, or higher still, Send down one blessed ray which beams Free of all shadows‚Äîfor they kill! CHRIST BLESSING LITTLE CHILDREN. [Suggested by the picture of Rembrandt in the National Gallery.] Master, well done! thy sombre colours stoop, As what they paint did, to the root of things! Thy Christ hath eyes, whose weary glances droop, Marred with much love, and all the ache it brings: Thy children‚Äîsoft, albeit, their Syrian grace‚Äî Clasp sun-burnt breasts, and drink of milk that cost Sweat to provide it; from each mother's face Is gone the bridal beauty; lapsed and lost Bliss from these bondsmen; yet, how the Divine Breaks through the clay! how Truth's gold gilds the story! How longing for heaven's light makes earth's gloom shine! How lovely, at its lowest, is love's glory! We see Him as He sate in Palestine. Lord Christ! these are the little ones that come! Thou spakest, ‚ÄúSuffer them;‚Äù yea, Thou didst say, ‚ÄúForbid them not, for in my kingdom some Are like to such!‚Äù O Lord! do Angels lay Small aching heads on sorrow-laden bosoms? Do Thy young angels toil, and starve, and weep? Hardly for these will ope life's morning blossoms Before their days bring griefs, their nightly sleep Dreams of the Roman whip. Ah, Master Mild! Be some great secret of Thy kingdom said To keep the grown man glad as this male child, The woman pure as is that tender maid! They ‚Äúsee Thy Father's face!‚Äù Then, how beguiled? Little sweet sister, standing at His knee! Small peasant sister! sucking at thy thumb, Touched to thy tiny heart with the mystery, Glad to be brought, but far too shy to come; Ah! tremble, but steal closer; let it cover All of thy head, that potent, piteous hand; And, mothers! reach your round-eyed babies over To take their turn, nought though they understand. For these thereby are safe, being so kissed By that Love's lips which kisses out of heaven; And we, with little children, but no Christ, Press near; perchance the blessing may be given From theirs to ours, though we His face have missed. A DISCOURSE OF BUDDHA. Herewith, a broken gem of Buddha's lore One beamlet of the brightness of his love! Rose-light which lingers when the sun is down Such space that men may find a path thereby. Ananda told his Brethren of the robe In the full Sangha, saying, ‚ÄúI have heard!‚Äù Ananda said: ‚ÄúUpon a certain morn At Rajagriha, in Wasanta-time, Lord Buddha sate‚Äîthe great Tath√¢gato‚Äî Speaking with wayfarers words such as these. There was a temple built to Surya Between the dyers' sheds and grain-market, With white porch sheltered by a peepal-tree; Whereby he sate; and a priest questioned him‚Äî ‚ÄúWhich is Life's chief good, Master?‚Äù And he spake: ‚ÄúShadows are good when the high sun is flaming, From wheresoe'er they fall; Some take their rest beneath the holy temple, Some by the prison-wall. ‚ÄúThe King's gilt palace-roof shuts out the sunshine, So doth the dyers' shed! Which is the chiefest shade of all these shadows?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are alike!‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúSo is it,‚Äù quoth he: ‚Äúwith all shows of living; As shadows fall, they fall! Rest under, if ye must, but question not Which is the best of all. ‚ÄúYet, some trees in the forest wave with fragrance Of fruit and bloom o'erhead; And some are evil, bearing fruitless branches, Whence poisonous air is spread.‚Äù ‚ÄúTherefore, though all be false, seek, if ye must, Right shelter from life's heat. Lo! those do well who toil for wife and child Threading the burning street! ‚ÄúGood is it helping kindred! good to dwell Blameless and just to all; Good to give alms, with goodwill in the heart, Albeit the store be small! ‚ÄúGood to speak sweet and gentle words, to be Merciful, patient, mild; To hear the Law, and keep it, leading days Innocent, undefiled. ‚ÄúThese be chief goods‚Äîfor evil by its like Ends not, nor hate by hate: By love hate ceaseth; by well-doing ill; By knowledge life's sad state. ‚ÄúBut see where soars an eagle! mark those wings Which cleave the blue, cool skies! What shadow needeth yon proud Lord of Air To shield his fearless eyes? ‚ÄúRise from this life; lift upon pinions bold Hearts free and great as his; The eagle seeks no shadow, nor the wise Greater or lesser bliss!‚Äù THE TWELVE MONTHS. JANUARY. Rain‚Äîhail‚Äîsleet‚Äîsnow!‚ÄîBut in my East This is the time when palm-trees quicken With flowers, wherefrom the Arabs' feast Of amber dates will thenceforth thicken. Palms,‚Äîhe and she‚Äîin sight they grow; And o'er the desert-sands is wafted, On light airs of the After-glow, That golden dust whence fruit is grafted. Ah, happy trees! who feel no frost Of winter-time, to chill your gladness; And grow not close enough for cost Of bliss fulfilled, which heightens sadness; No grey reality's alloy Your green ideal can diminish! You have love's kiss, in all its joy, Without love's lips, which let it finish! FEBRUARY. Fair Grecian legend, that, in Spring, Seeking sweet tale for sunnier hours, Fabled how Enna's queen did bring Back from the under-world her flowers! Whence come ye else, goblets of gold, Which men the yellow crocus call? You snowdrops, maiden-meek and cold, What other fingers let you fall? What hand but hers, who, wont to rove The asphodel in Himera, Torn thence by an ungentle love, Flung not her favourites away? King of dark death! on thoughts that roam Thy passion and thy power were spent: When blossom-time is come at home, Homeward the soul's strong wings are bent. So comes she, with her pleasant wont, When Spring-time chases Winter cold, Couching against his frozen front Her tiny spears of green and gold. MARCH. Welcome, North-wind! from the Norland; Strike upon our foremost foreland, Sweep away across the moorland, Do thy lusty kind! Thou and we were born together In the black Norwegian weather; Birds we be of one brave feather, Welcome, bully wind! Buss us! set our girls' cheeks glowing; Southern blood asks sun for flowing, North blood warms when winds are blowing, Most of all winds, thou; There's a sea-smack in thy kisses Better than all breezy blisses, So we know, our kinsman this is: Buss us! cheek and brow. Rollick out thy wild sea-catches, Roar thy stormy mad sea-snatches, What bare masts and battened hatches Thou hast left behind; Ring it, till our ears shall ring, too, How thou mad'st the Frenchman bring-to: That's the music Northmen sing to, Burly brother wind! Go! with train of spray and sea-bird, Fling the milky waves to leeward, Drive the ragged rain-clouds seaward, Chase the scudding ships; To the south wind take our greeting, Bid him bring the Spring‚Äîhis Sweeting‚Äî Say what glad hearts wait her meeting, What bright eyes and lips. APRIL. Blossom of the almond-trees, April's gift to April's bees, Birthday ornament of spring, Flora's fairest daughterling!‚Äî Coming when no flow'rets dare Trust the cruel outer air; When the royal king-cup bold Will not don his coat of gold; And the sturdy blackthorn spray Keeps its silver for the May;‚Äî Coming when no flow'rets would, Save thy lowly sisterhood Early violets, blue and white, Dying for their love of light. Almond blossom, sent to teach us That the spring-days soon will reach us, Lest, with longing over-tried, We die as the violets died. Blossom, clouding all the tree With thy crimson 'broidery, Long before a leaf of green On the bravest bough is seen; Ah! when wintry winds are swinging All thy red bells into ringing, With a bee in every bell, Almond bloom, we greet thee well! MAY. Who cares on the land to stay, Wasting the wealth of a day? The yellow fields leave For the meadows that heave, And away to the sea‚Äîaway! To the meadows far out on the deep, Whose ploughs are the winds that sweep The green furrows high, When into the sky The silvery foam-bells leap. At sea!‚Äîmy bark‚Äîat sea! With the winds, and the wild clouds and me; The low shore soon Will be down with the moon, And none on the waves but we! Thy wings are abroad, my bird, And the sound of their speed is heard; The scud flieth west, And the gull to her nest, But they lag far behind us, my bird! White as my true love's neck Are the sails that shadow thy deck; And thine image wan, Like the stream-mirrored swan, Lies dim on thy dancing track. On! on! with a swoop and a swirl, High over the clear waves' curl; Under thy prow, Like a fairy, now, Make the blue water bubble with pearl! Lo! yonder, my lady, the light! 'Tis the last of the land in sight! Look once‚Äîand away! Bows down in the spray; Lighted on by the lamps of the night! JUNE. Lily of June, pearl-petalled, emerald-leaved! A sceptre thou, a silver-studded wand By lusty June, the Lord of Summer, waved, To give to blade and bud his high command. Nay! not a sceptre, but a seated Bride, The white Sultana of a world of flowers, Chosen, o'er all their passion and their pride, To reign with June, Lady of azure hours. Ah, vestal-bosomed! Thou that, all the May, From maidenly reserve would'st not depart, Till June's warm wooing won thee to display The golden secret hidden at thy heart. Lay thy white heart bare to the Summer King! Brim thy broad chalice for him with fresh rain! Fling to him from thy milky censers, fling Fine fragrances, a Bride without a stain! Without?‚Äîlook, June! thy pearly love is smutched! That which did wake her gentle beauty, slays; Alas! that nothing lovely lasts, if touched By aught more earnest than a longing gaze. JULY. Proud, on the bosom of the river, White-winged the vessels come and go, Dropping down with ingots to deliver, Drifting up stately on the flow. Mirrored in the sparkling waters under, Mightily rising to the sky, Kings of the sunshine and the thunder, Come they and go they, in July. Quiet, in the reaches of the river, Blooms the sea-poppy all alone; Hidden by the marshy sedges ever, Who knows its golden cup is blown? Who cares if far-distant billows, Rocking the great ships to sea, Underneath the tassels of the willows Rock the sea-poppy and the bee? Rock the marsh-blossom with its burden, Only a worker bee at most! Working for nothing but the guerdon To live on its honey in the frost. The outward-bound ye watch, and the incomer; The bee and the blossom none espy! But those have their portion in the summer, In the glad, gold sunshine of July. AUGUST. [From the German.] Once, with a Landlord wondrous fine, A weary guest, I tarried, A golden pippin was his sign, Upon a green branch carried! Mine host‚Äîhe was an apple-tree With whom I took my leisure; Fair fruit, and mellowed juicily, He gave me from his treasure. There came to that same hostel gay Bright guests, in brave adorning; A merry feast they made all day, And sang, and slept till morning. I, too, to rest my body laid On bed of crimson clover; The landlord with his own broad shade Carefully spread me over. I rose;‚ÄîI called to pay the score, But ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù he grandly boweth; Now, root and fruit, for evermore God bless him, while he groweth! SEPTEMBER. The harvest-moon stands on the sea, Her golden rim's adrip; She lights the sheaves on many a lea, The sails on many a ship; Glitter, sweet Queen! upon the spray, And glimmer on the heather; Right fair thy ray to gild the way Where lovers walk together. The red wheat rustles, and the vines Are purple to the foot; And true-love, waiting patient, wins Its blessed time of fruit: Lamp of all lovers, Lady-moon! Light these ripe lips together Which reap alone a harvest sown Long ere September weather. OCTOBER. A bold brunette she is, radiant with mirth, Who comes a-tripping over corn-fields cropped; Fruits and blown roses, from her full arms dropped, Carpet her feet along the gladdened earth; Around her brow glitters a careless crown Of bronz√´d oak, and apple-leaves, and vine; And russet-nuts and country berries twine About her gleaming shoulders and loose gown. Like grapes at vintage, where the ripe wine glows, Glows so her sweet cheek, summer-touched but fair, And, like grape-tendrils, all her wealth of hair, Gold on a ground of brown, nods as she goes: Grapes too, a-spirt, her brimming fingers bear, A dainty winepress, pouring wet and warm The crimson river over wrist and arm, And on her lips‚Äîadding no crimson there! Ah! golden autumn hours‚Äîfly not so fast! Let the sweet Lady long with us delay; The sunset makes the sun so wished-for,‚Äîstay! Of three fair sisters‚Äîloveliest and the last! But after laughter ever follows grief, And Pleasure's sunshine brings its shadow Pain; Even now begins the dreary time again, The first dull patter of the first dead leaf. NOVEMBER. Come! in thy veil of ashen cloud With mists around thee, like a shroud, And wan face coloured with no light Of sun or moon, by day or night; I would not see thee glad and gay Dark month! that called my Love away! I would not see thee otherwise Grey month! that hast the dying eyes; Cold month! that com'st with icy hands Chaining the waters and the lands! So didst thou chill two hearts at play, Dark month! that called my Love away! And yet, I know, behind thy mists The bright Sun shines, Love's star subsists! If we could lift thy veil, may be, Thy hidden face were good to see! Come as thou wilt‚ÄîI say not nay, Dark month! that called my Love away! November 1864. DECEMBER. In fret-work of frost and spangle of snow Unto his end the year doth wend; And sadly for some the days did go, And glad for some were beginning and end! But‚Äîsad or glad‚Äîgrieve not for his death, Mournfully counting your measures of breath, You, that, before the stars began, Were seed of woman and promise of man, You who are older than Aldebaran! It was but a ring round about the Sun, One passing dance of the planets done; One step of the Infinite Minuet Which the great worlds pace, to a music set By Life immortal and Love divine: Whereof is struck, in your threescore and ten, One chord of the harmony, fair and fine, Of that which maketh us women and men! In fret-work of frost and spangle of snow, Sad or glad‚Äîlet the old year go! THE END.</field>
