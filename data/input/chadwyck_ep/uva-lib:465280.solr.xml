      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TRIBUTARY POEMS. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE LATE GENERAL BURGOYNE, Author of the Heiress, a Comedy, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Laura! when from thy beauteous eyes, The tear of tender anguish flows; Such magic in thy sorrow lies, That ev'ry bosom shares thy woes. When on thy lovely perfect face, The sportive dimpled smile we see; With eager hope the cause we trace, And wish to share the bliss with thee. For in thine highly gifted mind, Superior charms so sweetly blend; In each such gentle grace we find, That Envy must thy worth commend! Oh! who could gaze upon that lip, That coral lip of brightest hue; Nor wish the honied balm to sip, More fresh, more sweet, than morning dew? But when thy true poetic lays, Pierce to the Heart's remotest cell; We feel the conscious innate praise, Which feeble language fails to tell. So melting is thy lute's soft tone, Each breast unused to feel desire, Confesses bliss before unknown, And kindles at the sacred fire! So chaste, so eloquent thy song, So true each precept it conveys, That e'en the Sage shall teach the Young To take their lesson from thy lays. And when thy pen's delightful art Paints with soft touch Love's tender flame; Thy verse so melts and mends the heart, That, taught by thee, we prize his name. Or, when in plaintive melody, Thou mourn'st the friend thy soul held dear; Charm'd by thy pow'r, we join with thee, And weep in sadness o'er his bier. Sweet mistress of each yielding heart! Accept the verse to Genius due; No flattery can that Bard impart Who dares address his vows to you. February 1, 1791. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY JAMES BOADEN, Esq. AUTHOR OF Fontainville Forest, The Secret Tribunal, The Fruits of Faction, a Poem, &amp;c. “But Laura still shall dress the lay, “In all the lustre of day, “With such sweet pensiveness complain, “That mortals are in love with pain; “And while the tender notes they scan, “Scarce see the writer is a man.” Laura! the lightnings of thy scorn That pierc'd the timid breast of morn, Borne thro' the vap'ry fields of air, Struck, and rous'd me to a tear. It fell, for who unmov'd could be When the muse sings, and sings by thee? What wretch, by every muse disclaim'd, Can speak of verse when thou art nam'd, And, not as liberal as the day, Pour forth the pæan of thy lay? Does it not fall like fleecy snow Upon the bright'ning plain below? Is it not mild as the blest morn, That empties Amalthæa's horn? Sure, in some niggard barren soil Of vexing stubbornness and toil, With scanty sustenance scarce fed, This rude barbarian must be bred, Whose soul its tribute can refuse, To heav'nly beauty and the muse! But thou pursue thy radiant way, Cheer'd by thy owm meridian ray; Around thee let the beams be hurl'd, That shed a lustre on our world. Blest, that the flashes of thy fire, That soul's congenial best admire: The beamy splendours that they give, No fool can bear to see, and live. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE LATE ROBERT MERRY, Esq. Member of the Academè della Crusca at Florence. Blest daughter of gentleness! child of the muse! Restrain the sweet lay, that so meltingly flows, Tho' its breathings a transport diviner diffuse Than the Nightingale's prayer for the kiss of the rose! Yet, alas! there is anguish and danger to hear;— The spells of the fatal enchanter I prove, His magic dominion in thee I revere, For I know thou art beauty, and feel thou art love! I feel that thy charms can enrapture the view, Thy thought so expansive, so richly refin'd, Has pow'r to disorder, has force to subdue— And I die in adoring thy heart and thy mind. Yet though the rich tribute of merit and fame From taste and discernment thou ever must share, Pale folly and rancour shall fix on thy name, And envy, distracted, be turn'd to despair! When the eagle majestically sails thro' the sky, The owl and the raven are shock'd at the sight, To the caverns of darkness in anguish they fly, And curse with dismay the bold bird of the light. Then, daughter of gentleness, child of the muse! By pity the wretches' resentment control, Let the dull and the dastard aspire to abuse, Be it mine, thou sweet minstrel! to give thee my soul. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE REV. WILLIAM TASKER, Translator of the Classics and Author of “Aviragus,” a tragedy. When Sappho, from the lofty steep, O'erwhelm'd with dire despair, Plung'd headlong in the foaming deep, To end her hopeless care, Venus, who saw the tuneful maid Bend o'er the yawning wave, Sent her own son, the nymph to aid— He came too late to save! But as her trembling spirit rose, To seek its calm abode, Venus, in pity to her woes, This gentle boon bestow'd: “No more the victim of despair “Shall Sappho's spirit rove, “But on the earth, divinely fair, “Claim every gazer's love!” And see! the wondrous nymph appears! More tuneful, more divine; She brings new music from the spheres, And her blest lyre is thine! TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE HONOURABLE JOHN ST. JOHN, Author of “Mary queen of Scots,” an historical Tragedy, “The Island of St. Marguerite,” an Opera, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Congenial spirits own congenial fires, Where vivid fancy every thought inspires; The taste of Reynolds we behold again In ev'ry beauty of thy mournful strain. No envy dims the lustre of thy lays, No mean disguise obscures thy generous praise; But as the tuneful line mellifluous flows, Thy genius kindles, and thy fancy glows! Still, still pursue the lesson truth inspires, Still tune thy harp, amidst exulting fires. And when thy gentle form in death is laid, And all thy wondrous attributes shall fade, The grateful tributary son of woe, Transcendent Sappho! sound thy tomb shall flow. There Middleton's meek shade shall hover near, There Garrick's sainted spirit shall appear, There beauteous Linley raise her angel tongue, And Chatterton shall strike his lyre new strung! And 'midst the mingling sounds thy name shall rise The brightest planet in its “native skies.” IMPROMPTU TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY HIS GRACE THE LATE DUKE OF LEEDS. When sensibility and truth unite To give thy thought with sweet poetic art, 'Tis genuine nature dictates what you write, And ev'ry line's a transcript of your heart! 'Tis grace, and feeling, polish'd by the muse, To claim applause, and charm the wond'ring throng! Then who the sacred laurel shall refuse To her whom nature hails the queen of song. SONNET TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE REV. DR. PAUL COLOMBINE, OF NORWICH. On reading her Legitimate Sonnets. What voice attun'd to the soft Lesbian lute Breathes in this rugged clime such accents clear? What British Sappho warbles thro' the year, When ev'ry grove in Greece is lorn and mute? The Muse and the Graces held dispute, Which at her birth the blooming babe should rear Their blended gifts in her so bright appear. Who would not strive to press the tender suit, To win the beauteous prize? where'er she moves, Whene'er she speaks, she fascinates each eye And winds around each heart: the tender loves, With genius, taste, and varied harmony, So breathe in her soft lay, hoar age approves, While youth, fond youth, dissolves in ecstasy. SONNET TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY JOHN TAYLOR, Esq. Think not thy numbers Sappho's woes declare, And all her fervid passion's fond excess, Though thy rapt Muse's glowing strains express Of Love's sad victims each romantic care, Warning weak hearts to shun the roseate snare; Though Phœbus deigns thy tow'ring flights to bless, And all his Sons thy nobler pow'rs confess That o'er their highest aims sublimely dare. No, Laura, thus pre-eminently taught, Mellifluous warblings of the heav'nly train, With poesy's delightful magic fraught, Yet other notes reveal'd the Lesbian's pain; For, ah! had Sappho's Muse such accents caught, The faithless youth she had not lov'd in vain. SONNET TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY JOHN TAYLOR, Esq. Hail, pensive songstress! whose enchanting lay So sweetly soothes the sadden'd soul to rest; Pathetic sov'reign of the tender breast! Gentle as eve, and lustrous as the day. Whether to plaintive grove thy fancy lead, To hermit's cave, or mountain's trembling height, The battle's sanguine plain, the peaceful mead, Still the fond Muse attends thy fervid flight. Description yields her pencil to thy hand, That pencil fraught with every varying dye, A new creation springs at thy command, And brighter beauties catch the ravish'd eye. Ah! since o'er other hearts so potent known, Why sadly sink the victim of thy own? IMPROMPTU. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE SAME, On receiving her Poems. Ah! fair, dearest Laura, my thanks would I pay, For the treasures of Genius thy friendship bestows; How poor are all thanks to the worth of thy lay, Where the rich ore of poesy lavishly flows. To praise that rich ore too were equally vain; What Muse, but thy own, can its value impart? Yet, when grateful simplicity offers the strain, 'Tis the only reward that is dear to thy heart. Then take, dearest Laura, the tribute sincere, From a friend who admir'd thee in life's early hour; Who beheld in thy bloom, the sweet promise appear, That time has matur'd to so lovely a flow'r. Jan. 9, 1794. BOUQUET FOR MRS. ROBINSON, AN IMPROMPTU, BY THE LATE RICHARD TICKEL, Esq. Written a few Months only previous to his death. The Rose is like thy glowing cheek, When deck'd with tears of pity meek. The Lily, like thy spotless breast, By love's delicious pinions prest. The Blue Bell like thy azure eyes, Where Cupid's wand'ring arrow lies! The Violet like the veins that twine, Along thy oval front, divine! Then, Laura, quick these emblems take, And wear them for the giver's sake. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE SAME. As Lesbos Sappho boasted first in fame! So peerless muse! thy verse adorns our shore; So future Bards shall celebrate thy name, E'en till this little Isle shall be no more! Then mock the venal titles of a day, Nor mourn of worldly gifts—a niggard store; Thy Genius shines with such a vivid ray, As makes the gems of fortune dimly poor! For when, in shrouded dust, the dull and vain Shall moulder, lost, forgotten, or unknown, The pensive eye shall pour upon thy strain, And thy illustrious talents proudly own! Then smile, and know thyself supremely great, And leave to little souls the pomp of little state! TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY ROBERT MERRY, Esq. Member of the Academè Della Crusca at Florence. Sweet is the calmly cheerful hour, When from mute midnight's ebon tow'r The moon escapes, and sportive hies O'er the gay garden of the skies; Where Nature's noblest flow'rs unfold Their starry buds of burning gold; The weary winds pant on the deep, Or 'mongst the cradling billows sleep; The streams their lucid lakes display; The forests shake their sighs away; Soft lustre ev'ry shade pursues, That darkly drinks the falling dews; While odour from her silken wings An aromatic ether flings. All is delight! but, ah! in vain These varying glories bless the plain; For see, the frenzied lover speeds From the bright groves and glitt'ring meads, From gaudy hills, enchanted bow'rs, And flowing waves and summer show'rs; And seeks the lovely pensive cave, Where he may groan, and weep, and rave; And wrap his thoughts in sablest gloom, And lure a transport from the tomb; Where he may hope to rest at last, When Passion's rending pangs are past. But e'en if then he chance to hear The warbling of the bird sincere, Who loves her secret pangs to throw In all the melodies of woe, His heart relents, his trembling lid, In pity's lucid veil is hid; Subjected agonies depart, And soft'ning sorrow soothes his heart. So I, dear Laura! long supprest The thorn of anguish in my breast; Lost to each social solace gay, And heedless of the blooms of May; And heedless of the haughty Sun, When, to his mad meridian run, He lifts his red refulgent shield, And fires the Heaven's eternal field. Yes, I from each allurement fled To where incumbent darkness spread; Trod the black torrent's gloomy side, And held fierce converse with the tide. Ah! then thy numbers seiz'd my soul, I found the thrilling sadness roll In sweet similitude of joy, That might my direst griefs destroy: They stole upon my tranced sense, As the fresh gales of morn dispense New life to ev'ry shrub that fades In Solitude's neglected shades. Transcendent Laura! now receive The tribute gratitude shall give; Due to thy verse, whose sainted glow Bade my lost soul renounce its woe: Then frown not on my daring lay That strives to paint the golden day; To tell the lustre of the rose, And thy resistless charms disclose; But think, when in the grave's cold sleep My wretched eyes shall cease to weep, And, troubled by the wint'ry breeze, This sad, this burning heart shall freeze, Then shall my ling'ring verse declare How much I priz'd the good and fair! What tenderness my soul conceiv'd, How deeply for thy suff'rings griev'd, While future Poets, future ages join, To pour in Laura's praise their melodies divine. TO MRS. ROBINSON. This Sonnet appeared in the Oracle, 15th of October, 1798. Signed “Il manti timido.” In dreary midnight's lonely hour, When wretched lovers only wake, Ten thousand tears fast dropping pour And bathe this bosom for thy sake. When morning's misty eye uncloses, And gives the world another day, For thee (more sweet than vernal roses) Ten thousand sighs are breath'd away. But he whose scalding tears are flowing, Whose aching breast heaves many a sigh, Whose soul with fondest love is glowing, Must hide his heart's first wish, and die! TO MRS. ROBINSON, ON HER VISITING BATH IN ILL HEALTH. BY JAMES BOADEN, Esq. Maria from the busy circle flies, To breathe the purer bliss of brighter skies, Forsakes the scenes of her expanding fame, To renovate the anguish of her frame; Mentally perfect, her enlighten'd mind, Superior to disease, springs unconfin'd; Ranges the regions of the Muse's reign, Exempt from our inheritance of pain; And, while keen pangs oppress her lovely face, Wings the pure Ether of poetic space; Floats in the fragrance of the rubied rose, And shuts its bosom up in rich repose! So may these lines possess the placid pow'r, To soothe thy suff'rings in some torturing hour. June, 1791. TO MRS. ROBINSON, BY THE LATE ROBERT OLIPHANT, Esq. Of Clare Hall, Cambridge. Admir'd and lovely as the Paphian maid, Bright beauty's model, love's bewitching form, Ah! gentle Laura, thus in smiles array'd, My flinty heart to tender hopes can warm. Unpitied must he grieve who loves thee so? Say, must he steal subdued from ev'ry eye? Ah! if condemn'd to bear this load of woe, Say but “despair,” and bid thy victim die. Some pity then will from thy lips depart, Some comfort visit him who loves but thee, Who feels thy beauty wind about his heart, And struggling pants for death to set him free; Yet if thy cruel heart refuse to save, I only ask one tear to glisten on my grave. LINES ADDRESSED TO MRS. ROBINSON. BY THE LATE JOHN HENDERSON, Esq. On reading a little Welsh Ballad written by Mrs. Robinson entitled “Lewin and Gynniethe.” Thou pride of a nation where Genius is bless'd, Where the muse smiles, by fancy and eloquence dress'd, Sweet minstrel, whose plaintive and elegant mind Is the temple of wit and of pity combin'd. Oh! ne'er let the pen sleep in silence whose lays Claim the young budding laurel, a nation's just praise; Exert thy soft skill, and from Phœbus receive That wealth which the God shall to excellence give. 1783. A STRANGER MINSTREL. BY S. T. COLERIDGE, Esq. Written a few weeks before her death. As late on Skiddaw's mount I lay supine, Midway th' ascent, in that repose divine, When the soul, centred in the heart's recess, Hath quaff'd its fill of Nature's loveliness, Yet still beside the fountain's marge will stay, And fain would thirst again, again to quaff; Then when the tear, slow trav'lling on its way, Fills up the wrinkles of a silent laugh, In that sweet mood of sad and humorous thought, A form within me rose, within me wrought With such strong magic, that I cried aloud, Thou ancient Skiddaw! by thy helm of cloud, And by thy many-colour'd chasms deep, And by their shadows, that for ever sleep, By yon small flaky mists that love to creep Along the edges of those spots of light, Those sunny islands on thy smooth green height, And, by yon Shepherds with their sheep, And dogs, and boys, a gladsome crowd, That rush e'en now with clamour loud Sudden from forth thy topmost cloud, And by this laugh, and by this tear, I would, old Skiddaw, she were here. A lady of sweet song is she, Her soft blue eye was made for thee! O! ancient Skiddaw, by this tear, I would, I would, that she were here! Then ancient Skiddaw, stern and proud, In sullen majesty replying, Thus spake from out his helm of cloud, (His voice was like an echo dying!) “She dwells belike in scenes more fair “And scorns a mount so bleak and bare.” I only sigh'd when this I heard, Such mournful thoughts within me stirr'd, That all my heart was faint and weak, So sorely was I troubled! No laughter wrinkled on my cheek, But, oh! the tears were doubled! But ancient Skiddaw, green and high, Heard, and understood my sigh; And now, in tones less stern and rude, As if he wished to end the feud, Spake he, the proud response renewing: (His voice was like a monarch wooing.) “Nay, but thou dost not know her might, “The pinions of her soul, how strong! “But many a stranger in my height “Hath sung to me her magic song, “Sending forth his ecstasy “In her divinest melody, “And hence I know, her soul is free, “She is, where'er she wills to be, “Unfetter'd by mortality! “Now, to ‘the haunted beach’ can fly, “Beside the threshold scourg'd with waves, “Now where the maniac wildly raves, “Pale Moon, thou spectre of the sky! “Now wind that hurries o'er my height “Can travel with so swift a flight. “I too, methinks, might merit “The presence of her spirit! “To me too might belong “The honour of her song and witching melody! “Which most resembles me. “Soft, various, and sublime, “Exempt from wrongs of time!” Thus spake the mighty mount! and I Made answer, with a deep drawn sigh, Thou ancient skiddaw! by this tear, I would, I would, that she were here! November, 1800. IMPROMPTU ON MRS. ROBINSON Being present at the performance of the Merchant of Venice at Covent Garden. BY THE LATE JOHN HENDERSON, Esq. Whilst Macklin Shakespeare's Shylock holds to view, See beauteous Robinson out-act the jew; One pound of flesh his malice could assuage, Her Christian charms severer bonds engage; When love-inspiring eyes their darts dispense, Who meets the glance must expiate th' offence; In vain applause would pay the debt in part, She claims the sacrifice of every heart. November 6th, 1780. J. H. TO MRS. ROBINSON. BY THE REVEREND B. BERESFORD. Full many a conflict hath my bosom prov'd, To chase thy image from its dwelling there; Full many a sorrow, many a tender care, For thy dear sake I've suffer'd, best belov'd; For, since thy beauties did my heart invade, Oft have I strove my liberty to gain; Oft, in soft solace to my am'rous pain, For balm, to heal the wounds which love has made, I court the muses; to assuage my grief Court sage philosophy; for vain relief, In quest of joy, I rove from fair to fair; Vain other charms, and vain philosophy! My vagrant heart must still return to thee, And one dear smile is worth an age of care! LINES ADDRESSED TO MRS. ROBINSON. Written by the Author of “Hartford Bridge,” &amp;c. &amp;c. in 1780. The Seaman, from winds and the fury of seas, Each harbour will bless where he anchors at ease; Yet with fonder regard will he eye the wish'd strand Where his vessel is destin'd and cargo must land. —So I, dear Maria, on life's ocean tost, When I cannot keep sea, veer about for the coast, And praise ev'ry harbour where shelter is found; But thou art the port where my wishes are bound. Those wishes accept, and abhorr'd may I be, If I e'er fram'd a wish that meant evil to thee! While, restless, from region to region I roam, My heart, still untravell'd, seeks thee for its home. Oh! yield it abode! and, believe me, my fair, Of this breast thou art tenant, none else harbours there; There, sweet star of beauty, thy dear image dwells, Wings the fond pulse of passion, the sigh ever swells, Gives a tide to the current that bathes the warm heart, Till, grown to the soul, it becomes e'en a part! Then yield it abode. Bow, ye monks, and be blest, The Heav'n I crave is a place in her breast; And say, breathes a monk who'd in secret reprove A devotion so true to the altar of love? Beshrew the cold being whom, rigid and fell, Nature forms a recluse and devotes to a cell! Let him melt o'er his relics, at beauty congeal, And saints praise his apathy, idiots his zeal: With love in my heart, and with thee in my eye, What zeal can divinity equal supply? TO THE MEMORY OF MRS. ROBINSON. BY DR. WOLCOT. Farewell to the nymph of my heart, Farewell to the cottage and vine, From thy scenes with a tear I depart, Where pleasure so often was mine. Remembrance shall dwell on thy smile, Shall dwell on thy lute and thy song, Which often my hours to beguile Have echo'd the valleys among. Once more the fair scene let me view, The cottage, the valley, and grove— Dear valleys, for ever adieu! Adieu to the daughter of love! POEMS, &amp;c. PETRARCH TO LAURA. Supposed to have been written during his retirement at Vaucluse, a short time before his death. Ye Sylvan haunts, ye close embow'ring shades, That hang your dark brows o'er the silent glades; Ye mountains, black'ning wide the thorny vale; Ye lucid lakes, that trembling meet the gale; Ye gloomy avenues of dumb despair, Ye last asylums of long-cherish'd care; Eternal solitudes! where Love retires To bathe his wounds, and quench his fatal fires; Where frantic, lost, forlorn, and sad, I go, A wand'ring pilgrim in a maze of woe; Oh! to your deepest caverns let me fly, Breathe a fond pray'r, and 'midst your horrors die. Ye sparry grots, ye once ador'd retreats, Ye tinkling rills, ye consecrated seats, Whose velvet sod, embroider'd o'er with flow'rs, On the charm'd sense celestial odour pours; Ye roseate banks o'erhung with waving trees, That moan responsive to the murm'ring breeze, How cold, how desolate your shade appears, A path of misery, thro' a vale of tears! Now pale Despair hangs brooding o'er your bow'rs, Absorbs your sweets, and withers all your flow'rs; Strips the thick foliage from your verdant shades, And spreads eternal darkness o'er your glades; No more for me your sunny banks shall pour In purple tides ripe Autumn's luscious store; No more for me your lustrous tints shall glow, Your forests wave, your silv'ry torrents flow; Yet 'midst your heav'n my wounded heart shall crave One narrow cell, my solace and my grave. Subdu'd, o'erwhelm'd, a withering shade I stray, Shrink from myself, and shudder at the day: No more fond Hope sustains my sickening soul, Resistless passion spurns her meek controul; Corroding anguish o'er each prospect low'rs, Bends my weak frame, my lusty youth devours; Clings to my breast where ev'ry fibre bleeds, And on its vital throne insatiate feeds. Where shall I fly? what path untrod explore, Where love can wound, and memory live no more; Where, Laura, shall I turn, what balsam find To soothe the throbbings of my fev'rish mind? What blest relief can life's dull round impart, What rapture vivify the hopeless heart? What pitying star its beamy stream dispense, To light my soul, and cheer my vagrant sense; To gild the gloom of desolating woes, And lead my wand'ring spirit to repose? When wild with passion, madd'ning with remorse, From Avignon's lov'd walls I bent my course; While, roll'd in crimson clouds, the orb of day O'er seas of æther shed his parting ray, As to his western goal he journey'd forth, Leaving pale twilight weeping o'er the earth, Oft did I pause, oft turn my longing eyes To the tall spire that pierc'd the evening skies; All was serene! save when the vespers' sound Struck on my pensive heart with knell profound; While Fancy bade my frantic mind explore Those scenes of holy joy I taste no more; Unsullied altars, consecrated shrines, Where curling incense round each taper twines; Where, thro' long aisles, seraphic Pæans ring, And meek-ey'd virgins choral anthems sing! Where, like a being of celestial mould, My Laura's beauteous form I dar'd behold! While at the shrine her orisons she pour'd Pure as the spirit of the saint ador'd! Oft as the cross her snowy fingers press'd, Her auburn tresses veil'd her tranquil breast! A shade transparent deck'd her brow divine, And bade her eyes with temper'd lustre shine! As low she bow'd before the throne of Grace, An Angel-softness harmoniz'd her face; A smile benign reveal'd her tranquil soul, While from her lips devotion's fervour stole; Each conscious triumph to her share was giv'n, Her form was beauty, and her mind was heav'n. Fix'd to the earth, with trembling zeal I gaz'd. Each passion madden'd, and each sense amaz'd! Involuntary sighs too soon confess'd The struggling tumults lab'ring in my breast; No thought sublime on my rapt feelings hung, No sacred eloquence unchain'd my tongue; All, all was Love! while thro' my burning brain Rush'd a fierce torrent of convulsive pain; From my dim eyes celestial radiance stole, While howling demons grasp'd my sinking soul, Guilt's writhing scorpions, twining round my heart, Enflam'd each wound and heighten'd every smart; In vain I sought Religion's calm domain, And at her footstool pour'd my hopeless pain; The priestess, frowning on my impious pray'r, Check'd the bold suit, and hurl'd me to despair. Ah, Laura! canst thou seal the dread decree That tears thy Petrarch from his God and thee! That gives his mental hopes, his fond desires To conscious anguish and consuming fires? Canst thou with unrelenting vengeance urge A trembling soul to fate's extremest verge; And, while subdu'd it supplicates relief, Dash the doom'd suff'rer to eternal grief? Why, soft enchantress, spread the fatal snare That lures thy struggling victim to despair? Why with meek smiles my wand'ring sense reclaim? Why feed with pitying looks my hopeless flame? Ah! rather come in awful lustre drest, Calm my touch'd sense, and lull the fiends to rest; Teach me each rebel passion to disown, Chill my hot pulse, and freeze my heart to stone: With contrite sighs devotion's flame illume; With holy tear-drops gem this mental gloom: Come in transcendent virtue's sacred form, Stem the fierce torrent, and appease the storm; Grasp the dire bolt suspended o'er my head, And on my quiv'ring heart-strings patience shed; Check with thy counsels ev'ry madd'ning flight, Direct me trembling to the paths of light; Bow my parch'd lip to kiss the chast'ning rod, And lead me, blushing, to the throne of God! Where'er I fly, where'er my frenzy roves, To pine-clad summits or low bending groves, Still on my shatter'd brain thy form appears, Steals to my heart, and glistens thro' my tears: Thy voice I hear in ev'ry whispering gale, Thy fragrant breath from Citron buds inhale; I mark the Rose in native sweetness drest, I snatch the blushing emblem to my breast; Thy burnish'd ringlets float across my sight, In the last glowing stream of orient light; And as the star of morn unfolds its fire, Stolen from the glances of its burning sire, Thy beaming eyes emit translucent rays, The lustrous heralds of thy soul's rich blaze! A matron's purity thy smiles impart, And Truth's mild splendours brighten in thy heart; Ah! wherefore, Petrarch, wherefore rashly dare The dang'rous magic of a form so fair? Why was to thee the fatal moment given Which bade an Angel draw thy soul from Heav'n? Yet ere thy pow'r supreme my soul confess'd, Ere fainting Virtue fled my burning breast; While in its veins one ling'ring spark remain'd, One heavenly spark by trembling hope sustain'd; Vaucluse, thy sylvan solitudes I chose To cure my passion, or conceal my woes; And oft beneath thy melancholy shade Reluctant, pensive, half-resolved I stray'd; And trembling, fault'ring, frequent sighs I pour'd Before the shrine of him but half adored; While as the sacred Virgin's form I view'd A brighter Idoli every sense subdu'd! While holy vows were lost in warm desires Love dropp'd a tear that quench'd religion's fires; Till thro' my eyes my heart's true fervour shone, And my fond soul, dear Saint, was all thy own! Now o'er some craggy peak when frowning night Grasps the last lingering tint of ruby light; When o'er the vast expanse I seek in vain The tawny vineyard and the yellow plain; Heedless I wander, while the tempest flies, Brave the cold winds, nor heed the threat'ning skies— Where from the wild romantic cliffs around The headlong waters fall with hollow sound; And stealing thro' the winding vale below, Unseen, thro' mid-day glooms incessant flow; While sullen echo's aëry tongue betrays Where round her seat each brawling channel strays; While the lone owl, her lurid haunts among, To the pale moon repeats her nightly song; While rocks acute my fev'rish limbs sustain, Chill'd by the freezing blast and drizzling rain; While the keen winds in gusts impetuous yell, O'er the bleak cliff, that guards the shadowy dell, When the loud thunder fills the troubled air, And Forests wither by the lightning's glare; Madd'ning I see thy glitt'ring phantom rise, Spring from the steep, and hover 'midst the skies. I rave, I shriek, from point to point I start, While hell's worst torments riot in my heart; I court the fiends my rending pangs to share, And prove the wildest torments of despair. When first to these calm shades I bent my way, Led by the light of intellectual ray, I mark'd repose her gentlest balm diffuse, To soothe the hapless Hermit of Vaucluse! Where, 'midst the foliage of my laurel bow'rs, The Muse had sprinkled never-fading flow'rs; Where mild philosophy unveil'd her shrine, Each care to solace, and each wish refine; Whole years my studious eye intent explor'd The treasur'd gems by hoary wisdom stor'd! Each truth sublime by ancient sages taught, Grac'd with the glossy charm of polish'd thought: And oft the sickly taper's feeble rays Shrunk from the splendours of the solar blaze, While o'er the classic page absorb'd I hung, Where Homer breath'd, or tuneful Virgil sung! When all was silence, all was peace, my breast No pang endur'd, no wayward thought confess'd! Swiftly thy beauty gleam'd across my sight, Dimm'd the bright flame of transitory light, Spurn'd each weak barrier trembling Reason gave, And plung'd me vanquish'd in affliction's wave. Yet, yet once more, my aching bosom sought A lenient pause from agonizing thought; I left these bow'rs o'er foreign realms to stray, Love lit his torch to guide my thorny way! Mournful I journey'd o'er Italia's lands, And moisten'd with my tears Sicilian sands; Where the proud Danube's rushing waters roll, I pour'd the madd'ning anguish of my soul. O'er Alpine hills in solitary woe, I wept and wander'd 'midst eternal snow. Oft did I mark the Rhone's impetuous stream By the wan lustre of the moon-light beam; And as the foamy current curl'd along, Heard the rocks echo with my frantic song! Where Rome's majestic ruins tott'ring stand The hourly victims of Time's mould'ring hand, Whole nights I've trod the tesselated stone, While scarce a glimm'ring star in pity shone; Then starting 'midst th' impenetrable gloom, Grasp'd the cold fragment of some Martyr's tomb. And tore the crawling ivy from its bed, To weave a pillow for my burning head: Then rais'd my eyes to God in fervent pray'r, To end my being and my sorrows there. For O! eternal martyrdom I prove, Heav'n's doom'd apostate—my fell tyrant, love! When Rome her proud applause exulting gave, And round my car her laurels stoop'd to wave! When borne triumphant o'er the sacred ground, By holy hands with flow'ry chaplets crown'd! While clanking cymbals echo'd through the sky, And rosy infants bade the censers fly! When nations throng'd thy poet's Fame to share, And shouts of rapture fill'd the perfum'd air! No flush'd delight from adulation caught, No selfish joy with false ambition fraught Could draw my prostrate soul from love and thee, Still at thy shrine I bent the trembling knee! For who but thee, transcendent Angel! taught The flame to live, which kindled every thought? For who, like thee, could heavenly themes inspire, Or touch the sensate mind with hallow'd fire, Mingling with mortal dust the spark divine, That bade my verse with deathless glories shine. In yon cool grot emboss'd with shells and flow'rs, Where the hot stream of noon-day light scarce pours; Where silence reigns, save when the shallow rill With gurgling sound steals o'er the mossy sill; While 'midst the shadows of the twilight gleam, I tun'd my Lyre—thy fatal charms my theme; O'er my chill'd form sleep's sable curtain hung, Veil'd my sad eyes, and chain'd my fault'ring tongue. Each sense absorb'd, yet my fond soul was free, Its thoughts, its faculties, all dwelt with thee; Celestial visions hover'd o'er my breast, And rose-lip'd Angels sooth'd my pangs to rest. Their silver harps hung pendent on the sky, Bound with unfading wreaths of emerald die, While the wing'd choristers inscrib'd thy name On Heaven's blue tablet with ethereal flame. In the bland portal of the rosy East Aurora sat in golden mantle drest; The silent air, in crystal fetters bound, Slept on the folded clouds that glisten'd round; When to my ravish'd sight thy form was shown, The guardian spirit of the sphery throne! A crown of orient rays thy brow compress'd, A zone of myrtle clasp'd thy snowy breast! The tear of pity trembled in thine eye Like a bright Planet in the evening sky! The blush of morning mantled o'er thy cheek, When thus thy voice seraphic seem'd to speak: “Freed from the goading chain of mortal care, I rove a bless'd inhabitant of air; Yet, in delicious ecstasy I wait, Till my lov'd Petrarch shall partake my fate: The soul, once purified, awaits on those Who toil amidst a wilderness of woes: It guards the partners of its mortal hours, When anguish threatens, or despair devours, Shields the frail bosom with a cherub's wing, And robs the tyrant, Death, of ev'ry sting. But see the ruddy dawn's advancing blaze Tears my fond shadow from thy eager gaze; Yet Oh! if e'er thy Laura's Virtue charm'd, Her smile enraptur'd, or her beauty warm'd, Let Hope sustain thy sick'ning soul to prove “That Heav'n has joy, beyond the joys of love.”— She smil'd and vanish'd, while my frantic mind “Awoke to all the griefs it left behind!” Now driv'n from each vain gleam of fond delight, My sun of glory saddens into night; My once proud laurels doom'd, alas! to fade On the pale forehead of a ling'ring shade. I count my midnight beads, and kneeling, rave, On the damp sod, my Pallet and my Grave. Toiling thro' tedious years unseen, unblest, Eternal thorns corroding in my breast; I fast, I pray, and yet no comfort find; Heaven on my lips, but love within my mind! For thee, Oh Laura! restless sorrow pours, Sighs that still burn, and tears that fall in show'rs; The morning breaks; my fev'rish heart still mourns, Till twilight, pensive hour, again returns; When night's thick curtain o'er the scene unfurl'd Throws rest and silence o'er the breathing world; I feel thee still, within my heated brain; I weep, I sigh, I supplicate in vain! Or, if by chance one pitying ray of rest Warms the sad inmate of my throbbing breast, 'Tis but a gleam of intellectual light That feebly glances o'er my mental sight, And, for a moment, dissipates the gloom, To point my weary footsteps to the tomb. AINSI VA LE MONDE. INSCRIBED TO A FRIEND. Written at the beginning of the French Revolution. O thou, to whom superior worth's allied, Thy Country's honour—and the Muses' pride; Whose pen gives polish to the varying line That blends instruction with the song divine; Whose fancy, glancing o'er the hostile plain, Plants a fond trophy o'er the mighty slain; Or to the daisied lawn directs its way, Blithe as the songstress of returning day; Who deign'd to rove where twinkling glow-worms lead The tiny legions o'er the glitt'ring mead; Whose liquid notes in sweet meand'rings flow, Mild as the murmurs of the Bird of Woe; Who gave to Sympathy its softest pow'r, The charm to wing Affliction's sable hour; Who in Italia's groves, with thrilling song, Call'd mute attention from the minstrel throng; Gave proud distinction to the Poet's name, And claim'd, by modest worth, the wreath of fame— Accept the Verse thy magic harp inspires, Nor scorn the Muse that kindles at its fires. O, justly gifted with the Sacred Lyre, Whose sounds can more than mortal thoughts inspire, Whether its strings heroic measures move, Or lyric numbers charm the soul to love; Whether thy fancy “pours the varying verse” In bow'rs of bliss, or o'er the plumed hearse; Whether of patriot zeal, or past'ral sports, The peace of hamlets, or the pride of courts: Still Nature glows in ev'ry classic line— Still Genius dictates—still the verse is thine. Too long the Muse, in ancient garb array'd, Has pin'd neglected in oblivion's shade; Driv'n from the sun-shine of poetic fame, Stripp'd of each charm, she scarcely boasts a name: Her voice no more can please the vapid throng; No more loud Pæans consecrate her song, Cold, faint, and sullen, to the grove she flies, A faded garland veils her radiant eyes: A with'ring laurel on her breast she wears, Fann'd by her sighs, and spangled with her tears: From her each fond associate early fled, She mourn'd a Milton lost, a Shakspere dead: Her eye beheld a Chatterton oppress'd, A famish'd Otway—ravish'd from her breast; Now in their place a flutt'ring form appears, Mocks her fall'n pow'r, and triumphs in her tears: A flippant, senseless, aëry thing, whose eye Glares wanton mirth, and low-soul'd ribaldry. While motley mumm'ry holds her tinsel reign, Shakspere might write, and Garrick act in vain: True Wit recedes, when blushing Reason views This spurious offspring of the banish'd Muse. The task be thine to check the daring hand That leads fantastic folly o'er the land; The task be thine with witching spells to bind The feath'ry shadows of the fickle mind; To strew with deathless flow'rs the dreary waste; To pluck the weeds of vitiated taste; To cheer with smiles the Muse's glorious toil, And plant perfection on her native soil: The Arts, that thro' dark centuries have pin'd, Toil'd without fame, in sordid chains confin'd, Burst into light with renovated fire, Bid Envy shrink, and Ignorance expire. No more prim Kneller's simp'ring beauties vie, Or Lely's genius droops with languid eye: No more prepost'rous figures pain the view, Aliens to Nature, yet to Fancy true, The wild chimeras of capricious thought, Deform'd in fashion, and with errors fraught: The Gothic phantoms sick'ning fade away, And native Genius rushes into day. Reynolds, 'twas thine with magic skill to trace The perfect semblance of exterior grace; Thy hand, by Nature guided, marks the line That stamps perfection on the form divine. 'Tis thine to tint the lip with rosy die, To paint the softness of the melting eye; With auburn curls luxuriantly display'd, The ivory shoulder's polish'd fall to shade; To deck the well-turn'd arm with matchless grace, To mark the dimpled smile on Beauty's face: The task is thine, with cunning hand to throw The veil transparent on the breast of snow: The Statesman's thought, the Infant's cherub mien, The Poet's fire, the Matron's eye serene, Alike with animated lustre shine Beneath thy polish'd pencil's touch divine. As Britain's Genius glories in thy Art, Adores thy virtues, and reveres thy heart, Nations unborn shall celebrate thy name, And waft thy memory on the wings of Fame. Oft when the mind, with sick'ning pangs oppress'd, Flies to the Muse, and courts the balm of rest, When Reason, sated with life's weary woes, Turns to itself—and finds a blest repose, A gen'rous pride that scorns each petty art, That feels no envy rankling in the heart, No mean deceit that wings its shaft at Fame, Or gives to pamper'd Vice a pompous Name; Then, calm reflection shuns the sordid crowd, The senseless chaos of the little proud, Then, indignation, stealing through the breast, Spurns the pert tribe in flimsy greatness drest; Who, to their native nothingness consign'd, Sink in contempt—nor leave a trace behind. Then Fancy paints, in visionary gloom, The sainted shadows of the laurel'd tomb, The Star of Virtue glist'ning on each breast, Divine insignia of the spirit blest! Then Milton smiles serene, a beauteous shade, In worth august—in lustrous fires array'd: Immortal Shakspere gleams across the sight, Rob'd in ethereal vest of radiant light. Wing'd Ages picture to the dazzled view Each mark'd perfection—of the sacred few, Pope, Dryden, Spenser, all that Fame shall raise, From Chaucer's gloom—till these enlighten'd days: Then emulation kindles fancy's fire, The glorious throng poetic flights inspire; Each sensate bosom feels the god-like flame, The cherish'd harbinger of future fame. Yet timid genius, oft in conscious ease, Steals from the world, content the few to please: Obscur'd in shades, the modest Muse retires, While sparkling vapours emulate her fires. The proud enthusiast shuns promiscuous praise, The Idiot's smile condemns the Poet's lays. Perfection wisely courts the lib'ral few, The voice of kindred genius must be true. But empty witlings sate the public eye With puny jest and low buffoonery, The buzzing hornets swarm about the great, The poor appendages of pamper'd state; The trifling, flutt'ring insects of a day Flit near the sun, and glitter in its ray; Whose subtle fires with charms magnetic burn, Where every abject fool may have his turn. Lull'd in the lap of indolence, they boast Who best can fawn—and who can flatter most; Who with obsequious smiles mislead the mind, And prove most mischievous, by seeming kind; Pour on the Ear soft adulation's sound, And give to infamy the fame they wound; While with a cunning arrogance they blend Sound without sense—and wit that stabs a friend; Slanders oblique—that check ambition's toil, The pois'nous weeds, that mark the barren soil. So the sweet blossoms of salubrious spring Thro' the lone wood their spicy odours fling; Shrink from the sun, and bow their beauteous heads To scatter incense o'er their native beds, While coarser flow'rs expand with gaudy ray, Brave the rude wind, and mock the burning day. Ah! gentle muse, from trivial follies turn, Where Patriot souls with god-like passions burn; So shall thy song to glorious themes aspire, Rapt in the wonders of the Poet's lyre. Thro' all the scenes of Nature's varying plan, Celestial Freedom warms the breast of man; Led by her daring hand, what power can bind The boundless efforts of the lab'ring mind. The god-like fervour, thrilling thro' the heart, Gives new creation to each vital part; Throbs rapture thro' each palpitating vein, Wings the wild thought, and warms the fertile brain. To her the noblest attributes of Heav'n, Ambition, valour, eloquence, are giv'n. She binds the soldier's brow with wreaths sublime, From her, expanding reason learns to climb. To her the sounds of melody belong, She wakes the raptures of the Poet's song; 'Tis god-like Freedom bids each passion live, That truth may boast, or patriot virtue give. From her, the Arts enlighten'd splendours own, She guides the peasant—She adorns the throne; To mild Philanthropy extends her hand, Gives Truth pre-eminence, and Worth command; Her eye directs the path that leads to Fame, Lights Valour's torch, and trims the glorious flame; She scatters joy o'er Nature's endless scope, Gives strength to Reason—ecstasy to Hope; Tempers each pang Humanity can feel, And binds presumptuous Power with nerves of steel; Strangles each tyrant Phantom in its birth, And knows no title—but superior worth. Enlighten'd Gallia! what were all your toys, Your dazzling splendours—your voluptuous joys? What were your glitt'ring villas—lofty tow'rs, Your perfum'd chambers, and your painted bow'rs? Did not insidious Art those gifts bestow, To cheat the prying eye—with tinsel show? Yes; luxury diffus'd her spells to bind The deep researches of the restless mind; To lull the active soul with witching wiles, To hide pale Slavery in a mask of smiles; The tow'ring wings of reason to restrain, And lead the victim in a flow'ry chain. When warlike Louis, arrogant and vain, Whom worth could never hold, or fear restrain, The soul's last refuge in repentance sought, The artful Maintenon absolv'd each fault; She who had led his worldly steps astray Now, “smooth'd his passage to the realms of day!” O, monstrous hypocrite!—who vainly strove By pious fraud to win a people's love; Whose coffers groan'd with reliques from the proud, The pompous offsprings of the venal croud, And yet—so sacred was the matron's fame, Nor truth, nor virtue, dar'd assail her name; None could approach but with obsequious breath, To speak was treason—and to murmur death. In meek and humble garb, she veil'd command, While helpless millions shrunk beneath her hand. And when Ambition's idle dream was o'er, And art could blind, and beauty charm no more; She, whose luxurious bosom spurn'd restraint, Who lived the slave of passion—died a saint! What were the feelings of the hapless throng, By threats insulted, and oppress'd with wrong? While grasping avarice, with skill profound, Spread her fell snares, and dealt destruction round; Each rising sun some new infringement saw, While pride was consequence—and pow'r was law; A people's suff'rings hop'd redress in vain, Subjection curb'd the tongue that dar'd complain. Imputed guilt each virtuous victim led Where all the fiends their direst mischiefs spread; Where, thro' long ages past, with watchful care, Thy tyrants, Gallia, nurs'd the witch despair. Where in her black bastile the harpy fed On the warm crimson drops her fangs had shed; Where recreant malice mock'd the suff'rer's sigh, While regal lightnings darted from her eye.— Where deep mysterious whispers murmur'd round, And death stalk'd sullen o'er the treach'rous ground. O Day—transcendent on the page of Fame! When from her Heav'n insulted Freedom came; Glancing o'er earth's wide space, her beaming eye Mark'd the dread scene of impious slavery; Warm'd by her breath, the vanquish'd, trembling race, Wake from the torpid slumber of disgrace; Rous'd by oppression, Man his birth-right claims, O'er the proud battlements red vengeance flames; Exulting thunders rend the turbid skies;— In sulph'rous clouds the gorgeous ruin lies!— The angel Pity now each cave explores, Braves the chill damps, and fells the pond'rous doors, Tears from the flinty walls the clanking chains, Where many a dreadful tale of woe remains, Where many a sad memorial marks the hour, That gave the rights of man to rav'nous pow'r, Now, snatch'd from death, the wond'ring wretch shall prove The rapturous energies of social love; Whose limbs each faculty denied—whose sight Had long resign'd all intercourse with light; Whose wasted form the humid earth receiv'd, Who, numb'd with anguish—scarcely felt he liv'd; Who, when the midnight bell assail'd his ears, From fev'rish slumbers woke—to shed new tears: While slow-consuming grief each sense enthrall'd, 'Till Hope expir'd, and Valour shrunk—appall'd: Where veil'd suspicion lurked in shrewd disguise, While eager vengeance op'd her thousand eyes; While the hir'd slave, the fiend of wrath, design'd To lash, with scorpion-scourges, human-kind— Dragg'd with ingenious pangs the tardy hour, To feed the rancour of insatiate Pow'r. Blest be the favour'd delegates of Heav'n, To whose illustrious souls the task was giv'n To wrench the bolts of tyranny—and dare The petrifying confines of despair; With Heav'n's own breeze to cheer the gasping breath, And spread broad sun-shine in the caves of death. What is the charm that bids mankind disdain The Tyrant's mandate, and th' Oppressor's chain; What bids exulting Liberty impart Ecstatic raptures to the Human Heart; Calls forth each hidden spark of glorious fire, Bids untaught minds to valiant feats aspire; What gives to Freedom its supreme delight? 'Tis Emulation, Instinct, Nature, right! When this revolving Orb's first course began, Heav'n stamp'd divine pre-eminence on man; To him it gave the intellectual mind, Persuasive Eloquence and Truth refin'd; Humanity to harmonize his sway, And calm Religion to direct his way; Courage to tempt Ambition's lofty flight, And conscience to illume his erring sight. Who shall the natural Rights of Man deride, When Freedom spreads her fost'ring banners wide? Who shall contemn the heav'n-taught zeal that throws The balm of comfort on a Nation's woes? That tears the veil from superstition's eye, Bids despots tremble, and oppression die? Wrests hidden treasure from the sordid hand, And flings profusion o'er a famish'd land?— Nor yet, to Gallia are her smiles confin'd, She opes her radiant gates to all mankind; Sure on the peopled earth there cannot be A foe to Liberty—that dares be free? Who that has tasted bliss will e'er deny The magic power of thrilling ecstasy? Who that has breath'd Health's vivifying breeze, Would tempt the dire contagion of Disease? Or, prodigal of joy, his birth-right give In shackled slavery—a wretch to live? Yet let Ambition hold a temp'rate sway, When Virtue rules—'tis Rapture to obey; Man can but reign his transitory hour, And love may bind—when fear has lost its pow'r. Proud may he be who nobly acts his part, Who boasts the empire of each subject's heart, Whose worth exulting millions shall approve, Whose richest treasure—is a Nation's Love. SIGHT. INSCRIBED TO JOHN TAYLOR, ESQ. OCULIST TO HIS MAJESTY. O thou! all wonderful, all glorious Pow'r! That through the soul diffusest light sublime, And bidst it see th' omnipotence of God! O sight! to man the vivifying lamp, That, darting through the intellectual maze, Giv'st to each rising thought the living ray! As the Promethean touch awoke that source Whose glory warms the Planetary world, So the supreme illum'd the visual orb, To mark his works, and wonder at his pow'r! Transcendent gift! but for thy light divine, Oh! what a chaos were the mind of man! Compos'd of atoms, exquisitely fine, Each moving in a dark obstructed sphere, Forlorn, and undelighted! for to him Whose eye ne'er drank the widely beaming ray, What are the wonders of the starry worlds; Creation's fair domain, its gems, its hues, And all its bright diversity of charms? What are his faculties, his passions, thoughts? He labours through a wilderness obscure, Each other sense awaken'd, wanting still That sense divine, which gives to each its charm; The earth, to him, a solitary speck, For ever mournful, and for ever drear! Oblivion horrible! to know no change; Nor light from darkness! nor the human form, The image of perfection infinite! To fashion various phantoms of the brain, By each amus'd, and yet by each deceiv'd! To roll the aching eye, alas! in vain, And still to find a melancholy blank Of years, and months, and days, and ling'ring hours, All dark alike, eternally obscure! To such a wretch! whose brightest sense of bliss Is but the shadow of a waking dream, The sleep of death, with all its startling fears, Must teem with prospects of Elysium! For what is sleep, but temporary death; Sealing up all the windows of the soul, And binding ev'ry thought in torpid chains? Yet, only for a time the spell controuls, And soothing visions gild the transient gloom; For every active faculty of mind Springs from the numbing apathy of sleep With renovated lustre and delight! But he who knows one unenlighten'd void, One dreary night, unbless'd with cheerful dreams, Lives in the midst of Death; and, when he sleeps, Feeds a perpetual solitude of woe, Without one ray to dissipate its gloom. Then what to him avails the varying year, The orient morn, or evening's purple shade, That robes Creation in a garb of rest? What all the beauties of the vast expanse, The tint cerulean, or the vaulted arch Of Heaven's eternal dome! Can Fancy paint, With all the vivid magic of her pow'r, The spangling legions of the sphery plains; The gaudy-vested Summer's saffron glow, When proudly gilded by its parent Sun, As through the flaming Heav'ns his dazzling car, Burnish'd with sparkling light, sheds liquid gold O'er seas ethereal; while the breezes stay To kiss the fainting flow'rs, whose silky heads, Inclining, fade beneath their with'ring touch? Can Fancy give the rainbow's lustre pure To the cold vacuum of the sightless eye? Insensible to colours, space, or form, Stumbling and fearful, through a desert shade, Man gropes forlorn, and lab'ring like the Mole; He feels the vivifying glow divine, But, 'midst the blaze of radiance infinite, An isolated being, wanders still, Sad, unillum'd, disconsolate, and lost! Nor yet alone the misery extreme Of the dread gloom opaque involves his mind; The longing for that something yet unknown, Whose pow'r he feels, diffusing its warm touch O'er ev'ry sensate nerve! that Power which marks The varying seasons in their varying forms, That tells him there is yet a sense untried, Ungratified, yet fraught with heavenly bliss, Distracts beyond the certitude of pain, Chills the expanding source of mental joy, And deadens all the faculties of man! Ah! woe too exquisite for human thought! Of mortal miseries, the dread supreme! How can the soul its energies sustain, When Reason's crystal gates are clos'd in night, And cold Oblivion hovers o'er the mind? What are the horrors of the dungeon's gloom, The bolts of steel, or the flint-fretted roof, The temporary spells that shut the wretch From the bland glories of effulgent day? While Hope comes smiling on the wings of Time, And the small crevice in his loathsome cell, That promises a glimm'ring stream of light, Bids him look forward to the coming joy! What are the self-created, anxious fears, That, thronging round the midnight traveller, Give to his straining eye fantastic forms, And fills imagination's boundless scope With shadowy hosts, scaring his startled mind; While Silence reigns despotic o'er the plain; Save where the bird of solitude salutes The melancholy hour, and pours alone Her love-bewailing song; yet hope beguiles, Nor quits him as he strays, 'till the wan moon, Peering in silvery panoply of light, Sails placidly sublime through the still air, And scatters round her imitative day! But the unvarying cloud of deepest night! The blank perpetual of the sightless orb! The mournful chaos of the darken'd brain! No hope can animate, no thought illume; All is eternal solitude profound; A dreadful shade, that mocks each other sense, And plunges Reason in its worst abyss! And yet, in such a mind, so whelm'd in gloom, The pure affections of the soul still live! The melancholy void is subject still To the sweet magic of seraphic sounds; The soothing eloquence of sacred song; The whisp'ring gale, that mourns declining day; Or Philomela's soul-subduing strain, That woos lone Echo, from her viewless seat, To sail aërial-thron'd upon the breeze! The lulling murmurs of the wand'ring stream; The ever rippling rill; the cataract fierce; The lowing herds; and the small drowsy tones That, from the insect myriads, hum around; The love-taught minstrelsy of plumed throats; The dulcet strains of gentle Consolation! But, most of all, to that lov'd voice, whose thrill, Rushing impetuous through each throbbing vein, Dilates the wond'ring mind, and frees its pow'rs From the cold chains of icy apathy To all the vast extremes of bliss and pain! For, to that voice ador'd, his quiv'ring pulse Responsive beats! he marks its ev'ry tone, And finds in each a sympathetic balm! Ill-fated wretch! he knows not the sweet sense That feeds upon the magic of a smile! That drinks the poison of the murd'rous eye, Or rushes, in an ecstasy of bliss, To snatch the living roses from the cheek! He knows not what it is to trace each charm That plays about the symmetry of form, And heightens ev'ry timid blushing grace, More lovely, from the wonder it commands! He never mark'd the soul-expressive tear! The undescribable and speaking glance, That promises unutterable bliss! Then what to him avails the ruby lip, Or the rich lustre of the silky waves, That half conceal the azure tinctur'd eye, As golden clouds rush on the morning star, And glow, exulting, o'er its milder ray! O glorious sight! sublimest gift of God! Expansive source of intellectual bliss! By thee we climb to immortality, Through all the rugged paths of tedious life! Thy nerve shoots forth a light ineffable, That marks the fount of science, and reveals The many-winding paths of wisdom's maze! Thou canst within thy narrow vortex grasp The outstretch'd ocean, and the landscape wide, Diversified with craggy cliffs, whose heads Hang fearfully sublime, half veil'd in clouds, O'er the low valley's solitary breast! 'Tis thine, upon the mountain's dizzy edge To ponder on the wonders of the sky! Or, bending o'er the margin, trace below The world of mingling atoms, less'ning still As the dread cavity grows more profound; Till woods, and lakes, and scatter'd villages, And stately palaces, and lofty spires, Fade in the deep impenetrable gloom! Thou canst avert the storm that gathers round, And bids thee seek the hospitable roof Where meek philanthropy unfolds her store! 'Tis thine to contemplate the gorgeous Sun In all its majesty of living light, Flaming, despotic, o'er unnumber'd worlds! 'Tis thine to mark the snowy-vested plains, That, like the glitt'ring stores of Avarice, Dazzle and chill the wretched wand'rer's soul! Or, midst the wreck of Nature, still secure, Gaze where the black'ning tempest, bursting round, Tears the young branches from the parent trunk, And strips the forest of its loftiest pride! And yet! so wonderfully form'd to meet The cutting blast, the winged lightning's glare, The painful radiance of the scorching Sun; To watch the midnight taper's glimm'ring flame O'er the long studious page, or pore intent Upon the fine-wrought mysteries that lurk In art mechanical! to trace the stars Through all their devious labyrinths of air; To plunge amidst the foamings of the deep; Or pour the copious torrents from that spring By pity cherished in the human breast! Yet—so alive is ev'ry wondrous part, In each complete, in all pre-eminent! So exquisitely delicate each nerve, So subject to destruction and to pain, That the minutest particle obscure, Almost invisible to that it meets, Obstructs its pow'rs, and o'er the visual ray Rolls a huge mass of agonizing shade! Such are the horrors, such the pangs acute, That shroud the darken'd eye, whose mortal sense, Consign'd to one unbless'd and mournful night, Can by eternal day alone be cur'd! Where the dim shade shall vanish from its beams, And, bathing in a sea of endless light, The renovated orb, awoke from death, Shall snatch its rays from immortality. SOLITUDE. Hail, Solitude serene! thou nurse of thought! To whom the weary mind retires, to taste The blissful hour of exquisite repose! Thou, who delight'st to dwell in shaggy woods, Whose variegated foliage hangs its shade O'er the rude margin of the mountain's brow; Or, interwoven, down its sloping side, Spreads the dim horrors of a mid-day night! Hail, pensive Solitude! whose footsteps stray Along the pebbly borders of the main, When from the eastern clouds the Sun darts forth, Lifting his glorious canopy of fire Above the pale horizon, spreading round A living world of undulating Light! Or seek the cool and unfrequented bow'r, The bushy dell, or the dew-spangled grot, When the fierce Lord of Noon, with flaming eye, Rolls furious o'er the sapphire floor of heav'n; Or downward shoots his shaft of glitt'ring fire, Upon the sultry heath and thirsty mead, To drink the ling'ring tears of Morn, that shine On the young violet's aromatic breast: Or, when, with humid hand, her purple robe Meek Twilight draws across the mountain's brow, Veiling its golden crest, in dusky shade Of cold, oblivious gloom, thou lov'st to sit, And watch the lamp of night, ethereal borne, Glide o'er the cavern'd cliff, whose torrents roar Down its stupendous sides, and foam to reach The desolated valley, lost below! Then, Solitude, 'tis thine in ev'ry gale To hear celestial breathings; from each hill To quaff the balmy essence of the breeze; To mark, in every magic change of scene, The grand diversity of Nature's laws, Yet find in all the ever present God! Whose pow'r, sublime, with equal wonder moves In the small flowret bursting from the earth, As in the sphere-crown'd eagle's tow'ring wing! Then wilt thou trace, with Fancy's tearful eye, The once delicious scene; the rural cot; The village house of pray'r; the sun-burnt hind; The lowly children of the rushy roof; The flocks; the herds; and all the golden pride Of glowing Autumn whelm'd beneath the flood. O sacred Solitude! amidst thy scenes Of rapture infinite, thy ills are these: The ruthless cataract; the midnight blast; The death-wing'd tempest; and the with'ring bolt Of Heav'n-avenging wrath! Nor art thou only Destin'd to endure, in solitary shades, The sad diversity of direful woe! The sweeping hurricane, the stormy hour, The fatal lightnings, and the whelming flood, Are but the emblems of disastrous life! Then let me court thee in thy gentlest form; In lonely grottos, and in verdant glens, Where the slow brook runs babbling from its source, And perfum'd zephyrs fan the fervid ray! Where Meditation, like an Hermit pure, With bosom taught by mild philanthropy, In silence mourns the miseries of Man! Creation's Lord! who, plac'd amidst the gems, The luxuries of Nature's vast domain, Still pants for more; and, still impatient, grasps The glittering vision of delusive joys; The gaudy phantoms of a transient day; The breath of popularity, that turns Inconstant as the wind; the flatt'rer's smile; The wreath of Fame, imbued with human gore; And, worst of all—O agonizing thought! The paltry boast of treasure, wrung, alas, From the torn bosom of the hapless slave, The wretched offspring of a fiercer Sun! For these, he wields the desolating sword; Quits the dear mansion of domestic peace; The lov'd companions of his native home; The social comforts, and the calm delights, That thronging round the blazing hearth, beguile The tardy winter's night: for these he dares The pois'nous vapours of infected climes, The torrid ray, or the pernicious blasts Of petrifying Lapland's cheerless skies! For these he wanders far, o'er unknown seas, To tame the tribes barbarian, or explore The sad variety of human woes. Oh! blind, misguided, and mistaken Man! To leave the garden of luxurious sweets, And wander 'midst a desert, fraught with thorns. Ah! let me, in some shelter'd valley, own A cottage, lowly, but secure from harm; From the rude rioter, or caitiff wretch, Who, prowling by the twinkling starry light, Assails the houseless traveller, and bares Against his beating breast the murd'rous knife. From such as these secure, let sweet repose Strew on my pillow rude the buds of Spring, The opening treasures of the infant year! There, let oblivious slumbers lull my mind, And harmonize the quickly throbbing pulse, That, through the creeping hour of day, endur'd The various thrills of ecstasy and woe. And you, ye airy phantoms of the brain, Ye forms fantastical, or fraught with fear, Oh! fly the blest abode of gentle peace; Nor with your agonizing spells assail The weary senses, wrapp'd in balmy sleep! And when the Lark, the harbinger of day, Sweeps the blue ether with exulting wing, And welcomes her approach with shrilly song, With thee I'll quaff the ever-winding rill, And feast upon the luxuries that rise From the warm bosom of the teeming earth! While Health, the blooming handmaid of Repose, Shall smile upon my board, and give a zest To the rich banquet of content and joy. There the faint wanderer shall be my guest, With modest mien, and converse undefil'd; Unvarnish'd emblems of the spotless soul! And there, the legendary tale shall claim The midnight hour serene; while the pale lamp Shall feebly gleam upon the frugal board: Yet, not to these confin'd; the loftier theme, The wing'd idea, and the soothing strain Of Heav'n-descended song, shall charm the soul, And give to ev'ry nerve a keener sense! There, shall the hoary sage, Philosophy, Unfold his sacred lore; while Wisdom's son Shall, smiling, smooth the rigid brow austere, And mingle in the scene of humbler bliss! Then, welcome Solitude! The sphere is thine, That gives the purest passions ample scope! That bids the soul beam with exterior grace Of light, reflected from the source within! And when its essence shall evaporate, Fann'd by the desolating wing of time; When this dull scene of transitory life, And all its sorrows, all its joys are o'er; One sparkling atom, from its prison clay, Shall soar, to mingle with its native Heav'n. THE PROGRESS OF MELANCHOLY, A FRAGMENT. O! Melancholy! parent of Despair, Whose pitying pow'r, whose poison fell Creeps thro' the sickening brain, the pallid cheek, The languid downcast eye, the listless frame, The desolating toil of ceaseless thought, Proclaim thy dark and fateful hour at hand! Absorb'd amidst surrounding revelry, Thy child, O! ruthless Melancholy! steals; Unheeding the loud laugh, the wanton jest, The sign mysterious, or the whisper low Of shrewd, sharp-sighted, prying observation. Nor magic charm, nor herb medicinal, Nor all the treasur'd lore of studious skill, Can draw thy victim from the numbing spell That fascinates and chains her yielding soul! Seldom she speaks: if question'd, she returns The answer incoherent and unapt, Mark'd by the frequent pause and vacant eye. Sometimes she weeps; but nature's niggard hand Denies the copious show'r, sweet balmy fount, That cools and vivifies the burning brain! And now she starts! and now-and-then, by fits, She looks aghast, trembles, and deeply sighs; Then sinks into the torpid dream again. She loathes the blooms of spring; the glowing hour Of feast and minstrelsy, and playful mirth! Her mind, each active faculty possess'd, Resigns itself to ever-musing woe: For her no orient beam adorns the sky: No balmy wing ethereal through the shade Flings the refreshing breeze; no limpid brook Sparkles with noon-tide rays, reflected back With ten-fold lustre from its glassy breast! The change of season, and the varying hour, Serve to make up the dull account of time, But bring no interval of gleaming joy! Or, if her sense can aught discriminate, She ponders on the miseries of life; The barren mountain, where the tott'ring hut Rocks as the whirlwind sweeps its rushy roof, And hurls it fathoms down the craggy steep! The chamber, where the paly quiv'ring lamp Shews the worn suff'rer on the bed of death! For her the woodland nightingale attunes His song nocturnal, unregarded—lost! The sad, the sympathetic, plaintive strain, O'er the dull ear of sorrow passes faint, If not unheeded; or, if feeling wakes, Recall'd by memory to long past woe, Reflection glances o'er the page of time, And marks its progress with a silent tear! Pale Melancholy shuns the rural haunt, Where peace, and joy, and revelry preside! Bliss-breathing Health, that welcomes young desire, Led on by smiling hope and blooming love, Starts from her with'ring form, and steals away; While apathy, with petrifying hand, Spreads a dim shadow o'er each faded charm. The twilight gloom amidst embow'ring woods She courts, and bending o'er some wizard stream That winds among the ever-mould'ring heaps, Strew'd by the touch of time from antique tow'rs And arches fretted with fantastic forms, She sits, the pensive genius of the scene! Around her cell attentive stillness reigns; The breezes sleep; and o'er its pebbly bed The shallow river bends its silent way; Death seems to triumph o'er the breathing world, Save where the bat from the dark ruin flits, Cleaving the night-mist with his dusky wing. Nor there alone presides the mournful maid; She loves to stray, and ponder as she strays, Along the dreary monumental pile; Where, from the Gothic roof, with ivy bound, The whistling wind descends, and through the aisle Sweeps the long hoarded dust for ages heap'd On the vain records of th' unconscious dead! Oft, when the wintry moon o'ertops the hills, In circling vapour wrapp'd, she wanders forth O'er the bleak heath; list'ning the rising gale, Or distant village bell, whose sound, once told, Proclaims the witching hour. Then Fancy comes; But in her train no lovely forms appear, No blithesome groups, thridding the roseate wreath, Or tripping in fantastic measures by; No Sylvan pipe, no rude, yet dulcet note Of mountain minstrelsy delights her ear; But the shrill menace of the freezing blast, (Thron'd on whose black and desolating wing Disease and death hurl the destructive shaft) Howls o'er her breast. Still dauntless, she proceeds; The drizzly dew, the sharp and nipping gale, Pass o'er her cheek unheeded. All alone She contemplates the solitary scene, While horror, madd'ning, conjures up an host Of spectres gaunt; of chiefs, whose mould'ring bones Have slept beneath the green-sod where they fell, Till village legends scarcely say—they died! Now from their prison-graves again they start, Hurling the airy jav'lin on the foe; And now they rush, in mighty legions, on; Now from the length'ning columns fiercely brave; And now the broken ranks disordered fly, Pale as the silvery beam that marks their course; And now the breathless heaps bestrew the plain, While on their mangled limbs the batter'd shield Gleams horrible; as through the indented steel The life-stream gushes from the recent wound! The groan of death fills up the dreadful pause; Sad, and more sad, it echoes o'er the scene, Till, oft repeated, the deep murmur dies! The cherish'd poison, now more potent grown, Riots o'er all the faculties at will; Strong in conceit, with fascination fraught, Painfully pleasing. As the fever burns The consciousness of misery recedes; Till, fill'd with horror, reason's barrier fails, And frenzy triumphs o'er the infected brain! Now the wan maniac hurries to the bourn Whose sandy base the frequent surges lave; Dishevell'd! wild! and fearless of the storm! There, o'er the dreadful summit she inclines, While darkness wraps the liquid world below: She listens, with attention mute, to catch The mournful murmurs of the distant main; The tempest wakes; the rous'd and angry waves Rise in the mighty elemental strife, Urg'd by the howling blast, whose forceful breath Repels them, foaming, to their native deep. Amidst the din terrific, the doom'd bark Strikes on the rocky shore. The wretched crew Fill the dread chorus with the groans of death, Till the tir'd winds moan o'er the shattered wreck, That sinks amidst the fathomless abyss! Rous'd from her dream, pale Melancholy starts; Shrieks louder than the blast! but shrieks unheard; Then plunges headlong from the dizzy steep, And, in the bosom of despair, expires! Now the faint dawn gleams o'er the eastern cliff; The smooth sea brightens with the coming ray, And not a vestige of the storm is seen! THE CAVERN OF WOE. As Reason, fairest daughter of the skies, Explor'd the vale, where mortal mis'ry lies; Led on by fortitude, with eye serene, She mark'd each object of the varying scene; In every maze of busy life she found Some hidden snare, some agonizing wound; For each her hand display'd a precious balm, Whose pow'r divine the tortur'd soul could calm; Till midway, on a rock of dreadful height, The Cave of cureless woe assail'd her wond'ring sight! On the bleak threshold, with'ring and forlorn, Heart-wounded Melancholy sat reclin'd! The rude blast scatter'd her dishevell'd hair; Round her cold brow the deadly nightshade twin'd! Near, on a craggy point, stood wild despair, Whose pangs supreme all lesser miseries scorn! And as the gaunt tormentor, smiling, view'd The pensive child of Sorrow, soul-subdu'd; With taunting mien, she beckon'd from below The fierce, relentless bands of desolating woe! First, swift as lightning up the flinty steep Impatience flew, barefooted, out of breath; Scorning the perils of the dreadful sweep; Heedless of wounding thorns, and threat'ning Death. Eager to rush the foremost of the train, She fear'd not danger, and she felt not pain: With longing eye she view'd the tow'ring height; From peak to peak, quick climbing with delight, She pass'd the fatal cave; then turning short, Fell headlong from the rock, of ev'ry fiend the sport! Then horror darted forth, in wild amaze! Her hair erect, with pois'nous hemlock bound; Her straining eye-balls flashing fires around, While nature trembled at her potent gaze! Swift to the dizzy precipice she flew, As, aiming with impetuous force to throw Her giant form amidst the gulph below! When, from an ivy'd nook obscure, pale fear Peep'd forth, slow whisp'ring to her startled ear, “Think not the pow'r of death thy mis'ries will subdue!” Then Horror bent her blood-shot eyes below, Where, by a group of demons compass'd round, Lay suicide accurs'd! from many a wound On his bare bosom did life's fountain flow! Now shame, with cheeks by burning blushes fir'd, And skulking Cowardice, in haste retir'd! While conscience plac'd beneath his fev'rish head A pillow dire, with thorns and nettles spread; And guilt, with all the scorpions of her train, Oped to his fainting eyes eternity of Pain! Then luxury approach'd on couch of down! Drawn by her offspring, folly and disease, Flush'd Pleasure decking her with roseate crown, And bow'd obedience, ever prone to please, Waiting her nod! languid she seemed, and pale, Restless, and sated with voluptuous fare; Beside her pillow, hung with trappings rare, Stood trembling palsy, ready to assail; And writhing agony, and slow decay, And hood-winked vice abhorr'd, that shunn'd the eye of day. Next, with a solemn, slow, and feeble pace, Came silent poverty, in tatter'd vest! The frequent tears, that glisten'd on her breast, Had fretted channels down her meagre face! A rabble crew of idiots dinn'd her ear: While mean reproach came smiling in the rear. With firm, yet modest look, she pass'd along; Nor sought relief, nor mark'd the taunting throng; While her wrung heart, still scorning to complain, Suppress'd the rending groan, and throbb'd with proud disdain. Close at her heels, insidious envy crept; The imp, deform'd and horrible in shape, Mock'd, when the slow-consuming victim wept, Pointing, and grinning, like a wither'd ape: About her throat, the asp detraction clung, Scatt'ring destructive poisons from her tongue! She wav'd a blasted laurel o'er her head, Stol'n from the sacred ashes of the dead; Inly she pin'd; while in her panting breast, Shrunk ignorance struck its fangs, to banish gentle rest. In a lone corner, almost hid in shade, With downcast eye, sat unrequited love! As from their hollow cell the slow tears stray'd, A willow garland for his brow he wove! Low at his feet, bare Madness laid his head, Rattling his chains, upon his flinty bed! Rous'd from his stupor by the clanking sound, The pensive youth gaz'd fearfully around; And wond'ring to behold such mis'ry near, Forgot his mournful wreath, and dropp'd a pitying tear. Now, lab'ring up the flinty winding road, Laden with treasure, bending to the ground, Appear'd lean avarice! the pond'rous load Seem'd his weak shoulders every step to wound: One thread-bare garb hung on his aged form; Scant covering from the bleak and wintry storm! Before him famine went, a thing decay'd; And dark suspicion, grasping at a shade! While fraud, low crawling, mock'd the reptile's art, Pilfer'd the scatter'd gold, and wrung the miser's heart! Next came deceit, with smooth and fawning tongue, Glozing with praises every thing debas'd; To shield her breast, a flattering mirror hung; A tinsel zone shone dazzling round her waist! Her hand, conceal'd beneath her flimsy vest, Clasp'd a keen dagger, ready to destroy; Content she seem'd, though, in her cunning breast, Her coward soul shrunk from the touch of joy; Her humble voice the list'ning ear beguil'd, While, with infernal art, she murder'd as she smil'd. Now through the cavern rush'd with iron hand Oppression insolent! his arm he rais'd, Waving his spear, with absolute command, While ev'ry subject fiend retir'd, amaz'd! At awful distance, trembling, prostrate round, The sons of pining slav'ry kiss'd the ground; Till, darting forward, o'er the abject crowd, With voice exulting, menacing, and loud, Insatiate vengeance snatch'd the up-rais'd lance, While bold oppression's arm fell nerveless at his glance. Next Pride came forward, gorgeously array'd; His brow a starry wreath of gems compress'd; In his right hand a sceptre he display'd; A robe of costly ermine wrapp'd his breast! Enthron'd, sublime, above the wond'ring race, Immortal beauties seem'd to deck his face! His eye assum'd pre-eminence of sway; He reign'd the gilded idol of the day; Till death, his dread supremacy to shew, Struck at the vaunting wretch, and laid his sceptre low. Now, rattling o'er the teeming plains afar, Came glitt'ring wealth, in his resplendent car! His rapid course swift-footed Toil pursu'd With sinewy limbs, and brown sun-freckled breast; The lord of luxury his vassal view'd, And, smiling, lifted high his haughty crest! But, when neglected toil at length retir'd, The short-liv'd glories of his brow expir'd; Around his eager eyes he roll'd in vain; Ingratitude appear'd, and claim'd her turn to reign! At her approach, the fatal cavern rung: Loud shouts of horror rent the vaulted stone! All lesser Fiends their heads in sorrow hung; Omnipotent in ill, she grasp'd the infernal throne! Then reason mark'd her blest associate fly; And shudd'ring at the scene, re-sought her native sky! MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE, Written immediately after her execution. When, the dread scene of death and horror o'er, Reason's calm eye time's tablet shall explore; When the dark demons of destructive ire No more shall see devoted hosts expire; When, o'er the desolated clime, the wise Shall bid, too late, the sacred olive rise!— Then justice shall the dreary spot illume Where pity lingers on the martyr's tomb; And, scatt'ring Sorrow's incense, sighing, say— “Thy fame, illustrious soul! shall ne'er decay!” Oh! then, when wand'ring on some distant shore, Musing o'er scenes of bliss he tastes no more! The holy exile shall, with up-rais'd eyes, Implore, for thee, the raptures of the skies! Though sad, forlorn, a stranger to repose, Celestial Faith shall mitigate his woes! And patience, smiling from her sphery throne, Shall bid his throbbing heart some solace own! Yet, as the pious sufferer bends his way, Cheer'd by the prospects of eternal day, Oft shall he pour his orisons divine, Forget his pangs, and only weep for thine! The pilgrim who, with tearful eye, shall view The moon's wan lustre on the midnight dew, As through the lonesome labyrinth he strays, Sooth'd by her lamp, and guided by its rays, Shall offer up to heaven an humble pray'r, (For contrite sighs are ever welcome there!) That, in seraphic realms, thy soul may know That bliss, inhuman rage denied below! Ah! who can trace, nor feel a pang severe, The dawn of joy that usher'd thy career! When, round thy youthful form, divinely gay, Ecstatic rapture wing'd the hours away? When, from the perfum'd couch of soft repose, More lustrous than the Morn, thy beauty rose! When all was pleasure, adoration, ease; For pow'r was temper'd by the wish to please; Where all around thee charm'd the dazzled view, For ever splendid, yet for ever new; Adorn'd with gems to Gallia's sons unknown, Domestic Virtues, glitt'ring round the throne! Who can reflect, nor drop the tenderest tear On the dread progress of thy fate severe! Hurl'd from the loftiest height of human bliss, To the worst horrors of Despair's abyss! To bear th' insulting cruelty of those Who, from thy subjects, to thy tyrants rose! Tore thy pale darlings from thy panting breast, And made maternal woes the rabble's jest; The bonds of wedded virtue rent in twain, And Truth's white bosom stampt with falsehood's stain! Denied the decent aid of female hands! No kind domestics wait thy meek commands! On a straw pallet, in a dungeon laid— By all suspected, and by all betray'd! Yet, midst the tortures of the direful plan, Which thrills with horror through the breast of man, Not all the rage of Hell's abhorr'd decree Could force one supplicating tear from thee! As the rich flow'ret on the mountain's side Unfolds its charms, and blooms with harmless pride! Rais'd 'midst the clouds, to combat ev'ry blast; Too high for shelter, and too fair to last! Awhile, contending wïth the varying spheres; Now blushing beauties! now adorn'd with tears! Still braves the mid-day sun, the chilling night, Sweet to the sense! and lovely to the sight; Nor heeds the torrent, rising o'er its bound; Or the dark skies, in tempests gath'ring round; Till from the flinty steep the waters flow, Pouring destruction o'er the vale below; And sweeping, with their desolating pow'rs, The tow'ring cedars and o'erhanging bow'rs! From rock to rock the frothy columns bound, Deaf'ning calm Nature with the fateful sound; Till, by no barrier in its course confin'd, It whelms the plain, and leaves no trace behind! No waving forest to adorn the scene; No hut to tell what once the spot had been; No sweet diversity enchants the eye; One liquid space reflects the low'ring sky! While on its troubled surface, spreading wide, Float the torn fragments of the mountain's pride! Till all, celestial bounty gave, defac'd, One dreadful Chaos triumphs o'er the waste!— Such is thy lot, O Gallia! such the rage That blurs, with crimson spots, fair Nature's page! That leaps the bounds of Reason, and destroys The law's strong barrier, and the subject's joys! That roots up all the sacred rights of Truth! The claims of Age, the energies of Youth! Bids Commerce tremble, Justice hide her scale, Contention revel, and Revenge prevail! Religion perish in the guilty mind, And Devastation riot unconfin'd! While all are rulers—all, alas! are slaves! Each dreads his fellow, each his fellow braves! While in one horrid mass all miseries blend; Each shuns his brother, and each fears his friend! The Son, with blood-stain'd faulchion, strikes the Sire! The Parent smiles, to see the son expire! Against his Lord, the Vassal wields his spear! The vaunting Atheist mocks the Vestal's tear! The lawless Idiot lifts his ruthless arm, To tear from Science every graceful charm! While Genius from the madd'ning tumult flies, Weeps o'er her with'ring bays, and seeks the skies! Far o'er the Globe, from all his kindred driv'n, Behold the sacred Minister of Heav'n! The pious pastor, wand'ring o'er the earth, Of mind enlighten'd, and of noblest birth! With whose proud race the proudest virtues came, To prove their rank their secondary claim; Who, 'midst the duties of religious life, Shrunk from the clamours of domestic strife. What is his lot?—To weep in some lone bow'r, And count new sorrows with each passing hour; To view the radiant morn, with aching eyes, O'er the far distant promontory rise; Diffusing bliss o'er Nature's children gay, Who laugh and labour through the peaceful day! Who fear no ruthless hand to check their joy, No mandate dire, existence to destroy! Who, blest with conscious innocence, can smile, Unstain'd with blood, and unreproach'd with guile; All the long day the task of toil endure, Contented, simple, peaceful, and secure! To see the infants, like fair branches, rise, The cherish'd offspring of serenest skies; While the rough Parent, like the Oak, shall last, To nurse their tender beauties 'midst the blast; Till, nourish'd to perfection, they aspire To match the sturdy virtues of their Sire! Turn to the beauteous Martyr! Austria's pride! Epitome of all—to worth allied! Mark, in her alter'd and distracted mien, The fatal ensigns of the pangs within! See those fair tresses on her shoulders flow In silv'ry waves, that mock the Alpine snow! Where are their waving braids of glossy gold, That crowned her brow, in many a silky fold? That brow, so withered by Affliction's blast! So stampt with age, before her prime was past! Where are the graces of that 'witching form? Torn from their home, and scatter'd to the storm! Those eyes! like sapphire gems were wont to shine; Bright beaming samples of their native mine! What are they now? clos'd in the sleep of death! Their blaze extinguish'd by Rebellion's breath! Yet, as the tempest threaten'd their abode, A stream celestial from their radiance flow'd! Like setting stars, they left their humid spheres, And their last fainting lustre gleam'd through tears! Oh! I have seen her, like a sun, sublime! Diffusing glory on the wings of Time! And, as revolving seasons own his flight, Marking each brilliant minute with delight! Yet not to pleasure only was she prone; She made the mis'ries of the poor her own! No ostentation lessen'd pity's meed— Unseen she gave! and silence seal'd the deed! She sought no plaudits from obsequious pride! She paid herself—for nature was her guide! For conscious rapture, to the tott'ring shed Oft would she fly, to bless the mourner's bed; There, bending o'er the aged widow's form, With smiles celestial, chase the wintry storm; Heal the stung bosom with compassion's tear! Pour balmy counsel in the startled ear! Fan, with her sighs, the fever of the brain; And, by partaking, lessen ev'ry pain! Shunn'd be the Fiend, who, in these dreadful times Would brand her mem'ry with infernal crimes; Shunn'd be the monster, who, with recreant art, Beyond the grave, would hurl Detraction's dart! With sacrilegious hands, relentless tear The blood-steep'd laurel, newly planted there! For, though insulted, massacred, defam'd, The Laurel, still, her peerless virtues claim'd! While, round the rugged sod, dread silence reigns, The cherub, Truth, obliterates its stains. Then let the Muse her weary sorrows trace, And Candour blot the records of Disgrace! Nurs'd in the cradle of Imperial State, Her infant dreams proclaim'd a milder fate! Enchanting visions sooth'd her op'ning mind; Though young, enlighten'd; and though gay, refin'd! Succeeding years roll'd on; and, as she grew, Each fleeting hour presented raptures new! Fresh as the breeze that fans the breast of May, She scatter'd perfumes on the face of day! Pride of her royal line, in youth's soft grace, She bloom'd, the loveliest blossom of her race! Transplanted from the bow'r of sweet repose, With Gallia's Lilies blending Austria's Rose; Form'd to adorn a cottage or a throne; For all that sooth'd the senses was her own! A stranger, from her native land, she came; Her dowry Beauty, and her passport Fame! Too young to play the subtle courtier's part, She charm'd all eyes, and gladden'd ev'ry heart! Too innocent, deceptive wiles to plan! (Her pow'r acknowledg'd, ere her reign began,) So exquisitely fair, so mildly gay, She made the wisest converts to her sway! To rule, she sought not; for obedience hung On the soft accents of her tuneful tongue. Her smile could guide the stubborn heart, or move The soul of Apathy to thrills of Love! Each playful action spoke the fire of youth; Her blush was innocence! her voice was truth! She trod the flow'ry paths of bliss supreme; Delight her guide, and gratitude her theme! Till, 'midst its sweets, the serpent, Envy, grew, Hating her charms, and sick'ning at their view! Pre-eminent she shone!—Each lesser light Shrunk from her radiance, in the glooms of night: Yet, like malignant stars, with potent pow'r, Flam'd the fierce demons of the vengeful hour; And scatter'd 'midst the storm their borrow'd rays, To prove the Sun was set that bid them blaze! First, low complaining murmurs echo'd round, While pleas'd Contention caught the sullen sound; Then while the mischief conjur'd up despair, Each thought his wrongs too infinite to bear: Too rash to follow Reason's sober plan, They marr'd the triumph they had scarce began! Now, mark the howling tempest far and wide! Mark, on the winds infuriate spirits ride! O'er the proud fabric and the painted dome, Long-threat'ning shadows spread impervious gloom; Death stalks, unmask'd, beside the scepter'd hand, While round the regal chair dark demons stand; With cries of murder, now the Palace shakes, And all is ruin, ere reflection wakes; Where the rich banquet met the dazzled eye, A thousand sheathless poniards glitt'ring lie; While the loud cannons roar destruction round, Triumphant Mischief smiles at ev'ry sound; And Malice pilfers all the sweets of rest, And plants the thorn of woe in beauty's breast. For crimes long past, when erst Oppression's hand Drove weeping Freedom from the Gallic land; When Truth fled, trembling, and subdu'd with fears; And godlike Virtue only shone in tears; For woes long past, insatiate Ire decreed, The just should fall; the guiltless heart should bleed! That heart which shudder'd at recorded crimes Stampt on the tablet of disastrous times! Which shrunk, aghast, at ev'ry dreadful view That shew'd past centuries, black'ning as they flew! When recreant satellites exulting shone, Their light a meteor, and their sphere the throne! Was it for those the last illustrious race Wash'd, with their blood, the page of dire disgrace! Was it for those an alien's heart was torn With taunting Insult's agonizing thorn! While low she bow'd, in with'ring graces drest, Truth in her eye, and Valour in her breast! Was it for those ill-fated Louis fell, 'Midst the vile clamours of the rabble's yell? Forc'd from his shrieking infants! and deni'd A parent's comfort, and a parent's pride! Dragg'd to the fatal agonizing goal; His only crime—the meekness of his soul! For, ah! while mem'ry ponders o'er the page That marks the regal line from age to age, Distracted Gallia! thou shalt never see So rare a Scion from so frail a tree! Mark the last scene of his disastrous state, When patient Virtue brav'd the lance of Fate! When, on the scaffold, crimson'd o'er with blood, The Monarch! Husband! Parent! Martyr! stood Amidst his subjects, now his foes severe; No pitying friend his parting sigh to hear! E'en then, high tow'ring o'er all human woes, Above himself the smiling victim rose! And, braving human sorrow's vengeful rod, Breath'd his last pray'r, and gave his soul to God! Thus the proud eagle, whose strong pinions soar, With dauntless eye day's sov'reign to explore, Sees all around transcendent glory blaze; The world beneath, an atom to his gaze! Yet through the airy regions grandly flies, And drinks the viewless nectar of the skies: In the bland space he wields his lordly flight, And riots in the plenitude of light! Till thick'ning vapours choke the fost'ring stream, Veil the faint stars, and shroud the orient beam! Swift to the world beneath his pinions sail, Where the tall cliff hangs low'ring o'er the vale; Where, rock'd upon the forest's waving crest, He left his offspring in their mother's breast. There, too, he finds the ruthless tempest's pow'r, The blue-wing'd lightning, and the whelming show'r! There, the shrill blast the rifted Pine lays low, While down the rocks the mingling cataracts flow; His darling mate, his little unfledg'd brood, Dash'd on the foamy bosom of the flood! Loud thunders mock th' aërial Sov'reign's cries, Till, 'midst the dreadful din, he soars, and dies! Now, ere the Muse her mournful task resigns, And the last Cypress garland fondly twines; Ere the faint emblems of her grief sincere Shall fade beneath Reflection's frequent tear;— She turns, with curious eye, the woes to trace, Heap'd on the breathing Suff'rers of thy race; Who, daily pining in a dungeon's gloom, Anticipate the silence of the tomb! Who, all the live-long day, unseen, alone, Pour the deep cadence of the tort'ring groan; Start, if the winds along their prison creep; Slumber, to dream of death, and wake to weep! Who, each new dawn, behold a glimm'ring ray Shed through their drear abode a doubtful day; And when the evening sun, with purpling light, Proclaims the coming shade of fearful night, Behold, with Fancy's all-creating eyes, The bleeding spectres of their kindred rise! Mark, from each bosom gash'd, a crimson tide, Life's tepid fountain from its channels glide! The widow'd Mother casts a wistful gaze On the sweet darlings of her splendid days; On her pale cheek the frozen tear still dwells, Like April dew upon the snow-drop's bells! Her quiv'ring lips, in murmurs, seem to say, “I come, my cherubs, from the realms of day! “Thy father triumphs in the spheres of rest, “And shares the endless transports of the blest! “There, far remov'd from Fate's disastrous frown, “He lives, possess'd of an immortal crown!” Then, as the feeble infants wond'ring stand, The fleeting spectre waves its snowy hand! The moaning wind through ev'ry crevice blows; Down the damp wall the midnight vapour flows: On their cold flinty couch, with tearful eye, Clasp'd in each other's arms, the mourners lie; They tremble, whisper, sigh, yet fear to weep, Till nature, faint with anguish, sinks in sleep! See, in a neighb'ring cell, a with'ring form Lists the fierce howlings of the midnight storm; Till, through her prison lattice, she descries The op'ning radiance of the morning skies! Upon the iron window's triple grate The chirping red-breast hails his freezing mate; Spreads his weak wing to meet the sun's faint ray, And sweetly twitters forth his matin lay: While the fair victim of supreme despair Beholds the free-born commoners of air; Envies their happy lot, and feebly cries, Ye little harmless trav'llers of the skies, Why quit your leafy bow'rs, your verdant plains, And wing your flight to Mis'ry's dread domains? Why, from the breezy hill's enamell'd side, To these sad tow'rs your whirring pinions guide? Hence, ye poor minstrels! hence, nor listen here! Where pining sorrow drinks her frequent tear; Where vengeance bares her never-weary fang, And smiles, insulting, on the suff'rer's pang; Where each corroding torment mocks relief, And Death, Death only, ends the reign of Grief! Is there, in all the legends of past times, An æra blacken'd with such wanton crimes? Such barb'rous mischiefs! sweeping from the earth Religion, talents, innocence, and worth! The wise, the good, the brave—all feel its force! Uncheck'd by reason, torpid to remorse. All smear'd with gore, pale Liberty appears, Her smiles contending with repentant tears; No more her hand fair flow'rets scatters round; Her faulchion steams from many a recent wound: O'er shatter'd pyramids she madd'ning flies, Pow'r in her arm, and murder in her eyes; Scar'd by the clamours of the furious rage, She spares not worth nor genius, sex nor age! All records perish by her rash decree! The wreaths of Valour, pride of Chivalry; The Sculptor's art, the boast of many a clime, (Snatch'd from the desolating grasp of Time); The Painter's glowing canvass, which displays The finish'd study of laborious days— Heap'd in one sacrilegious ruin lie, Feeding the flame that menaces the sky! While Ignorance points the victims of its ire, And loads with off'rings the insatiate fire! Deep dying murmurs float upon the gale, And ev'ry zephyr bears some woe-fraught tale! Here, Widows pine, not daring to complain! There, Orphans languish for a Parent slain! The mountain Peasant quits his lone retreat, His clay-built cottage and his vineyard neat! No more, at eve's approach, his Infants run, While the vale reddens with the sinking sun, To greet their weary Sire, whose labours hard Meet, in their dear embrace, their sweet reward! No more, when Winter desolates the grove, He listens to the voice of wedded love; Trims the clay hearth, and, as the faggots blaze, Chants the old ditty of his grandsire's days; While his fond mate the homely meal prepares, Smiles on his board and dissipates his cares! No more, amidst the simple village throng, He joins the sportive dance, the merry song! Now, torn from those, he quits his native wood, Braves the dread front of war, and pants for blood! Now, to his reap-hook and his pastoral reed, The crimson'd pike and glitt'ring sword succeed! His russet garb, now chang'd for trappings vain; His rushy pillow, for the tented plain! No more his matin song's melodious note Along the mountain's breezy side shall float! No more his board, with luscious fruits supply'd, Shall mock the banquet of luxurious pride! No more sweet slumbers bless his midnight hours! No more Hope strews his daily path with flow'rs! From his lorn breast all earthly comforts fly; He hates to live—yet more, he fears to die! Now, when the tardy day begins to rise, And short-liv'd slumbers quit his fev'rish eyes, Fancy, with agonizing pow'r, displays The peaceful comforts of his happier days! Shows, on the pallet of his former rest, His infants moaning on their mother's breast! Pinch'd by pale Famine, sinking to the grave; No food to nourish, and no friend to save! Ah! then he cries, half madd'ning with despair, “Is this the freedom I was call'd to share? “Where is my clay-built hut? where, wont to reign “The little monarch of Love's free domain, “My smiling partner clasp'd me to her breast, “My infants bless'd me, ere I sunk to rest!” Turn to the Nobles! there let Pity view The many suff'ring for the guilty few! Perish the wretch who, sanction'd by his birth, Presumes to persecute the child of worth! Perish the wretch who tarnishes descent By the vile vaunting of a life ill spent! Who sullies proud propinquity of blood, Yet frowns indignant on the low-born Good! Who shields his recreant bosom with a name; And, first in Infamy, is last in Fame! Yet let Reflection's eye discriminate The difference 'twixt the mighty and the great! Virtue is still illustrious, still sublime, In ev'ry station, and in ev'ry clime! Truth can derive no eminence from birth, Rich in the proud supremacy of worth; Its blest dominion vast and unconfin'd, Its crown eternal, and its throne the mind! Then Heav'n forbid that prejudice should scan With jaundic'd eye the dignities of man! That Persecution's agonizing rod Should boldly smite the “noblest work of God!” That Rank should be a crime, and Genius hurl'd A mournful wand'rer on the pitying world! Yet Heav'n forbid that Ignorance should rise On the dread basis where Religion dies! That Liberty, immortal as the spheres, Should steep her Laurel in a nation's tears! Oh, falsely nam'd! Does Liberty require The Child should perish for the guilty Sire? Does Liberty inspire the Atheist's breast To mock his God, and make his laws a jest? Does Liberty with barbarous fetters bind Her first-born hope, the freedom of the mind? Hence, bold Usurper of that heav'n-taught pow'r, Which wings with ecstacy man's transient hour! Which bids the eye of Reason cloudless shine, And gives Mortality a charm divine! 'Midst the wild winds, the lordly cedar tow'rs; Progressive days invigorate its pow'rs; The earlier branches, with'ring as they spread, Round the firm root their coarsest foliage shed; While the proud Tree its verdant head rears high, Waves to the blast, and seems to pierce the sky; Till the rich trunk, matur'd by length'ning years, Through all their wondrous changes, braves the spheres; Flings its rich fragrance on the gales that sweep The humid forehead of the mountain's steep; Mocks the fierce rage of elemental war, The bolt's red sulphur, and the thunder's jar; And, when around the shatter'd fragments lie, The stricken victims of th' infuriate sky— Amidst the wrecks of Nature seems to climb Supremely grand, and awfully sublime! So Heav'n-taught Reason, whisp'ring to the sense, In Nature's pure persuasive eloquence, Points out, amidst Creation's mazy plan, The vast, the varying miseries of Man: Then, as Experience comes with piercing eye, From his stern gaze delusive visions fly; Then radiant Knowledge rushes to his view, Spurns the deceptive, and adopts the true; Tears Folly's tinsel trappings from his breast, Which shines in Truth's invulnerable vest; Thus arm'd against the shafts of life he goes, Smiles at their menace, and resists their woes; While on his mind, in conscious Virtue great, The shield of Reason blunts the lance of Fate! Immortal Genius! let the votive line, The Muse's laurel, and her fame, be thine! For thou shalt live when Pride's indignant eye Clos'd in eternal solitude shall lie! When those who flutter'd through their little day, Shall, like their follies and their names, decay; When the faint mem'ry of inferior souls Down the dark channel of Oblivion rolls— Thou shalt survive! Then let not Envy's frown Blast the proud trophies that compose thy crown! Let not the poison of a reptile's sting Contaminate the lustre of thy wing! But from each flaming plume indulgent give A pitying ray, to bid the insects live. Trace, if thou canst, one straggling spark of worth, One gleaming atom to adorn their birth; For little virtues dazzle in the proud, As stars shine lustrous 'midst a vast of cloud! Then, Genius, let the toilsome task be thine, To labour in the dark precarious mine; And if, amidst the chaos, thou shouldst find One great, one beauteous attribute of mind, To twine round Merit's brow the wreath of Fame, And give Nobility a loftier name! Ill-fated Queen! then let the tribute just, The Poet's numbers consecrate thy bust: And when new ages shall the tale unfold, On the red page of Massacre enroll'd, Philanthropy, with shudd'ring heart, shall trace The storms that bow'd the lilies of thy race! Yet, 'midst the desolating gloom descry Transcendent chaplets that shall never die! The wonders of thy mind shall Hist'ry own; The brightest gems that glisten'd round thy throne; Which gave thee charms beyond the glare of pow'r, To brave thy foes, and gild thy latest hour! And when thy weary soul, on wings sublime, Sought its dear partner in a purer clime, Thy sufferings left on Truth's recording page An awful lesson for each future age! ODES. ODE TO THE MUSE. O, let me seize thy pen sublime That paints, in melting dulcet rhyme, The glowing pow'r, the magic art, Th' ecstatic raptures of the Heart; Soft Beauty's timid smile serene, The dimples of Love's sportive mien; The sweet descriptive tale to trace; To picture Nature's winning grace; To steal the tear from Pity's eye; To catch the sympathetic sigh; O teach me, with swift lightning's force To watch wild passion's varying course; To mark th' enthusiast's vivid fire, Or calmly touch thy golden lyre, While gentle Reason mildly sings Responsive to the trembling strings. Sweet Nymph, enchanting Poetry! I dedicate my mind to Thee. Oh! from thy bright Parnassian bow'rs Descend, to bless my sombre hours; Bend to the earth thy eagle-wing, And on its glowing plumage bring Blithe Fancy, from whose burning eye The young ideas sparkling fly: O come, and let us fondly stray Where rosy Health shall lead the way, And soft Favonius lightly spread A perfum'd carpet as we tread; Ah! let us from the world remove, The calm forgetfulness to prove, Which at the still of evening's close Lulls the tir'd peasant to repose; Repose, whose balmy joys o'er-pay The sultry labours of the day. And when the blue-ey'd dawn appears, Just peeping thro' her veil of tears; Or blushing opes her silver gate, And on its threshold stands elate, And flings her rosy mantle far O'er every loit'ring dewy star; And calls the wanton breezes forth, And sprinkles diamonds o'er the earth; While in the green wood's shade profound The insect race, with buzzing sound, Flit o'er the rill—a glitt'ring train, Or swarm along the sultry plain; Then in sweet converse let us rove Where, in the thyme-embroider'd grove, The musky air its fragrance pours Upon the silv'ry scatter'd show'rs; To hail soft Zephyr, as she goes To fan the dew-drop from the rose; To shelter from the scorching beam, And muse beside the rippling stream. Or when, at twilight's placid hour, We stroll to some sequester'd bow'r, And watch the haughty Sun retire Beneath his canopy of fire; While slow the dusky clouds enfold Day's crimson curtains fring'd with gold, And o'er the meadows faintly fly Pale shadows of the purpling sky; While softly o'er the pearl-deck'd plain Cold Dian leads the sylvan train; In mazy dance and sportive glee, Sweet Muse, I'll fondly turn to thee; And thou shalt deck my couch with flow'rs, And wing with joy my silent hours. When Sleep, with downy hand, shall spread A wreath of poppies round my head, Then Fancy on her wing sublime, Shall waft me to the sacred clime Where my enlighten'd sense shall view, Thro' ether, realms of azure hue, That flame where Shakespeare us'd to fill. With matchless fire, his “golden quill.” While from its point bright Genius caught The wit supreme, the glowing thought, The magic tone, that sweetly hung About the numbers which he sung. Then will I skim the floating air, On a light couch of gossamer, While with my wonder-aching eye I contemplate the spangled sky, And hear the vaulted roof repeat The song of Inspiration sweet; While round the winged cherub train Shall iterate the aëry strain; Swift thro' my quiv'ring nerves shall float The tremours of each thrilling note; And every eager sense confess Ecstatic transport's wild excess; Till, waking from the glorious dream, I hail the morn's refulgent beam. Dear Maid! of ever-varying mien, Exulting, pensive, gay, serene, Now, in transcendent pathos drest, Now, gentle as the turtle's breast; Where'er thy feath'ry steps shall lead, To side-long hill, or flow'ry mead; To sorrow's coldest, darkest cell, Or where, by Cynthia's glimm'ring ray, The dapper fairies frisk and play About some cowslip's golden bell; And, in their wanton frolic mirth, Pluck the young daisies from the earth, To canopy their tiny heads, And decorate their verdant beds; While, to the grasshopper's shrill tune, They quaff libations to the moon, From acorn goblets, amply fill'd With dew, from op'ning flow'rs distill'd— Or when the lurid tempest pours, From its dark urn, impetuous show'rs; Or from its brow's terrific frown Hurls the pale murd'rous lightnings down; To thy enchanting breast I'll spring, And shield me with thy golden wing. Or when, amidst ethereal fire, Thou strik'st thy Della Cruscan lyre, While round, to catch the heavenly song, Myriads of wond'ring seraphs throng; Whether thy harp's empassioned strain Pours forth an Ovid's tender pain, Or in Pindaric flights sublime Re-echoes through the starry clime; Thee I'll adore, transcendent guest, And woo thee to my burning breast. But if thy magic pow'rs impart One soft sensation to the heart, If thy warm precepts can dispense One thrilling transport o'er my sense; Oh! keep thy gifts, and let me fly, In Apathy's cold arm to die. ODE TO DELLA CRUSCA. Enlighten'd Patron of the sacred Lyre! Whose ever-varying, ever-witching song Revibrates on the heart With magic thrilling touch, Till ev'ry nerve, with quiv'ring throb divine, In madd'ning tumults, owns thy wondrous pow'r; For well thy dulcet notes Can wind the mazy song, In labyrinth of wild fantastic form; Or with empassion'd pathos woo the soul With sounds more sweetly mild Than Sappho's plaint forlorn, When bending o'er the waves she sung her woes, And pitying Echo hover'd o'er the deep, Till in their coral caves The tuneful Nereids wept. Ah! whither art thou flown? where pours thy song? The model and the pride of British bards! Sweet Star of Fancy's orb, “O tell me, tell me, where?” Say, dost thou waste it on the viewless air That bears it to the confines of high Heav'n? Or does it court the meed Of proud pre-eminence? Or steals it o'er the glitt'ring Sapphire wave, Calming the tempest with its silver sounds? Or does it charm to love The fond believing maid? Or does it hover o'er the Alpine steep, Or, softly breathing under myrtle shades, With Sympathy divine, Solace the child of woe? Where'er thou art, Oh! let thy gentle strain Again with magic pow'r delight mine ear, Untutor'd in the spells And mysteries of song. Then, on the margin of the deep I'll muse, And bless the rocking bark ordain'd to bear My sad heart o'er the wave, From this ungrateful isle; When the wan queen of night, with languid eye, Peeps o'er the mountain's head, or thro' the vale Illumes the glassy brook, Or dew-besprinkled heath, Or with her crystal lamp directs the feet Of the benighted Trav'ller, cold and sad, Thro' the long forest drear, And pathless labyrinth, To the poor Peasant's hospitable cot, For ever open to the wretch forlorn; O then I'll think on Thee, And iterate thy strain, And chant thy matchless numbers o'er and o'er; And I will court the sullen ear of night, To bear the rapt'rous sound, On her dark shadowy wing, To where, encircled by the sacred Nine, The Lyre awakes the never-dying song! Now, Bard admir'd, farewell! The white sail flutters loud, The gaudy streamers lengthen in the gale, Far from my native shore I bend my way; Yet, as my aching eye Shall view the less'ning cliff, Till its stupendous head shall scarce appear Above the surface of the swelling deep, I'll snatch a ray of hope, For Hope's the lamp divine That lights and vivifies the fainting soul, With ecstacies beyond the pow'rs of song! That ere I reach those banks Where the loud Tiber flows, Or milder Arno slowly steals along, To the soft music of the summer breeze, The wafting wing of Time May bear this last Adieu, This wild, untutor'd picture of the heart, To him whose magic verse inspir'd the Strain. ODE TO GENIUS. Now by th' Aonian Nymphs inspir'd, By glowing emulation fir'd! Of thee I'll sing.—Illustrious Maid! In peerless majesty array'd! Who, all creative, all sublime, First sprang from the ethereal clime, To bid enraptur'd fancy trace The bright infinity of space, Where Fame of pure celestial birth A starry wreath prepares to crown immortal worth! Blest Genius! pow'r divine! Now shall the votive song be thine! Nor thou the pensive muse disdain, Who oft, by fancy led, shall rove To soft Arcadia's myrtle grove, And tune the past'ral reed or chant the sylvan strain. Or could her trembling hand aspire To wake the loud resounding Lyre, Where Pindus rears its haughty crest, By thy immortal Laurels drest! Or on Parnassian heights sublime Snatch from the passing wing of Time A Plume, that smiling Hope might lave Deep in the Heliconian wave! For thee her burning hand should fling Ecstatic measures o'er the bounding string! Nor thou, star-crested Nymph! refuse The off'rings of an untaught Muse, Who twines, amidst uncultivated bow'rs, A small, but fragrant wreath, of Nature's simplest Flow'rs. Proud Parent of supreme delight! Thou Sun! from whose rich source The lustrous stream of mental sight Points to mortality a glorious course! 'Tis thine with magic sweet control To guide the timid sensate soul; To mark, on Truth's enlighten'd page, In ev'ry clime, in ev'ry age, How empty earthly pow'r appears, A glitt'ring Phantom! fraught with Fears! How dark the rugged paths of Life! How planted with the thorns of strife! How paltry Wealth! how false the glare That dazzles round the Regal Chair! How fragile Beauty's blush! how poor The Miser, 'midst his countless store! When o'er the lab'ring Sons of Clay Thou scorn'st to spread sublime thy broad effulgent Ray! O Genius! at thy view, Low in the dust, the grovelling crew Fall, stricken like the summer Fly, 'Midst torrid radiance doom'd to die; Whilst thou! whose tow'ring mind No base or sordid spells can bind, Far, far from human woe canst rise, To purer joys! to brighter skies! As the triumphant eagle bends his flight, To lave his Lordly Wing in Floods of burning Light! Oft have I seen thee, sportive! wild! Frolic Nature's playful child! With infant sweetness, weaving boughs, To hang on fickle Fancy's brows! Then wouldst thou snatch the rose-deck'd Lyre, And with thy airy fingers play, In measures madly gay, A song that might e'en Apathy inspire! Then, sated with the 'witching sound, Dash thy rapt Lyre upon the ground! And o'er thy gaudy wreath Such strains of tender Pity breathe, So soft! so touching! so alluring! All the wounds of Passion curing! That madd'ning Rage itself, subdu'd, List'ning stood, in melting mood! And Folly, wond'ring at thy pow'rs, Dropp'd from her giddy hand her Wreath of pois'nous Flow'rs! I've seen thee, spurning solemn Fools, Mock the vaunted lore of schools; And laugh to scorn the Pedant's art, That hides, in Learning's Garb, the dull deceitful Heart! I've seen thee, dress'd in awful pride, With calm-brow'd Wisdom by thy side, Unfolding precepts richly fraught With Sense acute! and Depth of Thought! Decking the hoary front of Time With many a sober wreath, sublime! While Eloquence, her store unbound, Scatter'd her fairest blossoms round! And Hist'ry, with recording finger, trac'd Scenes by expiring Ignorance half-effac'd; Whilst Thou from cold Oblivion's cave Led the pale shadows of the sainted Brave! Ah! then I've seen thee stamp each name On the unperishable rolls of Fame! And, smiling o'er the consecrated page, Anticipate the Boast of many a future Age! I've seen thee through the soul diffuse Th' electric fire that warms the Muse! When o'er the Poet's breast Thou fling'st thy sunny vest; And stoop'st his throbbing brow to bind With wings, to waft the soaring mind Beyond the mists of mortal day! While from thy piercing eye, Resplendent as its Parent Sky, A stream of light shot forth, to mark his glorious Way! Ah! lost to bliss are those, Low-thoughted! dull of Soul! Who, plodding through life's weedy woes, Ne'er felt the thrilling pow'r That marks the intellectual hour; Nor, where Pierian fountains roll, Panted to taste the clear immortal wave That heals the wounds of Fate, and flows beyond the Grave! ODE TO REFLECTION. O thou! whose sober precepts can control The wild impatience of the troubled soul, Sweet Maid serene! whose all consoling pow'r Awakes to calm delight the ling'ring hour, O! hear thy Votary's ardent pray'r! Chase from my anguish'd mind corroding care, Steal thro' the burning pulses of my brain, Calm sorrow to repose, and lull the throb of pain! O, tell me, what are life's best joys? Are they not visions that decay, Sweet honey'd poisons, gilded toys, Vain glitt'ring baubles of a day? O say, what shadow do they leave behind, Save the sad vacuum of a sated mind? Borne on the eagle-wings of Fame, Man soars above calm reason's sway, “Vaulting ambition” mocks each tender claim, Plucks the dear bonds of social life away; As o'er the vanquish'd slave she wields her spear, Compassion turns aside—Reflection drops a tear. Behold the wretch whose sordid heart, Steep'd in Content's oblivious balm, Secure in Luxury's bewitching calm, Repels pale Mis'ry's touch, and mocks Affliction's smart; Unmov'd he marks the bitter tear, In vain the plaints of woe his thoughts assail, The bashful mourner's piteous tale Nor melts his flinty soul, nor vibrates on his ear. O blest Reflection! let thy magic pow'r Awake his torpid sense, his slumb'ring thought, Tell him Adversity's unpitied hour A brighter lesson gives than Stoics taught: Tell him that Wealth no blessing can impart So sweet as Pity's tear—that bathes the wounded Heart. Go tell the vain, the insolent, and fair, That life's best days are only days of care; That Beauty, flutt'ring like a painted fly, Owes to the spring of youth its transient die; When Winter comes, its charms shall fade away, And the poor insect wither in decay: Go bid the giddy phantom learn from thee, That Virtue only braves mortality. Then come, Reflection, soft-ey'd maid! I know thee, and I prize thy charms; Come, in thy gentlest smiles array'd, And I will press thee in my eager arms; Keep from my aching heart the fiend Despair, Snatch from my brow her thorn, and plant thy olive there. ODE TO ENVY. Deep in th' abyss where frantic horror 'bides, In thickest mists of vapours fell, Where wily Serpents hissing glare And the dark Demon of Revenge resides, At midnight's murky hour Thy origin began: Rapacious Malice was thy sire; Thy Dam the sullen witch, Despair; Thy Nurse, insatiate Ire. The Fates conspir'd their ills to twine About thy heart's infected shrine; They gave thee each disastrous spell, Each desolating pow'r, To blast the fairest hopes of man. Soon as thy fatal birth was known, From her unhallow'd throne With ghastly smile pale Hecate sprang; Thy hideous form the Sorc'ress press'd With kindred fondness to her breast; Her haggard eye Shot forth a ray of transient joy, While thro' the infernal shades exulting clamours rang. Above thy fellow-fiends thy tyrant hand Grasp'd with resistless force supreme command: The vast terrific crowd Before thy iron sceptre bow'd. Now, seated in thy ebon cave, About thy throne relentless furies rave; A wreath of ever-wounding thorn Thy scowling brows encompass round, Thy heart by gnawing Vultures torn, Thy meagre limbs with deathless scorpions bound: Thy black associates, torpid Ignorance, And pining Jealousy—with eye askance, With savage rapture execute thy will, And strew the paths of life with every torturing ill. Nor can the sainted dead escape thy rage; Thy vengeance haunts the silent grave, Thy taunts insult the ashes of the brave; While proud Ambition weeps thy rancour to assuage. The laurels round the Poet's bust, Twin'd by the liberal hand of Taste, By thy malignant grasp defac'd, Fade to their native dust: Thy ever-watchful eye no labour tires, Beneath thy venom'd touch the angel Truth expires. When in thy petrifying car Thy scaly dragons waft thy form, Then, swifter, deadlier far Than the keen lightning's lance, That wings its way across the yelling storm, Thy barbed shafts fly whizzing round, While every with'ring glance Inflicts a cureless wound. Thy giant-arm with pond'rous blow Hurls genius from her glorious height, Bends the fair front of Virtue low, And meanly pilfers every pure delight. Thy hollow voice the sense appals, Thy vigilance the mind inthrals; Rest hast thou none! By night, by day, Thy jealous ardour seeks for prey— Nought can restrain thy swift career; Thy smile derides the suff'rer's wrongs; Thy tongue the sland'rer's tale prolongs; Thy thirst imbibes the victim's tear; Thy breast recoils from friendship's flame; Sick'ning thou hear'st the trump of Fame; Worth gives to thee the direst pang; The Lover's rapture wounds thy heart, The proudest efforts of prolific art Shrink from thy poisonous fang. In vain the Sculptor's lab'ring hand Calls fine proportion from the Parian stone; In vain the Minstrel's chords command The soft vibrations of seraphic tone; For swift thy violating arm Tears from perfection ev'ry charm: Nor rosy Youth, nor Beauty's smiles, Thy unrelenting rage beguiles; Thy breath contaminates the fairest name, And binds the guiltless brow with ever-blist'ring shame. ODE TO HEALTH. Come, bright-eyed maid, Pure offspring of the tranquil mind, Haste, my fev'rish temples bind With olive wreaths of em'rald hue, Steep'd in morn's ethereal dew, Where, in mild Helvetia's shade, Blushing summer round her flings Warm gales and sunny show'rs that hang upon her wings. I'll seek thee in Italia's bow'rs, Where, supine on beds of flow'rs, Melody's soul-touching throng Strike the soft lute or trill the melting song: Where blithe Fancy, queen of pleasure, Pours each luxuriant treasure. For thee I'll climb the breezy hill, While the balmy dews distil Odours from the budding thorn, Dropp'd from the lustrous lids of morn; Who, starting from her shadowy bed, Binds her gold fillet round the mountain's head. There I'll press from herbs and flow'rs Juices bless'd with opiate pow'rs, Whose magic potency can heal The throb of agonizing pain, And thro' the purple swelling vein With subtle influence steal: Heav'n opes for thee its aromatic store, To bathe each languid gasping pore; But where, O where, shall cherish'd sorrow find The lenient balm to soothe the feeling mind. O mem'ry! busy barb'rous foe, At thy fell touch I wake to woe: Alas, the flatt'ring dream is o'er, From thee the bright illusions fly, Thou bidst the glitt'ring phantoms die, And hope, and youth, and fancy, charm no more. No more for me the tip-toe Spring Drops flow'rets from her infant wing; For me in vain the wild thyme's bloom Thro' the forest flings perfume; In vain I climb th' embroider'd hill To breathe the clear autumnal air; In vain I quaff the lucid rill Since jocund Health delights not there To greet my heart:?no more I view, With sparkling eye, the silv'ry dew Sprinkling May's tears upon the folded rose, As low it droops its young and blushing head, Press'd by grey twilight to its mossy bed: No more I lave amidst the tide, Or bound along the tufted grove, Or o'er enamell'd meadows rove, Where, on Zephyr's pinions, glide Salubrious airs that waft the day's repose. Lightly o'er the yellow heath Steals thy soft and fragrant breath, Breath inhal'd from musky flow'rs, Newly bath'd in perfum'd show'rs. See the rosy-finger'd morn Opes her bright refulgent eye, Hills and valleys to adorn, While from her burning glance the scatter'd vapours fly. Soon, ah soon! the painted scene, The hill's blue top, the valley's green, 'Midst clouds of snow and whirlwinds drear, Shall cold and comfortless appear: The howling blast shall strip the plain, And bid my pensive bosom learn, Tho' Nature's face shall smile again, And on the glowing breast of spring Creation all her gems shall fling, Youth's April-morn shall ne'er return. Then come, Oh! quickly come, Hygeian Maid! Each throbbing pulse, each quiv'ring nerve pervade. Flash thy bright fires across my languid eye, Tint my pale visage with thy roseate dye, Bid my heart's current own a temp'rate glow, And from its crimson source in tepid channels flow. O Health, celestial Nymph! without thy aid Creation sickens in oblivion's shade: Along the drear and solitary gloom We steal on thorny footsteps to the tomb; Youth, age, wealth, poverty, alike agree— To live is anguish, when depriv'd of Thee. To Thee indulgent Heav'n benignly gave The touch to heal, the ecstacy to save. The balmy incense of thy fost'ring breath Wafts the wan victim from the fangs of Death, Robs the grim Tyrant of his trembling prize, Cheers the faint soul, and lifts it to the skies. Let not the gentle rose thy bounty drest To meet the rising sun with perfum'd breast, Which glow'd with lustrous tints at noon-tide hour, And shed soft tears upon each drooping flower, With with'ring anguish mourn the parting Day, Shrink to the Earth, and sorrowing fade away. ODE TO VANITY. Insatiate Tyrant of the Mind, Fantastic, aëry, empty thing, Borne on Illusion's flutt'ring wing, Fallacious as the wanton wind; Capricious Goddess!—Beauty's foe; Thou—who no settled home dost know; The busy World, the sylvan Plain, Alike confess thy potent reign. Queen of the motley garb—at thy command Fashion waves her flow'ry wand; See she kindles Fancy's flame, Around her dome thy incense flies, The curling fumes ascend the skies, And fill the “Trump of Fame.” When Heaven's translucent ray Unveil'd the mighty work of God; When the Promethean spark of day Awoke his Image from a torpid clod; When radiance pour'd on human sight, And the illumin'd Soul beam'd with celestial light; Exulting Man, sole Potentate below, First felt thy pois'nous glow; He gaz'd upon his wondrous frame; The self-approving conscious flame Thrill'd in each trembling vein with subtle art, Then fix'd its baneful source within his godlike Heart. Thy breath accurs'd brought deathless woe On Man's devoted race; Hurl'd th' aspiring Fiend to realms below, Who, plung'd in fell disgrace, There, deep inthrall'd in adamantine spells, In chains of scorpions bound, for ever, ever dwells. In ev'ry scene of social joy, Amidst the rude unpolish'd train, From the low offspring of the barren plain, To him whose lofty bosom owns Descent sublime from scepter'd thrones, All, all thy laws obey. Thy light hand plumes the warrior's brow, Decks e'en fierce war with tinsel show, E'en in the tented fields thy banners flow, To thee illustrious Chieftains bow; 'Tis thy capricious influence forms All that mad ambition warms; The laurel wreath, tho' steep'd in blood, Plac'd by thy fickle hand, appears Radiant as the sunny spheres, When Morn's proud beams roll in a golden flood. Ah, Vanity! avert thine eye; Check thy fell exulting joy; With burning drops thy flush'd cheek lave, Nor gloat upon the carnag'd brave; For what can trophied wreaths supply, To drown the desolating cry, That, o'er th' empurpled fields afar, Proclaims the dread-destructive pow'r of War? E'en amidst the savage race, The untam'd Indian owns thy sway; For thee he paints his tawny face, And decks his shaggy hair with fragments gay: For thee he marks his sun-burnt breast, With beads and feathers idly drest;— His hardy limbs with glowing tints imbru'd, Reeking and mangled with the pointed dart, Vainly he vaunts—nor heeds the smart, Tho' pitying Nature weeps with tears of blood. Then turn, my Muse, where milder joys The village hero's mind employs; Where gentler sports delight the breast, And soften'd Nature smiles confest. Let me paint the rural scene, The white-wash'd hut—the velvet green, May's blithe morn—exulting glee, The chaplet pendant on each tree, The shining hat with gaudy ribbands bound, The lofty may-pole and the well-swept ground, Where valiant combats speak the thirst of Fame, And the loud shout proclaims the victor's name. O Vanity, thy potent reign Spreads its influence o'er the plain— For thee, the blushing maids prepare Garlands wove with nicest care; For thee, they dress their festive bow'rs With waving wreaths of scented flow'rs, Where the bold Youth that wins the prize Reads his best Victory in his Sweetheart's Eyes. Such is thy pow'r—thy mandate rules Above the laws of Pedant-Schools; Reason in vain contends with Thee, Triumphant, Deathless Vanity! E'en now I feel thy vivid sparks infuse A warmth that guides my hand, and bids me court the Muse. ODE TO MELANCHOLY. Sorc'ress of the Cave profound! Hence, with thy pale and meagre train, Nor dare my roseate bow'r profane, Where light-heel'd mirth despotic reigns, Slightly bound in feath'ry chains, And scatt'ring blisses round. Hence, to thy native Chaos—where, Nurs'd by thy haggard Dam, Despair, Shackled by thy numbing spell, Mis'ry's pallid children dwell; Where, brooding o'er thy fatal charms, Frenzy rolls the vacant eye; Where hopeless Love, with folded arms, Drops the tear, and heaves the sigh; Till cherish'd Passion's tyrant-sway Chills the warm pulse of Youth with premature decay. O fly Thee to some Church-yard's gloom, Where, beside the mould'ring tomb, Restless Spectres glide away, Fading in the glimpse of Day; Or, where the Virgin Orb of Night Silvers o'er the Forest wide, Or across the silent tide, Flings her soft and quiv'ring light: Where, beneath some aged Tree, Sounds of mournful Melody, Caught from the Nightingale's enamour'd Tale, Steal on faint Echo's ear, and float upon the gale. Dread Pow'r! whose touch magnetic leads O'er enchanted spangled meads, Where, by the glow-worm's twinkling ray, Aëry Spirits lightly play; Where, around some Haunted Tow'r, Boding Ravens wing their flight, Viewless, in the gloom of Night, Warning oft the luckless hour; Or, beside the Murd'rer's bed, From thy dark and morbid wing, O'er his fev'rish, burning head, Drops of conscious anguish fling; While freezing Horror's direful scream Rouses his guilty soul from kind oblivion's dream. Oft, beneath the witching Yew, The trembling Maid steals forth unseen, With true-love wreaths, of deathless green, Her lover's grave to strew; Her downcast Eye no joy illumes, Nor on her Cheek the soft Rose blooms; Her mourning Heart, the victim of thy pow'r, Shrinks from the glare of Mirth, and hails the murky hour. O, say what Fiend first gave thee birth, In what fell Desert wert thou born; Why does thy hollow voice, forlorn, So fascinate the Sons of Earth; That, once encircled in thy icy arms, They court thy torpid touch, and doat upon thy Charms? Hated Imp—I brave thy Spell, Reason shuns thy barb'rous sway; Life with mirth should glide away, Despondency with guilt should dwell; For conscious Truth's unruffled mien Displays the dauntless Eye and patient smile serene. ODE TO DESPAIR. Terrific Fiend! thou Monster fell! Condemn'd in haunts profane to dwell, Why quit thy solitary Home, O'er wide Creation's paths to roam? Pale Tyrant of the timid Heart, Whose visionary spells can bind The strongest passions of the mind, Freezing Life's current with thy baneful Art. Nature recoils when thou art near, For round thy form all plagues are seen; Thine is the frantic tone, the sullen mien, The glance of petrifying fear, The haggard Brow, the low'ring Eye, The hollow Cheek, the smother'd Sigh; When thy usurping fangs assail, The sacred Bonds of Friendship fail. Meek-bosom'd Pity sues in vain; Imperious Sorrow spurns relief, Feeds on the luxury of Grief, Drinks the hot Tear, and hugs the galling Chain. Ah! plunge no more thy ruthless dart In the dark centre of the guilty Heart; The Pow'r Supreme, with pitying eye, Looks on the erring Child of Misery; Mercy arrests the wing of Time, To expiate the wretch's crime: Insulted Heav'n consign'd thy brand To the first Murd'rer's crimson hand. Swift o'er the earth the Monster flew, And round th' ensanguin'd Poisons threw, By Conscience goaded—driven by Fear, Till the meek Cherub Hope subdued his fell career. Thy Reign is past, when erst the brave Imbib'd contagion o'er the midnight lamp, Close pent in loathsome cells, where poisons damp Hung round the confines of a Living Grave; Where no glimm'ring ray illum'd The flinty walls, where pond'rous chains Bound the wan Victim to the humid earth, Where Valour, Genius, Taste, and Worth, In pestilential caves entomb'd, Sought thy cold arms, and smiling mock'd their pains. There,—each procrastinated hour, The woe-worn suff'rer gasping lay, While by his side in proud array Stalk'd the Huge Fiend, Despotic Pow'r. There Reason clos'd her radiant eye, And fainting Hope retir'd to die, Truth shrunk appall'd, In spells of icy Apathy inthrall'd; Till Freedom spurn'd the ignominious chain, And, roused from Superstition's night, Exulting Nature claim'd her right, And call'd dire Vengeance from her dark domain. Now take thy solitary flight Amid the turbid gales of night, Where Spectres, starting from the tomb, Glide along th' impervious gloom; Or, stretch'd upon the sea-beat shore, Let the wild winds, as they roar, Rock Thee on thy Bed of Stone; Or, in gelid caverns pent, Listen to the sullen moan Of subterraneous winds;—or glut thy sight Where stupendous mountains, rent, Hurl their vast fragments from their dizzy height. At Thy approach the rifted Pine Shall o'er the shatter'd Rock incline, Whose trembling brow, with wild weeds drest, Frowns on the tawny Eagle's nest; There enjoy the 'witching hour, And freeze in Frenzy's dire conceit, Or seek the Screech-owl's lone retreat, On the bleak rampart of some nodding Tow'r. In some forest long and drear, Tempt the fierce Banditti's rage, War with famish'd Tigers wage, And bathe in blood, and mock the taunts of Fear. When across the yawning deep The Demons of the Tempest sweep, Or deaf'ning Thunders bursting cast Their red bolts on the shivering mast, While fix'd below the sea-boy stands, As threat'ning Death his soul dismays, He lifts his supplicating hands, And shrieks, and groans, and weeps, and prays, Till, lost amid the floating fire, The agonizing crew expire; Then let thy transports rend the air, For madd'ning Anguish feeds the fiend Despair! When o'er the couch of pale Disease The Mother bends with tearful eye, And trembles, lest her quiv'ring sigh Should wake the darling of her breast— Now, by the taper's feeble rays, She steals a last, fond, eager gaze. Ah, hapless parent! gaze no more, Thy Cherub soars among the Blest, Life's crimson Fount begins to freeze, His transitory scene is o'er— She starts—she raves—her burning brain Consumes, unconscious of its fires; Dead to the Heart's convulsive Pain, Bewilder'd Memory retires. See! See! she grasps her flowing hair, From her fix'd eye the big drops roll, Her proud Affliction mocks control, And riots in Despair— Such are thy haunts, malignant Pow'r! There all thy murd'rous Poisons show'r; But come not near my calm retreat, Where Peace and holy Friendship meet; Where Science sheds a gentle ray, And guiltless Mirth beguiles the day, Where Bliss congenial to the Muse Shall round my Heart her sweets diffuse, Where, from each restless Passion free, I give my noiseless hours, bless'd poesy, to thee. ODE TO THE SNOW-DROP. The Snow-drop, Winter's timid child, Awakes to life, bedew'd with tears, And flings around its fragrance mild; And where no rival flow'rets bloom, Amidst the bare and chilling gloom, A beauteous gem appears! All weak and wan, with head inclin'd, Its parent-breast the drifted snow, It trembles, while the ruthless wind Bends its slim form; the tempest lowers, Its em'rald eye drops crystal show'rs On its cold bed below. Poor flow'r! on thee the sunny beam No touch of genial warmth bestows! Except to thaw the icy stream Whose little current purls along, And whelms thee as it flows. The night-breeze tears thy silky dress, Which deck'd with silv'ry lustre shone; The morn returns, not thee to bless.— The gaudy Crocus flaunts its pride, And triumphs where its rival—died Unshelter'd and unknown! No sunny beam shall gild thy grave, No bird of pity thee deplore: There shall no verdant branches wave, For spring shall all her gems unfold, And revel 'midst her beds of gold, When thou art seen no more! Where'er I find thee, gentle flow'r, Thou still art sweet, and dear to me! For I have known the cheerless hour, Have seen the sun-beams cold and pale, Have felt the chilling, wint'ry gale, And wept, and shrunk like thee! ODE TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Sweet Bird of Sorrow!—why complain In such soft melody of Song? That Echo, am'rous of thy Strain, The ling'ring cadence doth prolong. Ah! tell me, tell me, why Thy dulcet Notes ascend the sky, Or on the filmy vapours glide Along the misty mountain's side? And wherefore dost Thou love to dwell In the dark wood and moss-grown cell? Beside the willow-margin'd stream— Why dost Thou court wan Cynthia's beam? Sweet Songstress—if thy wayward fate Hath robb'd Thee of thy bosom's mate, Oh! think not thy heart-piercing moan Evap'rates on the breezy air, Or that the plaintive Song of Care Steals from thy Widow'd Breast alone. Oft have I heard thy mournful Tale, On the high Cliff, that o'er the Vale Hangs its dark brow, whose awful shade Spreads a deep gloom along the glade: Led by its sound, I've wander'd far, Till crimson evening's flaming Star On Heav'n's vast dome refulgent hung, And round ethereal vapours flung; And oft I've sought th' Hygeian Maid, In rosy dimpling smiles array'd, Till, forc'd with every Hope to part, Resistless Pain subdued my Heart. Oh then, far o'er the restless deep Forlorn my poignant pangs I bore, Alone in foreign realms to weep, Where Envy's voice could taunt no more. I hop'd, by mingling with the gay, To snatch the veil of Grief away; I hop'd, amid the joyous train, To break Affliction's pond'rous chain; Vain was the Hope—in vain I sought The placid hour of careless thought; Where Fashion wing'd her light career, And sportive Pleasure danc'd along, Oft have I shunn'd the blithsome throng, To hide th' involuntary tear; For e'en where rapt'rous transports glow, From the full Heart the conscious tear will flow. When to my downy couch remov'd, Fancy recalled my wearied mind To scenes of Friendship left behind, Scenes still regretted, still belov'd! Ah! then I felt the pangs of Grief Grasp my warm Heart, and mock relief; My burning lids Sleep's balm defied, And on my fev'rish lip imperfect murmurs died. Restless and sad—I sought once more A calm retreat on Britain's shore; Deceitful Hope! e'en there I found That soothing Friendship's specious name Was but a short-liv'd empty sound, And Love a false delusive flame. Then come, Sweet Bird, and with thy strain Steal from my breast the thorn of pain; Blest solace of my lonely hours, In craggy caves and silent bow'rs: When happy Mortals seek repose, By Night's pale lamp we'll chant our woes, And, as her chilling tears diffuse O'er the white thorn their silv'ry dews, I'll with the lucid boughs entwine A weeping Wreath, which round my Head Shall by the waning Crescent shine, And light us to our leafy bed.— Yet, ah! nor leafy beds nor bow'rs Fring'd with soft May's enamell'd flow'rs, Nor pearly leaves, nor Cynthia's beams, Nor smiling Pleasure's shadowy dreams— Sweet Bird, not e'en thy melting Strains— Can calm the heart where Tyrant Sorrow reigns. SECOND ODE TO THE NIGHTINGALE. Blest be thy song, sweet Nightingale, Lorn minstrel of the lonely vale! Where oft I've heard thy dulcet strain In mournful melody complain; When in the Poplar's trembling shade At Evening's purple hour I've stray'd, While many a silken folded flow'r Wept on its couch of Gossamer, And many a time in pensive mood Upon the upland mead I've stood, To mark grey twilight's shadows glide Along the green hill's velvet side; To watch the perfum'd hand of morn Hang pearls upon the silver thorn, Till rosy day with lustrous eye In saffron mantle deck'd the sky, And bound the mountain's brow with fire, And ting'd with gold the village spire, While o'er the frosted vale below The amber tints began to glow: And oft I seek the daisied plain To greet the rustic nymph and swain, When cowslips gay their bells unfold, And flaunt their leaves of glitt'ring gold, While from the blushes of the rose A tide of musky essence flows, And o'er the odour-breathing flow'rs The woodlands shed their diamond show'rs; When from the scented hawthorn bud The Blackbird sips the lucid flood, While oft the twitt'ring Thrush essays To emulate the Linnet's lays; While the poiz'd Lark her carol sings And Butterflies expand their wings, And Bees begin their sultry toils And load their limbs with luscious spoils, I stroll along the pathless vale, And smile, and bless thy soothing tale. But ah! when hoary winter chills The plumy race—and wraps the hills In snowy vest, I tell my pains Beside the brook, in icy chains, Bound its weedy banks between, While sad I watch night's pensive queen, Just emblem of my weary woes; For ah! where'er the virgin goes, Each flow'ret greets her with a tear To sympathetic sorrow dear; And when in black obtrusive clouds The vestal meek her pale cheek shrouds, I mark the twinkling starry train Exulting glitter in her wane, And proudly gleam their borrow'd light To gem the sombre dome of night. Then o'er the meadows cold and bleak The glow-worm's glimm'ring lamp I seek, Or climb the craggy cliff, to gaze On some bright planet's azure blaze, And o'er the dizzy height inclin'd I listen to the passing wind, That loves my mournful song to seize, And bears it to the mountain breeze. Or where, the sparry caves among, Dull Echo sits with aëry tongue, Or gliding on the Zephyr's wings From hill to hill her cadence flings, O then my melancholy tale Dies on the bosom of the gale, While awful stillness, reigning round, Blanches my cheek with chilling fear; Till, from the bushy dell profound, The woodman's song salutes mine ear. When dark November's boist'rous breath Sweeps the blue hill and desert heath, When naked trees their white tops wave O'er many a famish'd Redbreast's grave, When many a clay-built cot lays low Beneath the growing hills of snow; Soon as the Shepherd's silv'ry head Peeps from his tottering straw-roof'd shed, To hail the glimm'ring glimpse of day— With feeble steps he ventures forth, Chill'd by the bleak breath of the North, And to the forest bends his way, To gather from the frozen ground Each branch the night-blast scatter'd round— If in some bush o'erspread with snow He hears thy moaning wail of woe, A flush of warmth his cheek o'erspreads, With anxious timid care he treads, And when his cautious hands infold Thy little breast benumb'd with cold, “Come, plaintive fugitive,” he cries, While Pity dims his aged eyes, “Come up to my glowing heart, and share “My narrow cell, my humble fare; “Tune thy sweet carol—plume thy wing, “And quaff with me the limpid spring, “And peck the crumbs my meals supply, “And round my rushy pillow fly.” O, Minstrel sweet, whose jocund lay Can make e'en Poverty look gay, Who can the humblest swain inspire And, while he fans his scanty fire, When o'er the plain rough Winter pours Nocturnal blasts and whelming show'rs, Canst thro' his little mansion fling The rapt'rous melodies of spring— To thee with eager gaze I turn, Blest solace of the aching breast! Each gaudy glitt'ring scene I spurn, And sigh for solitude and rest. ODE TO BEAUTY. Exulting Beauty!—phantom of an hour, Whose magic spells enchain the heart, Ah! what avails thy fascinating pow'r, Thy thrilling smile, thy witching art? Thy lip, where balmy nectar glows; Thy cheek, where round the damask rose A thousand nameless Graces move; Thy mildly-speaking azure eyes, Thy golden hair, where cunning Love In many a mazy ringlet lies? Soon as thy radiant form is seen, Thy native blush, thy timid mien, Thy hour is past! thy charms are vain! Ill-Nature haunts thee with her sallow train, Mean Jealousy deceives thy list'ning ear, And Slander stains thy cheek with many a bitter tear, In calm retirement form'd to dwell, Nature, thy handmaid fair and kind, For thee a beauteous garland twin'd; The vale-nurs'd Lily's downcast bell Thy modest mien display'd, The snow-drop, April's meekest child, With myrtle blossoms undefil'd, Thy spotless mind pourtray'd. Dear blushing maid, of cottage birth, 'Twas thine o'er dewy meads to stray, While sparkling health, and frolic mirth, Led on thy laughing Day. Lur'd by the babbling tongue of Fame, Too soon insidious Flatt'ry came; Flush'd Vanity her footsteps led, To charm thee from repose, While Fashion twin'd about thy head A wreath of wounding woes; See Dissipation smoothly glide, Cold Apathy, and puny Pride, Capricious Fortune, dull and blind, O'er splendid Folly throws her veil, While Envy's meagre tribe assail Thy gentle form and spotless mind. Their spells prevail! no more those eyes Shoot undulating fires; On thy wan cheek the young rose dies, Thy lip's deep tint expires; Dark Melancholy chills thy mind, Thy silent tear reveals thy woe; Time strews with thorns thy mazy way; Where'er thy giddy footsteps stray, Thy thoughtless heart is doom'd to find An unrelenting foe. 'Tis thus the infant Forest flow'r, Bespangled o'er with glitt'ring dew, At breezy morn's refreshing hour, Displays its tints of varying hue, Beneath an aged oak's wide spreading shade, Where no rude winds or beating storms invade. Transplanted from its lonely bed, No more it scatters perfumes round, No more it rears its modest head, Or gayly paints the mossy ground; For ah! the beauteous bud, too soon, Scorch'd by the burning eye of day, Shrinks from the sultry glare of noon, Droops its enamell'd brow, and, blushing, dies away. ODE TO ELOQUENCE. Hail! Goddess of persuasive art! The magic of whose tuneful tongue Lulls to soft harmony the wand'ring heart With fascinating song; O let me hear thy heav'n-taught strain, As thro' my quiv'ring pulses steal The mingling throbs of joy and pain, Which only sensate minds can feel. Ah! let me taste the bliss supreme Which thy warm touch unerring flings O'er the rapt sense's finest strings, When Genius, darting from the sky, Glances across my wond'ring eye Her animating beam. Sweet Eloquence! thy mild control Awakes to Reason's dawn the Idiot soul; When mists absorb the mental sight, 'Tis thine to dart creative light; 'Tis thine to chase the filmy clouds away, And o'er the mind's deep gloom spread a refulgent ray. Nor is thy wondrous art confin'd Within the bounds of mental space, For thou canst boast exterior grace, Bright emblem of the fertile mind; Yes; I have seen thee, with persuasion meek, Bathe in the lucid tear on Beauty's cheek; Have mark'd thee in the downcast eye, When suff'ring Virtue claim'd the pitying sigh. Oft, by thy thrilling voice subdued, The meagre fiend Ingratitude Her treach'rous fang conceals; Pale Envy hides her forked sting; And Calumny beneath the wing Of dark oblivion steals. Before thy pure and lambent fire Shall frozen Apathy expire; Thy influence, warm and unconfin'd, Shall rapt'rous transports give, And in the base and torpid mind Shall bid the fine Affections live. When Jealousy's malignant dart Strikes at the fondly-throbbing heart; When fancied woes on every side assail, Thy honey'd accents shall prevail; When burning Passion withers up the brain, And the fix'd lids the glowing drops sustain, Touch'd by thy voice, the melting eye Shall pour the balm of yielding Sympathy. 'Tis thine with lenient Song to move The dumb despair of hopeless Love; Or when the animated soul On Fancy's wing shall soar, And, scorning Reason's soft control, Untrodden paths explore, Till, by distracting conflicts tost, The intellectual source is lost; E'en then, the witching music of thy tongue, Stealing thro' Mis'ry's darkest gloom, Weaves the fine threads of Fancy's loom, Till every slacken'd nerve, new strung, Bids renovated Nature shine, Amidst thy fost'ring beams, oh! Eloquence divine! ODE TO THE MOON. Pale Goddess of the witching hour! Blest Contemplation's placid friend! Oft in my solitary bow'r I mark thy lucid beam From thy crystal car descend, Whitening the spangled heath and limpid sapphire stream. And oft amidst the shades of night I court thy undulating light; When Fairies dance around the verdant ring, Or, sportive, frisk beside the bubbling spring; When the thoughtless Shepherd's song Echoes thro' the silent air, While he pens his fleecy care, Or plods with saunt'ring gait the dewy meads along. Chaste Orb! as thro' the vaulted sky Feath'ry clouds transparent sail; When thy languid, weeping eye Sheds its soft tears upon the painted vale; As sad I ponder o'er the rising floods, Or tread with listless step th' embow'ring woods, O let thy soft, though transitory beam, Soothe my sad mind with Fancy's aëry dream. Wrapt in Reflection, let me trace, Around the vast ethereal space, Stars, whose twinkling fires illume Dark-brow'd Night's obtrusive gloom: Where, across the concave wide, Flaming Meteors swiftly glide; Or, along the milky way, Vapours shoot a silvery ray; And as I mark thy faint reclining head, Sinking on Ocean's glassy bed, Let Reason tell my soul, thus all things fade: The Seasons change, the gaudy Sun, When Day's burning car hath run Its fiery course, no more we view, While o'er the mountain's golden head, Streak'd with tints of crimson hue, Twilight's filmy curtains spread, Stealing o'er Nature's face, a desolating shade. Yon musky Flow'r, that scents the earth; The Sod, that gave its odours birth; The Rock, that breaks the torrent's force; The Vale, that owns its wand'ring course; The woodlands, where the vocal throng Trill the wild melodious song; Thirsty deserts, sands that glow, Mountains, capp'd with flaky snow; Luxuriant groves, enamell'd fields, All that prolific nature yields, Alike shall end; the sensate Heart, With all its passions, all its fire, Touch'd by Fate's unerring dart, Shall feel its vital strength expire; Those eyes, that beam with Friendship's ray, And glance ineffable delight, Shall shrink from Life's translucid day, And close their fainting orbs in Death's impervious night. Then what remains for mortal pow'r, But Time's dull journey to beguile; To deck with joy the winged hour, To meet its sorrows with a patient smile; And when the toilsome pilgrimage shall end, To greet the tyrant, as a welcome friend. ODE TO MEDITATION. Sweet Child of Reason! maid serene! With folded arms and pensive mien; Who, wand'ring near yon thorny wild, So oft my length'ning hours beguil'd; Thou who, within thy peaceful cell, Canst laugh at Life's tumultuous care, While calm repose delights to dwell On beds of fragrant roses there; Where meek-ey'd Patience waits to greet The woe-worn trav'ller's weary feet, Till by her blest and cheering ray The clouds of sorrow fade away; Where conscious Rectitude retires; Instructive Wisdom; calm Desires; Prolific Science—lab'ring Art; And Genius, with expanded heart. Far from thy lone and pure domain Steals pallid Guilt, whose scowling eye Marks the rack'd soul's convulsive pain, Tho' hid beneath the mask of joy; Madd'ning Ambition's dauntless band; Lean Avarice with iron hand; Hypocrisy with fawning tongue; Soft Flatt'ry with persuasive song; Appall'd, in gloomy shadows fly, From Meditation's piercing eye. How oft with thee I've stroll'd unseen O'er the lone valley's velvet green; And brush'd away the twilight dew That stain'd the cowslip's golden hue; Oft, as I ponder'd o'er the scene, Would mem'ry picture to my heart How full of grief my days have been, How swiftly rapt'rous hours depart! Then wouldst thou, sweetly reas'ning, say, “Time journeys thro' the roughest day.” The Hermit, from the world retir'd, By calm Religion's voice inspir'd, Tells how serenely time glides on, From crimson morn, till setting sun; How guiltless, pure, and free from strife, He journeys thro' the vale of Life; Within his breast nor sorrows mourn, Nor cares perplex, nor passions burn; No jealous fears, or boundless joys, The tenor of his mind destroys; And when revolving mem'ry shows The thorny world's unnumber'd woes, He blesses Heav'n's benign decree, That gave his days to Peace and Thee. The gentle Maid whose roseate bloom Fades fast within a cloister's gloom, Far by relentless Fate remov'd From all her youthful fancy lov'd— When her warm heart no longer bleeds, And cool Reflection's hour succeeds, Led by thy downy hand, she strays Along the green dell's tangled maze; Where thro' dank leaves the whisp'ring show'rs Awake to life the fainting flow'rs; Absorb'd by Thee, she hears no more The distant torrent's deaf'ning roar; The well-known Vesper's silver tone; The bleak wind's desolating moan; No more she sees the nodding spires, Where the lone bird of night retires, While Echo chants her boding song The cloister's mould'ring walls among; No more she weeps at Fate's decree, But yields her pensive soul to Thee. The Sage whose palsied head bends low 'Midst scatter'd locks of silv'ry snow, Still by his mind's clear lustre tells What warmth within his bosom dwells; How glows his heart with treasur'd lore, How rich in Wisdom's boundless store: In fading Life's protracted hour, He smiles at Death's terrific pow'r; He lifts his radiant eyes, which gleam With Resignation's sainted beam; And, as the weeping star of morn Sheds lustre on the wither'd thorn, His tear benign calm comfort throws O'er rugged Life's corroding woes; His pious soul's enlighten'd rays Dart forth, to gild his wint'ry days; He smiles serene at Heav'n's decree, And his last hour resigns to Thee. When Learning, with Promethean art Unveils to light the youthful heart; When on the richly-budding spray The glorious beams of Genius play; When the expanded leaves proclaim The promis'd fruits of rip'ning Fame; O Meditation, maid divine! Proud Reason owns the work is thine. Oft have I known thy magic pow'r Irradiate sorrow's wint'ry hour; Oft my full heart to Thee hath flown, And wept for mis'ries not its own; When shrewd hypocrisy has wound In dulcet tones my soul around, While art, conceal'd in specious guise, Pour'd passion's tear and pity's sighs; When, cold Ingratitude was seen Beneath affection's gentlest mien; When, pinch'd with agonizing Pain, My restless bosom dar'd complain; Oft have I sunk upon thy breast, And lull'd my weary mind to rest; Till I have own'd the blest decree, That gave my soul to Peace and Thee. ODE TO VALOUR. Transcendent Valour!—godlike Pow'r! Lord of the dauntless breast, and stedfast mien! Who, rob'd in majesty sublime, Sat in thy eagle-wafted car, And led the hardy sons of war, With head erect, and eye serene, Amidst the arrowy show'r; When, unsubdued, from clime to clime, Young Ammon taught exulting Fame O'er earth's vast space to sound the glories of thy name. Illustrious Valour! from whose glance Each recreant passion shrinks dismay'd; To whom benignant Heav'n consign'd All that can elevate the mind; 'Tis thine, in radiant worth array'd, To rear thy glitt'ring helmet high, And with intrepid front defy Stern Fate's uplifted arm and desolating lance. When, from the Chaos of primæval Night, This wondrous Orb first sprung to light, And, poiz'd amid the sphery clime By strong Attraction's pow'r sublime, Its whirling course began; With sacred spells encompass'd round, Each element observ'd its bound, Earth's solid base huge promontories bore; Curb'd Ocean roar'd, clasp'd by the rocky shore; And 'midst metallic fires translucent rivers ran. All nature own'd th' Omnipotent's command! Luxuriant blessings deck'd the vast domain; He bade the budding branch expand, And from the teeming ground call'd forth the cherish'd grain; Salubrious springs from flinty caverns drew; Enamell'd verdure o'er the landscape threw; He taught the scaly host to glide, Sportive, amidst the limpid tide; His breath sustain'd the Eagle's wing; With vocal sounds bade hills and valleys ring; Then, with his Word supreme, awoke to birth The human Form sublime! The Sov'reign Lord of Earth! Valour! thy pure and sacred flame Diffus'd its radiance o'er his mind; From Thee he learnt the fiery Steed to tame, And with a flow'ry band the speckled Pard to bind; Guarded by Heav'n's eternal shield, He taught each living thing to yield; Wond'ring yet undismay'd he stood To mark the Sun's fierce fires decay; Fearless he saw the tiger play, While at his stedfast gaze the Lion couch'd subdu'd. When, fading in the grasp of death, Illustrious Wolfe on earth's cold bosom lay; His anxious soldiers, thronging round, Bath'd with their tears each gushing wound; As on his pallid lip the fleeting breath In faint and broken accents stole away, Loud shouts of triumph fill'd the skies, To Heav'n he rais'd his grateful eyes, “'Tis Vict'ry's voice!” the hero cried, “I thank thee, bounteous Heav'n!” then smiling died! When erst on Calpe's rock stern victory stood, Hurling swift vengeance o'er the bounding flood, Each winged bolt illum'd a flame, Iberia's vaunting sons to tame, While o'er the foaming troubled deep The blasts of desolation flew, Fierce lightnings, hov'ring round the frowning steep, 'Midst the wild waves their fatal arrows threw; Loud roar'd the cannon's voice with ceaseless ire, While the vast bulwark glow'd a pyramid of fire! Then, in each Briton's gallant breast, Benignant Virtue shone confest! While death spread wide his direful reign, And shrieks of horror echo'd o'er the main, Eager they plung'd their sinking foes to save From the dread precincts of a whelming grave! Then Valour, was thy proudest hour! Then didst thou, like a radiant God, Check the stern rigours of th' avenging rod, And with soft mercy's hand subdue the scourge of power. ODE TO THE MEMORY OF MY LAMENTED FATHER, Who died in the service of the Empress of Russia, December 5, 1786. Oh! Sire rever'd! ador'd! Was it the solemn tongue of Death, That, whisp'ring to my pensive ear, Pronounc'd the fatal word Which bath'd my cheek with many a tear, And stopp'd, awhile, my gasping breath? “He toils no more! “Far on a foreign shore “His honour'd dust a laurel'd grave receives, “While his immortal soul in realms celestial lives!” Oh! my lov'd sire, farewell! Though we are doom'd on earth to meet no more, Still Mem'ry lives, and still I must deplore! And long this throbbing heart shall mourn, Though thou to these sad eyes wilt ne'er return! Yet shall remembrance dwell On all thy sorrows through life's stormy sea, When Fate's resistless whirlwinds shed Unnumber'd tempests round thy head, The varying ills of human destiny! Yet, with a soul sublimely brave, Didst thou endure the dashing wave; Still buffetting the billows rude, By all the shafts of woe undaunted, unsubdued! Through a long life of rugged care, 'Twas thine to steer a steady course! 'Twas thine Misfortune's frowns to bear, And stem the wayward torrent's force! And as thy persevering mind The toilsome path of Fame pursued, 'Twas thine, amidst its Flow'rs, to find The wily Snake—Ingratitude! Yet vainly did th' insidious reptile strive On thee its poisons dire to fling; Above its reach, thy laurel still shall thrive, Unconscious of the treach'rous sting! 'Twas thine to toil through length'ning years Where low'ring night absorbs the spheres! Thy warmly enterprising mind Nor fear, nor sordid hopes could bind; For bold ambition warm'd thy breast, And lured thee from inglorious rest, O'er icy seas to bend thy way, Where frozen Greenland rears its head, Where dusky vapours shroud the day, And wastes of flaky snow the stagnate Ocean spread! 'Twas thine, amidst the smoke of war, To view, unmov'd, grim-fronted Death; Where Fate, enthron'd in sulphur'd Car, Shrunk the pale legions with her scorching breath! While, all around her, bath'd in blood, Iberia's haughty sons plung'd lifeless 'midst the flood! Now, on the wings of Meditation borne, Let fond Remembrance turn, and turn to mourn: Slowly and sad, her length'ning pinions sweep, O'er the rough bosom of the boist'rous deep, To that disastrous, fatal coast, Where, on the foaming billows tost, Imperial Catharine's navies rode; And War's inviting banners wide Wav'd hostile o'er the glitt'ring tide That with exulting conquest glow'd! For there, oh Sorrow! check the tear! There, round departed Valour's bier, The sacred drops of kindred Virtue shone! Proud Monuments of Worth! whose base Fame on her starry hill shall place; There to endure, admir'd, sublime! E'en when the mould'ring wing of Time Shall scatter to the winds huge pyramids of stone! Oh! Gallant Soul! Farewell! Though doom'd this transient orb to leave, Thy Daughter's heart, whose grief no words can tell, Shall, in its throbbing centre, bid thee live! While from its crimson fount shall flow The silent tear of ling'ring grief; The gem sublime! that scorns relief, Nor vaunting shines with ostentatious woe! Tho' thou art vanish'd from these eyes, Still from thy sacred dust shall rise A Wreath that mocks the polish'd thought, The sculptur'd bust, the poet's praise, While Fame shall weeping guard the spot Where Valour's dauntless Son decays! Unseen to cherish Mem'ry's source divine, Oh! Parent of my life! shall still be mine! And thou shalt, from thy blissful state, Awhile avert thy raptur'd gaze, To own, that, 'midst this wild'ring maze, The Flame of filial Love survives the blast of Fate! ODE TO NIGHT. Dread child of Erebus! whose pow'r Sheds horror o'er the darken'd world; While ghosts, with winding-sheets unfurl'd, Welcome the murky hour! While conscience, like a coward base, Awakes to madd'ning fear; When not a breathing thing is near The records of the wounded mind to trace! Of thee I sing, in sable sadness drest, While happier mortals dream, and pain and sorrow rest. I hail thee now, while, o'er each glimmering star, Triumphant in thy viewless car, Thou sail'st across th' eternal dome, Scatt'ring around thee thick wove gloom. The whirling orb its course pursues; But oh! how mournfully obscure! Where are its lustres, and its hues, Its mountains, vales, and rivers pure? Envelop'd in the black obtrusive shade, Oblivion grasps the Scene, and all its beauties fade. Now, seated on thy Ebon Tow'r, Lord of the Solitary Hour! Thou spread'st thy raven pinions wide, Creation's vanquish'd charms to hide! And when the meek Moon's crystal eye Gleams on the sable forehead of the sky, Thou bidd'st each envious passing cloud Her beamy Crescent faintly shroud, That o'er the lurid space Thy million eyes may trace The den where haggard Guilt retires, To hold fierce converse with the demons fell, Link'd in thy fatal spell! And while each twinkling star expires, The wild winds shake the distant spheres, And Nature hides her face, bedew'd with chilling tears! Soul-penetrating Gloom! Thou strict examiner of human thought! When the bright Taper's brilliant ray, Through the long painted hall, and marble dome, Sheds artificial day; Thou com'st with all thy horrors fraught, To beckon forth the guilty soul, And bend each stubborn nerve to thy Supreme Control! Oh Night! thou Spectre bold! Thou parent of heart-chilling fear! Thou canst each hidden thought unfold; For Conscience will be heard when thou art near! And when the cheerful day And all its raptures fade away, The Tyrant shuns his blood-stain'd throne, Deck'd in the tinsel pageantry of show, And, on his regal couch, alone, Resigns his breast to silent woe: Ah! then, he traces back the hour, When, by Ambition led, Devoted legions bled, To lengthen a small span of transitory pow'r! Then fancy paints the poorest swain, That, on the bleak and barren plain, In his low Cottage sinks to rest, Celestial Peace the partner of his breast; Who, led by cheerful labour to repose, Finds his rude pillow strew'd with many a thornless Rose. Oh! horrid Night! Thou prying Monitor confest! Whose key unlocks the human breast, And bares each avenue to mental sight! When from the festive bow'r The frenzied Homicide retreats, And, in his bosom's cell, Essays each rising throb to quell; Thy penetrating pow'r His sense with many a Phantom greets; He rushes forth in wild amaze! While down his brow the big drop strays; Then, from thy mist opaque, Deep groans assail his startled ears, His limbs convuls'd with horror shake, And the short fev'rish Hour, Such is thy dreadful pow'r! An Age of agonizing woe appears; For Sleep the vengeful fiends deride, Till the blest Sun darts forth to bid thy reign subside! How glorious is the eastern sky! The warm tints rushing o'er the blue serene, O'er the tall mountain Morn's effulgent eye Diffuses wide the renovated scene! The silv'ry Dew-drops, scatter'd round, Spangle the variegated ground; Or dress the waving woods in glitt'ring pride, Or down the silky leaves in bright succession glide. Then the sultry Noon appears, Absorbing Nature's ling'ring tears; While o'er the Thyme-clad heath, Faint with its scorching breath, The Flocks and Herds to covert move; The sun-burnt Hind suspends his toil, And, plodding o'er the thirsty soil, Seeks the green sod and cool embow'ring grove; The murmuring river lulls his mind to rest, While the soft Southern breeze steals lightly o'er his breast! Now, pensive hour, Calm-bosom'd Evening, thee I hail! While o'er the perfum'd bow'r Thy balmy breathings gently sail; Meek handmaid of sublime repose, From whose calm eye the soft tear flows! As o'er the Landscape's glowing breast Thou fling'st thy purple vest; While in the Western spheres Day's streamy radiance slowly fades, Till, wrapp'd in dusky shades, The pale Horizon scarce appears; And as the melodies of Nature fail, The sullen beetle, humming near, Obtrudes upon thy pensive ear, That listens to the mournful Nightingale, The tangled dells and sparry rocks among, Where, to the rising moon, she pours her love-lorn song! Then dark-brow'd Night, thou com'st again, With all thy melancholy train; While Bats expand their leathern wings, And Owls forsake their ivy'd home, O'er the blank solitude to roam; And the small Cricket sings, Near the dim embers of the Cottage fire, To warn the village Maid with Omens sad and dire! Yet art thou not to my rapt breast A dread, unwelcome, startling guest; For when I quit the trifling throng, To me, O solitary Night! Thou bring'st the soothing calm delight, Which charms my pensive heart and wakes the Muse's song! ODE TO HOPE. Fly, dark Despondency! away! Parent of Frenzy and Despair! Go, seek the lurid haunts of Care, Nor here thy haggard form display! I hate thy ever scowling eye; Thy icy hand; thy rending sigh; Thy slow congealing, sullen tear; Thy listless pace; thy wither'd breast, That owns no distant gleam of rest, No promis'd tranquil hour, thy Soul's deep night to cheer! But come, fair Hope, heart-soothing maid! Come, with thy beaming eye the gloom pervade. Smiling harbinger of pleasure! Here unfold thy promis'd treasure! At thy approach the weedy Bow'r Blooms with many an op'ning Flow'r; The Skies with brighter azure glow; The Streams in clearer windings flow; The Birds new melodies essay; Luxuriant Foliage bends the Spray; While all the glories of earth, sea, and sky, Proclaim, celestial Hope, that thou art nigh! Now on my couch, where o'er my Mind Dull-ey'd Despondency reclin'd, Fair blossoms shoot! rich fragrance teems, To prompt young Fancy's rapt'rous dreams; While at my feet Lethean waters glide; Eternal Silence Priestess of the tide! Where Feeling, meek and trembling guest, Bathes in the magic stream her wounded breast, Care's deadly venom to destroy, Till, every pang forgot, she hails approaching Joy. Now banish'd from Elysian vales and groves, Despondency with moody Madness roves! Or sits upon the craggy mountain steep, Whose dizzy edge hangs shadowing o'er the deep: The lightning's glare displays her form; And while the deaf'ning whirlwinds blow, She views, unmov'd, the rising storm, That shatters the devoted Bark below! The Sea-birds scream! the billows rise! The loud-ton'd thunder rends the skies! The warring elements conspire To taunt her breast with furious ire! She seems their direst rage to brave, Till, rising from the yawning wave, Despair appears, the Spirit of the Deep! The whelming surge her flaming pinions sweep; The howling winds with louder clamours roar; The angry billows lash the rocky shore; While livid lightnings, flashing death around, Quench their blue arrows in the gulph profound! Hark! how the flinty fabric shakes! While pale Despondency awakes! And, rising from her hanging seat, Darts forth Despair to meet. The with'ring victim seems to glide Along the cliff's tremendous side; Now, by her dark associate borne, Awhile she seems to weep and mourn; Then, lock'd within her cold embrace, Sinks 'midst the horrors of unfathom'd space! Now, the dreary tempest o'er, Madd'ning horror reigns no more; On the eastern summit bright, Day unbars the gates of light; And rushing forward, rob'd in crimson fire, Bids sombre night with all her train retire! The sev'ring clouds dissolving fly; The soft breeze fans the glitt'ring main; The lucid rill runs babbling o'er the plain, Its crystal breast reflects the glowing sky! Hope comes in heavenly colours drest; Her golden pinions cool my breast; Her eye with sparkling lustre shines; Her hand a beauteous chaplet twines; And marking Fame's fair temple in the skies, Bids for my grateful brow a budding laurel rise! ODE TO HUMANITY. Written during the Massacres at Paris, in September, 1792. Offspring of Heav'n! from whose bland throne Thou bend'st with salutary wing, Bearing the olive branch divine, To grace Britannia's lucid zone; Where in calm majestic pride Her conqu'ring Navies proudly ride! While Art and Commerce smiling join, And to the fav'ring skies exulting Pæans ring! Oh! bend thy flight from pole to pole; With balmy pinions swiftly sweep O'er the dark and foaming deep, Where the warring billows roll; Where, in shadowy vestments clad, Ghastly Visions, pale and sad, Rising from their prison-wave, Seem their destiny to brave; Destiny severe and dire, That spurn'd each tender hope away, Each social gleam of mortal Day, And gave their dauntless souls to War's insatiate Ire! Now their dismal chorus sounds E'en to earth's remotest bounds! “Beware!” it says; “mankind, beware! “Sheath the sword of Death, nor wage “War with Heav'n's impending rage; “Nor rouse the furious Fiend Despair! “Already see, by Fate unfurl'd, “His poison'd banner shades the world; “All around him sad appears, “Stain'd with Gore or drench'd in Tears; “Where'er the Monster bends his eye, “Beneath the fatal glance devoted millions die.” O blest Humanity! 'tis thine To shed consoling balm divine Wide o'er the groaning race beneath; And when fell Slaughter lifts her wreath, Let the Laurel bough appear, Gemm'd with Pity's holy tear; Let it moisten every bud, Glowing, hot with human blood! And when no crimson tint remains, When no foul blush its lustre stains, Bathe with oblivious balm the dread record, Grav'd on the page of Fame by Gallia's vengeful sword! Mark, oh! mark the tented plains Where exulting Discord reigns; Flush'd with rage, her panting breast, Her eye with ruthless lightnings stor'd, She lifts her never-failing sword, With wreaths of with'ring Laurel drest. By her side, in proud array, Ambition stalks, with restless soul; Madd'ning Vengeance leads the way; Her giant crest disdains control; Triumphantly she waves her iron hand, While her red Pinions sweep the desolated Land! See! beneath her murd'rous wing, Howling Famine seems to cling! Feeding on the putrid breeze, Her wither'd Heart begins to freeze! With sullen eye she scowls around, O'er the barren hostile ground; Where once the golden Harvest wav'd; Where the clust'ring Vineyard rose, By many a lucid streamlet lav'd; Now the purple Torrent flows! She marks the direful change with curses deep, While, o'er the scene forlorn, distracted legions weep! Where the tow'ring City stands, Once a polish'd Nation's pride, See stern Death, with rapid stride, Leads on his grisly bands! The Infant's shriek, the Sire's despair, Rend the sulphur-stagnant air! Nought illumes the thick'ning shade, Save the Poignard's glitt'ring blade; All along the flinty way, Streams of blood are seen to stray, Foaming, blushing, as they flow, While ev'ry dome resounds with agonizing woe! Haste, Humanity! prepare Chains to quell the fiend Despair; Round pale Vengeance swiftly twine; Discord bind in spells divine! Now where Famine droops her head, Reason's balmy banquet spread; And where the blood-stain'd Laurel dies, Oh! let the Olive bloom, the Fav'rite of the Skies! ODE TO THE HARP OF LOUISA. If aught could soothe to peace the wounded breast, Or round its throbbing pulses twine; If aught could charm despair to rest, Sweet Harp, the wondrous pow'r was thine! For, oh! in many a varying strain, Thy magic lull'd the direst pain, While from each thought to human ills allied, 'Twas thine to steal the soul, and bid its fears subside! O source of joy, for ever flown! While yet the tear bedews my cheek, Let the fond Muse thy graces speak, Thy thrilling chords, thy silver tone, That, as the western breezes sweep, Soft murm'ring o'er the troubled deep, Could calm Affliction's tempest rude, Till ev'ry thought was bliss, and ev'ry pang subdu'd. Now let the Muse a wreath prepare, A mournful wreath, alas! to bind Thy strings forlorn; The primrose pale, the lily fair. But where shall I a blossom find Like her I mourn? Where seek a Rose with native colours drest? Ah! beauteous flow'r! No more thy charms confess'd Shall with their sweetness decorate my bow'r; For vain, soft emblem, is thy glowing pride, Since on Louisa's cheek the blush of Beauty died. Sweet sainted shade! for ever flown To worlds unknown, Oh! let me decorate thy bier With many a spotless flow'r! The Cypress bath'd with Pity's tear, Shall consecrated incense show'r! There shall the budding Laurel bloom, The Myrtle too shall grace thy tomb; For Genius own'd thy attributes divine, And Beauty, short-liv'd boast, sweet Maid, was thine! But who shall of thy gentle manners speak, The grac'd complacency that deck'd thy mind! The fine affections, tender, warm, yet meek, Luxuriant taste, with modesty combin'd! Oh! she was passing good, and passing fair! Blest with a soul so exquisitely even; A gem so polish'd, so supremely rare, So free from folly, and so form'd for Heav'n! Too pure, too excellent for mortal eyes, She like a vision shone, then vanish'd to the skies! Dear blushing Rose! Lost object of our tender woes! Three ling'ring days, thy leaves to shed, The fateful blast howl'd o'er thy drooping head; For Time, reluctant to destroy So rich a source of treasur'd joy, Fann'd with his wing the tyrant's breath; But, ah! how chilling is the frost of Death! Too weak the conflict to endure, Time saw thee, lovely, sweet, and pure, In all thy wondrous charms array'd, Shrink from the with'ring storm, and meekly fade! In Nature's variegated bow'r, How many pois'nous weeds appear, Shedding their desolating pow'r On ev'ry gentle blossom near; But, oh! how rarely do we find, Amidst the gay diversity of sweets, Where ev'ry charm the fancy greets, Such faultless attributes combin'd! Sure, Nature form'd thee, matchless Maid, to show How far her pow'r—her wondrous pow'r would go! When o'er the world black Midnight steals, And ev'ry eye in temporary death Exhausted Nature kindly seals; When on the confines of the grave no breath Assails cold Meditation's ear, Friendship shall clasp thy urn, and drop a silent tear! There Resignation, pensive, sad, Shall plant around the buds of spring; And Innocence, in snowy vestment clad, The dews of Heav'n shall scatter from her wing! And there shall weeping virgins throng, And there Religion's holy song In soft vibration's round the shrine shall die, To emulate on earth the minstrels of the sky! Oft when the rosy beams of day Shall on the eastern summit glow, I'll listen to the Lark's shrill lay; And as the mellow warblings flow, O Harp forlorn! I'll think of thee, and own How poor the matin song, how weak the mimic tone! Oft, in slow and mournful measure, Melting woe thy chords express'd; Oft to blithe ecstatic pleasure Thrilling strains awoke the breast; If thy gentle mistress smil'd, How thy glitt'ring strings would glow! While, in transports brightly wild, Mingling melodies would flow! Then, swifter than the wings of thought, The song, with heav'nly pity fraught, Would die away in magic tone, Sweet as the Ring-dove's plaintive moan; Soft as the breeze at closing day, That sighs to quit the parting ray; Or, on ethereal pinions borne, Upon the perfum'd breath of morn, Sails o'er the mountain's golden crest, To fan Aurora's burning breast! Yet, envy'd Harp! no praise was thine; 'Twas by Louisa's pow'r alone Thy meek, melodious, melting tone Could round the captive senses twine! 'Twas hers rebellious passions to control, While ev'ry chord bespoke the peerless Minstrel's soul! Yet was the Fame that crown'd thy worth The wonder of a transient day; Nor could it snatch from cold decay The beauteous hand that gave it birth; For excellence like hers was lent, not giv'n, To shew Mortality a glimpse of Heav'n! Sweet blooming flow'r! Scarce seen ere lost, Nipp'd by a cruel frost! Oh! what an Age of promis'd joy, Relentless Death, didst thou destroy In one short Hour! But who shall dare repine? Who blame Omnipotence divine? The pure ethereal soul Sprang from its prison-clay, impatient of control; For this polluted orb too fine, It plung'd the gulph of Fate in happier realms to shine! For in this sad and stormy world, Perchance, by many a tempest hurl'd, The gentle Spirit had endur'd Ills that only Death had cur'd! Or liv'd no ray of bliss to see, A Mine of treasure, in a troubled Sea! Yet Mem'ry, watchful of her Fame, Shall guard it with a sacred zeal; And oft in mournful numbers claim The Pang she knew so well to feel! For sorrow ne'er assail'd her ear Unanswer'd by a pitying tear; Her bosom glow'd with Virtue's conscious flame; And where she could not praise, she scorn'd to blame! Oft by the cunning of her skilful hand Attention hung enamour'd o'er thy strain; For well she could the soul command, And cheat long-cherish'd Mis'ry of its pain, Till, by her soothing harmony beguil'd, Pale Melancholy rais'd her languid eye, and smil'd! Lull'd by the slow and dulcet sound, E'en Madness could forget to weep, And, bound in galling chains, serenely sleep On the bare ground! From thy celestial tone would Anger fly; While Envy, sick'ning with despair, Though born the keenest pangs to bear, Would with her shaggy locks o'ershade her scowling eye! To tame the savage bosom well she knew! What cannot magic Melody subdue? Yet was the Maid unconscious of her sway; While, far from public scenes remov'd, The calm and studious hour she lov'd, And through the path of life pursu'd her thornless way; Or when adorn'd with all the pride of praise, She bloom'd a blushing Rose, amidst a wreath of Bays! Oh Harp rever'd! if round each silent string The deathless wreath of Fame should fondly twine, 'Tis not for thee th' admiring Muse shall sing, But for the tuneful Maid who woke thy sounds divine! Then rest, in torpid silence rest; Mute be thy chords, and mute the Muse's song; Louisa joins an heavenly throng, And chants the Pæans of the blest! There, far remov'd from human Woe, Amidst the sainted Choir her Strains immortal flow! TO THE MUSE OF POETRY. “But, ah! beware how thou shalt fling “Thy hot pulse o'er the quiv'ring string, “How thou another's name shall raise, “How gild another with thy praise!” ARMIDA TO RINALDO. ORACLE, Jan. 5th, 1791. Exult, my Muse! exult to see Each envious, waspish, jealous thing Around its harmless venom fling, And dart its powerless fangs at Thee! Ne'er shalt Thou bend thy radiant wing To sweep the dark revengeful string; Or meanly stoop to steal a ray, E'en from Rinaldo's glorious lay, Tho' his transcendent Verse should twine About thy heart each bliss divine. O Muse ador'd! I woo thee now From yon bright Heaven to hear my vow; From thy blest wing a plume I'll steal, And with its burning point record Each firm indissoluble word, And with my lips the proud oath seal! I swear!—O ye whose soul like mine Beams with poetic rays divine, Attend my voice;—whate'er my Fate In this precarious wild'ring state, Whether the Fiends, with rancorous ire, Strike at my heart's unsullied fire, While busy Envy's recreant guile Calls from my cheek the pitying smile Or jealous Slander, mean and vain, Essays my mind's best boast to stain; Should all combine to check my lays, And tear me from thy fost'ring gaze, Ne'er will I quit thy burning eye, 'Till my last, eager, gasping sigh Shall, from its earthly mansion flown, Embrace thee on thy starry Throne Sweet soother of the pensive breast! Come, in thy softest splendours dress'd; Bring with thee Reason, chastely mild, And classic Taste—her loveliest child; And radiant Fancy's offspring bright; Then bid them all their charms unite, My mind's wild rapture to inspire With thy own sacred, genuine Fire. I ask no fierce terrific strain, That rends the breast with tort'ring pain; No frantic flight, no labour'd art, To wring the fibres of the heart! No frenzy'd Guide, that madd'ning flies O'er cloud-wrapp'd hills—thro' burning skies; That sails upon the midnight blast, Or, on the howling wild wave cast, Plucks from their dark and rocky bed The yelling Demons of the deep, Who, soaring o'er the Comet's head, The bosom of the welkin sweep! Ne'er shall my hand, at Night's full noon, Snatch from the tresses of the moon A sparkling crown of silv'ry hue, Besprent with studs of frozen dew, To deck my brow with borrow'd rays, That feebly imitate the Sun's rich blaze. Ah lead me not, dear gentle Maid, To poison'd bow'r or haunted glade; Where beck'ning spectres shrieking glare Along the black infected air; While bold “fantastic thunders” leap, Indignant, 'midst the clam'rous deep, As envious of its louder tone, While lightnings shoot, and mountains groan With close pent fires, that from their base Hurl them amidst the whelming space; Where Ocean's yawning throat resounds, And, gorg'd with draughts of foamy ire, Madly o'erleaps its crystal bounds, And soars to quench the Sun's proud fire. While Nature's self shall start aghast, Amid the desolating blast, That grasps the sturdy Oak's firm breast, And, tearing off its shatter'd vest, Presents its gnarled bosom, bare, To the hot lightning's with'ring glare! Transcendent Muse! assert thy right; Chase from thy pure Parnassian height Each bold usurper of thy Lyre, Each phantom of phosphoric fire, That dares, with wild fantastic flight The timid child of Genius fright; That dares with pilfer'd glories shine Along the dazzling frenzy'd line, Where tinsel splendours cheat the mind, While Reason, trembling far behind, Drops from her blushing front thy Bays, And scorns to share the wreath of praise. But when divine Rinaldo flings Soft rapture o'er the bounding strings; When the bright flame that fills his soul Bursts thro' the flame of calm control, And on enthusiastic wings To Heaven's Eternal Mansion springs, Or, darting thro' the yielding skies, O'er earth's disastrous valley flies; Forbear his glorious flight to bind; Yet o'er his true poetic Mind Expand thy chaste celestial ray, Nor let fantastic fires diffuse Deluding lustre round his muse, To lead her glorious steps astray! Ah! let his matchless harp prolong The thrilling Tone, the classic song; Still bind his Brow with deathless Bays, Still grant his Verse—a Nation's Praise. But if, by false persuasion led, His varying Fancy e'er should tread The paths of vitiated Taste, Where folly spreads a “weedy waste;” Oh! may he feel no more the genuine fire That warms his tuneful Soul and prompts thy sacred Lyre. TO THE BLUE BELL. Blue Bell! how gayly art thou drest, How neat and trim art thou, sweet flow'r; How silky is thy azure vest, How fresh, to flaunt at morning's hour! Couldst thou but think, I well might say Thou art as proud in rich array As lady blithesome, young and vain, Prank'd up with folly and disdain, Vaunting her pow'r, Sweet flow'r! Blue Bell! O! couldst thou but behold Beside thee where a rival reigns, All deck'd in robe of glossy gold, With speckled crown of ruby stains! Couldst thou but see this cowslip gay, Thou wouldst with envy faint, and say, Hence from my sight, plebeian vain, Nor hope, on this my green domain, For equal pow'r, Bold flow'r! Poor rivals! could ye but look round, On yonder hillock you would see The Nettle, with its stings to wound, The Hemlock, fraught with destiny. On them the sun its morning beam Pours in as rich, as proud a stream As on the fairest rose that rears Its blushing brow 'midst nature's tears, Chilling its pow'r, Faint flow'r. Then why dispute this wide domain, Since nature knows no partial care, The nipping blast, the pelting rain, Both will with equal ruin share. Then what is vain distinction, say, But the short blaze of Summer's day? And what is pomp or beauty's boast? An empty shadow, seen and lost! Such is thy pow'r— Vain flow'r! NEGLECT. Ah! cold neglect! more chilling far Than Zembla's blast or Scythia's snow; Sure born beneath a luckless star Is he who, after ev'ry pain Has wrung his bosom's tend'rest vein, To fill his bitter cup of woe, Is destin'd thee to know. The smiles of fame, the pride of truth, All that can lift the glowing mind, The noblest energies of youth, Wit, Valour, Genius, Science, taste! A form by all that's lovely grac'd, A soul where virtue dwells enshrin'd, A prey to thee we find! The spring of life looks fresh and gay, The flow'rs of fancy bud around, We think that ev'ry morn is May; While Hope and rapture fill the breast, We hold reflection's loss a jest, Nor own that sorrow's shaft can wound, Till cold neglect is found. Ah! then, how sad the world appears, How false, how idle are the gay! Morn only breaks to witness tears, And ev'ning closes but to shew That darkness mimics human woe, And life's best dream a summer day That shines and fades away. Some dread disease and others' woe! Some visionary torments see; Some shrink unpitied love to know, Some writhe beneath oppression's fangs, And some with jealous, hopeless pangs; But whatsoe'er my fate may be, O! keep neglect from me! E'en after death let Mem'ry's hand, Directed by the moonlight ray, Weave o'er my grave a cypress band, And bind the sod with curious care, And scatter flow'rets fresh and fair, And oft the sacred tribute pay, To keep Neglect away! ODE TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER, On her Birth-Day, October 18, 1794. 'Tis not an April-day, Nor rosy Summer's burning hour, Nor Ev'ning's sinking ray, That gilds rich Autumn's yellow bow'r, Alone, that fades away! Life is a variegated, tedious span, A sad and toilsome road, the weary trav'ller, Man! 'Tis not the base alone That wander through a desert drear, Where Sorrow's plaintive tone Calls Echo from her cell to hear The soul-subduing moan; In haunts where Virtue lives retir'd we see The agonizing wounds of hopeless Misery! 'Tis not in titles vain, Or yet in costly trappings rare, Or Courts where Monarchs reign, Or Sceptre, Crown, or regal Chair, To quell the throb of pain; The balmy hour of rest alone, we find, Springs from that sacred source, Integrity of Mind! Pow'r cannot give us health, Or lengthen out our breathing day! Nor all the stores of wealth The sting of conscience chase away! Time seals each charm by stealth, And, spite of all that Wisdom can devise, Still to the vale of Death our dreary pathway lies! Mark how the Seasons go! Spring passes by in liveliest green, Then Summer's trappings glow, Then Autumn's tawny vest is seen, Then Winter's locks of snow! With true Philosophy each change explore, Read Nature's page divine! and mock the Pedant's lore. Life's race prepar'd to run, We wake to Youth's exulting glee; Alas! how soon 'tis done! We fall, like blossoms from the tree, Yet ripe, by Reason's sun; The cherish'd fruit in Winter's gloom shall be An earnest bright and fair—of Immortality! Sweet comfort of my days! While yet in Youth's ecstatic prime, Illum'd by Virtue's rays, Thy hand shall snatch from passing Time A wreath that ne'er decays! That when cold age shall shrink from worldly cares, A Crown of conscious Peace may deck thy silver hairs! We are but busy Ants, We toil through Summer's vivid glow To hoard for Winter's wants; Our brightest prospects fraught with woe, And thorny all our haunts! Then let it be the Child of Wisdom's plan, To make his little hour as cheerful as he can! The Being we adore Bids all the face of Nature smile! The wisest can no more Than view it, and revere the while! Then let us not explore Things hidden in the mysteries of Fate; Man should rely on Heav'n, nor murmur at his state! Thou art more dear to me Than sight, or sense, or vital air! For ev'ry day I see Presents thee with a mind more fair! Rich pearl, in life's rude Sea! Oh! may thy mental graces still impart The balm that soothes to rest a Mother's trembling heart! Still may revolving years Expand the virtues of thy mind! And may Affliction's tears Thy peaceful pillow never find; Nor fruitless hopes—nor fears: May no keen pangs thy halcyon bow'r invade, But ev'ry thought be bliss, till thy last hour shall fade! ODE TO WINTER. Hail! Tyrant of the gloomy season, hail! I greet thine hoary brow and visage pale: I greet thy grey and solemn eye, Thy bosom deathly cold, Thy breath, that breathes to petrify, Thy snowy crest, which thick'ning clouds enfold! Parent of Desolation! numbing pow'r! Nature first heard thee in the stormy hour; And, on the bleak hill's shaggy side, Beheld thee on the howling whirlwind ride: While, with'ring in the wild blast keen, Her beauteous progeny were seen, Woods, meadows, flow'rets gay, and velvet hillocks green. She heard thy voice, both loud and deep, The loftiest mountains sweep, Echoing their cavern'd haunts among, With cadence fiercely strong. She mark'd thy sable robe, wide spread Upon the tall cliff's barren head: Blank solitudes of dazzling snow Display thy drear domain; And, in the peopled hamlets of the plain, Intolerable Despot! shiv'ring Woe And pale-ey'd Famine mark'd thy pow'r, Lord of the freezing hour! Rivers, whose clamour spread around, 'Mid Summer's glow, a pleasing sound; Moaning, or rippling slow along, Embroider'd banks among— Woods, that, nodding o'er the steep, The misty summits crown, And, while the ev'ning breezes sleep, Wave to the setting Sun their branches brown— The shallow brooks, that, when soft May Shew'd her flush'd bosom, flow'd so fast, Now mute in icy fetters stay, And motionless endure the blast— All, to thy fierce and desolating sway, Yield, scowling Despot of the short-liv'd day! Within the cottage, low and mean, Pale Poverty's chill'd group is seen; Tho' not far off, across the plain, The senseless and luxurious train Of Pomp and Folly revel, gay, The festive hours away! The plenteous board, the blazing fire, The jest and vacant smile; The cheering cup, the warm attire, The freezing nights beguile. Unheard by pleasure's train, the North wind blows, They sink on beds of down, to sweet and long repose. O petrifying Pow'r! They little heed the darkest hour; For, while with Fortune's favours blest, With days of luxury and nights of rest, Pride scarce remembers Mis'ry's shrinking Kind, Who freeze beneath the cutting wind; Who on the snowy desert stray, Or plough the wild and wat'ry way; Who, doom'd no dawning hour of Hope to see, Linger thro' length'ning days, or, Tyrant, yield to thee! HORATIAN ODE. Say, when the captive bosom feels A magic spell around it wove, While o'er the cheek the soft blush steals; Say, is it Love? With pensive mien and devious pace, To seek the dark embow'ring grove; The pale moon's quiv'ring beams to trace; Say, is it Love? When, chain'd to one dear lonely spot, The bosom feels no wish to rove, All other scenes of bliss forgot; Say, is it Love? To tremble, while o'er Fancy's eye A thousand dreadful visions move; To hope, to fear, to weep, to sigh; Say, is it Love? To seek occasions, false and weak, The darling object to reprove; To look, what language fails to speak! Say, is it Love? To chide for ev'ry trivial crime; To bid him from your rage remove; To guide with Hope the wings of Time; Say, is it Love? To know no cheerful morn of rest; No balmy hour of sleep to prove; To hold Philosophy a jest! Say, is it Love? To cherish grief, nor dare complain; To envy sainted souls above; While jealous anguish rends the brain; Say, is it Love? Long have I, doom'd, alas! to grieve, Against the fell enchantment strove; Then, Fate, ah! let me “cease to live, or cease to love!” ODE FOR THE 18th OF JANUARY, 1794. The Muse who pours the votive strain, Weeps o'er each tributary line, And grieves to know that conscious pain, Perverts her glorious great design. Alas! in vain of joys she sings, While Pity shackles Rapture's wings, And meek Dejection's trickling tear Responsive flows to sighs sincere; While Meditation, fraught with rending woes, To ev'ry feeling mind a scene of misery shews. Bleak blows the petrifying gale Upon the Peasant's rushy roof! His breast a thousand pangs assail, As though his heart were tempest-proof! His shiv'ring infants round him mourn, And cry “Ah! when will spring return?” “Do all, like us, distress endure! “So cold, so hungry, and so poor?” Yet when their day is past stern fate bestows The balmy hour of rest, which greatness seldom knows. No more, Reflection, sorrowing maid, O'er reason cast thy awful veil; Where mirth, in careless garb array'd, And smiles, and thoughtless jests prevail. For shouldst thou trace, with pensive mien, The fatal agonizing scene Where legions wade through human gore! And death shoots swift from shore to shore! The splendid glare of revelry would fade, And all its phantoms sink in sorrow's whelming shade. For fancy might, perchance, descry The woe which pleasure's tribe ne'er saw, The bleeding breast! the phrenzied eye! That chill the soul with fearful awe! Fancy might paint th' embattled plain, The shrieking wife, the breathless swain, The blazing cot, the houseless child, Driv'n on Misfortune's rugged wild! And truth might whisper to the pond'ring mind, “Such is the chequer'd lot of half the human kind!” Ye threat'ning storms malignant, fly! Cloud not this fair, this festive day; Burst forth to splendour, low'ring sky, And flash around a vivid ray. Swiftly come, whispering zephyrs, chase The tears that bathe Reflection's face! Bid mournful Memory cease to gaze On livelier scenes of peaceful days, When ev'ry morning breeze, that found our isle, Awoke her hardy sons to labour and to smile. Now let the gaudy tribe advance, Let only present joys be known, And let blithe beauty's lightning-glance Dart lustre round Britannia's throne. Yet, if amidst the dazzling sight A sparkling tear of liquid light, Drawn by a sigh from pity's breast, Should fall, to gem the regal crest! O! may it shine with Heav'n's approving blaze, An attribute divine, to mock inferior rays! Come, soft-ey'd Hope! in spotless vest, Come, and our brows with olive deck! Bathe with thy balm the human breast, And rear new charms on nature's wreck; Bid drooping Commerce thrive again; Spread rapture o'er the rustic plain; Wash with the spring from mercy's eye The blood that bids the laurel die! And spread once more around this favour'd isle The fost'ring rays of Peace! and bid fair freedom smile. TO PEACE: FROM THE “SHRINE OF BERTHA,” A NOVEL, BY MISS ROBINSON. O Peace! thou nymph of modest mien! Where, where, dost thou delight to stray? Dost thou o'er mountains bend thy way, When ev'ning spreads its shade serene? Or dost thou fly from scorching light, To seek the tufted vale? Or, 'midst the solemn noon of night, List to the love-lorn minstrel's tale? Or in the Hermit's solitary cell, In simple vestment clad, with holy Silence dwell? Fair, first-born, placid child of Jove! An humble suppliant deign to hear; If, from thy starry-spangled sphere, Thou stoop'st o'er mortal scenes to rove; If ever to the lonely shed Of agony and grief Thy slow and timid footsteps tread, To bring the balm of sure relief; Oh! quickly come, and through each aching vein Thy sainted balsam pour, to lull my fev'rish brain. The vain, the busy world I scorn; I seek no gaudy scenes of guile, Where falsehood courts with murd'rous smile, And pleasure mocks the wretch forlorn: To unillumin'd caves I'll fly, Or climb the mountain's crest; And, hid from ev'ry curious eye, Steal softly to thy halcyon breast; Where soothing visions round my form shall move, And one long tranquil dream my weary senses prove! Already from my throbbing heart The killing shaft of anguish flies; Hope sparkles in my grateful eyes, And reason blunts affliction's dart! About my waist no myrtle weaves; No rose adorns my brow; Nor yet the poppy's numbing leaves; Nor yet the laurel's pompous bough; Then, Peace! thy healing olive let me own, And let me steal thro' life—unenvied and unknown. ODE IN IMITATION OF POPE. How blest is he who, born to tread The silent paths of sweet repose, Finds peace beneath the rural shed, Which pomp—ne'er knows. Who roves, with independent mind, O'er hills, and meads, and flow'ry plains, That feast on nature's lap to find Which pride—disdains! How blest to sing, and talk, and smile, The busy envious world forgot, To fear no lurking stings of guile, In his low cot. When high the matin lark is seen, With flutt'ring wings and shrilly song, He saunters o'er the dewy green, Fearless of wrong. And when the sultry sun flames high, He seeks the silent shade or dell, No fierce banditti lurking nigh, With murd'rous spell As ev'ning's crimson shadows fade, And twilight spreads its mantle grey, He plods along the upland glade, Serenely gay! Then on some pallet clean and low, He sleeps, nor dreams of ills the while, And when the eastern mountains glow, He wakes—to smile. He shuns the pride of wealth and birth— No vassal's lord—no tyrant's slave! His hut, the haunt of modest worth, The turf—his grave. TO APATHY. Welcome, thou petrifying pow'r! Come, fix on me thy vacant eye, Which never on thy frozen breast (Insensate throne of torpid rest) Dropp'd the soft tear of sympathy, In pity's graceful show'r.— Whose heart ne'er throbb'd with pleasure or with pain, Melted with fond regret or glow'd with proud disdain. Dull Maid! to thee my willing vows I pay, Thou whom nor fortune nor caprice can change; With thee I'll waste the undelighted day, With thee, unmindful of all nature, range: The sun-deck'd mountain or the murm'ring main, The bleak hill's summit, winter's frozen plain, Appear alike, O Apathy! to thee: Then welcome, numbing pow'r! my idol thou shalt be. Thy poppy wreath shall bind my brows, Dead'ning the sense of pain; And while to thee I pay my vows, A chilling tide shall steal thro' every vein, Pervade my heart, and ev'ry care beguile, While my wan cheek shall bear thy ever vapid smile. Amidst the vast expanse of scene Which mem'ry traces, still my mind Shall rest, O Apathy! serene, Patient, content, resign'd! When fancy paints the past repose, Which taught my weary eyes On luxury's smooth couch to close, And bad me with the cheerful morn to rise, No tear shall steal my soft regret to shew, No sigh shall swell my breast, for ev'ry woe Shall find its balm—dear Apathy, in thee! Thou best and potent cure for human misery! Happy are those who, taught by thee, Behold with tranquil mind The changes of their destiny, The sombre and the rosy hours, And still with opiate flow'rs Their icy bosoms bind! To them, the wreath of friendship torn Presents no agonizing thorn; Ingratitude its fangs in vain Upon my heart may bear, For, dead to ev'ry touch of pain, Thine adamantine shield is there! Sustain'd by thee, the breast of stone Bounds not with sympathetic grace, Nor stoops the weedy path to trace, Where mis'ry's children groan! Pale sickness lifts the languid eye, To see thee pass unpitying by, While poverty's gaunt sons, in silent pride, Steal to some lonely spot obscure, And, nobly organized, deride Those ills which patient virtue cannot cure. When love his tyrant pow'r would prove, Thou, vapid dreamer, still to thee My darksome pilgrimage shall be, Thro' forest drear and unfrequented grove; Heedless, my footsteps still shall go O'er flow'ry meads or wilds of snow; The burning beams of noon shall fall On my scorch'd breast—unheeded all; The cold moon, gleaming mild and pale, Shall o'er the woody mountains sail, Or quiver on the swelling sea, Unmark'd by me! For I, by Apathy possess'd, Shall taste one dream of solitary rest, One dark unvaried dream—till fate Shall from this busy wild'ring state My spell-encircled soul set free— Ending thy short-liv'd pow'r, congealing Apathy. ODE TO THE SUN-BEAM. Thou dazzling beam of fervid light! Thy long and potent reign, With sultry tyranny and arrow bright, Now desolates the plain! The with'ring herbage shrinks from thee; Thou burn'st with ruthless fire the tree; The daisied heath is yellow'd o'er— And dewy fragrance greets the sense no more. Emblem of worldly joy! I see Life's grandest scenes epitomiz'd by thee! Gaudy and pleasing; but awhile;— And then how sick'ning they appear— How dark! how drear! For when the bright hours cease to smile, How lone the midnight gloom steals by! And, Oh! how chilling is the beamless sky! So worldly sorrow comes, when splendour fades— A blank of solitude, a barren waste of shades! BEAUTY's GRAVE. Unhappy has the traveller been Who, where the languid flow'rets wave, The glitt'ring tears of morn has seen On beauty's grave! Who, when the scorching hour of day Its fiercest lustre bade him brave, Has shudder'd near the icy clay Of beauty's grave! Who, when the tempest yell'd afar, Has heard the sighing zephyrs wave, As slowly rose the ev'ning star, On beauty's grave! Lorn is the wand'rer who beholds Near the swift brook's unwearied wave, The grass-green mantle that enfolds Beauty's low grave! And sad, when twilight's shadows close, To hear the wild affections rave Around the bed of still repose, Pale beauty's grave! There, while the faint moon rises high, The Parent mourns, who could not save, Yet sees his hope, his treasures lie In beauty's grave! Yet on that turf the sweetest flow'rs, With daisies, ruby-ey'd, shall wave, And Spring shall shed its softest show'rs, On beauty's grave! LINES TO THE MEMORY OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN. “Fate snatch'd him early to the pitying sky.” —POPE. If Worth, too early to the grave consign'd, Can claim the pitying tear or touch the mind; If manly sentiments, unstain'd by art, Could waken Friendship or delight the heart; Ill-fated youth! to thee the Muse shall pay The last sad tribute of a mournful lay; On thy lone grave shall May's soft dews be shed, And fairest flow'rets blossom o'er thy head; The drooping lily, and the snow-drop pale, Mingling their fragrant leaves, shall there recline, While Cherubs, hov'ring on th' ethereal gale, Shall chant a requiem o'er the hallow'd shrine. And if Reflection's piercing eye should scan The trivial frailties of imperfect Man; If in thy generous heart those passions dwelt Which all should own, and all that live have felt; Yet was thy polish'd mind so pure, so brave, The young admir'd thee, and the old forgave. And when stern Fate, with ruthless rancour, press'd Thy withering graces to her flinty breast, Bright Justice darted from her bless'd abode, And bore thy Virtues to the throne of God; While cold Oblivion, stealing o'er thy mind, Each youthful folly to the grave consign'd. O! if thy purer spirit deigns to know Each thought that passes in this vale of woe, Accept the incense of a tender tear, By Pity wafted on a sigh sincere. And if the weeping Muse a wreath could give To grace thy tomb and bid thy Virtues live, Then Wealth should blush the gilded mask to wear, And Avarice shrink, the victim of Despair; While Genius, bending o'er thy sable bier, Should mourn her darling Son with many a tear, While in her pensive form the world should view The only Parent that thy sorrows knew. ODE INSCRIBED TO THE INFANT SON OF S. T. COLERIDGE, Esq. Born Sept. 14, 1800, at Keswick, in Cumberland. Spirit of Light! whose eye unfolds The vast expanse of Nature's plan! And from thy eastern throne beholds The mazy paths of the lorn traveller—Man! To thee I sing! Spirit of Light, to thee Attune the varying strain of wood-wild minstrelsy! O Pow'r Creative!—but for Thee Eternal Chaos all things would enfold; And black as Erebus this system be, In its ethereal space—benighted—roll'd. But for thy influence, e'en this day Would slowly, sadly, pass away; Nor proudly mark the Mother's tear of joy, The smile seraphic of the baby boy, The Father's eyes, in fondest transport taught To beam with tender hope—to speak the enraptur'd thought. To thee I sing, Spirit of Light! to thee Attune the strain of wood-wild minstrelsy. Thou sail'st o'er Skiddaw's heights sublime, Swift borne upon the wings of joyous time! The sunny train, with widening sweep, Rolls blazing down the misty-mantled steep; And far and wide its rosy ray Flushes the dewy-silver'd breast of day! Hope-fost'ring day! which nature bade impart Heav'n's proudest rapture to the parent's heart. Day! first ordain'd to see the baby prest Close to its beauteous mother's throbbing breast; While instinct, in its laughing eyes, foretold The mind susceptible—the spirit bold— The lofty soul—the virtues prompt to trace The wrongs that haunt mankind o'er life's tem pestuous space. Romantic mountains! from whose brows sublime Imagination might to frenzy turn! Or to the starry worlds in fancy climb, Scorning this low earth's solitary bourn— Bold Cataracts! on whose headlong tide The midnight whirlwinds howling ride— Calm-bosom'd Lakes! that trembling hail The cold breath of the morning gale; And on your lucid mirrors wide display, In colours rich, in dewy lustre gay, Mountains and woodlands, as the dappled dawn Flings its soft pearl-drops on the summer lawn; Or paly moonlight, rising slow, While o'er the hills the ev'ning zephyrs blow:— Ye all shall lend your wonders—all combine To bless the baby boy with harmonies divine. O baby! when thy unchain'd tongue Shall, lisping, speak thy fond surprise; When the rich strain thy father sung, Shall from thy imitative accents rise; When thro' thy soul rapt Fancy shall diffuse The mightier magic of his loftier Muse; Thy waken'd spirit, wond'ring, shall behold Thy native mountains, capp'd with streamy gold! Thy native Lakes, their cloud-topp'd hills among, O! hills! made sacred by thy parent's song! Then shall thy soul, legitimate, expand, And the proud lyre quick throb at thy command! And Wisdom, ever watchful, o'er thee smile, His white locks waving to the blast the while; And pensive Reason, pointing to the sky, Bright as the morning star her clear broad eye, Unfold the page of Nature's book sublime, The lore of ev'ry age—the boast of ev'ry clime! Sweet baby boy! accept a Stranger's song; An untaught Minstrel joys to sing of thee! And, all alone, her forest haunts among, Courts the wild tone of mazy harmony! A Stranger's song! babe of the mountain wild, Greets thee as Inspiration's darling child! O! may the fine-wrought spirit of thy sire Awake thy soul and breathe upon thy lyre! And blest, amid thy mountain haunts sublime, Be all thy days, thy rosy infant days, And may the never-tiring steps of time Press lightly on with thee o'er life's disastrous maze. Ye hills, coeval with the birth of time! Bleak summits, link'd in chains of rosy light! O may your wonders many a year invite Your native son the breezy path to climb; Where, in majestic pride of solitude, Silent and grand, the hermit thought shall trace, Far o'er the wild infinity of space, The sombre horrors of the waving wood; The misty glen; the river's winding way; The last deep blush of summer's ling'ring day; The winter storm, that, roaming unconfin'd, Sails on the broad wings of the impetuous wind. O! whether on the breezy height Where Skiddaw greets the dawn of light, Ere the rude sons of labour homage pay To Summer's flaming eye or Winter's banner grey; Whether Lodore its silver torrent flings— The mingling wonders of a thousand springs! Whether smooth Basenthwaite, at Eve's still hour, Reflects the young moon's crescent pale; Or meditation seeks her silent bow'r, Amid the rocks of lonely Borrowdale. Still may thy name survive, sweet Boy! till Time Shall bend to Keswic's vale—thy Skiddaw's brow sublime! TO THE POET COLERIDGE. Rapt in the visionary theme! Spirit Divine! with thee I'll wander, Where the blue, wavy, lucid stream, 'Mid forest glooms, shall slow meander! With thee I'll trace the circling bounds Of thy new Paradise extended; And listen to the varying sounds Of winds, and foamy torrents blended. Now by the source which lab'ring heaves The mystic fountain, bubbling, panting, While Gossamer its net-work weaves, Adown the blue lawn slanting! I'll mark thy sunny dome, and view Thy Caves of Ice, thy fields of dew! Thy ever-blooming mead, whose flow'r Waves to the cold breath of the moonlight hour! Or when the day-star, peering bright On the grey wing of parting night; While more than vegetating pow'r Throbs grateful to the burning hour, As summer's whisper'd sighs unfold Her million, million buds of gold; Then will I climb the breezy bounds, Of thy new paradise extended, And listen to the distant sounds Of winds, and foamy torrents blended! Spirit divine! with thee I'll trace Imagination's boundless space! With thee, beneath thy sunny dome, I'll listen to the minstrel's lay, Hymning the gradual close of day; In Caves of Ice enchanted roam, Where on the glitt'ring entrance plays The moon's-beam with its silv'ry rays; Or, when glassy stream, That thro' the deep dell flows, Flashes the noon's hot beam; The noon's hot beam, that midway shows Thy flaming Temple, studded o'er With all Peruvia's lustrous store! There will I trace the circling bounds Of thy new paradise extended! And listen to the awful sounds, Of winds, and foamy torrents blended! And now I'll pause to catch the moan Of distant breezes, cavern-pent; Now, ere the twilight tints are flown, Purpling the landscape, far and wide, On the dark promontory's side I'll gather wild flow'rs, dew besprent, And weave a crown for thee, Genius of Heav'n-taught poesy! While, op'ning to my wond'ring eyes, Thou bidst a new creation rise, I'll raptur'd trace the circling bounds Of thy rich paradise extended, And listen to the varying sounds Of winds, and foaming torrents blended. And now, with lofty tones inviting, Thy nymph, her dulcimer swift smiting, Shall wake me in ecstatic measures! Far, far remov'd from mortal pleasures! In cadence rich, in cadence strong, Proving the wondrous witcheries of song! I hear her voice! thy sunny dome, Thy caves of ice, loud repeat, Vibrations, madd'ning sweet, Calling the visionary wand'rer home. She sings of thee, O favour'd child Of Minstrelsy, sublimely wild! Of thee, whose soul can feel the tone Which gives to airy dreams a magic all thy own! SAPPHO. LINES TO THE REV. J. WHITEHOUSE. On receiving a copy of his Odes lately published, from the author. In this dread era! when the Muse's train Shrink from the horrors of th' embattled plain; When all that Grecian elegance could boast, 'Midst the loud thunders of the scene, is lost! As one vast flame, with force electric hurl'd, Grasps the rous'd legions of th' enlighten'd world; The Bard, neglected, droops upon his lyre, And all the thrills of poesy expire!— Save where the melting melody of verse Steals in slow murmurs round the soldier's hearse, While o'er the rugged sod that shields his clay Soft pity chants the consecrated lay! For, ah! no more can Fancy's livelier art Light the dim eye or animate the heart; Can all the tones that harmony e'er knew The sigh suppress, the gushing tear subdue! No charm she owns the bleeding breast to bind, The breast that palpitates for human kind. Thus did reflection o'er each wounded sense Pour the strong tide of reason's eloquence! As, 'midst the scene of desolating woe, She mark'd, aghast! the purple torrent's flow! Man against man opposed, with furious rage, To blur with kindred gore life's little stage; While high above the thick'ning legions stood Dark-brow'd Revenge! bath'd in a nation's blood. 'Twas then persuasive Friendship's soothing pow'r Bade Fancy greet thee in thy classic bow'r! There, from the thorny maze of ills retir'd, I found the Muse! and all the Muse admir'd! Fair wreaths of amaranth, a boundless store; Truth's golden page, and wisdom's treasur'd lore; Description's pencil, dipp'd in rainbow dyes; And Genius, first-born offspring of the skies, The harp inspir'd! the ever varying song; Correct, though wild, and elegant, though strong! There Albion's Muse, in Grecian beauty drest, At once could awe and vivify the breast; In mingling cadence tune the sacred yielding wire, To soothe, instruct, to soften or inspire! First, the Enthusiast's energy she prov'd, As o'er the chords her glowing fingers mov'd! The witching wildness through each fibre stole, And seiz'd on all the faculties of soul! Then fierce Ambition smote the wond'ring string, In strains that bid the azure concave ring; The deaf'ning crash awoke the nations round, And millions trembled at the mighty sound! Next, o'er the wond'ring throng impetuous War, The lord of slaughter, roll'd his brazen car! A flaming brand the red-eyed monster held, And waved it high in air, and madly yell'd! While Horror, bath'd in agonizing dew, Before his rattling wheels distracted flew; Down his gaunt breast fast stream'd the scalding tear, And now he groan'd aloud, now shrunk with fear; His humid front was crown'd with bristling hair, His glance was frenzy, and his voice, despair! Then follow'd Beauty, in whose beaming eye Sat sainted Truth, coeval with the sky! Her song dispens'd ecstatic pleasure round, The soft lyre throbbing to the dulcet sound! Then elfin tribes in mazy groups advanc'd, Flaunted their gaudy trim, and nimbly danc'd! Tun'd their shrill voices to the tinkling string, Or lit with glow-worm's eyes the grassy ring; With wanton glee their moonlight gambols kept, And dealt the witching spell where mortals slept. Such is the pow'r of Fancy! such the skill That forms her varying shadows to the will! To crown her altar, which old time has chose Where silver Cam in silent grandeur flows; And many a turret, many a lofty spire, Marks where pindaric Gray attun'd his lyre! Still shall enamour'd Genius haunt the shrine, The Muses' triumph, and their smiles—be thine. Yet think not, Bard inspir'd! that o'er the wreath Thy hand has form'd no poison'd blast shall breathe; Tho' blossoms fair in mingling colours vie, Bright, but not transient, as the rainbow's die! Envy will penetrate thy halcyon bow'r, And crush with hurried step each rising flow'r; Or tasteless rage, with voice infuriate, wild, Bid malice triumph where the graces smil'd. For oft, where high the tree of Genius springs, The pale fiend hovers with her mildew wings; Shades the rich foliage from the fost'ring ray, And marks each leaf for premature decay; Dims the warm glow that decorates the fruit, And strikes her lightning-glances to the root; Strips the rent fragments of each latent bloom, Nor leaves one branch to deck the POET'S tomb! Such is the fate of Genius! yet when art So sweet as thine can elevate the heart; Though Envy's eye, or hate's remorseless rage, May strive to dim the philosophic page; Tho' war's hot breath may blast the wreath of fame; Immortal time shall consecrate thy name. TO THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE. The Nightingale with mourning lay, Amid the twilight's purpling glow, May sweetly hymn the loss of day, While echo chants her melting woe; But what can soothe the wounded breast, And ev'ry aching sense beguile— Ah! what can charm the soul to rest, Like Devon's voice or Devon's smile? The modest orb, with trembling light, Beams thro' the soft and fresh'ning show'r, And, stealing o'er the realm of night, Gives lustre to the silent hour; But what can cheer the fainting heart, When gloomy horror frowns severe— Ah! what can sympathy impart, Like Devon's sigh or Devon's tear? Tho' nature's proudest will combin'd To give her form unequall'd grace; And though the feelings of her mind With fine expression mark her face; Yet as the Casket charms the view But till the treasur'd gem is seen, Her mind demands the tribute due, Which else her beauty's claim had been. If there be magic in her tear, And if her smile can bliss impart, Her sigh is still to feeling dear, And well her voice can soothe the heart; Then where shall wond'ring fancy dwell, Nor own exclusive pow'r the while; O! say which holds the strongest spell, Her voice, her sigh, her tear, or smile? LINES INSCRIBED TO P. DE LOUTHERBOURG, Esq. R. A. On seeing his Views in Switzerland, &amp;c. &amp;c. Where on the bosom of the foamy Rhine In curling waves the rapid waters shine; Where tow'ring cliffs in awful grandeur rise, And 'midst the blue expanse embrace the skies; The wond'ring eye beholds yon craggy height, Ting'd with the glow of Evening's fading light, Where the fierce cataract, swelling o'er its bound, Bursts from its source and dares the depth profound. On ev'ry side the headlong currents flow, Scatt'ring their foam like silv'ry sands below: From hill to hill responsive echoes sound, Loud torrents roar, and dashing waves rebound; Th' opposing rock the azure stream divides, The white froth tumbling down its sparry sides; From fall to fall the glitt'ring channels flow, Till, lost, they mingle in the lake below. Tremendous spot! amid thy views sublime, The mental sight ethereal realms may climb, With wonder rapt the mighty work explore, Confess th' Eternal's pow'r! and pensively adore. All-varying Nature! oft the outstretch'd eye Marks o'er the Welkin's brow the meteor fly; Marks where the Comet with impetuous force O'er Heaven's wide concave skims its fiery course: While on the Alpine steep thin vapours rise, Float on the blast—or freeze amidst the skies; Or, half congeal'd, in flaky fragments glide Along the gelid mountain's breezy side; Or, mingling with the waste of yielding snow, From the vast height in various currents flow. Now pale-ey'd Morning, at thy soft command, O'er the rich landscape spreads her dewy hand; Swift o'er the plain the lucid rivers fly, Imperfect mirrors of the dappled sky: On the fring'd margin of the dimpling tide, Each od'rous bud, by Flora's pencil dy'd, Expands its velvet leaves of lustrous hue, Bath'd in the essence of celestial dew; While from the Meteor to the simplest Flow'r, Prolific Nature! we behold thy pow'r! Yet has mysterious Heaven with care consign'd Thy noblest triumphs to the human mind; Man feels the proud pre-eminence impart Intrepid firmness to his swelling heart: Creation's lord! where'er he bends his way, The torch of Reason spreads its godlike ray. As o'er Sicilian sands the Trav'ller roves, Feeds on its fruits and shelters in its groves, Sudden amidst the calm retreat he hears The pealing thunders in the distant spheres; He sees the curling fumes from Etna rise, Shade the green vale and blacken all the skies: Around his head the forked lightnings glare, The vivid streams illume the stagnant air; The nodding hills hang low'ring o'er the deep, The howling winds the clust'ring vineyards sweep; The cavern'd rocks terrific tremors rend, Low to the earth the tawny forests bend; While He, an Atom in the direful scene, Views the wild Chaos, wond'ring and serene; Tho' at his feet sulphureous rivers roll, No touch of terror shakes his conscious soul; His Mind, enlighten'd by Promethean rays, Expanding, glows with intellectual blaze! Such scenes long since th' immortal Poet charm'd, His Muse enraptur'd and his Fancy warm'd: From them he learnt with magic eye t' explore The dire Arcanum of the Stygian shore! Where the departed spirit, trembling, hurl'd “With restless violence round the pendent world,” On the swift wings of whistling whirlwinds flung, Plung'd in the wave or on the mountain hung. While o'er yon cliff the ling'ring fires of day In ruby shadows faintly glide away, The glassy source that feeds the Cataract's stream Bears the last image of the solar beam; Wide o'er the landscape nature's tints disclose The softest picture of sublime repose; The sober beauties of Eve's hour serene, The scatter'd village, now but dimly seen; The neighb'ring rock, whose flinty brow, inclin'd, Shields the clay cottage from the northern wind: The variegated woodlands scarce we view, The distant mountains ting'd with purple hue; Pale twilight flings her mantle o'er the skies, From the still lake the misty vapours rise; Cold show'rs, descending on the western breeze, Sprinkle with lucid drops the bending trees, Whose spreading branches, o'er the glade reclin'd, Wave their dank leaves and murmur to the wind. Such scenes, O Loutherbourg, thy pencil fir'd, Warm'd thy great mind, and every touch inspir'd: Beneath thy hand the varying colours glow, Vast mountains rise, and crystal rivers flow: Thy wondrous Genius owns no pedant rule, Nature's thy guide, and Nature's works thy school: Pursue her steps, each rival's art defy, For while she charms thy Name shall never die. ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF GARRICK. Dear Shade of Him who grac'd the mimic scene, And charm'd attention with resistless pow'r! Whose wondrous art, whose fascinating mien, Gave glowing rapture to the short-liv'd hour! Accept the mournful verse, the ling'ring sigh, The tear that faithful Mem'ry stays to shed; The sacred Tear, that from Reflection's eye Drops on the ashes of the sainted dead. Lov'd by the grave and courted by the young, In social comforts eminently blest; All hearts rever'd the precepts of thy tongue, And Envy's self thy eloquence confess'd. Who could like thee the soul's wild tumults paint, Or wake the torpid ear with lenient art? Touch the nice sense with pity's dulcet plaint, Or soothe the sorrows of the breaking heart? Who can forget thy penetrating eye, The sweet bewitching smile, th' empassion'd look? The clear deep whisper, the persuasive sigh, The feeling tear that Nature's language spoke? Rich in each treasure bounteous Heaven could lend, For private worth distinguish'd and approv'd— The pride of Wisdom—Virtue's darling friend— By Mansfield honour'd, and by Camden lov'd. The courtier's cringe, the flatt'rer's abject smile, The subtle arts of well-dissembled praise, Thy soul abhorr'd;—above the gloss of guile, Truth led thy steps, and Friendship crown'd thy days. Oft in thy Hampton's dark embow'ring shade The Poet's hand shall sweep the trembling string; While the proud tribute to thy mem'ry paid The voice of Genius on the gale shall fling. Yes, Sheridan! thy soft melodious verse Still vibrates on a nation's polish'd ear; Fondly it hover'd o'er the sable hearse, Hush'd the loud plaint, and triumph'd in a tear. In life united by congenial minds, Dear to the Muse, to sacred friendship true; Around her darling's urn a wreath she binds, A deathless wreath—immortaliz'd by you! Dear to a nation, grateful to thy muse, That nation's tears upon thy grave shall flow, For who the gentle tribute can refuse Which thy fine feeling gave to fancied woe? Thou who, by many an anxious toilsome hour, Reap'd the bright harvest of luxuriant Fame, Who snatch'd from dark oblivion's barb'rous pow'r The radiant glories of a Shakspeare's name! Remembrance oft shall paint the mournful scene Where the slow fun'ral spread its length'ning gloom, Where the deep murmur and dejected mien In artless sorrow linger'd round thy tomb. And tho' no laurel'd bust or labour'd line Shall bid the passing stranger stay to weep, Thy Shakspeare's hand shall point the hallow'd shrine, And Britain's genius with thy ashes sleep. Then rest in peace, O ever sacred shade! Your kindred souls exulting Fame shall join; And the same wreath thy hand for Shakspeare made, Gemm'd with her tears, about thy grave shall twine. MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF CHATTERTON. Chill penury repress'd his noble rage, And froze the genial current of his soul. —Gray. If Grief can deprecate the wrath of Heaven, Or human frailty hope to be forgiven! Ere now thy sainted spirit bends its way To the bland regions of celestial day; Ere now, thy soul, immers'd in purest air, Smiles at the triumphs of supreme Despair; Or, bath'd in seas of endless bliss, disdains The vengeful memory of mortal pains; Yet shall the Muse a fond memorial give, To shield thy name, and bid thy Genius live. Too proud for pity and too poor for praise, No voice to cherish and no hand to raise; Torn, stung, and sated, with this “mortal coil,” This weary, anxious scene of fruitless toil; Not all the graces that to youth belong, Nor all the energies of sacred song; Nor all that Fancy, all that Genius gave, Could snatch thy wounded spirit from the grave. Hard was thy lot, from every comfort torn; In Poverty's cold arms condemn'd to mourn; To live by mental toil, e'en when the brain Could scarce its trembling faculties sustain; To mark the dreary minutes slowly creep, Each day to labour and each night to weep; Till the last murmur of thy frantic soul In proud concealment from its mansion stole, While Envy, springing from her lurid cave, Snatch'd the young Laurels from thy rugged grave. So the pale primrose, sweetest bud of May, Scarce wakes to beauty ere it feels decay; While baleful weeds their hidden poisons pour, Choke the green sod and wither every flow'r. Immur'd in shades, from busy scenes remov'd, No sound to solace—but the verse he lov'd; No soothing numbers harmoniz'd his ear; No feeling bosom gave his griefs a tear; Obscurely born—no gen'rous friend he found To lead his trembling steps o'er classic ground; No patron fill'd his heart with flatt'ring hope, No tutor'd lesson gave his genius scope; Yet, while poetic ardour nerv'd each thought, And Reason sanction'd what Ambition taught, He soar'd beyond the narrow spells that bind The slow perceptions of the vulgar mind; The fire once kindled by the breath of Fame, Her restless pinions fann'd the glitt'ring flame; Warm'd by its rays, he thought each vision just; For conscious Virtue seldom feels distrust. Frail are the charms delusive Fancy shows, And short the bliss her fickle smile bestows; Yet the bright prospect pleas'd his dazzled view, Each Hope seem'd ripen'd, and each Phantom true; Fill'd with delight, his unsuspecting mind Weigh'd not the grov'lling treach'ries of mankind; For while a niggard boon his wants supplied, And Nature's claims subdu'd the voice of Pride, His timid talents own'd a borrow'd name, And gain'd by Fiction what was due to Fame. With secret labour, and with taste refin'd, This son of mis'ry form'd his infant mind! When op'ning Reason's earliest scenes began, The dawn of childhood mark'd the future man! He scorn'd the puerile sports of vulgar boys, His little heart aspir'd to nobler joys; Creative Fancy wing'd his few short hours, While soothing Hope adorn'd his path with flow'rs; Yet Fame's recording hand no trophy gave, Save the sad Tear—to decorate his grave. Yet in this dark, mysterious scene of woe, Conviction's flame shall shed a radiant glow; His infant Muse shall bind with nerves of fire The sacrilegious hand that stabs its sire. Methinks I hear his wand'ring shade complain, While mournful Echo lingers on the strain; Thro' the lone aisle his restless spirit calls, His phantom glides along the minster's walls; Where many an hour his devious footsteps trod, Ere Fate resign'd him to his pitying God. Yet shall the Muse, to gentlest sorrow prone, Adopt his cause, and make his griefs her own; Ne'er shall her Chatterton's neglected name Fade in inglorious dreams of doubtful fame. Shall he whose pen immortal Genius gave Sleep unlamented in an unknown grave? No—the fond Muse shall spurn the base neglect, The verse she cherish'd she shall still protect. And if unpitied pangs the mind can move, Or graceful numbers warm the heart to love; If the fine raptures of poetic fire Delight to vibrate on the trembling lyre; If sorrow claims the kind embalming tear, Or worth oppress'd excites a pang sincere— Some kindred soul shall pour the song sublime, And with the cypress bough the laurel twine, Whose weeping leaves the wint'ry blast shall wave In mournful murmurs o'er thy unbless'd grave. And though no lofty Vase or sculptur'd Bust Bends o'er the sod that hides thy sacred dust; Tho' no long line of ancestry betrays The pride of relatives, or pomp of praise; Tho' o'er thy name a blushing nation rears Oblivion's wing—to hide Reflection's tears! Still shall thy verse in dazzling lustre live, And claim a brighter wreath than Wealth can give. ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF WERTER. Written in Germany, in the year 1786. With female Fairies will thy tomb be haunted, And worms will not come to thee. Shakespeare. When from day's closing eye the lucid tears Fall lightly on the bending lily's head; When o'er the blushing sky night's curtains spread, And the tall mountain's summit scarce appears; When languid evening, sinking to repose, Her filmy mantle o'er the landscape throws; Of Thee I'll sing; and as the mournful song Glides in slow numbers the dark woods among, My wand'ring steps shall seek the lonely shade Where all thy virtues, all thy griefs are laid! Yes, hopeless suff'rer, friendless and forlorn, Sweet victim of love's pow'r! the silent tear Shall oft at twilight's close and glimm'ring morn Gem the pale primrose that adorns thy bier; And as the balmy dew ascends to heaven, Thy crime shall steal away, thy frailty be forgiv'n. Oft by the moon's wan beam the love-lorn maid, Led by soft Sympathy, shall stroll along; Oft shall she listen in the Lime-tree's shade, Her cold blood freezing at the night-owl's song; Or, when she hears the death-bell's solemn sound, Her light steps echoing o'er the hollow ground, Oft shall the trickling tear adorn her cheek, Thy pow'r, O Sensibility! in magic charms to speak! For the poor Pilgrim, doom'd afar to roam From the dear comforts of his native home, A glitt'ring star puts forth a silv'ry ray, Soothes his sad heart, and marks his tedious way; The short-liv'd radiance cheers the gloom of night, And decks Heav'n's murky dome with transitory light. So from the mournful Charlotte's dark-orb'd lids The sainted tear of pitying Virtue flows; And, the last boon the “churlish priest” forbids, On thy lone grave the sacred drop bestows; There shall the sparkling dews of evening shine, And Heav'n's own incense consecrate the Shrine.

Enter the Marquis Valmont and Prince Montalva. Valmont. It shall be so! Think not, my honour'd liege, That after a long life of busy toil My reason can be sway'd by a weak girl: From the first dawn of helpless infancy, I've taught her mild obedience to my will, And count upon her duty more than love. Montalva. I know her fix'd aversion to my son. Valmont. So weak a thought will not disturb my hopes. Firm to my purpose, tho' the heav'ns should yawn, And hurl their red bolts on my aged head, I would not waver! For your son has worth That makes his high descent his second claim! This day, in single combat, he shall prove The bravest youth that Lombardy e'er saw. Montalva. The sacred friendship that has link'd our minds, From the warm sunny hour of lusty youth To the chill winter of declining age, First turned my fancy towards the fair Honoria! Yet, rather than by sorrow's icy touch To bend so sweet a blossom to the grave, I would renounce my hopes, and her, for ever. Enter Duke Albert. Albert to Valmont. I greet you, noble Sir; and in your looks Behold the herald of my future joy. Montalva. Alas! my son, fate frowns upon thy hopes; The fair Honoria, rich Italia's star ? Albert. Say, what of her? Is there from nature's hand So rare a model of transcendent worth? The brilliant Hesperus that leads the day Is not so cheering to the Pilgrim's sight As she to mine! Montalva. Now, Albert, hear me speak: When last I saw her, on the tender theme, I mark'd on her pale cheek a trickling drop The silent herald of approaching woe! Albert. O! 'tis the pure and fascinating gem That nature gives to maiden modesty, To make her work more lovely! Does not the flow'r Most court the sense when deck'd with morning's tears? Montalva. And wouldst thou blast the sweet, the drooping bud? Come, like a nipping, an untimely frost, And wither all its beauties to the dust? My son, I will not think so basely of thee; A noble nature cannot taste of joy That leaves another bankrupt and forlorn. Albert. I know that love can take all forms to please; And think not that I nurse too vain a fancy, If I dare hope Honoria will be mine! A blush of meek complacency o'erspread The snow of her pure bosom, when I told My tale of tender import! Thus we mark The lily, blended in a garland sweet, Flush'd with the soft reflection of the rose! Valmont. And do we fear to feast our raptured sense, Lest we may find conceal'd a wounding thorn? But see, she comes! The insolent disdain That sits imperious on her haughty brow Be it thy task to combat and subdue. Enter Honoria. This day, Honoria, must decide thy fate; Thou art Duke Albert's bride, or not my daughter. Honoria. Indeed! I think this mandate somewhat cruel! Relentless pow'r may drag me to the altar; But the free soul shrinks from the tyrant's grasp And lords it o'er oppression! Valmont. Silence, rash girl! Again I urge, and with a father's right, A proud alliance with the noble Albert. Honoria. Perish his name! for it is hateful to me. O! I had rather be the poorest wretch That on the barren mountain stands forlorn, An exile from his kindred and his home, Than barter honesty for empty shew! Those who for paltry gold would part with peace At best can prove themselves but thrifty fools. Valmont, grasping Honoria's hand. Take heed, ungrateful girl, and mark me well; The soul of Valmont cannot brook denial. Honoria. ? By yon azure dome That flings its wondrous concave o'er the world, I will encounter poverty or death Rather than sell my freedom! This proud heart Would burst with indignation, could my tongue Pronounce a vow degrading to its honour! Does the vain suitor arrogantly hope To buy me like a slave? Valmont. Think on the splendours that await thy will. Honoria. Can the gay wreaths that bind a victim's breast Conceal the agony that throbs within? Give to the child of folly toys for fools; My soul disdains them! I am Valmont's daughter; Nor will I e'er disgrace my noble name By being less than what that title makes me! Valmont. I would augment the lustre of thy days, Place thee amidst such dazzling rays of glory, That ev'ry eye should wonder to behold thee! Honoria. So the fierce flame of a meridian sun Gilds the poor insect which it dooms to death! Valmont. Perverse destroyer of a father's hopes! And dar'st thou disobey, when I command? Honoria. I dare not sell my soul! Valmont. Go, self-will'd fool! Thy disobedience covers me with shame! Oh! had thy mother liv'd, her gentle heart Had throbb'd with anguish at thy wayward scorn; 'Tis for thy honour I this union urge, What else can prompt me?— Honoria. Ambition!—not that emulative zeal Which wings the tow'ring souls of godlike men! But bold, oppressive, self-created pow'r, That, trampling o'er the barrier of the laws, And scattering wide the tender shoots of pity, Strikes at the root of reason, and confines Nature itself in bondage! Oh! 'tis vile! But, thank the Gods! no spells can curb the mind, While splendour's proudest claim is less than virtue! Montalva. Honoria, spare thy anguish and thy scorn; And know, that ere the glories of my name Should dimly gleam beneath a tear of thine I would behold them perish; curs'd be those Who, to advance their own ambitious hopes, Would trample on the rights of truth and nature! [Trumpets without. My son, that summons chides thy tardy lance! I will attend thee, boy. Valmont, farewell. [Exeunt Montalva and Albert. Honoria. Who is the cautious hero that accepts The vaunting challenge of the haughty Albert? Valmont. I dare not tell; for 'tis the stranger's wish That none should seek to know his rank or name. From Sicily he comes, and nobly born; Right well he wields the lance, and is most apt In feats of chivalry and bold exploit! Honoria. From Sicily! my soul is chill'd with fear! [Aside. Sir, I attend your will, and proud shall be To witness Albert's valour! for believe, Altho' I cannot love, I can be just; Nor will the hero's youthful laurels fade Because they twine not with the myrtle bough. [Exeunt. SCENE II. [Opens, and discovers a spacious court in the palace of the prince Montalva, splendidly decorated for a tournament. Various spectators seated on rising benches; on one side a canopy, beneath which are seated, Honoria, (attended by Agnes) the prince Montalva (with Albert standing near him) and the Marquis Valmont. On the opposite side of the stage stand three knights in armour, each wearing a scarf and helmet of the same colour as the standard borne by his page, who waits near him: Alferenzi stands at some distance, nearer the wing than the other knights, with his page also. STANDARDS. 1st. Yellow, with a burning mountain. 2nd. Green, with a wreath of flowers and fruits. 3rd. Composed of silver waves, plain. Alferenzi's standard. White, with the motto, Virtue is Nobility. His scarf white with gold fringe. As the curtain rises to soft music, children strew flowers and laurels. Then follow warlike trophies to martial music. When the stage is arranged, Albert descends from the steps of the throne, and approaches the armed knights.] Albert (to the first.) If that my senses do not play me false, Or my eyes dazzle with your noble bearings, Methinks I read, beneath these quaint devices, Illustrious names! This flaming standard, Emblem of Etna's brow, that scorches Heav'n! This crest of gold, that like a meteor burns, Mocking the noon's fierce fires! do give thee out Messina's Prince, illustrious Belmonti! The Prince bows acknowledgment. Albert (to the second.) This verdant ensign, this enamell'd wreath (Tinted with rainbow dyes) which seems to grow, And, while its perfume scents the unseen air, Blushes with modest grace! I well devise Sprang from the 'witching garden of the world, Luxurious Italy! and therefore greet Verona's noble Duke, the brave Lorenzi! [The Duke bows acknowledgment. Albert (to the third.) This silv'ry banner, that doth like the waves Play in fantastic gambols with the air, Dancing light-blossom'd in the sunny beam, Bespeaks the Adriatic! Beauteous sea! That doth encompass Venice with a zone Bright as the morning sun! Thou dost declare The offspring of Bellarmo, Duke of Venice. [The Duke bows acknowledgment. Albert (approaching Alferenzi.) Now, gallant stranger, let me ask, nor think I mean uncourteously to mock your fancy, Why thus conceal'd you enter in the lists? What are your rights armorial? [Alferenzi points to his standard. Albert. 'Tis not enough That innate lustre beams about your soul! What are your claims to mingle in the contest? Alferenzi. Those claims that place the good above the proud! The stream that rushes thro' these ardent veins Flows from a source that never knew pollution! Though sprung, brave Albert, from a sire whose arm Has made the enemies of virtue tremble, I scorn to shield me with another's name, And only boast the honours I achieve. Albert. Most nobly urged! What is your passport here? Alferenzi. Nor gold, nor gems, nor purchas'd adulation, Nor vap'rish vaunting, nor the breath of fools! Nor flatt'ry's airy fame that bubbles down The broad stream of the world, and bursts at last In blank oblivion! Albert. High-sounding words Beguile with magic power the sense they seize, And cheat it into faith. But ere your name Shines on the list of valour, of your worth 'Tis fit you give some sample. Alferenzi. Take my scorn! [Throwing his gauntlet. Thus do I hurl my gauntlet at your feet And mock your scrutiny; the hand it owns Has neither palm'd with fools, nor let the base Its blood contaminate! what would you more? Albert. If that thy soul be lofty as thy speech, Thou art indeed right noble! I shall expect That thou wilt give me proof without delay. Alferenzi. I do not fear; my lance will do that for me. [The onset begins; Alferenzi stands more forward than the rest on the stage. Albert vanquishes Belmonti.] Alferenzi (aside.) So falls the vaunting self-enamour'd fool! The flame that soars too high evaporates, And wastes in empty nothing! [Albert disarms Lorenzi. Alferenzi (aside.) Honours full blown, like summer flow'rs, decay! I thought thy emblem was too fair to last! [Albert vanquishes Bellarmo. Alferenzi (aside.) So the swift storm scowls o'er the sunny spheres; Brave offspring of the proud and silv'ry main, Thou see'st that fame is fickle as the waves! [Albert advances and gazes at Alferenzi. Albert. Now, haughty stranger, I will prove thy lance; And either dim it with dishonour's stain, Or sink beneath thy scorn! [They fight; after a fierce onset, Alferenzi disarms Albert, and instantly kneeling, presents his scarf to Honoria, while the curtain falls to martial music.] SCENE III. —A Pavilion. Enter Honoria and Agnes. Honoria. It is my Alferenzi, gentle Agnes! He is the conqueror, and he well deserves The proud affections of my captive heart! Oh! didst thou mark him, when his glitt'ring lance, Like the blue lightning arm'd with threat'ning death, Rush'd on the bosom of his vanquish'd foe? Agnes. Each eye with admiration follow'd him Thro' all the varying conflicts of the scene! What is his parentage? his name is noble! Honoria. His father is a man of loftiest birth, A brave Sicilian! This, his only son, Was train'd to arms, and all Calabria's shores Have rung with plaudits at his bold exploits! Illustrious in himself, all outward show Borrows those graces which it cannot lend, For he derives no dignity from pow'r, By fortune less distinguish'd than by fame! Some few months since in Tuscany we met, And there profess'd such vows of tender faith, As neither time nor absence e'er can change. Hither he came disguis'd, in hopes to win My father's love by deeds of chivalry; He has unlock'd the treasure of his heart To my relentless parent, whose stern mind Is still devoted to Montalva's heir! Agnes. Alas! I know not how to give you counsel. Honoria. I did not think that Nature's finest art Could fashion Reason to sustain such woe! Heav'n knows there's nothing so forlorn as I! The sea-beat mariner, who on the shrouds Hangs at the mercy of the warring winds, Rock'd by the howling spirits of the deep, May count him in a cradle of repose, And think the roaring blast a zephyr's breath, Compar'd with passion's wild and madd'ning storm! Amidst the mingling labyrinths of thought, Bewilder'd Patience turns, and turns again, Till, hopeless and o'erwhelm'd, she faints and dies! Agnes. From childhood uncontrol'd, your soften'd mind But ill can combat life's perplexing thorns. Sole mistress of this castle's rich domains— Honoria. Aye! There again, oh! most disastrous state! A mother's care in infancy I lost, But the sad hour or manner of her death I never yet could learn; my father's frowns, Whene'er I press'd inquiry of her fate, Still aw'd me into silence. Oh! if she liv'd, Tho' poor, deserted, friendless, and oppress'd, I would, o'er burning plains, or wastes of snow, A barefoot wand'rer, seek her out, and bless her! Agnes. Strange rumours have been buzz'd abroad, and some Have dar'd accuse— Enter Albert. Albert. Honoria! is my destiny decreed! Wilt thou not bend thy footsteps to that altar Where meek-ey'd pity bathes the wounds of love? Honoria. Never! yon host of saints that know my thoughts, Know they are fix'd, and tow'ring o'er my fate, Like the vast rocks that bound the stormy main! Let the fierce tempest of a father's rage Dash my soul's purpose, as the foaming waves Waste their vain fury on the flinty shore! I can with patience bear all human ills; All that gaunt poverty can heap upon me; The cold disdain of insolence and pride, Peace-wounding calumny, or death itself! Rather than break my vows to Alferenzi. Albert. Perdition blast his hopes! the daring villain! But he shall perish! Honoria. What—because he loves? Oh! do not scatter my wild thoughts to frenzy! 'Tis not the province of a noble nature To plunge a poniard in the vanquish'd heart! Stain not thy glowing laurels, won by valour, With the pale lustre of a woman's tears. Albert, embattled legions have beheld Thy dauntless crest bound with immortal wreaths! Then know, the sword that's steep'd in gallant blood Should at the fount of pity cleanse its stains, Ere reason aches to see it! Spare thy foe, Nor let the poison fell of private hate Disgrace thy kindred or thy country's fame! Albert. I will be calm, if thou wilt bid me hope. Honoria. There's not a wretch that breathes but dares to hope. The wither'd tenant of a dungeon's gloom, Who, shut unpitied from the face of heav'n Almost forgets the radiance of the sun! Still in his prison sees effulgent hope, That dissipates the horrors of still night, And bids him smile upon his galling chain! That pow'r instinctive braves the tyrant's nod; Secure within itself, the conscious soul Still feeds on hope, and triumphs to the last! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Evening. Before Valmont's Castle. Enter Alferenzi. Alferenzi. This is the hour, when on yon lofty terrace Honoria comes to taste the evening air, And with the dulcet tinkling of her lute Bids the lorn nightingale forget his tale, And pause, in wonder rapt! The crimson west Gilds the grey battlements with blushing gold, And viewless myriads o'er the fainting flow'rs Close their long sultry day with humming song. As through the valley pensively I wander'd, At ev'ry cottage door the weary hind Sat 'midst his infant race, with ditty old, Cheating the trav'ller Time; while twilight's hand O'er the still landscape drew a dusky veil: Ere now, the freckled carle forgets the world, And in his unbarr'd chamber sweetly sleeps, Lull'd by the music of the mountain breeze! Enter Valmont, from the castle. Valmont. I thought to find the victor—Alferenzi! Alferenzi. Then thou art not deceived, for I am he— Valmont. It ill becomes a valiant son of honour To lurk at this still hour, and seek occasion To act a scene of darkness. Turn thy thoughts To the broad field of conquest and renown; Nor waste in am'rous folly manhood's prime, While glory and ambition claim your sword. Alferenzi. I do not need your counsel, for I know A soldier's valour is his country's fame! Yet Heaven forbid ambition's furious tide Should whelm the milder virtues of the soul: The proudest triumphs that await the brave Look not so beauteous in the sight of Heav'n As mercy's humblest tear! Valmont. A weak evasion! Again I tell thee, that Honoria's heart Is pledg'd to brave Montalva's only heir! Alferenzi. Her hand, thou mean'st; but may the God of battle Amidst whole legions of the foe forsake me, May foul dishonour blight my fairest hopes, If ever I renounce thy peerless child! Curst be the sordid wretch whose grov'ling soul Would bind in golden chains a trembling slave; Or, like a dastard, traffic with the base, To sell that freedom Heav'n design'd for all! Valmont. Thy rage, rash youth, can only move my pity; Nor will I dim the lustre of my sword To curb or to chastise—a daring stripling. Alferenzi (drawing his sword.) Defend thyself!—yet, soft, a moment's pause— Thou art the father of my soul's best darling; The source of all the light that gilds my days! And therefore—I forgive thee. Valmont. Vaunting slave! What then, at last thou prov'st thyself a braggart! An empty, bold, an arrogant presumer! Boy, the young blood forsakes thy quiv'ring lip— Is it the touch of fear or secret malice? [Alferenzi raises his sword, then lowers it. Guilt! conscious guilt unnerves thy trembling arm, While her pale ensign blanches o'er thy cheek; Nay, frown again, while I, with smiles repay The foe I scorn to combat. Alferenzi (sheathing his sword.) Have a care! I do conjure thee, venerable man, Urge not my hand to do a deed of horror! I would not be thy murd'rer— Valmont. Nobly said! Then swear, by faith, by honour, and your sword, Never again to see her. Dost thou pause? Alferenzi. O! bid me rather curse yon glorious orb, That rolls his burning chariot thro' the sky! Tell me, with base and sacrilegious hands To murder smiling infants, or profane Religion's still and consecrated shrine: Bid me rush forth, a damned parricide, And drink the life-stream of a parent's heart! There is no deed of horror so abhorr'd As violation of my faith to her. Valmont. She will but mock you; for to-morrow's dawn Will see her Albert's bride; and till that hour She keeps her chamber: such are my commands; And she respects a father's right too much To think of Alferenzi! Alferenzi. 'Tis false as hell. She will not so degrade the soul she owns, Nor will I brook a rival! Tell him so; Tell the vain boaster that a father's pride Shall by a lover's vengeance be chastis'd. [The Castle bell strikes. Valmont. The bell now calls me home to ev'ning pray'r. Mark me, rash boy; if ever you approach These castle walls again, without my bidding, That hour shall be your last! Think, and be wise. [Exit. Alferenzi. To-morrow! if thou op'st thy golden eye To see Honoria wedded to duke Albert, Thy parting glance shall shine upon my grave! Now will I to my solitary home, To taste a lover's only food, sharp sorrow! To paint on fancy's tablet my soul's joy, And dream of bliss—tho' I should wake to madness. [Exit. ACT II. SCENE V. A Gothic Hall, with a Gallery and Staircase. Enter Honoria and Agnes. Honoria. A pris'ner, said'st thou?—in my father's castle!— Here! where from infancy my growing reason Has taught me to look forward with delight! Is this the noontide of so blithe a promise? Oh! Agnes, happy is the mountain peasant That wakes exulting with the morning beam, And, still a stranger to the cares of greatness, Sinks to soft slumbers with the setting sun! The seasons are to him but pleasing changes Of labour and repose; his wife, his infants, The smiling subjects bound by nature's laws To decorate his little world of love! Agnes. Yet 'tis not always thus; for oft we see That virtue, to the rugged wild retir'd, Still finds the thorn affliction in its way. Honoria. But the rough child of nature knows no guile; No honey'd poison meets his healthful lips, Steep'd in the gilded chalice of deceit: By poverty, from envy far remov'd, No fawning sycophant assails his door, Where holy innocence presides, secure! Agnes. Give not your thoughts to melancholy musing; By pond'ring o'er past woe we oft neglect The means of future joy. Honoria. Now, hear me, Agnes; This night I promis'd in the forest's gloom To meet my Alferenzi; there to pour All my vast store of sorrows in his breast, And then to seek oblivion! Agnes. Yet, Forbear! Be not so rash; parental rage is transient, And nature bends the heart to suffering virtue! Honoria. Oh! could transcendent virtue's charm subdue The haughty spirit of my father's soul, He had not with remorseless rage depriv'd An only child of a fond mother's care. But she's in Heav'n! Agnes. Yet, see thy Alferenzi— Honoria. [Valmont appears in the gallery. Ah! do not mock my anguish; gods! to see him, O'er the bleak desert or the craggy mountain, Bow'd by the yelling blast and beating tempest, No light save that the livid flash afforded, Still would I wander, pleas'd and unrepining! Agnes. Attend—without the prospect of such danger, You may hold converse freely; the stern guard Your father makes the keeper of your prison I can persuade to pity; if you'll venture, The western portal shall be open to you, And in the forest, by the midnight moon, You may confer in safety, and unseen. Honoria. O! blessings on thee!—soft, this ray of hope Dazzles my aching senses, and I start As from a dream of horror, where the brain, Stampt with the semblance of some phantom dire, Reflects it, waking, to the fearful gaze! Now, gentle Agnes! seek my Alferenzi! Tell him, the gloom that hides a maiden's blush Presents no terror to the spotless soul! Guilt fears the witching hour of spectred night, When on the murd'rers front the starting drop Sits like the dew upon the pois'nous toad! But virtue, guided by its own pure ray, Treads the rude path, undaunted and secure. Now to thy task, and may the pow'rs of pity Guard thee from every ill! I will away, And in my prison chamber wait thy signal. [Exeunt severally. [Valmont descends from the gallery. Valmont. Go, disobedient fiend! Long shalt thou wait before thy minion comes: The midnight moon, reflecting what she sees, Shall veil her placid brow with tints of blood! No sound shall greet thine ear with signal kind; But the lone owl, with horror-boding shriek, Shall pierce thy love-sick, palpitating heart. How like her mother look'd the froward girl! On that dread night, when her proud father fell, So did she lure me to her fatal snare.— Away, reflection! vengeance calls me hence; And I obey the summons. SCENE VI. Before the Castle. Moonlight. Enter Albert, wrapped in a Venetian cloak. Albert. I cannot be deceived! I heard the voice of Agnes from the terrace Call soft on Alferenzi! if he attends The guilty bidding, ere the twilight gleams, Or he or I must fall! now sullen night Flings her star-spangled mantle o'er the globe, And spirits hostile to the soul of man Weave the dark web of mischief! bodings strange Knock at my heart and make my pulses beat As tho' the life-stream struggled with my fate. [A light appears in the tower. That is Honoria's chamber; and she wakes At this unusual hour; 'tis passing strange! Hah! she approaches! [Albert draws back. Agnes comes forth from the castle. Agnes. Francisco is our friend; Thus far kind fortune smiles upon our hopes! How lovely is this silence! The faint breeze Sleeps like an infant lull'd by its own song! Scarcely three hours have wing'd their tardy flight, Since from the watch-tow'r I distinctly marked The pensive Alferenzi: on a bank O'er-canopied by od'rous myrtle boughs, With folded arms, like one not loving life, Mournful he stood, inclining o'er the stream, That seem'd to soothe him with its murm'ring sound. [She hears footsteps. Now all the spirits of the night protect me! [Exit. Albert. Oh! busy, cunning minister of ill! Thou draw'st thy victim to that dizzy point From whence my sword shall hurl him to destruction! Come, sweet revenge, thou haggard imp of hell, Come, let me riot in thy iron arms, And glut my soul with luxury of hate! Some one approaches—to my hiding place Till I make sure of vengeance! [Retires into the wood. Enter Valmont, from behind the castle. Valmont. Ha! does the coward shun me? Thus have I caught the thief in his own snare: It must be Alferenzi, like a traitor, Lurking in ambush, with a villain's hand, To steal a father's treasure. Day's proud Lord Soon as he decks his eastern car with fire, Shall see the wily serpent writhe in death! Thou God of retribution! Thou whose voice Bids the pale caitiff dread the thunder's bolt, Now shield my arm, and let it strike securely. [Exit. They fight in the wood. Valmont re-enters, pale and aghast; one hand holds a drawn sword, the other is bleeding. Honoria opens a small door in the tower, and comes upon the battlements. Honoria. Agnes, oh! speak! is Alferenzi there! [A deep groan issues from the wood. Valmont starts. Hark! Do my startled senses yet deceive me, Or did I hear a soul-departing groan In yon dark tangled wood? Who passes there? Speak, or the castle bell shall raise the country. It must be some unwary traveller, Benighted in this solitary gloom, Waylaid and murder'd by conceal'd banditti! Valmont (fearfully.) Be still, Honoria, 'tis thy father, child. Send round a vassal to unbar the gate, For I am faint with anguish. Honoria. Heav'ns! why that piercing tone of trembling fear? I thought, ere now, that sleep had folded you On the soft couch of safety and repose. I will dispatch a vassal instantly To give you entrance. [Retires into the Tower. Valmont. Oh! thou blushing sword! Thou instrument accurs'd, that gave away My foul, sin-spotted soul, where shall I hide thee? [The gate opens. Valmont enters. SCENE VII. —Honoria's Chamber. A lamp burning near a window. A door open to the battlements, from which Honoria enters. The moon seen half concealed by clouds, opposite the door. Honoria, who wears the scarf of Alferenzi. Agnes not yet return'd! That groan of death Still vibrates on my brain, and bids me fear For Alferenzi's safety—Heav'n protect him! Valmont enters, with his sword drawn and his hand smear'd with blood. He shrinks at the sight of Honoria, who shrieks and runs towards him. Honoria. Prophetic pow'rs! Hah! what am I to think? Why is that hand so gash'd, and stain'd with blood? Speak, ere the current of my heart congeals, And all my faculties freeze up with horror! Thou'rt deadly pale! and the cold dew of fear Doth glisten on thy brow! Alas! my father! [Falls on his neck. Valmont (wildly.) Peace! be silent. Heard you not the tempest That shook our lofty tow'rs from their foundation? Saw you the black wing of the howling blast Sweeping our turrets, red with human gore? Honoria. I pray thee, help me bind this bleeding hand. Ah! let me call assistance; thou art faint! [Honoria binds the scarf round Valmont's bleeding hand. Valmont. Call, call the world's vast multitude to curse me! Let hungry vultures batten on my heart; Pluck out mine eyes to feed the eagle's brood, Lest they, by gazing on thee, fear thy beauty! Honoria. Whence comes this strange disorder of thy brain? Valmont. From that infernal gulph where guilty souls Howl in despair! Oh! 'twas a stormy hour! The earth was palsied, and the vaulted spheres Flash'd forth indignant flames, while all around Pale spectres yell'd in triumph o'er the deed! Honoria. Thy fancy doth beguile thy better reason; A night more still and calm I ne'er have seen! 'Tis the sweet pause when nature sinks to rest, To wake again with renovated charms! No object seems to move, save the thin clouds, That, slowly floating o'er the grey expanse, Veil the bright forehead of the silv'ry moon. Valmont. Thou art deceiv'd! There is a fiend abroad with mildew wing, Blighting creation! Hell yawns forth monsters, And the blue air is chok'd with poison'd mists, Thick'ning to hide the gen'ral wreck of nature! Say, wilt thou aid the ministers of wrath To curse an aged father? Honoria. Heav'n shield me from the thought! Why dost thou ask such incoherent questions? Whose were the crimson drops that stain thy sword? Valmont. He met me on my way; he cross'd my path; Revenge, unsated, panted for his blood! Would I had perish'd ere my sword had reach'd him. Honoria. Whom dost thou mean? Valmont. Thy lover!—Alferenzi! Honoria. Oh! monstrous and inhuman! quit my sight, Lest I should, darting o'er the bounds of reason, Tear all the bonds of filial love asunder, And brand thee with the name of an assassin! Go, hide thyself for ever, rash old man, For thy deep-furrow'd cheek is stampt with murder! Valmont. Restrain thy frenzy; know, a father's life Depends upon thy silence: I must hence Before the broad and blabbing eye of day Glares on the scene of slaughter! Fare thee well! I would embrace thee ere we part for ever, But that these red contaminated hands Would stain thy white and unpolluted soul! [Going. Honoria. Thou shalt not leave me: Thou, whom the voice of nature taught me first To love and honour, art more dear than ever, Because thou art more wretched. [She goes to embrace her father, sees the bloody sword, and recoils with horror. Put up that sword! It blasts my shatter'd senses! Oh! I am lost! my wild ethereal spirit Springs o'er the confines of this world's despair, And flies to Alferenzi! Valmont (sheathing his sword.) Already the grey dawn steals o'er the forest, And tips our battlements with dusky light; Danger comes trembling on the wings of time, And time, not daring to record the deed, Flies swiftly on! Come, let me lead thee, love. Honoria (wildly.) Oh! lead me where all memory shall fade; Where blank oblivion desolates the scene! Yet, stay; I have a secret to unfold. Seest thou yon star, that in the rosy East Stands, like a lacquey, at the gates of day, Scatt'ring afar the shadow-vested clouds That on the glitt'ring threshold ling'ring hung? All will be well! The sun will warm his breast, And Heav'n's own tears, unseen by mortal eyes, Will consecrate his grave! so pure is pity! Enter Francisco. Honoria endeavours to conceal her father, particularly his hand. Honoria to Francisco (wildly.) Well? Is he dead? What else has brought thee hither? All guiltless souls devote this hour to sleep; Then why are we still waking? Who art thou? Francisco. Forgive me, lady, for this bold intrusion; But the deep groans I heard beneath our walls Urg'd me to seek the Marquis— Honoria. Why? what is it to him? He knows not of it; And if he did, 'tis now, alas! past cure. Valmont. This is the wand'ring of her scatter'd thonghts; Do not disturb her farther; now, good night; Get thee to bed [sternly], and when the sun peeps forth, We'll to the forest—but your lady's safety, Her mind disorder'd by some unknown cause, Requires that I should watch her for a time: Nay, no reply. Francisco, fare thee well. [Exit Francisco. Come, let me lead thee. Honoria. Would it were to my grave! [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. A Pavilion at Montalva's Castle. Enter the Prince Montalva meeting Francisco. Francisco. Oh! venerable Prince! I've news to tell Will seize the feeble fibres of thy brain, And tho' thy nerves could mock the temper'd steel, Would shiver them with horror! Montalva. Where's my son? All the long night I watch'd for his return. Heav'n grant no ill betide him. Francisco. Well I know, He that reports ill news ungracious seems, Howe'er his phrase be fashion'd: therefore hear A tale that mocks all harmony of speech! Startled by groans of anguish, I arose Ere I had pressed my pillow one short hour, And to the forest, where the tow'rs of Valmont Rear their dark battlements, pursu'd my way; There, hold my heart while I reveal a story Big with all Hell's worst horrors! your brave son Lay by the thicket side, a piteous corse; The ruddy stream once mantling o'er his cheek Had flown to drench a dire assassin's sword! Montalva. Nay, then, my weary journey soon will end, And my long pilgrimage of worldly woe Fade like a fev'rish dream! The source is still From whence my spring of rapture rose so bright! The flow'r that deck'd my silver hairs is dead! Blasted and scatter'd by the ruthless storm! Francisco. Oh! 'twas a cruel deed— Montalva. Alas! Francisco! And shall I never see my child again? Never, in converse sweet, beguile the hour That closes life's dull scene? It is most strange, So near the castle, and at night's still noon, When ev'ry moaning breeze distinctly steals O'er meditation's ear, to be so butcher'd! Francisco. I know not what to think; yet much I fear Some secret malice urg'd the murd'rer's sword More than the hope of plunder. Montalva. Even so! Oh! good Francisco! Heav'n absolve my soul, If, without proof, I judge a fellow creature; But shrewd suspicion points at Alferenzi: A rival's hate alone could prompt an act So fraught with ruin! Oh! my gallant Albert! Francisco. Say, shall I lead you to him? The rude swains And village girls have strew'd his graceful corse, And ev'ry fragrant bud was steep'd in tears! Montalva. Ah! let me not behold him; for my eyes, If once they fix'd upon my murdered boy, Would start with anguish from their humid spheres, And yield me up to darkness! Here I swear, Never to cherish hope or seek repose Till I have dragg'd the curst assassin forth, And, by the last deep groan that rends his heart, Appeas'd the spirit of my valiant son! [Exeunt. SCENE IX. —In the castle of Valmont. Enter Alferenzi and Agnes. Alferenzi. Gone! said'st thou Agnes? Both, at break of day, Their course unknown, sudden, and unattended What can it mean? Tell me, good gentle damsel, Left she no word of kind remembrance for me? Agnes. I knew not of their flight till they departed; Before the midnight hour crept half way on To that which time proclaims the new-born day, With sighs and tears, and many earnest pray'rs, She vow'd her love and truth to Alferenzi. Alferenzi. Say on, fair Agnes! To the tortur'd wretch, Stung by the pois'nous spider to the heart, The sound of minstrelsy is not so sweet! Agnes. Wrung to the soul by a stern father's rage, Last night she form'd the fatal resolution, In cold monastic gloom to end her days; And scarce an hour before her sudden flight Me she dispatch'd to give you timely notice, That to the forest she would steal at midnight, And, by the waning lustre of the moon, Bid her fond hopes and you farewell for ever. Alferenzi. Oh! most inhuman thought! most barb'rous wish! Why did she fail to keep her promise then? Agnes. Alas! I know not; after tedious search To find you wand'ring at th' appointed place, I hasten'd to the castle, where I found The outward gate unbarr'd; I pass'd along The solitary courts, o'erwhelm'd with fear! No light appear'd around the spacious pile, Save a small lamp, which at a lattice grate Shot from the western tow'r a feeble ray. Alferenzi. Why from the western tow'r? Who rested there? Agnes. It was the prison of my lovely mistress. [Alferenzi starts. The melancholy stillness of the night Made my own footsteps echo as I trod The gothic cloisters that surround the courts: On the white marble of the banner'd hall I mark'd fresh drops of blood! and further on— Alferenzi. Hold! and be careful, I conjure thee, Agnes; There is more terror in those little words Than in the prospect of eternal pangs! The father of Honoria! Oh! my soul! This is thy last dread trial: she is dead! The barbarous fiend has blotted nature's page, And written murder with his poniard curst Steep'd in the fountain of his daughter's heart! Agnes. Next to the chamber of my darling mistress I flew, with hurried step and beating heart; There, strew'd about, I saw her rich apparel, That deck'd her person when I parted from her; Her cross of brilliants, and her em'rald zone, Thrown carelessly aside. Alferenzi. O! damned monster! Agnes. Then, wild with horror! to the northern tow'r, Where the stern father erst was wont to pass The midnight hour in sullen meditation, I rush'd impatient; 'twas the dawn of day, And thro' the painted casements purple light Cast a faint lustre on the fearful gloom. I gaz'd around me— Alferenzi. Was the blood there too? Agnes. Yes; on the garment of the haughty marquis: The vest he wore last night was crimson-spotted With human gore; scarce cold when I beheld it! Alferenzi. Oh! 'tis most sure! Agnes. Now hear me, Alferenzi; Prepare thy soul to meet another proof, As black as hell itself! I then descended By a small winding staircase, dark and damp, To the long gall'ry where, in pictur'd pomp, The steel-clad ancestors of Valmont hung. The clock struck three! Beneath the fretted roof The hollow-sounding echo ling'ring stole! I started! Horror chain'd me to the spot! When, gazing on the ground with fear-fix'd eyes, I mark'd this blood-stain'd scarf, which, when I left My angel mistress, veil'd her beauteous breast! Alferenzi, taking the scarf. Oh! horrible! beyond what thought can frame! [Puts the scarf into his bosom. Grow to my anguish'd heart. Oh! wounded nature! If in my breast one spark of mercy gleams, Let these red drops extinguish it for ever! [Enter Francisco. Francisco, where's thy mistress? quickly speak. Francisco. I fear, most noble Sir, she's in her grave! When last I saw her— Alferenzi. Was she not living? Francisco. Scarcely, my Lord; so sadly wan she look'd, That my old eyes did make my manhood blush Thro' many a trickling tear. Alferenzi. Poor victim! And didst thou leave her so, unfeeling slave? Francisco. My Lord, I left her to a father's care; She seem'd most deeply troubled; for her words Were incoherent, wild, and sorrowful! I would have call'd assistance, but the marquis Commanded me to leave them. Alferenzi. Alone! Francisco? Francisco. Alone, my Lord; I dar'd not disobey; His looks were terrible, and much I fear Some direful purpose rankled in his soul. Alferenzi. Francisco, get thee hence; and let thy zeal Give strict observance to thy searching eye. Explore all secret corners of the castle, Each darken'd niche, and ev'ry lofty tow'r; Murder's a lurking fiend, and shuns the gaze Of broad-ey'd honesty! Now fare thee well. [Exit Francisco. Agnes, this father is a vile assassin! A barb'rous monster, sacrilegious slave! Who to the demon of insatiate wrath Has sacrificed the life of his dear child! Oh! thou fell wolf, could not so sweet a lamb, With all the graceful eloquence of nature, Arrest thy butcher's hand, and turn the knife On thy own curs'd and most relentless bosom! All Erebus, conspiring with thy fate, Sent forth its blackest fiend to aid the deed, And drag thy trembling soul to deep perdition! Agnes. 'Tis likely noble Albert interpos'd Too late to save Honoria, and was slain By the rash marquis to impede pursuit. Alferenzi. Impossible! none but the famish'd tiger Would kill the thing it lov'd; if Valmont's soul Could bend a moment from its churlish mood, That Albert was the dearest to his heart. Alas! Honoria was his only victim! Her bosom was the unpolluted temple Where innate truth, majestically thron'd, Fear'd not the subtle glance of malice fell, Till, like the Basilisk, it seal'd its prey, And feasted on its idol! All the earth I'll traverse o'er to seek the monstrous villain; And may the blue-wing'd bolts of Heav'n destroy me, If e'er I rest till vengeance is complete! [Exeunt. ACT III. SCENE X. The inside of a cavern. The setting sun seen through a chasm in the rock. Ricardo and other banditti discovered drinking. Ricardo. 'Tis strange, that thro' this solitary wood No traveller has pass'd since yester-dawn! Beshrew me but I'm weary of our trade; Knaves are so multiplied, that honest men Live better than ourselves; and more secure, For each depends upon himself alone. Second Robber. Ricardo, dost thou doubt our firm alliance? Ricardo. In truth, not I; it is the Time's disease That palsies honesty; for villains thrive In such profusion of victorious guilt, That secresy is useless to our calling. Why skulk in cavern'd mountains, shrink from light, And lurk in ambush for the trav'ller's gold, While in the broad effulgence of full noon, In cities, throng'd with gaping multitudes, The bolder caitiff plunders all secure! Third Robber. Thou know'st the world, Ricardo. Ricardo. Yes; enough To make me shun one half the race of man, And pity all the rest! so frail is nature! First Robber. Discrimination finds no easy task In searching the gay paths of busy life, Where all is outward artificial show, Put on to varnish falsehood. Ricardo. True; but deception wears so thin a mask, That stern philosophy ne'er fails to note it. Whatever shape, complexion, or disguise, Hypocrisy may take, of ermin'd robe, Or threadbare vestment scant, or witching smile, Or cynic brow austere, it cannot hide The base deformity that lurks within; The bold and ragged knave less dang'rous still Than he who pranks him in a cloth of gold! Valmont. (without.) Hillo! within there. Ricardo. Silence, good fellows: Let us retire, and shrewd observance make Of our unwary guest; perchance some poor And woe-worn pilgrim here would find a nook To shield his body from the midnight blast: Do not forget, my comrades, we are men. [Exeunt to the inner cave. Enter Valmont, in the habit of a vassal, supporting Honoria, who has a white veil partly thrown off her face: she enters fearfully. Valmont. Here nothing can molest thee. Night draws near, And ere dim shadows shroud the twilight gleam I'll venture forth; not far from this lone spot I mark'd a clust'ring vineyard, whose scorch'd bank Was kindly freshen'd by a limpid spring, That from the neighb'ring steep meand'ring flow'd. They shall supply our solitary meal; And, when the smiling yellow-vested morn Crowns with a wreath of gold the eastern hill, We will pursue our journey. Cheerly, love; Look up, and all our miseries will end. Honoria. Think'st thou that murder will not cry aloud, And rouse the fates to vengeance? Will yon Heav'n, Whose beamy eye encompasseth the world, Wink at the deed of horror? Ev'ry thorn That festers in the deeply-wounded mind May from Time's lenient pow'r a balsam take To draw its poison forth; save where the hand, Blurr'd with the life-stream of a fellow creature, Contaminates the means ordain'd to heal, And leaves the wretch past cure! Valmont (grasping his sword.) 'Twere best to die! That cure at least is ready to my grasp; Thou know'st I am no coward— Honoria. Dreadful thought! Oh! wouldst thou then destroy thy better part, Turn from the balsam Heav'n in pity leaves To cleanse thy soul's deep wound and seal its pardon? Wouldst thou sum up the dark account of horrors, And, by the sure damnation of thy deed, Rush from this transitory scene of anguish To the dread chaos of eternal woe? Valmont. The complicated pangs that rend my heart Would melt the ministers of wrath to mercy. Honoria. But will not justice urge her sacred claim? Will not the tongues of men denounce the act That bids humanity recoil, aghast? Valmont. Why did I quit my home? My lofty state Had silenc'd busy clamour, and forbad The breath of calumny to taint my name! Honoria. Oh! empty sophistry! delusive hope! 'Tis in thy greatness thy conviction lies. Unseen, the sweetest low-born buds decay; But the proud Cedar, tow'ring on the rock, Stands like a land-mark to attract men's eyes; And, tho' it shares the bright meridian blaze, It cannot 'scape the pelting of the storm! Valmont. Soon as my footsteps greet Helvetia's land, I may defy my fate; for there, secure, What slave shall menace Valmont? Ricardo (observing them from the inner cave.) Valmont! Valmont. Hah! heard'st thou not a voice, with hollow sound, Repeat the name of Valmont? Honoria. Such it seem'd; 'Twas but the echo of this vaulted cave. Now let me rest; and while you venture forth To seek refreshing fruits, I'll watch and pray! Valmont. I will not leave thee long; and Heav'n, I trust, Will guard thee till my weary steps return. [Exit. Honoria. Now all is still, and terrible as death! Here meditation fearfully employs The melancholy hour; yet unappall'd Hood-wink'd destruction seems to stalk secure! What, if my father should no more return? How shall I find my way? where seek repose? Oh! Alferenzi! [taking a picture from her bosom] if thy spirit blest Could visit these dread haunts, thou wouldst appear, To soothe me with a gleam of consolation! Ricardo (still observing her.) I will protect thee! Honoria. Celestial pow'rs! again the airy voice Of some prophetic spirit strikes my soul With petrifying sounds! Perhaps this cave, Fill'd with enchantment, is the dark abode Of spectres horrible, whose bleeding wounds Make ghastly show of murder unaveng'd! An icy languor creeps along my veins, Forewarning me of danger near at hand! My father, oh! return.—He hears me not! Where shall I hide me? all within is death! And all without, a solitary wild, Bestrew'd with thorns and perilous to tread! This inner cavern will be less expos'd To the night's nipping air— [The robbers rush forth. O God! defend me! What is your intent? I do expect some mercy, as you hope Yourselves to be forgiv'n! Second Robber. What are you, lady? Honoria. The wretched offspring of a wretched Sire; A wand'ring exile from my native home; Too poor for plunder, and too proud to weep; For I believe that virtue bears a charm Which bids the boldest villain shrink appall'd. Third Robber (siezing Honoria.) Nay, if you brave us—you shall know our pow'r! Ricardo. Ruffian! stand back. Sweet lady, you are safe! For he that lifts his sacrilegious hand To strike at helpless woman, shames mankind, And sinks his coward soul so deep in hell, That nature scorns to own him! Spare your thanks; I will defend you; we are desp'rate men; But cruelty can never urge that sword Which courage vaunts the bearing. Honoria. Generous man! Now I can weep! But they are thankful tears! Wrongs urge the soul to vengeance, and call forth That pride which proves the antidote to grief; But kindness steals so sweetly o'er the sense, So melts the throbbing heart with tender joy, That, as the sun darts forth amidst the storm, The eye of grateful rapture beams thro' tears! Ricardo. Soon must I leave you, for the hour draws near Which calls us to our watchful occupation. Honoria (kneeling to Ricardo.) O! hear me. If in your pathway you should chance to meet A venerable man, for my sake spare him! His years are nearly number'd; let him live To make his peace with Heav'n! for much, I fear, He's not prepar'd for death! Ricardo. He shall be safe. Now, let me counsel you to seek repose. In yon small cavern lies a rushy couch, Where innocence may taste of balmy dreams, For guilt has often slumber'd there secure! Lady, Heav'n guard you! [Exeunt banditti. Honoria. Thou art not us'd to pray! and yet thy voice May find swift passport to the realms of grace, When pious fraud may supplicate in vain; For thou art merciful! Alas! I fear Some savage thing hath cross'd my father's way; The prowling wolf; or, what is far more fell, Man, without pity for his hapless kind! Thou solitary den, where guilt retires To hold fierce converse with the fiends accurs'd, Undaunted I approach thee! for that pow'r Which guards the cradled infant while it sleeps, Sustains the lab'ring bark amidst the storm, And, while the tempest rends the mountain pine, Shields the poor shepherd's cot, will not forsake The child of sorrow in the hour of rest! [Exit to the inner cave. SCENE XI. Night. On one side, the Apennines, with the entrance of a Cavern half way up; on the other, a thick wood. Enter Valmont. Valmont. Oh! what a lost and wretched thing is man! Who, bold in Hell's worst embassy, will start At the small rustling of a beetle's wing! The wind that moans along these cavern'd cliffs Seems like the murmurs of a thousand tongues That tell my soul's undoing! The faint stars, The many-million eyes of prying Heav'n, Gleam humid, and surcharg'd with nature's tears! Yet what of that? 'Tis but my mind's disease, That feeds faint reason with portentous signs, And makes it sicken at the touch of thought! What have I not committed that Heav'n loathes? First, in the ghastly train of hellish crimes, A noble brother, who in my defence Slew a proud Milanese, beheld in me His curs'd accuser; and, to exile driv'n, Left me the lord of all his vast domains. Next, a chaste wife I banish'd from her home; My fickle sense was sated with her charms, And meaner beauties triumph'd in their turn! Where shall my fev'rish conscience find repose? All the long sunny day, when Summer smiles, And leads old Time in flow'ry garlands on, A living spectre, hopeless and forlorn, I journey forth to an oblivious grave? Nor at that fearful goal will the dread strife Feel blissful termination; for beyond The rending pangs that warn the trembling soul From its clay habitation, reason tells Of something terrible! and yet so sure, That nature starts to think on't! Hark! what stirs? [Alferenzi appears in the wood, and the day begins to dawn. Is it the potent fever of my brain That takes my coward fancy prisoner, Or do I hear the sound of mortal tread? [After listening and looking round. 'Twas but the waving of the sun-parch'd boughs, Whose tawny canopy o'erspreads the wood. [Valmont advances towards the cavern. Alferenzi rushes forward. Valmont. Horrible spectre! wherefore dost thou haunt me? Why from the shrouded pallet of the grave Present the form of murder'd Alferenzi? In pity hence; for know, that spirits pure Can hold no converse with a damned wretch, In whose convulsive soul all hell is raging! Away! away! Alferenzi. Valmont! thy hour draws near! I know thee, and will try what guardian fiend Will blunt my sword, uplifted to destroy thee! What wraps thee so in horrible conceit? Valmont. Thick mystery! that dims the mental eye, And makes us, scarce believe us that we are, Seeing, what cannot be! 'Tis all illusion. Alferenzi. Strike at my heart, inexorable parent! Or guard thy own, for one of us must fall. [Drawing his sword. Valmont. If Alferenzi lives, then all is well! Alferenzi. All is not well, prevaricating slave! Draw, draw thy sword; let Heav'n decide between us Valmont (drawing his sword.) Then be it so! Though thou hast once escap'd, Thou'rt not invulnerable: now, come on; I'll teach thy tongue to quell its lofty phrase, Or perish in the combat. [They fight; Honoria rushes forth from the cavern, and stands before the entrance. Honoria. Oh! spare him! spare him! [Alferenzi drops his sword. Barbarian, do not kill an aged man! Or stay thy sword, and let me perish with him! (Honoria descends; Alferenzi recedes.) Alferenzi. Thou sainted spirit! shade of my Honoria! That, like an angel, com'st to turn my sword, And save my soul, thirsting for blood of man, Do not approach me! ev'ry trembling nerve Obeys thy potent eye, and the cold drops That bathe my brain will quench the ray of reason. Honoria (Valmont leans against a tree.) He lives! he lives! It is my Alferenzi! Light of my life! dearer than life itself! [Embracing. Oh! do these eyes behold thee once more breathing? My father, here, before the face of Heav'n, Kneel, and adore the minister of pity, Who, bending from its sphere, restores him to us! (Valmont appears pale and faint. Honoria supports him.) Speak! art thou hurt? Hah! from thy mangled breast The life-stream gushes! Ye relentless pow'rs! Turn not the measure of my joy to woe! [Valmont falls; Honoria kneels. Let me support thee: look upon thy child: Oh! speak, for I must hear thy voice once more, To say, that thou forgiv'st me: Save him, Heav'n! Valmont. Sweet image of a chaste and injur'd saint! A dying father's blessing shall be thine. Honoria. Thou shalt not die; I cannot live to see Those darling eyes closed in the sleep of death! Valmont. Brave Alferenzi! I believ'd thee murder'd; In the dark-tangled wood that skirts our castle, I saw thee fall, thrice wounded by my sword. Alferenzi. Thy victim was duke Albert! Hapless Valmont, Heav'n's sure to hear when murder cries for justice! Honoria. Oh! mis'ry supreme! oh! my lost father! Valmont. If yet the noble Leonardo lives, Seek out his lone asylum, and restore The just possession of his rich domains; Tell him, that Heav'n at last aveng'd his wrongs, And humbled his proud brother to the dust! Now let me press thee to my streaming heart; [To Honoria. Alas! my parting sigh will soon extinguish The feeble lamp of life, and my last pang Pay the dread forfeit which my crimes demand! [Dies. Honoria (to Alferenzi.) Now, is thy rage appeas'd? If thy fell soul Still pants for Valmont's blood, strike here! this heart, This bursting heart, will scorn to sue for pity. Alferenzi. Do not distract me with thy fierce reproaches; A dread coincidence of time and act Drew me from Reason's empire to Despair! 'Dire and disastrous as the deed may seem, Twas to avenge thy wrongs that I am guilty; For I believ'd that Valmont—thy assassin! Let me entreat thee to be patient, love. Honoria. Hence with thy feign'd contrition! my weak brain Burns with the frenzy thou hast heap'd upon it. Alferenzi. This sight will make thee mad! Quit, quit the scene, Nor feed the gnawing anguish of thy soul. Soon will I bear thee to my native shores, Where, 'midst the fond endearments of new friends, Of noble kindred, and resplendent joys, The mem'ry of past grief shall fade away. Honoria. (rising.) Oh! 'twill not be! This is my destin'd home! I'd rather wander like a pilgrim poor! Toil, like a slave who in the torrid blaze Curses the sun that mark'd him for despair, Than journey thither: here will I remain. Oh! the vast sum of my disastrous life Seems like an atom to this world of woe! [Honoria returns to the body. Yet let me kiss that cheek, pale and distorted Stern was thy aspect, yet my soul would give Half its dear hopes of an immortal crown To see those eyes but once more gaze upon me But they are dark, clos'd in the sleep of death Alferenzi. Let me conceal thee in some spot secure, While to the earth I give this breathless corse. I do not covet life, depriv'd of thee, And wilt thou doom me to the tort'ring rack? Canst thou behold this throbbing, loyal heart, Mangled and bleeding as a public show? Wilt thou not shudder when the rabble's shout Shall drown the agonizing groan of death? Honoria. Oh! do not torture me; alas! my soul Already shrinks beneath its weight of grief, Wherefore deny a murder'd father's dust The holy incense of a filial tear? No other rite will consecrate his grave! Alferenzi. Delay brings danger; see, the purple dawn Is gayly tissu'd o'er with beamy gold! The merry birds begin their matin songs, And new-born glory animates the scene! Let me conceal thee in yon cavern'd cliff. Honoria. Ha! now I do bethink me, wretched man! This is no place for parley! Yon dark cave Is the dread haunt of robbers: get thee hence; Danger and death await thee! Oh! begone. Alferenzi. What! leave thee to the mercy of banditti? Forsake thee, helpless, faint, forlorn and sad, To be the victim of wild rioters! The sport of ruffians—lawless, cut-throat knaves! Beside yon mountain a poor clay-built shed I slightly noted as I pass'd along; Fly, fly thee thither; I will follow soon. Honoria. Oh! dread alternative! oh! cruel task! Betake thyself to flight, ill-fated man! For we must meet no more! One little word, One parting sigh, still struggles at my heart! Ha! look not so upon me! Is it thus Our intercourse must end? our radiant morn Of love, and hope, and youth, and tender joy, Shadow'd by sorrow, and convuls'd with storms!— Go to thy splendid home, thy friends await thee; Death is preparing in the silent tomb A lonely bed, where I shall sleep at peace. [Exit. Alferenzi. Now in yon cave will I conceal this corse; And then, O God! teach me to hide myself From my own knowledge! Busy, busy thought, Away, and let oblivion be thy grave! [He advances towards the body; the scene closes. ACT IV. SCENE XII. A Wood, Morning. Enter the Prince Montalva and Francisco. Montalva. 'Twas at the entrance of this lonely wood My mules were to be station'd—are they come? Francisco. Not yet my lord; so, please you, wait awhile In this cool shade; the sun swift journeys high, And soon will shed intolerable day. Montalva. Is there no lowly hut where we may rest? Affliction preys upon my feeble frame, And bends me to the earth: I fain would live A little while, to do an act of justice. My vassals all are arm'd, and on the watch, And yet we have no tidings! Let us seek Some hospitable shed to stay their coming. Francisco. Among the craggy hills, not far from hence, An hermit dwells; a poor, but holy man! Time that has furrow'd o'er his meagre cheek Ne'er saw it blush for any act of shame: His herds, his vineyard, foster'd by his hand, Repay his labours with that homely fare Which conscious virtue renders passing sweet! If in so low a dwelling you can rest, I think you'll be right welcome. Montalva. Well I know, 'Tis not beneath the gilded dome of state, Nor 'midst the gaudy sycophantic tribe, That peace delights to dwell; she bends her way To the poor hermit's hospitable roof, Where Liberty, the fairest child of heav'n! Smiles on his board, and with her sacred voice Bids him look down upon the high-born base, Tho' great in splendour, if they're less than men! Now to the mountain hut. Lead on, Francisco. [Exeunt. SCENE XIII. Among the Apennines. Leonardo, as an hermit, comes forth from a small hut, with two baskets and a wicker bottle. Enter the Prince Montalva and Francisco. Francisco. Good father, bless you! Leonardo. Thanks for your greeting; And bless you, gentle son; is it your wish To stay awhile, and mend your strength with food? Montalva. We'll enter, honest heart, with your good leave; And for your cheer will recompense you nobly. Leonardo. Divine benevolence repays itself! And much it grieves me to deny your suit; But my good-will is shackled by restraint, While seeming churlishness, in truth, is pity. Montalva. We will not be denied. Leonardo (guarding his hut, and setting down his basket, &amp;c. &amp;c.) Sooth, but you must! Not for an empire should your footsteps pass This narrow threshold. I will bring you food. Francisco. What dost thou mean? Thy miserable hut Hath never shelter'd yet a guest so noble. Leonardo. Think'st thou I prize the gifts which fortune owns? If he has true nobility of soul, He tow'rs above the attributes of wealth, And wants no other charm to make him great! But wherefore scoff at this, my poor abode? It is mine own; these wither'd hands did raise it: My board is simply strew'd; but what of that? 'Tis with the gifts of Heav'n! and who shall say The proudest mortal can be better fed? I flatter no man, and am no man's slave! My garb is coarse and scant; but let the vain, Wrapp'd in the vital labours of the worm, Say if their pulses beat as calm as mine! No bed of down or canopy of gold Here pampers fev'rish luxury to rest; But on my lonely pillow temp'rance waits, And prompts repose that splendour cannot give! How many, deck'd in all the pride of state, With ermine stole, and starry wreath of gems, Would gladly lay their guilty trappings by, To taste the tranquil joys that mark the hours In what thou call'st, my miserable hut! Montalva (taking out his purse.) Then do not act the churl; and drive us hence, Wanting the lowly lodging we would hire At ten-fold value; this will buy men's souls, And tempt the sternest sanctity to sin! Bid the cold anchoret renounce his vows; The rosy vestal sell her youthful hopes, To wed with shrivell'd age; and, with its gloss, So dazzle mortal eyes, that nature smiles To see philosophers the slaves of fools, And her own dross, the bribe of their dishonour! What cannot gold subdue? Leonardo. Philanthropy!— That sympathetic love of human kind Which instinct cherishes in souls sublime! Which bids pale mis'ry raise the languid eye, While the recording cherub seals the bond That Heav'n repays with rapture! Montalva. Thy words most strangely contradict thy deeds! Thou talk'st of kindness, yet with churlish mien Bidst the lorn traveller with hunger faint. Shame on the wretch who vaunts humanity But to draw forth the misery he mocks With curious eye to scrutinize the heart, And yet refuse the pity that would heal it! He has no right to pry into my fortunes Who has no tear to mitigate their woes! Leonardo. Nay, now you rate me with reproach so keen, That my old eyes are drown'd in drops of grief! Full twenty winters have my weary feet Trod the white pathway of these frozen hills; Yet never did I bar my humble cell Against the trav'ller faint; but I have sworn, And may I perish if I break my oath, To shield from ev'ry eye the gorgeous gem That casket rude contains! Forth I repair'd To gather fruits and rob the limpid spring For my sweet fugitive, who seems most sad And vanquish'd by despair. Are ye not men? And can ye blame or wonder at the zeal That snatches beauteous woman from the grave? Long have I brav'd the bleak and stormy wind; Forsworn all intercourse with worldly joy; Liv'd a poor hermit, cheerless and alone!— When the fann'd snow fell fast upon my roof, Whole nights I've listen'd to the howling wolves; Fear never thrill'd my heart nor blanch'd my cheek;— Yet have I not the courage to behold A fellow creature fall, whom I could save! Montalva. A task so pious must not be delay'd. Pursue thy way, good heart, and, trust my word, I will not trespass, or with curious eye Profane thy dwelling blest! but near the door Will watch with zeal so pure, that none shall dare To pass the threshold. Leonardo. I will soon return; My vineyard is hard by; be of good cheer. [Exit Leonardo. Francisco. Oft have I seen this melancholy sage, When by the side of these snow-mantled cliffs I chas'd the fire-ey'd wolf. His manners mild And hospitable cell have spread his fame Beyond the borders of the rushing Po; For many an infant, on its grandsire's knee, With fond attention and inquiring eye, Prattles of good Anselmo. Montalva. Anselmo! He that is nam'd the hermit of the cliffs? Francisco. The same; and much it moves surprise in all, That so much virtue, and so rich a mind, Should give to solitude their cheerless days. Re-enter Leonardo. Leonardo. First to my beauteous fugitive, and then Together we will make our healthful meal. Here, courteous stranger, spread the frugal treat On the green bank, and I'll return to bless it. [Gives one basket to Francisco, and with the other enters the cell, but instantly returns. Leonardo. She sleeps! The weary senses charg'd with grief Are numb'd by their own anguish, stealing health E'en from the poison that did sicken them! Montalva. In truth, good hermit, you excite my wonder! Nor can ingenious reason find a cause Why choice should lead you to a spot so drear, That spurr'd necessity recoils to view it! Leonardo. Alas! a story so replete with woe, So full of horror, will but move your pity! Sprung from an ancient race, my morn of life Gave the bright earnest of a lustrous day! But in those hours when young intemp'rate blood Seizes the fever of uncurb'd desire, It is not strange that reason's sober ray Was quench'd and smother'd by impetuous breath. A friend!—Oh! how did he blaspheme the name!— Woo'd a sweet lady: she was Milan's rose; That shed rich lustre on each humbler flow'r! Her sire ador'd her, and with tender care Sought such alliance as might grace her birth. My friend was but his father's youngest son, And small his means, compar'd with his descent. One fatal night, 'twas when the blushing spring Fann'd my warm bosom with the austral breeze, Flush'd with the grape, in merry, harmless mood, Beneath her lofty window we repair'd, And, with the dulcet tinkling Mandolin, Beguil'd her of her rest. The father watch'd, And on my young associate fiercely sprang, Who, all unarm'd, was sinking to the ground. Montalva. So fell my gallant boy! and did he perish? Leonardo. Urg'd on to frenzy by this bold assault, I rush'd between them, sav'd the friend I lov'd, And smote the barb'rous ruffian on the breast: He fell, his own stiletto reach'd his heart! 'Twas a rash deed, but could I tamely see The dear companion of my youthful days Vanquish'd and murder'd by a villain's hand? Montalva. And did he wed the cause of your mishap? Leonardo. He did; and, to requite my honest zeal, Turn'd, like a serpent, on my fost'ring breast, And stung the heart that lov'd him! With fell rage, Threaten'd, himself, to be my base accuser, And spurn'd me from him like a guilty slave! Disgusted with the treach'ry of his soul, I fled; and from that fatal hour have been The solitary tenant of this cell, The scene of meditation, pray'r, and peace! Montalva. Curs'd be the villain, wheresoe'er he dwells! Leonardo. Oh! do not curse him; for he was—my brother! Montalva. Of noble birth, and yet so vile a soul! Leonardo. All outward semblance of attractive grace, Hereditary splendours, beauty, valour, Wit, learning, fancy, eloquence divine! Where godlike virtue dwells not in the soul, May feed upon the vapour, adulation, And boast an unsubstantial glitt'ring name, That dazzles only for a fleeting day. But innate glory shall outstrip the grave! And shine when all of pageantry and pride, Like the false meteors on the wings of night, Shall waste in empty air! Enter Honoria from the Hermitage. Montalva. Mysterious Heav'n! Honoria still alive! [Aside. Honoria. Hapless Montalva! whither bend thy way? I counsel thee to seek thy peaceful home, Nor thus pursue the phantom of revenge. Remember, he who can forgive his foe, Is nobler far than he that bids him die! We all can kill; and, vaunting our own strength, We crush the thing we hate; but can we give The spark that bids the meanest reptile breathe! Oh! did the pow'rful dare with impious rage To murder the defenceless, who, alas! Could look with rapture for to-morrow's dawn? Montalva. I go to seek the murderer of my son. Honoria. Then spare thy feeble age such thriftless toil; The murderer of thy son sleeps in the grave! He was as dear to this afflicted heart As Albert was to thine. Montalva. Misguided girl! Thy caution thinly veils the wretch thou lov'st; That villain, Alferenzi, was't not he? Honoria. Old man, I will not tell thee who it was; For, if his death will not appease thy wrath, Thou hast no Christian mercy in thy soul, And art not worth my pity! Alferenzi (speaking without.) Where is this cell, good fellow? Thou dost not give thy feet that willing zeal Which my impatience urges. Enter Alferenzi. Seeing Montalva and Honoria, he stops suddenly and amazed. Montalva! Hah! How is this? Am I at last betray'd? My feet seem rooted to this speck of earth, And guilty pangs convulse my tortur'd frame! Shake off thy blood-stain'd garb, my trembling soul, And let a brighter semblance cheat men's eyes. It will not be! I dare not meet their glance. Honoria (to Alferenzi, aside.) Thy crime is secret, as the will of Heav'n. Alferenzi (Montalva and Leonardo talk aside.) I cannot spurn this busy fiend away: Is this what men call conscience? Oh! 'tis hell! I am a wretch, a coward! Leave me, leave me. Montalva. Well may'st thou start, and tremble at my gaze, Thou homicide abhorr'd! now meet thy fate; 'Tis Albert's sword that strikes thee. [They fight. Honoria (rushing between them.) He did not kill thy son; the murd'rer was ? Montalva. Who? Honoria. My father! Marquis Valmont! Leonardo. My brother! Honoria. Oh! all ye hosts of Heav'n! Do I behold The venerable, noble Leonardo! Leonardo. Let my tears answer thee, before their source Is petrified with wonder! Oh! my child, Art thou the offspring of ill-fated Valmont? [Embracing Honoria. Montalva. Most injur'd Leonardo, Heav'n at length Has paid the recompense thy virtues claim'd. We will return to Valmont, where thy life Shall, like the sun that triumphs o'er the storm, Amidst resplendent glory sink to rest! Leonardo. Now let us, in my solitary cell, Refresh our weary spirits for a time; Then each shall tell his melancholy tale, And shed a kindly sympathetic tear, To wash away the traces of past woe! [Exeunt Montalva, Leonardo, Francisco, and the Peasant, into the Hermitage. Alferenzi. Ah! stay, Honoria! Do not leave me thus; Look up, my love, nor let affliction's shaft Bathe in the ruby current of thy heart. Time will wear out these dark corroding spots, And wing thy hours with joy! Honoria. Oh! Never! Never! Time, that with ceaseless labour can unfold The wondrous page of nature! that can lay The loftiest temples level with their base! Steal the soft graces of the fairest form, And, by the shadow of his restless wing, Eclipse the sun of intellectual light! Can bring no meliorating balm, to heal The wounded sense, where memory still lives! Day after day the cank'ring worm, reflection, Feeds on the with'ring fibres of the heart, And poisons all its hopes! Alferenzi. Where wouldst thou seek repose, oh! tell me, sweet? Honoria. In death! where he whose undelighted days Have been but tardy scenes of chequer'd woe, Assail'd by poverty, despair, and pain! On the same pillow lays his weary head Where kings must sleep, when earthly pow'r shall fade, And nature whispers, here thy journey ends! Alferenzi. Think not so deeply, love; oh! look upon me; Thy Alferenzi's fate is link'd with thine. Honoria. That I have lov'd thee, Heav'n can bear me witness, Beyond what truth can paint or fancy form! With thee I could have liv'd, and been content, Beneath some mountain hovel's rushy roof; Have shar'd the busy task of daily toil, And smil'd and sung the weary hours away! When gaudy Summer deck'd the glowing scene, I would have trimm'd our citadel of joy, Have call'd our humble meal a princely feast, Our myrtle bow'r a canopy of state! Or when stern Winter swept the frozen plain, And tumbling torrents drown'd the valley's pride, I would have crept, half trembling, to thy arms, And mock'd the howling of the midnight storm! But visionary scenes of joy are past; Horror and guilt assail where'er I turn, And all is anguish, frenzy, and despair! Alferenzi. Dress not thy fancy in such weeds of grief! Let hope and love enchant thee to repose. Honoria. Can love or hope restore a parent lost? Ah! little dost thou know the tender claims That bind in feath'ry spells each vagrant thought. Love should be gentle as the twilight breeze, And pure as early morn's ambrosial tears, Spangling the lily on the mountain's side. I cannot wed the murd'rer of my father! Alferenzi. Oh! do not call it murder! He whose life Pays the due forfeit to offended Heav'n, Having by outrage blurr'd his country's laws, Deserves that country's hate; and only falls To benefit her safety! Honoria. Yes; but when rigour, cherish'd by revenge, Treads on the heels of justice, thrusting back Humanity itself, the trembling scale Preponderates at will, and makes the deed Scarce less than legal murder! Be resign'd, Appease the wrath of Heav'n, and let me rest! [Exit into the Hermitage. Alferenzi. O Hope! inconstant as the summer gales That kiss the fragrant bosom of the rose, Thou shalt no more beguile me: I awake! Conviction tells me, in this wondrous mass, All joy is transient, and the fairest scenes Fraught with deception! Earth, air, seas; e'en man Deceives, while most he is himself deceiv'd, Glozing with smiles the hypocrite he hates! The flow'ry path we tread is sprinkled o'er With pois'nous weeds, and dews that threaten death. The skilful pilot ploughs his glitt'ring way, Nor fears the coming danger, till the deep, Black'ning and foaming, now a yawning gulph, And now a liquid mountain, swells with rage, And the gay gallant bark—is seen no more! The eagle grandly soars to greet the sun! Sweeps the bland concave with his lordly wing, And revels in the plenitude of day! Soon, on the viewless pinions of the storm, The rolling clouds obscure the beamy plains, Th' imprison'd lightnings break their sulphur bonds, And 'midst the blaze th' exulting tyrant dies! Oh! blissful termination of all ills! Ambrosial drop! that lingers in the dregs Of fate's embitter'd cup! oblivious death! Would I could taste thee, and forget my woes! But coward mis'ry clings to airy hope, Grasping from hour to hour a feeble chain, Which breaks at last, and hurls him to despair! [Exit. ACT V. SCENE XIV. The Front of an old Monastery; with a View of the Appennines at Sun-set. Enter Honoria. Honoria. Here, in this awful, this monastic gloom, I trust my weary soul will find repose! As late I stood upon the cavern'd cliff, List'ning the cat'ract's desolating roar, I mark'd the spires of this lone habitation Red with the lustre of the sinking sun! The solemn silence that surrounds these walls Well suits the shrine of holy meditation, And feasts the mind with luxury of thought. This is the goal where, faint with life's dull toil, The feeble woe-worn trav'ller stops, and smiles To know the busy hour of grief is past! For, after all, what is this fev'rous state? A transient day, of sun-shine and of storms; A path, bestrew'd with thorns and roseate wreathes; We journey on with hope, or lag with fear, Still, minute after minute, cheating time, Till, at the close, we stumble on the grave. [Light appears thro' the painted windows of the Chapel. It is the hour of vespers, which prepares The mind serene of virgin innocence For slumbers undisturb'd by ruthless care; Oh! apathy! thou kindly numbing pow'r! Thou opiate! rivalling the Theban drug, Lulling the nimble passions of the soul, And binding fast in sweet oblivious spells The wild rebellious fancy, here thou dwell'st! But I shall know thee not; my weary life Unfading memory presents before me, Dark as the clouds that shroud the coming storm! When will the day-star rise, that shall proclaim My morn eternal in the realms of bliss. [The gate opens. Constantia comes forward. Constantia. I heard the voice of mis'ry complaining, While at the holy altar of our saint! And Heav'n forbid the temple of religion Should e'er be shut against the child of woe! Honoria. Alas! I ask but little, rev'rend mother. Constantia. Make your request; I only wait your will. Honoria. A lonely speck of consecrated earth! A narrow pallet in the silent grave! Constantia. Have you no kindred to relieve your cares? Honoria. I had a father when the sun did rise! Constantia. And does he let thee wander thus forlorn? Where is he, gentle stranger? Honoria. He's in Heav'n! Is he in Heav'n?—Yes, yes; I hope he is! He was a very stern and rash old man; But still he was my father! He is gone! Cold drops of blood freeze on his silver hairs, Like the small flow'rs that peep thro' Alpine snow! Constantia. Holy Saint Peter! Was he murder'd, lady? Honoria (confused.) I fear he was: most sure I am he died! His cheek was pale, and petrified, and cold! But I entreat you let us change the matter, For 'tis a wounding subject; and, alas! I own I'm strangely wild when I do think on't! Constantia. Oh! my heart feels thy sorrows in its own; Like thee, sweet maid, in youth's exulting bloom, I found within these solitary walls A blest asylum from oppressive woe! My noble kindred long have mourn'd me lost; For since this awful sanctuary I sought No tidings have I sent to tell my fate. Honoria. Indeed! I pray you, do not count my youth Too apt and forward, if with curious speech I question you, How long in this deep gloom Your beauty has been shrouded from the world? Constantia. Just twenty summers, half my days of woe, Here have I pass'd sequester'd and unknown. So long has suff'rance borne affliction's thorn, Deep rankling in the breast of wedded love! Honoria. Of wedded love! art thou then married? Speak! Constantia. Oh! would I were not But th' omniscient pow'r, I trust, in pity, will, with tenfold joys, Requite my child for all her mother's wrongs! If yet she breathes, Heav'n show'r down blessings on her, And guide her thro' this wilderness of woe! Oh! could I once behold her ere I die, Could I but clasp her in my fond embrace, I would forgive her father's cruel scorn And bless the name of Valmont. Honoria. Oh! 'tis she! I am thy child! thy lov'd, thy lost Honoria! The hapless offspring of the murder'd Valmont. Constantia. Support me, Heav'n! [Faints. Honoria (supporting her.) What has my rashness done? Oh! do not leave me, angel! mother! Speak! Honoria calls thee! let not death's fell grasp Tear the fond parent from her long lost child! [Constantia revives. She lives! she breathes! Oh! cherish in thy heart The only comfort of thy widow'd days: [they embrace. We will, when fainting hope denies to cheer us, Mingle our tears, and smile at ruthless fate, In all the proudest luxury of woe! By day I'll strew thy lonely path with flow'rs, And all the live-long night thy slumbers watch, And chant my orisons for blessings on thee! Constantia. Alas! my child! such pious hopes are vain; Here must I stay for ever! Thou art born For gaudier scenes of splendour and delight! Honoria. Not for the globe's vast treasures would I leave thee! Thou shalt return to Valmont; to thy home; The noble Leonardo's close of life Will bloom a second spring of youth and joy, Blest in the converse of a saint like thee! Constantia. That cannot be; nor must thou here be known. My vows for ever bind me to this goal, Where, till my last funereal peal shall sound, My vesper pray'rs, my early matin songs, Must still confirm my solemn league with Heav'n. Thou art o'erwhelm'd with persecuting woe; Come, let me lead thee to the shrine of peace. Honoria. Oh! best of angels! Here will I remain; This venerable pile shall be our tomb, Where we will rest together! Moss-grown shrines, Approaching the gate. Where persecution shrinks from pity's gaze, And penitence prepares the soul for Heav'n, Oh! welcome to my dreary fev'rish soul! [Exeunt into the Monastery SCENE XV. A thick Wood. Night. The Convent's painted windows seen at a distance. Enter Alferenzi, meeting an old Peasant. Alferenzi. Well! hast thou found her? Ev'ry tangled dell, Each thorny labyrinth, and lonely glade, In vain I've search'd and travers'd o'er and o'er! I will not lose her so! What, like a coward, Yield up my hopes, and be the passive fool That fortune makes her plaything? All is still! The moping bat has wheel'd his circling flight, And hies him weary to his haunted home! No wand'ring insect winds his little horn To bid the drowsy traveller beware, While perilous oblivion grasps the scene! Oh! if I find her not, the gath'ring mists, That hasten round us on unwholesome wings, Will chill her gentle bosom— Peasant. Heav'n forefend! Lightning. 'Twill be a stormy hour. Oh! gracious Sir! In truth my heart is sorely wrung with pity; For countless are the dangers that beset The midnight wand'rer in these lonely haunts; Nor are the famish'd wolves that roam for prey More to be dreaded than the lawless swords Of merciless banditti! Alferenzi. I fear them not. [Thunder and lightning. Horrors on horrors crowd so thick upon me, That pall'd imagination, sick'ning, spurns The sanity of reason! man can but bear A certain portion of calamity; For when the pressure heap'd upon the brain O'erwhelms the active faculties of thought, The pang acute subsides, and leaves the mind A chaos wild of gorgeous desolation! Peasant. I hear the feet of passengers; their steps Give hollow signal on the sun-burnt ground. Alferenzi. Here, take this good stiletto, honest carle, And guard thy breast, if any ill should threaten. Enter two Robbers. First Robber. My poniard is prepared with mortal poison, And he that feels it dies. Lightning. [Alferenzi, perceiving the Robbers by the lightning. Cowards! assassins! [The Robbers assail Alferenzi and the Peasant. One is disarm'd by Alferenzi; the other, after piercing his side, escapes. Alferenzi. Ruffian! thou know'st thy life is in my pow'r; Now tell me, if in this sequestered gloom A beauteous lady met thee? quickly speak, Or thou shalt perish! Second Robber. Such a one I met, And saw her towards the convent bend her way; Yon light will guide you thither; she is safe. I could not harm the maid, she look'd so lovely! Alferenzi. Oh! Caitiff! if thou hadst, thy barb'rous soul Should in the lowest hell have howl'd for mercy! One act of virtue cancels all thy crimes; So take thy life; repent, for I forgive thee. [Exit Robber. How much more merciful this villain seems, Who on the instant gives the mortal wound, Than he who by oppression wrings the heart, And makes the wretch spin a long thread of life, Steep'd in perpetual tears! The storm is past; Thou know'st this convent! let us hasten thither. Peasant. Good noble youth, you faint; your voice doth faulter. Alferenzi. 'Tis but a trifle; 'twas the coward's sword That slightly pierc'd my side. Now lead the way; If I behold her angel face once more, Not all the demons of Despair shall part us. [Exeunt. SCENE XVI. The Chapel of the Convent. An altar, &amp;c. The corpse of Honoria on a bier in the middle of the aisle, covered with a white transparent pall, edged with black velvet. As the curtain rises slowly, the nuns, arranged round the chapel, sing a solemn dirge, beginning low, and rising to full chorus. That done, the first nun comes forward, and the other nuns arrange themselves in a semicircle that hides the bier. First Nun. Thus have we offer'd up our fervent pray'rs For the meek spirit of this beauteous maid. Her mien bespoke her noble; and her breast Seem'd the rich casket which contain'd a jewel Glowing with native and resplendent light! Ere from her fading lip the quiv'ring breath Fled its fair mansion, to my care she gave This costly picture: “Take it, pious sister, “Take it,” she cried, “and keep with holy awe “The once-lov'd image of my Alferenzi!” That done, she knelt, and rais'd her eyes to heav'n— Her piercing eyes—dark as her adverse fortune! Breath'd a short pray'r, and, like a spotless flow'r, Bow'd by the pitiless and pelting storm, Sunk to the earth, and died! [A loud knocking at the convent gate. Who knocks so loud? [Alferenzi rushes into the chapel, frantic, pale, and exhausted, followed by the old Peasant. Alferenzi. Oh! pious sisters, frown not on my rashness; I am a man the most accurs'd and wretched! Driv'n by the deadly storm of rending passions To this my last asylum! Have ye seen, Since ev'ning's star peer'd in the golden west, A drooping angel, agoniz'd with grief? More sweet than infant innocence, more pure Than sainted spirits journeying to the sky? [The nun turns from him. Speak; and, if pity dwells within your breast, Do not behold me perish! Nun (shewing the picture.) Know'st thou this? Alferenzi. Oh! I have found her, for exulting bliss Springs to my heart, and triumphs o'er despair! This is the proud meridian of my days, And my last glowing hour shall set in joy! Now, call her forth; tell her 'tis Alferenzi; She will, in pity, answer to the summons. [The nuns draw back on each side, discovering the bier; one of them throws the pall off the face of Honoria. Alferenzi (wildly.) Hah! Who has done this deed? Is that her wedding suit? How pale she looks! Soft; do not wake her; she is sick with sorrow; The priest is waiting, and the perfum'd bands Are gaily strew'd about the holy shrine; I mark'd the spangling drops that hung upon them; Some said that they were dying lovers' tears; Were they not right? Soft, soft; where am I? My senses much deceive me, or that corse, So beautiful in death, is Valmont's daughter! Enter Constantia. Constantia. Where is the wretch whose bold and impious rage Has dar'd profane the sacred rites of woe? Alferenzi. I came to seek the gem of this world's wonders! But she, too precious for this hated earth, Now beams a constellation in that heav'n Where I shall never see her! Oh! I lov'd her, Better, far better, than I lov'd my soul, For in her cause I gave it to perdition! Constantia. Ill-fated man! See in this faded form The wife of haughty Valmont; twenty years Have pass'd, in silent solitary grief, Since I beheld my persecuted child. Oh! my long-lost, my beautiful Honoria! My earliest comfort, and my last fond hope! I did not think to close thy eyes in death, Or bathe thy ashes with a mother's tears! [Kneels by the corpse of Honoria. Alferenzi. Is there on earth a wretch so curs'd as I? What is my crime, ye ministers of hell, That persecution, with a scorpion scourge, Should drive me to the precipice of fate? E'en there, the fiend will on the margin greet me, And, as I gaze upon the gulph below, Where mad revenge stands 'midst the foaming surge, And smiling feeds upon the hearts of men, Will snatch me back to linger in despair! Is there no yawning grave in the green ocean, No deadly venom in the teeming earth, No lightning treasur'd in the stagnant air, To end my weary pilgrimage of pain? Peasant. Tempt not the rage of heav'n with impious breath. Alferenzi (approaching the bier.) Yet let me look upon her: 'Twill not be! A burning torrent rushes thro' each nerve, And more than frenzy feeds upon my brain! The villain's sword was steep'd in mortal poison; Its course, tho' slow, each antidote defies: Now, now it freezes, and its icy thrill Checks the faint current of my with'ring heart! I thank thee, Caitiff; thou indeed wert kind! First Nun. Restore him, heav'n! Alferenzi. The fiends surround my soul! They are deceiv'd; My heart-strings will not break, for they have borne The miseries of love! Away! away! [falls. Let the same grave conceal our mould'ring ashes; And if the pilgrim, penitent and poor, Should drop a tear to consecrate the sod, I ask no other requiem! Death is kind; He flings his icy mantle o'er my sense, And shuts the scene of horror! Oh! farewell! [dies: First Nun. Farewell, sad victims of ambition's pow'r! Now let us raise to Heav'n our holy song, For the freed souls of these ill-fated lovers! While nature shrinks to contemplate the scene, And stern-eyed justice drops a silent tear, The angel Pity, bending from the sky, Shall draw the veil that hides their woes for ever! [They sing the dirge as the curtain falls, Constantia still kneeling by the bier. END OF VOL. I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. THE SAVAGE OF AVEYRON. 'Twas in the mazes of a wood, The lonely wood of Aveyron, I heard a melancholy tone:— It seem'd to freeze my blood! A torrent near was flowing fast, And hollow was the midnight blast As o'er the leafless woods it past, While terror-fraught I stood! O! mazy woods of Aveyron! O! wilds of dreary solitude! Amid thy thorny alleys rude I thought myself alone! I thought no living thing could be So weary of the world as me,— While on my winding path the pale moon shone. Sometimes the tone was loud and sad, And sometimes dulcet, faint, and slow; And then a tone of frantic woe: It almost made me mad. The burthen was “Alone! alone!” And then the heart did feebly groan;— Then suddenly a cheerful tone Proclaim'd a spirit glad! O! mazy woods of Aveyron! O! wilds of dreary solitude! Amid your thorny alleys rude I wish'd myself—a traveller alone. “Alone!” I heard the wild boy say,— And swift he climb'd a blasted oak; And there, while morning's herald woke, He watch'd the opening day. Yet dark and sunken was his eye, Like a lorn maniac's, wild and shy, And scowling like a winter sky, Without one beaming ray! Then, mazy woods of Aveyron! Then, wilds of dreary solitude! Amid thy thorny alleys rude I sigh'd to be—a traveller alone. “Alone, alone!” I heard him shriek, 'Twas like the shriek of dying man! And then to mutter he began,— But, O! he could not speak! I saw him point to Heav'n, and sigh, The big drop trembl'd in his eye; And slowly from the yellow sky, I saw the pale morn break. I saw the woods of Aveyron, Their wilds of dreary solitude: I mark'd their thorny alleys rude, And wish'd to be—a traveller alone! His hair was long and black, and he From infancy alone had been: For since his fifth year he had seen, None mark'd his destiny! No mortal ear had heard his groan, For him no beam of Hope had shone: While sad he sigh'd—“alone, alone!” Beneath the blasted tree. And then, O! woods of Aveyron, O! wilds of dreary solitude, Amid your thorny alleys rude I thought myself a traveller—alone. And now upon the blasted tree He carv'd three notches, broad and long, And all the while he sang a song— Of nature's melody! And though of words he nothing knew, And, though his dulcet tones were few, Across the yielding bark he drew, Deep sighing, notches three. O! mazy woods of Aveyron, O! wilds of dreary solitude, Amid your thorny alleys rude Upon this blasted oak no sun beam shone! And now he pointed one, two, three; Again he shriek'd with wild dismay; And now he paced the thorny way, Quitting the blasted tree. It was a dark December morn, The dew was frozen on the thorn: But to a wretch so sad, so lorn, All days alike would be! Yet, mazy woods of Aveyron, Yet, wilds of dreary solitude, Amid your frosty alleys rude I wish'd to be—a traveller alone. He follow'd me along the wood To a small grot his hands had made, Deep in a black rock's sullen shade, Beside a tumbling flood. Upon the earth I saw him spread Of wither'd leaves a narrow bed, Yellow as gold, and streak'd with red, They look'd like streaks of blood! Pull'd from the woods of Aveyron, And scatter'd o'er the solitude By midnight whirlwinds strong and rude, To pillow the scorch'd brain that throbb'd alone. Wild berries were his winter food, With them his sallow lip was dy'd; On chesnuts wild he fed beside, Steep'd in the foamy flood. Chequer'd with scars his breast was seen, Wounds streaming fresh with anguish keen, And marks where other wounds had been Torn by the brambles rude. Such was the boy of Aveyron, The tenant of that solitude, Where still, by misery unsubdued, He wander'd nine long winters, all alone. Before the step of his rude throne, The squirrel sported, tame and gay; The dormouse slept its life away, Nor heard his midnight groan. About his form a garb he wore, Ragged it was, and mark'd with gore, And yet, where'er 'twas folded o'er, Full many a spangle shone! Like little stars, O! Aveyron, They gleam'd amid thy solitude; Or like, along thy alleys rude, The summer dew-drops sparkling in the sun. It once had been a lady's vest, White as the whitest mountain's snow, Till ruffian hands had taught to flow The fountain of her breast! Remembrance bade the wild boy trace Her beauteous form, her angel face, Her eye that beam'd with Heavenly grace, Her fainting voice that blest,— When in the woods of Aveyron, Deep in their deepest solitude, Three barb'rous ruffians shed her blood, And mock'd, with cruel taunts, her dying groan. Remembrance trac'd the summer bright, When all the trees were fresh and green, When lost, the alleys long between, The lady past the night: She past the night, bewilder'd wild, She past it with her fearless child, Who raised his little arms, and smil'd To see the morning light. While in the woods of Aveyron, Beneath the broad oak's canopy, She mark'd aghast the ruffians three, Waiting to seize the traveller alone! Beneath the broad oak's canopy The lovely lady's bones were laid; But since that hour no breeze has play'd About the blasted tree! The leaves all wither'd ere the sun His next day's rapid course had run, And ere the summer day was done It winter seem'd to be: And still, O! woods of Aveyron, Amid thy dreary solitude The oak a sapless trunk has stood, To mark the spot where murder foul was done! From her the wild boy learn'd “alone,” She tried to say, my babe will die! But angels caught her parting sigh, The babe her dying tone. And from that hour the boy has been Lord of the solitary scene, Wand'ring the dreary shades between, Making his dismal moan! Till, mazy woods of Aveyron, Dark wilds of dreary solitude, Amid your thorny alleys rude I thought myself alone. And could a wretch more wretched be, More wild, or fancy-fraught than he, Whose melancholy tale would pierce an heart of stone. SIR RAYMOND OF THE CASTLE. A TALE. The following little Poems are written after the Model of the Old English Ballads, and are inscribed to those who admire the simplicity of that kind of versification. Near Glaris, on a mountain's side, Beneath a shad'wy wood, With walls of ivy compass'd round, An ancient Castle stood. By all rever'd, by all ador'd, There dwelt a wealthy dame; One peerless daughter bless'd her age, A maid of spotless fame. While one fair son, a gallant boy, Whose virtue was his shield, Led on the dauntless sons of war, Amidst the crimson'd field: For o'er the land dissension reign'd Full many a direful year, And many a heart's best blood had stain'd The proud oppressor's spear. Young Ella's charms had spread her fame O'er all the country wide; And youths of high descent and brave Had sought her for their bride. To win her love Sir Raymond came, Sprung from a princely race; Right valiant in each warlike art, And blest with ev'ry grace. In tournaments renown'd afar, For manly feats admir'd; His brilliant fame, his bold exploits, The damsel's bosom fir'd. Her blushing cheek, her down-cast eye, Her secret flame confess'd; The gallant Raymond's circling arm The beauteous Ella press'd. From her fond mother's doating eyes The radiant gem he bore; The weeping maids and village swains Beheld her charms no more. Where the swift billows of the Rhine Their shining curls disclose, With many a gilded turret crown'd, His splendid Palace rose. The festive scene had scarce began, When near the Castle wall A messenger of warlike mien On Raymond's name did call. “Come forth, thou valiant Knight,” he said, “Thy prowess quickly show, With speed prepare thy lance and shield To meet the dauntless foe: “The blood of many a noble Swiss Doth stain the country round, And many a brave aspiring youth Lies vanquished on the ground. “The daring Chief, whose shining spear With purple gore is dy'd, Oh! direful news, prepare to meet The brother of thy bride.” Enrag'd, the haughty Raymond cried, “Base wretch, receive thy doom! For thy bold errand thou shalt die Within a dungeon's gloom.” Speechless the mournful Ella stood, Despair her heart did wound, When from the echoing tow'r she heard The trumpet's dreadful sound. Her cold wan cheek, her quiv'ring lip, Bespoke her soul's deep woe, From her blue eye the crystal drop In silent grief did flow. “For shame! shake off those woman's tears,” The frowning bridegroom cried, “And know, Sir Raymond's warlike breast Disdains a timid bride. “In vain you weep, ignoble dame; Behold yon neighing steed; My soldiers wait, my bosom burns To conquer or to bleed.” Forth went the Knight:—the frantic bride To the high rampart flew; With trembling heart she climb'd the wall, Th' embattled plain to view. On either side, by turns she thought Proud vict'ry grac'd the field; Till vanquish'd by her brother's sword, She saw her husband yield. For refuge to his Castle gate The bleeding warrior flew; And from the battlements on high His daring gauntlet threw. Three days from dawn to setting sun The hardy soldiers stood, 'Till faint with toil, by famine press'd, They saw their chief subdu'd. “Oh! haste my page,” Sir Raymond said, “The captive youth set free, And bid him to the conqu'ror's feet This message bear from me. “Treasures immense of massy gold, Rich gems and jewels rare, As ransom will I freely give, If he our lives will spare. “If he consents, let garlands green Thy peaceful brows adorn; If hostile yet, beneath our walls, Thrice sound thy bugle-horn.” Gaily he pass'd the outward gate; But sadly he return'd; His bugle-horn he sounded thrice, No wreath his brows adorn'd. “Thy gold,” he cried, “the conqu'ror scorns, He claims thy forfeit life, Thy precious gems, and jewels rare, He gives thy beauteous wife. “Your lands are free, your soldiers too, And for young Ella's sake, To prove his truth, the gen'rous chief This solemn vow did make. “That whatsoe'er she holds most dear, At morrow's dawn of day, Her pages to some distant place May safely bear away.” At dawn of light fair Ella came, Fresh as the rose of May; Sir Raymond in a chest of gold Her pages bore away! She pass'd the gate with throbbing heart, She pass'd the ranks among; The praises of her peerless charms Fell fast from ev'ry tongue. “Halt, halt!” they cried, “right noble dame, 'Tis fit we should behold Whether thy coffer ought contains But gems and massy gold.” “O stay me not, ye gallant youths, For soon it shall appear This burnish'd coffer doth contain All that I hold most dear! “Take heed, my Brother, ah, take heed, Nor break thy sacred word; Nor let thy kinsman's blood degrade The glories of thy sword!” The Hero smil'd—fair Ella's cheek Glow'd with vermilion dye; Fear chill'd her heart, the starting tear Stood trembling in her eye. Subdu'd, abash'd, her brother flew And snatch'd her to his breast, Then with an angel's pitying voice, The vanquish'd chief address'd: “Come forth, Sir Raymond, valiant knight, Behold thy peerless wife; Receive thy sword, and from her hand Accept thy forfeit life. “Here shall the bloody contest end, Let peace o'erspread the land; More homage than the conqueror's sword Can beauty's tears command!” DONALD AND MARY. On Scotia's Hills a gentle Maid, The fairest of the rustic throng, When round the glitt'ring Moon-beams play'd, Oft pour'd her sad and plaintive song: Her eye was dimm'd with sorrow's tears, Which from their azure fountain roll'd; Her throbbing heart was fraught with fears; Pale was her cheek, and deadly cold! By Friends forgot, by Foes oppress'd, By Fortune's chilling frown subdu'd, Fierce Frenzy hover'd o'er her breast, And wither'd Grief her steps pursu'd: But, ah! more fatal e'en than those; The worst of pangs 'twas hers to share; While Envy, smiling, mock'd her woes— For Envy feeds on human care. A gallant Youth, of Scottish birth, Had woo'd and won the gentle maid; Not all the treasur'd gems of earth Like Donald's music could persuade; Not all that India's shores supply, Or all the wealth of Britain's Isle, Could charm like Donald's speaking eye, Or win the soul like Donald's smile. But Glory, lifting high her crest, His glowing fancy lur'd to arms; Fame filled his young and panting breast— He left his Mary's world of charms. Ill-fated Donald fought and bled! The green sod veil'd his manly form, While round his dark and clay-cold bed Bleak blew the wild and wint'ry storm. No marble trophies deck'd the spot, To ask the pensive trav'ler's sigh; No verse to tell his hapless lot, Or bid the valiant learn to die. But there the Snow-drop, meek and pale, With Morning's tears would oft o'erflow; And there the Bird of Sorrow's tale Repeated Mary's tender woe. “Ah! who has seen my gallant Boy, In martial trim, and rich array? Ah! who has heard my only joy Sing to yon Moon his roundelay? His laurel shines in yonder sky, The brightest of the starry train; Though in the grave his beauties lie, All crimson'd o'er with many a stain. “Ah! have you seen my Donald brave, Enthron'd on yonder passing cloud? Or gliding o'er yon whitening wave, Or chaunting, 'midst the tempest loud? Now, o'er yon hill the day-star peeps, The merry birds awake to glee; Low in the grave my Donald sleeps, Nor hears their song, nor thinks of me! “Give me his sword, of mickle fame, And give me too, his bonnet gay; On the green-turf to carve his name, And decorate his hallow'd clay. Ye costly graves, where Monarchs lie, With Crowns and Sceptres, won by birth; Vainly your glitt'ring baubles vie With Donald's Sword, and Donald's Worth! By weeping Evening's fading light, Far o'er the thistled heath she stray'd, Till, lost amidst the frowns of night, The cold blast chill'd the beauteous maid: Along the dreary, desart gloom Her mournful song was heard to glide; “With joy,” she said, “I meet my doom!” Then sigh'd her Donald's name—and died! LLWHEN AND GWYNETH. WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1782. “When will my troubled soul have rest?” The blue-eyed Llwhen cried; As thro' the murky shade of night With frantic step she hied. “When shall those eyes my Gwyneth's face, My Gwyneth's form survey? When shall those longing eyes again Behold the dawn of day? “Cold are the dews that wet my cheek, The night-mist damps the ground; Appalling echoes strike mine ear, And spectres gleam around. “The vivid lightning's transient rays Around my temples play; 'Tis all the light my fate affords To mark my thorny way. “From the black mountain's awful height, Where Llathryth's turrets rise, The dark owl screams a direful song, And warns me as she flies. “The chilling blast, the whistling winds, The mould'ring ramparts shake; The hungry tenants of the wood Their cavern'd haunts forsake. “My trembling limbs, unus'd to stray Beyond a father's door, Full many a mile have journeyed forth, Each footstep mark'd with gore. “No costly sandals deck my feet, By thorns and briars torn; The cold rain chills my rosy cheek, Whose freshness sham'd the morn. “Slow steals the life-stream at my heart, Dark clouds o'ershade my eyes; Foreboding sorrow tells my soul My captive Hero dies. “Yet if one gentle ray of hope Can sooth the soul to rest, Oh! may it pierce yon flinty tow'r, And warm my Gwyneth's breast. “And if soft pity's tearful eye A Tyrant's heart can move, Ill-fated Llwhen yet may live To clasp her vanquished Love. “And tho' stern war with bonds of steel His graceful form shall bind, No earthly spell has pow'r to hold The freedom of his mind. “And tho' his warm and gallant heart Now yields to fate's decree, Its feelings spurn the base constraint, And fly to love and me! “Then, Banworth, Lion of the field! O, hear a maiden plead; Sheath not thy sword in Gwyneth's breast, Or too, let Llwhen bleed! “To valiant feats of arms renown'd Shall earthly praise be giv'n; But deeds of mercy, mighty Chief, Are register'd in Heav'n! “The minstrels' song of praise shall fill The Palace of thy foe; While down the joyful Llwhen's cheek The grateful tear shall flow. “And sure the tear that Virtue sheds Some rapture can impart; What gem can deck a victor's throne Like incense from the heart?” Now the grey Morning's silv'ry light, Dawn'd in the eastern skies, When at the lofty lattice grate Her Lover's form she spies. “He lives!” she cried, “My Gwyneth lives! Youth of the crimson shield! The graceful Hero of my heart, The glory of the field! “Come down, my soul's delight!” she said, “Thy blue-eyed Llwhen see; Yrganvy's Daughter, thy true Love, Who only breathes for thee: “Then haste thee from thy prison house, Ere yet the Foe doth rise! Oh! haste ere yet the Morning Sun Doth flame along the skies. “Ah, speak! my heart is chill'd with fear, My fault'ring voice doth fail; Why are thy darling eyes so dim, Thy cheeks so deathly pale?” “I am thy Gwyneth's Ghost, sweet maid, Avoid the madd'ning sight; Those eyes that doated on thy charms Are clos'd in endless night. “This loyal heart, which beat for thee, Is rent with many a wound; Cleft is my shield, my glitt'ring spear Lies broke on Monia's ground. “My bones the eagle hath convey'd To feed her rav'nous brood; The black-brow'd Banworth's savage hand Hath spilt my purple blood. “Then hie thee hence, ill-fated maid, Ere greater woes betide, To where Teivi's silver streams Along the vallies glide. “There, where the modest primrose blooms, Pale as thy lover's shade, My mangled relics shalt thou find Upon the green turf laid. “Then hie thee hence, with holy hands Build up a sacred shrine, And oh! chaste maid, thy faith to prove, Unite thy dust with mine!” Ah! have you seen a mother's joy In cherub sweetness dress'd, Seiz'd by the numbing hand of death, Expiring at her breast? Or the fond maid, whom morrow's dawn Had hail'd a wedded fair, Doom'd to behold her lover's corse Scorch'd by the lightning's glare? So stood the hopeless, frantic maid, Yrganvy's graceful child, Cold was her cheek, her dove-like eyes Fix'd in amazement wild! “This panting heart,” at length she cried, “A sharper pang doth feel Than thine, brave youth, when rent in twain By Banworth's poison'd steel. “No more these sad and weeping eyes My father's house shall see; To airy halls, from Mona's hill, I haste to follow thee. “Beside thy tomb the Chieftain's tear Shall join the foamy surge; And oft upon the desert heath The Druid chaunt thy dirge. “The weary Trav'ller, faint and sad, Shall stay his steps awhile; The memory of his own hard fate Thy story shall beguile. “There, wet with many a holy tear, The sweetest buds shall blow, There Llwhen's ghost shall mark the shrine, A monument of woe!” Thrice did he ope the lattice grate, And thrice he bade adieu; When, lo! to join the parting shade, The maiden's spirit flew! ANSELMO, THE HERMIT OF THE ALPS. Where, mingling with Helvetia's skies, The snow-clad mountains glitt'ring rise; Far from the din of busy life, From specious fraud, and envious strife; From trivial joys, and empty show, And all the taunting tribes of woe; Deep in a forest's silent shade, For holy Meditation made, Anselmo liv'd!—his humble shed Rear'd, 'midst the gloom, its rushy head. Full many a flow'r, of loveliest hue, Around his mossy threshold grew: His little vineyard food supply'd, His healthful cup the rippling tide; The wood his tranquil bow'r of noon, His midnight lamp the silv'ry moon; His simple garb and modest mien, The emblems of the soul within. Lost to the world, by all forgot, No envious fiend assail'd his cot; His matin pray'r, his ev'ning song, Proclaim'd a conscience void of wrong; While, with a pure and feeling mind, He wept the woes of human kind. For when the young Anselmo try'd The paths of luxury and pride, He found in every gaudy scene Light Vanity, with wanton mien, And base Self-Interest, grov'ling guest, And Envy with deep-wounded breast, And Pow'r that spurn'd the hapless race, And Splendour gilding o'er disgrace; And bold Oppression's pond'rous chain, To load the groaning Sons of Pain! Anselmo's heart, with virtue stor'd, Disgusted every path explor'd; For still in each a thorn he found, Whose hidden point was sure to wound: Friends murd'ring with a specious smile, And kindred bosoms fraught with guile; And reptiles who, in baseness bold, Unblushing barter'd love for gold! Blest might have been his lot obscure! What cannot patient worth endure? But, ah! within his feeling heart, Long-cherish'd Passion fix'd its dart, And, braving Reason's pow'rful aid, Had bid his cheeks bright crimson fade. With every mental joy at strife, Its poisons dash'd the sweets of life; Brought Discontent, and all her train, To wring his soul with ceaseless pain, Each morn with clouds to cross his way, To haunt his path at sinking day; And when his midnight couch he press'd, With weedy mischiefs sting his breast. Despairing, lost, perplex'd to find No balm to heal his tortur'd mind; At early dawn, at twilight's close, Still wounding thought deny'd repose. In vain, to quit the maid ador'd, Anselmo solitude explor'd: For e'en amidst the glooms around Her peerless beauty still he found. In every rose her blushing cheek Seem'd with resistless grace to speak; The lily fair, in perfumes drest, Pourtray'd her spotless fragrant breast; The stream, reflecting back the sky, Brought to his mind her azure eye; The sun, in amber lustre roll'd, Glow'd like her locks of silky gold; The lonely turtle's plaintive moan Recall'd her song's celestial tone; And ev'ry dew-drop, trembling near, Gave to his soul—her parting tear! Oh! fatal hour, when friends severe Beheld unmov'd that parting tear, When, vanquish'd by the sordid crew, Anselmo bade the world adieu; When, bow'd to rigid duty's sway, He saw his fairest hopes decay, His short-liv'd visions of delight O'erwhelm'd, and lost in endless night. Once more in search of peace to roam, Anselmo left his hermit's home: For three long years had bid him prove That absence cannot conquer love; That in the breast where passion burns, Each nerve officious reason spurns; Though in the gulph of mis'ry cast, It loves to ponder on the past; While Mem'ry, with a keener sense, Still paints the eye's soft eloquence, Still marks the blush of feeling meek, Still whispers more than words can speak, Still bids tumultuous throbbings prove That language was not made for love! Still Fancy cheats the wounded breast, With momentary raptures blest; And, e'en when Hope denies relief, Reflection feeds the source of grief. “Perish the thought!” Anselmo cry'd, “That hearts, by mutual vows ally'd, Should passive crouch to tyrant pow'r, And dark'ning youth's effulgent hour, Sink in oblivion's whelming tide, The victims of insatiate pride! “Perish the thought, that genuine fires Should fading yield to low desires; That those who cannot, dare not, prove The sweet vicissitudes of love, Should by the spells of paltry gold The Child of Worth in thraldom hold, And, dead'ning all the thrills of soul, Bend Nature to their stern controul. “Shall man o'er man a tyrant prove, And Fortune guide the shafts of Love? Shall those, by Heav'n's own influence join'd, By feeling, sympathy, and mind, The sacred voice of truth deny, And mock the mandate of the sky? Shall the proud breast, with virtue stor'd, Bow like the vassal to his lord, And, prodigal of life's short day, In base submission fade away? Then sink unpitied to the grave, A wretch abhor'd!—a willing slave!” Rous'd from his dream, the hermit sought The scene once more, with mis'ry fraught; Clad in a pilgrim's mean array, From morn's approach till parting day The toilsome thorny path he trod, No guide but Hope,—no friend but God! And when the shades of night o'erspread The misty mountain's breezy head, Exhausted, on earth's humid breast, He kiss'd his cross, and sunk to rest. At length, his weary weeping eyes With joy beheld the day-star rise: For morning gave his raptur'd sight The long-lost scene of fond delight, Where gentle Rosa, peerless maid! Once like a sun illum'd the shade; Or, as the jewel gilds the mine, Bade dazzling lustre round her shine. How throbb'd Anselmo's heart, when near, The well-known vespers hail'd his ear! How did he watch declining day, How pant to greet its parting ray! For welcome to the lover's sight Appear the murky shades of night; And sacred every haunt must prove, That hides the timid blush of love. Now Hope inspir'd his bleeding breast— Now Fear each thrilling joy suppress'd,— While to his Rosa's proud abode Forlorn Anselmo sought the road, And near her lofty window crept, When all her sordid kindred slept; While the chaste moon, with pitying light, Stole veil'd across the dome of night, And ev'ry zephyr, wand'ring near, Kiss'd from his cheek a sacred tear. “Come, Rosa fair!” the Hermit said, “Bright star of beauty, chear the shade! Anselmo calls!—ere rising day Exulting spreads its envious ray, Beam comfort on my dark despair, Light of my life, my Rosa fair!” Yet all was silent, all was drear, Anselmo's soul was chill'd with fear! The sun rush'd forth, his beamy gold Around the misty mountain roll'd: The landscape glow'd with colours gay, New gilded by the eastern ray; While ev'ry blossom trembling near Dropp'd from its leaves a chrystal tear, And seem'd, by sympathy, to show That Nature weeps a lover's woe! Fear bade Anselmo's feet depart, While anguish wrung his burning heart; With devious step he sought the wood, Where, ivy-crown'd, a convent stood; Where many a young and noble maid, Like a fair flowret doom'd to fade, In Superstition's mournful gloom, A weeping angel-grac'd a tomb! Anselmo now, with throbbing breast, Approach'd the shrine of fancied rest: With trembling touch the latch he rais'd, Then, kneeling, cross'd his brow, and prais'd! The gate on creaking hinges mov'd, And loud his daring hand reprov'd. While through the cloister drear he pass'd, Cold blew the whistling northern blast; The turrets tott'ring o'er his head, Shook his faint soul with conscious dread; Till by the taper's quiv'ring ray To the long aisle he bent his way, Where, chaunting o'er a sable bier, Begem'd with many a holy tear, The white-rob'd virgins kneeling paid Sad tribute to a sister's shade! Anselmo's garb, and downcast look, A Pilgrim's penitence bespoke! Though sorrow mark'd his manly face, His eye retain'd celestial grace. A welcome guest, he join'd the throng, The sacred rites, the Heav'nly song! Till bending o'er the fun'ral bed, The consecrated oil to shed, He started back in wild amaze, Death-wounded by the fatal gaze! For there his darling maid he found, And, madd'ning at the sight, fell lifeless to the ground! BOSWORTH FIELD. Gliding o'er the moonlight heath, Mark the shad'wy tribes of Death! Hark! their airy voices say, “Haste thee, Mortal! haste away! “While our clashing halberts bright Glisten by the lamp of night; While our hosts, in hostile pride, O'er the thistled desart glide; “Soon shall turbid clouds absorb Spectred midnight's paly Orb! Soon shall Horror grasp its ray:— Wand'ring Mortal, haste away! “Chilly blows the northern blast; Deadly dews are rising fast; Quit, oh! quit this haunted heath, Sacred to the tribes of Death! “Screech-owls warn thee of thy fate, Fly thee, ere it be too late! All is sad, and all is drear, Wherefore, mortal, wander here?” All is silent!—yon black cloud Soon the waning Moon will shroud: All is dark!—the moaning wind Turbid vapours haste to bind. Now the sev'ring skies again Chear with light the spangled plain: Now low murmurs sadly say, “Stay thee, gentle wand'rer, stay.” What art thou, slow gliding by, With snowy robe, and glaring eye? Quickly fleeting shadow, say Whither wouldst thou bend thy way? Why invite my steps along To yon pale and warlike throng? Wherefore wave thy lily hand, Beck'ning back the ghastly band? “Stranger, hear my mournful strain, Ere the day-star gilds the plain; Ere the rosy beams of light Bid me fade from mortal sight! “This is Bosworth's fatal field, Plough'd with many a shatter'd shield! This is Bosworth's silent grave Of chieftains bold, and bowmen brave! “Here the flow'r of England's pride, Wading through a purple tide, Forc'd the ranks the tyrant led O'er the heaps of mighty dead! “While, amidst a sea of blood, Norfolk! Oxford! Pembroke! stood; England's bane, and England's boast, Rush'd to arms,—a dauntless host! “Yonder valiant Richmond's breast Onward to the tyrant press'd! Yonder, mad with many a wound, Hellish Richard gnaw'd the ground! “See his faulchion deep embu'd With valiant Brandon's vital blood; See its crimson'd fragments glare Hideous through the stagnant air! “Start not, Mortal!—Hear my tale: See my cheek so deadly pale, Once the fairest freshest flow'r, Plac'd by Heav'n in Leicester's bow'r. “Peerless Bertha was my name, First in beauty, first in fame! Gallant Hubert was my pride: Hubert fell, and Bertha died! “Ermin'd robe and tissu'd vest Never more shall wrap this breast; Now my death-bed trappings view, Pale and gem'd with frozen dew! “Perfect was my Hubert's mind, Train'd to arms, by love refin'd! Speaking was his hazle eye, Smooth his cheek, of ruddy dye. “Raven black his glossy hair, Shading o'er his forehead fair: Night's impervious curtains so Veil the mountain's spotless snow! “Onward rush'd his palfry white, Deck'd with silver bosses bright; Bosses, doom'd their rays to shed O'er my Hubert's funeral bed! “O'er his golden helmet gay Gaudy plumage fann'd the day: Hapless plumes! ye wave no more, Hubert's crest is drench'd in gore! “When the battle's fierce alarms Lur'd my hero from my arms, Who my parting throb can tell? Who, but those that love as well? “But, when o'er the tented heath Horror wing'd the lance of Death; When my gallant Hubert fell, None, alas! my woes can tell. “Three short moons beheld me rave O'er my mangled lover's grave! Countless moons shall see my ghost Hov'ring near yon shad'wy host! “Nightly will I glide along Near the vast terrific throng! Nightly shall my mournful strain Echo o'er this haunted plain! “For, perchance, amidst the throng Hubert's shade shall catch the song; Though a strain of rending woe, Hubert Bertha's strain will know! “Then, my love again may join Tender sighs and plaints to mine; Or to some more peaceful shore We may glide, to part no more! “See, the yellow dawn appears! Gentle wand'rer, check thy tears: See, my shadow shuns the day! Haste thee, mortal, haste away!” THE DOUBLET OF GREY. Beneath the tall turrets that nod o'er the dell, A dark forest now blackens the mound; Where often, at dawn-light, the deep-sounding bell Tolls sadly and solemn a soul-parting knell, While the ruin re-echoes the sound. Yet long has the castle been left to decay, For its ramparts are skirted with thorn; And no one by moonlight will venture that way, Lest they meet the poor maid, in her doublet of grey, As she wanders, all pale and forlorn! “And why should she wander? O tell me, I pray, And, oh! why does she wander alone?” Beneath the dark ivy, now left to decay, With no shroud, but a coarse simple doublet of grey, Lies her bosom as cold as a stone. Time was when no form was so fresh, or so fair, Or so comely, when richly array'd: She was tall, and the jewels that blaz'd in her hair Could no more with her eye's living lustre compare, Than a rose with the cheek of the maid. She lov'd!—but the youth, who had vanquish'd her heart, Was the heir of a peasant's hard toil; For no treasure had he: yet, a stranger to art, He would oft by a look to the damsel impart What the damsel receiv'd with a smile. Whene'er to the wake or the chace she would go, The young Theodore loiter'd that way; Did the sun-beams of summer invitingly glow, Or across the bleak common the winter winds blow, Still he watch'd till the closing of day. Her parents so wealthy, her kindred so proud, Heard the story of love with dismay; They rav'd, and they storm'd, by the Virgin they vow'd, That, before they would see her so wedded, a shroud Should be Madeline's bridal array. One night, it was winter, all dreary and cold, And the moon-beams shone paly and clear; When she open'd her lattice, in hopes to behold Her Theodore's form, when the turret-bell toll'd, And the blood in her heart froze with fear. Near the green-mantled moat her stern father she spied, And a grave he was making with speed; The light, which all silver'd the castle's strong side, Display'd his wild gestures, while madly he cry'd— “Cursed caitiff! thy bosom shall bleed!” Distracted, forlorn, from the castle of pride, She escap'd at the next close of day: Her soft blushing cheek with dark berries all dy'd, With a spear on her shoulder, a sword by her side, And her form in a doublet of grey. She travers'd the courts, not a vassal was seen, Through the gate, hung with ivy, she flew: The sky was unclouded, the air was serene, The moon shot its rays, the long vistas between, And her doublet was spangled with dew. O'er the cold breezy downs to the hamlet she hied, Where the cottage of Theodore stood; For its low roof of rushes she oft had descried, When she drank of the brook that foam'd wild by its side, While the keen hunters travers'd the wood. The sky on a sudden grew dark, and the wind, With a deep sullen murmur, rush'd by; She wander'd about, but no path could she find, While horrors on horrors encompass'd her mind When she found that no shelter was nigh. And now, on the dry wither'd fern, she cou'd hear The hoofs of swift horses rebound; She stopp'd and she listen'd, she trembled with fear, When a voice most prophetic and sad met her ear, And she shudder'd and shrunk at the sound. “'Tis here we will wait,” cry'd the horseman; for see How the moon with black clouds is o'erspread; No hut yields a shelter, no forest a tree— This heath shall young Theodore's bridal-couch be, And the cold earth shall pillow his head. “Hark! some one approaches:—now stand we aside, We shall know him—for see, the moon's clear; In a doublet of grey he now waits for his bride, But, ere dawn-light, the carle shall repent of his pride, And his pale mangled body rest here.” Again, the moon shrouded in clouds, o'er the plain The horsemen were scatter'd far wide; The night became stormy, the fast falling rain Beat hard on her bosom, which dar'd not complain, And the torrent roll'd swift by her side. Now clashing of swords overwhelm'd her with dread, While her ear met the deep groan of death; “Yield, yield thee, bold peasant,” the murderer said, “This turf with thy heart's dearest blood shall be red, And thy bones whiten over the heath.” Now shrieking, despairing, she starts from the ground, And her spear, with new strength, she lets go: She aim'd it at random, she felt it rebound From the sure hand of Fate, which inflicted the wound, As it drank the life-blood of her foe. The morning advanced, o'er the pale chilling skies Soon the warm rosy tints circled wide; But, oh God! with what anguish, what terror she flies, When her father, all cover'd with wounds, she descries With her lover's pale corpse by his side! Half frantic she fell on her parent's cold breast, And she bath'd her white bosom with gore; Then, in anguish the form of young Theodore press'd— “I will yet be thy bride, in the grave we will rest,” She exclaim'd; and she suffer'd no more. Now o'er the wild heath when the winter winds blow, And the moon-silver'd fern branches wave, Pale Theodore's spectre is seen gliding slow, As he calls on the damsel in accents of woe, Till the bell warns him back to his grave. And while the deep sound echoes over the wood, Now the villagers shrink with dismay; For, as legends declare, where the castle once stood, 'Mid the ruins, by moonlight, all cover'd with blood, Shrieks the maid—in her doublet of grey! THE FOSTER-CHILD. IN IMITATION OF SPENSER. CANTO I. 'Mid Cambria's hills a lowly cottage stood, Circled with mossy tufts of sombre green; A vagrant brook flow'd wildly thro' the wood, Flashing in lucid lapse the shades between; And, cloth'd in mist, a distant hut was seen: A village spire above the copse rose white; And oft, when summer clos'd the day serene, The broad horizon glisten'd golden-bright, Beskirted here and there with purple-tinted light. Close by the river's marge a ruin stands, Which time for ages taught to moulder slow; And there, as legends tell, the Druid bands To Snowden's summit rais'd the dirge of woe, Whene'er the warriors' blood was bade to flow: And when the yellow dawn, with weeping eye, Above the ivy'd battlements 'gan glow, From the black tow'rs their fading ghosts would cry, 'Till the wide gates of day flam'd in the eastern sky. And there the minstrel's airy harp would sound, In soft vibrations musically sad; And there a stream of light would quiver 'round, While spectres gleam'd, in shroudy vestments clad; And many, hearing their loud shrieks, grew mad! And still the little cot was cheerful seen; And the poor foster-mother, smiling, glad That pride and pomp had ne'er her portion been, But all her nights and days pass'd on in peace serene. Sprung from a race obscure, she little knew The many snares that lurk in paths of state: She, mountain-cherish'd with the guileless few, Nor fear'd the cunning nor obey'd the great; Her bosom tranquil, and her soul elate! She from soft slumbers merrily awoke Ere morn with humid fingers op'd her gate; And listen'd, cheerful, while the woodman's stroke Levell'd the loftiest pine, or cleft the proudest oak. And happy had the foster-mother been, But that her wedded mate was old and poor; Tho' as no splendid days the pair had seen, They envied not the rich their shining store, The costly banquet, nor the marble floor. Pleas'd with her toil, the nurse of lusty Health, She found contentment, and she sought no more; While Time, which conquers e'en the brave by stealth, Scatter'd 'mid Folly's train the miseries of wealth. Full sixty summers had old Owen seen, And now his hair grew whiter ev'ry day; And he, who once a sturdy hind had been, Now found his strength was wasting quick away, While creeping Palsy shook his feeble clay; And now came Discontent, with pining mien, And eager Avarice, which, gossips say, Is age's bitter curse; and so, I ween, Old Owen found the hag, the nurse of envious spleen. And now he hobbled through the splashy lane, While the night-breeze his weary bones would shake; And now the mountain's summit to attain He panted loud, as tho' his heart would break, And sorely did his limbs begin to ache: And when the snow was drifted, or the rain Swell'd the small rivulet to foaming rage, He felt the chilling mist in every vein, And, like a wounded deer, droop'd languid o'er the plain. And sometimes to the ruin he would hie, And there, upon a mossy fragment, wait, Watching the red blaze of the ev'ning sky, Gilding with flaming gold the roofs of state, The fretted column, and the trophied gate: And thus he ponder'd on the wrecks of Time, While o'er his head the bird of gloom would cry, And all around the black'ning ivy climb, Shadowing the sacred Haunts of Solitude sublime. And then the varying destiny of Man Employ'd his thoughts till twilight's veil was spread; And much he murmur'd at the chequer'd plan, And many a tear, repining sore, he shed; And now in mute reflection bow'd his head, With arms enwoven, and with downcast eyes, The page of human misery he read, Where Wealth for Honesty its thralment tries While at Oppression's feet the child of Virtue dies. Then fancy led him to the battle's rage, Where flush'd Ambition rear'd its sanguine crest, Where men with men, like tigers, fierce engage, The brother's sword against the brother's breast: And then he rais'd his eyes to heav'n, and bless'd; For blood had never stain'd his trembling hand, But holy Innocence, by Pity drest, Spurning the pride of insolent command, Had nerv'd his shuddering heart to scorn th' oppressor's brand. Thus did he ruminate; while many a tale Told by the gabbling gossips of the plain, O'er his lean cheek diffus'd a deadly pale, Bidding him seek his cheerful home again: Now fancy bade him ken the warrior train Winding the mazes of the merry dance, With pages silken-clad, and ladies vain, And banners thickly pierc'd with many a lance, And palfries milky-white, that champing loud did prance; While airy harps, by sainted Druids smote, Pour'd the soft cadence from their golden strings; And groans of murder'd chieftains seem'd to float O'er Cambria's tow'ring pride, on Echo's wings: And now the gushing of a thousand springs Call'd forth the elfin tribes, in dew bedight; And now the vaulted arch with clamors rings; And starry eyes, spangling the face of Night, Seem'd thro' the murky gloom to shed translucent light. Now Owen, rising from his moss-clad seat, Thro' the lone forest bent his silent way; And faint the pulses of his bosom beat, Till, peering calm and clear, the moony ray Diffus'd o'er Snowden's summit mimic day; And, while the dry leaves whisper'd thro' the wood, He mark'd the casement of his hut display A long pale stream of light—and swift his blood Danc'd in his shrivell'd veins, like youth's returning flood. But suddenly a voice was heard to moan, Soft as the sighing of the southern wind; And then a milder and a milder tone:— He started, stopp'd, and trembling look'd behind. What feeble spells can hold the human mind? And now, in tears, before old Owen stood A beauteous lady! Of the loftiest kind So did she seem; but those of loftiest blood Live not in noblest deeds, as noblest natures should. The moony light fell clear upon her vest, For whiteness rivalling the stately swan; And yet less snowy than her beating breast, Whose fires the quenching tears fell fast upon; And mournful was her mien, and woe-begone: Yet her soft eyes might ruffian-rage command, Tho' her cold cheek and lip were deathly wan; For on her heart she laid her trembling hand, And, like a guilty wretch, did faint and feeble stand. And now she rush'd the woody brakes among; And now again she'd quit the dim retreat, While suddenly her nerves grew firm and strong, For in her arms she bore a baby sweet, Wrapp'd in a costly robe, with trappings meet, That glisten'd where the moon's pale lustre fell; And now she knelt forlorn at Owen's feet, While with such rending woes her heart 'gan swell As only those who feel can ever learn to tell. Slow from her breast a purse of gold she drew, (Ah, poison fatal to the soul of man!) While o'er the world a misty vapour flew; For Nature shrunk the guilty deed to scan: The fount in Owen's bosom chilly ran; The lady sigh'd—the babe his finger press'd— The lonely owl its nightly shriek began, The ring-dove murmur'd in its leafy nest, While the fell murd'rer's ghost laugh'd in his grave unblest. And now the lady spoke, with fault'ring tongue “Know'st thou the torrent by the mountain's side? There a fantastic crag with wild weeds hung Frowns o'er the thunders of the foaming tide; No mortal sounding yet the gulph has tried?” Now Owen shudder'd, for his heart grew cold; And now again the lady sternly cried,— “Down the black rock this baby must be roll'd! Nay, shrink not from the deed; be rich, as thou art bold. “Waste not in vulgar toil thy feeble age; Bid Poverty, with all its ills, retire: Ought Conscience warfare with the heart to wage, When all its passions, all its joys, expire? Who shall condemn Ambition's glorious fire? Who bid thee linger thro' thy little day The slave of gilded fools? whose ruthless ire Will bend thee to the grave, a willing prey, And bid, in envious scorn, thy very name decay. “The soldier sheds, for gold, a brother's blood; The sons of Rapine revel wild in joys; For gold the sailor ploughs the billowy flood; The statesman barters for Ambition's toys: And shall vile Misery thy peace annoy? Shall threat'ning Famine pinch thee to the heart While gold can every scorpion care destroy, Pouring its unction sweet on every smart, And blunting, ere it falls, Oppression's with'ring dart?” And now again the babe his finger press'd, Imploring silently his fost'ring care: 'Twas Nature's eloquence; it touch'd his breast, For Nature's spark was not extinguish'd there! He to his bosom snatch'd the treasure rare; It nestled fondly: while the lady base Rush'd thro' the forest; and the morning-air, Fanning with fragrant wings the baby's face, O'erspread his dimpled cheek with tints of rosy grace. Now to the margin of the rock they came: The hunter's merry horn was heard afar; The cold dew glitter'd, while the sunny flame Rush'd unimpeded o'er the morning-star, Rolling o'er clouds of gold Day's burning car: And now the lark its hymn of rapture sung, The sheep-bell tinkled, and the deaf'ning jar, Of tumbling torrents thro' the valley rung, While the young playful kid frisk'd the dank weeds among. Now Owen, pacing by the bounding flood, With arms extended held the fearless child; And soon an icy languor chill'd his blood; And now his starting eye-balls gazing wild, Fix'd on the baby, as it sweetly smil'd, While the rude crag the trembling caitiff trod; When lo! his wither'd hands, by gold defil'd, Were numb'd and palsied like a senseless clod, Smote by the chast'ning pow'r of Nature's shudd'ring God! Now up the mazes of the dark'ning dell The foster-mother, like a maniac, hied; And bursting sighs her bosom taught to swell, For at the dawn of day her son had died! Her only son—old Owen's lusty pride! But grief to horror turn'd when Owen told The story of the lady—who, to hide Her guilt and shame, had sought, by 'witching gold, To have her own dear babe down the black mountain roll'd! And ere the setting sun, with vivid ray, Gilded the casement of their hovel low, She saw the raven cross the foamy way; She heard the screech-owl o'er the mountain go; While the true sheep-dog howl'd, portending woe: Now a dim circle round the moon was roll'd, And now the church-yard elms wav'd to and fro, While the small death-watch bitter griefs foretold,— For Owen's cheek was pale, and Owen's heart was cold! CANTO II. Eight years past on, and still the stripling grew, But nothing lovely in his face was seen; His stature low, his brow of swarthy hue, And coarse and vulgar was his infant mien; A more unseemly thing scarce liv'd, I ween; Yet in his soul the pure affections shone, Meek charity, with modest pride serene; While truth and dauntless courage were his own, Tho', when he wept, his tear would melt a heart of stone. The village gossips, 'round the blazing hearth, Would talk in wonder of the foster-child; And one would say he was of lowly birth, While others thought him born of savage wild; And so they many a freezing night beguil'd: Till, falling once from an o'erhanging tree, Amidst the torrent strong, he fearless smil'd! And then the wrinkled hags with devilish glee, Swore “the undaunted boy some witch's brat must be!” And oft, upon the brow of mountain-steep, As slow the landscape faded from his view, With devious steps he wander'd far, to weep, (While all around the sultry vapours flew), Heedless of with'ring bolt, or drizzly dew: And as the giant shadows vanquish'd day, Veiling the woodland dell in dusky hue, By the small tinkling sheep-bell would he stray, And, like to elfin ghost, bemoan the hours away: And often, on the mossy bank, alone, Strange figures would he draw, and features vile; And, building a rude seat of rugged stone, Would sit whole hours, and ponder all the while; Or, talking to himself, would nod and smile; And sometimes by the starry light he'd go Where the dank yew o'erhangs the churchyard stile, And there, with hemlock, nightshade, misletoe, Weaving a poison'd wreath, would chaunt a strain of woe. No wealth had he, no garland of renown; Slow pass'd the minutes through the livelong day, Till from the upland mead, or thistled down, He watch'd the sun's last lustre fade away: And if perchance his little heart was gay, It beat to hear some merry minstrel's note, Or goat-herd caroling his roundelay On craggy cliffs, while from the linnet's throat Full many a winding trill on airy wings did float: And when the wint'ry moon, with crystal eye, Above the promontory bleak 'gan sail, Shrouding her modest brow in amber sky, While shrill the night-breeze whistled o'er the vale, Oft would he tell some melancholy tale To the deep lucid stream that wander'd slow, Listless and weary, indolent and pale, His bosom swelling high with bitter woe, Which none but luckless wight with tender heart can know. And oft to others' plaints would he give heed:— For all that griev'd, his bosom learn'd to sigh: He could not see the fleecy victim bleed, Nor snare the free-born tenant of the sky, Nor lesser wight be teazed when he stood by; For brute oppression rouz'd his little rage; In combat fierce the younker to defy He would, with breathless ire, his limbs engage, While neither threats nor pain his anger could assuage. With ebon locks unkempt, and mean attire, A mountain weather-beaten wight was he:— And passing meek; save when resentful ire Bade from his glance the living lightning flee, To think that Vice should Virtue's master be: For, tho' no classic knowledge grac'd his mind From legends old, or feats of chivalry, Still 'round his heart the wond'rous instinct twin'd Which throbb'd in every vein—the love of human kind. One night, the murky eve of Christmas-day, When mystic-fraught the wint'ry tempest blows, Dim shadows hover'd in the blunted ray, While red the moon o'er Snowden's summit rose: And soon fierce hurricanes the Heav'ns unclose; Howling, the wild blast danc'd upon the wave; And now a blazing fire the mountain shows; The troubled streams like blood their margent lave; And rays of livid light gleam o'er old Owen's grave. The foster-mother rose in dread dismay, And to the wayward stripling's chamber went; And now the paly stream of tardy day Stole down the hill, with frozen dew besprent, Silv'ring with light the little tenement: The swarthy boy upon his pallet rude Slept sweet and soundly, dreaming of content; While eager-ey'd the foster-mother stood, Like a fell bird of prey watching a victim brood: For idle tales had now been widely spread,— That potent witchcraft had possest the child; That mystic spells, from pois'nous herbage shed, The urchin's wand'ring senses had beguil'd, Filling his brain with incantations wild: And some did swear that, by a fiend possest, Like a vile killcrop, breathing airs defil'd, The corn would mildew, by his fingers prest, And new-born babes expire, meeting his glance unblest. Near where the black-thorn mark'd the barren hill, Dotting with frequent tufts its rugged side, In a clay hut, a wither'd imp of ill Her art accurst for many a year had plied: Bearded she was, and swart, and haggard-eyed; And on her back a lump deforming grew; A huge dried snake about her waist was tied, And hideous forms upon the floor she drew With hemlock's poison'd juice mingled with midnight dew: The wings of bats, the hides of toads, were seen Clothing the walls of her infernal cell; And spiders grim, hiding their webs between, Watch'd the foul Hag weaving her potent spell, Low-muttering like a sullen fiend of hell: A murderer's scull, fall'n from a gibbet high, And fill'd with water from a stagnant well, Oft to her skinny lips she would apply, With many a bitter curse and many a labour'd sigh: Close at her feet a brindled mastiff lay, Watching her busy toil with bloodshot eyes; And now he howl'd, as if with dire dismay, Shaking the hovel with his fearful cries; And now, with hide erect, he couching lies: A rav'ning kite, which on the lattice stood, With side-glance keen the wither'd sorc'ress spies, His talons streaming with the wild kid's blood, Which down the thorny steep roll'd in a crimson flood. Thither in haste the foster-mother flew, To traffic with the wicked imp of hell: For ev'ry starry path the sorc'ress knew; Could mark how high the stormy flood would swell; Of comets prattle, and eclipse foretel; Draw from their mould'ring shrouds the guilty dead; Ride on the whirlwind over hill and dell; Dance on the murderer's grave, and fearless tread O'er the wide yawning wave of Ocean's foamy bed. And now the foster-mother told her tale (The sorc'ress list'ning with malignant smile), How the lorn boy would wander, sad and pale; Or pluck the yew-tree from the church-yard stile; Or bind his brows with weeds and herbage vile: How he would sing his wild song to the blast, And so night's melancholy noon beguile; Or, when the death-knell o'er the meadow pass'd, Sigh thro' the dreary hour, and wish it were his last. And now again the witch, with ghastly grin, Turn'd to her rushy bed, and shriek'd with joy: For, there full many a wither'd branch was seen, And many a herb infectious, to destroy, Gather'd at dawn-light by the foster-boy; For, oftimes he the spiteful Hag would taunt, And, scatt'ring poisons, her lone hours annoy; Or, shrieking like a ghost, her threshold haunt, Till morn above the steep its gaudy beams would flaunt: And now across her path the straw he threw, Or scratch'd her shrivel'd arm with crooked pin; Now up the moon-light lane her feet pursue, And shout behind her with insulting din:— To mock the old and feeble were a sin: But that the subtle Hag, with menac'd rage, Would urge the daily warfare to begin; And oft with stick and stone in fight engage, Mingling with potent wrath the peevish bent of age. The tale being told, the little wretch forlorn Was sentenc'd to endure each wounding wrong; Assail'd by all the shafts of ribald scorn, And mark'd the make-game of a senseless throng;— For, Persecution is a giant strong. And now his food was frequently denied; His sport was seldom, and his labor long; His hunger, herbs medicinal supplied, With ears of mildew'd corn, steep'd in the sandy tide. One morn the foster-mother early rose; 'Twas the blythe morn of love-inspiring May: But fearful dreams had haunted her repose, Dark'ning the splendour of the rising day: She sought the boy,—but he was far away! For sharp unkindness did his peace annoy, And little could he brook the rigid sway! Which tyrant natures, tyrant souls, enjoy; Their cruel sport to wound—their triumph to destroy! Yet whither could the little wand'rer go? A stranger to the world's wide mazes he; Despair his guide, his sole companion Woe— A solitary exile doom'd to be: He gaz'd aghast; no friend his eyes could see; And yet in fancy he beheld the day When, smiling, on his foster-mother's knee, He oftentimes has heard her sighing say, How to her cot he came bedight in rich array. Perchance, he thought, some lord his sire might live; Some lady sweet his bashful mother prove, While shame might bid her to a stranger give The holy treasure of a parent's love. O barbarous Pride! which Nature cannot move; Shall her poor offspring ever plead in vain? Shall they, unown'd by guilty greatness, rove; Or, lost in ignorance, unblest remain, Like a wild with'ring tree plac'd on a desert plain? And now his fev'rish brain began to burn, While Mem'ry conjur'd up each hour to view Which, erst so tranquil, never could return— Ah, Memory! sad thy visions are, and true!— When dark Despair a gloomy picture drew; While Fancy madden'd on the varied scene: And now the clouds resum'd a cheerful hue; Yet, while he watch'd the rays of light between, On all the earth there breath'd no wretch so lorn, I ween. O'er hill and dale the friendless foster-child, With weary footsteps, bent his lonely way: And now he hasten'd o'er the thorny wild; Now by the rippling brook would musing stay; Or dream, on flow'ry banks, of visions gay: Then, starting wild, his pilgrimage pursue, Not knowing whither he was doom'd to stray, While his wan cheek was sprent with chilling dew, Or fierce the angry storm athwart his bosom flew. At length gaunt Poverty, of sallow hue, And cold Neglect, with all their rueful train, About his heart their with'ring mischiefs threw; And sorely was he pinch'd with bitter pain: Yet proud was he, and fraught with high disdain, Tho' many a day he fasted sad and lone; And all night long across the dismal plain He pour'd, amid the blast, his rending groan, While the faint glimm'ring stars in chilling lustre shone: And many a burning day, and freezing night, The little trav'ller on his journey bent; And often, by the moon-beam's quiv'ring light, He watch'd his shadow length'ning as he went, And, so companion'd, seem'd awhile content: Yet when, perchance, he met a lady gay, With sudden pangs his little heart was rent; For then remembrance shew'd the rich array Which (so the tale was told) bedeck'd his natal day. It so befel that, on a summer's eve, A stately mansion met his tearful eyes: And suddenly his soul forgot to grieve; And straight a beauteous lady he espies: With unknown hopes his heavy heart did rise, For on her cheek a gentle smile was seen; And now she mark'd his form with fond surprise! For, by his father's smile, his father's mien, Her own wrong'd baby-boy she knew full well, I ween. 'Twas Instinct rushing thro' her beating breast! Instinct, the lamp divine that lights the soul; For many a night, depriv'd of balmy rest, Her fev'rish eye-balls had been taught to roll: Oh! what can conscious agony control? And, when she ponder'd on the foaming tide, From her shrunk heart Hope's soothing visions stole; And sick'ning was the luxury of Pride, While all the mother's fears beat high against her side. Now the wide country 'round with revels rung: “The Stranger Boy” was sov'reign of the scene; And there the minstrel play'd, the peasant sung, And dancing circles dotted o'er the green; Such rural merriment had ne'er been seen: The soft harp echo'd down the woody dell; And sporting gay the sombre shades between, The wild goat wanton'd; while afar the swell On the light breeze was borne, of many a distant bell. But who can paint the mother's silent joy? Who measure the full transport of her soul? While on the smiling cheek of her lost boy Her tears repentant swiftly now 'gan roll: And woe to him who would their course control! For 'twas the extract of the wounded heart, Wafted to Heaven by sighs that Nature stole— Sighs which more sacred rapture can impart Than all the pomp of wealth, and all the smiles of art! THE LADY OF THE BLACK TOWER. [PART FIRST] “Watch no more the twinkling stars; Watch no more the chalky bourne; Lady! from the Holy wars Never will thy Love return! Cease to watch, and cease to mourn, Thy Lover never will return! “Watch no more the yellow moon, Peering o'er the mountain's head; Rosy day, returning soon, Will see thy Lover, pale and dead! Cease to weep, and cease to mourn, Thy Lover will no more return! “Lady, in the Holy wars, Fighting for the Cross, he died; Low he lies, and many scars Mark his cold and mangled side; In his winding-sheet he lies, Lady! check those rending sighs. “Hark! the hollow sounding gale Seems to sweep in murmurs by, Sinking slowly down the vale; Wherefore, gentle Lady, sigh? Wherefore moan, and wherefore sigh? Lady! all that live must die. “Now the stars are fading fast: Swift their brilliant course are run; Soon shall dreary night be past: Soon shall rise the cheering sun! The sun will rise to gladden thee: Lady, Lady, cheerful be.” So spake a voice! While sad and lone, Upon a lofty tower, reclin'd, A Lady sat: the pale moon shone, And sweetly blew the summer wind; Yet still, disconsolate in mind, The lovely Lady sat reclin'd. The lofty tow'r was ivy clad; And round a dreary forest rose; The midnight bell was tolling sad— 'Twas tolling for a soul's repose! The Lady heard the gates unclose, And from her seat in terror rose. The summer moon shone bright and clear; She saw the castle gates unclose; And now she saw four monks appear, Loud chanting for a soul's repose. Forbear, oh, Lady! look no more— They pass'd—a livid corpse they bore. They pass'd, and all was silent now; The breeze upon the forest slept; The moon stole o'er the mountain's brow; Again the Lady sigh'd, and wept: She watch'd the holy fathers go Along the forest path below. And now the dawn was bright, the dew Upon the yellow heath was seen; The clouds were of a rosy hue, The sunny lustre shone between: The Lady to the chapel ran, While the slow matin prayer began. And then, once more, the fathers grey She mark'd, employ'd in holy prayer: Her heart was full, she cou'd not pray, For love and fear were masters there. Ah, Lady! thou wilt pray ere long To sleep those lonely aisles among! And now the matin prayers were o'er; The barefoot monks, of order grey, Where thronging to the chapel door, When there the Lady stopp'd the way: “Tell me,” she cried, “whose corpse so pale, Last night ye bore along the vale?” “Oh, Lady! question us no more: No corpse did we bear down the dale!” The Lady sunk upon the floor, Her quivering lip was deathly pale. The barefoot monks now whisper'd, sad, “God grant our Lady be not mad.” The monks departing, one by one, The chapel gates in silence close; When from the altar steps, of stone, The trembling Lady feebly goes: While the morning sheds a ruby light, The painted windows glowing bright. And now she heard a hollow sound; It seem'd to come from graves below; And now again she look'd around, A voice came murm'ring sad and slow; And now she heard it feebly cry, “Lady! all that live must die!” “Watch no more from yonder tow'r, Watch no more the star of day! Watch no more the dawning hour, That chases sullen night away! Cease to watch, and cease to mourn, Thy Lover will no more return!” She look'd around, and now she view'd, Clad in a doublet gold and green, A youthful knight: he frowning stood And noble was his mournful mien; And now he said, with heaving sigh, “Lady, all that live must die!” She rose to quit the altar's stone, She cast a look to heaven and sigh'd, When lo! the youthful knight was gone; And, scowling by the Lady's side, With sightless skull and bony hand, She saw a giant spectre stand! His flowing robe was long and clear, His ribs were white as drifted snow: The Lady's heart was chill'd with fear; She rose, but scarce had power to go: The spectre grinn'd a dreadful smile, And walk'd beside her down the aisle. And now he wav'd his rattling hand; And now they reach'd the chapel door, And there the spectre took his stand; While, rising from the marble floor, A hollow voice was heard to cry, “Lady, all that live must die! “Watch no more the evening star! Watch no more the glimpse of morn! Never from the Holy War, Lady, will thy Love return! See this bloody cross; and see His bloody scarf he sends to thee!” And now again the youthful knight Stood smiling by the Lady's side; His helmet shone with crimson light, His sword with drops of blood was dy'd: And now a soft and mournful song Stole the chapel aisles among. Now from the spectre's paley cheek The flesh began to waste away; The vaulted doors were heard to creek, And dark became the Summer day! The spectre's eyes were sunk, but he Seem'd with their sockets still to see! The second bell is heard to ring: Four barefoot monks, of orders grey, Again their holy service sing; And round the chapel altar pray: The Lady counted o'er and o'er, And shudder'd while she counted—four! “Oh! Fathers, who was he, so gay, That stood beside the chapel door? Oh! tell me fathers, tell me pray.” The monks replied, “We fathers four, Lady no other have we seen, Since in this holy place we've been!” PART SECOND. Now the merry bugle horn Thro' the forest sounded far; When on the lofty tow'r, forlorn, The Lady watch'd the evening star; The evening star that seem'd to be Rising from the dark'ned sea! The Summer sea was dark and still, The sky was streak'd with lines of gold, The mist rose grey above the hill, And low the clouds of amber roll'd: The Lady on the lofty tow'r Watch'd the calm and silent hour. And, while she watch'd, she saw advance A ship, with painted streamers gay: She saw it on the green wave dance, And plunge amid the silver spray; While from the forest's haunts, forlorn, Again she heard the bugle horn. The sails were full; the breezes rose; The billows curl'd along the shore; And now the day began to close;— The bugle horn was heard no more, But, rising from the wat'ry way, An airy voice was heard to say: “Watch no more the evening star; Watch no more the billowy sea; Lady, from the Holy War Thy lover hastes to comfort thee: Lady, Lady, cease to mourn; Soon thy lover will return.” Now she hastens to the bay; Now the rising storm she hears; Now the sailors smiling say, “Lady, Lady, check your fears: Trust us, Lady; we will be Your pilots o'er the stormy sea.” Now the little bark she view'd, Moor'd beside the flinty steep; And now, upon the foamy flood, The tranquil breezes seem'd to sleep. The moon arose; her silver ray Seem'd on the silent deep to play. Now music stole across the main: It was a sweet but mournful tone; It came a slow and dulcet strain; It came from where the pale moon shone: And, while it pass'd across the sea, More soft, and soft, it seem'd to be. Now on the deck the Lady stands; The vessel steers across the main; It steers towards the Holy Land, Never to return again: Still the sailors cry, “We'll be Your pilots o'er the stormy sea.” Now she hears a low voice say, “Deeper, deeper, deeper still; Hark! the black'ning billows play; Hark! the waves the vessel fill: Lower, lower, down we go; All is dark and still below. Now a flash of vivid light On the rolling deep was seen! And now the Lady saw the Knight, With doublet rich of gold and green: From the sockets of his eyes, A pale and streaming light she spies! And now his form transparent stood, Smiling with a ghastly mien;— And now the calm and boundless flood Was, like the emerald, bright and green; And now 'twas of a troubled hue, While, “Deeper, deeper,” sang the crew. Slow advanced the morning-light, Slow they plough'd the wavy tide; When, on a cliff of dreadful height, A castle's lofty tow'rs they spied: The Lady heard the sailor-band Cry, “Lady, this is Holy Land. “Watch no more the glitt'ring spray; Watch no more the weedy sand; Watch no more the star of day; Lady, this is Holy Land: This castle's lord shall welcome thee; Then Lady, Lady, cheerful be!” Now the castle-gates they pass; Now across the spacious square, Cover'd high with dewy grass, Trembling steals the Lady fair: And now the castle's lord was seen, Clad in a doublet gold and green. He led her thro' the gothic hall, With bones and skulls encircled round; “Oh, let not this thy soul appal!” He cried, “for this is Holy Ground” He led her thro' the chambers lone, 'Mid many a shriek and many a groan. Now to the banquet-room they came: Around a table of black stone She mark'd a faint and vapoury flame; Upon the horrid feast it shone— And there, to close the madd'ning sight, Unnumber'd spectres met the light. Their teeth were like the brilliant, bright; Their eyes were blue as sapphire clear; Their bones were of a polish'd white; Gigantic did their ribs appear!— And now the Knight the Lady led, And plac'd her at the table's head!— Just now the Lady woke:—for she Had slept upon the lofty tow'r, And dreams of dreadful phantasie Had fill'd the lonely moon-light hour: Her pillow was the turret-stone, And on her breast the pale moon shone. But now a real voice she hears: It was her lover's voice;—for he, To calm her bosom's rending fears, That night had cross'd the stormy sea: “I come,” said he, “from Palestine, To prove myself, sweet Lady, thine.” ALL ALONE. Ah! wherefore by the Church-yard side, Poor little lorn one, dost thou stray? Thy wavy locks but thinly hide The tears that dim thy blue-eye's ray; And wherefore dost thou sigh, and moan, And weep, that thou art left alone? Thou art not left alone, poor boy, The Trav'ller stops to hear thy tale; No heart, so hard, would thee annoy! For tho' thy mother's cheek is pale, And withers under yon grave stone, Thou art not, Urchin, left alone. I know thee well! thy yellow hair In silky waves I oft have seen; Thy dimpled face, so fresh and fair, Thy roguish smile, thy playful mien, Were all to me, poor Orphan, known, Ere Fate had left thee—all alone! Thy russet coat is scant, and torn, Thy cheek is now grown deathly pale! Thy eyes are dim, thy looks forlorn, And bare thy bosom meets the gale; And oft I hear thee deeply groan, That thou, poor boy, art left alone. Thy naked feet are wounded sore With thorns, that cross thy daily road; The winter winds around thee roar, The church-yard is thy bleak abode; Thy pillow now a cold grave stone— And there thou lov'st to grieve—alone! The rain has drench'd thee, all night long; The nipping frost thy bosom froze; And still, the yew-tree shades among, I heard thee sigh thy artless woes; I heard thee, till the day-star shone In darkness weep—and weep alone! Oft have I seen thee, little boy, Upon thy lovely mother's knee; For when she-liv'd, thou wert her joy, Though now a mourner thou must be! For she lies low, where yon grave-stone Proclaims that thou art left alone. Weep, weep no more; on yonder hill The village bells are ringing, gay; The merry reed, and brawling rill Call thee to rustic sports away. Then wherefore weep, and sigh, and moan, A truant from the throng—alone? “I cannot the green hill ascend, I cannot pace the upland mead; I cannot in the vale attend To hear the merry-sounding reed: For all is still beneath yon stone, Where my poor mother's left alone! “I cannot gather gaudy flowers To dress the scene of revels loud— I cannot pass the ev'ning hours Among the noisy village croud; For all in darkness, and alone My mother sleeps, beneath yon stone. “See how the stars begin to gleam, The sheep-dog barks—'tis time to go; The night-fly hums, the moonlight beam Peeps through the yew-trees' shadowy row: It falls upon the white grave-stone, Where my dear mother sleeps alone. “O stay me not, for I must go, The upland path in haste to tread; For there the pale primroses grow, They grow to dress my mother's bed. They must, ere peep of day, be strown, Where she lies mould'ring all alone. “My father o'er the stormy sea To distant lands was borne away, And still my mother stay'd with me, And wept by night and toil'd by day. And shall I ever quit the stone Where she is left to sleep alone. “My father, died and still I found My mother fond and kind to me; I felt her breast with rapture bound When first I prattled on her knee— And then she blest my infant tone, And little thought of yon grave-stone. “No more her gentle voice I hear, No more her smile of fondness see; Then wonder not I shed the tear, She would have died to follow me! And yet she sleeps beneath yon stone, And I still live—to weep alone. “The playful kid, she lov'd so well, From yon high clift was seen to fall; I heard afar his tink'ling bell, Which seem'd in vain for aid to call— I heard the harmless suff'rer moan, And griev'd that he was left alone. “Our faithful dog grew mad, and died, The lightning smote our cottage low— We had no resting-place beside, And knew not whither we should go: For we were poor—and hearts of stone Will never throb at mis'ry's groan. “My mother still surviv'd for me, She led me to the mountain's brow, She watch'd me, while at yonder tree I sat, and wove the ozier bough; And oft she cried, “fear not, mine own! Thou shalt not, boy, be left alone.” “The blast blew strong, the torrent rose And bore our shatter'd cot away; And where the clear brook swiftly flows, Upon the turf, at dawn of day, When bright the sun's full lustre shone, I wander'd, friendless—and alone!” Thou art not, boy, for I have seen Thy tiny footsteps print the dew, And while the morning sky serene Spread o'er the hill a yellow hue, I heard thy sad and plaintive moan, Beside the cold sepulchral stone. And when the summer noontide hours With scorching rays the landscape spread, I mark'd thee, weaving fragrant flow'rs To deck thy mother's silent bed! Nor at the church-yard's simple stone Wert thou, poor Urchin, left alone. I follow'd thee along the dale, And up the woodland's shad'wy way: I heard thee tell thy mournful tale As slowly sunk the star of day: Nor when its twinkling light had flown Wert thou a wand'rer all alone. “O! yes, I was! and still shall be A wand'rer, mourning and forlorn; For what is all the world to me— What are the dews and buds of morn? Since she who left me sad, alone In darkness sleeps, beneath yon stone! “No brother's tear shall fall for me, For I no brother ever knew; No friend shall weep my destiny, For friends are scarce, and tears are few; None do I see, save on this stone, Where I will stay and weep alone. “My Father never will return, He rests beneath the sea-green wave; I have no kindred left to mourn When I am hid in yonder grave: Not one to dress with flow'rs the stone! Then—surely, I am left alone!” OLD BARNARD. A MONKISH TALE. Old Barnard was still a lusty hind, Though his age was full fourscore; And he us'd to go Thro' hail and snow, To a neighb'ring town, With his old coat brown, To beg at his Grandson's door! Old Barnard briskly jogg'd along, When the hail and the snow did fall; And whatever the day, He was always gay, Did the broad Sun glow, Or the keen wind blow, While he begg'd in his Grandson's Hall. His Grandson was a Squire, and he Had houses, and lands, and gold; And a coach beside, And horses to ride, And a downy bed To repose his head, And he felt not the winter's cold. Old Barnard had neither house nor lands, Nor gold to buy warm array; Nor a coach to carry His old bones weary, Nor beds of feather, In freezing weather To sleep the long nights away. But Barnard a quiet conscience had, No guile did his bosom know; And when Ev'ning clos'd His old bones repos'd, Tho' the wint'ry blast O'er his hovel past, And he slept while the winds did blow. But his Grandson he could never sleep 'Till the Sun began to rise; For a fev'rish pain Oppress'd his brain, And he fear'd some evil, And dream'd of the Devil Whenever he clos'd his eyes! And whenever he feasted the rich and gay, The Devil still had his joke; For however rare The sumptuous fare, When the sparkling glass Was seen to pass— He was fearful the draught would choke! And whenever, in fine and costly geer, The Squire went forth to ride The owl would cry, And the raven fly Across his road, While the sluggish toad Would crawl by his Palfry's side And he could not command the sunny day, For the rain would wet him through; And the wind would blow Where his nag did go, And the thunder roar, And the torrents pour, And he felt the chill Evening dew. And the cramp would ring his youthful bones, And would make him groan aloud; And the doctor's art Could not cure the heart, While the conscience still Was o'ercharg'd with ill; And he dream'd of the pick-axe and shroud. And why could Old Barnard sweetly sleep, Since so poor, and so old was he? Because he could say At the close of day, “I have done no wrong To the weak or strong, And so Heaven look kind on me!” One night the Grandson hied him forth To a Monk that liv'd hard by; “O! Father!” said he, “I am come to thee, For I'm sick of sin, And would fain begin To repent me before I die!” “I must pray for your Soul;” the Monk replied, “But will see you to-morrow, ere noon: Then the Monk flew straight To Old Barnard's gate, And he bade him haste O'er the dewy waste, By the light of the waning Moon. In the Monkish cell did old Barnard wait, And his Grandson went thither soon; In a habit of grey, Ere the dawn of day, With a cowl and cross, On the sill of moss, He knelt by the light of the Moon. “O! shrive me, Father!” the Grandson cried, “For the Devil is waiting for me! I have robb'd the poor, I have shut my door, And kept out the good When they wanted food, And I come for my pardon to thee.” “Get home, young Sinner,” Old Barnard said, “And your Grandsire quickly see; Give him half your store, For he's old and poor, And avert each evil, And cheat the Devil, By making him rich as thee.” The Squire obey'd; and Old Barnard now Is rescued from every evil: For he fears no wrong From the weak or strong, And the Squire can snore When the loud winds roar, For he dreams no more of the devil. THE HAUNTED BEACH. Upon a lonely desart Beach, Where the white foam was scatter'd, A little shed uprear'd its head, Though lofty barks were shatter'd. The sea-weeds gath'ring near the door. A sombre path display'd; And, all around, the deaf'ning roar Re-echo'd on the chalky shore, By the green billows made. Above a jutting cliff was seen Where Sea Birds hover'd, craving; And all around the craggs were bound With weeds—for ever waving. And here and there, a cavern wide Its shad'wy jaws display'd; And near the sands, at ebb of tide, A shiver'd mast was seen to ride Where the green billows stray'd. And often, while the moaning wind Stole o'er the Summer Ocean, The moonlight scene was all serene, The waters scarce in motion; Then, while the smoothly slanting sand The tall cliff wrapp'd in shade, The Fisherman beheld a band Of Spectres gliding hand in hand— Where the green billows play'd. And pale their faces were as snow, And sullenly they wander'd; And to the skies with hollow eyes They look'd as though they ponder'd. And sometimes, from their hammock shroud, They dismal howlings made, And while the blast blew strong and loud The clear moon mark'd the ghastly croud, Where the green billows play'd! And then above the haunted hut The Curlews screaming hover'd; And the low door, with furious roar, The frothy breakers cover'd. For in the Fisherman's lone shed A murder'd man was laid, With ten wide gashes in his head, And deep was made his sandy bed Where the green billows play'd. A shipwreck'd Mariner was he, Doom'd from his home to sever Who swore to be thro' wind and sea Firm and undaunted ever! And when the wave resistless roll'd, About his arm he made A packet rich of Spanish gold, And, like a British sailor bold, Plung'd where the billows play'd! The Spectre band, his messmates brave, Sunk in the yawning ocean, While to the mast he lash'd him fast, And brav'd the storm's commotion. The winter moon upon the sand A silv'ry carpet made, And mark'd the Sailor reach the land, And mark'd his murd'rer wash his hand Where the green billows play'd. And since that hour the Fisherman Has toil'd and toil'd in vain; For all the night the moony light Gleams on the specter'd main! And when the skies are veil'd in gloom, The Murd'rer's liquid way Bounds o'er the deeply yawning tomb, And flashing fires the sands illume, Where the green billows play! Full thirty years his task has been, Day after day more weary; For Heav'n design'd his guilty mind Should dwell on prospects dreary. Bound by a strong and mystic chain, He has not pow'r to stray; But destin'd mis'ry to sustain, He wastes, in Solitude and Pain, A loathsome life away. THE TRUMPETER. AN OLD ENGLISH TALE. It was in the days of a gay British King (In the old fashion'd custom of merry-making) The Palace of Woodstock with revels did ring, While they sang and carous'd—one and all: For the monarch a plentiful treasury had, And his courtiers were pleas'd, and no visage was sad, And the knavish and foolish with drinking were mad, While they sat in the banquetting hall. Some talk'd of their valour, and some of their race, And vaunted, till vaunting was black in the face; Some bragg'd for a title, and some for a place, And, like braggarts, they bragg'd one and all! Some spoke of their scars in the holy crusade, Some boasted the banner of fame they display'd, And some sang their loves in the soft serenade As they sat in the banquetting hall. And here sat a baron, and there sat a knight, And here stood a page in his habit all bright, And here a young soldier in armour bedight With a friar carous'd, one and all. Some play'd on the dulcimer, some on the lute, And some, who had nothing to talk of, were mute, Till the morning, awakened, put on her grey suit— And the lark hover'd over the hall. It was in a vast gothic hall that they sate, And the tables were cover'd with rich gilded plate, And the King and his minions were toping in state, Till their noddles turn'd round, one and all— And the sun through the tall painted windows 'gan peep, And the vassals were sleeping, or longing to sleep, Though the courtiers, still waking, their revels did keep, While the minstrels play'd sweet, in the hall. And, now in their cups, the bold topers began To call for more wine, from the cellar yeoman, And, while each one replenish'd his goblet or can, The monarch thus spake to them all: “It is fit that the nobles do just what they please, That the great live in idleness, riot, and ease, And that those should be favor'd, who mark my decrees, And should feast in the banquetting hall. “It is fit,” said the monarch, “that riches should claim A passport to freedom, to honor, and fame,— That the poor should be humble, obedient, and tame, And, in silence, submit—one and all. That the wise and the holy should toil for the great, That the vassals should tend at the tables of state, That the pilgrim should—pray for our souls at the gate While we feast in our banquetting hall. “That the low-lineag'd Carles should be scantily fed— That their drink should be small, and still smaller their bread; That their wives and their daughters to ruin be led, And submit to our will, one and all! It is fit, that whoever I choose to defend— Shall be courted, and feasted, and lov'd as a friend, While before them the good and enlighten'd shall bend While they sit in the banquetting hall.” Now the topers grew bold, and each talk'd of his right, One would fain be a baron, another a knight; And another (because at the tournament fight He had vanquished his foes, one and all) Demanded a track of rich lands, and rich fare, And of stout serving vassals a plentiful share; With a lasting exemption from penance and pray'r, And a throne in the banquetting hall. But one, who had neither been valiant nor wise, With a tone of importance, thus vauntingly cries, “My leige he knows how a good subject to prize— And I therefore demand—before all— I this castle possess: and the right to maintain Five hundred stout bowmen to follow my train, And as many strong vassals to guard my domain As the lord of the banquetting hall! “I have fought with all nations, and bled in the field, See my lance is unshiver'd, though batter'd my shield, I have combatted legions, yet never would yield, And the enemy fled—one and all! I have rescued a thousand fair donnas, in Spain, I have left in gay France every bosom in pain, I have conquer'd the Russian, the Prussian, the Dane, And will reign in the banquetting hall!” The monarch now rose, with majestical look, And his sword from the scabbard of jewels he took, And the castle with laughter and ribaldry shook, While the braggart accosted thus he: “I will give thee a place that will suit thy demand, What to thee is more fitting than vassals or land— I will give thee,—what justice and valour command, For a Trumpeter bold—thou shalt be!” Now the revellers rose, and began to complain— While they menac'd with gestures, and frown'd with disdain, And declar'd, that the nobles were fitter to reign Than a prince so unruly as he. But the monarch cried, sternly, they taunted him so, “From this moment the counsel of fools I forego— And on wisdom and virtue will honors bestow For such, only, are welcome to me!” So saying, he quitted the banquetting hall, And leaving his courtiers and flatterers all— Straightway for his confessor loudly 'gan call “O! Father! now listen!” said he: “I have feasted the fool, I have pamper'd the knave, I have scoff'd at the wise, and neglected the brave— And here, holy man, absolution I crave— For a penitent now I will be.” From that moment the monarch grew sober and good, (And nestled with birds of a different brood,) For he found that the pathway which wisdom pursu'd Was pleasant, safe, quiet, and even! That by temperance, virtue, and liberal deeds, By nursing the flowrets, and crushing the weeds, The loftiest traveller always succeeds— For his journey will lead him to Heav'n. THE POOR SINGING DAME. Beneath an old wall, that went round an old castle, For many a year, with brown ivy o'erspread; A neat little hovel, its lowly roof raising, Defied the wild winds that howl'd over its shed: The turrets, that frown'd on the poor simple dwelling, Were rock'd to and fro, when the tempest would roar, And the river, that down the rich valley was swelling, Flow'd swiftly beside the green step of its door. The summer sun gilded the rushy roof slanting, The bright dews bespangled its ivy-bound hedge, And above, on the ramparts, the sweet birds were chanting, And wild buds thick dappled the clear river's edge. When the castle's rich chambers were haunted and dreary, The poor little hovel was still and secure; And no robber e'er enter'd, nor goblin nor fairy, For the splendors of pride had no charms to allure. The Lord of the castle, a proud surly ruler, Oft heard the low dwelling with sweet music ring, For the old Dame that liv'd in the little hut chearly, Would sit at her wheel, and would merrily sing: When with revels the castle's great hall was resounding, The old Dame was sleeping, not dreaming of fear; And when over the mountains the huntsmen were bounding She would open her lattice, their clamours to hear. To the merry-ton'd horn she would dance on the threshold, And louder, and louder, repeat her old song: And when winter its mantle of frost was displaying, She caroll'd, undaunted, the bare woods among: She would gather dry fern, ever happy and singing, With her cake of brown bread, and her jug of brown beer, And would smile when she heard the great castle-bell ringing, Inviting the proud—to their prodigal cheer. Thus she liv'd, ever patient and ever contented, Till Envy the Lord of the castle possess'd, For he hated that poverty should be so chearful, While care could the fav'rites of fortune molest; He sent his bold yeomen with threats to prevent her, And still would she carol her sweet roundelay; At last, an old steward relentless he sent her— Who bore her, all trembling, to prison away! Three weeks did she languish, then died broken-hearted, Poor Dame! how the death-bell did mournfully sound! And along the green path six young bachelors bore her, And laid her for ever beneath the cold ground! And the primroses pale 'mid the long grass were growing, The bright dews of twilight bespangled her grave, And morn heard the breezes of summer soft blowing To bid the fresh flow'rets in sympathy wave. The Lord of the castle, from that fatal moment When poor singing Mary was laid in her grave, Each night was surrounded by screech-owls appalling, Which o'er the black turrets their pinions would wave! On the ramparts that frown'd on the river, swift flowing, They hover'd, still hooting a terrible song, When his windows would rattle, the winter blast blowing, They would shriek like a ghost, the dark alleys among! Wherever he wander'd they follow'd him crying, At dawnlight, at eve, still they haunted his way! When the moon shone across the wide common they hooted, Nor quitted his path till the blazing of day. His bones began wasting, his flesh was decaying, And he hung his proud head, and he perish'd with shame; And the tomb of rich marble, no soft tear displaying, O'ershadows the grave of the poor singing dame! THE WIDOW'S HOME. Close on the margin of a brawling brook That bathes the low dell's bosom, stands a cot, O'ershadow'd by broad Alders. At its door A rude seat, with an ozier canopy, Invites the weary traveller to rest. 'Tis a poor humble dwelling; yet within The sweets of joy domestic oft have made The long hour not unchearly, while the moor Was covered with deep snow, and the bleak blast Swept with impetuous wing the mountain's brow! On ev'ry tree of the near shelt'ring wood The minstrelsy of Nature, shrill and wild, Welcomes the stranger guest, and carolling Love-songs spontaneous, greets him merrily. The distant hills, empurpled by the dawn And thinly scatter'd with blue mists that float On their bleak summits dimly visible, Skirt the domain luxuriant, while the air Breathes healthful fragrance. On the cottage roof The gadding ivy, and the tawny vine Bind the brown thatch, the shelter'd winter-hut Of the tame Sparrow, and the Red-breast bold. There dwells the soldier's widow! young and fair, Yet not more fair than virtuous. Every day She wastes the hour-glass, waiting his return,— And every hour anticipates the day (Deceiv'd, yet cherish'd, by the flatt'rer Hope) When she shall meet her hero. On the eve Of Sabbath rest, she trims her little hut With blossoms fresh and gaudy, still herself The queen-flow'r of the garland! The sweet rose Of wood-wild beauty, blushing thro' her tears. One little son she has, a lusty boy, The darling of her guiltless mourning heart, The only dear and gay associate Of her lone widowhood. His sun-burnt cheek Is never blanch'd with fear, though he will climb The broad oak's branches, and with brawny arm Sever the limpid wave. In his blue eye Beams all his mother's gentleness of soul; While his brave father's warm intrepid heart Throbs in his infant bosom. 'Tis a wight Most valorous, yet pliant as the stem Of the low vale-born lily, when the dew Presses its perfum'd head. Eight years his voice Has chear'd the homely hut, for he could lisp Soft words of filial fondness, ere his feet Could measure the smooth path-way. On the hills He watches the wide waste of wavy green Tissu'd with orient lustre, till his eyes Ache with the dazzling splendour, and the main, Rolling and blazing, seems a second sun! And, if a distant whitening sail appears, Skimming the bright horizon, while the mast Is canopied with clouds of dappled gold, He homeward hastes rejoicing. An old tree Is his lone watch-tow'r; 'tis a blasted oak Which from a vagrant acorn, ages past, Sprang up, to triumph like a savage bold, Braving the season's warfare. There he sits Silent and musing the long evening hour, 'Till the short reign of sunny splendour fades At the cold touch of twilight. Oft he sings; Or from his oaten pipe, untiring pours The tune mellifluous which his father sung, When he could only listen. On the sands That bind the level sea-shore, will he stray, When morn unlocks the East, and flings afar The rosy day-beam! There the boy will stop To gather the dank weeds which ocean leaves On the bleak strand, while winter o'er the main Howls its nocturnal clamour. There again He chaunts his father's ditty. Never more, Poor mountain minstrel, shall thy bosom throb To the sweet cadence! never more thy tear Fall as the dulcet breathings give each word Expression magical! Thy father, boy, Sleeps on the bed of death! His tongue is mute, His fingers have forgot their pliant art, His oaten pipe will ne'er again be heard Echoing along the valley! Never more Will thy fond mother meet the balmy smile Of peace domestic, or the circling arm Of valour, temper'd by the milder joys Of rural merriment. His very name Is now forgotten! for no trophied tomb Tells of his bold exploits; such heraldry Befits not humble worth: For pomp and praise Wait in the gilded palaces of pride To dress ambition's slaves. Yet, on his grave, The unmark'd resting place of valour's sons, The morning beam shines lust'rous; the meek flow'r Still drops the twilight tear, and the night breeze Moans melancholy music! Then, to Me, O! dearer far is the poor Soldier's grave, The Widow's lone and unregarded cot, The brawling brook, and the wide alder-bough, The ozier canopy, and plumy choir, Hymning the morn's return, than the rich dome Of gilded palaces! and sweeter far— O! far more graceful! far more exquisite, The Widow's tear bathing the living rose, Than the rich ruby, blushing on the breast Of guilty greatness. Welcome then to me— The Widow's lowly home: The Soldier's heir; The proud inheritor of Heav'n's best gifts— The mind unshackled, and the guiltless soul! MISTRESS GURTON'S CAT. A DOMESTIC TALE. Old Mistress Gurton had a cat, A tabby, loveliest of the race, Sleek as a doe, and tame and fat, With velvet paws and whisker'd face; The doves of Venus not so fair, Nor Juno's peacock half so grand As Mistress Gurton's Tabby Rose, The proudest of the purring band:— So dignified in all her paces, She seem'd a pupil of the Graces! There never was a finer creature In all the varying whims of Nature! All liked Grimalkin, passing well! Save Mistress Gurton, and, 'tis said, She oft with furious ire would swell, When, through neglect or hunger keen, Puss, with a pilfer'd scrap, was seen Swearing beneath the pent-house shed: For, like some fav'rites, she was bent On all things, yet with none content; And still, whate'er her place or diet, She could not pick her bone in quiet. Sometimes, new milk Grimalkin stole, And sometimes—over-set the bowl! For over eagerness will prove Oft times the bane of what we love; And sometimes, to her neighbour's home Grimalkin like a thief would roam, Teaching poor cats of humbler kind, For high example sways the mind! Sometimes she paced the garden wall, Thick guarded by the shatter'd pane, And lightly treading with disdain, Fear'd not ambition's certain fall! Old china broke, or scratch'd her Dame, And brought domestic friends to shame! And many a time this cat was curst, Of squalling thieving things the worst! Wish'd dead, and menac'd with a string, For cats of such scant fame deserv'd to swing! One day Report, for ever busy, Resolv'd to make Dame Gurton easy; A neighbour came, with solemn look, And thus the dismal tidings broke. “Know you that poor Grimalkin died Last night, upon the pent-house side? I heard her for assistance call; I heard her shrill and dying squall! I heard her, in reproachful tone, Pour to the stars her feeble groan! Alone I heard her piercing cries— “With not a friend to close her eyes!” “Poor Puss! I vow it grieves me sore Never to see thy beauties more! Never again to hear thee purr, To stroke thy back of zebra fur; To see thy emral'd eyes, so bright, Flashing around their lust'rous light Amid the solemn shades of night! “Methinks I see her pretty paws— As gracefully she paced along; I hear her voice, so shrill, among The chimney rows! I see her claws, While like a tyger she pursued Undauntedly the pilf'ring race; I see her lovely whisker'd face When she her nimble prey subdued! And then how she would frisk and play, And purr the evening hours away: Now stretch'd beside the social fire; Now on the sunny lawn at noon, Watching the vagrant birds that flew Across the scene of varied hue, To peck the fruit. Or when the moon Stole o'er the hills, in silv'ry suit, How would she chaunt her lovelorn tale, Soft as the wild Eolian lyre! 'Till ev'ry brute, on hill, in dale, Listen'd with wonder mute!” “O cease!” exclaim'd Dame Gurton straight, “Has my poor Puss been torn away? Alas! how cruel is my fate, How shall I pass the tedious day? Where can her mourning mistress find So sweet a cat? so meek, so kind! So keen a mouser, such a beauty, So orderly, so fond, so true, That every gentle task of duty The dear domestic creature knew! Hers was the mildest tend'rest heart! She knew no little cattish art; Not cross, like fav'rite cats, was she, But seem'd the queen of cats to be! I cannot live—since doom'd, alas! to part From poor Grimalkin kind, the darling of my heart!” And now Dame Gurton, bath'd in tears, With a black top-knot vast appears: Some say that a black gown she wore, As many oft have done before, For beings valued less, I ween, Than this, of tabby cats the fav'rite queen!— But, lo! soon after, one fair day, Puss, who had only been a roving, Across the pent-house took her way To see her dame, so sad, and loving; Eager to greet the mourning fair, She enter'd by a window, where A china bowl of luscious cream Was quiv'ring in the sunny beam. Puss, who was somewhat tired and dry, And somewhat fond of bev'rage sweet, Beholding such a tempting treat, Resolved its depth to try. She saw the warm and dazzling ray Upon the spotless surface play; She purr'd around its circle wide, And gaz'd, and long'd, and mew'd, and sigh'd! But Fate, unfriendly, did that hour controul, She overset the cream, and smash'd the gilded bowl! As Mistress Gurton heard the thief, She started from her easy chair, And, quite unmindful of her grief, Began aloud to swear! “Curse that voracious beast!” she cried, “Here, Susan, bring a cord— I'll hang the vicious, ugly creature— The veriest plague e'er form'd by nature!” And Mistress Gurton kept her word— And poor Grimalkin—died! Thus often we with anguish sore The dead in clam'rous grief deplore; Who, were they once alive again, Would meet the sting of cold disdain! For Friends, whom trifling faults can sever, Are valued most—when lost for ever! THE LASCAR. IN TWO PARTS. [PART FIRST] “Another day, Ah! me, a day Of dreary Sorrow is begun! And still I loath the temper'd ray, And still I hate the sickly Sun! Far from my native Indian shore, I hear our wretched race deplore; I mark the smile of taunting Scorn, And curse the hour when I was born! I weep, but no one gently tries To stop my tear, or check my sighs; For while my heart beats mournfully, Dear Indian home, I sigh for Thee! “Since, gaudy Sun! I see no more Thy hottest glory gild the day; Since, sever'd from my burning shore, I waste the vapid hours away; O! darkness come! come deepest gloom; Shroud the young Summer's op'ning bloom! Burn, temper'd Orb, with fiercer beams This northern world! and drink the streams That thro' the fertile vallies glide To bathe the feasted Fiends of Pride! Or hence, broad Sun! extinguish'd be! For endless night encircles Me! What is to me the City gay? And what the board profusely spread? I have no home, no rich array, No spicy feast, no downy bed! I with the dogs am doom'd to eat, To perish in the peopl'd street, To drink the tear of deep despair, The scoff and scorn of fools to bear! I sleep upon the pavement stone, Or pace the meadows, wild—alone! And if I curse my fate severe Some Christian Savage mocks my tear! “Shut out the Sun, O! pitying Night! Make the wide world my silent tomb! O'ershade this northern, sickly light, And shroud me in eternal gloom! My Indian plains now smiling glow, There stands my Parent's hovel low, And there the tow'ring aloes rise, And fling their perfumes to the skies! There the broad palm trees covert lend, There Sun and Shade delicious blend; But here, amid the blunted ray, Cold shadows hourly cross my way. “Was it for this, that on the main I met the tempest fierce and strong, And steering o'er the liquid plain, Still onward, press'd the waves among? Was it for this the Lascar brave Toil'd like a wretched Indian Slave; Preserv'd your treasures by his toil, And sigh'd to greet this fertile soil? Was it for this, to beg, to die! Where plenty smiles, and where the sky Sheds cooling airs; while fev'rish pain Maddens the famish'd Lascar's brain? “Oft I the stately Camel led, And sung the short-hour'd night away; And oft, upon the top-mast's head, Hail'd the red Eye of coming day. The Tanyan's back my mother bore; And oft the wavy Ganges roar Lull'd her to rest, as on she past, 'Mid the hot sands and burning blast! And oft beneath the Banyan tree She sate and fondly nourish'd me; And while the noontide hour past slow I felt her breast with kindness glow. “Where'er I turn my sleepless eyes No cheek so dark as mine I see; For Europe's Suns with softer dyes Mark Europe's favour'd progeny! Low is my stature, black my hair, The emblem of my Soul's despair! My voice no dulcet cadence flings, To touch soft pity's throbbing strings; Then wherefore, cruel Briton, say, Compel my aching heart to stay? To-morrow's Sun may rise to see The famish'd Lascar blest as thee!” The morn had scarcely shed its rays, When from the City's din he ran; For he had fasted four long days, And faint his Pilgrimage began! The Lascar now, without a friend, Up the steep hill did slow ascend; Now o'er the flow'ry meadows stole, While pain and hunger pinch'd his soul; And now his fev'rish lip was dried, And burning tears his thirst supply'd, And ere he saw the Ev'ning close, Far off, the City dimly rose. Again the Summer Sun flam'd high, The plains were golden far and wide; And fervid was the cloudless sky, And slow the breezes seem'd to glide: The gossamer, on briar and spray, Shone silv'ry in the solar ray; And sparkling dew-drops, falling round, Spangled the hot and thirsty ground; The insect myriads humm'd their tune To greet the coming hour of noon, While the poor Lascar Boy, in haste, Flew, frantic, o'er the sultry waste. And whither could the wand'rer go? Who would receive a stranger poor? Who, when the blasts of night should blow, Would ope to him the friendly door? Alone, amid the race of man, The sad, the fearful alien ran! None would an Indian wand'rer bless; None greet him with the fond caress; None feed him, though with hunger keen He at the lordly gate were seen Prostrate, and humbly forc'd to crave A shelter for an Indian Slave. The noon-tide Sun, now flaming wide, No cloud its fierce beam shadow'd o'er, But what could worse to him betide Than begging at the proud man's door? For clos'd and lofty was the gate, And there, in all the pride of state, A surly Porter turn'd the key, A man of sullen soul was he— His brow was fair; but in his eye Sat pamper'd scorn, and tyranny; And near him a fierce Mastiff stood, Eager to bathe his fangs in blood. The weary Lascar turn'd away, For trembling fear his heart subdued, And down his cheek the tear would stray, Though burning anguish drank his blood! The angry Mastiff snarl'd as he Turn'd from the house of luxury; The sultry hour was long, and high The broad-sun flam'd athwart the sky— But still a throbbing hope possess'd The Indian wand'rer's fev'rish breast, When from the distant dell a sound Of swelling music echo'd round. It was the church-bell's merry peal; And now a pleasant house he view'd: And now his heart began to feel As though it were not quite subdu'd! No lofty dome shew'd loftier state, No pamper'd Porter watch'd the gate, No Mastiff like a tyrant stood, Eager to scatter human blood; Yet the poor Indian wand'rer found, E'en where Religion smil'd around, That tears had little pow'r to speak When trembling on a sable cheek! With keen reproach, and menace rude, The Lascar Boy away was sent; And now again he seem'd subdu'd, And his soul sicken'd as he went. Now on the river's bank he stood; Now drank the cool refreshing flood; Again his fainting heart beat high; Again he rais'd his languid eye; Then from the upland's sultry side Look'd back, forgave the wretch, and sigh'd! While the proud pastor bent his way To preach of charity—and pray! PART SECOND. The Lascar Boy still journey'd on, For the hot Sun he well could bear, And now the burning hour was gone, And Evening came, with softer air. The breezes kiss'd his sable breast, While his scorch'd feet the cold dew prest; The waving flow'rs soft tears display'd, And songs of rapture fill'd the glade; The South-wind quiver'd, o'er the stream Reflecting back the rosy beam; While as the purpling twilight clos'd, On a turf bed—the boy repos'd. And now, in fancy's airy dream, The Lascar Boy his Mother spied; And from her breast a crimson stream Slow trickled down her beating side: And now he heard her wild, complain, As loud she shriek'd—but shriek'd in vain! And now she sunk upon the ground, The red stream trickling from her wound; And near her feet a murd'rer stood, His glitt'ring poniard tipp'd with blood! And now, “farewell, my son!” she cried, Then clos'd her fainting eyes—and died! The Indian Wand'rer, waking, gaz'd, With grief, and pain, and horror, wild; And tho' his fev'rish brain was craz'd, He rais'd his eyes to Heav'n, and smil'd: And now the stars were twinkling clear, And the blind Bat was whirling near, And the lone Owlet shriek'd, while he Still sate beneath a shelt'ring tree; And now the fierce-ton'd midnight blast Across the wide heath howling past, When a long cavalcade he spied By torch-light near the river's side. He rose, and hast'ning swiftly on, Call'd loudly to the sumptuous train, But soon the cavalcade was gone, And darkness wrapp'd the scene again. He follow'd still the distant sound; He saw the lightning flashing round; He heard the crashing thunder roar; He felt the whelming torrents pour; And now, beneath a shelt'ring wood, He listen'd to the tumbling flood— And now, with falt'ring, feeble breath, The famish'd Lascar pray'd for Death. And now the flood began to rise, And foaming rush'd along the vale; The Lascar watch'd, with stedfast eyes, The flash descending quick and pale; And now again the cavalcade Pass'd slowly near the upland glade; But he was dark, and dark the scene, The torches long extinct had been; He call'd, but in the stormy hour His feeble voice had lost its pow'r, Till, near a tree, beside the flood, A night-bewilder'd Trav'ller stood. The Lascar now with transport ran, “Stop! stop!” he cried, with accents bold; The Trav'ller was a fearful man, And next his life he priz'd his gold. He heard the wand'rer madly cry; He heard his footsteps following nigh; He nothing saw, while onward prest, Black as the sky, the Indian's breast Till his firm grasp he felt; while cold Down his pale cheek the big drop roll'd; Then, struggling to be free, he gave A deep wound to the Lascar Slave. And now he groan'd, by pain opprest, And now crept onward, sad and slow: And while he held his bleeding breast He feebly pour'd the plaint of woe: “What have I done!” the Lascar cried “That Heaven to me the pow'r denied To touch the soul of man, and share A brother's love, a brother's care? Why is this dingy form decreed To bear oppression's scourge and bleed? Is there a God in yon dark Heav'n, And shall such monsters be forgiv'n? “Here, in this smiling land we find Neglect and mis'ry sting our race; And still, whate'er the Lascar's mind, The stamp of sorrow marks his face!” He ceas'd to speak; while from his side Fast roll'd life's sweetly-ebbing tide, And now, though sick and faint was he, He slowly climb'd a tall elm tree, To watch if near his lonely way Some friendly Cottage lent a ray, A little ray of chearful light, To gild the Lascar's long, long night! And now he hears a distant bell, His heart is almost rent with joy! And who but such a wretch can tell The transports of the Indian boy? And higher now he climbs the tree, And hopes some shelt'ring Cot to see; Again he listens, while the peal Seems up the woodland vale to steal; The twinkling stars begin to fade, And dawnlight purples o'er the glade; And while the sev'ring vapours flee The Lascar Boy looks chearfully. And now the Sun begins to rise Above the Eastern summit blue; And o'er the plain the day-breeze flies, And sweetly bloom the fields of dew. The wand'ring wretch was chill'd, for he Sate shivering in the tall elm tree; And he was faint, and sick, and dry, And blood-shot was his fev'rish eye; And livid was his lip, while he Sate silent in the tall elm tree, And parch'd his tongue, and quick his breath, And his dark cheek was cold as Death! And now a Cottage low he sees, The chimney smoke, ascending grey, Floats lightly on the morning breeze And o'er the mountain glides away. And now the Lark, on flutt'ring wings, Its early song, delighted, sings; And now, across the upland mead, The Swains their flocks to shelter lead; The shelt'ring woods wave to and fro; The yellow plains far distant glow; And all things wake to life and joy, All! but the famish'd Indian Boy! And now the village throngs are seen, Each lane is peopled, and the glen From ev'ry op'ning path-way green Sends forth the busy hum of men. They cross the meads, still, all alone, They hear the wounded Lascar groan! Far off they mark the wretch, as he Falls, senseless, from the tall elm tree! Swiftly they cross the river wide, And soon they reach the elm tree's side; But ere the sufferer they behold, His wither'd Heart is dead—and cold! THE SHEPHERD'S DOG. A shepherd's Dog there was; and he Was faithful to his master's will, For well he lov'd his company Along the plain or up the hill; All seasons were to him the same, Beneath the sun's meridian flame; Or when the wint'ry wind blew shrill and keen, Still the Old Shepherd's Dog was with his master seen. His form was shaggy clothed; yet he Was of a bold and faithful breed, And kept his master company In smiling days, and days of need; When the long ev'ning slowly clos'd, When ev'ry living thing repos'd, When e'en the breeze slept on the woodlands round, The Shepherd's watchful Dog was ever waking found. All night upon the cold turf he Contented lay, with list'ning care; And though no stranger company, Or lonely traveller rested there, Old Trim was pleas'd to guard it still; For 'twas his aged master's will:— And so pass'd on the chearful night and day, 'Till the poor Shepherd's Dog was very old and grey. Among the villagers was he Belov'd by all the young and old; For he was cheerful company When the north wind blew keen and cold: And when the cottage scarce was warm, While round it flew the midnight storm, When loudly, fiercely roll'd the swelling tide— The Shepherd's faithful Dog crept closely by his side. When Spring in gaudy dress would be Sporting across the meadows green, He kept his master company, And all amid the flow'rs was seen; Now barking loud, now pacing fast, Now backward he a look would cast, And now, subdu'd and weak with frolic play, Amid the waving grass the Shepherd's Dog would stay. Now, up the rugged path would he The steep hill's summit slowly gain, And still be cheerful company, Though shiv'ring in the pelting rain; And when the brook was frozen o'er, Or the deep snow conceal'd the moor, When the pale moon-beams scarcely shed a ray, The Shepherd's faithful Dog would mark the dang'rous way. On Sunday, at the old yew tree, Which canopies the church-yard stile, Forc'd from his master's company, The faithful Trim would mope awhile; For then his master's only care Was the loud psalm, or fervent pray'r; And, 'till the throng the church-yard path retrod, The Shepherd's patient guard lay silent on the sod. Near their small hovel stood a tree, Where Trim was ev'ry morning found— Waiting his master's company, And looking wistfully around; And if, along the upland mead, He heard him tune the merry reed, O then! o'er hedge and ditch, thro' brake and briar, The Shepherd's dog would haste, with eyes that seem'd on fire. And now he pac'd the valley free, And now he bounded o'er the dew, For well his master's company Would recompence his toil he knew; And where a rippling rill was seen Flashing the woody brakes between, Fearless of danger, thro' the lucid tide The Shepherd's eager dog, yelping with joy, would glide. Full many a year the same was he, His love still stronger every day, For in his master's company He had grown old, and very grey; And now his sight grew dim; and slow Up the rough mountain he would go, And his loud bark, which all the village knew, With ev'ry wasting hour, more faint and peevish grew. One morn to the low mead went he, Rous'd from his threshold-bed, to meet A gay and lordly company!— The sun was bright, the air was sweet; Old Trim was watchful of his care, His master's flocks were feeding there; And, fearful of the hounds, he yelping stood Beneath a willow tree, that wav'd across the flood. Old Trim was urg'd to wrath, for he Was guardian of the meadow bounds; And, heedless of the company, With angry snarl attack'd the hounds! Some felt his teeth, though they were old, For still his ire was fierce and bold; And ne'er did valiant chieftain feel more strong Than the Old Shepherd's Dog, when daring foes among. The sun was setting o'er the sea, The breezes murmuring sad and slow, When a gay lordly company Came to the Shepherd's hovel low; Their arm'd associates stood around The sheep-cote fence's narrow bound, While its poor master heard, with fix'd despair, That Trim, his friend, deem'd mad, was doom'd to perish there! The kind old Shepherd wept, for he Had no such guide to mark his way, And, kneeling, pray'd the company To let him live his little day! “For many a year my dog has been The only friend these eyes have seen; We both are old and feeble, he and I— Together we have liv'd, together let us die! “Behold his dim, yet speaking eye! Which ill befits his visage grim; He cannot from your anger fly, For slow and feeble is old Trim! He looks as though he fain would speak,— His beard is white—his voice is weak— He is not mad! O! then, in pity spare The only watchful friend of my small fleecy care!” The Shepherd ceas'd to speak, for he Leant on his maple staff subdu'd; While pity touch'd the company, And all poor Trim with sorrow view'd: Nine days upon a willow bed Old Trim was doom'd to lay his head, Oppress'd and sever'd from his master's door, Enough to make him mad—were he not so before. But not forsaken yet was he, For ev'ry morn, at peep of day, To keep his old friend company The lonely Shepherd bent his way: A little boat across the stream, Which glitter'd in the sunny beam, Bore him, where foes no longer could annoy, Where Trim stood yelping loud, and almost mad with joy! Six days had pass'd, and still was he Upon the island left to roam, When on the stream a wither'd tree Was gliding rapid 'midst the foam! The little boat now onward prest, Danc'd o'er the river's bounding breast, Till dash'd impetuous 'gainst the old tree's side, The Shepherd plung'd and groan'd, then sunk amid the tide. Old Trim, now doom'd his friend to see Beating the foam with wasted breath, Resolv'd to bear him company E'en in the icy arms of death: Soon with exulting cries he bore His feeble master to the shore, And, standing o'er him, howl'd in cadence sad, For fear and fondness now had nearly made him mad. Together still their flocks they tend, More happy than the proudly great; The Shepherd has no other friend— No lordly home, no bed of state! But on a pallet, clean and low, They hear unmov'd the wild winds blow; And though they ne'er another spring may see, The Shepherd and his Dog are chearful company. DEBORAH'S PARROT. A VILLAGE TALE. 'Twas in a little western town An ancient Maiden dwelt: Her name was Miss, or Mistress, Brown, Or Deborah, or Debby: She Was doom'd a spinster pure to be, For soft delights her breast ne'er felt: Yet, she had watchful ears and eyes For ev'ry youthful neighbour, And never did she cease to labour A tripping female to surprize. And why was she so wond'rous pure, So stiff, so solemn—so demure? Why did she watch with so much care The roving youth, the wand'ring fair? The tattler, Fame, has said that she A spinster's life had long detested, But 'twas her quiet destiny Never to be molested!— And had Miss Debby's form been grac'd, Fame adds,—She had not been so chaste;— But since for frailty she would roam, She ne'er was taught—to look at home. Miss Debby was of mien demure, And blush'd like any maid! She could not saucy man endure, Lest she should be betray'd! She never fail'd at dance or fair To watch the wily lurcher's snare; At church she was a model godly! Though sometimes she had diff'rent eyes Than those uplifted to the skies, Leering most oddly! And Scandal, ever busy, thought She rarely practic'd—what she taught. Her dress was always stiff brocade, With laces broad and dear; Fine cobwebs! that would thinly shade Her shrivell'd cheek of sallow hue, While, like a spider, her keen eye, Which never shed soft pity's tear, Small holes in othors geer could spy, And miscroscopic follies prying view. And sorely vex'd was ev'ry simple thing That wander'd near her never-tiring sting! Miss Debby had a Parrot, who, If Fame speaks true, Could prate, and tell what neighbours did, And yet the saucy rogue was never chid! Sometimes he talk'd of roving spouses Who wander'd from their quiet houses: Sometimes he call'd a spinster pure By names that virtue can't indure! And sometimes told an ancient dame Such tales as made her blush with shame! Then gabbled how a giddy miss Would give the boist'rous squire a kiss! But chiefly he was taught to cry, “Who with the parson toy'd? O fie!” This little joke Miss Debby taught him, To vex a young and pretty neighbour; But by her scandal-zealous labour To shame she brought him! For the old Parrot, like his teacher, Was but a false and canting preacher, And many a gamesome pair had sworn Such lessons were not to be borne. At last, Miss Debby sore was flouted, And by her angry neighbours scouted; She never knew one hour of rest,— Of ev'ry saucy boor the jest: The young despis'd her, and the sage Look'd back on Time's impartial page: They knew that youth was giv'n to prove The season of extatic joy, That none but cynics would destroy The early buds of Love. They also knew that Debby sigh'd For charms that envious Time deny'd; That she was vex'd with jealous spleen That Hymen pass'd her by, unseen. For though the spinster's wealth was known, Gold will not purchase Love—alone. She and her Parrot now were thought The torments of their little sphere: He, because mischievously taught, And she, because a maid austere!— In short, she deem'd it wise to leave A place, where none remain'd to grieve. Soon, to a distant town remov'd, Miss Debby's gold an husband bought; And all she had her Parrot taught (Her Parrot now no more belov'd) Was quite forgotten. But, alas! As Fate would have it come to pass, Her spouse was giv'n to jealous rage; For, both in person and in age, He was the partner of his love, Ordain'd her second self to prove! One day, Old Jenkins had been out With merry friends to dine, And, freely talking, had no doubt Been also free with wine. One said, of all the wanton gay In the whole parish, search it round, None like the Parson could be found, Where a frail maid was in the way. Another thought the Parson sure To win the heart of maid or wife; And would have freely pledg'd his life That, young or old, or rich or poor, None could defy The magic of his roving eye! Jenkins went home, but all the night He dream'd of this strange tale! Yet bless'd his stars, with proud delight, His partner was not young, nor frail. Next morning, at the breakfast table, The Parrot, loud as he was able, Was heard repeatedly to cry, “Who with the parson toy'd? O fie!” Old Jenkins listen'd, and grew pale, The Parrot then more loudly scream'd; And Mistress Jenkins heard the tale, And much alarm'd she seem'd! Trembling, she tried to stop his breath, Her lips and cheek as pale as death! The more she trembled, still the more Old Jenkins view'd her o'er and o'er: And now her yellow cheek was spread With blushes of the deepest red. And now again the Parrot's tale Made his old tutoress doubly pale; For cowardice and guilt, they say, Are the twin brothers of the soul: So Mistress Jenkins her dismay Could not controul! While the accuser, now grown bold, Thrice o'er the tale of mischief told. Now Jenkins from the table rose, “Who with the parson toy'd?” he cried. “So, Mistress Frailty, you must play And sport your wanton hours away. And with your gold, a pretty joke, You thought to buy a pleasant cloak, A screen to hide your shame—but know I will not blind to ruin go.— I am no modern spouse, d'ye see, Gold will not gild disgrace, with me!” Some say he seiz'd his fearful bride, And came to blows! Day after day the contest dire Augmented, with resistless ire! And many a drubbing Debby bought For mischief she her Parrot taught! Thus, Slander turns against its maker: And if this little story reaches A Spinster who her Parrot teaches, Let her a better task pursue, And here the certain Vengeance view Which surely will, in time, o'ertake her. THE MURDERED MAID. High on the solitude of Alpine Hills, O'er-topping the grand imag'ry of Nature, Where one eternal winter seems to reign, An Hermit's threshold, carpetted with moss, Diversified the scene. Above the flakes Of silv'ry snow, full many a modest flow'r Peep'd through its icy veil, and blushing op'd Its variegated hues; the Orchis sweet, The bloomy Cistus, and the fragrant branch Of glossy Myrtle. In his rushy cell The lonely Anchoret consum'd his days, Unnotic'd and unblest. In early youth, Cross'd in the fond affections of his soul By false Ambition, from his parent home He solitary wander'd; while the Maid, Whose peerless beauty won his yielding heart, Pined in monastic horrors! Near his sill A little cross he rear'd, where prostrate low, At day's pale glimpse, or when the setting sun Tissued the western sky with streamy gold, His orisons he pour'd, for her whose hours Were wasted in oblivion. Winters pass'd, And summers faded, slow, unchearly all To the lone Hermit's sorrows: For still Love A dark, though unpolluted, altar rear'd On the white waste of wonders! From the peak Which mark'd his neighb'ring hut, his humid eye Oft wander'd o'er the rich expanse below; Oft trac'd the glow of vegetating spring, The full-blown summer splendours, and the hue Of tawny scenes autumnal: Vineyards vast Clothing the upland scene, and spreading wide The promised tide nectareous; while for him The liquid lapse of the slow brook was seen Flashing amid the trees its silv'ry wave! Far distant the blue mist of waters rose, Veiling the ridgy outline, faintly grey, Blended with clouds, and shutting out the sun. The seasons still revolv'd, and still was he By all forgotten, save by her, whose breast Sigh'd in responsive sadness to the gale That swept her prison turrets. Five long years Had seen his graces wither, ere his spring Of life was wasted. From the social scenes Of human energy an alien driv'n, He almost had forgot the face of Man.— No voice had met his ear, save when perchance The pilgrim wand'rer, or the goatherd swain, Bewilder'd in the starless midnight hour, Implored the Hermit's aid, the Hermit's pray'rs; And nothing loath, by pity or by pray'r Was he to save the wretched. On the top Of his low rushy dome, a tinkling bell Oft told the weary trav'ller to approach Fearless of danger. The small silver sound In quick vibrations echo'd down the dell To the dim vallies quiet, while the breeze Slept on the glassy Leman. Thus he past His melancholy days, an alien man From all the joys of social intercourse, Alone, unpitied, by the world forgot! His scrip each morning bore the day's repast Gather'd on summits mingling with the clouds, From whose bleak altitude the eye look'd down, While fast the giddy brain was rock'd by fear. Oft would he start from visionary rest, When roaming wolves their midnight chorus howl'd, Or blasts tremendous shatter'd the white cliffs, While the huge fragments, rifted by the storm, Plung'd to the dell below. Oft would he sit In silent sadness on the jutting block Of snow-encrusted ice, and shudd'ring mark (Amid the wonders of the frozen world) Dissolving pyramids, and threatening peaks, Hang o'er his hovel, terribly sublime. And oft, when summer breath'd ambrosial gales, Soft sailing o'er the waste of printless dew Or twilight gossamer, his pensive gaze Trac'd the swift storm advancing, whose broad wing Blacken'd the rushy dome of his low hut; While the pale lightning smote the pathless top Of tow'ring Cenis, scatt'ring high and wide A mist of fleecy snow. Then would he hear (While Mem'ry brought to view his happier days) The tumbling torrent, bursting wildly forth From its thaw'd prison, sweep the shaggy cliff Vast and stupendous! strength'ning as it fell, And delving, 'mid the snow, a cavern rude! So liv'd the Hermit, like an hardy tree Plac'd on a mountain's solitary brow, And destin'd, thro' the seasons, to endure Their wond'rous changes. To behold the face Of ever-varying Nature, and to mark In each grand lineament the work of God! And happier he, in total solitude, Than the poor toil-worn wretch, whose ardent soul That God has nobly organiz'd, but taught, For purposes unknown, to bear the scourge Of sharp adversity and vulgar pride. Happier, O! happier far, than those who feel, Yet live amongst the unfeeling! feeding still The throbbing heart with anguish or with scorn. One dreary night, when winter's icy breath Half petrified the scene, when not a star Gleam'd o'er the bleak infinity of space, Sudden the Hermit started from his couch With painful agitation. On his cheek The blanch'd interpreter of horror mute Sat terribly impressive! In his breast The ruddy fount of life convulsive flow'd, And his broad eyes, fix'd motionless as death, Gaz'd vacantly aghast! His feeble lamp Was wasting rapidly; the biting gale Pierc'd the thin texture of his narrow cell; And silence, like a fearful centinel Marking the peril which awaited near, Conspir'd with sullen night to wrap the scene In tenfold horrors. Thrice he rose, and thrice His feet recoil'd; and still the livid flame Lengthen'd and quiver'd as the moaning wind Pass'd thro' the rushy crevice, while his heart Beat, like the death-watch, in his shudd'ring breast. Like the pale image of Despair he sat, The cold drops pacing down his hollow cheek, When a deep groan assail'd his startled ear, And rous'd him into action. To the sill Of his low hovel he rush'd forth, (for fear Will sometimes take the shape of fortitude, And force men into bravery) and soon The wicker bolt unfasten'd. The swift blast, Now unrestrain'd, flew by; and in its course The quiv'ring lamp extinguish'd, and again His soul was thrill'd with terror. On he went, Even to the snow-fring'd margin of the crag, Which to his citadel a platform made, Slipp'ry and perilous! 'Twas darkness, all! All solitary gloom!—The concave vast Of Heav'n frown'd chaos; for all varied things Of air, and earth, and waters blended, lost Their forms in blank oblivion! Yet not long Did Nature wear her sable panoply: For, while the Hermit listen'd, from below A stream of light ascended, spreading round A partial view of trackless solitudes; And mingling voices seem'd, with busy hum, To break the spell of horrors. Down the steep The Hermit hasten'd, when a shriek of death Re-echoed to the valley. As he flew, (The treach'rous pathway yielding to his speed,) Half hoping, half despairing, to the scene Of wonder-waking anguish, suddenly The torches were extinct, and second night Came doubly hideous; while the hollow tongues Of cavern'd winds, with melancholy sound, Increas'd the Hermit's fears. Four freezing hours He watch'd and pray'd: and now the glimm'ring dawn Peer'd on the eastern summits; (the blue light Shedding cold lustre on the colder brows Of Alpine desarts;) while the filmy wing Of weeping twilight swept the naked plains Of the Lombardian landscape. On his knees The Anchoret blest Heav'n, that he had 'scap'd The many perilous and fearful falls Of waters wild and foamy, tumbling fast From the shagg'd altitude. But, ere his pray'rs Rose to their destin'd Heav'n, another sight, Than all preceding far more terrible, Palsied devotion's ardour. On the snow, Dappled with ruby drops, a track was made By steps precipitate; a rugged path Down the steep frozen chasm had mark'd the fate Of some night traveller, whose bleeding form Had toppled from the summit. Lower still The Anchoret descended, 'till arrived At the first ridge of silv'ry battlements, Where, lifeless, ghastly, paler than the snow On which her cheek repos'd, his darling Maid Slept in the dream of Death! Frantic and wild He clasp'd her stiff'ning form, and bath'd with tears The lilies of her bosom—icy cold— Yet beautiful and spotless. Now, afar The wond'ring Hermit heard the clang of arms Re-echoing from the valley: the white cliffs Trembled as though an earthquake shook their base With terrible concussion! Thund'ring peals From warfare's brazen throat, proclaim'd the approach Of conquering legions: onward they extend Their dauntless columns! In the foremost group A ruffian met the Hermit's startled eyes, Like hell's worst demon! For his murd'rous hands Were smear'd with gore; and on his daring breast A golden cross, suspended, bore the name Of his ill-fated victim! To his cell The soul-struck exile turn'd his trembling feet, And after three lone weeks of pain and pray'r, Shrunk from the scene of solitude—and died! THE NEGRO GIRL. Dark was the dawn, and o'er the deep The boist'rous whirlwinds blew; The Sea-bird wheel'd its circling sweep, And all was drear to view, When on the beach that binds the western shore The love-lorn Zelma stood, list'ning the tempest's roar. Her eager Eyes beheld the main, While on her Draco dear She madly call'd, but call'd in vain, No sound could Draco hear, Save the shrill yelling of the fateful blast, While ev'ry Seaman's heart quick shudder'd as it past. White were the billows, wide display'd The clouds were black and low; The Bittern shriek'd, a gliding shade Seem'd o'er the waves to go! The livid flash illum'd the clam'rous main, While Zelma pour'd, unmark'd, her melancholy strain. “Be still!” she cries, “loud tempest cease! O! spare the gallant souls!” The thunder rolls—the winds increase— The Sea like mountains rolls. While from the deck the the storm-worn victims leap, And o'er their struggling limbs the furious billows sweep. “O! barb'rous Pow'r! relentless Fate! Does Heaven's high will decree That some should sleep on beds of state— Some in the roaring Sea? Some nurs'd in splendour deal Oppression's blow, While worth and Draco pine—in Slavery and woe! “Yon vessel oft has plough'd the main With human traffic fraught; Its cargo—our dark Sons of pain— For worldly treasure bought! What had they done? O Nature tell me why Is taunting scorn the lot of thy dark progeny? “Thou gav'st, in thy caprice, the Soul Peculiarly enshrin'd; Nor from the ebon Casket stole The Jewel of the mind! Then wherefore let the suff'ring Negro's breast Bow to his fellow man, in brighter colours drest. “Is it the dim and glossy hue That marks him for despair? While men with blood their hands embrue, And mock the wretch's pray'r, Shall guiltless Slaves the scourge of tyrants feel, And, e'en before their God! unheard, unpitied kneel. “Could the proud rulers of the land Our Sable race behold; Some bow'd by Torture's giant hand, And other's basely sold! Then would they pity Slaves, and cry, with shame, Whate'er their tints may be, their souls are still the same! “Why seek to mock the Ethiop's face? Why goad our hapless kind? Can features alienate the race— Is there no kindred mind? Does not the cheek which vaunts the roseate hue Oft blush for crimes that Ethiops never knew? “Behold! the angry waves conspire To check the barb'rous toil! While wounded Nature's vengeful ire Roars round this trembling Isle! And hark! her voice re-echoes in the wind— Man was not form'd by Heav'n to trample on his kind! “Torn from my mother's aching breast, My Tyrant sought my love— But in the grave shall Zelma rest, Ere she will faithless prove; No, Draco!—Thy companion I will be To that celestial realm where Negros shall be free! “The Tyrant white man taught my mind The letter'd page to trace; He taught me in the Soul to find No tint, as in the face: He bade my reason blossom like the tree— But fond affection gave the ripen'd fruits to thee. “With jealous rage he mark'd my love; He sent thee far away; And prison'd in the plaintain grove Poor Zelma pass'd the day; But ere the moon rose high above the main Zelma and Love contriv'd to break the Tyrant's chain. “Swift, o'er the plain of burning Sand My course I bent to thee; And soon I reach'd the billowy strand Which bounds the stormy Sea. Draco! my Love! Oh yet thy Zelma's soul Springs ardently to thee, impatient of controul. “Again the lightning flashes white The rattling cords among! Now, by the transient vivid light, I mark the frantic throng! Now up the tatter'd shrouds my Draco flies, While o'er the plunging prow the curling billows rise. “The topmast falls—three shackled slaves Cling to the Vessel's side! Now lost amid the madd'ning waves— Now on the mast they ride— See! on the forecastle my Draco stands, And he now he waves his chain, now clasps his bleeding hands. “Why, “cruel white-man! when away My sable Love was torn, Why did you let poor Zelma stay, On Afric's sands to mourn? No! Zelma is not left, for she will prove In the deep troubled main her fond—her faithful Love!” The lab'ring Ship was now a wreck, The shrouds were flutt'ring wide; The rudder gone, the lofty deck Was rock'd from side to side— Poor Zelma's eyes now dropp'd their last big tear, While from her tawny cheek the blood recoil'd with fear. Now frantic, on the sands she roam'd, Now shrieking stopp'd to view Where high the liquid mountains foam'd Around the exhausted crew— 'Till, from the deck, her Draco's well-known form Sprung 'mid the yawning waves, and buffetted the storm. Long, on the swelling surge sustain'd, Brave Draco sought the shore, Watch'd the dark Maid, but ne'er complain'd, Then sunk, to gaze no more! Poor Zelma saw him buried by the wave, And, with her heart's true Love, plung'd in a wat'ry grave. THE DESERTED COTTAGE. Who dwelt in yonder lonely Cot? Why is it thus forsaken? It seems by all the world forgot, Above its path the high grass grows, And through its thatch the north-wind blows —Its thatch by tempests shaken. And yet it tops a verdant hill By Summer gales surrounded: Beneath its door a shallow rill Runs brawling to the vale below, And near it sweetest flowrets grow By banks of willow bounded. Then why is ev'ry casement dark? Why looks the Cot so chearless? Ah! why does ruin seem to mark The calm retreat where Love should dwell, And Friendship teach the heart to swell With rapture pure and fearless? There, far above the busy croud, Man may repose in quiet; There smile that he has left the proud, And blest with liberty, enjoy More than Ambition's gilded toy, Or Folly's sick'ning riot. For there, the ever tranquil mind, On calm Religion resting, May in each lonely labyrinth find The Deity, whose boundless pow'r Directs the blast, or tints the flow'r— No mortal foe molesting. Stranger, yon spot was once the scene Where peace and joy resided: And oft the merry time has been When Love and Friendship warm'd the breast, And Freedom, making wealth a jest, The pride of Pomp derided. Old Jacob was the Cottage Lord, His wide domain surrounding By Nature's treasure amply stor'd; He from his casement could behold The breezy mountain, ting'd with gold, The varied landscape bounding! The coming morn, with lustre gay, Breath'd sweetly on his dwelling; The twilight veil of parting day Stole softly o'er his quiet shed, Hiding the mountain's misty head, Where the night-breeze was swelling. One lovely Girl Old Jacob rear'd, And she was fair and blooming; She like the morning Star appear'd, Swift gliding o'er the mountain's crest, While her blue eyes her soul confess'd, No borrow'd rays assuming. 'Twas her's the vagrant lamb to lead, To watch the wild goat playing; To join the Shepherd's tuneful reed, And, when the sultry Sun rose high, To tend the herds, deep-lowing nigh, Where the swift brook was straying. One sturdy Boy, a younker bold, Ere they were doom'd to sever, Maintain'd poor Jacob, sick and old; But now, where yon tall poplars wave, Pale primroses adorn the grave— Where Jacob sleeps, for Ever! Young, in the wars, the brave Boy fell! His Sister died of sadness! But one remain'd their fate to tell, For Jacob now was left alone, And he, alas! was helpless grown, And pin'd in moody madness. At night, by moonshine would he stray Along the upland dreary; And, talking wildly all the way, Would fancy, 'till the Sun uprose, That Heav'n, in pity, mark'd the woes Of which his soul was weary. One morn, upon the dewy grass Poor Jacob's sorrows ended, The woodland's narrow winding pass Was his last scene of lonely care, For, gentle Stranger, lifeless there Was Jacob's form extended! He lies beneath yon poplar tree That tops the church-yard, sighing: For sighing oft it seems to be, And as its waving leaves, around, With morning's tears begem the ground The Zephyr trembles, flying. And now behold yon little Cot All dreary and forsaken; And know, that soon 'twill be thy lot To fall, like Jacob and his race, And leave on Time's swift wing no trace Which way thy course is taken. Yet, if for Truth and feeling known, Thou still shalt be lamented: For when thy parting sigh has flown, Fond Mem'ry on thy grave shall give A tear—to bid thy virtues live! Then—Smile, and be contented! TO AN INFANT SLEEPING. Sweet Baby Boy! thy soft cheek glows An emblem of the living rose; Thy breath a zephyr seems to rise, And placid are thy half-clos'd eyes; And silent is thy snowy breast, Which gently heaves in transient rest; And dreaming is thy infant brain Of pleasure undisturb'd by pain. Soon will thy Youth to sorrow rise, And tears will dim those half-clos'd eyes; And storms shall fade that living rose, And keen unkindness wound repose. Soon will thy slumbers painful be, And thou wilt watch and weep—like me! And thou wilt shrink with fear aghast From wild Misfortune's chilling blast. Ah! then no more in balmy sleep Shall mem'ry fond her garland steep; No more shall visions sweetly gay Sport in the coming beams of day; No more thy downy pillow be A pillow, Boy, of down for thee! For many a thorn shall ruthless Care In envious rancour scatter there! Sweet Baby Boy! then sleep awhile, For Youth will never wake to smile; Time flings its poisons round the bed Where Manhood lays his weary head: The summer day of life will lour As long, Poor Boy, as winter's hour, Unless the goddess Fortune brings The magic of her golden wings! A MADRIGAL. Oh! sad and watchful waits the Lover Whose fate depends upon a smile, Who counts the weary minutes over, And chides his flutt'ring heart the while. Oh! proud and madd'ning is the pleasure When to my sight thy form appears, Array'd in Nature's winning treasure Of blushing hopes and graceful fears. Then, rose of beauty, haste and cheer me, With lips like rubies come and smile; Ah! trust my faith, and do not fear me, I love too fondly to beguile! The false and cunning may allure thee, And win thee only to betray; I would not, Lady, so secure thee, Nor win thy favour for a day. Then come and bless me, Nature's treasure! Oh! come and bid my sorrows fly; Instruct my heart to throb with pleasure, Or bid me cease to hope—and die! Ah! rose of beauty, since thy lover For thee a thousand lives would give, One grateful thought at least discover, One little sigh to bid him—live! TO THE WANDERER. Welcome! once more, to this sad breast, Where pain and sorrow dwell; Where feeling bids the quick pulse tell How long this heart has sigh'd for rest: Welcome, O Mem'ry, to this brain, Which long has throbb'd with fev'rish pain; For thou in ev'ry thought canst prove That Time has never flown from Love. Reproach me not, with icy scorn, The fault was ever thine; For thou awhile wert pleas'd to twine With Hope's fair flow'rs Affliction's thorn. Thou by caprice and folly led, In all my paths its influence shed, And bad my sighing spirit prove That weary Time could menace Love! Then wonder not, if months and years, I strove to fly from thee, If vainly struggling to be free, I bath'd the bonds of truth with tears! Ah! wonder not that others tried To touch the deaden'd sense of Pride; That others sought awhile to prove How Time neglected flies from Love. Then O! forbear reproachful lays To mingle with thy fears; While Hope in lovely garb appears, With happier hours and calmer days. Thrice twelve long months have taught my mind The patient task of peace resign'd; And must I, ?, must I prove That Time has fail'd to vanquish Love! STANZAS TO FLORA. Let others wreaths of roses twine, With scented leaves of eglantine; Enamell'd buds and gaudy flow'rs, The pride of Flora's painted bow'rs; Such common charms shall ne'er be wove Around the brows of him I love. Fair are their beauties for a day, But swiftly do they fade away; Each Pink sends forth its choicest sweet Aurora's warm embrace to meet; And each inconstant breeze that blows Steals essence from the musky Rose. Then lead me, Flora, to the vale, Where, shelter'd from the fickle gale, In modest garb, amidst the gloom, The constant Myrtle sheds perfume; And hid secure from prying eyes, In spotless beauty blooms and dies. And should its velvet leaves dispense No pow'rful odours to the sense; Should no proud tints of gaudy hue With dazzling lustre pain the view; Still shall its verdant boughs defy The northern blast, and wintry sky. Ah, Venus! should this hand of mine Steal from thy tree a wreath divine, Assist me, while I fondly bind Two hearts, by holy Friendship join'd; Thy cherish'd branches then shall prove Sacred to Truth, as well as Love. STANZAS TO LOVE. Tell me, Love, when I rove o'er some far distant plain, Shall I cherish the passion that dwells in my breast? Or will Absence subdue the keen rigours of pain, And the swift wing of Time bring the balsam of rest? Shall the image of him I was born to adore Inshrin'd in my bosom my idol still prove! Or, seduced by caprice, shall fine feeling no more With the incense of truth gem the altar of Love? When I view the deep tint of the dew-dropping rose, Where the bee sits enamour'd its nectar to sip; Then, ah say! will not memory fondly disclose The softer vermilion that glow'd on his lip? Will the Sun, when he rolls in his chariot of fire, So dazzle my mind with the glare of his rays, That my senses one moment shall cease to admire The more perfect refulgence that beam'd in his lays? When the shadows of twilight steal over the plain, And the Nightingale pours its lorn plaint in the grove; Ah! will not the fondness that thrills thro' the strain, Then recall to my mind his dear accents of Love! Then spare, thou sweet Urchin, thou soother of pain, Oh! spare the soft picture engrav'd on my heart; As a record of Love let it ever remain; My bosom thy tablet—thy pencil a dart. LOVE AND REASON. Love said to Reason, “Know my pow'r, Nor vaunt thy pedant rules; I can the sweetest natures sour, And make the wisest fools. “I bid Philosophy submit, I make the dullest gay; To idiots lend a gleam of wit, Or darken Wisdom's ray. I can teach proud and freezing Scorn To feel my potent skill; The sternest face with smiles adorn, The cold with rapture thrill.” “'Tis true,” indignant Reason said, “Too much of pow'r's thy own: Yet 'tis where I refuse my aid, That only thou art known. “But Time, that conquers e'en thy art, Bids Reason's altar burn, And as he calms the fev'rish heart, I triumph in my turn.” TO A FRIEND. Cold blows the wind upon the mountain's brow; In murmuring cadence wave the leafless woods; The feath'ry tribe mope on the frozen bough, And icy fetters hold the silent floods: But endless Spring the Poet's breast shall prove, Whose Genius kindles at the torch of Love. For him, unfading, blooms the fertile mind, The current of the heart for ever flows; Fearless his bosom braves the wintry wind, While thro' each nerve eternal summer glows; In vain would chilling Apathy controul The lambent fire that warms the lib'ral soul! To me the limpid brook, the painted mead, The crimson dawn, the twilight's purple close; The mirthful dance, the shepherd's tuneful reed, The musky fragrance of the opening rose: To me, alas! all pleasures senseless prove, Save the sweet converse of the Friend I love. LIFE. “What is this world?—thy school, O misery! “Our only lesson is to learn to suffer.” YOUNG. Love, thou sportive fickle boy, Source of anguish, child of joy, Ever wounding—ever smiling, Soothing still, and still beguiling: What are all thy boasted treasures, Tender sorrows, transient pleasures? Anxious hopes, and jealous fears, Laughing hours, and mourning years. Fancy's balm for ev'ry wound, Ever sought, but rarely found! Deck'd with brightest tints at morn, At twilight with'ring on a thorn; Like the gentle rose of spring, Chill'd by ev'ry zephyr's wing: Ah! how soon its colour flies, Blushes, trembles, falls, and dies. What is Youth?—a smiling sorrow, Blithe to-day, and sad to-morrow; Never fix'd, for ever ranging, Laughing, weeping, doating, changing; Wild, capricious, giddy, vain, Cloy'd with pleasure, nurs'd with pain; Age steals on with wint'ry face, Ev'ry rapt'rous Hope to chase; Like a wither'd, sapless tree, Bow'd to chilling Fate's decree; Strip'd of all its foilage gay, Drooping at the close of day; What of tedious Life remains? Keen regrets and cureless pains; Till Death appears, a welcome friend, To bid the scene of sorrow end. TO ? “I will instruct my Sorrows to be Proud.” Shakespeare. 'Tis past! and now, remorseless Fate, Thy Victim braves thy direst hate, My mind resists thy poison'd dart, And conscious pride sustains my heart; Behold my placid smiles disclose, The pang is past that seal'd my woes! Since now, no more to grief a prey, My tranquil hours shall glide away; Since Reason from my sated brain Shall tear the records of past pain; Since warring passions sink to rest, And fierce resentment leaves my breast; Since from the wreath fond Fancy made, Hope's transient flow'rs for ever fade; One proud indignant tear shall prove The signal of expiring love. Sweet offspring of long cherish'd woe, No more thy glittering fount shall flow; But trembling in its azure cell, Conceal'd in haughty silence dwell; Or if, perchance, one drop should steal, The pangs of memory to reveal, On my cold bosom shalt thou shine, A peerless gem—on Feeling's shrine! Now if remorse can touch thy heart, Or gracious deeds one joy impart; O, if Reflection turns at last To all my proud affection past, Which shar'd each pang that wrung thy breast, And sooth'd thy wounded mind to rest; When soft-ey'd Sympathy entwin'd A feath'ry chain, thy heart to bind; And with responsive sighs dispell'd Each wayward passion that rebell'd: Calming with Friendship's dulcet sounds The anguish of dark Falsehood's wounds; When friends were cold, and foes severe, And smiling Envy stung thine ear; Who, with meek counsel, bade thee know The specious garb that veil'd the foe? And turning from thy breast his wound, Saw, in strong spells, the mischief bound? When Fortune, smiling on my lot, Illum'd with joy my favour'd cot; When sportive Love a wreath entwin'd, The graces of my breast to bind; When Youth rush'd forward to bestow On my warm lip the ruby's glow; When Health spread rapture o'er my cheek, That bade the blushing roses speak, And gave my eye the spark divine— Say, were not all these treasures thine? When lust'rous summer deck'd my bow'rs, And hung my couch with rarest flow'rs; When plenty crown'd my little board, With all abundant Nature stor'd; When social Mirth's enliv'ning strain Mock'd the dull groan of worldly pain; When e'en Philosophy confess'd That Love's pure flame could warm the breast; When Wisdom listen'd as I sung, To catch new precepts from my tongue;— Say, did such trivial flatteries move The heart enslav'd by thee and love? 'Tis past! now Reason's sober light Steals through the gloom of mental night; Since Love's fond tale can cheat no more, And e'en false Hope's bright dream is o'er. Come, gentle Peace! these eye-lids close On some blest pallet of repose; And thou, dear Muse, in pity give One wreath, to bid my Memory live: Then will I smile at envious Fate's decree, Forget my woes, myself, the world, and thee. TO A FALSE FRIEND. IN IMITATION OF SAPPHO. The seasons, lover false! are changing slow, And now Winter passes by on snowy wing; Swiftly the zephyrs bid their pinions go, Wafting the perfum'd harbinger of Spring! The Summer blushes as she steals away, And short, though splendid, is her glowing day! Then Autumn comes, in tawny graces drest, And in majestic solemn pomp retires; Rich are the trappings of her burning breast, And her broad eye flames undulating fires! I greet thee, Season! for my ardent soul Like thee, must own, the stormy hours controul! The Spring of joy no more shall bid me see Young budding blossoms of delightful hue! Nor shall luxuriant Summer smile for me; Nor thou, red Autumn, open to my view! Then come, thou season turbulent, and prove How weak thy storm oppos'd to hopeless love! In vain you fly me! on the madd'ning main Sappho shall haunt thee 'mid the whirlwind's roar; Sappho shall o'er the mountains chaunt her strain, And Echo bear it to thy distant shore! No scene upon the world's wide space shall be A scene of rest, ungrateful man, to thee! When the wind howls along the forest drear, Or faintly whispers on the curling sea, My voice upon the dying gale to hear Thou shalt awake—and call, in vain, on me! And when the morning beam illumes the sky, My faded form shall meet thy sleepless eye! False Lover! no, upon the tow'ring steep, Where Fame her temple rears, defying Time, Sappho shall mark unaw'd the bounding deep, And meet her fate with fortitude sublime! And while thy name to blank Oblivion fades, Sappho shall smiling seek th' Elysian shades. STANZAS TO A FRIEND. Ah! think no more that Life's delusive joys Can charm my thoughts from Friendship's dearer claim; Or wound a heart that scarce a wish employs, For age to censure, or discretion blame. Tir'd of the world, my weary mind recoils From splendid scenes and transitory joys; From fell Ambition's false and fruitless toils, From hope that flatters, and from bliss that cloys. With thee, above the taunts of empty pride, The rigid frowns to youthful error giv'n, Content in solitude my griefs I'll hide, Thy voice my counsellor, thy smiles my Heav'n. With thee I'll hail the morn's returning ray, Or climb the dewy mountain bleak and cold; On the smooth lake observe the sun-beams play, Or mark the infant flow'rs their buds unfold. Pleas'd will I watch the glitt'ring queen of night Spread her white mantle o'er the face of Heaven; And from thy converse snatch the pure delight, By truth sublime to mental feeling given. And as the varying seasons glide away, This moral lesson shall my bosom learn: How Time steals on, while blissful hours decay Like fleeting shadows—never to return! And when I see thy warm unspotted mind Torn with the wound of broken Friendship's dart; When sickness chills thy breast with pangs unkind, Or ruthless sorrow preys upon thy heart; The task be mine to soothe thee to repose, To check the sigh, and stay the trickling tear, Or with soft sympathy to share thy woes;— O proudest rapture of the soul sincere! And ye who flutter thro' the vacant hour, Where tasteless Apathy's empoison'd wand Arrests the vagrant sense with numbing pow'r, While vanquish'd Reason bows at her command; O say, what bliss can transient Life bestow, What balm so grateful to the social mind As Friendship's voice—where gentle precepts flow From the blest source of sentiment refin'd? When Fate's stern hand shall close my weeping eye, And seal, at length, my wand'ring spirit's doom; Oh! may kind Friendship catch my parting sigh, And cheer with Hope the terrors of the Tomb! STANZAS. [When fragrant gales and summer show'rs] When fragrant gales and summer show'rs Call'd forth the sweetly-scented flow'rs; When ripen'd sheaves of golden grain Strew'd their rich treasures o'er the plain; When the full grape did nectar yield, In tepid drops of purple hue; When the thick grove and thirsty field Drank the soft show'r, and bloom'd anew: O then my joyful heart did say, “Sure this is Nature's Holy-day!” But when the yellow leaf did fade, And every gentle flow'r decay'd; When whistling winds and drenching rain Swept with rude force the naked plain; When o'er the desolated scene I saw the drifted snow descend, And sadness darken'd all the green, And Nature's triumphs seem'd to end: O then my mourning heart did say, “Thus Youth shall vanish, Life decay!” When Beauty blooms, and Fortune smiles, And Wealth the easy breast beguiles; When Pleasure from her downy wings Her soft bewitching incense flings; Then Friends look kind—and round the heart The brightest flames of Passion move, False Flatt'ry's soothing strains impart The warmest Friendship, fondest Love: But when capricious Fortune flies, Then Friendship fades,—and Passion dies. LINES WRITTEN ON THE SEA-COAST. Swift o'er the bounding deep the Vessel glides, Its streamers flutt'ring in the summer gales, The lofty mast the breezy air derides, As gaily o'er the glitt'ring surf she sails. Now beats each gallant heart with innate joys, Bright hopes and tender fears alternate vie, Dear schemes of pure delight the mind employs, And the soul glistens in the tearful eye. The fond expecting Maid delighted stands On the bleak summit of yon chalky bourn, With waving handkerchief and lifted hands She hails her darling sailor's safe return. Ill-fated Maid, ne'er shall thy gentle breast The chaste reward of constant passion prove; Ne'er shall that timid form again be press'd In the dear bondage of unsullied love: Stern Heaven forbids—the dark o'erwhelming deep Mocks the poor pilot's skill, and braves his sighs; O'er the high deck the frothy billows sweep, And the fierce tempest drowns the sea-boy's cries. The madd'ning ocean swells with furious roar; See the devoted bark, the shatter'd mast! The splitting hulk, dash'd on the rocky shore, Rolls 'midst the howlings of the direful blast. O'er the vex'd deep the vivid sulphur flies, The jarring elements their clamours blend, The deaf'ning thunder roars along the skies, And whistling winds from lurid clouds descend. The lab'ring wreck, contending with the wave, Mounts to the blast, or plunges in the main; The trembling wretch, suspended o'er his grave, Clings to the tatter'd shrouds; the pouring rain Chills his sad breast:—methinks I see him weep, I hear his fearful groan, his mutter'd pray'r. O cease to mourn! behold the yawning deep, Where soon thy weary soul shall mock Despair! Yes, soon thy aching heart shall rest in peace: For in the arms of Death all human sorrows cease. TO POPE'S OAK. “Enough for me, that to the list'ning swains First in these fields I sung the sylvan strains.” POPE. Written under an Oak in Windsor Forest, bearing the following Inscription. “Here Pope first sung!” O hallow'd tree! Such is the boast thy bark displays; Thy branches, like thy patron's lays, Shall ever, ever, sacred be; Nor with'ring storm, nor woodman's stroke, Shall harm the Poet's favourite Oak. 'Twas here he woo'd his Muse of fire, While Inspiration's wond'rous art, Sublimely stealing thro' his heart, Did Fancy's proudest themes inspire; 'Twas here he wisely learnt to smile At empty praise and courtly guile. Retir'd from flatt'ring, specious arts, From fawning sycophants of state, From knaves with ravag'd wealth elate, And little slaves with tyrant hearts: In conscious freedom nobly proud, He scorn'd the envious grov'ling crowd. Tho' splendid domes around them rise, And pompous titles lull to rest Each struggling virtue in the breast, 'Till Pow'r the place of Worth supplies; The wretched herd can never know The sober joys these haunts bestow. Does the fond Muse delight to dwell, Where freezing penance spreads its shade? Where scarce the sun's warm beams pervade The hoary Hermit's dreary cell? Ah! no—There Superstition blind With torpid langour chills the mind. Or does she seek Life's busy scene, Ah! no, the sordid mean and proud, The little, trifling, flutt'ring crowd, Can never taste her bliss serene; She flies from Fashion's tinsel toys, Nor courts her smile, nor shares her joys. Nor can the dull pedantic mind E'er boast her bright creative fires; Above constraint her wing aspires, Nor rigid spells her flight can bind; The narrow track of musty schools She leaves to plodding vapid fools. To scenes like these she bends her way, Here the best feelings of the soul Nor interest taints, nor threats controul, Nor vice allures, nor snares betray; Here, from each trivial hope remov'd, Our Bard first sought the Muse he lov'd. Still shall thy pensive gloom diffuse The verse sublime, the dulcet song; While round the Poet's seat shall throng Each rapture sacred to the Muse; Still shall thy verdant branches be The bow'r of wond'rous minstrelsy. When glow-worms light their little fires, The am'rous swain and timid maid Shall sit and talk beneath thy shade, As Eve's last rosy tint expires; While on thy boughs the plaintive Dove Shall learn from them the tale of Love. When round the quiv'ring moon-beams play, And Fairies form the grassy ring, 'Till the shrill Lark unfurls his wing, And soars to greet the blushing day, The Nightingale shall pour to thee Her song of love-lorn melody. When thro' the forest dark and drear Full oft, as ancient stories say, Old Herne the Hunter loves to stray, While village-damsels quake with fear; Nor sprite or spectre shall invade The deep repose that marks thy shade. Blest oak! thy mossy trunk shall be As lasting as the Laurel's bloom That decks immortal Virgil's tomb, And fam'd as Shakspere's hallow'd tree; For every grateful Muse shall twine A votive Wreath to deck thy shrine. STANZAS TO THE ROSE. Sweet Picture of Life's chequer'd hour! Ah, wherefore droop thy blushing head? Tell me, oh tell me, hapless flow'r, Is it because thy charms are fled? Come, gentle rose, and learn from me A lesson of Philosophy. Thy scented buds Life's joys disclose, They strew our paths with magic sweets, Where many a thorn like thine, fair Rose, Full oft the weary wand'rer meets: And when he sees thy charms depart, He feels thy thorn within his heart. When Morn's bright torch illum'd the sky, Vainly thy flaunting buds display'd Enamell'd leaves of crimson die,— Ill-fated blossoms doom'd to fade: 'Tis so with Beauty, hapless flow'r, Its lustre blooms but for an hour. Come, blushing rose, and on my breas Recline thy gentle head, and die; Thy scatter'd leaves shall there be press'd, Bath'd with a tear from Pity's eye: There shall thy balmy sweets impart An essence grateful to my heart. Thus Sympathy, with lenient pow'r, Shall bid thy fading charms bestow Soft odours for life's happy hour, Kind healing balsam for its woe! If such thy virtues, rose divine! Oh! may thy envied fate be mine. TO THE MYRTLE. Unfading branch of verdant hue, In modest sweetness drest, Shake off thy pearly tears of dew, And decorate my breast. Dear emblem of the feeling mind, Truth's consecrated tree! Still shall thy trembling blossoms find A faithful friend in me. Nor chilling breeze, nor drizzling rain, Thy glossy leaves can spoil, Their sober beauties fresh remain In every varying soil. If e'er this aching heart of mine A wand'ring thought should prove, O let thy branches round it twine, And bind it fast to Love! For, ah! the little fluttering thing, Amidst Life's tempest rude, Has felt Affliction's sharpest sting, Yet triumphs unsubdued! Like thee it braves the wintry wind And mocks the storm's fierce pow'r; Tho' from its hopes the blast unkind Had torn each promis'd flow'r. Tho' round its fibres barb'rous fate Has twin'd an icy spell, Still in its central fires elate The purest passions dwell. When Life's disast'rous scene is fled, This humble boon I crave: Oh! bind your branches round my head, And blossom on my grave! STANZAS. [Why, if perchance thy gaze I meet] Why, if perchance thy gaze I meet, Glows my wan cheek with crimson dye? Why do my languid pulses beat With quick'ned throbs when thou art nigh? Why does my fault'ring language fail, My trembling form its strength forego; Why do my quiv'ring lips turn pale, Chill'd by the touch of secret woe? Say, when thy tuneful voice I hear, Why does my anguish'd bosom swell? Why steals the fond unbidding tear The soul's dire agony to tell? Why when my feeble hand you press, And whisper passion's transport sweet, Why do I shun the fond caress, And dread thy ardent flame to meet? Ah! 'tis because too well I know Love is a tyrant fickle boy; His smiles conceal the pangs of woe, His dearest gift is short-liv'd joy. He soars aloft on Lovers' sighs; In breaking hearts his temple rears, With cunning care he blinds our eyes, Then, laughing, mocks our falling tears. INSCRIBED TO MARIA, MY BELOVED DAUGHTER. The rose that hails the morning Array'd in all its sweets, Its mossy couch adorning, The sun enamour'd meets; Yet when the warm beam rushes Where, hid in gloom, it lies, O'erwhelm'd with glowing blushes, The hapless victim dies! Sweet Maid, this rose discovers How frail is beauty's doom, When Flatt'ry round it hovers To spoil its proudest bloom. Then shun each gaudy pleasure That lures thee on to fade, And guard thy Beauty's treasure, To decorate a shade! LINES TO HIM WHO WILL UNDERSTAND THEM. Thou art no more my bosom's friend; Here must the sweet delusion end, That charm'd my senses many a year, Thro' smiling summers, winters drear.— O, friendship! am I doom'd to find Thou art a phantom of the mind? A glitt'ring shade, an empty name, An air-born vision's vap'rish flame? And yet, the dear deceit so long Has wak'd to joy my matin song, Has bid my tears forget to flow, Chas'd ev'ry pain, sooth'd ev'ry woe; That Truth, unwelcome to my ear, Swells the deep sigh, recalls the tear, Gives to the sense the keenest smart, Checks the warm pulses of the Heart, Darkens my Fate and steals away Each gleam of joy thro' life's sad day. Britain, Farewell! I quit thy shore, My native Country charms no more; No guide to mark the toilsome road; No destin'd clime; no fix'd abode; Alone and sad, ordain'd to trace The vast expanse of endless space; To view, upon the mountain's height, Thro' varied shades of glimm'ring light The distant landscape fade away In the last gleam of parting day: Or, on the quivering lucid stream, To watch the pale moon's silv'ry beam; Or when, in sad and plaintive strains, The mournful Philomel complains, In dulcet notes bewails her fate, And murmurs for her absent mate; Inspir'd by Sympathy divine, I'll weep her woes—for they are mine. Driven by my Fate, where'er I go O'er burning plains, o'er hills of snow, Or on the bosom of the wave, The howling tempest doom'd to brave, Where'er my lonely course I bend Thy image shall my steps attend; Each object I am doom'd to see Shall bid remembrance turn to Thee. Yes; I shall view thee in each Flow'r, That changes with the transient hour: Thy wand'ring Fancy I shall find Borne on the wings of every wind: Thy wild impetuous passions trace O'er the white wave's tempestuous space: In every changing season prove An emblem of thy wav'ring Love. Torn from my country, friends, and you, The World lies open to my view; New objects shall my mind engage; I will explore th' historic page; Sweet Poetry shall soothe my soul; Philosophy each pang controul: The Muse I'll seek, her lambent fire My soul's quick senses shall inspire; With finer nerves my heart shall beat, Touch'd by Heaven's own Promethean heat; Italia's gales shall bear my song In soft-link'd notes her woods among; Upon the blue hill's misty side, Thro' trackless desarts waste and wide, O'er craggy rocks, whose torrents flow Upon the silver sands below. Sweet Land of Melody! 'tis thine The softest passions to refine; Thy myrtle groves, thy melting strains, Shall harmonize and sooth my pains. Nor will I cast one thought behind On Foes relentless, Friends unkind; I feel, I feel their poison'd dart Pierce the life-nerve within my heart; 'Tis mingled with the vital heat, That bids my throbbing pulses beat; Soon shall that vital heat be o'er, Those throbbing pulses beat no more! No—I will breathe the spicy gale; Plunge the clear stream, new health exhale; O'er my pale cheek diffuse the rose, And drink oblivion to my woes. PASTORAL STANZAS. WRITTEN AT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE. When Aurora's soft blushes o'erspread the blue hill, And the mist dies away at the glances of morn; When the birds join the music that floats on the rill, And the beauties of spring the young woodlands adorn; To breathe the pure air and enliven my soul, I bound from my cottage exulting and gay; No care to molest me, no pow'r to controul, I sport with my lambkins, as thoughtless as they. Yet the bright tear of pity bedews my fond eyes, When I think that for man the dear victims must fall, While Nature such stores of provision supplies, And the bounties of Heaven are common to all. Ah! tell me, Reflection, why custom decreed That the sweet feather'd songsters so slaughter'd should be? For the board of the rich the poor minstrels may bleed, But the fruits of the field are sufficient for me. When I view the proud palace, so pompously gay, Whose high gilded turrets peep over the trees; I pity its greatness and mournfully say, Can mortals delight in such trifles as these! Can a pillow of down sooth the woe-stricken mind, Can the sweets of Arabia calm sickness and pain; Can fetters of gold Love's true votaries bind, Or the gems of Peru Time's light pinions restrain? Can those limbs which bow down beneath sorrow and age, From the floss of the silk-worm fresh vigour receive; Can the pomp of the proud death's grim tyrant assuage, Can it teach you to die, or instruct you to live? Ah no! then sweet peace, lovely offspring of Heav'n, Come dwell in my cottage, thy handmaid I'll be; Thus my youth shall pass on, unmolested and even, And the winter of age be enliven'd by thee! Written on seeing a Rose still blooming at a Cottage Door on Egham Hill, the 25th of October, 1800. Why dost thou linger still, sweet flow'r? Why yet remain, thy leaves to flaunt? This is for thee no fost'ring hour— The cold wind blows, And many a chilling, ruthless show'r Will now assail thee, beauteous rose! Around thee hardy trees may shew Their verdant branches later still; But thy soft blushes, taught to glow For Summer's day, Must, when the wint'ry tempests blow, Like Beauty's cheek, fade fast away. Youth's glowing emblem! wherefore stay And waste thy balmy breath around? This is for thee a killing day— Then wherefore here Waste thy sweet life in sighs away, Bath'd with chill Winter's frozen tear? Thou emblemest the beauteous mind Thrown on Oblivion's gloomy scene: Unheeded, with the wild weeds twin'd, Thou here art plac'd— Thou, whom by Nature's hand design'd, Might'st Beauty's breast have proudly grac'd. Sweet rose! methinks I hear thee say— I might have tasted Beauty's smile; Have bask'd beneath blue-eye's ray, And sank in death! Short would have been my glowing day, And transient pass'd my fleeting breath. I might have bound the golden hair, Whose folds luxuriant wave and glow Round youth's unfurrow'd forehead fair! But one short day Had seen my beauties rich and rare Droop and for ever fade away! Here the poor hovel still displays My ling'ring form, while other flow'rs Long since have seen their sunny days, And shed their sweets; Yet here my bosom morning's rays And morning's tear unvanquish'd meets. Then happier far the lowly Cot Where Nature's modest children reign, Than e'en ambition's loftier lot; For wealth and pow'r, In blank oblivion's gloom forgot, Soon move but the phantoms of a summer hour. LINES WRITTEN BY THE SIDE OF A RIVER. Flow soft River, gently stray, Still a silent waving tide O'er thy glitt'ring carpet glide, While I chaunt my roundelay, As I gather from thy bank, Shelter'd by the poplar dank, King-cups, deck'd in golden pride, Harebells sweet, and “daisies pied;” While beneath the evening sky Soft the western breezes fly. Gentle River, should'st thou be Touch'd with mournful sympathy, When reflection tells my soul Winter's icy breath shall quell Thy sweet bosom's graceful swell, And thy dimpling course controul Should a crystal tear of mine, Fall upon thy lucid breast, Oh receive the trembling guest, For 'tis Pity's drop divine! Gentle Zephyr, softly play, Shake thy dewy wings around, Sprinkle odours o'er the ground, While I chaunt my Roundelay. While the woodbine's mingling shade Veils my pensive, drooping head, Fan, oh fan, the busy gale, That rudely wantons round my cheek, Where the tear of suff'rance meek Glitters on the Lily pale: Ah! no more the damask Rose There in crimson lustre glows; Thirsty fevers from my lip Dare the ruddy drops to sip; Deep within my burning heart Sorrow plants an icy dart, From whose point the soft tears flow, Melting in the vivid glow; Gentle Zephyr, should'st thou be Touch'd with tender sympathy When reflection calls to mind The bleak and desolating wind That soon thy silken wing shall tear, And waft it on the freezing air; Zephyr, should a tender sigh To thy balmy bosom fly, Oh! receive the flutt'ring thing, Place it on thy filmy wing, Bear it to its native sky, For 'tis Pity's softest sigh. O'er the golden lids of day Steals a veil of sober grey; While the flow'rets sink to rest On the moist earth's glitt'ring breast; Homeward now I'll bend my way, And chaunt my plaintive Roundelay. MORNING. O'er fallow plains and fertile meads Aurora lifts the torch of day; The shad'wy brow of Night recedes, Cold dew-drops fall from every spray; Now o'er the thistle's rugged head Thin veils of filmy vapour fly, On ev'ry violet's perfum'd bed The sparkling gems of Nature lie. The hill's tall brow is crown'd with gold, The milk-maid trills her jocund lay, The Shepherd-boy unpens his fold, The Lambs along the meadows play; The pilf'ring Lark, with speckled breast, From the ripe sheaf's rich banquet flies; And lifting high his plumy crest, Soars the proud tenant of the skies. The Peasant steals with timid feet, And gently taps the cottage door; Or on the green sod takes his seat, And chaunts some well-known ditty o'er; Wak'd by the strain, the blushing Maid, Unpractis'd in Love's mazy wiles, In clean, but homely garb array'd, From the small casement peeps—and smiles. Proud Chanticleer unfolds his wing, And flutt'ring struts in plumage gay; The glades with vocal echoes ring, Soft odours deck the hawthorn spray; The School-boy saunters o'er the green, With satchel fill'd with Learning's store; While with dejected, sullen mien, He cons his tedious lesson o'er. When Winter spreads her banner chill, And sweeps the vale with freezing pow'r, And binds in spells the vagrant rill, And shrivels ev'ry ling'ring flow'r; When Nature quits her verdant dress, And drops to earth her icy tears, E'en then thy tardy glance can bless, And soft thy weeping eye appears. Then at the Horn's enliv'ning peal, Keen Sportsmen for the chase prepare; Thro' the young copse shrill echoes steal, Swift flies the tim'rous, panting hare; From ev'ry straw-thatch'd cottage soars Blue curling smoke in many a cloud; Around the barn's expanded doors The feather'd throng impatient crowd. Such are thy charms, health-breathing scene! Where Nature's children revel gay; Where Plenty smiles with radiant mien, And Labour crowns the circling day; Where Peace, in conscious Virtue blest, Invites the Heart to joy supreme; While polish'd Splendour pants for rest, And pine's in Fashion's fev'rish dream. STANZAS TO TIME. Capricious foe to human joy, Still varying with the fleeting day; With thee the purest raptures cloy, The fairest prospects fade away; Nor worth, nor pow'r thy wings can bind, All earthly pleasures fly with thee; Inconstant as the wav'ring wind That plays upon the summer sea. I court thee not, ungentle guest, For I have e'er been doom'd to find Life's gayest hours but idly drest With sweets that pall the sick'ning mind: When smiling Hope, with placid mien, Around my couch did fondly play, Too oft thy aëry form I've seen, On downy pinions glide away. But when perplex'd with pain or care, My couch with thorns was scatter'd round; When the pale priestess of Despair My mind in fatal spells had bound; When the dull hours no joy could bring, No bliss my weary fancy prove, I mark'd thy leaden pond'rous wing, With tardy pace, unkindly move. If such thy gifts, O Time! for thee My sated heart shall ne'er repine; I bow content to Fate's decree, And with thy thorns thy roses twine; Yet ere thy fickle reign shall end, The balmy sweets of Friendship's hour I'll with my cup of sorrow blend, And smile, regardless of thy pow'r. THE REPLY TO TIME. “Cannot my favouring power prolong The lovely lesson of thy song; Cannot I deck thy bust with bays, And lift thee to immortal praise? Then check, sweet Nymph, that angry rhyme, That wounds thy fond adorer—Time.” ORACLE, March 13, 1790. O time! forgive the mournful song That on thy pinions stole along, When the rude hand of pain severe Chas'd down my cheek the burning tear; When sorrow chill'd each warm desire That kindles Fancy's lambent fire; When Hope, by fost'ring Friendship rear'd, A phantom of the brain appear'd; Forgive the song, devoid of art, That stole spontaneous from my heart; For when that heart shall throb no more, And all its keen regrets be o'er, Should kind remembrance shed one tear To sacred Friendship o'er my bier, When the dark precincts of the tomb Shall hide me in its deepest gloom; O! should'st thou on thy wafting wing The sigh of gentle sorrow bring, Or fondly deign to bear the name Of one, alas! unknown to fame, Then shall my weak untutor'd rhyme Exulting boast the gifts of Time. But while I feel youth's vivid fire, Fann'd by the breath of care, expire; While no blest ray of Hope divine O'er my chill'd bosom deigns to shine; While doom'd to mark the vapid day In tasteless languor waste away; Still, still, my sad and plaintive rhyme Must blame the ruthless pow'r of Time. Each infant flow'r of rainbow hue, That bathes its head in morning dew, At twilight droops; the mountain Pine, Whose high and waving brows incline O'er the white cat'racts foamy way, Shall at thy withering touch decay! The craggy cliffs that proudly rise In awful splendour 'midst the skies Shall to the vale in fragments roll, Obedient to thy fell controul! The loftiest fabric rear'd to fame, The sculptur'd Bust, the Poet's name; The softest tint of Titian die, The boast of magic Minstrelsy; The vows to holy Friendship dear, The sainted smile of Love sincere; The flame that warms th' empassion'd heart, All that fine feeling can impart; The wonders of exterior grace, The spells that bind the fairest face, Fade in oblivion's torpid hour The victims of thy tyrant pow'r! TO SIMPLICITY. Sweet blushing Nymph, who loves to dwell In the dark forest's silent gloom; Who smiles within the Hermit's cell, And sighs upon the rustic's tomb; Who, pitying, sees the busy throng, The slaves of fashion's giddy sway; And in a wild and artless song Warbles the feath'ry hours away. Oft have I flown thy steps to trace In the low valley's still retreat, Oft have I view'd thy blooming face In the small cottage, proudly neat: I've seen thee veil'd in vestal lawn, In the cold cloyster's hallow'd shade; I've seen thee at the peep of dawn, In simple russet garb array'd. I've seen thee, crown'd with April flow'rs, Light bounding o'er the rural mead; I've heard thee in sequester'd bow'rs Sing to the Shepherd's past'ral reed; When pleasure led the nymphs along In moonlight gambols o'er the green, I've mark'd thee, fairest of the throng, With modest eye and timid mien. No more my eager gaze shall trace Thy varying footsteps, blithe and free; For what art thou but native grace, Soft Beauty's child, Simplicity! 'Tis thine in every path to dwell Where Truth and Innocence are seen, In cottage low, or Hermit's cell, Or splendid dome, or rural green. The spotless Mind, the brow serene, 'Tis thine, enchanting Maid, to boast! The sweet, benignant, humble mien, And all that Virtue values most! Thy blushes paint Duncannon's cheek, Thy light hand weaves her golden hair, Around her form, thy charms I'll seek, For all the graces revel there! TO ABSENCE. When from the craggy mountain's pathless steep, Whose flinty brow hangs o'er the raging sea, My wand'ring eye beholds the foamy deep, I mark the restless surge—and think of Thee. The curling waves, the passing breezes move, Changing and treach'rous as the breath of Love; The “sad similitude” awakes my smart, And thy dear image twines about my heart. When at the sober hour of sinking day Exhausted Nature steals to soft repose, When the hush'd linnet slumbers on the spray, And scarce a Zephyr fans the drooping Rose; I glance o'er scenes of bliss to friendship dear, And at the fond remembrance drop a tear; Nor can the balmy incense soothe my smart, Still cureless sorrow preys upon my heart. When the loud gambols of the village throng Drown the lorn murmurs of the ring-dove's throat, I think I hear thy fascinating song Join the melodious minstrel's tuneful note; My list'ning ear soon tells me—'tis not thee, Nor thy lov'd song, nor thy soft minstrelsy; In vain I turn away to hide my smart, Thy dulcet numbers vibrate in my heart. When with the Sylvan train I seek the grove, Where May's soft breath diffuses incense round, Where Venus smiles serene, and sportive Love With thornless Roses spreads the fairy ground; The voice of pleasure dies upon mine ear, My conscious bosom sighs—Thou art not here! Soft tears of fond regret reveal its smart, And sorrow, restless sorrow, chills my heart. When at my matin pray'rs I prostrate kneel, And court Religion's aid to soothe my woe, The meek-ey'd saint who pities what I feel Forbids the sigh to heave, the tear to flow; For ah! no vulgar passion fills my mind, Calm Reason's hand illumes the flame refin'd, All the pure feelings Friendship can impart Live in the centre of my aching heart. When at the still and solemn hour of night I press my lonely couch to find repose, Joyless I watch the pale moon's chilling light Where thro' the mould'ring tow'r the north-wind blows; My fev'rish lids no balmy slumbers own, Still my sad bosom beats for thee alone; Nor shall its aching fibres cease to smart 'Till Death's cold spell is twin'd about my heart. TO CESARIO. “If haply, these wild simple flowers To thee some lov'd Image convey; Ah! me, then the neighbouring bowers Yield none half so lovely as they.” CESARIO TO LAURA. ORACLE, Jan. 18, 1790. Cesario, thy lyre's dulcet measure So sweetly, so tenderly flows, That could my sad soul taste of pleasure, Thy music would soften its woes. But ah, gentle soother, where anguish Takes root in the grief-stricken heart; 'Tis the triumph of sorrow to languish, 'Tis rapture to cherish the smart. The mind where pale Mis'ry sits brooding, Repels the soft touch of repose; Shrinks back when blest Reason intruding, The balm of mild comfort bestows. There is luxury oft in declining What pity's kind motives impart, And to bear hapless fate unrepining Is the proudest delight of the heart. Still, still shall thy lyre's gentle measure In strains of pure melody flow, While each heart beats with exquisite pleasure, Save mine—the doom'd victim of woe. STANZAS. [The savage hunter, who afar] The savage hunter, who afar, On some rude mountain's pathless height, Sees in the west the twilight star Just peering on the brow of night, O'er cliffs of ice, or plains of snow, Still bends his long and toilsome way, And, as he tempts the famish'd foe, Anticipates the joys of day. For he, by Hope inspir'd, surveys The moon's wan lustre gild the dome That on some jutting point displays, Oh! blest retreat! his cavern'd home: Where, when the journeying sun shall fade, And cold oblivion's reign return, The torch of Love shall chear the shade, And midst the frozen desart burn. For love can warm the shiv'ring breast, And bid Siberian fierceness sigh; Make flinty caves the couch of rest, And mark with joy the frowning sky. But I, who taste no pleasing dreams To smooth the paths of endless care, Still darkness know 'midst sunny beams, And find in bow'rs of bliss, Despair! WRITTEN ON A FADED BOUQUET. Fair was this blushing rose of May, And fresh it hail'd morn's breezy hour, When ev'ry spangled leaf look'd gay, Besprinkl'd with the twilight show'r; When to its mossy buds, so sweet, The Butterfly enamour'd flew, And hov'ring o'er the fragrant treat, Oft bath'd its silken leaves in dew. Sweet was this primrose of the dale, When on its native turf it grew; And deck'd with charms this lily pale, And rich this violet's purple hue. This od'rous woodbine fill'd the grove With musky gales of balmy pow'r, When, with the myrtle interwove, It hung luxuriant round my bow'r. Ah, rose! forgive the hand severe That snatch'd thee from thy scented bed, Where, bow'd with many a pearly tear, Thy widow'd partner droops its head. And thou, sweet violet, modest flow'r! Oh! take my soft relenting sigh, Nor stain the heart, whose glowing pow'r With too much fondness bade thee die! Sweet lily, had I never gaz'd With rapture on thy gentle form, Thou might'st have died, unknown, unprais'd, The victim of some ruthless storm! Where fickle love his altar rears, Your tiny bells had learn'd to wave; Or, sadly gem'd with kindred tears, Had strown some hapless lover's grave. Inconstant woodbine! wherefore rove, With gadding stem, about my bow'r? Why, with my darling myrtle wove, In bold defiance mock my pow'r? Why quit thy native garden fair, To flaunt thy buds, thy odours fling, And idly greet the passing air, On ev'ry wanton zephyr's wing? Oh! yet repine not, tho' stern Fate Hath nip'd thy leaves of varying hue, Since all that's lovely, soon or late, Shall sicken, fade, and die like you! The fire of youth, the port of age, Nor wisdom's voice, nor beauty's bloom, Th' insatiate tyrant can assuage, Nor check the hand that seal'd your doom! TO THE ASPIN TREE. Why tremble so, broad aspin tree? Why shake thy leaves unceasing? At rest thou never seem'st to be: For when the air is still and clear, Or when the nipping gale increasing Shakes from thy boughs soft twilight's tear, Thou tremblest still, poor aspin tree, And never resting seem'st to be! Beneath thy shade, at sultry noon, I oft have sat deep musing,— And oft I watch'd the rising moon Above the dusky summit shine, A placid light diffusing! When all around, a calm divine, The rest of Nature seem'd to be, Still did'st thou tremble, aspin tree! Hadst thou sensation, I should say Thou wert like me,—unchearly Ordain'd to waste life's hour away, Indignant at the vulgar crowd, And doom'd to feel severely, Scorning the dull, the base, the proud: But thou art senseless, aspin tree! Then wherefore thus—a trembler be? Who shall molest thee, shiv'ring tree? Who shall thy branches sever? The seasons change—and still to thee Another Spring shall give its sweets, And yet thou tremblest ever! Each whisp'ring gale thy bosom meets, As tho' it came to menace thee, Oh! beauteous, trembling aspin tree! Had'st thou a soul, a sensate mind, Well might thy branches quiver; If round thy heart affliction twin'd, To bid each fibre, torture rung, Tremble and ach for ever! Oh! then thy throbbing veins among The stormy passions wild wou'd be, And thou wou'dst tremble, aspin tree. Had'st thou e'er lov'd, or ever felt Warm friendship's ardour glowing; Had'st thou in pity learn'd to melt, Or to another's anguish gave The tear, spontaneous flowing: Then, sighing might thy branches wave, And many a gentle show'r from thee Might fall in tears, sweet aspin tree. Had'st thou e'er known ingratitude, Thou wou'dst have cause to tremble; For in misfortune's tempest rude, The deadliest foe the heart can wound Is he—who can dissemble! He who enthralls the willing mind, And bids the captive bosom be A trembler—like the aspin tree. PITY'S TEAR. What falls so sweet on Summer flow'rs As Nature's blest refreshing show'rs? What bids the bud its sweets exhale, Like ev'ning's mild refreshing gale? Yet sweeter—more delicious far, And brighter than Hesperean star, Decking the intellectual sphere, Is Pity's meek and balmy tear. What bids Despair her sorrows hide? What checks Affliction's torturing tide? What heals the wound of mental pain, And calms the fev'rish throbbing brain? What soothes the rage of jealous pride, And makes the madd'ning pang subside? Lulling to rest distrust and fear, Soft Pity's kind and holy tear! Yet not that pity form'd to give A pang, which bids affliction live; Not pity that can taunting shew Superior pride, untouch'd by woe! Not pity that, with haughty smile, Consoles, and murders all the while! But pity, which is formed to prove The bonds of faith, the test of love! STANZAS FROM THE NATURAL DAUGHTER. Unhappy is the Pilgrim's lot Who wanders o'er the desert heath, By friends and by the world forgot, Whose only hope depends on Death! Yet may he smile when mem'ry shews The tort'ring stings, the weary woes Which forc'd his bosom to abide The vulgar scorn of vulgar pride. Forlorn is he who on the sand Of some bleak isle his hovel rears, Or shipwreck'd on the breezy strand, The billows' deep'ning murmur hears. Yet, when his aching eyes survey The white sails gliding far away, He feels he shall no more abide The vulgar scorn of vulgar pride. Sadly the exiled Trav'ller strays, Benighted in some forest drear, Where, by the paly star-light rays, He sees no hut, no hovel, near. The fire-ey'd wolf, which howls for prey, Glares hideous in his briery way, Yet he can smile—for he has borne The sneers of pride and vulgar scorn. Of all the ills the feeling mind Is destin'd in this world to share; Of pain and poverty combin'd, Of Friendship's frown, or Love's despair; Still reason arms the conscious soul, And bids it ev'ry pang controul, Save when the patient heart is tried By vulgar scorn and vulgar pride. Go, Wealth, and in the Hermit's cell Behold that peace thou canst not have; Go, Rank, and list the passing knell That warns thee to oblivion's grave. Go, Pow'r, and when the peasant's breast Enjoys the balm of conscious rest, Confess that Virtue can deride The vulgar scorn of vulgar pride. THE SORROWS OF MEMORY. In vain to me the howling deep Stern Winter's awful reign discloses; In vain shall Summer's zephyrs sleep On fragrant beds of budding roses; To me, alike each scene appears, Since thou hast broke my heart, or nearly; While Mem'ry writes in frequent tears That I have lov'd thee very dearly! How many summers pass'd away, How many winters sad and dreary, And still I taught thee to be gay Whene'er of life thy soul was weary; When ling'ring sickness wrung thy breast, And bow'd thee to the earth, or nearly, I strove to lull thy mind to rest— For then I lov'd thee, Oh! how dearly! And tho' the flush of joy no more Shall, o'er my cheek its lustre throwing, Bid giddy fools that cheek adore, And talk of passion—ever glowing; Still to my mind should time impart A charm to bid it feel sincerely, Nor idly wound a breaking heart, That lov'd long and lov'd thee dearly. Could gold thy truant nature bind, A faithful heart would still content me, For oh! to keep that heart unkind, I gave thee all that Fortune lent me! In youth, when suitors round me press'd, Who vow'd to love, and love sincerely; When wealth could never charm my breast, Tho' thou wert poor I lov'd thee dearly. Seek not the fragile dreams of love, Such fleeting phantoms will deceive thee; They will but transient idols prove— In wealth beguile, in sorrow leave thee. Ah! dost thou hope the sordid mind When thou art poor will feel sincerely? Wilt thou in such that friendship find Which warm'd the heart that lov'd thee dearly? Tho' fickle passions cease to burn For her so long thy bosom's treasure, Ah! think that reason may return When far from thee my steps I measure; Say who will then thy conscience heal, Or who shall bid thy heart beat cheerly? Or from that heart the mem'ry steal Of her who lov'd thee long and dearly? When war shall rouze the brooding storm, And horrors haunt thy thorny pillow; When fancy shall present my form Borne on the wild and restless billow; Or where wilt thou an helpmate find Whose pulse, like mine, shall throb sincerely? Or who thy heart in spells shall bind When hers is broke that lov'd thee dearly? I will not court thy fickle love Soon shall our fates and fortunes sever; Far from thy scorn will I remove, And smiling, sigh adieu for ever! Give to the sordid fiend thy days, Still trust that they will act sincerely, And when the specious mask decays, Lament the heart that lov'd thee dearly! For Time will swiftly journey on, And Age and Sickness haste to meet thee; Friends prov'd deceitful—will be gone When they no more with smiles can cheat thee. Then wilt thou seek in vain to find A faithful heart that beats sincerely; A passion cent'ring in a mind Which, scorning int'rest, lov'd thee dearly. When in the grave this heart shall sleep, No soothing dream will bless thy slumber, For thou perchance may'st wake to weep, And with remorse my sorrows number! My shade will haunt thy aching eyes, My voice in whispers tell thee clearly How cold at last that bosom lies Which lov'd thee long, and lov'd thee dearly! TO THE MOLE. Thou creep'st in darkness, busy thing! The progress of the brightest day To thee can nothing chearful bring, No soul-expanding ray! For, ever lab'ring, ever dreary, Thou never feel'st of sweet delight That one, the proudest sense, which cheary Scatters the sullen mist of night! Thou can'st not see thy mazy way, Slow yielding to thy gloomy toils; Thou find'st no brightly smiling ray Give pleasure as it smiles! Thou know'st not, when thy task pursuing, Where that dull task will end; Or when, to work thy own undoing, Thou bid'st the fairy hill ascend. And yet, poor, blind, incautious mole, What am I, more refined than thee? Tis true I own a sensate soul, And all around I see! But do I 'scape the snare that, waiting, Crosses my dreary way? Or, for myself an home creating, Smooth busy life's precarious way? Do I not toil! and toil like thee, Unknowing where that toil will end? Do I not blindly seek to be Of foes, unseen, the friend? Can human wisdom shun the ruin Which lurks my life to snare? And still, the passions wild subduing, Defy the bidden shaft of care? Do I presume to scan the pow'r, Which bids me, ever reasoning, try To buffet with the stormy hour, 'Till Fate shall bid me die? Do I, my future being knowing, Trace what I then shall be; Or, while this fervid heart is glowing, Its long and freezing hour foresee? TO THE WILD BROOK. Unheeded emblem of the mind! When weeping twilight's shadows close, I wander where thy mazes wind, And watch thy current as it flows: Now dimpling, silent, calm, and even; Now brawling, as in anger driv'n; Now ruffled, foaming, madly wild, Like the vex'd sense of Sorrow's hopeless child! Beside thy surface now I see, Reflected in thy placid breast, Flush'd summer's painted progeny, In smiles and sweets redundant drest: They flaunt their forms of varying dye, To greet thee as thou passest by; And, bending, sip thy ample wave, And in its lucid lapse their blushing bosoms lave. While on thy tranquil breast appears No freezing gale, no passing storm, The sunbeam's vivid lustre chears, And seems thy silv'ry bed to warm; The thronging birds, with am'rous play, Sweep with their wings thy glitt'ring way; And o'er thy banks fond zephyr blows, To dress with sweets the smallest flow'r that grows. But when destroying blasts arise, And clouds o'ershade thy with'ring bounds; When swift the eddying foliage flies, And loud the ruthless torrent sounds: Thy dripling charms are seen no more, Thy minstrel's caroll'd praise is o'er; While not a flowret, sunny-drest, Courts the chill'd current of thy alter'd breast. Such is the human mind:—serene When Fortune's glowing hour appears; And lovely as thy margin green Are buds of Hope, which Fancy rears: Then Adulation, like the flow'r, Bends as it greets us on our way; But, in the dark and stormy hour, Leaves us, unmark'd, to trace our troubled way. STANZAS. [Hark! 'tis the merry bells that ring] Hark! 'tis the merry bells that ring On yonder upland sunny green; Their sounds to mournful mem'ry bring The blissful days and hours I've seen: Their swelling changes die away, So did my heart's best love decay! Hark! 'tis the Beetle flitting round, O'er yonder hawthorn fresh and sweet; Once could I mock the drowsy sound, With Henry on the greensward seat: But now I weep to hear its tone, For, O! my heart's true love is flown! Hark! 'tis the Raven's dismal croak, My boding breast is chill'd with fear! Yet once beneath yon spreading oak The bird of woe I smil'd to hear: For Love and Fancy chear'd the gloom, Where now the turf marks Henry's tomb! Come, pale-cheek'd Vestal of the night, And spangle the long grass with dew; Deck the tall woods with silv'ry light, And buds of fragrant flow'rets strew; While Love in secret sorrow hies To guard the grave—where Henry lies! There will I lay me down forlorn, And close my weeping eyes, and die! And when the smiling blushing morn Shall rush along the eastern sky, There shall the thronging village see, To part no more, my love and me! STANZAS FROM THE NATURAL DAUGHTER. 'Tis night! and o'er the barren plain The weary wand'rer bends his way; While on his path the silv'ry ray Soothes him with hope that he shall see The moony shadows quickly flee, And morn return again. The blast blows nipping on his breast, Swift flies the wild and foamy stream; Yet Hope presents a feeble gleam, That ere day rises he shall close His weary lids in soft repose Upon a bed of rest. The moon is dim, by clouds o'ercast, Loud roars the torrent down the vale; The wand'rer's cheek is cold and pale, He hears the owl with boding cry Across the dreary desart fly, He starts, and stops aghast! And now in haste, with dumb despair, O'er bush and brier he bends his way; No cottage taper's length'ning ray Gleams faint across the barren heath, He trembles, sighs, and thinks of death, And breathes a timid pray'r. And now the dawn is rising fast, Soft flies the fresh and chearing gale; The red'ning clouds on light wings sail, The dew begems the fragrant heath: No more he starts or thinks of death, Or sighs for sorrows past. So, through life's journey we descry Man gay or sad; he weeps or smiles As cares annoy, or hope beguiles: Then blest are those who wisely say, “We will enjoy the present day,— To-morrow we may die!” STANZAS ON MAY 1799. Sweet May! once the parent of love, we behold Sighing sad for her verdant array; While the glow of her bosom is check'd by the cold, And her tears tremble still on the spray. Say, Nature! O why is this change so severe? Why does Spring wear so chilling a frown? Why does noon still present unabsorb'd morning's tear, Why does May still expect its green gown? Is love grown so cold, does the bosom no more Glow with ardour to greet thee, sweet May? Is the smile and the frolic of youth ever o'er, And extinct the bright torch of thy day? Alas! all is chang'd; the fine feelings subside, 'Tis the triumph of Apathy cold! Affection is driv'n from the bosom of pride, And the fiend that expels her—is Gold! Sour Interest keeps her aloof, while no more Soft Philanthropy smiles on Despair; Tho' Profusion and Folly wide scatter their store, For the dull and the vicious to share. All Nature is alter'd; her energies now Shall no more in our vallies prevail; No swain on our mountains repeats his soft vow, And no damsel breathes love with the gale. War teaches the bosom of Nature to sigh, While she gazes with anguish around, While the tear of Religion falls fast from her eye, And each morn blushes deep on her wound. O May! let thy smiles and thy graces return, Let thy breath Nature's treasures inclose; Let her tears on thy flow'rets embellish the urn Where the ashes of valour repose. Let the revels of Pride and of Folly be o'er, Give to Merit the prodigal feast; And let Pity the haunts of the wretched explore, Till the portion of pain be decreas'd. And let Wealth to the mansions of Sorrow repair, With its weeds the sweet olive entwine; With the sigh of Regret fan the breast of Despair, And the wreath of false splendour resign. STANZAS. [As o'er the world, by sorrow prest] As o'er the world, by sorrow prest, I wander sad and weary, In hopes to find a place of rest From scenes forlorn and dreary; Where'er I go, I'm doom'd to trace, If fortune smiles, the smiling face; But if she frowns, I'm sure to see All frown on me! When morning blushes through her tears, And Nature flaunts her treasures, How gaudy ev'ry path appears! How rich in boundless pleasures! But if the dawn, in misty gloom, Still veils the flow'ret's vivid bloom, Now droops in shade the loftiest tree That shelter'd me! Nor truth nor feeling can insure The friend that's ever smiling; Worth cannot worldly mis'ry cure, Its darkest hours beguiling. This heart, which owns the purest flame, Must patient bend, nor dare to blame, Since fortune's frown the fates decree To follow me! Thus all things light or dark appear, As fortune cheers or saddens; For time flies slow when grief is near, But swift when transport gladdens. Youth is a transient summer dream, Where visions gay and flitting seem; But Time and Reason wake to see Them fade like me! O! come, capricious Fortune blind, Subdue this bosom's feeling; Make dim the fire that warms my mind, Thence all its fervour stealing. Teach me the sordid servile art To dress in low disguise the heart, Then ev'ry face shall gentle be, And smile on me! STANZAS Supposed to be written near a Tree, over the Grave of AN OFFICER, Who was killed at Lincelles, in Flanders, in August 1793. Ah! pensive trav'ller, if thy tear E'er fell on valour's early grave, Arrest thy wand'ring steps, and here Lament the lot that waits the brave! Here let the moralist descry The proudest tomb that man can claim, The glorious bed where heroes lie Who perish'd for their country's fame. Here bind the laurel, steep'd in tears, Tears that in glowing youth he died, Blest with each charm that most endears, His kindred's hope, his nation's pride! Oh! hallow'd turf! some silent spot, Adorn'd with sorrow's gem sublime, E'en when the Muse shall be forgot, Thy fame shall brave the blasts of time! And thou, rude bark, preserve his name, Carv'd by some just recording hand; And, proudly conscious of that fame, Thy guardian branches wide expand. Keep from this sod the pattering rain, The wintry wind, the drifted snow; And when blithe Summer paints the plain, Here let the sweetest flow'rets blow. No trophied column trimm'd with bays, No gilded tablet bears his name; A soldier boasts superior praise, A grateful country guards his fame. LINES TO MARIA, MY BELOVED DAUGHTER. Written on her Birth-Day, Oct. 18, 1793. To paint the lust'rous streaks of morn, Along the pale horizon borne, When from Aurora's opening eye Effulgent glory gilds the sky; Or yet a softer theme to sing Of purple evening's humid wing; To trace the crystal car of night Along the plains of starry light, Where the chaste Goddess bends her way, Diffusing round a trembling ray;— No more shall charm my pensive Muse, With transient forms, or varying hues: This hour my tenderer task shall be, Sweet darling Maid, to sing of thee! Attend my strain, and while I blend The Guardian, Parent, Poet, Friend, Believe, as each my verse shall prove, A picture fraught with truth and love, And every candid line impart The feelings of a Mother's heart! Oh! form'd to soothe the wounds of Fate, Dear solace of my mournful state! Thou, only blessing Heav'n bestows To shed meek Patience on my woes! Know—that in life's disast'rous scene, Whate'er my chequer'd lot has been, No hour was yet so dear to me As that blest hour which gave me thee! From infant sweetness still I've trac'd Thy mind, with ev'ry virtue grac'd; Still have I mark'd Time's ceaseless wing Some new endearing treasure bring; While Hope, soft-whisp'ring, bid me gaze On bright'ning scenes of distant days, When, more matur'd, these doating eyes Should see the lovelier woman rise, Adorn'd with all the modest grace That beam'd about thy infant face; Yet with a mind more passing fair Than all that Nature pictur'd there! With such a mind, so richly stor'd, Still may'st thou live, admir'd, ador'd! Through life enjoy the bliss divine That waits on innocence like thine! Still greet the morn with conscious smile, With tranquil scenes the hours beguile; And, when the busy day shall close, Still find a couch of sweet repose! For me, so long ordain'd to trace O'er life's dark wild a thorny space— Still ev'ry sorrow doom'd to share, Still shall my heart those sorrows bear, Nor will I mourn at Fate's decree, If Heav'n, in pity, spares me thee! THE PILGRIM's FAREWELL. FROM THE ROMANCE OF VANCENZA. O'er desarts untrodden, o'er moss-cover'd hills, I have wander'd forlorn and alone; My tears I have mingled with slow-winding rills, And the valleys have echo'd my groan! I have seen the wan Moon from her silver veil peep, As she rose from her cloud-dappled bed; I have heard the dread hurricane yell 'midst the deep, As the lightnings play'd over my head! When the tempest subsided I saw the faint dawn O'er the eastern hill meekly appear; While each King-cup that droop'd on the dew-shining lawn From its golden lids dropp'd a soft tear. I have seen the bright day-star illumine the earth, I have hail'd the proud sov'reign of fire; I have smil'd on the primrose just waken'd to birth, I have sigh'd—to behold it expire! How oft have I pitied the plaint of the dove, How I've mus'd near the nightingale's nest! For, alas! when the mourner sings sweetly of Love, 'Tis soft sympathy thrills through my breast. I have seen the tall forest o'ershadow the glade, And extend its broad branches on high; But how soon have I mark'd its rich canopy fade, And its yellow leaves whirl'd to the sky! I have sigh'd o'er the sod where some Lover was laid; I have torn the rude weeds from his breast; I have deck'd it with flow'rets; and oft I have said, “How I envy thy pallet of rest!” I have trac'd the long shades o'er the wave's silky green, When the storm gather'd over the main; I have gaz'd with delight on the landscape serene When the evening-bell toll'd on the plain. Exulting and gay, I have smil'd to behold Proud Nature luxuriantly drest; I have wept when I saw her uncover'd and cold, And the winter-blast howl'd o'er her breast. Since such are the scenes of this journey of Care, Since each pleasure is mingled with pain, Still let me the raptures of Sympathy share, And my bosom shall scorn to complain. Though destin'd to wander o'er mountains of snow, Vancenza! O mansion divine! Thy Pilgrim shall smile at his journey of woe, And his heart, his warm heart shall be thine! STANZAS Written on the 14th of February, TO MY ONCE DEAR VALENTINE. Come, Hope, and sweep the trembling string; Drop from thy pinions balm divine; While, drooping o'er my lyre, I sing The graces of my Valentine. Ah! Graces, fatal to my peace, Why round my heart your mischiefs twine? Say, barb'rous Love, can aught increase The triumphs of my Valentine? No more about my auburn hair The sparkling gems shall proudly vie; The cypress, emblem of Despair, Shall there a faded chaplet die. Young dimpled Pleasure quits my breast To seek some gaudier bow'r than mine, Where low Caprice, by Fancy drest, Enthrals my truant Valentine. The frozen brook, the mountain snow, The pearls that on the thistle shine, The northern winds, that chilly blow, Are emblems of my Valentine. Pale Sorrow sheds the quiv'ring flame That gleams on Truth's neglected shrine, Fann'd by those sighs which still proclaim How much I love thee, Valentine! Whene'er the icy hand of Death Shall grasp this sensate frame of mine, On my cold lip the fleeting breath Shall murmur still—“dear Valentine!” Then o'er my grave, ah! drop one tear, And sighing write this pensive line— “A faithful heart lies mould'ring here, That well deserv'd its Valentine!” STANZAS INSCRIBED TO A ONCE DEAR FRIEND, WHEN CONFINED BY SEVERE INDISPOSITION, IN MARCH 1793. Ye glades that just open to greet the blue sky, All encircled with woodlands bespangled with dew, From your borders, once cherish'd, disgusted I fly; For your beauties are faded, and sadden'd your hue. O! soft gliding river, whose banks I behold Undelighted and mournful, no longer you please; Nor the deep azure bells, nor the cowslips of gold, Nor your smooth glassy bosom o'ershadow'd with trees. Yon mountain, whose breezes enliven the soul, Never more will I climb at the dawning of day; Never more to the turf-cover'd meadows I'll stroll, Or on beds of young primroses carol my lay. For, glades, to your sod with my love I've retir'd When the red beams were rushing the foliage among, When the last glowing shadow of Evening expir'd, And the rocks rung responsive to Philomel's song. And thou, lucid river, I've sat by thy side, To behold his dear form in thy clear glassy breast, When the Moon spread her light o'er thy soft rolling tide, And the wise were content with the dulness of rest. And thou, craggy mountain, where oft I have stray'd, To behold from your summit the thatch of his cot; Like the slow-winding river, the dew-spangled glade, And the thick-woven woodlands—be ever forgot. See! Nature is sadden'd by Sympathy's tears, Since my Lover no longer enlivens the day; And forlorn shall she be till her darling appears, As the Rose droops its head when the Sun fades away. TO THE SAME, ON HIS RECOVERING FROM A LONG INDISPOSITION, IN MAY, 1793. Go, balmy gales, and tell Lisardo's ear, That Health comes smiling on the wings of Morn; Tell him, that sweet Repose approaches near, To banish fev'rish Days, and Nights forlorn. Brightly the Sun-beams on the mountains break, And whisp'ring Zephyrs shake their wings around; The Day-star steals away in lustre meek, And spreading glories gild the dewy ground. Exulting Flora opes her varying hues; The Valley smiles, the verdant Hills look gay; From her abundant store Profusion strews The buds and tints of rosy-bosom'd May. The lofty woodlands wave their leafy heads, To wake the plumy trav'llers of the air; The low-born lilies, on their humid beds, Expand their spotless bosoms, fresh and fair. Slow winds the brawling river through the vales; Down the rough rock the roaring torrents flee, The high-pois'd lark on floods of ether sails, To greet the Lord of Light with songs of glee. Soft is the perfume of Morn's beauteous breast, And soft the murmurs of the insect train; While Nature's hand, with pearly lustre drest, Leads tip-toe Pleasure o'er the glitt'ring plain. For thee, Lisardo, she unfolds her store, For thee she weaves a garland, proudly gay; Come then, my Friend, the lib'ral Nymph adore, And own that Rapture is the child of May. And while returning Health pervades each nerve, As April Suns disperse the wintry gloom, The sad rememb'rance of past “woe shall serve For sweet discourses in our time to come.” THE ADIEU TO FANCY. INSCRIBED TO THE SAME. When first I knew thee, Fancy's aid A mine of peerless worth display'd, A thousand graces hourly stole In melting visions o'er my soul. For Fancy guides the shaft of Love, And bids fantastic visions move In mystic mazes round the breast, In Hope's delusive colours dress'd. 'Tis Fancy wings the Poet's thought, With classic Taste sublimely fraught; And bids the fount of Reason flow, With smooth delight, or ruffled woe. Full oft the gentle Sylph I've seen, With soothing smile and sportive mien, When, wand'ring to her fairy bow'rs, She bound my grateful breast with flow'rs. And oft with flatt'ring Hope she came To twine a wreath of promis'd Fame; Yet 'midst the laurel'd gift I found Full many a thorn my breast to wound. Oh! then she brought, my mind to calm, Persuasive Friendship's soothing balm; And Sympathy, with throbbing breast, In Pity's specious semblance drest. Yet Friendship's beauteous form I found Would start aghast at Sorrow's wound; And Sympathy's slow trickling tear Would cease to flow when Grief was near. Then let me own the tranquil scene, The constant thought, the smile serene, And know myself supremely blest! Deceitful Fancy—take the rest! THE MORALIST. Hark! the hollow moaning wind Sweeps along the midnight air, Sullen as the guilty mind; Hidden source of dark despair. See the death-wing'd Lightning fly! Desolation marks its way, Fatal as the vengeful Eye, Fixing on its destin'd prey. Dreadful Thunders threat'ning roll, Viewless, 'midst the turbid clouds! So the fierce relentless soul Hate's empoison'd arrow shrouds. See the billowy Ocean's breast, Sway'd by ev'ry wav'ring wind, Rises, foams, and sinks to rest, Fickle as the human mind! Sweetly blooms the Rose of May, Glitt'ring with the tears of Morn; So insidious Smiles betray, While they hide the treach'rous Thorn. Mark gay Summer's glowing prime, Shadow'd by the twilight gloom; So the ruthless wing of Time Bends the fairest to the Tomb. Moralist! where'er you move O'er vast Nature's varying plan, Ev'ry changing scene shall prove A sad epitome of man! STANZAS TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER, ON SEEING HER GATHER SOME PENSEES. Forbear, rash Maid! thy hand restrain; Nor with yon gentle victim stain A breast so fair, so true! Ah! think, the little harmless flow'r Lives but a transient sunny hour, Ere doom'd to fade like you. Though silken cords around it twin'd, One sad, short day, its stems may bind; Vain is the harsh decree! Its magic form no spell can hold; Still shall it triumph uncontroul'd, For Thoughts are ever free. And if those Buds, so sweet, so fair, Can 'scape the bold intruder's snare, Their triumph should be thine; For, like thy pure and tender heart, They scorn the feeble aid of Art, And glow with charms divine. Then let soft Sympathy prevail; No more the gentle leaves assail! Ah! let them bloom their hour! Take not what bounteous Nature gave, But learn to cherish, and to save, Then triumph in thy Pow'r! STANZAS WRITTEN AFTER SUCCESSIVE NIGHTS OF MELANCHOLY DREAMS. Ye airy Phantoms, by whose pow'r Night's curtains spread a deeper shade; Who, prowling in the murky hour, The weary sense with spells invade; Why round the fibres of my brain Such desolating miseries fling, And with new scenes of mental pain Chase from my languid eye sleep's balm-dispensing wing? Ah! why, when o'er the darken'd globe All Nature's children sink to rest— Why, wrapp'd in Horror's ghastly robe, With shad'wy hand assail my breast? Why conjure up a tribe forlorn, To menace, where I bend my way? Why round my pillow plant the thorn, Or fix the Demons dire in terrible array? Why, when the busy day is o'er— A day, perhaps of tender thought— Why bid my eager gaze explore New prospects, with new anguish fraught? Why bid my madd'ning sense descry The Form in silence I adore? His magic smile, his murd'rous eye! Then bid me wake to prove the fond illusion o'er! When, fev'rish with the throbs of pain, And bath'd with many a trickling tear, I close my cheated eyes again, Despair's wild bands are hov'ring near: Now borne upon the yelling blast, O'er craggy Peaks I bend my flight; Now on the yawning Ocean cast, I plunge unfathom'd depths, amid the shades of night! Or, borne upon the billows' Ire, O'er the vast waste of waters drear, Where shipwreck'd Mariners expire, No friend their dying plaints to hear, I view far off the craggy cliff, Whose white top mingles with the skies; While at its base the shatter'd Skiff, Wash'd by the foaming wave, in many a fragment lies. Oft, when the Morning's gaudy beams My lattice gild with sparkling light, O'erwhelm'd with agonizing dreams, And bound in spells of fancied Night, I start, convulsive, wild, distraught! By some pale Murd'rer's poniard press'd, Or by the grinning Phantom caught, Wake from the madd'ning grasp with horror-freezing breast! Then down my cold and pallid cheek The mingling tears of joy and grief The soul's tumultuous feeling speak, And yield the struggling heart relief; I smile to know the danger past, But soon the radiant moment flies— Soon is the transient Day o'ercast, And hope steals trembling from my languid eyes! If thus, for moments of repose, Whole hours of mis'ry I must know; If, when each sunny day shall close, I must each gleam of peace forego! If for one little morn of mirth, This breast must feel long nights of pain, Oh! Life, thy joys are nothing worth! Then let me sink to rest—and never wake again! THE MANIAC. Ah! what art thou, whose eye-balls roll Like Heralds of the wand'ring soul, While down thy cheek the scalding torrents flow? Why does that agonizing shriek The mind's unpitied anguish speak? O tell me, thing forlorn! and let me share thy woe. Why dost thou rend thy matted hair, And beat thy burning bosom bare? Why is thy lip so parch'd, thy groan so deep? Why dost thou fly from cheerful light, And seek in caverns mid-day night, And cherish thoughts untold, and banish gentle sleep? Why dost thou from thy scanty bed Tear the rude straw to crown thy head, And nod with ghastly smile, and wildly sing? While down thy pale distorted face The crystal drops each other chase, As though thy brain were drown'd in one eternal spring? Why dost thou climb yon craggy steep, That frowns upon the clam'rous deep, And howl, responsive to the waves below? Or on the margin of the rock Thy Sov'reign Orb exulting mock, And waste the freezing night in pacing to and fro? Why dost thou strip the fairest bow'rs, To dress thy scowling brow with flow'rs, And fling thy tatter'd garment to the wind? Why madly dart from cave to cave, Now laugh and sing, then weep and rave, And round thy naked limbs fantastic fragments bind? Why dost thou drink the midnight dew, Slow trickling from the baneful yew, Stretch'd on a pallet of sepulchral stone; While, in her solitary tow'r, The Minstrel of the witching hour Sits half congeal'd with fear, to hear thy dismal moan? Thy form upon the cold earth cast, Now grown familiar with the blast, Defies the biting frost and scorching sun: All Seasons are alike to thee; Thy sense, unchain'd by Destiny, Resists, with dauntless pride, all miseries but one! Fix not thy steadfast gaze on me, Shrunk atom of mortality! Nor freeze my blood with thy distracted groan; Ah! quickly turn those eyes away, They fill my soul with dire dismay, For dead and dark they seem, and almost chill'd to stone! Yet, if thy scatter'd senses stray Where Reason scorns to lend a ray, Or if Despair supreme usurps her throne, Oh! let me all thy sorrows know; With thine my mingling tear shall flow, And I will share thy pangs, and make thy griefs my own. Hath Love unlock'd thy feeling breast, And stol'n from thence the balm of rest? Then far away on purple pinions borne, Left only keen regret behind, To tear with poison'd fangs thy mind, While barb'rous Mem'ry lives, and bids thee hopeless mourn? Does Fancy to thy straining arms Give the false Nymph in all her charms, And with her airy voice beguile thee so, That Sorrow seems to pass away, Till the blithe harbinger of day Awakes thee from thy dream, and yields thee back to woe? Say, have the bonds of Friendship fail'd, Or jealous pangs thy mind assail'd; While black Ingratitude, with ranc'rous tooth, Pierc'd the fine fibres of thy heart, And fest'ring every sensate part, Dim'd with contagious breath the crimson glow of youth? Or has stern Fate, with ruthless hand, Dash'd on some wild untrodden strand Thy little bark, with all thy fortunes fraught; While thou didst watch the stormy night Upon some bleak rock's fearful height, Till thy hot brain consum'd with desolating thought? Ah! wretch forlorn, perchance thy breast, By the cold fangs of Avarice press'd, Grew hard and torpid by her touch profane; Till Famine pinch'd thee to the bone, And mental torture made thee own That thing the most accurs'd, who drags her endless chain! Or say, does flush'd Ambition's wing Around thy fev'rish temples fling Dire incense, smoking from th' ensanguin'd plain, That, drain'd from bleeding warriors' hearts, Swift to thy shatter'd sense imparts The victor's savage joy, that thrills through ev'ry vein? Does not the murky gloom of night Give to thy view some murd'rous sprite, Whose poniard gleams along thy cell forlorn; And when the Sun expands his ray, Dost thou not shun the jocund day, And mutter curses deep, and hate the ruddy Morn? And yet the Morn on rosy wing Could once to thee its raptures bring, And Mirth's enliv'ning song delight thine ear; While Hope thine eye-lids could unclose From the sweet slumbers of repose, To tell thee Love's gay throng of tender joys were near! Or hast thou stung with poignant smart The orphan's and the widow's heart, And plung'd them in cold Poverty's abyss; While Conscience, like a vulture, stole To feed upon thy tortur'd soul, And tear each barb'rous sense from transitory bliss? Or hast thou seen some gentle maid, By thy deluding voice betray'd, Fade like a flow'r, slow with'ring with remorse? And didst thou then refuse to save Thy victim from an early grave, Till at thy feet she lay a pale and ghastly corse? Oh! tell me, tell me all thy pain; Pour to mine ear thy frenzied strain, And I will share thy pangs, and soothe thy woes! Poor Maniac! I will dry thy tears, And bathe thy wounds, and calm thy fears, And with soft Pity's balm enchant thee to repose. MARIE ANTOINETTE'S LAMENTATION, IN HER PRISON OF THE TEMPLE. Written in March 1793. When on my bosom Evening's ruby light Thro' my thrice-grated window warmly glows, Why does the cheerful ray offend my sight, And with its lustre mock my weary woes? Alas! because on my sad breast appears A dreadful record—written with my tears! When awful Midnight, with her ebon wand, Charms Nature's poorest meanest child to peace, Why cannot I one little hour command, When gentle sleep may bid my anguish cease? Alas! because, where'er I lay my head, A dreary couch I find, with many a thorn o'erspread. When the sun, rising in the eastern skies, Awakes the feather'd race to songs divine, Why does remembrance picture to these eyes The jocund morn of life, that once was mine? Alas! because, in sorrow doom'd to mourn, I ne'er shall see that blissful morn return! When I behold my darling infants sleep, Fair spotless blossoms, deck'd in op'ning charms, Why do I start aghast, and wildly weep, And madly snatch them to my eager arms? Ah me! because my sense, o'erwhelm'd with dread, Views the sweet cherubs on their funeral bed! Why, when they ope their eyes to gaze on me, And fondly press me in their dear embrace, Hang on my neck, or clasp my trembling knee, Why do maternal sorrows drench my face? Alas! because inhuman hands unite To tear from my fond soul its last delight! Oh, fell Barbarity! yet spare a while The sacred treasures of my throbbing breast; Oh, spare their infant hearts, untouch'd by guile, And let a widow'd mother's darlings rest! Though you have struck your faulchions at the root, Oh, give the tender branches time to shoot! The lightning, by the angry tempest cast, Strikes at the lofty pine, and lays it low; While the small flow'ret 'scapes the deadly blast, A while its od'rous breath around to throw! Then let distracted Gallia's lilies bloom, Tho' but to deck with sweets a dungeon's gloom! O my poor innocents! all bath'd in tears, Like with'ring flow'rets wash'd with chilling dew, Sleep on, nor heed a frantic mother's fears: The savage tigers will not injure you! Your harmless bosoms not a crime can know, Scarce born to greatness—ere consign'd to woe! When left forlorn, dejected, and alone, Imperfect sounds my pensive soul annoy; I hear in every distant mingling tone The merry bells—the boist'rous songs of joy! Ah! then I contemplate my loathsome cell, Where meagre grief and scowling horror dwell! The rabble's din, the tocsin's fateful sound; The cannon thund'ring thro' the vaulted sky, The curling smoke, in columns rising round, Which from my iron lattice I descry, Rouse my lethargic mind! I shriek in vain, My tyrant jailor only mocks my pain! Yet bear thy woes, my soul, with proud disdain, Meet the keen lance of Death with stedfast eye; Think on the glorious tide that fills each vein, And throbbing bids me tremble not, to die! Yet, shall I from my friendless children part? Oh, all the mother rushes to my heart! Where'er I turn, a thousand ills appear, Arm'd at all points, in terrible array: Pale hood-wink'd murder ever lurking near, And coward cruelty that shuns the day! See, see, they pierce, with many a recreant sword, The mangled bosom of my bleeding Lord! Oh, dreadful thought! Oh, agony supreme! When will the sanguinary scene be o'er? When will my soul, in sweet Oblivion's dream, Fade from this orb to some more peaceful shore? When will the cherub Pity break the snare, And snatch one victim from the last despair? A FRAGMENT. Supposed to be written near the Temple, at Paris, on the Night before the Execution of Louis XVI. Now Midnight spreads her sable vest With starry rays, light-tissu'd o'er; Now from the desart's thistled breast The chilling dews begin to soar; The owl shrieks from the tott'ring tow'r, Dread watch-bird of the witching hour! Spectres, from their charnel cells, Cleave the air with hideous yells! Not a glow-worm ventures forth To gild his little speck of earth! In wild despair Creation seems to wait, While Horror stalks abroad, to deal the shafts of Fate! To yonder damp and dreary cave, From black Oblivion's silent wave, Borne on Desolation's wings, Death his poison'd chalice brings! Wide beneath the turbid sky, Fierce Rebellion's banners fly, Sweeping to her iron den The agonizing hearts of men! There, in many a ghastly throng, Blood-stain'd myriads glide along, While each above his crest a faulchion rears, Imbu'd with tepid gore, or drench'd with scalding tears! About yon tow'r, (whose grated cell Entombs the fairest child of earth, August in misery, as in birth) The hosts of Pandimonium dwell! Night and day the fiends conspire To glut their desolating ire: Ire that feeds on human woe, That smiling deals the murd'rous blow; And as the hopeless victim dies, Fills with shouts the threat'ning skies; Nor trembles, lest the vengeful light'ning's glare Should blast their recreant arms, and scatter them to air! Round the deep entrenchments stand Bold Ambition's giant band; Beneath, insidious Malice creeps, And keen Revenge that never sleeps; While dark Suspicion hovers near, Stung by the dastard scorpion, Fear; Reason, shrinking from her gaze, Flies the scene in wild amaze; While trembling Pity dies to see The barb'rous sons of Anarchy Drench their unnatural hands in human blood, While patriot Virtue sinks beneath the whelming flood! Hark! the petrifying shriek Breaks from yonder turret bleak; The lofty tower returns the sound, Echoing through its base profound! The rising moon, with paly light, Faintly greets the aching sight With many a gliding centinel, Whose shadow would his steps repel; Whose soul, convuls'd with conscious woe, Pants for the morning's purple glow, The purple glow that cheers his breast, And gives his startled mind a short-liv'd hour of rest. But when shall morn's effulgent light The hapless sufferer's glance invite? When shall the breath of rosy day Around the infant victims play? When will the vivifying orb The tears of widow'd love absorb? See, see, the palpitating breast, By the weeping graces drest, Now dumb with grief, now raving wild, Bending o'er each with'ring child, The only treasures spar'd by savage ire, The fading shadows of their murder'd sire! The seraph Hope, with transient light, Illumes the dreary shade of night; Suspends a while the frenzy'd shriek, The slow-pac'd tear of suff'rance meek: But soon the demon Wrath appears, Who braves the touch of mortal fears; His flaming sword, with hideous glare, Proves the dire signal of Despair! Retiring Hope beholds, subdu'd, The fatal mandate sign'd with blood, With kindred blood! Oh, horrible and base, To stigmatize with shame a long illustrious race! Oh, Fancy! spread thy powerful wing, From Hell's polluted confines spring; Quit, quit the cell where Madness lies, With wounded breast, and starting eyes! The ruthless fiends have done their worst, They triumph in the deed accurs'd. See, her veil Oblivion throws O'er the last of human woes! Life's curtain falls with many a crimson stain, Closing from every eye the scene of pain, While from afar the war-song dins the ear, And drowns the dying groan, which angels weep to hear. INVOCATION TO OBERON, Written on the Recovery of my Daughter from Inoculation. Lightly on the breath of morn See the shades of twilight borne; See the sun, in splendour drest, Lifting high his flaming crest! Earth receives him bath'd in tears, Sprinkled from the starry spheres, When the chilly pale-fac'd moon Journey'd to her shad'wy noon! Hark! a plaintive voice I hear, Whisp'ring to my pensive ear: “Oberon,” it seems to say, “Gentle Fairy, haste away; Haste on Health's ambrosial wing, Freshest dews of morning bring, Balmy breezes, such as spread Hebe's cheek with glowing red; Such as in Helvetia's bow'rs Gently fan the Austral show'rs! “Swift as thought, dear Spirit, fly, Wake to joy my darling's eye! Now with perfumes bathe her breast, Now compose her pangs to rest; Haste, exert thy magic pow'r, Danger lurks in ev'ry hour!” From the Tulip's ample dome, Anxious mourner, see, I come! Now behold my filmy vest, Gay with gaudy Cowslips drest! See the King-cup's burnish'd bell Half my dainty brows conceal; See my acorn goblet fill'd With drops of Ether, thrice distill'd; Wings I've stol'n, of rainbow die, From the vagrant Butterfly; Myrtle leaves my sandals are, Ty'd with strings of golden hair; Flossy streamers fan the wind, From the Silk-worm's web purloin'd, Which the toiling insect wove For the killing eyes of Love! For the God, as mortals know, Blindly twangs his fatal bow! While I top the beacon's head; While I skim o'er Ocean's bed, Ere the Sun, with burning eye, O'er the welkin's brow shall fly Or with fiery pinions sweep Proudly down the western steep; Or his burnish'd mantle fling O'er the dauntless eagle's wing; Ere upon the world below Evening's crimson blushes glow, Fair Maria's fev'rish lip Shall Hygeia's balsam sip! Many a verdant leaf I bear, Gifted with perfections rare! Stripp'd from roots of wond'rous pow'r, When at midnight's silent hour On the Zephyr's wings I sail, Sweeping from the Primrose pale Dew, that o'er its sickly face Sheds a ray of sparkling grace. Nor in these alone I find Charms to heal the wounded mind: From the Poppy I have ta'en Mortal's balm, and mortal's bane! Juice that, creeping through the heart, Deadens ev'ry sense of smart; Doom'd to heal, or doom'd to kill, Fraught with good, or fraught with ill. This I stole, when witches fell, Busy o'er a murd'rous spell, On the dark and barren plain, Echo'd back the night-owl's strain! While the winking stars withdrew, Shock'd their horrid rites to view. See, to crown the precious heap, Drops, that modest Vi'lets weep, When the rosy-bosom'd May Rushes forth in colours gay, Scatt'ring from her perfum'd wing All the rival flow'rs of Spring! Flow'rs that lift their haughty heads High above their native beds, Shading o'er the icy cheek Of the fainting Snow-drop meek! These shall sprinkle soothing balm, Ev'ry throbbing pulse to calm! Round Maria's aching head Soon the healing drops I'll shed: When they reach her languid eye, Soon the rending pang shall fly; From her pale and alter'd face, Health the sickly hue shall chase! Health, that through the bosom flows, And bathes the cheek—a living Rose! Nor e'en then will I depart From the gentle maiden's heart: Fondly vigilant, I'll fly O'er the earth, or through the sky; Still with restless pinions sweep O'er the terrors of the deep; Or with wings of light'ning soar High as Heav'n's star-spangl'd floor! When the silent Queen of night, Deck'd in silv'ry armour bright; Seated in her shad'wy chair, Sails, despotic, through the air! Till the monarch of the sky Bids the pale usurper fly, While the wanton Sprites and Fays Vanish from his potent gaze; Till, to cheer the sportive train, Witching Night returns again. Yes, where'er the damsel strays Through dull life's perplexing maze, Watchful Oberon shall be Guardian of her destiny! TO JULIUS. “Julia, by every Muse belov'd and blest, By every glowing grace that lifts that breast! By passion's soul, that fires the piercing eye, By Rapture's energy, by Pity's sigh, I charge thee, stoop not, e'en in anger just, To paint the pois'nous aspic of the dust.” JULIUS. ORACLE, October 7, 1791. The dusky veil of night was thrown O'er the flush'd forehead of the west, When thy soft harp's melodious tone Rous'd the faint tenant of my breast; A glow of joy my cheek o'erspread, The classic page I scarce could see, For Pride my raptur'd Fancy led To learn the lesson taught by thee. Yes, Julius, when the pensive breast, Sick of Life's gaudy fev'rish dream, Courts the cool hour of mental rest, And owns Youth's season but a dream! Sweet is the gale that wafts the sound That bids corroding anguish flee; And kind the voice of truth profound, And blest the Muse that sings like thee. But what avails the dulcet tone, The lesson Wisdom's voice can preach? Can Reason calm Affliction's groan, Or Maxims patient suff'rance teach? Know, lib'ral Bard, the vulgar throng Who point the ranc'rous shaft at me, Feel not the thrills of sacred song, Nor heed the precepts taught by thee! Yet in my bosom's ruby cell The philosophic lore shall live! For who can sooth the mind so well, With all the graceful Muse can give? And when the dart pale Envy wings, With recreant mischief aims at me, I'll turn where polish'd Julius sings, And mock the power of Destiny! And when weak Slander's subtle art Spits poison o'er the venal page, With the proud lyre I'll shield my heart, And, smiling, mock the feeble rage! So when the venom'd Spider stings, Whose wound no mortal can endure, Let the rapt minstrel sweep the strings, And heav'nly music yields a cure! STANZAS. [Bounding billow, cease thy motion] Written between Dover and Calais, in July 1792. Bounding billow, cease thy motion, Bear me not so swiftly o'er! Cease thy roaring, foamy Ocean! I will tempt thy rage no more. Ah! within my bosom beating, Varying passions wildly reign! Love, with proud resentment meeting, Throbs by turns of joy and pain! Joy, that far from foes I wander, Where their arts can reach no more; Pain, that woman's heart grows fonder, When the dream of bliss is o'er. Love, by fickle fancy banish'd, Spurn'd by Hope, indignant flies: Yet, when Love and Hope are vanish'd, Restless Mem'ry never dies! Far I go, where Fate shall lead me, Far across the troubled deep! Where no stranger's ear shall heed me, Where no eye for me shall weep. Proud has been my fatal passion, Proud my injur'd heart shall be! While each thought and inclination Proves that heart was form'd for thee! Not one sigh shall tell my story, Not one tear my cheek shall stain; Silent grief shall be my glory, Grief that stoops not to complain. Let the bosom, prone to ranging, Still, by ranging, seek a cure: Mine disdains the thought of changing, Proudly destin'd to endure! Yet, ere far from all I treasur'd, T?! ere I bid adieu, Ere my days of pain are measur'd, Take the song that's still thy due! Yet believe, no servile passions Seek to charm thy wand'ring mind; Well I know thy inclinations, Wav'ring as the passing wind! I have lov'd thee, dearly lov'd thee, Through an age of worldly woe! How ungrateful I have prov'd thee, Let my mournful exile show. Ten long years of anxious sorrow, Hour by hour, I counted o'er; Looking forward 'till to-morrow, Ev'ry day I lov'd thee more. Pow'r and splendour could not charm me, I no joy in wealth could see; Nor could threats or fears alarm me— Save the fear of losing thee. When the storms of fortune press'd thee, I have sigh'd to hear thee sigh; Or when sorrows dire distress'd thee, I have bid those sorrows fly! Often hast thou smiling told me, Wealth and pow'r were trifling things; While Love, smiling to behold me, Mock'd cold Time's destructive wings. When with thee, what ills could harm me? Thou couldst every pang assuage! Now, alas! what Hope can charm me? Every moment seems an age! Fare thee well, ungrateful rover! Welcome Gallia's hostile shore: Now the breezes waft me over; Now we part—to meet no more! STANZAS TO HIM WHO SAID, “WHAT IS LOVE?” “Say, what is Love?” I heard the sound Steal softly on the western gale; While flutt'ring Zephyrs, whisp'ring round, Bore to mine ear thy gentle tale. Dost thou not know?—Ah! minstrel sweet, I'll tell thee—Love is but a dream, A glitt'ring phantom, form'd to cheat, The rainbow of youth's sunny beam. On air-built throne the mischief dwells, Bright to the fascinated view; Serene amidst tempestuous spells, Disguis'd in tints of heav'nly hue! We gaze, we wonder at his charms, So passing fair the boy appears; His sighs the fiercest rage disarms, While cold indiff'rence melts in tears. So humble seems the weeping child, That Pity joys to see him blest; While Passion hastes with transport wild, And clasps him to her burning breast. And if the cunning Urchin smiles, The light-wing'd Pleasures flutt'ring nigh, 'Midst glowing blisses, sportive wiles, Snatch rapture from his laughing eye. For he can laugh, and sigh, and weep, Now frown severe, then smile again; And he can bid dull Sorrow sleep, Or dash the cup of Joy with pain. And he can cheer the throbbing breast, While Hope's bright flame illumes his eye; Can point the distant heav'n of rest, Then bid the flatt'ring vision fly. He can bid Poverty's sad child Repose upon his downy wing; Can lull to peace Distraction wild, And heal pale Misery's sharpest sting. But when, capricious, false, and vain, The tyrant shews his boasted pow'r, The sensate bosom throbs with pain, And cares the vital throne devour. Ah! then he triumphs—then he turns From Hope's fond gaze, indignant, cold; From his proud heart the wretch he spurns, And smiles his victim to behold. Ah, then he drinks the bitter tear, And mocks the soul-departing sigh; While his dread minion, jealous Fear, Proclaims that dark Despair is nigh! Unmov'd, he sees the languid look, The cheek slow-fading to decay, The breast by every hope forsook, The mind to with'ring grief a prey! He sees the wreath of Genius fade, Blasted by pale Oblivion's breath, As slow she seeks the fatal shade, Where Madness points the cave of Death. If o'er some tow'ring rock he bends, And, shrunk with anguish, weeps and raves; If black Despair his bosom rends, While from the steep the storm he braves; Or on the margin wild, forlorn, He meditates perpetual sleep; Or, on the ruthless whirlwinds borne, Hangs trembling o'er the howling deep: If to the Moon he tells his woes, When midnight guides her sable rein; Or shrieks with fierce convulsive throes, Till frenzy grasps his burning brain: Or if, in rosy graces drest, He lures thee to his fatal bow'r, And tells thee he will make thee blest With proud delight's extatic pow'r: Ah, heed him not, thou Minstrel sweet! The tempter courts but to abuse; From the fell traitor turn thy feet, And live—a fav'rite of the Muse! THE RECANTATION. TO LOVE. Tell not me of silv'ry sands, Rocks of coral, caves of gold; Love my votive song demands, Love can brighter themes unfold. Rove amidst Golconda's mines, Lave thy form 'midst pearly seas; While Love's spell around me twines, I can scorn such joys as these. Go, where Citron groves entwine, Where gigantic Aloes bloom; Love can form his myrtled shrine, 'Midst the rugged desart's gloom. Go, where Austral skies invite Perfum'd gales from roseate bow'rs, While, amidst the sultry night, Round thee balmy Ether show'rs. Go, where drops the tepid Vine, Where the honey'd Hybla glows; Let their sweetest gifts combine, Love has sweeter gifts than those. Go, where clouds of orient gold Gently sail o'er amber floods; Go, where musky flow'rs unfold, Shedding odours from their buds. Go, where Morn, with rosy crest, Shakes her golden tresses bright; Go, where Evening's glowing vest Clothes the plain in purple light. Still will sick'ning Fancy die, Sated with their gaudy hues: So the trav'ller's aching eye Day's effulgent lustre views. Come then, Love, delicious Boy! Come, in all thy charms array'd: Thine alone is real joy, All the rest a glitt'ring shade. I with thee will climb the steep Where the brawling torrents flow, Rushing with impetuous sweep To the quiv'ring lake below. I with thee will wander far, Where the rippling river strays, While the twinkling evening star Shoots around its feeble rays; Till the pallid Queen of Night, Rising, lifts her silver wreath, Spreading soft and trembling light O'er the silent world beneath. Then, I'll lead thee to my home, Blest retreat of mental joys, Far from Folly's splendid dome, Far from Fashion's trivial toys. Then, I'll court thee to repose On my mossy pillow rude, Where false friends and envious foes Dare not break our solitude. Come then, Love, delicious Boy! Come, in all thy charms array'd; Thine alone is real joy, All the rest a glitt'ring shade. THE FUGITIVE. Oft have I seen yon solitary man Pacing the upland meadow. On his brow Sits melancholy, mark'd with decent pride, As it would fly the busy taunting world, And feed upon reflection. Sometimes, near The foot of an old tree, he takes his seat, And with the page of legendary lore Cheats the dull hour, while Evening's sober eye Looks tearful as it closes. In the dell By the swift brook he loiters, sad and mute, Save when a struggling sigh, half murmur'd, steals From his wrung bosom. To the rising Moon, His eye rais'd wistfully, expression fraught, He pours the cherish'd anguish of his soul, Silent, yet eloquent: For not a sound That might alarm the night's lone centinel, The dull-ey'd Owl, escapes his trembling lip, Unapt in supplication. He is young, And yet the stamp of thought so tempers youth, That all its fires are faded. What is He? And why, when morning sails upon the breeze, Fanning the blue hill's summit, does he stay Loit'ring and sullen, like a truant boy, Beside the woodland glen; or stretch'd along On the green slope, watch his slow wasting form Reflected, trembling, on the river's breast? His garb is coarse and threadbare, and his cheek Is prematurely faded. The check'd tear, Dimming his dark eye's lustre, seems to say, “This world is now, to me, a barren waste, A desart, full of weeds and wounding thorns, And I am weary: for my journey here Has been, though short, but cheerless.” Is it so? Poor traveller! Oh tell me, tell me all— For I, like thee, am but a Fugitive, An alien from delight, in this dark scene! And, now I mark thy features, I behold The cause of thy complaining. Thou art here A persecuted exile! one, whose soul, Unbow'd by guilt, demands no patronage From blunted feeling, or the frozen hand Of gilded Ostentation. Thou, poor Priest! Art here, a stranger, from thy kindred torn— Thy kindred massacred! thy quiet home, The rural palace of some village scant, Shelter'd by vineyards, skirted by fair meads, And by the music of a shallow rill Made ever cheerful, now thou hast exchang'd For stranger woods and vallies. What of that? Here, or on torrid desarts; o'er the world Of trackless waves, or on the frozen cliffs Of black Siberia, thou art not alone! For there, on each, on all, the Deity Is thy companion still! Then, exiled man! Be cheerful as the Lark that o'er yon hill In Nature's language, wild, yet musical, Hails the Creator! nor thus sullenly Repine, that, through the day, the sunny beam Of lust'rous fortune gilds the palace roof, While thy short path, in this wild labyrinth, Is lost in transient shadow. Who, that lives, Hath not his portion of calamity? Who, that feels, can boast a tranquil bosom? The fever, throbbing in the tyrant's veins In quick, strong language, tells the daring wretch That he is mortal, like the poorest slave Who wears his chain, yet healthfully suspires. The sweetest Rose will wither, while the storm Passes the mountain thistle. The bold Bird, Whose strong eye braves the ever-burning orb, Falls like the summer Fly, and has at most But his allotted sojourn. Exiled Man, Be cheerful! Thou art not a fugitive! All are thy kindred—all thy brothers, here— The hoping—trembling creatures—of one God! THE BIRTH-DAY. Here bounds the gaudy gilded chair, Bedeck'd with fringe, and tassels gay; The melancholy Mourner there Pursues her sad and painful way. Here, guarded by a motley train, The pamper'd Countess glares along; There, wrung by poverty and pain, Pale Mis'ry mingles with the throng. Here, as the blazon'd chariot rolls, And prancing horses scare the crowd, Great names, adorning little souls, Announce the empty, vain, and proud. Here four tall lacquies slow precede A painted dame, in rich array; There the sad shiv'ring child of need Steals barefoot o'er the flinty way. “Room, room! stand back!” they loudly cry, The wretched poor are driv'n around On ev'ry side, they scatter'd fly, And shrink before the threat'ning sound. Here, amidst jewels, feathers, flow'rs, The senseless Duchess sits demure; Heedless of all the anguish'd hours The sons of modest worth endure. All silver'd, and embroider'd o'er, She neither knows nor pities pain; The Beggar freezing at her door She overlooks with nice disdain. The wretch whom poverty subdues Scarce dares to raise his tearful eye; Or if by chance the throng he views, His loudest murmur is a sigh! The poor wan mother, at whose breast The pining infant craves relief, In one thin tatter'd garment drest, Creeps forth to pour the plaint of grief. But ah! how little heeded here The fault'ring tongue reveals its woe; For high-born fools, with frown austere, Contemn the pangs they never know. “Take physic, Pomp!” let Reason say, “What can avail thy trappings rare? The tomb shall close thy glitt'ring day, The beggar prove thy equal there!” THE FISHERMAN. Along the smooth and glassy stream The little boat glides slow; And while beneath the rosy beam Of setting sun the waters glow, The fisherman is singing gay, “Sweet is the hour of setting day.” The net, expanded wide, displays The snare of direful fate; And where the finny victim plays The shafts of Death unseen await! And still the fisherman is gay, Singing at close of summer's day. The zephyrs on each willow bed In busy whispers fly, And o'er the lowly, peaceful shed The mournful screech-owls hov'ring cry; Yet still the fisherman can say, “How cheerful is the close of day!” The rising moon, with quiv'ring light, Along the river throws A soft beam from the brow of night, And still a mimic day bestows; While on the smooth and liquid way The silent fisherman is gay. The rosy dawn above the hills Scatters the sev'ring clouds, And myriads flitting o'er the rills, The violet-scented margin shrouds: And from his hut, to greet the day, The fisherman comes blythe and gay. Happy is he who never knew The idle pride of state! Who, stranger to the sordid crew, Lives unmolested by the great; Who labours thro' his little day, And, pleas'd with labour, still is gay. Poor Fisherman! would man like thee Contented pass his hour; Would those of loftier destiny Forbear to use the rod of pow'r— How man thro' life's busy day Would sing like thee—belov'd and gay! STANZAS. [Since Fortune's smiles too often give] Since Fortune's smiles too often give Respect to fools, to knaves renown, Let Reason bid me calmly live, And Fortune mark me with a frown! For who would buy the wretched state Which conscious vice or dullness knows? Or who be vainly, meanly great, With pow'r that from oppression grows? While Nature, with a partial hand, Her darling children beckons forth; While fools and knaves usurp command, And Fortune flies from modest worth! Then give, oh! Fortune! all thy store To insects of a sunny day; While I the paths of truth explore, And smile the darkest hour away. THE WORST OF ILLS. What wounds more deep than arrows keen Piercing the heart subdu'd; What renders life a dreary scene? Thy sting, Ingratitude! For ev'ry pain that man can know Has still an antidote for woe, Save where Ingratitude is found Giving its deep and deadly wound. Does Love neglected, pining sad, On ev'ry joy obtrude; Does Pleasure fly the bosom glad. Stung by Ingratitude? Oh, yes! for what is life to those Who find no hour of soft repose, Who trace in ev'ry path that weed Which bids the feeling bosom bleed? Thou fiend Ingratitude! to thee All lesser evils bend; Thou potent shaft of destiny, Where will thy poisons end? The wretch who smarts beneath thy fang, Day after day endures the pang, And finds there is no balm to cure Thy wound, for ever deep and sure! Where'er in life's precarious scene My weary feet have stray'd, Thou hast my taunting follower been In sunshine and in shade. In poverty I found thee ever The bonds of social feelings sever; And when I sunk by grief subdu'd, I felt thy wound, Ingratitude! I found thee in the smile of Love, In Friendship's sacred vest, In rustic meekness saw thee move, Pois'ning the untaught breast. When Fortune, often dull and blind, Heap'd splendour on the vulgar mind, Scattering on pride and vice her favour, Ingratitude, I found thee ever! Thou Imp destructive! bane of rest, Turn from my aching heart; Nor still in artful kindness drest, Thy fatal stings impart. This bosom, long assail'd by thee, No more thy victim slave shall be; No more shall be by thee subdu'd, Thou worst of ills—Ingratitude! THE GAMESTER. Say, what is he, whose haggard eye Scarce dares to meet the morning ray? Who, trembling, would, but cannot fly From man, and from the busy day? Mark how his lip is fever'd o'er, Behold his cheek, how deathly it appears! See! how his bloodshot eye-balls pour A burning torrent of unpitied tears! Now watch the varying gesture wild, See how his tortur'd bosom heaves! Behold Misfortune's wayward child, For whom no kindred bosom grieves! Despis'd, suspected, ruin'd, lost, His fortune, health, and reputation flown— On Mis'ry's stormy ocean tost, Condemn'd to curse his fate—and curse alone! Once were his prospects bright and gay, And Independence blest his hours; This was the smooth and sunny way Where tip-toe Pleasure scatter'd flow'rs: Love bound his brow with thornless sweets, And Friendship, smiling, fill'd his cup of joy: Now, not a friend the wand'rer meets, For, like a wolf—he wanders to destroy! All day upon a couch of thorn His weary fev'rish limbs recline; All night, distracted and forlorn, He hovers round the fateful shrine: Eager to seize, with grasping hands, The slender pittance of each easy fool, He links himself with caitiff bands, And learns the lesson of the gamesters' school! One hour elate with ill-got gold, And dazzled by the shining ore, In plenitude of joys behold The Prodigal display his store! The next in poverty and fear, He hides him, trembling at approaching fate, While greedy creditors appear, And with remorseless rage lurk round his gate. Then comes the horror-breeding hour! While recreant Suicide attends; Or Madness, with impetuous pow'r, The scene of desolation ends! Upon his grave no Parent mourns, No widow'd Love laments with graceful woe; No dawn of joy for him returns, For Heav'n denies that peace his frenzy lost below! MY NATIVE HOME. O'er breezy hill and woodland glade, At morning's dawn or closing day, In summer's flaunting pomp array'd, Or pensive moonlight's silver grey, The wretch in sadness still shall roam Who wanders from his native home. While at the foot of some old tree, As meditation soothes his mind, Lull'd by the hum of wand'ring bee, Or rippling stream, or whisp'ring wind, His vagrant fancy still shall roam, And lead him to his native home. Though Love a fragrant couch may weave, And Fortune heap a festive board, Still Mem'ry oft would turn to grieve, And Reason scorn the splendid board; While he, beneath the proudest dome, Would languish for his native home. To him the rushy roof is dear, And sweetly calm the darkest glen; While noise, and pomp, and pow'r, appear, At best, the glitt'ring plagues of men; Unsought by those who never roam, Forgetful of their native home. Let me to summer shades retire, With meditation and the Muse; Or round the social winter fire The glow of temper'd mirth diffuse: Though winds may howl and waters roam, I still shall bless my native home. THE SUMMER DAY. Ah! who beneath the burning ray Can bear the long, long summer's day? Who, 'mid the dust and scorching sun, Content, his daily race will run? And yet, when winter's icy breath Flies o'er the white and frozen heath, The wand'rer shudders to behold The dreary scene, and shrinks with cold. When drifted snow across the plain Spreads desolation's chill domain, The Trav'ller, sighing, seems to say, “Ah! wou'd it were a summer's day!” Yet when the sun flames far and wide, He hastens to the wood's dark side, And, shelter'd by embow'ring trees, Sighs for the fresh and cooling breeze! When dusty roads impede his way, And all around the fervid ray Scorches the dry and yellow heath, Unvisited by Zephyr's breath: Or, when the torrent wildly pours, When the fierce blast impetuous roars, Man, still on changes fondly bent, Still murmurs, sad and discontent! THE WINTRY DAY. Is it in mansions rich and gay, On downy beds, or couches warm, That Nature owns the wintry day, And shrinks to hear the howling storm? Ah! No! Tis on the bleak and barren heath, Where Mis'ry feels the ice of death, As to the dark and freezing grave Her children, not a friend to save, Unheeded go! Is it in chambers silken drest, At tables which profusions heap, Is it on pillows soft to rest, In dreams of long and balmy sleep? Ah! No! 'Tis in the rushy hut obscure, Where Poverty's low sons endure, And, scarcely daring to repine, On a straw pallet, mute, recline, O'erwhelm'd with woe! Is it to flaunt in warm attire, To laugh, to feast, and dance, and sing; To crowd around the blazing fire, And make the roof with revels ring? Ah! No! 'Tis on the prison's flinty floor, 'Tis where the deaf'ning whirlwinds roar; 'Tis when the Sea-boy, on the mast, Hears the wave bounding to the blast, And looks below! 'Tis in a cheerless naked room, Where Mis'ry's victims wait their doom, Where a fond mother famish'd dies, While forth a frantic father flies, Man's desp'rate foe! Is it where gamesters thronging round, Their shining heaps of wealth display? Where fashion's giddy tribes are found, Sporting their senseless hours away? Ah! No! 'Tis in the silent spot obscure, Where, forc'd all sorrows to endure, Pale Genius learns—oh! lesson sad! To court the vain, and on the bad False praise bestow! Where the neglected Hero sighs, Where Hope, exhausted, silent dies, Where Virtue starves, by Pride oppress'd, 'Till ev'ry stream that warms the breast Forbears to flow! LINES WRITTEN ON A SICK BED, 1797. Another night of fev'rish pain Has slowly pass'd away! I see the morning light again; What does it bring? another day Of Hope—delusive—vain! Another night of busy thought Has stol'n uncheerly on! And what has rosy morning brought? Is anguish with the lone hour gone, The hour with darkness fraught? I see again the chearful light, But still my soul's forlorn! The sun-beam glitters, all is bright, Soft dews the fragrant fields adorn, But still to me 'tis night! A sullen gloom o'erwhelms my mind, While slow the hours creep on; For wheresoe'er I gaze I find Dark weeds to feast my soul upon, With Mem'ry's thorns entwin'd. I see Deceit in sainted guise Of holy Friendship, smile; I mark Oppression's eager eyes, And tremble as the breath of Guile Assumes Affection's sighs. Then, bed of sickness! thou to me No keener pangs canst bring; I have familiar grown with thee; And while the scorpion sorrows sting My soul no joy can see. Yet, bed of sickness! while my breast In fev'rish throbs shall rise My cheek shall smile—and endless rest Anticipating Hope supplies Hereafter—with the blest! ON LEAVING THE COUNTRY FOR THE WINTER SEASON, 1799. Ye leafless woods, ye hedge-rows bare, Farewel! awhile farewel! Now busy scenes, my thoughts must share Scenes of low guile, Where shrewd Hypocrisy shall smile, And empty Folly dwell! Ye rising floods, ye mountains bleak, Farewel! awhile farewel! The din of mingling tones I seek; The midnight gloom I change, for the light taper'd room Where sounds unmeaning swell. Ye meadows wide, that skirt the stream, Farewel, awhile farewel! Ye green banks, where the summer beam, So rich and gay, Among the fragrant buds would play Adown the silent dell. Now dark and dreary hours I see, I hear the deaf'ning noise; The troublous scene returns to me, Who sick'ning sigh For the soft breeze, and summer sky, With all their glowing joys! Yet, yet, where'er my course I bend, May ev'ry hour be blest With the sweet converse of a friend! The smile that shows A calm contempt for human woes: Then, Splendour take the rest! WRITTEN AT BRIGHTON. The evening sun now sinks serene, Flush'd Ocean's glowing waves between; The purpling sky is fading fast, With tints of varying hue o'ercast; The sultry breezes fan the deep, And bid the restless billows sleep; The glooms of night will soon o'erspread The blue hills solitary head; And all of Nature's tribe shall rest, All but the Lover's aching breast! Now o'er yon dark and rocky bed The sea weed waves its sable head! The moon her silver crescent rears, To deck with modest light the spheres; The moaning of the distant deep Marks where the twilight breezes sleep; And hark! the sea-bird's lonely cry Awakes the Lover's heart to sigh! STANZAS TO REST. When hidden fears the bosom tears, And love no longer cheats the breast, Hope comes to break the spells of care, And give the tortur'd bosom rest. The world looks gay, the shadows past, All Nature smiles, by Fancy drest: But soon the day of bliss o'ercast Will prove—how short a lover's rest! The gentle breeze that fans the main, Scarce seems to move the Halcyon's nest, Soon yields to winter's potent reign, And storms succeed the transient rest. Then let the wretch, whom Pleasure flies, Ne'er think that Rapture's sons are blest, For Apathy alone supplies The sweet, the envied balm of rest! A WISH. Heav'n knows I never would repine, Though Fortune's fiercest frowns were mine, If Fate would grant, that o'er my tomb One little laurel branch might bloom, And Mem'ry sometimes wander near To bid it live—and drop a tear! I never would, for all the show That tinsel splendour can bestow, Or waste a thought, or heave a sigh, For well I know 'tis pageantry! Soon fading to the grave, 'tis o'er— A pleasing phantom, seen no more! I ask not worldly pow'r, to rule The drooping child of mis'ry's school: To tyrannize o'er him whom Fate Has destin'd to a lowly state, To me would prove a source of woe More keen than such a wretch could know. Oh! did the little great endure The pangs they seldom stoop to cure! Could pamper'd luxury then find The charm to sooth the wounded mind! The loftiest, proudest, would confess The sweetest pow'r—the power to bless. Give me the sensate mind, that knows The vast extent of human woes; And then, for independence, grant The means to chear the child of want: Though small the pittance, mine should be The boundless joys of Sympathy! But though ungentle Fortune flies, And envious Fate her smile denies, My heart will never cease to feel The wounds it vainly hopes to heal: Then Fate, to prove thy rage is o'er, Ah! let me die—and feel no more! FAREWEL TO GLENOWEN. Farewel, dear Glenowen! adieu to thy mountains, Where oft I have wander'd to welcome the day; Farewel to thy forests, thy crystalline fountains, Which stray through the valley, and moan as they stray. O'er wide foamy waters I'm destin'd to travel, A poor simple exile, forlorn and unknown; Yet while the dark Fates shall my fortune unravel, My thoughts, my affections, shall still be thy own. Thy cities, proud Gallia, thy wide-spreading treasures, Thy vallies, where Nature luxuriantly roves, May bid the heart, dancing to Fancy's wild measures, Forget, for a moment, its own native groves. But where is the bosom that sighs not in sorrow, Estrang'd from dear objects to wander alone: Still counting the moments from morrow to morrow, A poor weary traveller, lost and unknown. Sweet vistas of myrtle, and paths of gay roses, And hills deck'd with vineyards, and woodlands with shade, Fresh banks of young vi'lets, where Fancy reposes, And courts gentle slumbers her visions to aid; The dark silent grotto, the soft-flowing fountains, Where Nature's own music slow murmurs along; The sun-beams that dance on the pine-cover'd mountains, May waken to rapture their own native throng. But thou, dear Glenowen! can'st bring sweeter pleasure, All barren and bleak as thy summits appear; And tho' thou can'st boast of no rich gaudy treasure, Still Memory traces thy charms with a tear! The keen blast may howl o'er thy vallies and mountains, And strip the rich verdure that mantles each tree; And winter may bind in cold fetters thy fountains, And still thou art dear, O Glenowen! to me. TO SPRING. Written after a Winter of Ill Health in the Year 1800. Life glowing season! odour-breathing Spring! Deck'd in cerulean splendours, vivid, warm, Shedding soft lustre on the rosy hours, And calling forth their beauties! Balmy Spring! To thee the vegetating world begins To pay fresh homage. Ev'ry southern gale Whispers thy coming; every tepid show'r Revivifies thy charms. The mountain breeze Wafts th' ethereal essence to the vale, While the low vale returns its fragrant hoard With ten-fold sweetness. When the dawn unfolds Its purple splendours 'mid the dappled clouds, Thy influence chears the soul. When noon uplifts Its burning canopy, spreading the plain Of Heav'n's own radiance with one vast of light, Thou smil'st triumphant! Ev'ry little flow'r Seems to exult in thee, delicious Spring, Luxuriant nurse of Nature! By the stream That winds its swift course down the mountain's side, Thy progeny are seen,—young Primroses, And all the varying buds of wildest birth, Dotting the green slope gaily. On the thorn Which arms the hedge-row, the young birds invite With merry minstrelsy, shrilly and maz'd With winding cadences; now quick, now sunk In the low twitter'd song. The ev'ning sky Reddens the distant main, catching the sail Which slowly lessens, and with crimson hue Varying the sea-green wave; while the young Moon, Scarce visible amid the warmer tints Of western splendours, slowly lifts her brow, Modest and icy-lustred! O'er the plain The light dews rise, sprinkling the thistle's head, And hanging in clear drops on the wild waste Of broomy fragrance. Season of delight! Thou soul-expanding pow'r, whose wond'rous glow Can bid all Nature smile!—Ah! why to me Come unregarded, undelighting still This ever-mourning bosom? So I've seen The sweetest flow'rets bind the icy urn, The brightest sun-beams glitter on the grave, And the soft zephyr kiss the troublous main With whisper'd murmurs. Yes, to me, O Spring! Thou com'st unwelcom'd by a smile of joy; To me! slow with'ring to that silent grave, Where all is blank and dreary. Yet once more The Spring eternal of the soul shall dawn, Unvisited by clouds, by storms, by change, Radiant and unexhausted! Then, ye buds, Ye plumy minstrels, and ye balmy gales, Adorn your little hour, and give your joys To bless the fond world-loving traveller, Who smiling measures the long flow'ry path That leads to Death! For to such wand'rers Life is a busy, pleasing, chearful dream, And the last hour unwelcome. Not to me, O! not to me, stern Death, art thou a foe: Thou art the welcome messenger that brings A passport to a blest and long repose! THE EXILE. Lost on a rock of dreadful height, And shrouded by the gloom of night, A weary exile stood! No wint'ry star its feeble ray Shot forth to point the craggy way, Or guide his devious steps to shun the foamy flood. Above, the warring tempest howl'd, And near the rav'nous She-wolf prowl'd, A cataract plung'd below! He shrunk!—the bleak blast yell'd around He totter'd o'er the gulph profound, While ev'ry startled sense was agoniz'd by woe. For robb'd of joy, of peace bereft, Adversity no balsam left To heal the stings of scorn; No sigh of love his pain beguil'd, On him no friend, no kindred, smil'd, To draw from Memory's wound affliction's rank ling thorn! Disdain'd by Fortune, stung by Art, And tortur'd with a feeling heart, Which Hope had left to break! His sigh was lost amid the blast, And Fancy, madd'ning on the past, Bade tears, corroding tears, steal down his wither'd cheek. Then why should he, with haggard eye, Start from the She-wolf prowling nigh, Or dread the gulph below? Why totter o'er the dreadful steep, And bear the pelting storm, and weep, When one short step would end the tyranny of woe? Poor exile! why such fears endure, When Nature's hand presents a cure, Which only death can give? Methinks the wretched wand'rer cries— “Guilt seeks the grave—the coward dies, While virtue nobly dares to suffer and to live!” STANZAS. [When the bleak blast of Winter howls o'er the blue hill] When the bleak blast of Winter howls o'er the blue hill, And the valley is stripp'd of its verdant array, When the Moon faintly gleams o'er the frost-silver'd spray, And the yellow leaves flit o'er the ice mantled rill: The poor simple offspring of labour and care, By his turf-lighted hearth sits resign'd to his lot, While the flame of affection illumines his cot, And the often-told tale cheers the gloom of despair. For him the blest beam of the soul-speaking eye, The smile of pure Love, have their raptures in store; And though the wild storm round his threshold shall roar, He sinks to soft slumber, and dreams but of joy. No hopeless fond passion corrodes in his breast, His rude rushy pillow invites to repose; No couch of light down and rich fragrance he knows, But he knows what is sweeter—a pallet of rest! For what are the pleasures the world can bestow— The gay mirthful scene, or the banquet profuse? What the laurel of Fame, or the song of the Muse, When the heart bleeds in silence, the victim of woe? O'er each prospect of bliss that fond fancy illumes, The fix'd brow of Prudence frowns sadly severe, While my cheek, warm with blushes, is chill'd by Love's tear, And the sigh of Regret fans the flame that consumes: For, perish the heart that can meanly desire The cold balm of Pity to sooth its despair! My passion shall scorn the dear object to share, And, exulting in silence, shall proudly expire! Yes, in silence, proud silence, I'll muse o'er his worth, Though reflection shall steal the faint Rose from my cheek, Though my eye's faded lustre its poison shall speak, And my heart-bursting sighs bend my frame to the earth! Then rest, my sad bosom—henceforth be at peace! Thy hopes and thy anguish will shortly be o'er: Stern Prudence shall frown on thy passion no more, For in Death's cold embrace all thy sorrows will cease! REFLECTIONS. “To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time.” Shakspere's Macbeth. Ah! who has pow'r to say, To-morrow's Sun shall warmer glow, And o'er this gloomy vale of woe Diffuse a brighter ray? Ah! who is ever sure, Though all that can the soul delight This hour enchants the wond'ring sight, These raptures will endure? Is there in Life's dull toil, One certain moment of repose, One ray to dissipate our woes, And bid Reflection smile? What is the mind of man? A chaos where the passions blend, Unconscious where the mass will end, Or when it first began! In childhood's thoughtless hours We frolic through the sportive day; Each path enchanting, sunny, gay, All deck'd with gaudy flow'rs! In Life's maturer prime We wander still in search of Peace; And, as our weary toils encrease, Fade in the glooms of Time. From scene to scene we stray, Still courting Pleasure's fickle smile, While she, delighting to beguile, Still farther glides away. We seek Hope's gentle aid, We think the lovely Phantom pours Her balmy incense on those flow'rs, Which blossom but to fade! We court Love's thrilling dart, And when we think our joys supreme, We find its raptures but a dream— Its boon, a wounded heart! We pant for glitt'ring Fame, And when pale Envy blots the page That might have charm'd a future age, We find 'tis but a name. We toil for paltry ore, And when we gain the golden prize, And Death appears!—with aching eyes We view the useless store. We bask in Friendship's beam, But when malignant cares assail, And Fortune's fickle favours fail, We find 'tis but a dream! We pine for idle joy; Intemp'rance leads to sure decay; The brightest prospects fade away, The sweetest—soonest cloy! How frail is Beauty's bloom! The dimpled cheek—the sparkling eye, Scarce seen, before their wonders fly To decorate a tomb! Then, since this fleeting breath Is but the zephyr of a day, Let conscience make each minute gay, And brave the shafts of Death! And let the gen'rous mind With Pity view the erring throng, Applaud the right, forgive the wrong, And feel for all mankind. For who, alas, shall say, “To-morrow's sun shall warmer glow, And o'er this gloomy vale of woe Diffuse a brighter ray.” END OF THE SECOND VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. THE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY. BOOK THE FIRST. Hail, liberty sublime! hail godlike pow'r, Coëval with the skies, to earth new born; Thou parent of delight, thou source refin'd Of human energy! Thou fountain vast From whose immortal stream the soul of man Imbibes celestial fervour! But for thee, O! best and noblest attribute of God! Who would the coil endure of mortal woe, The frowns of fortune, or the taunts of pride Float with the gale, or buffet with the storm; Who labour thro' the busy dream of time, War with oppression, or resist the base; Opposing ever, and by each oppos'd, To count succeeding conflicts; and to die? Hail, liberty! legitimate of Heav'n! Who, on a mountain's solitary brow First started into life; thy sire, old time; Thy mother, blooming, innocent, and gay, The genius of the scene! Thy beauteous form She gave to nature; on whose fragrant lap, Nurs'd by the breath of morn, each glowing vein Soon throbb'd with healthful streams. Thy sparkling eyes Snatch'd radiance from the sun! while ev'ry limb, By custom unrestrain'd, grew firm and strong. Thy midnight cradle, rock'd by howling winds, Lull'd thee to wholesome rest. Thy bev'rage pure, The wild brook gushing from the rocky steep, And foaming, unimpeded, down the vale. For thee no victim bled; no groan of death Stole on the sighing gale to pitying Heav'n! Thy food the herbage sweet, or wand'ring vine Bursting its luscious bounds, and scatt'ring wide The purple stream nectareous. O'er the hills, Veil'd with an orient canopy sublime, 'Twas thine to rove unshackl'd; or to weave Young mountain flow'rs to deck thy flowing hair, But not confine it. Where thy footsteps fell, No vagrant bud was crush'd; for swift and light As summer breezes, flew thy active limbs, Scarce brushing the soft dews. Thy song divine, Warbled with all the witchery of sound, Welcom'd the varied year; nor mark'd the change Of passing seasons: for to thee the morn (Whether Favonius op'd the sunny east, Flaunting its lustrous harbinger of light, Or slow the paly glimpse of Winter's eye Peer'd on the frozen brow of sickly day), Still wore an aspect lovely! Ev'ning's star, Spangling the purple splendours of the west, And glowing, 'midst infinity of space, Temper'd by twilight's tears, still smil'd on thee, And bade thee dream of rapture! Nor could night, With all its glooms opake, its howling blasts— Thunders, appalling to the guilty soul— Or livid fires, winging the shafts of death, Shake the soft slumbers of thy halcyon home. The wild was thy domain! at morn's approach Thy bounding form uprose to meet the sun, Thyself its proud epitome! For thou, Like the vast orb, wert destin'd to illume The mist-encircled world; to warm the soul, To call the pow'rs of teeming reason forth, And ratify the laws by nature made! Long didst thou live, unruling and unrul'd, The reveller of nature's wide domain! 'Till weary of thy solitude sublime, And seeking bliss, beyond the bliss of Heav'n, Thy truant steps the mazy haunts of men Unheeded trod. Thy mighty voice was heard Amidst the groans of anguish and despair, The din of revelry, or silence deep Of dungeon horrors; while high-bearing pride, First taught to feel, her ghastly visage wrapp'd In superstition's cowl. Ambition next Assum'd the mask of valour; till revenge Mock'd the shrewd spoiler. Terror then rush'd forth; Her eyes glar'd wildly through the specious tears Of holy sorrow; while her livid lip Mutter'd relentless curses, each approv'd By folly, cruelty, oppression, pride: Confederate fiends, that trampled on the laws Of bleeding nature. While they stood aghast, Thy bosom bare, and form of godlike mould, Burst on their startled gaze! they shrunk appall'd, Trembling and pale! But soon the torpid spell Of broad-ey'd horror vanish'd, and each arm Was rais'd for slaughter. Legions bold uprose, While fierce despair a frantic phalanx form'd To intercept thy path! The daring host At thy command gave way. Still, urg'd by fate, Onward thou cam'st, o'er cliffs stupendous; where Dark-brow'd deceit hung brooding o'er the wave That lash'd the sands below. Down the dread gulf, Oblivion's black domain, unnumber'd fiends Hurl'd shrieking victims; spirits that rebell'd, And spurn'd oppression's chain. Upon a rock (Which seem'd the top-most beacon of the world), A lofty fabric stood, whose ebon tow'rs Shadow'd their pond'rous gates. At thy approach The bolts flew wide, and with a thund'ring crash The scene disclos'd! There on his iron throne Terrifically frown'd despotic power, A giant strong! his vassals, bound in chains (Artfully twin'd with wreaths of opiate flow'rs, Thro' which the clanking links sad music made), Stood trembling at his gaze. Beneath his feet Pale captives groan'd; while shad'wy spectres dire, Of persecuted innocence and worth; Of genius, bent to an untimely grave;— Of ethiops, burnt beneath their native sun, Their countless wounds wide yawning for revenge, Rose in a mighty host,—and yell'd despair!— The flinty fabric shook! the thund'ring spheres Frown'd, dark as Erebus! upon its base The Pandemonium rock'd! while with'ring bolts From heav'n's red citadel fell fast around. The vex'd sea, swoln above its tow'ring walls, Foam'd madly furious. The gigantic fiend Wav'd high his adamantine wand in vain; Thy potent grasp palsy'd the monster's arm, And hurl'd him fathoms down his native hell! All earth convulsive yawn'd; while nature's hand Crush'd the infernal throne, and in its stead, A thousand temples rose, each dedicate To valour, reason, liberty, and fame! Now from her dark and solitary cell Suspicion started, vigilant and shrewd, Fear in her eye, and malice in her breast: She scowl'd around, trembling, perplex'd, amaz'd, Scarce daring to believe, yet more afraid To doubt her startled senses. Ev'ry breeze That whisper'd peril to the ear of night, Bathing its ebon cheek with humid fears, Bade her be wary: ev'ry blushing dawn Beheld a scene of blood. The public streets Flow'd with ensanguin'd streams: the prisons groan'd With vengeful minions; while the subtle slaves Aim'd at the breast of freedom. For a time Valour with-held the desolating sword, And pity offer'd to the lips of pride The cup capacious, fill'd with essence pure, Drawn from the fount of reason. Shrewd revenge, With all the restless demons of her train, Thirsting for blood, the sacred pledge receiv'd; And while the eye of pity turn'd to heav'n, Infus'd a deadly poison! on themselves The fatal vengeance fell; they drank—and died! Now the broad eye of freedom, like the sun, Flam'd on the northern world! an awful beam Descending mark'd the solitary path To the dim cloister, where the vestal sad Wither'd thro' life's dull hour in ling'ring death; Her spring of youth chill'd by untimely frost, And all the warm perceptions of her soul Spell-bound by sorrow! What were her pursuits? Fasting and pray'r; long nights of meditation; And days consum'd in tears. The matin songs, By repetition dull, familiar grown, Pass'd o'er her lip mechanically cold, And little mark'd devotion. The wing'd choir, Blithe airy travellers of the sphery climes, Hover'd around the grey and mould'ring spires Of her dim habitation. Could their songs, Their dulcet warblings and wild mazy trills, Sooth the wan mourner's breast, or prompt her thoughts Anticipating freedom? The cold moon, Scatt'ring nocturnal incense on the world, Stole o'er her lonely prison, sadly pale, Rob'd in a starry vest; her crescent bright Silver'd the ivy battlements; the haunts Of that lone bird, whose melancholy note, Breaking the solitude, from fev'rish dreams Startl'd her aching breast. The fervid noon No streamy light bestow'd to gild the cell Where bigot frenzy barr'd the icy grate, And spread perpetual horrors! Day retir'd; The gaudy monarch of unbounded space, Furling his ample vest of blushing gold, Hie'd to his dusky bed; the vesper bell, Pale twilight's sound funereal, rous'd her soul From transient spells of contemplation sad, By small and silver sounds; vibrations sweet! Yet not more sweet than solemn. Hapless maid! On the cold marble of her cell she kneel'd To chant her midnight orisons, and mourn, The slave confess'd of passion and despair! 'Twas her's to breathe upon her cross the sigh Of unavailing grief, while love's pure torch, In the mild radiance of her humid eyes, Gleams like an April sun thro' passing show'rs, To shew another idol in her breast! Her smooth cheek reddens thro' the snowy veil That half conceals its bloom: ah! transient bloom! The self-reproving flush of conscious love, Which, like the wood-wild rose, unfolds its hues, And, drest with morning's tears, expires unseen! Counting her beads, she number'd not her pray'rs: Yet who can blame the vestal's wand'ring thoughts? Could the day past, to her reflecting mind Shew consolation? Could the relique cold Chill the warm pulse that throbs within her breast, Or chasten its rebellion, while no gleam Of peace was her's, save that which hope unfolds, The quiet of the grave? O! beamless grave! Thou sombre curtain, which o'er life's dull scene Throws blank oblivion; while the busy throng Are bound in apathy, 'till lab'ring time Dissolves them into nothing! Yet the spark Of immortality, escap'd the bounds Of its dark prison-clay, roves, unconfin'd, Thro' regions infinite, and worlds unknown! Then joyful is the hour, when, to the wretch (Whose feet ne'er wander'd from sequester'd haunts, Who, shut from nature's wond'rous scenery, Breathes but a living spectre), death shall come, Robb'd of his terrors, like a herald gay, To force the frozen gates of bigot zeal, Clos'd by oppression's hand, and barr'd by pride. Ask the pale vestal's meditating soul, Was it for this her rosy infancy Was nurs'd with tender care? Her perfect form, Fashion'd by all the graces and the loves, Rear'd to the op'ning summer of delight, A model of perfection? Was her mind, Stor'd with the prodigality of nature, Expanded, warm'd, enlighten'd, and inspir'd, For this to perish? Can the sable vest, The lawn transparent, or the pendent cross, Deceive th' omniscient! while her beating heart Proclaims her form'd for rational delight? Prepost'rous sacrifice! Sweet fading flow'r! Condemn'd to waste its bloom in one dull speck Of freezing solitude; to lift its head, Lovely as spring! Yet, ere the summer sun Unfolds its od'rous breast,—to droop, and die! 'Mid the grey horrors of his narrow cell, The wasted monk is seen. His silv'ry beard Falls, like Helvetia's snow, half down his breast, Shading his frozen heart. A torpid spell Benumbs life's fountain, while the feeble pulse Marks the slow progress of time's weary course, With languid circulation. Ev'ry clock That sounds the passing hour, appears the knell Which warns him to oblivion. A coarse garb Hangs round his meagre frame; his hollow cheek, Shrivell'd with frequent fasting as with age, Scarce hides his bony jaws. Beneath his cowl, His dimly-gleaming eyes, sunk in their cells, And glaz'd with midnight watching, ask of Heav'n A solitary grave. Poor, breathing ghost! Tell that still questioner, thy weary mind, 'Twas not for cloister'd, visionary glooms, For castigation and sequester'd hours, For cold inanity, life's conscious death, That nature gave thee strength in busy scenes To act a nobler part. Misguided monk! Thou wretched slave of bigotry and fraud! Was it to gabble o'er a canting tale, To trim the wasting lamp, to wear away The flinty pavement with thy wounded knees, To scourge thy meagre flesh, embrace cold saints, To starve thy appetites, till ev'ry bone Shews what a wretched, ghastly thing thou art, Robb'd of thy outward form? Was it for this That reason dawn'd upon thy op'ning youth; And science smil'd, while love, with sportive mein, Danc'd gaily on, leading expectant joys Which told thee thou wert man? O! did the spark, Th' electric spark which kindles fancy's fire, Ne'er in perspective bright unfold such scenes As bade thy bosom glow, ambition warm'd, Or melt in rapt'rous visions? What art thou? Deluded, sad, forgotten! Like a tree Plac'd on a blasted desert, where no sun Visits the sapless trunk, but all around One gloom perpetual reigns. Where are thy pow'rs? Where the perception strong, the active mind, Th' ethereal essence that expands the heart; The depth of knowledge, and the will to act? Where is the stamp which marks th' immortal soul, And places thee above the growling brute? Shrouded by superstition, chain'd by fear, Benumb'd by long seclusion from the world; While naught remains, but a lean, wither'd form, Inert, enfeebl'd, useless, and debased! The Indian wild, that roves the pathless steep, Chasing the famish'd wolf, or savage bear, Anticipates the hour when to his hut He drags the bleeding spoil, and shouts, and sings, In social feasting with his untaught tribes; The blazing fire encircled, sheds a glow On the brown cheek, and gilds the gloomy hour Of wint'ry desolation!—O'er his hut, Scoop'd in the snowy ridge or flinty rock, The blast howls horrible, while the gaunt beast, That roves for prey, fills up the sullen pause With yell'd defiance.—On the distant shore The white surge dashes, with a fateful sound, While the wreck'd mariner the slipp'ry steep Climbs desperately bold. List'ning he hears The deaf'ning din of elements combin'd; Where clouds embattled mingle; while beneath Waves roll on waves, curling their tyrant heads In wild fantastic fury. From the cliff The sea-bird screams, while the half-shrouded moon Throws its dim light upon the world below, Frozen and desolate. Yet ev'n there Man is the friend of man! While the rude grasp, The deaf'ning war-hoop, or the uncouth garb, Shews, with fantastic gestures, the caprice Of ever-varying nature. But, for thee, O solitary monk! no cheerful hour Shall mark the summer morn, or deck the wing Of time with sunny lustre! all, yes all, To thee shall seem a blank; a dreadful blank, Veiling the face of nature, while her voice Whispers reproof; reproof that will be heard Ev'n in the cloister's melancholy shade; Till death shall close the tablet of thy fate, Nor leave one friend, to pity or to praise. Explore the dungeon's gloom, where, all alone, The homicide expires; the guilty wretch, Whose hands are steep'd in gore; whose timid soul, The mild and pitying angel, hope, forsakes, While all the demons of despair and hell Howl in his startled ears! His weary hours Have many a season pass'd, since to his cheek The breeze of heav'n gave freshness; since his lip Imbib'd th' ethereal spirit of the morn, Or balmy sleep, the opiate of the mind, Lull'd the sick sense of sorrow. If his brain Snatches a transitory dream of peace; If, wearied by perpetual, painful thought, A short, but broken slumber fills the throne Of tott'ring intellect: sudden and fierce Some shriek appalling, or some spectre dire, Taunts him to waking madness, and again The mental fever rages! Down his cheek The scalding tear rolls fast. His bloodshot eyes Glare motionless and wide, as if their sense Turn'd inward on his soul. His quiv'ring lip, Drain'd of the life-stream by the conscious fiend, Mutters a brief appeal to angry heav'n, Then freezes into death. No friendly hand Closes the beamless eye: no kindred breast Sustains the livid cheek, grief-worn and mark'd With water-fretted channels. His bow'd head, Silver'd by sorrow in the prime and pride Of lusty youth, shews like a goodly tree, Frost-nipp'd and drooping. Wretched homicide! Whom did he kill? The minion of his foe; The sordid Steward, whose infuriate rage Snatch'd from his helpless babes the well-earn'd store Of many a toilsome hour; the pamper'd slave, Whose mind, grown callous by oppression's task, Repell'd compunctuous pity.—Ask thy heart, Divine philanthropist! who rais'd his hand Against the caitiff's life? The caitiff's self! The petty tyrant, who with barb'rous wrongs Propell'd him on to sin. For reason's breast, Arm'd 'gainst oppression, in resistance strong, Can combat giant fierceness; and tho' oft By subtle malice vanquish'd or betray'd, Still owns the plea of nature! In his low cell The patient child of persecution sits, Pensively sad. His uncomplaining tongue, His stedfast eye, his lean and pallid cheek, Grac'd with the stamp of dignified disdain, Wait the approach of death. No haggard glance Ruffles the placid orb, whose lustre, dimm'd By dungeon vapours, like a dewy star, Gleams 'midst surrounding darkness. On his lip Smiles innocence, enthron'd in modest pride, And eloquently silent! On his breast His folded arms (shielding his guiltless heart From the damp poisons of a living grave), Are firmly interwoven; while his soul, Calm as the martyr at the kindling pyre, Holds strong with resignation. Who will now Breathe the contagious mischiefs of his cell? Who quit the gorgeous splendours of the sun, To watch with him the slowly-wasting lamp, Dim with obtrusive vapours? Who will share The bread of misery, and with the breath Of sympathy more palatable make The cup of human sorrow? Who resign The midnight revelry of happier scenes, Turn from the banquet and illumin'd hall, The throne of flaunting beauty, gaily deck'd, The costly shews of life, to count with him The silent hours of anguish? Tell, O truth! Thou heav'n-descended judge! what has he done? Has he refus'd to bend the flexile knee Before the blood-stain'd foot of ruthless pow'r? To fawn upon the bloated, lordly fool, Who claim'd his vassalage? Has he refus'd To load the groaning altars of the church; Libell'd, by truth, some wanton, courtly dame; Or, like an arrogant, rebellious knave, Dar'd talk of freedom? Say, O vengeful man! Are these thy destin'd victims? Is it thus Thou deal'st the meed of justice? Dost thou think Thy petty rage will sever them from him, Whose attribute is mercy, and whose grace Mocks all distinctions? O! let nature speak, And with instinctive force inform thy soul, That liberty, the choicest boon of heav'n, Is reason's birth-right, and the gift of God! In the worst den of human misery, Behold the hopeless and forsaken wretch, Who on the humid pavement naked lies, Tearing his burning flesh! Then ask thy heart, O! little greatness! and let nature's voice, Piercing the adamantine shield of pride, Tell thee, thy victim is thy fellow man! Once nature's darling, now a maniac wild! His intellectual treasures scatter'd wide, By persecution's strong and ruthless arm, While he, an atom, shrinking from the storm, Flies to an unbless'd grave! Was it for this His youth was pass'd in toil—in mental toil— The hardest labour? Did the classic fount, Such as Athenian sages taught to flow, For him diffuse his renovated streams, The muses bind his brow, the virtues grace His bland, instinctive mind, to bow the slave Of barb'rous ignorance! Did fancy smile, And bid his fingers smite th' Horatian lyre, His pulses throb with the fine fervour, strong; His depth of thought explore the wond'rous page, Which bade Longinus live, himself to die, Unblest, neglected, indigent, and mad? Did he, for this, with Newton climb the spheres, And traverse worlds unknown? Or did the thrill Of heav'n-born poesy, thro' ev'ry vein Dart the electric fire, whose vivid glow Illum'd the darken'd sense of Britain's bard, With full Promethean blaze, while at his touch Immortal themes, embodied, burst to view Angels, and all the mighty hosts of heav'n, Rang'd in tremendous glory? Pow'r supreme! Oh! theme of justice! victims such as these Make reason tremble; rouse the thinking soul, And, in the frenzied agony of wrongs, Present such sceptical and daring thoughts, That man disowns his Maker! Guilty pride, The crime is thine, not his; thy lofty rage, Insulting tyranny, and cold disdain, Pour'd fell oppression's torrent o'er his sense, Madden'd his shrinking brain, and whelm'd his soul! Now anarchy roam'd wide a monster fierce, Of sullen discontent, and rancour born, And nurs'd with blood! Breaking the sacred bonds Of social order, trampling to the dust, Destructions requisite of worth and laws, And dealing desolation all around! Veil'd by its growing wing, the dawning hour, Which welcom'd liberty, and spread around A pure effulgence, suddenly grew dark, And storms impending blacken'd the broad sun. The highmost hills re-echoed with the shouts Of yell'd destruction; while the concave vast Of heav'n shook horrible! The beaten ways, By the unwearied foot of commerce made, Were wash'd with blood: the holy altar stain'd With gore of innocents. The good, the wise, The smiling infant, and the hoary sage, The pride of genius, and the boast of fame, Sunk in the mighty ruin. Rabble rage, And low suspicion, lurk'd beneath the guise Of patriotic ardour. Mem'ry, rous'd By the arch-fiend rebellion, dy'd the steel With fury indiscriminate and wild In the unwary heart. Rebellion then Usurp'd the form of freedom, whose bland soul Shrunk at the boundless and licentious rage Of lawless innovation. 'Midst the scene, Wild as the wintry storm, uprose the lord Of tow'ring desolation!—on his breast, Expanded and omnipotently strong, A gorgon shield shone dazzling, while his arm, Wielding a flaming sword with giant strength, Hew'd down the tree of reason. Then the eye Of shudd'ring liberty was dimm'd with tears, Haggard and grief-swoln. The ensulphur'd air Thicken'd to blot the sun!—The shriek of death Deepen'd the midnight horrors, and the dawn Redden'd thro' tears, while o'er th' ensanguin'd scene Pale nature trembled: for infuriate man, Wild with the fateful plenitude of pow'r, Warr'd 'gainst his desperate fellow. Not alone O'er proud oppression flew the bolts of fate; But all around, as the swift summer storm Tears from the mountain's brow the sturdy oak, While the small flowret and the pois'nous weed Alike are levell'd, so the vengeful shaft Bore down the breathing race: the clang of arms Deafen'd the ear of reason: the loud shout Of uproar, frantic, now was heard to ring The vaulty arch of heav'n, while mingling groans Drown'd the deep sighs of nature! Liberty, Thou rational delight! thou good Ordain'd to bless mankind, how was thy name Profan'd by cruelty! How dimly gleam'd Thy heav'n-illumin'd orbs, beneath a front Blood-stain'd and ghastly! How was thy domain By slaughter desolated, while around, A dread depopulation swept the path Which anarchy had trodden. Where were then Thy fields prolific, and thy hamlets gay, Thy mountain revelries, and peaceful glens, The boast of a brave peasantry? Each hour Mark'd on the page of time some guilty deed, The rav'nous hords wolf-like were gorg'd with blood, While two arch demons, the fierce phalanx led Lawless and cruel! Daring homicides, Apostates to their God! How many fell Beneath the arm, in usurpation strong, Yet recreant in oppression! On the plain The mangled carcase black'ned; rivers bore Their murder'd victims down the blushing wave Of blank oblivion. O'er the flinty way The mutilated limb and streaming heart Met the full eye of pity. Beauty's breast, Polluted by the touch of sensual rage, Quiver'd beneath the fell assassin's sword;— While outrag'd nature stamp'd the hellish deed On retribution's tablet. Ev'ry street Presented the wide scaffold, crimson-stain'd, And menacing destruction. Palaces Were now the haunts of ruthless revellers, Of vices abject, dark conspiracies— While uncurb'd rapine, and blaspheming rage, Rov'd with licentious frenzy. Sacred shrines And temples consecrate, were public marts Of profligate debasement. Not the wise, The virtuous, or the brave, then held the scale Of even justice: freedom's sons inspir'd, In vain rear'd high their banners 'mid the scene Of madd'ning slaughter. For a time their zeal Was mock'd with barb'rous rage; their great design By frenzy violated, or constrain'd By spells infernal. Then, O liberty! Thy frantic mien, and heav'n-imploring eye, Turn'd from the dreadful throng to trace new paths, And seek, in distant climes, new scenes of woe. 'Mid the dread altitudes of dazzling snow O'er-topping the huge imag'ry of nature, Where one eternal winter seem'd to reign, An hermit's threshold, carpeted with moss, Diversified the scene. Above the flakes Of silv'ry snow, full many a modest flow'r Peep'd through its icy veil, and blushing op'd Its variegated hues—the orchis sweet, The bloomy cistus, and the fragrant branch Of glossy myrtle. In the rushy cell The lonely anchoret consum'd his days, Unblessing and unbless'd. In early youth, Cross'd in the fond affections of his soul (For in his soul the purest passions liv'd) By false ambition, from his parent home He, solitary, wander'd: while the maid, Whose peerless beauty won his yielding heart, Condemn'd by lordly, needy persecution, Pin'd in monastic horrors! Near his sill A little cross he rear'd; where prostrate he, At day's pale glimpse, and when the setting sun Tissued the western sky with streamy gold, His orisons wou'd pour, for her whose hours Were wasted in oblivion. Winters past, And summers faded slow, unchearly all To the lone hermit's sorrows. For still, love A mild and unpolluted altar rear'd On the white waste of wonders! From the peak Which mark'd his neighb'ring hut, his tearful eye Oft wander'd o'er the rich expanse below; Oft trac'd the glow of vegetating spring, The full-blown summer splendours, and the hue Of tawny scenes autumnal. Still was he By all forgotten; save by her whose breast Sigh'd in responsive sadness to the gale That swept her prison turrets. Five long years Had the lone hermit turn'd the sandy glass In silent resignation! Five long years Had seen his graces wither, ere his youth Of life was wasted. From the social scenes Of human energy an alien driv'n, He almost had forgot the face of man. No voice had met his ear, save when perchance The pilgrim wanderer, or the goat-herd swain, Bewilder'd in the starless midnight hour, Implor'd the hermit's aid, the hermit's pray'rs; And nothing loth by pity or by pray'r Was he to sooth the wretched. On the top Of his low rushy dome, a tinkling bell Oft told the weary trav'ller to approach Fearless of danger. The small silver sound In quick vibrations echo'd down the glade To the dim valley's quiet, while the breeze Slept on the glassy Leman. Thus he pass'd His melancholy days, an alien man From all the joys of social intercourse, Alone, unpitied;—by the world forgot! His scrip each morning bore the day's repast, Gather'd on summits mingling with the clouds; From whose bleak altitude the eye looks down, While fast the giddy brain is rock'd by fear. Oft would he start from visionary rest, When roaming wolves their midnight chorus howl'd; Or blasts tremendous shatter'd the white cliffs, While the huge fragments, rifted by the storm, Plung'd to the dell below! Oft would he sit, In silent sadness, on the jutting block Of snow-encrusted ice, and shudd'ring mark, 'Mid the vast wonders of the frozen world, Dissolving pyramids, and threat'ning peaks, Hang o'er his hovel, terribly sublime! And oft, when summer breath'd its fragrant gales, Light sweeping o'er the wastes of printless dew, Or twilight gossamer, his pensive gaze Trac'd the swift storm advancing, whose broad wing Blacken'd the rushy dome of his low hut; While the pale lightning smote the pathless top Of tow'ring Cenis,—scatt'ring, high and wide, A mist of fleecy snow. Then would he hear, While mem'ry brought to view his happier days, The trembling torrent, bursting wildly forth From its thaw'd cavern, sweep the shaggy cliff, Vast and stupendous! strength'ning as it fell, And delving, 'mid the snow, a chasm rude. One dreary night, when winter's icy breath Half petrify'd the world; when not a star Gleam'd thro' the blank infinity of space; Sudden the hermit started from his couch, Fear-struck and trembling! ev'ry limb was shook With painful agitation. On his cheek The blanch interpreter of horror wild Sat terribly impressive! In his breast The purple fount of life convulsive throbb'd, And his broad eyes, fix'd motionless as death, Gaz'd vacantly aghast! his feeble lamp Was wasting rapidly! the biting gale Pierc'd the thin texture of his narrow cell; And silence seem'd to mark the dreary hour With tenfold horrors! As he list'ning sat, The cold drops pacing down his hollow cheek, A groan, a second groan, assail'd his ear, And rous'd him into action. To the sill Of his low entrance he rush'd forth, and soon The wicker bolt unfasten'd. The keen blast His quiv'ring lamp extinguish'd, and again His soul was thrill'd with terror. From below A stream of light shot forth, diffusing round A partial view of trackless solitudes; While mingling voices seem'd, with busy hum, To break the spell of silence! Down the steep The hermit hasten'd; when a shriek of death Re-echo'd to the valley! As he flew, Half hoping, half despairing, to the scene Of wonder-waking anguish, suddenly The torches were extinct,—and glooms opake Involv'd the face of nature. All below Was wrapp'd in darkness; while the hollow moan Of cavern'd winds, with melancholy sound, Deepen'd the midnight horrors. Four long hours The hermit watch'd and pray'd. And now the dawn Broke on the eastern summits; the blue light Shed its cold lustre on the colder brows Of Alpine mountains; while the dewy wing Of weeping twilight sweep'd the naked plains Of the Lombardian landscape. On the snow, Dappled with ruby drops, a track was made By steps precipitate; a rugged path Down the steep frozen chasm mark'd the fate Of some night traveller, whose bleeding form Had toppled from the summit. Lower still The anchoret descended—till arriv'd At the first ridge of snowy battlements, Where, lifeless—ghastly, paler than the bed On which her cheek repos'd—his darling maid Slept in the arms of death. Frantic and wild He clasps her well-known form, and bathes with tears The lilies of her bosom,—icy cold! Yet beautiful and spotless! Now afar The wond'ring hermit heard the clang of arms Re-echoing from the valley! the white cliffs Trembled, as tho' an earthquake shook their base With terrible concussion! thund'ring peals From warfare's brazen throat proclaim'd th' approach Of conq'ring legions. Onward they extend Their dauntless columns;—shouts of victory With deaf'ning clamours ratify the toils Of ruthless depredators! In the ranks A ruffian met the hermit's startled gaze, Like hell's worst demon! for his murd'rous hands Were smear'd with gore, and on his daring breast A golden cross, suspended, bore the name Of his soul's darling!—Hapless anchoret! Thy vestal saint, by his unhallow'd rage Torn from monastic solitude, had been The victim of rude rioters, whose souls Had mock'd the touch of pity! To his cell The wretched alien turn'd his trembling feet; And, after three sad weeks of pain and pray'r, Clos'd the dark tablet of his fate—and died! Hail'd by the breathing race, O child of time, Borne on thy parent's wings, thy eagle eyes Glanc'd o'er the pendent world! Full many a spot Seem'd dark with misery; and many a wretch Pin'd in oppression's chain. Italia's sons, Plac'd in the blooming garden of the world, A second Athens, Europe's proudest clime, Pregnant with spicy gales, and balmy dews, Whose seminaries, rich with treasur'd lore, Mark'd that emporeum, where the classic mind Gave and receiv'd the pure exchange of thought; E'en there the sun of intellect was dimm'd By gloomy tyranny. There mis'ry's race, Dark in the centre of expanding light, Still groan'd beneath the worst of slavery, The spells of superstition. Temples vast, And shrines of massy gold, their prisons were; Replete with galling chains; while daring hands Dealt the decrees of heav'n; and impious tongues Pronounc'd anathemas, to fright mankind. Superstition! more destructive still Than plague or famine, tyranny or war! Thou palsying mischief, thou benumbing foe To all the proudest energies of man! Whence springs thy subtle desolating charm, From pompous pageantry and bigot pride, From mitred canopies, and shrines of gold, And bones of mould'ring monks? Can freezing nights, In cells where cold inanity presides, Cloath'd in religion's meek and sainted guise, Or long-drawn pageantry of empty show, Conceal the trembling soul, from that dread pow'r Which marks th' All-seeing! On Italia's shores, On every plain, on ev'ry mountain top, The voice of nature speaks, in mighty sounds, To bid thee tremble! Then, O! nature, say— Shall rich Italia's bow'rs, her citron shades, Her vales prolific, mountains golden clad, And rivers fring'd with nectar-teeming groves, Re-echo with the mighty song of praise To empyrean space, while shackled still The man of colour dies? Shall torrid suns Shoot downward their hot beams on mis'ry's race, And call forth luxuries to pamper pride, Steep'd in the Ethiop's tears, the Ethiop's blood! Shall the caprice of nature, the deep tint Of sultry climes, the feature varying, Or the uncultur'd mind, endure the scourge Of sordid tyranny, or heap the stores Of his fair fellow man, whose ruddy cheek Knows not the tear of pity; whose white breast Conceals a heart, than adamant more hard, More cruel than the tiger's! Bend thy gaze O! happy offspring of a temper'd clime, On whom the partial hand of nature set The stamp of bloomy tints, proportions fine, Unmixing with the goodly outside shew The mind appropriate; bend thy pitying gaze To Zembla's frozen sphere; where in his hut, Roof'd by the rocky steep, the savage smiles, In conscious freedom smiles, and mocks the storm That howls along the sky. Th' unshackled limb, Cloth'd in the shaggy hide of uncouth bear, Or the fleet mountain elk, bounds o'er the cliff The free-born tenant of the desert wild. The glow of liberty, thro' ev'ry vein Bids sensate streams revolve; the dusky path Of midnight solitudes no terror brings, Because he fears no lord. The prowling wolf, Whose eye-balls redden 'midst the world of gloom, Yells fierce defiance, form'd by nature's law To share the desert's freedom. O'er the sky The despot darkness reigns, in sullen pride, Half the devoted year. His ebon wing O'ershadows the blank space: his chilling breath Benumbs the breast of nature; on his brow, Myriads of stars with lucid lustre gem His boundless diadem! The savage cheek Smiles at the potent spoiler; braves his frown; And while the partial gloom is most opake, Still vaunts the mind unfetter'd! If for these Indulgent nature breaks the bonds of woe, Gilding the deepest solitudes of night With the pure flame of liberty sublime; If for the untaught sons of gelid climes, Health cheers the darkest hour with vig'rous age, Shall the poor African, the passive slave, Born in the bland effulgence of broad day, Cherish'd by torrid splendours, while around The plains prolific teem with honey'd stores Of Afric's burning soil; shall such a wretch Sink prematurely to a grave obscure, No tear to grace his ashes? Or suspire, To wear submission's long and goading chain, To drink the tear, that down his swarthy cheek Flows fast, to moisten his toil-fever'd lip, Parch'd by the noontide blaze? Shall he endure The frequent lash, the agonizing scourge, The day of labour, and the night of pain; Expose his naked limbs to burning gales; Faint in the sun, and wither in the storm; Traverse hot sands, imbibe the morbid breeze, Wing'd with contagion, while his blister'd feet, Scorch'd by the vertical and raging beam, Pour the swift life-stream? Shall his frenzied eyes, Oh! worst of mortal miseries! behold The darling of his soul, his sable love, Selected from the trembling, timid throng By the wan tyrant, whose licentious touch Seals the dark fiat of the slave's despair! Humanity! from thee the suppliant claims The meed of retribution! Thy pure flame Would light the sense opake, and warm the spring Of boundless ecstacy; while nature's laws So violated, plead, immortal-tongu'd, For her dark-fated children; lead them forth From bondage infamous! Bid reason own The dignities of man, whate'er his clime, Estate, or colour. And, O! sacred truth! Tell the proud lords of traffic, that the breast Thrice ebon-tinted, bears a crimson tide, As pure, as clear as Europe's sons can boast. Then, liberty, extend thy thund'ring voice To Afric's scorching climes, o'er seas that bound To bear the blissful tidings, while all earth Shall hail humanity! the child of heav'n! BOOK THE SECOND. Where summer smiles, clad in the golden garb Of sunny splendours! where the tangled vine, Bending with purple clusters, richly glows! Where the brown olive clothes the Sabine hills In tawny veil, repelling the hot breeze, The lab'ring throngs advance. In ev'ry eye, The living ray of waken'd intellect Marks reason's lamp divine! on ev'ry cheek A stranger smile is seen, deep'ning the tint Which southern climes diffuse, with ruddy flush Of conscious ecstacy! The voice, unchain'd, Breathes the pure eloquence of nature's tongue, Mocking the fine-wrought sophistry of schools, The pomp of learning, and the vaunted lore Of metaphysic art. The untaught race, Grown to maturity, yet newly born, Above pedantic lessons, feel the glow Of nature's own philosophy. O! change Transcendent and sublime! Blest as the day That, after a long night of gloom opake, A night of months, which blotting the broad sun, From Scandinavia's deserts, smiling comes, And peering o'er some frozen mountain's top, Illumes the ebon world. On ev'ry plain Where Italy unfolds her treasur'd store Of summer gifts luxurious, tepid dews, And gales impregnated with spicy breath Of buds ambrosial, greet the daring hosts Of conquering France. The brazen cannon's roar Echoing to heav'n's high concave, steals away In sullen, long vibration; while around, O'er ev'ry hill, green copse, and woodland glade, From troublous Tiber to th' Etrurian meads, That skirt the vale where Arno's limpid tide Flashes the silver wave, in dulcet sounds, The music of the tinkling mandolin Calls forth the rustic throng, to feast, and sing, And mingle, wildly gay, in mazy dance. And thou, fair city, rising from the wave, Girt with a lucid zone, thy Parian tow'rs, Proud sea-marks, glitt'ring while the sunny beam Glows o'er the Adriatic; thou, emerg'd From gloomy superstition, far more dread Than ocean's vast and liquid battlements Rock'd by tempestuous winds, when all around The equinoctial blast howls fierce and strong, Braving its tyrant orb; thou, 'mid the deep, Standst like a lofty temple, whose firm base The green main guards triumphant; thy proud sons Hymn the loud song of liberty, new-born; While the white sails of welcome treasuries (From worshipp'd Ganges, or Peruvian hills; From odour-breathing Persia's pearly sands, Wash'd by the Caspian wave,) to greet thy mart, Thronging the pale horizon each new morn, Now swell with gales propitious. Now no more Slaughter steals hoodwink'd thro' the gloomy haunts Of thy wave-circl'd citadel. No lord, From the dark gondola, beholds his slave, Whose trade is murder, deal the deadly wound On his unwary foe; while, by the ray Of holy lamp, the keen stilleto glares, And the pale victim sinking, groans and dies. Time was, and mem'ry sickens to retrace The tablet fraught with wrongs, when seasons roll'd O'er the small hut of lowly industry In dim succession of eternal gloom; Tho' rosy morn upon the eastern cliff Burst wide her silver gates, and scatter'd round A bright ethereal show'r! When nature's breast Unveil'd its fragrance, and its bloomy tints, Spangled by twilight's tears, to weary eyes, Unbless'd with sweet repose! Poor, toil-worn race! The hardy blossoms of a fervid soil;— What was their hapless lot? To sigh, to pant, To scorch and faint, while from the cloudless sky The noon-tide beam shot downward. By their hands The burning ploughshare thro' the Tuscan glebe Pursued its sultry way: the smoking plains, Refresh'd by tepid show'rs, receiv'd the pledge Of future luxury. The tangling vine, Nurs'd by their toil, grew fibrous: the brown rind, Dried by the parching gale, wove close and firm, Guarded the rich and nec'trous distillation. The tendrils twin'd, to ev'ry point minute The od'rous bev'rage stole, till the swoln fruit, Empurpled by the sun, the labourers prest To yield its luscious burthen. Yet, for them Did summer gild the plain? Did autumn glow? Did austral breezes fan the tepid show'r, Scarce whisp'ring as it fell? Did the day's toil Ensure the night's repose?—sweet recompence, That well befits the peasant's guiltless soul! Could they, when down the crimson plains of light The lord of day retir'd, when ev'ry bird, The plumy trav'ller of unbounded space, Claim'd the short hour of rest, could labour's sons Shake from their freckled brows the ev'ning dew, And homeward, blithesomely, return to quaff The honey'd cup of joy? Could they suspire Health's breezy hour; on their own cultur'd plains Reap the full harvest, pen their fleecy store; Or, as the night-mist gather'd o'er the heath, Call home their wand'ring herds?—O! suff'ring Carle! When the rich vintage heap'd the lordly board, Moisten'd the feasted lip, or flashing foam'd Within its crystal prison, amber-dyed; When nectar, thrice distill'd by burning gales, Sated the palate of the pamper'd fool; What were thy poor rewards?—A scanty boon! Dealt out with freezing scorn, or brutal pride; A rushy pillow, and a mountain hut, Whose sides of clay, and tempest-shatter'd roof, Scarce screen'd thy bosom from the wint'ry blast; (The very dogs of princes warmer hous'd!) While the long hour, 'till morning's dawn, stole on In sullen sadness, or in fruitless pray'r! Turn to the marble palaces of pride, The velvet hangings, and the golden shows, That made their tables groan! Behold their feasts Of luscious fruits, and blood-inflaming spice; Their oily syrups of ambrosial flow'rs, Conserves, thrice essenc'd in Phœnician dews, Fit for the sick'ning palate of the wretch By luxury unnerv'd! Beneath his feet, The polish'd pavement must be sprinkled o'er With perfumes of Arabia! From above, The lattic'd roof, with summer flow'rs o'erhung, 'Midst aromatic sweets, shed cooling airs On his feast-fever'd cheek! On ev'ry side, In sumptuous colonnades of Parian stone, Or glitt'ring granite, or the fibrous earth Of rich Sienna's hills; slow-breathing flutes, In dulcet strains, take captive the dull sense Thro' the long hour of feasting; cheating time With enervating bliss! O! contrast infinite! Yet who, amidst the mortal myriads, Most labour'd to embellish nature's plan Of boundless wonders? Who, with ceaseless toil, Dug from the beamless mazes of the earth The boast of varying climes, from Lybia's groves To caves Armenian, guarded by the rocks Of wild Euphrates? Who, but the sons of toil, Enrich'd the sculptur'd dome, reviv'd the arts, Sinking, o'ewhelm'd, amidst the wrecks of time? Look round the lofty palaces of pride, Behold the breathing canvas, wond'rous proof Of imitative pow'r! where human forms, Colours, and space, miraculously rang'd, Drew order out of chaos! where the vast Of bold perception varied hues disclos'd, From the rich foliage of embow'ring woods, To mountains, azure capp'd, scarce visible Amid the dusk of distance. Trace the lines That form the graceful statue, Grecian born From rough-hewn quarries! See the rounding limb, The modest look serene! which marks the nymph Of Medicean fame: pround monument Of heav'n-instructed genius! thou shalt charm When pomp and pride shall mingle in the mass Of undistinguish'd clay, inanimate! That, having borne its hour of busy toil, Shrinks into shapeless nothing! Dreadful thought! To mingle with the cold and senseless earth; In spells of dull inanity to rest; The noblest passions, and the living pow'rs Of intellectual light, the soul's pure lamp, All, all extinguish'd! Tell me, nature's God! Then what is the warm magic that supplies The strong life-loving flame, which fills the breast, Enliv'ning time's slow journey? Liberty! If thou art not the impulse exquisite, Where does it dwell? What else can teach the wretch (Lab'ring with mortal ills, disease and pain, Deep-wounding poverty, presumptuous scorn, High-crested arrogance, affections spurn'd,) To bear the weight of thought, and linger out This weary task of being? Blest with thee, The peasant were as happy as his lord— For nature knows no difference! Summer smiles For the poor cottager, and smiling shews The vegetating scene, diffusing fair And equal portions for the sons of earth! But man, proud man, a bold usurper, takes The law of nature from its destin'd course, And fashions it at pleasure! Hence we trace The gloomy annals of receding time Spotted with gore, and blurr'd by pity's tears, Where genius, virtue, nature's progeny! Mark'd by th' Eternal's hand with ev'ry charm, Have shrunk beneath oppression!—bow'd the neck Before the blood-stain'd shrines of impious fraud, Flouted by fools, the gilded dregs of earth, And forc'd to hide the gushing tear of scorn, Till driv'n to mountain caves, and desert glooms, The godlike wonders fled. The first, sublime, The darling of his race; majestic! grand! With eyes, whose living lustre beam'd afar The blaze of intellect, Promethean-touch'd, And infinitely radiant!— By his side, Beauteous and mild as morn's returning star, The maiden, virtue, mov'd! and who can tell But in some hovel low, whose rushy roof The barren cliff defends from wint'ry storms, The godlike pair, scorning the din of fools, (Ambition's clamour, which the despot death Awhile observes, then, with his iron hand, Locks in eternal silence!) who can tell, But the proud pair, by reason's pow'r sustain'd, Cherish a glorious race? Statesmen and chiefs, Poets, and sage philosophers, whose lore Might rival ancient Greece, and nobly prove The solitude of virtue—wisdom's sons! Thy day begins to dawn! Reason sublime! Thy penetrating eye, no more obscur'd By superstition, politic and shrewd, Beholds, beneath the cowl of whining fraud, Blood-thirsty tyrants! subtle hoodwink'd knaves, Who, 'mid the gloomy labyrinths of time, Have murder'd millions. Heap'd the bigot pile, And bit the brand accurs'd, where martyr'd saints Fed the consuming flame. Who, bound in oaths, Hostile to man, insulting to their God, Wove the thick veil which closely shrouded round Th' infernal Inquisition! Hydra fiend! Whose wide-extended hand and ruthless pow'r, Grasp'd the Peruvian desert, rooting thence The tree of reason, and enforcing zeal Which instinct shunn'd, while ages sanctified A grandly fervid worship! In that cause How many perish'd, while the ensanguin'd hords Of sanctified despoilers, dyed the steel In blood and innocence. Oh! sacred truth! How are thy laws profan'd, when cavils shrewd Warp the instinctive mind, and bend the will To tenets politic: when interest rules The mind's strong energies, and bigot fangs Blur the fair aspect of religion pure To feed ambition's maw; destructive gulf, Yawning, but never, never sated!—Now, no more Shall reason, palsied by licentious pow'r, Pay flexile homage to the lofty fool, The carping minion, or the high-rais'd shrew, While with'ring victims cram the ebon jaws Gf Gallia's fell Bastile. O! dreadful hour! Disastrous to the groaning tribes of earth, And doubly horrible, in sight of heav'n! Trace but the source of ev'ry mortal crime, Of rapine, murder, or the hopeless pang Of that misguided and blaspheming wretch Who disavows his God. Whence do they rise? From what deep hell, than Acheron more dark, More terrible to think of? Ask thy heart, O thou, who blest with giddy fortune's smiles, Canst riot in voluptuous wanton joys, Feed on the banquet prodigally rich, Nursing the embryo mischiefs of disease, Clothe thy gross frame, bloated with idleness, In silk, and gems, and perfumes exquisite, Recline on downy beds, where o'er thy breast, Sated with feasting, hangs the gay festoon Of costly velvet; while, till busy noon, In Doric halls, crouded with motley slaves, The vestibules of pride, the drooping child Of humble virtue waits; 'till his faint form, Struggling with poverty and conscious worth, Is spurn'd indignant, or compell'd to hide, In some lone corner of obscure distress, Those mental treasures, which would make thee poor By fair comparison. Then why is he Forc'd by the tyranny of custom's law, To yield thee homage? Fortune is his foe! He wants that vile contaminating dross, Which gives to falsehood all the grace of truth; To fools respect; to villains empty praise; Buys fawning smiles from sycophants and knaves; Deadens the hand of justice; seals the tongue Of busy admonition, hateful guest To that dull empty dupe, whose ear imbibes The honey'd poison of deceitful tongues, While int'rest holds a mirror to his breast, Which flatters, while it damns him. At his gate The famish'd beggar lies; the lame, the blind, The poor artificer, or vet'ran bold, Whose guiltless age and mutilated limbs Are his proud passports! Dost thou feel for him, Thy brother man, but nobler than thyself, By nature's heraldry? Behold his scars, His silver hairs, scatter'd by ev'ry blast That wings the wintry storm. Does gratitude To him present a portion of that wealth— Which he, by many an hour of fierce exploit, Rescued from foreign foes? Does fancy paint, Amid thy dreams of labour'd respiration, The stormy night, when on the tatter'd shrouds, Drench'd by the pelting show'r, while deaf'ning peals Rung in his startled ears, the seaman stood Braving the dreadful gulf that yawn'd below! Such was the mendicant that haunts thy gate! So were his youthful hours consum'd for thee; When o'er the rocking deck the sulphur'd flash Of desolating war its terrors threw Midst dying groans: while thund'ring peal on peal The brazen tongue of slaughter roar'd revenge, Making heav'n's concave tremble! See that cheek Wither'd by torrid suns, or frozen climes, Bath'd with a silent tear. Beside him stands, With half-retiring step and modest eye, Fraught with the silent eloquence of woe, His mis'ry's only hope, a beauteous girl, Gentle as innocent! Her daily task Is filial piety, attention sweet, That marks th' angelic mind! Her outstretch'd arm Guides the slow footsteps of her drooping sire, Grown blind with age, and wearied out with toil: Yet, 'midst the sombre wilderness of woe, Her voice breeds comfort; and her thrifty hand, When on a bed of straw her parent sleeps, Is turn'd to industry. O! fortune blind! Thou, from whose lap uncounted treasures fall, Strewing the paths of folly and of pride With rich redundancy of nature's stores— Till the pall'd fancy sicken, and the sense Faint with satiety: O! fortune blind! Hadst thou no little hoard for modest worth, No silent nook in the vast space of earth, Where the wrong'd child of poverty might rest, Screen'd from the worst of mortal miseries, The cold contempt of ignorance and pride. How glows the patriot soul, while fancy's dream Anticipates the day when ruthless war Shall cease to desolate! Prophetic hope Beholds the heav'nly vision, bleeding France, When o'er thy blooming vales and tawny hills, Thy pine-clad summits and thy yellow plains, Thy peaceful tribes shall rove. The laughing throng, Link'd in the bonds of social amity, Live for each other. Honesty and mirth, Twin children of the mountain cottagers, Labour and peace, come dancing o'er the heath, Purpled with fragrant flow'rs. Before them fly, Flutt'ring their sunny wings, unshackled loves; And hope, with sparkling eyes, whose humid lids Are fill'd with tears of joy! The breezy hills, Glowing with fruits redundant, seem to snatch The sun-beam's lustre; while exulting health Bounds o'er the topmost summit. The soft dews Spangle her airy vest of gossamer, And bathe her od'rous bosom. On her cheek, Deepen'd by exercise, the orient tint Plays on the dimpled smile, while thro' her veins The temper'd blood its purple channel fills By streams revolving; not with sluggish pace Of glutted feasting, or benumbing sloth, But pure and limpid as the vagrant brook Wand'ring in liquid lapse along the vale, And bright'ning as it wanders. All around Reason and peace, exulting, dance o'er flowers Whose austral fragrance thro' the whisp'ring air Scatter a world of sweets. Then, smiling spring! Thy beauties shall unfold redundantly To strew the paths of peace! Then, summer, thou Shalt wear thy golden stole, with cheek of fire Flush'd by extatic bliss, thy broad clear eye Flaming o'er fields luxuriant! Then shall Fame, led on by smiling commere, drop her tear On valour's grave, while rustic revellers Mark the long hour of autumn's closing day By many a simple tale, as simply told, Of hardy valour; then the spacious hearth, Encircled by the sons of toil, shall blaze, Which thro' the long day fed its embers faint, Lonely and unattended. Then the sound Of boisterous glee shall echo to the roof, While the tir'd lab'rer joins, with half-clos'd eyes, The clam'rous burthen of the uncouth song. Who has not seen the cheerful harvest home! Enliv'ning the scorch'd field, and greeting gay The slow decline of autumn? All around The yellow sheaves, catching the burning beam, Glow golden-lustred; and the trembling stem Of the slim oat, or azure corn-flow'r, Waves on the hedge-rows shady. From the hill The day-breeze softly steals with downward wing, And lightly passes, whisp'ring the soft sounds Which moan the death of summer. Glowing scene, Nature's long holiday! Luxuriant, rich, In her proud progeny, she smiling marks Their graces, now mature, and wonder-fraught! Hail! season exquisite!—and hail, ye sons Of rural toil!—ye blooming daughters!—ye Who, in the lap of hardy labour rear'd, Enjoy the mind unspotted! Up the plain, Or on the sidelong hill, or in the glen, Where the rich farm, or scatter'd hamlet, shews The neighbourhood of peace, ye still are found, A merry and an artless throng, whose souls Beam thro' untutor'd glances. When the dawn Unfolds its sunny lustre, and the dew Silvers the outstretch'd landscape, labour's sons Rise, ever healthful,—ever cheerily, From sweet and soothing rest;—for fev'rish dreams Visit not lowly pallets! All the day They toil in the fierce beams of fervid noon— But toil without repining! The blithe song, Joining the woodland melodies afar, Flings its rude cadence in fantastic sport On echo's airy wing! The pond'rous load Follows the weary team: the narrow lane Bears on its thick-wove hedge the scatter'd corn, Hanging in scanty fragments, which the thorn Purloin'd from the broad waggon. On the plain The freckled gleaner gathers the scant sheaf, And looks, with many a sigh, on the tythe heap Of the proud, pamper'd pastor! To the brook That ripples shallow down the valley's slope, The herds slow measure their unvaried way;— The flocks along the heath are dimly seen By the faint torch of ev'ning, whose red eye Closes in tearful silence. Now the air Is rich in fragrance!—fragrance exquisite! Of new-mown hay, of wild thyme dewy wash'd, And gales ambrosial, which, with cooling breath, Ruffle the lake's grey surface. All around The thin mist rises, and the busy tones Of airy people, borne on viewless wings, Break the short pause of nature. From the plain The rustic throngs come cheerly; their loud din Augments to mingling clamour. Sportive hinds, Happy!—more happy than the Lords ye serve!— How lustily your sons endure the hour Of wintry desolation! and how fair Your blooming daughters greet the op'ning dawn Of love-inspiring spring! Hail! harvest home! To thee, the muse of nature pours the song, By instinct taught to warble; instinct pure, Sacred, and grateful to that pow'r ador'd, Which warms the sensate being, and reveals The soul self-evident!—beyond the dreams Of visionary sceptics! Scene sublime! Where earth presents her golden treasuries; Where balmy breathings whisper to the heart Delights unspeakable! Where seas, and skies, And hills and vallies,—colours, odours, dews, Diversify the work of nature's God! Now turn, my Muse, To Albion's plain prolific; where serene, Temper'd by reason, liberty delights To warm th' enlighten'd mind! Where, since the days When her bold Barons ratified their deed, Freedom has smil'd triumphant and secure. Oh! favoured isle, long may discordant broils Be sever'd from thy shores; may howling war Blow its dread blast far, Albion, far from thee, While thy white ramparts, tow'ring o'er the waves, Shall bid thy foes defiance! Here the hind Enjoys the well-earn'd produce of his toil, And sleeps secure, protected by those laws Form'd for the peasant and the prince alike. Still may thy infants, Albion, instinct taught, Prattle of liberty; the sun-burnt swain, As slow the flaming torch of day retires, Sing the loud strain of freedom and of joy. Still may no wrongs invade his midnight dreams, No guilty wish contaminate his will, To violate the laws: for 'tis the sting Of keen oppression that gives birth to crimes, And brutalizes man. The rav'nous wolf Feeds not upon his kind,—his murd'rous will Being but instinctive. Lions prowl abroad, Famish'd and watchful of the desert path Where the lone traveller passes; on his kind He scorns to batten: none but thinking man Preys on his species, sheds his brother's blood, And while opposing, still oppos'd, derides The pleading tongue of nature. Let the brave Turn to the clay-built hovel of content, Where peace and reason consecrate the toils Which virtue's sons endure. See! at their door No shiv'ring pilgrims wait the murd'rous glance Of scowling superstition. No dark fiend Dashes the frugal cup with terror's gall, Or from the fever'd lip, with churlish hand, Snatches the cooling draught. No bigot wrath Starves the poor sinner into faith; or steals From fainting toil that wholesome nourishment Which nature meant for all, nor mark'd the day Nor hour of recreation. Albion! still May thy brave peasantry indignant turn From priestcraft, ignorance, and bigot fraud, To view in nature's wonders, nature's God! For where can man so proudly contemplate Th' Omniscient's pow'r, as in the tablet vast Of infinite creation? Ev'ry breeze Seems the soft whispering of nature's voice, Fraught with the lore of reason. Ev'ry leaf That flaunts its vernal hue, or eddying falls, Its fibres wither'd by autumnal skies, A moral lesson shews. The rippling rill Prattles with nature's tongue. The ev'ning gale Moans the decline of day: while twilight's tears Fall on the dusky wings of chilling night, Spreading to hide its triumphs. The vast dome Gleams with unnumber'd stars, the prying eyes Of those bright centinels, ethereal borne, That watch the sleep of nature. O'er the main, In ebon car aërial, lightning wing'd, The pealing thunder whirling his vast flight, A short-liv'd fiend, gigantic born, the son Of equinox, rides furious. The freed winds Howl as he passes by. The foamy waste Bounds with convulsive horrors; while the waves Lash the loud-sounding shore. O! nature's God! These are the varied pages of that lore Which reason searches; these the awful spells That seize on all the faculties of man, And bind them to allegiance. For that pow'r Which speaks in mighty thunder, wakes the soul, Breathing in balmy gales; is seen alike In the swift lightning and the ling'ring hue Of ev'ning's purple veil; looks thro' the stars, And whispers 'mid the solitude sublime Of thickening glooms nocturnal: from the east Flames forth his burning eye: the grateful earth Welcomes his glances with her boundless stores, And robes herself in splendours: odours rich, And colours varying, decorate her breast, To greet the Lord of nature: forests wild And oceans multitudinous unfold Their wonders to his gaze! Then why should man Creep like a reptile, fearful to explore The page of human knowledge? Why mistrust The sensate soul, the faculty supreme Which instinct wakens? Reason, pow'r sublime! Accept the strain spontaneous from the Muse, Which nurs'd on Albion's cliffs, delights to sing Of liberty, and thee, her Albion's boast. And tho' no flight sublime shall grace her toil, No classic lore expand her thinking mind, Prophetic inspiration, rapt, shall pour This mystic oracle. The pendent globe Shall greet, with pæans loud, the sacred claim To Britain's sons, by reason ratified; And when the God of nature, “trumpet-tongu'd,” Shall check the fiery steeds that hurl the car Of shouting vict'ry, time shall trace her course On the proud tablet of eternal fame; And nature, tow'ring 'mid the wrecks of war, Shall bless her British shores, which grandly lift Their rocky bulwarks o'er the howling main, Firm and invincible, as Britain's sons, The sons of reason! unappall'd and free! END OF THE SECOND BOOK. A MONODY TO THE MEMORY OF SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. Thus, when thy draughts, O Rafaelle! time invades, And the bold figure from the canvas fades, A rival hand recalls from ev'ry part Some latent graces, equals art with art: Transported we survey the dubious strife, While each fair image starts again to life! BROOME. When resignation, bending from the sky, Steals the fond lingering tear from virtue's eye; When the keen agonies of grief are flown, And reason triumphs on her tranquil throne; The Muse to worth and genius tunes her lyre, While the chords glisten with celestial fire: The Muse, in strains untutor'd, and unsought, Soars on the pinions of enraptur'd thought; While memory to her eagle eye pourtrays The lustrous tablet of a nation's praise; While fame, exulting, spreads her fost'ring wings, And truth spontaneous sweeps the bounding strings! Hark! the full chords in mystic sounds aspire, To swell the chorus of the heavenly choir! Where, to seraphic harps, ethereal borne, The song of patience bids us cease to mourn; Contemns the tear that gems each kindred eye, Calms the quick throb, and checks the frequent sigh! While, 'midst the blaze of pure Promethean light, The meek-ey'd cherub bends to mortal sight! See from her dazzling wing soft essence pour Heaven's sacred balm for mis'ry's darkest hour; When Fate inexorable deals her blow O'er this rude wilderness of human woe, 'Till virtue, pointing out the purer mind, Secures the gem, and leaves the dross behind, Claims the bright spirit from its native clod, And bears it, spotless, to the sight of God! Yet, Reynolds, while the winged minstrels join In all the melodies of sounds divine, Round thy cold image, on its icy bed, Some light illumes the mansion of the dead; An unextinguish'd light, that gilds the gloom Where weeping genius guards her fav'rite's tomb! Brightly it shines where thy pure ashes sleep; And while pale melancholy hides to weep, Fame, with glittering wing, shall fan the fire, To shed new lustre on the Muse's lyre! O, if the graces of pathetic verse Can add one trophy to thy sable hearse; If the soft sympathy of sorrow's strain Can, for a moment, sooth the throb of pain; Can check the drop that steals from mem'ry's eye, Or calm affliction's meek and melting sigh; Where is the Muse? why sleep the tuneful throng, While Britain's Rafaelle claims the grateful song? Ye solemn mourners, who, with footstep slow, Prolong'd the sable line of public woe; Who, fondly crowding round his plumed bier, Gave to his worth th' involuntary tear; Ye children of his school, who oft have hung On the grac'd precepts of his tuneful tongue; Who many an hour in mute attention caught The vivid lustre of his polish'd thought! Ye, who have felt, for ye have taste to feel, The magic influence o'er your senses steal, When eloquently chaste, from wisdom's page, He drew each model for a rising age! Say, is no kind, no grateful tribute due To him, who twin'd immortal wreaths for you? Who, from the dawn of youth, to manhood's prime, Snatch'd hidden beauties from the wings of time; Who gave new lessons to your wond'ring sight, Drawn from the chaos of oblivious night; Where, chain'd by ignorance, in envy's cave, The art he courted from a chilling grave; Where native genius faded, unadmir'd, While emulation's glorious flame expir'd; 'Till Reynolds, braving envy's recreant spell, Dragg'd the huge monster from her thorny cell; Who, shrinking from his mild benignant eye, Subdued, to Stygian darkness fled—to die! Now round the brows of British genius play The broad effulgent beams of mental day! See, native taste the vivid scene imbues With the rich lustre of the rainbow's hues! See, from each pencil varying beauties rise, While the proud canvas glows with mingling dyes: See, fancy gives to every mimic form, New power to fascinate, new grace to charm, While o'er each finish'd, each attractive part, Nature stands wond'ring at the touch of art. O, if philanthropy can boast the pow'r, To sooth affliction's dark and dreary hour; If he, who meekly shunn'd the flatterer's gaze, Whose splendid talents shrunk from venal praise; Who, in retirement's consecrated bow'rs, Strew'd the rough path of life with modest flowers; Or with a fost'ring hand, to genius just, Twin'd his own laurel round each youthful bust; Can bid your grateful bosoms proudly glow With innate praise,—beyond the pomp of woe; Now, true to native worth, assert his claim To the best diadem! the wreath of fame! And thou, contention! fiend, of envy born, Hide in some haunt profane thy mien forlorn; Howl in some flinty cave's impervious gloom, Nor break the sacred silence of the tomb! Go, prey on hearts congenial with thy own, Drink their big tears, and mingle in their groan; Sate thy mean rage upon some idiot's breast, But let the sainted shade of genius rest! Beneath yon lofty dome that props the skies, Low on “the lap of earth” your patron lies: Cold is that hand, that gave the touch divine, Which bade the mimic orbs of reason shine; Clos'd is that eye, which beam'd with living light, That gave the mental soul to mortal sight! For, by the matchless wonders of his art, The outward mien bespoke the hidden heart! Taste, feeling, character, his pencil knew, And truth acknowledg'd e'en what fancy drew! So just to nature every part combin'd, Each feature mark'd the tenour of the mind! 'Twas his, with varying excellence, to show Stern manhood's dignity, and beauty's glow! To paint the perfect form, the witching face, With Guido's softness, and with Titian's grace! The dimpled cherub at the mother's breast, The smile serene, that spoke the parent blest; The poet's vivid thought, that shone divine Through the rich mazes of each finish'd line! The tale that bids the tear of pity flow; The frenzied gaze of petrifying woe; The dying father, fix'd in horror wild O'er the shrunk image of his famish'd child.— Ah! stay, my Muse—nor trace the madd'ning scene, Nor paint the starting eye, the frantic mien: Turn from the picture of distracting woes; Turn from each charm, that beauty's smile bestows; Go, form a wreath, time's temples to adorn, Bedeck'd with many a rose, and many a thorn; Go, bind the hero's brow with deathless bays; Or to calm friendship chaunt the note of praise; Or with a feather, stol'n from fancy's wing, Sweep, with light hand, the gay fantastic string; But leave, oh, leave thy fond lamenting song, The feeble echo of a wond'ring throng!— Canst thou with brighter tints adorn the rose, Where nature's vivid blush divinely glows? Say, canst thou add one ray to heav'n's own light; Or give to Alpine snows a purer white? Canst thou increase the diamond's burning hues, Or to the flow'r a richer scent infuse? Say, canst thou snatch, by sympathy sublime, One kindred bosom from the grasp of time? Ah, no!—then bind with cypress boughs thy lyre, Mute be its chords, and quench'd its sacred fire; For dimly gleam the poet's votive lays, 'Midst the vast splendours of a nation's praise? Yet, blest shall be the Muse, and blest the art, That thrills in dulcet murmurs through the heart; That pictures nature in her fairest form; That bids the torpid soul to rapture warm; That soothes the mind, by sorrow's load oppress'd, And bends, with force supreme, the tyrant's crest. Blest be the mingling tones, whose magic leads Through splendid halls—o'er dew-bespangled meads; The clay-built hut, with rapture to explore, Or round the diadem's proud gems to soar; That quell the force of superstitious rage, And shed new lustre o'er the classic page. Blest poetry! whose witching sounds impart All that can harmonise, or grace the heart; 'Tis thine, with lenient balm, to cure despair, To check the throbbings of unpitied care; To bind with weeping flow'rs the lover's urn; To bid ambition's brightest incense burn! Such are thy attributes! then tune thy lays, To chaunt thy sister art's coëval praise; To painting lift the loud extatic song, Wake with celestial notes the vapid throng; And, as the rapt'rous strains exulting rise On truth's white pinions to th' op'ning skies, Haply, some Rafaelle's spirit hov'ring near, Shall greet the pæan with a grateful tear, And, proud to share the glories of the lay, Shall bear its echoes to the realms of day. There, Reynolds, shalt thou claim the votive line; There, smiling, own the artless picture thine: And though thy form lies mould'ring in the tomb, Immortal genius braves the common doom; Though lost, still honour'd by each feeling heart, That shar'd thy converse, or admir'd thy art: And though thy voice no more can charm the breast, Though thy pure spirit mingles with the blest, Thy sainted ashes shall e'en death defy; For fame, which virtue gives—shall never die. Oh, Britain's darling—nature's fav'rite child, In judgment strong, in manners sweetly mild! Could my fond lay one added wreath bestow, Long as my heart laments, my strain should flow; But, ah! where'er my wand'ring fancy leads, Whether to pine-clad hills, or flow'ry meads; Whether at twilight's calm and pensive hour, I weep, unseen, in some lone ivy'd bower, Or, with high-bounding bosom, haste along, To greet the matin lark's melodious song; Whether in tones forlorn, or themes divine, Still shall the strain, the tuneful strain be thine: For all that nature yields, 'twas thine to trace, Love's sportive smile, and wisdom's sober grace, Fear, rage, relentless vengeance, shrivell'd care, And the worst misery of supreme despair: Then where shall fancy turn, or truth aspire, To catch new subjects for her mournful lyre? Where shall the Muse untrodden paths explore? Where find a theme untry'd by thee before? Vain is her search! thy penetrating skill Fashion'd each scene, obedient to thy will; And stealing every flow'r by nature drest, Left but the thorn of woe, to pierce her breast. High o'er the eastern hill, day's burning eye Darts streams of radiance through the sev'ring sky! The upland mead reflects a vivid glow On the calm bosom of the vale below: Soon flames meridian lustre o'er the scene; The out-stretch'd landscape glows with brighter green; Soft silky blossoms, bath'd in ling'ring dews, Ope their sweet breasts, and blush with deeper hues: But when chill twilight, stealing o'er the west, Spreads her grey mantle on Eve's humid breast; All nature mourns! obtrusive shadows veil The tow'ring mountain, and the lowly dale! While each meek blossom, scarcely wak'd to birth, Hides it shrunk head,—and, weeping, fades to earth! So Reynolds shone! the Phœbus of his day, While art and science own'd his genial ray: And since those orbs that shed celestial light, Are clos'd and faded in impervious night; By the mild precepts of his social hours; By the strong magic of his mental powers; By his meek diffidence, his modest mien; His solid judgment, and his soul serene! Oh, ye! who owe to each the meed of praise, Who shar'd the converse of his blameless days; Who, living, own'd the virtues of his heart, Who mark'd the rising glories of his art; Still guard his fame! and when, to happier skies, Like him ye mourn, each sainted spirit flies! May the fond Muse, to worth and genius true, With equal justice form a wreath for you! SAPPHO AND PHAON: IN A SERIES OF LEGITIMATE SONNETS. FLENDUS AMOR MEUS EST; ELEGEIA FLEBILE CARMEN; NON FACIT AD LACRYMAS BARBITOS ULLA MEAS. Ovid. Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow, And tun'd my heart to elegies of woe. Pope. SONNET INTRODUCTORY. Favour'd by heav'n are those, ordain'd to taste The bliss supreme that kindles fancy's fire; Whose magic fingers sweep the Muse's lyre, In varying cadence, eloquently chaste! Well may the mind, with tuneful numbers grac'd, To fame's immortal attributes aspire, Above the treach'rous spells of low desire, That wound the sense, by vulgar joys debas'd. For thou, blest poesy! with godlike pow'rs To calm the miseries of man, wert giv'n; When passion rends, and hopeless love devours, By mem'ry goaded, and by frenzy driv'n, 'Tis thine to guide him 'midst Elysian bow'rs, And shew his fainting soul—a glimpse of heav'n. SONNET II. High on a rock, coëval with the skies, A temple stands, rear'd by immortal pow'rs To chastity divine! ambrosial flow'rs, Twining round icicles, in columns rise, Mingling with pendent gems of orient dyes! Piercing the air, a golden crescent tow'rs, Veil'd by transparent clouds; while smiling hours Shake from their varying wings—celestial joys! The steps of spotless marble, scatter'd o'er With deathless roses, arm'd with many a thorn, Lead to the altar. On the frozen floor, Studded with tear-drops petrified by scorn, Pale vestals kneel the goddess to adore While love, his arrows broke, retires forlorn. SONNET III. Turn to yon vale beneath, whose tangled shade Excludes the blazing torch of noon-day light, Where sportive fawns, and dimpled loves invite, The bow'r of pleasure opens to the glade: Lull'd by soft flutes, on leaves of violets laid, There witching beauty greets the ravish'd sight, More gentle than the arbitress of night In all her silv'ry panoply array'd! The birds breathe bliss! light zephyrs kiss the ground, Stealing the hyacinth's divine perfume; While from pellucid fountains glitt'ring round, Small tinkling rills bid rival flow'rets bloom! Here, laughing Cupids bathe the bosom's wound; There, tyrant passion finds a glorious tomb! SONNET IV. Why, when I gaze on Phaon's beauteous eyes, Why does each thought in wild disorder stray? Why does each fainting faculty decay, And my chill'd breast in throbbing tumults rise? Mute on the ground my lyre neglected lies, The Muse forgot, and lost the melting lay; My down-cast looks, my faultering lips betray, That stung by hopeless passion,—Sappho dies! Now on a bank of cypress let me rest; Come, tuneful maids, ye pupils of my care, Come, with your dulcet numbers sooth my breast And, as the soft vibrations float on air, Let pity waft my spirit to the blest, To mock the barb'rous triumphs of despair! SONNET V. O! how can love exulting reason quell! How fades each nobler passion from his gaze! E'en fame, that cherishes the poet's lays, That fame ill-fated Sappho lov'd so well. Lost is the wretch, who in his fatal spell Wastes the short summer of delicious days, And from the tranquil path of wisdom strays, In passion's thorny wild forlorn to dwell. O ye! who in that sacred temple smile Where holy innocence resides enshrin'd; Who fear not sorrow, and who know not guile, Each thought compos'd, and ev'ry wish resign'd; Tempt not the path where pleasure's flowry wile In sweet but, pois'nous fetters, holds the mind. SONNET VI. Is it to love, to fix the tender gaze, To hide the timid blush, and steal away; To shun the busy world, and waste the day In some rude mountain's solitary maze? Is it to chant one name in ceaseless lays, To hear no words that other tongues can say, To watch the pale moon's melancholy ray, To chide in fondness, and in folly praise? Is it to pour th' involuntary sigh, To dream of bliss, and wake new pangs to prove; To talk, in fancy, with the speaking eye, Then start with jealousy, and wildly rove; Is it to loath the light, and wish to die? For these I feel,—and feel that they are love. SONNET VII. Come, reason, come! each nerve rebellious bind, Lull the fierce tempest of my fev'rish soul; Come, with the magic of thy meek control, And check the wayward wand'rings of my mind: Estrang'd from thee, no solace can I find; O'er my rapt brain, where pensive visions stole, Now passion reigns and stormy tumults roll: So the smooth sea obeys the furious wind! In vain philosophy unfolds her store, O'erwhelm'd is ev'ry source of pure delight; Dim is the golden page of wisdom's lore; All nature fades before my sick'ning sight: For what bright scene can fancy's eye explore 'Midst dreary labyrinths of mental night? SONNET VIII. Why, through each aching vein, with lazy pace, Thus steals the languid fountain of my heart, While, from its source, each wild convulsive start Tears the scorch'd roses from my burning face? In vain, O Lesbian vales! your charms I trace; Vain is the poet's theme, the sculptor's art; No more the lyre its magic can impart, Though wak'd to sound with more than mortal grace! Go, tuneful maids, go bid my Phaon prove That passion mocks the empty boast of fame; Tell him no joys are sweet, but joys of love, Melting the soul, and thrilling all the frame! Oh! may th' extatic thought his bosom move, And sighs of rapture fan the blush of shame! SONNET IX. Ye, who in alleys green and leafy bow'rs, Sport, the rude children of fantastic birth; Where frolic nymphs, and shaggy tribes of mirth, In clam'rous revels waste the midnight hours; Who, link'd in flaunting bands of mountain flow'rs, Weave your wild mazes o'er the dewy earth, Ere the fierce lord of lustre rushes forth, And o'er the world his beamy radiance pours! Oft has your clanking cymbal's madd'ning strain, Loud ringing through the torch-illumin'd grove, Lur'd my lov'd Phaon from the youthful train, Through rugged dells, o'er craggy rocks to rove; Then how can she his vagrant heart detain, Whose lyre throbs only to the touch of love? SONNET X. Dang'rous to hear is that melodious tongue, And fatal to the sense those murd'rous eyes, Where in a sapphire sheath love's arrow lies, Himself conceal'd the crystal haunts among! Oft o'er that form, enamour'd, have I hung, On that smooth cheek to mark the deep'ning dyes, While from that lip the fragrant breath would rise, That lip, like Cupid's bow, with rubies strung! Still let me gaze upon that polish'd brow, O'er which the golden hair luxuriant plays; So, on the modest lily's leaves of snow The proud sun revels in resplendent rays! Warm as his beams this sensate heart shall glow, Till life's last hour with Phaon's self decays! SONNET XI. O! reason! vaunted sov'reign of the mind! Thou pompous vision with a sounding name! Can'st thou the soul's rebellious passions tame? Can'st thou in spells the vagrant fancy bind? Ah, no! capricious as the wav'ring wind Are sighs of love that dim thy boasted flame; While folly's torch consumes the wreath of fame, And pleasure's hands the sheaves of truth unbind. Press'd by the storms of fate, hope shrinks and dies! Frenzy darts forth in mightiest ills array'd; Around thy throne destructive tumults rise, And hell-fraught jealousies thy rights invade! Then, what art thou, O! idol of the wise? A visionary theme!—a gorgeous shade! SONNET XII. Now, o'er the tesselated pavement strew Fresh saffron, steep'd in essence of the rose, While down yon agate column gently flows A glitt'ring streamlet of ambrosial dew! My Phaon smiles! the rich carnation's hue, On his flush'd cheek in conscious lustre glows, While o'er his breast enamour'd Venus throws Her starry mantle of celestial blue! Breathe soft, ye dulcet flutes, among the trees Where clust'ring boughs with golden citron twine; While slow vibrations, dying on the breeze, Shall sooth his soul with harmony divine! Then let my form his yielding fancy seize, And all his fondest wishes blend with mine. SONNET XIII. Bring, bring, to deck my brow, ye sylvan girls, A roseate wreath; nor for my waving hair The costly band of studded gems prepare, Of sparkling chrysolite or orient pearls: Love o'er my head his canopy unfurls, His purple pinions fan the whisp'ring air; Mocking the golden sandal, rich and rare, Beneath my feet the fragrant woodbine curls. Bring the thin robe, to fold about my breast, White as the downy swan; while round my waist Let leaves of glossy myrtle bind the vest, Not idly gay, but elegantly chaste! Love scorns the nymph in wanton trappings drest; And charms the most conceal'd, are doubly grac'd. SONNET XIV. Come, soft Æolian harp, while zephyr plays Along the meek vibration of thy strings, As twilight's hand her modest mantle brings, Blending with sober grey the western blaze! O! prompt my Phaon's dreams with tend'rest lays, Ere night o'ershade thee with its humid wings, While the lorn philomel his sorrow sings In leafy cradle, red with parting rays! Slow let thy dulcet tones on ether glide; So steals the murmur of the am'rous dove; The mazy legions swarm on ev'ry side, To lulling sounds the sunny people move! Let not the wise their little world deride, The smallest sting can wound the breast of love. SONNET XV. Now round my favour'd grot let roses rise, To strew the bank where Phaon wakes from rest; O! happy buds! to kiss his burning breast, And die beneath the lustre of his eyes! Now let the timbrels echo to the skies, Now damsels sprinkle cassia on his vest, With od'rous wreaths of constant myrtle drest, And flow'rs, deep tinted with the rainbow's dyes! From cups of porphyry let nectar flow, Rich as the perfume of Phœnicia's vine! Now let his dimpling cheek with rapture glow, While round his heart love's mystic fetters twine; And let the Grecian lyre its aid bestow, In songs of triumph to proclaim him mine! SONNET XVI. Delusive hope! more transient than the ray That leads pale twilight to her dusky bed, O'er woodland glen, or breezy mountain's head, Ling'ring to catch the parting sigh of day. Hence, with thy visionary charms, away! Nor o'er my path the flow'rs of fancy spread; Thy airy dreams on peaceful pillows shed, And weave for thoughtless brows a garland gay. Farewell, low vallies; dizzy cliffs, farewell! Small vagrant rills, that murmur as ye flow; Dark bosom'd labyrinth, and thorny dell; The task be mine all pleasures to forego; To hide where meditation loves to dwell, And feed my soul with luxury of woe! SONNET XVII. Love steals unheeded o'er the tranquil mind, As summer breezes fan the sleeping main, Slow through each fibre creeps the subtle pain, 'Till closely round the yielding bosom twin'd. Vain is the hope the magic to unbind, The potent mischief riots in the brain, Grasps ev'ry thought, and burns in ev'ry vein, 'Till in the heart the tyrant lives enshrin'd. Oh! victor strong! bending the vanquish'd frame; Sweet is the thraldom that thou bidst us prove! And sacred is the tear thy victims claim, For blest are those whom sighs of sorrow move! Then, nymphs, beware how ye profane my name, Nor blame my weakness, till like me ye love! SONNET XVIII. Why art thou chang'd? O Phaon! tell me why? Love flies reproach, when passion feels decay; Or, I would paint the raptures of that day, When, in sweet converse, mingling sigh with sigh, I mark'd the graceful languor of thine eye As on a shady bank entranc'd we lay: O! eyes! whose beamy radiance stole away, As stars fade trembling from the burning sky! Why art thou chang'd, dear source of all my woes? Though dark my bosom's tint, through ev'ry vein A ruby tide of purest lustre flows, Warm'd by thy love, or chill'd by thy disdain; And yet no bliss this sensate being knows; Ah! why is rapture so allied to pain? SONNET XIX. Farewell, ye coral caves, ye pearly sands, Ye waving woods that crown yon lofty steep; Farewell, ye Nereïdes of the glitt'ring deep, Ye mountain tribes, ye fawns, ye sylvan bands; On the bleak rock your frantic minstrel stands, Each task forgot, save that, to sigh and weep: In vain the strings her burning fingers sweep, No more her touch the Grecian lyre commands! In Circe's cave my faithless Phaon's laid, Her demons dress his brow with opiate flow'rs; Or, loit'ring in the brown pomegranate shade, Beguile with am'rous strains the fateful hours; While Sappho's lips, to paly ashes fade, And sorrow's cank'ring worm her heart devours! SONNET XX. Oh! I could toil for thee o'er burning plains; Could smile at poverty's disastrous blow; With thee could wander 'midst a world of snow, Where one long night o'er frozen Scythia reigns. Sever'd from thee, my sick'ning soul disdains The thrilling thought, the blissful dream to know: And can'st thou give my days to endless woe, Requiting sweetest bliss with cureless pains? Away, false fear! nor think capricious fate Would lodge a demon in a form divine! Sooner the dove shall seek a tyger mate, Or the soft snow-drop round the thistle twine; Yet, yet, I dread to hope, nor dare to hate, Too proud to sue! too tender to resign! SONNET XXI. Why do I live to loath the cheerful day, To shun the smiles of fame, and mark the hours On tardy pinions move, while ceaseless show'rs Down my wan cheek in lucid currents stray? My tresses all unbound, nor gems display, Nor scents Arabian! on my path no flow'rs Imbibe the morn's resuscitating pow'rs, For one blank sorrow saddens all my way! As slow the radiant son of reason rose, Through tears my dying parents saw it shine; A brother's frailties swell'd the tide of woes,— And, keener far, maternal griefs were mine! Phaon! if soon these weary eyes shall close, Oh! must that task, that mournful task, be thine? SONNET XXII. Wild is the foaming sea! the surges roar! And nimbly dart the livid lightnings round! On the rent rock the angry waves rebound; Ah me! the less'ning bark is seen no more! Along the margin of the trembling shore, Loud as the blast my frantic cries shall sound, My storm-drench'd limbs the flinty fragments wound, And o'er my bleeding breast the billows pour! Phaon! return! ye winds, O! waft the strain To his swift bark; ye barb'rous waves, forbear! Taunt not the anguish of a lover's brain, Nor feebly emulate the soul's despair! For howling winds, and foaming seas in vain Assail the breast when passion rages there! SONNET XXIII. To Ætna's scorching sands my Phaon flies! False youth! can other charms attractive prove? Say, can Sicilian loves thy passions move, Play round thy heart, and fix thy fickle eyes, While in despair the Lesbian Sappho dies? Has spring for thee a crown of poppies wove, Or dost thou languish in th' Idalian grove, Whose altar kindles, fann'd by lovers' sighs? Ah! think, that while on Ætna's shores you stray, A fire, more fierce than Ætna's, fills my breast; Nor deck Sicilian nymphs with garlands gay, While Sappho's brows with cypress wreaths are drest; Let one kind word my weary woes repay, Or, in eternal slumbers bid them rest. SONNET XXIV. O thou! meek orb! that stealing o'er the dale, Cheer'st with thy modest beams the noon of night! On the smooth lake diffusing silv'ry light, Sublimely still, and beautifully pale! What can thy cool and placid eye avail, Where fierce despair absorbs the mental sight, While inbred glooms the vagrant thoughts invite, To tempt the gulph where howling fiends assail? O, night! all nature owns thy temper'd pow'r; Thy solemn pause, thy dews, thy pensive beam; Thy sweet breath whisp'ring in the moonlight bow'r, While fainting flow'rets kiss the wand'ring stream! Yet, vain is ev'ry charm! and vain the hour, That brings to madd'ning love, no soothing dream! SONNET XXV. Canst thou forget, O! idol of my soul! Thy Sappho's voice, her form, her dulcet lyre! That melting ev'ry thought to fond desire, Bade sweet delirium o'er thy senses roll? Can'st thou, so soon, renounce the blest control That calm'd with pity's tears love's raging fire, While hope, slow breathing on the trembling wire, In ev'ry note with soft persuasion stole? Oh! sov'reign of my heart! return! return! For me no spring appears, no summers bloom, No sun-beams glitter, and no altars burn! The mind's dark winter of eternal gloom Shews 'midst the waste a solitary urn, A blighted laurel, and a mould'ring tomb! SONNET XXVI. Where antique woods o'er-hang the mountain's crest, And mid-day glooms in solemn silence lour, Philosophy, go seek a lonely bow'r, And waste life's fervid noon in fancied rest. Go, where the bird of sorrow weaves her nest, Cooing, in sadness sweet, through night's dim hour; Go, cull the dew-drops from each potent flow'r That med'cines to the cold and reas'ning breast! Go, where the brook in liquid lapse steals by, Scarce heard amidst the mingling echoes round, What time, the moon fades slowly down the sky, And slumb'ring zephyrs moan, in caverns bound: Be these thy pleasures, dull philosophy! Nor vaunt the balm to heal a lover's wound. SONNET XXVII. Oh! ye bright stars! that on the ebon fields Of heav'n's vast empire, trembling seem to stand; 'Till rosy morn unlocks her portal bland, Where the proud sun his fiery banner wields! To flames, less fierce than mine, your lustre yields, And pow'rs more strong my countless tears command; Love strikes the feeling heart with ruthless hand, And only spares the breast which dulness shields! Since, then, capricious nature but bestows The fine affections of the soul, to prove A keener sense of desolating woes, Far, far from me the empty boast remove; If bliss from coldness, pain from passion flows, Ah! who would wish to feel, or learn to love? SONNET XXVIII. Weak is the sophistry, and vain the art, That whispers patience to the mind's despair! That bids reflection bathe the wounds of care, While hope, with pleasing phantoms, sooths their smart; For mem'ry still, reluctant to depart From the dear spot, once rich in prospects fair, Bids the fond soul enamour'd linger there, And its least charm is grateful to the heart! He never lov'd, who could not muse and sigh, Spangling the sacred turf with frequent tears, Where the small rivulet, that ripples by, Recalls the scenes of past and happier years, When, on its banks, he watch'd the speaking eye, And one sweet smile o'erpaid an age of fears! SONNET XXIX. Farewell, ye tow'ring cedars, in whose shade, Lull'd by the nightingale, I sunk to rest, While spicy breezes hover'd o'er my breast To fan my cheek, in deep'ning tints array'd; While am'rous insects, humming round me, play'd, Each flow'r forsook, of prouder sweets in quest; Of glowing lips, in humid fragrance drest, That mock'd the sunny Hybla's vaunted aid! Farewell, ye limpid rivers! oh! farewell! No more shall Sappho to your grots repair; No more your white waves to her bosom swell, Or your dank weeds entwine her floating hair; As erst, when Venus in her sparry cell Wept, to behold a brighter goddess there! SONNET XXX. O'er the tall cliff that bounds the billowy main, Shad'wing the surge that sweeps the lonely strand, While the thin vapours break along the sand, Day's harbinger unfolds the liquid plain. The rude sea murmurs, mournful as the strain That love-lorn minstrels strike with trembling hand, While from their green beds rise the Syren band With tongues aërial to repeat my pain! The vessel rocks beside the pebbly shore, The foamy curls its gaudy trappings lave; Oh! bark propitious! bear me gently o'er; Breathe soft, ye winds! rise slow, O! swelling wave! Lesbos, these eyes shall meet thy sands no more: I fly, to seek my lover, or my grave! SONNET XXXI. Far o'er the waves my lofty bark shall glide, Love's frequent sighs the flutt'ring sails shall swell, While to my native home I bid farewell, Hope's snowy hand the burnish'd helm shall guide! Tritons shall sport amidst the yielding tide, Myriads of Cupids round the prow shall dwell, And Venus, thron'd within her opal shell, Shall proudly o'er the glitt'ring billows ride! Young dolphins, dashing in the golden spray, Shall with their scaly forms illume the deep, Ting'd with the purple flush of sinking day, Whose flaming wreath shall crown the distant steep; While on the breezy deck soft minstrels play, And songs of love, the lover sooth to sleep! SONNET XXXII. Blest as the Gods! Sicilian maid is he, The youth whose soul thy yielding graces charm; Who bound, O! thraldom sweet! by beauty's arm, In idle dalliance fondly sports with thee! Blest as the Gods! that iv'ry throne to see, Throbbing with transports, tender, timid, warm! While round thy fragrant lips light zephyrs swarm, As op'ning buds attract the wand'ring bee! Yet, short is youthful passion's fervid hour; Soon, shall another clasp the beauteous boy; Soon, shall a rival prove, in that gay bow'r, The pleasing torture of transcendent joy! The bee flies sicken'd from the sweetest flow'r; The lightning's shaft but dazzles to destroy! SONNET XXXIII. I wake! delusive phantoms, hence, away! Tempt not the weakness of a lover's breast! The softest breeze can shake the halcyon's nest, And lightest clouds o'ercast the dawning ray! 'Twas but a vision! Now, the star of day Peers, like a gem o'er Ætna's burning crest! Welcome, ye hills, with golden vintage drest: Sicilian forests brown, and vallies gay! A mournful stranger, from the Lesbian isle, Not strange in loftiest eulogy of song! She who could teach the stoic's cheek to smile, Thaw the cold heart, and chain the wond'ring throng, Can find no balm, love's sorrows to beguile; Ah! sorrows known too soon! and felt too long! SONNET XXXIV. Venus! to thee, the Lesbian Muse shall sing, The song, which Mitylenian youths admir'd, When echo, am'rous of the strain inspir'd, Bade the wild rocks with madd'ning plaudits ring! Attend my pray'r! O! queen of rapture! bring To these fond arms, him who my soul has fir'd; From these fond arms remov'd, yet still desir'd, Though love, exulting, spreads his varying wing! Oh! source of ev'ry joy! of ev'ry care! Blest Venus! goddess of the zone divine! To Phaon's bosom, Phaon's victim bear; So shall her warmest, tend'rest vows be thine! For Venus, Sappho shall a wreath prepare, And love be crown'd, immortal as the Nine! SONNET XXXV. What means the mist opake that veils these eyes; Why does yon threat'ning tempest shroud the day? Why does thy altar, Venus, fade away, And on my breast the dews of horror rise? Phaon is false! be dim, ye orient skies, And let black Erebus succeed your ray; Let clashing thunders roll, and lightnings play; Phaon is false! and hopeless Sappho dies! “Farewell! my Lesbian love,” you might have said, Such sweet remembrance had some pity prov'd; Or coldly thus, “farewell, Oh! Lesbian maid!” No task severe for one so fondly lov'd! The gentle thought had sooth'd my wand'ring shade, From life's dark valley, and its thorns, remov'd! SONNET XXXVI. Lead me, Sicilian maids, to haunted bow'rs, While yon pale moon displays her faintest beams, O'er fading woodlands, and enchanted streams Whose banks infect the breeze with pois'nous flow'rs. Ah! lead me, where the barren mountain tow'rs, Where no sounds echo, but the night-owl's screams; Where some lone spirit of the desert gleams, And lurid horrors wing the fateful hours! Now goaded frenzy grasps my shrinking brain, Her touch absorbs the crystal fount of woe! My blood rolls burning through each bursting vein: Away, lost lyre! unless thou can'st bestow A charm, to lull that agonizing pain, Which those who never lov'd, can never know! SONNET XXXVII. When, in the gloomy mansion of the dead, This with'ring heart, this faded form shall sleep: When these fond eyes at length shall cease to weep, And earth's cold lap receive this fev'rish head; Envy shall turn away, a tear to shed, And time's obliterating pinions sweep The spot, where poets shall their vigils keep, To mourn and wander near my freezing bed! Then, my pale ghost, upon th' Elysian shore, Shall smile, releas'd from ev'ry mortal care; While, doom'd love's victim to repine no more, My breast shall bathe in endless rapture there! Ah! no! my restless shade would still deplore, Nor taste that bliss, which Phaon did not share. SONNET XXXVIII. Oh sigh! thou steal'st, the herald of the breast, The lover's fears, the lover's pangs, to tell; Thou bid'st with timid grace the bosom swell, Cheating the day of joy, the night of rest! Oh! lucid tears! with eloquence confest, Why on my fading cheek unheeded dwell, Meek, as the dew-drops on the flowret's bell By ruthless tempests to the green-sod prest. Fond sigh, be hush'd! congeal, O! slighted tear! Thy feeble pow'rs the busy Fates control! Or if thy crystal streams again appear, Let them, like Lethe's, to oblivion roll: For love the tyrant plays, when hope is near, And she who flies the lover, chains the soul! SONNET XXXIX. On the low margin of a murm'ring stream, As rapt in meditation's arms I lay, Each aching sense in slumbers stole away, While potent fancy form'd a soothing dream; O'er the Leucadian deep, a dazzling beam Shed the bland light of empyrean day! But soon transparent shadows veil'd each ray, While mystic visions sprang athwart the gleam! Now to the heaving gulf they seem'd to bend, And now across the sphery regions glide; Now in mid-air their dulcet voices blend: “Awake! awake!” the restless phalanx cried, “See ocean yawns the lover's woes to end; “Plunge the green wave, and bid thy griefs subside!” SONNET XL. Yes, I will go, where circling whirlwinds rise, Where threat'ning clouds in sable grandeur lour; Where the blast yells, the liquid columns pour, And madd'ning billows combat with the skies! There, while the demon of the tempest flies On growing pinions through the troublous hour, The wild waves gasp impatient to devour, And on the rock the waken'd vulture cries! Oh! dreadful solace to the stormy mind! To me, more pleasing than the valley's rest, The woodland songsters, or the sportive kind, That nip the turf, or prune the painted crest; For in despair alone, the wretched find That unction sweet, which lulls the bleeding breast! SONNET XLI. Oh! can'st thou bear to see this faded frame, Deform'd and mangled by the rocky deep? Wilt thou remember, and forbear to weep, My fatal fondness, and my peerless fame? Soon o'er this heart, now warm with passion's flame, The howling winds and foamy waves shall sweep; Those eyes be ever clos'd in death's cold sleep, And all of Sappho perish, but her name! Yet, if the Fates suspend their barb'rous ire, If days less mournful, Heav'n designs for me! If rocks grow kind, and winds and waves conspire, To bear me softly on the swelling sea; To Phœbus only will I tune my lyre, “What suits with Sappho, Phœbus, suits with thee!” SONNET XLII. While from the dizzy precipice I gaze, The world receding from my pensive eyes, High o'er my head the tyrant eagle flies, Cloth'd in the sinking sun's transcendent blaze! The meek-ey'd moon, 'midst clouds of amber plays, As o'er the purpling plains of light she hies, Till the last stream of living lustre dies, And the cool concave owns her temper'd rays! So shall this glowing, palpitating soul, Welcome returning reason's placid beam, While o'er my breast the waves Lethean roll, To calm rebellious fancy's fev'rish dream; Then shall my lyre disdain love's dread control, And loftier passions prompt the loftier theme! SONNET XLIII. CONCLUSIVE. Here droops the Muse! while from her glowing mind, Celestial sympathy, with humid eye, Bids the light sylph, capricious fancy, fly, Time's restless wings with transient flow'rs to bind! For now, with folded arms and head inclin'd, Reflection pours the deep and frequent sigh, O'er the dark scroll of human destiny, Where gaudy buds and wounding thorns are twin'd. O! sky-born virtue! sacred is thy name! And though mysterious Fate, with frown severe, Oft decorates thy brows with wreaths of fame, Bespangled o'er with sorrow's chilling tear! Yet shalt thou more than mortal raptures claim, The brightest planet of th' eternal sphere! SONNET. TO AMICUS. When the poor exile, who, the live-long night, Mark'd the pale moon-beam trembling on the wave, Doom'd, cold, forlorn, the howling winds to brave, From the bleak mountain spies morn's silv'ry light; Soon he forgets his toilsome journey past, With patient smile descends the rugged steep, And in the valley, shelter'd from the blast, Looks gaily forward, and forgets to weep! So the sad trav'ller, in this world of care, Led through the mazy labyrinths of pain; Sooth'd by false vows, and chill'd by cold disdain, By turns, the slave of hope and dark despair; Still finds the balm, his anguish to beguile, In truth's unerring voice, and friendship's temper'd smile. SONNET. TO INDEPENDENCE. Supreme, enchanting pow'r! from whose blest source The human mind receives its purest joys, 'Tis thine to check oppression's baneful course, And smile indignant on ambition's toys! Thy calm and open eye alike disdains The tyrant's threat, and the smooth flatt'rer's art; The wealthy sycophant, in gilded chains, Or the fair mask, that hides the recreant heart. O nymph ador'd! still let my bosom share Thy conscious joys, thy ecstasies divine! Let tinsel glories deck the brow of care; Content and independence shall be mine! So will I shun the base and little crowd, Pitying the servile slaves—unpitied by the proud! SONNET. [Where, thro' the starry curtains of the night] Where, thro' the starry curtains of the night, Soft whisp'ring breezes wake the ruddy morn, Whose sparkling eye darts forth returning light, Whose golden brows refulgent beams adorn: Where gaudy blossoms o'er the tufted vale, Fling their soft breathings on the spicy gale, From the lorn nightingale on yonder spray, In melting murmurs steals the love-fraught lay; Stranger to joy, and hopeless of relief, At morn's proud glow, and twilight's pensive hour, Her widow'd breast its plaintive song shall pour, In all the luxury of tender grief: For ah! nor morn, nor fragrant gales can move The faithful heart, that mourns a truant love. SONNET. TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER. When Fate in ruthless rage assail'd my breast, And Heaven relentless seal'd the harsh decree; Hope, placid soother of the mind distress'd, To calm my rending sorrows—gave me thee. In all the charms of innocence array'd, 'Tis thine to sprinkle patience on my woes, As from thy voice celestial comfort flows, Glancing bright lustre o'er each dreary shade. Still may thy growing reason's light divine, Illume with joy my melancholy bow'rs; Still may the beams of sacred virtue shine, To deck thy spring of youth with thornless flow'rs: So shall their splendid attributes combine, To shed soft sunshine on my wintry hours. SONNET. [Night's dewy orb, that o'er yon limpid stream] Night's dewy orb, that o'er yon limpid stream Its silent light in soft refulgence throws; Yon limpid stream, whose quiv'ring bosom shows The tender radiance of the silv'ry beam: Yon tangled wood, whose high and waving head Hangs o'er the dashing torrent's frothy source; Which wildly bounding from its pebbly bed, Thro' the lone valley winds its dimpling course; Have oft, full oft, been witness to my woe, When cold neglect, false hopes, and jealous fears, The ruby drops that in my bosom glow, With icy touch transform'd to crystal tears; Dear precious gems, still shall your rays impart The brightest lustre of the feeling heart. SONNET. THE PEASANT. Wide o'er the barren plain the bleak wind flies, Sweeps the high mountain's top, and with its breath Swells the curl'd river o'er the plain beneath, Where many a clay-built hut in ruin lies. The hardy peasant in his little cot Lights his small fire, his homely meal prepares; No pamper'd luxury, no splendid cares, Invade the comforts of his humble lot. Born to endure, he labours thro' the day, And when the midnight storm o'erspreads the skies, On a clean pallet peacefully he lies, And sweetly sleeps the lonely hours away; Till at the peep of dawn he wakes to find, Health in his veins, and rapture in his mind. SONNET. TO INGRATITUDE. He that's ungrateful, has no guilt but one; All other crimes may pass for virtues in him. YOUNG. I could have borne affliction's sharpest thorn; The sting of malice—poverty's deep wound; The sneers of vulgar pride, the idiot's scorn; Neglected love, false friendship's treach'rous sound; I could, with patient smile, extract the dart Base calumny had planted in my heart; The fangs of envy, agonizing pain; All, all, nor should my steady soul complain: E'en had relentless fate, with cruel pow'r, Darken'd the sunshine of each youthful day; While from my path she snatch'd each transient flow'r, Not one soft sigh my sorrow should betray; But where ingratitude's fell poisons pour, Hope shrinks subdu'd—and life's best joys decay. SONNET. TO EVENING. Written under a tree in the woods of St. Amand, in Flanders. Sweet balmy hour!—dear to the pensive mind, Oft have I watch'd thy dark and weeping shade, Oft have I hail'd thee in the dewy glade, And dropp'd a tear of sympathy refin'd. When humming bees, hid in their golden bow'rs, Sip the pure nectar of May's blushing rose, Or faint with noon-day toils, their limbs repose, In baths of essence stol'n from sunny flow'rs. Oft do I seek thy shade, dear with'ring tree, Sad emblem of my own disast'rous state; Doom'd in the spring of life, alas! like thee, To fade, and droop beneath the frowns of fate; Like thee, may Heaven to me the meed bestow, To shelter sorrow's child, and sooth the tear of woe. SONNET. THE MARINER. The sea-beat mariner, whose watchful eye Full many a boist'rous night hath wak'd to weep; When the keen blast descending from the sky, Snatch'd his warm tear-drop from the rav'nous deep. Drench'd by the chilling rain, his dreary hour Creeps slowly onward to the dawn of day; Till burning Phœbus, darting thro' the show'r, Warms with his golden beam the frothy spray: With lightning's swiftness he ascends the mast, And cries, “another tedious night is o'er;” He spreads the swelling sail, he sees at last His darling mistress, and his native shore; The restless wand'rer then forgets past pain, Steals a fond kiss, and braves his fate again. SONNET. TO PHILANTHROPY. First blessing frail mortality can know! Philanthropy divine! all-healing pow'r, Wand'ring untir'd to seek the haunts of woe, Where ruthless sorrow lingers to devour; Thou scorn'st the mummery of empty show; Mankind thy kindred! while from pole to pole, They seek the same inevitable goal, Stung by distinctions, that from custom grow. Thou know'st all light is less than mental day, The Ethiop's dusky brow, Circassia's rose, Are but the varying tints of breathing clay! Life's gilded pageant, dazzling as it goes, Stops at the sepulchre, and fades away, To let the beggar and the prince repose. SONNET. [Ye mould'ring walls, where Titian colours glow'd] Written among the Ruins of an ancient Castle in Germany, in the year 1786. Ye mould'ring walls, where Titian colours glow'd, And the soft minstrel's echo charm'd the ear; Alas! how chang'd your dreary haunts appear, The solitary screech-owl's dark abode. Where in yon gothic wall fair forms divine, Tripp'd with light heel, or swam with graceful ease; Now clasping ivy round the columns twine, And loathsome weeds infect the midnight breeze. Those turrets wasting in the northern blast, No more with burnish'd radiance proudly glow, But in small fragments on the pavement cast, Heap the wild ruin on the plain below; Mingling with dust thy mighty roofs are laid: So man, the grandest work of Heav'n, shall fade. SONNET. LAURA TO PETRACH. O solitary wand'rer! whither stray From the smooth path the dimpled pleasures love, From flow'ry meadow, and embow'ring grove, Where hope and fancy smiling, lead the way! To thee, I ween, full tedious seems the day; While lorn and slow the devious path you rove, Sighing soft sorrows on the garland wove By young desire, of blossoms sweetly gay! Oh! blossoms! frail and fading! like the morn Of love's first rapture! beauteous all, and pure, Deep hid beneath your charms lies mis'ry's thorn, To bid the feeling breast a pang endure! Then check thy wand'rings, weary and forlorn, And find in friendship's balm sick passion's cure. SONNET. THE TEAR. Ah! lust'rous gem, bright emblem of the heart, That proudly scorns a borrow'd ray to share: Whose gentle pow'r can break the spells of care, And sooth with lenient balm the keenest smart. Whether from holy friendship's vow profan'd, Or the dire frenzy of unpity'd love; Whether from cherish'd passion unrestrain'd, Or the worst pang the jealous mind can prove: Yet, if sad mem'ry, ling'ring o'er past love, Calls thee, soft trembler, from thy crystal throne, And sternly bids thy pearly incense flow, E'en when the treach'rous phantom, hope, is flown: How fickle are the gifts thy rays impart, At once the balm and poison of the heart! SONNET. [Pale twilight! wrapp'd in melancholy grey] Pale twilight! wrapp'd in melancholy grey, Thee I adore! and all thy shadowy train: Thy tears, that tremble on each blossom'd spray, Thy breezy breath, that skims along the plain, Fanning the bosom of the weary swain, As home he saunters at the close of day, While the hills echo at his thoughtless strain, Of ditty old, or merry roundelay! Where splendour gilds deceit, let pride control: Mine be the low-roof'd cot, and tranquil mind, Where truth, unvarnish'd, calm, and unconfin'd, Shrinks not to scrutinize the conscious soul! Let insects in meridian lustre shine; The cool, the pensive hour of mental bliss be mine! SONNET. [O busy world! since ev'ry passing day] O busy world! since ev'ry passing day Unfolds new scenes of agonizing woe; Say, whither shall the child of mis'ry go? Where seek, mid thorns, one flow'r to deck his way? My stormy hour presents no cheering ray; For me, no summer morn shall proudly glow: Round my chill'd heart the winds of winter blow, While fainting hope but lingers to decay. Oh, barb'rous world! Why from my bleeding breast Bid peace, with all the pure affections, fly? While round my couch, despair, in horrors drest, From my torn heart extorts th' eternal sigh. Bid me, oh! bid thy trembling victim rest, For if he thus must live—'tis heav'n to die! SONNET. TO LIBERTY. Ah! liberty! transcendent and sublime! Born in the mountain's solitary crest; Nature thy nurse! thy sire, exulting time! Truth, the pure inmate of the glowing breast! Oft dost thou wander by the billowy deep, Scatt'ring the sands that bind the level shore; Or, tow'ring, brave the desolating roar, That bids the tyrant tempest lash the steep! 'Tis thine, where sanguinary demons low'r, Amidst the thick'ning host to force thy way; To quell the minions of oppressive pow'r, And crush the vaunting nothings of a day! Still shall the human mind thy name adore! 'Till chaos reigns—and worlds shall be no more! SONNET. [O Gold! thou pois'nous dross, whose subtile pow'r] O Gold! thou pois'nous dross, whose subtile pow'r Can change men's souls, or captive take the will; Thou, whose fell potency can save or kill, Illume or darken life's precarious hour. Thou tipp'st the leaves of fancy's fairest flow'r With glitt'ring drops: it feels the numbing spell Creep through each fibre slow; while ev'ry ill Of sordid mis'ry blossoms to devour. The bland and lustrous morn of mental grace Thy touch contaminates: thy sev'ring force Breaks friendship's charm; bids honour's wreath decay; Tears the pure blush of love from beauty's face; Arms bold oppression in her ruthless course: While the wide groaning world feels thy destructive sway. SONNET. WRITTEN AT SEA, SEPT. 1, 1792. While o'er the waste of waters, loud and deep, I dimly trace the cliffs of Albion's shore; While evening's shadows o'er the ocean sweep, And wild winds whistle, as the billows roar; For the poor, hopeless mariner I weep; For friends far off, and destin'd to deplore; Who on their downy pillows calmly sleep, While he, alas! is doom'd to wake no more! Yet why should fancy others woes reveal? Have I not felt the rudest storms of fate, And prov'd each pang the human heart can feel? Then fortune, I defy thy fiercest hate! Henceforth, each sensate nerve be hard as steel; For where despair resides, reflection comes too late! SONNET. TO AMICUS. When o'er the darken'd globe, the wings of night Sprinkle soft dews, or fan the chilling wind; The solitary lover, hid from sight, On the bleak rock, sits mournfully reclin'd: Fix'd in the spells of melancholy thought, Unmov'd, he hears the waves that dash below; While his fond heart, with dire destruction fraught, Feeds on the misery of ling'ring woe: But when the jocund day, above the hills Lifts its bright crest, the murky shadows fly; Hope's soothing voice his soul with rapture fills, And checks the tear just trembling in his eye. So the lov'd Muse, flies from the vapid throng, Till charm'd, and waken'd, by thy dulcet song! STANZAS. [Tell me, that nature welcomes rosy spring] “Absence lessens small passions, and increases great ones; as the the wind extinguishes tapers, and kindles fires.” Rochefoucault's Moral Maxims. Tell me, that nature welcomes rosy spring; That plenty weaves a garland for her breast; That summer spreads her renovated wing, And smiles, in gay and glowing colours drest; Tell me, that rapture is her handmaid fair; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Tell me, autumnal suns, with fiercer pow'r, Come darting forth, earth's bosom to adorn; That many a whisp'ring gale, and silky flow'r, Welcomes the lustrous glances of the morn; Tell me, that round her flutters fragrant air; But tell me not, that absence cures despair; Tell me, that winter's howling winds, and rain, Strip the thatch'd cot, and scatter ruin wide; That snows thick falling on the cheerless plain, The scenes of pastime and of labour hide; Tell me, that man is but the prey of care; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Tell me that melodies in ev'ry grove Steal to the breast, and charm each throbbing vein, That hope gives swiftness to the wings of love, Averts his dart, and heals his direst pain, And bids blithe youth his softest transports share; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Tell me, that beauty fascinates the heart, And binds each captive sense in thraldom sweet; That genius mocks the sting of envious art; That baseness only cherishes deceit; Tell me, that falsehood candour's mark can wear; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Tell me, that wealth can purchase short-liv'd fame; That pride can trample on meek modest worth; That idiot souls are flatter'd by a name; That guilt is sanction'd by superior birth; Tell me, that vice assumes a semblance fair; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Tell me, that reason comes with sober eye, To wean the soul from life's delusive toys; That dauntless truth, and mild philosophy, Lead in their train unperishable joys; Tell me, that wisdom laughs at taunting care; But tell me not, that absence cures despair! Each scene I've mark'd, and mark'd them all decay; Youth, hope, meek-bosom'd friendship, pleasure, pain; Cold winter's storms, and summer's radiant day; Truth's mental bliss, and folly's low disdain: And though condemn'd each mortal change to share, Still found, that absence could not cure despair! CUPID SLEEPING. INSCRIBED TO GEORGINA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE. Close in a woodbine's tangled shade, The blooming god asleep was laid; His brows with mossy roses crown'd, His golden darts lay scatter'd round; To shade his auburn curled head A purple canopy was spread, Which gently with the breezes play'd, And shed around a soften'd shade. Upon his downy smiling cheek, Adorn'd with many a dimple sleek, Beam'd glowing health, and tender blisses; His coral lips, which teem'd with kisses Moist, glisten'd with ambrosial dew That reach'd the rose's deepest hue; His quiver on a bough was hung, His bow lay carelessly unstrung; His breath mild odour scatter'd round, His eyes an azure fillet bound: On ev'ry side did zephyrs play To fan the sultry beams of day; While the soft tenants of the grove, Attun'd their notes to plaintive love. Thus lay the boy—when Devon's feet Unknowing reach'd the lone retreat; Surpris'd to see the beauteous child Of every dang'rous pow'r beguil'd! Approaching near his mossy bed, Soft whisp'ring to herself she said:— “Thou little imp, whose potent art “Bows low with grief the feeling heart; “Whose thirst insatiate loves to sip “The nectar from the ruby lip; “Whose barb'rous joy is prone to seek “The soft carnation of the cheek; “Now, bid thy tyrant sway farewell, “As thus I break each magic spell.” Snatch'd from the bough, where high it hung, O'er her white shoulder straight she flung The burnish'd quiver, golden dart, And each vain emblem of his art; Borne from his pow'r they now are seen, The attributes of beauty's queen! While love in secret hides his tears; Dian the form of Venus wears! LINES FROM ANGELICA. I wake from dreams of proud delight, Where gorgeous visions blest my sight! Where fancy rear'd Elysian bow'rs, Adorn'd with never-fading flow'rs; While radiant streams of beaming gold Around the distant mountains roll'd! And gossamer on light winds flew, Sweeping the spangled fields of dew; And weaving with a zephyr's hand A net-work o'er the glowing land. The fervent orb, now spreading wide, Shed all around a silv'ry tide; From ev'ry stem, from ev'ry flow'r, Fast fell the soft and brilliant show'r; Till with his flame-expanding eye He trac'd the confines of the sky, While his gold banner, wide unfurl'd, Stream'd glorious o'er the rolling world! O! visions of supreme delight! Why did ye quit my cheated sight? Why did I wake to mark the hour When winter's angry tempests lour? While on the warring whirlwinds fly The fleecy fragments of the sky, The pelting hail, the bleak blast wild, That chills misfortune's shivering child; Where hopeless and forlorn she weeps, Or to the dropping pent-house creeps, To view with many a rending sigh The lordly mansion tow'ring nigh! Where, while the keen blast cuts her breast, The pamper'd cur sleeps warm at rest; While for a famish'd parent's woes The tear of filial virtue flows, There lux'ry spreads profusion wide, To glut the iron breast of pride! Hark! the shrill winds are whistling round! Thy mantle, winter, wraps the ground; In torrents fall thy hoarded tears, Thy thick'ning breath absorbs the spheres; Thy ebon pinions spread dismay— And mock the sun's enfeebled ray! Oh! winter! fly, thou sternest child, That from the mass of chaos wild, 'Mid storms and howling tempests grew, Thy kindred seasons to subdue! Rock'd by the hurricane, or cast Upon the swift wings of the blast; Thy nurse, the boist'rous north, whose hand Bestow'd the petrifying wand, Taught thee, with desolating breath To form the icy chains of death; Till with resistless fury proud, Exulting, pitiless, and loud, Thou bad'st faint nature own thy hour, And smot'st her with a giant's pow'r! Now gliding on revolving years, Thou chill'st the ocean, earth, and spheres! Yet, transient is thy tyrant reign, Ere nature wakes and smiles again; Ere spring leads on the rosy hours, Calls forth her perfumes, tints, and flow'rs; Bids zephyrus unlock the streams, And revel in the fost'ring beams, While round the tow'ring trunk they play, To renovate the shrivell'd spray! Then up the darting shafts of light, The insect myriads bend their flight, And mingling in a mazy throng, With rapture hum their busy song, To greet the proud effulgent ray That deigns to gild their little day! Oh! ye! who nurs'd in mis'ry's breast, Have long forgot the hour of rest! Ye who have trac'd with ceaseless tears The seasons of disastrous years, Behold the gaudy painted fly, The offspring of a sunny sky; And trust that he who gilds its wing With all the rainbow hues of spring; Who gives the lark its plumage gay To skim along the floods of day; Who bids the busy lab'ring ant Foresee the freezing hour of want; Who guides the spider's vital loom To weave th' unwary insect's doom, Will teach the sensate reas'ning mind, To own his pow'r, and bow resign'd! TO HIM WHO LAMENTED SEEING A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WEEP. The tear that falls from Lesbia's eye, Down her soft cheek in pity flows; As ether drops forsake the sky, To cheer the drooping blushing rose! For, like the sun, her eyes diffuse O'er her fair cheek so bright a ray, That tears must fall like heav'nly dews, Lest the twin roses fade away! THE ADMONITION. AFTER THE MANNER OF THE ANCIENT POETS. Lady! 'tis somewhat strange to find You still are pleasing, still are kind, Still gay and lovely, fair and free, To all—but me! Ah! lady! when those azure eyes A knight right loyal would surprise; If you are just, if you can see, You'll turn to me! I first ador'd you in your prime, I follow'd you with restless time; Yet still a thousand charms I see That still please me! Some wou'd declare those eyes were less With speaking lustre taught to bless; Yet temper'd sweetness now I see, More dear to me! Some would those scanty tresses scorn; I think thy brows they best adorn When they no longer wanton free, Except for me! 'Tis true they now are sprinkled o'er With silvery lustre; I adore The placid hue—whose modesty Most charmeth me! They do not, like the golden day, As erst in wild confusion play: Such dazzling fires I hate to see, They sicken me! Thy smooth fair cheek its rosy hue Hath lost; but tho' 'tis gone, I view The tear of sensibility— That witcheth me! Soft airs of tender languishment, And sighs, with tears of discontent, For boys' fond passion's spring may be— But not for me! I cannot jealous fear endure: If wounded much, I seek a cure; I must be lov'd, fair nymph, or free: So answer me? I swear to love you, if you prove Deserving such a lover's love; I swear till death your slave to be: Then list to me! But first my love must be repaid: I cannot see my being fade, And sigh and mourn, unless I see You sigh with me! Think, lady, you are past your prime, And soon will be the slave of time! For time will never constant be, Lady, like me! He changes with the passing hour, He fades to dust the sweetest flow'r; And you again may never see A swain like me! 'Tis autumn, lady! summer's o'er! You will behold a spring no more! Then let your winter moments be Still gay with me! THE WAY TO KEEP HIM. A lover, when he first essays A lady's heart to gain, A thousand tender fears betrays, And talks of jealous pain! All day he sighs, and sighing swears, That love, and hope, and anxious cares, Destroy his peace, his nights molest, And agonize his “feeling breast!” If not believ'd, he ardent pays Obedient homage still! And ev'ry gentle grace displays, To gratify her will! Where'er she goes, he follows there; And if she flies him, he'll pursue; And if she frowns—he'll still adore; And if she scorns—he'll doat the more! Let her another kindly treat, He sighs in hopeless pain; Let her his eyes with coldness meet, And ev'ry glance disdain; Let her avoid him, wayward prone, To favour all, save him alone! Let others see her always glad, But let him find her—ever sad! Thus wou'd you keep a lover still, Unkind and careless prove; For man is humble—treated ill! And coldness fosters love! Spurn him with harshness, and he sighs; Most servile, when most cross'd; Reward with kindness—and he flies! Adore him—and he's lost! IMPROMPTU. Says time to love, “Thou idle boy! “Thy art is now a jest! “Thy raptures only serve to cloy, “And freeze the modern breast.” “True,” replies love, “but why dost thou “This keen reproach bestow? “Since 'tis before thy wing I bow, “Thy scythe has laid me low; “For what so dims the flame of love? “(Since coldness is my crime) “Ah! what can so destructive prove “As thou, oh! chilling time!” TO ARABELLA! (AFTER THE MANNER OF THE ENGLISH POETS.) My love, whene'er those radiant eyes Their sunshine on this planet throw, A thousand arrows love supplies, To fill thy lover's heart with woe! Lady! when from that rosy lip The angry word in haste you speak, My heart is like to sinking ship, And thro' my stormy breast wou'd break; Yet, lady! better thou shou'dst chide, Than I offend thy beauty's pride. Lady, whene'er you deign to smile, Though winter frown, it still is spring! For joy and fancy all the while Are flutt'ring on hope's sunny wing! Then, lady! smile, and let me prove Each hour a summer day of love! Bright eyes! then still your brilliance keep, And lips still glow with ruby red; And time, oh! never hope to sweep With envious wing that golden head; For know! when round my fair you play, That love will turn your scythe away! TASTE AND FASHION. Says fashion to taste, “I am strangely perplex'd, “For nothing to please me you bring; “With whims and with changes for ever I'm vex'd, “And still fancy is wild on the wing! “I've invented all things that caprice can devise, “I have mingled all colours—and still “The leaders of fashion her fancy despise, “And in ridicule, laugh at my skill! “I have dress'd and un-dress'd the fair nymphs of our land, “I've display'd ev'ry charm they possess; “Like their grand-mother Eve, I have led the gay band, “Or like Venus, have taught them to bless.” “And 'tis therefore they scorn you!” cried taste with a smile, “You have left them no charm to display! “When I led the blythe phalanx, I taught them the while, “To be sparing, and decent, and gay! “I told them, that beauty, when seen by all eyes, “Wou'd the proud charm of novelty lose; “And that he is most constant who fearfully sighs, “She the most happy who learns to refuse!” Let the daughters of fashion to truth then give ear Let them hide the fair charms they possess: And tributes of fame at their feet shall appear, And mankind shall their empire confess. IMPROMPTU ON ?. When Myra bloom'd at gay fifteen, Mankind proclaim'd her beauty's queen, And ev'ry heart ador'd her: Now Myra trembles at three-score; The barb'rous sex, alas! no more A single glance afford her! Now slander occupies her hours! And spleen her wither'd form devours, Of “envious fate” complaining! 'Tis thus we see the rose decay, And all its beauties fade away, The thorn alone remaining! FAIRY RHYMES. OBERON'S INVITATION TO TITANIA. Oh! come, my pretty love! and we Will climb the dewy hill together; An acorn shall our goblet be, A rose our couch in sunny weather; Amidst its fragrant leaves we'll lie, List'ning the zephyrs passing by! Come, come, my pretty love, and sip The dew that from each herb is flowing; And let the insects round thy lip With envy hover while 'tis glowing! Beneath a spring-flow'rs bell we'll sing, While southern gales shall fragrance bring. Then haste, my pretty queen, and dress Thy snowy breast with pearls of morning; Thy smiles shall charm, thy voice shall bless, Thy beauty ev'ry grace adorning! By dawn-light o'er the daisied ground We'll sport, while fairies gambol round. Ah! why delay, my pretty love! The sun is sinking in the ocean, The clear green waters slowly move, The weary zephyrs scarce have motion! Soon, soon the gloomy shades of night Will want those eyes of starry light. I've made thee, love, a canopy Of tulips tinted rich—a cluster Of golden cups is waving nigh, Bath'd in the moon-beams' dewy lustre! The softest turf shall be our floor, With twinkling dew-drops spangled o'er! Thy curtains are of insect's wings, With feather-grass festoon'd and corded; And, for their tassels, zephyr brings The thistle's down, in winter hoarded. Thy pillow is of swan-down fair, “Which floats upon the summer air.” Now, Oberon, thy love attends, His heart with doubt and terror swelling; While low his brow with sorrow bends, To mark of love the lonely dwelling! Oh! come! or ere night's shadows fly, The chilling breeze shall bid me die! TITANIA'S ANSWER TO OBERON. In vain, for me, thy gifts display'd, Meet the red eye of smiling morning; I still will court the lonely shade, Alike thy vows and splendours scorning! Inconstant! ev'ry fairy knows Thy love is like the gale that blows! Thy oaths are like the summer flow'rs, No sooner made than quickly faded; Thy home, like April's transient show'rs, Now gay—and now by storms invaded! Thy song is like the vagrant bird, That sweet in ev'ry clime is heard! Thy couch, so fragrant, rich, and gay, Will fade ere love has learnt to sicken; And thou wilt wander far away, While hope declines, by falsehood stricken: And o'er the moonlight dewy space A thousand rivals fear shall trace! False lover! to the shaggy steep Titania flies, from thee and sorrow! There, while, beneath, the waters sleep, From night a sable veil I'll borrow, And on a thorny pillow rest, Beside the bird of pity's nest. Yes, the lorn nightingale shall be My only friend in hopeless anguish; And to the star of ev'ning we Will tell, how faithful love can languish! The owl shall watch us all night long, Hooting the dreary cliffs among! Go! vagrant lover! 'mid the throngs Of fairy rovers seek a dwelling; While I in silence mourn my wrongs, My sighs upon the cold breeze swelling: Go! sport in wanton, idle play, While moonlight scatters mimic day. Go, where the sun its splendour throws Upon the crest of yon tall mountain— Go, drink oblivion to love's woes, Where ev'ning gilds the lucid fountain: Go, where inconstant zephyrs flee— But think, ah! think, no more of me! THE FORTUNE-TELLER. A GYPSY TALE. Lubin and Kate, as gossips tell, Were lovers many a day; Lubin the damsel lov'd so well, That folks pretend to say, The silly, simple, doting lad Was little less than loving mad: A malady not known of late— Among the little-loving great! Kate lik'd the youth; but woman-kind Are sometimes giv'n to range. And oft the giddy sex, we find, (They know not why) When most they promise, soonest change, And still for conquest sigh: So 'twas with Kate; she, ever roving, Was never fix'd, though always loving! Stephen was Lubin's rival; he A rustic libertine was known; And many a blushing, simple she The rogue had left—to sigh alone! Kate car'd but little for the rover, Yet she resolv'd to have her way; For Stephen was the village lover, And women sigh for sov'reign sway: And he, who has been known to ruin,— Is always sought, and always wooing. Stephen had long in secret sigh'd; And Stephen never was deny'd. Now, Lubin was a modest swain, And therefore treated with disdain: For, it is said, in love and war,— The boldest most successful are! Vows were to him but fairy things, Borne on capricious fancy's wings; And promises but phantoms airy, Which falsehood form'd to cheat th' unwary; For still deception was his trade: And though his traffic well was known, Still ev'ry trophy was his own, Which the proud victor, love, display'd. In short, this Stephen was the bane Of ev'ry maid,—and ev'ry swain! Kate had too often play'd the fool, And now, at length, was caught; For she, who had been pleas'd to rule, Was now, poor maiden, taught! And Stephen rul'd with boundless sway, The rustic tyrant of his day. Lubin had giv'n inconstant Kate Ten pounds, to buy her wedding gear: And now, 'tis said, tho' somewhat late, He thought his bargain rather dear. For, lo! the day before the pair Had fix'd the marriage chain to wear, A gypsy gang, a wand'ring set, In a lone wood young Lubin met. All round him press with canting tale, And, in a jargon well design'd To cheat the unsuspecting mind, His list'ning ears assail. Some promis'd riches; others swore He should by women be ador'd; And never sad, and never poor— Live like a squire, or lord; Do what he pleas'd, and ne'er be brought To shame—for what he did, or thought; Seduce men's wives and daughters fair, Spend wealth, while others toil'd in vain. And scoff at honesty, and swear,— And scoff, and trick, and swear again! One roguish girl, with sparkling eyes, To win the handsome Lubin tries: She smil'd, and by her speaking glance, Enthrall'd him in a wond'ring trance. He thought her lovelier far than Kate, And wish'd that she had been his mate; For when the fancy is on wing, Variety's a dangerous thing: And fancy, when she learns to stray, Will seldom keep the beaten way. The gypsy girl, with speaking eyes, Observ'd her pupil's fond surprise; She begg'd that he her hand would cross With sixpence; and that he should know His future scene of gain and loss, His weal and woe.— Lubin complies. And straight he hears “That he had many long, long years; “That he a maid inconstant loves, “Who to another slily roves; “That a dark man his bane will be— “And poison his domestic hours; “While a fair woman, treach'rously, “Will dress his brow—with thorns and flow'rs!” It happen'd, to confirm his care— Stephen was dark,—and Kate was fair! Nay more, that “home his bride would bring “A little, alien, prattling thing “In just six moons!” Poor Lubin hears All that confirms his jealous fears; Perplex'd and frantic, what to do The cheated lover scarcely knew. He flies to Kate, and straight he tells The wonder that in magic dwells! Speaks of the fortune-telling crew, And how all things the vagrants knew. Kate hears; and soon determines, she Will know her future destiny. Swift to the wood she hies, tho' late, To read the tablet of her fate. The moon its crystal beam scarce shew'd Upon the darkly shadow'd road; The hedge-row was the feasting-place Where, round a little blazing wood, The wand'ring, dingy, gabbling race Crowded in merry mood. And now she loiter'd near the scene, Now peep'd the hazel copse between, Fearful that Lubin might be near, The story of her fate to hear.— She saw the feasting circle gay By the stol'n faggot's yellow light; She heard them, as, in sportive play, They cheer'd the sullen gloom of night. Nor was sly Kate by all unseen, Peeping the hazel copse between! And now across the thicket side A tatter'd, skulking youth she spied; He beckon'd her along, and soon, Hid safely from the prying moon, His hand with silver thrice she crosses— “Tell me,” said she, “my gains and losses!” “You gain a fool,” the youth replies, “You lose a lover too.” The false one blushes deep, and sighs, For well the truth she knew! “You gave to Stephen vows; nay more, “You gave him favours rare: “And Lubin is condemn'd to share “What many others shar'd before! “A false, capricious, guilty heart, “Made up of folly, vice, and art, “Which only takes a wedded mate “To brand with shame an husband's fate.” “Hush! hush!” cried Kate, “for heav'n's sake, be “As secret as the grave! “For Lubin means to marry me; “And if you will not me betray, “I for your silence well will pay; “Five pounds this moment you shall have.”— “I will have ten!” the gypsy cries:— The fearful, trembling girl complies. But what was her dismay, to find That Lubin was the gypsy bold, The cunning, fortune-telling hind Who had the artful story told— Who thus was cur'd of jealous pain,— And got his ten pounds back again! Thus fortune pays the lover bold! But, gentle maids, should fate Have any secret yet untold,— Remember simple Kate! POOR MARGUERITE. Swift o'er the wild and dreary waste A nut-brown girl was seen to haste; Wide waving was her unbound hair, And sun-scorch'd was her bosom bare; For summer's noon had shed its beams While she lay wrapp'd in fev'rish dreams; While, on the wither'd hedge-row's side, By turns she slept, by turns she cried, “Ah! where lies hid the balsam sweet, “To heal the wounds of Marguerite?” Dark was her large and sunken eye, Which wildly gaz'd upon the sky; And swiftly down her freckled face The chilling dews began to pace: For she was lorn, and many a day Had, all alone, been doom'd to stray, And many a night her bosom warm Had throbb'd beneath the pelting storm; And still she cried, “the rain falls sweet, “It bathes the wounds of Marguerite.” Her garments were by briars torn, And on them hung full many a thorn; A thistle crown she mutt'ring twin'd, Now darted on,—now look'd behind— And here and there her arm was seen Bleeding the tatter'd folds between; Yet on her breast she oft display'd A faded branch, that breast to shade: For though her senses were astray, She felt the burning beams of day; She felt the wintry blast of night, And smil'd to see the morning light; For then she cried, “I soon shall meet “The plighted love of Marguerite.” Across the waste of printless snow All day the nut-brown girl would go; And when the winter moon had shed Its pale beams on the mountain's head, She on a broomy pillow lay, Singing the lonely hours away; While the cold breath of dawn-light flew Across the fields of glitt'ring dew:— Swift o'er the frozen lake she past, Unmindful of the driving blast, And then she cried, “the air is sweet— “It fans the breast of Marguerite.” The weedy lane she lov'd to tread When stars their twinkling lustre shed; While from the lone and silent cot The watchful cur assail'd her not, Though at the beggar he would fly, And fright the trav'ller passing by: But she, so kind and gentle seem'd, Such sorrow in her dark eyes beam'd, That savage fierceness could not greet With less than love,—poor Marguerite! Oft by the splashy brook she stood, And sung her song to the waving wood; The waving wood, in murmurs low, Fill'd up the pause of weary woe; Oft to the forest tripp'd along, And inly humm'd her frantic song; Oft danc'd mid shadows ev'ning spread Along the whisp'ring willow-bed. And wild was her groan, When she climb'd, alone, The rough rock's side, While the foaming tide Dash'd rudely against the sandy shore, And lightning flash'd amid the thunder's roar. And many a time she chac'd the fly, And mock'd the beetle humming by; And then, with loud fantastic tone, She sang her wild strain, sad—alone. And if a stranger wander'd near, Or paus'd the frantic song to hear, The burthen she would soft repeat, “Who comes to sooth poor Marguerite?” And why did she with sun-burnt breast, So wander, and so scorn to rest? Why did the nut-brown maiden go O'er burning plains and wastes of snow? What bade her fev'rish bosom sigh, And dimm'd her large and hazel eye? What taught her o'er the hills to stray, Fearless by night, and wild by day? What stole the hour of slumber sweet, From the scorch'd brain of Marguerite!” Soon shalt thou know; for see how lorn She climbs the steep of shaggy thorn— Now on the jutting cliff she stands, And clasps her cold and trembling hands;— And now aloud she chaunts her strain, While fiercely roars the troublous main. Now the white breakers curling shew The dread abyss that yawns below, And still she sighs, “the sound is sweet, “It seems to say, poor Marguerite!” “Here will I build a rocky shed, “And here I'll make my sea-weed bed; “Here gather, with unwearied hands, “The orient shells that deck the sands. “And here will I skim o'er the billows so high, “And laugh at the moon and the dark frowning sky; “And the sea-birds, that hover across the wide main, “Shall sweep with their pinions the white bounding plain; “And the shivering sail shall the fierce tempest meet, “Like the storm in the bosom of poor Marguerite! “The setting sun, with golden ray, “Shall warm my breast, and make me gay. “The clamours of the roaring sea “My midnight serenade shall be! “The cliff, that like a tyrant stands “Exulting o'er the wave-lash'd sands, “With its weedy crown, and its flinty crest, “Shall, on its hard bosom, rock me to rest; “And I'll watch for the eagle's unfledg'd brood, “And I'll scatter their nest, and I'll drink their blood; “And under the crag I will kneel and pray, “And silver my robe with the moony ray: “And who shall scorn the lone retreat “Which heav'n has mark'd for Marguerite! “Here did the exil'd Henry stray, “Forc'd from his native land away; “Here, here upon a foreign shore, “His parents, lost, awhile deplore; “Here find, that pity's holy tear “Could not an alien wand'rer cheer: “And now, in fancy, he would view, “Shouting aloud, the rabble crew— “The rabble crew, whose impious hands “Tore asunder nature's bands! “I see him still,—he waves me on! “And now to the dark abyss he's gone— “He calls—I hear his voice so sweet,— “It seems to say—poor Marguerite!” Thus wild she sung! when on the sand She saw her long-lost Henry stand: Pale was his cheek, and on his breast His icy hand he, silent, prest; And now the twilight shadows spread Around the tall cliff's weedy head: Far o'er the main the moon shone bright, She mark'd the quiv'ring stream of light— It danc'd upon the murm'ring wave, It danc'd upon her Henry's grave! It mark'd his visage, deathly pale,— His white shroud floating in the gale; His speaking eyes, his smile so sweet, That won the love—of Marguerite! And now he beckon'd her along The curling moonlight waves among; No footsteps mark'd the slanting sand Where she had seen her Henry stand! She saw him o'er the billows go— She heard the rising breezes blow; She shriek'd aloud! The echoing steep Frown'd darkness on the troubled deep; The moon in cloudy veil was seen, And louder howl'd the night blast keen!— And when the morn in splendour dress'd, Blush'd radiance on the eagle's nest, That radiant blush was doom'd to greet— The lifeless form—of Marguerite! THE CONFESSOR. A SANCTIFIED TALE. When superstition rul'd the land, And priestcraft shackled reason, At Godstow dwelt a goodly band, Grey monks they were, and but to say They were not always giv'n to pray, Would have been construed treason. Yet some did scoff, and some believ'd That sinners were themselves deceiv'd; And taking monks for more than men, They prov'd themselves, nine out of ten, Mere dupes of these old fathers hoary; But read—and mark the story. Near, in a little farm, there liv'd A buxom dame of twenty-three; And by the neighbours 'twas believ'd A very saint was she! Yet, ev'ry week, for some transgression, She went to sigh devout confession. For ev'ry trifle seem'd to make Her self-reproving conscience shake; And conscience, waken'd, 'tis well known, Will never let the soul alone. At Godstow, 'mid the holy band, Old Father Peter held command. And lusty was the pious man, As any of his crafty clan; And rosy was his cheek, and sly The wand'rings of his keen grey eye; Yet all the farmers' wives confess'd The wond'rous pow'r this monk possess'd; Pow'r to rub out the score of sin, Which Satan chalk'd upon his tally; To give fresh licence to begin,— And for new scenes of frolic rally; For abstinence was not his way— He lov'd to live—as well as pray; To prove his gratitude to heav'n By taking freely all its favours,— And keeping his account still even, Still mark'd his best endeavours: That is to say, he took pure ore For benedictions,—and was known, While Plutus op'd his golden store, Not to unlock his own! And often to his cell went he With the gay dame of twenty-three: His cell was sacred, and the fair Well knew, that none could enter there, Who (such was Peter's sage decree) To Paradise ne'er bought a key. It happen'd that this farmer's wife (Call Mistress Twyford—alias Bridget,) Led her poor spouse a weary life— Keeping him in an endless fidget! Yet ev'ry week she sought the cell Where holy Father Peter stay'd, And there did ev'ry secret tell,— And there, at sun-rise, knelt and pray'd. For near there liv'd a civil friend, Than Farmer Twyford somewhat stouter, And he would oft his counsel lend, And pass the wintry hours away In harmless play; But Mistress Bridget was so chaste, So much with pious manners grac'd, That none could doubt her! One night, or rather morn, 'tis said, The wily neighbour chose to roam, And (Farmer Twyford far from home) He thought he might supply his place; And, void of ev'ry spark of grace, Upon his pillow rest his head. The night was cold, and Father Peter Sent his young neighbour to entreat her, That she would make confession free— To him,—his saintly deputy. Now, so it happen'd, to annoy The merry pair, a little boy, The only son of lovely Bridget, And, like his daddy, giv'n to fidget, Enquir'd who this same neighbour was That took the place his father left— A most unworthy, shameless theft,— A sacrilege on marriage laws! The dame was somewhat disconcerted; For, all that she could say or do, The boy his question would renew, Nor from his purpose be diverted. At length, the matter to decide, “'Tis Father Peter,” she replied; “He's come to pray.” The child gave o'er, When a loud thumping at the door Proclaim'd the husband coming! Lo! Where could the wily neighbour go? Where hide his recreant, guilty head— But underneath the farmer's bed?— Now Master Twyford kiss'd his child; And straight the cunning urchin smil'd: “Hush, father! hush! 'tis break of day— “And Father Peter's come to pray! “You must not speak,” the infant cries— “For underneath the bed he lies.” Now Mistress Twyford shriek'd and fainted; And the sly neighbour found, too late, The farmer than his wife less sainted; For with his cudgel he repaid The kindness of his faithless mate, And fiercely on his blows he laid, 'Till her young lover, vanquish'd, swore He'd play the confessor no more! Tho' fraud is ever sure to find Its scorpion in the guilty mind: Yet, pious fraud, the devil's treasure, Is always paid in tenfold measure. EDMUND's WEDDING. By the side of the brook, where the willow is waving, Why sits the wan youth, in his wedding-suit gay! Now sighing so deeply, now franticly raving, Beneath the pale light of the moon's sickly ray? Now he starts, all aghast, and with horror's wild gesture, Cries, “Agnes is coming, I know her white vesture! “See! see! how she beckons me on to the willow, “Where, on the cold turf, she has made our rude pillow! “Sweet girl! yes I know thee! thy cheek's living roses “Are chang'd and grown pale with the touch of despair; “And thy bosom no longer the lily discloses— “For thorns, my poor Agnes, are now planted there! “Thy blue, starry eyes are all dimm'd by dark sorrow; “No more from thy lip can the flow'r fragrance borrow; “For cold does it seem, like the pale light of morning, “And thou smil'st, as in sadness, thy fond lover scorning! “From the red scene of slaughter thy Edmund returning, “Has dress'd himself gaily with May-blooming flow'rs; “His bosom, dear Agnes! still faithfully burning, “While, madly impatient, his eyes beam in showr's! “O! many a time have I thought of thy beauty— “When cannons, loud roaring, taught valour its duty; “And many a time have I sigh'd to behold thee— “When the sulphur of war in its cloudy mist roll'd me! “At the still hour of morn, when the camp was reposing, “I wander'd alone on the wide dewy plain: “And when the gold curtains of ev'ning were closing, “I watch'd the long shadows steal over the main! “Across the wild ocean, half frantic, they bore me, “Unheeding my groans, from thee, Agnes, they tore me; “But, tho' my poor heart might have bled in the battle, “Thy name should have echoed amidst the loud rattle! “When I gaz'd on the field of the dead and the dying— “O Agnes! my fancy still wander'd to thee! “When around my brave comrades in anguish were lying, “I long'd on the death bed of valour to be. “For, sever'd from thee, my sweet girl, the loud thunder, “Which tore the soft fetters of fondness asunder, “Had only one kindness, in mercy, to shew me— “To bid me die bravely, that thou, love, may'st know me!” His arms now are folded, he bows as in sorrow, His tears trickle fast down his wedding-suit gay: “My Agnes will bless me,” he murmurs, “to morrow, “As fresh as the breezes that welcome the day!” Poor youth! know thy Agnes, so lovely and blooming, Stern death has embrac'd, all her beauties entombing! And, pale as her shroud, in the grave she reposes, Her bosom of snow all besprinkled with roses! Her cottage is now in the dark dell decaying, And shatter'd the casements, and clos'd is the door, And the nettle now waves where the wild kid is playing, And the neat little garden with weeds is grown o'er! The owl builds its nest in the thatch, and there, shrieking, (A place all deserted and lonely bespeaking) Salutes the night traveller, wandering near it, And makes his faint heart sicken sadly to hear it. Then, youth, for thy habit, henceforth thou should'st borrow The raven's dark colour, and mourn for thy dear: Thy Agnes for thee would have cherish'd her sorrow, And drest her pale cheek with a lingering tear: For, soon as thy steps to the battle departed, She droop'd, and, poor maiden! she died broken hearted; And the turf that is bound with fresh garlands of roses, Is now the cold bed where her sorrow reposes! The gay and the giddy may revel in pleasure,— May think themselves happy their short summerday; May gaze, with fond transport, on fortune's rich treasure, And, carelessly sporting,—drive sorrow away: But the bosom, where feeling and truth are united, From folly's bright tinsel will turn undelighted— And find, at the grave where thy Agnes is sleeping, That the proudest of hours, is the lone hour of weeping! The youth now approach'd the long branch of the willow, And stripping its leaves, on the turf threw them round: “Here, here, my sweet Agnes! I make my last pillow, “My bed of long slumber shall be the cold ground! “The sun, when it rises above thy low dwelling, “Shall gild the tall spire where my death-toll is knelling; “And when the next twilight its soft tears is shedding, “At thy grave shall the villagers—witness our wedding!” Now over the hills he beheld a group coming, Their arms glitter'd bright, as the sun slowly rose; He heard them their purposes, far distant, humming, And welcom'd the moment that ended his woes!— And now the fierce comrade, unfeeling, espies him, He darts thro' the thicket, in hopes to surprise him; But Edmund, of valour the dauntless defender, Now smiles, while his corporal bids him—“surrender!” Soon, prov'd a deserter, stern justice prevailing, He died! and his spirit to Agnes is fled: The breeze, on the mountain's tall summit now sailing, Fans lightly the dew-drops that spangle their bed! The villagers, thronging around, scatter roses, The grey wing of evening the western sky closes,— And night's sable pall, o'er the landscape extending, Is the mourning of nature! the solemn scene ending! THE ALIEN BOY. 'Twas on a mountain, near the western main, An alien dwelt. A solitary hut Built on a jutting crag, o'erhung with weeds, Mark'd the poor exile's home. Full ten long years The melancholy wretch had liv'd unseen By all, save Henry, a lov'd little son, The partner of his sorrows. On the day When persecution, in the sainted guise Of liberty, spread wide its venom'd pow'r, The brave saint Hubert fled his lordly home, And, with his baby son, the mountain sought. Resolv'd to cherish in his bleeding breast The secret of his birth—Ah! birth too high For his now humbled state!—from infancy He taught him labour's task: he bade him cheer The dreary day of cold adversity By patience and by toil. The summer morn Shone on the pillow of his rushy bed; The noontide sultry hour he fearless past On the shagg'd eminence; while the young kid Skipp'd to the cadence of his minstrelsey. At night young Henry trimm'd the faggot fire, While oft Saint Hubert wove the ample net To snare the finny victim. Oft they sang And talk'd, while sullenly the waves would sound, Dashing the sandy shore. Saint Hubert's eyes Would swim in tears of fondness, mix'd with joy, When he observ'd the op'ning harvest rich Of promis'd intellect, which Henry's soul, Whate'er the subject of their talk, display'd. Oft the bold youth, in question intricate, Would seek to know the story of his birth; Oft ask, who bore him: and with curious skill Enquire, why he, and only one beside, Peopled the desert mountain? Still his sire Was slow of answer, and, in words obscure, Varied the conversation. Still the mind Of Henry ponder'd; for, in their lone hut, A daily journal would Saint Hubert make Of his long banishment: and sometimes speak Of friends forsaken, kindred massacred; Proud mansions, rich domains, and joyous scenes For ever faded,—lost! One winter time, 'Twas on the eve of Christmas, the shrill blast Swept o'er the stormy main; the boiling foam Rose to an altitude so fierce and strong, That their low hovel totter'd. Oft they stole To the rock's margin, and with fearful eyes Mark'd the vex'd deep, as the slow rising moon Gleam'd on the world of waters. 'Twas a scene Would make a stoic shudder! For, amid The wavy mountains, they beheld, alone, A little boat, now scarcely visible; And now not seen at all; or, like a buoy, Bounding, and buffetting, to reach the shore! Now the full moon in crimson lustre shone Upon the outstretch'd ocean. The black clouds Flew swiftly on, the wild blast following, And, as they flew, dimming the angry main With shadows horrible! Still the small boat Struggled amid the waves, a sombre speck Upon the wide domain of howling death! Saint Hubert sigh'd! while Henry's speaking eye Alternately the stormy scene survey'd, And his low hovel's safety. So past on The hour of midnight,—and, since first they knew The solitary scene, no midnight hour E'er seem'd so long and weary. While they stood, Their hands fast link'd together, and their eyes Fix'd on the troublous ocean, suddenly The breakers, bounding on the rocky shore, Left the small wreck; and crawling on the side Of the rude crag,—a human form was seen! And now he climb'd the foam-wash'd precipice, And now the slipp'ry weeds gave way, while he Descended to the sands. The moon rose high— The wild blast paus'd, and the poor shipwreck'd man Look'd round aghast, when on the frowning steep He mark'd the lonely exiles. Now he call'd; But he was feeble, and his voice was lost Amid the din of mingling sounds that rose From the wild scene of clamour. Down the steep Saint Hubert hurried, boldly venturous, Catching the slimy weeds from point to point, And unappall'd by peril. At the foot Of the rude rock, the fainting mariner Seiz'd on his outstretch'd arm, impatient, wild With transport exquisite! But ere they heard The blest exchange of sounds articulate, A furious billow, rolling on the steep, Engulph'd them in oblivion! On the rock Young Henry stood, with palpitating heart, And fear-struck, e'en to madness! Now he call'd, Louder and louder, as the shrill blast blew; But, 'mid the elemental strife of sounds, No human voice gave answer! The clear moon No longer quiver'd on the curling main, But, mist-encircled, shed a blunted light, Enough to shew all things that mov'd around, Dreadful, but indistinctly! The black weeds Wav'd, as the night-blast swept them; and along The rocky shore, the breakers sounding low, Seem'd like the whisp'ring of a million souls Beneath the green-deep mourning. Four long hours The lorn boy listen'd! four long tedious hours Pass'd wearily away, when, in the east, The grey beam coldly glimmer'd. All alone Young Henry stood aghast, his eye wide fix'd; While his dark locks, uplifted by the storm, Uncover'd, met its fury. On his cheek Despair sate terrible! for, 'mid the woes Of poverty and toil, he had not known, Till then, the horror-giving cheerless hour Of total solitude! He spoke—he groan'd, But no responsive voice, no kindred tone, Broke the dread pause: for now the storm had ceas'd, And the bright sun-beams glitter'd on the breast Of the green placid ocean. To his hut The lorn boy hasten'd; there the rushy couch, The pillow still indented, met his gaze, And fix'd his eye in madness.—From that hour A maniac wild the alien boy has been; His garb with sea-weeds fring'd, and his wan cheek, The tablet of his mind, disorder'd, chang'd, Fading, and worn with care. And if, by chance, A sea-beat wand'rer from the outstretch'd main Views the lone exile, and with gen'rous zeal Hastes to the sandy beach, he suddenly Darts 'mid the cavern'd cliffs, and leaves pursuit To track him, where no footsteps but his own Have e'er been known to venture! Yet he lives A melancholy proof, that man may bear All the rude storms of fate, and still suspire By the wide world forgotten! THE GRANNY GREY. Dame Dowson, was a granny grey, Who, three-score years and ten, Had pass'd her busy hours away, In talking of the men! They were her theme, at home, abroad, At wake, and by the winter fire; Whether it froze, or blew, or thaw'd, In sunshine or in shade, her ire Was never calm'd; for still she made Scandal her pleasure—and her trade! A grand-daughter Dame Dowson had— As fair, as fair could be! Lovely enough to make men mad; For on her cheek's soft downy rose Love seem'd in dimples to repose; Her clear blue eyes look'd mildly bright, Like ether drops of liquid light, Or sapphire gems,—which Venus bore, When, for the silver-sanded shore, She left her native sea! Annetta was the damsel's name; A pretty, soft, romantic sound, Such as a lover's heart may wound, And set his fancy in a flame: For had the maid been christen'd Joan, Or Deborah, or Hester,— The little God had coldly prest her, Or let her quite alone! For magic is the silver sound— Which, often, in a name is found! Annetta was belov'd; and she To William gave her vows; For William was as brave a youth As ever claim'd the meed of truth; And, to reward such constancy, Nature that meed allows. But old Dame Dowson could not bear A youth so brave—a maid so fair. The Granny Grey, with maxims grave, Oft to Annetta lessons gave: And still the burthen of the tale Was, “Keep the wicked men away, “For should their wily arts prevail, “You'll surely rue the day!” And credit was to Granny due, The truth she, by experience, knew! Annetta blush'd, and promis'd she Obedient to her will would be. But love, with cunning all his own, Would never let the maid alone: And tho' she dar'd not see her lover, Lest granny should the deed discover, She, for a woman's weapon still, From Cupid's pinion pluck'd a quill; And, with it, prov'd that human art Cannot confine the female heart. At length, an assignation she With William slily made; It was beneath an old oak tree, Whose widely spreading shade The moon's soft beams contriv'd to break For many a village lover's sake. But envy has a lynx's eye; And Granny Dowson cautious went Before, to spoil their merriment, Thinking no creature nigh. Young William came; but at the tree The watchful grandam found! Straight to the village hasten'd he, And summoning his neighbours round, The hedgerow's tangled bows among, Conceal'd the list'ning wond'ring throng. He told them, that for many a night An old grey owl was heard; A fierce, ill-omen'd, crabbed bird— Who fill'd the village with affright. He swore this bird was large and keen, With claws of fire, and eye-balls green; That nothing rested where she came; That many pranks the monster play'd, And many a timid trembling maid She brought to shame, For negligence that was her own: Turning the milk to water clear, And spilling from the cask small-beer; Pinching, like fairies, harmless lasses, And shewing imps in looking-glasses; Or, with heart-piercing groan, Along the church-yard path swift gliding, Or, on a broomstick, witch-like, riding. All listen'd trembling; for the tale Made cheeks of ochre chalky pale; The young a valiant doubt pretended; The old believ'd, and all attended. Now to Dame Dowson he repairs, And in his arms enfolds the granny: Kneels at her feet, and fondly swears He will be true as any! Caresses her with well-feign'd bliss, And, fearfully, implores a kiss;— On the green turf distracted lying, He wastes his ardent breath in sighing. The dame was silent; for the lover Would, when she spoke, She fear'd, discover Her envious joke: And she was too much charm'd to be In haste,—to end the comedy! Now William, weary of such wooing, Began, with all his might, hollooing:— When suddenly from ev'ry bush The eager throngs impatient rush; With shouting, and with boist'rous glee, Dame Dowson they pursue, And from the broad oak's canopy, O'er moonlight fields of sparkling dew, They bear in triumph the old dame, Bawling, with loud huzzas, her name: “A witch, a witch!” the people cry, “A witch!” the echoing hills reply: Till to her home the granny came, Where, to confirm the tale of shame, Each rising day they went, in throngs, With ribald jests, and sportive songs: Till granny of her spleen repented; And to young William's ardent pray'r, To take for life Annetta fair,— At last—consented. And should this tale fall in the way Of lovers cross'd, or grannies grey,— Let them confess, 'tis made to prove— The wisest heads—too weak for love! GOLFRE. A GOTHIC SWISS TALE. IN FIVE PARTS. [PART FIRST] Where freezing wastes of dazzl'ing snow O'er Leman's lake rose tow'ring, The Baron Golfre's castle strong Was seen, the silv'ry peaks among, With ramparts darkly low'ring!— Tall battlements of flint uprose, Long shadowing down the valley, A grove of sombre pine, antique, Amid the white expanse would break, In many a gloomy alley. A strong portcullis entrance show'd, With ivy brown hung over; And stagnate the green moat was found, Whene'er the trav'ller wander'd round, Or moon-enamour'd lover. Within the spacious courts were seen A thousand gothic fancies; Of banners, trophies, armour bright, Of shields thick batter'd in the fight, And interwoven lances. The Baron Golfre long had been To solitude devoted; And oft in pray'r would pass the night, Till day's vermilion stream of light Along the blue hill floated. And yet his pray'r was little mark'd With pure and calm devotion; For oft, upon the pavement bare, He'd dash his limbs, and rend his hair, With terrible emotion! And sometimes he, at midnight hour, Would howl, like wolves wide-prowling; And pale the lamps would glimmer round— And deep the self-mov'd bell would sound, A knell prophetic tolling! For, in the hall, three lamps were seen, That quiver'd dim;—and near them A bell-rope hung, that from the tow'r Three knells would toll at midnight's hour, Startling the soul to hear them! And oft a dreadful crash was heard, Shaking the castle's chambers! And suddenly the lights would turn To pale grey, and dimly burn, Like faint and dying embers. Beneath the steep, a maiden dwelt, The dove-ey'd Zorietto; A damsel bless'd with ev'ry grace— And springing from as old a race, As Lady of Loretto! Her dwelling was a goatherd's poor; Yet she his heart delighted; Their little hovel open stood, Beside a lonesome frowning wood, To travellers—benighted. Yet oft, at midnight, when the moon Its dappled course was steering, The castle bell would break their sleep, And Zorietto slow would creep— To bar the wicket—fearing! What did she fear? O! dreadful thought! The moon's wan lustre streaming; The dim grey lamps, the crashing sound, The lonely bittern—shrieking round The roof,—with pale light gleaming. And often, when the wintry wind Loud whistled o'er their dwelling, They sat beside their faggot fire, While Zorietto's aged sire A dismal tale was telling. He told a long and dismal tale, How a fair lady perish'd; How her sweet baby, doom'd to be The partner of her destiny, Was by a peasant cherish'd! He told a long and dismal tale, How, from a flinty tow'r, A lady wailing sad was seen, The lofty grated bars between, At dawnlight's purple hour! He told a tale of bitter woe, His heart with pity swelling, How the fair lady pin'd and died, And how her ghost, at Christmas-tide— Would wander—near her dwelling. He told her, how a lowly dame The lady, lorn, befriended— Who chang'd her own dear baby, dead, And took the lady's in its stead— And then—“Forgive her, heav'n!” he said; And so his story ended. PART SECOND. As on the rushy floor she sat, Her hand her pale cheek pressing, Oft, on the goatherd's face, her eyes Would fix intent, her mute surprise In frequent starts confessing. Then slowly would she turn her head, And watch the narrow wicket; And shudder, while the wintry blast, In shrilly cadence, swiftly past Along the neighb'ring thicket. One night, it was in winter time, The castle bell was tolling; The air was still, the moon was seen Sporting her starry train between, The thin clouds round her rolling. And now she watch'd the wasting lamp, Her timid bosom panting; And now the crickets faintly sing; And now she hears the raven's wing Sweeping their low roof, slanting. And, as the wicket latch she clos'd, A groan was heard!—she trembled! And now a clashing, steely sound, In quick vibrations, echo'd round, Like murd'rous swords assembled! She started back; she look'd around,— The goatherd swain was sleeping; A stagnate paleness mark'd her cheek, She would have call'd, but could not speak, While through the lattice peeping. And O! how dimly shone the moon Upon the snowy mountain! And fierely did the wild blast blow, And now her tears began to flow, Fast as a falling fountain. And now she heard the castle bell Again toll sad and slowly; She knelt and sigh'd: the lamp burnt pale— She thought upon the dismal tale— And pray'd with fervour holy! And now her little string of beads She kiss'd,—and cross'd her breast; It was a simple rosary, Made of the mountain holly-tree, By sainted fathers blest! And now the wicket open flew, As though a whirl-wind fell'd it; And now a ghastly figure stood Before the maiden—while her blood Congeal'd, as she beheld it! His face was pale, his eyes were wild, His beard was dark; and near him A stream of light was seen to glide, Marking a poniard, crimson-dy'd; The bravest soul might fear him! His forehead was all gash'd and gor'd, His vest was black and flowing, His strong hand grasp'd a dagger keen; And wild and frantic was his mien, Dread signs of terror showing. “O fly me not!” the baron cried, “In heav'n's name, do not fear me!” Just as he spoke, the bell thrice toll'd— Three paly lamps they now behold— While a faint voice, cried—“hear me!” And now, upon the threshold low, The wounded Golfre, kneeling, Again to heav'n address'd his pray'r; The waning moon, with livid glare, Was down the dark sky stealing. They led him in, they bath'd his wounds, Tears to the red stream adding: The haughty Golfre gaz'd, admir'd! The peasant girl his fancy fir'd, And set his senses madding! He prest her hand; she turn'd away, Her blushes deeper glowing, Her cheek still spangled o'er with tears: So the wild rose more fresh appears When the soft dews are flowing! Again the baron fondly gaz'd; Poor Zorietto trembled; And Golfre watch'd her throbbing breast, Which seem'd with weighty woes oppress'd, And softest love dissembled. The goatherd fourscore years had seen, And he was sick and needy; The baron wore a sword of gold, Which poverty might well behold With eyes wide stretch'd and greedy! The dawn arose! the yellow light Around the Alps spread cheering! The baron kiss'd the goatherd's child— “Farewell!” she cried,—and blushing smil'd— No future peril fearing. Now Golfre homeward bent his way, His breast with passion burning: The chapel bell was rung for pray'r, And all—save Golfre, prostrate there— Thank'd heav'n for his returning! PART THIRD. Three times the orient ray was seen Above the east cliff mounting, When Golfre sought the cottage grace, To share the honours of his race, With treasures beyond counting! Th' ev'ning sun was burning red, The twilight veil spread slowly, While Zorietto, near the wood Where long a little cross had stood, Was singing vespers holy. And now she kiss'd her holly-beads, And now she cross'd her breast; The night-dew fell from ev'ry tree— It fell upon her rosary, Like tears of heav'n twice bless'd! She knelt upon the brown moss cold, She knelt, with eyes mild beaming! The day had clos'd, she heard a sigh! She mark'd the clear and frosty sky With starry lustre gleaming. She rose; she heard the draw-bridge chains Loud clanking down the valley; She mark'd the yellow torches shine Between the antique groves of pine, Bright'ning each gloomy alley. And now the breeze began to blow, Soft-stealing up the mountain; It seem'd at first a dulcet sound— Like mingled waters, wand'ring round, Slow falling from a fountain. And now, in wilder tone it rose, The white peaks sweeping shrilly: It play'd amidst her golden hair, It kiss'd her bosom cold and fair, And sweet as vale-born lily! She heard the hollow tread of feet Thridding the piny cluster; The torches flam'd before the wind; And many a spark was left behind, To mock the glow-worm's lustre. She saw them guard the cottage door, Her heart beat high with wonder! She heard the fierce and northern blast, As o'er the topmost point it past, Like peals of bursting thunder! And now she hied her swift along, And reach'd the guarded wicket; But O! what terror fill'd her soul, When thrice she heard the deep bell toll, Above the gloomy thicket. Now fierce the baron darted forth, His trembling victim seizing; She felt her blood in ev'ry vein Move with a sense of dead'ning pain, As though her heart were freezing. “This night,” said he, “yon castle tow'rs “Shall echo to their centre! “For, by the holy cross, I swear,”— And straight a cross of ruby glare Did through the wicket enter! And now a snowy hand was seen Slow moving round the chamber! A clasp of pearl it seem'd to bear— A clasp of pearl, most rich and rare! Fix'd to a zone of amber. And now the lonely hovel shook, The wicket open flying; And by the croaking raven flew, And, whistling shrill, the night-blast blew, Like shrieks that mark the dying! But suddenly the tumult ceas'd— And silence, still more fearful, Around her little chamber spread, Such horrors as attend the dead, Where no sun glitters cheerful! “Now, Jesu, hear me!” Golfre cried, “Hear me!” a faint voice mutter'd! The baron drew his poniard forth— The maiden sunk upon the earth, And—“Save me, heav'n!” she utter'd. “Yes, heav'n will save thee,” Golfre said, “Save thee to be my bride!” But while he spoke, a beam of light Shone on her bosom, deathly white, Then onward seem'd to glide. And now the goatherd, on his knees, With frantic accent cried, “O! God forbid! that I should see “The beauteous Zorietto be “The Baron Golfre's bride! “Poor lady! she did shrink and fall, “As leaves fall in September! “Then be not Baron Golfre's bride— “Alack! in yon black tow'r she died— “Full well I do remember! “Oft to the lattice grate I stole, “To hear her sweetly singing; “And oft, whole nights, beside the moat, “I listen'd to the dying note— “Till matin's bell was ringing. “And when she died! poor lady dear! “A sack of gold she gave, “That masses every Christmas day “Twelve bare-foot monks should sing, or say, “Slow moving round her grave. “That, at the Holy Virgin's shrine, “Three lamps should burn for ever— “That ev'ry month the bell should toll, “For pray'rs to save her husband's soul— “I shall forget it never!” While thus he spoke, the baron's eye Look'd inward on his soul: For he the masses ne'er had said— No lamps their quiv'ring light had shed, No bell been taught to toll! And yet the bell did toll, self-mov'd; And sickly lamps were gleaming; And oft their faintly wand'ring light Illum'd the chapel aisles at night, Till morn's broad eye was beaming. PART FOURTH. The maid refus'd the baron's suit, For well she lov'd another; The angry Golfre's vengeful rage Nor pride nor reason could assuage, Nor pity prompt to smother. His sword was gone; the goatherd swain Seem'd guilty, past recalling: The baron now his life demands, Where the tall gibbet skirts the lands, With black'ning bones appalling! Low at the baron's feet, in tears, Fair Zorietto kneeling, The goatherd's life requir'd;—but found That pride can give the deepest wound Without the pang of feeling. That pow'r can mock the suff'rer's woes, And triumph o'er the sighing; Can scorn the noblest mind oppress'd, Can fill with thorns the feeling breast, Soft pity's tear denying. “Take me,” she cried, “but spare his age— “Let me his ransom tender; “I will the fatal deed atone, “For crimes that never were my own, “My breaking heart surrender.” The marriage day was fix'd, the tow'rs With banners rich were mounted; His heart beat high against his side, While Golfre, waiting for his bride, The weary minutes counted. The snow fell fast, with mingling hail, The dawn was late and louring; Poor Zorietto rose aghast! Unmindful of the northern blast, And prowling wolves devouring. Swift to the wood of pines she flew, Love made the assignation; For there the sov'reign of her soul Watch'd the blue mists of morning roll Around her habitation. The baron, by a spy appriz'd, Was there before his bride; He seiz'd the youth, and madly strew'd The white cliff with his streaming blood, Then hurl'd him down its side. And now, 'twas said, an hungry wolf Had made the youth his prey: His heart lay frozen on the snow, And here and there a purple glow Speckled the pathless way. The marriage day at length arriv'd, The priest bestow'd his blessing: A clasp of orient pearl fast bound A zone of amber circling round, Her slender waist compressing. On Zorietto's snowy breast A ruby cross was heaving: So the pale snow-drop faintly glows, When shelter'd by the damask rose, Their beauties interweaving! And now the holy vow began Upon her lips to falter! And now all deathly wan she grew, And now three lamps of livid hue Pass'd slowly round the altar. And now she saw the clasp of pearl A ruby lustre taking; And thrice she heard the castle bell Ring out a loud funereal knell, The antique turrets shaking. O! then how pale the baron grew, His eyes wide staring fearful! While o'er the virgin's image fair A sable veil was borne on air, Shading her dim eyes tearful. And on her breast a clasp of pearl Was stain'd with blood, fast flowing: And round her lovely waist she wore An amber zone; a cross she bore Of rubies, richly glowing. The bride, her dove-like eyes to heav'n Rais'd, calling Christ to save her! The cross now danc'd upon her breast; The shudd'ring priest his fears confest, And benedictions gave her. Upon the pavement sunk the bride, Cold as a corpse, and fainting; The pearly clasp, self-bursting, show'd Her beating side, where crimson glow'd Three spots of nature's painting. Three crimson spots of deepest hue! The baron gaz'd with wonder: For on his buried lady's side Just three such drops had nature dy'd, An equal space asunder. And now remembrance brought to view, (For heav'n the truth discloses,) The baby, who had early died, Bore, tinted on its little side, Three spots—as red as roses! Now, ere the wedding-day had past, Stern Golfre and his bride Walk'd forth to taste the evening breeze, Soft sighing mid the sombre trees, That drest the mountain's side. And now, beneath the grove of pine, Two lovely forms were gliding; A lady, with a beauteous face! A youth, with stern, but manly grace, Smil'd,—as in scorn deriding. Close by the wand'ring bride they pass'd, The red sun sinking slowly: And to the little cross they hied— And there she saw them, side by side, Kneeling with fervour holy. The little cross was golden ting'd, The western radiance stealing; And now it bore a purple hue, And now all black and dim it grew, And still she saw them kneeling. White were their robes as fleecy snow, Their faces pale, yet cheerful: Their golden hair, like waves of light, Shone lust'rous mid the glooms of night; Their starry eyes were tearful. And now they look'd to heav'n, and smil'd, Three paly lamps descended! And now their shoulders seem'd to bear Expanding pinions broad and fair, And now they wav'd in viewless air! And so the vision ended. PART FIFTH. Now, suddenly, a storm arose, The thunder roar'd tremendous! The lightning flash'd, the howling blast, Fierce, strong, and desolating, past The altitudes stupendous! Rent by the wind, a fragment huge From the steep summit bounded: That summit, where the peasant's breast Found, 'mid the snow, a grave of rest, By Golfre's poniard wounded. Loud shrieks across the mountain wild, Fill'd up the pause of thunder: The groves of pine the lightning past, And swift the desolating blast Scatter'd them wide asunder. The castle turrets seem'd to blaze, The lightning round them flashing; The draw-bridge now was all on fire, The moat foam'd high with furious ire, Against the black walls dashing. The prison tow'r was silver white, And radiant as the morning; Two angel's wings were spreading wide, The battlements, from side to side, And lofty roof adorning. And now the bride was sore afraid, She sigh'd, and cross'd her breast; She kiss'd her simple rosary, Made of the mountain holly-tree, By sainted fathers blest. She kiss'd it once, she kiss'd it twice; It seem'd to freeze her breast; The cold show'rs fell from ev'ry tree, They fell upon her rosary, Like nature's tears, “twice blest!” “What do you fear?” the baron cried— For Zorietto trembled.— “A wolf,” she sigh'd with whisper low, “Hark how the angry whirlwinds blow, “Like demons dark assembled! “That wolf which did my lover slay!” The bàron wildly started. “That wolf accurs'd!” she madly cried— “Whose fangs by human gore were dy'd, “Who dragg'd him down the mountain's side, “And left me—broken hearted!” Now Golfre shook in ev'ry joint, He grasp'd her arm, and mutter'd; Hell seem'd to yawn on ev'ry side; “Hear me!” the frantic tyrant cried— “Hear me!” a faint voice utter'd. “I hear thee! yes, I hear thee well!” Cried Golfre, “I'll content thee: “I see thy vengeful eye-balls roll— “Thou com'st to claim my guilty soul— “The fiends—the fiends have sent thee!” And now a goatherd-boy was heard, Swift climbing up the mountain: A kid was lost, the fearful hind Had rov'd his truant care to find, By woodland's side and fountain. And now a murm'ring throng advanc'd, And howlings echo'd round them: Now Golfre tried the path to pace, His feet seem'd rooted to the place, As though a spell had bound them. And now loud mingling voices cried— “Pursue that wolf, pursue him!” The guilty baron, conscience stung, About his fainting daughter hung, As to the ground she drew him. “O! shield me, holy Mary! shield “A tortur'd wretch!” he mutter'd. “A murd'rous wolf! O God! I crave “A dark, unhallow'd, silent grave—” Aghast, the caitiff utter'd. “'Twas I, beneath the goatherd's bed, “The golden sword did cover; “'Twas I who tore the quiv'ring wound, “Pluck'd forth the heart, and scatter'd round “The life-stream of thy lover.” And now he writh'd in ev'ry limb, And big his heart was swelling; Fresh peals of thunder echo'd strong, With famish'd wolves the peaks among Their dismal chorus yelling! “O Jesu, save me!” Golfre shriek'd— But Golfre shriek'd no more! The rosy dawn's returning light Display'd his corse,—a dreadful sight, Black, wither'd, smear'd with gore! High on a gibbet, near the wood, His mangled limbs were hung; Yet Zorietto oft was seen Prostrate the chapel aisles between, When holy mass was sung. And there three lamps now dimly burn,— Twelve monks their masses saying; And there the midnight bell doth toll, For quiet to the murd'rer's soul— While all around are praying. For charity and pity kind, To gentle souls are giv'n; And mercy is the sainted pow'r Which beams thro' mis'ry's darkest hour, And lights the way—to heav'n. JASPER. I The night was long, 'twas winter time, The moon shone pale and clearly; The woods were bare, the nipping air Across the heath, as cold as death, Blew shrilly and severely. II And awful was the midnight scene! The silent river flowing, The dappled sky, the screech-owl's cry, The blackning tow'r, the haunted bow'r, Where pois'nous weeds were growing! III With footsteps quick, and fev'rish heart, One tatter'd garment wearing, Poor Jasper, sad, alone, and mad, Now chaunted wild, and now he smil'd, With eyes wide fix'd and glaring. IV His cheek was wan, his lip was blue, His head was bare and shaggy; His limbs were torn by many a thorn; For he had pac'd the pathless waste, And climb'd the steep rock craggy. V An iron window in the tow'r Slow creek'd as it was swinging; A gibbet stood beside the wood, The blast did blow it to and fro, The rusty chains were ringing. VI His voice was hollow as the tone Of cavern'd winds, and mournful; No tears could flow, to calm his woe; Yet on his face sat manly grace, And grief, sublimely scornful! VII Twelve freezing nights poor Jasper's breast Had brav'd the tempests yelling; For mis'ry keen his lot had been Since he had left, of sense bereft, A tyrant father's dwelling. VIII That father, who with lordly pride, Saw him from Mary sever; Saw her fair cheek in silence speak, Her eyes blue light, so heav'nly bright, Grow dim, and fade for ever! IX “How hot yon sun begins to shine!” The maniac cried, loud laughing: “I feel the pain that burns my brain; “Thy sulphur beam bids ocean steam, “Where all the fiends are quaffing. X “Soft! soft! the dew begins to rise, “I'll drink it while 'tis flowing; “Down ev'ry tree the bright rills see, “Quick let me sip, they'll cool my lip, “For now my blood is glowing. XI “Hark! the she-wolf howling by! “Poor Jasper smiles to hear thee; “For he can hide by the hedge-row's side, “While storms shall sweep the mountain's steep; “Then, she-wolf, can he fear thee? XII “Pale moon! thou spectre of the sky! “I see thy white shroud waving: “And now behold thy bosom cold— “Oh! mem'ry sad, it made me mad! “Then wherefore mock my raving? XIII “Yes! on my Mary's bosom cold “Death laid his bony fingers. “Hark! how the wave begins to lave “The rocky shore!—I hear it roar— “The whirling pilot lingers! XIV “Oh! bear me, bear me o'er the main! “See the white sails are flying: “Yon glitt'ring star shall be my car, “And by my side shall Mary glide, “Mild as the south wind sighing. XV “My bare-foot way is mark'd with blood— “Well—what care I for sorrow? “The sun shall rise to cheer the skies, “The wintry day shall pass away, “And summer smile to-morrow! XVI “The frosted heath is wide and drear, “And rugged is my pillow; “Soon shall I sleep beneath the deep— “How calm to me that sleep will be, “Rock'd by the bounding billow! XVII “The village clock strikes mournfully, “It is my death-bell tolling; “But though yon cloud begins to shroud “The gliding moon, the day-stream soon “Shall down yon steep come rolling.

Oh! do not fear— “Thy Jasper flies to meet thee!” XXIX “Now to the silent river's side “Poor Jasper rush'd unwary; With frantic haste the green bank pac'd, Plung'd in the wave—no friend to save, And, sinking, call'd—on Mary! LONDON's SUMMER MORNING. Who has not wak'd to list the busy sounds Of summer's morning, in the sultry smoke Of noisy London? On the pavement hot The sooty chimney-boy, with dingy face And tatter'd covering, shrilly bawls his trade, Rousing the sleepy housemaid. At the door The milk-pail rattles, and the tinkling bell Proclaims the dustman's office; while the street Is lost in clouds impervious. Now begins The din of hackney-coaches, waggons, carts; While tinmen's shops, and noisy trunk-makers, Knife-grinders, coopers, squeaking cork-cutters, Fruit-barrows, and the hunger-giving cries Of vegetable venders, fill the air. Now ev'ry shop displays its varied trade, And the fresh-sprinkled pavement cools the feet Of early walkers. At the private door The ruddy housemaid twirls the busy mop, Annoying the smart 'prentice, or neat girl, Tripping with band-box lightly. Now the sun Darts burning splendour on the glitt'ring pane, Save where the canvas awning throws a shade On the gay merchandize. Now, spruce and trim, In shops (where beauty smiles with industry,) Sits the smart damsel; while the passenger Peeps thro' the window, watching ev'ry charm. Now pastry dainties catch the eye minute Of humming insects, while the limy snare Waits to enthral them. Now the lamp-lighter Mounts the tall ladder, nimbly vent'rous, To trim the half-fill'd lamp; while at his feet The pot-boy yells discordant! All along The sultry pavement, the old-clothes-man cries In tone monotonous, and side-long views The area for his traffic: now the bag Is slily open'd, and the half-worn suit (Sometimes the pilfer'd treasure of the base Domestic spoiler), for one half its worth, Sinks in the green abyss. The porter now Bears his huge load along the burning way; And the poor poet wakes from busy dreams, To paint the summer morning. LINES. Bid me the ills of life endure, Ills that shall rend my heart! Bid me resign the hope of cure, And cherish endless smart! Bid me a weary wand'rer be, But never bid me part from thee! Bid me encounter vulgar scorn; And, hopeless of relief, Bid me awake each sadden'd morn, To feed the source of grief! Bid me from pomp and splendour flee, But never bid me fly from thee! Bid me o'er barren deserts rove, O'er mountains rude and bare; Bid me the keenest torments prove, That feeling bosoms share! Bid me no dawn of comfort see— I'll bear it all—if blest with thee! LESBIA AND HER LOVER. Lesbia upon her bosom wore The semblance of her lover; And oft with kisses she would cover The senseless idol, and adore The dear capricious rover. Lesbia would gaze upon his eyes, And think they look'd so speaking, That oft her gentle heart was breaking; While glancing round with frequent sighs, She seem'd her lover seeking! One day, says reason, “Why embrace “A cold and senseless lover? “What charms can youthful eyes discover “In such a varnish'd, painted face? “Prithee the task give over.” Cried Lesbia, “Reason, wherefore blame? “Must you the cause be told? “My breathing lover I behold “With features painted just the same— “As senseless and as cold! “Then, reason, 'tis the better way “The harmless to commend; “My breathing lover soon would end “My weary life, to grief a prey— “This never can offend!” TO JEALOUSY. A thousand torments wait on love; The sigh, the tear, the anguish'd groan! But he who never learnt to prove A jealous pang, has nothing known. For jealousy, supreme of woe, Nurs'd by distorted fancy's pow'r, Can round the heart bid mis'ry grow, Which darkens with the ling'ring hour; While shadows, blanks to reason's orb, In dread succession haunt the brain; And pangs, that ev'ry pang absorb, In wild convulsive tumults reign. At morn, at eve, the fever burns, While phantoms tear the aching breast; Day brings no calm, and night returns, But marks no soothing hour of rest. Nor when the bosom's wasted fires Are all extinct, is anguish o'er; For jealousy, which ne'er expires, Can wound—when passion is no more. TO A FRIEND WHO ASKED THE AUTHOR'S OPINION OF A KISS. “What is a kiss?” 'tis but a seal That, warmly printed, soon decays; 'Tis but a zephyr taught to steal Where fleeting falsehood, smiling, plays. The breeze will kiss the flow'r—but soon From flow'r to weed inconstant blows: Such is the kiss of love, the boon Which fickle fancy oft bestows. A perfum'd kiss once Venus gave The rose that caught her lover's sigh; That rose with ev'ry gale wou'd wave, At ev'ry glance of morning die: Would give its radiance to the beam Which glowing noon promiscuous threw; Or to the twilight's parting gleam Would yield responsive tears of dew. Oft to the bee its love would give, And breathe its odours wild around; With honied sweets bid pleasure live, Or with its hidden mischiefs wound. This rose was white, and to be blest, Around it insect myriads flew, Charm'd by the wonders of its breast, Thrice essenc'd in the summer dew. But when the lip of beauty shed A rival sweetness on that breast, It blush'd, and droop'd its fragrant head, Asham'd to be so proudly blest. Its colour chang'd, a crimson glow, Fix'd on its alter'd form, appears; While round the sighing zephyrs blow, And nature bathes its leaves in tears. Then, does not ev'ry kiss impart, In magic thrills of speechless pleasure, Reproaches to the wand'ring heart, That knows not how to prize the treasure? O yes! then let my bosom prove No throb—but friendship's throb divine; And let the kiss of fickle love, Capricious monitor,—be thine! A REFLECTION. The loathsome toad, whose mis'ry feeds On noxious dews and baneful weeds, Disgusts the startled sight; Yet, when the sultry vapours low'r, He drinks the poison from each flow'r, Shook by the wings of night. Behold the beauteous speckled snake, Writhing amidst the leafy brake, Gilt by the beams of day: Mark, as the wand'ring victim's eyes Fix on its dazzling orient dyes, The traitor stings its prey! Trace, then, the moral, simply true; Here nature's varying picture view, Where outward forms deceive; Where worth in loathsome garb we find, While glitt'ring vice, with pow'r combin'd, In splendid baseness live! THE POET's GARRET. Come, sportive fancy! come with me, and trace The poet's attic home! the lofty seat Of the heav'n-tutor'd nine! the airy throne Of bold imagination, rapture fraught Above the herds of mortals. All around A solemn stillness seems to guard the scene, Nursing the brood of thought—a thriving brood In the rich mazes of the cultur'd brain. Upon thy altar, an old worm-eat board, The pannel of a broken door, or lid Of a strong coffer, plac'd on three-legg'd stool, Stand quires of paper, white and beautiful! Paper, by destiny ordain'd to be Scrawl'd o'er and blotted; dash'd, and scratch'd, and torn; Or mark'd with lines severe, or scatter'd wide In rage impetuous! Sonnet, song, and ode, Satire, and epigram, and smart charade; Neat paragraph, or legendary tale, Of short and simple metre, each by turns Will there delight the reader. On the bed Lies an old rusty suit of “solemn black,”— Brush'd thread-bare, and, with brown, unglossy hue, Grown somewhat ancient. On the floor is seen A pair of silken hose, whose footing bad Shews they are trav'llers, but who still bear Marks somewhat holy. At the scanty fire A chop turns round, by packthread strongly held; And on the blacken'd bar a vessel shines Of batter'd pewter, just half fill'd, and warm, With Whitbread's bev'rage pure. The kitten purs, Anticipating dinner; while the wind Whistles thro' broken panes, and drifted snow Carpets the parapet with spotless garb, Of vestal coldness. Now the sullen hour (The fifth hour after noon) with dusky hand Closes the lids of day. The farthing light Gleams thro' the cobwebb'd chamber, and the bard Concludes his pen's hard labour. Now he eats With appetite voracious! nothing sad That he with costly plate, and napkins fine, Nor china rich, nor fork of silver, greets His eye or palate. On his lyric board A sheet of paper serves for table-cloth; An heap of salt is serv'd,—oh! heav'nly treat! On ode Pindaric! while his tuneful puss Scratches his slipper for her fragment sweet, And sings her love-song soft, yet mournfully. Mocking the pillar Doric, or the roof Of architecture Gothic, all around The well-known ballads flit, of Grub-street fame! The casement, broke, gives breath celestial To the long dying-speech; or gently fans The love-inflaming sonnet. All around Small scraps of paper lie, torn vestiges Of an unquiet fancy. Here a page Of flights poetic—there a dedication— A list of dramatis personæ, bold, Of heroes yet unborn, and lofty dames Of perishable compound, light as fair, But sentenc'd to oblivion! On a shelf, (Yclept a mantle-piece) a phial stands, Half fill'd with potent spirits!—spirits strong, Which sometimes haunt the poet's restless brain, And fill his mind with fancies whimsical. Poor poet! happy art thou, thus remov'd From pride and folly! for in thy domain Thou can'st command thy subjects; fill thy lines; Wield th' all-conqu'ring weapon heav'n bestows On the grey goose's wing! which, tow'ring high, Bears thy sick fancy to immortal fame! To JOHN TAYLOR, Esq. To the heart that has feeling, what gift is so rare As the wreath which the hand of true elegance weaves? 'Tis the only delight which proud friendship can share; For bestowing it, tastes the same rapture it gives! Like the soft dews of morning, it flows from the mind! To expand the weak blossom, just waking to day! Like the sunbeam, with warmth and with lustre combin'd, It diffuses its perfumes, and bids it look gay! Then think not the praises your kindness bestows, Like the zephyrs, pass over my bosom, and die; For, I know, 'tis from friendship the bright current flows, That reflects the small flow'ret with tints of the sky! With the fair hand of nature to guide me along, I no laurel from art or from learning implore! For my bosom, that prompts the rude efforts of song, Courts the wild-rose of fancy, and asks for no more! The rose that pure friendship divests of its thorns! And the breath of fond praise bids eternally bloom! That thro' life the rough path-way with fragrance adorns! And with hope's gentle promise encircles the tomb! LINES Sent by Peter Pindar to Mrs. Robinson, borrowing her Lap-Dog to paint his Likeness. From her who sweeps the Sapphic lyre, Come, pretty cur, whom I admire; A moment quit her fond embrace. Yes, little creature, haste away, Whate'er thy name, Bejoux or Tray; And let me paint thy mop-like face. O tell thy mistress, if she choose Her idle moments to amuse With my shock poll, instead of thine, She's welcome, up or in her bed, To smooth my ears or pat my head, And bid me on her breast recline. Were this to happen, I should be, O cur, a happier dog than thee. THE ANSWER. BY MRS. ROBINSON. O Peter! since thy sportive Muse A puppy for her theme will choose, How envied must his race of brothers be! How will their mop-like tresses flow, How will their mops and long ears glow, When crown'd by genius, Peter, and by thee! But thou, the Muses' watch-dog, Peter, Who scar'd the highest with thy metre, Thou never would'st a servile state survive: Thou would'st not wear a puppy's chain, But treating bondage with disdain, Would'st hope to lead where I would wish to drive. Then, Peter, boast a nobler pate, Nor envy Shock's inglorious state; For, know, the puppy species I despise! With thee I'll wander, wake, or dream, By Helicon's immortal stream, Where Peter guards a passage to the skies! But if, in sportive vein, you seek To paint a puppy's whisker'd cheek, My little fav'rite shall your levee grace; For oft, if they are not bely'd, At levees, in due pomp and pride, The highest patronize the fawning race. My dog has something more to boast; He scorns the cringing, sneaking host, And looks to lasting wreaths by genius twin'd; Since Peter, with his magic help, Will keep in countenance the whelp, And prove the painter, like the puppy—kind! TO LEONARDO. And dost thou hope to fan my flame With the soft breath of friendship's name? And dost thou think the thin disguise Can veil the mischief from my eyes? Alas, sweet bard! the dazzling ray Long round my fearful heart did play, In reason's sober mantle drest; It pour'd warm incense on my breast, My mind in rosy fetters bound, Then, smiling, gave th' insidious wound! Yes, I have liv'd each bliss to feel That o'er the sensate heart can steal; Have tasted all that youth could bring On giddy fashion's painted wing; Have mark'd the base and sordid mind Couch'd in the sentiment refin'd! Have known flush'd adulation's song The brain's weak lab'rinths wind among, And with its feath'ry touch impart Corroding anguish to the heart! Have heard the soothing, specious tale O'er th' unguarded sense prevail, In ev'ry varying clime the same, Under the mask of friendship's name. Harmonious bard! if thou hast found Envenom'd slander's careless wound; If hopes o'erthrown, and jealous fears, Have drench'd thy manly cheek with tears; If fell caprice, insatiate fiend, Has taught the darling of thy mind, Unblushing, with the vile to rove In the coarse path of vagrant love; O scorn the wretch, subdue thy pains, And soar exulting from her chains! Yes, I can “triumph,” I can “bear,” Can quell the ruthless fiend despair; Can brave ingratitude's keen dart, And pluck it, rankling, from my heart. But cease thy soft notes' silver strain, That wakes thy soul to living pain; Cease to recall thy slumb'ring mind To all the pangs it left behind: Perhaps again love's potent art May wind a spell about thy heart, May round its branching fibres twine The thrilling joy, the hope divine, Thy feeling breast again may prove Th' ecstatic harmonies of love. Nor will I bend my lonely way Where cheerless horror veils the day: Can Lapland's chilling spheres control The genial warmth that swells the soul? 'Midst lakes of ice, or clouds of snow, Thy swelling bosom still would glow; Nor will its vivid pow'rs decay 'Till life's last flame shall fade away! THE SNAKE AND THE LINNET. A FABLE. Inscribed to her who will remember it. Self-pamper'd ignorance, in fancied state, Frowns on the humbler dignity of worth! Thro' life's short summer, miserably great; And, born illustrious—shames the pride of birth! Beside a wood, whose lofty shade O'ercanopy'd the neigh'bring glade, Where no rude wand'rer's step was seen To print the dew that gemm'd the green; Where many a wild-flow'r, scatter'd round, Shed fragrance o'er the enamell'd ground; Beneath a branch of verdant hue, To chaunt its lays, a linnet flew; Tir'd of its life, it sought repose, And pour'd its plaint, to sooth its woes: For long the tuneful feather'd choir Had vex'd its heart with envious ire; And, conscious of its sweeter lays, With insult mock'd its harmless days. Its soft song echo'd through the grove, Mild as the murmurs of the dove; Not e'en the lark's melodious throat Could emulate its thrilling note. Oft, at still evening's hour, it flew To sip the drops of scented dew, That, trickling from the cowslip's head, Adorn'd with pearls its mossy bed; While owls and ravens, hov'ring near, With screams discordant dinn'd its ear: For hateful to th' envious throng, Are the sweet sounds of witching song; And vainly shall its magic steal O'er the dull mind that cannot feel. Near, on a bank, with flow'rets drest, A speckled reptile form'd its nest; Oft would it writhe in wanton play, And bask beneath the solar ray. The snake the gentle warbler spy'd, In all its charms—in all its pride; And, dazzled with its lustrous dies, Its shining form, its brilliant eyes, Flew round its head with curious gaze, And wanton'd 'midst its leafy maze; But, ah! the linnet's 'witching strain Assail'd its tasteless ears in vain; For the fell snake, with murd'rous art, Glanc'd at its breast, and stung its heart! 'Tis thus the fairest forms invite, With glitt'ring charms, the wond'ring sight: We gaze upon the beauteous mien, Nor dread its mischiefs while unseen; Nor feel, that modest worth confess'd Inflames with rage the envious breast; While mean and fulsome flatt'ry finds A welcome pass—to vulgar minds! ODE. THE EAGLE AND FLOCK OF GEESE. How rarely, by the outward show, The inward soul can mortals know! How gaudy flits the insect's wing, While we gaze, heedless of its sting! How lustrous to the startled eye Seems the swift lightning, darting by! But moralizing is so very old, A fable shall, in lieu of it, be told. Once on a time, an eagle bold, (Appointed by his master, Jove, O'er this terrestrial sphere to rove) Held his high station on a sea-girt shore, Where many a whit'ning billow roll'd, Laving the strand with desolating roar! Long had he tow'r'd the sov'reign of the peak, His cloud-roof'd nest defied the wind and rain; A solitude sublime, Sacred to deathless time! No human foot the craggy height would seek, Save where the ship-wreck'd soul, despairing, clung On the wild weeds that round it hung, Or wav'd fantastic, mocking the rous'd main! There, 'mid the deaf'ning din of wind and wave, This lordly bird his daring eye would roll; And oft his pinions in the green-deep lave, And oft, with rav'nous beak, the lesser birds control: The curlew's yell, the bittern's hollow cry, Wou'd greet the lofty despot passing by; 'Till all the neigh'bouring rocks were left, and he Reign'd tyrant of the cliff that bound the raging sea. Sick with the plenitude of pow'r, This eagle, in a gloomy hour, Regardless of his master, Jove, Resolv'd to rove; And, skimming o'er the waters wide, Ambition-taught, a new dominion tried. On th' ethereal floods of day, He bent, with eager rage, his ardent way; With steady eye he view'd the solar blaze, And bask'd, undazzled, in meridian rays; Full on the western gale his course pursued, And, with imperious pride, bath'd in the sunny flood! To make my fable short, this bird, Like many of ambition's race, With consciousness of strength was grown absurd, Or, plainer speaking, sought his own disgrace: The bird of mighty Jove (thought he) May scatter wide the bolts of destiny. Away he flies! Thirsting for carnage, eager to embrue His talons in the streaming blood Of lesser birds (more useful and more good:) For this proud eagle knew no joy Like that which prompts the pow'rful to destroy! Soon to a distant scene he came, Where, on a yellow, broomy heath, Quaffing the dawn's resuscitating breath, Waddled a flock of geese, peaceful and tame: No tow'ring wings had they, but fed content On stubble, or what bounteous nature sent; And, till this luckless hour, They felt, by an instinctive pow'r, That the wide mead, and golden heath, The breezy morn, the sunny noon, The dewy vale, soft twilight's breath, Sighing its odours to the modest moon; Skies, seasons, herbage, water, wind, Were all for nature's commoners design'd; That the world-fostering sun O'er all his equal journey run: Poor fools! they little knew that heav'n's best things Were portion'd out by birds with eagle wings; That all the lord of sunny lustre seizes, He hovers o'er, and gives them what he pleases; That is to say, he lets them all alone Provided he may call the airy world—his own! The eagle now was hov'ring near; The geese look'd up askance, and gabbled loud with fear! “Dull birds!” the sun-ey'd desolator cried, “Soon in your panting hearts my talons shall be dy'd! “Plebeian brawlers! you shall know “That I was destin'd to subdue “Such things as you! “And crush your little empire base and low. “Look at these eyes, “Behold the fire that in them lies! “View my resistless wing, “Form'd from etherial heights to spring! “Tho' gaunt my lofty form, “Toil-worn with many a busy storm, “With restless nights and restless days, “Still can I meet the sun with dauntless gaze; “That sun which lends me all his light, “And sanctions my aërial flight: “Plebeians bold, “Shrink and behold!” “Well!” cried a gander, fierce and old, “We listen, and we do behold! “We hear thee arrogant and vain, “Disturbing this our peaceful plain! “We know that fate has giv'n thee pow'r “O'er earth, and oceans vast, to scow'r; “But what attends thy lofty flight? “Do you not ravage all you find, “Filling the harmless with affright, “And mangling our defenceless kind? “Shame on such cruel sport, away! “Go hide thy meager form in shades, “Brave not the redden'd front of day, “But skulk in cavern'd rocks and gloomy glades. “No use art thou to human-kind; “For tho' with crimson rag, our race “Is driv'n to slaughter and disgrace, “Still are we for some good design'd: “And tho' we yield our little breath, “We save the creature man from death: “We feed him, and he finds his ends “In making humble birds his friends: “While fierce despoilers, such as thee, “But dash with bitter woes our cup of destiny!” So says the fable! Let the eagle's wing Above such lowly teachers fly; For harmless, humble, peaceful birds, I sing, Their fellow-commoner, and nature's laureat, I! LINES Written on a Day of Public Rejoicing! While shouts and acclamations rend the skies, From the deep ocean, bleeding, cold, and wan, See groaning spectres in a phalanx rise, To mourn the mis'ries of ambitious man! O'er them the rude sea dashes, mix'd with gore; The wild winds howl in dreadful blasts along; The sulphur show'rs upon the high deck roar, And livid lightnings flash the wave among! Here glides the parent, bleeding is his breast! Here the lost husband falls, and, groaning, dies! Here the lov'd sons, the mother's darlings, rest, While o'er their mangled limbs the billows rise! Are these forgot? Oh! nature! yet awhile Shed the soft tear, and heave the tender sigh; Suspend the shout of triumph, rapture's smile; And raise, in sorrow raise, the tearful eye. Let reason, truth, religion's pow'r divine, Call to the feeling and reflecting mind The wretched suff'rers who in anguish pine— The soldier's, sailor's kindred—left behind! And while the long-drawn pompous cavalcade Bids clam'rous exultation lift the head; Let mild humanity the triumph aid, And pity's tear embalm the sainted dead! THE SWAN. Majestic bird! who lov'st to glide In all the plumid pomp of pride! Who in the glassy stream all day Pursu'st the bright pellucid way! Why art thou, bird of splendid grace, More favour'd than thy kindred race? Why art thou form'd so wond'rous fair, With downy breast, and pinions rare? And wherefore, on the liquid way, Dost thou enjoy superior sway? No song is thine, no thrilling note Winds dulcet from thy beauteous throat; No mazy flight thy wings essay Along the burning plains of day! No murm'ring cadence marks in thee Love's soul-entrancing minstrelsey! Thou canst not raise the eagle eye To greet the sov'reign of the sky! No sweetly social instinct sways The tenour of thy placid days; Man finds in thee no cheerful song To lead his weary feet along; No mild domestic friend to pour Soft music thro' life's sombre hour: For thou, to sullen pleasures prone, Liv'st, proudly, for thyself alone! The lark, that soars on early wing, And, soaring, loves his joy to sing; The swallow, who to distant skies, Allur'd by gentler zephyrs, flies; The thrush, that twitters while the dawn Spreads purpling lustre o'er the lawn, Are richer far in pow'rs than thee, With all thy vaunted majesty! Then what avails thy lofty crest? What all the down that clothes thy breast? What thy slow-gliding haughty grace, That scarcely moves the lucid space? Man finds in thee no soft control To heal the pain-inflicted soul! For outward beauty's pleasing pow'r Charms only for its little hour; And reason sickens when we find A form without a kindred mind! LINES ON HEARING A GENTLEMAN DECLARE, THAT NO WOMEN WERE SO HANDSOME AS THE ENGLISH. Beauty, the attribute of heav'n, In various forms to mortals giv'n, With magic skill enslaves mankind, As sportive fancy sways the mind. Search the wide world—go where you will, Variety pursues you still: Capricious nature knows no bound, Her unexhausted gifts are found In ev'ry clime, in ev'ry face, Each has its own peculiar grace. To Gallia's frolic scenes repair, There reigns the tiny debonnaire; The mincing step, the slender waist, The lip with bright vermilion grac'd; The short pert nose, the pearly teeth, With the small dimpled chin beneath; The social converse, gay and free, The smart bon mot and repartée. Italia boasts the melting fair, The pointed step, the stately air; Th' impassion'd look, the languid eye, The voice of thrilling harmony; Insidious love, conceal'd in smiles, That charms, and as it charms, beguiles. View Grecian maids, whose finish'd forms Th' admiring sculptor's fancy warms; There let thy wond'ring eye behold The softest gems of nature's mould; The look that Reynolds learnt to trace From Sheridan's bewitching face. Imperious Turkey's pride is seen In beauty's rich luxuriant mien; The dark and sparkling orbs that glow Beneath a polish front of snow; The auburn curl, which zephyr blows About the cheek of glowing rose; The shorten'd zone, the swelling breast, With costly gems profusely dress'd, Reclin'd in softly waving bow'rs, On painted beds of fragrant flow'rs; Where od'rous canopies dispense Arabia's spices to the sense; Where listless indolence and ease Proclaim the sov'reign wish—to please. 'Tis thus capricious fancy shows How far her frolic empire goes: On Asia's sands, on Alpine snow, We trace her steps where'er we go; The British maid with timid grace, The tawny Indian's varnish'd face, The jetty African, the fair Nurs'd by Europa's softer air, With various charms delight the mind; For fancy governs all mankind. STANZAS WRITTEN FOR “THE SHRINE OF BERTHA.” Pleas'd with the calm bewitching hour, When ev'ning shadows o'er the plain, I seek my solitary bow'r, And listen to the night-owl's strain! Here, where the woven ivy hangs, Once the rich shrine of marble rose! And chaste-ey'd vestals sigh'd their pangs, And bath'd, with icy tears, their woes. And here, where on the rugged ground The sculptur'd fragments scatter'd lie, Erst did the choral anthem sound, And holy incense meet the sky. What are ye now? ye arches drear, What can ye shew to sooth the breast? Save pensive twilight's frequent tear, That falls in crystal lustre drest! Yet o'er the scene of rude decay Blithe nature darts the morning beam! And here the blushing evening ray Inspires the soul with fancy's dream! And here wan Cynthia sheds her light, The shatter'd roofs and walls among; And here the solemn hour of night Is cheer'd by philomela's song! And here the pilgrim, poor and sad, No kindred smile his breast to warm, May find what cruel foes forbad, A shelter from the howling storm! Blow, blow, ye keen, ye ruthless winds! Ye livid light'nings, dart around! While terror freezes guilty minds, And conscience owns the cureless wound. Here can I view, unchill'd with dread, The lofty aisle and shadowy dome; The turrets tottering o'er the dead; The long-drawn monumental gloom! Here, still, without one holy rite, The hapless bertha's form shall sleep! While blushing rigour shrinks from light, And melancholy hides—to weep. With superstition gliding round, A thousand ghastly shades shall gleam; While o'er the dew-besprinkled ground Steals the faint moon's retiring beam! Yet, hither shall the red-breast bring The lily, and the palest rose; And all the fairest flow'rs of spring, To dress her bed—of long repose. Oh, gentle bird! no wand'rer rude Shall bid thee from these ruins flee; Blest minstrel of this solitude! Still shalt thou sing—to solace me STANZAS. [The chilling gale that nipp'd the rose] The chilling gale that nipp'd the rose, Now murm'ring sinks to soft repose; The shadowy vapours sail away Upon the silv'ry floods of day; Health breathes on ev'ry face I see; But, ah! she breathes no more on me! The butterfly, with rain-bow wing, Flits round the blushing front of spring; And if a gloomy hour appears, Fans her warm breast, and sips her tears. Love wakes the feather'd choir to glee; But, ah! they wake no more for me! The jasmine wafts its perfume meek, To kiss the rose's glowing cheek; Pale twilight sheds her vagrant show'rs To wake aurora's infant flow'rs; May smiles their native charms to see; But, ah! she smiles no more on me! The sea-boy, by the tempest's roar, Dash'd on some rude and rocky shore, Sees hope, amidst the furious foam, That points towards his distant home! But I, alas! shall never see Hope's radiant beam reflect on me! E'en Zembla's freezing sons, forlorn, Await their long-expected morn; Swift to their icy cliffs they run, To greet, at length, the tardy sun! But dark despair shall never see The dawn of comfort shine on me! Then, far I'll wander, where no ray Breaks thro' the gloom of doubtful day; There will I court the midnight hour, The ling'ring dawn, the wintry show'r; For cold and comfortless shall be Each future scene ordain'd for me! STANZAS. FROM “THE SHRINE OF BERTHA.” Farewell! dear haunts of pleasing woes! Ye sun-burnt vales and forests drear; Where oft, at ev'ning's solemn close, I drop the sad, the pensive tear. Farewell! ye vineyards, whose rich glow Derides the flaming orb of light! Ye limpid streams, that brawling flow, Ye vanes, that greet the traveller's sight. Farewell, ye shades of mountain pine, Ye rude rocks, black'ning o'er the wave; And, oh! farewell, dear rugged shrine, That marks my Bertha's lowly grave. I go to paths of brighter hue: Yet mem'ry oft shall wander here; And fancy still shall flow'rets strew, Begemm'd with pity's holy tear! And when to distant realms I stray, To mingling scenes of pomp and glee, Oft will I steal, lov'd shade, to pray, And drop a tender tear for thee! That tear perchance may give relief, And med'cine comfort to my woes! For oft from sympathetic grief The wounded bosom finds repose. Oh! I would ruminate and mourn From early dawn 'till fading eve; For midst the gay this heart forlorn Would turn to thee—and turn to grieve. Still would my zealous care display Each tribute thy sad fate demands! Oft would I scatter garlands gay, To shield thee from unhallow'd hands. When morn, its sunny wings spread wide, Should wake each flow'r of gaudiest hue, Thy shrine should glow with softer pride, My tears surpass its spangling dew! And when at ev'ning's crimson hour The bat and beetle flit around, Faint echo, from yon mould'ring tow'r, Should greet my song's prophetic sound. And when the tissued veil of night Should scatter wide a doubtful gloom, Oft would I steal from mortal sight, To weep and sigh o'er Bertha's tomb! But, ah! farewell! no more thy strain Shall vibrate thro' yon cloister's shade; No more enchant the village swain, Or sooth to hope the love-lorn maid! No more, when rapt in pensive mood, The convent's bell, with silver sound, Shall echo thro' yon spectred wood, To wake me from my dream profound; No more the distant taper's glare Shall thro' the painted windows burn, To mark the vesper hour of pray'r, And bid my truant steps—return! Oh, Bertha! since ordain'd to part, Since destin'd from thy dust to stray, Let resignation bathe my heart! And thy meek spirit—guide my way. THE MISER. Miser, why countest thou thy treasure, Thy ill got hoards of paltry gold? Hast thou a throb of secret pleasure When conscience whispers soft and slow, These are the shoals that from oppression flow, For which thy fame is sold? Why dost thou doat on useless ore? Thou hast no joy in all thy wealth; Thou never hear'st the simple poor Bless thy benevolence, and cry, While gratitude illumes the uprais'd eye, “Heav'n grant thee years of health!” Why dost thou, in the gloom of night, While the loud tempest rages wide, Tremble with horror's cold affright, And, grasping every shining woe, To some dark nook with falt'ring footsteps go, Thy useless heaps to hide? Dost thou not hear the thunder's voice, Reproving heav'n's just vengeance, speak? Dost thou not hear the fiends rejoice, While on thy tott'ring roof obscure, The tears of outrag'd nature whelming pour, To chill thy wither'd cheek? See thy lean frame, thy sunken eyes; Behold thy victor death, and know, That when the wretched miser dies, No bosom pities—on his tomb No grateful wreath of spring shall ever bloom, No tear of friendship flow! Forgotten—or, if not, abhorr'd! Can all thy treasures left behind, Bid memory thy toil reward, Or meek religion breathe to heav'n One pray'r that thou may'st ever be forgiv'n, O! miscreant unkind! Thou that wouldst live belov'd, caress'd, Let sweet humanity be giv'n By thee to e'en a foe distress'd: For where the child of virtue sighs, Where genius to thy open threshold flies, Know, 'tis the path to heav'n! STANZAS PRESENTED WITH A GOLD CHAIN RING TO A ONCE DEAR FRIEND. Oh! take these little easy chains, And may they hold you while you live: For know, each magic link contains The richest treasure I can give! An emblem, earnest, of my love! Pure as the gold that forms the toy; The more 'tis try'd, the more 'twill prove Beyond the touch of base alloy. As even as these links shall be The giver's mind, that scorns to range; And, like the heart ordain'd for thee, They may be broke! but cannot change! Then, take the little shining toy, And may it never quit thy sight; And let it be my proudest joy, To know my chains, tho' lasting, light! A FRAGMENT. I love the labyrinth, the silent glade, For soft repose, and conscious rapture made; The melancholy murmurs of the rill, The moaning zephyrs, and the breezy hill; The torrent, roaring from the flinty steep, The morning gales that o'er the landscape sweep, The shade that dusky twilight meekly draws O'er the calm interval of nature's pause! 'Till the chaste moon, slow stealing o'er the plain, Wraps the dark mountain in her silv'ry train! Soothing, with sympathetic tears, the breast That seeks for solitude, and sighs for rest! TO THE MAY FLY. Poor insect! what a little day Of sunny bliss is thine! And yet thou spread'st thy light wings gay, And bid'st them, spreading, shine. Thou humm'st thy short and busy tune, Unmindful of the blast; And careless, while 'tis burning noon, How quick that noon be past! A show'r would lay thy beauty low; The dew of twilight be The torrent of thy overthrow, Thy storm of destiny! Then spread thy little shining wing, Hum on thy busy lay! For man, like thee, has but his spring, Like thine, it fades away! JANUARY, 1795. Pavement slipp'ry, people sneezing, Lords in ermine, beggars freezing; Titled gluttons dainties carving, Genius in a garret starving. Lofty mansions, warm and spacious; Courtiers cringing and voracious; Misers scarce the wretched heeding; Gallant soldiers fighting, bleeding. Wives who laugh at passive spouses; Theatres, and meeting-houses; Balls, where simp'ring misses languish; Hospitals, and groans of anguish. Arts and sciences bewailing; Commerce drooping, credit failing; Placemen mocking subjects loyal; Separations, weddings royal. Authors who can't earn a dinner; Many a subtle rogue a winner; Fugitives for shelter seeking; Misers hoarding, tradesmen breaking. Taste and talents quite deserted; All the laws of truth perverted; Arrogance o'er merit soaring; Merit silently deploring. Ladies gambling night and morning; Fools the works of genius scorning; Ancient dames for girls mistaken, Youthful damsels quite forsaken. Some in luxury delighting; More in talking than in fighting; Lovers old, and beaux decrepid; Lordlings empty and insipid. Poets, painters, and musicians; Lawyers, doctors, politicians: Pamphlets, newspapers, and odes, Seeking fame by diff'rent roads. Gallant souls with empty purses, Gen'rals only fit for nurses; School-boys, smit with martial spirit, Taking place of vet'ran merit. Honest men who can't get places, Knaves who shew unblushing faces; Ruin hasten'd, peace retarded; Candour spurn'd, and art rewarded. IMPROMPTU Sent to a Friend who had left his Gloves, by mistake, at the Author's house on the preceding evening. Your gloves I send, My worthy friend, With no gallant intent: With gauntlet I No knight defy; So take it as 'tis meant. In merry mood, 'Tis understood, That frolic fancy loves, When eye-lids close In sweet repose, To steal a pair of gloves. But neither here (I vow and swear) My sportive measures rule; Too weak to wield The daring shield, Too old to play the fool. Tho' dark their hue, Their semblance true, Like fortune's frowns appear; By absence torn, Like me, they mourn For him—who thought them dear. Then take the pair, And let them share The warmth that from your breast On all bestows, The balm of woes, Which gives to sorrow—rest! These truant twins, To mend their sins, Shall wait your kind command; And ev'ry day, Or sad, or gay, Shall—take you by the hand. In solitude, 'Mid sorrows rude, Or passion's wildest storm, Where'er you go, Thro' weal or woe, You'll find them ever warm. So fare you well; This pair shall tell, And tell with lungs of leather, That friends who part, Must know the smart They never feel together. MADRIGAL. Love was a little blooming boy, Fond, innocent, and true; His ev'ry smile was fraught with joy, And ev'ry joy was new! Till stealing from his mother's side, The urchin lost his way; And wand'ring far o'er deserts wide, Thus, weeping, pour'd his lay: “O time! I'll dress thy locks of snow “With wreaths of fragrant flow'rs; “And all that rapture can bestow “Shall deck thy fleeting hours: “But for one day, one little day, “Thy wings in pity spare; “That I may homeward bend my way, “For all my wreaths are there.” Time, cheated by his tears and sighs, The wily god confess'd; When, soaring to his native skies, He sought his mother's breast! Short was his bliss! the treach'rous boy Was hurl'd from clime to clime, And found, amidst his proudest joy, He'd still the wings of time! ANACREONTIC. TO CUPID. Hither, god of pleasing pain, Hither bring my wand'ring swain; See, my bow'r is hung with roses, On my couch content reposes; See, fond hope her blush concealing, O'er the ivy'd threshold stealing; While to meet her, bliss advances— Mark their soft extatic glances! Here shall mirth his revels keep, While dull care retires to weep. Now the myrtle wreaths divine Round my auburn tresses twine; See, my white transparent vest Scarce confines my beating breast; Hark! the lyre's melodious measure Wakes the vapid soul to pleasure; Light-heel'd graces, tripping round, Scarcely print the velvet ground: Time arrests his busy wing, And wantons in the sportive ring; See! his scythe he throws away, And scorns to stint the rapt'rous day! See, advancing full of glee, Laughing health and jollity! Dapper fairies, skipping, strew Fragrant buds begemm'd with dew! See, the rosy god of wine, Crown'd with clust'ring boughs of vine, Sportive, mirth-inspiring guest, Temp'rance leads to grace the feast! See, the tuneful nine advance; And valour, with his laurel'd lance; And sport, with glowing cheek of fire; And bright-ey'd truth, and young desire; While in their train, with modest mien, Divine philanthropy is seen! And gentle friendship wand'ring nigh, And sympathy with tearful eye; While godlike genius, heav'n's best boast, Sheds radiance o'er the glitt'ring host! Come, then, god of pleasing pain, Come, then, with my wand'ring swain; See, my bow'r drops ruby wine, Canopy'd with twisted vine! See, in every citron grove, Luscious fruits, to feast my love. Bring him quickly, darling boy! Touch his heart with conscious joy: If he pines with jealous fears, With thy breath disperse his tears; If he sighs repentant, say, Love shall waft those sighs away! Zephyr, whose enamell'd wing Fans the perfum'd breast of spring, Essence on my pillow throws, Pilfer'd from the musky rose; Pillow! thou shalt ne'er be press'd Till my vagrant love shall rest! Say, thou rosy urchin, say, Is not life a fleeting day? Morn, a scene of childish folly; Evening, cold and melancholy? Let us revel while 'tis noon; Sombre night will shroud us soon. See the star of twilight peep O'er yon mountain's dusky steep; Round thy brow thy fillet bind: Love that roves, is ever blind! Soft, perhaps the truant swain Sighs some other nymph to gain:— Gentle urchin, if 'tis so, Let the silly wand'rer go. No, he comes! I own thy skill! Now, let the fates do what they will! STANZAS. [Teach me, love, since thy torments no precepts can cure] Teach me, love, since thy torments no precepts can cure, Since reflection and reason deny me relief; Oh! teach me thy scorn and thy wrongs to endure, While the balm of resentment shall solace my grief. Let my sighs never heave, let my tears never flow, Let the smile of contempt the stern victor defy; For the tear has a charm which no art can bestow, And the language of love is the soul-breathing sigh. Let me shun the proud despot who causes my care, Lest the torture I suffer should feed his disdain; For my tyrant delights in the pang of despair, And the sound which he loves, is the deep groan of pain. I will traverse the desert, climb mountains untrod, Where reflection shall sadden with legions of woes; I will cool my scorch'd brain on the dew-moisten'd sod, While around my torn bosom the loud tempest blows. Yet the mild breath of morning shall bid the storm fly, And the sun's glowing wreath shall encircle the steep; But my bosom shall never forget the deep sigh, Nor my eyes lose their vision that prompts them to weep. Then, oh! where shall I wander in search of repose? Where explore that oblivion that calms the wrung breast,— Since the lover finds sorrow wherever he goes, And the world has for passion no pillow of rest? ANACREONTIC. [You say, my love, the drifted snow] You say, my love, the drifted snow Around our ivy roof is flying; Why, what care I? our bosoms glow, And love still smiles, the storm defying! Love shall no angry tempest fear, Tho' frowning skies the hail may scatter; For still our guardian god is near, Should howling blasts our hovel shatter. Let icy bosoms freeze, while shrill The north-wind blows around our dwelling; Our bosoms know the glowing thrill, And still with melting joys are swelling! The hollow gust that passes by, We scarcely hear, no danger fearing; Yet love's most soft and murmurr'd sigh Shall speak in accents sweetly cheering. Our faggot fire shall brighter blaze, Our bed of down invite to slumber; And, 'till the morn shall spread its rays, Time shall delicious moments number. See the dull flame our taper shows, How faint it burns!—well! let it quiver; The torch of love unwasted glows, And still shall glow as bright as ever! ANACREONTIC. TO BACCHUS. Is it the purple grape that throws A lustre on the sparkling eye? Is it the nectar-draught that glows Upon the lip of ruby dye? Is it the Bacchanalian set That makes old time his scythe forget; And gives the long, long joyous night, To fill the breast with rich delight? Does wine expand the glowing soul? Does friendship weave the magic vine, And strengthen in the magic bowl? Does genius own its pow'r divine? Does science smile, and wisdom find The nectar cup expand the mind? And does the morn's returning light Approve “the long, long joyous night?” If so, thou rosy god! then take My ardent vows, and give to mirth The fleeting hour; for thou can'st make This mortal scene an heav'n on earth! Bring, bring the magic cup, and we Will laugh and chaunt the catch and glee, That all the long and joyous night Our hearts shall glow with rich delight! But if thy purple stream should prove The spell, my finer sense to bind; If it can dim the flame of love, Or chill the source that warms the mind; If reason, Bacchus, flies from thee, I ne'er thy grov'ling slave will be! Nor will I share thy long, long night, Which robs the soul of pure delight. ANACREONTIC. [Bring me the flowing cup, dear boy] Bring me the flowing cup, dear boy, And bring it full; for I Must taste the grateful liquid joy, And bid dull sorrow fly: Bring, bring the sparkling cup divine, And let its bev'rage, sweet, be mine. Not with the purple luscious stream Its crystal sides must glow; Not with a fev'rish restless dream Will with'ring anguish go; Bring me the cup of bev'rage pure, Which shall the wounds of mem'ry cure. Give to the Bacchanalian throng Phœnicia's perfum'd glass, While tipsy revelry and song Greet time, and bid him pass: I ask the goblet—not of wine, I ask the limpid draught divine! Let the hot sun beam give the fruit A bloom of purple hue; Let the pale moon, in silv'ry suit, Scatter nocturnal dew; I to the fountain clear will haste, A healthful crystal cup to taste: And now my fev'rish senses find A calm and soothing rest; Sweet are the visions of my mind, And tranquil is my breast: For 'twas from Lethe's sacred stream I drank farewell to passion's dream! MORNING. ANACREONTIC. The sun now climbs the eastern hill; Awake, my love! thine eyes unclose! Hark! near our hut the limpid rill Calls thee, soft tinkling, from repose! The lark soars high above thy couch of rest; And on the plain the hunter's cries Call echo from the misty skies: Awake, my love! those glances meet, Which promise hours of blisses sweet! The dew-pearls fall from ev'ry flow'r— See how they glitter o'er the heath! While balmy breathings fill the bow'r Where love still sighs with softer breath. 'Tis time to wake, my love! the day On sunny wing flies swift away: Noon will thy velvet cheek annoy, And ev'ning's dews will damp thy joy: Then wake, my love! and ope thine eyes, As bright, as blue, as summer skies! We'll hunt the rein-deer, chase the boar, Thou shalt my Atalanta be! And when our sportive toil is o'er, Venus shall snatch a grace from thee! Young Bacchus shall his ivy band Receive from thy soft snowy hand; And time his scythe aside shall fling, While rosy rapture holds his wing: Then wake, my love! the sun his beam Darts golden on the rapid stream. Thy cheek shall bloom, as Hebe's fair; Thy lip shall steep'd in honey be; The graces shall entwine thy hair; The loves shall weave a zone for thee: Thy feet shall bound across the waste, Like Daphne's by Apollo chas'd; And ev'ry breeze that round thee blows, Shall bring the fragrance of the rose. Then come, my love! thy hours employ No more in dreams—but wake to joy. I hear thy voice, I see those orbs As blue, as brilliant as the day; Thy vermil lip the dew absorbs, And scents thy breath like op'ning May: Upon thy dimpled cheek the hue Of summer's blushing buds I view; And on thy bosom's spotless glow, The whiteness of the mountain snow: Ah! close those eyes again—for see, All nature is eclips'd by thee! MALE FASHIONS FOR 1799. Crops like hedgehogs, high-crown'd hats, Whiskers like Jew Moses; Padded collars, thick cravats, And cheeks as red as roses. Faces painted pink and brown; Waistcoats strip'd and gaudy; Sleeves thrice doubled thick with down, And straps to brace the body. Short great-coats that reach the knees, Boots like French postillion; Worn the G? race to please, But laugh'd at by the million. Square-toed shoes, with silken strings, Pantaloons not fitting; Finger deck'd with wedding rings, And small-clothes made of knitting. Curricles so low, that they Along the ground seem dragging; Hacks that weary half the day In Rotten-row are fagging. Bull-dogs grim, and boxers bold, In noble trains attending; Science which is bought with gold, And flatt'rers vice commending. Hair-cords, and plain rings, to shew Many a lady's favour, Bought by ev'ry vaunting beau, With mischievous endeavour. Such is giddy fashion's son! Such a modern lover! Oh! wou'd their reign had ne'er begun! And may it soon be over! FEMALE FASHIONS FOR 1799. A form, as any taper, fine; A head like half-pint bason; Where golden cords, and bands entwine, As rich as fleece of Jason. A pair of shoulders strong and wide, Like country clown enlisting; Bare arms long dangling by the side, And shoes of ragged listing! Cravats like towels, thick and broad, Long tippets made of bear-skin, Muffs that a Russian might applaud, And rouge to spoil a fair skin. Long petticoats to hide the feet, Silk hose with clocks of scarlet; A load of perfume, sick'ning sweet, Bought of Parisian varlet. A bush of hair, the brow to shade, Sometimes the eyes to cover; A necklace that might be display'd By Otaheitean lover! A bowl of straw to deck the head, Like porringer unmeaning; A bunch of poppies flaming red, With motly ribands streaming. Bare ears on either side the head, Like wood-wild savage satyr; Tinted with deep vermilion red, To shame the blush of nature. Red elbows, gauzy gloves, that add An icy cov'ring merely; A wadded coat, the shape to pad, Like Dutch-women—or nearly. Such is caprice! but, lovely kind! Oh! let each mental feature Proclaim the labour of the mind, And leave your charms to nature. ANACREONTIC. [The day is past! the sultry west] The day is past! the sultry west Its golden curtain closes! My mossy couch is gayly drest With leaves of summer roses— For thee! The day is past! the silv'ry moon Will light the shadowy mountain soon; Then come, my love, let soft delight Give downy wings to fleeting night— With me! The day is past! the rising dews Spangle the meadows over; Where buds retint their faded hues, To greet the wand'ring lover— Like thee! The gossamer its silver thread Winds round the glow-worm's twinkling head; The beetle sounds its drony horn, And pearl-drops all the flow'rs adorn— For me! The purple vine its branches bends, The bow'r of love confining; And there the rosy god attends, An ivy wreath entwining— For thee! The golden goblets foaming round, Seem with impatient streams to bound: Haste, haste, my truant, let thy lip The cup of heav'nly nectar sip— With me! But let not low and base desire Degrade thy bosom's feeling; Let love illume his sacred fire, The light of truth revealing— For thee! Let vulgar, common natures rove In paths of sordid, sensual love; But know, the frozen, grov'ling mind, Nor friend, nor monitor, shall find— In me! STANZAS TO A FRIEND WHO WISHED TO HAVE MY PORTRAIT. E'en from the early days of youth, I've bless'd the sacred voice of truth— And candour is my pride: I always speak what I believe; I know not if I can deceive— Because I never tried. I'm often serious, sometimes gay, Can laugh the fleeting hours away, Or weep for others woe: I'm proud! this fault you cannot blame, Nor does it tinge my cheek with shame: Your friendship made me so. I'm odd, eccentric, fond of ease, Impatient, difficult to please; Ambition fires my breast: Yet, not for wealth or titles vain; Let but the laurel deck my strain, And dulness take the rest. In temper quick, in friendship nice; I doat on genius, shrink from vice, And scorn the flatt'rer's art: With penetrating skill can see, Where, mask'd in sweet simplicity, Lies hid the treach'rous heart. If once betray'd, I scarce forgive; And tho' I pity all that live, And mourn for ev'ry pain, Yet never could I court the great, Or worship fools, whate'er their state; For falsehood I disdain. I'm jealous, for I fondly love; No feeble flame my heart can prove, Caprice ne'er dimm'd its fires: I blush to see the human mind, For nobler, prouder claims design'd, The slave of low desires. Reserv'd in manner, where unknown; A little obstinate, I own, And apt to form opinion; Yet, envy never broke my rest, Nor could self-int'rest bow my breast To folly's base dominion. No gaudy trappings I display, Nor meanly plain, nor idly gay, Yet sway'd by fashion's rule; For singularity, we find, Betrays to ev'ry reasoning mind, The pedant or the fool. I fly the rich, the sordid crowd, The little great, the vulgar proud, The ignorant and base: To sons of genius homage pay, And own their sov'reign right to sway— Lords of the human race. When coxcombs tell me I'm divine, I plainly see the weak design, And mock a tale so common: Howe'er the flatt'ring strain may flow, My faults, alas! too plainly show, I'm but a mortal woman! Such is my portrait now believe; My pencil never can deceive, And know me what I paint. Taught in affliction's rigid school, I act from principle, not rule, No sinner, yet no saint. THE OLD BEGGAR. I Do you see the old beggar who sits at yon gate, With his beard silver'd over like snow? Tho' he smiles as he meets the keen arrows of fate, Still his bosom is wearied with woe. II Many years has he sat at the foot of the hill, Many days seen the summer sun rise; And at evening the traveller passes him still, While the shadows steal over the skies. III In the bleak blast of winter he hobbles along O'er the heath, at the dawning of day; And the dew-drops that freeze the rude thistles among, Are the stars that illumine his way. IV How mild is his aspect, how modest his eye, How meekly his soul bears each wrong! How much does he speak by his eloquent sigh, Tho' no accent is heard from his tongue. V Time was, when this beggar, in martial trim dight, Was as bold as the chief of his throng; When he march'd thro' the storms of the day or the night, And still smil'd as he journey'd along. VI Then his form was athletic, his eyes' vivid glance Spoke the lustre of youth's glowing day! And the village all mark'd, in the combat and dance, The brave younker still valiant as gay. VII When the prize was propos'd, how his footsteps wou'd bound, While the maid of his heart led the throng, While the ribands that circled the May-pole around, Wav'd the trophies of garlands among! VIII But love o'er his bosom triumphantly reign'd, Love taught him in secret to pine; Love wasted his youth, yet he never complain'd, For the silence of love—is divine! IX The dulcet ton'd word, and the plaint of despair, Are no signs of the soul-wasting smart; 'Tis the pride of affection to cherish its care, And to count the quick throbs of the heart. X Amidst the loud din of the battle he stood, Like a lion, undaunted and strong; But the tear of compassion was mingled with blood, When his sword was the first in the throng. XI When the bullet whizz'd by, and his arm bore away, Still he shrunk not, with anguish oppress'd; And when victory shouted the fate of the day, Not a groan check'd the joy of his breast. XII To his dear native shore the poor wand'rer hied; But he came to complete his despair: For the maid of his soul was that morning a bride! And a gay lordly rival was there! XIII From that hour, o'er the world he has wander'd forlorn; But still love his companion would go; And tho' deeply fond memory planted its thorn, Still he silently cherish'd his woe. XIV See him now, while with age and with sorrow oppress'd, He the gate opens slowly, and sighs! See him drop the big tears on his woe-wither'd breast, The big tears that fall fast from his eyes! XV See his habit all tatter'd, his shrivell'd cheek pale; See his locks, waving thin in the air; See his lip is half froze with the sharp cutting gale, And his head, o'er the temples, all bare! XVI His eye-beam no longer in lustre displays The warm sunshine that visits his breast; For deep sunk is its orbit, and darken'd its rays, And he sighs for the grave's silent rest. XVII And his voice is grown feeble, his accent is slow, And he sees not the distant hill's side; And he hears not the breezes of morn as they blow, Nor the streams that soft murmuring glide. XVIII To him all is silent, and mournful, and dim, E'en the seasons pass dreary and slow; For affliction has plac'd its cold fetters on him, And his soul is enamour'd of woe. XIX See the tear, which, imploring, is fearful to roll, Tho' in silence he bows as you stray; 'Tis the eloquent silence which speaks to the soul, 'Tis the star of his slow-setting day! XX Perchance, ere the May-blossoms cheerfully wave, Ere the zephyrs of summer soft sigh; The sun-beams shall dance on the grass o'er his grave, And his journey be mark'd—to the sky. THE END.</field>
