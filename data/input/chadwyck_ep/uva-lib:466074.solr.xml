      <field name="fulltext">TO MY FATHER AND MOTHER</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. A SCULPTOR. “A sculptor!” “He left no work to see!” “A genius!” “Wherein might his genius be?” “A dead man!” “Reverence for the dead Must never blind to the truth,” ye said. There was That within him which was divine; But his soul was its prison, not its shrine; And the fetter'd Thought could never, free, Go forth in its strength and symmetry, Though its prison-walls at its yearning cry Trembled and shook exceedingly.— Alas for the man whom God bids live, And keep what he fain would die to give. Ever with patient hand he sought To give its due to his lovely Thought; And day after day, the story tells, He workt as one whom a god impels. One watcht him ever, with eyes so deep For love that no slumber knew nor sleep: Fair in body and fair in mind, True and patient and strong and kind. The self-same arms had rockt their rest; Their lips had drunk from the self-same breast; And her mother, dying, had pray'd that she Would her foster-brother's keeper be. The woman her life's delight had deem'd To work for him while the waiting seem'd So long and dreary; and, ere 'twas o'er, The wolf might be standing at the door: So, having him thus in her heart, she said The sister should be in the mother's stead. But, seeing that she was fair and young, And knowing the stranger's busy tongue, She pray'd it would please him to confer The shield of a husband's name on her. And three days after the burial, Through a dull rain driving slow and small, Wet ground underfoot, grey sky overhead, They walkt to the church and there were wed. Man and wife, through the chilling rain, They walkt to the sculptor's house again; And the sculptor went upon his way Just with the heart of yesterday, As though, in a kind of somnambulism, A priest had toucht with the sacred chrism The lady given of God to be Supreme in her grace and royalty, And, waking, his brain refus'd to keep The thought of what he had done in sleep. Many a year had past away Since Cecco and Lotta us'd to play Together 'neath that blue sky of theirs, And blest and were blest in their lovely pray'rs:— I think you never would recognise The baby lovers in any wise In the quiet woman who goes to-day Deep-soul'd, deep-eyed, on her daily way, And the thin, dark man who, people say, Is that strange Francesco da Fiesole, Poor fool, who aspires to the artist's meed But none has seen or shall see, indeed, The fruit of the travail of his brain— Thinking and toiling all in vain. Fair was the woman's face, and sweet Her voice, and swift were her noiseless feet, And kind her hands; but her husband knew Full little of her the fair and true. To work when the dawn brake golden-fair; At work when the stars of night shone there: Forwatcht, forwearied at night and worn, Yet eager to meet his work at morn. Sometimes she whisper'd, half in fear, “Rest for a little while, my dear.” But he—“For the soul that God has blest Only in perfect work is rest.” “Yet rest is the truest work sometimes! Out of the silence grow new rimes; Out of the cool where shadows brood Leaps up the soul in its strength renew'd.” Then he smil'd, and the smile said wordlessly, “Woman, what have I to do with thee?” Hours, days, years, swept on, it may be,— Which he knew not and car'd not, he,— Art knows not Time but Eternity— When a wonderful vision, great and sweet, Came in the silence his soul to greet, And, daz'd by the glory's sharp excess, He fell in a deep unconsciousness, With a cry that struck on her ear alone: And the woman found him lying prone, With his head at the base of a block of stone, A shapeless, loveless thing he wrought, A cenotaph of his wondrous thought. She lifted him into the outside air, And its breeze crept in and out of his hair, Touching his face with a light caress, As he lay enwrapt in the silentness. And, just as the day had kiss'd the night, He woke, and, with wide eyes full of light, Lookt up to her face and murmur'd he, “Thank God that at last through the mists I see The star of my life arise on me.” Oh, then the delight of sweet surprise Glow'd in the depths of her tender eyes; And something fairer than laughter lit Her face with a smile most exquisite. But not for her is that gladness deep, And not for her are the words that leap From his spirit's depths—“My glorious Art, Who hast shrin'd thyself within my heart, Pardon the weakness of earth that shrank When the fiery draught of thy life I drank, And teach my spirit to bear the stress And awe of thy terrible loveliness: As when, in the earth-sprung bush there glow'd, And yet consum'd not its frail abode, The awful light of the living God.” He rose with a fresh-nerv'd energy, And a new-born life within his eye— “Oh, deep in my heart of hearts is writ ‘Though the vision tarry, wait for it.’” So, when she brought him a wine-fill'd cup, With flashing eyes he rais'd it up, And dasht the red wine upon the floor, For the strength of his hope sustain'd him more. And, laughing, he said, “the gods will bless My work with an infinite success; For the wine I have here pour'd out shall be Libation paid unto them by me.” But a tear was in the woman's eye, And the thought swept over her mournfully, As she lookt where the red stream slowly flow'd, That its antitype was his heart's best blood. She watcht outside the door all night, Nor went away till the dawn of light; And ceaselessly on her ear there broke The ring of her husband's chisel-stroke. And at dawn when, weary in heart and limb, She carried the morning meal to him, The ground was strewn with fragments white, Where his hand had hewn at the block all night, The block that seem'd to her eyes to grow More shapeless and loveless at every blow. But she saw his eyes as the eyes of a seer, And he spoke, and her heart stood still to hear, “It grows and grows beneath my touch— O Art, thank God that I love thee much! Not in the dull coarse clay will I shrine The thought new-born from this soul of mine— The stately marble's purity At once shall its glorious temple be. The beautiful wonder grows and grows— I carve her as on my sight she rose, Perfection and light the ministers To wait on each motion and look of hers. Ah, no mere lady of perfect mould In her shall the gazer's eye behold; The Godhead's splendour shall surely shine In the lightest curve and the faintest line; And my chisel shall loftily express That Beauty is one with Holiness.” Oh, full on his face, as the woman went, There glow'd the light of supreme content; And silent she left him as, sharp and clear, His chisel clasht on her heart and ear. With quick, lithe step she climb'd the stair To her room that was very bleak and bare, Save that a rich fair robe was spread In mocking splendour upon the bed, Wrought with a delicate broidery Of flower and leaf full daintily. Many and many a weary hour The woman had toil'd over leaf and flow'r, For winner she of the daily bread Wherewith her beloved one was fed. She did not look on the broidery bright That strain'd her eyes far into the night, (Yet Love had made the task seem light) But, panting as if in struggle fierce, She tore off that sombre dress of hers, And once, after years, was fain to free The storm of her passionate agony. But the early light of the morning fair Smote full on a little mirror square, And the woman's eye was caught, and lo! She could not but see the lovely show: The stately throat and the golden hair That fell on the gleaming shoulders bare, And the eyes that glisten'd with all the rush Of tears, and the cheeks with their crimson flush. She lookt and started amaz'd because She saw how exceeding fair she was, And cried with a cry of great despair, “Alas! in vain am I made so fair, For his life is utterly perishing At the feet of that dreadful, shapeless thing Which never can rise, in face or limb To smile back the strength of his love on him. O love, my love, who never wilt know That I, thy wife, have lov'd thee so, I would lie death-doom'd at thy sacred feet To hear thee say but, I love thee, Sweet, Wilt thou not open thine eyes to see How good perfection can never be If Nature and Art, which are its source, Be torn from each other in grim divorce?” Then sudden, with one great, gasping strain, The woman regain'd her calm again, And, when she laid down her work that night, Her eyes were still and her cheek was white, And never a face in the universe More passion-free than that face of hers. And, strong in the love whose wish and want Is good for its darling, not to vaunt Itself as that good's sole ministrant, “Pray God that my husband see,” she said, “The joy of his work accomplished.” But sometimes the woman would sorely grieve, As one who cannot, but would, believe: As one who, in seeking, cannot find, And dares to hope 'tis that he is blind. And sometimes she brooded in dull unrest O'er the knowledge hidden within her breast, How some in visible form have wrought The passion and glory of their thought, While some in their souls, unseen must hold What never in form can be shown or told. The studio's door is open'd wide, And he stands at a veiled statue's side: The door is open'd wide and free, For all may enter who choose and see. As one unto whom the time doth bring The joyful calm of the finishing, He stands by the side of the unseen thing; Stands calm and still with his face uprais'd, As if on some light unseen he gaz'd. His wife in silence holds her place Close, close to him, with that marble face As fair as the vision of perfectness His soul has sobb'd and moan'd to express. Marble-cold and marble-fair; Is she the woman who wrestled there Last night in the agony of prayer? Marble-cold, and marble-pale, She waiteth the loosing of the veil. The veil is loost, and the sculptor's eye Looks round in that moment's ecstasy, With a dumb appeal for sympathy. For, as pain dies down when hearts are there To take and eat of the bitter fare, So joy is half pain if none may share. Still are they all for a little space, And each one gazeth on other's face, Then back to the thing that stands alone, A thought—a work—or a block of stone. A hush—and then, in the murmurs low, She knows what it needeth not she know— A march for the dead beat soft and slow; For the great dead hope and the man who lies With death on his heart and in his eyes. What does it matter, silence or speech? For there, on the height he never might reach, His Thought, unshrin'd in the failure grim, In terrible pathos looks at him. The house is silent, the critics thence Have past with pity and reverence, And the woman is left alone to keep Her watch by the man that God lets sleep. Only once do his lips unclose As he lies on her breast in deep repose: Only the murmur'd name, the dear Pet-name unheard for many a year, Lotta!—the dying man to-day Is Ceccolino again, at play With his little comrade among the flow'rs And hopes and joys of the long-ago hours. “What is the moral?” ye ask me—this I offer, tell me whether it is. The earth all quick with the diamond's soul In its throes oft bears but the formless coal, So close of kin to the perfect gem That is meet for a kingly diadem. “This is no moral! why fail'd the man? Ay, tell me that, if ye only can. Why and wherefore I know not, I, Nor take upon me the mystery Of things, as if I were God's spy. Think ye God answers no or yes To men as they idly guess and guess, “If he had lov'd or if—”?—that If Is God's undecipher'd hieroglyph. TOLD IN THE FIRELIGHT. At last, old friend, after all the years of hope that, deferr'd, doth tire The heart as surely as pain itself, you are sitting here by my fire: 'Twas worth the waiting to find your heart the same as ever still, Though alter'd much is that dear old face since last we met, friend Will. The eyes are as bright as ever they were, but, just about the mouth, The lines, not stern, but tenderly grave, tell something of parted youth: And your step is slower than us'd to be, and bow'd is the stalwart form Which minded us all of a rock that bade defiance to beat of storm: And the waves of care have swept o'er your head, and left, just here and there, A little streak of their silvery foam on the seaweed brown of your hair. But oh! on your face is the sweetness still that oft is wrung out by pain From natures less noble than yours, as the juice is crusht away from the cane. Both of us, Will, have lov'd; each sought, in the Spring of his life, to be The Knight of knights in the gentle eyes of the one belov'd lady: Your dream, old friend, was realiz'd in the gift of your beautiful one— To love her made you exceeding glad, to lose her, exceeding lone. I remember the grace of her movements light, and her voice as soft as the sigh Of wind among summer's full-leav'd trees—she was very fair to die— But I think, such sweetness was on her brow, such pureness on her tongue, She was lov'd with the mystic immortal love they say is death to the young. Hand in hand together we stood on the still September morn While the reapers' sickles rustled like wind against the yellow corn, Hard by the place of your dove's last nest there under the light, loose turf Whose bending grass should never be stirr'd by wind that had moan'd on the surf. We parted soon for a long, long while: you went to the morning land Where Nature spreadeth a daily feast of her lovely things and grand, And the spirit of love and of those sweet songs which lips of the true have sung Watcht o'er you by night and day and kept the harp of your life well-strung, Else how, since grief doth age the heart, can your heart be so fresh and young? My story you ask for, old comrade? Well, you shall have it and welcome too: I could not have told it in letters, I think, but am glad to tell it to you, Face to face and hand to hand this eventide by my fire, Here, as so often I've wanted you with restless, great desire. Is it not strange how the certain hand of Time can utterly smooth Down into calm the passionate storms that trouble the heart of youth? The wine that, in drinking, was bitterest, is mixt in remembrance with myrrh— So, Will, it does not hurt me now to think or to speak of her. Calm on my life's love-threshold she stood, with the forehead smooth and square That gleam'd like a silver star against the drifts of her cloud-like hair; And cheeks too young, too young to be so utterly pale and grave, And lips where delicate pathos lay at the heart of each smile they gave. A still, calm presence that, moonlike, wrought such a passionate tide in my breast, That to me the love which I priz'd so dear was only a name for unrest. My whole life gather'd up at once its trouble and joy and desire, And laid itself down at her feet and pour'd out its strength in words of fire. At first, as she listen'd, those lips of hers that stately were, but mild, Curv'd into a pitying, quiet smile, as if for a wayward child; But soon, with the force of my pleading strong, there came a look in her eyes, As if she were gazing back to the past with its mazes and mysteries. And when I ceast, she droopt her lids, and the few, low words she said Were utter'd so faintly, I only caught the sound of the last one—dead! Then I was dumb, and it seem'd as if a many ages swept Over my life that, trembling there, its sorrowful silence kept. Was it the ghost of her pain or else the wraith of mine that had come And stood, a shadow between us two, in the shadows of evening's gloom? She laid on my arm a kind calm hand, and spoke to me, with the grace Of her womanhood's pitying tenderness soft on her beautiful clear-cut face: Just in the very fewest words and the simplest ones, she told A story old and common enough, and as sad as common and old: Something of poverty—parting—and then the struggle for daily bread In a far-off land, and at last the news that crusht her hope—he was dead. Ah! would that I never had spoken the words that I spoke out then to her Whose love and pain should have been to me the veriest barrier— “Hate me,” I said, “if you will, if you will, so you let me kneel and adore The light that shall be my star of stars for ever and evermore.” Commonplace words enough they sound, but nothing is commonplace To a woman who sees a man's whole heart leap out to her in his face: And her voice was softer than even its wont, and her eyes had tears unshed— “I never shall love again, but yet—if you will, so be it.” she said. Then I fain had drawn her close to the heart that would shelter hers for ever, But she shudder'd, as if with pain or cold, and pray'd of me just to leave her, Leave her a little while; she would strive her woman's duty to do; Well she knew me and trusted me; she call'd me a good man and true; Knew that I lov'd her; but all was strange and new, and the crisis of life Was come unto her who had surely thought she never should be a wife. And we parted then; but all night long, with a weight as heavy as lead, It lay on my heart and haunted me, or waking, or sleeping, —Dead. The days past on and a tender calm that was almost like to peace, Fell on my life from that life of hers and bade its unrest to cease: Her life so full of the duties fair that were order'd smooth and even, To know her was beauty and grace and good, and to love her was very heaven. Yet sometimes, despite, in my heart of hearts, a fathomless longing would rise For storms and sunshine instead of the blue of those fair, untroubled skies; For the delicate hearth-fire to cherish and tend, instead of the distant star; For the beam of the lesser light close by, instead of the greater afar. Well, seeing the time was passing fast in that gentle light and clear, I askt her when should my hope be crown'd, and she pray'd me for a year, And I thought in that year perhaps, perhaps, the waters of time might sweep Lethe-like over her heart and drown all pain in a wakeless sleep. We said we would part for that one year, and I left our country's shore Not to see her again till the time I never should leave her more: But oh! with the look in her quiet eyes there fell a shadow on me, And I thought of the world-sick preacher's words that all is but vanity. The year was over and gone at last, and both of us bound for home; I and another, an artist-friend I had made while I stay'd at Rome. A genial, open-hearted man, who was coming home to claim The right to give to his best-belov'd the gift of the ring and name. He told me more than I told him, Will, but somehow, it seem'd to strike A chill on my heart that our hope should be so like and yet so unlike. He told me about a morning bleak in the time of early snow, When he parted from her, his lady dear, just five long years ago, Knowing not when they should meet again, but strong in the trust and truth That keep the flowers of the heart so fresh in the dew and beauty of youth. Ay, the times change and we with them, but he knew he should find her the same In heart and soul as the last sweet time he had heard her name his name. Never a letter had past between them: her kinsfolk and friends disallow'd The trothplight, for he was poor and young and they were poor and proud. He had struggled hard and overcome by the force of that which gains The crown and the palm—the patient “power of taking infinite pains;” And when, at last, success had come, he had hugg'd with a miser's grasp The gold that was bringing him every day more near to the deathless clasp Of her virgin-hand, and the tender light of her lustrous violet eye For evermore and for evermore—it was wonderful ecstasy. He pac'd the long deck to and fro, and lookt so blest and proud In his love and trust that I know not how I utter'd my thought aloud, With a touch of cynicism that now I think of, Will, with pain, As I said, “But how if you lose, good friend, where you only think to gain?” He stopt his walk and lookt at me with the look of perfect calm That comes to the face when the life is tun'd to the pitch of love's great psalm;— “Ah, yes, I have thought of that before; she may be lying low With violets quick on her dear dead breast; God's will be done, if so; Or else she may have thought me dead, and given herself to one As true and loving as I could be;—to say God's will be done Truly were harder if so it were; in the book of the heart I have read More bitter is grief for the living lost than ever it is for the dead. All's in God's hands; but somehow I feel so strong in my love and trust I think that He will not suffer this hope of mine to crumble to dust. She cannot else be lost I know;—there's a word that Society uses When a frivolous woman plays with a heart as long as her fancy chooses, Then casts the poor plaything away for others to toy with, unless, indeed, It be too much broken for that, and cares not and takes not the slightest heed— Flirting they call it—but she, yes, she is so pure and true and high, As far above that unwomanly shame as a star in its depth of sky, And all that is lofty and beautiful in her is so surely blent, My treasure perhaps may be lost to me, but it cannot have thus been spent.” I had seen her again, my statue-love, she had met me with never a touch Of true-love joyaunce and eager bliss, and my whole soul crav'd for such: I had lookt in vain, in vain, for the crimson beacon of love on her cheek, As a watcher looks with longing eyes to the East for the morning-streak. Tender and meek as of old she was, and I thought “Has she come to forget The Past with its sweetness and bitterness, and will she love me yet?” Such women never forget, albeit, outliving their agony, From their sweet souls is born the grace of infinite charity. We were sitting together one eventide; her hand lay light in mine, The quiet hand that, to-morrow morn, was to wear my marriage-sign: I was reading a quaint old ballad aloud that pleas'd my lady much, When we heard a footstep—an open'd door—and she drew her hand from my touch, And lifted her eyes—and then—O Will!—with a cry, on my heart that rang As a joybell might on a doom'd man's ear who waits for his deat?, she sprang, With a deer-like bound in the eager joy that quiver'd through all her frame To her home on his breast for evermore, and he kiss'd her and nam'd her name. Only a moment thus they stood, forgetting all but the joy Of a love whose infinite sweetness and strength nor time nor pain could destroy, And then she started back from his arms with a glorious crimson glow, Love's banner, flasht out over her face from her chin to her very brow; So was the wonderful loveliness now full-lit by the light of the human, Grown beneath love's true hand at once to the fairest beauty of woman. My heart sent forth a desperate cry as wordless I past from the door, Like the last long wail of one who is drown'd in sight of the ship and the shore. There is the end;—there's a grand old truth that never grows dull or trite, All that God does, and the way He does it, is sure to be wise and right. And I call it nothing but casting reproach on Him and His perfect plan, Who made the love of man for woman, the love of woman for man, When those who have lost that bliss, or those to whom it has been denied, Sneer at the holy name of love and smother with selfish pride The seeds of the sacred flowers God holds to be given in service meet When twin'd for a darling's brow or laid at tir'd humanity's feet. And life has autumn and winter joys left yet, and I love to see Her little children, whom I had hop'd should be mine, around my knee: Ay, give me your hand, old friend, true friend—there was once a tender and true man Like you, who gave to his friend a love passing the love of woman. MARGARET, A MARTYR. The dying man tost from side to side; The nurse stoopt down in the twilight dim, And smooth'd his brow to quiet him: “He may dream of his mother's hand,” she said, “By the touch of mine on his restless head.” But he, with eyeballs staring wide, Clutcht at that gentle hand of hers, And moan'd, “O voice of the sea, the sea! The curse of its voice! the curse! the curse!” The house where he lay was far enough From the roaring and beating of the sea; Far away from the blast, said she, That shrieks on the foam-fleckt crags. But he Answer'd in accents hard and rough, “Woman, I tell you wave on wave Dashes along with a dread white crest, Taking its spoil of my last long rest; I shall hear the sound in my very grave.” Pale was the nurse with wordless fright: All the seeming-endless night She had listen'd thus to his agony— “Terrible, pitiless, ghastly sea! She is drown'd, drown'd, drown'd, I tell you; She: I lov'd and slew her, lov'd and slew! Her eyes were bluer than the blue Of the sea, and truer than the true Of its tide; and I slew her by the sea.” “Is he mad, or does he dream?” thought she. “Forbid it God that true it be.” “You don't believe, or you half believe? I am quite calm now: will you listen to me? Think you are going to receive My last confession—is that the phrase?— I'm telling you now because the day's Adawn and I'm wearied out with pain, And I think it must all be o'er at night. No secret, child: it's ten years quite Since I stood in the dock and they maunder'd on, And said I was mad; and they shut me up In a madhouse, not to come out again Till her Majesty's pleasure—Give me the cup— That's good—thanks, thanks; but, five years gone, They sent me out on my pleasant way, Old, and wrinkled, and bent, and gray; (But I'm only forty, Nurse, to-day!) And every one's dead—there were only two To die, two only, Maggie and Hugh.” Soft she said, “Let the dead past go! God is tender and good, we know; And it says in the Book, more white than snow The blackest soul may be again; That Blood blots out of blood the stain.” “Poor little nurse-evangelist!” He said, with a lip-curve sadder to see Than eyes all veil'd in thick tear-mist, “No good in preaching like that to me. “‘Why did I moan all through the night?’” 'Twas a kind of physical need to moan And talk of the sea and her, that's all: But I'm not a penitent, to delight Your good lean priest, and have him fall On his knees a-thanking God: I groan And sigh and shudder, from weakness, Nurse, And not from penitence or remorse. Hugh and I were early reft Of the good gold, parents' love, and left To struggle on as best we might, Win or fail in the great life-fight. How could he fail? He workt and plann'd, True of heart and true of hand; Builder and architect, so he. He us'd to laugh and say to me 'Twas I must write the family name High on the walls of the Temple of Fame. I was a painter; one of those Who were seal'd of the tribe pre-Raphaelite: He thought me the greatest of the lot: “Did any one else?” Well, I suppose, Not many set me on such a height As Hugh and she—but it matters not. Hugh was one of your grandly made Fellows, all strength of body and mind; Tall and broad, none could make him afraid; With a powerful arm and a manful tread, And a heart that was kin to all mankind. She—well, she was shy as sweet, And, because she lov'd my brother, not me, Would look not up at the sound of his feet, But blush till she grew thrice fair to see, A crimson blush that pal'd at tip Of her wonderful little delicate ears To the tender pink the young dawn wears: And then she would talk to me and laugh The loveliest laughter, till I went half Mad for her love, and had let all slip, All that I ever had deem'd of worth, Anywhere, everywhere, Heaven or Earth, For the light of her eye and the smile of her lip. I can be just now and analyse It all; look on with another's eyes, And see how Maggie Rivers thought She might be just a sister to me, Because as a lover she lov'd me not— Maggie! Maggie! the sea! the sea! The white waves howl and leap around me! I'm a fool, Nurse—there—so let me be. Hugh came to me one day and said, “Evan, Maggie has promist to be The nearest of all the world to me.” And I lookt up with a sick white smile— “Joy to you, my brother!” while My heart for a moment felt like dead. But life came back with the horrible feel Of a million little pricks of steel; And then one awful grip of pain Caught me, and made me mad, mad, mad— That is the thing they call'd me when I stood in the dock before those men— But, that day, I heard the myriad Spring-sounds upon the delicate air That was round the martlet's procreant nest, And I saw the sights that, everywhere, Made up one sight of beauty; and, blest I saw my brother standing there With the head of the Spring-goddess on his breast; And he was the Spring-god, and all was fair. Should I remember if I had been mad? Should I remember? There's the test. He said—what was it he said?—I know— “Brother and sister,”—and, in the glow Of beauty, hers and his, when he bade, She lifted her lips to mine, and I took Their joy that once, and the whole earth shook And reel'd, and I stood there, blind, deaf, dumb, Only knowing a belt of fire Was round my heart, and hell was come In the heaven that was my soul's desire.” He ceast a moment and, in the lull, Came over the nurse a wonderful Horror and shuddering as, all amaz'd, Upward her frighted eyes she rais'd. And from the sick man's lips a half Sob came that was like a birth-chok'd laugh. Then said she, “Let me pray, for the pow'r Of the Evil One is on you this hour.” Then roll'd out the sneer-set words of his, With a terrible mocking emphasis; “Don't you know it's the fashion to call it a lie, The evil's personality? A dream of the foolish times mediæval To cross and cry for fear of the devil? What is it then? an essence? a thread From a queer kind of loom, that, wov'n in your stuff, Will warp it and spoil it?—That's enough. Perhaps I shall know to-night—well said— Absurd polemics, good Nurse! pshaw! You look at me with a grim white awe In your face. What care I? Not a straw. I can meet this death—must—face to face.” But the nurse, as she strove in vain to chase The horror back from her eyes to her heart, Said, with an irrepressible moan, “Oh, keep your story for God alone!” “God!” said he, as he jerkt apart Her hands, pray'r-claspt unconsciously, “What have I got with God to do? I mean the story only for you. Sit there still and listen to me. A full month's time was yet to be Ere she came, array'd in bridal trim, To make the house a home for him;— Do you hear it now? Will you hear that sea? I was a painter: I told you this? Well, how I painted my masterpiece Is yet to be told. Did I paint it, though, Or only sketch it? I hardly know; I think it was painted: wasn't the gown Short, scant-folded, of russet brown? What does it matter? leave it so. You know the story of Margaret, The girl who hugg'd the Covenant Close to her heart and died—and yet What did she die for? Truth or Cant? My Margaret—no, not Maggie, no— But Margaret Wilson, mine, I say, Not Scotland's Margaret, nor History's, she Who came,—was it in a dream?—to me, With a steady step, in the early glow Of her young life's just unfolden May; She died for Truth, or died to be true— That's better, I think; and Maggie too, She died—was that for the Covenant?— No, I'll not stop; my brain is clear Though they call'd me mad—but—things that haunt— Maggie, Margaret,—Nurse, you shall hear. They drest her up one party night In a Scotch girl's dress and fetcht a stake And bound her, waist, wrists, ankles, tight: And she lookt a Martyr for Truth's sake. And this was done for the brief delight Of folk who had come to merrymake. But she—did the ghost of the dead Scotch girl Come back to earth for a little space, And shine through the flesh of Maggie's face, And tell us that evil were vain to unfurl The flag? or did That for which men die Or live, look out through that body of hers? I know not; I only knew 'twas I Must shew her thus to the universe. A three-hours' ride from where we dwelt The sea beat high upon a shore Where, stark and strong like giants of yore, Rose the great rocks the sea would pelt With foam in its grim horse-play, or roar At the foot of, until one, gazing, felt A desperate wish to leap to its breast And ride, or be tost, on its mighty crest. Often I us'd to visit that beach And look and think, until it seem'd My Margaret Wilson stood there too, She and I, and never a word of speech Upon my lips or hers; and the blue Great sky was above, and, underneath Our feet was—was it the sea or death? And the wild gulls flapt their wings and scream'd, And the sea came up and toucht her feet; And I saw them come to her and urge— What? the pity of it? the dear life's sweet? And I saw them go and the sweeping surge Swirl round her limbs and then retreat; And again and again they offer'd—what? Life? It was Life the girl had got. And the sea came up with no rebuke From the lips of any thaumaturge, And swept her into heaven— I look And see a face a moment bare From the glaucous depths, and I see the hair Float out like trails of the brown sea-weed. Am I mad, mad, mad? No, Nurse, indeed: ‘My pulse as temperately as yours Doth beat.’—That's Hamlet, Hamlet the Dane With a bee in his bonnet; so, that's plain.— Now, if I only could have a weed And a man to talk with—that's what cures. Madness! Death's coming up like the tide, And pity it were to miss the end Of a grand sensational tale because The man who was telling the tale, my friend, Let his jaw drop, eyes stare, and died— So much for Buckingham—That's where I was. We came down to this beach, we two; Maggie, not Margaret, Maggie and I, Hugh's Maggie, who was to sit to me For my picture's sketch by the old gray sea; The picture that should proclaim me him Who had read God's runes and writ them for men In language that whoso ran might read, Clear and plain, not vague and dim. What shall be the rune-reader's meed? I tied her fast to the stake I had set; I bound her, ankles, and wrists, and waist; And the evil tide was far, far out, It would not turn for a good while yet. The low little rocks were slimy and green, And the ugly barnacles could taste The air that was blowing light about Her snood-bound hair: I lookt, and lost Myself in a sort of maze between Sea and sky; it was strange, so lone a place, So drear and wild, on the English coast. You never saw a human face Down there, nor heard a human voice; Though folk in search of the picturesque Might have here found plenty whereat to rejoice And set forth, somehow, at easel or desk. The waves went curling and rippling light; But a voice was singing under their foam, Their laugh-like, delicate, cresting foam, The psalm-tune—you know it—Martyrdom— The grand old psalm-tune, Martyrdom. She stood and mov'd not: the little white Clouds tost in the sky like the blue sea's foam. I said, ‘You are mine now, death's or mine; Love and wife.’ And she lookt at me To understand; and I told her all, Saying, ‘Take your choice, my heart or the sea. Choose and quickly; no use to call, For none will hear. Is it I or the brine, The bitter, deadly glaucous brine?’ Brevity is the soul of wit; Why should I make my story long? I know the tide came swift and strong; I know no man could fight with it, And what could a fetter'd woman do? Lie and say, ‘I promise you All you wish if you set me free?’ Or lie to Hugh and God for me? That? She lie? Do martyrs so? Just one exceeding bitter cry Went from her lips, and then she grew Quite still, and settled herself to die. The air was warm, the sky was blue, And, at first, the sea rose calm and slow. The shore stretcht out in a headland small, A ‘beaked promontory’ small, Whereon if I stood, I could see her plain. I climb'd the place: I recall the pain As I struck my knee against a stone,— Should I remember that at all Had I been mad?—The place was o'ergrown With stubbed heather soft that felt. I sat me down and lookt. A belt Of sea had cover'd the barnacles, And I saw no green slime now; and bells, Church-bells, I think, were in my ear. And she was there, and her face shone clear As a star within the grisly blue, And her little snood was loost, and brown Bright hair was all about her—I knew And saw, and I left her there to drown. What is it someone somewhere saith About being faithful unto death? Well—well—the native savagery Of the sea—I told you here the sea Was wild and strong?—awoke at last, And a little tempest sang i' the blast, And grew to a wild roar presently. And—I saw only the fierce big sea, With a trail of weed upon its breast; And heard the waters moan and roar, And the cry of the gulls upon the shore; And I saw the sun slope to the west, Saw it or felt—Let be, let be.” THE STORY OF ARGALUS AND PARTHENIA. A Transcript from the Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, Book I. When the good king, Basilius, come to years More than decaying, (he was king of all Arcadia) took Gynecia to his wife, Came with her a young lord nam'd Argalus, Who was her cousin-german; thither led By honour partly and the love of her, And partly by the humour of youth, which aye Thinks that is good whose good he doth not see. And in that lord he won so great increase Of knowledge that, when years were spent, he shew'd In all his actions such a virtuous mind, He was Arcadia's glory: a gentleman Rarely accomplisht, excellently learn'd, Without vain-glory; valiant too—the earth Holds not a man that hath perform'd more acts Heroical than he; for valour of mind And strength of body, none to him preferr'd, If any equall'd; yet so valiant that To none he ever durst do injury. In 'haviour surely sober, ever wise, To musing somewhat giv'n, but ne'er uncourteous; His word led by his thought and follow'd of His deed; more liberal than magnificent. In sum, I say, such man was Argalus, The nicest eye could find no spot in him, Unless the over-vehement constancy Of spotless love be counted for a spot. The young lord Clitiphon, the king's sister's son, (His mother married with good lord Kalander) Haunted the company of Argalus More than of any other, and between These twain a liking and a friendliness Sprang up and brought forth this that you shall hear. It fell upon a time that Clitiphon Brought Argalus to a great lady's house— His father's sister's house he brought him to— Who had one child, Parthenia; fair indeed, And fairer much her fairness was, ywis, Seeing 'twas but a fair ambassador Of a fair mind exceeding, full of wit Which better lov'd to judge itself than shew, Her speech being rare as precious, and her silence No sullenness, her modesty sincere, And her shamefastness without ignorance. In sum, if you would praise her, first set down What is it to be excellent; this is she. Now these perfections meeting could not choose But find each other and delight in that They found; likeness of manners surely will Draw liking with affection; nor, indeed, Do actions always cross with reason; in short, They lov'd, though, for a while, the fire of Love, Hope's fanning wings cut off, was blown for them With a wild wind even by Despair himself. Long while Demagoras had woo'd the maid; A suitor mighty in wealth and pow'r, and proud Thereof, and stout, who, save himself, lov'd none. (He lov'd her for the sake of self-delight.) And, following vehemently his desire, His riches gilding over all his faults, Parthenia's mother gave him her consent, And, using with her child authority, Had made her yield thereunto: not because She lik'd that choice, but her obedient mind Not yet had taken on it to make a choice. And now the assurance-day drew very near, When my lord Clitiphon brought Argalus, Perchance that he might see so rare a sight As she by all well-judging eyes was judg'd. But though few days before the assurance-time Appointed were to pass, yet Love, who saw He had a journey very great to make Within a time so short, so hasted him, That, ere her word could to Demagoras Tie her, her heart vow'd her to Argalus, And he fear'd nothing but the missing her, As she desir'd o'er all the having him. And when the time came that Demagoras, Full of proud joy, thought to receive the gift Of her sweet self, she, very resolute, Yet grieving that she must refuse, said thus, She rather would be bedded in her grave Than wedded to the lord Demagoras. And strange unto her mother seem'd the change, Strange as unpleasing, and all ways she tried That ever mother hard of heart could use Upon a humble child in whom the one Resisting pow'r was love: but yet, the more The maid defended did the mother grow Obstinate in assault; and, finding now That Argalus, standing between, eclipst Parthenia's shining from Demagoras, She sought by all means to be rid of him, Employing him in dangerous enterprise As ever step-dame Juno Hercules. But, as she tried his virtue, purer still It grew, and all things done to overthrow His virtue set him up on honour's highth. Yet struggling, seeing she would have her will, And shew authority, as Argalus grew In virtue and strength she hated him the more, Thinking his conquest only conquer'd her; And therefore, still employ'd him in attempts, More and more dangerous, and, the meanwhile, Using all possible extremities On her fair child, that she might make her give Herself to her direction. Hard to judge If he in doing, or she in suffering, Shew'd forth affection's greater constancy; For rather did the world occasions want Than Argalus the heart to go through them: So with Parthenia; malice sooner ceast Than her unchanged patience. Then, in sooth, By treason foul Demagoras and the dame Would fain have made away with Argalus, But he, with courage and with providence So past o'er all, she took a spiteful grief, And her heart brake withal and so she died. But now Demagoras assur'd himself Parthenia free would ne'er be bound to him; And, hearing thus much from her steadfast lips, He, not more wishing his own happiness Than envying Argalus, whom, with narrow eyes He saw e'en ready to enjoy the bliss Of full desire, so strengthen'd his conceit With all the mischievous counsels love disdain'd And envious pride could give: and so the wretch, Taking the time when Argalus was gone Hence to his country, gone to fetch his friends For honouring of the marriage, (her consent Joyfully given thereto), the wretch, I say, Desiring privily to speak with her, With force unmerciful, her too weak arms In vain resisting, rubb'd upon her face A horrible poison, the effect whereof Was never leper lookt more foul than she. This coming unto Clitiphon's father's ears, The good old Kalander of famous name, Her uncle, he made such means Demagoras Was banisht from the land on pain of death. Who, hating the punishment where the fault he should Have hated, join'd himself with all his pow'r Unto the Helots, rebels 'gainst the State; And they, right glad to have among them one Of such authority, made him general; And under him these Helots did commit The most outrageous villainies a base herd In desperate revenge can think or do. But in a little space came Argalus back, Poor gentleman! having within his heart Her image fair, and promising his eyes The uttermost of their felicity, When they—none other dar'd to tell it him— Were the first messengers of their own woe. And who can tell the grief of both of them When he did know her? At the first, indeed, He knew her not, and neither, at the first, Could knowledge possibly have virtue's aid So ready as not faintly to lament The loss of such a jewel; so much the more That skilful men sadly assured them 'Twas past the healing: but, within a while, His truth of love and virtuous constancy Shining through foulest mists took such full hold Of Argalus, he began to comfort her With comforts such as witty arguments May give adversity; nor only this, But with the most abundant kindness that Eye-ravisht lover can express, he sought To drive extremity of grief from her, And hasten on the time of marriage; and Thereunto not less earnest cheerfully Than if she were not disinherited Of that most goodly portion liberally Bequeath'd by Nature; for that cause deferr'd His purpos'd vengeance on Demagoras, So he might keep continually with her: Shewing more humble serviceableness And joy to please her now than e'er before. But even as he gave this example rare, Not to be hoped for again unless There might arise another Argalus, So did Parthenia take as strange a course: For, though she more desir'd his love than life, She overcame her own desire and his, And in no sort would yield to marry him. And strange that he, by an affection sprung Even from excessive beauty, should delight Thus in such horrible foulness; and that she, Of vehement desire to have him, should Yet kindly thus a resolution build Never to have him: for the truth it is She lov'd him so she could not find in heart To tie him down to an unworthy thing. He conjur'd her by memory of her love, And all true oaths of his affection true, She would not make him so unblest to think That with her face he had also lost her heart. He told her, at its fairest, that her face Had but a marshal been, to lodge her love Within his mind, which now was plac'd so well It needed not an outward harbinger: Beseeching her, with very tears, to know That not so superficial was his love To go no deeper than the skin, which yet, Since it was hers, to him was very fair. How could he, thus ungrateful, love her less For that which for his sake she had endur'd? He ne'er beheld it but he saw therein The loveliness of her great love toward him. Protesting unto her he would not take Joy of his life an 'twere not joy of her. But she made answer, wringing of his hand; “My lord, God knows I love you;” did she say. “If I were princess of the whole wide world, And had all blessings e'er the hour brought forth, I would not make delay to lay myself And them beneath your feet; or, if I had Remain'd but as I was, though, I confess, Unworthy far of you, I would with joy Too great for my heart now to look upon, Have taken your vouchsafing me to take, And all defects with faith and love supplied. But let me be more miserable than now, Much more, much more, ere I match Argalus To such Parthenia. No; live happy, Dear; I give you back in full your liberty, And I beseech of you to take the gift, And I assure you that I shall rejoice Whatever I be, to see you coupled so As for your honour and your joy is best.” With that she burst out crying and weeping sore, Not able longer to contain herself, Blaming her fate and wishing she were dead. But Argalus, with a most heavy heart, Pursuing his desire, she, fixt of mind To avoid entreaty, fly all company, Ay, even his, did steal away one night, But whither no man knew. He sought her long In many places, until wanhope came Upon his heart, and he grew weary of life. But now, determining to be aveng'd Upon Demagoras, he went alone, Disguis'd, to the chief town the Helots held; Where, coming into his presence, guarded round By many soldiers, he could not delay His fury longer for a fitter time, But setting on him there despite of those That helpt him, gave him many mortal wounds. And he himself had perisht presently But that Demagoras order'd he be kept Alive, perchance with the intent to feed His eyes with cruel persecution laid On him; but death came sooner than he thought; And his successor kept Argalus alive, To wait for death till ending of the war. Now strange events fell out which brought the war To a quick issue, and Argalus was freed; Who caring little, Parthenia being lost, Whether he liv'd or died, went on his way And sojourn'd at the house of Kalander. And there was merry-making in the house, Where all men, saving Argalus alone, Shew'd forth in joyful eyes their joyful hearts. Then fortune who, belike, was bid to the feast, And meant to play the Goodfellow thereat, Among them did a pleasant adventure bring. As they had newly din'd, a messenger Came unto Kalander, who brought him word A noble lady, kinswoman to the queen Of Corinth, was come thither and desir'd A lodging in his house; and Kalander Went out to meet her, all his worthiest guests With him, save Argalus, who remain'd alone Within his chamber, thinking of his love, Wishing the company were broken up, That he might make his solitary quest. But, when they met the lady, Kalander Thought straightway it had surely been his niece, And would have spoken in familiar kind. But she, in grave and honourable sort, Gave him to understand that he mistook; And Kalander, half asham'd, excus'd himself With the exceeding likeness that she bore Unto Parthenia, though indeed it seem'd That, of the two, this lady had the more Dainty and pure conplexion; and she said It very well might be, because they two Were taken, one for other, many times. But, soon as she was brought into the house, Ere she would rest her, she desir'd to speak With Argalus in public, who, she heard, Was in the house, and he came forth in haste, And thought in haste as Kalander had thought, With sudden change of joy to grief: but she, When she had staid their thought by telling them Her name and quality, spake on this sort. “Lord Argalus,” she said, “late being left At Helen's court, the Queen of Corinth, chief During her absence, she being gone thence For some occasion, came there unto me Parthenia, so disfigur'd that, I think, Greece hath not anything more foul to shew. Some vehement oaths it took, yea, and good proofs Ere she could make me think that it was she: Yet, finding certainly that she it was, And pitying her greatly, all the more That men had told me, even as you do now, Of that great likeness which between us is, I took the dearest care I could of her, And understood the woful history Of her adventure; ay, and therewithal, Of that most noble constancy in you, Lord Argalus, which, whoso loveth not, He sheweth him a hater of all good, Ay, and unworthy with mankind to live. But naught of outward cherishing could salve Her inward sore: a few days since she died. But, ere she died, Parthenia earnestly Desir'd me and persuaded that of none As husband I should think, saving of you, The one man that was worthy to be lov'd. Withal she bade me give this ring to you, Desiring, and, by love's authority, Commanding you to turn that love to me Which you had borne to her; assuring you Nothing there is can please her spirit more Than to behold us twain together matcht. And now, my lord, albeit this office I take Upon me be not suitable to me, In sex or in estate, seeing my sex Should rather look to be desir'd, yet, sooth, Desert uncommon claims uncommon deed: And therefore I am come with faithful love Built on your worthiness, to offer you Myself, and to beseech you to accept The offer; and, if these noble gentlemen Here present, say it is great folly, yet Let them withal say that it is great love.” With that she staid, attending earnestly The answer Argalus should make; who, first Heaving most hearty sighs, the obsequies Of his Parthenia, answered thus to her. “Madam, I am infinitely bound to you For not less rare than noble courtesy, And infinitely bound because of that Sweet kindness I perceive you shew'd to her;” (With that the tears ran down his face, but yet He follow'd on, she listening grave,) “and just As much as so unfortunate a man, Fit to be spectacle of misery, Can do you service, here you may be sure That you have made a purchase of a slave Who, while I live, shall never fail you at need. But this great matter you propose to me, Wherein I am not so blind as not to see What happiness 'twould be—O excellent Lady, if but my heart were mine to give, You should possess it before anyone; But it is dead Parthenia's: there began All matter of affection and there ends. I hope not long to tarry after her With whose good beauty only had I been In love, I should be now with you who have The same; but 'twas Parthenia's self I lov'd And love; which never likeness can make one; Which no commandment ever can dissolve; Which never any foulness can defile; Which never any death can bring to end.” “And must I bear disgrace to be refus'd?” Said she. But he, “Nay, use not that hard word, Who know your own exceeding worthiness, Far above my desert: I but refuse Happiness, since the only happiness I could or can desire, I am refus'd.” But scarcely had he said these words than she Ran unto him and fell upon his neck; “Why, then, take thy Parthenia, Argalus!” And there she stood, Parthenia's very self. Then, seeing grief forbade him to believe, She told him all the truth with circumstance; How, being gone away, meaning to die, Moaning aloud in solitary place, Helen, the Queen of Corinth, passing by, Walking alone, heard her and never left Till she had heard the whole of her discourse; And, pitying her greatly, Helen sent A skill'd physician of her own, in hope That he could help her; which he well perform'd In that same sort they saw. Then she, with her Taking of the queen's servants, thought to make This trial, whether Argalus would yet Quickly forget his true Parthenia or no. And Helen's servants well confirm'd her speech, And Argalus believ'd what he desir'd More than ten thousand years of mortal life; And so the wedding-feast was made for them. TO ANNIE. Springtime, Love! how short a time it seems since the snow and frost, And the mist thick-falling over the hills and the daylight early lost; The strong keen wind and the short-liv'd sun and the cosy household blaze, And you, bright-fac'd and sober-gown'd, all pleasant and sweet to my gaze, With your gracious wisdom calm beneath your pretty childly ways. Ay, it was just a month, a month, I lost the count of, Dear; That's how the beautiful summer-time has suddenly come so near; It seems as it were but yesterday the doctor stood close by With the face so grave it needed not to tell me that I must die: Yes, Love, I could say, “God's will be done!” but, to see you standing there With the agony stampt upon your face and your hands close-claspt in pray'r! Poor little wife! as he left the room you follow'd him and I saw When you came again that your eyes were dim, and a kind of quiet awe Was on your face as you drew quite close and kiss'd my poor parcht mouth With kisses that fell as sweet as rain on the heart of a summer's drouth. Are the tears springing again at the thought? from joy, not sorrow, they come: Yes, we are glad, Dear, you and I, that I stay for a while in this home: And, full of its happy thankfulness and laughter and love, the heart, Instead of learning a service strange, takes up its familiar part. I am very glad it is spring-time now, for I seem to understand New things as I breathe the happy breath of the new-awaken'd land: New things, nay, rather old things new in the light which fair doth fall Upon my heart from the presence-room of the Father who giveth all. I hear the bleat of the yeanling lamb and I smell the new-turn'd earth, The smell of the fields the Lord will bless in the harvest's time of mirth. The glow of life is on my cheek and the common air is good, And the hunger awakes to be satisfied with the taste of common food. Turn your chair round a wee bit, Dear: so—that is the very place— Put down your work and give me your hand and let me look in your face. I want to tell you how, all the time that death was standing near, I could not think of the parting-hour as I watcht you sitting here: My thoughts turn'd back to the fair first time that ever I saw you, Dear. The night-lamp's light was burning low, and all so quiet, except For the feeble tick of the cover'd watch, that you thought I surely slept: But my spirit was with the long-ago crown'd by the face that arose on me Lustrous and pure in the silence fair that brooded o'er shore and sea. You had flung off your gypsy hat for heat, and the sunset's golden red Tremulous play'd with its sister-tint upon your bended head: And your eyes were bow'd to that page of his who was king of your spirit then, And your face mobile with the worded thoughts of Shake-spere's women and men. Your father call'd you to greet his friend who had come to your home that night, And you rose from your seat on the sand with a smile that was, oh! so frank and bright. Welcome Home! and the soft little hand unjewell'd to mine was given— Welcome Home! and my home was there that beautiful quiet even. Home, home, home, sweet home! at last, in the own country, The sparrow might build herself an house, the swallow at rest might be. All the night long your lovely face was the star of stars that lit My soul and banisht the heavy clouds that grief had flung over it: All the night long: and when light made glad the heart of the rathe young hours, I heard you singing a carol blithe as you tended your birds and flowers. And day after day I knew your home, and walkt, a friend, by your side, Till I surely knew that for your sweet sake I would gladly even have died; Annie, our Annie, they call'd you, and I was wild for the right divine To hold you fast in my heart and say My Annie, and only mine. But the happy dream was broken up, for was it not mad and wild, For I was a man of your father's age and you were almost a child? Over and over I said to myself, ah, fool, but what would it be To bind the sapling lithe and young to the many-ring'd, wind-bow'd tree? And in my heart there arose a cry that, no matter at what fierce stress, The angel of love might trample down the dragon of selfishness. It were best, I thought, I should leave your home, though it were so hard to seek The life unlit by the rosy dawn that was bright on your lips and cheek; And I could not bear to look in your face and think how cold and dull The world-mists would beat on my heart bereft of its bright and beautiful. No, little hand, you shall not shut my lips with your tender touch; Just let a sick man have his way who loves to chatter so much; Was it a tear that fell just then, a tear to be kiss'd away?— Little coy darling of mine, look up, and suffer me say my say. You never should know, I said to myself, of the love that yearn'd to entwine Its branches of strength around your heart and bind it fast to mine; So I came to bid you a last goodbye, and I kiss'd your little hand, But you drew it sharply away from my lips, and I dar'd not understand Why, for a moment, you bow'd your face, and then, with a deepen'd glow, And a half-reproach in your eyes' sweet depths, you askt me why I must go. I only said that so it must be, and quietly turn'd away; But there broke on my ear a voice, your voice, that bore me the one word Stay. I turn'd me, Annie, and lookt in your face that was bright with the quick young blood, And the eyes bedimm'd with the tears that sprang from your tender womanhood; And I saw that you knew my secret then, yet fear'd that you might have given Pity for Love, and I would not take aught less than Heaven for my Heaven. “Good-bye, sweet Annie, good-bye, I will not dwell on what might have been— It cannot be, that is all, my child: Good-bye, little household queen; The locks that were wont to be bronze sometime are turning to silver now—” And your eyes, for a moment's space, dear heart, were lifted to scan my brow— And few were the low-ton'd words that brought such joy-wealth—” It may be The bronze of youth is ruddy and fair—this silver is most to me.” O my true wife, the gem that hour is set in remembrance-gold; It fooded my heart with a perfect joy whose glory can never be told: And day by day there grew on your face the look of great content Which told me your happiness indeed with me and mine was blent: Ay, I was glad for that good gift the Father of lights had sent. We have been very happy, Dear, through all these wedded years; In pleasant places our lot was cast, that, not with the terror of tears, But the mist of compassion and tender thought from barrenness were kept, While golden hours span swiftly round and the spirit of sorrow slept. And oh! for a keener eye to see and a keener ear to hear, And swifter feet and tenderer hands and love more large and clear: And oh! to be kept in the perfect peace earth gives not nor can destroy, Until we twain at the last shall come to our God's eternal joy. CALLIMACHUS: A SKETCH. Lo, when my master lay a-dying, I Alone, he chose, should wait to see him die. Soft, fine, and bright, even as web at morn, Hung round his brow his locks: that brow had borne Much weight of thinking, and the close, grave mouth Had never curv'd it to the smile that groweth Of mere light-heartedness. He lay with eyes Undimm'd of age turn'd full to the sunrise; And thus he spake in slow tones thrillingly, Scarce to himself, and scarce, methinks, to me. “The earth is older now by fifty years With all their joy and sorrow and smiles and tears, Since I, a young man, saw my future rise From the sun's bed, upon my eager eyes, With slow, symmetric movements gliding on: And in her curved palms I saw anon, Or seem'd to see, life, work, and crown in one. Yet was her face hid wholly from my sight, Veil'd with a veil of chrysochromal light. Thus to my heart my heart—‘The grace to thee Upon those mute lips' veil'd sublimity, Is the shaper's hand with the seer's eye to see.’ Yea, with these eyes of mine I saw it pass, The pageant of life's mystery that was. Groups of old warriors rose from their death-mist; Lips smil'd that funeral-fires long since had kiss'd; Brows that were calm'd of dreamless sleep, again Took their old fierceness, resting limbs their strain. Deeper the wonder grew, diviner still, Glow'd the Immortals' track on slope and hill. There, where the sky stoopt down the earth to meet, It was the rapture of Phœbus' parting feet Mellow'd the blue and scarlet colours slow Into the quivering amethystine glow. It was the breath of loving Dryades Stirr'd all the leafage of the happy trees. Lo, in that glory of my days I saw A maiden standing, with a shadowy awe Upon her face that mockt her brows' bright wreath As with the heavy dusk of coming death; While stern-fac'd men stood waiting till the knife Should drink with cold blue lips her crimson life. Then, with the heat upon me, I essay'd To paint the picture.— When aside I laid My brush, I knew full well that none would see In that false picture what was seen of me. And, though the many did, with partial eyes, Praise it as beautiful and true, more wise To mine own condemnation, lifted I My hands against that work that was a lie. Those eyes of Zeus had burn'd into my brain, And better light than joy, though light be pain; Yea, Beauty, to my deeming, is in sooth Bastard that springs not from the womb of Truth. Years did I toil in patience: grew a face Upon my canvas, wherein I sought to trace His woe, by the strong victors' pitiless might Crusht into silence, smitten into night. The dead wreath fallen from his loosen'd hair, The hands dropt listless in his dumb despair. Look, O mine eyes and gaze, and see in this The very self-same stricken Thamyris!— A little doubt that rose flood-high, and swept My hope away! I bow'd my face and wept, As he might weep whom Time not yet may rob Of the child-right to lift his voice and sob. Again, more old, more sad, I paus'd to see A work that was conceiv'd and born of me. The mortal maid the Immortal God must slay With splendour, waiting for the hour o' the day The God who stoopt to love her should arise In all his unveil'd glory on her eyes. O soul in the eager eyes and quivering lips! O transport of the near Apocalypse! ‘Is this the picture that thy soul did see? Nay.—Let it perish unbelov'd of thee!’ Well, I was stronger now; perhaps because The great white Truth had kiss'd my brows, it was: And, though there throbb'd through every nerve and sense The agony of conscious impotence, I, loving Truth beyond all hope, all fame, Gave all my pictures to the heart o' the flame, And—waited. A little while ago there came A light I knew to be the morning star; I felt its thrills of tremulous sweetness afar, And rose with happy tears upon my cheek— Then first I knew that I was old and weak— And follow'd, faltering, toward the blessed light, While one walkt with me, stately, tall, and bright, Who smote upon a lyre, and keen and strong Uprose the subtle sweetness of his song. I think I must have swoon'd in my delight, For, when I knew to speak and see, the white Folds of his undefiled robe were gone, And I was lying on the ground alone, Fever and strife and weariness all ceast In that fixt solemn gaze upon the East. And I am well content; the mystery Is open now, or my brain clear'd to see How from my seeming failure's bitterness I shall, in unborn ages, reap success: Not in myself, a man of men, indeed, But in the man, one day to take his meed As victor from the breast of Time, superb In virile strength that needs nor spur nor curb. O life! O art! I know that I am pure From treason, having chosen to endure Rather the most exceeding pain than show Shadow for light; I joy that it was so. Hush! the ascending sun! mine eyeballs beat To catch his ray: a thousand times more sweet To perish blind for gazing thus, I know, Than look unharm'd upon the dusk below. —Cover my face,” And it was so: and thus He past away who was Callimachus. IN A NUTSHELL. In the Arcadia, Sidney's fair romance, There is a fragment of a fairy tale, Which clings about my heart and will not go. 'Twas Mopsa told it: rough and coarse was she, Stampt vulgar to the core with the brand self Unlovely and unlov'd; and, as she told, The hearers were unfain to hear, and yet She moon'd along, until one stay'd her tongue With gentle prayer that she would keep her tale For better audience and a better day. She lik'd the tale, or lik'd to tell the tale, And laid it in the silence, with the hope To tell it one day at a festival. Poor Mopsa! Here beginneth Mopsa's tale, Told, nearly as may be, in Mopsa's words. “In the time past,” she said, “there was a king, The mightiest man in all his countryside, Whose wife bare unto him a child that was The fairest daughter ever tasted pap. And the king kept a great and generous house Where all might come and freely take their meat. So one day, as the king's fair daughter sat Within her window, playing on a harp— As sweet as any rose was she: her hair Held by a rich comb, set with precious stones— There came a knight riding into the court Upon a goodly horse, one hair of gold, The other silver; and 'twas so that he, Casting his eyes up to that window of hers, Fell into such extremity of love, That he did grow not worth the bread he ate: Till, many a sorry day going o'er his head, With daily diligence and griefly groans, He won her heart and won her word to leave Her father's court and go along with him. And so in May when all true hearts rejoice, They stole away together, staying not To break their fast, but satisfied with love. And now as they together went, and oft Did fall to kissing one another's face, He told his lady how the water-nymphs Had brought him up, and had bewitcht him so, If any one should ask him of his name, He presently must vanish quite away. And therefore charg'd her, on his blessing, ne'er To ask him what he was or whither he would. So a great while she did his bidding keep, Till, passing through a cruel wilderness, As dark as pitch, her heart so burn'd in her, She could not choose but ask the question. Then he, making the grievousest complaints, That would have melted hardest wood to hear, There in the darkness vanisht quite away. And she lay down casting forth pitiful cries. But having lain so five days and five nights, Wet by the rain, burnt by the sun, she rose And went o'er many high hills and rivers deep Until she came to an aunt's house of hers, And stood and cried aloud to her for help. And she, for pity, gave a nut to her, And bade her never open it, till she Were come to the extremest misery That ever tongue could speak of: and she went And went, and never rested her at even Where in the morn she went, until she came Unto a second aunt, who gave to her Another nut.”—Here Mopsa's tale breaks off. I read this o'er, and ponder'd, till I saw Unto an end, albeit not Mopsa's end; Only an end that met the soul of one Small singer of the nineteenth century, Who felt her heart burn in her at the words, “And bade her never open it till she Were come to the extremest misery.” I think she must have found another aunt And gain'd another nut.—Though fairy tales Delight to deal in sevens and in threes, I let the third gift go and keep the two. This was the word went with the second nut, “Break this when thou dost know there is no need To break the other.” And she faintly smil'd,— “I think that will be in the day of joy, The day of joy that I shall never see.” Suppose a woman with a gift like this, Not to be us'd till she herself was come Unto the very extremest misery That ever tongue could speak of—how of it?— May it be thus?— The princes must go on Smitten of sorrow, driven of remorse, Seeking and never finding, till her limbs Refus'd to bear her up, and so she cast Her length upon a rocky beach, 'neath cliffs White, sharp, and strong and stern, around whose base Beat that eternal trouble of the sea. “And now,” she said, “the time is surely come, The very extremest time of misery, For what I seek is gone, and power to seek Is gone.” But lo, a voice that whisper'd, “Nay, For will to seek is thine; till that be gone Thou art not come to thy extremest woe.” And so she rose and still pursued her way, Bedrencht with rain, or faint for extreme heat, Footsore and tir'd; and yet there never came A moment in the which to pause and say, “Now am I come to woe's extremity.” And on her way she sang this song of hers. “I may not find thee, O my love of loves; My sin it was that drave thee from my side, My suffering would I give to bring thee back. Unfaith of mine hath struck thee like a flash Of lightning, and I cannot see thy face. My loss I know, but thine, who hast lost the light Of earth and all the sweets of human joy And grandeur of human suffering, know I not; I love thee and seek, though finding never come.” So cried she weeping, in a stranger land, And the men said, “Behold, the maid is mad!” And took her up in their ungentle arms And bare her to a dungeon underground, And left her there; so she was all alone With flitter-mice and heavy dark and damp, And silence; and on her bosom lay her nut, And yet she brake it not. But lo! a cry Smote through the horrible darkness on her ear; And, sharp upon her brain, no need of sense, There came the knowledge that he lay close by, Prison'd and tortur'd: then she lifted up Her voice, that bare exceeding love and ruth In a strong cry upon her lover's name. But it sank quivering on the darkness' heart, And could not reach him, for the walls were thick. Then moan'd she in her grief, “The time is come, My most extremest time of misery, For I am fain to help and cannot help; No darker time can come.” But the same voice That stay'd her heretofore, rose up, and said, “Thou hast the will to help, if not the power; Therefore thou art not in extremest woe.” And then the princess askt, “Is there yet more?” And this the answer, “Not for thee, O child, The extremest misery tongue can utter forth, Or shuddering silence hold upon her breast; Seeing that all the suffering laid on thee Hath quicken'd thee, not kill'd thee: sharp regrets For sin have prickt thee on, not stung to death: Great waters going over thee washt clean, Not drown'd thee: therefore rise and break the nut Whose breaking was to be when thou wert sure Thy woe should never be extremest woe.” And so she brake the nut—and then—there came That which I know not how to tell—great joy And peace and strength—and came for both of them, The seeker and the sought. I dedicate This little tale to You, for You will know: And, if some throw the thing aside, because I have mixt the thought of separate centuries And thence brought forth some strange inconsequence, I shall be satisfied, if You approve. If any shrug the shoulder, saying, “Well, But Mopsa never would have ended thus.” You know I never said or thought she would. GOOD-BYE. There is no one but you with me now? it is well, for I wanted to say A word in your ear alone, before I am taken away. Stoop to me, love, till I touch your brow with my lips again— I wish they could smooth away the furrows of care and pain. Don't fret—there is comfort to come, and it must be best, I know, Because it was God's sweet will that I should arise and go; But if He had left me a while, had left me to be your wife, I should have made you forget the sorrow that gloom'd your life. I know it, my dear, my dear; the wisest and best of you all Have been snar'd from the heights of their strength and faith into sudden fall; Snar'd from their loyalty's glory to peril their lofty place, For a shrine that has never a god, their souls for a beautiful face. What is it, darling of mine? You say you were vain and untrue? Belov'd, in the darkest hour of that darkest night, I knew When the glamour past from your eyes, you would be your own self once more— And I, you know it full well, I lov'd you the same as before. The same, though I gave you back, unshrinking, your plighted troth, And told you, with tearless eyes, that I thought so best for us both; But when you left me I knelt, and with crying and tears I crav'd, Not, dear, that you might be mine, but that somehow you might be sav'd. Sav'd, undegraded, unstain'd, from the breast of the ruin that mocks With the semblance of holiest things, while it shears off the strong one's locks; Sav'd to the grace and the glory that only the pure can know, The life that is warm as the sun, the life that is white as the snow. When you came from the wanderings home, I should scarcely have known you again, For your face was chang'd so much with traces of struggle and pain, And your eyes were so deep and sad, and even over your brow My yellow harvest was dasht with a sprinkling of early snow. But O, my belov'd, my belov'd, that look in your face you had The look for a woman who lov'd and had waited, to see and be glad; I knew you would come to the Father, come home from the stranger's country— I knew not how strong through the struggle my darling would come back to me. You are weeping silently here! There are tears on the hand you hold! “Poor little hand,” you say, “undeckt of the marriage gold.” Ah, but my dear, we shall know, when the time of the purpose is ripe, Love in the glory unveil'd that needeth nor symbol nor type. Stay from your weeping a while; so—raise my head on your breast; Is the light passing away? No matter, this light is the best. Think, love, when you're closing my eyes, and crossing my hands to-night, “It never was grief that slew her, but overweight of delight.” For the harp that was lone so long, when it felt your hand once more Lie light and strong on its strings, as in happy days of yore, In its agony of bliss, gave forth such music in token To the dear, dear hand that swept, that its golden strings were broken. I wanted to make you happy—but God will do so still; Has not His tenderness made it easy to trust His will? It will be morning soon—morning for me and for you— God be with you, my darling; He will be with me too. BLUE AND WHITE. “Of all the colours that are, say what may your favourite be?” And the lad I had nurst back to life lookt up and made answer to me, “Two colours I choose, blue and white.” Then up from my throat did there spread Yea, up to my very temples, a dye of happy rose-red: For a maiden's face will flush for the lightest thing ever-more, And blue was the ribbon that bound my hair, and white was the gown I wore. “May I tell you all, lady sweet?” “Ay, sir, an it please you so.” Together and all alone we sat in the firelight's glow; Myself and the lad our men had found nigh dead close by:— The mother that bare him could never, I think, have nurst him more gently than I. “Fair sister—nay, pardon the freedom—but oh! you have been so good, I well could wish that I ow'd you the duty of brotherhood; Now crown your sweet favours with this, the greatest of all, and be As tender to that true-love of mine as you have been tender to me.” The light seem'd blurr'd away, and all was strange and dim For a little space, as there I sat and listen'd to him: A little space, but then, by the helping of God's dear grace, I spoke and answer'd, “Yea, brother, I will,” with a very smile on my face. “God bless you!” he said from his heart: “now listen; a year ago She gave herself to me for ever and ever; and so, One still, sweet Autumn eve, in the time of the falling of dew, I gemm'd that little white hand of hers with a circlet of sapphires blue. For she, my own lady and love, takes ever the most delight In the delicate virginal calm of the colours I nam'd, blue and white; And it seem'd I was sooth'd all o'er with a sense of fair repose, O dear new sister, seeing you wear the colours my darling chose.” O bonny blue ribbon, you prest on my brain too tight, too tight! O heart, how wildly you beat beneath your virginal white !— Dear friend, in whose happy home the love-fire burneth free, I am glad God's hand has given to you the joy it has kept from me. DAVIE CARR. Are you asleep, little Davie? I've slipt away from the gloom; It was, oh, so dreary to play in the lonely, darken'd room: The blinds are all pull'd down and our books put by on the shelf: But I don't care for holidays now when there's no one to play but myself. You are fast asleep, little coz: I won't disturb you, but croon So softly it will not awake you; you'll think it's a bit of a tune You are listening to in your dreams as you lie so pale and still;— Won't your pretty red roses come back? I wonder whether they will. You've lain so long, so long, in that wearisome bed, coz dear, They will hardly come back before the red June roses are here: The angels that love the flowers will come to our gardens then, And maybe they'll kiss your cheeks and make 'em rosy again. I think there's a secret for us to hear in a day or so, For I heard old Nursey whisper to Aunty, “when may she know?” I know it was me they meant, but Aunty just turn'd to the wall— But when you get up they'll find we are sharp enough for 'em all. I'm tir'd of holidays, Davie; I'd like to do lessons again; But Aunty looked just as she looks, you know, when her head is in pain, When I offer'd to bring her my books, and said, “Little Alice, nay, You needn't mind lessons just now; you may go to your dolls and play.” So when she went out of the room with that sorrowful look in her face, (I hadn't been naughty indeed,) I stole away from the place, And left Miss Doll on the floor in her grand new frock that I've made;— I'll shew it you when you get up—that won't be just yet, I'm afraid. I've minded your toys for you, Davie; your little pet bird I have fed; And you couldn't have taken more care of your garden yourself, Robin said; There are funny green letters sprung up; you never would guess what they are— It's a secret—but then you're asleep—D.C. for your name, Davie Carr. They've cut off your nice little curls: 'twas a pity, but then, you know, You'll be just as happy without 'em; they'll never get tangled so: Your hands were as brown as mine, and now they are just as white As Aunty's—and how did you keep the bed clothes so tidy all night? You're sleeping a long, long while: good-bye, little coz: oh dear, I'm afraid, if I stay any longer, they'll come in and find me here. If I kiss'd you perhaps I should wake you: good-bye, make haste to get well— I am very lonely without you, more lonely than I can tell. AN OLD MAID. Sitting with folded hands, that have dropt the needle and thread, Looking athwart the fields, where the evening light is shed On the waving grass, and whence arises the lowing of herds, While the happy leafage thrills because of the time of the singing of birds. Sixty rings, I think, have circled her life-tree's girth, Sixty years of the world, with its mingled pathos and mirth. How has she taken the time since her baby-steps were set Among the anemones' bloom, and the sweets of the violet? What has she been, who sitteth with delicate lights dropping down On the bow'd head's silver locks, and the folds of the silken gown? Has she not walkt on the way that she chose at the gates of youth, Bright in the graces of holiness, grand in the splendours of truth? Bearing the hopes of the sowing, the gladness of those who reap; Smiling with those who are smiling, weeping with those who weep; Graciously grave, serenely bright, with a wisdom large and mild, A man's clear judgment, a woman's love, and the faith of a little child. Her heart is the little ones' nest, grown tired of the ball and the race, They come to be rested because of the love in her beautiful face; One silent clasp of her hand most deeply has comforted Women and men too, whose eyes have wept for the false or the dead. And many a heart that bleeds for its sin, and yet could not bare The throb of its shuddering nerves to a cold, analytical stare, Lying lone on the wayside of life, she, tenderly bending above, Doth soothe with the unguent of mercy, and cheer with the strong wine of love. Was there ever a pitiful cry in the depths of her gracious soul For the wifehood's joy denied, and the motherhood's aureole? Can her thought go back to a time when her patient footsteps trod Among the grieving thorns, alone with sorrow and God? However it be, on her face is the look of sweet content That comes when the music of life of love and duty is blent; And peace is hers that is more than the joy of morning prime, And light that is greater than day, has come at her evening time. PADDY. “William O'Grady, bachelor, and Mary Lee, spinsther.” So His Riverence call'd us in the church, it's just five year ago. Three times the banns was put up for us, but, The u through as in put. the day that follow'd the third, I meets my Mary an' says ‘Let us each give back the other their word.’ She knew why I spoke out then to her; it was growin' for manny a day Afore at last it lep' into speech, as we stood amoong the hay, Down in the half-mown meddas: the sun was gone to rest, An' the corncrake was crakin' an' croakin',—I knew where she had her nest. It wasn't a sharp, quick quarrel iv ours, to blaze up sthrong an' die out; It wasn't doubtin' each other we was, we niver had had a doubt; But a thing that had smowldher'd an' smowldher'd until I'd made up my mind at last, The loove As in look, I'd been buildin' my future on must just be a thing o' the past. “Mary,” says I, “there's a word, a name, that coomes between us two, A name that slips like a bit iv a sting from that purty mouth iv you; Ah, my child! I know it well, so where's the good iv a fuss? Say good-bye, an' let it all be as it never had been for us. Ye never would call me Paddy as ye do, if ye didn't despise Somethin' about me or in me; an' it doesn't seem right in my eyes A girl should look down in anny way on the man she's goin' to wed— That's enough; ye know how the' say, soonest mendud where laste is said. Ye're better nor me a hoondherd times, but only betther becos Ye're a woman—the sweetest woman on earth, the dearest that ever was— An' not becos iv yer English blood, for, were ye a man, it's thrue, I'd look ye sthraight in the face an' say, ‘I'm as good, every bit, as you.’ What right had ye, Mary, I axe, to have that look in your face, an' spake O' my counthry in words ye shouldn't ha' us'd, not for my sake, but right' sake; Ring out yer scornful Paddy! as if my Irish blood was a taint The Lord 'ud have to burn out o' me afore he could make me a saint? Counthry! what good's in a counthry? Why this, I take it, indeed— God made us all wan flesh an' blood—that's thrue, but God decreed Father an' mother, an' family o' brothers an' sisthers then, An' next the clan, and next, I think, the country was made for men. An' I loove my father an' moother well, an' broothers an' sisthers too, An' loove my people, an' loove my land, like a loyal man and thrue. Maybe it's proud ye're thinkin' me? I think there's some things, dear, God manes us all to be proud about, an' I think I've wan iv 'um here. I don't deserve to be despis'd; I'd be wrongin' God if I said That becos he made me an Irishman, I ought to hang down my head. England says, ‘Where's Ireland's wrongs? They're all in the long ago; We're thratin' Ireland handsome enough.’ An' all the while, ye know, Englishmen wid a laff an' a sneer, or a pat on the back that's worse, Talks o' the Paddies they've got to manage, an' turns their good to a curse. Ireland's wrongs! Well, Mary—no, I am not goin' to jaw; I'm sore all over, too sore to scold. It's a long while since I saw Ye lookt down on me becos o' my blood; I thought I could make it right, But I couldn't—it wasn't anny use; so I say good-bye to-night. It was only yester-eve, my dear, ye thrated me just like this, An' I lay awake all night, an' I made up my mind that betther it is, Ay, maid an' bachelor's betther we part, nor go through a maybe long life, A wife that despises her husband, a husband despis'd by his wife! I've spoke about it manny a time; ye know I have, my dear; I wouldn't take y' up short like this, I wouldn't coome to ye here, Afther the banns was call'd an' all, if I hadn't ha' spoke afore: I know its dhreadful breakin' the plight, but it's dhreadful, ten times more To go through wedlife wid broken peace. They'll know it's all my fau't; They'll never wrong ye, Mary dear, wid the shadda iv a thought. Forgive me touchin' at such a thing, but I know what things the' say— They'll never dare to say 'um o' you, that's all; ye can thrust me? Eh?” Then I turn'd away an' left her there, who never had said a word, An' I listen'd, but grasshopper's chirrup and cry o' corncrake only I heard. I gother'd up my horruble grief an' sthrode away from the place, An' left the girl, who had been my girl, wid a hush an' fear in her face. An' I wisht I might be a woman for wonst, ay, so from my heart did I; For a woman might ease her heart wid tears, but a man have no call to cry. Crake! crake! crake! she called, that bird, an' the grass-hopper chirrupt so sthrong, An' the jew was fallin' heavy an' thick, as, alone, I walkt along; The air was dhrencht wid the sweets o'the flowers, for, all the way as I went, The roses, an' woodbine, an' manny more, was givin' out such a scent. An' afther a while I stopt my walk, an' down, wid weary limb An' wearier heart, I sat on a stone, an' life lookt sthrange an' grim: The flower breath seem'd to choke me a'most, an' even the feel o' the jew Was like a fever an' not a cool, an' the moon came out an' grew, Sailin' along in the big blue sky, she grew to an awful size; An' all the stars seem'd starin' down on me wid their pitiless eyes: Eyes o' fire, an' eyes o' fire, an' eyes o' fire they were, Till I hid my face—an' when I lookt up, her eyes was shinin' there. She puts her two arms round my neck, and says, “My love, forgive.” An' I looks sthraight into her face to see if my hope, just born, might live; “Then, are we equals in God's sight?” “No, love,” says she, “becos Ye're betther nor me, for ye wouldn't give up yer manhood for me that was Silly an' stupud enough—” but here I stopt her words wid a kiss— “Are we equals now in blood an' birth?” an' Mary answer'd “Yes.” An' I rose to my feet, an' she flung herself on my breast in sobs an' tears:— I wouldn't ha' made her cry like that for the joy iv a thousand years: But thin for the right it's a different thing.—She cried that night, Isay; But niver a tear since thin for me, an' we're marrud five year to-day. THAT BOY. Thank you, Willie, my child, this is very cosy and sweet; Son and daughter in one, sit down here at my feet. What a great fellow you're growing! and ever, still as you grow, You are liker another Willie, my darling of long ago. I like to talk to you of him, I know that you understand ;— Yes, dear, draw closer to me,—so—closer—and hold my hand; That other Willie of mine, who past from my sight for a space, With the dew of youth on his locks, and the light of God on his face. Strong, and joyous, and true; 'twould not have been easy to find One more thoroughly healthy, alike in body and mind; With his clever strong brown hands, and the laugh from his heart that rang, And the noble thoughts half hid, half told in his school-boy slang. Sometimes he'd dream for an hour, then call out for something to do; He had feet that were ready for service, and innocent mischief, too; Was careless of clothing and cash; I remember his mother would say That money burnt holes in his pockets before he had had it a day. He had fancies graceful and strange. You know those odd, grotesque Faces he cut with his pen-knife upon his deal-wood desk: And you know those sketches of his, where under the crudeness lay A life and a fire that must have wrought good work some day. I loved to watch him at church, as he sat in the corner-place, A light from within or without, you knew not which, on his face, As his soul went up to God in the singing and praying that rose: And his face was a poem that taught me more than the sermon's prose. And oh! those holiday times when the vague delicious blue That grew into greenwood anear, our jubilant footsteps drew Through light that never was glare, and shade that never was gloom, To the tufts of primroses fair, and the wild blue hyacinths' bloom. Yes, dear, it was he who taught my soul in the long ago The great invisible love by the visible love to know: It was first in that bright young life that ever I understood To make people happy, Willie, is surely to make them good. He made people happy, Willie, just in his earnest or play, He couldn't help it, that's all; and, oh! when he went away, There was many and many a heart that mourn'd for the lad, whose life Had deepen'd its every-day joy and strengthen'd for every-day strife. They say that all pure souls grow to their stature's stately height Of manhood in Godhead baptiz'd, in the land of love and light; But I think of him just as I knew him, and oh! it is such a joy To know that the heart of Christ once beat as the hear of a boy. A ROSE. The sweetest rose it was, the loveliest He could in all his garden find: He brought it, saying, “Darling, leave your quest Of knowledge for a little while, and rest In sweet belief that Nature teaches best.” Well did he speak for, blind To deep delight that Nature gives, I was Unquiet-soul'd a seeker for the cause Of many a thing and, with cold eyes, I sought to read close-folden mysteries, Forgetting Love, not Knowledge, maketh wise. I took his rose and laid it to my mouth. For one sweet hour I was a girl again, Forgot my theories form'd at cost and pain, And all I had gone through for knowledge' sake. The soul of Eden fragrancy divine Enter'd this soul of mine And quencht its desperate drouth. It was because I took when Love said “Take.” My very brow grew smooth For drops of spray tost from the Fount of Youth. But, woe is me! I could not let this light and beauty be! I pull'd the petals of my rose apart, With fingers most unkindly tore aside The crimson veil that veil'd its golden heart. I saw the gold, but ah! the flower died. And, all unwomanly, in pride, “Away with ignorance!” I cried, “My flow'rs shall all be knowledge-bringers! To what availeth joy unless one knows Its why and wherefore?” But my lover sigh'd, “Ah, lady, you have kill'd my rose!” And his true eyes with unshed tears grew dim, Because the voice that had been unto him Sweetest among the voices of the singers, On God's good world flung discord's bitter wrong Instead of sweetest song. And never now a word of love he speaks, But talks of systems and of rules and laws, And of effect and cause, As learned men talk unto learned men— And my heart inly breaks, For oh! to be a woman once again! So, cruel hand which could such joyaunce slay, Lay down your pen for aye, For you will never write those deep-ton'd songs Of Love and Truth, to live on human tongues, That human hearts may beat more quick and pure. But how shall I endure When One, with sadder eyes than his I griev'd, Shall look on me whose garden is dead-leav'd? O ghost of that sweet rose I kill'd, Wilt thou for ever haunt me night and day? Must all my life for aye With breath of thy dead leaves be fill'd, And golden dust defil'd cling to the feet That on thy quivering heart unpitying trod, And evermore that still, sad voice repeat That whoso wrongeth Nature wrongeth God? A DEAD WORKER. Cross her hands upon her breast: Hands she never rais'd for pray'r In her toil; but, in her rest, Let them lie, cross-folden fair As they had won prayer's reward: Poor dead hands all seam'd and hard. What was she who lieth there, Little past her early youth; Eyes coin-shut that else would stare, Bandage closing up the mouth; No one having car'd to dress Death away from ghastliness? Young? Nay, she was dull and old, Thinking but of market-price, Just its copper, not its gold; With no glory in her eyes. At the rising of the sun Wishing weary day-time done. Just a mere bald life was hers, Missing our deep questioning, What the outer universe To the inner world may bring? Stagnant soul that, all without Faith or hope, could know no doubt. Missing Love, and so, with it, Missing all of Love that grew: Missing too the exquisite Morn-flusht skies and early dew. Ah, of Love and Beauty reft, What worth having is there left? Silence kept without the pain Speech denied brings bitterly: Silence kept without the gain Of a larger speech thereby: Silence always:—was there naught She could tell us of her thought? Did God hold her just as dear (Hard, if so, to realize) As our saint whose soul shone clear Through her pure, pathetic eyes; Whom we gaz'd on dead as though Love itself lay still and low? In the framing of our chart, For the unexplored land We must leave an unfill'd part Till, some day, we understand All the good things life may yield In the country new-reveal'd. But we fancy streams and trees, Rock and moss and vale and hill; Till the new land clad in these Seems not unfamiliar still. There must be, whene'er we come, Something in it like our home. Oh, the home we love must be That strong Heart which loveth best: In that other country He Still is Home, so let it rest. Cross her hands and leave her so, Only He who loves can know. Ah, and if she miss'd indeed Blessings which the life receives In the sowing of the seed, In the binding of the sheaves, Greater lessons God can teach In some other kind of speech. When her life shall take the grace Of His life that naught can dim, And the light is on her face, Caught from looking up at Him, Shall we meet as equals then? Sister, child of His, Amen. MADONNA DELLA VITA. Whoso will let him cast off the robe of his faith And the crown of his hope and the sceptre of love, And lie at the feet of the Lady of Death, Enwrapt in the slumber no trouble of breath, No tempest of joy or of sorrow can move. Not thine be such rest, O my brother, my knight, Who ownest the mighty ones' sinews and thews: Not theirs and not thine to despair and refuse The forefront of battle, the thickest of fight. I charge thee by all thou esteemest of worth Around thee and in thee, below and above, By the hintings of heav'n from the lips of the earth As she smiles in the clasp of the infinite love; By that infinite love which around us lies light As the ether, or grips like a stark fate austere; By the light and the darkness, the veil'd and the clear; By the mystical glories of red and of white; By the little we guess and the much we shall know Of the meaning of things that bewilder us here With fairness and foulness and gladness and woe: I charge thee to stand, though bedew'd with the sweat That is blood, armour hackt, and upon thee the stains Of travail and conflict, and over thee pain's Broad banner of dim, heavy purple, and wet With the floods thou hast past through to come to this place: For the foe is alive yet, and nothing of grace Must he have at thy hands till thou smite him to death; Thy foe who has vow'd to fordo her whose breath In the world's nostrils breath'd made it quicken, and lo! No longer red clay, but a glory and glow, And a flame, which is God, whosoever gainsaith. She stood in her splendour of beauty and grace By Sokrates' side, and she breath'd on his soul Till it would not be foil'd by the strange satyr-face, The mask of the clay that was fain to control. She smil'd on Gautama and kindled desire For the fairer than fair, and her love was the fire, The radiant, the lustral, that toucht him and caught The heart of the prince till it flam'd up one red In that light and its passion, and self lay all dead To rise never more, for the man was of those To whom hunger or fulness, or toil or repose, Or glory or shame, seeing God, matters not. Her hand held the Christ's from the womb to the grave, Through the flow'rland of childhood that smil'd as he stept, On, on, through the wilds where the heather scarce kept One touch of God's purple, hoar hill, and lone cave; On, on to the heights that in sheer steepness frown'd, Jagged cliffs, black for awe of the elements' strife, She led him unswerving, until he had found The terrible cruciform portal of life. Thou didst pledge her, unknowing, when speechless thou lay'st, In the milk of thy mother; and, later, in wine Of the world's life that thrill'd through the young veins of thine, In the splendid excess that knew nothing of waste; Thou did'st pledge her, 'mid horror and darkness, in brine Of the terrible waters that swept over thee Bedrenching and beating: then, scap'd from the flood, Didst thou stand by thy lady and look on that sea, And pledge her again, and the cup was thy blood. Thy lady! thou know'st her: her eyes are the light Of the world, and her heart is the fountain of joy, And her lips are light-curv'd to a smile, never coy But quickening and calming: and grand is her height And stately her going, and wondrous the white Of her brows; and her name—She hath many a name, As Love, Truth, Life, Sorrow; and whom she doth claim By the pledge he unshrinking redeems, he alone (Oh, pride for dishonour! oh, glory for blame!) Shall know by which name she delights to be known. TOO LATE. I am lying here with my head dropt low on your grave: the sky Is cloudless, pitiless blue: over all a quiet is shed, A desolate quiet that broods like the passionless calm and dead Of a heart that ne'er quicken'd its beats at the sound of beloved tread: The sun strikes blindly down from its noonday height as I lie With my very soul crampt up in the spasms of its agony. I feel the slow, slight shudder of growing grass at my ear Stir through the dead-brown hair that was wont to be so bright For the royal crown of love, whose very shadow dropt light Around me until I stood made fair and transfigur'd quite, And my face as an angel's was—O God of mercy, I fear The weight of my punishment now is greater than I can bear. My blood makes shuddering leaps as, alone in my dark, I think Of my own white stag whom the pitiless archers wounded sore; My royal eagle whose plumes were all bedabbled with gore; My strong one whose prideful locks of glory and might they shore; And the iron enters into my soul, and I shiver and shrink; And the bitter and awe of death is in the cup that I drink. O passionate outstretcht arms, ye may drop your warm, white weight On the cold, cold, silent grave, for he cannot feel you strain And beat against the impassable barriers to clasp him again— Scorch me, O glaring sun! Drench me, O pitiless rain! Nothing can make me dull to the terrible cry, Too Late! Or blind to the light that burns through the closed chrystal gate. O love, my beloved, I love you, I love you, I love you; I say Again I love you, I love you; but oh! that awful sea Of death rolls heavily in betwixt your soul and me, And my fireful words are drown'd in the roar of its waves, and she Who utters them sinks and fails, her garments weighted with spray, And hopes not the terrible tide will ebb out at the breaking of day. All through I lov'd you, dear heart! Oh, had I but told you so When your forehead was flushen red with the shame of your one, one sin; Nor open'd my soul's gate wide for pride to enter in; Nor turn'd my eyes away and left the devils to grin O'er the grand young fallen soul they waited to drag below; While I might have sav'd who lie with the Cain-curse on me now. Alas, my belov'd, my belov'd! that I left you to sink in the mire Till the garments you wore, once fair, ah, scarcely a vestige show'd Of the stately, saintly white they wear in the kingdom of God: While the hand was folded away that could have help if it would, Ere the last fair string was wrencht from the breast of the golden lyre, And the voice into silence sank, that was even the angels' desire. Come back to me living and erring, and body and soul shall be thrown As a bridge across the abyss, and the gulf at your feet be spann'd, And I be right glad to perish so you may but safely stand Unsmircht from the brow to the feet in the light of the holy land Where the Shepherd in pastures of rest folds every saved one; And no more may the eyeballs weep and no more may the lips make moan. GHOSTS. Dread you their haunting, O man of the world-wise brow? These ghosts, would you banish them all away from our earth? Alas! when I was haunted, the loveless dearth Never came over my soul that is over it now. Oh for the beautiful spirits that haunted me In the long, sweet hours of the pallid winter nights, With the noiseless garb, and the tremulous angel-lights, Lighting my soul, as the sun the desolate sea! What have I done that your cherisht presence is gone Away from my lonely hearthstone and loveless home? Vainly I stretch out imploring arms—ah! come As ye us'd to come, for now I am all alone. Fair little one, with the violet eyes, oh pass! Loving and bright as in other hours of grace, When the beauty and light of your childly joysome face Were to me as the presence of spring to the snowcovered grass. Statelier one, with the passionate ruddy gold Crowning the beautiful head that is grand and pround, Let the darkness be your garment, and not your shroud; Yea, shine, deep eyes, that never were quiet or cold. And you with the gracious eyes, come bend them on mine, Kiss away the furrows of pain from my face; Stay here, spirit, stay in this lonely place, Presence that thrills like a strain of song divine! You three us'd to come long ago, and smile With a perfect measureless smile, that thro' and thro' My soul sank, as to a rose's heart sinks dew :— Why have you left me here so lonely, while The working world is striving to keep me low, With its ledgers and day-books dull on my aching sight? Come, for I need the fall of your garments white To sweep the heavy earth-dust away from me now. Come, my beloved, who are not three, but one; O childhood! O girlhood! O womanhood, sweet and good; Each with its own most exquisite grace, that could Fill the heart with delight in itself alone. So unlike, that you seem not one, but three; How is it, Sweet? I know not, indeed, but this I know, that when you ceast haunting, my perfect bliss, My great one joy, was taken away from me. Were you not ever a spirit? you could not have been A mortal who bore the mortal title of wife; Yet this do I know, that I bear a changed life, And in the churchyard a grave, that seems mine, is green. RESTITUTION. Her face was marr'd with lines of pain and doubt: Love came instead of death and swept them out. Within her breast rag'd tempest strong and wild: Love still'd it into calm with, Peace my child. Her arms dropt nerveless after their fierce strain: Love lifted them, and they were strong again. er eyes were dimm'd with bitter weeping's awe: Love's holy salve anointed and they saw. Her eyes were deafen'd with the ruthless cry Of foes, upcrashing sharp against the sky: Sweeter than silence came Love's voice divine, Thou shalt arise again, for thou art Mine. Oh, the good word sank down into her ears, I will restore the locust-eaten years. So, in Love's light her face transfigur'd shone, And she grew very fair to look upon. O vineyard, wasted once of beasts of prey, Thou hast put forth thrice-glorious fruit to-day! O jewel, flung before the trampling swine, Love's hand resets thee in the crown divine! Maker, Redeemer, Sanctifier, Thou Hast seal'd her for Thine own from feet to brow: And every noble pow'r and each bright grace Flames in the perfect lustre of Thy face. LOIS THE HEALER. (“Gifts of Healing.”) Lois the Healer pray'd With soul uplift, “O Love the Beautiful, Give me this gift: Comfort and help to be Where'er I go, Cool in the summer time, Warmth in the snow.” So, on her tender lips, Brow, cheek, and breast, Love shed a baptism Of strength and rest. Thus on her way she goes, Blessing and blest, Till her life-day shall come Into its west. Men say, “She groweth old; See how her hair Weareth the silver threads Of time and care.” We, whom she healeth, know Light through the Gate Shines on her gracious head While she doth wait. BELOVED, IT IS MORN! Beloved, it is morn! A redder berry on the thorn, A deeper yellow on the corn, For this good day new-born. Pray, Sweet, for me That I may be Faithful to God and thee. Beloved, it is day! And lovers work, as children play, With heart and brain untir'd alway. Dear love, look up and pray, Pray, Sweet, for me That I may be Faithful to God and thee. Beloved, it is night! Thy heart and mine are full of light, Thy spirit shineth clear and white, God keep thee in His sight! Pray, Sweet, for me That I may be Faithful to God and thee. LOVE'S LEADING. Did love deceive thee, dearest, when he brought One so unworthy as this friend of thine To thy heart's temple, yea, its inmost shrine, And, through the veil of purple twin'd and wrought, Bade her come in, fearing and doubting not, And see the lamp's white flame that burns alway; And bade her care and trim it night and day? Oh, dreadful honour that she had not sought. Oh, torment of the doubt and the surmise, “How can I keep the sacred flame alight? My hand lacks skill and cunning, and my eyes Are dim because they have not wept aright, And my feet fail as his who walks by night—” But Love has led me hither, and Love is wise. WILD GRAPES. I wait to meet the Master: a white fleece Of cloud is hanging in the evening sky; A little paly gold lies tenderly About the sun's calm death-bed. Happy peace I know not, and my fellows whisper low, “What hast thou, O thou waiting one, to shew The One who cometh? For thy life's dear lease What hast thou paid?” And I—I do not know. Looks He for grapes? I have brought Him forth wild grapes; And who shall crush from these wild grapes of mine, Meet for that cup of His, the royal wine? I know not, but from my soul's depth escapes My child-right cry to Him Who all things shapes, “The worlds are Thine, my Father, and I am Thine.” “MAN IS NOT GOOD TILL HE CEASES TO STRIVE AFTER GOODNESS.” I There came one day a leper to my door: I shrank from him in loathing and in dread, But yet, remembering how old legends said That Jesus Christ so often heretofore Came in such guise to try His saints of yore, I brought him in, and cloth'd, and warm'd, and fed; Yea, brake my box of precious nard, to pour Its costly fragrancy upon his feet. And when the house was fill'd with odour sweet, I lookt to see the loveliest face,—but o'er The leper came no change divine to greet My eager soul, which did such change entreat. And then I bow'd my head, and wept full sore— Ah! the times change; such visions come no more! II With tear-dimm'd eyes I went upon my way, Past from the city to the April wood, Where the young trees in trembling gladness stood; And once again my grieved heart grew gay. Then did I see a little child at play; All the sweet April fountain of his blood Tost out in joy, that brake in laughter-spray; And all my heart it lov'd him; so I bent To kiss his sunny mouth. Then through me went That which I may not tell, nor can, to-day. When was such healing with such wounding blent? Such pain supreme with such supreme content? The fires of God comfort as well as slay, Else had I surely died, who am but clay. IN MEMORIAM. Praise to God for the fight so bravely fought! Praise to God for the work so truly wrought! Help to the weak-arm'd, strength to the feeble-kneed O thou thinker of many a noble thought, O thou doer of many a noble deed! WHY? I said “I will serve my God and man.” So I took my life and wrencht it away From things it clung to, as life so can, The beautiful things of dawn and day And scent and music; and in the gray Dim twilight kept it. But lo, it began To cry for its beautiful reds and blues, And moan'd and sobb'd as the moments ran Into hours and days, and I would not choose Aught else but the sad and sober hues. And my life was fain for the joyous shout Of youth and spring, and I husht it then And said, “Thou must serve thy God and men! So life, my life, be content without The things that thy fellows may not have; Sell all and give to the poor, and crave No more, for the night-time cometh, and then No man can work: toil on and slave; Thrice pitiless to thine own self be; God's pity is enough for thee.” But I could not still its murmuring, And at last, at last, I brought it back To the dear old world, and bade it cling To the beauty and brightness; but, dull and slack, Its tendrils dropped away from each thing They were wont to clasp; and I moan'd “Alack! What matter to me if the sky be black And the song-birds droop with broken wing? Oh woe is me that I cannot care! I sit dull-eyed, with faded hair, And I cannot weep and I cannot sing, And I care not to serve God or men, I care not either to work or wait.— The shadows are falling, it groweth late, The night-time cometh, and soon: what then?” AT EVENING. I sit alone in the evening, Alone in the waning light; And I wait for my lady's coming To comfort my soul to-night. She comes in her noble beauty, In her tenderness and truth; Her Love and Death have gifted With everlasting youth. God's light on her gracious forehead; God's peace in her joyous eyes; God's comfort that goes out from her To cheer and to harmonise. My life is full and busy, For its love runs deep and wide; But here, in my lady's presence, It keepeth a sabbathtide. And softly the shadows of evening On our blessed commune fall, Till the children's voices call me Away to the mirth-fill'd hall. I go to play with the children, And close to my heart I hold That one little shining ringlet, That soft little curl of gold. I took it the night she lay dying From the head on my breast that lay, That precious memory-token Of a love that is mine for aye. She never will think I forget her, Though our laughter ring loud and wild; She loves me to play with the children, For she had the heart of a child. ONE SWALLOW. We are very glad to-day and lift our praises, For, with eyes that lookt out long and anxiously, While the cutting wind blew sharp against our faces, This one swallow did we see. O thou blessed swallow, matter not thou reach us Travel-faint and tir'd, with draggled plumage wet; Through the winter-awe thou comest now to teach us Of a spring we know not yet. Yes, to-day has set us free from that oppressive Going softly we had kept so very long, And we loose the strain of new-born joy excessive In a rain of tears and song. But “One Swallow does not make a Summer,” say ye, “Earth in dreary twilight lieth veil'd as yet; Many a weary wind must blow its blast ere may ye Seek the nascent violet.” Would ye quench with that drear adage joy that quickens In a triumph through our whole lives once again; Till the spirit, shorn of comfort, quails and sickens For your biting frost and rain? Nay, ye cannot take our holy joyaunce from us; Nay, ye cannot make the anointed eyesight dim Of the trustful eyes that waited God's good promise Which they had received of Him. Ye have only seen to-day one swallow flying From the sunny southern land where Summer is; But we know they come in flights with that undying Summer greater far than this. O the beauty and the joy that passeth telling! O the time of singing birds that soon shall come, When the trees put forth their leaves of fairest smelling, And the brooks no more are dumb! Oh, we take the blessed guerdon none receiveth Save whose soul 'gainst doubting's bitter breath can prove That sweet grace which all things hopeth and believeth, Not credulity, but love. AFTER THE DAY-WORK. Darling, to-night I claim of you That which so often I have claim'd; Look my whole spirit through and through With eyes that will not make asham'd As the calm eyes of angelhood, Never bedimm'd with weeping, would. Dear, life is short and art is long, And I am weak who should be strong, Restless who perfect calm should know, And empty who should overflow: Just a tir'd child to you I come, O more than mother, more than home. Kiss me upon the weary eyes, Tir'd after day-work's stress and strain; I shall see clear when I arise, I shall be young and strong again; For there was none but you could lull Thus into rest, my beautiful. LOVE-SONG. I know not whether to laugh or cry, So greatly, utterly glad am I: For one, whose beautiful love-lit face The distance hid for a weary space, Has come this day of all days to me Who am his home and his own country. What shall I say who am here at rest, Led from the good things up to the best? Little my knowledge, but this I know, It was God said “Love each other so.” O love, my love, who hast come to me, Thy love, thy home, and thy own country. A SONG OF THE UNSUNG. I would give anything Of all that I hold most dear If I could only sing The beautiful songs I hear. Who is it sings them? you say. My darling, how can I tell? I hear them the livelong day, And often at night as well. Songs of such comforting, So tender and sweet and true, That I would give anything Could I only sing them for you. SONNET. I was Pygmalion's handiwork; I grew Into that beauty he had bidden be; He saw, and gaz'd, and lov'd exceedingly, Yea, lov'd me into life. He little knew I, who was his and he and myself too, Had other life in store for him and me, Art's life of splendid immortality, A meed for ever paying, for ever due! Why did he win for me this mortal breath Why did the ivory sheen of face and limb Flush into tender ruddiness for him? O fateful praying love that quickeneth! Alas for the perisht pride, the fame-gold dim, The gift, my life, that to his name was death. OUTLEFT. What shall we do for her, our sister? What can we do for her, you and I; For, oh! the sunshine hath somehow miss'd her, For, oh! the dewfall hath left her dry! Never we felt it and yet we know it, Anguish and wrong that her life doth prove; You, because you were born a poet, I, because I was born your love. Shall we not care for her greatly, seeing How it was given to her to hold, Down in the depths of her inmost being, Love that could never be shown or told? Well does she know that loving is living, Does not her heart with the thought half break? Sorely she longs for the joy of giving, None will stoop down unto her and take. Many would rise and call her blessed, If she were one whose face could tell That which her tongue leaves unexpressed, That which her spirit knows so well. Ay, if we could, such face we had won her, Strong with her life's true emphasis; Pale for the stress of love's infinite honour, And warm rose-red for its infinite bliss. Oh, but our sister, our little sister, What must we do for her, you and I? Seeing love's lips have never kiss'd her, Seeing love's feet have past her by. Oh, we will tell her we love her truly; Ask her to love and to care for us— Will it seem strange to her, wonderfully, Will she not think that we mock her thus? After the years of dull repression, Folding her up in their darkness deep, Blown on by spring-winds that rouse and freshen, Will she not think that she walks in sleep? Opening her eyes, she will see around her, Glory and beauty passing bright; Then she will know that Love has found her, Love that is surely one with light. And it shall be that, a little while hence, This little sister we care for thus, Loosing her heavy veil of silence, Lifting her voice, will sing to us. Sing to us, weep to us, laught to us, render Love what is love's through all calms and stirs; Cling to our breast as a baby tender, And as a mother clasps us to hers. A LETTER. John Graham to the one who was his own Sends greeting kind and half a broken ring, And many her letters, and this last of his. You know me, Alice Ker, and what I am, So little, you may be surpris'd, I think, To read the words that I have writ above, As well as griev'd: I think you will be griev'd A good deal; for you had made up your mind To play the ministering angel here, And comfort me and help me faithfully: And, knowing I was blinded where I lay Asleep for weariness, on time's great shore, You would have suffer'd me to take you up Within mine arms, and rested on me blind, And, seeing for me, guided me across The waste, and set me where the rising sun Should smite mine eyeballs into sight again. This was your good intent, dear Alice Ker— Ah, I am bitter—well, I will not be— Nay, bounteous-brow'd and bounteous-hearted, nay, I ask not for such largesse nor will take. I bar'd my heart before you, but you thought 'Twas cover'd still: the veil was on your eyes, Or had I let you come too near to see? Suppose the father of the prodigal, Upon his way to meet the erring one, Had chanc'd upon the elder son who ne'er Had vext his soul for harlot-wasted goods, And fallen upon his neck and pardon'd him The faults and follies he committed not, How could the young man take such love as that? Had he not wrong'd his soul in taking it? I say that self-abasement, undeserved, Is but one shape of the damned Protean lie. So, Alice, is it now 'twixt you and me: You fain would pardon, slay the fatted calf, And bid me don the robe and ring and shoes. I have not sinn'd and will not take such grace. God never sets us level with His eyes, Lest we go blind: but, in some shape of earth, Veiling Himself, reveals Himself, or would If we would, but, we willing not, He stands Powerless, because He will not force our will. What are these words betwixt us twain? Am I A god? No—but, maybe, a veil of God, And hence His revelation: yours, if so You had will'd: you willing not, I take my way. I lov'd you, dear, and love you passing well, And yet I will not, cannot, say that life Without you is a desert: God is here And work; and God and work are all enough. And I will work just as I should have done With you to work beside me, even you Who cannot fail to live a noble life, Being noble through and through: and so, good-bye, God bless you: so, good-bye, dear Alice Ker. “DISCOURAGED BECAUSE OF THE WAY.” With the earth-dust on our raiment and the earth-tears on our cheek, Wrestling sorely in our passion, in our patience very weak, Far off, far off seems the city which from far we still must seek. Past the sunrise and the sunset glories of the east and west, Where the fair and good things ripen to the fairest and the best, Where the heart beats on untiring, and in serving is at rest. Oh, the never-ceasing conflict! Oh, the stress on heart and brain! “Lord, deliver us from evil!” mournfully we cry again; But the underbreath of passion is “Deliver us from pain!” Look upon us, God and Father! there is none to save but Thee: Look upon us, God and Father! strengthen Thou each feeble knee: Thou canst make the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, the blind to see. Shame on us, on us faint-hearted, pausing here to weep and moan, When beyond all thought's conceiving is the glory we have known, Seeing, Father, Thou didst love us into life who were but stone. Bid the weary silence break because of symphony and song, And the weary darkness pass because of glory white and strong, For the love that kills all coldness, and the right that slays all wrong. BY ME: IN ME. I. Whatever Thy will may be, Lord, let it be done by me. Oh, give me the joyful strength That fails not for journey's length; And the swift, obedient feet That hasten their tasks to meet; And the hands that, day by day, Delight in their work alway; And the voice that is true to raise The burden of prayer and praise; And the eyes that are swift to see, Because they are toucht of Thee; And the heart of love to share Thy little ones' joy and care: Whatever Thy will may be, Lord, let it be done by me. II. Whatever Thy will may be, Lord, let it be done in me: For now Thou hast laid me low In the mystery of woe; I am shut from speech and song, I am weak who was so strong, And my soul is known of Thee In her great adversity. So I clasp Thy feet, and say, “Thou hast given and taken away.” I know that I serve Thee so, In lying all meek and low; I know Thou wilt deeply bless In trusting and quietness; And I cry through the gracious gloom Of the fig-tree's perisht bloom, Whatever Thy will may be, Lord, let it be done in me. GRISILDIS. I curse you, O my son's wife, Grisildis! You, lady, mild of brow and still of tongue, And beautiful and fruitful, with the young Life's red upon your cheek, the gold that is Light captive on your hair. O fleur-de-lys, (He call'd you so) fall with white petals wrung From their fair rest, and golden bosom stung By piercing winds for the sun's tender kiss. Fallen he is now, my child, my Benjamin, Who should be upright, little who should be great; You hated not his sin, nor made him hate, Whose lustral love had burn'd him white and clean. Weep tears of blood for your soul-murder'd mate, O stupid lamb who lion should have been. A VOW ANNULLED. (Should ‘honour rooted in dishonour’ stand? And ‘faith unfaithful’ keep me ‘falsely true’?) Not broken it is, but annull'd, And for ever, the vow that I made When reason and conscience were lull'd, And I went on my way, unafraid Alike of God's sun or His shade. Did you know what it was to allure My weak, weary soul, tempest-driven, In the name of the pure from the pure, In the name of her God from His heaven, With its peace and its glory free-given? You askt me to save you by love; And Love by that word you blasphem'd; Love the holy, that soareth above, All saving that ever was dream'd: By God above all things esteem'd. They know not what Love is, who say That any can love and yet lose The right to look up all the day Crown'd with lilies as holy ones use, The Virgins the Bridegroom doth choose. Love is strength, glory, pathos, and fire; All colours blent into one light; A beauty exceeding desire, That sitteth with God on His height, Superb in immaculate white. I car'd not, you say, for your want— I know, dear, how lonely you were; Yet, by the lone hearth God will grant Souls possest in men's patience and pray'r His presence, than lover's more fair. Do you think that no anguish will come Strong-wav'd o'er my soul when I see, In the light of her lord's love and home, A wife with her child on her knee, To think what is lost unto me? But the anguish will pale at the last, In the light of the glory begun; More great than her glory, who, past The pain and the peril, has won The bliss of embracing a son. Most blessed, who deepliest feel The awe and the torment, and search Through tears for the hand that can heal And cleanse from the terrible smirch, And lay, pure, on the breast of His Church. Forgive me, as He doth forgive; I hurt you and hinder'd; yes, I Who had vow'd for His service to live, Was the worse and the weaker, I cry. Good-bye, dear! God bless you! Good-bye!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATIONS THE CENTAUR. (English from Maurice de Guérin.) Within these mountain-caverns I was born, And, like this valley's river, whose first drops Fall from some rock that weeps within deep grot Fell the first moment of my new-made life Into the dark of a remote abode, Leaving its silentness untroubled still. When comes our mother's hour of travailing, Towards the far caverns they retreat, and there, In wildest depths, where shadows thickest be, Bring forth, without a cry or murmuring, Fruit, silent as themselves. Their milk of might Doth feed us so that, with no languishing, Nor wrestling in a doubtful fight, we pass Life's first hard struggles; yet, less soon we go Forth from our caves than from your cradles ye Because we hold that it behoveth best To keep intact and folden close and calm The earliest seasons of existence,—days Fill'd by the gods. My growth had almost all Its course within these shades where I was born. The depth of my abode was sunk so far Within the mountain's breast, that I had been In ignorance of its outlet, but that winds, Which swerv'd against the opening, flung therein Their sudden troubles and their freshnesses. And sometimes would my mother enter, wrapt In valley-smells, or dripping from the waves; And those returns of hers, albeit she taught Me not of stream or vale, but only was Close-follow'd of their emanations, brought Disquiet to my life, and, passionate, I rov'd among the shadows. ‘What is it, This By ‘outside’ I have translated de Guérin's ‘ces dehors,’ of which Georges Sand says: ‘Cette expression est étrange, peu grammaticale, peut-étre; mais je n'en vois pas de plus belle, et de plus saisissante pour rendre le sentiment mystérieux d'un monde inconnu.’ outside, where my mother is self-borne Away? What reigneth there of mystic might, That calleth her so often to itself? And what strange opposites that make her come Thence every day emotion'd diversely?’ For she would come to me, now quick with joy, Now sad and trailing like a wounded life. I knew far-off that keen delight she brought By certain tokens in her step; 'twas shed From every look: I felt therefrom great thrills Of sympathy in all my breast. But most Her deep depressions mov'd me, leading me On, on, to guess towards what my spirit yearn'd. There wrought a great disquietude in me; I felt indeed and knew a force that might Not lonely dwell: and me betaking, now To shake mine arms, and now to gallop wild In the cave's spacious shadows, I essay'd To find, in the blows I struck on emptiness, Towards what my arms should stretch, towards what my feet Should bear me. . . . I have coil'd mine arms since then Around the centaur's bust, the hero's frame, The oak-tree's trunk:—My hands have tried the rocks, The waters, and the innumerable plants, And the most subtle impressions of the air:— Oft in the blind, calm night I lift mine arms To augur of my way— Melampus, see, How worn my feet! and, nathless, though I am Frore in the great extremity of age, Come days when, in full light, upon the heights I feel the self-same agitations come That came in youth, and with the same impulse, I toss mine arms, and use all left to me Of that youth's swiftness. Alternations came Upon these troublings, of long quietude From every restless movement. At such times My being held no other sense than that Of growth and all the gradual life that rose Within my bosom; lost were all the beats Of passion, and, in absolute repose, Unchanging drank I of the boon the gods Shed through my being. O'er the secret charm Of mere life-consciousness reign calms and shades. O shades that in these mountain caverns dwell, I owe that teaching to your silent care, That hidden teaching which sustain'd me well: And life I drank beneath your guardianship, Pure from the very bosom of the gods! And when I left your shelter for the light Of day, I stagger'd and I hailed it not Because it seiz'd on me with violence, Making me ebriate, as some fateful draught Pour'd suddenly into my breast, had done. And my whole being, till that moment's birth, So simple and so calm, was shaken and lost Much of itself, as scattered in the wind. Melampus, who would'st know of the centaurs' life, How did the gods' will guide thee unto me, The oldest and the saddest of them all? Long time it is since I have liv'd their life; No more I leave this mountain-top, where age Keeps me a prisoner; now mine arrow-points But only serve to loose for me the plants Of clinging fibre:—now the quiet lakes Know me—the rivers have forgotten me. Now will I tell thee something of my youth,— But woe is me! for such remembrances From drained memory falling, trickle slow Like drops of a libation scant that fall From a poor, broken urn. 'Twas easy task To tell of my first years, because they were Perfect and calm: life only, simply life It was that fed me; that is well retain'd And with no trouble told. A god, besought To tell his life, would tell it in two words. Full of unresting motion was my life; My footsteps knew no limit: in prideful strength I wander'd, stretching out in these wild wastes, On every side. One day, a vale unlov'd Of centaurs did I follow, and I spied A man, who walkt along the river's bank At the off side: the first whom I had seen, And I despis'd him, “for behold,” I said, “Half of my being; short of step; of gait Uneasy, and his eyes measure the space With sadness: 'tis a centaur overthrown By the gods' curse, who traileth thus along.” Full often from the river-beds I took Refreshing after day; half of my frame Hid in the waters, struggling to uprise Above them, while the other rose serene, And indolent arms were stretcht above the waves. Thus, self-oblivious in the waters' heart, I to their currents' impulse yielded me, Which, carrying me afar, brought their wild guest To all the changeful beauty of their banks. How often, night-surpris'd, I follow'd them Under the spreading shadows which bore down Into the vale night-influence from the gods. Then was my fierce existence mellow'd down Till only a little consciousness of life Was shed through all my being equally, As, in the waters where I swam, the gleams Of the great goddess who pervades the nights. Melampus, mine old age bewaileth sore The rivers; peaceful and monotonous For thé most part, they follow their destiny With calm beyond the centaur's, kindlier Wisdom than man's: me, issuing from their breast, Their gifts pursued, and stayed with me whole days, And, scentlike, in sweet slowness past away. A wild and blind inconstancy bare rule Over my steps:—in midst of fierce career My gallop would break to a sudden stay, as though Close to my feet there shudder'd an abyss, Or a god straight before me stood upright. And these strange, sudden immobilities Left me to realize a life deep-mov'd By the weird ecstasy that came to me. Of old have I cut branches in the woods Which, running, I would lift above my head; So swift the swiftness of my running, it made The motion of the leafage but a mere Light quivering; but, at the slightest pause, The stir and wind came back upon the branch Which wail'd again beneath it. Thus my life In those sharp interruptions of the race I dasht impetuously along the vales, Shudder'd strong shuddering all through my breast I heard it bubbling, rushing, rolling out The fire caught in the space that I had clear'd, And my quick sides beat struggling against the waves, That inward prest them; tasting in such storm A pleasure which the sea-shores only know, Of holding in and losing none of a life, Of a life wrought to its very highest highth. Nathless, with head bow'd to the wind that brought The cool to me, I saw the mountain-tops Made distant in few moments, and the trees Rootfast to the breast of earth, moving alone In branches sighing to the wind's light touch. “I only,” would I say, “have movement free; I, at my own will, bear my life along From valley's end to end: oh, happier I Than torrents falling down the mountain sides, To reascend no more: my footsteps' tramp Is grander than the plaining of the woods, Or the waves' clash: the centaur's echo 'tis Who, wandering, is self-guided.” Thus, the while Below I panted for the glorious race, Above I felt its pride, and turned my head And paus'd to look upon my smoking flanks. Youth, as I think, is like to the green wood Tormented of the wind: on every side Passion'd with life's rich gifts, and, evermore Some murmur deep reigns in her foliage. Thus, living with the waves' abandonment, And ceaselessly in-breathing Cybele In valley-beds or on the mountain-tops, I bounded forth, like a blind life unchain'd. But when the night, filled with the gods' deep calm, Found me upon the hills' acclivities, She led me to the entrance of the caves, And lull'd me, as she lulls the waves, to rest; Leaving in me those undulations light Which, holding sleep aloof, brake not repose. Thus, at the entrance coucht of my retreat, My limbs hidden within the cave, my head 'Neath the bare sky, I watcht the shadows play. Then the strange life that had bedrenched me All through the day, fell from me drop by drop, Back to the restful bosom of Cybele; As, after storm, the latest drops of rain That leaves had kept, fall down to join the waters. Melampus, it is said the sea-gods leave In shadow-time their deep-laid palaces, And, seated on the headlands, watch the waves. Thus watcht I, having at my feet a stretch Of life, most like unto a drowsy sea; And, to existence clear and full brought back, It seem'd to me the moment after birth, And that the waters, in whose womb I was Conceiv'd, had left me on the mountain-top, As some live dolphin left on shifting sands, Forgotten there by Amphitrite's waves. Mine eyes ran freely o'er all distances, Gaining, unstrain'd, the very farthest bounds. Like shores for ever moist the western hills Were quick with gleams the shadows might not blot Away, in whose pale clearness there uprose The pure and naked summits: there I saw Descend at times the all-solitary Pan, At times the choir of hid divinities; Or else some mountain nymph would pass, whose soul Was spell-bound by the night: the eagles too Of Mount Olympus soar'd across the highth Of the great sky, and vanished in those Far constellations; or, 'neath the sacred woods, The spirit of the gods, disquieted, Would trouble suddenly the old oak's calm. Melampus, who wouldst follow Wisdom, That Which is the Science of the Will Divine, And wand'rest 'mid the peoples, like to one The Fates mislead—in these abodes there is A stone which, at the lightest touch, gives out A sound like some sweet instrument's strings that break; And men relate that, when Apollo drave His flock into these deserts, he laid down His lyre upon the stone, and left thereon This melody: thus, O Melampus, thus, The gods, in wandering, have laid their lyres Upon these stones—none hath forgot it there! In those my times of watching in the caves, I sometimes made myself believe I might Surprise the dreams of sleeping Cybele; And that the mother of the gods, betray'd By those her dreams, might let some secrets fall. But nothing did I ever hear save sounds That melted in the breath of night; or words As the stream's babbling inarticulate. “Macareus,” said great Cheiron once to me, Our ancient, whom I followed, “how diverse Are our pursuits; my daily care to find The secrets of the plant, and thou—thou art Like those poor mortals, who have haply found Within the woods or on the waves, and borne Unto their lips some fragments of the reed Which Pan had broken, and, inhaling thence A wild, fierce spirit, or by frenzy seiz'd, Cross waters, lose themselves in mountain life, Restless and borne by a purpose all unknown. The Scythian mares, beloved of the winds, Are not more fierce than these, and not more sad At eventide when the North Wind has fail'd. Macareus, seek'st to know the gods and whence Have issued men and lower animals And principles of universal fire? Alas! old Ocean, father of all things, Fast holdeth all these secrets in his breast; And, singing, his surrounding nymphs describe Eternal choir before to him to conceal That which might chance escape from out his lips By chance half-open—Mortals that have mov'd The gods by their virtue have receiv'd of them Lyres that should ravish all the people's hearts, Or new seeds to enrich them; but alas, Nothing from their inexorable lips! Apollo taught me in my youth to seek The lore of plants; to spoil their veins of saps Beneficent: since then, I ever keep Me faithful to this mountainous abode, Restless, and yet, without surcease employ'd In quest of simples, and in making known The virtues I discover. Dost thou see From this the summit bald of (CE)ta? Look, Alcides 'spoiled it for his funeral pyre. The demi-gods, the children of the gods, Macareus, spread the lions' spoil upon Their pyres and burn them on the mountain-tops:— Earth's poisonous essences infect the blood Receiv'd from the immortal gods; and we, Centaurs, begotten of a mortal rash, Within the womb of a mist shapen like A goddess, what, alas! of help should we Expect from Jove who, with his thunder-bolt Did unto nought the father of our race? The vulture of the gods eternally Teareth the entrails of the artisan Who made the first man; O Macareus, men And centaurs know for authors of their blood The pilferers of the immortals' right: And, may be, all that stirs beyond themselves Is but a something stolen from them; a trace Of their own nature, borne like flying seed On the all-powerful breath of destiny. They say that AEgeus, Theseus' father, hid Chosen memorials whereby his son Might one day know his birth.—The jealous gods Have buried somewhere all the witnesses Of all things' source; but to what ocean's shore, Tell me, Macareus, have they roll'd the stone That keeps them cover'd?” This the wisdom was Whither great Cheiron led me: all reduc'd To age the most extreme, he nourish'd yet The loftiest thoughts: his breast, yet bold, scarce droopt Upon the flanks he rose serene above Slight-bending like the tempest-sadden'd oak! His going scarcely toucht by stress of years. One had suppos'd he kept the relics still Of immortality, the gift receiv'd From great Apollo, and giv'n him back again. For me, Melampus, into old age I sink, Calm as the constellations sink to rest. Still have I strength enough to gain the highth Of rocks, where oft I linger: there, maybe, To look upon the wild, unquiet clouds, Or watch the rainy Hyades uprise Above the horizon, or the Pleiades, Or great Orion: yet I know full well That I am minishing and losing me Like a snow-heap floating on the waters' breast; And soon I go to mingle with the streams Which flow to the great bosom of the earth. TO JENNY. (From the French of Victor Hugo.) Yesterday, darling of mine, a twelvemonth old! Happy you babble as, under the manifold Delicate leafage that lies on the dear Spring's breast, The year's new birdlets, opening their strange, wide eyes, Cheep and twitter from out the warmth of the nest, For the joy of the young plumes' growth and of life's surprise. O rose-lipt Jenny of mine, in those big books Whose pictures are worth your crowings and happy looks, The books I must suffer your fingers to crumple or tear; There is many a beautiful poem, but none so rare As you, my poem, when, catching sight of me, Your whole little body thrills and leaps with glee. The greatest men for writing have written ne'er A better thing than the thought a-dawn in your eye, And the musing strange and vague of one who scans The earth and man with an angel's ignorance. Ay, Jenny, God's not far off when you are nigh. FROM VICTOR HUGO'S “MAZEPPA.” Part II. Thus, when a mortal on whom his God is outpour'd indeed, Is bound on thy fateful croupe, O genius, fiery steed, He struggles in vain; with a bound, untoucht of his hand or heel, From the real thou bearest him forth, whose gates burst and break as they feel Thy feet, feet of steel. Thou clearest the deserts with him, and the hoary tops of the proud Old hills of strength, crossest seas, and beyond the depths of cloud Where darkness heavily lies; and, awak'd by thy footsteps' sound, A thousand spirits impure in their legion close press round Thy traveller bound. In one flight on thy wings of flame he reaches and sees the whole Wide fields of the possible there stretcht out, and all realms of the soul; He drinks from the river eternal: in storm-night or starnight now His locks with the locks of comets commingled, all flaming glow On the firmament's brow. The six moons of Herschel he sees; the ring of old Saturn there; And the pole that bends round her brow the nightly Aurora fair; All he sees; the ideal horizon, the limitless world's, in his sight Moveth on till it knoweth no limit, displac'd through the darkness and light By thy untir'd flight. And who, saving only the demons and angels, may know or may dream What he suffers in following thee, or guess the strange lightnings that gleam On his eyes, and the scorching and burning of many a fiery spark, And how, in the night, those cold wings shall strike at his brow in the dark, And no one shall mark. Affrighted he cries, but in vain: relentless, thy flight will not fail, The flight that o'erwhelms him and crushes; exhausted, and gasping, and pale, Each step thou dost take seems to hollow his tomb and he sinks in affright; Till the end comes—he runs, and he flies, and he falls—and he rises upright, A king in his might. THE WANDERER. (From the English of Cynewulf.) Still the lone one and desolate waits for his Maker's ruth— God's good mercy, albeit so long it tarry, in sooth: Careworn and sad of heart, on the watery ways must he Plough with the hand-graspt oar—how long?—the rimecold sea: Tread thy paths of exile, O Fate, who art cruelty. Thus did a wanderer speak, being heart-full of woe, and all Thoughts of the cruel slayings, and pleasant comrades' fall. Morn by morn I, alone, am fain to utter my woe; Now is there none of the living to whom I dare to show Plainly the thought of my heart: in very sooth I know Excellent is it in man that his breast he straitly bind, Shut fast his thinkings in silence, whatever he have in his mind. The man that is weary in heart, he never can fate withstand; The man that grieves in his spirit, he finds not the helper's hand. Therefore the glory-grasper full heavy of soul may be. So, far from my fatherland, and mine own good kinsmen free. I must bind my heart in fetters, for long, ah! long ago, The earth's cold darkness cover'd my giver of gold brought low; And I, sore stricken and humbled, and winter-sadden'd, went Away o'er the frost-bound waves to seek for the dear content Of the hall of the giver of rings; but far nor near could I find Who felt the love of the mead-hall, or who with comforts kind Would comfort me, the friendless. 'Tis he alone will know, Who knows, being desolate too, how evil a fere is woe. For him the path of the exile, and not the twisted gold; For him the frost in his bosom, and not earth-riches old. Oh, well he remembers the hall-men, the treasure bestow'd in the hall; The feast that his gold-giver made him, the joy at its highth, at its fall: He knows who must be forlorn for his dear lord's counsels gone When sleep and sorrow together are binding the lonely one; When himthinks he clasps and kisses his leader of men, and lays His hands and head on his knee, as when, in the good yore-days, He sat on the throne of his might, in the strength that wins and saves— But the friendless man awakes, and he sees the yellow waves, And the sea-birds dip to the sea, and broaden their wings to the gale, And he sees the dreary rime, and the snow commingled with hail. Oh, then are the wounds of his heart the sorer much for this, The grief for the lov'd and lost made new by the dream of old bliss. His kinsmen's memory comes to him as he lies asleep, And he greets it with joy, with joy, and the heart in his breast doth leap; But out of his ken the shapes of his warrior-comrades swim To the land whence seafarers bring no dear old saws for him. Then fresh grows sorrow and new to him whose bitter part Is to send o'er the frost-bound waves full often his weary heart. For this do I look around this world, and cannot see Wherefore or why my heart should not grow dark in me, When I think of the lives of the leaders, the clansmen mighty in mood; When I think how sudden and swift they yielded the place where they stood. So droops this mid-earth and falls, and never a man is found Wise ere a many winters have girt his life around. Full patient the sage must be, and he that would counsel teach Not over-hot in his heart, nor over-swift in his speech; Nor faint of soul nor secure, nor fain for the fight nor afraid; Nor ready to boast before he know himself well array'd. The proud-soul'd man must bide when he utters his vaunt, until He know of the thoughts of the heart, and whitherward turn they will. The prudent must understand how terror and awe shall be, When the glory and weal of the world lie waste, as now men see On our mid-earth, many a where, the wind-swept walls arise, And the ruin'd dwellings and void, and the rime that on them lies. The wine-halls crumble, bereft of joy the warriors lie, The flower of the doughty fallen, the proud ones fair to the eye. War took off some in death, and one did a strong bird bear Over the deep; and one—his bones did the grey wolf share; And one was hid in a cave by a comrade sorrowful fac'd.— Oh, thus the Shaper of men hath laid the earth all waste, Till the works of the city-dwellers, the works of the giants of earth, Stood empty and lorn of the burst of the mighty reveller's mirth. Who wisely hath mus'd on this wallstead, and ponders this dark life well, In his heart he hath often bethought him of slayings many and fell, And these be the words he taketh, the thoughts of his heart to tell. Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the giver of gold? Where be the seats at the banquet? Where be the halljoys of old? Alas for the burnisht cup!—for the byrnied chief today! Alas for the strength of the prince! for the time hath past away— Is hid 'neath the shadow of night, as it never had been at all. Behind the dear and doughty there standeth now a wall, A wall that is wondrous high, and with wondrous snakework wrought.— The strength of the spears hath fordone the earls and hath made them naught; The weapons greedy of slaughter, and she, the mighty Weird; And the tempests beat on the rocks, and the storm-wind that maketh afeard; The terrible storm that fetters the earth, the winterbale, When the shadow of night falls wan, and wild is the rush of the hail, The cruel rush from the north, which maketh men to quail. Hardship-full is the earth, o'erturn'd when the stark Weirds say; Here is the passing of riches, here friends are passing away; And men and kinsfolk pass, and nothing and none may stay; And all this earth-stead here shall be empty and void one day.</field>
