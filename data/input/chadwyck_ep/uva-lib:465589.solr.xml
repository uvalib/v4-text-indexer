      <field name="fulltext">THE STATE DUNCES. INSCRIB'D TO Mr. POPE. Once more, O Pope! I take the Pen in Hand, To lash the guilty Great Ones of the Land; Satyr, I find, is laid aside in vain, Fresh Dunces, see, appear a num'rous Train; Dunces to Merit who have no Pretence, Sworn Friends to Dulness, and sworn Foes to Sense. Nor need we doubt, whilst Appius has the Sway, But mighty Dunces will gain Ground each Day. Staunch blundring Dunces of right Spaniel Breed, Who'll ne'er forsake the Man by whom they're fee'd, But plunge through thick and thin in Time of Need. Amongst this gloomy Crew, this hireling Band, Well taught to fetch and carry at Command, First virtuous P?t our Attention claims, The best of Husbands to the worst of Dames: Poor Man! had but his Plot successful prov'd, How he'd been eas'd of one he never lov'd! To his Misfortune that was not his Lot, He was not born the Day before the Plot. However, 'twas well meant, th' Attempt was brave, And shews him not to Principles a Slave. Just such staunch Servants some Great Men desire, Who ne'er will flinch, whatever they require. But not alone does P?t serve the Cause, With him a num'rous servile Clan he draws, All ready broke, and disciplin'd to Hand, To speak or vote at Appius' Command; Had he but gain'd a few more such Supplies, He had not mourn'd his darling lost Excise. Then C?l next his venal Forces brings, A supple Clan which from the Highlands springs; All craving Wights, true Friends to Appius' Cause, Whilst he's in Power, and his Purse-Strings draws; But should the Giant once be in Disgrace, The fawning Slaves would turn, and curse him to his Face. Nor are these all of Caledonian Breed, By Giant Appius maintain'd and fee'd; Numbers behind, of the same truckling Race, Numbers, to human Nature a Disgrace, Demand in our Dunce-Catalogue a Place. A?rs, M?os, H?ns, and G?t, Gentry who think no Sin so great as Want. These trusty S?ts with Interest repay The Ills from us they've suffer'd since that Day, When their brib'd Members gave their Liberties away. How does their Nation now that Loss deplore, Greater than e'er they suffer'd heretofore, When the dire Terror of our Edward's Arms, Throughout their trembling Land spread wide Alarms! Oh! let us, grown by their Example wise, Be warn'd how we our Freedom sacrifice! That Jewel, once lost, was never yet regain'd; Let us not then by our own Votes be chain'd. Ask All, the French, the Swedes, the Danes, if they, Could they recover theirs, would give't away. But to the Dunces let's return again, Since num'rous Blunderers unsung remain, Who of Neglect shall have no Reason to complain. Shall C?sh, new grac'd with S?pe's Spoils, With Appius list, and I not sing his Toils? Toils much more glorious, in our peaceful Wars, Where there's no Danger, but of Venus' Scars, Than those, where tempting Death from hostile Hands, His great Forefather sought on C?'s Sands. O! did he live in these our happy Days, How would he launch forth in his Kinsman's Praise! Nor will I Timon's Heir forget to sing, Rewarded for his Service with a String. Go on, gay Knight, by Services so plac'd, In Time you'll equal your good Sire in Taste. See gentle B?n next a Place demands, Inlisted likewise in the venal Bands; Little his Dad, the honest Merchant, thought, He would to vote for an Ex?se be brought. Lo! in the next Place, an embroider'd Knight, By a Red Ribbon made a Proselyte; Where Reason and Religion would have fail'd, Strange Force of Fancy! a Red String prevail'd. But C?y had almost escap'd Song, Tho none more zealous in the gloomy Throng, To trample down what's Right, and vindicate what's Wrong. Persist, gay Statesman, in these arduous Toils, So shalt thou have thy Share of Patriots Spoils. Young Noodle next demands Pre-eminence, Who, like his Dad, 's at open War with Sense; But then for Courage who'll with him compare, When, with two Noodles more, he cudgell'd one poor Player. Foremost among the venerable Band, Of solemn Dunces, behold B? stand, A Saint who never broke the Seventh Command. What tho he's covetous of worldly Pelf? His Neighbour's Wife he loveth as himself. But being fearful of the Morning Air, He leaves to tatter'd Crape the Drudgery of Prayer. Nor let sagacious W? be forgot, In florid Speech who seconded the Plot, For which poor Atterbury went to Pot. And well it was that Prelate was sent hence, Who was fast-leagu'd with Wits and Men of Sense, Sworn Foes to Appius and his blundring Tools, Under whose Auspices this Isle he rules. Fain would I, H?, spare thee the Disgrace, Of shewing with such Blunderers thy Face, But thy Enquiry dooms thee to the Place. Next Time you write, let Reason guide your Pen, Nor prostitute your Character for Gain; Yet have you not the Prize for which you waited, Yo hop'd, like Enoch, to have been translated. In the next Place comes equitable ?, That uncorrupted and Law-learned Sage, At once the Shame and Glory of the Age. He ne'er, by arbitrary Statesmen, gain'd, The Laws t'oppress unhappy Culprits strain'd; Nor did the Cause of Liberty betray, By fining Pris'ners more than they can pay, Witness poor ? but the other Day. After him ? justly claims a Place, Than whom none ever more the Bench did grace; On publick Festivals, whilst Bonefires blaze, His City Charge shall be remembred to his Praise; Babes yet unborn shall eccho out his Name, Whene'er a R?e's committed to the Flame. But not to dwell on these Great Men too long, Others of equal Worth demand our Song. View yonder Levee, where such Numbers wait, Right cringing Slaves, true Dunces of the State; Appius o'er all has equal Influence, Some Titles gain'd, some Places, and some Pence. 'Mongst these S?A?'s comes his Court to pay, Careless of Fame, so Profit leads the Way; Not so his Sire, who all his Posts resign'd, Rather than give one Vote against his Mind, Or with sworn Foes against his Country be combin'd. Are my Eyes true, is S?e also stray'd; Has he the Cause of Liberty betray'd! My Sight deceives me sure, it cannot be, 'Tis not in Nature possible, that he, Whose witty Ancestor, Apollo's Care, Proclaim'd against all Dunces mortal War, And made for Liberty such glorious Stands, Should list with Appius in his venal Bands. Content to bear his Yoke, and own his Sway, See R?d too, the Blunderer, obey; And certainly he judges very right, His Yoke is easy, and his Burden light; I mean, to Those who for him vote or write. Neither does M?rs, or d?G?y disdain, To crowd his Levee, and enlarge his Train; But sure his ? will not always reign. Tho now he, like an over-bearing Flood, Sweeps down before all that's Great and Good. 'Tis not to Brib'ry or to Cunning giv'n, To ward off Justice, when 'tis edg'd by Heav'n. Full oft a Meteor, tho exhal'd to th' Skies, Falls to the Earth, and falling, stinks and dies. Who next of Fortune's Fav'rites claims a Place? Dunces I sing, a servile gloomy Race, And see, in Shoals, how they advance apace. P?, the Offspring of a God-like Sire, Who never gave one single Vote for Hire, Older and Wiser grown, thinks 't no Disgrace To prostitute his Conscience for a Place. Nor shall enribbon'd L?r 'scape my Song, Inlisted likewise in the venal Throng; Had Great Sir Philip liv'd in this our Day, He would not have inlisted thus for Pay. T?e next appears, a supple Wight, Deep-learned in Intrigues and Deeds of Night. His Country's Good, had he but half so well Study'd, in Senates how would he excel? Fain would I spare the Youth, who, nobly born, Accepts the Spoils from honest C?n torn; His Sire to Appius bore invet'rate Hate, And would have crush'd him, if not snatch'd by Fate: How much more Christian than the Sire the Son, To help, support the Man his Father tumbled down! M?d next to be enroll'd requires, Whom his Sire's excellent Example fires; Go on, bright P?r, and tread in Paths the same, So shalt thou with him merit equal Fame. Nor shall the P?r escape, of Fame assur'd, Whom wav'ring late a Ribbon blue secur'd; Pleas'd with his Leading-String, he's chang'd in Note, And will for Appius either speak or vote. L?n next appears to swell my Song, I'th' mercenary Bands inlisted long; Regardless he of popular Applause, Still drudges servile on in Appius Cause. Next T?n the upright comes in View, Always to Int'rest and to Appius true; Happy the Nation where such Chiefs preside In Council, and her awful Senate guide! But see C?s in the hireling Train, Inur'd to vote, as Switzers fight, for Gain. Poor Britain! which such Troops are forc'd to pay, As vote thy Liberties each Hour away. See self-admiring O? next advance, Skill'd in his Youth t'excel in Dress and Dance; What now do those Accomplishments avail, When caught in Marriage-Trap he hangs his Tail! Justly has Heav'n ordain'd to scourge the Fool, Who was a Tool of Pow'r, should be a Woman's Tool. See H?t next in League with Appius join'd, Erst his sworn Foe, tho since he's chang'd in Mind; Brought over by a P?ge and a String, A Ribbon sure's a strange perswasive Thing. Him M?n follows close, a servile Hack, As Pack-Horse Pack-Horse follows in a Track; To Show and Title both alike inclin'd, 'Gainst Truth and Reason both alike combin'd; Both by the self-same Arguments were won, With both a P?ge did what Sense could ne'er have done. L?l and M?n next to him succeed, So from one Fly-Blow Scores of Maggots breed; To Appius' Favour both have like Pretence, Since neither ever deviates into Sense, Nor can one of the other claim Pre-eminence. On titled Dunces I have dwelt full long, Dunces of meaner Rank now claim my Song. Tho not so great in Rank, not less in Fame, Nor of less Use in playing Appius' Game; All right Court Cards, and ready at Command, For if his Game you rightly understand, The Knaves are still the best Cards in his Hand. Amongst these E?s demands the foremost Place, E?s not dejected by his late Disgrace; Second in Guilt to none but Appius, as in Brass. Happy was it for him, the other Day, That Appius, his great Patron, had the Sway; And bent his trusty Favourite to save, Exerted all his Pow'r to skreen the Knave; Warded the Storm from off his guilty Head, And let it burst on others not so bad. Thus the fam'd Jonathan, to Thieves well known, Would daily truss up Villains not his own; Whilst his own Gang effectually he skreen'd, And with them good Intelligence maintain'd: Go on, my trusty Reprobates, said he, Nor fear a shameful End at Tyburn-Tree; Whilst you are brisk and ready at a Job, Securely under my Protection rob; Nor doubt your Safety, or my Influence, Whilst Bribery prevails, and you bring in the Pence. B?h the venal next let's celebrate, The servile Tool of ev'ry Knave of S?te; With whom nor Principle nor Honour weigh, When put in Competition with C?rt-Pay. But B?n see, to Wit turn'd Renegade, And, join'd with Dunces, has Wit's Cause betray'd; Well judg'd; who would not prefer B?s to Bays? And a good heavy Purse to empty Praise. In the next Place, P?s and B?r view, Brave Sons of Mars! to Gold and Appius true; Who that these Tars no Conscience use can say, Since, as they cannot fight, they'll vote for Pay? To B?y next let's turn our wondring Eyes, Who, than his honest Ancestor more wise, And by a P?ge tempted, votes for an Excise; Tho nothing the proud Title should him cost, He'd find it dearly bought at Honour lost. O blasting Sight, do I a C?ll see, Combin'd against his Country's Liberty? 'Tis well great M?o' sleeps now in his Grave, Who fought so oft our Liberties to save; How would he blush now were he to arise, And see his Kinsman vote for an Ex?se! D?n next appears, a supple 'Squire, Whom wise Men laugh at, and whom Fools admire; Fain would the wealthy Dunce a Wit be thought, But that's a Title is not to be bought. Nor need there greater Proof that he's no Wit, Than that with Appius he's a Favourite. There Pigmy E?be view, with Aspect grave, To Appius and to Avarice a Slave; In vain by Gravity for wise he'd pass; The gravest of all Creatures is an Ass. Next H?y's doughty Second see appear, As void of Sense, as he would seem of Fear; Blest Appius! who such Champions maintains, They need not dread the knocking out their Brains. Yonder advances F?ue the Dull, To Appius an obsequious humble Tool; Else would not he a Brother see opprest, And yet no gen'rous Anger fire his Breast. Go on, my supple C?l, shut thine Eyes, And to thy Int'rest all Things sacrifice; So mayst thou rise in Time to be a Chief, And in terrorem hang each petty Thief. Him follows close a Dunce of Quality, To side with Appius drawn by Sympathy; O had he on that Day our Laureat been, When th' Excise-Bill fell, ne'er to rise again! Then should he write its Fun'ral Elegy, And mourn its Downfal from a Hollow Tree. Advance, L?p, nor need'st thou be asham'd, To be with such a Tribe of Dunces nam'd; Thou who alone H?r?o didst excel, And for Politeness bear away the Bell; Thou who didst let admiring Nations see, A Hottentot of English Progeny, The Proof of Appius' great Sagacity. With M?t my Pen I will not foul, But leave him to be well chastis'd by C?e; For sure that Wretch deserves no better Fate Who gives his Vote to ruin a free State. How prone to swerve from Virtue are Mankind! O?w behold with Appius combin'd! How are our Hopes by this Alliance cross'd! The Man of Honour in the Courtier's lost: In Time he may the curs'd Exchange deplore, Of Innocence giv'n up for Wealth and Pow'r. P?y the next claims in our Verse a Place, Fast-leagu'd with Appius and his Wandring Race; How weak is Blood, where stronger Int'rest draws! Else would not he support the servile Gause; Nor would his honest Brother grieve to see, So near a Friend, so link'd with Infamy. Him Y?k and T?t follow Hand in Hand, Firm Friends to Appius and his hireling Band; O Eloquence and Learning misapply'd! With Vice to vote, with Villany to side! Still there remain unsung a num'rous Crew, To Dulness and to Appius ever true, Whose worthless venal Names should I rehearse, My Ink 'twould stain, and 'twould defile my Verse; Unsung then let them still remain for me, I am not fond to rake in Infamy.
