      <field name="fulltext">Such as are troubled in Publyque afayres, About common welthes by offyces and cares: In faythfull freindshyp can neuer abyde, For so sayth Tully the thinge hath ben tryde.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Edward lenynges to the Reader. The wyes Phylosopher Arystoetell doth saie, Freindship is a vertue most incomparable, And Tully doth his wordes not denaye, Sayenge it is a thinge most commendable: Both fyrme and sure, nothing deceyuable For freinship with out vertue in no man can remaine Thus the wyse Phylosopher Tully telleth plaine. Tully defyneth freindship on this wise also Sayenge it is none other thing at all But a perfecte consent of thinges for to kno Whych as well to God as to men doth befall, Beneuolence and charitie imbraced of great and small Nothing is more comodious while men on earth do liue Then this except sapience which God to man doth giue. Then which definicion is excelent and true For in God and all thinges which of God doth come Nothing of more estemacion doth ensue Then Loue called in latin Amor all and some, Amicitia desending and coming of Eum In english called Freindship which taken a waie The life of man wyll soone fall in decaie. No house can stand in quiet peace and reste No feilde can bringe his fruyte in due season If hatred and enuie doth dwell both East and Weste, All men may iudge then parfectly by reason Fynally of man is iudged by discretion He semeth from the worlde to take a way the sume, That from mans life wold freindship daue vndon. Syth frendshyp then to mans lyfe is so pure Then all other vertues it doth far excell. And onely in good men remaines, thys is sure, From whose harte and mynde no paine maie excell: But fyrmly and sure within them doth dwell, So that therof none euyll may proceede Ne cause of thynge which euyll is in deede. Betweene all men that be good can not be Amitie Alwayes abydynge without some decente, Except they seme both of on quallitie, Fourmed all a lyke by natures pretence: In maners and study both equally bente, And specyally in maners, for that is the thynge Whych knytteth the hartes both of one lykinge. For Grauytye and Affabylytie be laudable both And qualyties highlye to be had in estemacyon, So is Seuerytie and Placabylytie forsooth Magnyfycence and Lyberalytie is of the same fassion And yet Frugalitie by all wyse mens Oracyon Which showeth a lyfe both moderate and sober, Is hygher extolled then any of the other. Yet wheare these vertues and qualyties bee Seperately a sundre amongst persones manye, Assembled together by tranquilitie May well be parfecte concorde trulie, But freyndshyp is there sildome verelye, For that which the one for a vertue imbraceth, The other contemninge his minde, it neglecteth. And there wheare descension of mindes doth appere By reason can stande no parfecte Amytie, Syth freindship is a consent entyre, Of will and desires in one like quantytie: Therfore is syldome seene for a certeinty, That freyndshyp betweene such parsons should bee, Whych in theyr desyres can nothinge agree. Those which be liberall of harte and deede Withholdyng nothinge from them whom they loue Whearby increase of loue doth proceede, And in them that be constante and wyll not remoue: Is neuer mystruste nor suspection to proue, Ne anye surmysynge of euill reporte Can drawe theyr affection from them in any sorte. And by this thinge is freindship made sure Parpetually for euer both firme and stable, But if like studye or learnynge procure Theyr mindes in one thinge to be delectable: Ioyeing to those vertues agreable, Freindship much rather doth happen to stande By mutuall agrement with faithfull bande. Nothinge euill or vycious to man In faithfull freindship doth happen to bee, The first election made of freindes than Receueth all the importaunce truely, Wherfore it wolde be done nothing rashely, But with a longe proofe and great deliberacion Deseruyng parfectly his former trade and fashyon. For oft times by fortune it comith to passe A man now in welthe and great prosperytie, Is brought in a momit much worsse then he was Standinge in peryll and great extremytie: Freyndshyp oft times then faileth verely As Ouydes sweete sentence to vs doth declare Hereafter folowyng with wordes good and fayre. Whylste fortune thee fauoreth, freindes thou hast plenty The time being troublous thou art alone, And Coluers haunt houses made whyte and dayntie To the ruonous Towers almost commeth none: Of Emotes innumerable, vnneth thou findest one In emptie barnes wheare fayleth substaunce, Happeneth no freinde in whom is assurance. But if amonge manie one chuse to be found In all cares of fortune hys freyndshyp to holde, The prayse of hys nane shall highly rebounde And is more of valew then syluer or golde, Or any comodytie that els can be tolde, Of kyndred and blood none is so c?mendable As one parfecte freynde in nothynge deceyuable. For Tully saith from kyndred and lyne Beneuolence may soone be taken awaye, But freyndshyp whych neuer at naught doth repine Can neuer be seuered by night nor by daye: So though beneuolence in kindred doth staye, Yet the name of kindred doth alwayes stand styll But take it from freindshyp and cleane it doth spyll. I am not able of freindshyp to showe A true definycyon in euery thinge, Though all a whole yere my wyt I bestowe In such like sentences still wrytinge, With manie auncient Hystoryes searchynge Whearin I shulde fynde such stoore to indyte That in a large booke I scarce coulde them write. But gentle Reader I praie you haue pacience In this malabour not worthy of praise, Acceptinge well my mynde and dillygence, Occupyenge my pen thus on many idle daies: Wherby some profit doth come manie waies, For vnto all men it showeth the vertue Of amytie and freyndshyp parfecte and true. Many yonge wyts desyre for to read Hestoryes olde, in Mecter delectable, Of dyuers good Knyghtes and such as be dead, Leauyng behynde them a fame much commendable, Yet is the readynge therof nothinge profitable, But in this small treatice a man maie beholde, How freyndshyp is better then syluer or golde. The vertue of freindshyp in this shalbe seene Betweene two parsons most worthy of fame, More truer in freinship hath neuer none bene Then these Alfagus and Archelaus by name: Many yeres lyuynge wythout anie blame, The one of Rome, of Carthage the other Lyuing more truly then brother and brother. And vnto God with all my harte I praye That by this treatice some may ensample take To learne to kepe theyr freinship night and daie, When to theyr freindes lyke yromyse they do make: In wealth and wo them neuer to forsake, But now a daies I fere but few men do lyue That will vnto theyr freyndes such freinshyp gyue. And thus concludinge my simple Preface Most hartely I pray the Readers all, If in this booke parhaps by my trespasse Some thyng amysse to them doth befall: Showe me my faulte and mende it I shall Desyrynge no man my worke to disdayne Though symple it be and done with small payne. FINIS. The famous Hystory of Alfagus and Archelaus. Wherin is declared the true fygure of Amytye and Freindshyp. Cap. i. In Rome sumtyme a Knyghte dyd dwell, Both noble, wise and good, Hys stocke of auncyente Romaynes were, And not of Rascall blood: Lypodus hyghte thys noble man for so mein dyd hym call, Beloued he was of all folkes in the Cyttie, great and small. A Ladye had thys noble Knighte of worthy stocke and fame, Betweene whom God a sonne dyd sende Alfagus was hys name: A comely Chylde and fayre he was as any man myght see, In learnyng apte to euery thynge whych taught to hym myght bee. This knight therfore when as his sonne to lawefull yeres ded growe, He thought how he by vertuous trade myght make hym wysdome knowe: But at the laste by musynge longe he vnderstood right well, Of Carthagye that noble place much praise he harde men tell. How that was cheefe and fountayne of all wisdome and all grace, Next vnto God all prudence came and doctrine from that place: And noble men from far aboute theyr Chyldren thether sent, And Lypodus this knight therfore euen of the same intent. His sonne Alfagus brought foorth with to Carthagye, that hee, Myght lerne good letters and also a Scholler there to bee: And hosted him with one who was an auncyent man and wise, A Senatour of the Cittie who good councell dyd deuyse. Of Carthagie that noble place and Cyttie of great fame, The cheifest ruler then was hee and Olympus was hys name: Thys Olympus had a sonne also whom Archelaus men dyd call, In euery parte both hande and face like Alfagus was hee all. Theyr age was equall both as one agreeinge iust and ryght, Theyr faces so proporshined both a lyke in all mens sight: That no man coulde deserne the one and say this is the other, They were not know? but by their names of father nor of mother. And as these two yonge gentlemen agreid lyke in lymme, Alfagus Archelaus vnto and Archelaus to him: So in shorte space acquayntaunte grewe the one so to the other, That inwarde loue oprest theyr hartes and eche one called brother. Theyr willes and Appetites both in one so God had congulated, That neuer since the worlde began like them was none created: At one time they together went to study and to learnynge, At one time they at meales also tooke both a lyke refresshynge. They both delyted in one kynde of doctryne, and therby They profyted and were therwith both learned equally, And to conclude, together they with learnynge so increased, That in shorte tyme to them myght be in Carthage none compared. At length deseast Olympus (which was) Archelaus father dere, For whom Alfagus as well as hee dyd mourne with heauy chere But then Archelaus after that his father was deseased, To all men knowen he was wyth goods and ryches much increased. Wherfore to hym was profered ryche maryges many a won, With maydens fayre and bryght, but hee set not hys minde theron: And he then beinge rype of yeres of parsonage with all, Ryght well be set in euery lymme a comely man and tall. Wherfore his freindes and kynsmen all exhorted hym that hee, After this counsaile set his mynde to wed some fayre Lady: To the intente his lynage hee myght so increase ther by, But this yonge man his hart had set so on Philosophy. And on his freind Alfagus to his loue he set so sure, That if he shuld mary he thought it colde not styll indure, But that he shuld leaue of from one and cleaue another to, Wherfore longe tyme he did delaye the thinge with much a do. And would not consent to theyr mynde for ought that they colde saye, How be it, still they woulde not rest to moue hym daye by daye, To mary one that myght hym please and gyt some Childe her by, Which myght inherit and haue his lande when he shuld chaunce to dye. So at the last he graunted, because hys freindes on hym so sore, Euen by importunat callynge on styll dayly more and more, And partly by the aduyce and mynde of Alfagus hys freind dere, And by dysyre of many mo he drew theyr pourpose nere. Consentynge for to mary one in whom he myght delyght, And in all thinges vnto hys mynde ryght pleasaunt in hys syght: Wyth whych wordes all hys freindes &amp; kyn was wondrous glad in hart, And busyly for hym a none eche one dyd showe hys part. And sought wheare they myght fynde a mayde for hym right faire and good, Of like yeres vnto hym, and of some worthy house and blood, So longe they sought that at the last, a mayde they dyd espye, Of parsonage, maners, and in age in excelent bewtie. A comely damsell and a tall in equall stature pyght, With eyes as graye as glas, and skynne most lyke to snowe was whyte: Of equall yeres shee was to him in vertuous maners taught, Of noble blood full riche also no better myght be sought. Thys Ladye thougt they good, for such a gentleman of kynde, They thought her apte for hym, and hee in her myght please hys mynde: When Archelaus freyndes and eke the maydens freindes also, Had talked all theyr minde, and when eche one theyr wyls dyd knowe. And on the couenauntes were agreed how the maryage should bee, They gaue Archelaus chounsaile that the mayden he shuld see: And ofte repayre to her, so that he myght ryght well at ease, Knowe with his hart if that shee wyth her beautie might hym please. Archelaus goeth to see his Ladie, Who pleaseth him right well. Hee carieth Alfagus with him to see her, who is so taken in her loue that hee, lyeth sicke with intollerable paine. Cap. ii. After the counsayle of his freindes Archelaus did agree, And went without delaye anone, hys Ladye for to see: Who in all partes hee found to bee so pleasaunt to hys mynde, That if hee shoulde seeke all the worlde none better coulde hee finde. Nor to his hartes desyre hee thoughte, myght be founde one so meete, Wherfore anone with louynge wordes to her hee spake full sweete: And sayde fayre Lady is your mynde to haue me for your make, And can you fynde within your hart all other to forsake. Saue onely I, and cleaue to mee how say you Lady bryght? Shee aunswered hym, (&amp; sayd) for sooth all that is in my might, I am content to do your mynde my hartes desyre is so, And thus when they had talked longe and eche theyr loue dyd know. Archelaus dyd returne agayne to Alfagus hys freinde, No loue of Lady in the worlde myght take hym from hys mynde: Yet often tymes when to study they together both dyd go, Many times Archelaus when Alfagus dyd not know. Stale secretly away, and to hys Lady did resorte, That he with her in pastyme good myght make some pleasaunt sport: And not withstandyng the great loue whych to hys freynd he bare, Yet ofte tymes to hys Lady he on this wyse dyd repayre. But at the laste when shamefastnes surmounted in his brest, Wythin his harte he coulde not haue at no tyme quiet rest, Untyll hys secret iourneys were vnto Alfagus tolde, Wherfore anone these wordes hee spake and said with courage bolde. Dere freinde Alfagus so it is my freindes on mee did lye, As you do knowe ryght well ynoughe to wed some fayre Ladie: That so I myght increse the stocke of mee and of my father, Howe be it (god dooth knowe) with you to byde yet had I rather. What then? it is so nowe that I, haue chosen a Ladye bryght, Who to my harte in all thynges is ryght pleasaunt in my sight: And ofte tymes haue I stolne awaye, from you vnknowne till nowe, When as wee were at study both and ye wyst nothynge howe. To goo and see her whom I loue shee doth mee so delyghte, For wyth her beautie my whole harte is fyxed daye and nyght: To morowe therfore will I go about this tyme and tyde, And you with mee shall go that theare to gether wee maye abyde. An houre or twayne and passe the tyme wyth some solace and playe, Where as you maye beholde and see my Ladye freshe and gaye: Alfagus answered hym and sayd I am ryght well content, To go with you my freind I thinke the tyme no better spent. And fayne I woulde beholde the mayd you prayse so much to me, For since you spake fyrst of her I haue longed her to see: Thus when they talked had awhyle the nyght on them did drawe, Wherfore to rest they went anon when best theyr tyme they sawe. Thus when the darknes had his course, and Phebus beames so bryght, The restles Sonne I meane did shewe vppon the yearth some lyght: The mornyng sonne, w? shininge beames all landes hath ouer spred, And from the skyes the droppynge shade, of nyght awaye was fled. Alfagus rose, and longed to see the mayden bryght of hewe, Aryse vp Archelaus he sayde that I maye go with you: To see her whom you praysed so my harte is very fayne, Euen nowe anon Archylaus sayde wee will go thether both twayne. Where with he rose and so they bothe anon to gether did go, But how they sped, if you wyll heare I wyll vnto you sho: Forth goeth these two young gentlemen and when one houre was spent, They came wheras the mayd dyd dwell and into the house they went. Who of the Damsell was anon receaued ioyfullye, But as soone as Alfagus had vppon her set his eye: Beholdynge her most comlye face with parsonage demure, Adorned all in bewtie, and In espectable pure. Her lyppes as red as anye Rose nothing there was amys, With sober countenaunce myxed all with maydenlye shamefastnes: Her taulke so sweete and pleasaunt was for Alfagus to beholde. That with the syght of her anone hys sprytes were very colde. Hys harte was persed thorow cut blynde Cupyds darte with all, And wyth whych wound for deadly smart, almost on sounde did fall: So viment and so ferce his payne increased more and more, Wyth styll beholdynge of that mayde, which stood hys eyes before. That nerther the great studye of Phylosophy, nor yet The remembra?ce of his most dere freinde, Archelaus any whyt: Could once wythdrawe that vnkynde loue out of his harte and breste, But more and more his payne dyd growe not knowynge what waye to test. But that of force hee must needes loue and that inordynatelye, That Lady whych Archelaus his friende had chosen to marry: All be it wyth incredyble paynes he kept hys thoughtes vnknowne, Untyll they both returned were and to their lodgynges gone. The myserable Alfagus then wyth wandrende hym selfe a syde, As though in secret studye hee intended to abyde: All tormented in sorowe and care wyth loue oppressed sore. Uppon his bed hee layed him downe tormented more and more. Rebukynge there him selfe of moste vnkynde and spytefull hate, For with the syght of that fayre mayde whych hee had seene of late: Hee had conspyred such great euyll agaynste hys freinde so dere, Who had hym loued so wonderous well in faythfulnes many a yere. Alas what euyll tyme (quoth hee) was it when I was borne, Alas for c?mynge to thys place why had I not forsworne: Alas my father, wherfore brought you mee here to thys place? Why dyd you not keepe mee at home out of thys wretched case. Alas that euer I dyd acquaynt my selfe wyth one so true, As you my freind Archelaus are but I agayne to you, Most lyke a brutyshe beast vnkynde from Nature gone awrye. And haue deserued of your part, great hatred to imploye. And w? those wordes deepe sighes &amp; sore, out from his harte hee sente, That euer hee came to Athennes oft tymes hee dyd repent: Thus styll in dollour and in care he tombled and he toste, That lytle lacked it of his hart to be in peces brast. But vnto no man durst he once dysclose his secret sore, So that at length most greuous paines increased more and more: And forced him would hee or not styll on his bed to lye, Receauyng nought wherwith he myght haue him sustayned bye, No sleape at all nor rest hee tooke no sustinaunce nor foode, He would receaue wherwith hee might haue done his bodye good: That hee so feble was and faynt so weake of lymme wyth all, That in his legges, his bodye to beare no strengthe there was at all. Archelaus goeth to see Alfagus, who lyeth sicke for loue: to whome Alfagus confesseth all the cause of hys sycknes, greatly repronynge hym selfe of vnkyndnes. Cap. iii. To Archelaus was tolde a non parte of Alfagus care, How he full sicke to bed was gone and almost in dispayre: Wyth whych wordes he was sore abasht and went forthwith to see, How his deere freinde Alfagus dyd, and what his payne myght bee. But when he did approch the place where as Alfagus laye, Beholdynge there his most dere friende in such paynefull araye: The red Rose collours in his face which was wont to appeere, All tourned into sallow pale with wan and heauye cheere. His red lyppes pale and almost blacke his eye lyds suncke full low, That skarce beholhyng in his face he coulde his vissage know. He myght from wepyng scarce refrayne the tears by force out braste, But then remembrynge hym agayne refrayned at the laste. Feare leaste he thoughte suche sorowfull sight might most his freind anoy, Wherfore hee tourned backe agayne hys countenaunce vnto ioye: Comfortynge hys dere freind in all that euer hee myght do, Desyrynge hym and sayd howe came, thys great dysease in you. And why haue you byn so vnkynde not shewynge mee att all, Of this dysease which vnto you, of late tyme dyd befall: But thus vnkyndly and vnwyse to seeke your owne decaye, When as I myght by knowyng therof haue sought some helpe and waye. If any thynge for syluer or golde to helpe you myght be bought, I woulde not staye my selfe till all thys regyon I had sought: And though that it shoulde coste mee all the substaunce I coulde make, Yet woulde I thynke it well bestowed to spende it for your sake. With which woordes then the mortall sighes renued more and more, Within Alfagus harte, and he began to weepe full sore: So that abundauntlie the teares downe from his eyes did fall, And many a sorowfull syghe hee sent out from, his harte with all. The which when Archelaus saw he coulde no more forbeare, But was resolued to teares a non his harte all fyxed in care: And sayd Alfagus most dere friend do not your mynde delaye, But shewe me all and euerye deale most hartely I you pray. Alas whye are you so vnkynde that you will not disclose, Your secret sicknes vnto mee when as I did suppose: You would not haue kept backe from mee no secrete thyng at all, For I woulde haue hid nought from you what soeuer myght befall. Therfore I pray you let me know what greuous payne you haue, That I may seeke some helpe with haste you from the death to saue: For nothyng is to me so dere nor precious in my syght But for your sake hee wyll anon depart with it forth ryght. Although myne owne lyfe I should lose It would I not delay, But runne and go all that I myght for your helpe nyght and day: The whych woordes when Alfagus harde and sawe the mone and greefe, Which his deere friende Archelaus made to seeke for his releefe. All blushyng and in shamefast wyse by force as then constrayned, Unto his friend his tale he tolde and in this wyse complayned My most deere friend and faythfull mate leaue of your faythfull mynde, Call backe agayne the wordes you spake some helpe for mee to fynde. And rather slaye mee where I lye drawe out your knyfe therfore, Dyspatch my dayes that I may see the heyght of heauen no more: Most myserable wretch and Traytor falce to you my friende am I, And of all men vppon the Earth, most worthye for to dye. For lyke as god by hys great power hath formed vs as one, All lyke in euerye forme and part, for men to looke vppon: So hath he made our myndes agree in euery thynge alyke, For looke what one of vs would haue the other therto doth seeke. Our myndes and apetytes are as one they dyffer nought at all, I thynke that neuer wyth no men lyke friendshyppe dyd befall: And now so soone (alas I say) so soone this loue is gone, Good friendshyppe is excluded and of reason there is none. No doctryne doth auayle, nor man in wysdome may not truste, Nor no fydelytye in a friende in this case maye be iuste: Yea Archelaus the great truste Whych you on me dyd laye, Hath caused me for to conspyre agaynste you nowe this daye. (Alas agaynste you my deere friend) to do thys thyng vnryght, How haue I ben intangled with some foule enuyous spryght: What thyng was in your mynde alas when wysdome was awaye. Why tolde you mee of that fayre mayde which is so freshe and gay. And you haue chosen her to wyfe (alas) why did you so? Why had you not left me at home but let me wyth you go? (Ahlas I saye) where was your wyt remembrynge not at all, The great fragillitie of our loue and Natures bonde wyth all. What neede you haue regarde of me what pleasure you dyd fynde, In the beholdynge of her whome you loued in your mynde: Why would you haue me se her whom your selfe could not beholde, But with the beutie of her face your loue to her had tolde. Your mynde was fyxed and your harte was rauyshed her to see, And yet for that in all this thynge you had no mynde of mee: (Alas why dyd you so forget and coulde not thynke vppon That both our wills and apetytes hath byn alwayes as one. For alwayes that which in your eyes was pleasaunt for to see, Hath alwayes byn in euery parte in lyke sorte vnto mee: What neede more wordes Archelaus for your truste in me I saye, Hath caused me with vnkynd loue to be intrapt this daye. The raynes and pleasaunt beames most fayre ensuyng from her eyne, Whom you haue chosen for to loue hath pearst thys hart of myne: Yea the remembraunce of her and her vertues manyfold, Hath strouken me with a deadlye wound and made my hart full colde. So that I do desyre nought els but lyke an vnaynd wretche, I myght departe out of this lyfe this myserye to dispatche: As one not worthye to haue lyfe and felowshyp wyth you, My most deere friende which alway hath ben vnto me so true. But I haue ben to you vnkynde (alas) why should I lyue? And w? those wordes out from his harte full heauye syghes dyd gyue: Desolued all with teares great store which from his eyes did runne, Concludyng these his wordes in care as he had them begunne. Archelaus accuseth hym selfe of Follye. He renounceth hys tytle that he hath in the Lady to Alfagus and showeth him the way howe hee shall haue her to hys wyfe, vnwares to all his friendes. Cap. iiii. When Alfagus made an ende and had confessed all, How w? the syght of y? faire mayd what payne dyd hym befall: Hys deere friend Archelaus then as nothyng discontente, Nor yet astoyned at the thynge in which his friende was bente. But with a merye countinaunce, Alfagus did imbrace, He kyssed hym and on this wyse his woordes foorthwith did place: Why friende Alfagus at your harte is this same all the greefe? And had you thought within your harte there could be no reliefe. Alas whye? were you so vnkynde that ye would not declare, The cause of thys your payne to me but to your harte it bare: Alas why keepe you of so long and would not let me kno, Why were you so vnkynde to keepe your secret mynd mee fro. I do confesse my folly here wherwith I am attaynte, You haue disclosed my fond wyt to me in your complaynt: For shewynge vnto you the mayde wom I chose to my wyfe, I dyd remember nothyng in the nature of our lyfe. Nor how our myndes and apetytes in all thynges doth agree, Nor yet the vnytie of our hartes, remembred was of mee: Wherfore it is no man but I which hath done all this ill, Surelye I can not well excuse my selfe by reasons skyll, For who of ryght can proue that you haue trespassed at all, When wyth the mutable darte of loue your harte was strooke wyth all: Why thynke you I am such a foole which can not vnderstande, The myghtye stroake of Uenus power whom loue doth take in hande. For where shee lysteth for to shew the vyolent course of care, To presse the harte oportunatlye with panges shee doth not spare: Haue not you well resysted when to death you are neere brought: And thus in tormentes for to slake, that apetyte you haue sought. What more importunate loue of you may I requyre then, More faythfull loue in all the worlde hath neuer ben of men: And should I seeke for to expell that thyng which god hath wrought Seth she, predestinate was to you before I of her thought. If I should so thynke of this thynge my wyt were spent in vayne, What were my studye all my lyfe but foolyshe and no gayne: Shoulde I seeke for the prudent Arte Phylosophye to knowe, Nay, nay, Alfagus in my harte let neuer god do so. But surely I confesse in deede to loue the mayde as well, As any man possyble may which wysdomes arte can tell: And tooke more pleasure in my harte her beutye to beholde, Then in my landes my father lefte my syluer or my goulde. The which you know doth much abo?d in vallue for to be, Yet at my harte they are not halfe so pleasaunt vnto me: But now I know within your hart her loue surmounteth more, Then fiue tymes it hath done in me of all the tyme before. Yea without measure in your harte I know the darte doth stinge Of ragyng loue but should I thinke that were wanton lustyng: Or suddayne apetyte of your mynde delyghtyng in solace, Haue I not knowen the manner of your lyfe in euery place. How you were honest good and wyse in euery kynde of waye, Uayne dalliaunce &amp; fond toyes vnmeete your vse was not to playe: Shall I immagyn then in you, mallis, disceit or guyle, Syth you and I haue fostered ben together of longe whyle. Euen from our chyldhood vntyll nowe yet could I neuer see, But that you haue byn gentle sweete and freindelye vnto mee: Betweene vs twayne was neuer stryfe synce one the other knew, But still agreed in euerye parte to lyue lyke breetheren trewe. Nay god forbid that noble bande of friendshippe which hath ben, Alfagus and Archelaus harte enclosed all within: To be suspected anye deale of hatred and dispyte, Or any fantasye of the mynde should presse my head vnryght. Wherby the honorable loue which is betweene vs all and some, Myght hyndred bee in anie parte the mountenaunce of a crome: Nay, nay, Alfagus it is so as I before haue sayde, For by selestiall power deuyne you poynted were that mayde. God had apoynted her to you when fyrste he gaue her lyfe, That only shee should be your loue your Ladye and your wyfe: For such a feruent loue as this oppresseth not the harte, Of anye man vertuous and wyse wyth suche an earneste smarte. But by a prouydence deuyne wheare at if I should seeke, To make resistaunce anye deale to haue the thyng I leeke: I should not onelye be vniuste agaynst my friend most trewe, Witholdinge that thyng which of ryght belongeth vnto you. But also be repugnaunte frome, goddes highe determynation, Aduaunsyng vp my harte therin to make a confutacion: Which thynge shall not befounde in me by helpe of god with all, Therfore Alfagus my deare freinde dysmay you not at all. Of this the chaunce of loue now fyxte within your harte to stande, But ioyouslye do now receaue the yoake of louers bande: For I am nothyng discontente wyth this my sudden chaunce, But merueylouslye with feruent ioy my hart it doth aduaunce. Syth that it is my chaunce for you a Ladye for to fynde, Which is so greable to your harte, and pleasaunt in your mynde: Wyth whom you may hereafter lyue in great felycitie, Receauyng fruyt by Gods hygh power your chyldren for to be. Which may amplefie, and increase great honour to your name, And all your lynage wyll reioyce when they shall see the same: Wherfore I will renounce to you my tytle and my ryght, And clearly all that I shall haue, wyth that fayre mayde so bryght. I gyue it clearlye vnto you as it is geuen to me, For euer more whyle lyfe doth last your Ladye for to be: Call to your prestynate courage agayne washe cleane your vyssage whyte Amende your eyes forlorne with teares by weepyng all this nyght. Abandon all your heauye cheere the day appeareth nye, Whych you do know I dyd apoynt the mayd for to marrye: Let vs consult betimes therfore how we may bryng about, That you ryght wyselye may attayne, your purpose thorow out. And all your hole desires so for to atchyue wyth ioye, Take heede therfore vnto my wordes and marke well what I saye: You know right well that wee are bothe so lyke in euerye place, Preporshioned all in euerye lymme both bodye, head, and face. Our speach &amp; countenaunce doth agree so lyke in euerye waye, That if we were apparrelled both alyke in one araye: And both apart for to be seene yet few men could then know, Whych of vs were the other and vnto his fellow show. Also you do remember well the custome of this land, That not withstanding all these wordes by ioynyng hand in hand: The marryage not confirmed is all hoollye iust and ryght, Untyll in Chamber they be come together both at nyght: And that the husband hath put on his wyues finger a Ringe, And also doth vnlose therwith the knot of her gyrdlynge: Then is the marryage fullye knyt and they be man and wyfe, To liue so longe in one accorde as God shall giue them lyfe. Therfore will I my selfe be theare before my friendes in place, Performynge all the brydemans parte in euery poynt and case: And you I wyll in secreat hyde wheare none shall you espye, Untyll at nyght when that to bedde eche man him selfe doth hye. And then you shall conuaye your selfe in the most secreatest wyse, In to the Chamber of the mayde as I shall best deuyse: And nothyng shall the mayde espye or thynke of you a mis, Because your rayment vnto myne so lyke in all thynges is. Your parsonage also, in all poyntes will seeme vnto her sight, So lyke to myne that by no meanes shee can espie the sleyght: And shortlye geat you to the bed delay not longe the thynge, And on her fynger strayght wayes then put on your owne golde rynge. Her Gyrdle of virgynitie vndoe without delaye, Fulfyll your pleasure all the nyght as louers lyste to playe: Comforte your selfe Alfagus therfore my louing friend moste deare, With good refection and solace relyue your heauye cheare. That this cullour wan and pale your cheekes so leane and thinne, Be not the cause to let the thynge whych easely you may winne: I knowe ryght well within my mynde that when this thynge is done, And that you do enioy the mayde by me as now begonne. I shall deryded bee of all the foalke that shall it know, And all my kynred wyth dispyte theyr Irefull hate wyll show: In seekyng all the meanes they can me to expulce and dryue, Out of this Cytye in short tyme a bannyshed lyfe to lyue. And thynke me to be suche a one as hath done great out rage, By geuyng of a great reproche vnto my parentage: But god shall worke his wyll therin, my mynde is fully bente, To do the thyng that I haue sayde is all my whole intent. I force not for the furyous rage of anye spytefull foe, Ne yet what payne I do abyde by Fortunes frownyng blow: So that you my friend Archelaus may lyue in fortunes grace, And haue felycytie to increace your honoure with solace. Archelaus marriethe the Ladye for Alfagus. Alfagus c?firmeth matrymonye and lyeth with her all the night, Archelaus desireth al hys frendes to gyue eare to the Oracion which Alfagus would make. Cappit. v. Wyth this Alfagus turnde him selfe as one awakte from sleepe, And thought hee had but seene a-dreame more cares on him to heape: And doubtyng whether he had harde Archelaus speake or no, Or seene a vision in his mynde deuysed to be so. As he before had harde his friende with frendly wordes declare, But lookynge vp with stedfaste eyes ryghtwell perceaued thare: Hys friende Archelaus standyng by, with teares lamentyng styll, Lest Fortune by her fatall wheele hys hole deuyce should spyll. The wofull Alfagus set hym vp not knowyng what to saye, But comfortyng his most dere friende in all that euer he maye: Thankyng hym then for his kynde wordes which were incomperable, Refusyng it syth that he sayd I am so varyable. More better were it that there shoulde a hondred suche as I, Lyke vnkynde wretches to be slayne or some euell death to dye: Then that so noble a man as you should sustayne any ill. Or that reproche or dammage should come anye wayes you till. But then Archelaus in his armes his freind Alfagus tooke, Comfortyng hym all that he myght with many a merye looke: And therwithall dyd swere and eke protest as not dysmayd, That with glad harte al things should bee as he before had sayd. He sweetlye kyssed him also and sayd my friend most dere, All thynges shalbe accomplysht well therfore be of good chere: Alfagus then perceauyng that all thynges were fyrme and sure And that no fayned friendshyp did his faythfull friend alure. He set him vp wyth ioyfull harte ryght in his bed as he, Had felt before no payne at all, but wakt from sleepe to be: The quicke blood in his vyssage then began for to restore, Suche coloure as by nature he receaued had before. And after hee had well sustayned wyth some good drynke and meate, His feeble bodye which before had no desyre to eate, In fewe dayes was brought agayne vnto his woonted state, Lyke to Archelaus in all thynges his faythfull freinde and mate. The daye of maryage did approche ech one with busye care, Did seeke for such thynges as should neede the weddyng to prepare, Archelaus was deuysyng styll the best and surest way, How he his friend Alfagus myght in to his rowme conuaye. Now thought he this, now thought hee that as fancie did him guyd, At length he found the secretest feat, that els he myght prouyde: And shewed Alfagus all the thyng in what place hee should stande, Take heede therfore (quoth he) that you be reddye at my hande. At nyght when wee to bed shall go within the chamber dore, Behinde the cloth there is a hole where you may be full sure: And before wee to bed muste come I will conuaye you thare, So that when I shall come and brynge with me the mayde so fayre. You shall come forth behynde my backe and I will slyp awaye. So no man shall espye the sleyght because that your araye: Is lyke to myne in euery thynge your vyssage eke also, Resembleth myne so that the mayde of this can nothynge kno. Be of good cheere Archelaus sayd my friende Alfagus now, Leaue studyeng in all other thynges and thynke on nought but how: You maye accomplyshe your desyre be of good cheere therfore, The daye is come that now from death to lyfe I muste restore. The day was come and then anon the Ladye freshe and gaye, Archelaus tooke and to the churche her lead without delay: Acompanyed with his friendes and hers ryght honorable to beholde, The couenauntes were agreeid vppon and eche theyr mynde had tolde. Unto the other and anon when all thynges els was done, They hasted home where as the feast wyth great ioye was begonne: That daye they passed with much myrth and sportes in sundrye wyse, Ech man a sundrye game and playe for pastyme dyd deuise: Betweene Archelaus and the mayde such entertaynement grewe, That all men theare had great delyte their louely lookes to vewe: Praysyng greatlye Gods good gyfte syth Nature did agree, To gyue them beautie vertue and the arte of curtesye, Which were ryght excel?t in thes twayn excelling others farre, That in the Cytie of eche sorte before tymes wedded ware: What shall I say the daye was spent, and Phebus beames so bryght, Descended downe into the west where hidden was his lyght. The twyncklyng stars by wonted course appeared in the skye, And euery man and woman faste, vnto their rest did hye: Archelaus and the mayden then acompaned with her kyn, were brought vnto theyr chamber doore and as they entred in. Alfagus hydden in the wall ryght well did them beholde, And fearyng least he myght not speede, hys harte was very colde. But then Archelaus thynkyng on his friend Alfagus case, Deuysynge how or by what meanes he might come in his place. Dismissed all the foalke awaye and thankt them for theyr payne, And sayd I wyth my ladye nowe must taulke a worde or twayne: Gyue place to vs now at this tyme most hartely I you praye, To morrow wyll we passe the tyme with more disport and playe. Eche one departed them anon no wyght was left behinde, But euen Archelaus and the mayde, eche one to saye their mynde: Alfagus lyuyng still in hope, thought euery mynute a yeare, Archelaus carefull was also that Alfagus myght appeare. Howbeit he with ardent loue desired her to haue, Aboue all worldlye treasures but his friendes lyfe then to saue: He had most ardent care of all fayre mayde therfore sayd he, A little whyle I must departe I praye you tarrye me. And made as though to ease him selfe vnto the stoole he went, He to Alfagus tooke his waye nought els was his intent: Alfagus ioyfull for to see his friende Archelaus cheare, Wythout delaye came foorth anon all frustrate was his care. Archelaus stoode in Alfagus place and Alfagus foorth did go, Unto the mayd the whych as then therof dyd nothyng kno: Now is Alfagus layd in the bed he made no longe delaye, The mayden knew not whom he was and dyd him not denaye. For why? shee thought nought els but y? Archelaus had ben theare, But alfagus ioyfull was to see, that hee so well did fare: These two young wedded foalkes therfor, no longer lye they may, For ech man hyed faste to ryse so farre spent was the daye. Archelaus thought it was most meete for to disclose his mynde, Whyle all his kynred then were there no better tyme to fynde: Alfagus his deare freind therfore he vnto hym dyd caull, And placed him within the myddest among his kyndes foalke all. And all the nobles that dyd dwell in Carthagye was theare To whom Archelaus reuerence shewed desyryng them full fayre: To gyue attentyue eare a whyle that Alfagus myght discus, A secreat thyng Archelaus sayd which hee will saye to vs. Who beyng placed in his rowme amongest the myddest of all, Declared foorth such woordes to them as after follow shall. The Oracion which Alfagus made before the freindes of Archelaus, openynge vnto them the hole matter. Cap. vi. My freindes &amp; nobles of Carthage this day amongest you all, An insample is shewed vncredible which lately did befall: Which doth dyscrybe the deuyne power of honorable loue, Whose forcyng darte with deadly stroke excelleth all aboue. This loue hath brought perpetuall fame and eke great commendacion, Unto this Citie and also vnto the Grecians nacion: Wherfore you ought ryght excelentlye greate comforte for to take, And giue due thankes to God the which this ardent loue did make. If that amonge you there remayne such auncient wyse report, As had your noble progenytours which weare of the lyke sorte: For what more prayse may be to men that on the earth do dwell, Then faythfullnes, Beneuolence, and constancie whose vertues doth excell. For lacke wherof all countreyes and all Cities do decaye, Unto desolacion and ruen eke they runne without delaye: Lyke as by them also they come to great and high prosperytie, With high estate and much renowne of Prudence and felycytye. What shall I longe delaye the tyme or tarry in the thynge, Coniectyng myne intent and not to tell my hole meanyng: You know ryght well ech one of you from whence I came and howe, Unto this Cytie I was sent whearas I am euen now. And by aduenture I did fynde the house of Olympus here, Who of longe tyme a very friende, he was to me most deare: His sonne Archelaus theare I found of myne owne age and state, Who in all thynges was lyke to me hym chose I for my mate. We were so lyke in euery thynge the one vnto the other, That wee coulde not deserned be of father nor of mother: But onlye that we woulde our selues tell one anothers name, Unto our parentes and also to others shew the same. So that at length about our neckes, sylke laces they dyd taye, Of sundrye collours that they myght deserne vs by that waye: What mutuall loue and agrement hath byn betweene vs twayne. This eyght yeres alwayes since I came with Olimpus to remayne. You all be witnesses that haue byn beholders of the thynge, To se our sweete conuersacion you haue alwayes byn wandrynge: And also our consent of mynde in luste and apetye, You neuer sawe dyscorde, nor once wherin we dyd varrye: And as for my parte after that my father was deseased, Not withstandyng that to mee aboundantly ther happened: Great possessyons and houses fayre with ryches eke innumerable, And proffers of hye dignitie wyth Ladyes fayre and amyable. My freyndes and alyans eke also theyr letters to mee sente, Desyrynge mee importunately to doo as they haue mente: In commyng home for to receyue myne erytage due to me, Yea them which in the Senat now of all most auncyent be. Offered me aduauncement hye in dignitie to raygne, Amongest those which the publycke welth doth seeke for to mayntayne, I wyll not now remember of the lamentacions great, Which my most naturall mother made me homwardes to intreat, Expressyng with most tended woordes in letters to me sent, All blotted wyth teares y? which on them abundantly were sprent: Wher in shee dyd accuse me sore because I did delaye, The tyme so long and vnto her not seeke to come awaye. Sayeng that I am much vnkynde syth nature would agree, Specially now in her most neede her comforte for to bee: But yet all this within my harte could not at all preuayle, Ne to remoue Archelaus from but to the breadth of my nayle. And but that force doth me constrayne by nature so prouyded, I coulde nor may not be withdrawne for anye thynge contryued: Once from his company most sweete and pleasaunt vnto mee, Acsepte with his most gentle harte he doth therto agree. I chusynge rather for to lyue wyth hym by fatall doome, His felow and companyon to be then counseler of Roome: For which my kyndnes hath byn well aquitted nowe this daye, Or els redoubled by his helpe if I the troth do saye. Delyueryng mee frome cruell death wherto I was so nye, That of all deathes I should haue dyed a death most cruelly: And so Lachesus shoulde haue spunne my fatall thred in yayne, My pleasant yeares and youthfull dayes the fryttell yearth should gayne. I do perceaue you wonder much ye noble Athenes now To heare of thes and of atrouth no maruell is for how Or what is he so bolde of harte that durst attempte with Ire, To satysfye his cruell mynde my death for to conspire? Being a Romayne and decente of ryall Romaynes blood, Or who els thynke you would be so malicious, or so wood: To sley me? whom you all do know hath done no villanye, To any man or woman which doth dwell within this Cytye. You all shall be my iudge therin if that it be not so, For if I should mysuse my selfe you myght well therof kno: For in your syghtes I haue byn still synce to this Cytie I, Came fyrst, and in Olimpus house appoynted was to lye. Nay nay my freyndes there is no man that I herein accuse, Before you all my friendes here no such talke will I vse: I do perceaue you lysten styll and woulde desyre to kno, What man he was that dyd presume or seeke to vse mee so. With cruell deede and great dyspyte my lyfe frome mee to take, Or in lyke sort to do this facte such enterpryse dyd make It was loue, o Carthagines, euen that same loue I saye, Which as your Poettes doth declare hath wounded many a waye. The cheifest parte of all the Gods to whom ye honour gyue, The whylst they were on earth, &amp; here lyke earthly men dyd lyue: Thys loue constrayned Iupiter to swym as doth a Swan, And be transformed lyke a Bull to hyde his shape of man. Hercules eke the vanquysher of monsters great and stronge, Lyons fearce and Gyantes huge wyth bodyes large and longe: The same loue caused hym by force vppon a Rocke to spyn, Sittyng amongest the maydens clad a womans clothyng in. The same loue also which did cause the Prynces ferse and stoute, Of Greese and eke all Asya to assemble in a route: Encampyng in the fyeldes of Troy wyth many a cruell fyght, And manya storme and tempast they did sustayne day and nyght. The same loue I do say agaynst whose ferce assaultes to stryue, May no resistaunce be at all, that reason can contryue, Hath wounded me so suddenlye and stroake my hart so sore, That remediles I should haue died no man could me restore. Had not Archelaus holpen me through his freindship incomparable, I should haue ended miserabellye my wofull fyfe vncurable: I see you do desyre to know, and fayne would haue me tell, Whom where, and what she is, that I haue chosen to loue so well. O noble Carthagines in this no longer wyll I staye, But openly declare it now to you wythout delay: It is Andromycus the Ladye fayre, the which Archelaus chose, To be his wife till desteny did theyr fatall threddes vnlose. Whom he did loue most intyrlie but when his gentle harte, Perceaued loue had strouken me euen with her forsynge darte And that my loue was set as then more higher in degree, Then his and that I forced was to loue then his Lady. And that it neuer dyd proseede of wanton lust nor wyll, Neyther it of conuersation longe wherby to taulke our fyll: Corrupt desyre or fantasye he saw no sway did beare, But with the onlie sight of her so taken in the snare. That I immediatlie was strouke with most vncurable care. Desyring all that euer I myght, death to dyspatche my dayes, Prouokyng therto all I could by sundry kynde of wayes: But he then by his wisedome soone perceiued well the thyng, As I doubt not but that ye do by this my tale tellyng. That by predestinacion shee of God was geuen to mee, And not to him but that shee should my onely Lady bee: Wherto be geuyng place as one both faythfull wyse and iuste, Estemyng more our freyndshyp then a womans loue and luste. Wherto he was endused more by his freyndes wyll and mynde, Then by the vyolence of Cupids darte constrayned after kynde: Wherfore ryght wyllingly to mee his intrest he dyd gyue. The whych he to the damsell had that so his freynd myght lyue, And it is I (Alfagus) truly which did the mayden wed, I put a Ryng her finger vppon, and went with her to bed: Of shamefastnes her Gyrdle then foorthwith I did vntaye, By her I haue lyne all this nyght what would you haue me saye. I haue confyrmed matrymonye and made her now a wyfe, She is myne owne and I am hers while God shall lende vs lyfe: At these wordes they whych present were began to murmure fast, And on Archelaus daynusly full greuouse lookes did cast. Then Alfagus spake agayne and sayd why looke you on him so, Leaue of your grudgyng countenaunces and menassynges which you sho: Towardes my freind Archelaus for he hath done to you all, Great honour and no deede wherby reproch to hym should fall. I tell you he accomplysht hath the hole partes of afryend, And that loue which was most certayne he hath done to the end: He knew in Afrycke he myght fynde another Ladye bryght, As fayre and eke as ryche as shee in whom he myght delyght. And one in whom perchaunce he might haue better consolacion, Then to this whom he dyd not fyrste agree with contentacion: But such a freend as I was hee hauyng respect and mynde, Unto our symylytude and eke our longe approued kynde. Also of my condycion and estate hee was sure, Neuer for to fynde the lyke while his lyfe did indure: Also the damsell suffereth no dispargement in her blood, Nor hinderaunce in her marryage but hath one as ryche in good. And rather is aduaunced more to dignitie by mee, But to my freind Archelaus would I, no disprayse should bee: Consyder noble Lordes also that I did not her take, My father lyuyng when therin ye myght suppression make, That as well her great ryches as her beautye did alure, Me for to take her for my wyfe and so my harte procure: But now my father is disseased in her I take delyght, And ioyne my selfe with faithfull loue to be hers daye and nyght. When I do farre exceede her in possessyons and also, My substance farre surmounteth hers as you ryght well do kno: When the most noble men of Roome and eke of Italye, Desired in my felowship to keepe mee companye. Ye haue great cause therfore to thanke Archelaus of this thyng, And as you ought of ryght you should in him haue reioysyng: And not to cast such angrye lookes extollyng so therby, This kyndnes shewed vnto mee, by hym wrought wonderouslye. Wherby of mee and all my blood such freindship hath he wonne That neuer better frendes myght be synce firste the world begonne And to your Cytie thorow me such hap now may you haue, That from your foes through all y? worlde, ryght well wee shall you saue. The which thyng well consydered you myght for Archelaus sake, In lykenes of hym with fine gould a comlye picture make: And in the cheefest place of all your Citie let it stande, Uppon a Pyller that all men which dwelleth in the land. May haue in minde our freindship great that is incomparable, And how vnto this Citie there may benefyts come innumerable: But if that this perswasion maye nor can not satisfie, Your apetyte but that ye wyll imagen now therby. Any thynge to the damage of Archelaus my freind so dere, When that I am departed hence leauyng hym wyth you here: To God the creator of all thynges, my vow here I do make, That as I shall haue knowledge therof in all ha?st? for his sake. Hether I shall resort and bryng thinuinsible powre of Roome, Reuengyng hym agaynst his foes with such a cruell doome: That all Afrycke therof shall reporte and speake perpetuall shame, Unto theyr owne reproche and eke dishonour of theyr name. And therwithall Alfagus and Archelaus stoode vpryght, But all the other that was theare of Alfagus stood in flyght, Dyssemblyng all theyr mallyce and made seemabelly their cheare, As they contented in all thynges to Alfagus myght appeare, Alfagus is sent for to Roome. Archelaus is banished his countrey by hys kyndred. After Alfagu, departyng hee is fayne to beg hys bread, and so poorelye commeth to Rome, to seeke Alfagus, he thinketh him selfe dispised &amp; entreth in to a Barne, lam?ting his fortune. Cap. vii. Soone after thys by aforrtie of the Senate and people of Rome, Alfagus sent for was that he wythout delay myght come: Home to theyr Citie and ?receaue? his fathers dignitie, Which seyng needes he must obaye did graunt them willynglye. Appoyntyng them a daye when he without fayle woulde be theare How be it for Archelaus his dere freinde he tooke much care: And sayd my louyng freind most dere ryght ioyfull should I bee, If that you would forsake this place and go to Roome with mee. The one halfe of my landes and of my goodes I will you gyue, Both vnto you and to your heyres so long as they shall lyue, In feloship styll we wyll remayne tyll desteny doth denay, Lachesus for to spinne her threede our fatall lyfe to stay. But then Archelaus had in mynde consyderyng therwithall, How necessarye his counsell myght bee what thing so myght befall: Unto the Citie of Carthagye by many sundrye wayes, Remembring that his famylie thear lyued manie dayes. And howe his bounden duetie was the Citie to mayntayne, And for the common welth to seeke some prophete or some gayne: Wherfore his freind Alfagus hee desyred to be still, For I (quoth he) may not depart how be it with ardent will. I do desyre your companie more then anie earthlye wight, Great greefe it will be vnto mee when I forgo your syght: Alfagus then perceauing that no reason it should bee, His freind Archelaus should depart out of his owne countree. Consideryng how his counsell myght the Citie well vpholde, As other sage and wisemen dyd in auncient tyme of olde: And that by nature bound he was his countreyes welth to seeke, No more he woulde perswade him then but sayd with woordes meeke. Fare well my most deare freind for now frome you I must depart, Farewell my louyng mate in whom I alwayes set my harte: Although in person I be gone yet haue mee still in mynde, If euer of me you stande in neede a sure freind shall you fynde. Archelaus kyssed Alfagus then whome he loued as his lyfe, He kyssed eke the Ladye fayre which should haue ben his wyfe: So ech one now departed is and Alfagus tooke his waye, Towardes Roome and with him rode his Ladie freshe and gay. Wher at their commyng with great ioy Alfagus mother then, Receaued was and vnto her most welcome of all men: Where as he dwelled all in myrth and great felicitie, Receauyng many chyldyren by Andromicus his Ladye. And for his wisedome and learnyng he so highlye was estemed, That no hygh office was but that with honour he atchiued: And in the noble Citie of Roome much dignitie dyd beare, Receauing loue and prayse of all the people that were there. But now let vs retourne agayne whear as wee were before, And of the spytefull kyndred of Archelaus speake we more: And of the Ladyes freyndes also whose malyce dyd remayne, Wyth secret hatred in theyr harte Archelaus to dysdayne. So that soone after Alfagus had to Roome wardes tooke his way, Malysyously with shamefull wordes they vexte hym day by day: And vterly abhorred hym for that he dyd dyspyse, To take so fytte a make (they sayde so ryche and eke so wyse. In whom he myght haue tooke delyght but that he dyd dysdayne, The frenship which to him they shewed exceptyng not their payne: But leauyng her to Alfagus whole for him they dyd prouyde, Reprouyng hym innumerably with vnkynde wordes besyde. And all that euer they could deuyse by hym to do or saye, Malysyously they sought it out and that without delaye: Fyrste they dyd exclude hym from theyr counsell and also, Not thynkyng that to be ynough so lyght to let hym go. But dyd prohybyt from hym then all honest companye, And yet not hauyng therwythall their mynde to satesfye: Finally adiudged hym not worthy for to haue, Anye of the possessions which hys father to hym gaue. Neyther yet any of the goods, which his parentes dyd leaue, Behynde them at theyr death to him as theyr gyft did bequeath: Whom he as they supposed did vnnaturally to fayne, A freindship vndiscreet and so his parentage dysdayne. Wherfore they did dispoyle him cleane of all that euer he had, And tooke the rayment from his backe wherwith he then was clad: And almost naked lyke a man whom fortune did dispyse, Out of the Citie expulced hym in the most cruellest wise. Thus is Archelaus lately one most welthyest in the Citie, Dispoyled of all that euer he had no man on him taketh pytie: One of the noblest in Carthage in dignitie he did raygne, And now of euery woman and man is had in great disdayne. For his kynde harte thus with dyspite he banyshed is for aye. And his owne countrey wher he myght haue lyued also with ioy: And as a man dismayed and tost, by fortune to and fro, He wandreth vp and downe and hath no freind his gryefe to sho. And no man coulde he fynde that would him ayed in his distresse, But wandred vp and downe alone in extreame wretchednes: Alas (qouth he) what shall I do in myserye thus remayne, O fortune why thus cruellye hast thou me in disdayne. Alfagus my freind is now in ioye he hath the mayden fayre, And for his sake I do remayne, opprest with sorow and care: If vnto hym this thyng were toulde ryght sure I am that hee, Woulde haue great sorow &amp; care for this my payne and myserie. He would reuenge me of my foes if once he might heare tell, How for his sake disdaynfullie they dyd me thus expelle I will nomore therfore delaye, my haplys hap to sho, But speedelye all that euer I can to Roome wardes will I go. And vnto Alfagus my deare freind declare my hole estate, And how my foes with me had death most cruelly now of late: Archelaus therfore tooke his waye so fast as he myght hye, Towardes Roome and all alone, withouten companye. He trauayleth day by day and is disdayned of euerye wyght, Sustaynyng hunger in the day and lieth colde all the nyght: To begge for meate and drynke then he was forced to procead, For why? he myght no more delaye hys hungrye Guttes to feede. And often when he came in place where other Palmers were, He was not knowen and therfore they on him did take no care: He could not do as others dyd with many wordes to craue, And therfore often went without when other almes should haue. Wherby he dyd oft tymes sustayne great honger payne and greefe, And no helpe coulde he haue at all but teares for his releefe: Thus many a wery daye he wente or that he could attayne, To come to Roome, but at the lengthe through traueling longe with payne. Unto the Citie is he come in hope to haue relyefe, And sayd if Alfagus I may fynde now gone is all my gryefe: For Alfagus house of euery man full fast inquireth he, And at the length is come wheras ryght well he may it see. But then beholdyng it so faire so large and eke so amyable, So Pryncely buylded and also in all thynges so delectable: He was ashamed to approche or nigh the gates to stand, He thought it would auayle him nought yf that he tooke in hande. To seeke Alfagus sith that hee was clad in such araye, In which full poorelye he had gone and traueyled nyght and daye: Wherfore to tarry thear besydes he held it for the best, And so he set him downe a whyle his weerye lymmes to rest. And sayd if fortune so prouyde that Alfagus come thys way, I will present my selfe to him to heare what he will saye: I know ryght well he knoweth me my face when he dooth see, Therfore if fortune woulde do so ryght ioyfull should I bee. Archelaus being in this thought and as he dyd deuyse, Alfagus and his Ladie hee within his gate espyse: Who issuing out immedyatly for theyr dysporte and playe, Amounted in moste pleasaunt wyse vppon theyr Palfrayes gaye. And rydynge thus for theyr solace Archelaus did beholde, But seing hym clad with such araye all ragged in euery folde: So vyle and fylthy to theyr syght his rayment did appeere, That no regarde they had to hym ne did behoulde his cheere. And so dyd passe foorth on their waye not knowyng whom it was, The which within Archelaus harte such cares did bringe to passe: That sure Alfagus he did thinke his fortune had contemned: That beyng opprest with mortall cares and heauines longe defended. Downe in a sound he fell, for why no longer might he stand, But one amongst them which stoode by did take hym by the hand: And wyth the helpe of others theare renyued him agayne, Thinkyng that he had bin sycke not knowyng hys carefull payne. And when he to him selfe was come he made no longe delay, But forthwith did depart and from the Citie tooke hys waye: Intendyng to abyde nomore, with Alfagus for to taulke, But as a wild beast wander about thorow all the world to walke. But for to rest his wearye lymmes then force did him constrayne, Within an old barne for to go that theare he myght complayne: His cruell fortune all alone the which place when he found, Without respect of death or lyfe he cast hym on the grounde, And wepyng with most dolorous cryes his fortune dyd bewayle. O thou Alfagus then quoth he why doest thou mee dysdayne? O fayned freindship why so longe hast thou dwelt with vs twayne: Myne owne kynde harte hath caused thys alas why did I so, Why let I not that vnkynde wretche haue dyed full longe a go. Alfagus I had thought thou wouldst not haue ben so vnkynde, To me, which of so many yeares hath ben thy louynge freinde: Alas my kynsfolkes nowe I fynde your wordes to be full true, I would to god that I had byn aruled then by you. Where is Alfagus thy kinde harte which thou wast wont to showe, Where is thy sweete acquaynta?ce whych betweene vs I did knowe: O cruell fortune why hast thou me thus farre in disdayne, You systers three by fatall doome why do you now refrayne? To stop my breath and send my soule where Lymbowes kingdomes lye On Limbo lake in Charons boate to take my destynie: I will no longer lyue quoth hee in this great wretchednes, But ryd this selly Ghost of myne from payne and eke dystresse. And therwithall his knyfe he drew in poynt hym selfe to kyll, But god so wrought agaynst his mynde and former wicked wyll: And by the knowledge which he had longe in Phylosophye, Consyderyng wysely euery thynge withstood that destenie. Yet oft tymes would he take the knyfe hys fatall wound to make, But wysdome did perswade him styll hys folly to forsake: And on this wyse within hym selfe alone contendynge styll, With cruell cares and tormentes thus betweene wisdome and wyll. Fatigated with longe watche and iourneyes great with all, As god would haue it in this wyse on deadly sleepe dyd fall: His knyfe wherwyth he dyd intende hym selfe as then to slaye, Fell downe hym by as hee on sleepe hys wery bones dyd laye. common robber hauynge slayne a man, entreth into the Barne wheare Archelaus sleepeth. He taketh vp the knife and putteth it in the deade mans wound, and layeth it agayne by Archelaus who beyng so founde is accused to dye. At laste he is knowen of Alfagus who taketh the fact vpon him to saue his frendes lyfe, &amp; offereth to dye. Cap. viii. The whilste he on thys wyes did lye as fortune dyd prouyde, A c?mon theefe or robber was a waytyng there besyde: To do sum vyllanous acte or deede on traueylers by the waye, Naught els his practyce was but so dyd lyue both nyght and daye. And by aduenture at that tyme a marchaunte traueylyng by, The foresayd theefe behynde a bushe dyd well his tyme espye: And sodenly the man he tooke who thought no harme ne ill, And not contented with his goods foorthwith he dyd hym kyll. Wherfore that he myght well eskape and not to be espyed, In the barne where Archelaus laye full fast hym selfe he hyed: Who when he entred was and on Archelaus dyd beholde, And that full faste on sleepe he laye as I before haue tolde. Hee looked on hys face and sawe with cares hee was opprest, And that the sorowfull teares he shed all sprynkeled had his brest: Ryght well he knew a desperate man he was, and there did lye, With sorowfull syghes so brought on sleepe, to ease his myserye. This man quoth he will serue right well to hyde my facte wyth all, And then tooke vp the knyfe which from Archelaus hand dyd fall: Puttyng it in the wounde of hym whych hee before dyd slaye, And in Archelaus hand it seite as there on sleepe he laye. So then the theefe with harte full glad departed with all speede, And tydynges to the Cytie came of this his cruell deede: Wherfore they serched dyllygently in euery hollow tree. And euery place which they suspecte the theefe might hidden bee. At laste into the barne they came where as Archelaus was, Styll faste on sleepe he laye and thoughte no harme at all alas: Poore innocent man vnto his lot this mans death nowe must fall, The searchers therfore busylie to wake him they do call. Who from his sleepe when hee awooke to sygh he did not spare, And entryng in most sorowfully to his accustomed care: Complaynyng of his fortune then as he had done before, With dolfull teares dystyllyng from his eyes styll more and more. O curssed be the tyme quoth he that euer I dyd knowe, That vnkynde wretch for wiues sake nowe I suffer all this woo: But when the officers earnestlye vnto his charge did laye, The mans death which they found therby and that he dyd him slaye. The knyfe a token is they sayde that lyes downe by thee heere For all be blooddyed wyth the wound to vs it doth appeere: Thou must needes suffer death therfore dyspatche and come at once, With ropes they bounde hym hande and foote which were brought for the nonce. He nothyng dyd denay at all but what to hym they layde, Confessed that it was euen so and helde him well apayede: That by so good lucke should escape his vyolent mynde and wyll When wyth his owne hands he did thinke his innocent blood to spyll. By lawe now shall I dye quoth hee ryght glad I am therfore, Good freindes make haste, dyspatche my dayes that I may see no more: The lyght of Sonne ne yet of skye which on the earth doth showe Theyr glystryng lyght &amp; gladsome heate on trees on earth belowe. The mournyng feyldes by lymbo lake I woulde approche to see, With those whom loue theyre deathe dyd force that place is best for mee: The offycers marueiled greatly then to see hym so content, To take his death with spedy haste intreatyng as he went. That thay wolde not delaye the tyme wherfore was tolde anon, Unto the Senate with reporte the deede of such a one: Who as you harde before was slayne and that in such a place, Was found a man in Carthage borne suspected in that case. And how they founde the blooddye knyfe in his hande being styll, And that it semed to be hee the whych the man dyd kyll: Wherfore foorthwith they dyd commaunde to brynge him to the barre, Because that time in Iudgement seate the counsell setten were. Alfagus was cheife counceller then or in lyke dygnitie, Syttyng in his royall seate wyth great felycitiy: Archelaus then moste myserable man vnto the barre was brought, With byls and staues most lyke a theefe and innocent was of thought. Of whom it was demaunded then if he the man dyd slaye, That was found dead as ye haue harde which he dyd not denaye: But in moste sorowfull maner did his fortune cursse and ban, Sayeng he was in all the worlde the moste vnfortunatest man. O myserable wretche (quoth hee) what curssed starre dyd raygne, When I my fatall thred of lyfe by nature did obtayne: I woulde to god Lachesys had my fatall thred vntayed, Before I knew that vnkynde wretche whych hath me now vpbrayed. Thus syghyng in his harte he sayd but no man could espye, For whom he sorrowed in such sorte in care and and mysery: At length one dyd demaund of hym in what place he was borne, And howe he traueyled had so farre with cotes so rent and torne. In Carthagye good syr he sayde my mother dyd me bare, And in my youthfull tyme and dayes full well I lyued thare: But fortune with her fatall wheele my good lucke dyd enuye, And therwith on Alfagus hee dyd caste a sorowfull eye. With indignacion much and braste into great syghes wyth all, Wherby aboundantly the teares downe from his eyes dyd fall: Whych when Alfagus did beholde esspyeng eke also, A marke vppon his vysage whyche of certayne hee did kno. It was Archelaus his deere freinde consyderyng therwythall, That by some euyll aduenture hee into that case dyd fall: Sodenly from his seate hee rose and kneeled on his knee, Before the iudges all and sayde my Lordes gyue eare to mee. This man my selfe I slewe quoth he of olde rancour and hate, The which renewed was by vs of malyce now of late: This man is gyltlesse of the thynge he is a straunger here, For in the eyes of all men nowe ryght well it may appeere. That he is desperate in his mynde and careth not for to dye, And to abreue his sorowes hee doth not the facte denie: He doth confesse the fact wherof he is moste innocent, And so to fynysh his sorowfull dayes that is his hole intent. Wherfore the sentence gyne on mee accordyng to my deede: And haue accordyng to the lawe some shamefull death with speede Archelaus then perceauyng that contrary to his expectatyon, His freind Alfagus did begin to make there such relacion. And how he offered for to dye some shamefull death, and so Delyuer hym from the death to whiche full lyke he was to go: He more importunatlye dyd crye for iudgement to be done, And that they would proceede on hym lyke as they had begonne. For I am he withouten fayle that dyd thys man dystroye, And as he walked by the waye withouten companye: I dyd suppose to haue of hym some Iuels ryche and fayre, And started sodeynly from a bushe before that hee was ware. Geuyng hym his deadly wound wherby I myght at ease, Serche him well in euery place to do euen as I please: But when I had destroyed hym so, it dyd me not auayle, For there no ryches coulde I fynde my purpose I dyd fayle. And beyng then ryght sore in feare least any shoulde espye, This cruell deede that I had done full faste I dyd me hye: Into the barne where I was founde to reste me for a whyle, But I had watched longe before and sleepe did me begyle. So that before I was a ware full faste on sleepe I laye, And had the knyfe styll in my hande the which that man dyd slaye: The officers will confesse it so I muste needes dye therfore, And thus he called for his death on them still more and more. Alfagus dyd deny those wordes and sayde he dyd but fayne, He doth inuent these wordes quoth hee the man he hath not slayne: For if that he had done the deede hee would haue fled awaye, And not haue tarryed in the place wher as he did him slaye. Sum other thynge was in hys mynde when he did drawe hys knyfe, By desperate minde perhappes he thought to haue ryd his owne lyfe: Is that a weapon lyke to fyght or kyll a man wyth all, No no my Lordes it is not so the knyfe is very small. And he is lyke a Palmer poore which beggeth by the waye, Not lyke a Ruffen you may see his coates are nothyng gay: It was euen I that slewe the man the cause I tolde before, Of olde hate which betweene vs was and kept so long in store. For as in that place all alone a huntynge I dyd ryde, By euell aduenture in the waye the man there I espyed: And thynkyng that no bertter tyme I myght auenged bee, But then when as we were alone and no man els to see. I drewe my sworde without delaye and vnto him I sayde, Thou vyllane nowe to fynde the here I am ryght well apayde: And therwithall on hym I layd without respect or care, That sodenly his deadly wounde he had or I was ware. Which when I sawe out of the waye I drewe hym by and by, I tooke my horse in all the haste and homwardes faste did flye: This thyng is true whych I haue sayde the lawe now let me haue, Why do ye deferre of so longe no man my lyfe maye saue. Archelaus sayd it was not so but he the man dyd slaye, Alfagus dyd withstand it tho and did hym styll denaye: Thus argued they longe tyme for death who myght the other saue, Aboundaytly theyr teares they shed with wishyng for theyr graue. Wherat the Senat and people all was wonderouslye abasht, Not knowing what the thing might mean but stoode full sore agast. The murtherer beinge mooued wyth pyttie declareth the trueth. Alfagus taketh Archelaus home to his house, much sorowful for his aduenture. The people reioyce y? the trueth is knowen, and the murtherer is set at lybertie. Cap. ix. Now he which was y? theefe in deede and murthered had the man Dyd here this thing &amp; in the prease amonge the folke dyd stand: Who then perceyuyng in his harte the marueylous great contencion, Of these two persons which was nought but of theyr owne inuencion. He knew they were full innocente in that which they dyd saye, Yet one to saue the others lyfe would not the deede denaye: And that it was proceded of a freindship most incomparable, By ardent loue on both sydes set, so fyrme and eke vnuaryable. Most veymently prouoked he was the truth for to dysclose, So through the prease he breaketh fast and to the barre he gose: Before the Senate and people all whereas without delaye, His voyce hee lyfted vp on hye and vnto them dyd saye. Ryght noble fathers wyse and sage to you it is well knowen, That I am nowe and hath ben eke full many years a gone: A comon Barator and a theefe and eke is knowen to you, Alfagus is of noble bloode and of excelent vertue. Approued alwayes for a man both noble wyse and sage, Discended as you know ryght well of great and hygh lynage: And neuer towardes man nor wyfe malycyous was his mynde, By anye outward sygne at all that euer wit coulde fynde. This other stranger eke also doth seeme a man to be, Of sober lyfe hauyng hys harte full of symplycytie: And that is more desperate of mynde for some great greuous payne, Which he hath taken in him selfe by fortunes frownyng brayne. And euydently vnto your eyes ryght well it may appeare, As also it doth vnto all the people that be here: Moste reuerent fathers in this thynge my harte doth now relent, For vnto you I do confesse these are both innocente. I am the parson which dyd slaye, and murther eke the man, Whych was found dead, now of late with colour pale and wan: I robbed hym of all his goulde and syluer euery deale, As I was wonte with others moo when as I wente to steale. And in the barne I entred then whych stood but there harde bye Thys straunger flat vppon the grounde full faste on sleepe did lye: Hauyng by hym a naked knyfe wherwith the better to speede, I put it in the dead mans wounde to hyde my wycked deede. Which beyng all be rayed with blood I made no staye ne let, But to this straunger came agayne and in his hande it set: Which thyng when I had done I made no staye ne let at all, I hyed me fast awaye and thought, no harme coulde me befall. To this mans charge I knew rightwell all men the deede woulde laye, And now I do perceiue ryght well he doth it not denaye: But pytie so hath moued my harte that needes I must confesse, This facte to saue this innocent man and seeke myne owne dystresse. Thys was my whole deuyce in deede your iudgement to withstande, But now I do commit my lyfe euen here into your hande: Rather then this noble man Alfagus should be slayne, Or that this innocent straungers lyfe would ende with greife and payne. Wherat the Senate and people all such great comforte did take, That with the noyse of ioyfull hartes the whole courte they dyd shake Alfagus ran to Archelaus then and in his armes him caught, O my moste faythfull freind he sayed why hast thou me thus sought? O why hath fortune delt with thee so cruelly in dispyte? Why wouldste thou sende no worde to me to helpe thee in thy ryght: How could you to this Citie come and would not seeke for mee, Why did you thinke I woulde dyspyse you in your myserye. No, no, Archelaus in this worlde god let me neuer lyue, If for your safegarde all my goods and lyfe I woulde not giue: Declare to mee your great myshap and how it came to passe, That you are brought to this distresse with carefull payne alas. And therwithall downe from hys eyes the salte teares fell so faste, That vnneth coulde hee speake a worde but if his harte should braste: Archelaus shed muche teares also for ioye his freinde to see, Imbracyng, kyssyng and thankyng hym wyth great fydelytie. And sayd my louyng freinde when I vnto your house shall come, I will declare my whole estate to you both all and some: Through all the Citie publyshed was this freindshyp moste incomperable, Of Alfagus and Archelaus which to them was most commendable. And so extolled and magnyfied them euen all the realme throughout, That by the mouthes of euery man theyr fame was spred about: Fynally at the instance of Alfagus and also, The sute of all the people made vnto the Senate tho. The theefe was pardoned of his facte and freely sent awaye, With charge nomore to do the lyke to no man nyght nor daye: Alfagus Archelaus lead vnto his house anon, And ryche aparell on his backe he caused to do on. Unto Andrmyca of all men most welcome then was hee, Shee kyssed and imbraced hym with much fayre curtesye: And sayde my louynge freind most deare what spytefull foes did raygne, To brynge you in such myserye by force and great disdayne. But be you of good comfort syth God hath you hyther sent, And all the goodes shalbe as yours which God to vs hath lent: Yea quoth Alfagus with my harte I wyshe it should be so, If that ye wyll abyde wyth mee and no more homewardes go. But Archelaus my deare freind fayne woulde I here you tell, The cause whye from your countrey so your foes dyd you expell. Archelaus showethe Alfagus all hys troubles and myserye, who sorowfully lamented hys case. And hauyng prouyded a great Army, went with Archelaus to Carthage, where he slew and ponished all hys foes, &amp; settyng hys freind in quyet rest, returneth againe to Roome. Cap. x. O my dere freind Archelaus sayde I will to you declare, How that dyspytefully my foes oppressed me with care: When that your Ladye Andromyca and you departed was From Carthegy where manye yeres in pastyme we dyd passe. Your Ladyes kyn and myne also conspyred such dysdayne, That all the meanes &amp; wayes they sought how that I myght be slayne: But when they culd fynd nought that way to do mee such outrage, They sought another kinde of trade theyr malyce to aswage. And fyrste expulsed me from the seate where counsell I dyd gyue, But thinkyng that was not ynoughe so well to let me lyue: Prohybetid from mee then all honest companye, And yet not beyng so content theyr wrath to pacefye. Adiudged me not worthy to enioye my fathers lande, Ne nothyng els which as you know dyd fall into my hande: For why sayd they he dooth disdaine his fathers parentage, And will not bee aruled by our counsell wyse and sage. But leaueth of the Ladie whom for him with care we sought, With shame he hath begyled vs Alfagus hath her cought: My goods and landes all that I had they tooke from me therfore, No not a garment for my backe they woulde to mee restore. But almost naked lyke a man whome fortune dyd dyspyse, They draue me from the Citie in the moste dyspytefull wyse: And no man coulde I fynde that once woulde seeke my helpe or ayde, For those in whom I trusted moste hath cheifly me vpbrayde. Then wandred I vp and downe w? care and mysery sore opprest, To begge my bread constraynde I was no place I founde of rest: At length through trauelyng long w? paine I came thys Cytie to, And ioyfull was my harte as then in hope to speke with you. But when I came your palyce nye beholdynge it so gaye, I was ashamed to approche and to my selfe did saye: I will abyde without the gates and tarrye for a space, Perhaps I shall or it be longe beholde by fortunes grace. My freinde Alfagus come this waye so then hee shall mee see, And as I was deuysyng thus the best waye that myght bee: I did espye you come and eke your Ladye in your hande, Whych made my harte full glad, and I vppon my feete did stande. That so you myght beholde me as ye passed by the waye, But as you passed by and sawe me clad in such araye: No mynde on mee ye had at all whych made mee to surmyse, That for my poore estate I had you dyd me now dyspyse. And in a sounde for care I fell opprest wyth mortall woo, But beyng then reuyued agayne I thought foorth wyth to goo: Moste lyke a beast about the worlde to wander vp and downe, And drewe my knyfe to slaye my selfe wher as nowe I was founde. But god withstood that cruell deede so I on sleepe dyd fall, And helde the knyfe styll whych I thought to slaye my selfe with all. O freynd Archelaus, Alfagus sayde my harte may not endure, To heare the wofull state you had my death it wyll procure. I am the cheifest cause of thys alas why dyd I so, O spytefull eyes, where was your syght when as you could not know My deere freinde standynge in the waye in hope to haue releefe, Alas, alas, vnto my harte how terryble is the greefe. But when Archelaus sawe hys freinde Alfagus to relent, And inwardly with doulfull teares his neclygence repente: Moste louyngly imbraced hym, and sayde my freynde be styll, Leaue of your sorowfull syghes ye make your vysage for to spyll. The thyngs which nowe are past &amp; gone no man may call agayne, Why hurte you now your selfe therfore and weepe with greuous payne: I knowe ryght well no faulte in you in this thynge was at all, But my owne neclygence causeth moste of this vnluckye fall. For if my wyt had byn so good when as you paste me bye, To haue declared what I was and eke my myserie: I had not felte the halfe of this whych now I dyd sustayne, But syth the thynge is paste of it to talke it is but vayne. My freind Archelaus Alfagus sayde to god gyue prayse alwaye, Who hath you helped in your cares vnto this present daye: And looke what thynge there lyeth in mee demaunde and you shall haue, My lyfe and goods I will not spare you my freinde for to saue. If that you wyll abyde in Roome and dwell here styll with mee, My house, my goods, my landes and all euen as your owne shall bee: In felowwyp we will remayne as longe we wonted were, To ryde and go both daye and nyght for you I will not spare. My louyng freind Archelaus sayde I thanke you hartelye, For this your kyndnes to me shewed of my parte vnworthye: But I intende to go agayne my countrey to beholde, If of your helpe and ayde therin to craue I myght be bolde. All that is myne Alfagus sayde as I haue tolde before, Ye may c?maunde now at this tyme and shall do euer more: And sith it is your mynde to go into your owne countree, You shall haue all the ayde and helpe that can be made by mee. In haste I will prouyde therfore an Armye fearce and stoute, Whom I to Carthage wyll conducte to hunte those rebells oute: Not one of them there shall escape vnponyshed for the thynge, So that all Carthage rounde aboute of theyr desarte shall rynge. The Senate by aucthorytie then theyr Romayne Hoste dyd call, And twenty thousand men in raye they set both stronge and tall, Whych were on horsebacke poynted well for to resyste their foo, And eke as many foote men stood in redynes to goo. Alfagus tooke his leaue then of Andromyca his Ladye, And Archelaus he dyd conducte strayght vnto Carthagye: Where as by force of powre he slewe and ponyshed those that he, Myght here or learne by any meane Archelaus foes to be. And those also which dyd dysdayne to helpe him in his neede, Alfagus ponyshed sundry wyse accordynge to theyr meede: And set hys freind Archelaus cheefe. in dygnytye to raygne, Aboue those which in Carthagye the Citie dyd mayntayne. Restorynge to hym all the lande and goods he had before, Agmented by the death of them which hated hym before: Now when Alfagus had done thys and set in quyet peace, Hys deere freinde Archelaus whom wyth goods he did increase. He made the Senatours all to sweare obedyence for to gyue, To his freynde Archelaus whylste he theare on earth dyd lyue: And no man for to be so boulde hys counsell to dyspyse, But take hym as he is, a man both noble sage and wyse. Thys done and all thynge set at reste the beste waye that myght bee, He sayde freynd Archelaus nowe come take your leaue of mee: For I must needes to Roome agayne myne armye to conuaye, And you I shall not see no more agayne thys many a daye. O freind Alfagus Archelaus sayde great kyndnes you haue showed, On mee, and I may thynke my loue on you right well bestowed: I gyue you harty thankes therfore no better mendes I make, But looke what lyeth in me to do I am redye for your sake. Sease of those wordes Alfagus sayde my louynge freinde moste dere, And better then your selfe let mee not to your eyes appeare: For thankynge mee in thys my payne now taken for your sake, Is nothyng but as vnto you a symylytude I shall make. Which is euen as though my left hande my ryght hand thankes shoulde gyue, For sekyng helpe when it was hurte the wounde for to relyue. Wee are as one you knowe ryght well and euer more will bee, And looke what anye man doth for you he doth it eke for me. For if one member the bodye to ayde doth seeke with all indeuer, To finde some redye for to heale and cure hys payne for euer: Doth he ought but his duty then euen so my freynde haue I, And still do whyle my life doth last though for you I shulde dye. In deede quoth Archelaus then of ryght it shoulde be so, And syth it is your mynde so soone to Roome wardes ye will go: The gods conduct you on your waye accordynge to your mynde, And sende you quyet passage that no daunger you may fynde. Commend me to your Ladye fayre and thus I take my leaue, With that he caste his armes abrode hys freinde for to receaue: He kyssed him sweetlye then and sayde farewell my hartes delyght, Farewell my louyng frende on whom I thynke both daye and nyght. Alfagus kyssed hym also with the lyke salutacyon, And saide the hoste is redy, I haue no longer delyberacion: But must nedes now departe from you the Gods ye helpe and guyde And ther with all amongst the route vppon hys horse dyd ryde. Who in short space to Rome was brought with great magnyfycye, And was receyued ioyously of Andromyca his Lady. Finis. ?. E. Ienynges.</field>
