      <field name="fulltext">THE ANTAGONISTS I Caverns mouthed with blackness more than night, Fever-jungle deep in strangling brier, Venom-breeding slime that loathest light, Who has plumbed your secret? who the blind desire Hissing from the viper's lifted jaws, Maddening the beast with scent of prey Tracked through savage glooms on robber paws Till the slaughter gluts him red and reeking? Nay, Man, this breathing mystery, this intense Body beautiful with thinking eyes, Master of a spirit outsoaring sense, Spirit of tears and laughter, who has measured all the skies,â Is he also the lair Of a lust, of a sting That hides from the air Yet is lurking to spring From the nescient core Of his fibre, alert At the trumpet of war And hungry to hurt, When he hears from abysses of time Aboriginal mutters, replying To something he knew not within him, And the Demon of Earth crying: âI am the will of the Fire That bursts into boundless fury; I am my own implacable desire. âI am the will of the Sea That shoulders the ships and breaks them; There is none other but me.â Heavy forests bred them, The race that dreamed. In the bones of savage earth Their dreams had birth: Darkness fed them. And the full brain grossly teemed With thoughts compressed, with rages Obstinate, stark, obscureâ Thirsts no time assuages, But centuries immure. As the sap of trees, behind Crumpled bark of bossy boles, Presses up its juices blind, Buried within their souls The dream insatiate still Nursed its fierceness old And violent will, Haunted with twilight where the Gods drink full Ere they renew their revelry of slaying, And warriors leap like the lion on the bull, And harsh horns in the northern mist are braying. Tenebrous in them lay the dream Like a fire that under ashes Smoulders heavy-heaped and dim Yet with spurted stealthy flashes Sends a goblin shadow floating Crooked on the raftersâthen Sudden from its den Springs in splendour. So should burst Destiny from dream, from thirst Rapture gloating On a vision of earth afar Stretched for a prize and a prey; And the secular might of the Gods re-risen Savage and glorious, waiting its day, Should shatter its ancient prison And leap like the panther to slay, Magnificent! Storm, then, and thunder The haughty to crush with the tame, For the world is the strong man's plunder Whose coming is swifter than flame; And the nations unready, decayed, Unworthy of fate or afraid, Shall be stricken and torn asunder Or yield in shame. The Dream is fulfilled. Is it this that you willed, O patient ones? For this that you gave Young to the grave Your valiant sons? For this that you wore Brave faces, and bore The burden heart-breakingâ Sublimely deceived, You that bled and believedâ For the Dream? or the Waking? II No drum-beat, pulsing challenge and desire, Sounded, no jubilant boast nor fierce alarm Cried throbbing from enfevered throats afire For glory, when from vineyard, forge, and farm, From wharf and warehouse, foundry, shop, and school, From the unreaped cornfield and the office-stool France called her sons; but loth, but grave, But silent, with their purpose proud and hard Within them, as of men that go to guard More than life, yet to dare More than death: France, it was their France to save! Nor now the fiery legend of old fames And that imperial Eagle whose wide wings Hovered from Vistula to FinistÃ¨re, Who plucked the crown from Kings, Filled her; but France was arming in her mind: The world unborn and helpless, not the past Victorious with banners, called her on; And she assembled not her sons alone From city and hamlet, coast and heath and hill, But deep within her bosom, deeper still Than any fear could search, than any hope could blind, Beyond all clamours of her recent day, Hot smouldering of the faction and the fray, She summoned her own soul. In the hour of night, In the hush that felt the armed tread of her foes, Like a star, silent out of seas, it rose. Most human France! In those clear eyes of light Was vision of the issue, and all the cost To the last drop of generous blood, the last Tears of the orphan and the widow; and yet She shrank not from the terror of the debt, Seeing what else were with the cause undone, The very skies barred with an iron threat, The very mind of freedom lost Beneath that shadow bulked across the sun. Therefore did she abstain From all that had renowned her, all that won The world's delight: thought-stilled With deep reality to the heart she burned, And took upon her all the load of pain Foreknown; and her sons turned From wife's and children's kiss Simply, and steady-willed With quiet eyes, with courage keen and clear, Faced Eastward.âIf an English voice she hear, That has no speech worthy of her, let this Be of that day remembered, with what pride Our ancient island thrilled to the oceans wide, And our hearts leapt to know that England then, Equal in faith of free and loyal men, Stept to her side. THE HARVEST Red reapers under these sad August skies, Proud War-Lords, careless of ten thousand dead, Who leave earth's kindly crops unharvested As you have left the kindness of the wise For brutal menace and for clumsy lies, The spawn of insolence by bragging fed, With power and fraud in faith's and honour's stead, Accounting these but good stupidities; You reap a heavier harvest than you know. Disnaturing a nation, you have thieved Her name, her patient genius, while you thought To fool the world and master it. You sought Reality. It comes in hate and woe. In the end you also shall not be deceived. THE CAUSE Out of these throes that search and sear What is it so deep arises in us Above the shaken thoughts of fear,â Whatever thread the Fates may spin us,â Above the horror that would drown And tempest that would strike us down? It is to stand in cleansing light, The cloud of dullard habit lifted, To use a certainty of sight And breathe an air by peril sifted, The things that once we deemed of price Consumed in smoke of sacrifice. It is to feel the world we knew Changed to a wonder past our knowing; The grass, the trees, the skiey blue, The very stones are inly glowing With something infinite behind These shadows, ardently divined. We went our ways; each bosom bore Its spark of separate desire; But each now kindles to the core With faith from this transfusing fire, Whereto our inmost longings run To be made infinitely one With that which nothing can destroy, Which lives when all is crushed and taken, The home of dearer than our joy, By all save by the soul forsaken,â The soul that strips her clean of care Because she breathes her native air, Yet not in scorn of lovely earth And human sweetness born of living, For these are grown of dearer worth, A gift more precious in the giving, Since through this raiment's hues and lines The glory of the spirit shines. Faces of radiant youth, that go Like rivers singing to the sea! You count no careful cost; you know; Of that far secret you are free; And life in you its splendour spending Sings the stars' song that has no ending. LOUVAIN To Dom Bruno DestrÃ©e, O.S.B. I It was the very heart of Peace that thrilled In the deep minster-bell's wide-throbbing sound When over old roofs evening seemed to build Security this world has never found. Your cloister looked from CÃ¦sar's rampart, high O'er the fair city: clustered orchard-trees Married their murmur with the dreaming sky. It was the house of lore and living peace. And there we talked of youth's delightful years In Italy, in England. Now, O Friend, I know not if I speak to living ears Or if upon you too is come the end. Peace is on Louvain; dead peace of spilt blood Upon the mounded ashes where she stood. II But from that blood, those ashes there arose Not hoped-for terror cowering as it ran, But divine anger flaming upon those Defamers of the very name of man, Abortions of their blind hyena-creed, Who for âprotectionâ of their battle-host Against the unarmed of them they had made to bleed, Whose hearts they had tortured to the utter-most Without a cause, past pardon, fired and tore The towers of fame and beauty, while they shot And butchered the defenceless in the door. But History shall hang them high, to rot Unburied, in the face of times unborn, Mankind's abomination and last scorn. TO GOETHE Goethe, who saw and who foretold A world revealed New-springing from its ashes old On Valmy field, When Prussia's sullen hosts retired Before the advance Of ragged, starved, but freedom-fired Soldiers of France; If still those clear, Olympian eyes Through smoke and rage Your ancient Europe scrutinize, What think you, Sage? Are these the armies of the Light That seek to drown The light of lands where freedom's fight Has won renown? Will they blot also out your name Because you praise All works of men that shrine the flame Of beauty's ways, Wherever men have proved them great, Nor, drunk with pride, Saw but a single swollen State And naught beside, Nor dreamed of drilling Europe's mind With threat and blow The way professors have designed Genius should go? Or shall a people rise at length And see, and shake The fetters from its giant strength, And grandly break This pedantry of feud and force, To man untrue, Thundering and blundering on its course To death and rue? YPRES On the road to Ypres, on the long road, Marching strong, We'll sing a song of Ypres, of her glory And her wrong. Proud rose her towers in the old time, Long ago. Trees stood on her ramparts, and the water Lay below. Shattered are the towers into potsherdsâ Jumbled stones. Underneath the ashes that were rafters Whiten bones. Blood is in the cellar where the wine was, On the floor. Rats run on the pavement where the wives met At the door. But in Ypres there's an army that is biding, Seen of none. You'd never hear their tramp nor see their shadow In the sun. Thousands of the dead men there are waiting Through the night, Waiting for a bugle in the cold dawn Blown for fight. Listen when the bugle's calling Forward! They'll be found, Dead men, risen in battalions From underground, Charging with us home, and through the foemen Driving fear Swifter than the madness in a madman, As they hear Dead men ring the bells of Ypres For a sign, Hear the bells and fear them in the Hunland Over Rhine! AT RHEIMS Their hearts were burning in their breasts Too hot for curse or cries. They stared upon the towers that burned Before their smarting eyes. There where, since France began to be, Anointed kings knelt down, There where the Maid, the unafraid, Received her vision's crown, The senseless shell with nightmare scream Burst, and fair fragments fell Torn from their centuries of peace As by the rage of hell. What help for wrath, what use for wail? Before a dumb despair All ancient, high, heroic France Seemed burning, bleeding there. Within, the pillars soar to gloom Lit by the glimmering Rose; Spirits of beauty shrined in stone Afar from mortal woes, Hearing not, though their haunted shade Is stricken, and all around With splintering flash and brutal crash The ghostly aisles resound. And there, upon the pavement stretched, The German wounded groan To see the dropping flames of death And feel the shells their own. Too fierce the fire! Helped by their foes They stagger out to air. The green-grey coats are seen, are known Through all the crowded square. Ah, now for vengeance! Deep the groan: A death-knell! Quietly Soldiers unsling their rifles, lift And aim with steady eye. But sudden in the hush between Death and the doomed, there stands Against those levelled guns a priest, Gentle, with outstretched hands. Be not as guilty as they! he cries ... Each lets his weapon fall, As if a vision showed him France And vengeance vain and small. TO THE ENEMY COMPLAINING Be ruthless, then; scorn slaves of scruple; avow The blow, planned with such patience, that you deal So terribly; hack on, and care not how The innocent fall; live out your faith of steel. Then you speak speech that we can comprehend. It cries from the unpitied blood you spill. And so we stand against you, and to the end Flame as one man, the weapon of one will. But when your lips usurp the loyal phrase Of honour, querulously voluble Of âchivalryâ and âkindness,â and you praise What you despise for weakness of the fool, Then the gorge rises. Bleat to dupe the dead! The wolf beneath the sheepskin drips too red. EDITH CAVELL She was binding the wounds of her enemies when they cameâ The lint in her hand unrolled. They battered the door with their rifle-butts, crashed it in: She faced them gentle and bold. They haled her before the judges where they sat In their places, helmet on head. With question and menace the judges assailed her, âYes, I have broken your law,â she said. âI have tended the hurt and hidden the hunted, have done As a sister does to a brother, Because of a law that is greater than that you have made, Because I could do none other. âDeal as you will with me. This is my choice to the end, To live in the life I vowed.â âShe is self-confessed,â they cried, âshe is self-condemned. She shall die, that the rest may be cowed.â In the terrible hour of the dawn, when the veins are cold, They led her forth to the wall. âI have loved my land,â she said, âbut it is not enough: Love requires of me all. âI will empty my heart of the bitterness, hating none.â And sweetness filled her brave With a vision of understanding beyond the hour That knelled to the waiting grave. They bound her eyes, but she stood as if she shone. The rifles it was that shook When the hoarse command rang out. They could not endure That last, that defenceless look. And the officer strode and pistolled her surely, ashamed That men, seasoned in blood, Should quail at a woman, only a woman,âdead As a flower stamped in the mud. And now that the deed was securely done, in the night When none had known her fate, They answered those that had striven for her, day by day: âIt is over, you come too late.â And with many words and sorrowful-phrased excuse Argued their German right To kill, most legally; hard though the duty be, The law must assert its might. Only a woman! yet she had pity on them, The victim offered slain To the gods of fear that they worship. Leave them there, Red hands, to clutch their gain. She bewailed not herself, and we will bewail her not But with tears of pride rejoice That an English soul was found so crystal-clear To be triumphant voice Of the human heart that dares adventure all But live to itself untrue, And beyond all laws sees love as the light in the night, As the star it must answer to. The hurts she healed, the thousands comfortedâthese Make a fragrance of her fame. But because she stept to her star right on through death It is Victory speaks her name. THE DEPORTATION I In vain, in vain, in vain! Conqueror, you are conquered: though you grind These bodies, heel on neck; and though you twist Out of them the exquisite last wrench of pain, They rise, they rise again, Rise quivering and eternally resist All cunning that all cruelty can find To mock the heart and lacerate the mind In vain, in vain! II The train stands packed for exile, truck on truck. Men thronged like oxen, pressed against each other, With worse than anger in their dangerous eyes, Look on their drivers, armed and helmeted,â Then forget all in sudden stormy cries As past the bayonets sister, wife, and mother Strain up to them, clutch fingers tight, are struck And beaten back, but struggle and press again, Catch desolated kisses, fight for breath To sob their widowed hearts out in a word Their man shall hear, reckless of wound or death So they come nigh him; a farewell insane, A passion as if the earth that bore them heard And in her bones groaned! And white children held On shoulders where the torn dress hangs in strips Cry Father! and mute answers wring the lips Of the exiles, in their torture still unquelled. A whistle screams. The guards drive, shout, beat. Then An inspiration like an ecstasy Seizes these women, and they rush to throw Their sobbing bodies prone upon the tracks Before the panting engine. If their men Into that night of slavery must go, They'll be with death before them! Prostrate there, Tear-blinded, with tense arms and heaving backs, Young wife and child and mother of grey hair Clutch the rails, anguished and athirst to die, While over them the towering engine throbs, Blind, ignorant, deaf, and ready. But you spare Such easiness of end, you who did this Which the sun looked on, and which History Shall see for ever. Though they cling with sobs To their own earth, frenzied and bleeding, swift They are harried up; the bayonets prise and lift And tear away their hands' despairing grasp: They are tossed on either side: at the engine's hiss The wheels begin that road which curses pave Between those piteous heaps that cry and gasp Helpless, and cheated even of their grave. III But something lives and burns More perilous to assail Than flesh of bodies frail: It waits and it returns. And when in the night you dream Of the day that you did this thing, When you see those eyes and the bayonets' gleam And the shrieks to your very heart's blood ring As you do your deed in your dream again, The soul of the race that you racked, to do Your Lord's command, that you thought to have cowed, Shall sharpen the bitterness thrice for you As it rises before you, crying aloud: You did it in vain, in vain! ENGLAND'S POET To other voices, other majesties, Removed this while, Peace shall resort again. But he was with us in our darkest pain And stormiest hour: his faith royally dyes The colours of our cause; his voice replies To all our doubt, dear spirit! heart and vein Of England's old adventure! his proud strain Rose from our earth to the sea-breathing skies. Even over chaos and the murdering roar Comes that world-winning music, whose full stops Sounded all man, the bestial and divine; Terrible as thunder, fresh as April drops. He stands, he speaks, the soul-transfigured sign Of all our story, on the English shore. THE SIBYLS Rending the waters of a night unknown The ship with tireless pulses bore me, On the shadowy deck musing late and lone, Over waste ocean. The rustling of the cordage in the dewy wind And the sound of idle surges Falling prolonged and for ever again upthrown Drowsed me; I slept, I dreamed. Out of the seas that streamed In ghostly turbulence moving and glimmering about me I saw the rising of vast and visionary forms. Like clouds, like continents of cloud, they rose, August as the shape of storms In the silence before the thunder, or of mountains Alone in a sky of sunken light: they rose Slowly, with shrouded grandeur Of queenly bosom and shoulder; and afar Their countenances were lifted, although veiled, Although heavy as with thought and with silence, In the heights where dimly gathered Star upon solitary star. And it seemed to me, as I dreamed, That these were the forms of the Sibyls of old, Prophetesses whose eyes were aflame with interior fire, Who passionately prophesied and none comprehended, In the womb of whose thought was quickened the world's desire, Who saw, and because they saw, chastised With voices terribly chanting on the wind The folly of the faithlessness of men. But not as they haunted then In cavernous and wild places, Each inaccessibly sequestered And sought with furtive steps Through wizard leaves of whispering laurel feared, Now to me they appeared. But rather like Queens of fabulous dominion, Like Queens, voices of a voiceless people, Queens of old time, with aweing faces, With burdened brows but with proud eyes, Assembled in solemn parley, to shape Futurity and the nations' glory and doom, They were met in the night together. And lo! beneath them The immeasurable circle of the gloom Phantasmally disclosed In apparition all the coasts of the world, Veined with rivers afar to the frozen mountains. And I saw the shadow of maniac Death Like a reveller there stagger glutted and gloating. I saw murdered cities That raised like a stiffened arm One blackened tower to heaven; I saw Processions of the homeless crawling into the distances; And sullen leagues of interminable battle; And peoples arming afar; the very earth, The very bowels of the earth infected With the rages and the agonies of men. For a moment the vision gleamed, and then was gone. Gloom rushed down like rain. But out of the midst of the darkness My flesh was aware of a sound, The peopled sound of moving millions And the voices of human pain. I lifted my gaze to the Sibyls, The Sibyls of the Continents, where they rose Looking one on another. Ancestral Asia, mother of musing mind, Was there; and over against her Towered in the gates of the West a shape Of youth gigantic, troubled and vigilant; Patient with eager dumbness in dark eyes, Africa rose; and ardent out of the South The youngest of those great sisters; and proud, With fame upon her for mantle, and regal-browed, The stature of Europe old. It seemed they listened to the murmur Of the anguished lands beneath them In sombre reverberation rising and upward rolled. Everywhere battle and arming for battle, Famine and torture, odour of burning and blood, Doubt, hatred, terror, Rage and lamenting! I heard sweet Pity crying between the earth and sky: But who had leisure for her call? or who hearkened to her cry? Not with our vision, and not with our horizon The gaze of the Sibyls was filled. Their trouble was trouble beyond the shaping of our fear, Their hope full-sailed upon oceans beyond our ken; Their thoughts were the thoughts that build Towers for the dawn unseen. But nearer than ever before They drew to each other, sister to shrouded sister, Queen to superb Queen. What counsel took they together? or what word Of power and of parturition Passed their lips? What saw they, Conferring among the stars? My blood tingled, and I heard Syllables, O too vast For capacity of my ears; yet within me, In the innermost bones and caves of my being I felt a voice like the voice of a sea, And the sound of it seemed to be crying: âEndure! Humble yourselves, O dreamers of dreams, In whose bosom is peril fiercer than fire or beast, Humble yourselves, O desolaters of your own dreams, Then arise and remember! Though now you cry in astonishment and anguish âWhat have we done to the beauty of the world That ruins about us in ashes and blood?â Remember the Spirit that moulded and made you In the beauty of the body Shaped as the splendour of speech to thought, The Spirit that wills with one desire, With infinite else unsatisfied desire, Peace not made by conquerors and armies, Peace born in the soul, that asks not shelter or a pillow. The peace of truth, unshaken amid the thunder, Unaffrighted by fury of shrivelling fire, And neither time nor tempest, Neither slumber nor calamity, Neither rending of the flesh nor breaking of the heart, Shall stay you from that desire.â That sound floated like a cloud in heaven, Lingering; and like an answer Came the sound of the rushing of spirits triumphant, Of young men dying for a cause. I lifted my eyes in wonder, And silence filled me. And with the silence I was aware Of a breath moving in the glimmer of the air. The stars had vanished; but again I beheld those Sibyls august Over stilled ocean, And on their faces the dawn. Even as I looked they lifted up their heads, They lifted their heads, like eagles That slowly shake and widen their wondrous wings; They arose and vanished like the stars. The light of the changed world, the world new-born, Brimmed over the silence of the seas; But even in the rising of its beam I remembered the light in their eyes. BEFORE THE DAWN Blacker the night grows ere the dawn be risen, Keener the cost, and fiercer yet the fight. But hark! above the thunder and the terror A trumpet blowing splendid through the night. It is the challenge of our dead undying, Calling, Remember! We have died for you. It is the cry of perilled earth's hereafterâ Sons of our sonsâBe glorious! Be true! Now in the hour when either world is witness, Never or now shall we be proven great, Rise to the height of all our strain and story, Aye, and beyond! For we ourselves are Fate. TO THE END Because the storm has stript us bare Of all things but the thing we are, Because our faith requires us whole, And we are seen to the very soul, Rejoice! From now all meaner fears are fled. Because we have no prize to win Auguster than the truth within, And by consuming of the dross Magnificently lose our loss, Rejoice! We have not vainly borne and bled. Because we chose beyond recall And for dear honour hazard all, And summoned to the last attack Refuse to falter or look back, Rejoice! We die, the Cause is never dead. THE END</field>
