      <field name="fulltext">THE PRAYER âMany worlds have I made,â said the Good God, âBut this is best of all,â He slipped the round earth from His lap, Space held the circling ball. âSix days have I laboured,â said the Good God, âTo make it very fair, And man and woman have I moulded fine, Set them together there. âOpen ye night's windows,â said the Good God, âFor I would hear them pray,â Up from the spinning globe there came Loud cries from far away. âInto my hands deliver,â cried the man, âThe chast'ning of my foe, His vineyards grant meâhis slaves and oxen, So shall I lay him low.â âGive to me strange beauty,â said the young maid, âMore fair than all to be, So I anoint my body and go forth To draw men's hearts to me.â âBehold! this is not good,â said the Lord God, âNor made to My desire,â Then cried His little Son, âI shall go forth, To save them from Thine ire.â âOh, reach ye down your arms,â said the Good God Unto the seraphim, âLift up the broken body of My child For they have tortured Him.â âOpen the windows of the night,â said the Good God, âFor I would hear them weep,â Up from the spinning world's tumultuous sound Man's prayers imperious leap. âInto my hands deliver,â cried the man, âMy foe to bend and break, Burst Thou his strongholds and his ships entomb, So I my vengeance take.â âGive to me rare beauty,â said the young maid, âMore fair than all to be, So I in silken raiment shall go forth To draw men's souls to me.â THE CRY ETERNAL Last eve and through the night I heard a cry Go forth across the fields, and still to-day I hear it echo, and the fierce reply Of some poor stricken heart too far away. Beside my gate a little calf, bereft Of those maternal cares that were his right, Calls for the milky comfort he has left, And learns his first hard lesson through the night. And from afar the answering cries repeat His grief forlorn, his longing, and his woeâ Poor mother mourning, in her green retreat, Her helpless young lost in the vale below. And I had come unto the quiet ways Of pleasant fields, of woods so cool and deep, To lose those cries that from the city's maze Wearied my hours and broke my troubled sleep. To hear this lone and this most stricken call Of all earth's prayers that pierce the eternal height And by the closÃ©d doors of Heaven fallâ What woman's heart can bear it through the night? THE GOOD LORD GAVE The good Lord gave, the Lord has taken from me, Blessed be His name, His holy will be done: The mourners all have gone, all save I, his mother, The little grave lies lonely in the sun. Nay! I would not follow, though they did beseech me, For the angels come now waiting for my dead. Heaven's door is open, so my whispers soar there, While the gentle angels lift him from his bed. O Lord, when Thou gavest he was weak and helpless, Could not rise nor wander from my shielding arm; Lovely is he now and strong with four sweet summers, Laughing, running, tumbling, hard to keep from harm. If some tender mother, whose babe on earth is living, Takes his little hand to guide his stranger feet 'Mid the countless hosts that cross the floor of heaven, Thou wilt not reprove her for Thy pity sweet. If upon her breast she holds his baby beauty, All his golden hair will fall about her hand, Laughing let her fingers pull it into ringletsâ Long and lovely ringlets. She will understand. Wilful are his ways and full of merry mischief; If he prove unruly, lay the blame on me, Never did I chide him for his noise or riot, Smiled upon his folly, glad his joy to see. Each eve shall I come beside his bed so lowly; âHush-a-by, my baby,â softly shall I sing, So, if he be frightened, full of sleep and anger, The song he loved shall reach him and sure comfort bring. Lord, if in my praying, Thou should'st hear me weeping, Ever was I wayward, always full of tears, Take no heed of this grief. Sweet the gift Thou gavest All the cherished treasure of those golden years. Do not, therefore, hold me to Thy will ungrateful; Soon I shall stand upright, smiling, strong, and brave, With a son in heaven the sad earth forgetting, But 'tis lonely yet, Lord, by the little grave, Oh, 'tis lonely, lonely, by the little grave! THE FOUR CHILDREN A Ballad of Good Intentions Four children played by an old oak tree, Big John and James and little Benjie, And, threading a chain of daisies fine, On the leaf-brown sward knelt Geraldine. Quoth John, âI'll ride on the gipsies' road, For narrow space and a small abode Would break this vagrant heart in me, And the world is wide and good to see.â âI'll stay,â said James, âfor my father's sake From his ageing hand his toil to take, So he have at last his heart's desire To sit at ease by the glowing fire.â âI shall not work,â said little Benjie, âNor roam the world that is fair to see; But here I'll stay in the green beech wood, By my mother's side and I'll just be good.â Linking her chain sweet Geraldine said, âBig John or James I will surely wed; I soon must choose which shall best please me, I care not at all for little Benjie.â The oak grows brown and the oak grows green The owl and thrush on her branch have been; For fifty winters a snood of snow She wears all white till the spring winds blow. For fifty autumns a robe of red She wears till the wet west wind has fled, But ne'er from dawn till the dusk of day Hath she heard the sound of a child at play. Big John grows old and all full of care, He works till night in his oaken chair; His feet have led him not long nor late, No more than a league from his father's gate. Where yew trees wave and their dark leaves shed Young James lies cold in his four-foot bed, O soft did his father lay him down, And over him drew the earth so brown In a far-off land on a lonely height Geraldine weeps full many a night, And prays all day 'neath a gallows tree Where hangs the corpse of little Benjie. THE GUARDIAN ANGELS A Ballad Father John in the green lane went And he drew his robe full tight, âI would,â quoth he, âI were home again For there's evil in the night. âI would,â quoth he, âthe gold I bear Were safe with the poor and old, For strange the fear that follows me That my eyes cannot behold.â He looked him left and there he saw A white rose climb and cling, He looked him right and in the brake A wild bird shook his wing. He looked him back and far there stood The old church tall and dim, Yet on the lonely path there came A terror strange to him. Without the shadow of the trees That bent above his way, Where lost the moon her silver light, He stood at last at bay. And on his gown, from his pale brow Fell great tears of his fright; His shaking hands held close the gold Wrapped in its cloth so white. He knelt him down upon his knee And prayed the Lord to hear, âChrist, loosen Thou these laggard feet That hold me slow in fear. âOh, strengthen Thou this childish heart That trembles all afraid, In pity for the calling sick Who die without my aid. âAnd let me bring all safely through The shadows of the night, The gold I bear for old and poor, Still Thou this strange affright.â And as he prayed from off his heart Fear's clutching fingers fell, A holy joy grew in his heart He knew that all was well. He turned him left and stayed to take A white rose from her tree, He turned him right and lilted low A wild bird melody. He looked him back and smiling saw The tall church guarding him, And then all fearless laughing sped Through shadows strange and dim. When but a year had passed away There came before his gate, A dying man who âSuccour,â cried âBefore it be too late.â âOh, shrive me, Father, ere I die,â The moaning stranger said; He took him to his own hearth side And laid him on his bed. âOh, Father! Father! hear me now And let me rest in peace.â âNow speak, my son, and tell your sin To give your soul release.â âIt was one night a year agoâ Sweet Mary, ease my painâ I followed far your toiling feet Within a lonely lane. âThe red gold for the old and poor You had beneath your gown, I hid within a darksome place Where I could strike you down.â Now Father John he smiled and leant In pity by the bed, âI did disarm you by my prayer, I thank the Lord,â he said. âI went in fear upon my path I knew some danger lay, And lone I knelt upon the road A little while to pray.â The dying man he raised his head And laughed both long and loud, âOh, ne'er a prayer would hold my hand Or keep you from your shroud. âBut by you went two mighty men To guard you either side, Else had my dagger reached your heart And surely you had died.â Then Father John upon his knees Bent low his holy head, âGod's angels walked beside me there Lest you my blood should shed: My guardian angels walked by me, I thank Thee, Lord,â he said. THE POISONED ARROW All wounded sore he lay upon my path, His piteous moans his woeful need confessed; I stooped to find his hurt with searching handâ A poisoned arrow pierced his panting breast. He had a friend who dwelt beside the way, And, running swift, I called to him for aid: âYour comrade lies all wounded to his death; Some secret foe a havoc here has made.â Deaf to my call, I saw him crouch and creep, Screened in a laurel's shade, the leaves among He moved to pry and peer and pry againâ Within his hand he held a bow unstrung. A CHILD'S SONG The starlings they have come to town, With polka dots on their robes of brown; They sit a crowd on the old plane tree, And sing this quaint old melody: Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! They come with winter snow and sleetâ Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! Oh, starling, starling, tell me true Of pleasant lands that have sheltered you Of running brook and woodland tree! This is the tale he told to me: Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! Above the hum of busy streetâ Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! The starlings all will fly away, With ice and snow on a sunshine day, Starling, starling, do not go! I miss your pretty singing so: Chirp, chirp, cheep, cheep, tweet, tweet, sweet! 'Tis but the sparrows in the streetâ Chirp, chirp, cheep, cheep, tweet, tweet, sweet! In summer, in a woodland glade, When I shall walk all unafraid, Lured by the blossom and the bee, I'll hear this quaint old melody: Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! And echo call from her retreatâ Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! The starlings they have come from town, With polka dots on their robes of brown: Oh, starling, starling, tell me true, Of city far, now what think you? Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! This fine tale he did repeatâ Creak, creak, pipe, pipe, squeak, squeak, sweet! THE SIX SORROWS There are six sorrows in my heartâ Red Allen, Clare, and Joan, Sweet Bet, and Jock, and little Roy; Six sorrows all my own. Red Allen was my first-born son, How dear he was to see, The first sweet babeâand now he lies Beneath the church-yard tree. My little Clare, and pretty Joan, Sleep, too, in wind and rain, But never do I wake at night To wish them home again. Oh, never do I wake at night To call them home again. I have three sorrows in my breast To drown my heart in tears, My Betty, Jock, and little Roy, To shade my waning years. My sunshine Bet, she made her choiceâ A good man he, and true; And 'neath my fond contented eyes Their pretty courtship grew. When, from the winding road, a foot Stole by my garden gate, And by my door a honey voice Did whisper long and late. And oft a cloth of lavender Young pedlar John would bear, And oft a silken ribbon long To bind my child's soft hair. Oh, bitter was the secret shame He hid beneath his load, My sunshine Bet is far away Upon the gypsies' road. My pretty Bet has strayed away Upon the winding road. I have two sorrows in my heart, To wear me night and dayâ My Jock, and little Roy, who runs Beside my knee at play. My six-foot Jock, in all the town No lad was like to him, What mother's heart could hold my pride Though joy my eyes would dim. Then I could weep but happy tears, They soothe not now my grief, The burning anguish of my heart Has quenched that font's relief. One morn his brow on me did frown, His ready laugh grew still, Full late it was when he came home, In silence from the hill. âWhere have you been, my son so dear, So long, so late!â I cried, âTo seek a little lamb who strayed Upon the bleak hill-side.â âWhat dyes so red, my child, my son, The plaid about your breast?â â'Tis where the wounded lamb did lie, And here its heart-beat pressed.â âThere come four men about the gate, Their looks are stern and cold?â âThey do but seek the little lamb That died beyond the fold.â âThen I shall make the window fast, And I shall bar the door; Oh, fear is bitter at my heart, And I can bear no more.â âYou may not bar the oaken door, Nor make the window fast; But you shall pray for my lost soul, As long as life shall last.â âFor I must go with those who wait About the door with me, Since I have slain my own false love Beneath the linden tree. Oh, I have slain my faithless love, Beneath the linden tree.â I have one sorrow in my heart, My Roy, who sleeps so sound. Oh, will the wide world call this babe, Or holds the grave his shroud? Oh, shall I grieve his golden youth, Or weep him in his shroud? I have six sorrows in my heart, Red Allen, Clare, and Joan, Sweet Bet, and Jock, and little Royâ Six sorrows all my own. A BALLAD OF THE WAILING GHOST As I between the dusk and dark Walked down by Hampton Towers, I strayed upon the haunted path In the forbidden hours. I paced the long and lonesome way In meditation deep, And there I saw a little maid Who bitterly did weep. Quaint was her silken robe and flowed In some disorder down, And on her slender shoulders fell Her locks of tangled brown. âToo late! Too late!â she weeping cried, Her voice was like the windâ She passed and wrung her lily hands And left me far behind. A maid distraught indeed was she Her anguish all confessedâ In the sharp sighing that flew forth From out her heaving breast. When she had gone an echo flew Across the haunted bower; âToo late! Too late!â the whisper came From ev'ry sleeping flower. I met a youth upon the path And bade him tell to me If he had seen the little maid Who wept so dolefully. Upon his cheek the ruddy rose Swift faded into white, âGod pity you, for you have seen The wailing ghost this night. âPray, pray,â he cried, âand shrive your soul, And so avert your fate,â And as he flew me swift in fear A whisper cried âToo late!â An evil prayer rose to my lip âLord! This my soul's relief, To hold her slender hands in mine, And know her secret grief.â LEAVES On the dry brown bough The withered leaves still cling In their last desperate hold And ceaseless murmuring. They push the swinging branch To beat upon the pane; âSave us,â they whispering cryâ âWe shall not live again!â She laughs in pretty play, The child beside my chair, âLook at the linden tree! The leaves are dancing there. âAre swaying on the branch, Are singing in their glee; The little song I hear Is, âI am glad to be.ââ At night when she doth rest From all her laughing hours, And plays in dreamy vales With everlasting flowers. I hear the withered leaves Beat loud upon the pane, âSave us,â they screaming cryâ âWe shall not live again!â What grief within my breast Beats to the tapping call? Deep in my heart I hear The rustling of their fall. SISTER MARIE A Legend of Tyrol I through the valley of Klausen went By a little stream, and heard it sigh, Down by its bed I crouched and bent A listening ear as it hurried by. âLord, have mercy,â it murmured low, âSainted Mother, oh, pray for me!â I laid my hand in the water's flow âSay, little stream, what your troubles be.â âVirgin Mary, for my soul pray, Lord, have pity,â it sighed again, I through the valley did wend my way, Heard it singing the odd refrain. The stream stole by, âO Christ, on me âTake mercy, Lord, a soul afraid.â I looked around and there did see No thing to fearâa peasant maid. âA fair good-day,â she shyly smiled; âA fair good-day to you,â said I, âAnd can you tell me why, sweet child, So loud with prayer the stream goes by.â â'Tis Sister Marie's voice, they say, (God give her soul for ever rest), Who in yon convent walls did pray As Christ's pure bride she dreamt her blest. âBut came at last a bitter day When out of France flew flame and strife, To still the singing birds and lay Shamed flowers in the red stream of life. âAnd ruthless soldiers climbed the hill, Broke through the convent walls and ran Mad through the house to spoil and fill The home that God's pure peace began. âBefore the Saviour's Cross she knelt The fairest nun in all the place, Bowed down until her shoulders felt Rough hands to turn her hidden face. âShe screamed, and up the marble stair Flew like a creature of the wood, And as the hunters on the hare They turnedâthe chase was in their blood. âTheir shouts came to her like the call Of baying hounds upon her track, The turret roof she reachedâthe wallâ No hiding thereâno going back. âLoud came the soldiers, but she prayed No mercy from her fellows there; Death was more kindâshe stood and swayed On the high wall above the glen. âA moment falteredâthen she sprang To the sweet air and God's embrace, And where she fell, the little stream Flowed soft across her dying face. âSo on the wall a cross is made Lest we forget for her to pray, For in God's sight she is afraid Who took her own sweet life away.â She pointed where upon the hill There frowned the old grey convent wall, And there I saw half pictured still, A holy cross rise red and tall. Down on her knees the fair child bent, âAnd pity her, dear Lord,â she criedâ On through the vale the strange stream went, âAh! pity me, dear Lord,â it sighed. THE LAST COACH Before her mirror in a pouting mood, Afraid to weep lest anger should revoke The picture there, she did impatient brood Why Fate should treat her worse than other folk. Her lilac frock her mother's hand caressed, So fond and helpful in maternal pride, Here to its place a slipping button pressed, And there a wayward ribbon softly tied. âThey will not come!â the maid in her despair Cries out on Fate who serves her now so ill: â'Tis past the hour, and oh! they do not care, They have forgot that I am waiting still.â Upon the breeze there comes the sudden beat Of many hoofs and hum of turning wheels, The murmur of low voices in the street, And from afar a church bell faintly peals. âList!â said the maid, â'tis to my neighbour's gate Come these proud horses, hear their harness ring. Perchance her natal feast she holds in state, And ev'ry guest some precious gift will bring. âHark! how they pass, full forty steeds and more, My neighbour's child is but a maid like me; Hear how her friends all whisper by her door, While I forlorn and all neglected be.â âThy humble coach last in the throng may wait, Slow to advance while others hold the way; Perchance but now it passes to our gate, Let me look forth and seek the strange delay.â The mother rose and to the window went, With sore embittered heart that this parade Was not for her dear girl; then slowly bent There for a moment, silent and dismayed. Then came her child, in wonder at her mood, Looked forth and saw, her neighbour's home before, How two black steeds in mournful harness stood To draw their coach of sorrow from the door. âMy neighbour's child is but almaid like thee,â The mother cried, and swiftly heart to heart They clung, and wept together prayerfully, Till each sad coach did from their gaze depart. Then came the last, where merry faces pressed Upon the glass all laughing to be late; And beckoning hands all ready to caressâ This humble coach did stop before their gate. RAIN AFTER DROUGHT All night the small feet of the rain Within the garden ran, And gentle fingers tapped the pane Until the dawn began. The rill-like voices called and sung The slanting roof beside; âThe children of the clouds have come; Awake! awake!â they cried. âWeep no more the drooping rose Nor mourn the thirsting tree, The little children of the storm Have gained their liberty.â All night the small feet of the rain About my garden ran, Their rill-like voices called and cried Until the dawn began. HAUNTED How restless are the dead whose silent feet will stray In to our lone retreat or solitary way; Within the dew-wet wood or sun-enchanted lane We meet them face to face, we hear them speak again. How powerful are the dead whose voices ever speak, So softly by our side in accents faint and weak: They bid us go or stay, or do, or leave undone, We hear them breathe our name ere dawn has well begun. How silent are the dead when come accusing fears To chide our aching hearts, to fill our days with tears: They hush not now our grief, nor heed us as we plead For some unspoken word, or some ungentle deed. Beside the golden fire they take the empty chair They tread from room to room, they pass from stair to stair, And when comes tranquil night to call to us to sleep Within our pleasant dreams the restless dead will creep. How pitiless the dead who come in dearest guise And most belovÃ©d ways before our wistful eyes; To cry to us lost words that we remembered not, To act again each scene that we had half forgot. And should we seek to ease our heart with some caress How timidly they fly and leave us loneliness: How fugitive the dead who at our stricken call Hide in the chilly tomb and answer not at all.</field>
