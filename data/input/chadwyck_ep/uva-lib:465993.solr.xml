INVOCATION I Where Apennine slopes unto Tuscan plain, And breaks into dimples, and laughs to flowers, To see where the terrors of Winter wane, And out of a valley of grape and grain There blossoms a City of domes and towers, II Teuton, Lombard, and grasping Gaul, Prince and Pontiff, have forced their way, Have forded the river, and scaled the wall, And made in its palaces stye and stall, Where spears might glisten and war-steeds neigh. III But ever since Florence was fair and young, And the sun upon turret and belfry shone, Were her windows bannered and joy-bells rung, When back to his saddle the Stranger sprung, And lances were lifted and pikemen gone. IV Yes, ever and ever till you, my Queen, Came over the sea that is all your own, When the tear on the tip of the vine is seen, And the fig-tree cressets have flamed to green, And windflower wakened, and tulip blown. V Then roses were showered before your feet, And her lily-crowned gonfalons waved above, And children chanted in square and street, âAll hail to the Monarch may free men greet, Whose sceptre is Peace, and whose Throne is Love.â VI And now that each snow-torrent foams and falls, And the oreoles sing and the skylarks soar, And the lithe swallow circles her rose-white walls, Through the clefts of the Apennine Florence calls, âMore welcome than Spring, come back once more! VII âCome back, for the cuckoo is on its way, And the mountains, smiling, await your smile; And still in my olive-groves bask and stray, Till the warm-winged waters and winds of May Shall waft you back to your own loved Isle.â I. Cedri, Pian di Ripoli, Florence, Lady-Day, 1898. [âThe sickle hath performed its work] âThe sickle hath performed its work, The storm-gusts sweep the aspens bare, Careering clouds and shadows mirk Cow the disheartened air. âNo swallow circles round the roof, No chirp redeems the dripping shed; The very gables frown reproof, âWhy not already fled?ââ [âShepherd swains that feed your flocks] âShepherd swains that feed your flocks 'Mong the grassy-rooted rocks, While I still see sun and moon, Grant to me this simple boon: As I sit on craggy seat, And your kids and young lambs bleat, Let who on the pierced pipe blows Play the sweetest air he knows. And, when I no more shall hear Grasshopper or chanticleer, Strew green bay and yellow broom On the silence of my tomb; And, still giving as you gave, Milk a she-goat at my grave. For, though life and joy be fled, Dear are love-gifts to the dead.â The Poet has since told me that these lines are a free paraphrase of an idyll by Leonidas of Tarentum, who lived in the time of Pyrrhus. FREE WILL AND FATE I âYou ask me why I envy not The Monarch on his throne. It is that I myself have got A Kingdom of my own: Kingdom by Free Will divine Made inalienably mine, Where over motions blind and brute I live and reign supreme, a Sovereign absolute. II âEbbing and flowing as the seas, And surging but to drown, Think you that I will pass to these My Sceptre and my Crown? Unto rebel passions give Empire and prerogative? They are attendants in my train, To come when I command, and crouch as I ordain. III âIf Will by long succession be Not arbiter of Fate, Assail its majesty, and see If it doth abdicate. Chains that do the body bind Cannot manacle the mind. What fetters may the heart control, Nor doth the Tyrant live that can enslave the soul. IV âIn Spring, when linnets lift their voice To praise the Lord and bless, They are thus punctual of free choice, Detesting waywardness. Throughout earth, and sky, and sea, Law is loving liberty, That could, but will not, go astray, And, free though to rebel, delighteth to obey. V âAnd Spirit, though encased in clay, To sense's grovelling mood Accepteth not, befall what may, Ignoble servitude. In the faggot thrust the torch, Till the flame-tongues search and scorch. Calmly the martyr mounts the pyre, And smiles amid the smoke, and prays above the fire. VI âNor is it Fate directs the waves, Or dominates the wind: They are God's servants, not His slaves, And they surmise His mind. If the planets walk aright Though the dim and trackless night, Nor their true pathway ever miss, Know ye it is because their Will is one with His!â [âWhat is it rules thy singing season?] âWhat is it rules thy singing season? Instinct, that diviner Reason, To which the wish to know seemeth a sort of treason.â âWhy dost thou ever cease to sing? Singing is such sweet comfort, who, If he could sing the whole year through, Would barter it for anything?â [The lark confinÃ¨d in his cage] I The lark confinÃ¨d in his cage, And captive in his wing, Though fluttering with imprisoned rage, Forbeareth not to sing. II But still the strain, though loud and long, Is but the mock of mirth, Not that dawn-dewy nuptial song That weddeth Heaven with Earth. III Voice that in freedom seems so soft, Fettered, sounds harsh and rough. Listen! He shrilleth far too oft, Nor faltereth half enough. IV And I, still feebler it not free, Do hourly more and more Grow silent in captivity, And, if I sing, must soar. V And as the lark's free carol floats High on a sea of sound, So let me fling my random notes To ripple round and round. VI Hark! now he shakes the towering skies, A carillon of light, Then dwindleth to a faint surmise, Still singing out of sight. VII And, though in clearest light arrayed The Poet's song should shine, Sometimes his far-off voice will fade Into the dim divine. VIII Then we with following ear and heart Should listen to the end, Though we descry may but in part, And dimly apprehend. IX Lo! soon he quits his heavenly quest, Slow-carolling into sight, Then, quavering downward, strikes his nest, Earthward aerolite. X So doubt not, dear, that if I soar Where none longwhile may dwell, Though Heaven at times may be my home, Home is my Heaven as well. [What ails you, Ocean, that nor near nor far] The Mountains What ails you, Ocean, that nor near nor far, Find you a bourne to ease your burdened breast, But throughout time inexorable are Never at rest? With foaming mouth and fluttering crest you leap Impatiently towards never-shifting beach, Then wheel, and hurry to some distant deep Beyond your reach. Nor golden sands nor sheltering combes can slake Your fretful longing for some shore unknown, And through your shrineless pilgrimage you make Unending moan. The Sea Nimbused by sunlight or enwreathed in snow, Lonely you stand, and loftily you soar, While I immeasurably ebb and flow From shore to shore. I see the palm-dates mellowing in the sun, I hear the snow-fed torrents bound and brawl, And if, where'er I range, content with none, I know them all. Inward the ice-floes where the walrus whet Their pendent tusks, I sweep and swirl my way, Or dally where 'neath dome and minaret The dolphins play. Beneath or bountiful or bitter sky If I myself can never be at rest, I lullaby the winds until they lie Husht on my breast. The Mountains Till they awake, and from your feeble lap Whirl through the air, and in their rage rejoice: Then you with levin-bolt and thunderclap Mingle your voice. But I their vain insanity survey, And on my silent brow I let them beat. What is there it is worth my while to say To storm or sleet? I hear the thunder rumbling through the rain, I feel the lightning flicker round my head; The blizzards buffet me, but I remain Dumb as the dead! Urged by the goad of stern taskmaster Time, The Seasons come and go, the years roll round. I watch them from my solitude sublime, Uttering no sound. For hate and love I have nor love nor hate; To be alone is not to be forlorn: The only armour against pitiless Fate Is pitying scorn. The Sea Yet do I sometimes seem to hear afar A tumult in your dark ravines as though You weary of your loneliness, and are Wrestling with woe. The Mountains When the white wolves of Winter to their lair Throng, and yet deep and deeper sleeps the snow, I loose the avalanche, to shake and scare The vale below. And, when its sprouting hopes and brimming glee Are bound and buried in a death-white shroud, Then at the thought that I entombed can be, I laugh aloud. The Sea I grieve with grief, at anguish I repine, I dirge the keel the hurricane destroys: For all the sorrows of the world are mine, And all its joys. And when there is no space 'twixt surf and sky, And all the universe seems cloud and wave, It is the immitigable wind, not I, That scoops men's grave. I wonder how the blast can hear them moan For pity, yet keep deaf unto their prayers. I have too many sorrows of my own, Not to feel theirs. And when the season of sweet joy comes round, My bosom to their rapture heaves and swells; And closer still I creep to catch the sound Of wedding bells. I see the children digging in the sand, I hear the sinewy mariners carouse, And lovers in the moonlight, hand-in-hand, Whispering their vows. You in your lofty loneliness disdain Suffering below and comfort from above. The sweetest thing in all the world is pain Consoled by Love. [âThe smiling slopes with olive groves bedecked] âThe smiling slopes with olive groves bedecked, Now darkly green, now, as the breeze did stir, Spectral and white, as though the air were flecked With elfin branches laced with gossamer; And then so faint, the eye could scarce detect Which the gray hillside, which the foliage fair; Until once more it dense and sombre grew, To shift again just as the zephyr blew. [âCovet who will the patronage of Kings] âCovet who will the patronage of Kings, And pompous titles Emperors bestow, Splendour, and revelry, and all that brings A thousand bitter thoughts, a world of woe: A meadow glistening in an April shower, A green-banked rivulet, and, near his nest, A blackbird carolling in guelder bower, 'Tis these that soothe and satisfy the breast.â A BIRTHDAY PRESENT I ââSay what, to please you, you would have me be.â Then listen, dear! I fain would have you very fair to see, And sweet to hear. II âYou should have Aphrodite's form and face, With Dian's tread; And something of Minerva's lofty grace Should crown your head. III âSummer should wander in your voice, and Spring Gleam in your gaze, And pure thoughts ripen in your heart that bring Calm Autumn days. IV âYours should be winning ways that make Love live, And ne'er grow old, With ever something yet more sweet to give, Which you withhold. V âYou should have generous hopes that can beguile Life's doubts and fears, And, ever waiting on your April smile, The gift of tears. VI âYou should be close to us as earth and sea, And yet as far As Heaven itself. In sooth, I'd have you be Just what you are.â AT HER GRAVE I Lo, here among the rest you sleep, As though no difference were 'Twixt them and you, more wide, more deep, Than such as fondness loves to keep Round each lone sepulchre. II Yet they but human, you divine, Warmed by that heavenly breath, Which, when ephemeral lights decline, Like lamp before nocturnal shrine, Still burneth after death. III Yes, here in Tuscan soil you lie, With Tuscan turf above; And, lifting silent spires on high, The cypresses remind the sky Of the city of your love. IV And you did grow so like to her Wherein you dwelt so long, Your thoughts, like her May roses, were Untrained, unchecked, but how astir, And oh how sweet, with song! V The Poet of Olympian mien His frenzy doth control, And, gazing on the dread Unseen, Keep mind majestic, will serene, And adamantine soul. VI He, save to Wisdom sternly true, Is but the sport of Fate And gladiatorial pain. But you! A poet, and a woman too! The burden was too great. VII And so you laid it down, and here, Oblivious of life's load, Quiet you sleep through all the year, Young Spring, staid Summer, Autumn sere, And Winter's icy goad. VIII The swallows, freshly on the wing, In April's sun rejoice; The nightingales unceasing sing; Yes, Spring brings back the birds of Spring, But not, alas! your voice. IX So round your sleep I soft let fall Frail emblems of regret; The lowly wind-flower, tulip tall, The iris mantling wayside wall, And weeping violet. X My votive flowers to-day will blow, To-morrow be decayed; But, though long sunk from sight, I know, The glory of your afterglow Will never wholly fade. [âRoses crimson, roses white] âRoses crimson, roses white, Deadly pale or lovely blushing, Both in love with May at sight, And their maiden blood is rushing To and fro in hope to hide Tumult it but thus discloses. Bring the Bridegroom to the Bride! Everywhere are roses, roses.â [âEvery wall is white with roses] âEvery wall is white with roses, Linnets pair in every tree; Brim your beakers, twine your posies, Kiss and quaff ere Springtime closes; Bloom and beauty quickly flee.â [âNay, let me sleep, or, best, be stone or steel] âNay, let me sleep, or, best, be stone or steel, While still endures this infamy of woe. My one sole bliss is nor to see nor feel: So, wake me not; and, lest you should, speak low.â [âKnow, Nature, like the cuckoo, laughs at law] âKnow, Nature, like the cuckoo, laughs at law, Placing her eggs in whatso nest she will; And when, at callow-time, you think to find The sparrow's stationary chirp, lo! bursts Voyaging voice to glorify the Spring.â WHEN I AM GONE When I am gone, I pray you shed No tears upon the grassy bed Where that which you have loved is laid Under the wind-warped yew-tree's shade. And let no sombre pomp prepare My unreturning journey there, Nor wailing words nor dirges deep Disturb the quiet of my sleep; But tender maidens, robed in white, Who have not yet forgotten quite The love I sought, the love I gave, Be the sole mourners round my grave. And neither then, nor after, raise The bust of pride, the slab of praise, To him who, having sinned and striven, Now only asks to be forgiven, That he is gone. When I am gone, you must not deem That I am severed, as I seem, From all that still enchains you here, Throughout the long revolving year. When, as to Winter's barren shore The tides of Spring return once more, And, wakened by their flashing showers, The woodland foams afresh with flowers, You sally forth and ramble wide, I shall walk silent at your side, Shall watch your mirth, shall catch your smile, Shall wander with you all the while, And, as in many a bygone Spring, Hear cuckoo call and ousel sing. And, when you homeward wend, along A land all blithe with bleat and song, Where lambs that skip and larks that soar Make this old world seem young once more, And with the wildwood flowers that fill Your April laps deck shelf and sill, I shall be there to guide your hand, And you will surely understand I am not gone. When Summer leans on Autumn's arm, And warm round grange and red-roofed farm Is piled the wain and thatched the stack, And swallows troop and fieldfares pack; When round rough trunk and knotted root Lies thick the freshly-fallen fruit, And 'mong the orchard aisles you muse On what we gain, on what we lose, Now vernal cares no more annoy, And wisdom takes the place of joy, I shall be there, as in past years, To share your steps, to dry your tears, To note how Autumn days have brought Feelings mature and mellow thought, The fruitful grief for others' smart, The ripeness of a human heart. And, when the winds wax rude and loud, And Winter weaves the stark year's shroud, As round the flickering household blaze You sit and talk of vanished days, Of parent, friend, no longer nigh, And loves that in the churchyard lie, And lips grow weak, and lids grow wet, Then, then, I shall be with you yet, Though I seem gone. [âFather, farewell! Be not distressed] âFather, farewell! Be not distressed, And take my vow, ere I depart, To found a Convent in my breast, And keep a cloister in my heart.â GOOD-NIGHT! I Good-night! Now dwindle wan and low The embers of the afterglow, And slowly over leaf and lawn Is twilight's dewy curtain drawn. The slouching vixen leaves her lair, And, prowling, sniffs the tell-tale air. The frogs croak louder in the dyke, And all the trees seem dark alike: The bee is drowsing in the comb, The sharded beetle hath gone home: Good-night! II Good-night! The hawk is in his nest, And the last rook hath dropped to rest. There is no hum, no chirp, no bleat, No rustle in the meadow-sweet. The woodbine, somewhere out of sight, Sweetens the loneliness of night. The Sister Stars, that once were seven, Mourn for their missing mate in Heaven. The poppy's fair frail petals close, The lily yet more languid grows, And dewy-dreamy droops the rose: Good-night! III Good-night! Caressing and caressed, The moist babe warms its mother's breast. Silent are rustic loom and lathe; The scythe lies quiet as the swathe; The woodreeve blinks in covert shed, The weary yokel is abed, The covey warm beneath the wing, And sleep enfoldeth everything. Forsaken love, its last tear shed, On the lone pillow lays its head, And all our woes are respited: Good-night!</field>
