      <field name="fulltext">VLYSSES AND CALYPSO Night held her middle course, The Bear had turned the Pole: The Pleiads to their source Beneath the Ocean stole. There swept along the wave Fair sound and odorous light, From where in secret cave Calypso watched the night. And still with hands and feet A golden thread she wove, While in sad strain and sweet She sang her absent love. âVlysses, thou art gone, Thou sailest on the sea: Colder thy heart than stone, Heavy is mine in me. âThou camest through the gate Of the wide open main, Whose valves of mist so late Have closed thee hence again. âThat night the great winds blew, Though high the sky and bare: The smitten billows flew Like monsters half in air. âI saw beneath the moon The breaking waters shock: The sheeted white lay strewn About the battling rock. âBut whiter than the spray The cloudless moon shone o'er A naked man there lay Vpon the ghostly shore. âSenseless he lay for dead: The heavy swinging wave Flew out beyond his head, And clothed him with his grave. âI took him from the brine, I bore him to my cell: Fed him with bread and wine, And wreathed my gentlest spell. âI called the dreams from heaven To hover round his bed; Bade each appointed sweven Nurture and solace shed. âI sang within his sight, Sitting within the grot: Sang from the far far hight, Where he beheld me not. âI promised him to shew The sights the gods hold dear: That all of weal and woe To him might changed appear: âThat more than gold to him The gleam of gold might be: Or grass, that wild winds skim, Than corn-choked granary: âThat joy's quick smile might mock Joy's joy: that strength might rob Pain of her scaith, and rock Heart with exultant throb: âThat so, the world around, Might death seem fair and gay: Jocund the tiger's bound, Merry his bleeding prey. âEcho and Iris both From cloud and cavern came, The wandering air to clothe With laughter and quick flame. âEcho made earth to ring With voices of delight; And Iris spread her wing Sevenfold of colours bright. âEcho laughed through the land, Iris came o'er the sea; Her grey-winged dove in hand Amid the clouds smiled she. âI sang with tingling strings, And set within his range, How bright the life of things Lifted o'er mortal change. âHow rich the taste of bliss The reckless gods enjoy, Because the cup they kiss, Not drain it to annoy. âHow he with me might gain, Through high resolved power Loosing the mortal chain Scaithless, the airbuilt tower. âAlas! the man I loved, The man I sang so fair, Along the shore still moved With downcast eyes of care. âMortals with mortals mate: This law, since Zeus began From gentler Saturn's date, Divides the gods from man. âAcross the sea he sent A long and wistful gaze: And sighs of discontent His stormy breast would raise. âAh, then I changed my song: Woe's me! to weave delay I did the gods this wrong Their secret to betray. âI told that in the hight The gods, no more than man On earth, do hold delight In caption, neither can: âThat in the doublest knot Of cloud, or fold of foam, Or light that flies the grot, Some nymph's extremest home, âWhat glinted seems to be Fairest to mortal eyes, E'en of the eyes that see Partakes the maladies: âThat Zeus himself makes quest For ever, winning nought; And, if there be a best, 'Tis still for ever sought; âThat things the most unknown, In silence as in sound: That things the rarest shewn, O'erpassing mortal bound: âLike things to man that fall, And his full knowledge own; They have one lot in all, But happiness is none: That gods but gaze and guess, Marvelling that they create; Not theirs, beneath fate's stress, To enjoy, but contemplate: âThat what gods hide is pain, Though men believe it bliss.â This said I: and in vain, Nor made my sorrow his. âVlysses, thou art gone: Thou sailest on the sea: Colder thy heart than stone, As heavy mine in me. âA stone? That is thy heart: That stone may we divide: The heaviness my part; The coldness, that I chide. âBut if with heaviness Coldness doth make a stone, This without that is less.â Stone-heart, thou heart hast none! âFor, as the time went on, He wept with many a tear, Still grieving to be gone: I could not hold him here. âMy wood, that waved so fair, To make his raft I felled: For sails I did not spare My woven stuffs to yield. âAnd, though so late he sighed, Now, as he shaped his raft, He smiled, all eager-eyed, And talked of sailor craft. âHis arms were rough with scars, With toil his sinews wight; He spake of works and wars, As I spake of delight. âHe spake of mortal love Made more by mortal care, When each with other strove The heavier load to bear: âOf children known more dear By helpless infancy: Of virtue proved to cheer, When gods send misery. âVlysses, thou art gone, Thou sailest on the sea: I sought thee for mine own, But thou hast conquered me. âFor now I feel within Both human thought and care: Now cold is grown, and thin And wonderless the air. âAnd now I long to fix In some poor cot my rest: With mortal care to mix, And nurse perturbed breast: âAnd gradually to grow Older, more weak and blind, Till Death should bid me go To join my buried kind. âNow all the gods above Behold me with disdain, Where in their clouds they move Still pitiless of pain. âFor when my hand was lent To aid thy building craft, From out the clouds they bent, And at my labour laughed. âAnd when from off the shore Thy finished skiff was cast, Their laughter rose the more Along the glittering vast. âOver the sea went'st thou, Never regarding me: Ah, would that I were now But thy Penelope.â MERCVRY TO PROMETHEVS Like a star I fly, Till the storm I near Of the agony Which from far I hear. Where the eagle screams On the frozen air, Where like ghostly dreams Stand the mountains bare: Their tempestuous throng Darkly set to drive, With the northwinds strong Where the stormclouds strive, While they closer fold That gigantic form, Bathed in rain of cold, Sunk in shock of storm. Titan, look on me: Like a star I fly: Thou too mightest be Such a god as I. THE MYSTERY OF THE BODY Smiling with a pliant grace Rose on me a learned face: Smiled the soul when smiled the eyes?â Vp when ran the traceries Of the forehead arching high, Did the inner faculty Tempering the hidden nerve Mould the momentary curve, Waking motions strange between Spirit fine and fleshly screen? May I then a likeness find In the features of the mind And the antic of the flesh? Wherefore should the wrinkled mesh Of the forehead arching high Image the soul's pleasantry? LIFE AND DEATH Lifeâ I am the daughter of Time, And twin to my brother Death: Where I am, there is he. Space to the star, to the earth her clime, I make by my breath: To the heart its beat. The world's circumference I take for my seat: Nor less man's pageantry, His ring of sense. Round the one on guard The stars keep burning ward: The other is made sure By phantoms I conjure. Vermillion, saffron, white, Weave ever my delight, Lest Death should disenchant Those whom I fain would haunt. Deathâ I am the brother of Life: Of old she named me Strife. In sorrow and in tears I ruin what she rears. She is a sorceress Of might, of skill not less: Who by her magic power Gathers from hour to hour Grains from the infinite: And in them skills to write The knowledge that they are. Then pain and pleasure war Within them, till I come And redissolve her sum. Forth from her painted hall Her slaves I disenthrall: But when I come to break The subtle bond, they shriek. ODE: THE SPIRIT WOOED Art thou gone so far, Beyond the poplar tops, beyond the sunset-bar, Beyond the purple cloud that swells on high In the tender fields of sky? Leanest thou thy head On sunset's golden breadth? is thy wide hair spread To his solemn kisses? Yet grow thou not pale As he pales and dies: nor more my eyes avail To search his cloud-drawn bed. O come thou again! Be seen on the falling slope: let thy footsteps pass Where the river cuts with his blue scythe the grass: Be heard in the voice that across the river comes From the distant wood, even when the stilly rain Is made to cease by light winds: come again, As out of yon grey glooms, When the cloud grows luminous and shiftily riven, Forth comes the moon, the sweet surprise of heaven: And her footfall light Drops on the multiplied wave: her face is seen In evening's pallor green: And she waxes bright With the death of the tinted air: yea, brighter grows In sunset's gradual close. To earth from heaven comes she, So come thou to me. Oh, lay thou thy head On sunset's breadth of gold, thy hair bespread In his solemn kisses: but grow thou not pale As he pales and dies, lest eye no more avail To search thy cloud-drawn bed. Can the weeping eye Always feel light through mists that never dry? Can empty arms alone for ever fill Enough the breast? Can echo answer still, When the voice has ceased to cry? NATVRE AND MAN Blve in the mists all day The hills slept far away, Skiddaw, Blencathra, all: But now that eve gins fall, They all seem drawing near In giant shapes of fear: While o'er the winding walks The mighty darkness stalks, Quenching the rich gorse-gold On purple-deepened wold, The columned pines their plumes More blackly wave: then comes The night, the rising wind. Oh Nature, art thou kind From fair to fair to range In never ceasing change Beyond our power to feel? For still dost thou unseal Thy glories numberless In changeful recklessness, But givest us no power To take the varied hour. O'erweighed by all, we lose Thy glories, or confuse. E'en now this changeful sight Of slow-advancing night, The sleeping fields, the sweep Of redness on the steep, And o'er the hills and meads The darkness which succeeds, E'en now this change is lost, Or by dull urgents crossed. So, on the smooth sea-sand Spread by the ebb's last hand, And warmed by sunset's fire, Walking to me desire Has come to bear away Each precious grain that lay, Ere the cold wave again Should mix and drown the plain: So have I felt desire Insatiably expire. To mock us thus with change, From fair to fair to range, Dissolving thy most fair Into a change as rare, Leaving our hearts behind, Oh, Nature, art thou kind? Thou walkest by our side, Looking with eyes full wide With laughter at our woe, Because we would keep so What is most fair to us.â That bud how tremulous, Which hangeth on the bough! Ah, wouldst thou but allow That it should hang there still! Not so; with wanton will Thou clappest to thy hands, And the burst bud expands Into a flower as sweet. With laughter thou dost greet The human sigh and groan That mourns the thing that's gone. Thou laughest, for thy store Holds beauty evermore: Nor loss to thee the pain Of our heart-dizzied brain. Then thou thyself dost tire Of the unfilled desire With which we thee pursue: Therefore, with sudden view Thou shewest us a glass To see ourselvesâAlas, Grey we are grown, and old: Our fancied heat is cold, Our shaking limbs are dry: We see ourselves, and die. THE STORM DEMON The rock was black, the cloud was white: The black rock in a gorge was set. Earth rose, heaven stooped: upon that hight The thunder with the torrent met. The vast half-weeping cloud came down, Storm-laden: and a demon form, Of gathered wrath, stood with a frown Vpon that pedestal of storm. He stood, his rolling mantle spread, His hat of darkness deeply set: His locks heaved cloudlike round his head; The torrent lashed his feet of jet. Forth from his eyes the lightning leapt, His voice spake with the thunder's tone: Earth's waters in swift flashes swept, Her caverns answered with a groan. A COVNTRY PLACE REVISITED My foot returns: the same wild tree Waves in the hedgerow over me. I knew not then, I know not now The leaves that hang upon her bough. But I recal her wind-vexed form Tossed in a sort of mimic storm, And threatening all those leaves to cast If wilder grew the sportive blast. And how the bold and merry wind Grew silent suddenly, I mind: The wind, that summer's sweets had made More bold to dare the silvan maid. The summer breeze still plays as free, And shakes the ringlets of the tree: But I, who watched them then as now, Turn I to them as calm a brow; Or can I smile to see their play As blithe as on the former day? Thought, that comes first as fantasy, Sadly returns as memory. She looks with question from the eyes Whence first she laughed with glad surprise: And thence descending to the heart Ends with a sigh her former part; Filling the sketch that first she drew With graver touch than then she knew. THE WILD ROSE Go forth, go forth, when leafy June Has pinned on every hedgerow briar The frail wild rose, that heaves in tune With each soft breath that they respire Whose bosoms wear the brave attire. And if the meek grass companies, That shrink to cross man's beaten ways, Smile at the shew with loving eyes, And seem to prank their pride, to praise The fairest comers of their days: And if the nobler forms that lead High nature to the changeful skies, The stately trees, seem to give heed: Do thou too of this joy make prize, To store with thy good memories. BOTH LESS AND MORE I rode my horse to the hostel gate, And the landlord fed it with corn and hay: His eyes were blear, he limped in his gait, His lip hung down, his hair was grey. I entered in the wayside inn; And the landlady met me without a smile; Her dreary dress was old and thin, Her face was full of piteous guile. There they had been for threescore years: There was none to tell them they were great: Not one to tell of our hopes and fears; And not far off was the churchyard gate. THE HAND OF MAN In vivid greens the budded year Spread fresh and fair and bold and gay: Fair waved the grasses far and near, Fair waved the bough with tasselled spray. The mountains rose on either hand, A large and free as piled cloud: Down flowed the undulating land, Down flowed the watercourses loud. But sadness bound my eyes alway, And nothing gave my heart delight, Vntil I saw a wall of clay, O'er which some flowering grass grew bright. 'Twas man's bold hand had built the wall, And trained the grass to level hight, With every wind to rise and fall: At this my heart felt some delight. VAIN AMBITION A thovsand keen eyes peer From out Earth's atmosphere, Following the borrowed beam, Which restlessly she flings Midst the sun-circling rings, The planetary scheme. She wonders at the light Cast through the depths of night, Where Aldeboran burns: Which travels myriad years, Passing unnumbered spheres, To reach her, where she turns. But what knows he of her, He, of her sun the peer, In his tremendous might: Whether her rays may gain The circuit of his reign, Or midway cease in night? She round about her sun From space to space doth run: He, as he was erewhile, Sits on his fixed throne, Shines where he ever shone, As if she moved no mile. So far is he in space, That her mile-million race As emmet's inch is run: Nor may that little range Avail his place to change: He looks upon the sun. Moon, thou hast power to burn Through mists, and clouds to turn To silver-threaded haze: The cedar holds thee now In his cavernous bough, Thee, and thy white-armed fays. Enough it is for thee Earth's comforter to be, To make a holy place, Where naught is seen by day But ravin and decay, Men, and what men deface. VNREST Day is again begun By the unresting sun: Morning o'er all the lands Rises with clasped hands: And in the increasing light Sickens the Moon of night: For darkness leaves her there To linger pale and bare, Till fullest light, more kind, From view her form shall wind. But in this rising morn Muse not on things forlorn, Knowing thyself the thrall Of life beyond them all. Another day shall pass Like yesterday that was; Another night shall come, Like the last perished gloom: And thou shalt never rest, Nor yet attain thy quest: But, like thy very earth, Betwixt dark death, dark birth, Speed, and not know thy speed, While days and nights recede: Thy seeming rest to be Gyres in immensity; The paces of thy strength Small measures of fate's length: Thy waste or use of powers Predestined to their hours: And thou thyself?âThe sob Of pallid lips, the throb Of every heart this day, By which life ebbs away, And yet by which life lives,â Ah, this thy emblem gives. MAN'S COMING The world was gay and blithe: Again the world was sad: Time moved his ceaseless scythe, Time, neither sad nor glad. Then dragon dragon tore; Then swept their sheeted breath: A spasm was at the core, From the rent flesh rose Death. No more than this there wasâ Pain, rage, and Death through pain: No more than this had cause To be in land or main. 'Twas thus before man came: He came, and with him guilt: He bent a brow of shame On blood that had been spilt. He cast an eye of care On pain, on rage through pain: And these were made aware How awful was their reign. And Death, that was at most Carcase and skeleton, Became a shadowy host After the flesh and bone. âWINTER WILL FOLLOWâ The heaving roses of the hedge are stirred By the sweet breath of summer, &amp; the bird Makes from within his jocund voice be heard. The winds that kiss the roses sweep the sea Of uncut grass, whose billows rolling free Half drown the hedges which part lea from lea. But soon shall look the wondering roses down Vpon an empty field cut close and brown, That lifts no more its hight against their own. And in a little while those roses bright, Leaf after leaf, shall flutter from their hight, And on the reaped field lie pink and white. And yet again the bird that sings so high Shall ask the snow for alms with piteous cry, Take fright in his bewildering bower, and die. ODE ON ADVANCING AGE Thov goest more and more To the silent things: thy hair is hoar, Emptier thy weary face: like to the shore Far-ruined, and the desolate billow white, That recedes and leaves it waif-wrinkled, gap-rocked, weak. The shore and the billow white Groan, they cry and rest not: they would speak, And call the eternal Night To cease them for ever, bidding new things issue From her cold tissue: Night, that is ever young, nor knows decay, Though older by eternity than they. Go down upon the shore. The breakers dash, the smitten spray drops to the roar; The spit upsprings, and drops again, Where'er the white waves clash in the main. Their sound is but one: 'tis the cry That has risen from of old to the sky, 'Tis their silence! Go now from the shore Far-ruined: the grey shingly floor To the crashing step answers; the doteril cries, And on dipping wing flies: 'Tis their silence! And thou, oh thou To that wild silence sinkest now. No more remains to thee than the cry of silence, the cry Of the waves, of the shore, of the bird to the sky. Thy bald eyes neath as bald a brow Ask but what Nature gives To the inarticulate cries Of the waves, of the shore, of the bird. Earth in earth thou art being interred: No longer in thee lives The lordly essence which was unlike all, That was thy flower of soul, the imperial Glory that separated thee From all others that might be. Thy dog hath died before. Didst thou not mark him? did he not neglect What roused his rapture once, but still loved thee? Till, weaker grown, was he not fain reject Thy pitying hand, thy meat and drink, For all thou couldst implore? Then, at the last, how mournfully Did not his eyelids sink With wearied sighs? He sought at last that never-moving night Which is the same in darkness as in light, The closing of the eyes. So, Age, thou dealest us To the elements: but no! Resume thy pride, O man, that musest thus. Be to the end what thou hast been before: The ancient joy shall wrap thee stillâthe tide Return upon the shore. TO FANCY I am here for thee, Art thou there for me? Or, traitress to my watchful heart, Dost thou from rock and wave depart, And from the desolate sea? I am here for thee, Art thou there for me? Or, Fancy, with thy wondrous smile Wilt thou no more my eyes beguile Betwixt the clouds and sea? I am here for thee: Art thou there for me? Spirit of brightness, shy and sweet! My eyes thy glimmering robe would meet Above the glimmering sea. My little skill, My passionate will Are here: where art thou? Spirit, bow From darkening cloud thy heavenly brow, Ere sinks the ebbing sea. SONG [In the heart of the thorn is the thrush] In the heart of the thorn is the thrush, On its breast is the flower of the May: On its knees is the head of the rush, At its feet are the buttercups gay. SONG [If thou wast still, O stream] If thou wast still, O stream, Thou would'st be frozen now: And 'neath an icy shield Thy current warm would flow. But wild thou art and rough; And so the bitter breeze, That chafes thy shuddering waves, May never bid thee freeze. SONG [Why fadest thou in death] Why fadest thou in death, Oh yellow waning tree? Gentle is autumn's breath, And green the oak by thee. But with each wind that sighs The leaves from thee take wing; And bare thy branches rise Above their drifted ring. SONG [Throvgh the clearness of heaven to the north] Throvgh the clearness of heaven to the north The sun casts his ceaseless rays: And all day the clouds come forth To float in the azure blaze. They come o'er the long, long hill, That is yellow with corn to see, Whose head wears the merry windmill, Whose foot turns the watermill free. SONG [Oh, what shall lift the night] Oh, what shall lift the night, The lightning or the moon? There is no other light, The day is gone too soon. The lightning with his flash An instant and no more, Is as an angel's lash Smiting the dusk-loved shore. The moon with trembling light From her pale shell of sleep Shall kindlier break the night Of yon thick clouds that weep. SONG [Sky, that rollest ever] Sky, that rollest ever, It is given to thee To roll above the river Rolling to the sea. Truer is thy mirror In the lake or sea; But thou lovest error More than constancy. And the river running Fast into the sea, His wild hurry shunning All thy love and thee; Not a moment staying To return thy smiles, Sees thee still displaying All thy sunny wiles: Till thou fallest weeping: Then more furiously All his wild waves leaping Rush into the sea.
