      <field name="fulltext">ON THE MARRIAGE OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS FREDERICK PRINCE OF WALES: PUBLISHED AMONG THE OXFORD CONGRATULATORY VERSES, 1736. I Fast by the banks of Isis silver-stream'd, In those sweet vales (who knows not those sweet vales?) From whence are kenn'd Oxonia's tow'rs far-fam'd, Whilom I walk'd to catch the noon-tide gales: The murm'ring stream, so gently gliding on, And awful solitude, did thought inspire; Verseless myself I conn'd not blithsom song; No lute had I, nor harp, nor tuneful lyre; Thoughtful, adown I laid me by the stream, That thought brought with it sleep, sleep brought with it a dream. II The scene erst fair to fairer still did yield, Such scenes did never waking eye behold; Nor Enna was so gay, nor Tempe's field, Nor yet Elysium's fabled meads of old. In admiration lost, I raptur'd gaz'd, When, to the sound of dulcet symphonies, A dome, by heav'nly workmanship uprais'd, Forth like a vapour from the earth did rise; No brick nor marble did compose the wall, Transparent 'twas throughout, for it was crystal all. III Forthwith two folding-doors disclosing wide Discover'd to the eye a gorgeous throne, A venerable Pers'nage on each side; Majestic this, that soft and beauteous shone: Upheld by turtles sat this happy Pair, Eternal Peace and loves did sport around; Flutt'ring above did Hymen joyous bear The links in which their mutual hearts were bound, Betok'ning long they'd worn this easy chain, Betok'ning thus they'd long, O! very long remain. IV On either side the throne a glorious band Of Pers'nages were rang'd: in the first place And nearest to the King, did Wisdom stand, And Honour, unacquainted to the Base; Next Justice, never known to err though blind; Vengeance and Clemency on either side; And Pow'r, his eyes on Justice still inclin'd; And Peace, spurning Ambition, Death, and Pride: Well is, I weet, the King who 's thus upheld, Well is the Land whose sceptre such a King doth wield. V Nor did there on the other side, I ween, Forms though more soft, less heav'nly appear; Conjugal Love and Concord still were seen, Becoming Meekness and Submission near; Next Truth, a window in her naked breast, Modesty and Prudence ever judging right, Piety, adding lustre to the rest, And heav'n-born Charity appear'd in sight; Blest is the Maid whose paths these virtues guide, Happy! thrice happy He possess'd of such a Bride! VI While on this venerable Pair I gaz'd Enter'd a band of Youth, joyous and gay, One 'bove the rest most worthy to be prais'd, Who follow'd still where Virtue led the way, Oft-times he tow'rd the waters cast his eye, Which big with Hope and Expectation seem'd, Nor long ere he a vessel did descry, Which fraught with all his wishes tow'rd him stemm'd, An heav'nly Maiden on the deck was plac'd, With ev'ry virtue blest, with ev'ry beauty grac'd. VII White were her robes, which so divinely shin'd As snow and gold together had been wove, Expressive emblem of the purest mind, Expressive emblem of the chastest love; Alternate on the Damsel and the Youth A band of loves pour'd most propitious darts, Which tipt with Pleasure, Constancy, and Truth, Found free admission to their inmost hearts; Swift flew the Youth, with eager haste convey'd, To his own happy shore, the much-lov'd, loving Maid. VIII And now advance in hospitable guise The Royal Pair; with welcome salutation They greet the Maid; joy sparkles in her eyes, Promise of future blessings on the Nation: Nor now did Hymen unemploy'd appear, Their hearts in chains of adamant he bound, Loud shouts of mirth and joy invade the ear, Each echo pleas'd repeats the blithsom sound; I, sleeping as I lay, in rapture cry'd Long live the happy Prince! long live the beauteous Bride! IX In flowing robes and squared caps advance, Pallas their guide, her ever-favour'd band; As they approach they join in mystic dance, Large scrolls of paper waving in their hand; Nearer they come, I heard them sweetly sing, But louder now approach the peals of joy, The gladsome sounds which from each quarter ring, Dispel my slumbers, and my trance destroy, Waking, I heard the shouts on ev'ry side Proclaim Augusta fair the happy Frederick's Bride! MISCELLANEOUS VERSES, WRITTEN AT WHITMINSTER, FROM 1742 to 1750. LEARNING: A DIALOGUE BETWEEN DICK AND NED. (The AUTHOR, and Dr. EDWARD BARNARD, afterwards Provost of Eton.) THE day was sullen, bleak, and wet, When Dick and Ned together met To waste it in a friendly chat, And much they talk'd of this and that; Till many a question wisely stated, And many a knotty point debated, From topic still to topic turning, They fall at length on Books and Learning: Then each with eagerness displays His eloquence, to give them praise. Far in their eulogy they launch, And scan them o'er in ev'ry branch; Thus, th' excellencies making known Of Learning, slyly show their own. Here Dick (who often takes a pride To argue on the weaker side) Cries, Softly, Ned, this talk of learning May hold with men in books discerning; Who boast of what they call a taste, But for all else we run too fast; For lay but prejudice aside, And let the cause be fairly try'd, What is the worth of any thing, But for the happiness 'twill bring? And that, none ever would dispute, Is only found in the pursuit; For if you once run down your game, You frustrate and destroy your aim: He, without doubt, pray mark me, Ned, Has most to read, who least has read; And him we needs must happiest find, Whose greatest pleasure is behind.— Ned, who was now 'twixt sleep and wake, Stirr'd by this argument to speak, Full aptly cry'd, With half an eye Your far-fetcht sophistry I spy; Which, ne'er so subtlely disputed, By two plain words shall be confuted: To give your reasoning due digestion, I first affirm you beg the question. Learning's a game, which, who attains, A great and worthy pleasure gains; Not light and transient like the chace, But stable with unfading grace. There are, indeed, who are so idle, They leave all emprize in the middle; Nor for reflection read or comment, But just to kill the present moment: These hunt romances, tales, and hist'ries, As men pursue a common mistress, Who when once caught but moves their loathing, And well if she 's not worse than nothing; But those of steady, serious life, Know there 's no pleasure like a wife; And such the wise true learning find A lasting help-mate to their mind.— Good sir, quoth Dick, and made a leg, I say 'tis you the question beg. Your similies of wife and mistress Will serve your argument to distress. If knowledge never was attain'd, Which sages always have maintain'd, Then knowledge cannot be a wife; And you yourself conclude the strife. You no less fallacy advance 'Gainst tales, and fables, and romance; For I shall prove t'ye in the sequel, That reading of all kinds is equal; And none can serve a better end, Than cheerfully our time to spend. Nor is't of moment, gay, or serious, But, as the readers minds are various, Each please himself. You contradict Philosophers of every sect, Unless with them you will maintain All human learning to be vain. This, Socrates affirm'd of old, And this our wisest moderns hold. Therefore, if you have prov'd romances, And such like, vain and idle fancies, They've said the same of all the knowledge I'th' sage and philosophic college.— Ned was by this a little nettled: Quoth he, This thing shall soon be settled; With your own arguments disputed, And you with your own weapons routed. You hold the pleasure to consist In the pursuit; this must exist For ever you have eke maintain'd, Asserting knowledge can't be gain'd; By this you fairly overthrow Your first position; for, if so, How can it ever be agreed Who least has read has most to read? If ten miles upwards you could run, Would you be nearer to the sun? Or daily from the sea should drink, Say would you ever find it shrink? Men most delighted are, the fact is, As they more skilful grow by practice; This true in all we have concern in, Much more is found to hold in learning. Who various sciences has read, Has made a store-house of his head; And with him ever bears within A large and plenteous magazine, Whence he's secure to draw at leisure All sorts of precious hoarded treasure: Rich in ideas, ne'er shall he A prey become to poverty; And roaming free, his active mind Can ne'er be fetter'd or confin'd; Nor of dull solitude complain, His thoughts, a cheerful social train: For books of the superior kind With just ideas fill the mind, Nourish its growing youth, confirm Its manhood: prop its age infirm: Learning, our ev'ry step attends, The best of pilots and of friends; Assists our various ills to bear, In fortunes adverse waves to steer; How best in calmer hours to sail, And how improve the prosp'rous gale.— Alas! quoth Dick, mere puff and froth this is, Which you advance for your hypothesis: At best a well-laid theory; No substance or reality; Nor found with practice to agree. Your scheme would be more true and ample, If well supported by example. But these all make against your system, And therefore wisely you supprest 'em; Not all your books can raise the mind Above the weakness of mankind. Zeno, of stoic reading vain, Affirm'd there was no harm in pain. Pyrrho would vaunt (but then he'd lie) Indifference or to live or die. Carneades oft spent his breath T'inspire the bold contempt of death; And once his wisdom did affect So far to ape the stoic sect, He thought he felt an inclination To die, because it was the fashion. Hearing Antipater (a wise one!) Had kill'd himself by drinking poison, He crys, resolv'd to do the same, Give me—but what, forbears to name; Then, baulking his expecting friends, In mere mull'd wine this poison ends. Not all his learning and wise reading, Could Zeno's pupil keep from heeding The rig'rous twinges of the stone, Or but suppress one single groan; Forc'd to own pain at length an evil, And give his doctrine to the devil. Thus these philosophers and leaders Of various sects (profoundest readers) From all their books could ne'er attain, Death to contemn, or smile at pain; And much less reap'd they joy or pleasure, Their volumes yielding no such treasure.— Ned, who now heartily was vext, Began to stickle for his text; Fairly, quoth he, examples cite, We soon shall set this matter right; But those you bring, tho' slyly pickt out, And with all art and cunning trickt out, 'Tis plain to see you falsely vent 'em, And speciously misrepresent 'em. Tho' Dionysius did wince, His master ne'er was known to flinch; His other pupil, Posidonius, Alone would prove your scheme erroneous. When Pompey, who on purpose came So far to hear this sage declaim, Finding him on his sick bed laid, And with severest pains assay'd, Would fain have gone without his errant; The steady stoic would not hear on't; Began, and bravely held it out, Amidst the torments of the gout; Nor could avail th' acutest pang, To stop or discompose th' harangue. Could Epictetus, with such bravery, Or Æsop, bear their painful slavery; Unless by Learning's hand supported, And that relief which Books afforded; Whilst all their votaries have taught That freedom dwells but in the thought. Hence did Philoxenus desire From the rich banquet to retire; Chose rather back to gaol be hurried, Than there with royal dulness worried: His thoughts expatiating free And undisturb'd with poetry; Made bread and water more delicious Than choicest feasts of Dionysius; Proving no pain or thraldom worse is Than slavishly to hear bad verses.— Quoth Dick, 'Tis difficult to know The truth of facts so long ago. Writers enhance their hero's glory, The better to set off their story; And throw a varnish and a gloss over Th' acts of their favourite philosopher. You, of Philoxenus, advance Mere folly, pride, and arrogance; His reading made him no great winner, That lost so foolishly his dinner. Which is the wiser part d'ye think, T'approve, and smile, and eat, and drink; Or sourly criticisms mutter, And quarrel with your bread and butter? But if we find from books arise This squeamish taste, more nice than wise, 'Tis happier sure, and wiser yet, Ne'er to have learnt the alphabet: Yet tho' I scruple not to grant 'Twas Learning made him arrogant, I still must strenuously maintain Indifference to death or pain Proceeds from natural disposition, More than from bookish acquisition. Examples of your suff'ring sages We find not five in fifteen ages. Such volunteers in pain abound, In parts where Books were never found. To prove my words, if 'tis your hap T'have pictures in't, consult your map; There, Ned, a Brahmin may you see Ty'd by the heels to post or tree; From whence he reaches downward to make A fire to roast his breast and stomach; And this he ne'er abates or puts out, Tho' it should burn his very guts out! Yet this from Learning can't proceed, For none of these can write or read. Nor is the next a man of Letters, Who's gall'd by those enormous fetters; Nor yet is he a better Scholar, Who groans beneath that iron collar. Dan Prior's muse a case records, And sweetly too, so take his words: At Tonquin, if a prince should dye, (As Jesuits write, who never lye,) The wife, and counsellor, and priest, Who serv'd him most and lov'd him best, Prepare and light his funeral fire, And cheerful on the pile expire. In Europe 'twould be hard to find, In each degree, one half so kind. But why on European ground Is no such instance to be found? Say, does our learning or our reading Fall so far short of Tonquin breeding? But, as I said before, a case, So far remov'd by time and place, Is seldom faithfully related, Or, in most points, exaggerated. Let us by modern facts be try'd, And not our ears, but eyes decide. Consider but your nearest neighbour, Mark well his ceaseless toil and labour; Or fellow students at the College, Who drudge both night and day for knowledge; Are they for ten years poring better Than if they 'd never known a letter? This thumbs philosophers that teach To be content is to be rich; And finds, he thinks, with greatest rapture, These riches grow with ev'ry chapter; But sound his heart, you'll find it heaving To college rents and future living: This reads the Stoics, and from them Learns all misfortunes to contemn. But a bare nose, or finger's bleeding, Shall countervail his ten years reading. Do not most men more selfish grow, And more reserv'd, the more they know? And when they come to study less, To promote others happiness, They must, 'tis by experience shown, Of consequence impair their own. When Umbrio, fixt upon the skies In absence, turns his musing eyes, And never condescends t' afford, But in a learn'd dispute, a word; Can I persuade myself, that he Is happier than his company? Were it not better for a while To lay his wisdom by, and smile, And join with them to laugh and chat, Altho' he cannot tell at what? Yet he'll indulge these sullen fits, And keep his mirth for brother wits: Then let us follow him to these, And see if he be more at ease. No; soon again his pleasure fails, He frowns, he yawns, he bites his nails; And shews by discontented looks, He wants to leave 'em for his books. Pursue him to his country seat; Is there his happiness complete? With endless volumes fill'd the room, Must needs dispel that sullen gloom: In vain. Ere he an hour has sat, Disliking this, and tir'd with that, Some modern book augments his spleen, Which th' Ancients can't take off again. Impatient from himself to fly, Shall he the field amusements try? No; those a philosophic mind Too barren pleasures needs must find. Then shall he try his hours to spend In chat with neighbouring country friend? Lo! there his joys as vainly plac'd; One knowledge wants, and one a taste, This too reserv'd, that too affected, Envy'd by this, by that suspected: Poor Umbrio meets, at ev'ry turning, Some sad reverse intail'd on learning; And, tir'd o' th' country, back amain Drives to be tir'd of town again. Observe again, th' unletter'd brow No frowns contract, no wrinkles plow; See Bubo's front serenely sleek; Chagrin ne'er wastes Aphronius' cheek; Simplicius with eternal smile; And Dullman ever found tranquil; Prig with self-approbation blest; While nought disturbs Asello's rest.— Quoth Ned, I can no longer bear Such overt falsities to hear; Of arguments there is no end, When with a sophist you contend; Thy proofs all falsely are asserted, Or else most wilfully perverted: In this, as well as other countries, Men drown and hang themselves upon trees; Or, too displeas'd with this to bear it, Leap into t'other world from garret. Yet none in grave discourse, e'er thought Such fit examples to be brought; 'Cause these from madness must proceed, And those from poverty and need. The sages I produced, ne'er sought Their end or pain: their volumes taught Neither to hasten death nor shun it, But with indifference look upon it; Nor ills to court nor yet to fear, Whate'er Fate gave resign'd to bear: From whence I proved beyond dispute, That Learning bears the choicest fruit; And plenteous harvests ever yields To those who duly till her fields. But you deny the truth, averring Her soil not only cold but barren; And the spontaneous idle weed The cultivated crop t'exceed. Now turn we to your happy Clan, And their delights and pleasures scan; See them returning from the field, Their joys are o'er; the fox is kill'd; How shall they pass the tedious night, Till sport return with morning light? From whence procure them recreation, Nor sought from books or conversation? The bottle, lo! their sole resort, Oppressive thought they drown in port; Or, with dear dice or cards beguile, And shield them from themselves awhile. Our gallants now to town repair; What endless pleasures wait 'em there! One half the day in sleep is past, They study how the rest to waste; Till drum or playhouse shall invite To crown with happiness the night. The dress, the valet, and the glass, Help two long irksome hours to pass: The dinner serves them to complain Of taverns, waiters, cooks, champaign. With joy they hear the house is full: The play begins; 'tis grave, 'tis dull. And two more hours their cruel fate Ordains their happiness must wait. Their patience now the drum rewards With whispers, wax-lights, bows, and cards Now, while at whist they take their seat, Go ask them, are their joys complete! Or wait they for some favourite vice; Their girl, their bottle, or their dice? Say, would you for a pattern chuse Dullman, whose passion is the news? Ne'er could the freedom of his mind In prison'd volumes be confin'd; In looser sheets is all his lore, Free as the Sybil's leaves of yore. He ne'er could on one science fix, So fell perforce on politics; In these he can descant as well As any modern Machiavel: Here little progress will enable T' attack the deepest at the table. Great is, I grant you, his delight, When reading a retreat or fight, Or sally or surprise, by the French meant To storm the enemies entrenchment: Or ships engaging with the Spaniard; Or loss of mast by storm, or mainyard; Or cargo sunk, or crew all drownded So Dullman spells it.; Or spurious babe in Wapping found dead. Or how the stubborn Dutch go on slow; Or robb'ry on Blackheath or Hounslow. But should they e'er restrain the press, How great were Dullman's dire distress? And should all Europe be at peace, His pleasure totally must cease. Let us from these now turn our eyes Upon the man that's learn'd and wise: You see him, from his early youth, Taught the pursuits of heav'nly Truth: In ev'ry season, ev'ry place, He follows still the pleasing chace; The nearer to the glorious prize, It shines the brighter in his eyes: And not alone in Books is found, But ev'ry object all around. He not the least of these disdains, Or finds ungrateful to his pains. But like the bee, from ev'ry flower And ev'ry weed, with artful power Collects alone the choicest juice, And lays in store for future use. Thus all things to improvement turning, Still grows his pleasure with his Learning. SOCIETY; ADDRESSED TO HENRY BERKELEY, ESQ. This Poem was intended to delineate the character of Mr. Berkeley, but being unfinished at the time of his death, the Author never could prevail upon himself to complete it. SOCIETY! Our being's noblest end! To thee, with claims unequal, all pretend: From angels or the heav'n-instructed man, To the wild Tartar's unconnected clan: From the vast elephant, or savage bear, To abject reptiles, and those insects spare That wing invisibly the crouded air. Select are thy delights, serene thy joys; How falsely sought in numbers and in noise! Too sober for th' ambitious or the vain; Too delicate for folly's tasteless train. These, while they seek thee in the tents of shame, Bring foul dishonour on thy sacred name; Who think to find thee in the harlot's bow'r, Or loud with Wassel in the midnight hour. Misjudge not then the philosophic mind, Deaf to thy call, to thy endearments blind: Since not thyself the wise, retir'd, disclaim, But that vain phantom which usurps thy name. Is there a man whom conscious worth inspires; Whom wisdom touches with her faintest fires; Whose nicer sense could brook the drunkard's cries, The gamester glorious in his shameful prize; The dull recital of the sportsman hear, Or bigot roar of noisy faction bear? O! should my soul her choicest wish declare, And form to bounteous heav'n her ardent prayer, Nor numerous vassals that obsequious wait In servile crouds, to swell the pomp of state; Nor wealth nor pow'r, nor would she fame require, One perfect Friend should bound her full desire; Learn'd though polite, though noble free from pride, Virtue his guard, and honour be is guide: Not so severely rigid to restrain Mirth's genial friends, and laughter's jocund train; But free to speak with temper or with fire What Pallas dictates, or the Nine inspire; Let no attainment seem too great an height For his aspiring mind's ambitious flight: No useful arts, tho' vulgar or minute, Beneath his pains, unworthy his pursuit. May zeal direct those pains to noblest ends, Zeal for his God, his country, and his friends; Exalted genius animate his soul, And sense, the stable basis of the whole. TOBACCO; A TALE. ADDRESSED TO J. H. BROWNE, ESQ. Author of the “Pipe of Tobacco, in Imitation of six several Authors.” THE folks of old were not so nice But that they'd ask and take advice. 'Twas then the Pythian's prudent voice Directed Tully in his choice. Consult your genius, said the maid; No more; the humble youth obey'd. This rule so short, so just, so plain, Our lively moderns all disdain; And scorn to have their flights controul'd By any Pythians new or old; Nor ask what may their genius fit, But all, forsooth, must aim at wit. When first that fragrant leaf came o'er To bless our barren northern shore, Which your immortal verses raise A rival to the Poet's bays, A squire of Sussex gave command To plant it in his marshy land: His anxious friends and neighbours join To drive him from this strange design.— Tobacco, says a skilful farmer, Requires a dryer clime and warmer; The wat'ry coldness of your soil Will frustrate all the planter's toil; Yet not ungrateful shall the clay With beans a plenteous crop repay.— Let peasant hinds, replies the squire, Whose grov'ling souls can rise no higher, Drudge on, content with piddling gain From vulgar means, and common grain; But I will make this Northern Isle With India's boasted harvest smile, And shew how needless 'tis to roam For what we may produce at home.— He said, and wide as his command, Tobacco filled the hungry land; The restive marl obstructs the shoot, And checks the plant, and kills the root. Yearly his project he repeated, Yearly he saw his hopes defeated. Till all, at length, his fate deplore, And find him begging at their door. Thus may'st thou see, discerning Browne, A sauntering croud infest the town; Whom providential Nature made To thrive in physic, law, or trade. What she directs, perverse they quit, And strive to force spontaneous wit; Mispend their time, misplace their toil, To cultivate a barren soil; And find no art or force can breed, What in your garden grows a Weed. ARCHIMAGE; A POEM, WRITTEN IN IMITATION OF SPENCER, AND DESCRIPTIVE OF THE AUTHOR AND FOUR OF HIS BOAT'S CREW. I A beauteous Maid Miss Trenchard, afterwards married to Jocelyn Pickard Esq. was walking on the plaine, Nigh where Sabrina rolls her yellow tyde, (Who now uplifts her fretted waves amaine, And now serenely doth like Thamis glyde;) Her palfrey to a distant tree was tied; Delighted with the stream, of nought afraid, She walk'd; a dwarf attended on her side, Who bore a shield, on which there was displayd Alofte on azure field a deadlie Trenchant The Crest of the Trenchard family. blade. II Happie the Knight, yea happiest he the Knight, By fates ordain'd that envied shield to beare, The dearest gift of honour'd Lady bright, To whom she worthy deems that pledge to weare, His sure protection in the doubtful warre; And ever shall such good the gifte attend, That whoso beareth it shall nothing feare, But on his Lady's virtues still depend, Trusting in her his Saint, his Patronesse and Friend. III Her loosely walking on the lonely shore Espied Archimage The Author. that wizard vile; And now the subtile fiend had got his lore; For whilom oft, with many an artful wile, And soothing words full fraught with hidden guile Her virtuous wisdom did the Mage assail; Nath'less unmoved remain'd she all the while, Ne would give ear to his false glozing tale, So that in no wise he against her mote prevail. IV Forthy to overt force now turns his mind. And impious ravishment the ruffian fell; For equal he to lawless force inclin'd, Or secret working of the magick spell, And every mystick charme he knew full well: Als could he from the vaste and hoarie deep Summon th' obedient sonnes of night and hell, As if th' infernal keys himself did keep; Ne e'er in mischief's tasks allow his eye-lids sleep. V Forthwith two hellish imps he calls amaine, Ycleped Giant Strength and Lawless Might; Each to array he turns his working braine In garb and semblance fair of gentle Knight; So with a two-edged weapon he mote fight. Thereto he Courtesie the one did call, The other counterfeit Persuasion hight; So if to nought his specious arts did fall, By ruffian force he mote be sure to work her thrall. VI And now the bold Inchaunter caus'd be brought, Of strange and curious worke, a rich machine His double Boat.; Which by his skille right cunninglie was wrought, So that it's paragonne mote not be seene; (Full powerful is the magick art, I weene.) Ne drawn by dragons was this sumptuous Carre, Ne by dread lions on the level greene, Ne yet by yoked swans along the air; As wizards oft, we read, convey the ravish'd fair. VII But with his wond'rous and all-powerful breath, And the bare motion of his felon hond Guiding the Helm., To whate'er parts he lists he travelleth, And flies with ease to many a distant lond; For of his prey he now possess'd doth stand. Als his behests four wizards The Boat's Crew. sage obey, Each waving in his hand a powerful wand The Oar.; Mightie themselves; but mightier he than they; Ne mote they his commands at any time gainsay. VIII In the first rank a wily Mage A servant of the Author. did sit, Long vers'd in fraud, and exercised in ill; Ne scrupled e'er t' employ his wicked wit, His master's dev'lish mandates to fulfille; And with malicious spite he turned stille 'Gainst Elfinne Knights, and wrought them mickle woe; Als wou'd the blood of holy beadsmen He shaved a Clergyman then resident in the family, and dress'd his wigs spille, Whose hairy scalps he hanged in a row Around his cave; sad sight to Christian eyes I trow! IX These would he with a deadlie engine fell Harrow and claw, his foul heart to aggrate, And wreak his malice, strange it is to tell, On object senseless and inanimate; As though it were his living foeman's pate. Als wou'd he rub a magic ointment eft O'er heads of luckless knights, such was his hate; Which of their curled tresses them bereft, That nought but naked scorne and baldness vile was left. X Next sate a monstrous and mishapen wight, His nether parts unseemlie to beholde; All from his waiste discovering to the sight A fishe's tail, with many a circling folde, A Fisherman. Which from the sea he mote not long witholde; Als in his hideous and Cyclopean front He had lost an eye. One single eye-ball (ghastlie feature!) roll'd, Which fill'd with horror whoso look't upon 't, And sea and land alike were this foule wizard's wont. XI But chief frequented he rough Neptune's reign, Where with his dread Inchaunments cast about, He'd call the fishe up from the wat'ry plain, Shad, salmon, turbot, sturgeon, sole and trout; Ne 'scap'd the smaller frie, ne larger rout; But all who in his magick circles caught, Ne great ne small mote ever thence get out; Such power alass! have fell Inchaunters got, Ne aught can them resist, ne can escape them aught. XII Yet not for appetite or hunger keen, Or for the end of luscious luxurie, Did he thus labour day and night, I ween, And those delicious creatures doom to die, But barely to aggrate his crueltie. For aye such joy in mischief would he take, That oft he'd run and flounce and wade and flie Like goose unwieldie or like waddling drake, And thus pursue his prey still flound'ring through the lake. XIII Ne would he e'er exchange these 'steemed cates For life-supporting bread, or wholesome food, Ne fill his body ere with strength'ning meats, But ev'ry thing eschewing that is good, Nought ate or drank which mote not evil brood: Hot and rebellious liquors were his meal, Which caus'd foul workings in his fev'rish blood; 'Bove all things else he Wassel priz'd and ale; For Tritonne, when in drinke, begotte him on a Whale. XIV The next a foul and filthy Wizard A Shoemaker. was; His skin like hydes of leather did appear; A griezlie beard grew matted o'er his face; Hard wax distilled from his eyes so blear, And on his back grew stiffe and brieslie hair; Which like th' enraged porcupine he 'd dart 'Gainst skinne of such as him provoked ere; And ever glad to do them shame and smart, Left them all slash'd and gored and pink'd in every part. XV From noblest auncestors his birth he 'd boast, E'en from the mightie Crispin's royal bed; Tho' he in fortune's ruder waves was tost, And by the potent Archimage was led; Nay once by mightier force imprisonned Had been arrested for debt., Altho' himself a great Inchaunter was; Untill released thro' grace and bountihed Of good and gentle Knight of Crispin's race, From barres of hardest steel, and walles of triple brasse. XVI Yet by superior force not overmatch'd, Well knew he how to deal the secret spell: Thereto the steps of wand'ring Knights he watch'd, And with smooth words decoy'd them to his cell His Shop.; Where in a chair enchaunted, strange to tell, The Knights he placed; when thrusting all amaine I' the stocks Ready-made Shoes. their tender feet, the traytor fell Leaves them, regardless of their bitter paine; There may they weep and wail, and storm and rave in vaine. XVII Next the most dread Magician A Blacksmith and Farrier. of the crew, Save the all-powerful Archimage alone, Of strange and hideous forme, and sable hue, Fire from his mouthe and livid eye-balls shone, Would melt harde flints and most obdurate stone. Thick clouds of smoke still issued from his nose, Which he in danger hath about him throwne; His iron nailes the length of fingers rose, Ne brasse, ne hardest steele, mote his sharpe teeth oppose. XVIII He was to weet a craftie subtile Mage, Great Vulcan's sonne, and from his Sire full well Had learn'd the winds rude force and mightier rage Of fire, which oft he'd fetch with many a spell, And bold Promethean arts, from lowest hell. In a vaste cave did this Inchaunter wonne, Full of things foul to see and sadde to tell; With many a rotten sculle and bleached bone, And many a mangled lymb was the dread pavement strowne. XIX Als on the portals of his friendless gate He fixed has, and hanged up on highe The boastfull tokens of his vengefull hate, And spoils of his lamented victorie, Extorting tears from every tender eye; When luckless Knights by him dismounted are, He straitway to the helpless steed doth flie; Soon from his tender foot the sole doth teare, And home the mournful trophie of his conquest beare. His Forge. XX Nor so he lets escape the haplesse steede, But daie by daie doth racke him more and more; Now strikes his tender necke till it doth bleede, And his sleek skyn becomes all cover'd o'er With the foule stains of bloode and clotted gore; Als with hotte pyncers dothe he feare his tongue, And with sharpe nails his feet he pricketh sore; Which makes him frette, as tho' by gadflie stunge, Whilst his gall'd hoofe still smarts, in magick circle wrunge. XXI Als hath the Wizard with paternal art, He assisted in building Glo'ster Gaol. And massie beams of ir'n, a castle wrought, So surelie firme and barr'd in ev'ry part, That never thence, I ween, escaped aught; With many a Knight and woeful Squire was fraught This dolorous dungeon sad, who thither came By magick touch, and vile inchauntments brought Of harpies fell, who take their obscene name Bum Bailiff. Deriv'd from loathed part of scorne, and public shame. XXII Whilom the wretche against his master dar'd In bold rebellion lift his traitor hand, And for his steeds his treas'nous charms prepar'd; But Archimage his purpose had forescann'd, And him in terror to that lawless band Condemned aye to sweat and toil amain; Now in the waves, now on the burning sand, From scorching flames to the chill wave again; Thus aye him tort'ring with varietie of pain. XXIII Such was this dev'lish and unholie crew; But far above them all was Archimage; More artful tricks and subtile wyles he knew; More high, more potent, more rever'd, more sage; Ne one like him could read the magick page: Ne could the powers of all combin'd avail 'Gainst his bare breath; so potent was it's rage, That oft with that alone he would assail The greatest deeds, nor ere in ought was known to fail. XXIV Als was he balde behinde, and polled o'er, And once escap'd none caught him e'er, I trowe: One single lock He wore a toupee of his own hair, comb'd over his wig. of hair he has before, Such whilom on Time's aged fronte dothe grow; (For he like Time ranne ever to and fro, Following the bente of his impetuous minde) This must you catch, ere he beginne to go, For if once gone he flieth like the winde, Ne ere abateth speed, ne looketh ere behinde. XXV Erst by his charmes a wond'rous bow Alluding to his expert use of the Bow and Arrow. he brought Ev'n from the distante coasts of utmost Inde; With dread and powerful magick was it wrought; And feather'd arrows, swifter than the winde, Which never erred from the marke design'd: These as the tim'rous fowl from far descrie, (Sore dread, I ween, to all the feather'd kinde) Dismay'd, dispers'd, and cowring low, they flie, Tho' oft transfix'd their lives they leave ith' loftie skie. XXVI Nature to him her dark breast doth disclose, His pierceant eye looks thro' the shades of night; And all beneath the earth and sea he knows, Ne ought is hidden from his searching sight: Eft rare and secret things he brings to light; And Earth's deep womb ransacking with his art, An house A Grotto, ornamented with Mundic, Spars, &amp;c. hath built with various beauties dight, (Not found, I ween, in ev'ry common mart,) Gold glitters all around, and shines in ev'ry part. XXVII Als on the confines of his drear domaine A loftie Tower The Parish Church, situated near his house. rears it's tremendous height; From off whose goodlie battlements are seen Extensive scenes of wonder and delight: But in a gulph The Church-yard. are her foundations pight; Which, tho' conceal'd with verdure fair, doth gape, Unseen, both night and day, for living wight: And ill betide that caitiffe, whose mishappe Dothe lead him to the pitte, whence he can ne'er escape. XXVIII So wills that darke and sable-stoled Mage, Who in those walles his art dothe exercise; Ne ought with him availeth sexe or age; Ne hoary elde, ne tender infant's cries Can melt his iron heart in any wise: Als by his power and virtue magicalle, A wond'rous yoke about their neckes he ties, Which eft their tender skinnes doth frette and galle, All silkenne as it seems, with sore and endlesse thralle. XXIX So surelie firme he ties this Gordian Knotte, As ev'n exceeds his own art to untie; And so ill-suited deals to each their lotte, Using his wicked arts so wantonlie, His cruel sport doth cause great miserie: Each ill-pair'd Couple tugge the magick chaine, And their reluctant neckes together plie, And still for freedom praie and strive amaine; He sits and laughs to scorne their labour, all in vaine. AN APOLOGY FOR WRITING VERSE; ADDRESSED TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES YORKE. (Written in the Year 1745.) THO' all the censuring World upbraid, That thus I ply this idle trade, That, strangely singular, I leave What they call useful, great, or grave, To follow Phoebus and the Muses; Yet you, my Charles, could find excuses, And back your reasons with example, To make th' apology more ample: Or, if the Bard should bring a fit one, Found or in ancient Greece or Britain, With pleasure wou'd the Tale attend, That serves to vindicate your friend. A Case I'll send you from a book, Rabelais, “Prologue to Book 3d.” A case in point, tho' not in Coke.— When Philip's warlike preparations Spread terror round the neighbouring nations, All prompted by their sev'ral fears, Provide their bucklers, swords, and spears; Obedient to the Mason's call, They roll the stones and raise the wall, And work as patriot ardour fired 'em; The very women too bestir'd 'em; For Corinth's lusty dames we're told Were mettled combatants of old: Mean while Diogenes alone At ease surveys the busy town, And stalks with philosophic pace, Contemplating each earnest face; At length the Cynic grasp'd his club, And fell in warlike mood to drub That peaceful domicil his tub; As if he meant t' avenge the quarrel Of Greece on th' outside of his barrel; Or humble Philip's pride by jerking The sides of sympathetic firkin. And now the Sage began to roll His passive vessel like a bowl; When thus a stander-by, “Pray neighbour, Why dost thou thy poor tub belabour? Why thus mispend thy time and wit But to torment thyself and it?”— “And art thou at this busy season At loss to find th' apparent reason?” The Sage replies: “sure you might chide well, If I alone should now stand idle; When all with me embark'd together, This dark suspicious low'ring weather, Are striving hard to keep afloat The common weal, our leaky boat: While at the pump or oar they tug hard, Shall I appear the only sluggard? What tho' my talents not avail To guide the helm or hand the sail, Yet shall it ne'er be said, that I Thro' sloth or indolence lay by.”— He said, and strait resum'd his task, And bounc'd and thwack'd the trundling cask. Thus I, who midst this restless crowd Capricious nature has allow'd Such parts and talents, as might serve To help some wretched wit to starve, With pleasure see my busy friends, Earnest alike for various ends; While these the means of peace prepare; These arming 'gainst the chance of war; Alike all anxious for their fate, And lab'ring to preserve the state. Yet I, t' amuse the vacant hour, Careless of honours, wealth, or power, Civic or military fame; Nor hoping praise nor fearing shame, Still ply like him my idle game. TO WILLIAM WHITEHEAD, Esq. (IN ANSWER TO AN EPISTLE TO THE AUTHOR, INSERTED IN HIS LIFE.) CEASE, Whitehead, to lavish on others the fame Which you better deserve, and unenvied may claim: The Muses, your Bankers, all honour your hand, When you draw for a Rhime you're paid on demand, All in specie, all gold, current coin of the land. On my poor shallow Bank the call scarce is begun, Ere my Muse pays in silver to ward off the run. What Dæmon possess'd me, when first for my crimes I sat down to blot paper with dissonant rhimes! Storms blacken'd and thunder affrighted the night: The raven and screech owl forbad me to write. Had I never engag'd in this idle employ, My heart vacant of care, and o'erflowing with joy, I had laught at all those, who to business are martyrs, Like a resident canon or captain in quarters; Dissolving in indolence, thoughtlessly gay, I had slept all the night, and done nothing all day; Contented from drum to assembly to dance, As invited by card, situation, or chance; Bow'd, saunter'd, and gap'd, a mere Man of the Town, And ask'd others their health, and not injur'd my own. But e'er since the first moment this phrenzy possest And disturb'd with wild vapours the calm of my breast; Day The Reader will see, that this is an ironical allusion to that part of Mr. Whitehead's Epistle, where he describes the remarkable facility with which the Author always composed. and night have I toil'd, like a slave in the mines, Retouching, transposing, new moulding my lines. Then, how nauseously sounds the addition of Poet, What pain to be markt, and how awkward to know it! Oft he hears, when he 's stuck in the midst of a crowd, Some whisper his name, some repeat it aloud, Or stare in his face to examine each feature, For a poet to them is a strange kind of creature. Fops, Belles, Beaux-esprits flock round him, and court all His acquaintance to visit,—his friendship no mortal. Wits sneer, the fools laugh, friends as usual must blame; Cardelio condemns, in the midst of his game: The learn'd shake their heads, the unletter'd abuse, The dull rogues thank their God they're not plagu'd with a Muse. —My Ambition is chill'd with this dreadful review, And I bid all poetic delusions adieu. TO LORD BATHURST. IMITATION OF HORACE, Lib. 2. Ode 15. ALREADY your extensive Down O'er all the neighb'ring land has grown, And laid whole Forests waste: And now we see th' encroaching Lake Almost as large a compass take: And all to found a Taste. Misguided Emulation now The fertile empire of the plough To barren shew devotes; Or vainly strives some marsh to drain, To counterfeit thy wholesome plain, Or richest meadow floats. Now flow'rs dispos'd in various groupes, Dislodge those honours of your soups, The tasteful rich Legumes: And, rais'd in mounts, or sunk in wells, From artless tufts, or labour'd shells, Dispense their strong perfumes. How would your friend Sir Godfrey Sir Godfrey Kneller. fret! And Pope, in plaintive strains, regret The days of his Queen Anne? Before you sunk the first Ha-ha; And ruling all by Forest-Law, This wasting Taste began. The Monarch, worthy Britain's crown, Sought not in private fields renown: And none by her example, Did castles for their porter rear, A Chinese pagode for their deer, Or for their horse a temple. The turf her humble subjects made Their lowly seat, beneath the shade Of beeches, oaks, or birches: And to their pious Queen they gave Whate'er their patriot thrift could save, For building fifty churches. THE DANGER OF WRITING VERSE; A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A YOUNG POET AND HIS FRIEND. ADDRESSED TO SIR CHARLES HANBURY WILLIAMS, KNT. Occasioned by his satirical Ode upon Mr. Hussey's Marriage with the Duchess of Manchester; which gave so much personal Offence. Quem tu, Melpomene, semel Nascentem placido lumine videris, Illum non labor Isthmius Clarabit pugilem; non equus impiger Curru ducet Achaico Victorem; neque res bellica Deliis Ornatum foliis ducem, Quod regum tumidas contuderit minas, Ostendet Capitolio. Hor. Od. iii. FRIEND. THE Man at whose birth Melpomene smil'd, Who fancies forsooth he 's Apollo's own child, In the country indulges an indolent ease, And will make neither Sportsman nor Justice of Peace. POET. Will our Poet succeed any better in town? Is he likely to rise by the Sword or the Gown? FRIEND. Lackaday sir, the Muse has so addled his pate, That he finds himself fit for no post in the state. POET. But Horace, your friend, though his sons you abuse, Shews the dignity, value, and charms of the Muse: FRIEND. 'Tis true, sir, but there he has chose to conceal, What I, for the sake of young Bards, shall reveal: Then know, this profession but tends to expose To the fear of your friends, the revenge of your foes. Will the man, by your Verses once injur'd, forgive, Tho' the cause of his pain shou'd no longer survive? All your friends tho' unhurt, you observe, are perplext With a jealous concern, lest their turn should be next. POET. But, good sir, what need that the Bard must abuse? Let him sport with an innocent Pastoral Muse: FRIEND. I grant, and the World will allow there 's no need; You may chuse what you'll write, but they 'll chuse what they read; And, dear ignorant Friend, to make short of the matter, There's nothing will please 'em but personal satire: Nor fancy the world will e'er call for your rhimes, Unless they believe 'em a touch on the times; Of this truth artful Pope may an instance afford, Who nam'd his late Work from the Year of our Lord. This Horace confest: for that Poet divine, Who at first wrote his Odes to his mistress and wine, Soon with Character fill'd the satyrical page, And adapted his Muse to the taste of the age. But satire 's a thing, that 'tis dang'rous to deal in, For tho' many want taste, yet there 's none but has feeling. This duly consider'd, the Poet disclaim, Nor let Horace inveigle your fancy with fame; For the reason why he can unenvied divert us, Is because we are sure he 's unable to hurt us; His Characters touch not the Moderns; and no man Sees himself or his nation expos'd in a Roman: Yet were he alive, I should think it, tho' loth, My duty to give this advice to you both. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN LORD DUCIE AND HIS HORSE. (Written in the Year 1748.) DUCIE. O the dull lazy dog, how untimely he fails, When in view we 've the Prince and the Princess of Wales! Is this a fit time, you ungrateful, to flinch? HORSE. You may whip me and spur me; I'll not stir an inch. I wish I 'd been Cambridge's, then I had seen Hay and oats for my dinner and tasted a bean, Which your Pythagorick decrees have forbid; And that makes me so faint, I 'ant fit to be rid. DUCIE. I 'll convince you how foolish the outcry which you make; What signify Oats if you 're rid of your stomach? Without scruple, I grant, when extravagant Vesie Lord Ducie's Steward. Gave his horse Hay and Oats, you were justly uneasy. But with Cambridge's horses 'tis quite a new case; They are trying to make you displeas'd with your place; 'Tis the way of all servants; but pray, do they say How many long miles they are rid in a day? How oft the poor devils are gallopt to Villiers? I'll warrant they often have envied my Thillers The horse that goes between the shafts.. Did you e'er know me out when pronouncing the doom Prophetic of Cambridge's annual groom? Now if he kills a groom once a twelvemonth, or more, Of horses at least he must kill half a score. He cares little for 'em, and feels no more pain, If in harvest it pours down whole buckets of rain; While I and my servants are toiling all day, In the heat of the sun to roast you your hay. With his good friend the World on the water he goes, And calls off his hands to his barges and shows. But you want to change for his place, you 're so cunning; Did he ever build you a stable to run in? Have you seen in his fields such a house as your own, With one pillar of brick and another of stone? No, no, sir, he builds you your buildings of taste: And so all his fortune is running to waste. Am I ever profuse in wigs, waistcoats, or coats, In castles or porticos, bridges or boats? HORSE. What's all this to me, if I never eat Oats? THE AUTHOR TO THE SCRIBLERIAD. IM. HOR. EPIS. 20. WELL then, for all that I have said, You keep your eyes on Tully's head. Has pride with such impatience fill'd you, You pine till Dodsley clothe and gild you; As foppish minors court their taylor, And hate their guardian as their gaoler. 'Tis so, you an't content, you say With Barnard, Whitehead, Yorke, and Wray. No more you 'll visit squeamish Wits, So often in their absent fits: No more be read alone to Browne; But go at once upon the Town. Go then, you 'll never think me wise, Till Wits begin to criticise, And doom you to the trunks or pies. Or, if it happens for a while, Your novelty should make 'em smile, Soon will you think of my advice, When the cloy'd reader grows so nice: For something new he throws you by, Where you o'erwhelm'd forgot must lye; Where daily pamphlets shall confound you, And Night Thoughts ever growing round you. But while their favour you maintain, (For 'tis as short liv'd as 'tis vain) Thus much of me you may declare, That tho' I live in Country air, And with a snug retirement blest, Yet oft, impatient of my nest, I spread my broad and ample wing, And in the midst of action spring. A great admirer of great men, And much by them admir'd again. My body light, my figure slim, My mind dispos'd to mirth and whim: Then on my Family hold forth, Less fam'd for Quality than Worth. But let not all these points divert you From speaking largely of my Virtue. Should anyone desire to hear a Precise description of your Æra, Tell 'em that you was on the anvil, When Bath came into pow'r with Granville. When they came in you were about, And not quite done when they went out Their Administration lasted only three days.. THE SCRIBLERIAD: AN HEROIC POEM, IN SIX BOOKS. THE SCRIBLERIAD. BOOK I. ARGUMENT The Poet, in proposing his Subject, discovers Saturn, or Time, to be an enemy to his Hero. Then briefly touching the cause of his enmity, hastens into the midst of things, and presents Scriblerus with his Associates traversing the vast desarts of Africa, in quest of the Petrified City. Saturn, perceiving he has now an opportunity of consummate revenge, by depriving the Hero of his Life, and, what is far more dear to him, his Fame; prevails on Æolus to raise, by a whirlwind, a Storm of sand over his head, and to bury him and his companions at once in oblivion. Scriblerus's speech; he discovers the utmost magnanimity; and scorning so base a death, by an unparalleled presence of mind, erects a structure of all his rarities, and setting fire to it, prepares to throw himself amidst the flames. The god, taking the sacrifice of so large a collection as a full submission, consents to spare his life; but, to frustrate his present expectations, directs the cloud of dust to fall on the Petrified City, which is thereby buried. Scriblerus, unable to survive the loss of his treasures, is prevented from prosecuting his design of burning himself by a miracle, wrought by the interposition of the god Momus. After a fruitless search of six days more, his companions press him to return. Scriblerus's speech to them: he persists in his resolution of continuing the search, till he is dissuaded from it by Albertus, who relates to him a fictitious dream. Scriblerus pronounces an Eulogy on prophetic Dreams. He recounts his own dream; and laments the scarcity and uncertainty of all other modern Oracles. Albertus advises him to consult a Morosoph, whom he describes. The much-enduring man, whose curious soul Bore him, with ceaseless toil, from pole to pole, Insatiate, endless knowledge to obtain, Thro' woes by land, thro' dangers on the main, New woes, new dangers destin'd to engage, By wrathful Saturn's unrelenting rage, I sing. Calliope, the cause relate, Whence sprung the jealous god's immortal hate. Long had his scythe, with unresisted sway, Spread wide his conquests: All around him lay The boastful victims that proclaim'd him great, And earth-born splendor perish'd at his feet; When, like the Titans, the Scriblerian line Oppos'd, with mortal arms, his pow'r divine; From dark oblivion snatch'd the mould'ring spoil, Work'd as he work'd, and baffled force with toil. Hence first the god's severe resentment flow'd, Till ripen'd vengeance in his bosom glow'd. Scriblerus now had left the fruitful Nile: (At once the nurse and parent of the soil.) Say, goddess, say, what urgent cause demands His dang'rous travel o'er the pathless sands. In one dread night, a petrifying blast, Portentous, o'er astonish'd Africk past; Whose fury, spent on one devoted town, Transform'd the whole, with Gorgon force, to stone. Each softer substance, in that direful hour, Ev'n life, confess'd the cold petrific pow'r. While yet she plies the dance, the buxom maid Feels the chill pangs her stiffen'd limbs invade: Thro' the warm veins of boiling youth they spread, And fix the bridegroom in the genial bed. Big with this scene, which all his soul possess'd, Nine days Scriblerus trod the dreary waste. When Saturn thus: Behold, this hour demands The long-stor'd vengeance from my tardy hands. How oft have Mars and Vulcan swept away The pride of nations in one wrathful day? Inferior pow'rs! shall I, their elder, bear With this rebellious race a ling'ring war? Or, by one vig'rous and decisive blow, At once their triumphs and their hopes o'erthrow? Now, fixt in wrath, the sounding vault he gains Where Æolus his airy sway maintains. When thus: Dread monarch of this drear abode, Hear my request, assist a suppliant god. If, by my friendly aid, the mould'ring tow'r Totters, at length, a victim to thy pow'r: If e'er my influence to thy force was join'd, O! calm the pangs of my long-suff'ring mind. Torn from my arms, a daring traitor bears The labors of a thousand anxious years. Loaded with these, his sacrilegious bands, From eldest Egypt, trace the Libyan sands. Haste, then, the friendly office to perform: Call all thy winds, and swell th' impetuous storm. Roll the dry desart o'er yon impious host, Till, with their hopes, their memory be lost. So spake the god. Th' aërial king comply'd, And, with his sceptre, struck the mountain's side. Loud thunders the rent rock; and from within, Out rush, resistless, with impetuous din, The hoarse rude winds; and sweeping o'er the land, In circling eddies whirl th' uplifted sand. The dusty clouds in curling volumes rise, And the loose mountain seems to threat the skies. Th' astonish'd band behold, with ghastly fear, Their fleeting grave suspended in the air. Thus they unmanly, while the dauntless chief Betray'd no passion but indignant grief; Which thus broke forth: How bless'd the man whose name From glorious death assumes its brightest fame. O! had kind fate ordain'd me to expire, Like great Empedocles in Ætna's fire! Had I partook immortal Pliny's doom; (Had fam'd Vesuvio's ashes been my tomb:) Or shar'd the fate of yon portentous town, And stood, my own sad monument, a stone; Wide o'er the world my spreading fame had rung, By ev'ry muse in ev'ry region sung. “A shameful fate now hides my hapless head, “Un-wept, un-noted, and for ever dead. Yet—for I scorn the base ignoble death, Nor will I to vile dust resign my breath, —Be something done, worthy each moment past, And O! not unbecoming of the last. Let the brave phœnix my example be, (That phœnix, now alas! I ne'er must see) His pile magnific the great thought inspire, And my choice treasures light the glorious pyre. Then will I rise amid the circling flame, In death a rival to Calanus' fame. No more shall Greece or Rome their heroes boast, But all their pride in envy shall be lost. He said. His friends in pyral order laid Six ample coffins of the royal dead: The tree which bears imperial Pharoah's name, By age uninjur'd form'd their lasting frame. On these, two mighty crocodiles were plac'd; O'er which an huge unmeasur'd skin was cast: This spoil the hippopotamus bestow'd: Scarce four stout youths support the pond'rous load. On the broad skin the sage with pious pains Dispos'd the six great monarchs dear remains; Sesostris, Pheron, and his virtuous dame, Cheops, Psammetichus, immortal name! And Cleopatra's all-accomplish'd frame. This done, two camels from the troop he slays, And the pil'd fat around the mummie lays. Next, ravish'd from the sacred catacomb, He draws the Ibis from his conic tomb. Fossils he plac'd and gawdy shells around; The shield, his cradle once, the structure crown'd. High on the corners of the ample base Egyptian sculpture claims an honour'd place. Here bold Osiris' awful form! appears: Great Isis there the hallow'd sistrum bears. Harpocrates, the worship of the wise: And proud Canopus, conscious of the prize, The vanquish'd rival of his pow'r defies. The structure now compleat, the anxious chief Brings forth the dry Papyrus' sacred leaf: A sigh from his unwilling bosom broke; Then thus, collected in himself, he spoke: Illustrious souls of Munster and of Greece! Tho' hére at once my hopes and suff'rings cease; Nor shall I, like my ancestors at home, My country polish with the labour'd tome; Nor by my travel (as the Samian sage Enlighten'd Greece) instruct the present age; Revive the long-lost arts of ancient war, The deathful scorpion, and the scythe-girt car; Or share, with Numa, civic fame, and found Old Plato's patriot laws on modern ground: These deep-laid schemes tho' Saturn's wrath o'erthrow, (His anger rising as my honours grow) Virtue shall yet her sure reward receive, And one great deed my dying fame retrieve. Then, thrice invoking each auspicious name, Thro' the light reed he spreads the wasting flame; The melted gums, in fragant volumes rise, And waft a various incense to the skies; The unctuous fewel feeds the greedy fire, And one bright flame enwraps the blazing pyre. Joy touch'd the victor god's relenting mind, Who thus address'd the monarch of the wind: To thee, indulgent deity, I owe This full submission of the stubborn foe. See what vast tribute one important hour Brings to my throne, and subjects to my pow'r. Enough. This ample sacrifice alone The thefts and crimes of ages shall atone. Yet tho' I deign his abject life to spare, Think not the wretch my further grace shall share. Nor shall his rebel soul, insulting, boast Successful toils where armies have been lost.— O'er the proud town, his vain pursuit, shall fall Yon hov'ring mass, and hide her long-sought wall; That no remembrance, but an empty name, Be left to vindicate her doubtful fame. He said. Already the tumultuous band, With prompt obedience, hear their king's command, Forbear the conflict, and to Eurus yield The long-contested honors of the field. Sudden the loaded atmosphere was clear'd, The glad horizon and bright day appear'd. Freed from the horrors of impending fate, Each raptur'd friend salutes his rescu'd mate: But not such transports touch'd Scriblerus' breast, His glorious purpose all his soul possess'd. In vain to deprecate the rash design, With tears his friends their fond entreaties join. Alas! he cries, what boots it now to live? Since I my perish'd treasures must survive. Cut from my hopes, by this devouring fire, While yet I may, O! let me mount the pyre. Again should wild tornados bring despair, When hov'ring death shall threaten from the air, This pile consum'd, remains there ought to save My body from an ignominious grave? Let vulgar souls for doubtful life contend; Be mine the boast of an heroic end. This Momus heard; and, from Olympus' height, To distant Libya wing'd his rapid flight. Sudden he joins the rash Scriblerus' side, While good Albertus' form the god belied. Instant, behold! the guardian pow'r commands A spark to issue from the blazing brands; Which fell, directed, on the sage's head, And sudden flames around his temples spread. The subtle god the destin'd moment watch'd: Swift from his head the hairy texture snatch'd, And, unperceiv'd, amidst the croud's amaze, A soaring rocket in the cawl conveys. The latent fraud, portentous, cuts the air, And bears, thro' distant skies, the blazing hair. When thus the god, in sage Albertus' voice: Behold this wond'rous omen, and rejoice. Lo! great Scriblerus, what the fates unfold; At length convinc'd, thy rash attempt with-hold. The gods declare that thy illustrious head Such effluent glory shall around thee shed, As, wide dispensing its eternal rays, Shall fill th' enlighten'd nations with amaze. The yielding chief observes the heav'n-mark'd road, Accepts the omen, and obeys the god. Six anxious days they trace the dreary plains With fruitless search; so Saturn's wrath ordains. His murm'ring friends the scant provision mourn, And urge th' unwilling hero to return. But stern resentment fires his glowing breast; While thus his wrath th' indignant sage express'd. O dastard slaves, from glory's field to fly, And basely tremble ere the danger's nigh! Can you, full-feasted, mutter discontent, Ignobly faint ere half your stores are spent? Return, unworthy of the gen'rous toil, Back to the sluggish borders of the Nile. Faithful Albertus shall alone partake Those dear-bought honours which your fears forsake: Cowards, reflect on Cato's steadier host, Unmov'd and dauntless on this dreary coast; Like them, in all our travel, have we found Asps in the well, or serpents in the ground! Have we th' invading basilisk to fear? Or winged poisons darting through the air? Yet not these perils shook their firmer souls; While your resolves a distant fear controuls: Dampt with the prospect of a future dearth, Nor dare ye trust the all-sustaining earth. Nigh to these plains, a nation seek their food, High in the branches of the lofty wood; From the green boughs they crop the recent sprout, And feed luxurious on the tender shoot. Southward the hard Rhizophagi prepare, With marshy roots, their coarse yet wholesome fare. From slimy Nile the rank unsav'ry reed, A pounded mass, in artless loaves they knead: And in the sun-beams bake the bulbous bread. The fierce Bisaltæ milk the nursing mare, Mix her rich blood, and swill the luscious fare: And the foul Cynocephalus sustains, With her drain'd udder, the Medimnian swains. Strange to relate! near fam'd Hydaspes' flood, For their support they rear the pois'nous brood; The viper, toad, and scorpion, are their food. Nay, ev'n in these uncultivated plains, The swarming locust feeds the hungry swains. Far-length'ning fires extend along the coast, And intercept the close-embattled host. Firm and compact, the troops in deep array, Urg'd from behind, pursue their deathful way. The swains with salt their future feast prepare, And one boon hour supplies the wasting year. And doubt we now our journey to extend, While yet our beasts beneath their burthens bend? Whose flesh alone might all our wants supply, And give not only life, but luxury. Faint with the distant chase, the Tartar drains Reviving cordials from his courser's veins! The hungry trav'ller in the dreary waste From the slain camel shares a rich repast: While parch'd with thirst, he hails the plenteous well, Found in the stomach's deep capacious cell: Ev'n their tough skins an hard support might yield; And soldiers oft have eat the stubborn shield. Thus far the sage. When viewing all around Their wearied eyes in sleep's soft fetters bound, Stretch'd on the sand, he leaves the slumb'ring crew, Himself indignant to his tent withdrew. Rous'd with the dawn, the good Albertus bent His careful footsteps to the sage's tent. Earnest he seem'd, with meditated art, Some deep important counsel to impart. When thus: This night when sleep had clos'd mine eyes, I saw a band of glorious forms arise: The great Albertus, author of my line, And all that boast affinity to thine: The princely Scaligers, illustrious name! Scribonius, and profound Bombastus, came; When thus thy fire: O! foremost to attend The glorious labours of thy daring friend, Be thine the task th' unwelcome news to bear: Friendship can smooth the front of rude despair. Yet ever must my son despair to see Yon city, buried by the god's decree: Mountains of sand her loftiest turrets hide, And swell the loaded plain on ev'ry side; As vain thy search for Heraclea's grave, Or Sodom sunk beneath th' Asphaltic wave. He said. I listen'd further yet to hear, When warlike sounds alarm'd my startled ear. I saw impetuous Scaliger advance: The rest around him form'd the Pyrrhic dance; They clash their javelins, ring their clanging shields, Till sleep unwilling to the tumult yields. Thus he, dissembling. The fond chief replies, (While filial raptures in his soul arise,) Well may'st thou grieve the glorious vision gone, Tho' much, alas! th' indulgent shades have shewn. O let me still, on this revolving day, A grateful tribute to their mem'ry pay: And to the genius of the horny gate, Whose friendly pow'r reveals our certain fate. Oft, by abstruse mysterious types, are told Those shadow'd truths instructive dreams unfold. When Media's sleeping monarch saw the maid A wond'rous deluge o'er his empire spread; How plain that emblem pointed him the place From whence should issue his severe disgrace! Olympia's pregnant womb when Philip seal'd, The mystic dream young Ammon's soul reveal'd. Stamp'd on the wax the victor lion shew'd The warlike genius of the embryo god. Thus has a figur'd omen, dark, and deep, To me been painted by the pow'rs of sleep. The fav'rite bird of Pallas I beheld Search, with unwearied wing, the new-reap'd field: Fatigued, at length, a lurking mouse he spies, And eager, to the long-sought quarry flies; Thither, by chance, the reaper bent his way, And, with a wheat sheaf, whelm'd the trembling prey. Th' Athenian bird his frustrate labor mourn'd, Flew from my sight, but soon again return'd, When, wond'rous to relate, he thus began, (An owl in figure, but in voice a man;) I come, no vulgar vision of the night, The gods direct my emblematic flight, In my sage form thy rev'rend self appears: Thy vain pursuit the vanish'd mouse declares. This said, the feather'd omen seeks the skies: And, instant, downy sleep forsook my eyes. I deem'd the phantom by the Saturn. god design'd, To shake the steady purpose of my mind. Now have thy words my vain suspicion eas'd, Confirm'd my soul, and ev'ry doubt appeas'd. But whither next the heav'n-taught course to steer, Nor omens point, nor friendly shades declare. And now, alas! in these unhallow'd days, No learned priest the sacrifice displays: Inspects the victim with prophetic eyes, Or reads the vagrant lessons of the skies. Nor sacred oracles afford their aid; Dumb is the Pythian and Cumæan maid. O! had we liv'd in that auspicious age, When roam'd the Trojan chief and Grecian sage, Some friendly Helenus we then had found, Or Anius, skill'd each omen to expound. Perhaps to hell's dark mansions we had gone, And fam'd Tiresias had our fortunes shown. Now nought remains our dubious course to guide, Since the Virgilian lots in vain were try'd. Then say, my friend, what counsel canst thou find, To fix the purpose of my wav'ring mind? Albertus then: Alas! too just thy grief! O might my heart suggest the wish'd relief! The sage Mahometans have ever paid Distinguished honours to the fool and mad: And wisely they. For oft, when reason wings Her flight, superior to terrestrial things, The thoughts beyond the starry mansions rove, Blest with the converse of the gods above; And thence to mortals' less exalted sense, Instructive truths, oracular, dispense. At Cairo sojourns a phrenetic sage, Inspir'd with all this theomantic rage. I mark'd where'er the Morosoph appear'd, (By crowds surrounded, and by all rever'd,) How young and old, virgins and matrons kiss'd The footsteps of the blest gymnosophist. The eager bride touch'd each propitious part That best prolific virtue might impart. Whilst on the sacred raptures of his tongue The list'ning multitudes, astonish'd, hung. Then haste we back to Cairo, I advise, And let the fool give counsel to the wise. An hope-born smile the Chief's assent express'd, And drove despair, sad inmate, from his breast. Fir'd with the wish'd return, the wearied band With shouts of joy receive the glad command: Already slighting the diminish'd toil Of scorching Sirius, and the faithless soil. THE END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. ARGUMENT. The Second Book leads the imagination, at once, from the barren desert to the most fruitful spot in the world, the ancient Arsinoe, now Faiume. Here Scriblerus meets a company of Pilgrims, formerly his father's friends, who desire him to relate his whole adventures to them. He begins his Narration. Gives an account of his waiting three years in vain at Naples to see the Eruption of Vesuvius. Purposes going to Jamaica in hopes of seeing an Earthquake. Sails with his friends, is driven by contrary winds below the Cape of Good Hope. Arrives at a most delightful country; which is described: but suddenly flies from it, moved by a fatal misinterpretation of an Oracle. Scriblerus, continuing his Narration, describes a wonderful coast, the surprising appearance of which strikes a damp on his companions. Deidemon and Thaumastes are chosen by lot to reconnoitre the country. At their return, they give a very imperfect account of their adventures, being stupified by excessive fear. Scriblerus sets out alone on a farther Discovery. And now, ten days in tedious travel past, At length they quit th' inhospitable waste. As Zembla's sons, benighted half the year, Exult when first the cheering rays appear, From the deep gloom when long-lost scenes arise, And earth and gayer heav'n salute their eyes: Such joys diffus'd Arsinoe's fertile plain, Such rapture seiz'd the late dejected train. From the tall hills, with transport they command The vast extent of that wide-water'd land: Where the same course sev'n copious rivers take, And, Mœris, fill thy deep capacious lake. They leave the spacious lab'rinth's ruin'd state, And, cheerful, enter proud Faiume's gate: When, lo! to meet them came a solemn band, The pilgrim's staff each bearing in his hand; Their hats with scallops grac'd; the Flemish green, In numerous crosses, on their robes was seen. Who thus: Hail, great Scriblerus, nor disdain A friendly welcome to this reverend train. By adverse fates and ceaseless tempests tost From sad Judæa's desolated coast, To Alexandria's port our course we steer'd, And there the hallow'd footsteps we rever'd Of princes, prelates, saints, and martyrs dead, Who greatly triumph'd, or who bravely bled. There first with joy we heard thy spreading fame; And thence to welcome thy return we came. But, generous sage, sincere and free declare, Are you, of manly growth, Scriblerus' heir? For sure his features in your look appear, And in the son the father we revere. Oft have I heard from my chaste mother's tongue, That from the great Cornelius' loins I sprung, The sage replies: but O! what mortal knows Th' undoubted sire to whom his birth he owes? O! might I now, tho' born of meaner race, With him the mazy paths of wisdom trace, With him unfold the metaphysick store, And science, thro' each dark recess, explore— But fate pronounc'd th' irrevocable doom, And death has sunk him in the silent tomb. Behold me now, deserted and forlorn, The sport of fortune and her abject scorn: Weary'd with woes, and old in travel grown,— Still flatt'ring hope reserv'd yon wond'rous town— Thither we journey'd; but the gods ordain Our search successless and our labour vain. Then they: With sympathetick grief we moan Thy fate, alas! so sad, so like our own. Yet say, Scriblerus, since thy daring soul, Superior still to fortune's vain controul, Has many a glorious enterprize atchiev'd, New arts invented and lost arts retriev'd; Say, shall thy friends thy various labours hear, And thy sage conduct glad their longing ear? Scriblerus then: Ah! seek not now to know A series of unutterable woe. For, lo! to Thetis' bed the god of day, Thro' western skies, precipitates his way. Give we to feast and sleep the peaceful night— To distant Cairo, with the morning light, Our course we speed: but if so great desire To hear our fates your friendly breasts inspire, As on the peaceful bosom of the Nile, We sail, the tedious passage to beguile, Your fond request, tho' hard, shall be obey'd, And every debt to sacred friendship paid. Soon as the sun th' enlightened vault ascends, Th' impatient chief embarks his ready friends. Now all in silence eyed the godlike man, Who thus with tears th' eventful tale began. From native Albion, a selected band, We spread the sail and reach th' Ausonian strand: The sacred flame which Pliny's breast inspir'd, Urg'd our resolves, and every bosom fir'd: But our dull stars th' expected boon delay, And three slow years steal unimprov'd away. Tho' heaving fire Vesuvio's womb distends, No bursting deluge o'er the plain descends. —O! curst impatience! O! severe disgrace! Scarce had we left, unwilling left, the place, When forth the flames, with wild explosion, broke, The lab'ring mountain to its basis shook: A molten deluge cover'd all the ground, And ashes fill'd the hemisphere around, Unmov'd, tho' baffled, we renew our toil, And seek, Jamaica, thy unstable soil. Where mountains rock, where yawning caverns roar, And bellowing gulphs sulphureous torrents pour; Majestic scene! whose aweful glories fire Our drooping souls, and kindle new desire. With prosp'rous gales, we reach Madeira's height, And load delicious wines, a welcome freight. Thence, o'er the bosom of the boundless sea, Twice ten days blest pursue th' unruffled way; When lo! deep clouds, with sable horrors rise, And, low'ring, menace from the western skies; Impetuous winds old ocean's face deform, The vessel drives before the swelling storm; Six long tempestuous weeks, by Corus tost, And borne far distant from the wish'd-for coast. Now as beneath the sultry line we run, We bear unshaded the meridian sun. Now far beyond the tropick as we stray, Mourn the weak influence of th' obliquer ray. Twice had the changeful moon full orb'd her light Display'd; twice yielded to the shades of night; When lo! at once the boist'rous winds subside, At once abates the restless rolling tide. Soft Zephyr rising o'er the wat'ry plain, Fans with his gentle wing the level main; When now Aurora, with auspicious light, Reveals a beauteous harbour to the sight. Bewitching scenes encompass us around, And the whole region seems enchanted ground. Gold buds and branches on the radiant trees, And melting musick floats on ev'ry breeze. From flowers, unfading thro' the varied year, Incense and ambergris perfume the air; Eternal verdure clothes the cloud-topt hills, In tuneful measure fall the tinkling rills; Rubies and em'ralds load the teeming groves, Where vocal phœnixes record their loves. The boars their sides in crystal fountains lave, The painted panther swims the briny wave. In myrtle groves the wanton dolphins play; While sea-calves o'er th' enamelled meadows stray. Around our ships the warbling mermaids glide, And with their musick sooth the swelling tide. Th' enchanting scene my ravish'd crew possest, And calentures had seiz'd on ev'ry breast; This I perceiv'd, and sudden gave command To drive the vessel on the oozy strand. Ere yet they touch'd the shore, th' impatient crew O'er the high decks with heedless rapture flew. And wand'ring onward, with amazement, found A well-spread table on the verdant ground. On beds of fragrant roses we recline, And quaff full bowls of unexhausted wine. Indulge with various meats unsated taste, And, thoughtless, revel in the rich repast. When issuing from the woods on either hand, In martial guise advanc'd a num'rous band. In martial guise they march'd: ill-judging fear Misdeem'd the pomp inhospitable war, Unmindful of Ascanius' harmless train, And bloodless battles on Sicilia's plain. Hence my rash hand, by fatal fury led, Drew show'rs of woes on each devoted head. Firm and compact in three fair columns wove, O'er the smooth plain, the bold Acrosticks move; High o'er the rest the tow'ring leaders rise With limbs gigantick and superior size. They lead the van, unmov'd in the career, And Bout-rimeès bring up the lagging rear. Not thus the looser Chronograms prepare, Careless their troops, undisciplin'd to war; With ranks irregular, confus'd, they stand, The chieftains mingling with the vulgar band. But with still more disorder'd march, advance (Nor march it seem'd, but wild fantastick dance) The uncouth Anagrams, distorted train, Shifting, in double mazes, o'er the plain. From different nations next the Centos crowd; With borrow'd, patcht, and motley ensigns proud. Not for the fame of warlike deeds they toil, But their sole end the plunder and the spoil. Next, an uncertain and ambiguous train Now forward march, then countermarch again. The van now first in order, duly leads, And now the rear the changeful squadron heads. Thus onward, Amphisbæna springs to meet Her foe; nor turns her in the quick retreat. To join these squadrons, o'er the champaign came A num'rous race of no ignoble name; The mighty Crambo leads th' intrepid van: The rest a forward loud industrious clan. Riddle, and Rebus, Riddle's dearest son; And false Conundrum, and insidious Pun; Fustian, who scarcely deigns to tread the ground; And Rondeau, wheeling in repeated round. Here the Rhopalics in a wedge are drawn, There the proud Macaronians scour the lawn. Here fugitive and vagrant o'er the green, The wanton Lipogrammatist is seen. There Quibble and Antithesis appear, With Doggrel-rhymes and Echos in the rear. On their fair standards, by the wind display'd, Eggs, altars, wings, pipes, axes were pourtray'd. Alarm'd and all-suspended with the sight, Nor yet determin'd to retire or fight, A wond'rous omen from directing fate, Fix'd our resolves, and urg'd our quick retreat. As on the ground, reclin'd, Thaumastes lay, Fill'd with the feasting of the genial day; (Uncertain if some godhead sway'd his mind, Or mov'd by chance) he broke the walnut's rind: Fear and amazement seiz'd his shuddering soul, When for the nut, he found a scribbled scroll. He trac'd the characters with secret dread; Then thus aloud the mystick verses read. In love the victors from the vanquis'd fly, They fly that wound, and they pursue that die. Silent a while and thoughtful we remain, At length the verse unanimous explain; That where no triumphs on the conquest wait, Ev'n virtue's self and honour bids retreat, So Jove declares, so wills eternal fate. With eager zeal, we hoist the spreading sails, And, from the deck, invoke the tardy gales. When now the shore the fancy'd armies reach, And form their mimick legions on the beach. Insulting shouts the deafen'd sense invade, Sarcasms and scoffing taunts our fears upbraid. I catch my bow, (the same which Aster bore 'Gainst the rash monarch on Thessalia's shore,) The string with meditated vengeance drew, And pierc'd a leader of th' acrostick crew. The giant scoffer falls consign'd to death, And thus, prophetic, sung his parting breath: C oward and slave, ne'er shalt thou reap the fruit O f thy long labours and severe pursuit. W ith sorrow shalt thou leave thy suff'ring crew, A venging justice shall their steps pursue, R ude draughts of iron shall they drink at need, D rink, and deplore thy rash inhuman deed. These threats denouncing, in the dust he rolls: Cold thrilling fear invades our troubled souls. Prostrate, we supplicate all-ruling Jove, Th' impending curse, relenting, to remove. With sad reluctance leave th' enchanting plain; And anxious plough the hoarse-resounding main. Nine tedious days a doubtful course we steer; The tenth, bold rocks and tow'ring cliffs appear. The least, as Atlas tall, o'erlook'd the strand: Nor shapeless they, but shap'd by nature's hand. Some like smooth cones aspiring to the skies, Others aloft in spiral volumes rise. These seem vast cannon planted on the shore, Well-turn'd and hollow'd with cylindrick bore. Here columns or tall obelisks appear; There a vast globe or polish'd hemisphere. Tow'ring on high proud battlements are seen: And saliant bastions bear a warlike mien. What breast, unmov'd, the dreadful sight could bear? What eye behold it unappall'd with fear! I strove their drooping courage to awake, And thus, with animating accents, spake: See, dear companions, what the gods have giv'n, And praise th' indulgence of propitious heav'n. How great the scene, where'er we turn our eyes! The prospects various all, yet all surprize. Ply well your oars to gain th' auspicious land; And raise a grateful altar on the strand. Then let some chief, by lot decreed, explore The latent glories of this wond'rous shore. Thus I, dissembling; but pale fear possest Each livid cheek, and chill'd each manly breast. Fresh in their mind th' Acrostick's threats they dread, And curse, denounc'd on their devoted head. Still I persist, and urge the hard command: With slow reluctant steps, they press the sand. In equal parts I strait divide the crew: Then in the urn the lots inscrib'd I threw, And shook the hallow'd vase, till chance decreed The sage Deidemon for the hardy deed: And join'd the brave Thaumastes to his side, By social love and like pursuits ally'd. Sheath'd in bright arms, o'er the suspected plain, Pensive they march, and pensive we remain. In vain th' enliv'ning banquet's charms we try, In vain the mirth-inspiring goblet ply. Dread and despair each rising joy controul, And horror, brooding o'er the sparkling bowl. Nor less in vain we seek the balm of sleep, For still the wretched painful vigils keep. Then first, my friends, I own, this manly breast Damp wav'ring doubt, fear's harbinger, confest. When, all-propitious to my raptur'd eyes, I saw Priapus' awful form arise; And thus the god: Dispel this causeless dread; For know, an hospitable land ye tread. What tho' the chiefs report a dreadful tale, Fearless do thou the glorious task assail. Nor war, nor hostile perils shalt thou prove: But the soft blandishments of proffer'd love. Myself the powerful passion will impart To the fond queen, and melt her yielding heart: Thy manly limbs with heighten'd charms I'll grace, And breathe resistless beauties o'er thy face: As artful sages give the modern stone Time's honour'd stains, and glories not its own; The canker'd coin with verdegris incrust, Or grace the polish'd bronze with reverend rust. With confidence proceed, my ready pow'r Shall never fail thee in th' important hour. He said, and vanish'd at th' approach of morn: When, lo! the chiefs with downcast look return. Aghast, with speechless tongue and bristling hair, Deidemon stood; an emblem of despair. Scarce could Thaumastes o'er his fears prevail: Who thus, at length, brought out the broken tale. We went, Scriblerus—(such was thy command) Thro' yon lone rocks to view this wond'rous land— Long had we roam'd—sudden a noise we heard Of mighty wings—and saw a monst'rous bird. I grasp'd my jav'lin, startled at th' alarm, But sage Deidemon stopt my desp'rate arm. Oh, well restrain'd! for, by its nearer flight, An human face, conspicuous to the sight, And human limbs appear'd.—With wild amaze, Astonish'd at the dire portent, we gaze, And meditate return—when, from the flood, (For near a spacious river's bank we stood) A bark emergent rose; with oars well-tim'd, Cut the smooth wave, and o'er the surface skim'd. Then sunk again, but still her course pursu'd, Clear was the stream, and all beneath we view'd. Swift we retire, with oft-retorted eye, Lest magick charms o'ertake us as we fly. Long unpursued we run, at length retreat Where an arch'd rock affords a welcome seat. Chearful we enter, but within behold A serpent shape with many a jointed fold. Each friendly pow'r invoking to my aid, The sleeping form, intrepid, I invade. Direct my faulchion on the monster's hide, And in the midst his bloodless frame divide. But soon, repentant, my rash deed deplore, For lo! two foes vindictive on the floor; Both rear the horned head, and both assail With the sharp terrors of the pois'nous tail. Again our trenchant blades aloft we heave, Dauntless again the sever'd bodies cleave, And triumph in the deed. Alas! how blind, How fond, how prone to err, the human mind! How vain our joy! for, (such the will of fate) Our conquests still new enemies create. Again th' unequal combat we renew, Again, surpriz'd, encrease the reptile crew. And now a numerous fry o'erspread the ground, By slaughter rais'd, and fertile from the wound. O! for that warning voice which Cadmus heard, When from the glebe his growing foes appear'd! Or the strong charms of Medea. Colchis' pow'rful maid, In like distress the valiant Jason's aid! A while retreating we maintain the fight, Then quit th' enchanted cave with sudden flight: And chear'd, th' auspicious land-marks to review, Thro' the known path, our glad return pursue. He ended, trembling: strait I grasp'd my sword, And bade them follow. At the dreadful word, Fear and confusion ev'ry breast invade; All join the desp'rate purpose to dissuade; But chief Thaumastes.—Hence; ignoble slave, Stern I reply, whose fears infect the brave. You, heroes once, inglorious, here remain, Aw'd by his words, a dastard, abject train. Alone I triumph, if my arms succeed, Or perish single in the hardy deed. Indignant thus, confiding in the god, O'er the drear plain, with haughty steps I strode. THE END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK III. ARGUMENT. A Priestess of Rumour relates to Scriblerus the history of the Queen of the country. He is struck with the beauties of an elegant temple, which he describes, as also the Queen's magnificent entry and her personal endowments. He makes himself known to her. She professes her regard for his family and for his own merits, to which she is no stranger: after which she invites him to a partnership of her bed and throne. Scriblerus consults with Albertus, and is advised by him to accede to her proposal of marriage: Saturn endeavours to deter him from it by fearful dreams and omens: notwithstanding which the marriage is celebrated, but the consummation prevented by the flight of two owls, which, added to the foregoing portents, intimidate the hero to that degree, that he resolves to fly from his beloved Queen. Her reproaches and entreaties prevail on him to return, but not till her unhappy impatience has impelled her to give herself a desperate wound, upon which Saturn cuts her fatal hair and she dies. Haply I stray'd, where midst the cavern'd cells Of vocal cliffs, fantastic Echo dwells. My way through serpent windings I pursu'd, Which deep within the hollow'd rocks were hew'd. The walls, inclining with an inward slope, End in a narrow groove and join at top. From side to side reverberate, they bear The quick vibrations of the trembling air; Hence weakest sounds the vaulted cavern shake, And whispers deaf'ning on the senses break. The cave of Rumour. O'er a spacious vent, With head reclin'd, her list'ning Priestess bent. (The Pythian thus imbib'd th' inspiring steam; Thus gave Trophonius the prophetic dream.) Swift from her seat, at my approach, she sprung, And thus she spake with more than mortal tongue. Thrice welcome, wand'rer, to this happy land, The work and glory of its Sov'reign's hand. Our Queen, with kind compassion, all receives, But the first honours to the stranger gives: Herself a stranger once, tho' here she reigns: A distant exile from her native plains. Northward as far beyond the torrid zone, Her husband held an indisputed throne. Till restless faction, big with murd'rous strife, Depriv'd th' unguarded monarch of his life. Dread and despair the drooping Queen affright: Grief wastes the day, and ghastly dreams the night. Before her eyes her husband stood confest; Rear'd his pale face, and bar'd his bleeding breast. At length advis'd her flight, but first reveal'd Where all his choicest treasures lay conceal'd. A chosen band the sacred stores convey O'er the rude waves; a woman leads the way. This isle she chose, her growing empire's seat; Here she enjoys an undisturb'd retreat: Here, where no pitchy keels pollute the sea, Nor restless commerce ploughs the wat'ry way. The Priestless thus my longing bosom fir'd— I left the tale unfinish'd and retir'd. Soon I descry'd where, near a cypress wood, A dome, upheld by stately columns, stood: Where brass and variegated marbles join Their mingled beams to grace the splendid shrine. Here glitt'ring ores their native charms unfold; There yellow mundic shines like burnish'd gold. Sulphurs and marcasites their beams display, And lucid crystals rival Titan's ray. Rang'd as a cornice, various fossils stand, The mimic sport of nature's wanton hand. Mitre and turban-forms the work adorn, Triton's huge trump, and Ammon's boasted horn. Here fibrous plants with many a branching vein, And there the curious texture of the brain. But how, O! how shall fancy's pow'r recall The forms that breath'd along the pictur'd wall! Where in Mosaic wrought, the shells surpass The pencil'd canvass or the sculptur'd brass. Dearest to nature first are seen a race Who bear the marks of her peculiar grace. Here griffons, harpies, dragons mix in flight, Here wild chimera rears her triple height. In glowing colours mighty Geryon stands, And bold Briareus wields his hundred hands. While thus my soul these empty shades possest, What sudden pangs invade my heedless breast! When, in blest shells of liveliest hue pourtray'd, I saw fair Lindamira's form display'd: I started at the sight: adown my cheek The swelling tears, in rapid torrents break: Then thus: What region in the world but knows My hapless passion and illustrious woes? Lo! as in life, the dear sad object stands, And makes my suff'rings known in distant lands— When sudden, ent'ring at the lofty gate, The Queen herself approach'd in solemn state. Her head th' inextricable Plica grac'd: Whose folds descending, veil'd her beauteous waist, Then length'ning downwards, form'd a regal train, And swept, with awful majesty, the plain. On her fair front a goodly horn she bore: But nor the crown or gay tiara wore. Frequent and thick, o'er all her limbs were seen Th' elongated papillæ of the skin. Graceful excrescence of resplendent horn, Like the shagg'd velvet, or the new-reap'd corn. Never but once beheld I, till that hour, Such finish'd charms. I gaze and I adore. She mounts the throne, and hearing ev'ry cause, Directs her judgment by great Nature's laws. Where nice distinction doubtful claims divides, Duly she weighs, impartial she decides. To her the vegetable kingdom owes A sure protection from invading foes, Who oft the sprouting coral strive to gain, And earth-born mandrake, from its rightful reign. Now solemn heralds led me to the throne, And bade my nation and my name make known. Thus, to the monarch, I my speech addrest: O! foremost still to succour the distrest, From northern isles, from a far distant strand, By adverse winds, I tread this pleasing land. Behold Scriblerus, no ignoble name; (Earth sounds my wisdom, and high heaven my fame.) Now a sad fugitive, and tempest-tost, Driv'n with confusion, from each neighbour coast, O! grant the refuge of thy friendly shores: Supply with bounteous hand our wasted stores: Else rashly we attempt th' unmeasur'd way, And death awaits us on the barren sea. Elate with pleasure, stagger'd with surprize, So wills the mindful god, the Queen replies, Are you the great Scriblerus, dear to fame, Who, from high Pliny trac'd, your lineage claim? The same whom learned Barthius' daughter bore To fam'd Cornelius on the British shore? I lov'd old Gaspar; greatly lov'd thy sire: Nor less thy virtues, courteous guest, admire. Accept that name; and, if thou not disdain, Friend to my soul and partner of my reign. Then I. Ah! cease, too gen'rous, to o'erpow'r Thine humblest slave with all thy bounty's store. Such godlike blessings from so fair a hand, Eternal praise and gratitude demand. While on earth's surface fruits and flowrets blow And fossils vegetate in beds below, In coral polypes haunt, in snow the bear, Whales sport in seas, and eels in vinegar, While bright volcanos spout eternal flame, So long shall last the glories of thy name. I said,—the gracious monarch instant sends The wish'd refection to my dubious friends: But from their longing arms their chief detains, And strives to bind with love's resistless chains. At her desire the series I relate Of my long wand'ring and disast'rous fate. Deep sunk my suff'rings in her yielding heart, Transpierc'd with love's inevitable dart, And fix'd as some impal'd and helpless fly, Who bleeds a victim to the optician's eye, Before his glass spins in repeated round, And strives to flutter from the deadly wound: Firm and unmov'd the speculative sage Eyes the vain efforts of its insect rage. Soon as the morn dispens'd her earliest ray, Strait to the shore I urg'd my speedy way. Dissolv'd in tears my anxious friends I found, The untouch'd cates neglected on the ground. As when some ass (hir'd haply to repair The riot-wasted rake or love-sick fair) From her fond young, the tedious morning strays, Driv'n thro' some pop'lous city's crouded ways; Her absence, pent in dismal cots, they mourn: But wild with rapture, at her blest return, They leap, they bound, their braying fills the plain, And the glad hills repeat the harmonious strain. So round me prest, now rescued from despair, Th' exulting crew, my fortunes I declare. The welcome stores they to the bark convey: Then chearful follow where I lead the way. Soon as we reach'd the dome, the Queen invites To the spread feast and hospitable rites. Again she asks to hear the moving tale, Again big tears her melting heart reveal. Now all to rest retire: but sleep denies His balmy blessings to my anxious eyes. Long ere the sun had left his eastern goal, Thus to Alburtus I disclose my soul. Seest thou, with eyes like mine, this matchless Queen, Her rare endowments, her majestic mein? With ev'ry virtue, ev'ry grace is join'd, And as her form, prodigious is her mind. What gen'rous proffers has her bounty made, Of half her throne and half her blissful bed! Yes, I confess, since Lindamira's love, No other charms, like these my breast could move: The same their merits, my desire the same: I feel rekindling all my former flame. Were I not bound by ev'ry sacred vow, Never again at Hymen's shrine to bow, Perhaps her peerless beauties might controul The weak resolves of my unstable soul.— While my rack'd breast these struggling tumults shook, Thus on my speech the kind Albertus broke; Say, will you still a joyless wanderer rove, And never taste the soft delights of love? Nor in your offspring glad th' astonish'd earth, The happy parent of a wond'rous birth? And sure, no less shall grace your nuptial bed, For can aught vulgar from the Queen proceed? Wisely, I grant, you shunn'd the weak alarms Of common beauty and quotidian charms; But O! imprudent, should you now disclaim A pleasing passion and auspicious flame. With mutual warmth, her proffer'd love receive, And taste the joys her heavenly beauties give. While thus his pleasing counsel he addrest, Alas! too grateful to my love-sick breast! Sudden aloud the good Albertus sneez'd: I yield, and follow with the omen pleas'd. The monarch now her learned treasures shows, And pleas'd each mystic science to disclose, Illustrates by what powers huge vessels glide, Conceal'd beneath the surface of the tide. How, by her arts, her subjects learn to rise On silken wings, and cut the liquid skies. Or, to the winds, in cars of lightest cane, Spread the broad sail, and swiftly skim the plain. Much I applaud, for much I all admire. Thus mutual pleasures fan our growing fire. As when in vinegar, at distance plac'd, To join two self-mov'd Astroites haste; Our heaving hearts, with fond impatience, move, And pant for contact, with attractive love. Nor can our eager passion brook delay, We, for our spousals, name th' ensuing day. How shall my tongue the sad reverse of fate, And terrors of the dreadful night relate? Oft rose fair Lindamira's frowning shade: My purpose oft with boding voice forbade. So Julia menac'd round her Pompey's bed, Ere Cæsar conquer'd, and Pharsalia bled. With her, my swarthy rival blasts my sight, And casts a blacker horror on the night. Th' assembled lawyers next (tremendous band) Rose to my view, and all my soul unman'd. But chief, O! chief! the Queen herself opprest, And, with dire om'nous action, chill'd my breast. Stern she approach'd, and, with contemptuous look, The horn opprobrious from her forehead took And fix'd on mine: when, sudden o'er my head, Portentous growth! luxuriant antlers spread. Wide and more wide the teeming branches shoot, And ceaseless suckers issue from the root. Such ghastly visions waste the dismal night: I rose, dejected, with the morning light. The sun I sought: behind a murky cloud, Shorn of his beams, he dimly frown'd in blood, And now, already at my gate was seen An early herald from th' impatient Queen. Dissembling, I suppress the rising tear, And strive th' unprosp'rous moments to defer. In vain: already at the altar stands Th' officious priest to join our hapless hands. Oh sad effects of too neglectful haste! No hymeneal rites our nuptials grac'd. No hallow'd priest the festal victim slew, And the curs'd gall behind the altar threw. Nor did the slaves the flaming torches bear, Nor burn the axle of the bridal car; With flow'rs or woolly fillets deck the door, Or figs, the type of future plenty, pour; Nor wild asparagus at once imply'd The courtship and possession of the bride; No sportive songsters hail'd the genial time, Chaunting the fescennine licentious rhime. Nor did the bride the solemn barley bear, Nor with the spear divide her flowing hair, Or yellow veil of mystic purport wear. No matron's voice her eager steps forbad The sacred threshold of the porch to tread. No decent zone secur'd her looser waist, But ev'ry rite was lost in shameless haste! Hymen his sacred influence withdraws, And sees, with anger, his neglected laws. Soon as within the sacred fane I came, Sudden, extinguish'd, sunk the hallow'd flame. Ghosts howling, sadden the long isle's dark gloom, And sweats of blood distil from ev'ry tomb. To wait a more propitious hour, I move; But she o'er-rules my fears with eager love. Th' obedient priests dispatch with trembling haste, Thence move, with pomp, to grace the nuptial feast. The bride, transported, smiles with open soul, Gay from the feast, and wanton from the bowl; To her lov'd grot, with fond desire, invites, There to consummate Hymen's blissful rites. Deep in the dark recesses of the wood A cave obscur'd with gloomy laurels stood. Ivy, within, the verdant roof o'erspread With pendant foliage, a luxuriant shade! The ruin'd walls the monarch's hand adorns With mould'ring stones, rough moss, and broken urns. O'er these, with studied negligence, she spreads Strange roots, gay garlands, and fantastic weeds. Rough unhewn steps lead to the dark retreat, And a vast mat presents an ample seat. This grot she destin'd for the nuptial night, Sacred to love and conscious of delight. Unstable state of wretched human kind! Faithless as seas, and fickle as the wind: The gentlest blast may nip our blooming joy: The slightest wave our baseless bliss destroy. Our fleeting pleasure no duration knows, But ebbs, ere well we can perceive it flows. Now, happiest pair, we reach th' auspicious bow'r, Big with the transports of the genial hour; When lo! two owls, who, with the like design, Retir'd, in silence, to the secret shrine; Rush forth, with loud complainings, from the cave, And, with sad sighs, their loves unfinish'd leave. Saturn, to thwart my rising joys intent, The boding augury, terrific, sent; He, with foul dreams, my trembling bosom chill'd And all my soul with deadly horror fill'd. Hence, at the last portent, with wild affright, From the fond Queen I wing my speedy flight. And, urg'd with shame, not knowing how to bear Her just reproach for my dishonest fear, Strait to the ready crew I give the word, And summon all with swiftest speed on board. Aurora now had left Tithonus' bed: When to the shore by fatal fury led, The monarch hastes; the parting bark she view'd, And thus, with scoffs, my coward flight pursu'd. Unmanly traitor, whom nor honor awes, Nor sacred gratitude's eternal laws; Vaunt not thyself from great Scriblerus sprung; Thy coward soul belies thy boastful tongue. Thee not the learned Barthius' daughter bore, Bred 'midst the rocks of Scotia's barren shore, The lifeless offspring of her blasted trees, Nurs'd, as brought forth, amidst thy kindred geese. Ah whither do my various passions rove? Still must I censure whom I still must love? How could'st thou, cruel, from thy consort run, The sacred rites of Hymen but begun? Scorn'd and neglected leave the nuptial bed, And all the mighty debt of love unpaid? Oh! had you but bestow'd one fond embrace, Ere yet you fled from this once valued face; Perhaps I had not then despair'd to see Some young Scriblerus, heav'nly fair, like thee. If fate, reluctant to compleat my joy, Denied the blessing of a sprightly boy, Some embrio semblance of thy form divine, At least had floated in the glassy shrine. Fond flatt'ring hope possession had supply'd, Nor had you left me so forlorn a bride. Fir'd at that sacred name, again contest The jarring passions in my bleeding breast. The friendless vagrant, not content to save, Rare arts I taught, and choicest presents gave; Not ev'n ourself with-held, but fondly led The coward boaster to my bridal bed— Now signs are seen—now Saturn omens sends— And visions bode, and augury portends— Such cares, forsooth, disturb the peaceful fowl, And to distress poor lovers flies the owl. If ere futurity by signs was known, To me some omen had thy baseness shown; Victims had wanted ev'ry nobler part, And, to denote thee truly, chief the heart. Her rueful moanings my compassion move, And to my breast recall affrighted love. I feel his dictates o'er my fears prevail, And call to change our course and shift the sail. But oh! I scarce had giv'n the tardy word, Ere her rash hand her bleeding bosom gor'd. Shock'd at the dreadful sight, ply ev'ry oar, Eager, I cry, and instant make the shore— Rous'd by my well-known voice, again revive Her drooping spirits, and she strives to live. When lo! vindictive Saturn reach'd the strand, And seiz'd the Plica with relentless hand. Then wav'd aloft his glitt'ring scythe in air, And cropt, for ever cropt, the fatal hair. A deathful slumber clos'd her beauteous eyes: And her freed soul regain'd her native skies. THE END OF THE THIRD BOOK. BOOK IV. ARGUMENT. The Queen appearing to Scriblerus, as he lies in a swoon, informs him that all his misfortunes are owing to the murder of the Acrostick, for whose death he must make atonement, and celebrate games to his memory. The hero returns to the violated island, and submissively sues for peace. Then follow the games. Scriblerus establishes a lasting friendship with the islanders, and retires loaded with presents. He pursues his course up the Red Sea, and travels over the desart to Cairo. He briefly touches his journey from thence in quest of the petrified city, and concludes with his affliction for the loss of his treasures. The pilgrims condoling with him thereon, are interrupted by an omen which they interpret in his favour; then praying for his success, and presenting him with the most valuable of their treasures, they depart. My shudd'ring frame, unnerv'd with horror, sunk Extended on the deck a lifeless trunk. My soul uncumber'd with corporeal ties, At large thro' fancy's boundless empire flies, Full in my sight the Queen's lov'd form appears, Awakes reflexion, and renews my tears. But soon her voice my rising griefs forbad, And thus began the visionary shade. I come not fondly to upbraid, but show The fatal origin of all thy woe, And to direct its cure. From one rash deed, Th' Acrostick's murder, all thy woes proceed. Then seek with speed the violated coast; With sacrifice appease his injur'd ghost. Games and lustrations must avert thy doom, And rites exequial grace his honour'd tomb. Yet, ere from hence the parting sail you spread Be one sad office to my mem'ry paid. In yon lone grove's remotest corner stands A structure, rais'd by these ill fated hands. Huge intermingling fibrous roots, dispos'd With curious art, a pyramid composed. Bones lin'd the walls, in rustick order placed: The gloomy roof the smoak of tapers graced: Skulls grinn'd around, and ashes lay beneath: The bow'r of contemplation and of death. Here as I sat and moan'd my widow'd love With tears, my hapless hands Asbestus wove, And form'd a shroud. To this my corse intrust, And save my ashes from the vulgar dust: While quick-consuming flames at once devour My poor remains, and death-devoted bower. With marble then the pyramid replace; And let my bones inurn'd the summit grace. With sighs she ended. Thrice in vain I strove To clasp the fleeting object of my love. She flies my grasp unfelt, as shadows pass, Or hands protruded from the concave glass. Obedient to the visionary fair, Her obsequies employ our pious care. The pile consum'd, with marble we replace, And with her bones inurn'd the summit grace. Then naked run, in frantick courses, round Th' anointed tomb with flow'rs and chaplets crown'd. Such mystick rites to great Pelides' shade, On Xanthus' banks, Æmathia's hero paid. With prosp'rous winds we sail. The joyful crew Transported hail the wish'd-for shores in view. Strait we select a venerable band; The peaceful olive waves in every hand. Onward they march, and to the chiefs explain Our deep contrition for th' Acrostick slain: And sue for peace. The bards accept our love With mutual zeal, and to the temple move To ratify their vows. An awful shrine! Sacred to Phœbus; where at once combine Whate'er of splendor, beauty, grace, or art, The most exalted fancy can impart. Nor yields this pile to that celestial fane, The work of Vulcan, in th' ætherial plain. Within the dome, in lofty niches stood Six statues carv'd of cedar's od'rous wood. The sacred band great Triphiodorus leads; High o'er the baffled alphabet he treads. Next him th' intrepid Chœrilus appears; His boastful hand the royal bounty bears. Elate with ancient praise, old Bavius sits There Leoninus, first of modern wits. On the proud elephant, in triumph, thron'd, Querno, with Rome's imperial laurel crown'd, Shakes his anointed head, in act to speak, While tears of joy run trickling down his cheek. The next, a lofty poetess was seen; Beauteous her face, majestic was her mien. Severe reward of pride! that lovely form No more thy transmigrated soul shall warm; Chang'd to a bird, for ever doom'd to fly With party-colour'd plumes, a chatt'ring pye. Soon as I tread the temple's sacred floor, The laurel shakes, the hollow caverns roar: Bedew'd with sweat, each awful image stood, And big round drops fell from the hallow'd wood. The vulgar tremble, and would quit the fane, But the skill'd seer pronounc'd their terrors vain. No threaten'd ills these boding signs portend: The great Scriblerus comes your dearest friend. A copious subject for your labour'd song, To tire each hand, and weary ev'ry tongue: Th' extensive theme his glorious deeds afford, Shall sweat six well-breath'd poets to record. He said: and bade them ply the genial feast. Thence, sated, all retire to needful rest. Soon as Aurora's beams disperse the gloom, The pious croud surround th' Acrostick's tomb: With solemn pomp begin the rites divine, Pouring the tepid milk and sparkling wine, And consecrated flour—when, round the grave, Strange to relate, the ground was seen to heave. A batten'd mole arises midst the heaps Of crumbled earth, and to the viands creeps: Around he strays, the rich libation sips, And tastes the sacred flour with harmless lips. Thus fed with holy food, the wond'rous guest Within the hollow tomb retires to rest. Then I: Suspect no more, thrice-honor'd train, Our vows rejected, or lustration vain. See the familiar of th' industrious dead, Propitious omen, on our off'rings fed! Or shall we deem him genius of the place, By Phœbus sent our festal pomp to grace? Yon sloping hill's umbrageous side commands The spacious ocean and the level sands: The living marble there shall yield a seat, While solemn games the hallow'd rites compleat. Thither the prizes bring ordain'd to grace The rapid victor in th' ærial race. Before the rest an ox majestic stalks: Six monstrous legs support him as he walks. On his bold front he rolls three glaring eyes, And twice ten vulgar oxen was his price. Deidemon next conducted to the shore A female captive valued but at four. To her, Machaon, all thy arts were known, To strain the bandage, or replace the bone. My swelling heart unable to restrain, I rose, and thus addrest the list'ning train. Behold yon matchless beast ordain'd to grace, The rapid victor in th' ærial race. None from ourself that prize should bear away; But not for triumph is this mournful day. Far other thoughts my sorrowing hours employ, And sad contrition holds the place of joy. Let brisker youths their active nerves prepare, Fit their light silken wings, and skim the buxom air. Mov'd by my words, two youths of equal fire Spring from the croud, and to the prize aspire. The one a German of distinguish'd fame: His rival from projecting Britain came. They spread their wings, and with a rising bound, Swift at the word together quit the ground. The Briton's rapid flight outstrips the wind: The lab'ring German urges close behind. As some light bark, pursu'd by ships of force, Stretches each sail to swell her swifter course, The nimble Briton from his rival flies, And soars on bolder pinions to the skies. Sudden the string, which bound his plumage, broke; His naked arms in yielding air he shook: His naked arms no more support his weight, But fail him sinking from his airy height. Yet as he falls, so chance or fate decreed, His rival near him urg'd his winged speed, Not unobserv'd. (despair suggests a thought) Fast by the foot the heedless youth he caught, And drew th' insulting victor to the ground: While rocks and woods with loud applause resound. Then I: Behold yon matchless youth compell'd By fortune, not superior skill to yield His juster glories in the well-flown field. But not unhonor'd shall he halt away, Or giftless mourn this unauspicious day. Yon damsel, for the present, suits not ill: For much, alas! he wants her ablest skill; And to his tent, ere morning, shall be brought, A statue of resplendent metals wrought; Where Icarus his silver wings expands, And boasts the labour of his father's hands. Now for those chiefs who cut their calmer way Beneath the boist'rous surface of the sea, From the tall bark the rich rewards are born: And first was seen great Ammon's twisted horn, By nature's hand exprest in massive stone: Twice six stout porters with the burthen groan. Rich Surinam produc'd the second prize; A toad prolific, of enormous size. High on her pregnant back her young are born, (Her pregnant back with frequent labour torn) Thro' her burst skin they force their painful way, And issue a portentous birth, to-day. To grace the third, a flowing robe was brought: Of spider's web the curious texture wrought. First, great Agrippa to the prize pretends: From learn'd Cornelius' lineage he descends. His skilful hand the speedy mermaid guides Safe from tempestuous winds and thwarting tides. Next, long-inur'd beneath the waves to dwell, The two descendants of the great Drebell. One guides the Crocodile's stupendous size; Six banks of oars, in six degrees, arise: The other in the lighter Hydra flies, Far in the sea a grove of coral stood, The waves o'ershadowing with a branching wood. To this, their destin'd goal, they urge their flight, And, at the stated signal, sink from sight; Their oars now move with wide-expanded sweep, And now return contracted thro' the deep. The Hydra leads: Drebell, elate of soul, His rivals eyes, regardless of the goal: With fond assurance deems the prize his own; And oft in thought he weighs the pond'rous stone. O justest picture of the human mind, Rash tho' unknowing, confident tho' blind. Plung'd in the depths of error, we decree: Boldly we judge of what we dimly see; And, too impatient for Truth's sober pace, We follow light-wing'd hope's delusive chace. Some air-drawn phantom leads our eyes astray, Blind to the nearer rocks which choak our dang'rous way. Thus wrapt in thought, the Chief incautious drove His vessel's side against th' entangling grove. The branching coral snapt th' extended oars, And the rash youth his vanish'd hopes deplores. And now the wretch beholds, with jealous eyes, The Mermaid next advancing for the prize. Fraternal love a treach'rous thought inspires, He loads his engines with the Grecian fires: And, as the rival barge triumphant past, Against her sides the fierce bitumen cast. Wide rage the fires. The crew with hasty care, The raw bull-hides and vinegar prepare To damp the flames, and quit the needful oar: Swift flies the well-row'd Crocodile before, Sweeps circling round the grove and makes the shore. Now, her defrauded honors to regain, The Mermaid plies her oars, but plies in vain. Too well the fraudful brother's arts prevail; Applauding shouts her conqu'ring rival hail. At length the young Drebellides returns, Tho' half her oars the crippled Hydra mourns. As when the hungry Crab in India's main, Whose body two unequal legs sustain, Intent some oyster's op'ning shell to spoil, Moves to the gaping prey with aukward toil; His larger claw, with treach'rous pebbles load, Drives him obliquely sideling from the road; The Hydra thus, impell'd by partial force, Steer'd thro' the waves her lame and tardy course. Once more, I thus bespoke th' attentive train; Advance the skilful marksmen on the plain, Who, with the air's comprest elastic force, From wind-guns speed the bullet's rapid course. High on the summit of yon lofty hill, The milk-white courser by the sculptor's skill, Vast as the Trojan horse, conspicuous stands, And speaks the labor of no vulgar hands. Who smite the steed shall share one gen'ral prize, This radiant store of matchless butterflies. But he whose happier ball with nicer aim Shall strike the flank, the victor's glory claim; For, on the flank, Laocoon's furious dart Pierc'd the vast structure of Epeus' art. Be his reward this valued volume, fraught With all the stores of Wor'ster's pregnant thought. I said: and in the hallow'd helmet threw The lots inscrib'd; the first Deidemon drew. His well-aimed engine he directs with care, And instant frees the close-imprison'd air. Th' unerring ball pursu'd its rapid course, And smote, with furious stroke, the sacred horse. By strong repulsion, thence return'd, again Roll'd back and lay, conspicuous, on the plain. The rest, by turns, succeed their art to try, And wing the pond'rous metal thro' the sky: With like amaze the prodigy repeat, And find the fatal bullet at their feet. Mov'd by the impulse of some power divine, I now resolve the solemn games to join. When lo! a stranger omen greets our eyes, And fills the gazer's soul with new surprize; As thro' the air I drove the whizzing lead, An ambient flame around the metal spread: Such and so bright yon argent circles glow, Which ceaseless round the orb of Saturn flow; High o'er the rock, metereous, it flies, Borne unextinguish'd to the lofty skies. Then thus the bards explain the great portent: To thee, Scriblerus, is this omen sent; By this unerring sign the Gods decree Peaceful return to all thy friends: to Thee, Successive scenes of wonder to explore In realms far distant from thy native shore. Fix'd and suspended for a while I stand: At length approaching the prophetic band; Perplex'd, I spake: within my dubious soul, Hope and distrust, by turns, tumultuous roll. Blest be the seer whose hallow'd tongue imparts These sounds of comfort to our dubious hearts; Yet tho' each omen point a prosp'rous end, Still o'er our heads th' Acrostick's threats impend: O! teach us by what sacrifice or pray'r T' avert the curse, or bravely how to bear: And, if so far thy science reach, relate What distant realms my future toil await. The seer replies: suffice it that you know (For Saturn's wrath forbids the rest to show) A prosp'rous end to all your woes decreed; Then, spight of boding prophecies, proceed. Such threats, nor fear to meet, nor wish to shun, Perhaps the menace of an empty pun. Well has thy care appeas'd th' Acrostick's soul No doubt remains thy purpose to controul; With speed to Egypt's sacred coast repair; There shall a surer oracle declare Thy future course; yet ere thou hence depart, Receive these tokens of a friendly heart. He said, and twelve resplendent Axes brought; Twelve choice Ænigmas on the steel were wrought. A shepherd's Pipe, whose each decreasing line Resounds the honours of the tuneful Nine. Then march six Bards, who, studious to rehearse Our deathless labours in Pindaric verse, Bear them, inscrib'd on six expanded wings, And each, in turn, th' unequal measure sings. Then joining hands, ere yet I thence withdrew, In words like these I paid my last adieu; May Phœbus ever bless this peaceful land; To endless time your letter'd altars stand; Still may your groves their radiant fruits unfold; Still bloom with sparkling gems and burnish'd gold: May music flow from ev'ry Naiad's urn, And echoing rocks the melting sounds return. Nor Critic pow'rs invade this blest retreat, To bruise your flow'rets with their hostile feet. And now confirm'd our vows of mutual love; From the gay coast, with mournful steps, we move. Six tedious weeks we spread the swelling sails, And drive at large before the southern gales. When, from Arabia's spicy borders, spring The Eastern breezes, and with od'rous wing, Fanning the wanton air, around dispense A grateful fragrance to the ravish'd sense. The Erythræan sea before us lay Our destin'd course: a far-extended bay. In twice ten days, the inmost coast we reach, And land our treasures on the spacious beach. To camels now consign the precious load, And toil, intrepid, thro' the pathless road: The fifteenth sultry morn's auspicious light Reveal'd great Cairo's minarets to sight. From thence we journey'd o'er the desart plain: There all my treasures, solace of my pain, Sav'd through a thousand toils, but sav'd in vain, Perish'd at once. This stroke no boding sign Foretold: nor did the dire Acrostic join Amidst his ruthless curses: this surpast All other woes: the greatest and the last. Abrupt the Hero ends the wond'rous tale; While tears in torrents o'er his words prevail. When, rushing from the sky, the bird of Jove A team of twenty ducks before him drove: With trembling wing, beneath the flood they shoot, The whelming waves elude his vain pursuit. Ruffled with rage, th' indignant tyrant glows: 'Till from the stream a pamper'd goose arose. Eager to her he wings his deathful way, And his strong talons seize the goodly prey. With friendly joys thus spake the pious train: Not hard this mystic omen to explain As yon proud bird indignant grief exprest, With wild disorder'd flight and ruffled crest, Or wheeling thro' the wide ætherial way, Or vainly hov'ring o'er his vanish'd prey; Now rais'd on sounding pinions seeks the skies, At length successful in a nobler prize: So shall thou meet thy rich reward at last, And lose in present joys thy suff'rings past. But O! for us what promised boon remains, What gleam of hope for all our endless pains? With these bare feet, in vain, yon hallow'd ground Whole years we trod: no precious relic found: No blest remains of better days could trace 'Midst impious Ottoman's usurping race; Where barb'rous rage the sainted forms devours, Foe to the chizzel's consecrating pow'rs. While listless drones the Pontiff's chair degrade, And zeal no more awakens the Crusade. They said, and from the bark a plenteous store Of strong Asphaltos to the Hero bore. And twelve fair apples beauteous to behold, Whose rind refulgent vies with burnish'd gold. But, for the fruit, a nauseous pulp is found, Or ashes fill the vain delusive round. These gifts the Chief receives with grateful hand, And to proud Cairo leads the wearied band. He venerates the Soldan's ruin'd state, And burns to find the Prophet of his fate. THE END OF THE FOURTH BOOK. BOOK V. ARGUMENT. Scriblerus, having consulted the Morosoph, relates to his friends the result of his enquiry. That he must leave them to go in search of the philosopher's stone, which is promis'd him. That they must return to England and found a society, of which he is to be visitor; and being assured, by possession of the stone, of longævity, if not immortality, he promises to visit the society every century. After a variety of hardships which our Hero undergoes in twelve months travel from Genoa, where his friends leave him, he arrives at a grove near Munster in Germany. In this city, after several fruitless attempts to transmute lead into gold, the alchymists agree to postpone the farther trial of their art to the next day, hoping it might be more auspicious, as being the first day of April, the birth-day of that successful alchymist Basilius Valentinus. That night Plutus appears to the Hero, and directs him to the fatal root which is to procure the transmutation of metals and prolongation of life. Inspired with gratitude and devotion, Scriblerus sacrifices a goose and thirty goslins, which engages him in a sharp conflict with a revengeful maiden, whom at length he vanquishes, and, with a moderation singular in a conqueror, leaves, to pursue his journey to Munster. All night, the sleepless sage impatient lay, Big with the fortunes of the following day. Soon as the wish'd-for morn with purple streaks Th' horizon's utmost bound, Scriblerus seeks The raptur'd seer. A long successless day Thro' every street he takes his tiresome way. The night approach'd: when, seated on the ground, Alone, the pensive Morosoph he found. A woolly sheepskin veil'd his rev'rend head: Thence lengthen'd downwards and beneath him spread. (Thus, near Albunea's hallow'd fount, repos'd On fleecy skins, the priest of Faunus doz'd) But all before, his sacred body bare, Ill-brook'd the rigour of th' inclement air. A deep capacious bowl, replete with store Of potent opium in his hand he bore. So fam'd Theangelis with hallow'd rage Fills the swoll'n bosom of the Persian mage. The scratching-stick with which the Seer subdu'd The tingling tumults of his boiling blood, Seem'd, as he whirl'd it, the Chaldean rod, Or Thyrsus, symbol of the Lybian god. Scriblerus now approach'd with rev'rence low, The Seer observ'd; and dealt a furious blow Full on his head: whose force impetuous stunn'd Th' unwary sage, and fell'd him to the ground. Frantic awhile with ideot grin he gaz'd; At length the Hero from the earth he rais'd: Then to his lips convey'd the balmy draught; The senseless Chief the slumb'rous potion quaft. His heavy eyes the slumb'rous potion clos'd, Ere yet his tongue his various doubts propos'd. Wrapt in th' embrace of sleep, he past the night, And rising, joyful, with the morning light, His friends he sought, impatient to relate Their glories promis'd by propitious fate. Eager alike his dear companions ran To meet their chief; Scriblerus thus began. Hear, blest associates of my various pains, What rich reward to crown our toil remains. Last night, so Jove ordain'd, alone I found The heav'n-taught Prophet seated on the ground. An hallow'd rage already had possest His raptured soul, and heav'd his swelling breast. High on his head uprose the bristling hair: His turgid eye-balls roll'd an hideous glare; With chatt'ring teeth, the working foam he churn'd, And thrice the solid earth, impatient, spurn'd; Then, wildly starting, danced with frantic bounds, Whirling his rapid head in giddy rounds: He wav'd th' Edonian Thyrsus in his hand, And look'd a priest of Bacchus' furious band. In admiration lost, awhile I wait Till the first efforts of his rage abate: When by his arm the Thyrsus urged around, Full on my temples gave this goary wound. Prostrate I lay. At length the pitying sage, Calm'd and recover'd from his holy rage, With friendly steps advancing, seiz'd my hand: Chear'd with his voice and raised me from the sand; Then with Nepenthes crown'd a mantling bowl, Whose sov'reign charms restored my drooping soul. Thus Helen mix'd the mirth-inspiring draught; From these rich shores the virtuous drugs she brought. My spirits soon reviving in my breast, I thus the hallow'd Morosoph addrest: Illustrious Seer, whose all-enlighten'd eyes Dart thro' the distant regions of the skies: To thee an earnest suppliant am I come, To hear thy dictates and enquire my doom. The raptured Seer his rev'rend tresses shakes, Then, fill'd with sacred inspiration, speaks. Heav'n-favour'd Sage, to whom the fates allow Those secrets wrapt from vulgar minds, to know. Hear with a grateful and attentive heart, The precepts which thy kinder stars impart. First, in obedience to their high decree, Again embarking on a length of sea, Fair Genoa seek: there quit thy mournful friends, But learn what fortune their return attends. I see, I see them spread their swelling sails: Some fav'ring pow'r supplies the friendly gales. I see fair Albion's tow'ring cliffs arise, While to the wish'd-for port the vessel flies. Now, now, behold, their hopes successful crown'd, With wisest laws an infant state they found— See how her sons with gen'rous ardour strive, Bid ev'ry long-lost Gothic art revive. Each British science studiously explore: Their dress, their building, and their coins restore.— Be these your arts. Proceed, illustrious race, And yon fair isle with ancient glories grace. Let others view with astronomic eyes, Yon lucid vagrants in the peopled skies: Let them the habitable dome design, Taught by Vitruvius, or old Euclid's line; Carve the rough block, inform the lumpish mass, Give canvas life, and mould the breathing brass; With storied emblems, stamp th' historic coin; The painter's skill and poet's fancy join: Be yours the task, industrious, to recal The lost inscription to the ruin'd wall; Each Celtic character explain; or shew How Britons ate a thousand years ago: On laws of jousts and tournaments declaim, Or shine the rivals of the herald's fame. But chief the Saxon wisdom be your care, Preserve their idols, and their fanes repair; The cold devotion of the moderns warm With Friga's fair hermaphroditic form: And may their deep mythology be shown By Seater's wheel and Thor's tremendous throne. Thus far the Sage by sacred raptures born, Reveals the fame of ages yet unborn. He paused and fix'd his eyes as tho' he view'd Those glories present, then his speech renew'd: Such honour crowns thy dear companions fates; Superior far thy glorious self awaits. The grand elixir art thou doom'd to know: But first must roam a mendicant in show; Naked and pennyless thro' distant lands, And eat thy bread the alms of stranger hands. The rugged Alps must those bare feet assail, Froz'n on the hill, or swelt'ring in the vale; Scorn and contempt thy painful lot remain, Till Munster's venerable walls thou gain. Munster the destin'd period of thy woe: There, on a lake, white as the new-fall'n snow, A goose, majestic, o'er the waves shall ride, And thirty milk-white goslins by her side. Nigh to the borders of the silver flood, Sacred to Plutus, stands a lofty wood, Beneath its shadowing branches, grows a flow'r Whose root the god endues with wondrous pow'r; Not the famed Moly which great Hermes bore To sage Ulysses on th' Ææan shore; Nor that restorative the Tartar boasts, Nor all the growth of Arab's blissful coasts, Nor balsams which from northern trees transpire, Tho' six successive months th' ætherial fire With constant rays the balmy juice sublime, Can match this offspring of the German clime. What tho' no radiant metal grace the rind, No golden branches crackle to the wind; What tho' it seem (so Plutus has decreed) To vulgar eyes, a despicable weed: Yet from this herb, a thousand virtues flow; This pow'rful antidote for every woe. Nor meagre sickness, nor consuming care, Shall waste thy vigour with intestine war. Tho' age thy wither'd front with wrinkles plough, And blanch the hoary honours of thy brow; Tho' sanguine gamesters bett against thy life, Thou unconcern'd shalt hear the wagering strife. From this inestimable root calcined, The great hermetic secret shalt thou find; On baser ores the pow'rful ashes strow; And purest gold shall from the furnace flow. If fav'ring Plutus, bounteous pow'r, ordain That thou, Scriblerus, the high prize obtain, A sudden radiance of cœlestial light Shall guide thy footsteps, and direct thy sight: But if the god the precious gift with-hold Averse, nor deem thee worthy of the gold, Fruitless and vain thy weary search is made: The plant lies buried in eternal shade. If e'er thou swerve from rigid virtue's path, Expect the vengeful god's severest wrath. The root its virtue shall retain no more: Like Midas thou the useless gift deplore. Let humble thoughts thy vanity controul, And meekness temper thine elated soul. Pride rears her giant form aloft and treads Injurious o'er the cow'ring gazers heads. By pride obnoxious, jealousy and hate Shall drive thee skulking from each envious state. But lowly charity's unheeded pace Nor envy spies, nor can suspicion trace. Then chief be heaven-born charity thy care, Nor pass one hour without a grateful pray'r. Thus far the Seer, when sleep's resistless god Shook o'er my eye-lids his Lethæan rod. At morn I waked, astonish'd and alone, For ah! the prophet from my side was gone. Thus to his gladden'd friends the Chief relates The tale prophetic of their future fates. Elate with hope a vessel they prepare And load the needful stores with zealous care. With prosp'rous gales they cut the liquid way, And moor secure in Genoa's destined bay. There, drown'd in tears and dumb with friendly grief, His sad companious leave their mournful Chief; Yet as the Hero bids his last adieu, He vows, ere long, their growing schemes to view, And, each revolving cent'ry, to repeat His solemn visit to their foster state. Tho' Portugal her lost Sebastian mourn, And weary heav'n in vain for his return: On surer prophecies you build your faith; Nor part I hence to exile or to death, Like Regulus amidst th' opposing fears Of friends, of kindred, and the senate's tears; Nor like Lycurgus, in his country's cause, His life devoting to enforce his laws. Nor shall your Chief a baffled wretch return, An outcast loaded with reproach and scorn; But rich in glories, honour'd and adored, And more than mortal, to your arms restored. He said, and pensive prest the sounding shore, While the waves foam beneath their brushing oar. Twelve tedious months, with painful steps and slow, Thro' a long series of opprobrious woe, Naked and pennyless, in unknown lands, He ate his bitter bread, the alms of strangers hands. But now, with lighter wings the moments fly, And bring the period of his labours nigh. In Munster's walls, assiduous fate prepares, With endless honours to reward his cares. Munster, which gave th' illustrious father birth, Shall now be conscious of the filial worth. In this, his future glory's destined scene, The great Adepts in Hermes' art convene, Who boast, with vain fallacious science bold, To change each baser ore to purest gold. But ne'er will righteous heav'n its gifts impart To the corrupted and ungrateful heart, Where lawless lust and wild ambition reign, And pride and base insatiate thirst of gain. Hence, all in vain, they bring their boasted stone, In vain their powders on the mass are thrown. Their weak attempts the juster fates oppose, And unmatured, unchanged the metal flows. Then one advancing, who possest alone, A fluid extract from th' all-pow'rful stone, Three fatal drops amid the furnace spills: The liquid mass a sudden vapour fills, By quick dilation; and with dreadful sound, Exploded, drives the glowing metal round. The fearful omen all the fabric shook, When thus the race of great Bombastus spoke: Oh! why, my friends, for this divine essay, Why have you chose this unauspicious day? Twere wiser sure your trials to postpone Till the last eve of frowning Mars be gone. Your cares suspended till the rising dawn, By prosp'rous Venus, usher'd o'er the lawn, Shall sure succeed: for on that sacred morn Was great Basilius Valentinus born. With solemn rites invoke his learned shade, So may his genius your projection aid. Thus far the Sage, when loud applauses rung In glad assent, from each approving tongue. To feastful mirth they dedicate the night, And hail the morning with the solemn rite. That night, so Fate decreed, Scriblerus gains The sacred grove on Munster's neighb'ring plains. There stretcht at ease, his wearied limbs he laid, And slept unconscious of the friendly shade. Lo! ere the morn dispensed her earliest light, Great Plutus' form, conspicuous to the sight, Before him stood, and thus his speech addrest: Thrice happy Sage, by fav'ring fortune blest, On this auspicious morn th' unwearied sun His annual course around the globe has run, Since parting from thy friends on Genoa's sands, Thou trod'st with toilsome steps a length of barren lands. Arise, and thro' the grove pursue thy way: Observe the course of yon propitious ray: That splendid guide shall lead thee to the flow'r Whose root alone can boast th' aurific power. But, lest thou doubt, or think the promise vain, Soon as Aurora glads th' enlighten'd plain, A goose majestic o'er the lake shall ride, And thirty milk-white goslins by her side. Be thy chief care with sacrifice t' asswage, And humble off'rings, injur'd Saturn's rage. Nor less due honours to my pow'r belong, Selected victims and a grateful song. That god am I, whose universal sway All nations own, and willing all obey. Tho' not from heav'n I boast my honour'd birth, Yet ever dearest to the sons of earth. He said, and disappear'd; when from the ground, The Hero starting, cast his eyes around. Lo! all-propitious to his raptured sight, An ignis-fatuus, with portentous light, From the dank earth exhaled, began to move: His course directing thro' the dusky grove. With zeal the Sage revered th' auspicious ray, And toil'd intrepid thro' the thorny way. At length the vapour stopt. With eager eyes, Awhile he view'd, then seized the matchless prize. The matchless prize its conscious leaves expands, Springs to the fated touch and meets his hands. And now the rosy morn began to dawn: He quits the grove and issues on the lawn; When wond'rous to relate! a strange portent Gives fresh assurance of the wish'd event. He sees the stately goose in swan-like pride The silver lake with oary feet divide; And thirty milk-white goslins by her side. Inspir'd with grateful zeal he hastes to seize The goodly prey, and to the gods decrees. When lo! the dying victims plaints alarm The mournful shores and reach the neighb'ring farm; Their well-known voice the startled Sylvia hears, And flies, impell'd by sad prophetic fears. This flock the Virgin cherish'd with her care, With pens protected from the evening air; Each morning from her hand they ate their food, Then sought their cackling kindred on the flood; There bathing all the day, at night they came To their known lodgings, and their Country Dame. Now all alarm'd, she hastes to their relief: But oh! what language can express her grief, When she, like wretched Niobe, beheld Her hopes all welt'ring on th' ensanguin'd field! Yet soon her sorrow yields to nobler rage, And furious she attacks th' astonish'd Sage. Frequent and thick her desperate blows she deals; Beneath her arm the stagger'd champion reels. Again the maiden lifts her vengeful hands, But now prepared the bold Scriblerus stands; With watchful eyes he wards the threaten'd blow; And strives to grapple with his active foe. Artful she baffles his superior might, And doubtful holds the fortune of the fight. So fought the Thracian Amazons of old, While tinged with virgin blood Thermodon roll'd. Such and so brave was great Alcides seen, When dauntless he engaged the Maiden Queen. The bold virago her dread arm extends; Full on his cheek the weighty blow descends. Crush'd with the stroke, his shatter'd jaws resound; And his loose teeth fall frequent to the ground. Firm and unmoved the Hero keeps the field, And bold with passive valour, scorns to yield: At length observing her defenceless waist, Th' unguarded virgin in his arms embraced; His griping arms her struggling limbs confine, And on the plain the Heroine falls supine. Scriblerus following, the fall'n maiden prest, And prostrate lay, victorious on her breast. Thus sage Ulysses, for his art renown'd, O'erturn'd the strength of Ajax on the ground: He shook the yielding earth, an helpless load, The victor chief his giant limbs bestrode. Thus as he lay, the Sage triumphant spoke: Behold how fate, by one decisive stroke, To me the laurels of the day ordains; To thee subjection and opprobrious chains; To thee the laws of combat to fulfil, The vanquish'd yielding to the victor's will. Thus was the chaste Hippolyte compell'd To the proud foe her virgin charms to yield. And thus each stoutest Amazonian Dame, Resign'd her beauties to the Conqu'rors flame, Yet not my heart these vanities inspire, Nor sensual burns my breast with lawless fire, Or knows my chaster soul a thought so base, To force thee helpless to a lewd embrace. Not thus the Sage his great pursuit attains: But endless travel, and incessant pains, Severest abstinence from ev'ry joy, Must all his thoughts engage, and all his hours employ. Then rise a spotless virgin from my arms, And bear unrifled hence thy maiden charms. Thus, gracious, the self-conquer'd conqu'ror spoke, And by the hand the trembling maiden took. Her soul possest, at once, with grief and rage She flies, regardless of th' assiduous Sage, Springs from his grasp, and seeks the thickest grove Like sullen Dido from her faithless Love. The borders of the lucid lake he seeks, And hastes to cleanse his blood-polluted cheeks. Now Phœbus, o'er the lofty mountain's height, Pours on fair Munster's tow'rs his golden light. Scriblerus hails the birth-place of his fire, And joy and filial love his soul inspire. END OF THE FIFTH BOOK. BOOK VI. ARGUMENT. Scriblerus meets with the son of Faustus the Alchymist, who invites him to his house. Faustus explains to him the cause of their festival, and relates the history of Basilius Valentinus. The Alchymists are again baffled in their attempt to transmute the lead. Scriblerus desires to make a trial; is refused on account of his mean appearance, but discovering his name and family, is admitted with honour to the furnace. He soon obtains a colour, which success is received with universal applause. They contend who shall pay him the greatest respect, and eagerly embrace the proposal of Bossius to beatify him. The Hero, by a presentiment, is aware of the accidents that may happen at this important crisis, and advises to postpone the honours designed him 'till the great work be fully accomplished, left vanity, which already begins to possess his mind, should stop the progress of it, and perhaps entirely disappoint their expectations. His speech is interrupted by their enthusiastic zeal, and they immediately proceed to beatification. And now the Poet having conducted Scriblerus through a series of adventures, with success beyond the expectation of a mortal, concludes his poem with the Apotheosis of his Hero. Thus, wrapt in thought, the Hero trod the plain, When, sudden, rushing from the hills amain, A youthful sportsman flies with rapid pace, And, o'er the lawn, pursues his insect chace. A waistcoat of the thinnest silk he wore, And in his hand, of slightest texture, bore A curious net, whose meshes light and rare Scarce shone distinguish'd from th' unbodied air. And now the plain's remotest verge he treads, Now, nigh the Sage, the chace his footsteps leads; Now in his slender toils he holds the prey, And joyful to Scriblerus bends his way. Stranger, contemplate well, with earnest eyes, Eager he calls, this paragon of flies. Observe him o'er; and tell if thou hast seen, Or on the trees, or on the level green, His pregnant mate, the precious insect show, And claim whate'er my bounty can bestow. O! youth, the Sage replies, nor have I seen Or on the trees, or on the level green, The pregnant consort of your beauteous game, Nor aught, tho' needy, from your bounty claim. Yet oh! vouchsafe one hospitable boon, Declare the name os yon majestic town, And point the way. To Munster's proud abode, The youth replies, companion of the road Myself thy steps will guide. Be thou my guest: For sure some secret pow'r informs my breast Thou draw'st thy lineage from no vulgar race, And thro' thy rags a godlike mien I trace. From far-fam'd ancestors my birth I claim, A glorious lineage! Faustus is my name. My great exploits th' Aurelian sages show, Their walls resplendent with my labours glow. Propitious Hermes to my sire imparts The greatest, noblest of all human arts. Obedient Vulcan owns his high commands, Nor changeful Proteus can elude his hands. He said: his words the Hero's breast inflame; But chief, O Faustus, thy auspicious name, Sure presage of success. With streaming eyes, His joys dissembling, thus the Sage replies. Thrice bounteous youth, my grateful thanks receive, 'Tis all alas! that poverty can give. Once happier days were mine; and not the least In Hermes' art, was known your wretched guest; And O! were now some chymic task assign'd, The god would still support th' industrious mind. To temper lute; the never-dying flame To tend, assiduous as the Vestal dame. With muffled face corroding fumes to dare, Nor pounded poison's subtlest atoms fear. Not undeserving would I eat my bread, An idle loit'rer on your bounty fed. Scriblerus thus disguised his promised fate, And now they reach great Faustus' friendly gate. When thus the courteous youth his Sire addrest: Disdain not to receive this stranger guest, Tho' mean the garb which wraps the man of woe, Tho' thus he roam a mendicant in show. Oft, like the sun behind some dusky cloud, Is Learning known her radiant head to shroud In tatter'd robes; and frequent have we seen Ev'n wit, affecting a neglected mien, In rags like these, all specious pomp abjured, Chuse to reside; his glory unobscured. Stranger, the Sire replies, in happy hour Thou com'st, directed by some fav'ring pow'r. Propitious Venus sped thee on thy way To share the triumphs of this glorious day Sacred to science and to festal mirth, The day which gave the great Basilius birth. Free and unquestion'd enter, and prepare The due libation and the solemn prayer. Or if thy curious bosom burn to hear Why thus Basilius mem'ry we revere; Or why to his distinguish'd shade belong The hallow'd victim and the votive song, Attend. To this illustrious Sage were known The long-sought virtues of the wond'rous stone, Potent the fleeting spirit to restore, Or to pure gold convert the baser ore. Thus had th' adept prolong'd his niggard span, Thus had he liv'd immortal, tho' a Man. But wayward fortune takes a spleenful joy The wisest schemes of mortals to destroy. The Sage, long wasted with consuming cares, His body bending with a weight of years, When now he felt the tyrant hand of death, Thus to his son addrest his latest breath: With painful watching and incessant pray'r, Nine tedious months I labour'd to prepare The precious drops this chrystal vase contains, The rich reward of all my wasting pains. Now mark, my son, and with attentive ear, The virtues of our great Elixir hear. When hast'ning age the call of fate obeys, When the soul sickens, and the sense decays, When all the weaken'd organs lose their tone, The nerves relax'd, th' elastic vigour gone, When ev'n the life-blood stagnates in my heart, Soon as thou seest my latest breath depart, Within my lips the sacred med'cine pour; The draught vivific shall my soul restore; Course thro' the veins, the springs of life renew, And ev'ry nerve with active force endue. So may your pious gratitude bestow On me the life which to your Sire you owe; And when thy soul obeys the call of fate, To thee the precious gift will I repeat. Thus may we oft renew the mutual boon, Thus lose the names of Father and of Son. He said, and sunk to death. Th' unduteous boy, Drunk with delusive hopes of worldly joy, And still mistrustful of his Sire's controul, Checks ev'ry thought of duty in his soul. To common earth commits the lifeless corse, Nor hears great nature's call, or feels remorse. And now he hastes new pleasures to explore; Some new expence to vent his endless store. From vice to vice, with tasteless ardour roves, And cloy'd, ere night rejects his morning loves. A son he had; Renatus was he nam'd: Transmitted vice his genuine birth proclaim'd. No generous passion warm'd his brutal breast, But basest av'rice all his soul possest. Suspicion, which in vicious minds supplies Bright wisdom's post, and points the jealous eyes, Directs the Sire his sordid soul to scan, Who thus prepared his artful speech began. Thou know'st, my son, thy Grandsire's virtues claim An ample tribute from the voice of fame. And oft have I confest this plenteous tide Of endless treasure by his art supply'd. Yet one important secret still remains; One blest attainment of his pious pains. 'Twas on an hallow'd and auspicious hour, When thus, inspired by strange prophetic pow'r, The great Basilius spake: Behold the yellow Lion shall go forth, A potent monarch from the frozen North: The swift-wing'd eagle from his claws shall fly, The griffon shall but see his face and die: The crow, cameleon, and the dragon's blood, Mixt with the virgin's milk shall be his food; The salamander shall his rule obey; And all the sons of earth shall own his sway. Thus he by figurative signs exprest The truths that roll'd tumultuous in his breast, With pray'r and fasting then the holy man The sacred heav'n-directed work began. Nine months within the womb of time it lay; At length began its glories to display. Then spake the lab'ring Sage: my son, attend; Learn thy conception, and thy wond'rous end. On that auspicious ever-honoured morn Wast thou conceived, on which thy Sire was born. The sun himself presided at thy birth; Nor shall thy body turn to common earth. The sacred influence of his virtuous ray Exalts thine essence, and sublimes thy clay. Thy body thus prepared, these drops shall save From foul corruption and the loathsome grave; Th' elixir swallow'd ere thy corse be cold, Shall all thy limbs convert to purest gold. Basilius thus his wond'rous art display'd, And to my hands the precious drops convey'd. Then, when in death, a recent corse, I lie, Be thine the pow'rful med'cine to apply. Renatus heard the tale with secret joy, And thus, with frequent tears, reply'd the boy: Obedient, I receive thy great commands; Yet think not, that, with sacrilegious hands, Thy son shall e'er thy dear remains abuse, Or prostitute thy limbs to common use. But in the consecrated fane bestow'd, Adore at once the statue and the god: Before thy shrine perpetual incense burn, And filial duty to devotion turn. Thus while he spake, he views his father's height With rapture, and compute's his future weight. The limbs he measures with desiring eyes, Impatient to transmute the bulky prize. Nor long laments the promised boon delay'd, But soon with joy the breathless corse survey'd. Then, big with hope, the potent med'cine brought, And the rich drops pour'd, trembling, down his throat. Already the rich drops their virtues prove; And half the dose impell'd the limbs to move. Up-rose the body, with a sudden bound, And dash'd the shiver'd chrystal on the ground. Th' elixir lost, the corse returns to dust. Great is our ruler; all his ways are just. Thus holy Faustus ends the wond'rous tale, And all the great Basilius' fate bewail, Cursing his race, degenerate: then repair, Regardful of the day, to fervent pray'r. Scriblerus now a crucible provides, And spreads the glowing heat around it's sides. Then, placed within, the fatal root calcines; And soon his hospitable friends rejoins. Unwitting Faustus to his guest declares What great designs employ their present cares. Then leads him where in solemn order sate Th' assembled sages of th' hermetic state. Up-rose the learned Paracelsus' heir, And, pious, first preferr'd his solemn pray'r. When thus: My friends, on this auspicious day, Let each with confidence his art essay. Nor shall your last attempt your art controul, For sure some pow'r prophetic tells my soul, That long ere Hesper's radiant lamp shall glow, Yon mass impure in genuine gold will flow. He said: and straitway to the furnace past, And on the molten lead his powders cast. No change, alas! their fancied pow'rs impart, The boaster mourns his ineffectual art. Again, in turn, advance the learned train Their art to try, they try their art in vain. When thus Scriblerus to the chiefs addrest The secret thoughts long-lab'ring in his breast: Ye great Adepts, thrice-honour'd Sages, hear, And chief O! Faustus, lend a fav'ring ear. And O! forgive that 'till this destin'd hour, Th' unutter'd secret in my breast I bore. Great Plutus, patron of th' hermetic art, To me has deign'd th' elixir to impart. Has giv'n me to possess the sacred flow'r, Whose root alone can boast th' aurific pow'r: Alone transmute yon mass impure and base, And vindicate our science from disgrace. Th' Adepts in silence witness'd their surprize, But scann'd his garments with contemptuous eyes: Till Faustus rose, and in his arms embraced The tatter'd sage, and near the furnace placed. When thus the race of great Bombastus spoke; His haughty frame indignant anger shook. O! thoughtless, shall yon mendicant engage This arduous task which baffles ev'ry sage? Shall hinds and beggars to that art aspire Which foils th' attempts of Munster's learned choir? But grant him with success and glory crown'd, To us how grateful must his glories sound? The voice of fame shall thus our honours stain. “The learn'd Adepts their art essay'd in vain: “In came a Stroller of th' empyric crew, “And did what all those sages could not do.” The Hero now disclaims his base disguise, And thus with conscious dignity replies: Behold Scriblerus, no ignoble name: Earth sounds my wisdom, and high heav'n my fame. So great a name amazed each hearer's breast, A reverential awe their hearts possess'd. Now on the Sage their eager eyes they bent; And, all-suspended, wait the great event. Thus as they stood around, Scriblerus spread The pow'rful ashes on the molten lead. Soon the dull mass assumed a nobler hue; With sudden change the heighten'd colours grew. Now Luna shines with pallid radiance bright, Now Sol begins to dart his ruddy light; Scriblerus' praise employ'd each raptured tongue, And all around the loud applauses rung. Then thus the Sage the learn'd Adepts address'd: As yet ye see but half my art express'd: For know, this precious med'cine boasts the pow'r The fleeting life, departed, to restore. Tho' cold and breathless at my feet ye lay, My potent art should animate your clay; Nay more, to youth recall the drooping sire, And in his nerves infuse their pristine fire. O! would some Sage, th' elixir's force to try, Here in the cause of science bravely die, Science should soon restore his yielded breath, And claim her martyr from the jaws of death. Scarce had he spoke when all with eager strife, Stretch their bare throats and pant to meet the knife. When lo! a casuist from the croud arose, Their rash designs, by reas'ning to oppose. With cited cases, points, quotations, saws, Expounds what conscience wills, and what the laws. If man shall murder man; the laws decide The punishment decreed on homicide. And this must follow, if the lawyers plead, That tho' restor'd, the man in fact was dead. If to your throats yourselves the weapon guide, Th' indictment then will lie for suicide. O! think how dreadful at the bar to stand, For your own death by your own desp'rate hand! What shame, what horror shall your bosoms shake Condemn'd alive to feel the piercing stake! The casuist's words the stagger'd croud divide; When calmly thus the thoughtful man reply'd: On this blest day no human blood be shed, This day to science and to mirth decreed. No, rather let an aged cow be brought, While, careful, I prepare the potent draught. Unscrup'lous will we drain her torpid blood, And soon renew the meliorated flood. Long ere the sun completes his daily round, A frisking calf shall o'er the meadows bound. Thus pow'rful Colchis drench'd the feeble ram, And from the cauldron leapt a wanton lamb. Now crown'd with wreaths an aged cow they bring, While shouts of joy from every quarter ring. Not in more pomp, with mystic garlands dress'd, March'd Apis, usher'd by the Memphian priest. Her aged veins, impatient, they divide, And drain, at length, her slowly-ebbing tide. They pour the med'cine, bind the weeping wound, And leave her corse extended on the ground, Confiding in the draught. Again they raise Their voice in rapture to Scriblerus' praise. Then Bossius spake: Sure Heav'n my soul inspires, And prompts me to excite th' electric fires. Raise then, my friends, the well-constructed stage, There, placed on high, beatify the Sage, Stripp'd of these rags unseemly to the sight, And cloath'd with radiance and celestial light. He said. His words the pleased assembly caught, Who soon, obedient to his dictates, brought Of pitch and rosin an enormous mass: Six ample globes, and six vast tubes of glass. From these th' Adepts a mystic structure made; And in the midst the great Scriblerus laid In naked majesty, tremendous sight! Then haste to execute the solemn rite. Yet ere they fill the chorus of his praise, Thus spake the man long versed in fortune's ways. Alas! my friends, forbear this rash design, Nor crown a mortal with rewards divine. I fear this premature, this thoughtless joy Has raised a vice our triumphs to destroy. Yes, I confess myself have felt its pow'r, The hapless victim of this fatal hour. I, whom in vain, Ambition strove to move, And baffled Lust, beside yon conscious grove: Whom not all-conqu'ring Luxury could gain, Whom sordid Avarice assail'd in vain. O Vanity, thou fixt and ling'ring guest, Thou last of vices in the noble breast! Who like the worm within the specious rind, Prey'st undiscover'd on the fairest mind— Thus spake the moral Sage; but thoughtless They Whirl the loud wheel, and tune the lofty lay. Impetuous zeal with wild unruly noise, Breaks on his speech, and drowns his sapient voice. And now the glass by strong attrition urged, First the foul atmosphere around him purged. Then at the Hero's feet began to play A flame more brilliant than the solar ray. The golden beams ascending now embraced Th' illustrious Sage, and circled round his waist. Now fixt, and by encreased effluvia fed, Diffused a glory from his awful head. Thus as he darts around electric fire, To vocal hymns they tune the sounding lyre; His high atchievements in their songs relate, And hail him Monarch of th' Hermetic State. Such honours Munster to her Hero paid; And lambent flames around his temples play'd. THE END OF THE SIXTH AND LAST BOOK. MISCELLANEOUS VERSES, WRITTEN AT TWICKENHAM. FROM 1751 to 1801. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT AND HIS SERVANT, In Imitation of the 7th Satire of the Second Book of Horace. Quid leges sine moribus Vanæ proficiunt. Hor. [FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1752.] Servant. LONG have I heard your fav'rite theme, A gen'ral reformation scheme, To keep the Poor from ev'ry sin, From gaming, murther, and from gin. And now have I no less an itch To venture to reform the Rich. Member. What, John! are you too turn'd projector? Come then, for once I'll hear your lecture. For since a member, as 'tis said, His projects to his servants read, And of a fav'rite speech a book made, With which he tired each night a cook-maid, And so it hap't that ev'ry morning The tasteless creatures gave him warning— Since thus we use 'em, 'tis but reason We hear our servants in their season. Begin. Servant. Like gamblers, half mankind Persist in constant vice combined, In races, routes, the stews, and White's, Pass all their days and all their nights. Others again, like lady Prue, Who gives the morning church its due, At noon is painted, drest and curl'd, And one amongst the wicked world: Keeps her account exactly even As thus: Prue, Creditor with heaven, By sermons heard on extra days: Debtor: To masquerades and plays. Item: By Whitfield, half an hour: Per Contra: To the Colonel, four. Others, I say, pass half their time In folly, idleness, or crime; Then all at once, their zeal grows warm, And every throat resounds reform. A lord his youth in ev'ry vice Indulged, but chief in drabs and dice. Till worn by age, disease, and gout: Then nature modestly gave out. Not so my lord—who still, by proxy, Play'd with his darling dice and doxy. I laud this constant wretch's state And pity all who fluctuate; Prefer this slave to dear backgammon, To those who serve both God and Mammon: To those who take such pains to awe The nation's vices by the law, Yet while they draw their bills so ample, Neglect the influence of example. Member. To whom d'ye preach this senseless sermon? Servant. To you, good sir. Member. To me, ye vermin? Servant. To you, who ev'ry day profess T' admire the times of good Queen Bess. But yet your heart sincerer praise Bestows on these or Charles's days: You still approve some absent place (The present's ever in disgrace.) And, such your special inconsistence, Make the chief merit in the distance. If e'er you miss a supper-card (Tho' all the while you think it hard) You're all for solitude and quiet, Good hours and vegetable diet, Reflexion, air, and elbow room: No prison like a crouded drum. But should you meet her Grace's summons In full committee of the commons, Tho' well you know her crouded house Will scarce contain another mouse, You quit the bus'ness of the nation, And brethren of the reformation. Tho' ? begs you'll stay and vote, And zealous ? tears your coat. You damn your coachman, storm and stare; And tear your throat to call a chair. Nay, never frown, and good now hold Your hand awhile: I've been so bold To paint your follies; now I'm in, Let's have a word or two on sin. Last night I heard a learned poulterer Lay down the law against th' adulterer: And let me tell you, sir, that few Hear better doctrine in a pew. Well! you may laugh at Robin Hood: I wish your studies were as good. From Mandeville you take your morals: Your faith from controversial quarrels; But ever lean to those who scribble Their crudities against the bible; Yet tell me I shall crack my brain With hearing Henley or Romaine. Deserves that critic most rebuke In judging on the Pentateuch, Who deems it, with some wild fanatics, The only school of mathematics: Or he, who making grave profession, To lay aside all prepossession, Calls it a bookseller's edition Of maim'd records and vague tradition? You covet, sir, your neighbour's goods: I take a girl at Peter Wood's; And when I've turn'd my back upon her, Unwounded in my heart or honour, I feel nor infamous, nor jealous Of richer culls, or prettier fellows. But you, the grave and sage reformer, Must go by stealth to meet your charmer; Must change your star and ev'ry note Of honour for a bear-skin coat. That legislative head so wise Must stoop to base and mean disguise; Some Abigail must then receive you, Bribed by the husband to deceive you. She spies Cornuto on the stairs: Wakes you; then melted by your pray'rs, Yields, if with greater bribe you ask it, To pack your worship in the basket. Laid neck and heels true Falstaff fashion; Then form new schemes of reformation. Thus 'scaped the murd'ring husband's fury, Or thumping fine of cuckold jury; Henceforth, in mem'ry of your danger, You'll live to all intrigues a stranger. No; ere you've time for this reflection; Some new debauch is in projection. And for the next approaching night, Contrivance for another fright. This makes you, tho' so great, so grave, Nay! wonder not, an abject slave. As much a slave as I: nay more; I serve one master, you a score. And as your various passions rule, By turns are twenty tyrants' fool. Member. Who then is free? Servant. The wise alone, Who only bows to reason's throne; Whom neither want, nor death, nor chains, Nor subtle persecutor's pains, Nor honours, wealth, nor lust can move From virtue and his country's love. Self-guarded like a globe of steel, External insults can he feel? Or e'er present one weaker part To fortune's most insidious dart. Much honour'd master, may you find These wholesome symptoms in your mind. Can you be free while passions rule you? While women ev'ry moment fool you? While forty mad capricious whores Invite, then turn you out of doors; Of ev'ry doit contrive to trick you, Then bid their happier footman kick you. Convinced by ev'ry new disaster, You serve a more despotic master; Say can your pride or folly see Such difference 'twixt yourself and me? Shall you be struck with Titian's tints, And mayn't I stop to stare at prints? Disposed along th' extensive glass They catch and hold me ere I pass. Where Slack is made to box with Broughton, I see the very stage they fought on: The bruisers live, and move, and bleed, As if they fought in very deed. Yet I'm a loiterer, to be sure, You a great judge and connoisseur.

Can it be deem'd a shame or sin To pawn my livery for gin, While bonds and mortgages at White's Shall raise your fame with Arthur's knights? Those worthies seem to see no shame in, Nor strive to pass a slur on gaming; But rather to devise each session Some law in honour o' th' profession: Lest sordid hands, or vulgar place, The noble myst'ry should debase; Lest ragged scoundrels in an alehouse, Should chalk their cheatings on the bellows; Or boys the sacred rites profane With orange-barrows in a lane. Where lies the merit of your labours To curb the follies of your neighbours; Deter the gambler and prevent his Confed'rate arts to gull the 'prentice; Unless you could yourself desist From hazard, faro, brag, and whist? Unless your philosophic mind Can from within amusement sind, And give at once to use and pleasure That truly precious time, your leisure.

THE INTRUDER. IN IMITATION OF HORACE, BOOK I. SATIRE IX. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR 1754. A certain free familiar Spark Pertly accosts me in the Park: ‘'Tis lovely weather sure! how gay ‘The sun!—I give you, sir, good day.’ Your servant, sir. To you the same— But—give me leave to crave your name? ‘My name? why sure you've seen my face ‘About in ev'ry public place. ‘I'm known to almost all your friends, ‘(No one e'er names you but commends.) ‘For some I plant; for some I build; ‘In ev'ry taste and fashion skill'd— ‘Were there the least regard for merit!— ‘The rich in purse are poor in spirit. ‘You know sir Pagode: (here I'll give ye ‘A front I've drawn him for a privy) ‘This winter, sir, as I'm a sinner, ‘He has not ask'd me once to dinner.’ Quite overpower'd with this intrusion I stood in silence and confusion. He took th' advantage and pursued: ‘Perhaps, sir, you may think me rude; ‘But sure I may suppose my talk ‘Will less disturb you while you walk: ‘And yet I now may spoil a thought: ‘But that's indeed a venial fault:— ‘I only mean to such, d'ye see, ‘Who write with ease like you and me. ‘I write a sonnet in a minute: ‘Upon my soul there's nothing in it. ‘But you to all your friends are partial: ‘You reckon ? another Martial— ‘He'd think a fortnight well bestow'd ‘To write an epigram or ode. ‘?'s no poet to my knowledge;— ‘I knew him very well at college: ‘I've writ more verses in an hour, ‘Than he could ever do in four. ‘You'll find me better worth your knowing— ‘But tell me; which way are you going?’ What various tumults swell'd my breast, With passion, shame, disgust opprest! This courtship from my brother Poet! Sure no similitude can show it. Not young Adonis, when pursued By amorous antiquated prude; Not Gulliver's distressful face, When in the Yahoe's loath'd embrace. In rage, confusion, and dismay, Not knowing what to do or say: And having no recourse but lying,— A friend at Lambeth lies a dying.— ‘Lambeth!’ (he reassumes his talk) ‘Across the bridge—the finest walk.— ‘Don't you admire the Chinese bridges, ‘That wave in furrows and in ridges? ‘They've finish'd such an one at Hampton: ‘Faith 'twas a plan I never dreamt on— ‘The prettiest thing that e'er was seen— ‘'Tis printed in the Magazine.—’ This wild farrago who could bear? Sometimes I run; then stop and stare; Vex'd and tormented to the quick, By turns grow choleric and sick: And glare my eye, and shew the white, Like vicious horses when they'd bite. Regardless of my eye or ear, His jargon he renews— ‘D'ye hear ‘Who 'twas composed the Taylor's dance? ‘I practised fifteen months in France. ‘I wrote a play—'twas done in haste— ‘I know the present want of taste, ‘And dare not trust it on the town— ‘No tragedy will e'er go down. ‘The new burletta 's now the thing— ‘Pray did you never hear me sing? Never indeed.— ‘Next time we meet— ‘We're just now coming to the street.— ‘Bless me! I almost had forgot: ‘There's poor Jack Stiles will go to pot. ‘Sir Scrutiny has prest me daily ‘To be this hour at the Old Bailey, ‘To witness to his good behaviour: ‘My uncle's voter under favour— ‘Egad, I'm puzzled what to do, ‘To save him will be losing you. ‘Yet we must save him if we can, ‘For he's a stanch one, A cant term for a sure vote. a dead man.’ By your account he's so indeed, Unless you make some better speed. This moment fly to save your friend— Or else prepare him for his end. ‘Hang him he's but a single vote; ‘I wish the halter round his throat. ‘To Lambeth I attend you, sir.’ Upon my soul you shall not stir: Preserve your voter from the gallows: Can human nature be so callous? So negligent when life's at stake? ‘I'd hang a hundred for your sake.’ I wish you'd do as much by me— Or any thing to set me free. Deaf to my words, he talks along Still louder than the buzzing throng. ‘Are you, he cries, as well as ever ‘With lady Grace? she's vastly clever?’ Her merit all the world declare: Few, very few her friendship share. ‘If you'd contrive to introduce ‘Your friend here, you might find an use—’ Sir, in that house there's no such doing, And the attempt would be one's ruin. No art, no project, no designing. No rivalship and no outshining. ‘Indeed! you make me long the more ‘To get admittance. Is the door ‘Kept by so rude, so hard a clown, ‘As will not melt at half-a-crown? ‘Can't I cajole the female tribe ‘And gain her woman with a bribe? ‘Refused to-day, suck up my sorrow, ‘And take my chance again to-morrow? ‘Is there no shell-work to be seen, ‘Or Chinese chair or Indian screen? ‘No cockatoo nor marmozet, ‘Lap-dog, gold fish, nor perroquet? ‘No French embroidery on a quilt? ‘And no bow-window to be built? ‘Can't I contrive, at times, to meet ‘My lady in the park or street? ‘At opera, play, or morning pray'r, ‘To hand her to her coach or chair?’ But now his voice, tho' late so loud, Was lost in the contentious crowd Of fishwives newly corporate, A colony from Billingsgate. That instant on the bridge I spy'd Lord Truewit coming from his ride. My lord,—Sir William (I began) Has given me power to state a plan, To settle ev'ry thing between you; And so—'tis lucky that I've seen you. This morning.— ‘Hold,’ replies the peer, And tips me a malicious leer, ‘Against good breeding to offend ‘And rudely take you from your Friend!’ (His lordship, by the way, can spy How matters go with half an eye: And loves, in proper time and place, To laugh behind the gravest face.) ‘'Tis Saturday.—I should not chuse ‘To break the sabbath of the Jews.’ The Jews! my Lord!— ‘Why fince this pother, ‘I own I'm grown a weaker brother; ‘Faith! persecution is no joke:— ‘—I once was going to have spoke:— ‘Bus'ness may stay till Monday night: ‘'Tis prudent to be sure you're right.’ He went his way. I raved and fumed: To what ill fortune am I doom'd! But fortune had, it seems, decreed That moment for my being freed. Our talk, which had been somewhat loud, Insensibly the market crowd Around my persecutor drew; And made 'em take him for a Jew. To me the caitiff now appeals; But I took fairly to my heels; And, pitiless of his condition, On brink of Thames and Inquisition, Left him to take his turn and listen To each uncircumcised Philistine. O Phœbus! happy he whose trust is In thee and thy poetic justice. THE FABLE OF JOTHAM: TO THE BOROUGH-HUNTERS. (FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1754.) “Jotham's Fable of the Trees is the oldest that is extant, and as beautiful as any which have been made since that time.” Addison. JUDGES, Chap. ix. v. 8. Old Plumb, who tho' blest in his Kentish retreat, Still thrives by his oilshop in Leadenhall-street, With a Portugal merchant, a knight by creation, From a Borough in Cornwall received invitation. Well-assured of each vote, well equip't from the alley, In quest of election-adventures they sally. Tho' much they discoursed, the long way to beguile, Of the earthquakes, the Jews, and the change of the stile, Of the Irish, the stocks, and the lott'ry committee, They came silent and tired into Exeter city. ‘Some books, prithee landlord, to pass a dull hour; ‘No nonsense of parsons, or methodists sour, ‘No poetical stuff—a damn'd jingle of rhimes, ‘But some pamphlet that's new and a touch on the times.’ ‘O Lord! says mine host, you may hunt the town round, ‘I question if any such thing can be found: ‘I never was ask'd for a book by a guest; ‘And I'm sure I have all the great folk in the West. ‘None of these to my knowledge e'er call'd for a book; ‘But see, sir, the woman with fish, and the cook; ‘Here's the fattest of carp, shall we dress you a brace? ‘Would you chuse any soals, or a mullet, or plaice?’ ‘A Place, quoth the knight, we must have to be sure, ‘But first let us see that our Borough's secure. ‘We'll talk of the Place when we've settled the poll: ‘They may dress us for supper the mullet and soal. ‘But do you, my good landlord, look over your shelves, ‘For a book we must have, we're so tired of ourselves.’ ‘In troth, sir, I ne'er had a book in my life, ‘But the prayer-book and bible I bought for my wife.’ ‘Well! the bible must do; but why don't you take in ‘Some monthly collection? the New Magazine?’ The bible was brought and laid out on the table, And open'd at Jotham's most apposite fable; The tale of the Trees. This chimed in with their bent: And Plumb look't for an hint for his planting in Kent. Sir Freeport began with this verse, tho' no rhime— ‘The Trees of the forest went forth on a time, (To what purpose our candidates scarce could expect, For it was not, they found, to transplant—but elect) ‘To the Olive and Fig-tree their deputies came, ‘But by both were refused and their answer the same: ‘Quoth the Olive, “Shall I leave my fatness and oil “For an unthankful office, a dignified toil?” “Shall I leave, quoth the Fig-tree, my sweetness and fruit, “To be envy'd, or slaved in so vain a pursuit?” ‘Thus rebuff'd and surprized they apply'd to the Vine, ‘He answer'd:— “Shall I leave my grapes and my wine? “(Wine the sovereign cordial of god and of man) “To be made or the tool or the head of a clan?” ‘At last, as it always falls out in a scramble, ‘The mob gave the cry for—“a Bramble! a Bramble! “A Bramble for ever!”—O! chance unexpected! ‘But Bramble prevail'd and was duly elected.’— ‘O! ho! quoth the knight, with a look most profound, ‘Now I see there's some good in good books to be found. ‘I wish I had read this same Bible before: ‘Of long miles at the least 'twould have saved us fourscore. ‘You, Plumb, with your olives and oil might have staid, ‘And myself might have tarried my wines to unlade. ‘What have merchants to do from their business to ramble? ‘Your electioneer-errant should still be a Bramble.’ Thus ended at once the wise comment on Jotham, And our Citizens' jaunt to the borough of Gotham. THE FAKEER: A TALE. [FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1756.] A Fakeer (a Religious well known in the East, Not much like a parson, still less like a priest) With no canting, no sly jesuitical arts, Field-preaching, hypocrisy, learning or parts; By a happy refinement in mortification, Grew the oracle, saint, and the pope of his nation. But what did he do this esteem to acquire? Did he torture his head or his bosom with fire? Was his neck in a portable pillory cased? Did he fasten a chain to his leg or his waist? No. His holiness rose to this sovereign pitch By the merit of running long nails in his breech. A wealthy young Indian, approaching the shrine, Thus in banter accosts the prophetic divine: This tribute accept for your interest with FO, Whom with torture you serve, and whose will you must know; To your suppliant disclose his immortal decree; Tell me which of the heav'ns is allotted for me. Fakeer. Let me first know your merits. Indian. I strive to be just: To be true to my friend, to my wife, to my trust: In religion I duly observe ev'ry form: With an heart to my country devoted and warm: I give to the poor, and I lend to the rich— Fakeer. But how many nails do you run in your breech? Indian. With submission I speak to your rev'rence's tail; But mine has no taste for a tenpenny nail. Fakeer. Well! I'll pray to our prophet and get you preferr'd; Though no farther expect than to heaven the third. With me in the thirtieth your seat to obtain, You must qualify duly with hunger and pain. Indian. With you in the thirtieth! You impudent rogue! Can such wretches as you give to madness a vogue! Though the priesthood of FO on the vulgar impose, By squinting whole years at the end of their nose, Though with cruel devices of mortification They adore a vain idol of human creation, Does the God of the heav'ns such a service direct? Can his mercy approve a self-punishing sect? Will his wisdom be worshipp'd with chains and with nails? Or e'er look for his rites in your noses and tails? Come along to my house and these penances leave, Give your belly a feast, and your breech a reprieve. This reas'ning unhinged each fanatical notion; And stagger'd our saint, in his chair of promotion. At length with reluctance he rose from his seat: And resigning his nails and his fame for retreat; Two weeks his new life he admir'd and enjoy'd: The third he with plenty and quiet was cloy'd. To live undistinguish'd to him was the pain, An existence unnoticed he could not sustain. In retirement he sigh'd for the fame-giving chair; For the crowd to admire him, to rev'rence and stare: No endearments of pleasure and ease could prevail; He the saintship resumed, and new larded his tail. Our Fakeer represents all the vot'ries of fame; Their ideas, their means, and their end is the same. The sportsman, the buck; all the heroes of vice, With their gallantry, lewdness, the bottle and dice; The poets, the critics, the metaphysicians, The courtier, the patriot, all politicians; The statesman begirt with th' importunate ring, (I had almost completed my list with the king) All labour alike to illustrate my tale; All tortured by choice with th' invisible nail. AN ELEGY WRITTEN IN AN EMPTY ASSEMBLY-ROOM. ? Semperque relinqui Sola sibi ? Virg. [FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1756.] In scenes where Hallet's genius has combined With Bromwich to amuse and cheer the mind; Amid this pomp of cost, this pride of art, What mean these sorrows in a female heart? Ye crouded walls, whose well enlightened round With lovers sighs and protestations sound, Ye pictures flatter'd by the learn'd and wise, Ye glasses ogled by the brightest eyes, Ye cards, which beauties by their touch have blest, Ye chairs, which peers and ministers have prest, How are ye chang'd! like you my fate I moan, Like you, alas! neglected and alone— For ah! to me alone no card is come, I must not go abroad—and cannot be at home. Blest be that social power, the first who pair'd The erring footman with th' unerring card. 'Twas Venus sure; for by their faithful aid The whisp'ring lover meets the blushing maid; From solitude they give the cheerful call To the choice supper, or the sprightly ball; Speed the soft summons of the gay and fair, From distant Bloomsbury to Grosvenor Square; And bring the colonel to the tender hour, From the Parade, the Senate, or the Tower. Ye records, patents of our worth and pride! Our daily lesson, and our nightly guide! Where'er ye stand disposed in proud array, The vapours vanish, and the heart is gay; But when no cards the chimney-glass adorn, The dismal void with heart-felt shame we mourn; Conscious neglect inspires a sullen gloom, And brooding sadness fills the slighted room. If but some happier female's card I've seen, I swell with rage, or sicken with the spleen; While artful pride conceals the bursting tear, With some forced banter or affected sneer: But now grown desp'rate, and beyond all hope, I curse the ball, the duchess and the pope. The duchess of Norfolk, who was a catholic. And as the loads of borrow'd plate go by, “Tax it! ye greedy ministers,” I cry. How shall I feel, when Sol resigns his light To this proud splendid goddess of the night! Then, when her aukward guests in measure beat The crouded floors, which groan beneath their feet! What thoughts in solitude shall then possess My tortur'd mind, or soften my distress! Not all that envious malice can suggest Will soothe the tumults of my raging breast. (For envy's lost amidst the numerous train, And hisses with her hundred snakes in vain) Though with contempt each despicable soul Singly I view,—I must revere the whole. The methodist in her peculiar lot, The world forgetting, by the world forgot, Though single happy, tho' alone is proud, She thinks of heav'n (she thinks not of a crowd) And if she ever feels a vap'rish qualm, Some The title of a book of devotion. Drop of Honey, or some holy balm, The pious prophet of her sect distils, And her pure soul seraphic rapture fills; Grace shines around her with serenest beams, And whisp'ring Whitf?d prompts her golden dreams. Far other dreams my sensual soul employ, While conscious nature tastes unholy joy: I view the traces of experienced charms, And clasp the regimentals in my arms. To dream last night I clos'd my blubber'd eyes; Ye soft illusions, dear deceits arise: Alas! no more; methinks I wand'ring go To distant quarters 'midst the Highland snow, To the dark inn where never wax-light burns, Where in smoak'd tap'stry faded Dido mourns; To some assembly in a country town, And meet the colonel—in a parson's gown!! I start—I shriek— O! could I on my waking brain impose, Or but forget at least my present woes! Forget 'em—how!—each rattling coach suggests The loath'd ideas of the crouding guests. To visit—were to publish my disgrace; To meet the spleen in ev'ry other place; To join old maids and dowagers forlorn; And be at once their comfort and their scorn! For once to read—with this distemper'd brain, Ev'n modern novels lend their aid in vain. My Mandoline—what place can music find Amid the discord of my restless mind? How shall I waste this time which slowly flies! How lull to slumber my reluctant eyes! This night the happy and th' unhappy keep Vigils alike,—NORFOLK has murder'd sleep. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A DISAPPOINTED CANDIDATE AND HIS FRIEND. WHY in sorrow, my friend, who were always so gay? Have you had any cross, any losses at play? Whence arises this gloom, this uncommon dejection? Are you jilted in love? Candidate. I have lost my election. On Sir Politic's family-interest I stood: Five hundred, he swore they were steady and good— Had faithfully promised, nay four had subscribed, But the day of the poll ev'ry scoundrel was bribed. Two months have I led this damn'd canvassing life, Cajoling some rustic or speeching his wife. Plagued, surfeited, poison'd, and harass'd, I'm grown, Wan, meagre, dejected, and mere skin and bone. This sure was enough, but at last to be beat— Had this trouble and plague but procured me a seat.— Friend. Prithee sit thee down here, and these vanities end: And be proud of a seat in the house of a friend: Which no art can obtain and no brib'ry procure: Which true worth, sense, and virtue, alone can insure. Candidate. But while virtue lies buried in mere speculation, Who must act for the public, who care for the nation? Tho' I pay due regard to the title of friend, Yet the cares of a patriot must further extend; To his country his present, his posthumous fame; And 'tis bus'ness alone can ennoble his name. Friend. That true fame is the offspring of action 'tis granted, But a thousand are busy for one that is wanted: This business, we boast of, we daily create, From an itch to be meddling, important and great. But to polish our parts and our reason refine, Each art is a jewel: each science a mine. Candidate. All arts when compared with the art to persuade, Seem debased to some vile and mechanical trade: To soothe haughty man and his errors reform, Or by reason averting some popular storm, On the fortunes perhaps of a kingdom decide: These, these are my wishes; this should be my pride. So important a service, such merit, must bring Applause from my country; reward from my King. Friend. Should the Minister's jealousy check your ambition, What resource have you then? Candidate. What resource? Opposition. In the House I'd harangue, in the Country declaim, With my breath blow each popular spark to a flame. I'd pursue the mean wretch to the brink of disgrace; Unless duly appeased by some eminent place: For no honours, no titles, no ribbands I'd have, Let him deck with those trappings some indolent slave. Friend. And are there no charms but in place and employment? No private delights, no domestic enjoyment? Are the cares for your kindred, your parent, or race, When compared with the public so sordid and base? Love, friendship, philosophy, learning, and mirth, Tho' despised, can they lose their intrinsical worth? Now reading, composing, discourse, meditation, Are all terms of contempt or at best out of fashion. But tho' fame in this age is to bus'ness confined, Retirement's the test of true greatness of mind. Let reflection divert you from placing your joys In vain ostentation, in hurry and noise; Let the good and the virtuous your merits spread forth, In the permanent tribute to personal worth. VERSES OCCASIONED BY THE MARRIAGE AND GAME ACT, BOTH PASSED THE SAME SESSION. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1753.] THE Parliament rose, and Miss Jenny came down To the seat in the country, quite sick of the town. She stroll'd all alone to partake the sweet air In the grove, with the nightingale, linnet, and hare. Oh! puss I rejoice beyond measure to meet My companion again in this happy retreat. I was sadly afraid—but no poacher will dare, From henceforward, be seen with a gun or a snare. While here I indulge a contemplative life You may skip to the sound of my pastoral fife. Then frisk it securely; for your preservation Is, at present, the principal care of the nation. Oh! Miss, quoth the hare, you are none of those friends Who in acting for others consult their own ends: But I fear, let me tell you, those associators Will be found to our kindred the worst of all traitors. 'Tis true they protect from the jaws of the clown The poor innocent game they devote to their own. And I fear, if some squeamish fantastical glutton Should turn up his nose at your beef or your mutton, Your father would order a hare to be shot, And, as chance might decree, your poor friend go to pot. Oh! brittle condition of friendship so frail, So rare to establish, so subject to fail! How plain to foresee my unfortunate end! Has the law any better secured me my friend? (The law which would never till now see a crime in The most private mysterious secrets of Hymen) By this Act you are safe from each amorous spark, From the Ensign, the Curate, the Butler, the Clerk; But the first booby 'Squire that shall knock at your gate, With a crack'd constitution and mortgaged estate, Shall transform (then adieu the poor pastoral life) The contemplative nymph to a mope of a wife: With your fortune redeem his confiscated lands, And your father the foremost to publish the banns. ON THE APPOINTMENT OF LORD TEMPLE TO BE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY. A Parody of Apollo's Speech to Phæton. Ovid. Metam. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1757.] HIS royal eye his royal foot survey'd, His left hand with the glitt'ring sword-knot play'd; At distance due the scarlet band appear, Who move by clock-work with the day and year. Nearer the youths in gaudy velvets drest; The fair with flow'rets crown'd and naked breasts; Autumnal fronts which various arts repair; And statesmen, reverend in their silver hair. Then Phæton his gracious Prince bespoke. O King! unless this change be all a joke, All Devonshire's invention, dream or sport, Confirm thy promise in this crouded court; Think not that vulgar token I demand, A rape committed on your royal hand, That common prostitute—but on thy life, O speak to me and whisper to my wife. Then thrice the monarch shook his anxious head; At length—Yes—I will speak to thee, he said. My fleet I give thee for my promise sake, But 'tis a promise I had rather break. O Phaeton! consider what you ask! Ev'n for a seaman what an arduous task! You're a mere landman, you was never hurl'd By rapid tempests round the rolling world. The charge you claim asks such experienced skill As not our cabinet combined could fill. Not ev'n our William, godlike in command, Who rolls his dreadful thunders o'er the land, On this uncertain element would dare— And which of you with William shall compare? Perhaps your Lordship, judging in your haste, Conceives the sea a place laid out in taste. Or, in a calenture, believes the main Umbrageous verdure and a flow'ry plain: Temples above and bridges all below— Perhaps you fancy 'tis another Stowe. Alas! th' insidious element you'll find By turns to calm, by turns to rage inclined. Weigh well the storms in each tempestuous sea, The restless roll of the Biscayan bay. There treach'rous Dunkirk, and Saint Malo's here, Alike conceal the lurking privateer. In southern seas the uncertain power of Spain, In northern, dread the more uncertain Dane; Your islands now th' adventurous French invade, Now prey with ease on your defenceless trade. Besides a seaman is a stubborn thing, Much worse to rule than a submissive king. Judge not by me of this rebellious crew, Trust me, my Lord, they more resemble you. Yet merchants clam'ring at the chance of war, Are louder than the patriot or the tar. Nor think I want my promise to evade, When only this department I dissuade. Honours, preferments, freely chuse the best, And call promotion from the East or West; Thy choice in Ireland, or the Indias make, And thence a government or pension take. Whate'er you ask you surely shall obtain, But to ask wisely you must ask again. AGAINST INCONSTANCY; ADDRESSED TO THE EARL OF ?. NEVER tell me, my Lord, of the pleasures of change, Nor inveigle from home my reluctance to range; I plead guilty, variety's vot'ry profest, By none more than myself her delights are confest; But to ask where she's found would some judgments perplex, In each woman we find her, but not in the sex. Whatever their breeding, their rank, or their name, In themselves only various, the sex are the same. A wife, by your looks, you would tell me grows old, Oft unsightly in shape, and she may be a scold: But possest of the charms which your senses delude, In the nat'ral coquet, or unnatural prude, You may flatter yourself all the days of your life, And you've only obtain'd, what you loath in a wife. Then invite me no more, my kind tempter, to range, Like for like is no gain; I shall lose if I change. TO Mr. WHITEHEAD, ON HIS BEING MADE POET LAUREAT. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1758.] 'TIS so—tho' we're surpriz'd to hear it: The laurel is bestow'd on merit. How hush'd is ev'ry envious voice, Confounded by so just a choice! Tho' by prescriptive right prepared To libel the selected bard. But as you see the statesman's fate In this our democratic state, Whom virtue strives in vain to guard From the rude pamphlet and the card; You'll find the demagogues of Pindus In envy not a jot behind us: For each Aonian politician, Whose element is opposition, Will shew how greatly they surpass us, In gall and wormwood at Parnassus. Thus as the same detracting spirit Attends on all distinguish'd merit, When 'tis your turn, observe, the quarrel Is not with you, but with the laurel. Suppose that laurel on your brow For cypress changed, funereal bough; See all things take a diff'rent turn! The very critics sweetly mourn, And leave their satire's pois'nous sting, In plaintive elegies to sing: With solemn threnody and dirge Conduct you to Elysium's verge. At Westminster the surpliced dean The sad but honourable scene Prepares. The well-attended hearse Bears you amid the kings of verse. Each rite observ'd, each duty paid, Your fame on marble is display'd, With symbols which your genius suit, The mask, the buskin, and the flute: The laurel crown aloft is hung: And o'er the sculptured lyre unstrung Sad allegoric figures leaning— (How folks will gape to find their meaning!) And a long epitaph is spread, Which happy You will never read. But hold—the change is so inviting, I own, I tremble while I'm writing. Yet, Whitehead, 'tis too soon to lose you; Let critics flatter or abuse you: O! teach us, ere you change the scene To Stygian banks from Hippocrene, How free-born bards should strike the strings, And how a Briton write to kings. EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT DRURY-LANE THEATRE, BY MISS POPE, IN THE Character of Miss Notable, in the Lady's Last Stake: 1760. YES—I'm resolv'd—I'll live and die a Maid. Expos'd! and jeer'd! abandon'd and betray'd! Such usage!—monstrous—bear it those who can, Here—I renounce that faithless creature—Man. Sooner in cells and nunneries I'll hide The just resentment of my injur'd pride, Than tame and quiet stay another minute In this vile world—and not—make mischief in it. For ever leave the world!—That's not the worst— To be a nun—one must be papist first. To change religion and beyond sea roam— But—one may be a methodist at home. Hold! to be qualify'd for that, they say, The hopeful convert first must—go astray. 'Tis, I've been told, a blessed situation— But then—I loathe the odious preparation. What! can one then devise no kind of plan, Without this necessary evil, Man! Can woman singly find herself no station? Sinner or saint must be by his creation! Why, faith, without him—nothing can be done: One can—I think—be nothing—but a Nun. Whatever woman's vanity may boast, He makes the peeress—and He makes the toast. Her last best title—she from him derives— For—to be widows—we must first be wives. To this hard fate is every maiden born: We can not have the rose without the thorn. —Then—I give up the world and all its folly, For solitude and musing melancholy. Oh! how I long to quit this empty dream, And fix some sober plan, some lasting scheme!— 'Twill soon be settled when I've once begun it.— I'll go to Ranelagh—and think upon it. EPILOGUE SPOKEN AT DRURY-LANE THEATRE, BY MISS PRITCHARD, In the Character of Maria in the Tamer tamed: 1760. WELL! since I've thus succeeded in my plan, And conquer'd this all-conquering tyrant, man, To farther conquests still my soul aspires, And all my bosom glows with martial fires. Suppose—a female regiment we raise— We must—for men grow scarceish now-a-days, Now every man of spirit is enlisted— Why, ladies—these brave lads should be assisted. The glorious scheme my flutt'ring heart bewitches: But hold—I've promis'd not to wear the breeches. No matter—in this variegated army We'll find some regimentals that shall charm ye. If plumes and lace recruiting can persuade, We'll try to shew our taste in masquerade. My feather here is fitted in a trice: Then for the crest, the motto, and device— Death's head and bones!—No—we'll have flames and darts! In Latin mottos men may shew their parts, But ours shall be true English—like our hearts. Our uniform we'll copy from the Greek; The drapery and emblems true antique: Minerva's ægis! and Diana's bow!— And thus equipt to India's coasts we'll go. Temples of gold, and diamond mines we'll rob: —And every month we'll make a new Nabob. Amid this glorious scene of contributions, Spoil, presents—hourly change and revolutions, While high on stately elephants we ride, Whose feet can trample European pride, Think not our country we can e'er forget: We'll plunder—but to pay the nation's debt. Then there's America—we'll soon dispatch it, This tedious war—when we take up the hatchet. Heroes and soldiers Indian wiles may catch; But—in a woman they may meet their match. To art, disguise, and stratagem no strangers, We fear no hazard, nor once think of dangers In our true character of Female Rangers. A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SIR RICHARD LYTTELTON AND THE THAMES. In Imitation of Horace, B. 3. Ode 9. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1763.] Sir Richard. WHILE fondly I triumph'd alone in your breast, And none else to your bosom so closely you prest, No monarch on earth was so happy as I: I envy'd no king of a land that was dry. Thames. While you on my banks was contented to stray, With the days and the months I roll'd glibly away. Nor envy'd I then ('tis no treason I hope) The Tweed her lord Bute, or the Tiber her Pope. Sir Richard. Piccadilly, it must be confest, has its charms: By the prospect allured I deserted your arms: Tho' the cielings were damp and the walls hardly dry, I'd have gone there tho' Burroughs had sworn I should die. Thames. Your neighbour, Sir Charles, has employ'd ev'ry art With resistless allurements to ravish my heart. To gaze on his charms with delight I could stay From morning to night, from December to May. Sir Richard. Should your lover prove false and abandon your shore, Rebuilding his house where 'twas founded before? Should I, loaded with picture and statue and urn, To present you the spoils of the Tiber, return? Thames. Tho' inconstant in thought you should often be stealing To your loved Piccadilly, or even to Ealing: Your walls would I clasp in my amorous arms, And swell with delight to contemplate your charms. TO OZIAS HUMPHRY, Esq. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1777.] WE find, in the annals of famed Richmond Hill, That each touch of the pencil makes work for the quill. In the morning a picture is shewn by Patoun: William Patoun, Esq. who resided on Richmond Hill, a gentleman eminent for his skill in painting, who had lately finish'd a fine picture of Cleopatra. A volume of poems is publish'd at noon. With all the bright tints that the palette affords Cleopatra is drawn. With the choicest of words That bards of all ranks may contribute to deck her, The Treas'ry Sir Grey Cooper, Secretary to the Treasury. completes what's begun by th' Exchequer. Lord Hardwicke, one of the Tellers of the Exchequer. But, Humphry, by whom shall your labours be told, How your colours enliven the young and the old? And was it for this you indulged in your freak, To excel all the moderns and rival th' antique, On sublime Saint Gotardo to venture your neck? No poet d'ye find to extol your design, The glow of your tints, or the grace of your line? With lofty Parnassus proud Richmond may vie, And spout ev'ry hour her bright streams to the sky. Are the founts of the vallies exhausted and dry? Then we'll cull from their borders the flow'rs of the mead To present you a wreath not unworthy your head. The swans of sweet Thames their best quills shall afford Your genius, your talent, your life to record; And shall not your Sheridan give you an ode, To describe ancient Rome and the charms of the road, With the taste you acquired in that learned abode? From that learned abode shall Corilla pour forth Her extempore lays to acknowledge your worth. From more distant Elysium your Goldsmith shall tell his Old friends at the club how you're praised by Apelles. How Zeuxis admires you, how Raphael fears: How the ancients and moderns are all by the ears: What zeal old Protogenes shews in your service: How he treats the great Titian no better than Jervis: How Proserpine lately was chuckling to think She had just caught you napping on Phlegeton's brink: (No mortal since Orpheus her fancy could taste And only your pencil his lyre had surpast.) How she longs to possess you by force or by stealth. —Now your danger you know—so take care of your health. Mr. WILKES'S SOLILOQUY, THE DAY BEFORE HIS ELECTION FOR CHAMBERLAIN OF LONDON: A PARODY on Cæsar's Speech in the Boat. LUCAN'S PHARSALIA, Lib. 5. l. 559. THUS far my bark has found a prosp'rous gale, And though in this my last attempt I fail, I've done enough. Scotland has felt my pen, Has felt and trembled in her darkest den. Horne I've subdued, and Sawbridge to his shame Is but my second in the lists of fame. I've taught the mob the senate to defeat, And, spite of rule and order, kept my seat. Of pow'r and profit I've enjoy'd my share, Trustee, Receiver, Treasurer, Lord Mayor. And since by these proud titles made so great That Charon's boat shall groan beneath my weight, What is't to me if 'tis ordain'd my lot, Unburied with some creditor to rot, I'll still have wine and women whilst alive, For Christian burial let the vulgar strive. My corse let bailiffs seize or surgeons tear, My spirit the surviving world shall fear. ON PAINTING; ADDRESSED TO Mr. PATCH, A CELEBRATED PICTURE CLEANER. THY pen in haste, Thalia, snatch, To sing of Titian and Carach,— Bassan, and Tintoret—and Patch. 'Tis Exeter demands Mr. Patch was at that time employed in cleaning the pictures at Burleigh. the strain; Shall Burleigh's master ask in vain? Burleigh, the place where every Muse Her favourite elegance may chuse. For there the Romans and Venetians Display a shew, which all the Grecians, Whate'er ingenious Webb may say,— Could ne'er have equall'd in their day. Protogenes and famed Apelles— The story well enough to tell is, How one could colour, t'other draw— But were their colours warm or raw? Why nothing now remains to show it, Except the historian and the poet. And shall we trust that wanton tribe Who all, with fancy's pen describe. No Patch.—but had thy healing hand Been present in Achaia's land, Their art divine had now been known, Their tints in all their lustre shone. Honours divine you must have shared, A mortal with the gods compared. Did Grecian god or Romish saint E'er match the wonders of thy paint? In miracles you far excel 'em.— How shall the Muse attempt to tell 'em? When human forms displease your taste, Ill drawn, ill colour'd, or ill placed; Or when unskilful hand has hurt 'em, To rock or fountain you convert 'em— Make Niobe marble, Battus touchstone, (Salvator never painted such stone) Or change, like Jove, to bull or swan, Ill moulded horse or graceless man. Turn we from poets to the church? You leave all fiction in the lurch, Tho' beads and reliques oft have fail'd, Your pencil ever has prevail'd. The holy head of Januarius Oft in effect has proved precarious; Nor has the thundering mountain stopt Its lava, tho' his blood has dropt. But you at once can make it still, Or run on either side the hill. Your art miraculous the same, Administer'd to blind or lame. You cure the darkest drop serene: Give eyes to see and to be seen. Heal the poor martyr flay'd and rackt, Shrivel'd and scorcht, and torn and hackt. Restore the decollated head, Revive the dying and the dead. Your charity you ne'er withhold From bodies naked, raw or cold; And when you find an arm or shape awry, Hide the defect with flowing drapery. When wanton Eve and carnal Adam, Drunk with that fruit their God forbad 'em, Lie at their length, in fond embraces, With bodies naked as their faces, You cover Adam's limbs and Eve's With thick festoons of flowers and leaves; So draw the eyes of every prude, To weep the children in the wood. Where'er you see ungracious Ham, Bent to disclose his father's shame; And, spite of modest Shem and Japhet, Persist the boozy sire to laugh at, You aid the pious brother's cares: Your delicacy suits with theirs. So when each over-curious elder, (As if to look for Hans-en-kelder) Tugs hard, with trembling hand, to lift The folds of chaste Susanna's shift; If Time, whose trick is to discover, As much as any tatling lover, Should make a third with these unfolders, And leave her bare to all beholders; A veil, by your propitious art, White and unspotted as her heart, O'er the much-injured matron hung, Shall shield her from the censuring tongue. Alcides's ill-directed wife, Gave him a shirt, which cost his life: You gave his Omphale a shift, Which proves a better-fated gift, It sits so gracefully upon her, And recommends her to his Honour The Master of the Rolls, for whom he had cleaned a picture, and given some drapery to the figure of Omphale.. But be it still your greatest praise, From dull obscurity to raise, From all those evils that assault 'em, From gums, from oils, from deadly spaltum; And give to works almost divine, Once more in native tints to shine. Then I, like Newton's Vide the Inscription on Newton's Monument in Westminster Abbey. bard, may write, Patch waved his brush, and all was light. ON SEEING THE HEAD OF Sir ISAAC NEWTON, Richly gilt, and placed by a celebrated Optician upon the top of a certain Temple, in a conspicuous part of his Garden on Richmond Hill. RESOLVED to rescue Newton's bust From dull obscurity and dust, Or the vile purpose of a sign, And give the demigod a shrine; First o'er his venerable head The most resplendent gold I spread: This obvious and apparent hint Bespeaks him master of the mint Sir Isaac Newton was master of the mint. Next (that the hero might be placed To shew his genius and my taste) An insulated building's top Affords his contemplation scope. No walls his active eye t'imprison; No trees to intercept th' horizon; Prevent the planets path to trace, And speculate on time and space. Here be he fixt till restless love Of knowledge instigates to move, To depths where nature gives to view Her treasures to the chosen few. For as he proves that all things tend By their own nature to descend, He, by the laws of gravitation, May gain a more convenient station, From whence his all-exploring eye, In nature's secrets best may pry. There undiscover'd yet, may find The hidden origin of wind: And, traced from their mysterious source, Detect the fountains in their course; With curious observation, mark well How gushing waters foam and sparkle; Compare their lustre as they pass With hues of the prismatic glass: Till, yielding now to his enquiries, The yet impenetrable Iris, Shall all the various colours shew, That decorate her wond'rous bow. TO A LADY WHO WAS VERY HANDSOME, AND HAD ASKED THE AUTHOR HIS OPINION OF THE WITCH OF ENDOR. Dear Madam, You honoured me with your commands to give you the most complete idea of the Witch of Endor;—I can find no way to do it so exactly, as by recommending to you to look in the glass. You will see by this how much I am, Your devoted humble Servant, R. O. Cambridge. A CURIOUS lady bids me send her, My notions of the Witch of Endor; And I her person to describe well, Shall trust to nothing but the Bible. For little shall I mind Delany, Who only writes to entertain ye. Much less the poet or the painter, Who both with age and wrinkles taint her, While each for half-a-crown would saint her. But I, who from my earliest youth Have never writ or spoke but truth, Will shew her merits from the Scripture, Of which they wantonly have stripp'd her. There you will find no word of her age But much of her address and courage; Who when she saw the dastard Saul So weaken'd by his fright and fall, Dismay'd with grissly ghost of saint, With vapours and with hunger faint; She would not do him good by half, So baked her bread and kill'd her calf, The time was short; the bread was hot; No yeast or leaven to be got. The veal, tho' fat, could not be tender.— —But for the gen'rous Maid of Endor, Adorn'd with each engaging quality To ornament her hospitality, Good sense, good humour, truly rich in, It must be own'd she was bewitching. A PARODY OF ACHILLES' SPEECH, POPE'S HOMER, BOOK FIRST, LINE 309. Occasioned by the Author hearing of a Clergyman, who, in a violent fit of Anger, threw his Wig into the Fire, and turned his Son out of Doors. “NOW by this sacred perriwig I swear, “Which never more shall locks or ringlets bear, “Which never more shall form the smart toupee, “Forced from it's parent head,—(as thou from me); “Once 'twas live hair; now form'd by th' Artist's hand, “It aids the labours of the sacred band; “Adds to the Vicar's brow a decent grace, “And pours a glory round his rev'rend face. “By this I swear, when thou shalt ask again “My doors to enter, thou shalt ask in vain.” He spoke, and furious with indignant ire Hurl'd the vast hairy texture on the fire; Then sternly silent sate—the active flame Remorseless wastes the soft and tender frame: Writhed to and fro consumes the tortured hair, And lost in smoke attenuates to air. A PARODY ON “DEATH AND THE LADY;” In a Dialogue between Lord North and Lord Sandwich: Written extempore, and occasioned by Lord Sandwich's exaggerated praise of that composition, and his defying Mr. Cambridge, in a large company, to produce any thing of equal merit. [WRITTEN ABOUT THE YEAR 1780.] LORD NORTH. PROUD lord of fleets, lay your commission down, And walk a private man about the town. I now resume the shining post I gave ye, And you no more must lord it o'er the navy. LORD SANDWICH. What bold attempt is this; will you, my lord, Presume to threat or move me from my board? Must I, lord Sandwich, yield to your decree, Because you're bigger round the waist than me? LORD NORTH. Reply not to me with a catch-club jest, And know the man with whom you dare contest. Play not with my superior pow'r and worth; My rank is Premier, and my name is North. LORD SANDWICH. Thy power and worth are not to me unknown; But still I think more highly of my own: For while the Fleet is my peculiar care, I awe the French, the Spaniard, and Lord Mayor. LORD NORTH. Great is your power, but greater my command; You press the City; but I tax the Land; And, as my various Features smile or pout, So sure this man comes in, and that goes out. LORD SANDWICH. The brave with tyrant ministers contests; Instead of speeches now I'll write protests; Call back the thunderstruck seceding crew, Instead of going out, I'll turn out you. LORD NORTH. Call not for them, their skill will never do, They know what 'tis to starve; and so shall you. I'll hear no more, I'm summon'd by the King; And so—you may protest, or speak, or sing. AN INVITATION TO A BALL AT LADY COOPER'S: WRITTEN BY SIR GREY COOPER, 1781; And occasioned by Mr. Cambridge having spoken in Admiration of the Duchess of Devonshire. EVER a just and elegant Spectator Of beauty, grace, and all the charms of nature, Your moral wit with Addison might share The trust of Guardian to the British fair: With you conversing with delight we feel You could with perfect ease out Tatler Steele: You've writ the best things in the World, and sure Your taste surpasses far the Connoisseur: A Rambler too you've been, and like the Bee, Gather'd sweet spoils from ev'ry flow'r and tree. At last you turn Adventurer, and fly Too near the flame of Devonshire's bright eye. That charming flame whose animating ray Would tempt e'en Dædalus to soar astray: Again your wings to burn you seem t' aspire; You are no child, and do not dread the fire. But, ah! beware the fable's fatal end, And e'er too late take caution from a friend: Come hither with your Icarus and try A flight together in our middle sky; That region has its stars; tho' not so bright, They shed a milder and a safer light. ANSWER. You've dress'd me out in borrow'd rags and tatters Of Ramblers, Guardians, Tatlers, and Spectators; You've given me wings to fly from pole to pole, “With thoughts beyond the reaches of my soul.” To claims like these I've not the least pretence, Resume them all, and grant me Common Sense. Another periodical paper, which Sir Grey omitted. THE PROGRESS OF LIBERTY. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1790.] WHAT progress does Liberty make ev'ry week! How quick from Versailles has she reach'd Martinique! And so soon will her power all the Indies subdue, We shall see her dominion extend to Peru; For now to her standard so great the resort is, Her conquests she's spreading much quicker than Cortez. At the rate she goes on, she will soon be possest Of all hearts that too long have been slaves in the West. Then Eastward she'll bend—'tis but crossing the ocean— And she'll put the Poissardes of Morocco in motion. Now, turning Algiers, and the kingdoms piratical, Into popular boroughs and states democratical; In Egypt, a new constitution and laws Shall end the contention, of Beys and Bashaws. But how shall she pass by the strict Dardanelle? How teach such inveterate slaves to rebel? How impress on the children of predestination Those maxims which tend to such strange reformation? That tyranny turn to a free common-weal, To états-généreaux, and a hotel-de-ville? How make the Vizier such a poor renegade, As to change his three tails for a Christian cockade? Should Constantinople embrace the idea, Sure nothing will easier yield than Crimea; For we know that the mighty Tartarian Cham, Submitted to Russia, as meek as a lamb! Content to resign on the very first notice, Bag and baggage he sail'd o'er the Palus Mæotis. From the Crim', the divinity lands at Oczakow, Then hey! for her favourite Veto at Cracow! If she meet, in her road, hyperborean Kate, She may chance to persuade that sublime autocrate, 'Ere she quits this vain world, to adopt her opinions, And present her to all her extensive dominions. Now in haste over Sweden and Denmark she wanders, To see how her pupils are acting in Flanders. From thence to Great Britain she travels with speed, And, perch'd on the pillar in famed Runnymead, She surveys the whole island, and finds it in awe Of no pow'r upon earth, but of justice and law; With no wrongs to redress, and no rights to restore; She has all she can wish, and she asks for no more. ON SEEING THIS MOTTO TO A FRENCH PAPER: “DULCE ET DECORUM EST PRO PATRIA MORI.” [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1793.] TO die for one's country, I grant is decorum, To establish the rights of mankind or restore 'em. But I first must be sure of my facts ere I full see That the fate of the bleeding Parisians is dulce. Most men with poor Agag agree that 'tis “bitter,” And for Frenchmen I find 'tis an epithet fitter. Have they died like the heroes of Rome or of Greece? No.—They suffer their fate from another's caprice. And when not in the humour to die, they are martyr'd; So, without their consent, they are hang'd, drawn, and quarter'd. As a tax it is frequently levied; but no man Has made a free gift of his life like a Roman. Their zealous compatriots have saved them the labour; Each man is so busy in hanging his neighbour. Which has made the mere mob such expert undertakers, By performing the funeral rites of the Bakers. To die, in fine language, is noble and specious, But who dies like a Paulus, ? Animæque magnæ Prodigum Paulum. Hor. a Curtius or Decius, Devoted for Rome? or the Theban Menæcius—edito oraculo largitus est patriæ suum sanguinem. Cicero Tusc. Menæcius? Let me see such examples of virtue, before I Acknowledge 'tis dulce pro patria mori. But lest you should think that I talk like a tory, Of Livy and Tacitus read the history: Examine the tales which they tell for their glory, And you'll find that of France a quite different story. TO A FRIEND WHO WAS A GREAT ASTRONOMER, Recommending the Bearer as a proper Person to take Care of his Cows. OLD Ovid tells, (as I and you know,) A tale of Jupiter and Juno: She, jealous hussy, thought her cows Were fatal to his marriage vows; And, swallowing ev'ry's gossip's lies, Beset him with the strangest spies: Old Argus with his hundred eyes. With two he slept, and watch'd with four; The rascal ogled with a score.— Well, but to leave the ancient story, How is it in the case before ye? Your rooted passion for your cows, Disturbs the quiet of your spouse: This youth, I prophecy, she'll find A faithful Argus to her mind; Whose vigilance and care supplies The want of number in his eyes. While you, so practised to survey, Thro' Storer's A celebrated Optician. glass, the milky way, Shall there find out a proper station, To form a splendid constellation; When you and Joe, your wife and cow, Shall leave your dairy here below. A FREE TRANSLATION OF BOILEAU; Epist. 1. l. 61. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1801.] THUS of Pyrrhus, enquired his old Tutor and friend: These elephants, soldiers, and ships, to what end? Pyr. To the siege; for I've oft' been invited to come, And with glory to conquer all-conquering Rome. Tut. I agree that great glory from thence would ensue, And 'tis worthy alone Alexander or you. After such an exploit, there's no more to be done.— Pyr. Yes—the countries that border on Rome must be won. Tut. Any more? Pyr. Don't you see Syracuse is so near. Tut. Any more? Pyr. Give me that, and to Carthage I steer. Tut. Now I see, you're resolved to be master of all, The near, and the distant, the great and the small; And I plainly perceive you will not be at rest, Till you've tried all the East, when you've conquer'd the West. So Egypt is yours. Your Ambition then ranges, And bears you away to the Tigris and Ganges. But when crown'd with success and with glory you tire us, What's left to be done, when return'd to Epirus? Pyr. Why to feast on good cheer, and good liquor to quaff; And, forgetting our labours, to sit down and laugh. Tut. Then why should we travel to Egypt and Rome? Who forbids us to laugh without stirring from home? EPIGRAMS. 1. [THUS Flavia exclaim'd, when beholding the coffin] ID CINEREM AUT MANES CREDIS curare SEPULTOS. Virg. THUS Flavia exclaim'd, when beholding the coffin, Which her dear loving spouse to the Abbey went off in; “And why might not I, like the Braminy dames, “Leap to his dear arms, through the midst of the flames; “Here, Jenny, go send for a load of dry faggots,;— “But hold!—They may say these are whimsies or maggots. “Would it give his dear manes the smallest concern? “Would his ashes be much discomposed in their urn? “If I say with St. Paul “Better marry than burn.” 2. ON MEETING AT MR. GARRICK'S An Author very shabbily drest in an old velvet Waistcoat, on which he had sewed Embroidery of a later date. Three waistcoats, in three distant ages born, The bard with faded lustre did adorn. The first in velvet's figured pride surpast; The next in 'broidery; in both the last. His purse and fancy could no further go, To make a third he join'd the former two. 3. QUIN'S DEATH. Thy death shall provide us a general treat, At this critical epoch all creatures shall eat. To thy tomb each voracious insect shall haste, In thine entrails to batten: luxurious repast! May the worm be full-gorged in thy liver and heart: May'st thou surfeit the grub with some delicate part: May the poet too dine, who adorns thee with verse, And drunk be the parson who prays by thy herse. And fat be the gander who feeds on thy grave. Bath Guide. The last line alludes to a story told of a clergyman, who disgraced himself and his profession by hard drinking, and who boasted, that at a supper after Thomson's funeral, he left Quin drunk under the table, whilst he was able to walk home. 4. ACTEON NO CUCKOLD. I ne'er can agree on The tale of Acteon, With a moral so much misapplied; As by wits who suppose, They may class him with those, Who have err'd in the choice of a bride. But Diana undrest, Was too tempting a jest, To be lost on so curious a wag; So the goddess in wrath Leap'd out of the bath, And turn'd the rash youth to a stag, 5. IMITATION OF SHAKSPEARE. There is a honey-moon in works of Taste, Which gazed on for awhile, grows full and splendid; But in the wane is wasting to obscurity, Shorn of its beams by wanton criticism, Or hourly fading through satiety. 6. THE HISTORIAN IN LOVE: AN IMPROMPTU, On the Author seeing his Daughter reading the Life of Mr. Gibbon, just after she had been assisting Lady Newdigate in a Charity for distressed Ribbon Weavers. Now Charlotte has done with the Newdigate ribbon, She gives all her leisure to luminous Gibbon, Who laments how in Oxford the colleges stunk Of mild ale, and the pipes of the indolent Monk. Then soon as the stripling grew up to a Man, He relates the reception he met at Lausanne. He begins with the learned and ends with the fair. —He saw, and he loved—'twas an object so rare, That all gifts she possest both of nature and art, And she offer'd her lover a virtuous heart. So he wish'd to go back to the Mountains to thank her, But he heard, in his absence, she'd married a banker This banker was Mons. Neckar, who supplanted the historian in the lady's affections during his absence.. 7. OCCASIONED BY THE CONDUCT OF THE FRENCH TOWARDS THE POPE IN THE YEAR 1794. In times of old, at War's imperious call, England has oft “Robb'd Peter to pay Paul.” France, her enormous reck'ning to defray, Peter has robb'd, but Paul will never pay. 8. ON SEEING A DECENT-LOOKING YOUNG WOMAN COME DOWN A STAIRCASE IN CLEMENT'S-INN: A Parody of Jane Shore's Speech. Act 1st. Scene the last. Yes! Man, that lawless libertine, may sin In ev'ry corner of St. Clement's-Inn. But Woman! if she clamber in the dark The vice-worn staircase of some lawyer's clerk, A writ of error blots her spotless name; A habeas corpus ever damns her fame. 9. TO A YOUNG FRIEND, Who complained of one Relation who gave late Breakfasts on account of long Prayers,—and of another who gave bad Dinners. Our ghostly guides, to Heav'n who point the way, Enjoin this golden precept—Fast and Pray. How well, O pious youth, thy days are pass'd, Who pray with Sanctus and with Parcus fast. 10. LINES GIVEN EXTEMPORE To Doctor Monsey, Physician to Chelsea Hospital, Upon his expressing Surprize that the Scribleriad was not more known and talked of. Dear doctor, did you ever hear I had So piqued myself on the Scribleriad, That every pensioner of Chelsea, The learning and the wit should well see; Enough for me if only one see, But let that one be doctor Monsey. 11. THE FOLLOWING FRENCH LINES Being put into Mr. Cambridge's Hand, by a Friend who seemed somewhat too partial to this species of French Writing, he was induced to translate them, for the Sake of introducing the two concluding Lines, which expose the false Wit, and give a just Ridicule to the Idea of dying for Love. Each shepherd falls a victim to your eye, Thrill'd by your notes the birds for envy die; Henceforth in deserts must you sing alone, When all the lovers and the bards are gone. Yet some blind bard may strike the social string; And a deaf nightingale in safety sing. 12. A NOTE TO THE AUTHOR. At Church, or at Bushy, your sabbath d'ye spend. Your mind to regale or your morals to mend? If the former, I leave you the Devil to cheat; If the latter, I beg to have part of the treat. HIS ANSWER. Why your Lordship is now so impatient to search, If I'm passing my hours with the State or the Church, I was puzzled—but now I perceive, on the whole, So you get but my news, you don't care for my soul. 13. ON SEEING A TAPESTRY CHAIR-BOTTOM BEAUTIFULLY WORKED BY HIS DAUGHTER FOR MRS. HOLROYD. [WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1793.] While Holroyd may boast of her beautiful bottom, I think of what numberless ills may bespot 'em: 'Tis true they're intended for clean petticoats; But beware of th' intrusion of bold Sanculottes; Who, regardless of Charlotte's most elegant stitches, May rudely sit down without linen or breeches: Would you know from what quarter the mischief may come, When the batt'ry's unmask'd then beware of the bomb. 14. A TRANSLATION Of the following Epigram in the Eton collection. ??????????. ??? ??????????? ? ?????????? ????? ?? ????, ???, ?? ??????, ?????, ??????? ??, ???? ????; ??? ?? ? ??? ???????, ?????, ????, ????, ???????. ???? ?????? ???? ??? ????????, ???? ?????. As ? was stepping out of bed, A lurking Mouse he spies; And thus, alarm'd with sudden dread, Aloud to Tony cries: Tony make haste—the trap prepare— I see the rascal dodging.— Friend, quoth the Mouse, you need not fear, I come but for a lodging; Nor plant that dreadful engine there, To catch me by the neck fast; For surely I had ne'er come here, If I had wanted breakfast. The WORLD. [Ye sages say, who know mankind] Ye sages say, who know mankind, Whence, to their real profit blind, All leave those fields which might produce Fit game for pastime or for use? The table now remov'd, again Began Damœtas to complain; ‘I knew Eugenius in his prime, ‘The best companion of his time; ‘But since he's got to yonder board, ‘You never hear him speak a word, ‘But tiresome schemes of navigation, ‘The built of vessels and their station— ‘Such stuff as spoils all conversation.’ ‘Good Atticus, repeat the verses, ‘You lately said were made by Thyrsis.’ John at that instant introduces This very servant of the muses; Damœtas starts, and in confusion, Cursing the d?d ill-tim'd intrusion, Whispers the servant in his ear, ‘John, be so good to call a chair;’ And flies the spot, alarm'd with dread, Left Thyrsis should begin to read. And yet, for all he holds this rule, Damœtas is in fact no fool: For he would hardly chuse a groom To make his chairs or hang his room; Nor with th' upholsterer discourse About the glanders in his horse; Nor send to buy his wife a tête To Puddle-Dock or Billingsgate; Nor if in labour, spleen, or trance, Fetch her Sir Thomas for Sir Hans; Nor bid his coachman drive o' nights To parish-church instead of White's; Nor make his party or his bets With those who never pay their debts; Nor at dessert of wax and china Neglect the eatables, if any, To smell the chaplet in the middle, Or taste the Chelsea-china fiddle.</field>
