      <field name="fulltext">LETTERS Gallant &amp; Amorous. On the Author of a Dialogue concerning Women, pretended to be writ in defence of the Sex. Near Coven-Garden Theatre, where you know Poets their Sence, Players their Shapes do shew, There is a Clubb of Criticks of the Pit, Who do themselves admire for Men of Wit; And lo! an arbitrary Power assume On Plays and Ladies both to pass their Doom; Censure all things and Persons, Priest and Prince, And judge them by the Standard of their Sence: But scan these Sparks, or by their Words or Mien, You'll find them Fop without, and Fool within. One of these Brats dress'd up in shape of Satyr, Comes forth to be the Ladies Vindicator: And since for Chivalry he claims no Warrant, Instead of Knight sets up for Poet Errant. Bless us! said I, what mighty Hero's here? He thunders so, 'tis dangerous to come near. The beauteous Sex may set their Hearts at rest; Of all their Patrons, sure this is the best. This great dead-doing Champion of the Quill, Will all the Fry of lewd Lampooners kill; Then to begin with Dryden's dreadful Name, Shou'd mark out something of no common Fame. But when the boasted Matter I had read, I found my Expectation was misled, And that the Poet, though he does pretend To do them Justice, is no Woman's Friend. Misogynes is made to shoot with Ball, Philogynes allow'd no charge at all. And howsoever he disguise the matter, To publish the First Part, he writ the latter. He that but strictly marks the whole Design, May trace the Prefacer in every Line; And tho' he did not own the wanton Ape, He nurs'd the Cub, and lick'd it into shape. And, Ladies, now without the help of Day, You may discern who does the Weapon sway. And brandishes his Pen against your Credit; To Mr. Eat-finger himself that did it. He that sits silent in his Wits defence, Whose Mouth is fill'd with Fist instead of Sence; Or else he crams his Hand into his Jaws, Like Russian Bears that live upon their Paws. At Coffee-House among the Men of Worth, He goggles like a Quaker holding forth. Like an Endymion he can court the Moon, And bark at her bright Glories when h'as done; Or like the Mouse in Fable he can plead, He has deserv'd t'aspire to Princess Bed, 'Till for his daring Arrogance he's spurn'd, And all his fop-Pretensions over-turn'd. Then like the little Vermin squeaks and dies, Or prints a Book of Ladies Cruelties. This is the Fool, fair Ladies, that does haunt you, That will from Dressing-Room: o Play Gallant you. W? he is call'd; what Name so much renown'd, Through all the Realms of Nonsence can be found?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. To his Book. Go, little Book, and to the World impart The faithful Image of an am'rous Heart: Those who Love's dear, deluding Pains have known, May in my fatal Stories read their own. Those who have liv'd from all its Torments free, May find the thing they never felt, by me. Perhaps advis'd, avoid the gilded Bait, And, warn'd by my Example, shun my Fate. While with calm Joy, safe landed on the Coast, I view the Waves on which I once was tost. Love is a medley of Endearments, Jars, Suspicions, Quarrels, Reconcilements, Wars; Then Peace again. Oh! wou'd it not be best, To chase the fatal Poison from our Breast? But since so few can live from Passion free, Happy the Man, and only happy he, Who with such lucky Stars begins his love, That his cool Judgment does his Choice approve. Ill-grounded Passions quickly wear away; What's built upon Esteem, can ne'er decay. Elegy. The unrewarded Lover. Let the dull Merchant curse his angry Fate, And from the Winds and Waves his Fortune wait Let the loud Lawyer break his Brains, and be A Slave to wrangling Coxcombs for a Fee: Let the rough Souldier fight his Prince's Foes, And for a Livelihood his Life expose: I wage no War, I plead no Cause but Love's, I fear no Storms, but what Celinda moves. And what grave Censor can my Choice despise? But here, fair Charmer, here the diff'rence lies: The Merchant after all his Hazards past, Enjoys the fruit of his long Toils at last; The Soldier high in his King's Favour stands, And after having long obey'd, commands: The Lawyer to reward his tedious Care, Roars on the Bench, that babbled at the Barr; While I take pains to meet a Fate more hard, And reap no Fruit, no Favour, no Reward. Epigram. Written in a Lady's Table-Book. With what strange Raptures wou'd my Soul be blest, Were but her Book an Emblem of her Breast? As I from that all former Marks efface, And, uncontroul'd, put new ones in their place; So might I chase all others from her Heart, And my own Image in the stead impart. But, ah! how short the Bliss wou'd prove, if he Who seiz'd it next, might do the same by me. Elegy. The Power of Verse. To his Mistress. While those bright Eyes subdue where-e'er you will, And, as you please, can either save, or kill; What Youth so bold the Conquest to design? What Wealth so great to purchase Hearts like thine? None but the Muse that Privilege can claim, And what you give in Love, return in Fame. Riches and Titles with your Life must end; Nay, cannot even in Life your Fame defend: Verse can give Fame, can fading Beauties save, And, after Death, redeem'em from the Grave; Embalm'd in Verse, through distant Times they come, Preserv'd, like Bees, within an Amber Tomb. Poets, (like Monarchs, on an Eastern Throne, Restrain'd by nothing but their Will alone) Here can cry up, and there as boldly blame, And, as they please, give Infamy or Fame. In vain the Dido. Tyrian Queen resigns her Life, For the bright Glory of a spotless Wife, If lying Bards may false Amours rehearse, And blast her Name with arbitrary Verse. While Penelope. one who all the absence of her Lord, Had her wide Courts with pressing Lovers stor'd; Yet by a Poet grac'd, in deathless Rhimes, Stands a chaste Pattern to succeeding Times. With pity then the Muses Friends survey, Nor think your Favours there are thrown away; Wisely like Seed on fruitful Soil they're thrown, To bring large Crops of Glory and Renown. For as the Sun that in the Marshes breeds Nothing but nauseous and unwholesome Weeds; With the same Rays on rich and pregnant Earth, To pleasant Flowers, and useful Fruits gives birth. So Favours cast on Fools, get only Shame; On Poets shed, produce eternal Fame: Their gen'rous Breasts warm with a genial Fire, And more than all the Muses can inspire. Jealousie. I Who cou'd more happy, who more blest cou'd live, Than they whom kind, whom am'rous Passions move? What Crowns, what Empires greater Joys cou'd give, Than the soft Chains, the slavery of Love? Were not the Bliss too often crost, By that unhappy, vile Distrust; That gnawing Doubt, that anxious Fear, that dangerous Malady, That terrible tormenting Rage, that Madness Jealousie. II In vain Celinda boasts she has been true; In vain she swears she keeps untouch'd her Charms; Dire Jealousie does all my Pains renew, And represents her in my Rival's Arms. His Sighs I hear, his Looks I view, I see her damn'd Advances too; I see her smile, I see her kiss; and, oh! methinks I see Her give up all those Joys to him, she shou'd reserve for me. III Ingrateful fair One, canst thou hear my Groans? Canst thou behold these Tears that fill my Eyes? And yet unmov'd by all my Pains, my Moans, Into another's Arms resign my Prize? If Merit cou'd not gain your Love, My Sufferings might your Pity move: Might hinder you from adding thus, by jealous Frenzies, more New Pangs, to one whom hopeless Love had plagu'd too much before. IV Think not, false Nymph, my Fury to out-storm, I scorn your Anger, and despise your Frown: Dress up your Rage in its most hideous form, It will not move my Heart when Love is flown; No, tho' you from my Kindness fly, My Vengeance you shall satisfie; The Muse that wou'd have sung your Praise, shall now aloud proclaim To the malicious, spiteful World, your Infamy and Shame. V Ye Gods! she weeps; behold that falling Show'r! See how her Eyes are quite dissolv'd in Tears! Can she in vain that precious Torrent pour? Oh, no, it bears away my Doubts and Fears. 'Twas Pity sure that made it flow; For the same Pity stop it now: For every charming, heavenly Drop, that from those Eyes does part, Is paid with Streams of Blood, that gush from my o'er-flowing Heart. VI Yes, I will love; I will believe you true, And raise my Passions up as high as e'er; Nay, I'll believe you false, yet love you too, Let the least sign of Penitence appear. I'll frame Excuses for your Fault, Think you surpriz'd, or meanly caught; Nay, in the fury, in the heighth of that abhorr'd Embrace, Believe you thought; believe at least, you wish'd me in the place. VII Oh let me lie whole Ages in those Arms, And on that Bosom lull asleep my Cares: Forgive those foolish Fears of fansy'd Harms, That stab my Soul, while they but move thy Tears. And think unless I lov'd thee still, I had not treated thee so ill; For these rude Pangs of Jealousie, are much more certain signs Of Love, than all the tender Words an amorous Fancy coins. VIII Torment me with this horrid Rage no more; Oh, smile and grant one reconciling Kiss! Ye Gods, she's kind, I'm ecstasie all o'er! My Soul's too narrow to contain the Bliss. Thou pleasing Torture of my Breast, Sure thou wert fram'd to plague my Rest, Since both the Ill and Good you do, alike my Peace destroy; That kills me with excess of Grief, This with excess of Joy. Cure of Jealousie. What Tortures can there be in Hell, Compar'd to what fond Lovers feel, When doating on some fair One's Charms, They think she yields 'em to their Rivals Arms? As Lions tho' they once were tame, Yet if sharp Wounds their Rage enflame, Lift up their stormy Voices, roar, And tear the Keepers they obey'd before. So fares the Lover, when his Breast By jealous Frenzie is possest, Forswears the Nymph for whom he burns; Yet strait to her whom he forswears, returns. But when the Fair resolves his Doubt, The Love comes in, the Fear goes out; The Cloud of Jealousie's dispell'd, And the bright Sun of Innocence reveal'd. With what strange Rapture's is he blest! Raptures too great to be exprest. Tho' hard the Torment's to endure, Who wou'd not have the Sickness, for the Cure? Sonnet. Death. What has this Bugbear Death that's worth our Care? After a Life in Pain and Sorrow past, After deluding Hope and dire Despair, Death only gives us Quiet at the last. How strangely are our Love and Hate misplac'd! Freedom we seek, and yet from Freedom flee; Courting those Tyrant-Sins that chain us fast, And shunning Death, that only sets us free. 'Tis not a foolish fear of future Pains, (Why shou'd they fear who keep their Souls from Stains?) That makes me dread thy Terrors, Death, to see: 'Tis not the Loss of Riches, or of Fame, Or the vain Toys the Vulgar Pleasures name; 'Tis nothing, CÃ¦lia, but the losing thee. Elegy. To his false Mistress. CÃ¦lia, your Tricks will now no longer pass, And I'm no more the Fool that once I was. I know my happier Rival does obtain All the vast Bliss for which I sigh in vain. Him, him you love; to me you use your Art: I had your Looks, another had your Heart. To me y'are sick, to me of Spies afraid: He finds your Sickness gone, your Spies betray'd. I sigh beneath your Window all the Night; He in your Arms possesses the Delight. I know you treat me thus, false Fair, I do; And, oh! what plagues me worse, he knows it too: To him my Sighs are told, my Letters shown; And all my Pains are his Diversion grown. Yet since you cou'd such horrid Treasons act, I'm pleas'd you chose out him to do the Fact: His Vanity does for my Wrongs attone; And 'tis by that I have your Falshood known. What shall I do! for treated at this rate, I must not love; and yet I cannot hate. I hate the Actions, but I love the Face; Oh, were thy Vertue more, or Beauty less! I'm all Confusion, and my Soul's on fire, Torn by contending Reason and Desire: This bids me love, that bids me Love give o'er; One counsels best, the other pleases more. I know I ought to hate you for your Fault; But, oh! I cannot do the thing I ought. Canst thou, mean Wretch! canst thou contented prove, With the cold Relicks of a Rival's Love? Why did I see that Face to charm my Breast? Or having seen, why did I know the rest? Gods! if I have obey'd your just Commands, If I've deserv'd some Favour of your hands, Make me that tame, that easie Fool again, And rid me of my Knowledge, and my Pain. And you, false Fair! for whom so oft I've griev'd, Pity a Wretch that begs to be deceiv'd; Forswear your self for one who dies for you, Vow not a word of the whole Charge was true; But Scandals all, and Forgeries, devis'd By a vain Wretch, neglected and despis'd. I too will help to forward the Deceit, And, to my power, contribute to the Cheat. And thou, bold Man, who think'st to rival me, For thy Presumption I cou'd pardon thee; I cou'd forgive thy lying in her Arms, I cou'd forgive thy rifling all her Charms; But, oh! I never can forgive the Tongue, That boasts her Favours, and proclaims my Wrong. Upon the same Occasion. What Fury does disturb my Rest? What Hell is this within my Breast? Now I abhorr, and now I love; And each an equal Torment prove. I see Celinda's Cruelty, I see she loves all Men but me; I see her Falshood, see her Pride, I see ten thousand Faults beside; I see she sticks at nought that's ill; Yet, oh ye Powers! I love her still. Others on Precipices run, Which, blind with Love, they cannot shun. I see my Danger, see my Ruine, Yet seek, yet court my own undoing: And each new Reason I explore To hate her makes me love her more. The Antidote. When I see the bright Nymph who my Heart does enthral, When I view her soft Eyes, and her languishing Air, Her Merit so great, my own Merit so small, It makes me adore, and it makes me despair. But when I consider, that she squanders on Fools All those Treasures of Beauty with which she is stor'd; My Fancy it damps, my Passion it cools, And it makes me despise what before I ador'd. Thus sometimes I despair, and sometimes I despise; I love, and I hate, but I never esteem. The Passion grows up, when I view her bright Eyes, Which my Rival's destroy, when I look upon them. How wisely does Nature things so diff'rent unite! In such odd Compositions our safety is found; As the Blood of the Scorpion is a Cure for the Bite; So her Folly makes whole, whom her Beauty does wound. Upon a Favour offer'd. CÃ¦lia, too late you wou'd repent The off'ring all your store; Is now but like a Pardon sent To one that's dead before. While at the first you cruel prov'd, And grant the Bliss too late; You hinder'd me of one I lov'd, To give me one I hate. I thought you innocent, as fair, When first my court I made; But when your Falshoods plain appear, My Love no longer stay'd. Your Bounty of those Favours shown, Whose Worth you first deface; Is melting valu'd Medals down, And giving us the Brass. Oh, since the thing we beg's a Toy, That's priz'd by Love alone, Why cannot Women grant the Joy, Before our Love is gone? The Reconcilement. Be gone, ye Sighs! be gone, ye Tears! Be gone, ye Jealousies and Fears. Celinda swears she never lov'd, Celinda swears none ever mov'd Her Heart, but I; if this be true, Shall I keep company with you? What tho' a senceless Rival swore, She said as much to him before? What though I saw him in her Bed? I'll trust not what I saw, but what she said. Curse on the Prudent and the Wise, Who ne'er believe such pleasing Lyes: I grant she only does deceive; I grant 'tis Folly to believe; But by this Folly I vast Pleasures gain, While you with all your Wisdom live in Pain. Dialogue Between a Lover and his Friend. (Irregular Verses.) Friend. Value thy self, fond Youth, no more On Favours Mulus had before; He had her first, her Virgin Flame; You like a bold Intruder came To the cold Relicks of a Feast, When he at first had seiz'd the best. Lover. When he dull Sot had seiz'd the worse, I came in at the Second Course, 'Tis Chance that first makes People love, Judgment their riper Fancies move. Mulus you say first charm'd her Eyes; First, she lov'd Babies and Dirt-Pies; But she grew wiser, and in time Found out the folly of those Toys, and him. Friend. If Wisdom change in Love begets, Women, no doubt, are wondrous Wits. But Wisdom that now makes her change to you, In time will make her change to others too, Lover. I grant you no Man can forsee his Doom; But shall I grieve because an ill may come? Yet I'll allow her Change, when she can see A Man deserves her more than me, As much as I deserve her more than he. Friend. Did they with our own Eyes see our Desert, No Woman e'er cou'd from her Lover part. But oh! they see not with their own, All things to them are through false Opticks shown. Love at the first does all your Charms encrease, When the Tube's turn'd, Hate represents 'em less. Lover. Whate'er may come, I will not grieve, For Dangers that I can't believe. She'll ne'er cease loving me; or if she do, 'Tis ten to one I cease to love her too. Epigram. LYCE. Go, said old Lyce, senceless Lover, go, And with soft Verses court the Fair; but know, With all thy Verses, thou canst get no more Than Fools without one Verse have had before. Enrag'd at this, upon the Bawd I flew; And that which most enrag'd me was, 'twas true. The fair Mourner. In what sad Pomp the mournful Charmer lies! Does she lament the Victim of her Eyes? Or wou'd she Hearts with soft Compassion move, To make 'em take the deeper stamp of Love? What Youth so wise, so wary to escape, When Rigour comes, drest up in Pity's shape? Let not in vain those precious Tears be shed, Pity the Dying fair One, not the Dead; While you unjustly of the Fates complain, I grieve as much for you, as much in vain. Each to relentless Judges make their moan, Blame not Death's Cruelty, but cease you own. While raging Passion both out Souls does wound, A soveraign Balm might sure for both be found; Wou'd you but wipe your fruitless Tears away, And with a just Compassion mine survey. Epigram. To his false Mistress. Thou saidst that I alone thy Heart cou'd move, And that for me thou wou'dst abandon Jove. I lov'd thee then, not with a love defil'd, But as a Father loves his only Child. I know thee now, and tho' I fiercelier burn, Thou art become the Object of my Scorn. See what thy Falshood gets; I must confess I love thee more, but I esteem the less. Epigram. Love and Jealousie. How much are they deceiv'd who vainly strive, By jealous Fears, to keep our Flames alive? Love's like a Torch, which if secur'd from Blasts, Will faintlier burn; but then it longer lasts. Expos'd to storms of Jealousie and Doubt, The Blaze grows greater, but 'tis sooner out. Elegy. The Petition. (In imitation of Catullus.) Is there a pious Pleasure, that proceeds From contemplation of our vertuous Deeds? That all mean, sordid Actions we despise, And scorn to gain a Throne by Cheats and Lyes? Thyrsis, thou hast sure Blessings laid in store, From thy just dealing in this curst Amour. What Honour can in Words or Deeds be shown, Which to the Fair thou hast not said and done? On her false Heart they all are thrown away; She only swears, more eas'ly to betray. Ye Powers! that know the many Vows she broke, Free my just Soul from this unequal Yoke! My Love boils up, and, like a raging Flood, Runs through my Veins, and taints my Vital Blood. I do not vainly beg she may grow chaste, Or with an equal Passion burn at last; The one she cannot practise, tho' she wou'd, And I contemn the other, tho' she shou'd. Nor ask I Vengeance on the perjur'd Jilt: 'Tis punishment enough to have her Guilt. I beg but Balsam for my bleeding Breast, Cure for my Wounds, and from my Labours rest. Elegy. Upon quitting his Mistress. I know, Celinda, I have born too long, And, by forgiving, have encreas'd my Wrong: Yet if there be a Power in Verse to slack Thy course in Vice, or bring fled Vertue back, I'll undertake the Task; howe'er so hard, A gen'rous Action is its own Reward. Oh! were thy Vertues equal to thy Charms, I'd fly from Crowns to live within those Arms: But who, oh who, can e'er believe thee just, When such known Falshoods have destroy'd all Trust? Farewel, false Fair! nor shall I longer stay; Since we must part, why shou'd we thus delay? Your Love alone, was what my Soul cou'd prize; And missing that, can all the rest despise. Yet shou'd I not repent my Follies past, Cou'd you take up, and grow reserv'd at last, 'Twou'd please me, parted from your fatal Charms, To see you happy in another's Arms. Whatever Threatnings Fury might extort, Oh fear not I shou'd ever do you hurt: For tho' my former Passion is remov'd, I wou'd not injure one I once had lov'd. Adieu! While thus I waste my time in vain, Sure there are Maids I might entirely gain: I'll search for such, and to the first that's true, Resign the Heart so hardly freed from you. To his Mistress. Against Marriage. Yes, all the World must sure agree, He who's secur'd of having thee, Will be entirely blest; But 'twere in me too great a Wrong, To make one who has been so long My Queen, my Slave at last. Nor ought those things to be confin'd, That were for Publick Good design'd; Cou'd we in foolish Pride, Make the Sun always with us stay, 'Twou'd burn our Corn and Grass away, To starve the World beside. Let not the Thoughts of parting, fright Two Souls which Passion does unite; For while our Love does last, Neither will strive to go away; And why the Devil shou'd we stay, When once that love is past? Epigram. Chloe. Chloe new-marry'd looks on Men no more; Why then 'tis plain for what she lookt before. Epigram. Cornus. Cornus proclaims aloud his Wife's a Whore; Alas, good Cornus, what can we do more? Wert thou no Cuckold, we might make thee one; But being one, we cannot make thee none. Epigram. Thraso. Thraso picks Quarrels when he's drunk at Night; When sober in the Morning, dares not fight. Thraso, to shun those Ills that may ensue, Drink not at Night, or drink at Morning too. Epigram. Gripe and Shifter. Rich Gripe does all his Thoughts and Cunning bend, T'encrease that Wealth he wants the Soul to spend. Poor Shifter does his whole Contrivance set To spend that Wealth, he wants the Sense to get. How happy wou'd appear to each his Fate, Had Gripe his Humour, or he Gripe's Estate! Kind Fate and Fortune, blend 'em if you can, And of two Wretches, make one happy Man. To CÃ¦lia, upon some Alterations in her Face. Ah, CÃ¦lia! where are now the Charms, That did such wondrous Passions move? Time, cruel Time, those Eyes disarms, And blunts the feeble Darts of Love. What Malice does the Tyrant bear To Womens Int'rest, and to ours? Beauties in which the Publick share, The greedy Villain first devours. Who, without Tears, can see a Prince, That Trains of fawning Courtiers had, Abandon'd, left without defence? Nor is thy hapless Fate less sad. Thou who so many Fools hast known, And all the Fools would hardly do, Shou'dst now confine thy self to one! And he, alas! a Husband too. See the ungrateful Slaves how fast They from thy setting Glories run; And in what mighty Crowds they haste, To worship Flavia's rising Sun! In vain are all the practis'd Wiles, In vain those Eyes wou'd Love impart; Not all th'Advances, all the Smiles, Can move one unrelenting Heart. While Flavia, charming Flavia still, By Cruelty, her Cause maintains; And scarce vouchsafes a careless Smile To the poor Slaves that wear her Chains. Well, CÃ¦lia, let them waste their Tears, But sure they will in time repine, That thou hast not a Face like hers, Or she has not a Heart like thine. The Retirement. All hail, ye Fields, where constant Peace attends! All hail, ye sacred, solitary Groves! All hail, ye Books, my true, my real Friends, Whose Conversation pleases, and improves! Cou'd one who study'd your sublimer Rules, Become so mad to search for Joys abroad? To run to Towns, to herd with Knaves and Fools, And undistinguish'd pass among the Crowd? One to ambitious Fancy's made a Prey, Thinks Happiness in great Preferment lies; Nor fears for that his Country to betray, Curst by the Fools, and laught at by the Wise. Others whom avaricious Thoughts bewitch, Consume their Time, to multiply their Gains; And fansying Wretched all that are not rich, Neglect the End of Life to get the Means. Others the Name of Pleasure does invite, All their dull Time in sensual Joys they live; And hope to gain that solid firm Delight By Vice, which Innocence alone can give. But how perplext, alas! is Humane Fate? I whom nor Avarice, nor Pleasures move; Who view with scorn the Trophies of the Great, Yet must my self be made a Slave to Love. If this dire Passion never will be gone, If Beauty always must my Heart enthral; Oh! rather let me be confin'd to one, Than madly thus be made a Prey to all! One who has early known the Pomps of State; (For things unknown 'tis Ign'rance to condemn) And after having view'd the gawdy Bait, Can boldly say, The Trifle I contemn. In her blest Arms contented cou'd I live, Contented cou'd I die: But, oh! my Mind I feed with Fancies, and my Thoughts deceive, With hope of things impossible to find. In Women how shou'd Sense and Beauty meet? The wisest Men their Youth in Follies spend; The best is he that earliest finds the Cheat, And sees his Errors while there's time to mend.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Pastoral Eclogues. Eclogue I. Daphne. Sicilian Muse, my humble Voice inspire To sing of Daphne's Charms and Damon's Fire. Long had the faithful Swain supprest his Grief, And since he durst not hope, ne'er askt relief. But at th'arrival of the fatal Day That took the Nymph and all his Joys away; With dying Looks he gaz'd upon the Fair, And what his Tongue could not, his Eyes declare: Till with deep Sighs, as if his Heart-strings broke, Pressing her Hand, these tender Things he spoke: Damon. Ah lovely Nymph! behold your Lover burn, And view that Passion which you'll not return. As no Nymphs Charms did ever equal thine; So no Swain's Love did ever equal mine. How happy, Fair, how happy should I be, Might I but sacrifice my self for thee? Cou'd I but please thee with my dying Verse, And make thee shed one Tear upon my Hearse? Daphne. Too free an Offer of that Love you make, Which now, alas, I have not pow'r to take: Your Wounds I cannot, tho' I wou'd, relieve: Phaon has all the Love that I can give. Had you among the rest at first assail'd My Heart, when free, you had perhaps prevail'd. Now if you blame, Oh blame not me, but Fate, That never brought you till 'twas grown too late. Damon. Had the Fates brought me then, too charming Fair, I could not hope, and now I must despair. Rul'd by your Friends, you quit the Lovers Flame For Flocks, for Pastures, for an empty Name. Yet tho' the blest Possession Fate denies; Oh let me gaze for ever on those Eyes. So just, so true, so innocent's my Flame, That Phaon did he see it, cou'd not blame. Daphne. Such generous Ends I know you still pursue, What I can do, be sure I will for you. If on Esteem, or Pity you can live, Or Hopes of more, if I had more to give; Those you may have, but cannot have my Heart: And since we now perhaps for ever part; Such noble Thoughts through all your life express, May make the Value more, the Pity less. Damon. Can you then go? Can you for ever part (Ye Gods! what shivering Pains surround my Heart!) And have one Thought to make your Pity less? Ah Daphne, cou'd I half my Pangs express, You cou'd not think, tho' hard as Rocks you were, Your Pity ever cou'd too great appear. I ne'er shall be one Moment free from pain, Till I behold those charming Eyes again. When gay Diversions do your Thoughts employ, I wou'd not come to interrupt the Joy: But when from them you some spare Moment find, Think then, oh think on whom you leave behind! Think with what Heart I shall behold the green, Where I so oft those charming Eyes have seen! Think with what Grief I walk the Groves alone, When You, the Glory of them all, are gone! Yet, oh! that little time you have to stay, Let me still speak, and gaze my Soul away! But see, my Passion that small Aid denies; Grief stops my Tongue, and Tears o'erflow my Eyes. Eclogue II. Galatea. Thyrsis, the gaiest one of all the Swains, Who fed their Flocks upon th'Arcadian Plains; While Love's mad Passion quite devour'd his Heart, And the coy Nymph that caus'd neglects his Smart; Strives in low Numbers, such as Shepherds use, If not to move her Breast, his own amuse. You, Chloris, who with scorn refuse to see The mighty Wounds that you have made on me; Yet cannot sure with equal Pride disdain, To hear an humble Hind of his complain. Now while the Flocks and Herds to Shades retire, While the fierce Sun sets all the World on fire; Through burning Fields, through rugged Brakes I rove, And to the Hills and Woods declare my Love. How small's the Heat? how easie is the Pain I feel without, to that I feel within? Yet scornful Galatea will not hear, But from my Songs and Pipe still turns her Ear. Not so the sage Corisca, nor the fair Climena, nor rich Ãgon's only Care: From them my Songs a just Compassion drew, And they shall have them, since contemn'd by you. Why name I them, when ev'n chaste Cynthia stays, And Pan himself, to listen to my Lays? Pan, whose sweet Pipe has been admir'd so long, Has not disdain'd sometimes to hear my Song. Yet Galatea Scorns whate'er I say; And Galatea's wiser sure than they. Relentless Nymph! can nothing move your Mind? Must you be deaf, because you are unkind? Tho' you dislike the Subject of my Lays, Yet sure the Sweetness of my Voice might please. It is not thus that you dull Mopsus use, His Songs divert you, tho' you mine refuse. Yet I cou'd tell you, fair One, if I wou'd, (And since you treat me thus, methinks I shou'd) What the wise Lycon said, when in yon Plain, He saw him court in hope, and me in vain; Forbear, fond Youth, to chase a heedless Fair, Nor think with well-tun'd Verse to please her Ear; Seek out some other Nymph, nor e'er repine, That one who likes his Songs, shou'd fly from thine. Ah, Lycon! ah! your Rage false Dangers forms; 'Tis not his Songs, but 'tis his Fortune Charms: Yet, scornful Maid, in time you'll find those Toys Can yield no real, no substantial Joys; In vain his Wealth, his Titles gain esteem, If for all that you are asham'd of Him. Ah, Galatea, wou'dst thou turn those Eyes, Wou'dst thou but once vouchsafe to hear my Cries: In such soft Notes I wou'd my Pains impart, As cou'd not fail to move thy rocky Heart; With such sweet Songs I wou'd thy Fame make known, As Pan himself might not disdain to own. Oh cou'dst thou, fair One, but contented be To tend the Sheep, and chase the Hares with me; To have thy Praises eccho'd through the Groves, And pass thy Days with one who truly loves; Nor let those gaudy Toys thy Heart surprize, Which the Fools envy, and the Sage despise. But Galatea Scorns my humble Flame, And neither asks my Fortune, nor my Name. Of the best Cheese my well-stor'd Dairy's full, And my soft Sheep produce the finest Wool; The richest Wines of Greece my Vineyard's yield, And smiling Crops of Grain adorn my Field. Ah, foolish Youth! in vain thou boast'st thy store, Have what thou wilt, if Mopsus still has more. See whilst thou sing'st, behold her haughty Pride, With what disdain she turns her Head aside! Oh, why wou'd Nature, to our Ruine, place A Tyger's Heart, with such an Angel's Face? Cease, Shepherd, cease, at last thy fruitless Moan; Nor hope to gain a Heart already gone. While Rocks and Caves thy tuneful Notes resound, See how thy Corn lies wither'd on the Ground! The hungry Wolves devours thy fatten'd Lambs; And bleating for the Young, makes lean the Damms. Take, Shepherd, take thy Hook, thy Flocks pursue, And when one Nymph proves cruel, find a new. Eclogue III. (Taken from the Eighth Eclogue of Virgil.) Damon. Arise, O Phosphorus! and bring the Day, While I in Sighs and Tears consume away; Deceiv'd with flattering Hopes of Nisa's Love; And to the Gods my vain Petitions move: Tho' they've done nothing to prevent my Death, I'll yet invoke 'em with my dying Breath. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Arcadia's famous for its spacious Plains, Its whistling Pine-Trees, and its shady Groves, And often hears the Swains lament their Loves. Great Pan upon its Mountains feeds his Goats, Who first taught Reeds to warble Rural Notes. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Mopsus weds Nisa! Oh, well-suited Pair! When he succeeds, what Lover can despair? After this Match, let Mares and Griffins breed; And Hounds with Hares in friendly consort feed. Go, Mopsus, go; provide the Bridal Cake; And to thy Bed the blooming Virgin take: In her soft Arms thou shalt securely rest. Behold, the Evening comes to make thee blest! Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Oh, Nisa, happy in a lovely Choice! While you with scorn neglect my Pipe and Voice; While you despise my humble Songs, my Herd, My shaggy Eye-brows, and my rugged Beard; While through the Plains disdainfully you move, And think no Shepherd can deserve your Love; Mopsus alone can the nice Virgin win, With charming Person, and with graceful Mien. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. When first I saw you on those fatal Plains, I reach'd you Fruit; your Mother too was there; Scarce had you seen the thirteenth Spring appear: Yet Beauty's Buds were opening in your Face; I gaz'd, and Blushes did your Charms encrease. 'Tis Love, thought I, that's rising in her Breast; Alas, your Passion, by my own, I guest; Then upon trust I fed the raging Pains. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Oh, Love! I know thee now; thou ow'st thy Birth To Rocks; some craggy Mountain brought thee forth: Nor is it Humane Blood that fills thy Veins, Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Relentless Love to bold Medea show'd, To stain her guilty Hands in Children's Blood. Was she more cruel, or more wicked he? He was a wicked Counsellor, a cruel Mother she. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Now let the Scriech-Owls vie with warbling Swans; Upon hard Oaks let blushing Peaches grow, And from the Brambles, liquid Amber flow. The harmless Wolves, the rav'nous Sheep shall shun; And valiant Deer, at fearful Grey-hounds run: Let the Sea rise, and overflow the Plains. Begin, my Muse, begin th'Arcadian Strains. Adieu, ye Flocks, no more shall I pursue! Adieu, ye Groves, a long, a long Adieu! And you, coy Nymph, who all my Vows disdain, Take this last Present from a dying Swain. Since you dislike whate'er in Life I said, You may be pleas'd, perhaps, to hear I'm dead: This Leap shall put an end to all my Pains. Now cease, my Muse, now cease th'Arcadian Strains. Thus Damon sung while on the Cliff he stood, Then headlong plung'd into the raging Flood. All with united Grief the Loss bemoan, Except the Authress of his Fate alone, Who hears it with an unrelenting Breast. Ah, cruel Nymph! forbear your Scorns at last. How much soe'er you may the Love despise, 'Tis barb'rous to insult on one that dies. FINIS.</field>
