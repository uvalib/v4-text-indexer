      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT VERTVOVS AND WORTHY KNIGHT, SIR HENRY LEONARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I. [Loue wing'd my hopes and taught me howe to flie] [1] Loue wing'd my hopes and taught me howe to flie Farre from base earth but not to mount too hie, For true pleasure Liues in measure Which if men forsake, take, Blinded they into follie runne, and griefe for pleasure take. 2 But my vaine hopes proude of their new taught flight, Enamour'd fought to woo the Suunes fayre light, whose rich brightnesse mooued their lightnesse to aspire so hye, That all scorch't and consum'd with fire, now drowned in woe they lye. 3 And none but loue their wofull hap did rue, For loue did know that their desires were true, though fate frowned, and now drowned, they in sorrow dwell, It was the purest light of heauen, for whose fayre loue they fell. II. [My loue bound me with a kisse] [1] My loue bound me with a kisse That I should no longer stay When I felt so sweete a blisse, I had lesse power to part away, Alas, that women doth not know Kisses makes men loath to goe. 2 Yes she knowes it but too well, For I heard when Venus doue In her eare did softlie tell, That kisses were the seales of loue, Oh muse not then though it be so, Kisses makes men loth to goe. 3 Wherefore did she thus inflame, My desires heat my bloud, Instantlie to quench the same, And starue whome she had giuen food. I I, the common sence can show, Kisses make men loath to go. 4 Had she bid me go at first It would nere haue greeued my hart, Hope delaide had beene the worst, But ah to kisse and then to part, How deepe it strucke, speake Gods you know Kisses make men loth to goe. III. [O O how my thoughts do beare mee] [1] O O how my thoughts do beare mee Which by deepe sighs intreat thee, Hey ho, fie fie, what a thing is this Thus to lie still when we might kisse And play, and foole Heere in the coole Of y? stillest cleerest sweetest euening, Philomell did euer choose for singing. 2 See how my lips complaine them, Thy lips should thus detaine them, Aye me harke how the Nightingales, In the darke each to other to cals, Whil'st thou, O thou, Dar'st not avow, The enioying of the truest pleasure, Loue did euer boord vp in his treasure. IIII. [Dreames and Imaginations] [1] Dreames and Imaginations Are all the recreations Absence can gaine me dreames When I wake, confound me, Thoghts for her sake doth wound me Least the disdaine me, Then sinking let me lie, Or thinking let me die, Since loue hath slaine me. 2 Dreames are but coward and doe, Much good they dare not stand too, Asham'd of the morrow, Thoughts like a child that winketh, Hee's not beguild that thinketh, Hath peirst me thorow, Both filling me with blisses, Both killing me with kisses, dying in sorrow. 3 Dreames with their false pretences, And thoughts confounds my senses, In the conclusion, Which like a glasse did shew mee, What came to passe and threw mee, Into conclusion, Shee made mee leaue all other, Yet had she got another, This was abusion. V. [My thought this other night] [1] My thought this other night I sawe a pretie sight That pleasd me much, A faire and comly maid Not squemish nor afraid To let me tuch, Our lips most sweetly kissing Each other neuer missing, Her smiling lookes did shew content And that shee did but what she meant 2 And as her lips did moue, The eccho still was loue, loue loue me sweete, Then with a maiden blush, Instead of crying pish Our lips did meete, With Musicke sweetely sounding, With pleasures all abounding, We kept the burden of the song, Which was that loue should take no wrong. 3 And yet as maidens vse, She seemed to refuse, The name of loue, Vntill I did protest, That I did loue her best, And so will proue. With that as both amazed, Each at the other gazed, My eyes did see, my hands did feele, Her eyes of fire, her brest of steele. 4 Oh when I felt her brest, Where loue it selfe did rest, My loue was such, I could haue beene content, My best bloud to haue spent, In that sweete tutch. But now comes that which vext vs, There was a bar betwixt vs, A bar that bard me from that part, Where nature did contend with art. 5 If euer loue had power, To send one happie houre, Then shew thy might, And take such bars away, Which are the onely stay Of loues delight. All this was but a dreaming, Although another meaning, Dreames may proue true, as thoughts are free, I will loue you, you may loue mee. VI. [Whoso is tide must needs be bound] [1] Whoso is tide must needs be bound, And he thats bound cannot bee free, Who so is lost is hardly found &amp; he thats blind is bard to see, Who so is watcht with iealous eies Must sit vp late, and early rise. 2 He may well write that cannot come, And send his eyes to plead his case, He may well looke that must be dum, Vntill he find both time and place, He that is tyde to houres and times, Though not himselfe may send his rimes. 3 What hap haue they who doth abound, With all things that the earth doth beare, And yet for want some time doth sound, Breathing a life twixt hope and feare, Alas poore soule my case is such, I want my will, yet haue too much. 4 I would, but dare not what I would, I dare, but cannot what I dare, I can, but must not if I could, I can, I must, I will not spare, I write no more, but shall I come, I saie no more, but closely mume. VII. [Fie fie, fie fie what a coile is heere] [1] Fie fie, fie fie what a coile is heere, Why strike you so to get a kisse, Doe doe doe what you will, You shall be nere the neere, Had I been willing So to be billing You had preuailed long ere this, Sweete stand away, let me alone, Or els in faith, Ile get me gone. 2 Come come come doe you not perceiue, I am not yet dispos'd to yeeld, Staie staie staie but a while, My loue will giue you leaue, This my denyall, Is but a tryall, If faint desire will flie the field, Whoop looke you now, I pray be still, Naie then in faith doe what you will. VIII. [Beautie stand further] [1] Beautie stand further, Repine not at my blaming, Is it not murther, To set my hart on flaming, Thus hopelesse to take Bare sight of such a glorie Doth tempt me to make My death beget a storie, Then pitie least some worse thing ensue it, My deaths true cause, will force the gilt to rue it. 2 Is it not better, To loue thy friend in good sort, Then to be debter, For kindnesse name to report, If you had the lesse, For this rich mercie lending, Then should I confesse, No thrift were in such spending. Oh pittie me, the gaine shall be thine owne all, I would but liue, to make thy vertues knowne all. IX. [Now what is loue I pray thee tell] [1] Now what is loue I pray thee tell, It is that fountaine and that well Where pleasures and repentance dwell, It is perhaps that fancesing bell That towles all in to heau'n or hell, And this is loue, I heare tell. 2 Now what is loue I praie thee saie, It is a worke on holy daie, It is December match't with Maie, When lustie blood in fresh arraie, Heare ten monethes after of their plaie, And this is loue as I heare saie. 3 Now what is loue I praie thee faine, It is a Sunne-shine mixt with raine, It is a gentle pleasing paine, A flower that dyes and springs againe, It is a noe that would full faine, And this is loue as I heare faine. 4 Yet what is loue I praie thee saie, It is a pretie shadie waie, As well found out by night as daie, It is a thing will soone decaie, Then take the vantage whilst you maie, And this is loue as I heare saie. 5 Now what is loue I praie thee show, A thing that creepes it cannot goe, A prize that passeth to and fro, A thing for one a thing for moe, And he that proues shall find it so, And this is loue as I well know. X. [Loues god is a boy] [1] Loues god is a boy None but cowherds regard him, His dart is a toy Great opinion hath mard him, The feare of y? wagg Hath made him so bragg Chide him, heele flie thee And not come nie thee, Little boy, pretty knaue shoote not at randome, For if you hit mee, slaue Ile tell, your grandome. 2 Fond loue is a child, And his compasse is narrow, Yoong fooles are beguild With the same of his arrow, He dareth not strike, If his stroke do mislike, Cupid doe you heare mee? Come not too neere mee, Little boy, pretie knaue, hence I beseech you, For if I you hit me slaue, in faith Ile breech you. 3 Th'ape lones to meddle, When he finds a man idle, Else is he a flurting, Where his marke is a courting, When women grow true, Come teach mee to sue, Then Ile come to thee, Pray thee, and woo thee, Little boy, pretie knaue, make me not stagger, For if you hit me slaue, Ile call thee begger. XI. [Over these brookes trusting to ease mine eies] [1] Over these brookes trusting to ease mine eies, Euen great in labour with her teares, I laid my face wherein there lies Clusters of clowdes, which no sunne euer cleeres In watry glasse, my watry eies I see Sorrowes ill eased, where sorrowes painted be. 2 My thoughts imprisoned in my secret woes, With famie breathes, doe issue oft in sound, The sound to this strange aire no sooner goes, But that it doth with Ecchoes force rebound, And make me heare the plaints I would refraine, Thus outward helpes my inward griefes maintaine. 3 Now in this sand I would discharge my mind, And cast from me part of my burdnous cares, But in the sand my tales foretold I find, And see therein how well the waters fares, Since streames, ayre, sand, mine eyes and eares conspire, What hope to quench, where each thing blowes the fire. XII. [Whither runneth my sweet hart] [1] Whither runneth my sweet hart, Stay a while pree thee, Not too fast, To much haste Maketh waste, But if thou wilt needes be gone, Take my loue with thee, Thy minde doth binde me to no vile condition, So doth thy truth preuent me of suspition. 2 Go thy wayes then where thou please, So I by thee Daie and night I delight In thy sight, Neuer griefe on me did seaze When thou wast nie mee. My strength at length, y? scorn'd thy faire c?mandings Hath not forgot the prise of rash withstandings. 3 Now my thoughts are free from strife, Sweete let me kisse thee, Now can I Willingly Wish to die, For I doe but loath my life, When I doe misse thee, Come proue my loue, my hart is not disguised, Loue showne and knowne ought not to be despised. XIII. [Once did I loue, where now I haue no liking] [1] Once did I loue, where now I haue no liking, Like can I not for shee was neuer louing. Once did I proue, but then put by my striking, Strike nill I now though shee were euer prouing, To proue or strike it now rests at my will, To make me loue or like, tis past her skill. 2 Rest in vnrest, was once my chiefest pleasure, Please will I now my selfe in her disquiet, Bad for the best I chose at wanton leasure, Ease bids me now to brooke a better dyet, Rich in content I rest to see her plaining, Whose best at best is bad, not worth the gaining. XIIII. [Faire women like faire iewels are] [1] Faire women like faire iewels are, Whose worth lies in opinion, To praise them al must be his care That goes about to win one, &amp; wh? he hath her once obtain'd, To her face he must her flatter, But not to others least he moue Their eies to leuell at her. 2 The way to purchase truth in loue, If such way there be anie, Must be to giue her leaue to roue, And hinder one by manie, Beleeue thou must that she is fayre, When poysoned tongues doe sting her, Rich Iewels beare the selfe same hew, Put vpon anie finger. 3 The perfectest of mind and shape, Must looke for defamations. Liue how they will they cannot scape, Their persons are temptations, Then let the world condemne my choyse, As laughing at my follie, If she be kind the selfe same voyce, Is spred of the most hollie. XV. [Dainty darling, kinde and free] [1] Dainty darling, kinde and free Fairest maide I euer see, Deare vouchsafe to looke on mee, Listen when I sing to thee, What I will doe With a dildoe, Sing doe with a dildoe 2 Sweete now goe not yet I praie, Let no doubt thy mind dismaie, Here with mee thou shalt but staie, Onelie till I can displaie, What I will doe With a dildo, Sing doe with a dildo. 3 Quicklie prithee now be still, Naie you shall not haue your will, Trow you men will maidens kill, Tarrie but to learne the skill, What I will doe With a dildo, Sing doe with a dildo. 4 Prettie, wittie, sit mee by, Feare no cast of anie eye, Wee will plaie so priuilie, None shall see but you and I; What I will doe With a dildo, Sing doe with a dildo. XVI. [My loue is neither yoong nor olde] My loue is neither yoong nor olde, Not fiery hot nor frozen colde, But fresh and faire as springing brier, Blooming the fruit of loues desire, Not snowy white nor rosie red, But faire enough for sheepheards bed, And such a loue was neuer seene, On hill or dale or countrey greene. XVII. [Loue is a bable] [1] Loue is a bable, No man is able To say tis this or tis that, Tis full of passions Of sundry fashions, Tis like I cannot tell what. 2 Loues fayre i'th Cradle, Foule in the sable, Tis eyther too cold or too hot, An arrand lyar, Fed by desire, Is is, and yet it is not. 3 Loue is a fellowe, clad oft in yellowe, The canker-worme of the mind, A priuie mischiefe, And such a slye thiefe, No man knowes which waie to find. 4 Loue is a woonder, That's here and yonder, As common to one as to moe, A monstrous cheater, Euerie mans debter, Hang him, and so let him goe. XVIII. [Arise my thoughts &amp; mo?t you with y? sunne] [1] Arise my thoughts &amp; mo?t you with y? sunne, Call all the windes, to make you speedy winges, And to my fayrest Maya see you runne And weepe your last, while wantonly shee singes Then if you cannot moue, her hart to pittie, Lot oh alas ayh me be all your dittie. 2 Arise my thoughts no more if you returne, Denied of grace, which onely you desire, But let the Sunne your winges to ashes burne, And meete your passions in his quenchles fire, Yet if you moue faire Mayes heart to pittie, Let smiles, and loue, and kisses, be your dittie. 3 Arise my thoughts beyond the highest star, And gently rest you in faire Mayes eye, For that is fairer then the brightest ar, But if she frowne to see you climbe so hye, Couch in her lap, and with a mouing dittie, Of smiles, and loue, and kisses, beg for pittie. XIX. [Did euer man thus loue as I] [1] Did euer man thus loue as I, I thinke I was made, For no other trade, My minde doth it so hard apply, And all fond courses else doth flie 2 Vndooing were a pettie care, Loosing my best hopes, In their largest scopes, Two louing when I doe compare, Me thinks I could as trifles spare. 3 All my sad thoughts, though wide begunne, In her still doe meete, Who makes thinking sweete, And then to me againe they runne, To tell me all that they haue doone. 4 Thus doe I spend my dayes and houres, In a pleasant round, Where true ioyes are found, And there alone my soule deuours, All loues deare foode with longing powers. 5 A heau'n on earth is loue well met, There is more content, Then can well be spent, When in two fruitfull hearts 'tis set, Which will not bee in eithers debt. XX. [To sigh and to bee sad] [1] To sigh and to bee sad, To weepe and wish to die Is it not to be madd If not hypocrisie, Men of this sort Are womens sports, Beauties alluring, lookes rob wise men of their reason, That they speake nought at all, or speake all out of season. 2 Haue all men eyes to see? And haue none wit to know? Blossomes commend no tree, Where neuer fruit did growe, Disire doth blind A louers mind. He sees and doth allow that vice in his beloued, Fr? which no woman can be free or be remoued. 3 Let euerie thought of loue, Mixt with a world of feares, At last themselues remoue, Oh let consuming teares, Life blood distil'd No more be spil'd, Since all that scape the fall of womanish reiecting, Must yet be subiect to the pride of their neglecting. XXI. [Come sorrow come, sweet scayle] Come sorrow come, sweet scayle, By the which we ascend to the heauenlie place Where vertue sitteth smyling, To see how some looke pale with feare to beholde thy ill fauoured face, Vaine shewes their sence beguiling, For mirth hath no assurance Nor warrantly of durance Hence pleasures flie, sweete baite, On the which they may iustly be said to be fooles, That surfet by much tasting, Like theeues you lie in waite. Most subtillie how to prepare sillie soules, For sorrowes euerlasting. Wise griefes haue ioyfull turnings, Nice pleasures ende in mournings. FINIS.</field>
