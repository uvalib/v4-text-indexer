      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. In Grecian soyle two brothers born there is, they father haue Agenetos, whose blis, In happie time the children had attainde: the father died, and valiant sons remainde. The eldest sonne he Kenedoxus hight, the other namde Pesistratus, they fight With auncient foes, who Tetimetians callde, were (caitifs al) to martial brothers thralde: And conquest got, the brothers fal to strife, for spoile of foes, wheron ech seckes the life (In pointed place) of other to suppresse: Pesistrate conquerour departs, &amp; in distresse He brother leaues, whose fatal wo?d he thought with cursed blade his cruel h?d had wrought Wheron into Italian partes he flies, and wel retainde, a seemely Ladie spies, Whom louing long, the ioyful man at last his Ladies loue attainde, his dollors past. From ruling roome then Kenedox deprivde in natiue soile, to Tarent towne arivde, Where brother was: of treason he accusde the Louers both: and Champion not refusde, In combat fought: the Kenedox was slaine, and louers thus were rid from former paine Then Champion dead, was Pesistrate exild fr? Ladies sight, whose chaunged robes beguild His foes despight: th? proclamati? made that Pesistrate to proper soile should vade, He there ariude prepard a valiant hoste, wherewith returnde into Italian coast. He slew the fo in open chalengde fight, that erst had wrought the troubled man such spight And Lady woonne, he tooke hir to his mate, and livde at ease, and dyde in happie state. The Historie of Pesistratus and Catanea. In fertile fruitefull happye soyle which Grecia hath to name, And pleasant Appollonia lande contained in the same, There flourished the courtly race of Aganetians kind, Which stained euery hauty bloud in valure of the minde: And in the midst, when flickering fame had spred hir selfe to praise, To Aganetians did amount more happy golden dayes. For when Aganetos, the cheefe of Aganetians rout, Began to leaue his youthful yeares, proceeding to misdoubt: So fortune fauored his case, that he posseste the gaine, Whose want, had long dismayd his sense and causde him to complaine. And from Veronia, whom he chose to be his matched mate, There did proceede two goodly imps, which glorified his fate. And after his decease, when death incroched on his yeares, They did renue their fathers fame, and had not then their peeres. For when the perilous dispatch of childish age was spent, In no misorder, but in vse which daungers doth preuente And they approcht vnto the time when season doth indue The sense with reason, and the wights which reason do insue, These youthful Knights did tracke the steeps that sire had trod before, In such an ample valiant sort, as they could do no more. One Kenedoxus, the other eke he Pesistratus high, The yongest last whose fame my pen doth purpose to indite, Who chiefly through his valure great, so satisfied the sire, That Pesistratus to prefer the father dyd desire. And therefore when as crooked age did onerate his backe, And he opprest with faint disease, did feele of force the lacke, He cals to him these brothers twayne, who present thus he sayde: (But to the elder first his speeche and meaning he conuayd:) Thou Kenedoxus knowest wel the Aganetians fame, And to be Aganetians heire thou lookest for the same: And since it is thy right, my sonne, I graunt thou shalt inioy The very same, without my let, disturbance or anoy: But oh my welbeloued babes, consider in your braine, Now I haue labored for your wealth and for your propre gaine, In seeking to suppresse the foes which gape for the dispoyle Of Aganetians, vnto whom I alwayes gaue the foyle. I meane the Tetimetians, they, who burne in furies fire, To haue on Aganetians bloud the ful of their desire. But what conflicts and combates fierce, it needes not to be showne, Hath bin betwixt my selfe and them, for it is wel yknowne. Now this is my request my sonnes, your prowesse may vphold The fame, which Tetimetians haue so derely to me sold, For wel I do perceiue, bycause there is two springals sprong From Tetimetians, you shall feele their wrath ere it be long: And therefore warily prouide, and manfully pretend, In al their fierce assaults your selues with courage to defend: Wherof, not only you shal reape immortall happy praise, But also gaine a quiet state, attaining to the stayes Which nere your predecessors could before you yet possesse. But euer, for your sakes, haue liued in werisome distresse: And for bycause your stomacks might in no wise seeme to faile, Nor once your harts, in your defence and quarel for to quaile, I will declare to you, the cause from whence began this strife. Which hath indured, euer since the entrance of my life. When Turkish nation did assay our Appollonia soyle, To bring the same vnto decay, and to a shameful foyle, Tetimetians auncester by craft and treason did conspire, Unto the Turkes against the same, for priuie prouling hire: Which, when your graundsire Aganes perceiued to be so, How Tetime by treason wrought, and was so geeat a fo Against his natiue countrey (movde by nature to the same) He brought before the armed rout, this Tetimes to shame: For there in open audience he his treason did discry, Which done he offred to approue the matter by and by, Wheras in open sight, by force this Tetimes he slew, And after slayne, his trayterous corps vpon a dunghil drewe. Which when the chieftaines viewed wel of Aganes his might. And how the traytour he had slayne in maintenance of right. They al consented and agreed, your graundsire should possesse Tetimes heritage, wherein he tooke a firme release, And Aganetians euer since haue so inioyde the same, Wheron the Tetimetians most their malice do proclayme. Thus know you al the ful effecte (my children) of the case, And therfore seeke you to insew your graunsters former rase. But vnto thee Pesistratus, with fatherly consent, I giue my blisse, as much as of a father may be meant: And wil thee only, to maintayne the Aganetians fame, And to reuenge these foes dispight, vnto their further shame: And whatsoeuer either of you by force of foes attayne, I wil it do redownd to thee, as for a rightful gaine. And so be stint, and gushing teares proceeded from his eyes Upon his brest, like dropping dewes descending from the skyes: And force did faint, and wauering life was vp and downe ytrost, Til at the last in happy time he yelded vp his ghost. But, when to brothers did appeare their fathers mourneful death. With roaring voyce and shryking cryes, and sighs and sobbing breath, And woful houlings, plaintes, and teares, and piteous mones, they spend Their youthful dayes, in ruful sorte vnto a paineful ende. But in a season, when the rage of burning did aslake. (Wherby the boylings did delay) they did begin to make The rich and solemne funerals, (according to the vse) Of fathers carkasse, meete for earth, which done without abuse, With al things incident therto, the brothers, though dismayd Through death of sire, yet did deuise how eche thing might be stayd: But Pesistratus, cheefely movde by nature to the same, To brother Kenedoxus, thus his speeche began to frame: Though we vnhappy haue great cause with teares vs to complaine, Yet season (brother) seemes to craue we should therfore refraine, And though it be both natural and duety we do so, Yet is it needeful to surmise on furies of our fo: And therfore, sorow set a side, and pensiuenesse from hart, Let lustye blouds of Aganes be bold to do their part, In seeking to maintaine the fame, the honor and renowne, Which Aganetians heretofore haue gayned, as a crowne, Wherin you seazed, must possesse the profits of their toyle, And therefore most had neede to care herein, and most to moyle: And I, as duety doth me binde, and fathers sweete request, To maintnance of my brothers wealth, am alwayes ready prest. And though our father now deceast, is so for euer gone, Yet let our fathers streite preceptes be alwayes thought vpon: And since his greatest charge was this, that we, deuoyde of blame, Should maintaine auncestors renoume, and put our foes to shame, As needful now, let mutual braynes suppose vppon the case, That we may both auoyde our payne, and beautifie the rase Of former Aganetians, who haue vsde their former care, That we successors vnto them, may likewise partly beare The fruiteful flower of their fame: thus doing may we say, Our auncestors haue wel begonne, and we haue made the slay: But otherwise, if we should slacke our dueties to prefarre, They should not be so much a fame to vs, but we a scarre To them, and those which shal insue of Aganetians blood, Who after vs, may rightly say, wee neuer did them good. 'Tis true, quoth Kenedoxus then, I graunt to your desire, And gentle brother to these things, I willingly aspire: And therefore, as our fathers wil, of you so likewise I Do craue, these matters to dispose, and I shal nought deny, But vrge my trauel, to pursue the force of your aduise, From whence I doubt not, but the proofe of profit wil arise. And thus these brothers do conclude their talke, and now begin To follow the effectes therof: whom I wil leaue herein, And vnto Tetimetians rage my penne and I must bende, For to discry the mind at large, and matter they intende. The Tetimetians waying well how euery thing doth stand, And how Agenetes is dead, and they of stronger hand, And how the brothers be the chiefe of Aganetians route, Wheron they gather lesse suspect or motion of misdoute, In fell and furious ranckrous rage so fiercely they abound, That now in haste, but al in wast, they hope straight to confounde The Aganetians, and proceed in wrathfulnesse and ire, By sundry shiftes and secret craftes to worke the sayde desire. But Anteres, the principall of Tetimetians, he Pervsing better of the case than al the rest could see, Amongst the midst, began with voyce amounting, thus to say: My friendes and Neuews, be attent to that I shal display: The Aganetians (as you knowe) the quarel do defend, And we desirous of reuenge, the quarel do extend: Now, since the quarel is our owne, and that we seeke our fame, We ought to chalenge them, as so we get no further shame: And therefore note what I intend, I haue (as you do knowe) Two sonnes proceeded from my loynes, who daily seeme to grow And to increase in prowes great, and these shal chalenge those, I meane the brothers, which discend from parties of our foes, In meete appointed place to proue that Tetimes was slayne By treason false, of Aganes, who falsly did it faine, And if the brothers do consent to come in poynted place, And dare presume to meete my sonnes and looke them in the face, Wee wil ordaine the chiefest strength of al our noble bloud, To helpe my sonnes, if ought should chaunce to them more worse than good: And by this meanes, as by a shift when they are present there, We shal the Aganetians all suppresse, deuoyde of feare. To this, the Tetimetians glad, were very wel agreed. And therefore, shortly to conclude, it briefly was decreed Of al the Tetimetian route, that chalenge should be made Of Tetimetian brothers, who consenting, causde to vade A verlet dight in posting haste, to Aganetians trayne, Who did informe them of this thing, and then returnde againe. But none amidst the valiant route of Aganetians, more, Than Aganetian brothers ioyde, to heare of this before. For it was chiefly that they wisht, and therfore did prouide Eche requisite and needful thing for the appointed tide. And not vnlike to Lions fierce. who rage for wante of pray, They burnd and boylde in furies fire, til the appointed day, The which approcht, the furious youthes be mette in foresaide field, With barbed horse and steely cotes, and blade and speare and shield, And after course of rankrous talke, with staffe in steady wreast, Eche youth appointed, for his foe is now alredy prest. And traiterous Tetimetians they, as erst they did deuise, Were in ambushment priuie hid in secret, so likewise The Aganetians eke, vnknowne did closely couche in place, Where they suspecting of their foes and of the foresaide case Did lie, their nephewes to defend, if reason should assaile To worke them mischiefe, wherein much their watching did preuaile: For when eche youthful knight had met and buckled with his foe, Like thunder ratling in the skies which tumbleth to and fro, At last the Tetimetians force began to fainte and faile, The which when Aganetians spide, more fiercely did assayle Their foes, with ouercharging thwackes til Tetimetians route Espying those their nephewes fare, in hast did rushe them out From bushes, like to buskling boares, vpon the brothers twayne Of Aganetian kind, and thought the brothers to haue slayne: But Aganetians likewise hid, as furiously do meete, From couert bushes, these theyr foes, in their defence to greete, And now begins the stirre a newe, for euery man doth straine Himselfe with al his force and might, to put his foe to paine, But most surpassing all the rest, the prowesse, and renowne Of Pesistratus did excell, who so suppressed downe The rage of Tetimetians pride, that through his Martial might And manly courage, to conclude, they put their foes to flight. And then in better peace, than earst when they sustaynde anoy. They did retyre, with happy heartes and stomackes stuft with ioy, But woe to Fortunes tickle wheeles, who seemeth to aduaunce. When with hir froward kicking heeles she charmeth a mischaunce: Thou blubbered blind and bleared eyde, thou fond and fickle foole, Thou thrice and thriee accursed Wench, thou girle of Momus schole, Why doth thy sausie finger touch these manly Martiall knightes? Why doest thou so infect these youthes with thy impoysned spightes. Art thou not thrall: not thrall ywis: doth fortune eche thing guide? Why then, alas, attend to heare of this vnhappy tide. The Aganetians thus returnde from former feareful broyle, The conquest got, by knightly force in giuing foes the foyle, In season after sweete repast receiued, they deuise And mutually consented now, they purpose to surmise, How that the spoyle they haue obtaynd of foes, may parted bee Amongst themselues, and herevpon they seeke for to agree. But when as Kenedoxus viewde this purpose and intent, In hope to haue the whole himselfe and all the rest preuent. With forced voyce and fyled song, and hawtie glozing stile, He movde his speech as thus, and cravde attentiuenesse a whyle: You valiant impes and worthy limmes of Aganetians rase, Considering what you do intend and purpose in this case, I thinke my selfe the boldlier may proceede for to declare Such certaine things, as to be showne both good and needeful are. You know, of Aganetians I by duety do retaine The landes and lordships, which by right to me the heyre remaine: And now by cause we haue of foes by force possest a spoyle, Wherein, more landes we purchaste haue contained in this soyle, It seemeth requisite to mee, that I possesse the same, Bycause thereby it may enlarge the Aganetians fame. For if our lands should be disperst and not in one mans vse, In tract of time it would returne vnto our owne abuse: And therefore note what I shal say, let me the lande possesse, And what your partes amount vnto, I will the same addresse With ready paiments into golde, how answere you to this? None answerde but Pesistratus, who sayde it were amis That he should seeme so to incroche vpon the same, whose right. Was due to him by Sires bequest, if foes were woon by fight. Which when the Aganetians wayd. remembring it for true, That by the fire it was disposde for Pesistratus due, With one accord they did consent, that Pesistratus, he Should it enioy, as fathers wil hath graunted it to be. But Kenedoxus movde to wrath, with swelling face for ire, Did brast out these vnseemely words, and no wise would aspire: What value more hath bin resinde from Pesistratus part? Or manly prowesse, than of me and of my willing hart? Or why should such vnequal dole be offred for my paine? Since I my care, as much as he, haue vsde for to maintaine The Aganetians worthy fame, whose worthiest heire am I, And therefore hold it greatest skorne, that you should so denie To render me my rightful due, or strongly to withhold, My proper right, it likewise seemes, my brother is to bolde: Not bolde, quoth Pesistratus then, in seeking for mine owne, But you to bolde in wresting mine as it is well yknowne. Which wordes when Kenedoxus heard, with hautie spitefull hart He left them all, and rancrous ful did furiously depart. Repairing to his chamber, where deuoid of quiet rest, His raging braynes vnbridled boyle in fierce Alectos brest, And fuming in the furious fits which madnesse intertaine, As one distraught of sense and wittes, he puts himselfe to paine, In raging for to seeke reuenge in most despightful wise On Pesistratus, whose disease he ceaslesse doth deuise. But Aganetians musing much at Kenedoxus rage, And Pesistratus seeing it, desirous to aswage The same, with leaue requested, hies to Kenedox in hast, Where as approcht, his brother spies to mumble very fast Unto himselfe with rayling voyce on Pesistratus, who Perceiuing Kenedox, as madde to raile vppon him so, Had entring, thought by gentle words to molifie his ire, But Kenedoxus seing him, auoyde and come no nyer Quoth he, for (villaine) I will seeke as much thy great defame, As thou hast sought, in open sight of frendes to worke my shame. Yet Pesistratus (curteous knight) replide to him againe With gentle kind of humble speech, and sought for to refraine Himselfe from wrath: but Kenedox so furiously was bent Against Pesistratus, that fraught with fierce and fell intent, He drewe from secret sheath, as wo[illeg.], his desprate testie blade, Wherwith on Pesistratus, hee so fiercely did inuade, That had not Pesistratus stept from chamber dore in hast, His curteous heart of brothers blade had felt th'vnsauerie tast. But Pesistratus viewing this, with Rapior had in hand, Returnd againe to brothers face his rigor to withstand: And movde by this occasion iust to anger, caitife vile (Quoth hee) wouldst thou in brothers blood so cowardly defile Thy filthy fistes? and art thou meant to seeke thy friendes decay? If so, in a conuenient place and on appointed day Agree to get reuenge, and seeke thy quarell to renue, And I this blade in traiterous bloud of thine shal there imbrue: Wherewith eche partie did consent in poynted place to meete. And when the season was approchte, as time doth swiftly fleete, These youthes are met, prouided both, according to the time, With speare and shield, and bloudy blade, to tell eche others crime, Not with the tong, but Martial fist, in such vnfriendly sort, As eche did iudge his foe, no friend, or for to play in sport: But now began the broyle so hot, that who had seene the blowes, The deadly thrustes, the desperate foynes that eche to other showes, The battring bangs, and thumping thwacks that eche to other lent, With stayned fielde, of brothers bloud so carelessly dispent, He would haue ieast surmysde, that these should naturall brothers be, But rather friendes of Cerberus kynde, or impes of Hels decree: So furious fiersly did they deale, without remorse of life, Or nature, but respecting nought saue cause of former strife, Like Tigres fastening on their pray, the sought eche others death, Til both had laboured with such paine that they were out of breath: And then they breathd and fought afresh, and breathde and fought agayne, And neuer stint, til at the last there came with might and maine A great connent of armed knightes, who had in forrest by Bin chasing, through their martial feates a dragon monstrous hie, And of proportion wonderful, who long had brought to spoyle The corne and cattel therabout contayned in their soyle. And when the knights had from a farre espide these brothers fell, Eche so assaulting others life with bloudy blade to quell: With pricking spurre, they forward forst their bodies to be borne. And when approcht, they viewde the knights so batterd, taggde and torne With dint of sworde, it was no boote to bid them forward hie To part the foes, for it was done in twinckling of an eye. But Kenedoxus what through heate and want of breathing winde, And what through faintnesse of his wounds, be to the earth declinde As dead, for Pesistratus had impierst with cruel thrust, His shoulder through, whom when he viewd to grouel in the dust His heany hart was so agast and he in dumpes dismayde, Bycause he thought his brother dead, that thus with teares be sayde: O lucklesse wight, oh cursed youth, and hath this this my fist My brother slayne? and shal I liue? no, no, I wil vntwiste My vital knotte, and this the knife, which wrought my brothers death, Shall likewise pierce my cruel hart, and stop my vitall breath. And therewithal in desprate moode he set the hilts on ground, And thought with point of piercing knife to take his latest wound: But present knightes withdrew his hand from that vntimely acte, And sought how to perswade hym now, (since finisht is the fact) The he departe from natiue soyle into some forraine place, Whereas, deuoyde of further feare and daunger, he may passe His life in safetie, both from foe and peril of the lawe: To which Pesistratus agreed, when he the daunger saw, That woulde ensue vppon his case if he were bent to stay, And therefore speedily prepares and takes his ready way To secret place, where he might hide his woful head a space, Til season that he may conuey his steps to further place. But there arriued, woful man, his troubles so increase, And he so vexed is in griefes, which no wise he can cease, That al addrest to mourneful chere, his cares he doth discus, The which prouokte his forced penne, in verse to vtter thus: Oh heauie hart dismaid, To the tune of Damon &amp; pythias oh stomacke stuft with paine, Oh woful wight, oh cursed wretch, why shouldst thou not complaine? Art thou in pleasant state, or hast thou cause to ioy? No no, thy fates are frounst in feares, come death and ridde my ceasles anoy, Oh cruel carelesse wretch, doest thou deserue thy life, Since thou thy gentle brothers breast hast pearst with cursed knife? VVhat meanest thou to liue? and wilt thou life enioy? No no, thy fates are frounst in feares, come death and ridde my ceasles anoy You fatal sisters all, you twisters teare my threede, VVith fatall knife my fatal knott to share in hast proceede. For I vnhappie wretch am cleane exilde from ioy, And liue in woes, in griefes, and feares, come death and ridde my ceasles anoy And then the wretched heauy wight, doth spende the tedious tyme In plaintes and teares, and vexing griefes, bewayling former crime, In such a mourneful sorte, as who had seene the man in feares, To scald his pleasaunt youthful chekes with such excesse of teares, His heauy hart would yearning, melt to heare his woful mones, Whose griefes might moue the fixed starres or mollifie the stones. And yet (vncessant) doth he frounse his hart in these his woes, Regarding nought but wished graue his carcase to inclose: Whom, so dismayde in drousie dumpe amidst his cares I leaue, And now to Kenedoxus state my quil I must bequeaue. Oh heauy case, ambition should be cause of such anoy, That mutual bloudes should be disperst and so deuoyde of ioy: Oh haplesse chance, vnhappy thrice, how fel is greedie rage, That it should pester so the partes, which reason can not swage? Alas alas, ambition was't that kindled al this fire? And was't ambition which addrest the brothers so to ire? And was't ambition from the whence this greuous case so grew? Ambition was it, wherfore harke what did thereof insue. Pesistratus for feare thus fled, within a certaine space When dumpes auoyded, vital course returnde to proper place, Then Kenedoxus did reuiue, and musing very much To see so great conuent of knightes, full fraught with former grutch, His body raised from the ground in hast with desperate blade: As one distraught of reasons sense he fiercely did inuade The knightly troope there present, who dismaide to see the same, Yet wisely pondring that to strike it would be to their shame, Intreated often him to cease, pronouncing vowes, that they Were all his friendes, and minded least to seeke for his decay. Which waying, he perceyuing eke the man not present there, On whom he sought reuenge, and what more cause he had to feare, Soone stayde his handes, and gently then he gan for to request, What cause compeld their presence there, to be in armour drest. Who aunswerd, certifying him of al the former case: And how his brother they had sent into a forreine place, Bycause they feared he was dead, supposing it for best He should depart, than there to liue in daunger and vnrest: But oh the dolor that redoundes to Kenedoxus hart, Impleating euery vaine with griefe or rather deadly smart, When first he vnderstood the same, yet quickly was it layde, For gayne and ranckour did perswade so much, that soone he stayd Therefrom, bycause hys greedie hart had now the thing attaind, I meane the landes for which so much of trauaile he sustaind: Yet further thinking of the thing when he perused well, And saw that Pesistratus had the conquest as it fell, Bycause that he was left as dead: oh how did ranckour rage In broyling breast, as poysned fire whych floodes may not asswage: So fiercely freting did the fume of choler frame his ire, That if by suffraunce he might had the ful of his desire, He would for anger haue destroyed himselfe in desperate minde, Such was the scorneful pride wherto hys stomacke was inclinde. And twixt these passions, dolour so attempting him, quoth he, And is he fledde, and doth he thinke to skape and to be free By flight? no, no, though he suppose I am a senslesse corse, Ere it be long he shall abide and throughly feele my forse. And therwithall a spightfull vow in solempne wise he made, That tyme should nere content his harte till he with deadly blade Had pierced Pesistratus sides, whose then effused blood Should onely tend for to suffise his ire and do him good. Oh frendlesse frettes of hautie wrath, O impe of serpentes kinde, How could thy stomacke so desire, thy brothers life to blinde? What rest lesse rage assaulteth thee, what strange disguised sort Of diuelish Gods, constraine thy wil such lewdnesse to support? Thy brother doth complaine, to thinke of thine vnhappy fate And his vnkindnesse, thinking him in more vnhappy state. And with excesse of piteous teares, and blubberings, sighes, and cryes: The lothsome tedious tyme he weares, in a most mornefull wise. And not so much for his exile, as doubt of thy misfare, Yet thou accursed, onely sekst and dost employ thy care To bring thy brother to his ende, regarding nature nought, Nor yet the concord which by right of brother should be sought. Oh woful hearing, what a thing is this, that such a knight As Pesistratus, fraught with grace, with vertues, and with might, Who long may liue in quiet rest: to do his country good: Should so by ranckrous spight be forst, to flee from natiue brood? The cause of mone is very much. and it disturbes me stil: Yet now compeld to leaue my teares, I must ordaine my quill To further thy deserued fame, Pesistratus thou kinde, Whose praise I wish were printed plaine in euery bodies minde. The hautie pride of ranckrous rage, turmoyling thus in breast Of Kenedox, when spiteful wordes by tract of time were ceast, Associated with the route, of foresayde hunters trayne, He is arriued at pallace where; he wonted to remaine: And he no sooner seysed had his footesteps in the towne: But it was rifely blowne abrode, and spred for true renowne That Kenedoxus was approcht, and almost dead through wounds, The which as by report to al, so likewise it resoundes Unto the hearing of his freindes and kinsmen, who agast, With speedy trauel did prouide to visite him in hast: And present viewing how the wight was dyed in his bloud, Wherein he wallowed as a beast: bycause they vnderstoode Nothing of former case, as how, Pesistratus had sped His brother so: nor how for feare of daunger he was fled: With musing much they did demaund, of his vnlucky fare: To whome the circumstance of all did Kenedox declare, Which vttred in dispightful sorte and in a raging wise, With blasted face and stamping feete: his kinsmen did surmise, And wisely pondred of the case: which well pervsing, they Perceivde that Kenedox was cause of this vnhappy fray, Wheron they chiefly did repute to Kenedox the blame, Who fiercely fuming more in frets did rage to heare the same: And they aggreued for to thinke of Pesistratus exile, Were euen as fiercely bent againe to rough and raging stile. Wheron eche partie was displeasde: for Kenedox was mad, To see his brothers case bewaylde when he the worser had: And they lamenting, ?rued? the time that they had lost the wight, I meane Pesistratus, whose helpe was all their chiefest might: And therupon such taunting checkes and wordes from euery side Proceded forth, that greeued they no longer would abide With Kenedox, but curst his pride, and iudgde him for their foe: As likewise he no otherwise of them esteemde but so. And thus departed they, whom now as cause addrest to ire: So cause to Pesistrate doth moue, my pen for to retire, The only reaper of the praise, and gainer of the fame: Which this my simple rude discourse, indeuors to proclame. Who thus by fortune forst to hide, his head in little space: Prouided wel for to conuey, himselfe to further place. For as it fel, a vessel riggde, and redy drest to ride, Towards Italian coastes, was there the very selfe same tide That he arriued at the place, wherto before he fled: Whereof the woful man was glad, that he so wel had sped, And therefore briefly did conclude with sailer for his hire: The which agreed with prosperous winde, and tide to their desire. They set aloofe, and hoysed sayles, and daunst amidst the seas, With easie, calme, and pleasant streames at their desired ease. But Pesistratus he alas, for all these foresaide things: Could not vnwrap him selfe from cares, or such pernitious stings As troubled him through former fact, but ceaslesse did lament His curssed crime, which with excesse of teares be did repent. Yet at the last when fansies fill, he tumbled had in braine: He somwhat left for to distil his teares, and to complaine, And gathered stomacke, as behoues a man in such a case: For to retaine, though with much paine, as Pesistratus was. And therfore he auoyding greefes, and setting cares apart: Considering what was requisite, with courage fraught his hart, And craued aid with crouching knees, of mightie loue his hand: Desiring comfort might preuaile his dolour to withstand. Which prayers made, as one renewd, and now no more anoyde: He felt his burdened hart more light and cleane of cares deuoyde. And therefore thanking mighty Ioue for sodaine such reliefe, He cleane forsakes his drousie dumpes and doth disdaine his griefe: And with a cheereful brayne prouides hys voyage to forecast, Supposing of the things to come, and not of matters past. And seekes to recreate his sense, and to refreshe his minde, With spending tyme in pleasant sort and sportes of comely kinde. Wherto Aurore and Tytan both do seeme for to agree With pleasaunt golden glittering rayes whych mutual splendant bee. As eke the siluer surging streames, which likewise seeme to play In pleasant sort with Titans beames which beutifide the day. And thus the season seeming fit, in tract of time at last, With helpe of Zephyrs gentle breath, their iourney ouerpast. They arrivde in ?consanes? of Italian partes with ease, Where as approcht, Pesistratus doth safely leaue the seas, And takes his way to certaine place, where he was bent to bide, Till season that he might deuise a maister to prouide, Whom he might serue, supposing so to spende his tedious dayes: Yet hoping wel in tract of time to finde some other wayes To purchase credite, wherby he might happier fate attaine: Where inpervsing thus, he thought to vse therin his paine. Alas what cause thou woful wight hast thou to make thy mone? How canst thou brooke? to serue a knight, since thou thy selfe was one Of woorthy fame, and prowesse more in Gretia soyle containd: How may thy nusled custome bee by neede so much restraind: How canst thou frame thy selfe to crou[illeg.] since crouching vnto thee, It was thy duetie to receiue the crouch of cap and knee? How canst thou suffer for to leaue, the silken robes of thine: And now thy tender corps, to weedes of basenesse to refine? How canst thou gnaw of refuse bones, when wont it was thy trade, To feede of sweetest sauouring meates, that ioyly iunckets made? How canst thou beare the taunting check of maisters common vse: Or how can stomacke be content, to liue in such abuse? How mayst thou brooke the felowship, of simple seruile kinde: Or how mayst thou forbeare so much, for to subdue thy minde: Since all the routes of courtly traine, were seruile vnto thee, And redy prest to execute the wil of thy decree? Howe mayst thou frame to weare in ste of golden linked chaine, About thy necke, in bondage yoke, of seruitude and paine? Yes yes, thou canst, thy gentle hart is voide of hautie pride: And thou as wel canst ease deny, as it hath thee denide. And take thy fortune as it fals, thou canst forbeare the same: Wherfore I shall addresse my pen, thy vertues to proclame. And thys my verse though not as wel, as faine I do desire, Bycause it wrought in Plutos forge is tride with scarce good fire, Yet shal indeuor to proceede, to paint thy further prayse In ful effect, who so wil heare, though not with hautie praise. Pesistratus in former plight, and place abiding stil, Expecting for a seruice such as might content his wil. Considering of his doubtful state, and case, perceiued playne That there to stay, it were a thing but frustrate and in vaine. And therefore he departed thence, where first he did ariue: Well hoping of a fitter place, where better he should thriue: And as he trauelde, fortune so by fauour brought to passe, That wandring witlesse vp and downe, not knowing where he was: There dwelt an auncient Hermite by, in Sabels all yclad, With hoary beare, and countnaunce graue, of gesture very sad, Whom Pesistrate espying soone, prepared for to meete: And after met in curteous wise, and maner did he greete: And after greeted, did disclose, the summe of all his care, Requiring Sire to haue remorse, to hys vnlucky fare: Desiring further that he would vouchsafe to entertaine Him in his seruice, wherein he did vow to vse his paine. To whom with gentle speech the Sire did curteously reply, That he was bent to liue alone, as likewise so to die: But viewing both the seemely shape, the countenaunce and the grace Of Pesistrate, in tract of time when he had paus'd a space: My Sonne (quoth he) I pittie much the cause of thine anoy, And would to god my power could streetch, to worke thy further ioy: But if my simple cottage may suffise thee for to please, And to remaine with me my sonne, thou thinke it for thine ease, My hart contented is to graunt, therin thy whole request: As likewise for to pleasure thee, in ought else am I prest. For which Pesistratus did thanke a thousand times the Sire, That he vouchased so to graunt the thing he did require. And thus a punie Hermite he become, they did repayre Unto their little cottage by, auoyding open aire. Where as refection taken they as earst returne to walke Againe: and then the Sire begins, in former wise to talke. Demaunding Pesistratus, why he left his natiue soile: Who blanke to speake, yet fearing least he purchase should a toyle, Deuisde a shift: and as he thought to speake, in boysterous haste A Lion fierce with stamping feete who therby had bin crast, Came flinging fiersly towardes them, with open roaring voice And gaping mouth and staring eyes, and fearefull thundring noise. Whom when they spide, the father feard, began to cry: Oh knight, Thou hast deceiued me, wheron the Saints do beare me spight, But Pesistratus wel aduisde, preparde his sword and shielde, The whych in iorney he had borne, and brought into the field. And with a courage met the beast, in such a rigorous sort, That plaine by force, he set his tayle on ground, for al hys port. And further fiersly so attempt, that with his testy blade He spils in twayne his hart, before recouery could be made. And whilst so manfully be dealt, the chasers folowing fast, Were present come, who viewing this, were wondrously agast. This only one durst so assault, the best whych they before Durst not inuiron or attempt, without at least a skore. And feared sire, when he so sawe, the valiantnesse of hart In Pesistrate, began to cry, S. George is of our part. And with a thousand yelded thankes he gratified his paynes Desiring pardon for his wordes, when erst he, did complaine. And Pesistratus thus attaind, the conquest of the beast: Which after was the chiefest cause, that set his hart at [illeg.] For in the route of the conuent of chasers, was a knight Of prowesse great, and valure like, who Pecipater hight: He bare the most and chiefest sway in countries therabout, But chiefly in Tarentum towne a citie voyde of doubte: Because it florisht through the meanes of Pecipater, who Beholding Pesistrate his fight, hys strength and courage so, Was mou'd with inward burning zeale of fauour to retaine: As though his loue were ready prest to quite Pesistrates paine. And therefore, when othe victory by Pesistrate attainde, Eche turmoyle cast the caging beast, by force was so restrainde. Wyth comely grace on coursors corps. he Pesistrate doth meete: Whom wyth aboundant curtesie, the gentle knight did greete, And after salutations made to him and to the sire, He doth of Pesistratus straight, with frendlynesse require, By what aduenture he was driuen to meete the chased beast? Who did enforme him of eche thing, and aunswere his request, With no lesse grauitie than words, in seemely order set, And gesture courtly, comely grace and comelinesse as great, Which Pecipater noting well and liking, did deuise In semblant sort, to vtter that his fansie did surmise To craue, which was in fellowship Pesistrate to retayne: Whose peerelesse prowesse be esteemde eche mortal wightes to staine. In season therfore fitte assignde, he moues with pleasant stile, His frendly wordes, and thus saide he, it were a great exile. My friende Pesistratus that we by happy fortune met, Should part, whose presence neyther cause nor season seemes to let: But not so much exile, as griefe and dolour vnto mee, Who should esteeme thy presence left, my selfe not to be free. But thral to care, such is the zeale that stirreth my desire To craue thy presence, wherfore yelde to that I do require. I can not chuse saide Pesistrate, but very well suppose Of al the profred friendship which so friendly you disclose. But yet the basenesse of my birth, and barenesse of my state, And rudenesse of my persone, seeme vnfitte for such a mate, Which be the motions that compel me boldly to deny (My pardon cravde) for to assent thus to presume so hie, As match the mate, whose bondage may beseeme my seruile kinde More better farre, than for to yelde, to your desirous minde. Yet Pecipater could not be suffised with the same, Nor iudged the abasing of himselfe to be defame: But was importunate the more to haue him to agree: Wherto Pesistratus wyth thankes did yeld, when he did see The gentle valure that was shrinde in Pecipaters brest, And ioyde in hart to thynke his state was setled at such rest: That where as earst an exilde wight, he wandred vp and downe, He now a rulers mate hath reapt by fortune such renowne, And thus agreed, they do repayre with sire to cottage by, Where as a while they did prouide, their weary lymmes to lye At more of ease, and then refresht, with taken leaue of Sire, Unto Tarentum whence they came they buskled to retire. Wyth whom Pesistrate worthy knight departing: toke his leaue Of foresayde Sire, whose wish the like to god did hym bequeaue. And now ech praunser ready prest, with ech thing furnisht fit: As tracking trappers, saddels trimme, and large restrayning bit: The lusty valiant youthful knightes, proceede with stamping pace And portly gesture, towardes that the sayd desired place, And mouing talke of hunters trade, they reason of their game, Wherby Pesistratus was knowne as expert in the same, As present any, whereon eche did iudge and deeme his race, More rather rightly to proceed of royall bloud than base. Whose comely countenaunce pleased so eche wight, that eche man thought Himselfe a happy mate, that fate had such companion brought. But Pecipater happiest hee, esteemde amongst the rest Himselfe, that what he chiefest sought, such fortune had addrest: And thus eche partie well content, such friendlynesse doth flowe From euery side, that Pesistrate lets foresaide sorrowes go: And only now deuiseth he their curtsies to requite: And thus whilest tract of time by stealth, had taken proofe of flight, And they approched had their pace, vnto Tarentum nie, Pecipater a varlet sendes before, for to discry The conquestes wonne, and that hys wil was eche man should prepare Against hys presence seemely showes, their conquestes to declare. Which message done by varlet, was prouided in the towne: For triumphe eche thing redy fitte pretending great renown: As valiant route of armed knights, with glistering helmes and shieldes: And blazing banners set aloft, in turrets, fortes, and fieldes, And trumpets sounding vp triumph, and drummes pretending fame: And iangling belles with Musikes arte, wel placed in the same. And diuers well deuised toyes, and sundry pleasant sightes, Attendant ready for the fame of these triumphant knightes. And al the chiefe and nobles there, assembled were likewise In decent order for the nonce, eche thing was so precise, Amidst the which, the royal race of Pecipaters blood, The hiest roome and worthiest place possessing: seemely stood, Their worthy kinsman to salute wyth such aduised prayse, As doth behoue for worthye wyght which hath deserued prayse. Whych was so passing pleasant sight, as could be wisht no more: For both of lusty youthful knightes, and glittering dames such store, Were present, as in Tarent towne, the like was neuer sene: Nor yet in all Italian costes, no better could haue bin. Yet most surpassing all the rest, in beauties beames as farre, As glittering glee of Phebes forme, furmountes the twinckling starre. Was present one, a certaine dame, who Catanea hight, The sister to Pecipater, a peerelesse gemme by right: For seemely such she was, as though shee framed were in molde: With equall grace, so equal matcht, as tong may not vnfolde. Here beauty, blazing more in sight, within hir angelike face, Than in the skies, the golden rayes of Tytans raumping race. Such perfect feature firmely fixt within hyr secret frame: As though by right, dame Nature scornde. she chalendge endlesse fame, With curteous countenaunce, comely corps, and portrature demure, So rare that Gods might seeme to bow hir fansie to procure. And so indude in euery point, with natures speciall giftes, As though shee onely perfect wrought, eche else by fayned shiftes. This Nimphe with al the foresayde route, now ready do remaine: Expecting for the presence of hir brother and his trayne. And viewing thus at last, she spies the knightes approched nie: Wheron eche thing prouided proues his prowes for to trie: For trumpets sound, and shalmes recorde, and cornets quiuer fast, To gratifie the conquerors with sweete saluting blast. And euery thing reioycing, seemes to make a pleasant tide. Wherein the seemely knightes be come. and they arriued ride In decent order, prauncing fast, on corps of comely steede: Which satisfide eche eyesight well, his fansie for to seede: For first the youthfull valiant knights, conducting praunst before, In seemely ranke and portly grace as doth behoue therfore, And then Pecipater in midst, with Pesistrate proceedes, By certaine signe pretended wel the proofe of eche mans dedes: For Pecipater had a head of wylde and tusked Bore, Which he hymselfe by force had slayne, transported him before: And Pesistrate of Lyon fierce, the great and grislie ded Which he had slaine, as erst was sayde, before hys courser led. And thus in Tarent stretes arivde, the people al reioyce, To see such valiant sight, wheron was moude so great a noyse, As though with th?ks they wold haue rais'd the Conquerours to skies, So glad the people for their praise, did moue such lofty cryes. But euery wight that marked well, Pesistratus his grace, His feautred limmes so sightly set, and pight in equal place, As though the Gods had all agreed to frame of earthly molde, In humaine forme a wondrous worke, for nature to beholde: Not little musing, praised much his valure in their minde: Whose peere in euery poynt they iudge, a man should neuer finde. And stil proceeding forwarde thus, at last they came to place, Wheras remainde the royal troupe, of Pecipaters race. To whom they vsde reuerence such, as like was vsde againe, With modest countnance, to the route of Pecipaters traine. But when Pecipater hymselfe, with Pesistratus was Therto approcht who then had seene the curtesie did [illeg.] From part to part, he would haue thought Minerua had indude: Their seldome seene behauioure there, with none such gestures viewd. So courtly countnaunce did vnfolde the meanings of the minde: Pretending outwardly wherto the senses were inclinde: And after salutations thus concluded, to the praise Of Pesistrate Pecipater to Catanea sayes: If one surpassing other eche, a peerelesse may be hight: This youth possest wyth carest giftes, deserues the name by right: Indude with courage, fraught with truth abounding ful of fame. And natures gift is so seldome seene as fewe retaine the same. Wheron hys person greeting well, to Pesistrate she saide: His presence welcome, thrise and thrise, but silly he dismaide To viewe the seldome beuties blaze appearing in hir face, And eke hir [illeg.] protrature, and correspondent grace: As spite of wits [illeg.] fraught did stande, infected at the hart: With Venu and poisned point of Cupides fiery dart: And had no power to moue his speech, his tong was so restraind: Nor render thanks his nummed sense was so in secret painde. Yet pausing time returning strength, such harte thanked quoth he, I yelde and wish, as by my tong they may not vtterd be. Which well shee weyed, marking eke, how course of bloud did change, Is likewise wistly viewd his vaynes, in panting wise to raunge: Yet all the rest suspected least therof, but onely waide The comely answere which to hir, in seemely wise he sayde. For which in minde eche did commend hym much, pretending so In curteous wise as he could deeme, in presence none a foe: And then in one conuent they went to Pecipaters place, There for to vse such meete repastes, as fitted for the case. And Catanea she alone with Pesistrate did walke, Who by occasion movde, did vse such sober friendly talke, As either partie liked well, wheron their stomackes flame In mutuall loue, and Cupides fire, proceeding in the same, In zealous wise, though that vnknowne it was to either, how The others hart to eithers wil, was redy for to bow. And thus eche trapped in the snare, of sodaine seemely sight, Theyr fansies feeding on the baites, of further loues delight. When voyage finisht, they are come to Pecipaters place, Ech gift well greeted as behoues, such curtsie for the case, And Pesistrate lyke welcom'd: they perseuer further still, Wyth filed tong, and pleasant stile, to please ech others wil. Tyl such time as season did their appetites require, With natures nourishment to feede their natural desire. The which approcht, prouided wel, such delicates they haue, Of euery commendable kinde, as hart no more might craue. It were a folly therfore that I further should pretend: For to describe their sumptuous feast, and to afrustrate ende. Bycause in few words may it serue, the whole for to disclose: It was as delicate and fine, as fansie might suppose. This matter [illeg.] I wil proceede for to proclame This Pesistratus worthy prayse, and Cataneas fame. Of whom my purpose toke in hand, with pen for to endite Their sodaine loue, and constant faith to set in open sight. When feast was finisht, and the day intending to his ende: Sir Titan leaues his splendant streames, a while for to extende. The guestes with rendring harty thankes, be redy to repayre, Eche to hys home, as cause did moue their presence to be there. And Catanea with them bent, in likewise to departe Hir brother left (who wisht hir yet to stay wyth willyng hart,) Did minde to wend to dwelling place, where wonted she remainde, Of vncle hyrs, who from her youth, in vertues had hir traynd To present age, yet not forgot, she takes desired leaue, Whom Pecipater to the Gods tuition did bequeaue. And then to Pesistrate the frames hir speach in gentle wise: Well wishing to his person health, and so the homeward hies. But who had seene the countenance of Pesistratus when he, Perceiud he must forgo the sight, which most he craude to see. He would haue thought the silly man, were redy prest to dye: His heauy dolefull gestures so his sorowes did discrie. Which she perceyuing, could not chuse but blush and was abasht. Wherby hir ruddie rising bloud, in countnance fully flasht At first: but afterwarde hir hart for sorrow waxing colde. No bloud at all hir paled face, by any meanes could hold. And thus the louers at the last departing, heauy cheare, Did force eche of [illeg.] inward thought at large for to appeare: Though certaynly it was not knowne, to eche: of others loue, Bycause experience had not tride, in season it to proue: But ioy my happy fate to thinke, of curtesie I finde Of you, and long to see the day, whereby may be resignde Some part of recompence for this, your friendly friendship found: Which well I may suppose in none more amply to abound. And when the place auoyded thus, of guestes no more remainde, But Pesistrate, whose heauy hart, was so by griefe restrainde, From comfort cleane, Pecipater, espying him alone, Demaundeth why he was so sad, and seemed for to mone: The whom sayd Pesistrate, my Lord I haue no cause to waile: Nor yet occasion that with greefe my stomacke should assaile. The recompence already done, (quod Pecipater) is: And therefore friend Pesistratus, surmise no more of this. But thinke: as Saintes do witnesse beare, that for to do thee good, I minded am in thy behalfe, to spend my proper bloud: If therfore that thou shouldst misdoubt hereof, what might be sayde: But that I should with teares lament the same, and so he slayd To speake: and Pesistrate he led from thence to chamber by, Which was prouided for the nonce, his weary limmes to lye. Where Pecipater further did, hys friendlinesse protest, Desiring him therefor his case to vse his quiet rest. For which Pesistratus did thanke, both with his mouth and minde, Hys gentlenesse a thousand times, and then to couche declinde. And Pecipater did depart: but when a little space Pesistratus had line on bed, reuoluing of his case, He was so vexed silly man, that nothing could appease Or once asswage his sorowes, but increasing hys disease, He thinkes of Catanea, who hath so in fetters yokt His louing heart, that all his ioyes to thraldome are prouokt. And he supprest to bondage like, and so the miser lies Bewayling such his wretched fates, with sundry plaintife cries. And when he thinkes, how much vnlike he is to get reliefe: The more in doubt and deepe dispaire increaseth still his griefe: And thus dismaid, in diuers dumps he lyes, and woful wight Dyspaires, and yet he hopes, but feares least time should worke despight. And wrapped in the dulled drouse, which fortune hath assignde Unto his pay, a thousand thoughts surmising in his minde: His turmoylde wits inforced so, his sorowes to discusse, Did vrge hys faultring tong at last with paine to vtter thus: Ah wretch, what friendlesse fates be thine, thou curssed catife thrise: How feltst thou fortunes froward force? how do thy cares arise? How canst thou suffer such anoy? how maiest thou more forbeare Such griping greefe, wyth pinching pangs so vehemently to teare Thy hart in sunder? yelde thy knife from thy vnhappy hande, To rid thee from such vexed life, thy dolors to withstand, For banished from natiue soyle, thou liv'st an exile here, And yet art bridled with the yoke of pensiuenesse and feare, Tormented with the sodaine sights, and trapped in the snare, Of one who skornes thy loyall loue, and least regardes thy care. Alas what therefore shouldst thou do, but to thy death consent: Since fortune doth, and season least to thy releefe relent? Wo worth the curssed time when breath. was yelded vnto thee In mothers wombe, would poyson had more rather bin thy fee. Wo worth the tyde, when to the world, of mother thou wast borne: Would then thy childish tender limmes, had bin to tatters torne. Wo worth the foode that euer since, thy nature hath sustainde. Wo woorth the nursse that from mishap, thy youthful age restraind. To worth the craking cradle which was rocked for thine rase: Would eche disport had bin addict thy humor to displease. Wo worth that ere thou wast aduaunst in natiue propre soile: Would God thy brothers handes had giuen to thee thy latest foyle. Wo woorth the curssed fist which wrought thy brothers fatall paine. Which was the cause that brought thee here, and moues thee to con plaine. Wo woorth the vessel whych conueyd, thy corps to present place: Neptunus crase his seemely sides, and all his sailes deface. What should I cursse and further say, to rid me of my smart: But death dispatch my lothed life, and furie brast my hart. But brainlesse foole why cursse I thus my selfe, and cry out so: More seemely were it that I blist my selfe, and curst my fo, Who is the cause of all this griefe, and worker of my paine: Why should I not with taunting tong, hir wily baites disdaine, Which hath my senses so deceiude, and yelded such anoy, Unto my pay, that in despaire I liue deuoyde of ioy. Oh Pesistrate, art thou to learne, of womens wonted willes? Art thou to knowe, that sooner none the sheep, than Foxe begiles? Art thou vnskilfull of the trade of womans wanton lure? Hast thou not hard what fond conceites, their practisde slights procure? Yes, yes, renue to memorye their ticklenesse of will: Their poysned lookes, their fained grace, their counterfaited skil, I trow thou needst not to be taught, their practise is so playne: That women all by kinde are bent, and nature, for to fayne. For if she view the personage, which doth please hir in hir mind. Then seekes shee to display hir snares, as in familiar kind. And if consenting he pretend, [illeg.] vse hir in likewise, Euen seemes she coy, and stranger streight and is as much precise. If humble he, then hauty she, and seemes to scorne his sute: But if he coy, then hateth she, and frowning standeth mute. And if intrapped, he bewayle to hir his carefull fate. She seemes to muse, what loue should mean and laughes at his estate. But if she loue, and he dispise to put the like in vre: Then labors she by suttle slights, his fansie to procure. Which got, she seemes for to reiect, regarding nought at all: But ioyes and iudgeth it a sport, to purchase him a fall, Shame therfore so to set thy minde, on such despised toyes, Which hinder wealth, and moue defame, and breede thee such anoyes. And settle wits to such aduise, as may prouide thee rest: From louely fits for reason seemes such fondnesse to detest. Suppose the Lady whom thou lou'st were ment for to requite Thy loyal loue with loue againe, were this thy cheefe delite? Forgettest thou the vnfaithfulnesse of Helen, who forsoke Hir spoused Menelaus, and to Paris hir betoke? Or falsed faith of Cresseda, whom Troylus serued long Remember how these fickle dames, did worke their louers wrong: And let the griefes of Troylus, and Cresseds wauering minde, Be warning to thy louing fits, least like requite thou finde. And seeke in time to bridle will, least after some repast Of pleasure had, thy griefes renue a thousande times as fast. What say I, should I leaue my loue and Catane forsake? Or should my fansie cease so soone, or seruice thus aslake? And should I now despise the dame, whom earst my zelous hart So lov'd, that for hir sake it could sustaine eternall smarte? No, no, the fire shall loose his might the sunne his golden glee, And heauens their hew, before such thought surmised be of mee: For curteous nature, gentle grace, and seemelynesse abounds, So rifely, as to euery eare it famously resoundes: With feature such as Venus shee, hir selfe may not compare, Or once presume in equal sorte hir vertues to declare. Nor Dian for hir chastitie, to match hir virgins race, Nor once Minerua vouchsafe wil to set hir selfe in place, Not onely this, but eke of hye and famous stocke shee springs, Wherto as reputation like, dame Fame dayly forth brings: Since therfore thus she wanteth nought. that fansie may require, How mad man I from such a dame, to bridle my desire: And how to blame for to reproch the comely courteous kinde Of women, since such heauenly giftes they do possesse in mind. But oh alas, accursed wight, why thinke I of hir hue: What doth it bote hir worthy state or birth for to renue? What doth the lodged vertues in hir tender gentle brest Prouoke my ioy, or noble byrth, intend to worke my rest? No whit at all, but those things most compel me to misfare, And depely drowne me in misdoubt, and dubble all my care. For since she wanteth nought at al, the which I seeme to craue. But doth possesse eche nedefull gift, that more she may not haue: The more inferiour do I seme to hir, whose royall grace My simple byrth in scorning sort may utterly deface. And do dispaire when eche respect, I ponder in my minde: As thinking of hir hauty state: how basely mine inclynde. For where she come of noble line, doth liue with honored name, I silly wretch in exile state, do purchase nought but shame: And she determind, at hir case doth liue in wished ioy? I poorely spend the troublous time, misdoubting more anoy. Alas, alas, why thinke I then of this, since playne I see, Hir birth, hir state and vertues rare so vnfit for my degree? Or why presume I so to match my selfe wyth royall race, Why? wel I may presume, bycause I liue in hope of grace. In hope of grace? why blynded foole, doth grace grow from disdaine? No skorne of hope: yes skorne of force in hautie harts remaine: In hauty harts I do agree, but in a gentle brest Doth fauor flow, and hautie skorne is vtterly supprest. But is thy Lady lowly such? yea certesse: can loftie state Agree to match with simple slaue and make decay his mate? Yea Cupid forceth Keysars bende, and layeth Princes pride: Yet knowst y? not thy Ladyes minde, bycause thou hast not tryde. Then trye I wil: how darst thou trye? my hope prouokes me so, What cause of hope hast thou? beware thy hope is most thy foe. Hir outwarde shape is cause inough, my hope for to maintaine: Through sightly bait the silly fish receiues his latest baine: Alas then death to thee I yeeld: thus sayde the woful wretch, And therwithall his lothed limmes he gan abrode to stretch: And through his greefe the sincking smarte that sucked through his vaines Distild the water to his hart which so increast his paines, That silly senses ouercome he fainteth to the ground: And dampish humor lothsome life inclosed in a swound In time when vitall course redound according to his kinde: His sprites reuivde, but yet his griefes were printed in hys minde. And raising then himselfe againe vpon his toused bed, He layes his weary limmes to muse, and rest his heauy hed. But rest disdaynes his furious frets, and hope doth scorne his helth: And nought doth happen to his hope that might renue his welth. And thus in painful plight the time maintaines his lingring life: He wishing only vital twist, were cut by fatall knife, And hauing no disport ne cause of comfort in his care: The more he striues, the more hee is intangled in the snare. And therefore patiently perforce he takes his chaunced fate: And wallowes in his woes as doth behoue a louers state: And then he thinkes of Catane, supposing of hir grace: Whose comely countnaunce minding wel, his fansie sees hir face, And ponders of hir friendly lookes, as [illeg.] seemely cheere: And doth imagine of hir shape, as though she had bene there, In present sight he printed so hir feature in his thought, As if Apelles through his Arte, hir picture had ywrought. Then dreames his humor, that he makes, to Cresside his complaint, And shewes his cause and case, as how hir beautie did attaint His simple senses at the first, which streight subdued were, Unto hir yoke, as seruile slaues to harme, to hope, and feare. And now the passing pangs, that hee sustayned for hir sake, He tels, and how his diuers doubts, do cause his hart to quake. And then he sues and craues for grace, to purchase at hir hande His ful request, for to be losd from bondage and hir band. And then he thinkes his Lady seemes some fauor for to showe, But out of this amaze his wits reuiude, when he doth know That only fansie fedde his feare, and no such thing to bee As he ymaginde in his harte, or thought his eye should see. The griesly griping gulfes and rage, that broyled in his brest: And qualming coldes did so agreeue, and worke him such vnreast, The siely wretch his vitall course distempered, he declynd, As one, who to the heauens againe his spirits had resinde. And stil, as ofte as he reuivd, he faynted downe againe. And thus the thrice vnhappy man was turmoyld in his payne, Whilest lucky fortune draue, by chance, Pecipater to please, Where Pesistratus was diseasde and [illeg.] in such case. Whom viewing he with shriking cryes did moue so hye a voyce, That Pesistrate from former traunce, reuyued through the noyse. To whom Pecipater did strayne his wofull speech, and sayd: Alas, Pesistratus my friend, what ceasles cares vpbrayde Thy youthful race, that vexed thus, thou spendst thy woefull dayes, In ceaslesse plaintes, in mones and teares, and seekes no other wayes For to auoyde the cause of griefes? whence commeth this thy care? What thing doeth cause? what wight hath wrought thy dul vnlusty fare? And so he stint, and skalding teares distilling on his brest, Pesistrate sayde. let not my greefes be cause of thine vnrest My Lord: for ten times cursed I, haue forsing cause to waile, Yet not for present cause whiche should my woful hart assaile: But thinking on such matters past as in my country done, My vanquisht stomacke much displeasde was so by dolour won, The which inforst me to complayne: nought els my Lord surmise, But let this serue (quoth Pesistrate) your fansy to suffise. By thys excuse was he dissolvde, that nought should moue his griefe, But matters past, and therefore seekes to yeelde him some reliefe, As might intend for to expel Pesistrats thoughtfull care. The which allurde his heauy hart to somewhat better fare. Yet though a little were decreast the torments of hys payne, The countenance of Catane, was buried in his braine: And thus he frounst amidst his thought and feeding fansies fyl. I leaue a whyle, and shal resigne to Catane my quyll. Whose drowsy dumps, whose dainty douts, whose fickle fits, whose feares, Whose grisly goulfes and piteous playntes, whose sobbes, whose sighes and teares, To paynt at large, you Furies teach, you Nimphes dispose my style, Apollo guyde, Minerva minde my mazed muse a whyle, Departed from hir brothers place, arriued when she was Where she remaynde, in secret wise to closet dyd she pas, Where all alone, surmising of the matters past of late, She gan to muse, how Pesistrate by sodayne bappie fate, Should meete hir brother as he did: and musing thus in thought, By Cupides force, in fansies fire, attend what thing was wrought. Forsaking to respect the chaunce, perusing in her minde Pesistrats comelynesse, she thought in what a courteous kinde He did salute hir, when at first she viewd his friendly face. And how in sodaine sort, his bloud did course from place to place. And thus respecting of his change, hir fansie did consent, That if he lovde, the like of hir for euer should be meant. For why? pervsing eche respect that nature had bestowde, She sayd in minde, in Pesistrate that al these vertues flowde. And thinking of his portlynesse, shee could not but suppose His comely gesture to excel: and thus hir thoughts arose So long as til at last insnarde, like little fishe on hooke, Who long hath playd with pleasant bayte and in the ende is tooke, She is restraind, hir freedome lost, and had no power to starte, But firmely vowd and fixed hath to Pesistrate hir harte. And thus consented to this new and firie zelous loue, From whence no power she could attayne hir fansie to remoue, She toombled hir diseased corps on couch, to ease hir minde? To whom Mercurius, Sopor hath in sodayne sorte resinde: And strykin with the drousie rodde, the winged fellow showes To hir in dreame Pesistratus, whose countenaunce wel she knowes, Of whom she thought she did receiue a ring of purest golde, With bloudy letters therein gravde, the which when she did hold, Did seeme to blede excessiuely, and al hir fist defilde, Wherein, Mercurius fled away and Sopor cleane exylde, She waking straynd hir slender throte in such a piteous wise, As well I deeme hir sighs and sobbes did pierse the hyest skyes: Yet seing that it was but dreame, contented somewhat more She stayd a whyle, but knowing wel the fearefulnesse before, Her passions then beginne a new, and ceasles she complaynes, With heauy mones &amp; trikling teares increasing double paynes, And gan of eche especiall poynt to ponder and surmise, As of the ring, and of the bloud, but nought she could deuise That might maintayne the token good of bloud that did distil, Wheron not able for to rule hir selfe, nor guyde hir wil, Through vexing griefe hir carefull thought suppressing senses force, She lyes in traunce as though distraught of lyfe, like senselesse corse: And when as vitall course returnd, in former plight she spendes The time renewd, and ceasseth not, but earnestly she sendes Hir sobbes and sighes from laden hart: yet after season past, When tract of tyme delayed had the fiercenesse of the blast, Wherby the stomacke more at ease was somewhat more at rest: She pondring further of the thing, began much to detest The former rashnesse of hir loue, accompting it a shame, That erste hir tickle will was bent to such deserued blame: Wheron for griefe that such abuse had blinded wandring wits, Hir tong was movde amidst the rest of these hir diuers fittes, To paint despight, in such a sorte with scorneful taunts conuayde, As might suffise for fansies case, and thus the Lady sayde: If reason ought for to perswade the foolishnesse of wil, Or wise forcast to teach the trade that doth ingender yll, Or counsell leade the weakling wittes, whom knowledge doth not guide, Or else experience shew the proofe of matters to be tride, How much vnwise accursed I, whom neyther reason led, Nor yet forcast could make auoyde the daungers may be bred, Nor counsel moue for to beware, Nor by experience past Aduise my selfe, but haue agreed in such a sodaine hast To fix my foolish fansie faste on such a doubtful wight. Who for his fault in natiue soyle, hath hyther made his flight, Or else, for wante of succour there, is glad to vse his payne. In forreyne partes, as toyling wretch to get his hyred gaine? Or witlesse wench, and couldst thou thus consent to exile slaue, And purchase payne vnto thy pay, bewitched dost thou raue? Suppose the infamy, the shame, the pouertie, the care, The fal, the losse of former fame, the ruinous misfare That were addicted to thy case if matcht to such a mate, Thou wert content to yeelde thy selfe to his abased state: And thinke how might thy kinred scorne thy will, and yelde thee blame, As also how thou shouldest deserue and reape reports defame. Might it not rightly bee replyde, thy fondnesse was thy fall? And would not thy abuse be scornde and mockt, yes certes of all. Why then, disdaine such foolishnesse, and set thy selfe at rest, Auoyde such shame, forecast thy cares and case, for this is best: And let such cause of thyne anoy be furthest from thy thought, Least stomacke woon, thou shouldest to late repent the thing were wrought. And then she pausde, and then agayne in new reuoluing minde, How much is scorneful tong (quoth shee) to scornefulnesse inclind? Why blame I so the seemeliest Knight that earthly globe contaynes? Or why presume I to reproch wyth tong which nought restraynes, But vomits al his venime out, Pesistratus, whose grace, Whose comely corps and seemely porte discries hys loyal race. Why name I hym an exyle slaue, whom gesture doth bewray For to proceede from princely lyne, and season doth display No slaue, but for his manhode tryde a worthy valiaunt Knight, As hath appearde by prowesse provde of late in open sight? And why a toyling wretch cal I, the noble youth with shame? Whose honored acts I may perceiue to yelde hym hauty fame. Unhappy tong, restraine such talke, thinke (hart) with happy ioy, If thou wert lovde as thou dost loue, would banish thy anoy: And such disgracing lay apart, suppose what seemely hew Pesistrate beares, his comely corpse and grace doth now renew: Whose feature passeth al the Gods, and wit Appollo staines, And whose especial planted giftes abound in natures vaynes: Thou knowest his gesture doth excel, his personage eke doth passe Eche wights, since taken life thou viewdst, or ere in Tarent was: And further, needes thou must confesse his manhoode to be rare: And is not this sufficient then, synce al these vertues are In him so plast, to moue thy minde, and stirre in fansies fyre Such zeale, as then to yelde thy selfe to him and his desire? Thinke how accordaunt in this yeares and fit in eche degree, Saue present welth in likely place, the wight doth seeme to thee: And wel pervsing thou mayst knowe that riches is the least, And vainest thing by due to bee accounted for the best: And whether wouldst thou be content, to spend thy lingring dayes. With crooked wretch, whose onely wealth and riches were his stayes, Or liue with seemely adorned wight. whose youthful yeares possesse Sufficient skil to yelde thee ease, and purchase wealthes increase? Whereon she stayde a whyle, and then in feeding fansie still, Why do I thus restrictly note with such a speciall wil, The worst of his estate? and why, suppose I of his want, Or thinke of ought he lacketh, since his vertues be not scant? No, no respect reiected cleane, I shall adioyne my hart And zelous loue to Pesistrate, for euer not to start: And whether hatred do assayle our state, or fortune frowne, Or scorne indeuor to suppresse our fame, and pul it downe, Or want prouoke vs for to beg, my hart shall stil consent, To fele what Pesistrate doth fele, and neuer shall repent: And though that fortune be our foe, yet shal report display, That faythful louers livde in linke and did in one decay. And therewithal as though in deede, their loues had bin supplyde, If euer (quoth she) Pesistrate, it otherwise be tryde, Than that I euer shal perfourme my fixed fayth to thee, The furies feare my tender flesh, and poyson be my fee. But when the pausing time in tract had set in plainer sight, Hir former fits, she pondring eke the lacke of hir delight, Bycause she was vncertaine of such certaine loue agayne From Pesistrate, as she did yelde, oh how she did complaine: Accursing both dame natures arte, who had employde hir eyes To worke throw sight such sodayne griefes, as eke with careful cryes So curst the time, that euer breath hir carkas had iclad, And season, wherby maintenance of lingring life was had: And then hir griefes increased so, and she was bound to payne, That hauing not sufficient strength hir dolours to restraine, Hir feeble limmes were forst to faint, and prostrate on the grounde The Lady laye, stil dumps were fled and vital course redound: And then renewde, like passion doth hir toused wits compel, For to recorde hir cause of cares, which to hir case befel: Wherin she further pondring, did peruse how folly lead Hir tickle wil wheron hir griefes was erst the more ybread? And thinking thus, as one prouokt, not able to withholde Such earnest motion, for hir ease with tong she did vnfolde Hys altered minde and changed dumps, which forst hir thus to say: None but my selfe vnhappy wretch is cause of my decay? For tis my folly that allures my griefes, bycause in vayne I hope, come therefore wished death, and ryd me of my payne. Alas if doubt should make beware the doubtful, wherfore then (O Catane) dost thou not doubt, whose doubt is dispayre cleane? Or why dost thou ascertayne so thy selfe to haue in holde Pesistrates hart, as he hath thine, what maketh thee so bolde? Thou knowst y? youth doth minde affaires that tende to purchase fame, And not such ioyes to thinke vpon, thou thrise and thrise to blame. Why then should not thy selfe the like indeuor set aside, Such folly cleane, as seemes by right thy rudenesse to deryde? And this so sayde, she did declyne to drousie couch, where as A thousand sobs and sighes aryse, and sundry thoughts do passe From greued carkas to the skyes, whom moning thus a whyle I leaue, and to Pesistratus I shal resigne my style. That woful wight, who like wise vext, (as erst was sayde) remaynes In midst of his aboundant griefes, wherein he stil complayns. And thus, the louers liue in lacke of that they most desire, And mutual both vncessant burne in Cupids paineful fire: Whom for a space the season moues my verse for to refraine, Til season such as season shal inforce my pen agayne To leaue the state of Kenedox and doings to discry, Wherto now season craues I should my present pen apply. That Kenedox was left as dead by Pesistrate 'tis sayde, And likewise how by hunting Knights he homewarde was conuayde, As also, how through this abuse his kinsmen movde to yre, Which came to visite him, in rage did backe againe retyre. Which variance bred to suche a strife within a little time, That spighting still the heynousnesse of Kenedoxus crime, And thinking on the present wante of Pesistrate hys ayde, (Whose presence was the cheefest staffe wheron their profit stayde:) The kinsmen sought to take awaye from Kenedox his right, And sundry times by force of armes assaulting it with might. In field appointed at the last the conquest they attainde, And forced Kenedox to flye, and slew them that remainde: Whereon the wretched Kenedox was forst to leaue the soyle For shame, that cowardly be fled, and purchast had the foyle And therefore after long aduise he minded to arriue, In Italy, where as he heard Pesistrate was aliue: Determining that if he could but once approch to sight Of Pesistrate, to thrust him through, and thence to take his flight. And thus supposing did prouide to do as he deuisde: And after his arriual at Tarentum, he surmysde, At first to execute the same, but in a further space, When he had wistlyer pervsde and thought vpon the case: And seene the danger that would ryse, if rashely he were bent To slay his brother in such wise, as was his first intent. He then determined to deforme himselfe, disfiguring cleane Eche part he might, supposing so as by a secrete meane, To be as seruaunt entertaynd of Pesistrate, whereby He might in secret worke the feate that he did meane to try. His beard he cut, and shavde his head, and vsed strange attyre, And after ech thing fit preparde, he boldly did aspyre To presence of Pesistratus, who solitarie was, With booke in hand, in garden set, the tedious time to passe: To whom the Kenedox with grace and gesture wel disposde, (His salutations friendly made) his meaning thus disclosde: Oh worthy Knight, thy raysed fame hath sounded to mine eares, The which hath movde me boldly thus, deuoyde of doubted teares, To craue thy curtesy to yelde such fauour vnto me, As that I might a happy man, be intertaind of thee: Whose seruice more I do esteeme than princes equal state, Or bondage better than the best of fortunes flattering fate. To whom (quoth Pesistrate) my friend. a stranger thou dost seeme Of modest meekenesse, wise conceyt, and gesture as I deeme: And for as much as I can iudge no otherwise of thee, But that should wel maintaine my hope I graunt and do agree To thy request, and what thy power can further for myne ease, To doe the same with willing hart, it shall my fansie please. This sayde Pesistratus, but least he did suspect the guile That lurked vnder flattring phrase and poysnous pleasant stile, Bycause that he perswaded was that Kenedox was slaine, As with his eyes he also saw his latest fatal payne: As likewise thought he that the man, had bene a Troyan borne, Bycause his beard and naked head was in such maner shorne: Wheron he made him priuy straight what things did appertayne Unto himselfe, and wherunto he should imploy his paine: And then demaunding of his name, that Antropos it hight The seruant sayde, which Pesistrate esteemed to be right. And thus the wicked wretch hath brought as erst he did require, Unto a perfect purposde end the ful of his desire: Whose further pranks to be declard hereafter shal insue, And now Cataneas ceaslesse cares my trauell shal renew: Who stinteth not, but euen as erst she spent hir lothed dayes, So stil the countenaunce of hir wealth vpon Pesistrate stayes. And lingring out the lazy time, when Tytans glittring face Forsaken had to shew him selfe, incroching couching place, And PhÅbo, did succeede in roome, and Sopor claymde his right, Catanea viewes in drousy dreame, as though in certayne sight Pesistrate sitting on a banke with pleasant flowers deckt: To whom a Serpent did approch, of Hydras feareful secte, With hundred heads and thousand tongs, which strake with such a force, Pesistratus, that it seuerde his head from deadly corps: Which so dismaide the drousy dame, that hauing not such poure As to perceiue it for a dreame. she lay in traunce an houre, Before that vitall course could be recouered to his place, Or sense had sense to vnderstande the sondnesse of the case? And when reuyued from hir sound she was, for very feare Eche limme did quake and tremble, such hir grieuous dolors were: Bewayling wofully hir fates, that fortune was inclinde, For to increase such double cares to ouerpresse hir minde: Til Titan had from East appeard, and raysde him selfe againe, And then the Lady rose from couch and ceased to complayne. And gan aduisedly to thinke that dreames were but abuse, Wheron to better ease approcht, she doth disdain to muse Thereon, but calles Pesistratus to minde, and doth renue How that the wight, as abiect wretch was clad in taunie hue, Which doth pretend, that he did loue, and could not that attayne, That should intend his loyal faith for to requite againe: And thus supposing of the thing, which as a pleasant bait Did feede hir fansie and incroche vppon hir humor strayght Oh seemely wight Pesistratus, thryse happy is the dame (Quoth she) whom thou so lov'st, as for hir sake thou wearst the same: Hir ioyes surmount vnto the heauens, hyr comforts pierce the skyes: Or else I deeme the blynded wretch dame natures gifts defies: Would to the Gods, it were my selfe to whom thou dost employ Thy hart, then happy might I thinke that greater were my ioy Than Alexanders hye renowne, or Dame Mineruas fame. Alas replyde she then, what more vnlikelier than the same? Unlikely why? I know my state and welth as great as his: But doth Cupido wealth respect or loke where riches is? No, no, alas, what motion then prouokes thee to such hope? Thou knowst that loue at randon runs, and Cupid shoots at scope, Oh truth (she sayde) and then, as though a woman prest to dye, Smal hope I haue yet some, bycause his gestures did discry Of late his minde with paled face and countenaunce sodaine changde, When as I viewd his bloud discourst and al his humors rangde. And thus hir fansie with hir selfe did question, til at last, Dispayre not Catane (she sayde) nor be no more agast: But since thou seest, thy louer is in taunie colours drest. Weare thou the like, that he may iudge the cause of thine vnrest. Wherto agreed, shee did proceede to execute hir wil: Whom thus I leaue and shal resigne to Pesistrate my quil: Who stil consumes the tedious time in teares and ceaslesse woes, And dare not once (vnhappy man) his cause of cares disclose To any wight, but to himselfe in secret doth complayne, Wherby the more he doth prouoke his motions vnto payne, Til that in curssed time, by chaunce as he bewayling was. His new come seruant Antropos, by chamber dore did pas: And hearing thus his maister mone, did (entring there) espye The seely man on tossed bed as redy bent to dye: To whom the caytife Kenedox, intending nought but guyle, With hauty phrase and hidden glose adorned thus his stile: Alas my Lord, from what disease proceedeth this thy care? What is the vexing cursed cause that greeued thus you are? Hath losse of goods distempered, or faithful friends thy state? Or hath impoisned fortune fround and spyghted thee of late? Or hath the seemely sight of Dame disquieted thy hed, Wherby thy fixed fansie is by blinded Cupid led? Informe thy seruant of thy cause of cares, and if his powre May do thee good, 'tis ready prest: and if that fortune loure, Forbeare the same with patience, and season shall requite In time agayne, when fortune leaues to profer further spyte: And if that loue assayle thy youth, attende what I shal say, And scorne not counsel, neyther let aduise be set away: For ofte it hath bene seene, the blynd in safety sure to passe The place wheras the seing man hath falne and burst his face. And sometime may a wise man bee aduised by a foole, As doth a whetstone serue to sharpe, but is no caruing toole. If loue I say, so trouble thee, my louing Lord beware, Least nusling, thou thy selfe be trapte in loues intangling snare: And may, that if thou loue, thy loue with equal loue be plast, For hye ascendyng gettes a fall, and weaknesse is defast: And since occasion forceth thee to faynte through chaunced fate, Comfort thy heauy hart, and eke support thy drousy pate With hope, and season shal display the proofe of hope in time, When feareful fansie shall be fled, though not in present pryme. For how might euer sugrie sappe be knowne, if bitter tast Had nere bene felt, or pleasant baite were nere addicte to wast? How wealth, if neuer woes were wist? how health if neuer harme? Or what man can descerne the colde which neuer knew the warme? Giue therefore place to paine, and that shall pleasure bring at last, As diuers sauours teach, the true experience of a taste: And hope as I do hope, which is, to see the happy day, That thou shalt ful enioye thy wishe, thy sorrowes worne away: And leaue thy couch, and seeke the means cleane to auoyde thy care, For lying thus, thou dost encrease thy dolorous misfare. And worthie Pesistratus, marke and ponder wel my words: A man with payne may beate the bush, and other catch the birds. So mayst thou thus encrease thy griefs, decreasing stil thy strength And lustie force, when other men shall get thy game at length. Were this the way to winne thy wyl? were this the wisest acte That thou mayst do, so to abuse thy wittes by foolish fact? No, no, thy wealth wil wear away, thy force wil fainte and fayle, Thy sorrowes wil augment defame, and nothing thee auayle: Ryse therefore vp, with courage arms and fortify thy case, Polish thy parts with healthful hope, auoyde this lothsome place, And eyther seeke such means thy selfe, as may exyle thy griefe, Or else let seruant vse his paine to purchase thy reliefe, Who shal, by death and life (I vow) for thy desired ease, Both venter life, and suffer death, and present life displease. That all, Pesistrate noted wel, and pondred in his harte An answere, viewing in his deed what were his wisest part: And in coniecturing, thought at first to holde his secret deepe, Considering that the Fox doth winck when oft he faynes to sleepe: But afterward respecting much, the earnestnesse did seeme To be in talke of Antropos, bycause he could not deeme No otherwise than meere good wyl to moue his zelous phrase, And marking that his counsel was as needeful to his wayes, Without suspect, alas: the Knight his secrets did disclose In ende to Antropos, and thus his woful speech arose: What sodayne tickle chaunce hath charmd thy footsteppes to the place, To see thy friend tormented thus, and vext before thy face: Whom euery creature doth disdaine, and comfort doth refuse, And euery tormente, with his payne and penurie doth vse? 'Tis neither want of worldly wealth, nor lacke of earthly store, Nor losse of friendes nor frowning face of fortunes fickle lore. That makes me spende my doleful dayes in such excesse of teares, But Antropos, alas, alas, it is thy trembling feare. The doubtfull hope, the cold conceits, the ceaslesse burning broyles Of louers fits, that I sustayne, and thus my stomacke toyles, And stil alas I strayne, as much as in my powre doth lye, Yet aye, the more I striue, the more I feele my force to dye, And thus I liue in deepe dispayre, and haue no cause to ioy, But drinke my death, and feede of ayre, and breede mine owne anoy, Wheron I can not thinke my payne his pleasure wil induce, Bycause no pleasure can depend vppon mine owne abuse. Agayn, my hope is so defast, and I my selfe attaine Unto such little cause of hope, that hope is most my paine. And though al this I knowe, yet griefe so much doth me suppresse, That I not able am to seeke or worke for my redresse, Thus seest thou Antropos, so much vnhappy is my state, That thy aduise is frustrate all, and councel come to late. Wherfore as cause doth moue my cryes, so forst I do complayne, And haue no cause to set me free or these my greefes restrayne Yet for as much as I perceiue what wisdome is in thee, And how thou tenderly bewaylst my case, and fauorest mee, (O Antropos) I shal declare to thee my secretes all, And how by due desert, I haue attaind to this my fal. In Appollonia, Grecian Soyle, a towne of raised fame I borne a worthy father had, Aganetos his name, Who tendring so his louing sonnes as much as father might, Wherof I one, an other was, who Kenedoxus hight: And when that crooked age encrocht vpon our auncient Sire, The father did with trickling teares of vs his sonnes require, Like valiants to withstand the rage of Tetimetians pride, (Who were our foes) as he before their hautie hartes had tryde, Disposing vnto Kenedox his landes, as due by right They were: and vnto me, what so of foes we got by fight: And stinting so the aged Sire from seat to earth declynde, And taking death, vnto the heauens his spirits he resinde. Whom in due time we layde in earth, and then did both consente, To worke for foes despight, wherto our mutual wils were bent: And in a space as we requirde, we met our foes in face: And in the skirmish ouercame their pride in pointed place, And slew eche man, saue those which fled, wherby when so the soyle They purchasde had, by right I claymde their landes, in forsayde soyle Containd, bycause by fathers wil they were disposde to mee. But to this same, my brother would in no wise once agree, Wherat our kinsmen were displeasd with Kenedox, and sayde, That since it was my right, the same should be to me conuayd: But he as much displeasde agayne, and fretting in his yre, Departed thence in wrath, bycause he myst of his desire: Whom viewing I, so fiercely set, supposing to perswade, Did follow fast, but when I seene of him, with deadly blade He meeting, thought me to haue slaine in that his hasty mode, Whose rigor viewd, with Rapier drawne in hande, I him withstoode: And movde by this occasion iust to anger, caitife vile (Quod I) wouldst thou in brothers bloude so cowardly defile Thy filthy fists? an?d? art thou ment to seeke thy friends decay? If so, in a conuenient place and on appointed day Agree to get reuenge, and seeke thy quarel to renue, And I this blade in traytorous bloud of thine shal there imbrue: To [illeg.] agreede, he vowed by Saints to meete: and time approcht, Wherein eche foe his brothers corps with bloudy blade incrocht, In further fight I slue the knight, whereon in hast I fled, And towards these Italian parts, through seas in ship was led. And when arivde I was, such fate allotted to my pay, That wandring vp and downe, not known, and knowing not the way, By chance I met an ancient sire, with countnance verye graue, And sobre gesture, vnto whom intelligence I gaue Of my affaires, and whilst that such discourse of talke did passe, In forest by, Pecipater with other hunting was A monstrous Lion, whom so long the coursers chased had, That flinging Lion forrest left, came towards vs as mad, With whom incountring I bestowd such blowes, as at the last, His rage abated, him I slue, and so the daunger past. And by this meanes acquainted grew with chasers Knightly rout, But chiefly with Pecipater, with whome, as it fel out, I did repaire to present place, which place hath wrought my paine, And feedes my fansie, as thou seest, with poisnous pleasant baine: For Pecipater worthy man a sister hath, who hight: Catanea, a Phenix rare, a peerelesse dame by right, Whose seldome beauty hath dismaid so much my wandring wits, That wil I nil I, forst I am to suffer these my fits, Accursing the vnhappy time, that ere my footesteps trode Italian ground, or that my life so long hath heere abode: As eke the time that ere I vieud that glittring face of hirs, Whose beauties blase, I dare auow doth dimme the twinckling starres. Thus haue I tolde thee (Antropos) the cause of my anoy, My present state, and vexing griefs, and ouerpassed ioye: Which al these paines, I do confesse, of this the present time, I do deserue, and thousands more for former forsayd cryme: And thee and none else haue I made so priuie to the same, My secrets wherefore keepe thou close, and yeld me no more blame. And so he stint to speake and teares did trickle downe the face Of silly man and quaking feare distemperd euery place So much that wretched wight he stode in such amazed muse, As though his sprites were fully bent his body to refuse. Whom Antropos beholding, thus did craftely reply, With tong dessembling vnder which the mischeefe al did lie: My Lord alas, I much lament to see thy doleful dayes In irksome cares so vainly spent, whilst hauty fame and praise Might be thy gain, through knighthod shown, refuse this lothsome trade Of lazie life, in lingring woes and let thy sorowes vade. For since it is but loue, that moues thy stomacke to such paine, No doubt we shal preuent the harmes, and wel inough restraine The further mischeefe that would grow throught want of wise forcast, By trauel such as shal intend to worke thy welth at last: Thou knowst that nothing is so darke, but labour doth espie, And nought so stout, but trauel may suppresse, if it wil trie: And wherefore then wilt thou dispayre? or why doth drousie doubt So drowne thy senses, that thou thus forsakst the courtly rout, And yeeldst thy carkasse to thy couch, as one who seekest to craue His lazie case, or to be layd in his desired graue? Is this the way to moue the mindes of Ladies to surmise Uppon thy manhood, or the meanes to make thy fixed eyes Of lowly stomacks to respect thy person? or the way To yeeld thee fame through due deserts, or purchase louers pray? No no, thou knowst: then shame to vse such meanes as do allure Thy present hindrance in such things as faine thou wouldst procure. And now forsake thy drousie bed, and vse such fit attire, As seemeth requisite and apt for louing, thy desire: For Catane in taunie hue is clad of late and why? Maist thou not iudge it doth as well like loue of hers discry As of thine owne? renue thy hart and let not courage quaile, Hope wel and haue wel, so they say, nought haue, if nought assayle: And write thy minde with plaintife pen vnto thy Ladies grace, Beseeching comfort for thy cares, and fauor for thy case: And I thy secret seruant, shal in secret al conuay Unto hir hands, this is the best, this is the wisest way. For otherwise thou ceaslesse maist continue in thy griefe, And stil bewaile, and yet be voyde of comfort or reliefe. Thou wisely sayst (quod Pesistrate) and I with willing hart, To follow this thy good aduise wil prosecute my part: Though yet, alas, I may perceiue that al is but in vaine, Bycause presumption plainly shewes presumption of disdaine? As also if I should faile, what mischeefe would succeede, And what rebuke vnto my shame would follow for my deed? Yet trye I wil, for sure I am my Lady wil not proue, Though hirs surpassed my good wil or flamd in hotter loue. And therwithall the trembling wight, on crouching knees declinde, With lifted handes vnto the skies his prayers thus resinde. Oh mighty Ioue, with heauenly ghost my spirits now indue, Giue vttering gift, that sugred pen may so my griefes renue, As that my faithful meanings may requited be againe With some remorse of loyal loue: and so he stint to straine Hys further speeche: and then with pen pouided in his hand, Thus did the wretch discribe his case subdude to beauties band. Pesistratus letter to his Ladie. Avvoful wight whose curelesse cares compel him to complaine, VVhose fansie fixed fast, [illeg.] fed vppon Cupidos baine, VVhose doubtful dumps of deepe dispaire, haue dround in dul anoy His heauy hart, and can attaine to no desired ioy, Hath boldly made assault, to saue (if fortune do consent, And fauor from your tender brest in gentle wise be bent) The life which erst depend on death, and panted in the paines Of latest fits, and now through hope some sappie sense sustayns. If faithfull Troylus had a cause with teares for to bewayle His fates, when first Cupidos cares his stomacke did assayle, Or Tantalus the wretched wight his dolours to disclose, Or else the furies to declare their pangs they may suppose I Pesistratus motion haue to vtter forth my smart, VVhose grifes excede eche other paine that euer pincht the hart: And (oh Catanea) all these things I suffer for thy sake, VVhose fauour doubting I should finde, doth cause eche limme to quake: Let therfore pitie yelde his power from tender louing brest, In speedy hast to cure my cares, and yelde thy louer rest. VVhich if thy grace do graunt to giue, my stomacke shal intend, A faithful louer for to liue til life doth take his ende: But if I faile of that I would, then thrise accursed, I Haue no refuge, but glad to yelde my lothed limmes to dye. And thus, my simple sute disclosde, and pity cravde, I leaue Your grace, and to the hiest heauens your person I bequeaue. This was the summe of the complaint, which with his proper fist, That worthy Pesistratus wrote, who could not cares resist: But after this his finisht worke, His woes renewd againe, And he (as erst, so likewise nowe) Both [illeg.]mble in his paine, Supposing what defame would fall, If that is case not mornde, His earnest sute, and such requests of Ladies grace were scornde. And thereupon, in deepe dispaire the wretch would thus haue rente The paper streight, wherin but earst his trauel he had spent, Had it not bin for Antropos, whose guileful words allurde, That hope renewd, to Pesistrate his fansie he procurde To graunt againe in hope of grace the same to be conuayde By Antropos, as was deuisde: wheron he then thus sayde: Amidste dispayre a little hope informing fansies feares Of happy fauour, I haue dewde the paper with my teares, And deckt it in the careful robes of louers cursed case, Sustaynde by sighs, and fed by sobbes, I liue through hope of grace. Thus say, the woful wight hath sayde, and let not to declare, How stil I lye, and yet I liue, and what my dolours are. And so he ceast to speake, and gulfes of griesly gripes arose, That feeble man, was faynting, forst his senses strength to lose, Til time againe resigned had due sappe to vital vains: Wherin Pesistrate left, amidst his cares and pinching payns, His seruant Antropos aryues to long desired place, Where Catane remaynd, and spyes hir happy wished face: To whom approched, greeting well, the seruant did prepare, With filed tong to Lady thus his message to declare: The most [illeg.] woful wretch who Pesistratus hight, Hath wyld my trauel to present these letters to your sight, Beseeching humbly, that your grace with pity would respect His cursed case, the which with cares is wofully bedeckt: And he amazde, as though of wittes distraught with fansies filld, So frounst in midst of Cupides flames which hath his hart distillde, Like sauorie sappe of fruitfull herbe which meltes in vessel where The fuming fire doth force the same a watrie substance beare, That neyther health, ne wealth, ne rest, the seelye soule sustaynes, But only freezeth in his fears, and burneth in his pains. Which sayd, the curteous Lady did to Antropos replye, That letters red, to morrow nexte, hir answere should discry Hir meanings, wishing Pesistrate no otherwyse to deeme, But that hir friendship should incline his proffers to esteeme: For which a thousand thanks returnd, the seruant doth retire, And telles his Maister, al fell out according to desire: And how the dame with willing hart receyvde the letters sent, And that with profferd seruice she was very well content, With promise made, that answere should tomorrow make requite Of his good wil, as should intende to moue him to delight: Which Pesistratus hearing, was the ioyfulst man aliue, So motiond to such sodaine ioyes, as penne can not descriue The liuely fansies that he felte, nor yet the hart suppose His happie state, nor his conceits no trouling tong disclose: But as a mortal, cleane renewde from earthly irksome cares To heauenly ioyes, so Pesistrate (thrise happy man) he fares. Wherfore he blist the fruitful wombe from whence he did proceed, And eke the pappes that gaue him sucke, and sustnance that did feede His nourisht limmes, and eke the day wheron he tooke his flight From natiue soyle, Dame Nature eke who yelded him his sight, With all the furtherers of life: but most be blist the Dame, Who was the cause, that happie be was movde to blisse the same: And then: you furies al (quoth hee) receiue your due agayne, I haue no cause to wayle with you, I scorne your drousie payne. You pleasant Nymphes, come you and ayde the blest to paynt his ioyes, And let the cursed caytifs playne, bewayling their anoyes. But pausing then a whyle: when time had somewhat made delay Of sodaine such conceyued ioyes, he then began to say: Oh cursed caytife, what abuse hath blinded wandring wittes? What cause hath movde thee so to vse such vnaduised fits? Hast thou receiude of Ladies grace in writing hir good wil, So blasde as nothing can disproue the same? No, no: distil Then from the watrish eyes thy teares, let sighes go flye apase, To maintaine that which thou hast wrote, according to thy case: And rather yeelde thee to thy couche, as erste, for to bewayle: For likelyhoodes vncertayne bee, and fickle hope wil fayle: And those thy letters so receiude, the Lady doth retayne, To shew thy fondnesse for a scoffe, for sure shee doeth disdaine Thy simple seruice, and doth scorne thy bolde presumptuous sute, And means to yelde for thy defame the same to common brute: Wherby the pryde should be espyde and lewdnesse should be blowne Through euery eare, that thy abuse of eche man might be knowne. And dost thou then conceiue a cause as though of luckie happe, When so thy fondnesse is displayde in euery taunters lappe? Oh blinded foole, dispatch thy life more rather with thy blade, And let in brest with percing knife thy latest wound be made, And there wythall to that intente he ready was to drawe For his dispatch: but pondring then agayne when well he sawe His vaine peruse, reuoking sense from errours further thral, Do wretch (quoth he) and wouldst thou so obtayne thy proper fall? Dost thou not know the Lady is of gentle curteous kinde, Of wise behauiour, and discrete, and of a lowly minde? And dost thou then suppose that she would worke thee such defame? No, no, in iudging so thou art vnhappy much to blame. And much vnworthy to receiue the thing thou dost require, Since to thy Ladie such abuse thy stomacke doth aspire: Ist not inough for riddance of thy tedious irksome greefe, Of Ladies mouth, that Ladies grace shall soone be thy releefe? And canst thou not a season stay to take thy wished ioye, When thou hast spent long tract of time in case of much anoy? Let reason rule thy sense for shame, and bridle wandring wil, And shun such foolish forcing cause as doth prouoke thyne ill. Thus sayde Pesistratus, and then at somewhat better ease, His happe bequeathed vnto hope, his dolours do appease: And fed by hope and yet in doubt and sundry sodaine feares, In wandring motions voyde of stay the lingring time he weares: Whom I resigne in such his fits and shal intende to paint, As simple vttrance can declare, the ioyes that did attaint The beautiful Catanea, who after message doon Of Antropos, to secret place approching, (dolors woon) Did so record hir happy haps, that pen may not expresse The force of those hir ioyful fits, which did hir heart addresse To happy state, as woman erst to euery dolor yokt, And now with peerelesse ioyes possest, to gladfull cheere prouokt, Whose luckie fates so frounsed had hir senses in delight, That trickle teares, for happy ioye, distild: and yet no sight She had of secrets that should bee in letters there reposde, But kist the same a thousand times before it was disclosde: And then with daintie finger, she attempted to reueale The same, but first with sugry lips she kist again the seale, And then with gasing greedy sight the letters did pervse A hundred times before she could agree for to refuse The same, hir comforts so arose through forsayd letters sent, That she not able was, from them hir fansie to relent. For season long til senses were so much therein itost, The humor fed his fill, the dame for ioy began to bost (With happy wights) hir happy state, whose comforts did excell (As she supposde) eche life, whereto no comfort did rebel. Wheron the Lady forst hir ioyes surpassing to compare, The Phenix gan hir happy fates and case for to declare With hauty voice, and thus she sayde: oh fortunatest day That euer past in earthly globe, oh sweetest purchast pray That euer louer hath attaind: whose haps excel my ioyes? Whose riddance is more better made than mine from my anoyes? Who liues in happier plight than I? who spends the lucky tide, In better blisse? whose case is more than mine by cares defide? Whom fauors fortune more than me? whom hath she more aduaunst? Whose loyal loue is more than mine by loyal loue inhaunst? Whose louers seemelynesse doth passe my comely louing Knights? No, no, none cause like me to ioye, none liues in more delights. Most happy therfore be the tide that ere I saw the face Of Pesistrate that peerelesse wight, and viewde his portly grace? And blessed be his gentle hart, whose loyal loue hath brought Unto my state more ease, than all the Gods could haue ywrought, Thus sayde the dame, and pausing then againe, vnhappy wretch Quod she, what meanest thou (by this) thy slender throte to stretch In such disguised sort? what toyes assaulted haue thy hed? That want of reason al thys whyle thy wandring wits hath led? What though Pesistratus hath made so fayned a complaynt? Is this sufficient to allure that fauour should attaint Thy stomacke straight? oh Catane dost thou not know the guile Of mens abuse? and dost thou not perceiue this suttle wile: And art thou yet to learne their trade? is practise out of vse? Or dost thou deeme, that now disdaine doth scorne the like abuse? No, no, their faind deceits abound, theyr snares be dayly layde, And al their trauell and their speeche to trapping trade conuaid. And yet, when yeelded loue is lent vnto their faind request, They seeme to skorne this is their vse, to make therof a iest. And thus by nature they addict, minde nought but womens shame, And midst the rest of scoffing routs they most deride the same. For offred they do much detest, and coyed grace they craue, Which when by long complaints and sutes in end they purchast haue, They do reiect, as not content therwith, or else disdaine To vse their loue so stately bent as nature would maintaine. And though by chaunce they now and then do make a matched mate Unto themselues, of Lady such as doth adorne their state, When tract of time hath made delay of their inflamed fits, Then Tigers like, they do surmise and settle spitefull wits, To make a thralled slaue of hir whom erst they did retaine As for their mate, this is their guise to worke their louers paine: And thus they eyther alwayes fayne to purpose our reproch, By scoffed folly: or disdaine the loue they did incroche: Or else reiect the dame, which erst he sude, through hautie pride, As who should say, so trim a man was he, as not denide: Or else attained to their wish, they make their Ladies thral Unto their fickle wils: and thus our folly frames our fall. Should therfore I, whose hautie fate doth stand at certaine ease, So much my noble birth abase, and present welth displease, And purchase shame and leese renowne, as so to put in yoke To needy slaue, my pressed necke, whose vsage may prouoke My noble hart to seruile state, and presse my honor downe, Wherby my dueties al decay, and leesing my renowne, I should be scoffe to euery tong and as a common blame To euery taunter? no, I scorne the cause of such defame: And rather than I would agree to such abused thought, My fatal webbe of sisters three againe shal be vnwrought. Thus earnest was the Lady then against hir former minde, Yet pausing now a while, the dame was contrary declinde: And thinking how she rashly vowd against hir former will, Which likewise was with solemne othe confirmd, the teares did tril From trickling eyes, as drops of deaw descending to the ground, And she dismaid, as though addrest to deadly dampish swound. From heauy hart with doleful cheere renewd for to complaine, And to hir former rash conceits replyed thus againe: Oh faithlesse wench, dost thou deserue a loyal louers hart For to inioy? who wauering thus art blowne to euery parte. Or deemst thou it as possible, such currishnesse to finde In Pesistrate, whose outward shape declares his curteous kinde? Or dost thou thinke that eche is bent to worke his louers thrall, Bycause that some men take delight to purchase others fall? No, no, thy leudnesse is deceyvde, thrise cursed thou art movde To speake in mens behalfe, since so of man thou art beloude, And not so gratelesse to requite thy loue with such disdaine, Which doth pretend, that womankind is rather bent to fame: Shame such abuse, and settle once thy wits at certainetesse, And now prouide to aunswere that Pesistratus request, With such a constant louing hart as he doth seeme to beare, Who spendes the tedious time through hope of grace in painful feare. And leauing then, with further speach the time for to delay, She gan deuise such meeke conceit as playnly myght conuay Hir louing hart to Pesistrate, wheron with happy quill In happy time, the Lady thus did write hir constant wil. The letter of Catanea to hir Louer. Thy louing letters Pesistrate, thou seemely wight attainde Vnto my sight, thy Lady hath with happy hand restrainde: And wishing to thy person wealth and cause of ceaslesse ioyes, Hir heauy hart hath much bewailde thy former long annoyes, At present time, with yelded loue requiting gentle grace, Of thine aboundant, with as much as may supply thy case. And though thy pangs surpast the pains that lurke in Plutos lake, Thou neuer suffredst halfe like griefes or passions for my sake, As I for thy misdoubted loue haue suffred deadly smart, VVhose least vexation able was to teare the strongest hart. And though thy loue as loyall bee, as Troylus faith in Troy, Or else as earnest as it raines in brest of blynded boy, I dare auow my fyred hart in equal liue to flame, VVhich fixed fast vnto my faith, thou only reapst the same, And onely shalt whylst lingring life doth vitall course maintaine, Or else damnation be my due, and Plutos forge my gaine. Thus to thy wish I do aspire, and graunt thy whole request, And to performe eche cravde desire of thine, mine hart is prests And therfore briefly to conceiue as I haue briefly wrote, That neither tract of time, nor paine, shall make thee once forgote, But aye for to be shrinde in brest, and borne in constant minde, VVhilst carkas left, vnto the skies my spirits be resynd: And for bycause I long to view thy comelie curteous face, I haue deuisde, that wide of eche suspect, in secret place Thou mightst repaire, where mutuall harts moy ioy their happie owne: The time appointed, and the place is to thy seruant showne. Thy only owne, whilst life doth last, til breath be gone, til sense be past. This when the Lady finisht had, reuovlde in mazed muse, Why rather did I not (quoth she) at first seeme to refuse Hys proffred seruice, and to coy to make the matter strange, Wherby I might prouoke his loue more hotter for to range: Than thus to shew thy selfe so bound vnto the wight againe, Declaring for his wished loue my former forcing paine? Wherto she pausing did reply, that faithful harts should frame Eche thing so faithfull, as it should deserue no ioy of blame. And so content, with softned waxe the letters she doth seale, And kissed them: to secrete brest of hirs, she doth repose The same, whilst seruant were approcht at due appointed tyde, Who present come to that intent, and of the Lady spyde, Receyvde the letters, with aduise of foresayde time and place, Whereas both met, the louer might determine ful, the case: And with a thousand greetings sent vnto the worthy wight, The seruant homewards did repayre apace, and meets the Knight, To whom he yeeldes the paper sent, as also doth discry, The pointed place and present tide wherto he should apply His iorney made, but oh the ioyes the happy man conceivde. When these thus luckie newes he had and letters were bequeavde, I deeme the Gods had no such cause or motions to be glad, As in that ten times blessed time the ioyful man he had. It were therefore but frustrate, that I further should pretende His happy haps for to discribe, or fansies to extende, Since heauenly powers can scarse comprise, I deeme, the wondrous ioyes, That fed his fansie with delightes of sundry pleasaunt toyes, Wherein he spent the altered time, till Titan had resinde Hymselfe to west, and left the clokes of pitchy clouds behind, And then againe recoursed was, and had his streames displayde In open East, on fertile earth, and gladful light conuayde, Wherin the Louers lothsome couch forsaken, do prepare To meete in happy pointed place, and gorgeously they are In silken robes of costly price arayde and redy prest, As louers such as for the nonce their seemely sightes addrest, And after iourney, are aryvde to foresayde ioyful place, Whereas the Knight his Lady met, doth kisse and then imbrace. Whom likewise she a hundred times rekist and kist againe, And he requited euery one by one, yet toke no paine. That who had seene the seemely sight of louers there so blazde With comely corps and princely port, he wondring would (amazde) Have musde, that nature could haue made such artificiall show, Or that such imps of heauenly hewe from earthly globe should grow. And thus the louers ruld the time to their desired ioye, And made discourse of al their haps, and blist, that banisht ioye, They had attaynde to happy wish: til seasons tickle trade Approchte, of force (against their wils) departure must be made. Wherein, with parting kysse they past, appointing time renewde, When there in present place againe eche other might be viewde: And at departure, fixed fast their eyes for to beholde Eche others presence wistly markte, so vttrance did vnfolde Of louely vse, eche louing hart as long as time would lette, Uppon eche others comely corps their eyesights to bee sette. And thus departed, both yclad in like adorned hewes, They spend the time at wished ease, as stil the time renewes, And often thus they vsde to meete, and long their ioyes retainde, Til at the last, oh cursed case, their customes were restraynde By villayne seruant Antropos, whose long disguised guyle Hath now at last attempted, wrought the louers ioyes exile. Come come, Alecto therefore, thou vnhappy caytyfe, teache My drousie verse, the diuelishe wyles of this vnhappy wretch, Whose rankrous hart deuising long to worke Pesistrats payne, Had now a little conuenient time to charme his poysnous baine. For when the villayne had supposde what snare he might inuent, Thus bring priuy to the chiefe of all their whole intente, And pondring what displeasure might to Pesistrate aryse. If that his secrete loue were knowne, the miser did deuise How to disclose to vncle of Catanea the same, With further forged tale, that might ingender greater blame. Wheron approcht to Phetratus hir vncle, so he hight, With tale prepared for the nonce, thus vttred he his spight: Sir Phetratus, the earnest zeale I beare to thy estate, And eke the length of long successe I wish vnto thy fate, Hath made me boldly to presume, my trauell to addresse, As for a wacking vnto thee: least treason should suppresse Thy quiet wealth; and vnderstand, that Pesistrate is bente, Conspired with Catanea, who yeelded hath consent, Ere it be long to seeke thy death and reue thy vital life, Eyther by pampered poyson, or by secret bloudy knyfe. For as by chaunce I musing sate alone in secrete place, I herde these two, presuming thus vpon the traytrous case, And Pesistratus (holding in his armes Catanea) say, I would not haue this toy my loue no whit at al, dismay Thy doubtful head, for nought I care for Phetratus consent, But haue deuised wel inough, the mischiefs to preuent That he may worke, to let our loue: from hence not far remayns, A Grecian seely man, who liues in ceaslesse extreeme payns Through sicknesse, whiche hath long supprest his wished health, and hee Of late for hyre of certayne summe, did willingly agree For to begin in poysned cup to Phetratus, whereby Both he himselfe and Phetratus, through poyson dronke should dye: The seely man to gaine of golde so vehemently desires, To leaue vnto his simple sonne, and gladly he aspires To dye, bycause his paines extreeme so vext the weried wight, That voyde of health he can attaine to rest ne day ne night. And by this meanes, our greatest foe shal soone dispatched be, And we attayne to happy day the which we long to see. This sayde Pesistrate, and I heard Catanea replie, That it was politikely thought, aduising him to try The subtil feate in present space, and not for to delay But do it in as speedy hast as possible he may. This with mine eares I heard sir knight, and wil auow the same Upon my body to the death vnto the traitors shame: And that you may for certaine know my former talke as true, I heard the Louers point the place and time for to renue Their traytrous will: vnto which place if you with armed rout Proceede, there may you cleane dissolue the causes of your dout. And apprehend the traytors both at ease, deuoyde of feare, Where you should do but to desert if that with poynt of speare You pearsed Pesistratus sides. Thus had the caytife told His forged tale, and now a space doth tatling tong with-hold, To heare what Phetratus woulde say, whose answere thus was made: Oh grisly griping gulfes of griefe, that stomacke do inuade: Is exile slaue Pesistratus so cowardly disposde To worke my death, before he dare to haue his grutch disclosde? And is Catanea so bente to seeke hir vnckles spoyle, Whose long regarde hath had respect to hir suspected foile? And hath she chosen for hir mate a slaue, whose like abuse As this, hath causde the wandring wight hys countrey to refuse? Wel, wel, for Pesistratus grutch and Catanes dispite, By saintes I vow, with present death I shall them both requite: And since the lawes of this our soile be thus, that who so layes To others charge conspiracie, must answer those assayes (Bycause he wanteth witnesse) first with solemne othe to sweare, That witnesse to be sincere, iust and true, that he doth beare: And then to bow no further grutch or spite, to cause the same, But only for his conscience sake, deuoyd of euery blame: And last, that he confirme the proofe therof, with manhode tride In courtly combate, him against of whom it is denide: I doe aduise thee Antropos, the trial to withstand With manly courage and my selfe shal ready prest at hand Giue aid to thee, if succoure neede, and all the slaues defie In thy behalfe, wherein by Saints I meane to liue and die. And I intend as thou hast sayde, the louers for to meete In pointed place, whose curtesie I shall so friendly greete, As both of them to lode with chaines til Proclamation made Of their conspiracie, thou shalt approue with manly blade, (Gainst who so one, that doth approch) thy sayings to be true: Wherein I hope the wished death of Traytours we shall view. This sayd, lefte Phetratus to speake, whom Antropos a space Forsoke, till season did require that vnto pointed place They should aspire, for to beholde the louers: but the cares Of Phetratus, and woes to tel, and how he doleful fares Through his conceiued griefes, it doth I deeme eche wit surpasse, The grieuous dolors of his harte, so passing painful was, To thinke that Catane should seeke his death, whose cheefest paine Was alwayes bent from tender age the Lady to restraine For eche mishap: and thus the wight, complained, til such time As ranckours rage disswaded had the man to muse of cryme, And now to presuppose reuenge, the which he did deuise. But midst of all these tossed thoughts, it could not once aryse To him, that tale of Antropos, should fainde or forged be, But stil his fansie he informde, that he should shortly see The proofe of al for to be true, as Antropos had sayde: And thus the wilfull wretched wight remayned so dismayde, Till time againe that Antropos returnde, who present is At season such, wherin they should if that they would, not nis Of louers sight, straight hye in hast with euery thing addrest Therto, whereon the wights prouide to haue ech purpose prest, And then they marcht in secret sort, and at the last drew nye Unto the place, where Louers were, whom there they might discry, Inioying so their presence, as the vse of Louers secte Doth take delight in likely case, but nought they did suspect (Alas) the mischiefe that did lurke, whereon deuoyde of feare, They stil imbrast and sweetly kyst in lurkers presence there. Who cursed wretches, at the last in rigour rushed out, And toke the Louers al agaste, suspecting no such dout. And bound as traitours them they led as Antropos deuisde, To presence of Pecipater, who at the first surmisde Some spited grutch, and fainde abuse, whereon with frowning face, How dare you villains all (quoth he) in such disguised grace, Conduct my sister to my sight? what haynous fault is done? To whom Sir Phetratus replyde what treason was begon, And how that Antropos discryde the same, who was content Uppon his body to approue gainst who (that durst) was bent For to deny the truth therof, (that) Pesistrate had sought With Catane, hir vncles death in secret to haue wrought) Which when Pecipater had heard, considering what their vse And custome was: he would not seeme to moue no more abuse, Bycause that iustice should take place, and least his partial wil Should cause the people to suspecte, some further cause of yl. By teares distilling from his brest, and sighes from heauy hart Proceeding fast, the woful man from thence doth streight depart To secret chamber, where his griefs so plenteously abound, That seely man in desprate minde, he tumbles on the ground, As though distraught of wittes, his payne ingendred such his smart: And he supposing of these haps, was vexed so in hart. And thence the woful louers were to seueral prisons led, Wheras on hard Alectos food, their heauy harts are fed, Bewayling their accursed fates, that spighte should so preuayle To worke their deaths, whose mutual wils did neuer once assayle To do no yl, but only bent their constant loue to frame, For loyal proofe, did nere deserue this thryce vnhapppie shame. And only looking for the time of death, deuoyd of ioye, With mournful tunes and painful plaints bewayling thir anoy, They spende the drousie doleful daye, as ready prest to pyne, Through pinching sorrowes, whom a while I forced to resine Unto their griefs, must now apply my trauel to pursue The cares of Pecipaters case, whose sorrowes eke renue, And be vncessantly so vext that stil he woful lyes. Bewayling Pesistratus woes with sundry plaintiue cries, Accursing fortunes tickle trade, as eke the villains spight, Whose accusation had defast the fame and credit quite, Not onely of Pesistratus and of his Sisters state, But also of him selfe, whose wealth depended on their fate. Which well he waying, was inforst with heauy hart to plaine, And was not able vexed man, his dolours to restraine: But after long pervsing of his griefes, he payned sayde: Oh blinded foole, what fond conceits hath made thee thus dismaide? Dost thou not know thy proper lawes be so, that who accusde Of other is, by cause himselfe by custome is refusde To fight in proper his behalfe, he must a champion haue, Whose hand victorious must intende the accuzeds life to saue? And why dost thou not then prepare more rather to prouide, In these the Innocents defence, to haue thy manhood tride, Than for to grieue thy pined hart in such a paineful guyse, Which neither doth pretende thy ease, their helpe, nor thee for wise? Go rather to the wretched wight Pesistratus, and learne If that he gilty be or no, by whom thou maist discearne With equall eye, the likelyhoode thereof, and maist dispose Thy deedes accordingly, which thought, he presently arose, And went in haste vnto the mewe where Pesistrate remaynde. Whose person seene, the gladful man had thought that he [illeg.] gainde A happy pray, and then he sayde, my friend, alas I wayle, To see thy wretched case so much in hart, that tong doth faile To vtter what my meaning is: but faithful friend disclose Unto thy friend, if guilty thou or innocent in those So bainous faultes be, yea, or no, that to thy charge are layd? To which so spoke, Pesistratus againe replying, sayde, That as the mighty Ioue of heauen his recompence should make, They sought no creatures death, nor harme, nor once did vndertake Such minded mischeefe or pretence: and then he opened all The matter to Pecipater, as how that eche was thrall To others loue, long tract of time before ?that? it was knowne. And by what lucklesse meanes, at last their zealous loue was showne. As, how that vnto Antropos his secrets be discride, By whom the letters first were sent, and matters all were tride, Yet to none other end at al, but only touching loue, And nothing else was euer ment, as wel the letters proue. And how the villaine, priuie to the place of their resort, His forged tale hath now at last confirmd in such a sorte. Bicause that in the pointed place the louers both were found, Who meaned nothing, but to shew the fruites that did abound From louely stomackrs, as like case of louers doth frequent: This sayde, wel quod Pecipater, doubt not I shal preuent His spitful grutch, so much as shal apply to him the shame, That he had thought to both of you, by forged tale to frame, And then bequeauyng Pesistrate to Gods, he did depart From thence at somewhat better ease, and with more lighter hart Than erst, when thither he approcht, and then to prison hide Wheras the woful Catane his dolefull sister layde: Of whom the matter asked, he like aunswer had againe, As did agree to Pesistrats, wherby he iudged playne The louers to be innocent, and that the fayned lye Of villayne Antropos was false, as he might wel espye: Wheron Catanea left, the wight his sorrowes fled away, Did to his home repaire, wheras the longing man did stay Til season such as poynted time was present come, when as The accused wights (their dungeons left) to place of death should passe: Where if they had no Champion prest, their liues for to defend, They must prepare with harts addrest to take their latest ende. He then supposing to proceede in their behalfe to fight, And with the villain Antropos, to straine his ventured might, And so content, til season that to stay he liues in hope. And when in space the tract of time had compassed his scope, And that the proclamation made before, for poynted tyde: The time expyrde (as time in hast without respect doth glyde) The season is approcht, the accusde are from the prisons brought To forsayd place, wheras their deaths of hangman must be wrought, Except that Champion were addrest their doubted liues to saue, By conquest got: who happy wights, a valiaunt Champion haue, The which vnknowne to them appears, in Sabels armour dight, And settled wel on barbed steede, doth offer for to fight With villayne Antropos, whose guyle had done extortious wrong, He sayde, to Innocents, as he would proue ere it were long: And therewithal Sir Antropos doth enter into listes, And with a Lyons face he sayth, what caytife here resists The certaine witnesse I do beare, and saw with propre eyes? To whom quoth Pecipater, I it is who wel espyes Thy forged accusation false, and shal performe the same Upon thy carkas, spight of force, to thy deserued shame, Thou villaine slaue (quoth Antropos) wilt thou in the defence Of Traytours, venture to withstand my rygorous sharpe dispence? And darest thou (replyed he) presume to meete my force In quarell false, as shal be provde vpon thy caytife corse? Yea sayde the one in spight of thee, a quarel iust vpholde And Mauger thee (the other quoth) suppresse thy pryde so bold: Wherin the Heralds sownd displayd the Coursers meete with speares In settled restes, that trunchions burst, the peeces pat their eares, And then with glauering blades the blowes were delt in such a wise, That harnesse patde, the parings mount aloft into the skies, And sparkels beaten from their sides, the Targets strong are torne; The bars vnbound, the helmets hard by force asunder shorne, The steely linkes vnbeaten, bounst, and thus the mortal fight, Now quauming the accused harts now making stomacke light, The one he thinketh of reuenge, on Pesistrate, wherby With Serpents rage in finisht hast he lets the blowes go flye: To other striuing for to saue his friendes from foes dispight, Like Lyon fierce he yeeldes againe the blowes with forcing might, And thus the aduersaries so, had made their partyes good, That they had dyde the stained ground with their diffused bloud, So long, til at the last the knights thus straining manly strength, Pecipater had pierst the sides of Antropos at length, And so courageously pursude his foe with desperate blade, That downe fell Antropos to earth, his fatal wound so made: Whom Pecipater straight supprest with foote, and from the ground With valiant stroke he made his head from conquered corps rebound. Wheron with strained loftie voice, the people movde such cries, That through their hie conceiued ioyes they shakt I thinke the skies. And now the louers were so glad, as though their liues renewd. Their happy state with heauenly ioyes and pleasures were indude, But little deemed Pesistrate the riddance of his paine To come by death of Kenedox his brother, that was slaine. Whereon they cravde to see the face of viliant him, that so Had saued their liues, and maintaind truth and vanquished the foe. And when his helmet laide aside the louers sawe to be Pecipater, and people viewd and knew that it was hee, Oh how the people vaunst his fame, and ioyed to see their Lorde So valiant Knight, and yelded prayse to him with one accorde, As though their voices would haue raisde the man from mortal case, To hiest heauens for his desert, amongst the Gods to place: And so the louers ioyd in hart, requiting endlesse thankes For his aboundant curtesie, and manly Martial prankes: That it doth farre excel my power, to paint in proper wise, I therefore yeeld it to conceit of eche man to deuise. But when the turmoile ceassed was, and so the spite restrainde Of raging foe, eche hoping hart by manly proofe sustaind: Pecipater the conquerous knight, with comely courtly grace Proceedes to Pesistrate, and doth with seemely armes imbrace, Whom he with gesture like requites so courteously displayde, That they that viewde the ?seemely? sight, were so in hart dismaide, That teares by force distilling downe for ioy from seers eyes: Their fame of gentle gesture streight amongst the thickest hyes: And then his sister greeted like, she likewise greets againe, That wondrous was it to beholde, how erst in desperate paine, And now inioyes the altred time they spend in happy plight, With easy harts, vnburdend brests, and cause of al delight. And thus when outwarde vttrance had declarde eche ioyful minde, Eche man auoides the present place vnto his home assinde, And conquerous knight, with Louers doeth proceede with courtly traine, Through Tarents streetes, vnto the place whereas he should remaine, Who when he passed through the towne receiude such yelded fame, As eke the Louers for their truth that to behold the same, The tops of houses laden were, and streets and stalles so fillde, And windowes deckt with peoples prease as nere or very sild, Was like conuent in Tarent towne, the people were so glad Of constant Louers saued life, as eke bycause they had Unto their Lord so valiant wight as Pecipater was, Who with the louers and his traine, as stil though streetes they passe, At last arriued at the place of Pecipater, they With ioyful hart into his house do presently conuey Themselues, where pausde a little space Pecipater doth straine To Pesistrate his voice, and thus he sayde: thy griefe my payne It is Pesistratus, my friend, and what thou dost forbeare, I likewise feele, be it wo, be it wealth, be it losse, anoy or feare. Wherefore I craue thy curtesy, to yelde such like respect, To my good wil, as it regards thy selfe, as one elect Unto my selfe for faithful friend; as partly hath appearde By venture lately for thy sake, where rather I aspyrde To dye with thee, than liue deuoyde of presence thyne: wherfore Know friend Pesistratus, I do repute thy friendship more Than succour of the mightiest Prince or Mahomet aliue Whose hate were able to deuise my honour to depryue. Since therefore that thou dost suppose it for thy happiest ioy, Thy greatest wealth and riddance best from cause of al anoy, For to retaine Catanea my sister vnto thee, My worthy friend Pesistratus, I willingly agree, Unto the same, and what so else of me thou shalt request, To graunt thy sute at all assayes I am as ready prest: And since thou knowest the spittful grutch of Phetratus, beware Therof, and take aduise least thou incur a further care: For I forcast and see it well, that when that I deceast My sister clayms my ruling roome. (hir right) she shal supprest By currish caytife Phetratus, then stoope to euery yoke, Wherto hir carelesse vncle shal the wretched wench prouoke: And thou shalt likewise be so vsde, as wel I knowe, it shal (If that thou do not wel prouide) attaine thy latest fall. Harke therefore, oh my Pesistrate, attend what I shal say, If that thou liuest for to see my death, without delay Possesse my place in present hast, as into thy due right By Catane thy spouse, and hold the same by Martial might: For if the caytife Phetratus haue once his entry made Before thou canst attaine thereto, then knowe I, cruel blade Shal worke the death of both of you, or else your vtter spoyle, Wherby the pray shal be his owne, and yours shal be the foyle. Thus sayde Pecipater, and then he ceast for to apply His tong to further speech, to whome did Pesistrate replie, With thankes his gentlenesse requited, that his wil Should bee with executed care performed to the fil: And after other course of talke, the louers did require Their mariage shortly to be made, vnto the which desire Pecipter consented streight, wheron it was agreed At pointed time (which shortly was) that nuptials should with speed Prepared bee: and thus (their ioyes increasing happy wights) They did expect the wished time, and spend in much delights The ioyful tyde, til season that for which the louers stayde: Which time they hoped wel should now no longer be delayde. But wo, alas, to fortunes wyles, whylest thus they fed on ioye, And were perswaded that they had auoyded al anoy, Unhappy case (their cares renewd) they suffer greater griefes, Than al the former time, when state was voyde of all reliefs. For Phetratus accursed wight, supposing what defame Had growne to him through late abuse vnto his vtter shame, Began with rancour for to grutch at wealth of their estate, Since that himselfe was thralled so to such abased state: And gan deuise, that if he could allure it to such passe, That Pecipaters life were refte, that then the nuptials was Preuented, wherby he might then as ruler worke his list Upon the louers, when as none his pleasure durst resist: And thus the wretch supposing long, perseuering in his thought, At length deuised by this meanes to haue his purpose wrought, Which was to hyre some carlesse slaue with poyson to beguile Pecipater, and thinking thus, when he had pausde a whyle He calde to mind a certayne wretch that to him selfe retaynd, Whose disposition fit he knewe to haue these matters faynde: To him in presence he discryde the summe of al his minde, Who soone agreed, and was content to do what he assynde. And to conclude, when thus they had decreede on poynted tyde, The place, and by what secrete meanes the treason should be tryde, The wicked seruant did prepare his medicine to frame, The which so pampered, as he would, when he had done the same, In secret sorte he did conuey himselfe vnto the place Wheras Pecipater did vse to sit in iudgements case, Where he impoysned the seate with his infection strong, And euery other thing that did vnto the seate belong, And then in hast retyred home: and when the approched day Was come, when Pecipaters vse was for to take his way To forsayde place, wheras he did the controuersies cease Of common wealth, &amp; did mayntayne the course of publike peace, When as (alas) the worthy wight had sitte a whyle in seate, He gan in such a heated wise in euery part to sweate, That they that sawe the valiant so distempered, thought the route Of people to haue causde the same, wheron they caryed out Their Lorde into the open ayre, and there the woful wyght With deadly disagreeing colde streight struck, in open sight Unto the heauens resinde his ghost, hys carkas left on ground, Wheron was movde so great a noyse and such a piteous sounde, That well I deeme the earth did shake withal and rolling skyes Were out of common course declinde through such their mourneful cryes: The which when Phetratus had heard, and knowing it to bee His purpose, wrought as though y? wretch had only come to see The cause of rumor, with a route of thousand caytifes there, He present was bycause of doubte and his suspected feare That people would accused hym, wheras with outward shewe He so lamented, that noue would had iudged him the foe Of Pecipater, for he ragde as though the wretched mad Had bin for grief: when God did know the cursed was as glad Of his successe in mischiefe wrought, as he that had restrainde With Martial fist, a vanguisht hoste, or summes of golde had gainde. And then he so persuaded with the people, that at rest The body was conuayde from thence with euery thing addrest For funerals in solemne wise: and when the season cravde That carkasse should be layde in earth, eche thing was so behaude, That least, the people did suspect that Phetratus had wrought The death of Pecipater, or such thing he would haue sought Whereon they suffred him to rule, til season that they might More better know to whome the same were incident by right. But oh the deadly pinching pains and greeuous grisly smarte That bannished the louers ioyes, and gript them at the hart, When woful wretches they so sawe the increase of ceaslesse care Through worthy Pecipaters death, which causde their mournful fare That they vncessantly bewaylde with tears their fickle fate, Wel knowing that dispight would cleane suppresse their quiet state, As woful wights to them it fell, it did as they did feare: For when the villayne Phetratus did see, that for to beare Authority he suffred was, now minding to dispight The louers, seeing eke the time so apt, that wel he might Indeuor his malicious wiles, to worke their vtter thrall, The wicked man to counsel doth the chief and Nobles cal Of his dominion, vnto whom in presence thus he sayde. As I my Lords, so likewise you I know are much dismayde Through cause of Pecipaters death, and since a great defame It were to vs, if slightly we should ouerpasse the same, I craue your curtesies to heare, and hearing well to way What thing as touching this, I am disposed now to say: You know how that the exile man Pesistrate, hath attainde The loue of Catane, whose wil would wisely be restrainde, For how that Kenedox accusde Pesistrate, it is plaine With reasons proofe, that he should seeke through priuie impoisned baine My death: and note you wel of this, that he that hath so sought My death, whose death no whit at al could pleasure him in ought Would likewise seeke the death of him (Pecipater I meane) Whose death would yeelde him title suche wherto the wretch might leane Through Catane, for to possesse the roume which he supplide, Wheron I do presume, that he, if it were throughly tride, Were only woorker of his death, through hope of forsayd gayne: I therefore do aduise you, that the wretch do not remayne In these our partes, but that exilde he be, wherby we shal Both Catane the dame reserue from such a shameful fall As shee would get, if to the slaue the Lady matched were, And eke auoyde such rumors, as the people would arere. And so he stint to speake: and they with one accorde agreed, That Pesistrate, as he hadde sayde, should be exild, with speede. Wheron for Pesistratus they did send by verlet streight, To whom in presence they declard the important cause of weight, And there commaunded him, that then without a more delay, As man exilde, from present place hee toke his ready way To forraine parts informing eke that if that he were found Upon such day, in any place of their Italian ground, That he should dye: wheron the wight began his iourney made With heauy hart in mourneful plight, and presently doth vade Tarentum lest, as wandring wretch into a Forrest by, Whereas he stayes his lothed limmes a while at ease to lie. And when his musing braines had tost the losse of former ioyes, And that his fansie fixly fed vpon a thousand toyes, At last, he pondering the cause of cares that so befel Unto his pay, his griping greefes so greeuously did quell His hauty courage, that by force his fainting limmes declinde, That woful lay, as though he were a body reft of minde, Until a space that season had restord the course againe Which did reuiue his vital sense: and then in greater paine Than erst, the wretch bewaild, wherein vnto his dolors ?yokt?, Through painful fits, his faultring tong to speake was thus prouokt. Alas what wretch doeth greater greefes sustaine, than I abide? Or whose estate is more than mine by fortunes spite defide? Or whose excesse of troubles, teare his paineful pinched hart So much, as my vncessant cares do worke my deadly smarte? In propre soyle I sometime liude a man of great renoune, And now like slaue in forreyne partes I am suppressed downe And sometime haue I in my ioyes aduaunst my selfe with fame, But now accurssed in my griefes I liue with exile name. And woe to fortunes spiteful trade. a ioyful louer late I was, and Lady had, but now to vacabonds a mate: Alas, alas, and wilt thou then (Pesistratus) delay To worke thy death? wilt thou abide to see an other day? Thou hast no cause of hope at al, for thou hast Lady left, And thus exilde, art from hir sight for euer cleane bereft. And likewise bannisht from thy ioyes: for how canst thou delight In any thing, since voide thou art of Cataneas sight: And canst thou now forbeare, to liue like seruile slaue againe. In toyling trade and skorned state? and canst thou so restraine Thy noble nature, when as erst deuoyde of eche anoy. Thou didst in ten times happy time thy Ladies loue inioy? No, no, thy louing hart may not indeuor for to pant In vital sort, if that thou shouldst thy Ladies presence want. Why therfore lingrest thou to stop (quoth he) thy vital breath? And therewithal the desperate man did draw from secrete sheath His blade, wherwith the wretched men: to make his woful ende, But that the mighty God of heauens did happy succoure send: For by good chaunce, in Forest was a sheephearde seeking there A strayed sheepe which he had lost, who hapned nere Unto the place where Pesistrate complaind, and secrete he Behinde a thicket standing, did the forsayd matter see: Who ran to Pesistrate in hast, as so he was disposde To take his death: and on his knees the sheepheard thus disclosde: Oh seemely Knight, auoid this act, and suffer not thy fist To do thy death, let manly hart thy forcing pangs resist: Wouldst thou condemne thy spiritual soule for matters that be vaine? Or dost thou deeme that such thy death would rid thee of thy paine? No Lord, it would ingender more such matter as thou knowst, Skorne therefore this, and do disdaine such matter as thou shewst: And worthy Knight, let courage quaile the causes of thy care, And time, no doubt, shal bring againe to thee thy ioyful fare: And though that thou exiled art from present land, wherin The cheefest comforts do consist, yet let thy stomacke win Thy victory from doubts dispayre, and do as I shal say, Since that thou meanest not from hence thy presence to conuay, But here wouldst liue, bycause thou maist by some aduentured wise Thy Ladies seemely face beholde, for fansies fears suffise, Get shepheardes weeds of simple kinde, with tarboxe, dogge and hooke, And other things that ought to be of shepheards vndertoke: And so disguisd, thou mayst vnknowne remaine in quiet ease, And vnderstand thy Ladyes state, which stomacke shal appease: And I pretending openly thy fellowe mate, shal be Thy humble seruant to commaund, in ought to pleasure thee. Which sayde of shepheard, Pesistrate did curteously requite His good aduise, and thanking Ioue for sodaine such delite, Agreed to al the shepheard had declard, and did deuise In euery poynt (as he had sayde) himselfe so to disguise: And to conclude, departed thence to silly cottage by Of shepheards, where the forsayd feat they purposed to try. And thus Pesistratus, become a shepheard, and bedeckt With such accordant robes as doth belong to shepheards seckt: As boode on head, and hooke in hand, and fastned dogge by side, And budget, tarbor, and such tooles of shepheards lusty pride: In such his office for a space I leaue, and shal intend To Catane my simple stile, who (woful wench) doth spende The lothsome time in ceaslesse mones, bewayling spiteful fate, That so such sundry sorowes should oppresse hir hauty state: And thinking that Pesistrate had like faithlesse fayning Knight Forsaken hir, for doubted feare of Phetratus despight, Bycause she knew not, how exilde he was through the consent Of nobles (so in secrete was it kept of the conuent) Nor howe he could not take his leaue of hir, bycause in hast He was compeld to take his way: The Lady doth so wast For pining greefe, that wonder 'twas to see how she was changde From former hewe, in vexed brest hir doleful dolors rangde In such a wise, and euery day the Lady would defame The Knight in such reuyling sort vnto his caused blame, In open presence vnto such as would to hir attende, That pitie was it to beholde, how to a paineful ende She liues in earth: and ceaslesse so she spent the ioyous dayes, And curst the Knight, and stil complains hir griefes and neuer stayes, But many times in desperate mood?s? indeuours with hir knyfe To splyt hir tender hart in twayne, and reue hir selfe of lyfe. And al these passions she sustaynde, bycause she only thought That Pesistrate had faynde, in al that he before had wrought, And bad bin fled, forsaking hir, whom woful woman thus In griefes I leaue: and gladly shal indeuor to discusse The happy chaunce that now befel vnto their ceaslesse ioyes, And yelded wished ease to them, auoyding al anoyes. VVhen long the Aganetians had in Appollonia soyle Remaynde, without a gouernour that should defend their foyle, They waying how that ought they had of Pesistratus heard (To be in Italie) agreed to haue it not defeard, But that in presente hast there should a posting verlet vade, By whom in Italie there shoulde be proclamation made, In all the chiefe and famous townes, conteyned in that land, (As wel as in the farthest coastes, so also neare at hand) That Kenedoxus was deposde from Aganetians right, And that the Aganetians will was bent, that worthy Knight Pesistratus, if so disposde he were, should now possesse Their lands and Lordships, as the heyre, whose right they do confesse It is, and after such consente the verlet, ouerpast The surging seas, in happy time arriued hath at last Italian partes: and there by chaunce he traueld vp the way, Whereas Pesistrate keeping sheepe did silly shepheard stay: Of whom the varlet, passing by, demaunded if he knewe A straunger, who Pesistratus was hight, yea, God indew The man with many more good gifts, I know the Knight ful wel, (Quod Pesistrate,) and in the towne of Tarent doth he dwel. And then the messenger declarde the cause, why he was sente Into those partes, and told the whole of forsayd his intent. And after course of common talke, the shepheard thankt, he hies In hast from thence, and Pesistrate surmising, wel espies That Aganetians in distresse were ouer chargde with foes, Whereon aduisde, in present hast the happy man he goes To fellow shepheard and declares the whole that hapned had, Who hearing of the lucky chaunce was simple man much glad, That such vnlooked for successe allotted to the pay Of Pesistrate, who shephearde left, doth take his ready way In former costlye roabes yclad (his shepheards weedes resinde For shepheards vse) to natiue soyle, wheras by prosperous winde And lucky ship, in season short arivde, he forward wends To Appollonia, and from thence a friendly letter sends Unto the Aganetians, who in solemne wise do meete Their worthy kinsman, whow likewise Pesistratus doth greete With trickling teares from eyes distild, wheron the ioyful knights In happy state togither spend the time in all delights: And then informing Pesistrate of foes dispiteful rage, The valiant knight doth study much their fiercenesse to asswage, By whose aduise and wise forecast they gaue their foes the foyle, And then did rest in quiet ease and gouernde wel their soyle. Of whom the Ruler Pesistrate assynde by one accord Of Aganetians whole consent, he liues a noble Lorde, And after space that his estate was quietly disposde, To Aganetians present al the valiant knight disclosde With long oration, how his fates in Italy befel, And how in happy state a space in Tarent he did dwel, And how the spight of villaine one had wrought him such anoy, And diuers times exylde his haps from cause of chaunced ioy, And then declaring of the Dame Catanea, he shewes, Hir noble state and hauty bloud: which Fama no more blowes Of duty than of hir desert: whose loyal loue attainde Of him he tolde, and how by spight the same was stil restrainde From his effect, whereon he craude the Aganetians ayde And patience, that an army might to Tarent be conuayd, Wheras the towne besiegde, he would obtayne his proper right, Which was the Lady, spite of foes in open chalengd fight: Or else with army ouercome by force their hauty pride, And suffer not one foe aliue in Tarent to abide. To which request, it was agreed of Aganetians all, With Pesistrate to liue and die to rise and likewise fal. Then in hast ?every thing? prepard, and al things ready prest, With warlike nauies they ariude at Tarent, there do rest. And after wise aduise, agreed to send to Tarent streight A Herault dight, for to declare the important cause of weight, Who with his message wel preparde, did hast, without delay, To Phetratus, to whom approcht, the Herault did display That Pesistrate not little skornes the fond disdaineful pride And open wrong that he had done to him, as should be tride Upon his body, if be dare in combate stand to proue The same, as by his propre lawes and custome doth beboue He should: or else with armies force he would the Tarents spoyle As neuer towne before that time receiued such a foyle: Which message done, it was replide of Phetratus, that death Should be his pay, and he with blade would stop his propre breath Before that once he would deny in combate for to fight With Pesistrate: whereon he sayd to Herault, that he might, Pesistrate tel, that he was mente incombate for to trye Against the traytour, that he did like faithlesse caytife lye, To say that he had open wrong bycause he was restrainde From Catane, for neuer hee hir loyal loue retainde: And then, as there the custome was, with solemne oth he sware, That iust his quarel was and that therin no cauels are. And then the day appointed, when the combat should be fought, The Herault hyes to Pesistrate, and tels how eche thing wrought, And how that Phetratus agreed, in combate to mayntaine His quarel good, as he would proue, (he sayde) vnto his paine: For which expected time he stayes. But oh the great reliefes, Catanea (happy) did conceyue, auoyding al hir griefs, When thus she sawe the constancie of Pesistrate, I deeme The woman thought hir ioyes so great as she should Goddes seme. And when the time appointed nowe approched is, when knife Of manly knight must yelde him fame, and end the deadly strife: The Lady hath hir roome in place wheras the combate must Be fought. Where preasing from the midst of rout, the foes do thrust Their martial bodies vnto fight in ratling armour, set On barbed steed and then the booke of solemne swearing fet, The aduersaries both do vow this quarel to be good, And then the Knights with setled spear do seeke eche others bloud, And meete with such a thundring noyse as thunder claps from skye, Wherin ech body borne from steede with buckling forst to flye, They rise again, and with their blades so diuersly dispend Their friendlesse blowes, y? from their sides they fyery sparkles send With whizing blaze, in such a sorte as wondrous 'twas to sight, To view the desperate dole of force, and fiercenesse of their fight, But at the last the courage of sir Phetratus did quaile, The which espyed of Pesistrate so faintly for to faile, Renewde with sight of Ladies grace his strength did so abounde, That with a valliant stroke from corps he draue his head to ground. And then the people movde their shootes, and caps did cut the ayre, And happy man Pesistrate had obtainde his Lady fayre, Whose mutual ioyes did so excell, as farre it doth exceede, Of any hart to be comprisde: and through his martial deede, He wan the peoples fauor so, that euery wights consent, That he should raigne in Tarent towne was very wel content: Wherby aduaunst to hauty fame, the Louers both at rest, The right of mariage had) inioyde theyr loues, and (cares supprest) Did spend their dayes in ceaslesse ioyes, and died in quiet peace: Whose like successe in loyal loue the mighty Ioue increacee.
