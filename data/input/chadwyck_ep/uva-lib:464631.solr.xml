A disputeson betwen the body and the sowle As i lay in a wynternyght, A litel drouknynge befor Ã¾e day, Me thoughte i sey a rewely syght, A body Ã¾ere it on bere lay. Ãat hadde ben a mody knyght, And litel served god to pay; Lore he hadde his lyves lyght; Ãe gost was oute and wolde go way. And whanne Ã¾e gost it shulde go, It withheld and withstood, And loked on Ã¾e body Ã¾at it cam fro, Ful sorwefully with drewery mood; And seyde: âAllas and welewo! Ãou fekele flessh, Ã¾ou false blood! Why lyst Ã¾ou Ã¾ere styncand so, Ã¾at whylome were so wyld and wood? Ãou Ã¾at were wene to ryde, Hye on horse in and out, So queynte a knyght and kid so wyde, And as a lyon fers and proud, Where is now Ã¾y m[u]che pryde, And Ã¾y los Ã¾at was so loud? Why lyst Ã¾ou Ã¾ere with bare syde, Prikked in so povere a shroud? Wher are now alle Ã¾y ryche wedes, Ãy somers and Ã¾y ryche beddes, Ãy proude palfreys and Ã¾y stedes, Ãat Ã¾ou aboute with Ã¾e leddes? Ã¾e grehoundes Ã¾at were wont to grede, And Ã¾o faukons Ã¾at Ã¾ou feddes? Me thenketh Ã¾y good is Ã¾e ful gnede, Now alle Ã¾y frendes are fro Ã¾e fledde. Where are now alle Ã¾yn hey toures, Ãy chambres and Ã¾yn hye halle, Ãat peynted were with proude floures, And Ã¾y [ry]che robes alle? Ãy curtyns and Ã¾y covertoures? Ãy sendele and Ã¾y ryche palle? Loke, wrech, where is now Ã¾y boure; To morwe Ã¾ou shalt Ã¾erein falle. Where are now Ã¾y cokes snelle, Ãat shulde go to greyth Ã¾y mete With ryche spyces, for to smelle, Whan were set for to frete, To don Ã¾y foule flessh to swelle, Ãat now shal wylde wormes ete? And ine Ã¾e stronge peyne of helle With Ã¾y glotony Ã¾ou hast gete. Where ar Ã¾y glemen, Ã¾at shulde Ã¾e glewe With harpe and lute and tabourbete? Ãe piperes, Ã¾at Ã¾o bagges blewe, And Ã¾at Ã¾ou yaf Ã¾o yiftes gre[te], Ãe ryche robes, elde and newe, To yelpe of Ã¾e, where Ã¾at Ã¾ey sete? Swyche trifelons evere ontrewe Of Ã¾e Ã¾ey hadde gret beyete. For to bere Ã¾y word so wyde, And make of Ã¾e rym and raf, Swyche men for pompe and pryde Largely of Ã¾yn Ã¾ou yaf. Ãe povere Ã¾ou lete ay be syde, For evere Ã¾ou hem overhaf; And if Ã¾ey came in any onryde, Ãou yaf hem dyntes with a staf. Fro Ã¾e pore Ã¾ou it nam, Ãat many a glotoun eet and drank; Nevere Ã¾oughtest Ã¾ou of wham, Ne hoo Ã¾erefore ful harde swank. Ãe ryche were welcome whan Ã¾ey cam, Ãe pore were strike, til Ã¾ey stank. Now is al gon with goddes gram, And Ã¾ou hast, wrech, ful lytel thank. Of al Ã¾at Ã¾ou togider drough, Ãou were hardere Ã¾an Ã¾e flynt; Swich shal make hem large inough, Ãat Ã¾ou haddest nevere ymynt; Ãou Ã¾at madest it so tough, Al Ã¾y bost is now stynt. And i may wepe Ã¾at Ã¾ou be lough, For al my blisse for Ã¾e is tynt. Wrech, nevere in al Ã¾y lyve Of worldes good were Ã¾ou sad; Now shalt Ã¾ou have lond ne lyth, But sevene fote, onethes Ã¾at. Now sest Ã¾ou wel, it shal Ã¾e kyth, Lore Ã¾ou hast Ã¾at Ã¾ou here gat; And now shalt Ã¾ou nevere be blythe, Of al Ã¾at oÃ¾er shal make hem glad. But to morwe whan it is day, Out fro kyth and al Ã¾y kyn Bare shalt Ã¾ou wende away, And leve here al Ã¾y worldes wyn. In proud paleys Ã¾ough Ã¾ou here lay, With wormes is now take Ã¾yn in; Ãy boure is beeld ful colde in clay, Ãe rof to reste upon Ã¾y chin. Where are Ã¾y markes and Ã¾y poundes, Ãy tresor and Ã¾y fayre fee Of al Ã¾y good fro roof to grounde, Bryght broches and many a bygh? Ho durste abate to Ã¾e grounde Ãy baner, whan it was reysed on hygh? Evele art Ã¾ou proved in a stounde, Ãy tayl is cutted Ã¾e ful nygh. Ãy false heyr is now ful fayn, Ãy fayre fe to undergo. Wel is him Ã¾is day, hath sayn, Ãat lytil good wele for us do. Ne wil he not now yeve agayn, To brynge us boÃ¾e to reste and ro, Of al Ã¾at lond a fote or twayn, Ãat Ã¾ou ful sinfully cam to.

Now are Ã¾o bannynges on Ã¾e lyght, Wrech, Ã¾ere i se Ã¾e lye, Ãat men have bede Ã¾e day and nyght, And sete on here knes to crye. But allas!

And whan Ã¾e gost with reuful chere Hadde Ã¾us mad Ã¾is sory mone, Ãe body Ã¾ere it lay on bere, A grisely thyng as it was one, Ãe hed uphaf and Ã¾e swere, As thyng al seek it yaf a grone, And seyde: âWhere hast Ã¾ou be my fere, Ãat art Ã¾us wrothly fro me gone?

I am not Ã¾e firste ne shal be Ã¾e last, Ãat shal drynke of Ã¾at nape; Nis non so kene Ã¾at he nis cast, Ãe pruddest is good to kepe his clape. What breydest Ã¾ou me Ã¾at i shal rote? So dede Sampson and Sesar; No man may now fynde a mote Of hem, ne of here moderes Ã¾at hem bar. Wormes gnowe ato here throte, So shal Ã¾ey myn, i am wel war; Ãere deth fyndeth Ã¾e dore ope, Helpe may non ageyn char. Whan i seygh boÃ¾e clerk and knyght, And oÃ¾er men be gates go, Heye halles and boures bryght I wende to have had mirthes mo. I was a man of mochel myght, And wende to have lived evere so; My dwellyng here ful faire i dyght, And deth hath put me now Ã¾erefro. My wonyng worthyly here i wrought, And thoughte have leved yeres fele; Brode wonges and wodes i bought, With al Ã¾at evere i myghte spele. Now is al went ageyn my thought, And deÃ¾, Ã¾at can ful stilly stele, Hath me dreve awey with nought, And oÃ¾ere towelden al my wele.

Ãat may i prove with wordus lyte, And with resoun, if Ã¾ou wilt; Ãou art to blame, and i al quyte, Ãou shuldest us fro wo have shilt. God shop Ã¾e after his owen shaft, And yaf Ã¾e boÃ¾e wit and skill; And in Ã¾y lokyng was i laft, To doon after Ã¾yn owen wille. Ne wist i nevere of wichecraft, Ne what was good, ne what was ille, But as a beste doumb and daft, And as Ã¾ou leddest me Ã¾eretille. To Ã¾e was i take to yeme, A witles thyng as i was born, And sith to serve Ã¾e to queme, BoÃ¾e on eve and on morwn. But Ã¾ou Ã¾at dedes coudest deme, Schuldest have ben war beforn Of my synne and my folye; Ãerefor Ã¾ou art Ã¾yself forlorn.â Anima dicit ad corpus. Ãe soule seyde: âBody be stille! Where hast Ã¾ou lerned al Ã¾is wit, To yeve me Ã¾is answer grille, Ãer Ã¾ou lyst bolned as a bit? Wenest Ã¾ou, wrech, Ã¾ough Ã¾ou fille With Ã¾y foule flessh a pit, Of al Ã¾at evere Ã¾ou hast doon ille, Ãat Ã¾ou so lyghtly shalt go quit? Wenest Ã¾ou, wrech, to gete grith, Whan Ã¾ou lyst roten in Ã¾e clay? Nay, Ã¾ough Ã¾ou rote boÃ¾e pile and pith, And al toblowe with Ã¾e wynd away, Yet shalt Ã¾ou come with lime and lith Ageyn to me at domes day, And come to courte, and i Ã¾e wyth, For to kepe oure ryght pay. To loke, Ã¾ou sayst, Ã¾ou were me taught, But sin Ã¾ou coudest of any qued, With Ã¾y teth Ã¾e brydel Ã¾ou raught, And dedest al Ã¾at i Ã¾e forbed. To sinne and shame was Ã¾i draught, To sorwe and to wrechedhed; And i ofte ageyn Ã¾e faught, But ay Ã¾ou toke Ã¾yn owen red. And whann i monewed Ã¾e soulened, Masse to here and evesong, Ãe must ferst doon oÃ¾er dede, And seydest it was an ydel gong. To ryver or to chace Ã¾ou yede, OuÃ¾er to courte to deme wrong; But if it were for pompe and pryde, Ful lytel good Ã¾ou dedest among. Ho may eÃ¾er more treson do, Or his owen lord better engyne, Ãan he Ã¾at al his trost is to, And with him is his owen hyne? Evere sin Ã¾ou was thrive and thro, And with Ã¾at al Ã¾e ways was ryne, Ãe Ã¾ou purveydest reste and roo, And me Ã¾ou dyghtest hellepyne. So many tymes were Ã¾ou taught, Ãat we boÃ¾e shulde have; But lytel gaf Ã¾ou of Ã¾at, Ãough Ã¾ou seye fader and moder grave. Ãou dest as Ã¾e world Ã¾e bad, And as Ã¾yn owen flesh wolde crave; I suffred Ã¾e, and dede as mad, To be my lord, and i Ã¾y knave. Now may wylde bestes renne, Hiden hem under lynde and lef; And foules fle be fryth and fenne, Sithen Ã¾y false harte clef. Ãyn eyen are blynde and kun not kenne, Ãy mouth is doumb, Ã¾yn eren def; And Ã¾ou Ã¾at lyst here grennende, Fro Ã¾e cometh a wikked wef. Ait corpus ad animam. Ãe body groned and gan to sayn: âGost, Ã¾ou hast gret wrong iwys, Al Ã¾e gilt on me to layn, Ãat Ã¾ou hast lorn so moche bliss. Where was i be wode or weye, Sat or stood or dede amis, Ãat i nas evere under Ã¾yn eye? Wel Ã¾ou wost Ã¾at soth it is. Ãou Ã¾at was so worthly wrought, Ãou seyst i made Ã¾e my thral; Al Ã¾at evere Ã¾e of rought, Ãou it dedist and i withal. Ne missayde i nevere nought, Ne misdede in stede ne stal, Ãat ferst of Ã¾e [ne] com Ã¾e thought. Abye ho it abye shal! What wyst i of wrong or ryght, What to take or what to done, But as Ã¾ou puttest in my thought, Ãat al Ã¾e wisdom shuldest have cone? For whan i dede any onryght, And eft sones Ã¾ereof gan mone, Ãan layde i al my myght, AnoÃ¾er tyme to have my wone. But haddest Ã¾ou, so God it yeve, Geve me hunger, thirst, and cold, And wissed me, Ã¾at no good knewe, But sorwe and wo and bismar bold, (For) Ã¾at i lered in my youthe, Had i holde, whan i was old; But Ã¾ou me lete gon north and southe, And have al my wil in wold. Wel wost Ã¾ou what was my kynde, And al mankynde is also, To have Ã¾is cursed world in mynde, And ay to coveyte mo and mo; Ãou shuldest have lete me be blynde, Whan i wolde to sinne go; But whan Ã¾e blynde ledeth Ã¾e blynde, In dych Ã¾ey falle boÃ¾e to. I shulde have be but as a scheepe, Or an ox or as a swyn, Ãat et and drank and lay and sleepe, Slayn and pased al his pyn; Ne nevere of catel nome ne keepe, Ne chose Ã¾e water fro Ã¾e wyn; Ne now ne shulde in helle deepe For Ã¾[e] suffre al Ã¾is pynâ. Anima dicit ad corpus. âA Ã¾ou foule flessh unsete, Now may i synge: Allas! allas! Ãat ever i Ã¾e saugh yete, For al my love on Ã¾e i las; Ãat Ã¾ou lovedest me Ã¾ou lete, And madest me an howe of glas; I tholed al Ã¾at Ã¾e thoughte swete, And evere to me tretour Ã¾ou was. Ãe fend of helle, Ã¾at hath envye To al mankynde, and ay hath had, Was aboute ay to aspye, To any good whan i Ã¾e bad. Ãe world Ã¾e stood to companye, Ãat maketh a soule ay adrad; Ãe wiste al Ã¾y folye, And made Ã¾e, wrech, blynd and mad. But whan i bad Ã¾e to Cryst calle, And leve Ã¾y sinne and almes do, Penance, fastyng, and for to wake, Ãe fend seyde: Ã¾ou shalt not so; Ãou shalt not al Ã¾y lust forsake, Ay to leve in sorwe and wo; Joye and blisse i rede Ã¾ou make, And thenk to live yeres mo. And whan i bad Ã¾e leve pride, Ã¾y many mes, Ã¾y ryche shroud, Ã¾e false world Ã¾e stood be syde, And bad Ã¾e boÃ¾e be queynte and proud; Ãi flesh with rych cloÃ¾s shryde, Not as a beggere in a clout; And on hye hors to ryde, With moche meyne in and out. And whan i bed Ã¾e erly ryse, And take of Ã¾y soule keepe, Ãou saydest Ã¾ou myghtest in no wyse, For Ã¾y mery morwesleepe; Whan ye had set yowre assise, For yow, thre tretours, sore i weepe, Ye me ladde thurgh yowre emprise, As Ã¾e shepherde doth his sheepe. And whanne ye hadde told yowre tale, Ayene me were ye alle sworen; Al ye helde but tryfle and tale, Ãat i hadde seyd beforen. Ye ledde me be doune and dale, Als an ox be Ã¾e horn; And us is brewed Ã¾is harde bale, Ãat we shal boÃ¾e be forlornâ. Corpus ait ad animam. And whan Ã¾e body saugh Ã¾e gost Swich dool and sorwe make, He seyde: âAllas! my lyf is lost. Ãat evere leved i for Ã¾y sake! Ãat myn harte ne hadde brest, Whan i was fro my modur take, Or ben into a pit icast, With an eddere or with a snake! For Ã¾an had i nevere wist, What was evel or what was good, Ne to Ã¾e world have had no trist, Ne suffred as i now mot; But for no seynt may ben oure bot To him Ã¾at for us shad his blod, Ãat we ne ben in helle brent, Of his mercy to don us boteâ. Anima dicit ad corpus. âCertis, now it is to late, For to preye or for to preche; Now Ã¾e wayn is at Ã¾e yate, And Ã¾y tunge hath leid Ã¾e speche. On poynt of oure sinne to bate, In al Ã¾is world now is no leche; We shal boÃ¾e gon o gate, Swich is Cristes harde wreche. But haddest Ã¾ou a lytel are, Whan us was lyf togidere lent, Whan Ã¾ou Ã¾e feltest seek and sare, Shrive Ã¾e and Ã¾e fend ishent, And have lete ronne on rewely tere, In weye of amendement, Ne thurst us nevere have had care, Ãat god ne wolde us wel defent. If alle Ã¾e men undur Ã¾e mone To deme us were set on benche, Ãe shame Ã¾at us shal be done, Ne myghte nevere on bethenche, Ne helpe us with bede ne bone; Ne us may no wyle wrenche. Hellehoundes come ful sone, Fro wham i may nowher blench. I ne may no lenger dwelle, For to stande and speke with Ã¾e; Hellehoundes here i yelle, And fendes mo Ã¾an i may se, For to fette me to helle, And i ne may nowhider flee; And Ã¾ou shalt come with flesh and felle At domes day and wone with meâ. Demonibus venientibus ad animam. And as it hadde Ã¾us isayd, It ne wiste whider to go; But sone it tok a braly brayd, Ãer cam a thousand fendes and mo; And whanne Ã¾e hadde on him layd Here sory clawes alle Ã¾o, It was in a sory playt, Rewly tugged to and fro. Summe were rugged, and summe tayled, With brode bunches on her bak, Sharpe clawes and longe nayles, Was non of hem withoute lak; On ilk halve it was assayled With many a devele blo and blak, Mercy it cryed, but nouht it vayled, Ãere god sent so harde wrak. Summe his chaveles al tobrast, And yoten in him led so hot, And beden him to drynke fast, And slunge him al aboute brod; A devele com Ã¾ere at Ã¾e laste, A mayster he was, wel i wot, A culter glowand in him he caste, Ãat thurgh his harte sone it smot. Gleyves glowande summe sette To bak, to brest, to boÃ¾e syde, Ãat at his harte Ã¾e pointes mette, And maden him Ã¾o woundes wyde; Ãey asked him hou wel he lette, Ãat evere was so ful of pryde; Yef he hadde Ã¾at him was behette; For more him shulde sone betyde. WorÃ¾y wedes for to were Ãey seyde Ã¾at he loved best; Bryght breny for to bere Hot brennyng on him was kest, With starke haspes for to spere, Ãat faste sat to bak and brest; A helm Ã¾at was litel to were, And an hors Ã¾ere com ful prest. He broughte forth a brydel tyd A cutted devele as a cote, Ãat loude neyed and gaped wyd, Ãe leye lemed out of his throte, With a sadel to midsyde, Ãat ful of sharpe nayles sote, Als he shulde to helle ryde, Al glowande ilk a grote. Whan he was in Ã¾at sadel shreven, As he shulde to tornament, An hundred develes on him dreven, Here and Ã¾ere was he hent; Of iche dent Ã¾e sparkes outsprungen, As a brond Ã¾at is forbrent, With hote speres was he stungen, With sharpe swerdes al torent. And whan he hadde riden his rode In Ã¾e sadel Ã¾ere he was set, He was doun cast as a tode, And hellehoundes to him let; Ãey brayd out Ã¾e peces brode, With reweful tales Ã¾ey him gret; On alle foure he gled on fote, Unethes myght he ferÃ¾er flette. Ãey ledde him forth upon Ã¾at low, With reuful res under Ã¾at rys, And bede he shulde hunte and blowe, And calle on Bemound and Beufys, Ratches Ã¾at him were wont to knowe, Sone Ã¾ey shulde blowe Ã¾e prys; And hundred develes on a rowe Dryve him dounward, unthank hys. Whan he cam to Ã¾at wretched wone, Ãe feendes yeve swich a yelle; Ãe erde opnede sone anone, Smoke and smulder up gan welle; Of Ã¾e pych and Ã¾e brunstone Men myht fele fer Ã¾e smelle. Lord god, wo is him begone, Ãat Ã¾ereof shal have halvendelle. Iterum de anima dicente et clamante ad salvatorem suum. And whanne Ã¾e gost Ã¾at syght sey, Whider it shulde, it kest a cry, And seyde: âGod, Ã¾at sittest on hey, On me Ã¾y shape Ã¾ou have mercy! Why schope Ã¾ou me Ã¾at were so sley? And Ã¾y creature was i, As many oÃ¾er Ã¾at sitte Ã¾e by, And Ã¾at Ã¾ou hast so wel don by. Ãou god, Ã¾at wistest al beforn, Why shope Ã¾ou me to wroÃ¾er hele, Ãus to be tugged and totorn, Or for to welden any wele? Allas Ã¾at tyme Ã¾at i was born! So may i say for Ã¾is unsele, For now i se i am but lorn, Ãere may no man Ã¾is doom repeleâ. Ãe fendes gunne ageyn to crie: âCaytif, it helpeth Ã¾e no more To calle on Jesu ne on Marye, Ne for to crave Crystes ore. Lorn Ã¾ou hast here companye, For Ã¾ou hast served us ful yore; Ãy bulted bred Ã¾ou shalt abye, As oÃ¾er Ã¾at leve upon oure loreâ. Ão fendes Ã¾at were of him fayn, Be top and tayl Ã¾ey hente it, And slongge it with a mody mayn Ryght into Ã¾e deepest pit, Ãere sunne nevere shall be seyn, Hemselve sunke doun with it; Ãe erde gan go togider ageyn, Ãat hole Ã¾ere was sone idit. Whan it was forth, Ã¾at foule lode, Fast it gan to drawe day; On ilk an her a drope stode, For fryht and fere Ã¾ere as i lay; To Jesu Cryst with mylde mode Faste i gan to crie and pray; I was so ferd, i was ner wode, Ãat i shulde have ben born away, I thanked him Ã¾at tholed ded, Hise moche mercy and his ore, Ãat saved me fro Ã¾at foule qued, A sinful wrech as i was Ã¾ore. Al sinful, i rede, sinnes leet, And shryve yow and rewe sore; Yet ne is no sinne so gret, Ãat Crystes mercy [n] is moche more. Now Jesu, Ã¾at us alle wrought, And shoop us after his owen face, And with his preciouse blood us bought. Of amendement yeve us space, Ãat Ã¾yn handwerk tyne nought, In Ã¾y blisful stede a place, Ãe joye Ã¾at Ã¾ou to us hast wrought, Ãou grante us for Ã¾yn holy grace. Amen.
