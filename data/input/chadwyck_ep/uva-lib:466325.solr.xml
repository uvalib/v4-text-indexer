      <field name="fulltext">I PRELUDE: ON BEACHY HEAD Town-dwellers think that Spring begins in May; We of the country know a certain day In February, when the shy young year Dreams her first dream of love. The skies appear Not cloudless with the steely gleam of frost, But tender, by soft-footed armies crossed, Vaunt-couriers of Queen Spring. The sleeping earth Remembers the green things that wait for birth In her wide bosom; and the thrushes stir To rouse the laggard morning earlier. On such a day, on such a happy day, A sevenfold party went on holiday Along the broad Downs looking o'er the sea From Bourne to Beauchef and the Charles' three, The Titans' turrets, on whose grassy knees Far down the curled red foxes sleep at ease, And though they hear far off the huntsman's hallo, Heed nothing, for they know no hound can follow. There coming, on the grassy edge they stayed, Thrilled with the glory of the ocean, laid A sapphire floor beneath them, and the gleam Of snowy cliffs to westward, where the stream Of Cuckmere stealeth to her lover's bed Betwixt the Seven Cliffs and Seaford Head. Silent they stood awhile, and watched the rise Of two great falcons wheeling up the skies In Babylonian gyres. And watched the mew Float from the grass-edge on to the void blue, Quietly spreading noiseless plumes of snow To join the unseen screaming flock below. Then one brake silence with a wistful sigh: âTen years of life for one day's wings to fly! Ah, the delights, consider! Ah, the joys! One moment to stand thus; the next to poise On the invisible unresisting air Empty and deep beneath you, and not care!â Echoed another: âAye, what loss is ours That Man, with all his thoughts and works and powers, Who might of wingÃ¨d kind have taken birth, Has ris'n among the beasts of middle earth! Glorious he were, if his long heritage, His ancestry of poet, hero, sage, His dreams, ambitions, raptures and desires, Had sprung and passed to him from eagle sires. What touch diviner his great words had ta'en, Truth, Freedom, Honour, Love, from tongue and brain Bred to the fearless mastery of wings, 'Mid clouds and snows and all ethereal things! What dreams had poets dreamed! and priests what prayer Uplifted! In his songs what sweetness were! A Lucifer unfallen Man had been, And none were ape-like, mischievous, or mean.â âAh, think you,â cried a third, âthat such a choice Were ever his? Had creature ever voice So infinitely fateful for his kind? Some first of creeping monsters, dumb and blind, Made he some great refusal, whence began The inveterate vulgarity of Man?â Then one, a poet: âI have found for you A history most fond and yet most true, Much to this purpose, for the tale is hight âThe Choice of Adam.â Hidden long from sight Within the pale leaves of a palimpsest, Ev'n as a ghost not wholly laid to rest Moves shadowy in a house of living men, So the blurred script may now be read again Athwart the faded lines of later writ. Deciphered thus, I have re-shapen it, Turning harsh Latin to an English lay.â Well suited this their mood of holiday And dreams of Springtide; and they sought a place Sun-warmed and windless on the chalk-cliff face. There is a hold, like a high gallery, hung Below the cliff-top, where a rock, down-flung From breaking scars, has rested and grown hoar. Above, the white walls tower; and before, Green-breasted Beauchef bows on naked knees O'er snowy feet kissed by the fawning seas. Rich is the eye-feast from that eagle-nest; Ruin of earth's foundations, crumbling crest And turret toppling, ledge o'erleaning ledge, Rampart and rock-face, till a far-off edge, Sheer as a bastion built of giant hands, Unruinous beyond the ruin stands. A passage, narrow as a turret-stair, Leads downward to this refuge whoso dare Face footless crags and white-lipped waves below. Thither one led them with sure foot and slow; And seated, quiet as a small grey flock Of sunning sea-birds on a lonely rock, In glad tranquillity they heard this tale, Like new bright fire kindled from ashes pale. THE CHOICE OF ADAM Perfected lay the green world wonderful 'Neath the Creator's eye, the blue air full Of wings and voices, and the solid ground Flushed all with flowers, while living creatures round Girdled the habitable globeâthe whole Fair to the sense and fairer to the soul. So were the five days ended, the great days Of God that are long Ã¦ons in man's gaze; And in the hush and rest-time of creating There seemed an expectation and a waiting, Seen in the flower and hearkened in the song, Felt in the unrest of the four-foot throng. And the Creator, reckoning every kind, Where were best lodging for the living Mind, And in what mortal the immortal strain Implanted fullest stature might attain, Out of the void compelled that dreaming spirit Which, bodied, should this five-days' world inherit, And be the living crown of things, a flower To nurse the seed of the creating Power; And to the cloudy spirit, knowing not As yet its own existence or the lot Destined, the Lord God gave in vision-wise Judgment, and hearing ears and seeing eyes, And bound the light thing to the winds, to bear A visitor of earth and sea and air; And, all things seen, and to his hand returned The bird-like spirit, questioned what was learned. Dominus Deus Hast thou beheld the world I made to be A throne, a temple, and a school for thee? Spiritus Adami Lord God Almighty, I have seen it all. Marvellous are Thy works in great and small. Dominus Deus Hast thou beheld the rivers and the seas, The lakes, and all that lives and moves in these? Spiritus Adami Lord, at Thy word I pierced the ocean's sleep, And saw the strange lamp-bearers of the deep; Around me, shuddering, monstrous shapes did swim; (What use of beauty in a day so dim?) Then rising from that thick unlighted grave Saw a faint emerald trembling through the wave, And knew of happier creatures who above In lighted waters play, and feel Thy love In sunlight and soft kisses of the wind; Which on the surface wanton with their kind, Or lie on sunny rocks afar from foes. All these I saw, and fairer things than those, Of mail-clad monsters and the silver flight Of wing-fish from the water; I had sight Of pink-sailed argosies on purple seas, And in rock-caverns found anemones Brighter than mountain flowers. All these I saw Living and moving by Thy changeless law. Dominus Deus Hast thou beheld the nobler lives that fare On earth and breathe the thin ethereal air? Spiritus Adami Unseen amid the multitudes I strayed, No more affrighting than a light cloud's shade. The gross-limbed monsters of the river-bed, The dainty dappled herd, the cavern-bred Carnivorous cruelties, the flying feet Of striped veldt-rangers, woolly flocks that bleat From crag to echoing crag, and chattering things That flit among the tree-tops without wings; These have I seen, innumerable in kind, Visible thoughts of Thy creating mind, Made, and unmade, and made again more fair, A thousand dying till one perfect were. Dominus Deus And hast thou followed, nearer to my feet, The aery warbler and the eagle fleet? Spiritus Adami In every bush I heard a living voice; From every tree one called to me Rejoice! About each cliff a thousand wings of snow Light-floated o'er the mirror sea below; High o'er the hills the eagle on sure wing Mounted, resistless as a falling thing; In dusky forests like a flash of flame The screaming rainbow-creatures went and came; Or, like a cloud, down lighted in the groves The chattering starlings and wing-rustling doves; And over stream and meadow restlessly Like leaves in whirlwind went the swallows by. No seas they fear, but, cradled on the wind, Leave winter and the deadly frost behind; Of all Thy creatures these are happiest, Of water, earth, and air alike possessed.â Then spake the Father: âI have given thee, Spirit of Man, the power to hear and seeâ Thyself yet formlessâevery creature formed; That Reason in thee, perfectly informed, Might choose her habitation, where to find Fittest enthronement for the o'erlording Mind In creature of the water, earth, or air. Consider thou what shape of these should wear One that shall be God's viceroy, governing By laws of Heaven every living thing; What strength or speed of limb, what grace of features, What gifts for help or judgment of all creatures. For I will give thee as thy racial right To live not only for thine own delight, Nor labour only for self-pleasing ends, As do the rest of creatures, who are friends To their own kindred, to all others foes. This gift I give thee, that is not in those: Justice to know and righteousness to seek, To give their own to warlike or to weak, And in the world, where blind self-love prevails, As officer of God to hold the scales. Therefore consider, ere desire be born With thy new body, and thy soul be torn Betwixt the god-like and the fleshly will! While reason in thee, pure of passion still, Can pass a selfless judgment, weigh the thing; And say what powers of fin or foot or wing Thou choosest to fulfil thy needs and Mine, Who made thee to complete the plan divine.â But on the soul of Adam fell a fear Of his high fate; and joy of eye and ear, Lent but to prove him, ev'n by this had grown Desirable, a thing to make his own; And he had seen a thousand glories, heard A hundred raptures, loves of beast and bird, Fierce ecstasies of battle or of lust. He sought how he might hold that splendid trust, Yet keep the license of the unreasoning beast, And, ruling, share full measure of the feast. And thus he answered: âWider are the seas Than the dry lands, and hugest forms are these That swim resistless in the yielding waves, East, West, North, South, or downward to dark caves. But these are farthest from the Father's care; Perchance Thou wilt forget Thy creature there, Forget Thy kindness and Thy love to him, Leave him unheld, unholpen, darkling, dim. Let me live rather 'neath the open skies, Hid but by passing clouds from Heaven's eyes. Yet if I choose the empire of the air, Haply some son of mine, too bold, shall dare To mount ev'n to Thy throne, to vaunt his soul Thine equal; then, flung downward from the pole, Ruin and wrath on all his kindred call. Or, should he shun so dread a rise and fall, Yet every weakness of his flesh, each sin, Little enough 'mid creatures kind and kin, So near Thy throne in Heaven's full light displayed, Shall seem a law tremendous disobeyed, And Man live 'neath a deprecated frown, Fearing each word may call Thy thunders down. Safest it were on middle earth to go, Neither presumptuous nor ignobly low. Stronger the will is, more the self-control, Rarer the fine perfection of the soul, For ordered lives that move but in one plane, Not up and down in gnat-dance free but vain. Ringed by the near horizon these discern The truths of Law and Limit, and return To half-browsed feeding-grounds, like sheep in pen, Using to utmost all that comes in ken. There are a thousand shapes, fair, strong, and fleet, That move upon the solid ground with feet, Yet on the water's face will sometimes fare, Or climb high hills to drink ethereal air. Let such a place be mine, where I may hold All creatures of earth, sea, and air controlled. Yet would I ask, not as the rest to be, But walk with head uplifted, that with Thee I may hold converse as Thine honoured one, Of all Thy children chief and favoured son.â Then spake the Almighty: âThou hast chos'n the Mean, The midway path, the kingdom of Between; And as thy choice shall be thy character, Clinging to earth, yet claiming to prefer Heaven, and pure thought and love, the boons of Heaven. Thus in thy noblest need to be forgiven Shall burn instead of joy in nobleness; Instead of song and glad light-heartedness, In every temple Sorrow's self shall house; Smoke of the sacrifice shall pay thy vows; And bodies lean and eyes with watching dim More righteous seem than health and pride of limb. Oh, hadst thou known thy good, and dared to be Lord of the air, a creature winged and free! Thou hadst been god-like then, Microuranos Instead of Micro-kosmos. Yea, thy loss Is great, and greater earth's, and greatest Mine. O marred impression of the stamp divine, Unperfect image of the sculptor's thought, A vessel of the potter badly wrought; Tyrant of earth, destroyer, ravisher, That shouldst have been an angel blessing her! Where'er thou walkest, scarred shall be the sod, That should have shown green footprints as of God. This is thy curse, self-called upon thy head. Yet see, lest thou be all uncomforted, Within thy breast I plant a seed of fire, Which kindle thou and feed with full desire, And it shall serve thee in the stead of wings To prompt thee ever to the higher things, And raise thee by slow steps and heights hard won Till thy race win the crown thou hast foregone. Only beware! In thine own hands is fate, To strain to higher or fall to lower state. A small thing is it to remelt the wax And strike again to perfect that which lacks. A small thing to the sculptor 'tis to fling His casting to the flames for bettering. A small thing to the potter 'tis to take Another lump and a new vessel make. And from the myriad myriad lives of earth A small thing were it to call up to birth A new, more perfect Man of grander mould, And in the slough self-chosen leave the old.â Darkness on Eden fell; and beast and bird Unnamed, unmastered slept. With dawn was heard A new compelling voice that thrilled the glade; And all the creatures, flocking, saw new-made Their white-limbed lord; and to his order came To own their fealty and receive a name.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">II PRELUDE: AT PEVENSEY CASTLE The year had put her sombre raiment by, The earth her snowy mantle long forgot; The lark's song rippled down the radiant sky, The full-toned ousel thrilled the gardenplat; All meadows were as pleasances, all seas As quiet lakes made for delight and ease. Then on a joyous eventide of June Again the seven light hearts set out together, With footsteps dancing and with thoughts in tune To Nature's gladness and the golden weather, To where the far-seen walls of Pevensey Rise from the levels, ivied, green, and grey. Ruined the place lies on the wide green lea, As on a lone shore a long-stranded ship, Forgotten plaything of the inconstant sea, Lies ruined; her no more the wavelets lip Nor billows buffet, nor her sailors' cry Sounds o'er the darkening waters lustily. The sand o'erflowing gluts her roofless hold; Stark are her ribs that kept the storms at bay, No more of service, though they stand as bold And apt of curve as on her keeling-day; A thousand she hath mothered: now not one Cares that she once was fair to look upon. Nor here is any life, or labouring hand, Or busy market, or defending arm; The walls, the towers, men toiled so long at, stand Outworn defences 'gainst forgotten harm; The grass that buries all things hath hid deep The hearth and roof-tree as the midden-heap. The Roman city and Norman citadel Are now one ruin, though their builders wrought A thousand years disparted. The green swell Of earth untrampled lies where Briton fought So fiercely with the engulfing Saxon horde, And Saxon slaved for Norman overlord. There they re-gathered from old chroniclers The scanty record; saw what was of yore Pictured by guess-work of geographers, And pieced to shape by antiquarian lore; Until the Present to the Past gave place, And earth before them wore her ancient face. Rose to their eyes in necromantic dream Wide marshes, tide-brimmed to a bright lagoon, Where, like November leaves upon a stream, The low bird-haunted eyots hung a-swoon; Till on the chiefest island grew one day The Roman fortress of Anderida. They saw the sentries, pacing on the wall, Look northward to the low hills, forest-crowned, Whence danger of the wild men might befall, And southward to the sea from out whose bound The swift sea-snake-like Saxon galleys came With threat perpetual of sword and flame. Till, when the waves of earthquake swept the world, Ring upon ring, as giant Rome went down, Thick as the snowflakes on the north wind whirled, The wild barbarian swooped on city and town; Vain were these marshes and these ramparts vain; To the last man were the defenders slain. Then in their talk they turned a later page, And saw the Norman vessels fill the bay. âAlmost,â said one, âthese walls might see engage The flashing hosts on Senlac's fateful day; Ev'n yet the eye on yon far upland sees Or fancies the great Abbey 'mid the trees.â Like little paper boats by children urged From the still margin out to the strong stream, So fancy, lightly loosed, was caught and merged In the full current of historic dream; And age on age they touched, and England's power And fortune followed to the actual hour. Then one: âWhat help hath History, or what gain The tale half told, half guessed-at, of dead days? A chilling mist that rises from past rain; A ghost that frights us from light-hearted ways; A parent's grief that darkens needlessly A child's delight and glooms its hour of glee. âOh, it were happier to record no strife, To note no battle-fields, to mark no graves, To drink untainted our own draught of life, And all unwistful watch the laughing waves; Blithely as they to dance in sunny hours, Sad only when the heaven above us lowers. âStrong is the race that hath no memory left Of its own past, except the hero-tale Or legend long-descended, a bright weft New-broidered on dim patterns worn and pale. The Tree of Knowledge yields no strong-man's meat; High purpose fails, fed on this evil sweet.â âAye,â said another; âyet what hand may guide The set career and destiny of Man? To say 'Twere better thus or thus; to chide Light fancy, or by philosophic plan Bind racial energiesâthis were a thing Vain-tempted as to check a planet's swing. âWe ride a rolling wave, and boast advance; We set the sail and labour with the oar To hasten or retard the moving chance, That bears us helpless to an unknown shore; And, proud of motion, like the Pharisee, Thank God we are not as men used to be. âO evil time when tender hearts were naught! O cruel hands that could no mercy show! O dark and heathen days ere pity taught To spare the weak and tend the wounded foe! Ev'n thus we murmur in our self-content, Sure that we face the fixÃ¨d Orient. âWe marvel that of such rude loins are we, The flower of human kind, begot and born; Nor question which to better end might be, Our soft lives or the barbarism we scorn. The wave rolls on; the generations ride Secure of progress each in its own pride.â âO ravens 'mid the ruins!â laughed a voice Low, girlish, light-of-heart. âThe soft June air Itself reproves your croaking. To my choice Better a fool's hope than wise man's despair. Let dismal Yesterday and dark To-morrow, SeÃ«r and sage, take thought for their own sorrow! âHath not our poet aught to fit the day, The mouldered place, the melting evening mood? For to a heart-sick world the poet's lay 'Twixt hope and wan-hope is a healing food.â Came answer: âWill ye hear another tale Rudely re-fashioned from that parchment pale?â There is a tower tall-rising, scarred and rent, Of Norman's building; and a broad-topped wall Beneath it. Here in sunshine and the scent Of golden wall-flowers, looking wide o'er all From emerald plain to purple promontory, Silent they sat to hear the poet's story. THE DEBATE OF THE LADY VENUS AND THE VIRGIN MARY Lone in a lonely land of wooded vales Queen Venus had a temple anciently; White dove-wings beat around it, and soft gales Blew spices thither from the neighbour sea. There was her ritual purest, and no sin 'Gainst man or nature ever entered in. Where was this land is now no word to tell, But somewhere in the warm west lands it lay; And seeing that now the world is mapped so well, Some place it may be where men live to-day; And for my part I would my faith advance This temple lay in some fair nook of France. But when the Cross triumphant beat to dust The antique temples and the old-world creeds, From this her temple was Queen Venus thrust, And devilish were accounted all her deeds; But, for the place itself was fit and fair, For the New Faith they raised a temple there. Through doors rich-carven with cadaverous saints Passed in the sad-robed brotherhood to prayer In lamplit darkness, where the mingled taints Of dead-men's bones and incense filled the air With holy drowse about the sculptured tombs, High-soaring pillars, and low-vaulted glooms. Many a saint was carved there, many a king From finial stared with sightless eyes of stone; But chiefest the Maid-mother, pitying, Held in her arms her babe, and stood alone, Human amid the inhumanities, Listening the whole world's whispered agonies. Passed the slow-footed ages, and the fame Of ancient Venus long had been forgot; Lost from the people's language was her name; Till once it fell that in the sacred plot A labourer, delving deep below the ground, A wondrous woman all of marble found. The Prior was a lettered man of Rome, And touched with the New Learning. He perceived At once the white-limbed goddess of the foam, And joyed in such a treasure so retrieved; And to the Chapter-house he bade them bear The wonderful white woman with due care. So came the banished goddess back once more To her old habitation. In the even Glimmered her glorious whiteness as of yore Through the dusk chamber, and a wondrous sweven That night on all the sleeping brothers came, And in the morn, lo, each had dreamed the same. The night was at its blackest, the vast vault Silent and dark as some deep ocean cave, Whose echoes never whisper doth assault, Nor ray pierced ever the thick ponderous wave; Only before the Mother and the Child One ruby star burnt like a beacon mild. Suddenly out of darkness spake a voice, Softer than the first bird that wakes the morn, And sweeter than the flutings that rejoice The mid-June starlight from the flowered thorn; âI am come again,â it said, âunto mine own. Woman, what dost thou in the goddess' throne?â The little ruby fire leapt suddenly, Like the quick flushing of a maiden's cheek; And answer breathed as sweet of melody And soft of murmur, but of tone more meek; âThis church,â it said, âthese altars are mine own. What false god claimeth Christ his Mother's throne?â Then came the answer, like a clear-toned bell That soundeth but one note, and yet doth thrill The throbbing air with various fall and swell, And ranging undertones, both deep and shrill, Half heard, half fancied by the entrancÃ¨d ear, And full of meanings of delight or fear: âThe natural delight of earth is mine, The joyous instinct in all things that breathe; The animal desire I made divine, And sweet as flowers that did my altars wreathe, I was a goddess lawful and devout, And lawful lovers thronged my feet about. âWhere are the half-god heroes of my day, The noble faces and the glorious limbs, The free decorous souls? These are not they, The lank-limbed starvelings, droning prayers and hymns, The creed-cramped souls, the dogma-darkened eyes, Who blacken earth to heighten Paradise.â A shudder through the dreaming brothers ran, And lips of sleepers muttered âBlasphemy!â One only sighed, remembering a man How like himself, could like so unlike be!â Ha! retro Satanas!âYet how deep he sighed, And in his sleep a name, not sainted, cried. And to the sleepers in their dreams 'twas known A high debate now heralded afar; The church walls widened each way, and a throne Was set on each side, where, like evening star And morning star, each rival glorious Queen Looked on the other, over space between. Ah! but to pen the faces of the twain! The glowing palate should grow blanched and pale, That would attempt such ineffectual pain; And how must words, the tongue's tired drudges, fail To fire the sluggard fancy with the sense Of such love-kindling soft magnificence! Each claimed her empire in the name of Love; This love the Elysium where right lovers dwell; And this the haven of sorrow, spread above, And wide wing-shelter from the hounds of Hell. Innumerable thousands thronged each throne, Claiming the empire for the One alone. And seemed those wondrous faces, as each prayer, Each life lived in their service faithfully, Had brought some added consecration there, And filled them to a fuller deity; As thickening raindrops to the sunlit bow Glory on glory add and glow on glow. Who spake the first? Ev'n she the challenger, The outlawed goddess of the golden day Of Hellas; Aphrodite called they her In syllables so musical to say, That men have loved her for her very name, Before a baser age defiled its fame. Hark with what dropping music she begins, Preluding, as the April nightingale, In shy sweet gusts of song, before she wins Full utterance! For she hath one to assail High-seated, whom no old Olympian vaunt Vanquisheth, nor doth lofty challenge daunt. âGlad is the world and made for happy things, Light hearts and joyous lovers. It is I Who lend the flower its hue, the bird his wings, And to the soul of man its ecstasy.â Lightly she carolled like a happy child. More sober answer made the Mother mild. âSad is the world, full of unhappiness, Death brooding over all. 'Tis I who balm Torn hearts that need a mother's tenderness, And on the seas of shipwreck whisper calm.â Oh, soft, oh, sweet, oh, like a mother's tone! Her rival even did the music own. âThere is a beauty in the hurt made whole, In love that leavens anguish; but the dead Are nothing, and much mourning makes the soul Fade as a ghost, on dead men's manna fed. Live! for the Spring comes yearly, and the rose; And earth is the right heritage of those.â âNay but of others also,â came reply, âThe flower worm-ruined, and the wind-rent leaf; And truth is prospered oft by those that die, And love made yet more beautiful by grief. Who leaves his joy to lighten others' pain, Makes earth more rich than beauty without stain.â âThere,â cried the other, âis our node of strife, If earth be for the happy or the sad. Why should the worthier be the wounded life? If life be good, the best life is the glad. Look how all young things dance for life's delight. The nearer to the source is life more bright.â âAye,â softly said the Mother-maid, âbut see What pangs have brought their joyousness to birth! What cares, what toiling lives uphold their glee! Youth is a day-lived flower upon the earth, And joy a blossom beautiful but brief; Labour the root is, sorrow the green leaf.â âNature hath natural sorrow,â Venus said, âAnd many are the griefs of motherhood; Yet ask of her the happiest newly-wed: Doth she not daily on a new hope brood? The dream of bearing new young happy things Makes her more glad than all that wifehood brings. âThe happiness that from her womb shall grow, The promise of child-creatures made for glee, Enlightens all her heaven with such a glow As spreads before the dawn. How else should she, But for upholding gladness, bear her pain? Her pangs, forsooth, and not her bliss, are gain! âSay that the day is but eclipse of night, And stars unlighted the true lamps of space; That were more reasonable, than delight An outlaw, and this world the rightful place Of griefs and wants and legioned miseries; A house of sweetmeats builded for the flies.â âNay,â Mary said, âthat mother should she bear No straight-limbed manling, but a puny creature, Deformed, dull-witted, giveth she less care Than if perfection lay in every feature? Not this she dreamed of; but a happiness Higher than joy puts out her first distress. âHow dear she loves the child! Yet never he Shall be a grace, a joy, a benediction. The happy heed him not; no childish glee Illumines his long days of slow affliction. Her love more vigour gaineth by vexation; This is the crown, for her, of all creation.â âFor her! for her!â rang out the flute-like scorn. âBut who is she, that for her own self-heal Hurts the good world with her ungainly-born? Who's the wise gardener, he who spares the steel, And lets the wild shoot draw the rose's life, Or he who wields the hoe and pruning-knife? âEach life unlovely keepeth from his own The lawful heir, the goodly half-god man. But grimly the usurper holds the throne, And boldly calls Religion with her ban Nature to bind and Man to terrify With the ten thunder-claps of Sinai. âLook on this man, ugly, deformed and old, Rich from his birth, and nursed to some poor style Of Manhood, coaxed to pleasure, and cajoled To appetite. For him the fairest smile, The strongest labour, and the bravest fight, Who is incapable of all delight. âHow many joyous lives hath he displaced In the compacted press of living things! Abortive beauties that had lived and graced The laughing earth with woven rainbow-rings Of effluent lustre and joy-breeding joy! What worlds of love may one foul life destroy!â âWhat,â cried the Mother, âhath the Man no right To clutch at life, and live as other lives? Life is a thing so feeble and so slight, Saved from the void; a sea-waif that survives A million deaths, and clings where it be able, To spar, or raft, or rocks inhospitable. âThis life extinguished, howso base it be, Who knoweth surely that a new shall rise? Aye, from the basest often may we see The best in due time born. What we despise Is one link in eternity's vast chain; Who knows what hopes its breaking may make vain? âLet man serve man in kindly brotherhood, Reaching wide hands of love to all his kind, The foul, the beautiful, the bad, the good, What is regarding, to what might be blind. Not his to sort or sift, to judge or weigh; He too is in the balance where are they.â âHow then?â as temperately the Queen returned; âWhy has he judgment, if he may not use it? Or knowledge, if it need to be unlearned? Or thirst for beauty, if he may not choose it? Or aspirations for an age ideal, If for the right he may not change the real? âLook you, ye priests, how loudly ye pretend This life is nothing and this world is vain! Why, your own lips condemn you, when ye spend Such labour to preserve these lives of pain, Keeping them from their heritage of bliss. What reason or what charity is this? âHow doth Man weary his dull brains to guess Why in a good world evil so prevails. Here is Doubt's stronghold, here the hardest stress Of Love and Hope; and throned Religion quails, Sick in her heart, lest haply in the end Her good God cannot His own name defend. âAnd lo, it is the very hand of Man That sows the dreadful harvest. Let him heed Wisdom, and work obedient to the plan Whereby creation moves. 'Tis his to breed Reasonably, extinguish the weak strain, Nourish the strong, and give sweet death to pain. âWhy count ye only your now living kind Your neighbours, and the actual generation, Leaving your children's children out of mind, As if in one horizon lay creation? Part of your owing is to them that live, Part to who shall be; weigh the due, and give! âLet Nature, tenderer than your charity, Slay whom she will, and whom she will retain. The wounded bird, the torn-winged butterfly, The stunted flower, the starved unkindly grain, These perish that fair lives be not displaced; Man only keeps the broken and the waste. âSuch might the world be now as ye foretell Hereafter: health and gladness everywhere, And goodness that with gladness loves to dwell. A nobler Adam and an Eve more fair Should walk a Paradise regained, nor find One form less glorious in all mankind. âLet reason-gifted Man use reason right To speed the coming of that crowning kind, Creature of beauty, heir of life's delight, And self-fulfilment of the Eternal Mind, The folded flower from age to age unfurled To the full blossom of a perfect world.â âNay who can judge perfection,â said the other, âHimself imperfect? This is not of Man. The stronger dying for the weaker brother, Unreasonably righteous, helps the plan He understands not, more than did he use His unborn sons for selfishness' excuse. âSee how the dark and cruel world doth now Love darkness less and more leave cruelty, As the light spreads and all the nations bow To the new Altar! Pity and Piety, Like the soft winds of summer, change the face Of earth, and out of weakness groweth grace. âSee in their churches what a comeliness! See in their cities laws how just and good! See in their lives how sweet a gentleness! See in their deaths how high a hardihood! See how wrath dies, and foes are reconciled Kneeling before the Mother and the Child!â âAye!â Venus answered, âfor To-day is thine; The wounded world had need of healing hands. Yet am I sure the Morrow shall be mine, When thy soft law hath leavened all the lands. My kingdom is of joy, and thine of grief; And gladness is eternal, sorrow brief. âAnd pity is but sadness helping sorrow; Sorrow and sadness both shall flee away. What place for pity in the all-bright morrow, More than for lamplight in the risen day? Beauty and love of beauty shall remain, And Aphrodite hold men's hearts again.â What answer had the Mother-maid returned The brethren knew not, for by this the star That heralds morning in the heaven burned, And the first warbler woke. A sudden jar Of earthquake shook the phantom edifice, And all that pageant faded in a trice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">III PRELUDE: AT HURSTMONCEUX Who knows not Hurstmonceux, those russet walls That nestle 'mid green fields where upland falls To fenland, southward facing, now more fair In memory-haunted ruin than when, four-square In ashlar, first they rang with life and noise. The fingering ivy with the turret toys, And loosens brick from brick, and makes the grim Hard outline gracious, breaks the plumb-ruled rim Into such faultless flaws as human art Mars often but makes never. Every part That nameless and soft-handed Power that hides In Nature, but man's question not abides Nor his command obeys, has touched to forms Unmatched, unmeasured, shaped to unknown norms. The roseate ruin lingers like a dream That holds half-waking eyes, still fain to deem The dying vision to be living day; Or sunset cloud ready to pass away; So real it is to sense, to sight so plain, To thought so quickening, and to use so vain. Hither, when oaks new-leafed and fern new-grown Filled earth with scents of Eden, and full-blown The bluebells lay (like robes from Heaven flung To fit a beggar-maid for place among Queens at high banquet), came these friends again, A-foot, by field-path and green-mantled lane. Across the grassy levels many a mile They wandered, leaped the ditch and climbed the stile; Where in wide leasowes, like the fields of heaven, Feed flocks and herds like those of old time driven By conquerors across a conquered land, Or creatures of the prairie, band on band, Unnumbered, swallowed in the dream of space. So wide the earth is, and so vast the face, Milky, pearl-lucent of the peaceful sky; So low the green world and the blue so high; So all forgotten is the noise of man And grime of cities; so immense the span Of emptiness above; that thought lets go Her anchorage awhile, and to and fro Wavers in buoyant, new, unstrained delight, And with strange wonder takes each common sight. But when at last, with travel-weary feet, They reached the rising land and hedgerows sweet With honeysuckle, and came unto their end, And saw the ruin, saw the road descend To moat and gateway: âHere,â one cried, âwe stay, And rest and feed and dream an hour away, Removed a little from the sight-seÃ«rs; For here is scented fern and golden furze, And turf for seat or table; and outspread Before us, like a pageant of the dead, The unseen ghosts on that yet real stage Shall act again their parts from age to age.â Ah, what delight more joyous than, between Dull days of labour, in some blissful scene, With friends close-bound by many sympathies, To give the wand to fancy, and see rise Touched by romance the old dry bones of story, Like spiritual bodies seen in glory! Ev'n thus these friends re-pictured ancient days, Each adding his self-touch, in divers ways, And many divers colours. âOh, for me,â Cried one, âlet History fancy-tinted be, And dreamlike as a distant landscape, veiled The sordid motive, and the dark deed paled! This is the dearest whiteness on Time's brow To dote on: Then and thus men laboured, now May we, their children, without labour share The joy of labour, without battle bear The glory of battle. O rich heritage! O priceless history! O golden page! Elysian rest, down-looking on the world; Gladness of truce, when for a moment furled Our forward banners stand, the incessant fray Forgotten, striving limbs no more at bay. O dreamlike pageant! CÃ¦sar's blood is shed As in our sight, and yet the earth not red; Francesca wrongly loves, yet does no wrong; Paul is thrice scourged, and no flesh feels the thong; Buddha his body to the tigress gives, And still with untorn body Buddha lives. So in yon walls was many an evil way, In yon green woodlands many a wild affray; Here was the red hand harboured, and the crime Allowed full oft; until at last the time Ripened to murder in the woods, and he, The high young lord, was hanged on Tyburn tree. All this was done; yet here peace broods for us, And all the place unmindful, slumberous, And innocent abides, as here had stood The cloister of some holiest brotherhood.â âYet,â said another, âcan we surely know Which seed is fruitful? Does the deed of woe, Lust, murder, vengeance, like the doer die, Or break in other semblance presently? For oft it has been told or sung in verse That on this house or that there hangs a curse; And well it may be that a wicked deed Soweth from heart to heart such evil seed As flowers from age to age and dieth ne'er, Though crime change fashion and new feature wear. What if a madness haunted yon proud halls Prompting to evil act? Who but recalls That direful wreaking of a woman's spleen That wrecked their splendour? Came it of the tene Of ancient time, because in this fair glade Rage was familiar, madness common made?â âNay, why explain by ought but nature's chance,â One answered him, âa woman's petulance? Two thousand years ago a poet knew What deeds a woman in mad mood will do. Her will is as the wind, stormy or soft, In calm how soothing! aye, and strenuous oft For great and happy purpose. Yet what ship, Trusting the wind alone, with no stern grip Of stark hand on stout rudder, should escape Shipwreck on reef or rock or jutting cape?â âHere,â cried the poet, âhave I yet for you, All pat to purpose, an old tale made new, A little gold thing from that monkish mine, Which I have set about and sought make fine With jewels stolen from old Homer's store, In his hand gloriousâah, in mine how poor!â CHRYSEIS She stood, a captive, in the conqueror's tent, Weeping. The great lord Agamemnon bent His low'ring eyes upon her loveliness, And felt some long-forgotten tenderness Rise in his breast. The heart, that had not beat Long time for any passion save the heat Of royal anger, or the fierce wild joys Of battle, throbbed again as doth a boy's In his first love-dream. At himself amazed, In a long silence on the girl he gazed, Doubting if he, the lord of war, might yield To the sweet influence; but while he steeledâ Or thought to steelâhis breast, her large dark eyes She lifted, soft with sorrow, in such wise As a tame creature hunted, who not yet Has learnt she might be tortured. And their wet Shy lashes, and their pitiful deep gleams, Changed in a moment all his world. His dreams, Ambitions, faded from him. As a soul Stands in the dead-world, stripped clean of its whole Life's clothing, worn desire and soiled delight, And faces a new Orient: so the might Of Agamemnon saw new heaven and earth In one look of a girl's eyes leap to birth. He spake not; but the signs of love she knew,â What woman knows not?âand a brighter hue Stole to her cheek, as hope came back, and pride. Her drooping head was raised, her tears were dried; Ev'n as the rain-bowed lily after rain Shakes off the drops, and lifts her face again To watch for sunbeams: so Chryseis stood Before the stern dark face in its soft mood; Then spake with liquid low untroubled tone: âMagnanimous Atrides! If alone On thee my fate hangs now, what need of prayer? Thy noble heart shall prompt thee, lord, to spare The lowly creature that to thee is nought, Yet much to those that mourn her. 'Tis thy thought, Haply, that cheap to thee is cheap to all. Nayânot the lightest forest-leaf can fall But leaves its little void. Let me go back To them whose large gain means how small a lack To thee, Lord Agamemnon!â So she prayed; But he, who listened, not the meaning weighed Of her girl talk, but her delicious tone Drank as the very echo of Love's own. âGift of the Gods! Fear not thy lofty fate! Not thus the Immortals dower when they hate; Nor here of their own handiwork are they Grown jealous (this too has been!) since to-day They crown their gift of beauty with this prize, The love of Agamemnon. In thine eyes I find again an old forgotten dream, A joy desirable above the gleam And dusty glory of a conqueror's name. Therefore lift up thy head, to wear the fame Of Agamemnon as thy worthy crown, The day when Clytemnestra is cast down (The adulteress, so they whisper) and her sway And all these evil days put clean away!â No pleading lover this, but as a god Imperious in kindness, whose least nod Stirs storm or fire or earthquake, ungainsayed. And in a dumb amazement stood the maid, Listening the low grave thunders of his speech. The words fell as great waves fall on a beach, When a tempestuous day has died serene, And the full waves fall thunderous; but between Are silences that mark the measured beat Of a great music. She knew well the sweet Petulant importunities, the soft Unmeaning words of lovers, listened oft By every maiden on the lengthening eves, When nightingales sing love's name to the leaves. How all unlike that low-voiced love was this Half-awful wooing! Yet an unknown bliss Grew round her heart, and on his face she stole A shy fleet glance; and wonder held her soul If Zeus himself, within his golden cloud, Were nobler, more majestic, broader-browed. So every impulse, that stirs woman's heart To love, now moved her, one alone apart. And had the calm of power sat less serene Upon his brow, and had his utterance been But once half-broken by one pleading toneâ One touch to show that great heart mateless, lone, A desolation 'neath its mask of pride: Then Pity, Love's half-sister, had thrown wide Her heart's half-opened gates, and Love rushed in. (So easy 'tis a woman's love to win!) But, pity wanting, all the rest was vain; And with herself she warred to let disdain Of his despotic speech and high self-praise Master the awe, the gladness, the amaze, That stayed her speech and stirred her heart within. (So hard it is a woman's love to win!) So to the great king made the girl reply: âWhat, am I Helen? or think you to vie With Paris in light loving? As he left Forlorn Ãnone, will you thus with deft Excuse leave Clytemnestra? In this thing Wiser, that not the darling of a king But a weak girl you cozen, whom no war Shall follow, nor a nine-year siege pay for. Mighty is Agamemnon, but the maid Of Troas not by sounding names is swayed, Nor lets love follow fancy, as the Greek, Light, lovely and lascivious; nor is meek To any man who holds before her eyes His own proud name as her most glorious prize. With us, forsooth, are heroes not so rare, Nor all too numerous are maidens fair! Talk Agamemnon in some prouder ear, And leave Chryseis to her lowly sphere!â Lovely she looked, in the defiant pride Of beauty; and her half-feigned furies hide For himâunused to woman's waysâher heart, That half reproved, half urged her to the part She played, too tragical to be all true. For as one in a whirlpool caught, she knew Of vague great conflict round her, but discerned No clear decision, nor what fortunes turned For what dim multitudes upon the act Of her unweighted girlishness, compact Of light desires and little straws of will, And not one master purpose good or ill. Lovely she looked, and Agamemnon smiled Indulgently as on an angry child. âGirl, I am Agamemnon. Woman's tongue Can wound me not, nor taunts at random flung. Not yours to speed the issue or delay!â And smiling still, unmoved, he turned away. His love had moved her not to love or hate; His anger might have moved her love, had fate So willed it; but his smiling untouched calm Stung her to fury. Speechless, with clenched palm, She stood, her words of anger and disdain, A woman's armoury, spent all in vain. In a white stillness, like a shape of rare Cold marble, she stood solitary there. But not within were cold or calm; a fire Scorched all her soul, one passionate desire To sting some way that steeled heroic heart. This thought and that she tried, nor let depart Unscrutinised the grisliest shapes of harm, Witchcraft and bloody murder, heathen charm And hellish potion that drives reason out. But as her pulse beat calmer, the red rout Of horrible revenges, fading, left Clearer her purpose, and her wit more deft. And using woman's subtle ways, she sent A secret message, by a ship that went On other purpose, to Apollo's priest, Chryses, her father,âmight she be released By ransom. And the old man rose and came, Gifts in his hand, and made his high heart tame; And humbly to the proud AchÅans prayed, And most to the twin chieftains, that the maid Might be restored; and shewed the ransom meant. Then all the Argives' voice was to consent, Save only Agamemnon's; but the king Thrust him away and spake a cruel thing: âLook to it that I find thee not again Loitering by the ships, old priest, or vain For thy defence shall all thy priest-gear be, Nor shall thy holy office shelter thee From Agamemnon's anger. She is mine, And shall be; nor for prayer or gift of thine Will I release her, ere her head grow grey Beside my hearth in Argos far away.â Heavy with grief, and dread, and bitter wrath, From the king's presence went the old man forth; And slow, with leaden feet that slurred the sand, Passed from the busy ship-staith, till the strand Curved round a rocky point, that hid the bay And the black boat-hulls; and before him lay A lonely beach, a wide and lonely sea. Then his grey head he lifted, breathing free, And raised his white-robed arms to heaven, and prayed To great Apollo whom he served; and said: âHear me, Apollo, who with sovran pride Chryse and holy Cilla dost bestride, And over western Tenedos ev'n now Majestically lift'st thy royal brow! Look, Lord, on all the service of thy priest, The temples raised, and blood of many a beast! Look now on his dishonour, hear his cry, And rain thy vengeance on the Danai!â So spake the priest, full-facing to the West, Where the great Sun-god stood above the breast Of the broad waters. And behold a sign Followed the prayer! For, lo, as line on line, Like even ridges in a long plough-land, The marching waves rolled in upon the sand, The reddening sunlight from the verge began To touch each crest, till seemed a ladder ran Right down the waters, and with glowing feet The golden god himself stepped down to meet His minister, and presently declare The swift and terrible answer to his prayer. Then with a vengeful gladness in his heart Homeward he went, the priest, and watched apart For news of evil in the Grecian camp. Nor did the god forget. No armÃ¨d tramp Nor warlike trumpet tells when gods attack. Silently the host sickened, for a black Horrible plague broke out on beasts and men, And day and night the death-fires burnt. But when For nine full days had grown the deadly bale, And ever more the people's hearts 'gan fail; Nor ever Agamemnon spake a word, The looked-to leader, for within him stirred A doubtful dim foreboding; then at last Arose Achilles, and his heralds passed Through all the host, with summons to debate. And Agamemnon heard; and knew dark fate Nearer and nearer pressing, like the net When hunters trap a lion; but not yet Discerned he the decreed resistless end. What! had one weak girl-captive force to bend The fates 'gainst Agamemnon? 'Twas a thingâ A thoughtâenvenomed as a gadfly's sting, But lightly brushed aside. And yet the hour Called him, lest even now the kingly power Pass from him. For another's voice ev'n then, Not his, had called the council; and to men Stricken and strong in numbers, a king's name Weighed light.âThe shadow of a coming shame Fell on him, and with fierce resolve he bade Summon Chryseis. And she came, the maid, Slight in her girlhood, lovely in her youth; A thing to be crushed lightly, save for ruth; A flower to be trod under, save for grace; A cage-bird to be spared a little space For song's sake or bright feathersâsuch she seemed; And briefly the king spake, for still he deemedâ Being in his power to spare her or to killâ That one strong word would fright her to his will: âGirl, 'tis no time for follies that girls use; The hour is stern, and brief the time to choose. Content thee to be Agamemnon's bride, For so the god will put his wrath aside!â As to a slave he spoke, imperiously; And like one startled from a dream stood she. For, once her vengeance sure, her mind had turned Back to soft thoughts; and in her memory burned His kingliness, his godlike looks, his tone Of world-dominion.âThere are deeps unknown In all girl-hearts, where of slight things is wove In secret the first nameless shape of Love. And all the nine days past her dreams had been Of him, so royal a lover, by the tene Her hands had brought upon him, turned to crave For pity and for love of her his slave; And rainbow-bright had been her dreams beyond Of love and splendour. Day by day with fond And disappointed eyes she looked for him; But when he came, more stern, more hard, more grim, And spake with curt command his âBe content!â A sudden anger changed her soft intent. âNay, I am in thy power for good or ill! But not thy power can move a maiden's will To love the bed she loathes, or count her shame Well cloaked behind a warrior's bloody fame. Truly to him, who for fair wind and wave To vengeful gods his very daughter gave, Light seems a maiden-sacrifice. Arise, And slay me, while the blood is in thine eyes, If so Apollo may be won to spare Some lean remains of Argives here and there!â As a keen bowman from his well-strung bow Lets fly his shafts to lay some hero low, Choosing him in the press; and tries in vain, For through the mail no arrow may attain; At last some fissure finds the stubborn steel, And with a sudden death he sees him reel; So, trying many taunts, the girl's light tongue At last that great heroic heart had stung. âGirl, girl, you know not what you say!â he cried, And turned him from her eyes his hurt to hide. But she with swift repentance, woman-like, And half afraidâas one unused to strikeâ At her own doing, and half pitying, Gazed on the bowed head of the great grim king. And had he then but raised his troubled eyes, The sorrow in them yet without disguise, And so met hers where yet the pity lay, Had been another ending of that day. Not so 'twas written. Just one step she made Towards him; but, ere her light touch was laid Upon his shoulder, lo, in the tent door Talthybius stood, the messenger, who bore Word to the kingâthe leaders all were met Already, and the council duly set. And as he heard him, knew the king the weight Of a dark urgent hour, and pressing Fate. And from the tent he passed, nor turned his head Once where the girl stood gazing. A great dread Lay heavy on his soul. Like one he seemed, A swimmer, who with practised limbs has deemed 'Twere light to reach the shore whene'er he would, But making thither finds his force withstood; Some soft resistless current thwarts his toil, And bears him, in full sight of the fair soil, Irrevocably to a sunless deep. Or as a dreamer, striving in his sleep, Who, striving ever, never nears the goal: So Agamemnon felt, with raging soul, Despised things grown resistless: a priest's prayer, A slave-girl's mood-by these things he must bear, He, Agamemnon, to be turned aside From his determined path! A flame of pride Flared in him: if to gods he needs must bow, Let men look to it how they thwart him now! So, like a black cloud in whose bosom burn The boding lightnings, strode he grim and stern Beside the ship-staith, where the heroes wait. And first Achilles spake and 'gan debate. âGreat Agamemnon, if now sickness crave And war as well its tithing, what can save? Better, ere all shall perish, to enquire Of seer or soothsayer, for what the ire Of Lord Apollo burns so balefully, And for what offering he will lay it by.â So spake the king; but Agamemnon still Kept silence, knowing in his heart the will Of Heaven, and raging 'gainst the gathering doom. And the host watched him, as men watch the gloom When the low mutter 'mid the hills grows loud, And black as midnight climbs the thunder-cloud. Then rose, with bright eyes watching the king's frown, And pale as one who trembles to call down The sudden lightning, Calchas, the skilled seer, To whom what is, was, shall be, all was clear; And through dark seas and dangerous days he led, By dexterous divination piloted, All the right way to Troy the Grecian ships. But now he spoke with less assurÃ¨d lips: âAchilles, all thou askest I can tell, And why Apollo's fury is so fell. Yet swear thou to defend me, since belike One shall I anger, who hath power to strike This day, or when he will, a meaner man. Ill luck it is to lie 'neath kingly ban.â Then proudly spake Achilles: âBe this arm Thy bulwark 'gainst whoe'er would do thee harm, Aye, were it Agamemnon!â Then the seer Spake confidently, putting off his fear: âLo, he who troubles Argosâeven he, King Agamemnon! who refused to free The damsel, the priest's daughter; and reviled With cruel words the priest who craved his child. For this Apollo's wrath is fall'n on you; Nor will he turn therefrom until the due Amend be madeâthe girl unransomed given, And hecatombs arise in smoke to Heaven.â He spake, and all might see the deepening night On Agamemnon's brow. He rose upright, Black as a storm-cloud; from his eyes a flame Flashed on the cowed seer; and the thunder came. âThou evil prophet! Never hadst thou yet Fair sooth for me. Thy heart is ever set On bitter bodings, nor one happy thing Hast thou e'er said or compassed for the king. And now thou dar'st to use a great god's name To do despite to Agamemnon's fame, And filch his lawful portion, the fair slave Whom to their king the Argive voices gave. Be it so! Yet not so weak a king am I To see this insult, sitting tamely by. Look! There were other girl-slaves in the prey, To others portioned! Let who will gainsay, One will I send for, whom I choose, of those.â He spake; and with fierce eyes Achilles rose: âAh, clothed in shamelessness, thou usurer king! How shall AchÅans bear thy captaining In wayfare or in warfare any more? No grudge against these men of Troy I bore; Mine ox they had not stolen nor my steed, Nor harried lands of mine; too wide indeed Between us the dark skies and dangerous seas. Thee came we all this weary way to please. Therefore will I the way I came return, Nor spend dishonoured days thy wealth to earn!â As in the desert ways the lion's lair Is unmolested, for no creature dare Challenge or chance his wrath; until some day Haply another lion come that way: So looked the two kings in each other's eyes, Equals in anger; and Atrides cries, âAway then, if thou wilt! No word from me Shall stay thee! I have surer friends than thee And wiser counsellors. Thy joy of heart Is but in battle, and thine only art Untutored turbulence to friend or foe. Strong though thou be, 'tis God that made thee so, Not thine own arm or brain!âI tell thee then, Away with thee! Call off thy ships, thy men! Rule thine own Myrmidons, that brook thy rule! Hear this beside, thy lofty heart to school! Ev'n as Apollo claims this maid from me, So will I, Agamemnon, take from thee Thy maiden. This, to tame that pride of thine, Nor let another match his might with mine!â As a keen sword-stroke dealt in the last stress, When foemen, weary of fencing, fiercely press In deadliest onset: so the king's high speech Had some insistent hatred that could reach The heart of the adversary. And he, who sings In antique simpleness this wrath of kings, Tells how Achilles' mind was instantly To draw the vengeful steel and bid him die; Had not AthenÃ¨ with unseen control His impulse swayed, and soothed his angry soul. To us the story tells of that old might Of kingliness we mock at and think slight In these unkingly days; that yet had force So godlike in strong will and strenuous course, That ev'n Achilles, that renownÃ¨d name, Before king Agamemnon proved so tame. Then Nestor rose, the ancient calm old man, Whose long full life had passed the human span, Whose voice was as the voice of judgment-days Far-off, eternal, passionlessâthe phrase Of grave historian or philosopher, Who lets to-morrow's light on this day's stir. He now with quiet words assuaged their ire; Nor yet did more than one who stays a fire Among the heaths and grasses of a plain, But leaves a smoulder that shall blaze again. Yet for the present was the strife composed, And that undying rancour lightly glosed. And the assembly to their tents went back, Hoping the end might be of days so black; When Agamemnon had the maid released, Surely the angry god and vengeful priest Should stay the pestilence! And now a fleet Black ship lay ready; and the unresting feet Of swift decorous heralds hotly went To bring the maiden from the royal tent. There came no brightness in her faceâher breast Heaved with no sudden gladness. She had guessedâ No word yet saidâthe very tale they bore. Her seemed she dreamed of things done long before, And moved resistless in a dreamer's way. For in her heart one moment 'twas to say Take me to Agamemnon! but her tongue Helped her not, nor her hands helped, when she clung, (Did she not cling?) resistful, to the tent. And slowly, like a sleep-walker, she went Following to the ship-staith and the ship. She heard the signalâsaw the brown hands grip The smooth-worn ashen oars, the white foam churned In bubbling whirlpools, as the long keel spurned The grooved sand and leapt out to meet the wave. That tore her heart out: one low cry she gave, Heard not amid the creak of oars, the crash Of smiting oar-blades and the water's dash. Then rising, turning, to the land she setâ The flying landâher face, if haply yet One lordly lonely man she might discern Last lingering of the gazers. Ah, too stern, (Her heart knew well) too stern, too proud, too great He, for the void regrets 'twixt love and hate! He watched not, as some weaker lover might, Half wistfully the dwindling sails of white, Giving one hour to dreams of might-have-been. Empty her eyes returned; and wide between Now grew the waters, misty the low land, Dreamlike the blue hills and the shining sand. Now has she missed her life's immortal hour In one light moment. As a splendid flower, Whose bearing was her birthright, whose rich fruit Ripening had blessed the world in years yet mute, And spread to distant lands a golden seed, It died unblossomed through her petulant deed. A great fear fell on her, and boding dire Of blood and infinite wailing and black fire. Her soul in its tense agony took on A prophet prescience; visions waste and wan Arose and vanished. In a swoon of fears She lay, with dreadful music in her ears. Yet no clear shape she saw of coming doom, The sequence of her deeds; and knew not whom, Trojan or Greek, she feared for. Not the rout Of Argives, nor Patroclus' death, the shout That shook the Ilian plain, nor Hector drawn, Nor Priam's praying hands, nor that red dawn Of fire upon the rocking walls of Troyâ Not these clear sorrows saw she; nor the joy Of the victorious, and her lover-king Lord of the triumph; nor the last worst thing, The adulterous queen, the snaky paramour, The treacherous welcome at the palace door, The bath, the horrible net, the murderess wife At work with the brute axe, the ebbing life Of that great lord of lions, dying so, Not as a king, facing some glorious foe, But shamefully, a naked man, by hands A coward's and a woman's. Ah, what brands Are lighted at one little flame, that she, Who lightly kindled it, shall never see! Therefore because to women the clear sight Not oft is giv'n, to follow wrong and right From one small-seeming moment in their great Irrevocable sequence; at each gate Of perilous decision God has set Love for the guide and guard; nor ever yet One woman, how-so weak, unreasonable, Took noble Love for guide, but has been able, Spite of all doubtful turns and crossing ways, To tread true paths, and live out righteous days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IV PRELUDE: ON FIRLE BEACON Fair are the hills of Sussex, low and long, And softly rounded as a mother's arm About a cradle, dimpled, naked, strong; A fence against the fear of some dim harm, Earthquake, or tide, or terror from the sea, Darkly foretold, none knoweth when to be. They are a border-land, a several realm, A refuge yet of outlawed deities, Old simple gods, haunters of beech and elm, Yew-shaded hollows, hidden cavities Where the horse treads not; heathen gods forlorn, Houseless, unfeared, unworshipped, all men's scorn. They are a wonderland, where shapes well-known, Hayrick or homestead, bush or tree-top, seen Far off, take forms of faerie not their own; Where viewless things, half-human, lurk between The beechwood stems, or on some lonely spur Hide in the sparse low-growing juniper. Abiding peace is on them. Like the calm Cold monument in a cathedral aisle That keeps some great one's likeness; and the psalm Rolls daily o'er the head, and like a smile The sunlight falls upon the carven brow, And peace for ever is his portion now; So a memorial of diviner mould Are these to Time himself, that ancient Time That died or ever this, that we call old, Rose fresh and young in his forgotten prime; The lark-song is their anthem, and the drone Of unseen insect-wings an organ-tone. Many a grassy path lies o'er the down To lead the rare-seen wayfarer from farm To lonely farm, from town to little town, By stony hollows where in quick alarm The coneys rush to refuge, and o'er crests Green, gentle-rising, where the lapwing nests. 'Twas August, hot and cloudless; a light haze Dreamed over land and sea; when forth they set, That little company, by chalk-white ways To gain that high, long-fronted parapet Whose dominance looks down on Firle, and frowns Across to Caburn and the Lewes Downs. They wandered long in that high-lifted world, The far-off sea to left-hand, and to right The wide weald far beneath, a map unfurled, Dark woods, and golden fields, and emerald light A jewel-gleam on tree or hill or mead, The prick of revelation dull eyes need. Till, coming to the Beacon-top, they stayed, And on the sun-warmed turf at ease reclining Gazed in long silence on the landscape laid (As if just for their joy was its designing) In lavish feast before them, all their own, As a boy's vision of an offered throne. Till presently: âLo, there Newhaven lies,â One said, âand Lewes there!âââNay, break not so The spell!â came soft reproof from one more wise. âIn such an hour 'tis richer not to know, But to let Fancy like a falcon soar, And for herself the wonder-world explore. âThe golden-streeted port, the castled steep, The haunted hollows and far hills forlorn, Let us in dreamland for one hour keep! Let Now be Then, Here Yonder, Joy unworn! We blind our eyes by seeking overmuch Content of poorer senses, taste or touch.â âOh,â cried another,â for the eyes to see Earth as she lieth in the lap of Heaven, All miracle, all Eden! view her free From Man, from Mind, that worketh as a leaven To change her nature, so that use and grace All perish save to make Man's dwelling-place. âAs some fair church forsaken, where a brood Of bats have entered, everything defiling, And made foul nests in altar-cloth or rood, And marred the rich mosaic and rare tiling; The carven tomb or jewelled shrine provides Fit place to feed or breedâwhat use besides? âSo taketh Man this temple marvellous, With splendour decked, enriched by heavenly art, Where angels and archangels numerous Have laboured with such love that every part Doth its due service to the One Divine, Each stone an altar, every tree a shrine; âAnd uses Earth so ignorantly ill As doth no creature else; her beauty scars, Her working changes by his woeful skill; No fairest spot he visits but he mars, No live thing seeth but he seeks to slay, No pure thing but defiles; this is his way. âAnd we, who would, can see not for the blindness Of use, and long-sealed eyes, and wonted words; Save at rare moments when Heav'n's loving-kindness Shows us the earth of flowers and beasts and birds, Revealing, for our heart-sick nature's cure, Beauty the one thing holy, righteous, pure.â Another took in turn the word: âThey gain Much but lose more, who, ever seeking cause, Pass semblance over, and while they explain With keen analysis all Nature's laws, No eyes have for the simple revelation, The mystic light that streams from all creation. âTherefore no more doth Art steal heavenly fire; Statue and high-roofed temple take no more The touch divine; nor gleam nor dream inspire The painter; while man's spirit, loth to soar, Prisoner herself, her fellow-prisoner calls Only to gild her chain and deck her prison-walls.â Answered the gentle voice of youth and joy: âDespair not thus! For Time is justified, As Wisdom, of his children. Let Hope buoy On waiting wings till the returning tide! Tend we the tree of knowledge, leaf and root! Who knows how fair our sons shall find the fruit? âWe see not; but 'tis something men have seen Through opened gates a glory not of Man; We soar not; but we know that there have been Winged spirits, and we claim us of their clan. The seed they left us, though it slumber long, Shall yet break out in statue, picture, song. âMan of himself can nothing make of beauty; This gift God keepeth at His own award; With labour man can compass law and duty, But loveliness is largesse of the Lord; Though for long years the oracles be dumb, Know surely there is yet a seer to come!â Awhile was silence. Then the Poet spake: âLo, here a story kindred to our theme, A pleasant tale, which whoso will may take For parable, how every highest dream And every perfect work is from above, And comes to man unearned, the gift of Love.â THE STATUE I This too was written as a tale of old On those sere wrinkled leaves in artless phrase. Among the Grecian Histories 'tis told How once a sculptor of the golden days Won fame by infamy and life by death, Though now his name no man remembereth. A wind of piety upon a time Blew through the Westward Isles, and temples rose Like flowers in every city. 'Twas the prime Of glorious Art; and never such as those Before were seen, nor after shall be wrought Dwellings with such divinity o'erfraught. By trailing ropes some gained the ruinous deck, And downward to her bowels made their way. There, dead or sleeping, careless of the wreck, In the dim inmost twilight one man lay, Sleeping or dead; and overshadowing him The freight, a marble mass, rough-hewn and grim. There was none else, no living thing nor dead, Nor other burden in the empty darkness; The ribs re-echoed hollow to their tread; Their eyes found nothing but that marble starkness. Yet breathing seemed the man; and near him stood A shrunken wine-skin and the crusts of food. Him to the upper light they bore; and soon Fanned by the freshness he awoke and sighed, And stared, as one that struggles out of swoon, On the strange faces round; and then more wide Wandered his glance about that unknown bight, The cliffs, the town, the temple on the height. Which when he saw, a sudden eagerness Lit up the leaden dimness of his gaze; And half he rose. And then a quick distress Smote him as one remembering old dismays; And a hoarse question broke from his wan lip: âThe marble, is it whole within the ship?â Nor with reply contented, soon he rose And feebly back returned where he was found, And the great marble in its grey repose With anxious fingers felt and fumbled round, And stooped and pried in that wan-lighted place, And searched it everywhere from crown to base. But when his eyes and hands were satisfied That all unriven and flawless lay his treasure, Back to the upper air he climbed, and cried Strange thanksgiving in a rhapsodic measure, Facing the shining temple on the shore, With palms raised flatwise to the blue heaven o'er: âDear Lady, sweet on land and strong on sea, Making life gladness, keeping death at bay! Behold again thy servant offers thee His service to the utmost for no pay. The power is thine, the eye, the hand, the brain; Breathe on him till he make thee breathe again!â Then mightily, as one refreshed with wine, He stretched himself and lightly leapt on land, And swiftly mounted to the pillared shrine, And laughed glad-hearted laughter, seeing it stand In flawless beauty, yet untenanted, With fireless altar and bare statue-bed. By this the tidings of the shipwrecked man In gathering wonder went about the town; But while the rumour through the market ran, A livelier interest beat the murmur down; For round the head that hid the distant blue The long-awaited ship to haven drew. Then every street was emptied, house and stall Lay open to the pilferer, none to care; While, like a slipping hillside, one and all The gathering townsfolk to the harbour fare To greet the coming goddess, who should bless Their temple with her crowning loveliness. How changed were their glad faces, when the tale Ran through the throng, that all their hope destroyed; The night-long labouring in the deadly gale, And jaws of death too instant to avoid Save the too heavy burden of her womb The good ship yielded to the yawning doom. Then were there tears and anger, questioning And blaming, random and unreasonable; Till, vexed by the intolerable sting Of disappointment, the impetuous rabble Cried for the blood of those in trust, who dared Let slip their treasure, and their own lives spared. Already flew the stone and flashed the steel, The tools of haste and fury, when a shout, Sharp as a trumpet, turned them head and heel To see who shouted. On the wall without Stark as a statue, lo, the stranger stood, And swayed with Hermes' urgence their mad mood. âBeware! Be warned! Madmen! Behold the hand Of Heaven, a sign of favour to your isle! Servant of Aphrodite, here I stand, Announcing that within a little while In yonder temple will she take the throne In fairer likeness than the world hath known. âTell ye whose eyes have seen her, how she sleeps In marble cerements! How the tempest boreâ When the false image weltered to the deepsâ The veritable goddess safe to shore! There without form she sleepeth in the stone; This hand hath she ordained to make her known.â As one inspired he spake. The light-moved mob Tamed to his master-words, and to the strand All followed. Then, with many a laboured sob And muscle-crack, went up the heavy sand, And by the stony stairway of the street, The marble, on an hundred human feet. And ever that imperious man's command Became the free-will of the multitude. As when a god unseen goes through the land, And strong religion changes all the lewd, A wave of impulse carried all who heard In swift obedience to the stranger's word. So, none forbidding, to the temple gate They came; and, none forbidding, onward bore Up the broad marble steps the massy weight; And, still no man forbidding, passed the door And entered the white echoing empty hall, And heavily raised it on the pedestal. Then came the times of Saturn to the isle, Light winds, soft sunshine, gentle, kindly rain; No strife of neighbours, no sea-robber's guile; Large were the clusters, plump the bounteous grain. And ever in the temple on the height Toiled the strange sculptor and the chips lay white. And one who, hid in shadow, watched his toil Told with what nimble ease his fingers wrought. He seemed as one who breaks the clayey coil Round a cast image, rather than with thought And patient finger-touches of fine skill To fashion formless marble to his will. Like racing clouds the shining hours went by, The happy day, the never dreadful night; And lo, the work was ended, and the cry Rang through the isle to call men to the sight; And to the feast from hamlet and seaport The whole world came with revelry and sport. Sweet were the garlands, rich the incense smoke, Bright every garment, all lips curved with laughter, Until amid the mist the white shape broke Upon their eyes, and a great hush came after; As after earthquake all men's faces change, And our own voices suddenly seem strange. There was no lightest-hearted that could look Not reverently upon that face divine; The jest died on the lip; the gay glance took A sudden soberness; all eyes 'gan shine With the high gladness of a poet's hour Who hears within his soul some word of power. There was no speaking; but a murmur went, Like winds on moorlands, through the thronging hall; One look was on all faces; one intent, One inspiration in the hearts of all. To every man that marble silence seems A new religion nobler than his dreams. Long was the orgasm of that ecstasy, Ere silently by one and one the crowd Departed from the temple. Lo, the sky, The green land, the wide sea, each little cloud, Seemed changedâa book, long uninterpreted, Now clearly in the ears of all men read. Quick through the neighbour islands ran the tale, And drew a thousand strangers o'er the sea. More quick did proud vaingloriousness prevail Above that first pure flame of piety; And, like a beggar summoned to a crown, The island flaunted in her new renown. But ever with them in much honour held Continued he who wrought their marble pride, A silent presence, with deep eyes that quelled Enquiry and near fellowship denied. And the glad days went like a spendthrift's wealth, Uncounted happiness and careless health. II What is this crying on the summer air? What is this tumult? Who, ah, who is he The furious rabble with fierce faces bearâ Tossing and beating like an angry seaâ To what wild doom? We know those dÅdal eyes! 'Tis he, the sculptor, in what haggard guise! With clamour and with curses and with blows They brought him bleeding to the judgment-seat. He looked: he saw no faces but of foes; Then, rising hardly, stood upon his feet, And beckoning in the old imperious way, Made sudden silence while he said his say. âO friends, whose fury is more kind than love, If ye hate hear me, if ye love me, kill! For none more guilty breathes the air above; And save ye slay me outright, torture still Must wait on torment, and my tongue be made, Forced to confession, a self-murdering blade.â Like the night-screaming wind that whirls the dead To icy hells, so wailed the bleak despair In that wild voice, nor one knew what was said; Yet each sharp syllable that stabbed the air Stung to the naked heart; and when he stilled, An awful silence the thronged faces filled. Therefore, beholding wished-for death delay, And keen blades sheathing offer hope no more, He turned him, as a wild thing turns to bay, To face the unseen Furies, urging sore; And rending his own heartstrings, uttered loud His agonies to the awe-stricken crowd. âThere was a man enamoured from his birth Of gracious outlines, curve of moulded limbs, Wood-slope on river-cliff, snow-muffled earth, Bosomy clouds, soft hills, and pencilled rims Of low horizons, and the maidenly Long arms of witch-elms on the winter sky. âAnd ere his lips knew letters, he could shape With infant fingers creatures of the clay; And, learning by his labour, sought to ape The human face and form in childish play; Then, early come to manhood, knew the whole Of his rich birthright and the sculptor's soul. âI do remember well that hour's delight When first with chisel-tooth I touched the skin Of satin-surfaced marble, smooth and white, Dreaming to find the dream that slept within; The quick surprise, the joy of power, the feel Of that soft hardness giving to the steel. âAlas, how many a time I flung afar My chisel, like a mutinous mage-wand That would not work my will, and did but mar The shape my eye saw through the marble bond; Yet, to the task returning, ever wrought Little by little nearer to my thought. âYet, past success conception still would soar, As o'er the heron climbing climbs the hawk. What mattered that men praised me more and more? The beauty of beauties still my hand did balk. Though each new effort half the distance gained, Still by the half the goal lay unattained. âAye, like the flowing and the ebbing tide, Art touched its topmost, and despair returned, Again and yet again; and for no pride Could I forget the dream to which I yearned: A marble womanhood whose nakedness Were more religious than a vestal's dress. âAlas, one loved me, and I loved herâshe Beyond the world, I only next my art. Once in a woeful day she came on me Eating despair, and from my bitter heart With softly-worded whispers won the tale Of that dark Hell of artist soulsâTo Fail. âShe stilled to sudden whiteness; but her eyes Burned with a raptured fire; and when that hush Was ended, and with wild and weakling cries I cursed myself for fool, a new rare blush Mounted on her wan cheek; and she 'gan thrill me, Putting her hand upon my lips to still me. âShe spake: âI too have dreamed, and in my dreaming Foreseen a coming glory to be won For me and thee together. For earth's teeming Is ever of the twain and not the one; And for thine art's perfection needs a soul Wedded and welded in a perfect whole. ââO unwise sculptor, who for love's desire Bade deathless marble mortal woman be, And beauty melt as snow before love's fire, And art fall basely from her great degree! For her hath Death long swallowed, and he is dead, And earth the poorer for that wife ill-wed. ââBut thou with me consider, could thine art Of this weak flesh a marble woman win, Or hide in rock-bands, which shall burst apart As Love breaks out to meet Art breaking in; For as the sea-shell liveth in the stone Imprisoned, so may human flesh and bone.â âAnd then she spake of marvels, sorceries Of Thessaly, and old Egyptian spells, Taught her long since by one among the wise, A woman feared amid her native fells, Who knew what words enchanted Niobe, And what laid Daphne in a laurel-tree. âAlas, how blinded were mine eyes! Mine ears How stopped! that I should heed her, and allow That softest heart and fount of golden tears To turn itself to stone, that living brow To lose its sunny changes and grow still For ever, just to glut diseased self-will! â'Twas midnight, and the full moon shone on her; Her whiter limbs against the marble gleamed Of the huge stone to be her sepulchre. âFarewell,â her dark eyes whispered, and there seemed Echoes of farewell from long lonely years To murmur through the room, and ghostly tears. âBut harder than the marble was my heart In dire ambition. The dark words were said 'Twixt her and me; fulfilled the fearful art; She stepped upon the stone as to a bed, And all her warm blood froze, and every limb Mixed with the marble, white and dead and dim. âAnd sleep came on me, and a cruel dream Of love and wedded life. But in the morn No wife lay by me: that great stone did gleam Still in the house, and all the house forlorn; And to my tools I hasted, to set free My marble prisoner for the world to see. âBut lo, there came a crying to my door, Some wind of rumour woke, I know not how; And ever grew the question more and more âWhere is thy wife?â Some brand was on my brow Of toil or sorrow; and all voices cried âA murderer! Let him die as she has died!â âBefore the judge they haled me; and I knew My life lay at a wind-breath. Then aloud I cried before them, ere the judgment flew, âO Aphrodite, judge me!â And the crowd Stilled for a moment, and upon the still A voice came none knew whence, not loud nor shrill: ââTo winds and waves the marble and the man!â No more; but this had saved me; for indeed Divine that voice was. And in haste they ran Shoreward, and found the ship, the seafolks' meed Giv'n yearly to the goddess of the sea. Therein they set the marble freight and me. The sails were set and bound the rudder-bands; Like a fair purpose blew the steady wind. By rocky islands and low purple lands We passed, and land and landmarks left behind. Nor rope I touched, nor sail, but with good will My fate gave to the goddess to fulfil. âAll day I saw her in the silver waves, And nightly in great dreams she came to me, And ever showed me, over rocks and caves, A shining temple looking o'er the sea, A vacant temple and bare pedestal; Till I knew certainly how fate should fall. âYe know, ye men of Melos, how I brought My treasure hither through the deadly storm; And how these hands in yonder temple wrought Your goddess in such all-surpassing form; And what great love hath Aphrodite shown To this your island, all the world hath known. âBut this ye know not, how no dragging day Nor dreadful night has since gone o'er my head Without so dark oppression that I pray From morn till midnight only to be dead. The moon shows blacker than a tarnished shield, And green earth bloody as a battle-field. âAnd in my ears there sounds with every breath The voice of her I loved, who still doth cry To be delivered from that iron death And icy prison, where in agony Her cramped and palsied muscles must endure, Save the hand frees her that did once immure. âYe cruel men of Melos! Even now, Had ye not stayed me, I had set her free, Had broke the marble casing of her brow, And loosed the rigid fetter of the knee, And from the ruins of the shattered stone, As from a corpse, that gracious soul had flown.â Abrupt he ended, for his eye had seen How all men hung attentive, and the hands That held had loosed him; marked the space between The low wall's barrier and where he stands; And with a quick leap, like a wild thing's bound, He is forth and runs upon the outer ground. No outstretched hand could grasp him, nor no threat Stay him, nor fleetest foot could overtake; Up the steep street his urgent course is set Towards the temple that white thing to break. The wild goat, swiftest climber of the crag, Beside those flying feet had seemed to lag. Fierce their pursuit was, deadly their intent; But ere they reached the temple, they might hear A blow, a crash, a cry of full content; And, entered, saw the sculptor fallen, near The image maimed, whose mighty arm had slain In falling him who outraged thus the fane. He smiled in death; above him the cold face (So some averred) a calm unwonted wore. Two white doves, or things dovelike, from the place Flew softly. Rumour made the story more; And lo, the goddess in her marred estate Seemed rather grown diviner and more great.</field>
