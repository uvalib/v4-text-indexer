      <field name="fulltext">A CHARACTER. So noble that he cannot see He stands in aught above the rest, But does his greatness easily, And mounts his scaffold with a jest; Not vaunting any daily death, Because he scorns the thing that dies, And not in love with any breath That might proclaim him grand or wise. Not much concerned with schemes that show The counterchange of weak with strong, But never passing by a woe, Nor sitting still to watch a wrong. Of all hearts careful save his own; Most tender when he suffers most; Wont, if a foe must be o'erthrown, To count, but never grudge the cost. Sharp insight, severing with a glance Greater from less, from substance shade; Faith, in gross darkness of mischance Unable to be much afraid; Out-looking eyes that seek and scan, Ready to love what they behold; Quick reverence for his brother-man; Quick sense where gilding is not gold. Such impulse in his self-control, It seems a voluntary grace, The careless grandeur of a soul That holds no mirror to its face. True sympathy, a light that grows And broadens like the summer morn's; A hope that trusts before it knows, Being out of tune with all the scorns. On-moving, temperately intent On radiant ends by means as bright, And never cautious, but content With all the bitter fruits of right. Under this shade the tired may lie, Worn with the greatness of their way; Under this shield the brave may die, Aware that they have won the day. For such a leader lifts his times Out of the limits of the night, And, falling grandly, while he climbs, Falls with his face toward the height. A CONTRAST. Trained tenderly by Heaven and Earth, Up grew she to her gentle height,â Grew to the level of the light That shines by every placid hearth. Her days so filled with joyful hopes, If any one should fade and fail, She hath no leisure to bewail; As shuts the rose, the lily opes; As blooms the lily, dies the rose; And she can hardly see to choose, Among the glitter of the dews, 'Twixt hope that comes and joy that goes. For that she had was pure and sweet; It lies upon her breast, a balm; And that she seeks is sweet and calm; It breathes a perfume at her feet. And all around the world she looks, And wonders about grief and sin; She hath no evidence within; She only knows of them in books. Sometimes a little evil voice Speaks, and is silenced by a prayer; Sometimes she sees the face of Care, That having wept, she may rejoice. She touches sorrow with her hand, Taught softly not to shrink nor frown, But bring her pity bravely down To depths she cannot understand. The love which is her living fence (No barrier, but an atmosphere) Makes all surrounding shapes of fear Servants and shields for innocence. Her daily food of joy endues Her aspect with such powers and signs, That for all sadder hearts she shines A very angel of good news. The glorying eyes that watch her growth Appeal to all the world around, âWas ever such a maiden found?â And âWho is worthy of her troth?â Yet, under all, the feeling lurks, As ever since the world began, To make a helpmeet for a man Is woman's perfectest of works. So this fair pageant of her life, This gradual walk through upward ways, This melody of tuneful days, Must finish in the name of wife. But, slow of choice (no fairy now Brings the fit princess to her prince), Thought-shadows scarce have deepened since Childhood lay smooth upon her brow. And many a boldness fails before The bright composure of her glance, And stayed is many a swift advance, And powerless much of worldly lore. Checked hopes rebel; the mothers cry, âSee to what end these dreamers come! She hath no heart except for home, And man shall never hear her sigh!â The sons among themselves aver Their taste is for a shallower strain; They have not cared to woo in vain; They pass their blunders on to her. But here and there a soul receives Unconscious vision of its queen, And fragrance as from flowers unseen That have not yet come through the leaves. You hear the soothing talk of some, âThey would not,âif they would they might,â With vexed denials of the light, And prophecies, âHer day shall come.â But she through all the tumult sings Delightsome melodies of dawn, And sees not any shadow drawn Upon the whiteness of her wings. How first her tardy trouble grew The watchers saw not; keen and wise To note a difference in her eyes, Yet it was there before they knew. A dream with no interpreter, The weaving of a happy spell With some mute pathos of farewell, Not hers, but childhood leaving her. As if pale opal depths should warm And kindle till the gem became A living miracle of flame Without its first mysterious charm; So that capacity which lay In the last petal of the flower Becomes a fire, a pang, a power, To sweep the softer life away. Reluctant and ashamed, she sees Her simple sovereignty depart; And loses patience with her heart, And pleads for strength upon her knees, And tells herself 'tis false, and shakes The trifle from her maiden fame; Yet blushes when she thinks his name, And knows each movement that he makes; And finds herself in sudden tears, Scorns her sweet nature as a crime, Looks to the coming calm of Time, And longs to overleap the years. O little garden in the wood, So full of safe and tender bloom! God guide the footsteps that presume To break thy breezeless solitude. God bless the deed! for it is done, The moment is proclaimed at last; A word divides her from her past; Her song is sung, her life begun. He came from unfamiliar ways To pluck this blossom for his breast, With this one merit, that he guessed At treasures hidden from his gaze. From unfamiliar ways he came; If you had set them side by side, His life and her unsullied tide, You might have thought his love was shame. So judge not men. His name stood well; He sneered his tedious modern sneer At everything above his sphere, And was contented in his shell. The cynic scorn, that should have mailed A finer thought, went through his soul; A mean ideal held the whole, And kept his conscience unassailed. He was not better than he seemed, Nor worse than he desired; he gazed With condescension and amazed On good weak men who toiled and dreamed. That old name-heritage, which grew In deeper days, is still the plan, Though our serener âgentlemanâ Shrink from the rigorous line it drew. Not chivalrous, methinks, is he; Not very truthful, for he needs To hide at home his daily deeds, On pretext âwomen should not see.â But brave at heart and blithe of cheer, A generous smile, a courtly glance, A foot unrivalled in the dance, The bearing of a cavalier; Smooth polished by his upper throng, And charitable as the light; For they who burn not for the right Find free excuses for the wrong. She, in her listening sweetness, tries The natural music of her part, And, looking upward, thinks his heart As much above her as his eyes. Too wise to share her childish heat, Too great to kindle when she moves, Yet lifting her, because he loves, From her due station at his feet. He puts each nobler utterance by, And scorns himself for what he is; She (how she trusts!) reveres in this Some choice reserve of modesty. âI talk, he does; 'tis English rule To do the deed and leave the talk; I too, when at his side I walk, May learn in such a lofty school.â She goes so gaily to her fate; They who might rescue stand afar: âHe is a man as others are, And fit for any woman's mate.â He loves her;âwhat do women seek? Henceforth 'tis well; the two are one, And that unholy past is done Of which she must not ask nor speak. He drops into his purer place (These stronger beings must begin With their full privilege of sin). If there be memories in his face Which daze her, she need never know What comes between him and his bliss; She only asks for leave to kiss Some sudden aching from his brow. But how these daily lives can blend (I set a problem of the time), Whose thought shall sink and whose may climb, And whence the light, and what the end, 'Tis hard to guess. The day may break When that slow painful pile of truth Is heaped at last, and all her youth Has but to mount and die awake. When, film by film, the colours fade, And she, where she believed, beholds, And has no further hope, and folds Her life into a prayer for aid: Or sometimes, with a weary smile, Remembers what she dreamed, and sighs, And shuts her unreproachful eyes, And whispers, âYet a little while.â Or her blind heart may stoop and lean To where he stands, until she move Under the burden of a love Which will not let the sky be seen, Till daily watch on ways of his Makes her degrade the type, because She will not see the broken laws;â I think she will be saved from this. OrâLet us lift the veil a space From the last chance! She takes his hand, While thoughts he does not understand Have drawn the colour from her face. âWhat is it, love?â He knows his power; He holds her gently. Then she speaks, And that pure paleness of her cheeks Trembles and flushes like a flower. âYou must not frown. I have a shame, A something which you ought to know; I should have told it long ago,â You will forgive, though you must blame: âBefore you wooed me I was sought,â I know not why. I told you true, I never cared for man but you, Yet once I wavered in my thought. âAnd I was vain, as girls are vain, But, O! it was a fault to play With one true spirit for a day! I could not do the deed again.â âSo I, most confident of men, Was not the first!â She shook her head; For, âO! it was a fault!â she said, And âI have wept for it since then.â And âO! it was a fault!â he says, And puts it from him as a jest; Yet takes the word into his breast, To keep it there for many days. The wonder of that fault! It grows, It speaks and thrills him in the night, Till his cleansed eyes perceive the light Of something purer than he knows. White soul, with such a fault! He thinks, Is, then, the darker soul more strong Because it does the deeper wrong? Because it fails? because it sinks? Lo, touch by touch, a hand unseen Paints a slow picture in his thought, He cannot choose but see it wrought; He knows such beauty may have been; He knows it is! He once was blind, But by this soft home-light discerns Things he believed not once, and learns To think more truly of his kind. So for a year he holds his peace, And meditates on noble things, And listens while a seraph sings, And all the meaner voices cease. Till, laughing once, she says with pride, âSee, love, how sage your wife has grown! You never check her with that tone Of fond contempt you gave your bride.â He looks at her with reverent eyes, He clasps her with a generous shame; âThere was a revelation came From your angelic fault!â he cries. HERO HAROLD. I. In his tent, at fall of day, Hero Harold loosed his mail, As a bark which nears the bay Drops on deck her clattering sail. Eyes that look the looker through, Brow that shame hath never bowed, Lips that ne'er spake word untrueâ Where's a face so fair and proud?â Came a stripling to the tent, Watched him while an hour went round, Saw his stately discontent, Dared not greet him while he frowned. Up the warrior looked at last, âFriendâ (his smile was something grim), âCheap thine hours, if one is past Staring at my strength of limb!â âCheap my life,â the stripling cried, âIf it buy an hour for thee! Harold! Death is at thy sideââ âThere,â quoth Harold, âlet him be. âDeath and I are friends of old.â Then he spake in softer wise: âCome thou near till all is told; Shake the woman from thine eyes. âNothing in my life was made, Since its fighting-days began, Meet for laughter from a maid, Or for weeping from a man. âWarriors' tears are seeds of blood, Girls go crying at a word, Boys, if born for any good, Cry for nothing but a sword!â Sternly Siva set his face, Smitten hard by friendly scorn, And the babe in him gave place To the savage lately born. All the tender lines contract When that fiery touch runs through; As a Fancy to a Fact Seems the old face to the new. Change that melted as it came, Swiftly as a hue of day. But the face was not the same When that moment passed away. By such moments, hundred-fold, Shaping life from now to then, In those iron days of old Babes were welded into men. When the finished man appeared, Strong and brave, and fierce and wild, You might mutter to your beard, âThis has never been a child!â Siva grasps the hero's hand: âHardly can I speak for shame, For a lie is in the land, And it creeps about thy name. âWhen the silver daylight grew Out of yonder gloomy hill, Thorwold, found among the dew, Lay, before his mother, still. âWaked not when she kissed his lip, Stirred not when they moved his sword; Dumb as a forsaken ship, Useless as a bowl outpoured!â Harold shook his spear and laughed, âThorwold died; the word is true; Still the point is on the shaft, Who will try its force anew? âOn the broad noon-lighted plain Fought we while the day went past, Fought I till my foe was slainâ He is not the first nor last. âBid his mother cease to grieve, She has still two sons of might; Let them, ere another eve, Strive to slay me in her sight!â Siva spoke with burning cheek: âThere, where Thorwold lieth stark, Not of sunny war they speak, But of murder in the dark!â âWho are these that say such things?â This was all that Harold said, But his face was as a king's When he lifted up his head. Out he thundered, scorning odds, Stalked into the judgment-hall, And his face was as a god's When he stood before them all. There, while warriors held their breath, Uncomposed by patient hand Thorwold lay, a heap of death, Heavy on the hollowed sand. Up, with tossing arms untwined, Rose the mother of the Grave (So when sinks a desperate wind Rises one reluctant wave). Silence waits about the place, Hero Harold backward draws When that white and withered face Flashes on him in the pause. Then the general wrath brake out In a vast and bitter cry, Then they judged him with a shout, Bade him choose his death and die: Through the forest's pathless dark All a summer's day to flee, Or to drift in oarless bark At the pity of the sea. So HuscÃ¡rlas doom their dead. Harold spake with open brow: âNever yet my foot hath fled, Death could never teach it how; âGive me to the unconquered sea! Daily, since the worlds begin, She is beaten gloriously, Only to return and win.â Siva panted, âLet him go! Three must doom him!â âThree shall doom!â Echo answers black and slow From the brothers of the Tomb. Forth they pace, and as by force, Yet with calm and reverent hands, Lift the mother from the corse Till between her sons she stands. Blood-drops on her silver hair, From the bosom of the dead; In her settled eyes' despair, Hunger, that shall soon be fed. From the Dark Decisive Three, Lead they Harold to the strand, Set his boat upon the sea, Part the cable from the land; Watch him through the sinking light With his face toward the hills, Where through spreading tracts of night Shine the many-threaded rills. Eyes that look the lookers through, Brow that shame hath never bowed, Lips that ne'er spake word untrue, Where's a face so fair and proud? Watched on every moving crest, Lost in every hollow space, Drifts the hero to his rest With the sunset on his face; Till where purple curves are high. On the last faint fading line, Into that unfathomed sky, Down he drops without a sign. II. Under windless domes of sky, Gradual blue that dips to gold, Under clouds that where they lie Melt, but never move a fold, Slow soft dawns, unwilling, pale, Of the coming noon afraid; Films of moonlight, dewy, frail (O! how fair in forest glade!), Over crystal breadths that take Light and shadow like a plain, Moved by secret powers to make Scarce a ripple in its train, Drifts the bark; with softer will Floats not any poisÃ¨d bird, When the governed airs are still, By no noise of plumage stirred. Not a murmur where she drifts Creeps to any listening cave; Not a breath of summer lifts Any foam-drop from a wave. Where, unseen, the movements steal Parted waters hardly chafe; Just a whisper at the keel Sayeth ever, âStill and safe.â Like a chord that splits apart Halfway through some placid psalm, Showed that stormy face and heart In the centre of the calm. Ardours of rejoicing strife, Mere delights of strength were there, Agonies of hope and life On the bosom of despair. Now the morning time comes back, All besprent with growing lights; Now his foot is on the track, Mounting to heroic heights. Ha! the world is full of shouts, Battle thunders on the blast, He, with hand on falchion, doubtsâ Is he waking? is it past? But the waters close and clasp All about his bright desire, Soft as any loving grasp, Ruthless as a ring of fire. And the stillness and the sway Of the boat, the sky, the deep, Seem to coax his heart away Till it drifts with them asleep. As a dreamy touch that strays On the keys at set of sun Opens up a thousand ways, Ceases ere it follows one; So his eyes grow vague and vain, Heavy with a hope unfound, So the prelude of his strain Dies in silence, not in sound. Have you seen a sudden ray Break into some woodland gloom, Showing, shedding on its way Streams of unsuspected bloom? Waking where its tremors move Such new glory in the place, As the blush and smile of love Wake on some neglected face? What you saw was fair and sweet; Fairer, sweeter far, I ween, Flash of Ebba's dancing feet Down the seaward slopes of green. Where they pass, wind, water, hill, Sing and quiver with delight; When they pause, the world is still, Watching for a second flight. Now they touch the spray and swerve, Now they brave it,âsee her stand With the shallow crystal curve At her ankle's golden band. Planted so, she leans, she plays, On the wind against her breast, While one doubtful hand delays With the clasping of her vest, And youth's seeking eyes pervade All the limits, ere they bow On a nearer wonder laid At her feet. She sees it now, That forlornest thing,âthe sea, Thrusts it in with scorn, and cries, âUseless is this dust to me,â Take it, earth!â and there it lies. Half in spray and half on sand, At her living feet a face, And the pleading of a hand Flung against her sandal lace, But there stillâand colder than The slow waves that as they choose Push this mockery of man All about the bitter ooze. Wise with sudden pity, she Crouches on the broadening sands, Draws the poor head to her knee With a nursing-mother's hands, Pours the treasure of her breath Down on breast and brow and face, Pleads so tenderly with Death, That at last he grants her grace. See, a sigh, a throb, a start, Thrill against her clasping arm (Near that young abundant heart Even marble might grow warm!). Sweet hope-murmurs in his ear For rough wind and water-moan, Purest eyes, that, very near, Melt the horror from his own. So he wakes; and so at last Harder souls may wake from strife, Losing all a stormy past In the life that gives them life. III. When Bird Ebba first was wed, Wroth I ween was all the land; âWas there none of us,â they said, âWorthy of the damsel's hand? âOther homes might make her great, Other arms might hold her safe, Must she search the seas to mate With a phantom and a waif? âWho is Harold?â Harold heard, As the careless sea may hear Wail of discontented bird, Crying that a storm is near; For his soul had set aside All the harder dreams of youth, And was standing glorified In the tender light of Truth. New unconscious dreads of sin Steal to him he knows not whence, And a faint voice tells within Mysteries of innocence. In his veins a purer fire, In his voice a softer key, On his heart the word âAspire!â This is Love for such as he. Turning back reluctant eyes To the tumult and the stir, Sees he Ebba's face, and sighs, âNot a shade must fall on her.â Soon the old fame-hunger wakes, And the mighty joy of swords; But from Ebba's face it takes Generous thoughts and gentle words. (So the lovely morning flows Round some dark terrific tower, Till it softens, till it glows, Till it blossoms like a flower.) âCome,â he cried, âfor Ebba's love, Let us strive a summer's day!â Then a summer's day they strove, And he bore the prize away. Still they show the place of meed Where he pitched the bar and ball, Where he clove the beechen steed, Where his leaps outleapt them all; Where his wonder-shafts went true, Chased by unbelieving eyes; Where his foes to earth he threw, Stretched his hands, and bade them rise; His big heart no faster beat (Such composure in its strength) Till he sate at Ebba's feet, Just a little flushed at length. Then it bounded; not for fame, Not for shouts along the air, But for one soft touch that came For a moment on his hair. âKing you are!â the people cried, âSon of waves and king of men!â So to Harold and his bride All the tribe bring homage then. Raise the roof and plant the hearth, Sow the field and drive the kine, Great sea wedding gentle earth, For a blessing and a sign. So they lived through night and morn, Peace and war, and joy and tears; So were sons and daughters born, Links among the changing years. No man dared to wrong the poor, Never foe by treason bled, Never stranger from the door Went unwelcomed or unfed. Till at last a stranger came, Standing, hoary, in the gate, Saying softly Harold's name, Like a man who fears his fate. Watching strangely while he spoke Harold with his sons around, Like a great storm-beaten oak In a growing garden-ground, Saying âHarold,â and no more; Harold lifts his stately face; âEnter, friend, the day is o'er, Come and rest, and take your place.â Then their meeting looks were blent In strange question and reply; Over Harold's visage went One vast wave of memory; And his soul went swiftly through Precious and familiar ways, Where the very ground was dew, In the sweet beginning days. âSiva!â (Ebba thrills to feel That sure arm about her waist, Ever thus in woe or weal.) âHarold!â And the men embraced. âHarold, we have mourned you long, Time has cleared your noble name; All the land that did you wrong Calls you home in love and shame. âIn the hall, the field, the chase, Sombre council, festal board, Wail they for your empty place, Clamour for your useless sword.â Slowly Harold smiles around; Place so filled, and sword so tired! For a warrior wived and crowned, What is left to be desired? Having played his glorious part, Here he stands, and here should fallâ But the great tide in his heart Rises till it covers all! Now the morning time comes back, All besprent with growing lights; Now his foot is on the track, Mounting to heroic heights. Still for him does sunset gild Those last hills he used to climb, And the old man's face is filled With the glory of his prime. Yet he speaks not. Ebba speaks, With that arm about her waist, And a blush upon her cheeks, Sweeter than the first he traced: âLet us seek this land of thine!â Harold says below his breath, âSpeak thine own heart, speak not mine!â âNay, but they are one,â she saith. So, to satisfy his heart, Where the great grief burned unseen, Harold and his wife depart To the home that might have been. When the good white cliffs he saw, First he shouted, then he sighed, Then his children turned with awe From their father's tears aside. When his keel was on the shore, All the tribe came down to greet; Somewhat slower than of yore Seem their Hero's coming feet. To the hills he lifts his eyes; âNothing changed!â his lips proclaim. Then he sees the men and sighs, âAh, but nothing is the same!â Turning from the accustomed sea, Stretching forth benignant hands, This vast weight of memory Makes him stagger where he stands, Makes him fall. But, ready there, One, for ever near him, draws To her breast his silver hair, While the rushing people pause; Pours the treasure of her breath Down on cheek, and lip, and browâ Ah! but this familiar death Shrinks not from her presence now. Will the old fame-hunger rouse? Hear the people's shout and song! Bind a chaplet for his brows! Praise his name, and tell his wrong! Closer grew the wife's embrace: âHear you what they shout?â she cried; But he, looking in her face, Only said,âMy love!â and died. THE LITTLE FAIR SOUL. (A PARABLE.) A little fair soul that knew not sin Looked over the edge of Paradise, And saw one striving to come in With fear and tumult in his eyes. âOh, brother, is it you?â he cried; âYour face is like a breath from home; Why do you stay so long outside? I am athirst for you to come! âTell me first how our mother fares, And has she wept too much for me?â âWhite are her cheeks and white her hairs, But not from gentle tears for thee.â âTell me where are our sisters gone?â âAlas, I left them weary and wan.â âAnd tell me, is the baby grown?â âAlas, he is almost a man. âCannot you break the gathering days And let the light of death come through, Ere his feet stumble in the maze Crossed safely by so few, so few? âFor like a cloud upon the sea That darkens till you find no shore, So was the face of life to me, Until I sank for evermore; âAnd like an army in the snow My days went by, a treacherous train, Each smiling as he struck his blow, Until I lay among them, slain.â âOh, brother, there was a path so clear!â âThere might be, but I never sought.â âOh, brother, there was a sword so near!â âThere might be, but I never fought.â âYet sweep this needless gloom aside, For you are come to the gate at last!â Then in despair that soul replied, âThe gate is fast, the gate is fast!â âI cannot move this mighty weight, I cannot find this golden key, But hosts of heaven around us wait, And none has ever said ânoâ to me. âSweet Saint, put by thy palm and scroll, And come undo the door for me!â âRest thee still, thou little fair soul, It is not mine to keep the key.â âKind Angel, strike these doors apart! The air without is dark and cold.â âRest thee still, thou little pure heart, Not for my word will they unfold.â Up all the shining heights he prayed For that poor Shadow in the cold; Still came the word, âNot ours to aid; We cannot make the doors unfold.â But that poor Shadow, still outside, Wrung all the sacred air with pain, And all the souls went up and cried Where never cry was heard in vain. No eye beheld the pitying Face, The answer none might understand, But dimly through the silent space Was seen the stretching of a Hand. APRIL SHADOWS. He said there was on earth no fairer sight Than April shadows from the tall green flags We taunted him with overflows of light From walls of sunrise upon Alpine crags; Or pageantries of tropic flowers that swoon In the vague, passionate atmosphere of noon; Or ranks of crested tumult in the deep, Or banners of broad tempest on the sky, But he went murmuring, like a man asleep, About those April shadows constantly, And once I thought I heard him call them âgrand.â I smiled, but scoffed not. Then he took my hand, And, looking at me gravely, like a man About to tell a secret, thus began: The great flags grow sedately. Down in glades The riot and hurry of the rising spring Know them for rulers. All their emerald blades, Threaded with fires of gold, stand near the shades, Kept trimly ready for some fairy king; A blossom hides in every guardian sheaf Till summer calls it. Each particular leaf, Sharp as a spear and tender as a plume, Lets fall its little breadth of crystal gloom To wave and flutter on the windy grass, Or to lie still, if not a sigh should pass The lips of patient evening. None can name The colour of these shadows, for they keep The tiny snow-stars and the cups of flame Safe in their shelter, softened, yet the same, Like sights we love remembered in our sleep. On the fine limit of their lines of night, Grasses are gems, and lingering dewdrops sparks; They are not shadows, they are ambushed Light, They are not lights, but they are lustrous darks, Films which no force can rend, no skill hath wrought, Impalpable and permanent as thought. I saw them firstâand here he dropped his voice, As if he feared to wrong a sight so choice By talking of it rashlyâon a day Of long delight, just at the brink of May; All through rich silence of the woods I heard The young world growing. Aimless and at ease, Moving or pausing, like a joyful bird Who dips and poises on the swinging seas, For ten delicious hours, at last I found These shadows making wonderful the ground For none to see. A sentinel I stood And watched. No louder footstep than a fay's Touched the frail echoes, till with long delays A slow, soft sunset filled and flushed the wood, And sank and left us. Then I understood How all the sweetness of this day of days Had passed into the shadows, till they wore (Like that enchanted ring which seals for good The long love-volume after and before) Its glory in their heart for evermore. THE FISHERMAN. Fisherman, speak to me; why so lonely Sailing away when the boats come home? âI have a little one, I must find him, Out where the sunset kindles the foam. âDying he talked to the wild green water, Out of his window he watched the spray; How should the daisies have power to keep him? Somewhere the sea-gulls watch him at play. âEmpty and cold is the shore without him, Empty and dry must it ever be; Let me alone, for the sea consoles me, Out in the waters he waits for me. âEmpty and cold is the house without him, Empty and dark through the open door; Will he not laugh when he hears me coming, Coming to carry him home once more!â Bars of wet sunshine the boat sprang over, Shaking her sails into sheets of gold; Back through the moonlight she drifted darkly, Rocking at random, empty and cold. A MEETING. Two that wrecked each other's hope, Parting coldly in their prime, Met upon the downward slope, Taught by tears, and calmed by time, Under Autumn's perfect trees, Dropping bright remembrances. There they spread their stories out, Face to face, and hand to hand, Looking back with wistful doubt Into the forgotten land Where the wheels of life went fast, Hardly seen till they were past: Looking where the dawn had been Till each grey and pallid line Shivers with a sun unseen Which must never rise and shine, And the Moment, lost and vain, Comes before their souls again: Saying softly, âYes, I think You were there,âyou came at ten.â âIn your hair was something pink; How I hate the hue since then!â âHate a harmless ribbon!â âNay, I have pardoned it to-day. âI remember what you said.â âBut you laughed, and I despaired.â âDid I laugh? I was afraid You might fancy that I cared.â âBe content, your pride shall be Scatheless as your heart for me.â âSomething in your voice assures You have angry feelings yet.â âSomething told me then in yours That you would notâquiteâforget; Just one foolish moment lit Hope,âthat laugh extinguished it.â âSure the flame was very weak!â â'Twas your silence let it die.â âIf a man's hope will not speak, Can a woman's heart reply?â âHad I spoken?â âDo I know? It was very long ago!â Face to face, and hand in hand, Looking at those eastern skies, Is the light along the land Only borrowed from their eyes? Can the song of birds be drawn From a memory of dawn? Lo, the hill, the sea, the plain, Flushing with familiar rose! Look away, and look again, But the colour stays and grows! Wherefore stand amazed and dumb? Knew you not that morn must come? A REMEMBRANCE. Other thoughts have parted me From thy tender memory; Spaces like a cloudy sea Lie between mine eyes and thee. Buried sunsets heave and glow Where I would but must not go; Purple storm and golden veil Make the lovely distance pale. O! I want, across the cloud, Once to hear thee speak aloud; Not with those faint tones that seem Like a summons in a dream; Not with those faint tones that fleet Daily by me in the street, Ceasing but to sound again, While I turn my head in vain. One vast moment, to content Hunger of my banishment; One strong clasp, and then I know I could bear to let thee go! WAITING FOR THE TIDE. (SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE. Painted by W.W. Fenn, Esq.) Come down, those shadowed sands invite, And that soft glory on the deep; We breathe an atmosphere of light, Subtle as dew, and calm as sleep. See, here and there, beyond the foam, A sail is shining like a gem; I think the boats are coming home, We'll linger down and look at them. Not yet; the tide is shy, and stays By this grey limit of our pier; It doubts, it trembles, it delays, Yet, all the while, is drawing near. The boats and we must wait its will. O pleasant patience! They to make (While we behold them and lie still) A hundred pictures for our sake. O happy patience! Not a hue Can flutter through the changing air, Or mould the cloud, or touch the blue, That is not meant for them to wear. And as they watch the glimmering sand, That warms the film within the foam, They know the welcome wave at hand, The tender wave that lifts them home. It comes; they pass; each turning sail Is first a hope, and then a bliss. Come home and dream a fairy tale Whose end shall be as sweet as this! âWIND ME A SUMMER CROWN,â SHE SAID. Wind me a summer crown,â she said, âAnd set it on my brows; For I must go, while I am young, Home to my Father's house. âAnd make me ready for the day, And let me not be stayed; I would not linger on the way, As if I was afraid. âO! will the golden courts of heaven, When I have paced them o'er, Be lovely as my lily walks Which I must see no more? âAnd will the seraph hymns and harps, When they have filled my ear, Be tender as my mother's voice, Which I must never hear? âAnd shall I lie where sunsets drift, Or where the stars are born, Or where the living tints are mixed To paint the clouds of morn?â Your mother's tones shall reach you still, Even sweeter than they were; And the false love that broke your heart Shall be forgotten there. And not of star or flower is born The beauty of that shore; There is a Face which you shall see, And wish for nothing more. âONCE UPON A TIME.â Not only echoes from the past Talk to us in that tender phrase; It rings upon our hearts at last, A watchword for the coming days: When, having reached those heights of rest, We point to where we stood below; And how we scaled each tedious crest, With hopes how faint, and steps how slow! How once we shrank from toils which prove The test and triumph of our might; And once we basely doubted Love, Which now surrounds us with its light. O! that we could this hour begin The lesson of our evening time, And say to parting, pain, and sin, âWe knew youâonce upon a time!â A DISCOVERY. The languid world went by me as I found A jewel on the ground, Under a silent weed, A nameless glory set for none to heed. âStoop, see, and wonder!â was my joyful cry, But still the languid world went only by. I drew it forth, and set it on a hill; They passed it still. Some turned to look, And said it was a pebble from the brook, A dewdrop, only made to melt away, A worthless mirror, with a borrowed ray. Then on my knees I shouted forth its praise, For nights and days. âSee with your eyes A diamond shining only for the wise! How is it that ye love not at first sight This unfamiliar treasure of pure light?â I set it on my breast. Then, with a sneer, The world drew near. They knew the sign And secret of my praise; the thing was mine. They left it to me with a bland disdain, And hugged their tinsel to their hearts again. I showed it to the dearest soul I had: âYou are not mad; Let them go by; We know it is a diamond, you and I.â Coldly he answered, âIf you love it so, You need not me to praise it. Let me go.â âIt is my sin,â I cried with bitter tears, âThat no man hears. I'll fling it down; Some nobler hand shall set it in a crown. I shall behold it honoured ere I die; But no one could have loved it more than I!â A GIRL'S LOVE-SONG. It was an April morning When my true love went out; The wind had never a warning; The sky had never a doubt. Leaves and blossoms were lustres On oak and maple and beech; Hopes were hanging in clusters A little out of reach. He wanderedâhe and no otherâ Down by the little white brook; The stones sang one to another, âA king is coming; look!â The brook said, laughing and leaping, âPeep, and you shall see.â Through the leaves he went peeping, And there he sawâMe. Saw me, took me, crowned me, There, as I stood in my shame; I knew that he had found me, Before I knew his name. I went where I was fated, Dumb with fear and surprise. A week and a day I waited, Before I saw his eyes, I gave him never a whisper For all the words he said; The brook was a pleasant lisper, It talked to him instead. Brook, you told my emotion, Hearing him plight his vow! Brook, you have not a notion What I feel for him now! WHEN THE NEWS ABOUT THE âTRENTâ CAME. Faint as a sigh the weary light Touches the verge before it drops; The rustle of descending night Is felt through all the breathless copse. A great slow shadow dims the sea, And ships come softly through its haze, Like passing shapes seen doubtfully By eyes that ache while sleep delays. A ship had brought us word at morn, How some mad world beyond the sea Stood up to fling a look of scorn In face of England's majesty. And all our land was thinking war; I, too, with powerless hopes and hands, Watched while each pale deliberate star Struck this wet purple in the sands; And felt, for each red boss of rock, Now blackening as the night-time grows; Each curve of these cliff-walls that lock Our precious freedom from our foes; For each small circuit traced by foam, And marking England to my sight, Each fringe and fragment of my home, I could have wished to die to-night. âWINDY AND GREY THE MORNING.â Windy and grey the morning, Rainy and low the light; A woman wandered by me, And, O! her cheeks were white! A man came out to meet her, But never a word he said, Till she laid her hands upon his breast, And whispered, âHe is dead.â They two looked at each other, And the love and the loss of years Went over their faces like a cloud, Breaking into tears. I knew she had been watching The sorrowful long night through, And when her watch was over, A sweet life was over too. I knew he had been waiting For a word which he felt before; But faint hope came with her coming step, Then went for evermore. They two looked at each other, And silently passed away; And the winter sun went wearily up, To make another day. A LETTER. Where were you when I suffered? My heart was very faint; It wanted a heart to lean on; where was yours at the time? I hope you were happy somewhere; I hope no passing taint Of the chill air I was breathing troubled your softer clime. Always I think about you, and I am afraid at night; For before I dream I fancy, and my dreams are fancy-marred; And I see you lying wounded, with your face upturned to the light, And I cannot stoop to kiss it; and, oh, my dream is hard! Last night I read and waited, there was but the light of the fire, When I thought you stood behind me, and I dared not turn my head. Why was my heart so poor as to shrink from its best desire? I think you were here for a moment; but when I turned, you were fled. Where were you at that moment? were you thinking of me? Were you watching the turbans wind up the dry brown slope? And when they reached the top, and you knew they looked at the sea, Were you dreaming of England? had you an hour of hope? O! that hope is so dreary! I have it always here; Whenever it plays me false, they tell me I must not doubt. But though we call it hope, it is only a mask for fear; And it never lets me rest, and I think it is wearing me out. You will hardly know me again, I am grown so pale and thin; I looked in the glass to-day, and my face is old and strange. And I felt a pang of dread when they told me the mail was come in; For I thought if you came home, that you would not like the change. I suppose you are brown and fierce, and your eyes are ready to flash; You walk erect and swift; you have always something to do. Ah, you men are happy! you live with a burst and a dash; Weeping wastes us away, but work ennobles you. I am a pain in my home; they watch me with looks of distress; Always they soften their tones when they ask me âDear, will you go?â And because I want them to smile, I often smile and say âYes;â But as the dance grows gay, I wish I had dared to say âNo.â For I should not like, when we sit together, and talk, and trace Our joy coming step by step through the gloom while you were away,â I should not like to see one doubt flit over your face; âPerhaps she hardly missed me, her life was so light and gay.â Ah, a letter again! It brings no tidings to me. I have hardly the heart to look, and I feel too tired to speak. What, you are coming home! you are crossing the dear, kind sea! You are rushing home to me now! I shall see your face in a week! He is coming! where are you all? He is coming! do you not know? See, I am kissing the words which I was afraid to read! What are you saying, mother? why do you look at me so? âTen years younger,â mother? Yes, I should think so indeed. AMPOLA. Twenty-five shots! And, out of all the spots Where a man could stand and shoot, You would have said, âNot there.â Anywhere else it might be done, But not there! If we could plant a gun There, at the battery's foot, There, at the enemy's breast, Of course the Fort were won; But that's a grim jest, The old tale of a rest For a lever to lift the sunâ A thing not to be done. Under that rushing rain of flame, To stand still, and aimâ? Fie! send them not! There is no man alive Could fire a single shot. But Italy found a pair To stand JUST THERE, And fire twenty-five. See, the gun's in its place! Through rags of smoke, in the ring of your glass, You may see a busy face, Or a quiet figure pass Hard at work, and so near You almost fancy you hear. One loads, one firesâthat's all! (All but the hope and the fear.) Now they look up and smile, If they had a minute to spare They would stop and shake hands there; Italy, give them a cheer, And get ready to charge, for while You look, there's a breach in the wall. The gap grows large. Not wide enough yet for a charge, But nearlyâthey work with a will! One, he is but a boy, Has such a look of joy; The other, a year or two older, A little grave and still, But not a whit colder, Like a man who knows What he leaves, and where he goes, With ready heart; Why not? He has done his part. He was on Marsala's shore; If he must leave the land he frees, Love goes with him under the sod; He gives a gallant soul to God, And Garibaldi sees,â He wants no more. That's the tenth shot! The blast Of the shells rushing past Is shaking their hairâ On they work, and God takes careâ Death not in, it is the air! Twenty! The wall gives way. The two look back to their ranks, And nod, and say, âExcuse us for making you wait so long! You are getting ready? Thanks! In a minute you may come.â They are quite at home, Not a fold in the browâ They are getting used to it now; We are afraid no more! Twenty-four. Twenty-five. Is anything wrong? Take the glass and look! What do you say that you see? Nothingâ? Your hand shook; Pass it to me! Twenty-fiveâere I fix, It will be twenty-six. Now! There's the gun. But the place is void. What lies on the plain? Do not look again! Dead, shattered, destroyed! With their work done. All but the name lost, All dead but the deed; So, and at such cost, Ampola was freed. Note.âTwo of Garibaldi's volunteers performed the exploit narrated in these lines. OUR WELCOME TO GARIBALDI. Welcome, because the glory of thy wreath Had never shade nor stain; Because thy sword sprang never from its sheath Except to cleave a chain; Because thy hands, outstretched to all who live, Armed, not for thine own sake, So strong to save, opened so wide to give, Do not know how to take; Because the crown thy brows have put away Shall for thy name endure; Because the life thou scornest every day As a child's hope is pure; Because thy foes can reckon to thy charge, Only the noble crime Of faith too liberal and love too large For this unworthy time. And when a land made feeble by despair Could only writhe and groan, Thou, making war beneficent as prayer, Didst succour her alone. What others dreamed, thou didst. Oppression fled, The hope of years was wrought; Thou only unamazed, whose daily bread Had been heroic thought. And when thy dark hour came, which comes to all, Thou didst not lose thy crown, Nor stain it, seeming greater in thy fall Than those who cast thee down. Out of the deep still speaking to the heights In accents of a king; With conscience which through thirty sleepless nights Could find no place to sting. Therefore the heart of England welcomes thee As to thy proper throne; Therefore the light and life of Italy Seem almost like our own; Nay, by these modern watchfires, as they burn On heights of hope or fear, Our old familiar Freedom may discern How great she is, how dear. And, taught by men who, suffering, win the same, She, suffering, won of yore, She, counting years for hours, may take some shame That she has done no more; That any poor or vile are in her lands, Shaming the great and free; That any soil yet lingers on the hands Stretched forth to welcome thee! IN THE MEANTIME. âIn the meantime England, France, and Austria are making representations at St. Petersburg on behalf of Poland.â (Telegram) âLeo Frankowski, having recovered from his wounds, was executed at LÃ¼blin.â In the meantime do not hurry the sword out, Let them be patient,âthey surely can wait; Will all the blood of their noblest when poured out Alter in England a tax or a rate? Wrongs may be bitter, we have not to bear them; Cannot hearts break without making a fuss? Heroes are plenty, and Europe can spare them; We never stir till the shoe pinches us. Let the rocks split under tyranny's hammer, Crush the great thought by the pitiful fact; Women and children are welcome to clamour, We, too, can talk, but don't ask us to act! In the meantime, while sweet morning is breaking, Scenting the world with the dew of her breath, One noble victim, with wounds freshly aching, Feebly and gallantly moves to his death. Three months ago how they dreaded and cursed him! How rose the land at the flash of his eye! Now with stern patience his captors have nursed him Till he can stand while they lead him to die. One wistful glance to the far faint horizon, Somewhere on earth there is freedom he knows; Then to the scaffoldâthe altar he dies on! What shall the sacrifice gain for his foes? This! Men shall tell it, indignant and breathless, Weep for the anguish and blush for the crime; This death of shame shall in honour be deathlessâ But we avenge it not, in this mean time! Land in the midst of rich Europe that starvest, Stretching thy hands, in thy weakness sublime! This is thy seedtime, be sure of the harvest, Martyrs are earning it in the meantime! SONG. Take me from these dreary shades, Lift me to some softer morn, Where the laughing light invades That old silence of the glades Which was born when trees were born; Where the docile winds take care Not to ruffle any brook, Lest queen-clouds that pace the air Should not find a mirror there When they pace, and pause, and look; Where the dazzling nights endure Till the day has passed its spring, And where starlight is so pure That no bird is ever sure Whether it should sleep or sing. Somewhere there is never rain, Never trouble in the air, Not a sigh of fear or pain,â Take me to that land again; I am sure I once was there. SLAIN. Let her lie upon your heart while she faints, Where she slept such a short time ago; O! she's young to be crowned with the saintsâ Hold her fast, mother, do not let her go! The roses are not dead on her cheeks, There is but a passing chill in their bloom; It will melt when she smiles, when she speaksâ Hush! was not that her voice in the room? She is looking like a babe as she lies With her ringlets swept aside and apartâ Ah, mother, keep the tears in your eyes, If they fall upon her face she may start. Did some one break her heart with a word, Having grasped it at first as a prize? Did it flutter from his hand, like a bird Which goes a little way, and then dies? He remembers the joy of her face, The love in her smile, and the light, When, shrinking, she met his embraceâ Bring him here, let him look at her to-night! O! first came the wonder and the doubt, And the pale hope fading day by day, So wistfully she wandered about, Like a lost child asking its way; And then came the silence and despair, And the sighing after wings like a dove, And the proud heart bleeding into prayer, But hiding all its wounds from your love. It is over and the tale is all told, And the white lamb lies dead in the frost; You may cover up its limbs from the cold, But you cannot find a life that is lost. We were thinking that she moved, but her cheek Was but stirred by the breast where she lay Heaving a moment, while we speak, With the quiet sobs forcing their way. Let them come, poor mother, let them come; You must turn when your tears are all done To a blank in the sweet talk at home, And a name on a little grey stone. A PLEA FOR BEAUTY. I heard there was no place among the powers For Beauty; that she stands not in the plan; That even the tints which glorify the flowers Came but for use, and not for joy to man. Ah, sophist, tracing through gradations fine A wondrous story hid from eyes more dull, You know how beauty comes to tint and line,â Tell us, what makes the beauty beautiful? We will be glad because the crocus takes Such tender curves before her buds are riven,â Because at morn the wave of colour breaks Like a great burst of music over heaven,â Because each accident of light or shade, The copse, the cliff, the field, the shore, endears,â Because no living thing can grow or fade Without a charm that touches us to tears,â Because the Voice proclaiming all things good, Even to the least a twofold work imparts, And colours, tempting insects to their food, Are banquets for our grateful eyes and hearts. Note.ââNature cares nothing for appearances except in so far as they may be useful.â âSome naturalists ..... believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man.This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory.â Darwin's âOrigin of Species,â pp. 83 and 199. WHAT WE MAY SEE. Lying in the shadow, looking at the sky, Proud sweet hours glance back at us, smile in passing by; Show us something to regret, leave us where we lie: Show us growths of crimson cloud that lean on mossy glades; Airs that move below the leaves, making lights and shades; Wonders hiding in the depth, while the glory fades: Show us shafts of golden Hope that soar across the blue; Darkness fleeing softly with no footprints on the dew; Silence waiting, full of songs, till the Dawn break through; Faces twain that meet and pass as if they had not met; Eyes that woo the world but have not known each other yet, Softly heartless as they glance, âwe see and we forget.â Meeting next with doubtful looks, a little grieved and stirred, (O! how the caverns murmur ere the coming wind is heard!) Fixing gaze and rising blush, a birth without a word. Why must new Hope be ever born in troubles and in fears? Why must the grey cloud rise and break before the Day appears? Why breaks it into bliss for some, and why for some in tears? The cloud is hence, the time is come, the old Delight begun! Shine Heaven, and listen Earth, because once more two hearts are one, Once more the world grows beautiful in Love's unsetting sun. O faces, can you be the same? was all this light concealed? O eyes, what have you looked upon? what founts have been unsealed? O world, art thou created fresh? or art thou but revealed? Let us behold you near before you pass into the night; O faces, let us see you well because you are so bright; Lying in the shadow, let us watch the light! TWO JOURNEYS. Under the straight, still Indian sun Went forth a pompous train, To see some due obeisance done For England's name and reign. Gaily the leader stooped and smiled Over his young wife's breast, For there she hid her firstborn child With a whispered âRest, love, rest!â Through shining tracts of silk and gold, Through courts that spread and blaze, Like vast flowers opening, fold by fold, Into a world of rays. Through dream-tints such as swim and float O'er eyes that shut sun-blind, Through air that feels each trumpet note Rush through it like a wind; Between live walls of swarthy eyes Proudly the rulers march, The pale sweep of the sultry skies Was their triumphal arch. But the babe saw only that white breast Wherein it softly lay, And heard the whisper, âRest, love, rest!â And knew not night from day. No hint from swarthy lip or eye Betrayed the brooding crime; O wife, young wife, make haste to die Before you see that time! Never a minute to kiss and part When her true lord was slain, She set her babe against her heart Before it broke in twain; And she hid by day, and by night she fled From that unholy place, Where to the skies her tombless dead Looked up with silent face. When she came to the long sea-sand, Down she sat and sighed. âHusband, husband, reach your hand! Would that I too had died! âOh, never for me the dawn will rise But I shall see that day When the cruel sunbeams smote your eyes, And they did not shrink away. âAnd through the night I shall always hear My horse's hurrying feet, And the shudders of my ceaseless fear, And my babe's low breathing sweet; âAnd all the sounds and all the sights Till the kind hour when I die Shall thrust those dreadful days and nights In the wounds of memory.â But the babe saw only that white breast Wherein it softly lay, And heard the whisper, âRest, love, rest!â And knew not night from day. Oh, must not mother-love be strong To cover its darling thus? Is there never an angel clasp and song To do as much for us? ON THE DEATH OF PRINCE ALBERT. Out of a tomb the world's hope went of old, While angels shone around, Force shrank away, And weeping Love, eternally consoled, Went back to labour in the light of day; And still about our graves our hopes are rife; Thence the remembrance of a noble life Starts like a resurrection. Seal and crown Are set on honour there. We trust the dead; But living hands tear their own banners down, And leave us kingless, sighing to be led. And oft, when living tongues but mourn or rave, Unanswerable accents from the grave Utter decrees of patience. Let us hear Those accents now. Softer they could not be, Calming both grief and joy; for both are near, And in this placid lake of memory Both gaze, and grow more pure by what they see, And, not forgetting, to their toils depart, Each with a gathered flower upon the heart. Well may those weeping eyes which once have seen A perfect thought fulfil itself in deeds, Dwell only on the days that might have been, And watch the form, more bright as it recedes. She asks no painter's skill; the sun may strike His sternest image, let it but be like. Nothing was there to soften or to hide, And nothing to regret, save that he died. No gain can match the glory of her loss; It lights the future, where she walks alone, Not pausing, not afraid to bear her cross, Borne by a thousand hands, yet still her own. WHAT HEAREST THOU? What hearest thou? I hear hearts break, One or two, here and there; Cries to the dead, who do not wake; Prayers, but no answer to prayer; Words that smite and sting; Wrongs that only weep; Weak Truth wearily murmuring, As she tosses in her sleep. Woe to thee! Hast thou found Nothing else under the sun? The wheels of life go fiercely round, But they bear the goddess on. What hearest thou? I hear Earth shout; Summer leaps from her lap; Songs have girt her about; Never a silent gap; Tongues whisper âRejoiceâ In every flower that glows; Love's triumphant voice In every wind that blows. Wings are on thy feet, A trumpet fills thine ears; Thou hearest thine own heart beat, And thou hast not time for tears. What hearest thou? I hear what the cloud Says, kissing the hill; The Future restless and loud, The Past reproachful and still; Worlds in the air that send Echoes to my frail lute; Ah, though I love you, friend, Touch me not and be mute. True thy music and fine, Sweeter would it seem If a hand were clasped in thine, E'en though it broke thy dream. What hearest thou? I hear God speak, It is the only sound, Through clamour, sob, and shriek, As the fierce wheels go round; Words I hardly hear, Dark and faint and few; One thing only is clear, That which I must do. Follow that voice to-night, Ask not where nor how; It once said, âLet there be light,â Darkness waits for it now. THE FUTURE. A figure wanders through my dreams And wears a veil upon its face, Still bending to my breast it seems, Yet ever turns from my embrace. And sometimes, passing from my sight, It lifts the veil as it departs, And eyes flash out with such a light As never dawned on waking hearts. There is no need of sound or speech Or toiling through the troubled years, The rapture of that smile can teach More than a century of tears. And this I know, if it could move Out of my dreams into my days, One service of unbroken love Should fill and crown my life with praise. Love with no doubts and no demands, But generous as a southern June,â Vast brotherhood of hearts and hands, Choir of a world in perfect tuneâ No shallow sunset-films to gild Far summits which we dare not climb, But ceaseless charms of hope fulfilled, Making a miracle of time. How sure, how calm, the picture seems! How near it comes, beheld, possessed! It is not only in my dreams I feel that touch upon my breast. It thrills me through the barren day, It holds me in the heart of strife, No phantom-grasp that melts away, It seemsâit isâthe touch of Life! We look into the heart of flowers And wonder whence their bloom can rise; The secret hope of human hours Is hidden deeper from our eyes. In helpless tracts of wind and rain The work goes on without a sound; And while you weep your weak âIn vain,â The flower is growing underground. We know the lesson; but a cry, Bitter and vast, is in our ears; One life of fruitless misery Shakes all our wisdom into tears. Thronged by the clamorous griefs that say, âBehold what is, forget what seems,â I can but answer, âWelladay; There is that figure in my dreams.â EREMOS AND EUDÃMON. Some souls go broadly up and down the world, Plucking full-fruited joys, and some are set Like trees that spread their unrepining arms About the gentle air, endure the storm, Enrich themselves with luxury of leaves, Grow to the light, persuade all passing birds, And see the seasons pass them and are still; And some are captives, with a square of sky In a blank wall, their sole sad heritage Of the world's beauty. Unto such the stars Are precious, and the phantom-walk of clouds That ruffle no blue smoothness where they move, And all the marshalled silences of light, Warmth, darkness, dew, that make the growth of time, And winds that sing of liberty and distance, And tall grass-blooms, or air-blown chance of leaves, Whereby, as by strong argument, they learn That forests are which they shall never see. So they, like men who stand upon a cliff To watch the far keel trace in lucent fields Its long dim groove, imagine all the course Which they behold not, and desire their dreams. Eremos, in my parable, had watched For half a life the slow secluded years, Which gave him nothing, but received from him The fragments of those fine capacities That broke ere they were filled. Yet he lived on, And was afflicted by his inward strength Finding no outlet through the grey restraints That closed him round. But when the rush of youth Was past, and every pulse of hope had ceased, There came a stillness such as torrents leave In hollows by their course, smooth water-nests, Where ferns may brood and foam-bells linger long, And a whole delicate blossom-world may grow In breezeless leisure on unfretted banks. Then woke a second dawn of hope,âa hope Coveting nothing,âenergies of patience,â A brooding patience that developes life In narrow limits and from little things, Discerning in its corner of the earth All powers and possibilities of being. As one long listening to a winded horn Hears the whole birth of music, while another Hears but the scant soon-ended monotone, So grew his senses quick. On his bare walls The shadows told him how transparently They lie where lawns are greenest; to his ears The distant dropping murmur of a brook Revealed the roar of ocean; the great sky Consoled him with its glory; and his heart Knew the first hidden softness in the wind Against his cheek, and woke to faith in summer. Appeased by this long courage, Circumstance Mutely began to drop into his days Some momentary jewels; first, a seed, Which, resolutely nursed, became a rose, And, fainting not among the prison airs, Beset him with the pleasure of its growth, Until it seemed his soul; for in his soul Each tender tiny promise of a bud Struck such a pang of joy. It talked to him As infants to new mothers,âwith its face, Breath, blushes, kisses,âlovely modes of life Needing no words. He tended it by day, And saw its stature rise to his caress As if it stood on tiptoe till he stooped; And his night-dreams were fragrant with it. There Daily vicissitudes of light and air Were hopes and dangers in a long romance, Whereof his flower was heroine, and himself The slave who lived to shield and cherish her. This was not all. Across the narrow space Through which the sky beheld him, many shapes Began to pass,âwomen and men with hearts, Free steps, and large horizons. As they went To various aims of labour or delight, Some saw the lonely man and were content To grace him with the leisure of a pause. His still thought moved to meet them,âcapable, Impulsive, sympathetic. Now, at last, O! now, at last, EudÃ¦mon came to him And told him of the universe. EudÃ¦mon, A king of life, who never knew a grief. Under the tearless sunshine of his face Some feeble things might fade; but, too much light Is not a common evil in the world; Call it a welcome danger, veil your eyes, But never wish the sun quenched! 'Tis no lamp To read by, but a fire to feed the spheres. Growth should be more than reading. The mere sight Of such august consistency in bliss Was to the gazer strength. âThis is a man,â He said, âand I, the captive, am a man. The seed which angels set becomes a tree, But each lost germ that dwindles into dust Was born a future tree. I will be proud Of what I might have been if the great seasons Had made no compact to destroy me.â Thus He argued; but affection followed fast, Outstripping reason, grasping her cold hand, Lifting her up to unacknowledged heights Where the feet sink in fragrance, and far earth Seems luminous and placid as a sky. He loved EudÃ¦mon; all his frost-bound springs Were loosened in this summer, and spread forth Into a ceaseless river. Never think, O! never think, EudÃ¦mon's heart was cold! He went not like the others; he returned, Leaned through the casement, answered love with love, Gave himself largely, spoke his wonder out, Changing, so said he, coins for virgin gold; And grew so generous in his gratitude, You might have thought him evermore in debt. So in unwearied converse passed the hours. If one had gathered through a wider space, The other brought his pearls from such a deep That you must practise diving all your life If you would reach it. When EudÃ¦mon talked From tropic pageantries to polar glooms, Or told what cities suffer, do, and think, Making a banquet of his garnered stores To tempt his friend, that other ate and drank, Alert, insatiate, joyful. Afterwards, Not roughly, but in some mild natural pause, He asked,âO brother, have you seen the moon?â âAy, friendâ (amazedly), âsome thousand times.â âBut do you know the moon?â Eremos said, And then revealed such wonders of the moon, Such fine suggestions, such eventful clouds, Such long gradations of remembered change Wrought with slow touches, every touch a truth, That, while he spoke, lifting astonished palms. âNay, on my soul, I never learned the moon!â EudÃ¦mon cried; âI prithee tell me more.â So each to each gave honour and delight, One with no need, the other needing all, Yet seemed the richer soul to gain the most, Being eloquent with wide comparisons; While he, who scarcely felt a joy before, Was shy with his new glory and confused, Holding his breath to watch it. So the spring Flowed into breadths of summer and was still; And summer's passionate arms gave up the world Out of their clasp, and autumn carried it With pomp of splendid sorrow to its grave, Where the white silence covers it for long, But not for ever, and the friends were blessed. Then Time, the powerful enemy, who keeps His surest shaft till it can wound the most, Gave his dark signal, and EudÃ¦mon went. O! what unequal pain in that farewell! Grieving he went, but warm expectancy Dried the scarce-fallen tears, and the quick hand, Loosing its strong regretful hold, reached up After new gifts of life. But in the cell Was tumult and resistance and despair. For many days before the day of fate Each momentary joy became a terror Coming to say, âI go;â and all the while, By night, by day, one never-answered thought Roamed up and down, a caged and furious wish Seeking release, âWhat can I do for him? O brother, benefactor, saviour, friend, What can I do for thee?â There was no room For the other thought, âHow can I live without him?â Which some might deem more natural; but this love Had made an end of self. So, even at last, When the hearts brake asunder and the hands Shrank from and then prolonged the final clasp, The same unanswerable wish arose, âO! for my comfort, can I give him nothing? Can I do nothing for him?ââWith a spring Like one on whom a revelation breaks, Leaving no choice, he caught his growing rose (A slender plant) and plucked it by the roots, And laid it on that deprecating breast Ere the vain gesture checked him. âFor my sake.â He cried, âreceive it. If I give not all, I have given nothing. Nothing now to me Is all I had. Only the thought of you Shall fill and cover every part of life; And when I know my rose has died with you, Its unforgotten bloom shall comfort me More than its presence.â With that word they parted, And he that went was blind with gentle tears, Tender with kind regrets, and not forgetful, But constant, speaking much across the seas, And telling where he went and what he did And how he loved, and sending gifts and flowers And all atonements possible for pangs Which cannot be appeased. But he that stayed Wept little and sat still, watching his dead With that sad vigilance which only ceases When the grave shuts. We know what follows Death. Why, even in happy households such a loss Strikes all the music from our daily talk, Nay, half the language; for we use not freely Words full of memory. He looked no more For change or hope or comfort. He sat still. In all his life was nothing but this loss. Years melted, and EudÃ¦mon came again. The links of that long chain across the sea Had dwindled; for the periodic task Of written talk is hard to many hearts; Few only warm it with such living breath That it becomes a voice. The links had failed; But with his first light spring upon the shore He caught the broken chain and hurried on, Love in his face and tokens in his hands And histories on his lips,âto cast them all Upon the turf of a forgotten grave. He filled the winds with sorrow. âHere lies one Who loved me with immeasurable love, Giving me all he had. O, see your rose! Will you not stretch your hand to take your rose? I have it on my heart. You have not known How I remembered you. Your days were cold And your death lonely. I am come at last, But that âToo lateâ which slays the souls of men Has sundered us for ever.â One stood by And, partly understanding why he wept, Gave him this comfort: âHave you brought a rose (I think you said so) to this flowerless grave? The poor soul murmured much about a rose Before he died, and once I heard him say How, through the long mist of his many griefs, He saw one moment of such pure delight That all the distant Past was bright with it,â The moment when he gave away a rose. I know not what he meant; I saw him smile When that remembrance settled on his face, And, with the smile upon his lips, he died.â LADY GRACE. A Drama, IN FIVE ACTS. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. MEN.

Cranston writing at a table.âServant attending. CRANSTON, looks up. This is for Lord Lynton. I am sorry that I cannot go to him sooner, but the whole morning is engaged. SERVANT. So I told him, Sir. CRANSTON. You showed Mr. De Courcy and Miss Wiimot into the private room? SERVANT. Yes, Sir; half an hour ago. CRANSTON. Have they anything to amuse them? SERVANT. Only cigars, Sir. CRANSTON. Cigars!âfor both? SERVANT. The young lady said, Sir, as she had often wished to smoke, and now she'd try, and the gentleman said he'd teach her. CRANSTON. Very good. I'll receive Lady Grace here. (Bell rings.) See if she has arrived. (Exit Servant.) Now this rich widow. I, who am the son Of her sire's steward, have not seen her face Since it looked up at me through childish tears; I see the leafy light across it now As she stood deep i' the moss, while I, aloft, Shook all the hazels. 'Twas a fair face thenâ But morn is fair on every face. Mine, too, Touched by that early lustre of the woods, MightâPshaw! I am glad my name is changed since then; I do not wish her to remember me. (Servant announces Lady Grace Aumerle.âEnter Lady Grace, in the deepest mourning. Her manner is very haughty.) CRANSTON, aside. The echo of her sobs is three years old, Methinks it might be fainter! LADY GRACE, drawing back, Sir, your pardon. I thought this was the lawyer's private room. CRANSTON. Madam, it is. LADY GRACE. But thenâWhere is the lawyer? CRANSTON. Here, Madam. LADY GRACE. Not the clerk. I seek your master. CRANSTON. He is not here. LADY GRACE. He was appointed here To meet me at this hour. Where loiters he? CRANSTON. I cannot tell you, for I never saw him. LADY GRACE. Some blunder frets me; I must summon patience Till it is cleared. (More courteously) Write, Sir; I'll not disturb you. (Seats herself.) CRANSTON, advancing. Forgive me, Lady Graceâ (she starts and looks displeased) You think me young, But I am all the master in this house. Work hath a heavier tread than Time. I seem An old man to myself. LADY GRACE, looking at him. You cannot be Theâpersonâwho conducted our affairsâ Who was much trustedâand who gave advice; I think you could not give advice? CRANSTON, smiling. I sell it, Like other men of law. LADY GRACE. Ten years agoâ (You were at school then)â CRANSTON. Were you married then? LADY GRACE. I am not here to answer questions. CRANSTON. Nay, Your pardon; questions are the seed of law, Without them we are fruitless. If you need My poor but ready service, you must yield The pearls I dive for,âlet them be true gems, Or you'll not like their setting. LADY GRACE. Sir, I think You play with me. I am a womanâtroubledâ Walking without a staff where I was used To feel an arm about me. I am here For counsel from white hairs and practised wits, Known to my house by years of rendered service, To me more briefly, but yet certainly; And you, who talk to me of fruit,âyour thoughts Are covered with the useless bloom of youth, We know not what they shall be. CRANSTON. What they are Your husband knew (forgive the needed pain!), And was content. My alphabet was law, I lisped it ere I walked. This house's head Took me a child, and trained and trusted me, Clerk, pupil, partner, heir. I was yet a boy When first your lord, a stately gentleman, Sought counsel at our hands; he talked with me, Liked me, and asked for me again,âI wearing His notice like a crown. As years went on I had his hope and honour in my hands By many a pledge, till now, our chief being dead, I, whom he gave his office and his name, Have his experience, too, and without help, Rule prosperous affairs. If you doubt still, I'll bring you written witness. LADY GRACE. This suffices. I see that you are older than you look; You show it when you speak. Then you know all? CRANSTON. More than yourself, perhaps. I know you are ricl, A queen, upon conditions. That you hold Sway over two, your husband's niece and nephew, Whom you have never seen, though their long future Lies in your grasp; according to your will You give them all or nothing. LADY GRACE. Are they here? CRANSTON. They wait your summons. LADY GRACE. I would prove the children. I am old myselfâyou smileâI have done with life; I trace its mazes from a toilsome height, And can guide others. CRANSTON, shaking his head. You can point the way. Light for shut eyes is darkness. LADY GRACE. It may shine So softly that you cannot choose but look To see what tender thing has tempered it. I mean, Sir, to make goodness beautiful. CRANSTON. You can do that. LADY GRACE. It should not need the doing; But beauty unperceived is music dumb. I want to show these hearts what virtue is, That they may love it. CRANSTON. Ay, and what is virtue? LADY GRACE. You will not find it in the world; it grows Most often from a grave, and blossoms best When foreheads that it should have crowned are cold, And eyes that longed for it are blind for ever. CRANSTON. Why, so it is with fame and so with love. It is the law of life that life should cease Before its end is gained. LADY GRACE. A bitter law, Which I accept not for these two young hearts. I have them in the bud; I have the morning, The generous To be. Mine to fulfil, To train, guard, guerdon. Should we hide our past In our own bosoms? Mine I mean to set At the root of their fresh future. They shall grow Out of my kind decay, and come to fruit Just when I wither. CRANSTON. I'll not threaten you With stormy noons or cankered flowers, ill growth By purest nourishment. I'll say you seek What cannot be; you sign the doom of Hope Before her trial. The form is in the seed; You nourish what you know not. In the dark, Deliberate crystals mould themselves by laws Unchangeable and uncommunicable. Strive not to stretch one angle half a hair; You can but break it. Let the children go. The noon of your own life is still to come. LADY GRACE. Past, past! CRANSTON. You cheat yourself with words; you toll Before a death, and music of new health Shall ring the funeral strain to silence. LADY GRACE. Sir, You are bold. We'll speak of this no more. I came Not for myself. I wish (myself unseen) To see these children; can you find a means? CRANSTON. Madam, I'll show you, in my private room, A chink i' the wall. It was my master's office, And he was one who loved to play the spy Upon his servants. LADY GRACE. It is well. I thank you. I want to read their faces while you tell My project for their lives. CRANSTON. I know not yet What is your project. LADY GRACE, giving a paper. It is written here. (He opens it.) Nay, do not read it now; the time cries haste. (He folds it up.) Yet, if you wishâ CRANSTON. Madam, I have no wishes; I am an instrument for doing work. LADY GRACE. I did not say so. CRANSTON. No? I am too bold To think you graced me with so much observance, I'll leave you for a moment. I must see A clear way to your ambush. Wait me here. (He is going; she follows him to the door.) LADY GRACE. I did not mean to wound you. CRANSTON. O you charm The sting out of the wound. (Exit.) LADY GRACE, alone. A fitful man, With histories in his eyes. I would not pain him; I should win him for my friend, that he may work With me in this new field. A lawyer's clerk! Impossible for friendship! Yet, I know not,â I do not think he is a common man. He will not help me. No man helps a woman Unless he loves her; therefore women use To win the hearts they do not care to keep, For service' sake, not love's. I could not do it. I hold a heart as sacred as a soul, Living or lost for ever. I must fill My place alone. These young ones whom I love, They must be full of fine capacities And noble chances; all things are at first. The boys and girls who weary me with life, Who mock its toils and make its glory gossip, Had futures in them once. Why died the light On the day's threshold? Something slew it there; Some breath from a base fact which poisoned it Ere it had come to strength. Life shrank and fell Before it felt the undying kiss of truth. These I can shelter; theseâ CRANSTON, re-entering. I'll lead you, Madam, Into your hiding place. LADY GRACE. I follow you. (Exeunt.) SCENE II. âA Room in Cranston's House. Captain de Courcy lies back in an easy-chair, smoking a cigar. âRosa sits on a footstool at his feet, with a cigar between her lips.â Silence for a little while.âThere is a partition down one side of the stage, showing a small side chamber, into which Cranston and Lady Grace enter.âHe shows her the aperture through which she is to look.âShe sees, starts, and turns to him with an expression of dismay.âHe smiles and shakes his head. CRANSTON, aside. No harm, a frolic only. LADY GRACE. Ay, a frolic. I'll not be harsh. DE COURCY, taking the cigar out of his mouth and laughing. Cosa stupenda! brava! That lasted a full minute. ROSA. By my watch (Holding up her watch.) It lasted twice the time. Is this the way? (She puffs out the smoke.) DE COURCY. Superb! ROSA. I don't much like it. DE COURCY, eagerly. But you will. Habit is all the world in everything. Few have the gift, but all can persevere Till they achieve it. I myself at first Had shrinkings; now, I tell you, I can smoke Ten hours a day. ROSA. Delicious! DE COURCY. O, it smooths The edge of time so sweetly. Hours slip on; You are awake, and I suppose things happen, But you don't know what happens; you just feel A general sense of happening. Nothing hurts you. I think your dearest friend might die at your feet, And you,âof course you would be sorry, yet You would not be uncomfortably sorry. There lies the beauty of it. ROSA. O, you men! You are such misers in your privilege You hardly let us share it as an alms. DE COURCY. Why, thankless childâ ROSA. O yes, you teach it me; But would you teach your wife? DE COURCY. Humâahâmy wife.â ROSA. I know you would not. DE COURCY. Well, I think I would not; You seeâone's wifeâthere's all the differenceâ One's wife must never be a theme of talk; She must not be a Person, she's a Wife (I think the Bible says so); she must stay At home while we go out, and be content Under all changes, and make no demands. ROSA. But why not smoke at home? DE COURCY. Well, well, she must not. 'Tis clear. It is the nature of the thing. One does not want one's wife to steep herself In such unvexed composure. ROSA, mimicking him. No, one does not; One wants to make one's wife uncomfortable Just now and then, for a change. DE COURCY. You twist my meaning. ROSA. Cousin de Courcy, I must tell you this, I never should have guessed from what I see, You men were better than we women are If'twere not set down as a certain fact In sermons and the âSaturday Review.â LADY GRACE, aside. The child has wit. CRANSTON. Not edgeless. By your leave I'll make a third. Time presses. (Exit Cranston.) Scene III. Captain de Courcy, Rosa. To them, Cranston. CRANSTON. I am afraid I have made you wait. DE COURCY. We have not needed patience. ROSA. Now that's a compliment. My courteous cousin, You grow more polished while I look at you. CRANSTON. While? or because? ROSA. O, pardonâI forgot you. (To De Courcy) Talk to him, cousin. DE COURCY. I'll exert myself. Rosa, I think this is a time for men. (To Cranston.) Now, Sir, you sent for us; we are not used To come at summons, but we understood This was from Lady Grace; and we are bound In a certain senseâthat is, not bound, but yet Bound in a certain senseâto do her pleasure; That is, we see not why we should not do it, And, in a certain sense, I meanâ CRANSTON. I see. And Lady Grace, who speaks to you by me, Has charged me to make known her purposes. DE COURCY, quickly. What is her purpose? CRANSTON. You shall hear it now. I am to read this paper. (Cranston unfolds a paper. They draw eagerly up to him. He reads.) âI have determined to make a home for my niece and nephew, Miss Wilmot and Captain de Courcy, and to treat them in all respects as if they were my own children, and I hope that they will try to think of me as of a mother,ââ DE COURCY, twisting his moustache. I'm not so fond of mothers! ROSA. O, for shame! DE COURCY. I mean no harmâthey're very well for daughters, But men should have no mothers. They're a tie; You can't forget them; 'tis as though you had Your boots (good boots) just half an inch too tight, A trifling obstacle to all you do. Regulars are oppressiveâvolunteers Intolerable. ROSA. I'm content. I find My doings and my goings often checked For lack of the convenience of a chaperon; Not that I feel the need. DE COURCY. She may control you. ROSA. Well, she may try. CRANSTON. Your pardon; I'll read further. (Aside) I count the pulses of that listening heart. (Reads) âI do not wish to exercise any restraint upon them,ââ ROSA, interrupts. That frightens me. Fair promises of freedom Come ever most from tyrants. DE COURCY. I can hear The clank of fetters. Go the way you choose, But this is mine and I like company; Keep your own hours, I'll wait for you at meals, Sit up for you at nights, and never scold, But only sigh and shake my head at you; Read what you like, but tell me why you like it; Spend as you please, but let me see the bills.â Maternal liberty! ROSA. Let's hear the end. CRANSTON, reads. âI do not wish to exercise any restraint upon them, and the only condition which I desire to impose is that they should be perfectly open with me. I hope to enter as much as possible into their pursuits, and I wish them in return to enter into mine. There are to be no concealments between them and me. I shall resent nothing but deception, and I trust that as we learn to know each other we shall be happy together.â (As Cranston reads, his voice expresses increasing dissatisfaction.) CRANSTON, aside. Hope, leaning on a menace, can but fall. O, woman, you were sleeping in a wood And dreaming of a city! Human souls Cannot be set in nosegays. DE COURCY. Now it's out! Confound me if I join in her pursuits! ROSA. It need not trouble you, because you cannot. I shall be set to darning! or, perhaps, Reading to sick old folks, or teaching children. DE COURCY. We men can read. ROSA. Not well. DE COURCY. She might begin With our pursuits, as we are two to one,â I'll teach her smoking. ROSA. And I'll make her hunt. (To Cranston) O, Sir, you know this aunt, describe her to us. CRANSTON. I only saw her once. ROSA. An hour's enough. I know a new man in a minute. You, Being a lawyer, must read faces. Tell us What hers told you. CRANSTON. A language with no teacher, Clear in itself. A sorrowful short poem Sung in the twilight to a fevered man, Making him dream of peace. (Enter Lady Grace. They start and appear confused.) SCENE IV. Lady Grace, De Courcy, Rosa, Cranston. LADY GRACE, advancing. I have stayed too long. (Aside. (Aloud.) Children, forgive me! I remember nothing That I have heard. CRANSTON. Nothing? LADY GRACE. I said so, Sir. (To the others.) O, do not look ashamed, you show my fault. Youth's privilege is mocking what it knows not; But when you know me,âif I win your love (And I shall try for't), you may stand amazed, Like one who shoots a shaft in Fairyland And finds a burst of blossoms where it struck. DE COURCY. MadamâI would say, Aunt,âwe did not mean, That is, we meant but in a certain sense,â We hope, that is to say, we fearâ ROSA, taking Lady Grace's hand. I don't. I see at once you have delicious eyes, And I'll be fond of you. LADY GRACE. I'll not deceive you; I am a beggar for your love. Give alms Of its untested plenty, only alms; You must not squander; you must save for claims Stronger than mine; but I may quench my thirst, Yet leave the source untouched. ROSA. The source? LADY GRACE. Your heart. It lies so deep you have not looked at it. A master hand shall find it. ROSA. Or find out That there is no such thing. I had a heart And a doll at five years old. I played with them Till I out-grew such trifles. Who can tell Under what dust of broken toys they lie? Let no man dig them out; I should not know them. LADY GRACE. I would I had known you ere that heart was lost. DE COURCY. O Aunt, she talksâ LADY GRACE. I do not judge by words. ROSA. There, you had best be dumb! DE COURCY. I tell you, Rosa, It is a time for men. LADY GRACE, looking timidly at them. We are yet strangers, But we shall grow familiar in our home. I want you to say home. ROSA. H, o, m, e, You see I can spell it. DE COURCY. Aunt, she does but jest. ROSA. I'm published with a key, like a boy's Ovid; Let me translate myself. DE COURCY, aside to Rosa. You are unwise; Please her at first, that you may please yourself For ever afterwards. ROSA. O politic man! (Servant announces Lady Grace Aumerle's carriage.) LADY GRACE. You'll come with me? (She takes Captain de Courcy's arm.) Thanks, nephew. I am gay With such a cavalier. (As they go out they remember Cranston, who has silently watched the last scene; they bow to him.) LADY GRACE. Good morning, Sir. (Cranston bows gravely. Exeunt Lady Grace, Rosa, and De Courcy.) CRANSTON. Forgotten like her glove, which she picks up Without a thought! Why sent she not her lackey to farewell me? The music of her lips was never meant For a lawyer's clerk. O hand, O little hand, You have not graced me with a passing touch; But you may be closed in such a mighty clasp That you have not room to quiver! I have seen Nothing so lovely since I saw the morn Blaze through a purple Apennine, and weave The world into a garment for its glory. We see such pictures now and then, and know That somewhere upon earth there lives a face Meet to be set in them. Well, I have found it! END OF ACT FIRST. ACT II. SCENE I. âCranston's Office. Lady Grace, Captain de Courcy, Cranston, seated at a table with writing materials. CRANSTON. And this is all? LADY GRACE. He tells me it is all; I am sure his word is true. DE COURCY. O, have no fears! If in your bounty you release me now, I know the weight and weariness of debt, And shall eschew it. LADY GRACE. Promise not too much; Only be true with me. I cannot measure The height of your temptations. DE COURCY. There it is. You cannot know how life besets a fellow. You women have no wants;âat least, I mean You women do so happily without The things you want. We, who are men, must have them; And therefore, meaning well, we spend too much Against our will, because we cannot help it. But, I'll be careful now. LADY GRACE. I am sure you will. (To Cranston.) Give me the paper. (Cranston places a paper before her and stands behind her chair, pointing over her shoulder.) CRANSTON. Here you write your name. LADY GRACE, signs it. I am glad my little name can do so much. CRANSTON. It can do all. (She looks up.) I mean no mystery; 'Tis the name ever, writ below the page, That gives the page its force. The words that heal Or wound, from one, are, if another sign them, Merely a gust of vacant syllables. LADY GRACE, giving Captain de Courcy the paper. There, nephew; not a sound,âI'll have no thanks; Only be true to me. DE COURCY, kissing her hand. I were too false For pity, were I false to you. LADY GRACE, to Cranston. My thanks Are largely yours, for all your words were help Which the kind utterance doubled. In your hands I have left (you know it) twice the sum there told; (She touches the paper.) And, in your presence, let my nephew hear He may draw it when he needs it,âhe, the judge, Not I, nor you; you counselled me to trust him, And thus I follow counsel. I'll not know When it is spent, nor how; I'll only pray you (To Captain de Courcy.) To spend it with a little nobleness. There are such mighty wants in all the world To wring our human pleasures from our grasp! Give something for a cause, not all for self, Which, being pampered, suffers. So, farewell. (Exit Lady Grace.) DE COURCY. More thanks than language holds! A fair escape; Only a text; it might have been a sermon. Well, she's a generous woman. (To Cranston.) Now the money. CRANSTON. You have it in your hand. DE COURCY. Ay, but the rest. You heard the lady; neither when nor how Will she inquire the fashion of the giving; So let the when be now; the how, in notes, Crisp, clean, and cheery Bank of England notes. Well, Sir? CRANSTON. I heard you say your debts were paid. This hasteâ DE COURCY. Pshaw, man, there is no harm in haste. One cannot tell a woman all one's debts. Go, you're a man of the world. CRANSTON, turning on him sharply. No, I am not,â Not of your world. Mine has another manner, And keeps a thought of honour in its heart. There, take your gold. (Pushes a portfolio to him and sits down at the table, turning his back.) DE COURCY, takes the portfolio. The manners of your world Are truly not like mine.(Aside.) I hit him there. These working fellows can't be gentlemen. (Exit.) CRANSTON, alone. Deceived, poor heart! O, if I were thy fate, Thy life should be a lovely melody, Where, to the gentle question of a pause, Some added charm still answers, till the end When all the measured flowing rests at last. It cannot be. Were it but to stretch my hand I must not. I to drag her from her height! Besides I have this letter on my soul, Pressed by her dying lord into my hands. (Takes out a letter and reads.) âIf my wife marries again, as I earnestly desire that she may not, she shall forfeit by the act half her fortune, which shall pass to my nephew, and the other half shall be secured to her second husband for his sole use and behoof. A sealed codicil to this effect is deposited in my lawyer's hands, but I desire that this my determination be kept secret from my wife, and not revealed to her save in the event of her marriage.â 'Twere base to woo her in the dark, I knowing What dawn will show. I am barred from her for ever. Fie, what a jest! I am barred from that which lies Utterly out of reach, and dream I touch it! Yetâyetâwhen last she graced me with a look, I found a tender shadow in her eyes. Nay, if it be so, I must close mine own. I have so much of manhood that I choose Despair betore dishonour. (Exit.) SCENE II. âSmoking-room at a London Club-house. Lord Lynton, Sir George Sandys, Fitzerse, Raymond, Capel, all smoke in silence. LORD LYNTON. You will confess she's handsome. SIR GEORGE. Not my style; A little slow, you see. I like them fast. FITZERSE. I thought no style could come amiss to you. Fast, said you? why, I thought you liked them all. SIR GEORGE. No, on my honour, Ned, I never said so. I may have saidâbut quite in confidenceâ That I'm a little fortunate with all. 'Tis strange, now,âamong friends one speaks the truthâ How good they are to me. I am not vain; I know my faults. I see where others pass me. I've seen a fellow ten times handsomerâ LORD LYNTON. No, no! SIR GEORGE. You laugh. Say twenty times,âwhat matter If I come first to the goal? Crowns are not made For those who grace them, but for those who win them; We, in these wiser days, approve the man More than the vestment. You shall see Adonis Unpartnered, while some bright-tongued Caliban Picks his nice footsteps through a heap of hearts, Lying so close he treads on one or two For want of thought. LORD LYNTON. Poor hearts! SIR GEORGE. Poor man! Believe me There's a sharp sting in finding out too late You have hurt something helpless. Envy not A man so conscienced. FITZERSE. Are there many such? SIR GEORGE. No, by the hopes of women; two or three Sufficing for the world. FITZERSE. One were enough. I wonder what the ladies say of us In their seclusions! SIR GEORGE. Did you never hear? I had the chance once; in a country house, Stalled by good hap next to a gathering-place, Where a whole bevy groomed their golden manes Just before sleep,âair sultryâwindows wideâ I in the balconyâa mist of words Whirling against the moonlight. LORD LYNTON. Fie! you listened. I hope you heard some mischief of yourself. SIR GEORGE. Too much, too much! But honour holds me dumb. FITZERSE. I'll wager what you heard was as a spur To drive you from the house. SIR GEORGE. Some traitor told you. I went next day. I had no heart to meet Looks which I could not answer. FITZERSE. Pshaw, Sir George! You should say no before they ask, and save them From their own hopes. SIR GEORGE. One cannot always show That one sees through the gauze. Besides, one fears A possible blunder. FITZERSE. Is it possible? SIR GEORGE. Fitzerse, you are young. Time and the world must set Their future polish on your future wit. I, as a friend, advise you,âdo not talk Too freely to a man who has a Past, Lest a smile scathe you. FITZERSE. Thanks; I'm not afraid, Only a little sceptical. SIR GEORGE. You doubt me. LORD LYNTON. Come, come. SIR GEORGE. His doubts are very natural. By what he knows he judges. Me he knows not. Be patient with him, he has time to learn. RAYMOND. Let's hear the lesson, Capel, shall we not? Now, Sandys! CAPEL. Now, Fitzerse! FITZERSE. I have said nothing. SIR GEORGE. We know it, man; say something nowâwe listen. Proclaim your vast experience! FITZERSE. What I think I say, of you, or any man,ânot more Of you than of another. RAYMOND AND CAPEL. Hear, hear, hear! FITZERSE. O, you may laugh. I stand by what I say. SIR GEORGE. Dear fellow, stand by it, but say it first! FITZERSE. I thinkâand this is what I meant to sayâ Men scorned by women speak of women lightly, As you of Lady Grace. SIR GEORGE. She could not scorn, Being unsought. I do not like the lady. She may be fair, but she has preaching eyes, And I breathe no Amens. Her niece, I grant you, Is drawn with softer touches. FITZERSE. I am sure You have not found her so. SIR GEORGE. Be not too rash In such assurance. FITZERSE, to the others. Do not listen to him. He may be king of thousands, but this one (I chance to know it) sits at liberty. SIR GEORGE. You know it? FITZERSE, I have said so. SIR GEORGE, Knowledge lies In consciousness, which makes itself a fact Unto itself, but seen in clearer light May be but half a fact, more false in use Than a whole falsehood. FITZERSE. Talk your metaphysics To other ears. I speak of what I know. I had the lady's tablets at a ball To hide them from this happy gentleman, Lest he should write his name there. LORD LYNTON. By her wish? FITZERSE. I never yet forestalled a lady's wishes, Nor thwarted them. SIR GEORGE. Ah, dear Fitzerse, you have learnt Hardly the alphabet of women's ways; Those pretty idioms where two noes make yes You cannot read. A wish? A blind, a blind, Transparent to a scholar. FITZERSE. Do you think She wished to dance with you? SIR GEORGE. I know she did. FITZERSE, And hid her tablets! SIR GEORGE. Could I sue for them Having them in my hand? It is so sweet To be entreated. FITZERSE. But she danced not with you! SIR GEORGE. There I reproach myself. LORD LYNTON. Oh, she'll forgive it. SIR GEORGE. Her pardon pressed so close upon my fault There was no space for seemly penitence. See now, Fitzerse, you doubt me. Shall I prove More than I hint? FITZERSE. Prove anything you like. LORD LYNTON. What, champion, you draw back? FITZERSE. Not for a moment I'll swear he can prove nothing. SIR GEORGE, becoming animated. I will prove That she lies at my mercy, that I hold her So balanced on the hair-broad edge of fancy That at my word, my will, my look, she falls, Taken or left at pleasure. FITZERSE. Be ashamed Of such a boast! SIR GEORGE. That would I, were it boasting. CAPEL. But who shall judge? SIR GEORGE. Fitzerse himself! I'll stand By his award. My proof shall be as loud As a great school-bell, thrusting its âToo late!â On breathless culprits, who excuse themselves But venture no denial. RAYMOND. Bravely said. No fairer test could be devised. CAPEL. But time; Name us some limit; spin not miles of web To snare one butterfly. SIR GEORGE. Oh, time's a trifle. What's to-day? Thursday; and I'm booked tomorrow For Greenwich. Soâsoâcan you keep your patience Till Monday? FITZERSE. Pshaw! SIR GEORGE. I know it's rather long; But these dear creatures want a little time. I could not do it quicker. Hurry business, Sentiment, never! FITZERSE. Curse your sentiment! SIR GEORGE. And welcome. Will you take a bet? FITZERSE. I scornâ RAYMOND AND CAPEL, interrupting. Come, come, you fear. FITZERSE. Not I! I'll take his bet Twenty times reckoned, stretched through twenty weeks, And am so sure of his defeat I'll venture Double the sum with you or you or you, Any or all. ALL. Hear, hear! (Sir George takes out his tablets and writes.) FITZERSE. What have you written? SIR GEORGE, reads. âI engage to prove, to the satisfaction of these witnesses, by Monday next, that a certain lady, not to be named here, is so far devoted to me that it is manifestly at my choice, not hers, whether I make her my wife or not.â (He looks up.) But this must go no further; keep it close. I would not make a scandal for the world; And I might have to marry her in earnest If you are indiscreet. RAYMOND AND CAPEL. No fear, no fear! SIR GEORGE. On Monday, then? FITZERSE. On Monday I shall see you Wiser and humbler. SIR GEORGE. That's a pious hope. (They take leave. Exeunt all except Sir George Sandys.) SCENE III. Sir George, alone. SIR GEORGE. I never fail, because I never try If failure blurs the distance. I can read This girl as I ride past her. Oh, 'tis plain! Her gods are Change and Notice; out of the light She is torpid. She would sooner writhe than sleep; Sooner be stared at by reproachful eyes Than left unseen. Had she but half a heart She had been lost ere now; but careful nature Has made her cold; and so she walks unscathed, Like those mean things that slip across the brooks, And sink not, for no water touches them. Now, tired of calm, disdaining ill report, Stung by restraint, I find her. I have met Her eyes; I know she holds me for a man Unconquered. I may tempt her by a triumph To some sufficient boldness; then we part, She careless, I content, leaving our names For a week's talk, which might have been a month's On less occasion. Were my life a tale, Told by a dozen honest witnesses, I should not guess the hero. (Exit.) SCENE IV. âLady Grace's Garden. Lawn and croquet-ground with players.âLady Grace and Rosa advance. ROSA. Aunt, you called me. LADY GRACE. I want you for a moment. (Takes her hand.) Did you say You had no secrets? ROSA, aside. If she guesses this I am undone.(Aloud.) Why, if I had a secret I could not keep it for an hour. I talk To everything. If people will not listen, I'd tell it to a bird, a flower, a kitten, And find or fancy sympathy. LADY GRACE. No need For such devisings. I am not a girl, That's true, but not for that you shrink from me. Time has but hidden the girl's heart; it is here, Ready to answer yours. A little way, A few slow steps beyond you on life's path, Still troubled, still in hope, still warm with love, With just a touch of wisdom won from pain, And eyes so bathed in recent memory, That they are quickened for another's care, Forestalling it with pity. Therefore trust me. ROSA. Oh, you are kind, I know it, but you dream Of cares I never felt. LADY GRACE. I can secure That you shall never feel them. Rosa, trust me. If it be joy, none feel another's joy Like those who have for ever lost their own. If grief, I am professor in that school To make its lessons easy. And if hope, Why, even there, I am a match for you; Hope, obstinate and faithful, clings to me, Spurned every hour. ROSA, aside. Heavens, what an interlude For croquet and flirtation! LADY GRACE. I am afraid You think me cold. ROSA. No, no! LADY GRACE. In truth I am not. Try me. I have no coldness for a fault (If such there be), knowing myself; I find No fault a folly of a gentle heart Out of my limits. ROSA. You bewilder me. You have believed some tale to my dispraise. LADY GRACE. I have a letter for you. (Gives a letter.) ROSA. You have read it! LADY GRACE. If my life stood i' the words I could not read them, Being for you. O child, you know me not. ROSA. I did not mean to anger you. You listened To our unconscious talk. LADY GRACE. You shame my soul By the remembrance. It is true, I did, And am unpardoned for it here. ROSA. I know You did it not in malice. You might read To save me from some danger that I love, Or lead me to some good I covet not. But I am glad you did not. Be at ease; Here is this mighty secret. You may read Over my shoulder. (She slips the letter into her pocket while she speaks and exchanges it for another, which she opens and reads, and then holds out to Lady Grace.) Nay, I'll force you to it. (She puts her arm round Lady Grace's waist, and holds the letter before her eyes.) LADY GRACE. Not if your heart says no. ROSA. My heart says nothing. A dumb heart balances a talking tongue, And I've the last. I'll read it. (Reads aloud.) âThe last roses you sent are perfection. Do make two or three dozen more like them if you can spare the time. âEver yours affectionately, âEmma Vane.â Mock flowers to decorate a room. I learnt The trick in France,âland of unreal graces. 'Twas Sir George Sandys gave you this? LADY GRACE. It was. You know they say my figure is like yours. He came behind me in the game and thrust This in my hand, nor knew that he had blundered, Nor I till afterwards. ROSA. And then you wove A fine romance, with me for heroine. Fie, Aunt, you are fanciful. This Emma Vane, My friend, Sir George's cousin, gives a dance, And sends this precious billet to bespeak My help and presence. Do not tell Sir George That he mistook. LADY GRACE. Why not? ROSA. Because he sits At his own feet in worship, and I like To toss a little healthy scorn at him. Leave me my triumph. LADY GRACE. As you will; but, Rosa, How much are you familiar with this man? ROSA. Familiar? Not at all. I dance with him, Bow in the street, talk, isten, and forget Before I sleep. He takes it all for homage. Men ever count their birds before they are shot, And stare when some light skyward waft of wings Shows them unscathed. LADY GRACE. I like him not; he talks As vaguely as a schoolgirl. ROSA. Is that all? You spoke with such a shudder in your eyes I thought you had some crime to charge him with. LADY GRACE. Is it no crime To drop your days like nutshells, having swallowed All that was good in them? They should be seeds Which only fall to grow. Is it no crime Merely to be a man that you may show The slightness and the poverty of life? When life, in a man's hand, is such a sword To cleave the dark assailants of our souls; Such a slow weaving of collected flowers Into a deathless garland; such a clasp Between this world and that which lies beyond, Making both one. ROSA. Oh, never talk to me Of other worlds! I know I should not like them So well as this. I love to wear the flowers Which others pluck for me; and as for swords, I love the uniform, but not the sword; It gets in your way in dancing. LADY GRACE, aside. I do harm With such untimely earnest. This it is To have so little power upon myself. This was my fault, not hers. I scare her from me. (Aloud, with great tenderness.) Dear, I'll not keep you from your pleasure. Go; I'll follow. (Rosa kisses and waves her hand and runs off to the players.) O, how glad she was to go! No partingâan escape. Now has my fault Marred in a word the policy of weeks! I meant to woo her gently, to make sure I stood within the border of her love (I fear I do not), ere I strained her love By plea for any touch of graver thought; Now, like a sear leaf in the flush of June, I thrust sure terror of the death to come Against the face of joy, and am disdained. (Enter Cranston.) Alas! you come in timeâI have failed again! SCENE V. Lady Grace, Cranston. CRANSTON. Such failures are the planks that reach success. Look not so sad. How came it? LADY GRACE. From myself. I went by your advice, held down my heart And spake not with my tongue, and they were tamer. I might have spread my hand with nobler food And caught them in the meshes of a hope; But I sprang out too soon and startled them, And they are fled! CRANSTON. Ay, but they will return. There is no power like patience. LADY GRACE. If you wait While a root grows; but if the earth be blank, What profit that you water it with tears? You may die watching it! CRANSTON. I pray you, pardon! You are, I know not how, of southern mould; You look for souls that can express their dreams, For soil that blossoms, for a wind that warms; We are not so, God has not made us so, Our earth is full of iron, not of wine, Stern summers and grey noons. But you shall find Heroes who are ashamed of noble words; Ay, boys who cannot spell the name of hero, But are what the name covers. LADY GRACE. In my heart I cannot think so. When our land was great Her sons had great desires; they were not content With food and clothing; from no stumbling chance Sprang their achievements, but by natural growth Out of the habit of their daily hope, Ay, and their daily scorn! We women now Have all the aspiration and disdain; We are told we cannot read our masters' souls, And must not know their lives; we must turn away Our decent looks, and leave them to their will, And to their masks and shifts and meannesses; When the need comes, these crawlers shall arise And do the work of heroes. Why, do you think The men who made our England what she is Told lies to their mothers? CRANSTON, taking her hand. Hear me! LADY GRACE. You are a man You should know best. I have heard too much of patience,â Too much of dreary patience. Give me hope! CRANSTON. I have none. LADY GRACE. Seek it! (They look at each other in silence; then she draws away her hand and covers her face. He moves away a little, and then returns.) CRANSTON. Was it not your niece Who struck this passion from you? yet you speak Only of men. I pray you, tell me all. LADY GRACE, controlling herself. The girl is trueâtrue, slight, and frivolous, But on that true foundation we may build A better structure. 'Tis the boy, her cousin, Brings me to this despair. Not for an hour Did I forget myself to be myself, Lest I should gall him. I was gay by force, Placid by violence to my burning thoughts; I strewed my sympathy about his feet, Thankful if he but stooped. He met me well; No sudden homage, not too soft a speech, But with considerate, manly smiles, that seemed Half tolerance, half respect,âwith daily words Such as, âI seem not better than I am;â âI hate professions;â âI am not a saint;â âTake what you find, and trust it.â And I did, While with his peaceful eyes upon my face He cheated me,âmasking the life I loathe By a calm flow of falsehood! CRANSTON. Do not weep! Rest in yourself,âforget these common hearts. LADY GRACE. But these are all I live for. CRANSTON. Say it not. A crown is in your reach. LADY GRACE. You speak in clouds. CRANSTON. Your life lies out before you like a field Wherein you have but paced a little way; What matter if you stumbled? Stand upright, Pass by the grave where you have wept enough, Pass it, and leave your tender thoughts upon it, Your faithful memories, your gracious flowers; But not your hopes, but not your living self! Go on to better joys. LADY GRACE. I see them not. CRANSTON. You are what all men dream of. You are young. Are you afraid to love? LADY GRACE. No, not to love, Only to speak. CRANSTON. Choose noblyâchoose at once! Your equal, lest men scorn you in your choice; Your master, lest you scorn yourself in him; Your slaveâbut that is sure. And, having chosen, Make love the centre of your days, and leave All else upon the verge. You have loved onceâ LADY GRACE, looking down. Once only. I was wed, a child, and gave Only my reverence. CRANSTON. Give now your heart. Think on my words. LADY GRACE. You are going? CRANSTON. I am gone. I have presumed too far to counsel you, Yet take it for the service of a friend, Who from his unmoved distance watches you And sees your life in large. LADY GRACE, controlling herself. I take it so. CRANSTON, aside. If I bear this, I can bear all.(Aloud.) Farewell! LADY GRACE. StayâI would thank you. This was prudent counsel And, if I followâ CRANSTON. Not in haste! LADY GRACE. Enough. The theme is tender, and I am not used To bare my inmost petals to the sky. I suffer in such talk; let it now cease. (Exit Cranston, bowing gravely.) SCENE VI. LADY GRACE, alone. Where shall I hide myself! I have shown my heart, If not to him, I have shown it to myself, And am for ever shamed. His âunmoved distance!â Was that a warning? O, for my base fault There's no forgiveness! Were I a child, a girl, With blind and wondering fingers forcing out Th' unconscious music never heard before, There were some grace about my rashness. I! Who kept my womanhood in state, and held The threshold of my throne too high a place For a man's hand!âI, to have cast myself Under the heel of pity! Hide this vileness From him, the world, myself! Hide it! I'll prove It was an insolent blunderâhis, not mine,â Not I to work this bold impossible shame Which honest tongues glide over. Let me die With my name noble! (Enter Lord Lynton.) LORD LYNTON. Lady Grace! LADY GRACE. My lord, I am not well. LORD LYNTON. You are too generous To play with me; thrice have you thrust me back With studied pretexts such as women use To spare our pride the homely, hateful âNo.â But I am obstinate; I learn no task Save by compulsion; you must tell me broadly You will not have me, or I stay by you Till to the closeness of a siege you yield, Subdued not conquered,âan you will, starved out! If you disdain my speakingâ LADY GRACE. Heaven forbid! It is your part to speak. LORD LYNTON. Oh, say you so? Then I will tell you twenty times I love you; And, if you weary of the tale, I'll say You are so fair, so wise, so just, so modest, I cannot choose but love you, as mere sight Makes men desire a rose, a jewel, a crown, Because Heaven made them so desirable. If you reject meâ (While he speaks, re-enters Cranston; he stops short.âLady Grace perceives him.) LADY GRACE. I have done with love. LORD LYNTON. But I'm content with less. I seek yourself, Not as I would, but as you are. Endure me, And I'll beset you so with tenderness That from your root of patience shall spring up The perfect flower of love. LADY GRACE. Then am I yours. (Gives him her hand; as he is about to embrace her, she checks him.) We are not alone. I pray you, let us go.(She takes his arm, and they go out, passing Cranston.) To Cranston. Thanks for your counsel. I have followed it. LORD LYNTON. What counsel, Sweet? LADY GRACE. My lawyer,ânothing more. (Exeunt Lady Grace and Lord Lynton.) Scene VII. CRANSTON, alone. Ah, comfortable scorn; were her heart cold, Thou wouldst not be so bitter! In thy sting Is healing. I am cruel to find it so, For I myself have wrought this bitter fate; I have uncrowned my life, and henceforth set it Beyond the reach of hope,ânot she, but I; Not her kind hand that trembled in my hold, Not her soft eyes which seek me now through tears, Not her imperial heart, which might have been, Which was mine own. I will say it to myself,â 'Tis all I have, or shall have. To know this, That being loved, and loving, with such force As fills the whole capacity of man, I, for her sake who is so dear, undo The clue that should have drawn me up to bliss, And give the meagre story of my days No close but those indifferent words âhe died;â He died, who never lived. O, she is lost! Were it to do, it were undone for ever! The madness of my virtue has destroyed me. Fool, fool!âMy happy weakness comes too late; It can but dusk the honour of my grief Through my long line of undelightful noons, And all grey drearness of my evening times. END OF SECOND ACT. ACT III. SCENE I. âEvening. Lady Grace's Garden. Enter Rosa with a letter. ROSA. Alone at last! And now what writes Sir George? (Reads.) âAm I never to have the opportunity of speaking to you alone again? Do walk with me under the chestnuts this evening.âS.â Under the chestnuts? Why, I'm there! I'll fly Ere he arrives to think me so compliant, Coming when I am called! (Going, she encounters Sir George, who enters hastily.) SIR GEORGE. I'm in despair That you should wait for me. ROSA. Console yourself, I never wait. I came for privacy, And, meeting you, I'll wander somewhere else. SIR GEORGE. Unkind! You had my note? ROSA. Not I! SIR GEORGE. I'll swear I see it in your hand. ROSA, crumpling it up, and closing her hand. I'll swear you do not! I want to swear,âteach me some delicate oath, Such as you use on Sundays. Let me go! (He is trying to open her hand.) You shall not see the paper, no, you shall not, Though you are such a hero to a woman! SIR GEORGE. But tell me what it is. ROSA. A little bill. Friend, you may see it is a shop-boy's writing. (Holds it up before his eyes a moment, and then thrusts it behind her.) SIR GEORGE. Well, if you duly pay such little bills, 'Tis all I ask. ROSA. Ask anything you pleaseâ There's no defence from askingâalms or news. SIR GEORGE. I would you had a boon to ask of me. ROSA. I cannot brook to ask and be refused. SIR GEORGE. What man refuses when a woman pleads? ROSA. What can man give that's worth a woman's pleading? SIR GEORGE. His life. ROSA. Not half the value of a novel! SIR GEORGE. His heart. ROSA. A bargainâbut it will not wear. SIR GEORGE. Himself. ROSA. O, mercy! anything but that! What could she do with it? SIR GEORGE. Why, you should know, Who count your slaves by dozens. ROSA. I declare I cannot make you angry. SIR GEORGE. Did you try? Nay, that's a boon I could not grant a woman Though she knelt for it. ROSA. Yet, I'd wring it from you If I tried long enough. I'd ask your friend To tell your foibles, and I'd taunt you with them Before a princess. SIR GEORGE. laughing. Come, a truce, a truce! You beat me from the field. ROSA. I do remember I asked a favour of you once. SIR GEORGE. What was it? ROSA. I asked you for a little amber clasp, A trifle, brought from Rome, not worth refusing, And yet you gave it not. I wanted it Because I have lost one in a set, and yours Matched it exactly. SIR GEORGE. Nay, but I am sure You did not ask it. ROSA. Well, 'twas in a waltz; I think I went a little fast for you, And you were so attentive to your steps, Perhaps you did not hear me. SIR GEORGE. You are dreaming! Too fast for me! There was a wager once How many of the lightest limbs in Paris My waltzing pace would tire. I took a dozen, And danced them all to faintness. ROSA. What a shame! That was when you were young? SIR GEORGE, startled, but recovers himself. You cannot vex me. ROSA, clapping her hands. You were angry for a moment! Come, you'll give me That little clasp. SIR GEORGE. There is a tale about it. ROSA. Tell meâI love to listen to romance., SIR GEORGE. I had it from a sweet Hungarian girl, Whoâbut I'm silent there; you must not ask me. Enough to know that she was beautiful And kind, and when she took it from her hair (A sweep of gold, like yours,) and gave it me, She took a promise from me. ROSA. I was sure That you would say so. Not to part with it! I wish I had not asked you. SIR GEORGE. Softly! softly! You're so impetuous. What I promised her Was this, that if I parted with her gift To some more happy woman,âso she said, With a sweet, helpless accent of reproach, Like one who knew she could not rein the steed That paused by her a moment,âI should give it On two conditions. ROSA. Tell them. SIR GEORGE. They are these. The woman who would win that clasp from me Must come, alone, to fetch it from my rooms, And give me in exchange a tress of hair Which mine own hand must sever. ROSA. I'm content, If you cut evenly and make no gap To spoil me for the ball. SIR GEORGE. Upon these terms The clasp is yours. ROSA. To-night? SIR GEORGE. Ay, if you come Now to my rooms. ROSA. There is no better time; I'm safe for all the evening. She is gone To some dull meeting,âcharity or science, I know not which. SIR GEORGE. But you must wear a veil; Some passer in the street might see your face And spread the news to-morrow. I were loth To bring her wrath upon you. ROSA. Wait for me, I'll join you in a moment. Such a frolic I never risked before. I'm charmed with it! (Exit Rosa.) SIR GEORGE. There were more flattery in a little fear, But that might baffle me. I could not urge A girl with scruples. She is scruple-proof. Now, when I house her, fetch my witnesses, And fix my triumph, if she blush at all (I know not that she can), 'twill pass in laughter. In half an hour she'll boast of this exploit As boys of duels; we shall keep her secret As faithfully as though she were ashamed, So there's no harm. (Re-enter Rosa in a hat, veil, and shawl.) ROSA. See, I have cloaked myself In my aunt's wrappings. She is just my height And I may pass for her. SIR GEORGE. A brilliant thought! We must be quick. ROSA. I have wished a hundred times To know how you men live in those strange caverns You call your homes. Now I shall see it all! I'm on the threshold of a fairy tale! SIR GEORGE. I'll show you wonders. (Exeunt Sir George and Rosa.) SCENE II. Enter Lady Grace, musing. Time quenches all,âI am athirst for time; Could I but press a year into an hour, And scan mine anguish with the tranquil eyes Of one who says âit was.â Across the stream Is calm, but I am crying from the depths. Now must I count my bitter thoughts, and say,â After so many pangs, so many prayers, So many faint appeals to fairer hope, So many swift relapses unto pain,â There shall be conquest. Over what? A heart Slain but not healed, never to bleed again Because it cannot. If I had done a sin I were content to suffer; all I did Was to be ignorant of what I did. I knew not, saw not, felt not, that the rein Was sliding from my fingers (that is sin In women) till I lost it, on the brink, And fell through flowers that mask a precipice. I am down now. O, that I stood again Upon the pleasant levels!âthat I walked With passionless decision, like a nun, Watching my steps. I cling among the thorns; I'll fall no lower,âlet them pierce me here As I strive upwards. (Enter a maid with a packet.) MAID. Madam, from Lord Lynton. (Gives it.) LADY GRACE. From whom? From him? I had forgotten him. MAID. Will you be pleased to read? The servant waits. LADY GRACE. I must be pleased. A message from the master Whom for myself I chose. What have I done? Let me not wrong him,â'twere to strike the hand Stretched out to save me. (Opens the packet, takes out a bracelet, and reads.) âDo not scorn my first gift, but wear it, if only in remembrance of my joy. âLynton.â I should be glad to make another glad Who only lives to serve me, but I am not. This joy but comes to whet the after-grief That it should cut the deeper. I have done Two wrongs, in loving where I should not love, And making love my duty where I cannot. I am like one who, being sick to death, Takes poison to be rid of his disease, And dies the sooner. O, that it were night! And O! that it were morning after night, And I were past the waves and wrecks of youth, Softly at anchor in some tideless sea, Till the slow sunset reach me! Where's my niece? MAID. Madam, I know not. LADY GRACE. You look strangely at me. No pain is like the preface to a pain. Tell me at once,âshe is dead! MAID. Now Heaven forbid! She passed me with a festal countenance When she went out just now. LADY GRACE. I am afraid If but an eyelash quiver. She went out,â Was she alone? MAID. No, Madam. LADY GRACE. With her cousin? MAID. No, Madam. LADY GRACE. Prithee speak; thou stiflest me With these âNo, Madams.â MAID. Well, then, if she kills me I'll tell the truth. She wore a walking-dress, And went with Sir George Sandys. LADY GRACE. At this hour! A girl! alone! 'tis more than foolishness. Where went they? MAID. As I gathered from their talk, Across the park. LADY GRACE. But where? MAID. If I must say, They went together to Sir George's rooms. I heard her say that she had wished to see How men live in their single palaces, And he said he would show her. LADY GRACE. after standing speechless for a moment. Get my cloak. MAID. Madam, I hope if she is wroth with me, You will excuse me; I have never been A talebearer. LADY GRACE. Go, child; you have done no wrong. 'Tis my mistake; I should have gone with them, And I must follow. Fetch my mantle, quick. I would not make them wait. (Exit maid.) This is some jest, In her a frolic, but in him a crime. She throws her name to him without a fear; He, having caught it, stains it. Oh, 'tis vile, Out of the lightness of an hour to draw That unrelieved repentance of a life Which finds no help. I must be swift to hide And bold to speak. (Re-enter maid with a hat and cloak.) That's well. You must not say You saw your lady with Sir George alone. We must be careful, girl; there is no cure For this tongue-venom, if you have a place Where it can sting; you must be all in mail. Be sure you tell it not. (She puts on the hat and cloak.) MAID. I will not breathe it Against my pillow. LADY GRACE, gives her money. There is for your promise. You shall have double if 'tis kept a year. MAID. I'll keep it twenty years at a such a price. (Exeunt separate ways.) SCENE III. âSir George Sandys' Sitting-room. A vestibule seen beyond, lighted.âA servant waiting in the vestibule. âRosa sits in an easy-chair, looking at a photographic album. âSir George kneels beside her, turning the pages. ROSA, looking at a portrait. You said your sister? SIR GEORGE. When I show a woman Another woman's portrait in this book I always say my sister. ROSA. laughing. Do you find They wonder hugely at your family? Why here are twenty faces. (She turns the pages to and fro.) SIR GEORGE. All my sisters; All the fair creatures who have granted me A brother's gentle freedom. You are one. ROSA. You shall not have my portrait in your book. SIR GEORGE. I think there is a place that waits for it, Here, by my sweet Hungarian. You are sisters. Have not I found you so? ROSA. You shall not have it. SIR GEORGE. Be not disturbed. It is my private book; I only show you to each other. ROSA. Mine You shall not show. SIR GEORGE. Well, be content; I will not. I'll keep it for myself. ROSA. You shall not have it; Not on conditions, not upon your knees. I to be strung in such a rosary! (Tosses the book away and rises.) SIR GEORGE, aside. I must appease her, or I lose my game. (Aloud.) Undo that folded frown. I did but jest; I would not set your face among those faces If you besought me to it. ROSA. See you do not. I hardly trust you. SIR GEORGE. You shall find me then Above your trust and level with your wish. Say, shall I fetch the clasp? ROSA. Is it not here? SIR GEORGE. I have it in my chamber. Please yourself A moment with these poor appliances That grace a home severely womanless. Here hangs a picture, Guido's Esperanza. 'Tis so I dream my wife; so softly prompt, A hope that only waits to be fulfilled. This marble is from Florence. You perceive With what a fire the sculptor worked, who made A stone that moves and blushes while you gaze. And hereâ ROSA, pausing before a picture. Was this the horse you rode at Silcot, When Godfrey Vere was thrown? SIR GEORGE, embarrassed. No, not that horse. ROSA. O, pardon, I remember; you were thrown, And Godfrey Vere at Silcot won the day. You would not prize the portrait of that horse. SIR GEORGE. It is the only race I ever lost. ROSA. The first, you mean. I pray you fetch my clasp; The hour grows late. SIR GEORGE. I will return with it. (To the servant in the vestibule as he goes out.) Keep watch while I am gone. Be very gentle, But do not let the lady leave the room. SERVANT. I will not, Sir. (Exit Sir George.) ROSA. I do not like his ways; I feel new freedom in his eye and voice, Painting my rashness strongly. I'll be gone Ere he returns. (She goes hastily to the entrance of the vestibule.) SERVANT. Madam, you cannot pass. ROSA. Are you a gaoler? SERVANT. Madam, no, but ordered To bar your passage. ROSA. Is it so? I'll test it. I think you will not touch me. (She tries to pass; the servant prevents her.) SERVANT. Madam, pardon. Wait but a moment till Sir George returns. ROSA. You have insulted me. Your place is lost. It is not possible that you were told To lay a finger on me. SERVANT. I had orders. My place is lost if I obey them not. (Enter Lady Grace in the vestibule, behind the servant.) ROSA, perceiving her. O aunt, aunt, aunt, come to me! LADY GRACE, advancing. You are frightened. I am here to give you safety. (To the servant.) Let me pass. SERVANT. I had no orders to keep ladies out, Only to shut them in. (Lady Grace and Rosa come to the front.) LADY GRACE. Why are you here? You know not what you have done. ROSA. I have done no harm. LADY GRACE. You will be slighted in the common talk, Named with a glance, the tale put by, but growing Through all the silences, thus, âIn her youth, She did,âI will not tell you what she did.â Or, âThere was something; just a shade. 'Twere well She should not know your daughters.â You will live Shrinking and hardening in the doubtful eyes That scan youâangry with your bitter shame, Earned, not deserved. You did not think of this, But there's yet time. ROSA. You know we cannot pass. How can you bear to say such words to me? If I am so esteemed, it were as well To scorn myself and live in wickedness, Like women that one reads of. (Weeps.) LADY GRACE. Do not weep. ROSA, wringing her hands. What can I do but weep? It is too late. LADY GRACE. Too late is in the will, not in the fact. Here, change with me. Your keeper knows us not; Pass by him fearless, fly, be swift, be mute; Let not the air discern you as you pass, Till it close after you. (She puts her own hat and mantle on Rosa.) ROSA, hesitating. But you are left. What can you do? LADY GRACE. Oh! never think of me. ROSA. But if it is so monstrous to be here, Your name may suffer too. LADY GRACE. A kindly thought, For which I thank you, though I need it not. My name is strong. Oh! be content. I tell you There is no man on earth would slander me. ROSA, aside. I think some women might. LADY GRACE. What, anxious still? Surmise is deadly to a girl unproved, But I am tried and known; my presence here No danger, a rebuke. ROSA. I must obey you. (Exit Rosa, with her veil down.) LADY GRACE, alone. She might have marred her life! If I could pause, From any fear or scruple for myself, I think I were the basest woman breathing. Would I were hence! I never stood before Within the reach of an audacious thought. (Voices without.) Hark!âhe is coming. I have but to face A moment's wonderânothing more. I laugh To think that I should shake for such a cause. 'Tis newness scares us all. We are afraid To do the thing we have not done, which loses All terror in the doing,âlike a child Who fears a dragon in the unknown fields, But in the garden sets its careless foot Upon an adder's neck. I'll stand aside. He must not know me till I speak. SCENE IV. Lady Grace, Sir George Sandys. SIR GEORGE, speaking to persons behind him as he enters the vestibule. Wait! wait! Some decent prelude's needed.(To the servant.) You can go. (Exit Servant.) (Approaching Lady Grace, who stands with averted face.) I know you love a jest. My friends are here; I said I had a treasure in this room, And they're on fire to see. I'll let them in. They think you are a pictureâor a gemâ Or haply some new pipe from Germanyâ The quaintest notion. Rosaâ (She turns and looks at him.) Lady Grace! LADY GRACE. Now Heaven be praised, she's gone! SIR GEORGE. Gone! LADY GRACE. Sir, you thought To have your pastime with a flawless name, Not heeding though you broke it. She's a child Courting a touch in play,âstruck even to death On her bare innocent heart before she knows it. SIR GEORGE. Upon my honourâ LADY GRACE. Let your honour pass, I think it is a little out of place. SIR GEORGE. Nay, you are angry. LADY GRACE. O Sir, did you think What you were doing?âyou who know the worldâ Tempting a dancer to a precipice, And, while her gay foot passes, standing close To hear the laughter shaken into cries Too late for help. SIR GEORGE. You take me for a villainâ LADY GRACE. Is that a blunder? SIR GEORGE. Hear me when I swear This was a jest, a mirth, a merry mischief, She side by side with me in planning it; Not a harm purposed, not a risk incurred More than she welcomes twenty times a day. Oh, pardon me, the lady knows the world As well as I,âmuch better than yourself. LADY GRACE. She knows her dreams where not a rose she plucks Has thorns to pierce her. Will you tell your man To let me pass? he barred the way before, According to your honourable orders. SIR GEORGE, pointing to the vestibule door, and speaking with an air of confusion. The room is full of men. LADY GRACE. You can dismiss them. SIR GEORGE. But how? They know there is a lady here; Though you disdain me, I would do you pleasure If it were possible. This was a wager. They know too much to go, not knowing more. LADY GRACE. Know they the lady's name? SIR GEORGE. Not certainly. LADY GRACE. Swear to me that you will not breathe her name! Let me pass for her; none will aim at me,â I am wide of all the targets. Ah, be kind! I will believe you never purposed harm,â Nay, I'll think nobly of you. SIR GEORGE. I were loath To lose my chance of such a thought, and ifâ LADY GRACE, with her hands on his arm. Oh, no, no, no! Set not a traitor âIfâ Between your soul and any gracious act! You shall not stir till you have promised me! SIR GEORGE, turning to her, and taking her hand. Nay,âthere's my promise! (Enter Fitzerse, Raymond, Capel, and Lord Lynton.) SCENE V. ALL, speaking as they enter. Treason, Sandys, treason! Where is this lady? Is the wager lost, Or do you mock us? SIR GEORGE, to them. Were you not entreated To wait my summons? Do not be amazed, She came upon a charitable errand. (To Lady Grace.) And so, dear lady, having heard your tale And helped your client, you will suffer me To be your honoured escort. LADY GRACE. You are thanked With all the words I have. CAPEL. It is Lady Grace! RAYMOND. I am struck dumb. FITZERSE. If I had met a ghost I should be less disturbed. LORD LYNTON, gravely advancing with Lady Grace's hat and cloak. Pray you, permit me; Your charitable errand being fulfilled, You may resume your cloak. (He puts it on for her; she stands in manifest embarrassment.) The hour is late; My carriage can convey you home, unless Some exigence of charitable duty Demand a journey with this gentleman. LADY GRACE. I claim your gentle judgment, having never Deserved a doubt. LORD LYNTON, conducting her to the door. I do not judge a woman; I trust herâwhen I can. (Raymond, Capel, and Fitzerse all draw back to let Lady Grace pass.âRaymond opens the door for her.) LADY GRACE. Thank you. Good-night. I shall meet you at the ball on Thursday? RAYMOND. Yes; I book you for a valse. LADY GRACE. I do not dance. RAYMOND. You did notâall things changeâI live in hope. LADY GRACE, aside. Means he to twit me with my past? I like not That phrase of âchangeâ and âhope.â (She turns as she is leaving the room, and speaks with great dignity.) My presence here Is a dark sentence; pray decipher it By the unflinching lustre of my life, And you shall find the words areâinnocent. (They stand silent.âExit Lady Grace.) RAYMOND, returning to the others. A little strange, my friends, a little awkward, But carried like a queen. CAPEL. Who would have dreamed Of this! Now, Sandys, read the riddle for us. FITZERSE. One point is clear, the wager is not won. Confess that you have failed. SIR GEORGE. If it be failure To win one woman while you seek another. ALL, except Lord Lynton. Come, come, explain. SIR GEORGE. I will not speak one word. I leave you to your guesses. Let us talk Of this at supper. (He ushers them to the door.âExeunt Raymond, Capel, and Fitzerse.âLord Lynton stops and turns to Sir George.) LORD LYNTON. Twenty years ago There had been blood for this. But we, to-day, Leave every question to defend itself; And if a woman needs defence, I think She scarce deserves it. Will you tell me plainly What this thing means? SIR GEORGE. Have you a right to ask? LORD LYNTON. I had. SIR GEORGE. You give it up? Well, you are wise, If your right hangs on any word of mine; For I say nought but this: I hold the lady virtuous. LORD LYNTON. You are bound To say so much. SIR GEORGE. I am bound to say no more. If this content you, well. LORD LYNTON. And if it do not? SIR GEORGE, shrugging his shoulders. Why then, well, too! I am either way content. (Exeunt.) END OF ACT III. ACT IV. SCENE I. âA Boudoir. Lady Grace alone. 'Twas but a momentâyet it burns! I thought I could have tossed the doubt as lightly from me As Autumn casts away her worthless leaves; But never shrank the guilty with more fear Than I, most innocent. I could slay myself! If I were tried for life my face would wrong me To sure conviction. I'll not think of it. I am assured no cloud can touch my name; This fear is fever,âremedies, not reasons, The weapons for its conquest. I'll forget it. I'll read,âfor, O, the calmness of a book! Come, you slow magic, breathe upon me, soothe me, Fix, win, entrance,âyou know the way of old; These pictured storms have power upon the wind, If it blows on, we heed not. Weep, Elaine,â Counting your tears I shall not feel my own. (She reads.) After a pause. The poet errs to make her tell her love; A woman dies first,âshe died afterwards. O, how she must have wished her secret back In her dead heart and honourable grave! Enter Rosa disconsolately. ROSA. Aunt, I'm unhappy. LADY GRACE, looking up with reluctance. Have you lost your bird? ROSA. You laugh, but I am weary of my life; I want to dive into some country depth And never see a man. LADY GRACE. What have men done? ROSA. Nothing and everything,âit is myself. LADY GRACE. Why then you should depart from solitude. Some green seclusion with yourself at peace Is rapture; for a soul at war within, 'Tis but slow torment. ROSA. I have heard you talk About a house in Devon, lawned and bowered, Set like a flower beside a river-flow, Stilled by soft woods, and dignified with hills Which take a mountain blueness where they range. You said the water whitened to the moon, With sprays of purple leafage spread against it, As on a page of glory; and I want To go there, and to take into my heart The beauty and the darkness and the peace; For since you said it I have thought of it, And in the night I think of it, and see The shining water and the sombre leaves, Till something rises in me like a sob, And I stretch forth my hands and am distressed, And long to get some rapid cloaks about me And go there in a moment. Let me go. LADY GRACE, taking her hand and looking eainestly at her. So, such a change! What hand has touched your eyes To see the spirit and the power of earth? You love. ROSA, hesitating. I think one loves me. LADY GRACE. One? Nay, twenty. You are sure of twenty. Tell me of that one Of whom you think. What, dumb? How quick we learn This modesty of passion! Here are lips Which chattered yesterday like leaves in wind And have not now the courage for a name. I'll speak it for you. ROSA. But you know it not. LADY GRACE. Fitzerse. ROSA. Who told you? LADY GRACE. If I say himself I am not too bold. ROSA. O! tell me what he said. Spoke he at length and gravely? Did he seek Your favour for his suit? Was it a suit Or the vague pleasantness of praise? What praised he? My eyes, lips, hair? I know he thinks me lovely, For a sure witness says she heard him say so. But slow ambition of some finer sort Was born in me to-day, I know not how, And I would rather have him praise my mind. Why speak you not? LADY GRACE. I am out of breath with listening; But where you leave a cleft I'll thrust a word. Only his eyes have told me of his love. You sigh and let your answering brightness drop And spread a slighted calm about your looks. I am learned in this face-logic; fallacies Beguile not me. Let me but watch two glances, And from those quick and tender premises I will conclude the truth. Hear it. He loves you With a fresh heart, which your most delicate hand May touch and take unstained. ROSA. But what am I For him? He sees me nobler than I am. Let me go hence and think about my life Till it begins to mend. LADY GRACE. I bar you not. I would all penitents had sins as small, Films from a flawless crystal brushed away. ROSA, taking her hands. Sweet Aunt, I should not tell you, but I must. He spoke to me about that grievous night; You know my meaning; he was sorrowful, And wished me parted from you, and was pained At what you seemed to do. You love him not, And so this cannot wound you; yet forgive me For telling you. If he should guess the truth I lose him on the instant. LADY GRACE. And for this You wish to leave me. ROSA. Nay, I wish it not. Be not so hard with me. LADY GRACE. Am I so hard? ROSA. You are the gentlest, dearest aunt that lives. You'll let me go? LADY GRACE. But will you tell him truth? Lie not to him. I think there is no sin, But somewhere on the road to 't stands a lie, And they who will not cross it shall be safe. Tell him no lies. ROSA. You have such dreadful names For harmless things. Will you accuse me to him? You have the right if you would clear yourself. But tell me first, for if I know he knows it I'll never look upon his face again. Have you the heart? LADY GRACE. O child! you call me hard; But I am weaker than the wandering drifts Flung from the brows of onward-pressing waves. Do as you list. ROSA, kisses her. Why, that's my gentle aunt! Now must I say farewell. Love me a little And miss me if you can. I'll think of you As babes of fairies, owing all my bliss To your mere silence. I'll remember you, And never do a foolish thing again. I'll write to you. Farewell. (Exit Rosa.) LADY GRACE. Ay, and you'll love me If you may leave me. Why, this hope of absence Spurs your regards to such a sudden growth They tower above my reach. (Re-enter Rosa.) ROSA. Aunt, ere I go, Say you forgive me. 'Twas my need that wronged you, Never my heart. LADY GRACE. In love there are no wrongs, And out of it no rights; so, if you love me, Sue not for pardonâwe are heart to heart, And should you wound me, 'tis an accident, Which to resent were most ungenerous; But if you love me not you cannot wound me, For I am covered with that greater wrong And do not feel the blow. ROSA. O! you would reason The heart out of a butterfly. Farewell. (Exit Rosa.) LADY GRACE. Not worthy to be with her! 'Tis a jest, Some blind bewilderment of love. The world Sees facts in their own shapes, and untransformed By lustrous hazes of the heart. The world I need not fear; and yet it irks my soul That any man should think of me as men Should never think of women. There is now One face i' the world I am ashamed to see. I have not sinned; I think I have not blundered. The little innocent trouble that I bear Stays a whole life from ruin. Shall I set This blush against a fate? SCENE II. âA Room in Mrs. Vane's House. Five o'clock tea.âMrs. Vane, Emma Vane, Lady Melville, Captain de Courcy.âEmma Vane is making tea, with Captain de Courcy in attendance. EMMA. This for mamma. (Gives him a teacup.) DE COURCY. There now, it is too full. That was your fault. (Spills it.) EMMA. How can you be so awkward? You should have held it with a steady hand. I will not have you for my aide-de-camp. DE COURCY. You are so hard. You'll have me for a partner If not an aide-de-camp? EMMA. Give me my tablets. (He gives the tablets.) This is not right; you are set down five times. DE COURCY. Please let me look. I have not finished yet. EMMA. Mamma would never hear of it. DE COURCY. She need not. EMMA. For shame! Besides, I could not keep it from her. MRS. VANE. Emma! EMMA. Now we must join them. (They cross to the sofa, on which Mrs. Vane and Lady Melville are sitting.) MRS. VANE. You were speaking About our ball to-night? EMMA, kneels before her mother and gives the tablets. Just look, Mamma, What he has done. DE COURCY. O! such an awful crime. MRS. VANE. We'll judge it at our leisure. But, meantime, Captain de Courcy, you are one of us, No skimmer of the surface, but a friend Deep in the heart of home, and I may trust you (May I not?), count on you, and look to you As to a son? DE COURCY, aside. She frightens me to death. (Aloud.) Dear Mrs. Vane, well, in a certain sense, You are so kind, and, in a certain sense, I am so grateful; but I think you know me. MRS. VANE. I know that you are better than your words. Just now I want a trifling service done,â The merest trifle. DE COURCY, aside. I was sure of it. (Aloud.) Too happy! Anything in reason. Not To valse with one of those determined matrons Who think we cannot see how old they are, Because they never tell us? MRS. VANE. O! the wretch (To Lady Melville.) Hear him, Amelia. LADY MELVILLE. I'll remember it When next he is on duty at a ball, Taking his troubles with an easy face As if he liked them. MRS. VANE, to Captain de Courcy. What I ask you now, Though a mere trifle, is so delicate It needs an airy touch,âthe touch of a man Who knows the world. Your auntâ DE COURCY. O ay! my aunt! I heard there was some talk about my aunt. What is it? Tell me freely. I'm not bound To stand up for my aunt. MRS. VANE. I was convinced You would be candid. There's a little scandal. DE COURCY. 'Twill grow. MRS. VANE. I fear it; and, you see, this child, (Pointing to Emma.) No breath must touch her. Were it but myself, As I am sure 'tis but a passing cloud, I'd lead her through it bravely. But I must not, Being a mother. Therefore speak to her, And tell her gently, till this story dies, Just for a little while, 'tis her best wisdom To stay at home lest she should meet cold looks. DE COURCY. Humph! could you write a note? MRS. VANE. Nay, ask yourself If that be possible. Besides, the tongue Is worth a sheaf of pens. LADY MELVILLE. She must not come To the ball to-night. Tell her to sprain her ankle, Catch cold or fever, lose a relative, And stay at home to weep. DE COURCY. What shall I do? I am afraid to speak the truth to her. Devise me something that may pass for truth, And so prevail. LADY MELVILLE. I say she must not come. Some will be here who would not hesitate To cut her. And the sadness of the thing! The pain for Emma! Fall you sick yourself, And make her nurse you. MRS. VANE. You are vehement. LADY MELVILLE. I think of you and Emma. DE COURCY. Not of me. None of you think of me. MRS. VANE. Nay, nay, dear friend, It is because we think of you so much, Trust you so fully, claim you so entirely, That in this strait we come to you for help. Now, if you fail, I'll never trust a man. DE COURCY. How will you guerdon me if I succeed? With my five dances? MRS. VANE. You must plead for them To your fair partner. She commands herself. My Emma, you look pale. Go to your room,â Keep all your strength for this tremendous man, Who means to tax it. (Exit Emma.) LADY MELVILLE. We have spoken in kindness To Lady Grace; to a proud woman slighted The world looks black for ever. DE COURCY. She deserves it. This is your pattern woman, so afloat In ether, that the veriest slime of earth Grounds her before she knows. I'll not excuse her! To do such stupid, strenuous-minded things, And bring us all to trouble! MRS. VANE. 'Tis most true. DE COURCY. Well, talking will not mend it. Fare you well, And what I can, I will,âand where I cannot, You must forgive. MRS. VANE. You must not need forgiveness. Farewell till evening. 'Tis so comforting To feel that one can reckon on a man. (Shaking hands with him.) DE COURCY. Well, you may trust me,âin a certain sense. (Exit.) LADY MELVILLE. There goes the sweetest simpleton alive. MRS. VANE. Nay, nay, he knows the world: he has wit enough For social needs and self-establishment,â And then he has such a heart! LADY MELVILLE. You mean, he had. I think your daughter keeps it now. MRS. VANE. Well, well. She has a store of such small articles; Girls cannot do without them,âonly trinkets, Nothing for use. I'll let you know a secret: Were my Lord Lynton quit of Lady Grace, He would be Emma's suitor. LADY MELVILLE. Are you sure? MRS. VANE. As of my life! I never urge the child; I let her play with these safe, simple men, Who pass the time but never touch the thoughts, And, when the time is passed and the play over, I think she'll use her reason. A good girl; Easily guided. LADY MELVILLE. So unworldly, too! MRS. VANE. The charm of youth, my friend, the charm of youth; We lose it as we fade. But I look back To mine own springtime while I manage hers, Brushing the dew with a reluctant hand That leaves the flower unruffled. LADY MELVILLE. Sweetly said. (Exeunt.) Scene III. âA Vestibule at Mrs. Vane's, lighted and decorated. Music heard within.âServants passing and repassing, and names announced as carriages drive up to the door outside.âTwo or three groups of guests thus announced pass across the stage.âEnter from the ball-room Captain de Courcy. DE COURCY. Is Lady Grace Aumerle arrived? SERVANT. No, Sir. I set a man to watch, as you desired. DE COURCY. Be sure you let me know when she is here. SERVANT. I will, Sir. DE COURCY. Twice I called, and twice I failed To find her. Here I wait my only chance To bar her from the dancing-room. 'Tis vexing! I have not dared to speak to Mrs. Vane. If I fail now, I'll fly; for, having failed, I cannot face her. (Carriage outside.âServant announces Lord Lynton.) Now, the devil himself Brings him here at this moment. LORD LYNTON, entering. WhatâDe Courcy! (They shake hands.) Why stay you here when that delicious challenge Assails your ears? DE COURCY, sullenly. I'm waiting for my aunt. LORD LYNTON. So she's expected? DE COURCY. I'm afraid she is. LORD LYNTON. Afraid? DE COURCY. You should be able to persuade her Better than I; wait for herâspeak to herâ Make her go home! The people there have heard Untoward things, and till the story dies 'Tis better that she venture not among them. You understand me? LORD LYNTON. Do they mean to slight her? DE COURCY. Well, in a certain sense, I fear they do. Being her nephew, this is bad for me, But worse, perchance, for you. LORD LYNTON. For me to-night It may be worse; to-morrow it is nothing. DE COURCY. You are her plighted husbandâ LORD LYNTON. Gently, friend, Say that to no man. If a woman scathes Her name, she has no rights. In what I can I will befriend her,âbut my promises Were pledged to one above the reach of slights. (Enter Sir George Sandys.) DE COURCY. That's a wise judgment, in a certain sense, But I suppose it is not chivalrous. SIR GEORGE. Now, you romantic creatures, Londoners, And not ashamed to talk of chivalry! Say, will you charge the streets fulldress and make A Waterloo among our brigands? Pluck Is all you want. Our laws defeat themselves,â They spare the criminal and cramp the hero; Martyrs we need, to smite the sins they know, And bear the consequence. DE COURCY. Man, how you talk! (Carriage outside; servant announces Lady Grace Aumerle.â They all appear confused.) SIR GEORGE. I cannot bear to make a lady blush; I'll go. (Exit.) LORD LYNTON. I cannot meet her nowâand here. (He is going; Captain de Courcy stops him.) DE COURCY. Consider me! 'Tis hard. I'm all adrift. What shall I say? LORD LYNTON. Say what you list,âI'm gone. (Exit.âEnter Lady Grace; she gives her opera-cloak to a maid; coffee is offered her, but she declines it.) LADY GRACE, perceiving Captain de Courcy, who stands looking helplessly at her. Ah, nephew, you are graciously in time To squire me to the ball-room. DE COURCY. Pardon me; I tried to see you twice to-day. LADY GRACE. I know it. Your face is full of omens,âwhat hath chanced? DE COURCY. Nothing to make you pale. A passing blunder, Just a mischance,âa week will make it smooth; But I, who know the world, beseech you wisely Toâfaith, I cannot phrase it! LADY GRACE. Tax not now Your eloquence so far, wait till to-morrow; The hour is late, and there are listening ears. DE COURCY. Late now, too late to-morrow. Prithee hear me; Will you go home? LADY GRACE. Ay, when the dance is done. DE COURCY. Nay, nowâthis hourâ'twere better you should go; I am sent to tell you. LADY GRACE, drawing back. I am much afraid You know not what you sayâsoâlet me pass. DE COURCY, eagerly. I mean it kindly,âyou shall find cold welcome. LADY GRACE. Oh, hush, you shame us both. DE COURCY. You would not go Where they desire you not. LADY GRACE, to a servant. Pray keep him back; Send for some friend,âlet him not follow me; He should be in his chamber. (Exit hastily.) DE COURCY. Why, she's gone! A woman hath more will than a man wit; 'Tis her own choice, and she must answer it. (Exit.) SCENE IV. Stage opens and discovers a ball-room brilliantly lighted and decorated; the front represents the part of the room near the door, where Mrs. Vane is standing with a group of guests.âMusic and a valse, the dancers passing across; other persons from time to time join the group in front.âMrs. Vane, Lady Melville, Capel, with a lady; others.âMusic ceases, and the dancers promenade in couples. LADY MELVILLE. Emma looks lovely! (Emma passes with Lord Lynton.) MRS. VANE. 'Tis a pretty whim, That wreath of butterflies. It suits her style. LADY MELVILLE. So thinks her partner. MRS. VANE. Something in her face (I know she is not a beauty) wins and holds The most accustomed critics. Look at her; His words are wine, they make her blushes speak. LADY MELVILLE. Ah, you must press her hard to-night. Be sure She will have news to tell. (Servant announces `Lady Grace Aumerle.'âThey start, and change countenance.) MRS. VANE, aside. What's to be done? That simpleton has played us false! LADY MELVILLE. Or failed. MRS. VANE. She would never be so mad. Keep Emma from us. (Enter Lady Grace; she advances to Mrs. Vane, who receives her in the most chilling manner,âcurtseying, but not extending her hand.) LADY GRACE. I must have pardon for my niece. She went Only this morning. LADIES, to each other. Oh! the niece is gone. (Mrs. Vane makes a second silent curtsey.) LADY GRACE, approaching Lady Melville, who has a superb bouquet in her hand. I have not seen such lilies. LADY MELVILLE. apparently not observing her, but addressing Mrs. Vane. If I find him, I'll send him to you. (Goes to the back of the stage; Lady Grace stands bewildered.) MRS. VANE, to Capel. Will you lend your arm? I have a word to whisper to my daughterâ I see her there. (To Lady Grace.) Excuse us. (She takes Capel's arm, and they go out. As they pass, Lady Grace sees Capel, and starts; he bows with an air of confusion. âExeunt all save Lady Grace.) LADY GRACE. Was there scorn On all their faces? I have often heard Of a touch withering a woman's name,â Heard it as kings may hear of beggary, Shaking a little pity from my heights, Not reaching down my hand. O! my poor hand, Will no one clasp it? I that was ashamed Of a pure thought unsued for,âam I fallen? Must I henceforth be hidden, or descend To doubtful ways, where charitable souls Who will not think the worst may speak of me As of marred sunshine, saying it was fair Till the clouds blotted it! I'll get me home; I find I have no courage for this war. (Valse, music.âCurtain falls.) END OF ACT IV. ACT V. SCENE I. âA Room in Cranston's House. Enter Cranston with a letter. CRANSTON, reads. âI request that you will immediately take the necessary measures for making over the bulk of my property to my niece and nephew in equal divisions with a charge of an annuity to myself of four hundred pounds, being all that I now need. Grace Aumerle.â All that she needs? All now? Why now to need Only so little? She must learn the truth, Which yet she guesses not. This lord she marries, I never thought him lavish. He might say The gem he holds, being precious in itself, Needs but the richer setting. There he is right. He were right too, saying the opposite, Letting the diamond sparkle in his hand, Bare as a dew-drop. O! he loves her not. It cannot be that any woman on earth Having so drained the life-blood of one heart Should take another. 'Tis not possible. Why, the white freighted clouds, when overcharged With pure unceasing tributes from the ground, Break into tears and perish. I am thrust (And by a word) from the clear top of effort Down to the misty foot. Even here she wrote Her name, and here my hurrying heart throws down Its bitter habit of control, and drops Into mere grief and worship. (Enter a servant.) SERVANT. Sir, do you see Strangers to-day? CRANSTON. Who asks? SERVANT. A gentleman. (I lost the name.) I think I have seen him once With Lady Grace Aumerle. CRANSTON. Let him come in. (Exit servant.) Again this nephew! Would she dropped her bounty In worthier hands! (Enter Fitzerse.) (Aside.) O! this; I crave his pardon; This is a decent person. FITZERSE, very much embarrassed. I am come,â Excuse me, Mr. Cranston.âI am comeâ (Pauses.) CRANSTON. What can I do for you? FITZERSE. I am all unused To these law matters. CRANSTON. Tell me but your fact, And I'll supply your law. FITZERSE. I shall do so. Briefly, I want a deed of settlement. CRANSTON. So. FITZERSE, giving a paper. In these terms. Be pleased to look a moment Upon this paper; 'tis set clearly down. CRANSTON, reads low to himself. So, so, 'twere difficult to blunder here. Simply, you give the lady all you have. FITZERSE. I pray you set a clasp on every phrase; For law, they say, hath this disease, to grow In cunning hands elastic, and let through What it was knit to hold. CRANSTON, writing. They so malign us, Calling our scruples cavils. But I think The sharpest lawyer strains not language more For work, than other men for pleasure; yet Their honour shall be held too high for doubts, While ours is down to proverbs. FITZERSE. That may be; I cannot tell; I think I am true myself. CRANSTON, writing. So thinking you have touched the crown of thought. What is the lady's name? FITZERSE. Familiar to you When it was Wilmot. CRANSTON. Was! Your wife already? FITZERSE. Even so, since yesterday. CRANSTON. I think the lady Is under age; her aunt should be her guardian: I must conclude her privy to this deed? FITZERSE. O Sir, be satisfied. The Lady Grace, Having dropped (I grieve to say it) her fair name Into some tangle of unworthy talk, Has come to think severely of the world; And soâ'tis said the case is commonâleaves it. CRANSTON. Having done what? FITZERSE. You did not hear the tale? CRANSTON. I pray you tell it. FITZERSE. She is known for one Who slights the general voice, and strives to look Into the heart of all things, not concerned With aspects and observances. She wentâ He said 'twas on some charitable quest, And doubtless 'twas soâbut alone, at even, Found by a troop champagned and clareted (I'm sorry I was one), and nothing said To bar a strange conclusion; 'tis no marvel If they concluded strangely. CRANSTON. What? FITZERSE. Nay, pardon! The meaning tells itself. CRANSTON. You have told me nothing. Where went she? FITZERSE. To the lodgings of George Sandys. CRANSTON. She? by herself? FITZERSE. Even so. But you are moved. CRANSTON. I am the lady's lawyer, nothing more; Bound merely in the course of business To plead her cause; and, by the light of heaven, I'll prove the man who doubts her by a look Aâblunderer! (Controlling himself.) FITZERSE. 'Twere well to prove it soon, If proof be possible. The harm is done; Hot words have bred cold looks, and I myself, With most unwilling and compassionate hands, Must shut the door, lest any thought assail The lady whom I honour as my wife. CRANSTON. You? FITZERSE. I, you see, have no alternative, For I beheld the scandal. I was sure, By the slow curve of Lynton's angry lip, When he so coldly drew her from the room, While we stood blank, that he would break with her. He could do nothing less. CRANSTON. Then he deserts her? FITZERSE. What could he do? CRANSTON. Unanswerable question! Limit your risks by their foreseen results, And so be safe. But never walk by faith Into the danger of the vast unknown. A man who did so once found a new world, And was, not safe, but famous for all time. 'Twas hardly worth the pains. FITZERSE. I think it was not, If I conceive you rightly. CRANSTON. What would you risk For one you loved? FITZERSE. My life. CRANSTON. How, nothing more? FITZERSE. I do not know a greater thing than life. CRANSTON. Life is a means to compass noble ends; Call it capacity for noble death You have told all its value, which being lost, You may spurn the empty winecup from your foot And never stoop to lift it. FITZERSE. What you say I understand not. CRANSTON. I am sure of that. Well, Sir, I have your notes; I'll draw your deed Before to-morrow. FITZERSE. I'm beholden to you. (Exit.) CRANSTON. Am I the dust of the ground to bear this fire, And neither blaze nor melt? How placidly He painted that blind vengeance of the world Against its purest! Things too mean for her foot Passing their shameful sentences upon her! She, wistful, white, astonished, facing them, Taking the stings into her delicate breast, Hiding them with proud hands, and dying of them, As virgin-martyrs die of contumely! How was it, O my love, that thou shouldst weep And I not know it? Was there any check In that continuous current of my thoughts Which sets to thee? I am reproached for it, And scorn myself, who grieve not that thy grief Hath bowed thee to the level of my hope. Rise now, strong heart, and sweep me to her feet, Pour there the secret which I thought to keep A silence, and a burden of despair Across the desert uncomplaining grave. (Exit.) SCENE II.âLady Grace's Library. Lady Grace. A woman in the dress of a Sister of Mercy. LADY GRACE. You have no vows? SISTER. We have no need of vows; We work but for the love of what we do And Him for whom we do it. LADY GRACE. And if a weak heart comes to work with you, Not only for the love of what you do, But for the fear and pain of what it leaves, You will not spurn such service? SISTER. Rather prize it. We wish to be such havens from the world That all the troubled hearts may flock to us. LADY GRACE. Well, then, to-morrow. SISTER. You have said âto-morrowâ Since first we spoke of this. I would not urge you, Yet, trust me, prefaces to books or deeds Are still the hardest reading. LADY GRACE. Give me time To grieve that I have nothing left to grieve for, To make my gentle parting, not with hopes, With disappointments that once looked like hopes, So sober in their dawn one might have thought Even time would pity them. I had put by The burning dream of bliss; I did but ask To walk in patient honour to my grave, Doing some good, helping some richer lives, Wearing a little love about my heart, Winning all trust, crowned with a stainless name. Meek wishes, but not one is granted me! Not one! not one! SISTER. You shall find all with us. These pure ambitions grow not in the world, Or only bud to perish; but our shade Fosters the tenderest germ. LADY GRACE. I'll try to think so. (Exit Sister.) O! how much better had I cast myself Under the footstool of the hope I scorned And wrung a moment's blessing! I am a fool To think it could have been! When I was born, âNot to be lovedâ was written on my brow. I know there are such dooms, to stray through life With outstretched hands that miss, but do not lose, Because they never found. Therefore I yield, Having no cause to fight for; like a child Who plucks a hollow fruit and flings it by,â Not satiate, not considerate, not resigned, But merely baffled. (Enter Cranston.) LADY GRACE, aside. O! this yet was wanting. Be proud, my heart, be proud. CRANSTON. Shall I have pardon For this intrusion? LADY GRACE. I commend your zeal, Although I asked it not. You have the deed? CRANSTON. Here, Madam. (Gives a paper. She takes it to a table and is about to sign without reading it.) Yet consider what you do. That little stroke that signs away your wealth You may repent too late. Gold can do much; 'Tis the condition of a thousand joys, An arm, a wing, a weapon; spurn it not, Till you consider. LADY GRACE. I have well considered. (Signs.) CRANSTON. You have done it. LADY GRACE, turning to him. There's a rapture in your voice Tunes not with warning words. Why are you glad? CRANSTON. O! I am glad too soon. The captive shouts When his chain breaks; but, finding a void home, Sighs for the senseless walls which hid despair, And so kept hope alive. LADY GRACE. Speak calmly to me; I am not strong to-day. CRANSTON. Be weak. I need The courage of your weakness. You must hear A tale. I'll tell it coldly, as a steward Gives up his reckoning. When your husband died He thus provided, if you wed again (You shrink, but you may do it), half your wealth Goes to your niece and nephew; all the rest To him you wed, who strips your power away After you have enriched him with your heart. Ungracious happiness! to force an alms From one who gives a life. This strange decree, Not told till now (you wonder with your eyes), Was trusted to the keeping of a man Whoâlisten to me, look at meâwho loved you With a slave's agony, seared into silence, Burnt on the lips and weighted on the soul. He had no right to lift his love to you, Save in the very strength whereby it soared Out of its deeps to your unfooted height, There waiting till a glance shall hurl it down. A desperate dumb love, which was to die Before it spoke, which may now slay itself With its first word (it is free, it is at your feet)â Speak, though you doom it! LADY GRACE. O! have pity on me, And let me go. CRANSTON. Speak first! LADY GRACE. I am not unworthy (I cannot let you think so). What I have done I would do again, and never need to kneel For pardon at the judgment-seat within. Think of me with such honour as you can; Think only you have gifted with your love The most unhappy woman in the world, Who, knowing that a stain is on her name, Has lost the right to take it. CRANSTON. Is that all? If any lip but yours profaned your name, I'd say it was a lie. LADY GRACE. But this is true. CRANSTON. If, by pure condescension of your virtue, You have done something rash against yourself, Or dangerously noble to another, What is it to the world? To me it is only One reason more for loving you. LADY GRACE. You know notâ CRANSTON. Peace! I know all. LADY GRACE. And love me still? CRANSTON. You ask it! LADY GRACE, giving him her hands. Do with me as you will, for I am yours; Forgive me all my faults; deceive me not. I think I never won a heart till now, And am afraid to touch it. I must weep, Because there is no virtue in myself Whereby to hold you. Are you sure you love me? O! say it not, unless you are so sure That what you love not, being found in me, Shall draw you closer. CRANSTON. Teach me by what oath I may convince you. LADY GRACE. I am credulous As a new convert, who expects his creed To save him by itself. O! if a cloud, The least faint, phantom mist of possible change, Lurk on the far horizon, leave me now, Before I make surrender of my life, For I am on the brink of such a deep That if I pass it there is no return. I am no child, to roam through coming time Plucking new blossoms; on my woman's heart I hold but one, the first, and if it fades, Hope dies for ever. CRANSTON. All the doubts you breathe Are musical with undertones of love, To certify my soul that I am blest; And yet I must be trusted,âthere's no bond Between us till you trust me. LADY GRACE. Look not grave, I have no doubts left. CRANSTON. Then must I teach you next (Being so apt) that glory in yourself Which you perceive not. I'll not teach it you! For if in any picture of my words You find faint reflex of your light, and learn To what a depth you stoop, you might resume Your solitude, and I should pass from you Like one born blind who, having seen a moment, Goes back into his vision-haunted darkness, Knowing what he has lost. LADY GRACE. You shall not speak Of stooping. CRANSTON. But I must. LADY GRACE. Is it because You work? Alas, it is not work that makes The misery and meanness of the world; 'Tis sloth, or self, or scorn, or cowardice, Growths on all levels. I have lived with such, And turn from them to you as if I went From a sick-room into a mountain wind Full of fresh heather. Let me be your clerk, And learn your mysteries. I can write fairly, For hours, unwearied. CRANSTON. You would find my work Not unconcerned with misery and meanness. LADY GRACE. Why, so much greater is your glory, love, To do it nobly. CRANSTON. If a man die honest, He does much, having lived. But we'll not talk Of anything but love. I'll prove to you How far you lag behind me. LADY GRACE. If you can, You work a miracle. I am afraid To say how soon I loved you. CRANSTON. Did you love me Twelve years ago? LADY GRACE. I did not know you then. CRANSTON. Forgetful heart! In those prophetic days, When first the tender colour breaks the sheath Before we know what shape the flower shall bear, I was beside you. Think upon the boy Who lured you from the schoolroom to the woods, Bore you through streams and throned you upon banks, Fenced unfamiliar fears away from you, Rifled all heights and waters of their jewels To make your lap their treasury,â LADY GRACE. I am confused With sweet remembrances. Were you that boy? CRANSTON. Ay, and I loved you then. LADY GRACE. You give me back Some of the secret honour that I lost When my heart sprang to meet you. (Enter Sir George Sandys with his arm in a sling.) CRANSTON. How! You dare To blot this presence! SIR GEORGE. Pardon me,âI come To make our blunders good. I was away, And heard but yesterday how all has chanced; (To Lady Grace.) I left the ball before I saw your face, Ashamed (I own it) of your needless shame; But I have smoothed it now. I have told the truth, And all are satisfied. LADY GRACE. You broke your word! I had your promiseâ SIR GEORGE. Nay, most eager lady, Will nothing chill you? Rosa's fame is safe, For she spoke first; her husband wrung it from her In some encounter of affection. Then 'Tis said we fought,âbut I forget these triflesâ Stay, I was hit,âthat proves it. To be brief, I pledged my word to spread the truth abroad, And told it wisely,âit has slipped aside Out of the grasp and gossip of the time As a girl's frolic pardoned. Good Fitzerse, In his first simpleness of love, forgives Whatever Rosa does,âhe was only wroth Till he was sure she did it; now, he says (O! you should hear him!), all have done as much, But only Rosa has the nobleness To own her young adventures. It is pretty To see them, but she might have spoken sooner, And spared us all this coil. LADY GRACE. Us! Pray you, keep Our names asunder. SIR GEORGE, shrugging his shoulders. I am blamed for all. Well, I'm a contrite sinner! (Enter Lord Lynton, Mrs. Vane, Emma Vane, Fitzerse, and Rosa.âSir George draws back.) ROSA, running up to Lady Grace. Aunt, I'm happy! I know you will forgive me. If you do not, I am so happy I'll wait patiently Until you do. (Kisses her.) FITZERSE. We must be both your debtors, Both grieving for your wrong. ROSA. And, Aunt, indeed You must be happy, too. This gentleman (showing Lord Lynton) Knows all. (Aside to Lord Lynton.) Why are you dumb? (Aloud.) I've told him all; And, being married, I may bring him to you, And call myself your chaperon for the nonce. LORD LYNTON, embarrassed. I am ashamed that I have doubted you. LADY GRACE. I think I am ashamed to face you all; You have my thanks, and I forget all wrongs, For I too have been busy for myself With happiness. (Gives her hand to Cranston; they all stand amazed.) SIR GEORGE, advancing. Her lawyer,ânothing more! Curtain falls. END OF ACT V. TWO EARLY POEMS. REVISED and REPRINTED. NOTE.âThe two Legends on which the following Poems are founded are suggested as poetical subjects in the notebook of Mrs. Hemans. THE MOTHER'S LESSON. All night she wept the hours away, With burning cheek and throbbing head, Crying, âAlas!â and âWell-a-day!â âWoe is me, for my sons are dead!â She could not rest, she could not sleep, She tossed in fever on her bed; She could not pray: she could but weep, âWoe is me, for my sons are dead!â As the weary hours went by, As the chimes rang heavily, That lonely one did shrink and start From the slow stern tread of misery Printing its footstep on her heart. Sometimes their names did in her brain Sound, and sound, and sound again, In a strange and ceaseless round, As though a whirling wheel were there, And every ruthless turn did tear A fresh and bleeding wound, Sometimes a trivial phrase or glance, With her deep grief at variance, Would in her memory rise; And there, it mocked her desolation By meaningless reiteration Of peevish fantasies, Like shape or pattern deftly wrought, Vexing a sick man's feverish thought. But never did she dare to see The faces of the newly dead Rise up before her memory By life and love retenanted; As shrinks the victim from the blade, Her spirit, helpless and afraid, Did from that vision shrink. No passing pain her sorrows were, No ancient and familiar care, But the bitterness of new despair, Which is afraid to think. And so she wept the hours away, And tossed in fever on her bed; She could not sleep, she could not pray, She could but wring her hands and say, âWoe is me, for my sons are dead!â Soft, and clear, and calm, and slow, Steals a sound upon her woe. It is the matin-bell! Dropping, like the gradual rain On some parched and lifeless plain, Sounds which in their fulness are Measured, deep, and regular; Strangely with her grief it blent, And a stranger softness lent To each tear that fell. She leaves her couch, she seeks her door, And far athwart the filmy night The coming day shines pale and grey, Like shadowy moonshine's colder light; The sleeping flowers forget to raise Their downcast heads to greet its gaze; All voiceless are the sheltering trees, Where birds should pour their melodies; The sheeted dew gleams white and wan, As if beneath the stars it shone; But still these chiming bells repeat Their matin warning, grave, and sweet. Slow to the church the mourner hied, Scarce conscious of the well-known way; The sacred doors are opened wide, She enters, and she kneels to pray; No torches flung their blaze aloof Upon the tall and arching roof; No taper shed its holier light On sculptured shrine and column white, But all along the ancient aisles, And by the tombs where slept the dead, O'er cavern niche and tracery rich, There seemed a solemn twilight spread, Clinging to cross and image pale, Like the clear folding of a veil. By that mysterious light she sees A multitude upon their knees, Shapes half familiar and half strange, Like friends that have endured a change; Antique in garb, they seemed a crowd Of worshippers from other lands, And every hidden face was bowed Upon the clasped and lifted hands, And not a sound of psalm or prayer Arose upon the vacant air. They moved no limb, they spake no word, Save inarticulate murmurs heard, Like leaves that in the wind are stirred, Or like the slumberous roll of seas When not a breath awakes the breeze. At once their faces all upraise! What sight hath chilled her with amaze? Lo, every face right well she knows, And some were friends and some were foes, And some were young and some were old, And some were kind and some were cold, And some were fair and some were brave, But ALL had long been in the grave. From early childhood's gladsome years, Down to this time of lonely tears, All she had known, loved, feared, and lost, Were round her in a solemn host, Wearing on every brow of gloom The paleness of its placeâthe tomb! Now on her feet the mother stood, With giddy brain and curdling blood, And now in frantic hope she scanned The younger faces of the band; But she sees not there the shining hair, And the cloudless eyes so clear and fair. She wrings her hands in fresh despair; She cries aloud, âIn vain! In vain! O, could I see my sons again!â A mighty sound the silence broke, The echoes of the aisles awoke, It was as if the organ spoke With voice articulate; âLook to the East!â it said, and ceased; Then through the vaulted space once more Went the dead silence as before, And all was desolate. The mourner turned, the mourner sawâ O sight of horror and of awe! There stood a block on the altar floor, And a fearful wheel by the sacred door, Whereon two hapless ones did lie, Wrestling with life's last agony! Each in prison-garb and guise, Each a youth just grown a man. Jesu! In their filmÃ¨d eyes, In their lips so cold and wan, Lo, the lineaments she traces Of her sons' remembered faces, Even as they perchance might grow After years of crime and woe! With staring eyes and clenching hands, Without a cry, a word, a groan, Motionless the mother stands, Like a sudden shape of stone, While again the silence breaks, And the mighty voice awakes: âMurmurer at the will of Heaven! Doubter of the love of God! See the life thou wouldst have given, See the path they must have trod! Now they sleep as infants sleep, Taken from the woes to come. Hence, poor wanderer, pray and weep! But thou, too, shalt find thy home!â Ceased the Voice, and over all Did a rapid darkness fall, Save for scattered rays that stream, With a dim and earthly gleam, From the lamp that mourner bore; While upon the marble floor, Fall, through windows arched and old, Streams of silver moonlight cold. Patiently she wept awhile, Patiently she prayed for grace, Till the comfort of a smile Settled on her placid face. Kneeling thus, she prayed she wept, Till it seemed as though she slept, For, by angel-fingers shed, Death's kind balm upon her head Dropped so gently. Tears, a few Of repentance, calm and meek, Glistened, as baptismal dew Glistens on an infant's cheek, Washing from the heart within Shades of grief and stains of sin. ODIN'S SACRIFICE. Thirty days have trickled by Since the grisly Plague drew nigh, Since he breathed into the woods, And the mountain solitudes, Soft recesses, spreading lights, Steadfast waters, purple heights, Such a spirit of despair You might see that Death was there. Thirty days from sun to sun, And so well the work is done Living men are not enow Even their dead to bury now; Yet unslaked is still his thirst, Arm unwearied as at first; All that toil of death so grim Seems but as a sport to him; Still he springs from prey to prey, Smiting thousands every day. Up and down the fields and streets Each man that his neighbour meets Hurries darkly from the place, Looking in that other face With a wild and shrinking eye, For he fears to see him die; But the women patient sit, Waiting death, not dreading it, For each one of them would fain Join some well-beloved again; Take this comfort, tearful throng, You have not to linger long! Not a sound is in the air Save before the Temple, where Some have gathered them for prayer Round about the walls they stand, With wan lip and shaking hand, For the priest is yet within; Ere those awful rites begin, He is kneeling by the throne Of the angry god alone,â Kneeling, till he wring reply From that dumb divinity. Six long days and nights, I ween, In the Temple hath he been Watching there 'twixt Life and Death, Gaunt with hunger, fierce with faith,â Watching with unquivering eyes From soft eve to keen sunrise, From clear dawn till day is spent, Till that ruthless god relent; Till he show by voice or hand Wherefore he afflicts the land, Till the lives to Odin due, Be they many, be they few, Can be counted down and paid That the pestilence be stayed. All the people wait without, In a mute and ghastly doubt, Till the priest's dread lips proclaim (Each expects) some fatal name; Each expects his own and fears As if death were in his ears, As if this poor life and cold Seems, when he must loose his hold, Like a sceptre and a crown Which a monarch must fling down. Lo! the dark gates stir and crack! All the waiting host shrinks back,â Back in senseless, speechless fear Of the thing which they must hear; Two or three break through and fly, Shrieking up against the sky With a wild and hollow shriek That makes white each hearer's cheek, If the cheeks death-pale before Can put on one whiteness more. But the king, who sate alone On a grey and mossy stone Nearest to the temple-gate, Shrank not from the word of fate; See, he lifts heroic eyes, Fearing nothing if he dies! Only one of that pale troop Had a soul that could not stoop, Only one a heart whose power Was sufficient for the hour; Hearts are frail when hope is gone,â Be we thankful there was one. âSpeak,â that kingly voice exclaimed, âSpeak, but ere thou speakest, hear! And the vow my soul hath framed Shall be uttered in thine ear. Let great Odin say his will, I that mandate will fulfil! Ay, though he bid me cast in dust The sword in which my people trust, And from my brow dishonoured tear The crown whose fitting place is there,â I will obey him still, and stand A throneless king in mine own land; And with your homage you may grace Another monarch in my place, If for such sacrifice he deign To grant my people health again. Speak, and I promise to obey! Speak, and I fling my crown away! Only kinghood from my heart Can but with my life depart.â Dumb the people listened; each Had a heart too full for speech. Dark the days when such a word Could be with such silence heard! Then the ruthless priest advanced, Slow his step, his eye entranced, As though still that vacant eye Communed with his deity; Wild and fast his utterance streams, Void of consciousness it seems, As if spoken among dreams; Other breath than his that hour Forces out the voice of power! The Priest's Speech. âOdin hath spoken! The king of heaven Answer dark to my prayer hath given; Odin hath spoken a fearful thing,â Hear, O people! and hear, O King! The vow ye but this moment heard Is in the far sky registered. Woe to him whose heart afraid Shuns the vow his lip hath made! Dreary life shall the doomed one lead, And his grasp, when life is fled, Never shall take the bowl of mead From the hand of the mighty dead; An honourless doom shall lay him low!â Woe, for my lips have said it, woe!â The wild priest tossed his arms on high, And his words went echoing through the sky, Through its wide blue wastes resounding go The doom of shame and the words of woe, Till all the people cower and quake As though Odin's voice in thunder spake. Then ceased that awful echo-strain, And the wild priest opened his lips again. The Priest's Speech continued. âWithin the Temple I watched alone, I lay before the war-god's throne; Night and day I fasted there, Night and day I lay in prayer, But still the god, tremendous, cold, Did stare upon me as of old; Never a sound and never a sign Answered all those prayers of mine, Till, as the sixth and latest night Gaped slowly for the sinking light, And one by one the shadows stole Like muttered spells across my soul, I rose and paced the dreary stone, Before the terrors of the throne, And shuddered while the cell I trod, Alone with the giant and speechless god! âWas it a cloud from the changing sky That cheated my bewildered eye? Not a voice nor a breath was heard, But it seemed to me that Odin stirred! My heart grew cold and shrank away, I thought he was coming to seize his prey, Down I fell and covered my face, Though night was darkening through the place, For I dared not turn nor lift my eye Lest I should see the god and die. There as I lay in the night alone, Hiding my face on the altar stone, A great Voice fell, as thunder falls, And clove the cloud and shook the walls, And the war-god uttered this word of fear,â Give ear, O people! O King, give ear!â The Decree of Odin. ââI loosened the bonds which bind The Pestilence, my slave; I sent him forth as the wind, I bade him stand in the midst of the land And make it one vast grave. ââWell hath his work been done, But he is working still, Scarce is the time begun, And the dead must sink and the living shrink Till achieved is Odin's will. ââTake from the King his best, The creature next his heart; Then shall the land have rest, Then will I chain the fierce Plague again. I have said the word. Depart!ââ The tones of that strange voice have ceased, Mute are the people and the priest, But a weight of horror lies On their wild and wistful eyes. Silently they stood and heard, But, as died the last dread word, A greyness like a sudden cloud Fell on some of that pale crowd, As if a stormcloud left its trace Upon each uplifted face; Yet the sky is calm and fair, Not a passing mist is there; Each man on his neighbour gazed, Questioning and sore amazed. Past that moment's shuddering doubt, âThe plague, the hideous plague!â they shout; And some take flight, and some stand still; But the grasp of death is icy chill, One touch goes freezing to their hearts, And hurrying life recoils, departs, Till the steps beside the temple door Are piled with corpses o'er and o'er, And the monarch veils his face, and cries, âGreat Odin, take thy sacrifice!â There stood a child at the monarch's knee, A fair and bright-haired boy was he; His young blue eyes had never yet Aught save the glance of kindness met, Nor save with passing tears been wet; His heart like some fresh rosebud grew, Nourished with gentle beams and dew; His lisping tongue had never known Aught save a blithe and fearless tone; Wonder and terror he now might feel, But his father's arm was a fence of steel; He was the child of hope and care, The only one and the kingdom's heir, And he thought as he stood at his father's knee, âThere is none on earth that can injure me!â But the ruthless priest drew near With an eye whose gaze was felt, An eye that never shed a tear, And a heart that could not melt; He laid his grasp on the child's soft neck, And the father shuddered but dared not check, He lifted the knife,âbut the princely child, Looked lightly up in his face and smiled; Each cheek around was white with woe, But the boy's blue eye no fear confest; It was his father who let him go, So he held it all for a passing jest. Whence came that shriek which rings around? A heart is breaking in the sound! 'Tis not the child, he is smiling still Into the face of the man of ill; 'Tis not the sire, the hero sits With a heart that speaks not, but submits His eyes are hard and bright as steel, You would not dream that he can feel. Whose is this darting form that flies, Swift as the flash from thunder-skies, With floating hair, with glittering eye, Whose beauty is lost in agony? Make way, make way for that form so wild! It is the mother of the child! She hath caught the boy to her breast, One moment's quick embrace, Wildly and closely his form she prest, But she dared not see his face; One look had taken her strength away For the deed she had to do that day; So she turned away when her strong clasp ceased, And thus she spake to the ruthless priest. âMan of blood, thou hast strangely erred, If Odin's will aright was heard; Not dear, but dearest was his quest, The King must give the god his best. Away from the innocent babe! away! I am the victim thy sword must slay. I am the love of his youth; we changed Hearts which no after-chill estranged; I am the wife of his bosom; see, His cheek is losing its glow for me, The light grows dim in his eagle eye, His brow forgetteth its royalty. I am the dearest, for I can chase The soul of strength from the hero's face; Look how he shrinks! how pale, how wild! He changed not thus when you touched his child!â The priest stood still; there seemed a trace Of transient pity on his face,â With breathless heart, with trembling knees, That moment's pause the mother sees; No monarch crowned with victory's wreath E'er clung to life as she to death. Whiter and whiter her cheek hath grown, As she turned to the king and thus spake on. âDost thou not love me?â she said, and soft Was her young low voice, and it quivered oft; The light in her eye was troubled, yet 'Twas not with a single teardrop wet; Those waters of the heart's pure well Were frozen in their deepest cell. âDost thou not love me? Forgettest thou When first I gave thee my girlish vow? Hast thou forgotten that old bright time, When two true hearts were together twining? Hast thou forgotten Love's dewy prime Now, when his noon is around thee shining? Will thy cold eyes no change evince? Have I been faithless to thee since? Have I not still, as thine own true wife, Smiled on thy manhood's sterner life? And has not love in our two hearts made A world of youth that can never fade? Did ever a breath of unkindness pass Over our peaceful lake of love? Did it not mirror as a glass The tranquil glories from above? O! by the hours of joy and stillness Which our true wedded faith hath known, Turn not away with such icy chillness, Turn not away,âI am still thine own! Or has some false new love proved stronger? Hast thou a dearer face than mine? Speak to me, speak! Are we one no longer? Dost thou not love me? Am I not thine?â The voice of her passionate pleading died As a low breeze dies by a river side, But ere that low breeze sank to rest It woke a storm in the monarch's breast. Up he sprang, and men dared not see How the great heroic soul gave way,â How the brow grew dark with agony And the lips with terror ashen-grey; Faint was his voice and of faltering tone, âGudruna! Gudruna! come back, mine own! Touch her not, priest! She is mine! Forbear! Take ye the child, but the mother spare!â âHeard ye? Oh, heard ye?â the mother cries, And quick tears break from her joyful eyes; âMy prayer is granted, my truth is proved! Take me,âfor I am his best beloved!â Eager she spake, and hurried where The priest was lifting his knife in air! In her own life-blood she lies,â She lies at the monarch's feet, And her heart looks up into his eyes With a loving gaze and sweet; In dumb despair he stands, He stretches helpless hands, Looks from her face to the iron sky, And knows that he must see her die! For Death is glazing fast Those eyes of tenderest blue, And now come gentle wordsâthe lastâ Hurried and faint and few; One moment, one poor breath She wrings from coming Death, And a faint tinge trembles on her cheeks As thus her dying love she speaks: âGrieve not for me, O! dearest one, Forget not how I fell, The mother for her firstborn son,â My heart's beloved, farewell! What bliss was for your darling kept, To live so loved and die so wept!â Her spirit passed with the last soft word, And a voice of weeping around was heard; The monarch clasped his wondering boy, And hid his face in the child's bright hair, He would not that his people's eye Should look upon his first despair. Where she fell they buried her, And the mountain rose's bloom Clustered round to minister Sweetness to her lonely tomb; And the breeze at morn and eve Ever loved to linger there With its gentlest breath to grieve Over one so pure and fair; And for many an after year All that sorrowing people came, Casting garlands on her bier, Doing honour to her name; For the pestilence had ceased, And grim Odin was appeased. Never did the monarch take Other maiden for his bride; Lonely lived he for her sake, Lonely at the last he died; How could any other be Half so fond and true as she?</field>
