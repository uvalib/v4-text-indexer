      <field name="fulltext">I DEDICATE THESE POEMS TO MY MOTHER'S MEMORY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO E. C. My deep need of thy love, its mast'ring power, I scarce can fathom, thou wilt never know; My lighter passions into rhythm may glow; This is for ever voiceless. Could the flower Open its petall'd thought, and praise the dower Of sunlight, or the fresh gift of the dew, The bounteous air that daily round it blew, Blessing unweariedly in sun and shower, Methinks would miss its praises: so I drink My life of thee; and put to poet's use Whatever crosses it of strange or fair. Thou hast fore-fashioned all I do and think; And to my seeming it were words' abuse To boast a wealth of which I am the heir. THE NEW MINNESINGER. (âThink of womanhood; and thou to be a woman.â) O Woman, all too long by thee Love's praises have been heard; But thou to swell the minstrelsy Hast brought no wealth'ning word. Thou who its sweetest sweet canst tell Heart-trainÃ¨d to the tongue, Hast listen'd to its music well But never led the song! The world, through countless ages roll'd, Hath given us but in part, But in tradition faintly told The love-lore of thine heart. Long hath the study been pursued, Nay, ere his brain began Its toil and tent solicitude, It was essayed of man. And all of it that he can con, With toil and study true, He hath deep-mus'd and thought upon, Mislearnt, and learnt anew; Till losing through confusÃ¨d will The grace, the touch divine, His own too worldly-busy skill Hath wrought his art's decline. Dear, Eden-dated, heavenly art, Ne'er doom'd of God to fall, These woman-lips, so slow to part, Thy glory shall recall! Yes, Woman, she whose life doth lie In virgin haunts of poesie,â How have men woven into creeds The unrecorded life she leads! What she hath been to them, oh, well The whole sweet legend they can tell; But what she to herself may be They see not, or but dream they see. Content with what they touch and feel, As from a violet we steal Its sweet heart-odour; thinking so That we its inmost being know; And never learn what to the flower Hath been the springtide's op'ning hour; What winds have whisper'd, what the dew Hath spoken, how the heaven's blue Smil'd promise, when the timid thing, Leaf-folded, dream'd of blossoming. Yet it were worth our while to know How fare the flowers before they blow; To learn the low-breath'd life that's past In snowy may-blooms, shut so fast. Mid soothings of soft shaded light, Warm creeping through the curtain'd white, What deep security! what calm! What fragrance of close-petall'd balm! But slowly do the leaves unfold, And chang'd the flower when we behold; As chang'd as maiden in her prime From that dim, early-growing time When, happy with herself at play, Amid warm nestling hopes she layâ Such blameless hopes! they did not shoot Like older hopes from sorrow's root; No sharpen'd blast of outer breath Brought to their promise blight or death; But op'ning in the very air That wooed their buds, they blossom'd fair. Ah, would she but to us rehearse Her first girl-life in April verseâ A fairer spring-tide would be ours Than e'er across the woodland flowers. And those first dreams of dawning told, While yet the sky is paly gold, And she half-slumb'ringâwill she then Tell of that spirit-wakening, when O'er her soft opal heaven is shed Love's first faint flush of morning red? Yes, will she to the world disclose, Not the fair seeming and the shows, The pretty masks that still she wears, The wiles, the Eve-descended airs; But will she ever give us part Of the deep workings of her heart, When suddenly she finds before Its all unheeded, open door A stranger, clad in pilgrim weeds, Whose homeless state and simple needs Ask courtesy and kindly care, Which he wins of her unaware, Meek suppliant! and then reveals The lofty rank her roof conceals, And urges secrecy, and lays Constraint on all her guileless ways? Her free, frank life she puts aside, Careful her kingly charge to hide, And guessing dimly thro' her fear How the new durance groweth dear; Tho' angry thoughts hot protest make, Sore questioning why she should take In her unquiet heart to rest This captive, regnant, royal guest, Who must be homaged, must be hid, Till, conscience-goaded, conscience-chid, Almost she wishes him away, Almost she could her trust betray, Then closer shuts the house, lest e'en A peep of treasonous thought be seen. And may we learn the bliss, the pride, When she's no longer forc'd to hide Her secret sovereign, but when he May in full daylight thronÃ¨d be; When with a very little thingâ The mother's kiss, the troth plight ringâ Her guilty wonderment, her dread Of secret chamber'd thoughts, is fled. No longer of her love afraid, Her narrow prison-cell new made To sainted chapel, now she ne'er Need cease from service and from prayer; Sweet worship there she offers:âpraise, Full pomp of rite on holy days, And quietly, when none are by, Pours out her heart's idolatry; And feeds the lamp, and tends the flower, Meek vigil keeps at midnight hour, And joins with matin chimes the throng She worships openly among. And, when soul-summon'd, at the last She bids farewell to all her past, Oh, may we stand to see her start On those strange travels of the heart, When, growing restless, ill at ease, In homely Ur of the Chaldees, She turns, most Abraham-like, to go To a far country he will show Who is her Promise, Covenant, Call; For whom she leaves her girlhood, all The happy plains and pastures sweet Fleck'd with the track of childhood's feet, Fragrant with all the bliss that she Hath known from earliest infancy; Her goal, where he directs alone; She leaves the lov'd, familiar, known, For rose-lit rims of hills that gleam On far horizons half in dream. She goes, and God her path doth bless, Her faith is counted righteousness. She goes to pilgrim's fare and pain, To woe and loss, and endless gain, To doubt, misgiving, gladsome cheer, High hope, and sudden blight of fear: She goes, oh, not to heavenly peace, Calm settlement, and toil's surcease, But fierce, strange peoples to withstand Even within the Promised Land: She goes a worship high to hold 'Mong brazen bulls and calves of gold, To break down many an idol show, To suffer much, and much forego, Nor haply, e'er her sun decline, To sit beneath the promised vine. Yet not for years in sorrow spent Will she a moment's span repent That Faith's fair prowess made her dare Claim that untravers'd country, where (As she sweet Canaan's conqueror knows) Alone life's milk and honey flows. Lone songs of girlhood, loftier lays, Rich-noted, fuller-toned, to praise The life new-margin'd, flowing wide With a fresh water's mingling tide, We ask of her; and then we call For a new song most sweet of allâ A Song of Songs! but can it be, O Earth, long list'ning Earth, that she Hath hushed thy children's cries so long, Nor given the world one cradle song! Yea, even thus. All mothers know Those brooding notes, those wailings low That our new wearied mother Eve, Her nursing daughterhood did leaveâ Half sighs, and half caresses! still Their faint, sad music seems to fill Our childhood's air, as woodland breeze Melodious with the minstrel trees; But still poor broken lays, that bring Scant glory to the love they sing. That tell how woman's love doth make Herself a child for children's sake: Full of vain babblings, murmurings vain, And snatches of too fond refrain; But of that vaster love and deep That lies about a baby's sleep, That gives the heart prophetic fire, Deep-passion'd prayers, and high desireâ Of these soul-reachings in no wise We learn through earth's old lullabies. O Woman, can she e'er complain Of straiten'd lot in song's domain, Having as dower of highest good The whole wide realm of motherhood? Having on human souls a claim That through all ages is the same: No newer love can thrust aside, No sad soul-wand'ring e'er divide. From the first promise and the pain Her children ever hers remain; Most hers, when children's children show How far the sacred fire can glow, And lips, new-bath'd in mother's bliss, Return the primal mother's kiss. Fain would we listen to her song, Her tender nursling flowers among: Voice of the turtle would we hear The fragrant lily-fields anear. Fresh from the wild woods, with the scent Of purest life her being's blent; And yet with all that nature sweet Blooming, rich scatter'd, at her feet, Scarcely one flower-bud will she sing Of all its countless blossoming. Unchronicled her native bliss, All spoil of travel she must miss. The poet learns at home his art, Woos it and weds, and if he part, 'Tis but, as traveller's wont, to yearn O'er the lost pleasures and return; But she, heart-errant, doth not prize The fair realms where her queendom lies; Courts empery in higher place, Asks broader paths, and ampler space; And seeks among life's busy throng A swifter cadence to her song Than e'er can tune itself to lays Sung by life's bracken-hinder'd ways. And if, we ask it with a sigh, The time, the happy time's gone by When she, home-homag'd, must be known By household gift and grace alone; If she must sing of other theme Than Love, or waking or in dream, Yet must she harbour none the less Care of her ancient blessedness. Sage-sued, world-beckon'd, she must be Full woman: lifted to a free And fellow-life with man. No more Must she creep dumbly as of yore Adown the ages; but her word Must, as man's echo, ne'er be heard. How high soe'er her thought may reach Still it must flow through woman's speech In woman's fashion; only so Can the twinn'd lives unhind'ring grow. The woman's wayâwe count her blameâ Must be her glory-crown, her fame: And far in after ages, when She shares life's loftier toil with men, Oh, never must she cast aside Her early grace through growing pride, Nor, foreign-cultur'd, leave behind The native instincts of her kind! Chosen by Nature's self to be A consecrated ministry, All needful knowledge to impart In the fair scriptures of the heart, Aye must she count her priestly name Outhonours every earthly fame; And whatsoe'er new gain she reap, What realm encloseth, ever keep All things subservient to the good Of pure, free-growing womanhood. YOUTH TIME. Yes, I sing thee my English songs, my Love, Thou canst listen their music now; Thou wert born in a far distant land, my Love, And all dumbly thou woo'dst and didst win me, my Love, Didst win me I know not how; For our hearts had but mystic 'trothal, my Love, And were plighted without a vow. Thy mother, she sang English songlets, my Love, To the boy on her cradling knee; And now thou art gone to her home above (As we know but one language to those we love) She may speak the old tongue to thee: And the trick of the sweet mother speech, my Love, It may mind thee in heaven of me. SONGS. I. They lov'd thee dear, they mourn'd thee dead; Time flies and they forget: To me no pitying word was said; I had no right one tear to shed, And I remember yet! The happy ones thou lov'dst so well Thy memory have forgot; But I, brief friend, who scarce can tell, Or if thou lov'dst, or lov'dst me well, Lo, I forget thee not. So sweet the very thought of thee Illumes my earthly lot, I care not wheresoe'er I be, Or rich or poor, or bond or free, So I forget thee not! II. And how did I know thou lov'dst me? So tell me how it can be The bird hath broodings of summer From the lands beyond the sea? And how did I know I lov'd thee; Sweet love, so tell me what brings The sudden passion, the yearning, The throb to the folded wings? O the little birds fly blindly To their home across the sea; As I to the endless summer Deep-hid in thy heart for me! III. The purple violets for me Their sweetness had outprest, And with my sweet love's memory I laid their sweet to rest; And round my heart I felt it cling, Till passing, later on, A bank of bluer blossoming From which the scent had gone, The mocking sight so griev'd my sense, I felt it tear away The wealth of folded redolence That in my bosom lay. I lov'd thee so, with every scene In which thy love had part, Sweet memories of what had been Were folded to my heart. I went to gather fresher store From haunts that used to be So sweet, so passing sweet, before, So fragrant full of thee. I saw, but oh not what I sought, And now shall see no more In rapture of memorial thought The scene so sweet before! IV. Could I but give to other eyes What most hath raptur'd mine, Then were my life's fair memories By sweet transition thine. For thee from things of outer gain 'Tis not enough to part; I long to give thee what hath lain All close about my heart. The scenes I travell'd far to see That in my life have wrought The dream, the golden fantasy, The touch of finer thought. But though I stripped my sweetest years Of their full store of bliss, Oh yet I fear my love appears But miserly in thisâ That I, Sapphira-like in stealth, Should yield not all I prize; Unwilling to forego the wealth Won from thy bounteous eyes. And while I keep their sunset kiss, Their calm of twilight gray, No other memory I could miss Though all were stole away! V. âGeistern bin ich noch verbunden.â Spirit, thou wand'rest, But tell me where? I go to the graveyard And weep thee there; I've sought thee in visions, But vainly sought; Thou com'st not in dreams to My waking thought. To memory's solace I idly flee: The past is precious, But past to thee. And mock'd, and scorning A search so vain, I look all whither The way to gain (That strangely, darkly Thou seem'st to hide) To thee, the living, The long-denied! No terrors chill me, No fleshly dread; Though thou wert number'd Among the dead, And now, new-risen, Wert strangely fair, My love's confiding Thou could'st not scare. Through heaven's disguises I still should greet What made the eyes and The lips so sweet. Spirit, thou wand'rest, But tell me where? My thoughts are waiting, My love is there! Or, if thou fearest The veil to break, Some subtler path to My spirit take. I wander darkling; But oh the blind Without the sunlight No summer find! My eyes are holden; But still I ask In golden warmth of Thy love to bask. Let me but feel thee About my heart; Let us not linger A life apart! Spirit, thou wand'rest, But tell me where? Lest Faith, heart-broken, Become Despair! VI. I think of thee over and over again; The words of thy silence, the words thou hast said; And the memory comes with a throb of pain, As milk to the bosom, the baby dead. O 'twas sweet to think of thee over again, When over again thou could'st think of me; But now I am lonely, my travel vain, When tearful I turn to the past for thee. Yet ne'er must thou think of me over again, So lonely, so longing, with heart so sore; From thine eyes all the shadow, the grief be ta'en, While mine, let them weep for thee more and more. But, love, if e'er loverwise over again, In some dim afartime of life we meet; If e'er, rich with a myriad-worlded gain, We find the old lore of our childhood sweet, If the heart's home-memories may still remain, And the flowers bloom fresh that on earth we grew, We'll think of it over and over again, Of the olden love that is chang'd to new. VII. The sun is down, but the sky Is thinking about him yet; But after the sun was down, the sky remained thinking about him. âSeaboard Parish, p. 155. The clouds wear the rosy dye That they wore before he set. Thou art gone; but a light from thee To my inmost soul doth shine; And the end of my life must be That men should remember thine. My songs are the rosy cloud All bath'd in the sunbeams' glow, While the sun is wrapp'd in his shroud By the darksome waves below. BITTER-SWEET. O roses that for her are sweet! O scent of new-mown hay! O grand old chestnuts, at whose feet The happy children play! What bitter memories ye may be, What memories bitter-sweet; Again beneath the chestnut tree The little ones may meet; The roses bloom in pinken spray 'Mid briary thickets fair; But she who made the summer-day May be no longer there. O what, an' if the roses red, The hay about our feet, Should mind us of the darling dead For whom they once were sweet! THE WIND. The wind it may roar in the forest, And stir up the stormy deep, If it do not cry round the cradle, Where my little one lies asleep. The rain it may beat on the casement, If it do not grow too wild, To trouble the angel laughter From the dreaming brow of my child. The wind it may wail in the woodland, And sob to the sighing wave, If it do not scatter the daisies From their home on my little one's grave. The rain it may trickle down softly To make green the grassy nest; So it wake not to weeping the sleeper So far from her mother's breast. LOVES NEW AND OLD. Larch-blooms and violets. If loving nature us allow To ask a springtide sign, Thy tiny cresset lamps, I trow, Bright shining larch, are mine! I cannot feel the sun is near, Nor gladden, till I see The lustre on thy boughs, thou dear, Bold-hearted, highland tree! How fearless thou dost round thee fling Thy tender sprays! I ween The very joyaunce of the spring Lurks in thy laughing green! A child I lov'd thee for thy hue, Tir'd of the winter glooms, But, city-nurtur'd, never knew The glory of thy blooms. This happy spring, in golden stealth Of April gleams, didst thou Reveal the unsuspected wealth Hung on each glowing bough. I caught the flash of jewell'd light, I glanced across the stems, Crown'd to thy turret's topmost height With tiers of living gems. O joy of a fresh found delight In woodland or in field, That far in seasons out of sight Its sweet return will yield! Not mine to store, nor mine to be With miser's fear afraid; To endless happy springs for me A treasure was uplaid. And this new bliss my spirit greets With glad discovering claim; Unlike those blind mysterious sweets That with my childhood came. The first blue violets! with their scent What sudden memories spring; They bring to me that strange content Born of remembering. To me of other springs they speak, Of friends that I have known; Though hand in hand I used to seek What now I seek alone; I find them in their hiding-place With a recovered glee; I love them as I love the face That I am used to see. I learnt them, like my mother's eyes, Their sweetness ere their name; But these a very love surprise Across my vision came. And which the sweeter? to be fed From springs we cannot see, Or be ourselves the fountain head Of our own bliss to be? The loves we childish drink, nor heed From whence the fountains fill; The loves whose broadest margins lead Back to the tiny rill? THE QUIET LIGHT. After the sunset, Before the night, There comes a season Of quiet light. After the dying, Before the death, There comes a drawing Of quiet breath. Hush of the daylight, O whisper why That childlike breathing Before we die! THE HAYFIELD. âThe last load is carried, The meadow is mown; Then why on the scythe-track Still wanderest lone? âThe high-loaded wagon Has wound round the hill; But thou in the valley Art lingering still. âDost think of the voices So cheery, so blithe? The bloom on the grasses? The sweep of the scythe? âThe joy of the children A-rock on the hay? The wind-wafted fragrance? The laughter, the play?â âThe high-loaded wagon Has wound round the hill; But I in the valley Am lingering still, âTo think of their sorrow, Whose day's work is done, Who are not called homeward At set of the sun. âWhose life's tale is ended, Or e'er the life close; To think, for a moment, How bitter for those âWho in the bare stubble Must still linger on; The burdens all carried, The comrades all gone.â THE CRESCENT MOON. How faint a glow the early moon Gives to the evening skies! O love, 'tis like the crescent light I saw within thine eyes, When first I looked into their depths, With troubled heart, to know If from so slight a promise e'er Love's golden prime could grow. But e'en that faintly-gleaming moon, Across the blue, behold! Her fair completion unfulfilled Hath limned in tenderest gold. And with that little golden ring A sudden hope doth rise; I look beyond the crescent light Of those soft-shining eyes, And now that I may nearer gaze, Across their blue I see, All limned in tenderest lines of love, My perfect bliss to be. AFTER THE RAIN. Whatever haunting care of life About my spirit cleaves, If I but walk abroad awhile Among the breathing leaves, It seems as it were left behind Beneath the cottage eaves. I do not ask for singing birds, Or floods of golden light; For if I do but ope the door On a dull autumn night, The shining rain-drops on the grass Will set my spirit right. TO AN INFANT DYING WHEN NINE DAYS OLD. Newly-born, and newly dead, Of life disinherited; From its joyaunce and its grief, In thy sojourn all so brief, Hath it gather'd germ of good, Thy scarce conscious babyhood? Through faint memories canst thou tell Aught of what on earth befell? Dimly, darkly, wilt thou miss Lullaby and mother's kiss? And a brooding want confess 'Midst the angelic blessedness? Little lips now shut so fastâ Lips no human word hath past, SealÃ¨d ears, that never heard Rush of river, song of bird, Eyes that were too tired to look At life's wondrous picture-book; Senses fine! what have ye found Sweet in speech, and sight, and sound, What new earth, and sky, and sea, Dawns, O baby-soul, to thee? Little ark-freed eager dove, Loos'd from our fast-prisoning love, Though thou joy'st thy wings to try In the summer-breathing sky, Yet a little space return; For our hearts with passion burn For the tidings thou could'st bring Lightly on thy carrier wing. Thou, the child of yesterday, Hast o'erta'en us on our way; Thou art nigh to things that we See far off in mystery. Clearest light to thee doth shine, Where we wonder, or divine; For, a nine day's traveller, thou Hast o'ertopp'd the mountain's brow, Whilst we, way-worn wanderers, press Upward still in weariness. But when all, both first and last, To the great Beyond have past, When the many-nation'd band Touches the all-havening land, Thou wilt feel that one is there Known to thee some other where: One, amid the stranger throng, Unto whom thou dost belong; To whose happy owning eyes Something in thy heart repliesâ Something rising to the pain Of a memory sought in vain, Of a bliss thou would'st recall Missing it afresh, till all The forgotten tale is told, As the eager arms enfold, And the lips, with low-breath'd name, Their brief motherhood reclaim. A MOTHER. (AFTER THE BIRTH OF HER STILL-BORN SON.) They call me a mother, but cold Are the chrism lips of my child: On him was the pow'r bestow'd, The sinless, the undefil'd, To make me that name, whose sound Is an empty title now: I sit as a queen uncrown'd; And yet to this sunless brow, Bereft of its bridal light, With sorrow all bowÃ¨d down, He giveth the royal right To womanhood's glory crown. I miss him, I know not where He hath no place to be miss'd; This one little lock of hair, From the brow I have not kiss'd, But tells me it all is trueâ This bliss that hath never been: Brown hair! did it match the hue Of those eyes I have not seen? In my life he had no part, Yet now hath left me alone; The very font of my heart Baptis'd him my child, my own. And I am his chosen still, For me are the child-like eyes; His want 'tis my wealth must fill; To my heart his heart replies. The secret soft-falling touch, The want-earned pleasure and pain, Ah we two had learn'd so much If in my arms he had lain! I shall not cradle him so; These arms will never enfold; My unspent passion will grow, Like my baby, dead and cold. Nay, both of us now must miss A love each keepeth in store, Till God sets us free to kiss And the precious nard outpour. UNREGENERATE? Thou hast not breathed this mortal air, Whose breathing bringeth sin; Clean as the heavens thou art, but there They will not let thee in. Go little pilgrim pure and white, Seek thou the heavenly gate; I have not read my God aright, If long thou there must wait. Nay, He and I must strangers be, If, for His pity's sake, My little orphan'd Purity He will not stoop to take, THE THRUSH'S NEST. âAs snow in summer.â âProv. 'Twas in those fairest vernal days That come before the time, And sudden reckless hopes will raise Of summer's golden prime,â The wind that wander'd from the west With blossom-scent was fill'd, When the too eager thrush her nest Impetuous 'gan to build. The open sky, the soften'd air All frosty fear belied; She saw the greening bough prepare Her treasur'd home to hide. To her glad eyes for love's fair feast All things were ready made: With each new sun her faith increast, And four blue eggs were laid. And when her hardy bliss to spy With noiseless step we came, The brightness of her patient eye Put all our fears to shame; But yet we feared. The sky grew gray, And, ere we turned to go, Lo, on a budding twig there lay The first flake of the snow! Full soon that fragile house was beat With gusts of snowy rain: Through weary days of blinding sleet We thought of it in pain. The air was clear'd; we found the nest A shelterless abode, Where for the mother's brooding breast The snowy flakes were strowed. For cradle-bed such coverlet 'Twas piteous to see! That sight I never can forget Of orphan misery. And she, ah she who thought to make A home of happy cheer, 'Twas for a dearer sorrow's sake Her grief to me was dear. Who hath not felt her bitter smart, And like the mother-bird With too improvident a heart Love's holy prompting heard? Who when the clouds begin to break Forbears bright hopes to weave? From which, 'neath darken'd heavens, he'll take A broken-hearted leave. How many promises of spring To summer joys would grow, If life but brought the warming wing And not the winter snow! APPLE-BLOOM. âBloom on the apple, How cam'st thou there?â Because the sunshine Did not despair; But play'd and beamed on My sullen green, Threw golden kisses As long as seen; And rose the morrow A monarch still, With pride in patience To work his will; And greeted and glanc'd with A subtler grace, That yester touches Had left no trace. With fuller hope on Each morning came, Uprose in splendour And sank in flame: Shot burning arrows Of tropic heat; Or fell in sun showers All mellow sweet. Anon would threaten, Anon beguile, Drop down a mist-wreath A sudden smile; The black'ning veil of The clouds burst through, And hang in jewels My drops of dew; Nor through the summer Forbore to seek, But left unrosy My pale-hued cheek. The softer fruitage In crimson shone; But its rubied glory Had come and gone, Ere a warmer tincture, A softer grain, Gave tender hope of The scarlet stain; To bring that hope to Its golden prime The sunlight tarried: And won, what time The southern grape takes Its purple flush, The first faint sign of A promis'd blush. âSong of the poet, How cam'st thou there?â Because his spirit Did not despair. The thought was golden, But O the doom In words to picture That inmost bloom! The thought was sunshine, But could it reach The thick-ribbed core of Resisting speech? The happy lover When first he knows To his lady's cheek he Can bring the rose, Will bid the colour Responsive rise To own the power of His passion's sighs. But O the poet His bliss to earn, With deeper fervour Of heart must burn; Must wait and linger, And labour still, With toil recurrent To work his will: Must bear in patience The blinding screen, The earthborn curtain That comes between His own bright thought and Its outer form, In mist of stupor Or cloud of storm: With quicken'd ardour Of hope assail, More slow to falter The more he fail: Inured by hindrance To brook delays, Must watch the flowing Of fruitless days With fever'd heart-throb, Yet keep the same Foremeasur'd calmness Of master-aim; Till, fully tempted, And train'd to bear All subtle guises Of spirit-care, As frosty touches Begin to steal On his waning life, he Perchance may feel The piercing power of His brain burst through, To clothe dull word with His passion's hue: Till 'mong the fibres Of speech be wrought The rosy blush of His vision'd thought. THE EVENING PRIMROSE. The day had been hot, and all weary I turn'd down the shady walk; I paused by the blooming flower-bed, But not with the flowers to talk; I look'd not for word or welcome; The dews had begun to fall; And I knew that to simple flowerets The dew is a curfew call. So lone down the shady border I turn'd away from the heat, Nor knew that the evening primrose Was waiting my steps to greet. The full June flowers were sleeping As sick of the summer glare; But she of the smile new-lighted, And the morning face was there. And joyous I sat beside her, Around her in love I leant, For I felt she was sister-hearted To the lonely life I spent. From the garish world close-petall'd, And sheltering from the sun, She opens to skiey converse When the weary day is done. She parteth her golden petals, For joy of the first lone star; And a blest communion seeketh With the silent and the far. Oh, like to the evening primrose Is this quiet muse of mine! She keeps close-shut from the sunlight, But lo, with the day's decline, She opens her paly blossoms To the solemn evening skies; And glad, as 'neath lover's glances, 'Neath the deep'ning heaven lies. Aye loving the folding shadows, And the lonesome starry shine, Most like to the evening primrose Is this quiet muse of mine. THE GRASS OF THE FIELD. Oh, the sweet green grass is dear to me, I lie in it all day long; I love it better than flower or tree, And tell my love in a song. I love it better than all the flowers; It doth not wither nor fade, But patiently waits through wintry hours The joy of the springing blade. The hard-bred grass doth not fear to brave The roughest storms that may blow: It keeps a warm covert round the grave, Far under the chilling snow. And therefore 'tis grown so dear to me, It seems a half-human thing: By hillock and hedgerow, moor and lea, It greets me, where'er it spring;â The mountain grass so mossy and fine, The crimson meads, ere the mowing, The pastures sprinkled with buttercup shine, The wheat in the early growing. The long reed-bed that borders the streams, The half-bleach'd blades by the sea; The glow of the orchard turfâits gleams Of snowy bloom from the tree. The wind-swept sheaf all rich with the rain, Or jewell'd in shining dew, The meadow-blooms that the scythe hath ta'en, And the sun hath sweeten'd anew. O grass of the hayfield! O clover breath! O fragrance they did not know In Eden, or e'er there was toil or death, Or scythe that should lay thee low! There is a fragrance that comes with the fall; Though the bread be labour-born, The joy of the harvest outgladdens all The pain of thistle or thorn. What makes the sunset so golden sweet Is the toil it bids us leave: The workday fields for the noontide heat! The cool green hills for the eve! The roadside grass to sweeten the way That our weary feet must tread; And oh, the dear earthy turf to lay At last round the restful head! EYES Thine eyes are like new-open'd flowers, So fresh, so dewy-bright, Their very darkness but embowers The secret of the light. No restless fire is theirs, no doubt Of some sweet heart to win; Enough for them the world without, The fairer world within. They do not ask for human gaze, For tears, for passion's sighs; No tender doubtful hopes they raise, Those clear, deep-blossom'd eyes. But O they wear the springtide's smile, And must for ever keep! They may be shadow'd for a while, A little while in sleep: But other shadow must not e'er Their morn-like beauty cloud; And deathâit must not ever dare Their lovely lights to shroud. Oh, if I were the golden sun Whose warmth around them glows, I could not set when day was done For fear my flowers should close! MIDNIGHT THOUGHTS OF MORNING. When I wake not to moon or stars, Or soft-cheek'd pallor of night; When my weary and baffled eyes Feel after the restful light And can find no relic of day, No promise of morning beam; When the raven robe of the night Is woven without a seam, Then I close up my dark-fill'd eyes In their dark, and tears, and tire, And paint them, on spirit skies, The dawning of their desire. Though the light of the eyes be gone, The heart in the East may be; For faith looketh further on Into immortality. THE LILY. In rudest season frailest things All timidly creep forth; The very sweetest flower that springs Is nurtur'd by the north. The rough north wind with tender heart His pretty nurslings rears; The poor affrighted buds to part He shakes away their fears. I am, O lily-shrinking flower, The wilding wind that blows, Intent, although my blossom cower, Its petals to unclose. SUNBREAK. Ah, what hast thou given me, what hast thou done? Thou'st wrought the sweet task of the life-giving sun. Before thine outbreaking, how long had I lain All coweringly closed from the sleet and the rain. But thou, with thy sun-breath, art come, and I lie Wide petall'd and warm to the full glowing sky! TO-MORROW. What is to-morrow? To morrow's a day When one will be near Who is far away. When a face will look young That was looking old; When a heart will beat high That was growing cold. When quicken'd memories With hopes will meet, And the past of the future Foretell all sweet. What is to-morrow? To-morrow's best Lies folded already Within my breast. The feast in the vigil We fitliest keep; For joy of the waking I scarce can sleep. To waken and wonder What joy is born, Then find that To-morrow Is come with the morn. To-morrow, to-morrow! So sweet to say! To think it will ever Be yesterday! LOVE AND WINE. I knew that first love was a new-graped wine That best in the dark would keep; I had a safe-hiding heart, and mine I buried there, oh so deep! I said: From the light it must needs escape, And remain untasted so, Till the sun-warm bloom of the rounding grape Through its inner fruitage glow. It was not press'd for a passing thirst; A short-lived want to allay; For a life-long passion of need it was nurst, For a far-off festal day. I bade it in darkness grow bright and strong, Through memory, and loss, and dearth: Change, ferment, transition, it suffered long, Then pass'd, through a second birth, Into fixÃ¨d sunshine, and odour fine Its fuller life to express: Oh, I ne'er had hoarded the new-made wine, My love, had I lov'd thee less! But now it is bloom-flush'd, and fragrant, and sweet, And I, from this heart of mine, Can draw for thy lips a drink-offering meet: Ah, now thou canst ask for wine! THE NEW YEAR. New sources for our weeping, New well-springs for our bliss; New faces in their fairness, New fading ones to miss. New whispers from the violet, Fresh song-breaths from the bird; Fair sunsets, ne'er beholden, Far soul-depths never stirr'd. New foot-tracks for our treading, Ne'er travell'd spirit ways, Oh, joy of the untraversed Fresh story-bringing days! LIFE AND LOVE. We were to be born, and we are to die, And a little life between; The past doth open and hazy lie, The future a chinkless screen. We were to be born, and we are to die, And a little love between; And we feel all dimly, we know not why, A light on the great Unseen. THE CLIFF. âWorlds not realised.â Fair is the sea at fullest tide, And beautiful the mountain side; But outward happiness to me Is best assur'd, when I can see The light upon the sea-bird's wing From banks where heath and harebells spring; And turn from blowing flowers to hail The glory on the flitting sail. This happy autumn-tide to me Such mingled joy of earth and sea Was richly given; for I found A slope of heaving, grassy ground, As rich in bloom as inland dell, Though at its feet the surges fell, And temper'd with the rising tide The stillness of the mountain side. A cliff rough-shod with tangled weed, Whose top was strewn with clover seed, From whose high, sea-encircled brink No meadow-nurtured flower would shrink; But where all creatures inland-born Were ocean-cherishedâYellow Corn, The lidless ox-eye, and the small Close mountain flowers that sweeten all The turfy coverts 'twixt the brake, With those dim earthy scents that make More glorious the treasure-tide From belts of purpling heather wide, And lightly balm the wind that stirs The heavy fragrance of the furze. 'Mid such sweet pasture 'twas not strange The culling butterfly should range; Brown, mottled moths were there, that bore Deep mysteries of fairy-lore On their strange-pictur'd wings, that none Howe'er keen-eyed could muse upon, So swift the runic page was turn'd, As some fresh beauty was discern'd 'Mong beckoning blossom-crowds, that prest With treasure their bewilder'd guest. With idle sport, in idlest mood, The boldest traveller I pursued, Beyond the neighbouring vetch's rim Across the crowding flower-tops dim, Past the thick fern, to where upon The mountain's utmost verge there shone A great moon-daisy, on whose wide White leaves it rested satisfied An instant, then as eager fled To the vast ocean's foaming bed. I watch'd the blossom-busied thing To that dim wilderness take wing, Each changeful solace left behind, The restful leaves, the flowery wind; And on, around it and before, A boundless life, to which it bore No sweet affiance such as lies 'Twixt springing lark and summer skies; But where each influence seem'd to press On the slight creature's nothingness: And watching, following so, a shade Fell o'er my spirit, half-afraid, Half-questioning, if she were not As ignorantly bound; her lot As perilous; and must she break From life's bright mountain side to take Her way into a world to be As desolate as that lone sea? Fair are the waves at fullest tide, And beautiful the mountain-side, But dear the ocean cliff, for there We touch the flowers, yet feel an air That nurtures other life, and know That a great world doth overblow Our soft land-breezes; and if some Sad musings to our pleasure come, We cannot neighbour the unknown, Or let our thoughts stray from their own Self-chosen boundaries, without A sense of homelessness, of doubt,â A sense swift-master'd by the strange Unconquerable need of range That gives us pilot thoughts, and wise Far reaching hope to colonise New spirit realms; oh, but for these, What joy were on the widening seas? For even in outward forms to see Athwart the solemn mystery Of those twin-breathing livesâthe Here, And the Here-hidden, bringeth cheer To the close-housÃ¨d soul, that tho' Home-keeping in her use, must grow To God's own issues, and is yet On myriad-worlded travel set.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEVOTIONAL POEMS. STEDFASTNESS. Stedfast to me, my God, Stedfast to me; O that life's paths I trod Stedfast to Thee! Changeless thy loving face, Still seeking mine; O that my eyes had grace Ne'er to shun thine! Sure Thou to do thy part, Certain thy love; O were this wavering heart Anchor'd above! Faithful thy covenant oath, Faithful to me; Broken my plighted troth, Broken to Thee. Whom thy strong arm doth hold, None pluck away, Yet we will leave its fold, Yet we will stray. Thou who to sinners came, Sinful am I, On thy all-healing Name Helpless I cry. Lo, to thy cross I come, Tears blind the way, And at thine anguish dumb Mutely I pray. Low-bowed, my shamÃ¨d head Turns now to see Eyes, whose full purpose shed Pardon on me. Lift with thy piercÃ¨d hands, Lift me e'en now; Draw me with human bands, Thou, only Thou. For, by thy heart's outpour'd Life, I must be Patient, long-suffering Lord, Faithful to Thee! THE FOURTH WATCH. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to them. St. John vi. 17. It was now dark; yet Jesus drew not nigh Unto His own: 'Gainst swelling sea, and tempest-brooding sky, They strove alone. âHe bids us perish who hath power to save!â Rose the wild cry, And still the rising wind, the angrier wave, Made fierce reply. It is now dark; Lord Jesus, shall we doubt Right on to steer, Though for a few brief furlongs left without Thy guidance clear? It is now dark, and therefore Thou art nigh; Full stedfast we Bear on, as under the controlling eye We cannot see. The darker peril brings the deeper peace, So Thou be there: Though blacker grow the night, though storms increase, We have no care. Across the wildering main no way we see; But Lord, Thou dost: It is now dark; the darkness is our plea For perfect trust. THE GIFT OF PEACE. Jesus saith unto them, Peace be unto you. And when he had so said, he showed unto them his hands and his side. âSt. John xx. 20. Lord, though no longer we would look On the dark grave by Thee forsook, Though Thou art risen indeed, Our hopes, our hearts' sad longing, yet On Calvary's holy dark is set, And still thy cross we need. Yea, on our very day of bliss, When thought of sorrow falls amiss, In joy of Easter-tide, No rest our troubled hearts can know, Except Love's sacred print thou show In piercÃ¨d hand and side. As on the heaven-lit face we gaze, In shrinking love and sore amaze, Thoughts in our hearts will rise. Our risen Lord we dare not greet, Till to His wounded hands and feet He turns our doubting eyes. But, when the mark of nail and spear Tells us the Crucified is near, Our faithless terrors cease. On us thy hands of blessing lay; Thy passion hath prepared the way For thy sweet gift of peace. THE HAPPY RESTING. Thou sleepest not:âhow safely may we sleep! Thou slumb'rest not:âhow sweet our rest should be! Fear we for our BelovÃ¨d? Thou wilt keep The watch, we do but yield them unto Thee. Nor need we yield them prayerfully, as though They were commended to a stranger's care; Having so long time known Thee, Lord, we know It is enough for them that Thou art there. THE BETRAYAL. Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spake. He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is it? âSt. John xiii. 21, 22, 25. Lord, if he who lov'd thee best, Lying lowly on thy breast, When he heard Thee sadly say, âOne among ye shall betray,â Could not quite his heart assure, 'Gainst that foulest sin secure, But with trembling sought reply,â âLord, who is it, is it I?â If the twelve Thou countedst blest, For the faith their lives confest, For the love that did not shrink Of thy bitt'rest cup to drink; If those hero-saints that stand Nearest Thee on either hand, Loyal-hearted, could not cry âLord, who is it? 'tis not I.â How shall we who have not borne For thy sake, or taunt or scorn, Dare to dream such doubt had ne'er Dimm'd our faith had we been there? Rather let us own each heart In the traitor's sin hath part; Might desert Thee, might deny; âLord, who is it, is it I?â Since we all have put to shame, Jesus, thy most sacred name, Since our lives have mocked Thee more Than the Crown of Sorrows sore, Think on us when Thou dost pray For the souls that might betray; For from broken hearts we cry, âLord, who is it? it is I.â THE FRESH SPRINGTIDE. While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not cease. âGenesis viii. 22. I cannot tell what weal or woe The coming year may bring; To me it is enough to know The birds will wake and sing; And the simple flowers of long ago About my pathway spring. I know not if my life be set To sad or blithesome cheer; Mine eyes, though they may chance be wet With many a bitter tear, Will find the April violet As fresh as yester year. The drooping windflowers, purple-dyed, Across the woods will blow; Sweet Nature will not be denied Her dainty Eden show, Nor let the saddest from her side Unblest, ungladden'd go. Oh, well for us she never may Tire of her sweet refrain! Till every tear is wiped away, Till there is no more pain, The changeful seasons' soothing sway Shall keep its constant reign. THE FIRST SPRINGTIDE. When Eden's garden was new-drest, When not a flower had blown, And Eve from veiled buds but guessed What glory would be grown, Of springtide joys the very best Meseemeth was unknown. Our fond remembrances beget Hopes that outbliss surprise: Whilst in green shielding cover yet The fragrant purple lies, My memory-bosom'd violet Its hidden sweet supplies. THE UNFAILING SPRINGTIDE. Afar, in times we cannot trace, Or know what man will be, 'Tis sweet to feel the flowers will grace His sadness and his glee; And the carol-birds a little space Will hold him sorrow-free. There will be scent of blossom-may Above my graveyard mould; The sun-warm'd little ones will play Where I am lying cold; And the pleasure that has had its day Return a thousandfold. CHILDREN OF THE PROMISE. O Lord, they have great faith in Thee, Thy hedgerow children small; They take no thought of what shall be, What terror shall befall: Their tender blooms they open free At thy creating call. While underneath a leaden sky, At thy low-whisper'd word, On leafless boughs confidingly Trills out the happy bird, The primrose opes a trustful eye By some sweet instinct stirr'd. The fragile flowers we love the best Thou giv'st when frosts are keen; 'Mid ruffling winds Thou cherishest The tender nursling green; Thy perfect strength most manifest In weakest things is seen. Dear Lord, Thou askest us to grow Sweet flowers of grace for Thee; But the chill wind doth fright us so, We fear their doom to see; We will not let the blossoms blow In a world so winterly. But if the timid flower will breast For Thee the bitter air; If the unshelter'd bird can rest On barren boughs, and dare Grow songful of the summer nest He feels Thou wilt prepare, Shall we not, Lord, that love requite That gives our faith free room? Shall it not be our high delight To sing 'neath skies of gloom? To yield to peril and to blight The flowers thou biddest bloom? And if no harvest fruit may be From our poor blossoms bred, If from the tempest-shaken tree They fall untimely dead; At Thy command, right gladly, we Their white, waste leaves will shed. THE FAR-SPENT DAY. âAbide with us . . . the day is far spent.â âSt. Luke xxiv. 29. Past are the perils of the changeful day; The glow is gone; The storm-clouds settle into evening gray, And slowly on I journey; but in pain oft looking back, Tearful I see Footprints of One, whose friendship now I lack, Grown strange to me. Why parted we? My foe in every strife Thou hast o'erthrown; Yet in this quiet afternoon of life Thou leav'st me lone. Lord, must I tarry till the graveyard rest With Thee to talk? While I still labour I can listen best: Beside me walk. As from those twain, whose hearts within them burn'd, The Saviour went, Turn'd He not round and tarried, when he learn'd The day far spent? So tarry with me till the night be past; And round me make Such glory, and such sunset, as shall last Till the daybreak. SPIRIT-LONELINESS. But one thing is needful. âSt. Luke x. 42. Only to Thee I look, I do not need That life should smile, If beauteous on thy bending face I read Content the while, Life may look ruggedly; but, Lord, I must Weep all the way, When, if thou walkest with me, still Thou dost But little say. When with thy child it seems Thou hast forgot Counsel to take; When I have cried to Thee, and Thou wilt not The silence break: When I nor faint nor fall, but onward press, Striving to be True through the dark and mist; but none the less Sicken for Thee. Wounded I was, and Thou didst make me whole; But, now I look That Thou should'st be the dayfriend of my soul, I am forsook. Thou knowest in my sickness and my pain I need Thee sore; But when I strive the mastery to gain O'er sin, still more. Be not responseless! to my prayerful call Make some reply, Lest, worn with waiting, into sin I fall To bring Thee nigh. I know Thou canst not from thy wandering sheep A long while stay; Yet leav'st me lonely, when I strive to keep The narrow way. Such yearning for Thee doth my heart possess, I have small choice How Thou should'st speak to meâto blame, or bless; I need Thy voice. Come to me, and it shall be well howe'er Thou com'st; thine own Can bear of Thee all bitterness, but ne'er Be left alone. ALL SAINTS. I pray for them . . . . for they are thine. âSt. John xvii. 9. Lord, we do not sue thy grace Only for our kindred race, But for all who seek thy face, For they are thine. Joyfully we bend the knee For thy saints, where'er they be, For all souls that cry to Thee, For they are thine. Though they count us not of kin, Since one kingdom we would win, Since we wage one war with sin, Lo, we are thine! Though they see not as we see, They have vision, Lord, of Thee, And, their works beholding, we Proclaim them thine. With one precious ransom bought, By one Heavenly Spirit sought, Safe into one haven brought, For we are thine. Though we speak with varying tongue, Since we to one Lord belong, Tuneful swells the rapture song That we are thine. And, most gracious Saviour, those Still among thy Church's foes, With thy pitying love enclose, And make them thine! OUTLOOK. âThou tellest their wanderings.â Lord, we do not only pray For our brethren far away From the land they hold so dear, Land whose memory brings the tear; But for those who further rove From a land they dearlier love, Who with saddening footsteps flee From their mother-home in Thee. So we do not pray for those Over whom the deep may close; But for those who nevermore May regain faith's restful shore. Shall thy havening Church take thought For the souls to harbour brought, With no outlook toward that sea Where perchance her shipwreck'd be? Though beyond her sight they sail, Can her prayerful watching fail? Cry that woke the Christ forgot, âLord, they perish, car'st thou not?â If their course she may not track, May not call the wanderers back; Lo, the lost to her, may be Rescued, succour'd, found by Thee. As we have thy promise plain, None have ever sought in vain; From believing hearts we say, None in vain can miss the way. GOD'S HOUSEHOLD. No more strangers and foreigners . . . of the household of God. Ephes. ii. 19. The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts. âIsaiah lvi. 8. Of home joys to the stranger One cannot lightly tell, And oh, it is so blessed At home with Christ to dwell, To those who have not known Him Scarce can his children show The peace that doth possess them, The joys that overflow! Yet not the safely-housÃ¨d, When winter snows are deep, For pity of the outcast More bitterly can weep, Than they, who in the covert Of the great Father's care, When weeping in their pity For those who are not there. Go forth unto thy wand'rers, Dear Master, draw them in; We can but beckon vainly, A word from Thee will win. And oh, Thou know'st, if only Beneath thy roof we meet, We shall not need to tell them What makes the home so sweet. LOVE'S YIELDED MEMORIES. That the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. âSt. John xvii. 26. Father, I come to thee, And these are left alone: The love with which thou lovedst me, I yield it to mine own. I know thou lovedst me Or e'er the world began; But that new human love of thine Kept for the Son of man, Kept for the cradled head, Kept for the wandering child, For lonely hours at Nazareth, For desert-temptings wild, Love only to be learnt In bitterness of loss, Learnt in the thronged Jerusalem, On the deserted Crossâ Give it to them; for they, My little ones, must bear Like me, the God-forsakenness, Like me the vanquish'd prayer. I, suppliant in their need, Through them shall never miss The tender pity of thy love In heaven's completed bliss; But in their strife shall be Fresh stricken, tempted, tried;â Love them as Thou hast lovÃ¨d me, Let us with them abide! CHRIST'S CONTINUED MINISTRY. If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. â1 Corinthians xv. 19. Dear Lord, and wilt thou nevermore thy service lone resign? The fire of coals thy hands must make by which thy children dine, And e'en within the Father's house sweet ministry is thine. Thou restest not, how canst thou rest? thine own are far from Thee: The mother's eyes must weep and watch the children on the sea; The thought of the Good Shepherd's heart with the foldless lambs must be Within thy Father's house for us Thou seekest to prepare Some earthly, homely touches, lest it show too dazzling fair For eyes, but newly-wip'd from tears, for human eyes to bear. Thou know'st our hope in Thee is not for this poor life alone, It must lead us to the vanish'd, to the long'd for, the unknown, The golden fruitage of the seed in blinding sorrow sown. We dare look on to Death's beyond unshudd'ringly for this,â That Thou wilt teach us how to bear the unfamiliar bliss When faces, glory-grown, stoop down our saintless lips to kiss. When earth's memories are about us, but on their brows instead New records of a lonely past that we have never read; And, looking up to them, we feel how long we have been dead. Lord, in that dearth and loneliness, that pain of all things new, Come to us Thou whose feet have trod our whole long journey through, Take our forgotten years, and mould our future thereunto. A NEW YEAR'S THANKSGIVING. That thy long-suffering is such Our praises we outpour; That we have liv'd, for that is much, And lov'd, for that is more. That we shall die, for that is most: Lord, for thy threefold gift, Whose choicest part Thou last bestow'st, Our praiseful hearts we lift! THE WEANING OF SAMUEL. But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he appear before the Lord, and there abide for ever. 1 Samuel i. 22. O thou my son, I prayed for thee amiss! With senseless vow Rending my heart from the o'ermast'ring bliss That binds me now. Why wilt thou trouble me? thou art not mine: I gave thee ere My right to give: thou art an holy sign, An answer'd prayer. Thou art not mine,âI may not touch thy hair, Not take the least Round curl of babyhood; my hands must ne'er Profane God's priest. To His dear use thou should'st ere this have been Return'd; but He Suffers me tarry yet awhile to wean My heart, and thee. Lo, from thy weanÃ¨d lips my unwean'd heart With anguish slow, With sudden snatches of remorse must part: They must forego Even these mother kisses,âmust forget! In temple-round My little one may minister, not yet Of God be found. He is of me: no higher worship knows Than my bow'd face. May I not keep him till he meeter grows For th' Holy Place? Think me not thankless. For my childless years Some pity spare, Thou who didst answer when my hidden tears To thee made prayer. 'Tis the sweet strangeness; 'tis my love's amaze That holds me so; 'Tis from deep wells of wonder-swelling praise These drops o'erflow. Might he but tarry with me till his touch Had lost its charm; Till to familiar pleasure the first flush Of joy could calm! He wakes. I could have given him while he slept; He needs me now. I falter; but with faltering heart have kept, Will keep my vow! I AM THE LORD, I CHANGE NOT. Change not, change not to me, my God, I would that Thou should'st be To furthest worlds what Thou hast been on this sad earth to me. Though Thou hast baffled sore my life, though thy swift scourging rod Hath left me spirit scarr'd, I cryâChange not to me, my God! Change not to me for any change that o'er my soul may come, When lips that dearly love thy praise in bitterness are dumb; Yea, when I love not at all, when from thy face I flee, Let thy compelling love pursue, my God, change not to me! When Death hath wrought his awful change, and left me spirit bare, Thou who didst hide me 'neath thy wings, thy mantling love prepare; I am no other than I was when most Thou didst befriend, I trust Thee, Lord, for what Thou wert, be changeless to the end. I do not ask with sudden step thy purest heaven to win, Be still, Most Merciful, all love-relentless to my sin; Yea, Lord, make wholly beautiful what Thou hast lov'd so well, Burn out in me whate'er defiles, burn out in fire of hell. Let me but know thy voice, its word I will in all obey, In outer darkness still most sure that Thou wilt find a way To bring thy banish'd to Thyself, as Thou didst bring of old, When thy sin-wearied child but thought on the forsaken fold. Change not to me in those far-worlds, where all is strange and new; Where can my stranger spirit rest, if thou art changÃ¨d too? As turns the child from alien crowd to the one kindred face To find that mother eyes make home in unfamiliar place, So trembling must I turn to Thee, the God whom I have known, The God who in this lonely world hath never left me lone. Do with me, Lord, whate'er Thou wilt, so only Thou wilt be For ever, and for evermore, what Thou hast been to me. THE INNER REVELATION. Hereby know we that we dwell in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit. â1 John iv. 13. For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off. . . . But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it. âDeuteronomy xxx. 11â14. How shall I free my soul from doubt? How with clear eye discern The God I cannot live without, Yet tremble to mislearn? Deep in my inmost heart I look, The Written Word I see; And I must blot the Holy Book, Or mar my thought of Thee. But though I sadly should forego All that therein is said; Far sweeter truths mine heart doth know Than e'er mine eyes have read. My God I should not therefore lose, Deep-learnÃ¨d from within, My trembling heart the heavenly news By hearsay did not win. Thou dwellest not in temple wall Of written human speech; Thou art a living Breath to all, A Love new-wrought for each. Fresh vision to fresh op'ning sight Thou ever dost unfold; The sunset dyed for us to-night No other eyes behold. Sweet commune hadst Thou with thine own In happy early days; Thy children walked by faith alone, They asked not of thy ways. True is the trust of childish eyes; But, when the child doth grow, Love's passion in diviner wise Deep-probing youth doth know. We doubt, we question, we desire; Lord, do we love Thee less? We would have brain and heart conspire Full worship to express. But while in fading record sought, Thou wilt be ever dumb: We crave the life-bloom of thy thought, Thou God who art to come! We ask to learn Thee, Lord, so well, By glad communion free, That our love-lighted souls may tell Each word false-writ of Thee. THE DIVINE DAYBREAK. From Thee the budding flowers, the breaking skies, Man's opening eyelids, and morn's golden gray; Lord, on thine eye doth no new vision rise? What Thou beholdest hast Thou seen alway? Hath all thy will been taught to us of old? Dost Thou but read to us a written book? Or to thy chosen children slow unfold A day on which thine own eyes freshly look? May not the growing light, the widening view, The sweet blue folded distances be thine? Far hopes, ideals fresh, great purpose new, In lustre break upon the thought divine? May not thy love to usward, perfect aye, Itself refashion as the ages roll; And Thou, enlarging thy heart's boundaries, lay Still closer claim to the upsoaring soul? As grows the child, doth not the mother dare Still higher futures for her darling see? So would we dream Thou dost for us prepare Grander Hereafters as we climb to Thee. Lord, hast Thou like to us the kindling heart, The broad'ning aim? Art Thou indeed so nigh, Our spirit-gleams give back in feeble part Some outburst of a glorious light on high? Doth our poor sunlight in its golden rise Thine eye's diviner daybreak dimly show? Lo, we are watchers of thy morning skies, To love Thee dearer as our light doth grow THE LEAST IN THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. The lily who can choose but greet? The cowslip-scent is ever sweet, But dearer joy to me It is in their old haunts to find Those wayside flowers of humbler kind That few would care to see. 'Tis hard to sing of them in verse, The Basil Thyme, the Shepherd's Purse, The Poor Man's Weatherglass; Yet the rough-christen'd names they bear (Untutor'd fancy's rude compare) Give pleasure as I pass. And oh, meseemeth every year More marvellous it doth appear How they their place maintain. They break not into gloried hues, When the soft heaven beseeching woos; They chalice not the rain; They have scant beauty to desire, Yet the great God doth never tire Of these poor wayside weeds. A little waft of homely scent, Breathing to Him their deep content, Is all the praise He needs. And if He wearieth not of these, If such dim-flowering things can please, The hope our spirit cheers That our poor lives, obscure and dim, May quietly bloom on to Him Through the eternal years. TROMPETENRUF. We shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump. â1 Cor. xv. 51, 52. When I awake I am still with thee. âPsalm cxxxix. 18. All awake, and fair summoned, at one trumpet-call, All startled, all deafened, the great and the small. What all? From the babe who but catches a gleam Of the finis-doom'd sunlight's funereal beam To the long-lost obliterate dead? We are men: But Godâwill He know all his creatures again? Those tribes, locust-black'ning the earth as they pass, Of whom one can only take knowledge in mass; The brain-budding beasts of the ages of Stone, Who ate and who drank, and bequeathed useful bone,â Ah, how will they neighbour? What wise will God blend The first sketches of man with his consummate end? The grand, child-soul'd warrior chief, passion'd for fame, With the minds many-sided, too cultur'd for aim? Those fable-begetting and wonderful-eyed Early races of men in the earth's golden tide, What marvels await them amid their compeers! How their dreams are outleapt by the swift-running years! The nature they timidly worshipp'd and wooed, Behold by their fellows to service subdued! Love-happy, obedient to man's master will, She smiles at her iron-brain'd conqueror's skill. And the women? Fair Eve with her serpent-sham'd grace To her far-after daughter of long homag'd race; Girlhood's prefacing charms in those slave-nymphs of old To its perfected self, woman-bosom'd, man-souled? These uttermost sever'd ones, how will they meet; When God makes the list on His bead-roll complete? Day by day, touch on touch, His creation arose; Does His fair-order'd work find harmonious close In this seizing of souls from warm bodies in breath To judge side by side with the firstfruits of death? But, confusion apart, it is odd God should keep The dead of His love in long-centuried sleep: No deep inner life-stir is granted to these; They are not as live, winter-burgeoning trees; But, stripp'd of the body, the soul is put by,â All things come in useful,âmeanwhile let it lie; When the course of the spirit-quick ages is past, The trumpet will shake it to hearing at last. So, if it all chances as wiseacres tell, At death we bid life and its Giver farewell, To go to some lumber-room He will provide, Till the house, many-mansion'd, give place at His side. How wasteful, how blank all this waiting appears! Doth God keep grim holiday myriad years? Turn'd adrift from life's schoolhouse, His scholars remain In the chill of the grave-mould and thick-driving rain! And why should we dream He will care to renew Old friendships long-broken, long kept out of view, On the grand day of meet? Oh, too bitter for scorn Is the yoke man hath made of His Maker and borne! To think of this earth, full of mothers, and those The grand mother-hearted to all human woes, What a glorious ideal is fashioning there, 'Mid the meanness and sinning that make men despair! There the father toils long for the children slow-taught, There the sick are meek-tended, the dead kept in thought, And each weak helpless thing hath its shield-scale of love, Callow fledgling to warm-feathered wing; while above, God to us?âNay, these things are the rough outer guise Of a deep-lying love that is hid from our eyes: The mother hath master'd, the death-watcher known, In part, the great yearning God hath for His own,â His own by the birthclaim. Who giveth the breath Must give the life-blessing. Who giveth the death Must give its befitting completion, not lay His half-finish'd beauteous creature away. The night-falling shadows foretell the daybreak; Who hush'd to the slumber will soon kiss awake.â His herald a trumpet-blast startling and grim? Not to war, to deep peace we are going, to Him Who His earth-sleeping children so tenderly stirr'd With the touch of the sunbeam, the voice of the bird. Ah, would He but deal with us as He hath done, But be to us what He hath been, we should shun No longer the death-beck'ning hand; but 'tis said He will change from that past when we chance to be dead; And in the world-summoning Judge, terror-crown'd, The likeness to Providence scarcely be found. If Death did not change Him, what could make us afraid To come face to face with the God we had pray'd? Did the veil of the flesh so safe hide us? lo, He To the heart's inmost places could utterly see, Yet to Him in our troubles and sinfalls we came, And knew we should find Him for ever the same; Still stedfast our oft-wavering spirits to win, Resistlessly earnest to root out our sin; And ruthless in leaving the sting-thrust, or thorn, By the pain-shrinking flesh to be patiently borne. A grief-unremitting, prayer-vanquishing Friend, Who would bid us endure in our tears to the end, Fresh strength His sole succour; but tenderly still Would suffer beside us, and win to His will. And nowâWho hath lov'd us, Who called us His own, We shall see 'mid the chill heaven-breadths on a throne! O to wake from the presence-room terror, and find Thee, the piteous God of the life left behind: The God of our childhood, Who wooed us, or e'er For the mute lips that marvelled the mother made prayer, Till we caught up the meaning of love, and grew bold All our even then shroud-loving souls to unfold: The God of our heartgriefs, to Whom we have brought All peril of passion, all anguish of thought;â The fast-growing love that thick-shadow'd must stay (A glance from the world's Pharaoh-hearted would slay), Though it starve in the shade of its sheltering reeds; And Thou hast provided! or those deeper needs, That still sorer trouble, the guilt-growing dread Lest thy love be not all thy too-trusting have said: Soon as found, each hard thought, treason-tinctur'd, of Thee We have given Thee back, loyal-hearted, to see, And Thou hast been gracious, unanger'd by doubt Of a love we so sorely should sicken without, And question through too much desiring. Lord, why Should the friendship be broke when Thou biddest us die? For Thee we have borne many deaths, and can bear; Scourge, chasten, afflict us, but have us in care! We ask not a âfainÃ©antâ heaven to gain; Young-limbed in endeavour, unshrinking from pain, We look for fresh life-fields, fresh labours to share With the dear earth-loved comrades, new-harvesting there. O to work with our dearest once more by our side! Can we spare it to leisure, that rich morning-tide Of the day-bloom eternal? Nay, rather one kiss, One deep folding of love, and we fall to the bliss Of living, and loving, and serving, and feel Through the broad-nation'd band the sweet unity steal That centred our tiny home-circle, and joy In our fresh-furnished youth, and its higher employ. Short rest will suffice us. How sadly our cries To Thee, the much-work-setting Master, must rise! Lord, take the tools back, ere we learn the least part, Unto patternless truth, of life's consummate art! Each beginning is hard, this too irksome, and so All the full artist-triumph and calm we forego, And ask for inertness! More nobly for aim Deep-rooted in purpose (the child found to blame In the fret of his feverish haste), and for power To work through slow years toward the perfected hour. What, sicken for soul-ease? We seek to go higher, Fulfilment to win for a larger desire. New heavens, new earth, Thou wilt ope to our view, Thou Thyself to our short-travelled eyes wilt be new! We press earnest-hearted and eager to Thee, Still eastward-eyed gazing toward what Thou wilt be, And know it will differ as youth from old age; Is the story the same when we turn o'er the page? What futures await us? World-clusters in store For thy star-seeking children Thou hoardest; all lore Thou countest a pound-gaining servant, dost lay With unsparing hand treasure-trove in the way Of those who believe for the works' sake: we well Can conceive how thy universe-students will dwell (No light to their questioning vision denied), Thee, its myst'ry-unravelling Master beside. What daybreak of bliss on their faces! Not less Thy faith-hardy, desert-soul-venturers bless, Who have learnt Thee the heart fashion, friend unto friend; Can life master such theme from beginning to end? Or shall we not be thy most backward of all, We, who spell out thy love, though the letters be small, And Thou writest in characters painfully fine: The big text on the wall was more clearly divine; But we are beyond those first copies, and now Do not learn by large letters, but study the how Of the full-grown, and soul-guided hand, till our wit Can learn what it hath, what men say it hath writ. And shall we not have our reward? What, not find New fields for deep search in the infinite mind? Give rest to thy weary and pain-stricken; we Of the soul's âWanderlustâ ask far travel of Thee. We ask Thee to be to us New World and Old; The story to tell, and the story long told. Nor need we that any should come to us, spies From the outlying life that is hid from our eyes. All hearsay were false; of such infinite news The earth-dwindled, spirit-clipt from would confuse. Toward Thee in the darkness undaunted we turn, Soul to soul, one by one, its great wonder to learn. Supreme in the goal-touch, Columbus in tread, Each footprint fresh claims the new world of the dead. No chart for Death's thick-travers'd ocean is found, Bound for Thee, yet unknowing for what we are bound, All blank in horizon, unpiloted, lone, We seek a far country to spirit-dreams shown, And the peril and trust-need ennoble: we take Each night a like faith-asking voyage, and wake, The sunbeams about us, till, trusting Thee quite, Our eyes close in flush of the soft morning light. So, when the Great Dark'ning draws on, let it be, So, Lord, let us sleep, let us waken in Thee! But lest on our heaven-weak vision at first The sun-blooming air should too dazzlingly burst, And the pure light perplex us, O turn to us then The face Thou hast turn'd to the children of men! Let thy dear earth-remembering pity recall The joy and the pain Thou hast been to us,âall Of the life that is lying between us, and lo, With Thee to what future Thou wilt we can go.</field>
