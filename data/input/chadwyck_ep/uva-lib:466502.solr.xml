      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MARCHIONESS OF LONDONDERRY, This little Volume IS MOST AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE UNLOVED OF EARTH. Where shall the unloved of earth abide, 'Midst all its pomp, and power, and pride? Where find one hope to soothe or bless A heart divorced from happiness? Where pity or protection seek, O'erborne by life's storms, wild and bleakâ To all its changeful skies exposed, Its blessings all against them closed? What emblem sad enough may be, For shadowing forth their destiny? Hath Nature, through her regions old, Aught that may their dark fates unfold? A flower with its heart-leaf unveiled, By every frost and blight assailedâ A bird forsaken in the nest, When all its tribes are gay and blestâ A broken shell from ocean torn, Its music hush'd, its splendours shornâ A lone star from its orbit drivenâ An exile from its native heaven! O! ye unloved ones of the earth! A bitter boon hath been your birth; That bitter boon ye must receive, Without redressâwithout reprieve. A thousand wormwood-springs are straying, Where your lone course ye are delaying; A thousand nightshade-bowers entwining, Where ye, th' o'erwearied, are reclining. And spells of deadliest power are cast, O'er all your future, present, past; And many a strange bewildering haze Misleads ye in life's lengthening maze. For youâfor you, the blue pale air Hath haunting whispers of despair; A sorrowing murmur thrills the breeze, A shadow broods 'mongst flowering trees; In music's heavenliest tone, a sigh Troubles the deep mid-harmony; Ye hear the breathings of farewell, Soon as the summer lights the dell! For you even Spring hath weeping glooms, Or smiles as cold as lamps in tombs; And Morning, with her plumaged throngs, Hath under-tones in her blithe songs: Vain is her bright and blushing bloom Your jaundiced fancy to illume With one warm rosy ray of gladnessâ No!âunpartakenâall is sadness! Ay! your upspringings in the hour Which glorifies the lowliest flower, But make you feel, beneath the sun, Ye're cherished and beloved by none! No precious household-words shall greet The approach of your familiar feetâ No smiles (the keys of heaven for you) Shall speak of loveâthe fond and true. Those desolate strangers of the earth! Harsh to their ears sounds joy and mirth; A veil for them shrouds land and sky In doubt, in fear, in mystery. When round them lower the clouds of care, Still blackeningâblackening to despair, None shall, with might of kindred feeling, From life's long troubled waves draw healing. Sad where they restâsad where they roam, A desert is their worldâtheir home. Their hearth-stones see no smiling rites, Their roof-tree echoes no delights; Where'er they dwell, where'er they move, They shed a gloom o'er life and love: And O! to them who hopeless look, Blank is the page of Nature's book. For them the past's deep starry lore Hath shafts that smite their bosom's core; By love still girtâwith love still blentâ Of love's bright wealth munificent! Earth's mysteries and diversities, For them are linked by fearful ties; One vein of wo through all is led, Their heart-strings twined it while they bled. The pagod-idols they have made, And in their spirits' light arrayed, Crushed all to clay, lie mouldering soon, In fragments round their footsteps strewn. O'er their slow lingering march of years, No hope its blazoned standard rears; No pillars of love's heavenly fire Their journeyings prompt, their strength inspire. Still, with the lapwing's mystic art, They find those fountains of the heart That never unto them shall flow, Orâdark as Dead-Sea waves of woe! And like the leaf of hellebore, Their lone affections darkling o'er, Into themselves must turn again, All poisoned with the dews of pain; Like some celestial heliotrope, Condemn'd 'mongst spreading shades to droop! Where suns of beauty never shine, Or only in their pale decline! Lost stricken deer! their quenchless thirst By many a neighbouring fountain's burst Is fired!âthey lie midst thousand streams, But none shall bathe their burning dreams. Not like that prince of old renowned, By genii gifts enriched and crowned, Lord of a sovereign amulet! Are their hearts' wishes coldly set To gain a vain and empty boast Of senseless show and boundless cost! No! 'tis not for the Roc they pine, Midst all the spoils of wave and mine! Ah, no! the treasure they have sought, The Mecca of each pilgrim-thought, In the soul's fervid depths enshrined, Gilds all with alchemy refined. Ay! 'tis the pure immortal gem, The diamond of the diademâ The source, the spring, of every joyâ The elixir that can never cloyâ The sovereign star of all the skiesâ The cynosure of countless eyesâ The master-chord of every lyreâ The kindling spark of Heaven's own fire. But ne'er may they its joys rehearse; To them 'tis but a treacherous curse. For all their tears, for all their prayers, Its shadows and its sighs are theirs. The worm that never more shall die, The seal-mark of fierce agony, The canker and the broken reed,â Their portion in the hour of need! The staff, the mantle, light, and crown, From their faint grasp are stricken down; Their soul's transpierced with quickening ray But to behold them rapt away! They in their sorrowing silence tread O'er a volcanic island's bed; It yields them not one guiding ray, Still smouldering 'neath their steps away! The golden bowl for them lies broken, Ere Death has sent one startling token,â All mute and dark the silvery string Ere one wave of his ghastly wing. Their hearts are shrines whose oracles Are flown, till, like faint echo-cells, They thrill to every passing tone, That should respond to one alone; Or like rich vases that have graced Some temple-fane now fallen, defacedâ Their sculpture-wreaths, their emblems shattered, Their incense to the cold winds scattered. If Nature's gifts vouchsafed have been To those sad wanderers of life's sceneâ Those gifts, like scorpions, flame-surrounded, Are by themselves undone and wounded; A seer's eye may to them be given, But do they visions smile like heaven? By Heaven at least they're girt and boundâ No rest for them on earth is found. No rest for them in life may be, Like Delos floating on the sea Of old, still wandering on and on, Till from each cloud in heaven is won Its dark'ning showerâfrom every rock A shadowy gloomâa quivering shock From each wild waveâa withering blight From each wind on its arrowy flight. No shield is theirs throughout the strife, The long, long battle-storm of life: No clue throughout its labyrinths twining, No vane midst its wild changes shining. The dew's wrung from the heavy dawn, The torchlight from the race withdrawn!â That mighty race whose ranks are strengthened By all whose life-ordeal is lengthened! But O! when 'tis on woman's head Black Disappointment's storms are shed, Its fiery rain of living coals Showered through her passionate soul of souls,â She, fused in Feeling's tenderest mould, Girt round with Love's own cestus-fold, Well may the shuddering fancy shrink, Lothâloth on such wild woes to think. Like the olden patriarch's ladder, seems To them, in all their wo-worn dreams, Love's bright ascents still heavenwards leading, Whilst their hearts at the base lie bleeding! Their ark of blessings all despoiled, The serpents 'mongst its ruins coiled, Their futureâone vast tempest-cloud, With threatening night and thunders bowed! Vials of wrath for them are pouredâ Quivers with deadliest fates are storedâ Crucibles hoard for them their fires, However pure their heart's desires! Theirs seems each attribute of grief,â The cypress bough, the willow leaf, The upas-shades are trembling o'er themâ The wild, the rock, the grave's before them! Their birthrights cancelled or deniedâ Their nature forced in backward tideâ Their prospects foiled, their aims o'erthrown, Their friendships wronged, their hopes cast down! Their bark of life without one breeze Midst its immeasurable seasâ No anchor, compass, chart, or star, To fix, guide, cheer it from afar! Each moonlight beam of memory, Breaking through long despondency, But shews these ravages, these ruins, The wrecks, the spoils, the wild undoings. They pray, but with a faltering lipâ E'en prayer would claim companionship; When vesper-strains are murmuring sweet, 'Tis sweeter answering strains to meet. Their laughter's hollow, broken, low, More sad than breakings-forth of wo; Their tears fall, scorching up their souls, Each drop like blistering lava rolls! Sighs are their painful eloquence, Or silence breathless and intenseâ The sun of sorrow's desolate breast Hath sunk in an eternal west! Each dawning hope that haunts their hearts But dwells one moment and departs, To leave pale marks, like fairy ringsâ Or moultings of some lost dove's wingsâ Or foam-wreaths, lingering on the shore When th' ebbing waves shine there no moreâ Or ship-wreck fragments on those waves, Betraying but the site of graves! Their meek affections have been sent On pilgrimage of banishment. Not like proud Psaphon's missioned birdsâ They speak no fame-awakening words! But, scattered on their journeyings wide, Have drooped, have languished, and have died; Till in their lone ark they are leftâ Who sent them forth â of all bereft! One dream of love might breathe away The cloudy mantle from their day, Shed glories o'er earth's fragile dust Wherein we place our trembling trust. Our trust! O, ye Unloved! 'tis well For ye who midst its deserts dwell, Where the false lures of life shall ne'er Bewilder ye with visions fair! Earth's loftiest trusts are faint and frail, Earth's mightiest expectations fail, And death and love at last must meet, And hope is false, and time is fleet; And still, and ever, day by day, Life's rich enchantments drop away, Like jewels loosened from a chain, Like sparkles from the fire-fly's train. O, ye Unloved! 'tis well for ye Desolate in this life to be, To weep when shines morn's flushing ray, To sigh when thrills the sky-lark's lay, To shrink from pleasure's specious wiles, To tremble at joy's thoughtless smiles; Still, still the noblest powers are there, To feel, to combat, and to bear! The currents of the heart still flow, The sun-lights of the soul still glow; But ice on these all coldly weighs, Round those have fallen a shadowing haze; Yet both shall deathless burn, and stream With victory in each wave and beamâ The imprisoned rays shall turn to gems Meet for celestial diadems! Ay! even their cold imprisoned tears Shall outshine the refulgent spheres! And their heart's founts, all fettered now, Shall gush when seas forget to flow! Though checked awhile, yet all undried, By noons unscorched, by storms untried, Till with heaven's glassy waves of light Mixed unimaginably bright! Then courage! courage! shrink ye not, Though steep your road and drear your lot; Yours be the high and glorious part, To make a temple of the heart; Each wish to impale, each thought to affix On Resignation's crucifix! To consecrate to Heaven the soulâ To Heaven to yield the unbroken whole. O! may the Dove of Peace descendingâ In stainless purities transcendingâ Shed healings through each wounded spirit, Destined the promised palms to inherit! From the dark love of earth preserved, For holier things designedâreserved, Be theirs the immortal task to prove, How just, how true, the Immortal Love! Be their affections lone and high, Lightning-conductors to the sky! So some unsheltered towering spire Draws on itself the electric fire, While gleam the precious shrines beneath, Unconscious of the bolts of death: Even the low tombs whence fate is warded, By cherubim's own swords seem guarded. Thus, in their spirit's inmost centre, Where death and ruin may not enter, The heavenward adorations treasured, Shall spring to strength and height unmeasured; Now winning from the unsheathed lightnings Only the splendours and the brighteningsâ Then bathed in their own source and sun, With nought to fear and nought to shun. And O! from some keen throes they're sparedâ Those, that no kindred thoughts have shared! They linger notâamazedâaghast, When love with all its smiles hath past; Nor to the heedless gale they cry, Breathless with frenzying agony, To give one chainless echo back, From the Departed's mournful track. Nor feel they that worst loneliness, Which absence doth inform, impress, With dim forebodings and distrust, With sounds of air and shapes of dust; And death but strikes one single blowâ No smothered moans of speechless wo Shall thrill the deep gloom mournfully, Redoubling life's last agony! Turn from earth's tearful hopes, then, turn! And in eternity's deep urn Hoard the soul's mighty waters all, Far from the storm, the waste, the thrall. Though in chill dungeons of the breast Now all your feelings lie suppressed, They shall yet have their guerdoning hour, And reap immortal joy and power. So the pale diver of the main Drags his sad life of wo and pain: In darkness are his treasures heapedâ From darkness are his harvests reaped! He moves through depths of boundless gloom, Far from the day-spring's dewy bloom, To find those gems not elsewhere found, Wherewith earth's haughtiest kings are crowned. Yet not so ye! though ye too tread Through realms of darkness and the dead, Gathering the treasures that are piled Far 'neath the billowy surges wildâ The wealth in jewel-heaps amassed, Priceless bequeathments of the pastâ But ye snatch not that kingly crown For others' browsâbut for your own! THE MOURNERS. Mourn! mourn with that mother, her life's crown lies shivered, Her spirit is broken by anguish and love; She weeps for her child, to the cold grave delivered, And comfort is none for earth's heart-wounded dove. One thought strikes her heart, with its lightning-like burningsâ One phantom of memory clouds her sick brain; While wrapt in the silence of heart-aches and yearnings, She hoards up with passion's strange avariceâher pain! The dear one whose voice through the blest household bowers, Still summoned her soul to sweet, serious delight, Lies perished and pale, like the youngest of flowers, When earthwards 'tis borne by some withering blight. How bright through the long days of summer she moved, The fawn's gladsome boundings were tame to her step! Song burst from her heartâshe was loving and lovedâ Laughter's brilliant melody rang from her lip. Those tones have now melted from bower and from breeze, But the mother's heart still with their echoes is thrilling; Affection's rich cup hath dark gall in its lees! Fierce agonies 'stead of enchantments distilling! Mourn! mourn with that sister! grief weighs down her brow; She dwells but in thoughts of the silentâthe sleeping: A rose o'er a broken rose, twins of one bough, The dews of its freshness all voicelessly weeping. In bitterest sorrow she tracks the green shades; In long willowy lifelessness droops her fair hair; The fond hands wont to wreathe and to smooth the bright braids, May never more tenderly make them their care. But mourn not for herâshe is risen, she is fled; Like a vision of beauty to us she was given. Now melt earth's dim clouds from that queenlike young head, O ! mourn not a crowned spirit's transit to heaven! LINES ON A CHAINED EAGLE. Of cloudland and the whirlwind heir and lord, How vainly round thee storm and midnight roared, In thy high haughty life of power and pride, Soaring o'er heaven-kissed mountains, ocean wide, And all the glories, all the glooms of earth! But nowâforgetful of thy skiey birth, Not now dost thou imperially aspire! Tamed is thy glance of fury and of fire! What weight chains mournfully thy realmless wings, Once! once! the mightiest of earth's freeborn things? And hast thou abdicated space and air, Thy proud domain? âNo! with a blank despair Captivity o'ercame thee! Thou! O, thou! Whom Nature's terrors might not teach to bow, Whose neck a thousand thunders clothed and armed, Round whom the tempests played, like serpents charmed! Thy throne was of the cloudsâthy track the immenseâ Thy joy thy dread, unshared pre-eminence! How, in thy stormy strength and dazzling speedâ While the tall pine bowed like a broken reedâ Thou dashedst scornfully and swift along, As to some loftier sphere thou didst belong! Rejoicing in thy vast unfetter'd force, Wild as the mountain-torrents in their course, While thunders round thee boomed! and thou didst shake, Till like a living comet's glared thy wakeâ Redoubled lightnings from thy flashing plumes Glittering athwart the tempest's quivering glooms! How did the upper worlds and wastes of sky Roll back the long peal of thy triumph-cry, Shrill as a battle-trumpet's wakening breath, Startling those elder worlds that know not death! Now doth that cry, despairingly prolonged, Scarce seem to haughty joy to have belonged; No more, while shaping thy cloud-cleaving flight, The burst is heard of thy sublime delight. Thou'st left for ever thy wild realms of old, Those kingdoms paved with purple and with gold, Those long-resounding regions of the storms, And sinkest, earth-chained, prone as earth's dull worms! Better hadst thou, by all heaven's lightning flashes Struck down at once, fallen to that earth in ashes! TO THE DEPARTED. And must it be? Alas! 'tis pastâ'tis done! Of thee this blossomy earth keeps now no trace; Thou slumberest unawakened by the sun, Though shining full on this thy silent place. Thou reckless Spring, soother of light annoy, Say, wherefore perpetrate so wildly here Thy rosy saturnalias of bright joy? This anguish-haunted spot thou canst not cheer. Thou canst not clear away with sheen and bloom The lengthened shadows from the neighb'ring air! The very flowers thou shed'st along this tomb A melancholy beauty win and wear! The haunting murmurs that meet every breeze Thy voice of triumph may not overpower, Brooding o'er every leaf of these old trees, E'en in the glory of their vernal hour. O, hither come! ye weary ones and wornâ Ye pilgrims of a waste without a palm, Who, bowed and stricken, fevered and o'erborne, Faint on life's breezy seas for one hour's calm. O, hither come! ye, sickening at life's dinâ A stilly hush here sanctifies the sceneâ A deepening mist folds all around, within Its breathless coil, its breezeless calm serene! There's music in the wind that sweeps this grave, There's music in the blue rill, wand'ring near, There's music in the turf's low whispery waveâ But broken music, full of death and fear! A viewless presenceâvoiceless consciousness! Hath girt this spot with influences sublime; Such influences as purify and bless, And breathe of things beyond the grasp of Time. Ah! Spring, the beautiful, more beauteous seems, Though shorn and softened are her mightiest rays, Seen by the solemn light, that from our dreams Extracted, round her wand'ring footsteps plays! O! joy-awakening season to the throng Whose hearts with hope's delicious trouble heave! An understrain doth pierce thy rapturous song, Breathing of peace to spirits marked to grieve. The rainbow-coloured denizens of air, From their swift wings, around briefbrilliance shed; Yet a rich sadness o'er this scene so fair, A mantle of o'ershadowing dreams hath spread. Around, a deep religious hallowing tone A reverential stillness doth impress! Reminding of a something lost and flown, Till every thought is touched with holiness. O, that I might behold once more that face, With exquisite expressions shadowed o'er, Whose lineaments even time shall ne'er erase From that full tabletâmy heart's bleeding core! O, that I might thy visioned form behold, Throned on a thousand burning clouds above, More glorious than those godlike dreams of old That through the sculptor's marble smiled in love! Yet, how might I the uncurtained mystery bearâ Who still with shadowy hopes and fears have strivenâ Too deeply beautifulâtoo pureâtoo fair, And girt with dazzling atmospheres of heaven! Yet e'en these faint and clouded fantasies, These dreamings of a dream, bring strange delight; Strengthening my soul to gaze on those rich skies, Which else had shone too joyous and too bright! No more I'll braid the dim funereal wreath, Nor cypress foliage into death-crowns twine; What hath a thought of thee to do with death? Thou turn'st the grave into a haunt divine. No! roses here shall bend their glorious brows, And shower their dewy splendours o'er thy urn; And those pale flowers that crown the unsunned snows Shall strew it when drear winter lowereth stern. E'en strangely lovely here, 'neath noontide's ray, Shall every flower appear, and every leaf, When with unshrinking heart I muse and pray, Mingling the richest hopes with fitful grief: Mingling a rapture with the unbidden sigh, A thoughtful rapture, pure and calm as sleep, Till my own soul seems soaring to the sky, Lost in those mighty hopes, the full and deep: Hopes of thy precious happiness fulfilled! For, O! oft ached thy gentle heart below; Yet was that heart, by selfishness unchilled, True to the magnet of another's wo! O, how thy lip could pour mellifluous sounds, Making the heart with sudden thrills rejoice! But every joy on earth hath envious boundsâ Silenced eternally is that soft voice. This morn I lingered by the wandering riverâ A strange weight on my faltering spirits hung; Deep mournful thoughts of her, the lost for ever! Around my path with saddening influence clung. A bright flower floated down the exulting stream, And gleamed in beauty on the dancing wave, Winning fresh radiance from each ruddy beamâ How soon to perish in that shining grave! A steep cascade was brightly foaming near, And dashed to instant death the rainbowed flower: Alas! like thee! thou parted one and dear, Its brilliant life seemed measured by an hour. So down the tide of time thy life was carried, So rich thy bloom upon the world's wild wave, So down the steep of death thy course was hurried, So wert thou swallowed in thy sudden grave. The innocent blush that mocked that sun-stained rose Passed, meteor-like!âthe eye's pure diamond-blaze, Beneath Annihilation's fiat, frozeâ No more to drink nor to dispense heaven's rays. O, Memory! shun the long and dark eclipse That bowed our souls beneath a weight of night, When the last breath passed fluttering from those lipsâ When trembled from those eyes the last pale light! NIGHT AND MORNING. I wandered through the wood, And I wandered by the wave; I bent me o'er the flood, Where angry waters rave. The night was gathering dark, And the air was gathering damp; There gleamed no glow-worm's spark, No fire-fly's fluttering lamp. Fondly I sought to dream, But mine eyelids would not closeâ Grated the night-owl's scream, Roared the pine's crashing brows. No nightingale was singing, Those solemn glooms to cheer; But the hollow winds were ringing Their death-dirge in mine ear. No lovely star was shining Through those midnight heavens of dread; No bowery foliage twining Rich umbrage o'er my head. No sweet night-blowing flowers, With their mist of incense-steam, No golden-fruited bowers Stained by the noontide beam. No verdure fresh and fairâ Carpet for fairies' feet; Spring's glories reigned not there, Nor Summer's breathings sweet. Solemn the night, and dreary,â A weight on eye and ear; The very heart felt weary, And o'ertaken by dim fear. Haunted by things long lost, Pale, shadowy memories, The undistinguishable host Of aÃ«ry phantasies. I strove to see the landâ I strove to see the sky; But Darkness waved his wand, Night wasâImmensity! But Slumber then descended, Soft visions soothed my sight, And when that brief sleep ended, The universe wasâLight! O! my bounding heart was borne On the wings of strong delight, When thy approach, sweet morn! Stilled the resounding night. Thus shines the splendid morrow, When the heavy night is past, And thus from holy sorrow Spring heaven's own smiles at last! Lovelier even light may be From darkness burning forthâ O, Suffering! 'tis from thee We learn Hope's costliest worth! LINES ON ? Deserted home! 'mongst thy old haunts I stood, While o'er my heart swept a dim dreary flood Of thick awakening memoriesâalas! Nought now isânought may more be as it was. Sad traceries tremble over every leaf That clusters round these walls! Oh, pain and grief!â To soothe whose pangs the wildest tears are vain, And but call forth redoubled grief and pain In an unanswered heart like mineâoppressed With aching lonelinessâand once how blessed! Once!ârichest, saddest word that e'er was spoken, By earth's lone fervid hearts, crushed, yet unbroken, Still clinging to some reed, or weedâsome scheme Which yet hath to depart like every dream! And this must be Take courage, stricken heart! The last of thy expectancies shall part, And Death or Hopelessness shall bring repose, And long, full respite from consuming woes. My old, old home! deserted now and drear!â Thy tapestried chambers still areâO, how dear! Still in thy walls doth each attesting stone Seem like a silent seal on hours long gone; The breath of change with the rich breath of spring Commingling mournfully, doth brood and cling To every path and flower around, while sigh, Breeze-like through all, the powers of memory: A murmur of lament doth even belong Unto the free bird's wild and gushing songâ A saddening presence of the past around, Converts the place to Sorrow's sacred ground. O, home! 'twas here I wandered free from care, Here that I breathed pure childhood's tearless prayer, Here where I lavished all that Childhood's love And Hope's fair web untremulously wove: Precious as dews to scorched and heat-bowed flowers, Fall still the memories of those vernal hours. 'Twas here, with Nature, Heaven, and mine own soul, I communed yet unconsciously, and stole Joy, power, emotion, from all earthly things: Unbubbling, unembittered, then the springs Of hope and feeling freshened through my being. Now, hope is flown and life itself is fleeing, And I fain turn me, faint and weary-hearted, To those bright hopes dispersed, and joys departed! O! how my fearless spirit, keen and wild,â For mighty is the spirit of a child!â Shot through the heights and depths, the lights and shades, Of wide imagination. Now it fadesâ That power celestial that transmuted all Earth's dust to gold, or turns its dews to gall! O that I could be even as I was then! Now, by such chains as ne'er are loosed again, Held, darkly bound, and bruised!âand all o'erborne, E'en by the things I long was wont to scornâ Chains linked by changes, by blind chances locked; Opinion, circumstance, on Time's waves rocked. Well! well! it must be, and shall be sustained! Oh, heart! how passionately art thou painedâ Crushed 'neath the weight of fallen and cumbering hopes,â Rich sheaves unbound unto the winds! till droops The smitten mind within me! Yet be mine, One path, one star, one rockâSupreme! Divine! E'en Faith!âsure anchor, guide, and torch, and shieldâ And my Heaven-strengthened spirit shall not yield; This dying heart shall soar above its doom, Though following all its hopes unto the tomb! Thus in thy bowery precincts, ancient home, Lost in the maze of an o'ershadowing gloom, As 'neath the accustomed tulip-tree I stood, Sad thoughts swept o'er me in a dreamy flood. THOUGHTLESSLY SAD. There was a timeâtoo long ago, When I shrank away from the touch of wo, When filled with joy was my tearless eye, And my lip poured its artless melodyâ A gush of laughter and gladsome sounds, As I strayed'mongst the flowering garden grounds; Fearlessly did I stray, Thoughtlessly, thoughtlessly gay. Thoughtlessly gay, as I sadly deemed In after-seasons, when pondering dreamed Mine altered spirit of all the past, To shadow and silence for ever castâ Till I turned away my sorrowing eye From the wizard glass of memory, No more, alas! to laugh and play, Thoughtlessly, thoughtlessly gay! But a gleam of hope returned again, And lightened through all my heart and brain; And I cherished that young bloom of delight, Till it shone all freshly fair and bright; Then I felt I had far too wildly mourned, And my wayward glance desponding turned From blessings life still had, Thoughtlessly, thoughtlessly sad! And there came a deeper after-thought, That through my spirit intensely wrought: Lo! the wild birds pass the stormiest wavesâ There's a hand that guides and a hand that saves; And shall I, reckless and hopeless, dare To yield my spirit to burdening care? No! no! I may not be so mad, Thoughtlessly, oh, too thoughtlessly sad! GREECE. Thy heavens are now thy crown, Bright awful land; Still, though defaced, borne down, Lovely and grand. Fountain and haunted shrine Yet make thee fair; Thy purple air divine Still, still is there. Citron flowers, pure and sweet, Load thy soft breeze; Overhead myrtles meet, And fruit-hung trees. But slowly, humbly tread! Mouldering beneath, Rest the majestic dead! Greece mourned their death. Leaders of host and fleet, Lords of wide earth, Who held on thrones their seatâ Greece hailed their birth! Here rests the kingly bard, With his crushed lyre, Whose brows enwreathed and starred, Once bore Heaven's fire. Still live the Gods of Song, The inspired! renowned!â That pale, immortal throng O'erpass death's bound. The sceptered leader's tomb A glory wears, Brightening eve's gorgeous gloom, But not like their's! Their's sheds a spirit round, Dove-like, to brood O'er depths of shade and soundâ Flowered depths of wood! They in full might passed on, Through wrath, through wrong, Till every palm was won,â Death! Death! thou'rt strong! Strong! since thou'st quenched and crushed Those spirits sublime, That ever onward rushed Through space and time. Still-still their boundless sway Is felt and owned; For Death's o'erwhelming day Fame hath atoned. But thou! bright awful land, Art thou not free? Can Slavery's Gordian band Crush thine and thee? Can thy sons bend and cower, Clasping the chain? Have ye no voice of power, Fountain and fane? Hast thou no languageâthou! Blue billowy main, That flashed round Freedom's prow In Victory's train? Have ye, O mountains old! No heaven-lent thunder, To burst each fetter-fold, Each bond, asunder? And thouâpale glorious dust! Thou'st called in vain: Still the sword keeps its rustâ The slave, his chain! ABSENCE. The shadowed hours have lingered long Since we together communed last; Thy smileâthy graceful stepâthy song, Are phantasms of the pastâ No! of the future magnet-spells, Which draw my earnest eyeâ Which on unbroken darkness dwells, If thy form floats not by. Let me transplant those night-flowers pale, Passion, and Fear, and Memory, To realms which Hope's enchanted gale Brightens with colourings of the sky. Yet if we're doomed to meet no more, And Hopeâlike something realâmust fade, O, bear to life's extremest shore One dream of meâfresh, undecayed! I know thou wilt not all forget One who forgot all else but thee; Yet think but of the hours we met In happiness and joyauncy. Noâthou'lt rehearse with fond regret All times we've passed together! Nor wilt thou, like the skies, forget Thy heart's first summer weather. Nor like the waves, whose breezy dance Doth th' onsped bark's pale track efface; Noâfixed, to scorn all change and chance, Shall be true love's untroubled trace. Yet if new suns should bless thy sphereâ New summers laugh around thee, My woman's heart could wish to tear The chain which bruised and bound thee. THE LARK AND THE BUTTERFLY. Summer, the glorious summer, shone O'er bank, and rill, and bower; The Lark, up in the heavens alone, Shed music like a shower!â A shower of fiery rapture deep, That quivered down to earthâ As waters from some shaggy steep, In silvery sheen and mirth. Beneath, where splendid-coloured flowers A thousandâthousand rainbows wove, A Butterfly lit up the bowers, Blest as that lark above! And thus my fancy prompted me, The Lark rejoicing sungâ âO Butterfly! ascend with me While summer yet is young. âThe flowers you fondly now pursue, Their blazing tints shall loseâ The heavens, when even no longer blue, Shall keep their sun-light glows. âFair Butterfly, those glorious leaves Shall sere and scattered lieâ The storm that shakes the autumn sheaves Shall powerless shake the sky!â And thus that Butterfly beneath Made answer soft and lowâ âThese flowers, 'tis true, shall sink in death, But I tooâI must go! âWith themâwhen on the stalk they droop, Transpierced with death-like dyesâ Let me melt soft from life and hope, And all their melodies! âBut thou! when death shall smite thy frame, When silenced is thy layâ No sympathy thy fate shall claim Through those blue depths of day! âThose haughty heavens will still laugh on, In glory, joy, and might; And though thy glad career be done, No gloom shall wrap the light. âFor meâa rich grave shall be mine In yon wood-hyacinth's bell,â Which shall with dewy tear-drops shine At my lastâfare thee well!â THE FAREWELL. Farewellâthe spring, with all spring-flowers, will come, To bless and cheer thee in thy woodland home, With all her gladdening spells and wildering tonesâ Her vernal treasures, stained like precious stonesâ Her wandering scents â her rainbow-splendours brightâ Her dancing waves, like floods of silvery lightâ Her flower-awakening smilesâher hurrying birdsâ And golden airs, that waft love's murmured words, And soften them to music more divine! Alas! some other voice perchance than mine May pour its plaint in thy forgetful ear: Yet noâI will not nurse those thoughts of fear, Oh, tell meâwill thy soul remember still? Will thy swoln heart and quickened pulses thrill With recollected tones of mineâonce dear Beyond all heaven's spring music to thine ear? To golden lands I goâto glorious shores, Where the sweet sunshine streams, and heaves, and pours, As though 'twould turn each glittering leaf to fire, Which thrills and murmurs like a wakening lyre To the rich musk-wind's breathingsâsweeping past With spells, and gifts, that ev'n might flush the waste; Where birds, flowers, skies, magnificently strange, Astonish and enchant with ceaseless change! Yet, though they momently may touch and charm My melancholy heart, till throng and swarm Emotions long suppressedâtoo soon, alas! Those fine emotions melt away and passâ To leave a desert's dreary span behind, That worst of desertsâa dejected mind; The after-thoughtânay, even the under-strain, Burdened with sorrowing tenderness and pain! And indistinct, but deep, will be the gloom Haunting those scenes of rainbow-coloured bloom; And thouâO! say, wilt thou accord one sigh To hallow and to embalm my memory? Wilt thouâmy life's own treasureâwilt thou cast One weeping glance on the unanswering past? Yet, no! fix not thy vain beseeching gaze On the dull track of ne'er-returning days; Turn to the future thy deep-speaking eyes, And speed its passage from the pitying skies. REMEMBRANCES. Remembrances! coiled ivies of the heart, That grasp and crush it, till its life-drops start,â Your gordianed coils, your ravelled tendrils loose; Unwind from my sad thoughts those chain-links close; Let me, oh! breathe glad currents of fresh airâ Drink draughts of pure sweet watersâfree from careâ Welling from the unborn years; let me not droop For evermore beneath a blighted hope; My heart was free as a wild bird's of yoreâ Must it be seared and haunted evermore? Hope's precious rains have brought but poisonous plants, Doubts, terrors, memoriesâtill my sick soul pants Even as a hunted deerâand dies away In passionate yearnings for some calmer day, When Memory may her arrowy sceptre break, And from the soul her burdening mantle shake; When the out-stretched Future, like a breezeless sea, Shall shine in undisturbed transparency, Troubled by no far-lengthening shadows, cast From the horizon of the westering past. Remembrances, dark ivies of the heart, Your thorn-like tendrils through my soul ye dart; All greenly branching round the ruins old Of time, by ye o'ergloomed a thousand-fold! O, but release meâlet me win repose, Or be the victim but of present woes! Now, when, with morning beautifully red, Glows every hill and valley far outspreadâ While wakening birds flit 'mongst the dancing leavesâ Singing beneath the o'ershadowing household eaves! Ye, ye, with breeze-like voices swell the strain, Refining each emotion into pain! Till morning, with her scents, and blooms, and lights, Is haunted as lone hours of deepest nights. Those breeze-like voices, too, are ever heard When greets the ear the softly-warbled word; That warbled word sung by some gentle voice That once could wake the spirit to rejoice. O that those voices could be drowned or stilled, Or the racked sense with but their tones be filled! But nowâto walk 'mongst shadowy parted hours, Dreamy existences, mysterious powers, And yet be girt by all the bonds of life,â Bowed by its actual grief and present strifeâ This is a master-agonyâ'tis mine! Oh, must it beâtill lulled on shores divine?â Remembrancesâdark ivies of the heartâ Crush it, constrictor-like, at once, or part! FROM INEZ. AN UNPUBLISHED POEM. Alas! to me all beauty now is gloomâ All landscapes but dim precincts of thy tomb! A weight sinks heart, and soul, and brain; Old Sorrow sits in melancholy state O'er ev'ry scene, where laughing Joy once sate. False art thou! oh, false art thou, Joyâand vain! The opening buds of spring would droop and die, Touched by the breath of winter's freezing sigh, His icy-cold and perilous caress; E'en so, 'neath Disappointment's troubled sway, Those cherished flowers have wept their lives away, Young hope, and blossoming happiness! Beautiful art thou, hope of burning youth, Touching all things with hues as bright as truth; Painfully beautiful and bright thou artâ Since happiness, that ever-shooting star, Seemingly near, but, ah! how coldly far! Ne'er tracks thy fairy footsteps in the heart. For meâsome haunting shadows sway me still; Through my worn heart some quickening tremours thrill, Affection's phantoms, and her watchwords low! Yet these but leave my soul more murk and dim, When they, like bubbles from a goblet's brim, To darkness and oblivion melt and flow. And spring's rich songs and bright triumphant blooms But stir and wake my heart's deep, haunting glooms Even unto mightier and more torturing life, Since, O! beside a voiceless hearth I sit, While forms familiar through the darkness flit, Kindled by memory's wild creative strife. My hope, my happiness, are wandering dreams, Wild summer-lightnings, fitful meteor-gleams, Things ever swift to part, to fade, to passâ My hope hath been a long, long-troubled spring, A stringless lute, a bird with broken wingâ My happinessâmy happiness-alas!â But, be it so! My fainting heart, arise! They left thee for their own sweet native skiesâ There follow fearlesslyâthere find them thou!â There, once united, ye shall never part; Soar, then, like them away, my burning heart; The crowning moment of long years be now! Sing, sing, ye young birds of the rushing spring; Ye gorgeous clouds, your dazzling shadows fling, As playfully and hurriedly ye float; I have a precious music in my soul, Bright heaven-girt dream-worlds through its stillness roll, Linked with high worlds remote. Bloom, bloom, ye flowers of costly scent and hue; Ye wandering winds, your trackless course pursue; I envy not your beauty, nor your might! Hope's amaranthine blooms shall glow, enshrined Deep in my spirit, and my soaring mind Shall pierce where wildest wind ne'er shaped its flight. CHANGES. FROM INEZ. A change, a spell of change, is on me now; A shadowy cloudland floats round all below; An aching heart I bearâan altered brow; Yet know not why. No more I seek the deep and odorous shade, By clustered citrons and flowered myrtles made; No more the crown of glorious roses braid, Red as eve's sky; No longer love the wild bird's raptured lay, Thrilling each bright-veined leaf and quivering spray, Nor carol through the long, long summer's dayâ Once, once 'twas so. Now, alteration's on me and around; No more with breezy step I dance and bound, While every fleeting moment, flowery-crowned, Still seemed to glow. No; all is altered! I the most of all; The working of the spell, the ill, the thrall, From me doth riseâon me, on me doth fallâ The change is mine. Still beautiful is summer, morning, earth, Abounding still with life's exulting mirth; 'Tis from my soul this haunting gloom hath birth, Which fears refine. The youth from that deep soul hath passed away, Mute, mute, and mournful through heaven's loveliest day; Fallen are the full-blown flowers of life's sweet May, Its lights are fled. The odours and colours o'er my pathway thrown, Shadowed or scattered, or like breezes flownâ O, heart! that spell of change was all thine own, Though wild and dread! Spring's golden airs, nor summer's golden skies, Can breathe back hope when hope for ever dies, Nor smooth life's ravelled thread of mysteries; It cannot beâ It cannot be; and if it could, I feel My dark affections would unbidden steal, To twine round dreams no language may revealâ The dreams of memory! Dreams of the lost, the past, the dear, the dead, Like pallid silver veins through darkness led, Most precious, though in that dim murky bed Shrined and enshrouded. Ah! beautiful and more beautiful thou becomest, Summer, that through the earth rejoicing roamest, When o'er the desert's one green spot thou bloomest, Fair and unclouded! O! beautiful and more beautiful thou art, Nature! unto a schooled and chastened heart, Which shall to keener feelings swell and start, Beneath thy sway! All undistracted by Life's petty cares, Moored from its storms, and fenced in from its snares, Beguiled from its thorn-roughened thoroughfares, Till rapt away! THE FROWN. As the Bulbul o'erpowered the young rose of the dell With the melody-breathings he showered o'er her blushes, Thy voice waked my soul with its mastering spell; Still it reigns in that soul, though in echo's faint gushes. As the morning-beam flashed o'er the foam of the sea, And burned o'er the pale spray, like roses on snow; So the sun of thy smile blazed in beauty on me, And called laughter's lightnings from cheeks blanched with wo! As the sweet crescent silvered the dark-branching tree, As she thrilled the dim leaves with her glimpsings of splendour; So thy glance lit my thoughts, which, illumined by thee, Shone all cloudlessly brightâyet all tremblingly tender. As that cypress-tree shrouded the flowery-crowned glade, As the cloud-masses darkened the landscape's warm glow, As the night its stern weight on the bright waters laid; So thy frown overshadowed my heart and my brow. It came like a dream! let it dream-like depart! Must my happiness brief as 'twas beautiful be? Must I watch the slow-withering death of my heart, When its life and that happiness hang but on thee? ART AND NATURE. In the clear day-spring of my youth, When life's winged pageants smiled like truth, Oft did I tread the regal hall, Gorgeous with midnight festival, Where coloured lamps shed softly round Their fitful splendours, and the sound Of thrilling instruments was heard, Softened to suit the whispered word. âBut were those glad scenes dear to me? Was my heart filled with melody? Were my thoughts bathed in rosy light? Could they even charm my wayward sight? âOh, none can ever dream or know All then I felt of fevered wo! Nor what a gracious sweet relief (As to a mother's yearning grief Some lost child were returned at last, And on her beating bosom cast), It was to me to quit those halls And those illumined festivals, And pass from all the pomps of art Into the fresh air of the heartâ Into my thought's proud solitude, The chainless mind's infinitude!â The bright, bright silence of my dreams, That world of sounds, and hues, and gleams! To nature's keyless sanctuaries, The breezy hills, the breathless skies, Rejoining with sweet raptures keen Old memories garnered in each scene. Thus, though I sorrowed bitterly, High blessings were reserved for me, A costly recompense was mine In those past days, ere Hope's decline Impoverished mine imaginings, And chained my fancy's rainbowed wings. Then my heart, soaring breezily, Rushed like a freed bird to the sky, Out-thrilled the skylark's ringing lays, With music of its joy and praiseâ With its deep fervid passionate tones, Its inborn mighty unisons. Oft the heart's melodies are deep, For the heart's arteries bleed and weep, Each languishing and lengthening tone, Till ev'ry breath is sorrow's own! But in that spring-burst of my youth, I deemed my veriest fancies truth; And O'twas joy beyond all joys, Such as ne'er ends, nor tires, nor cloys, To pass from all the pomps of art Into the fresh air of the heart! To nature's sweet unmasked revealings, The fresh air of the unbounded feelings! THE INJUNCTION. When all is o'er for me on this bright earth, Mourn me, with dove-like sweetness, in thy sorrow. Not with wild anguish! With the desert's dearth, Let thy worn heart the desert's calmness borrow!â Its calmness, sunniness, and breezeless hush, A waiting still its promised flowering-time! When, like the rose's heart, its depths shall flush Rich with resplendence of day's vernal prime. O, wait our meeting-hour in dream-fraught peace! It yet shall be, though long years part us first; O, let thy soul's long-wearying conflicts cease! Fountains shall flow to quench earth's deadliest thirst. When I am wrapt in silence and the grave, Go, wander by yon ever-wandering river! Ofttimes we've watched its bluely-glancing wave Togetherâbut 'tis done. Alas! we sever. That voiceful stream, by water-lilies crownedâ Oft on their wave-glassed images we've gazed, While noontide's pomp burnt gorgeously around, And all but these in fierce refulgence blazed. Dream to the chiming of yon gleamy fountain, Dream of the hours we've marked its lovely play, While the broad sun yet steeped the reddening mountain With the last floating splendours of his ray. Go, in the shadow of remembered hours Sit listening to the song of our own bird; Braid me a death-crown of night-blowing flowers, Nor let my name be a forgotten word. The sweet familiar tasks we shared of yore I would, from time to time, ye should repeat; O, think of me when all for me is o'er! Yet be the memory calmly, gravely sweet. REMEMBER! Remember!â'twas the last low-whispered sound Which struck my ear, even in that parting hour; Still my heart's tendrils, round its echoes wound, Thrill to that recollected tone of powerâ Of strange dread power o'er all my being's waste, Whose fountains sealed, flowed chainless in the past. Remember!âere those thoughts and thou canst part, Changed must thou be, my heart! Softâsofter than the broken tremulous breathings Of some veined, rainbowed shell's smooth-hollowed wreathingsâ That last, that ever-haunting murmur, fell Within my heart's coreâfixed to brood and dwell For ever and for ever! O, fear not That for one lightning-moment 'tis forgot. Remember!âay; ere that and thou canst part, Changed must thou be, my heart! Methought, in my young days of fiery life, When every thought of Spring and Hope was rife, That the soft nightingale's deep-throbbing throat Poured an entrancing and victorious note; But I have heard thy voice! and now, not soâ The nightingaleâthe nightingale may go! Remember!âay; ere that and thou canst part, Changed must thou be, my heart! We parted in the sunset's hour of rest, When a rich silence broods along the breast; And the soul turns, by impulse softly given, From dreams of passion unto dreams of heaven! Thus linked with loftiest feelings of the soul, Those memories kindlingly and proudly roll! Remember!âay; ere that and thou canst part, Changed must thou be, my heart! That parting hour! through mists of after-yearsâ Through chequered destinies and chastening tears, How vividly it shines!â'Tis here again! With its dark transports and its conquering painâ Its exquisite joyâand, ah! its exquisite wo! Remember!âyes; till in the grave laid low! Remember!âay! ere that and thou canst part, Dead must thou be, my heart! THE CONSOLATION. Myriads of creatures breathe joyous breath, While she lies asleep on her bed of death; Myriads of creatures still bless the sunâ For her the sweet glories of earth are done! The Summer, with all her gifts and her spells, In vain round her place of abiding dwells; Her most precious breathings are powerless hereâ Her loveliest splendours shew dim and drear; Her thousands of roses are scattered in vain, Her flower-lighting dews and perfuming rainâ Those dancing and fragrant rains, that shine Like diamond-sparks of some rifted mine. But Summer in vain o'er the waste must sweepâ Summer broods colourless o'er the old deep; And Death, that mightiest of all the earth, Is deaf to her voices of hope and mirth. Summer and Death! O! they mournfully meet With conflicting influence strange and sweet; For Summer hath glorious airs and skies; And our thoughtsâthose young immortalities!â Will link their loveliness with a breath Of the eternal being that knows not death! Thus, Summer and Death may solemnly meet, And with bright and breathless stillness greetâ But she who, in silence and darkness, now Hath bowed her head and hath veiled her browâ In joy and in summer she takes no part, Though, as a breeze, they once ruffled her heart. In the unsunned sabbath of the tomb, Allâall is weighty and frozen gloom. The sabbath of the tomb!ânot so! Thou'rt where the immortal fountains flow; Where fitful cloud or changeful breeze Comes not 'mongst ever-flowering trees; Where no wavering shadows fall nor floatâ Lingers no echo's lamenting noteâ No perishing flowerâno withering leaf, Sheds round a something like care and grief! Thy starry being hath nought to fear Of the change and ruin awaiting us hereâ Thou'rt 'mongst the unwithering golden bowers, Which own not the reign of earth's cloudy hours, Where life is music and precious light, Unbroken by sighsâunbreathed on by blight; While the softly rosy and crystal air Is thrilled but by seraph-breathings there! O! that summer of heaven shall pass not away, Nor eve's hyacinth hues o'ersweep the bright day! In thoughts like these I can hang o'er thy tomb, Nor feel its infection of desolate gloom; They gird my soul with a haughty joyâ Haughty!ânot so; pure from earth's alloy,â O! pure from aught of prevailing dust Be my thoughts of thee!âand they mustâthey must! Yet moaning, like troubled waters, low, Through my thrilled soul, some streams of wo At times will pass, like the clouds that cross Our summer heav'n; then I feel but thy lossâ Ay! sounds and shadows, now dwelling, now dying, Like south-winds through broken harp-strings sighing, Will sway me with sudden and hidden power, Till I shrink from Mem'ry's long-treasured dower. O, there's not a birdâa starâa leafâ That hath not her spell to awaken grief, Didst thou in thy triumph's hour, beautiful Hope! Not sustain a spirit too prompt to droop! Summer, and Love, and Death, are here, Yet my soul shall not bow to bitter fear; But with strengthened consciousness,âheightened trust,â Pass its fleeting hour in its coil of dust! Till, forgetting what 'twas to moan and weep, With one conquering burstâwith one mastering sweepâ It shall shoot away from all bonds and chains To realms where the fulness of glory reigns! Beyond the worlds, the graves, the stormsâ Where, crowned for Eternity, glorious formsâ Mightyâin uttermost beauty shine, And Love, undimmed by Death, is divine! With thoughts like these in my silent breast, I keep vigils calm o'er thy place of rest, With a solemn tendernessâchastened hopeâ That dares not, and deigns not, to sink and droop; But most by the precious thoughts sustained Of our spirit-meetingâunchecked, unchained! Where soul unto soul shall bound and cling, And Grief melt away a forgotten thing! THE MOURNER. Not a wordânot a word, the mourner said, But she languidly raised her drooping head, And her cheek flushed through her tears; And O! the tulip o'ercharged with dew, With her glorious heart-leaves gleaming through, Not half so bright appears! Many a braid did dishevelled float Down the proud swanniness of her throat, And glossy they were, and shining; And in many a fitful and fevered streak The colour lightened along her cheekâ Now deepening, and now declining! No dews shall revive that drooping vine, Bid that broken rose in fresh glory shine, Nor give back the crushed harp's melodies! That wounded bird to its nest restore, That stricken deer to its haunts of yore, Nor the lost star to midnight's skies. But gentlyâgently shall she part, For the lovely life at her panting heart Fast ebbs and melts away: In dreams of the far-off heavens she dwellsâ 'Mongst the spring-leaves' murmurs hears boding knellsâ And she sighsâyet she would not stay! The greensward's haunts of the violet, soon Shall hide from all that meek heart undoneâ Let her go to her dreamless rest. When the summer melts soft from wood and vale, She shall shrink to the grave, all pure and pale, E'en as to a mother's breast! SONG. [Voices ariseâthe sweet of tone] Voices ariseâthe sweet of tone, Emparadising even mine ear; But my heart still is all alone, Since thineâthine is not here. I hear soft words and softer notes, Gushings of Song and Poetryâ The lark's strains, as he heavenward floats, But mock Love's farewell words to me! Young shapes shine forth in Beauty's light, As if to chide my wayward eye, That can find none or fair or bright But thineâor its loved memory! I see sweet glancesâsweeter smiles, Like summer-evening lightnings play; Vainly for me they spread their wilesâ Thineâthine are far away! And what is all of sweet or bright To me, who to sad thoughts incline? To whom the loveliest form of light Is dimânear memory of thine? Then O, fair aspects! voices sweet! Emparadising eye and ear, Forgive, if I forbear to greetâ Or greet ye with a tear! THE LOVER'S PRAYER. Oh, turn not thus, turn not from me, For that I'm sad and dark of moodâ A thing of tears and mystery, Of silence and of solitude. I would not grieve thy gentler heart With the trouble of mine own; Sorrow and I can seldom partâ Then let us meet alone! Yet, let not these enforced revealings Chase from thy cheek the radiant glow; Was't my fault if my heart's best feelings Proved its worst fates?âAh, surely, no! Then, turn not thou aside that face, All eloquent of purest love! Vainly my mind hath searched through space For joyâit ne'er might prove! Now, peace my wounded spirit craves,â That long hath mourned, and sighed Like night-winds over nameless graves, Whence no voice e'er replied! And wilt thou turn from this crushed mind, And from this long o'ertroubled heart? Wilt thou be more than allâunkind? Part we? Say, must we part? Then, darker, sadder far of mood, Shall I, of all bereft, becomeâ The sweet star of my solitude, The one flower of my living tomb! A REMEMBERED SCENE. I wandered where in youth I oft had beenâ It was a soothing, unbewildering scene: Old trees stood in their gracious beauty round, Casting their massy shadows on the ground; The flowering boughs wove many a verdurous screen Of tremulous-shining bloom and varying green, In dim pavilions of delight and rest, For those with passions schooled and lessoned breast. And the brook led its gentle music by, And glanced back all the colourings of the sky, Threading its way through that green whispery wood With sweet apprisings of its neighbourhood To ev'ry passer-by! And there the bird, At oft-repeated intervals, was heard To pour his unpremeditated strain, And thenâdeep holy quiet reigned again! And one faint, faintest star shone meekly bright, Ministrant of soft influence to the night That onwards came, with regal mien and crown, And dews and star-rays showered together down! 'Twas the old haunt of my enchanted years, Ere conversant with Sorrow's blinding tears And Passion's sway, and Disappointment's lore, That have enchained me now for evermore. The rich breath of the violet floated there, As sweet as in those days unclaimed by care; And ev'ry hour I have in suffering passed Hath here been softly tracedâserenely glassed!â As though there were no world beyond of gloomâ Like Paradise, unconscious of a tomb! Henceforth, high Nature! let me all address My thoughts and powers to thee! girt less and less With earth, and more and more with thy strong ties, Thy unimaginable sublimities! Till, hallowed to that nature's sweet repose My heart may be, though weighed down by its woes Too long, too utterly! 'Tis not too late That high and holy calm to emulate! To mirror back that nature be its lot; And O! to reap heaven's smiles, like this sweet spot. A HUMAN VOICE. Was't a bird sang those few triumphant notes? Still lovingly in the air the echo floats. Was't a bird's glorious singing, fresh from shores Where flowers breathe incense from their starry cores! Incense, and rainbowed sunshine, till the breeze Wafts but unwillingly ev'n notes like these, Lingering around a spot so blest, so bright, Though tempted on through vistas of warm light? O, 'twas no bird! the soul that quickened thereâ Thoughts, feelings, passions, with their touch of careâ Poured thrilling by! The high, immortal mind Seemed ev'n in those few fleeting sounds enshrined, Mighty and burning! and each varying tone Had a prevailing meaning of its own. Life's spiritual sympathies were stirredâ A kindred nature there was felt and heard; The soul acknowledged pure and primitive ties, Too long obscured by clouding mysteries. My being all seemed lost in listening deep, While, breathing soft as hope or rosiest sleep, That voice o'erwhelmed me, sending through my soul Soft lightnings of emotions, till it stole All bitterness from my dreams, now calm and sweet, Like flowers refreshed from noontide's burdening heatâ The Happy, in their sweet dreams, scarce more blest, âThough crowned with consciousness the full-fraught breast!â Whose hopes are stars!ânot treacherous lures which glow To make the unwatchful work their proper woâ Whose dreams are lovely prophecies of good! Not sibyl-leaves, perchance misunderstood Till fearfully fulfilled!âwhose pulses thrill With joy, when wakening to be happier stillâ Who smile as on distemperatures and mists, On visions that the wretch who scarce exists, Yet feels life as a load, would prize and bless, Even as a brief and costly happiness! Oh! breezelike voice!âsoft as Spring's breathings deep, Calling all glorious blooms from wintry sleep! Once more o'erpower me with unchecked delight, Freeing my spirit from its freezing blight. ON THE NIGHTINGALE. 'Tis night, and 'twould be silence but for thee, Spirit of multitudinous melody, Deep nightingale! The very fire of heaven Seems to thy throbbing strain intensely given, And all the unsounded passion-fountains deep That ever heaved the soul, o'erflow and steep Those burning harmonies, that seem to rock The weight of darkness on them with keen shock And gust tempestuous! Mighty, mighty bird, In thy sweet strength pre-eminent! Hope deferred, And wounded love! here come for draughts of healing! Now, nought but those victorious notes are pealing Throughout the darkly-glorious night! no breath Of winds is heard. All, all lies hushed as death! And although thunders groaned and threatened roundâ Through the deep thickening tumults should resound That heavenward-mounting strain, that floods the air With beauty almost too intense to bear, In its mysterious power and wondrous might Softening the savage grandeur of the night. Alas! the rugged real it softeneth notâ Life's disappointments still are unforgot Even by thy listener's heart! The music-land Is haunted by a dreamy shadowy bandâ The heart's lost hopes and loves, the dead, the dearâ The broken flowers of memoryâchanged and sereâ Crushed, wrecked affections, bound in withered sheaf, And all the phantom retinue of grief! But, O! these bitter truths, why come they now To wring this long-sealed heart, this long-veiled brow? Through music's spirit-land glide there no forms But those bowed down by life's unpitying storms? No Futures, that, serenely pure and bright, Rise mantled round with fair transparent light? Like soft and beautiful exhalations rise, Nor cease to soar until they reach the skies? No schooled affections, like earth's fountains, plenished From the majestic heaven-deeps when evanished?â Their lovely sources seem in some fierce droughtâ No chastened hopes, sublimed by soaring thought? âThese may be there; but hearts of love and pride Lean to their earthly more than heavenly sideâ Would it were not so! Would that any wo Could alienate this heart from things below! Wouldâwould the associative links were torn From the close chain my heart so long hath worn! Then might I hear thee, wondrous bird, and hang On thy deep lays, nor feel the maddening pang Accompanying those rich notes! Oh, why Must they still call on buried memory? Why, like electric wands and lightning rods, But smite grief's deeply-bosomed veiled abodes? O! cease to send those searching, searching darts!â Profoundly sorrowing still to sorrowing hearts Thou seem'st! and well, O well, it may be so, When thy high song, the loveliest heard below, Reminds the soul, of all earth's sounds the most, Of that pure paradise for ever lost, For ever on this leafy, flowery earthâ Wild scene of conflicts, triumphs, death, and mirth. What part of time, or of eternity, Hath sway o'er that most mighty harmony? The Past, the Present, or the dim To-come? Art thou an exile from a viewless home? And is't a rapture of expectancy That crowns each full victorious melody? O, how each tone doth pierce through th' answering spirit! No earthly echoes should that strain inheritâ That thunder-shower of music, thick and deep, Startling the long-resounding night from sleep, Which scarce sustains that precious weight of sound, Disquieting the haunted calm aroundâ Now, with quick, billowy, and fiery floods Thrilling the moonlighted and flowering woodsâ Now, with the sweetnesses of sorrowing tones, As music sighed from all her thousand thrones On earth, and through the fair enchanted domes Of yon starr'd skies, where spirits build their homes!â Now, with wreathed tortuosities of soundâ Rich harmoniesâinextricably woundâ O, do they cleave the heavens or strike the ground?â Sinking within its depths like lightning strokes That smite and scathe the immemorial oaksâ The forest-kings, even in their playful scorn? Or is each tone on viewless pinions borne? O, whether it disperses or aspires, That lay, that out-throbs all earth's noblest lyresâ Even lever-like it doth upheave the soul, While on the sense the volumed concords roll! âYet wherefore dost thou pour and rain away Thy sweet strength on the night? O, let the dayâ The golden laughing dayâthose sounds receive; With every ray a song of triumph weave; Mingle thy pure impassioned breathings still With heaven's own splendours, free from stain or chill; Let the great sunâthe glowing sun aboveâ Tremble to thy assaults of piercing love! There, pour away thy passion and thy soulâ There seek thy fiery spirit's fiery goal! 'Mongst the winged clouds that all unshackled shoot, Though vast as mountains of a century's root! 'Mongst the spring-heads of music and of lightâ 'Mongst all things glorious, beautiful, and bright! TO THE LARK. Soar! soar! and sing for ever, glorious Lark! And thou, O cold dull Earth, behold and hark; Morning and music, melody and bloom, Their rapturous reign triumphantly resume. Go forth, thou mighty warbler! strike the sky, And in an understrain of sweet, reply. The fountains of its echoes forth shall flow, Till they rebound against this earth belowâ Till all the dewy silvery air is shivering, Like some transparent censer, wherein, quivering, A thousand, thousand fires are pent, that leap, And rush, and strive, as panting to escape. O, shalt thou not, all unreproved, be heard? And shalt thou not be hailed, deep-hearted bird, By all earth's tribes, though pouring drops of fear Into the sinner's heart and sluggard's ear? Ne'er shalt thou by the conflicts and the cares Of dark life be deterredâwhile smiling wears The morn her glistening diadem, and flowers, Unfolding, tell of blue, blue summer hours, And fair elysian haunts, and worlds of beauty! Thou shalt not be deterred from thy sweet dutyâ While springs the fawn and roams the honey-bee, And spreads the sunshine's robe of royalty! Hark! hark! how thrillingly they swell and rise, Those heaven-electrifying harmonies! The dervishes of the East are little zealous Compared with thee, who seem'st each morning jealous Of thy past efforts, and dost, more and more Careering, wheel and spin, and heavenward soar. And now thy glorious place is nobly won, While welcomes with his priceless smiles, the sunâ His indefatigable worshipper! Nowânow a soft and pleasurable stir Runs joyously through all the unshattered air, While witcheries and delights spring every whereâ Enchantments, pleasures, wonders, dreams of love, Start to our senses wheresoe'er we moveâ Even at the call of that winged wizard bright, While surging rosier round him streams the light. Blest bird! what sweet prerogatives are thine! For thee the day-spring's rays of beauty shineâ Thine are the firstling breezes of the prime, The bloom upon the hours of summer timeâ Those opening gloriesâthose unfolding pleasuresâ Far richer than the noontide's crimsoner treasures. Behold, how each, like some enchanted sphere, The morn-reburnished clouds on high appear, Gathering into a rich and rosy ark, As if to tempt thee, lonelyâloneliest Lark, To stayâforgetful of a world of gloom, And, ah! forgetful of thy leaf-girt home. But, no! thy rapturous orisons achieved, Thou hurriest back unto thy mate bereaved! As if by viewless link or loadstone drawn From the azure-portalled temple of the dawn, Thou meltest like a raindrop from the sky, Then sink'st into thy nest,âthat leafy shellâ That dim and sheltering coveâthat fragrant cellâ That mossy haunt,o'er which each breeze hath blown, Throbbing with heart-fraught harmonies thine ownâ Thine own exulting and adoring strains, That flash to earth, like silvery summer-rains! Or quivering storms of whirlwind-adoration, Lashing the unbounded ocean of creation! But O! not yet hast silently declined That music, searching through the soul and mind; Still rings, even with redoubled peals, around That lovely tumult of unwearying sound! Those glorious burstsâthose harmonies superb, Even with keen tremulous ecstasy disturb All who have sense to listen, souls to feel, And hearts whose strings are not of stubborn steel! O, beautiful is this pureâpure happiness, With nought to avoid, to banish, or suppress! Beautiful is this happiness we share With the bright innocent populace of air! Beautiful the happiness that from above Doth tremble! Bird, thou hast been a thief of love! Bringing us thoughts, dreams, visions, phantasiesâ All breathing of the sunny radiant skies! Yet bring me none. Alas! I fearâI fear, Lest they should Hope's delusive aspect wear! Bird, bear my hopes away on thy strong wing, Thou privileged and emancipated thing! Even those my heart has cherished unavowedâ Bear them beyond the tempest and the cloud, Unto those shining tracts, in glory strong, Bequeathed, and blent with the echoes of thy song In that rich orient Paradise of Light! In that immortal air! which gloom or blight Shall never reach, since farâoh! far away Those regions stretch, and far art thouâare theyâ From earth's bleak graves! and from their shadows cold, Though where the wandering clouds thy form enfold, Perchance, from time to time! But they have dyes Won from the sunriseâchangeful brilliancies, Redeeming them from sadness and from gloomâ Ah, how unlike the shadows of the tomb! And far thou art from the endless mist of tears, That dims the flowery crown high Nature wears, And half obliterates her divinest hues! Though 'mongst the fountains of the lovely dews Those long-resounding harmonies take birth, Which pour a deluge of delight on earth; Farâfar from grief's unlanguageable sighsâ Though where the harping blast doth sweep and rise! Heaven's charged Intelligencer thou would'st seem, The interpreter of many a wildering dream! Earth's sweet Misrepresentative thou artâ Oh! would she bore as true and free a heart! But she and all her sons remain supine, Whilst thou greet'st morning with a love divineâ Thou wrestler with her breezy boundless spirit; Thou conqueror, that shalt evermore inherit Her wond'rous wealth of joyâkeen, mystic, wildâ And breathed but through thy pÃ¦ans undefiled! Thou sweet, sweet spendthrift of thy priceless pleasure, Scattered about without reserve or measureâ Thou harmony-quickened sparkâand spring of beingâ Unintermittent lightning!âDream unfleeing! Thou that art now, even now, high poised in air, As though thy home, thy world, thy heaven was there, And throbbing like a new-discovered star, Most radiant where a thousand thousand are Unto th' astronomer's enraptured ken!â Thou keen reproach to silent-hearted men!â Thou beating pendulum 'twixt heaven and earth! Art thou, as from their immemorial birth The stars have been, sustained by soft attraction? No!âfree thou'rt still, in spirit as in actionâ Free! and it is thy glad and glorious choice To aspire, to adore, to extol, and to rejoice! A feathered culverin, thou seem'st to pour Thy shots of living fire still more and more! While the beleaguered clouds surrendering seem To melt round thee like vapours in a dream. Thou fluttering telegraph 'twixt land and sky! For O! thou art no child of mysteryâ No incommunicative cell thy breast, Which pants with glad emotions unsuppressed! Nor unintelligible be thy signs Of bliss, which still the unquestioning heart divines! Nor unintelligible be the bliss, The upspringing from so dark a world as this! And art thou not an argosy of cost, Freighted with treasures for the outstretched coast Of the most mighty heavens?âAh, do not we Who watch thy jubilant progress, far and free, Pour our soul's priceless, countless riches forth, And charge thee with them, as thou spring'st from earth! The passionate dreams and flashing Inspirations, Trembling affections and proud aspirations, And glorious hopes, within the soul unrolledâ The heavenward hopes that cannot be controlled!â I've bade thee fly with mine. Ah, bear them far, Those hopes that fain would soar o'er sun and star! Bear them where all the purple air is burning, E'en now, with incense, sunshine, and the morning! Morning!âO how, like a vibrating harp, Whose mighty chords no time nor tears can warp, Doth she thrill tremulously round thee now! To extract her soul of sweetness skilled art thou, And to transfuse it through our beating bosoms, Revivifying feelings oldâas blossoms Discoloured are by dews revivified! And thou'st compelled deep dreams of power and prideâ Even from the soul's abysses! forth they riseâ Delights, and hopes, and shadowy mysteries, Speechless Abstractions, Terrors, Splendours, Glooms, Imaginations borne on seraph plumes! Passions, and Ecstasies, and keen Perceptions, And lightning-pinioned Phantasms and Conceptions, And starry Ardours, breathless Expectations, Beatitudes, and fervid Adorations, And bright Amazements, that, transfixed and still, Yet with a rapture of assurance thrill! Glorying Enthusiasms that awake To spurn earth's fetters, and her trammels break!â To soar from world to worldâfrom height to height, Till lost at last in unimagined light! And with them wakeâappearâand with them rise Winged Joys! veiled Triumphs! sceptered Destinies! These throng around us when the o'erarching skies Are flooded by thy melody, and all Lies clasped in music's dewy, silvery thrall. These rise when from the shadowless blue above Burst thy precipitated calls of love! When doth with cloudless auguries commence Thy skyey saturnalia!âpure, intense! Ah, let a heart of wounded love but share Thy breezy bliss, ere crushed into despair! Too bitterly and wildly well it knows It had escaped its martyrdom of woes, Had it, like thee, made offerings of the best, The earliest feelings of the awakening breast. But now thou wing'st thy swift way back to earth, Where swells thy plumaged kindred's lowlier mirth, Bright-coloured birds that pierce the flowering glades, And cross with chequering gleams the verdurous shades! Mount! mount again, enchanter! Mount again, Thou that canst charm the serpents of old painâ Thou that canst draw the arrow from the wound, By the celestial sorceries of sound! And that canst give to memory's treasured tears A rainbowed light!âsoothe agonising ears That pine for dearer sounds! and keep suppressed The feverish yearnings of the unanswered breast!â Canst bid departed phantoms start and live, And disenchanted dreams at once revive! From Hope's wild-rose the threatening thorn canst takeâ From Grief's bowed from the lead-like mantle shakeâ From Pleasure's honey-bee the treacherous sting Canst wile, and lend to joy thy song and wing!â From Fancy's rainbow-pictures sweep the stainâ The wormwood from the passion-fountains drainâ The burning passion-fountains of the soul, Which, freed by music any by thee, shall roll O'er beds of pearls, and precious sands of gold, And shells like those where Love lay couched, of old, Still answering! while thou seem'st to pour on high A milky-way of music through the sky! But yet do more, sweet minister of bliss! YetâI adjure theeâyet do more than this! O, prophet-like, unveil the years to comeâ The unborn, supine, remoteâpierce their far home Beyond the curtaining clouds! Yet, no! Forbear! Ah, rather teach the soul to bruntâto dareâ To face them undismayed! Rather prevail Its own majestic inner worlds to unveilâ Its rich resourcesâits unfathomed mines! Where many a treasure-hoard unrecked-of shines! Then will we urge thee not those realms to explore, When thou canst doânay, hast done nobly, more! Inciting sorrow's languid heart to adore, Leading the steps of erring reason right, And bathing thought in floods of smiling light! Thou blithe adventurer of the untracked skiesâ Thou leader of divinest enterpriseâ Pilgrimâprobationer of the aÃ«rial heights, To thee a wilderness of blooms and lights! Still thou appearest, brightly lone, to be The anchorite of the gorgeous cloudlands free! To Fancy's eye thou seem'st a mystic wheel, Round which careering worlds, with echoing peal, Are driven, triumphant, jubilant, ecstatic, Reclaimed from journeyings wide and maze erratic! And unto heavenliest harmony constrained, Within whose smooth, smooth circles bound and chained, They evermore shall shape their measured course, Won by mysteriously prevailing force! Thou shell of multitudinous melodies, Instinct with precious breathings from the skiesâ Winged sphinx! whose not inextricable meanings Our after-thoughts collect in costly gleanings! One strong emotion in that breast elate Throbsâinextinguishably passionate! One feeling floods thee, like a chainless river, Beautiful inexhaustibly!âfor ever! O! thy wild strains have manifold revealingsâ The overpowering mysteries of the feelings Have found a voiceâa glorious voiceâat length, Through which to shower their full, deep burning strengthâ Even thine! for so imagination worksâ It deems a kindred spirit in thee lurks! Thou'st imaged by thy strains, to rapture wrought, The interminable wanderings of the thought; Since high and higher! ever high and higher! They piercingly and thrillingly aspire! And when thou'rt silent, the echoes of those sounds O'erflow their tremulous and aÃ«ry bounds, And interweave themselves, with whisperings low, That from the soul's disturbed recesses flow In undistinguishable murmurings! And the quick-glancing shiver of thy wings Commingleth with wild Fancy's rainbowed dyes, In undistinguishable radiancies! (For, when thy form, erewhile, towards earth descended, It seemed to emit bright sparkles, briefly splendid; But, by the trouble of the rich air wrought, As fancy by the ruffling of the thought!) O! that I might, with thee at last ascending, Gain those calm realms where bliss reigns neverending; Thy wild rejoicings, and my deep adorings, Mingling in undistinguishable soarings! THE WARRIOR'S FAREWELL. Morning and spring-time in opening pride, The warrior on through the wild wood doth ride; And mortal never beheld, I ween, A lovelier hour, nor a lovelier scene. The reddening sun just stains his plume, The morning breeze gives forth perfume; The lark his brilliant eye uncloses, And sings rÃ©veillez to the roses! Slowly and sadly the warrior went, And his eye was fixed and his brow was bent; For his mournful task was to bid farewell To the stately and gentle Isabelle! And the rich skies were reddening around him in vain, And little recked he of the lark's joyous strain; No glance for beauty hath that fixed eyeâ That heart hath no echoes for melody! Of cramoisie and the glistering gold Was his broidered scarf's resplendent fold; Some precious love-gift it seemed to shineâ Ah, gentle Isabelle!âwas it thine? The warrior on through the wild wood doth ride, Till before him a castle frowns dark in its pride; From his saddle-bow he upraises his eyesâ Away! and away! like the arrow he flies! Now he checks his fierce charger's foamy speedâ Now he leaps from that proudly caparisoned steed; A soft smile through his gladdened soul doth dartâ A sweet voice hath melted along his heart! Hath that heart no echoes for melody nowâ That eye no glance for sweet beauty's glow? Ah! 'twas that one image, too deeply impressed, Had excludedâeffacedâall else from his breast! Fleetly flew by those enchanted hours: No festival-pomp, midst palace bowers, E'er sped the moments so breathlessly, As, winged by passion, they lightened by! But hark! 'tis the sound of a trampling hostâ Each moment now is a moment lost. Ah! what agonizing looks they cast, Who know each look should be the last! 'Tis the sweeping of the banner's foldâ 'Tis the bugle of battle shrill and boldâ 'Tis the warrior's shout!â'tis the charger's clangâ Short space have ye on that hand to hang. Mount! mount, young knight! thy war-horse waitsâ Ride forth! ride ye forth from the castle gates; 'Mongst England's flower of chivalry, The foremost, as thou'rt the stateliest, be! He leaps on his neighing war-steed now! He dashes the dark hair from his brow! Doth he dash the tears from his treacherous eyes, As he murmurs farewell midst repressless sighs? The voice!âthat sweet voiceâfrom his heart Mournfully now doth melt and part! No more may his ear on its echoes dwellâ He must hear the fierce battle-thunders swell. Yet where the battle-thunders roar Loudest, like billows that burst on the shoreâ It shall riseâit shall pierce through the trumpet's breath, And lead him to victoryâor to death! THE STRANGER. âFrom what land dost thou, stranger, come? From a flowering land as bright as ours?â âNo; but I leave my childhood's home, My father's hearths, and my mother's bowers! âThere is a spotâa sacred spotâ To memory and affection dear, Which cannot be by me forgot, Though dim the retrospect and drear.â âStranger, thou look'st into the eyes Of all that pass, with sorrowing quest, As thou sought'st face that should arise Where'er thy anxious glances rest; And I mark thee slowly turn away With a shudder and a sigh, As thou wouldst shrink from the light of day, Or the lightnings of memory! Yet those were faces fair as heaven, Which flashed back glance for glance, Which smile for smile had softly given, Or tear for tear, perchance!â âChild of the isles, those faces fair Were beauteous as calm skies above; But nought on earth, in heaven, or air, Is beautiful as love! And she, the loved one of my soul, Dwells in my land of birthâ Though worlds for waves between us roll, I see but her on earth!â âStranger, why didst thou leave that land For our fair but far-off isle, Far from thy own blessed kindred band, And thy dear one's worshipped smile?â âAnd hear ye not in these bursting sighs The exile's wild and hopeless sadness? And see ye not in these haggard eyes The exile's dark and mortal madness?â âArouse thee! and hope for evermore! Thy glance towards the future cast!â âI may find a future on any shore, But only on one the past!â âYet, wanderer, yet forbear to grieve, New friends may grace thy side.â âNew friends, 'tis true may love and liveâ There, there my old friends died! Those that from childhood's days were proved Changeless, and faithful-heartedâ Those that in boyhood's hours I lovedâ Even from their graves I'm parted!â âThe laughing heavens above thy head, Stranger, are still the same!â âAy, to the happy, and to the deadâ To me, not one pale beam! For thee, may thy young heart ne'er know, Child of these golden isles, The tears of love, its pangs, its woeâ Aught but its rosy smiles. But O, for me! I loathe life's breathâ Shrink from these alien skies aboveâ Nor reap dark joy from thoughts of death, Far from my land of love! Whose care will guard my grave? whose tears Water the weed-grown sod? I dread death's hour as life's long years!â âStranger!âhast thou no God?â DREAMS. Dreams, loveliest mutabilities of ever-changeful earth! Beauteous and precious blossoming of Time's cold desert dearth, Incarnadining life's gray mists with sun-hues of the south, And brightening life's horizon-rim with the orient fires of youth. Like the fair rainbow, linking earth to the blue exulting sky, And showering o'er the space around a flood of radiancy! O, wondrous are ye, and sublime in your phases and your powers, Wresting from care and feverish woe some few short splendid hours! From the monarch's brow ye lift the crown! the captive's chains unbind! Youth unto frozen age ye are, and light unto the blindâ A refuge and a shelter to earth's wanderers, weary-hearted, And all to the bereaved, since ye restore the long-departed! To childhood's ken, O! what a world of mystery and of glory! Surpassing all even childhood meets in the gorgeous realms of story! All dazzling dyes, all wildering light, all wonder, and all change! Where the thoughts, like birds of paradise, through an endless sunshine range! What murmurings, and what glimmerings, and what trembling thrills incessant, Through that soft air run lightly, where Hope plants her opening crescent,â And Peace, transparent Peace, through its warm luxuriance sheds its brightenings, Like dewy moonlight-rainbows wreathed with the flash of summer's lightnings! A picture-land, a music-land, sleep's wide realm must be there, Where no echo-voice of other times doth haunt the silvery airâ No faded tracery of the past doth mantle it with gloomâ No canopying clouds of night, no shadows of the tomb! Yet where the voice of other times hath the arrowy breeze enchained, Thrilling with searching sweetnesses, that scarce can be sustainedâ Despite that voice, the trace, the cloud, the shadowy gloom despite, Dreams! ye've flowery wildernesses still, of bloom and golden light! Dreams of the poet's burning mind! O! what must ye not be? Bright-pinioned travellers, that explore the unveiled immensity; That bring from many an untracked coast, and many an untouched mine, The dazzling meed of riches he receives but to resign! Yet, if his mind one lightning-glimpse of all ye brought retain, It shall bring glory without end to his mighty sweeping strain! For ye shall crown his conquering thought with all grand and starry themes, Though alone that lightning-glimpse bequeathed, shall mark your track, winged dreams! Yours are the realms of life and deathâthe realms of time and space! And the fiery-tressed comet toils behind ye in the race; The Past heaves, like a billowy sea, when ye hover o'er its gloomâ And, fearful in their beauty, rise the dwellers of the tomb! And to the painter's fervid glance what marvels ye discloseâ Your very atmosphere burns deep with the crimsonings of the rose! Sunshine through moonlight quivering gleams! beam upon beam embossed! In labyrinthine-wreathed meanderings â silvery streams with golden crossed! Perchance ye spread unrecked-of worlds before his raptured visionâ Worlds with o'erpowering beauty crowned! aÃ«rialâcrystallineâElysian! Where the spirit of all loveliness embodied seems to dwell, As the fire within the umbrageous cloud, or the pearl in the orient shell! Or, perchance, the glorious scenes of old for him ye may revive! And bid the vanished Beautifulâthe vanquished Mighty liveâ Redeem fallen cities from the dust, that hath their majesty defiled, And give them pomp they boasted not, ere time their strength despoiled. Like gorgeous jewel-pyramidsâlike genii-structures, famed of oldâ They arise with spires and column-shafts of burnished sculptured gold! With vast domes that might o'ercanopy all the unpavillioned seas! Yet ever varying, cloud-like, to his fancy's varying breeze! Or ye shadow forth triumphantly the conqueror on his car! Or the kingly leader and his hosts, when marshalled for the war! The satrap at the banquetting, the mourner at the pyreâ Or the bardâthe god-like child of songâwith his laurel-cinctured lyre. Or a shepherd-king of olden times, with his flocks on palmy plainsâ A Pythoness beside the shrine, 'midst regal Delphi's pillared fanes! Or some white-robed martyr-brotherhood, with torch and scourge barefooted led; Or th' old sacrificial festivals, where the flower-wreathed victims bled! Dreams! ye have still more boundless scope and more transcending powers, When ye borrow not your colourings from mortality's frail hours! When ye paint to Faith's adoring eyes the mysteries of the skiesâ Although then your pomps are vain, though fused with the sunset's deepest dyes. Those jewel-pyramids! star-blazoned domes!âthose piles and heaps of treasure! Those genii-structures â heavenwards reared and aimedâwithout boundary, without measure! Those gorgeous pageantries! aspiringâthrough the Elysian heights unveiledâ These must be vain, and soon obscured, though awhile their pomps prevailed. Yet, ye still leave glorious traces on the lulled and gladdened soulâ Though to Oblivion's ocean those fantastic splendours rollâ Soft spiritual traces, even like an angel's footsteps thereâ And a memory on the verdurous earth, and a token on the air. O'er that spirit that hath thirsted for the fountaindraughts of life! And battled with meek earnestness through the dark and lengthening strife; O'er whose thousand thousand thoughts and hopes, one faith hath, crown-like, hoveredâ Ye have breathed! and to its passionate gaze worlds after worlds discovered. O'er the spirit that is trembling on the threshold of its doomâ That hears in every chiming breeze a whisper of the tomb; That still by deep affections bowedâby silvery cords enthralled, Would shrink back for a while to life, though heavenwards, heavenwards called. O'er that spiritâsovereign dreams! ye shed a mastering gift of power, To pierce the cloud-o'ershadowings of earth's strange mysterious hourâ To rend through dimly-visioned worlds a bright victorious wayâ To soar into the height of heights, the excess of heaven's deep day! LINES ON MARTIN'S PAINTINGS. Upon these wonder-breathing scrolls I gaze, Lost in their boundlessness of gloom and blaze! Depth within depth of night, o'erpowering nightâ Sphere beyond sphere of light, transcending lightâ Within their span, concentered and combined, Bewilder and intoxicate the mind! Here multitudinous cities are uplifted From the dim dustâthey that were earthquakerifted, Or deluged by the rampant ocean's wavesâ Or left the site of immemorial graves! The hundred-gated capitals of old! They blaze once moreârich with barbaric gold! There bright, bright fields glow with undying bloom, Undarkened by the shadows of the tomb. O! but these visioned wonders are sublime, And lift the soul above the wrecks of time! These scenes with immortality are crowned, And own, in their imperial sway, no bound Save that of uttermost magnificence!â The excessâthe heightâthe super-eminence Of mightiest grandeur in its mightiest hour! O! marvellous is thy privilege and power, Great Painter! thy unfaltering, fearless hand Hath sovereign mastery o'er the vast and grand! Thine eye hath traversedâmeasuredâovercomeâ The heights, the abysses of all light and gloom! Hath flashed along the immeasurable void, As some winged comet, on its journeyings wide, Flashes from space to space! and we behold The banners of thy triumph's hour unrolled. Hast thou thy hand, untrembling, undismayed, Upon the Future's shadowy mane victorious laid; Or struck the dark rock of th' impassive Past, Till forth the fountains gushed! full, deep, and fast? What spirits ministrant to thy great mind, Have in its depths amassedâcompressedâenshrined These boundless treasures, those rich stores of light, Which have no name, no price, no end? Proud freight! O! what have been the wands, the lightning rods, Wherewith thou'st pierced the innumerous abodes Of slumbering mystery? What the Ithuriel spear, Which makes to thee in Truth's bright guise appear Things which to eyes ungifted shine not clear? How have those visions on thy soul descended? Yet, wherefore ask?âO'erpoweringly splendid!â Each glorifiedâimmortalizedâenrichedâ Now o'er thy canvass dazzlingly outstretched,â Burnsâinextinguishably wonderful!â With hues e'en Time shall teach not to grow dull. O! wherefore ask?âStill be it ours to admireâ To catch some sparks of thy Promethean fire! Still in unquestioning ecstasy to allay Our spirit-thirst with draughts of heavenly day! (For, still the immortal day-spring seems to bloom And break through all the intense, the gorgeous gloom, Which streams like midnight's jewelled mantle round Thy dream of worlds)âstill, still from the profound And teeming depths thou hast unveiled, to reap Gatherings of priceless knowledge, pure and deep, Thine must have beenâO! wherefore, wherefore ask?â Thine was an unparticipated task! The prophet-impulse of thine own winged thoughtâ The sole proud agency and aid thou hast sought! By thy unsuccoured strength hast thou achieved Thy kingly victories, and the crown received! That burning crown, that orbed and laurelled wreath, Which beams defiance to the shafts of Death! O! rich must be thy haunted solitudeâ Thy mind's creative, star-rejoining mood! What unimaginable apparitionsâ (Startling with dream-like, shadowy recognitions The soul of geniusâfor that soul sublime Hath lingering memories of its native clime!) What shapes of GloryâTerrorâWonderâPower, Must throng that incommunicable hour!â With aspects like the sun, or star-strewn sky! Beautiful!âbeautiful incomprehensibly! Though they be there whose foreheads, thunder-splintered, Shew where the ruinous bolts of wrath had entered! Behold them! Martin's Illustrations of Milton. rank o'er rank and grade o'er grade, The realmless lords! the discrowned chiefs! arrayed In mockery of the illustrious state they've lost! By thee evokedâthat myriad-legioned host! Behold him on his shadowing mountain-throne Amidst those vassal-myriadsâyet alone! How awfully alone!âmeet monarch there! Sovereignâin unapproachable despair!â He who, midst sceptered hierarchies divine, Did with insufferable refulgence shine! He, the Arch-anarch of the unbounded skiesâ Leader of ruined immortalities! But thou hast loftier, nobler, happier themes For the fine passion of thy mounting dreams! Pure heavenward hopes and crowned imaginations Incarnate seem midst thy more bright creations, Where angel-throngs, with wreath, and harp, and wing, O'er pictured Edens smiles of radiance fling. How must those glorious groupsâthose realms Elysianâ Crowd in dread pomp upon thy aching vision! Still, still surpassed by others still appearing, While, like Heaven's meteors dazzlingly careering, In long, interminably long, processionsâ In swift, precipitately swift, successionsâ They sweep through the endless area of thy thought, As by the wings of triumphing morning brought, Till, too intensely exquisite to stay, Those splendours melt, like sunset's clouds, away! Those shadowy-lengthening pageantries disperse Through all the avenues of the universeâ The universe of spirit and of mindâ All indestructible, though undefined! But still innumerable gleams and rays Remain and crowd upon thy raptured gaze! Shadows and scarce-glimpsed splendours flit and pass, As o'er the surface of some magic glass; And thou art skilled to embody and to blend Those ever-shifting phantasms without end! Thy whirlwind-stroke hath fixed them and enchained, And unto bright development constrained! And still adventurously hast thou essayed More wond'rous things!âmore wond'rously portrayed! And still undaunted and undazzled, still Thou'st climbed, and soared, and vanquished at thy will, And half-withdrawn the invulnerable veil, And almost stood within the extremest pale!â Loosened creation's adamantine zone, And glimpsed the blazing shadows of its Throne! Till e'en the Heaven of Heavens the Empyreums seem In the stupendous mystery of thy dream, Won from their dread inexorable height! Lo! thou'st drawn tribute from reluctant night, Amerced the lightnings on their arrowy flight, And prisoned themâand sentenced themâto flee, And burn, and dazzleâeverlastingly! In that suspended impulse of their power More terrible than in their chartered hour! Thou hast arrested even the ocean's surge, When stung to fury by the whirlwind's scourge! Seized the fierce tempest in its midmost rage, And dashed its sweeping terrors on thy page! Thou'st glassed the earthquake's desolating strife, When maddening, agonising into lifeâ Then levelled hills, and disembowelled plains, The earth and the elements appear! in chainsâ In viewless chains.âStrong arbiter!âthou'st swung The toppling crags! in mid-o'erwhelming hung!â In mid-o'erwhelming!âin the impending rushâ The threatening of the exterminating crush! Thou'st dreamed the ruin of the affrighted world; The heavens seem rent! the judgment-thunders hurled! Thou'st loosed the fountains of the eternal deeps, And forth the annihilating Deluge sweeps! Genius! thou day-star of the human mind! Which in its flight leaves systemed worlds behindâ Which streams through conquered universes, fraught With themes for the immortality of thoughtâ Thou'rt not to earth's inglorious span contracted, Nor incommunicatively abstracted!â From world to world thou tak'st thy trackless way, âWorld after world to unveil, and to display! Genius! thou'st bound all in thy kingly thrallâ Transpiercedâ constrainedâdefinedâunravelled all! Grandeur and Beauty thy deep soul pervade! Majesty is thy garmentâPower thy shade! All GrandeurâBeautyâMajestyâand Power, Are thy supreme, inalienable dower! The Past is refluent to thy mastering glance! âContemporaneous in thy breathless trance Art thou with all that hath been or shall beâ The Pastâthe Futureâand the Eternity! And, interpenetrated streams thy thought With all that e'er was to existence wroughtâ The incomprehensible, unmeasured Whole Seems compassed by thy circumambient soul! And glorifiedâilluminedâchangedâinspired, Where'er thou hast awakeningly respired! Thy breath is powerâlifeâvictoryârealization! Thy touchâthy lightning-touchâtransfiguration! Thy presenceâan apotheosis, even! Flooding the earth with sunburst hues of Heaven! TO THE MOON. World amongst worlds! the crowned, the girt with powerâ The minister of Nature's heavenliest hour, O, Moon, thou art! and still dost thou appear Calmly victorious o'er each vassal sphere! Thou lookest holyâpaleâseverely bright! Thou lovely Zion of the Heavens! while night, Beneath thy calm and solemnizing sway, Seems e'en more glorious than the orient day! Thou lovely Zion! throned 'midst thrones on high, City of shadowless transparency, Islanded in the blue untroubled sky! Ark of blest refuge, as perchance thou art, For earth's lost dovesâthey of the wounded heart! Shrine of the wandering thoughts! bright pillar'd tent! Heaven's landmark in the outstretched firmament! That archipelago of severed orbs, Whose beauty thrillsâelectrifiesâabsorbs The mindâwhich, triumphing or trembling, soars In passionate greeting from earth's pensive shores. But thou! 'tis to the heartâthe heart thou speakestâ 'Tis on the heart thy softening power thou wreakest! Breathing along itâtill 'tis winged with light, And fain to thee would shape its towering flight, Thou lovely Zion of the Heavens of night!â And now, while gazing on heav'n's seas of blue, The halcyon of one hope I faintly woo Unto my desolate and undreaming heart, Which hath beheld so many hopes depart, Like the light clouds which, soft-disporting, play, Then on the breeze that brought them float away !â The creatures of a moment! Such ye've beenâ But, ah! my hopesâmy life's once smiling scene, Hath, by your vanishing, been darkened o'er! Ye have stripped the hues its wide horizon wore; Ye've swept the flower-leaves from its stems borne down; Disturbed its doves of peaceâfar, far they've flown, And crushed the idols in its holds enshrin'd! And sad bequeathments have ye left behindâ Cold shadows, trailing o'er earth's loveliest things, And blights and poisons â chains, and taints, and stingsâ Echoes that murmuringly rise and roll, Troubling the precious music of the soul! Echoesâlike last notes of a dying bird, When on some bleak and gusty night they're heardâ The low, low harpings of a spirit blightedâ In its own wastes bewildered and benighted; While still the wind that calls the music forth Sighs from the past!âthe black and dreary north Of the long-disenchanted heart!âwhich grows Deadly unto itself, with cankering woes, And only to the touch that wounds it turnsâ And only with the flame that scathes it burns! And seeks alone the kindred things of grief To bind its shadowy wreath!âthe nightshade's leaf, The slumberous poppy, and the yew-bough chief! O, how the full-blown life, and full-blown pride Of the strong present, palls on hearts allied, By rivetted bonds, unto the long ago! And checks the sickening spirit's wayward glow, And seems a smile of mockery round to throw; While memory's pale and scattered leaves are driv'n Across our onward path! and, sweet as heaven, Pure spray-drops from the fountains of the past Fall on the fountains of life's lengthening wasteâ Making a melody all soft and wild; While with those Marah-waves,âyet undefiled,â They mix! then midst oblivion's keyless caves Freeze, petrify, or wasteâyet my heart craves E'en their brief freshness! since denied must be Hope's springs of jubilee and joyauncy! But are they sealed indeed against me now? While vainly throbs and aches this fevered brow? Sweet Hopes! delay! shine yet beyond the strifeâ Above the cold Asphaltes of my life! As stars o'er graves and deserts. Part not yetâ (Since all the lights of life, save ye, are set!) Part not!âAlas! ye're gone! bewild'ring dreams! While yet I feel your faintly-visioned gleams Now chillier than the moonlight glimpsing pale, O'er freezing snows that gird some alpine vale. Goneâgone! and, Parthian-like, they've turned and thrown Keen arrowsâthat remain, though they have flown! Like the Greek torch-race once seemed their career, On! on! Joy's quenchless torch they flew to bear. But let them go! O, there are promised joys, Impenetrable unto time's alloys! Joys that shall never fade, and never flyâ Meet for the children of eternity! And, looking on those midnight heavens that spread A wilderness of worlds above my head, Well may my heart in those proud hopes exult, And turn from dreams obscure, and thoughts occult, To that resplendentâthat soul-kindling blaze, That soul-bewilderingâthat o'erpowering maze, That everlasting and astounding pageâ (Defying withering time, age after age!) Where even the Holy Word seems stamped and streaming, Through worldsâdread worlds on fire!âfor ever beaming! And charactered in light along the sky! Ye stars! Probationers of the eternity! Persistent in unbroken harmony! Enlighteners and intelligencers meek, That all but breathe and smile â that more than speak! And thou, deep Moon!âthou spiritually intenseâ Thou loveliest shadow of Omnipotence! Ye do bring thoughts, and dreams, and hopes august, To lift the weeping mourner from the dust! The ambitious worldling from his tinselled toysâ The prodigal from his inglorious joys! The sufferer from the dim shades of the tomb, And even the sceptic from the depths of gloom! Shine on, thou wond'rous Moon! prevailing shineâ A powerâa taskâa mystery is thine! Thou seem'st too softly gentle to control These night-flowers, whose rich breathings sweetly roll On the faint breeze!â(all tremulously blushing! The heavy atmosphere around them flushing! Their coloured censers drooping towards the moss, Which rays illuminate and dews emboss)â Yet in thy fragile loveliness, calm Moon, Thou hast sway as regal as the lord of noon! O'er the deep world of waters thou dost reign, Binding the tides in thy elastic chain. Thou art their strength and trustâtheir life and soul, And still beneath thy silvery sway they roll; Thou art their crown and shieldâtheir light and guideâ From Heaven thou rulest their infuriate pride! O, that in my dark being set, some light From heavenâto heaven would guide my course arightâ Ruling my soul's deep waters midst the rushing night! THE RETURN. Art thou landed on thy native earth? Dost thou hear thy childhood's tongue? Art thou where thy mother blest thy birth, And o'er thy slumbers hung, In Infancy's enchanted years, When life and joy were oneâ When e'en the gush of transient tears, Like dews on flower-leaves shone? O! honoured be thy keen emotion, When thou hail'st this parent earthâ Leaving the breezy wastes of ocean, For thy proud land of birth! From what sweet region dost thou come? From what sun-province speeds thy prow? I care not! Thou returnest homeâ From whence it matters little now! It matters little from what shore, Since to thine own blest air and skyâ The cherished of the bosom's core, The land of home and memory! Though blue the heavens thou leav'st behind, And bright the fields of golden bloom, The poetry of heart and mind Sheds richer sun-gifts o'er our home! SONG. [Wouldst thou have this pale lip smile? but say] Wouldst thou have this pale lip smile? but say, And I will learn that lovely lore! Wouldst chase my shadowing gloom away? Behold, then, it is o'er! Wouldst thou have these thoughtful-drooping eyes Lit up by joy and glee? Wouldst have me banish tears and sighs? They shall be unknown things to me! Wouldst have my wild heart grow less warm? Chastened and meekly still, Thy word is still its master-charmâ 'Tis tempered to thy will. And if thou dost not yet approve me, Speakâspeak, I urgeâI pray thee! E'en if thou'dst have me cease to love thee, I'll die, and still obey thee! THE SUNBEAM. The sunbeam flashed upon a frost-work gemâ A tremulous water-drop straight met the eye! Scarce had it quivered on the lily's stem, Ere the same pitiless beam had drank it dry! And thus the heart, which in an earlier day Perchance was snow in all its unsunned pride, Once melted by wild passion's quenchless ray, Soon mourns its brightness dimmedâits fountains dried. ON MUSIC. No! nought beneath the sun is like to thee, Music! Of our deep souls the master-key! The passions kindled by thy sovereign might, Like mountain-torrents freed, in strength and light Stream on! and, deepened, purified, sublimed, Like exhalations that towards heaven have climbed! And in some spirit-crucible refined, Seem the vast sumless treasures of the mind! The feelings' glorious affluence, which too long May have lain chokedâsuppressed by grief or wrong, Then spreads around! by thee set free at onceâ And thoughts, rich thoughts, awake in deep response! When Night with her transcendent bird is reigning, Thou art, each sense, each wandering thought enchaining;â When Morning laughs in beauty, hark! oh, hark! Upspringing to the heavens loud sings the larkâ That music of the sun which seems to be Even like the sunrise-statue's melody, Brought forth from his own beams! Then joy swells high, In blameless daring to the beckoning sky! Then young Enthusiasm, revelling wild, Kindles his thousand altars undefiled; And Hope, the awakener, rapturously springs To the glad strength and freedom of his wings. Music! there is no bound to thy deep sway! Lo, on the combat's wild eventful day The warriors' hearts leap to thy proud appeal, And heave against the scarce-restraining steel. Through all the battle thunders dread and fierce, Thy sounds of billowy exultation pierceâ Thy notes have pierced, and ring triumphant out, Through the' echoes of the chargeâthe crashâ the shout! E'en through the stun of the artillery That shakes the dome of the retorting sky! The earth-pawing charger, maddening for the war, The regal music hears resounding far, And lives redoubled life through every nerve; Tossing his mane, shortening his neck's proud curve, While through his nostrils rolls the haughty breath, Thickening the sulphurous clouds whose rain is death! And glares his eye, on fire with furious wrath, And clangs his hoof along the echoing ground, Which with a moment's earthquake heaves around; The trumpet's ringing blast is in his earsâ The long, long roll of stormy drums he hearsâ And still he plunges on his desperate way, While toss the plumes around like ocean-sprayâ The faulchions, like forked lightnings on the watersâ The waters! Ah! the crimsoning sea of slaughters!â But let us turn to lovelier, happier scenes, Where summer heavens shine soft, and the heart leans To its more sweet, and dear, and calm emotions, Smoothed as the surface of eve's breezeless oceans! The maidens heap their stag-like heads with flowers, And weave the graceful dance through shadowing bowers; But one, the brightest of that radiant band, Smote by thy viewless and victorious wand, Droops her fair head upon a trembling hand. Thou hast pierced through her spirit! hast stirred up Thoughts that were lost in youth's o'erflowing cup, Thoughts of an absent dear one, who had been The day-spring glory of life's opening scene! Now hath thy strong and inly-working spell Compelled remembrance from its folded cell; At those dear recollected tones she starts, Those tones that wake but glee in lighter hearts, And sighing o'er the name she once loved best, Wooes tender memory to her softened breast; Hope languishes along each dying fall, And springs responsive to the sprightlier call; While memory throws her moonlight-rainbows round The brooding halcyon of the seas of sound! But when upon the poet's thrilling sense, Thou fling'st thy spell, imperious and intense, O, who shall tell what bright creations start Unto his throbbing brain and burning heart! His soul by thee is searched, winged, dowered, inspired! His keen imagination armed and fired, Till floats before his dream-enchanted eyes, Girt with all luminous mysteries of the skies, The mirage of a phantasm universe. Doth now his soul deliriously rehearse Its long eternitiesâin one dread flight!â One strong consuming burst!âone rush of might? Its long eternitiesâconstrained to sweep Into that moment's dizzying vortex deep! Doth now his mindâhis vast untrammelled mindâ To space, time, earth, creation, unconfinedâ Become the centre round which, thick converging, Suns and their systems roll! while still emerging, As from the' undreamed profundities of space New suns, new systems, join the immortal race? Doth his grand thought, of more than mortal power, Seem, in the strength of that prevailing hour, The very pivot round which eddying turn Careering spheres that tremble while they burn? The prism of all unfathomable hues!â âMirror, which but concentrates to diffuse! The focus of unimaginable fires! Load-star of all that, like itself, aspires!â While still outstretched before his conquering gaze, Worlds, myriad worlds, exulting sweep and blaze! Absolved from all distemperatures and gloomsâ (O! how unlike this world of tears and tombs!) Crowned with luxuriance of celestial light, Suffused with rainbow-colourings strangely bright, Breathing all precious summer's breathings roundâ O, but this dream of worlds hath neither bourne nor bound!â Peopled with beings glorious as the sun, When in the crimsoning east his reign's begun! Seraphic aspects, full of heaven and peace, Bright with unchanging bloom, and smiles that never cease! But when the last, last echoes murmuring roll, O'ershadowing consciousnesses blight his soul! That mighty mind hath rushingly retracked Its course, like a reverted cataract! A disenchanted desert spreads aroundâ Once more he treads the paths of mortal ground; He fain would grasp that passing, fading train, The phantasm of the Unbounded! but in vain! Yet during that proud respite, bright and brief, From care and strife, from memory and griefâ That deep, that full transfiguration-trance Of thoughts, whose sovereign predominance O'er-canopied the unlimited expanse!â How wondrously exalted, towered the soul Of genius! stretching on towards some far-off goal! How kindled was the o'erwrought imaginationâ Strengthened to grasp the arcana of creation! How gloriously surcharged the awakened mind, By riches in its unveiled depths enshrined! By flower, and leaf, and golden-fruited branch Of the high tree of knowledge! Launch, O, launch Thy mind's most royally-freighted argosy, Free poet! on the immeasurable sea Of shadowy speculation once again! Call back the gorgeous throngs, the astounding train, That haunted thee when music shook the air With piercing rapture, too intense to bear! Call back the glorying, rushing worlds of light, That blazed so keenly on thy inner sight, And chain them to thy proud triumphal car, Which th' unleashed lightnings, and the fire-tressed star, And th' eddying whirlwinds, shall bear wildly far! Arrest the unbounded phantasms ever fleeing! The unfathomable depths and gulphs of being With an unfathomable beauty fill! For, O, the Beautiful doth haunt thee still! O, be thy deathless, thy o'erwhelming feelings, Gathered in deathless strength to intense revealings! O, be thine unextinguishable thought With unextinguishable splendours fraught! Thy dreams, that far through space have shot away Into the unsufferable realms of day, With an excess of glory overpowered! O, with what dreams of heaven o'erwrought and dowered The poet's mind shall sovereignly be That dares to seize its birthrights and be free! His hour of keen reflection is an hour Girt with unknown, unutterable power! Ah! though his themes may breathe through burning words, Their heaven-born fire defies the lyre's frail chords! His passion-haunted solitude is rife Of marvels that seem teeming with deep lifeâ Of sceptered apparitions of the past, Or shadowings of the future, faintly cast Athwart his troubled spirit, faintly drawn, Like the unreal mockery of the eastern dawn, Ere yet the real dawn appears; but soon, Touched by his thought, they wear the hues of noon! His mind is lost 'midst its own wildering maze, Dazzled by many a startling, dizzying blaze Of phantasy too fervidly intense, And veiled by its own dread magnificence! His soul, o'erburthened by its own creations, Breathless with quickening, thronging inspirations, Mastered by visions that itself unveiled, Enthralled by mysteries that its thought hath scaled, Sinks into mighty stillness and repose, While still the fount of inspiration flows;â And still streams on with passionate persistance Through that soul's multitudinous existence! But loftier raptures yet the spirit await, Which music, wondrous music, can create; Nor in the grandly gifted mind alone, But whereso'er the seeds of faith are sown, When the organ's consecrated thunders swell Till every echo seems an oracle!â Midst the cathedral's massive-columned aisles, Old costly shrines, and trophy-sculptured piles, Where beats with raptured awe some lowly breastâ Ah! how its loftiest triumph is confessed! While chorused hallelujahs burst profound, As though a storm went by, and broke in sound, The music of the heavens it seems to be! Mighty to thunder-strike the immensity! Mighty to raise the spirit from the tomb, If 'twere, indeed, sepulchred midst its gloom! Mighty to uplift the living soul from earth, And pierce the shrouded secrets of its birth! To make those trophied shrines, those sculptured stones, Blaze like the threshold of the throne of thrones! Most mighty when the listener there shall kneel With heaven-touched heart that but aspires to feel! Then, then what fervid breathings swell that heartâ What echoes from its depths responsive start! Tempestuouslyâtempestuously they roll, While glorying exultations shake his soulâ Triumphs, and mysteries, and wonders, seem To haunt him, like the shadows of a dream; And rushing hopes, and towering aspirationsâ Raptures sublime, and breathless Adorationsâ And winged Enthusiasmsâpale as wo! Starry Transcendencies, that dazzling glowâ And visioned Super-eminencies divineâ These make his swelling soul their living shrine!â These have upon his deep-tranced thought descendedâ These, with his full-rejoicing spirit blended, Have compassed his existence! sunned his vision With radiant glimpsings of the realms Elysian! Thusâthus with loftiest raptures filled and fired, The lowliest breast shall be, by faith inspired!â With revelations of all marvels blessed, The humblest heart shall be, by faith possessed!â Rise!âthunderous hallelujahs! O ascend! The hollow firmaments transpiercing rend! Since ye can raise man's drooping soul above, Winged on a thought-electrifying love! Music! thou art a wondrous master-key To the great soul and her infinity! Ay, thou canst search the inner depthsâthe sealedâ The incommunicativeâunrevealed! Canst search, and stir them, too, with kindling strife, With agony, or ecstasy of life: Ah! e'en her depths of loveâthe undreamed, the unknown Even to herselfâare pierced by thee alone! O! Music, thou'rt a thrice-charmed master-key To the deep soul and her infinity! Unbounded is thy wide-asserted powerâ Thou crowdest ages in one passionate hour Of love or triumph! thou canst bring the past Even as a cloud upon a sweeping blast, With all its rushing darknessâwhence escapes A fearful throng of shadowy phantom shapesâ Whence startlingly and breathlessly arise Disturbing aspects, wan as twilight skies, And beautifulâe'en to fear and painfulness! The entombed! the lost! the loved, to all excess! But O! what unimaginable sway Must thine be, in the realms of boundless day! Where through the spirit-depths thou sweepest free, Thy language then no more a mysteryâ Where universe to universe shall call, Till all are bound in thy triumphant thrall! Where echo may no more thy reign extendâ No echo there, where there shall be no end To conquering harmonyâfor ever reigning! Bright orb to orb â nay, heaven to heaven enchaining! And spirit unto spirit!âthere shalt thou No longer through the obstructing senses plough Thy lingering way; but, with the soul! the soul! At once commingling, in full mastery roll! All sound shall there take thy entrancing tone, And silvery silence yield to thee alone! There shalt thou in thy jubilant career, Ne'er meet the passions that thou kindlest here. The dark conflicting passions that awake Beneath thy pure, pure spell, and dare to slake At thy rich fountains their unholy thirstâ At thy rich fountains, that untainted burstâ Breathing of too profound, intense a bliss To be sustained in such a life as this! SOON, SOON SHALL MY TOILING BARK. Soon, soon shall my toiling bark touch on the shore, Where the desolate heart shall be blest; Where the surge of this long-troubling ocean no more Shall deprive the worn spirit of rest. Where no care for the past, and no fear for the morrow, Shall oppress earth's tired wanderersâwelcomed, forgivenâ Where the bark that hath rode through the dim waves of sorrow Shall be anchored sublimely on shadowless heaven. On! on! my frail bark, through the surge and the sprayâ There's a beacon that beckons and leads from afar: On! on! my weak bark, through thy perilous wayâ There's above thee a heaven! and before thee a star! THE SEA-SHORE. I strayed on the shore at that dear hour of even, When the waters are wooed by the sighing night-breeze;â When the calm stars had met in the dark-azured heaven, And the moon scattered beauty and light o'er the seas. Allâall was so silent and slumberous aroundâ In such breathless repose all the scene seemed to lieâ Even the waves shorewards rolled with a low dreamy sound, And disputed with Echo her tremulous sigh. O! 'tis balm to the spiritsâ'tis bliss to the soul, Such a moment of solitude, rest, and delight; While the blue waves in tranquil sublimity roll, And beauteously awful grow heaven and the night! THE WINTER ROSE. O! true love is a winter rose, Smiling beneath a frowning sky, Pillowed on dreary frosts and snows, While patient hope stands guardian by. Yes! true love is a winter rose, Watered by tears and fanned by sighs; And soft it blooms, and fair it blows, While storms unheeded round it rise. Yet, if it is a winter rose, The native of dismaying climesâ When in its full-blown pride it glows, It makes all hours sweet summer primes. SONG OF THE ECHOES.FIRST ECHO. I loveâO! how I love to dwell On the glorious harp's resounding swell! In the eddying whirl of the torrent lostâ On the billowy sweep of the music tossed; Yet from tone to tone still hurring on To a lovelier and a lovelier one! Till at lastâ'tis o'erâand but I am left, Of the breath of my airy being bereft; But, O, while floats the expiring fall, 'Tis I give the loveliest tone of all! Where the low-voiced flutes, all silvery soft, A breath of soul seem to wake and waft!â Where the mountain-horn rings wildly sweet, More soft and wild I the sounds repeat! Where the glorious and triumphant lyre Thrills with the poet's dreams of fire,â Whose chords, even mighty the soul to upbear, With a passion of melody shake the airâ There, there I am not of the things that die, But my breath is an immortality!SECOND ECHO. On the lover's farewell I faintly live, And give it more sweetness than memory may give; And I sink away through the maiden's heart, And never more, never more, may we part! I float on the breeze that blows from shoreâ I hang round the stroke of the parting oarâ On the swan's death-chaunt I brood and dwellâ O'er the broken luteâon the funeral bellâ On the rustling leaves of the autumnal hoardsâ On all farewell murmurs, and all last words! I reign in the long-deserted hall, Where banners shake to the winds on the wall: The fanes of the olden gods are mineâ Last oracle of each ruined shrine! And proudly I roll midst cathedral-aisles, When the requiem swells up through the trophy-piles, And sadly where virgin-voices soft A hymn of death through dim cloisters waft!THIRD ECHO. My dwelling is 'mongst the enchanted woods, Midst the glad rejoicings of founts and floodsâ Where thousands and thousands of bright birds float, And I soar away on each quivering note; And deep with the shining pearls I dwell In the rosy windings of ocean's shell, Whence I pour such sweet and resistless tones, That even the deep their enchantment owns! And, O! I have lovely cells and domesâ All, all my own!âmidst the heathery blooms, That spread where the mountain-springs have birth, And the mountain-eagle soars up from earth! Where the stag leaps free, and the fern waves high, Have I caverned dwellings of secrecy! Midst the shadowy grass and the flower's deep bells Have I hidden haunts and unrecked of cells! Where the fountainsâthe chainless fountainsâplay, And the bee makes his tune through the long, long dayâ Where the primrose-tufts have a dewy gleam, That seems caught from the vesper star's last beamâ Where the trembling reeds make answer low To the winds that fitfully come and goâ Where the murmuring depths of the woods profound Send up a solemn and dreamy sound!â O! there I have many a joyous home, And many a hollowed and covered dome!FOURTH ECHO. Where the warrior's charge in the pealing strifeâ Where the ground drinks the purple flood of lifeâ Where the princely crest is cloven and shattered, The breastplates are shivered, the banners are scatteredâ Where the war-horse is trampling and raging in might, And wild are the sounds of the charge and the flight! There, there 'tis my pride and my joy to beâ There, there hold I ever my revelry! Midst the brattling of falchions, the crashing of spears, The leader's loud shouts, and the host's stormy cheers! I haunt the thunder-clouds night and dayâ With their sounds of terror sport and play. Near the hissing volcano I take my rest, And downwards I roll on the lauwine's Lauwineâthe avalanche. breast; Where the forest, fierce rocked by the tempest, roarsâ Where the sea, in its might, heaves the groaning shoresâ There, there, hold I ever my revelryâ There, there 'tis my pride and my joy to be!FIFTH ECHO. By the couch, the blest couch, of the early dying, When the spirit is fluttering and all but flying, I linger! And, O! how the encircling air Is brightened with angel-presences there! While angel-whisperings float and thrill, With mysterious sweetnesses burdened still; And I sink awayâfor the world of sound Is swept by a harmony too profound! There seem blessed sighs of fervour stealing, And melodies of holiest feeling; And thence half-sighing and half-singing, Still heavenwardsâheavenwards upspringing, I arise, and take at last my flight, Even in that freed soul's train of light! Till, O! I haunt the Elysian airâ The spirit of an echo there! FAREWELL. O would I might awhile forget A grief I may not tell! My being's sun is quenchedânot set: Farewell! I have a region all mine ownâ The calm of hill and dell! Where sorrowing breezes sweetly moan Farewell! And though red Summer will intrude Her smiles upon my leafy cell, Summer must sigh to vale and wood, Farewell! But memory, I abjure thy power, Hushed be thy muttered knellâ Razed from my thoughts be each past hourâ Farewell! Oblivion and indifference Calm my heart's wave-like swell! To love, to hope, to keen suspenseâ Farewell! Indifference and oblivionâ Bind my heart's broken shell! The awakeners of the soul are gone!â To allâFarewell! AN OLD HAUNT. It was a dreamy haunt! And, O, the times, In spring's young hours and summer's roseate primes, That I have wandered there, in hope and joy, In thoughtless idlesseâpeace, without alloy! But now a breeze of change hath o'er it blown,â Ah! 'tis the shadows of the heart are thrown Along its changeless beautyâstill the same As when that heart deemed sorrow but a name! Thou lark! thou'rt soaring, singing, as of old, Rejoicing ever with delight untold, And hanging on the morning's cloudless brow, Like a bright quivering forehead-jewel now! I almost marvel in so dear a spot The paradise of sky is not forgot! Ah! midst those isles of cloud, can'st thou ere find A happier home than that thou leavest behind? Ye winds, that leave no hidden nook unsearchedâ That play in scorn where eagles never perched Nor pierced!âthat rifle, in your mirth, All the green treasure-holds of laughing earth; Sayâhave ye e'er o'erswept a lovelier scene, Or on a track more full of beauty been? And clouds! ye star associates! declare, Have ye e'er visited a haunt so fair?â Hath e'er the all-viewing sun himself descried A sweeter, midst his subject-regions wide? Hath ever night a heavenlier spot o'erpowered, Midst leafy glooms embosomed and embowered? How fitlyâwhen no sound its stillness mars, Glassed over by the dewy light of stars, Sweet isle! as 'mongst the sea-like woods, thou art Of refuge and repose to this worn heart. Green bowery shrine! at which the sad might kneel, Forgetting how to mournâbut, ah! not how to feel! LINES TO A BOWER. Once more I visit thee, my bower; Nor dream of grandeur, fame, nor power! Calm haunt of innocence and ease, When tired of sounds of heartless mirthâ When tired of all besides on earthâ Thou can'st not cease to please! Sing, sing! thou unseen joyous bird; Thy gladdening note I oft have heard! Sweet herald of the hastening spring; My heart as light, and spirits gay, As thine, wild songster on the spray, That doth so blithely, loudly sing. Blow, flowerets, blow! around my bower, Refreshed by many a silvery shower! Still flourish here, thou lily paleâ Carnation bright, and blooming rose! Here, too, the honeysuckle blows, And scents the fresh and balmy gale. My much-lovedâmy unaltered bower, Bespangled o'er by leaf and flower! 'Tis here that I delight to rest!â Hereâhid from every mortal eye, Unmarked by stranger passing byâ No sorrows heave my breast! Not yon proud castle's scutcheoned wallsâ Fair terraces and bannered halls! Not sculptured stone, nor cloud-capt tower, Can yield my heart such dear delight, Nor even captivate my sight, Like thee, my solitary bower! MY HOPE. My hope hath ever streamed a meteor bright, A sunshine-glimpseâa mirage of delightâ A star soon bosomed in a cloudy night: Such is my hope! It shifts and shines a brightly-troubled dream, A rainbow's aÃ«ry woofâa glowworm's gleamâ A sun-set cloud, with varying hue and beam: Such is my hope! Fragile as that light cloud's fantastic formâ Soon changed when summer-heavens, serene and warm, Are darkened by the sudden gathering storm: Such is my hope! A phantasm of enchantments bright and frail, A flower-scent borne along a sweeping gale, The music of a dying nightingale: Thus ends my hope! But hark! what rapturous notes resounding ring! It is the lark upon his fearless wing!â With him from earth to heaven exulting spring, My hopeâand conquer! THE SEASON COMES. The season comesâthat season fair, When blossoms crown the silvery thorn; When music streams along the air, And sun-gifts on each breeze are borne! The stars shine through serenest skies, The heavens drop precious tears; The fair trees wear a thousand dyes,â 'Tis May! blest May! appears. Forget thy sorrows, child of earthâ Behold the scene around! Observe the fearless buds put forth, And beautify the ground! Light as the spray that leaves the sea, The jasmine's wreaths of stars are twining, And gossamer on yon dark tree, Like fairy-webs, is clearly shining. I sat within the bower I love, Where waveless waters glide along, And listened to the murmuring dove, And to the blackbird's blither song. My bower is sweet! my bower is fair! Far from the world's tempestuous sea; 'Tis there I breathe the freshest air, And rest beneath the greenest tree. O, Solitude! to me how dear! Thouâthou canst soothe my weary sightâ Canst hush the sighâcanst check the tear, With dreamings of divine delight. Ye halls, where festal pomps aboundâ Where sounds the harp's melodious swellâ Where pleasure waves her wand around, I cannot love ye half so well! And if, while float the harp's rich sighs, And shines the lamped and tapestried wall, Memories of green sweet fields arise, I cannot love ye then at all. Or should one thought of my calm bower, Embosomed in the tranquil glen, Strike my wild heart in such an hour, I hateâO, how I hate ye then! NIGHT. A thousand thousand worlds break forth in light, Till the mid-heavens seem streaming on our sightâ Moreâmore than the mid-heavensâthere seems to dwell, Deep midst their splendours inaccessible, A presence and a power!âdivine!âsupreme! And yetânot soâ'tis but a cheating dream! 'Tis but the shadow of a presence there, Reflected back from the out-stretched soul! They bear, Even in the might of their refulgent hour, But the dread impress of invisible power. Beautiful, Night, thou art! High mysteries breathe Through all thy conquering silenceâdeep as death; High mysteries that seem portion still and part Of the high nature throbbing through the heart! Thy sky seems wearing, midst its depths of blue, The intense transparence of the sapphire's hue! The piercing sweetness of Eolian sighs, The burning darkness of the hyacinth's dyes, Dwells on thy thrilling air! while whisperings low Fitfully through thine awful regions flow! Not now art thou by tempests lashed and tossed, But in thine own unbounded beauty lost! O, how unbounded! Not a breathâa ray, But floats through starry endlessness away! I've watched thee, when along the shaken shores Thy haughty presence like a deluge pours! When kingly storms met ye with furious force, And savage winds raved hurriedly and hoarseâ When with the hollow-dashing breakers' din The gathered surge, the hissing surf chimed in, And the fierce waters leaped and roared around, As scorning every chain, and every bound! When the deep heaved and rushed, as though 'twould rock, With every thundering burst and conquering shock, The mighty heavens themselves on its dread wavesâ Those shadowy, incommunicative graves Of countless thousands, whose strewn ashes stir Within their loud and jubilant sepulchre!â But now, the lovely difference!â'tis an hour When thoughtsâdreamsâprayers, assert a sevenfold power, The stars, like pageant-visions, float and gleam, And seem to bear on every quivering beam A load of life-like beautyâa rich store Of strange, magnificently-wondrous lore! As from each ray, all tremulously gleaming, The poetry of eternity was streaming! Pressing our souls, a weight of breathless light Comes silent down, unfathomably bright! Still there pass breezy whispers through the air, So sweetâso faintâas dying love were there; Till memoryâpassionâconscience, swell the tone, And trumpet-like peals each mysterious moan. O, 'tis a strong hour this!âthe mind soars high, To which the winds are laggards in the sky. The all-o'ersweeping mind that rends its way Beyond the chartered bounds of night and day! Through the awed soul, heavenâheaven now seems to rush, Yet not consumed, as sank the burning bush Of old, but hallowed, chastened, glorified, And melted from its pinnacle of pride!â That soul, in rapt communion filled and fired, Is thrillingly awakened and inspired! Still, still the old religious night o'erpowers With holiest thoughts the dark stream of her hours, As she would fain man's questioning spirit draw O'er her abyss of beauty and of awe. But, O, dread, fearful being that thou art! Man of the dark unfathomable heart, How often dost thou turn in scorn away, Impatient of thy better nature's sway! Thou'st pierced the secrets, wonderful and old, Of nature, and her chasmy page unrolled; Sounded creation's depths,âthy own strong will The agent of thy grand achievements still! But what, save Heaven's omnipotence, can sound Thy spirit's sea of darkening depths profound? Yet, through thy vast existence there is nought So fearfully distracting to the thought As thy soul's deadness to its own true lifeâ Its strenuous eagerness in each vain strife For earth's vain triumphs! its harsh disrespect Of heavenly things! Alas, its cold neglect! Are nature's threateningsâteachingsâpromptings, vain? Still hopelessly beleaguering heart and brain! Shall narrow self be ignobly opposed To worlds developed and to heavens disclosed? Shall nought, or touch, or pierce that stony heart, In dreadful independence reared apart? Shall nought arouse, convince that slumbering mind, In the uncommunicativeness enshrined Of self-sufficing, deaf, and reckless pride, With all presumption's impious host allied!â Must all be vain?âthe unutterable all Which should the stubbornest thought enchainâenthrall! The Eternity's sublime attesting signsâ The Immensity's ten thousand thousand shrines, Setting all space on fire! Those worlds whose strife Harmonious, floods the firmaments with life! Nature's most rich revealings! pure and high, And blazoned forth through the earth, and air, and sky! While, O, through worlds and wastes of worlds, through space, Through allâthat all extension doth embrace! The heights, the depths, the expanses, and the abysses, The ocean-gulphs, and chaos-wildernesses!â Through calm and storm, the earth-wakening thundercrash! The arrowy terrors of the lightning's flash!â Through morning's rich luxuriance of delightâ Through midnight-heavensâthrough all the crush of night!â Through every moment of out-meted time, Which strikes its own death-knell in every chime! (Time! that still flies!âthat hath for ever fled! As from that awful contact, deep and dread)â Through every element that hath confessed The unerring laws, fulfilled the imposed behestâ Through every sun that takes its glorying way, Scattering profuse magnificence of dayâ Through every beam that star or sun emitsâ Through all the infinite of infinitesâ The Godhead breathes! the eternal Godhead streams! The Almighty presence pours! and clouds, and beamsâ Thunders and lightningsânoon and midnight, still Beneath the burthening Omnipresence thrill! OmnipotenceâOmnipotence proclaims Itself through all!âO! shame of burning shames! Shall we, in obdurate pride, refuse to hear The Almighty voice, that thrills each echoing sphere?â Thundering through long-resounding worlds on high, Till all are love, and strength, and harmonyâ Thundering, to melt away from those proud thrones, Into the murmurous hush of tenderest tonesâ Sunk to that still small voice, whose whisperings low, Poured in faint cadence, tremulously flow, When through the human breast its breath is stealing, Tenderlyânayâimploringly appealing! As if thus softened from a pitying fear Of startling man's awed soul!âand shall that soul not hear? And shall the love of Heaven, a wounded love For ever be? The Heaven of Heavens above Opened their dazzling gates of glory wide, (While wonder-stricken angels turned aside, Bowed with amazement!) for the atoner's train! His train! Ah! he who doth omnific reign O'er worlds by myriads, on the eternal throne, Went forthâto grief, scorn, anguish, deathâalone! And vain! all vain! That more than mightiest love Streamed through the astonished Heaven of Heavens above, But to be lost in man's disdainlful heartâ That doth not shrink nor quailâthat doth not start! Untouched by all that should to each pierced thought Bring adoration, even to anguish wrought! Alas! shall no compunctious pang be broughtâ Alas! shall no spark from the Almighty Sun Kindle the soul from doom and darkness won? No gracious breathings of the Almighty Doveâ Whose breathings all are mercy, pardon, loveâ Melt the stern spirit from its hardened pride,â Nor from the paths of sin triumphant guide? Must there be truth in such abhorrent tale? O, stars! ere ye're absolved, wane, dim and paleâ To undiscoverable depths retire! Turn from this guilt-stained earth your looks of fire, Or, in o'erwhelming mountainous, conspiring, Rend through the scattered elements expiring Your dread avenging path! Expelâefface The world of death from the abyss of space! Your glory, indestructibleâdivine, Withdraw from this contaminated shrine! Your harmony, multitudinous and deep, Waste not upon this cold world's deafened sleep! Leave the bared midnight heavens like some rent scroll, In dread similitude of man's dimmed soul!â Even to the blackness of their darkness dire.â Vainly they've rolled their breathless seas of fire! Vainly, o'er-charactered with truths sublime, Given their bright banners to the storm of time! O, vainly have they wielded, night on night, Worlds linked with worldsâspheres joined with spheres of lightâ Stupendous chain-shot, 'gainst man's stubborn brain, In luxury of endeavour, vainâall vain! Let it not beâat least one heart awake! Let mine its clayey trammels from it shake! Let life be love!âeven love that never dies, Borne o'er earth's glooms, temptations, agonies! (As the sea-eagle o'er the sweeping main, That soars beyond the reach of speck or stain,) To where the passion-tempests cease from strife, And all is bound in full deep burning life!â Beautiful, Night, thou art!âmost beautiful When thy adoring stillness seems to lull The spirit! yet but breathes intenser power Through every thought, born in thy solemn hour! O, 'tis a draught of passionate repose, That from thy unsealed fountains deeply flows Into that fevered spiritâfreshening all Its fainting powers, that hallowed dew doth fall! The soul is haunted by transcendant dreamsâ Unlanguageable hopes! quick spirit-gleams, That scarce may seem its own, but sent in love From the most glorious of the worlds aboveâ Precipitated rays, concentred bright Into one sun of deep-embosomed light! No wishes wild the imagination forms, Heaving with billowy might, like prisoned storms! No cold regrets round memory's altars cling, Making them dim sepulchral urns! Each spring Of feeling trembles into joy! O, Night! Even now I bless thy solemnizing mightâ Even fancies free, that wildly gushed of yore Their bright meanderings labyrinthine o'er, Have sunk into one deep and silent streamâ Calm confluence of many a wandering dream! Beautiful, Night, thou art! thy pomp of gloom Is richer than the day-spring's living bloom! Majesty is thy awful soul! thy breath Is strong as storm, and deep as deepest death! Beautiful, Night, thou art! no leafâno flower, But wins from thee a trebly-precious dower, To charmâto soothe the o'erwrought unquiet feelings To administer the calm of tenderest healings, E'en to the wounded spirit, though its wo Be of that sort which doth in silence flow! Beautiful art thou! on the mountains' heights, Which seem to mingle with thy deathless lights! Beautiful on the breezy purple sea, Which only bends, and only yields to thee! And midst the forest's verdurous solitudes, Th'unroofed cathedrals of the solemn woods! And o'er the palm-crowned desert's loneliest breast, Or wide savannahs of the mighty west! And now to meâtoo beautiful thou appearestâ Too deep, too dread a loveliness thou wearest! My dreams are girt by shadows too profound, And round my heart too many chains are wound! Quick tears are swelling in mine upraised eyesâ All vainly questioning thy untroubled skies, Of things that still must beâthy mysteries! Vain yearnings start within my trembling soul! Ye stars! that in immortal triumph roll, Bear me to peace away! Night, let me part! Invulnerably beautiful that thou art, Close not around my spiritâfain 'twould rise In free upspringings through thy trackless skies! WHEN THE EARTH'S OVERSHADOWED. When the earth's overshadowed by cloud and by gloom, And the tempests burst forth, black as death from their tombâ When the pine-forests crash to the storm-gusts, and roar,â When the loud breakers dash 'gainst the rock-crested shore! When the sounds of the night are of terror and might, And the wild ocean-eagle sweeps past in his flightâ When thunders and darkness are rolling and heaving, And through midnight the lightnings are fitfully cleaving! Then my heart is possessed By a rapture of rest!â Then break, as by magic, the harsh heavy links, From whose grinding and crushing my worn spirit shrinks! The links of that chain, ever mouldering and maddening The heart of my youth! and surrounding and saddening All bright mortal objects vouchsafed to my view, Till its rust even poisons life's healthfullest dew! That earth-chain that lies like a huge snake entwined Midst the heart's wreathing tendrilsâthe chords of the mind! But when thunders are gathering and threatening aroundâ When, like giants, the elements wrestle unboundâ Then my soul is oppressed With a grandeur of rest! And yet not oppressedâfor the energies froze In the gloom of a torpor that was not repose; And 'tis life and 'tis ecstasy then to be blest With a conscious, a breathing, a triumphing rest! Then the feelings that long have despaired and succumbed No longer are silencedâno longer benumbed! But, strengthened and heightenedâunbosomed and brightenedâ From a dungeon's gloom freed!âof a mountain's weight lightenedâ Sweep forth, like a torrent of billows that force Through the floodgates that pent them their jubilant course; And I wake from my dim dream of trouble and care, To find life may be lovely, and nature be fair! O! those storms seem to me like outpourings of loveâ But the outspreading of thy brooding wings, heavenly Dove!â Since there never yet raged so terrific a storm But dim outlinesâfaint shadowings, of that mighty form Seem glimpsed through the lightningsâimpressed on the gloomâ Like that bright angel-presence of old by the tomb! Thou would'st seem, dread Omnipotence! never more nigh Than when mercy and power burst at once from the sky! Ah! the dreariest storm is but harbinger dark Of that still-smiling bow that smiled over the ark! Then, ye tempests!âappointed, and measured, and weighed, O'erwhelm the wide earth with your gloom and your shade! Let my soul be compressed In magnificent rest! THE BLIGHTED ROSE. Shall there descend no silvery shower Thy sweetness to restore? Alas! poor withered, altered flower, Thou'lt bloom and smile no more! O! shall there fall no gentle dew To bathe that drooping head? I spake! but the chilly north-wind blew, And the flower lay pale and dead! O! it never blushed nor bloomed again, Though the nightingale sang its softest song; O! the nightingale's song and my care was vainâ It shone no more amongst the rosy throng! But the night-bird found another flower, And I a thousand full as bright! Thus perishes, in one winged hour, A thing of loveliness and light! Yes! thus the things earth, smiling, yields, Pass!âpass! forgotten, though so fair! But we inherit heaven's pure fields, Transplantedâwelcomedâcherished there! I WEEP THE HOUR. I weep the hour when I was born, Since thou canst find it joy to grieve me; Yet, even if I've deserved this scorn, Forgive meâO, forgive me! I but desired thy faith to prove, To try if thou'dst the heart to leave me; I only wished to try thy loveâ Forgive meâO, forgive me! Let peace and rosy joy returnâ Ah! spurn not thus the flowers I weave thee; By day I weep, by night I mournâ Forgive meâO, forgive me! And must this prayer be prayed in vain? Wilt thou not pity nor believe me? My heart dies for that smile againâ Forgive meâO, forgive me! O! of that smile's sweet rosy ray Wilt thou for evermore bereave me? While still, with choking sobs, I pray, Forgive meâO, forgive me! If thou wert wanâif thou wert sadâ I'd give my life-blood to revive thee; O say! my breaking heart to gladâ I doâI do forgive thee! THE CONSOLATIONS OF NATURE. Twas morning!âthe spirits of stars seemed bequeathed To the pure glistening flowers, that sultrily breathed Their fragrant enchantments above and around, And even coloured the air as they brightened the ground. By the blue rolling waters I silently strayed, For my heart was o'erwhelmed by grief's silence and shade! But my comfortless bosom reaped comfort unsoughtâ Rainbows sprang from my tears! 'twas heaven's hues that they caught! I heard a sweet voice in the breeze that was blowing; It whisperedâYield not to unholy despair! I perceived something bright in the waters blue flowing; It cheated my heart of its burthening care. I felt the soft dews when the twilight was fading, They freshened my feelingsâassuaged my sick fears! I touched the rich leaves 'mongst the wreaths I was braidingâ That dewy touch softenedâsuppressed my dark tears; For, O, if those fragile and beautiful flowers Are fostered and nourished by sunshine and showers, And that blue rolling streamlet's preserved in its course, As stainless and pure as it rose at its sourceâ All undimmed as the diamond, deepâdeep in the mine, Or the pure precious pearl in its far-hidden shrineâ And the breezes and dews evermore are renewed, And the wide earth with blessings and marvels is strewed, And all, all beneath heaven claims Heaven's exquisite careâ The heirs of that heaven should ne'er yield to despair! OSMAN TO ZELIDA. O! breathe those thrilling sounds once more, Floating along the winds of even; While the blue bright waves just kiss the shore, Then melt as twilight melts from heaven. Sweep, sweep the deep chords of thy lute, And stir its witching melodies! And while all else lies asleep and mute, Faint echo shall shape her low replies! Yes, echo and my throbbing heart Shall catch each cadence of thy strain; And when the last soft sounds depart, Shall dieâtill they revive again! 'Tis sweet on the moonlighted shore, When all is charmed into deep repose, Save the lute and the voice I so much adore, And perchance the bulbul's song to the rose! My Zelida! diamonds may clasp thy zone, And roses be wreathed in thy braided hair! But, Zelida, all who behold thee shall own That thine eye is more bright, and thy cheek more fair. That eye is as dark as the depths of night, When they hang o'er the clouded and troubled waters; But thy smile! 'tis a heaven of shadowless light, Thou fairest of Franguestan's fair daughters! And Osman is blestâhow triumphantly blest, Since his fate is linked, beloved, with thine! Ere to-morrow's sun shall sink in the west, My treasureâmy birdâshall for ever be mine. The descendant of despots! the son of a slaveâ Would sigh to possess theeâand vainly should sigh! Earth's monarchs might envy yon little white wave, Which creeps to my Zelida's feet but to die! But thou must be mine, and mine alone; Far, far from thy soul be ambition and prideâ Not even to the heir of old Stamboul's throne Would Osman resign his all-beautiful bride! Then, O, on the breezy and moonlighted shore, Breathe the music of passion, the language of soul! While the stars beam on beam of soft radiancies pour, And amidst their blue darkness the sleepy waves roll! O, those stars, they are lovelyâthose waves darkly bright; Yet I look not to them, but to theeâonly thee! For thine eye dazzles deeper! thy cheek wears a light That makes pallid and dim all besides that we see! Then sweep thy soft luteâno Zenana is this! The free skies are above theeâthe wide shore aroundâ The billows seem murmuring low, as in bliss, While the air seems oppressed by a hush too profound! THE STARRY SKIES. Ye flaming watch-towers of the solemn skiesâ Ye haughty, unabsconding mysteries! Manifestations beautiful and pure, âBearing a dread and awful signature!â Of mightiest Truths that shall for aye endure! How gloriously unfolds each world above! Ministrant of sweet terror, deepest love And joy, but solemn joy, unto the heart, Which, 'neath those radiant inquisitions, well may start, With conscious horror at its load of sin, From those rich worlds without to worlds withinâ Of cloud and gloom, all tremulously turning: O, that those inner worlds were deeply burning With fervid purities as richly fraught! O, that such rays streamed round each wakening thought! Stars! in all pomp, all beauteous pomp arrayed, Regalia of the universe displayed! Stars! glorying in your harmony sublimeâ Dazzling chronometers of missioned time; Burning with adoration's dread excessâ Ruffled as by o'erpowering happiness! Ethereal principalitiesâcrowned powersâ With empire girtâenriched with sovereign dowers! How ye inflame the conscious mind that feels The o'erwhelming truths your startling pomp reveals! Your's is a light that smites, but doth not blind, Ye gracious Mediators of the Mind!â Which, taught by ye, may dare at last to raise To loftier wonders its triumphant gazeâ Wondersâto thunderstrike the soul with dread, If unprepared and unpremonished! Ye mighty fountains of unfathomed fire, That ever blaze, and quicken, and aspire! Ye unexhausted, unimpoverished minesâ Magnificently glorious thrones and shrines! O, unextinguishably beauteous lights, Girt with sweet powers to brunt all years and blightsâ All timesâall seasons! Ever pure and high,â Breathing around your immortality! How doth the spirit spurn its bonds of clay Beneath your calm regenerative sway! How glorious are ye to our soul and sight! Your lovely strength exerted o'er the night All unlaboriouslyâyour splendours deep Showered round, like gleams 'mid phantom-haunted sleep! Ye paragons of glory undefiledâ Marvels on marvels crowded, heaped, and piled; Familiarities, miraculously strangeâ Imperishable challengers of change! Ye voiceless champions of eternityâ Great commonwealth of worlds that throng the sky! Would that your majesty of calm repose Were glassed upon this world of stormy woes! Enduring and exulting orbs! proud arks For soaring spiritsâpure electric sparks, That quicken into beauty all the vast, The unsounded deep of heaven! the effulgent waste! Ye shall not faulter in your task, nor fail, Nor wavering burn, nor languish dim and pale! Ever persistent intimations ye, Of bliss and glory and futurityâ Of boundless powerâunmeasured might aboveâ Unfluctuating, unfathomable love! For love, through all creation's vast expanse, Breathes out in manifest predominance! Then shine! like wakeful guardian-seraphs, shine! The heart to inspire, to exalt, and to refine! Blaze, then, like quenchless watch-fires, ever blaze. The soul to awake, to animate, to raise! Of the most infinite sea, ye gorgeous shellsâ Mute monitorsâunbreathing oracles, From our stupendous nature calling out Rich melodies of hope, unchecked by doubtâ For who can doubt, when truth is writ in light Ineffably, unutterably bright? For who can doubt when blazing worlds proclaim The great reality in storms of flame? And nobly ye proclaim it to the sense And soul in dizzying magnificence! Ye! whom no stain, no blight, no shadow mars, Unborn, undying, immemorial stars! Calm zealots!âbright incomprehensibles!â Explicit mysteries!âluminous signs and spells!â Placid dictators of the solemn skiesâ Unboastful, pure infallibilities! Beauteous predominancies! thrones of light! Heaven's glorying super-eminencies bright! Ye are indeed the very prisms and mirrors Of the endless universe! Ye radiant terrors Unveiled, but all unfathomable still! O, weak is scienceâvain is human skill, To trace your wonders! In your skyey home, Far from the enfolding shadows of the tomb, Perchance our strengthened thought and unsheathed glance May fathom and transpierce you! There perchance We may unravel and develope all Your mystery, awful and majestical! But now our minds bewilderingly conceive, And even in triumph painfully perceive!â And strenuously, laboriously must learn, Feebly discover, arduously discern, That little which may only guide us wrong! O, wiser, wiser is the seraph's song Than all the cherubs' dread and awful lore! 'Tis grand to know, 'tis heavenly to adore! O, let us wing our souls with holy love, If we indeed would strongly soar above! Roll on, proud hierarchs of the midnight heaven, To you a thousand thousand spells are given; And gazing, pondering on your maze and plan, Glorious compeers of this dim world of man! The very soul seems bowedâenthralledâtransfixed, With exultation and despondence mixed!â Despondence that its home should still be far, And exultation that beyond each star, Each sun that paves the immeasurable abyss, That home awaits it, midst the worlds of bliss! Well may it cherish, e'en thus cooped in clay, A reverential hope, which not astray Shall lead the inspired heart! No! on the track Of deathless truthâon pinions never slack, It shall ascend e'en eagle-like on high, To bathe in all the fountains of the sky! WISHES. Wild, stormy spirit! would'st that thou Wert cold and tranquil as my brow! Unquenched, unquenchable thou art, And kindled by a burning heart. O for a draught of Lethe's stream! O for a child's long happy dream! For tearsâdeep tears, that might efface From my dark soul bleak sorrow's trace! Or for a dreamless, breathless rest!â Calm as the cloud-worlds of the west; Like them at last to melt away, Surviving not the golden day! Or for a mind of loftier powers, To struggle with these earth-bound hours! For thoughts like sun-birds, that would rush Where sunshine-fountains leap and gush! Yet, wherefore wish!â'tis weak, 'tis vain, 'Tis sin, and vanity, and pain: O pray alone to be forgivenâ Leave, leave the rest, my soul, to Heaven! SONG. [Tell me, hath thy young heart ne'er yearned] Tell me, hath thy young heart ne'er yearned Through lengthened hours we've passed apart? Tell me, hath it ne'er vainly burned To commune with my heart? Or, am I a forgotten thing, A cloud on thy life's skyâ A showery day in thy life's springâ A perished weed thrown by? Then, then, farewell! and be thou blessed, As my scorned heart had striven to make thee: May life's harsh whirlwinds spare thy breast, Her arrows fail to overtake thee. Farewell!âa weary word for death: Yet, no!âthan death far worse! When lone and sad we draw our breath, Consciousness is a curse! Farewell! my soul melts in that word, My pride forgets its threatened war! My heart hath lost its master-chord! My life its leading star! TO ?, ON HER MARRIAGE. With snow-white marriage-wreaths I saw thee crowned, Gentlest and sweetest being! while around Stood the beloved ones of thy rosy years, With cloud-o'ershadowed smiles, and rainbow-brightened tears! Thy lovely glance, bright, feverishly bright, Seemed shrinking from their looks, and from the lightâ Thy rose-leaf lip was tremulously quivering, Like sunbeams on a rocking billow shivering; Thy step was like a startled fawn's upspringing, Remembrances of thy glad childhood bringing To us, who loved thee in those days departed, Who still must love thee, true and changless-hearted! And once again that deep scene seems to rise, And thou, with thy sweet mien and tearful eyesâ Thou! our own lovely one! and must thou part? Be it in cloudless trustingness of heart! Thou wert belovedâthou art belovedâand still May thy young days be screened from grief and ill! Be love the incense-perfumed torch, whose light Shall ever guide thy gentle footsteps rightâ Be love the thrice-charmed mantle that shall fold That graceful form of pure and lofty mould! Thou weepestâNature triumphs at thy heartâ Thou weepest, blessed and blessing as thou art! O! be those tears, like spring-showers gushing fast, Like spring-showers, brief and brilliantâbe the last Those innocent eyes may ever have to shed! Lift up, lift up that thoughtful-drooping head; Thou'rt but by fond familiar faces bound, By thine own kindred band girt meetly roundâ Affectionate hearts beat near thee, and the air Is thrilled for thee by many a whispered prayer! But now 'tis past! thy breeze-like tones and faint Have melted from the ear! the lone dove's plaint Less tender, sweet, and spiritually soft! Yet missioned airs to heaven those tones shall waft! But now 'tis past! those solemn vows are breathedâ 'Tis o'er! and, O, the marriage-flower-crowns wreathed Amidst those gleamy tresses waving bright, That shining fall with play of changeful light, Shall lightly sit upon thy lovely brow, (And, O, less stainless and less pure than thou), Their tenderest leaves, by young affection's dews, Nursed in the earliest freshness of their hues! May those soft tones, lately so faltering-low, With sudden laughter joyously o'erflow! O, may thy fawn-like step, the gayest, fleetest, That ever, when young life and hope are sweetest, Pressed down spring's greensward-violets, till their scent Loaded the air with slumbrous languishmentâ O, may that fawn-like step, now slow and shrinking (As thou on solemn themes wert deeply thinking), Once more be winged by breathless, thoughtless joy, Too light to droop, too exquisite to cloyâ That deep-flushed lip forget its tremulous quiver, Undimmed by spray-drops from life's dark-stained river; But may thy heart in changeless tenour move, As thrillingly alive to joy and love; For joy shines midst the trouble of thy mind, Like some rich jewel 'mongst dim waves enshrinedâ Some beauteous star midst curtaining mists enshrouded, That yet shall beam untroubled and unclouded! âI saw thee with thy marriage-crown in youth Stand lovely in thy heart's confiding truth! And when long years, long years, have circled by, O, may that eloquent and gentle eye Shine but with graver, tenderer constancy! May that unclouded forehead, smooth and fair, Its marriage-crown of light unwrinkled wearâ That marriage-crown, of deathless roses braided, Shall, when life's scattered roses all lie faded, Shine forth more deeply, exquisitely bright, Only in heaven to win sublimer light! FAME. Fame! sunlike shadow! lightning-winged breath! Vain atmosphere of meteors! haloing death! Thou lovely image of unreal good, Bubble on life's unfathomable flood! Thou'rt but a dazzling phantasm in the eyes Of earth's self-crowned infallibilities! Life, love, hope, happiness to thee are vowed, Thou fleeting ray, thou bright but vapoury cloud! Thou most capricious of all things that beâ Illusive dream of immortality! How many reap rich harvest of the bays For whom no lights of inspiration blaze! How many who deserve, but not desire, To wear that crown of inly-smouldering fire! How many who have toiled through lengthened years To win no meed save disappointment's tears!â But when, undreamed-of and unsought-for, Fame! Thou'st showered thy splendours on their blazoned nameâ Like that lone, lovely Abyssinian tree Which, all uncourted, unexpectedly Lowers her rich branches o'er those wanderers' brows Who pass beneath her fragrance-breathing boughsâ Thus, thus, thou clasp'st within thy dazzling thrall Those who forget theeâvainly prodigal!â And, O! the noblest gift thou canst bestow, How vain to assuage one pang of human wo! How vain to exalt one joy that thrills the heart From all the unmeaning din of life apart! The heart! O, vain is there thy mightiest sway, Thy kingly triumphs, and thy pÃ¦an-lay! Thy cup, whose burning draught can yield to those Who quaff it, all save joy and blest repose! Yet my weak heart hath coveted in vain Thy crown unheavenly, thy unlasting gain! Still fervidly it ever hath aspired, More than for vain renown, to be inspired! Quickeningly, thrillingly, inspired and filled With purpose high, through every pulse instilled! For well it knows, O Fame! thou'rt but a lureâ A treacherous path to tread, and insecure! Like the Mahometans' traditioned bridge, Keen as a scimitar's thrice-burnished edge, Fine as a slight aerial-textured thread, O'er the abyss of yawning ruin led! Even so, thy wavering, slight, frail bridge of breath Spans a dread gulf of darkness and of death! Oblivion's drear annihilation lowers Beneath; above, the amaranthine bowers Shine fadeless, but far offâthou ne'er hast led To themâtrack of the crowned and mighty dead! Alas! the Al Sirat Arch, once crossed and passed, Led to a happy Paradise at last! ELEGY. Long, long is thy night, cold and dreary thy bed, Too early the chosen and claimed one of death; The crown of young beauty hath fallen from thy head, And music and laughter have passed from thy breath. I bring thee a beauteous and freshly-blown flower; Its bells like thy soft brows are tenderly pale; It hath trembled 'neath morning's unsullying shower, â'Tis the lily, the unwaning moon of the vale! I bring thee thy broken, thy own favourite lute, O'er which thou wert wont so to warble and weep, While it answered with sounds that for ever are mute, And buried, like thee, in a fathomless sleep! Yet if the night-warbler here poureth his strain, Perchance its few chords may yet thrill to the sound, And solemnly, mournfully grieve and complainâ But too softly to startle the echoes around! O, nightingale! now from sad service absolved, Since the poet's Coleridge. high instincts have freed thee from gloom, Still, still let thy strain, all inwreathed and involved, Be one passion of sorrows while breathed o'er this tomb! THE STARS. Ye glorious, spiritually glorious stars! And dared men read in ye of woes and wars, Earth's fierce futurities? The righteous histories of the heavens appear The rather graven in each stainless sphere, And blazoned to the skies! Look to the ruins, wastes, and graves of earth, Her solemn doom since her proud empire's birth, Her coming fates to scan!â But, O! when ye would heave untroubled breath, And soar beyond the atmosphere of death, Turn to the stars! O, man! LINES WRITTEN IN DERBYSHIRE. I sat me down by the mountain-stream In its silvery pride descending, And methought it was like some fanciful dream, Wild horror with loveliness blending! I gazed on the rude and rugged rocks, Scarce reclaimed from gloom by the empurpling heath, Where the dark-coloured stones in shapeless blocks Frowned like death o'er the beautiful valley beneath. Then I gazed on that valley's delightful scene, Romantic with pastoral loveliness, And I felt that a spot so brightly serene Must be the calm site of happiness! O'er the blooming world that lay at my feet The sun his broad mantle of splendour was throwing, And clear was the air, and the heath-flowers were sweet, And the fresh mountain-breezes around me were blowing. And methought in an hour, even a deep hour like this, When Nature's wild beauties surround us, Our souls feel the noblest sensations of bliss, And earth teems with enchantments around us. With enchantments? even so!âAh! those rocks darkly frowning, With a charm more impressive the scene had arrayed; And, O! never was sunlight a fair landscape crowning, But it borrowed a tenderer attraction from shade! And, O! 'tis for ever and ever on earthâ These meetings of brightest and gloomiest thingsâ Of young passion and death,âand of sadness and mirth!â Ah! the wormwood still lurks in earth's loveliest springs! If we fain would repose where no shadow descends, Where no blight dims the leaf, and no canker the flower, Where no wormwood with springs of enchantment e'er blends, We must wait for a swift-hastening, dark-rolling hour! SONG. [So hath it ended, and for ever] So hath it ended, and for ever, That happy dreamâsince 'twas a dreamâ Which, 'gainst my heart's first faint endeavour, Soon rocked that heart on passion's stream. 'Tis ended, and I have endured,â Though with what withering agony! To disappointment long inured, Now, now it seemeth new to me. Well, it hath ended, and for ever, That happy dream, the pure, the deep; Yet, must I from its memory sever? No! still I worship that, and weep. EVENING. 'Twas evening, and a lovely and a lulling evening 'twasâ Soft, slumbrous murmurs lightly ran through the wavy shadowy grassâ Bright birds were homewards flitting, scattering songnotes faint and few, And heavy grew the soft warm air, all redolent of dewâ Sweet dew! that mantled and arrayed all things in quivering splendour! Sweet dew! that made the violet-leaves their richest scents surrender! The lengthening shadows slanted from the mountain's flowery sideâ The half-veiled landscape with a depth of dreamy hues was dyed! Ah! 'twas such season and such scene as silently compels Long-unremembered feelings from their sealed and shrouded cellsâ Inducing a luxuriant calmâa solemn mood and high, While melancholy's thousand chords are attuned to harmony! A mood from which no wanderer-thought, in feathery bondage held, Would wish to escape, though prisoned there, and softened down, and quelled! O, 'tis a tender bondage this, as lightâas soft as sleep! Sleepâthat, like summer's purple heaven, doth all in beauty steepâ Sleep! O, that most familiarâthat most 'wildering miracle, When all the music of the soul lies locked within its shell! Yet e'en more wondrously divine, and more rich and glorious seems A waking world of phantasies and ever-changeful dreamsâ A waking world of visions, spread before the uncurtained eyes! As in such sweet aÃ«rial mood unsoughtâundreamed ofârise! That mood which, like the dove, doth all unwearied evermore Brood on itself!âor like the wave o'er its unseen pearly store: Words never may its mysteries highâits sweet discrepancies unfoldâ O, in this world are feelings old, unlanguaged, and untold! Though they by thousands have been felt, by tens of thousands knownâ Silence still overpowers them from her wide and viewless throne! Thus this blest mood â of sadness rich, and of influence pure and fineâ (How all wild and dark emotions in its hallowed sphere decline!) Language may never breathe away the mists that wrap it round! 'Twould shrink from the aÃ«ry thrall of wordsâthe silvery touch of sound! Calmer the spirit seems to lie than some many-imaged lake, When no breeze may crisp its crystal-depths, its azure mirror break! O, 'tis a reconciling charmâa mediatorial spellâ The trouble of our worldly griefs and our worldly joys to quell! THE AWAKENING. My heart! the honey-dews of sweet repose Have vainly blessed thee! thy hope's broken Rose Still o'er thy wakening sheds its desolate leaves! And, O, that lovely ruin dimly flings Such shadow o'er thy brightest loveliest springsâ They flow like cold, cold waves on wintry eves! Yet still, as some clear-shining mountain brook Gives back, with faithful undistracted look, The bloom or blight of the o'erhanging flowers, So dost thouâever sad and sorrowing heart, All alteredâdarkly altered, as thou art, Glance back each aspect of life's changeful hours! IT SHOULD NOT BE, AND SHALL NOT. My soul! â eternal soul!âthat still shouldst look beyond the grave, Nor trust thy priceless freight of hopes to the world's unstable wave! Thou that shouldst, in thy rushing might, with the royal eagle spring, Still strengthening, by a thousand flights, thy strong tempestuous wing!â Shouldst thou haunt earth's unlovely wastes and wildernesses hoaryâ Forsaking all heaven's outstretched realms of melody and glory? Realms where the blight shall never comeâthe thunderbolt shall fall not! My soul! eternal soul!âaway!âIt should not be, and shall not! Wake from thy perilous tranceâO, wake! it cannot be too late! Be the eagle still thy strong compeer, and the morning-star thy mate; Be thou led by quenchless beacons still, which waver not, and sink not; And, charioted on sweeping clouds, which faulter not and shrink not! Lean thou on the everlasting rocks, which the earthquake's crash shall shake not, And be thou knit to nobler strength by the cords which bind and break not! Thou shouldst not spurn those golden cords, which strengthen and enthral notâ Thou shouldst not shrink from heaven's light yoke!âIt should not be, and shall not! O, shouldst thou heap dark treasure-piles in sanctuaries of dustâ To leave but for the worm and moth, and the annihilating rust,â And like a weight of mountains e'en on thy labouring strength to lie,â Bartering for Care's corroding storesâthe sunshine of the sky? It should not be! O, thou shouldst hoard rich treasures which decay notâ Immortal treasures, pure and deep, which dazzle and dismay not. It should not be! O, thou shouldst seek those pleasures bright, which pall not! It should not be! reply, my soul!âIt should not be, and shall not! Such inextinguishable hope â pure faith â meek worth â be thine, That thou mayst calmly view thy westering star of fate declineâ That thy memory o'er life's lengthening wastes and bewildering tracks still hovering, May exult in speechless thankfulness, not one dark stain discovering. My soul! thou shouldst not nurse wild thoughts in a pround and reckless hour! Back they return â the avengers of their own perverted power! Back they return â those blighting thoughts, which fain thou wouldst recall not! And should this be? It must not beâit should not be, and shall not! Shouldst thou stoop thy soaring pride to love, and bear its burthening chainsâ (Dark love! for ever grief and fear demonstrate where it reigns!)â Shouldst thou, with all thy worlds of might, be rocked upon a breath? My soul! undying soul!âwhose strength should mock the strength of death! Shouldst thou make a worship frail and wild of a fading aspect hereâ Forgetting all the Beautiful of thine own immortal sphere? No! thou shalt not tremble at a sigh, a glance shall thee enthral not! It scarce could be! O, shame of shames!âIt should not be, and shall not! Shouldst thou dwell in cold forgetfulness of those awful truths sublime, That make a pilgrimage of life, a shadowy pass of time? Shouldst thou prize alone earth's glittering gifts, the poor, the vain, the frail, That at thy darkened hour of need shall melt away and fail? Ah! shall Conscience even in agony of conquering triumph reign, And in the majesty of wrath! the sovereign might of painâ O'erwhelming thee with terrorsâthee, whom the world's crush should appal notâ It may not be, it must not be!âIt should not be, and shall not! Shouldst thou reap the thousand blessings o'er thy lengthened journeyings showered, Nor melt into thanksgivingsâthou, the illumed! the upraised! the dowered? Shouldst thou turn from many a bursting springâfrom many a scattered treasure Of gladdening hopeâof strengthening trustâof pure and priceless pleasure? Shouldst thou waste with spendthrift-thoughtlessness the ne'er-returning Time â That lightning-pinioned messenger from heaven's far empyreal clime! That awful, dread possession, in which worlds can reinstall notâ O, should this be? hear, Heaven and Earth!âIt should not be, and shall not! ON A TOMB. Thou solemn, sainted, lone, and lovely spot, Where all but immortality's forgot! My worn heart hails thee with no shrinking sigh, For many-featured death in majesty Of calm, heaven-breathing peace seems here to rest, Tempting the long-tried and the long-tired breast! Is it the eternal real that doth assert, Barred from the world, its empire o'er the heart? While touched by Death's wand earth's dark trials take Their proper shade and shape, and stir and wake The immortal in the heart! the heart which mourns, Yet mourning, still disdains its griefs! and burns For other worlds than this of vain regrets, Of Heavens that thunder, and a Sun that sets, Of rainbows still unreached, spring-flowers arrayed In dazzling glory but to droop and fade! Of glorious harmonies that float away, And all things beautiful that cannot stayâ Of meteors bright that sparkle but to fly, Of love, deep love! that only smiles to die! O, but it is! it infinitely is!â Death's world of shadows casts eclipse o'er thisâ Only, like night, ten thousand worlds to unfoldâ To shew creation's glorious page unrolled! Ah! 'tis even so!âavaunt, all idle fear! The trueâthe real, is developed here! O, but it is! it infinitely is!â Life hath her thousand tones of bale, of bliss, Solemn, or jubilant, or piercing sweet, And the heart's thousand echo-cells repeat Those changeful breathings! Life's rich voices still With every varying modulation thrill! Ay, life hath language fervid and intense! Deathâsilence! vague, stupendous eloquence! And well it is with us if we perceive Its mighty drift, and fittingly receive! How awful is that deep, that breathless hush!â Our trembling spirits crowd, and heave, and rush, To fill up the dread pause, which seems to press The future through the soul! that breathlessness Which holds suspended every pulse of life, In midst of all its stormy play and strife! It isâis infinitely! Death! stern Death! Thy language, soaring high o'er sound and breath, Outpierces far all music of the earth! All golden melodies we've loved from birth, Whether the murmured sweetnesses that dwell In the deep lyre, the poet's chorded shell, Or passionately glad the wild bird's note, Which winged with happiness through heaven doth float, Like our unsheathed, upspringing thoughts, when glow Those chainless thoughts in quick and starry flow. Yes! thou hast whispers soft, like sounds in dreams, Or haunting murmurs of faint far-off streams, Still to detach from earth, to draw, to wean The soul from every sublunary scene! Lo! when a mighty warrior's tomb is crowned With sculptured pomps, and banners sweeping round, With helm and shield and high armorial crest, (Ah! can they soothe that stern and marble rest?)â With lengthened scrolls and proud emblazonries, That bid his memory crowned with triumph rise, (Ah! can they lift his spirit to the skies?)â When a dead monarch's burial-thunders peal, Teaching us ermine's vulnerable as steel! Or humbler clay to clay consigned demands Our kindred care, since bound in brethren-bands, In sheaves of brotherhood, are all mankind, By Heaven's own hand!âwhat hand shall then unbind? âOr all we love unpityingly departs, Leaving us to the silence of our hearts, Bequeathing us a burdening weight of care, And ever-yearning souls, scarce stilled by prayer;â Thou still arraignest every inmost thought, Thou still dost teach, as thou hast ever taught, The present's nothingness, the future's weightâ The arrowy swiftness of our mortal date. Thou still hast tones too deep and too distinct, Wherewith our spirit-breathings all are linked Unbrokenly! till the earth with echo-cells Of the far heavens is sown, in scented bells Of spring's first flowers, still lurking; and in leaves Of beauty, rustling round our household eavesâ âThe thousand-tendrilled ivy, or the vine, Purpling the hills where southern suns outshine;â And midst the light or thunder-burthened clouds That hide the sky with their beleaguering crowds, Or with sweet murmurings of the lapsing rill, Or sounds that float along the breezy hill;â And with low sighings of the wandering breeze, And tremblings running through the whispering trees, With shells from jewel-fretted grots uptorn, That blush beneath the wave like the red morn, And melt in melody for evermore, Like links of lovely sounds from shore to shore!â Mournfully still awakening! still abounding,â Commingling, or conflicting!âstill resounding! Ay, with all music of the flower or tree, All music of the earth or of the seaâ Still, still those tones are mingling, faint, more faint Than sigh of reeds, or night-winds' shivery plaint; But yet, however faint, however low, With every language, sound, or breath below, Commingling or conflicting!âwith sad power O'erwhelming us from thy absconding hour! O Death! strong Death! still wheresoe'er we tread, By thee we're chasteningly admonished! Boundless thine influence is o'er this frail worldâ This bridge, whence thousands momently are hurled, Even as by viewless winds! far, far away From the blue warm dominions of the day! Far, far away! to regions where even thought May follow not!âto realms begirt and fraught With mysteries unimaginably deep, Unreached by fancy, and unglimpsed in sleep!â Realms where the piercing winds ne'er shaped their flightâ Where never rolled the o'ersweeping tide of night; Where the swift-rushing morning never flew, Her dewy crowns o'er vale and mount to strew! But from those realms full many a token strange Thou'st sent, O, Death, unto this world of change! Full many a sign we sorrowingly descry, Where'er we turn a contemplative eye! Midst every earth-born wreath we sadly find Thy shadowy, cold night-blowing flowers entwined! Thou writ'st mysteriously, o'er sun and seaâ Lands vintage-crowned, where summers loveliest beâ Deserts where ancient Silence sternly broods, And ever-rocking forest solitudes!â O'er capitals of old regalityâ O'er all the beautiful beneath the sky!â Even o'er bright aspects in the light of youth, Lovely and radiant as the sunny south,â Mysteriously thou'st charactered even there Thy mournful truthsâthou that ne'er deigned to spare! Boundless thine influence is, strong Death, and deep, Thou viewless and unknown! whose shadowy keep Encloseth all earth e'er hath loved or fearedâ All man hath scorned, despised, admired, revered! Boundless thine influence and thy conquering thrall! And, O! beneath thy shadow the' endless All, The infinite, seems hid! the unknown, untried,â The impervious secrets to our grasp deniedâ The mysteries none may ever dream or tellâ The vagueâthe dreadâthe incomprehensible!â For which the human heart still pants and aches, Even whilst for human griefs it bleeds and breaks! And the unquenched soul, whose conquest-heightened thirst Rages unslakedâthe sould that fain would burst From every fetter, every cloud, away, And seize its proud inheritance of day!â The soul that seeks and strives for evermoreâ That rushes onâa sea without a shore! Uncalmed, insatiableâthough it possess Treasures of knowledge, still to happiness Uncoined! Though, all victoriously swelling, Fountains of genius in its wastes are welling; And in its strongholds, ne'er by eye explored, Harvests of wisdomâpure and priceless hoard!â Are proudly heaped, and richly piled and gathered, Strengthening its glorious energies, when withered By time or grief, or sharp corroding care,â (Which, like the ever-falling drop, doth wear The strongest and the mightiest mind at length, Making a very mockery of its strength.) Though in its awful depths, enshrined, amassed, Marvels and mysteries dwell! though deeply glassed Within those mighty boundless depths may be The o'erpowering wonders of eternity! Still, still that haughty soul shall know not rest, But ever rush upon its endless quest! Still, still for the unattainable, the unknown, It yearns!âPower, Grandeur, Knowledge, Bliss, Renown, Can never fill that aching void profoundâ Which nought can search nor reachâwhich nought can sound! Still, most sublime to its strong passion seems The vague stupendousness of shadowy dreams, That haunt unceasingly the aspiring thoughtâ The soul, inflamed, concentrated, o'erwroughtâ Ambitious for the impossible! In vain It doth extend its space-o'ermastering reignâ In vain it triumphs in victorious might, Careering, like the wind, on its free flight; In vain it clasps, weighs, interpenetrates All worlds!âall universes!âand creates More wonders than it conquers! still, afar, A beckoning mystery lures from sun and starâ Still wild ambition aims beyondâaboveâ Triumph of triumphs! could it melt in love! Death! I have wandered far and long away From thy deep themes, thy purifying swayâ The calm pervading thy untrodden haunts;â But now once more my wearied spirit pants For full repose! Pale Angel of the Grave, O, let it turn to thee! fain, fain 'twould crave Thy deep immeasurable quiet now; So softly reared thy visionary brow Appearsâso cloudlessly thy form's impressed On all around, in traits of beauty dressedâ In tenderest hues and loveliest flowers arrayed, Forming a paradise of this sweet shade! Pale Paradise of shadows and of theeâ Oasis-isle of immortality! O! the heart almost doubts theeâthou'rt too much Like happiness that shrinks from every touch! The heart, so oft betrayed, so oft deceivedâ So oft of its most cherished hopes bereavedâ Doth almost doubt theeâas its fears doubt all That proffereth honey-dews instead of gall! Thou seem'st, for even imagination's grasp, Too mighty, and too vast. We fain would clasp Thy phantom form of beautyâwan, but fairâ We clasp, and gaze, and, lo! thou art not there! Thou seem'st, with all thy crowning mystery deepâ Like visions shadowed forth in feverish sleepâ Alas! to melt awayâto floatâto flee From the ardent gazeâtoo beautiful to be! Too, too much to be wished for, to be won! too rife Of uttermost blessedness from this bleak life Estranged, to be on earth achieved or gained; Or, in thine hour of conquering might sustained, Too precious, too inestimably dearâ Thou spring of victory! to be tasted here; Too wondrous and too glorious to be true, (For immortality hath still wrought through Thy dusky veil of clouds, revealing bright The intense transcendence of undying light); Or to be aught save a deceptive vision, Flushing the atmosphere with glows Elysianâ Too promising on this earth to be proved A universe of love to the unloved!â And, O! to those, the blessed on earthâto those Who on the trusted answering heart repose, Love, endless love, without change, bound, or shadeâ Perfect as undestructible!âarrayed In panoply of glorying strength, and girt With charmed powers all ills, all harms to avert! And now in thine own hallowed haunts I feel Thy solemnizing influence round me steal! My trembling soul thou seemest to surround With dreams! Dreams? No! with certainties thou'rt crownedâ Thou precious hope! thou that must be fulfilled! The ever-restless heart shall so be stilled! The heart of many tendrils!âit shall cease To ache and yearn! gathered to breathless peace, And all its trials, all its sorrows o'er, Shall reach at last the calm and golden shore! And even the soul of fireâth' aspiring mindâ The bliss, the triumph, and the peace shall find! Farewell! O, solemn tomb! all must be well With thee, calm home! and those who in thee dwellâ With me! Well! be it so! whate'er it be, No mote's o'erlooked through all the infinity Of gathered worlds, stretched to their thundering race Through fixed duration and unmeasured space! Wellâbe it so! whate'er it be, I know From whence th' unerring dispensations flow; O, be it so!âthough it be grief, I feel The inflicting hand the aching wounds can heal!â Yetâyet again, farewell! I turn with pain Back to earth's myriads and myself again! I must renounce this rich forgetfulness Of earth and careâthan every happiness Less holy and less highâhow far more dear!â Pure as are death-bed thoughts, or childhood's tear! Yes! 'tis a spiritual luxury thisâ A spring of soul-intoxicating blissâ A draught of strange bewildering delight, Mantling with precious dews, rich, fervid, brightâ A draught of solemn ecstasy and deepâ Mighty the soul in glorious dreams to steepâ That must not be too freely quaffed, nor sought When virtuous action might crown virtuous thought! Then let me tear myself away! alas! Even as the lights and shadows swiftly pass O'er these low mounds of dewy, flowery grass. Too soon the immortal hues, the Elysian gleams, Will pass from my changed thoughts and wandering dreams! Still must I tear myself, and turn Where kindred beings smile!âah! oftener mourn! THE LOST PLEIAD. Departed world! O, whither art thou fled? âFor thou may'st not be of the past!âthe dead! Forefend the thought, great Heaven! No!ânot of those Wert thou, whose marked and measured span must close; But undestructibleâbeyond the storm!â Decay might never reach thy radiant form! Annihilation might not strike thy frame, Nor quench the unextinguishable flame That wrapt thee like a royal mantle round. But thou'rt no more in thy proud orbit foundâ Oh! whither hast thou fled? bright wanderer, say! Thou, undiscoverably rapt away!â Thou Light evanished, and thou World estranged!â All unsubstantialised, perchance, and changed!â In the rich effluence of immortal air,â Glorified, and transfigurated there! Thy very elements transfusedârefined!â Filtered and winnowed!âthou may'st be enshrined 'Mongst the empyreal suns of heaven's own light, Far from the shadowy confines of the night! And is there silence, breathless and intense, Where thou wert glorying in magnificenceâ Where thy deep harmonies rolled thundering by, Shaking the strong foundations of the sky? And is there chasmy desolation now Where thou wert triumphing of oldâO, thou Bright, awful denizen of eternity? No! like a huge unfathomable sea, Shutting above the vessel's wake or wreck! As thou hadst been a floating ray, a speck, The vast, the mighty space fills upâand, lo! No sign is left of theeâabove, below! And the uncommemorative air alone Rolls where once rolled thy splendour-streaming throneâ The mighty space fills upâno trace is left Of thee!âthe ancient night is shorn, bereft, Of thy deep beauty!âWhither art thou fled? Throughout what realms interminably spread, And what stupendous heights and depths afar Hast thou careered in glory, thou lost star? What is the goal of thy unmeasured race? Mysterious wanderer from space to space! Whither art thou inexorably fled? How wert thou through the starry labyrinth led? How charioteered? how harbingered? how borne Beyond the uttermost regions of the morn, Unto the unknown abyss that recks no bound? And shall the regal Night be thus discrowned Of all her starry splendours, one by one, Till she remain upon her shadowy throne Desertedâunilluminatedâlone? Majestic Night!âno Niobe art thouâ Thou mother of a thousand worlds! Thy brow, Thou true Cybele! crowned with blazing towers, In the dread pomp of thy victorious hours, Is all as haughtily upreared in gloom, Majestical, as ere the stroke of doom Dissevered from thee that refulgent world, Far from thy deep, untroubled bosom hurled! And thou, abstracted star! thou, too, may'st beâ Nay, mustârejoicing in eternity; But where the baffled thought may never dream, Though strong to pierce creation's vasty scheme. O, could this world through nameless ages last, Her sons once more, in the ethereal waste, Might view thee!âSince so far, so wildly far, Thou may'st have been translated, vanished star! (To realms where thought its course may never guideâ Distances unimaginably wide!) That even the rapid lightning of thy ray May linger for long centuries on its way! But yet at last, rejoining earth's far sphere, Once moreâvictorious over spaceâappear! THE END.</field>
