      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. TO Dr. HEBERDEN THE FAMILY MEETING; A TALE. It happen'd once, but when, or where, It matters not a single hair, The father of a numerous race Dispers'd in many a distant place, Unwilling that they more should roam, Felt a desire to call them home: Their situations were precarious, Their notions, and pursuits too, various; But this you'll see with half an eye, If I describe the family; The matter easily is done, So take the children, son by son.â It chanc'd to be the Eldest's The Poem of Ancient and Modern Rome. doom Early to fix himself at Rome, Eager those boasted arts t'explore Which flourish'd there in days of yore.â The Second The Helvetiad., an adventurous youth, Fond of simplicity and truth, Made wild Helvetia's scenes his choice, Allur'd by Liberty's sweet voice.â The Third Epistle from Lady Jane Gray to Lord Guilford Dudley., renouncing pleasure's calls, In our fam'd Tower's ill-fated walls Indulg'd his solitary way, And wept thy worth, excelling Gray, Lov'd fair-one! with each virtue born, That could the human mind adorn!â One The Alps, a Poem., struck with nature's true sublime, Resolv'd the rugged Alps to climb, And there enraptur'd took his post 'Midst regions of eternal frost.â A Fifth Netley Abbey, an Elegy., recluse, and deep in thought, The convent's lonely ruins sought; Pleas'd with its gloom, he pass'd his hours In Netley's antiquated tow'rs.â The Sixth The Temple Student, an Epistle., more active, and more prudent, Became a pert young Temple Student, Pursu'd the law, resolv'd to try it, But never got one guinea by it.â The Next A Poem to the memory of Mrs. Cibber. resign'd his youthful heart A vot'ry to poetic art; No serious toils could him engage, He woo'd the muses, lov'd the stage, And, warm'd by his theatric turn, Hung a fond wreath on Cibber's urn.â The Eighth Ferney, an Epistle to Mons. de Voltaire., with equal ardour fir'd, The drama's perfect laws admir'd, And sought them in those shades rever'd Which the Great Bard of Ferney rear'd; There he ambitious wish'd to raise A trophy to that poet's praise, Whose genius and example taught The heights to which they might be brought.â The Last The Monument in Arcadia, a Dramatic Poem. that rov'd, was Fancy's child, With each romantic notion wild; In search of happiness he flies, Seeks it beneath Arcadian skies, But finds his visionary scheme Was but a Monumental dream.â The father, as I said before, Turning full oft' these matters o'er, Resolv'd a spacious house to build, And have it with his children fill'd, That they, like birds of the same feather, Might all return, and dwell together. The size was fix'd, the plan was laid, And Dodsley supervisor made; For Dodsley long was us'd to be Fac totum in the family: Knew each child's merits to a tittle, Had nurs'd them all when they were little, Had brought them forward one by one, Nay taught them too alone to run: His heart accustom'd long to feel Their int'rests with the warmest zeal, He like a steady faithful servant, Was in this bus'ness mighty fervent. âWhat joy,â he cries, âfrom all disasters âTo see safe home my dear young masters!â âI call them young, for twenty years âWhen past, as yesterday appears! âThey'll find me older grown, no doubt, âBut Tully's Head will mark me out.â âWould they were come!âI long to see âYou circled with your family! âThen urge their haste, for in a trice âYour house will be compleat, and nice:ââ Th'advice was good; the father writes, And all his family invites, Each in the kindest terms intreating To come and form a General Meeting. âChildren,â says he, âit moves my wonder, âThat you have liv'd so long asunder, âDispers'd in such far distant places, âYou scarcely know each other's faces!â âBy my own reck'ning it appears âSome have been absent twice ten years, âWhich makes me with impatience burn âTo see, and welcome your return. âThen cheerfully obey my call, âI've room enough to lodge you all; âAnd e'en should time more children bring, âI may hereafter add a wing. âHere you may live with one another, âAnd each protect a younger brother, âWho never yet from home have stray'd, âAnd want your countenance and aid. âYou've seen the world enough, and know it, âAnd to the little folks must show it.ââ Swift as the post the mandate flew, And homeward soon all parties drew. The house in nicest order drest, They metâwith joy each other prest, And talking over their past dangers, Vow'd they no more would live as strangers; But whatsoever should betide, Would fall, or prosperâside by side.â Dodsley stept in with eager pace, Presented them his well-known face, And still his honest zeal expressing, Gave each his welcome, and his blessing. Now, reader, sure you cannot fail To mark the moral to our tale; A hint from me might give offence To your discernment, and your sense: But if this family should share, Hap'ly, your patronage and care; Or of our house if more you'd see, At Tully's Head you'll find the key. ANCIENT AND MODERN ROME; A POEM. WRITTEN AT ROME IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LV. Sum ex iis qui mirer Antiquos: Non tamen, ut quidam, temporum nostrorum ingenia despicio. Neque enim quasi lassa, et effÃ¦ta natura, ut nihil jam laudabile pariat. Plin. Epist. lib. vi. ep. 21. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LX. Or Muse, or Dryad, whosoe'er thou wert, Who oft in Britain hast vouchsaf'd to hear My voice invoking, as some artless lay I caroll'd, or light song, to greet the ear Of Friendship, hither to this distant soil (Soil favour'd of the Nine) repair, and with Thy smiles direct me, studious to describe In numbers not uncouth, as o'er these scenes Pensive I wander, what of ancient arts, And monumental grandeur, still remains, Midst the proud ruins of immortal Rome.â Immortal did I say?âyes, once so deem'd, When like a goddess on the rapid blast High mounted, to the kings of climes remote She sent her laws, and saw the world obey.â But Time, capricious parent, gives to all Their morning, and their eve; and having shewn Mankind some prosper'd child, mark'd it for fame, And rais'd it to its noon-tide hour, delights To pluck its honours off, and sink it down To teach an awful moral in the dust! And such thy doom, these stately ruins tell; These stately ruins, that from various shores Attract the traveller, whose bosom burns With strong impatience, by the classic page Excited (faithful register of worth) To visit thee, thou once great seat of arms, Thou nurse of heroes; with respectful eye, To gaze upon thy temples, o'er thy heaps Pause rev'rent, and amid this wasteful mass, Trace out thy former glory.âWell indeed, Poor mournful reliques, conscious of your shame, And mindful what ye were, well do ye strive To hide yourselves beneath the shelt'ring leaves, Or the kind umbrage of the neighbouring moss. But whilst I tread the silent streets of Rome, Where cowls supply the helmet's blaze, where now Creeps o'er the shaken battlement the vine; Let me a moment recollect the years When Fortune led her onward, and success Outran her hopes; admire her dawn of life, Her scanty family, midst lonely sheds; Simple, laborious, of her future pride Planning the basis: Mark each vary'd step, Her change of government, her laws, her strength; Her politics, her wisdom: to the field Accompany her march, and see her crown'd With triumph, and with spoil, while the subdu'd With fear mix'd admiration, and rever'd The hand that conquer'd.âThen in ev'ry breast Breath'd public virtue, and each bosom felt The glow of libertyâTheir youth, inur'd To exercise, and toil, (the soldier's school!) Were taught to scorn fatigue, contemn a life Of indolence and ease, and die with joy To serve their country!âMaxims such as these, Sure as the herald's trumpet, loud announc'd The deeds that follow'd:âprompted by this flame, This patriot spirit, lo! a sacred train Of Heroes born to such exalted acts As in these distant, these degen'rate times, Almost o'ertax belief!âThy name, O Rome, Re-echo'd thro' the globe, from where the Rhine These Rivers mark nearly the utmost extent of the Roman conquest., And swelling Danube These Rivers mark nearly the utmost extent of the Roman conquest., urge their foaming course Ev'n to Euphrates' borders: Afric's sons Proclaim it in their desarts, and the streams Of Tagus roll it to th'Atlantic deep: That both at morn, and eve, the sun beheld Her banners wave. Nor did she give mankind Her chains alone; where'er her eagles flew, They bore the gentler arts of polish'd life, Attendant on her conquests!âThus she shone, And the world hail'd her universal Queen!â O could I here break off, here close the view: Nor see the laurel wreaths, by valour earn'd, By virtue dignify'd, blasted and torn By foul Corruption's hand!âbut 'tis with states, As men, too often grandeur's treach'rous smiles Warp the well-meaning heart, pollute its springs, And prompt the active mind to drop its task.â When virtue pauses she recedes!âThus Rome, Cloy'd with prosperity, and of her fame Grown careless, in the roseate bow'r repos'd Of Luxury: (that false one, whose soft lap Hath lull'd the mightiest) drank her baneful cup, And to her music lent a ravish'd ear: As fatal, as whate'er by ancient bards Was told of Sirens, or of Gorgon's head, That ruin'd with a glance.âWhat tho' its force It urges not impetuous, slowly sure, Like subt'lest poison, it pervades each sense, Each power of action, and corrodes the frame, Till death atones for folly!âNor did Rome Fall unremember'd, since her name alone Inspir'd such dread, that ev'n her pale remains By Superstition drest, guarded by priests, Who blending policy with holy faith, Relying on the crosier, not the sword, Roll'd terrors thro' the world; stain'd many an age With guiltless blood; and still with weaken'd sway, (Now milder) bids these hallow'd fabrics rise, That yield a second subject to my song. What tho' oblivion in her sable veil Hath wrap'd thy former splendor, yet ev'n now, Thy mould'ring fragments, ivy-crested tow'rs, And arches, tott'ring to their fall, remain, And in their antiquated liv'ry, speak Their better fortune.âPillars, that amidst The solemn scene, by many an insult scarr'd, Stand up historic; rifted vaults of fanes, And palaces, whose wide disparted roofs Threaten each visitant: and frequent seen Some shatter'd urn that hath betray'd its charge, To mix with vulgar dust.âOr should the charms Of Sculpture wake attention, here the eye Finds rapturous delight, whilst it beholds, The chiselled stone such mimic life assume, And property of being, that it seems As Art could rival Nature.âEvery sense Submits t'illusion, while before us stands Gigantic Hercules These statues are esteemed by all as the most compleat pieces of ancient sculpture now at Rome., on his huge club Resting his weight enormous: or the limbs Of matchless Flora, thro' her flowing robe, Press decent on the sight: so charms the step And graceful carriage of the Delphic God The Apollo, which stands in that part of the Vatican which is called the Belvidere.: Laocoon's anguish, and the beauteous form, Too beauteous form, of fair Antinous! Alike demand a sigh: nor shall unmark'd The Gladiators The fighting and dying Gladiators, universally known by their casts. pass, with manly force, Greatly expressive; nor the confident brow Of Meleager; nor thy pensive air, Dejected Agrippina In the Villa Farnese on the Palatine hill..âWith new joy The mind reflecting o'er th'enliven'd bust Shall pause, supremely pleas'd, as face to face, Amidst the bright assembly we appear Of chiefs and sages, whose heroic deeds Beyond the storms of fate superior shine On Fame's eternal record.âIn their looks We seem to read their story, ev'ry trace Remark inquisitive, and oft' return, As some fresh action of their life revives, To gaze, contemplate, and admire again. Oh ever-wond'rous art, that from the schools Of Greece cam'st hither to this favour'd clime, Yet rarely hast vouchsaf'd to pass the cliffs Of the proud Apennine, or cheer the cold, And genius-chilling regions of the North! The anxious voyager who sees the port Whither he's bound, and where before his thoughts Were long arriv'd, feels rising in his soul A sudden transport; not unlike, perchance, Is that sensation which the stranger's breast, With expectation's fire already warm'd, Expanding feels, when from some neighb'ring height His greedy eye takes in the nodding piles Of old magnificence, or darts its beam O'er the wide barren Now called the Campania of Rome: 'tis of very large extent, and from lying uncultivated, its air is very fatal to those who sleep in it during the great heats. plain, where tow'rs o'erthrown Lie broken, and sepulchral monuments Skirt all the blue horizon.âLet's away And wander midst the dank and shadowy gloom Of antique Baths, or the Pantheon's round, Well harmoniz'd, where dignity and grace, And just proportion reign. The Circus too Invites our steps, and the Tarpeian rock: How much unlike what good Evander shew'd Anchises' son, as thro' his little state, On Tiber's banks, the poor but friendly prince, His heav'n-born guest conducted!âmark e'en still, Spite of the Gothic spoiler, the proud tops Of obelisks, whose sculptur'd sides confess The mystic labours of Egyptian hands! And those tall Columns The pillars of the Emperors Trajan and Antoninus Pius. that preserve your names, Illustrious Pair, who to th'exalted state Of Emp'ror, join'd these titles more august, The wise, the good.âBut, let us bend our course To where the Amphitheatre's old walls Mantled in green, with many a winding, turn In circuit vast; while fancy paints to view All Rome assembled on some festive day, Rank above rank, with ev'ry face, intent To see the death-doom'd man, and nature yield To force superior. The pursuit of arms Had check'd each softer impulse, and forbad To call compassion virtue; nor was known, As in our times, the Stage's wiser aim, To steal instruction through the poet's song, To melt the stubborn heart, and teach the eye To shed the gen'rous tear for others' woe. Beneath the sloping side of yonder hill, Sacred to Jove, where stood the Capitol, Th'unpeopled Forum spreads; but yet a few Sequester'd pillars lift their heads, and point Some temple's site; strew'd round with mingled heaps, That wear the badge of hoar antiquity. While in the front appears the story'd arch, To Titus rear'd, when shouting Rome proclaim'd His Solymean conquest This arch is at the entrance of the Campo Vacino, from the Amphitheatre, and was erected by the senate in honour of Titus, after the conquest of the Jews.: then arose Thy fane, O Peace The temple of Peace stands near to it, was erected on the same occasion, and is esteemed to have been one of the finest temples in Rome., thou heav'n-descended queen! Parent of Arts! under whose fost'ring reign The Muses triumph; (shame upon the world, And man's corrupted heart, that thou should'st e'er Desert our habitations!) nor far off The Palatine's steep mount, where ancient tale Feigns the Twin Brothers found, but honour'd more By great Augustus' dwelling: now, alas! How is its lot revers'd! with mournful pine, And melancholy cyprus thick o'er-grown!â Here Desolation, mocking the vain farce Of human labours, and the low conceits Of human pride, thron'd on a craggy pile, Smiles pleas'd with her own work; amid the spoils Of Time's fell hand, where nought is seen to move. Save the green lizard sporting in the sun, Sole tenant of the solitary waste. Yet, O ye reliques, injur'd as ye are By the sharp canker of consuming age, Be ye my altars; on your grass-grown tops, Charm'd with reflecting what ye once have been, I'll sacrifice my hours; for you forsake The crouded haunts of men, where much is talk'd, And little reason'd; and with you, indulge That pleasing pensiveness yourselves inspire, That meditating mood. Nay ev'n when chill'd Beneath a wintry sky, her soaring wings Imagination droops, and her damp'd fires Burn weak and pale, then present to my mind Your well-known forms shall rise, spread o'er my thoughts A transient joy, and frequent be my theme. And do I walk the Forum?âand is this The memorable spot, on which have trod So many patriots, who in freedom's cause Unsheath'd the sword of justice?âyes it is; I know it is.âIf in a Briton's breast, Tho' midst the ice of the far northern sea, Or realms, where slav'ry drags its hopeless chain, Beams the bright flame of liberty, say Muse, What must he feel in Rome?âperhaps I dream, And 'tis illusion peoples the lone void With yonder band of heroes, on whose brows Sits awful majesty, and round whose heads Twines the victorious laurel. In the van, (For who can all the visionary shades Of fleeting fancy count?) methinks, I see The Elder Brutus; venerable man! Parent, and judge; hard fate! to join two names, That must for ever jar; but yet behold, To one great cause still constant, he disclaims All partial ties, proud only to be call'd The Father of his Country.âClose behind, In sullen grief, and in his mantle wrap'd, The stern Virginius passes: mark his eyes Rooted to earth! on whose cold bosom stretch'd Like some fair flow'ret the rude storm hath crop'd, A slaughter'd virgin lies; from insult sav'd, From loss of honour, by th'indulgent blow: Nor, unreveng'd her wounds, since in her fall Was tyranny destroy'd.âBut what's yon troop, Rushing from out the Capitol, whose looks Speak terror to beholders? each array'd In senatorial robes, in every hand A dagger reeking with the crimson blood Of one but young in death?âYet hold!âI know; For at their head, intrepidly appears Another Brutus, to th'impatient throng Exclaiming, eager as they press around, âThat Rome is free, and CÃ¦sar but a name!â Hail Liberty, daughter of Heav'n! whose smiles Sustain'd the wand'ring Scythian, cheer the gloom Of Lapland's tedious night, and wanting which, The circling moon ne'er sees a people blest In all her visitations!âfound no more, In these once favour'd seats, where shall our steps Pursue thy flight?âTo where Helvetia's The ancient name of that country, which is now called Switzerland, comprehending the thirteen cantons, and all the free states in alliance with them. sons, Midst their cloud-piercing mountains, yet maintain Their manners uncorrupt? or where the cliffs Of far-view'd Albion, thy admir'd retreat Rise, 'midst the world of waters?âThere, O maid Celestial, ever reign; her children teach To venerate thy name, that the fair band Of peaceful virtues, which adorn thy train, May still be theirs; and Britain's fame expand From pole to pole: while with her freedom charm'd, Less happy nations tow'rds her sea-girt shores Shall sighing frequent turn their wishful eyes, Extol her fortune, and lament their own. But come, my Muse, thou mistress of my song, Let us to Tivoli's romantic hill, In rural beauty rich, where learning's friend And best protector, good MÃ¦cenas, gave The recompence to merit There are still at Tivoli great remains of the villa of MÃ¦cenas. (happiest task Of those whom plenty crowns!) or to the streets Of desolate Palestrina, throng'd no more With Fortune's votaries Palestrina is about twenty miles from Rome, and was anciently called PrÃ¦neste; it was famous for its magnificent temple, dedicated to Fortune, of which there are considerable ruins.: or the tranquil shades Of cool Frescati Frescati is th ancient Tusculum, and is distant from Rome twelve miles: they still show some remains of Cicero's house; and it is supposed it was here that he composed his Tusculan Disputations., in whose lov'd retreat Once Tully thought, and reason'd: then let's seek The wat'ry beauties of the Alban lake And Antium's pleasing shores,âor if perchance A shorter circuit better should delight, Stealing along, upon the winding banks Of yellow Tiber (in whose oozy bed The spoils of many a day, of many an Art, Lie sepulcher'd:) we'll mount thy sweet ascent, Madama The Villa Madama is just without Rome, on the banks of the Tiber, upon a beautiful eminence called Monte Mario Trastevere. It was built by Julio de Medicis, who was afterwards Clement the VII. and commands a most extensive view over Rome, and the whole Campania.; and beneath th'embow'ring trees, Or in thy past'ral theatre, where first The Faithful Shepherd There are in this garden the remains of a rural theatre, in which the Pastor Fido was represented, for the first time, before Cardinal Borghese, afterwards Paul the V. to the echoing woods Sigh'd out his am'rous tale, securely shun The raging heat, or wait the evening sky, Ting'd with unnumber'd rays; and from thy height, Reposing on some bank, by Nature's hand Richly adorn'd, contemplate all below.â There let us ruminate on old renown, And the long story'd page of ages past. Reflection hath its joy, a pensive calm That shrouds the soul, and bears it on the wings Of vagrant thought to Mem'ry's wide domain!â Now, now indulge it, while we sit and mark The mad career of Fortune, and behold Imperial Rome 'midst all her triumphs fall'n!â So closes ev'ry scene; and thus decay The works of men: allow'd a little space To shine, attract,âthen fade and be forgot! For ah! the paths that lead to pow'r and fame, And those which feel the peasant's silent step, End in one point: observe Ambition's flight, And laugh at all the wild fantastic dreams Of human folly.âSeeking thy embrace, O Virtue, let us court thee as our good; Our only treasure, and our only hope; Our shield to guard us 'gainst a faithless world, And all its venom'd shafts: for thou unhurt, Sprung from immortal Truth, serenely bright, Sustain'st the gen'ral wreck; and like the Sun Shalt still appear with undiminish'd light, When all the boasted monuments of pride Shall sink, and mingle with the dust they hid! Weep'st thou, my Muse, this changeful state of things? Nay sure they ask a sigh!âyet rather mourn, That man unthriftily rejects the gifts Which nature made him heir to. Heav'n points out A flow'ry way to all, nor bids its sons Tread the hard flint, or shun the joys of life.â Then wherefore, 'midst yon venerable piles Of pompous ruin, splendid fabrics rise, And swelling domes?âWhy do I hear the voice Of Superstition, bid her altars blaze? And see her beckon to the cloyster'd cell The blooming maid?âAlike the pride of youth, The blush of beauty yield; their blossoms crop'd Ere we can say they flourish'd!âhark! the gates Grate on their hinges to receive their guests, And hide them from mankind! like gems conceal'd In the dark womb of earth, whose radiance ne'er Shall woo th'admiring eye!âStill as their hours, Their useless hours, creep on, to waste their strength In painful pennance, at the tinsell'd shrine Count o'er their beads, and by the midnight lamp Mutter cold pray'rs, sent from the practis'd lips More frequent than the heart which rapture firesâ O blind, to think their safety lies in flight! Or that the steady foot of Virtue fears To tread the haunts of men! there most she shines, And conquers by example, stronger far Than preaching volumes, or recording brass. Arm'd of herself she braves each hostile dart, And only asks protection from the skies. Haste from thy cell, O Memory, and hide With blackest shades the day when first were rear'd Th'unsocial Convent's walls. Shock'd at the act, Man's guardian-angel fled, and left those breasts Which friendship might have warm'd, and great pursuits Guided thro' honour to the public good, A prey to folly, and that partial love, Which centers in itself.âThen broke the chain That best cements in bonds of amity Earth's num'rous family; then sunk the names, For ever sacred, and for ever dear, Of parent,âchild,âposterity: those ties, Which to our joys add joy; and pluck the thorns From half the ills that cross the ways of life! Still I recall the day, fresh on her cheek The purple bloom of youth, when Laura bade The world adieu In the following lines is described the ceremony of giving the first veil, on the admission of a nun., resign'd its flatt'ring pomps, And took the holy veil. I view her still Beside the altar, like a victim deck'd Magnificent; fair as the pearly dew Which on the rose-bud lies, or hangs within The lilly's cup, what time Hyperion mounts The eastern hills. Before the mitred priest She kneels submissive; on the sacred floor Casting those eyes, whose fires were sure design'd To light the torch of Venus, and provoke To am'rous parley; other office now Destin'd to serve!âWho can unmov'd behold Such sacrifice!âYet 'tis her choice, and lo! She sings consenting!âlo, the prelate cuts Her graceful hair! and strips it of the gems That sparkled 'midst her tresses; then conducts The willing fair-one to the convent's gate, Where she, in one last, one eternal kiss, Dissolves all social bonds. The Abbess there Receives her, and invests her beauteous limbs (Unfriendly change!) in coarse monastic weeds, Whilst all the virgin choir in hymns announce, âThee, Laura, thee, become the Spouse of âChrist.â Self banish'd, self condemn'd, now to thy cell, Too rigid maid, retire, and deck it round With bones, and skulls, torn from the ravag'd grave, To point a gloomy moral. Peace be thine, And calm content! nor ever may thine eyes, Like wand'ring exiles, cast a longing look Back to their native, their abandon'd home! Ne'er may wild Fancy paint in loveliest forms Those joys thy zeal renounces, nor excite The fruitless tear for liberty resign'd! Yet hence, the arts, in ev'ry age, have found A sure protectress; by Religion call'd To raise her temples, decorate their walls, And with unweary'd toil her sainted shrines Illumine.âHence, the pencil'd canvas glows With living forms, whose visionary charms Hold converse with the eye: the altar hence Declares the sculptor's skill, as from the hard And rugged rock, his wonder-working hand Brings forth the imag'd martyr. Hence behold, In one vast St. Peter's. Pile conjoin'd, proportion, grace, Strength, elegance, and grandeur; union, form'd To challenge admiration, and insure Praise universal; coming nearest that, Which man must deem perfection.âMusic too, From voice melodious, and the vary'd string, Sends forth the soul of harmony, like spells Spreading enchantment round, 'till vaulted choirs Ring with th'Eternal's praise, and men attempt What happier Seraphs hymn.âThrice blest the age Which virtuous arts adorn! by them the heart Grows more refin'd, by them the breast is warm'd To nobler deeds, the laws of civil life More taught, more study'd: brutal valour turns To reason'd courage, and the mind awakes To scenes unknown before; as the calm lake Shews its embosom'd landscape, which lay hid While the rough tempest swept it.âWherefore else Stand Europe's sons the foremost in renown? Or why doth India, midst her splendid mines, Shine undesir'd?âsuch were the happy times, When Plato trod the Academic grove, And spoke of wisdom: such, when Rome beheld Augustus thron'd; such too, in later years, When Leo rul'd, and the thrice gen'rous hand Of Medicis, his hospitable gates Wide open'd, courting all, whom genius, worth, Or learning dignify'd, to come, and rear A Tuscan Athens.âHail, illustrious Name! Thee shall the Muses sing in every clime Where science prospers; Thee, whose friendly arm Rais'd the neglected mourner, bade her smiles Spread their mild influence o'er a polish'd state, 'Till thine own Arno flow'd a rival stream With fam'd Ilissus.âCasting off the veil That had so long disgrac'd her, Sculpture then, Lur'd by the voice of her lov'd Angelo Michael Angelo Buonaroti, a Florentine, one of the most celebrated artists in sculpture and painting, but particularly in the former., Rose from her Gothic trance, proud to assume Once more her Attic dress: and with her came Her fair companion Painting; to the world First shewn by Cimabue Painting was first revived at Florence, by Cimabue, towards the end of the thirteenth century. He was soon after followed by Giotto; and there are remains of both their works in the churches at Florence., an infant then, Rude, and unform'd; but by the skilful care Of Giotto nurs'd, her beauty and her years Advanc'd together, till she shone complete In ev'ry virgin charm; sweet as the nymphs, Who, when Aurora opes the gates of day, Sport at her side, and to the jocund notes Of lute and harp, around the Morning Star Dance festiveâEver sacred be the soil That gave her birth! Happiest Italia, thine Hath Heaven mark'd fortunate; by nature deck'd E'en to profusion. Here the Artist oft, Or solitary Bard, deep-musing roams, Eyes thy gay scenes, inhales the Southern breeze, And catches inspiration.âDwelling meet For Fancy!âHere, the pleasing maid display'd Her varying talents, fix'd her schools, and taught Her mysteries; selecting from the band That woo'd her favour, an appointed Few, The heralds of her art, to raise at once Hers, and their own renown.ââMy sons,â she cry'd, â(For dear as sons ye are) take from my hand âThese pencils, by myself prepar'd; whose pow'rs âShall win ye admiration, lasting praise. âFor to Fame's temple there are many paths, âNor for the hero, nor the sage alone âWreathes she her laurels; all by honest means âWho seek them, wear them.âThou, my âRaphael, go âProsp'rous, and on the Vatican's proud walls âFix an eternal name; an air divine, âSublimity of thought, and touch correct, âShall mark thy labours; 'till in One combin'd âThine ev'ry pow'r shall shine, and Nature's self âGrow jealous of thy skill The picture alluded to is the Transfiguration, now in the church of St. Pietro Montorio, at Rome, esteemed the finest picture in the world.

That which was form'd to captivate the eye, The ear must coldly taste; Description's weak, And the Muse falters in the vain attempt. And thou, O Time, whose all-destroying scythe, Busy, and fatal, as the shaft of death, No human toil escapes; whose deafen'd ear No pray'r can sooth; but from this transient scene, To the dark realms of silence, and of night Condemn'st the sons of men, and with them, all Their little pow'rs created; thy resolves Tho' nought can shake, yet oh, awhile suspend The purpos'd blow, and with thy wings protect These precious reliques of a science lost! That their felt energy may still inspire A noble emulation, may awake Each latent spark of genius in the breast, Till with the circling years new Raphaels rise, To swell the canvas with enliven'd force, And fix their great idea on the soul. ON THE DEATH OF A LINNET. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LI. Beneath this fragrant woodbine's shade A little Songster's bones are laid; Who, ever innocent and gay, Felt all his hours glide smooth away; No guilty passion tore his breast, No dream of Greatness broke his rest; He with a cheerful, patient mind Play'd well that part the Gods assign'd: Nor matters it, when this be done, How soon the thread of life is spun! Ye warbling Tenants of the grove, Approach this spot, and mark your love; Light hov'ring round on airy wing Soft notes of plaintive friendship sing. So may no prying eye pervade The hedge-rows where your young are laid, Nor cruel hand of wanton boy Your dwellings plunder, or destroy: Far may you bend your flight from where The artful Fowler spreads his snare, And live from ev'ry danger free, Enjoying still sweet Liberty! A PASTORAL ODE TO ECHO. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LII. Sportive Genius of the Green, Frequent heard, yet never seen, Tripping o'er with printless speed, Fairy-like, each flow'ry mead, Ranging ev'ry hill along, Stealing ev'ry Plowman's song; Whether waving in the wood, Whether skimming o'er the flood, Panting on the Southern gale, Or reposing in the vale, Posting on a Zephyr's wing Hither come; and with thee bring Gentle Hope, to solace one By a cruel Nymph undone: Hear me, where beneath the shade, Pensive mourner, I am laid, Deaf to Music's native note, Pour'd from many a warbler's throat; Blind to all which pleas'd before; Smiling landscapes charm no more. Waft my sighs to yonder plains Where the haughty Fair-one reigns, Who with Beauty's subtle art Chains, and triumphs o'er my heart; Let their murmur reach her ears, Tell her all my Hopes, and Fears, She alone lost peace can give, Tell her, 'tis for her I live; Tell her, to my passion true, Tho' repuls'd, I still pursue, That her Graces I adore, Tell her alsoâbut, no moreâ Love admits of no delay, Little Mimic haste away. ABSENCE; A PASTORAL ELEGY. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LII. And must I ever vent my Sighs in air? Tho' with a true, yet fruitless Passion burn? In sorrow still lament my Absent Fair? And will her truant steps no more return? Ah me! I fear she will disown the Plain, Our humble Village, and our peaceful Green; Else in the noisy town she'd ne'er remain When Spring invites her to the Sylvan scene. She, who was first to pluck the early rose, And twine a garland for the May-pole's head; She, whom our festive Virgins ever chose Their Rural Leader, is unkindly fled! Why tarries thus my Fair? when Nature sheds Her gay profusion o'er the rising year? When for my flocks the mead its treasure spreads? And woods and lawns in vernal pride appear? Perhaps some polish'd Lover courts thy smile, And pours his flatt'ring accents in thine ear; Or does some wealthy Lord thine heart beguile, And keep thee absent from thy shepherd here?â O! let not Wealth, or Flatt'ry warp thy mind, Their blandishments will soon deceitful prove, And thou their victim then too late may'st find That artless Truth alone is friend to Love! Love lights his torch at Virtue's sacred fires, He comes in sweet Simplicity array'd! Far from the pomp of life by choice retires, And seeks the covert of its tranquil shade! No lands have I, no honours to display, Alike to Fortune, as to Fame, unknown; I only boast a heart that mourns thy Stay, A faithful heart, that beats for thee alone. The bloom of May, like thee, that's ever fair, The brook clear-bubbling, and the cooling breeze, E'en the mirth-moving bag-pipe, foe to care, When thou art from me, lose their pow'r to please, Ah! what avails to tread the flow'ry field, Or view the landscape from the clifted Steep! No objects now their wonted pleasure yield, But seem like me to languish, and to weep. While my companions mingle in the Dance, And each is jocund with his constant maid, I muse on Thee, bewail my own mischance, And sullen, set me down beneath the shade.â Return once more, sweet Nymph, and joy excite, Bright as thyself shall Nature then seem drest; Bring back thy blushing Graces to my sight, Reward my Truth, and make thy Shepherd blest. WESTMINSTER ABBEY. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LII. I All hail! thou venerable Pile, Within whose caverns deep The boasted Worthies of this Isle In Death's embraces sleep! II Lost in those thoughts thy gloom inspires, With pensive step I tread; Extinguish'd feel youth's warm desires, And muse upon the dead. III The tutor'd Mind here justly learns How human hopes to prize, As round these trophy'd walls she turns Her meditating eyes. IV The sculptur'd Urn, the mimic Bust, The Grave in pomp array'd, Serve but to teach us, Man is dust! His life a fleeting shade! V More than the morning Vapour vain, Which melts away in air! Unless to Wisdom he attain, And Virtue be his care. VI Doom'd is his Race in all degrees, One final lot to know; Tho' some are warn'd by slow disease, Some summon'd at a blow!â VII In these dark chambers of the Dead, Life's idle pageant o'er, Unnotic'd now rests many a head That once the Diadem wore. VIII Heroes, who Conquest's falchion drew, To Death, sole Victor, yield; Some who perhaps once Poictiers knew, Or Cressy's blood-stain'd field! IX Tho' Regal Glory mark'd their ways, Tho' Fortune swell'd their pow'r, 'Twas but a transitory blaze! The triumph of an hour! X See Rivals stretch'd out side by side, Whose Rage once shook the land! The tongue of Arrogance how ty'd! How impotent the hand! XI Here let Ambition read its fate, And check its tow'ring mind; And those whom wealth, or pride elate, Here a just lesson find. XII Extinguish'd now is Wit's bright fire! Lost its enliv'ning themes! Mute and unstrung the Poet's lyre! Clos'd, Fancy's rapt'rous dreams! XIII All silent, Truth's persuasive voice To holy Prelates given! Who shew'd the World its wiser choice, And taught the way to Heaven! XIV Nor e'en can Beauty's subtle charms The claim of Death evade; Or steal from his rapacious arms The Love-devoted Maid! XV See this declar'd on yon rich shrines That virgin ashes keep, Round which the sculptur'd garland twines, And marble Cupids weep.â XVI Yet let us not with such dismay This dreaded Victor view; For if he tears our joys away, He takes our sorrows too. XVII To those whom torturing pain opprest The shelt'ring Grave gives peace; There the worn traveller finds rest! The world's hard conflicts cease! XVIII There all the wrongs of Fate severe, In cold oblivion lie! Grief wounds no more!âfor ev'ry tear Is wip'd from ev'ry eye!â XIX Stop, Stranger, whosoe'er thou art, And to thyself be just; These mould'ring Tombs address thine heart: Catch Wisdom from the Dust. XX Religion only forms man's soul Calmly to view his end; Can his vain passions best controul, In Life, in Death, a Friend. XXI A Day will come in Time's long reign (Such hope hath Heav'n reveal'd,) When Graves shall render up again Those whom they once conceal'd. XXII Then shall Creation's Mighty Lord Bid ev'ry slumb'rer rise; And Angels' tongues this Truth record The Virtuous were the Wise! ON THE MARRIAGE OF TWO FRIENDS. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LIII. I The Priest the holy knot hath ty'd; Returning from the Altar's side View yonder festive Train: Their looks the smiles of Gladness show.â Far from their steps be Care and Woe, Nor this bright morning stain! II Thrice happy they, whose faithful hands Are knit in HymenÃ¦al bands, Whom strong affection fires! Pair'd by free choice, who nobly slight That Demon Int'rest, at whose sight Love's sacred torch expires!â III Hail! Marriage, from whose genial source In purest stream flows Friendship's Course To cheer the human heart! Thou best canst bid each Virtue live, A keener sense to Pleasure give, And blunt Misfortune's dart! IV Let gay Lothario ever seek False transport on the Wanton's cheek, And wedded Faith upbraid: But by his restless passions torn Still shall he roam about forlorn, A poor, unsocial shade. V Ne'er shall his narrow bosom prove The varied charms of lawful Love, By Time, by Worth refin'd: The mutual wish, the mutual joy, And those delights which ne'er can cloy, The raptures of the mind! VI When man in Paradise remain'd, And o'er that new Creation reign'd Which might endear his life, He view'd it as a gaudy waste, A world of sweets he could not taste Till Heav'n had made a Wife. VII Then, Eden breath'd a softer gale, The landscap'd hill, the flow'ry vale, With wonder caught his eye; Whilst his fair Eve beside him stood, How great! how glorious! and how good! Was all beneath the sky.â VIII Come, smiling Concord, to thy care Jocund receive this wedded Pair, And lead them to thy bow'r; Where Truth's bright wreath shall bind their head, Content their path with roses spread, And Love his blessings show'r.â IX So pass their years!âand grey in age Still may the world their hopes engage, And they new Youth attain, Whilst circled by a virtuous Race, The records of themselves they trace, And tread back Life again! TO A LADY; FROM HER DEAD BULLFINCH. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LIII. Why does my Mistress mourn my fate? Or murmur at my alter'd state? Escap'd from that diurnal care Which Birds, like other mortals, share; No more a slave to Hope and Sorrow, The poor Dependent on to-morrow!â When I look back on life, I view Nothing to raise regret, but You. A little trifling part I play'd, From infancy a captive made; Your love alone could solace me, And balance loss of Liberty!â The grateful tribute from your eye, The fond remembrance, pitying sigh! Since such a lot to me is given, I envy not the Bird of Heav'n. But, gentle Maid, tho' life seems fled, I'm only in appearance dead; In Greece a Sage did once maintain That bodies die, but souls remain, And without any creature seeing, Slip into some new kind of being, Compell'd to gain a safe retreat In the first lifeless Form they meet. Thus I, pursuant to his plan, Tho' late a Bird, am now a Man; Snug in the body of a Beau, I flutter round where'er you go; For ever ready at your Call To deal the cards, or join the ball. A light, fantastic, merry thing, As usual, always on the wing, I'll cherup at all public places, Toast you as fairer than the Graces, And dangle, flirt, protest, and sue, As other pretty fellows do. And haply if on me should shine Those smiles which once were wholly mine, Would you caress me, now prefer'd, As you caress'd me when a Bird, Grant, Heav'n! I may a Man remain, And never change my Form again! AN ODE WRITTEN AT BAIÃ IN THE SPRING OF M.DCC.LV. I As pensive on thy silent shore, Thy mould'ring Temples I explore, And breathe an air serene; Whilst I on all thy beauties gaze, O BaiÃ¦! in unstudy'd Lays I'll trace thy joyous scene. 'Tis not the rapture of poetic fire, But that harmonious ease which thy soft gales inspire! II Where'er our wand'ring steps are born, Gay Plenty pours her lavish horn, Blessing thy fertile ground; And Phoebus with his golden rays Upon the trembling water plays, Glitt'ring on all around: Whilst the rich Orange, and the Myrtle join'd With many a fragrant plant, perfume the wanton wind. III Lo! on thy Bay's enchanting side Parthenope The ancient name of Naples. in stately pride Rears her majestic head! Still more to aggrandize the View, Behold where dire Vesuvius too, Thy Safety, and thy Dread, With far-heard echos makes the mountains nod, Flames with eternal Fires, and thunders like a God!â IV With pallid Looks, and languid Eyes, Chill'd by the blasts of northern skies, The Stranger seeks thy coast; Soon with a blush his visage burns, The cheerful smile of Health returns, Such charms thy breezes boast! Jocund he springs, the happy clime adores, Bears back his strength renew'd, and blesses BaiÃ¦'s shores. V When Rome's dread banners were unfurl'd And flutter'd o'er a subject world, Dominion's pride to swell, This spot, its Chiefs with raptur'd eyes Beheld, here bade their Villas rise, At BaiÃ¦ fond to dwell.â And, wretched matron! Agrippina, here Oft' sigh'd a Nero's Crimes!âOft dropt a Mother's Tear! VI Nor to the Great, the Fam'd alone Was this delicious region known, The Muses sought its shade; Here sweetest Virgil rang'd along Maturely plann'd his artful song, And all his skill display'd: Bade the Cumean Grot to ages last, And o'er Avernus' Lake a darker horror cast. VII What verse, chaste Bard! like thine could show The wandring Trojan's vary'd woe? Describe his tortur'd mind? Or that keen anguish which opprest Th'enamour'd Dido's royal breast, Her Hero too unkind: With his hard toils Lavinia to obtain, And poor Evander's grief for his dear Palla's slain!â VIII Come, bright-ey'd Fancy! hand-in-hand Let's range o'er this poetic land, And wind our pensive way, Pause, and contemplate as we pass Each time-worn Fabric's ruin'd mass, Still beauteous in decay: Now that the vernal hours so much invite, And all th'enraptur'd soul awakes to new delight! IX Each tuneful Bird his tribute pays, Each Flow'r its glowing hues displays, Free'd from a wintry Tomb; Myriads of new-born Insects run To hail th'invigorating Sun, Gay in their transient bloom.â What joy, Instructive Nymph, with thee to rove, And mark Creation's works in one strict order move!â X This constant Change which Nature feels, Man's pictur'd history reveals, Methinks I hear Thee say, Doom'd like the Lilly high to spread A little while his graceful head, The blossom of a day! Then drooping sad, conclude his fleeting reign, And sinking, shed his leaves, to bud and bloom again XI Life's cheerful Spring and Summer past, Our sober Autumn comes at last, And warns us to the earth; Philosophy becalms our breast, In peace Religion bids us rest, And wait a second Birth, When to a Spring eternal we shall rise, And bursting from the Grave, shoot upward to the Skies. THE HELVETIAD: A FRAGMENT. WRITTEN AT GENEVA IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LVI Now shine auspicious on my arduous task, Ye Sisters of the Lyre; who on the top Of fair Parnassus blooming garlands wreathe, To bind the temples of those happy few Ye deign to call your own!â'Tis not enough That I invok'd you, when my daring pen First trac'd this Theme, of Freedom; still vouchsafe To guide it onward;âfor I call you not, Celestial Maids, to hang an amorous Lay On Beauty's shrine, or aid some trivial song; 'Tis your own causeâ'Tis yours to rend the veil. Of dark Oblivion, and bring forth to Day Virtue's firm votaries!âTo fix on high, Beyond Time's envious reach, the Hero's name, On Fame's immortal scroll; that it may thence Shine to succeeding Ages, and inspire Mankind to imitate what you record!â 'Twas now that hour of silence and repose, The Dead of Night, when Darkness, like the Grave, Hides all distinctionâwhen the Fairy Tribe, As ancient story goes, beneath the bush Of rose, or woodbine, hold nocturnal sports; And Witches crouching under blasted trees, Mutter their mischiefsârestless, and forlorn, Alien alike to Virtue, as to Peace, In some sequester'd corner pines the Wretch Whom conscious Guilt tormentsânow all the pomp. Which pours its idle flatt'ries round the Great, And dazzles and deludes the vulgar eye, Remains unnotic'd; and awaits the morn To ask again its homageâCalmly sunk In slumbers such as Temperance insures, On his low pallet stretch'd, the Lab'rour lies, Pillow'd by soft Content; nor sighs to know The dreams of Princes, near whose stately beds Pale Care his melancholy vigil keeps.â The village clocks around the Lake struck Twelve, And cross Lucerno's waters with shrill note Twang'd on the silent air; speaking the hour, Th'important hour's approach, destin'd to fix The future fortune of this injur'd Land; But speaking it unto those ears alone That conscious knew the summonsâNor did they Such monitor requireâfor slowly creeps The tardy foot of Time, when the soul teems With deeds of import, and impatient waits The executing moment.âOnward came Led by three different paths, the Patriot Chiefs, By Fate selected, midst these rugged scenes To plant that Freedom, which in after years Should shoot, should flourish, and its blessings spread, O'er all Helvetia's Sons.âPensive they walk'd, Warm'd by such virtuous ardour as inspir'd The Roman spirit, when the name of Rome In rigid honor bright, from the wide world Claim'd reverenceâFaithful at th'appointed place They duly join'd.âIt was a clay-wall'd Hut, Bosom'd in tufted trees, which on the verge Of craggy pastures sloping to the Lake Stood hid in silent shade; where, when the heats Of Summer rag'd, the shepherd-boy was wont Careless to stretch his limbs, what time his flock Cropp'd the sweet wild-thyme, or the umbrage sought Of some o'er-shadowing cliff.â'Tis not the place Which dignifies the act!âThe noble mind Is ev'ry where the same!âNor let the Great Who hold their councils but in tapstry'd halls, Deride this simple scene.âO! would to Heav'n! That all who sit in Senates, and decide The plans of Empire, thither went with minds As firmly independent, or as warm To feel with indignation ev'ry wrong That shakes their Country's peace!âThe door now clos'd, Suspended from a beam one lamp was hung To cheer the gloomy walls; and in each face Such greeting shew'd, as is far stronger told By looks, than language.âWhen De Stauffach thus Op'd the nocturnal meetingââWelcome, Friends, And welcome Brothers; for the name of Friend, As that of Brother, best belongs to those Whom one good Principle, one honest Fame Unite in Love: albeit that the world Adulterates the titles!âWe are met, Like pious Children round an aged Sire, To prop his feeble arm, his silver hairs From infamy protect, and to his griefs Speak comfortâsuch our taskâand such a Sire Our Country is; far other times than these Once us'd to knowâThis State, which first beheld Our dawn of life, which rear'd our youthful years, Which saw us shoot to manhood, and hath yet Preserv'd our properties, now calls aloud Complaining; summons ev'ry honest breast To feel its wrongs, and with a parent's voice Chides our unkind delay: each hour we breathe, The stern Vicegerents of proud Austria Tread on our sacred rights! judging their wills To be our only laws.âSay, shall the tide Of wanton pow'r o'erwhelm us? shall we sink, Nor buffet with the torrent?âIs it meet We stand unmov'd spectators? tamely gaze Whilst the destroying flame lays all things waste? Rather let's leap into the funeral pile, And with our Country's ashes, mix our own.â He, who was born to Freedom, ne'er forgets The charms of Liberty, or e'er can bear Oppression's iron hand!âYet think, my friends, Smiling at human arrogance, aloft Th'Eternal Justice sits, with arm prepar'd To crush the ripen'd Tyrant, and avenge The conflicts of the BraveâThere rest your trustâ Haply through this dim labyrinth, his hand May shape our course, and point in our distress Some honourable means to loose our chains E'er yet they bind too hard, e'er yet sweet Hope Be but an empty name.âBetter to die Than live inglorious! happier far not be. Than be dependent on another's nod!â Ye guardian rocks, that round our little states Irregularly noble, raise your heads Majestic, down whose woody sides the rills Urge their wild course; how jocund was I wont To gaze upon you all?âhow raptur'd once Rang'd I your clifted steeps? with Nature charm'd, And fair Simplicity:âand thou, lov'd Lake,â Who play'st in murmurs at their stony feet Thou too my joy hast witness'd: seen the smiles Content paints on the peaceful brow!âBut now, Ye guardian rocks, that round our little states Irregularly noble, raise your heads Majestic, down whose woody sides the rills Urge their wild course, no longer do I range Jocund, your clifted steeps; the echo sweet Of Liberty no more allures!âAnd thou Lov'd Lake, who murmur'st at their stony feet, Must henceforth cease to witness to my joy, Nor more canst charm! for tyranny, alas! Hath stain'd thy streams, and every spring is foul!ââ Here paus'd the Patriot; for adown his cheek Quick roll'd th'involuntary tear, and stop'd His fault'ring voice; it was the tribute paid By Sensibility to Social Love!â Not for himself he wept, no private loss: His gen'rous mind embrac'd a suff'ring land And unborn generationsâTears like these How rarely see we now!âYet howsoe'er A sordid interest, or selfish views Mislead an erring world, the human soul Ne'er shines more bright, than when she feels, and aids The wretchedness of others!âOn such worth Approving Heav'n looks down, and, smiling, bids Recording angels register the deed!â With countenance attentive, Furst took in His friend's complaint;âand added, âNor to me Less odious is the cause which brings us here; 'Tis ever present to my thoughts; when morn Calls up the healthful Hind, or evening calm Bids peace to man;âbut unto such as me Bids it in vain! for restless slumber they Who taste Affliction's cup: on my worn heart Still preys the bitter draught, and mocks reposeâ Or when tir'd Nature haply yields, even then Fancy for ever pregnant, to my sense Pictures her visionary shapes, nor scarce Allows my sorrows pause.âLast night I dreamt, (Nor slight a dream, tho' reason interdict Too fond a credit) that beneath the shade Of a tall spreading oak, whose branches cheer My small paternal Farm, I musing sat My Country's fortune; how the hand of Fate To states, to princes, and to private men Portions their bliss and woe; when I beheld An aged Form approach me, which portray'd My Father's person, whose dear mem'ry yet Is green amongst us;âDrest methought he stood As he was wont; and tho' my throbbing heart Panted for utt'rance, yet a tremor seiz'd My agitated spirits, and deny'd My tongue its office; whilst with aspect mild, And looks that breath'd benevolence and love, He thus reliev'd meââFar dispell'd, my son, âBe all that can alarm thee; view me here âA friendly visitant; nor unto me âUnknown thy suff'rings, or the worthy flame âThy soul is nourishing! I only come âTo give it life.âIf honour's virtuous seeds âAre not extinct, which in thy youthful mind âWith early care I cherish'd, let them now âIn vigour shoot, and blossom into fame.â âAffliction is our touchstone, she alone âBest shews us what we are, and summons up âIn the great hour of trial and effect, âA strength we knew not of!âThe time, my son, âIs nearly ripe, when this long-injur'd land âShall claim thy serviceâGive it as a man; âAnd thank the Heav'ns who call thee to assert âThe glorious cause of Freedom.ââSaying this He seem'd in act to part, whilst at his feet I threw me to embrace his rev'rend knees, And urge his longer stay;âwhen into air He melted like a vapour.âOn my sense Yet still th'impression of the Phantom lives; And there shall live, and prove my guiding Star.â The time is near (so said the honour'd Shade) To claim our servicesâAnd how so well Can we restore our groaning Country's peace, As from the hand of Pow'r boldly to wrest The staff of Office, whose oppressive sway Too long we've suffer'd?âOf their solemn trust When those ordain'd the Guardians of our laws Become forgetful, or misuse their charge, Plum'd in authority; 'tis Virtue then, Nay our strict duty, to protect ourselves, And thunder in their ears, They are but men, As such responsible.âFor say, my friends. What is the cement of our concord here? Or what the bonds which hold in amity The peopled world?âSprung from one gen'ral bed, Great Nature's children, we are all born free, And claim our birthrightâBut that Pow'r supreme, Who fashion'd first our complicated frame, Ne'er meant the soul of man should be controul'd By those base views which only move around The centre of self-loveâOur mutual wants, Our mutual means of aid, call'd forth to view Each nobler virtue, and awak'd the mind To Friendshipâto Benevolenceâto Fame.â Hence rose Society; Hence those dear names Which heart to heart unite,âand man to man; Hence all the tend'rest ties our bosoms know,â Hence Life's sublimest rapturesâNations met As one vast family, to share alike The future Cloud, or Sun-shine.âWhile the cause, Or injury of each, was felt by all, And strictly judg'dâRulers were chosen out As gen'ral Parents, to protect their rights And vindicate their wrongs; whilst unto them Honor, obedience, and respect were due, As their just tribute paid.âThis mutual chain Links States, and Empires; 'tis the compact firm Of kings and subjects; but if once 'tis broke, Or should this gen'ral Parent e'er betray His sacred trust, or prove a gen'ral foe; The reign of Nature must again return, And her first, strongest law, isâSelf-defence.â To whom, thus MelchtalââWorthy countrymen, I with an eager ear have unto both Listen'd attentively; and all you've said Seems to wear Reason's stamp.âHis native rights Man never should relinquishâfor the soul By Tyranny feels its bright powers debas'd, Its faculties relax'dâ'Tis Virtue's grave!â And all those generous springs on which she moves When Liberty's fair smiles protect her hopes, There lie entomb'd!âtheir ashes but produce A principle of conduct tenfold base, I even shrink to name it,âabject Fear!â The Freedom by our Ancestors obtain'd, And unto us devolv'd, we hold in Trust; It is a sacred Pledge left in our hands, Of which we're but the Guardians, strictly bound To yield it up to our posterity Pure, and unstain'd.âO then, let Pity's eye Dart thro' the veil of years, and view the Race Who shall spring from us; and in after times, When we're consign'd to dust, live in our stead, Tread the same path, with passions, and with hopes Like us endu'd, and all their claims as just!â This crisis slipt, they may hereafter want Force to regain what we ignobly lost!â But grant they shouldâBy Time the mind is taught Patient to bear its ills; and as the rays Of Liberty decline, in the dark mist Which clouds its setting, Public Virtue sinks!â The rampant Lion taken in the toils Shakes fierce his shaggy mane, and combats hard To rend the chain that holds him; but his Cub Rear'd in a cage, unconscious of the joy To range the wilds, fawns at his keeper's feet, And, quite forgetful of his nature, yields.ââ âBelieve me, it transports my swelling soul,â Rejoin'd De Stauffach, âto observe your breasts Thus kindled by a flame which noble minds Alone can feelâTruth hangs upon your lips, And ev'ry argument with trumpet voice, Cries âsleep no more,â Danger is at our gate, And flutters round our roof with Raven wing, The prophet of our fateâThat which you urge For our Posterity, is that of all Which wounds the deepest, and pleads most within.â Were we alone the suff'rers, we alone Could bear the lotâour morn of life is o'erâ 'Twere but to pass its ev'ning with disgust, And close it somewhat hardly!âBut for those Who must succeed usâshould we cloud their hopes, Turn all their flow'ry walks to paths of thorns, Entail distress, and, sad inheritance! Bequeath them nought but BondageâO! alas! Think how severely they would judge of us Who saw the storm, yet left untry'd the means To screen them from its blast!âBabes would learn To stammer out the base perfidious names Of Melchtal, Furst, and Stauffach; and old Men, Sitting in Summer eves before their doors With all their gather'd family around, Relate our shameful story!âHeav'n! avert A guilt so deep as this!âIf that our names, When we've descended to the realms of Death, And Earth's return'd to Earth, by chance exist, Ne'er let Reproach sit mocking o'er our grave, And with contemptuous hand, pointââhere they lie!ââ Noâlet us act, that whether we are doom'd To triumph, or to sink, our future Race May joy to own us, may revere our deeds, And crown our memories with grateful praise.â As ere the deep-ton'd Thunder's voice is heard Th'anticipating Lightning darts around A momentary notice; so, with looks That quicker than his tongue his feelings told, Furst thus exclaim'dââThere needs not further words To urge thy purpose; Thee, our faithful guide, We'll follow resoluteâand what I speak Is but our common wish; my Melchtal's eyes Look approbationâpoint us out the path, We'll loiter not behind.âHow poor is life! Its joys how chill'd, when Liberty is lost! If joys may then exist; when the curb'd mind No longer dares to reason, but perceives At ev'ry turn a barrier, and must bow To each fantastic mandateâ'Tis a state Fit but for Coward slaves, who shrink at death, And guard on hardest terms a fickle flame Each wind may terminateâThe truly Brave Know no such feelings, but with fix'd Resolve Combat Misfortune, nor from Danger start.â And many such as these, our cause divulg'd, We'll find amidst our friends, our destin'd lot Of Fame, or Peril, emulous to share. Justice shall guide us, and her champions arm With that good sword which half obtains the prize, And oft to Vict'ry leadsâa Conscious Right.ââ Thus plainly reason'd Theyâtheir maxims drawn From Nature's artless volume, read by minds Which Virtue had inform'd.âCompar'd to this, How vain the idle sophistry of schools! The pride of pedantry, or Learning's boast!â Thank Heav'n! nor needs there these, to teach mankind Their duty to themselves, and to the World!â âNor think that we alone are pointed out,â Resum'd De Stauffach, âby the hand of Fate, And mark'd unfortunate; look but around The peopled Globe, in Time's revolving course All have their Tyrants, all their hours of Woe!â And as I well perceive the gen'rous sparks Of Freedom glow within you, let me now Augment their ardour, whilst I open lay Th'historic page, and to your ears unfold A deed of Fame, unknown perchance to you. âTho' lock'd from Infancy, within the Bounds Of these your barrier mountains, somewhat sure You must have heard of Rome? the glorious seat Of Arts and Arms, once Mistress of the World; To whom obedient Kings in ev'ry clime Submissive bow'd, and own'd Her pow'r supreme? You may have heard of CÃ¦sar too, whose sword Subdu'd the brave Helvetii, and defil'd These peaceful regions with the stains of Warâ Become the Leader of those num'rous hosts Who rul'd the fate of Empires, round his head The blooming laurel twin'd, and the loud voice Of each Plebeian rais'd him to the skies: But not content to share those high rewards The Roman state conferr'd, his restless soul, Lur'd by Ambition's visionary schemes, Aspiring still, strove to be Lord of all.â âBut while this cloud hung gath'ring over Rome, A few there were who mark'd with jealous eye This daring Man; saw, that at ev'ry step He trampled on their Rights, that ev'ry day But pictur'd Freedom lostâE'en now my heart, By our too sad similitude of Woe Feels their distress!âShall I go on, and say How oft they met? how oft deplor'd their fate, And pour'd their thoughts into each other's breast? Or of the league they swore to end his reign Who thus had all the various rays of Pow'r Centred within himself?âBut I should first Have told you, chief of these was CÃ¦sar's friend, By name a Brutus, in his fost'ring smiles Rais'd, and protected; but whose patriot mind, When by this gen'ral insult rouz'd, at once Cancell'd all private tiesââYe righteous Gods! âIf that I err,â he cry'd, as on the sword Which seal'd their mutual oath, his hand he laid, âIf that I err, my error wash my crime! âMuch to my Friend I owe,âmy Country more; âAnd judge me, if I not esteem the debt âThis native soil demands, beyond the bonds âWhich link our partial int'rests.ââTo be brief, His fatal hour was fix'd, and each prepar'd To stamp it with renownâIn blaze of day, Amidst th'assembled senate as he sat, They plung'd their daggers in his breast, and gave To Rome once more its FreedomâVictim like, Thus mighty CÃ¦sar fell, on whom mankind Had rivetted so long their wond'ring eyes, A sacrifice to Justice.âYet his dust Fame still protects, scatt'ring around his Urn Full many a flow'r, which graceful would have breath'd Their blushing sweets, had not a Tyrant's name With its dark shadow half their lustre hid!ââ He ended, and what time he thus describ'd Rome's bravest Soldier, and her direst Foe, With greedy ear the list'ning Two imbib'd The Home-felt Tale, which shew'd the rigid force Of public Virtue, that could thus prevail O'er an admiring People, and subdue E'en Friendship's tend'rest claimsânought they reply'd, But side by side stood rooted; till at length With ardent looks, they mutually grasp'd hands, And shot their souls in at each other's eye, Pregnant with noblest purposeâwell conceiv'd Of Bothâfor where concurrent Passions meet There needs no Herald's trumpet to announce Their meaning!âLanguage here had all been vain! Unequal to the workings of the Mindâ The awful silence of this solemn Scene De Stauffach breaking, thus his speech renew'd. âI see you're deeply touch'dâand who like you, Born with such spirits as are given to curb Th'Oppressor's arrogance, can hear unmov'd Th'achievements of the Brave?âIn gen'rous Minds There is a sympathy by Nature's hand Wisely imprest, making them prompt to feel Their mutual Injuries!âyet, thanks to Heav'n, Albeit the Insults of Licentious Pow'r, As it did Rome, hath gall'd us with its yoke, Our lot's less hard; the part we have to act Asks not the dagger's aidâfor ill is drawn The sword that stirs up civil strife;âto peace It rarely leads!âWhen forth in terrors stalk Rage, and Revenge, who fitly can describe The Horrors that ensue? or the dread scenes Of bloody Contest? which too often miss Their purpos'd good; and like to Rivers swell'd With sudden rains, lay waste the fertile banks They should have bless'd!âLet us forthwith select A faithful band, and with matureness weigh The means of doing rightâOur ripen'd strength, And ripen'd councils, then may boldly dare To disallow the tributary claims Of haughty Austria, nay disown her sway So long usurp'd, and from our States expell Her sanction'd Rulers, never to return Whilst e'en one arm is left to cross their way.â What now remains for us, but here to pledge Our Lives, our Fortunes, and our Fame, in bonds That death alone shall cancel, ev'ry joy Henceforth renouncing, till we have restor'd Peace to our injur'd Country, or have fall'n Undaunted victims of the gen'ral wreck.â This be our League, and with a warm embrace Thus let us sign it on each other's breast.â So saying, close around each other's neck In cordial clasp they twin'd their folded arms, Firm seal of plighted Faith! while strongly throbb'd Each heart, as bearing record, and the tear Which glister'd tremulous on ev'ry eye Stood prologue of that manly, social love Which Virtue stir'd withinââThus let us standâ They cry'd, âa Bulwark 'gainst our Foes;âAnd Thou, Great God of Justice, from thy starry Throne Witness, and aid our Truth!âAnd ye bright Saints Who once like us were mortal, and like us Once trod the paths of Sorrow, liv'd in times Of trials most severe, and like us doom'd To combat hard for Freedom!âwheresoe'er Ye unembody'd dwell, still to our minds Be presentâBy your great Examples fir'd, Let us be taught firmly to persevere, And learn from You,âto triumph,âor to fall!ââ Thus clos'd the Council, for they now had mark'd The far advance of Night, and lest the eye Of prying Jealousy might o'er their deeds Suspicion cast, the ever faithful voice Of Prudence caution'd to withdrawâSo each Seeking again the way by which he came, Homeward return'd; determin'd to embrace, As Heav'n should will,âor Libertyâor Death.â Congenial Spirits!

If in those realms where virtuous spirits rest When human toils are o'er, aught here below Can give an added transport to your Joys, Amidst these honours of your native States, For what your Wisdom plann'd, your Valour won, Deem not this tributary Verse the least, Since it is offer'd by a Briton's hand!â And now Hyperion with his ruddy cheeks Rose from his wat'ry bed, and to his car Leash'd his swift steeds, impatient to begin Their Course diurnal: while the opening light Preceding like his Herald, shot its rays O'er all the Eastern hillsâThe Village-Cock Stretching his wings awakes the lab'ring Hind, And strutting round his cottage, loud proclaims, With clarion shrillâthe Advent of the morn.â THE TABULA VOTIVA, Occasioned by a Visit received from two young Ladies, while under Confinement with a swelled Eye. WRITTEN AT GENEVA IN M.DCC.LVI. The sharpness of the cutting Bize, The North East Wind, so called there. Too apt the human Frame to seize, Which blowing o'er this beauteous Lake, Can each soft muscle pris'ner take, Had so clos'd up Amyntor's eye, He scarce could any object spy; A cambric handkerchief around The weak side of his head was bound; Like Justice, whom we often find By Artists painted as half blind.â Three days he breath'd the chamber air, And idled in his elbow chair; Nay e'en the fourth had done the same, But that to Rumour's Ears it came, Who whisper'd it around the town, Till 'twas a serious matter grown; Enlarging as she went about, First 'twas one eye,âthen both were out.â But, Reader, let me here express My wish a little to digress, That I may paint this Gossip, Rumour, Offspring of Mischief and Ill-Humour; Of Truth regardless, none she'll spare, But spreads her Falshoods ev'ry where. Drop but a hint, she forms a Tale, And with it instantly sets sail; In circulation swift it flies, Indors'd by fifty other Lies.â Now at the Change her stand she takes, There groans, and Public Credit shakes; And e'er the imposition's known, The mischief's done, the Beldame flown.â Sometimes at Routs you'll see her flaunt, A tawdry, sharp-nos'd, Maiden Aunt; Who steady to her lov'd vocation, Whispers away a Reputation. âSo, Ma'am, you've hear'd, no doubt, Miss Prue âIs gone with Col'nel you know who, âLord who'd have thought it!âbut her Mother âWas, between friends, just such another; âOur Sex have lost all shame, I think; âPoor Lady Grace has ta'en to drink, âFew will believe it, but I clearly âHave seen it,âtho I love her dearly.â âPray, Madam, what do People say âOf our griev'd friend, the Widow Gray? âI hear, tho' broken-hearted reckon'd, âHer Footman's talk'd of for her Second,ââ Rumour by turns all dresses tries, Now splendidânow in mean disguise; Beneath the latter shape, you'll meet The Wand'rer oft in London Street As ragged as a Russian Bear, With Ginshop voice, and matted Hair, Proclaiming, while her head she louses, The King's Harangue to both the Houses; Or bawling with more dismal screech The Tyburn Hero's dying Speech, As how he clos'd his guilty life, With the last letter sent his wife.â And this is She the Ãneid sings, With fifty mouths, and fifty wings, Who flew about, than wind much faster, To tell of Dido's sad Disaster.â The Trojan Horse, as Virgil notes, Was cramm'd with Men instead of Oats, Rumour, like him, cannot digest What is for common stomachs drest; In her's, fresh News you still must throw in, To keep her mouth for ever going.â Amyntor's Case now being known, As we've remark'd, throughout the Town, A Thought came into Fanny's mind, A Thought benevolent and kind, To bring with her her Sister Kitty, And cheer his roof in gentle pity: For sure great Condescension is it, When the Fair make the Blind a visit! Good Nature led them by the hand, And close behind, in social band, The blooming Graces debonair Came tripping round this lively Pair. And here again I might digress, To sing their Beauty and Address, Their polish'd Manners, and their Ease, Sweet Power, and sweeter Wish, to please; But I conceive 'twould better run, If by a Simile 'twere done. Thus, when the Queen of Love, and Juno, Who was a greater Queen as you know, On Ida's Top their Rival met To see who could the Pippen get, Beauty There won the Judge's eyesâ Here Sense and Beauty shar'd the Prize.â And now behold them with the Squire, Sipping their tea beside the fire, With sprightly wit, and cheerful joke That liveliest converse could provoke. No more Amyntor felt his Pain, 'Twas Ease, 'twas Joy return'd again: The Eye disdaining to be bound, Impatient felt to peep around, Like a good Fencer play'd its part, And boldly push'd in Tierce and Quart; Its ardour made each fibre play, Gave it new strength to force its way, And exercis'd its pow'r so well That down the cambric bandage fell: Nor is it strange,âfor where's the Eye That would be clos'd when Beauty's by? Beauty can by its magic spell The gath'ring Gloom of Life repel, Its beams their radiant brightness dart, And make each hov'ring shade depart.â Thus Phoebus in a misty morning, Upon the Eastern Mountains yawning, Just risen out of Thetis' Bed, Throws off his cap, and shakes his head; His Eyes he rubs, his Arms he stretches, Calls for his Nags and Leather Breeches; Night's Vapours all before him fly, And well they know the reason why: In Prose or Verse Truth must be told, This Phoebus is a Sportsman bold, And hunts the Clouds throughout the Air As Men on Earth hunt Fox and Hare.â The Cure perform'd, what can I less Than warmest Gratitude express? I would a Votive Chaplet twine With Myrtle, and with Eglantine, The vary'd Hyacinth so sweet, The Moss-Rose, and the Violet, Which when arrang'd with Art and Grace, I at these Ladies' feet would place; But this I can't, and just the reason, There's not a Flow'r as yet in season: Our circling Alps still hid in snow, And bound in frost the Vales belowâ What's to be done in such a time? I'll e'en relate my case in rhyme, And tho' but little skill'd to write, Transmit my Thanks in black and white; And their kind Service to repay, These Lines upon their Toilet lay.â The Pilgrim thus for mercies shewn, His grateful sentiments to own, Journeys to seek the Altar, where The Saint's inshrin'd who heard his Pray'r; With zeal suspending at its side (Where fifty other such are ty'd) A Tabula Votiva, that Describes his Story very pat; Whence all who view it may confess The Saint hath pow'r to cure and bless. AN ODE TO FRIENDSHIP; INSCRIBED TO JAMES BRUCE, Esq. WRITTEN AT GENEVA IN M.DCC.LVI. I E'en let th'Ungrateful, and th'Unkind, The Faithless Wretch, the Narrow Mind, Enjoy their selfish Dream: Far let them wander from my sight, They ne'er can relish what I write, When Friendship is my theme. II 'Tis to a Heart like yours, that feels Each joy its sacred fire reveals, I consecrate these lines; Benevolence alone can know Its influence mild, that social glow Which ev'ry Sense refines. III In Nature's wisdom were we made Dependent on each other's aid, Life's pleasures to improve; Subject to Wants which Pity ask, Assign'd in turn that noblest task Of cheering those we love. IV Connected by this mutual tye, The World becomes one Family, Doom'd the same Fate to know; The gen'rous purpose swells the breast, And he who makes a Brother blest, Himself is doubly so.â V Fairer than any fabled Maid That breathes beneath poetic shade, Or sports in Tempe's vale; Grateful as is th'approach of Spring, Who wafts each blessing on her wing, Thrice lovely Friendship hail! VI As Life's uncertain ways we tread, Circled by Cares, with Dangers spread, How sweet thy soothing voice! To guide the morning steps of Youth, To fix them in the paths of Truth, And point them Virtue's choice! VII Nor less thy succ'ring hand we find When noon-tide Passions shake the mind, And give new Evils birth; Or in the evening gloom of Age, To calm its Woes, its Pains assuage, And prop it to the earth! VIII Vain is each gift that Wealth can show'r, Cheerless and cold Love's myrtle bow'r, By Thee, bright Nymph, unblest! Tho' Fortune lavish ev'ry joy, If Thou art absent, soon they cloy, Midst Splendor we're distrest. IX But, with Thee ev'ry walk is sweet, The public Haunt, the lone Retreat, The mountain's rugged sides; Thy Sun-shine gladdens ev'ry scene, Plays round the heart with ray serene, And human pomp derides! X However humble be the spot Where Destiny shall fix my lot, My fig-tree, and my vine, Would Friendship make my roof her care, And plant her envy'd blessings there, I never should repine. XI Confiding in a chosen Few, Calmly Life's bus'ness I'd pursue, And my good stars commend; In pity sighing for the Great, Who 'midst their luxury and state Scarce find a real Friend. THE ADIEU: Presented to a young Lady at Geneva, on her setting out to return to England. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LVI. And is, alas! the parting hour at hand That calls Thee Fair-one to thy native land? Will this sweet Lake, these Mountains charm no more? Or keep Thee longer on a foreign shore? Ah! noâthis Lake, these Mountains plead in vain; 'Tis England asks TheeâWhy should I complain? True to that worth which long shall be rever'd, I'll range these scenes thy presence so endear'd; Recall those jocund hours of social mirth That gave to Pleasure, gave to Friendship birth; Too soon they fled! too strongly leave behind Their fond remembrance to distress the mind! Oft still shall Fancy meet Thee in our walk, In the cool breeze still listen to thy talk, And roving pensive the imbow'ring shade, Half hope to find Thee, thou excelling Maid: Alas! our wonted walk no more will please, The shade imbow'ring, or the cooling breeze!â Thus, when some gallant Vessel to the gale Leaving the Port, unfurls each swelling sail, The Merchant views her, less'ning as she flies, Till lost in Mist she mocks his aking eyes: Nor even then can end his anxious Care, His Hope, his Int'restsânayâhis All is there! VERSES, OCCASIONED BY VISITING IN 1756, A small CHAPEL on the Lake of Lucern, in the Canton of Uri, ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF THE FAMOUS WILLIAM TELL. As this personage may not be recollected by every reader, it may not be improper to observe, that though he was not one of the Three distinguished Characters who first planned the Liberty of Switzerland, yet he had an active part in that Revolution.âTell having given some slight offence to Gessler, the governor of Uri, Gessler, in the wantonness of tyranny, sentenced Tell, who was accounted a most expert Archer, to shoot off an Apple placed on his Son's head.âThis he effected, without hurting the child; but exasperated at the cruelty of the command, from that moment openly renounced the Governor's authority; and joining the other Confederates, became effectively the means of accelerating this important event. While Flatt'ry's hand adorns the swelling Dome, Inscribes the rising Column's trophy'd base, Or titles strips from prostituted Rome, To deck some wretch, the scandal of his race; The lowliest Roof that Piety can rear, The humblest Turf o'er Virtue's cold remains, To Contemplation's eye more fair appear Than all the wonders of Egyptian plains. I shun the Pile that Tyrants ashes keeps, Its splendor ne'er can tempt my lonely way; Amid these peaceful scenes, these rugged steeps, These sky-topp'd rocks, with more delight I stray. Eager I seek this Structure, yet unprais'd, Which all Lucerno's subject Lake commands; Of simplest form, a rude memorial rais'd, Not by ambitious, but by grateful hands. To Tell 'twas rear'd, whose Country was his pride, Who join'd those Bands which made that Country free; Renounc'd Oppression's yoke, and boldly cry'd âSpurn it, my zealous followers, like me.â What tho' no looks (some daring Artist's boast) In Parian Stone thy anxious mind confess, No sculptur'd Infant fills the dang'rous post, And eyes a Father's terror and distress: Yet in rude Painting is thy Story told, Thy firmness register'd on faithful walls; While those who feel its blessings, here behold A Tale, that all their gratitude recalls. Yes, shade renown'd! while Freedom boasts a name, Helvetia's Bards shall bid thy laurels bloom; Attesting nations pay the debt of Fame, And leave to Kings the pageant of a Tomb! And should at length, beneath some Tyrant's steel, Thy Country's freedom with thy mem'ry die, From perish'd annals urge thy bold Appeal, And claim a nobler record in the sky. THE TWO FLIES. A FABLE. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LVII. 'Twas at an ancient rural seat, A country-gentleman's retreat, The usual hour when dinner ends, And people toast their absent friends. In a large Hall of antique state The Family assembled sat, Round which was seen on ev'ry side, Of Birth and Heraldry the pride; Old Ancestors in order hung, And Coats of Arms between them strung, With branching Horns from space to space, The spoils of many a weary Chace.â The cloth was mov'd, the grace was said, And on the old oak-table spread Such fruits as Summer-months produce, With sweetmeats both for show and use; Or, to describe in terms of Art, Was cover'd with a nice Dessert: While all in chat the time beguile, The 'Squire roars, the Ladies smile, The joke goes round, the glasses ring To Liberty, and Church and King. Two Flies extravagantly gay, The idle beings of a day, A false philosophy pursu'd, That Pleasure was the sov'reign Good, A doctrine which in days of yore A certain Greek had taught before. Each hour their scene of life they chang'd, New gardens, fields, and meadows rang'd, Of ev'ry flow'r enjoy'd the bloom, And wanton'd in the rich perfume. Luxurious oft they would repose On the soft foliage of the Rose, Or in the morn the dew-drops sup From the sweet Lily's silver cup; Nay, dar'd the fragrant odour seek Of Stella's lip, or Stella's cheek: Nor would one single with restrain Their Summum Bonum to attain.â Fortune, or Fate, decreed this way Our young Adventurers should stray; Who marking such delicious cheer, Resolv'd to fix their quarters here; Down on the table they alight, Indulge their taste, and feast their sight; With hasty step they walk about The scented Melon's rugged coat, Each glass they sipp'd, each plate they try'd, Then pierc'd the Peach's velvet side; Nor Cherry, Fig, or juicy Grape Could their insatiate touch escape. At length, upon a little jar Of floating Sweetmeats, from afar, Their eyes they threw, and round the rim In many a circling eddy skim; Now bolder on the border dance, And spite of Danger still advance: âTh'Occasion was not to be lost,â The foremost cry'd, âwhate'er it cost; And letting ev'ry Passion loose, He plung'd into the tempting juice.â The moral Muse must tell the rest, The tempting juice receiv'd its guest With glew'd Embracesâsuch as prove The force of Falshoodânot of Love!â There is a time when all things cloy! There's e'en Satiety in Joy!â Now fully gorg'd with his repast, He found his feet were fetter'd fast, He strove the margin to regain, But ev'ry wish and hope was vain; With new collected strength he springs, The clammy matter binds his wings, Till suffocated, clogg'd, and prest, His wanton Friend he thus addrest: âWithdraw, my brother, e'er too late, âAnd happier thou, remark my fate; âDoom'd here, my Error to deplore, âAnd from this lake to rise no more. âSorrow shall travel at his side, âWho makes not Temperance his guide! âStruck with my crime, I here abjure âThe system false of Epicure; âGo, preach it down, and render wise âThe antient Commonwealth of Flies.â He said;âthe Syrup choak'd the rest; Then swelling with a sigh his breast, He mutter'd somewhat of a pray'r, But all was buz, and lost in air; And sinking, sought those shades below Where Flies and other Insects go.â So he who rolls on Pleasure's bed, And with her garland crowns his head, Slave to her fascinating power, Still shuns Reflection's sober hour, Who roams about new Joys to meet, And greedy tastes of ev'ry sweet; Past as a dream his life shall find, Leaving no virtuous trace behind, And like our dissipated Fly, The victim of his Follyâdie!â EPILOGUE, Spoken at the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, 1758, by Miss Pritchard, In the Character of the FRENCHIFIED LADY. Boldly to lash the Vices of the Age The Comic Muse advent'rous treads the stage, She ev'ry crime that injures Virtue's cause In colours strong with daring pencil draws, And to the World holds her impartial Glass, That all may see their Follies as they pass. But yet 'tis somewhat hard our Bard to night 'Gainst one Sicilian dame should vent his spite, Because (poor thing!) she thought the French alone Had the true Taste, and ap'd it for her own, Since there's an island you will all agree, That mimics them much more than Sicily; That with this Passion stains its rip'ning fame, And far more justly might his Satire claim. In former times fair England would have scorn'd Those sons she saw in foreign robes adorn'd: Our manners were our own; a hardy Race, We built no Praise on tinsel, or on lace, Too proud in fashions Frenchmen to obey, Form'd for Originals as well as they! Slave to a mode is no free Briton's part; For Imitation is a servile art!â In vain th'affected nodâthe Nonchalance,â The snuff-box op'd with tasteâthe airy danceâ The shrugâthe cringeâthe small-talkâthe grimace, Or all th'unmeaning tortures of the face. The Briton maskâthro' each disguise he wears The plain, the downright Islander appears; And like the Ass by learned Ãsop shewn, Seems to have got a skin that's not his own.â When Carthage stood in pride of Arms elate, The haughty Rival of the Roman State, Think ye that Roman Youths, and Roman Maids Wore Carthagenian ribband and brocades? Noââdown with Carthage, and her arts!â they cry'd; And weaken'd Carthage totter'd, sunk and dy'd! NETLEY ABBEY. AN ELEGY. Horrendum Sylvis et Relligione Parentum. Virgil. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXIV. ENLARGED AND REPRINTED IN M.DCC.LXIX. TO JOHN HOADLY, LL. D. &amp;c. THIS POEM (The Subject of which adorns the Neighbourhood of his Rectory of Saint Mary's, Southampton) Is with singular Propriety, As well as particular Esteem, Inscribed By his affectionate Friend, The Author. A halcyon Calm has lull'd the wat'ry plain, Th'unmoving canvass flags beside the Mast, The gliding Bark scarce cleaves th'unruffled Main, Tho' fond Impatience bids each Zephyr haste.â Such Stillness yields the gen'ral hour of rest; Such peaceful waftage to the Saint is giv'n, When, from Life's tumults hast'ning to be blest, He meets the smile of unoffended Heav'n! Now light upsprings the breeze, the sails unfold, The ready Crew the fav'ring gale improve, The Sun-bright Current flames with waving gold, And each broad shore and forest seems to move. I hail at last these Shades, this well-known Wood, That skirts with verdant slope the barren strand, Where Netley's Ruins, bord'ring on the flood, Forlorn in melancholy Greatness stand. How chang'd, alas! from that rever'd abode Grac'd by proud Majesty in ancient days, When Monks recluse these sacred pavements trod, And taught th'unletter'd World its Maker's praise! Now sunk, deserted, and with weeds o'ergrown, Yon prostrate walls their harder fate bewail; Low on the ground their topmost Spires are thrown, Once friendly Marks to guide the wand'ring Sail. The ivy now with rude luxuriance bends Its tangled foliage through the cloister'd space, O'er the green Window's mould'ring height ascends, And fondly clasps it with a last embrace. Where burn the gorgeous Altar's lasting fires? Where frowns the dreadful Sanctuary now? No more Religion's awful flame aspires! No more th'Asylum guards the fated brow! No more shall Charity, with sparkling eyes And smiles of Welcome, wide unfold the door, Where Pity list'ning still to Nature's cries, Befriends the Wretched, and relieves the Poor! No more these hoary Wilds, these dark'ning Groves, To vocal Bands return the note of praise, Whose Chiefs (as slow their long procession moves) On the rear'd Cross with adoration gaze!â And while to neighb'ring waves, th'unwonted show, Each parting bough, and op'ning glade reveals, The awe-struck Sailor checks the hast'ning prow, Suspends his oar, and wonders what he feels.â Thus musing, oft I pace the moss-grown Isle, Each low-brow'd Vault, each dark Recess explore, While the bleak wind howls through the shatter'd Pile, Or wave hoarse-murm'ring breaks along the Shore. No other sounds, amid these Arches heard, The death-like Silence of their Gloom molest, Save, the shrill plaints of some unsocial Bird, That seeks the house of Solitude to rest. Save, when their tinkling leaders to the shade Of these cool grots, invite the fleecy Folds, Where oft the sated Ox supinely laid With lowing herds a distant converse holds! Or where the Gothic pillar's slender form (Unequal to th'incumbent quarry's weight) Deserts its post, and reeling to the storm, With sullen crash resigns its charge to Fate. While the self-planted Oak, within confin'd, (Auxiliar to the Tempest's wild uproar) Its giant branches fluctuates to the Wind, And rends the wall whose aid it courts no more. Here too (Belief could old Tradition claim) Where swells the rocky Mound in shapeless heaps, (His Name now lost, his Guilt divulg'd by Fame) Some rude Dismantler of this Abbey sleeps. Long, long in thought the patient Earth he curs'd That bore the Fabric's then unbroken Spires; Long wish'd the pow'r to bid Volcanos burst, Or call from Heav'n thought-executing fires. âWide wave (he cry'd) all bright with golden Grain âThe neighbring vales, while this proud cumbrous Mass âFor many a barren furlong chills the plain, âAnd draws with idle zeal the Crowds that pass: âNo more the Vot'ries of each time-shook pile, âAs Ruin's heirs, shall call these shades their own; âFor blazon'd Arms explore the pageant Isle, âOr search dark registers of faithless stone.â He spokeâresolv'd.âThe menac'd Arches frown'd, The conscious walls in sudden Conflict join'd, Crush'd the pale Wretch in one promiscuous wound, And left this Monument of Wrath behind.â Scenes such as these, with salutary change, O'er flatt'ring Life their melancholy cast; Teach the free thoughts on wings of air to range, O'erlook the present, and recall the past!â Here pious Beadsmen, from the world retir'd, In blissful visions wing'd their souls to Heav'n; While future joys their sober transports fir'd, They wept their erring days, and were forgiv'n. Their blameless Race succeeding, in these Cells Ere Death impos'd the lesson, learn'd to die; Alike forgot, no rais'd memorial tells In which lone spot their kindred Ashes lie! Mute is the matin Bell, whose early call Warn'd the grey Fathers from their humble beds; No midnight Taper gleams along the wall, Or round the sculptur'd Saint its radiance sheds! No Martyr's Shrine its high-wrought gold displays To bid the wond'ring Zealot hither roam; No Relick here the Pilgrim's toil o'erpays, And cheers his footsteps to a distant home!â Still Twilight now its shade advancing throws, Faint in the West the Day's last blush is seen; On Night's dim Front the Star of Ev'ning glows, And gilds with distant Beams the solemn scene. Illusion now re-peoples all the Void, From Death recalls the venerable Train (Whose thoughts no more Earth's trivial cares employ'd) To tread their ancient Bounds, and weep again. Swift as her wish th'embody'd Shades appear, O'er paths much chang'd with doubtful step they walk; Each eye rolls fast the visionary tear, And list'ning Fancy thinks she hears them talk. âSay, rev'rend Forms, in Contemplation's hour, âWhile Life serene its golden Current roll'd, âDid no kind warning, no prophetic pow'r âThis ravag'd Mansion's future woes unfold? âDid ye ne'er think the page of Joy would close? âNe'er dread a Royal Plund'rer's mighty hand? âYour exil'd Order's yet unnumber'd woes, âTheir Name extinguish'd, and their Rites prophan'd?â Silent they pass,âthen fading like a dream, To seek their lone unhonor'd Graves return; Yet fleeting they bequeath a sigh, and seem With me these violated Groves to mourn.â Yon parted Roofs that nod aloft in air, The threat'ning Battlement, the rifted Tow'r, The Choir's loose fragments scatter'd round, declare, Insulting Time, the Triumphs of thy pow'r! Shall Man, unwarn'd, survey with prescient smile Of long Futurity, the plann'd Abode?â Vain Augur, turn!âbehold where sinks the Pile A Monarch rais'd in honour of his God! Low lies that sceptred Founder's holy head, Whose virtues bade these friendly walls ascend; Applauding Angels grac'd his dying bed, And Hope's bright dawn rose cloudless on his end! Lamented Prince!âfor Mercy's task he knew, The reins of lengthen'd Empire gently sway'd; He rais'd the suppliant Tribe his Sire o'erthrew, And round his Bier each grateful Convent pray'd. Not so retir'd fell John's indignant soulâ For him no vows the doom of Heav'n oppos'd; Insulted Priesthood mix'd th'envenom'd Bowl, And Death his eyes in howling anguish clos'd. Unsteady Ruler of a nation's helm! Long struggling Freedom own'd thy hard Command; Till fierce in arms thy Barons shook the Realm, And tore THE CHARTER from thy ling'ring hand! Peace guard their dust!âtheir merits Glory crown!â Too far their worth transports the roving Muse, Who kindles at the tale of old Renown, Nor dares the Strain to Liberty refuse.â And nowâfarewel, ye Walls, ye Roofs sublime, Ye length'ning Choirs, a venerable gloom! And when, like you, your Poet bows to Time, In yon dim Cloister yield his ashes room! His hopes ne'er rose to emulate the Dead, Whose dear-bought trophies crowd the venal Fane, Where sculptur'd Mars may wreath the Coward's head, Or Truth's bright form o'er perjur'd dust complain. Midst Life's gay Scenes your calm Retreats he lov'd, Your wrested pomp his artless numbers mournâ Where led, by choice, his pensive footsteps rov'd, May Friendship place, and you protect his urn!â Could aught yet more endear your circling Wood, It is, Ardelia! unconstrain'd and free, That here, reflecting on Life's sum of good, My breast first heav'd an anxious sigh for Thee! You too, Ye Fair, of neighb'ring scenes the grace (Whose envy'd praise the Bard advent'rous seeks,) Once deign to visit this sequester'd place, Instruction's voice amidst the Ruin speaks! Whence claim they praise, these piles which strewn on Earth (A steril burthen) mock their former state? 'Tis from remembrance of their youthful Worth;â They once were beautiful!âthey once were great! Those Charms alone survive that deck the Heart, Command respect which growing years increase, Bloom when the Roses from the Cheek depart, And ebbing Life's tumultuous raptures cease! Forgive the Muse, if with presumptuous love She wooes your ears t'attend her moral Lay; Lest faithless to themselves your pleasures prove, And useless time steal unimprov'd away! For know, your bosoms feed a Flame as bright As cheers a dying Cato's latest hour; A youthful Ammon warms to lead the fight, Or lights a Julius to the goal of pow'r! Oh! trust not then the force of radiant Eyes Those short-liv'd glories of your sportive band,â Pleas'd with its Stars, though laughing Morn arise A steadier beam Meridian Skies demand! Reflect, ere (Victor of each lovely Frame) Time bids th'external, fleeting Graces fade, 'Tis Reason's Base supports the noblest Claim, 'Tis Sense preserves the Conquests Beauty made! A PASTORAL BALLAD. How wretched the Maiden who loves A Shepherd unworthy her care! From Fair-one, to Fair-one who roves, And whose Promise is lighter than Air! Such the Sorrows which poor Phillis knew, Who Colin too rashly believ'd; His aim was to triumph o'er you, Ah! Phillis, unkindly deceiv'd!â Beneath the dark Cypress she lay, And sigh'd her Complaint to the Wind âThat her Colin had wander'd away, âAnd left her despairing behind.â All cold, and stretch'd out in the shade By the Virgins, pale Phillis was found; And a scroll on her bosom was laid, Declaring, that Love gave the wound.â The Shepherds still speak of her Truth As they point out her Grave with a sigh, And upbraid thy inconstancy, Youth! Who could suffer such Beauty to die. EPILOGUE TO THE WONDER. Spoken by Violante. Our Author made a most egregious Blunder, And much presum'd, to call this Play The Wonder, Because a Woman would not to her Lover The Secret she was sworn to keep, discover; She, acting true to Character, conceal'd it; The Wonder would have been had she reveal'd it!â Is it not strange that any one should dare To think such Firmness in our Sex was rare?â Upon my life the Men are such odd fellows, They're even grown of Female Virtues jealous; And in their wise opinions seem t'agree We hold them, like Our Thirdsâby Courtesy. Our humbler Genius never ought to soar; Flirt, and coquet, we may, butânothing more!â These mighty Lords come all so learn'd from College, They grudge poor Us our little share of Knowledge!â Let them their two dead Languages still boast, We of our living one will make the most, And show them all, that we'll assert our Sway, And know our lawful Rights as well as theyâ Gallants! how scar'd you lookâthe case is clear, You keep us ignorant because you fear; But for this Art of yours, your boasted Pow'rs High as you rate them, soon would stoop to ours. Go, search in ancient, or in modern Story, What Virtues have not stampt our Sex's Glory? Blushing, you'll this assertion then believe, No Deed so great a Woman can't achieve!â Ladies, since things are thus, take this advice, Be in your choice of Men extremely nice; They are so arrogant, and so untrue, Trust them no more than you're oblig'd to do: Besides, they are all so curious, they're for knowing, Like my Don Felix, every thing that's doing; And tell a Secret to them, if they're Young, At the next Tavern it slips off their tongue; If Old, there's still as little chance 'twill keep, They doat, or doze, and blab it in their sleep. Caution'd by me, ye Fair, be this your plan, Since there's no shunning that strange Compound, Man, Like Violante, even to a Lover The Secret which he longs for, ne'er discover; Be you but firmly fix'd in this, and show it, You'll find your Swain will die but he will know it.â Never your Favors, or your Smiles dispense But to the Man of Worth, and Man of Sense; Keep the whole Race of Fools and Coxcombs under, And we must reign, or showâA Second Wonder. THE TEMPLE-STUDENT: AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND, Who had requested the Author's Opinion of a Poetical Composition. I may safely affirme, that there is nothing herein, but may either open some Windowes of the Law, to let in more Light to the Student, by diligent Search to see the Secrets of the Law, or to move him to doubt. Coke, Litt. lib. iii. cap. xiii sect. 749. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXV. Dear Sir, your Poem was receiv'd, And if a Friend may be believ'd, In Verse, (to spare a Prose Narration,) I'll say it met with approbation; And gain'd such praise as best was fitting The taste and manner it was writ in. Flatt'ry should alway stand aloof, Nor e'er approach Affection's roof, Where Honesty and Kindness dwell, And Plainness ever wishing well.â But why should you my thoughts entice? Or ask of Me, good Sir, advice? Advice! unless about receiving The certain profits of your Living, Your wrangling Parish how to tire, Or subjugate the restive Squire. No Lawyer ever loves digression, Or answers out of his Profession. Besides, I've bid the Art good-night, And vow'd I never more would write; Have long ago each Bard forsook, To read the Comments of Lord Coke, And in my Study sat me down, To doze o'er ancient Littleton; With Plowden, Fleta, and old Bracton, For sense their works benum'd to act on.â Besides, it is not quite so prudent To lure aside a Temple-Student, Who fast each vagrant thought should bind, Eject the Muses from his mind, Nor let his mortgag'd thoughts engage With Fancy's alienating page. For Evidence agrees, that he Who for a Judgeship puts to sea, Must still with utmost caution clear From the Parnassian Syrens steer, Nor stop, his steady Course to alter, At Helicon, to take in water; But chief of all each wind implore, To waft him from Cythera's shore; Where Doctors oft, a hapless Band, And shipwreck'd Lawyers, curse the sand!â Thus while the stricter watch to keep, Like Palinurus, half asleep, Each mutineer I strive to quiet, That in my Ship might breed a riot, You, with the magic of your pen, Bid Fancy's gales arise again. O! could I in some Long Vacation Slip from myself, and occupation, Whilst in the pasture of my brain A few short blades of sense remain, Which Law, that Beast, hath not yet eat on, Or with foul Trespass set his feet on: Again the banish'd Nine I'd sue, And wreath one Chaplet more for You. Your Friendship then in Verse should live; The Muse no sweeter theme could give; A Friendship springing from the heart, Not born of Int'rest, nor of Art; In numbers warmly bold, I'd raise Some kind memorial to your praise; Pleas'd, on your many Virtues dwell, And paint that worth I love so well. Thrice happy you, to whom belong The pow'rs of Harmony and Song; Who, when your long elm-walk in shade is, Can court the Nine Poetic Ladies, A favor'd Crony of them all, They come obedient to your Call. They shew their trinkets, ope their treasures, And round you dance in vary'd measures, Still charm your ear with Grecian story, Or fire your soul with Roman glory. Whilst I am doom'd to tread a way Where never Muse was seen to stray, About a trackless Waste to ride Without a way-post, or a guide, And yet oblig'd to move along, Uncertain whether right or wrong.â Come Dulness, drowsy-featur'd Fair, Slide from the Justice elbow-chair, And with thee bring such pat expressions, As thou retail'st at Quarter Sessions, When his grave Worship gives his Charge, And paints the wicked world at large; Or, when the Quorum on the Bench Are questioning some naughty Wench; Or, when Provincial Council try Their tiny wits in bastardy, Enquire about before and after, And shake the clumsy Bench with laughter, Then shrug, and nod, and wink, and leer, To see if country neighbours hear; No longer there a triumph keep, Or talk poor Jurymen asleep; But hither bend thy steps of lead, The conscious Temple knows thy tread: View the sad subject of my Cares, Mark the dread load my table bears, My papers search, and when you've done Confess me Law's devoted Son. Condemn'd to toil o'er joyless books Of Tom of Stiles and John of Nokes, The diff'rent properties to see Of lands in Tail, and lands in Fee, Or, by great dint of search discover The doctrine of Remainders over. To note what title comes to A, Expectant on the death of K, Or, in default of Issue Male, If C can enter in the Tail; And if nor A, nor C have sons, Whether the Donor's meaning runs That P, and Q, his own Right Heirs, Should then come in for equal shares.â Next, I consult the various pow'rs Of making Grants, and Wills, and Dow'rs; Learn how Joint Tenants hold together, While those In Common sell and sever. Or else I turn, with genius plastic, My eyes to Law Ecclesiastic; Read all with which sage writers load us, Of Glebe, Advowson, Tithe, and Modus. No newly-instituted Vicar Could do this needful bus'ness quicker. And, should inquiry grow more bold, I take a peep at Copyhold; Observe how Fines and Fees fall due, And how his right the Lord must sue. Nor is all this the fiftieth part Of what's to know and get by heart.â And if you touch on Special Pleading, That's of itself an endless Reading. But as a Bow that's always bent Hath soon its force elastic spent; So, lest the over-burthen'd brain (Which can't too great a weight sustain) Should not so much rich food digest, 'Tis sometimes good to give it rest. Quite jaded out, I march to Nando's, And look as grave as any man does, Shake hands with friends I wish to see, And take my sober pot of tea; Touch the light topics of the day, Ask for my letters?âWhat's the play?â Or, if I have already had 'em, Lounge at the bar, be smart with Madam; 'Tis hot, 'tis cold, 'tis dirty weather, With all such small-talk patch'd together, As modern conversations teach, And fix for standard parts of speech.â A Coffee-house serves many uses; Deep Politicians it produces; Supplies with Critic Wits the place, As Hockley breeds the canine Race. And is a general rendezvous For telling, or for reading, News.â The paper skim'd, my chat exhausted, By no fresh Comer-in accosted; I listen to some Student Posse, Who ne'er was taught Teipsum nosce, And yet in Modesty's despite, Are setting all the Judges right, Re-arguing an hour, or more, What two wise Serjeants said before. The box resounds with Lilly's Entries, Levinz,âCroke James,âand Second Ventris,â Statute of Gloucester,âPollexfen,â Popham,âSixth modern, Folio ten,â Hale,âDyer,âSalkeld,âBarnardiston,â And twenty more whose names I've mist on. My head and ears confus'd, I find One cannot here relax the Mind, In vain she strives to slip her chains, Law, Law, through all these regions reigns; So back to Chambers I return, More Patience, and more Law, to learn. Now, gentle Friend, mark well my station; Is it not chequer'd with vexation? Observe how ev'ry vagrant thought Within a narrow limit's brought, Forbidden far from home to stray, Lest back it never find its way!â Fresh toil to toil must still succeed, As one plague does a second breed! And lo! another scene is dawning, My Laundress' key announces morning, Slow turning in the rusty lock, It marks Time, sure as any clock; With iron tongue it bids me rise, And drives all slumber from my eyes. Unwilling from my bed I creep, âSix hours (say Coke)'s enough for sleep,â 'Till you're deep read, and then, mayhap, You may indulge a longer nap. The Learn'd oft nod, and shut their eyes Like Owls, and thence are reckon'd wise! Students should venerate their betters, Nor murmur at such legal fetters, Should tread the paths chalk'd out by Sages Who liv'd, and wrote in former ages; Their maxims rigidly pursue: Grey-bearded Dictums must be true!â But soon the Courts will all be set, An hour no Student should forget, Vow'd to the Law, I would not choose The smallest particle to lose; Tho' not so strict as many men, Who ev'ry affidavit pen, And minute with the same desire Whate'er is said from Bench to Cryer.â A breakfast first of Law I stuff in, Then swallow quick my tea and muffin, With ink-horn trim'd, and quill cut taper, And note-book rul'd, and blotting-paper, Looking as solemn as a Judge, Thus arm'd, to Westminster I trudge: Where fearless Front, with prating Spirit, Oft fares as well as bashful Merit, Which here so little notice draws, 'Tis rarely Council in a Cause, By most Attornies as unknown As if it ne'er had worn a Gown. Yet think not hence, he always bears The Prize, who cudgels most our ears, Or, that who aim to gain applause By jeering o'er ill-study'd Laws Success insure;âwoe to that Day, When Sound shall carry Sense away; Noâshining Genius still must rise, Rear'd by the Public's fost'ring Eyes: By shining Genius, such I mean As ev'ry now and then is seen, And, greatly soaring, puts to shame, Each petty Advocate for Fame. The Tide of Time, we daily note, Can e'en the heaviest Timber float; Cumb'rous and slow, by many a jog, At last steals on th'inactive log; Compar'd to this, quick passing by, All lighter bodies seem to fly; They to the point they aim at bound, Nor ever stick, or run aground.â 'Mongst Men such diff'rence here you see As must confirm my Simileâ But holdâthe Muses must not sport, Or touch, the Practice of the Court. No Suitor's claims are hence neglected, The Course of Law no jot affected; Dulness may prate, but ne'er prevail, Justice still holds her steady scale, Whose Beam can no false Weight obey, Whilst Independent Judges sway. What sanguine Hopes the Student please Of future Causes, future Fees, As He ascends the Steps where stand With spurce comb'd Wig, and clear-starch'd Band, Small Groups of Advocates most pliant, Peering about to find a Client, Ready their Talents to apply, Either in Law or Equity. But if th'Experienc'd you believe, E'en legal Hopes sometimes deceive. The Golden Show'r within these Walls, Like other Show'rs, oft partial falls; Some are well soak'd from Toe to Top, Others scarce get a single Drop. Hail! Rev'rend Hall! full many a Race Hast thou beheld thy Pavements pace, Who trod with Expectation here Th'unvary'd Round from Year to Year! Still blowing up their little Fire, Still vex'd that they could get no higher, How vain, how busy, sharp and bustling! The World, and one another justling! Till by degrees they dropp'd unseen, And finish'd Life's contentious Scene!â Where are the knotty Points they nibbled! The Reams of Paper that they scribbled! Where now the angry Words they sputter'd! Where the wise Sayings which they utter'd! Their Term is o'er, their Toils forgotten! They, and their Clients, long since rotten! Whilst Thou hast stood the Storm of Years, A manly Grace thy front yet wears! Thy Sides their ancient Pride sustain, Tho' scarr'd with many a mouldy stain! Angels thy Gothic Roof support, And spread their Wings o'er ev'ry Court, One hence should think all Suitors there Of heav'nly Beings were the care! Yet, Reader, be it understood, Our Guardian Angels are but Wood; Unmov'd they gaze on all below, And nothing of what's doing know: Clients in vain their Aid invoke, They're form'd of toughest Irish Oak, Which as the Nat'ralist confesses, This wish'd-for Property possesses, That greatly must to all endear them, No noxious Vermin dare come near themâ Angels in Grain! had ye the Pow'r To drop this Virtue on the Floor, It henceforth never would be pac'd By those who have its Stones disgrac'd, Attornies lost to Shame and Awe, Who spin and wind the Web of Law, Would want a Place whereon to fix, And play their Artful, Spider Tricks. No more to rouze the good Man's spleen, Would on this Pavement then be seen, The sallow, parchment-visag'd Jew, Coming to give the Devil his Due, Himself just ransom'd from a Jail, Off'ring to justify for Bail. Whilst Falshood darkens more his looks, Dauntless he kisses Moses' Books, And tho' in fact not worth five Pounds, Vows that in Hundreds he abounds; Already Bail in twenty Suits, Each Accusation he refutes, And drest in tawdriest Decay, Would swear a Registry away. Rise from the bottom of your Well, Sweet Truth, where Poets say you dwell; Tho' chill'd, and dripping wet, come here Rogues only your dread Presence fear: O'er ev'ry Court your influence stretch, And brand with Shame, the perjur'd Wretch, Whose harden'd prostituted Mind, Nor you can move, nor Oaths can bind.â When round my Rooms I throw my eye, And hundreds of huge Volumes spy, Which Sages prove, or soon, or late, Must all be search'd, if I'd be great; And then, the matter more to mend, Be ready at my fingers endâ For such a Task, I sighing say, Threescore and ten is but a Day; And ere the Bus'ness half is done, The measur'd sands of Life are run!â How oft I've heard the Parson cry, âPoor Man is only born to die;â Schismatic Lawyers change this Creed, And say, âPoor Man is born to read.â He reads indeed, and blinds his Eyes, Forgets what he has read,âand dies; Nor Coif, nor Fur, nor Seals attains, Which fed his Hopes, and mock'd his Pains: Nay worse,âno Friend to push him on, His Income spent, his Credit gone, His Mind a Stranger grown to Ease, Not more his itching Palms to Fees, Obscurely lost, he pines to Death, And clientless resigns his Breath; Doom'd e'en this Fate, perchance to meet In the sad Purlieus of the Fleet! Where grinning Scorn, and Want, deride The last Remains of humbled Pride! But hail, Posterity! for you I, Prophet-like, good Omens view. The Road our Ancestors have taken, Will shortly be by you forsaken. They journey'd through for many an Age Black-letter'd Folios irksome Page, Belabour'd up and down their Shelves, Their Quartos, their Octavos, Twelves; Oblig'd to note, turn back, collate, Perplex'd with Reference, and Date.â But Time, who laughs at such Rebuffs, And on Life's Stage the Candles snuffs, To give more Light, as Writers say, To those who sit and see the Play: Or 'twixt the Acts, like ancient Chorus, Who wise and bald appears before us, Telling the Crowd how Things are going, And what behind the Scenes is doing, Who thus oft strange Discoveries makes, Kept one incog. for your dear Sakes; Hark! he declares, you may ride post, Nor (as your Fathers were) be crost. Their thorny Paths no more will teaze you, A Turnpike's made, you'll travel easy; Ruts, Bogs, and Clays no more prevail, You'll now run glibly on the Nail. The pitying Heav'ns, who wept to see The Wilds of Law, and Equity, Where Students were so often mir'd, In which so many Wand'rers tir'd, To comfort both, with blest Intent, At last have An Abridger sent; Whose Vade Mecum, legal Olio, In Four and Twenty Volumes Folio, Affords to all a rare Repast, And boasts Variety of Taste; Fresh on your Table it appears, A standing Dish for twenty Years; Still gives your Appetite new Joy; 'Tis rich, and yet can never cloy; 'Tis like an Essence, which dispenses Multum in Parvo to the Senses; Enough can ne'er be said about it; No Templar's Rooms should be without it: Bow, Students, to this Law-refiner, And cry, âGod bless good Master Viner.â âAh! how much happier pass'd those Days, When, ravish'd by the Poets Lays, The Hours were wont too swift to fly, And danc'd in wanton Measures by. I then, transported, Hand in Hand With Spencer trod enchanted Land, While plumed Knights and burnish'd Shields, Wide glitter'd round his Fairy Fields: Or felt great Shakespeare's Pow'rs controul Each various Movement of the Soul, From Pity's source compel the Tear, Or chill my throbbing Breast with Fear, Transport me thro' the yielding Air, And place me how he would, and where. Or when, of earthly Story tir'd, To higher Knowledge I aspir'd, Through young Creation rang'd along, Imparadis'd in Milton's Song. Or pass'd intent on Themes sublime, Th'unmeasurable Bounds of Time. But now, farewell, ye flow'ry Cells, Where bright Imagination dwells, Round whom in Circles ever gay The young Ideas love to play; Farewell, to Fancy's sportive Shades! Farewell, ye sweet Aonian Maids! Receive this last Adieu from me; Go, bless some Youth whose Mind is free; Whilst I a Slave to formal Courts, To Cases, Records, and Reports, The Course I hate am doom'd to run, And if I backward turn, undone. 'Twas thus when Adam's hapless Fate Forc'd him to pass thro' Eden's Gate, He saw around a lowring Sky, Patient obey'd, yet dropp'd a Sigh; A cheerless Prospect rose to View, How chang'd from Scenes he lately knew! Rugged his Path!âfor now his Way Thro' Paradise no longer lay: Each Recollection gave him pain, But loitering he found was vain: Onward he mov'd, with Head reclin'd, Yet cast his ling'ring Looks behind.

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. AN EPISTLE FROM LADY JANE GRAY, TO LORD GUILFORD DUDLEY, Supposed to have been written in the Tower, a few Days before they suffered. Quis Regni posthac confidet viribus? aut quem Gloria decipiet Sceptri, Soliive juperbi Lubrica Majestas? ? Supplem. Lucan. lib. iv. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXII. TO The Right Honourable MARY LEPEL, Baroness Dowager HERVEY of Ickworth, Distinguished by her superior Accomplishments, as the Admirer and Protectress of every Elegant Art, THIS POEM Is with the greatest Respect Inscribed, By Her Ladyship's Obliged Humble Servant, George Keate. From these dread walls, this melancholy Tow'r, Doom'd the sad Victim of relentless Pow'r, Where ruin sits in gloomy pomp array'd, And circling horrors spread their mournful shade, I send the tribute of a short'ning life, The last memorial of a faithful Wife. For ev'ry hope on this side Heav'n is fled, And Death's pale banner waves around my head. It yet perchance may cheer my Lord to know That Suffolk's Daughter sinks not with her woe: Beneath its weight I feel myself resign'd; Tho' strong its pressure, stronger still my mind. This duty paid to Thee, each care is o'er, Nor my hard fortune shall distress me more. Yet spite of all, one anxious thought survives, For Thee, my Guilford, 'tis for Thee it lives. Yes, Thou alone with Heav'n divid'st my heart, Tho' all Heaven's due, yet Nature gives Thee part. If Love be still a crime, I'm guilty still, But to forget, depends not on our will. Affection once deep rooted in the breast, Is sometimes shook, tho' rarely dispossest; The ruling passion there in triumph reigns, It sooths my weakness, but augments my pains. O'er the dear past my roving fancy flies, And brings thy Image to my raptur'd eyes. No Mourner's weeds, no Captive's chain it wears, But bright in all its native charms appears; Such Grace, such Virtue beaming from thy brows, As stole my heart, and fix'd my virgin vows; Such as Thou wert, when at the Altar's side I gave Thee up my hand, a willing Bride: How little then expected we to find Our nuptial wreath by Death had been intwin'd! Scenes different far from these gay Hope display'd! Ah! how the false one sung, and how betray'd! Each joy she promis'd perish'd in its birth, And ev'ry flatt'ring blossom fell to earth!â But from Man's weakness still some comfort slows, 'Tis that he nought beyond the present knows; Heav'n draws a friendly curtain o'er his doom, And hides in deepest shades each ill to come.â Then be its Will ador'd, which, understood, From seeming mischief draws forth certain good. Nor in these lines suspect that I complain, Tho' mem'ry loves to trace past time again. Thus do I waste the solitary day, With tedious pace thus creep my hours away; And when the Moon, rob'd in her paler light, Revisits mortals, and directs the night, If then my weary'd strength some slumber shares, The Soul reflecting wakes to all her cares: Delusion o'er my Mind usurps command, And rules each sense with Fancy's magic wand. One moment tidings of Forgiveness brings, Descending Mercy spreads her Cherub wings; Our guards are vanish'd, ev'ry grief effac'd, We meet again, embracing and embrac'd.â O Bliss supreme!âbut too supreme to last; Ere words can find their way, the Vision's past: It fleets, I call it back,âit will not hear, And fearful shadows in its place appear. The unrelenting Queen stalks fiercely by, Fate on her brow, and Fury in her eye.â Hark! the dread signal that compleats our woes!â Hark! the loud shoutings of our barb'rous Foes!â I see the axe rear'd high above thy head,â It falls!âand Guilford's number'd with the dead. Alas! how ghastly!âEv'ry vein streams blood, And the pale corpse sinks in the crimson flood.â Could that sad form be once my soul's delight?â Quick tear the mad'ning phantom from my sight. Hold, hold your hands, ye ministers of fate, Suspend the blow, lest Mercy come too late; Let Innocence at last your pity move, And spare my Lord, my Husband, and my Love!â Northumberland! Thee, Thee could I upbraid, And bid Thee view the ruin thou hast made. This tragic picture thy ambition plann'd, And all its colours own thy daring hand. But thou art fall'n!âNor shall my parting breath Call out for Vengeance in the hour of death: I as thou wert, am to the Scaffold doom'd, Soon with my Ancestors must lie entomb'd; With the World's transient contests I have done, The hast'ning sands of Life are nearly run; A moment such as this, is not the time To blame thy weakness, or reproach thy crime! May all remembrance of thy guilt subside, And the dark Grave thy dust and frailties hide! The searching eye of Heav'n, whose wisdom darts Thro' all the mean disguises of our hearts, And ev'ry silent motive, knows alone With what reluctance I approach'd the Throne. I never sigh'd for Grandeur's envy'd rays, For regal Honours, or a Nation's praise. My bosom never felt Ambition's fire; For what exchange could Guilford's Wife desire? The bloom of May beneath our feet was spread, And all its roses deck'd our nuptial bed. With Thee conjoin'd, each social joy I found; With Thee conversing, Pleasure breath'd around. To prize the world aright, and form the mind To my lov'd books my leisure I resign'd: Or absent thou, to cheer the ev'ning's gloom, Encircled with my Maidens, ply'd the Loom. Peace was my Sister, and my Friend Content, The best Companions e'er to Mortals sent; Plac'd at my side, they tun'd their soothing lyres, And sung those carols Innocence inspires. But when, obedient to a Father's pow'r, And the last wish of Edward's dying hour, Destructive counsel! I my home forsook, Assum'd the Purple, and the Sceptre took, Swift from my sight the heav'nly Pair withdrew, And Friend and Sister bade me both adieu. Let such as, flatter'd by a pompous name, Risk their own quiet in pursuit of Fame, Beware th'exchange; awhile their purpose turn, And from a wretched Queen one moral learn. It is the cheat of ev'ry worldly joy, To tempt when distant, but possess'd to cloy; Hence flows a truth of much import, 'tis this; âContent's the highest pitch of human bliss.â Strange we should then the proffer'd boon reject! All know to seek it, yet the search neglect. To no one soil, no station 'tis confin'd, Springing, if cultur'd, in each steady mind, Far from Ambition's fiery Tract it flies, But lives with Virtue, and with Virtue dies! O had our lot by kinder Stars been thrown Beneath some lonely shade, to Fame unknown; Far from those Scenes remov'd, where Pride resorts, Far from the Cares, far from the Crimes of Courts, Unconscious of the Thorns which wound the Great, Our lengthen'd years had own'd a happier Fate: Pleas'd with our Fortune, by ourselves approv'd, Secure from Envy, and by all belov'd. Whilst, from a busy, faithless World retir'd, By no blind Folly vex'd, no Passion fir'd, Calmly we then afar had heard the Strife, The Noise, the Tumult that perplexes Life; Smil'd at Contention's visionary plan, And the vain Toils of self-deluded Man. Yet cease, my heart, these plaintive murmurs cease; For why, my Guilford, should I wound thy peace? Why with imagin'd joys thy thoughts engage, Since we are fetter'd on a tragic Stage? But say, what Tyranny can reach the Soul? What Terrors shake her, or what Force controul? Immortal as the Pow'r from whence she springs, Sick of her home, she mounts on Fancy's wings, With inborn Freedom nourish'd, spurns her chains, And roves unbounded thro' ideal scenes! Ideal joys are all I now have left, Of Thee,âa Crown,âand Liberty bereft; Torn from the pleasures of domestic Life, From each fond rapture of a virtuous Wife: By all Hope here forsaken!â'tis in vain That Reason whispers I should not complain: A sigh will heave, in spite of all my pow'rs; And sighs are due to Miseries like ours.â Ha! meet no more!âHow cruel the decree!â Heart-rending sentence!âNoâIt must not be. Down prison walls, each obstacle remove, And let me clasp once more the Man I love! One parting look a wretched Wife desires; One parting kiss the seal of Death requires!â And is there none to plead th'Unhappy's suit?â âAll ears are deaf, and ev'ry tongue is mute!â Then, come the worstâYet, howsoe'er distrest, Still shall thy Image live within my breast; My senses still that object shall pursue, And each fond wish be offer'd up for You. Tho', all unfeeling for this bleeding heart, Our Foes dismiss to Heav'n thy nobler part, Deep in the dust thy injur'd Form I'll trace, And grudge th'unconscious Grave its cold embrace.â But hold thy hand, presumptuous Woman, hold; Too warm thy passion, as thy pen too bold. Far other thoughts the present hour demands, Lo! at my side the shadowy Monarch stands; Aid me, great Teacher, this hard conflict end, Tho' King of Terrors call'd, I'll hail thee Friend! Since thou alone portray'st to mortal eyes How weak, how baseless are the joys we prize: Thou mock'st our useless toils, our mimic state, And warn'st a brother, by a brother's fate! Thy moral then shall not be lost on me, Convinc'd, my Soul approves the just decree; And unrepining quits this scene of Strife, Which points thro' Virtue to a happier Life. The Priest this morn, with ev'ry Art endu'd, Th'accursed purpose hath again renew'd; âBe ours,â he cries, âour better Faith embrace, âAnd live Preserver of your falling Race. âTho' yet misled, stand forth the Child of Rome, âThe Queen, in mercy, will avert your doom.â Merciful Queen!âYet since thus greatly kind, Tell us what mercy shall th'Apostate find? Thy royal mandate may decide our fates, But Peace alone on conscious Duty waits; Who wars against it, does the work of hell, And arms a demon he can never quell; Whose shafts receiv'd, search the wide globe around, Nor herb, nor balsam heals the fatal wound. Bear back, false Winchester, thy proffer'd Bliss, Weigh Crowns and Kingdoms with a deed like this, Far, far too light in Wisdom's eye they seem, Nor shake the scale, while Reason holds the beam.â And can the, Guilford, deem me sunk so low, So fondly wedded to this world of woe, To think her bounty would my fears entice To purchase fleeting breath at such a price? Which when obtain'd, the poor precarious toy A thousand ills might weaken, or destroy?â NoâSince I'm sworn a Sister to Mischance, Let the Clouds gather, let the Storm advance, Unmov'd, its bursting horrors I'll defy, And steady to my Faith a Martyr die. For Life's, alas! too like the transient Rose, Which oft is blasted the same day it blows; Its beauty from the wind a blight receives, Or some foul canker taints its crimson Leaves! Nor judge it hard to fall an early Flow'r, Rescu'd perchance from some tempest'uous Shower, From noxious Vapours arm'd with force to kill, The noontide Sunbeam, or the ev'ning's Chill. Howe'er the thought appal, Death's gloomy road By ev'ry mortal foot must once be trod! Deep thro' the vale of tears Man's journey lies, And sorrow best prepares him for the Skies!â O then, my Husband, I conjure thee, hear, If Suffolk's Daughter e'er to Thee was dear, By ev'ry wish of happiness to come, By ev'ry hope beyond the mould'ring Tomb; If anxious that thy better fame should soar, And shine applauded when the man's no more: Let not the wily Churchman win thine ear, Or sooth thy weakness by his fraudful care; But arm'd with Constancy's unfailing shield, As God's own soldier valiant, scorn to yield. So when Religion, stript of each disguise, In ancient purity again shall rise, To her true throne once more shall be restor'd, And rule by Reason, stronger than the Sword, Posterity our merits may attest, And our fair deeds by all good men be blest. In distant times, then shall old people tell How firmly Guilford and his Consort fell. To all their list'ning family relate, How our Faith triumph'd, tho' our Woes were great. Then shall each Youth and Maid our names revere, Grace our sad Story with a gen'rous tear, And give our dust this Requiem with a sigh, âPeace guard the Shrine where Virtue's Children lie.â O thou Supreme, on whom we all depend, Our common Parent, and our common Friend, Who deign'st to watch us from thy distant skies, Bidding the pray'rs of humbled suff'rers rise, Ruler of heav'n, stretch forth thy mighty hand, And save from civil rage my native Land. Let Rome's ambitious Sons no more prevail, Blast all their hopes, and let their counsels fail. Raise up some Prince to perfect that great plan Thy servant Edward (under Thee) began; That Error's clouds dispers'd, may ne'er return, And thy pure Light with fires rekindled burn. So Peace, sad fugitive, again shall smile, And fix her dwelling on this prosper'd Isle.â Whilst for myself one only boon I crave, Support that Fortitude thy Mercy gave; The heart thou mad'st, preserve severely just, Firm in its fate, and steady to its trust. There, whilst it beats, thy praise shall ever reign, Live, whilst it lives, and flow in ev'ry vein: Praise the sole tribute I have left to give, Nay, all a God from Mortals can receive. Come then, my Lord, my Husband, and my Love, (For Death alone those titles shall remove) With decent courage meet thy certain doom, Nor shrink with horror at the op'ning tomb. What from the Grave can Virtue have to fear? 'Tis peace, 'tis refuge from the worst despair: All strife, all human contests 'twill adjust, Nor can the hand of Pow'r insult the dust!â Religion sitting by the mourner's side Inspires that comfort which the World deny'd; And, 'midst our woes, of this one truth we're sure, Whate'er is mortal cannot long endure. Our Pains, as well as Joys, soon find an end, And, tir'd of both, we call our Shroud a Friend!â Meet it as such, my Guilford, nor thy Soul O'er-awe with fancy, or with fear controul. Think, 'twill the rigour of thy lot repay, Think, 'tis a passport to the Realms of day. On Faith's strong pinions thou shalt wing thy flight, And (the World conquer'd) with the Blest unite. The pomp of death, the Scaffold, and the Steel, The man recoiling, may an instant feel, For Nature will be heard; but be thy mind Warm with its future prospects, and resign'd.â What then remains for me?âAh! wherefore ask?â Fain would my trembling pen avoid the task; Here would it stop, nor wake thy suff'rings more, But idle Ceremony now is o'er; These tear-stain'd lines must their whole purpose tell, And bid my dying Lord a last farewell. A last! a long farewell!âOh cruel sound, It pains, it tears, it harrows up my wound. Alas! the transient dream!âDown, rebel heart,â Yet, keen their pangs that must for ever part!â A thousand, thousand things I had to say, But the fleet minutes suffer no delay. Might these fond eyes once more that Form behold, These Arms, tho' 'twere in death, my Love enfold? A Woman's weakness sure might be forgiven, And this last frailty be absolv'd by Heav'n,â 'Twas a rash wish;ânoâshun me,âfor I fear A final interview we could not bear! Ere yet a little space, this scene will close, And end the malice of our ruthless foes. Arm'd as we are for Fate, we'll die content; Fortune hath done its worst,âits Rage is spent. To happier Mansions we shall soon remove, And meet in bliss, for we shall meet Above, Crown'd with eternal Peace, we then shall own How poor the contest for a worldly Throne! No feuds, no treasons can our joys molest, Or shake th'immortal triumphs of the Blest!â And see, our wish'd-for Haven is not far, This hope shall cheer us like a guiding Star; Safe in our sea-beat Bark we'll stem the flood And spread each sail to meet the coming Good.â Descend, my Guardian Angel, from the skies, In my firm breast let dauntless Virtue rise; Loose, loose all ties that hold me captive here, And from my mem'ry blot what most was dear.â Yes, my Deliv'rer, yes, I find thy aid; Each passion's calm, and all the storm is laid. I felt its influence, Guilford, as I spoke; The complicated chain at length is broke; Life's vain Enchantments all have ta'en their flight, And Earth diminish'd fades before my sight; One last, sad, parting sigh is left for You: The rest is Heav'n's:âa longâlongâlong Adieu! TO A LADY Going to bathe in the Sea. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXV. Venus, most Histories agree, Sprang from the Ferment of the Sea; Yet I confess I'm always loth To think such Beauty was but Froth; Or, that the Ocean, which more odd is, Should from a Bubble spawn a Goddess. Tho' hence, my Laura, learned Fellows, Of such its wond'rous pow'rs still tell us, That ev'ry Mother brings her Daughter To dip in this specific Water, Expecting from the briny wave Charms which it once to Venus gave. These charms, my Laura, strive to gain; And that you may not bathe in vain I'll here, as well as I am able, Give you a Moral to this Fable. Would you a Goddess reign o'er all? From the wide Flood its virtues call; Free from each stain your bosom keep, Clear be it as this azure Deep, Which no capricious passion knows, But duly ebbs, and duly flows; Tho' sometimes ruffled, calm'd as soon, Still constant to its faithful Moon, At whose dear sight with Pride it swells, And to each Shore its chaste Love tells: Heedless of ev'ry change of weather That wafts a straw, or coxcomb-feather, Which only on the Surface play, And unobserv'd are wash'd away. Reflect, that lodg'd within its breast The modest Pearl delights to rest, Thence charms us by its virgin white, Or pours its Blushes on our sight. In Yours, thus ever may we trace Each tempting Charm, each blushing Grace; To these let Judgment value give, And in that seat of Beauty live. This Moral keep before your eyes, Plungeâand a New-born Venus rise. TO A Young LADY, Who admirably supported the Character of a Judge, at Mrs. Phipps's Masquerade in Hampshire, 1765. That Law's a dull, laborious thing All people readily allow; To love it few their minds can bring, To me, it ne'er had Charms till now. But when the Judge's look and mien, So well the sprightly Fergus hit, Quite chang'd was then this Study seen, For each man wish'd to follow it. Had Montesquieu but heard this Maid Decide so smartly ev'ry Cause, He'd not have scrupled to have said, âShe speaks the Spirit of the Laws!â TO A FRIEND, On New-Year's Day, 1766. As Rivers tow'rd th'ingulphing Ocean glide, So Time, my Friend, moves on its steady Tide: Still flowsâfor whom?âUs Loit'rers on the Shore; To all that are departed, Time's no more! In its Abimes what Myriads swept from view! The Course they took, we also must pursue.â Then, as adown its hast'ning Stream we sail, Let Wisdom waft us with propitious Gale; To Virtue yield the Helm, for when she steers We shun all dangers and avoid all fears: Beneath her guidance safe, it matters not What share of future Life shall be our lot. Enjoy the present with a cheerful Mind, Nor let aught charm that leaves a Pang behind, Should the dark Storm our Passage overcast, Hope's radiant beams shall light us to the last!â And if more years the righteous Heav'ns decree, If many circling days like This you see, Still may they happy as your wishes prove, And stronger twist the bands of Friendship and of Love! PROLOGUE, On opening of the new Theatre, at Southampton, 1766. Spoken by the Manager. As new-sprung Flow'rs rear up the tender head, And to the parent Sun their foliage spread, In us, just budding, the same action view, Op'ning, we turn with Gratitude to You. You are our Sun, You have the pow'r to raise The Theatre was built by subscription.; We feel your Comfort, and reflect your Praise. By You protected, we may here take root, Warm'd by Your smiles here too may boldly shoot; And that we more may flourish ev'ry hour, Cherish us oftenâwith a Golden Show'r. But Metaphor apart, behold in Me The Guardian of this Stage.âThis magic Key Unlocks the various scene, and brings to view, Whate'er the pens of ablest Poets drew: I shew the Living, summon up the Dead, And bid them by mine Art before you tread; Provoke your laughter, fire your breasts with glory, Or ask your tears to grace some tragic story.â As yet, you little know how great my store, Of Kings and Queens I here have many a score; Aye, and materials too for making more.â Stories of ancient Times I also trade in, Of Heroes, have a large assortment laid in, And can at will take down as best may suit us, A Cato, Falstaff, Mahomet, or Brutus.â There Pointing to the upper parts of the Stage., is lock'd up my Light'ningâthere Pointing to the upper parts of the Stage., my Thunder, My Devils here Pointing to beneath the Stage.âfor those we must keep under. Behind are Children ready to be strangled, Couples just fit in love to be entangled, Traitors that on the Rack ne'er think of pain, Virgins oft ravish'd, that quite chaste remain, Women, who tho' they're murder'd, still survive, Nay what's more strange, by often dying, thrive; Ghosts, that can eat and drink in Poison's spite, And men who bear a stabbing ev'ry night. When Comedy's your taste, I can give birth To Wit, to Satire, or good-humour'd Mirth: I've griping Fathers,âold fantastic Mothers,â Kind envious Sisters,âand designing Brothers;â Sly Knaves, who e'en their bosom-friends would cozenâ With Beaux, Coquets, and Coxcombs by the dozen; So that come when you will, you're always sure Of seeing here, the World in miniature. Whilst I, still zealous in the Drama's cause, Cherish no greater wish than your Applause. A CARD TO DAVID GARRICK, Esq. On his playing Hamlet, after his Return from Italy in 1766. From Death's long sleep had Shakespear rose, And seen Thee paint his Muse of fire, Portray so well young Hamlet's woes; What could the Poet more desire? Thine Eye the Soul's great purpose bears, With Thee we melt, with Thee we freeze; You guide our Spirits, and our Tears, And rule our Passions, as you please. ON Seeing Mrs. Garrick in a Country Dance. WRITTEN AT BATH IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXVI. Light as The Hours that round Apollo play And with gay Steps lead on the op'ning Day; Alluding to the Picture of Guido's Aurora. Amanda mingling in the Dance is seen, From all distinguish'd, smilingly serene; Each Motion's Ease, and Elegance, and Grace:â Read how she charmsâin each Beholder's Face. TO BIDDY A beautiful little Dog, which Mrs. Garrick had for many Years, well known to all her Friends, as an old, and remarkable Favorite. AT BATH. Written in 1766, after Mr. and Mrs. Garrick's Return to England. Biddy, sayâfor you have been Much abroad, and much have seen, Cross'd the Channel to and fro, Pass'd the Alps, and River Po, View'd with speculative Glance Boasted Italy, and France, Notic'd ev'ry Thing most curious, What was genuine, what was spurious; Full as good are your Remarks, As those made by travell'd Sparks; Nay, in yours I more confide, Making Nature still your Guide, On your soft, green Cushion lying, Men and Manners slyly spying, Shamming oft a cunning Sleep, Better at their Ways to peep, Nicely comb'd, and nicely curl'dâ Bid, what think you of the World?â What is all its Noise? its Strife? What the paltry Views of Life? Are they not a Flash, a Jest? But a Pantomime at best? Change of Scene, a painted Cheat, Aim'd to mimic something great? Thro' the Globe, and through each Nation All is Whim, and all is Fashion; Blockheads oft on slightest Claim Rise to Honors, Wealth, and Fame; Most Men to Self-int'rest bend, Quit their Ease to gain their End, On the Gallop, on the Fret, Something unattain'd to get! While they think no Creature sees them, Death pursuing with his Besom, Sweeps them all in little heaps, Which the neighb'ring Church-yard keeps; And thus daily clears the Stage, That new Actors may engage.â But does not your rage rise quick? As a Dog are you not sick? When you see that Men of Parts Hate a Rival from their Hearts? And keep under, or neglect Merit which they should protect? Commentators still disputing, Not with Ink, but Gall, refuting? Critic Wits their Time misusing, And their Talents in abusing? Tho' when they have spit their Spite, 'Tis not worth a Straw, who's right!â Vain are Learning's Pow'rs, but when Candour guides the Heart and Pen! When instructing, they dispense Fruits of sweet Benevolence!â Biddy, you amidst this Scuffle Han't one Care your Coat to ruffle; Pillow'd with Content and Ease, All your Aim is how to please; And to such a Wish kind Heav'n A Reward hath ever giv'n! You see none but happy Folks, Hear your Master's sprightly Jokes, View him practise all those Parts Which can chill, or melt our Hearts; Or in hours of festive leisure, Spreading Wit, and social Pleasure: Whilst your Mistress, whom each Grace Still attends from place to place, In whose cultivated Mind Ev'ry charm of Sense we find, Deigns your Merit to approve, And rewards you with her Love.â Nor will soon your Joys decay; Tho' each Dog must have his Day, At the call of Fate you'll go To Elysian Scenes below Where your Cousin Cerberus, Whose three Mouths make such a Fuss, Shall on your account stop Two, Barking soft, to welcome you, And conduct you to the Shade Where pale Proserpine array'd Sits majestic; with surprize She shall mark your Air and Size, Charm'd, her little Guest shall treat With new Teeth, new Eyes and Feet, Teach you all the puppy Tricks Play'd on t'other side of Styx, Of each fav'rite Dog get rid, Fondling only gentle Bid. THE ALPS. A POEM. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXIII. TO The Reverend DR. EDWARD YOUNG, Rector of Welwyn, in Hertfordshire: Whose Genius, Learning, and Virtues, have so long gained him The Admiration and Esteem of the Public, THIS POEM Is inscribed by the Hand of Friendship, As a Memorial of the Affectionate Regard of The AUTHOR. Bright Goddess, I obey! with rapture hear, Thy summoning voice, O Fancy, Parent sweet Of ev'ry Muse, and fairest of the Train, Who on th'Aonian Hill with ceaseless Song Inspire true Harmony.âLo! where She comes Adown yon sloping cliff with graceful step Winding a devious path, across her neck Her Lyre loose hung, and her dishevel'd hair, And Robe refulgent with unnumber'd hues, Light floating on the wind.âImmortal Nymph, These scenes are oft thy haunt, o'er Nature's works For ever ranging, various as themselves. Now Tempe charms, and now the balmy Gales That sportive play along the peaceful shore Of fertile BajÃ¦: soon thy sated eye Tir'd with their flow'ry beauties, seeks the Heath Barren and pathless, where with guilt appall'd Stalks the lone Murd'rer: Then thou rid'st the Storm, And midst the crash of Elements wakeful sit'st On some rude Rock ('gainst which the foaming Deep Breaks fearful,) list'ning to the fruitless shrieks Of shipwreck'd Mariners; or, if the Past Delight thee more, wing'st thy excursive soul To hover o'er His tomb whose loss thou mourn'st, That favour'd Child who sleeps on Avon's banks, Crown'd with eternal Fame.âO should my feet Not too unhallow'd seem, with joy I'd tread Thy steps o'er hill and vale, with thee ascend The craggy summit of yon Mountains bound In ever during Frost, or from its source Trace the free torrent to the op'ning Lake. In this wild scene of Nature's true Sublime What prospects rise! Rocks above Rocks appear, Mix with th'incumbent clouds, and laugh to scorn The proudest boasts of art. In fleecy snow Some mantled, others their enormous backs Heave high, with forests crown'd; nor midst the view Are wanting those who their insulting heads Barren and bleak, uprear as in contempt Of vegetative laws. Nor yet are they Unfruitful, deep within their quarries lie The Marble various vein'd; and the rich Ore Winds its slow growth: nor here unfrequent found The Crystal, catching from its min'ral bed A changeful tinge, yellow, or red, or green, Azure, or violet; wanting strength alone To be the gem it mimics. On these heights Blooms many a modest flowret scarcely known E'en to the vale beneath, tho' sweet as those That, when proud Rome was Mistress of the World, Adorn'd the shrines of Flora. Many a shrub Of sov'reign use, and medicinal herb Spread forth their humble leaves, by careless foot Of shepherd trampled, till some chance disclose Their latent virtues. Heaven, to sooth the ills Which sap this mortal Frame, hath strew'd the Earth With Plants like these, nor from its Children here Withheld its hand. The trickling Rill presents Slow bubbling out a salutary Draught, With Ore impregnated, its mazy path Tinging like gold; others or warm, or hot, Sulphureous, form a strength-restoring Bath In nooks impervious to the mid-day Sun.â Here the fleet Roebuck darts, as thro' the woods The hunter's horn re-echoes; Here the Wolf Prowls savage, shunning, save by want compell'd, The haunts of Men: tardy and cautious moves The cumbrous Bear; the fearful Lev'ret too In his white hue confiding, on the snow Rests fearless and unmark'd; while o'er the cliffs Most rude, and cas'd by winter's icy hand, Wild as the scene he loves, the Ibex A species of Wild-Goat inhabiting the coldest parts of the Alps. bounds. From this proud Eminence Europa pours Her amplest Rivers down, whose gentle springs Or on the Glaciers, or St. Gothard's top, Or midst the Grisons complicated states First rising, swell with many an added stream, And in their passage Provinces remote Adorn and fertilize. From hence along The Plains of Lombardy the rapid Po, With haste impetuous, rushes on to meet The Adriatic. Raging as he goes, O'er intercepting rocks the Danube rolls With many a River leagu'd, eager to seek The distant Euxine. The tumultous Rhone, Mingling its waters with the Leman lake, Precipitates its course thro' cities fair And purple vineyards, till the sea ingulph Th'augmented torrent. Here the double Rhine Blends its twin streams yet slender, and from Coire In circuit sweeps to Constance, then adown The rugged cliffs of Lauffen furious pours The boiling Cataract, The famous fall of the Rhine. with thund'ring roar Far echo'd: in its dashing fall the Foam Snatch'd by the eddying winds, disperses round A misty Show'r. The Empire now It skirts, Wide and more wide expanding, and (too just An emblem this of human glory) sinks In Belgic sands, unnotic'd, and forgot!â Here smaller Fountains ope their gelid stores, And Springs unnumber'd burst, but who can search Their secret sources? to recount their names Were task too hard. Yet in my verse shall flow The winding Russ, the far resounding Arve, The Adda much distain'd, the wandring Aar, And the bright Tessin's clear tho' rapid stream. These as they glide along survey their banks With mountains circled that appear to bend Beneath the woods they bear. The mournful Larch Its drooping foliage hangs: the stately Pines, Their boughs together mix'd, in close array (Wedg'd like the ancient Phalanx,) from the axe Rear their tall heads secure; on craggy cliffs Rooted, or over Precipices dread Waving their umbrage broad: while other Hills, Tho' painful their ascent, spread their steep sides Rich in the gifts of Ceres, where the plow Might seem a stranger; yet the barren Rock. That but a quarry shews, on its wide top Expands fair pastures, where the Villager, What time the Snow beneath the vernal Sun Dissolves, leads up his flocks, to pass the heats In rural cares, 'till the dark short'ning day, And the rough blast, which herald-like precedes Th'approach of winter, warns him to the Vale. Lo! where yon Summits court our steps, how wild The rocky path! now their rude points reflect The darting Sunbeam, and anon are lost In clouds and passing vapours!âTheir ascent Must not affright; Nature like some coy Fair, Spreads not her Charms at once, but hides them half From timid Gazers.âOn thy Brow, Saleve A high Mountain about four or five miles distant from Geneva, rising perpendicularly above the Arve, and commanding a delightful view of the Lake, and the different Countries that lie round it., (Thy well-known Brow, that hath so often woo'd My pensive mind) I catch with greedy eye Th'enchanting Landscape, beyond fiction fair; Where towns, and castles lie dispers'd, and woods, And ruddy vineyards, where its proudest boast, Geneva's Turrets rise; and yon blue Lake A far-stretch'd mirror spreads: its Bosom shews Th'inverted prospect, circled in with hills And cliffs, a Theatre immense!âBut this No peril wears to him who dares attempt The Glaciers slippery track, or climbs the Steeps Of Tourne, or St. Gothard, or hath join'd The toiling passengers o'er Cenis Mount, Or great St. Bernard: Scarce the aching sight Sustains the view, Rocks beyond Rocks arise, In ever varying shapes. There piles of Snow And dashing Cat'racts chill; here a thick Mist Steals on us while we gaze, and all below Like one wide Ocean shows!âIt breaks,âit fleets,â A new Creation bursts upon our sight, Clear and more clear emerging: Now distinct On the far Plain behold the lab'ring Ox, The busied Husbandman, and shepherd Boys Tending their fleecy fold.âFrom heights like these How little they appear!âdiminish'd!âfaint!â Nay all beneath how small!âNor will the Muse, Best-heard instructess, in her verse forbear To wreath the moral layâSo looks the World To him whose philosophic mind hath curb'd Its visionary hopes; as he ascends The rock of Virtue, all Life's envy'd toys, Lov'd, nay, ador'd before, shrink from the sight; Pausing, he wonders they could charm so long, Then to the senseless Pageant bids farewel! Thrice happy Regions! could we mount the Winds And post around the Globe, where should we find A calmer dwelling? While destructive War, With Discord leagu'd, rings her infernal peal And fires the mad'ning Crowd, thy Vallies hear No sounds but those of Peace; fecure the Swain Bears plenty to his fields, nor fears a foe Shall reap the harvest.âItaly may boast Its rip'ning Sun, its azure Skies;âhow sweet Are Arno's fruitful Banks!âhow proudly smile Thy Hills, imperial Florence!ânor to me Unknown thy Myrtle Shades, thy Orange Groves, Parthenope The ancient name of Naples.: yet far more pleas'd I range These Scenes romantic, by th'endearing voice Of Liberty allur'd. Here reigns Content, And Nature's Child Simplicity, long since, Exil'd from polish'd realms. Here ancient Modes And ancient Manners sway; the honest Tongue The Heart's true meaning speaks, nor masks with guile A double purpose: Industry supplies The little Temp'rance asks; and rosy Health Sits at the frugal board.âIf banish'd hence Be Luxury, and all the finer Arts Which swell her train, say, Tenants of these Climes, What lose ye?âRather tell how great your gain.â No Grandeur, plac'd beyond your reach, torments, No splendid objects light Ambition's fire, Or point the stings of Envy. What but these Fill Courts with sighs? and lay such aching heads On beds of state?âBy these, vain Man misled, Restless, pursues imaginary joys, Which melt in air, and mock his grasp, nor stops Till Death unfold his error; happier ye Tread unaffected Wisdom's paths, and share Life's real blessings. Fortune's niggard hand Withholds in vain, those treasures which she pours Lavish to others, Heav'n o'erpays the loss, And gives you minds superior to her charms. Whene'er Affliction visits, she calls forth Virtues that from the Sunshine of Success Shrink their diminish'd pow'rs; severely kind Her lessons! ye have heard her chast'ning voice, Ye brave Helvetii; tho' the olive wreath Has long adorn'd your annals, time hath been When blood hath stain'd them red; when Civil Strife, Waving its crimson Banner, call'd to arms, And bade the Furies who await its nod, Spread Desolation.âOft your little States Have shook with danger, felt the hostile foot Of foreign Legions, felt th'oppressive yoke Of tyrant Rule; then were ye dauntless seen, Zealous to curb the insolence of Pow'r, And claim what Nature gave.âFrom Morat's Plain What glorious Laurels sprung It was at this place that, 1476, Charles le Hardi, last duke of Burgundy, was defeated by the Swiss. The splendor of the great army he commanded, is mentioned by Historians as very remarkable.! when the rich Spoils Of routed Burgundy bestrew'd the dust, And harness'd Knights in many a glitt'ring heap, Magnificent in ruin, press'd the field: Vain were their vaunted arms, the rising Sun Now shew'd those faces pale, which erst had glow'd With fond presage of Conquest!âBut if love Of old Renown survive, here yet remains A nobler Monument to charm: Come ye Whose souls can feel for others, come and tread In luxury of thought, the woody sides Of Lucern's Lake, that washes with its streams States not unknown to Fame. Tho' the sight meet Nor trophy'd Pillar, nor the Victor's Arch, (Sad register of slaughter!) we may view A soil that nurtur'd Heroes: Men who dar'd, Spite of Tyrant's menace, to throw off Chains that disgrac'd their Country, and restore Its Happiness with Freedom. Yes, my Muse, Partake this Country's transport, let the tear Steal from thine eye as thou record'st the names Of Melchtal, Furst, and Stauffach The three Heroes who planned the Liberty of Switzerland; of whom sufficient mention hath already been made in the Preface to The Helvetiad.; now indulge The grateful Ardour, as thou read'st the Tale In Sculpture rude, or on th'Historic wall Which artless hands have cloath'd. The task is thine To sing the brave, and lift th'aspiring Soul To deeds of brightest Fame. Entranc'd I'll fit Upon Mongarten's hill, and as I view The spot by Valour memoriz'd, hear Thee tell The high achievements of these Patriot Chiefs, And the scant Troops they led; hear thee describe 'Gainst what a Host they fought, how firm they stood, To Death determin'd, this important Pass, Their bulwark, to defend, and how repuls'd, Presumptuous Leopold, by thousands back'd, Retir'd an abject fugitive, dismay'd To find what noble Minds by Justice rouz'd Can dare for Liberty.âHence shrunk the sway Of humbl'd Austria; Hence the various leagues Which bind these realms of Brothers, Hence the smile Each conscious visage wears!âIllustrious Shades! Long, long enjoy the honours ye receive From this confed'rate Land, teach it to prize The blessings ye bequeath'd, and give them pure To late Posterity. In times remote, Enamour'd of your worth, some Bard perchance More equal to the Theme, shall rise, and give Your Names the lasting Triumph they demand! Amidst these Scenes stupendous, where the Soul Feels all her faculties in wonder lost, Contemplative I'll roam thro' winding walks Of shadowy Pines that court the breeze, and hear The Torrent down its stony channel sweep With terror-striking roar: nor would I fail At dewy Eve to wander, when the Sun To his pale Sister's milder rule resigns The cloudlesss Skies, who as she rises, spreads Her silver beams, and the snow-mantled tops Of yonder mountains with a yellow Hue Faint tinges, one expanded Sheet of light Dissusing: while the Shades from rock to rock Irregularly thrown, with solemn gloom Diversify the whole.âThis tranquil hour, This awful silence, Meditation's due, Forbids the mind to view with careless eye Creation's works, or uninstructed gaze. Yet Nature smiles not always: there are times When her Throne totters, and her ancient Realm Shakes from its deep foundations. Hollow blasts Heard from the turbid West, proclaim at hand The Alpine Tempest.âAll the dark'ning air A gloomy silence holds, and clouds surcharg'd, Press lab'ring 'gainst the Mountain's side; alarm'd The Swain in haste seeks shelter, nor too soon, For the Storm bursts.âLo! where along the vale A dusky Vapour sweeps, and on its wings Rides Devastation.âNow the op'ning Skies Pour forth a deluge, Rivers break their bounds, And Torrents swell:âDown rolls the tow'ring Oak From its high cliff up-rent, and the deep voice Of Thunder roars tremendous, echo'd back From Alp to Alp, and distant dies away In faint, low murmurs:âNight perhaps at last Augments the Horror, greater deem'd, from sight Each object shut; save while the transient Glare Of the red Light'ning shoots, or where its fires Have on a hill remote in ruin wrap'd Some lonely Cottage: Meteor like, the gleam Darts thro' the void; pale the sad Owner stands, Himself scarce sav'd, and mourns his little All: In vain! leagu'd with auxiliar winds, the Storm Howls loud, and wafts the ruddy blaze to Heav'n. Far other views chill Winter's hand displays, When o'er the plains, and o'er the rocks, he spreads His hoary mantle; when the thick'ning Air Descends in feather'd Flakes. Each prospect round How wild! how shapeless!âNow, Streams wont to flow With hasty currents, lazy creep, beneath Th'incumbent Snow. The tall Fir's loaded branch Waves like the Ostrich plume; the fleecy show'r, Whirl'd in its falling, forms unreal hills, And faithless Levels.âCautious be his steps Who thro' these regions journeys while they wear Their cold and dreary aspect, left the Beam Of some air-kindled Vapour, streaming low Its lucid exhalation, should mislead The Traveller night-wand'ring, like the Star That bright above the Arctic Circle yields A seeming friendly ray, but only serves To light the frozen Pilot to his fate.â Nor let him unadvis'd the sloping side Of the steep Mountain climb, lest from above The snowy Piles o'erwhelm him; This ball or mass of Snow is called the Avalanche; it is frequently of a prodigious size, and rolls from the Alps in particular seasons, rendering the passages very dangerous. Historians who have written of these countries, mention innumerable instances of the ravages and mischiefs produced by it. frequent now, At dead of Night, remote their sullen sound Strikes on the startled ear.âNor scarce more safe In the broad eye of Day the passage lies, Looking Security: by eddying winds Or agitating sounds, It is the commonly received opinion in these countries, that any sudden agitation of the air, such as the firing a gun, loud shouting, &amp;c. will at certain times occasion the Avalanche. the loosen'd snow First mov'd, augmenting slides, then nodding o'er The headlong-steep, plunges in air, and rolls With one vast length of Ruin to the vale.â Aghast beneath it the pale Victim sees The falling Promontoryâfeesâand dies!â Amidst its horrors from the house of Death Let me recall one true, one wretched Pair, To the cold Tomb untimely sunk. The Tale I've heard from Shepherds, as they pointed out The spot their story noted, and have dropt For hapless Love a sympathizing tear. In a lone Vale, wash'd by th'impetuous Arve, Beneath the shade its tallest mountain threw, Matilda dwelt; the sole remaining hope Her ancient Father knew, whose fruitful fields, Cover'd with Flocks and Herds, spread wide around. Her's was each blushing charm which Youth can boast Or Nature's hand bestow; bright as the bloom Of May, and mildly sweet as the soft gales Whose vernal wings fan the first op'ning Flow'rs: Nor was her mind less fair!âEach neighb'ring Swain Had sigh'd and languish'd, on the tender bark Inscrib'd Matilda's name, or to her ear Whisper'd his love,âin vain!âNone, none were heard Save young Rodolpho, whose prevailing form Had won her to his favour: on his brow Sat native comeliness, and manly Fire O'er all diffus'd its lustre. Yet with her His gen'rous mind most sway'd, where shone each thought That Delicacy knows, far more refin'd Than suits the happy!âMuch he had convers'd With rev'rend Age, and learn'd from thence to prize A rural Life; learn'd to prefer the Peace Of his own woods, to the discordant din Of populous cities.âWhat but Fate could bar Their wishes?âluckless Fate!âThe morn was fix'd To seal their plighted faith, the Bridegroom rose With all a Bridegroom's transport, call'd his Friends To join the festive train, and hasten forth To greet th'expecting Maid; still as he went Anticipating Fancy's magic hand The thousand raptures drew which youthful breasts Feel at approaching bliss.âAlas! how quick Treads Woe in Pleasure's footsteps!âNow pursue The fated Youth, tho' words are far too weak To speak his horror, when, nor well-known Farm, Nor wonted Flocks he saw, but in their place A pond'rous Mound of snow.âAt early Dawn From the near Alp the cumb'rous Ruin fell, And crush'd her Father's roof. To lend their aid Th'assembled Villagers were met, and now From the cold mass had brought once more to light Th'ill-starr'd Matilda; lovely still!âfor still A blush was on her cheek, and her clos'd eye Shew'd but as Sleep. Around her head she wore Her bridal Ornaments, deck'd as she was To wait the nuptial hour.âAh! deck'd in vain, The Grave thy Marriage bed!âOn the sad Scene Rodolpho gazes, stands awhile aghast, The Semblance of Despair; his swelling breast, Torn by conflicting Passions, from his tongue Utt'rance withholds. He rolls his haggard eyes On all around, as he would ask, if e'er Griefs such as his were known?âThen o'er the dead A moment pausing, on her lips imprints A thousand frantic kisses, her cold hand With ardour seizes, and in broken sounds Calls on Matilda's name.âWith that last word The struggling soul a passage finds, and down He sinks in Death, pale as the ambient snow!â Tho' Perils wait the Foot that o'er these Heights Pursues its path, yet Charity hath strove To sooth their rigour, and supply those aids The ruthless scene denies. Amid the wilds See where the cloyster'd Hermit opens wide His hospitable gate On some of the mountains there are Convents and Hospitals for the relief of such Passengers as want assistance. to welcome in The sick'ning Pilgrim, and afford Repose To the way-weary Stranger, who partake The profser'd bounty; then renew'd in Strength, Departing, bid the pious Mansion peace! Here, Fancy, my conductress, let us rest, Enough our toil, for we have trodden paths New to the Muse. Yet ere thy hast'ning wings Are spread for other Climes, here sit awhile, Glance o'er the Wonders of this various Land, And take one farewell look.âThe active Mind What can controul? free as the vagrant Air, It scorns all bounds, and darts into the Shades Of dim Futurity!âE'en while I gaze On you, ye Mountains wild, ye sky-crown'd Rocks, Sublimely great, that have defy'd the waste Of rolling Ages, brav'd so many Storms, Unhurt, unshaken, in the Round of Time, I view your period; when internal War Rends your Foundations, when your Mines shall flame, And your Volcanos bursting from beneath Spread wider Conflagration.âThen your Woods Shall blaze with horror,âThen your lofty Heads Smould'ring consume, and like the Snows they bore All sink dissolv'd!âWhere are the Rivers now That water'd Europe? where the thousand Streams, The thousand Fountains, and ten thousand Rills, Your Caverns nourish'd?âRather might I ask, Where is the Ocean?âWhere the mighty Deeps That girt this pendent Globe?âWhere the firm Earth, Or changeful Moon?âFor when your strength shall fail, Ye Hills coeval with the World, say what Shall scape the gen'ral Doom?âThrough all its works The Universe itself shall feel, and sigh For Dissolution. Chaos then once more Shall reign triumphantâgrace your Fallâand round Your noble Ruin pour substantial Night. EPILOGUE TO THE Dramatic Romance of CYMON. Spoken by Mrs. Abington, At the Theatre-Royal in Drury-Lane, 1767. Enter, peeping in at the Stage-door. Is the Stage clear?âbless me!âI've such a dread! It seems enchanted ground where'er I tread! (coming forward.) What Noise was that?âHush!â'twas a false alarm;â I'm sure there's no one here will do me harm: Amongst you can't be found a single Knight, Who would not do an injur'd Damsel right.â Well,âHeav'n be prais'd, I'm out of Magic reach, And have once more regain'd the pow'r of Speech: Aye, and I'll use itâfor it must appear That my poor Tongue is greatly in arrear.â There's not a Female here but shar'd my woe, Ty'd down to Yes, or still more hateful No. No, is expressive,âbut I must confess, If rightly question'd, I'd use only Yes.â In Merlin's walk this broken Wand I found, Which to Two Words my speaking Organs bound. Suppose upon the Town I try his spell,â Ladies, don't stir!âyou use your Tongues too well! How tranquil ev'ry Place, when by my skill, Folly is mute, and even Slander still! Old Gossips speechlessâBloods would breed no Riot, And all the Tongues at Jonathan's lie quiet! Each grave Profession must new-bush the wig, Nothing to say, 'twere needful they look big! The Reverend Doctor might the Change endure, He would sit still, and have his Sinecure! Nor could Great Folks much hardship undergo, They do their Bus'ness with an Aye, or No!â But come, I only jok'dâDismiss your Fear; Tho' I've the Pow'r, I will not use it here. I'll only keep my Magic as a Guard, To awe each Critic who attacks our Bard. I see some Malcontents their fingers biting, Snarling, âthe Ancients never knew such writing;â âThe Drama's lost!âThe Managers exhaust us âWith Op'ras, Monkies, Mab, and Dr. Faustus!ââ Dread Sirs, a word,âthe Public Taste is fickle, All palates in their turn we strive to tickle; Our Cat'rers vary, and you'll own at least, It is Variety that makes the Feast. If this fair Circle smile, and the Gods thunder, I with this Wand will keep the Critics under. A LITTLE ODE, TO A LITTLE MAID, On her first going out after her Birth. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXVII. Little Zephyrs, Loves, and Graces, Bid each chilling wind be laid, Shelter'd in your warm embraces, See where comes my little Maid. With your guardian-wings protect her, Ev'ry motion hover o'er; Through her little Path direct her, She ne'er ventur'd out before. Forth she comes, a new-born Creature, How her little blue Eyes range! Wonder fits on ev'ry Feature, All around is gay and strange. Could'st thou, little Maid, but paint me What thy little Fancy warms, Or thy little Tongue acquaint me, 'Midst this glitter, what most charms. To a Stranger all's inviting, All a morning Beauty wears; Be the World, as now delighting, Taste its Joys, but not its Cares! Over these I draw a Curtain, Leave their sad approach to Chance; Not a Truth than this more certain, âBliss is built on Ignorance.ââ Pity, gentlest Child of Heav'n, Little Maid, will Thee attend; Innocence is also given As thy Guardian, as thy Friend: She shall wake thine heart to Pleasures Such as Virtue can disclose; Give Thee Love and Friendship's treasures, Strew thy Path with many a Rose. As in Years, in Wisdom growing, Never from her side depart; Through thy future Life still showing She had form'd thy youthful Heart. Let the false World ne'er confound Thee, From its Vices turn thine ear; Shun the bad Examples round Thee, Give them but a Sigh!âa Tear!â Thus self-guarded, thus defended, Thy Experience shall confess, Spite of what's by Fools pretended, Virtue is true Happiness! Such a blameless Tract pursuing, Thy perfection'd Sense shall tell, Oft this little Ode reviewing, Little Maid, I wish'd Thee well. TO A LADY, With a present of a Stilton Cheese. WRITTEN FROM THE TEMPLE, M.DCC.LXVII. These hasty lines, Madam, were first meant to greet you, And then for a Favour will humbly intreat you, Nay, hang all preambleâI plainly will ask it, They're to beg you'll accept of the Cheese in this basket. A Cheese for a Lady's an odd present truly! And you'll think that we Templars have ne'er study'd duly The Cases of Gallantry, or never saw What the ablest of Judges have laid down as Law; In Cupid's Reports, folio seventy-six, Under Title Presentment this Doctrine they fix, âIf some token you'd offer the Fair, you should seek, âOr the Rose, or the Lily, to rival her cheek, âOr send her a Myrtle, or send her a Dove, âAs the emblem of Truth, or the image of Love.ââ This may sometimes be right,âbut to further my suit I've a Case on my Table that none can confute, Brother Bayes has inform'd us, when Pallas came down To befriend the Usurpers who stole Brentford's Crown, When to Grief and Despair they were ready to yield, She produc'd them a Cheese she had brought in her shield See the Play of the Rehearsal..â Tis so fully in point, that with this thought I'll close, âSure that must be good which a Goddess bestows.ââ Nor be you offended she ne'er sent you one, Consider what for you already is done; If when in her Dairy, her Cheese she forgot, Enough of her Favours are thrown to your lot. Whilst you use them discreetly, you'll ne'er fail to please And I'll still, as her proxy, transmit you the Cheese. TO ARDELIA, On her producing some Essence of Roses. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXVII. Whilst you boast your Essence of Roses, By your Friends, tho' its Fragrance be tasted, With its sweets you enrapture their noses, Yet nought of its Substance is wasted. It resembles the poor Widow's Cruise, Which the Prophet had fill'd with his Blessing, Replenish'd, tho' always in use, And still the same Virtue possessing. 'Tis thus with a well-tutor'd Mind, Bright Thoughts and fine Sense it discloses; Tho' pouring its Sweets on Mankind, Undiminish'd remains as your Roses. Happy you! who this Mystery knowing, Have such vary'd Talents to bless; Can Pleasure be ever bestowing, And giving, have nothing the less! A POEM TO THE MEMORY OF THE CELEBRATED Mrs. CIBBER. ? SidereÃ¦ Raptus lugebat AlumanÃ¦. Claud. de Rap. Prof. Lib. iii. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXVI. What visionary Form on yonder Heaps Of Earth, sits hov'ring o'er a new-made Grave, In this dim Cloister painful Vigils keeps, And wild with frantic Sorrow seems to rave? The Sexton's Lamp still glimmers: On the ground Each instrument of Sepulture is thrown, And near her many a Bone lies scatter'd round, The mingled Reliques of a Race unknown! Long flows the Veil, whose Shade conceals her Face; Now high as yon proud Roof her Groan ascends; Now bursting Tears her silent Sorrows grace, Now low in Dust the heart-struck Mourner bends. âSay, Grief's sequester'd Victim, whence thy Woe? âWhy heaves thy Breast beneath this Load of Care? âWhy thus the haunts of cheerful Life forego? âAnd in these lonely Mansions seek Despair? âIt is the Cause,âIt is the Cause,â she cries, âWill not this Scene the fatal Story tell? âLearn from yon Train the Tale my voice denies, âOr ask the Summons of that pausing Bell? âIt calls my Cibber to her House of Clay, âWho now no more our Passions will engage; âRich in Theatric Glory, snatch'd away, âThe darling Daughter of the British Stage. âShe comes, my Juliet comesâO cruel Force!â âTorn from my Arms by Heav'n's relentless Doom.â âNow chang'd indeed!âAn undissembled Corse! âToo soon to fill an undissembled Tomb!â I turn,âMy eye the length'ning Cloister roves, Thick flaring Tapers pour upon my Sight; With solemn Pace the black Procession moves, And wrapt in tenfold Darkness frowns the Night. Sorrowing, I see the holy Rites begin; Resign'd, the sad sepulchral office hear: A thousand soft ideas stir within, And ask once more the tributary Tear. But when (the sable Robe of Death remov'd) In Earth's cold Womb the sad Remains were laid; Let those whose eyes have stream'd o'er all they lov'd, Conceive the anguish of this nameless Maid! Eager she sought to catch a parting Look, Fix'd in expressive Silence o'er the Dead: Then sighing deep, the drear Abode forsook, And thro' the monumental Region fled. âMight I, thou gen'rous Friend, that Face behold! âCan'st thou a Partner in thy Tears refuse? âCan'st thouââ but while her Robe I strove to hold, Her falling Veil disclos'd the Tragic Muse. âDivine Melpomene! art thou,â I cry'd, âFrom Fancy's Regions drawn, this Train to join? âTut'ress of virtuous Grief, why seek to hide âSorrows, which claim Preeminence o'er mine? âYes,â she reply'd, âfrom happier Realms I came, âTo see my Cibber laid in hallow'd Rest; âBy her, to noblest Heights I rais'd my Fame, âBy her, enlarg'd my Empire in the Breast. âMy Thoughts must still the plaintive Theme pursue, âHer fond Remembrance ever there remain; âE'en now her wond'rous Pow'rs rise fresh to View, âAnd point Reflection's Dart with keener Pain! âClos'd are those Eyes which knew each vary'd Art, âAnd all my Meaning with such Force inspir'd; âCall'd Tears of Pity from the melting Heart, âFroze with wild Horror, or with Rapture fir'd! âBy Death's cold hand those Features now are bound, âThat once could ev'ry change of Passion wear! âMute is that Voice, whose more than magic Sound âStole like soft Music on the ravish'd ear! âThose Limbs are fix'd, in funeral weeds array'd, âWhich boasted once each Elegance of Dress, âAnd all those captivating Charms display'd, âThat grace the Sculptures of exulting Greece!â âWhat Suppliant now shall haughty Pyrrhus bend? âWhat tender Wife of faithless Jaffier melt? âWhat Daughter Softness to Cordelia lend? âWhat Mother feel the Pangs that Constance felt? âWhat false Calista shall bewail her Fate? âWhat poor, deceiv'd Monimia now complain? âWho, Isabella, can thy Woes relate? âOr heat to giddy Whirls Alicia's Brain?â âO gentle Cibber! long thy Loss I'll mourn; âAnd oft at night, by strong Affection led, âTo this lone Place with grateful Tears return, âAnd o'er thy Dust ambrosial Odours shed!â âYet am I not of ev'ry Hope bereft; âNor stifled in the Tomb my Taper dies; âStill to relume the Blaze a Pritchard's left, âWhose Breath shall send it flaming to the Skies. âFrom Judgment's aid its value Genius reaps, âCorrect as Nature, hence her Scenes engage; âWhether Cresphontes' humbled Queen she weeps, âOr rolls the Thunders of a Zara's Rage. âBut yet while fondly thus her Pow'rs I praise, âIn these she bids a happy Rival share; âToo frequent from my Cypress Groves she strays, âNor scorns Thalia's humbler Wreaths to wear!â âO may she long retain her wonted Fire!â âNor Shakespear Garrick's Aid in vain implore! âFor ah!âWhen these content with Fame, retire, âThe Tragic Muse, like Cibber, is no more!â THE FAN. TO ARDELIA. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXVIII. Go, Trifler, and speed to my Love, Propitious, go practise thine Art; Thou may'st haply an Advocate prove, And tell how she reigns in my Heart. As thy Sticks the gay Colours they bear, Unfold with the Touch of her Hands; So my Breast, when I muse on my Fair, With each Wish of Affection expands.â From her a new Grace shall be caught, Go, seize it, and prosperous be; But fan in return each kind Thought That Ardelia bestows upon me. A FAREWELL EPILOGUE; INTENDED FOR Mrs. PRITCHARD At her last Appearance on the Stage, after the Play of Macbeth, which she had for her Benefit, the 25th of April 1768. The following Lines were written at the Request of Mrs. Pritchard; but Mr. Garrick having, unknown to her, composed some on the same Occasion, which he had offered to her before these were sent her, the Author immediately withdrew them, that she might be at perfect Liberty to receive this last Favor from her celebrated Cotemporary, whose very uncommon Theatric Powers had, as well as her own, for so many years reciprocally set off and embellished each other's Talents. As Pilgrims parting for another Land Turn back, and bless the hospitable Hand That smooth'd th'uneven Way; like them I now Turn, and to all my gen'rous Patrons bow.â The Queen deceas'd, my mimic Life is o'er, In borrow'd Character I come no more, The Scene at length is clos'd!âThe Voice of Age Warns me to quit the Tumult of the Stage; This little Spot, where almost Forty Years I have my Portion had of Plots, and Cares.â What strange Vicissitudes I here have known! Now high on Fortune's Wheel, now tumbled down; Bound to my Tragi-comic strange Vocation, I've daily chang'd my Time of Life, and Station.â One Night a fashionable Toast I shine, The next some waiting Woman's Lot is mine; Then chang'd again, I rise the grave Coquet, And all the flippant Abigail forget; Doom'd thro' each varying Character to pass, And for its Likeness dress at Nature's Glass.â O'er almost ev'ry Kingdom here I've reign'd; Here have to Rocks, and Prison Walls complain'd. When I recall (by adverse Fortune crost) The Husbands I have bury'd!âChildren lost!â The vast Variety of Woes I've prov'd! How oft been cheated,âflatter'dâslightedâlov'd! Marry'd,âdethron'dâfelt ev'ry kind of Death!â I almost wonder I have still my Breath; Nay,âthat I throve so wellâand now stand here To own your Bounty with a gushing Tear.â That gushing Tear what I now feel must tell, Severe the Task to bid you all farewel!â Your fost'ring smiles first warm'd me to aspire, Worn in your service, grateful I retire; No longer this fair Circle shall I see! The Falling Curtain separates you and me! Yet if with Justness I have play'd my Part, If for the Public I have strain'd my Art, That Public's Candour nothing shall efface; And may its Plaudit, my last Exit grace! Mrs. Pritchard did not live above five Months after her RetirementâShe had been thirty-eight years on the Stage. Her very extraordinary Powers, and her infinite Variety, gave her the justest Claim to be remembred as one of the most distinguished Actresses that perhaps any Country ever produced; and her uncommon Talents for the Theatre, were not more the admiration of the Public, than the Amiableness of her private-Life was that of her Acquaintance. TO THE THAMES. Written from the Temple, to Ardelia, in M.DCC.LXVIII. Gentle Thames, whose Waters lave Duly, these collegiate Walls, Stop, an instant, stop thy Wave; Tis a Lover's Voice that calls. E'er that Time can measure o'er One short Hour, thy silver Stream Shall salute the peaceful Shore, Where resides my Muse's Theme.â Gentle River! well I know What a Love thy Moon bears thee: How thy Springs obedient flow, Pouring Truth, and Harmony. Such a mutual Passion reigns In Ardelia's Breast and mine; She's the Orb that swells my Veins, To her Influence I resign!â Let thy undulating Tide With the sportive Sun-beam play: Close beneath her Window glide, Bid thy Cygnets mark thy Way. Should'st thou haply see my Fair, Lure her to thy view awhile; Tidings of my Welfare bear, Waft a Sigh, and steal a Smile.â Go,âand Plenty round thee pour, I'll thy Course no longer stay: Blessing many a distant Shore, Beauteous River! haste away. THE SWORD-KNOT: TO Mrs. WILBRAHAM BOOTLE. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXVIII. Be ever sworn, my Sword, to Honour's Cause, While round thy Hilt these golden Folds are ty'd, These Folds, the pleasing Token of Applause, That waking others Envy, wake my Pride. For they were work'd by Hands that serve a Mind Where lives each Grace that can embellish Life; Where ev'ry Virtue may its Image find, To form the Friend, the Parent, and the Wife! Nor small my Boast, that while the Fair-one wrought With artful Elegance, this Knot I wear, Her Goodness deign'd to waste on me a Thought, Destin'd for me her Toil, and deem'd me worth her Care. THE POWER OF FANCY. TO ARDELIA. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXVIII. Why neglected hangs thy Lyre, To thy Call my Muse attending? Once more strike the trembling Wire, Gentle Maid, thy Graces lending. See, where Echo on the Plain Waits to steal thy Notes of Pleasure; Strike, whilst I suggest the Strain, Charm the Ear with artful Measure. Sing of Fancy, young and gay, Sing her magic Operations; Those, by which she bears such sway O'er our Sense, and o'er our Passions. Paint her (for thou know'st her Pow'rs) Friend to Man, the World endearing; Solace of his drooping Hours, All his vary'd Labours cheering!â View'd with her each Object brightens Wheresoe'er our Footsteps rove; All Life's virtuous Deeds she heightens, Gilding Friendship, gilding Love. Taller springs the Sky-topp'd Mountain, More inviting waves the Wood, Cooler flows the Silver Fountain, Prouder swells the rapid Flood. Thee, my Love, she oft retraces, On my Heart long fix'd before; Gives Thee daily some new Graces, Rooting Passion more and more. By her Spells my Mind surrounded, Now she takes me in her Train; Led by Her I soar unbounded, Over Nature's wide Domain! She th'ideal Flight pursuing Scenes of Times unborn discloses; Many a future Prospect strewing With imaginary Roses!â Then at Fancy's radiant Shrine Oft I'll bow, my Pray'r addressing; Thou, Ardelia, too wilt join, Ask, and share with me her Blessing. Thro' her Regions let us roam, Down Illusion's Current gliding; Seek a visionary Home, Still in imag'd Joys confiding. Life's reliev'd from half its Cares, Fancy as our Guardian giv'n; For within her Arms she bears Hope, the Darling Child of Heav'n. FERNEY Ferney, a Chateau and Gardens, erected and laid out by Mr. De Voltaire, in the Neighbourhood of Geneva, which commands the Variety of Prospect mentioned in the beginning of this Poem.: AN EPISTLE TO MONS? DE VOLTAIRE. FIRST PRINTED IN THE YEAR M.DCC.LXVIII. While manly Praise th'Historic Wreath bestows, And Beauty's Sorrows grace thy fabled Woes, While ardent Youth, and well-instructed Age Alike confess the Wonders of thy Page, Shall these intruding Lines the Poet greet, And pierce the Shades that guard his calm Retreat? That calm Retreat, his happier Taste improv'd, Those Attic Bow'rs, by ev'ry Muse belov'd; Where native Roses blooming Genius sheds, Where Rural Elegance a Carpet spreads, Where Art, with sweet Simplicity combin'd, Shines the fair Emblem of the Planter's mind? While o'er the distant Scene stretch'd to the Skies Earth's Giant Offspring to the Sight arise; The tow'ring Alps uprear their stately Mound, And shapeless Piles th'extended Prospect bound, Here, join'd in Nature's beauteous Landscape, see The endless Charms of wild Variety. The Harvests wave, the purple Vineyards glow, Or trackless Mountains heave their load of Snow. Their tops unseen in thick'ning Air they shroud, And mix their Fleeces with each passing Cloud. Rocks far remov'd, in savage Greatness rise, Like rough-hewn Columns, to support the Skies; Cool slope the Vales, wide spread the mantling Woods, Bright shine the Streams that seek the distant Floods. Here a small Ocean's peaceful Waters sleep The Lake of Geneva., There raving Torrents emulate the Deep The Rhone and the Arve, which unite just below the Lake.. Unnumber'd Villas smile on ev'ry side, The seats of Prudence, unimpair'd by Pride; No Spot neglected, where the grateful Soil Can pay with rich Increase the Peasant's toil; Content and Peace fix here their prosp'rous reign, And silent Liberty defends the Plain. Midst Scenes like these, the Friend of human Kind Can range the Vast of Science, unconfin'd; For distant Flights can wing th'excursive Soul, Or glance with Light'ning's speed from Pole to Pole; Whether thro' Nature's devious Paths he strays, Pursues the Planet's course, the Comet's blaze; Or less advent'rous, quits th'AÃ«rial height To fix on mortal Woes a Mortal's sight; Strip the bar'd Heart of each dark Veil it wears, Expose its Hopes, its Conflicts, and its Cares; By bold Examples fire the youthful blood, Appal the wicked, or confirm the Good; Submit each dang'rous Wish to Reason's Laws, And arm our Passions in our Virtue's cause.â While Views like these, Voltaire, thy Bosom warm The Shades of Solitude have pow'r to charm. From Courts withdrawn, where'er thy footsteps bend, The Train thou lov'st, a faithful Train attend: Swift at the beck'ning of thy magic Hand They come, and Fancy leads th'ideal Band. Wit's lighter Offspring seeks the sunny Glade, While Satire skulks behind th'obscurer Shade; Near him, his Sister, Comic Maid, is seen, Who checks, with laughing Eyes, his rigid Mien; Combin'd, o'er Worlds an Empire they maintain, And ev'ry Vice and Folly wears their Chain. Th'Heroic Muse majestic sweeps along, And thoughtful meditates her lofty Song; Unroll'd she bears on high Fame's bright Record, And marks the Deeds of Gallic Henry's Sword The Henriade.. See too, Voltaire, what Wonders meet thine Eyes, Behold where Palaces, and Temples rise, Where wak'd by Thee, by Thee conven'd to Fame, The mighty Dead their ancient Semblance claim; Where laurel'd Chiefs, where awful Sages move, And transient Monarchs dignify the grove. Zayre.Lo! there, that Bane of Freedom, Love, and Truth, The dire Seraglio barr'd on Zara's youth! Too soon shall Fate a Brother lost restore, And claim the Parent who shall chide no more!â Yet will not Chance at last her Hopes befriend? And happier hours the Close of Life attend? For her the Mosque its thousand Lamps displays, For her the Crown prepares its regal blaze, For her with Gems resplendent, flames the Throne, And crowding Millions wait for her aloneâ They wait in vain!âno Queen shall greet their Eyes! Beneath Suspicion's frantic Steel she dies, While pausing o'er the Wound his Madness gave, The gen'rous Prince rejoins her in the Grave. Alzire.There good Alvarez Son by Death reprov'd, Restores Alzira to her First-Belov'd; By one great Act redeems his Errors past, And owns, his noblest Triumphs were his last. Semiramis.What proud Assembly throngs yon hallow'd Dome? Why nods the sculptur'd Roof? why shakes the Tomb? What daring Form the bounds of Death has crost? What great Event demands that sceptred Ghost? It speaksâoh! veil thy Terrors, awful Shade, And join in long Repose the glorious Dead! Obey'd already see thy dire Command! Behold thy Son in speechless Horror stand! On that drear Vault his blasted sight he bends, Whence pale in Death Semiramis ascends.â Attend, ye pitying Magi, hide the Scene, Hide the last Conflicts of a murder'd Queen! Oh, bid the guiltless Youth's Distraction cease, And close his wretched Mother's eyes in Peace! L'Orphelin de la Chine.Behold the North its barb'rous Legions pour, Fate heads their March, and China is no more. What Passions Zamti's rev'rend Bosom shake, Who combats Nature while his Heart-strings break! Tho' down his Cheek parental Sorrows roll, Confucius' Morals fix his patriot Soul; In vain his Wife, his lov'd Idame, brings A Claim that mocks the feebler Claim of Kings, In Honor firm, he seeks his Country's Good, And yields the Son's, to save the Prince's blood. Mariamne.Ill-fated Herod! spar'd by haughty Rome To meet thy sum of Wretchedness at Home! Happy! had CÃ¦sar's Arm withheld thy Right, Or hurl'd thee headlong from Ambition's Height! No more in Smiles thy faded Cheek is drest, Despair, and jealous Rage usurp thy Breast. Go, Tyrant, seek thy martyr'd Queen in vain, While Madness tells thee that she lives again! Still, still thy Thoughts her injur'd Worth pursue, Her matchless Beauty rises still to view; Such Worth, such Beauty, thou shalt long deplore, For know, fond Prince, the Dead return no more! Le Fanatisme, ou Mahomet.Hark! whence the Groans that pierce yon Cloister's Round! Death, agonizing Death, is in the Sound! 'Tis Mecca's ChiefâI know the hoary Sageâ That faithful Barrier 'gainst Mohammed's rage, Who long Religion's, Virtue's Champion stood, Now falt'ring marks each painful Step with blood.â Too strong the fleeting Soul's convulsive Strife! Too swift the Streams that drain the Fount of Life! He sinksâand, harder Fate!âsurvives to know His own misguided Offspring dealt the Blow. Merope.Lo! where Messene's captive Queen appears Serene in Grief, magnificent in Tears! Haste, Poliphontes! haste, the Shrine's prepar'd, Go, meet the fatal, but the just Reward Thy ripen'd Crimes demand!âNot Hymen now But Death intwines the Chaplet for thy Brow! Thy Prince has burst his Prison's dark abodes, He shines confest the Son of Grecian Gods: To peaceful Rites the shouts of War succeed, Egysthus conquers, and the Guilty bleed: Foremost th'Oppressor meets th'avenging Blow, And Furies howl his nuptial Song below! Les Scythes.But soft awhileâThe tranquil Scene disowns The Pride of Empire now, the Pomp of Thrones; Behold uprear'd before yon rustic Bow'rs A shrine of Moss, with intermingled Flow'rs, And thither led to seal their plighted Truth, An exil'd Virgin and a Scythian Youth! Yet ere the Bride concludes th'ill-omen'd Rite Her once-lov'd Persian flashes on her sight.â Return, unconscious Prince! where Glory calls, Go seek Ecbatana's deserted Walls! To Courts where Pleasures lead their Train, return, Ere Scythia's Echoes learn from thee to mourn! Pass one short Hourâthe cruel task is thine To part those Hands which willing Parents join! To fix a blameless Pair's eternal Doom, And change their festive Altar to their Tomb! Tho' Forms like these, Voltaire, around thee rove, And haunt the Limits of thy magic Grove, Such Sights alone poetic Eyes can share; Viewless, they mock the vulgar Gaze with air!â With careless thoughts let others range the Glade, Ascend the Slope, or pierce the verdant Shade, Thro' parted Woods the wand'ring Streams pursue, And Mountains fading to aÃ«rial Blue; To charm their Sense let Scenes like these combine; To wake the Dead, and talk with Kings, is Thine, Some fav'ring Planet grac'd his natal Morn, Whose Mind the Muses with each Grace adorn! In all his Paths they strew fresh op'ning Flowers, Fresh bloom for him Imagination's Bow'rs: To Pleasures there, from anxious Life he runs, Forgets its Sorrows, and its Tumult shuns. By some lov'd Object while his Soul is caught, Indulging all the Luxury of Thought, He peoples Deserts, ranges Worlds unknown, And bids arise Creations of his own; Enamour'd still of Nature's glowing Theme, Entranc'd by Fancy's ever flatt'ring Dream, Thro' all her visionary Realms he flies, And wakes to meetâLife's dull Realities. Yet why to Learning's Walks thy Steps confine? The Paths of social Gaiety are thine; Thine sprightly Wit, thine Elegance and Ease, With ev'ry Art, with ev'ry Wish to please.â But plac'd by Fate on Britain's distant Shore I talk of Pleasures I can share no more! Yet shall their fond Impression ne'er depart; Their fix'd Record within a grateful Heart In Mem'ry's Characters shall stand confest, Which Time retracing deepens in my Breast. Say why, reproachful to a polish'd Age, Ungen'rous Contests should the Learn'd engage? The Bards of ancient days bade Discord cease, The Muse's Sons were still the Sons of Peace; With Olive crown'd, to Virtue's cause confin'd, In social Bands the blameless Minstrels join'd.â Now, chang'd the SceneâWith Poets, Poets jar, And waste Parnassus is the Field of War. Yes! jealous Wits may still for Empire strive, Still keep the Flames of critic Rage alive: Our Shakespeare yet shall all his Rights maintain, And crown the Triumphs of Eliza's Reign. Above Controul, above each classic Rule, His Tutress Nature, and the World his School. On daring Pinions borne, to him was giv'n Th'aerial Range of Fancy's brightest Heav'n, To bid rapt Thought o'er noblest Heights aspire, And wake each Passion with a Muse of Fire.â Revere his GeniusâTo the Dead be just, And spare the Laurels that o'ershade the Dust.â Low sleeps the Bard, in cold Obstruction laid, Nor asks the Chaplet from a Rival's Head. O'er the drear Vault, Ambition's utmost Bound, Unheard shall Fame her airy Trumpet sound! Unheard alike, nor Grief, nor Transport raise, Thy Blast of Censure, or thy Note of Praise! As Raphael's own Creation grac'd his Hearse, The Transfiguration, that well-known Picture of Raphael, was carried before his Body to the Grave; doing more real Honour to his Memory, than either his Epitaph in the Pantheon, the famous Distich of Cardinal Bembo, or all the other adulatory Verses written on the same occasion. And sham'd the Pomp of ostentatious Verse, Shall Shakespeare's Honours by himself be paid, And Nature perish ere his Pictures fade.â Thou too, sweet Ferney, shall preserve a Name, And boast like Tempe's Vale eternal Fame: In Ages hence thy Groves will still be known, The Nine have blest, and mark'd them for their own, At their intreaty, Time (whose vengeful Hand No frail Memorials rais'd by Men withstand, Whose ruthless Eye beholds with like Disdain The low-brow'd Cottage, and the tow'ring Fane) His friendly Wings around these Bow'rs shall cast, Protect their Shades, and bid their Beauties last. To these its Praise Egeria's Grot shall yield, Alcinous' Gardens, and th'EnnÃ¦an Field, No more Adonis' fabled Rites be paid, But Poets pass the quite forgotten Shade. As he, whose steps to those fair Climes are led, Where smiling Naples rears her stately Head, Ascends the Cliff where Nature's grateful Hands Have plac'd the Laurel Virgil's Fame demands; Eager to view the mould'ring Walls that guard The sacred Ashes of th'immortal Bard: In Years remote, thus wand'ring from his Home To seek thee, Ferney, shall the Stranger come! But while thy Scenes his roving Eyes employ Sad Thoughts shall rise, and cloud his dawning Joy; Sighing, perhaps, he'll sayââThe great Voltaire âOnce plann'd these Walks, and made their Shades his Care!â âYet, far sublimer Tasks his Genius knew! â'Twas His to grace the Cheek with Pity's Dew! âTo slumb'ring Conscience sound the dread Alarm! âOr pour in Virtue's Praise th'harmonious Charm!â â'Twas thus his ripen'd Taste,âhis feeling Heart, âEmbellish'd Nature,âand ennobled Art!â TO ARDELIA. WRITTEN AT MARGATE IN M.DCC.LXVIII. As I pensively walk'd o'er the Steep At whose Foot the broad Wave dashes hoarse, And beheld the white Sails of the Deep 'Midst the Billows pursuing their Course; Ah! Wand'rers, I said with a sigh, Far happier's the Vessel in Port, Which dreads not like you the dark Sky, Nor lives of each Tempest the Sport! To new Worlds, and new Climates go steer, Still rove like the Heart unconfin'd; You have Rocks, and have Quicksands to fear, And your Hopes are all built on the Wind!â By my Stars at last guided to Peace, I trust to the Ocean no more; 'Tis Time that Life's Tumult should cease: My Bark is moor'd close to the Shore. With thy Sunshine, Ardelia, while blest No Storms can my Steadiness move; Your Bosom's my Harbour of Rest, And the Anchor that holds me, your Love. PROLOGUE TO THE Play of KING JOHN, Acted at Mr. Newcomb's at Hackney, 1769. The Bard whose Scenes this Night your Thoughts engage, Has somewhere told us, All the World's a Stage, Where all in one great Farce their Talents try, Are born,âlove,âwed,âgrow covetousâand die. From hence I think we fairly may infer That Nature is, or should be, Manager; And yet, in Nature's spite we ev'ry Day Cast our own Parts ourselves, and spoil her Play; Some vain Conceit disturbs her steady Plan, And Art debauches that strange Creature Man: Hence, e'er Life's Curtain drops, this Truth is plain, That few the Characters they take,âsustain. See, Cato-like, in Freedom's boasted Cause, The mad'ning Patriot raves of dying Laws, With ready Lash pursues the venal Tribe;â But what's the Sequel?âExitâwith a Bribe. Not less a Play'r the Methodist appears, In some hir'd Barn his casual Stage he rears; Prophane, loquacious, insolent, and loud, The grave Jack-pudding of a sniv'ling Crowd; Them of their Sins and Dangers he acquaints: Pockets their Cashâthen leaves them to the Saints.â The Prude austere, who shuns each forward Spark, Meets less reserv'd, her Footman in the Dark; Misers would lib'ral seem, Coquettes sincere, False Wits sententious, Hypocrites severe. What on Life's Stage can Parts like these command?â The Mark of Scorn let Affectation stand! If then the finish'd Man can sometimes err, And make Mistakes on the World's Theatre, Desert himself as various Passions call, And prove at last no Character at all, We ask your Candour if in us appears Th'imperfect Growth of unexperienc'd years; Tho' Buds, yet Learning like the Sun, has Pow'r To rear the Stem, and paint the future Flow'r!â If John should not each Stroke of Guilt impart, Nor Constance triumph o'er the feeling Heart, Think in Life's happy Morn we cannot know The sad Extent of Baseness, or of Woe! Boys as we are, to us each Scene is new, Tho' sometimes wrong, e'en there we copy you: To bold Attempts be then indulgence shewn, And learn to pity Faults so like your own. EPILOGUE TO THE Play of KING JOHN, Acted at Mr. Newcomb's at Hackney, 1769. Spoken by Lady Constance. Spite of Court Tricks, of Sorrows, Madness, Pain, I've brush'd thro' all, and am myself again.â O Ladies! what can not our Sex perform?â A bustling Woman lives thro' ev'ry Storm. Have I not dash'd my Character with Spirit? To bully two such Kings was no small Merit. Around the World to find the Wretch I'd search, Who dares to leave a Woman in the Lurch.â My Son the Dupe of regal Baseness made, Myself amus'd by Hopes, cajoll'd, betray'd, My Jointure lostâa Widowâand not young! I had no Weapon left me but my Tongue.â Should any Fair be here whose Nerves are weak, Who, when Man blusters, is afraid to speak, Whose gentle Bosom no Resentment fires, But with her Eau de Luce in Hand expires; She'll think, no doubt, my Voice too loudly thunders; Trust me, this female Instrument does Wonders. Those who turn o'er the page of ancient Story, Must own the Tongue was ever Woman's glory.â Who has not heard of fam'd Xantippe's Lute, That play'd her philosophic Husband mute? Or her's whose artful Notes so well could slander Her Rival, and subdue great Alexander?â What gifts of Speech had Egypt's Queen to boast? Who talk'dâtill Antony the World well lost!â Think of the Maid of Orleans, Joan of Arc, There was an enterprizing, female Spark! Whole Armies she harangu'd, whole Hosts withstood: Her Tongue was surely more than Flesh and Blood!â Tho' last, not least, shall Bess of England stand, Who box'd her Courtiers with her own fair Hand, To female Rules profess'd a brave dislike, Her Majesty could swear, as well as strike. Ladies, might I advise, let's urge our Pow'r, Dethrone usurping Man, or take him low'r. He'd only have us learn the gentler Arts Of studying Graces, and subduing Hearts; These are but Schemes to trifle Life away, Our nobler Aim isâUniversal Sway. TO ARDELIA. New Year's Day, 1770. Welcome to the new-born Year, Lo! it comes by Hope attended; Future Seasons too appear, All with future Pleasures blended. Mark, Ardelia, mark their Brow, With how sweet a Smile they greet us!â O may ever Time as now, With so kind an Aspect meet us! Doom'd with Thee my Course to bend Ev'ry Path of Life's inviting; Thou, my Wife, Companion, Friend, All is Sunshine, all delighting. Unregarded Seasons roll'd, E'er my Choice had Thee selected; Now they Happiness unfold, Not a moment flies neglected. 'Tis not Fortune, 'tis not State, 'Tis not what the World so prizes; In the Mind can Bliss create;â Far above such Toys it rises! 'Tis the Joy exalted Hearts Feel, while each to each a Blessing; And by all endearing Arts, Ever still their Love expressing. Such the Pleasures we partake; And if lengthen'd Years be giv'n, Virtue join'd with Peace, shall make Home a temporary Heav'n! EPILOGUE TO THE Play of MACBETH. Acted at Mr. Newcomb's at Hackney, 1770. Spoken by Lady Macbeth. As I was rising from the Arms of Death Before my Epilogue to get some Breath, I could not but reflect, what Shame, what Woe Ambition's Votaries are doom'd to know! And thought the World, that is, the Town, in me A Picture of its own sweet self might see; We beg t'except the present Company. You all have heard my poor dead Husband say The Weird Sisters marshall'd him his Way; And that he follow'd them he sore repented; Men are bewitch'd who will not be contented! Yet by the Sorceries of Fame,âPow'r,âRiches, We are all Hag-ridâThey are to us The Witches. Our Brain's the Cauldron, where they pour in Notions That make us quite boil over with Commotions. Now Titles, Jewels in the Charm they dab, And a rich Nabob makes it thick and slab: Next, Jointures, Pin-money, and Rule delight us, And nothing that's of Woman born can fright us; We mount their Broom-sticks, post o'er Sea and Land, Foul must be fairâthe World at our Command; Nay, what's impossible we would attain, And Birnam Wood must come to Dunsinane.â But should these Witches who my Spouse misled Deceive us too, and knock our Hopes on the Head, 'Tis dismal Work!âOf Phantoms we're made Fools, Ghosts spoil our Meals, and push us from our Stools; At ev'ry knocking we affrighted stare, And our dup'd Sense sees Daggers in the Air; To wound us more, Reflection only tells We've fallen Victims to our own poor Spells!â What think you, Ladies?âIs the Picture striking? Say, have I pencil'd it to all your Liking? No Answer!âThen I must conclude 'twill do; It suits our Sex, tho', Ladies, none of you. May you whom no such dangerous Phrenzy fires, Keep within lawful Bounds all vain Desires. 'Tis in the Calm of Life true Joys abound; There Truth, there heart-felt Peace, there Virtue's found!â Trust not the Tempest, it may fatal prove, And root up Conscience, Happiness, and Love!â Be sure resist when wild Ambition twitches, And warn'd by my Example, dreadâThe Witches. AN ADDRESS FROM THE THAMES. Presented to Mess??. Adam, On the Day when they first came to their new House in the Adelphi, 1771. 'Twas as The Brothers at that Pile arriv'd Where ancient Elegance and Taste reviv'd, Midst the broad Tide beneath that circling flows, Stretch'd on a sedgy Couch, Old Thames arose; 'Round him his Swans their snowy Plumage rear'd, A golden Trident at his Side appear'd; Upon his Moss-grown Urn his Arm was spread, And drooping Oziers crown'd his hoary Headâ Wide o'er Augusta's Tow'rs his Eyes he threw; His Time-worn Features brighten'd at the View. 'Twas then Th'Adelphi caught his ravish'd Sight, He gaz'dâhe smil'dâStill fixing with Delight Thrice he the Brothers hail'd, and thus began, While down his Beard the trickling Water ran. âYou whom Arts and Genius crown, âWelcome, welcome to your own; âYou, who out of Ruin raise âAll the Taste of ancient Days! âFrom my oozy Bed I came âTo be Witness of your Fame! âRude, but grateful is my Strain, âMen like you adorn my Reign. âLong and happy here reside âGreat Supporters of my Pride. âTime has been when o'er my Strand âProudest Nobles of the Land âDwellings rais'd with Cost profuse, âNot for Elegance, but Use; âCumbrous Loads that mov'd my Rage! âLabours of a darken'd Age!â âYou, their partial Plan resine, âElegance and Use combine.â âHappy on my Banks reside âGreat Supporters of my Pride. âJealous, have I heard too long âTiber flow in ev'ry Song, âArno's Torrent, Brenta's Stream âLive each lavish Muse's Theme: âThey shall triumph now no more, âEqual Glories grace my Shore. âRear'd by you, shall many a Pile âO'er my Silver Waters smile; âHappy on my Banks reside âGreat Supporters of my Pride. âAs in Homage, ev'ry Morn âI'll your Noble Work adorn, âOn my chrystal Bosom show âHills that nod, and Skies that glow; âPouring forth at each Return âHealth, and Plenty from my Urn.â âLong and happy here reside âGreat Supporters of my Pride! âYou whom Arts and Genius crown, âOnce more, welcome to your own.â He ceas'd, yet turn'd to take a parting Look, Then with an out-stretch'd Hand his Trident took, And wav'd it round;âObedient to his Will. His Swans drew close, the ambient Tide lay still; And whilst aloft th'attentive Brothers stood, Down sunk the ancient Monarch of the Flood. THE CONTENTED MAID. A SONG. I Let me live remov'd from Noise, Remov'd from Scenes of Pride and Strife, And only taste those tranquil Joys Which Heav'n bestows on rural Life! Innocence shall guide my Youth, Whilst Nature's Paths I still pursue, Each Step I take be mark'd with Truth, And Virtue ever be my View.â II Adieu, ye Gay, adieu, ye Great, I see you all without a Sigh; Contented with my happier Fate In Silence let me live and die! Sweet Peace I'll court to follow me, And woo the Graces to my Cell, For all the Graces love to be Where Innocence and Virtue dwell. TO ARDELIA, On her Recovery from a long Illness. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXI. 'Tis not Illusion!âThe dread Storm subsides!â The cheering Sunbeam darts athwart the Gloom; Returning Hope each imag'd Woe derides, And pointing forward marks a happier Doom! 'Tis not Illusion!âFrom the Tempest spar'd, Restor'd Ardelia rises to my Sight; My Breast to throb with Suff'rings long prepar'd, Once more feels Peace, nor throbs but with Delight. It was not thus, when late in Devon's Vales I view'd rich Nature with neglectful Eye; Damp'd with a gushing Tear the Summer Gales, And burthen'd ev'ry Echo with a Sigh! O! Mem'ry turn not back!âThe Terror's past;â 'Twas the hard Struggle of deep-lab'ring Care; 'Twas Death's dark Shade o'er Life's gay prospect cast, 'Twas Horror, almost bordering on Despair!â Could it be less?âWhen all I held most dear, She, whose sweet Converse bless'd each social Hour, Shook by Disease, alarm'd my ev'ry Fear, Drooping untimely, like a blighted Flow'r! Yet look not back!âSee thy Ardelia now In her own pleasing Form once more appears; Distress no longer sits upon her Brow, But Health's enliv'ning Grace each Feature wears. O welcome! thou dear Guardian of my Peace, Thou best of Women, and thou steadiest Friend! Smile thou but happy, ev'ry Care shall cease, For Joy and Comfort on thy Smiles attend. Th'eternal Spring which Tempe boasts so much, Nor all the Pleasures of the Paphian Grove, Can the charm'd Soul so exquisitely touch As the sweet Sense of Love requiting Love! And yet what Anguish oft such Love awakes? How like the Compass is the Heart that's true! Mine with each Motion, as the Needle, shakes, But ever faithful, trembling turns to You. Still shine its Polar Star, still live its Guide; Thy Influence gives it Virtue, gives it Fame: By Choice, by Sentiment, by Heaven ally'd, Our Course, our Fortunes, and our Views the same! That Pow'r Divine which trac'd the Lot of each Shall still, Ardelia, still protect our Days; Its Mercies shewn to Thee will ever teach Unbounded Trust, inspire unbounded Praise. Let us the Storms of Life with Firmness bear, For Storms will rise, and Man was born to feel; Fix'd be each Hope on His parental Care, Who never wounds but with Design to heal. TO Mrs. BLAKE, The Eldest of Six Sisters living together in Great Russell-Street, well known, and universally esteemed, for that Family Affection and general Benevolence, by which their Lives have been governed and characterized. With a Pair of Hand-Screens. These Hand-Screens, Dear Cousin, I send, and desire They may hang by your Chair, and insure you from Fire, They will shield you from Flames that might otherwise hurt, And drive back each Spark that's too forward and pert: Most attentively zealous in all you command, They'll your Wishes obey, if you move but your Hand.â I have giv'n them in Charge, that they still persevere To guard those good Features I so much revere, Where Beauty once reign'd, and strong character'd tells The still fairer Mind that behind them still dwells; Where the Look of Good Sense, and the Smile of Content Mark the Triumph of Life that in Virtue is spent!â And what Triumph is yours!âwho round you behold Five Sisters, whose Value no Muse can unfold! Who bound by those Wreaths which Affection hath wove, All their Days and their Years spend in Friendship and Love.â 'Tis a Picture so charming, so sweet to the Sight, That the oftner I see it, it gives fresh Delight; Its Lines are so just, and its Colours so true, It was painted by Virtue one sees at first View; 'Tis a Hand I most rev'renceâSo, let us agree That my Screens ne'er shall cover this Picture from me. CUPID's REMONSTRANCE, AN EPILOGUE, Spoken at Drury-Lane Theatre, 1772, By Miss Hopkins, in the Character of Cupid. My Arrows blunted, and unstrung my Bow, What can poor Cupid do? or whither go?â So mighty once, where'er I aim'd my Dart It pierc'd the Bosom, and inflam'd the Heart; But Times are chang'd!âNow, all's so hard within My utmost Efforts cannot raze the Skin.â Good Folks, behold my Rival Pulling out a Marriage Settlement.âThese Indentures Now settle,âsign,âand seal all Love Adventures. By Passion quite unmov'd your modern Lover Wraps his Affections in this Sheep-skin Cover; Int'rest, not Choice decides, Wedlock is bought, As for the Party, 'tis not worth a Thought: Girls argue thus, âIf I dislike my Man, âA Sep'rate Maintenance shall be my Plan; âOr should Another charm, I'm free to choose, âFor Doctors Commons will undo the Noose.ââ Hearts now are ty'd with Knots that slip with Ease, To slacken, or disjoin whene'er they please: Hence new Subscription Balls, hence new Pantheons Strip new Dianas, and make new Acteons; Hence Bills are daily read in both the Houses, To sep'rate faithless Wives, from faithless Spouses; Nay, my old Gall'ry Friends untye their Fetters, And cross the Breed, to imitate their Betters. Thus turn'd adrift, deserted and forlorn, The few who dare protect me, meet with Scorn; Nay moreâto prove this Town not made for me, They have Black-ball'd me at the Coterie.â My Pow'r extinct, think you I'll e'er endure To live among you on a Sinecure? Not I in faith;âI'll hence to Justice Brass, And to my Paphian Parish,âbeg a Pass. A BURLESQUE ODE, On the Author's clearing a new House of Workmen. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXII. Midst the fair Range of Buildings which new-rear'd, The Bloomsbury, and St. Giles Gang divide, A Crew of Workmen who no Mortal fear'd, Sat idling by th'unfinish'd Chimney's side. A dusky Smoak the smould'ring Shavings pour, Bruis'd empty Porter-Pots bestrew the Floor, And while their Tools lie useless on the Ground, In wonted Chorus thus the Song goes round. âLet Confusion mark our Toil, What we cannot mend we'll spoil; Let our worthy Masters gain, Do,âand then undo, again. Fling about the Iron Crow, Give this finish'd Part a Blow, Glue a little, saw a bit, Plane this Pannel, t'other split, Making, marring is our Duty, Ne'er for Line or Plummet care, Damn the Compass, damn the Square, Crooked is the Line of Beauty.â A pickled Dog then rose, and told What House best Purl, and Spirits sold, Of many an Alehouse-gambol play'd, Of Matches fought, and Wagers laid, Nay, more, and which worst is, How oft he scap'd Justice, How he'd blast a Man's eyes with a jirk, How down two Pair of Stairs, He once kick'd Two Surveyors, Who dar'd to examine his Work. How he damn'd Sir John Fielding, and gave him the Lie, How for Wilkes he got drunk Till his Cash was all sunk, And went to Gaol forâLiberty. Each roar'd Applause, and all the Caitiff Throng, Renewing first their Quids, renew'd their Song. âLet Confusion mark our Toil, What we cannot mend we'll spoil; Let our worthy Masters gain, Do,âand then, undo again. Fling about the iron Crow, Give this finish'd Part a Blow, Glue a little, saw a bit, Plane this Pannel, t'other split, Making, marring is our Duty; Ne'er for Line, or Plummet care, Damn the Compass, damn the Square, Crooked is the Line of Beauty.â What Toils await the trifling Race of Man! Who multiply their Cares the most they can; Still sighing after something more, They want a Shelf, they want a Door, Heav'ns! what a Fuss about it! 'Tis doneâIn Joiners who'd confide? The Shelf's awry, the Door's too wide; They'd better been without it!â While unheeded fly the Moments, Giv'n to Pleasure, lost in Prate, Others feel them linger tedious, Weigh'd with Anguish, black with Fate. My giddy Pen forgot to say, It chanc'd 'twas Execution Day, The hanging hour was past; A half-scar'd Mason rushing in, Exclaim'd âTo idle thus is sin, I saw him breathe his last.â Poor Jack upon the three-legg'd Tree! A Pretty Carpenter was He! Good lack!â Poor Jack!â Gone in a Crack!â There's more of Us will follow Thee.â Tho' 'tis my Belief That the Dog was a Thief And both given to drinking and raking, Yet he knew well his Trade, All Advantages made, But mistook for House building, House breaking. Fix'd Terror glar'd in ev'ry Workman's Face, Each knowing Jack's was nearly his own Case, All rose, and search'd their Tools in sullen Mood, While the grim Mason thus his Tale pursu'd: âThro' St. Giles moving slowly (All the gaping Crowd intent) Jack with Looks that pictur'd Sorrow, Suck'd an Orange as he went. High, and low, Above, below, From Garret Tops Down to the Shops 'Twas all one staring Face to view the mournful Show, Ye Chips of the Block What had been your Shock Had you seen when to Tyburn he came? How he chang'd Colour often As he look'd at his Coffin, And his Coat that reproach'd him with Shame, For his Coat, and his Coffin were both ready made, Being stolen, or borrow'd in Jack's way of Trade. As he stood in the Cart It quite pierc'd my Heart To see him so tremble and snivel; Soon the Slip-Knot was ty'd, So he pray'd, sang, and cry'd; And I hope he's not gone to the Devil.ââ As when a Macaroni of high note Trips thro' the Streets in a short-skirted Coat, With Self-applause humming an Op'ra Air, If chance some Chimney-Sweeper unaware Should turn short on him, and his Dollship brush, Or some rude Porter's Load his Nosegay crush, Ah what can hide, what heal the Shame! His Coat, his Nosegay gave him Fame! No more his Looks their wonted Ease confess, But on his alter'd Brow is pictur'd pale Distress: So chang'd the Features of this miscreant Crew, Who by the Story warn'd their several Tasks renew. Labour now resumes his Reign, All are busy once again; Hurry, Hurry, Bustle, Bustle, Workmen against Workmen justle.â Hear you not the Iron Crow? See you not the Glue-Pot flare? Sharper far the Echoes grow, Dust and Shavings choak the Air! With Sounds that split the Ear they nail and wedge, And jagged Saws set all one's Teeth on Edge!â Come and aid me, meek ey'd Patience, Teach me to support Delay; Thou, O Time, at length relieve me, Drive these Wretches far away.â And lo! good Heaven! their loitring Course is run, All's puzzled out at last, their destin'd Labor's done. Off, behold the vile troop pack, Each his Budget at his Back, Error stamping all their Notions, Error guiding all their Motions;â Nay,âmove quick, ye idle Train, Ne'er, oh ne'er return again!â They close the Doorâbut parting go To cause some other Person Woe. Ah luckless Mortal! for thy Heart I grieve, Which with unnumber'd Cares this Caitiff Crew shall rive. And now the Sound of Discord's o'er, Who can my ill-form'd House restore? Heal its Defects? its Faults amend? Who, Adam? who but thee, my Friend? Ah hither haste With all your Taste, And round my Walls your Graces fling, Wave but your Hand, At your Command Shall Beauty from Disorder spring. None but a Hercules was able To clear the foul Augean Stable, And not a Soul but him, one reads, Who with a genuine, Classic Club Could every other Creature drub, And boldly dar'd to lop the Hydra's fifty Heads. What is this Hydra but False-Taste? Deform'd, unfashion'd, and ungrac'd, Whose fifty Mouths for many an Age O'er Britain's Fabrics spit their Rage: But Thou hast lain its Fury low, It sinks when Genius gives the Blow! Strike deepâTh'Herculean Conquest now maintain, Nor let this hateful Monster breathe again. PROLOGUE, TO THE Play of JULIUS CÃSAR, Acted at Mr. Newcomb's at Hackney, 1774. Or Boy, or Man, who has not seen in Town A Comic PrintâThe World turn'd upside down? Where ev'ry System, ev'ry Law's revers'd; By new-born Infants are the Aged nurs'd, Who dandling both their Parents on their Knee, Teach them, with Rod in hand, their A, B, C There Pigs ill-usage will no longer brook, But murder, rosin, spit, and roast the Cook. Grooms by their Horses saddled, scour the Plain; By the meek House lamb is the Butcher slain. Women the Breeches wear, and shine in Arms, While at their Toilets Men improve their Charms. Each Species change,âBeasts in the Sea delight, Fish fly about in Air,âDay turns to Night, And all's to what it should beâOpposite. This, which was Satire held in Days of Yore, Ill suits not Seventeen Hundred Seventy Four, As I conceive the World on a just Survey, Will seem to all full as much topsey turvey. As for ExampleâCourtier,âPatriot, trace, One is a Man in Power,âone out of Place; Observe awhile this Whirligig go round, The flaming Patriot's at the Levee found, The Courtier chang'd too makes as great a Stir, And without Mercyâroasts the Minister.â Should we the Scenes of private Life pursue, What Contradictions open to the View! Out of their Element one half appear, Colours which Nature ne'er design'd them, wear. Some grow mere Devils to avoid Restraint, The Devil in Compliment becomes a Saint.â See Youth trick'd out with Affectation's Plume, See Age its youthfull Follies reassume; See Dames of fifty-five new Ogles glance, And gouty threescore go to School to danceâ Oh!âhad the World but right End upward stood, Think ye, my candid Friends, we ever should, A Band of Striplings, personate to you Scenes which for Heroes only Shakespeare drew? Beneath this Roof to Truth, and Virtue led, Tutor'd in Science, and to Learning bred; That we should shut our Books, and boldly prate Of injur'd Freedom and a falling State? Of the World's Sovereign urge the bloody Doom? Or fix the Fortune of Imperial Rome? Bold is the TaskâIf haply we succeed, Crown with applauding Hands the perilous Deed Or should we fail, that Failure we implore You'll 'mongst the Follies rank ofâSeventy Four. TO Miss DUVAL, On her Marriage with Mons?. JOLY, of GENEVA. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXIV. Heedless of Seas, or adverse Winds that rise, By ev'ry tender Sentiment enchain'd, Lur'd by a Bridegroom's Name, the Lover flies To claim that Heart which Merit only gain'd. For, gentle Lucy, thy well-tutor'd Mind Ne'er sought with Wealth or Pomp thy Days to share; Wish'd but Life's peaceful, virtuous Walks to find, Nor deem'd its idle Pageants worth thy Care. Thine was each self-approving Joy that rose From filial Duty piously discharg'd; Which Friendship, or Humanity disclose; For all these Graces still thy Mind enlarg'd. Such, good-starr'd Youth, such is the Heart you've won; What greater Treasure than an Heart like this?â A Life so calm, so pure, so well begun, Gives thee firm Promise of domestic Bliss. Take then thy Lucy,âbe her Guardian,âFriend, Shield her within thine Arms from Fortune's Frown; Her Weakness 'gainst a faithless World defend, And prize that Merit which discern'd thine own.â Go, well-match'd Pair, blest in each other's Love, Go spread your fair Example far around; And as Years roll'd on Years shall onward move, In Hymen's Bands be none more happy found!â Yet, gentle Lucy, where is Joy unmix'd? Sighing the Muse thy parting Step pursues; Sighs her own Loss; that Chance thy Lot hath fix'd Where all its subject Lake Geneva views. Enchanting Spot! to me long-known, endear'd; Where prudent Laws Ambition's Pow'r restrain, By Wisdom rul'd, as first by Wisdom rear'd, Where Virtue sways, and simplest Manners reign! As thro' these Scenes by thy lov'd Husband's Side Thou stray'st, where Nature's Beauties scatter'd lie, Or mark'st th'eternal Alps in Circuit wide (Once my fond Theme!) all mingling with the Sky: Then, for thy steady Friendship well I know, Which Time nor Absence e'er can wear away; Then sometimes, Lucy, one kind Thought bestow On Him, who sorrowing sends this parting Lay.

KEATE. Persons of the Drama. DORASTUS, a rich Shepherd, living as a Hermit. LYSANDER, a young Spartan, Lover of Euphemia. MUSIDORUS, an Arcadian Shepherd. EUPHEMIA, betrothed to Lysander. DELIA, Friend to Euphemia. DAPHNE, Daughter of Musidorus. LAURA, Daughter of Musidorus. ARCADIANS. Scene, ARCADIA. ACT I. SCENEâA beautiful Prospect of Arcadia; Shepherds Dwellings dispersed at a Distance, and a Wood on one Side. Enter LYSANDER, EUPHEMIA, and DELIA. LYSANDER. Thanks to the Gods! our cheerful Steps at last Have reach'd these happy Climes; where refug'd Virtue, 'Midst laughing Vales, o'er-arch'd by cloudless Skies, Enjoys a calm Retreat. And now, lov'd Maid! Whom I have follow'd, and would follow still To Earth's remotest Bounds; 'tis Time to claim That bright Reward, which, before Delia here, Your lov'd Companion Delia, you have sworn, Soon as my Voice had welcom'd your Arrival, Should crown my willing Service. EUPHEMIA. Gen'rous Youth! Whose fond Compliance with a Maid's Request Has led you far from home; the Boon you ask Will poorly pay your Virtues; take my Hand, And know I give it but to pledge a Heart By ev'ry Title yours. DELIA. Unshaken, long Remain this Union!âNow! Euphemia, now Behold your Hopes accomplish'd!âBreathe we not A purer Air? And does not this bright Scene, Which opens round us, realize the Truth Of all Aranthe said? EUPHEMIA. It does, it does; Peace to her Shade! And, Delia, we shall bless The friendly Path we trod; though scarcely yet Lysander knows why I so long forbore To crown his Love, and in this distant Clime Would only wed. LYSANDER. It was enough for me To know your Wish; contented to be blest On your own Terms. But oft I've heard you say, Your dying Mother, poor Aranthe! left These Counsels in your ear, with that sad Sigh Which never more is heard. EUPHEMIA. Her Care alone Rear'd me to what I am; yet I ne'er knew A Parent's Fondness. She was of Arcadia; And when the Spartan Arms, with fierce descent, Sought these defenceless Shades, was forc'd away With other Captives. Then, all pale with Tears, Lest Violence should seize what Choice deny'd, She gave the Plund'rer, what he ask'd, her Hand, And yielded to his Wish.âVows thus constrain'd Ne'er draw down Blessings. Fifteen tedious Years She felt a lordly Husband's rigid Sway; Till Fate dissolv'd her Bondage, and restor'd Her Liberty. LYSANDER. Euphemia, you relate What moves my Wonder; for till now, I deem'd You were Aranthe's Child. EUPHEMIA. I thought so too: But mark the Sequel.âFreedom came too late: Worn by Dissimulation's irksome Task For Years repeated, slow-consuming Care Subdu'd at last her Frame. Arcadia's Vales She now no more could visit; that fond Hope Through long Captivity sustain'd the Soul, Which sunk to find it lost. LYSANDER. Not long the Mourner Surviv'd her Husband? EUPHEMIA. Scarcely half the Space Of ten sad Moons. The Lamp of Life each Day Burnt fainter; and a sudden Stroke its Light Almost extinguishing, she call'd me to her, And bade me bring the Friend whom most I lov'd, My Delia, with me. To our Ears she then, By interrupted Words with Pain brought forth, Unlock'd her Heart;âTold me, a Mother's Name Was but assum'd, that He whom she espous'd Might treat me gently;âThat my infant Years Were to her Care confided;âThat her All She had bequeath'd me;âAnd her dying Wish Was, that when Time should favor the Intent, I'd seek Arcadia.ââIf, my Child!â she cry'd, âThy Lot be Happiness, 'twill meet thee there; âBe Hope thy Guide: The righteous Gods, perhaps, âMay there restoreââBut whatâwas all conceal'd; For Death that instant seiz'd her Pow'rs of Speech, And left me lost in Darkness and Distress. DELIA. Nor till her Spirit fled, ceas'd she to fix, Though Utt'rance was deny'd, on my fair Friend Looks forcible as Language.âWe have search'd, Where'er Conjecture wings its dubious Flight, To trace her Meaning, or descry from whence Euphemia drew her Birth; but ev'ry Path Perplex'd and tangled, still in Darkness ends. LYSANDER. Some Cause forbade, or she had ne'er so long Conceal'd the Story, which her parting Breath Could not enough disclose. But say, my Love, Did not Aranthe oft' at other Times Discourse the Beauties of her native Land, The more to tempt you to this Pilgrimage? EUPHEMIA. Oh, frequent! frequent! It was oft' her Subject, And she would tell such Wonders of Arcadia, So boast its joyous Skies, where Love, where Truth, And fair Simplicity reign'd undisturb'd, That all entranc'd I heard her, and my Soul Dwelt on her Story, till it pin'd to see These Heav'n-distinguish'd Regions.âTo myself, In secret, then I vow'd, that I would ne'er But in Arcadia wed.âIt was for this Arcadia was so oft my Theme, when first You grac'd me with your Notice; 'twas for this I hither led you; and at some near Shrine My Vow shall be confirm'd. LYSANDER. Blest be the Night, When forth I led you from detested Sparta, Ne'er to behold it more! Detested Sparta! Where the firm Virtue of our rigid Fathers, Which nerv'd their Arm, and gave th'admiring World A Line of Heroes, is debas'd by Vice, Or crush'd by pow'rful Faction.âTo forget The Cloud that shades my Country, be my Task; Since thence I've borne a Prize, in whom I view The Graces of the purest Times. EUPHEMIA. No more! Already you o'erpay me. LYSANDER. Bounteous Maid! My Tongue would beggar Language, should it speak The Transport I now feel to call Thee mine, And to enfold Thee thus.âWhatever Joys This Clime shall offer, they can nothing add To mine, possessing Thee. DELIA. Behold! a Troop Of Swains advancing! Haply, we from them May gain all due Intelligence. LYSANDER. Yet hold! They seem assembled on some Ceremony; 'Twere best at Distance mark them;âFor a while Let us withdraw beneath these bow'ring Shades. [They retire into the Wood. EnterâMUSIDORUS, DAPHNE, LAURA, and a Number of Arcadian Shepherds and Shepherdesses, bearing in their Hands Garlands of Flowers. They advance, singing. CHORUS. Give the Hour to sober Pleasures; Cheerful Hearts are Life's best Treasures: Let the choral Song go round; Echo shall our Joys resound. MUSIDORUS. Onward, Arcadians! bear your flow'ry Wreaths, Twin'd with the fairest Sweets of ev'ry Kind That scent the Ev'ning Air, and with them deck The sacred Pines of Pan; while the deep Grove Tells to the distant Hills our festive Rites.â 'Tis wisely done to make the most of Life: Whilst Temp'rance sits the Guardian of our Sports, Each grateful Smile that dimples o'er the Cheek Is Tribute paid the Gods! FIRST ARCADIAN. Let such as tread The busy Haunts of Men, where Envy shoots Its poison'd Arrows, wear their Brow o'ercast; Our Vales are only Witnesses of Joy, And Mirth well-authoriz'd; Our fertile Soil A happier Sun-shine warms; and the press'd Grape, Pouring from Goblets deep its purple Stream, Drives off imagin'd Ills, and the cheer'd Mind Attunes to Harmony. AIR. Gloomy Care can ne'er controul Joys that wait the temp'rate Bowl; Welcome all its pure Delights, Blameless Days, and peaceful Nights. In our Cup her radiant Wings Fancy dips, and brighter springs; To her the Pow'r is giv'n To soar beyond the Pride of Kings, And form on ev'ry Spot a Heav'n. LYSANDER, EUPHEMIA, and DELIA, appear from the Wood. LYSANDER. Forgive us, Shepherds, If we as Strangers peradventure press Somewhat abruptly on you. Wide is spread The Fame of your fair Clime; and it hath hither Allur'd our Steps, inquisitive to learn That true Simplicity which marks your Lives, And makes them deem'd so happy. MUSIDORUS. You are welcome To these pacific Shades, and doubly so As being Strangers: But if chance you come From Scenes of artful Life, where Pomp displays Its splendid Fallacies, ours scarce will charm.â Yet here Content resides, and rural Ease; With ev'ry Blessing which the bounteous Pan Bestows on virtuous Toils. LYSANDER. Deem not that we So ill have read the World, that our fool'd Sense Is caught by Pageantry.âNought charms so much As the bright Lustre of an upright Mind, Active, and steady.âAnd in lonely Vales, And Roofs unnotic'd, oft' such Virtues dwell As Courts with Pride might boast; though all unseen Their Graces bloom, save by a circling few, And Heav'n's approving Eye. FIRST ARCADIAN. Your Reas'ning, Youth, Bespeaks a Mind well tutor'd; and your Chance Hath thrown you amongst Men, who know to prize The Heart that points to Virtue.âFreely share Whate'er these Plains afford. Say, will you join Our festive Rites? Or, rather, do you seek Rest and Refreshment?âLong perchance hath been Your Way; and these your fair Companions tire. LYSANDER. Trueâlong hath been our Way; but we have made it Pleasure, not Toil.âYou shall at Leisure know Whate'er in the small Circle of our Lives May win your Ear. Suffice it now to say What beyond Rest, beyond your proffer'd Care, Sits nearest at my Heart, is, that you guide Our Steps, to where before some hallow'd Shrine, This beauteous Maid and I may swear till Death A lasting Union.âLong, too long, my Bliss Hath been delay'd; and tedious seems to creep Each lazy Minute now, till I can boast Alliance with her Virtues. MUSIDORUS. Such a Place Stands in the Covert of yon Wood; be mine The Task to lead you thither.âLeagues of Love, Approv'd by Virtue, from their starry Thrones The Gods behold well pleas'd!âGo you before, My Daughters, and with virgin Hands adorn The nuptial Altar.âShepherds, you'll pursue Your purpos'd Sports: we shall at Eve rejoin. [Exeunt Daphne and Laura. LYSANDER. Here, my Euphemia, our long Voyage ends, Safe in the wish'd-for Port we ride in Peace, Anchor'd by Love and Friendship.âGen'rous Swain! Your hospitable Kindness asks more Praise Than my poor Tongue can give; a Time may come When I may better speak it. MUSIDORUS. Nay! no more; I act but as I ought.âBenevolence Is due from Man, to Man!âCome, Lady, on; The Altar now attends your maiden Vows; Be thrifty of the Hour, the Day wears fast. [Exeunt Musidorus, Lysander, Euphemia, and Delia. FIRST ARCADIAN. Now with light Foot to sportive Measures beat, Strike ev'ry sprightly Note, that ere we join In yonder hallow'd Grove, we to the Dance May add new Graces, and avow our Zeal. A DANCE of Arcadians. After the Dance, the Chorus repeated. Give the Hour to sober Pleasures; Cheerful Hearts are Life's best Treasures: Let the choral Song go round; Echo shall our Joys resound. [Exeunt. SCENEâA wild rocky Entrance to a Cave; on one Side of which is seen a Wood. DORASTUS enters from the Cave. After looking attentively around, he comes slowly forward. Hail! to the Ev'ning Sun, which from the West Empurples all the Sky, and this my Cave Gilds with its parting Rays; this moss-grown Cave, Long by my Footsteps worn!âFor since the Arms Of the fell Spartans tore my Child away, (Sole Pledge of a dear Union) with the Friend To whom her dying Mother gave the Charge To train her Infancy; and ev'ry Hope To trace their Fate is vain; I've shun'd the Plain, Nor mingled with the Gay.âIn these lone Shades I wake my Mind to Truth; and as the Stream Of Life flows gently on, pursue that Peace Philosophy inspires, and patient wait Th'Appointment of the Gods!âBut I must henceâ The length'ning Shadows warn me now to seek In the near Valley such sweet-smelling Flow'rs As give their Perfumes to the Ev'ning Gale, And strew them round yon vacant Tomb I've rear'd To sooth a Father's Sorrows.âThere's in Grief A melancholy Pleasure, which indulg'd, Becalms the Soul;âand such this Task to me.â O much-lamented Maid! if from this World Escap'd, thou sit'st a Spirit in Air, accept A Parent's pious Off'ring;âOr if still Thou draw'st the Breath of Bondage, or art doom'd To tread the flinty Ways of Life, may Heav'n Give thee proportion'd Virtue!âYet a while, A transient Space, Time's friendly Hand shall guide Each Suff'rer to his Rest, and all our Cares Shall melt to nothing, like the Morning Dew. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT. ACT II. A RURAL SCENE. Enter LYSANDER, EUPHEMIA, DELIA, MUSIDORUS, DAPHNE, and LAURA. As they are all advancing from the End of the Stage, DAPHNE and LAURA sing the following DUET. Hymen pleas'd your Faith surveys; All his peaceful Blessings share! Purest Friendship crown your Days! Joy attend you, happy Pair! LYSANDER. Thanks, courteous Fair-ones, Thanks; I little hop'd Such Bride-maids for my Love; but you are all As bounteous as your Skies; and your kind Care Shall bind us both your Debtors.âYou, good Shepherd, Who with your Daughters at the Shrine of Pan Have witness'd to our Vows, shall see, I trust, That they were seal'd with Truth, and only join'd Hearts of congenial Mould. MUSIDORUS. May circling Years Still firmer bind them! and the Hand of Death Alone dissolve this Union! EUPHEMIA. Heav'n so grant!â Most freely, Shepherd, I accept your Grace, And proffer'd Services; wrapt in Delight To meet already in this stranger Land Such hospitable Smiles. DAPHNE. Nor here is seen A Smile the Heart avows not; our plain Life Disdains those Arts and Falshoods, which they say Are practis'd by the Great-ones of the World.â Ambition walks not here; nor is here known Envy, its fell Associate.âRural Cares Employ the fleeting Day, and one firm Chain Of social Harmony unites us all.â Our temp'rate Board gives Cheerfulness and Health; And there Contentment sits, and bids us scorn What cheated Man calls Luxury. LAURA. Nor yet Shall our calm Plains abuse your Hopes; the Eye As well as Mind is solac'd.âNature blooms In youthful Beauty round us, from her Urn Scatt'ring unnumber'd Treasures. Mark how glows The vivid Landscape; and the burthen'd Earth Pants with the gay Profusion. EUPHEMIA. A new World Springs up before me. See, Lysander, see What vary'd Sweets shall strew our future Paths Beneath this better Sun. LYSANDER. Rooted I stand, And lost in Admiration thank the Gods For all their Bounty to me; chief for Thee Their noblest Boon, thou Crown of my Desires! Thou lovely Charmer!âO my Friends, excuse A young Man's Transport; when you better know This Maiden's Excellence, you will confess My Tongue no Flatt'rerâfor she wears a Heart So pure, so spotless, that it might be shrin'd In Crystal, and have all its Movements scann'd! MUSIDORUS. My Bosom shares your TransportâGentle Lady, Beneath the Umbrage of yon tufted Trees, Which shade the Margin of the azure Stream That steals along its Side, our Dwelling stands, Rustic and simple; thick around it shoots The flaunting Woodbine; and each fragrant Flow'r Adorns the verdant Scene.âThere I've prepar'd A cheerful Welcome;âAll our rural Sports My Daughters shall relate, and teach you too, If so you like, to tend our fleecy Folds; For all are Shepherds here. EUPHEMIA. Something but now, As o'er the Lawn we pass'd, Laura discours'd Of a grey Hermit, whose religious Life Gain'd him such Love, that each Arcadian deem'd His Blessing prosp'rous; fain on this Day's Act Would I implore it. MUSIDORUS. Lady, he you mean Dwells at the mossy Foot of yonder Rock, The good Dorastus; Shepherd once himself, And Master still of many a Flock; but he, Long from our Plains sequester'd, mourns retir'd A Loss that weighs his grey Hairs down.âAll here View him with filial Love; for he's to all A Friend, a Father.âThither I'll conduct you As homeward now we pass. LYSANDER. We will attend; Yet tarry but a Space, while from those Trees Of clust'ring Roses, that invite the Touch, I pluck some crimson Buds, and twist a Wreath For my Euphemia's Brow; she has not yet Receiv'd her bridal Garland. [Exit. EUPHEMIA. On this Bank Await we his Return. Sit, my fair Maids; And, Delia, calm the Flutt'rings of my Heart By some soft Strain.âGive me that cheering Song Aranthe so much lov'd. DELIA. 'Tis well devis'd, Nor foreign to the Moment.âI obey. SONG. All the Splendor which Wealth can display Is so vain, that it quickly must cloy; Like a Bubble, it soon melts away, If Hope does not heighten the Joy. Sweet Passion! without thee, the Soul In the Midst of Fruition would tire; Into Times yet unborn thou canst roll, And expand on the Wings of Desire. It was Hope that first planted my Vine, And its Clusters luxuriously spread; Rear'd my Fig-tree, whose Branches intwine, And so gratefully shadow my Head. Hope comforts the Mourner's sad State, Sooths the Wretch who is struggling with Pain, Bids the Captive support his hard Fate, And to Home turns his Eyes back again. Bright Charmer! ah! live in my Breast, Round my Temples thy Garland still bind; Thou shalt calm all my Sorrows to rest, And cheer with thy Sunshine my Mind. EUPHEMIA. Kind Delia, take my Thanks.âI feel the Truth Thy Strain inspires; for see Lysander comes, Who round the little Region of my Heart Bids Hope triumphant live. LYSANDER re-enters, with a Chaplet of Roses in his Hand. LYSANDER. Euphemia, wear This blooming Wreath, in Honor of the Day, And as an Emblem of our twin'd Affections.â [Presents her the Chaplet. This hath a transient Date, but they, I trust, Shall never know Decay.âNow let us speed To seek the Hermit's Cave; good Shepherd, on. [Exeunt. The Scene opening discovers a Wood. In the Middle of the Stage is a Monument, with the Statue of a Nymph lying on it. Upon its Base appears this Inscription, in large Characters, I TOO WAS AN ARCADIAN. DORASTUS is seen standing near the Tomb, with a Basket of Flowers in his Hand, singing the following AIR. My Woes, O Mem'ry! cease to trace; Ah! curse no more the Spartan Race! Come, meek-ey'd Patience, calm my Mind, And make it to its Fate resign'd.â This fancy'd Form, this empty Tomb Relieves the Rigour of my Doom. Enter MUSIDORUS, LYSANDER, EUPHEMIA, DELIA, DAPHNE, and LAURA. MUSIDORUS. Behold the good old Man!âOn the still Air How sweetly floats his plaintive Voice!âBeside This Wood he dwells, and here at setting Sun Sings his accustom'd Dirge, as Mem'ry drops A Sigh o'er happier Scenes that Time hath clos'd. LYSANDER. Say, what yon Pile which he bestrews with Flow'rs? It seems a Tomb, and that fair sculptur'd Form Declares it such; as does the Epitaph, âI too was an Arcadian.â MUSIDORUS. He bewails A Daughter torn away, on whom he built The Comfort of his Age; it is for her This mournful Pile is rear'd, these Rites perform'd.â But soft!âA Moment ends them; let us not Invade his Privacy. [They keep retired on one Side of the Stage. DORASTUS continues the Air, strewing the Flowers round the Tomb. Gentle Spirit, Peace be thine! This sad Office still be mine; These fond Marks of Love receive, All a drooping Sire can give. During the Song, Lysander discourses with Musidorus; âEuphemia, with Daphne and Laura. She often fixes her Eyes on the Monument, with Marks of Emotion. The Song ended, they advance. MUSIDORUS. Good Ev'n, Dorastus, And heard be all thy Orisons!âBehold I bring with me a Pair, who even now At yonder consecrated Altar seal'd The Bond of wedded Faith.âFar is their Home, Beyond the Southern Mountains; but Desire To visit these our Plains hath urg'd their Steps Hither, to sojourn with us.âLo! they sue Your Grace and Welcome; and will prove, I judge, Worthy your Courtesy.âTheir bridal Bed My Daughters have prepar'd; and I myself Shall be their this Night's Host; a secret Impulse Hath won me to their Service. LYSANDER. Strangers here, Each Mark of Hospitality must charm; And sooth to say, this our kind Patron's Care Hath far outstrip'd my Hope.âMight we obtain Thy Pray'rs, respected Hermit, nothing then Remains to crown our Fortune. DORASTUS. If the Blessing Of an old Man by many a Sorrow worn, And bow'd by many a Year, can aught avail, O take it, freely take it.âMay the Act Of this fair Day be prosper'd! may a Length Of Happiness be yours! a virtuous Race To both endear the World! and all your Paths, Your Ev'ning Paths of Life, be spread with Flow'rs That never grew in mine! LYSANDER. Ah! much I grieve That your's have prov'd uneven!âFor your Wishes Count me your Debtor.âMy Euphemia too, My Bride shall thank you; for her Heart is gentle, And grateful as the Flow'r that pays with Sweets The genial Summer's Bounty!â As he turns to Euphemia, he finds her looking towards the Tomb with a melancholy Attention. Ha! my Love, Whence this Amaze? why dost thou bend thy Sight On yonder Tomb? and wherefore on thy Brow Sits a descriptive Sorrow, that hath drank The Lustre of thine Eyes, and damp'd the Joy Which sparkled there but now?âSay, why is this? What the strange Cause? EUPHEMIA. The Cause is in myself; O my Lysander! I have fool'd my Sense With visionary Hope, and now awake To meet my Error. LYSANDER. Nay! explain, Euphemia. EUPHEMIA. This good Man's Sigh has op'd my Eyes; this Scene Of Death has undeceiv'd me.âBlind to think That there was any Ground, where Mortals tread, On which Affliction walks not!âEv'ry Clime Engenders human Woe; and fam'd Arcadia Is pregnant with the same disastrous Fortune That other Regions know. DORASTUS. Our Life, fair Lady, Must needs be chequer'd thus. LYSANDER. Alas! my Love, Let us enjoy the Good, nor with vain Search Anticipate Misfortune; come it will, Though Wisdom stand as Guard; and e'en these Shade. Must sometimes own its Pow'r. EUPHEMIA. Mistaken Maid! Is this the Land where Pleasure only reign'd? Was it for this I pac'd so long a Way? Abandon'd Sparta? and so far allur'd Thy wand'ring Steps, Lysander, here to meet The Face of Sorrow?âWhere is that Content Aranthe boasted? Where that Peace, she said Should greet our Coming?âAh! could she delude That Hope she so long nourish'd? DORASTUS. Heard I aright? Or did false Sounds abuse me?âSpake you not Of Sparta, and Aranthe, courteous Lady? Pray you say on; for to my Ear you utter'd A Name well known.âAranthe! knew you her? And lives she yet? LYSANDER. Ah no! she is no more! With pious Hand these Maidens clos'd her Eyes, Bathing her Corse with Tears. EUPHEMIA. In her I lost The best of Women, whose indulgent Care No Time shall wear away.âHer latest Wish Was I should seek Arcadia, where herself Had sometime known a happier Destiny Than Sparta's Walls afforded. DORASTUS. You are then Her daughter, doubtless; you perhaps have oft Heard her relateâ EUPHEMIA. Good Hermit, you mistake; I am no Child of her's, though many a Year Such I was deem'd, till her last Breath unveil'd The Error, and declar'd I was a Pledge Intrusted to her Care in infant Years, By whom was unexplain'd, for Death's cold Grasp Broke off th'unfinish'd Tale,âand I had walk'd The World, a friendless Orphan, and alone, But for this virtuous Youth, to whom I've giv'n That Love his Merit claim'd.âBut why on me Is cast that Look of Eagerness?âWhy heaves Thy lab'ring Bosom thus?âor whence those Tears That tremble in thine Eye? DORASTUS. O Nature!âNature! Who with thy pow'rful, and invisible Hand Shak'st my whole Frame with Tumult,âcan I think This Conflict, these Forebodings of a Father Are rais'd, or felt in vain?âThe Stroke's too great! Pray you your Arm a Moment.âYesâit mustâ Those Features wear the radiant Hue of Truth!â There cannot be Deceit.âIt isâIt is My long-lost Child restor'd.â EUPHEMIA. All-ruling Gods! Have ye upheld me through the Maze of Life Unknowing, and unknown, in this far Land To guide me to a Parent? LYSANDER. All's explain'd; This was Aranthe's Meaning, this the Cause She urg'd so strong your Coming, hoping still Some Chance might bring about this blest Event Th'indulgent Gods have prosper'd. DORASTUS. Gen'rous Youth! Whose Graces have endear'd thee to my Child, Whose Truth and Friendship won her, let my Arms Embrace thee as a Son.âA Father's Blessing, Pour'd from a Heart with Gratitude o'ercome, Shall now enforce the rest.âAlas! too quick My Spirits bound!âPrithee resolve my Mind A few fond Questions more. [They withdraw to the Bottom of the Stage. MUSIDORUS. See, my Children, The Virtuous still are happy!âThis is she So long reputed dead, for whom was rear'd The Statue, and the Tomb; for whom these Shades So oft' have echo'd with a Father's Sighs; Sighs now repaid with Transports! LAURA. Nor in vain Have we intwin'd the festive Wreath. This Night Shall social Pleasure beam from ev'ry Eye, And Sounds of Joy be heard along the Vale. DAPHNE. See where, returning from the hallow'd Grove, The Shepherds cross the Plain. I'll be myself Of this Event the Harbinger; 'twill prove Most welcome to them all. [Exit. DORASTUS, LYSANDER, EUPHEMIA, and DELIA, come forward. DORASTUS. Enough, enough; My stormy Life at last sinks to a Calm. Come Death now when it will, I'll meet it smiling, Upheld by this lov'd Pair. LYSANDER. Long live to see Our mutual happiness! and be repaid, In the bright Virtues of your new-found Daughter, The Suff'rings you've endur'd! DORASTUS. Great Providence! How just are all thy Ways!âNever let Man, Howe'er he be distress'd, abandon Hope; For in the Moment when the Cloud is blackest, When the big Storm rolls loudest o'er his Head, The Hand of Heav'n perhaps supports his Steps, And guides him back to Peace!â'Twas but this Morn, Stung with Remembrance of my former Woes, I curs'd the Sons of Sparta; ere Day close A Spartan Hand leads back the Child I lost, And quite atones the Wrongs his Country did me! EUPHEMIA. Justly I stand reprov'd.âHenceforth I'll own Each Murmur is a Crime, and Discontent Ingratitude to Heav'n. DORASTUS. Forbear to think This Earth can teem Perfection; Far beyond Those azure Rocks, that kiss the sloping Sky, A happier Region lies, to which compar'd Our Spot, is as the dank and tainted Gale To th'unsully'd Breath of Morning.âThere the Toils Of lab'ring Virtue cease! and thither oft' She turns her patient Eye, and seeks her Crown!â 'Tis there, Euphemia, and 'tis there alone Perfection may be hop'd; on this Side, all Is mutable and frail! EUPHEMIA. Yet 'tis not strange The Mind that's tutor'd to expect too much Should sigh at Disappointment. DORASTUS. That, my Child, Is Life's grand Error;âWe delude ourselves, And charge the Cheats of Fancy to the World.â Man in his visionary Hour conceives Joys never destin'd for him, then sits down In sullen Discontent, to think he loses That which he ne'er possess'd.âGo, wiser you My Children, curb your Wishes, taste with Thanks That Good the Gods allot you; and remember, Howe'er our Paths are chequer'd by Misfortune, Life still has many Pleasures for the Virtuous. MUSIDORUS. The neighb'ring Swains, whom Delia has inform'd Of what has chanc'd, with Looks of Transport haste To greet your happier Fortune. A Number of Arcadians enter with Daphne, and surround Dorastus with Marks of Congratulation. DORASTUS. Ah! how sweet Their Steps who speak of Peace!âI have, my Friends, A Heart that reads your Purpose in your Eye, And registers your LoveâA Heart, the Gods Have quite o'erwhelm'd with Mercy!âThanks to all Who share with me this Joy; and double Thanks To thee, kind Musidorus, whom this Night We all will sojourn with, and cheer the Board Thy lib'ral Hand has spread.âRich Flocks, and Herds, And wide-spread Pastures, shall be giv'n to-morrow In Dowry with this Maid.âYou, Delia, too Shall now become my Care.âLet us away, The Ev'ning Star is ris'n,âand as we pass Let all our choral Youth their Voices join In Notes that deep-felt Gratitude inspires. CHORUS. Mighty Pan! to Thee we owe All the Happiness we know;â Let our Lives still peaceful glide; Give us Virtue for our Guide. [Exeunt. EPILOGUE. Mortals, who this Drama view, Own you not its Moral true?â Virtuous Minds should ne'er despair; They are Heav'n's peculiar Care, Who teaches suff'ring Man to know Hope's the Counterpoise of Woe. But if Hope unlicens'd reigns, Wildly seeks ideal Plains, Pictures Joys it ne'er can meet, Paths ne'er trod by human Feet; Then, ah! then expect to find Arcadia's only in the Mind. TO The Messrs. ADAM, On their late successful Lottery. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXIV. As Genius and Merit indulg'd a short Sally, To mark the dull Wit and Abuse of Change-Alley, They saw the Weeds spring which by Envy were sown, And heard the shrill Clarion which Malice had blown; Tho' such Schemes to o'erthrow The Adelphi were laid, Yet unruffled they look'd, and walk'd on undismay'd Into Jonathan's Room, to see what was decided, Where o'er her own Wheels Madam Fortune presided; Who soon finding out that the Brothers were there, Bade them come from the Crowd, and sit down by her Chair: When thus she address'd them,ââI've mark'd with Delight âYour Patience, your Spirit, and both will requite; âNe'er regard the Abuse of this profligate Town, âThe Adelphi shall stand, and record your Renown, âTho' Men trump up each Day some incredible Story âTo tarnish your Fame, and o'ershadow your Glory; âYet not more to you, than to me they're unkind, âUndiscerning they call me, and still paint me blind, âSwear I foster the Fool, give the Worthless Success; âBut that all this is Scandal they now shall confess: So saying, her Bandage she tore from her Eyes, And gave to the Adams her most-valu'd Prize.â âThere, take it,â she cry'dââlet the World now declare âThat Genius and Merit henceforth are my Care; âGo, prosper againâShine unfetter'd and free, âWhilst Envy and Malice shall curse you and me.â EPILOGUE FOR THE First Part of HENRY IV. Acted at Mr. Newcomb's at Hackney, 1777. Spoken by Hostess Quickly. The Hostess is discovered in her Bar-Room leaning on a Tableâa Bell rings without several Times; FRANCIS the Drawer, after being repeatedly called for behind the Scenes, enters hastily. FRANCIS. Anon, AnonâI'm coming in a Crackâ Mistress, your KeysâSir John calls out for Sackâ He huffs and blusters, now the Battle's o'er, Ten Times as loud as e'er he did before! HOSTESS. A Murrain in his Gutsâthere is no Peace For this great Lump of Roguery and Greaseâ Go serve him, FrancisâI'll enjoy my Rest, [Exit Francis. Nor move for such a noisy, swaggering Guest.â There's not a Woman in Eastcheap, I'm sure, That could the Bustle I go thro', endure! The Prince, Heav'n bless him!âhe's so free and kind, He'd ev'ry Creature to his Service bind.â Sir John oft' says, perhaps 'tis but in Sport, When Hal is King, he'll send for one to Court.â Egad, and if he does, he need not fear [rises. But he'll have ta'en the right Sow by the Ear; Dame Quickly, as his Majesty shall see, Can be a Match for all the Quality.â First then, to give the Ton, and be polite, I'll sleep all Day, and go abroad all Night; For 'tis decreed there now can be no Fun, Spirit, or Joy, in aught beneath the Sun.â Next, to keep Pace with fashionable People, I'll have my Hair whirl'd up like our Church Steeple, Bolster'd and cramm'd with Wool, at least a Peck; Whilst Two great Sausage Curls shall cross my Neck: To rival e'en the highest I will venture, And of my Figure make my Face the Centre. Then shall my Crest with spangled Plumes be spread, And a whole Green Stall nod upon my Head; All Fruits and Flowers tooâfor 'tis but reason A Lady's Head should ever be in Season.â For a slim pinch'd-in Stay I'll change my Jump, And my Hips saddle with a nice Cork Rump; Thus thro' the Circles of the Gay I'll swing, And be from Top, to Bottom,âquite the Thing: Become a public Objectâpublic Toastâ And furnish Scandal for the Morning Post.â Then I'll send Cards to ev'ry Soul I know, No Matter who they are, or Friend, or Foe; They'll put their best Cloaths on, and swell my Show. Cards the best Knowledge of the World can teach, And render needless the eight parts of Speechâ All Sorts of Characters they mix together, Strange Birds, of ev'ry Nest, and ev'ry Feather. When one collects a Crowd of Young and Old, And twice as many as one's House should hold, Tho' each in turn is stifled, stew'd, and frighted, Nay squeez'd to Death, yet all go Home delighted.â But hold, Dame Quicklyâsay you this attain, Computeâand by the Change count what you'll gain.â Where is your Time for Rest? for Peace? for sleeping?â A Public House you surely still are keeping.â Egad, if that's the Caseâno Court for meâ I'll stay where Benchfulls of old Friends I see, My old Trade still in Eastcheap I'll pursue, And hope each Night such Customers as You. A PETITION FROM Mrs. DELANY's Citron-Tree To those who never have had the pleasure of seeing the valuable Work of Art of Mrs. Delany's, alluded to in these Lines, to make them the better understood, it will be necessary to inform the Reader, that this extraordinary Lady, at a very advanced period of Life, began a Flora, on a plan peculiarly her own, formed by applying coloured Papers together, so as to give the just representation of the Plant, or Flower she purposed to describe.âHer unwearied perseverance in this pursuit, hath in the course of about six years, made her the Authoress of by far the largest Flora that ever was executed by the same hand.âHer just attention to Nature, added to her great knowledge in Painting, have enabled her to produce such effects by this Invention, as Painting could hardly attain; such effects as those only, who have been eye-witnesses of her wonderful skill, can form any just Idea of.âThough this accomplishment, as well as the many others she possesses, are but the Embellishments of a character, which all the engaging Virtues of Life have rendered respectable. Mrs. Delany, whilst in Ireland, was presented with a Citron, the Seeds of which she had planted, and reared to a Tree, which, at the time of her leaving that kingdom, was in its perfection. When she was become enamoured of this new Work of her's, she often wished to perpetuate this Tree left behind her; and intimating such wish to the Dutchess Dowager of Portland,âher noble Friend, with that benevolence which distinguishes her exalted character, contrived to get the Tree sent over to Bullstrode.âWhen it was recovered from the accidents of so long a journey, it was placed in her Gallery; and on Mrs. Delany's being struck with the beauty of the Plant, she was informed by her Grace, that it was the identical Tree she had so long wished for. The Author having the honour of visiting Bullstrode, just as Mrs. Delany had finished the Portrait of a branch of her favorite Citron-Tree, and hearing the history of it, it excited in him the desire of commemorating an event, which gave him an opportunity of recording the Abilities of so amiable a Lady as Mrs. Delany, and the discerning and attentive Friendship of so distinguished a Character as the Dutchess Dowager of Portland., TO HER GRACE The Dutchess Dowager of Portland. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXVIII. Those who the ancient Bards explore, Know Trees have mov'd in Days of Yore, And, by the Pow'r of Music led, Have scamper'd from their native Bed. Thus Portland, by like magic Sway, Portland, whom all the Arts obey, Bless'd with the same harmonious Skill, Makes all Things migrate at her Will; Great Nature's Cells her Pow'r unlocks, Her Caverns opens, strips her Rocks, Tears from the Mine the ripen'd Ore, Calls ev'ry Shell from ev'ry Shore; Nor even can th' o'erwhelming Deep Its coral Beds, or Treasures keep, For Portland's Art unlinks the Chain That bound them in its wild Domain; Whilst Nature's Self o'erjoy'd beholds How she her secret Steps unfolds, Unravels ev'ry mystic Clue, And each Distinction points to View; With greater Charms than e'er could fire The boasted Notes of Orpheus' Lyre, Together bringing to our Wonder What Realms and Oceans plac'd asunder; Nor is it strangeâsince all agree True Taste is truest Harmony.â If Witness then of these your Pow'rs, If shelter'd too in Bullstrode's Bow'rs, Where Art and Nature both contend, And both their various Labors blend; If in your Gall'ry doom'd a Place, And station'd often near your Grace; None sure can wonder when they see Your Magic influence even me.â It op'rates far beyond Belief, I feel it now in ev'ry Leafâ Each Fibre quiversânay it shoots Down from my Blossoms to my Roots.â Yes, Noble Dame! your Arts prevail, And give me Force to tell my Tale; Force, your protecting Care to bless, And e'en my future Hopes express. From Citron-Groves on distant Shores, Round which the wide Atlantic roars, Torn from my Parent Tree, I came A little Seed consign'd to Fame; Consign'd to Fameâfor some kind Star, When from my Home I'd wander'd far, At last on fair Hibernia's Land Led me to Good Delany's Hand; Delany's Hand, whose Touch can give New Grace and Bloom,âshe bade me live.â I rooted, nor wish'd more to stir; And who would not, to live with Her?â Rear'd by her Smiles, I daily grew, And spread my Beauty to her View; But Plants, like Men, it is allow'd, Have all their Sunshine, and their Cloud! My friendly Guardian call'd away, On Britain's Coast to fix her Stay, My cheering Sunshine lost! no more My Leaves their wonted Verdure wore, No more with Joy my Blossoms spread, Sorrowing I droop'd, and hung my Head, 'Till gracious Portland deign'd to be Protectress of my Misery; Bade me once more the Ocean cross, My Spirits rais'd, retriev'd my Loss; And, ever be her Name ador'd, My Mistress to my Sight restor'd.â Whilst now I glow with wonted Charms, And Gratitude each Fibre warms, More favor'd sure no Plant can shine! But a still happier Lot is mine! For lo! your faithful Friend for me Prepares a glorious Destiny; She makes me on her Table rise, And notes me with inquiring Eyes, My Texture marks, my Form surveys, And views me with parental Gaze, Then with her artful Scissars traces My Shape, my Colour, and my Graces, Unlike what Poets give The Fates, For theirs destroy, but her's creates!â I see another Selfâand start, Shudd'ring with Wonder at her Art.â 'Tis doneâand she hath seal'd my Doom, And fix'd me in Eternal Bloom. So Bacchus once, as Bards relate, Compleated Ariadne's Fate, And, as short Life to Beauty's giv'n, Fix'd her a Starry Crown in Heav'n; Surrounded with a radiant Blaze, For future Worlds t'admire, and gaze.â Then, Noble Lady, may I sue, And one Request prefer to you? Whilst my own Fame I raptur'd trace, I feel a Wish for all my Race. O could my Sister Plants, and Flow'rs, That spring beneath your beauteous Bow'rs, Before the Good Delany stand, And share the Magic of her Hand! She'd give to others, as to me, A Kind of Immortality! To the Memory of Dr. JOHN HOADLY, Chancellor of Winchester. ADDRESSED TO RICHARD VERNON SADLEIR, Esq. When Themes of Joy the willing Muse invite, All Fancy's Regions open to her Sight, Sportive and unconstrain'd she glides along, And meditates at Ease her cheerful Song; Her teeming Thoughts with bright Conceptions glow, Ideas crowd, and Lines spontaneous flow.â Not so, when Sorrow bids her take the Lyre! The Pow'rs of Fiction then no more inspire; The sad Reality that wrings her Heart O'erclouds her Spirit, and impedes her Art; Sighs check the Verse she would to Friendship pay, And Tears bedew her tributary Lay. To you, dear Sadleir, on whose lib'ral Breast Her tend'rest Touches Nature hath imprest, Whose gen'rous Mind feels ev'ry Suff'rer's Ills, Whose virtuous Course each social Duty fills, These Lines I dedicateâFor well you know What to a Friend so dearâso lov'dâwe owe; To You, who shar'd with me his serious Hours, And the wide Compass of his sprightly Pow'rs; Saw by his Life Religion's Charms convey'd, And the good Man in ev'ry Act display'd. England must long revere a Hoadly's Name, Thy Prelate, Winchester, hath fix'd its Fame! Meek, unaspiring, virtuous, and sincere, Firm in Opinion, in his Tenets clear, Fearless, a literary War he wag'd, And Prejudice and Error both engag'd; Tho' Party-Rage his Doctrines loud assail'd, He wrote for Truthâand in her Cause prevail'd; And, full of Days and Honor, liv'd to see Th'enlighten'd Realm by what he taught, more free; Liv'd, in that Friend, whom now we mourn, t'admire All that parental Fondness could desire; A Son, who clos'd his Eyes, who o'er him rear'd The Record of a Father he rever'd; And, Lot severe to us! was by Heav'n's Will Doom'd the same Grave himself so soon to fill!â And shalt thou, Gentle Spirit! sink to Dust, And I survive?ânor to thy Worth be just? Shall it be only water'd by those Eyes Which with fresh Tears thy widow'd Love supplies? Shall her fond Heart, to all thy Virtues true, Alone with Sighs those Virtues lost review? Forbid it FriendshipâEv'ry Muse forbid In the dark Tomb that Hoadly's Name be hid, Who liv'd a favor'd Suitor of ye all, For ev'ry Muse with Pleasure heard his Call.â Engaging Hoadly!âThe rare Lot was thine, Or grave, or gay, transcendently to shine! Thy ready Pen could picture deep Distress, Or all the Force of comic Life impress; Folly and Vice with Satire keen alarm, Tho' rarely us'd thy Wit, unless to charm!â But why erect thy Fame on shining Parts? 'Twas thine to win, nay, captivate all Hearts: Thy happy Spirits flow'd in steady Course, From the pure Spring of Virtue's sacred Source; It was thy Wish to check each Mourner's Sigh, Thy Aim to wipe the Tear from ev'ry Eye; And to such Views the noblest Triumph's giv'n, E'en here on Earth begins the hop'd-for Heav'n!â Thy Looks serene announc'd that Triumph gain'd; Peace and Benevolence in Smiles there reign'd. 'Midst Pains severe still cheerful and resign'd! Tho' bow'd thy Body, yet unbent thy Mind! Calmly consid'ring Death as a Repose; And when the Mortal sunk,âthe Angel rose!â Spirit Benign! enjoy a hallow'd Rest! Thy Worth acknowledg'd, and thy Mem'ry blest. And oft, my Sadleir, when our Hoadly's Loss Shall be our Theme, and Life's gay Moments cross, Oft as his absent Friendship we deplore; (And who have better known?âwho lov'd him more?) Let us, since fleeting Time so rapid flies, And rends the brittle Chain of human Ties, This strength'ning Link broke off, with firmer Clasp Those Parts which yet remain unsever'd, grasp.â In the sweet Counsels of congenial Minds, Man still the surest Source of Comfort finds: Be it our Aim, that, e'en to Life's Extreme, Nor Change, nor Chance shall lessen our Esteem; Of one Dear Friend by Fate's Decree bereft, We'll value more the few we still have left. A NUPTIAL ODE, ADDRESSED TO A FRIEND, On the Marriage of his Daughter. WRITTEN IN M.DCC.LXXX. I Sweet is the Music of the Muse's Lyre, When splendid Themes her magic Notes inspire, Whether she sings embattled Hosts, And gives to perish'd Annals Fame, Or of some favor'd Hero boasts, And raptur'd, consecrates his Name, Or bids obedient Passions wait her Call, The Sigh to Sorrow heave, the Tear to Mis'ry fall! II But far more sweet her Song, when all her Art Aims to give Transport to the human Heart; When she in soothing Strains reveals Whate'er sublimest Virtue knows, All that each soft Affection feels, And Life's most happy Hour bestows, With Reason's Voice the Woes of Man disarms, Paints Love's exalted Joys, and Friendship's sacred Charms. III With ravish'd Eye she views this Festive Day, And dedicates to Thee, my Friend, her Lay.â She marks the Torch of Hymen blaze, And sees around the chosen Band, And Thee, with fond parental Gaze, Lead up a Daughter by the Hand, All rob'd in White, with Looks of artless Truth And ev'ry blushing Grace that waits on virgin Youth. IV Such modest Semblance Virtue only wears, And such alone th'ingenuous Mind declares; Then onward lead herâAnxious waits The Bridegroom to receive his Prize, While ev'ry Hope his Breast elates, And Transport dances in his Eyes; To Honor's noblest Feelings ever true, A Lover worthy HerâA Choice most worthy You. V Now at the Altar, lo! the Ring is giv'n, The mutual Vow is pledg'dâConfirm it Heav'n!â Genii, who conduct our Pleasures, Join the Hymeneal Train, Pour around them Love's best Treasures, Heart to Heart still more enchain; And let the Muse, twining the Myrtle Wreath, To Thee, my valu'd Friend, her fond Prediction breath. VI Oh! if aright she reads the Book of Fate, New Joys for thee shall This Day's Act create; The Virtues of this wedded Pair Shall warm your Hopes, shall live your Theme; The Future, brightest Sunshine wear, The Past, be shadow'd as a Dream; To Thee, each Mark of cordial Love be shown, And they, like me, shall prize, that Worth I long have known. ADVICE TO A LITTLE GIRL, The Author's Daughter, On her being honored with some Instruction By Mrs. DELANY In cutting out Paper. WRITTEN AT BULLSTRODE, M.DCC.LXXX. With that Benevolence which condescends To glide its Knowledge to the youthful Heart, O'er thee, my Child, the Good Delany bends, Directs thy Scissars, and reveals her Art. Ah! seize the happy Moment!âShe can shew The mazy Path mysterious Nature treads; Can steal her varied Grace, her varied Glow, And all the changeful Beauties that she spreads. Then mark thy kind Instructress, watch her Hand, Her Judgment, her inspiring Touch attain; Thy Scissars, make like her's, a Magic Wand!â Tho' much I fear thy Efforts will be vain.â Failing in this, my Child, forbear the Strife; Another Path to Fame by her is shown;â Try by the Pattern of her honor'd Life, With equal Virtue to cut out thine own.
