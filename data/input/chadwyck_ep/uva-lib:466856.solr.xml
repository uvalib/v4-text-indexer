Elton Rectory, Christmas Eve. M.DCCC.XLIV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Only two selected poems from the sequence are reproduced here. The remainder already appear elsewhere in English Poetry. I. THE ROSARY OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST. PARAPHRASED FROM THE âParadisus Animae Christianae.â Father! Creator! Lord Most High! Sweet Jesu! Fount of Clemency! Blest Spirit! who dost sanctify! God ruling over all! The Dolours Christ did once endure, O grant that I, with spirit pure, Devoutly may recall. Jesu! Thou didst a Mother choose, Whose Seed the serpent's head should bruise, Seed of a Virgin womb; O! bruise that serpent now in me, Bruise him, good Lord! that I may be Thine at the Day of Doom. Jesu! the saints in spirit soar Where angels hymn for evermore The Judge who shall appear; Receive a suppliant that would raise His voice unto that choir of praise, But is half mute through fear. I believe in God, etc. DECAD FIRST. THE INFANCY AND YOUTH OF OUR SAVIOUR TILL HIS BAPTISM. Jesu! who from Thy throne didst come, And man's most vile estate assume, Our fallen race to lift, O! grant that such transcending love To me, through Thine own grace, may prove No ineffectual gift. Our Father, etc. I Jesu! whom Mary once conceived Through grace, her backward fears relieved By angels' salutation, May I, within a chastened heart, Conceive Thee, Living Word, who art My God and my Salvation. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. II Jesu! whom Thy sweet Mother bore To St. Elizabeth of yore, On Jewry's mountain lea; O! mayst Thou oft, in ways concealed, To heart but not to eye revealed, Vouchsafe to visit me. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. III Jesu! kind visitant of earth, Of sinless and of painless birth, Thy Mother's only-born, May love with undiverted flame Ascend, and for Thy glorious Name All other nuptials scorn. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IV Jesu! the spacious world was Thine, Yet, when Thou wouldst Thy Head recline, It scarce found room for Thee; And O, shall sinful man be bent On self-sought greatness, not content With Christlike poverty! Hail, Jesus! pray for us. V Jesu! whom the shepherds sought An Infant, by the Angels taught From out the midnight sky, O may I love Thy praise on earth, That I may one day share the mirth Of angel hosts on high. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VI Jesu! my God and Saviour, Thou, Sinless, didst as a sinner bow To ordinance divine; O curb my loose and wandering eyes, Prune my self-will, and circumcise This carnal heart of mine. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VII Jesu! before Thy manger, kings Lay prostrate with their offerings, A most unworldly throne; Thou to my cradle camest, Lord, With gifts invisibly outpoured From waters of Thine own. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VIII Jesu! whom Thy meek Mother vowed To God, whose law would have allowed Her first-born to go free, O give me such a humble mind, That in obedience I may find The choicest liberty. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IX Jesu! sweet fugitive, who fled From Herod's bloody net outspread For Thy dear Infancy, Give me, O Lord, like modest care To fly the world when it speaks fair, To steal Thy grace away. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. X Jesu! whom Thy sad Mother sought, And in the temple found, who taught The aged in Thy youth; How blest are they who keep aright, Or find, when lost, the living light Of Thine eternal truth! Hail, Jesus! pray for us. O Creator, hear thy creatures, Saviour, hear us when we pray; Thou who dost renew our natures, Good Spirit! give us hearts to say, Deus meus et omnia! DECAD SECOND. THE LIFE OF OUR SAVIOUR TILL HIS PASSION. Jesu! the Father's words approve His Son in Jordan, while the Dove, Bright Witness, hovers down; So wash me, Lord, that I may be At the great day approved of Thee, Before Thy Father's throne. Our Father, etc. I Jesu! who in the strength of fast, Through Adam's three temptations passed, On Adam's trial-ground. In me let hallowed abstinence The issues seal of carnal sense, And Satan's wiles confound. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. II Jesu! Thou didst the fishers call, Who straightway at Thy voice left all, To teach the world of Thee; May I with ready will obey Thine inward call, and keep the way Of Thy simplicity. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. III Jesu! who deigndst to be a guest, Where Mary's gently-urged behest With Thy kind power made free, May I mine earthly kinsfolk love, In such pure ways, that I may prove My greater love for Thee. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IV Jesu! how toiled Thy blessed Feet, O'er hill and dale and stony street, Through weary want and pain! O may I rather for Thy sake The hardships Thou hast hallowed take Than joys Thou didst disdain Hail, Jesus! pray for us. V Jesu! in all the zeal of love How amiably didst Thou reprove Poor wretches lost in sin! Ah! may I first in penance live, Rebuking self, then humbly strive My brother's soul to win. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VI Jesu! who didst the multitude Twice nourish with miraculous food Of soul and body both, Give me my daily bread, O Lord, Thy Flesh, Thyself, Incarnate Word, Which feeds our heavenly growth. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VII Jesu! gracious truth revealing, Sorrow soothing, sickness healing, And so requiting hate! O grant that I may ever be Like-minded, blessed Lord, with Thee, And envy no man's state. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VIII Jesu! transfigured on the height Of Tabor in mysterious light From Heaven's eternal fountain, If such the earthly type, O lead, Lead me where Thou Thy flock dost feed Upon the holy mountain. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IX Jesu! who wept o'er Salem's towers, Wept for her long and baleful hours Of misery and sin! O Love Divine, could I but borrow From Thy sweet strength such strength of sorrow As might her pardon win! Hail, Jesus! pray for us. X Jesu! and do I now behold My God, my Saviour, bought and sold, A traitor's merchandize? O grant that I may never be A Judas, dearest Lord, to Thee, For all that earth supplies. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. O Creator, hear thy creatures, Saviour, hear us, when we pray; Thou who dost renew our natures, Good Spirit! give us hearts to say, Deus meus et omnia! DECAD THIRD. THE PASSION OF OUR SAVIOUR TILL HIS CRUCIFIXION. Jesu! who deemdst it not unmeet To wash Thine own disciples' feet, Though Thou wert Lord of all; Teach me thereby this wisdom meek, That they who self-abasement seek Alone shall fear no fall. Our Father, etc. I Jesu! who Thy true Flesh didst take Upon the Paschal night, and break For our most precious Food, O Living Bread, be Thou my strength Through which the world and flesh, at length, In me may be subdued. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. II Jesu! who in the garden felt The bloody sweat, yet patient knelt To do Thy Father's will, To me give such a zealous mind To suffer, such a heart resigned Thy statutes to fulfil. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. III Jesu! Thy friends are fain to sleep, While to the unresisting Sheep The cruel wolves repair; May I be found as meek and still By those who wish or work me ill, And, like my Lord, at prayer. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IV Jesu! who sawst on that sad night Thine own, Thy chosen, take to flight, And leave their Lord by stealth; O may we learn in grief and care Those harder trials still to bear, Prosperity and wealth. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. V Jesu! who deeply silent stood Before the accusing multitude, Do Thou my tongue control, Set on my busy lips Thy seal; Ascetic silence oft can heal The sickness of the soul. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VI Jesu! whom Peter then denied, Thou with one gentle look didst chide The weak disciple's fears; If ever I deny Thy Name, Thy Cross, O send me speedy shame, O give me Peter's tears. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VII Jesu! The Judge of quick and dead, Thyself, when falsely judged, wert led In mock regalia clad; May I my solemn office fill, Judge of myself, and think no ill, Not even of the bad. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VIII Jesu! scourged and buffeted And spit upon, Thy sacred Head Was bow'd to earth for me; O may I pardon find, and bliss, And expiating love in this My Lord's indignity. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IX Jesu! with crown of ruddy thorn The Jews Thy tortured Brow adorn, And, jeering, hail Thee king; May I, O Lord, with heart sincere My humble zeal, my love and fear, A real homage bring. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. X Jesu! for whom the wicked Jews A vile and blood-stained robber choose, Have mercy, Lord, on me, And keep me from a choice so base As taking wealth or ease or place, Barabbas, Lord! for Thee. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. O Creator! hear Thy creatures, Saviour! hear us when we pray; Thou who dost renew our natures, Good Spirit! give us hearts to say Deus meus et omnia! DECAD FOURTH. THE CRUCIFIXION, AND WHAT WAS DONE UPON THE CROSS. Jesu! along Thy proper road Of sorrows, with Thy weary Load How didst thou toil and strain! O may I bear the Cross like Thee, Or rather Lord, do Thou in me The blessed weight sustain. Our Father, etc. I Jesu! on that most doleful day How were Thy garments stripped away, Thy holy Limbs laid bare! O may no works or ways unclean Despoil me of that modest mien Thy servants, Lord, should wear. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. II Jesu! what direst agony Was Thine, upon the bitter tree, With healing virtues rife! O may I count all things but loss, All for the glory of the Cross, The sinner's Tree of Life. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. III Jesu! around Thy sacred Head There is an ominous brightness shed, The Name which Pilate wrote; Save us, Thou royal Nazarene! For in that Threefold Name are seen The gifts Thy Passion brought. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IV Jesu! who to the Father prayed For those who all Thy love repaid With this dread cup of woes, Teach me to conquer, Lord, like Thee, By patience and benignity, The thwarting of my foes. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. V Jesu! who, come to seek and save, Absolved the thief, and promise gave Of peace among the blest, Ah! do Thou give me penitence Like his, that I, when summoned hence In Paradise may rest. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VI Jesu! who bade the virgin John Thy Mother take, when Thou wert gone, And in Thy stead to be, Oh when I yield my parting breath Be Thou beside me, and in death, Good Lord, remember me. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VII Jesu! true Man, who cried aloud Toward the ninth hour, My God, My God, O why am I forsaken? Lord! may I never fall from Thee, Nor e'en in life's extremity My humble trust be shaken. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VIII Jesu! athirst, the soldiers think To mock Thee, giving Thee to drink What might inflame Thy pain; Ah! mindful of the loathsome draught Which for my sins my Saviour quaffed May I my flesh restrain. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IX Jesu! Redeemer, all the price Of Adam's sin Thy sacrifice Did more than fully pay; May I my stewardship fulfil With equal strictness, and Thy will With scrupulous love obey. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. X Jesu! Thy Passion at an end, Thou didst Thy blameless soul commend Unto the Father's care, When my last hour is come, may I Hasten with meek alacrity To do Thy will elsewhere. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. O Creator! hear Thy creatures, Saviour! hear us when we pray; Thou who dost renew our natures, Good Spirit! give us hearts to say Deus meus et omnia! DECAD FIFTH. WHAT WAS DONE AFTER HIS DEATHâBURIAL, RESURRECTION, ASCENSION, SESSION, AND SECOND ADVENT. Jesu! all-hail, who for my sin Didst die, and by that death didst win Eternal life for me, Send me Thy grace, good Lord! that I Unto the world and flesh may die, And hide my life with Thee. Our Father, etc. I Jesu! from out Thine opened Side Thou hast the thirsty world supplied With endless streams of love; Come ye who would your sickness heal, Draw freely from that sacred well, Its heavenly virtues prove. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. II Jesu! Thy Passion's bitter smart Pierced like a sword Thy Mother's heart As Simeon prophesied, So fix my heart unto Thy Cross That I may count all gain but loss For Jesus Crucified! Hail, Jesus! pray for us. III Jesu! in spices wrapped, and laid Within the garden's rocky shade, By jealous seals made sure, Embalm me with Thy grace, and hide Thy servant in Thy wounded Side, A heavenly sepulture! Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IV Jesu! who to the spirits went, And preached the new enfranchisement Thy recent death had won, Absolve me, Lord! and set me free From self and sin, that I may be Bondsman to Thee alone. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. V Jesu! who from the dead arose And straightway sought to comfort those Whose weak faith mourned for Thee, O may I rise from sin and earth, And so make good that second birth Which Thou hast wrought in me. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VI Jesu! who wert at Emmaus known In breaking bread, and thus art shown Unto Thy people now, O may my heart within me burn, When at the Altar I discern Thy Body, Lord! and bow. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VII Jesu! amid yon olives hoar, Thy forty days of sojourn o'er, Thou didst ascend on high, O thither may my heart and mind Ascend, their home and harbor find With Jesus in the sky. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. VIII Jesu! ten silent days expired, The Eternal Spirit came, and fired With his celestial heat Thine infant Church, O may that light Within one pasture now unite Our widely wandering feet. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. IX Jesu! who at this very hour At God's Right Hand in pomp and power Our nature still dost wear, O with the Spirit intercede Before the Father, Lord! and plead Thy countless merits there. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. X Jesu! who shalt in glory come With angels to the final doom, Men's works and wills to weighâ Since from that pomp I cannot flee, Be pitiful, great Lord! to me In that tremendous day. Hail, Jesus! pray for us. O Creator! hear Thy creatures, Saviour! hear us when we pray; Thou who dost renew our natures, Good Spirit! give us hearts to say Deus meus et omnia! Rome. The Eve of St. Barnabas, 1843. Villa Strozzi. XII. The Willow Island. I Prince Amadis lay in a chestnut brake By the side of Locarno's silver lake: It seems a very long while ago, Or else it may be that time goes slow. II Those were the days when the world of spirit Filled the old earth to the brim, or near it; And marvels were wrought by wizard elves, Which happen but rarely among ourselves. III The heart of prince Amadis did not pant With an indwelling love, or blameless want Of chivalrous friendship, or thirst of power; His youth was enough for its own bright hour. IV He floated o'er life like a noon-tide breeze, Or cradled vapor on sunny seas, Or an exquisite cloud, in light arrayed, Which sails through the sky and can throw no shade. V Wishes he had, but no hopes and no fears; He smiled, but his smiles were not gendered of tears: Like a beautiful mute he played his part, Too happy by far in his own young heart! VI His twentieth summer was well nigh past, Each was more golden and gay than the last; The glory of earth, which to others grows dim, Through his unclouded years glittered fresher to him. VII And oh how he loved! From the hour of his birth, He was gentle to all the bright insects of earth; He sate by the green gilded lizards for hours, And laughed, for pure love, at the shoals of pied flowers. VIII As he walked through the woods in the cool of the day, He stooped to each blossom that grew by the way He tapped at the rind of the old cedar trees, When its weak breath had sweetened the evening breeze. IX He knew all the huge oaks, the wide forest's gems, By their lightning-cleft branches or sisterly stems; He knew the crowned pines where the starlight is best, And the likeliest banks where the moon would rest. X He studied with joy the old mossy walls, And probed with his finger their cavernous halls, Where the wren builds her nest and the lady-bird slumbers While winter his short months of icy wind numbers. XI All things were holy and dear to his mindâ All things,âexcept the hot heart of his kind, And that seemed a flower in a withered hood, Which the cold spring cankered within the bud. XII The wrongs of the peasant, the woes of the peer Ne'er wrung from the prince a true sigh or a tear; The strife of his fellows seemed heartlessly bright, Like the laurels in winter in cold moonlight. XIII He cared for no sympathy, living in throngs Of his own sunny thoughts, and his mute inward songs; And if in the sunset his spirit was weary, Sleep was hard by him, young health's sanctuary. XIV 'Twould not have been so had he e'er known his mother, Or had had, save the green earth, a playmate and brother; For deep in his heart a most wonderful power Of loving lay hid, like an unopened flower. XV Ah! luckless it is when a spirit is haunted By all kindly powers, but attractions are wanted, Life's outward attractions, by calm, pensive law Love, sorrow, and pity from shy hearts to draw! XVI Yet mid the voluptuous forms of delight, Whose footfalls stole round him by day or by night, He was chaste as the white lily's dew-beaded cup, Which, bold because stainless, to heaven looks up. XVII His mind was a fair desert temple of beauty, Unshaded by sorrow, unhallowed by duty; A dream in a garden, a midsummer bliss Was the youth, the bright youth, of prince Amadis. XVIII Prince Amadis lay in the chestnut shade Where the flickering light through the green leaves played, And the summer lake, with its blue heart throbbing, Chafed the white sand with a reedy sobbing. XIX He saw not the hills through his half-closed eye, But their presence was felt like a spirit nigh; To the spell of the noon-tide he gave himself up, And his heart overflowed like wine in a cup. XX He smiled at the silence that stole o'er the day, While the singing-birds slumbered upon the spray, Till moss-scented airs o'er the green sward did creep, And tremulous mallow-leaves fanned him asleep. XXI And dreams whispered to him, the tongues of sweet flowers Striking the chimes of the uncounted hours; And, as though he were sinless, the wood-haunting creatures Bent o'er the sleeper with love in their features. XXII Sleeping or waking, his vision was one,â That the knots of the world might by him be undone, That the Natures below and the Spirits above Might with man be confused in one Eden of love. XXIII Beautiful dreamer! how far hadst thou strayed From the love at thy doors by the meek earth laid, And the household chains of our true love rent, Which were forged for the soul's enfranchisement! XXIV The day drifted out, like the ebb of the ocean, From the havens of earth with a quiet motion; And a cool flapping breeze grew out of the air Which the mallow-leaves fanned to the sleeper there. XXV Prince Amadis rose from the flowery brake, While, imaged serenely in the lake, The roseate sky, with gold bars freaked, By a flight of wild swans was duskily streaked. XXVI In a stiff-bending line through the rich sunset They wavered like cloud-spots of glossy jet, And with rude piping they marshalled their rear In a phalanx above the tranquil mere. XXVII There for one moment their huge wings they shake, Then in wide spiral circuits drop down to the lake; The dark water gurgles, thus suddenly cloven, In wakes of white bubbles interwoven. XXVIII Are there deep instincts that lurk below In those dipping breasts of driven snow? Or why do they steer their conscious way To the prince in the mallow-curtained bay? XXIX A pale-feathered cygnet was with them, and he Swam centre of all the company, And round him they anchored in that calm pool, A vision solemn and beautiful. XXX He wore on his head a black diadem, Looped to a clasp of orange gem; His plumage gleamed in the dusk star-bright, Of purple but faintly muffled with white. XXXI There needed no voices: prince Amadis read A dream in that show interpreted; He strode the fair cygnet, and rose from the ground With those wild white swans on a voyage bound. XXXII Young prince! they will search for thee all through the night, And the lake and the bush will gleam wan with torchlight; And there will be weeping and wailing then, If monarchs have hearts like other men. XXXIII But away and away in the midnight blue That fleet of white creatures went steering through; And away and away through the sweet day-break, From the white Alps flashed, their road they take: XXXIV Through the tingling noon and the evening vapor, Which Hesper lights with his little taper, Through the tremulous smiles of moonlight mirth, And the balmy descents of dew to the earthâ XXXV Through the calms, through the winds, when the hailstones ring, The convoy passed with untiring wing, And oft from their course for hours they drove As though they winnowed the air for love. XXXVI And now they would mount, and now they would stoop, And almost to earth or ocean droop, And harshly would pipe through the sheer delight Of their boisterous wings, and the strength of flight. XXXVII They saw the young Save in the next night's moon, They were over Belgrade by the afternoon, And ere the sun set their journey was o'er On a yellow rock by the Danube's shore. XXXVIII They left the young prince, (for their mission was done,) There on the tall yellow summit alone; And, in their hoarse language they bade him farewell, And swept o'er the sun-bleached Bulgarian fell. XXXIX More and more sadly as daylight died, The breeze-troubled marsh-plants sobbed and sighed, And the pulse of the river with bubbling sound Beat in the swamps and the hollows round. XL But the stream travelled on like a pilgrim weary In search of his eastern sanctuary, Through the heart of old Europe guiding his floods From beneath the green boughs of the Freybourg woods.
