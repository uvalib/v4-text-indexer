      <field name="fulltext">WENDELINE. An English Rosebud without Thorns. I hail alike the good and ill, And when gray sorrows do rise up They take the moulding of my will, As troubled waters in a cup. But it is thou, O magic maid, Repairing every broken string, By whose unconscious art and aid I learned to conquer so and sing. SECTION I. English Roses. PRELUDE. Englishwoman with the gray blue eyes, Like a sunburst in our blue gray skies Breaking through the misty dome; Tried by flame in Indian shambles, Proved in iron Arctic frost; But however torn and tost, Worthy of your country's great preambles And in every place at home. Others wear more dazzling charms, You are thorny like your native brambles; But you have the warm wide mother's arms, Unto which all children come. Englishwoman, with the pure sweet eyes Full of purpose and proud mysteries, God has made no truer thing; In the teeth of shipwreck's ordeal tested, And by earthquake's awful shock Weighed and found of granite rock, With the grandeur of your race invested And with what enrobes a king. But accessible and soft in all Modest ways and ever honey-breasted To the sufferer's feeblest call, With divine compassioning. Englishwoman, with the grave clear eyes, Wherein light of each good feeling lies, As its lustre on the star; Final work and flower of the Creator, Blooming still more sure and bright In the gardens of the night And upon the tomb's dim dreadful crater, Or through sorrow's blur and scar. Ah, we know and trust thy dainty strength, Over flood and fire arising greater Till it guides us into port at length, Though astray we be afar. Englishwoman, with the wondrous eyes Portals of unknown immensities, Leading us to heaven and home; Time can show no better force for shaping Than the cunning of thy hand Made to conquer and command, Which redecks the earth with finer draping And illumes the sky's dark dome. Rule us still, for ever crowned and coy, With thy beauty which is the escaping Of the glory in that blessed joy, Unto which we all would come. MY RED ROSE. Though many flowers may smile on me And paint the deepest night, Yet must I only look at thee, Red Rose, my one delight; When thou art close, I cannot see Another face though fair it be, Because thou art so bright. The Pansy has a perfect grace Which doth around me twine, And in the Lily's turn I trace A purity divine; But in thy bridal chamber space Each beauty has a dwelling place, And every gift is thine. What eye in pleasure would not dwell On that embodied blush, To which as in a crowning spell Creation seems to rush? And who, howe'er he knows thee well, In melody or tale might tell That heaven within thy hush? The curve and colour of thy shape, Elsewhere I do not mark; It weds the glory on the grape And secret of the dark; The crimsons in which poppies drape, Sunrise and moonrise all escape From that celestial spark. Unearthly fragrance from thee falls And to each petal clings, Which girds thee as with fairy walls And soft enchanted things; Thy breath to praise and worship calls, And turns the hut to palace halls With magic which it brings. And he who once has lingered near Thy rapture keen as pain, Can nevermore be touched by fear Or any earthly stain; He carries balm for toil and tear And music which none else can hear, Nor stoops to ill again. And I who of thy fulness drink A passion deep and long, Now do not waver on the brink Of madness or the wrong; Each bond is but a golden link Wherein with God himself I think, And every footstep song. Thou shalt not die, a better birth Does in thy passing wake, Who giveth all a sacred girth That mortals cannot make; Which joins our misery to mirth, And marries us to Heaven; and earth Is sweeter, for thy sake. And not thy humblest part, the thorn Which pierces if we try Or handle without heed in scorn Thy radiant ecstacy; Then only, chastened thus and torn, My blindness opes to the blue morn Which is Eternity But rooted in a generous soil Thou likest more the East, And in our human care and coil Thy lesson is not least; And he who triumphs in his toil Or rises splendid with the spoil, Finds thee a richer feast. O more than fair, immortal Rose, In thy rejoicing red So faultless in its final pose, I see a holy bed For maiden bosoms and for those That walk with truth, which might enclose Divinity's own Head. And thou, my Red Rose, sweetest heart, For ever fond and true, The perfume of whose life has part To all that's dear and due, Dost breathe a blessing on each smart That smiles beneath thy touch, and art To Heaven my happy clue. ROSA MUNDI. Rosa Mundi— Somewhere bright and somewhere sweet With a nation at your feet; Dainty morsel, not a common Salmagundi, For a monarch fair and meet— Rosa Mundi! I shall never see that beauty Which is just the dress of duty Sitting on you softly, well; In the bosom's swoon and swell, And the shoulder With a shaping white and innocent and bolder, And the rounding of the dainty cheek and chin Smooth and smiling beyond art And a sculptor's power and part, Beautiful to sense as sin; Sitting on you truly, lightly, As the colour on the flower, As the moonshine on the tower, As its lustre on the star— Swaying slightly; As the fire-bloom on the scar, Brought by saintly souls who travelled down to hell Just for others, Virgin wives and maiden mothers, And adventured right through the great burning bar In the sureness Of their pureness, And came back serene and pale— Living yet—to tell the tale. But I never ask for vision Of your face, Or the falling of those feet With their wanton indecision And a miracle of grace, Like the glow flakes Of the snow flakes Tinged by sunbeams coy and fleet, Hesitating down to earth and dropping calm On the upturned tiny palm Of a baby's blessed hand; Or the studied Shy simplicity of gestures Waved about you like command, And the stainlessness of priestly rites and vestures By our outer world unmuddied. No, I never Wish to see you, Rosa Mundi; Nor would I make one endeavour To behold you ere the hour, When the spirit bursts in flower And puts off this clogging flesh, As the passing moon and sun die And we break in glory from our prison mesh. If I were indeed admitted Just to the half-showing haze Of a dim and distant gaze And the uttermost far court, I should be a life unfitted And a moment's toy and sport. O the veiled and mystic flashes Of your cruel comeliness and spotless charms And the tyrannous proud arms, Worse than lightning, With their curtained breath and bright'ning Ooze of splendour, would consume my heart to ashes. But I would in no wise come where You are throned, And enzoned With a worship worthy of your awful dower; Yet I know that you are somewhere, Beautiful and blest, a power Summing in your central seat All that can be delicate and most delicious, Made of heavy gold-brown tresses And the white-pink lovelinesses Melting in the bosom's beat, And the mouth of red propitious; Somewhere crownèd By divinest right of merit, As a Queen who doth inherit Every goodness, every gift, Which becomes a figure gownèd Perfectly and not by thrift; Just as if its pleasant robes Were a portion Of the exquisite pure bust and pouting lips, Wedded as warm lips to lips, Or as dusky lashes to their blue-gray globes— And no milliner's distortion. This is quite enough for me, Rosa Mundi, Fairer than fair Cleopatra Or whoever now is, sweetest And completely incompletest, From the little isle of Lundy To the furnace of Sumatra; Just to know you are a living form and fragrance, Moulded as no sculptor could Carve in richest womanhood, And a breathing Pulse of passion's fiery vagrance Bodied in a web of nerves And most cunning hues and curves, With a kind of halo's gentle dim enwreathing. I can picture you at night, In a terrible clear light Making, breaking Destinies of men and cities, Not without immortal pities Trembling in your dream-füll eyes, Like the far gleam And the star gleam Of yet unarisen skies; Acting history, Turning nations and the individual's weakness Into any show or shape, As one might a silken cape— But, amid the plastic meekness, You, a mystery. Sometimes in the sultry noon. All ablaze with quivering light, When great secret forces fight (As not ever mortal men did) Into open bounty of their languorous boon, Fancy sees you, Fancy flees you Unapproachably removed and darkly splendid; And a thousand thousand lustres Speak and sparkle and contend On your brow and scarlet lips And from dazzling night of heavenly hair descend, Till with coruscating clusters On my soul drops down eclipse. Love's own Lady, In the gleams Of a world of sunlit streams, You are welcome, you are royal, And they subject are and loyal; While in shy retreats and shady Corners, you are likewise fit With your countless moods and modes Quite beyond our common codes, Fathomless and infinite. Rosa Mundi, Never shall your works begun die, Though we ail and fail and falter Ere the winnings, Or faint-hearted pule and palter With magnificence of sinnings; You must carry On the glorious labour as you only can, Ministering to lonely man By the beauty, by the bliss Of the wedded clasp or kiss; If you tarry Now and then, and grudge those favours Which are all our life's sweet savours. You are just what each one wishes, Every mother's son is sure (If no other joys endure) You will satisfy his heart With the honey-due soft dishes Which love only may impart. So you are most ripe and real, Though ideal, To the love-sick and forlorn And will be to breasts unborn Still the same, Fuel of a deathless flame In the temple of the universal soul, Past the compass and the map of our control. You are just what each one fancies, Night or day, Grave or gay, The delight of his romances; For his converse, at his call, Staid and steady, Romping-ready, And the one desire of all. In the darling of our choice, In the burden of our voice You are regnant; We behold you And enfold you. In your naked charms and graces Pure, yet pregnant With the homage of unnumbered times and places; Out of light and out of darkness Shadowed, shining, But refining Whatso'er you touch or take— Till the stoniest lot and starkness, To a gentle life awake; Proud or mild, With the wisdom of the ages And philosophies of sages, But not less a woman child; Matron, maid With her hidden passion blushing and afraid. Ah, to me you are divinity Clear, consummate, and my own; Lovely, loveable, infinity, Of my flesh and blood outgrown Part and parcel, yet unknown Whitest blossom of virginity; Goddess, earthly, sole and separate and far Up behind the dreadful bounds of many a bar, While as near As the laughter to the tear; Shallow as a limpid brook, Deeper than the Bay of Fundy And the ocean's awful book— Rosa Mundi. THE INVALID. Jane! That was what her parents called her, Heedless of their child's felicity In the bond, which thus enthralled her By the curt and coarse simplicity— Bound to be her future bane. Yet arising With surprising Cleverness above her doom, She transmuted a dull story Of unmitigated gloom, Into quite a crown of glory. Jane! She with subtle female quickness Saw and seized her opportunity, And assumed the part of sickness With its chances and impunity, And the curtained window pane. Nothing sweeter Or discreeter Than this stroke of genius bright, Could have saved her from the stigma Of deserved not slur or slight— Now she was a fair enigma. Jane! None could ever style her Jenny Now and scorn her quiet homeliness, As if hardly worth a penny— She put on a garb of comeliness, Changing hourly like a vane. With her sceptre Still adepter Each new day aloft, alone, She dispensed her laws unfailing Sitting queenlike on a throne, From her couch of measured ailing. Jane! Thus she meted that or this stress, With a swift and sad authority; Parents', servants', doctors', mistress, One against the vast majority— Nursing woes that did not wane. Every morrow Had its sorrow, Or some pain defying cure; Left her yet more firmly planted In an empire broad and sure, Ruling over slaves enchanted. JOAN. I tell you, Joan Was never and will never be as cheap As your great market heap Of marriageable girls, all sorts and sizes— But one of the few prizes; And she is staunch As my pet strawberry roan, From tiny head to shapely haunch: Excuse the simile; Not like that made-up Lady Emily, All rouge and powder—see her puff box! And sniffling like that priest of Bethel, The Baal jumper And mad tub-thumper; I'll take a pinch— Thanks for your snuff-box! You talk of Ethel— Ah, my true Joan is honest every inch, And looks it, walks it in high-stepping paces, With all the usual gifts and graces; Plus that which makes the grand totality (Without the fads that turn most silly) Her bright fresh individuality; And fairly broken now to hand— Yes, running in a silken band— My chestnut filly. Just see her action, mark her head So delicately poised on arching Swan neck and shoulder— All thoroughbred. None of your stupid codes and starching, But freedom, fire, and open ways And (as there is no figure bolder) What I should call sheer “devil”— Force bursting through thin custom stays, In gay ripe revel. You are a scholar, I a mere plain man, sir, Though not a simple Simon; And you would reel me off a sounding chain Of learnèd words, in form of answer, Out of your loaded classic brain, And say she has a “Daimon.” Ah, many a moth Was scorched in her fierce candle And went out into utter Darkness—if with a sputter. She hourly made and broke her solemn troth And liked to dandle One puppet, then another, as a loan Repaid in tears And blighted years— That's Joan. CICELY. Neatly, nicely, little Cicely Radiant with her wild rose-bloom, As if born without a thorn Flits about the social room; Each light action is distraction Done with pure unconscious art, Which in smiling ways beguiling Flutters every foolish heart. Curates flocking round her mocking Playful words discover late, From the woes of secret throes They have met the usual fate. She is tender, soft and slender, But has got a stubborn will; And those feet, however sweet, Tread down all obstruction still. Yet her careful path is prayerful Starting from the early shrine, And her motions at devotions Though unstudied are divine. And so pretty are the jetty Lashes curtaining her eyes, That amaze can hardly gaze Into those deep mysteries. She has prickles fair and stickles Not at seasons in their use, And no thorn is as the scorn Veiled in compliments profuse. But the satire like her attire Is most delicate and dear, For it heals whate'er it steals And has never wrung a tear. But I wonder if a blunder Was by nature wrought in spite, And her face alone is grace With the heart omitted quite. Neatly, nicely, little Cicely Goes her own indifferent way; Now at morn to pleasure born, Then at Evensong to pray. For the beauties of Church duties She has a religious thirst, And is pat in all the matin Services and ever first. But she marks not, and she harks not To adorers at her side; Deaf to love, she laughs above, In her heedless power and pride. A BESOM. With a tongue, with a temper and way That is hardly discretion And a trick of transgression— But not wrought from the commoner clay; She has something of iron, In the purpose that never will mend And moves steadfast and straight to its end, With the face of a Siren. But you cannot help liking her too, And the lovers are legion that woo Those imperious paces, And fresh mutinous graces. Here is one, I confess, of the fools Who are proud to go slaving At her hand's pretty waving, And delight to be toys or her tools. Yes, in spite of her frankness And her fidgets and humours and all, My poor life without her and her call Would be burdensome blankness. I adore her, and kneel at the shrine Which is sweeter because not divine; But I serve at a distance, And with no soft assistance. O she may be a “Besom” and more And her tantrums are awful, Sometimes even unlawful, But she's loyal and honest at core. She seems often quite merry— Though perhaps at the mischief she makes Or the hearts that her petulance breaks, And is brown as a berry. In her passions of course she shows best, And in fig leaves alone would look drest; I have seen her half tipsy With mere life, like a gipsy. I should pity her husband, and yet Though she treads on conventions She has proper intentions, And her thorns are her jewels and set. But we want a good sweeper, In the rot and the rubbish and dust With which customs would perish or rust— She is everyone's keeper, And her victims do not heed the pain, They are ever the last to complain; For she holds us in order, Though for her is no border. HALLELU NELL. “I'm just bustin' wi' glory,” Said our Hallelu Nell, “From a-tellin' the story Of triumphs o'er 'ell. And the Capting and me Had a thunderin' tea, Of good shrimps and salvation, When we pluckt from damnation, A 'ot firebrand young swell. O 'e dropt in like Balaam Orl to cuss and confound us, An' e' went 'ome no stray lamb But a-folded and sure, An' a convert secure. But the Lard were around us, And as blindness could see, Played the Divil wi' 'e. Yes, the Lard gave 'is pepper To that lost one and leper, An' 'is arrer went hin; Till that mighty 'igh stepper Were convicted of sin. So the Capting and me Had the shrimps for our tea— Hallelu! Hallelee!” JEANNE D'ARC. Whitest-souled of women standing 'Twixt the daylight and the dawn, Crowned with glory and commanding Worlds though long from earth withdrawn! We, who mourn the monstrous sentence Passed upon thy service true, Come with free though late repentance Here to pay the honour due. England, as one man, before thee Kneels to crave thy pardon now; Sons of men who slew adore thee, Queen and saint, with haloed brow. Whitest blossom, wondrous maiden, Sphered above us in pure light; Erst with sins and sorrows laden For thy county, as thy right! Surely thou wast thus anointed Then with suffering and its brand To redress the times disjointed, Not for one but every land. If our sires betrayed thee, keeping Counsel but with bloody parts; Let us build thy tomb, with weeping, In the temple of all hearts. IN THE ROUGH. None of your angels, Priest, for me; But ripeness real and human, Voluptuous limbs and graces free— A blood—and—fleshly woman! I am sick of all your pious paint And cheap hysteric purity. The raptures of the writhing saint— A fig for church futurity. Give me the naked bust, and charms Not coy nor yet too clamorous: The hanging breasts and heavy arms, And kisses bold and amorous. What, do you blame me, reverend Priest, With all your paid-for patter? Man is half brother to the beast, And more than three parts matter. He loves his dishes full and hot Not virtues vegetarian. And if he has an angel's lot The angel is Tartarean. So let me rollick, while I may, With woman of like leaven, And make the best of mortal clay— I am nearer earth than Heaven. SALVATION SALLY. I am young Salvation Sally, And I feel no mortal woe In the blackest slum and alley Held against us by the foe. We are marching on to Glory, 'twixt the dying and the dead; But we heed no bar or danger, while the Lord is overhead. Flame and iron, blood and thunder, Are our watchwords as we move Treading earth and evil under— All the master would reprove. To the music of the tambourine and rattle of the drum, We are steeping boldly forward, ever on to Kingdom Come. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, No fine lady bound to faint When the flints fly musically— No love sick rose-water saint. We are fighting for the Captain, and we count no shame or shock; In the hurly-burly dancing, with our feet upon the rock. Though my bread has oft no butter, And we get more blows than pence, I pluck souls from out the gutter And the Lord is my defence, When I wrestle sore with vices in a shade like judgment gloom, Loudly ringing in my ear is the archangel's trump of doom. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, Ripe for any turn or toil Like a slave upon a galley— When redemption is the spoil. What are scars but decorations, what are wounds on breast and hand, If we rescue from the burning only one consuming brand? Others rest on purple pillows But I know the time is short And I brave the tossing billows, Bringing shipwrecks into Port. Yes, I hear the Master's footsteps, now, along the shining shore; I must work while I am able, till I rest for evermore. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, And I laugh at sticks and stones, When about the Ark we rally To the banjo and the bones. We are in the Blessed Army, and we serve alone the Lord; He will keep us in the battle, He is Sun and Shield and Sword. I have offered all and given Of my utmost and the best, To be healed and cleansed and shriven Safe upon the Saviour's breast. Gladly did I part from even my sweetheart and my kith and kin, That I might make Him my Husband and be washed from every sin. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally— Not bad-looking too—but, then, I have left the vicious valley And the wicked baits of men. I am stepping up and higher on the holy mountain tops, Far above your sweet temptations and the gilt of sugared sops. I have found the milk and honey, Goodly pearls and costly spice; Purchased by no bribe of money, But attained through sacrifice. Gaily fasting, in the teeth of oaths and buffets, still I ask Not for wages of the worker, but a double heavier task. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, On the watch for any sin; Be it brothel, be it ballet, Always ready to romp in— Wave the flag and march, where drunkards at their orgies loaf or lurch; Lift the songs of Zion louder than the droning of the Church. Hell and all its demon malice Will not make my paces trip; I will dare, and dash the chalice From the sot's poor trembling lip. O I see a crown before me, and the promise of a palm; And to suffer so for Jesus, is enough reward and balm. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, Fashioned of a sterner stuff Than to dawdle here or dally, For a blow or one rebuff; Shaped and shaken by the hustling of the mob to harder form, Till I take the bruises kindly and can ride upon the storm. What are blows and maledictions, Earth of iron and heaven of brass; If the Lord, in her afflictions, Holds His Hallelujah Lass? I can bear the furnace hotter, I will welcome lash and loss, Just to plant a little farther in the darkness the dear Cross. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner! what of thee? I am young Salvation Sally, And I never may grow old; Now no more I shilly-shally, With the fleshpots and the gold. I have got a secret manna and the treasure of the truth, And the well of living Water will ensure eternal youth. For the Lord is food and clothing, And my sorrows are His kiss; Trouble is His touch, and nothing (While He keeps me) comes amiss. We are marching on to Glory, through the wilderness and flood; Purged for ever from our passions, in the fountain of the Blood. Hallelujah! I am free; Man and sinner, what of thee? MURIEL. When I gaze at Muriel Calmly bright, All hearts' delight, Lo, I walk on asphodel; Flash upon me, as I look, Regions fair Of purple air, Opened like a wonder book. And I seem transported far Out of space, Beyond the trace Of the least-conjectured star. With a wistful glance her eye Turns from ill, While catching still Glimpses of eternity. Never quite at home on earth, She outstands On borderlands Leading from our dusk and dearth. Though one foot is planted here Over death, She draws her breath In another atmosphere. When I speak to Muriel, She if nigh Appears as high As a solemn sentinel; Planted by an angel host, On a tall Fair city's wall, Keeping guard at her great post; And her very words sound faint, Hardly clear To human ear, Like the visions of a saint. Every time she moves, she brings Memories And ecstasies Of pure hopes and happy wings. Golden chords of our lost strain, Murmur on Of music gone, Which will yet come back again. Thus, although I cannot guess What her sight Beholds in light, I can feel her heavenliness. NAOMI. Naomi, dear bud of beauty, Tell me where Love is born for bliss and duty, That my fancy may fly there. Did you come On a prayer or promise gliding And with heaven in your safe hiding, As the angels—earth has some? You know well, What the secret and the sources Of the secret fires and forces; Whisper, and I will not tell. Naomi, your name is sweetness, Naughty strife Must keep far from maiden meetness, Meant as music for our life. Your white part Is, upon the curve of kindness, To pour sunbeams into blindness And to feed the hungry heart. God has made You, to carry His pure message, With its broad and brighter presage For your sisters in the shade. “TOM'S A-COLD!” “Tom's a-cold!” Thus the burden came to me, Doubtful if to stand or flee From the darkness fold-on-fold. Was it some poor child astray, While its teeth went chitter chatter And each foot kept pitter patter, Just like castanets at play? I who fancied I was bold, Trembled at that troubled cry Wrung from pain and misery— “Tom's a-cold!” “Tom's a-cold!” And the words came closer still Down the hollow in the hill, With an agony untold. It was some belated boy, With a frame that shook and shivered And the breath that caught and quivered, Mocking our bright Christmas joy. I in selfishness grown old Heard that anguish beating time, With the blast in winter rime— “Tom's a-cold!” “Tom's a-cold!” Suddenly from that deep night Drew a strange unearthly sight, Something piteous to behold. For a little child stept forth Helplessly, and all a-flutter With the frost and all an utter Nakedness in the grim north. Quite a baby thing, with gold Tresses gleaming stiff and stark From the icy wind and dark— “Tom's a-cold!” “Tom's a-cold!” Up he wavered with his eyes Sad as dead eternities, Dim from their most awful mould. Yet a boy and very fair, Though his teeth went chitter chatter And each foot kept pitter patter, In the horror of the air. But when now within my hold, To be warmed upon my breast, Lo, he vanished in unrest— “Tom's a-cold!” TANSY. Heaven may vanish like a dream Or the glimmer of a stream, And all hell come; But if other forms go by, Thou, pure Immortality, Shalt be well come. Radiant eyes of more than morn Into our dumb darkness born, Love expected; Hail to thee, white wondrous Child, Earthly yet all undefiled, God-protected! Thou dost bloom the brighter yet From the shadows round us set, And art sweeter; These imperfect works, that weave Lesser lives of frailty, leave Thine completer. O shine on, incarnate Bliss, Poised betwixt a smile and kiss, Mercy's prophet; I shall hear thy footsteps pass Soft as dew upon the grass, Down in Tophet. THE SIBYL. The light of long-past ages Lay upon her calm eyes, Which looked the passion pages Of dreadful mysteries; With all the hopes and fears Of all the yearning years, In dead eternities. With dim and distant waking, The yet undreamed-of morn Seemed in her vision breaking, Beyond the gulfs forlorn; The future like a rose White-bosomed did unclose, The bliss of man unborn. By nothing stirred or stricken She saw the waves of time, Like clouds of sunset sicken From their pure golden prime; Till every hue and ray Made music, in the day Of the one perfect chime. Above all grief and gladness She watched the pageants pass, The lights of mirth or madness, Like shadows on the grass; And her great tranquil eyes Reflected earth and skies, As in some heavenly glass. TO MAUDE. Maude, Nature lent thee, Beauty meant thee To be very true and brave, Not a bright and jewelled fraud Blown by every wind and wave Of the Mode, through gilded glooms— Even in ducal drawing-rooms. Surely thou Hast a soul of better stuff Than a mantle or a muff, Or the pearls upon thy brow? Life Is no sonnet, Nor a bonnet Fashioned in the richest way; But it knows the altar knife, And through sorrows learns to pray Is to be in perfect truth And retain perpetual youth. Heaven is thine, Not a thing of utter chance But a due inheritance, And to make this earth Divine. Love In its fulness Lights the dulness, Which were else our petty part; Not the fitting of a glove, Nor the follies of the mart; In the broidered cuff or cape, Soul and all may thus escape. Time is more, Than the passion of an hour Or the flushing of a flower, With eternity in store. Maude, Life is living Just by giving All we are and all we have, With a mind above the gawd That can only deck a grave; Dare to be thyself, and turn From the lights that downward burn. Do the thing That is worthy, to the close; Till it orbs a perfect rose— Though by daily suffering. GLADYS. Gladys, tell me What the secret is of joy, When the shadows that repel me Only are to you a toy; How you find delight in fears Which befel me, And a sweet that cannot cloy In the fountain of soft tears. Cares, my trouble Fain would double, Are to you a source of blessing and the music of the years Or a bubble. Gladys, bid me Share the sunshine of your lot, Out of darkness that has hid me From your brightness with its blot; Let me gather, though your lip Often chid me, Fruits of beauty which may not Now from my dull hearing slip. Love, if blindly And confin'dly, Lifts to you a heart of homage and a hand of fellowship— Treat them kindly. Gladys, take me As I am, an empty thing, To your bosom which will make me Laugh and blossom out and sing; Do not let me drift afar, Nor forsake me In the splendour of your Spring, When the gates of heaven unbar. Faith is flowing, With the blowing Of the flowers that break in lustre, like a sky of many a star Earth-wise growing. Gladys, hold me with the passion of your spell Which has captured long and told me Where the founts of glory dwell; Keep me with your gossamer Chains that fold me, And the charms that fit me well With the choice you still defer. Life is nothing But for lothing, If love house it not and give it (though it be a prisoner) Food and clothing. THE ROWAN TREE. Will she meet me at the high light Of a glaring summer noon, Or some turning in the twilight And a mist-belated moon? Or when dawn is young and tender, with an unarisen splendour, She will surely meet me soon? Others may be false and fickle, And with feigned caresses dear Fondly love to tease and tickle Empty heart and idle ear. But my darling is as loyal, as her nature must be royal And without a fault or fear. Hallowe'en is drawing nearer, And the rowan tree grows red With a promise written clearer As each leaf is lightly shed; And I know that when the shadows fall upon the moor and meadows, I shall see her haloed head. Others may delight to cozen Foolish lives of faithless men, She would come if rolled a dozen Seas betwixt her and my ken; And if I am true and ready, at the tree with footstep steady She will surely meet me then. THE EVERLASTING BOY. The everlasting boy— Young king, upon the edge of Time He stood and let his challenge chime Down ages in his joy. He saw the sunrise in his face, Which was the morning's early grace Yet bore the evening hue; And in the passion of his pride He thrust the thought of death aside, And to himself was true. He looked the herald of our God, And in His might and music trod. The everlasting boy— He only laughed when peril came And fronted it as though a game, The tomb was even his toy. He played with every form of fear, And passed a while to re-appear With insolence Divine; And out of suffering and the shade, However grim, his courage made A dazzling discipline. Heaven over him grew still more sweet, And earth a carpet for his feet. The everlasting boy— He has a thousand shining shapes, And at his richest flower escapes Our grasp with presence coy. No poet yet has duly sung Elusive charms superbly young, Superbly free and wild; Unstable as the ocean wind, With all the ardours of all Ind Summed in a wanton child. But when his glory most is shed, Even as we gaze, the bloom has fled. The everlasting boy— Lord of the ages, bright and lone, He sits upon his mocking throne Which nothing can destroy. We love him much, but often dread The darling terrors of his tread, That heeds no sacred bounds; Unturned by loss, untaught by pain, From broken bars he comes again To customs he confounds. But, as he wayward passes by, Is something of Divinity. DELICIOUS DEATH. On the dim selvage of the dusk, The uttermost gray mist and marge Of an enchanted wood, Which held as in a sacred husk Some dainty and most precious charge, Tempting a maiden stood. One foot was in the shadow set, One trembled in the moonshine's ray Which flickered where it fell; And her great dewy eyes were wet With tears, that veiled the dazzling day Of their unearthly spell. Naked in all her native charms, She beckoned to me with her hands, Which glimmered clear and white; And O the gesture of those arms Was like an awful Queen's commands, Compelling, infinite. And on her half-averted face Crowned with its golden locks of light, My eyes enamoured fed; I owned the glamour of its grace, The softness that was more than sight, The breast a marriage bed. I moved unconscious to the snare Which would have drawn an angel down, And felt her glowing breath; I watched her shoulders shining bare From fading autumn's foliage brown, Nor knew that lovely death. I marked the moulding of her hips, The wave of warm delicious teats Fluctuant to and fro; I longed to set my thirsty lips In passion on those bosom beats, And clasp that heaven below. Ah, though the semblance of a skull Rolled from the flutter of her feet, And settled at my side; Yet, in a rapture deep and dull, I sought that fond forbidden sweet In her voluptuous pride. But, as I murmured Jesus' name And signed the signing of the Cross, The beauty turned to blight; I saw a loathsome thing of shame, A shape of horror, writhe and toss Down to its native night. CHILD GOING TO SLEEP. Men are so wicked, father says—he knows, Who never did or felt a naughty deed And loves them all, from surly Sol the miser To our good Queen. Ah, how the river flows And scatters round it life, and none take heed Though wealthier for its gifts—yet none the wiser. Chitter, chatter, pitter, patter, Through the village street; Laughing, lisping, creeping crisping With its pretty feet. That's me—or rather how I want to live And minister to every one in need, By sowing here a kindness as a seed And there what little comfort I can give Out of my slender store. I see the fetter Of evil binding hand and foot and fast The multitude, that fight and fall at last— And I do long to make the wide world better! True, I am very small and but a child, Who cannot come and go as others may And walk about and work—and only seven; But then, though sinners are so rude and wild, They would not hurt me on my humble way And I might show them too the path to Heaven. How the wind blows! Like a lost baby crying Among the trees and shadows, as it goes And hardly touches earth with just the toes— It must be weary of such ceaseless flying. Hurry, hurry, flurry flurry, Never taking rest; Rustle, rustle, bustle, bustle, With its burdened breast. Yes, I should dearly like to wander free As that among the busy crowds and sing And bear them blessings, though they could not see The giver. Yet I would not ever cry, At least not loud, nor harm a bonnet string Nor set a single hair a bit awry With blustering blast; I would play proper tunes And make all months as pleasant as rose Junes. At morning I would rouse the lazy sleepers With trumpet notes, and when the evening fell I should breathe on them just a quiet spell And rock them out of all their misery— The suffering souls and overwrought, and weepers, And dear tired children's heavy breast and brow— With music of the softest lullaby, Like that sweet silence falling on me now. SACRED SEVEN. “I have four children”—thus I spoke, Heedless of jealousy it woke In one warm bosom—“Nay,” said Maud, The niece that had no little part Of love and housing in my heart, With eyes effulgent from the laud Just laid upon her—“We are five, All bees in one dear honey hive.” I laughed, and with convenient kiss Hushed lips that had not urged amiss; And then continued, “Five we are!” When of a sudden from afar The baby voice of him that died, In music soft as tears replied— “Not so,” dear father, we are six, And I unheard do ever mix With all your joys, though none may see.” So answered I, “Six let it be!” But then the street door opened wide, And stepped a beggar boy inside With rags and hunger and distress Clad in his lonely helplessness; Who, as I gave the broken bread And warming him embraced that head Of suffering, said, “We are seven!” For it was Christ, and Christ was Heaven. MAUDIE. I sometimes sit and wonder why You are so saucy and yet shy, With sunshine of an April sky, Maudie; And whence you get the golden art Which must in magic have a part, Of making yours my captive heart, Maudie. Ah, you would never tell me how The haloed hair on that white brow, That then was light, is shadow now, Maudie; Perchance you do not know the way Yourself of such mysterious play, With which you mingle night and day, Maudie. I often think our lips will meet, A moment's marriage soft and sweet, Just to be mocked by flitting feet, Maudie; And if a kiss rewards my cry, It seems to touch and tremble by— A rose leaf or a butterfly Maudie. I cannot fix you in one mood, Nor learn the secret fire and food Of your enchanted maidenhood, Maudie; You come and go, a glancing flame, But never twice will be the same In nature if you are in name, Maudie. You do not with my children weep Or want repose, and safely keep Your counsels in pretence of sleep, Maudie; Yet somewhere I, who know you hest, Feel there is music in your breast Which love will waken from its rest, Maudie. And when the destined day is born, The leaves that hid the coming morn Will hang a blossom on each thorn, Maudie; While he, who has the proper clue And key to open what is due, Will come and seek nor vainly sue, Maudie. THRICE-BORN. O thrice-bestowed by God, thou precious gift, My daughter, in the flame That sought but could not find a fatal rift, Kept by the Holy Name! At birth committed to my hungry heart, Which flowered as from the dust; To find it had in Heaven so rich a part, With this exceeding trust. And then, while flickered low the lamp of breath Beneath the blast of ill, Forth from the cruel hand of instant death Drawn closer to me still. Sweet Wendeline, thrice-over thus my child, And on an awful track Surrendered to our God, who, as he smil'd, Received thee and brought back! Thine is no humble lot of human fate, But beyond dark and doubt, To step inside the grim eternal gate And pass victorious out. When skill of man was impotent, to save The soul by fire refined; Prayer wrote thy respite, which was by the grave Itself then countersigned. And surely thou wast ever meant to make Brighter the path of thorn, Which all who suffer and have sinned must take, My dearest, thou Thrice-born! For destiny lies on that crownèd head Whereto the shadow clings Though now through radiant sunshine only read, To do no common things. Redeemed from under the dread altar knife, Demanding lamb and dove; Bloom of the epos of my singing life, O thou immortal love. GREEN AND GOLD. Finis Coronat Opus. Green and golden, Maiden, with the magic eyes, Like a picturè of the past Stepping down to us from olden Years and fairy fantasies— Vanished, but recalled at last! Wilt thou listen To a tale repeated oft, Ever ancient, ever new; While the first stars faintly glisten, As in gardens hung aloft Little lamps of diamond dew? “How can winter Hope to wed with verdant May, And the frost embrace the fire?” Ah, and like an icy splinter Falls the answer though in play, If it only whets desire. Yet the snowy Freshness of a northern wind, When the lands are sweltering heat, Better is than all the showy Sunshine with its airs of Ind— It renews the roses' seat. Yea, the foreland Bleak and bitter on its tower Meeting all the blasts that blow, Still protects the timid shoreland; Sheltering the shadowed flower, And the tender life below. Yea, the iron Ribs of rock like hungry arms And without one spot of green, Still in marriage bonds environ Shy and shrinking virgin charms From rude ills, and rise between. Green and golden, Maiden, with the mystic look And a heart my bosom's mate; Is not youth indeed beholden Unto age's story book, In the wise decrees of fate? There is twining For thy weakness in my strength, Which will hold thee surely up; And my clouds shall put on shining From thy dazzling dawn, at length— With the crowning of the cup. WILD FACE. Wild face, beautiful and brown, Haunting me, haunting me, Grey eyes under their dark crown Glancing up and glancing down, Taunting me, taunting me! Art thou woman, art thou witch, Cruel as some bloodhound bitch, Spying me, spying me; For a cerement to stitch, Trying me, trying me? None conjecture what thou art. Saving grace without a heart. Art thou something more than air Mocking me, mocking me, With that wicked face so fair, And those hands that sweetly pair, Locking me, locking me? Art thou, betwixt day and night, Beauty bodied into light Trapping me, trapping me; With a death that is delight Wrapping me, wrapping me? None may hazard what thou art, But a riddle all apart. Bosom never to be tamed. Schooling me, schooling me To a passion that has flamed Fiercely forth and unashamed, Fooling me, fooling me! Brow unformed of blood and flesh, Bright hair woven to a mesh Folding me, folding me, Till I sin and sin afresh— Holding me, holding me! None may gather what thou art, Each has felt the fatal dart! BUBBLE. Bright Bubble! Child, thou art no more Nor ever canst be less, In dew and sunshine dress And touched with glint of golden ore. Dance on And laugh and love and dream Adown the stream As woman babes in Babylon In early gloom and gleam— Till dawn is gone, Rejoice, dear things that may; I am too old to play. Bright Bubble! Maiden child, No shadows fall on thee Save to relent and flee, And leave thee yet all undefiled. No thorn Or cruel fear Hides in the blossom near, To darken thy young morn With venomed doubt, or spear Of bitter scorn. Rejoice, sweet hearts that can; Leave thought to man. ASPASIA. Who shall deny the world had stept Unto a broader purpose bright, And laughed in the eternal light; Or womanless in sorrow wept, Persuaded of a better plan; Or music moved and suffering slept, And wicked love not idly leapt— But for the Queenly Courtesan? Who shall gainsay, that secret springs Now in the night for ever lost And sealed with more than winter frost, Had made us drink of better things; And earth seen more imperial man, Who with lighthearted joy had crost His present bars nor counted cost— But for the Queenly Courtesan? Yet who shall answer, nought is gained By passion and illicit fires, And death that lurks in mad desires; Or prove the living story stained Is wholly evil for its ban, And fatal charms could have been chained For time far other than ordained— But for the Queenly Courtesan? CHIVALRY. Chivalry? It has no meaning, But when every woman can Go whene'er she listeth, leaning On the empire as one man; When her needs are every brother's, And his own and not another's; While ten thousand strong right arms Rise, for wrongs which falsehood smothers— To redress insulted charms; When her honour to the nation Is its jewel and salvation, Shielded from the breath of harms. Chivalry? It is the beating Pulse within the breast of all, Life of life, and not retreating Till the last foundations fall. More than Fate itself and clearer Than the trumpet's call and nearer To the fountain-head of things, This holds woman's welfare dearer Than the majesty of kings. Nor have bulwarks yet been planted, So divine and so enchanted As its heavenly shadowings. Chivalry? It came from heaven With immortal souls, and trod Earth remoulded by its leaven For the dwelling-place of God. Breathing all religion's meetness With a more than human sweetness, Dawned its light upon the lands; Giving men the one completeness Wanted, and fair golden bands. O its joy of revelation Was their spirit's inspiration, And gave courage to their hands. Chivalry? Thou son of Mary, It is walking in Thy track, Though the winds and weathers vary And we suffer wrath and wrack; When each maiden high and lowly Is alike a sister holy, Reverenced in rags or lace, And our hearts that once beat slowly Yield to them the loftiest place; When with purer love and gnosis They receive apotheosis, As their right and God-like grace. PULCHRIORI DETUR. To thee, more a ravishing and fair Than other forms superbly sweet, Unborn as yet, or with a chair For babies meet! I bring this garland for thy hair Which fancy now from far doth greet, And lily bells of price to pair Thy flower-like feet. What matters it that this poor hand Shall never rest and glow in thine, Nor I a willing servant stand Within the shrine? Thy beauty still lights the whole land For me, and maketh nature mine; And all I am, at thy command, Becomes divine. I see thee now, with prophet look Which is no idle gleam or guess, Nor picture from a story book, In white undress. Thy voice is like a babbling brook, A-rippling through a wilderness; Which from it takes, and ever took, Its loveliness. AN INCIDENT. Nut-brown Bridget Woke one dawn with dewy eyes Glistening like the opening skies, In a fever and a fidget. Had not Ethel, Daughter of the Minister Who was want to roar in Bethel, She that played the dulcimer In the chapel, Asked her on that summer day Just to steal with her away And enjoy a little bite (Which would soil no garment white) Of the fair forbidden apple? Birds were calling, Petals falling From the roses pink and red In the garden at the gate, As she crowned her pretty head With a hat as fit as fate. But then surely And demurely, Like a kitten with a mouse, Off she started Summer-hearted From the house; With the glory of her errand Played with, patted, as a boy Makes in class a serious toy Of some unfamiliar gerund. At the corner Ethel clothed in pearly gray, Tall, dark-eyed, dark-haired, and prim With the meekness of a mourner Met her like a muffled hymn, Which has sadly gone astray; So subdued her Sabbath voice, Which yet hardly dared rejoice. Both soon bubbled up with glee, And ran over Like a vessel Filled beyond its fullest measure, As they felt themselves so free, Passing fields of crimson clover Where the rippling wind would wrestle With the blossoms at their feet, And remove the choicest treasure Honeyed by reposing sweet. Then they came To the iron road and carriage Ready with the steed of flame, As if going to their marriage; Laughing, talking, full of light— Till the crash and cruel night. AUGUSTA REDIVIVA. Soaked in depths of day and night, in sleep and laughter, Art thou goddess, art thou child, Woman-born but with no heed of our Hereafter Yet by nothing here beguil'd? When I gaze upon the ripeness of those pouting Rhythmic rose-red old-world lips, Then down ages comes the thunder of the shouting In the Roman great eclipse; And I picture pomp and state-craft with the gory Sands of scenic pride and power, And thy beauty throned by Cæsar in his glory, Bursting into scarlet flower. Other-time, and ancient circumstance and splendour, Round thee with a harder line; Yet those eyes of midnight can be mild and tender, With deliciousness divine. And that mouth that curls to meet me, proud and fearless, Once by Emperors was kist; When they leant upon thy bosom, lustful, tearless, In their robes of amethyst. Like verbena perfumes of the past and stages Tramped by loud prætorian feet, Cling about thee and unclose those grand grim pages, Living, terrible and sweet. Light of dew and bloom of passion, rich and rotten, Yet in dying more than ours; Breathe from thy full fairness of repasts forgotten, And ambrosial breasts and bowers. O Augusta, blood and flame and arms of iron, If thou dost to love consent, Yield their dreadfulness to thee and thus environ Favours when thy limbs relent. But thy milk is wine, thy meekness but the pity Of the gods who cannot spare, Dealing out the destined fate to soul or city In the calmness of their care. Heroes from those loins must issue, lordly natures, Not the starvelings of our days; Minds that give and take no seal or legislatures, Duller than imperial rays. Once thy love was death to little hearts of mortals Who would flutter in thy fires, And the fools that dared thee never left those portals Blasted with their vain desires. For thy cosmic unconcern was vast and awful As the sweep of planets' path, Never asking if thy pleasure might be lawful Or consuming in its wrath. Yet amid thy larger fancies lurked that sportive Spirit of a babe at play, Dropping deaths and lives and passing loves abortive, Tears and laughters, on its way; Infancy divinely deaf for ever making Treasures of unhoarded joys, In unconscious nakedness, and idly breaking Hearts and continents and toys. CIRCE. Out of the red lips laughter, Music and lust and life Careless of the hereafter, Severing man and wife. What if she treads the vintage Ruddy but not with grapes, Moulding in her own mintage Shameful but goodly shapes? Souls are her daily portion, Souls are her precious meat, Darkened by strange distortion Under hèr sanguine seat. Out of the tresses golden Cometh the light of loves Gay with the glamour olden, Softer than breasts of doves. What if she kills with kisses Suitors that go to doom, Deaf to the fate that hisses Down in the brightest bloom? Souls are wherein she revels, Souls are her luscious wine, Turned into forms of devils, Wallowing low as swine. Out of the bosom's whiteness Death and the shadows peep, Woe with its infiniteness Sapping the wells of sleep. What if she asks the money Coined but with idle tears, Giving in turn the honey Mingled with bitter tears? Souls are her toys and treasure, Souls are her daily bread; Pain is her only pleasure, Wrung from the living dead. Out of the rapture roses Drop on the dazzled slave, Heedless how then uncloses Gate of the sunless grave. What if she blinds and blesses All who desire her charms, Slain in the sweet caresses Lavished by loveless arms? Souls are her food and clothing, Souls are the awful price Paid for the dear betrothing— Nor do the souls suffice. TOOTSY. Tootsy, Though a stranger, Stole into my heart of hearts With her open baby arts And white footsy; Sent to guard me mid the danger, Like an angel from a sky Of green light and gramarye. Through a country not in charts Tootsy, Heiress of infinity, Was a free and frolic ranger. Brightly Formed and rounded, Out of purest pink and gold Into something sweet and bold, And so slightly; Never was she once confounded By a question or a glance, In the eager daily dance Of a mischief manifold; Brightly Did she, mocking change and chance, Plunge in deeps as yet unsounded. Tootsy Flashed, and fluttered Like a bird with broken wing Back to its perpetual Spring, With faint footsy. Half her message was not uttered To the others, but I know What she whispered to the snow And the frost and fairy ring. Tootsy Came and went, where roses go— For I found her window shuttered. PETSOME. Petsome— So I called my pretty boy, Who was every mother's son— Aye, each spinster's; Tumbled here and there, like jetsam Or the waters' idle toy, When the tempest work is done. In old minsters, I have seen a cherub face Often with a kindred grace, Carved in stone that brake in laughter From the cunning leaf and flower, Wrinkling, Twinkling, And with almost living power; As though time had no hereafter, And were a perpetual jest Mocking, if not manifest. When he sickened Still he smiled, And the suffering only quickened Mirth that owed no mortal bars; Finding fun without a measure In the pain that was his pleasure, And beguiled Weary ways, that had no morrow But of misery and sorrow— Now he is beyond the stars. DEAREST. Dearest Comes to me, when I am fretting For the children that are lost, In the shadow yet uncrost; Nearest, If the sun of hope is setting, And the angry clouds rise up; Then with baby kisses tost From her mouth's pure crimson cup With soft fingers, She (a presence unforgetting) Loves and lingers. Only Five, but she is calm and clever With a woman's sober ways; And I cannot feel the days Lonely, Now she makes my life for ever Full and innocent and sweet, With the pretty words she prays And the music of her feet As they patter; Hearing, I am tired of never Angel chatter. Others May be warm with deep affection And are winsome too and white, But her girlish bosom quite Mothers Me and all, who need direction In the darkness of our grief; For her faith is infinite, And her touch a pink relief, When it travels O'er the frown, which her detection Soon unravels. Dearest Clings to me though comrades rally Not as comrades ought to do, And her notes of comfort coo Clearest From the visionless gray valley; Then she throws her baby arms Round the breast which troubles woo, And unveils her choicest charms; Through the mourners, Threads her life so musically Our dim corners. ROSES AND RUE. This is the song of the woman, This is the song of the true, Dear and divine, and a human Mingling of roses and rue; Beautiful, passionate, stately, Fronting the storm wind sedately Just as a heaven of blue. Clear as the light of the morning, Soft as the shadow of eve Shut in delights that deceive; Double the heart and adorning, Which when we doubt we believe. This is the song of the sweeting Wrought by the cunning of years, Fashioned of God and the meeting Made with all laughters and tears; Dainty and delicate, moulded Madly of loves and enfolded Deep in misgivings and fears. Twain as the dawning and star-shine Strewn on the waters that toss Up to the foot of a Cross, Glimpsed for a moment in far shine Out of some infinite loss. This is the song of the foremost Tyrant and toy, and a slave Crowned whom we serve and adore most Heedless of gifts and the grave; Lady of light and the blessing Clasped in her fatal caressing, Leaving no remnant to save. Gently she comes and her motion Savours of song and desire, Clothed in a saintly attire Breathing the purest devotion— But in her bosom is fire. This is the song of the woman Hard as the millstone, and dew Grudged in its kindness to no man, Life to the favoured and few; Loyal and fickle and faithless, Though with a destiny deathless Rising her work to renew. Glorious, lovely, and little, Now with our fortunes to spend, Now with a pitiful end Deeming all sacraments brittle Bonds for her passion to rend. STREET BOY. English boy, Let me picture as I see you Sturdy, square and impudent; Dandled not the silken toy Of a mother, who would free you From the rolling in the gutter And the splendid dirt and splutter, Which will shake us Yet and make us Kings of sea and continent. Ragged, soiled and rude, and heeding Little what the weather says Or the solemn parson prays; Sometimes bleeding From the rough-and-tumble strife, Still your loftiest dream of life; Always fit Now for mischief and the danger Unto which you are no stranger, Full of cussedness and grit. Yet we really prize and love you, Though the language that we hear Sounds surprising, And no foreign imp above you Ever scored by early rising, Or possessed such follies dear; Though you are a doubtful joy, English boy. COUNTRY GIRL. English girl, Shy and saucy, rude and ready For the error and the stripe; In a petticoated whirl Here, and there with footstep steady Doing little duties bidden, But for ever though so chidden Romping-ripe! Well, I know those honest eyes Gray and glancing, Or entrancing With a soft and sudden flame As at some detected shame, Like the light of clouded skies; And those kissing lips of scarlet Which Erasmus loved and knew, When he got that honey-dew Leaving his dull record starlit. Yes, beneath the shabby clothes And the shady touch of grime Or the crudeness Sometimes sauced with ugly oaths, Is a rosebud at its prime— Nature in her pretty nudeness; And when floods in anger swirl, Or the fire is seven times hotter And the potter Thrusts in vesels to refine, You come out unscathed, divine, English girl. POLLY. Polly— Never was there such a child Fashioned of her fragile clay, Full of pure and sweetest folly; Seldom serious, Though in all her humours wild Touched with an unearthly ray, And mysterious Glimpses of another land Always just at her command. Trouble Cannot fall upon that face Which refuses to be sad, And would turn the darkness glad (Were it double) With the brightness of its grace; Eager, flashing Freely out because she must Wreak herself in act or die, And obeys no earthly tie Owned by others; Splashing Flakes of splendour on the dust Of these common tasks, that smothers Our dull efforts as they pine. Yet her little scoffs and scorns, Like the thorns Of the holly, Bid no stranger arms entwine Polly. EPITHALAMIUM. Lilies she had— Now give her roses Spread like the raiment wherein she is clad, Scattered beneath her whereon she reposes Gracious and glad; Crimson and white let them rest on her bosom Blent with that blossom, Sweeter because they are there and a part One with each pulse of her passionate heart; Sing to her Lowly and softly, and bring to her Sleep till the dawn when the shadows depart. Blessed is she— Open the sluices Letting in joy from the founts that are free Only to lips rosy-ripe for thy juices, Mystical tree. O she has passed through the dread of the portal Out of this mortal, Into the sacrament deeper than death Mixed with her being and poured as her breath; Give to her Honour, and pray she may live to her Fulness of peace in the riches of faith. OLIVE Olive, kiss me On my aching breast and brow; Sweetest, tell me, did you miss me As I mourned for you till now? I felt hunger Day and night, and every hour, And my life itself grew younger With the passion and its power. Let me know With that pretty mouth above me, You are not a fleeting show— Olive, love me. Olive, call me By those tender names of old. Wherewith you didst erst enthrall me In the scarlet and the gold? Lips and tresses Meant to play no common part, With suggestions of caresses Stealing in the hardest heart. Ah, those hands Which so softly do beset me Move about yet like commands— Olive, pet me. Olive, nearer Wreathe me as a tendriled vine With the arms that give me clearer Glimpses of a fate divine. Fortune never Now shall part our happy lot, Though all winds and ways endeavour And the world against us plot. For a thread Of your yellow hair would find me, And recover from the dead— Olive, bind me. Olive tighter Still around me cling and close, With those dark eyes kindled brighter And the fragrance of the rose. Through the ages You and I, in different forms, Trod together the same stages And resisted the same storms. When the vain Shadow yet in death would fold me, Through the conquered path of pain— Olive, hold me. AT THE ACADEMY. My dear Poppy, I went to the Pictures With Papa, who for once had no gout; Though he uttered some terrible strictures, On the dresses and studies without. Never mind! it was fun, and the clothing After all is a detail to do; But I think, yet my judgment is nothing, They should just have a figleaf or two. Though some artists imagine, that nudity Is the hallmark of loftier strains; And forget that (like colours) their crudity Should be mixed, as said Opie, with brains. I am no connoisseur, my sweet Mignon, And I only can paint my own face; So it's idle to state an opinion, Which were better on ribands or lace. But it struck me, on coming from Paris, That the hues are offensive and stare; Not so much, though, as poor Sissy Harris, With the husband whom too many share. As to seas—well, the blues are outrageous And like nought in the heavens or earth; Perhaps seeing such daubs is contagious, For they gave me “blue devils” for mirth. There were portraits of men doing duty In the stiffest of poses and parts, And some women with all but the beauty Which atones for the absence of hearts. And the “Poodle,” dear darling, was present With the dews of the country and that; Plus his bride (a prim apple-cheeked peasant) Who is forty and ugly and fat. O to think he once loved me and dangled Half a season or more at my side, And was caught by a rustic who angled With the clumsiest sops to his pride. But I really think Algie is serious, For a coronet too one can wait; Though his movements are often mysterious, And my looks a diminishing bait. To return to the theme, it's a question Of the taste and mine may not be true; I prefer the high art of suggestion, Which leaves fancy to follow a clue. Still the “Dancing girl” stood out delicious, By the President—worth all the rest; But the fates at the end proved propitious, And the view of my Algie was best. HETTY. Hetty has dark eyes, Hetty has dark hair; O Hetty's lips are Paradise, And breathe the purest air. Hetty has a way, Hetty has a plan, To drive the sorest grief away And heal the heart of man. Hetty has a tone, Hetty has a will, For Hetty is herself alone Alike in good and ill. Hetty has a song, Hetty has a sigh, Which tune my spirit free and strong When no one else is nigh. Hetty has a tale, Hetty has a truth, Which mingle as the nightingale The magic spells of youth. Hetty has a look, Hetty has a smile, And those that read her fairy book Learn how she can beguile. Hetty has a note, Hetty has a thrill, And is a moonbeam with a mote That makes it brighter still. Hetty has a foot, Hetty has a face, To bid the desert nature shoot And bud with hidden grace. Hetty has a brow, Hetty has a breast, Where angel thoughts in worship bow And white-winged fancies rest. Hetty has a pose, Hetty has a play Which marry starlight and the rose To midnight and the day. Hetty has a touch Hetty has a taste, And I who study Hetty much Yet never saw her haste. Hetty has a calm, Hetty has a love Which bring me alway secret balm And raise my soul above. A YEAR AFTER. Is it true, is it dreaming, my dear? Is it night, is it day? You were with me a blessing, last year— But my pet would not stay; For she felt her wings growing, She found new life flowing And a stronger love called her away. Ah, the buttercup meadow, It is now but a shadow, Where you and I often would play. Is it true, is it dreaming, my dear? Is it night, is it day? Is it winter or summer. my dear? Is it day, is it night? For I hear not those beautiful feet, Making sound more than sight. Were I only a swallow I would swift be and follow, And carry the Spring in my flight. I should meet, where the rose's Bridal bosom uncloses To the honeybee's kiss, my delight. Is it winter or summer, my sweet? Is it day, is it night? RUBY. If I, dear Ruby, were the rose That blushes on thy breast, Then would my life like it unclose In many rays of rest; This earth itself would wax the sweeter And all my rounded work completer, If by that beauty prest; Thy gentle touch would quite compose The tumult of my heart, And every thought that is a thorn Could not but then (in thee reborn) Forget its cruel part. If I, dear Ruby, only lay Rose-like upon thy lips A moment of my weary way Or felt thy finger tips; I know the clouds would fly and scatter And care be but an empty matter, In love's pure white eclipse; Another heaven, another day Would open to these eyes; The hidden truth, the soul of space, Would yield its glory in thy grace From blue infinities. HERAIS. Far, far away in the dim mists of time And stories strange and mute, Heraïs mingles with the river's chime, Low-browed and absolute. Yet now in shade she cometh back to me Out of the gracious gloom, A thing of glory lithe and fair and free, In dark Egyptian bloom. From this old letter I can build her up, With all the East engrained; The half-bared bosom and the lips' red cup, And fingers henna-stained. I mark the heaving of the passioned breast, I scan the scornful pose; Imperious beauty which relents to rest, As sinks a summer rose. I seem to know the curving of that form, Its supple sinuous grace; Foreign and yet familiar, like a storm Of fire in its embrace. I know that mine have met those glowing arms, My life entangled hers And melted in the madness of those charms, To sounds of dulcimers. O all the tempest lurking in her smile, The love akin to hate, Have been in English lands a golden guile And bliss re-incarnate. AN EGYPTIAN BOY. Thou art the same, Egyptian boy, As England's own, A mother's torment and her joy Of price unknown. The rippling laughter or the jest Upon thee lies, As soft as dew on roses' breast Beneath our skies. No playful banter, threatened deed, Do differ now In childhood's crude and daring creed And broken vow. The pouting word, the petulance, The candid truth, Attest in each bright circumstance Our English youth. The merry quips, the careless flaws, The scribbled name Defying grammar and its laws, Are still the same. The love of sport, the hated toil And study's chain, The father whom his sons despoil, Come back again. Ah, those dear eyes are in the grave, That sunny smile, Which saw the sacred lotus wave Upon old Nile. CICELY. Years go by, Cicely; But I cannot solve your riddle Which grows deeper with the days, And the parting of the ways Though we loitered at their middle. Earth and sky, Cicely, And no glory sweet and single— Green of meadow, gray of cloud, Woven to a wonder proud— In your graces meet and mingle. Tell me why, Cicely, You have softly, sadly altered. Am I waning? Have you waxed? Do the lips, that once relaxed, Now forget the tune they faltered? Blossoms fly, Cicely, And the freshness and the fragrance, When the summer time steps on And its ripeness red is gone, Will be unremembered vagrance. Every eye, Cicely, Feels the glamour of your glances; Many a solemn act and end On those careless looks depend, Though to you but passing fancies. Love is shy, Cicely, And the loudest plea and longest, Though it offer bribes of gold And its gifts be manifold. Is not (if you heed) the strongest. Streams run dry, Cicely; And at last the flooded river, Which has wafted on its tide Toys and treasures to your side, Will have nothing to deliver. Ere you cry, Cicely, Fondly for the riches banished; Take the true and honest heart Now before it can depart, Or your charms themselves have vanished. UNA. Daughter of the golden dreams, Whose delights of stars and streams Linked to old forgotten gleams Make a sweet consistory! All romance, it laughs and lies In the glory of those eyes, Like serene eternities And twin moons of mystery; Chivalries that long seemed dead Breathe their beauty round that head, While they waken at their tread Bloom and dew of history. Una, of such gifts untold Which no careless looks behold, One and yet so manifold With a fair infinity; Where the worlds divide and part, With that true and tameless heart Dost thou stand alone, apart, In a white virginity; I could well believe—thy way Seems above our common clay, And thy dawn no earthly day— Thou wert half divinity. Steeped in perfume of the past And a magic vague and vast, Touched by tender lights that last, Thou art of them amorous; All the marvels that have been Making earth more glad and green, Crown thee wonderful and queen With a garland glamorous; And thou hearest yet the song Low and murmurous and strong, Which has rolled our race along Mid the tumult clamorous. Una, ah, I never knew Visions granted to the few, Which thy maiden years renew With a subtle graciousness; Echoes that had ceased to sound Girdle thee with music round, And unclose each solemn bound Like the ocean spaciousness; Thoughts that range for ever far And beyond the last faint star, With their golden gates unbar Thee their dread audaciousness. DOROTHY. Our Dorothy is dead, And yet she cannot truly die; The earth is brighter for her tread, And still throbs with the broken tie. The perfume of her presence Lives on a loving essence, A gospel that shall never lie. O scatter lilies round her Wherein her faith enwound her, For she hath entered into rest; The white flower sleeps, the city weeps, And she is gathered to God's breast. Our Beautiful is glad, That she hath reached the farther shore; Then why should other souls be sad, Because a sister went before? A glory for our guiding Bursts from her Home of hiding, And teaches brothers to adore. But still with us she watches, And if we hear our latches A-tremble in the troubled night, Then passeth by our Dorothy And lets within a gleam of light. Our Dorothy was here But yesterday, and breathed an air That seemed a finer atmosphere, And made our meanest portion fair. She never had her being In this dull world of seeing, Too fallen for angels to repair. Love was her native leaven, And she who dwelt in heaven Hath now at last but entered quite The glory, whence her innocence Had strayed to show the Infinite. And so she liveth yet, A seraph soul that simply came To kindle (though vain suns had set) In every heart a vestal flame; And when the dawn grows crisper And winds essay to whisper, Her spirit speaks in joy the same. She stirs in each pure notion Of delicate devotion, And better thoughts that upward rise; Thus Dorothy, most tenderly, Opens the gates of Paradise. ANGELICA. She is clothed in the beauty of night, She is glad with the splendour of day, And more sweet than the visions of sight Is the happiness winging her way, In the music of notion; She has stolen the stars for her eyes And the darkness was twined in her hair, While the glory of unrisen skies On her forehead proclaims she is fair, As the heart of devotion; And the earth were not finished or meet, Without her and the pulse of her feet. She is blossom of silence and song, And the breath of the fortunate climes To which perfumes of passion belong, And her lips are the rosiest rhymes— Never dreamed by a poet; And the dew of the morning is hers, With the softness of evening and hush 'Twixt the sun and the moon which defers Its delight with a maidenly blush, And departs ere we know it; So we cannot be sure of her spell, But whatever it be it is well. On an untravelled path doth she tread In her virginal vesture and grace, And the aureole haunting her head Sheds a shine on the dreariest place, Like a promise of blessing; Nothing common or little she seeks, But a virtue is hid in her hand, And the sunrise that reddens her cheeks Had no dawn in our lowlier land, And is good beyond guessing; For her soul is an altar in flame, Burning white with the beauty of shame. When I pass to her presence, I feel In a shrine where the shadow is more Than the noontide, and humbly would kneel As a penitent come to adore, Who yet dares not from wonder; And the sense of a separate lot, With a life above earthlier law Haloed round by a charm without spot, Fills my breast till the gateways of awe To their depths cleave asunder; Till I see how Creation was done, And the angel and human are one. PANSY. Pansy went my way Shy as shadows are and lonely, Full of pretty thoughts and only Serious in her play; Earnest-eyed and coy, An unmated joy, Yet with heart of fire ascending Unto heights of hope unending In a deathless day; When the linnet's voice had luted Answer to the thrush that fluted, Pansy passed my way. Pansy looked at me, With a glance of trouble hidden Like a child that had been chidden, But with purpose free; As a spirit night, Fallen from native light, Seek for pity and protection In some earthlier new affection, Which could hardly be; While with throb and hum and quiver Toiled the town's great flowing river, Pansy looked at me. Pansy would not smile, But her heart had in its keeping Tears divine that still were sleeping, And would dream awhile; Yet a sudden glow Brake from founts below, Like a little sunset flushing All the heaven with rosy rushing, In unconscious guile. Though the land was full of laughter, As if time had no hereafter, Pansy would not smile. Pansy did not pass From my breast which she had captured And with every charm enraptured, Like a magic glass; Mirrored in her eyes Other earth and skies Rose a Paradise around me, Which with deeper blue enwound me And a greener grass; When she stole with gracious giving On my love till then not living, Pansy did not pass. EMMELINE. At times the look of other lands Shone in her eyes so far away, For she had heard her Lord's commands And would not if she could delay. How might she linger or be glad With yellow gold or earthly yields, When but a stranger here who had A life laid out in broader fields? She found a daily task to do, Though every hope and thought was there, And felt a pilgrim passing through— For her whole heart dwelt otherwhere. And while her feet on dusty roads Walked with the bowed and burdened throng, And bare her own and alien loads, She heard on high a sweeter song. No work of kindness that she did Was mingled with a petty shame, But only in God's keeping hid And never blotted with a name. The words of comfort that she spake Seemed of her fulness said and sown, But bade some sleeping soul awake, Yet to herself were all unknown. Confronting death she knew no doubt, Like some white angel flitting by, And earth enriched by her gave out The perfume of that piety. A GLIMPSE. 'Twas but a glimpse of golden hair, A little gleam of laughing eyes; But èver since the world is fair, With greener earth and bluer skies. No more; and yet, when ways are rough Or deeper knowledge brings but pain And human hearts are false, enough To guide me through these fashions vain. I only saw her face was sweet With limpid look and haloed head, And music in those rhythmic feet To move the silence of the dead. She never marked me as I stood, Lost in the clamour of the crowd; But still her fleeting maidenhood, Spake to my spirit yet more loud. I knew that we had met before In other worlds, and would again; While she had grace I should adore, And nought but love could thus ordain. Our lives had mingled in one stream, And flowed together to a chime Which was the note of every dream And inner burden of all Time. So now I carry with me still A certain joy, a secret trust, In union with a fellow will, Eternal over death and dust. ENDYMION. The lush green grasses washed his soiled white feet With cooling waves of verdure, as he slept, And kissed his mouth that melted to a smile Of joy and glory; one blue shaft of light Shot through the cave and showed its golden gloom, As shines a good deed through a shadowed life. Tears, but of rapture, glittered on his eyes And graced the darkness of those curtained lashes, Pearl-dropping; and his pillow was the moss, Brown, yellow, red, and softer than the silk Tost idly on the beauty of tall queens Sunk in undress and amorous. He dreamed, A goddess came to him most wonderful And ministrant, as though the moon herself Stept from her purple halls of native night, With starry robes and native loveliness Of straining bosom and bright limbs, and drew Nearer and nearer to his eager arms And blood that beat like fire within his veins; Until she touched him with her tender hands, And all his being gathered to itself Her passion and its warm deliciousness, Unveiled. She offered him a dazzling choice, Empire and realms of majesty and might, Or riches that the world had never given Yet to its votaries, or exceeding love Passing the love of woman; and she laid Her ripe red lips a seal upon his own, And left a blushing rose a-flame. But he Thrust from him wealth and the magnificence Granted with power and sceptred pomp of kings And stately use and circumstance, and pageants Crowned; and aside he put voluptuousness Of married lives and faiths, and full desire Drinking its pleasure. But he asked for youth Perpetual, and the springtide and the spell Laughing and leaping in the pulse of bliss, Which mocks us for a moment and is gone Before we taste those hidden truths unplumbed And mix ourselves with their deep ecstacies. Smiling she seemed to answer, and embraced Once more his ardour with the bursting blossom Of her own breast; she promised him his prayer, Conquest of time and gray infirmities And all the old sad burdens heaped on age Unequal; but she added the delights Known not to any, save the sealed and few. So he slept on and shall for ever sleep, Awake alone to her high communings, Though in the world he liveth yet and loves And with him bears a glorious heart of dreams. CHRISTABEL. Happy maiden, Of the dear and dewy eyes, Coyly veiled, and sweetly swimming Like a chalice over-brimming With its sacred mysteries; Lit and laden, Out of the infinities. If I could but read the pages Of your looks As holy books, I should nearly know as well But would never, never tell All the secret of the ages, Christabel. Maiden, clothèd In the beautiful defence Of a pure and righteous being And a sense beyond mere seeing, High above our false pretence, And betrothèd To the Truth and Innocence; When I gaze at you in wonder, Many a bar Or bound afar, Blue abysses, burst asunder; And I see wherein you dwell With a peace ineffable, And our little world thereunder, Christabel. Maiden, living Not in gloom or squalid street, In a love of larger spaces And a bliss of golden graces, With our toys below your feet; In your giving, All delights and marvels meet. You direct my road and often, When I stray Or lose the way, Bring me by a spirit spell Back from even the fires of hell, Till my hardest hatred soften, Christabel. ROSALIND. A golden song for her— The gorgeous Ind That robes with gossamer My Rosalind, Yet cannot find a gem Of sweetest fire Worthy to kiss the hem Of her attire. And fairest things that die Could not express, Save with a transient lie, Her loveliness; Which gathers from within Its purest part, And claimeth as its kin God's very Heart; While lesser graces come And lightly go As flowers in May, and some Like winter snow. A golden song for her, Wafted by wind Of deathless dulcimer— For Rosalind. AN EASTBOURNE CAMEO. My cameo face— Out of white marble and the moonlight cut, With sad set lips in purpose hidden shut And chiselled grace; O in the turn of that untroubled brow Attuned to mystery, And in those gray and dark deliberate eyes Orbed with no passions that compel us now, The look that lives in dear dead centuries, I gaze on history; And backward roll in fire and mist the gates, Like frozen fates. My classic face— Ah, if that mouth that were a monarch's toy Could speak, its words would be an iron joy For armed embrace! That columned neck with its imperial pose Of rare relenting, Would match the rhythmic movement of Queen's hands Customed to sport with battle's blood-red rose, With gestures all a conqueror's commands And crowned consenting. The feet might sometimes fall, but never fly, Like destiny. My cameo face— As cold and calm as wintry northern skies, And yet with all the possibilities Of tropic space; Thy hate is a hot thunderbolt, to strike Through worlds resistance; And the wide orbit of thy strong great love, In gloom and gleam and death and life alike, Heedless of paths below or powers above, Forestalls the distance. Yet more than summer's richest heat and rest, Inflames thy breast. My classic face— In this poor little squalid day of night, A glimpse of ancient beauty and its might, And prouder place! Thou art the type of a supremer plan, A revelation Of the undying past, a potent charm, Possessor of a secret talisman To kindle thought and steel the drooping arm— One inspiration. I drink of thee, as fashions flutter by Eternity. WINIFRED. Rare and red, Winifred, Winifred, Are those rosebud lips that say Loves and blisses And sweet kisses Are not meant for every day. But the bloom, with scarlet scorn, Hides the thorn— We suspect no spiteful powers; And caresses, Like new dresses, Sometimes pinch when they are ours. Tears are shed, Winifred, Winifred, Often on your careless road Paved with laughter; And thereafter Toil our lives, with weary load. No one ever saw you grave, Though the slave Of your fancy for a while; And the burden Was his guerdon Only, with a mocking smile. Lightly led, Winifred, Winifred, Is your footstep that will stray Into angles Odd and tangles, From the broad and beaten way; Eager for illicit spoil Without toil, Glamour of forbidden grapes, Lessons, needless Learned by heedless Thirst for devious acts and scrapes. O that head, Winifred, Winifred, Posed with such unconscious art, Stirs the fancies Or romances Now of many a foolish heart. Fair and fickle you may be, Not to me; Others fondly talk and try, But your graces' Coy embraces Open to my flattery. WENDELINE. Wendeline has laughing eyes Blue as heaven and only hers, And the soul of music lies In her voice, that ripples over From red lips as red as clover, Soft as spirit dulcimers. No one ever saw her frown, Or imperious and utter Words beyond a gentle flutter, Like the waft of angel wings; Wears her auburn head a crown, Better than the gold of kings. Wendeline is never sad, And she knows the secret clue Which the early maidens had, When sereness was their nature Stamped with joy's own legislature, And the roses hid the rue. Ah, and singing winds her way With a pretty shake and shiver Like the running of a river, And because her gladness must; So my footsteps cannot stray, In the triumph of her trust. Wendeline is still the same, Though o'er others falls a storm, Setting troubled hearts a flame; Then like honey-due her quiet Gives my soul delicious diet, From her white unruffled form. Yea, she seems enthroned on high, Far beyond our spots and splashes And the common fuss and flashes, Which distrub an earthly breast; And the heaven itself comes night, In the rapture of her rest. Wendeline is balm and bliss To my fretful mind and means, And the pureness of her kiss Is a private revelation And the richest inspiration, When my doubt upon her leans. Patiently she leads me on, And without a breath of bustle As the leaflets sigh and rustle, Should a little wind upfly; And where she before has gone, All the world is sweet thereby, YOLANDE. Up from its green and gracious plinth Arose the gentle hyacinth, And made a carpet like the sky; As if in blessing thus it broke, And climbed with its blue altar smoke To God and His eternity. Yolande was by me, young Yolande, The very sweetest and the meetest Of all the maids that are discreetest, Whose every look was a command. And when the belfry counted seven I claspt a fetter round her wrist, As walked we through that mimic heaven— Love-in-a-mist. It nodded lowly on its bed And laughed to feel our loving tread, While forth we wandered, twain and one; The earth had vanished from our gaze, It glimmered out of purple haze And time seemed now for ever done. Yolande was listening to my tale, Yolande the brightest and the lightest Of fairy forms that are the slightest— She listened with red cheek turned pale. The hyacinth in gentlest motion Was by the amorous zephyr kist, As our lips met of mere devotion— Love-in-a-mist. It bowed approval while we went, As through the opening firmament And in the shadow and the shine; For clouds and gleams most softly set The virtue of the violet Beneath our feet, and did entwine. Yolande was with me, fond and fair, Yolande the surest and the purest Of nun-like girls that are demurest— We stept not upon earth, but air. And in the bosom of blue glory Wè only had to look and list Unto our hearts, which told one story— Love-in-a-mist. We heeded not or bloom or plinth, But trod the heavenly hyacinth, As though we voyaged in the stars; The walls of space had sundered quite, And we were in the infinite Outside all petty bounds and bars. Yolande was near me, my Yolande, The coy and clinging soul of singing, Full-blooded, ripe and summer bringing— And nothing more could I demand. Our tie was not an earthly tether, For all the world was amethyst; And thus we walked, and walk together— Love-in-a-mist. OLGA. Tall and twenty, Bright and fair, Kisses on her lips in plenty And red gold her haloed hair; For the winning and the wooing, And the wonder and undoing Of all hearts beyond repair. White and winsome With dark blue Eyes, as fathomless as in some Fairyland a fountain's hue, Where the fancied is the true. Soft and pliant Potter's clay, Yet with purpose more reliant Than the mountain's rocky stay. Earth and spirit meet and marry, And her cheeks just rose-lit carry Promise of diviner day. Cool as withy, But a fire Never seen on mortal stithy, When the passion of desire Grows through flesh and blood attire. Pure and distant As a dream, But to every one assistant In the night without a gleam; Then with daintiest love diffusive, If at other times elusive As the rainbow on a stream. Grandly daring, When the hour Strikes, in charity unsparing With a faith that bursts in flower— And, though weakness, still a power. Strong and tender, With a hand Eager always to surrender, While as ready for command; With the shapeliest neck and shoulder, And if shy yet waxing bolder When the greatest odds withstand. Blessed and blessing, Fair and bright With a figure coy, caressing, Robed in beauty as a right— Heart's desire and world's delight. IRENE. Irene stands Before me (as it seems) in prayer, With parted lips and lifted brows And joy of claspt consenting hands; Which find in hope a happy stayer, To strengthen vows. Within her eyes, That catch the beauty of the morning And breathe the blessing of the light, The shadow of the evening lies; When she shall wear the sweet adorning, Of perfect sight. Irene dwells In other lands and upper spaces, And rounded worlds of radiant dreams; She cannot feel our earthly spells, Because she follows fairer graces And distant gleams. The tidal rush And roar of common cares and questions May never move that gentle heart, Nor wake a single sigh or blush; She owns no pleasure's fond suggestions, And lives apart. Irene's home Is in the suffering lives of others, Not gilded bubbles that we raise; And in the sacred temple dome Of Him who likes to name us brothers, With simple praise. They vainly try To lure from holy service often That soul, which seeks in bliss above Her native land eternity; But then her great eyes dimly soften, In utter love. Irene waits, As one who watches for the calling Of a dear Master who is night; She heeds no storm or bitter straits And stoops not to the world's enthralling, But gazes high. In rapturous rest She sees, beyond our cloudy curtain, Delights that none but angels know; And gathers to her virgin breast All sorrows that, with faith uncertain. Would sink below. MAUDIE. Did the waters tell you, as you passed, All the secrets of their glancing way? Is the magic of the moonbeam glassed, In those eyes, delicious green and gray? Did the woodland's lisp of many leaves Breathe into your brow its pensive air, And below the beauty of its eaves Teach you to forget that you were fair? Did the breadths of rolling moors and mounts Pour their wildness in your dancing feet, And the upward flash of living founts Form those woven words so crystal sweet? Child of Nature and mine inmost heart, Maudie, it is well to watch that face; Which reflects, with its unconscious art, Every gift that is a hidden grace. Ah, each picture of the golden cup Plays about the surface and in sight, As in glory it goes rippling up And runs over into love and light. Thou art comrade of the devious brook Pushing on its path through bell and bine, Blazoned here and there with laughing look Out from mists of moss and depths divine. Thou art closer to the heart of things And dost catch the throbbing and the beat, The sweet laughter and low murmurings Of the eternal childhood at its seat; Thou has learned the riddle of the rose— How it spends its bosom in a blush, And the petals fragrantly unclose Dew and honey in the evening hush; Thou wast one for ever with the spell Dropt by pansies from their wondering eyes, When the foxglove rings its matin bell And they mirror back the opening skies. Whisper to me, Maudie, what the lark Chanteth highest when the heavens are dim And the dawn seems wedded to the dark, Wavering up like an embodied hymn. Let me also with thy wisdom know That soft music of the lower world, Drunk by love that sees the grasses grow As their shoots in shadow are uncurl'd. I am sure that God Himself is near Thee and every pretty way of thine, And the thoughts that only angels hear In thy breast with life and death entwine. ISOBEL. Isobel is fair, Isobel is true. Isobel has serious eyes, Like the gray of English skies Melting into blue. Sober seems her walk and sedate her smile, And her laughter is caught up Deftly as a spilling cup, With unconscious guile. Nowise may she quite all forget the due Paid to womanhood, and charms Yielding not too ready arms— Isobel is true. Isobel is calm, Isobel is kind, And the Sabbath in her voice Rises only to rejoice With a modest mind. Easily she bends in the passing play, But she never can relent Fully, if she does consent To an idle way. But to error vain she is fondly blind, And remembers not the sin Of a neighbour so akin— Isobel is kind. Isobel is pure, Isobel is good, And her very sight the sayer Of a music more than prayer, White as maidenhood. With a careful step and straight on she moves To her predetermined end, Half an angel, all a friend, As each trial proves. When I bare my cross she beside it stood, And the burden that must be Fell on her instead of me— Isobel is good. Isobel is strong, Isobel is true, And the beauty of her creed Only from another's need Takes its heavenly hue. Glad at heart she is, though for ever grave, And the native melody Of a near eternity Formed that willing slave. To a wandering soul she is just the clue, Guiding softly, surely back Unto rest and out of wrack— Isobel is true. LOVE IN IDLENESS. Bright the water-way went down, With a laughing and a lisping Through the reeds that nodded crisping, Past the trouble of the town; Past the leaden smoke and smother, Where to man no man is brother, In the torment of the strain; Past the red kine in the shallow, And the poppies of the plain; By the meadow grass and mallow— There, in white and pink undress, Lay sweet Love-in-Idleness. In a lily cup she lay, 'Tween the shadow and the shiver Of the ripple on the river, Where the sunshine fell in spray; Half in gloom and half in gleaming, Not asleep and yet a-dreaming Of the life of long-ago; And her pretty lips were pouted, As she saw her grace below; Which was picture oft she doubted, Which (as soft as a caress) Was sweet Love-in-idleness. SWEET-LOOKING AND SWEET-LIVING. Sweet-looking walked upon the green hillside, In beauty and the perfectness of powers; And heeded not the harms that would betide Sad sisters, as she gathered only flowers; She decked herself with garlands as a Queen, Careless of kin, while trouble rolled between. Sweet-living, in the valley dark and low, Gazed not above at unconjectured joys; She heard the winds of sorrow round her blow, In bitter blasts, and had no time for toys; She was too burdened with her brother's night, To know the world was wonderful and bright. Sweet-looking drank of pleasure's golden cup, In jewelled ease, and wandered at her will; While praise and honour at her tread rose up, And shielded her from every shade of ill; But yet her heart found nothing but would fleet, Though all the earth was lying at her feet. Sweet-living laboured in the din and dust, And recked not that her lonely lot was rough Or she should banquet richly on a crust, If sick and needy souls might have enough; But in her breast there burned a sacred fire, And opened heaven at her unasked desire. A BROWN STUDY. It was just a delicious arrangement in brown, Every light, every shade I loved best; The bright hair in its breadth looked a glorious crown, And of course she was daintily drest; Her complexion Was all the exacting could ask, And reflexion Not veiled by a simpering mask Shadowed out in the pout and the pose of resolve; And one pendulous hand, Which seemed formed to command, Beat in time and in chime with the thought to evolve. And so brown was her study it clothed her like eve With an atmosphere subtle and sad, And the twilight though past seemed reluctant to leave That dear face with its beauty to add; Was she frowning, At fancies that troubled her brain? Was it Browning, Who brought her enigmas of pain? For a poem was there and was perfect and deep As the seer ever told, And like oracles old Her lips moved with the murmurs of infinite sleep. Sweetly brown were her eyes, softly brown the pure skin, Golden brown the locks nothing could bind, And the curve of the shapely imperious chin On the brownest of fichus reclined; Yes, and russet The mantle that lay like a cloud, And each gusset If seen would with tan have been proud; And the hue of the true nut was tenderly laid On the delicate cheek With no pigment to seek, And did shine in the line of her sinuous braid. O the blush of the apple in autumn was breathed In the curious folds of her gown, And brown shades were her dimples and suns that had wreathed Her young presence had painted it brown; As if nature Had wrought her of freshness and fire, Till her stature Attained to completed desire; In that crucible fashioned of night and the day, As they glimmered and gleamed, In her wonder she dreamed Of the splendour of earth and her virginal way. SILVER AND GOLD. I madly loved a maiden, and beautiful was she With every blessing laden that exquisite may be; For I was simply human and loved her O too well, And she a wondrous woman who drew me with a spell; But vernal laughed her graces and winter left me old, My head had silver traces, her heart was unmixed gold. I offered her my plenty, my acres and my all, Though unto sweet-and-twenty the grandest gifts looked small, When the whole world seemed lying a plaything at her feet And rosy hours a-flying were winged music sweet; For I was so terrestrial and felt the mortal tie, And she the pure celestial who could not ever die. I did her service daily with joy and she knew who, And honoured whims as gaily as faithful man might do; Her road I paved with pleasure and let her rise on me To loftier modes and measure while made more fair and free; But in bright future's dwelling she counted not the past, Which still was all my telling and shadows on me cast. I wooed her long and humbly with every homage due, With open speech and dumbly in ministrations true; I wearied not in kindness, I wanted not in speed, If she would cheer my blindness and satisfy my need; But hers the dewy petal and mine the sere leaf cold, And I was silver metal and she was nought but gold. POPPY. We have many more gracious Or courtly and grand, And their lives are as spacious As queens' who command; To them honour comes surely, They revel securely In the riches or rank that is theirs at their will; And the beauty lies lightly Upon them and brightly, And they tap the sweet sources that give them their fill; But then this is no copy— The original Poppy. Ah, her colour is glorious, Convincing and clear; While her eyes are victorious, And strangers to fear. With a welcome (requited) For all uninvited, She is friendly and fairweather even in storm; Like the breath of the mountains, Like the laugh of the fountains, Moves her presence a glad unconventional form. When the mothers are shoppy, She is ever true Poppy. We have darlings by dozens Delightful to see, And the daintiest cousins With whom we agree. There is Alice and Ethel Who kneels in Great Bethel, And is said to have cooed on the minister's lap; We know Bridget, and Betty Precocious and pretty, And the “Baby” who would be offended at pap; But their heads are too moppy, And unlike my dear Poppy. She is O quite delicious And always the same, Not the least bit suspicious And perfectly tame; If you stroke her but rightly And ever so slightly, She will purr and be pleasant and ask it again; It you go to St. Saviour's, Her model behaviour's Such a sight as the angels themselves would ordain. She is really tip-toppy, The original Poppy. THE CAPTIVE PRINCE. Bright boy, some wicked fairy spell Was surely thrown on thee Some night, when magic slumber fell And bound thy spirit free; While evil sorcery plied its power, And laid a shadow on the flower That should have grown to grace unknown, With all its native deed and dower. And for a season under this Thou art in captive keeping, Nor can a mother's prayer or kiss Yet break that charmèd sleeping. Thou art not, what the Maker meant That splendid frame to show, A rock whereon one might have leant When winds in anger blow; A shelter for a weary life, If suffering came with cruel knife And sowed the years with bitter tears— A haven from stormy strife; An ark to succour in his dread The toiler on the billow, And for some sweet young golden head A more than silken pillow. The spring is frozen at its source When it would outward flow, And scatter light along its course For thirsty lives below. The heavy hand of sickness lies Upon the darkened brow and eyes, And in thy breast gives sore unrest To all the fair eternities. In these thou hast a native part, Among the suns not risen; But though they murmur at thy heart, They cannot break the prison. But someday thou wilt surely wake, To find the shadow set That hid the aureole thou must take, And be my hero yet. Then that enchanted life, which durst Now hardly move, shall breathe and burst Forth into song and sweep along In music all its barriers curst, Till we who nurse our cold desires With empty strains or stitching; Shall kindle thus forgotten fires At thy young brave bewitching. WINIFRED. Elusive maiden, oft I try If love can pierce the mystery Which wraps thee like a curtain, As dim as deep Infinity Whose shine is shade uncertain. What art thou, dearest? Maid or Sphinx, Sweet daughter, with such curious links Built up of silence, mated With sleep and snow and moonlight glow, For some dark purpose fated? And, in those gray unfathomed eyes, The enigma of the ages lies. I sometimes wonder, if thou art Indeed a child of me and part, With airs so shy and mocking And that impenetrable heart Sweet riddle for unlocking. Thou mayest be a creature lent, To sport in pleasures innocent Awhile with me and others; And then someday wilt fly away, To join thy fairy brothers. For always, when I think thee mine The most, deceptions round thee twine. I never, if I plotted hard, Once caught thee truly off thy guard And with the mask divested; Nor found a little door unbarred, With entrance not arrested. And while thou art in slumber set, The mask is deepest on thee yet And sure as arms of iron; Yes, in thy dreams, no treacherous gleams Tell what they do environ. Though fortune serves me well or skill, Between us is the shadow still. Thou livest in another land, While free of this whereon I stand Which holds not thy affection; And, if I touch a human hand, I know not its direction. A veil, a mist, a message lost Reveal a gulf by me uncrost And far untravelled spaces; I cannot spell, who love thee well, The meaning of thy graces. And when the glamour I would grasp, I find but nothing in my clasp. UNFLEDGED. My Birdie, now upon the edge Of larger life, But hugging still the last home ledge Beyond the strife; Ere venturing farther higher on, As other playmates forth have gone Into the years; And trembling on the wider scope Of unimaginable hope, Illumed by tears; Yet dost thou stay each ardent wing, And to the nest and shadow cling But thou art forming for the flight Secure at length, Though facing the rude north or night In virgin strength; Equipt with that which cannot fail, Though it may sometimes err and ail From mingled good, The gentle and most awful power Which is our God's divinest dower— Of maidenhood. Then thou, if sadly, shalt be spared To leave the shelter, when prepared. My nestling, I am sure how fleet Thou wouldest fly Abroad in youth's uncharted sweet Infinity; Nor do I wish to prison long Thy pretty path of love and song, When truly fit: Nay, I would speed thy passage more, To reach a new and vaster shore And gaily flit; But outside flints are fiercely wedged, And still thy bosom is unfledged. O just a little watch and wait The fuller times, Although this refuge be more strait Than distant climes; Thy feathers yet shall fairer grow, And that dear heart of music know A richer tune; Each hour shall gather beauty, till The coldest winter months of ill Are ever June. I would not keep thy presence bright, When ready for another's light. MY LOST CHILD. I had a child, a daughter sweet As sunshine, milk and roses; And ever-new shy poses, Made music of her tinkling feet. She wove her girdling golden charms About my weary bosom, Which seemed to bud and blossom, Beneath the touch of baby arms. And many a midnight black was light With her young face's story, And many a day was glory Read in her features radiant sight. But now, alas, the child has fled, Who was so bright and moving And always fondly proving Fresh little arts of hand or head. She comes no longer to my door, With gentle foolish questions Or innocent suggestions, Nor patters yet about the floor. Nor is the carpet on the stair Turned into Jacob's ladder, And all the world is sadder Without her flashing presence fair. The form abides though strangely dimmed, But she has quite departed— The true and tender-hearted, With that pure forehead halo-rimmed. It answers to no word of mine Or fatherly endearance, Despite the gay appearance— The fingers have forgot to twine. The locks may almost be the same, The white rose-blush complexion; But where the old reflexion, In gray eyes like a sunshine flame? I fancy in that comely shape Some evil imp has entered, Most ugly and self-centered, And let the pretty soul escape. For if some beauties linger yet And grace the goodly building, They seem more like the gilding Upon a life whose sun has set. But, in the bitter times to be, I trust that young affection In richer resurrection, Will at the last return to me. I cannot tell you, where or when My child was darkly banished And like a vision vanished, Out of the kind familiar ken. One moment tightly in my grasp I held her warm and willing, All heart and fluff and frilling— The next, she mocked my wildest clasp. O yes, I compass with my hands The semblance of my dearest, As close as is the nearest— But it is grave or swaddling bands. Perhaps the daughter, to my cares And burden of sore grieving Sent with a soft relieving, Came as an angel unawares. She found my narrow home too small For upward-pointed pinions, And to her own dominions Flew when she heard her sisters call. My heart at night does often thrill, Believing she is present— As ever pure and pleasant— In loving dreams I keep her still. TALLER THAN THE TALLEST. She was taller than the tallest And her face was more than fair, While the gold and sunlight mingled With a life that through her tingled, In the glory of her hair; And she smiled upon the smallest, Like a queen with royal air. For she felt her kin in meanness, And in commonest uncleanness Could perceive the angel hid— As beneath the coffin lid Peeps the whiteness of the rose, Out of deaf and dumb repose— Though the curse of forms forbid. She was sweeter than the sweetest And her mouth a crimson cup, Whereat love the real refiner And of hope the best diviner Might of dew and honey sup; And, in music, did the meetest Words caressingly rise up. It was just the gentle flowing Of her kindness, ever owing Debts of sympathy to all; Which as morning light must fall Upon others and would strike Both the strong and weak alike, With one benediction's call. She was purer than the purest, And her life a stainless chart Lay wide open to the traces Of the best and broadest graces, Which write beauty on the heart; And they led her by the surest Way, that is unknown to art. Nothing more could add or heighten Charms that hourly seemed to brighten, As the blossoms in the day With the pretty beams at play; And no evil left a mark, While no shadow could make dark Modesty that held the sway. She was greater than the greatest, With her brow a vestal throne Showing every shy expression And the tenderest confession Of high charity's true tone; While her carriage was sedatest, And befitted her alone. For beneath the woman's vesture And betrayed in every gesture Was a touch of something more, In the dignity she bore: And she walked among us queenly In a love that lived serenely, As none ever did before. AN ARRANGEMENT IN GREEN. Hazel her eyes with a glimmer of green, Tawny her beautiful hair Breaking like foam from a cincture unseen, Conscious of course it was fair; Soft with a hint of the seaweed's own tint Tangled in shadows and lost, Tumbled by wind that had travelled from Ind Only for that to be tossed; Ruffled as seawaves that leap to the light Dropt by the moonbeams and caught, Rippled and stippled in hues of delight Painted by passion untaught. Pretty her pose in its triumph of green Bursting like buds from their shell, Carried to conquests befitting a queen, Rhythmic in swaying or swell; Breathed by a form that could feature the storm Truly as evening and calm, Bearing a hand with the air of command Rich in its fate-written palm; Showing the lines of a womanly shape Meet for most passionate loves, Reflex of character read in her cape As in her glances and gloves. Perfect her dress with its glamour of green Graded in texture and tone, Glad with the graces of all that has been Pleasant or daintily shone; Sweet as the plumes which the sunset illumes— Fitting so closely and well, But with each charm of the bosom or arm Speaking a different spell; Blent in one harmony not to be told Lightly by masculine lips, Rounded and bounded by beauty and gold Right to her dear finger tips. I to this comely arrangement in green Decked like the springtide in flowers, Rifted by grass and its verdure between, Bent as disfranchised my powers; Sometimes a look the reward or a book Humbly upheld by her side, Sometimes a frown or a whisk of her gown Gathered in haste from the tide; Yes, and when once (though the season was Lent) Fortune erected a screen, All I remembered was raptures and scent Drowned in a glory of green. TO MY HELIOTROPE. One of the light-bearers, one of the true Maidenly might-bearers winning a clue Out of the darkness and out of the starkness Made by misgiving and dreary not-living, Into the open and infinite blue; Happy as hope, Heliotrope! Always, my Wendeline, timidly turning Forth from the gray shadows up to the day, And with thy purity altar-wise burning Climbing the slope, Heliotrope! Others unwomanly cleave to the dust, Not as thou humanly lifting their trust Higher and cherishing charms beyond perishing, Lured by the glimmer of earth that grows dimmer And by its riches that gather of rust; Larger thy scope, Heliotrope! Sunshine within thee compels thee to follow Only the ray of the unsetting day, Leaving the glare of delights that are hollow; Daughter of hope, Heliotrope! THE MOSS ROSE. I found it first, When wandering in a wood Like God's green ocean; In quest of something that would slake my thirst For beauty born of flowers and maidenhood, And deep devotion. A cup it was of gracious pink And perfect pose, In shade uncertain; Whereat no mouth had learned to drink Or rend the curtain, A virgin-sweet moss-rose. I dared to touch The wonder of that stem, And try the chalice; Because its moment love would venture much, Although I marked the thorns that made a hem Around of malice. And I was stabbed by many a spear's Unsparing arms, Which kept it hidden; And wrung from me reluctant tears For joys forbidden, Those shy and sheltered charms. I yearned to taste The kindness of that cup, So dimly folded; The passion of me with its heedless haste, Most beautiful, in my hot heart stood up, Unto it moulded. I saw the reddening of those lips From me withdrawn, Too close and curling; And seemed to hear through that eclipse Bright waters purling, To greet the blushing dawn. Nearer I came, And every thorn in bloom Ere word was spoken, And secret fire from its great heart of flame Which gleamed from all its greenery and gloom, Had gladly broken. And past the coy protecting cold, My eager thirst To love the leaven Rushed on, and gathered in its hold The dews of heaven— Whereon I feasted first. ANGEL WINGS. If I give Him all my pretty things, Heaps of little toys and treasures And these foolish baby pleasures, Will He fasten on the angel wings? For I dream at dark of flying, Though by day it's useless trying And it only ends in crying— But I want so the bright angel wings. If I bring dear Father our gray Poll Or the ball of crimson leather, Might he not allow one feather— If I added too my Christmas doll? Surely for a piece of candy, With the kitten white and sandy And beribboned like a dandy, He would do this—with my Christmas doll? Once I took no sugar in my cup, And was quite two minutes praying Down upon my knees, and saying What nice treats I really could give up; If he would, ere I got older, Not believe me rude or bolder Than was right, and let my shoulder Blossom out—what would I not give up? He loves children, held them in His hand And bestowed on them a blessing Sweeter than the best caressing— But I am not sure He understands; Though He said no jot or tittle Was unseen, we are so little And of texture weak and brittle, That I doubt He always understands. If I knew where angel wings were kept, In what quiet corner hidden, Though I should be sorely chidden I would take the smallest while He slept; And among those many shining Plumes of grace and glory twining, Far beyond all earth's refining— He would never miss them, while He slept. If I offer all that is my own With my brother's who can spare it And will sometimes even share it, Then I might awake and find me flown; And perhaps my tears to smiling Yet may turn from ways of wiling And discover games beguiling, When on wings within me I have flown. SECTION II. Blood and Iron. “TRUST IN GOD AND KEEP YOUR POWDER DRY.” Trust in God, Trust in God In the way your fathers trod, When they gave the foeman point, Blood and steel, Though a world was out of joint— Till at heel; Though against a hostile earth And beneath a frowning sky, In the teeth of doom and dearth; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God, If with justice ye are shod Marching on through shot and shell, Blood and steel, In the fiery jaws of hell— Till at heel; If around you all the lands Like the powers of darkness try All their worst, with armed hands; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God, Though the thrones about you nod; And, while dynasties go down, Blood and steel Cast their shadow on the Crown— Till at heel; Though the peoples foam and fret Or destroy and know not why, And the suns in sorrow set; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry.

Trust in God, Trust in God, Though all crimson be the clod And yet thinner the red line, Blood and steel, And the toils of evil twine— Till at heel; Ye were born the conquering race, And the shadow soon will fly From your proud imperial place; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God, If on rugged ways ye plod; Heaven will yet defend the right, Blood and steel, And preserve you through the night— Till at heel; For ye fight His battles still And He is your one ally, He will pay the cruel bill; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God, Though you often break the sod For your comrades in the fray, Blood and steel, In the dying and decay— Till at heel; Ye must lead the nations on With your freedom's victor cry, Ere old slaveries are gone; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God, If the issues yet are odd And ye sometimes feel the fire, Blood and steel, As ye stumble through dead mire— Till at heel; For ye bear the Holy Ark, And for liberties ye ply All your efforts, though in dark; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God For the fruit within the pod, For the triumph won by pain, Blood and steel, Broken life and bitter chain— Till at heel; Yours the might, the master hand When the prentice work goes by, Yours the habit of command; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. Trust in God, Trust in God With the bayonet or hod, With the trowel or with arms, Blood and steel, When at peace or in alarms— Till at heel; Yours the Book, the living Faith, Wheresoe'er ye build or buy, Not befooled by Glory's wraith; Only keep your powder dry, Powder dry. “DOWN WITH THE PEERS!” If England wants a battle fought and won, She sends a lord and then it's nobly done; Noblesse oblige goes down from sire to son. “Down with the Peers!” (Applause and cheers).

GOD OF OUR FATHERS. God of our fathers, and this land On which Thy mandate falls To do the working of Thy hand, With liberties as walls; May honour be the glory still And bulwark of our State, To buttress us through good and ill, While justice is its gate. O bid our men and women be, Who breathe this larger air, With thy own blessing brave and free And from thy beauty fair. God of our fathers, we have grown To greatness at thy side, From bitter seeds by martyrs sown On every coast and tide; We moulded are by fires of Ind And storm and frozen flood, The passion of the wild sea-wind Makes music in our blood; The boundlessness of rolling space, The majesty of skies, They march with each imperial pace And kindle in our eyes. God of our fathers, we are yet The champions of the right, And earthly suns can never set On those who carry light; We have no purpose but Thy plan Which broadens with the age, And gives to re-arisen man The hope his heritage; We only fight Thy battles, Lord, The one appointed way, And we are nothing but Thy sword To bring the brighter day. God of our fathers, lead us on The pathway we have been, Till the dark weary strife is gone And earth again is green; We are Thy servants, and the tools That shape the shadowed lands, Through scorching flames and iron schools, At length to Thy commands; But when the truth that cannot die Makes all men's living sweet, Let us with the foundations lie As dust beneath Thy feet. A BATTLE SONG. Here's a song for the Nor'land, For the greenfield and foreland, For the wild wind and all; If the old world wax older, March with shoulder to shoulder And with rifle and ball. Here's a song for the redcoat, For the living and dead coat In our woe and our weal; If the bold world wax bolder, Fight with shoulder to shoulder And with bullet and steel. Here's a song for the seaman, For the faithful and free man, In the times out of joint; If the cold world wax colder, Stand with shoulder to shoulder And with parry and point. PRO PATRIA. Englishmen, where'er ye be Always brave and always free, Bearing into heathen night Liberty's transforming light And its charters, writ in martyrs' Blood that sealed the sacred right; Carrying with you as a sword Of enfranchisement the Word, Fighting as your father's trod In the battles of their God; Fooled by factions, can ye be Still a nation brave and free? Englishmen restrained and strong, Foremost against every wrong, Fencing round your path with awe Of a reverend iron law Built as solemn court and column, Without fear and without flaw; Breathing as your life the air Of a justice large and fair, Showered alike on foe and friend, To one predetermined end; Loyal to no duty long, Are ye still restrained and strong? Englishmen, erect and true Dealing to each man his due, Holding honour as a shield Proved on many a flood and field; Who in slaughter shed as water Blood before ye fly or yield, Known on every sea and land By your habit of command, And the proud imperial grace Poured as sunrise on your face; Signing pacts your sons will rue, Are ye still erect and true? Englishmen supreme and sure, Buttressed by a faith secure, Ramparted with walls of fame Never touched by shade of shame, And the story of a glory Down the centuries the same; Earnest, and one people yet With the Book or bayonet, Simple as a child that prays Though with kingly conquering ways; Bought by any trickster's lure, Are ye still supreme and sure? WHAT MAKES ENGLAND? What makes England, marching greatly through all history to be, Terrible and strong and stately in her progress bright and free? Tell me, pages of the ages, where upon heroic stages Beautiful in sun or mists, Stand in glory and the story grandly chronicled and gory Deathless our protagonists; What makes England first of nations crowned by universal will, Leading on the generations to horizons fairer still? Not her bars or breasts of iron, wooden wall or fence of steel, Bulwarks which unmoved environ her when lesser kingdoms reel; Not the bearing and the daring of her energy unsparing Sped across new seas and lands, Onward leaping, ever heaping harvests for the gallant reaping Of her bold imperial hands; Not her redcoats or the seamen shaped and shaken by the storm And the battle, into freemen of the true heroic form. Not the commerce and the Argos blown by every wave and wind, With her pioneers and cargoes from the Occident to Ind; Not the coffers cheap to scoffers till they want the wealth she offers To the countries in their need, Goods and treasure without measure bringing with them peace and pleasure And their civilising seed; Not her merchandise and trading sons, who put a golden girth Round all peoples, yet invading every market of the earth. Not her justice like a banner sheltering the high or low Not her calm and equal manner proved alike by friend and foe; Not the sweetness and the meetness of her infinite completeness For the reason or the right, And the honour laid upon her by the Great who died to don her Majesty and royal right; Not her credit like a jewel beautiful and vast and fair, Shining brightest in the cruel habitations of despair. Not her liberties and charters won on many a field and flood By her heroes and the martyrs sealing them with sacred blood; Not the broader breath of order curbing still the wild marauder In the rugged Afghan pass, And that vision of decision with the sword that in derision Holds the fiercest creed or class; Not the freedom in the faces of her champions, as they press On their outposts into spaces still an unmapped wilderness. What makes England proud and peerless, buttressed by eternal rocks, Resolute and first and fearless, still against a world of shocks? 'Tis the surer step and purer love that builds up life securer Of the women whom she bears, Wives and mothers more than others whom the curse of custom smothers With the chains no Briton wears;— These her safeguards and her splendour, with a faith a fortress dome Under God the one Defender, ramparting her island home. GOD DEFEND THE RIGHT. Where Roman eagle never flew The flag of England flies, The herald of great empires new Beneath yet larger skies; Upon a hundred lands and seas, And over ransomed slaves Who poured to her no idle pleas, The pledge of Freedom waves; Whatever man may well have done We did with dauntless might, So England holds what England won And God defends the right. Where hardly climb the mountain goats, On stormy cape and crag, A refuge to the wanderer floats Our hospitable flag; If alien banners only mock With glory's fleeting wraith, It stands on the eternal rock A fortress of our faith; Wherever steps her gallant son The powers of ill take flight, So England holds what England won And God defends the right. When wrongs cry out for brave redress Our justice does not lag, And as the seal of righteousness Unfurls our stainless flag; The helpless see it proudly shine And hail a sheltering robe, It beacons on the thin red line That girdles round the globe; A pioneer of truth as none Before it scatters light, So England holds what England won And God defends the right. Beneath the shadow of its peace Though riddled to a rag, The down-trod nations gain release Beneath our blood-tried flag; Ours are the battles of the Lord, And never will we yield A foot we measured with the sword— Save for a burial-field; And we will not retreat, while one Stout heart remains to fight; Let England hold what England won, And God defend the right. FOR THE UNION. Stand up for Queen and country, stand For Holy Church and swear To guard the honour of the land, The heritage we bear; Through broadening ages handed down From noble sire to son, The brightest jewel in the crown, And for all nations won; Gained on red field and tossing flood And by the poet's pen, Built up of iron deeds and blood With golden lives of men. Stand up for union and the tie Which married sea and earth, And with the love that cannot die Brought liberty to birth; Our history is one, our fame Flows from a common spring, Our perils ever were the same When swords began to ring; Together have we fronted need To prove our friendship then, And sown the world with precious seed— The golden lives of men. Stand up for justice and the truth Which with its beacon light Gives those that ask eternal youth And buttresses the right; Which metes to each a measure fair And for no favour bends, But universal as the air With our own being blends; Which with the music of its chime Illumes the darkest den, And leaves as charters for all time The golden lives of men. Stand up for empire, and the trust To set the kingdoms free, Because we have the might and must And own our God's decree; That we may carry peace and law Along our blessed way, The shadow of our England's awe, Which brighter is than day; While we prepare with righteous will A higher creed and ken, Who grudge not (if we conquer ill) The golden lives of men. INVICTA. Rode a war-ship strong and stately, on the subject sea; As a master steps sedately through his verdant lea, And at leisure in his pleasure Hears his servants' plea; Over unmapt and unstreeted realms and roads as yet ungreeted, Roofed by heaven's grey dome, Making mid the waters wild as their freeborn chosen child Everywhere her home; Crossing tossing leagues of surf, as about his native turf Sports a country boy, Taking toll of wind and weather yoked with service true together In her iron joy; Castled on the conquered surges fawning at her feet, Broken by the metal scourges to a homage meet; On the bridled bitted brine, seated by a right divine. Terrible and clothed in thunder down the waves she went, Ploughing those green hills asunder, awful, imminent; Black and bearing death, and wearing England's might unspent. In her glory proud and peerless, bent on prey, and fast and fearless Bringing judgment doom; Swung her pennant loose and wide to the tributary tide Gaily in the gloom. Churning, spurning foam and froth flung as flowers on bridal troth, Forth she moved like fate, Threshing on in lonely wrath her inevitable path, Grim, predestinate. Every piston stroke appointed heaved her giant form, Swashed her swirling sides anointed by the crashing storm; Married to the ocean, yet as a slave beneath her set. Rose her bulwarks with the billow in its measured sweep, Calmly as upon a pillow rests a Queen in sleep, With unswerving course preserving Tenure of the deep. Those gaunt throats that in mute hunger gaped, and soon ere day was younger Would o'erfill their maw, Smiled in peace and meek pretence, though with armèd insolence Stern as Sinai's law. Singing, stinging dashed the spray through the halyards and made play On each wrinkled seam, While the dreadful ship in scorn seemed enchanted and upborne In an iron dream. Scooping up the angry water silently she sped, In her lurid lust of slaughter direful as the dead; And the boding skies bent down, gathered to one ghastly frown. Fore and aft they cleared for action, all from truck to keel Fit and in the smallest fraction burnished, stock or steel; Ripe and ready, stout and steady For the battle reel. While, with lightning's livid omen, circling round her now the foemen Drew a ring of fire, Tall and trembling for the fray, as if spirits lost had sway For their damned desire; Hasting, tasting full the bliss of the souls in the Abyss, Gallant ships a score Hurling out their shot and shell fierce from mouths like flaming hell On a cursèd shore. Wood and metal flew in shivers from each armoured hem, And the blood ran down in rivers right from stern to stem; O'er the red dim sanded deck, streamed the price of every wreck. Scuttled half and half now shattered was the hostile fleet, While the Invicta bruised and battered still was death to meet; Lightly rolling, as one strolling Down his village street. Ere a man could say his credo rushed the ruining torpedo Or the ram went home, Blotting out with strangled cry each adventurous enemy Like some finished tome. Swearing, tearing screeched the bolt with a rending and revolt On its settled prey, And with dirges dark leapt out bane from every snorting snout In that smother grey; As they belched and spat and sputtered fate and fury round, And with tempest music fluttered wretches not yet drowned; Each blank nozzle reaped its own, in the harvest it had sown. There in blighted bulks and blasted heaps her victims lay, All dismantled and dismasted round the boar at bay, While like vernal floods infernal Hail did never stay; Shrieking shrapnel and the growling guns and hubbub of the howling Wind that chanted still, Made a tumult like the fall of an universe and all Pandemonium's will. Ashes, flashes, light and cloud, wove the shadow of a shroud On that solemn stage, As she mingled earth and sky in one utter agony With her iron rage. Bursting boiler, crimson scupper wrote with funeral pen, And the sharks had sanguine supper on the meat of men; Ah, with blood of mangled flesh, billows salt waxed sweet and fresh. Yet with colours fair and flying the Invicta rode Fierce among the dead and dying in her sad abode, While in acres seething breakers Beat a burial ode. Adversaries scathed and scattered and with leaden splashes spattered Grovelled at her side, As she breasted wind and wave and of ocean dug a grave In her passion's pride. Riddled, fiddled on by doom floundered through the glare and gloom Bloated bulks of ships, Mutilated now and smashed helplessly as eggshells, lashed By her murderous lips; All the fiends appeared in surly tumult to have flocked, Mixed in maddening hurly burly nevermore unlocked; And the shouts of hopes and fears, sounded as from distant years. Engines of destruction stuttered messages of woes, Hurtling on the heavy-shuttered and enshielded foes, And the rattle of the battle Brake through earthquake throes. Crippled tools that scarce would stammer hate, machines that yet did hammer Wrack and rapine's roar, Mingled as if sworn and set Babel had with Bedlam met In that curtain hoar. Crashing, mashing metal ribs easily as baby cribs Poured the shell and shot, Splintering and peeling fast all that faced the mortal blast Hissing-ripe and hot. Butting down and blindly blurring every new advance, While her funnels still kept purring to the devil's dance, Lone, with lightning sheathed and shod, the great ship in triumph trod. In a threatening sky of scarlet set the ghostly sun, And beneath a curtain starlit by the stabbing gun Ever pounding and confounding More that chaos dun, Shapes like shadows crossed with motion sinister and in devotion Terrible and true, Worked the many-mouthing ire in the furnace of the fire, Though their lives were due; Gliding, guiding with a thin thread of glory dusk and din, As they looked and leant Forth into that turmoil wild so defiling and defil'd And for evil meant; Scribbled here, it seemed, and spotted on the canvas red, Each one at his post alloted kept his gory bed; If with tortured gesture, some fought the sentence that would come. Suddenly the hostile clamour died away and bowed Hardly to the vengeful glamour of that shining shroud, Where with riving shocks and striving Flashed the thunder cloud. Figures grimed and pinched and pallid for a moment rose and rallied Through the reek and smoke, Struggled with despairing cry in their dreadful destiny And unbending broke; Haggard, laggard faces dim thrust athwart confusion grim Gasped with stertorous breath, And with writhing reckless hands cast their curses and demands At that iron death. Till at last, when all were scattered by her conquering storm, Cheering, flag on high if tattered, sank the fateful form— When no foe remained to kill—to the end Invicta still. A NATIONAL HYMN. O God, our shelter and our shield, Beneath the burning dome Of tropic skies, on flood and field, And everywhere our home! Bless Thou the Queen Thy goodness gave, And guard the country's power O'er rocky coast and surging wave— The world that is its dower. Thine are our charters true and tried, The liberties and creeds For which our fathers lived and died, Old England's title deeds. Be Thou the fortress of our faith That it may brighter bloom, Above the passing petty wraith, Of glory and its doom. And may our Church for ever stand A witness to Thy name, The bulwark of this ancient land, The buttress of its fame. Our Empire's sun can never set If thou remain our pride, The Bible and the bayonet Fight onward side by side. Bless Thou the State, and order still Its rulers' high intent, That they may work Thy righteous will In goodly government. And thus may freedom be our crown In every age and clime, And honour yet send its renown A beacon through all time. Let justice in our pathway shine And gild the darkest dearth, And clothe with thunder the red line That girdles round the earth. Make Thou the Queen a corner stone For Thy own Temple meet, And frame her universal throne The footstool of Thy feet. And only where Thy light has led May she hear duty's calls, And by our love be ramparted More than by ironclad walls. And bless her with Thy wisdom true Which lesser teachings feign, That she may render each his due And for her people reign. THE PEOPLE OF THE BOOK. We are the people of the Book, The chosen of the Lord, We but to Him for guidance look And are His conquering sword. We are the one imperial race, We have the ruling hand, Our freedom grants the foremost place And lightens every land. For we were made to govern earth On many a field and flood, To give the world a grander birth Baptized with iron and blood. And we were meant to fashion all, We have the fairest right— The heart that leaps at duty's call, The mandate that is might. The blue sea is our royal robe, On every shore we stand, And carry with us round the globe, The custom of command. Our navies bear the lamp of law, The blessings that environ Our realm with justice and its awe, Secured by blood and iron. We are the people of the Book, The chosen of the Lord, And never will old England brook Resistance to His sword. We plough in hope the barren space, We plant the gospel yet, And if the heathen know not Grace We give the bayonet. The world is our imperial road, We ride upon the flood, We lift ourselves the nations' load And build of iron and blood. A FIGHTING SONG. Straighter yet! Close up! If this evening we sup With the conquerors, as is our wont; Or are feasting instead, With the glorious dead And our fathers who went to the Front. Stiffen still the red rank On the rear and the flank, As if England all stood in each station; With the bullet and point, Smash their line out of joint— Give them hell and cold steel and damnation! We've a battle to fight For our country and right, And they have but a battle to lose; For we only go in As the soldiers who win, And the beaten must pay and not choose. If we get in a rut, The reserve is the butt, And our blows are as stalwart as steady; If you want to know why, It's the powder kept dry, With the cause and the men who are ready. UP WITH THE BAYONET. Up with the bayonet, down with the pen! Bullets are flying, Heroes are dying; War is the school for the making of men. Who will be master? Doom and disaster Fashion the spirit, victorious then. Stiffen the line with a backbone of steel, Bind in one tether Grimly together Purpose and powder, till enemies reel. Comrades keep falling Round us, and calling Loud for revenge and our conquering heel. Down with the tape-measure, up with the sword! England is striving, Red with the riving Blades all unsheathed in the name of the Lord. Wounds of our brothers, Weeping from mothers Widowed unite in an adamant cord. Who thinks of turning his back against odds Cruel and crushing, Here in the rushing Rage of the battle and cause that is God's? We are His pointed Spears and anointed Tools, and His judgement's imperial rods? Up with the rifle, and down with the spade! Digging is over, Fields like the clover Blossom in blood and a funeral shade. Life waxes cheaper Now, and the reaper Comes with the sickle—the harvest is made. Honour compels us, and glory is dear Bringing us laurels Bright, out of quarrels Fought for the Right without resting or fear. Ours is a station Strong like the nation Nerved as one man, when the triumph is near. Down with the goosequill, and up with the game Gallant and bitter Sport, and yet fitter Food for a people whose hearts are in flame! Give us the slaughter Flowing like water, But not a cowardly quiet and shame. MARCHING ORDERS. We were off the Lord knew whither And the Lord alone knew why, As if spite had sped us thither Under some infernal sky; And as Dick said to McTavit, “Multa tulit et sudavit Puer,” thanks to destiny— Always dealing toil and trouble To our boys, with measure double, And in close vicinity! But the Hill men's ugly legion Had been harrying the region Which we watered with our blood, And the losses made our bosses With their precedents and glosses Talk of turning back the flood. And a scientific frontier For which all red tapists pine, Was the dream of Lord Dupontier— Just to rectify the line! For we had our marching orders, And had gaily tumbled out From our camp, to cross the Borders And to worry things about. For the Viceroy at head quarters Was a very fiend for fuss, With his marketable daughters Who all favoured the old cuss; And possessed of one idea As a patent panacea Which he ventilated thus; With his passion for defining Bounds, that needed re-assigning— While the burden fell on us! By a rough and wrong provision He had reached the right decision We were spoiling for hard blows, And worked better if the fetter Of our drilling to the letter Once relaxed its dreary shows; And when raiders lit the candle Which he so desired to prove, They afforded a fit handle To a fine strategic move. For we had our marching orders Though misgivings bothered some, Where to cut the blooming Borders On our route to Kingdom Come. Things looked lively, boot and saddle Were the business of the day, Though the boys had long to paddle Up a steep and dusty way; With machine-like swing and tramping And the horses' eager stamping, As they sniffed afar the fray; And the harness with its jingle Made our torpid senses tingle, And resent the least delay. We seemed sportsmen after partridge, Though not loaded with blank cartridge And without superfluous weight; For the jesting was unresting, And it carried no suggesting Of a sterner fun and freight. But a rifle now would rattle And a sabre then would glint, While the vulture scented battle And the jackal knew its print. For we had our marching orders And were glad enough to go, If before we cleared the Borders There was hell to hammer through. Here an old campaigner's bottle Peeped from its concealing mesh, There a gun with iron throttle Rubbed its nose on harder flesh; And the youngsters, full of fighting To the muzzle with delighting, Were demanding foes to thresh; And the old and stirring story, Waxing every day more gory Now was trotted out afresh. What were heat and thirst and thunder, If the baking earth was under And not over flagging feet? Yes, rude faces caught new graces And in spite of endless paces, With an enemy to meet; For that took from toil the bitter And made hours of anguish fly, While it lent a gallant glitter To the keen expectant eye. For we had our marching orders And were mad, each mother's son, To be first across the Borders, With good service to be done. Then the scouts came in with tidings Drawing tenser every arm, As we (not without self-chidings) Rose responsive to the charm; From the forehead slipt the shadow Like a cloud that leaves the meadow, At the thought of hostile harm; While the stooping shoulder heightened And the gaze of langour lightened, With the music of alarm. If the wind blew south or norward, Yet it bare us ever forward To the feasting of the strife; And wild fancies gave us chances Of renown and all romances, Which alone were leaping life. So our belts were buckled tighter, At the prospect of a game, And the dullest brow turned brighter When it caught the battle flame. For we had our marching orders And retreat was deadly sin, We would soon be past the Borders And were ready to romp in. IN ACTION. Into action we went laughing there and then Full of fighting, full of cursing Which we had so long been nursing, Just a thousand strong all told and proper men. Balls were humming, cannon strumming; And true hearts to battle drumming; As we marched to meet them in the slaughter pen, While a hell of iron nozzles howled Amen. Salt and seasoned lads were we Eager only to unmask that armèd puzzle, Ripe for mischief and the worst damnation spree, Loaded likewise to the muzzle. Out of action we came hungry at the last Full of cursing, full of fighting And hard blows that were delighting, Not a hundred strong all told by muster past; Though as lumber, beyond number Slept their deep unwaking slumber Enemies, who would not break to-morrow's fast— While of us not one escaped the leaden blast. Weary frames and sternly tried We had faced the fire and buffets late and early, But if worn and torn remained unsatisfied— Ready for the hurly-burly. But in action we were like one moving wall, Linked and living steel that harried Ruined ranks and grimly carried In its conquering progress man and steel and all, Down and under, with the thunder And the bolts that burst asunder Square and squadron toppled in the same red fall— Battered, shattered out of hope of their recall. For we never dreamed of flight, And each hand however rude that took the shilling Yet was clothed in awful armour of the Right, And for either fortune willing. But we did return in triumph with the tread Of Deliverers, fit for action Still, with here and there a fraction Left of butchered limb and trunk and mangled head; Having written on the smitten Foes our law of justice, bitten Sharply by the sword in dying breasts and dead, And for liberty a path of glory spread. For the Empire was our care, Laid upon us with the charge that makes man bolder; And its honour each of us upbare, Bravely, on his single shoulder. AN OBJECT LESSON. “Hang it,” said the General, “it haunted, Sir, and plagued my blessed life for years With a waking nightmare, though I vaunted I was not by man or spectre daunted, And as free as any one from fears; Even now when shadows lay Ghostly hands on dying day, Sometimes yet the horror re-appears With curst features like no creature's Driving all my peace away; And I see, arising from the dead, That old vision of the bloody head.” “Well,” proceeded he, “I had a crony In the Guards, a twentieth cousin too Big of heart and frame, a match for Bony In strategic plans, a stout Malony And engaged to Lady— God knows who! Just the counterpart of me, Brothers could not more agree; And a devil quite to dare or do Feast or scrimmage, to the image Of some mad Corroboree. Side by side we daily romped and wrought Mirth or mischief, and together fought. “Then came Arabi, and we discarded, Loo for Waterloo or work like that; And the Fellahs had to be belarded With their own sweet gravy, and bombarded To submission and an old cocked hat; And we two were drafted out Gaily, and despite the gout, On this cure for our superfluous fat; And each other blooming bother We had shared, with every clout. Till at length dark Tel-el-Kebir came, And the midnight march and wall of flame. “Tim was heaping curses like a glutton's On our Wolseley, who let Gordon die— Just to maunder of his private muttons, Or economise in straps and buttons— Glossing all with the official lie; Both of us were leading then Gladly on our eager men, Bound by courage in one living tie. We were waiting, for the baiting Of the badger, in his iron den; And we drew him finely forth, though some Soon passed in their checks to Kingdom Come. “Many a gallant comrade then was stricken Down and lost the number of his mess, Or got there the curse that made him sicken— Aye, and now it bids my pulses quicken, Just to tell once more that stormy stress; When we chased the vermin fast From their hiding holes aghast, Leaving vultures damage to assess. Red as clover, when was over Night, the reaping of that passion past; Friend and foe lay jostled stiff and stark, Equal now and sealed with one pale mark. “Tim was foremost, in that pack of parrots Shrieking oaths and hatred and blue funk, Laughing, thrusting, saving lives like Marrot's And (he shouted fiercly), ‘Slicing carrots,’ Sober yet demented as if drunk; Cheering, guiding on his best With the jabbing sword and jest Men inspired with no less hardy spunk. Till a volley, in his folly Spat its last nor spared that hero breast; And one ball, mid that dire damnèd rain, Shore the body and the head atwain.” Now the General just paused and lighted Sadly a cheroot and smoked, and sware Thoughtfully with zest, as if that righted Nerve and balance for a bit benighted, Or relieved him of a crushing care; And continued—“Then the clock Brought the shadow and the shock Round again of what that fight we bare; And the minute, we were in it, Struck my heart as with a judgment knock; While we dined and drank, one silent spell, To the friends who in that battle fell. “Lo!”—and here his words grew calm and colder And he wiped his forehead of the sweat, Looking for the time a decade older With a furtive glance across his shoulder And a movement half a thrust or threat— “Suddenly, unlike the dead Rose and rolled a bloody head Down the board where we survivors met; Grim and gory, with their story In his eyes that turned upon us read; Big with fun and headlong fury still, Ready yet to strike once more and kill. “Thrice”—he added, and his brow maligned him When he mumbled the old fear had fled And it was but gout that so inclined him, As he cast a cautious peep behind him— “Thrice that ghastly face which grinned and bled, Unawares upon us burst Like an unlaid thing accurst— All the horror of that Bloody Head; Down the table rolled unstable, Daring us to do what no man durst; When we would recall our grievous blanks, And the comrades fallen from the ranks. So we stocked (what you would call) the bursary Next year with each dainty we could store, Catching too a Bishop on a cursory Tour and booked him for the anniversary Which we meant to honour as before. And his blessing proved too long Or the piety too strong For our Tim, and he appeared no more. Benediction our affliction Cured, and the Right Reverend gave a comic song; For, though Tim was first at danger's side, Prayer was what he never could abide.” A BLOOMING ADMIRAL. Old Conningtower was seasoned salt, By many a breeze and ruder pal And kinsmen now in their cold vault, Into a blooming Admiral; For bulldog-like he kept his troth, And liked a good mouth-filling oath Red-hot and neatly rounded; He loved a glass and pretty lass, And was by nought confounded. The breath, as wine, of tossing brine Gave him its breadth and motion— With duty and devotion. A ship-shape customer was he At every fight or festival, Wrought by the music of the sea Into a blooming Admiral. He had a tender ear for wrongs, And hands like hammers and the tongs That struck and did not fumble; And manly strife to him was life, However rough and tumble. He held by Church, even when his lurch Was not exactly steady; But he was always ready. He tussled hard with every foe, Assisting at their funeral And saw them safely down below— As should a blooming Admiral; While he, though pounded ill and oft, Still only higher went aloft And got more way for steerage, Or shook out sail for fresh avail, Till anchored in the Peerage. He handled craft well fore and aft But hated cries of faction, And blessed the call to action. His purse was open to each friend, He brooked no insult to a gal; The manners it were hard to mend, In such a blooming Admiral. He feared no enemy or blast And nailed his colours to the mast, When comrades tried to scuttle; And his an eye for history, Like stout old Captain Cuttle. And when, in short, he entered Port A hulk not now so limber, He smelled of tar and timber. SONG OF THE FLAG. Heads all uncover, Gentlemen, stand; Peasant or peer, but yet loyal and lover Of the old land! Bow to the Country and bow to the Queen, Bow to the symbol of all that has been Lovely and living, And is yet giving Peace to the world with its terrible sheen. Lo, it is waving on coast and on crag Far, and the might of its shadow is light— Honour the Flag. Hands all uplifted, Gentlemen, swear Still the old Colours though storm-tossed and rifted Bravely to bear! Rampart the Church and the State as ye must Strongly and truly, remember the trust Carried down ages' Beautiful stages, Handed to you to keep sacred from rust. Courage may falter and confidence lag, But should the price be supreme sacrifice Honour the Flag. Hearts all united, Gentlemen, weld Spirit and act in one troth ever-plighted, Purposed of eld! Rally around the one beacon of fires Kindled long back at the fountain of sires' Valorous doings, Virtuous wooings Robed in the thunder and God-like desires. Onward it goes, sometimes rent to a rag, Emblem of Right if through bloodshed and might— Honour the Flag. HOW WE STORMED THE BATTERY AND REGAINED THE GUNS. (TO ALL WHO WEAR AND LOVE THE RED TUNIC.) It was Tommy and I, and we took it And a precious warm place; But we deemed it disgrace Guns were captured, and we could not brook it— No such damnable wrongs! We saluted the Colonel, and lightly, Sallied out, with our belts buckled tightly, Trim for hammer and tongs. We desired a good thing and a racket And a row with some dust on the jacket, With the pudding served hot And a tumble and tussle, For the best bone and muscle— And my comrades, you bet, this we got. For, you see, we had merely done nothing, We were sick of just putting on clothing And then putting it off, Though it looked deucèd smart, And the waiting till seasons grew riper; Should the enemy scoff, At our lacking of heart? We were ready, and would pay the piper, And were spoiling for fun and the fray— So away! We had plenty of redcoats to follow, Of the hardiest kind— Not one laggard behind, Who could beat thrice their company hollow And were hungry to go; Just the safe sort for fighting or revels Tough and true, stiff as steel and dare-devils, Saucy hands at a blow. We had more for the work than we needed, It was hard for such grit to be weeded When brave fellows were fain, With a chance for some glory And pro patria mori— To be silent of commoner gain. When we peeled our superfluous matter, Not a sound of cheap frivolous chatter; We gave messages too And our treasures in trust, For dear kinsfolks and friends and the ladies; We had business to do, And as Englishmen must— If their road is as dark as to Hades. It was honour, though death, not defeat Or retreat. I must own my remembrance is hazy, As to each small event; We were jolly content To advance, if the foes thought us crazy— And they holding our guns! We would strike at their blooming battalions, And knock over some scores of rapscallions— Mischief take him who runs! We felt shamed by that infamous capture, And were burning with hope and the rapture Of regaining the loss; Though this poor Adam's image, In the scramble and scrimmage Shed a bit of its beauty and gloss. I confess I did think of my mother With a catch in the throat, and another Who was worthy a sob; Though she shied after all, Like a foolish and unbroken filly, And then married “White Bob!” Bolting, Sir, at a ball; He was richer, no doubt, but half silly. And it lighted me forth, and afar— Dick's cigar. I recall my dead chum, who was smoking An uncommon nice weed, As he wished us God speed! And we parted at length with grave joking, I and grim sober Dick. He was touched with the fever and achey, And though eager enough far too shakey; But he was rather sick, Just to miss what he wanted, adventures, And to write with red sword their indentures On a nigger or two; At the point and the parry, He could fence with old Harry And the winner would be—I know who. But the grip of his honest brown fingers, Were a part of the pleasure that lingers— They seem warming me now; And his earnest gray eyes Looked in mine with a gaze past expression From a puckering brow, As in sorry surmise— But he did not waste words of profession. And that perfume had carried me well, Into hell. 'Twas an hour ere the dawn when we started And yet blacker than pitch, With a thundering ditch To be crossed—but we all were whole-hearted, And quite equal to that— Yes, as strong as they make them, a dozen— We would conquer them somehow, or cozen The defenders thereat. And prepared for the roughest of shindies That had ever been known in the Indies, We crept quietly on Through the murk and the mazes, While our blood leapt like blazes For the terrible calm to be gone. Thank the Lord, by good luck we got over, But to find ourselves still not in clover, Slogging hard, give and take, Bayonet and the ball; Though for them we were just a bit early, They were now wide awake And as bitter as gall, When we closed in the mad hurly-burly. And I prayed, the first time, nothing loath— With an oath. We were death on those guns, sir, and willing For the ugliest strife— No one recked about life, It was only the wild lust of killing; Not a quaver had room, We were loaded right up to the muzzle And to get in more shot were a puzzle, While our meaning was doom. I got grazed once or twice, but felt little, And I knew nigger's bones were but brittle As I taught them to spin; It was like cutting carrots, And they screeched as their parrots When my sword in the gravy slipt in. So we drove the scared sheep in a huddle, Ankle deep now in many a puddle Which looked ghastly and red, In the dull morning light; Till they made their last desperate rally, And behind on my head Fell a blow, and rushed night. But sheer cusseduess won in that sally, And my skull always was (though so scarr'd) Jolly hard. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN!—1897. England hails thee With a thousand thousand voices, Walling round the world in love; Nothing fails thee Of our homage which rejoices, We can reverence thee above. Lo, the passion of one plaudit Like the trump of the last Audit. Leaps obedient to thy hand; Crowning sweetly Yet again, and crowning meetly Our First Lady of the Land. England holds thee Very dear as wife and mother, Walking like great Queens of Eld; Honour folds thee, As it never did another Though by fondest flattery swelled. Thine the glory to have journeyed Long with us and by us tourneyed, But with never stain or brand; Gently bearing Our worst griefs and gladly sharing, Spotless Lady of the Land. England owns thee As her righteous ruler proudly, Who hast lived the longest reign; Love enthrones thee In our hearts and praises loudly, With a pleasure none do feign. See, from farthest moor and mountain Flows the tribute as a fountain, Come the gifts with common band; Thus conspiring To acclaim with truth untiring Thee, our Lady of the Land. England takes thee Now unto her bosom nearer, Ramparting thee strongly round; England makes thee Many times our Queen and dearer, In her loyalty's new bound. Yet once more art thou anointed With our prayers, and re-appointed To a realm by justice planned; Thou through ages Shalt adorn our brightest pages, Chosen Lady of the Land. GOD OF BATTLES. O God of battles, be our guide, The captain of the hosts That wrestle with each tossing tide And rampart round these coasts. Be Thou our first and last Defence In passing crowds and cries, Amid the pomps of vain pretence Wherein no refuge lies. And mould us if by suffering schools The vassals of Thy voice, To be in all things ready tools More worthy of Thy choice. Thou art the Light wherein we live, Who govern but for Thee; It is Thy greatness, that doth give These borders fair and free. And buttressed by Thy guardian care We walk our stately road, Uplifting as we ever bare The kingdoms' heavy load. Let nothing evil shame or shake One least foundation stone, And with Thy presence awful make The shadow of the throne. We are Thy chosen servants yet In daring and in deed, Though by the darkest ills beset To carry on Thy creed. For while we wield the simple trust That answers to Thy call, Shaped with Thy beauty brave and just, If faint we cannot fall. We have no other stay than Thine, Through evil hours of wrath; O, in Thy power, arise and shine Yet more upon our path! Our walls of iron are but a wraith And strengthless ranks of steel, Without the bulwarks of our faith And hearts that humbly kneel. But Thou, whose edicts loose and bind The nations at Thy will, Art in all Majesty behind Our prayers the Ruler still. So shield from every breath of harms The people of Thy hand, Clothe with Thy thunder England's arms To conquer and command. QUO DEINDE RUIS? Ho, the sword! that sharpens for the fray And the marching of the men Ready to arise from prayer to slay, At the scratching of a pen! Europe one great armèd camp, Echoes with the dreadful tramp Of the millions in their gaudy coats Ripe for flying at each others' throats. Ho, the marching of the men, Who to the same God of mercy call And prepare for murder one and all, At the scratching of a pen! Christ of Peace and Love, our common Lord, Unto whom alike we bend, With this ghastly gospel of the sword What abyss shall be the end? Ho, the guns that clamour for the fray, The eclipse of blood and fire, Grim as devils' own black holiday, At a word upon a wire! Europe, with each death machine, Is one powder magazine, Waiting for the nod and tiny flash Just to make the world almighty smash. Ho, eclipse of blood and fire Shadowed in the future's awful arch, As the multitudes destroying march At a word upon a wire! Christ of Peace and Love our common Lord, Unto whom alike we bend, With this ghastly gospel of the sword What abyss shall be the end? Ho, the myriads of mourners, draped In the garmenting of gloom For the thousands who have not escaped, And the orphans and their doom! Europe with its veilèd brow, Is one cemetery now; And the widows from their haunted sleep Only wake, to curse their loss and weep. Ho, the garmenting of gloom For a babbler or a party whim And the empty loves for ever dim, And the orphans and their doom! Christ of Peace and Love our common Lord, Unto whom alike we bend, With this ghastly gospel of the sword What abyss shall be the end? WHERE IS OLD ENGLAND? Where is the old ascendence, Which as a giant drew In dauntless independence The bow of bitter yew? Where are the iron feet that stood For England on her walls of wood In one unbroken brotherhood, And fought and overthrew? Back to the breast that suckled Our never-beaten sires, Who with base spirit truckled Not to the fiercest fires. Where is the old endurance, Which carried safe to port The ship with stout assurance, And counted striving sport? Where are the iron arms of yore, That in their English quivers bore The lives of twenty men and more, And bled at Agincourt? Back to the mighty mother, That bred and fostered all; And fly the fumes, that smother The empire to its fall. Where is the old defiance, That crumbled thrones as clods; And, with a great reliance, Faced overwhelming odds? Where are the iron acts, that broke Their chains with charters and awoke To conscious power and by it spoke, And knew the battle God's? Back to the breezy fountains, And not the city den; Back to the moors and mountains, That made our English men. Where is the old aggression, Which wantoned in the strife, The glorious indiscretion Uncareful of the life? Where are the iron hearts, that fed On goodly deeds as daily bread, Or chose the hardest field for bed And kissed the altar knife? Back to the streams and meadows, The furrow's fertile track; And freedom, through the shadows, Shall bring our England back. BLOOD BROTHERHOOD. One in the common rights of race, One by the heritage of law, We both look upward in God's face And feel a kindred awe. One in a thousand common ties Which arm us with an equal power, We draw the same grand liberties And from no different dower. We twain were fashioned in the fire And dandled on the stormy flood, Uplifted by one brave desire In brotherhood of blood. One in the love so largely spent For justice and its broader creed, We fought for the enfranchisement Of others in their need. One in our nobleness of claims We never wrought for greed alone, And in the light of lofty aims For errors did atone. We brake no bond or alien sod But to impose a harder band, And brought the charters of our God Unto the darkest land. One in our proud imperial breath, One by the service of the sword, We squander life and laugh at death And own no earthly lord. One in our passion for the truth Whereto through weal and woe we cling, We daily yet renew our youth At the same upper spring. For freedom only do we strike And seldom need to strike again, Who suffer of our choice alike What destinies ordain. One in the glory of intent Which struggles surely to the light, We ask for no arbitrament But the eternal right. One in the majesty of hope Which dares whatever mortal can, And will not heed a lesser scope Than the whole cosmic plan. So must we work together still, Yoke fellows and united friends, In chivalries of good and ill, As kin for common ends. CURSE OF COMPULSION. We English born of gallant sires Who lived for liberty and fought, And wrung their charters from the fires Where they themselves were grander wrought, We who have breathed a purer air And drunk in strength from deeper springs, To build this empire far and fair, Will brook no idle tamperings. Heap on us burdens at your will, O rulers of a day or night, And batten on our plenty still— But do not touch our ancient right. We English have a rugged way, Of acts that speak with thunder voice; And as the potter moulds his clay, We break the creatures of our choice. Sometimes we kick at bars and laws And shatter things to primal shade, When tides that carry States as straws Engulf the idols they have made. Spare not the taxes which we rue, And grind our faces in the dust; But trifle not with freedom's due, Or touch our old and honoured trust. We English love the sacred tome, Wherein each deed of title lies; We bear no stranger in the home, Nor meddling with our liberties. Force has a hateful sound to hearts That never stooped to foreign foe, And choose to play the nobler parts, Whate'er the sacrifice or woe. We are the children of the free, And guard the fortress of the truth; O let the tried foundations be, Nor touch the bulwarks of our youth. We English without favour do The upright thing, like sire and son; And hold our persons precious too, Surrendered at the call of none. We deem these charters are our own, Gained by the service of the sword— Through blood and tears to greatness grown, And fear no Master but the Lord. We grudge not treasure or our toil, Ye rulers of a moment stage; But, if our very lives be spoil, Touch not the solemn heritage. THE YOUNG PRINCE. 23rd June, 1094. O Heir of England's greatness and the power Which justice metes the land, By others vainly striven for but the dower Held in thy baby hand, God-moulded to command, An empire leans on thee as on a tower; Thou last and least, yet grandest of possessors Enriched by every age, Begin thy splendid stage, Which opes a seat among thy dread assessors, Armed with that awe the terror of transgressors, Thy hope and heritage. Born to a freedom which is sadly sought By myriads, but thy right Upon the anvil of the centuries wrought Red-hot to tempered might, And the calm orbèd light Of equal law by blood and iron bought; We cannot give thy brows a brighter glory Than this, long handed down, Buttressed by sword and gown, And wrung as charter from the arena gory, Where heroes fought and statesmen made the story, To be our England's crown. To thee we tender as a solemn trust Our old unsullied fame, The shield that never may take spot or rust, To mingle with thy name, And still abide the same— Deathless, though kingdoms fall and thrones be dust. Take it, and guard our honour as a jewel To shine in darkest needs, The bulwark of our creeds, If trials fall and fortune waxing cruel, Break blessed ties and make foundations fuel— Hold England's title deeds. Keep as thy birthright that fine fear of God, Better than sword and shield, Whereby our fathers in their triumph trod Senate or battle field, Who only thus would yield The homage granted to no tyrant's rod; For promise of more noble generations Rising from conquered harms, And fairer women's charms, The destinies of worlds and unborn nations, Hang on thy baby arms. ENGLAND'S MISSION. God of the thunder, God of the calm, Giveth us hammered hot on red forges Blade of the lightning, though with a balm; Sharpened in shadow's deep dreadful gorges— He who is judgment, and yet is Love; Serving us daily, Serving us gaily Down in the silence, down in the sadness; King over madness, As of the dove. Forth from His labours, scourging the globe, Cometh a Nero Blood-drunk and trailing death as his robe— Cometh the hero. God of our England, God of the true, Fashioned us greatly fit to be Lord's men Dealing around to subjects their due, Bringers of progress, sailors and swordsmen— Destined to conquer peoples and guide; Governing nations, Digging foundations Firm as the rockbed hewn out of granite, Broad as a planet— Throned at His side. Ours is the mission, ours is the seal If it be gory Sometimes and solemn, now to reveal God and His glory. God who is Goodness, God who is Power Ruleth among us mending and making Earth, by the travail sent as our dower— Liberties, grown from shaping and shaking; We are but strengthless tools in His hand. Often with blunted Methods or stunted Wills, in our weakness, sorely we fail Him— Nothing avail Him, Nor His command. But He forgiveth errors, and still Metes us His duties; And, by sweet mercy, out of the ill Worketh more beauties. God of our England, God of the Right Bears with our lapses, leading us forward— Mother of empires, justice and light Scattered as seed cast southward and nor'ward, Into the east lands, into the west. Parliaments slowly, Charters and holy Churches or statutes, rise by us bidden; Rise from the hidden Heaven, in God's Breast; As we go fighting on with His Law, Not looking manward, But all encompassed round in its awe First in the vanward. CROMWELL. Destined man of iron, man of blood, Riding on red revolution's flood To the haven which the craven Never reached who crawled through mud; In thy pillared grandeur standing lone, Not on pedestal of carven stone, But in greatness and sedateness Of the doings that enthrone; Thou dost need no passing bust or line, Nor the shadow of the awful shrine, Thou whose story is the glory Of a mandate most divine. Thou art written on the broadest page Of our brightest one heroic age, When the martyrs won our charters, Walking on the world as stage; Thou art first among the foremost men, Who with no unequal sword or pen, Conquering treasure beyond measure, Brought new truths into our ken; Thou hast wrought for this imperial race Something more than common meed or grace, Living actions, not for factions, But for every time and place. Destined man of visions, with a lot Hammered of eternity red-hot To the stature of a nature Dread in splendour and in spot; Thou didst but for God His battles fight, Not for party, in the solemn light Of the seeing which was being And put on immortal might; Builded on the Everlasting Rock, Native to thee and of one same block, Thou hast beaconed on our weakened Wills alike in shade and shock. Live for ever in the larger mind Of our England and all humankind, By the beauty of that duty Done, which left its breath behind. Who shall compass thy august intents, And thy thoughts' untravelled continents, Thou the maker and the breaker Of mere kings and parliaments? Fate was stamped on thy tremendous brow Clothed with thunder, and its lightning now Is the token thou hast spoken, Words at which yet nations bow. THE CHARGE OF THE 21st LANCERS. Knee to knee, lads, ride and steady In your stirrups, stand and go With a will against the foe, All as one man ranked and ready, Through eclipse and earthquake throe. Break those legions out of joint, Do not tarry, Thrust or parry, Meet their powder with the point; It is England's power you carry, England's honour that you save— On to glory, though a grave. Knee to knee, lads, grip the leather As you front the leaden hail; Do not falter, do not fail; In among them romp together, Reap red harvest with the flail. Lo, an Empire at your heel Greets with gladness Splendid madness— Give them blazes and cold steel. Though they bring you wounds and sadness, Husband every blow and breath; On to triumph, if to death. Knee to knee, lads, grant no quarter, As the Dervish does to you; Strike for England, dare and do, While brave blood is shed as water And you scarce can struggle through. England bids you to the test Of this fighting, And each smiting Buffet pierces her own breast; Ah, a fallen kingdom's righting Is your grand and goodly trust, Should your portion be the dust. Knee to knee, lads, cut a larger Road of light across the gloom— Courage finds a royal room Yet for gallant man and charger, With a portal out of doom. Oh for England ride to-day, Knit as brothers For your mothers And the wives so far away; Though the rich fruits be another's, And your bodies but the path, Great will be the aftermath. THE QUEEN'S WRIT RUNS. Over the shoreland, under the foreland, Inland and always the Queen's Writ runs; None may deny it, none can defy it— None from the dawn to the setting of suns. Blow it out, bugle-man; Tell it forth, fugle-man, Round the wide world to the rolling of guns! Honour it verily, March to it merrily, Holding the path which the Queen's Writ runs. Strong as the mountains, deep as the fountains, Justice is law where the Queen's Writ runs. War with its racket arms the blue-jacket, Red-coat and all, till the Queen's Writ runs; Old earth is prouder, smelling the powder Burnt to make brighter the face of the suns. Misery, stay on it; Sword blade and bayonet, Usher it bringing the flag and the guns! Make of the devilry, Strife and its revelry Carpet of blood where the Queen's Writ runs! Liberty, kindness break through the blindness Darkening the lands, where the Queen's Writ runs. Blessing the wide ways, keeping the tide-ways Open for Empire, the Queen's Writ runs; Bearing new charters, more than the Garter's Ribbon of rank, and sweet of the suns. Thunders its oracle, Where the wild coracle (Pirate or slaver) is scared by its guns; Northerly, Southerly Blasts, by its motherly Mandate are stirred, where the Queen's Writ runs. As on the human breasts of a woman Children are safe, where the Queen's Writ runs. Roof of the nations, freedom's foundations, Sowing the desert the Queen's Writ runs; Peace and its plenty turn one to twenty Corn sheaves, and shadows to ne'er-setting suns. Life waxes glorious, Labours victorious Over fierce odds, at the flash of its guns; Youth and its benison, Love as with venison Feast broken hearts, if the Queen's Writ runs. None shall be longing vainly in wronging Ills for redress, while the Queen's Writ runs. WILSON'S LAST STAND. Shoulder to shoulder they stood, Strong men and good; Only a handful, but still All with one will, Never to fly that last field— Never to yield; Wounded and wearied and spent, Though yet unbent; And if outworn they must lie, Ready to die, Shoulder to shoulder they stood, Strong men and good. Shoulder to shoulder they fought Bravely, and wrought Deeds that were wonders to tell— Each ere they fell. Horses and riders went down, Wrapt in renown; Haloed with history, red Ripe with bloodshed; Broken and slaughter-pursued, But not subdued; Shoulder to shoulder they fought Bravely, and wrought. Shoulder to shoulder they knelt, Wounds never felt; Flashing the pitiless ball, Conquerors all; Famished and sleepless and torn, Faint and forlorn, But with no thought of retreat Or of defeat; Slaying their hundreds and slain, Heedless of pain; Shoulder to shoulder they knelt, Wounds never felt. Shoulder to shoulder they lay, Ghastly and gray, Greeting the doom at the end Rather than bend; Living a centuried life In that great strife, There for our England's old name Harvesting fame, Couched on a glorious bed, Dying and dead; Shoulder to shoulder they lay, Ghastly and gray. “HOLD THE GUN!” A Ballad of the Chitral Campaign. “Hold the gun!” This was the order Of the captain in command, When we met the Hill marauder Under India's fiery sun; And our belts we buckled closer, for we were resolved to stand. Ah, the peril made us bolder, As with shoulder unto shoulder We the game had now begun, All begrimed with smoke and powder Though the enemies were legion and their Mollahs cursed us louder— “Hold the gun!” “Hold the gun!” It was with blazes And red ruin that we spat, Up among those rocky mazes; And our foemen liked the fun, Though we gave them hell and shrapnel and a pretty dose of that; For those charcoal-painted devils Did not shirk the bloody revels, And with patience might have won; But we rammed the charges tighter, And we sent right home their message and our bayonets waved brighter;— “Hold the gun!” “Hold the gun!” It was for glory And the English name we stood, Though the ground was hot and gory, And the beggars would not run; But we knew a soldier's duty, and our purpose still was good. As the battle-cloud hung dimmer, O we longed to see the glimmer Of the steel, though there was none, That showed friends were drawing nearer; But we only saw the whites of hostile eyes, and hope grew drearer;— “Hold the gun!” “Hold the gun!” The shots came quicker, And the Chitral aim was true, While our gallant men fell thicker If they tumbled one by one; And for every pal they potted, we wiped out at least our two. But they rushed on fierce and faster, And the rocks rained down disaster, And the daylight was nigh done; But (you see) we had our order, And we kept a ring of iron round our broken little border;— “Hold the gun!” “Hold the gun!” When we waxed fewer Firm our courage held out yet, And we played in turn pursuer, Giving every mother's son That would face us short damnation with the blooming bayonet. If we met assaults or sallied, Close our thinning ranks we rallied, Though a falling stone might stun Here and there a bleeding brother; We were ready for the loss, and in his place arose another;— “Hold the gun!” “Hold the gun!” When all but honour Now was gone, and England seemed Doomed with black eclipse upon her And her stainless flag undone, Through the hubbub came a cheering, which at first we thought we dreamed; Till with blinded eyes and parching Throats, we heard our comrades marching, And the web that Chitral spun, In a moment then was shattered To the winds, and all those charcoal sketches rubbed clean out or scattered;— “Hold the gun!” NELSON. He washed his face in sea-water, He drank the stinging brine Within his veins as wine; And to the mad wind's dulcimer, He reached as God's own messenger A stature half divine; The sun and clouds alike were good, And storms with him claimed brotherhood; While all the motion of the ocean In free and tameless flood, With all the graces of wide spaces, Was mingled in his blood. He shaped his course as gallant ships, That travel fast and far Beneath the pilot star; The tempest taught him with its whips And battle out of iron lips, That Duty known no bar; And thus from adverse shades and shocks, To stepping-stones grew stumbling-blocks; And the wild shudder of the rudder Was music to his ears, The salt surge savour built him braver Of splendid faiths and fears. His roof was but the open sky, His walls the open air, And with their freshness fair He learnt as stately days went by The secret of Eternity, The riddle of despair: And thence came ready to his hand, The royal instinct of command; And by his folding trials' moulding He gathered conquering will, And from their cruel furnace fuel Plucked victory out of ill. Thereby he quarried him a name For ever broad and bright, Which is our beacon light; And his is one with England's fame That carries down its scorn of shame, To be our common right; And still he holds our country's helm, The guide and glory of the Realm: And now with thunder voice the wonder Of his tremendous charge, A signal flying on undying, Shall write our history large. THE BLUE RIBAND OF THE SEA. Let England will to do it, And every mother's son Would give his life unto it And wager it be done. There's many a good life spoiling For just a gallant spin, A-fire for tasks of toiling And ready to romp in. So launch the merry ship, my boys, And gaily voyage forth; Let women stay at home with toys, We'll go a-sailing North. Let England find the money, And all will furnish men (Not nursed on milk and honey), To venture there and then. Stout hands will turn from tilling, And hearts (that never fear'd A foe) be more than willing, To pluck the Ice-king's beard. So send the merry ship, my lads, By frozen cape and Forth; Leave politicians' fuss and fads, And go a-sailing North. Let England raise a finger, Towards that dim Arctic Zone; And would a seaman linger, To dare the Ice-king's throne? With passion would be blended The myriads' rival plea, To win and wear that splendid Blue riband of the sea. So man the merry ship, my boys, And prove your iron worth; Leave clerks and girls their quiet joys, And go a-sailing North. Let England only ask it, And poverty would spare Or empty store and basket, To have a little share. While others feast and fiddle Or lounge in silken rest, Our knights will read the riddle Locked in the Ice-king's breast. So speed the merry ship, my lads, And bravely journey forth; Thank God, we yet have Galahads To go a-sailing North. BOOT AND SADDLE. A True Incident in the Matabele Campaigm. Mashangombi's was the rat-hole, Which we had to draw ere day, Heedless whether this or that hole— If we only found a way; Up among the iron furrows Of the rocks, where packed in burrows Safe the rats in shelter lay. No misgiving, not a fear— Nor was I the last astraddle Who kept straining nerve and ear, When the bugle sounded clear— “Boot and saddle!” Right away went men and horses, Both as eager for the fun; Through the drifts and dried-up courses, Where like mad the waters run After storms or through the winters, Mashing all they meet to splinters— Ready, hand and sword and gun. Every eye was keen to mark, And the tongue alone seemed idle As we scanned each crevice dark— Bit and bridle! Here and there the startled chirrup Of strange creatures, as we go Standing sometimes in the stirrup, Just to get a bigger show; Till we gain our point, the entry— There the pass, no sign of sentry, Not a sound above, below! Clear the coast, the savage gave Never hint to south or norward; Was he napping in his cave, With that quiet like the grave?— Steady, forward! Further in; the rats were sleeping; We would grimly smoke them out, With a dose of lead for keeping And a fence of flame about; They might wake perhaps from shelter, At our bullets' ghastly pelter, To the brief and bloody rout!— But, next moment, we were wrapt Down to saddle girth and leather In the fire of foes unmapt; We were turned, and fairly trapt— “Keep together!” On they pour in thousands, hurling Steel that stabbed and belching ball From a host of rifles, curling Serpent-wise around us all. Front and flank and rear, they tumbled Nearer, darker, as we fumbled— Till we heard the Captain's call, “Each man for himself, and back!” So we rushed those rocky mazes, With that torrent grim and black Dealing ruin in our track— Death and blazes! Ah, that bullet! How it shattered Vein and tissue to the bone; Dropt me faint and blood-bespattered, Helpless on a bed of stone! While the mare which oft had eaten From my hand, caressed, unbeaten, Left her master doomed, alone. Limply then I lay in dread, Racked with torture, sick and under— Hearing, as through vapours red And with reeling heart and head, Hoofs of thunder! Was I dreaming? By the boulder Where I huddled as I fell, Stood the steed beside my shoulder Faithful, fain to serve me well. Whinnying softly, then, to screen me From the foe, she knelt between me And that circling human hell. Tenderly she touched my face With the nose that knew my petting, Ripe for the last glorious race And her comrade's own embrace— Unforgetting! O her haunches heaved and quivered With the passion freely brought For the life to be delivered, Though she first with demons fought; While her large eyes gleamed and glistened And her ears down-pointing listened, Waiting for the answer sought. Till a sudden wave of might Set me once again astraddle On the seat of saving flight, Plucked from very jaws of night— Boot and saddle! ATBARA. Mahmoud silent lay and surly Hid in desert scrub and thorn, While the sand-wind gray with gurly Blasts upon our face was borne; Some would never see the morn, Though they longed for stroke of steel and the battle's hurly-burly. Every face was set and knitted With the stirring of the strain, And each ready right hand fitted To its weapon, which the slain Soon would give a splendid stain— What were wounds or death, if life in the act were well acquitted? Ring of flame and roar of thunder Now from silence sudden brake, Wrath above the ruin under With a voice avenging spake, As if hell itself, awake, Vomited red fury forth, out of earth that rent asunder. Then the rush of men and horses After iron rain and blast, Bolts of doom on destined courses As by one great engine cast; Hungry for the prey at last, Sure and swift like rolling seas hurled in hate from ocean sources. Glorious moments, full as ages With the passion of the fight, While we seemed to tread the stages Of a universe of light; Death itself were pure delight, As we faced those fearful odds and in blood wrote dazzling pages. Waved the flag in front, a vision And a promise of our due, When the sword with sharp decision Through those mazes cut a clue; White and black were comrades true, And the vaunted Dervish might turned to weakness and derision. So we reaped the harvest, brother, With the point and bitter blade, In a whirl of smash and smother And the dreadful din and shade; Thus at last was reckoning made, And I hardly deem the foe now will ask us for another. Ah, we did remember Gordon With Khartoum and all the shame, Showing England was the warden Of true freedom and old fame; And our grand imperial name Now will shake the farthest East, from the Nile unto the Jordan. THE LONG RIGHT HAND. With our strong right hand and our long right hand We have broken the desert dearth, And the thin red line is an iron band Which has girdled around the earth; And the slave-whip's crack from our conquering track Has fled with its crimson crime, And old England's sword that would serve the Lord Has begun the better time. With our long right hand and our strong right hand We have sentinelled half the globe, For the ocean isle and the Indian land Are the gems of our country's robe. With our glorious wont and victorious front We have gathered the peoples in, Till they bathed in our blessed Freedom's font And awoke to a common kin. For our briny walls and the palace halls And our fame beneath the skies, Have not builded us fair with the sun and air— But the breath of our liberties. With our glorious wont and victorious front, We have bridled all winds and waves; While we scatter the powers of woe and want, On the path of our heroes' graves. In our fearless way to the tearless Day We have harnessed the fire and flood, And the fields most far from its quickening ray Are enriched by our martyrs' blood. We have borne on our breast for the sufferers' rest The worst wounds of the battle shock, That the feeblest race might receive some grace And a home in our equal Rock. In our fearless way to the tearless Day We have carried the lamp of Truth, And the kingdoms crushed by a tyrant sway Have arisen to dawn of youth. With our long right hand and our strong right hand We have leavened the world with law, And the nations now all enfranchised stand In the shade of its sheltering awe. We have planted and sowed, we have never owed But we paid with a double meed; And the earth is more great than its old estate, From the fruits of our gallant creed. With our strong right hand and our long right hand, We have shattered the league of Ill; And the harvest won, from the sire to son, We will keep for our children still. THE GREAT POWDER MAGAZINE.

Great Cecil, of a stately stock Built into England's centuried rock, A worthy scion thou; Thy head in England's need grown grey, And foremost on our cosmic way, May well with Empire bow. But thy stout heart, serenely sure Of purpose and in power secure, Hath never once been bent; And as on some predestined course, Untouched by fear, unmoved by force, Thou guidest Parliament. The farthest whisper of lone lands, The people's will, the Queen's commands, The murmur of the mart; Alike art heard, and turned by thee To make our country yet more free, And fill a nobler part. The ugly shape of shadowed ill Is tamed by thee, and moulded still To its true destiny; Thou hast the statesman's prophet dower, Which looks beyond the passing hour Into eternity. If others fail, thou flinchest not From burdens which are thy grand lot, By thee with beauty graced; Ah, nothing little, vain or mean, And nothing common or unclean Is in thy record traced. Our charters are thy gems and gold, And sweet in thine imperial hold As breath of English skies; Most gentle is thy rule and just, And safe and honoured the proud trust Of our old liberties. But dearest is our Church, the shrine Doth with thy homage fairer shine Upon a broader stage; For thou hast guarded and wilt guard Her treasure and her Truth unscarred, As our chief heritage. And though mid cares of high intents Thy heart to Science oft consents, The hand is on this Realm; And like some planet's awful sweep Moves on our England, while we keep A Cecil at the helm. TO THE BLUEJACKET. Come, tread the blue waves under, Walk as the ocean free; Clothed is thine arm with thunder, All England goes with thee. O at thy country's calling Thou dost not heedless hark, And into night if falling Wilt leave a dazzling dark. But live to fight her battles, And love to conquer too, When rain of iron rattles, And blasts of buffets woo. Thou art not struggling lightly, For fortune and thy fame; Nor singly set, if rightly Uplifting our grand name. Its majesty, its greatness Are bucklered to thy breast; And all its calm sedateness, Strong as a sea at rest. Strike, as if on thee only Hung endless good and ill; Thou art not standing lonely, With thee strikes England still. Now fearless take thy journey Farther than eye can see, And face the fiercest tourney— All England goes with thee. So put a bit and bridle Upon the furious north, Let not that hand be idle Which Duty summons forth. And break the billows' anger With guiding rein and whip, Until they sink to languor And fawn in fellowship. The tempests are the horses Which thou wilt gaily ride, And on their maddest courses Thou bravest every tide. But nowise turn or tarry, With thy most precious freight; Remember, thou dost carry A glorious Empire's weight. Then for our gracious Mother And for our common rights, Strive, as if strove no other— With thee all England fights. O in the name of Order, One with the strength of three, Push onward Freedom's border— All England goes with thee. For Truth, whate'er betide thee, Carve into night a track; God is Himself beside thee— A people at thy back. For justice and the beauty Of blessed Light and Law, Show earth Heaven's face in Duty— Its loveliness of awe. The waters are thy meadow, Thy throne the iron crag; And rests on thee, the shadow Of our unsullied flag. On some one with the morning Our destiny may shine, Eternity's adorning— To-day it may be thine. Watch, though the breakers bellow In stormy gulfs or straits, As if thou hadst no fellow— With thee all England waits. Come, to stern romps and racket Which timid sailors flee, War makes the bold bluejacket— All England goes with thee. The hope of future ages, A blessing for each land, Are but the golden pages Now written by thy hand. Repose is sweet, and pleasant Kisses of wedded wife; But, in thy spacious Present, Lies others' boundless life. Be true to God's vocation, And to thyself be true; Thou buildest a foundation, Which centuries may rue. Thine individual action Is no small separate thing, A passing gust of faction— But an almighty spring. Let nought turn back thy trying, Or leave a shameful mark; Brave deeds are not for dying, And blossom in the dark. Live in whatever station The call of honour gives, As if thou wast the nation— With thee all England lives. OUR FRONTIER MEN. With the meeting Of the dusk and dawn I hear them, And in silences am near them. At the greeting And the iron play of swords Ringing round our battle lords, There they stand On their guard or bravely gallop, Wardens of the world and English land, Pioneers of English might, English law and English light. Where the Eskimo's adventuring shallop Would not voyage, there they stay Watchers of the night and day, Sternly still, Armoured in the justice that is power; Or through parching Wildernesses grimly marching Seek to do God's grand and holy will, While they bid the desert laugh and flower. Tall and stately, Lo, they prize not petty spoiling And demand no due but toiling Spent sedately. Conscious of a work in deeds, Better than the strife of creeds To be done; They endure the heat and burden, Wardens of the world and finely one In their sufferings and their plan To complete what God began, Clothed in greatness as a proper guerdon. Freedom is their breath, and force From the Fountain's deeper source Flows in veins Channeled by the awful tide of Time; And the ocean With its boundless breadth and motion, Nerves their hands for the imperial reins, Weds their hearts to the imperial chime. Come their voices With a cheery challenge falling Far away, and at its calling Earth rejoices. They are very calm and strong, And they hate the thought of wrong Loving right; Hand on blade or foot in stirrup, Wardens of the world and men's delight, Pioneers of precious truth Giving back the old their youth. Cry, as feeble as the nestling's chirrup, Reaches them, and sends them forth Champions of the South and North, To redress Outrages that else were borne in shame; And the thunder Of their horses' hoofs beats under Evil, with the rule of righteousness, In the dreadful and most Blessed Name. High and solemn Is their character and carriage, Where the great and meek in marriage Build one column. Duty raises them as kings Far above all meaner things, To their charge— Liberty, to serve the nations; Wardens of the world, they keep the marge Of our frontiers clear and just, Equal to the awful trust And lay charters on their fair foundations. They are proudly bred and born To a hope that were forlorn, But for faith In the mighty mission that they hold; As appointed, And with blood and fire anointed To pursue no idle end or wraith, Heaping up for others grain and gold. THE WALLS OF ENGLAND. What are the walls of England that fence our frontiers round, And make a mighty shadow as dread as holy ground? O not the ring of iron Wrought by our gallant ships, Which awfully environ The land with thunderous lips; And not the crimson surges crested with lightning steel, Which break the stoutest barriers beneath our conquering heel; Nor yet the wealth of nations Heaped in her merchants' hold— No greed her firm foundations, Nor are her bulwarks gold. What are the walls of England which keep our country strong, When kingdoms pass and perish, and rampart us from wrong? The liberties, the charters Baptised in precious blood, And wrung for us by martyrs From bitter fire and flood; The creed which is our glory with many a splendid spot, All fashioned on fierce forges and hammered out red hot; The freedom which we carry Along our broadening way, That lingers (if it tarry) To spread a brighter day. What are the walls of England whereon we greatly rest, The buttresses and bastions that mould our Mother's breast? The love of right and order Which gather us one guild, And gird us with a border Of empires we upbuild; The law which lights our progress and scatters plenty wide, Co-partner with the mercy that sitteth at God's side; The justice joined to pity Above an action mean, Dealt out to man or city, On which the suffering lean. What are the walls of England by ages set and sure, A fortress to the feeble, a hiding-place secure? It is the Truth we treasure, Our father's sacred trust, Which works in all its pleasure And saveth souls from rust; The franchise which it giveth to tender hearts and true, That ask no sordid wages and seek but others' due; The faith that is not bounded, And heeds no earthly shock— These are our walls, and founded On the Eternal Rock. WELLINGTON. Hewn out of rock, a marble man, He laid upon his heart One love (in England's larger plan), And changed all Europe's chart. In blood he sowed the blessed seed Of liberty and life, And fashioned duty as our creed Out of the awful strife. And thus he gave us goodly bounds, From battles' bitter lore; Fought out on Eton's playing grounds, And mimic fights before. Silent and swift with ready hand To parry blows or thrust, He bore the burden of command As a great soldier must. His prescient gaze saw through each plot, In adverse hour or clime; And, when he struck, he needed not To strike a second time. He shared his counsels but with God, And moulded grand his age; Invincible and stern, he trod A solitary stage. He had no equal—to his end, Through thunder, fire and mist He moved—and who would dare contend, With the protagonist? And (as no rival could) he kept The nations in his hold, And to the cannon music stept Like demigods of old. He never slaked a vulgar thirst At any common source, But rose by nature up the first In right of utter force. As Atlas did upraise the sky, He guarded England's gate; For in his heart was destiny, And in his fortune fate. Above the lowly cares of men He looked to future times, And heard with calm and broader ken Afar the fuller chimes. And thus a beacon still he stands Beyond all shade and shock, And builded on no fleeting sands But in our country's rock. THE FLAG OF ENGLAND. What is the flag of England? Rise, from forgotten graves And witness to its grandeur, enfranchised souls and slaves. The shadow of its glory, the shelter of its roof Takes the wide world beneath it, nor leaveth one aloof. Its hospitable greatness, its universal breast Is open to the exile and gives all peoples rest. Force cannot live without it, fear does not dwell within, And from its mighty presence the purer times begin. O awful and imperial it lifts the lowly head, And falls in dew and sunshine 'twixt dying hopes and dead. It blazes o'er the vanward in every noble strife, And has on earth no frontiers but liberty and life. Where is the flag of England? Ask of the winds, that blow On sand like burning lava and fields of Arctic snow; Ask of the waves that thunder round coral isles, and beat For ever at the portals of death's ice-armed seat. And O when suns are setting, or foemen at the gate Of weakness knock in terror, it rises above fate. The shield of its protection confronts each iron shock, And rolls the flood of evil back like a refuge rock. As in a sacred fortress, it gathers to its side The weary and the wounded, ere washed beneath the tide. It is the rallying centre on desert coast or crag, And when all light has faded shines on the English flag. THE THUNDER RAM. All the winds of earth and heaven With the lightning for their leaven, Ready rushed to battle out; All the angry rolling waves Tossed abroad like troubled graves, Smote in vain her iron snout; As she forged along the path Of her predetermined wrath, Where would be no aftermath Blown afar in wreck and rout; For the reaping and the heaping, If death rode again about. With the churning of her tread fast Over billows, stern and steadfast, Went that prodding iron nose; Dark and dreadful, in the light Of its own deep native night, And that fixed and final pose; Silent as the foot of fate In its march of destined state, Sure, however long or late, At the glooming of the close; To the shudder of the rudder, Sank the sun a bloody rose. At the throats of hostile thunder Drave the Death-trap, and asunder Clove the ranks of ridgèd swell; While the crimson sweat poured down Plashing decks, but could not drown Purpose grim, though hundreds fell; Splinters flew, and broken spars Wedded fractured bolts and bars, Mid a rain of fiery stars— Howling shot and shrieking shell. But to glory ploughed the gory Monster, through that blinding hell. OUR PIONEERS. They are riding, they are riding past the outposts in the van, Over deserts lone and dreary as they were since time began; Through the solitude and silence, with the heavens above as brass And the iron ground beneath them like a furnace, as they pass; While the bleached and blasted remnants and the bones of younger earth, And the skeletons of cities vast as worlds, bestrew the dearth With the fragments of the fallen and the mighty that are dust, Where the temples once were crowded and for ages wreaked their lust. But they ride abroad in duty and they do not count the price, If the lives they give are lavished in a solemn sacrifice; For the honour of the nation which has sealed and sent them forth, With her mandate and new charters from the freedom of the North. They are sailing, they are sailing where no keel has voyaged yet, Over tumbling bars and billows with adventuring canvas set; In the toy boat, or with thunder of a floating fortress round Driving back the ring of evil and enlarging freedom's bound; At the helm of duty always going out to seek and save, As the pioneers of progress—if they only leave a grave. Wild the wind may rave and rally to destroy them, and the surge Beat against them as they voyage with the fury of its scourge; But across the sultry ocean or beneath the Arctic sky They are speeding fearless forward with the foot of destiny. They have bitted storms and bridled the great tideways with their law, As they bear for God and country justice with its blessed awe. They are standing, they are standing in the watchtowers of the East, At the awful post of Duty 'mid the fiercer foe and beast; Where the crag on precipices, perching like an eagle's nest, Throws across a hundred mountains the red beacon in its breast. With the ready sword and rifle, they are armoured most in pride— That they keep the walls of England, which is watching at their side. Through the blazing suns of noontide and the bitter cold and dark There they stand with steadfast waiting, or lie down in ruin stark; But they would not change their service and the burden that it brings, For the bondage of the idle or the silken sloth of kings. They uphold a famous Empire and our liberties and faith, In that vantage-ground of glory which is not a passing wraith. They are kneeling, they are kneeling and above a crimson sod, When the battle rage is over—but they only kneel to God; And they pray to Him for guidance, and they praise Him for the might Which has bucklered them in peril and encompassed in the fight. For they draw their grand commission and security of power From the Lord of Hosts who sceptred their forefathers with His dower. And they lean upon the bulwarks of His Providence, and march To the music of His orders 'neath the heavens that overarch. But the strength with which He clothes them, or the sharpness of their swords, Cometh not from earthly treasures—but its secret is the Lord's. So they cannot choose but conquer, and the darkness from them flees, When the victory beforehand first was won upon their knees. SONG OF DAWNRISE. England, awake! The pillars tremble, And those that (suckled at thy breast) partake Of all the grandeur and with thee have grown, No more dissemble The doubts which littleness had never known. Gird on the dreadful sword, Estate thy ships With thunder for the battles of the Lord Who goes before and speaketh through thy lips; And choose the smiters Who turn not from the face of any foe Or fiery throe, But march straight on to their predestined end, World-righters, And to their purpose bend Along a path appointed The arms of iron like vessels of the clay Refashioned in their proud imperial way, As God's anointed. The time for slumber Hath passed and lo, it strikes, the fated hour, Decreed for action under this gray sky From all eternity. Put off thy silken cumber And use of gentle arts and elegance, Put on the dower Which is thy glory and inheritance Of awful Power; And in the splendour of that dress Which is the cause of righteousness, Go forward; Though to the dimness, now yet closer drawn, The shy dear shadow of the coming dawn. And on the bitted and the bridled wave, That loyal slave Which wafts thee shoreward The tribute of each farthest clime and coast, Launch thy stout fleets, and let the banner fly Which is the enfranchised nations' boast Of law and liberty. England, awake! For enemies are greedy and arise In braggart weakness, And think thy sons are fearful and forsake The duty which their daring fathers led; And fools despise The day of meekness, Won only by the blood so richly shed. Horizons darken, And on the anvil of the patient years The sickle sharpens, from the toils and tears Of suffering souls and damned and dying, Which thou alone canst wield In the red harvest-field. The kingdoms hearken For that true charter, which shall bid them be Themselves and free; And all the earth is crying For justice unto God, who rules by thee. WRITTEN IN RED. Spread the Empire further, faster, Spread the justice and the law, Let the countries know their master— British peace and awe; Let the strife for ages rife Cease and sword and cannon rust, And the nations firm foundations Root in settled trust; Write the map a broader red Over field and over flood, In the life so bravely shed By our English blood. Rolls the tide that as the ocean Sweeps away the wrong and ill, Leaving triumphs of devotion— Quarried mine and mill; As our race in royal place Built upon its creed, Pushes forward, southward, nor'ward, Still with iron deed; While before our progress path Chartered by the Holy Page, Fall the tyrannies of wrath For our heritage. Spread the Empire onward ever With the faith its sure ally, Piloted by great endeavour Forth to fairer liberty: Let the prate of ethnic hate Hold its bitter stream at length, While from prison lands arisen Stay upon our strength; Write the map a deeper red Over flood and over field, Till the peoples safely tread Under England's shield. Ours the word that more than charters Binds the kingdoms into one, Sealed by service of the martyrs Grandly dared and done; Ours the lot without a spot To control the future fate, And by splendid doom attended Earth to educate; Ours the destiny and thought All for others and to save, If the brighter world be wrought Only of our grave. CUSTODES PATRIÆ. O ye who hold our country's honour dear, And stand betwixt us and a hundred dangers, To which your watch and wisdom are not strangers Nor swerve a moment for the taunt or tear; When rolls the thunder and horizons under Grow gray with menace of some monstrous fear, We look to you to rend the clouds asunder And guide us safely through the darkness drear, If friends we trusted fail or swords have rusted From peace which preys upon a kingdom's life, We know that you will shape to glory strife Out of the sloth with which we are encrusted. Our liberties are your most solemn stake, A charge to keep in their heroic measure With stern delight of duty, as a treasure Which centuries of suffering toiled to make; The charters lifted out of shadows rifted By iron arms which not a world could shake From their high purpose, and by sorrow sifted To blessings of which all the lands partake. This mandate calling with its noble thralling To you is sacred and a joy and might, And it will lead us somehow to the light Upon the rock from which there is no falling. Yet not for party and the golden place Of power direct us against ill and error, But let the love of right which is a terror To adversaries yield you strength and grace. And bravely holding if through death's dim Folding The principles which buttress this fair State, Be sure your spirit wears the hardy moulding Which is alike our peril and our fate. And not for favour with its flattering savour Turn once aside to any lesser goal, But steer us straight by rugged shore and shoal By paths which have the ocean's breadth and Flavour. With you abides the custody of creeds Which if ye guard them will wax grand and purer, And more than battle and its blades are surer Bulwarks for all our many-nationed needs; And with your caring jealous and unsparing Do worthy acts to be immortal seeds, And live fresh history in the gentle daring Which proves and yet renews our title-deeds. But for your station draw each inspiration From the sole Fountain never spoiled or spent, As much the first as last arbitrament, Which is our England's one illumination. TO THE PREMIER. Est Modus in Rebus. To thee, grand Cecil, in the rush of things Around us and the tumult at our gate, The shakings and the overshadowings, We turn; to one who can with peril cope In sure serenity of anchored hope, Which finds occasions even in adverse fate Commensurate with need. Thy larger look Foresees beyond the bubbles of the times With quantitative vision the full book And far completed orb of change and chance, Above the babble of brute circumstance, And the one moment ethical that chimes With the eternal truth beneath them all. No aimless edicts falter from thy lip Schooled to the uses of wide statesmanship, And quick to snatch from evils ere they fall Advantage still, with staid consummate art Of equal hand and no unequal heart Sedate and fixed. And in these troubled years, Which travail with insufferable fears, When enemies are loud and some unseen; Lo, thou dost bring a true proportioned mind To meet the shock of battle, and between The banded bars of hate to note the wind Of vaster other currents, that will bear Our vessel to the port where it would be; Through storms that waft us forward, though they wear An angry face, and buffets that make free. The stumbling-blocks to thee are only stairs Uplifting to a blue and better sky, And big with rifts of opportunity. There is a measure in all men's affairs, Known unto him who needs not refuges Of desperation, like the gambler's leap, But steers a course of straight observances With the ripe touch and educated glance. Here is our strength, a bulwark broad and cheap, Whereon the bases of this isle's romance Rest, in the rocking of a hundred waves And cruel weathers. England looks to thee. Thou hast the philosophic eye to see Horizons of the future, and in graves The cradles of yet new adventures meet, When this huge world will be one native street. Thou hast the strong imperial arm to strike And bless with sovereign Ministries alike, Or reach across the kingdoms; and thy voice Is law and light to dim and distant shores, Where anarchy is the sole government, And in its thunder music realms rejoice Through all their heaving night incontinent And yield to thee their faith and richer stores. Thy deep deliberate policies are just And clothed with mercy like a royal dress, A might more awful from its gentleness. Thy will is deed and destiny. No gust Of passion or an idle prejudice Shall bid thee swerve a hairsbreadth from thy track As foredecreed as duty, nor the wrack Of toppling thrones or worlds of sacrifice Doomed. Treaties come and go, a poor defence Against an armed and hostile Europe. Thou Art rooted in the rock of principles, Which cannot veer and do not ever bow Unto the backwash of blind outrun creeds, Abiding in their own magnificence; And at the tideways of great thoughts that roll In the interpreting of higher needs, For ever on by ordered miracles Of services and fine intents that flower And fruit in glory of a chastened power, The earth to its inevitable goal. THE MAKING OF THE ENGLISHMAN. Sometimes, in grim and ghastly merriment, Nature appeared to fashion frames Of useless build and ugly names, That were more suited for a cerement; As if, by way of blind experiment, Indulgences in gruesome games. She seemed one sporting with her tools In ceaseless play and curious trying, At leisured labour dimly plying Her work and forming worlds and fools; And learning still herself, in schools Of awful mirth and pain and dying. She seemed to aim at something vaster While scarcely knowing what she sought, Though through the œons long she wrought With threads of dawning and disaster; Because she could not make the Master, Consummate in his act and thought. She mixed the iron and moulded clay With every sort of mighty leaven, The flames of hell, the bliss of heaven; She mingled with the sword to slay The passion both of night and day, And mystery of the virtues seven. So then, with wind that shakes the Norlands, She fused the glory of the sea And sunny freshness of the lea; She took the stubborn strength of forelands, And blent it with the shade of shorelands Which listen to the wild waves' plea. The blood of grapes, the cruel frost And all the sweet and all the bitter, The coarsest grain, the fineness fitter She dashed with snow of peaks uncrost And dreadful spaces tempest-tost— But tuned them with the songbird's twitter. The salt of gray unvoyaged ocean Where never yet a sail was spread, Without a bottom for the lead, She joined to gentlest maid's devotion And wrath of maddest mad commotion Which breaks the shackles of the dead. She chose the rooting of the tree By storm and heat and winter harried, The stillness where no strife has tarried In solitude that none may see; And cheered them with whate'er is free, By hate unwarped, by love upcarried. She poured the courage of the martyr Into her work, the wealth of air, The climbing of the temple stair, And duty far too proud to barter One right for all enchantments fair— And gave to it her broadest charter. The wandering splendour of the sky, The enterprise that can't be headed To fierceness of the fire she wedded, And forged red-hot to liberty; But deep down in eternity, The bases of its life were bedded. The fulness of a perfect stature, With beauty from the forest lone And pureness as a bridal zone, She linked to love of legislature; And adding power in judicature, She hardened this to grit of stone. But then she blessed her finished plan And breathed into it true divinity, Large frankness, grace of shy virginity— Whatever mortal may or can; And thus she made the Englishman, Of homely earth and high infinity. RUSSIAN PEACE. “Russia continues to pursue her policy of peace.” The Times, 1 May, 1896. We know the feelings of the fox To geese and fowls are pure devotion, If mainly meant for his promotion— While his good taste is orthodox. We know the wolf for tender sheep, If they should chance to think it harder, Combines affection with his ardour Determined what he gets to keep— In calm of death's unwaking sleep, With love that's bounded by the larder. And Russia's kindness has no lease, An endless “Policy of Peace.” Religiously she on her path Of civilizing power and progress, Pursues her mission like an ogress And leaves us even no aftermath. Devouring in her Christian creed A valley here and there a village, She ploughs the land with ruddy tillage And broadcast sows the generous seed; She makes all prostrate kingdoms bleed, And gives them to the Cross and pillage; Wipes out in rapine each rude crease, And wires a “Policy of Peace.” But here the Khanates pave her road And even the Afghan realm she fingers, Or at the gate of China lingers And wants to ease her heavy load. There on the Pamirs is her mat, And everywhere she cuts new slices Or makes a tool of Turkish vices; She trifles with the Persian cat, And pushes closer to Herat The hand that threatens or entices. The rouble is the ready grease, To smooth her “Policy of Peace.” Yes, Russia labours with the Lord For others and her little coffers, And to confiding peoples offers The blessings of her faith and sword. Stout Missionaries bear her arms With sisters, candlesticks and crosses, The sacred bones and private glosses, And all her panoply of charms; To heal the Abyssinians' harms, And soothe the Negus for his losses. While as the graves on graves increase, She spreads her “Policy of Peace.” Her philanthropic raids in lust Of land go on, though rather grimly, To those who read her mandate dimly In burning towns and wrack and dust. We mark a silence sad and cold Bequeathed to every subject nation, Which humbly bows to her salvation; It savours of the winter's hold, Or quiet in the burial mould And the still churchyard's desolation. But yet her mercies do not cease, And show her “Policy of Peace.” HER MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY. Here is health to her and wealth to her, The First Lady of the Land; And all honour rest upon her, With fresh empire for her hand. To the Good Queen in her pureness, May the future times yet bear Only blessing and secureness, And a brighter crown to wear. For she walks in love and beauty Like the sunshine of our coast, And the troth she keeps with duty In our buttress and our boast. Here is health to her and wealth to her, The First Lady of the Land; May the highways and the byeways Be content with her command. May the reverence of the nations Be the safeguard of her seat, From the Arctic constellations To the fiery Afric heat. May a thousand subject races For her justice make a road, While they prove her gentle graces Which would share their heaviest load. Here is health to her and wealth to her, The First Lady of the Land; And may weakness, in the meekness Of her mercy, stronger stand. For her word is law and carries Hope to men and liberty, And to sufferers though it tarries Yet her will is destiny. Life is she to prostrate masses, And the shadow of her throne Is the light of all the classes, And they lean on her alone. Here is health to her and wealth to her, The First Lady of the Land; O may order be her border, And in peace her bulwarks plann'd. May our love uplift her station And for ever on it fall, For in truth she lays foundation And of worship builds her wall. Yes, from pavement to the steeple Where the bells her praises sound, May the prayers of the whole people Like a garment wrap her round. WILD OATS. The night was dark as the darkest hell, But his heart it throbbed like a marriage bell— Hurrah! For he saw his duty and did it well, Where the red ground reeked as the harvest fell— Hurrah! He had chosen it all of his own free will, To spike the gun and its iron ill— Hurrah! Which of awful death had drunk its fill, And was belching doom and murder still— Hurrah! He had lost his fortune and fame, and now There was grim resolve on the wrinkled brow— Hurrah! And his breast was stirred with a fiery vow, If he broke yet his purpose would not bow— Hurrah! He was merely a wreck and a ruined man, Till their beamed in his soul a broader plan— Hurrah! By a road that through splendid danger ran, And the drum-beat of true life began— Hurrah! For the steadfast nerves were as tense as steel, And the conquered vices crouched at heel— Hurrah! And he only longed for the battle reel Where blow meets blow, and the vanquished kneel— Hurrah! He could share with none the doubtful deed, And the dreadful joy that had given him speed— Hurrah! He must stand alone in his desperate need, And of flame reforge his soldier's creed— Hurrah! And its youth returned to the ready hand, He was clothed in the glory of his land— Hurrah! O it brightened every evil brand, And his look had the lightning of command— Hurrah! In a smother of smoke, in a blaze of fire Which wrapped him round in a warrior's tire— Hurrah! With the jewels none may get for hire, He drew to the goal of his grand desire— Hurrah! There was riving flesh, with the feint and thrust, And those demon figures laid in dust— Hurrah! With a strong straight point and a simple trust In the Lord of Hosts, and a quarrel just— Hurrah! There were shouts and curses and singing lead, And a lane between dying forms and dead— Hurrah! With the crimson sweat so freely shed, And the onward one predetermined tread— Hurrah! And no sense of pain or a single fear, But a sound of thunder in his ear— Hurrah! As if earth and heaven at last were near, And a wandering soul to God made dear— Hurrah! He will wash with blood the accusing stains, And burst in fight the prisoner's chains— Hurrah! And delight in wounds and count them gains, Be it life or death that the hour ordains— Hurrah! So he spiked the gun before dawn of day, And to victory thus he led the way— Hurrah! Which over his bleeding body lay, And kept an upheaving world at bay— Hurrah! THE THIN RED LINE. Closer up, Tommy, stand To the colours and strike For the Queen and our country and all; Give them hell out of hand, If we suffer alike— We will conquer them yet, though we fall, Let them boast of their numbers and strength, And feel certain to win With the odds and their swagger at length, And as devils environ; We will merely go in, With hot blood and cold iron. Rally round the old flag, Tommy, bracing your powers To hit hard for its honour and fame; Ravelled down to a rag By the bullets in showers, But unvanquished and flying the same. They shall get a good belly full now And a gorier bed, Than they wanted who thought we would bow; Through the smoke and its mazes, With sheer powder and lead Reaping death and red blazes Fill in, Tommy, the blanks Made by shell and the shot That we would not escape if we might; They may riddle our ranks, It is part of the lot For a soldier and duty's delight. Send it home, every ball, every thrust, Knock their line out of joint And their noses as well in the dust; Let's agree just to differ At the bayonet's point, And leave some of them stiffer. If they are ten to one, Tommy, think of the glee When the fighting is over and past; Work remains to be done, While our England is free And a wrong to redress-though the last. They are breaking before our firm face, And their regiments reel As we lock in a deadly embrace; They grow weak, we wax bolder; Steady now, and blue steel Straight and true from the shoulder. SONG OF EMPIRE. O we need not stick at trifles and a thousand leagues or two— It was English brains or rifles that have shown us what to do, And the only way to winnings through the war-shock and the shade From the seeds of small beginnings to the fruitful bough and blade. Up the Congo, and the Niger, with the Tamil or the tiger, He has spread his rugged speech; And his justice is the haven, which the captive and the craven From their misery beseech. While the kingdoms take their easy course or trifle with the hem, He is sounding the Zambesi with his national “Goddem;” If you rake the lowest gutter or the North Pole in your plan, You will find before the stutter of the stormy Englishman. On the Gambia, in the quarters of the savages most vile, Down the lazy lotus waters of the mighty mystic Nile, Mark how English wealth is making a new highway for the earth And the iron arm is shaking the dead countries out of dearth! Through the tents of roaming Tartars and the houris without garters Rolls his ready capital, And our colours gleam and shiver in the sunshine of each river From the Seine to Senegal. On the rooftree's virgin summit of the world, in every clime, And below the deepest plummet in the ocean ooze and slime, Through the backwoods with the bearing of a God, at Ispahan, You will run against the swearing or the sweating Englishman. It's the energy and action in our universal race, Which have conquered fevered faction and the pestilence's place; And because they were not idle and disdained the coward's plea, Have imposed a bit and bridle on the tossing of the sea. These the mountain rock have tunneled and the furnace tamed and funneled And led captive with their tie, Which were bound to go on fighting for the good and for the righting And must ever do or die. Ah, the print of his heroic hand is written clear as Fate And endurance stern as stoic pride in loving and in hate, At the meeting of the nations, in the parliament or ban— Under all the tried foundations the imperial Englishman. With the sword and with the sceptre, by the conquests of the mind, He is foremost and adepter and a power that none can bind; In the commerce keen to travel and the thought that is athirst For more knowledge to unravel, he steps boldly forth and first. He may stumble or be straying into feasts instead of praying, When the season calls a fast; But if drunk at times or driven from the helm with bulwarks riven, He shall dominate at last. If behind the counter standing or in Senates passing laws, For his hold is the commanding and the crown, whate'er his flaws; He by nature is the singled One to work what mortal can, And of blood and iron mingled is the regnant Englishman. INDIA'S HEROES. Give me a pen of fire, And thought clothed in the thunder Of catholic desire That breaks men's hearts asunder; And then I shall not duly sing The deeds that through all ages ring Of heroes who made empire spring, And sowed their lives thereunder. For who can justly tell Of souls, the Grand Refiner Purged in a flaming hell, To issue thence diviner? Give me a fancy tipt With sunrise and its glory, And in the earthquake dipt Of battle grim and gory; And then I should but feebly write Of saintlinesses fair and white, And martyrs' patience infinite Crowned like some promontory. For fancy none nor pen Can paint, in hues that bound us, How gods once mixed with men— To show the Heaven around us. BUILDERS OF EMPIRE. Builders of Empire, makers of men, Terrible, tall, Girt with the glaive or mightier pen Governing all; Blood and the iron arm and environ You as our bulwarks, buttress and wall. Health to you, wealth to you, Riches and rank Not of the giving earth, or a living Often but blank. Kings may go down, but ye never fail— HAIL! Hewn of the granite, carving us fame Steadfast and strong Out of the thunder, out of the flame, Compassed with song. Ours is the glory, ours is the story Writ by your grand deeds, living and long. Grace to you, place to you Unto all time, Bright'ning the stages still of the ages Over each clime; Ye, that have conquered cross and the nail, HAIL! Drawing the future burden and bliss Into your sweep, Bridging the desert sand or abyss Curtained in sleep; Huge and heroic, saint or the stoic, Bridling the levin, bitting the deep! Power to you, dower to you, Passionate souls, Forging us beauties deathless of duties' Loftiest goals. Worlds set or sicken, ye do not ail; HAIL! Pillars of Church, columns of State, Yours is the hand Opening and shutting fortunes and fates, Worthy our land; Laying your measure, moulding at pleasure Laws and our lives by kingly command. Might to you, light to you Endless and large, Gathering praises yet as it raises Dawn without marge. Dynasties tremble, ye do not quail; HAIL! Builders of empire, makers of men Noble as ye, Guides of the globe in statesmanlike ken Forming it free; Greatly believing, greatly achieving Wonders that only œons shall see. Health to you, wealth to you Better than gold; Love of a nation, song's celebration, Thanks never old; Peoples may perish, ye never fail— HAIL! THE MODERN SOLDIER. In his pouch he carries fifty lives and more, Fifty lives of goodly men Ready for the reaping, when He requires their store. At a thousand paces And for wider spaces, He is sure to reach them with his rifle's bore. Terrible and true his aim, Lightning breath and winged death Bound to mangle or to maim; With his message driven through red tissues riven, Into ruin past reclaim. Not one soldier but a mighty host is he, Multiplied by demon skill To a dreadful murder-mill, Duly thus to be; Clothed with fear and lasting Havoc, grimly blasting All that faces him and will not hide or flee. Mere machine of killing force Flashing doom and damned gloom On our noontide's sunny source, Without pulse or pity for the soul or city Grinding his destructive course. TIME WAS. Time was, when England would not care To ask the safer road, But did whatever men could dare And bore her brother's load. She went her own imperial way, With justice at the helm; And sought not where the shelter lay, Or pickings from the realm. She doubted not it might be done, Nor cringed to powerful friends; But stept, with purpose straight and one, To her determined ends. But now she muddles here and there, Or meddles up and down; And, though her flag is everywhere, Not so is her renown. She counts her halfpence to put by, And guards the precious till; While hers is but the policy, To heap more money still. She watches for the rise and fall, Forgetting her dread dower; As if she were a market stall, And not a historied power. Time was, when prudence never made The measure of her act; She only did as duty bade, And kept with honour pact. For on a righteous law she leant, Which was in mercy laid; She said out boldly what she meant, And meant whate'er she said. She dwelt in day, and largely shaped The lowliest turn or tie; And courted simple truth, nor draped The profit with a lie. But now she is afraid to strike, A single honest blow; She waits on each event alike, And snaps at crumbs below. A timid foe, a false ally, She flouts her sacred call; Distrusted even in liberty, Despised by one and all. She wears the solemn mask of might, But sheathes a rusty blade; And though parading love of light, She shuffles in the shade. GOD BLESS OUR QUEEN. God bless our Queen with every gift, That makes a mighty nation; And yet to loftier heights uplift Her fame, on His foundation! And may the Bible as of old Sealed by the blood of martyrs, And not our glory or our gold, Be England's choice and charters. God bless the Church, and strengthen still With His own broader presage, Alike in good report and ill, Her true and holy message— And grant that she may carry light Mid darkest woe and welter, And offer all as common right A hospitable shelter. God bless the State, which firmly stands In freedom's ancient border, To be a witness through the lands Of Justice and its order. And let her not be idly bent By empty fears or faction. But above party government Rule with no sordid action. God bless us all, that every one Who calls this England Mother, May prove by daily kindness done He holds each man his brother! And thus we shall to others give The Peace, that is His pleasure; And keep the faith, whereby we live, Our solemn trust and treasure. THE POET'S SWAN SONG. This is the last song but not the past song Wrought by the Poet, made for the Masses, Breathing the salt sea, bringing the man's plea Broader than classes. Might of the mountains, sweep of the sky, Murmur of fountains asking reply Chanted by king Love, sweet as the ring dove Cooing thereby. Such is the Fate gift, such is the State gift Greeting far times, Rushing of storm wind, fragrance of old Ind, Mingling all chimes. “I on these lute strings ere they are mute strings, Strike as the Master only is able Music, to lead right parties that seek night, Worshipping fable. Open the porches out of the dark Bright as with torches, safe as an Ark, Showing me true things meant for a clue, things Whereto we hark. Follow the creed on, helping our need on Over a way Rugged with sharp flint, many a blood print— Ending in day. “Stand by the old Book, stand by the gold Book Giving us statutes of the Creator Fresh from Divine art, serve with a glad heart The Legislator. Gospels are many, Truth is but one Fairer than any, and for all done; Lifting to stature, full as God's Nature, Liberty's son. Hold to the pure Fact, rest on secure Fact, Written in Blood; Carry the Cross still, over the high hill, Over the flood. “Honour the best way, honour the blest way Trodden by brave men winning or trying, Crowned through grim pain, loving to get gain Though but by dying. Fashions are sorrow, eaten with blight; Work for the morrow and the new might Shed on the toilers, leaving the spoilers Passing delight. Thus shall ye draw yet, thus have as law yet Ocean's wild breath; And, whatso'er be, life would remain free— Victor of death.” IN HONOREM V.R.I. 20 JUNE, 1897. Best of wives and best of mothers, Best of women, Gracious Queen, Who hast made all men as brothers If with unity unseen; And conjoined in gentle nations Our divided populations, With no bar but love between! Honoured heart of royal nature, More than beautiful bright soul, Thou hast risen up to the stature Of a perfect self-control; And we bless thee and address thee, Proved alike in good and ill, Re-anointed, re-appointed Now with universal will. First of Ladies, in the shelter Of thy kindness we have grown, Through the shadow wild and welter, To find liberty our own; And thy life has been the measure Of our England's grandest treasure, And a truth till then unknown. Yes, with giant powers and paces We have leapt into the light, With its heritage of graces And the gift of godlike might; O thy rule has added splendour To our progress, by surrender For our weal of ancient right. Children, plucked from Moloch orgies In the cruel mine and mill, Scarred by blows or flaming forges Which upon them wreaked their fill, Hail affection and protection Clasping them as with a zone, And thy thirsty pity bursting Like a fountain from the Throne. And the wants of maid and matron Long unheard and long denied, Knew in thee a noble patron— One by sorrow not untried. Lo, they looked to thee in fateful Hours and won responses grateful, And their fetters were untied. Best of wives and best of mothers, Best of women, Gracious Queen; When we gat no help from others, Thy great mercy was our screen; To the castle, and the cottage With its humble mess of pottage, Thou hast ever faithful been. In the doom of fear or famine, When the statesman hurried by Or would fain at ease examine Figures, vast thy sympathy. Thou wast ready, with a steady Love that did not once deceive; Thy pure living, more than giving, Soothed when nothing could relieve. First of Ladies, with the sweetness Of thy sixty glorious years We have gained a rich completeness, For our triumphs and our tears; From the clear and calm endurance Of thy care, and its assurance Which the heart to heart endears. O the marvels and the magic Springing as beneath thy rod, With a balm for burdens tragic And a ladder up to God; When to souls condemned to sickness Healing came in hopeful quickness, And with science blessing trod! Pain was banished, time and distance Conquered by compelling thought, And the bounds that seemed resistance Were to soft subjection brought. Space was travelled, and unravelled Heaven its riddles yielded up; And the mortal, at its portal, Deeply drank nepenthe's cup. Bridled steam and bitted lightning Yoked thy chariot as it flew Over lands and waters, bright'ning Earth with miracles anew; While a fresh and fairer nation, Like some goodly young creation, Round the world a wonder grew. Best of wives and best of mothers, Best of women, Gracious Queen, Age with which oblivion smothers Lesser lights unfolds thy sheen; And its story shall wax greater Yet, with majesty sedater, And a central sun be seen. Live, when into the late darkness Thou hast stept victorious still, And thy hand assumes the starkness Of our common human ill! Live, in kindness, mid the blindness Which descends upon us all; And in pleasant fancies present, Reign when other sovereigns fall! Be remembered, not like sages By profoundness of wise arts, But as written on the pages Of a thousand thankful hearts; As the servant crowned and willing Of a people's choice, fulfilling But for them thy deathless parts. Not the iron wall of vessels Girdling us against our foes, Not the famous flag that wrestles Proudly with the thunder throes; Not the steel-tipt ranks of rifles Fronting dangers as if trifles, In a blood-red world of woes; Not the rule of righteous order Carried far in heathen night, Till it plants our peaceful border Up on murder's broken might; Not the science with defiance Of the stormy wind and wave, Onward bringing light and wringing Secrets from the very grave! None of these, although the strongest, Worthy records of thy sway; But that love, which wears the longest, Breathing from thy blessed way; And the life, by lofty pureness, Stretching forth with holy sureness To the broader better Day. ENGLAND'S FRONTIERS. Others may boast lines More scientific, Chosen and charted with painting and talk; But where the enemy, proud or pacific, Lies, are our coast lines— England's free walk. We know no map-stuff, Parchment or pap-stuff, We honour none; Only the frontiers ruled by our rifles, Wrung by the sword sway, Held in the Lord's way, When there are great deeds of history done And hearts feel hearts and they cease from their trifles. We bend to no man, Give us the foeman Thousands of miles from our shelter and shores, Armed to the teeth and with cannon that bristles Saucily guarding his jewels and stores; England is there, lads— England is where, lads, Rude strokes are falling and iron rain whistles Down the poor ruin of pasteboard and wrongs— Hammer and tongs. Others are tarriers, Weighing the peril Coldly with scales and an eye to the till, Doomed to a policy stupid and sterile; England no barriers Heeds, but her will. We have weighed anchor, While they but hanker Idly for gains; We are at blows, lads, and in the red middle Rolled by the battle, Careless of tattle, Bathed in the spatter of blood and of brains While they are dreaming of what they may fiddle. We often tread first, Plunging in head first Hitting our hardest before we have thought; Trying the metal of folks and their measure, With our good blades out of liberty wrought. England is willing— England, when killing Fails and the fun, likes to judge things at leisure; Only she must do her work her own way— Buffet and pray. Others their fingers Timid and fumbling Stretch to the prize that they gladly would steal, Then to draw back in hot haste with a humbling; England but lingers, Over her meal. We dropping flattery, Run out a battery Right to the front; Full on the spot, where the shrapnel is shrieking Murder and hell, lads, Pounding them well, lads. Such are our old island weapons and wont, Action that wins ere the fools have left speaking. We are for doing, Straight without wooing, Just what we fancy and picking the best; Be it a banquet or plucking a pigeon, Be it a world or a maiden's white breast. England is in it, England a minute Waits not, but strikes, and that is her religion. Yes, we are pious and proper and kneel— Bible and steel. Others a border Make of their own land, Trusting in fortress and fencing of might, Daring not venture away from the known land; England is order Always, and right. Look at her giant Vessels reliant, Ploughing the deep; Carving the earth which is pliant and plastic But to her moulding Touch and enfolding Arms of the iron and infinite sweep, Growing each day yet more grim and elastic. Force leaves its furrows Lasting, and burrows Down in the awful abysses of blue, Binding above and below with a fetter Both worlds to which it alone has the clue. England uncaring, lads, England unsparing lads, Fashions the globe as she passes the better. We keep our powder and bullet reply, Ready and dry. Others have truckled Tamely to fortune; These write no record to live on the main, Though the fair breezes to triumph importune; England was suckled Sternly on pain. Seas and their herring-pond Are her unerring pond, Curled at her feet; Where in her glory she sails, as in blindness Earthquakes might thunder, Treading all under (Foes in the path) as a native his street, Yet with the shout of a boisterous kindness. Here in her homely Element comely, Marshalling war-ships she rides on her way, Cursing, and blessing the Lord for the beauty Granted a Queen of imperial sway. England, in harness, lads, England by far ness, lads, And at the inshore would die for her duty. Only be sure she has, rather than think, Worship and drink. Others may toast lives Pretty on paper, Boundaries all that the feeble expects Cut by diplomacy's elegant caper— England such coast lines Calmly corrects. Laughing she nuzzles Close to the muzzles, Pointed by foes; Here is the frontier, here is the slaughter-mark Made by her cannon, If but one man on Ships that though shattered outlive the worst woes, Here is her single acknowledged high water mark. Winds and rough weather Comrades together Shake her and shape her to victory sure, Holding the treasures and loves we adore most And in the jaws of disaster secure. England must win, lads, England romps in, lads, And with a rush ever rides out the foremost. Give her her head, and full canvas to bear— Searoom to swear. A MODERN JUBILATE. Behold, they flock with multitudinous feet, The countries, even from earth's remotest marge, Empires and kingdoms and democracies And potentates and principalities, That lay aside their jealous doubts and meet At one broad table with the same high charge; To honour her, whom all Consent to crown with reverence as their own, The sovereign of the seas, The foremost Lady of the Land, Who never did an action mean or small But by her gentle charities is known, A ready listener to the lowliest pleas And servant of her servants' least command. O parliament of peoples Most visible, most vast, A hundred towers and stately steeples Remind you of the more heroic past; And from the shadow of their glorious graves Bring back the men of might Who built this England Queen of winds and waves Up to her goodly height. It is the greatness of the undying dead About you grandly in its splendour spread, And under captive nations The solid sure foundations, That to the living Establishes a firm and faithful pledge Of safety, on red revolution's edge With sheer sharp downward slopes; And grants forgiving In fair eternal hopes, For judgment blindness And calculated years of armed unkindness. Rejoice, that England is herself and strong For ruling yet, And has a sceptre infinite and long To reach the ills that God doth nigh forget; Which is indeed His dreadful Arm and draws, Though throned as stars in stations Above the range of common laws, Princes and populations Unto that awful Will Which brooks no rival still. Rejoice, that England in her freedom reigns, Serene and sole, And carries on her head the aureole Of destiny too large for other brows, And sways the righteous sword In battles for the Lord Which weakness tries to lift but only feigns, And keeps her plighted vows. She stands, nor at the hour delays to strike, Colossus-like On sea and continent, Dispensing round her liberties and charters And crowns and “garters” To those who win her favour, and the earth In desert wastes and wilds forgets its dearth, At her arbitrament. Her commerce is the life-blood of the lands, It carries with it plenitudes of wealth And prophecies of health Unknown, undreamed of at the morn Of leaves and ragged thorn, In better broader times to be; And broken bands That come with loftier works and ways Than all our yesterdays, And beateth out through justice and its light The music that makes slaves erect and free, Like noon and night; So sure and sweet her interchange of act And word, that as the seasons run Obedient to the sun And principle of God's great primal fact. Rejoice, that England's hold Falls on the helm Of progress, and is pioneer of things And guideth on by character, not gold, Each willing realm And vassal strength or State By paths predestinate And passionings, With tournaments of truth And friendly provocations To fuller powers and yet more splendid youth, By loving emulations. Rejoice, that our big world is vaster And comelier now for England's sake, Which is the master, With the imperial hand to make or break; And, once in history, crownèd Might Is Right. ROYAL—LOYAL. This is the song of the people Made without effort or art, Rung on the bells in the steeple, Told by a kingdom's great heart; Love of the right, Trust in their might Moving as one man, and bolder Shoulder to shoulder. This is the creed of the Loyal Tested by famine and flood, Faith in the heart that is royal More than the regal in blood; Love of the true Glory and due, Gained from no perishing charters But by the martyrs. This is the hope of the Nation Stablished in strength like the rock, Built upon the one foundation Proof against shadow and shock. Love of the Best, Christ Manifest— Whether in work or gun's rattle, Both their God's battle. ENGLAND. England, I cannot love thee more, And I would never love thee less; Truth is the bulwark of thy shore, Thy bases all are righteousness. O, on this glory nations lean, That lack the charters in thy hand; And nothing common or unclean Hath place or portion in our land, Mother of States and parliaments, What greater boon could country give; That grants the isles and continents, To breathe thy liberty and live? Thine honour is the peoples' trust, That in its awful shadow sleep; And, as thou doest what thou must, Thy judgments are a mighty deep. And from the greatness of the sea Thy pathway takes its tidal force, And rolls its grand resistless plea Along a predetermined course. Thy spacious law is noonday light, It drives out darkness and the wrong; And, as the mountains in its might, Stands round the kingdoms and is strong. England, I cannot love thee more, And I would never love thee less; Thou bearest, what none ever bore, The habit of sweet holiness. For justice in thy courts doth sit, To make their counsels broad and true; And deals, with purpose infinite, Alike to God and man their due. Thou art a champion of the right, Though this be but a lonely ledge; And always in the van wilt fight, For freedom and its sacred pledge. Thy rule is peace, thy breath is power To which all ranks and races bend; The whole world is thy dreadful dower, Shaped by thee to its destined end. Thy robe is empire, and thy state The majesty of dawning skies; And on thy shoulder, fair as fate, The burden of the future lies. Dare to be greater yet, and lift The earth on that eternal way; For thine is heaven, and in its gift The promise of the brighter day. SECTION III. Laughing Philosophy. THE MODERN OLYMPUS. O, ye elegant reviewers, with the very best of wine And the hands that dip in ewers all of crystal superfine, Do ye trifle with your sherry and the choicest of cigars While with Cato waxing merry over “merum” and guitars? Holy teachers love to skimp us and allow us little marge, But like gods upon Olympus ye are liberal and large; And we earthworms, humbly plodding in a labour often stern, Never dream ye may be nodding in your catholic concern; We look up to you with wonder in your golden-shadowed show, As ye launch the bolts of thunder on our little world below. There are exquisite fine ladies, who discourse of laws and loves On your thrones, and send to Hades our poor souls with white kid gloves. Are they goddesses like Venus or Minerva with her owl, Who so lightly step between us and soft vices as we prowl? Though we hear a breezy bustling when we sow our wildest oats, As of fragrant roseleaves rustling or of pretty petticoats. Yet the sound is sweet and crisper than of mortal milliners, With the educated whisper of Divine philosophers; And we follow, if ye spurn us, though as lambs to slaughter led, For we love the blue cothurnus and for it have freely bled. O, forgive us the transgression, if we kiss your dainty feet And repeat the indiscretion just because it is so sweet. THE LAST MAN. Bald as a vulture, Toothless and blind, See the result of the curse of our Culture— Progress of Science and marching of mind; All head and no body, All brain without sense, With a lip more suggestive of tea than of toddy, And an ear less for music than Greek root or tense! No fist and no muscle, No stomach, just nerves Shrinking in awe from the shade of a tussle, And a pitiful poacher on female preserves; Dogs in the gutter, Birds of the air, Snap at him, peck at him—thin bread and butter, Reason's delight and the ages' despair! Look at him hobbling Blear-eyed and blank, Back to the jelly-fish whence he came wobbling Down the dim times to a dignified rank; Scold at him, sparrows, Tramp on him, swine, And away with homunculus now as he narrows To mere cerebral tissue his glory Divine. IS IT PEACE? I asked a Frenchman, “Is it war or peace?” “It's peace of course,” he cried with laughing eyes, “Though still our flag has that confounded crease.” And then he built a dozen iron ships. I asked a German, “Is it war or peace?” “It's peace of course,” he wrote with ready pen, “If only France and her ally would cease.” And he enrolled a few more thousand men. I asked the Russian, “Is it war or peace?” “It's peace of course,” he frowned, “you cackling goose, I give it to the world in endless lease.” And then he let his bloody Cossacks loose. I asked the Briton, “Is it war or peace?” “It's peace, of course, the only cure for ills, Though I keep Egypt stewing in her grease. But Labouchere will have no butcher's bills.” If this be Peace, then war at any price— I tell my sweet pacific Quaker nieces— Beats armèd Peace and empty sacrifice; And Europe soon will be reduced to pieces. RATHER REVEREND. The Rather Reverend Peter Brown, Who was a rural Dean, Enjoyed a living in a town Like him not very lean— A country town, where people woke Up only once a week On market day, and dimly spoke As drowsy people speak, And sank to rest again and kept At bay each lively sound, And did their business as they slept Till Saturday came round; A place, where farmers one or two, Some dirty pigs at play, And none with anything to do, Composed a market day: Where, if you went into a shop By pressing duty nerved, The tradesmen seemed to need a prop And nodded as they served; Where, when you sadly needed change, No vendor could be wil'd, But only thought the question strange And feebly at you smil'd. The Rather Reverend Peter Brown Was somewhat sleepy too, And once put on his partner's gown— Which nobody should do— Instead of his own Oxford best, His beautiful M.A., Wherein his portly person drest Swept worldly things away— And thus paraded to the church, Before he marked the wrong Which left a lady in the lurch And spoiled his matin song. He had a round and ruddy face, A fat and feeling voice, And all he did demanded space— Indeed, he had no choice: His sentiments and body grew As he had richly sown, Of life he took a liberal view— If mainly for his own. He met with large opinions all And packed each larder shelf, Believed in God, filled sty and stall, Expanding still himself. The Rather Reverend Peter Brown Was greatly given to snuff, In spite of the conjugal frown And many a sharp rebuff; He took it boldly as he preached Before the Bishop's face, And out of doors until it reached Across the market-place; Where'er he went he left a track No testimony dim, And little boys behind his back Ran sneezing after him; He took it oft when'er he ate From dusty pockets deep— A ready witness was his plate, He took it in his sleep. And once, when he was duly bound On preaching for a friend, And to avoid the wind turned round Just for the usual end, He quite forgot again to turn In his ecstatic state, And travelled home and did not learn The error till too late. The Rather Reverend Peter Brown Invested in a horse, And threw a mint of money down Without the least remorse; But soon repenting of his deed And with a knowing air, He cantered off upon the steed And sold it at the Fair; Next morning merrily he came With crafty tone and touch, And bought once more the very same— For merely twice as much. It's said he trotted to a Meet— But not of hunting hounds— Where clergy people found it sweet, To sport on sacred grounds; But ere the others he would fain Pursue his homeward course, Yet could not tell with all his pain Which was the proper horse; So when an hour was sadly past And nothing further known, He humbly mounted on the last And hoped it was his own. The Rather Reverend Peter Brown Delighted much to sing Good loyal tunes, and took the Crown Beneath his ample wing; He played at politics and cards And somehow always won, He had a cousin in the Guards And coached Lord Acre's son; He hobnobbed with Sir Oyly Smith A knighted grocer man, And taught him how the solar myth To wild excesses ran; He went to London every year To clear his country mind, And found hotels were wondrous dear, But left his wife behind; He laid a fiver on his choice To win the Derby race, And wrapt in cotton wool his voice When in a doubtful place; He gave poor people soup and coal, And never hurt a friend Or enemy, and on the whole Was “Rather Reverend.” THE NEW CODE OF 1999. When the New Code of the ages, carefully evolved through stages Of more Aclands into pages of the most portentous length; Reached the climax of perfection by a process of selection Heedless of mere class objection, it attained a fearful strength; And My Lords who elevated England's youth and fulminated Their imperial laws, orated in proud rescripts without pause Comforts for the millions yearly coddled, and instructed clearly How to bleed Producers dearly with some fresh and leech-like clause. Every pupil had a teacher to himself who was a preacher Of strange gospels, and a reacher through all science and each art And unheard of pranks and passes loved by molecules and gases, Precious to the sovereign Masses and their rather costly heart; And he had as much of Learning or as little as his yearning Mind which never thought of earning for himself or others chose, And no tutor would (however scientifical and clever His certificates) endeavour to disturb one child's repose. Every pupil trained in “Do Fa” and the rest enjoyed a sofa. From the rates which had to go far now, and were a monstrous drain On the groaning squire and squarson and the casual fossil parson Left by taxes worse than arson in their greediness of gain; Yes, he had an arm-chair present and his own apartment pleasant— Far more spacious for the peasant than for any royal Prince— And a cheery stove the latest and the best, which gave the greatest Warmth and stood the awful State test, at which feebler stoves would wince. Every pupil had a servant waiting on him fond and fervent Just to help his harassed nerve, anticipating the least need, In the winter with hot water-bottles for his cosy quarter When the Influenza slaughter spared no person's cloth or creed; In the summer time with fanning to assuage the heat unmanning By a little pleasant planning, and in other welcome ways To make parishes more debtful, and insure him from the fretful Cares and flies that were forgetful or the sun's aggressive rays. Every pupil had his dinners free and paid for by the sinners Who were better off and winners of the wealth the State required, Not mere miserable pottage once a boon to boor and cottage But prime thumping steaks and what age quite as much as youth desired; Pudding too (and not by measure meted) at his utmost pleasure To sustain the priceless treasure as the standards' course went on, And all delicacies grateful to his palate by the plateful Even at lessons, no more hateful to the school phenomenon. Every pupil had the papers night and morning, and cut capers With the last new lamps and tapers, if his eyesight was not good; And though later he might grovel in some mean and grimy hovel, Yet at school could claim the novel which adjacent ever stood; And discussed each burning question whether sex or indigestion With a frank and broad suggestion and with all his learning pat, Never in the dullest season at a loss for some fit reason Why he played at cards or treason like a free Arithmocrat. Every pupil had the middle of his studies and each riddle Soothed by the delectant fiddle found by his paternal Board, And indulged in pure immersions and the elegant excursions With all kinds of dear diversions lavished from rich neighbours' hoard; While he patronized his betters and he multiplied the fetters Forged by statesmen turned to sweaters of a large imperial kind, And requited with rude chatter benefits that made him fatter In developing his matter at the cost of his small mind. Every pupil was a master and with progress moved the faster On in spite of such disaster as the overburdened Rates, Living on the milk and honey and expending still more money Ere he came to matrimony and the life that educates; Till Her Majesty's Inspector, now no more a paid detector Of abuses and dissector of the knowledge without shape, Grieving for his lost vocation and the sad abomination Of the general desolation, hanged himself in his Red Tape. PARENTS AT SCHOOL. As they please My petted darlings, who have got the upper hand, At their ease Recline on sofas, and make parents humbly stand; While they toy with bread and butter Or are trifling with the cake, And in languid accents utter Edicts, as if half awake. For not with my leave or by my leave they masterfully teach, And then use me (I acknowledge) as a not unwilling tool; Though I feel, to hear them gravely teach, O very much at school. As they like Since we have abdicated now the parents' throne, They can strike Or work five minutes at some easy text or tone; While we know that we are sitting At their feet in humble style, On the chance of just the flitting Of some sweet rebuke or smile. When I seem to be instructing, I am really learning yet How to be a docile father and a happy chick-pecked fool; For they won't allow me to forget I'm very much at school. To their will I love to hearken as a proper pupil would, And fulfil The duties patiently which those dear tyrants should; For if they show capriciousness, I would not care to miss The pink and gold deliciousness Consenting to a kiss. For I love my little master and I love my mistress well, If their lessons are not Acland's and their conduct may be cool; And they keep me, though they cannot spell, So very much at school. To the end I feel quite certain I shall ever be their slave, And not mend Their manners which might stir my grandsire in his grave; For my chains are wreathed with roses Of their blushing cheek and lip, And my studies are the poses When their footsteps turn or trip. At the mouths of babes and sucklings I am taught the bravest code, Who in penitence take kindly to the stupid dunce's stool, And delight in my own heart's abode While very much at school. VERB. SAT. SAP. Let Haeckel with his magisterial nod Which shows his small acumen, Deny the Being of his God (poor God!) And deify Albumen; He tells us Carbon is the source of all By wondrous combination, And snaps his fingers at mere Christ and Paul With Science's salvation. But how, I ask, did Carbon first combine And get those happy forces, Except from some great Mystery Divine Or hidden sacred sources! Give me the Great Unknown the awful X, The Plus of all and Spencer; And they may crown the meanest mollusc rex To make the darkness denser. Let grubby Camper set his fossil throne With brother fossils round him, On his pet intermaxillary bone— A Goethe can confound him. And let the os hyoides be the crux Or crust of dry contention, I humbly bow to the evolving Flux And slow but sure ascension; Let Darwin with his undecided nose But views of grand decision Find little room for God, whom seers disclose That bring the truer vision. Let sophists of the scientific kind Demur to praise or mention The One who is all works and laws behind, Or honour with a pension! I care not for collective wisdom's vow, Or drum whoe'er may thump it; I only see it falling ap'onou, At the first penny trumpet. And though Laplace did sweep through mighty space To find no Blessed Being, Yet that vast vision was His glorious Face, And all he lacked was seeing. The hand that holds the telescope is God's, If mortals mark but Tophet, Or poke among the gases and the clods Before the Veilèd Prophet. I know He is within me and without And bridges every chasm, Though pedants mock or pull his worlds about Or prate of protoplasm. And while from Him I could not, would not fly Nor from His moulding Fingers, The shadow of my far-off ancestry Yet on me darkly lingers. His heaven is Love, and there is burning hell In any evil action; But still the smallness of the parent shell, Bequeathes a tell-tale fraction. Yea, all the cries and passions of the Past, The reptile, brute, and savage, Toss in me like a surging sea upcast And long to rend and ravage. While all the pulses of a fairer morn And worlds no words can utter, The formless plumes of beauties yet unborn Deep in my bosom flutter. THE NEW SCHOOL OF MANNERS. Place for children now, ye parents, take the lowest seat; Be content, if ye have nothing but your house-room and your clothing, And enough to eat. Be upon your best behaviour, To attention stand, humbly hat in hand, For the child is now the paviour Of the awful path of Progress, and the only modern saviour For this blessed Land! Things are changing fast, and all (dogs and masters) rise and fall. We shall doubtless get accustomed soon to any change, Even if the nails drive hammers and we turn again to grammars Or to pastures strange; Now the bit is reckoned vaster Than the blooming whole, and the body soul, While the prize is to the faster Not the better man or braver, and the pupil is the master And the start the goal. Servants reign and children rule, and the parents go to school. Place for children now, old fogies, be prepared to wait; Walk behind your little tyrants, and obey these young aspirants Who control the state! Calm as Herakles they throttle Every serpent ill, palsied by their will; The triumphant bib and bottle Coming to the front and wiser far than any Aristotle, Though we pay the bill. Ah, they spend whate'er we earn, and we daily live and learn. We have ceased to raise objections and are glad to serve, Though like Englishmen we grumble when our masters chance to stumble On a toe or nerve; Now that chidhood wears the breeches, We abide at home and dislike to roam, While we put protective stitches In small garments torn and draggled by the hedges and the ditches And adhesive loam. When old childhood brings us pain, they will go to school again. Place for children now, instructors, let them have their fling, Let them have a trifle more ease, juniores sunt priores, And the Babe is King; Let the spirits turn the tables, Just a little while with transparent guile; We are living modern fables, And the steed is in the saddle and the rider in the stables Till it does its mile; And the parents will be free, if they only live to see. THE BIG POT OF SOCIALISM. “La Propriété, c'est le vol.” Let us be logical, sir, if you please, Let us be logical first, Calmly discussing the case at our ease Just with a rational thirst. You are a Socialist, sir—very good; I may observe, I am not; Property, land with its corn and its wood, Money and honey and all that you could, Whether you ought not or whether you should, Palace and labourer's plot, Served up with ignorance hot— All that for ages has privately stood, Proof against Radical shot— Even the Monk, I suppose with his hood— You would pitch into the Pot. In they go tumbling—O, let us commence, None of your shabby reserves or pretence, Only be logical now— Vestals with virginal brow, Dives in purple with pickings immense, Hodge with his acres and cow; Sinners and saints and the Gentile and Jew, All must souse into the General Stew, None must have luxuries, down with the beer! While one poor brother is starved, Cut up the capons, distribute the cheer— What if the landlord is carved? Castle and cottage both mix in the pottage, Hovel in ruins and Hall, Wise men like Platos and tiny potatoes— Plenty of room for them all. Kindly remember that nothing is left, Nothing to claim as your own; Every possession is simply a theft, If it may still be unknown; Taken perhaps by some rascally Lord Ages ago against right, When there existed no rule but the sword And the one tenure was Might. Empty your pockets of treasures and purse, Watch and the trinkets of gold; Do not forget selfish hoards are a curse, Even if centuries old! Never suppose you can chalk off a line Really Protection by name, Though you may choose to demur and repine— Manfully play out the game. Yes, your dear labours as well as your neighbour's, Product of brain or the hand, Equally grateful a pan or a plateful Yield to the public demand. Make no exceptions of jewels or clay— Nothing—howe'er it be got; No “moral minimum,” no private pay Rises from national rot. Now for your clothing—be logical, pray— Keep not one leprosy spot; Strip like a man in the primitive way, Breeches and all in the Pot! Do have the courage, I beg, of your creed Blazoned in glorious crudity, Proved to the hilt by your personal need; Who cares for trifles like nudity? Spare not a rag of your wardrobe, be true, Sir, to your principles yet; Grudge not the General Fund what is due, Cast in your poodle or pet; In with your pudding and in with your parson, In with your penny or pound, In with your patriot playing at arson Though in the holiest bound. Let us be logical. In goes the vice, Long so indulged in and hugged; Be a brave Socialist, down with the price— If it's your grandmother jugged. Yes, that reminds me, relations are nought; Ties are obstructions that block, Family fetters have merely been wrought Just to replenish the Stock. Children—of course, they belong to the State, Sentiment goes to the wall; Ah, and the helpmeet misjoined to your fate, Now belongs freely to all! Mine, sir, if thine, and poor tumble-down Dick Claims with connubial band Her to whom you would so jealously stick— Married is she to the Land! Married to Matthew and married to Mark, Married to Peter and Paul, Married to men of the light and the dark Married (God bless her!) to all! Those precious darlings too curled and too kissed, Daintily gartered and gowned, Now will receive (what they fain would have missed) Tubbing and scrubbing right round. O, and your Baby (which follows the Purse) Each will with emulous wits Handle and dandle, and awfully nurse Out of its senses to fits. Each of us now will be welcome to brush Each of your treasures at will, Or if we like with a whipping to hush Each little lacrymal rill. They will be combed and corrected and led Nightly to each little stall, Comforted, physicked, instructed and fed Everywhere ever by all. Hope not by subterfuge yet to defy us, Think not from duty to swerve, Playing the part of a false Ananias Keeping a sop in reserve; Holding a tit bit away from the Store, Lips or delights of the shelf, Something to guzzle alone or adore— Kisses or cakes for yourself! Near ones and dear ones, the choicest and chief, Those of the tenderest lot, Those who partook of your gladness or grief, All are condemned to the Pot. Private taps too you say now are forbidden, Into one Tap they are thrown; How then can you retain ever unchidden. One rosy mouth as your own? All fingers poke in one general pie, All are the Hydra-like head, All are the tail and all brotherly lie Snoring in one blessed bed. All eat from one and the same precious plate, All drink of one common mug, All are both governed and governing State, All share the parson and pug. Make no objections or idle corrections, Let us be logical, do; Persons and chattels, though twopenny rattles, Droned by the devil knows who— Each whether peg or propriety dress, Plumps as a part in your catholic mess. We are advancing—it's well—with the times, Taking together our ills, Cant, influenza, our churches and chimes, Beggaring neighbours by legalized crimes— Aye, and political pills; Now let's apportion the bills; Nothing is sacred in reason or rhymes, All must partake of all tills. We are returning to early old founts, Civilized backward again; Savage simplicity here only counts, As the Great People ordain. Why, my good sir, have you sacrificed friends, Liberty, justice and pride, Each to your conscience and Socialist ends— You yet remaining outside? Let us be logical, let us be fair Always to Truth and its kin; Muse on the happy regenerate air, When you are boiling within. Think of your bed-fellows in the same Stew, Honesty, honour and love, Empire and Union and faith, with the new Devilry dancing above; Bess of the brothel and Sal of the slum Shouldering Bishop and Peer, Scrapings of gutter and crossing and scum Reeking of skittles and beer. O, it's a wondrous receptacle—this, Great with class-levelling greed, Grandly capacious and like the Abyss; Here's a “solution” indeed. All things are solved or dissolved—it is one, All folks are equal and free, Subjects are sovereigns and all work is done Jointly and all disagree. Bless the Big Pot which contains lean and fat, Capital, labour and Grace With the last century hit off his bat, And for the Crofter finds place. Stir it and feed it with fuel till hot, Properly heated right through; Throw in our Royalty too, Playing decorum or loo, Welshman and German and Paddy and Scot, Millionaire's mansion and penury's cot; Then take a header yourself in the Pot— I, my dear sir, after you. Life may be broken—not theories bend, Let us be logical still to the end. CAPTAIN MARY JONES (S. A.) Captain Mary Jones Listed in the Army with the tambourine and bones; Just because she felt a call And a process of conviction, Like a ramming home of damning To a sinner, as she told us sinners one and all. Then chock-full of benediction, Colours blowing, overflowing, Souse into the slums she went And held on; Pale and sweetly penitent, While the halo of her goodness grew and round her shone. Captain Mary Jones Pleaded with the masses, in the most persuasive tones; Getting grace she laid it thick Like the very best of butter, With an unction and compunction For unhapy souls in night who had not learnt the trick; O, she raked the stews and gutter, Of the creepings and the sweepings And the refuse and the dregs. She was game, Nor regarded rotten eggs, With her silky hair and saucy figure and proud name. Captain Mary Jones Preached salvation free and full, with palms and crowns and thrones; She was great at doctrine sound And the rapture of endurance, Though the arrow first might harrow Hearts obdurate, ere the Rock and remedy were found. And she promised you assurance True and tender, on surrender Of the vilest to the Lord; She fought well, And the Bible was her sword— Ah, she fluttered the old Devil down in darkest hell. Captain Mary Jones Faced a mob, and imprecations worse than sticks and stones; And she gave them brimstone hot Or the comforts of conversion, Speaking plainly and not vainly; Till she button-holed the bully and awoke the sot, And the unclean asked immersion In the river, to deliver Flesh from all the filthy smears And the curse. She was beautiful at tears, And the rogue when born again accepted her wetnurse. Captain Mary Jones Slap-dash made for Kingdom-Come, when clerics thought of nones; Knocking down like ninepins all Godless creatures, rake and rambler, With her pretty eyes and jetty Lashes long, and artless accents, in one blessed fall. Death she was to any gambler, With his horses and ill courses, If he ever barred the way— Down he flopt! And she only paused to pray, Till the rescued wretch by Scripture had been underpropt. Captain Mary Jones Spared no social evil, and attacked the gilded zones; Caught a Duke, who follows yet Humbly after her wild bonnet, While he draggles on and waggles Proudly in the dirt beneath her his great coronet— Aye, he dances now upon it! And the Duchess asks, if such is Just the single saving road— Through the slums; And would drop her jewelled load, If she could but stand the dowdy dress and kettledrums Captain Mary Jones Hustled out to judgment light, the sins the world condones; Dragged them shivering from the shade Into Gospel sunshine, vices Patched and painted and half sainted By the mummery of Fashion and its Masquerade. Other women had their prices, This one money, that one honey, But she never could be bought— Never was on sale; For the Master still she fought, Hawked not up and down the Marriage Market as a bale. Captain Mary Jones Rose to rank and credit, by the tambourine and bones; None could give an honest bang Like her method and its powder With such muscle, or could bustle Sinners out of Darkness with her soul-compelling slang; If they lingered, she waxed louder With a wrestling and a pestling Of harmonious lips and hands, And heart-thirst; For her preachments were commands, And she bundled them right into Heaven and all head first. BROTHER BATHOS. Brother Bathos— This will tell you how he figured, how he fared Up and down the golden city; How he wept aloud for sin, and sweetly cared For our modern Babylon; With his pathos, With his mathos And an unctuous power of pity— Oozing his Eirenicon. He believed in talk and tears, In the fission Or the shaking And awaking Of the hearts that passion sears, In the glory of a well-conducted mission. Here he truly romped and revelled In a proper sort of way Over hostile doubts and fears, With discourses nicely “devilled” And appeals to mortal clay. Ah, his voice was like a rousing funeral hymn's tone, When he wrestled with the lusts In the agitated busts Of his audient virginity And attentive femininity— Or laid on the fire and brimstone. Brother Bathos— Thus they called him, friends and enemies as well, From his love of fraternising With the worshippers who followed his church bell, In our fallen Babylon; With his pathos, With his mathos In insidious modes surprising, Out of his great Organon. He rejoiced in every tool, From the flotage Of the ages And the sages Or the saints of any school, And he voyaged on a sea of anecdotage. Artless frumps and ancient fogeys Bowed before him, as the reed Swaying in a wind-swept pool, At the venerable Bogeys Of his dew-and-thunder creed. With convincing mop he stirred the suds and sediment Down in the old Adam rock 'Neath some unregenerate frock, Like another sorcerous Elymas, To an abject state of jelly-mass— Till he broke through all impediment. Brother Bathos Was a prophet of a certain sort and size, And uncertain years and temper; Nor had spidery spinster yet achieved the prize, Still on sale in Babylon With his pathos, With his mathos And those serious views ut semper— Of the Pope and Parthenon. Sometimes he would almost burst With his visions, And the story Of the glory Gained in sloughing flesh accurst— Orthodoxy hung upon his sound decisions. O his edicts shook the cloister And the licence of the camp, As no other preacher durst, And made eyes of angels moister With the sternness of their stamp. He was nothing if not absolutely clerical, In his garments and the grace Of the fat and foolish space, Occupied by his rotundity And its bottomless profundity Trading upon qualms hysterical. Brother Bathos Had a talent for unfolding Scripture truth, And most tenderly expounded Solemn mysteries to yearning eyes and youth, Mid the snares of Babylon; With a pathos, With a mathos Which conclusively confounded All the errors built upon. He was with his holy guiles Great at unction, And in cassock Or on hassock Manufactured tears and smiles, Which he shed on all without the least compunction. But he doted on sweet sinners Of the devious foot and glance, And ensnared them with soft wiles, Cups of tea and dainty dinners Or a casual country dance. But they proved him very nice and more than lenient In the penance on them laid, On the matron or the maid; Help they found, who chose to titillate Ready ears, and (should they sit till late) Arms for fainting forms convenient. CAVE CANEM. I hear it now— O, Cave Canem, The Cerberus that asks for sops Of blood and fire—in warning drops, Ere the great heavens in thunder bow And belch their bolts, the cry of Panem (That sheathes old enses) And the Circenses! Fate's warhounds still may wear a muzzle, And whine and whimper in their chain Which yet is yielding to the strain, And take the catlap From Dives' fat lap; But they alone can solve the puzzle, And some day in their slavering jaws Will mumble monarchs and their laws, And pick the bones Or tear the warm and quivering flesh From bloated bodies full and fresh, Of tumbled States and toppled Thrones. Awake, ye peoples, Downtrodden sore through ghastly years Of impotence and fumbling fears, By kings and priests and perjured statesmen, And lay the steeples Or hoary towers Of ill-got powers Flush with the kennel—ye are Fate's men! Red revolution is about— It's in the air, and on the threshold And at the door and faintly knocking, Nor will it long be kept without By mouldy bars and musty blocking— And Death has woven its awful mesh-hold. It mocks at ancient bounds precarious, And clearer looms From cruel glooms— God's retiarius. I hear the dreadful white lips mutter, Low in the caverns at their forges And drunken orgies, The final sentence; And soon the trumpet blast will stutter The message mixed With doom and fixed, Past praying and beyond repentance. THE ASTRAL PLANE. Don't say this is the heavenly land, The final goal to Man for ever Of happy thought, and high endeavour To find a basis where to stand; Don't tell me, what around environs My view, is hell-without gridirons, And all the precious tools to brand. Too bad for Heaven, too good for hell, With pleasant sounds if not like Simms' tone; It has not even the proper smell, Nor just the faintest breath of brimstone. It can't be Tophet or Gehenna, Or (what is worse) our own Vienna; It can't be Calvin's blissful bound, Or Hebrew Sheol or Greek Hades— For I can see no nice old ladies, Who deemed salvation to be sound. I'm sorely puzzled at the sight, And whether under this or that sky I waver between day and night— But here (good luck) is the Blavatsky! “Dear Madam, is it bliss or bane?” “You d—d fool, it's the Astral Plane.” GOÜN TO THE DAWGS. There is Jerry round the carner With his sassages and horl, And the Ragmon and his garner— For they pickuns beant smorl. Thar's the Dorkter with his coffin That he fills with payritch boans, Which I reckins is as offin As them wants to lay the stoans. Them is horl for milk and 'unny And more vittuls and fine tawgs, While it's munny, munny, munny— Hus be goün to the dawgs. Thar's the Parson with his texties, Which be good enough for moast; But his first, whate'er the next is, Be the best of buttered toast. And the Kewrut e's a korshun Not unlike the Fatted Karf, And 'e gets a looshus porshun While hus oanly has the charf. O, the gayum might still be funny If hus lived as some on frawgs, But its munny, munny, munny— Hus be goün to the dawgs. Thar's the landlord, and the new uns Aint no better nor the ould, With their scrapuns and their screwuns And their everlastun hould; Orl a bleedun yer on pay day Just with nuthun else to do, As if arth had lost its May-day In black winter through and through. Aye, thar's nort now sweet and sunny And no ile about the cawgs, For it's munny, munny, munny— Hus be goün to the dawgs. And the Boss 'e tries his squeedges, For 'e mun be mayster still; And the mon would riz the weedges, With a 'and uporn the Till. So between 'em boath they throttul Hour pore Trade till it be broak, And hus keep the empty bottul While the Torkers 'as the soak. If un poach a 'are or bunny, It means rollun prison lawgs; For it's munny, munny, munny— Hus be goün to the dawgs. Ah, they sez as orl be brothers, And jist eekals befoor Gawd; But the Lor, it cooms and mothers Hus and fathers with the rawd. It's palaver and fine wishus For the bearer of the blarst, While the foremost grabs the dishus And the Divil grabs the larst. So yer sees our lot, my sonny, Be a wusser nor the hawgs; For it's munny, munny, munny— Hus be goün to the Dawgs. QUEER STREET. I strolled at random down the street called Queer, And watched the tenants at their occupations Or gravitations— Though these were mainly Beer. They seemed but careless folks and jolly, Given up to idle ways and useless things Or works of folly, And some were tied to pretty apron strings. Both sexes there and every age and class Disported as they chose And clinked the frequent glass, Or kissed their neighbours' maids beneath the rose. All were in trouble, Which they invoked with quite religious claims And rendered double By suicidal aims. All were at sixes and at sevens, Unless they played at fives, And had their own peculiar hells and heavens But not their proper wives; They lived on borrowed money Which they would rather die than pay, Or buzzed about the alien honey Which tempted them to stumble more and stray. None looked before and none behind, They found the present Enough and beautiful and pleasant, And in the passing moment were confined. From hand to mouth they lived, and tarried For no wise future or good end Or the matured and mellow fruit; But simply loved to splash and spend, And without service and fair suit Were married and unmarried, And doddered down the same sad courses With wine and women, hounds and horses, Wrecked now by shadow, now by shoal And every day with fresh divorces, Unto the fated goal. They never thought And drowned their many cares in drink, Were vainly sold and vainly bought And dreamed not of the least production, Excepting their own self-destruction, But toppled over the wild brink; By mocking loves and meteor lights illumed, Consuming and consumed. Not one was serious, few were sane, And all Turned with each breath of Fashion's weather vane, They cared not to what dreadful issue of time and tissue, To the last curtain's fall. IRONY OF THINGS. What makes the kitten hunt her shadow And cheats the poet with his dream, Or paints the moonbeam on the meadow To mock the lover by its gleam? Why does the deed by fine confusion Think right will thus redeem its own, Or sages merely seek delusion And sacrifice to the Unknown? The world for ever like the kitten Pursues but phantoms to its fall, And irony (wrought out or written) Still reigneth at the heart of all. What bids the hound yet hug and follow The master strings as though it led, And woman find a comfort hollow In bliss that only drapes the dead? Why are we tricked by cold reflection, Who with our fingers bait the trap Of sordid gain or false affection, Which cannot hide the grave-like gap? Earth, like a hound upon its questing Mistakes for power the captive strings, And heeds not in the march unresting The mockery at the core of things. What dupes with lies the dazzled reason Until it deems we really live, When nought is true but shame and treason And death our grand prerogative? Why do we plough a barren furrow Or gather fruit of bitter wombs, And harvest loss or sin, and burrow In mines to be our golden tombs? We build for that which cometh after, And with our blood cement its gate; Divine and dreadful is the Laughter, Which guides us to a common fate. What makes us war for toys and trifles To reap but sterile tears and stains, And consecrate the Christian rifles Which blow out Christian lives and brains? Why must we toil in vain for others Who lightly squander wealth of years, And worship with a smile that smothers But cannot kill our mortal fears? Faith is a figment of intrusion, Which sends no satisfying feast; We feed on wind, and by illusion God rules and governs man and beast. THE SKELETONS' DANCE. Brother Skeletons, rise and no longer be dull, Give a thump to the thorax, a scrape to the skull; Don't be stupid and awkward, it's not a low trick, I'm the Sexton who used with the spade and the pick Once to do the last offices neatly for all, At a modest expense and at every man's call, Peer or pauper—I cared not, nor offered to strike For more wages, as some folks—I served you alike. And now shake off the dust, with its dolorous brand; Come up, Barebones And Sparebones, The Lord is at hand. Ha! the trumpet rings out with a terrible blast And the Angel of Doom has awakened at last, With a critical eye to the cut of your ribs And a hand that goes down like a hammer on fibs; For you cannot deceive him, he tells to a joint Just the place of each toe and he misses no point; And I'm ready to jog him and aid at a pinch, Who have measured you down to the uttermost inch; He will suffer no mixing of fancies or ends, If your digits Are Bridget's Or some other good friend's. Step out, skeletons, fast from your graves and the soil Which has coated you thus as its portion and spoil; We must celebrate somehow, at least with a Dance, This surprising event which is more than romance And (I take it) right welcome to sinner and saint, Though we most of us ask for a daubing of paint; And we seem fairly fit on the whole, in a lump, Save your servant who cannot get rid of his hump; Age has left you too withered and sombre and sere, Sister Slybones And Drybones— Resurrection is here. We feel awkward and stiffer than folks would desire, In a dazzle of daylight and fusty attire; But the worms have made free with our houses of flesh And the heartiest need all a-building afresh, A re-clothing and padding to fill in the cracks And some substance and warmth on our bosoms and backs. Aye, a cartload of hay, not a miserly dole, Would be splendid and warm, and stop many a hole. Come, os coccyx, patella, though brown as the Nile Or the Ganges, Phalanges, Hurry up with a smile. Yes, away with the clammy dead mould, look alive; For the fiddlers are marching, and you must revive. Here's a clout for you, Harry, to rouse you and raise Those poor sticks to the style of appropriate praise; There's a cuff to you, Charlie, with one foot in earth And no visage adapted for singing or mirth; I have orders to get you prepared for the show, When the Lord (who is gracious) descends to my row; So be ready to kick off the cumbering clay, Bully Mawbones, And Jawbones If toothless be gay. Right leg foremost and steady, stretch out with a will, And keep time and together with me and my drill; I am Sexton and buried you each, and I know How you fitted and paired before shovelled below. Dear old neighbours, attend to the tune and be smart, And not off in your shuffle or out in your part. It is like hoeing turnips, as you boys have seen, To divide this grand fuddle and find space between. Come, the game is not settled and hardly begun; Here's the Doctor, As Proctor, Who provided my fun. Merry meeting to you, sir, the Powers ordain— Aye, and here you're at home with your patients again, For it is chiefly your work and most came from your shop, Taken down by the Science you used as a sop; While you finished them neatly with beautiful fits, And then trundled them off for dissection in bits; Whence I learnt all the names of the blooming old parts, And a taste of your tricks in the surgical arts. For I was not a bungler or lazy or blind, Doctor Sawbones, Like Rawbones Your assistant behind! Don't you see him? Hook on, you can lighten the task. And correct my mistakes—it is little to ask— With a name here and there and a caution or knock, If I get them confused or we end in a block. We were partners in spoils and had many a spree Above ground and below, we had sense to agree; Fellow rogues should not quarrel; you dosed them, and I Had a harvest of blunders, because they would die; Kill and cure was your motto, a fine one for trade; Ah, your bleeding Was weeding And food for the spade. Ah, if Somebody sounds the reveillée again And you folks are not out, He will surely complain; So a truce to your squabbles and patch up your strife, And though grubby and mouldy aroused to new life Flock in numbers and welcome the call, grey or green, White or yellow, and sketches of what you have been. Never mind your complexion, don't stick at the hue, Let me sort you and size you—posssssing the clue. You old hussy, who stink now as ever you stank! Come, that nigh bone Is thigh bone Of Betty who drank: It's not yours, put it down, take your own proper crutch, And get clear of her quarters—you're in the wrong hutch; For she has not the sweetest of tempers, you know, And is hasty and spiteful, a word and a blow; She can hit pretty hard, as your cranium tells, And of brandy (good Lord!) even here how she smells! It is pitiful work, all this dawdling and fuss, With a muddle of tibia, cervix and crus; If you are not more speedy, I must use the stick; From your furrows And burrows, Pop as rabbits—be quick. Brother Skeletons, this is a jollier chime Than the tune when we met last at burying time, While the church bell was tolling and tears were the thing With the Parson half drunk and mad George as our king; You were mum then as mice and had nothing to speak, Not a curse in your larynx or ghost of a squeak. D?n that humerus there! It's your brother's, my man, Who was drowned in his beer though so well he began, With a voice in the Choir and the singing to do Like a trombone: Not, Tom, bone The baggage for you. I see changes about but forget not this hoard And my duty, whatever the luck be abroad, Or the shifting of landmarks—I spy the big yew Where I planted Black Bill, who was always a screw. Ah, and there he goes hobbling, as rusty as then With no manners and scarcely the weakness of men. Stop a moment, you thief, you are getting too mixed With the butcher and must be directly unfixed; You had never a sacrum like this, though you sat On the labours Of neighbours, And flourished thereat. Ho, the ladies are foremost and powdered and spry, If with only the dust—I feel horribly dry, And would give for a pint my few lingering “pegs,” Just to stand a bit steady and trim on my legs. Why, God bless me! I have the dear baker's left shin, Quite an inch or two short and all shabby and thin. Am I dreaming? I heard the last Trump sound a close, If it weren't the new Vicar at play with his nose, Or the Curate who thinks God is deaf with his talk, But is Leanbones And Meanbones On a Puritan stalk. Nay, it's right—they are risen and skulking from me, The cussed beggars who grudged me that moderate fee; When I scooped out their quarters and scamped not the toil, Though the winter might freeze me or summer would boil, And dug deeply and widely and filched from their sires Or the future a space for the largest desires, And then tucked them up warmly and turfed them in fast In their beds and at peace, to be cheated at last. You shall pay me now, robbers, or rest here and stink With cracked Kensit— But when's it, Boys, coming to drink? That looks better, good people—yes, bustle about, Choose your own and choose all—mind, no dancing without! But of course it is hard work and thankless at first, And like me you are drowsy and cramped and athirst. Where's that ulna, poor Bob, that would set you up right, Which you dropped in the scrummage of Waterloo fight? Go and fetch it—'twas fought in next parish—and run While you can, ere the business has really begun. Now the Quality come, and they answer my call; Hitch on, Tallbones And Smallbones— My respects to you all. It's the Squire, not so lusty in these narrow bounds As when booted and spurred he rode after the hounds, In his red coat on Polly of whom he was vain, Though she threw him at length and he rose not again. Sir, I wish you long life and all blessings and sport With the gun and the rod—I remember your port, Sir, and tasted it still through those famishing years— I'll be pleased, if God will, to wipe off the arrears. But excuse me, sir, please—that belongs to the law, That incisor And eyesore— He was mighty of jaw. Sister Skeletons, hug me, and babies and boys; All the trouble has fled, and there's nothing but toys; Though your eyes are mere sockets—you had not a choice— And the rasping of files is more soft than your voice. We want friction and use and the polish of Time, To bring back the dead music and murmurous chime; And by rubbing together we must grow more fair, With superior gloss and an elegant air. Lo, I see shaping out from her shadowy nook Pretty Shybones And Sprybones, My sweetheart the cook. Don't you mind in that kitchen, the Parson's, my dear, How with kisses we drank out the old dying year While we drank in the new and were merry and that, Though you married another and dropt me—you cat! But I'm not unforgiving, shake hands, and have me As a partner in frolicking, now you are free; Let the past be the past, while the present is ours; Resurrection is here, with new promise and powers, Come up, costa and vertebra, bravely step on: And, you omen, Abdomen With viscera gone. Let us skip till we rattle, and skip till we drop, Since old death has departed and life is our prop; For the graves are quite empty and pining with lack, While our joints that want tallow keep groaning and crack; They'll be supple and limber before we cry stay, When the oil that we long for is wafted our way. Make your postures, my children, as grateful as love For the Mercy that lifts you from darkness above, Or my staff will show how with a heavier stripe; Smoker Bluebones And Truebones, Come, lend me a pipe. You are fools, and at sixes and sevens in lots, That I can't disentangle in time from their knots; And despite my instructions and acting the nurse, It's confusion confounded twice over and worse. There is Jack running off with the femur of Dick, And the Devil alone can have taught him the trick; There's Betty with 'Lizabeth's uterus on, And young Joe is a patchwork of Peter and John. But, alack, I'm not me—it's your headpiece, Abe Strong; I have huddled, And muddled My skeletons wrong. Hullo, Parson, I'm seeking my head—you have mine, O, you reverend rascal, so fond of your wine And tobacco and gossip—I know you as well As you did the Squire's dinner and sound of his bell; Give it back then, and softly—don't swear as of old, With the worms on your axis and mouth full of mould; Come, no nonsense—I'm monarch here, this is my patch, And I'll hold it against even hell and “Old Scratch.” What, you fight me? Take that from the shovel and see, Master Beerbones And Queerbones, You've a master in me. But, my God, do have pity! Who's rising up now, Rib on rib, piece by piece, with a thunderous brow; Though I packed her in quicklime and dumped a huge stone On her temper and trusted she'd leave me alone? It is Nancy, my wife, and she's grown to her knob, Though she borrows from neighbours to hasten the job; And she's looking this way and like broomsticks and knives, Or a hundred cross cats with a hundred cross lives. Let me slip in my grave, it is quiet at least. She's the image Of scrimmage, And will find them a feast. AN EGOTIST. There are some things I value most, A pretty girl, a pipe, a ghost, A lily on the lea, A legacy, a crimson kiss, White arms that make a bower of bliss, A cottage by the sea. There are some things I value most, A lawyer's letter by the post— With nothing in the bank, A walk with Una and the stars, The pick of neighbours' best cigars, An evening's fun with Frank. There are some things I value most, A haunch of venison hot and roast For which I never paid, A vote, a Punch-and-Judy show, A jest, clear soup, a quiet row With Undine's tender aid. There are some things I value most, A yachting trip along the coast At some dear man's expense, A play, a cousin in the Guards, A lucky chance to cheat at cards, A passion if intense. There are some things I value most, A salmon steak, a hearty toast Of beauty's lips or legs, A ballet queen, a Dresden jug, A royal Prince, a clever pug, That (like a parson) begs. There are some things I value most, A billet doux, good beer, a host Who gives his treasure stored, A nap in Church, a borrowed silk Umbrella, rich relations, milk By human kindness poured. There are some things I value most, A horse whereon to bet and boast, A woman going straight, A moor where grouse are sometimes killed, A golden goose, a hamper filled With precious Christmas freight. There are some things I value most, Beyond the fruits of vat and oast, A little honest pelf From maiden aunts and wealthy friends Who drop their coin like candle ends— But above all myself. BIDDY. Painted Biddy Was a most distracting widdy, Who had served in many schools And was trying Ere she turned to thoughts of dying How to sit upon two stools; And to make the best and utmost Of both worlds, with wide maternity; Not by any chance to miss Those hot pleasures, which abut most On this side of the Abyss In eternity. O her unconfounded face Was a beacon and a landmark, Blazing like a warming-pan Or a copper kitchen-can, Till it left each haunted place Dry and dusty with the sand-mark Of an ever ebbing sea. She was mighty too at tea, And her tattle Spared not any Of the many, When she sniffed from far the battle, And disdained the orphan's plea. Like a pestilence she travelled Up and down, at Devil's tasks, With a dozen different masks Lean and louring And devouring All who came within her reach And remained to hear her preach Of the plots she had unravelled. Woe to even the bravest parson, When upon the wartrack keen Biddy breathing death and arson Was to his confusion seen! Soon he felt he was post-dated, Scalped and scotched, eviscerated By her blarney; While the widdy snuffed and snorted, Till he wished himself transported (If she only came not thither) Anywhither— To Killarney. She was equal to the best, And no lawyer Or top-sawyer Was her match, as all confest. Yet she loved the stole and cassock In her way, And kept clean and nigh a hassock Of a solemn Cut and colour, Where a priestly friend might pray; Then her voice assumed the dolour Of a pallid penitent, And she rose up like a column Of the dear Establishment. In subscription Lists, her name was always foremost; And she once gave her Egyptian Bonds or plagues, but yet her own, To the cause which they adore most Who on Temperance have grown. Painted Biddy, Though a widdy, Had a host of hot admirers (Quite perspirers) Ready to divide the spoil Which they fancied she possest, With a maximum of toil And a minimum of rest. So they liked to fetch and follow, And upon a courteous leg Bow and beg; Though I knew the nut was hollow, And a maggot Merely occupied the shell. If she boasted Of her riches and her hoard, Yet her nose smelt out the faggot Where she would be rightly toasted (Though a member of our Board) Down in h—ll! But she had a virtuous blending With some honey, And secreted not pure gall; She was generous in spending Others' money, Squeezing from them by her wiles And those false affected smiles, At her pleasure, Coin and credit without measure— Quite a bankful, Coal and beeftea and good wine And the choicest things in raiment (For her sugared words repayment); But was then alas! unthankful, And continued still to whine, Still to ask and still went further; While her victims thought of murther And still somehow kept on giving More and more To her never-sated store, And men wondered they were living. For refusal led to slander New and old, With infractions of the Bible; And our careful Alexander, Though a copper-smith, dropt gold— To escape her thirst for libel. And her name, despite her nature, Was uplifted As the sifted Precious grain, by every Press-cat And the local legislature; Till the journals, which she read, Praised the Lord that she was dead With a snuffling “Requiescat.” And cried Amen, Clerks and laymen. O BAAL, HEAR US! Baal is king Of our latter society, Secular, sacred—both under his wing, Schooling and fooling each modern variety Heedless of codes or a plain contrariety— Baal is king! Broaden his temples and gather him gold All of the finest, a generous fee; Spinsters may fret and the dowager scold, Yet must we offer our best for his coffer, Whether we earn or abstract what we proffer— Bowing the knee. Baal is Lord Of the soul and the body, Swaying the sceptre or baring the sword; Feared by philosopher, friend to the noddy— Clothed in the life of the sham and the shoddy— Baal is Lord! Burn to him incense and pray at his shrine Mumbling petitions though dying or dead, Bringing him treasures of women and wine; Clamour and caring, and spoil without sparing Down to the last little crumb or least paring— Bowing the head. Baal is God And his cloisters are clouded, Worn by the worshippers' feet that have trod Daily and gaily each avenue crowded Deep with his awe and in mystery shrouded— Baal is God! Sacrifice victims, your babies and wives, Leaving the happiest homes but a wreck Pallid with perishing loves and your lives; Grudge not the nearest and lavish your dearest, Though the young light of the morning is clearest— Bowing the neck. Baal is best And he asks not for morals, Only the paint and his dupes to be drest; Dealing then largely the bells and the corals Suited to slaves who aspire not to laurels— Baal is best! Give him your heart or the masking at most, One in the end and a mockery still— Even if conscience arise as a ghost; Study mere manners, and strive for the banners Waved over wisdom that puffeth his planners— Bowing the will. Baal is all Though the fools are religious, Looking to Christ and obeying His call Dumbly and humbly in service litigious, Prating of doctrines and doings prodigious— Baal is all! Work for him, weep for him, honour him yet Drudging along the same weary old track Grimly bedewed with the blood and the sweat, Poured on the pages of dutiful stages— This is your tribute, and these are his wages— Bowing the back. Baal is first, And he brooks not affection Paid unto others for whom we may thirst; Innocent homage and vain recollection, Slain by his priests who resent resurrection— Baal is first! Live for him, die for him, mother and child, Gray beard and youth, who despise all control; What if his fountains be doom'd and defil'd, When they bring station for bosoms' oblation? Drink (and be damned) of his earthly salvation— Bowing the soul. THE PLYMOUTH BROTHER. I have always been partial to blessed St. Peter, And accustomed to take off my hat When I entered a Church with his presence completer, After wiping my shoes on the mat. For I feel he was human, and most in the trial When he yielded to weakness and fell; And I too should have uttered his faithless denial Were I tempted, and cursed quite as well. And his mortal infirmities draw him yet nearer To my foibles, and render us kin; And I humbly confess that my fellows are dearer, Who resemble me likewise in sin. So it happened one day when his prudence was sleeping And the evening uncommonly late, I secured his permission a moment for peeping Just inside the celestial gate. I had sworn to my hatred of cocks and such vermin With vulgarity's notes at all hours, And I said I was sure he would rightly determine In my favour the use of his powers. 'Twas the least of offences, the lightest concession To my earthliness, thus to unbar; And on me (not on him) would devolve the transgression, If he left the great portal ajar. As I gazed through the crevice at mysteries boundless, With set eyes and an angular chin; Lo, a “Brother” from Plymouth came creeping up soundless, And before Peter knew it was in. Then, believe me, the wretch with his Bible propounded Which he bore like a bayonet's point, With all learning and logic and reason confounded Put authority's nose out of joint. There was discord at once in the beautiful heavens, And a shadow swept over the sky; For the angels were wildly at sixes and sevens, With their harps and their haloes awry. First he button-holed Paul on the score of election, And made nonsense of faith and the facts; Till the worthy Apostle deplored Resurrection, And resolved a new course of the “Acts.” Then he went for poor James in a fury fanatical, And maintained that mere works were no ground; While he dubbed his Epistle as clearly schismatical, And the teaching absured and unsound. Till he showed that the authors brow-beaten and smitten, Who had lacked his superior aid, Never wrote what their ignorance thought they had written And said nothing of what they had said. But the doctrine of John was not his or Exclusive, He observed, when he cornered the Saint; And his language at last was so coarse and abusive, The Evangelist almost turned faint. As for even Apollos, he doubted his greatness In the scriptures and asked for a proof; If he gave us the “Hebrews” so void of sedateness, With a style like a buffalo's hoof. Till in utter despair that most erudite person, Wisely deeming a pitfall was set And forewarned by the fate of the Musty Macpherson, Cried the case was not settled as yet. And then Timothy fled in a horrible panic, Though he knew Holy Writ very well; For he had a suspicion of treason Satanic, And perceived a peculiar smell. Not the odour, alas, of a Christian piety— But a reek of a rabider hue, Pettifogging, and cavil of sheer contrariety To whatever was ancient and true. For a glance at that visage, so furtive and foxy, Was enough to intimidate all; While the “Brother” in Heaven bewailed orthodoxy, And lamented the Deity's fall. He was noisy and rough and profoundly religious, And despoiling the Bible he spared Not a tome or a text in his frenzy litigious, And denied what at first he declared. He was querulous too as the feeble Andromache And not slack in hysterical fears, While he watered the soil of each barren logomachy With a feminine tribute of tears. He was mixed in his views of the Fathers' theology, And to saints and historians rude; He looked down with contempt on our Newman's “Apology,” And his fingers he snapped at dear Jude. But as Peter protested and thought of the apple, Yet one more out of Plymouth popt in; Who was fresh from his strife with both Church and the Chapel, And with carping grown mangy and thin. But then he was Inclusive, and so with a sputter They suggested a cold in the head, The Exclusive slipt off, for he wanted no butter Of that kind to turn bitter his bread. And the second arrival, detecting a “Brother” Who was built on a narrower base, And the rank Nonconformity smell of the other, Made his exit at once and gave chase. STEAM DEVILRY. Engines and axles and pistons and rods, Snorting and sporting and sweating away, Building us Churches and chattels and gods, Teaching us methodised murder in play; Yoking the thunder and lightning to steel Riven and driven to perfected form, Bidding brute forces walk humbly at heel Tamed as the fire, and attempering storm; O ye are mighty though merciless powers Crashing and thrashing out purpose and plan, But from the fulness of terrible dowers Make us a man! Broaden us charters, and charities weld Stronger and longer to triumph on time, Vast as the loves of the heroes of Eld, Sweeter than music and poems in crime; Give us an utterance larger than steam, Ready and steady for problems of night, Glad to deliver its message or dream, Leaving all space with its perfume more bright; Read us the riddle of tears, and the clue Pleading and leading from blighting and ban Into a haven of happier blue— Make us a man! Boilers and furnaces, wonders in wheels, Funnels like tunnels a-roaring to hell Gospels of blood till the universe reels, Sick with the smoke and the smother and smell; Cranks and ye cogs that go working at will Nations' damnations and sputter and spume, Marvels infernal of horrible skill, Swart as the fires that lost regions illume; Out of your cranes and your pulleys and pumps, Devilries' revelries, spitting your span, Earthquake, eclipse and demoniac thumps— Make us a man! Soften the burdens of bitterest woes Binding and grinding the toilers to dust, Out of the reach of our ruinous foes Raise us to something more lofty than lust; Forth from the turmoil and stutter and stir, Spewing and chewing of fangs as they swear Pounding along with a whizzing and whirr, O from destruction a minute forbear! Sweeten the cup of our sorrow, and churn Peace to inspire us to do what we can Dimly, however ye bellow and burn— Make us a man! Forges and levers of iron and steel Moaning and groaning and panting in strife Darkly, that when ye devour us do kneel Though not to God, and are glutted with life; Poisoning water and sowing in earth Sadness and madness and cursing and blight, Turning our Eden to desert and dearth Canopied over at noontide with night; Scattering sickness and sorrow with dire Suction, eruction, where bright rivers ran Gaily beneath the old cloister and spire— Make us a man! Not a machine, or a toy and a tool Drudging a grudging dim pathway of pain, On the same millround that fetters the fool Down to his inch with a grovelling chain; Not a mere pivot or part of your whole Stamping and champing in discord and dusk, Squeezing right out all the beautiful soul While ye allow him the leavings and husk; Ah, with your hubbub and howling and reek— Spoiling and soiling what goodness began, Graces that now we find not if we seek— Make us a man! Hammers and anvils and rivets, and gear Shaking and raking the bowels of rocks, Weapons deforming the world by the fear Shadowing all with their sinister shocks; Plagues, that like sacrilege ruthlessly brand Creatures with features that are not their own, Taking away half the spell from the land While ye exult in the sins ye have sown; Where is the profit in serfdom and dire Progress, the ogress, that scouts as we scan Glories of nature which daily expire— Make us a man! Lighten our troubles, and lessen the care Sapping and lapping around like a sea Rolled with the surges that wreck us and spare Nothing, and never yet harkened to plea; Crown us with dignity, ease and repose Cheering and steering the State and its ark, Unto the haven of dreams that disclose Shelter and anchorage safe in the dark; Mete to us liberty, leisure and grace, Not the mud crest of the billowing van Only a monster of passion and pace— Make us a man! Engines and axles and pistons that yet Ravish, and lavish your tempest and tears, Filling our acres with ruddier sweat Poured from the harvest of dolorous years; Fed with the sighs and the sobbings of toil Bending and spending its majesty's might, Just to add shackles and shame to the coil Weighing us down, when the soul wants delight; Grim as a giant octopus, your mesh Purges and scourges with flame like a fan, Stern as a judgment, the mind and the flesh— Make us a man! Give us more promise of pleasure and room, Diet of quiet, not deified haste Robbing the dawn of its dew and the bloom, Turning the fairness of things but to waste; Stay for a moment this nightmare of noise, Hurry and flurry and fever and rage, So that our lives may recover their poise Stepping at large on a healthier stage; Leave us some beauty and strength for the poor Places and faces ye torture and tan, Not a mere peg or a stupefied boor— Make us a man! THE STRAYED ANGEL. He left alas! the door of Heaven ajar— It was the watchman Peter, Who wandered off to chat with Paul afar How faith might grow completer; If they could now decide which was the one And only true proportion, Without the least distortion, Of faith and works whereby God's will was done; And then and thus of course arose the fuss Recorded in these pages, When zeal misposed forgot the gate unclosed To trouble meet for ages. A little Angel who was tired of song And praise for ever going With innocence that did not dream of wrong Came sweetly up tiptoeing; And at a glance she saw no guardian grim Was waiting at the portal, That shut in the immortal— No Porter hummed his solitary hymn; And peeping out to satisfy her doubt She felt a fatal wonder, If other strains brought with them weary pains In worlds outside and under. Then forth she stept with finger to her lips Right through the golden entry, Regardless of the rules and danger slips When she descried no sentry; And wide she spread her pretty wings and Flew Straight to the nearest planet, And marvelled what began it Or how to such surpassing grace it grew; She travelled on, while glory shook and shone From each white waving feather, And all afire in infinite desire With love she sailed together. Until she saw a spark of emerald light That trembled in the distance, And though with rays refreshing to the sight Seemed asking her assistance; And in a moment she was there and came Upon a moonbeam gliding And in its silver hiding, Robed in the shadow of her own pure shame; For in the vast Expanse was rest at last, And so she left her pinions Just at the shore of Time, as none before In quest of new dominions. She touched the Earth and in a city dropt Where men and beasts were sleeping, And from the silence as awhile she stopt, Went up the dirge of weeping; What did it mean? For never had her ear Met with the sound of sadness Where life was love and gladness, And all her bosom thrilled with sudden fear; Till looking low and through the curtained glow Whence rose the waft of crying, She saw how cold amid a cloud of gold A little babe was lying. And a great pity filled the Angel's heart, To mark that sorrow surging Around one soul set as an isle apart In a wide sea of scourging; So in unseen she slipt with noiseless grace And not a plume to rustle, Too swift to make a bustle, And lightly took the dear dead infant's place; But then the hue flowed back in brighter blue To eyes now full of blisses, And lips rose-red with passion all unfed Unclosed and asked for kisses. And the quick sense of higher things passed soon Away with the broad vision, Which swept through Mighty Space from sun to moon And wrought of Time derision; The splendour faded from the spirit now That took a mortal vesture, And every tiny gesture Was human and to earth conformed the brow; She learnt with years the tender use of tears, And behind bars of clothing To snatch as toys the glimpses of old joys, And found a fresh betrothing. And with the contact of our grosser air Beneath the carnal sentence She waxed less heavenly but O not less fair, And smiled and sought repentance; She showed the impress of her altered lot, A different law and being, And walked too much by seeing Or here or there assumed a pretty spot; But in the strife of this rude worldly life She felt no hope arrested, And never yearned for summits undiscerned Or craved for wings divested. The former fashion now was but a dream That gave a moment's trouble, A bit of sky just mirrored in the gleam Upon a passing bubble; She stretched new tendrils to the dew and light With calm and free consenting, Although a strange relenting Stirred sometimes in her heart for upward flight; And the sweet chime of recollected time With its immortal message, Rang in her mind with hopes and fears combined Instead a glorious presage. She grew at length to hug the little stains Of earthlier affection, She revelled in her rose-hung prison chains And chosen imperfection; She quite forgot the tyranny of song, And the perpetual praising Of voices still upraising The same one endless theme she bore so long; Though casual keys that rattled made a breeze Within her of quaint terror, And the mere name of Peter woke the shame Of unremembered error. But O what evil through the unguarded door Was done by careless Peter, Who knew that angels from the crystal floor Fell once, if now discreeter! Yet no, for when they missed their little friend And saw that outside glimmer, Their sense of right grew dimmer, They dared to play the truant and descend; They took their harps of dulcet flats and sharps, They spared no palm to flutter. They packed their crowns and haloes and white gowns And left the silence utter. Meanwhile the Two, who dwelt on high affairs, Discussed the modes and measure Of faith and works and creeds that begged repairs, And argued at their pleasure; The one indulged in learning and loud speech And logic full of bristles As crabbed as his epistles, The other all a-flame did nought but preach; They proved that faith was not an idle wraith, Though works must make it stiffer, But could not count to each the right amount And so agreed to differ. They did not see the figures trooping by Through that neglected doorsill, In search of mischief and a lower sky And just one luscious morsel; They did not note the pulse of hurrying feet, And hear a harp wire cracking Or there the sound of packing, And everywhere a movement shy and fleet; They did not know the bait of things below, And the forbidden apple Might lure the Church from its celestial perch To earth's poor vulgar chapel. But, when the Porter came to claim his own, He found what never dreamt he; For every bird had seized the chance and flown, And the great Nest was empty; He found no harp or even a golden string, But one enormous feather— For it was moulting weather— From Gabriel's holy archangelic wing; “Fret not,” said Paul, “Heaven is no place at all, Ut aiunt docti semper, But just a state of feeling and of fate—” “Or,” Peter cried, “a Temper.” STATE NURSING. They wrapt It (yes, the People) up in clothes And tied it round and round with many bands, But gave it all things that a Baby loathes And coddled with a thousand thousand hands; They fed it and they bled it every hour And fooled it and then cooled to give it power; But wondered it grew thinner; They laid it down in its grandmother's gown, And lifted up for dinner; They nursed it and they cursed whene'er it cried, They blessed it and caressed it if it tried To play the precious sinner. They would not let it walk a single pace, They did not grant its little limbs relief And smothered both its body and the face In silver paper or a handkerchief; They stroked it and they poked its tiny chest, They took it and they shook it till unrest Pursued its sleep as well as waking; They mocked its thumbs with pills like sugar plums, And useless toys for ever breaking; They teased it and appeased it with mere shams, They told it who controlled it sheep were lambs And idly left its heart more aching. Its bonds were such that it could never grow, With straps and checks and rules and patent laws Which kept it in a helpless state below And when it asked for freedom dealt it straws; They washed it and they squashed it with new salves, They shut it in and cut in cruel halves Its few remaining cakes and pleasures, And added pains of all the earthly chains That could destroy the best of treasures; They hedged it and they wedged it beyond harm, They stopt it and they propt it from alarm Until it could not breathe for measures. They watched its going out and coming in, They fenced its rising up and lying down And tucked it close with bibs unto the chin For fear of colds in country or in town; They swaddled it and coddled it in gloves Or smothered it and brothered it with loves, And buried it beneath convention; They carried it to guard against a fit, Or fall or any least declension; They made it as they bade it not run out, To cure it and insure it from the gout, And killed with overmuch attention. NEBULAR ENGLISH. They talked for full an hour by Greenwich time, The poet and the high debater; They heard the great clock strike the quarters chime And made a feast of reason and of rhyme, But still the mental fog grew greater; For words had lost their leaning and their use, And come to have a meaning so profuse That not a mortal now could tell What others said with all the clearest aid Of dictionaries' learnèd spell; One might be playing golf, one at the wicket, But each alike was in a hopeless thicket. The Poet murmured on in misty flowers Of speech, and worlds with golden axes Refulgent rose and trembled into towers, Where giant creeds had carved their deathless dowers; The Statesman dealt on tolls and taxes, Imperial needs that present were and asked New policies or pleasant issues masked, In diplomatic doubtful style; And either hoped the other also coped With the same cause, with cultured smile. Though one trod earth and one tried eagle pinions, Both looked through clouds that darkened both dominions. In spacious terms that might have covered all The widest truths or simply nothing, The Statesman with the webs that flocked at call Strove now for triumph, now a splendid fall, And buried facts in gorgeous clothing; The Poet proudly travelled through the air, Which at his touch unravelled columns fair And classic courts of sudden light, With purple bloom that shadowed every room Insufferable to the sight; But each, though miles and miles apart, was certain Each meant the same thing from his dusky curtain. And thus they babbled on in courteous lines, Ambiguous words and empty phrases, And laid in chaos grand foundation stones For worlds of wind and insubstantial thrones, And mingled precedents and daisies; Till at the hour they parted blindly friends, Who never met and started diverse ends, Yet satisfied that both had won; And then were fain to fight out yet again, What still were fruitless and undone. They went, one thought, to join in sweet transgression That night—the other deemed, at sad Confession. THE MORAL MINIMUM. Passing from the Living Wage and by some queer transition, We have reached a further stage right onward to Perdition; With a growing grandeur in our paper theories and din Cursing ways refined and slower, With the aid of fife and drum towards the Moral Minimum Dropping every day yet lower. Dying Capital may perish with its golden eggs and goose, Now the precious things we cherish all are played with fast and loose Or go dangling in the strangling of the fatal cord and noose; We are falling downward deeper, Sentinel alike and sleeper, With a sombre funeral hum towards the Moral Minimum. What the final goal of rest is, what the gleam remaining For our property opprest and idly still complaining, No one knows and no one cares if forward still the current fares To its undetermined haven; While they clip our treasures' sum to speed the Moral Minimum, Till we are at last clean shaven. Only pile away the taxes on the sick and suffering land, To the sullen sound of axes sharpening in the hungry hand, Till the People on the steeple and the tower in triumph stand; Fatten more and more the ogress Or the veilèd death called Progress, For the feasting of the slum on the Moral Minimum. I have but a little lot and troubles often dim it, And would like a broader plot and can perceive no limit But my own sweet appetite, which now is almost infinite In the great and growing scramble. Why should I not thrust my thumb within the Moral Minimum, And have vines instead of bramble? Why not help myself from labours of the fools who heap and toil, And wax rich upon my neighbour's private hoard and fruitful soil, With a measure of his pleasure and abounding corn and oil? Why need I go tamely trudging And along my millround drudging, Or look desolate and glum when there's a Moral Minimum? When the tiger once set free of human blood has tasted And the blinded Masses see, the spoiling will be hasted Fast and faster to the point at which the State is out of joint And at sixes and at sevens; Each will want a goodly crumb to be his Moral Minimum, With new earth and (hell called) heavens. Ploughs will rust within the furrow and the landlords even lack Bread and cheese and meanly burrow, with no wealth but on the back And scarce pottage, in some cottage the one poor surviving wrack: Trade will spread its splendid pinions Far to more secure dominions, And the workshop will be dumb with this Immoral Minimum. THE GREAT QUACK. I am the great god Quack and I carry the world on my back, With my potions and pills for your ailments and ills, As I tread on my merciful track. To me ye must come, to me ye must come To the gentle physician's call; Here are drugs for some, here are drops for some, And a panacea for all. I have drenches for wenches, that stop with their stenches The very worse sickness at once, I have balm for the miser and meat for the wiser And drams for the silliest dunce. Won't you buy of me, try of me Out of your wealth vigour and health? Ah, you need not he shy of me, Seeking my favours and flavours and savours In darkness by stealth. I am ready and steady your friend for each time And each trouble and clime, and as sure as the chime Of the clock which the sinner awakes to his dinner— I heal for a dime. I am the great god Quack and I carry your cures in my pack, With my ointments and salves that do nothing by halves And will never for maladies lack. To me ye must come, to me ye must come From your factory mills and the mines; Here is life for all, here is love for some And the best of anodynes. For the masses and classes and lads and the lasses, I keep the most bountiful stores; See my boxes of Science, and bags of reliance For healing your sins and your sores! Won't you take of me, make of me Father and friend true to the end, While you purchase for sake of me Help for your blindness, unkindness, behindness, And quickly amend? I am handy for dandy and sloven, with quill For the author at will, for the Member a Bill; And my marvellous Tonic has something Byronic For the bard and new skill. THE LOST ART OF SUCKING EGGS. My dear Grannie, the art that you cherished— Namely, sucking your eggs the best way, Seems at length now almost to have perished, And poor folks hardly know how to play; We are serious O and mysterious In our pleasures and business and all, And we carry our cares when we marry Through the honeymoon back to the Hall; We are merry and mad out of season At the fast and the funeral bell, While our laughter and tears have no reason And we choose the wrong partners for treason— Romping into the Courts and their smell. We have lost the true manner of living And rejoice in a furious march, Our New Woman (the Devil's own giving) Shuffles out of her stays and the starch; To run better at least without fetter, Moulting troublesome morals and modes, And (like traces and tenderer graces) Inconvenient collars and codes; Till our period misses the brightness Which adorned the pursuits of the past, And the touch of a delicate lightness That made absolute order and rightness Is exchanged for the foolish and fast. All the dignity now has departed With the colour and sweetness and glow, Our delights in their depths heavy-hearted Seem to surge from abysses below; For perspective we have the Objective And no more the blue distance and space, While distortion upsets the proportion Which for every dear trifle found place; And, alas! for the fragrance of roses Shovelled off by more practical tools, The refinements and dainty reposes, When our gray Education uncloses The grim Edens of Boards and their schools. The new fashions but fetter and skimp us In honour of cotton and gloom, And for Heaven we have an Olympus Swept each day by Society's broom; God was clearer to you and far dearer Than he can be to gammon and greed, When good horses and dirty divorces Are the points in the popular creed; Then He was not a form or a fable And inspired the chief poems and Art, With the principal seat at the table Not dethroned for the stye and the stable, And the flowers grew out of His heart. My dear Grannie, it's no use protesting, We must follow the times as they spin— If they come to the worst, and divesting Our decent old rags to the skin; They mean motion in fun and devotion And parade of fresh fronds and tall shoots, With the savour of sour fruits in favour— Though the worn may be gnawing the roots; It is pace and the boom of sensation And queer readings of Peter and Paul, Wild virginity, sexy relation— And a version revised of the Fall. That white wonder of exquisite glamour, The fair woman God fashioned to shine, Is all drowned in the drum and its clamour With her human attraction divine; Ah, the cincture is sold for a tincture Of a vice to make profligates blush, And nude actions that flout the least fractions Of fig leaves in their masculine flush; And a thing that is saucy and sated With unmaidenly raptures and reels, Goes a path that is filthy and fated And in antics that can't be narrated Shows a pair of unbeautiful heels. You have told me before you wore mittens Or had glasses and halted in tread, And old pussies did not ape their kittens Nor the young discard butter and bread; When the glory of earth was a story That the fool could with reverence read, And the trouble of life not made double By the guides whom the gutterlings lead; You have told me, if now you are cappy And can walk but on crutches with pain, People once were true people and happy And not dull and discursive and flappy With such feathers and fantasies vain. And I heard you with interest often Say that manners were statelier then, While the women had hearts that would soften And the world showed magnificent men; For a quorum was still for decorum In the wildest excess or abuse, And propriety kept your society From the passions that have no excuse; And they knew the right method of sucking Any eggs that might fall to their share Without starving the layers or plucking, And did not kill the hens for mere clucking In delight at the blessings they bare. My dear Grannie, the customs are altered, For we slay the producers of food And our makers to market go haltered At the stupid majority's mood; In the present we live and it's pleasant While the capital lasts to be gay, And for verity or our posterity No one harvests an hour in the day; So we eat and we drink and we borrow From the future and mock at the past, We decline to see danger and sorrow And the reckoning meant for the morrow— When the judge adds the figures at last. And our eggs, which lie all in one basket, Are now broken of course at both ends— It's the practice, and few persons mask it— And no others remain and no friends; We are greedy and mind not the needy, Or the stores and the granaries piled By the toiling of sires in the broiling At noon, and our wells are defiled. Who takes thought of the children that follow, Who provides us the ghost of a plan To refill the great barns that they hollow, In their gluttonous fury to swallow Any loaves, any fishes they can? You had statesmen and henwives, and plenty Of the goose that laid nothing but gold; We have leaders, some but sweet and twenty— And divided, without a true hold. It is talking for ever and walking Up and down with nought usefully done, And cold merriment from each experiment By which only worse losses are won. We have garrulous council and meeting And the latest impossible board, But the mistress at home is but fleeting With perpetual gossip and greeting, And the master is also abroad. In your days they were close to our mother The old earth in their pleasure and toil, And fine feelings they cared not to smother Had the healthy sweet scent of the soil; Now it's hurry ungraceful and worry From the morning and through the whole night For the capture of some recent rapture With no ray from distinction or light; They are sounding the cesspit and gutter For fresh fancies to jewel their throne, And while hearing the hiccough and stutter I could think in the emptiness utter We were sucking the eggshells alone. My dear Grannie, to be like the smartest And the class that most handsomely spends Soul and body, and still as an artist, You must eat every egg at both ends; If you fiddle as well on the middle And all round you can hardly do wrong, The more cracking of hearts the less lacking Of amusements for sinning or song; So good bye, with best love, my dear Grannie. Though we soon shall have little but dregs Of delights, be we ever so canny; I remain your affectionate Annie,— With a taste for the sucking of eggs. PIOUS OPINIONS. I have plenty of notebooks and pious opinions Which cost nothing to you or to me, About all men and things in our country's dominions— Pray, accept them for what they may be! Here they are, as they are! Valeant quantum valent! Just my personal views of the taste and the talent And the sinners and saints of our time, With too many a poet but merely one Jowett, And complacency worse than a crime! I pretend not, like critics, to know Quite de omnibus rebus—Diana and Phœbus— For I live very much down below. Well, the fact that first strikes an impartial spectator Who is ready to listen and looks, Is a sight that might puzzle the very Creator With its million of papers and books. Every day, every hour, they are spawned by our presses And come forth with most marvellous doctrines and dresses, To regenerate Nature and earth; But in spite of their poses and myths upon Moses, In their husks is a pitiful dearth. We have prating from morning to night, And a terrible clatter though it settles no matter— But what ray of the glorious Light? And each emptiest babbler has still his own journal To protect him and puff all he writes, And to call his last rapture and rubbish eternal— Though he crawls as the meanest of mites. Not a Milton or Shakspeare receives half the praises Or the monuments which any moment upraises, To the poorest ephemeral now; For the crowns of our greatest are nought to the latest, And the Laurels they pile on his brow. Ah, in lexicons vainly men seek, While they ransack their portals to deck the immortals Of at utmost a day or a week. O we have a young school with a yellow complexion Of the pert Bumble-Puppy fresh kind, But devoted to writing before the reflexion, Which goes in for a manner not mind. It upsets the old models, and gay and elastic Shuts the door upon splendid ideals monastic In its picturesque jargon and gowns, And with swashbuckler swagger and pasteboard-made dagger Gives the harlot and highwayman crowns; While it damns the great classical codes, It takes morals and fables from stews and the stables And from gutters its methods and modes. And our day has discovered a wonderful merit, A new virtue that used to be vice, In unchastity which the next age will inherit With our shoes at a terrible price; It's all sexiness now, with the fig leaves discarded For a prurient wisdom, and woman unguarded In a riotous privilege romps, While the maidens are boldest in licence and oldest At their lewd Saturnalian pomps; And the modesty once as a glass For most delicate graces is gone with no traces, And the gold has been bartered for brass. But from morning to night it's a pestilent hurry From this horrible orgy to that, And we live in a purposeless fever and worry Quite in ignorance what we are at; And the leper is whitewashed and scrubbed till be pleases The fastidious nostril, and plagues and diseases Offer play for unnatural parts, And the vilest dissections that claim the affections Now are practised as beautiful arts; We have cancerous cases and skill Is more ardently lavished on innocence ravished, While we leave poor descendants the bill. If our prophets could see half as well as they chatter, They would find overfact a pure curse, Out of season as dirt (though a truth) is but matter Out of place in the trencher or purse. It's not facts but the fictions that clothe with a sweetness And a bliss beyond words our lean starved incompleteness, While they hide what is ugly and hard; And it makes no lot better to gloat on its fetter Or show where it is cruelly scarred. As the members we decently drape Were not meant for disclosing, we sin by exposing All the lusts of the tiger and ape. I for one will complain of the dignity dying If not dead and quite buried in shame, And the gods of our glory departed and crying For the honour that knows not their name. O the quiet and ease are dethroned by a scramble For the pleasure or gain, and we helplessly shamble Through our duties as quick as we may; For the sake of just doing without the old wooing, All we can in a businesslike day. Not a margin for beauty or thought, But a rush and a wriggling and hatred and higgling Of the souls as mere merchandise bought. THE PROBLEM AND THE PROFESSOR. I never will believe, that our Professor Who burrows so profoundly in Greek Roots And wears a model coat and patent boots Can have become so sudden a transgressor, As he is widely said to be at last; I stand aghast. No man thrice twenty, Nemo repente Would ever be, could ever be turpissimus; And he ipsissimus! Why, it is quite a proper man, stipendiary, And pious too and of the Church a pillar— At least, from the outside—a tried fulfiller Of each grave decent duty, no incendiary Or ravisher of creeds and cults; a quiet Old-fashioned and respectable Good solid person, most delectable To curates and the spinsters and the rest, And careful in his diet. He never bore a firebrand in his breast, Or launched one flaming phrase And scorched his fingers With burning questions and some boiling phase Of vice or Venezuela. Nay, he lingers Over his wine and walnuts and conventions Which social use has made its own, and sweet With centuried wont; he has no crude intentions, Or doctrine which might savour of the street And gutter. O no! He takes his tea at five, thin bread and butter, And goes just whither gentlemen should go In regulation ruts; he's safe and sound, Both wind and limb, in all the ancient articles And all decorum's particles, Do be convinced, and treads the common round Of commonplace and common sense society, And has no kick in him of impropriety. But he to drop unseemly terms as oaths! He were as likely, sir, without his clothes To dance a drunken measure And at some Moenad's pleasure Cut capers in gymnosophy— He who is quite three parts at least philosophy! His character is good, and then his learning Above suspicion; He has no yearning For primrose paths, that lead men to perdition And penury and shame With broken knees and name— Not he! we pay him to be strait and steadfast, And nice and dull with dignity; He keeps his balanced head fast Amid the storms of error and malignity Or ponderous German jokes—the Higher Criticism, Too vague for tears, too vast for witticism And mouldy ere the book—he prays by proxy, No doubt, and sends his wife to early Matins For him and knows but nought of pyx and patins— But who can doubt his orthodoxy? And then there is the honour of the Chair, So far-descended, wide-extended And venerable and most fair, The heritage of ages and the sages With its historic air; That has a whiff of Bentley's gown, And was the chosen stair By which the grand old scholars won renown And climbed, by no venality, To their Pantheon and their immortality! This stands at stake, in peril, If our Professor's Sobriety has failed and flesh prevailed To turn his studies sterile And all unworthy of his predecessors. O when he speaks of just the merest platitude, He has a pretty ex cathedra attitude And makes his minnows talk like whales; When he regales Our appetites with hoary jests, they catch A reflex glory from the Chair, A solemn and a sapient air, And hatch Into a new and true and monstrous miracle Of wit, as though it were the spiracle For awful wisdom from above. The mint, Which is his mighty brain Evolves without a strain Each sentence crisp and clean and ripe for print; He has capacity, I can assure you, and will turn you out Great thumping propositions by the dozen, To glut the worst voracity, Or solve you the enigma or the doubt And cozen The clearest mind into a hopeless fog. Yet he is loyal to the Decalogue, And never broke a law or even cracked The lightest of the ten; he has not lacked In reputation aught for life, And covets not his neighbour's wife. If he had sworn in Greek or good round Latin, Which he is pat in, It might have passed—a scholar's trick—no more; And Porson swore In pure and perfect Attic, All know, though he was more erratic And mingled with his verses Such polished classic curses, They sounded just like blessings and could shock Nor Quaker nor a Miss in Sunday frock; O yes, he swore so sweetly, As ladies ply the fan And like a gentleman— Not indiscreetly; The habit fitted him, a graceful vesture, As any little private turn or gesture. And Madame Dacier, Correct and cool and blue as is a glacier, Yet sometimes lilted into oaths Which our refinement loathes, But sanctified when decked in learned dresses And coming out as harmless as caresses Or innocence itself. And, what is odder, Casaubon used to dodder (Unless it's slanderous fiction's Tale) into maledictions, That would not hurt a fly or Puritan And were but milk-sop to an artisan Of the full-blown and healthy modern type, Roaring all hell betwixt his glass and pipe. Nor is there much, I warn you to prefer In Joseph Scaliger, Who drew a daily round of hearty rations From bumper imprecations, And in a decent veil of neat obscurity— Ni fallor—left a witness for futurity. But these were scholars, They wore a fitting mask And mouthed through classic collars, Which our conventions ask, Their dear damnations and abominations. If the Professor too had sworn in German Like Doctor Herman, Who cannot say a sentence without crutches Of awful words and ways, and seems to sputter all His viscera up in groans and every guttural, And what he treats on smutches With smear-like hand; or if in French he fiddled A naughty tune or two, And played the sapeur or what is most torrid Or to our hearing horrid; The burden had been left unriddled, And without more ado. But now I should remember, He told me something—O what was this! Hang it! Which asks from me for no apology, And got none from old “Hang-theology”— He told me last December, When he had ended lecture—how he did harangue it! He was engaged on some tremendous toil, Another Heraklean task, On some lost letter, Which promised him a splendid spoil And even a Falernian cask Or something better. What was it? Ah, I am no scholar With classic idioms pigeon-holed And almost as it were religion-holed, Each with a shrine and halo; but I'd bet a dollar, Here is the secret or its right solution Which would dispel at once the cloud And give his credit handsome restitution— If I remembered what he spoke aloud. Ha, now I have it! Hear me, Porson's ghost, To whom this night I vow a generous toast! He never could have said, “I d—n her”— He, so polite, who has been known to bow Unto a cow— Dr. Duncan actually did this. But what he did say was, “Digamma.” THE BLUE HOURS When the midnight now is over, and the shy excursive mouse Deems it safe to be a rover in the silence of the house, With the pitter and the patter of uneducated matter Not afraid of pussy's grip, And the usual merry cricket from the dim and dusty thicket Of the ashes tunes his pipe; And the heavy chair and table seem to move to secret song Or the sofa grows unstable as if darkly drawn along, With a creaking and a squeaking at the touch of viewless hands And a rustling and a bustling of invisible commands; When a host of crooked creatures with their surreptitious features, From the hearth behind the stone Come with furtive speech and sprawling and a creeping and a crawling— Then I love to be alone. When the wall's familiar staining takes a sad and serious hue, Or the shadows want explaining and the gas lights all burn blue; While the depths within the doorway look as far and strange as Norway, And the pictures seem to point At the shapes as shy as mourners huddled in the distant corners, And the room is out of joint; When the solidest of timber fidgets as if fain to dance, And the very tongs unlimber with a noise unknown to chance; While a hopping and a flopping from the passages and stairs, Rise like chidden and forbidden sounds, and from the blackest lairs; When the turning keys and handles seem unlocking hushed-up scandals For which nothing can atone, And the lamp begins to sputter and the wind to moan and mutter— Then I love to be alone. When the sense that I am haunted by a Thing I cannot see Comes, and courage widely vaunted is no longer calm and free; And a horror not unpleasant that a mystery is present, Stepping more and still more near, With a sort of icy shudder shakes the will from off its rudder In a grim delightful fear; As the swaying swelling curtain has a queer suggestive look, And the outlines are uncertain of the most decided nook; While a knocking and a rocking which I really cannot place, Vie with sweeping of unsleeping robes that walk through empty space; When a movement growing crisper to an universal whisper, That no draughts may quite condone, Wakes with trailing as of shackles and a foot of fire that crackles— Then I love to be alone. When the keen and quickened pulses tell me by an instinct true Awful knowledge that convulses, and the air itself turns blue; And the ghosts of buried vices by a glamour that entices Memory from solemn caves, With a gaunt accusing gesture, veiled in cerements as vesture, Start from their forgotten graves; When the sins and all the errors of the never-dying past, Clothed in dumb delicious terrors, serpent-wise round me are cast; And the nameless thoughts and shameless which seem proper to the hour, With a quiver and a shiver clutch me in their ghastly power; And the reason now relenting with a criminal consenting Bears me to the Astral Zone, And each fancy out of fable mixes Bedlam up with Babel— Then I love to be alone. ERGA—PARERGA. “Bring thy erga,” said the Judge, Calm and lone upon the throne; And I trembled like an aspen, nor dissembled What I felt—and I with nothing to atone. But good Peter gave a nudge, And encouraged me to hearken Though the heaven appeared to darken, And I hardly dared to budge. For the angels and archangels by the chiliad Ranged around us, as expectant of an Iliad; While my record looked so mean, And before those eyes unclean. “Bring thy erga,” said the Voice From the white deep infinite Of the Glory past imagining and story, Gleaming, burning, with a glamour exquisite. And my weakness had no choice But to make the last dread moving For the Audit's solemn proving, And had little to rejoice. Ah, and Cherubim and Seraphim like throstles Sang at intervals, and all the twelve Apostles Stood about in shining dress, And I seemed but filthiness. “Bring thy erga.” So I came With no friend who could attend On my trouble, and partake of it and double Any confidence that laboured to ascend. I had gathered in my shame Gold, a goodly pile and portion, Fruits—if garnered with extortion And a crown of dubious fame. These in bags-full groaningly I hugged and carried Through the phalanxes of splendour, though I tarried Often and bent dumbly down— For all heaven became one frown. “Bring thy erga”—And I laid Low my bags like dirty rags, As I drivelled in the Light and shrank and shrivelled, Though to me before they flaunted gay as flags, And my heart was sore afraid. While to James Paul rudely stammered, “Have I then but vainly hammered On men, works are useless aid?” And poor James retreated as if met by bristles, At the thought of those long-winded dear epistles; And I wondered, who would next Make me his appropriate text. “Bring thy erga!” And I saw No more sheaves but withered leaves, Husks and losses and a treasury like drosses, Wreck and rubbish as if stuff from ragged eaves Blown by tempests' ruthless law; All my ransom and its rightness With the excellence and brightness, Turned to squalid trash and straw! And I sadly noticed how my patron Peter Edged away from me, when I proved incompleter Than he thought, not now assuaged— As if otherwise engaged. “Bring thy erga!” And I cried, “I have none but tasks undone, Deeds neglected and my duties' claims rejected For the profit ever wooed and vilely won; And the Master was denied. Never did I dream of brothers, Save what I could squeeze from others— And the Cross I still defied.” Then sweet John whose face was one glad revelation Stept to me with speech that was an inspiration, And he said, “Thy scanty store, Little lover, must have more.” “Hast thou no parerga here?” Murmured John, when hope seemed gone. And my blindness felt a sudden ray of kindness Touch me, which for just a moment bravely shone; Though my greatest gifts were sere, And my life an empty bubble Tost as idly as the stubble, In that holy atmosphere. But when thus the tide was turning in my favour, And the question had a friendly sound and savour; Peter seemed to have a shock, Or to hear some crowing cock. “No parerga?” And I gazed, As he spoke, within my poke, Just inquiring and with pallid brow perspiring When a vestige of his meaning on me broke, Half desponding and half dazed; And I marked, amid the bitter Dust and dregs the hopeful glitter Of a gem or two—amazed. While I nearer looked and caught their coruscation, Mark and Matthew who had held confabulation, Whispered, “Take each precious stone, Lay them down before the Throne.” “No parerga?” And I saw, As I stept and humbly wept With my meagre gifts among a thousand eager Eyes and faces, what I had unconscious kept; Gentle words without the flaw Of a grudging said, and nameless Deeds considered not but blameless— Done for neighbours and no law. Tiny were they, and o'ershadowed by the rotten Heaps of hoarded rubbish there and quite forgotten; Yet they glimmered from the dark, In their little glow-worm spark. “These parerga,” cried the Judge From the night of dazzling Light, “Not the seeming of great acts are thy redeeming!” And, from his arrested and prudential flight, Peter then renewed his nudge; While the hierarchies chanted And on small deserts descanted, When I did not downward trudge. And they brought a harp, a halo, a white garment For my nakedness and sores and every scar meant; Till I sang like birds in June, If a trifle out of tune. PIMPLE AND PATCH. Jonathan Brown Thought he had gotten a heavenly crown, Only because of the wonderful Patch Stuck to his life without any proportion, Darned on his conduct with funny distortion, Just as his roof with its yellower thatch. O and he cried to his cronies, the two, Robert the Radical, Dickson the Tory, “Here is the thing for you sinners to do— I'm going up in a carriage of glory.” Jonathan Brown Thought he had gotten Although he was rotten, Something uncommonly like to a crown. Jonathan Brown Thought that the heaven itself had come down, Only because of his wonderful wart; Aye, and his neighbours the sage and the simple, Sat in the shadow of his pretty Pimple— As if the ocean were clapt in a quart! Cheering themselves on its marvellous length, Colour and bulk and unheard of pomposity; Fain to renew their opinions and strength, Under its shameless and vulgar monstrosity. Jonathan Brown Thought that the heaven Itself was the leaven, Raising him up when he really was down. Jonathan Brown Thought that a deluge was coming to drown All but himself with his Pimple and Patch, Cottager, King, from the pug to the pigeon— Every one not of his own pet religion, Scorning with him on his dung-heap to scratch. Therefore his tongue was as sharp as a sword Whetted by faith on the Patch and the Pimple, Cursing the people and praising the Lord, Sparing no saint nor the child with its dimple. Jonathan Brown Thought that the Devil Would soon have a revel, While he alone was the sinner to drown. SPORTING POLITICS. He takes politics, sir, in a sportsmanlike way, As one should take his fences without weak pretences In a good working day; He will rise at his gate or big measure of State With the surest of seats and the lightest of hands, And the grip that commands. Ah, his fox-hunting knowledge of Church and of College Is a marvel of pride, While he gallops full go to a faint “Tally-ho,” As he covers each question and ditch without fall In his masterly stride; Like a king in his saddle, and monarch of all. Others funk at a Censure and look for a gap In the thornier hedges and cases with edges, But he faces them slap; Not a symptom of nerves in the stiffest preserves, Where the quarry lies closer and stiles are too bad— Never sick, never sad. With the truest of touches (he is there like his Duchess) And strong arms lying low, He will ride to the death leaving far out of breath Other jockeys behind and not in it with Jack, Just to bluster and blow; For, as straight as a bird might, he follows the track. And he pauses not, please, to negotiate walls Or a problem of figures and famishing niggers, And most desperate calls; He is equal, be sure, and as quick as secure, To the hardiest leap with the bridle and bit When he's mounted and fit. The Armenian Question hurts not his digestion, And he tackles it well; For he knows every lane, every bar and its bane, And each turning and corner as smart as the Russ— With his gunpowder smell, And he clears the worst rail or retort and no fuss. In the covert and open for ever the same, With no jobbing or jibbing or delicate fibbing He is honest and game; O he sticks to the trail without fumbling and fail, And right on like a sportsman of England unbent When he once finds the scent; Over bullfinch and timber like Home Rule as limber As the merriest Pat, When his hobby is spread out full length and the head Running free from red tape and conventional bounds, And he's clever at that; He will romp into heaven, as riding to hounds. FIN-DE-SIECLE BABY. Bring no more bottles, Nurse, they trouble me; I thirst for higher food like Aristotle's, And vaster thoughts of that great world to be; I weary too of bibs and cushioned cribs; The inheritance I ask, I would be free. No foolish rhymes, but Noble's last new sonnet, And then the “Times”—not mother's Paris bonnet. Let's speak of politics, I am on fire For some good burning question; I brook no baubles here, I do aspire To more than mere digestion. Long clothes and chrism, Powder, all are vain, Out-grown by us—a pure anachronism; I'm centuries old (not weeks) and bear the pain; Born to the people's woe, and endless throe, To suffer for the world and not complain. No empty talk, I have no silly season, And I could walk too if there were a reason; But it's undignified to romp and run Just as the vulgar rabble, I choose to lie and ponder in the sun And let the others babble. Problems of ages, Nurse, devolve at last On me, and I must step on broader stages Than those before me who have played and past; Yes, grand solutions now do pale my brow, And with the care my life is overcast. I heed no ill; away with pap and ladle! For I must fill a throne, and not a cradle. And what is Truth? That seems the vital point For souls like mine to settle, When all the earth is sadly out of joint— Not how to boil a kettle. Look at our leaders, Waiting to be led By luck or chance, at most but special pleaders Of any cause that gives them power or bread! When here is one who can evolve a plan, And guide them into port and has a head. O give me space, I'll move this ancient order Cramped by its place and find an ample border; You and my parents understand me not And tease with toys and feigning, To starve my genius in a stupid cot— I want a sphere for reigning. THE SCIENTIST. He poked among his beetles as they crept And catalogued their dark and devious ways, Or counted motes that flickered in the rays But saw no sunshine, as a true Adept; He qualified and quantified the dust In every mortal matter, And nibbled round the superficial crust Of planets or a platter; He wondered why things were so very small And classified his nearest kith and kin, Took notes of hairs or wens upon the skin Or grubbed at lichens on the mouldering wall. He marked the curious colours or the shape Of vegetable forms and weighed their powers, But never glimpsed the living laughing flowers And let the magic mystery escape; He labelled and he libelled this and that, The genus and the order, And wiped his feet on Nature's temple mat But did not pass the border; With book and scale and speculum and probe He burrowed, measured, minimized, and crawled From patch to patch by details yet enthralled, And but beheld the shadows of the globe. He felt no rapture in the rising moon, And showed the blueness of the sky was dirt Where sunbeams fell—by which its grace was girt, And in no beauty read the heavenly boon; He knew not that the earth was wondrous fair And could not touch its essence, The glories of the ocean and the air Were each a mere excrescence; He cared not for the poetries of things Nor once descried the picture in the land, And only heard the pricing higgler's hand But not the waving of sweet angel wings. All treasures were just ticketed or not To him, who had no vision for their spell Nor ear for music save his dinner bell, And overlooked the splendour in the spot; For mind and matter were to him but one And bundles of sensation, Or states of feeling vanishing, and none Had any true foundation; He missed the rounded orb, but mapt the blight That lay upon the molecule's dim face, And with his glass that ranged through mighty Space He could not see the Heaven itself for light. IN SUSPENSE. “Who are you?” the Almighty exclaimed, as He sat At the portal where Peter should be, When a gentleman came and uplifted his hat Or what would be—if earthly were he. “Here are welcome and favour for folks of each savour, The highest and lowest and broad; Even statesmen and drinkers and honest free-thinkers, Sometimes get a chair at My board; But I see not a label or docket or mark Of the proper distinguishing hoods, Nor a catalogue, sir, to explain—it's all dark, And I don't pass unticketed goods.” “I'm a simple Agnostic, O Lord, and I swear To my light I was always quite true; I had many a cross and a burden to bear, But I gave every detail its due. I was foe to the fancies of foolish romances And feelings distorting the gaze, Though in circumspect Science I put every reliance And waged war with the crotchet or craze; I reduced my convictions to substance and shape And was careful with dogma and cult, I discovered that man was evolved from the ape And his soul an organic result.” “I remember,” said God, “you threw doubts on My Life, Dark'ning counsel with words of despair, And dissected the pineal gland with your knife But destroyed what you could not repair; You alleged that all being was bounded by seeing, And nothing that quickened or moved In your view low and narrow (not space for a sparrow), Existed unless it was proved; I have seats for your victims and hope for the fool Who at least does the utmost he can, But no nook for the knave who belongs to no school And the shadow at best of a man.” “Ah, a hundred times now I have prayed I might cease From misgivings that bother me still, But I'm blest if I ever can find a release From the habit that palsies my will. And to God have I spoken? Can Silence be broken, Where none may be perfectly sure? Were those words or rebounding, and echoes confounding Of qualms not in fact or secure? Am I, I? Is there aught? Is it only a dream, Out of which I shall waken too well But to guess I'm a straw on some cosmical stream, Which deludes me with Heaven and Hell?” “Who is this?” cried the Devil and looked rather blue With an eye to an orderly sphere, And no room for a skeptic to alter its hue— “Who is this that would trouble me here? Here's a place for the scoffers and slaves of their coffers Who heap up the dollar or gem, A retreat for the artist in vice and the Chartist And the warmest reception for them; I can make a snug corner for sinner and saint In the pit of my sulphurous Show, For they differ but little except for their paint And that soon passes off down below.” “I am just an Agnostic, your Majesty, please, And kept always my judgment in hand, Never daring as others who lied at their ease, To be rude about you and your land; I was prudent and sober as suns in October And did not commit myself once, I avoided decisions that led to derisions And parts both of prophet and dunce; I believed in my senses and reason and such But avoided conjecture and all That I could not establish by testing or touch, Like a beetle and bones or a wall.” “You are no friend of mine,” said the Devil in dread; “And, pray, why are you certain and how You have ended your mortal career and are dead, When you may be but mocking me now? I object to acrostics of idle Agnostics, Who treat me with tentative thought; If you wish to be famous be still Ignoramus, Abide in the fogs you have wrought. Yes, be damned, if you like, and as much as you wish, But I won't have your dark little games; You must fry in your own dear elaborate dish, And not enter to damp out my flames.” “It's alas and alas for the line of my choice, And alas for the doom I have made; Neither God nor the Devil will hark to my voice, In their kingdoms of light and the shade. I've for ages been plying between them and trying In vain for some refuge or rest, Like a pendulum fated and ever unmated In hell or on Abraham's breast. Even yet I am haunted by terrible fears, Which is God, which the Devil? And O What am I? And are these simulacra or tears? And I know that I never shall know.” MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM. (Old style). He is only a poor man, a beggar, a boor man, With an animal trust; A machine for the using that has no refusing, And content with a crust. He's a sheep for the slaughter, at times with a daughter Who may humour our lust. He has feet for rough roads and a back bearing loads, With a stomach for words that are sharper than goads; And in suitable places, the pigwash, the traces, He is helpful—be just! Stiff as steeling, no feeling, though kingdoms are reeling, With a passion for ale and a story if stale, He's a match for the firiest sun or the gale With the iciest gust. Let us grind him and bind him and closer enwind him With our burdens and fetters, and show him his betters— Lest he ever should rust. Do not talk of a guinea, Mum, Keep his wages a minimum In the bondage of dust; With the labour a maximum, Let us bully and tax him, Mum; It's pure prudence, we must. He has sinew and muscle for market, to tussle With his mother the soil; And the dungheap's his brother, the smell and the smother Are his honey and oil; And the things of our loathing, make dinners and clothing— Refuse, rags and old coil. Do not pity in haste his bad living or taste, He is happy with little and feasts on our waste; Though, if weather be cruel, there's tea and the fuel For his kettle to boil. And his station's mean rations, his sole expectations; He's but fitted to squeeze, should he famish or wheeze, And for frost and the snow with their rigours to freeze Or the summer to broil. We can bleed him who need him, and carefully feed him With a measured-out pittance and lowest remittance That will safeguard his toil. And no bother is in him Mum, With his wages a minimum And the mucking and moil. While we sweat him the maximum, Give the shovel and axe him, Mum, And impress as the wax him, Mum, We will collar the spoil. THE DEVIL AND THE SERMON. I preached. And lo, the Devil said He'd spoil my pretty matter With mocking and its merry aid And friends that did not flatter. So then he strode into my church And broke an eyeglass (Bella's), He left the sexton in the lurch And upset six umbrellas. He tumbled down a dozen books And set two babies squalling, While casting round such dreadful looks They feared the roof was falling. He trod upon the tenderest feet And raised a big commotion, They heard it outside in the street— Half drowning our devotion. But then he chose the finest hat To use it just like scrapers, And made a Bible next the mat For sacrilegious capers. And plumping full with all his might On helpless Granny Headlam, He put her pious thoughts to flight And turned the pew to Bedlam. And through her choking bonnet strings, She sighed with sore vexation— “This is the end of mortal things, Or the great Tribulation!” For now the people looked at him Or guessed what would come after, And eyes that just before were dim With feeling danced with laughter. For no one yet had ever seen Or heard such pranks in fable, Or chapters out of Verdant Green— God's house turned into Babel. And, ah no labour had been spared To speed my ardent sermon, With blessings asked and points prepared And tears like dews of Hermon. But now I felt my savoury dish Could hardly even be tasted, And while the Devil got his wish My efforts must be wasted. Till after forty faithless years, I found my words were suited To one poor sinner's darksome fears, And in his life had fruited. IN THE COUNTRY. My dear Dolly, I sigh for the season And the joys that I fully have proved; But Papa, without semblance of reason, Has got gout and so cannot be moved. So I'm doing a budget of letters To my cronies and cousins in Town, Though I long for their glorious fetters— You should see my last lovely tea-gown! Here's the post! And that limp Lady Frances (You know wedded to Timothy White), At the length of three-volume romances, Has just written to say she can't write. And no news! Though a scatter-brain artist Has come down with his Socialist lies, Whom they once would have ducked as a Chartist Though he now has episcopal ties, And some Canons—for instance, old Sammy, With the Toynbee delights for all needs, And his lips that are rather too jammy With impossible sugar plum creeds. For their gospel is mere commissariat Rounded off by the larder and shelves, And to please the unwashed proletariat, They say Jesus was one of themselves! All is fun in the country, they fable, Who rejoice in the pleasures of Town; Yet there's little but styes and the stable, And the gossip they bring from the “Crown.” While the farmers, who, if it were raining Gold in showers would grumble for more, At the drought on the hills are complaining, As they calmly heap higher their store. There's the annual scare about rab-i-es, And the Councils are busy at play; But far better go mad than have bab-i-es, Like poor Lil, and with nothing to pay. While you flutter in silks and in satins, Scorning earth with fastidious toe, I'm addicted to worship and matins And a handsome new curate called “Joe.” Yes, my heart (if I have one) is fractured, With the feelings that fret under paint; Though my piety is manufactured, For the moment, to humour the saint. And the Doctor pronounces my ilium Has been damaged by tennis and strains, And his caution's severe peristylium Shuts me in to Tartarean pains. THE SHADDER OF GAWD. There's a Big Boss (but not pal) at Constantinopal, As I doant like to menshun who pays no attenshun To the truth, an jest wallers in fraud— An they stiles 'e the “Shadder of Gawd!” 'E as wives by the duzzins an unkills an cuzzins, An most illigant eunicks in bowstrings an tunicks, But delights in the beastliest bawd— An they stiles 'e the “Shadder of Gawd!” In orl as is nasty an d—d paderasty An with shebooks an pizen is bloomin orizen, Iz az sick az iz stummick with lawd— An they stiles 'e the “Shadder of Gawd!” Ah, 'e brekfusts on babbies an un-faithful cabbies An 'e sits at iz lunchin their marryboans crunchin, While good Christians fur dinner iz chaw'd— An they stiles 'e the “Shadder of Gawd!” But he aint got no 'atter an 'e doant get no fatter Fur iz pipes an iz coffee an sherbut an toffee, Though with brains iz fine progress be straw'd— An they stiles 'e the “Shadder of Gawd!” Not to justiss 'e arkins an iz jallussy darkins Earth an sky, an it follers the chappies with dollars Till their teeth an the money be draw'd— An they stiles e' the “Shadder of Gawd!” BUFO ANTIQUUS LOQUITUR. Here I embedded In the eternal rock Of I forget which d——d formation, Have seen the shredded Lands with earthquake shock, Pass for my private delectation. Palœolithic climes were chimes And moments in this gray existence, That surf-like on my bulwarks broke And iron resistence; The glacial ages were but pages, And part of one gigantic joke. Though systems fall, My thunderous laughter throbs through all. The air is diet And enough for me, In this convenient classic stratum; I love the quiet And a corner free, To muse on the last ultimatum— I count but idle tears and fears And waste of precious time and tissue, For philosophic souls whose zest Lives in the issue; And countries making ground or breaking Are different sides of the same jest, Each period brings Its humour in the heart of things. Man is a bubble To my periods pale, And whirled by every whim or motion, Like empty stubble Tost before the gale— He sinks the deeper from devotion. A serious view of life and strife, Just begs at once the total question— A charge that thoughtful minds would shun, And spoils digestion; For, in the splashes and the crashes Of worlds or puddles, there is fun. In murder's wiles, Behind her curtain Nature smiles. I sit unheeded And a power unknown, Who pull the puppet-strings of nations In ever-needed Change for weeds o'ergrown— The earthquakes are my cachinnations, The eclipse is but my frown and crown; And tempest voices are my talking, When I to pageants passing speak And set them walking— I love to shatter proudest matter, Or upon strength exalt the weak. I ply my task, The comedy beneath the mask. Men are but maggots To my endless years, And for their minute creep and burrow Or pile-up faggots Towards the fire that clears The rubbish in the final furrow. Œonian stars that glance and dance Or in their measured spaces twinkle, Are nothing to my hoary Eld Nor raise a wrinkle; Corruption's biting leaves no writing, On one whom bondage never held. Within my port Anchored, I make the world my sport. Down in earth's oven I preserve the flame Which keeps the great globe warm and living, And let no sloven Or idle wheel disturb my game— Each must be fuel if not giving. I hold the mighty reins and skeins Which seem to foolish fingers tangled, But are to me most lucid knots; Though noise is strangled By them, and tallness proved but smallness; I wind and unwind playful plots. The whole's intent, To thinkers is mere merriment. THE DEVIL IN PARLIAMENT. Ho, the Devil rose up, like Lord Coningtower's cup To his lips, with as graceful an attitude; And he dropped in to dine with Sir William at nine, In the midst of his prettiest platitude. He was modernised quite, and fresh painted all white, With an orchid of cost in his buttonhole, He had manners of mark, good enough for the park, And looked cool as the frigidest mutton-hole— From New Zealand, you guess—with an easy address, And a way that you could but call affable. In Church matters and State not a bit out of date, And with anecdotes pointed and laughable. Then the two (a sweet pair) with an innocent air, To the House toddled in for some oratory; There was Joseph in power with his eyeglass and flower, And the Premier from his Laboratory. Then the famous “First Whig,” half a Blue-book, half prig, Took his place with the others in Parliament; Though the brewers looked black, for he was on their track, And he knew all that d——d foreign barley meant. But he called himself now, with a Radical brow, A pure Socialist plunging in politics; For he followed that card of conceits by the yard, And the timepiece of party's new folly ticks. Ah, the Devil was apt with his reasons, and tapt Sweet quotations and took just the quiddity; He was gallant and good to Tim Healy, who stood On the “right of his private stupidity.” He had precedents ripe, and as pat as a stripe, For his service and all who were entering; Ready-made little saws, and most wonderful laws, Far ahead of the wildest Dissentering. He gave many a hint, not yet published in print, To the pets of his latest Democracy; And a sinister heat, for each ill-gotten seat Of his partners in gambling and Stock-cracy. But sometimes he would trail the least tip of his tail, Just to show himself still the old gentleman; With the tiniest whiff of the brimstone to sniff, Which encouraged his peaflour-and-lentil man. Till he started at last from a vision aghast, And upset dear Sir William's own suavity, While he tumbled down flat upon Morley's best hat— Hiding him in its awful concavity. Then he bolted apace from Lord Rupert's red face (Which he thought was the judgment fire beckoning), And his terrible nose like the trump of doom's close, But left William to pay for the reckoning. THE CONCERT OF EUROPE. March, 1897. The Frenchman tootles on his horn; The Kaiser beats the drum of scorn; The Tsar (who would annex the moon) Plays in the distance his bassoon; The Briton on a trumpet blares, And shudders at his Foreign Shares; The Austrian Emperor won't be mute, With variations on the flute; And Italy in sorrow sends With organ (but no dividends) A monkey and her Nicolo; While Turkey in the Concert strives And fiddles on her subjects' lives, Though Hellas pipes the piccolo. For all (remembering sweet per cents) Are playing different instruments To different tunes, in sharps and flats, Like thirty thousand squalling cats, With thirty thousand kettles tied Upon their tails—and thus allied. But from this harmony of fears And doubts that darken with the years, Which with hot shrapnel soon may shiver us, May God in mercy now deliver us. SECTION IV. Euphrasy and Rue. SOUL SENSE. A sense of something lost, a missing joy Comes to me often As I lightly toy With pleasure, or the uttermost fine fringe Of exquisite deep pain; I strangely soften And feel a touch, that may be even a twinge Like sorrow or the aftermath of grief Mature and mellow, Stirring me within Above the thought or wish of a relief. Is it some vanished fellow Or a fond Old playmate, who was close to me akin, In wider worlds most beautiful and fair; Whose memory haunts me from a bliss beyond, Like a calm crowned despair? It hardly troubles And yet it takes my heart, expands the sky That is the heaven of hope Unbounded in its majesty and scope, And sweetly doubles The meaning of our dim ambiguous life, To rapture joined and yet with suffering rife, And breathes through all my blood Eternity. What is it, The strong pull of Powers afar, Which upward draw Past yoke of earthly law My soul, and thus with no infrequent visit Then leave for me the golden gates ajar? But nothing clear, And nothing sound or certain Results, however sweet And dread and near The sense with sound of tinkling angel feet— Drops on the dawning sight a misty curtain. And I confess— Bear with my folly, brother— I have at times, what words cannot express, The feeling I am other Than my comrades here In mould and measure and aspiring heart, And do inhale a different atmosphere— A thing apart. It is not vulgar pride, Which lifts me up to glory's giddy tops And puffs my vanity, Or with idle sops Feeds me and fills me to a wild inanity— The world goes on its way, I stand aside. I have a hidden faith, A firm assurance Of higher steps and holier ancestry Above mere lineage royal and the wraith Of earth that lack endurance, And a birth That reaches out to all Infinity, Not spanned by any fortune's splendid girth. My fashion is not what it seems, A lot Deformed by many a narrow bound or blot And as my neighbour deems, But orbits vast With a grand Future and as grand a Past. I was pre-destined to a princely state, Perchance not here, but in a goodly land; To sit upon a throne And not alone, But with co-equals in a dazzling fate And the great custom of command. I know Within me, I was born for nothing less Than perfectness, Which now I cannot live In the pale shadow of the Truth below; I have a high prerogative And aim; Which in the fulness of the rounded times And richer climes, I shall in triumph claim. Meanwhile, these thoughts, that well nigh break my heart With passion more than love, Are a sweet witness Unto the precious title-deeds above, And my clear fitness For a wider part. MY BED. Mingled of dew and dreams and roses With all delightful scents, And married to delicious poses While broad as continents; Wrapt round with sweetest maiden kisses Like music to the ears, And on the edge of soft abysses That tremble into tears; O'erarched by whatso'er is good And calm and exquisite, The tender warmth of womanhood And patience infinite; Lapt in the love that dwells for ever In faithful hearts and wise, The bloom of beauty and endeavour Up to the starry skies; Cradled in shadows of the even And yet with morning rays, The best of earth, the most of heaven, And summer nights and days; Based firm on an eternal seat, A lotus land of rest, And swaying to the Kosmic beat As on a mother's breast. CRADLE SONG. Baby, rest, My baby blest! With your cooing, Sweetly wooing All the kindness and the care, Deeper than the deepest fountains, Higher than the highest mountains, Bodied in a mother's prayer. Never for the poor and prest, Did the strongest wall of iron With such perfect peace environ Souls, as does a mother's breast. Baby, rest, My baby blest! Baby, sleep In the watch that angels keep Gently round you, Who have wound you Safe from all besetting harms, Far above the reach of malice With its black and poisoned chalice, In the girdle of their arms. Why should Baby wake and weep, With the hosts of Light in legions Sent by God from heavenly regions, For the vigils which they keep? Baby, sleep In visions deep. WHAT IS LIFE? O what is life? We cannot tell, And none hath ever known The secret of God's crucible, By Nature made her own. And earth is weak, and cannot speak Whereof its seed was sown. O what is life? I asked the blade Of grass bepearled with dew, What dim laboratory made Its robe of emerald new. But all it said, as half afraid, Was that from Space it drew. O what is life? I asked the star Low in the evening sky, Which watched me sweetly and not far And sang a lullaby. But what its strain, enwound with pain, Abides a mystery. O what is life? I asked my heart, Which fluttered as I spoke; What gave created things the start, Whence man at length awoke. And what I yearned so far, I learned When it with rapture broke. CUCKOO. Sweet cuckoo bird! Sweet cuckoo bird! You and the spirit Joy are twain, And I who echo you am third With my refrain. For in the murmur of your throat Are wells of laughter, And in the shadow of your coat The shine hereafter. That breast is bursting with the glee, Which shakes the oaring of your wing; You voyage over town and tree, Embodied spring. Sweet cuckoo bird! Sweet cuckoo bird! No wicked hand could wreak you wrong, Who are the Maker's flying Word— Incarnate Song. You bring us with that fresher cry A new affection, And out of gray Eternity Green resurrection. Before you iron winter, hung With crusted frost and cruel death, Flees at the glory of your young Diviner breath. Sweet cuckoo bird! Sweet cuckoo bird! Old continents, all broad and bright With endless summer, grace and gird Your verdant flight. Right down the ages, as they roll For you to capture With strains that stifle their dark toll, Rings out your rapture; As if across the swell and sweep Of nations while they rise and fall, We heard arousing lands from sleep An angel's call. Sweet cuckoo bird! Sweet cuckoo bird! You utter what we do conceal, And every human heart is stirr'd By that appeal. The heavens are bluer for your gay Glad inspiration, You scatter jewels on your way— More revelation. O happy herald, as you fly, We see in quickening corn and clod The marriage of the earth and sky, And man and God. ETERNAL CORRESPONDENCE. Ah, one by one these fetters as they break Though soft as silk and precious as the gold And sweet as heart-strings, yet are fetters still, Which bind me to the earth I have outlived And all outgrown. My spirit frets within, It chafes at even the very charms of life And feels the angel wings, that gently flutter For larger circuits and serener air, And fain would rise and spread themselves abroad On wider and undreamed of spaces. Time Drops from me like a garment old, moth-eaten, And far too small for this consuming fire Which thirsts and thirsts for full eternity And cannot, will not be assuaged with less. Flesh is a burden and a bondage now, And not as erst a proud empalacement With avenues of joy on every side Expanding freely to whate'er is good, And letting in the gladsome influences Which make and shake to beautiful fine form The world within to be the world without But more. I weary of this anchorage And restless roadstead, and I would unmoor My sense-bound soul and voyage out alone Into the awful silences. I see, I know the waxing wonderment of things, And long to rend the coloured veil that dazzles But yet deludes not with mysteriousness A steadfast faith, and errs not from defect But its excess of vision and vast light. I am the sport of dim disharmonies Here, and I darkly reach towards realms above, Beyond, outside this murky mortal state Now, till I win the fair enfranchisements Of bliss and being somehow fixed for me And somewhere, past the idle mocking mists On these gray shores with their unsheltered harbours. And surely each strange appetency strong, Which stirs the mind and in the haunted heart Beats out low music, is a certain sign And murmur of a real foreshadowing Of richer dreams and rarer destinies, In final blossom of the act and fact. I do believe—I will be sure of this— Our noblest feelings do not trick or thwart The pilgrim bound and battling for the Truth, With girded mind and staff of stout resolve, And like to like must correspond for ever. THE THEOTEKTONES. Delay me not, nor ban me, as I build— Who work for nothing less than for all time, As one (though most unworthy) of the Guild And goodly craftsmen sealed through every clime, The separate holy Makers. We are few But strong and steadfast, and our work is one; To fashion Him we name with awed dim breath, Heart of our life and hidden Soul of death With sweetest loveliest things, the fire and dew And thought that into deed could not be done But yet is vaster; thus to lift Him high, Embodied in our prayer and praise, and clothed With dazzling terror bitted and brought nigh As to a natural consuetude of calm, Among rich bounties in their region blest. To this we labour, plucking out of storm The beautiful dear bosom of white rest, And rapture bred of sorrow and betrothed To silence. From the passion of the palm, Which out of ashes climbs to fairer form We borrow bloom and resurrection dress, With shyness of the evening shadows draped, And by the touch of tears and magic shaped Of light and love to everlastingness. For He, of whom we speak with reverent song, Hath for the world no outwardness of aim Nor might nor meaning, till the arms that can Externalize (if by imperfect plan) The Truth with which the earth has travailed long, And cast in statued strength its righteous claim; Or paint by pictures of unfading hue Guesses of one that flowers in rose and rue. There is no God for men, unless we make Him breathe and move and burn beneath the glow Of urgent hands, that kindle and compel To visible and varied substance. We Conflict with giant forces that rebel Idly, and earthquake shocks arise and shake Not the clear purpose in its tidal flow, To set the Prisoner of the Ages free For act and utterance. Taught in different schools The same grand lesson, we are only tools To raise the lid which coffins as with doubt The jewel swathed in sweetest mystery And noontide night of old Eternity, Till art unriddling lets the secret out. So we Theourgoi toil and watch and weep, Each at his post and with anointed part In every land and time, to body Him Who but for us would in eternal sleep Lie as a fountain frozen at the heart, And never wake and overflow its brim. We make Him live, the Beautiful, the Best, And draw from secret wells the murmuring stream Which winds about the bases of all things And yields the sap by which they flower and fruit; We upward raise, till it is manifest And robed in radiance, the inspiring dream Above these baubles and the vulgar bruit Of animal pleasures and vain perishings, The clue in clouds. The maskèd miracle, Below the tricksy surface of our stage; Implicit even in mire that splashes up And is to seers an hourly parable, A rainbowed wonder and a haunting hope; We do reveal, and read the blotted page Writ in the legend of the carven cup, The ampler duty and abounding scope. A thousand thousand veils are on the Light, The luminous Darkness, many an ancient scroll And mighty script of bard, or fearful fane August, and periods like a weather vane That left at least some promise in their flight; And we, by solemn symbols, do unroll Farther and farther the tremendous Truth Which lends the Kosmos its perpetual youth. O here and there and everywhere the Fact Lurks, for the eyes that have a loftier look And piece from fancy or phenomenon Or broken words or antique vessel crackt, Now measured pomp of some poetic book, Now marvels in a pillared Parthenon; And in them each a broader earth and sky, With the dread Presence of Divinity. Behold! ye that enjoy the Vision pure If but a fragment of its vastness, how The grandeur of the Ineffable is mixed With melody in all our mortal stuff, Immortal, and is the one gift secure; That cannot be unfashioned or unfixed, And chimes in answer to the changeless vow Sweet balm as medicine to man's brute rebuff. And we the Master Builders, south and north, By scattered rays and gems converging still And with the same white clear unswerving will Create the God we darkly utter forth. And generations yet unborn shall reap Of the rich harvest which we may not taste And riot in its glorious wealth, or waste The golden ears and count the blessing cheap; While children's children, entering in of right, Do dwell beneath the Shadow that is Light. THE GOD-MAKERS. It may be by us mortals, Who suffer long and sing, God is while dimly advertised And crownèd more as King, Yet through profounder portals Made conscious and Self-realised. And in each thought of greater girth Or brightness of broad fancies Dashed with a sweet undying dew, Or rapture of romances And truth for ever born anew, God too is coming to the Birth. It may be, by the Poet Equipt with sword of song, And only armed with Beauty's love To light the world along; Though he may never know it, Fresh heavens are breaking out above. And every little tender strain Which takes one thorn from roses And adds a petal or a hue, When sick the heart reposes; Must give to God a clearer clue, And to the mysteries of pain. IMPERIUM IN TABERNÂ. Yes, in that cottage there is empire too, Though now not written large, Nor given occasion by broad chance to woo That bitter sweet great charge; The high adventure awful, Wrapt in its licence lawful, To widen forth a sea without a marge. And on the rugged form Gnarled as by fire and storm, Sits something of the dreadful shape and shadow; If now mere sunshine warm And tan the face, grown rude on mount and meadow. The solemn burden of a separate fate And chrism of splendid joy, Asleep in him and yet uninchoate Or just an idle toy; Still lurk with deeds of daring In that unfinished bearing, That might be waked to some supreme employ. And while his English eyes Drink day of sober skies, If but by petty toil his day is rounded; He shares those destinies, Which make and shake the world with hopes unbounded. At times he has strange glimpses of his might And turns a folded page, He steps a moment into royal right And his own loftier stage; Himself he is the nation Built in the one foundation, And dowered at heart with that fine heritage. Down in his cloistered nook, Or strong with reaper's hook And brown arm that through gold and silver dashes, He feels the wide outlook And gets dim visions of imperial flashes. In him the pulse of a grand people chimes, And through his channeled veins The music of the old heroic times Beats at its curbing reins; Unconscious of his greatness And with a grim sedateness, He yet is clue to many knotted skeins. Though years go tranquil by, In his simplicity He is to all things noble truly wedded; While, in the mystery Of gray romance and living rock, embedded. UNLOVELY AGE. Unlovely Age, which makes dead things so fair, Dims these dark eyes and bleaches this brown hair That children fondled once and women chose To toy with, while the gallant careless pose Is gone for ever. Life, that bubbled out And leapt the giant walls of fear or doubt From overflowing fountains in me, strong, And set to music as a bridal song, Now freezes at its source. The joy, the spell Of youth that rose the higher if it fell, Sleeps on in sullen ashes with no fires Which could be kindled by long-dead desires. But I go on, as groping through a mist With blind uncertain feet, and do exist— To suffer. In each wrinkle of my brow Is buried some true love, or broken vow, Or unfulfilled grand resolution. Faith Dies hard and last, a dulled but glorious wraith. And yet, if this poor figure fail and bend, Is there no beauty in the evening end And hush and shadow? Is the dying day Less comely, with the glory of decay Than cold gray morning's pearls? And why should man Be all unpleasing in his faded plan And crumbling bonds of earth, and meet the eye With but defects of sere mortality Or death? I am a witness to the law Laid upon every creature, star or straw, And just fulfil my destiny and doom Of being; and as I have borne the bloom I now put on the garmenting of blight, A sad discrowned but not dishonoured sight To be re-cast in other worlds and made More fitting and desirable, from shade And long repose of Nature's night. I bow, Because I must and also choose, my brow That looks no more up to a kindred sky, Beneath the pale and iron Necessity. I pass a willing soul, and on my face Obedience sets its crown of kingly grace. DEATH AT THE HELM. The mad storm raved, the sturdy ship Went staggering on her way, And though she felt their cruel grip She kept the winds at bay. Like hungry hounds the wild waves broke Before they even came nigh; And, in a blinding blur of smoke, Up sprang the spray on high. But blasted by the lightning's bolt, With course that never veered And through a strife like hell's revolt, The stark cold pilot steered. The mist dropped down, no beacon mark Gleamed forth with friendly sign; While closer settled down the dark, Incumbent and malign. From night to deeper night she sped Within the rayless gloom, Dying and captured by the dead To her pre-destined doom. Unshaken by a thousand shocks And with the battle cheered, She drove stem-foremost to the rocks, And still the helmsman steered. HOW TO LIVE. I sat at a Sage's feet, As I questioned him how to live, Where the misty currents meet And all faiths are fugitive. But he puckered his awful brow, While a glance from the caverned eyes Made me listen and lower bow To the flash out of thunder skies. “There is only one way,” he said; “Do not sport on the ocean brink, But launch on it unafraid With your reason's helm—and Think.” I lay at a woman's feet, Still seeking the unfound Truth, As she swayed in her beauty sweet And the warm voluptuous youth. So I asked the secret still, How my task could be really wrought Of the dubious good and ill And the actions that led to nought. But she pouted her scarlet lips, And upraised a perfumed glove With her scornful finger tips— “O the answer is simple—Love.” Then I stood in the labouring throng As I darkened yet more the gloom, In the unequal fight with wrong To the same pre-destined doom. And I begged for a clear reply From the to lers who came and went, In their useless agony And the ruts incontinent. But they hardly checked their haste, While they harvested barren spoil For their children's idle waste, And the dull response was—“Toil.” So I knelt at the shadowed shrine In the columned courts of prayer, Where the stillness stung like wine And peace was the hidden stayer. Could it solve the enigma old In teaching me how to live, With no wisdom gained by gold But its pure prerogative? And the incense floated up Over dust where the groundlings lie, From the swinging censer cup, And the Silence echoed—“Die.” SYMPATHY. Let the prison barriers go Binding man to self and woe, Shame and sin; Take to-day and the to-morrow, With your brother's care and sorrow Kindly in; Make your own the pain unknown, Yet akin. The new order bids your border Burst its bars, Bringing near and shaping clear Sister stars. Let the bounding earth and sky In a larger charity Broaden out, And the weary souls that sicken Feel your fellow-pulses quicken Darksome doubt. Let their grief find your relief, Wrapt about; Till the bitter lot seems fitter, And prepared For despite, and nothing quite All unshared. TO MY FUTURE JUDGES. To those I write across the ages, Armed with the wisdom of the sages And stronger man; The brighter for each vanquished fall, Equipt and ripe and rich with all The spirit can. To thee, not curbed with bit and bridling And soothed with sops of sugared idling, O fairer woman Divinely human; I offer this, who fain would kiss Thy red lips over the abyss. From gutter scribes and bloodless clerics Like females writhing in hysterics And ordered lies, Whose faith no deeper is than skin And never was in spite of thin Mock agonies; I turn to breadth of ocean air And thought that climbs a starry stair With love for leaven, To mix with Heaven— The soul that mates with larger hates, And lore of suffering's high estates. I send you here a brother's greetings, Beyond the mummeries and meetings Of shrouds and shrines; I give this blossom of a book, Thee ye may reverent read and look Betwixt the lines. Above our muddy streams of trust, And eddies of a pious dust Which folly raises With mutual praises; Though envy rasp, your broader grasp Shall open every seal and clasp. And at the bar of better knowledge, A wider court, a grander college Than any here; I stand for judgment, in the light That cannot err, and past our night And narrow sphere. O ye will keep from cruel shame That precious charge, a Poet's name, When realms have rotted, Unspent, unspotted; To gladden age and every stage O life, a joy and heritage. FOX HUNTING. It is O the pink jacket, the fox is away! And with rushing and racket and scorn of delay We must find him, and follow (by hill and through hollow) Our best without rest—he has led us astray. Ha, the hounds are not sleeping, their bellies that pass With a swish and a sweeping dash dew from the grass; With a smother of dust, stretching out in the lust Of their passion to kill, Long and sinewed and lean, going fast, going clean; With their sterns all upstanding and stiff, no commanding— One tempest of will! Noses down, see them tearing stem on, white and black— While the Whips do the swearing,—Ah dead on the track. And the mob of mere lubbers who fancy they ride, But will soon get good rubbers to peel off their pride! For the pace runs too hotly to please things so motley, Who trail in a tail and like sacks all astride, There is emptied a saddle, and souse for the ditch! While the owner may paddle home, glad of the hitch Which has held man and steed from a crueler need And the bitterest end; Safer both in the stall, and preserved by the fall; And if hard words are spoken, no limbs have been broken— Collapse is a friend. And far better such courses that part for a day, Than the dirty divorces that law sends to stay. It is hurry and hustle, the boot and the spur, With a burst and a bustle to catch the red fur! For the strongest will stumble, the Master may tumble And stones break our bones—but we do not demur. O the beautiful horses, each colour and kind, Fire incarnate, and forces as fleet as the wind! Loose the reins, give them head, for the haunches to spread And the legs get their reach. Tally ho! This is life sweet as battle's own strife, If at times is a blunder and somebody under— One fortune to each! If you spill, sir, your nieces (the right girls to wed) Will yet pick up the pieces—unless they are ahead. It's the madness of motion, the splendour of speed; And the doctor's best potion is nothing in need, When the system is ailing, to glorious sailing On turf like the surf and a fox-hunter's creed. Why, the first is a lady—God bless her blue eyes!— And the next is O'Grady; by Jove, how he flies! But his language were best not repeated, if guessed— He is Irish, you know. There's a cropper for one, and most handsomely done! Now he's up, Major Billy, not hurt nor his filly— They make a grand show. It is saddle and bridle, the stirrup and steel, And none care to be idle but cowards at heel. There's our reverend Parson, a wonderful weight, With his face flaming arson and no Sunday freight, Taking bullfinch and fences—without false pretences, And sure and secure—as his sermons—and straight! He sits down and is steady and true as the Church And for anything ready, howe'er he may lurch. But his brother, whose pipe is more lov'd if less ripe In a different sphere, I discern not—his taste runs to words and to waste; And our friend, Little Zion, that roars like a lion At home, is not here. Across fallows and hedges the Rector rides true, Sharpening wits and their edges, and gets all his due. It is O the pink jacket, the Fox is awake, With a goose in his packet he will not forsake; He's a hardened old sinner, but of his fat dinner We yet ere sunset with him soon must partake. This is fun, this is living twice over the day, And it's well worth the giving of pastime and pay; If the pleasure be short, it is certain and sport Of the merriest kind, Tally ho! see the brush, as we close with a rush And the wildest of whooping, hangs down its last drooping That draggles behind. Two or three of us in it—the white and the tan— Twenty years in a minute—a game for a man. TO MYSELF. O worse than record ever wrote, O better than best dreams! I hear each day a different note, And mark the secret subtlest mote In unarisen gleams. I lived with thee through rolling years, And shared the wildest faiths and fears Beside the wash of Cam; We tasted one sweet cup of tears, O lighter waif than foam or feather While built of granite rock and heather— Yet I a stranger am. Art thou an angel or a beast Or lower baser still, Compound of clay and not the least Of vice that makes a madman's feast— A demon gorged with ill? I know not, if companions tried Together we have loved and lied, In common beauty lapt; If we with daring front defied The laws of God and Man, though smitten— Thou art a dreadful book unwritten, A country now unmapt. What art thou? For I cannot tell, And hardly wish to see; I love both meat and matin bell, And half in Heaven and half in hell, With neither quite agree. I feel each hour a various mood, And have no settled form or food Beyond the moment's need; I honour Holy Church and Rood, The licence of the lustiest error Which gives me nought of joy or terror, And shift with every creed. What am I? Manifold or one? A channel for the tides, Whose changeful will in me is done That yet am wedded unto none, And open on all sides? I hate myself, and I adore This complex being, as before A travelled land untrod; And though I drift for evermore, I worship with one hand the Devil Who drags me to his woesome level And with the other God. THE SUN. Old pilgrim, architekton Sun, Rejoicing in thy strength to run That awful path of light and wrath, Since first the rolling earth begun! Ah, in that early cloud of fire, At once thy glory and attire, Was surely hid though tempest-rid The pulse of every pure desire; And this great Love, my Master's seat Built up of tears and flame and laughter, Felt in thee dim its primal beat— To make and break the worlds hereafter. The earth a thousand shapes has seen Ere putting on its garment green, And tide and storm the stately form Rocked out of shadow into sheen. But where was erst the burning belt And raging forces darkly dwelt, Or waters' waste made dreadful haste, Men long in cloisters calm have knelt. And in thy mighty mirror glassed, As thou did'st urge those endless travels, The generations rose and passed Mocked by thee for their idle ravels. But I if weak am older far Than thou or any orb or star, And was a thing past reckoning Before Creation owned its bar. My soul was ancient and yet young When fierce that fiery torch was swung, A sweltering globe of ruddy robe, And to its measured pathway clung. In thee I only changed my lot And stooped to tread on humbler stages, I flourished fair when thou wast not And lived with God for countless ages. And I possess, what none can give Those rays that must for œons live, My lamp shall shine in bliss Divine When thou art pale and fugitive. Though bright thy ministry and vast, Appointed is its bound at last; And thy sere grace and sickening face, Some day with fear will overcast. And when all crushed by conquering ill Thou dost for ever veil thy flashes, I shall be prouder fresher still And bend in pity on thy ashes. BREAKING NEW GROUND. I was bold and too ambitious And I yearned, If the years would be propitious As I laboured on and learned— This to do, what never men did, And to break new ground and splendid For the lands; Giving boons which none had earned, By the cunning of my hands. Not in me the thirst for laurels Woke, nor petty lust of quarrels, But invisible commands. So I sought the Sirens' places Swooning sweet, Where white blooms of breasts and graces Soft of rare and rhythmic feet Wooed me, and in accents crisper Waves with low caressing whisper Washed the shore. Arms were opened mad to meet Mine, and teach me tender lore; But the scarlet lips and clinging Raptures dear as dew and singing, Seemed a tale I knew before. Then of seas and earth a trial And a test, Did I make with sore denial Yielding up the bright and best; Searching both, the hall and hovel, Caverns blue and green for novel Treasure fair. And I pushed my solemn quest, Through the temples of the air. But I found it not in ocean, Height or deep, or pure devotion And the crimson altar stair. Next into the night I wandered Lone and late, Grudging nought, and still I squandered Love and life within its gate; Hoping, in those dusky sources, Thus to find un-dreamed of forces There enwrapt. Much I ventured too with Fate, Fronting barriers yet unsapt. But, though I encountered peril, Little came from pasture sterile Of those circuits never mapt. Oft of children sage and simple Asking aid I would learn, and from the dimple Of some innocent shy maid; While their frank and sudden questions Brought me infinite suggestions Dim as dawn. Yes, I sometimes waxed afraid, At the wisdom from them drawn. But I missed the secret magic, And my soul by stages tragic Seemed a losing player's pawn. Lastly, tired of useless living Off I went, From the maze of old misgiving To the bourne in shadow pent, And the silence of that city Sunk beneath the hope and pity Which men crave; And in this poor body rent, Found the knowledge that could save. And new ground, where love was lying, Out of dust and from its dying Broke in blossom from my grave. CHARACTER. Mix in bath of burning tears Iron front and glorious fears, With the splendour of the tender Buds from green enfranchised years; Steep them greatly, steep them long In the perfume of all song, Circled deep with visioned sleep And a deathless hate of wrong. Take the passion of the storm And its fulness white and warm, For the shaking and the making Of the man to perfect form. Grit of granite, maiden bloom From the lily's magic loom Seize, and mingle in a single Strength that rises over doom; Blend the secret love, that saith Peace, with victory of faith Giving flesh and blood afresh To the creed's departing wraith; Let some note of native mire Mate with robe of regal tire, For the draping and the shaping Of the spirit in the fire. Link, with shadow and the sheen, Lights of land and ocean seen Through the vista of genista Avenues of gold and green; Weave the vastness of the sky And the wings that upward fly, With the sweet of kisses fleet And the soul of purity; Plunge the whole in purple air Of wide spaces free and fair, Down the roaring surge, up soaring Steps that build God's altar stair. Match with loneness of the mount And the laugh of silver fount, Breast of woman, care for human Things whatever be the count; Join to gentlest touch of hand Grip of more than brazen band, Wed the dew of promise new With the custom of command; Round the picture with the frame Of the high and holy Name, While you borrow bliss of sorrow And from flowers their heart of flame. MY CHILTERN HOME. My Chiltern home comes back to me, With slopes and summits fair; I hear the far winds talking, I see the dear birds walking As though their movements were more free Upon the paths of air. The stately house that hidden lies, Embosomed in its green; As if it were a portal, To palaces immortal; That claims communion with the skies, And mysteries unseen. The swallow, scribbled like a flake Of lightning on the blue; The roses whither flocking Brown bees would go a-rocking; The butterflies, too wide awake To tell their fleeting hue. Our sentinel the Scottish fir, In sunset soaked and warm; The murmur of the beeches, In wise dim woodland speeches; The owl, that is at eve astir, A shy and shadowy form. The coppice, whence the squirrel peeps In curious furtive play; With oak and hazel rustling And busy creatures bustling In shadows, where the linnet cheeps Its little life away. And in the Spring a carpet laid Light as the driven snow, Most wonderful and whiter; As if some maiden writer Had scattered thus, though half afraid, Her thoughts like heaven below. And from the margin of the lawn, The purple distances; And counties nigh a dozen, Whose beauty well nigh cozen An angel from his endless dawn With earthly images. And then the curtain of the night Above the flowers, that nod In fairy neatness folded; And with their rest re-moulded Of dew and stillness and delight, By the most gentle God. LIBER PUDORIS. Ever the darkening years bring me their cruel count Written in fire and tears, wrung from a lawless fount, Wrought on the sinful mount—sins that I cannot name; Marking in strife the Book of Life, which is the Book of Shame. Whether I toil or rest, moulded by feast or fight, Pillowed on woman's breast, lost in the awful night, Shuddering into light, shaped by the trial flame; Cometh like breath the Book of Death, which is the Book of Shame. Groweth in youth and age fashioned of woe and weal Deeper the dusky page on to the solemn seal, Past beyond powers that heal even the sick and lame; Forming in strife the Book of Life, which is the Book of Shame. Whether I heed or not, rise like a muddy spring Blur upon blur and spot, curses that stain and cling, Black for the reckoning held at the Bar of Blame; Heating like breath the Book of Death, which is the Book of Shame. Burning as want and wine, threatening, thwart and dim, Broadens the damning line out of each idle whim— Out of each error grim, right to the finished frame Clasping in strife the Book of Life, which is the Book of Shame. TO THE LATE JAMES ASHCROFT NOBLE. Large-minded sage, whose just and generous pen Wrote in its breadth and touch incisive nought That should have been unwritten and unwrought, Or was hall-marked (if uttered oft) till then; Thou sittest now for ever among men, An equal of the sweetest hearts that sought God's Truth on lines of the eternal thought Which breaks like Light on far untravelled ken. Poet, and critic foremost of our time To catch the note of that serener chime, Amid the pulse and babblement of pain And empty strivings after knowledge vain; O in the shiftings of each creed and clime, What thou hast said need ne'er be said again. THE DUKE OF ARGYLL, K.G., K.T. Argyll, the humblest of the Poets brings One tiny leaf of laurel for thy head; For thou hast walked, with no unequal tread, Those glorious circuits higher than a King's. Thy faith hath solved the secret heart of things, Which none by naked reason's clue have read; And tracked through Nature's night, the golden thread That is God's path with awful communings. Great Thinker, whom the careless world doth yet Not honour in thy measure as it ought, Thou hast for future generations wrought; New systems shall rise up, old systems set While thine endures, nor is there coronet So dazzling as thy crown of deathless thought. TO THE REV. T. E. BROWN, late FELLOW OF ORIEL. Thy years have yet the youthful heart of hope, Thy frost burns with a soul of singing flame, Olympic man of light, whom none can name Except with honour and its larger scope! Thy foot is high and sure upon the slope Leading the Few to that eternal Fame Set round its jewels with a storied frame, And pure and lofty as the heaven's blue cope. Thy words of wisdom, linked to the true strain Which moves in music but is more than pain, Compel my breast to beat in tune with thine; And those deep thunder-throbs, in shade and shine, Are what the Powers we serve do pre-ordain— One with the Cosmic harmonies Divine. SIR EDWIN ARNOLD. O sweet magician, at whose touch of light The golden East gave up its secret store, The wisdom of the ages, and the lore Revealed to souls that do not walk by sight; Thy brow with all that vision yet is bright, Thy lips drop jewels and the better ore Bequeathed by Masters who have sung before, And left like stars their footsteps through the night. Thy larger hope sees God unveiled in man, Eternity in hearts, space in a span, And Heaven betwixt the harvest and the seed; Thorns blossom at thy breath, the humble weed Becomes a precious ruby in thy plan, Which hails a glory in the darkest creed. IN MY LIBRARY. I dwell among my people, all my own, And commune with them in a speech unknown To others, woven of faiths and pleasant fears And crimson kisses and the joy of tears, With murmur as of wind that dies and drops In passing music on the pine-tree tops To play a moment as a harper might, And surf of distant seas on lands of light That wash white feet of maidens, and the sound Of wings that follow what is never found; Familiar to the wraiths that rise and flee At morning, and to butterfly and bee Like splashes of bright colours on the flowers, And whispered by the yellow-lichened towers That seem to prop (as centuries go by) The heavens and rooted in Eternity; Talked by the ripples of the running brooks That laugh and weep, but not in science books Though read betwixt the lines, and heard at night By poet ears when song melts into sight. The dear old volumes are to me most fair, Some gallant knights and some with golden hair And all my comrades, living and not dead In silks or harness clanging as they tread. The dust of ages goes, the stains are stars Of beauty, and the walls no longer bars Burst into space and blossom through all Time And mingle every stage and every clime. They come to me at eve from haunted shade With lisp of satin or in crisp brocade Of costly stuffs, and rustle as they go Their stately circuits, through the gloom and glow Of dusk and firelight; tall untroubled Queens Majestic step from depths of silver screens, And move to slow and secret melody; Then visored forms tramp from the tapestry In armoured death, and splendid with their spears, Red from the glory of undying years. I hear the clash of conflict far away, As if all buried hosts made holiday Of battle, upon sad and sullen moors, And struggle foot to foot; till dreadful doors Of dungeons, black and bottomless, shut in The hurly-burly and the hell and sin. Then pretty Baby Innocents, with eyes Of wonderment that open as the skies Poems of blue, run as from radiant bowers And sport and flutter off in light and flowers, But leave the perfume of their presence. Next A prophet broad and grim, with blood as text, The stormy petrel of his age, leans out With testifying hands and hurls a shout Of wrath and thunder down the tide of time And disappears in blood, sole and sublime. Here forth from ancient chivalry's gray tome Troop revellers, and crowd the castled home With mirth and madness and the wealth of wine; The torches flare, the brows of beauty shine Pre-eminent, and yellow locks and brown And sworded doublet and bepearlèd gown Mix in the strife of joy. The jewelled wrist And belted waist pass, in a sudden mist Of morning. Figures too of fiction start From populous deep shelves and walls of art, More delicate than life, exceeding fair With voice of laughing waters and proud hair Of moonlit darkness in which day and night Perfected meet and for the victory fight In vain. Old realms of magic and romance Give up each scene and solemn circumstance Of riot and of rapture yet to be, Evolved in cunning pageantries for me Alone; the pictured face in pomp and flame And shadow leaves the shelter of its frame Wrought curiously and well, and paces bright And conquering yet in music from the sight, But casting back shy Parthian shafts of love, A rose of red, the glimmer of a glove For tournament. The statue from its niche Steps down, and robed with many memories rich Discourses of the dead heroic times That are not dead and wake a thousand chimes Of slumbering grandeurs, crown and judgment rod, When men were nearer Heaven and walked with God. The bust of Shakspeare moves, the mighty brow Descends again to earth and to the vow Of homage uttered by my heart, and sends Deep rolling music to the utmost ends Of thought and passion, words that breathe and burn Whereon the axles of all Nature turn. And not unequal from his carven rest Consenting too, most beautiful and blest Milton with step magnificent and strong Outpours his heart in one great sea of song, And bids the darkness bloom in elder skies Of heathen faiths and hoar cosmogonies. Till as I gaze and dream the books depart And in their stead unnumbered forms upstart, Civilisations dead, and dying some, And whiter graces of the worlds to come THE CENTENARIAN. Ut puto deus fio. To-day I tell my century of years, With mind still verdant and the fount of tears Still bubbling up in sweeter waves than wine, And plenitude of human joy Divine; For yet my heart is young, my bosom beats With piston pulses and the fiery heats Of everlasting summer, as if here Within me was the centre of the Sphere And I gave out the passion and the strife, Which are the curtains of this clouded life And tell us nothing of the star or clod, Or of ourselves—if we are man or God. But, as beyond the babble of each sect And system, in a solemn retrospect I now look back and weigh departed joys And greatnesses, they seem but tiny toys As of a moment, and the golden gain Looks from this vantage-ground a cheat and stain Across the staring record, and the skies That lured me on were veils and vanities, And I alone the real. And, as I guess, Who cannot know, the world were emptiness But for the sorrow and the crownèd sin; And the Divinity is all within. ORPHEUS. Our hearts no longer hear the chimes Of the old stirring strain, And in these prosy modern times Sweet Orpheus sings in vain. For no one courts the gentle sound, Though it shall ever last, Which made all earth the holy ground In the dear golden Past. Our ears are deaf with other notes That drown the highest dreams, Our eyes see nothing but the motes Within the brightest beams. And while our Orpheus lingers on With the same lovely voice And haunts each broken Parthenon, Who now in him rejoice? Though moving is his magic yet As it has always been, Our souls to baser tunes are set, He walks and sings unseen. Another lyrist in his stead Has come and cannot save, Whose playing only lulls the dead More deeply in their grave. The wooden head and flinty heart Retain their narrow pride, Contracted more by vulgar art, And stocks and stones abide. The modern jangler feels no call From reverend fane or mount, The tavern and the music-hall Supply his muddy fount. He makes no living fair and free By loftier aim or ode, And pipes the lost Eurydice Down to the Dark Abode. He never soars above the clod Nor drinks of Nature's well, The scalpel is his bloody God, He has no heaven but hell. He pays no heed to solemn laws, Lets nothing sacred rest, And inspiration cheaply draws From his own sordid breast. He dances naked round the Ark Of evil to his shame, And leaves on all the lurid mark That is his chosen fame. He bids the groundling be content And hug his native mire, Reveals the spots of man's descent Or veils the heavenly fire. He catches not from wave or wood One ray of old romance, Denies all visions great and good And crowns our ignorance. He shows us that mere matter rules, Howe'er with graces girt, Reducing mind to molecules And deifies the dirt. And still his tuneless ditties fall On ghastly lives and gray, And the Divinity in all To him is common clay. The reek of brothels and of slums Pervades his broadest flight, With discords as of heathen drums From worse than heathen night. He rifles graves for grimy stores Instead of gardens fresh, Parades the leper's loathsome sores And tyrannies of flesh. And still his dull and droning airs Transforming men to beasts, Are heard in Mammon's lying lairs And hiccoughed at strange feasts. While our true Orpheus travels forth Where Dryads are at play, An outcast in this iron North He sings his heart away. He loiters by the lilied brim Of meres, that gather up All legendary glories dim, And bathe the buttercup. A touch of something more than art, A glimpse of bluer sky, A homeless murmur in the heart, Tell he is passing by. And sometimes on the ancient walls He hangs a ballad bright, And on enchanted ruins falls His shadow that is light. And from the cloister comes his sigh When temptings round us close, And brings the breath of Nature nigh As perfume to the rose. But no one listens to his lute Which bears a better plan, And only may when lust is mute Interpret God to man. THE MAKING OF WOMAN. Tears for the making of woman tender and warm and sweet, Rich with the rose of the human passion a-pulse in her feet; Mist from the virgin mountains solemn and far and white, Murmur of musical fountains drawn from the Infinite; Fire from the forge of the crater grim where the Cyclopes grind Worlds for the worlds' Creator, marble instinct with mind; Snow of the awful summits hidden on holy ground, Pearls out of deeps that plummets never on earth could sound; Scarlet and gold past measure painted on hair and flesh, Madness and mirth and pleasure loathed and pursued afresh; Colour of sunset petal veiled under mocking morn, Hardness of heated metal polished, and point of thorn; Strength of a more than giant dreadful to dare and wreak Vengeance, and unreliant helplessness worse than weak; Breath of the boundless ocean mixed with the cloistered air, Rapture of crowned devotion, taint from the leper's lair; Effort of flame aspiring up in the heaven of trust, Purity's power untiring thrilled with the harlot's lust; Spreading of love as spacious columns from flowering plinth, Clinging of hope as gracious blue to the hyacinth; This was the making of woman, wonderful, shyly shod, Clothed with a garment human, bearing the lamp of God. Blossom of benedictions happily wooed and won, Sum of all contradictions, treasures for each and none; Wisdom of reverend sages, grace with no mortal spell, Riddle of endless ages fashioned of heaven and hell; Silence of secret places green where the violet grows, Waft of the wind's embraces, light as where water flows; Joy of the tree that wrestles long with the winter blast, Bliss of a babe that nestles safe on the breast at last; Terrible boon of sorrow strewing with stones its way, Promise of brighter morrow, bud of the dim to-day; Faith with its upturned vision opening the very sky, Fear and its dark derision dumb as Eternity; Curve of the lily's shoulder washed in the pale moonshine, Ashes that as they smoulder rush into rays divine; Perfume of spices vagrant over a summer sea, Kiss of destruction fragrant yet with its sinful plea; Mould of a larger station, might like a conquering storm, Lines of a revelation writ on a rebel form; This was the making of woman dainty and pure in plan, Robed in her pity human, bearing the curse of man. THE MAKING OF MAN. Glory of blood and iron purpose to dare and do, Arms that outreach and environ earth and in tempest woo; Vision of soaring eagle over the tide and town, Sense of the homing beagle tracking its victim down; Speech that goes out in thunder leaping from mouth to mind, Knowledge a broken wonder leaving no bounds behind; Ears that are ever itching most for delight of lust, Fingers of famine stitching shrouds in decay and dust; Grit of œonian granite fashioned by fire and years, Patience as God began it builded on hopes and fears; Calm of a steadfast courage kindled by rocky bars, Seeking that finds its forage equal in stones and stars; Yearning for dreams and danger paths with adventure sown, Choice of the stern and stranger light and the night unknown: Pride with its paltry craving eager for empty chaff, Making its tomb and graving lies as its epitaph; Greed of a grand ambition preying on others' dearth, Half bliss and half perdition, good not for heaven or earth; Thus he arose the moulder, bearing the woman's fan, Blent of the clay and boulder—this was the making of man. Cruelty cold and measured out in a dreadful dole, Fat with a fuel treasured grimly for body and soul; Gladness that makes time younger buoyed upon wings to fly, Surfeit of all and hunger fed on Eternity; Baby content with trifles passing and bubble toys, Murderous grip of rifles belching in demon joys; Grasp that across the ages seizes and holds the flower, Tearing from crimson pages life and its deadly dower; Foot, that when troubles toss us rudely from town to tide, Steps a serene Colossus forward with stately stride; Breast like a bubbling river flowing in tears and flame, Dark with the shades that shiver down to a sea of shame; Selfishness woven as raiment meet for a little heart, Grudging of all repayment but the one damning dart; Force with its heel on weakness bleeding and crushed and torn, Fraud that devours the meekness linked and prepared for scorn; Love of the base, and leaven mixed of all mischief done, Meeting of earth and heaven married but never one; Thus he became the master bearing the woman's ban, Blessing, and dire disaster—this was the making of man. PARISH WILL PAY. Cart him along, He is commoner clay, Right way or wrong— Parish will pay; Hustle and bustle Through gutter and heap, Shake him or break him— Paupers are cheap; Over the crossings Tumble and tread,— Who cares for tossings? Up with the dead! Rector won't wait For rubbish as he, Mammon's his bait And golden the fee; Hurry and scurry, If Parson is fat Wheezing and sneezing The service all pat; Ah! he's a goer, When given his head Though such a blower— Long live the dead! Shovel him in And cover him up, Like the refuse his kin With the devil to sup; Pickings and lickings For maggots that lust, Ashes to ashes And dirt into dust; Kick him and trample Him low in his bed, Rot is the sample— Down with the dead! Canter away To the public and beer, Parish will pay For an Englishman's cheer; Clatter and chatter Of profit to reap, Smoking and joking, Paupers are cheap; Coffins are plenty And corpses our bread, We have quarters for twenty, Drink to the dead! THE CHILDREN OF THE CHILTERNS. It lies among the hollows of the hills And hears the music made by countless rills, As it has lain five hundred years and more And garnered human love and quiet lore, While listening to the same old simple tale Told by the trees or shouted by the gale; A story of the common use, that rounds The sober lives content in narrow bounds With homely joys and sad infrequent feasts, Or owns a kindly fellowship with beasts And birds and flowers which of one table share, Bound by familiar bonds and kindred care. No storms but those of winter strike the rest Of ages and the dulness all so blest, And fortunate in its obscurer lot; Outside the fever of the fight and plot And hurly-burly which uplift a State To glory, through the iron mills of Fate And fiery blasts of dreadful hope and doubt, On darksome forges slowly hammered out And hardly shaped by cruel shocks at length To the full measure of its final strength. Green Mossdale lies and sleeps and hears from far, As through some crevice or a gate ajar, Strange echoes dropping out of larger life In worlds of onset and heroic strife, And wakes awhile to visions and broad lists Of clashing arms and proud protagonists, But turns aside from that unwonted strain To its more welcome peace and sleep again, And mingles with the melody of streams Faint snatches of those wild forbidden dreams. Thus generations after others walk Along the same old path of even talk And work allotted as it was at first, Perform the daily task and quench their thirst Or break the fast and meekly at the close Without a murmur seek well-earned repose. Ambition never moves a single heart To spurn the yoke and play a spacious part, But on they drudge the one appointed way In the same ruts from which they cannot stray, Like their own cattle gently plodding still About the weary slope and up the hill, As tamely as their sires in frost and heat, And drone the same blind prayers and yet entreat The unknown God and yield to the old snare Brute-like, and little do and nothing dare. Mild are their sports and gray their festivals, And grim the gladness found in funerals That rouse from wounded breasts a creature cry At gloomy hours of sullen revelry. No fruitful thought with seeds of beauty rife May stir the stagnant bosom of their life And roll a pulse of passion through the days, As on they go their animal dumb ways And rise to work and sleeping rise once more To tread the dreary round they trod before And do their portion of determined care, Just as their fathers who for ages bare The same old burden with the same old brow And destined shoulders that in patience bow; And take the pittance hardly buying bread, Ill-clothed and poorly paid and badly fed, Repeating the blind errors of the Past And its blank aimless customs to the last, In the mild measured manner of the slave Who has no higher goal beyond the grave; And buy and sell and slowly eat and drink As kine that ruminate and cannot think, And drag along the same old iron chain Of habit void of pleasure as of pain, And dawdle through the dim unmeaning hours In vegetable fashion like their flowers— A starved unmoral fate, a stunted plight With common griefs and but their pigs' delight. At times a murder for a moment shakes The drowsy toiler, who just then awakes And rubs his rheumy eyes and nods his head Impervious, ere he seeks the narrow bed Of use and wont again and dodders on Deep in the track he has for ever gone, At heart unmoved by all that does not pinch His person, settled not to budge an inch Outside the ancient grooves wherein he plods; Who feels his kinship with the beasts and clods And fastens on the soil his lowly gaze, Nor knows one love to set his life ablaze. His children come and sprawl about the floor And bring the want that darkens oft his door, With that fierce fibre of unbroken will Which made our England great and keeps it still; Nursed by the bleak north-easter into force Bending the earth to its own conquering course And shaping empires out of shade and doom, Where once the spade that levels all finds room. And his the faith that never can grow old But quarries worlds, as in the times of gold When men like equals walked with God through death, In the grand days of great Elizabeth. A SEA-SHELL Oh, when I read the mystic shell, That makes a music in my blood Of every ancient shore and flood And wakens dreams I cannot tell, Within its storied bosom curl'd; I bathe within the founts that flow From the dim lands of Long-ago, And water all the living world. For in a solemn marriage sight That bridges time's remotest bound, And one with every sweetest sound That passes into love and light; And in old memories unfurl'd I bathe within the founts that flow From the dim lands of Long-ago, And water all the living world. From awful height and hidden deep And iron coast and tossing surge A thousand thousand waves converge To view from unremembered sleep, Without the thunders that they hurl'd; I bathe within the founts that flow From the dim lands of Long-ago, And water all the living world. MY OAK. O immemorial oak, that standest still As though a part of this old centuried hill, First sown when other stars were in the sky Root not of earth but of eternity; Thou art my comrade and my kin, thy state Is bound with me in one mysterious fate, Told by the furrows of Time's equal plough And iron rustling of each wrinkled bough Through which the garish rays can hardly shine, With leaves as awful as the Sibylline And intermurmurous airs in mid green gloom Burdened with woe and pendulous with doom. To me thou art no common growth, a thing That gives us shade or rests the raven's wing Furled for a season on that withered branch; But something far more human, if more staunch Than mortal men, who scarce with toil and tears Attain the measure of a hundred years In trembling want and weakness. Thou art yet Strong, though a thousand summers on thee set And kingdoms wove and then unwove fresh ties With races new and reverend dynasties. Yea, thou art history, England's and my own, And with our country hast to greatness grown A living portion of her mind and might And glorious with her mingled clouds and light, Firm with the fibre and the gallant grain Which made her sons indignant of all stain Indomitable; wrestling with the storm And fattening on its rage, thy giant form (When lesser stems of lighter stuff went by) Clomb to its crown and grand maturity Of mellow ease that is a sure defence, The seasoned pomp of its magnificence. Beneath thy dome of ages statesmen walked Serene, intent on high affairs, and talked Of empire and its conduct with calm brows That breathed eternal faith and solemn vows, And out of fancy into substance wrought Fair constitutions with imperial thought. Here came the clash of weaponed strife, when lords Had hotter blood and quicklier played with swords Than fence of speech, and noble blood was spilled; And here the sighs of silken lovers thrilled Thy dreadful shadows, and wild eyes were wet With passion and red lips betrothing met. The ravening Roman eagle and the Dane Who brought the scent of seas with battle bane, The Saxon wassail and the Norman pride All found a ready refuge at thy side, With wolf and boar and outlaws fiercer far, And left some fragrance or a scornful scar. Long generations here of childhood held Their pastimes from the splendid days of Eld, And sported in the shelter of thine arms Or slept a season, drinking rosier charms From commune with thy majesty. And here Enkindled with the generous atmosphere, The poet now takes comfort in thy powers, Renews his youth and puts forth other flowers Upon this storied ground, the citadel Of Time, where thou art set as sentinel And at the marriage of the earth and sky, The lonely outpost of Eternity. IN A CHURCHYARD. Some day here will be my final home, Under this dear dome Roofed with silver clouds and roses blue— Here my mortal due; Then this body with the thoughts that burn Surely will return, With its madness and its human mirth Earth unto the earth, With its hopes and fears and heavenly flashes Ashes unto ashes, With its glory and its simple trust Dust unto the dust. Funeral bells are ringing in my heart As I muse apart, Shadowed with the curtain that must fall Over me and all; Hark, with muffled measured beat they toll For the passing soul, Far away and deep within my breast Tuned to dim unrest! And the force and fulness of mere being Burst in sudden seeing, As with inward eyes and other strength I behold at length. Graves all open, and their tenants rise Now with radiant eyes And in reverend beauty as of old, From the crumbling mould; Old and young with kindly gestures come, And in splendour some Crowned with graces that no tongue can tell And a spirit spell; Hoary heads by trouble scarred and shaken In their ripeness taken, Golden girls with lips that blossom up Like a crimson cup. All renewed and glorified and fair With the early air Of our common fellowship and kin, But without the sin And the sorrow and the ills that fruit From that bitter root; All rejoicing in a conquering calm, Breath of holy balm; Baby forms about the churchyard patter On the flowers they scatter, And within my heart in happy swells Ring the marriage bells. THE LUTE OF LIFE. Came a singer with a message of a music in his heart And the passion of a presage which was his unstudied art, Only telling what was dwelling in the chambers of his breast To the buying and the selling and the people's wild unrest; As they struggled on and juggled with each other and the truth, And the baby dimly snuggled at the fountain head of youth. But the glory of his story lay like sunrise on his lips Dear to childhood and the hoary head that suffered sad eclipse; And on toiling dens of soiling dropped from every golden string Peace amid the spite and spoiling, just because he could but sing; For where'er awhile he tarried in the fever of the strife, With his loving hands he carried evermore the Lute of Life. Yet the tune he played was single in the sweetness and the plan, Though it seemed alike to mingle with the burden of each man; With the trouble that was double from the darkness of the end, And the fragile frame a bubble blown about and with no friend; With the finding and the binding or the loosing of the bond And the gaze that through the blinding mists could see no sky beyond; With the driven shame or shriven penitence that brake in bloom, And the murderer unforgiven tottering dumbly to his doom; With the idle hating bridle—led by any tyrant lust, And the crookèd souls that sidle and the straight unswerving trust; On the service fired by duty fell that comfort never stale, And the blemished got a beauty, and all drew a different tale. Every life, that dreamed or wrestled with despair, just heard its need Answered by the song that nestled in the bosom like a seed; For in broken hints or spoken words the melody was one, And its ministry a token of the joy denied to none; Thus the braving and the paving of the path, that climbed the slope Up to rest beyond the raving of the world, heard simple hope; And the leisure without measure, in its soft voluptuous coil, Heard a higher strain of pleasure with the majesty of toil; And the stayer or delayer in the valley doubting still, Heard the humble breath of prayer as a medicine for his ill; Every lot, that beamed or darkened in the shadow or the shrine, Heard the truth for which it hearkened and with love was made divine. A SOLITARY SEA. The sun comes up, the sun goes down, The wild wind makes a song, The sky is one great iron frown, And yet I drift along. No sight of one familiar change, No glimpse of gallant ship, No resting in the awful range, No sound of fellowship. The sullen waters are my throne Of torment as in hell, While forth I ever drift along On the dumb dreadful swell. The sun goes down, the sun comes up But doth not hear my plea, And with its red and angry cup It drinks the bitter sea. No bird is in the boding air, No creature in the deep, A horror bleaches even my hair And racks my haunted sleep. About the awful waste I toss, Beneath a scornful sky, And every moment is a cross Of mute eternity. The sun comes up, the sun goes down, And one are day and night, The curse of silence is my crown, The darkness is my light. The broken surge on which I hang Is like a living death, But not so cruel as the pang Of each undying breath. Over the unmapt sea I drive Unmarked by friend or foe, And when I would not still survive— A solitary woe. The sun goes down, the sun comes up And fear with probing dart Comes in its savage glee to sup Upon my haunted heart. No vision of a friendly sail, No shimmer of a shoal, I pass (and hear no pilot hail) A pilgrim without goal. My ocean has no bar or bound, And I possess no chart Except the solemn ceaseless round Of terror in my heart. The sun comes up, the sun goes down And one are night and day, I cannot die, I may not drown, I only ebb away. I merely know that I must drift Through endless weary space, And shadows that will never shift, But find no resting place. Around a shoreless world of waves On every side I see, And all are grim and hungry graves But none alas! for me. The sun goes down, the sun comes up, Sometimes the sea is still, But fear forbidding me to stop Grinds in its fiery mill. The wind that rises with the sun At evening will be gone, And every life at last is done, But I go sailing on. A tortured part of wave and wind I must for ever sweep With them in bondage deaf and blind, Across a homeless deep. ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS. Ah, if I only could create The tiniest house of song, To be a part of earth's estate And with it roll along; If I could forge one living line Of woman's love and flame divine To be a beacon ever, And shoot its glory through the shade Of time, when suns and systems fade, By true and grand endeavour; Then I would gladly yield my breath And break this mortal tie, And find deliciousness in death But yet not wholly die. And thus I weary night and day, To build a sacred cell Wherein Divinity's bright ray May take delight to dwell; A snare to catch the passing God Who shines alike on cloud and clod, To keep His Grace in prison; That there may be perpetual morn, When our poor kingdoms are outworn And worlds have set and risen; I frame my very bone and flesh And all this beating heart, Each day in some new work afresh That flowers from loving art. Ah, if I only could just light A lamp of holy oil, To shine when man has taken flight And done his little toil; If but a glowworm in the gloom To stay one pilgrim step from doom When strayed or darkly driven, A beam across the trackless deep Where sufferers watch and mourners weep, To save a soul unshriven; Then all these fifty years of pain Whence I could never reap, Though tenfold were not sown in vain And every cross were cheap. And thus a purpose as of fire Burns through each borrowed mask, Consuming me with vast desire To make a perfect task; To leave behind me something fair, If on the great white altar stair A stone of modest meetness And nothing more, yet in its place As needful as the grandest grace And one with that completeness; From magic founts I drink my fill, I take from Orient marts, And rise as by a ladder still Upon my broken parts. HOMESPUN. I will not cull from any neighbour's Garden bright and green, The tiniest bud that by his labours Laughs in goodly sheen; I will not gather one least blade That breathes in sunshine or in shade, And sweetly throws The perfume which it never misses Around us like impassioned kisses, As it glows; I love the harvest of my toil, If grown on surly English soil. It may be meaner crops and humble Flowers from simple seed, Or stones where careless footsteps stumble In the wilding weed; But howsoe'er the borders look In many a pale and pensive nook Or homely line, Though rough the ground and rank with thistles And horrid thorn that ramps and bristles, They are mine; And if it be but little known Or honoured, it is all my own. I will not steal the mincing measures And the tinkling tones By others framed, for the true treasures Which my breast enthrones; My numbers may wear lowly 'tire, But yet they have the English fire And sturdy form; If rude and crude they throb with motion, They leap with liberty of ocean And the storm; For worlds of fair and foreign art, Give me instead one island heart. I sing the gallant faith that higher Raises us than arms, And brings Eternity yet nigher Mid a thousand harms; That wrought this iron bone and grit By salt of seas and tempest knit And dreadful odds, By clash of constant war with Nature Which lifts the feeblest to the stature Of the gods; I ask no better help in need, Than in our grand old columned creed. DREAM OF PERFECTION. I seek a vain perfection, and I seek the Golden Land, Where robed in resurrection light the forms of beauty stand, And night and day in white array At one in glory stand; Where shine the archetypes of each fair thing we body out, So dimly in our distant speech and darkly splendid doubt. I seek the sources hidden and beyond this mortal sight, Where grow the fruits forbidden in their loneliness of Light; By sea and shore for evermore, I seek that mystic Light. And O to be a Master in that throned and reverend throng, Who rose to vision vaster up the silver steps of Song; Who call us now with solemn brow, From summits of clear Song; And O to join a brother's hand and take an equal part, With those that fashioned this free land and gave the imperial heart; To walk upon the mountains of sublime and regal thought, And drink of the deep fountains whence the mighty worlds are wrought, And with my peers and holy seers, Share in the wonders wrought! I want to win completeness in some little part of mine, And raised upon unmeetness to attain the tops divine, Where crowned and calm with glorious palm The Makers sit divine. I want to reach by simple stress the heights, whence only start The purity of perfectness and ecstasy of art; And thus I dare to wrestle with the mysteries of strife, That I at last may nestle in the beating breast of Life, And throb in tune through frost or June With Nature's secret Life. Ah, if the end proved fateful and destruction were the price, By portals dread and hateful, I would choose the sacrifice; If poet powers shed deathless flowers, To deck the sacrifice. I would not count the fearful cost which opened heaven in gloom, If unto knowledge I had crost through hell-like doors of doom. And though the inspiration were as dreadful as God's kiss, The final revelation would but come to me as bliss; When all on fire with gained desire, I died in burning bliss. THIS WAY LIES MADNESS Wild night not half so wild in terror As is the dreadful thought Which drives me with its hounding error, Into Eternal Nought; O robe me round within thy bound Of awful joy and fear profound, That I may rest upon thy breast This heart with the wide world opprest; And thus at last may wholly cease Awhile from sounds of sadness, And buried in thee find release From this pursuing madness. I know—yet whence have I the knowledge Unguessed by holy Paul, Untought in cloister and in College?— That nothing is at all. I know this sight is mocking light And there was never day or night, And what I see yet cannot be For mortal and is not for me; And what I fancy that I hear Is but a mocking message, The music murmuring in my ear Has neither past nor presage. I know, by ghastly inspiration, There is no solid earth, The raptures of our revelations Delusions are of dearth; I know tall towers are false as flowers That only cheat the charmèd hours, There is no sky, no land to fly, No echo of Eternity; No matter ever was, or mind To wear an outward clothing, And every soul is dead and blind In this Eternal nothing. I know the human and Divinity Are but a passing thought, And all the wonders of Infinity, Begin and end in Nought; And what I know of sham and show Within me and above, below, The tightening chain, the lengthening pain, Alike and equally are vain; The patience like a garment wrapt, Dear bliss and dearer sorrow, The splendid sins and hopes unmapt, Are phantoms with no morrow. I know my dearest ones are bubbles And but a tender trick, To vanish with my gains or troubles At the first ruder prick; I know the kiss and serpent's hiss And horrors churned by the abyss, The harlot's gawd, the blame or laud, Are everyone a hideous fraud; And God and Devil if they live For our dim love or loathing, Are less than shades most fugitive And just Eternal Nothing. I know the sharpest pang or feeling With which my body thrills, Is only what appears unreeling Of unexistent ills; For stillness, strife, and death and life, The sacrificial cord and knife, The star that gleams on mountain streams, Are not so much as madmen's dreams; I know by teaching rude and rough And every day's acrostic, I do not even know enough To know I'm an Agnostic. Wild night, not half so wild with scourges Of hunting wind and rain, As is the thought like frantic surges So branded on my brain; O unto thee no longer free From dark to dark I vainly flee, Who know that all is but the pall Of nothing that can rise or fall; Entomb me and my cruel thought Behind thy friendly curtain, With thee in that Eternal Nought Which is the one thing certain. MAN THAT IS BORN OF WOMAN. Man that is born of woman, mingled of love and light, Sorrow and all things human, goeth from night to night; Out of the darkness taken, out of the silence brought, Just for a moment shaken dimly by dream and thought; Laid in the lap of beauty holy and strong and mild, Cradled in arms of Duty, nursed like a baby child; Dazzled by many a vision haunting his troubled sleep, Hopes that in dear derision back in the formless deep Ebb with their unsaid knowledge; cheated by cries that thrill Cloister and reverend college—man is in darkness still; Man that is born of woman, rising up early and late Resting, is doomed, and no man born may resist his fate. Man, by the Unseen Potter moulded of mist and clay Yet though the fire grow hotter, maketh the night his day; Out of the gulf of shadows shining a little space, Set like a flower in meadows flushed with a dying grace; Coming from awful stillness forth from Creation's womb, Merely with pain and illness buildeth himself a tomb; Learning in vain for ever how he may truly talk, Where with his lame endeavour feet can in blindness walk Surely, nor stray or stumble; finding his meat of tears, Slow and by stages humble telleth his tale of years; Man by the Unseen Potter fashioned of fears though brave, Vanquished and still a plotter diggeth him but a grave. Man, that is shaped of madness, doubting, decay and mirth, Sinketh at last with sadness leavened of earth in earth; Over his head the mountains climb and he climbeth too, Under his step the fountains flow as his weepings do; Stars on his pathway twinkle faintly and up he turns, Passions beneath him sprlnkle blood from their crimson urns; Phantoms before him glimmer waving the wrecker's torch, Only to leave him dimmer lost in the outside porch, Loves with their bondage pleasant hold him deceived awhile, Lured by the mocking present into a ghastly smile; Man that is shaped of madness, laying aside his husk Painted with grief and gladness, passeth from dusk to dusk. Man yet is more than mortal, meant for no dwelling here, Tending toward some portal up in some purple sphere; Where in the shade of glory curtained from feeble sight, After a sunset gory trembleth a dawn's delight; Out of the smoke and ashes leapeth the heart of flame Bright with aurora flashes, kissing the brow of shame; Past all the channels bitter scoring mistaken deed, Nature is ploughed and fitter soil for the golden seed; Not like the purblind seeing now on the narrow clod, Bliss of a greater being broadening up to God; Man yet is more than mortal, somehow his soul will rend Bars of his bounds consortal, sometime the night must end. SPINNING. As I was spinning, a Blessed one said, “Wherefore this trouble and toil?” Life is an eddy of dust, to be laid Soon with its clamour and coil.” Then I made answer, “I know not, I feel Only I ever must spin Web that is mingled of iron and steel, Woven in sorrow and sin; Crimson with blood of my heart is the thread Tangled by thorns of the strife, Calling the dreams of the beautiful dead Back to a lovelier life.” As I was spinning, a Child to me spake, “Wherefore this labour and grief? Life is but joy, and the roses awake Bringing the balm of relief.” So I responded, “I care not, I know Merely I alway must spin Web that is wedded to fire and the snow, Fashioned in darkness and sin; Here may be wedding robe, here may be shroud, Growing on early and late, Blessing or curse may come forth from the cloud— Yet it is nothing but fate.” As I was spinning a Wanderer cried, “Wherefore this passion and pain? Life without change is unseen and untried, Study and visions are vain.” But I replied, “If I know not my doom, Still I for ever must spin Web that is painted of glory and gloom, Pictured in sweetness and sin; May be a body and may be a soul Destiny bids me work out, Bells ring for feastings or funerals toll, I can delay not or doubt.” As I was spinning a Siren said this, “Wherefore the leaves and no fruit? Life is red rapture and bosom and kiss, Amorous breath and pursuit.” “Ah,” I did answer, “I know not the truth, Save that I always must spin Web that is knotted with ashes and youth, Dabbled in dying and sin; Mine may be heaven and mine may be hell, Gladness or woe never gone, Conqueror's crown or a prisoner's cell, I sew in ignorance on.” APHRODITE. Ambrosial night hung over sea and land, The kissing moonbeams played about the sand In warm white beauty, and each murmuring shell Laughed as the silver fire upon it fell. A little wind rose from the west, and flew On wings of music that a season blew In fragrant wafts, half-weary and half-shy, As some spent babe sings its own lullaby. And, lo, a shadow, that was light and lay As soft as sleep when silence has its way, Dropt with its cloak and left its magic mark; And all the earth was all divinely dark; The northern lights flashed in the northern sky, And the great wheels of Time went dreamily. But then, incarnate ecstasy, she came In mist and movement and the flower of flame That blushed and blossomed into crimson joy, As if the world were but its tender toy; Not out of fruitful soil or lilied lea, But from the embraces of the earth and sea Just where they met and married, glad she came Naked and lovely without thought of shame; Queen Aphrodite, wonderful and sweet, As ripples leaped and washed her pure white feet. She stood a moment dallying ere she stept Forth on the land, that in the shadow crept Or seemed to creep as conquered to her side And laid beneath her all its power and pride. Beautiful there she bowed to meet the bliss, With mouth that gave and yet denied the kiss Of sacrament, and leant upon the wind Which touched one heavy tress that trailed behind And caught its perfumed passion, while she stood In the young wealth of conscious womanhood, With pearls of foam and spray of emeralds fair And snakes of gold that were her gleaming hair, Laden with love that from her seemed to flow; Her scornful lips were like a scarlet bow And shot forth burning arrows, dew and breath Of bloom and life that was delicious death. The bushes knelt, the tall trees bowed the head, The moonbeams made a carpet for her tread, The green leaves rustled and stretched out their arms And wove a dress for her uncovered charms, The flints before her turned to precious gems And stepping stones, the iron armèd stems Forgot their thorns and nature, and the soil Opened its treasures without stint or toil An offering, and the world unbought by price Became one altar of free sacrifice. Her large glad eyes with sorrow seemed to fill, Earth trembled at her footstep and stood still. She felt the calling of the yearning years, The joy that fed the fountain of our tears, And forward bent to catch the distant strain Mixed with the measures of all bliss and pain, While rapture wrestled with the glorious grief And clasped and yet refused its rich relief. But then a passion, like some mighty gale's Wet with the memories of a thousand tales Of surging seas, that took and shook her form, Poured in her eyes the trouble of the storm And clothed the heavy lids with gracious gloom That heightened the round cheeks' rejoicing bloom, And hung the long dark lashes with soft sights Of diamond drops and opals' mystic lights, And curled the ripe red lips with messages Till they brimed over as bright chalices, And left a haunting shadow deep and dim On the bold curve of each voluptuous limb, And threw around the palpitating frame The poetry that has no mortal name. She marked the picture of all space and time, All worlds revolving to the same rapt chime Of everlasting love; the pomp of Rome; And Israel's faith, that walked the heaven as home; The wit of Hellas, that revealed the heart Of life and shaped it forth in shining art Exceeding fair, and made the deeps disclose The power of passion wedded to repose; And the cold culture of the earth-bound West Forged in the fire and on the iron breast Of anvils hammered into soulless might And brute perfection of a dead delight, With fragrance yet in vision and at feast And golden gleams of the enchanted East— All set to one great conquering melody, That moved the engines of eternity. And everywhere she saw, that sovereign clue To kingly action made it strong and true, Love's one white moment, when the unveiled face Looked first in awe on Nature's naked grace And lived, and read the riddle of the years, Knowledge of good and evil, orbed with fears; And consciousness turned inward thrilled to find Itself so comely and the God behind, And laughed and trembled as a fluttered dove To feel the final word of life was love. This rolled life's river beneath bluer skies On its broad path of fair humanities And ministrations of heroic hands That shook the world and moulded larger lands, And gave sweet codes and uses to redress Moralities of gaunt unloveliness, And charters of high thought that drank of wells Where beauty bathed and so renewed its spells. Love was the breath of liberties and right, And edged the sword that in the front of fight Waved ever onward as it flashed and fell; And laid warm limbs on beds of asphodel, Where lips met lips and bosom bosom fired And sobbed the secret that the soul desired. Ah, beyond bloody creeds and cults she saw A new religion and another law Of gentleness that ruled the ruler's pride And bade him walk a subject at her side, With charities that rose on eagle wings To heaven and thence returned as crowns for kings; And earth the passing fashion of a glove, To the great sceptred sweetnesses of love. But then the trouble from her scarlet lips And haunted eyes in passionate eclipse, Dropt like a robe in the outbreaking shine That showed her human daintiness divine, And the one glory and the simple dress Of her own pure and naked loveliness. A rosy cloud, that hid no glowing part And quivered with the beating of her heart, Like innocence was coyly round her curled; Heaven smiled above, and at her feet the world. Thus forth she went to conquer every god, And on all time to triumph as she trod; While those white feet, that nothing could asperse, Seemed as the pulsings of the universe. And stept in tune with Nature, on her way Through the dim night that crimsoned into day. PALIMPSEST. Talk not of dark December And all its cruel snow, For then I still remember And hear the life below. I see no rod of iron Empearled with icy gems, But only Spring the Siren Betwixt the barren stems. In frost I mark but pages Of summer flowering free, And in the wind that rages The murmuring of the bee. The shine is in the shadow, The harvest in the cold, And on the miry meadow Are buttercups of gold. Talk not of dark December Because my head is grey, My heart's undying ember Keeps youthful holiday. ARCHITEKTON. I build no temples out of common stone; My starry throne Disdains the marble, as the sordid mud And tinsel bud; But in my work are wedded blood and fire With grim desire, And thoughts that blossom in heroic reach Of spacious speech; No gems, though born a thousand thousand years, But iron tears And prayer and passion of enduring trust In death and dust; No harlotries of paint or nude undress, But war's caress Of flame and sword that meet with careless might The armèd Night, And leaping life that is the light of men With human ken, The natural touch as true as sunrise call Redeeming all. MY OLD SCHOOL. To thee my memory turns, old School, From pleasures new and vain, And I would hail the Dunce's stool To have those joys again; Ah, I could kiss the penal rod To visit thee once more, And tread the fields I gaily trod Or glean thy classic lore; And I would gladly drop the crown That merely mocks my lack, And face the Master's righteous frown To call my springtide back. To thee my fancy flies, dear School, From sober works of age, The empty toil, the broken tool, The blurred and blotted page; I mourn the uncongenial task, The phrase so often sung, The painting of the perjured mask Which cannot make me young; I miss the comrades of my morn, The bandied blow or jest, And now I only feel the thorn Though roses grace my breast. To thee my spirit spreads, old School, The tendrils of its trust, And finds in thee a shadow cool From weary din and dust; I see the fond familiar strife, Which pre-enacted then The future battle-field of life, With fiery speech or pen; I hear the muster-roll of names With mine so fitly blent, The hurly-burly of the games, The mimic parliament. To thee affection's tide, dear School. At evening with new zest Returns from rocky bed and pool And windings, as to rest: I find the world has graver ill And lessons longer yet, And for the young pretexta still What would I not forget? I'd blithely put my toga off And every bigger toy, With this gray heart I cannot doff, To be again a boy. MY LADY SLEEPS. When down my Lady laid her head Gold on the dusky night, The silence like a curtain spread A sweetness more than sight. A little moon was in the sky, A little moon went up, And O but it went pleasantly With its dear yellow cup. It seemed so small and very near The dim and hollow land, As if its treasures cool and clear Could lie within my hand. And like a silvèr tear one star, Caught in the outer glow As if it might not travel far, Hung beautiful below. And through the purple night a cloud By gentle winds was drawn, That did not dare to speak aloud The tidings of the dawn. And still the blossoms watched and wept Beside my Lady's place, And shed their petals (where she slept) White-rose on rose-white face. Break not the spell, For she sleeps well, With lily arms And shadowed charms, And graces all too pure for harms Delicious and ineffable. CHURCH BELLS. Through the curtained mist and snow Come those voices, Come those voices From the land of Long-ago, Like an angel who rejoices In the loves of Long-ago: Chiming, chiming, Rhyming, rhyming, In a rapture more than art, With the music of the heart. Little Mother, Is it thou From the beauty on thy brow, From the bliss which cannot smother Human feeling where it lies Lapt in the eternities, Calling, calling Words of balm and comfort falling On my breast That will not rest? Little Mary On thy throne, With the story Of thy glory As a zone, Where no winds of trouble vary The unutterable joy And the peace that cannot cloy, Little Mother, Is it thou Drawn more nearly dearly now? Or another, Whom I lost, When by waves of trouble tost I was left along and low In the land of Long-ago? Little Una, soft and white, Is it thou, From the splendour infinite Fain to bow With thy blessings And caressings Framed in tender sounds and tunes Sweet as roses of all Junes, On this gray and care-worn head And my heart already dead? Do I hear my children crying, Crying, crying, For me yet, In that ghostly music dying, Dying, dying, For the one they can't forget? Up and down and high and low, Soft and slow, Melodies of Eden blow One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, Out of heaven Unto earth From the darkness and the dearth. Little brother Is it thou, Christ, in answer to my vow, Not another, With the thorns all turned to stars And bright jewels where were scars? Art Thou speaking To my soul, As those echoes run and roll, Through the frost and shadows wreaking All their icy wrath and pain On my eyes that upward strain, But in vain— But in vain? Hear the voices swelling, swelling Through the night and telling, telling What on earth we never know, As they faintly ebb and flow; Hopes and fears and joys and sorrows Sweeter than the sweetest morrows, Truths that in the bosom flutter Which no mortal yet may utter To his fellow, Till the yellow Sheaves of garnered toils and times Murmur with those evening chimes Prophecies of peace and wonder In new life, And the strains above and under All our strife; Hear the voices ringing, ringing Messages of larger hope, Like the angels singing, singing As the gates of Eden ope. But the secret that they tell Though in part, As they gently swoon and swell, To my heart; Is that it were only vain To pursue by quest or pain Beauty that has no one dress, And through changes Flits and ranges, Now as love, now happiness; That is never seen till past, And when on the clouds before Shadows of the truth are cast, While we wonder and adore. When we seem to lay our hold On its treasure, Better far than gain of gold And all pleasure; Lo, it melts within the grasp Of the noblest deed or duty, Like the melting of the snow: It eludes the iron clasp And is gone—and where is Beauty? In the land of Long-ago. THE OLD YEAR. I take the book and turn the pages So mean and squalid to the last, And shut it in the shadowed Past Among the dead and buried ages. I lay it with the relics older Of each departed time and toy, Like roseleaves crushed, to mix and moulder. And there with many a glorious vision Too often all the world to me, Will it abide a bliss to see Or fade in darkness and derision? It looks a volume sad and awful, Now as it passes from my hand Into the sere and silent land, A thing unlovely and unlawful. A blank has gulfed the mighty sentence, And jeweled word and chiseled line That as the morning seemed to shine Are dashed with tears of salt repentance. But there my life is full depicted And gathered to the misty shelf, The dust and stains are all myself And they by me alone convicted. THE NEW YEAR. Before me looms the threshold, lying Between two shadows yet a shade Itself by unseen fingers made, Between the future days and flying. The old dear loves behind grow dimmer With downcast eyes and veilèd face And outstretched hands beyond embrace, And dear new loves that greet me glimmer. I waver between tears and laughter, And all my heart distracted cries Drawn by the two eternities, The precious Past and hope's Hereafter. The ties were beautiful now broken, The red lips vanished more than sweet And fond the white and rhythmic feet With passion that was never spoken. But then the Future tells a story Of larger worlds and ways to be, Unknown and virginal and free Like some fair woman in her glory. The two hands drop with crimson roses, Soft music is the fragrant breath, And be it life or be it death I choose the grace that half uncloses. RECONCILED. But yet the same are brow and bosom, The same the glances coyly cast, For in the Future lies the Past And in the Past the Future's blossom. But though I may not turn or tarry And must go sadly gladly on, It is the former sun that shone And the old peace with me I carry. I cross the bound, I pass the portal, With the old heart and feelings bright And Him whose Shadow is our Light, Until he calls me home immortal. MORS MORTUA. Death came to me and said “Arise” And leave this world of sorrow With baby things thou shouldst despise, And meet a fairer morrow; I love thee, gentle woman child, Though thou art young and little, But life is sad and brittle And winter winds are often wild; For thou art dearer to me far Than to thy earthly kin, Here is the door, uplift the bar And boldly enter in.” I answered Death who came to me An angel in his splendour, “I cannot walk alone with thee, For I am small and tender: If I could only with me take My precious toys and brothers, I'd give the earth to others And care not what I did forsake; But with no parents, I may ill Enjoy the weary way; And if no sisters go, who will Remain with me to play?” Death came to me again, and cried, “Arouse thyself, make ready, The day is short and rest denied, Thy aims are all unsteady; Renounce those idle works and flee The world and vapid pleasures, Its trifles and its treasures, And turn to nobler tasks with me: I love thee for thy radiant youth, As comrades have not done; Awake, and I will shew thee truth And beauty both are one.” I answered death, who did appear Garbed as in hasty travel, “The hours are bright companions dear, With riddles to unravel; I cannot journey with thee yet, The leaves are green and sappy, And I am far too happy, To move before the sun has set; Unless I gather of the fruits That ripen at my hand, And carry with me my pursuits And passions to thy land.” Death came to me once more, arrayed In miry pilgrim vesture, And said, “Thou hast too much delayed,” With quick imperious gesture; “Gird up thy robe, prepare thy mind, For noontide now is mellow And I require a fellow. Woe is before and shame behind: I love thee and in kindness call, Though thou art wedded wife, Beneath the shadow of the pall I would redeem thy life.” I answered death, who summoned so My service with fit reason, “I am too busy now to go And wait a proper season; I cannot break the thousand ties That link me to the mortal, And at thy gloomy portal The world with every wisdom flies; And I must drink more wisdom yet The cup of human bliss, And then I gladly will forget Gold hair and crimson kiss.” Death came to me again, and said, “The day is nearly over, I need thee sorely and thy aid, Thou hast been long a rover; Ah, light thy lamp with blessèd oil, And hasten ere the curtain Of night with rays uncertain Descend upon thy dreary toil: I love thee, O my sister, best In spite of foolish fears, And lead thee to the living rest Beyond the barren years.” I answered Death, whose face was cold And withered sore with sadness, “I am a useless thing and old And yearn for ease and gladness; I cannot wend that bitter road Without some kindly neighbour, I have no strength for labour And faint beneath the lightest load; And I must warm my chilly frame Before the friendly fire, And grow familiar with thy name Till one is our desire.” Death came no more with muffled feet To see my lamp was kindled, Though earth no longer now seemed sweet And flowers to dust had dwindled; Yea, though I hungered for the tread Which erst I deemed no saving But now was my one craving, Yet death at last himself was dead; And thus I carry in my breast The world's unbroken tie, In grim repose which is unrest, And now I cannot die. Death cometh not, who hath to some Pale suppliants for pity With speed, and never can he come To me in fields or city; He takes the comrades from my side, The grandchild from my bosom In brighter realms to blossom, And every joy that would abide; But me he leaves to suffer on With heavy brow and breath, With all the life of living gone And still without the Death. UNDER SCARLET. Under the beautiful scarlet of skies Thunder-appareled and thwart, she arose Fair as a blossom and sweet with her brown Hair that in fluctuant ecstasy heaved; Over the heather that blushed at her feet, Rover-like, fetterless, exquisite, white, Clad in her viriginal purity, tall, Glad as a child just escaped from a school. Lightly she met me with laughter and song Brightly attuned to the beat of her heart Set to my music of love, as I played Yet on the strings with a masterful touch. Long were our kisses, and never thought we Wrong of the union that made us both one. Little we recked of the future or dreamed Brittle the bond of our passion, that then Throbbed out the story so soon to be all Robbed of its liberty, blanched in its bloom. Gaily we parted, expecting again Daily renewal of raptures foredoomed. NO MORE. The way is closing in, like barriers rise Hedges of armèd thorn, Betwixt me and each rapturous old surprise And gates of golden morn. No more for me the boundlessness of blue, The splendid courts of Space, The clouds of glory that were but the clue To show my Father's face; No more the tossing and tempestuous hills, The thunder-cradled crest Lost in the light, as souls from stormy ills Sink on the Saviour's breast. No more the statued galleries of Time In pillared palaces, Stay unreluctant steps with dreams sublime And marble messages. No more I wake each day to something new As eager as a boy, While from fresh worlds I lightly brush the dew As from a flower or toy. The curtained path grows smaller with my cares, The burden and the rod, And shutting out the earth and all its snares It shuts me in to God. New thoughts arouse no more the glow and thrill That bade my heart rebound, Till it ran over and was fain to spill Its joy on all around. The pride and passion of the world seem fled, Its altars do not burn, And dear old faces that were cold and dead Like dawn to me return. The children and the fancies of my youth, Whatever made me free, Come back with every simple sacred truth Learned at my mother's knee. The grandest things put off their royal dress And step most humbly down, While many a mean unhonoured littleness Assumes a kingly crown. The shadows wrap me close, the sunbeams droop With morning once so sweet, And blush (where stars were beacons) as I stoop The daisies at my feet. The earth goes farther off, the Heaven draws near Which faith has ever trod, And with an awful bliss akin to fear Alone I walk with God. THE SPIRIT OF SPACE. In the bright gardens of the air, Where roses blue and lilies red Meet in a wedlock free and fair, And weave a carpet for God's tread, I hear a voice, I hear a song Which in a carol low and long Proclaims to all the world “Rejoice!” I see no form, I see no face, But music rises rich and warm; It is the Spirit Bird of Space. At first some trickling drops of sound, That in a splendid mist are spent Before they reach the thirsty ground So pining for their nourishment; I hear a cry, I hear a call And with a music sweet to all, As out of old eternity. I see no wing, I see no trace Of angels who in glory sing; It is the Spirit Bird of Space. Then fuller and more free like rain A melody but not of earth, Above our pleasure and our pain, Descends a silver dew on dearth; I hear a shout, I hear a rush Of rippling notes that glance and gush, As if all heaven were breaking out; I see no form, I see no face, The lyrist walks upon the storm; It is the Spirit Bird of Space. The floodgates part, and drooping flowers Unclose their crimson lips and slake Their bosoms with refreshing showers Of music, as they laugh and wake; I hear a spell, I hear a hope, As if God's upper windows ope And let the fountains leap and swell; I see no mark, I see no grace Of shape in depths with sunshine dark; It is the Spirit Bird of Space. GENESIS. Its cradle was the cloud of fire That rolled for endless ages back, And wrapt in terrible attire It trod the solitary track And silent zone Around God's throne, The seed of life and all desire, Through awful space and worlds in wrack; While systems rose And systems fell, And passed through blackness of repose To blazing force ineffable. The shadow went, the beauty came With ordered day and ordered night; From cunning frost and carving flame The flower of earth burst into light, And rolling on Rejoiced and shone In homage to the Holy Name, The Love that fashioned all aright; And bliss to be A living tide, In systolè, disastolè, Pulsed through its heart in rhythmic pride. THE LAST WOMAN. A clouded heaven, a cursèd globe Wrapt in its fated funeral robe, A solemn silent gloom That with its horror rolled on each Pale thing, as on some blasted beach The waters roll to doom; I saw the burden of a vision Of the gray coming years, And gates that opened in derision To show the shrouded fears; And lone, in dead creation, stood A woman in her womanhood. Hope had departed, she was left Of all but love and life bereft, And still she struggled on; And still her face by sickness marred, With vanquished pain and sorrow scarred, Bright as an angel shone. Her sole companion was the thunder Low in a lurid sky, She trod the earth she trampled under Clothed in eternity. Betwixt the sunset and the storm, Palm-like arose her pillared form. No foot was on the palsied land Which trembled with its dreary brand, No sail upon the sea, No music dropt from laughing lip, No clasp of kindly fellowship, No maiden's murmured plea. The dust had opened wide its portal, And welcomed in its womb The young and sweet and what was mortal, Till Time was but a tomb. And none but she drew living breath, Within that voiceless world of death. A sudden plague had swooped like night On wings of famine and affright, Down on the troubled earth; It poisoned all the haunted air, And when it found an Eden fair It left an aching dearth. Men cast of iron pined and perished Before that dreadful wave, And tenderest things were only cherished To moulder in the grave; A shadow rested on the day, And where the stricken fell they lay. She saw them going one by one, Her weary work might not be done Till she had buried all; Her dearest in their youth and pride Lay down in sadness at her side, She heard their faintest call; The sick with softest hand she tended And soothed the breaking tie, Till each poor tortured life was ended And yet she could not die. A cemetery was her throne, In awful peace she reigned alone. But for her babe she suffered sore That he might live a little more, And from the general fate Be plucked to babble at her breast And woo and win delicious rest— She suffered long and late. And though the tide of woe came faster, Her love refused to yield And stronger than all dire disaster Enclosed him like a shield. But soon that sparkling life was spent, And into the great darkness went. And now in solitary calm, Uplifted as some stately palm That guards a burial ground, She stood in the dim dreadful light With her scarred beauty grand and bright And with her sorrow crowned; Above all need, above all anguish, She faced her desperate lot, The heaven and earth might lie and languish, Unconquered she would not; Beneath her grovelled wrecks of time, But yet her heart kept constant chime. She saw her treasured darling still Beyond the passion and the ill, Beyond the veil of tears, And all her spirit rushed to meet The patter of those pretty feet, Adown the coming years. No word of hope or fear she uttered Who spurned the common band, The baffled thunder moaned and muttered, The lightning licked her hand. And there she stood with regal head, A faithful watcher by her dead. She heard the music of his call That rang for ever over all And echoed through her heart, That flooded sombre land and sky With its own immortality, Wherein all had a part. And, lo, the clouds of gray affliction Before her seemed to bow, And rested like a benediction Bright on her holy brow The solemn sun that sank to rest, With her was glorified and blest. Aloud the storm its trumpets blew, And dank mists to destruction flew On seas and continents, She marked no ruin of the globe And simply saw the baby robe In earth's dull cerements; The vapours were his golden tresses The breezes did disperse, And his dear little lovelinesses Attired the universe. She stood a pillar of white fire, Sceptred with her one calm desire. JACOB'S LADDER. Lo, weary once of toiling And weary once of rest, And finding roseleaves soiling In love's sublimer quest, As each day I grew sadder And hopeless of my kind I passed up Jacob's Ladder And left the world behind. But how, O do not question; The angels sealed my lips (For fear of this suggestion) With soft and sweet eclipse. The prophet and the poet, The maiden and the child As yet unfallen know it, And all the undefiled. I entered the white portal Where one are flower and seed, And where in life immortal Unite the will and deed. The birds with satin pinions Drenched in the dazzling sun, Have soared to those dominions And in their circuits run. And babies, with their moulding Fresh from the Maker's hand, Like heavenly blooms unfolding Come from the Golden Land. SOMEWHERE. The light is shining somewhere, If I in darkness move, Though it has never come where I wait my life and love. Somewhere in purple mountains Leap forth the laughing waves, When I can see no fountains But tears that water graves. And somewhere eyes flash greeting That promise joys to be, And ripe red lips are meeting But have no kiss for me. The dew is somewhere falling On golden cups of flowers, While I keep vainly calling For never-dropping showers. The night somewhere brings cover And kindness of pure rest, But I am not a lover To sleep upon her breast. Somewhere the yoke is pleasure And battle is but play, While I have toil for treasure And only clouds that stay. But yet I know that somewhere The dawn will hallow strife, And blessing smile and come where I wait my love and life. PRE-EXISTENCE. I cannot say what others think, I know I had a life In former lands on battle's brink and fought a faded strife; For visions of old gallant fields and shivered helms and battered shields Come to me often back, With tossing crests and mailèd breasts and all the struggle's stern behests, And gild my quiet track— With glories that are dead and gone and yet do somehow linger on, In splendid wrath and wrack. I see the squadrons as they clash, the iron froth and fear, When it is better to be rash and face thè destined spear; I hear the riving and the driving of red blades that hiss, The thunder and the bliss. I cannot dream what others tell, I am sure an age ago Within a dreary cloistered cell I lived and prayed below And sought for what I hardly knew, while round my peace the tempest blew But could not enter in; The world's mad waves were ghastly graves for herds of overdriven slaves With sorrow and the sin, But I in vigils lone and late recked not of brothers' bitter fate— Who suffered or might win. And now at wakeful morning times my bosom yet seems girt With music of departed chimes and the rude horsehair shirt, And then the tolling and the knolling of the past matin bell Revives the buried spell. I cannot guess what others feel, but certain am I yet Once with a weapon more than steel in summers that have set I lived, and listening peoples hung upon the passion of my tongue Which gave unwritten law; And sharp as swords my burning words made and unmade the kings and lords, As creatures out of straw; While downtrod masses hailed a home, a hospitable sacred dome, Within my shadow's awe. And still when I behold a wrong or fret at cruel ire, My spirit rushes into song and soars on wings of fire, And with the yearning comes returning in its dreadful dower Of all my ancient power. I cannot judge what others may, I know in centuries past My life was a mean drudge's day and learned to toil and fast; And never finished was the round of hateful work which grimly ground My body in the dust, And ceaseless woes were hourly foes and racked me as with earthquake throes At their own wicked lust; When time was an increasing task and mocked at rest I fain would ask, With creeds and codes unjust. But still when labour more than meet again on me is laid I hear the tramp of plodding feet which seek but find not aid, And on my bending back unending burdens fall and still I tread the iron mill. THE MISSING ATOM. When God made man and dowered with awful reason He did not finish quite His poor clay vessel, But planted him on land and turned the seas on And gave him hills and woods with which to wrestle; That he might quarry out a soul by toiling, And be again himself his own creator Through sin and sorrow of the day and morrow, By armèd will which took the world for spoiling, And be its legislator. He wrought him comely and keen-witted, With eyes that coasted heaven and earth and boasted Tremendous things of thought and vision; But He omited Among the glorious gifts that which was greatest, Not in delight of cold derision, But out of love and wisdom the sedatest. He clothed his lips with thunder, as on Chatham He poured the passion of the speaker, And breathed a gnôsis Quick as the lark's apotheosis Which walks the paths of air, but left him weaker By this one vital flaw—a missing atom. But what it is, no sage, no lover, No seer who reads the future's riddle And plucks its secret from the Night's blank middle, Can yet discover. It's that which in the sweetest sounds' election Establishes the void of something lacking, The cracking Of strainèd strings, the jar and trouble Which turn the best to lovely imperfection; An absent note, that else would double The treasures setting in the getting, And proved but flashes Shed idly upon funeral ashes. And thought of subtlest mind however far gone Down in the deeps unplumbed, unsounded, Has never compassed this ethereal argon And from the search comes back confounded, Baffled by this one ray so dim, so distant; Which is a blurring In brightest portraits and a blot resistant; And seems a slurring Of pictured beauty which denies its duty, Without the sweetness Which only gives the crown of full completeness. When God made man He gave His own Divinity In measure, Short of that dread infinity Encompassing all space and time at pleasure To see before and after, Through blessèd tears and bitter laughter And surf of sinning Which at His calm white feet is broken And spoiled of fruits ere done or spoken, The end in the beginning. That man thus wrought should wax yet wiser From conscious might and native neediness, And be a brave despiser Of little pains and brittle gains And fleeting gawds and earth-bound greediness; Attaining slowly and by stages lowly To something grand and beautiful and holy, Purged of his drosses by the losses And lifted up on burning crosses To the great stature Of gracious Godhead and consummate nature. And so among the crime and kissing Of clashing souls that firmly, faintly, Climb up or down His altar steps and stumble To unconjectured issues sad or saintly, We have one atom missing— Which bids the firmest of foundations crumble. We mourn it in the music never rounded Quite by the last fair finish Of perfect art, ungrounded All on the eternal bases, lacking somewhat To carry sick hearts home when days diminish Their glory, and to rest us (come what Might in the morning of the morrow) With the clear dayshine of diviner sorrow. This absent ray, which could enkindle ages With unheard splendour And turn our midnight bosoms tender As the soft light on golden Gospel pages, We ask for ever; And still we must in poor purblind endeavour, Who seek we know not what and dimly, dumbly, Do voyage for a yet uncharted haven Where marriage bells are always ringing; Led by that dream-note which (though we be craven) Would, if we listened humbly, Put all the world in tune and keep it singing. GRAY FEELINGS. If snow were all outside, it were but little— Nay, it were truly well, Part of the frosty spell, Which drops at last on each and leaves life brittle. I do not murmur that my head is hoary, And icy traces linger; Because it is God's finger, Which writes upon me now memento mori. I know that pleasures fade Within the growing shade, Which no one can evade, And with the oldness comes a coldness. My house is feeble and the rooftree trembles Beneath the venomed blast, And the undying Past Wakes terrors in my heart which ill dissembles; And pain athwart my eaves with jagged splinter Hangs as the water frozen, With pangs I cannot cozen To silence—but this is not all the winter. For in my secret breast However brightly drest The chills and vapours rest, And the last ember is December. I do not mark so much the tempest reelings At which I often start, But snow about my heart And in its sacred hush the dim gray feelings; The frost has seized my hopes and rudely scattered, And grimly with its mesh old Weaves on my very threshold The fatal web which never yet was shattered; It sets the bitter clasp Of fretting points, that rasp, My strength, against the grasp, And through the marrow drives its harrow. Till from dull windows with their muffled curtain Of mist and murky fog, And heavy airs that clog My straining sight, the earth looms all uncertain. Dear loves, that early blazed like friendly beacons In dim despair are shrouded, And God's own Face is clouded In twilight and His hold upon me weakens; And deeply in my life With doubting sick and rife Rolls the wan winter strife, As on sere meadows evening shadows. IN MOHAMMED'S COFFIN. I had a frightful dream, Yet sadly true; I wandered through a world without a beam, Without a clue, And plagued by visions of malign derisions Could nowhere find one saving rift of blue. It was not darkness But it seemed not light, And yet I saw with dreadful sight All horrors in their native starkness, The seeds and sources of the hidden forces Which glimmered as a dead man's face from night; And I was swung, and carried off in Mohammed's coffin. Betwixt the heaven and earth, I grimly hung; My soul was parched with an exceeding dearth, My fingers clung To air and nothing, as if matter's clothing Had gone and left me scarcely even a tongue. For empty spaces Round me rolling spread An awful blank I dimly read, Who idly sought for friendly faces; And desolation, sheer abomination, Beneath me yawned and deepened overhead; And sealed with silence, could I scoff in Mohammed's coffin? I laboured hard to speak, But all in vain; For the Great Void had made my spirit weak With ghostly pain, And its drear lightness bound me with a tightness More searching than a ponderous prison chain. I was not living, Nor in any grave; But still a creature worse than slave, I only felt one vast misgiving; And in the terror of the hopeless error, Knew nowise what to question or to crave Of doubtings, which I could not doff in Mohammed's coffin. And then the shadow past A breathing time, And on the gaping gulf was sweetly cast A moment's chime From sunny borders, where celestial orders Walked in glad garments at their work sublime. But when the story Of their perfect bliss, Where all was good and nought amiss, Touched me though hardly with its glory; Then without pity from the radiant City, They thrust me from them back to my Abyss; And I was swung, and carried off in Mohammed's coffin. Again beneath the haze Earth wavered up, And sunrise smote me as my hungry gaze Would eager sup Once more on blessings old and soft caressings, Which opened to me like a golden cup. But ere a second Of that grateful feast, So precious to me in the least, Which with familiar features beckon'd; The pleasant table melted like a fable, And grudged the very crumbs it gave the beast; While I was poised, a vulgar scoff, in Mohammed's coffin. The curse upon my life Is heavy still, And pampered doubt that saps my heart with strife Besets my will; And in suspended judgment never-ended, Blown up and down I suffer every ill. I have no Heaven, For I cannot know The certain glamour and the glow Which is to others all their labours' leaven; And earth denies me, and its joy defies me To seize the rest which others reap below. I wear a shroud, I cannot doff, in Mohammed's coffin. GOD'S BROOMS Out in tempest-land dear God is sweeping, sweeping, With His brooms among the glows and glooms Wrangling, while aloft the clouds are weeping, weeping, For the withered grass and buried blooms. Hark, He brushes with the wind and rushes Dirt away and poisons of decay, Probing hidden corners and forbidden Nooks with strokes that cannot go astray! Yes, while we in comfort safe are sleeping, sleeping, His behest is that of wise unrest, And His thousand brooms are sweeping, sweeping Off the ills whereby we fall opprest. Mark, how beautiful great God is sweeping, sweeping Cobwebs all from spaces great and small, And the meshes dire which would be creeping, creeping Round the cottage and the castle hall! Sentinelling us who keep rebelling, Though we stand as stewards on His land, At the scourges with which Kindness purges Seeds of sickness with a mighty hand; O while we in leisure still are keeping, keeping Every way but work at idle play, There those tireless besoms labour, sweeping, sweeping Health and order out of disarray. Not a spark escapes at length the sweeping, sweeping, Of the brooms which scatter far the dooms And disguised corruptions with their steeping, steeping Taint through all the Father's earthly rooms. Land and water and the dimmest quarter Feel them shake their bosoms and awake To a better sign than sorrow's fetter, Welcoming the wounds that do remake. Ah, though little birds in fright are cheeping, cheeping, Cuddled warm each round and fluffy form, Still the God who is the Dove is sweeping, sweeping Death and danger off with busy storm. LETTER TO A FRIEND. Expand thyself, my comrade, and be kind To all good things and scorn the local mind, Which dwells on its own spot or village pump Or glories in its pet peculiar hump And void or vices; look beyond the bound Of vestry vision, and the barren ground Where the old meanness in its fetters moves As on a treadmill through the ancient grooves And ruts; away with sour parochial pride! But leave the doors and windows in thee wide To every grace that comes however far, And do not deem thy private stain a star Or others' beauty blots. The mind is deep And soars above the petty rounds of sleep Which custom builds, and daily links or loads Along the beaten regulation roads. Look up to Heaven and know thyself as large As that, and measured by no prison marge Of cold conventions. All the earth and sky, The universe and even eternity, Belong to thee—thou art; and nothing less Than infinite, though in a mortal dress Clothed but not coffined, tied but never chained To any wheel of passion pre-ordained; With instincts more than consecrated pelf— Yea, thou art God; arise, and be thyself! In present moods and moments do not live, A purblind toy, by fancies fugitive Tost to and fro with every idle gust Or nosing like the swine amid the dust; Before and after send thy searching aims In quest of duties, not the sordid claims Which drag men down to their primordial earth And feed their hearts with hunger. Out of dearth From darkness lift thy life in thought, to be Thy better self, Divinity, and free. No more the shutters of a sheltered vice, And dismal curtains woven by prejudice That keep the shadows in and sunbeams out And throw fantastic figures with the doubt Engendered! Let the freshening breezes blow Through all the chambers of thy heart and flow Into each act and fact, the airs that fly Abroad in wingèd words of liberty, To make or break the peoples. Join the hand Of fellowship with every fair demand. And honour woman, as thou would'st a tryst With the Belovèd One, the Blessèd Christ. Nature is big, and broadens at the tread Of truth and love which into regions dead Breathe life and light; it opens its great walls, When once the honest seeker comes and calls And knocks for entrance; and it takes him in Though torn with trouble and defiled by sin, To tell him secrets and the solemn use Of higher things, the miracles profuse, The ends and issues, where the fountains flow Forth from God's feet to water worlds below. Be all with Nature, be not much with men Who travel not past their own pavement ken Or grope in gutters for some jewel; stand Upright and sunward, and about the land Look as a child might in his mother's face With confidence, who knows a foremost place Lies ever there and welcome in her arms; O commune with her kindly, let her charms And teaching be thy daily cheer and rest; Hang on her lips, and hide within her breast. But, mixed with her, thou shalt be likewise son Of God and with her and thyself at one. BLUE ROSES. I toiled for many hopeless years, And wrought of love my labour; I put my life into my lute And mingled it with happy tears, Though often I was sad and mute Beneath the tavern tabor; I suffered sore and waited long, And then mid splendid faiths and fears Beheld the unequal crown of song Go to a lucky neighbour; Though I had served and sorrowed much, And knew the master's tone and touch. The prize was for the brawler's head, And to the coarsest clamour; The humble tune, the quiet air Which had the falling roseleaf's tread And hardly guessed it could be fair Nor dreamed of its own glamour, Was flouted by the idle jest; And music that was doomed and dead And babblers in all honour drest, Exhausting even their grammar And language stores to make it much— Though mine the master's tone and touch. But still I sang my humble lays And wove the fires of summer And every flower into my lines, And gathered on my sober ways The hues and scents from secret mines Unknown to the mere mummer; I mixed the madness of the spring With red and gold of Autumn days And passion of the wild bird's wing, Undreamed of by the strummer; For, though the triflers praised him much, I kept the master's tone and touch. And thus the years went slowly by, That make and break and mellow, But deal to all their judgment due And heed no passing crown or cry; They found at length my roses blue, Amid the sere and yellow. And then they marked, with final meed, The fashion of eternity Within the lowly living seed— Not in the vulgar fellow; And while the ignorant mocked me much, I breathed the master's tone and touch. TO LEWIS MORRIS, K. B. To thee I fly, O latest Of all our Cymric Bards and greatest, Robed in a royal dress; And to the noble art Yet nobler fashioned, through the falsehoods rifted By the same touch and strong wise gentleness, And lordly lifted As to a heaven of bliss and blue. For thou hast poured the passion and the heart Of earth and sky And all eternity Into thy calm white temple, sober With conscious grandeur and the secret clue To every cosmic riddle. Roses of June, red berries of October, The reverend uses of the larger times Which rang the everlasting chimes; Not the loud modern scranny fiddle Of patriots paid To twang their loyal aid, And tunes more fitted for the tavern; High privileges, now the people's wont, Once kept like treasures in a cavern By dragon powers to grace the gilded front Of titled greed and languid lust; The universe of hope and fear Orbed in the compass of an unshed tear, With woman's warm deliciousness And lily loveliness Of pure and perfect trust; Ripe memories of old actions rich and stately When men were gods and walked sedately Within a brighter broader land, Honoured and honourable, deeming The life more precious than a perjured seeming And duty the one sure demand;— All these and many more, the numbers Wherein thou movest to the melody Part of all truth and fair philosophy, While the dull jangler of the current jargon Who bleats of oily platitudes or “argon” Reels off his vulgar rant and drinks and slumbers. But the Parnassian dew is For ever fresh and fragrant On thee, O Lewis; And thy serene and certain note, The hand which never wrote When too audacious and too vagrant A vile or vicious word, Is only seen and heard Among the chaste and choicer paths Of classic heights and deeps And golden aftermaths— It nowise halts and sleeps Nor riots in the orgies rude, But keeps unstained its own sweet solitude. To thee I gladly fly, O'ercumbered with the crude mortality For ever with us now, From sordid flesh Which laves in public sores to sin afresh— The omnipresent world, the sodden brow Of lechery that sprawls and spumes at length In bestial strength— The harlot raptures of the sexy novels Wherein the female rake unbosomed grovels With every kind of ugly antic, Naked and frantic And not ashamed, To find her proper level In dancing to the devil, Unblushing and unblamed. Lord of two worlds, who dost from singing sires Hand down the imperishable fires And at thy blest perpetual altar Burn incense meet, Without which earth had not been half so sweet Nor heaven so glad; Thou didst not in thy wildest wanderings palter, As others lightly had, With purity and faith And the eternal laws of right and wrong, For any passing wraith However crowned with garlic and renown'd, In thy calm silver song. In thee I see, no dallying with the dark And pleasures hidden, by æsthetics chidden, To all but gutter bards forbidden; But our high water-mark, Consummate, pure, Of living literature, And God's accomplished plan The flower of every culture (Not that which feeds on carrion like a vulture), The scholar and the Christian gentleman. Here my last refuge lies, Away from worship of the body And educated shame and shoddy, Which breaks our decent ties And boasts that we (however white the shirt Or sham) are chiefly dirt. Thou knowest better, Morris, and long our one unstainèd Knight Of chosen chivalry, Hast shown thyself we have no kind of fetter Short of Divinity Our dwelling-place and glory and delight. I roam among thy classic bowers And pluck the lotus Or asphodel, And hail thee as a Seer on tranquil towers Above the Night and Notus, A solitary sentinel. Thine eye is on the morning, and thy feet Outside the shade and shock Tread bases of the Rock Which anchors to the Infinite; Thy prophet glances greet, Beyond the writhings and the babble Of all this pessimistic rabble, The good, the sure, the sweet, the exquisite. No mincings and no maulings In thy clear leisured lofty verse, No prurient prattle and no bludgeoned Truth And efforts which asperse The thing they fain would bless, no caterwaulings Of crapulous gray youth Seeking it knows not what, a maid, the moon, And fitter for the cudgel and the spoon To stay its idiot cry, Than the most gentle art of Poesy. I find no refuge in our English Prose, But affectations, irritations, And popinjays' green pullulations; No march of thought to its predestined close Inevitably reached just by mere stress Of grace and reason its ally, An ordered pomp of tunefulness And mere necessity. Instead I meet but sound divorced from sense, And marriages of words not fated Or fixed in heaven but all mismated, Blunders and ignorance prepense, Adulterous unions and illicit matches Of ill-assorted pairs and patches, And fustian trimmed with purple lace, The ornaments that are a clothing For nastiness or nothing, And pimples hid not by the powdered face. In thee I have fair form, good measure, That unlearned instinct of eternal fitness, The soft assurance which bears witness To the true master's strong unerring touch, And wakes at pleasure But will not overmuch The tear or laughter. And in thy chastened and divine content I gain my own, and a new continent Of hope and rest; I cannot grieve in The doubts of dimness, but believe in Myself and all things here and God's Hereafter. MIMOSA PUDICA (Sensitive Plant). O do we see our dawning sense, the glimmer of a mind, And Shakespeare's shadow there intense, with all the wealth behind? Thy stem is not a silent tomb, for Godhead in thee dwells; And worlds are struggling in the womb of thy dim secret cells. The glories of the sage and saint dost thou thus prophesy, While we in wonder mark our faint and far-off ancestry. The shyness of the pretty maid pursued by love is such As thine, virginity afraid, which trembles at a touch. The modesty so meek and pure, though distant are its sheaves, Within thy little life secure are folded by its leaves. Thy shrinking as from look of shame, in ages hence will rush Into the blossom wrung by blame from red confession's blush. I see thee in the ghostly Past and in that ancient Dawn, Whereon our sun was feebly cast—whence this great splendour drawn; The making of the future man and full eternity, Were working in thy tiny plan and green laborat'ry. There thought had first its heavenly thrill, there dreamed the master hands; And bred thy puissant chlorophyll the brain of larger lands. The love, the passion and the joy to clothe in beauty earth, Lay in thy mystery mute and coy but waiting for the birth. The literatures and worship's cry, and unto Nature's call Our many-toned and true reply, implicit there are all. In thee I find the coming grace, the spirit and the shrine; Each atom bears, upon its face, the human form divine. THE WORM OF DOUBT. One night I passed through portals of soft sleep, Where all was silence, to a dreadful land More real than life, more sorrowful than truth, Builded of running waters on the web Of yellow sands that drift and shift and crumble For evermore beneath a yellow moon Low in a purple heaven, when a light wind Laughs; it was neither day nor night, but both Blended in one great meek and mournful dimness; The sun and its pale sister too were there, And sometimes this and sometimes that did wane Or wax and brighten or grow dull. Nor light Nor darkness held the upper hand and quenched Its rival, but a vast mysteriousness Hung over all and fretted at the heart Of everything that moved and did not move, Within this realm that was not life or death And yet partook of either. Long I looked. The sadnesses and gladnesses did fight For mastery in vain; and a mild music, Mingled with tears and muffled like the voice Of many waves, that wash a dreary shore Far far away in other times and climes, Brake on mine ears as drowsily as dreams Of poppied visions faint and wonderful, Trodden by naked maidens' pink and white Adorableness. But the speech was doubt, The spectacle was doubt, the common air Was nothing more and nothing less than doubt. Ghostly misgiving gaunt and manifold, Crept like a curse that struggled with a blessing And beat it down and breathed through alien lips A message that belonged to baser things, And triumphed in its might uncertain. Men Passed to and fro, and women beautiful And wanton some; and human and divine Children who sought for their lost infancy Like paradise but found it not, and went Without the joy of incunabula And motherhood's blue sky with timid stumbling Steps; fading in the gloom majestical And gray horizons, straying on and on Deeper and deeper, in forlornness mute. A nameless fear did haunt the doomèd place, With dismal thoughts that grew exceedingly. Nothing was constant, and no act or fact Was fixed, but might or might not be and follow The same old causes; none could guess the fruit, The burden or the issuings of work, When mirth and measured pomp's solemnities Were mixed; the morrow and the present use Seemed one in spite of differences, and past And future married strove; uncertainty Alone was certain, and in all prevailed. The inhabitants were shy, and through the shadow That had a silver seam walked up and down, In search of what they knew not, warily, With wavering feet; but none did trust another; While each was simply sure that nought was sure, And questioned his existence—if he lived Or lived not, and with aimless empty arms Toiled at beginnings and beginnings and beginnings Which had no end and no proportion. Love Died in its birth, and grim suspiciousness Grew. Words were frozen on the lips, confessed And unconfessed at once, and thought hardly Dared to lift up its eagle wings and pined For lack of food and sympathy and hope. And jealousy gnawed at the troubled breast Of barren wives, and husbands did refuse The troth which they had plighted yesterday. And God appeared a phantom, and was bodied At times in blessèd garments beautiful And incarnations of sweet Christ-likeness, Walking in human flesh; and then at times Was but a gorgeous mist, that mocked the heart And plagued the head with foolish fantasies; Who might and might not be, and was apparent And was not. The Divinity was doubt, A pious hope, a veil of vastnesses Betwixt the earth and heaven, a vague unrest, Within, without, nowhere and everywhere; Now bedrock of the mighty Multiverse, And then the thinnest wreath of thinnest cloud Inpalpable; the matrix of all things, Oceans and airs and the eternities, And yet a toy for children or a terror To chain brute force and iron ignorance down As with the weight of many atmospheres In dust of bondage. Then a horror seized My palsied soul, I did misdoubt myself; I knew and knew not aught, and everything Swooned as I swum in awful fog. The dear Kind sanities and gentle modes of usage, And daily coin of current intercourse Melted; and nothing fixed or final stayed My meaningless blind paces anywhither, From twilight unto twilight; courtesies Became a mockery and an empty play Of shadows duped by shadows, each alike Meandering through a labyrinthine maze Of idlenesses. Was I what I seemed? Did mind exist? Did matter have a root In sure reality? Was all a vision, And God and man and the whole moving mass Of systems only a great shining sham Phantasmagoria? O I tried to flee From this pursuing madness, and myself Who was not I, my friend, my foe, my pressing Shame and confusion fooling me with gawds That vanished as I grasped them. But in vain, By horror of discomfortableness Hounded, I struggled on, bewildered more And more. Till I awoke in weary dusk Of ghostly dawn to weep again, and find The worm of doubt was busy at my heart, TO THE MOST REV. DR. ALEXANDER, Archbishop of Armagh. “ARMAGH VIRUMQUE CANO.” Prelate and teacher, poet and divine, On whose broad forehead many gifts entwine Their excellences fair, I gladly bring To thee this praise and in my measure sing. Thy namesake, Lord of Hellas and the lands, Made but one world the slave of his commands; But, as they fable, in his glory fell Before a baby,—though invincible. Yet thou hast conquered every world which thought Could enter, earth and heaven itself, and fought With each great problem of all time and shed Light beautiful as day, where'er thy tread Came in its triumphs. Thou hast wrung their spoil, From darkest ages; and the deepest coil Of mysteries, in labyrinthine maze Involved path behind path with mocking haze Inextricable, yielded to thy hand Their secret treasures to less natures bann'd. By every child and child-like spirit blest, Thou winnest each and turnest fear's unrest To faith; and masking even the mitre's awe, The poet's lays and love's most righteous law Do form thy crown, to brighten with the years While hearts are young and Erin smiles through tears. THE DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE. Strong Devonshire, thy calm and equal mind Embraces each great question's tangled knot Which bares to thee the burden of its plot And hidden powers, when others all are blind; No fleeting splendour hides the fatal spot, A witness to its false unworthy kind, From that clear gaze which reads the future lot And looks before our pathway and behind. Among the wavering thou unwavering art, A pillar of this English earth and sky And precious Truth that never passes by; For statesmanship lies human in thy heart, And of our glory thou a living part Dost build the Empire broad on Liberty. ELEGY. Unhonoured thou by men but all my own, Dear heart, the better loved the better known, And truly great in gifts that fashion men To guide through conflict or in danger; then Supreme and kingly and a sheltering tower, By that calm wisdom which with heaven is power And conquers earth. Yet what thou couldest dare, None but myself might ever be aware. And now betwixt me and thy foreign grave, Rise up a thousand leagues of wind and wave With stern forbidding arms and thrust me back, If thought would try to follow thy far track And mark the footsteps. Nor can mortal trace The lowly spot that is thy resting-place; Whether among the blazing flowers that nod Beneath the blazing sky, where the palm's rod Springs like a prayer in blessing for the land Of thirst, or tossing with the tawny sand That shifts its bound and shape for ever. Still, If thy low bed be under tree or hill, My guardian love doth sweetly fence it round With benediction and makes holy ground, Where'er it be, and screens from glare and gust— Though others pass thy unremembered dust. A SYMPOSIUM OF POETS. Here, Lewis Morris, in this green and cosy umbrageous retreat, let's have a poet swing And chat of every mortal thing— We'll hold a brief Symposium. And with a sonnet catch the shy bird Bridges, Who writes so little and yet gives so much And has, with you, the architekton's touch, Serene, sedate, And marches on to his predestinate Goal, swerving not. And as June brings its midges, With nightingales and roses, let me come— Though scarce as finely feathered as are some And not in favour, Like our bold Laureate with his loyal jumping And paid tub-thumping Of courtly savour; I may be tiny but I yet can sting, And you must do the royal part and sing. Beneath my beech-trees—sub tegmine fagi— We well may pass a pleasant hour, And fancy knowledge is a power Or ignorance a costly plague; I, As here delectably we sit, Will gladly serve the wine if you the wit. You two are scholars, with a broader ken Than these poor Bumblepuppy babblers, And like brave gentlemen You take your learnèd leisure with the ease Of conscious grace and strength, And not as sordid scrabblers Who smell of garlic and but write to please; You please to write, in larger moods and strains, And grandly utter in due time at length The free and finished And rounded orb of perfect pains, With magic undiminished. No gutter mark on your sweet toil, Which breathes of moorlands and the fresh-turned soil And mountain tops, and marries Wide culture and virginity Of all untrodden ways and higher air, And carries The seal of whatsoever is most fair And true Divinity. Mud-raking lurks not here, you love it not— The reek of brothels and the blare of taverns, Corruption gilt and glorified, the spot Thrice-damned to splendour turned, and Lady Charlotte Undressed in public and adored as harlot; Your steps lie elsewhere, by the crystal caverns And tumbling waves— Afar from London gas and legs And all the treasured dregs Of pavements, music halls, and whited graves— By breezy wood, And flowers like flame that ravish and refine Or pastures golden with the celandine, Where womanhood Retains the jewels of her purity And prizes it, and deems not shame Is honour. You, O Bridges, Classic and calm upon the snowy ridges Untravelled (yet your haunt) look down futurity, And leave a heritage and name; As you, dear Cymric Bard, With the bright crown so regal and unmarr'd. No futile shaping Yours, and no mock-heroic fits, The bastard blisses and sky-scraping, The waxen lilies, paper passions, And meretricious fires and fashions, Of shoddy poets And all the little-mighty Thundertits Who rape the Muses and their manner, Half Jingoes and half Jowetts, Yet harping on the same dull string— Who strut beneath their signboard banner, But lack the vital thing. Your silver converse breaks, like wimpling waters, Upon my charmèd ears; My spirit hears Long cadences of time, that swoon and swell With the low laugh of England's daughters Among green clouds of trees Touched by a gentle breeze, Now infinite as ocean, now one shell; In the calm measured fate Of words that move to thought's own melody In it's eternity, Pure and proportionate. Alas, that I may never dare to give To others, to the world, a copy Of catholic great notes Which are your glory and prerogative; To this false age, so sham and shoppy, Which grabs at greasy votes And hands of Demos (or Arithmos) drunk With ignorance and wind and pelf, And daily lower sunk In Caliban brute worship of itself. The universe beats in each little chime Of yours, and music of all time; While their cosmography, May be summed up in one sick term pornography. Ah, hear my bees in branches pendulous Discoursing better With their unstudied music murmurous Among the flowers Of rarer souls in dim forgotten bowers; Than these that wear a fetter And call it freedom, while they dance and gabble To any tune that's set them by the Rabble Of crowned stupidity, Or insipidity, And know no feeling and no aim (Whate'er they speak and spoil and claim) Beyond the malice sour Or idle impulse of the hour. For, ah, the moment of the mean has struck The strumpet-call of lewdness, And vermin revel in the mire and muck Of unrenewedness. Yes, this white port is famous For twenty miles and more; A precious German Prince, fat ignoramus, With fifty pounds a year and rich in Rotdam In search of English money and a bride, Once tasted it and swore He never drank such royal sherry— Not he, “Ach, Gott dam!” And much he maundered of his country's pride, Her wars and Williams, and waxed merry; And then, still praising his good cheer, He asked me for cigars and beer! It has a finer fragrance Than any red, a delicate sweet note Of warmer lands, the vagrance Which comes not but from brighter suns, Where beneath cloudless blue its epic runs The stream of Camoens and he wrote. Ah, here no politics, No cant Of party cries or candlesticks And crosses or the everlasting sex! No hateful Socialistic sputter Of unwashed orators who smell and pant, No bread and butter Problems to harry us and vex The rates, no redolence of gas! No schoolboards here, To bring a red-tape atmosphere Of musty rations And all the last abominations— But vinum et in vino Veritas! Here's to a gayer earth, a broader sky For grand old English letters, And confusion To those who cramp our New Academy And their abettors With squalid pale seclusion And sickly art, Which has each mortal trick except the heart— The fringes down to the last tag, The paint and powder And every sort of purple rag, Each loop and button— Which, as it feebler wanes, yet scolds the louder. O I am more than weary, sirs, Of leperous loves and these anaemic stirs In petticoats and pinched philosophers! Art, for Art's sake, is dead as mutton— Yes, dead and damned for ever and for ever, And no endeavour Will galvanise to life that nauseous mess (Too mean for Adderlèy's gaunt clerics) Of cheap hysterics, And all imaginable filthiness. So here we found—and on a wider basis Than any passing phasis Of fashion's folly—here we found (In truth and sanity, Whate'er is fresh and beautiful and fair And walks on earth and breathes a heavenly air, On sure and solid ground) Our New Academy. Hence no appeal to any further court— This is the bar, The final and the supreme central star Which gives the first and last report, And brooks no other. For each of you will bring a brother, The fittest that he knows to make The living line of uttermost white finish Which nought can add to or diminish, In righteousness of art And with the holy heart, For love and beauty sake. And each of them will guarantee one more, Foredestined by the calling as of grace And its election to an equal place, Pre-eminent in sweet poetic lore, Among the chosen Few. And these will gather in yet two glad wearers Of golden bloom and dawn and dew, The radiant crown of song, Most gentle and most strong, Who will be too the guardians and the bearers Of that most heavenly fire Lit first at flaming founts In lightning and on legendary mounts, And handed down through ages By reverence of the sages In wonder and desire. And were my own poor hearty wish opportune, which you deny, We might have had a great Archbishop To give his blessing and paternal pressing, And the pure odour lent by sanctity; For instance, that commander Of faithful souls, the second Alexander, Who conquers far more worlds and wins a pœan Of wider praise than the Pellœan; For he, in aching lives of dearth, Has poured refreshing streams Of all enchantments and all soothing dreams And conquered Heaven as well as earth. Nor will you suffer woman, Whom I would warmly hail, To blend her weakness rich and human And perfect that which would be thus divine With what is fairest and most feminine— Although she shall prevail. You dread the “Higher Morals,” Which are a trade mark for triumphant lust Perched on our social drains, Playing with vice as babes with bells and corals, And every Scatterbrains Who would build Eve anew from dirt and dust, And prurient madam Who knows the first man was Macadam. We'll lift Poetics to its proper seat, The centre of our light and lore, A mint for but refinèd ore; No commerce whereby men do drink and eat Who only care to cheat Not charm, and fill the shop or belly (Like the primæval protoplasmic jelly) And curse our ethic ends and snore. The minor key, you say is settled For centuries, and subjectivity Played sadly out; And the new era, many-mettled, With other eyes and pure proclivity Dwells on the graces beyond doubt And gifts of the external. The pessimist is passing from the stage, With all his moans and groans profuse And self-abuse; While on the joys of the Eternal, We build the temple of a brighter age. Your lofty level speech, O Bridges, raises me in hopes Away from this thin period and the screech Of femininity And forcible and feeble in-and-inity; For like the heliotrope You turn for ever to the sun, And each fair end is a fresh work begun. But, Morris, hear the stutter Of the great owl that cannot tell the tale Borne down the endless years And big with grave arrears, Which still he strives to utter; And there the nightingale, As jealous of your richer voice And truer fiction Pours out the tempest of his benediction, And bids a better world rejoice. My wine is good, you cry—celestial tonic; I thank you much, yet yours is sweeter— But see the moonlight on that mullion!— And what Tertullian Might well have called though in a nobler sense A draught demonic And in the taste and perfume meeter, Not under-toned nor over-tense; And in your music, with you both, Nature rejected now renews her troth. Lo, we have talked the evening out, and night Has taken flight, And a serener day Is trembling in the East, A glorious feast Of gold and pearls in sweetest disarray. We hail the omen, And will accept the solemn charge A better race to run, In spite of hidden fears and many foemen— To write our history large In co-extensive thought and song, And roll a happier earth along;— Hail to the rising sun! BENEATH A SKY OF GRAMARY. I and my heart, we dwell apart From all the weary way Of ugly strife and little life With rancour and its venomed knife, And keep one holiday. We have a kingdom of our own, A greener earth, a bluer sky, To careless other looks unknown And with these mortal flowers unsown— The gracious world of Gramary. O here we rest, at every stage Of our long passion's pilgrimage; And from the Tide we step aside While onward rolls the wave, Beneath the shadows that divide The glory from its grave. And backward on the pictured Past We see the Future's vision cast In cloud and light and thunder, The feast that crowns the bitter fast, The bliss and beauty under. With stately palm and purple stream The unpathed universes gleam, Below a sky of Gramary. For thus can we alone be free, And get afar from men; Beyond the spear of cruel fear, In wedding garment white, we hear The secret of all ken. We drink at fountains fair and deep That bubble from a broader sky, Whence glimmers come to us in sleep From those great guardian souls that keep The precious pearls of Gramary. O here we turn each folded page Of our long passion's pilgrimage; We steal away at last from Time, Its fleeting tools and toys, And chant in peace the over-chime Of universal joys. And then return and then advance The buried change, the boding chance Of splendid expectation, And in their varied circumstance We see each incarnation. Without the burden and the pain Old towers and temples rise again, Beneath a sky of Gramary. SPRING. Spring, like a splendid thief, comes on the lands With sweet and subtle arts, It hangs its jewels on dead buds and brands And steals away our hearts. It runs in flame on branches pendulous With weight of many years, And wipes away with kisses amorous The cold and lingering tears. Before we know its presence a soft change Falls on decay and blight, And with a stirring beautiful and strange Moves the embodied light. It breathes with rapture on the balmy air, And to the poplar spire Steps in its glory up the rippling stair The vegetable fire. Till, beyond guessing, over the grim scars A laughing gown of green Is cast, and winter frets behind its bars And idly frowns between. For as a wedding garment earth assumes Its resurrection dress, As if it were God's laughter that illumes Eternal loveliness. POËTICS. Yes, every man of woman born To crown of thunder or of thorn, I am convinced—it is my honest credo— May do one thing which not another can, And has in him some private plan For building up or pulling down, And framing (just for his renown) A toy or death torpedo. And each of us, hitched to reality, Possesses still To use or lay aside at will A glorious individuality, Unlike the rest and all apart and fair However slight or simple it may be, Hung upon golden hair Or like a splendid ocean broad and free; A spacious song To roll the weary world along, And set a thousand hearts on fire With stern magnificence of hate At evil fate, Or love of beauty and divine desire; A talent Worth finding and worth using and worth telling, Which never will be given again— For thus the Powers ordain— To gentle wisdom or imperious youth, And might make earth more gay and gallant Or kindle sunshine in a brother's dwelling; A truth, Which would be falsehood to a different mind, But here could turn all nations kin and kind. Yet most, the millions, Are quite content to eat and drink and sleep And at their petty tasks in squalor creep Or ride on pillions Behind the noisy Few who lead and lie, And then (not coming to their own) To neighbours and themselves unknown, Decay and die. And there the treasure goes with them, is lost, An undiscovered land Though ripe and ready to the hand, Which by them only could be crost; And the full grace and blessing Not for a single class But the great total mass— The book, the picture, The deed of light like God's supreme caressing, The red-hot stricture Which blasts to ashes the brute wrong However throned and diademed and strong— These and a thousand more, That might have grandly lifted The multitude of toilers unto rest And higher levels, adding to the store Of happiness and learning and rich art, Or rifted The ragged clouds and shown the bright and best; That should have striven to humanise the heart With all its rudeness And clothe in comely garments nudeness, Or sound a science or new chord Which predecessors failed to reach and raise Out of the darkness unto dawn and praise, Or whet a saving sword— These quite unheard, with their sweet languages, Pass into the cold Silences Unsyllabled, and the grand sum of things Is so much poorer for their unwaked springs. And I, Who move unhonoured among men, Am still a player needed Though all unheeded, If but by some rejected song or sigh Or little touch of an obscurer pen, To round the orb of labour and bring heaven Just one thought nearer, And be an atom of the secret leaven Fermenting in the minds of those who toil And make earth dearer. I, too, a factor In the broad compass of the land and sky, Do yield my measure of the power or oil To the great wheels and piston rods, A hidden but inevitable actor Amid the legions that are God's Upon the platform of Eternity. The giant in me romps And asks for revels, Though he may sport alike with babes and devils, And pageantries and varied pomps; He fain would sprawl his giant length About an endless canvas in profusion Of all sweet colours, and assay the strength Which is his weakness and his joy, And treat the universe as though a toy— Yet, after every form Or freak of tranquil ease and storm, Be quite as far from the conclusion. Let others drag in the old ruts, Or hoop themselves in meagre butts Of wine they turn to water; I want a larger space, A continent or two for my embrace And not the curled and scented quarter Of some small fraction, As tame and tiny as a lady's lap, Wherein to feed on sugarplums and pap And serve the silken reins of idle traction. I have big notions, Not narrowed to mere Matins and devotions, But wide as is the world of being And deep as the abyss of hell— Yes, sometimes with a brimstone smell— And gathering in the purview of its seeing The honest mud, and not by ounces, As much as furbelows and flounces And midnight shapes Like monstrous owls and bats And beetles and Egyptian cats, With sunrise and sunsetting, And not forgetting Our oldest friends, the blest anthropoid apes. I hold Poetics To be the mirror of each mortal thing— Your skeleton, your dear wife's apron string, Your private mole, Your comicals as well as your pathetics; Not quite the cinder-hole, Or cesspit or the gutter; For there I draw a decent line, And bar our ethics and the true Divine Within a shade and shutter. I do believe in good taste and good morals And leave the dirty capers To d——d Religious Papers, And grand young men who yet are cutting Their teeth and new opinions On babies' corals Throughout the Press in our too free dominions, Or roar their time of rutting. I duly try to catch The perfume and the passion as they flower, The one sweet moment, if a smear Of glory on some cottage latch, The moonlight on a mossy tower, A terrible tear Which in the shadowed light looks red as blood, Like sweat of gray Gethsemane— Love at its topmost flood, And in calm woods the coy anemone A fallen star. But, though I never veil the scar Which has a grace and is a gem of jewels According to its range, I do not rashly blaze it out Exposing it to study strange; I leave the maid her crewels, Her pretty zone and pout And magic dimple— I wish her to be clean and simple. From those who lightly tear the figleaves off And make of purity their scoff Or gloat in coarse excesses And squirmings of mere lewd undresses, I turn with loathing As from the dunghill and the awful reek; My soul is vexed With vice made sweet and virgins all unsexed, And the rouge-plastered cheek— I want a creed and clothing. AS THE LIGHT. As the light from any star drops, on beauty bloom or scar; As the colour from the rose falls, where'er it may repose; As the music of the bird bubbles out, when it is stirr'd; As the glory of the streams breaks, in laughter, from its dream; All because they do and must, for the diamond or the dust;— So my heart of many strings, out of sweet compulsion sings. Others fashion what they can, by an ordered code or plan; Cut their yewtrees into shapes, mimicking the owls and apes; To a calm amended form, chiseling the fire and storm; Worshipping each door that shuts, while they plod impatient ruts; Fastening fancy to a string, clipt in each rebellious wing; Yet I cannot choose but fly, from a dear necessity. Breezes blow by inward right, on the mission of their might; Waves, that kiss the clasping shore, wed as they have wed before; Suns and moons for ever shine, through a dower that is Divine; Darkness, over waste and town, lets the same soft curtain down; Every life obeys its law, whether world of worlds or straw; So my numbers wake or sleep, pulsing as the tidal deep. Melody is soul of me, made to carol wild and free; Like the lark upon the wing, that must either die or sing; Like a furnace that will burn, though it be its funeral urn; Like a careless noisy wind, fresh from perfumed paths of Ind; Like a wilful boy at play, laughing, crying all the day; Like the bee that honey hives—just because its nature drives. THE BLIND GODDESS. Long and lush the grasses, summer-sweet the hay Where my Goddess passes on her destined way, Kindly, blindly, with the world at play. In the grateful shadows of the clouds, that shed Pearls about the meadows, is her happy tread, Dancing, glancing lightly overhead. O her garments rustle, in the winds that sweep With a pretty bustle from the lands of sleep, Walking, talking old enchantments deep. In the murmur rising out of gorse and ling, Where a-moralizing bees are on the wing Madly, gladly, hear her bosom sing. Blackbirds in the hedges conquered by her charm Peeping from the edges perch upon her arm, Wary, chary, but not in alarm. Yellow-breast and sparrow come to her who feeds, Daisy and rest-harrow know not they are weeds, Clasping, grasping her immortal seeds. Stone and lady's bedstraw feel and find her much, Withered leaf and dead straw may not linger such, Hoping, groping for that heavenly touch. Crystal water glasses her all-conquering eyes, As the Goddess passes to her native skies, Weaving, leaving open mysteries. THE RED COCK. The red cock crowed, Before the day; And sullenly the river flowed, But could not wash her sin away. She stood upon the bitter bank— Alas, for her!— And fiercely of its fury drank, While angry grew the wind and cold That caught her pretty hair of gold And gossamer. But yet she was afraid to die, And break the last sweet lingering tie. A distant bell, Declared the hour; But to a spirit half in hell It idly spake, and had no power. The rushing waters charmed her ear— Alas for love!— And mingled with a joyous fear The passion of an evil choice, That drowned the dim and better voice From lands above. And O she was afraid to live, With crime that man could not forgive. The red cock crowed, Before the light; And dark the debt, that folly owed, Loomed in the horror of the night. But all the billows of the sea— Alas, for sin!— If they should hearken to her plea, Could never make her stormy breast Once more a happy home of rest, And pure therein. But was there cleansing in the fire, To perfect thus a new desire? A horned owl Slid slowly by, The watchdog raised a ghostly howl And then again, it knew not why. The purging of the folded flame— Alas, for her!— Might heal the sickness of her frame, Or set in tune each jangled part And fashion her discordant heart A dulcimer. And in the furnace lay a spell, To save a spirit even from hell. The red cock crowed, And loud and long; Stars here and there with promise sowed The heavens, as if repairing wrong. They were the wanted sign, that gleamed— Alas for guilt!— Down on a soul bemired and seamed; And, at the sight of rifted cloud, Her nature rose to stature proud As though rebuilt. She was not then afraid to die, When she had found a fairer tie. And homeward now, She turned her feet; Unearthly light was on her brow, And tinkled music in her feet. Unto the old ancestral hall— Alas, for shame!— Hearing that secret solemn call, She went on strange ecstatic wings To seek in awful communings Another name. She was not then afraid to live, And felt that God could thus forgive. The red cock crowed, From tumbling fire; And in the shadows' tumult showed, A woman clad in meek attire. The crested waves were o'er her head— Alas for her!— And made a carpet for her tread; They bathed her breast, and every surge Was with the scathing of its scourge Death's minister. God only knew, if from her mean And broken life they washed her clean. THANATOS. Give me more flesh, I am a-hungered still For lives of men cooked in their own red gravy; And virgins fresh Carved till their rose-dew spill, With luscious lips and tresses gold and wavy. My drowthy chaps are dry, My lips agape For warm sweet draughts of goodly human juices; Come, let the bullets fly And none escape, Now war has opened wide its wounds and sluices. These famished ribs Are fretting for the wash, Sweated by bleeding breasts in seas of slaughter; Your baby cribs, The dearest cannot quash A raging lust that riots without quarter. My mouth is but a tomb Which nothing sates, And (if you give it all) keeps wider growing; Within its greedy womb Lurk cruel hates, That set the stream of strife for ever flowing. Hurry, my hounds Of war, that gather fast And cheer me with the music of your crying; Despising bounds And glories of the past, Batten on bodies of the dead and dying. Tear me the pleasant pulp Of quivering frames, And bury deep your fangs in heart and liver; O for the gurgling gulp Of tongues like flames, While blood goes running like a merry river. I listen long, And weary for the joy Of tortured sobs and sighs and breastbones cracking; Be brave and strong To ravin and destroy, Mid wrath of fire and smoke and curse of sacking. Ah, glut your savage thirst With dreadful tears, And dainty morsels and delicious marrow; I go before you first In shadowy fears, To shake the lands that these shall haunt and harrow. The time is late, And I have fasted sore While peace was hanging high its lazy laurels; But now my Fate Falls on the pampered store, And finds its love and life in crimson quarrels. Behold the destined hour, Wherein I sup Of murdered meats as once on fatted Abel; Pay to my sceptred power The gory cup, And with fresh corpses pile my banquet table. Bring me more slain To feed this parching maw, And give me thousands of the mute and mangled; I feast on pain, And lay no kinder law Than choking breath and bosoms stilled and strangled. Come, at each others' throats, My victims, fly And wreak the sins that may not be repented; My passion thrives and gloats On butchery, And were I filled I were not thus contented. TRUTH UNVEILED. Truth stood before me—and my mouth was mute— White-bosomed, sweet and sole, and absolute; Intolerably pure in soft undress, Clothed with the light of naked loveliness. Immortal life shone from her calm gray eyes, That looked on me like twin eternities; And her low voice, dim as forgotten tears, Dropt music of the immemorial years And in a moment down the stream of Time Bare me with chant of its unearthly chime. Flamed in her hand a lily, and at the rest And gracious heaven of her uncinctured breast, One jewel brake into ten thousand beams Mixed with the marvels of all dazzling dreams And dear familiar sights. I gazed at her, Frail as a form of golden gossamer And still more strong than bases of the Deep, Mingled of madness, dawn, and poppied sleep And dew and fire; and into me her might Burned, with the glory of a great delight And virgin bloom and passion of pure ken; While the red rose of lips unkissed by men Moved as in blessing, and at last I heard (What none may live and name) the secret word, That taught me how she married in one breath The mystery of ancient life and death. But now I read the riddle of all Time Known and unknown to every creed and clime, And earth can never be the same to me When earth is heaven and beautiful and free And heaven is earth. Most luminous I mark The thread of light through the untravelled dark And mapt-out chaos, and with joy I stand A lonely watcher in a waiting land; Because I have the clue of things, and know Where the ways meet, and hear the grasses grow. ETERNAL NOTHING. For years I sought a fleshly God, And gave Him every gift but trust; I wallowed for Him in the dust, And abject in His temple trod. I deemed such services were fit And pleasant to the Awful Shade, Which mine own hands had feebly made— They thought to cramp the Infinite. I bathed this Phantom with my tears, And gloried in the earthly dress Of His exceeding littleness, A reflex of my coward fears. I wondered often why I knew No comfort, out of land and sky, From this poor creature Deity Which only of my meanness drew. He seemed so helpless and as blind As human nature on its lees, And hungering less for faith than fees, Unkin though kin and most unkind. He never lifted me by love Into the realms past mortal air, Where all is very calm and fair, And set me at His side above Then I renounced my God of clay And sought another in the Land Which wears no common bound or brand, Betwixt the worlds of night and day. And of the Silence did I ask What laid its redness on the rose, Or breathed the rapture in repose And hallowed every time and task. But, lo, the stillness made reply, From dim retreats of nature nude And its eternal solitude— “Behold, in me, Divinity.” And thus I learnt from truthful lips The secret which alone could save, And wider was than creed or grave, The last great dread apocalypse. I found a solace in the thought,— That labour was, to love in vain And passion but an idle pain, When at its bases All was Nought. And so I crave for nothing more, Beyond the present and its power; I take each moment at the flower, And fret not for some fancied Shore. Ah, it is utter peace to know Betwixt the trouble and the tear No kingdoms lie or far or near, And the above is the below. Thus, as a baby at the breast Which sucks its daily sustenance Nor heeds the hidden circumstance, Faith drinks from fountains mute and blest. What future morns may grudge or give To purpose that would do or dare, I now no longer ask or care— It is enough for me to live. MOTHER EARTH. My Mother Earth, I prize thee best, For I was suckled at the breast Which bears thy children food; And on me closed thy kindly arms Which suffered every mood, And unveiled to me all the charms Of gentlest motherhood. Nor can I flee away from love Which lives so very near, Betwixt the toil and tear; It holds me up, and smiles above Down on my foolish fear. My Mother Earth, I have no bliss So precious as thy morning kiss, Upon my brow and cheek; And though thou art exceeding strong None ever was so meek, And thy most tender cradle song Gives what the children seek. I am rebellious, but I know Thy Sweetness wraps me round With music more than sound; And every place I tread below, Is home and heavenly ground. My Mother Earth, thou dost abide With me, whatever fate betide; And at thy bosom still I hang, an infant, and I draw Alike in good and ill That sustenance which is the law And worketh by thy will. When other sources must go dry And Cherith's brook has past, Thy cherished fountains last; The milk is of eternity, And mingles with my fast. My Mother Earth, this heart shall lie Upon thee, when I seem to die; Then is more truly near The presence of that awful Power, And most divine and dear; For my whole being then shall flower, Nor heed the changing year. This nature, which was formed from thee, Now prisoned in the flesh And lost in many a mesh; Shall wax all beautiful and free, And bloom with thine afresh. THE CRIME OF CREATION. Alas, That I being God should greatly sin And let a world of woe begin, That shall not lightly pass! Oh I repent me In framing but the mockery of man, I so unbent me From the grand purpose of my glorious plan As to delight in something less than All, And dabble with the incomplete and sport With such creation; Which only was foredoomed to fall From its first brightness, and come short And find damnation. Yea, I have sinnèd sorely, and through Time Must bear the burden of my grievous crime And fatal error, In toil and terror; To expiate, on an unceasing Cross And by the torment of a daily death Which cannot die, And in the shadow of a lonely loss Which cannot lose, The evil which will never be atoned, Till man with God at last has been enthroned. I must draw on the insufferable breath, Because I choose To be Divinity And cannot 'scape the horror of Infinity, Nor one small drop of that wherein I drown, Which is alike My bitter curse and crown. Alas, That I may not undo the wrong Wrought on the clay that issued from My moulding And pictured Me though in a broken glass, With fragments of the heavenly song; Which could not bear the folding Of iron arms and evils, And met with all-unequal front Legions of dooms and devils, Intextured in the web of hourly wont. And could that fragile being, When darkness was its seeing, Cope with the crushing weight of sleepless foes For ever camped round his unarmoured walls, Temptations which were leagued with native lust Rooted in dust, And bearing fruit of fatal woes Or falls? In other tracks and times And with a loftier making Man might have stood against the storm Of clouded climes, And reared erect a stainless form With no necessity of breaking; He might have gathered sweeter grace And in the grandeur of his godlike serving, Undimmed by swerving, Shown some bright shadows of My own fair Face. Alas, That now the creature thing and the Creator Should have reversed their portions quite, And man is the real educator With Me a pupil in his class; If I may, through æonian pain, Somehow regain The old lost Beauty infinite! For he, in sorrows vast and various And death vicarious, Atones for Me and on My Cross For ever hangs In mortal pangs, That purging from him all the dross He might redeem Me from the station Of guilty grief, And bring in turn the ripe relief Of full salvation. For he whom I threw lightly out From sheer exuberance of Strength, Into a Kosmos dark with doubt And rank with every shape of trial, As helpless as a babe new-born, Shall be at length My rescuer from a fate forlorn By his denial; And I the Potter, When it has gone the weary way Through the red furnace heated seven times hotter, Shall be re-fashioned by the clay And issue from this awful cerement, Saved by the love of man my lost experiment. My cup is now already sweeter, Though I must drink it to the bottom lees In utter shame And feel My Name But a reproach, from which God flees Yet hides not, and thus grows completer. They deem I died once only, But God is always dying And always sad and lonely; Yea, in the wounded creature's sobs My Voice, And even the baby's crying Re-echoes from my lips and through My Heart So haunted yet apart. And man, who could not have a virile choice In his own dim creation, Consigned at first to weakness, Still greatly has forgiven His Maker now the Made And now no more unshriven; Till, as from waters of regeneration And by the path of meekness, I shall arise with Him from winter shade, Unto new glories vernal; And man shall reign with Me upon the Throne, No longer God alone, Co-equal, co-eternal. THE SKYLARK. Heaven is thy home, and thou a passing guest Who leaves a pilgrim song and lightly holds All melodies of Time within his breast, And feels the passion which his heart enfolds. For thou, returning to thy native sky, Dost carry with thee our humanity Tuned to the rapture of a deeper rest, Which none but he who rises thus beholds. The dew of Nature and the bloom of things Fall from the shining of thy shaken wings, And some may catch mid earthlier revelry Great gleams of awful overshadowings. Earth is thy cage, like disimprisoned flame Thou soarest upward to the kindred fires, And worlds' wide passion trembles in that flame Which mirrors man and infinite desires; The future poem, to be said or sung, Makes music in that universal tongue In notes unborn that still shall have a name, And tells each heart to what its hope aspires. Thou art the distant morning's pearly gleam, The secret message of the murmuring stream, The call of bells that never yet were rung, And the white soul which throbs through every dream. NO LAURELS. He needs no laurels for his head, He needs no vulgar shouts of men; He liveth still and is not dead, All history shall be his pen. His name was sculptured not in stone Nor blazoned by the painter's art, He asked no crumbling crown or throne And dwells in every human heart. He let the soldier trace in blood The paltry triumph of a day, For revolutions' rising flood To sweep it and his sword away. He let the statesman's gilded lie Flaunt for a moment at its power, And then in shame and shadows die With other creatures of an hour. He let the poet idly sing Of visions past and vain as clouds, And fawn as lacquey to a king Or shape for patriots their shrouds. While for himself he was the slave Of all and bare the people's ban, And thus for evermore his grave Is but the grateful mind of man. THE WILDERNESS OF SIN. I wandered through the Wilderness of Sin, By stock and stone and evermore alone, Where the black fountains of the earth begin; The ground was iron, the heaven above seemed brass, A lost wind wailed a little while and failed And shivered life out on the dry dead grass; Gaunt blasted rocks rose threatening in the air They vainly pawed, with lean arms fire-begnawed And writhings frozen into dumb despair; While stunted trees put forth their withered hands, And on my march a fated funeral arch Hung here and there like spent infernal brands. The silence cursed me as I struggled on, Across the dust that was a quaking crust Of gloom through which the glare of torment shone; And scorched my feet and scourged my flagging might The dark salt scurf, that tossed its troubled surf Up to the shadow that was all the light; And then at times a shudder pierced the globe As doth the chill before the the corpse is still, And dying nature round it draws its robe; And yet I trod the Wilderness of Sin With steadfast face set towards the resting-place, And proved that Heaven and hell were close akin. BLIND LOVE. I sit in the darkness ever lone, As the pretty ladies pass, But I see not one In my day foredone, Though I drink of the life beneath the stone And the passion in the grass; O I hear the rustle of silken frocks, And catch the breath from their perfumed locks That speaks of their beauty after; And a shadow of that great world so high For a moment comes in its glory nigh, With the ripple of love and laughter. But I make me pictures of what I hear, And I paint them with colours true In my twilight hush Till its chambers blush, And my bosom leaps with a blissful fear At their burning light and heavenly hue; For I know that the things of earthly mould, Whether jewelled silver or sanguine gold, Have not half their fire or sweetness; And I get at the heart of the human whole, While the secret treasure reveals its soul As my thought gives the fair completeness. But of all the broken or brimming strains That do visit my world of night, Where my spirit feels The old cosmic wheels And the giant forces that fret their chains, There is one that is pure delight; It is just the river of crisping sound And the trailing skirts that kiss the ground, As the ladies pass my prison; Like the lisp of leaves and the falling snow With the babbling brooks that gently flow, And the flowers of Spring new-risen. Yet among the myriad steps that trip, And amid the voices dear Which are more than song In that scented throng, Is a radiant form with a rosier lip And a purpose calm and clear; I should tell her foot in a thousand feet With its rythmic pulse, and prove it sweet With its human care and kindness; For my nature glows and is not the same, And her presence turns my frost to flame Till it blooms in its lonely blindness. THE BRIDE OF THE SNOW. She went across the purple hills, Amongst the haunted rocks and rills Her playmates from of old; She trod the dear familiar track By toppling stone and tumbled wrack, To call the sheep she tended back Safe to the sheltering fold. Then dimly from the chambered air, A ghostly form of dark despair Slid out of awful caves; The grim gray death came wrinkling down Upon her like a corpse's frown, As if it dared again to drown The world in greedy waves. The shapeless mist a shadow grew, And forth on wings of horror flew That challenged to the strife; The earth and sky no longer twain Mixed in a common pulse and pain, And with the bondage of one chain Bound every breath of life. She lay upon the pall-clad hills Dressed out with pure white fairy frills, As in her wedding gown; While yet on upturned virgin face And on each tender gift and grace, Where love had throned its dwelling-place, The gray death wrinkled down. The laugh was frozen on her lip, By the remorseless iron whip That stung the very blood; The light was clouded in the eye, That stared right through the veilèd sky As into dumb eternity; And grimmer rose the flood. She never fetched the lost sheep home, But under that great leaden dome The tempest tucked her in; As on her marriage bed she lay, Her golden head as chill as clay, Her little feet no more at play And snowflakes kist her chin. THE FRIEND OF MAN. I love to feel the shadows near and dropping closer round, And worms with cold caresses drear—it is a pleasant sound. O joy, to know the sexton Time is scooping out my grave, And digging from the dust and grime the cell my bones will pave! His greedy pick is hard at toil, and deepening as it likes; And when it breaks the sullen soil, in every hour it strikes. Why should I be afraid of Death, who ever to his law Am witness in each weary breath of labour that I draw? Moment by moment something flies that waxed with tardy pain, Moment by moment something dies that shall not be again. Unless I daily die in flesh, and of my substance give For bioplasts to weave afresh, I may not, must not live. Death is no stranger presence new with doings veiled and dim, For with my growing frame he grew and I am known to him. He is my oldest dearest friend and shared my every pace, The earliest seen and to the end the most familiar face. We both ate from a common plate and lay within one bed, Bound tightly by no differing fate and by each other fed. And so I love the merry strife of darkness and decay, That show the partners death and life are never far away. I hear the music as they meet with more than bridal kiss, And play in rapture swift and sweet above the mute abyss. I love to see the ruin sport about the base of night, That nearer rocks my wreck to Port—it is a pleasant sight. THE BABY KING. On a throne more broad than ever Rome or England wrought With their armed and iron endeavour And imperial thought, Sits the latest and the greatest Flower of this triumphant time, In the glory of his court Beautiful and bright and short; While all ranks of every clime, Wealth of worlds and praises' chime Are to him but fleeting sport. When he sleeps the earth is quiet Stepping on tip toes, When he wakes delicious diet Soothes his thirsty throes; Men are making, hearts are breaking Just to please his idlest whim For a moment or a day, As a bubble blown in play; Hands may labour, eyes grow dim In their faithful watch for him, While he goes his careless way. For the weaving of his vesture Toil the weary lands, And his faintest nod or gestures Are supreme commands; At his babble, Prince and rabble Both alike obedient bend; And his least most trifling looks, To the farthest darkest nooks Edicts universal send; And his fits of silence blend, With the lore of learnèd books. Sword and needle, man and beasts Owning as their law Each low lisping, spread him feasts Grudged to armies' awe; And to weakness grant with meekness All the tribute earth can yield, All the Heaven itself may bring, Gold and diamonds, angel's wing, Fruit of Eden, bloom of field, Thunder throat of shell and shield— For the world's wee Baby King. THE PANTHEIST. Creation steps from pose to pose, There was a thistle—is a rose, But not commencement, not a close. No separate life has ever stood, The stone is beautiful and good, And heaven is all in womanhood. I see the whole of Nature's spell, Hid in the shaping of a shell— The colour of a blossom's bell. Nor could I for a moment live, Did not the Maker freely give To all His full prerogative. He is as much in every drop Of dew that bends the spicule prop, As in the mighty mountain top. I feel Him in the thronèd thought, No less than in the Empire wrought Through strife across the ages fought. I know the total sum of things Is everywhere, in insect wings, And faintest air of golden strings. I find the glamour of the globe In violet's breath, the surgeon's probe, The rustling of a maiden's robe; And in the second that goes by, With but a new-born baby's cry, The passion of Eternity. While I am in each humblest part And one with Nature and with Art, The Universe is in my heart. And I am God and God is I, For ever far, for ever nigh, Within the sun, within the sigh. The earth is but the shifting dress, Through pain and joy's more sad caress, Of the Eternal Loveliness. And nought there is that cannot say, While life and death together play, “Behold, I sup with God to-day.” He is the star, the crumbling clod, The beggar's crutch, the prophet's rod, And all in all and always God. LOST AND LOVED. Do you mark that little mound of green Where the daisies grow and glimmer up, Like a wave of sorrow hardly seen In the glory of the buttercup? There she lies in that deep furrow Very calm and cold, Where strange creatures breed and burrow In her mortal mould. Ah, the clammy kisses of the rain Fall upon what was her gentle brow, But she feels no longer pulse of pain In the grimness of her dimness now. There she silent rests in that Dead Sea, Frozen, who was once all heavenly fire, And the passion of my empty plea Wakes no answer from her still desire. In and out the ruined chamber Of her blessed bones, Things of horror creep and clamber As amid dumb stones. And those lashes long and dark and dear Curtaining her glad and glorious eyes Cannot bear the burden of a tear, When her beauty from its duty flies. Ah, she loved me as but woman can Pouring out the richness of her heart, Though the compass of its mighty plan Touched me not, unvalued and apart. As the night-flower sees the splendour Merely of the moon, Not its fellows, she did render Me alone her boon; Shone for me in shadowed time and place In the danger, as no other would, And betwixt me even and death's embrace In the trial and denial stood. Now too late I find the treasure past, Light and tenderness beyond all name, Sympathy that like an ocean vast Lapped me in its mingled faith and flame. Low she sleeps and mutely presses Other lips than mine, While the worm with fond caresses Clasps that face divine. And upon the bosom where I lay Heedless of the jewel in my hand, Lie the mouldering dust and miry clay And grief only for the lonely land. INFANCY. Thou art outside this fretting world of woe Wherein we helpless sink, And playest on the brink Untouched by fortune and unharmed by foe; O dweller not in time with care and crime, To whom our toil and trouble Which thought makes dark and double Are but the echo of a distant chime; On thine authentic ear Breaks never pulse of fear, And those pure feet that flutter as they fly Wash in the waters of Eternity. Thou art above the tumult and the strife Through which we hardly strain, And babblement of pain Or pleasure mixes not with that far life; We suffer and we sin and fall therein To rise yet with the morrow, But past the reach of sorrow Thou art enthroned where all sweet founts begin; No future and no past On thee their shadows cast, Who clingest to the present as a toy Wrapt in thy primal privacy of joy. Thou art a watcher with us, but not yet Quite of our muddy maze And this poor mortal haze, In which we never see the suns till set; Work has no meaning now for that bright brow, And thine is but one measure For loss and gain of treasure And broken plaything, heart or vow; Thou readest on a stage The pictured title page Of Nature's book, where universe and bee Are both the same—a spectacle for thee. Thou art still one with all the Orient things Where it is only morn, And thought is not a thorn But wandering in blue skies of angel wings; And at thy blessèd feet so white and sweet Are kisses and caresses, And dear first lovelinesses In adoration and low laughter meet; Before the parting ways Thy fancy lightly strays, There is no burden to thine infant breath— No mystery in married life and death. ICHABOD. The glory has departed from the village, The country-side once fruitful now looks bare, And broods above the wreck of former tillage A shadow more than care; The ploughshare rests and rusts within the furrow, And on the bosom of the very plough The lark has made its nest, and rabbits burrow Beneath the golden bough With apples big and pendulous, and thistles Array their hostile spears and stand to arms Among old Edens, and the blackbird whistles To dimmed and dreary charms. The conquering pick is dumb, and dark the splendour Of work that early toiled and troubled late, And made the niggard soil at last surrender Its wealth a willing rate. The labourer has fled the land, which brightened Beneath his touch and lost its surly frown, And the green robe of grace his culture heightened Is but a russet gown; The grass is growing where the path was trodden Hard with the daily round and frequent feet, And like a drownèd face the scene is sodden With rot and rain unmeet. The cottages are vacant, through the village No pulse of echoing steps is heard or known, As if the ruthless passions of red pillage Had wrath and ruin sown; No beautiful and brown dear country daughter To meet the lover with a heart of flame, Goes forth as timid as a lamb to slaughter In crown of crimson shame; No babble of rude voices at the turning Breaks on the traveller as he passes by, But desolation speaks with dismal yearning And cannot get reply. The barn-door creaks on dull complaining hinges At every buffet of the peevish blast, And the stray dog that in the corner cringes Finds here a hopeless fast; The thatch is peeling from the roof and tumbles In idle litter on the empty yard, And sombre styes which the same sentence humbles Are wan and weather-scarred; The boards with wet and frost are torn and tattered And scarcely hung together yet hold on, While up rise walls a framework bleached and battered— A gaunt ribbed skeleton. The rake is silent and the rumbling barrow No longer groans its dusty drudging way, And in the teeth of the deserted harrow Unnoticed vermin play; No horses plod the fields or in the stable Stamp as they munch the welcome measured corn, And from the lattice in the ivied gable No faces flash with morn; The rats have fled the threshing-floor, and idle Flap shutters in the old unshielded spots, And where once dangled polished bit and bridle The mildew rests and rots. The church is closed for ever and the steeple Has ceased to point the upward path to God, And those calm porches by a reverend people No more are duly trod; Through shattered windows climbs the trailing creeper And to the very altar rail it clings, While no clear kindly voice to wake the sleeper Now from the pulpit rings; And slimy things have scribbled on the arches Strange letters dank in solitude and dusk, And ruin slowly through its riot marches As worms within the husk. The rectory stands all dolorous in welter Of grim decay which on it darkly lies, For generations long a homely shelter Of hospitalities; Which opened ready arms to sin and sorrow And took pale poverty in its warm breast, Until the saddest there forgot the morrow And reaped a vital rest; But now that common sanctuary is broken, And chaos from the gray and tottering walls Grins like a gaping skull the doom unspoken And revels as it falls. The over-burdened land with tolls and taxes Can yield no further round of grateful food, Though care and skill have nursed the fields and axes Been busy in the wood; The soil requites no trust of toil or money, And so the spade that conquers earth has sped, While vainly ripen fruits and bees for honey Lie in the lily's bed; The curse has come and with its barren blighting Spoils every work of man with fetid breath, And summer suns that laugh are only lighting The downward road to death. THE MIDNIGHT TRYST. The gray mouse squeaked in the old church tower Drearily, wearily; And the wandering wind felt the dead hand's power, As it moaned to the breast of the midnight flower Messages, presages; When the Bridegroom past on the troubled blast, And the rose looked up with a redder cup To grieve that its roots were all earth-fast; While the bats were scrawled on the purple sky Chittering, flittering, And the owl to his mate made hoarse reply Serious, mysterious. But his grave stood wide like an opened shell Quivering, shivering; And a moonbeam pale with its finger fell On the dusky door, and the great church bell Tolled the hour, knolled the hour; There was mist for the moth and its white grave-cloth Lay on plenty and dearth and above the earth As on some cold face, but his dear love-troth Was deeper than death and it drew him forth Mightily, flightily; To pursue his Bride, and from south to north Hastened him, chastened him. But the ivy waved its flag on high Presently, pleasantly; And her passing soul with a sudden sigh Through the church-door fled, as the Bridegroom nigh Sought for her, fought for her; But the silence then as of murdered men With the tangles green slipt right between, And she sadly dropt from his cheated ken; But with hungry hand and his lone blind feet Painfully, strainfully, O he hurried yet for that shadow sweet Haunting him, taunting him. Through the brush and brier and poppied lea Shimmering, glimmering In its mantle soft like a starlit sea He went out in his search with a piteous plea Ceaselessly, peacelessly; Over wood and wold, as he did of old When he chased her on in the centuries gone, He followed her back to the churchyard mould. And the red cock crew at the dawning day Lustily, dustily; In their several beds again they lay Set till night, yet till night. THE NEW YEAR. Cometh up like a flower the New Year, Goeth out like a ripe sheaf the Old— Like a sheaf with the blighted and true ear, And its medley of mildew and gold. The young fashion is feeble and slender, Though its roots are all planted in Love And lay hold of Eternity's splendour, But the heavens are curtained above. Cometh up like a flower in shadow and shower To the burdens of care and of crime, For the sorrow and sinning and terrible winning, A new rose in the gardens of Time. Cut it down in its bud, saith the Reaper, Ere it rise to full stature and strength And the charms that we prize have grown cheaper, Or the worm of decay saps at length! Cut it down before evil's intrusion, Lest its crown be of dust and confusion. Cometh up like a flower the New Year, Goeth out like a dead sheaf the Old Carried off when it climbed to the true ear, With the life that returned to the mould. O the grace that is modest and little Yet is drawn from the worlds beyond sleep, And the petals though pallid and brittle Do arise from the infinite Deep. Cometh up like a flower in promise of power And dim shoots that upturn to the light, With the thorn and the thistle and brier and bristle A new rose from the gardens of night. Let it live awhile yet, saith the Reaper, While I water with tears the young faith Which despises the charms that are cheaper And each gawd with its glittering wraith! Let it live in its pitiful weakness, Till it gives me the harvest of meekness. LOOKING BACK. When I look back upon my life It seems a little thing, Less than the moment's dust and strife Stirred by an insect's wing— A cloud of foolish efforts rife With empty murmuring; Confusion dull of babbling sound Which went the same unceasing round, Each idle hour and day; The bubble of a play In one familiar fated bound, Which fooled its wealth away. And as I pause beside the edge Where all at length must stand, The earth seems just a crumbling ledge Outside the better land, It cannot give the soul a pledge More solid than the sand. The love, for which I fiercely fought, So hardly won with tears, was nought— A bauble or distress, And cold the dear caress; Hope was a wrecker's light, and thought The curse of consciousness. ON THE KNEES OF THE GODS. Throned on their thunder heights calmly the Great Gods sit, Veiléd in dreadful lights, ruling the laws unwrit; Solemn and lone, each on his throne, Awful and infinite. Up in the glory sacred and hoary, reading the story Lived by the peopled lands, Turning the pages which are the ages in the earth stages With their imperial hands. Far beyond care and crime guarding what no man sees, Issues of every time, fruitage from all the trees; Silent they hold the counsels old, Safe on their judgment knees. Strong above noise and strife, sternly with iron will Meting the threads of life coloured by good and ill, Woven of shade and shine and made Baneful and blessèd still. Lost in the splendid darkness extended, just and defended By the eternal Fate; There in the lustre of clouds that cluster, always they muster Lots at the golden gate. Tranquil and free from grief, drawing the ends of things Out of the rare relief blent with the bitter strings; Changeless they guide the mortal tide, Virtues and vanishings. On through our tangled web wrought by the troublous years, Touched not by flow or ebb, shifting in faiths and fears Secret and sure, wise and secure, Ever they portion tears. While the worlds slumber wrapt in their cumber clogging, they number Destinies grave on high; Terribly keeping watch on our creeping orbs, with unsleeping Gaze to which all is nigh. Dynasties come and go, systems may rise and set, Suns of a centuried glow sink into nothing yet; But they must live and not forgive, Nor at the last forget. Walled by devouring fire dim is the Great Gods' seat, Where they fulfil desire which we can nowise cheat; Shrouded and pale, they tell our tale In that august retreat. Grandly, with holy labours and slowly down on these lowly Duties, at ease they look; Barred from molesting pain and infesting evil, unresting, While they record the Book. With predetermined plan as cups drained to the lees, Hasteless they deal to man what he but vainly flees; For earth and sky, Necessity Falls from the impassive knees. MY FLOWER. Woven of air, a virgin thought, embodied as it came Fresh from the Maker's mind and wrought of phantasy and flame; A rift of blue, a message true Within a sky of gramary And ever still the same. The rapture of all sweetest things and gossamers and fairy wings, The grape's bewitching blood, The glamour which the sunset brings To bathe a mountain flood. The mystery of history from secret sluices drawn, A note of love and perfect rest made beautiful and manifest, A prophecy of dawn. The voice of silence and the scent of lands that none have seen, Borne over gulf and continent where holy steps have been— All gathered up in one fair cup, To gladden some great Queen. OVER MY GRAVE. The Spirit moved me and I spoke Of many thoughts and things, Just as its music in me woke And wafted ready wings. Great windows opened in my brain And let a Presence in, Which stirred to Beauty and its pain And was to all akin. I had no purpose of my own Except to do my part, And gather fruit which God had sown With sorrow in my heart. He softly breathed on me in song, And thence I faltered out Eternal hatred of the wrong, If dimly and by doubt. I was His lute, a humble chord Whereon He played at will, And only echoed back His Word Though jarred and jangled still. And all my worst and wildest airs, That murmured dark and low, Yet strove to climb the altar stairs Whence life and healing flow. And if I ever uttered right, Or sent one saving note To help a brother, His the might Which through my weakness wrote. And when I wandered from His seat Or found but cruel scars, It was my foolish wings that beat Against their prison bars. I would too often go my way And blundered from His tune, Which had I let the Master play Had turned all winter June. I sang of children and the poor In flickering swallow flight, And in the rudeness of the boor I showed a jewel bright. The mystery of Nature wrought On me, to syllable By bridges of my quarried thought The awful miracle. The humour at the heart of life Was often on my lip, Which peeped in laughter out of strife And curbed the cruel whip. I saw it growing out of grief Forbidding me be dull, While making tears their own relief, And grinning from the skull. Though still in every note I struck I knew a ruling Hand, And from its holding seemed to pluck The sweetness of the land. Till I was all respondent strings Whereon a Law was laid, Which marked the melody of things And babbled what it said. IN MY GRAVE. I lie among these holy hills Which nearer come to God, Bathed in the majesty that fills The world with wonderment and thrills Alike the sun and sod, In blowing wind and flowing wave, and beautifies the clod. The miracle and hush Of peaceful places and broad spaces, Here to their glory rush; Afar from sordid strife, I read in roots and upward shoots The mystery of life. I love the quiet of the dust, After the fevered fret And angry arms that fain would thrust Away my simple touch of trust And eyes with weeping wet— The eager aims and meagre acts are fancies I forget. It's always evening now, And to the glaring force and staring Deceit I need not bow; I only rest and dream, Care murmurs on as it has done Above me like a stream. The robin that we used to pet, Will sometimes come and sing As though it did remember yet Amid the snowdrops which are set About my bed in Spring— The throbbing throat and sobbing breath keep concert with its wing. I see its crimson breast, And here its calling with the falling Of daylight in the West; It almost seems a wrong, I do not live and cannot give An answer to the song. But now I have become so wise, Within my chamber dim Where secrets may no more surprise, I would not if I could arise To earth's mere outer rim Of fruitless lore and bootless love and idle vague surmise. For here I really know The sum and centre, and do enter The core of things below; For in the hidden womb Of miry clay dark pulses play— The birthplace is the tomb. If children come and chat and sit Among the bees and grass, I feel as though new sunbeams lit Upon them and my tale was writ In words that never pass— By burning thought and yearning deep more strong than stone and brass. My epitaph is truth, Set forth in simple faiths that dimple The rosy cheeks of youth; It's blessed to have been, When baby lips deny eclipse And keep my memory green. But thus I turn a boy again Who may not ever die, And do not at my lot complain, But in the very grave maintain A fresh and fairer tie With growing plants and glowing rays as here at rest I lie. I send my greetings up With shining showers and in the flowers, Daisy and buttercup; I learn all Nature's arts— How leaf and thorn are dumbly born, And live in loyal hearts. THE TRYST. In the sweet of the morning I rose To the trysting and went, And the violet from its repose Gave me greeting of scent; And the foxglove awoke from its dreams In the rivulet glassed, And though white blushed with alien beams As in passion I passed. All the birds tuned their silvery throats, And the throstle and dove Brushed the dew from their bosoms and coats At the meeting of love. TIME IS NOTHING. Sleep on! Sleep on! For time is nothing, And life a passing breath Which weaveth dawn and death In one for the Great Spirit's clothing, That moves and works beneath. The day is short and night is longer, And fate that gathers all is stronger Than shifting earth and sky; And we, the tools of hidden schools, Must do our destiny. O death! O life! Eternal strife! But which is death? And which is life? Dream on, dream on! The fact is vision And vision more than fact, The thought a larger act, And both the mocking of derision That plights with neither pact. The woe is jest, the jest is solemn, And ruin on the tallest column Hath set its chosen seal; The cares and joys alike are toys, For judgment to reveal. O life! O death! O flitting breath! But which is life? And which is death? Sleep on, sleep on! And to the morrow Bequeath the work to-day, And toiling tune with play; Nor meet in fear the phantom sorrow, Which melts in light away. The false is truth, and truth is fiction, And bane but one with benediction For wisdom of the years. And those that wait, through penance strait, Win laughter out of tears. O death! O life! O altar knife! But which is death? And which is life? Dream on, dream on! Our lot is little But substance of a dream, And equal gloom and gleam; The labour is a cheat, and brittle As bubbles on a stream. There's nought for either love or loathing, And treads the bier on the betrothing For future souls as past; The serious age is farce's page, And only follies last. O life! O death! O empty wreath! But which is life? And which is death? PHAROS. A shimmering point, a lonely light, In sunshine now and then in shade, Combing to cream the wash of night Which murmurs round its balustrade; The Pharos stands And lifteth up its beacon spark, It guides us as with guardian hands To haven through the homeless dark; It cannot sleep When others may securely rest, But must its watch eternal keep— Bright jewel of the ocean's breast. The hours in flakes of silence fall Out of the universal womb, Old Time, that (making, breaking all) Is still our birthplace and our tomb. They never touch That witness between earth and sky, Which suffers long and labours much But knows not our mortality. It giveth yet A testimony calm and clear, While suns and moons arise and set, Unchanging in the changing year! Fixed outpost of the world, it binds The land and water as its own, And troubled not by waves and winds Doth link the known to the unknown. It governs each, For though the ruler's arm be strong It may not at its farthest reach Like this, which rolls the earth along. In solemn care, With more than human love it gives To every clime an equal share, And for the peoples only lives. The Pharos in its glory beams A saving rock, a refuge still, Though strife in red and angry streams May thunder round its iron will. A house of light It holds within perpetual day, When winter and the hosts of night Besiege it hungry for the fray. Despite their shout, And through their shadows as they fly, I fancy God is gazing out Of it from hoar eternity. THE QUARRIED HEART. The generations yet unborn shall come, And quarry at his treaure houses; some To hang in tawdry frames some priceless gem, Or join it to a harlot's diadem Of borrowed beauty; some to turn their mud To palaces, that make the marble bud And laugh for ever in immortal lines. But, while he lived, men counted not his mines As rich with jewels and red gold; they passed To others, when they saw their features glassed In vulgar forms and squalid fancies. None Would know, that here a Master's work was done. They loved to find their own mean stupid parts Reflected by the same ignoble arts And glorified, and hail themselves all girt With native folly and congenial dirt Gilt. But this man would never soil his hand With touch of vileness, for a King's command Or ransom, and he went his royal way Unswerving if the whole world stept astray And left him stranded still. He held the truth, Who rendered it in dreams of deathless youth— And syllabled in song, till earth shall fly, Sole in his splendid wise insanity. But now, though he did with his beauty bless The poor and needy, and in lavishness Of regal robes made fine the naked form Which else had no defence against the storm; And scattered praises, like pure flowers of white, To lift the little to his infinite; Even now they call their own his riches, fain To steal that plenty which he wrung from pain; Till all the world is sweeter for his art, The quarried fragments of a broken heart. MAKING OF A WORLD. Somewhere in the great eternity Where no angel even had trod, From the womb of time's maternity And the death-throes of a God (Who alone by daily death Gives the universe its breath); Rocked by earthquakes and eclipse And all tempests at hand-grips, Swung the planet Out of night Into sight, Hazy, mazy, as if crazy Fear or drunken force began it. Fire and cloud, Shining shroud, Dim and dolorous and trembling Into order and new life, Forth from agonies of strife And strange energies assembling; Wan and ghostly thus it came Bodied flame, Fretting at the measured bounding Which compelled it now to bend To the predetermined end. So in dying which is living Every moment the dear God (Grown and realized by giving) As a woman might her gloves, Drops a planet To be someday gold and granite Full of burning hates and loves, Just to show the pathway trod And to prove Himself our God. MY LOST GARDEN. My pretty garden, Framed in the silence of the Chiltern Hills And hung as those for ever dead and gone In sun-bright Babylon, Discrowned by dearth, But then a glory betwixt Heaven and earth! With oaks like Arden, Whereon the silver cloud a season stills Its wayward flight and leaves at leisure The liquid treasure, Which by some magic process turns To precious gold The niggard mould, And fills with dews the empty urns. I hear it yet, Nor can forget The murmurous sound of ceaseless rain Which haunts the rustling poplar trees, Touched by no breath of earthly breeze As of a prisoned soul in pain; Which in the wondrous land of Long Ago I drank from open casement In pure and deep amazement, At night, from that soft lake of leaves below. The beeches glimmer, Far down the slope and up the happy height In gracious bounties Of tossing branch and tumbled spray That soar and sink and melt away Along a line of prospect dimmer And six fair counties, Into a solemn sea of misty light. Their virginal coy green Falls like a balm in blessed vision Of sweeter lands and other skies Upon the drought of old world-weary eyes Mocked by the years of vain derision, And fairies hide between. My gracious garden, In this dull barren city pent I mourn your Eden bowers And holy flowers For me unfallen, and without a spot Of evil, and I miss the pears that harden To ripeness rich and garment sober Of mellow scent, And change their colour with the chill October— I miss and mourn each little nook and plot. Soft lawn, Where daises struggled with the mosses Dew-sweet but alien, and in joy looked up And found fair sisters in the buttercup, To make the gardener crosses, In dim shy shades withdrawn! A stranger's foot now on your greensward stands Regardless of the love And gentle hands, Which ministered to all your daily needs And followed larger creeds Than those which simply saw the flowers above, But not the flowers below And beauty brighter yet within Which is to God Himself akin, And thence must overflow. Far outpost of the armies of the Hills, Thy wind-swept area For ever makes with many tones and trills A music in my breast, Which cannot rest; It holds the white stellaria Inside the glory of its ample girth, And brings to heavenly birth Beneath the shelter of the hazel copse And guardian oaktrees, which did erst environ The routed Stuart with their arms of iron, And pure snowdrops. A fragrance of old herbs and times Seems mingled with the battle chimes, Lost honour but not loves And ladies' gloves That were the colours of most gallant knights, And stolen blisses Of desperate kisses Snatched from the flame and agony of fights, In breathless pause Betwixt the rally And the sad final clause. The branching brake, And gnarled and twisted thorns On paths with fallen foliage crisper In fancy's wider Spring awake And nod their glamoured heads, and whisper Of deathless morns. Those graces twine Their tendrils round my inmost heart, And strike a deep and nobler chord Than earthly art; Until it seems a thing Divine, And like the Garden of the Lord. THE STATESMAN. I see him now, the statesman stand As some lone crag by lightning rent, With thunder voice and lifted hand Sole, sad, and eminent. From caverned eyes black beams of fire Shoot forth as arrows awful fate, And lava-like his heart's desire Is speech predestinate, He is his message, but the voice Which carries him and all his woes; Necessity, that has no choice, Shakes him with earthquake throes. No thought of wavering or a rest— He gives the simple mandate nude; Possessing and by this possest, In dreadful solitude. No weak misgiving now can bend His purpose, all unmoved by arts; He sees before him but one end— To break those stubborn hearts, Around him rolls an iron storm— The burning words that blast and strike The hardest life to light and form, Rain fast and hammer-like. THE PERSONAL EQUATION. What does God Almighty mean, Having made me And in shade me Fettered to a fortune low and lean, Now to do with such a creature little— Such a brittle Vessel, common and unclean? Yet He saith In His Word unto the ear of faith, Every jot and every tittle Of the Law shall be performed in season And declare its reason By the righteous predetermined end; So for me Somewhere must be, though in the far distance, Good excuse for this existence, And a goal to which I darkly tend As the rivers run toward the sea. Some day I, If I seem born out of due chronology, Shall by doing Deeds or wooing Danger, thus for being make a grand apology— Should I die. Thus you argue well and yarely, In the proper hole where squarely You are fitted; Who have never felt your own One disharmony, nor for a minute known What the iron meant Stabbed within the heart, still unacquitted Of a discord with its true environment. Nothing suits Me and mine, I seem apart, alone, Yet unable to atone For my barrenness in works and fruits. I'm not your quadratus homo— Nor could be, although I lived in fairy climes And enjoyed more large and liberal times; Sweetly in a paradise like Como, Totus teres et rotundus (Round peg in a ready round hole), If re-made and quite re-ground whole By the great mills, old, Divine, Which we often deem have shunn'd us; When (you say) they only watch and wait For the psychologic moment stern and strait, To reform us and refine. I am fifty, Fat and foolish, and have yet not found my task Sought for at the noonday and in murk Of the midnight, under every mask; I have been unthrifty With ball cartridge, too, and shot the Turk And the tiger In tall Indian jungles—Turk for choice; Sworn, with manly voice, In a dozen languages from Nile to Niger; Played the lover With the dusky houris of Pacific isles Dandled on hot bosoms to their sultry smiles; Hungered, thirsted, fought and fled, But could nowhere in my course discover Fitting post Made for me alone in camp or college; Though I stole my apples from the Tree of Knowledge And explored the living and the dead— Court and coast. Yes, I had my wildest fling and fun Everywhere, and with no 'prentice hand Tried the fashions of the sportsman's gun And full glasses, Or the measure of obliging rose-red lasses, Over all the world by sea and land; But I never By my utmost ripe endeavour Could, though asked of man and nation, Solve the sense of this d-d personal equation. What does God Almighty wish? He did surely not so frame me, Just to shame me In the eyes of all and my own self-respect; Like a fish Out of water, with no duty to expect And no purpose and no place? What can the poor Apteryx, that has no portion In the air and now is an abortion, Do to please himself or serve his Builder— Though he often gets a touch from some neat gilder, In this roar and headlong race? I want treatment sharp and thorough, As for a disfranchised rotten borough, Not mere trifling with a pinch of pain; But to be reduced to sections, And with all my follies and affections Clapt into the grand old cooking-pot again. Show me toil, Deal me pleasure, Brought for none but me to speed or spoil Of its virgin soul and treasure; I will do it and at any cost, Though it be with price of living Or by oceans and wild deserts crost And my heart's last drop of blood for giving. Ah, this is my honest crux— In the ceaseless ebb and flux Of our grim great tide of action Seething round me I have nought to do Which no other may, not a small fraction; Nay, not even to tie a harlot's pretty shoe. Worlds are making, Labours calling These to prisons, those to thrones— New stars rising, old stars falling; I can help none, not in breaking Wayside stones. I as something common and unclean, Seem omitted As the only one unfitted— What does God Almighty mean? HOEING. It is hoeing from the morning, It is hoeing till the night, With the burden and the scorning And the bondage of brute might. While the patch keeps growing longer But the weary arm no stronger, And the lashes they cut deep; Yes, and food is mean and scanty, And the clay bed in the shanty Kills the very thought of sleep. I am drudging at the row, In my dreams and always hoe. It is hoeing for a master, It is hoeing in the rough, At a toil that waxes faster And can never do enough. Every day it leaves me older, And red scars upon my shoulder Make a shabby dress for me; And the jewels I do carry Are the wounds, that if they harry Yet have left my spirit free. When I mumble down the row A dog's prayer, I still must hoe. It is hoeing on the level, It is hoeing o'er the steep, In the service of the Devil And with eyes that cannot weep. Ah, the bitter bread of toiling, And a life for ever spoiling In a labour that is hell; As the drear and darker morrow Brings but sadness to my sorrow, Like the tolling of a bell! If I fall across the row, I get up again to hoe. It is hoeing for no wages, It is hoeing through the years, And the printing of their pages Is baptised with blood and tears. I have seen my darlings sicken With the same, and then lie stricken In their furrow and their grave; And I could not raise a finger For their help, and limp and linger On without them yet a Slave. I am rotting in the row, And it's death that holds the hoe. IN HONOREM SENECTUTIS. To Beauty? No, I will not raise For such a heartsome song; Ah, that with cheap and ready praise, Has charmèd dupes so long. Nor will I seek a common truth, The gifts that dazzle us in youth Or blind our gaze to blots uncouth— No worship for the strong! For this has been the poets' way Since early Sirens caught their lay, And led the music far astray— To wreak a bitter wrong. For I see something more than art And beauty beyond grace, Which in eternal things has part, Even on the furrowed face; Above the glamoured hair of gold, Or eyes that with sweet magic hold— Yes, in the weakness of the old, I mark a heavenly trace. In every wrinkle or mute glance, The glory of a dead romance Or wreck of noble circumstance Doth print its dwelling-place. I love the silver locks, the seams Of grey and ghastly fright; Those faded eyes are full of dreams, And dance with living light. And under the bowed form, that ill Can totter down the easiest hill Though leaning on another, still Is strength of fairer sight. Beyond the features wan and worn, Gleams yet for larger purpose born The blushing of a brighter morn— For one who reads aright. Old songs and wine and ancient fanes, Undying statued stone, And not the trick of weather vanes Turned by a breeze's tone; Old masters and forgotten wit, And books no modern ever writ With lightning lines and infinite, A greatness calm and lone; I get me nowhere but in age Built in the bed-rock of each stage, An awful cosmic heritage— And here is Godhead's throne. FINAL FORM. I seek, I hardly know what thing— It's outlined in the eagle's wing, And trembles on a golden string With measures meted; I hear it in the cuckoo note, And ancient music with its mote Of suffering that some Master wrote— By none repeated; I see it in the iron cape Sea-washed that clouds for ever drape, And curve of maiden's magic shape Not yet completed. I seek, I hardly care to tell, What is the spirit or the spell That mortals know but none know well— The soul of graces; A touch that kindles the dead ash, A shadow on the long dark lash, A light of secret flowers that flash From sudden places; The miracle of perfect form Ruled by no earthly name or norm, The life in death, the statued storm— In women's faces. WHITE FIRE—SNOWDROP O firstling of the year Thou tender thing, Or flower or flame or an embodied tear— I know not which, sweet daughter of the Spring! But well am I assured That faultless grace, Hath in another form and life endured And looked upon the glory of God's face; To bring it back for us In perfume shed, With curve and colour finely softened thus And through a fitter shape interpreted. And we are better now, For only this— An insight which doth brighten each dark brow, And shows that nothing has been made amiss. We see and greatly guess, A human heart Shines out of heaven in thy pure loveliness, And man and God can never be apart. We gather precious lore To lighten toil, And lead us onward to the farther shore, When souls have washed them free from earthly soil. Thy blossom is white fire, A splendid spark Arrayed for us in sober dim attire, From the High Altars to illume our dark. But conscious of thy birth And blessed things, While fretting at thy meaner mortal girth, Thou hangest down that head with folded wings; To lift us higher up Than bounds below, To drink as of a sacramental cup The dews of heaven which from thee overflow. BURY ME. Bury me where you will, I care not now; But let me lie for ever lone and still, With nought but silence on my shadowed brow And that hushed heart which kept its solemn vow, Beneath the wind-swept hill. I ask no other mate, No different fate, But just to sleep and sleep in utter rest, Away from even the portion of the blest And all the world's wild circumstance and state, Upon the earth's cool breast. I played my little part Of lowly deeds; And still with love that laboured at its art, I fought my way through many cults and creeds And rivalries of base and noble deeds, To find enough my heart. No presence rude But solitude Shall henceforth be my comrade and my kin; While I slough off the lingering taint of sin, And face to face with God and Nature nude Learn truth and enter in. PAINTER AND PORTRAIT. I asked a maiden white to sit Just for her portrait and the pose, And that divine and darling rose Which ere the reddening loved to flit, And graces fine and infinite Which to my magic would unclose. Yet she refused—but soon relenting To my petitions with consenting Calm brow and softly swelling bust, Awoke a passion like dementing Within me; and the stormy sea Swept from my soul its higher plea, And only left a raging lust. On her I lavished all my art To make the picture meet for her, In curve and colour And that sweet dolour, That breathed in beauty from her heart Into her eyes of purple skies, And hair of golden gossamer. But, ah, the horror of the shape, Then on the guilty canvas thrown; A demon likeness would escape The glory there, and was my own. I burnt the portrait and my shame, I purged myself with prayers and tears And in the bitter night of fears Callèd unto the Holy Name; I set the canvas on its frame, And cried again to Him that hears. Once more she sat, with charms elusive And fragrance as of flowers diffusive, Which while I reverenced it went by As though it dreaded touch abusive; And in the heaven of holy joy, Crowned above earth and every toy She lived apart in purity. But when my spirit humbly knelt Unto the God of both, I drew No mortal features But some shy creature's Who in eternity had dwelt; Evasive gleams Of distant dreams, No longer spread their wings and flew. I fixed the fleeting gifts, and form Soiled by no sad or common cares In mid enchantment white and warm And caught an Angel unawares. BIRDS OF PASSAGE. I am passing through and on, Whither I can hardly say Though to some undreamed of Day, When this mortal light has laughed and gone; Souls are sinning, Loves beginning In the madness of our Babylon, As they sighed of old in gardens gay; Lives keep calling, In their falling, For the help of mine Eirenikon— And I never shall return this way. Let me kindly now I can As a pilgrim who must pass, With a mind unbound by class, Do what I may do for suffering man; Leave a little Work, though brittle, Which will enter in a larger plan— If it's merely one more blade of grass. Hearts that humbly Walk, still dumbly Faint beneath their grievous worldly ban— Earth is iron and the heavens are brass. I am only passing by, Here in plenty, there in lack, On a broad and beaten track From the womb of ancient mystery; Clouds enwreath me, And beneath me Lie the dead who dropt most ruefully And have paved the pathway with their wrack. But the living Ask for giving— Just a word may ope Infinity; And this road I never shall come back. While I pass among the throng Let me render what I must, Though amid the noise and dust— For the righting of a simple wrong. In the shaking Lands, is breaking Sunshine that will send the earth along And renew the glory of its trust. Lips, like mute strings, Yet God's lutestrings Add a note to the Eternal Song— They have fire, if yet the pauper's crust. WHITE HORSES. Where are the proud White Horses That pasture on the seas, And run their headlong courses At liberty and ease? They wander free and idle About their rolling lands, And scorn the bit and bridle Which carry my commands. I hear them in the distance, With flashing manes and wild; They reck not of resistance, Each tameless ocean child. At times they play or paddle Where sand and water meet, And dread no touch of saddle With light and frolic feet. I mark their shining shoulders Reared from the surges' rout, Whene'er my watchfire smoulders And evening stars step out. They heed not man or master, They revel in the foam And send it flying faster, As forth they fearless roam. He found the fair White Horses, When they were stabled deep Down in the crystal sources, And helpless in their sleep. He deemed that craft had won them, And vaulted on their back; He laid his spur upon them, To go his trivial track. But deftly though he mounted And dared abroad to ride, He had not fully counted As yet their dauntless pride. They bore him though a stranger, In safety for a while; They took from him the danger, The sooner to beguile. Then at their tempest gallop He learned a wiser lore, And broke his brittle shallop Against the iron shore. And widely on the waters They romped in sunny rays, Or grazed in quiet quarters On flowers of frothing ways. Where are the wild White Horses That mock at guiding reins, Nor heed our kindred forces, The empire in their veins? Why do they spurn the fetter, Which only speeds their flight, To pay God service better And give a vaster might? I know their glances wary, Their beauty bright and coy; The passion shy, and chary Of changes which are joy. I do not come to harry High necks with harder fate, I seek to woo and marry An equal honoured mate. How shall they live without me, Their destined love and lord, With thunder girt about me And lightning as a sword? I was ordained for ever With them to gather toll, And work by one endeavour To one determined goal. So man went forth in shadows, And man went forth in shine; He sought the great green meadows, The tumbling waves like wine. He saw the gay crests tossing Pure as a morning star, He heard the fleet hoofs crossing The ocean highways far. He emptied every coffer, He brought them gifts of price, And did not grudge to offer Himself as sacrifice. But then the proud ears listened Unto his humbler pleas, And then the wild eyes glistened Soft as their summer seas. They bowed for him the billow, They bended low their sides, And smoothed a royal pillow Above the smiling tides. They took from him the measure Which harnessed the salt surge, And bare him at his pleasure Before the breeze as scourge. Where are the strong White Horses, That carry now my spoil? They crave no more divorces, From common tasks and toil. I hear their fast feet thunder, Melodious on the lee; They plough the deeps asunder, In service fair and free. I tread their stirrups, soaring Above each path of pain, By pulse of patient oaring The monarch of the main. They paw the ground with gladness Whene'er they note my calls, They put off their own madness And pasture in my stalls. I love to see them champing The bit they never fear, The tumult of their stamping Is music to my ear. They stoop to lift my burdens Or some fresh braver band, And as their only guerdons They gently lick my hand. With moods no longer fretful And merry ways and mild, They turn no thoughts regretful To former wanderings wild. They chafe not at the chaining Which perfects their grand part, And thrills their whole stern straining The same imperial heart. The joy of world-wide labours Possesses them with pride, To make all kingdoms neighbours With me they glorious ride. Together do we furrow A passage over earth, And through grim sea walls burrow To better home and hearth. In safety thus I travel, Borne by the wingèd feet Which every realm unravel, As down my native street. No voyage now is idle, No venture can be lost; Until I slacken bridle, And the last sea is crost. NATURE UNVEILED. I looked at Nature, and her face was cold And almost stern and hard; As if she had some hidden truth to hold, And ever stood on guard. But then I moved away in doubt and fear, And like a timid child; Till in a moment she was more than near, And through her shadow smil'd. Ah, now it was no stranger that I saw Who dim and distant stood, Entrenched behind the inexorable law Above me darkly good. I saw myself, though fairer grander still, Stript of the earthly dress; And, under every human blot and ill, Diviner loveliness. For I was one with her in blessed power, And by her beauty clothed; The awful life, that thrilled the star and flower, Was unto me betrothed. And when I would in helplessness despond, Before the bounding ridge; The very limit was the life beyond, And the o'erpassing bridge. SECRET OF AN EGYPTIAN TOMB. Yes, nigh four thousand years ago Thou livedst, and those dark eyelids Which were as dew to dust below Looked out upon the Pyramids; And saw the lotus on the stream Which almost is the stream of time, Though but to us a winter dream And toy for this inclement clime. They marked the green papyrus wave Beneath the plumage of the palm, And all the glory now a grave Locked in its many-centuried calm; While Pharaohs, in their deathless pride, Stretched over half the earth their hands Of iron and blood, and turned the tide Which shaped the destinies of lands. And yet, though thou no longer gaze On miracles of storied stone, And temples poised in purple haze Which made eternity their throne; Thine unguents and thy colours fair, The passing triumph of a night That charmed thy cheeks and haloed hair, Still keep the magic of their might. UNDER THE GROUND. Under the ground six feet he lies! Ah, only now speak well of him And truth and kindness tell of him, Beneath the clods and guardian skies Watched by the gray Eternities. Calmly he rests and wisely keeps His counsel in its mystery, And holds from us the history Wrought by those old abysmal deeps— O long and fast our brother sleeps! Obediently he waits God's way Again to make a rover him, While little worms creep over him And in and out in merry play— An awful earthy holiday. We scooped him low a kindred nest, The dust claims fellow particles To build up fairer articles, And enters in the rose to rest Red upon some white maiden's breast. The friendly clay, the creeping things, Each at its work is dutiful, Each in its part is beautiful And treat him reverently as kings, With dark and solemn murmurings. Talk not in common clamour here, Where lies a man most tenderly Who brake the tie that slenderly Bound him to life and circuits sere— This is a holy atmosphere. He reads the riddle now of tears, The secret of sweet motherhood And our poor human brotherhood; He knows the hidden heart of fears, The inmost yearning of the years. And down among the primal roots He learns each ancient verity, And feeleth not temerity; He sees the shaping of the shoots, And why the midnight owlet hoots. The stones claim fellowship with him And whisper silent messsages, He hears and marks the presages Of language which to us is dim— The chant of veilèd Cherubim. Under the ground he lies in hope! He slumbers on quite pleasantly, And shall he not rise presently? His roof is heaven's dear purple cope, And all creations to him slope. “DOG'S EARS.” Here fell his hand. and for a moment trifled With the reluctant page, Objecting to be rifled Thus of its glory in the virgin stage Of new first freshness; by the strain and struggle, When rude young vigour tried to snuggle Too closely, madam, with its unwashed Adam, And the protesting page upcurled in rage. A boy's brown hand, Which fitted better to the bat or ball, And yet was beautiful in all, Shaped for command. Tall Harold! Now the earth upon him lies, And he has read the ancient mysteries Veiled from the mortal glances Of these lame deathward dances, And in the calm eternities He knows the secret of romances. Alas, that I, now shunted on the shelf With faded goods and hardihoods, Then did not go myself! And here—it is the same old story book With the same injured look, She toyed with baby fingers Most delicate and fair, But with a reverent awestruck air And timid touch that moved me much Almost to tears—and lingers; She tried to turn one stubborn leaf And got entangled in a sheaf, Then laughed and blushed in pink and white deliciousness At her poor awkward aims and baffled claims, And then had nearly cried In sheer capriciousness When she again and vainly tried. Bright Ethel! And she is likewise gone, who travelled far To sleep, no more a wayward child Though ever wild, Under the Southern Cross and alien star, And in no homely Bethel. But this? A dreadful combat here was hotly waged, Which ended in the usual kiss When sunk the storm that for five minutes raged And broke two tea cups and one golden head; Mab wanted pictures, Rob something to be read, And both had loving pats and strictures. But thus, you see, the shocking deed was done, And such a “dog's ear” (rather say a “hog's ear”) Was surely seen by none. Mab married— Well? A big house in Belgrave Square And half a million too, which with them carried A drunken bully and a world of care; She dressed divinely and was good At waltzing, pious acts and tracts, And early services and patent facts— Yes, everything but motherhood. Some artist fellow Who could when sober write And did (himself a dirty green and yellow) In “Black and White,” Made capital of her and took her off, in A season's tale, Which reeked of stale cigars and ale And ran through ten editions with the sale— But Mab was happiest in her coffin. Rob could not qualify for scarlet, And with one great mouth-filling d—n Swearing he would not be a lazy varlet Renounced the ordeal of exam; But then, born soldier, he— Yes, teste patre, sir, a game son— Went over sea To do his little share Of duty and a glorious care And rode and fought and died with Jameson. Look at this pucker! 'Twas here my parson boy, the placid Fred So fond of books he always jibbed at bed Like some Malay went suddenly a mucker; Because a visitor, One of the cousins whom he had by dozens, Called him a “baby”! Fred's fist soon turned inquisitor And one eye black and may be, The pretty pair— I can't remember now. His cooing voice and girlish hair And white unruffled brow, Took in his playmates till they felt His angry knuckles; His Bishop knows, if any Rector truckles To lord or layman, then his name is spelt With different letters. He is a book in trousers Unto this day, and it requires some rousers To tear him from his gilded fetters. One more! This is my Dolly's private mark, Pet and particular, Whose dainty fingers were not slack to score; She used to cuddle up to me at dark, With some auricular Confession of commandments chipped, When she had stolen sugar lumps or slipped On stony paths of virtue; With looks half-pleased, half-shy, As if I said, “No punishment shall hurt you!” With frocks and words awry, My precious Dolly! So exquisite, and wiser In all the riches of her radiant folly And pure defence of innocence, Than any miser With his tremendous balance at the bank And in his joyless soul a blank. It seemed not right that she should suffer, That fragile form of gossamer and dew And light be wrung with cruel pains Of many a throe and sounds of woe, And hear a sentence grim and gruffer Than torture's footfall cursed anew Or groans of prison chains; And lie for years of tears upon her back, As on a martyr's rack Or at a fiery stake to burn and quake In ceaseless pangs to lie, As she does yet With every pulse of agony beset— But not to die. And lo! I would you should consider next This turned-up text, The one reserved and ready show Meant for the infant of the cradle, A spectacle of most amazing art, With fearful hues of reds and blues And every colour too in part— Somebody feeding something with a ladle, And four and twenty blackbirds in a tart! Here golden Cicely, The baby romp then regnant Set her sweet rosebud lips, With mirth and mischief pregnant— Though all her sins were done so nicely— And took ecstatic sips With coral gums and greedy thumbs, Which left eclipse. Where is she now, I often weep and wonder? I question night and day The birds and breezes at their play, The flowers and thorns along my way, And thought and thunder; I ask myself, I beg of all, But nothing answers to my call. By many winsome naughty wiles And dazzling smiles To me and every one endeared, She sprang up as a splendid poppy Proud and despising shams and what was shoppy Or smelled of soil and honest toil— And disappeared. She left no single trace, A glance, a glove, a tiny thread of love, But in the boundless awful ocean Of life and strife without commotion Went down, and left an empty place In heart and home which never can be filled— Untamed, self-willed. Ah, death were fuel For an abiding sorrow and a shade Which could not fade, But this is worse and the most cruel Last mad refinement of all malice Which brims the chalice Above full measure with its flow— Never to know. One other rumpled Dear corner, and I then will cease. It is no common crease, Believe me, but is neatly wrought and rumpled By a fond mother's hand, Which here and there has left a pleasant sign Of ministries and care benign For ever yielding to some young demand Unsated; yes, the whole wide book Is blurred and blotted With her great tender love, which saw In each new whim's imperious law, Just the one task allotted. But at this tumbled page, I note a special stage And every wrinkle seems to twinkle With some sad heritage. O here There is a sacred scent, A solemn atmosphere Of things departed, Which dimly went out of our great content To leave me lone and broken-hearted. But at this very spot—I see her now Divinely bow, With not unconscious grace and queenly pose— Her elbow rested, As to my face she turned full-breasted And laid on mine her mouth's dear crimson rose; To tell me of her secret trouble, Hardly, at length, The gnawing curse which sapped her strength By silence long made double. And then she met the horror, fought Up to the citadel, As at his post a hero sentinel Unshaken stands and never flinches, Though deeply in her blood the poison wrought— And died by inches. You see, I find a sanctity and spell In this old picture-book so torn and tattered, And every “dog's ear” is a tomb Of hopes all shed and shattered. But yet, at times of evening chimes, It is a wondrous womb Of old and new creations and beginnings; And then my darlings do come back to me Bright without sear or sinnings, And falls another light on land and sea. POESY. Poesy justs sets to singing treasures that are free to all, With a common music ringing chimes in hovel and the hall; Letting loose the secret fancies buried by the heart of man, All the raptures and romances part of God's eternal plan; One for princes, or the peasant as he drudges at his toil Heedless the Divine is present though obscured by sin and soil. Yes, it takes the primal forces which below the human lie, And reveals those gracious sources never meant to droop or die; Thoughts and wishes like the fountains bubbling up through iron rock, Passions deep and strong as mountains and with more than earthquake shock; And the elemental feelings, kindred to the earth and sky, Fixed among the wrecks and reelings—this is gentle Poesy. Poesy to the wide nation and our individual needs Gives a clear articulation and out-syllables their creeds; And the vague unuttered yearning dimly felt and hardly known, Bodies forth in easy learning and makes lovely and its own. Tenderly it draws from nature miracles of secret might And unfolds the legislature writ on hieroglyphic night, Parables of woods that cherish awful spells and wayside lore And the love of waves that perish in their marriage with the shore. Till with breezes softly blowing, sights that broaden out the ken, Every silver bell is going down beneath in minds of men; While it gathers from the middle throb of things their mystery And the grave yields up its riddle—this is gentle Poesy. Poesy doth find expression for the dumb, and lends the blind Vision, and to even transgression is most beautiful and kind; And the silent sacred numbers of the dreams withheld from none But embalmed in centuried slumbers till interpreted by one, It calls out to golden waking of their old enchanted power, As if all the world were breaking into laughter and in flower And the burden of the ages under evil and the wrong Were a palimpsest of pages with an everlasting song. And what every soul, if kneeling or among the battle ring, Darkly guesses with the feeling, it alone can say or sing; When he comes who is the Master, and explains how tragedy Brings delight and not disaster—this is gentle Poesy. Poesy is glad and gaily steps along the dusty road, Light'ning our long tasks and daily duties of their bitter load; Showing the familiar lesson has a depth we never saw, While he puts a glorious dress on each imperfect art and flaw. Universal, with a healing touch as merciful as time, Lo, it falls in fair concealing on the ugly scars of of crime; And gray ruins blossom sweeter at the brightness of its tread, Shining out in shapes completer and yet living in the dead. To the magic of its splendour nothing may be poor or mean, And the vices we surrender it transmutes and turns them clean. Hope it seems in clouded morning, and at eve a memory Soft as bridal-sweet adorning—this is gentle Poesy. DOCTOR JOHNSON. Great Doctor, without thee this mighty land Were poor indeed, nor worthy of the fate Which built it up an archetypal State And clothed it with the thunder of command; To be a power no evil may withstand, And hold its freedom open as a gate. An army corps, an India unto thee, Girt with the terrors of thy lexicography And all the learning of our whole cosmography, Were little! For thou art a banyan tree; And to the shadow nations flock and rest, While on thy bounty feasting they are blest. Thy foibles too are grand and on one stalk Of wit and wisdom grow, and echoes yet The ocean music which none may forget; Though thy mere minnows cannot choose but talk As whales, and even thy very peasants walk Like kings with cares of empire sore beset. But if that vastness follows thee and makes The geese appear black swans and mole-hills mountains, Still deepest humour found in thee its fountains And with the laughter now our country shakes. Thy faults themselves were virtues, and the scars Stand out more sweet than others and their stars. The smallest trifle grew beneath thy touch Supreme, and got a brighter broader plan; The abject slave rose up and was a man, Remembering not that he was ever such; Thou gavest more, if thou didst gather much In that big orbit cosmopolitan. For with the compass of its dreadful dower Thy royal might dealt largely with each matter, The short waxed tall, the threadbare subject fatter, And barren minds from thee rushed into flower; The beggar had not time or need to ask, And liars heard thy roar and dropt their mask. Come to our Feast of Letters, worthy son Of this fair England! Take an honoured place, Second alone to Shakspeare's wider grace And many gifts! For thou art meet, and one With all our richest glory dared and done, And hast increased the splendour and the space. Now we may drink wine from the empty skull Of some hard publisher, who had his innings And sucked the brains of bards for golden winnings— Come, without thee 'tis incomplete and dull! And here are authors meek in maiden zone, With leisured Deans to give our table tone. THE GRAY MARE IS THE BETTER HORSE. It was during the discipline ordered by Lent, That they hunted the Thing called the fox Which is tied to a brush, on which all are intent Who are sportsmanlike and orthodox. And it looked like a penance for some, with a seat In the Parliament safer than this On the saddle, with chances they hardly could cheat, That inspired them with terrible bliss. For the joy on the face was a ghastly grimace, While at heart gnawed a dolorous care; But the first at the meet for the Master to greet, Was the girl on the little gray mare. With the groom a respectable stage in the rear, For propriety sake, and as smart As they make them, she felt but one generous fear— She herself might be late at the start. But the Master was waiting for her, with a smile And a bow only lavished on one; When she cantered up fresh, after clearing the stile, As no rider but she could have done. Then by twos and by threes through the meadows and trees, They came quick as their horses could fare; But the first and most fit and with merriest wit, Was the girl on the little gray mare. There was Leary the lawyer, and Jeston the judge With his hangings and sentiments free, And a Parson the rollicking Reverend Pudge Who could always find time for a spree— And with Dixon the Doctor came patients a score Who might ask for his services yet, And with fractions of foolishness live to deplore The bad steering that got them upset. There were ladies in pride who were able to ride, And were not—but quite willing to dare; But the first on the move and her cunning to prove, Was the girl on the little gray mare. There was Toady who stuck to his Peer like a leech, And the Earl who was horribly bored Though at times just a little explosive in speech— With strange words he had carefully stored. There were Squires and their farmers in pink and in black, Who had gathered to follow the fun; And of boys a fair muster and dead in the track, Who might rollick but would have the run. There was Blarney the Kelt who in Blarneyville dwelt, And of every good thing had a share; But the first of the flight, in her glory and light, Was the girl on the little gray mare. O the hounds made a music that Patti might blush At and own she was beaten at last, As they raced in full cry with the jubilant rush And the pace grew more reckless and fast. With their sterns mounting high and their muzzles that kept On the scent never losing the place, White and tan, grim as destiny, onward they sweep In the passion and joy of the chase. The queer jumps were not few and would puzzle a Jew, If not easy to stump or to scare; But first over the ditch, without halting or hitch, Was the girl on the little gray mare. Then the Doctor, in spite of his skill was at fault, Who found physic that led him a dance; And drew nearer by far to the family vault, Than he ever before had a chance. With the “thirdly and lastly” still fresh on his mind And the sermon for Sunday on hand, Then the Parson (wiped off on a bramble behind) Was bequeathed as a text to the land. And the lawyer, you see, got himself up a tree, With his precedents ready to spare; But the first at the fence, without brag or pretence, Was the girl on the little gray mare. The poor groom was not in it, and pounding with pain With his feelings decorously stirr'd Through a fallow, perceived his best efforts were vain— As his mistress flew on like a bird. And the farmers tailed off with their nags here and there When the hedges grew nasty and rough, And remembered their duties were urgent elsewhere— Though perhaps they had tasted enough. And the Toady thought beer was as good as his Peer, Meeting that and some uglier ware; But first over the rail, without fear, without fail, Was the girl on the little gray mare. But the Earl did not stay for a cropper or two, And went galloping pluckily on In the face of the worst, often blundering through, But more bright with his parasite gone. And the ladies save one, tailor-coated and all, Were discreetly conspicuous then In the distance, and saddened by many a fall Seemed discussing appearance and men. Though no trouble or need now could slacken the speed, And the Thing posted on like a hare; But the first at the front, as was ever her wont, Was the girl on the little gray mare. There was one on a thorn and another impaled On a bed of sweetbriars, and some Who had ruined their purse and the person regaled Themselves sorely on lectures to come; And the rider who mounted with gallant intent Was too often estranged from his horse, As if both had performed the unhappy descent And been through the dark gate of divorce. Many finding their bones were improved not by stones, Made a sight at which Bishops would stare; But the first, without harms, uneclipsed in her charms, Was the girl on the little gray mare. As they gained on the Brush, which was drooping at last, All the Squires except Blarney were blown; And the Thing called a fox could no longer go fast, While the hounds felt the victim their own. But a terrible brook lay between with a bank Of the stiffest and greasiest clay, And that broke for a minute the following rank As right through it they floundered their way. Here the Irishman dropt in the struggle and stopt, Just to pick up the pieces and sw——r; But the first one across, and with never a loss, Was the girl on the little gray mare. Then the Master, the Earl, and a casual whip Though quite out of repair and their breath, And with foundering steeds that were ready to slip, Yet were all somehow in at the death. And a boy not at Eton because of bad health Came up fresh and still asking for more, Who had taken his father's best nag out by stealth With a thirst for equestrian lore. And a cavalry swell who had something to tell, With a poacher caught in his own snare; But the first at the end, without rival or friend, Was the girl on the little gray mare. THE SIREN'S SONG. This is the song the Sirens sang:— “The oar Is but a burden, and the clouds that hang Are big with danger and the thunder roar; And here The restful bowers of golden flowers To lull your worn and weary powers, Perpetual evening atmosphere: The rose Invites you to the worlds of sleep, And dimly nods in red repose To pilgrims of the furrowed deep. “The seasons come, the seasons go, And sad are some as very woe For toilers on the dreary wave; But in our land of lazy streams, Where poppies stand in drowsy dreams, Is refuge for the ocean slave. The seasons go, the seasons come, And tempests blow despair to some With care and trouble unto all; Here zephyrs pipe from mountain top And fruits when ripe most gently drop, While lisping leaves to shelter call.” This is the song the Sirens sing;— “The sea Is salt and deadly, and the surges ring A knell of ruin to the sailor's plea; Here soft The shadows lie and breezes vie With waters and in music die, And blue are blessèd skies aloft; No pain Can enter our enchanted halls, But sufferers loose their iron chain And every load of sickness falls. “The sunbeams rise, the sunbeams set, And we are wise who do forget The labour of the earth and grief; And mellow light and shining showers With radiant night are sweetly ours, And sorrow is its own relief. The sunbeams set, the sunbeams rise, But do not fret us or surprise And only bring a tempered boon; For here are beds of yellow moss With scarlet threads that run across, And it is always the full moon.” LACRYMÆ RERUM. There is a touch of tears in mortal things, A note that cannot die, Which weds our failings as to angel wings By a most tender tie, And draws us nearer to the awful springs Which at God's footstool lie. It travails in the mystery of morn, And murmurs through the leaves; It is the point of every precious thorn, Which love with passion weaves; It wavers out of harvest beauty, born Among the golden sheaves. The accent of the rolling world is pain, And from joy's own excess; In hearts all broken from the blissful strain Of some Divine caress, Which passing into darkness rise again To the old utterness. Creation has one leaven and that is grief, Though taught in divers tones; From the great cry of an august belief, To sobs for loosened zones; But everywhere the sorrow is relief, And earth's foundation stones. I WALKED WITH SHAKSPEARE. I walked with Shakspeare, once, his kingly pace Consented to my own, and in his face I basked a season as beneath a sun Of glory, and I marked the fountains run That flow from him in fruitful love and life And water all the world with beauty rife. His calm clear eyes looked gently down on me, Big with those thoughts that make the nations free And brave and strong, and like a river swept His tidal speech in majesty and kept Communion with the currents of the earth And heaven alike, and fell in dew on dearth. I talked with Shakspeare for a while, and drank Deep of his wisdom as it played with rank And reputations and large modes of mind That shook and shaped their fortunes for mankind; He touched on all high policies of State As with the finger of unerring fate, And toyed with trifles and the fringe of facts Bodied by him in fine immortal acts. I heard and wondered and while near him felt Uplifted to the light wherein he dwelt Serene and sure with universal look, Who gathered sweetness from the star or brook And wove the leaf and portent in his plan, Which read the hidden heart of things and man; But, ah, I could not reach, howe'er he bent, The awful height of his great argument. THE SONGWRIGHT. Room for the Songwright setting the wrong right, Raise him a throne Grander than fiction, earth's benediction, Standing alone! Not the law-maker is the earth-shaker And real lord, With his dark vision's narrow decisions Fenced by the sword; Not the new argo richer in cargo Now than the old,— Corn and the scarlet vices and varlet Lives and red gold; Not in the gilded cage that is builded Up for the king, He who with tethers wears the gay feathers But cannot sing. Room for the greater true Legislator Crowned by no fear, Swaying affection, ruling reflection Hearts overhear! Down in his smithy forging the pithy Precepts of flame, Counsels of splendour though shy and tender As is love's name; There he is shaping bright the escaping Flashes of night, Humanly holding, craftily moulding Shadows to light. Lo, from the dimmer deeps comes a glimmer, Message of morn, Where by his giving leaps into living Thought like a thorn. Room for the master, more than disaster, Treading it low; Calm, with his fating finger, creating Glamour and glow! Daintily, under pageants and thunder, Pulling the strings; Momently making, momently breaking Countries and kings; See, beneath iron wheels that environ Matter and mind, Largely he measures earth and its treasures Ruling behind. Room for his regnant spirit and pregnant Music and art. Blest beyond faction, fruiting in action— Room in the heart! HISTORY OF A LIE. Dropt by rose-red lips in play, Just a word Told in idle jest that stirr'd Laughter, and then died away; Just a moment's mirth, a fleet Bubble on the stream of life, Low and little, soft and sweet, But the seed of lasting strife. Thus it came Forth into the world, and had Hardly substance of a name, But that it made gossip glad; With the sound Of light lisping, and the crisping Raised by silken frocks and satin Skirts that seemed to sigh in Latin With their dim susurrus dear, Born betwixt a smile and tear; Yet a Lie, Though so delicate and simple And begotten with a dimple, Owning not a sacred tie. Thus it went Up and down and to and fro, As an erring child might go If on nought but mischief bent. In the drawingroom and street Growing, growing, Flowing, flowing, Quick to scandalize and greet Every comer with its tale, Blowing, blowing, To the volume of a gale; With the patter Of the multitude of feet Hurried on at last to meet, With the chatter Of a thousand thousand rooks And a thousand thousand brooks All a-talking, all a-walking All together, Bound by the same common tether And by one desire to say What they should not and they would not, If they trod the truthful way. Till a trifle light as breath, By the progress of decay, Filled the country with its law And the awe As of universal death. IS THE WIND BLOWING? Is the wind blowing, brother? Then arise; For duty calls thee, not another, To work that no one may despise; And though thou wander far, a stray thing Tossed by each storm and still its plaything, Thou should'st not wish it otherwise. For black night cometh on Thee, as to Babylon It came and quenched that fair fruition, And left the Parthenon A pale tradition. Is the sun shining, brother? Then descend Into the battle smoke and smother, And with a worthy foe contend; Wilt thou not strike when swords are ringing One gallant blow for honour's bringing, Ere thou at well-earned feasts unbend? Ah, this bright beaconing day Will go its weary way At last, if now so bold and pleasant, And ashes cold and gray Lie on the present. Is the tide flowing, brother? Then thy bark Is hailed by it, and not another; And thou must voyage forth, if dark Or doubtful seem the dangerous journey And big with many a toil and tourney— God is a pilgrim in thy ark; Till evensong doth call, And grim as grave-clothes fall Alike on mountain and green meadow, What is the doom of all, The final shadow. Is the land waiting, brother? Then no rest Is here for thee; earth is thy mother; And thou must bruise her bosom, prest With early ploughing and late sowing, To woo the life that now is growing And bubbling in her fruitful breast. Thus of thy goodly corn The children yet unborn Shall eat with comfort in their blindness, And drink (no more forlorn) Thy milk of kindness. BLOOD AND MILK. God at His world-loom laboured a-spinning, God in His lonely light, Making the human's blessed beginning Woven to one delight; Thought was the flesh, and bone out of action Grew from a core of kindly attraction Shaping the mighty soul, Garbed with the will of broad benefaction Unto a perfect whole. Nothing unclean He fashioned or common, Forth from the deeps Divine; Blood of the man and milk of the woman, Parted but to entwine. Thus was the start of earthly salvation, Framing a giant force Fed by the life of larger creation Finding in Heaven its source. This is the secret taught by the sages Written in peace and bloodier pages, Lying beneath them all; Down through the stream of historied stages, Parent of faith and fall; Glove of the iron firm as the mountains, Glove of the softest silk— Blood of the man, and nourishing fountains Warmth of the woman's milk. Now as the earth in sunshine and shadow Rolls its predestined way, Glow of the hilltop, grace of the meadow Wax with their wondrous play. These give to lives their true and appointed Paths, amid clash and clang of disjointed Times in the troublous years; Crowning them kings and queens, if anointed Only with cruel tears. These bid the world grow happy and human, Sloughing its care and crime; Blood of the man and milk of the woman, Watering every clime. Thence is the progress though by division, Thence is the central love Joining our sexes to a decision Settled in courts above. So for all seasons unto each ending, Which is but groundwork for a new tending Unto a fairer turn, Riseth the rapture breaking and blending Hearts that for union burn. So shall the unseen drawing deliver Souls to their final rest— Blood of the man that runs like a river, Milk of the woman's breast. BROWN BIRD. Brown Bird, Or shall I call thee Winged Word? What awful unimaginable trust Doth cast thee on our Father's breast, Singing and rapt, a storm at rest, While we keep clinging to our earthly dust? As in blue motion The very sky hath from thy wing Caught its divinest murmuring, And thy devotion; It seems to ripple on in circles sweet, Until it washes God's own blessed Feet. Bright Bird, Thou hast for ever fondly stirr'd The inmost heart of every loving man, And struck a universal note Which even no greater teacher wrote, And broadened bosoms and our cosmic plan. In living layers, Builded by thee a temple white Goes up and scales the Infinite, With happy prayers; As though we heard the happy angels sing, And Heaven itself were all beneath Thy wing. God's Bird, Or dare I say His final Word? In joy that chases joy along the sky I listen to the liquid thrush And nightingale's delirious rush, But thou hast tones of true Divinity. Now Heaven is nigher And blotteth out the gulf of doom,— Continued earth, or the next room And only higher; For with the bridge of worship, by thee trod, Thou hast remarried man once more to God. IN A WOOD. The kindly trees stooped down their heads And curtseyed as I walked, While gentle flowers on fragrant beds Spirit to spirit talked. The boughs put forth their friendly arms And music round me made, To wrap me in their homely charms And hospitable shade. Until my sense of space was gone, And earth appeared to fly, And all my breast was cradled on The bosom of green sky. I heard the humming of the springs And axles of the globe, The solemn march and murmurings Beneath the swelling robe. And tingling to each tiny point, The pulse of living Law Armed every vein and mystic joint With dear delicious awe. And in the shadow of a dream I softly seemed to float, Adown the shadow of a stream Within an emerald boat. THE CATHOLIC. No one nation, No one time, Compasses his glorious vision Which embraces every clime In the purpose of its plan; Builded on the sole foundation Meet for universal man, Bridging earth and scaling sky In divine and calm derision Of our poor mortality, Lo, he fights not for the fraction Of a faith, Or the colour of the stole Won by some small dying fraction And the wraith Of a long departed creed; Nothing less, Can content him, than the Whole And Eternal Loveliness In accord with every need. Down the ages Runs his thought like golden thread, With a pulse of fiery leaven Kindling all our blotted pages And old stories dim and dead, With the life and light of Heaven; Till each broken prayer and part, Find an echo in God's heart! THE PROTESTANT. Erring often, Always thorough With a moral and a mode Which no time or turn will soften; As if wisdom were his code And no other's, and his plan Just the only way for man, And all heaven his rotten borough. Yes, he blunders Terribly, and tires his friends With the old familiar ends Which we know alas! too well, And the little throes and thunders Dooming half the world to hell. Yet he does believe, as few, Still in something and a God Though for ever with a rod To reduce us to his level, And indeed more like the devil Whom we rather would eschew. But despite his petty range, He has marrow With the rant, Bone and muscle in his strange Medley of ill-mated lore From an unhistoric store; There's a jewel, in the narrow Protestant. TO MY ALMA MATER. Towns rise and fall, fair systems come and go, All things obey the rhythmic ebb and flow Decreed by nature, and fulfil their stature And pass or into alien uses grow; Philosophies have died, and stately creeds Did fade for others as their living seeds, And dust of nations wrought the new foundations Of present powers and serve our riper needs; Gray speculations from their centuried grave Have yet returned in triumph, and to save A time or city in immortal pity From freezing error and its winter wave. But thou, my Alma Mater, shinest yet Though lesser lights have round thee flashed and set In the dumb starkness of eternal darkness, To be a name which scholars even forget: Thou art a piece of England and the years Which builded us of splendid faiths and fears, When kingdoms tumbled and religions crumbled, And mighty singers married fire and tears; As through the periods paced by famous feet Still windeth on, where wit and wisdom meet, By court and college and the shrines of knowledge The ancient river of thy storied street. Kings were thy sponsors, and the great and good Loved thee and in thy pleasant cloisters stood, Or fenced the straying land in walls of praying, And with all beauty thou hast brotherhood; Here learning laid the bases of its throne, And hence about the earth the radiant zone Of thought has travelled and deep lore unravelled, To prove thereby some Master's touch and tone; O thou above the vulgar crowd and cries Hast had blue glimpses of serener skies, And with thy martyrs given the world its charters Of blessèd hopes and broader liberties. My Alma Mater, pillar of the State And one with it in grandeur and in fate, For ever loyal to things right and royal, Unmoved by sworded din or high debate; A nursing mother to brave spirits tost On doubts like ocean, while to causes lost As classic Cato steadfast, and with Plato Bridging the gulfs which none but he has crost; Not often lured by falsehood's golden wraith To heed what treason though empalaced saith, 'Mid old traditions finding sweet fruitions And in the night a fortress of the faith. Green spread thy gardens as a lingering page Of eld, and each stone is a drama stage, And on the hoary towers abide in glory The latest sorceries of a larger age; Long generations formed those lawns and leas— At length—so glad to educated ease, Nor rest there shadows upon other meadows With haunting memories such as thine to please; Most venerable thou, yet always young With some quaint fancy trembling on thy tongue, And in the dewing of fresh founts renewing Those graces which no bard has ever sung. Thou shalt not pass when meaner homes have fled, If fanes and fabrics like the rose do shed Their life in fragrance soft as visions' vagrance, Buttressed in truth, by praises ramparted; Of worship are thy bulwarks, and the sod Is redolent of pieties, where trod The haloed teachers and the heaven-sent preachers, And all thy reverend cults have root in God; Still be our beacon when the land is blind And make our men not only kin but kind, While in thy oratories and thy great laboratories Thou addest empires yet to unmapt mind. BURNS. Scotland's heart of burning fire, Moved by every wind and weather, Gold of gorse and purple heather, All delight and all desire! Blending with the bliss of song Taught by the ascending lark, Hatred of our ills and wrong Done to brothers in the dark; Thine the human touch for good, Thine the tender wit that mellows Bitter strife and makes us fellows, In one holy brotherhood. Nothing little was or mean To the vastness of thy vision, And before thy love's decision Nothing common and unclean; Thou didst gather from the plough, Painted butterfly and bee, Moorside bracken, fruiting bough, Something of the great and free; Minds of men and laughing brooks, Birds and white rose maidens' magic, What was true and what was tragic, Were alike to thee but books. Even the mouse that pattered by Gave thy tune its homely flavour, And the humblest weed found favour With thy own mortality; Surly sods that unto toil Opened out their yellow heart, Poured the passion of the soil And its perfume in thine art; While the thunder of the gale Salted by each Frith and forland, Blew thee from its iron nor'land Madder music for thy tale. Daisies with their dewdrops wet, Breath of lute and lowing cattle Driven to homesteads and red battle, Murmured in thy song and met; Thou didst gild the cottage cup And by hedgerows pause to pray, And the peasant proud stood up Knighted by thy lordly lay. Stretching dimly to the morn Hopeful hands, yet thou art bringing Presents for all time and singing With thy breast against the thorn. THE GOLDEN AGE. See down the broadening years, See through transforming fears Greater the light appears, Grander the glory; Dawn of a brighter day, Dawn of a better way, With all the world at play— God's new love-story. Larger the minds of men, Fairer the women then, Vaster the creed and ken In a true living; Gold in the wealthier books, Gospels in children's looks, Swords turned to pruning-hooks, Earth one thanksgiving. Others shall see those times, Others shall hears the chimes Wedding peals in all climes Of the free nations; Mine be alone the trust, By gentle word or just Deed to enrich the dust Of the foundations. I can help kneeling now, I can uplift a vow Unto the Heaven and bow In some dim corner; I can achieve a part, Whence nobler work may start, If but the broken heart Of a spent mourner. Others may tread me down, Others may wear the crown Of undeserved renown, When I am ashes; Never a tear for me, In happier homes to be When every land is free, Dropt by dark lashes. Give me the martyrs' thrones, If yet my crumbling bones Serve as the stepping-stones For wider stages; Let me be only dross, And over my dead loss Shall ransomed peoples cross To the crowned ages. SECTION V. Brake and Brier. DE MINIMIS CURAT DEUS. You say—“I am nobody, nought, a thing That can never tell in the total count When the Creditor sums the grand amount, Any more than a straw or bonnet string; I am little and ugly and mean and fat, With a face that has not one curve of comeliness And a general look of squalid homeliness— Not a touch of the true soft sweet Divinity To redeem a life that is false and flat, But the barren charm of a cheap virginity.” And you add, “I would rather be a buckle Or the crumpled tag of a creased rosette On the harlot shoe of the fair Babette, And have bastard sons at my breast to suckle (Just the little accidents by the way) With a score of gilded lovers gay And a fuller past, and a bodice rounding With the milk of joy and a lot abounding; I would chance the priest and his musty morals, And the prudes and their infant bells and corals, Or risk the wrath of an outraged Deity In a possible Heaven of impossible capers Like a vestry lit with its prim wax tapers, To be myself in all spontaneity.” And you murmur—“I loathe the stays and starch, The pitiful whole and wretched portion Of a birth like mine, a mere abortion; That must creep and crawl on the millround march Of an unknown nameless and empty toiling, And sneak and snivel for fear of soiling The proper dress with improper attitudes Or the tiniest trick of a semblance prurient, And be choked with the husks and paltry platitudes When the soul rebels in a rage esurient; While the rich, the beautiful, and the luckier May kick up their heels in a bean-fed coltishness In the stews and palace brothels muckier, And from every trammel of every code Break free (if they sacrifice to the mode) And rejoice in a wanton wild revoltishness.” But you think—“The measures are not the same For the poor and the wealthy, the plain and pretty; And the form that is like imprisoned flame With its ardent eyes and the lashes jetty, May sin and repent and souse in the gutter And emerge once more to the sheet and candle With a cultured lisp and a dainty stutter, For another bath in another scandal; “Though I,” you moan, “may not taste a particle Of the sweets forbidden to pauper stuff And the yard-round waist and the doubtful cuff, On the features without a bit of devil And ruled to one dreary common level, But must keep the law in its lightest article; And life like this is not worth living In its sordid ruts and the sober chances And want of skittish nude skirt-dances, When the legs at least are among wild oats And may show with assurance of forgiving Their womanly shape under petticoats. And to put aside the mere pomps and vanities,” You argue, “and social names and nods And fashion's fooling and golden gods Or the becks and bows of padded popinjays, Like the dummies in town—if you only shop in Jay's, I know nothing yet of the real humanities. No, I have not truly lived a second, Though I ate and drank and secreted matter And excreted waste and grew out and fatter, As a cabbage does in its garden row Unseen in the vulgar shade below— But life is by other standards reckoned.” You conclude—“I would rather walk in the street And drink of the darkness and the sweet, Than live in the light and get salvation By a process of nought but vegetation; For I long to indulge my fling and fill, Whatever the priest may brag and bellow Who has grown with vice prematurely yellow Though he now denies the smallest latitude, Of the lusts for which I would gladly grill In a brimstone fire and give up Beatitude. I have never felt my pulses beat In the madness of unlawful blisses, With the rapture and the stolen kisses When the blood was full at its fever heat; I have never throbbed with the thrill of Nature, Or yielded the palpitating flesh To the lips that stamped their legislature On the conquered mouth that asked afresh; I have never loosed, what they want to hide in us By the figleaf texts of a narrow quorum And a starved and straightlaced dead decorum, The wild free breath of the power libidinous. I would rather be a depowdered trull, Than the saint with the rouge inside her skull.” I know—you are wrong in your facts and fancies, And the gold-dust on the butterfly's wing Has a place and part in the splendid whole; As well as the sceptre of a king, Or the presbyter decked in his painted stole— And Truth is more than your gilt romances. Not a useless thing, not a cypher rivet In the grinding wheels of the grand machinery, Not an idle spray in the hedge of privet That is splashed about your home in greenery; Not a speck of rust on the two-penny pannikin That cooks the broth of the freeborn gipsy, Not a stain of dirt on the booted mannikin In the sleek of his sober groove or tipsy; But each is an item with its weight, And helps to the balance of all freight. For you have a settled office if I can't And not to be spared, in your quiet nook No less than the sages with vast outlook, And the veriest trifle is significant. Why, if the least little screw or cog In the awful sweep of the wide world's jog As it grumbles round, were to get awry And be lost in the cosmic swirl and sway, Or but for a moment went astray, It would unseat God in Eternity. There is not a superfluous mite nor may be In the supreme synthesis of totality, And the molecule and the mightiest mount Have each a place in the last account, And every hair of the newborn baby Must be reckoned too in the fair finality. For each, if deducted, would be missed By something or some one and by God Who has never an atom more or less Than He wants, and leaves not a mouth unkissed Nor a pea without its enswathing pod, In the width of His guardian watchfulness. And were you away from the pensive corner Where you sit and mope an unmated mourner, Then the Universe would be so much lacking And worse for the silent chord—you give In your measure strength and beauty's backing And proportion, whereby the Sum may live. In the grand orchestra, absent Nicolo Creates a blank, though it's but the piccolo. I know—that our earth is sick with trouble, And the poor and weak bear more than double Because they are such, and the evil rises Secure and crowned and above the curse— If it only keeps the keys and purse; But I will not own, that it has the prizes. For to suffer is the highest blessing And a fate Divine, that we drop with peril To the soul thus left to a struggling sterile— It is good, and the Father's fond caressing. To be let alone is an Ephraim lot, While you fool and flourish and heed no issue And riot at ease in the pleasant places With flattering lips and false embraces, Regardless all of the canker spot And gather more of the adipose tissue. To romp in a round of elegant dresses And a whirl of the sweetest eyes and hair That to riches are always bright and fair, While you ride on the flood tide of successes; If you rake in the gold and never fail To glut the passions howe'er importunate, And lack the point of a single nail Of a single care—you are the unfortunate. If you hold your gun or stick to the station Though it be but a barnacle's inch of rest, And fulfil the end of your own creation— By scrubbing a floor or washing a platter, Or growing a grass blade out of a clod, And planting a pulse of mind in matter— You are dutiful, wise, and doing your best And one with the inmost Heart of God. For he aids, if but by the merest decimal, Who falls in line with the marching orders And steps to the tune by the piper played, Whether all in rags or with silk arrayed, But inside the fence of his nature's borders— And we need both great and infinitesimal. O the humblest beat of the human love, Not a ripple upon the tidal river Which rolls the earth on its wondrous way, Has yet its mark and immortal ray; It flings, to the Central Source above And the uttermost orb, a vital quiver. Would you be a discord or rusty screw, In the onward journey to ripe perfection Which is building the House of God anew? Shall the dust rebel at its resurrection? BLOW THE TRUMP IN ZION. “Blow the trump in Zion”— That's my goodly name— When the foe is raging, lusty as a lion, And retreats in shadow and lies down in shame; Sounding late and early In the early-burly Of the Holy Gospel and the glorious fight Towards a precious haven and a purer light, Praise the Lord with singing, Praise Him with the sword; When hard blows are taken or soft bells keep ringing, Always give Him honour, only praise the Lord. “Blow the trump,” to battle— That's my office true— When the blades are striking and the bullets rattle On the buckler, and the devil gets his due; Sounding on and ever With a high endeavour, Till the reeling squadrons where the pennons toss In mid act of breaking rally round the Cross. Pray aloud, my brother, In the smoke and smother, While the end looks doubtful in the night of fears— Pray with blood and iron, pray to Him who hears. “Blow the trump” with shouting, For the Blessed Book; March a solid wall as one man to the routing Of the sinners, sunk in flesh, whereto they look; Sounding as it's written, While the foe is smitten As with Samson's jawbone fiercely hip and thigh With a noise of thunder, when the Lord draws nigh. Praise the Lord with fasting, Praise Him at the board; In the silence and with homage everlasting Always do him reverence, only praise the Lord. “Blow the trump,” and wrestle With the Powers of Gloom; Spare not dainty damsels, nor the babes that nestle Idly at their mothers' breasts against the Doom; Sounding to the struggle, Ere the idols juggle With poor souls that lean upon a painted lie, And unless we taught them would in darkness die. Cry, ye fellow sinners, Humbly and yet more; For the Captain cometh, who will lead the winners, As the wind that blows a billow to the shore. Blow the trump,” with blazes Of devouring fire, Through the labyrinthine errors and wild mazes In the Land of Belial and its lewd attire; Sounding truths of gladness In the mirth and madness Heard among the gardens, where sweet fountains flow And the Trees of Pleasure beautifully grow; Where the Scarlet Woman By her evil ken Stands with sops of worldliness a deadly foeman, Tempting looks of weakness, trapping lives of men. “Blow the trump,” and scatter, Armies like the chaff, That the saints upon their treasures may get fatter With the lamp of knowledge and the steel for staff; Sounding forth and gaily Blasts of precepts daily And the promises of bliss for the Elect, Which transgressors at their peril do reject. Praise the Lord with little, What ye can afford, Praise the Lord with plenty—hostile bones are brittle— Always praise Him freely, only praise the Lord. “Blow the trump,” and follow Whither leads the way, Proving hopes of rebels yet are vain and hollow In their riot while they never watch or pray; Sounding with the morning Gospel news and warning Notes of full salvation till the end and night, Yet baptizing sinners in red sweat of fight. Bid them rise and waken With the point behind, From the bonds of Egypt's flesh-pots rudely shaken To a higher purpose and a surer mind. “Blow-the-trump-in-Zion”— That's my solemn task— If false gods have service which their dupes rely on, Till we beat them low and tear away the mask; Sounding peals that double Sin's despair and trouble, When the Lord descends with pomp of judgment right And the Laughter of the Lord is known in might. Soon will come the reaping, Falsehood's day is short; When the few have crossed the river's roar and leaping, They shall anchor safely in the Heavenly Port. MY GRANDFATHER. This was his private chair, It looked a throne, Wherefrom he spake of all things fine and fair And ruled alone. We loved, who knew, him and his merits much And fondly hung on every tone or touch, That seemed to open the most awful bar With sense oracular And inward sight; A sudden leap as into God's own Light, Which unveiled other earth and other skies And solemn mysteries. His graceless grandson, I Yet bowed to him, And struggled vainly towards that station high With purpose dim. He was so patient with my wilful ways And at the darkest dropt some kindly rays Upon their tumult, till the great Heaven drew Down to my humble view; And God's white rose Poured in me rapture of a strange repose, Which summed the passion of all moments pure That lived and yet endure. Oh, in another land He calmly dwelt, And the mere waving of that dear old hand Was kindly felt By each, and with an eloquence unsaid Talked to me when I erred and was afraid; I knew he cared for all, and gathered me Within the unbounded sea Of his grand love, And would have lifted me with him above; Though then I walked in darkness, and my day Seemed far and far away. This was his Bible, yet For study set; But not, alas! by him, who from that source Mapt out our course, And stept the first and with undoubtful voice Declared God's Will and lived the larger choice. It's like a book of travels, which he went From isle to continent, And charted too With his own marks and measures through and through; And thus I keep my bearings, and the road No longer is a load. LALOO. With his trousers turned up and his nose in the air And an amorous eye for the fond and the fair, He was humming a song As he drifted along To the Devil, to whom better people repair. By the shops and their glamour He had idled his way, Hardly heeding the clamour And deaf to delay; He had little to lose and no portion to choose But a beggar's and need, And no brother was nigh who could wish him God speed. Who are you, who are you, O my pretty Laloo, Of the cheeks so bepainted, With an odour of musk And the passion for dusk, Like some angel unsainted? Is it true, is it true, My dear naughty Laloo, With the blushes you borrow, That no priest gave that name And your bread is but shame In the sweetness of sorrow? But she flew to his whistle and asked for no word Though with plumage all ruffled and soiled as a bird, When it catches like fate The clear note of a mate, And the one chord within that lone bosom is stirred. She was winsome and willing And had waited for this, Just to share her last shilling With a curse and a kiss; While her beer-sodden breath came betwixt him and death In a suicide's grave, And she loved for a week to be only his slave. It is blue, it is blue, O my happy Laloo, In the sky that was scornful; And those eyes that were wet Any night may forget, That they ever were mournful. Sad ado, sad ado, Poor improper Laloo, Would be raised in the churches; If they heard, that this link Was cemented with drink, As beside them he lurches. But they wanted recruities, and he had the will Yet to fight for the country which paid him so ill, And had flouted his toil On its niggardly soil, And might starve his weak body and then could not kill. So he listed one morning When subdued, as his wont, And in martial adorning Hurried off to the front. If his officer led, over heaps of the dead He would follow at heel— Licked to shape by rude buffets, and stiffened to steel. Here's to you, here's to you, O devoted Laloo; For you sold every jewel Or pawned half your clothes, And with tears covered oaths— Though the parting was cruel. Let him woo, let him woo, My unselfish Laloo, Some black maid with your money; If he faces the fight And his courage is right, He may taste other honey. For the Tsar had preached peace and the nations felt fear, And they knew that the horror of battle was near; Time found Tommy a man, When the business began And the bullets were flying and sabre met spear. In the red dew that drenches The young hero it makes, He lay down in the trenches From which none awakes; But in beauty and rest on his glorious breast Hid some blood-dabbled hair, Which once brightened the brow of the fond and the fair. You will rue, you will rue, O forgotten Laloo, The gay lad who was started With your purse and brave cheer On his gallant career, And left you broken-hearted. But now who, but now who, My improper Laloo, Will be next at your spoiling? Though the soldier sleeps best Whom your charity drest, Where old Egypt lies broiling. THE DEAD MARCH OF THE LIVING. We are marching, we are marching Under heavens all overarching But all pitiless and dumb, In the winter cold and numb And in summer pinched and parching; Though the sparrow gets its crumb, With a little drop of water And a kind and cosy quarter From the frost; While we are tost By the stony hearted street To and fro In want and woe, With the tramp of countless feet. And we stay not, For we may not Loiter upon Eden's borders, Though the weakly Ones fall meekly Down and still beneath us lie; For we have our marching orders Marching though we drop and die, Marching on Though health is gone And the early light that shone Sweetly for the opening page Of our early pilgrimage— Though the pleasure in our toil (When we started) Which is only sin and soil For the brow And bosom now, Has departed. Marching on Though friends are gone, And our eyes can hardly con Still the lesson we must learn, While our hands do rarely earn Just the pittance, That is quittance For the shadow that with blight Enters not the rich man's door, Darkens not the marble floor, And at last is all our light. Marching on, If hope is gone In the rags we scarce may don With our tired and trembling fingers, And the feeble fluttering breath— Woe to him who turns or lingers, When to lag behind is death! Marching on And marching on Through the devil's Babylon, Marching hence and marching hither, But alas! we know not whither, Up and down And to and fro In the many-palaced Town Which on us does only frown, Weary dreary must we go Without pity, without rest, Homeless, sleepless, and unblest; With no bread Except the stone, With no bed But earth alone. Ah, if we indeed might stop For a space In some soft place And learn some of Nature's grace (Not in gutter or the shop) In the sunshine, though we dim it With our squalor, that may drop— But, save death, can find no limit! Dives with his gold and starch, With his linen clean and fine And his wine Wetting lips that never parch, With his pampered hounds and kine Rests and revels while we march Under heavens that overarch All with equal shade and shine. Flung like flotsam of the wave On the shore Which denies it of the store That might save, And repels it as before To the grave— Yes, to the grave. We are marching, marching on, Hope and health and living gone— If we live, Though we are dead And our bodies only tread Now the streets that grudge us bread, And can nought but curses give; We are ghosts and fugitive, Ghosts of women, ghosts of men, Ghosts of children—dead and gone, From the jail and sweater's den, From the paupers' cattle-pen, Marching on And marching on Through this heartless Babylon; Dwarfed and stunted, Hooted, hunted By the State that feasts its robbers And its jobbers, While it starves us Down and carves us With the scalpel of its scorn, And protection Not affection— Wretches that were best unborn, In our helplessness forlorn. We are marching, while we can, As we may, The child and man On the same old weary way In one ragged disarray, With no plan But a brief and ghostly span, As the ghosts of yesterday, Just to keep still marching on, (Where the hopes of childhood ran And the lights of childhood shone), Marching on And marching on. Outcasts in great Babylon. BRIDE OF DEATH. Tall and fair As the Bride of Death She stood in the stony-hearted street, Though the wind was rough with her golden hair And the pavement rude to her tender feet, With a sob that caught at her troubled breath; Late and lone, With her virgin zone— She had only left that one dear jewel, Like the light of Heaven around her shed, If the world was hard and her hunger cruel;— Should she give of her beauty now for bread? Pure as gold, Though her fate was such, She fought with the lion in his lair And the mocking kindness grim and cold; But alas! for the crime that she was fair, With her conquering grace's final touch! Frail and white With an infinite Force that sprang from a splendid nature And illumed her eyes and crowned her head, She arose to a height of godlike stature— Should she give of her beauty now for bread? Free and fair, She was robbed of all But her honour with its breastplate thin, And the ruined hopes were beyond repair When salvation seemed the price of sin; Yet a boundless world would lightlier fall; Calm and strong With the secret song Which is life to the heart which finds no pity, She turned to the refuge for her spread From the tempting bait and the callous City;— Should she give of her beauty now for bread? Sweet and sad, In her maiden might With its liberty of the sea and air And the glory wherein her spell was clad, She rejoiced that her God had made her fair And her gifts could return to Him as bright; Robed in pride As a spotless Bride, She stept from the love that barred its portal To the bridegroom's chamber amongst the dead, In the light of a majesty immortal;— Should she give of her beauty now for bread? A STUDY IN GRAY. O, she once might have been sainted In her innocence, as fresh As if God himself had painted Rose and lily on her flesh; As if His own hand had fingered The sweet outlines of that form, And in tender love that lingered Married snow and dew and storm. She was rich in England's beauty By our island freedom shed, With the deathless light of Duty Once was robed and ramparted. But her name, alas! is Sadness Now beneath the cruel wrong, And the thought of her seems madness That we dare not harbour long. And the peace that like a story Dwelt in brightness on her brow, Has departed with its glory, Like the breaking of a vow. And the happiness that caroled Round her pathway and led on, And the awe she was appareled In alike are gray and gone. THE BATTLE OF LIFE. I had a vision, And the dream was true; For in derision The earth no longer green, the sky not blue, But dust of Death And dim decay, Poured out mephitic air that choked my breath And closed around me grim in armed array; While torn asunder by the thunder The cloudland on my palsied head Sputtered, in twinkles dire and wrinkles, The vomit of its ruin red. Behold, the water Of the sea and land Was but one slaughter— A world of woe to glut some dark demand; And in the rolling flood Or rippled wave, The inexorable hue of haunting blood And evil odour of the accursèd grave! Each fair production gave destruction The riches of its choicest birth, And arms of iron did environ Bright creatures with their ghastly girth. I saw the blisses Of fair grass and flowers, Were mortal kisses And clothed in beauties false of fatal dowers; Their graces were just masks Of secret rot, That veiled the agony of grinding tasks Before they fell and faded and were not. Earth seemed one altar, and a halter Knit every neck with buds and spice, And beneath arching heavens were marching Blind things to the great sacrifice. I heard a crying, A long murmur pent In bodies dying, One moment whole and the next moment rent; A universal sigh, A smothered voice. That yet was lifted far and wide and high And told its hidden grief and had no choice; It was the token of work broken That simply flourished but to cease, An awful spilling for refilling Of the same sombre funeral lease. In forest places Tall trees rising threw Their thwart embraces About the feeble stems that hardly grew, And crushed them surely down With cruel stress, And from them sucked the sweetness for a crown— On others fattening proud and pitiless; The weaker blossoms fed their bosoms On weaker still and drank their life, Doom laid on Nature judicature Of never-ending, ever-starting strife. The lichen yellow, Mosses mild and green, Each slew its fellow In stern still battle to be corpse or queen; The subtle parasite With felon hand In torturing meshes fierce and infinite Spread o'er its prey the unrelenting band, And fastened slowly till the lowly Frame dropt in earth's congenial tomb, Where giant forces ran their courses And laboured in its dusky womb. Beneath the mouldering Vegetable shapes, Deep fires were smouldering And that consumption which no thing escapes; Ah, trampling on the form Of crimson cup Or emerald shaft, their shadow like a storm Fell in its blasting road and burnt them up; That in their crucible all reducible Might the old loves and links forget, And from their ashes leap in flashes As other gems awhile reset. The noblest creatures, Those without a trace Of mould or features, Contended in the same hard reckless race; Each on the other throve And died for each, In that gaunt chain of doom which Nature wove Around her victims in her strangling reach; The stout and stronger waxed and longer Were nourished by the frail and small, And hateful over the winged rover In sunshine hung a hideous pall. Foredoomed to failing's Uneluded goal, By ills and ailings And horrors of the blind uncharted shoal, Creation onward moved Unto the end, By our predestined stages tost and proved Elsewhere in other groups to blend; The baby's nestlings and the wrestlings Of powers and systems new or late, The bursting bubbles, empires' troubles Were writhings of one common fate. The bride and carriage And the widowed wife, Both marked the marriage Made ever and unmade of Death and Life; For each was either, nursed Alike on all, Through time and space by peoples blessed and cursed While ripening for fresh ranges or a fall; In maiden magic and the tragic World issues waged with earthquake breath, The eternal struggle, hopes that juggle, I see though veiled the Living Death. THE OLD FOGEY. These muscles once were taut and tense As muscles ought to be, If just a trifle too prepense At hitting full and free; For if a fellow gave me swagger Or crossed my peaceful gait, There was the stuff to make him stagger With something true and straight. But now I totter in the rear, With shrunken limbs and back, And rheumy eyes that drop a tear Unwitting now and then from fear, In youth's triumphant track; My heart is old, my life is cold, And round me gather moss and mould. My arms were sinewy and strong, And found a foremost place In every line and kept it long With woman's welcome grace; Soft eyes that met my glances brightened And rapt with pleasure burned, Sweet lips with scarlet roses heightened My ardent call returned. And now I take a quiet chair Afar from fifes and drums, And beauty none to me is fair With my gaunt frame and grizzled hair And yellow toothless gums; My day is gone that gladly shone, And lighter feet lead proudly on. It's more than hard to fancy now I ever danced and sung, And bore a high and hopeful brow Or was like others young; And these thin cheeks so seamed and wrinkled Were rounded with the best, And these scant locks with snow besprinkled Dark as the raven's breast. For now I tarry last and lone Whoever may be first, New athletes fill my early throne Or thrust me from the pavement stone And leave my heart athirst. I am as not in every lot, Condemned to droop in senile rot. My hands that erst to goodly fists Condensed and held their own, With brawny back and iron wrists, Have limp and nerveless grown; I tremble at the frost and flutter Like autumn leaves in wind, And scarce can coin the words to utter Dim cravings in my mind. And now folks always pass me by For fresher toys and tools, And children from my greeting fly Or class me with contemptuous eye Amongst the guys and fools. They do not say I stop the way, And yet I spoil their idle play. Not long ago my act could do Whate'er the will desired, I won and hardly had to woo My way and still untired; Then at my feet the world and riches In captive fulness lay, There were no bars and bolts or hitches To youth but yesterday. And now at social form and feast No pretty lips need pout, While I (old fogey) must at least— Less favoured than the petted beast— Be carefully left out. Earth has no stage for withered age, But in the final folded page. KING HODGE'S COMPLAINT. Anythin' be good enuff fur we!

In the place of the Utter Dearth Where the souls of the children stay, When they pass from the troubled earth And do cry to the Lord alway; In the darkness that aye is felt With its weight of exceeding blight, Lo, they kneel as the children knelt Through the ages and ask for Light; In the place with never a grace Where the murmuring wheels go slow, There they call till the dayshine fall On their pitiful brows below. And they build up a ladder of Prayer To the silent Heaven in love, Not a doubting of one delayer In their steps as they climb above; But the haven is steep and high Though they labour the night as well, And with many a sob and sigh, At a pathway ineffable. And they build with the tear-drops spilled, By the passion of pleading eyes, Still a road with their suffering load To their Father in Paradise. They are souls of the Children born In the shadow of evil shame, Who were plucked ere their time forlorn Without honour of any name; So they toil betwixt Day and Night And betwixt heaven and earth they live, In the blemish that must take flight If the God who is good forgive; And the sins of the father lie On the head of each little one, As they anguish and hourly die In their dolorous fate foredone. In the bourne of the Utter Dearth, They do tremblingly watch and weep For the lack of the honest hearth, From their home of the Haunted Sleep; And they beg for the kindly slayer In the task that may never cease, As they build up a Ladder of Prayer And yet crave for desired release; But the Father whose name is Love Thus is purging them clean and white, And will carry them then above To the joy that is infinite. THE ENGLISHMAN. He washed his lips with honest beer, As every Briton should, Who loves his country and the cheer Of health and hardihood. He stood broad-breasted as a tower, And imaged in his pipe At every breath the pride of power— His sentiments were ripe. Frank was his face, with labour seamed In lines, and sorrow some; And in his open glances, gleamed New empires yet to come. Though rude and racy of the soil And shaped by winter sky, He showed beneath the tan of toil A tender chivalry. A trifle surly, if you will, When babies come too fast; A word, a buffet—he could strike, And leave a manly mark— Came ready to him, each alike But never in the dark. He honoured each high instinct much, He drank of beauty springs; And finding him, you seemed to touch The fountain of all things. And none could call that being poor, Which mingled in its life The fragrance of the mount and moor, And breezy airs at strife. The flowers and morning freshnesses Were married with the flood In him, and green wood impulses Ran riot in his blood. The rustling of the heather bell And happy birds at play, O'erflowed his limbs and with their spell Made music of his day. His sinewy arms had gathered strength From many an iron storm, Which hewed by tardy strokes at length His gnarled and rugged form. But thus he grew from Nature's mould And by her broadening plan, A thing of plastic clay and gold, A true imperial man. THE BUMBLEPUPPY. I look around and see no rival fit To break with me a lance or dance a measure Of nudity and manliness, and grind Beneath our cold conventionalities With foot perfervid and indignant flight Of fancy. I am young, I see, I know, And never, never, never make mistakes; Infallibility is mine and more, The privilege of this assured estate, Prerogative of callow beardlessness— Modernity of mind. I am amazed At my own grace and cleverness, I step Aside from them and gaze and gaze enraptured Before the wealth of this large littleness, Which gathers of all times and chimes and cults And dwells alike in gilded drawing-rooms Or servants' halls, and equally at home Romps with the housemaid or dear Duchesses And steals a kiss from both impartially With calm instructed ease and gentle might, And grand indifference to the counter claims Of pigwash and the thinnest bread and butter— With educated armed neutrality. In all the best societies I live, The fast, the slow, the superfine, the mixed, The white, the blue, the black, and suck the sweetness From every one in turn. Adultery And indiscretions of the softer sort I love to dabble in, as children play With dirt and danger; they admit of art And big broad strokes, virilities, and strength Restrained, the rich sub-possibilities That prove the master's hand. I leave to fogeys And frumps the feeble milk-and-water way. Give me a canvas that will cover life, And elbow-room and air; and, if you will, From hospitals the flowers, and jeweled jests Of titled dames who to the Conqueror Ascend, with whiffs and splashes of the gutter Thrown in to add a colour and a warmth And raciness of soil and subject; I Disdain no tool, not even the apprenticeship Of others not so well equipt, but glad To work with me to one illustrious end, And clean my brushes—maids preferred—and share The hopes and joys of commensality. “RAGS AND BONES.” “Rags and bones!” There he trudges down the stones, Full of mirth and mischief's babble; Living just from hand to mouth, In and of the homeless rabble. But that mean and common cry Is, as much as thought or thunder Or the love we trample under, Part of God's great mystery. There he trudges down the stones,— “Rags and bones!” “Rags and bones!” Still the same familiar tones. His the fate that laughs at sorrow, Takes the buffets on his way All as in a working day, And regards no coming morrow; Takes the trouble or the grief As the small and doubtful pleasure, Meted with no different measure, Till it is its own relief. Yet the same familiar tones,— “Rags and bones!” “Rags and bones!” This will sound, when tumble thrones; For the lewd and lawless vagrant Will not lose his careless crown, Swimming when the mighty drown, And of deathless force is fragrant. For he cannot lower fall Than the gutter or the pavement, And is too above enslavement, King though minister of all. This will sound, when tumble thrones,— “Rags and bones!” “Rags and bones!” True as vesper chimes or nones. When the war-shout with its shaking Dies together with the creed Passing as the passing need, This will have a constant waking. Soon may dynasties be gone, And like moulting of the pigeon Men will change their old religion, But the vulgar shall live on True as vesper chimes or nones,— “Rags and bones!” HUNCHBACK AND ANGEL WINGS. Hunchbacked and foul? And yet God made me so; This piece of dark deformity Came from the fulness of His loving Heart And was His thought and of Himself a part, As much as beauty's most bewitching show, And is no mere enormity. It has a meaning and a proper place Somewhere in blue-rose gardens Above, or in the bosom of broad earth, And to the Maker's eye a secret grace; If eye of other hardens, And sees alone a land of utter dearth. Last night I dreamed of pinions— And up aloft I voyaged on great vans That oared the purple space in proud content And larger scope than any time-bound plans, With Heaven my own dominions And all the freedom of the firmament. I am assured this very hunch of mine Is one with bright and blest immortal things, A sign of something better; It will at last in unveiled glory shine And blossom into sweet white angel wings, When I have burst my fetter. I know the thorn is an imperfect flower, And shall by kindly tending Have yet a goodly ending, And even forget its nature and rude arms Forsaking these for soft and other charms And add its colour to some great Queen's bower. The balance must be one and true and right, For me just as for nations; And I was carried in God's blessed womb That bare me with a precious seed of light, And I can read the joy beyond the tomb In splendid compensations. For earth is but a stage, and many still Await the soul that travels forth and far And heeds the horizon of no single star Or constellation; but, a pilgrim rapt By upward holy vision And careless of the fleeting form or ill, With feet of firm decision Presses right onward through wide realms unmapt And belted shade and iron brute bar and shoal, In fierce and fiery chrisms Over unplumbed abysms, Straight to the grand inevitable goal. Hunchback and foul? Nay, I am wondrous fair To him who deeper looks than husk or skin, And loves and hears the flutter Of ardent unconjecturable hope In golden courts and palaces within; That steps a priest up the pure altar stair, Baulked by a prison shutter But shining out of its mean envelope, With promise of all being And infinite glad seeing. The scaffolding of strnctures that will rise Beyond our climbing fancies Or transcendental truth of wildest dreams In gentlest joyous fashion heavenly-wise, Doth veil a moment unimagined gleams Of uttermost romances; But there the Temple, crowned and sure as fate, And girt with many a column In testimony solemn, And builded by no touch of human hands Unto its orbèd calmness consummate, Inhabited by vernal Airs and the Breath Eternal, White, as of carven sunlight awful stands. A LATE FLOWER. Long grey stretches as of desert sand Lay before him, and behind Dust and darkness; And his fortune was in his own hand, Though around him unconfined Sterile starkness. Lo, he journeyed on through life, Not the noble stir of strife But a sordid path of seeking For the grains of gold beneath the dirt; No white fingers with soft sleeking Touched him, in his selfishness begirt. On his head the burden of the years Spoiled by petty greed and gain, Dully rested; And he never knew the joy of tears, Or deliciousness of pain Woman-breasted. Grasping at the shadows dim Where mirages swoon and swim, Downward still he bent and travelled; Seeing but amid the dross the ore, Not vast questions there unravelled If he stayed to wonder and adore. Then from out the wilderness and shade And his grovelling duty's close, Flashed the human; God-imagined, sweet and heavenly-made, Redder than the red blush-rose, One bright woman. And the treasures of his trust Sank to native rot and rust, Every grain stood a stern witness; For he felt his highest aims were mean, And before her dainty fitness All his grandest efforts all unclean. Thus the axis of his being turned Round to something fair and fine, At the vision; And the heart within him breathed and burned With new passion and divine Love's decision. Worthless weighed his pleasures old, In the rapture of real gold And the glory of its greatness; Till at last his life in sudden power, Reckless of the evening's lateness, Rushed into the fulness of its flower. THE WORLD'S DESIRE. No two saw her alike, but each felt The compulsion of kin And that force which for ever has dwelt In the fairness of sin; When she passed, And their fortunes were glassed In the fate of those overcast eyes, As gray skies. And the boldest who looked in her face Deemed that life without her would be hollow, Made to own the imperious grace And to follow. So the King in a moment laid down His repute for her sake, While he hung on a bramble his crown For the beggar to take; And the rich Was content with a ditch And her love, if he only might hear Or be near. And the sage turned from wisdom, and swore That her folly was sweet and far better; He put on as a garment her love, And its fetter. And the fearless who met her bright glance, Though unconquered as yet, Was involved in her train and the dance Sweeping all in its net; And the cold, At her scarlet and gold, Grew to flame in the beautiful band Of her hand. And the aged were young, when she spoke With the spells of her down-dropping lashes, And the fires of dead loves re-awoke From their ashes. O the hero threw fame to the wind And his honour set low, Whether camped in the furnace of Ind Or entombed in the snow; When she wiled With her glory and smiled In her splendour and but for a whim Upon him. For her step was a destiny strong And as swift as the path of the swallow, It constrained through the right or the wrong Men to follow. For the clerk threw aside his keen pen And the soldier his sword, At the flash of a fiercer new ken And a lustier lord; That illumed With a light which consumed, And at length while it gladdened and warmed Yet transformed. And the sorrowful recked not of grief With a hint of the touch that was madness, And discovered the balm of relief In more sadness. And the idle made haste and rose up With a passion that sped, If he tasted one drop of her cup Which would quicken the dead; And the sot Left his lust and forgot, When he drank of those wonderful charms In her arms; And the debtor remembered no due In the joy beyond words and expression, And got treasure most human and true In transgression. Ah, the honest and faithful inspired By the sorcery cast, Became softer than clay and required Now no longer the past; For they waxed Very weak, and relaxed Into shadows and lowlier shapes— Swine and apes. Iron bars at her presence were faint And the eyes that seemed hardest grew moister, While she lured though at service the saint From his cloister. And the link of the marriage dissolved Like the melting of ice, As she passed in her round that revolved Without payment or price; When the fire Of a deeper desire Fell in bosoms, and wrote in the brow A fresh vow. Yet they took the appearance of beasts And in darkness delighted to wallow, While thus doomed but to furnish her feasts And to follow. MIMNERMUS AND NANNO. Say, Nanno, is it twice or thrice A thousand years since we Toyed with the trappings of the vice, Which made thee softly free? And did I act in human form, Whilst thou upon the flute Didst conquer every human storm And win a world's repute? And have I danced with purest joy To hear thee sweetly play, And were we ever girl and boy— It seems but yesterday? Yes, we have wandered wide and far And drunk at other founts, In many a dim and distant star But by no fairer mounts. And here we meet in aching dearth To find a discrowned head, And on a squalid homeless earth We see our Hellas dead. Ah, by her broken altars fling Again thy breaking flute, And for the shadow of a king Let music now be mute. SHOEBLACK BOY. Brown as a berry, Mischievous, brave, Fond of a racket, foolishly merry, Every one's torment and every one's slave; This is the boy, Never found lacking! Winter will raven and tempest will rave, He is at home and the wild weather's joy; Skies may be cracking Thunder, and gloom cast a shadow of doom, He thinks of work and makes trouble a toy— Blossom of blacking. Cream of the gutter, Rollicking, ripe Now for your penny, to give him the butter Strange to his bread, or a casual pipe; Look at the imp Heedless of whacking, Good (if you pay him) for many a stripe Or the abuse which you need never skimp! Trade, be it slacking, Does but impel his bold heart to rebel; He will refuse to be sullen or limp,— Blossom of blacking. Grudge not the copper, All he will ask, If on his crown is not clapt your fine topper Nor on his face that hypocrisy mask; He is real grit, Wrought by the racking Cold and the heat, that delay not his task Such as Society would not deem fit. O he has backing Stouter than steel from the head to the heel, Spiced with a saucy and masterful wit— Blossom of blacking. Now in the sunlight, Now in the shade Mixed with the wild flower things that would shun light, Born in the darkness and bred but to fade; Here he stands up, When you are packing Off from the blizzard that cuts like a blade, Equal to any Queen's coin or a cup; There he goes tacking, Shoebrush and all, at a customer's call, Glad to get something whereof he may sup— Blossom of blacking. “SHE KNEW NOT HOW TO PLAY.” I brought her pretty toys and things that children love so much, At which the heart with rapture sings just from their very touch; Sweet golden showers of shining flowers That leapt from foaming green, With tops and balls and trumpet calls And wonder worlds between; But though to brighter earth and skies I gently led the way, She only looked with listless eyes—she knew not how to play. To her toys had no meaning, life was burdened with its bond Of hourly labour, hourly strife, and no blue sky beyond; No gleam of grace upon her face Had fallen for a while, No thought of rest for her confest The freedom of a smile; The forms of beauty, the kind word, which lightens half our day, Were mocking signs of bliss unheard—she knew not how to play. I told her of the pleasures stored for children such as she, That from the Heart of God outpoured their gladness like the sea; I taught her how her heavy brow Was framed for laughter's seat, And that young breast which made a nest For care was hope's retreat; But though I challenged her with song her cheeks were cold and gray, As those that dwell in darkness long—she knew not how to play. IN A CIRCLE. He fixed his burning eyes on me— Alas, the day! And bade me follow him, and see The wonders of the world to be— A bitter way, And so I followed him and went— Alas, the road!— With raiment bright and bosom rent, Unshriven though a penitent With lust as load. But never had the night a morn, And each misgiving was a thorn. He summoned me to be his slave— Alas, the woe!— And, as my dower, in passion gave A heart that was a secret grave, My chiefest foe. And then I served with willing deed— Alas, the choice!— The sin I hated, in my need, Which was the future's fatal seed And judgment voice. I served him for no golden hire, But as his fellow in the fire. He laid his burden on my head— Alas, the rood!— And nourished me with tears for bread, With husks and mockery of the dead And barren food. But faith was dreaming, earth and sky— Alas, I slept!— And God and man and mystery Were bound in awful unity, And likewise wept. For in the darkness seemed a bond, Which married all to all beyond. He made me follow him through hell— Alas, the fall!— Though there I found Salvation dwell, And heard an angel deem it well With trumpet call. I only knew the purging flame— Alas, the sin!— Could cleanse me from my evil shame, And to the fuel of my frame Was close akin. I washed me from the clinging stain, With him, to get the soil again. He would not suffer me to rest— Alas, the pangs!— And let his poison build a nest Deep in the torment of my breast, With cruel fangs. But though he chained me tighter still— Alas, the friend!— And worked on me his grievous will, I followed him through good and ill Unto the end. For he grew weary of his toy, And sought another prey and joy. I, who had fronted wrong and wrack— Alas, so late!— At length turned humbly homeward back, To the dear little house of lack And cottage gate. But there, though I had travelled o'er— Alas, my path!— The world, and gat no goodly store, I gleaned in wiser love and lore Some aftermath. I found new life for every loss, Thus in the shadow of the Cross. ROARING BILL Roaring whoring Bill Blighted from the start, Breaking now a till, Breaking now a heart. See, with tipsy step he frolics All abroad and up and down, Like an elephant and rollicks In the taprooms of the Town. With a leering eye Lewdly does he speak, Letting strong men by, Crushing low the weak. Hunky spunky Bill Liking borrowed cheer, Laps up every ill As his borrowed beer. On through reckless life he lurches From one shindy to the next, Never sets a foot in churches, Never had but drink for text. Others, fenced from sin, Cradled were in silk; He drew poison in, With his mother's milk. Heedless, creedless Bill Had no honest chance, From his birthday still Taught this devil's dance. All the taint of all the vices Rioted within his blood, And each error that entices Human wills was then at flood. Mercy's door seemed slammed On him at the first, Earth he entered damned And for crime athirst. Blackguard, laggard Bill With his brutal brain, Takes his manly fill Yet of others' pain. Want and sickness prove his merit, Like the jewel in the toad; And, though lusts he may inherit, He will lift a brother's load. He was given to death, And his mother's womb Ere he drew a breath, Was his living tomb. SWEARING SALLY. Swearing, tearing on she goes In and out the alley, Treading upon neighbour's toes If with her they dally, Like an earthquake in her throes— Dirty drunken Sally. Others, when they mark too near Those devouring paces, Deem discretion in the rear Quite the best of graces, And retire in abject fear From her vast embraces. Bawling, brawling Sally sweeps In her devious courses Through the dark and squalid deeps, Crime's sequestered sources, Whence the knife of murder creeps Out from cruel forces. Terrible as doom, and strong As the storms of nature, Noisily she rolls along Roused to her full stature, Writing with a hand of wrong Blood in legislature. Singing, swinging, heard from far, Brazen-faced and blowsy, She must call at every bar Clothed in tatters frowsy; Leaving here a scoff or scar, There a relic lousy. Sturdy is her foot and free Like some iron treadle, From her windmill progress flee Folks that fool and peddle; For with Sally on the spree, Wise men do not meddle. Weary, dreary, then she turns Sheepish home and shabby; While the heart within her yearns, Over some stray tabby, And her aching bosom burns Just to squeeze a babby. But when sleep recruits her frame, Risen as a giant Ready for the coarsest game And of all defiant, Sally still repeats her shame, Sturdy, self-reliant. BISMARCK. Man of blood and man of iron Gone to thy last dread account, Whom one world could scarce environ; All the measures that we know, Heights above and deeps below, Cannot mete thy full amount. One of Nature's Facts and Forces Whom no power but God could bend, Thou didst lead on thunderous courses Kings and kingdoms past the rocks, Through the shadows and the shocks, To their predetermined end. Lord of destiny and action, Thou didst make a people one, Moulding for no passing faction Senates to thy sovereign will; And, despite the good or ill, What thou wouldest that was done. Nothing might withstand the shaping Of that purpose, shame or shoal; From thy wrath was no escaping, Princes were thy pawns and fools, Friends and enemies the tools Working out a glorious goal. More than human, awful master Of the tidal powers that purge With the rod of red disaster Empires as they rise or fall; Passionless thyself in all, Thou was throned a Demiurge. Rulers on thee proudly leaning Gathered something of that might, And new majesty and meaning In the grandeur of a state Calm and pitiless as Fate— Heedless of a wrong or right. Churches were thy counters, nations Formed the stones whereon was built Germany for whose foundations Mingled at thy magic spell Fraud, religion, heaven and hell, Banded in a common guilt. Like some fair and fallen Creator Unconsumed with death at heart, Shalt thou live the legislator Of a Kosmos glued by blood; Sphered beyond the fire and flood, Hated, blest, accurst, apart. SECTION VI. Palms and Passion Flowers. INCARNATE LORD. INVOCATION. Breath of the living God, come down And fill my soul with sacred fire; To give the Lord a worthy crown, And clothe Him with a meet attire Who was and is the World's Desire, But seeketh not His own renown. And lift me to a loftier height, Imparadised in Love and Light; That these poor lips may proudly sing What shall become my Christ and King, And blend with music and the might Which flow from the eternal spring. Come, Holy Spirit, be Thou near And make me, if not equal quite To tasks which angels well might fear, Yet robed with innocences white And touched by passion infinite— The tones that faith afar can hear. O speak through me, most humbly bent Before Thee as an instrument, Which tries but only echoes part Of its great Teacher's aim and art; And all the ages' blind intent, Shall burst in blossom from my heart. Sweet Love of Loves, Incarnate Lord, How shall I venture close to Thee Whose purity is as a sword, From which the mountains well might flee? But yet I come, of purpose free And with Thine own in calm accord. For though Thou wearest as a dress The sun of awful Holiness, And I am soiled with many a sin; Thou are the Door to enter in, And death is but the last caress Which proves we are so nigh akin. I know these feeble words of mine Must as an idle mockery sound In that deep shadow which is shine, Though midnight by our senses found; But never bridge was like the bound, Which makes Thee dearest and Divine. And over the great gulf I mark Through the intolerable dark, A pathway like a crimson Cross; And if the flames of fury toss, They only bear me in the Ark More quickly to the Life-by-loss. Ah, though the Story of Thy Pain Is written large on earth and sky, And reaps all records in its train— The soul of each fair mystery, With issue in Eternity— Yet who shall tell the under-strain? And Thou, sweet Christ, to every breast Hast something new of rank or rest, A secret and a different side; From which no earthly pomp or pride, When Thou art really manifest, Nor powers of hell can once divide. And thus I know, whate'er I say, I must add to the goodly store, And help a soul along the way, Which leads to Peace and Heavenly lore; What never hath been said before, And now will never cease to stay. It may be little or be much, A melody or a mere touch And prophecy of better morn; But it will surely blunt a thorn Of fellow-suffering, and be such As even the Master need not scorn, So, if I only let my heart Sing what it hath of separate weal, To smoothe a wrinkle, soothe a smart Where sorrow lays its bitter seal; It will be precious balm, to heal A brother's wound in woe apart. If I am faithful to the note, Which sadness in the darkness wrote Deep in me with its iron pen; I shall enlarge a neighbour's ken, Though it but take away a mote Within one ray rejoicing men. But still I tremble to set bare All that Thou, Saviour, art to me; Who liftest up a common care, And teachest in the flower or tree; Nor dost in grief, when sunbeams flee, Despise a more than equal share. Our union and communion sweet When in a solemn tryst we meet, So sacred and so private are; To whisper ought may leave a scar Upon the precious Hands or Feet, And cloud the brightness of the Star. O doth the newly-wedded bride Reveal each tender clasp or kiss Which draws her to the bridegroom's side, And welds a closer bond by this? Would she profane their perfect bliss, By babble uttered far and wide? How shall I dare unbosom all To curious ear or vulgar call, Of what Thy tenderness hath been— The songs unknown, the joys unseen; And Love that softened every fall From happy heights, and came between? But something I may yet unfold And lift the curtain for a space, That reverent eyes may here behold A glimmer of Thy glorious Face, And guess the fulness and the grace— Though half the wonder be untold. I will adventure for the weak, On whom misgivings often wreak The cruel wrong of deadly doubt; To let in part the secret out, And hint (what none can rightly speak) The splendour wrapping me about. Lo, at the midnight hour, when sleep Forsakes me for the solemn sense Of Thy great Presence and a Deep Beyond the darkness when most dense; Thou comest, in a Truth intense, A Lover with a watch to keep. I see not, but my blackest care Is one with what Thy Passion bare, And turns to sunshine the unrest; I know Thou art my Spirit's guest, Heart within heart, and am aware Of a Divinely-beating Breast. The touch not of a mortal hand Falls on mine own, as fingers press Which are a flame and must command Response by rapture of their stress; The pain of such deliciousness, I would not if I could withstand. But though unearthly, and not wrought Of flesh and as ecstatic thought Which asks for ransom of reply; They thrill my being and defy Our common bars, and give unsought The breadth of all Humanity. Then like a cactus flowers the night From out the superincumbent gloom, And something more than prophet sight Makes infinite my little room; It breaks into a sudden bloom, With avenues of endless light, The walls of bounding space are gone, And brightness which hath never shone Above an earthly sea and shore Talks to me of celestial lore; And in Thy Grandeur I live on, All lives which saints have lived before. The laws of time, the limits set By nature on the eye and ear, No longer fetter me or fret The mind, and every cause is clear; Unveiled I view, with gladsome fear, What few can see and then forget. Love reigns the Sovereign Lord, and none Loses delight in what is done; Abundance and the desert dearth, Are kindled at a common Hearth; And beauty and the truth seem one, While earth is Heaven and Heaven is earth. The meaning of the Cross grows plain, It is the shelter of Thine Arms So often pierced with human pain— When we had chosen fleeting charms, And heeded not their fatal harms— Sore pierced again and yet again. Lo, it is scored upon the sky, And painted in the agony Of rushing wind and writhing cloud; And in the shadow of the shroud Which marks each thing's mortality, It speaks with ruddy lips aloud. For Thou and It no longer part, Merged in the same triumphant end Attained but by celestial art; And as one broken bleeding Heart Unite to be a fairer start, Whence man and God alike ascend. If morning comes and mists disperse Yet the whole mighty universe, Redeemed from death and evil dross By suffering and a daily loss, Will rest on (what all times rehearse) The blessed Passion of the Cross. I feel the destiny, I find The awful stress of earthly things, Which we a petty moment bind And harness to our hopeful wings; For in our feeblest flutterings, Thou art the same, though unconfined. Dear Lord, Thy love for ever throbs In thunder anthems and the sobs Of bursting breasts that reap their due; The sure and saving golden clue Which, if a bitter sentence robs Our lives of all, remaineth true. The systems come, the systems go, Like ceaseless bubbles on a stream Which must for ever onward flow Through changeful tracts of gloom and gleam; And if they are an idle dream, Thy Mercy gives to each its glow. Yes, in the petal of the flower Which only claims the dew as dower, And in the planet's dreadful sweep; There is a glory which we keep, And beats a pulse's common power Untouched by death, unsought of sleep. Where art Thou not? However short The shadow of the winter day, Wherein we seem the wretched sport Of evil spirits at their play; Thine is the one redeeming ray, To guide us safely into Port. The breath of liberties to be Uplifted in a nation's plea, Is Thine as truly as the plaint In bondage of some pure-souled saint; And like the movement of a sea, Which rolls above a world's restraint. When wast Thou absent? At the dawn Of young creation didst Thou stand, Ere purple night with stars was strawn, Co-builder at our God's right hand; To fence the ocean from the land, And bid old Chaos be withdrawn. Even when the primal lamb was slain, Or in the ministry of pain Man offered up a costlier price; The precious blood, the fragrant spice, To Thee all witnessed not in vain And showed the deeper Sacrifice. The centre and the source of each Great Kosmic outcome, or the act Of private effort's petty reach Spent (and in mere unsplendid fact) Ere it can ripple to the beach, And merge in some sublimer pact; Thy Guardian Spirit governs both And keeps with them a constant troth, Be it a meanness or a mount; Alike in all Thy careful count Preserves the barren lands from sloth, And warms them at one blessed Fount. Thy wondrous method hath its way On heaven and earth, it rules the stars; And is that sad Divine delay Of progress won through iron bars, With bitter scorn and jewelled scars— The light of darkest disarray. It triumphs over change and chance, And moulds the gloom of circumstance Until it leaps and laughs and shines; In sweating mills and swarthy mines, It is the secret ordinance And mainspring of eternal lines. O Saviour, I but kiss the hem Of that grand Beauty which is more Than words, and with its stately stem Props planets on their shifting shore; It holds the future too in store, And precious thought's pure Diadem. When I would syllable the grace Of that which only hides Thy Face, And dazzles us with sweet defence; I feel my work is poor pretence, And mars the orbit beyond space Or mocks Thy dread magnificence. But still no creature is so mild As Thou, O dear unsetting Sun, Amid our failures weak and wild Along the path which we would run; Thou, ere these systems had begun And still, the Everlasting Child. For, though more awful than the flame Which bursts the bondage of its frame, Thou art the gentlest thing no less; And in Thy soft and righteous dress, Lo, I can cloke my sinful shame Or play with Thy meek Loveliness. Ah, silence Lord, doth praise Thee more, With sealed lips and upturned look That maketh but of Thee its boast; In love, that like a quiet brook Goes murmuring round a mighty coast And chants in some forgotten nook. This heart would only break with bliss To sing Thee more, that sings amiss; I am content to gaze and hark Or toss with Thee inside the Ark, To face the fears of the abyss And voyage through the unmapt dark. Adored One, my Redeemer, Friend, The Husband to outlive each tie Of fading earth that soon must end, When all upon Thy Breast must lie; With Thee I live, with Thee I die, And fall that thus I may ascend. Thou wast before the birth of time, And mad'st the music for its chime; While every land is fair and sweet, For the pure passage of Thy Feet, And saddest souls in every clime With Thee at last must somewhere meet. PAIN THE DIVINE. O blessèd Pain, I look to thee For all the comforts that I know, The music in the mourning strain, The fruit upon the blasted tree More sweet than any fruit below. Whate'er is fitter Or beautiful and fine and sweet, Is by the bitter— The deadly secret drop at core, Or surly dross that hides the ore— Made wonderful and wise and meet. O Blessed Lord, Thou art more near And precious in the test of flame, Beneath the judgment of the sword Or solemn night of sudden fear, Than at the silken ease of shame. It is the cruel Sharp nail, or crimson-flowering thorn, Which grows a jewel Deep in the wounded brow or breast, And frets the weary soul to rest As though on Thine own Bosom borne. Thrice-holy pain, Thy passion streams Forth from the broken Heart of God; It flows through all the golden gain Which, mingled of our deeds and dreams, Opens new joys of worlds untrod. Thou art the marrow, Of sturdy toil that rounds the days; Else were they narrow, Poor sheeptracts and the narrow ruts Of tameness which on trifling shuts, And not the broad imperial ways. Thrice Holy Lord, This is Thy Life, The very pulse that in Thee beats And moulds our minds in true accord With Thee, and blossoms out of strife— It stirs the systems' hidden seats. Thy crown of Glory Is not the risen and radiant star, A triumph story; But agony of Love and Loss, Which smiles in rapture o'er the Cross, Whereat the gates of Death unbar. Divinest Pain, Mysterious food, Thou givest all the spirit asks; While nerving arms that else in vain (The sport of some rebellious mood) Were braced to meet their iron tasks. Monarchs and ermined High judges tread Thy troubled road, Dim but determined From everlasting; and the sheen Of beauty, shed by bloom or queen, Were nought without Thy piercing goad. Divinest Lord, Thy perfect will Demands the payment of the pangs Which strike in Thee a common chord, And make us partners though they kill— Eternity upon them hangs. Thy throne majestic Is built of sadness, and finds woes Dear and domestic; And only he can reign as king Who with Thee walks through suffering, Shaken and shaped by fiery throes. FINIS.</field>
