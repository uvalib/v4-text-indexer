      <field name="fulltext">ODO, COUNT OF LINGEN: A POETICAL TALE. CANTO I. Five hundred years, and more, have passed away, Since in yon low-fall'n city held his reign A Prince, who well becomes the Muse's strain. A rude but valiant people own'd his sway; Nor other Court, on that heroic day, Beauty could shew, so form'd the heart to gain. Amid the tribes, the Prince around him drew, One friend above the rest his bosom knew: A man of brilliant intellect and form; One, whom ambition would to rashness warm: Who gloried most to battle with the storm. Odo, the Count of Lingen, was his name: A lineage old, not wealthy, he could claim: And now he hoped to gild an ancient race; And add to all the shadowy rights, that trace Their source to founts no common eyes can find, The gold and rank which win a vulgar mind. He loved, alas, the coarse applause assign'd To vulgar greatness by the noisy crowd Of flattering multitudes; and when the loud Shout rent the skies, and round about his car, Before, behind, the clamourous numbers pressed, His big heart swell'd “And thus” he cried, “my star! “Thus shine for ever! Fortune at my feet “Crouches her potent wand!” — And then he bless'd His fate, and murmur'd: “my ambition's sweet! “It has no falls; it has no clouds; and round My temples an unfading wreath is bound!” The Prince with gladness saw his favourite's fame And wealth increase; while still affairs of state Own'd his relieving hand; and drew the weight On shoulders not his own; — For who can blame The love of ease, that fondly flies the thorns Of wily politics; and loves to sport On perfumed beds of flowers, and gently scorns The moil of man's conflicting wants? In Courts Tis still the same: The Minister must bear The price of honours; — labour, danger, care! In truth the Prince had reason good to fly All vulgar joys; and in oblivion sweet All vulgar cares to lose: his raptured eye A form before it saw, whose beauteous mien Could make the heart of Anchorite to beat; The loveliest Dame, in halls of Princes seen; Charm of all gazers, of each heart the Queen! And him this Star of brightness bless'd; his hand, To her betroth'd, the faithful pledge of love On her white finger had imposed; and She Bow'd with soft chearfulness to his command; With downcast looks her duty sought to prove; Breathed out her soul in every tender sigh; And hail'd the day, that tied the band, with extasy! Odo, well pleased to see his master's mind, Caught in the net of love, cast off the rein Of State to him with trust uncheck'd and blind, Sought not the wildering rapture to restrain; But yielded up with spirit unreprest To her, who ruled it, his fond Sovereign's breast. Bertha, in turn with gracious eyes beheld The Servant, by whose toils her Lord possess'd Leisure, content and frecdom! She repell'd With gentle disbelief the tale, that dress'd In hues of dark design his active zeal: “Tis for himself,” the busy whispers said, “Tis for himself his ceaseless labours steal “Slumber from night; and waste his vigorous frame. “The glory will be his: for him will spread “The feast! for him the shouts of mobs exclaim! “And when his power is link'd, and when the hold “Of his dominion has its fixture due, “O then will that dissembling eye be bold “With unveil'd insolence; and the mean crew “Of mercenary multitudes, that cling “To his proud heels, their caps in air will fling; “And hail with brawls Count Odo for their King!” Sweet Bertha heard with disbelief; but deep And long she pondered, what her heart forbade To entertain with credence: in her sleep Oft would the thought return, and make her sad: But yet, as reason ruled, her generous breast Suspicion of a guilt so base represt. Count Odo, dress'd in smiles, with lofty air, Self-confident, and happy, as the course Of courtly forms required, from day to day Still met the lovely Princess: nor would spare Th'obeisance that became his rank to pay: To his proud spirit it was still no force; He look'd upon her lovely face; and there He saw a charm that monarchs might obey. But while he worship'd, thoughts would sometimes stray; And from his trembling eye there shot a beam, That guileless Bertha knew not how to deem; If it were doubt or awe, or th'insult it would seem! Days pass'd; and months as quick; and twice the race Of the revolving Sun with rapid pace Had ended: yet the rays of Bertha glow'd With warmth increasing in her Monarch's sight; Goodness had lustre on her charms bestowed; And as her form was fair, her soul was bright. From her loved lips wisdom and sweetness flow'd; And the Prince listen'd as to one divine. Led by her counsel; by her eloquence Enraptured; 'twas his glory to resign His thoughts to hers; and as a fountain pure Of virtue and of wisdom blended, thence Love as of inspiration to dispense. Odo, half charm'd, half wondering, sometimes caught The tones that with such high dominion rul'd His master's soul; they seem'd so sweetly fraught With unassuming peace; so little school'd In the world's turmoils; so in love with calm Of trees, and murmuring rills, and song of birds, And all of nature's incense; lowing herds; And bleat of flocks, and echo from the woods, And groan of winds, and fall of roaring floods; And utter'd such persuasion of the balm Of joys like these, for whom the' assaults of life Have wounded in its rude relentless strife, That he was safe, while from a draught so pure His Master drew delirium, for it taught That bold Ambition ills and curses wrought; And if she held her dreaming Lord in lure Twas but to make his love of quiet sure. But with Count Odo, e'en as with the Queen, The gossip Fame her meddling schemes would plot: The fiend declared, it ne'er was woman's lot To hold the potent wand her charms had gain'd; Yet spare to let it to the world be seen!” “The day will come” with many a nod and smile And sly grimace, the medler said, “tho' slow, “The day will come, however deep the guile, “When all the wanted swing of rule attain'd, “Odo the force of Bertha's hand shall know.” The Count attentive heard the sad presage; And oft he turn'd it in his thought profound: Well did he con the tale of every age; And all he con'd mature reflection crown'd. “I must not lightly list this gossip's tongue: “What wisdom thinks, the gossip oft has sung. “Divided empire women will not bear: “When Pleasure tires, they take the task of Care.” Thus to himself the Count in sorrow spoke: Oft on his lips the quivering murmur moved; And oft the deep sigh from his bosom broke: The heaving mask, upon his face he bore, The storm that beat beneath it often proved: But smiles at court and gladsome gests he wore; And still to Bertha dress'd his looks in awe, And admiration by respect subdued; And seem'd, as if he in her beauty saw One whom from love Ambition could not draw: One who believed the paths of Peace were strew'd Alone with flowers of happiness and good! Bertha beheld beneath the painful guise Some secret movements lurking in his eye: Cross its bright beam a passing vapour flies; Under its laugh of joy is treachery! The Prince with looks of favour still survey'd The friend, whose zealous labours left him free To live with Bertha in retirement's shade; The tangles of her lovely hair to braid; Calmly to sleep beneath th'umbragious tree; And taste from nature's charms the true felicity. “Bertha,” he cried, “was ever Prince so blest, “As is the lot thy grateful husband shares? “Thy tender eyes, thy tuneful voice attest, “My happy look no false appearance wears! “Lock'd in thine arms, I lose all anxious cares; “While Odo takes the task my taste foregoes; “And friendship crowns the joys, that love bestows!” “My gracious Lord!” said Bertha, “I can ill “Repay the goodness, that must ever fill “My mind with gratitude, respect, and love! “Exults my bosom, if my Lord approve “My humble form: and if the little worth, “And slender gifts that Nature on my birth “Has lotted, can content thy generous heart; “What warmth of language can my joy impart? “But, O my Lord and Sovereign, do not deem “Thy Bertha too presumptuous, if she seem “For once to touch on ground beyond her sphere: “I would not damp the happiness, whose rays “With light unclouded to thine eyes appear; “Nor chill with mean ungenerous fears the praise “That unsuspecting Virtue burns to raise “To deeds of fair import: but, O my Sire, “Tho' Bertha's love be true; (for, if the fire, “That beams in yonder stars, be true, the flame “That burns in Bertha's bosom is the same,) “Yet Odo's friendship calls the searching eye. “Is my Lord sure, that in his zeal there glows “No selfish ardor? in his cares and toils “No schemes of treacherous grandeur interpose? “No dark plot broods beneath his glosing smiles?” A deathlike chill arrests the Prince's heart; Through all his veins wild trembling horrors dart. “My Bertha, is it thus? Hast thou a cause, “From whence thy thought this sad suspicion draws?” At length he cried with mournful tone: “My Lord” She answer'd mildly, “it would ill accord “With the strict duty that I owe, to say, “I have a cause for thoughts I thus betray! “I have no proper cause: they are the shades; “The wild surmises that distress my brain: “I would dismiss them; but each dream upbraids “My long-kept silence: they return again; “And bring grief, wailings, murder in their train!” She ceased; but drop'd a tear: and as her voice Died on her lips, the Prince with soft caress Chear'd her despondent spirit. “Raise thy soul, “Bertha, beyond these Phantoms, that rejoice “Fiend-like to trouble human happiness; “And when the tides of rapture highest roll, “Then most with their infernal fangs to press!” Her eye look'd gently thro' the vapoury cloud, That veil'd its brightness; and she strove to raise The Hope, that beamily through darkness plays. But yet terrific visions would enshroud The struggling rays of chearfulness, — “O hear! “Bertha; the voice of Nature cries! thine ear “Is tuned to joy: come, listen to the grove, “Where all is peace, and purity, and love. “Dream no more dreams of sadness! Virtue dwells “Safe from th' assaults of mad Ambition's wiles: “Around her sacred haunts she casts her spells; “Nor fears Intrigue's designs, or Treason's smiles.” “If prayers, my Lord;” said Bertha: “if the glow “Of heart devote and grateful can bestow “Security, my Sovereign is secure! “Long as his virtuous wishes, shall endure “The happiness he merits: but beware! “My Sovereign, O beware: with piercing eye “The secrets of thine Odo's bosom try: “Virtue, that never asks the test to spare, “The mirror to its inmost thoughts can claim; “And come forth purer from the searching flame!” She spake: and then with downcast eyes withdrew; But first ask'd pardon for her frank discourse; The Prince in sadness to his closet flew; There strove each word and accent to renew; And give to each dark hint its native force. “What means this stain on Odo's faith?” “he cried: “Have baseless dreams alone the thought supplied? “Ah no! my Bertha! thy sagacious mind “Was ne'er to faith of baseless dreams inclined! “Illumined soul! Effluence of all that's wise! “No phantoms false delude thy searching eyes — “There must be truth in what thy lips proclaim! “Delusion never from that bosom came! “Yet pause my fear! if most I owe to Love, “Still Friendship also must my firmness prove. “Odo, the friend of years, my youth's compeer, “True in the field, when death was raging round, “And ever faithful mid the faithless found, “Shield of my life against the rebel spear, “Clad by my favours, lifted by my hand, “All power he asks, and more at his command — “Is Odo faithless? he, by whom I'm woo'd “With seeming tears of boundless gratitude? “Then life's a lying dream: and Virtue's boast “A phantom, soon in baseless visions lost!” END OF CANTO I. CANTO II. When next the Count before the Prince appear'd, The Sovereign bent his searching eye; and saw The light smile twinkle still; and yet he heard The soft tone of a mind that murmur'd joy. “My gracious King” he said, “whose wish is law, “Whose happiness is my untired employ; “Is aught of pleasure wanting to the day? “Can aught be wanting to the Lord, whose bliss “Bertha, in virtue as in form supreme, “Guards by her care, and crowns by her caress? “Wide through all Europe let the Enquirer stray; “Bertha's angelic graces are the theme!” “Yes — Odo — yes — in Bertha's beauty reigns “Each fascinating charm the Poet feigns. “— But beauty, — Odo!” — and he look'd with brow Somewhat intent, as if to search his soul: — “Beauty is fading; 'tis the mind's controul, “To which the hearts and heads of Princes bow!” “In Bertha's wisdom lies the wondrous spell, “That holds dominion o'er thy Sovereign's love.” — He ceased; and Odo smiled; but in the cell Of his dark bosom vapours seem'd to move. “My Sovereign, in whom all my hopes are bound; “Of my affections, as my duty, Lord! “It glads my soul that thy desert is crown'd “With gift of female virtues, that accord “With those that in my Sovereign's bosom shine: “And faith and love, as Bertha's lot, be thine! “There is in woman, when her beauteous form “The rays of an angelic spirit warm, “A charm of goodness, Evil dare not try! “They flash; and Fiends of Darkness trembling fly! “When the flame's false alone; when beams of light “Raised by lewd love are mischievously bright, “Those Fiends beneath the frigtful lustre play, “And bask luxuriant in delusive day!” — “Wisdom” the Prince replied, “is ever rife “On Odo's lips: and eloquence distills “From his persuasive tongue; my soul it fills “With glow ineffable, when she, my life, “My joy, the spring-tide of my earthly bliss, “Is Odo's praise: what praise can be like his?” Thus Princes list the soothing tones, that melt Upon their ears; and thus the Mage supplies The grateful sounds his cunning art has spelt Play best upon their heart-strings! Who denies That Courtiers are magicians, and can wield Wands that make Monarchs to their magic yield. And where is Bertha? Lo! the Prince's eyes Demand the radiant beauty of her mien: With graceful step let lovely Bertha now, The smile of tenderness upon her brow, In all the glory of her charms be seen! She comes. “Supreme in beauty, goodness, soul, “And heart, what fiery tides of rapture roll “Their torrents thro' my bosom, as I view “My Bertha's angel form approach my sight! “Immingled like the rainbow's changing hue, “All charms play round thee in successive light!” — “My Lord, my Sovereign!” in a tender voice Cried Bertha: “spare my blushes: I rejoice “Beyond what words can tell, that it is mine “To have the bliss of love so pure as thine! “But we are mortals, and we must submit “To the decree that human kind is born “Not to unmixed bliss on earth: I mourn “To cast a transient shadow that may flit “Across this radiant vision of my fate: — “But I am conscious of my earthly state; “And Sovereigns, like your virtuous self, must know; “For man, as there is joy, there must be woe!” Quick changed the Monarch's face: the look that beam'd With rapture, turn'd to sable thoughtfulness: In such rejection of his joy there seem'd A secret, that the boldest might oppress! Bertha, whose watchful cares incessant strove The wishes of her honour'd Lord to learn, Trembled, when she beheld the aspect stern Of him, whose eyes an instant past beam'd love: “My Lord,” in tears she murmur'd, “if in aught “Thy Bertha has offended, O forgive “Her weakness; for thy Bertha not in thought “Has err'd: nor can her faithful bosom live “Beneath thy frowns: it was the fear to lose “A bliss too high for earth, that cast its hues “Of black upon the vision, where the blaze “Had beam'd to other eyes unblemish'd rays.” “Enough, my Bertha; or in joy of heart, “Or in the tender notes of thoughtful care, “Thy looks and words a charm to me impart, “Bertha's angelic face alone can wear; “And only Bertha's tuneful lips can breathe: “Go; from the meads a verdant chaplet wreathe; “And we will live unfading flowers beneath!” Bertha was calm'd: “I go, my Lord” she cried: “How sweet the task, in midst of nature's pride, “To crop the treasures, that her bounty throws “From the green earth — the violet, and the rose; “All the young spring's first birth, whose fragrance sends, “Borne upward floating on the wings of air, “Sweet streams of incense, that their offering bear “To their Creator: while my heart attends “The mute devotion; aud its accents lends “To hymn the note of gratitude and prayer!” All in the Court went smoothly; Odo's hand Guided affairs of State uncheck'd: within The palace-bowers Beauty and Sweetness fann'd The flame of Love; while yet Ambition's din No schemes to trouble Odo's empire plann'd. But Power is ever jealous: in the breast Deep lie the gnawing fears; there is no rest, When the eye frowns; or when the passing cloud Seems for a moment favour to enshroud. Sly malice; green-eyed Envy, ply their trade; And boil the cauldron, of all mischief made: “Is Bertha then thy friend?” the glosing tongue, As if the words of friendship on it hung, Exclaims, “I heard a whisper, Odo, say, “Him, we most praise, we most devote to fall; “And him we vow to death, a friend we call! “If Bertha smiles then, is it to betray?” “It cannot be!” cried Odo, as in ire; But to his heart deep sunk the subtle fire. A year of tranquil happiness had past: Bertha was superstitious; in her joy Many a lone hour was given to fearful thought: Her bosom whisper'd, “O that I could cast “Far to the winds forebodings, that employ “This mind, of woe and melancholy wrought! “There is a calm, that comes before the storm; “When all is stillest, then I dream, the last “Of this unequal'd bliss I feel, is near.” So came cold tremors o'er her melting form; And down her cheek descended the big tear, And paled the roses of her beauteous face; And left the hue of sorrow in their place. If Bertha's Lord was great in birth, and power, Not less renown'd was Bertha's natal hour. Her brother from his Sires a realm possest, Whose strength and splendor Glory's rolls attest. Rumour soon brought the tidings to his ear, That Bertha's cheek betray'd the frequent tear. He wonder'd what a heart so good could ail, With all besides that could to bliss avail; And grieved by fits; by fits repell'd the tale. Odo, no less, at Bertha's alter'd eye Look'd with suspicious wondering treachery. Why gathering in that bosom's inmost shrine Lies the deep sigh? Why with deep musings pine Those eyes once beaming with unmingled love? Does the skill'd mariner neglect the sign, That gathers in the sky? He looks above; And in a speck the brooding tempest sees; Shall I, less skill'd, refuse the mark to seize; And when I safe may sail before the breeze Into the port, blindly remain behind; And perish, for my folly, in the wind? “Those looks of sadness do but ill accord “With Bertha's wonted love!” exclaim'd her Lord. “Has aught of discord touch'd those tender strings “Of harmony? or from what sources springs “That cloud, thy smiles can break by fits alone? “Sits not thy monarch on his former throne? “Is thy heart changed? Or can its flame decay; “Or turn aside the beamings of its ray?” “My Lord, once just, once generous!” thus replied The astonish'd Princess, “I could have defied “The shaft of sharp reproach from other lips! “I scarce believe my trembling ears, from thee “When come the deadly accents! not to me “Belongs the dart, that every blessing strips “From the sad soul, at which its point is aim'd!— “My soul, instructed by some voice divine, “Bow'd to its presages; and I am blamed! “But witness is that dart unkind of thine, “I did not err; I listen'd to the truth: “And now the woe is come that it foretold. “O do not speak in anger but in ruth! “With what hard armoury could I be bold “Against such warnings, that my soul o'erawed? “The sun is smiling round thee; but abroad,” It said “a distant tempest in its cave “Works, whose forth-rushing and o'er-whelming wave “In vain shall all thy strengh essay to brave! “It comes: that voice of thine the tempest is: “Thus is my fate fulfill'd: thus ends my bliss!” Thus spake she; and then fainted; on her brow Death seem'd his hideous pallidness to throw; Lifeless each limb; no pulse appear'd to flow. The Prince alarm'd, from mid the' attending crew Call'd aid, that quickly to his summons flew; And Bertha, slow reviving, tremulous said Thro' tears of joy, “the bliss of love renew'd “Pays for the pain of dreading love decay'd! “My Lord, the ruler of my soul, no more “On fancied evils shall my bosom brood: “Its trusting calm affection shall restore, “And list alone to Hope's enchanting lore!” When our undoubting lips first touch the cup, That Love with his celestial beverage fills, From the full brim no crossing tremor spills An atom of the draught; we drink it up: Pure from the base transparently distills The liquid inspiration: but, in hour Of omen ill, if once the shaking hand Disturb the heavenly nectar; then no more Can Faith return'd its purity restore; Nor fears renew'd the steady nerve withstand! Now fits of love, and fits of doubt again Came like the varyings of an April day: Bertha would sigh; and Albert would complain: Bertha protested; and her Lord was gay. Odo, whose eyes and ears were ne'er at rest, Knew all that past, and nursed it in his breast. “Th' occasion good; the spring” he cried “is set; “And wide and sure is spread the' unsparing net.” The moody humour of the Prince's mind Grew with each month more thoughtful and unkind. Bertha grew paler, as the falling tear Wash'd every trace of pleasure from her cheek: And ere the close of a revolving year, Hope fled, in other breasts her home to seek. “She spurns my love!” said Albert: “how she broods “On other joys and other thoughts than mine! “Some absent wretch upon her soul intrudes; “And prompts her for forbidden bliss to pine! “O what is woman, but deceit and wrong? “The love she can command, she holds in scorn: “Proscribe th'indulgence, and her passion's strong; “And whom the loveliest charms of form adorn, “To her does most the evil heart belong!” Earl Raymond heard with grief, that tore his breast, Tbe sorrow that fair Bertha's fate opprest: — Bertha, a sister who his infant years Had shared in sweet affection; whom in tears He saw transplanted to another soil; Yet hoped that in a generous Prince's care No blasts of rudeness or of ire would dare The pure flowers of her happy heart despoil! He heard, and doubted still; for Albert's name Stood high amid the rolls of virtuous fame; And long he knew his soul a soul of fire, That wont to rise above the groveling mire Of mean r Passions, and uncheck'd aspire To all that Love in its sublimest flights Could give to female Virtue's tenderest rights! To question Virtue is a deep offence, Never erased from the generous brain: It well behoved him then to use pretence Less odious, the true tale to ascertain. In dark disguise and in a changed name To Albert's Court with anxious heart he came, With Bertha's self to seek an interview. But long he sought in vain; and oft he grew Impatient of his task; at length he found A dame who listen'd to a flattering tale; And on a day of feast, when all around Was noise and tumult and the mingling sound Of music, and the watch was wont to fail Of Argus' eyes, she bore him to the Queen, Who with an haggard look and starting mien Survey'd his face, and heard the tender tone Of his low voice; and then with wild affright Cried “Raymond, does thy spectre meet my sight? “What means this wonder?” — “Bertha, hush! Alone “And secret I would fain confer with thee! “I pray thee quickly name the place and hour: “And dearest Bertha, let it sacred be!” “My Raymond, always loved, now more beloved “Than ever by a bleeding, broken heart, “If, in this time of need, thou hast the power “To shew th' affection, thou so oft hast proved, “Come to thy suffering Bertha: but beware: “Each step thou takest, there my be a snare: “Guard every look, each word; and guard the veil, “That brought thee hither; or perchance we die! “To morrow, when Eve closes, and the pale “Moon lights her feeble guidance, I will fly “To the close bower of jasmine and of rose, “In the south corner of the Orange grove; “There shall my faithful Raymond hear the woes, “That first his Bertha to despondence drove!” — “Enough! impatient I the call await; “And till th' appointed time each minute count!” Slow went the hours, in wildering self debate: Long as a month appear'd their sad amount. “Sun! hasten on thy course: thou hast a glare “Too strong for the dark colours of my heart! “Thy painful radiance on its tumults spare; “Nor blaze the gangrene of the poison'd dart! “The soothing mantle of Night's shadowy car “To my sick bosom is more grateful far!” — The West was all on fire: the orb of Day, Half pillow'd on the wave, its golden light Threw upward and around; then took its flight, Dropping behind the Ocean; and each ray E'en in an instant faded quite away: This sudden disappearance of the Sun may be observed in the Mediterranean. And Eve came sailing on a purple cloud, All objects in her dusky veil to shroud! Raymond flew trembling to th' appointed place; And tender Bertha rush'd to his embrace. “What ails my Bertha? Ope that gentle breast, “In which no thought of Evil e'er could rest! “What ill can touch a breast so pure as hers? “Where is the shrine, that blest Content prefers?” — “I fain would tell thee, Raymond, but I fear: “Doubting the truth, which ought to meet thine ear! “Thou know'st how pure to Heaven the altar bore “The vows of faith, to Albert's love it wore! “Pure as they were, still, Raymond, they are pure; “And will, while beats this feeble pulse, endure. “Would'st thou believe? have patience, while I tell! — “That Albert doubts them now! O do not swell “With ire so furious! if thou wilt not quell “That mad vindictive look, I can no more “Into that pitying heart my sorrows pour! “Albert deserves not anger! 't is his love, “That bids his heart these pangs injurious prove: “Anger would fix the dark disease, that preys “Upon his heart, but yet admits a cure: “'Tis gentleness and reason's voice, that sways “The noble breast, misled by error's lure! “O Raymond, time and patience, and kind tears, “And prayers, and good for ill, would melt an heart “Of stone; and ne'er can it be Albert's part, “To spurn the prayers which e'en Unkindness hears! “Go, generous Brother: leave to Virtue's power “The bosom to reclaim, which evil hour “Turn'd to a momentary cruelty! “Go, — while thy visit is a secret, fly: — “Hide thy suspicion; or my fate is cast! “Feel with what agony, as if the last, “I press upon thy cheek this fond embrace; “And take a farewell of my brother's face!” She sigh'd; she wept; she press'd her trembling arms Around her Brother's neck; and she was gone! Then flying to her inmost chamber, free She gave her soul to sorrow's worst alarms: And thro' the night, and to the peering dawn, All was despair, distraction; agony. — “Tears, Bertha, still! to meet me still in tears! “Is this a consort's duty? these her charms? “The flame of love decays in clouds of fears; “And Grief' chill showers the tender sparks suppress! “My Bertha once those eyes in smiles could dress; “And all was confidence; and all was joy! “Does she trust Albert's wonted faith no more? “Or what dark thoughts her wandering mind employ?” Then frowning as he spoke, he quick withdrew; And roam'd alone, that he might ponder o'er The sombre images, that would pursue Each other through his agitated brain; And while to change their course he strove in vain, Blacker and blacker, as he ponder'd, grew! — In Odo's converse he alone could find A transient solace for his wounded mind: Odo, who blasted by a faint defence Her, for whose hapless cause he seem'd to plead; And, while a healing balm was his pretence, At each new accent made the bosom bleed With added poison; till the deep disease, Prepared for all the phantoms, that can seise The heart's recesses, gave itself a prey To wild Imagination's darkest sway. Mysterious looks were in the Court; a gloom Was spread about, around; as if a doom Was gathering, rife to burst; but when, or where, On whom to fall, met not the wondering ear! Odo, with face as if involved in grief, Seem'd mid the tribes of mystery the chief: But in the tones of that low mournful voice There was an undergleam, that pierced disguise: And said, “beneath that sable covering lies “Some ray, that bids the secret heart rejoice!” Albert, astounded, melancholy, wild, Exclaim'd: “if generous Odo has beguiled “His Prince's sorrows; let him pour the balm “Now on his bosom, and the tempest calm! “Grief is contagious; Bertha's eyes of gladness “Are turn'd to weeping; and upon the brow, “Where soft Affection spoke the' eternal vow, “Sit the black clouds of bitterness and sadness! “Thus spreads the sorrow round; and every face, “Where pleasure wont the genial halls to grace, “Catches the hue of woe, suspicion, fear, “And sick lament; and all my feasts appear “But the sad rites of the funereal bier!” — “My Lord and Sovereign!” with a pitying look, As if from his false eyes truth only spoke, Cried Odo, “we are born to ill on earth; “And even Princes share the common lot; “Young Hope, at early stages from our birth, “Springs up, the scenes of future joy to plot; “Before the visions of futurity “A veil of bright delusive flowers he builds; “And to the trusting inexperienced eye “Each nearer prospect with false radiance gilds. “A little while in life's all-chequer'd day “The sun's fair beams by clouds unthwarted play: “But the storm gathers soon; and when delay'd, “It comes back with a mightier swing and roll, “As if it would the moments lost upbraid; “And fix a deeper terror on the soul! “Albert, whose race in Time's long track is known “By never-conquer'd fortitude of mind, “May hear the rains descend and tempests groan, “Yet solace in his glorious spirit find! “Above the storms of Fate 'tis his to raise “His head; and' mid surrounding darkness blaze!” — — “Odo; I would that praise were just; but here, “A monitor within this beating breast; “The pang of soft regret; the melting tear; “Shades of past pleasures, that allow no rest; “Resolves, that yield to Beauty's dire caprice; “Angers, that if the sigh but tremble, cease; “How speak these signs, my Odo? do they tell “A hero's qualities within me dwell?” — “Albert, my Prince! forgive the bold emprize, “Which would withdraw the film, that blinds thine eyes! “It is not for weak woman's empty wiles “To cast their vapours on a soul of fire: “Call forth the buried flame, that burns within; “Throw off in wantonness, in scorn, or ire, “The interposing cloud, that dims thy day: “Come forth arrayed in majesty, or smiles, “Or indignation; and thy power shall win “The conquest, where thy worship stamps the sway “Of those whom Heaven created to obey!” “But is it not in woman's power to blight “The name of fairest lustre; and to spread “Contempt upon the tarnish'd brow, whence, bright “From honour's flowers, and taintless, should be shed “The wreaths of glory round the hero's heard?” “O Albert, trouble not thy noble heart “With the light follies of a woman's brain! “Leave it to boys to play the lover's part: “Woman's a bauble, wanton, fickle, vain; “Toy for an hour; to be cast off again; “Nor let a trace of her past smiles remain!” — “Are these thy lessons, Odo? is there naught “Of hope in woman's faith? or if it yield “Like wax before the furnace, are we taught, “By pity for a strengthless bauble wrought, “To bear dishonour to the world reveal'd; — “Erase it from the cells of troubled thought; “And to resentment's springing darts be steel'd? “Not so, great Prince! Forbid it Heaven, that Love “Should never constant to its duty prove! “I do not say, that if the crime betrays “Unusual baseness, such as tales unfold “Of wanton Queens perchance in days of old, “Who, when their Sovereigns thus have deign'd to raise “Their meaner sex e'en to the very throne, “Forgetful how their giddy height has grown, “The hand that raised them, and the voice that led, “Wither with perfidy, and blast with scorn; “In the vile dust the sceptre's honours tread; “And pluck the diamonds, that the Crown adorn; “I do not say, that, if the crime be rare, “Justice should then her sígnal vengeance spare!” “Odo, methinks, that were a Queen so base “To nurse licentious passions, it would ask “Arts seldom found, the secret guilt to hide: “And where are they, would take the dangerous task, “To throw a veil upon the varied trace, “When a full Court's quick eyes the search divide? “Perchance, great Albert, he who tracks the guile, “Dare not the secret he has learn'd disclose! “He would not poison the confiding smile; “He would not plunge the trusting heart in woes!” “Odo, the wretch, who thus the wrong conceals, “Becomes himself the partner of the guilt! “Accursed be he, who knows, but not reveals! “May his own blood, instead of hers, be spilt!” Now Odo seem'd in every limb to shake; His colour to grow pale; his heart to quake: — He seem'd, as if he strove the pause to break; But that his failing lips refused to speak. Albert began th'infectious fear to draw; And as with wonder and amaze he saw Some direful mystery in Odo's soul, He scarce his wild impatience could controul. “O cruel Odo, this suspence is worse “Than the most deathlike tale thou canst impart! “Thou canst not throw a more terrific curse “On Albert's soul, than thy suspicions dart! “Speak: or this sword shall bare the secret, prest “Within that guilty and relentless breast!” “My Sovereign, never yet had humble friend “A conflict so disastrous, as is mine; “Howe'er I act; (and fain I would divine “The path of duty,) still I must offend, — “Ah! e'en to death offend, — and endless woe! — “O whither lead these pangs that tear me so? “How shall I frame my words, to let thee know “The dread ineffable unimaged deed? “Canst thou not spare me? can thy fancy's fright “To the dread secret yet unspoken lead? “Where once the day-beam shone, the blackest night “To all thy loveliest prospects must succeed!” — — “O my brain maddens, Odo? I would hear — “But yet refrain! my thronging thoughts declare “A tale too big with horror! — It is past! “Odo, my sun is set; my fate is cast!” — “When ill approaches in its full career, “Whose gathering motion power and strength in vain “Would strive to check, perchance more just the fear, “Than when the worst is done; a deep rebound “E'en from the fullness of its force is found; “And from destruction's blow Hope springs again! “Odo, thou dread'st to tell, as I to learn! “Is Bertha faithless? I am now prepared “To hear the fiend-like story! Do not turn “Away those eyes of horror! Thou hast spared “The death-like truth too long! What silent still! “Then silence tells the deepest earthly ill, “Could blast my fame and fate!” He spoke no more: But shriek'd; and lifeless fell upon the floor. An hour revived him. “Odo,” now he cried, “The deed of horror must be told. Proceed!” The words still seem'd on Odo's lips to hang; And utterance seem'd to fail, while maddening ire From Albert's eyes in furious flashes sprang; And madness rose upon suspicion's fire. Then he grew calm: and while with pity mute The fiend-like Odo dress'd his cunning face, He let the jealous pang take deeper root; And in the heart's last cells had power to trace The red-flamed characters of his own Hell, Which the Muse shudders, while she strives, to tell! END OF CANTO II. CANTO III. Thus Odo paused: upon his cloudy brow Sat the deep thought of the exploding storm; While tears began down Albert's cheeks to flow; And helpless Grief dissolved his vigorous form. Then in low tone, and with a faithless sigh, The seeming friend essay'd the plot to try. “Thou art prepared for woe, my Prince! and now “Fancy and Fear have done their worst, my tale “No more will o'er thy fortitude prevail! “Sovereigns have duties higher than the ties, “Which link them to false female flatteries! “Throw by the wanton flower, e'en tho 'it glows “With every radiant tint, if in its breast “Perverse a store of hidden evil grows, “And blights the sweets, perfidious charms attest!” “Odo, no mysteries!” the Prince exclaim'd: “The speechless deed must yet be told! My sword, “If yet thou hesitate, shall rip the word “From thy doom-telling tongue! It shall be named! — “If Bertha has been faithless, do not spare “That sound, so sacred once!” (A trembling tear Made the name faulter:) “yes, too well I know, “In Bertha's fall will end this tale of woe!” And then his lips convulsed; his flaming eye Sunk in the clouds of black despair; his breath Struggled within him; and impending Death Strove to draw out his last expiring sigh. But the big spirit rose again; and threw The tyrant of destruction from his prey: Then Odo spake: “My Sovereign, I obey! “Alas! my Sire; thy presages are true! “Ungrateful Bertha is less good, I fear; “Less worthy of her Lord, than she is fair!” “False, say'st thou, Odo, — not in thought alone?” Thus Albert stopp'd the wretch, while yet a ray Of faint hope darted thro 'his stormy heart: “My Lord, I make no comments! I would say “Less than the truth; if thus I could impart “That which exacts hard duty to a throne! “Bertha! — (alas, my hapless tongue will fail “To tell the horrors of the unrival'd tale; —) “Bertha holds converse in her secret bowers “With one in deep disguise, whose manly form “And fair-proportioned limbs might rival yours; — “And listeners say, their language breathes of warm “And fond affection: nay, my Lord, be still, “While yet the dreadful duty I fulfill: — “Lock'd in each other's arms, the witness swears, “They bade farewell. with kisses, and with tears!” Leap'd from the Monarch's sheath the flaming sword; Wild thro' the palace Courts he ran; and cried For Bertha; “where is Bertha?” but the word, Uttered in shrieks of madness, quickly spread Horror around; and Bertha, on whose head Love, reverence, gratitude, protection shed, Each faithful menial eager ran to hide: — For all perceived the monarch's maniac mind; But knew not yet the cause! “What ails my Lord?” Said breathless Bertha! “Was that sword design'd For Bertha's bosom? What has Bertha done, “Her Lord to anger? Has vile Odo won “At last his poison'd ear? A fate so sad “Too soon may turn the soundest brain to mad! “But let me seek him still! I will not fly, “Like guilt; but run to meet his reddening eye; “And fall before his feet; or kiss away, “And turn to smiles, his anger's burning ray! “Sure I could calm the fury of his brain! “For I was wont with power uncheck'd to reign “O'er all the movements of his heart; and still “The wildest wave that, in that sacred spring, “Rose to disturb our bliss; and I could fling “Flowers of enchantment, that with magic thrill “Could turn all grief to joy; and every cloud “Could pierce with radiance; and the tempest loud “Could change to notes of softest harmony! “And is it gone? all this delirious power “Gone, gone at once? What is the nameless deed, “A vengeance so severe is sent to try? “What crime of horror, in what evil hour, “Has been to hapless Bertha's charge decreed?” She darted forward: hands, and screams, and prayers Held back her struggling steps: “O stay, yet stay; “Fond, lovely, dreaming Princess! we obey “All other orders: — if thine anger tears “To dust those arms which hold thee, we will cling “Still to that tender form, which not the blow “Of fury to the door of death shall bring, “While these adoring trembling hands can throw “The shield of safety o'er thy precious life! —” —“Am I condemn'd to death? and who condemns? “Condemn'd without a charge; without a note; — “A hint I have done wrong? I know no ill! “Though nought is perfect — (there are specks in gems;) “My conscience owns no passing wicked will: — “And for ill deeds, there is no stain or spot “Upon the milk-white passage of my days!” “O loveliest ruler of our hearts, whose praise “Words weak as ours can never duly raise, “How canst thou deem thine innocence a shield, “When Madness starts, the sword of death to wield?” “Mad! then indeed is Albert's reason fled? “Ah thus comes madness! to one guilty mind “Must be the' iufliction of this woe assign'd! “And yet the lights, that shone round Albert's head, “Methought, too strong, to see that reason dead! “Ah, the storm nearer comes! how loud he speaks! “Walls echo Bertha's name! — he roars — he shrieks! “Save me, my friends! within the deepest walls “Shelter your Bertha's fainting frame: no more “Can she endure to hear her Monarch's calls!” Exhausted eyes that saw not; faultering feet, That kept no hold on the deceitful floor; Arms that still waved the wandering sword, to meet Some visionary form that mock'd the sight; The Prince at length, as in the pangs of Death, Sunk; feebly moved his intermitted breath, As at each gasp 'twould take its final flight. Courtiers stood wondring round; while Odo, sole Skill'd in its cause, his unopposed controul Held o'er the rest: with looks of seeming woe He gazed upon his Master's pallid face; And as the tears around began to flow, Seem'd all the tribe in weeping to surpass: — To the still chamber of his nightly rest The senseless frame was borne; to deep repose By Odo's mandate that unconscious mind, Reckless of her who ruled so long his breast; Of her, who lately caused his speechless woes! Reckless of Bertha's watchings, was consign'd! Stunn'd, weeping, wondering, stupified with grief, In a lone chamber, faint, o'ercome with fear, Almost too feeble to intreat relief, Lay Bertha, stretch'd upon a cheerless bed! Her former fond attendants all were fled; She heard no sound but of a clinking spear, Or guard's low, regular, repeated tread! Or ere perchance the distant passage door Turn'd on its rusty hinges, the sad sound Of iron key with echoing creek went round; And then recurr'd the same sad sound once more, With care the bolt of iron to restore! Half senseless, yet the dismal tone awoke Her frighten'd faculties; and thus she spoke; But spoke to hard unhearing walls — “What tone “Is that, as of a prison? Iron bar; “And massy hinge; and the revolving jar “Of doors forever closing! and alone! — “Without an eye to soothe; or voice to cheer; “All the swarms gone, to whom I once was dear! “My brain is dizzy! woe succeeds to woe; — “Fear follows fear; and blow comes out on blow! “I cannot guess my destiny; I know “No traces of this dismal cell: — but pray “That Heaven would take me to the harbouring grave; “For earth has nothing now, that can repay “The torments I have braved, and still have here to brave!” The gloomy light from her bewilder'd eyes Again was shrouded; and with feeble sighs On her hard pallet she reposed again In calm insensibility; the noise Of creaking door no longer on her ear Strikes; and malignant Fancy works in vain, While those dire images the fiend employs, Perch'd on the sounds the sufferer wont to hear! Alas that ear had heard too true! the sound Was the dread prison bolt; and close around Tramp'd the fell guard with lynx's eye, to close All exit to the wretched Bertha's woes! Odo had done the deed: by Odo's hand In characters of blood the dread command Was traced, that bade the Captain of the Tower Hold the poor victim strait, till came the hour, When Trial due from Treason's charge night free, Or to the fate, which crime deserves, decree! Twas Odo's hand; but in the Monarch's name: For now the Prince resumed an outward calm: Tho' deep within was seen the working flame; And vain were Odo's wiles to pour a balm Into his bleeding bosom! — Hurried look, That not a glance of Courtier's gaze would brook; And incoherent word, and shifting thought, Betray'd the trouble in his bosom wrought! A council held, in order due was told The damning proof of Bertha's guilt: the tale Alas! too clear and full of force, controul'd Each willing doubt, in spite of love's avail; And pity's sceptic scruples! Odo wore A face of tears; a voice of tender moan; While the dread story he began disclose. “You know, my Lords,” he said, “you know I bore “To that fall'n Princess, to whose lovely throne “All eyes and hearts in adoration rose, “Awe, wonder, soul-esteem, above the rest! “Then think with what a withering woe I heard “The secret of her speechless crime preferr'd! “And then how stern, and rigidly, I prest “The proof, that must so vile a deed attest! “Still as each proof came clearer, to my breast “The pang of torment ran with fiercer flame; “Till I began to doubt if Heaven's own light “Was not delusion; and all Virtue's name “Fair to deceive, and mischievously bright! “The soft-eyed, sweet-tongued, tender-hearted Dame, “Bertha, whose lore was wisdom; in whose course “Of days no act, but what an Angel's smile “Might sanction, seem'd to pass: in whom no guile “Censure itself could trace; whom not by force, “But Nature's prompting, Goodness seem'd to guide, “E'en Bertha false and wanton! How is pride “Of mortal essence sunk! And woman's star “How lost in darkness, to revive no more! — Yet worse! it shrouds the beams from Glory's car, “That naught but Heaven's own justice can restore!” He spake — and veil'd his face; and downward bow'd, As if his task his strength had overplied; And woe had conquer'd him! The Council vow'd That justice to their Prince was due; but tried Still with faint hope some lurking doubt to draw From the strange tale: for there is yet a pure And simple radiance in true Virtue's mien, That makes th'admiring eye of wisdom sure; While in the gem not genuine peeps a flaw, By the stern eye of penetration seen! “And what but purity in Bertha's face; “And Bertha's form; and Bertha's words and deeds! “Speak, my good Lords; — e'en tho' the bosom bleeds, “That speaks the wonder, did ye ever trace “Aught but angelic in sad Bertha's life?” “No, my Lords, no!” united all exclaim; “In every act, in every courtly strife, “Gay, solemn; pleasure, business; still the same, “An angel's mind an angel's form inspired!” Odo scarce heard; or scarcely seem'd to hear; But yet some swelling thought his bosom fired; For up his head he half began to rear; Then down it sank upon his arm; and loud A deep sigh issued from his bosom proud. “Enough, my Lords!” he cried, “another day “We meet in calmer mood; and then be mine, “The painful task some measure to divine, “Our monarch's rights to save; and to repay “An injured Prince, howe'er severe the pain, “For the mild bounties of his virtuous reign!” Now Bertha in her lone apartment mourn'd; As the wild tumult in her bosom ceased, Each sad surmise within her thoughts she turn'd;— But vain! no hope her sinking heart appeased. No friend approach'd: the jarring portal still Creak'd on its hinges: and the sound ran chill To her appalled soul, of tread of guard, That paced without, while every window barr'd Said, “Bertha, thou art charged with crime of state, “That holds thy wretched life in close debate!” But the door open'd, and at length relief Appear'd to enter: 'twas a female form, Of look to Bertha strange; but yet it wore A face of pity. “Lonely Lady, Grief “Suits ill with solitude; and doubt's alarm “Kind converse may perchance to peace restore!” Bertha look'd up: a bursting tear o'erveil'd Those eyes, whose dazzling brilliance lately paled All other stars; and rising sighs supprest That tender tougue, whose eloquence on wings Of soft delight was wont to bear away The listening hearer's spirit — “Canst thou say,” At length in broken words she spoke, “whence springs “This doom of darkness, that the wretch befalls, “Whom now thou visitest? What mean these walls “Lone, iron-barr'd, spear-guarded? Is the cell, “To which a Queen is cast, e'en unarraign'd, “Unheard, uncharged, the dismal spot, where chain'd “The fierce-fang'd murderer dies beneath the fell “Arm of vindictive Justice? Thou art pale; “Thy lips all quiver! — Own the unequal'd tale! “End this suspence; and I can bear the worst! “Attests my conscience, I ne'er did an ill; “But I can deem that it may be Heaven's will, “That innocence itself may be accurst “To mortal woes, and ignominious death: “And in the realms of bliss we shall regain “Full recompence for all our carthly pain! “Speak then! is this Death's signal? Is the breath “I drew in palaces, within this den “To close in ignominy; and the fame “A flattering world yet deem'd without a taint, “To go out blasted in the eyes of men? “Say! tell my doom! — I die without complaint!” “Fair Princess! and who looks upon that face, “Can only goodness in its radiance trace, — “Thou may'st take comfort yet! The spot, which stains, “Sure there are dewy herbs that wash away, “If from without it comes; — but the deep dye “That rises from the soul, not all the pains, “And all the washes of earth's wealth obey! — “Wash, rub, purge, purify; all arts apply; “Yet the stain grows; — redder and redder still “Against all labour flames the rooted ill!” “Thou talk'st in mysteries! O do not toy “With human misery; plain words employ; “Tell me the guilt I'm charged with; let me know “The name of him who dares to plot my woe! “And if his wicked soul be too supreme “For me to cope with, let me steel my soul “To meet the fate, that Heaven shall have decreed! “I know Heaven's ways are various! In a dream; “(And in a dream the spells sometimes unroll, “Traced by an Angel's hand, — ) I lately read, “That 'twas my doom upon the block to bleed, “For that which never pass'd my very thought! “And then a Chief in radiant stars appear'd; “And much he seem'd to weep; and much he sought “The mien of deep reluctance, while his tongue “Told the dread tale, that Bertha's lips were heard “To breathe unholy love; and Bertha hung “Enamour'd on a vile adulterer's breast! “And then a broad flash came; and I beheld, “Th' Accuser was in Odo's features dress'd! “I look'd again — the frowning Shade repel'd “My curious gaze; and then I trembling woke!” “Fair Princess, 'twas indeed an idle dream, “By which ill Spirits thy sad slumbers broke!” “Twas but to wrest from thee the friends they deem “Most thy protectors, that these airy Shapes, “Whose active zeal the guardian care escapes “Of watchful angels, sought thy troubled brain, “While bow'd beneath misfortune grief and pain! “To Odo thou must trust! On Odo's power “Thy hope of safety rests; in Odo's love, (“Ah, reverential love, and loyalty,) “Against the gathering waves that would devour, “Thou must owe all, that comes not from above; “All good, which earth's fond scenes may yet supply!” “Lady! if thou thyself dost not belong “To those ill Spirits, who possess the spell, “In the false form of fair humanity “To cloathe themselves, that they may mix among “The scenes of human life; and masked dwell “With mortals to delude, and to mislead, — “Talk not of Odo thus: I know his wiles; “And it has been my lot for years to heed “His treacherous purposes, tho' cloathed in smiles! “Go back to Odo! tell him I can pierce “His deepest schemes; and though he look as fierce, “Where guile is useless, as the tyger's eye, “When roused by rage and hunger on his prey “He darts his ravenous fangs, my destiny “No more shall in his falsehood trust obey! “If I shall fall before his power, I fall “Unblinded, undeceived; with head, heart, eyes, “All open; never, never more disguise “Avails to Bertha! in the Royal Hall “His arts may yet deception work!

CANTO IV. Awe, wonder, fear, suspicion, murmurs low, Pale-faced, half-utter'd guesses, withering gloom, And brooding discontent, and helpless woe, Seem'd waiting for some dread unspoken doom. Above, around; upon the palace-towers; Thro' all its Courts; thro' all its halls, and bowers, Where Joy was wont to reign; and splendid show Its radiance to the sunny bosom throw, Now Darkness, as with the funereal pall Of Death eternal seem'd to sit o'er all! The Monarch mute, with fix'd, unheeding eye, Look'd as on some deep inward purpose bent, Whence nought without should draw him to relent: As if his daring aim was still to try To what dire cruelty, beyond controul Of human influence, he could steel his soul! — As if to say, “no more in human kind “I will believe that there is good or truth! “Fair looks no more must cheat a Monarch's mind; “Nor mercy be, where treason reigns, nor ruth!” In outward semblance Odo wore the hues Congenial to the sorrows reigning round; Upon the ruling grief he seem'd to muse; And even with the mourner's voice was found To mix his sighs; and to the mourner's tears To add soft pity and mysterious fears! On Bertha's name he lavish'd all the glow Of eloquence impassion'd; spoke with awe Of her resplendent charms; and with a flow Of melting sympathy essay'd to draw Her hapless fate! — “Ah; human weakness!” said The deep perfidious man; “if Bertha's heart “Could not prevail against the spells, that, spread “In mortal paths, their poisonous lures impart “To tempt from truth and heavenly rectitude, “Then what is virtue? who was ever good? “But let us think! the very charms that seem'd “A gift of heaven; that sweet enchanting tongue; “That magic lore, on which admirers hung; “Those sentiments angelic, that were deem'd “As of celestial breath, perhaps were all “The very lures that made the angel fall! “Delicious joy upon those charms to gaze “Perhaps the lover's daring flame inspired; “And Bertha's self might perish in the blaze “Resistless, which her very virtues fired!” The long days linger'd on; and yet more sad, When Night had in her sable mantle clad The doleful prison walls; each tedious hour Seem'd as if that chill hideous pierceless gloom Was fix'd for ever: minutes were as days:— Yet e'en the pitchy darkness had no power To hide the infernal sprites, that thro' the room To her mock'd view their frightful shapes would raise! When wish'd Morn came; tho' it in glimmering light Alone broke thro' th' opposing bars, she bless'd Its doubtful dim relief; and cheer'd her sight With the dun yielding texture, which the ray, Dividing, into twinkling atoms press'd. And now a radiance shot upon her brain, And Bertha's mighty soul return'd again. She threw bewildering helpless fear away; And bade her heart a heroine's thoughts obey! A note soon reach'd her on affairs of state; That one of trust with humble duty pray'd A conference, importing much the fate Of her, his Queen adored, to hold: and said, That comfort would attend the granted suit; And much it would behove, with candid ear The voice, that sought her happiness, to hear; And hopeless was the lot of Bertha mute! Denial vain, the suffering captive still'd Wandring conjecture, which had only fill'd Her heart with useless fears, and weaken'd more The calm that all her efforts would restore.— A hurry in the Courts; and shoulder'd arms, And rattling swords, and up the circling tower A tread of footsteps, came with chill alarms On Bertha's listening ear: her bosom beat; And death had welcome been, when no retreat Beyond th' intruding visitor was found! — Once more the bolt drew back; and ring of shields, And rest of halberts, gave the shivering sound Of one, at whose red crimes stern Justice wields Her iron-pointed guard! — Obeisance low, And lofty plume waved to the dingy floor, Announce Count Odo's presence: Bertha starts Back to the dismal cell's remotest bound; Trembling she hides her face: upon her brow Hang the pale drops of death: and o'er and o'er She cries, “Avaunt! thy fiend-like presence darts “Pangs to my heart, and horror to my soul!” — — “Bertha, but hear me! thou must yet controul “Those furies of injustice to thy friend! “He comes to whisper comfort; and to lend “To sorrow's deep infliction Pity's balm!”— A flood of tears descended Bertha's cheek; She dropp'd upon her humble chair; and calm Began to still her tumults — “Thou mayst speak, “Fair Princess! all is safe within this breast: “Ah, — safe as if e'en in thine own it rest!” — — “Count Odo, I have not a Wish, a thought, “But all the world may know! and therefore thee “I would have told whatever thou had'st sought, “Without this rude unceremonious call; “As if I had within this tortured breast “Thoughts only fit to trust a prison wall, “In its dark depths impenetrably prest. — “One only witness; he, of men the flower, “Whose faith not mortal turpitude could doubt, “Whose love sincere, whose generous friéndship, stout “Against all human trials, earthly power “Could ne'er corrupt; nor selfish Passion lead “To wrong another; or to do a deed, “That Angels might not write in types of gold!” “It is not mockery, Princess, (that in clouds, “Whose darkness e'en an Angel's shape enshrouds,) “Becomes that aweful hour, which would unfold “The means to wipe the blackening stains away, “Of those who seek to win immortal day!” — “Where is my Prince; my consort? At his knees, “I never, never laid a prayer in vain!” “Ah! charming Bertha! thou, I know, couldst please; “And there with most supreme dominion reign! “But didst thou never wanton with thy power? “Hast thou not braved it in an evil hour?” — “Never, Count Odo! if the bliss was mine “To rule that great and generous bosom, still “Not once, Heaven witness, did I turn to ill “The precious gift! And say can it be thine, “At that dread altar, where the truth alone “E'en wickedness must speak; before that throne “Can it be thine, the same pure worth to plead? “Hast thou an heart? that trembling hand lay there; “And thus, as thou salvation hopest, swear!” “Fair Princess! in an hour of utmost need, “I came to soothe, to counsel, nay to save! “I did not come to be accused by thee! “But thou hast turn'd th'accuser; thou dost crave “To put me on my trial! not to me “Belong the taunts, thy tongue's ungenerous rage “Throws on a name, which never shall the page “Of History stain; which, spite of cruel wrong, “Shall pay the justice which thy beauties claim; “The love, and faith, which to those charms belong; “And if thou dost not mar that once-bright fame “By rash resentment, and by froward pride, “Will dissipate those clouds, and dash those foes “To atoms, which surround thee now; and raise “Thy car again in glory's track to ride; “And for those hours now gloom'd in deepest woes, “All glad and radiant make thy future days!” Amazement sat on Bertha's looks: a veil Of misty vapour rose upon her sight: Her colour went and came; her wandering thought Caught not in Odo's words a speck of light.— It was some ominous deep-poison'd tale; — Some art of Hell, that her destruction sought! Her tears flow'd fast; her lilly hand was held To hide the gathering tumult of her face: Odo uncheck'd upon the magic grace Of that bewitching form with tremulous gaze Fix'd his unhallow'd eyes: his heart rebell'd; And his ire melted in the dangerous blaze! “Wipe off those tears! withdraw the hand, that shrouds “That angel face; and pour the griefs, that swell “That bursting heart with overwhelming clouds, “Into the breast of thy devoted slave! “O cruel Bertha, thou the tale mayst tell; “And Odo, true, tho' slander'd, yet shall save!” The Princess redden'd: thro her frame there ran A wild despairing force; and she began: “What means this tale, that thy presumptuous words “For ever dwell upon? In Heaven's records “No deed of darkness is inscribed to me! “Thou know'st already all that I can tell: “Then why unceasing on this mystery dwell? “If charges false, it is the Fate's decree, “Should fall upon my head, then boldly say “Th'imputed crime, that I in open day “May meet th'accuser; and due vengeance claim “For him who slanders injured Bertha's name!” “Princess, in whose fair words and ruling eyes “Dwells magic! mortal weakness must oppose “With faint and trembling hope, the pleading tongue “That thus can in its own defence arise! “The listener, while thy rapturing language flows, “Listens delirious, as if angels sung! “If there be ought of love idolatrous, “Which ravishes our reason; and in spite “Of holiest vows and prayers, inebriates us, “(For we are human,) it may be forgiven, “At Beauty's gaze to err thro' pure delight; “To sin, and yet not shut the gates of Heaven! “If at some dangerous hour, when all the heart, “Tuned to delicious harmony, would wake “At every passing breeze's frequent sigh, “The magic of some female form should dart “Her radiance on him; if the charm should break “In mien like Bertha on his ravish'd eye; “And if he should in adoration fall, “Sinking before the splendor of her power, “And rashly, madly, on her mercy call; “And she beneath the veil of secret bower, “In one wild moment's overwhelming net, “The past, the present, future should forget; “Angels perchance may pity! Prayer, and time, “And good for evil, may wash out the crime!” “It cannot be wash'd out! Odo, thy tongue “Is full of falsehood: and thou must not wrong “My unstain'd ears with lore like this! the guile “Of the accursed serpent thou puts't on; “But I am not that Eve, who to thy wile “Will be a victim! if thine arts have won “Thy passage upward, where thy Passions led, “And with an earthly glory crown'd thy head, “It still shall fade, in spite of power and state “Where villains prosper, and where fools are great!” “Relentless ill within thy bosom grows, “Mistaken Queen! but Odo's patient love, “Awe of thy charms, and pity for thy woes, “Still combats insults, and will strive to prove “That he can still be generous, just and kind. “If there be yet the youth whose transient joy “Would recompense all danger, and all pain; “If yet delirious transport, lost and blind “To treason and the scaffold, could employ “A passing hour of victory to gain “The prize; which tasted, if it comes no more, “Leaves life a desert, and the death, that waits “The venial crime, but a severe release; “I would his lot were mine; I would deplore “Its ills with rapture mingled, I would cease “To deprecate the pang, that expiates “So sweet an error: — let the sword display “Its waving edge to strike me; I would say, “Avenging weapon, thou may'st strike to day! “For I have lived; and thou mayst take the rest! “In one short hour a life of joy was prest!” Bertha with wild amazement stared; a frown Half wither'd Odo's dauntless front; she rose; And with a waving hand and hollow voice Half-choak'd by terror: “Wicked Serpent, own “Thy mission!” she exclaim'd — “sure Heaven allows “Thee still in human misery to rejoice; “And Satan comes in Odo's form and name, “The world to his dominion to reclaim!” But when there is an hell within, no sound Of human justice can inflict a wound. — There is no conscience to receive the blow; There is no echo, that can make it know The marks that right and wrong divide; and shew The broad-hued tints, whose glaring contrast shines To all the world beside, to mark the lines! Not Bertha's beauty could the flame of ire Hoodwink; or break the softness of the fire, That shot from her enchanting eyes; or tame The lovely magic of her tender frame! — “That anger, lovely Princess, suits thee well! Was this the charm, that won the happier youth, For whom e'en Bertha could forego her truth? For terms of coquetry; and words that tell Severe reproaches; and denial strong, Venus has taught, from days of all our sires, Give double sweetness to the fateful wrong: Add glow to beauty, and but fan the fires! But dost thou think, that he, who knows how wild In the pure Dames, whose looks to common eyes With chaste affection's throes have only smiled, Runs the veil'd flame when caught by love's surprize, Lists to proud vaunts of virtue; or believes The flower, no longer spotless, yet receives One only stain! ye cannot wash away The deed once done; and therefore Women say, “Let us then, even in despair, be gay!” In thought profound sat Bertha: half she heard The strange Satanic pleading; half in fear, And overwhelming tumult, her closed ear Lost the mysterious deep-wove words, preferr'd To blight that mind, which loath'd impurity E'en in dim hints dared never yet to try! “Does he dare breathe his odious love to me?” The mad thought cross'd her brain: “this Odo — he, Abhorr'd of all mankind — the vilest foe, An hapless, injured, Queen could ever know! O fall'n — how fall'n! unequal'd fall; below The depths to which despondence' self could go! And these accursed prison walls, whose shame Brings on the curse of insults worse than death! Degraded less; he had not dared my name Associate thus with his polluted breath! But yet 'tis mystery: spots upon my fame, As things of which the damning proof he holds, He tells with wanton and malignant joy: He speaks of one, to whom my wedded love I have abandon'd: — When the Book unfolds, At that all-dreaded judgement-seat above, The love I pledged, no record will destroy; And in that Book of Life it will be seen, Odo has slander'd his defenceless Queen!” But Bertha spake not: thro' her troubled soul Tumults too big for words in conflict ran: And thus while Odo gazed, again began Thro' his dark heart unhallow'd fires to roll. He rose: while Bertha hid her pallid face, And sighing, sobbing sat, adown her side Her lilly hand hung lifeless; with quick pace He darted to her feet; and thus he tried That hand to his Satanic lips to raise; And with a kiss, that spoke the fire of Hell, He strove to stain that tender hand, that never Pollution's grasp had breathed upon, for ever! But with a lion's heart and eagle eyes She dash'd th'astonished wretch upon the floor. He rose like Satan in recovered might: — And thus he cried — “Now, Bertha, thou must die! “Farewell, infuriate Dame; — we meet no more!” He gave a parting curse; and took his flight. END OF CANTO IV. CANTO V. “Now, Bertha, thou must die!” the fatal tones Hang on mine ear, though many a month of woe, The former Canto was finished towards the close of May, 1822. The present Canto was commenced on 6 Nov. 1822. Slow lingering onward since, has heard my moans: — For scarce the words had parted, when a blow Fell on my heart, which earth cannot restore: A blow deep sinking, to rebound no more! — Then mute became the Lyre; the trembling hand Shrunk from its strings; the genial breeze, that fann'd The flame which struck it, in chill clouds of tears Died; and inspiring Fancy fled my breast. O Thou, who mid the night of wildering Fears, While the raised arm of Malice knew no rest, Thou, Hope heaven-beaming, who wert wont to shine Still in my bosom; in that speechless hour Thou vanishedst; and for thy light divine, Thou didst pronounce, Despair must hence be mine! As if the voice of the Omniscient Power Had spoke my mortal fate; and said from high, “In this terrestial course thou art decreed “To toss in griefs unceasing till thou die; “And each new woe a following woe shall breed!” But yet into the unresisted pit Of black and still Despondence my strong heart Refused to sink for ever; and by fit And mighty efforts I began impart A dawning ray of light, that through my frame Ran cheering! — Kindled then a gentle flame In my half-wither'd limbs; and thro' my veins Circled the gathering glow in purple stains. And now I sieze the lyre, that hung so long Mute; and again I wake the plaintive song. Bertha, thy lovely image, doom'd to death, Too horror-struck to murmur, or to weep, Revives before me. Scarce thy faultering breath The sparks of life can save; — for dread and deep Strike Odo's words portentous on thy heart. — To die! — It is not sad to die! — but die A death of shame! upon the block to lay The guiltless head; and then to feel the dart Of scorn and infamy to mock the sigh; And prayers and tears with insult to repay! A soul of fire; an angel's fortitude Suffices not for this; — though innocence Self-conscious, may repell those insults rude; And though the sting of guilt may aggravate The punishment that waits the dire offence! Faith says, that for the false awards of Man Heaven will restore the truth; and dissipate Amid angelic airs the foul-breath'd tongue Of human Calumny! but who can scan On earth th'erroneous record? And ne'er hung On human lips the parting sigh of Death, But that it whisper'd with the lingering breath, The hope of kind remembrance See Gray's fine stanzas beginning “For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey.”; and the prayer That censure miglt its conscious ashes spare! Death by the severing axe! and yet the blow In its last pang embitter'd by the woe Of shame surviving! Soul of heavenly fire; Endurance, that no earthly dross could shake, Would pale the yet unyielding light, and quake Beneath th'infliction, and desponding break The holy vase, whose flames could bid aspire Upward, to lose amid celestial joy The sounds earth-springing, which would else destroy! Then Bertha sunk in that still deadly calm Of breathless, black Despair, which has no balm. Her stagnant faculties to all around, Without, within, made no response: her eye Stood motionless with vacant glare; no sound Breath'd from her lips; the current seem'd to cease Along her veins; and every lineament Of Death itself was there, except its peace! But, Hatred, canst thou, fiend accurst, relent, When thou hast snuff'd the tainted gale of blood? — The doom-denouncing Court is met. In deep Debate its secret councils held, a flood Of hell-sprung tears, that seem'd his soul to steep In unaffected agony, descend From furious Odo's ever-lying eyes! Quick at his nod the living proofs attend; Each death-designing word is veil'd in sighs. Then seems the proof beyond the force of voice Human to overthrow. A doubt again Mercy and justice urge; but urge in vain. “O hear th'accused, my Lords! You have no choice! “The Prisoner must be heard!” But Odo cried; “O spare the sad delinquent! Spare her tears; “Spare the wild shrieks that virtue fall'n deride! “Spare the mad sense that with Hell's torment hears “In one dread sentence death and endless shame! “The deed is past: the block, the axe, the flame “Must wash it out: it is a mockery “To ask defence, no earthly power can give! “It is not mercy! Let the Princess die: “And spare th'insulting forms, that have the name, “But not the heart, of Justice! — Hers be peace! “The forethought she has not a day to live, “Will but the troubles of her soul increase!” He ended: all was silent: fear and grief Stunn'd every sense but Odo's: the decree Pass'd as if Satan sat the grisly Chief Upon the seat of Judgment. — “Bertha dies “To morrow! Deep within the Castle be “Prepared the solemn implements; and rise “The sable scaffold! Lonely, secret, still, “Be the dread act of retribution done!” A shudder, and a shriek supprest, begun In cold damp trembling impulses to thrill Thro' every vein but Odo's. — Odo mute Heard the death-sentence utter'd. At the root His fierce revenge had struck: and to his heart Did the dire words a joy infernal dart! O thou, who in thine iron-cinctured cell, Sunk in despondence, dost the minutes tell, Deserted, helpless, earth-fall'n Bertha! thee No soothing angel tells thy destiny! Hid is thy coming fate! perchance 'tis hid In mercy! dull, and motionless, and dark Creeps on the heavy hour, that to the last Conducts thine ebbing life! — “That sound! — and hark! “That muffled sound repeated! — it is past! “Ah! — now it beats! — again! — again! — again! “Tis in the little court, these twilight bars “Look dim upon! — again! — O, I must strain “My eyes to trace that dismal sound: — it jars “This massy floor of stone: half underneath “Its beat reverberates: mystic and low “Workmen their notes lugubrious seem to breathe. “What are the forms I catch? Ah, wherefore throw “Upon that lifted stage of wood a pall “Of deep funereal hue, as if to call “Death to his dance of horrors! I can look “No more upon that sight: tho' I could brook “To hear the monarch's summons, if he come “In common guise to close our earthly doom, “And joy to meet him; not with arm of blood “And eye of vengeance, is my soul upraised “His presence to encounter! I have stood “Firm amid earthly conflicts: I have gazed “Undazzled on earth's luxuries: and Death, “Would he but end my woes, were hail'd by me! “But if he set my sun in blood, the breath “Of human shame will human confines flee; “And round my spirit wandering, in a cloud “Mid heaven's empyreal ways its glory shroud! “That sable mantle wider drawn! the pole “Lifts its high pendent sides! my shuddering soul “Shrinks from the dismal scene: — a misty veil “Presses mine eyes: I fall: I faint: I die!” Down on the floor sank Bertha: the dread tale Had open'd to her heart: the piercing sigh Of earth's last wishes trembled thro' her frame; — Then ceased all human consciousness: the flame Expired of mortal hopes and mortal woes. Quick the Guard's ears; and quick th' officious care, That ere th' appointed hour would interpose, (To her sad couch committed,) they would spare Yet a few lingering hours of earth's abode! But still on Bertha pitying Heaven bestow'd The sweet oblivious draught that strew'd the hours, Which intervened, with visionary flowers! A Spirit came; and led her wandering dreams; And then she seem'd to sit by Eden's streams, Ere Sin that garden's lovely haunts had stain'd; While all to harmony and bliss was strain'd; And all was love celestial; and no fears Of human frailty broke upon the joy, (Full in itself; nor mingled yet with tears;) That could the fleeting race of day employ, Nor ever with its ceaseless raptures cloy. “O linger not on earth,” the Spirit said; “Thou art too good for earth! Amid the moils “Of human conflict thy bright wings are spread “Too wide and airy to commit thy toils “In struggling thy etherial force: the dew “Of earthly vapours taints thy pinions: thou “Art form'd to soar to those celestial choirs, “Where round Heaven's throne are struck celestial lyres! “But Heaven would not unsought be won: the fire “Thou must endure; and clap thy burning wings, “When the flame upward to thy bosom springs: “When inwards fierce and quick the torments dart; “And strike the mortal movements of thine heart; “Serene; untrembling; unassailable; “Smiling thou must exclaim;” it is Heaven's will! “Then clap those wings amid the rising blaze; “And reach the region of eternal days!” Th' angelic voice was trembling on her ear; Her pallid frame in sweet delirium breathed; When cross her closed eye the spectre Fear Came shuddering like a Fiend: his form he writhed As if in agony; and on his tongue Died a few words inaudible; below Again the workman's muffled sound beat slow: She started! cross those walls of silence rung That still repeated dismal sound more loud: Then from her couch in wild affright She sprung: Thro the dull iron'd window seem'd a crowd Beneath, (upon a sable stage now grown To form complete,) all whispering as in tears: And then she heard a shriek suppress'd, — a moan Of female horror: then distinct her ears Caught the dire sounds of “Bertha! — cruel fate! “Must Bertha die on perjured proofs?” No more She heard: but sunk insensate on the floor! O blest insensibility! too late, Unhappy virtuous Bertha, to thy heart Th' ineffable decree cannot be told! — Pass a few hours; and be at once unroll'd The scene of horror! or, oh, rather ope Those once-bright eyes no more! be this thy fate! Death has with thee already had his part! Rest, angel rest, no more to wake on earth! Rest, in thy native Heaven to take a second birth! Alas, not yet the pangs of death are past! The pulse beats faint; a dim red tinge again Crosses the pallid cheek; with fear aghast Feebly those eyelids lift their veil: in vain The wandering sight essays to ascertain Objects around her; — still the giddy brain Turns round; and all is mist, and fear, and pain! On the lone couch her dying limbs were laid: Dark was the barr'd apartment; at her feet Stood a sad Female, o'er whose cheek were spread Drops of half-stifled tears; her bosom beat; Inaudibly her faultering lips essay'd T' address the wretched Bertha, whom Despair Now render'd calm; within her lofty soul The heroine's hopes and fears retired: and care Of earth no longer touch'd her; but within Visions of glory thro' her fancy stole; And her blest spirit fled this world of sin. Then Heaven bestow'd th' oblivious balm of sleep, And her sweet slumbers lasted still and deep, Till the first rays of Morn began to peep Thro' the dim iron lattice of her cell. Now all was mute, nor did a whisper tell The tale of horror to the day decreed. But there was music in the air, heard slow Alone by Bertha's ears: it seem'd to plead With voice of Hope at Heaven's all-bounteous throne, Which with excess of light began to glow; And then it rose to a triumphant tone; “Death has no stings for thee,” it said, “but frees “Thy spirit from its dome of mortal woe. “Rise, and exulting meet the dreaded blow, “Rise and with us th' angelic chaplet sieze!” — The castle-clock struck seven; and then a toll Of the Cathedral-Bell thro' every court Ran with an hollow echo; while the roll Of muffled drum announced the dire report Of death-like preparation. “Hark! it calls! “For me that summons,” Bertha cried, “for me; “Angels have told me, tis for me! ye walls, “Be witness, Heaven has warn'd me! I am free! “It is the note of freedom! but the pain “Of a few minutes; and my grief is o'er! “Another toll! — now steps approach my door; “And nearer beats that muffled drum again!” Now the door opens: in funereal pall Two females entering before Bertha fall: Speechless they cling around her trembling knees: But Bertha, taught by Heaven, no speech demands; “I know your call; and bow to Heaven's decrees: “I seek no frail support from earthly hands; “Firm to the scaffold I can go; and smile “Upon that axe which can release this heart “From wrongs which never can its name defile!” One short half hour of preparation left The mournful messengers announced, — “tho' brief, “It is enough for me,” said Bertha; “grief “Can never end too soon: I am bereft “Of every earthly comfort; and I sigh “To be transported, where no cruelty “Nor wrong of Man my' immortal soul can reach: “Where Innocence can refuge find; and Truth “No human perfidy will e'er impeach! “Give me the veil of Death, but not of Buth; “Smoothe these dishevel'd locks; in order place “These ruffled garments, that of woe bespeak; “And wash the tears from this distained cheek; “And let this victim form bear forth the grace “Of the deep calm, that now within me reigns! “Then call the Priest, and let me bend in prayer “To Him, who from his throne of mercy deigns “Protecting wings to those, whom Man can dare “With unrelenting fangs of hate to tear!” The Priest was near at hand: the veil of Death O'er Bertha's once-bright form was thrown; with slow And mournful steps advanced the Holy Man: “Lady, thou know'st of Heaven's decree: we bow, “All mortals, as behoves, to its behests! “Mysterious, Lady, is th' Almighty's plan; “And dark the schemes that rule in human breasts: — “But all is pure above; and no disguise “Will there avail; nor will th' imputed wrong “Weigh down the fated bliss: — thou canst arise “Untouch'd by earth's inflictions, if belong “Th' unspotted heart to Thee: — if free from stain, “Is only known to Him and thee! then wake “To Him in holy truth devotion's strain; “And to his bosom He thy soul will take!” A faint hue in her faded cheek arose; And from her eye a feeble radiance gleam'd: It was the glow of innocence, that beam'd At doubt's rude insult: “Count, O Priest, my woes, “As thick, and e'en as hopeless as thou wilt: “But mid the direful number place not guilt! “If Earth was once my Eden, my late years “Not guilt of mine has made a vale of tears!” “Lady, compose thy spirit; moments fly! “Before this crucifix, which shall redeem “Those faults which flesh is heir to, lowly kneel! “Here place untrembling faith; and thou shalt feel “The calm of Heaven within thee, ere thou die: “Anticipated rays of Heaven will stream “To light thee upward to thy native sky: “And if thou hast been wrong'd, the wrong will fall “Where the guilt lies, and the funereal pall “Withdraw to shew an angel's relics laid “Circled with glory in her mortal bed!” Again the clock! again the mournful Bell Toll'd out a deeper, slower, hollower knell! They knelt: the hurried prayer; the mutter'd tone; Th' attendant's tear convulsed, and stifled groan, Pass'd in a moment; — thrice the dread Bell flung Its double strokes; that thro' the castle rung;— The Victim needed then no other tongue! Forth led she now her guides; she their support; Rather than they supports to her: a start, And moment's shudder, as before her eyes The dread array of Death uprose, her frame Convulsed; and then involuntary cries Ran, deeper as more stifled, thro' the Court; And groans of ire, and murmurs low of shame: But Bertha's soul already was in Heaven: Earth and its frail accompaniments before Her lifted sight were fled; and she could soar Already thither, where to be forgiven, And recompensed for earthly fault and woe, Celestial voices did the pledge bestow! Pale, but yet lovely and serene, her form All eyes beheld with wonder mute, and breath Suspended: — as before a bursting storm There is a frightful stillness, now a pause, E'en as if Nature's self was crost by Death, Arrested every pulse: “To human laws” Then eried a trembling voice, “all earthly deeds, “E'en of great Princes, must submit: thy cause, “O Bertha, (late our Queen, how fallen now!) “The scale of painful Justice has weigh'd down; “And here thou to thy fate art call'd to bow! — “Once faithful thought, now to thy bridal bed “Unfaithful found, not e'en a sacred crown “Can save thy guilt! if thou behold'st with dread That expiating block, a moment's blow “Will end thy suffering; and the God of All, “Who reigns in mercy, will attend thy call!” Bertha stood motionless, as turn'd to stone; With eyes to heaven upraised: clasp'd were her hands; And not a tear would flow: but when a groan Ran round the scaffold, her reviving soul Its fortitude recover'd: — weeping stands Her train around her: from her sable stole Lifting her lily arm, in lowly voice, Tender, yet firm, she cries: “Ye People, hear! “Thou Minister, whom Justice wrong'd employs, “Attend my dying words! — I am as free “From the base stain of this unspoken crime, “Which never yet reach'd my unspotted ear, “As Angels, who in their etherial clime “Live unassail'd by Earth's impurity! “But willingly I die, since now my name “Has, e'en in falsehood, been allied to shame!” “O spare her!” cried a murmuring whisper, “spare! “She sure is guiltless!” — Then the drum beat low, To drown the murmur: “Princess, now prepare “To close thy sorrows;” said a mournful tongue: — Down on her knees the victim sunk: around Her eyes, all tearless, was a fillet bound: — Then came the waving scymitar; and flung Its deadly aim; and with a mighty blow Sever'd that trunkless head, where Heaven had cast Its mental radiance but a moment past! A shriek broke from the Court: the deep Bell toll'd: The muffled drum again its murmur roll'd: And all went home to weep; and curses pray On Odo's blood-stain'd name; and vows to make That his usurp'd perfidious reckless sway All human efforts should conspire to shake! END OF CANTO V. CANTO VI. Albert, consign'd to gloom and to despair, Immured within his darksome chamber lived: He spent his nights in sighs, his days in prayer; And Odo's hand the reins of Power received. All sensual joys, that rank and wealth could gain, Were Odo's passion; e'en till luxury Became from its excess a feverish pain; And crosses he for very change would try. But crosses came too soon: the discontent, Long hid, began to swell: the tempest, fed Within its cave, began to cloud the sky. The Court was into dismal factions rent: Yet whosoe'er each varied Party led, Revenge of Odo was the general cry. Fair Bertha, (mourn'd at first,) each added day Mourn'd with more calm devotion: shrines were raised; And vows address'd, as to a Saint in Heaven; And often, as upon the evening ray The eye of idol-superstition gazed, Some pillowy cloud first brighten'd; then was riven Asunder; and in midst a Shape arose, Like Bertha's, but more fair and brilliant; crown'd With dazzling brightness: then melodious sound Of choirs angelic seem'd to sing around: “Look up! behold the end of human woes, “When virtue bears the stroke of human wrong; “Yet raised aloft by Faith with smiling eye, “Can view the scymitar, that bids her die; “And, hail'd above, ascend to heaven in song!” Thus fed the love for Bertha's name, it grew Till the deep passion spread through all the realm: In whispers now to Albert's ear it flew, E'en where in lonely grief he shunn'd the helm. “Fair Innocence has bled; and blood-stain'd Crime “Reigns in the giddiness of upstart power! “Albert, arise! the sword of vengeance wave! “See Truth unveiling by the hand of Time! “The very Heavens warn Odo of his hour! “Justice may yet be granted to the grave!” The gathering cries swell'd louder: Odo heard. Fear siezed his guilty bosom; and he fled: Proofs were unfolded; and the call preferr'd For retribution: — then afar was spread Thro' Europe's realms by proclamation loud The tale of Bertha by false charge consign'd To ignominious death: — and now, enshrined In Love's and Pity's hearts, fair Bertha's name Lived sacred; and to Bertha prayers were vow'd, Wherever suffering Virtue raised a flame Of emulous glory in the female breast. O Bertha, when at eve hosannahs loud The voice of praise and gratitude attest To Heaven's immortal throne, how swells the prayer By pealing organ lifted, that thy fame Truth to its spotless splendor may repair; And Odo stand to all the world confest Alike destroyer of thy name and life! But Odo lives amid the raging strife Of Fear and Sorrow and Regret and Shame, And visions wild, and torments of the frame! — In what dark cell hides he his endless woe? Sought, but not found; — eluding yet the foe, Watchful with vengeance to pursue his crime, He skulks unknown! But better were the time, When on the scaffold he should expiate The deeds that must for ever mark his fate! For what is death, when with the agonies Of life like his compared? — O mark his cries! — (Fancy still hears them!) — his convulsive sighs; His burning tears; the phantoms that his eyes Still gaze at, yet would shun; — the pointed sword Over his trembling head by a fine hair Suspended; the blood-streaming bosom gored With ghastly wounds; yet destined life to bear! The dread of endless punishment to come; Yet mad with torments of his present doom! All hopeless horror! — and if there be light, Tis of eternal flames to blast his sight! O Albert, are thy torments less? thy Queen, The mistress of thy bosom, from thine arms Torn guiltless, on the scaffold doom'd to die? Haunts she thy slumbers with reproachful mien? Does shuddering Conscience wake Regret's alarms In thy torn soul? and will Contrition's sigh Wipe out thine heart's disease? The Priest is there, To soothe thy pangs, too just, by soothing prayer! List to his voice! In yonder lonely vale He bids thee found an Holy Sisterhood, Whose prayers pour'd out in deepest solitude, From age to age may rise upon the gale From altars dim but with religious light; And plead to Heaven forgiveness of thy wrong In fervent vows and everlasting song! Now rise the sacred piles! beside a stream In solitary woods a smiling beam From Heaven points out the chosen spot; endow'd With fertile lands, in spires and turrets proud, Beneath the workman's hand the Structure grows Quick and stupendous in the umbrageous close; Till, as if glorious of the duty done, Its top, sky-lifted, glitters in the sun! Nor yet was Heaven appeased: with equal haste In prodigality of wealth was placed A neighbouring Dome of Monks: and altars blazed; And morn to eve the pious hymn was raised In intercession to offended Heaven! And far and wide were saintliest Brethren sought, Whose hearts and tongues with truths divine were fraught. Then distant on the wings of Fame was driven The praise of this religion-gifted Train: But most a voice of an unearthly strain In trembling undulation rose above The rest, whene'er the midnight song awoke! In fervent tones of seeming zeal it broke To raptures bathed in tears of holy love! His Brethren listen'd: but with wild amaze Mysterious fear withheld the' half whisper'd praise. From day to day the growing wonder swell'd: Louder and yet more piercing rose the song: Strange was the human vigour that upheld A heart so passionate, a voice so strong! It was a midnight dark: the shrines around, Blazed all the lamps; in mellower deeper tones Breathed out the pealing organ; when a sound Half-struggling, closed the holy songster's life: His quivering lips just held a moment's strife; Then moved no more: within his pallid frame All earthly consciousness had ceased: then fear Struck to the heart, and mourning met the ear. And when the cowl withdrawn, and vestments bare, Display'd the songter's form, a loud exclaim Of horror ran across the choir; and shook Nave, isles, and altars, as a thunderstroke: With eyes half-blinded the sad Brethren gazed Upon those livid lineaments: — amazed, They traced the features so diguised of late! Twas Odo's self with sacrilegious guile Had sought in holy robes to fly his fate; And tainted with his blood-stain'd hands the Pile Raised to appease the victims of his crime; And seek by efforts of effacing time, In purity of heart and truth of tears, The slow redemption of eternal years!— And here th' imperfect strain must close: too long Already has ran on the tedious song; Tho' broken oft, and oft resumed in vain: For Age my hand enfeebles; and the glow Of youthful fancy bids no more the strain In currents of congenial splendor flow. Thou Lyre, companion of my thorny way, From very boyhood, thro' a life of pain, Still sounding while the vulture tore his prey With talons buried deep within my breast, Not yet we part for ever! be at rest A little while; and if my hoary years Are yet prolong'd, we will not part in tears! Or rather never part! the self-same grave Shall hold us both: and when at evening-hour Twilight her mantle o'er the scene shall wave; And fond Remembrance comes to drop a flower Over my mouldering relics; from beneath Thy strings a tender mournful note shall breathe: Then all the visions of the Past again Shall in the Mourner's trembling heart revive; And saved by thee, to shew complaints were vain, My name be cherish'd still, as if alive!
