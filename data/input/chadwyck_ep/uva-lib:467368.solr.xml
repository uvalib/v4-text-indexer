      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I. 1821. ODE TO DR. KITCHENER. Ye Muses nine inspire And stir up my poetic fire; Teach my burning soul to speak With a bubble and a squeak! Of Dr. Kitchener I fain would sing, Till pots, and pans, and mighty kettles ring. O culinary sage! (I do not mean the herb in use, That always goes along with goose) How have I feasted on thy page: “When like a lobster boil'd the morn From black to red began to turn,” Till midnight, when I went to bed, And clapt my tewah-diddle on my head. Who is there cannot tell, Thou leadest a life of living well? “What baron, or squire, or knight of the shire Lives half so well as a holy Fry—er?” In doing well thou must be reckon'd The first,—and Mrs. Fry the second; And twice a Job,—for, in thy fev'rish toils, Thou wast all over roasts—as well as boils. Thou wast indeed no dunce, To treat thy subjects and thyself at once: Many a hungry poet eats His brains like thee, But few there be Could live so long on their receipts. What living soul or sinner Would slight thy invitation to a dinner, Ought with the Danaïdes to dwell, Draw gravy in a cullender, and hear For ever in his ear The pleasant tinkling of thy dinner bell. Immortal Kitchener! thy fame Shall keep itself when Time makes game Of other men's—yea, it shall keep, all weathers, And thou shalt be upheld by thy pen feathers. Yea, by the sauce of Michael Kelly! Thy name shall perish never, But be magnified for ever— —By all whose eyes are bigger than their belly. Yea, till the world is done— —To a turn—and Time puts out the sun, Shall live the endless echo of thy name. But, as for thy more fleshy frame, Ah! Death's carnivorous teeth will tittle Thee out of breath, and eat it for cold victual; But still thy fame shall be among the nations Preserved to the last course of generations. Ah me, my soul is touch'd with sorrow! To think how flesh must pass away— So mutton, that is warm to-day, Is cold, and turn'd to hashes, on the morrow! Farewell! I would say more, but I Have other fish to fry. TO HOPE. Oh! take, young seraph, take thy harp, And play to me so cheerily; For grief is dark, and care is sharp, And life wears on so wearily. Oh! take thy harp! Oh! sing as thou were wont to do, When, all youth's sunny season long, I sat and listen'd to thy song, And yet 'twas ever, ever new, With magic in its heaven-tuned string— The future bliss thy constant theme, Oh! then each little woe took wing Away, like phantoms of a dream; As if each sound That flutter'd round Had floated over Lethe's stream! By all those bright and happy hours We spent in life's sweet eastern bow'rs, Where thou wouldst sit and smile, and show, Ere buds were come, where flowers would grow, And oft anticipate the rise Of life's warm sun that scaled the skies; By many a story of love and glory, And friendships promised oft to me; By all the faith I lent to thee,— Oh! take, young seraph, take thy harp, And play to me so cheerily; For grief is dark, and care is sharp, And life wears on so wearily. Oh! take thy harp! Perchance the strings will sound less clear, That long have lain neglected by In sorrow's misty atmosphere; It ne'er may speak as it has spoken Such joyous notes so brisk and high; But are its golden chords all broken? Are there not some, though weak and low, To play a lullaby to woe? But thou canst sing of love no more, For Celia show'd that dream was vain: And many a fancied bliss is o'er, That comes not e'en in dreams again. Alas! alas! How pleasures pass, And leave thee now no subject, save, The peace and bliss beyond the grave! Then be thy flight among the skies: Take, then, oh! take the skylark's wing, And leave dull earth, and heavenward rise O'er all its tearful clouds, and sing On skylark's wing! Another life-spring there adorns Another youth, without the dread Of cruel care, whose crown of thorns Is here for manhood's aching head. Oh! there are realms of welcome day, A world where tears are wiped away! Then be thy flight among the skies: Take, then, oh! take the skylark's wing, And leave dull earth, and heavenward rise O'er all its tearful clouds, and sing On skylark's wing! THE DEPARTURE OF SUMMER. Summer is gone on swallows' wings, And Earth has buried all her flowers: No more the lark,—the linnet—sings, But Silence sits in faded bowers. There is a shadow on the plain Of Winter ere he comes again,— There is in woods a solemn sound Of hollow warnings whisper'd round, As Echo in her deep recess For once had turn'd a prophetess. Shuddering Autumn stops to list, And breathes his fear in sudden sighs, With clouded face, and hazel eyes That quench themselves, and hide in mist. Yes, Summer's gone like pageant bright; Its glorious days of golden light Are gone—the mimic suns that quiver, Then melt in Time's dark-flowing river. Gone the sweetly-scented breeze That spoke in music to the trees; Gone—for damp and chilly breath, As if fresh blown o'er marble seas, Or newly from the lungs of Death. Gone its virgin roses' blushes, Warm as when Aurora rushes Freshly from the god's embrace, With all her shame upon her face. Old Time hath laid them in the mould; Sure he is blind as well as old, Whose hand relentless never spares Young cheeks so beauty-bright as theirs! Gone are the flame-eyed lovers now From where so blushing-blest they tarried Under the hawthorn's blossom-bough. Gone; for Day and Night are married. All the light of love is fled:— Alas! that negro breasts should hide The lips that were so rosy red, At morning and at even-tide! Delightful Summer! then adieu Till thou shalt visit us anew: But who without regretful sigh Can say, adieu, and see thee fly? Not he that e'er hath felt thy pow'r, His joy expanding like a flow'r, That cometh after rain and snow, Looks up at heaven, and learns to glow:— Not he that fled from Babel-strife To the green sabbath-land of life, To dodge dull Care 'mid cluster'd trees, And cool his forehead in the breeze,— Whose spirit, weary-worn perchance, Shook from its wings a weight of grief, And perch'd upon an aspen leaf, For every breath to make it dance. Farewell!—on wings of sombre stain, That blacken in the last blue skies, Thou fly'st; but thou wilt come again On the gay wings of butterflies. Spring at thy approach will sprout Her new Corinthian beauties out, Leaf-woven homes, where twitter-words Will grow to songs, and eggs to birds; Ambitious buds shall swell to flowers, And April smiles to sunny hours. Bright days shall be, and gentle nights Full of soft breath and echo-lights, As if the god of sun-time kept His eyes half-open while he slept. Roses shall be where roses were, Not shadows, but reality; As if they never perish'd there, But slept in immortality: Nature shall thrill with new delight, And Time's relumined river run Warm as young blood, and dazzling bright, As if its source were in the sun! But say, hath Winter then no charms? Is there no joy, no gladness warms His aged heart? no happy wiles To cheat the hoary one to smiles? Onward he comes—the cruel North Pours his furious whirlwind forth Before him—and we breathe the breath Of famish'd bears that howl to death. Onward he comes from rocks that blanch O'er solid streams that never flow: His tears all ice, his locks all snow, Just crept from some huge avalanche— A thing half-breathing and half-warm, As if one spark began to glow Within some statue's marble form, Or pilgrim stiffen'd in the storm. Oh! will not Mirth's light arrows fail To pierce that frozen coat of mail? Oh! will not joy but strive in vain To light up those glazed eyes again? No! take him in, and blaze the oak, And pour the wine, and warm the ale; His sides shall shake to many a joke, His tongue shall thaw in many a tale, His eyes grow bright, his heart be gay, And even his palsy charm'd away. What heeds he then the boisterous shout Of angry winds that scold without, Like shrewish wives at tavern door? What heeds he then the wild uproar Of billows bursting on the shore? In dashing waves, in howling breeze, There is a music that can charm him; When safe, and shelter'd, and at ease, He hears the storm that cannot harm him. But hark! those shouts! that sudden din Of little hearts that laugh within. Oh! take him where the youngsters play, And he will grow as young as they! They come! they come! each blue-eyed Sport, The Twelfth-Night King and all his court— 'Tis Mirth fresh crown'd with misletoe! Music with her merry fiddles, Joy “on light fantastic toe,” Wit with all his jests and riddles, Singing and dancing as they go. And Love, young Love, among the rest, A welcome—nor unbidden guest. But still for Summer dost thou grieve? Then read our Poets—they shall weave A garden of green fancies still, Where thy wish may rove at will. They have kept for after-treats The essences of summer sweets, And echoes of its songs that wind In endless music through the mind: They have stamp'd in visible traces The “thoughts that breathe,” in words that shine— The flights of soul in sunny places— To greet and company with thine. These shall wing thee on to flow'rs— The past or future, that shall seem All the brighter in thy dream For blowing in such desert hours. The summer never shines so bright As thought-of in a winter's night; And the sweetest loveliest rose Is in the bud before it blows; The dear one of the lover's heart Is painted to his longing eyes, In charms she ne'er can realise— But when she turns again to part. Dream thou then, and bind thy brow With wreath of fancy roses now, And drink of Summer in the cup Where the Muse hath mix'd it up; The “dance, and song, and sun-burnt mirth,” With the warm nectar of the earth: Drink! 'twill glow in every vein, And thou shalt dream the winter through: Then waken to the sun again, And find thy Summer Vision true! 1822. TO A CRITIC. O cruel One! How littel dost thou knowe How manye poetes with Unhappyenesse Thou mayest have slaine; are they beganne to blowe Like to yonge Buddes in theyre firste sappyenesse! Even as Pinkes from littel Pipinges growe Great Poetes yet maye come of singinges smalle, Which, if an hungrede Worme doth gnawe belowe, Fold up theyre strypëd leaves, and dye withalle. Alake, that pleasaunt Flowre must fayde and falle Because a Grubbe hath ete into yts Hede,— That els had growne soe fayre and eke soe talle To-wardes the Heaven, and opened forthe and sprede Its blossomes to the Sunne for Menne to rede In soe brighte hues of Lovelinesse indeede! TO CELIA. Old fictions say that Love hath eyes, Yet sees, unhappy boy! with none; Blind as the night! but fiction lies, For Love doth always see with one. To one our graces all unveil, To one our flaws are all exposed; But when with tenderness we hail, He smiles, and keeps the critic closed. But when he's scorn'd, abused, estranged, He opes the eye of evil ken, And all his angel friends are changed To demons—and are hated then! Yet once it happ'd that, semi-blind, He met thee on a summer day, And took thee for his mother kind, And frown'd as he was push'd away. But still he saw thee shine the same, Though he had oped his evil eye, And found that nothing but her shame Was left to know his mother by! And ever since that morning sun He thinks of thee, and blesses Fate That he can look with both on one Who hath no ugliness to hate. THE SEA OF DEATH. A FRAGMENT. ?Methought I saw Life swiftly treading over endless space; And, at her foot-print, but a bygone pace, The ocean Past, which, with increasing wave, Swallow'd her steps like a pursuing grave. Sad were my thoughts that anchor'd silently On the dead waters of that passionless sea, Unstirr'd by any touch of living breath: Silence hung over it, and drowsy Death, Like a gorged sea-bird, slept with folded wings On crowded carcases—sad passive things That wore the thin grey surface, like a veil Over the calmness of their features pale. And there were spring-faced cherubs that did sleep Like water-lilies on that motionless deep, How beautiful! with bright unruffled hair On sleek unfretted brows, and eyes that were Buried in marble tombs, a pale eclipse! And smile-bedimpled cheeks, and pleasant lips, Meekly apart, as if the soul intense Spake out in dreams of its own innocence: And so they lay in loveliness, and kept The birth-night of their peace, that Life e'en wept With very envy of their happy fronts; For there were neighbour brows scarr'd by the brunts Of strife and sorrowing—where Care had set His crooked autograph, and marr'd the jet Of glossy locks, with hollow eyes forlorn, And lips that curl'd in bitterness and scorn— Wretched,—as they had breathed of this world's pain, And so bequeathed it to the world again, Through the beholder's heart in heavy sighs. So lay they garmented in torpid light, Under the pall of a transparent night, Like solemn apparitions lull'd sublime To everlasting rest,—and with them Time Slept, as he sleeps upon the silent face Of a dark dial in a sunless place. TO AN ABSENTEE. O'er hill, and dale, and distant sea, Through all the miles that stretch between, My thought must fly to rest on thee, And would,—though worlds should intervene. Nay, thou art now so dear, methinks The farther we are forced apart, Affection's firm elastic links But bind thee closer round the heart. For now we sever each from each, I learn what I have lost in thee; Alas, that nothing else could teach How great indeed my love should be! Farewell! I did not know thy worth; But thou art gone, and now 'tis prized: So angels walk'd unknown on earth, But when they flew were recognised! THE STAG-EYED LADY. A MOORISH TALE. Scheherazade immediately began the following story:— Ali Ben Ali (did you never read His wondrous acts that chronicles relate,— How there was one in pity might exceed The sack of Troy?) Magnificent he sate Upon the throne of greatness—great indeed, For those that he had under him were great— The horse he rode on, shod with silver nails, Was a Bashaw—Bashaws have horses' tails. Ali was cruel—a most cruel one! 'Tis rumour'd he had strangled his own mother— Howbeit such deeds of darkness he had done, 'Tis thought he would have slain his elder brother And sister too—but happily that none Did live within harm's length of one another, Else he had sent the Sun in all its blaze To endless night, and shorten'd the Moon's days. Despotic power, that mars a weak man's wit, And makes a bad man—absolutely bad, Made Ali wicked—to a fault:—'tis fit Monarchs should have some check-strings; but he had No curb upon his will—no, not a bit; Wherefore he did not reign well, and full glad His slaves had been to hang him—but they falter'd, And let him live unhang'd—and still unalter'd. Until he got a sage bush of a beard, Wherein an Attic owl might roost—a trail Of bristly hair—that, honour'd and unshear'd, Grew downward like old women and cow's tail: Being a sign of age—some grey appear'd, Mingling with duskier brown its warnings pale; But yet not so poetic as when Time Comes like Jack Frost, and whitens it in rime. Ben Ali took the hint, and much did vex His royal bosom that he had no son, No living child of the more noble sex, To stand in his Morocco shoes—not one To make a negro-pollard—or tread necks When he was gone—doom'd, when his days were done. To leave the very city of his fame Without an Ali to keep up his name. Therefore he chose a lady for his love, Singling from out the herd one stag-eyed dear; So called, because her lustrous eyes, above All eyes, were dark, and timorous, and clear; Then, through his Muftis piously he strove, And drumm'd with proxy-prayers Mohammed's ear, Knowing a boy for certain must come of it, Or else he was not praying to his profit. Beer will grow mothery, and ladies fair Will grow like beer; so did that stag-eyed dame: Ben Ali, hoping for a son and heir, Boyed up his hopes, and even chose a name Of mighty hero that his child should bear; He made so certain ere his chicken came: But oh! all worldly wit is little worth, Nor knoweth what to-morrow will bring forth. To-morrow came, and with to-morrow's sun A little daughter to this world of sins. Miss-fortunes never come alone—so one Brought on another, like a pair of twins: Twins! female twins!—it was enough to stun Their little wits and scare them from their skins, To hear their father stamp, and curse and swear, Pulling his beard because he had no heir. Then strove their stag-eyed mother to calm down This his paternal rage, and thus addrest: “Oh! Most Serene! why dost thou stamp and frown. And box the compass of the royal chest? Ah! thou wilt mar that portly trunk, I own I love to gaze on!—Pr'ythee, thou hadst best Pocket thy fists. Nay, love, if you so thin Your beard, you'll want a wig upon your chin!” But not her words, nor e'en her tears, could slack The quicklime of his rage, that hotter grew: He called his slaves to bring an ample sack Wherein a woman might be poked: a few Dark grimly men felt pity and look'd black At this sad order; but their slaveships knew When any dared demur, his sword so bending Cut off the “head and front of their offending.” For Ali had a sword, much like himself, A crooked blade, guilty of human gore— The trophies it had lopp'd from many an elf Were stuck at his head-quarters by the score— Nor yet in peace he laid it on the shelf, But jested with it, and his wit cut sore; So that (as they of Public Houses speak) He often did his dozen butts a week. Therefore his slaves, with most obedient fears, Came with the sack the lady to enclose; In vain from her stag-eyes “the big round tears Coursed one another down her innocent nose;” In vain her tongue wept sorrow in their ears; Though there were some felt willing to oppose, Yet when their heads came in their heads, that minute, Though 'twas a piteous case, they put her in it. And when the sack was tied, some two or three Of these black undertakers slowly brought her To a kind of Moorish Serpentine; for she Was doom'd to have a winding sheet of water. Then farewell, earth—farewell to the green tree— Farewell, the sun—the moon—each little daughter! She's shot from off the shoulders of a black, Like bag of Wall's-End from a coalman's back. The waters oped, and the wide sack full-fill'd All that the waters oped, as down it fell; Then closed the wave, and then the surface rill'd A ring above her, like a water-knell; A moment more, and all its face was still'd, And not a guilty heave was left to tell That underneath its calm and blue transparence A dame lay drownëd in her sack, like Clarence. But heaven beheld, and awful witness bore, The moon in black eclipse deceased that night, Like Desdemona smother'd by the Moor; The lady's natal star with pale affright Fainted and fell—and what were stars before, Turn'd comets as the tail was brought to light; And all look'd downward on the fatal wave, And made their own reflections on her grave. Next night, a head—a little lady head, Push'd through the waters a most glassy face, With weedy tresses, thrown apart and spread, Comb'd by live ivory, to show the space Of a pale forehead, and two eyes that shed A soft blue mist, breathing a bloomy grace Over their sleepy lids;—and so she raised Her aqualine nose above the stream, and gazed. She oped her lips—lips of a gentle blush, So pale, it seem'd near drownëd to a white,— She oped her lips, and forth there sprang a gush Of music bubbling through the surface light; The leaves are motionless, the breezes hush To listen to the air—and through the night There come these words of a most plaintive ditty, Sobbing as they would break all hearts with pity: THE WATER PERI'S SONG. Farewell, farewell to my mother's own daughter, The child that she wet-nursed is lapp'd in the wave! The Mussel-man coming to fish in this water, Adds a tear to the flood that weeps over her grave. This sack is her coffin, this water's her bier, This greyish Bath cloak is her funeral pall, And, stranger, O stranger! this song that you hear Is her epitaph, elegy, dirges, and all! Farewell, farewell to the child of Al Hassan, My mother's own daughter—the last of her race— She's a corpse, the poor body! and lies in this basin, And sleeps in the water that washes her face. LYCUS THE CENTAUR. FROM AN UNROLLED MANUSCRIPT OF APOLLONIUS CURIUS. THE ARGUMENT. Lycus, detained by Circe in her magical dominion, is beloved by a Water Nymph, who, desiring to render him immortal, has recourse to the Sorceress. Circe gives her an incantation to pronounce, which should turn Lycus into a horse; but the horrible effect of the charm causing her to break off in the midst, he becomes a Centaur. Who hath ever been lured and bound by a spell To wander, fore-damn'd, in that circle of hell Where Witchery works with her will like a god, Works more than the wonders of time at a nod,— At a word,—at a touch,—at a flash of the eye, But each form is a cheat, and each sound is a lie, Things born of a wish—to endure for a thought, Or last for long ages—to vanish to nought, Or put on new semblance? O Jove, I had given The throne of a kingdom to know if that heaven, And the earth and its streams were of Circe, or whether They kept the world's birthday and brighten'd together! For I loved them in terror, and constantly dreaded That the earth where I trod, and the cave where I bedded, The face I might dote on, should live out the lease Of the charm that created, and suddenly cease: And I gave me to slumber, as if from one dream To another—each horrid,—and drank of the stream Like a first taste of blood, lest as water I quaff'd Swift poison, and never should breathe from the draught,— Such drink as her own monarch husband drain'd up When he pledged her, and Fate closed his eyes in the cup. And I pluck'd of the fruit with held breath, and a fear That the branch would start back and scream out in my ear; For once, at my suppering, I pluck'd in the dusk An apple, juice-gushing and fragrant of musk; But by daylight my fingers were crimson'd with gore, And the half-eaten fragment was flesh at the core; And once—only once—for the love of its blush, I broke a bloom bough, but there came such a gush On my hand, that it fainted away in weak fright, While the leaf-hidden woodpecker shriek'd at the sight; And oh! such an agony thrill'd in that note, That my soul, startling up, beat its wings in my throat, As it long'd to be free of a body whose hand Was doom'd to work torments a Fury had plann'd! There I stood without stir, yet how willing to flee, As if rooted and horror-turn'd into a tree,— Oh! for innocent death,—and to suddenly win it, I drank of the stream, but no poison was in it; I plunged in its waters, but ere I could sink, Some invisible fate pull'd me back to the brink; I sprang from the rock, from its pinnacle height, But fell on the grass with a grasshopper's flight; I ran at my fears—they were fears and no more, For the bear would not mangle my limbs, nor the boar, But moan'd—all their brutalised flesh could not smother The horrible truth,—we were kin to each other! They were mournfully gentle, and group'd for relief, All foes in their skin, but all friends in their grief: The leopard was there,—baby-mild in its feature; And the tiger, black-barr'd, with the gaze of a creature That knew gentle pity; the bristle-back'd boar, His innocent tusks stain'd with mulberry gore; And the laughing hyena—but laughing no more; And the snake, not with magical orbs to devise Strange death, but with woman's attraction of eyes; The tall ugly ape, that still bore a dim shine Through his hairy eclipse of a manhood divine; And the elephant stately, with more than its reason, How thoughtful in sadness! but this is no season To reckon them up from the lag-bellied toad To the mammoth, whose sobs shook his ponderous load. There were woes of all shapes, wretched forms, when I came, That hung down their heads with a human-like shame; The elephant hid in the boughs, and the bear Shed over his eyes the dark veil of his hair; And the womanly soul turning sick with disgust, Tried to vomit herself from her serpentine crust; While all groan'd their groans into one at their lot, As I brought them the image of what they were not. Then rose a wild sound of the human voice choking Through vile brutal organs—low tremulous croaking; Cries swallow'd abruptly—deep animal tones Attuned to strange passion, and full-utter'd groans; All shuddering weaker, till hush'd in a pause Of tongues in mute motion and wide-yawning jaws; And I guess'd that those horrors were meant to tell o'er The tale of their woes; but the silence told more, That writhed on their tongues; and I knelt on the sod, And pray'd with my voice to the cloud-stirring god, For the sad congregation of supplicants there, That upturn'd to his heaven brute faces of prayer; And I ceased, and they utter'd a moaning so deep, That I wept for my heart-ease,—but they could not weep, And gazed with red eyeballs, all wistfully dry, At the comfort of tears in a stag's human eye. Then I motion'd them round, and, to soothe their distress, I caress'd, and they bent them to meet my caress, Their necks to my arm, and their heads to my palm, And with poor grateful eyes suffer'd meekly and calm Those tokens of kindness, withheld by hard fate From returns that might chill the warm pity to hate; So they passively bow'd—save the serpent, that leapt To my breast like a sister, and pressingly crept In embrace of my neck, and with close kisses blister'd My lips in rash love,—then drew backward, and glister'd Her eyes in my face, and loud hissing affright, Dropt down, and swift started away from my sight! This sorrow was theirs, but thrice wretched my lot, Turn'd brute in my soul, though my body was not, When I fled from the sorrow of womanly faces, That shrouded their woe in the shade of lone places, And dash'd off bright tears, till their fingers were wet, And then wiped their lids with long tresses of jet: But I fled—though they stretch'd out their hands, all entangled With hair, and blood-stain'd of the breasts they had mangled,— Though they call'd—and perchance but to ask, had I seen Their loves, or to tell the vile wrongs that had been: But I stay'd not to hear, lest the story should hold Some hell-form of words, some enchantment, once told, Might translate me in flesh to a brute; and I dreaded To gaze on their charms, lest my faith should be wedded With some pity,—and love in that pity perchance— To a thing not all lovely; for once at a glance, Methought, where one sat, I descried a bright wonder That flow'd like a long silver rivulet under The long fenny grass,—with so lovely a breast, Could it be a snake-tail made the charm of the rest? So I roam'd in that circle of horrors, and Fear Walk'd with me, by hills, and in valleys, and near Cluster'd trees for their gloom—not to shelter from heat— But lest a brute-shadow should grow at my feet; And besides that full oft in the sunshiny place Dark shadows would gather like clouds on its face, In the horrible likeness of demons (that none Could see, like invisible flames in the sun); But grew to one monster that seized on the light, Like the dragon that strangles the moon in the night; Fierce sphinxes, long serpents, and asps of the south; Wild birds of huge beak, and all horrors that drouth Engenders of slime in the land of the pest, Vile shapes without shape, and foul bats of the West, Bringing Night on their wings; and the bodies wherein Great Brahma imprisons the spirits of sin. Many-handed, that blent in one phantom of fight Like a Titan, and threatfully warr'd with the light; I have heard the wild shriek that gave signal to close, When they rush'd on that shadowy Python of foes, That met with sharp beaks and wide gaping of jaws, With flappings of wings, and fierce grasping of claws, And whirls of long tails:—I have seen the quick flutter Of fragments dissever'd,—and necks stretch'd to utter Long screamings of pain,—the swift motion of blows, And wrestling of arms—to the flight at the close, When the dust of the earth startled upward in rings, And flew on the whirlwind that follow'd their wings. Thus they fled—not forgotten—but often to grow Like fears in my eyes, when I walk'd to and fro In the shadows, and felt from some beings unseen The warm touch of kisses, but clean or unclean I knew not, nor whether the love I had won Was of heaven or hell—till one day in the sun, In its very noon-blaze, I could fancy a thing Of beauty, but faint as the cloud-mirrors fling On the gaze of the shepherd that watches the sky, Half-seen and half-dream'd in the soul of his eye. And when in my musings I gazed on the stream, In motionless trances of thought, there would seem A face like that face, looking upward through mine; With its eyes full of love, and the dim-drownëd shine Of limbs and fair garments, like clouds in that blue Serene:—there I stood for long hours but to view Those fond earnest eyes that were ever uplifted Towards me, and wink'd as the water-weed drifted Between; but the fish knew that presence, and plied Their long curvy tails, and swift darted aside. There I gazed for lost time, and forgot all the things That once had been wonders—the fishes with wings, And the glimmer of magnified eyes that look'd up From the glooms of the bottom like pearls in a cup, And the huge endless serpent of silvery gleam, Slow winding along like a tide in the stream. Some maid of the waters, some Naiad, methought Held me dear in the pearl of her eye—and I brought My wish to that fancy; and often I dash'd My limbs in the water, and suddenly splash'd The cool drops around me, yet clung to the brink, Chill'd by watery fears, how that beauty might sink With my life in her arms to her garden, and bind me With its long tangled grasses, or cruelly wind me In some eddy to hum out my life in her ear, Like a spider-caught bee,—and in aid of that fear Came the tardy remembrance—Oh falsest of men! Why was not that beauty remember'd till then? My love, my safe love, whose glad life would have run Into mine—like a drop—that our fate might be one, That now, even now,—may-be,—clasp'd in a dream, That form which I gave to some jilt of the stream, And gazed with fond eyes that her tears tried to smother On a mock of those eyes that I gave to another! Then I rose from the stream, but the eyes of my mind, Still full of the tempter, kept gazing behind On her crystalline face, while I painfully leapt To the bank, and shook off the curst waters, and wept With my brow in the reeds; and the reeds to my ear Bow'd, bent by no wind, and in whispers of fear, Growing small with large secrets, foretold me of one That loved me,—but oh to fly from her, and shun Her love like a pest—though her love was as true To mine as her stream to the heavenly blue; For why should I love her with love that would bring All misfortune, like hate, on so joyous a thing? Because of her rival,—even Her whose witch-face I had slighted, and therefore was doom'd in that place To roam, and had roam'd, where all horrors grew rank, Nine days ere I wept with my brow on that bank; Her name be not named, but her spite would not fail To our love like a blight; and they told me the tale Of Scylla,—and Picus, imprison'd to speak His shrill-screaming woe through a woodpecker's beak. Then they ceased—I had heard as the voice of my star That told me the truth of my fortunes—thus far I had read of my sorrow, and lay in the hush Of deep meditation,—when lo! a light crush Of the reeds, and I turn'd and look'd round in the night Of new sunshine, and saw, as I sipp'd of the light Narrow-winking, the realised nymph of the stream, Rising up from the wave with the bend and the gleam Of a fountain, and o'er her white arms she kept throwing Bright torrents of hair, that went flowing and flowing In falls to her feet, and the blue waters roll'd Down her limbs like a garment, in many a fold, Sun-spangled, gold-broider'd, and fled far behind, Like an infinite train. So she came and reclined In the reeds, and I hunger'd to see her unseal The buds of her eyes that would ope and reveal The blue that was in them;—they oped and she raised Two orbs of pure crystal, and timidly gazed With her eyes on my eyes; but their colour and shine Was of that which they look'd on, and mostly of mine— For she loved me,—except when she blush'd, and they sank, Shame-humbled, to number the stones on the bank, Or her play-idle fingers, while lisping she told me How she put on her veil, and in love to behold me Would wing through the sun till she fainted away Like a mist, and then flew to her waters and lay In love-patience long hours, and sore dazzled her eyes In watching for mine 'gainst the midsummer skies. But now they were heal'd,—O my heart, it still dances When I think of the charm of her changeable glances, And my image how small when it sank in the deep Of her eyes where her soul was,—Alas! now they weep, And none knoweth where. In what stream do her eyes Shed invisible tears? Who beholds where her sighs Flow in eddies, or sees the ascent of the leaf She has pluck'd with her tresses? Who listens her grief Like a far fall of waters, or hears where her feet Grow emphatic among the loose pebbles, and beat Them together? Ah! surely her flowers float adown To the sea unaccepted, and little ones drown For need of her mercy,—even he whose twin-brother Will miss him for ever; and the sorrowful mother Imploreth in vain for his body to kiss And cling to, all dripping and cold as it is, Because that soft pity is lost in hard pain! We loved,—how we loved!—for I thought not again Of the woes that were whisper'd like fears in that place If I gave me to beauty. Her face was the face Far away, and her eyes were the eyes that were drown'd For my absence,—her arms were the arms that sought round And claspt me to nought; for I gazed and became Only true to my falsehood, and had but one name For two loves, and call'd ever on Ægle, sweet maid Of the sky-loving waters,—and was not afraid Of the sight of her skin;—for it never could be, Her beauty and love were misfortunes to me! Thus our bliss had endured for a time-shorten'd space, Like a day made of three, and the smile of her face Had been with me for joy,—when she told me indeed Her love was self-task'd with a work that would need Some short hours, for in truth 'twas the veriest pity Our love should not last, and then sang me a ditty, Of one with warm lips that should love her, and love her When suns were burnt dim and long ages past over. So she fled with her voice, and I patiently nested My limbs in the reeds, in still quiet, and rested Till my thoughts grew extinct, and I sank in a sleep Of dreams,—but their meaning was hidden too deep To be read what their woe was;—but still it was woe That was writ on all faces that swam to and fro In that river of night;—and the gaze of their eyes Was sad,—and the bend of their brows,—and their cries Were seen, but I heard not. The warm touch of tears Travell'd down my cold cheeks, and I shook till my fears Awaked me, and lo! I was couch'd in a bower, The growth of long summers rear'd up in an hour! Then I said, in the fear of my dream, I will fly From this magic, but could not, because that my eye Grew love-idle among the rich blooms; and the earth Held me down with its coolness of touch, and the mirth Of some bird was above me,—who, even in fear, Would startle the thrush? and methought there drew near A form as of Ægle,—but it was not the face Hope made, and I knew the witch-Queen of that place, Even Circe the Cruel, that came like a Death Which I fear'd, and yet fled not, for want of my breath. There was thought in her face, and her eyes were not raised From the grass at her foot, but I saw, as I gazed, Her spite—and her countenance changed with her mind As she plann'd how to thrall me with beauty, and bind My soul to her charms,—and her long tresses play'd From shade into shine and from shine into shade, Like a day in mid-autumn,—first fair, O how fair! With long snaky locks of the adder-black hair That clung round her neck,—those dark locks that I prize, For the sake of a maid that once loved me with eyes Of that fathomless hue,—but they changed as they roll'd, And brighten'd, and suddenly blazed into gold That she comb'd into flames, and the locks that fell down Turn'd dark as they fell, but I slighted their brown, Nor loved, till I saw the light ringlets shed wild, That innocence wears when she is but a child; And her eyes,—Oh I ne'er had been witch'd with their shine, Had they been any other, my Ægle, than thine! Then I gave me to magic, and gazed till I madden'd In the full of their light,—but I sadden'd and sadden'd The deeper I look'd,—till I sank on the snow Of her bosom, a thing made of terror and woe, And answer'd its throb with the shudder of fears, And hid my cold eyes from her eyes with my tears, And strain'd her white arms with the still languid weight Of a fainting distress. There she sat like the Fate That is nurse unto Death, and bent over in shame To hide me from her—the true Ægle—that came With the words on her lips the false witch had fore-given To make me immortal—for now I was even At the portals of Death, who but waited the hush Of world-sounds in my ear to cry welcome, and rush With my soul to the banks of his black-flowing river. Oh, would it had flown from my body for ever, Ere I listen'd those words, when I felt with a start, The life-blood rush back in one throb to my heart, And saw the pale lips where the rest of that spell Had perish'd in horror—and heard the farewell Of that voice that was drown'd in the dash of the stream! How fain had I follow'd, and plunged with that scream Into death, but my being indignantly lagg'd Through the brutalised flesh that I painfully dragg'd Behind me:—“O Circe! O mother of spite! Speak the last of that curse! and imprison me quite In the husk of a brute,—that no pity may name The man that I was,—that no kindred may claim The monster I am! Let me utterly be Brute-buried, and Nature's dishonour with me Uninscribed!”—But she listen'd my prayer, that was praise To her malice, with smiles, and advised me to gaze On the river for love,—and perchance she would make In pity a maid without eyes for my sake, And she left me like Scorn. Then I ask'd of the wave, What monster I was, and it trembled and gave The true shape of my grief, and I turn'd with my face From all waters for ever, and fled through that place, Till with horror more strong than all magic I pass'd Its bounds, and the world was before me at last. There I wander'd in sorrow, and shunn'd the abodes Of men, that stood up in the likeness of Gods, But I saw from afar the warm shine of the sun On their cities, where man was a million, not one; And I saw the white smoke of their altars ascending, That show'd where the hearts of the many were blending, And the wind in my face brought shrill voices that came From the trumpets that gather'd whole bands in one fame As a chorus of man,—and they stream'd from the gates Like a dusky libation pour'd out to the Fates. But at times there were gentler processions of peace That I watch'd with my soul in my eyes till their cease, There were women! there men! but to me a third sex I saw them all dots—yet I loved them as specks: And oft to assuage a sad yearning of eyes I stole near the city, but stole covert-wise Like a wild beast of love, and perchance to be smitten By some hand that I rather had wept on than bitten! Oh, I once had a haunt near a cot where a mother Daily sat in the shade with her child, and would smother Its eyelids in kisses, and then in its sleep Sang dreams in its ear of its manhood, while deep In a thicket of willows I gazed o'er the brooks That murmur'd between us and kiss'd them with looks; But the willows unbosom'd their secret, and never I return'd to a spot I had startled for ever, Though I oft long'd to know, but could ask it of none, Was the mother still fair, and how big was her son? For the haunters of fields they all shunn'd me by flight, The men in their horror, the women in fright; None ever remain'd save a child once that sported Among the wild bluebells, and playfully courted The breeze; and beside him a speckled snake lay Tight strangled, because it had hiss'd him away From the flower at his finger; he rose and drew near Like a Son of Immortals, one born to no fear, But with strength of black locks and with eyes azure bright To grow to large manhood of merciful might. He came, with his face of bold wonder, to feel, The hair of my side, and to lift up my heel, And question'd my face with wide eyes; but when under My lids he saw tears,—for I wept at his wonder, He stroked me, and utter'd such kindliness then, That the once love of women, the friendship of men In past sorrow, no kindness e'er came like a kiss On my heart in its desolate day such as this! And I yearn'd at his cheeks in my love, and down bent, And lifted him up in my arms with intent To kiss him,—but he cruel-kindly, alas! Held out to my lips a pluck'd handful of grass! Then I dropt him in horror, but felt as I fled The stone he indignantly hurl'd at my head, That dissever'd my ear,—but I felt not, whose fate Was to meet more distress in his love than his hate! Thus I wander'd, companion'd of grief and forlorn Till I wish'd for that land where my being was born, But what was that land with its love, where my home Was self-shut against me; for why should I come Like an after-distress to my grey-bearded father, With a blight to the last of his sight?—let him rather Lament for me dead, and shed tears in the urn Where I was not, and still in fond memory turn To his son even such as he left him. Oh, how Could I walk with the youth once my fellows, but now Like Gods to my humbled estate?—or how bear The steeds once the pride of my eyes and the care Of my hands? Then I turn'd me self-banish'd, and came Into Thessaly here, where I met with the same As myself. I have heard how they met by a stream In games, and were suddenly changed by a scream That made wretches of many, as she roll'd her wild eyes Against heaven, and so vanish'd.—The gentle and wise Lose their thoughts in deep studies, and others their ill In the mirth of mankind where they mingle them still. THE TWO PEACOCKS OF BEDFONT. Alas! That breathing Vanity should go Where Pride is buried,—like its very ghost, Uprisen from the naked bones below, In novel flesh, clad in the silent boast Of gaudy silk that flutters to and fro, Shedding its chilling superstition most On young and ignorant natures—as it wont To haunt the peaceful churchyard of Bedfont! Each Sabbath morning, at the hour of prayer, Behold two maidens, up the quiet green Shining, far distant, in the summer air That flaunts their dewy robes and breathes between Their downy plumes,—sailing as if they were Two far-off ships,—until they brush between The churchyard's humble walls, and watch and wait On either side of the wide open'd gate. And there they stand—with haughty necks before God's holy house, that points towards the skies— Frowning reluctant duty from the poor, And tempting homage from unthoughtful eyes: And Youth looks lingering from the temple door, Breathing its wishes in unfruitful sighs, With pouting lips,—forgetful of the grace, Of health, and smiles, on the heart-conscious face;— Because that Wealth, which has no bliss beside, May wear the happiness of rich attire; And those two sisters, in their silly pride, May change the soul's warm glances for the fire Of lifeless diamonds;—and for health denied,— With art, that blushes at itself, inspire Their languid cheeks—and flourish in a glory That has no life in life, nor after-story. The aged priest goes shaking his grey hair In meekest censuring, and turns his eye Earthward in grief, and heavenward in pray'r, And sighs, and clasps his hands, and passes by, Good-hearted man! what sullen soul would wear Thy sorrow for a garb, and constantly Put on thy censure, that might win the praise Of one so grey in goodness and in days? Also the solemn clerk partakes the shame Of this ungodly shine of human pride, And sadly blends his reverence and blame In one grave bow, and passes with a stride Impatient:—many a red-hooded dame Turns her pain'd head, but not her glance, aside From wanton dress, and marvels o'er again, That heaven hath no wet judgments for the vain. “I have a lily in the bloom at home,” Quoth one, “and by the blessed Sabbath day I'll pluck my lily in its pride, and come And read a lesson upon vain array;— And when stiff silks are rustling up, and some Give place, I'll shake it in proud eyes and say— Making my reverence,—‘Ladies, an you please, King Solomon's not half so fine as these.’” Then her meek partner, who has nearly run His earthly course,—“Nay, Goody, let your text Grow in the garden.—We have only one— Who knows that these dim eyes may see the next? Summer will come again, and summer sun, And lilies too,—but I were sorely vext To mar my garden, and cut short the blow Of the last lily I may live to grow.” “The last!” quoth she, “and though the last it were— Lo! those two wantons, where they stand so proud With waving plumes, and jewels in their hair, And painted cheeks, like Dagons to be bow'd And curtsey'd to!—last Sabbath after pray'r, I heard the little Tomkins ask aloud If they were angels—but I made him know God's bright ones better, with a bitter blow!” So speaking, they pursue the pebbly walk That leads to the white porch the Sunday throng, Hand-coupled urchins in restrainëd talk, And anxious pedagogue that chastens wrong, And posied churchwarden with solemn stalk, And gold-bedizen'd beadle flames along, And gentle peasant clad in buff and green, Like a meek cowslip in the spring serene; And blushing maiden—modestly array'd In spotless white,—still conscious of the glass; And she, the lonely widow, that hath made A sable covenant with grief,—alas! She veils her tears under the deep, deep shade, While the poor kindly-hearted, as they pass, Bend to unclouded childhood, and caress Her boy,—so rosy!—and so fatherless! Thus, as good Christians ought, they all draw near The fair white temple, to the timely call Of pleasant bells that tremble in the ear.— Now the last frock, and scarlet hood, and shawl Fade into dusk, in the dim atmosphere Of the low porch, and heav'n has won them all, —Saving those two, that turn aside and pass, In velvet blossom, where all flesh is grass. Ah me! to see their silken manors trail'd In purple luxuries—with restless gold,— Flaunting the grass where widowhood has wail'd In blotted black,—over the heapy mould Panting wave-wantonly! They never quail'd How the warm vanity abused the cold; Nor saw the solemn faces of the gone Sadly uplooking through transparent stone: But swept their dwellings with unquiet light, Shocking the awful presence of the dead; Where gracious natures would their eyes benight Nor wear their being with a lip too red, Nor move too rudely in the summer bright Of sun, but put staid sorrow in their tread, Meting it into steps, with inward breath, In very pity to bereaved death. Now in the church, time-sober'd minds resign To solemn pray'r, and the loud chaunted hymn,— With glowing picturings of joys divine Painting the mist-light where the roof is dim But youth looks upward to the window shine, Warming with rose and purple and the swim Of gold, as if thought-tinted by the stains Of gorgeous light through many-colour'd panes: Soiling the virgin snow wherein God hath Enrobed his angels,—and with absent eyes Hearing of Heav'n, and its directed path, Thoughtful of slippers,—and the glorious skies Clouding with satin,—till the preacher's wrath Consumes his pity, and he glows, and cries With a deep voice that trembles in its might, And earnest eyes grown eloquent in light: “Oh, that the vacant eye would learn to look On very beauty, and the heart embrace True loveliness, and from this holy book Drink the warm-breathing tenderness and grace Of love indeed! Oh, that the young soul took Its virgin passion from the glorious face Of fair religion, and address'd its strife, To win the riches of eternal life! “Doth the vain heart love glory that is none, And the poor excellence of vain attire? Oh go, and drown your eyes against the sun, The visible ruler of the starry quire, Till boiling gold in giddy eddies run, Dazzling the brain with orbs of living fire; And the faint soul down-darkens into night, And dies a burning martyrdom to light. “Oh go, and gaze,—when the low winds of ev'n Breathe hymns, and Nature's many forests nod Their gold-crown'd heads; and the rich blooms of heav'n Sun-ripen'd give their blushes up to God; And mountain-rocks and cloudy steeps are riv'n By founts of fire, as smitten by the rod Of heavenly Moses,—that your thirsty sense May quench its longings of magnificence! “Yet suns shall perish—stars shall fade away— Day into darkness—darkness into death— Death into silence; the warm light of day, The blooms of summer, the rich glowing breath Of even—all shall wither and decay, Like the frail furniture of dreams beneath The touch of morn—or bubbles of rich dyes That break and vanish in the aching eyes.” They hear, soul-blushing, and repentant shed Unwholesome thoughts in wholesome tears, and pour Their sin to earth,—and with low drooping head Receive the solemn blessing, and implore Its grace—then soberly with chasten'd tread, They meekly press towards the gusty door, With humbled eyes that go to graze upon The lowly grass—like him of Babylon. The lowly grass!—O water-constant mind! Fast-ebbing holiness!—soon-fading grace Of serious thought, as if the gushing wind Through the low porch had wash'd it from the face For ever!—How they lift their eyes to find Old vanities!—Pride wins the very place Of meekness, like a bird, and flutters now With idle wings on the curl-conscious brow! And lo! with eager looks they seek the way Of old temptation at the lowly gate; To feast on feathers, and on vain array, And painted cheeks, and the rich glistering state Of jewel-sprinkled locks.—But where are they, The graceless haughty ones that used to wait With lofty neck, and nods, and stiffen'd eye?— None challenge the old homage bending by. In vain they look for the ungracious bloom Of rich apparel where it glow'd before,— For Vanity has faded all to gloom, And lofty Pride has stiffen'd to the core, For impious Life to tremble at its doom,— Set for a warning token evermore, Whereon, as now, the giddy and the wise Shall gaze with lifted hands and wond'ring eyes. The aged priest goes on each sabbath morn, But shakes not sorrow under his grey hair; The solemn clerk goes lavender'd and shorn Nor stoops his back to the ungodly pair;— And ancient lips that pucker'd up in scorn, Go smoothly breathing to the house of pray'r; And in the garden-plot, from day to day, The lily blooms its long white life away. And where two haughty maidens used to be, In pride of plume, where plumy Death had trod, Trailing their gorgeous velvets wantonly, Most unmeet pall, over the holy sod;— There, gentle stranger, thou may'st only see Two sombre Peacocks.—Age, with sapient nod Marking the spot, still tarries to declare How they once lived, and wherefore they are there. HYMN TO THE SUN. Giver of glowing light! Though but a god of other days, The kings and sages Of wiser ages Still live and gladden in thy genial rays! King of the tuneful lyre, Still poets' hymns to thee belong Though lips are cold Whereon of old Thy beams all turn'd to worshipping and song! Lord of the dreadful bow, None triumph now for Python's death; But thou dost save From hungry grave The life that hangs upon a summer breath. Father of rosy day, No more thy clouds of incense rise; But waking flow'rs At morning hours, Give out their sweets to meet thee in the skies. God of the Delphic fane, No more thou listenest to hymns sublime; But they will leave On winds at eve, A solemn echo to the end of time. MIDNIGHT. Unfathomable Night! how dost thou sweep Over the flooded earth, and darkly hide The mighty city under thy full tide; Making a silent palace for old Sleep, Like his own temple under the hush'd deep, Where all the busy day he doth abide, And forth at the late dark, outspreadeth wide His dusky wings, whence the cold water sweep! How peacefully the living millions lie! Lull'd unto death beneath his poppy spells; There is no breath—no living stir—no cry— No tread of foot—no song—no music-call— Only the sound of melancholy bells— The voice of Time—survivor of them all! TO A SLEEPING CHILD. I. Oh, 'tis a touching thing, to make one weep,— A tender infant with its curtain'd eye, Breathing as it would neither live nor die With that unchanging countenance of sleep! As if its silent dream, serene and deep, Had lined its slumber with a still blue sky So that the passive cheeks unconscious lie With no more life than roses—just to keep The blushes warm, and the mild, odorous breath. O blossom boy! so calm is thy repose, So sweet a compromise of life and death, 'Tis pity those fair buds should e'er unclose For memory to stain their inward leaf, Tinging thy dreams with unacquainted grief. TO A SLEEPING CHILD. II. Thine eyelids slept so beauteously, I deem'd No eyes could wake so beautiful as they: Thy rosy cheeks in such still slumbers lay, I loved their peacefulness, nor ever dream'd Of dimples:—for those parted lips so seem'd, I never thought a smile could sweetlier play, Nor that so graceful life could chase away Thy graceful death,—till those blue eyes upbeam'd. Now slumber lies in dimpled eddies drown'd, And roses bloom more rosily for joy, And odorous silence ripens into sound, And fingers move to sound.—All-beauteous boy! How thou dost waken into smiles, and prove, If not more lovely, thou art more like Love! TO FANCY. Most delicate Ariel! submissive thing, Won by the mind's high magic to its hest,— Invisible embassy, or secret guest,— Weighing the light air on a lighter wing;— Whether into the midnight moon, to bring Illuminate visions to the eye of rest,— Or rich romances from the florid West,— Or to the sea, for mystic whispering,— Still by thy charm'd allegiance to the will, The fruitful wishes prosper in the brain, As by the fingering of fairy skill,— Moonlight, and waters, and soft music's strain, Odours, and blooms, and my Miranda's smile, Making this dull world an enchanted isle. 1823. The attribution of this poem is questionable. [THE DOUBTFUL SNEEZE.] The Doubtful Sneeze! a failure quite— A winker half, and half a gaper— Alas, to paint on canvas here What should have been on tissue paper. FAIR INES. O saw ye not fair Ines? She's gone into the West, To dazzle when the sun is down, And rob the world of rest: She took our daylight with her, The smiles that we love best, With morning blushes on her cheek, And pearls upon her breast. O turn again, fair Ines, Before the fall of night, For fear the moon should shine alone, And stars unrivall'd bright; And blessed will the lover be That walks beneath their light, And breathes the love against thy cheek I dare not even write! Would I had been, fair Ines, That gallant cavalier, Who rode so gaily by thy side, And whisper'd thee so near! Were there no bonny dames at home, Or no true lovers here, That he should cross the seas to win The dearest of the dear? I saw thee, lovely Ines, Descend along the shore, With bands of noble gentlemen, And banners waved before; And gentle youth and maidens gay, And snowy plumes they wore; It would have been a beauteous dream, —If it had been no more! Alas, alas, fair Ines, She went away with song, With Music waiting on her steps, And shoutings of the throng; But some were sad and felt no mirth, But only Music's wrong, In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell, To her you've loved so long. Farewell, farewell, fair Ines, That vessel never bore So fair a lady on its deck, Nor danced so light before,— Alas, for pleasure on the sea, And sorrow on the shore! The smile that blest one lover's heart Has broken many more! TO A FALSE FRIEND. Our hands have met, but not our hearts; Our hands will never meet again. Friends, if we have ever been, Friends we cannot now remain: I only know I loved you once, I only know I loved in vain; Our hands have met, but not our hearts; Our hands will never meet again! Then farewell to heart and hand! I would our hands had never met: Even the outward form of love Must be resign'd with some regret. Friends, we still might seem to be, If I my wrong could e'er forget Our hands have join'd but not our hearts: I would our hands had never met! AUTUMN. ODE. I saw old Autumn in the misty morn Stand shadowless like Silence, listening To silence, for no lonely bird would sing Into his hollow ear from woods forlorn, Nor lowly hedge nor solitary thorn; Shaking his languid locks all dewy bright With tangled gossamer that fell by night, Pearling his coronet of golden corn. Where are the songs of Summer?—With the sun, Oping the dusky eyelids of the south, Till shade and silence waken up as one, And Morning sings with a warm odorous mouth. Where are the merry birds?—Away, away, On panting wings through the inclement skies, Lest owls should prey Undazzled at noon-day, And tear with horny beak their lustrous eyes. Where are the blooms of Summer?—In the west, Blushing their last to the last sunny hours, When the mild Eve by sudden Night is prest Like tearful Proserpine, snatch'd from her flow'rs To a most gloomy breast. Where is the pride of Summer,—the green prime,— The many, many leaves all twinkling?—Three On the moss'd elm; three on the naked lime Trembling,—and one upon the old oak tree! Where is the Dryad's immortality?— Gone into mournful cypress and dark yew, Or wearing the long gloomy Winter through In the smooth holly's green eternity. The squirrel gloats o'er his accomplish'd hoard, The ants have brimm'd their garners with ripe grain, And honey bees have stored The sweets of summer in their luscious cells; The swallows all have wing'd across the main; But here the Autumn melancholy dwells, And sighs her tearful spells Amongst the sunless shadows of the plain. Alone, alone, Upon a mossy stone, She sits and reckons up the dead and gone, With the last leaves for a love-rosary; Whilst all the wither'd world looks drearily, Like a dim picture of the drownëd past In the hush'd mind's mysterious far-away, Doubtful what ghostly thing will steal the last Into that distance, grey upon the grey. O go and sit with her, and be o'ershaded Under the languid downfall of her hair; She wears a coronal of flowers faded Upon her forehead, and a face of care;— There is enough of wither'd everywhere To make her bower,—and enough of gloom; There is enough of sadness to invite, If only for the rose that died, whose doom Is Beauty's,—she that with the living bloom Of conscious cheeks most beautifies the light: There is enough of sorrowing, and quite Enough of bitter fruits the earth doth bear,— Enough of chilly droppings from her bowl; Enough of fear and shadowy despair, To frame her cloudy prison for the soul! DEATH. SONNET. It is not death, that—sometime—in a sigh This eloquent breath shall take its speechless flight; That—sometime—these bright stars, that now reply In sunlight to the sun, shall set in night; That this warm conscious flesh shall perish quite, And all life's ruddy springs forget to flow; That thoughts shall cease, and the immortal sprite Be lapp'd in alien clay and laid below; It is not death to know this,—but to know That pious thoughts, which visit at new graves In tender pilgrimage, will cease to go So duly and so oft,—and when grass waves Over the past-away, there may be then No resurrection in the minds of men. SILENCE. SONNET. There is a silence where hath been no sound, There is a silence where no sound may be, In the cold grave—under the deep deep sea, Or in wide desert where no life is found, Which hath been mute, and still must sleep profound; No voice is hush'd—no life treads silently, But clouds and cloudy shadows wander free, That never spoke, over the idle ground: But in green ruins, in the desolate walls Of antique palaces, where Man hath been, Though the dun fox, or wild hyæna, calls, And owls, that flit continually between, Shriek to the echo, and the low winds moan,— There the true Silence is, self-conscious and alone. WRITTEN IN KEATS' “ENDYMION.” SONNET. I saw pale Dian, sitting by the brink Of silver falls, the overflow of fountains From cloudy steeps; and I grew sad to think Endymion's foot was silent on those mountains And he but a hush'd name, that Silence keeps In dear remembrance,—lonely, and forlorn, Singing it to herself until she weeps Tears, that perchance still glisten in the morn:— And as I mused, in dull imaginings, There came a flash of garments, and I knew The awful Muse by her harmonious wings Charming the air to music as she flew— Anon there rose an echo through the vale Gave back Endymion in a dreamlike tale. SONNET. TO AN ENTHUSIAST. Young ardent soul, graced with fair Nature's truth, Spring warmth of heart, and fervency of mind, And still a large late love of all thy kind, Spite of the world's cold practice and Time's tooth,— For all these gifts, I know not, in fair sooth, Whether to give thee joy, or bid thee blind Thine eyes with tears,—that thou hast not resign'd The passionate fire and fierceness of thy youth: For as the current of thy life shall flow, Gilded by shine of sun or shadow-stain'd, Through flow'ry valley or unwholesome fen, Thrice blessed in thy joy, or in thy woe Thrice cursed of thy race,—thou art ordain'd To share beyond the lot of common men. TO A COLD BEAUTY. Lady, wouldst thou heiress be To Winter's cold and cruel part? When he sets the rivers free, Thou dost still lock up thy heart;— Thou that shouldst outlast the snow, But in the whiteness of thy brow Scorn and cold neglect are made For winter gloom and winter wind, But thou wilt wrong the summer air, Breathing it to words unkind,— Breath which only should belong To love, to sunlight, and to song! When the little buds unclose, Red, and white, and pied, and blue, And that virgin flow'r, the rose, Opes her heart to hold the dew, Wilt thou lock thy bosom up With no jewel in its cup? Let not cold December sit Thus in Love's peculiar throne: Brooklets are not prison'd now, But crystal frosts are all agone, And that which hangs upon the spray, It is no snow, but flow'r of May! SERENADE Ah, sweet, thou little knowest how I wake and passionate watches keep; And yet while I address thee now, Methinks thou smilest in thy sleep. 'Tis sweet enough to make me weep, That tender thought of love and thee, That while the world is hush'd so deep, Thy soul's perhaps awake to me! Sleep on, sleep on, sweet bride of sleep! With golden visions for thy dower, While I this midnight vigil keep, And bless thee in thy silent bower; To me 'tis sweeter than the power Of sleep, and fairy dreams unfurl'd, That I alone, at this still hour, In patient love outwatch the world. OLD BALLAD. Air—“There was a King in the North Countree.” There was a Fairy lived in a well, And she pronounced a magical spell; “Whoever looks in this wave,” she said, “Shall see the lady that he's to wed!” A King came by with his hunting-spear And stoop'd to look in the waters clear; He laid by the brim his signet of gold, And gave his Brother his crown to hold. But while he knelt and was looking down, His Brother stood and tried-on the crown; The pearls were bright, and the rubies brave, So he tumbled his brother into the wave. “Oh Brother, oh Brother, you've got my ring And the lawful crown that made me king; But your heart shall fail, and your hand shall quake, And the head that wears my jewels shall ache!” The murderer stood and look'd from the brink, “The sun is so hot, I should like to drink!” But lo! as he stoop'd with a silver cup, His head went down, and his heels flew up! “Oh! Brother, oh! Brother,—I've got your crown, But the weight of the jewels has pull'd me down, You shall be crown'd in the skies again,— But I shall be mark'd on the brow like Cain!” Down he sank in the dismal wave, As cold as death, and dark as the grave; But when he came to the stones at last, The Fairy caught him, and held him fast. She took him into her crystal hall And there he saw his face in the wall; She look'd rosy, but he look'd white, And all the tapers were burning bright. The King leap'd down from his Fairy throne, With eyes that brighter than diamonds shone: His left hand balanced a golden globe, But his right hand lifted his purple robe. “Oh Brother! oh Brother! bend down your knee, But kneel to Heaven, and not to me, For God may frown on your grievous sin, But I'm too happy you push'd me in. Come hither, come hither, you're welcome now, To my crown of gold that decks your brow; There's smiles worth heav'n on my true-love's face, And she has made me King of this place!” [We did not wear a leafy crown] [The following lines, suggested by a bunch of English grapes, were written about this time—as well as the two Sonnets which succeed them—and which have never been printed before.] We did not wear a leafy crown, And darkly glance to darker glance, Under the green leaf and the brown, Wooing the eyes of maids of France, With very bloomy down: We stain'd not hands with purple blood In golden Arno's pleasant vale, Where the proud Brothers quench'd the stain, And saw two murderers in the flood With faces guilty-pale: Nor on the sunny hills of Spain We used to drink the sun and twine Long amorous tendrils to entrap The careless finger of maid to linger And pluck us from the trembling vine To brim her dimpled lap. SONNET. [Love, I am jealous of a worthless man] Love, I am jealous of a worthless man Whom—for his merits—thou dost hold too dear: No better than myself, he lies as near And precious to thy bosom. He may span Thy sacred waist and with thy sweet breath fan His happy cheek, and thy most willing ear Invade with words and call his love sincere And true as mine, and prove it—if he can:— Not that I hate him for such deeds as this— He were a devil to adore thee less, Who wears thy favour,—I am ill at ease Rather lest he should e'er too coldly press Thy gentle hand:—This is my jealousy Making myself suspect but never thee! SONNET. [Love, see thy lover humbled at thy feet] Love, see thy lover humbled at thy feet, Not in servility, but homage sweet, Gladly inclined:—and with my bended knee Think that my inward spirit bows to thee— More proud indeed than when I stand or climb Elsewhere:—there is no statue so sublime As Love's in all the world, and e'en to kiss The pedestal is still a better bliss Than all ambitions. O! Love's lowest base Is far above the reaching of disgrace To shame this posture. Let me then draw nigh Feet that have fared so nearly to the sky, And when this duteous homage has been given I will rise up and clasp the heart in Heaven. 1824. THE FORSAKEN. The dead are in their silent graves, And the dew is cold above, And the living weep and sigh, Over dust that once was love. Once I only wept the dead, But now the living cause my pain: How couldst thou steal me from my tears, To leave me to my tears again? My Mother rests beneath the sod,— Her rest is calm and very deep: I wish'd that she could see our loves,— But now I gladden in her sleep. Last night unbound my raven locks, The morning saw them turn'd to grey, Once they were black and well beloved, But thou art changed,—and so are they! The useless lock I gave thee once, To gaze upon and think of me, Was ta'en with smiles,—but this was torn In sorrow that I send to thee! SONG. [The stars are with the voyager] The stars are with the voyager Wherever he may sail; The moon is constant to her time; The sun will never fail; But follow, follow round the world, The green earth and the sea, So love is with the lover's heart, Wherever he may be. Wherever he may be, the stars Must daily lose their light; The moon will veil her in the shade; The sun will set at night. The sun may set, but constant love Will shine when he's away; So that dull night is never night, And day is brighter day. SONG. [O Lady, leave thy silken thread] O Lady, leave thy silken thread And flowery tapestrie: There's living roses on the bush, And blossoms on the tree; Stoop where thou wilt, thy careless hand Some random bud will meet; Thou canst not tread, but thou wilt find The daisy at thy feet. 'Tis like the birthday of the world, When earth was born in bloom; The light is made of many dyes, The air is all perfume; There's crimson buds, and white and blue— The very rainbow showers Have turn'd to blossoms where they fell, And sown the earth with flowers. There's fairy tulips in the east, The garden of the sun; The very streams reflect the hues, And blossom as they run: While Morn opes like a crimson rose, Still wet with pearly showers; Then, lady, leave the silken thread Thou twinest into flowers! BIRTHDAY VERSES. Good morrow to the golden morning, Good morrow to the world's delight— I've come to bless thy life's beginning, Since it makes my own so bright! I have brought no roses, sweetest, I could find no flowers, dear,— It was when all sweets were over Thou wert born to bless the year. But I've brought thee jewels, dearest, In thy bonny locks to shine,— And if love shows in their glances, They have learn'd that look of mine! I LOVE THEE. I love thee—I love thee! 'Tis all that I can say;— It is my vision in the night, My dreaming in the day; The very echo of my heart, The blessing when I pray: I love thee—I love thee! Is all that I can say. I love thee—I love thee! Is ever on my tongue; In all my proudest poesy That chorus still is sung; It is the verdict of my eyes, Amidst the gay and young: I love thee—I love thee! A thousand maids among. I love thee—I love thee! Thy bright and hazel glance, The mellow lute upon those lips, Whose tender tones entrance; But most, dear heart of hearts, thy proofs That still these words enhance. I love thee—I love thee! Whatever be thy chance. LINES. [Let us make a leap, my dear] Let us make a leap, my dear, In our love, of many a year, And date it very far away, On a bright clear summer day, When the heart was like a sun To itself, and falsehood none; And the rosy lips a part Of the very loving heart, And the shining of the eye But a sign to know it by;— When my faults were all forgiven, And my life deserved of Heaven. Dearest, let us reckon so, And love for all that long ago; Each absence count a year complete, And keep a birthday when we meet. FALSE POETS AND TRUE. TO WORDSWORTH. Look how the lark soars upward and is gone, Turning a spirit as he nears the sky! His voice is heard, but body there is none To fix the vague excursions of the eye. So, poets' songs are with us, tho' they die Obscured, and hid by death's oblivious shroud, And Earth inherits the rich melody Like raining music from the morning cloud. Yet, few there be who pipe so sweet and loud Their voices reach us through the lapse of space: The noisy day is deafen'd by a crowd Of undistinguish'd birds, a twittering race; But only lark and nightingale forlorn Fill up the silences of night and morn. [“Farewell—Farewell”—it is an awful word] “Farewell—Farewell”—it is an awful word When that the quick do speak it to the dead; For though 'tis brief upon the speaker's lips, 'Tis more than death can answer to, and hath No living echo on the living ear. 'Tis awful to behold the midnight stars They say do rule the destinies of men, Gazing upon us from that point of space, Where they were set even from their lustrous birth, With a most sure foreknowledge of our doom Watching its consummation. GUIDO AND MARINA. A DRAMATIC SKETCH. [Guido, having given himself up to the pernicious study of magic and astrology, casts his nativity, and resolves that at a certain hour of a certain day he is to die. Marina, to wean him from this fatal delusion, which hath gradually wasted him away, even to the verge of death, advances the hour-hand of the clock. He is supposed to be seated beside her in the garden of his palace at Venice.] Guido. Clasp me again! My soul is very sad; And hold thy lips in readiness near mine, Lest I die suddenly. Clasp me again! 'Tis such a gloomy day! Mar. Nay, sweet, it shines. Guido. Nay, then, these mortal clouds are in mine eyes. Clasp me again!—ay, with thy fondest force, Give me one last embrace. Mar. Love, I do clasp thee! Guido. Then closer—closer—for I feel thee not; Unless thou art this pain around my heart. Thy lips at such a time should never leave me. Mar. What pain—what time, love? Art thou ill? Alas! I see it in thy cheek. Come, let me nurse thee. Here, rest upon my heart. Guido. Stay, stay, Marina. Look!—when I raise my hand against the sun, Is it red with blood? Mar. Alas! my love, what wilt thou? Thy hand is red—and so is mine—all hands Show thus against the sun. Guido. All living men's. Marina, but not mine. Hast never heard How death first seizes on the feet and hands, And thence goes freezing to the very heart? Mar. Yea, love, I know it; but what then?—the hand I hold is glowing. Guido. But my eyes!—my eyes!— Look there, Marina—there is death's own sign. I have seen a corpse, E'en when its clay was cold, would still have seem'd Alive, but for the eyes—such deadly eyes! So dull and dim! Marina, look in mine! Mar. Ay, they are dull. No, no—not dull, but bright: I see myself within them. Now, dear love, Discard these horrid fears that make me weep. Guido. Marina, Marina—where thy image lies, There must be brightness—or perchance they glance And glimmer like the lamp before it dies. Oh, do not vex my soul with hopes impossible! My hours are ending. [Clock strikes. Mar. Nay, they shall not! Hark! The hour—four—five—hark!—six!—the very time! And, lo! thou art alive! My love—dear love— Now cast this cruel phantasm from thy brain— This wilful, wild delusion—cast it off! The hour is come—and gone! What! not a word! What, not a smile, even, that thou livest for me! Come, laugh and clap your hands as I do—come. Or kneel with me, and thank th' eternal God For this blest passover! Still sad! still mute!— Oh, why art thou not glad, as I am glad, That death forbears thee? Nay, hath all my love Been spent in vain, that thou art sick of life? Guido. Marina, I am no more attach'd to death Than Fate hath doomed me. I am his elect, That even now forestalls thy little light, And steals with cold infringement on my breath: Already he bedims my spiritual lamp, Not yet his due—not yet—quite yet, though Time, Perchance, to warn me, speaks before his wont: Some minutes' space my blood has still to flow— Some scanty breath is left me still to spend In very bitter sighs. But there's a point, true measured by my pulse, Beyond or short of which it may not live By one poor throb. Marina, it is near. Mar. Oh, God of heaven! Guido. Ay, it is very near. Therefore, cling now to me, and say farewell While I can answer it. Marina, speak! Why tear thine helpless hair? it will not save Thy heart from breaking, nor pluck out the thought That stings thy brain. Oh, surely thou hast known This truth too long to look so like Despair? Mar. O, no, no, no!—a hope—a little hope— I had erewhile—but I have heard its knell. Oh, would my life were measured out with thine— All my years number'd—all my days, my hours, My utmost minutes, all summ'd up with thine! Guido. Marina— Mar. Let me weep—no, let me kneel To God—but rather thee—to spare this end That is so wilful. Oh, for pity's sake! Pluck back thy precious spirit from these clouds That smother it with death. Oh! turn from death, And do not woo it with such dark resolve, To make me widow'd. Guido. I have lived my term. Mar. No—not thy term—no! not the natural term Of one so young. Oh! thou hast spent thy years In sinful waste upon unholy— Guido. Hush! Marina. Mar. Nay, I must. Oh! cursed lore, That hath supplied this spell against thy life. Unholy learning—devilish and dark— Study! O, God! O, God!—how can thy stars Be bright with such black knowledge? Oh, that men Should ask more light of them than guides their steps At evening to love! Guido. Hush, hush, oh hush! Thy words have pain'd me in the midst of pain. True, if I had not read, I should not die; For, if I had not read, I had not been. All our acts of life are pre-ordain'd, And each pre-acted, in our several spheres, By ghostly duplicates. They sway our deeds By their performance. What if mine hath been To be a prophet and foreknow my doom? If I had closed my eyes, the thunder then Had roar'd it in my ears; my own mute brain Had told it with a tongue. What must be, must. Therefore I knew when my full time would fall; And now—to save thy widowhood of tears— To spare the very breaking of thy heart, I may not gain even a brief hour's reprieve! What seest thou yonder? Mar. Where?—a tree—the sun Sinking behind a tree. Guido. It is no tree, Marina, but a shape—the awful shape That comes to claim me. Seest thou not his shade Darken before his steps? Ah me! how cold It comes against my feet! Cold, icy cold! And blacker than a pall. Mar. My love! Guido. Oh heaven And earth, where are ye? Marina— [Guido dies. Mar. I am here! What wilt thou? dost thou speak?—Methought I heard thee Just whispering. He is dead?—O God! he's dead! THE TWO SWANS. A FAIRY TALE. Immortal Imogen, crown'd queen above The lilies of thy sex, vouchsafe to hear A fairy dream in honour of true love— True above ills, and frailty, and all fear— Perchance a shadow of his own career Whose youth was darkly prison'd and long-twined By serpent-sorrow, till white Love drew near, And sweetly sang him free, and round his mind A bright horizon threw, wherein no grief may wind. I saw a tower builded on a lake, Mock'd by its inverse shadow, dark and deep— That seem'd a still intenser night to make, Wherein the quiet waters sank to sleep,— And, whatsoe'er was prison'd in that keep, A monstrous Snake was warden:—round and round In sable ringlets I beheld him creep, Blackest amid black shadows, to the ground, Whilst his enormous head the topmost turret crown'd. From whence he shot fierce light against the stars, Making the pale moon paler with affright; And with his ruby eye out-threaten'd Mars— That blazed in the mid-heavens, hot and bright— Nor slept, nor wink'd, but with a steadfast spite Watch'd their wan looks and tremblings in the skies; And that he might not slumber in the night, The curtain-lids were pluck'd from his large eyes, So he might never drowse, but watch his secret prize. Prince or princess in dismal durance pent, Victims of old Enchantment's love or hate, Their lives must all in painful sighs be spent, Watching the lonely waters soon and late, And clouds that pass and leave them to their fate, Or company their grief with heavy tears:— Meanwhile that Hope can spy no golden gate For sweet escapement, but in darksome fears They weep and pine away as if immortal years. No gentle bird with gold upon its wing Will perch upon the grate—the gentle bird Is safe in leafy dell, and will not bring Freedom's sweet key-note and commission-word Learn'd of a fairy's lips, for pity stirr'd— Lest while he trembling sings, untimely guest! Watch'd by that cruel Snake and darkly heard, He leave a widow on her lonely nest, To press in silent grief the darlings of her breast. No gallant knight, adventurous, in his bark, Will seek the fruitful perils of the place, To rouse with dipping oar the waters dark That bear that serpent-image on their face. And Love, brave Love! though he attempt the base, Nerved to his loyal death, he may not win His captive lady from the strict embrace Of that foul Serpent, clasping her within His sable folds—like Eve enthrall'd by the old Sin. But there is none—no knight in panoply, Nor Love, intrench'd in his strong steely coat: No little speck—no sail—no helper nigh, No sign—no whispering—no plash of boat:— The distant shores show dimly and remote, Made of a deeper mist,—serene and grey,— And slow and mute the cloudy shadows float Over the gloomy wave, and pass away, Chased by the silver beams that on their marges play. And bright and silvery the willows sleep Over the shady verge—no mad winds tease Their hoary heads; but quietly they weep Their sprinkling leaves—half fountains and half trees: There lilies be—and fairer than all these, A solitary Swan her breast of snow Launches against the wave that seems to freeze Into a chaste reflection, still below Twin-shadow of herself wherever she may go. And forth she paddles in the very noon Of solemn midnight like an elfin thing, Charm'd into being by the argent moon— Whose silver light for love of her fair wing Goes with her in the shade, still worshipping Her dainty plumage:—all around her grew A radiant circlet, like a fairy ring; And all behind, a tiny little clue Of light, to guide her back across the waters blue. And sure she is no meaner than a fay, Redeem'd from sleepy death, for beauty's sake, By old ordainment:—silent as she lay, Touch'd by a moonlight wand I saw her wake, And cut her leafy slough, and so forsake The verdant prison of her lily peers, That slept amidst the stars upon the lake— A breathing shape—restored to human fears, And new-born love and grief—self-conscious of her tears. And now she clasps her wings around her heart, And near that lonely isle begins to glide, Pale as her fears, and oft-times with a start Turns her impatient head from side to side In universal terrors—all too wide To watch; and often to that marble keep Upturns her pearly eyes, as if she spied Some foe, and crouches in the shadows steep That in the gloomy wave go diving fathoms deep. And well she may, to spy that fearful thing All down the dusky walls in circlets wound; Alas! for what rare prize, with many a ring Girding the marble casket round and round? His folded tail, lost in the gloom profound, Terribly darkeneth the rocky base; But on the top his monstrous head is crown'd With prickly spears, and on his doubtful face Gleam his unwearied eyes, red watchers of the place. Alas! of the hot fires that nightly fall, No one will scorch him in those orbs of spite, So he may never see beneath the wall That timid little creature, all too bright, That stretches her fair neck, slender and white, Invoking the pale moon, and vainly tries Her throbbing throat, as if to charm the night With song—but, hush—it perishes in sighs, And there will be no dirge sad-swelling, though she dies! She droops—she sinks—she leans upon the lake, Fainting again into a lifeless flower; But soon the chilly springs anoint and wake Her spirit from its death, and with new power She sheds her stifled sorrows in a shower Of tender song, timed to her falling tears— That wins the shady summit of that tower, And, trembling all the sweeter for its fears. Fills with imploring moan that cruel monster's ears. And, lo! the scaly beast is all deprest, Subdued like Argus by the might of sound— What time Apollo his sweet lute addrest To magic converse with the air, and bound The many monster eyes, all slumber-drown'd:— So on the turret-top that watchful Snake Pillows his giant head, and lists profound, As if his wrathful spite would never wake, Charm'd into sudden sleep for Love and Beauty's sake! His prickly crest lies prone upon his crown, And thirsty lip from lip disparted flies, To drink that dainty flood of music down— His scaly throat is big with pent-up sighs— And whilst his hollow ear entrancëd lies, His looks for envy of the charmed sense Are fain to listen, till his steadfast eyes, Stung into pain by their own impotence, Distil enormous tears into the lake immense. Oh, tuneful Swan! oh, melancholy bird! Sweet was that midnight miracle of song, Rich with ripe sorrow, needful of no word To tell of pain, and love, and love's deep wrong— Hinting a piteous tale—perchance how long Thy unknown tears were mingled with the lake, What time disguised thy leafy mates among— And no eye knew what human love and ache Dwelt in those dewy leaves, and heart so nigh to break. Therefore no poet will ungently touch The water-lily, on whose eyelids dew Trembles like tears; but ever hold it such As human pain may wander through and through, Turning the pale leaf paler in its hue— Wherein life dwells, transfigured, not entomb'd, By magic spells. Alas! who ever knew Sorrow in all its shapes, leafy and plumed, Or in gross husks of brutes eternally inhumed? And now the winged song has scaled the height Of that dark dwelling, builded for despair, And soon a little casement flashing bright Widens self-open'd into the cool air— That music like a bird may enter there And soothe the captive in his stony cage; For there is nought of grief, or painful care, But plaintive song may happily engage From sense of its own ill, and tenderly assuage. And forth into the light, small and remote, A creature, like the fair son of a king, Draws to the lattice in his jewell'd coat Against the silver moonlight glistening, And leans upon his white hand listening To that sweet music that with tenderer tone Salutes him, wondering what kindly thing Is come to soothe him with so tuneful moan, Singing beneath the walls as if for him alone And while he listens, the mysterious song, Woven with timid particles of speech, Twines into passionate words that grieve along The melancholy notes, and softly teach The secrets of true love,—that trembling reach His earnest ear, and through the shadows dun He missions like replies, and each to each Their silver voices mingle into one, Like blended streams that make one music as they run. “Ah! Love, my hope is swooning in my heart,—” “Ay, sweet, my cage is strong and hung full high—” “Alas! our lips are held so far apart, Thy words come faint,—they have so far to fly!—” “If I may only shun that serpent-eye,—” “Ah me! that serpent-eye doth never sleep;—” “Then, nearer thee, Love's martyr, I will die!—” “Alas, alas! that word has made me weep! For pity's sake remain safe in thy marble keep!” “My marble keep! it is my marble tomb—” “Nay, sweet! but thou hast there thy living breath—,” “Aye to expend in sighs for this hard doom;—” “But I will come to thee and sing beneath, And nightly so beguile this serpent wreath;—” “Nay, I will find a path from these despairs.” “Ah, needs then thou must tread the back of death, Making his stony ribs thy stony stairs.— Behold his ruby eye, how fearfully it glares!” Full sudden at these words, the princely youth Leaps on the scaly back that slumbers, still Unconscious of his foot, yet not for ruth, But numb'd to dulness by the fairy skill Of that sweet music (all more wild and shrill For intense fear) that charm'd him as he lay— Meanwhile the lover nerves his desperate will, Held some short throbs by natural dismay, Then down the serpent-track begins his darksome way. Now dimly seen—now toiling out of sight, Eclipsed and cover'd by the envious wall Now fair and spangled in the sudden light, And clinging with wide arms for fear of fall; Now dark and shelter'd by a kindly pall Of dusky shadow from his wakeful foe; Slowly he winds adown—dimly and small, Watch'd by the gentle Swan that sings below, Her hope increasing, still, the larger he doth grow. But nine times nine the serpent folds embrace The marble walls about—which he must tread Before his anxious foot may touch the base: Long is the dreary path, and must be sped! But Love, that holds the mastery of dread, Braces his spirit, and with constant toil He wins his way, and now, with arms outspread Impatient plunges from the last long coil: So may all gentle Love ungentle Malice foil! The song is hush'd, the charm is all complete, And two fair Swans are swimming on the lake: But scarce their tender bills have time to meet, When fiercely drops adown that cruel Snake— His steely scales a fearful rustling make, Like autumn leaves that tremble and foretell The sable storm;—the plumy lovers quake— And feel the troubled waters pant and swell, Heaved by the giant bulk of their pursuer fell. His jaws, wide yawning like the gates of Death, Hiss horrible pursuit—his red eyes glare The waters into blood—his eager breath Grows hot upon their plumes:—now, minstrel fair! She drops her ring into the waves, and there It widens all around, a fairy ring Wrought of the silver light—the fearful pair Swim in the very midst, and pant and cling The closer for their fears, and tremble wing to wing. Bending their course over the pale grey lake, Against the pallid East, wherein light play'd In tender flushes, still the baffled Snake Circled them round continually, and bay'd Hoarsely and loud, forbidden to invade The sanctuary ring—his sable mail Roll'd darkly through the flood, and writhed and made A shining track over the waters pale, Lash'd into boiling foam by his enormous tail. And so they sail'd into the distance dim, Into the very distance—small and white, Like snowy blossoms of the spring that swim Over the brooklets—follow'd by the spite Of that huge Serpent, that with wild affright Worried them on their course, and sore annoy, Till on the grassy marge I saw them 'light, And change, anon, a gentle girl and boy, Lock'd in embrace of sweet unutterable joy! Then came the Morn, and with her pearly showers Wept on them, like a mother, in whose eyes Tears are no grief; and from his rosy bowers The Oriental sun began to rise, Chasing the darksome shadows from the skies; Wherewith that sable Serpent far away Fled, like a part of night—delicious sighs From waking blossoms purified the day, And little birds were singing sweetly from each spray. ODE ON A DISTANT PROSPECT OF CLAPHAM ACADEMY. Ah me! those old familiar bounds! That classic house, those classic grounds My pensive thought recalls! What tender urchins now confine, What little captives now repine, Within you irksome walls? Ay, that's the very house! I know Its ugly windows, ten a-row! Its chimneys in the rear! And there's the iron rod so high, That drew the thunder from the sky And turn'd our table-beer! There I was birch'd! there I was bred! There like a little Adam fed From Learning's woeful tree! The weary tasks I used to con!— The hopeless leaves I wept upon!— Most fruitless leaves to me!— The summon'd class!—the awful bow!— I wonder who is master now And wholesome anguish sheds! How many ushers now employs, How many maids to see the boys Have nothing in their heads! And Mrs. S????—Doth she abet (Like Pallas in the parlour) yet Some favour'd two or three,— The little Crichtons of the hour, Her muffin-medals that devour, And swill her prize—bohea? Ay, there's the playground! there's the lime, Beneath whose shade in summer's prime So wildly I have read!— Who sits there now, and skims the cream Of young Romance, and weaves a dream Of Love and Cottage-bread? Who struts the Randall of the walk? Who models tiny heads in chalk? Who scoops the light canoe? What early genius buds apace? Where's Poynter? Harris? Bowers? Chase? Hal Baylis? blithe Carew? Alack! they're gone—a thousand ways! And some are serving in “the Greys,” And some have perish'd young!— Jack Harris weds his second wife; Hal Baylis drives the wane of life; And blithe Carew—is hung! Grave Bowers teaches A B C To savages at Owhyee Poor Chase is with the worms!— All, all are gone—the olden breed!— New crops of mushroom boys succeed, “And push us from our forms!” Lo! where they scramble forth, and shout, And leap, and skip, and mob about, At play where we have play'd! Some hop, some run, (some fall,) some twine Their crony arms; some in the shine,— And some are in the shade! Lo there what mix'd conditions run! The orphan lad; the widow's son; And Fortune's favour'd care— The wealthy-born, for whom she hath Mac-Adamised the future path— The Nabob's pamper'd heir! Some brightly starr'd—some evil born,— For honour some, and some for scorn,— For fair or foul renown! Good, bad, indiff'rent—none may lack! Look, here's a White, and there's a Black! And there's a Creole brown! Some laugh and sing, some mope and weep, And wish their ‘frugal sires would keep Their only sons at home;’— Some tease the future tense, and plan The full-grown doings of the man, And pant for years to come! A foolish wish! There's one at hoop; And four at fives! and five who stoop The marble taw to speed! And one that curvets in and out, Reining his fellow Cob about,— Would I were in his stead! Yet he would gladly halt and drop That boyish harness off, to swop With this world's heavy van— To toil, to tug. O little fool! While thou canst be a horse at school, To wish to be a man! Perchance thou deem'st it were a thing To wear a crown,—to be a king! And sleep on regal down! Alas! thou know'st not kingly cares; Far happier is thy head that wears That hat without a crown! And dost thou think that years acquire New added joys? Dost think thy sire More happy than his son? That manhood's mirth?—Oh, go thy ways To Drury-lane when ? plays, And see how forced our fun! Thy taws are brave!—thy tops are rare!— Our tops are spun with coils of care, Our dumps are no delight!— The Elgin marbles are but tame, And 'tis at best a sorry game To fly the Muse's kite! Our hearts are dough, our heels are lead, Our topmost joys fall dull and dead Like balls with no rebound! And often with a faded eye We look behind, and send a sigh Towards that merry ground! Then be contented. Thou hast got The most of heaven in thy young lot; There's sky-blue in thy cup! Thou'lt find thy Manhood all too fast— Soon come, soon gone! and Age at last A sorry breaking-up! 1825. ODE TO MR. GRAHAM, THE AERONAUT. “Up with me!—up with me into the sky!” Wordsworth—on a Lark! Dear Graham, whilst the busy crowd, The vain, the wealthy, and the proud, Their meaner flights pursue, Let us cast off the foolish ties That bind us to the earth, and rise And take a bird's-eye view!— A few more whiffs of my cigar And then, in Fancy's airy car, Have with thee for the skies:— How oft this fragrant smoke upcurl'd Hath borne me from this little world, And all that in it lies!— Away!—away!—the bubble fills— Farewell to earth and all its hills!— We seem to cut the wind!— So high we mount, so swift we go, The chimney tops are far below, The Eagle's left behind!— Ah me! my brain begins to swim!— The world is growing rather dim; The steeples and the trees— My wife is getting very small! I cannot see my babe at all!— The Dollond, if you please!— Do, Graham, let me have a quiz, Lord! what a Lilliput it is, That little world of Mogg's!— Are those the London Docks?-that channel, The mighty Thames?-a proper kennel For that small Isle of Dogs!— What is that seeming tea-urn there? That fairy dome, St. Paul's!—I swear, Wren must have been a Wren!— And that small stripe?—it cannot be The City Road!—Good lack! to see The little ways of men! Little, indeed!—my eyeballs ache To find a turnpike.—I must take Their tolls upon my trust!— And where is mortal labour gone? Look, Graham, for a little stone Mac Adamized to dust! Look at the horses!—less than flies!— Oh, what a waste it was of sighs To wish to be a Mayor! What is the honour?—none at all, One's honour must be very small For such a civic chair!— And there's Guildhall!-'tis far aloof— Methinks, I fancy through the roof Its little guardian Gogs Like penny dolls—a tiny show!— Well,—I must say they're ruled below By very little logs!— Oh! Graham, how the upper air Alters the standards of compare; One of our silken flags Would cover London all about— Nay then-let's even empty out Another brace of bags! Now for a glass of bright champagne Above the clouds!—Come, let us drain A bumper as we go!— But hold!—for God's sake do not cant The cork away—unless you want To brain your friends below. Think! what a mob of little men Are crawling just within our ken, Like mites upon a cheese!— Pshaw!—how the foolish sight rebukes Ambitious thoughts!—can there be Dukes Of Gloster such as these!— Oh! what is glory?—what is fame? Hark to the little mob's acclaim, 'Tis nothing but a hum!— A few near gnats would trump as loud As all the shouting of a crowd That has so far to come!— Well—they are wise that choose the near, A few small buzzards in the ear, To organs ages hence!— Ah me, how distance touches all; It makes the true look rather small, But murders poor pretence. “The world recedes!—it disappears! Heav'n opens on my eyes—my ears With buzzing noises ring!”— A fig for Southey's Laureat lore!— What's Rogers here?—Who cares for Moore That hears the Angels sing!— A fig for earth, and all its minions!— We are above the world's opinions, Graham! we'll have our own!— Look what a vantage height we've got!— Now—do you think Sir Walter Scott Is such a Great Unknown? Speak up,—or hath he hid his name To crawl through “subways” unto fame, Like Williams of Cornhill?— Speak up, my lad!—when men run small We'll show what's little in them all, Receive it how they will!— Think now of Irving!—shall he preach The princes down,—shall he impeach The potent and the rich, Merely on ethic stilts,—and I Not moralize at two miles high The true didactic pitch! Come:—what d'ye think of Jeffrey, sir? Is Gifford such a Gulliver In Lilliput's Review, That like Colossus he should stride Certain small brazen inches wide For poets to pass through? Look down! the world is but a spot. Now say—Is Blackwood's low or not, For all the Scottish tone? It shall not weigh us here—not where The sandy burden's lost in air— Our lading—where is't flown? Now,—like you Croly's verse indeed— In heaven—where one cannot read The “Warren” on a wall? What think you here of that man's fame? Though Jerdan magnified his name, To me 'tis very small! And, truly, is there such a spell In those three letters, L. E. L., To witch a world with song? On clouds the Byron did not sit, Yet dared on Shakspeare's head to spit, And say the world was wrong! And shall not we? Let's think aloud! Thus being couch'd upon a cloud, Graham, we'll have our eyes! We felt the great when we were less, But we'll retort on littleness Now we are in the skies. O Graham, Graham, how I blame The bastard blush,—the petty shame. That used to fret me quite,— The little sores I cover'd then, No sores on earth, nor sorrows when The world is out of sight! My name is Tims.—I am the man That North's unseen diminish'd clan So scurvily abused! I am the very P. A. Z. The London's Lion's small pin's head So often hath refused! Campbell—(you cannot see him here)— Hath scorn'd my lays:—do his appear Such great eggs from the sky?— And Longman, and his lengthy Co. Long only in a little Row, Have thrust my poems by! What else?—I'm poor, and much beset With damn'd small duns—that is—in debt Some grains of golden dust! But only worth above, is worth.— What's all the credit of the earth? An inch of cloth on trust! What's Rothschild here, that wealthy man! Nay, worlds of wealth?—Oh, if you can Spy out,—the Golden Ball! Sure as we rose, all money sank: What's gold or silver now?—the Bank Is gone—the 'Change and all! What's all the ground-rent of the globe?— Oh, Graham, it would worry Job To hear its landlords prate! But after this survey, I think I'll ne'er be bullied more, nor shrink From men of large estate! And less, still less, will I submit To poor mean acres' worth of wit— I that have heaven's span— I that like Shakspeare's self may dream Beyond the very clouds, and seem An Universal Man! Mark, Graham, mark those gorgeous crowds! Like Birds of Paradise the clouds Are winging on the wind! But what is grander than their range? More lovely than their sun-set change?— The free creative mind! Well! the Adults' School's in the air! The greatest men are lesson'd there As well as the Lessee! Oh could Earth's Ellistons thus small Behold the greatest stage of all, How humbled they would be! “Oh would some Power the giftie gie 'em To see themselves as others see 'em,” 'Twould much abate their fuss! If they could think that from the skies They are as little in our eyes As they can think of us! Of us! are we gone out of sight? Lessen'd! diminish'd! vanish'd quite! Lost to the tiny town! Beyond the Eagle's ken—the grope Of Dollond's longest telescope! Graham! we're going down! Ah me! I've touch'd a string that opes The airy valve!—the gas elopes— Down goes our bright Balloon!— Farewell the skies! the clouds! I smell The lower world! Graham, farewell, Man of the silken moon! The earth is close! the City nears— Like a burnt paper it appears, Studded with tiny sparks! Methinks I hear the distant rout Of coaches rumbling all about— We're close above the Parks! I hear the watchmen on their beats, Hawking the hour about the streets. Lord! what a cruel jar It is upon the earth to light! Well—there's the finish of our flight! I've smoked my last cigar! ODE TO MR. M'ADAM. “Let us take to the road!” —Beggar's Opera. M'Adam, hail! Hail, Roadian! hail, Colossus! who dost stand Striding ten thousand turnpikes on the land! Oh universal Leveller! all hail! To thee, a good, yet stony-hearted man, The kindest one, and yet the flintiest going,— To thee,—how much for thy commodious plan, Lanark Reformer of the Ruts, is Owing! The Bristol mail Gliding o'er ways, hitherto deem'd invincible, When carrying Patriots, now shall never fail Those of the most “unshaken public principle.” Hail to thee, Scot of Scots! Thou northern light, amid those heavy men! Foe to Stonehenge, yet friend to all beside, Thou scatter'st flints and favours far and wide, From palaces to cots;— Dispenser of coagulated good! Distributor of granite and of food! Long may thy fame its even path march on, E'en when thy sons are dead! Best benefactor! though thou giv'st a stone To those who ask for bread! Thy first great trial in this mighty town Was, if I rightly recollect, upon That gentle hill which goeth Down from “the County” to the Palace gate, And, like a river, thanks to thee, now floweth Past the Old Horticultural Society,— The chemist Cobb's, the house of Howell and James, Where ladies play high shawl and satin games— A little Hell of lace! And past the Athenæum, made of late, Severs a sweet variety Of milliners and booksellers who grace Waterloo Place, Making division, the Muse fears and guesses, 'Twixt Mr. Rivington's and Mr. Hessey's. Thou stood'st thy trial, Mac! and shaved the road From Barber Beaumont's to the King's abode So well, that paviors threw their rammers by, Let down their tuck'd shirt sleeves, and with a sigh Prepared themselves, poor souls, to chip or die! Next, from the palace to the prison, thou Didst go, the highway's watchman, to thy beat,— Preventing though the rattling in the street, Yet kicking up a row, Upon the stones—ah! truly watchman-like, Encouraging thy victims all to strike, To further thy own purpose, Adam, daily;— Thou hast smooth'd, alas, the path to the Old Bailey! And to the stony bowers Of Newgate, to encourage the approach, By caravan or coach,— Hast strew'd the way with flints as soft as flowers. Who shall dispute thy name! Insculpt in stone in every street, We soon shall greet Thy trodden down, yet all unconquer'd fame! Where'er we take, even at this time, our way, Nought see we, but mankind in open air, Hammering thy fame, as Chantrey would not dare;— And with a patient care Chipping thy immortality all day! Demosthenes, of old,—that rare old man,— Prophetically follow'd, Mac! thy plan:— For he, we know, (History says so,) Put pebbles in his mouth when he would speak The smoothest Greek! It is “impossible, and cannot be,” But that thy genius hath, Besides the turnpike, many another path Trod, to arrive at popularity. O'er Pegasus, perchance, thou hast thrown a thigh, Nor ridden a roadster only;—mighty Mac! And 'faith I'd swear, when on that wingèd hack, Thou hast observed the highways in the sky! Is the path up Parnassus rough and steep, And “hard to climb,” as Dr. B. would say? Dost think it best for Sons of Song to keep The noiseless tenor of their way? (see Gray.) What line of road should poets take to bring Themselves unto those waters, loved the first!— Those waters which can wet a man to sing! Which, like thy fame, “from granite basins burst, Leap into life, and, sparkling, woo the thirst?” That thou'rt a proser, even thy birthplace might Vouchsafe;—and Mr. Cadell may, God wot, Have paid thee many a pound for many a blot,— Cadell's a wayward wight! Although no Walter, still thou art a Scot, And I can throw, I think, a little light Upon some works thou hast written for the town,— And publish'd, like a Lilliput Unknown! “Highways and Byeways” is thy book, no doubt, (One whole edition's out,) And next, for it is fair That Fame, Seeing her children, should confess she had 'em;— “Some Passages from the life of Adam Blair,”— (Blair is a Scottish name,) What are they, but thy own good roads, M'Adam? O! indefatigable labourer In the paths of men! when thou shalt die, 'twill be A mark of thy surpassing industry, That of the monument, which men shall rear Over thy most inestimable bone, Thou didst thy very self lay the first stone!— Of a right ancient line thou comest,—through Each crook and turn we trace the unbroken clue, Until we see thy sire before our eyes,— Rolling his gravel walks in Paradise! But he, our great Mac Parent, err'd, and ne'er Have our walks since been fair! Yet Time, who, like the merchant, lives on 'Change, For ever varying, through his varying range, Time maketh all things even! In this strange world, turning beneath high heaven, He hath redeem'd the Adams, and contrived,— (How are Time's wonders hived!) In pity to mankind, and to befriend 'em,— (Time is above all praise,) That he, who first did make our evil ways, Reborn in Scotland, should be first to mend 'em! A FRIENDLY EPISTLE TO MRS. FRY, IN NEWGATE. “Sermons in stones.” —As you like It. “Out! out! damned spot!” —Macbeth. I like you, Mrs. Fry! I like your name! It speaks the very warmth you feel in pressing In daily act round Charity's great flame— I like the crisp Browne way you have of dressing, Good Mrs. Fry! I like the placid claim You make to Christianity,—professing Love, and good works—of course you buy of Barton, Beside the young fry's bookseller, Friend Darton! I like, good Mrs. Fry, your brethren mute— Those serious, solemn gentlemen that sport— I should have said, that wear, the sober suit Shaped like a court dress—but for heaven's court. I like your sisters too,—sweet Rachel's fruit— Protestant nuns! I like their stiff support Of virtue—and I like to see them clad With such a difference—just like good from bad! I like the sober colours—not the wet; Those gaudy manufactures of the rainbow— Green, orange, crimson, purple, violet— In which the fair, the flirting, and the vain, go— The others are a chaste, severer set, In which the good, the pious, and the plain, go— They're moral standards, to know Christians by— In short, they are your colours, Mrs. Fry! As for the naughty tinges of the prism— Crimson's the cruel uniform of war— Blue—hue of brimstone! minds no catechism; And green is young and gay—not noted for Goodness, or gravity, or quietism, Till it is sadden'd down to tea-green, or Olive—and purple's giv'n to wine, I guess; And yellow is a convict by its dress! They're all the devil's liveries, that men And women wear in servitude to sin— But how will they come off, poor motleys, when Sin's wages are paid down, and they stand in The Evil presence? You and I know, then How all the party colours will begin To part—the Pittite hues will sadden there, Whereas the Foxite shades will all show fair! Witness their goodly labours one by one! Russet makes garments for the needy poor— Dove-colour preaches love to all—and dun Calls every day at Charity's street-door— Brown studies scripture, and bids woman shun All gaudy furnishing—olive doth pour Oil into wounds: and drab and slate supply Scholar and book in Newgate, Mrs. Fry! Well! Heaven forbid that I should discommend The gratis, charitable, jail-endeavour! When all persuasions in your praises blend— The Methodist's creed and cry are, Fry for ever! No—I will be your friend—and, like a friend, Point out your very worst defect—Nay, never Start at that word!—But I must ask you why You keep your school in Newgate, Mrs. Fry? Too well I know the price our mother Eve Paid for her schooling: but must all her daughters Commit a petty larceny, and thieve— Pay down a crime for “entrance” to your “quarters?” Your classes may increase, but I must grieve Over your pupils at their bread-and-waters! Oh, tho' it cost you rent—(and rooms run high!) Keep your school out of Newgate, Mrs. Fry! O save the vulgar soul before it's spoil'd! Set up your mounted sign without the gate— And there inform the mind before 'tis soil'd! 'Tis sorry writing on a greasy slate! Nay, if you would not have your labours foil'd, Take it inclining tow'rds a virtuous state, Not prostrate and laid flat—else, woman meek! The upright pencil will but hop and shriek! Ah, who can tell how hard it is to drain The evil spirit from the heart it preys in,— To bring sobriety to life again, Choked with the vile Anacreontic raisin,— To wash Black Betty when her black's ingrain,— To stick a moral lacquer on Moll Brazen, Of Suky Tawdry's habits to deprive her; To tame the wild-fowl-ways of Jenny Diver! Ah, who can tell how hard it is to teach Miss Nancy Dawson on her bed of straw— To make Long Sal sew up the endless breach She made in manners—to write heaven's own law On hearts of granite.—Nay, how hard to preach, In cells, that are not memory's—to draw The moral thread, thro' the immoral eye Of blunt Whitechapel natures, Mrs. Fry! In vain you teach them baby-work within: 'Tis but a clumsy botchery of crime; 'Tis but a tedious darning of old sin— Come out yourself, and stitch up souls in time— It is too late for scouring to begin When virtue's ravell'd out, when all the prime Is worn away, and nothing sound remains; You'll fret the fabric out before the stains! I like your chocolate, good Mistress Fry! I like your cookery in every way; I like your shrove-tide service and supply; I like to hear your sweet Pandeans play; I like the pity in your full-brimm'd eye; I like your carriage, and your silken grey, Your dove-like habits, and your silent preaching; But I don't like your Newgatory teaching. Come out of Newgate, Mrs. Fry! Repair Abroad, and find your pupils in the streets. O, come abroad into the wholesome air, And take your moral place, before Sin seats Her wicked self in the Professor's chair. Suppose some morals raw! the true receipt's To dress them in the pan, but do not try To cook them in the fire, good Mrs. Fry! Put on your decent bonnet, and come out! Good lack! the ancients did not set up schools In jail—but at the Porch! hinting, no doubt, That Vice should have a lesson in the rules Before 'twas whipt by law.—O come about, Good Mrs. Fry! and set up forms and stools All down the Old Bailey, and thro' Newgate-street. But not in Mr. Wontner's proper seat! Teach Lady Barrymore, if, teaching, you That peerless Peeress can absolve from dolour; Teach her it is not virtue to pursue Ruin of blue, or any other colour; Teach her it is not Virtue's crown to rue, Month after month, the unpaid drunken dollar; Teach her that “flooring Charleys” is a game Unworthy one that bears a Christian name. O come and teach our children—that ar'n't ours— That heaven's straight pathway is a narrow way, Not Broad St. Giles's, where fierce Sin devours Children, like Time—or rather they both prey On youth together—meanwhile Newgate low'rs Ev'n like a black cloud at the close of day, To shut them out from any more blue sky: Think of these hopeless wretches, Mrs. Fry! You are not nice—go into their retreats, And make them Quakers, if you will.—'Twere best They wore straight collars, and their shirts sans pleats; That they had hats with brims,—that they were drest In garbs without lappels—than shame the streets With so much raggedness.—You may invest Much cash this way—but it will cost its price, To give a good, round, real cheque to Vice! In brief,—Oh teach the child its moral rote, Not in the way from which 'twill not depart,— But out—out—out! Oh, bid it walk remote! And if the skies are closed against the smart, Ev'n let him wear the single-breasted coat, For that ensureth singleness of heart.— Do what you will, his every want supply, Keep him—but out of Newgate, Mrs. Fry! ODE TO RICHARD MARTIN, ESQ., M.P. FOR GALWAY. “Martin in this has proved himself a very good man!” —Boxiana. How many sing of wars, Of Greek and Trojan jars— The butcheries of men! The Muse hath a “Perpetual Ruby Pen!” Dabbling with heroes and the blood they spill; But no one sings the man That, like a pelican, Nourishes Pity with his tender Bill! Thou Wilberforce of hacks! Of whites as well as blacks, Pyebald and dapple gray, Chesnut and bay— No poet's eulogy thy name adorns! But oxen, from the fens, Sheep—in their pens, Praise thee, and red cows with their winding horns! Thou art sung on brutal pipes! Drovers may curse thee, Knackers asperse thee, And sly M.P.'s bestow their cruel wipes; But the old horse neighs thee, And zebras praise thee,— Asses, I mean—that have as many stripes! Hast thou not taught the Drover to forbear, In Smithfield's muddy, murderous, vile environ,— Staying his lifted bludgeon in the air! Bullocks don't wear Oxide of iron! The cruel Jarvy thou hast summon'd oft, Enforcing mercy on the coarse Yahoo, That thought his horse the courser of the two— Whilst Swift smiled down aloft!— O worthy pair! for this, when he inhabit Bodies of birds—(if so the spirit shifts From flesh to feather)—when the clown uplifts His hand against the sparrow's nest, to grab it,— He shall not harm the Martins and the Swifts! Ah! when Dean Swift was quick, how he enhanced The horse!—and humbled biped man like Plato! But now he's dead, the charger is mischanced— Gone backward in the world—and not advanced,— Remember Cato! Swift was the horse's champion—not the King's, Whom Southey sings, Mounted on Pegasus—would he were thrown! He'll wear that ancient hackney to the bone, Like a mere clothes-horse airing royal things! Ah well-a-day! the ancients did not use Their steeds so cruelly!—let it debar men From wanton rowelling and whip's abuse— Look at the ancients' Muse! Look at their Carmen! O, Martin! how thine eye— That one would think had put aside its lashes,— That can't bear gashes Thro' any horse's side, must ache to spy That horrid window fronting Fetter-lane,— For there's a nag the crows have pick'd for victual, Or some man painted in a bloody vein— Gods! is there no Horse-spital! That such raw shows must sicken the humane! Sure Mr. Whittle Loves thee but little, To let that poor horse linger in his pane! O build a Brookes's Theatre for horses! O wipe away the national reproach— And find a decent Vulture for their corses! And in thy funeral track Four sorry steeds shall follow in each coach! Steeds that confess “the luxury of wo!” True mourning steeds, in no extempore black, And many a wretched hack Shall sorrow for thee,—sore with kick and blow And bloody gash—it is the Indian knack— (Save that the savage is his own tormentor)— Banting shall weep too in his sable scarf— The biped woe the quadruped shall enter, And Man and Horse go half and half, As if their griefs met in a common Centaur! ODE TO THE GREAT UNKNOWN. “O breathe not his name!” —Moore. Thou Great Unknown I do not mean Eternity nor Death, That vast incog! For I suppose thou hast a living breath, Howbeit we know not from whose lungs 'tis blown, Thou man of fog! Parent of many children—child of none! Nobody's son! Nobody's daughter—but a parent still! Still but an ostrich parent of a batch Of orphan eggs,—left to the world to hatch. Superlative Nil! A vox and nothing more,—yet not Vauxhall; A head in papers, yet without a curl! Not the Invisible Girl! No hand—but a hand-writing on a wall— A popular nonentity, Still call'd the same,—without identity! A lark, heard out of sight,— A nothing shined upon,—invisibly bright, “Dark with excess of light!” Constable's literary John-a-Nokes— The real Scottish wizard—and not which, Nobody—in a niche; Every one's hoax! Maybe Sir Walter Scott— Perhaps not! Why dost thou so conceal, and puzzle curious folks? Thou,—whom the second-sighted never saw, The Master Fiction of fictitious history! Chief Nong-tong-paw! No mister in the world—and yet all mystery! The “tricksy spirit” of a Scotch Cock Lane— A novel Junius puzzling the world's brain— A man of magic—yet no talisman! A man of clair obscure—not he o' the moon! A star—at noon. A non-descriptus in a caravan, A private—of no corps—a northern light In a dark lantern,—Bogie in a crape— A figure—but no shape; A vizor—and no knight; The real abstract hero of the age; The staple Stranger of the stage; A Some One made in every man's presumption, Frankenstein's monster—but instinct with gumption Another strange state captive in the north, Constable-guarded in an iron mask— Still let me ask, Hast thou no silver platter, No door-plate, or no card—or some such matter, To scrawl a name upon, and then cast forth? Thou Scottish Barmecide, feeding the hunger Of Curiosity with airy gammon! Thou mystery—monger, Dealing it out like middle cut of salmon, That people buy, and can't make head or tail of it; (Howbeit that puzzle never hurts the sale of it;) Thou chief of authors mystic and abstractical, That lay their proper bodies on the shelf— Keeping thyself so truly to thyself, Thou Zimmerman made practical! Thou secret fountain of a Scottish style, That, like the Nile, Hideth its source wherever it is bred, But still keeps disemboguing (Not disembroguing) Thro' such broad sandy mouths without a head Thou disembodied author—not yet dead,— The whole world's literary Absentee! Ah! wherefore hast thou fled, Thou learned Nemo—wise to a degree, Anonymous L. L. D.! Thou nameless captain of the nameless gang That do—and inquests cannot say who did it! Wert thou at Mrs. Donatty's death-pang? Hast thou made gravy of Weare's watch—or hid it? Hast thou a Blue-Beard chamber? Heaven forbid it! I should be very loth to see thee hang! I hope thou hast an alibi well plann'd, An innocent, altho' an ink-black hand. Tho' thou hast newly turn'd thy private bolt on The curiosity of all invaders— I hope thou art merely closeted with Colton, Who knows a little of the Holy Land, Writing thy next new novel—The Crusaders! Perhaps thou wert even born To be Unknown.—Perhaps hung, some foggy morn, At Captain Coram's charitable wicket, Pinn'd to a ticket That Fate had made illegible, foreseeing The future great unmentionable being.— Perhaps thou hast ridden A scholar poor on St. Augustine's Back, Like Chatterton, and found a dusty pack Of Rowley novels in an old chest hidden; A little hoard of clever simulation, That took the town—and Constable has bidden Some hundred pounds for a continuation— To keep and clothe thee in genteel starvation. I liked thy Waverly—first of thy breeding; I like its modest “sixty years ago,” As if it was not meant for ages' reading. I don't like Ivanhoe, Tho' Dymoke does—it makes him think of clattering In iron overalls before the king, Secure from battering, to ladies flattering, Tuning his challenge to the gauntlets' ring— Oh better far than all that anvil clang It was to hear thee touch the famous string Of Robin Hood's tough bow and make it twang, Rousing him up, all verdant, with his clan, Like Sagittarian Pan! I like Guy Mannering—but not that sham son Of Brown.—I like that literary Sampson, Nine-tenths a Dyer, with a smack of Porson. I like Dick Hatteraick, that rough sea Orson That slew the Gauger; And Dandie Dinmont, like old Ursa Major; And Merrilies, young Bertram's old defender, That Scottish Witch of Endor, That doom'd thy fame. She was the Witch, I take it, To tell a great man's fortune—or to make it! I like thy Antiquary. With his fit on, He makes me think of Mr. Britton, Who has—or had—within his garden wall, A miniature Stone Henge, so very small The sparrows find it difficult to sit on; And Dousterswivel, like Poyais' M'Gregor; And Edie Ochiltree, that old Blue Beggar, Painted so cleverly, I think thou surely knowest Mrs. Beverly! I like thy Barber—him that fired the Beacon— But that's a tender subject now to speak on! I like long-arm'd Rob Roy.—His very charms Fashion'd him for renown!—In sad sincerity, The man that robs or writes must have long arms, If he's to hand his deeds down to posterity! Witness Miss Biffin's posthumous prosperity, Her poor brown crumpled mummy (nothing more) Bearing the name she bore, A thing Time's tooth is tempted to destroy! But Roys can never die—why else, in verity, Is Paris echoing with “Vive le Roy!” Aye, Rob shall live again, and deathless Di— (Vernon, of course) shall often live again— Whilst there's a stone in Newgate, or a chain, Who can pass by Nor feel the Thief's in prison and at hand? There be Old Bailey Jarvies on the stand! I like thy Landlord's Tales!—I like that Idol Of love and Lammermoor—the blue-eyed maid That led to church the mounted cavalcade, And then pull'd up with such a bloody bridal! Throwing equestrian Hymen on his haunches— I like the family—(not silver) branches That hold the tapers To light the serious legend of Montrose.— I like M'Aulay's second-sighted vapours, As if he could not walk or talk alone, Without the devil—or the Great Unknown,— Dalgetty is the nearest of Ducrows! I like St. Leonard's Lily—drench'd with dew! I like thy Vision of the Covenanters, That bloody-minded Graham shot and slew. I like the battle lost and won, The hurly burly's bravely done, The warlike gallops and the warlike canters! I like that girded chieftain of the ranters, Ready to preach down heathens, or to grapple, With one eye on his sword, And one upon the Word,— How he would cram the Caledonian Chapel! I like stern Claverhouse, though he doth dapple His raven steed with blood of many a corse— I like dear Mrs. Headrigg, that unravels Her texts of scripture on a trotting horse— She is so like Rae Wilson when he travels! I like thy Kenilworth—but I'm not going To take a Retrospective Re-Review Of all thy dainty novels—merely showing The old familiar faces of a few, The question to renew, How thou canst leave such deeds without a name, Forego the unclaim'd dividends of fame, Forego the smiles of literary houris— Mid Lothian's trump, and Fife's shrill note of praise, And all the Carse of Gowrie's, When thou might'st have thy statue in Cromarty— Or see thy image on Italian trays, Betwixt Queen Caroline and Buonaparté, Be painted by the Titian of R.A.'s, Or vie in sign-boards with the Royal Guelph Perhaps have thy bust set cheek by jowl with Homer's, Perhaps send out plaster proxies of thyself To other Englands with Australian roamers— Mayhap, in Literary Owhyhee Displace the native wooden gods, or be The China-Lar of a Canadian shelf! It is not modesty that bids thee hide— She never wastes her blushes out of sight: It is not to invite The world's decision, for thy fame is tried,— And thy fair deeds are scatter'd far and wide, Even royal heads are with thy readers reckon'd,— From men in trencher caps to trencher scholars In crimson collars, And learned serjeants in the forty-second! Whither by land or sea art thou not beckon'd? Mayhap exported from the Frith of Forth, Defying distance and its dim control; Perhaps read about Stromness, and reckon'd worth A brace of Miltons for capacious soul— Perhaps studied in the whalers, further north, And set above ten Shakspeares near the pole! Oh, when thou writest by Aladdin's lamp, With such a giant genius at command, For ever at thy stamp, To fill thy treasury from Fairy Land, When haply thou might'st ask the pearly hand Of some great British Vizier's eldest daughter, Tho' princes sought her, And lead her in procession hymeneal, Oh, why dost thou remain a Beau Ideal! Why stay, a ghost, on the Lethean Wharf, Envelop'd in Scotch mist and gloomy fogs? Why, but because thou art some puny Dwarf, Some hopeless Imp, like Riquet with the Tuft, Fearing, for all thy wit, to be rebuff'd, Or bullied by our great reviewing Gogs? What in this masquing age Maketh Unknowns so many and so shy? What but the critic's page? One hath a cast, he hides from the world's eye; Another hath a wen,—he won't show where; A third has sandy hair, A hunch upon his back, or legs awry, Things for a vile reviewer to espy! Another hath a mangel-wurzel nose,— Finally, this is dimpled, Like a pale crumpet face, or that is pimpled, Things for a monthly critic to expose— Nay, what is thy own case—that being small, Thou choosest to be nobody at all! Well, thou art prudent, with such puny bones— E'en like Elshender, the mysterious elf, That shadowy revelation of thyself— To build thee a small hut of haunted stones— For certainly the first pernicious man That ever saw thee, would quickly draw thee In some vile literary caravan— Shown for a shilling Would be thy killing, Think of Crachami's miserable span! No tinier frame the tiny spark could dwell in Than there it fell in— But when she felt herself a show—she tried To shrink from the world's eye, poor dwarf! and died! O since it was thy fortune to be born A dwarf on some Scotch Inch, and then to flinch From all the Gog-like jostle of great men, Still with thy small crow pen Amuse and charm thy lonely hours forlorn— Still Scottish story daintily adorn, Be still a shade—and when this age is fled, When we poor sons and daughters of reality Are in our graves forgotten and quite dead, And Time destroys our mottoes of morality— The lithographic hand of Old Mortality Shall still restore thy emblem on the stone, A featureless death's head, And rob Oblivion ev'n of the Unknown! ADDRESS TO MR. DYMOKE, THE CHAMPION OF ENGLAND. “? Arma Virumque cano!” —Virgil. Mr. Dymoke! Sir Knight! if I may be so bold— (I'm a poor simple gentleman just come to town,) Is your armour put by, like the sheep in a fold?— Is your gauntlet ta'en up, which you lately flung down? Are you—who that day rode so mail'd and admired, Now sitting at ease in a library chair? Have you sent back to Astley the war-horse you hired, With a cheque upon Chambers to settle the fare? What's become of the cup? Great tin-plate worker! say! Cup and ball is a game which some people deem fun! Oh; three golden balls haven't lured you to play Rather false, Mr. D., to all pledges but one? How defunct is the show that was chivalry's mimic! The breastplate—the feathers—the gallant array! So fades, so grows dim, and so dies, Mr. Dymoke! The day of brass breeches! as Wordsworth would say! Perchance in some village remote, with a cot, And a cow, and a pig, and a barndoor, and all;— You show to the parish that peace is your lot, And plenty,—though absent from Westminster Hall! And of course you turn every accoutrement now To its separate use, that your wants may be well-met;— You toss in your breastplate your pancakes, and grow A salad of mustard and cress in your helmet. And you delve the fresh earth with your falchion, less bright Since hung up in sloth from its Westminster task;— And you bake your own bread in your tin; and, Sir Knight, Instead of your brow, put your beer in the casque! How delightful to sit by your beans and your peas, With a goblet of gooseberry gallantly clutch'd, And chat of the blood that had deluged the Pleas, And drench'd the King's Bench,—if the glove had been touch'd! If Sir Columbine Daniel, with knightly pretensions, Had snatch'd your “best doe,”—he'd have flooded the floor;— Nor would even the best of his crafty inventions, “Life Preservers,” have floated him out of his gore! Oh, you and your horse! what a couple was there! The man and his backer,—to win a great fight! Though the trumpet was loud,—you'd an undisturb'd air! And the nag snuff'd the feast and the fray sans affright! Yet strange was the course which the good Cato bore When he waddled tail-wise with the cup to his stall;— For though his departure was at the front door, Still he went the back way out of Westminster Hall. He went,—and 'twould puzzle historians to say, When they trust Time's conveyance to carry your mail,— Whether caution or courage inspired him that day, For though he retreated, he never turn'd tail. By my life, he's a wonderful charger!—The best! Though not for a Parthian corps!—yet for you!— Distinguish'd alike at a fray and a feast, What a horse for a grand Retrospective Review! What a creature to keep a hot warrior cool When the sun's in the face, and the shade's far aloof!— What a tailpiece for Bewick!—or piebald for Poole, To bear him in safety from Elliston's hoof! Well! hail to Old Cato! the hero of scenes May Astley or age ne'er his comforts abridge;— Oh, long may he munch Amphitheatre beans, Well “pent up in Utica” over the Bridge! And to you, Mr. Dymoke, Cribb's rival, I keep Wishing all country pleasures, the bravest and best! And oh! when you come to the Hummums to sleep, May you lie “like a warrior taking his rest!” ODE TO JOSEPH GRIMALDI, SENIOR. “This fellow's wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well craves a kind of wit.” Twelfth Night. Joseph! they say thou'st left the stage, To toddle down the hill of life, And taste the flannell'd ease of age, Apart from pantomimic strife— “Retired—[for Young would call it so]— The world shut out”—in Pleasant Row! And hast thou really wash'd at last From each white cheek the red half-moon And all thy public Clownship cast, To play the private Pantaloon? All youth—all ages yet to be Shall have a heavy miss of thee! Thou didst not preach to make us wise— Thou hadst no finger in our schooling— Thou didst not “lure us to the skies”— Thy simple, simple trade was—Fooling! And yet, Heav'n knows! we could—we can Much “better spare a better man!” Oh, had it pleased the gout to take The reverend Croly from the stage, Or Southey, for our quiet's sake, Or Mr. Fletcher, Cupid's sage, Or, damme! namby pamby Pool,— Or any other clown or fool! Go, Dibdin—all that bear the name, Go Byeway Highway man! go! go! Go, Skeffy—man of painted fame, But leave thy partner, painted Joe! I could bear Kirby on the wane, Or Signor Paulo with a sprain! Had Joseph Wilfred Parkins made His grey hairs scarce in private peace— Had Waithman sought a rural shade— Or Cobbett ta'en a turnpike lease— Or Lisle Bowles gone to Balaam Hill— I think I could be cheerful still! Had Medwin left off, to his praise, Dead lion kicking, like—a friend!— Had long, long Irving gone his ways To muse on death at Ponder's End— Or Lady Morgan taken leave Of Letters—still I might not grieve! But, Joseph—everybody's Jo!— Is gone—and grieve I will and must! As Hamlet did for Yorick, so Will I for thee (though not yet dust), And talk as he did when he miss'd The kissing-crust that he had kiss'd! Ah, where is now thy rolling head! Thy winking, reeling, drunken eyes, (As old Catullus would have said,) Thy oven-mouth, that swallow'd pies— Enormous hunger—monstrous drowth!— Thy pockets greedy as thy mouth! Ah, where thy ears, so often cuff'd!— Thy funny, flapping, filching hands!— Thy partridge body, always stuff'd With waifs, and strays, and contrabands!— Thy foot—like Berkeley's Foote—for why? 'Twas often made to wipe an eye! Ah, where thy legs—that witty pair! For “great wits jump”—and so did they! Lord! how they leap'd in lamplight air! Caper'd—and bounced—and strode away!— That years should tame the legs—alack! I've seen spring through an Almanack! But bounds will have their bound—the shocks Of Time will cramp the nimblest toes; And those that frisk'd in silken clocks May look to limp in fleecy hose— One only—(Champion of the ring) Could ever make his Winter,—Spring! And gout, that owns no odds between The toe of Czar and toe of Clown, Will visit—but I did not mean To moralize, though I am grown Thus sad,—Thy going seem'd to beat A muffled drum for Fun's retreat! And, may be—'tis no time to smother A sigh, when two prime wags of London Are gone—thou, Joseph, one,—the other, A Joe!—“sic transit gloria Munden!” A third departure some insist on,— Stage-apoplexy threatens Liston!— Nay, then, let Sleeping Beauty sleep With ancient “Dozey” to the dregs— Let Mother Goose wear mourning deep, And put a hatchment o'er her eggs! Let Farley weep—for Magic's man Is gone—his Christmas Caliban! Let Kemble, Forbes, and Willet rain, As though they walk'd behind thy bier,— For since thou wilt not play again, What matters,—if in heav'n or here! Or in thy grave, or in thy bed!— There's Quick might just as well be dead! Oh, how will thy departure cloud The lamplight of the little breast! The Christmas child will grieve aloud To miss his broadest friend and best,— Poor urchin! what avails to him The cold New Monthly's Ghost of Grimm? For who like thee could ever stride! Some dozen paces to the mile!— The motley, medley coach provide— Or like Joe Frankenstein compile The vegetable man complete!— A proper Covent Garden feat! Oh, who like thee could ever drink, Or eat,—swill—swallow—bolt—and choke! Nod, weep, and hiccup—sneeze and wink?— Thy very yawn was quite a joke! Though Joseph, Junior, acts not ill, “There's no Fool like the old Fool” still! Joseph, farewell! dear funny Joe! We met with mirth,—we part in pain! For many a long, long year must go Ere Fun can see thy like again— For Nature does not keep great stores Of perfect Clowns—that are not Boors! TO SYLVANUS URBAN, ESQ., EDITOR OF THE “GENTLEMAN'S MAGAZINE.” “Dost thou not suspect my years?” Much Ado about Nothing. Oh! Mr. Urban! never must thou lurch A sober age made serious drunk by thee; Hop in thy pleasant way from church to church, And nurse thy little bald Biography. Oh, my Sylvanus! what a heart is thine! And what a page attends thee! Long may I Hang in demure confusion o'er each line That asks thy little questions with a sigh! Old tottering years have nodded to their falls, Like pensioners that creep about and die;— But thou, Old Parr of periodicals, Livest in monthly immortality! How sweet!—as Byron of his infant said,— “Knowledge of objects” in thine eye to trace; To see the mild no-meanings of thy head, Taking a quiet nap upon thy face! How dear through thy Obituary to roam, And not a name of any name to catch! To meet thy Criticism walking home Averse from rows, and never calling “Watch!” Rich is thy page in soporific things,— Composing compositions,—lulling men,— Faded old posies of unburied rings,— Confessions dozing from an opiate pen:— Lives of Right Reverends that have never lived,— Deaths of good people that have really died,— Parishioners,—hatch'd,—husbanded,—and wived,— Bankrupts and Abbots breaking side by side! The sacred query,—the remote response,— The march of serious mind, extremely slow,— The graver's cut at some right agèd sconce, Famous for nothing many years ago! B. asks of C. if Milton e'er did write “Comus,” obscured beneath some Ludlow lid;— And C., next month, an answer doth indite, Informing B. that Mr. Milton did! X. sends the portrait of a genuine flea, Caught upon Martin Luther years agone;— And Mr. Parkes, of Shrewsbury, draws a bee, Long dead, that gather'd honey for King John. There is no end of thee,—there is no end, Sylvanus, of thy A, B, C, D-merits! Thou dost, with alphabets, old walls attend, And poke the letters into holes, like ferrets. Go on, Sylvanus!—Bear a wary eye, The churches cannot yet be quite run out! Some parishes must yet have been pass'd by,— There's Bullock-Smithy has a church no doubt! Go on—and close the eyes of distant ages! Nourish the names of the undoubted dead! So Epicures shall pick thy lobster-pages, Heavy and lively, though but seldom red. Go on! and thrive! Demurest of odd fellows! Bottling up dulness in an ancient binn! Still live! still prose!—continue still to tell us Old truths! no strangers, though we take them in! AN ADDRESS TO THE STEAM WASHING COMPANY. “Archer. How many are there, Scrub?Scrub. Five-and-forty, sir.” —Beaux Stratagem. “For shame—let the linen alone!” —Merry Wives of Windsor. Mr. Scrub—Mr. Slop—or whoever you be! The Cock of Steam Laundries,—the head Patentee Of Associate Cleansers,—Chief founder and prime Of the firm for the wholesale distilling of grime— Co-partners and dealers, in linen's propriety— That make washing public—and wash in society— O lend me your ear! if that ear can forego For a moment the music that bubbles below,— From your new Surrey Geysers all foaming and hot,— That soft “simmer's sang” so endear'd to the Scot— If your hands may stand still, or your steam without danger— If your suds will not cool, and a mere simple stranger, Both to you and to washing, may put in a rub,— O wipe out your Amazon arms from the tub,— And lend me your ear,—Let me modestly plead For a race that your labours may soon supersede— For a race that, now washing no living affords— Like Grimaldi must leave their aquatic old boards, Not with pence in their pockets to keep them at ease, Not with bread in the funds—or investments of cheese, But to droop like sad willows that lived by a stream, Which the sun has suck'd up into vapour and steam. Ah, look at the laundress, before you begrudge Her hard daily bread to that laudable drudge— When chanticleer singeth his earliest matins, She slips her amphibious feet in her pattens, And beginneth her toil while the morn is still grey, As if she was washing the night into day— Not with sleeker or rosier fingers Aurora Beginneth to scatter the dewdrops before her; Not Venus that rose from the billow so early, Look'd down on the foam with a forehead more pearly— Her head is involved in an aërial mist, And a bright-beaded bracelet encircles her wrist; Her visage glows warm with the ardour of duty; She's Industry's moral—she's all moral beauty! Growing brighter and brighter at every rub— Would any man ruin her?—No, Mr. Scrub! No man that is manly would work her mishap— No man that is manly would covet her cap— Nor her apron—her hose—nor her gown made of stuff— Nor her gin—nor her tea—nor her wet pinch of snuff! Alas! so she thought—but that slippery hope Has betray'd her—as though she had trod on her soap! And she,—whose support,—like the fishes that fly, Was to have her fins wet, must now drop from her sky— She whose living it was, and a part of her fare, To be damp'd once a day, like the great white sea bear, With her hands like a sponge, and her head like a mop— Quite a living absorbent that revell'd in slop— She that paddled in water, must walk upon sand, And sigh for her deeps like a turtle on land! Lo, then, the poor laundress, all wretched she stands, Instead of a counterpane, wringing her hands! All haggard and pinch'd, going down in life's vale, With no faggot for burning, like Allan-a-Dale! No smoke from her flue—and no steam from her pane, Where once she watch'd heaven, fearing God and the rain— Or gazed o'er her bleach-field so fairly engross'd, Till the lines wander'd idle from pillar to post! Ah, where are the playful young pinners—ah, where The harlequin quilts that cut capers in air— The brisk waltzing stockings—the white and the black, That danced on the tight-rope, or swung on the slack— The light sylph-like garments, so tenderly pinn'd, That blew into shape, and embodied the wind! There was white on the grass—there was white on the spray— Her garden—it look'd like a garden of May! But now all is dark—not a shirt's on a shrub— You've ruin'd her prospects in life, Mr. Scrub! You've ruin'd her custom—now families drop her— From her silver reduced—nay, reduced from her copper! The last of her washing is done at her eye, One poor little kerchief that never gets dry! From mere lack of linen she can't lay a cloth, And boils neither barley nor alkaline broth,— But her children come round her as victuals grow scant, And recal, with foul faces, the source of their want— When she thinks of their poor little mouths to be fed, And then thinks of her trade that is utterly dead, And even its pearlashes laid in the grave— Whilst her tub is a-dry-rotting, stave after stave, And the greatest of Coopers, ev'n he that they dub Sir Astley, can't bind up her heart or her tub,— Need you wonder she curses your bones, Mr. Scrub! Need you wonder, when steam has deprived her of bread, If she prays that the evil may visit your head— Nay, scald all the heads of your Washing Committee,— If she wishes you all the soot blacks of the City— In short, not to mention all plagues without number, If she wishes you all in the Wash at the Humber! Ah, perhaps, in some moment of drowth and despair, When her linen got scarce, and her washing grew rare— When the sum of her suds might be summ'd in a bowl, And the rusty cold iron quite enter'd her soul— When, perhaps, the last glance of her wandering eye Had caught “the Cock Laundresses' Coach” going by, Or her lines that hung idle, to waste the fine weather, And she thought of her wrongs and her rights both together, In a lather of passion that froth'd as it rose, Too angry for grammar, too lofty for prose, On her sheet—if a sheet were still left her—to write, Some remonstrance like this then, perchance, saw the light— LETTER OF REMONSTRANCE FROM BRIDGET JONES TO THE NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMEN FORMING THE WASHING COMMITTEE. It's a shame, so it is—men can't Let alone Jobs as is Woman's right to do—and go about there Own— Theirs Reforms enuff Alreddy without your new schools For washing to sit Up,—and push the Old Tubs from their stools! But your just like the Raddicals,—for upsetting of the Sudds When the world wagg'd well enuff—and Wommen wash'd your old dirty duds, I'm Certain sure Enuff your Ann Sisters had no steam Indins, that's Flat,— But I Warrant your Four Fathers went as Tidy and gentlemanny for all that— I suppose your the Family as lived in the Great Kittle I see on Clapham Commun, some times a very considerable period back when I were little, And they Said it went with Steem,—But that was a joke! For I never see none come of it,—that's out of it—but only sum Smoak— And for All your Power of Horses about your Indians you never had but Two In my time to draw you About to Fairs—and hang you, you know that's true! And for All your fine Perspectuses,—howsomever you bewhich 'em, Theirs as Pretty ones off Primerows Hill, as ever a one at Mitchum, Thof I cant sea What Prospectives and washing has with one another to Do— It ant as if a Bird'seye Hankicher can take a Birds-high view! But Thats your look-out—I've not much to do with that— But pleas God to hold up fine, Id show you caps and pinners and small things as lillywhit as Ever crosst the Line Without going any Father off then Little Parodies Place, And Thats more than you Can—and Ill say it behind your face— But when Folks talks of washing, it ant for you too Speak,— As kept Dockter Pattyson out of his Shirt for a Weak! Thinks I, when I heard it—Well thear's a Pretty go! That comes o' not marking of things or washing out the marks, and Huddling 'em up so! Till Their frends comes and owns them, like drownded corpeses in a Vault, But may Hap you havint Larn'd to spel—and That ant your Fault, Only you ought to leafe the Linnins to them as has Larn'd,— For if it warnt for Washing,—and whare Bills is concarnd, What's the Yuse, of all the world, for a Wommans Headication, And Their Being maid Schollards of Sundays—fit for any Cityation? Well, what I says is this—when every Kittle has its spout, Theirs no nead for Companys to puff steam about! To be sure its very Well, when Their ant enuff Wind For blowing up Boats with,—but not to hurt human kind, Like that Pearkins with his Blunderbush, that's loaded with hot water, Thof a xSherrif might know Better, than make things for slaughtter, As if War warnt Cruel enuff—wherever it befalls, Without shooting poor sogers, with sich scalding hot washing balls,— But thats not so Bad as a Sett of Bear Faced Scrubbs As joins their Sopes together, and sits up Steam rubbing Clubs, For washing Dirt Cheap,—and eating other Peple's grubs! Which is all verry Fine for you and your Patent Tea, But I wonders How Poor Wommen is to get Their Beau-He! They must drink Hunt wash (the only wash God nose there will be!) And their Little drop of Somethings as they takes for their Goods, When you and your Steam has ruined (G?d forgive mee) their lively Hoods, Poor Women as was born to Washing in their youth! And now must go and Larn other Buisnesses Four Sooth! But if so be They leave their Lines what are they to go at— They won't do for Angell's—nor any Trade like That, Nor we cant Sow Babby Work,—for that's all Bespoke,— For the Queakers in Bridle! and a vast of the confind Folk Do their own of Themselves—even the bettermost of em-aye, and evn them of middling degrees— Why—Lauk help you—Babby Linen ant Bread and Cheese! Nor we can't go a hammering the roads into Dust, But we must all go and be Bankers, Like Mr. Marshes and Mr. Chamber, and that's what we must! God nose you oght to have more Concern for our Sects, When you nose you have suck'd us and hanged round our Mutherly necks, And remembers what you Owes to Wommen Besides washing— You ant, blame you, like Men to go a slushing and sloshing In mob caps, and pattins, adoing of Females Labers And prettily jear'd At, you great Horse God-meril things, ant you now by your next door nayhbours— Lawk, I thinks I see you with your Sleaves tuckt up No more like Washing than is drownding of a Pupp— And for all Your Fine Water Works going round and round They'll scruntch your Bones some day—I'll be bound And no more nor be a gudgement,—for it cant come to good To sit up agin Providince, which your a doing,—nor not fit It should, For man warnt maid for Wommens starvation, Nor to do away Laundrisses as is Links of Creation— And cant be dun without in any Country But a naked Hot-tinpot Nation. Ah, I wish our Minister would take one of your Tubbs And preach a Sermon in it, and give you some good rubs— But I warrants you reads (for you cant spel we nose) nyther Bybills or Good Tracks, Or youd no better than Taking the Close off one's Backs— And let your neighbours Oxin an Asses alone,— And every Thing thats hern,—and give every one their Hone! Well, its God for us All, and every Washer Wommen for herself, And so you might, without shoving any on us off the shelf, But if you warnt Noddis youd Let wommen a-be And pull off your Pattins,—and leave the washing to we That nose what's what—Or mark what I say, Youl make a fine Kittle of fish of Your Close some Day— When the Aulder men wants Their Bibs and their ant nun at all, And Crismass cum—and never a Cloth to lay in Gild Hall, Or send a damp shirt to his Woship the Mare Till hes rumatiz Poor Man, and cant set uprite to do good in his Harm Chare— Besides Miss-Matching Larned Ladys Hose, as is sent for you not to wash (for you dont wash) but to stew And make Peples Stockins yeller as oght to be Blew, With a vast more like That,—and all along of Steem Which warnt meand by Nater for any sich skeam— But thats your Losses and youl have to make It Good, And I cant say I'm sorry, afore God, if you shoud, For men mought Get their Bread a great many ways Without taking ourn,—aye, and Moor to your Prays, If You Was even to Turn Dust Men a dry sifting Dirt, But you oughtint to Hurt Them as never Did You no Hurt! Yourn with Anymocity, Bridget Jones. ODE TO CAPTAIN PARRY. “By the North Pole I do challenge thee!” Love's Labour's Lost. Parry, my man! has thy brave leg Yet struck its foot against the peg On which the world is spun? Or hast thou found No Thoroughfare Writ by the hand of Nature there Where man has never run? Hast thou yet traced the Great Unknown Of channels in the Frozen Zone Or held at Icy Bay, Hast thou still miss'd the proper track For homeward Indian men that lack A bracing by the way? Still hast thou wasted toil and trouble On nothing but the North-Sea Bubble Of geographic scholar? Or found new ways for ships to shape, Instead of winding round the Cape, A short cut through the collar! Hast found the way that sighs were sent to The Pole—though God knows whom they went to! That track reveal'd to Pope— Or if the Arctic waters sally, Or terminate in some blind alley, A chilly path to grope? Alas! though Ross, in love with snows, Has painted them couleur de rose, It is a dismal doom, As Claudio saith, to Winter thrice, “In regions of thick-ribbèd ice”— All bright,—and yet all gloom! 'Tis well for Gheber souls that sit Before the fire and worship it With pecks of Wallsend coals, With feet upon the fender's front, Roasting their corns—like Mr. Hunt— To speculate on poles. 'Tis easy for our Naval Board— 'Tis easy for our Civic Lord Of London and of ease, That lies in ninety feet of down, With fur on his nocturnal gown, To talk of Frozen Seas! 'Tis fine for Monsieur Ude to sit, And prate about the mundane spit, And babble of Cook's track— He'd roast the leather off his toes, Ere he would trudge through polar snows. To plant a British Jack! Oh, not the proud licentious great, That travel on a carpet skate, Can value oils like thine! What 'tis to take a Hecla range, Through ice unknown to Mrs. Grange, And alpine lumps of brine! But we, that mount the Hill o' Rhyme, Can tell how hard it is to climb The lofty slippery steep. Ah! there are more Snow Hills than that Which doth black Newgate, like a hat, Upon its forehead, keep. Perchance thou'rt now—while I am writing— Feeling a bear's wet grinder biting About thy frozen spine! Or thou thyself art eating whale, Oily, and underdone, and stale, That, haply, cross'd thy line! But I'll not dream such dreams of ill— Rather will I believe thee still Safe cellar'd in the snow,— Reciting many a gallant story Of British kings and British glory, To crony Esquimaux— Cheering that dismal game where Night Makes one slow move from black to white Through all the tedious year,— Or smitten by some fond frost fair, That comb'd out crystals from her hair, Wooing a seal-skin dear! So much a long communion tends, As Byron says, to make us friends With what we daily view— God knows the daintiest taste may come To love a nose that's like a plum In marble, cold and blue! To dote on hair, an oily fleece! As though it hung from Helen o' Greece— They say that love prevails Ev'n in the veriest polar land— And surely she may steal thy hand That used to steal thy nails! But ah, ere thou art fixt to marry, And take a polar Mrs. Parry, Think of a six months' gloom— Think of the wintry waste, and hers, Each furnish'd with a dozen furs, Think of thine icy dome! Think of the children born to blubber! Ah me! hast thou an Indian rubber Inside!—to hold a meal For months,—about a stone and half Of whale, and part of a sea calf— A fillet of salt veal!— Some walrus ham—no trifle but A decent steak—a solid cut Of seal—no wafer slice! A reindeer's tongue and drink beside! Gallons of sperm—not rectified! And pails of water-ice! Oh, canst thou fast and then feast thus? Still come away, and teach to us Those blessed alternations— To-day, to run our dinners fine, To feed on air and then to dine With Civic Corporations— To save th' Old Bailey daily shilling, And then to take a half-year's filling In P.N.'s pious Row— When ask'd to hock and haunch o' ven'son, Through something we have worn our pens on For Longman and his Co. O come and tell us what the Pole is— Whether it singular and sole is,— Or straight, or crooked bent,— If very thick or very thin,— Made of what wood—and if akin To those there be in Kent? There's Combe, there's Spurzheim, and there's Gall, Have talk'd of poles—yet, after all, What has the public learn'd? And Hunt's account must still defer,— He sought the poll at Westminster— And is not yet return'd! Alvanly asks if whist, dear soul, Is play'd in snow towns near the Pole, And how the fur-man deals? And Eldon doubts if it be true, That icy Chancellors really do Exist upon the seals? Barrow, by well-fed office-grates, Talks of his own bechristen'd Straits, And longs that he were there; And Croker, in his cabriolet, Sighs o'er his brown horse, at his Bay, And pants to cross the mer! O come away, and set us right, And, haply, throw a northern light On questions such as these:— Whether, when this drown'd world was lost, The surflux waves were lock'd in frost, And turn'd to Icy Seas? Is Ursa Major white or black? Or do the Polar tribes attack Their neighbours—and what for? Whether they ever play at cuffs, And then, if they take off their muffs In pugilistic war? Tell us, is Winter champion there, As in our milder fighting air? Say, what are Chilly loans? What cures they have for rheums beside, And if their hearts get ossified From eating bread of bones? Whether they are such dwarfs—the quicker To circulate the vital liquor,— And then, from head to heel— How short the Methodists must choose Their dumpy envoys not to lose Their toes in spite of zeal? Whether 'twill soften or sublime it To preach of Hell in such a climate— Whether may Wesley hope To win their souls—or that old function Of seals—with the extreme of unction— Bespeaks them for the Pope? Whether the lamps will e'er be “learn'd” Where six months' “midnight oil” is burn'd, Or letters must defer With people that have never conn'd An A. B. C, but live beyond The Sound of Lancaster! O come away at any rate— Well hast thou earn'd a downier state, With all thy hardy peers— Good lack, thou must be glad to smell dock, And rub thy feet with opodeldoc, After such frosty years. Mayhap, some gentle dame at last, Smit by the perils thou hast pass'd, However coy before, Shall bid thee now set up thy rest In that Brest Harbour, woman's breast, And tempt the Fates no more! ODE TO R. W. ELLISTON, ESQ., THE GREAT LESSEE! “Rover. Do you know, you villain, that I am this moment the greatest man living?” —Wild Oats. Oh! Great Lessee! Great Manager! Great Man! Oh, Lord High Elliston! Immortal Pan Of all the pipes that play in Drury Lane! Macready's master! Westminster's high Dane (As Galway Martin, in the House's walls, Hamlet and Doctor Ireland justly calls) Friend to the sweet and ever-smiling Spring! Magician of the lamp and prompter's ring! Drury's Aladdin! Whipper-in of actors! Kicker of rebel preface-malefactors! Glass-blowers' corrector! King of the cheque-taker! At once Great Leamington and Winston-Maker! Dramatic Bolter of plain Bunns and cakes! In silken hose the most reform'd of Rakes! Oh, Lord High Elliston! lend me an ear! (Poole is away, and Williams shall keep clear) While I, in little slips of prose, not verse, Thy splendid course, as pattern-work, rehearse! Bright was thy youth—thy manhood brighter still— The greatest Romeo upon Holborn Hill— Lightest comedian of the pleasant day, When Jordan threw her sunshine o'er a play! But these, though happy, were but subject times, And no man cares for bottom-steps, that climbs— Far from my wish it is to stifle down The hours that saw thee snatch the Surrey crown! Though now thy hand a mightier sceptre wields, Fair was thy reign in sweet St. George's Fields. Dibdin was Premier—and a Golden Age For a short time enrich'd the subject stage. Thou hadst, than other Kings, more peace-and-plenty; Ours but one Bench could boast, but thou hadst twenty; But the times changed—and Booth-acting no more Drew Rulers' shillings to the gallery door. Thou didst, with bag and baggage, wander thence, Repentant, like thy neighbour Magdalens! Next, the Olympic Games were tried, each feat Practised the most bewitching in Wych Street. Charles had his royal ribaldry restored, And in a downright neighbourhood drank and whored; Rochester there in dirty ways again Revell'd—and lived once more in Drury Lane: But thou, R. W.! kept thy moral ways, Pit-lecturing 'twixt the farces and the plays, A lamplight Irving to the butcher-boys That soil'd the benches and that made a noise:— “You,—in the back!—can scarcely hear a line! Down from those benches—butchers—they are mine!” Lastly—and thou wert built for it by nature!— Crown'd was thy head in Drury Lane Theatre! Gentle George Robins saw that it was good, And renters cluck'd around thee in a brood. King thou wert made of Drury and of Kean! Of many a lady and of many a Quean! With Poole and Larpent was thy reign begun— But now thou turnest from the Dead and Dun, Hook's in thine eye, to write thy plays, no doubt, And Colman lives to cut the damnlets out! Oh, worthy of the house! the King's commission! Isn't thy condition “a most bless'd condition?” Thou reignest over Winston, Kean, and all The very lofty and the very small— Showest the plumbless Bunn the way to kick— Keepest a Williams for thy veriest stick— Seest a Vestris in her sweetest moments. Without the danger of newspaper comments— Tellest Macready, as none dared before, Thine open mind from the half-open door!— (Alas! I fear he has left Melpomene's crown, To be a Boniface in Buxton town!)— Thou holdst the watch, as half-price people know, And callest to them, to a moment,—“Go?” Teachest the sapient Sapio how to sing— Hangest a cat most oddly by the wing— Hast known the length of a Cubitt-foot—and kiss'd The pearly whiteness of a Stephen's wrist— Kissing and pitying—tender and humane! “By heaven she loves me! Oh, it is too plain!” A sigh like this thy trembling passion slips, Dimpling the warm Madeira at thy lips! Go on, Lessee! Go on, and prosper well! Fear not, though forty glass-blowers should rebel— Show them how thou hast long befriended them, And teach Dubois their treason to condemn! Go on! addressing pits in prose and worse! Be long, be slow, be anything but terse— Kiss to the gallery the hand that's gloved— Make Bunn the Great, and Winston the Beloved, Go on—and but in this reverse the thing, Walk backward with wax lights before the King— Go on! Spring ever in thine eye! Go on! Hope's favourite child! ethereal Elliston! ADDRESS TO MARIA DARLINGTON ON HER RETURN TO THE STAGE. “It was Maria!— And better fate did Maria deserve than to have her banns forbid— She had, since that, she told me, strayed as far as Rome, and walked round St. Peter's once—and returned back—.” See the whole story in Sterne and the newspapers. Thou art come back again to the stage Quite as blooming as when thou didst leave it; And 'tis well for this fortunate age That thou didst not, by going off, grieve it! It is pleasant to see thee again— Right pleasant to see thee, by Herclé, Unmolested by pea-colour'd Hayne! And free from that thou-and-thee Berkeley! Thy sweet foot, my Foote, is as light (Not my Foote—I speak by correction) As the snow on some mountain at night, Or the snow that has long on thy neck shone. The Pit is in raptures to free thee, The Boxes impatient to greet thee, The Galleries quite clam'rous to see thee, And thy scenic relations to meet thee! Ah, where was thy sacred retreat? Maria! ah, where hast thou been, With thy two little wandering Feet, Far away from all peace and pea-green! Far away from Fitzhardinge the bold, Far away from himself and his lot! I envy the place thou hast stroll'd, If a stroller thou art—which thou'rt not! Sterne met thee, poor wandering thing, Methinks, at the close of the day— When thy Billy had just slipp'd his string, And thy little dog quite gone astray— He bade thee to sorrow no more— He wish'd thee to lull thy distress In his bosom—he couldn't do more, And a Christian could hardly do less! Ah, me! for thy small plaintive pipe, I fear we must look at thine eye— That eye—forced so often to wipe That the handkerchief never got dry! Oh sure 'tis a barbarous deed To give pain to the feminine mind— But the wooer that left thee to bleed Was a creature more killing than kind! The man that could tread on a worm Is a brute—and inhuman to boot; But he merits a much harsher term That can wantonly tread on a Foote! Soft mercy and gentleness blend To make up a Quaker—but he That spurn'd thee could scarce be a Friend, Though he dealt in that Thou-ing of thee! They that loved thee, Maria, have flown! The friends of the midsummer hour! But those friends now in anguish atone, And mourn o'er thy desolate bow'r. Friend Hayne, the Green Man, is quite out, Yea, utterly out of his bias; And the faithful Fitzhardinge, no doubt, Is counting his Ave Marias! Ah, where wast thou driven away, To feast on thy desolate woe? We have witness'd thy weeping in play, But none saw the earnest tears flow— Perchance thou wert truly forlorn,— Though none but the fairies could mark Where they hung upon some Berkeley thorn, Or the thistles in Burderop Park! Ah, perhaps, when old age's white snow Has silver'd the crown of Hayne's nob— For even the greenest will grow As hoary as “White-headed Bob—” He'll wish, in the days of his prime, He had been rather kinder to one He hath left to the malice of Time— A woman—so weak and undone! ODE TO W. KITCHENER, M.D., AUTHOR OF “THE COOK'S ORACLE,” “OBSERVATIONS ON VOCAL MUSIC,” “THE ART OF INVIGORATING AND PROLONGING LIFE,” “PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS ON TELESCOPES, OPERA-GLASSES, AND SPECTACLES,” “THE HOUSEKEEPER'S LEDGER,” AND “THE PLEASURE OF MAKING A WILL.” “I rule the roast, as Milton says!” —Caleb Quotem. Hail! multifarious man! Thou Wondrous, Admirable Kitchen Crichton! Born to enlighten The laws of Optics, Peptics, Music, Cooking— Master of the Piano—and the Pan— As busy with the kitchen as the skies! Now looking At some rich stew through Galileo's eyes,— Or boiling eggs—timed to a metronome— As much at home In spectacles as in mere isinglass— In the art of frying brown—as a digression On music and poetical expression,— Whereas, how few, of all our cooks, alas! Could tell Calliope from “Calipee!” How few there be Could cleave the lowest for the highest stories, (Observatories,) And turn, like thee, Diana's calculator, However cook's synonymous with Kater! Alas! still let me say, How few could lay The carving knife beside the tuning fork, Like the proverbial Jack ready for any work! Oh, to behold thy features in thy book! Thy proper head and shoulders in a plate, How it would look! With one raised eye watching the dial's date, And one upon the roast, gently cast down— Thy chops—done nicely brown— The garnish'd brow—with “a few leaves of bay”— The hair—“done Wiggy's way!” And still one studious finger near thy brains, As if thou wert just come From editing of some New soup—or hashing Dibdin's cold remains! Or, Orpheus-like,—fresh from thy dying strains Of music,—Epping luxuries of sound, As Milton says, “in many a bout Of linkëd sweetness long drawn out,” While all thy tame stuff'd leopards listen'd round! Oh, rather thy whole proper length reveal, Standing like Fortune,—on the jack—thy wheel. (Thou art, like Fortune, full of chops and changes, Thou hast a fillet too before thine eye!) Scanning our kitchen, and our vocal ranges, As though it were the same to sing or fry— Nay, so it is—hear how Miss Paton's throat Makes “fritters” of a note! And is not reading near akin to feeding, Or why should Oxford Sausages be fit Receptacles for wit? Or why should Cambridge put its little, smart, Minced brains into a Tart? Nay, then, thou wert but wise to frame receipts, Book-treats, Equally to instruct the Cook and cram her— Receipts to be devour'd, as well as read, The Culinary Art in gingerbread— The Kitchen's Eaten Grammar! Oh, very pleasant is thy motley page— Aye, very pleasant in its chatty vein— So—in a kitchen—would have talk'd Montaigne, That merry Gascon—humourist, and sage! Let slender minds with single themes engage, Like Mr. Bowles with his eternal Pope,— Or Lovelass upon Wills,—Thou goest on Plaiting ten topics, like Tate Wilkinson! Thy brain is like a rich Kaleidoscope, Stuff'd with a brilliant medley of odd bits, And ever shifting on from change to change, Saucepans—old Songs—Pills—Spectacles—and Spits! Thy range is wider than a Rumford range! Thy grasp a miracle!—till I recall Th' indubitable cause of thy variety— Thou art, of course, th' Epitome of all That spying—frying—singing—mix'd Society Of Scientific Friends, who used to meet Welsh Rabbits—and thyself—in Warren Street! Oh, hast thou still those Conversazioni, Where learnëd visitors discoursed—and fed? There came Belzoni, Fresh from the ashes of Egyptian dead— And gentle Poki—and that Royal Pair, Of whom thou didst declare— “Thanks to the greatest Cooke we ever read— They were—what Sandwiches should be—half bred!” There famed M'Adam from his manual toil Relax'd—and freely own'd he took thy hints On “making Broth with Flints”— There Parry came, and show'd thee polar oil For melted butter—Combe with his medullary Notions about the Skullery, And Mr. Poole, too partial to a broil— There witty Rogers came, that punning elf! Who used to swear thy book Would really look A Delphic “Oracle,” if laid on Delf— There, once a month, came Campbell and discuss'd His own—and thy own—“Magazine of Taste”— There Wilberforce the Just Came, in his old black suit, till once he traced Thy sly advice to Poachers of Black Folks,— That “do not break their yolks,”— Which huff'd him home, in grave disgust and haste! There came John Clare, the poet, nor forbore Thy Patties—thou wert hand-and-glove with Moore, Who call'd thee “Kitchen Addison”—for why? Thou givest rules for Health and Peptic Pills, Forms for made dishes, and receipts for Wills, “Teaching us how to live and how to die!” There came thy Cousin-Cook, good Mrs. Fry— There Trench, the Thames Projector, first brought on His sine Quay non,— There Martin would drop in on Monday eves, Or Fridays, from the pens, and raise his breath 'Gainst cattle days and death,— Answer'd by Mellish, feeder of fat beeves, Who swore that Frenchmen never could be eager For fighting on soup meagre— “And yet (as thou wouldst add) the French have seen A Marshal Tureen!” Great was thy Evening Cluster!—often graced With Dollond—Burgess—and Sir Humphry Davy! Twas there M'Dermot first inclined to Taste,— There Colburn learn'd the art of making paste For puffs—and Accum analysed a gravy. Colman—the Cutter of Coleman Street, 'tis said Came there,—and Parkins with his Ex-wise-head, (His claim to letters)—Kater, too, the Moon's Crony,—and Graham, lofty on balloons,— There Croly stalk'd with holy humour heated, (Who wrote a light-horse play, which Yates completed)— And Lady Morgan, that grinding organ, And Brasbridge telling anecdotes of spoons,— Madame Valbrèque thrice honour'd thee, and came With great Rossini, his own bow and fiddle,— And even Irving spared a night from fame, And talk'd—till thou didst stop him in the middle, To serve round Tewah-diddle! Then all the guests rose up, and sighed good-bye! So let them:—thou thyself art still a Host! Dibdin—Cornaro—Newton—Mrs. Fry! Mrs. Glasse, Mr. Spec!—Lovelass and Weber, Mathews in Quot'em—Moore's fire-worshipping Gheber— Thrice-worthy Worthy! seem by thee engross'd! Howbeit the Peptic Cook still rules the roast, Potent to hush all ventriloquial snarling,— And ease the bosom pangs of indigestion! Thou art, sans question, The Corporation's love—its Doctor Darling! Look at the Civic Palate—nay, the Bed Which set dear Mrs. Opie on supplying “Illustrations of Lying!” Ninety square feet of down from heel to head It measured, and I dread Was haunted by a terrible night Mare, A monstrous burthen on the corporation!— Look at the Bill of Fare for one day's share, Sea-turtles by the score—oxen by droves. Geese, turkeys, by the flock—fishes and loaves Countless, as when the Lilliputian nation Was making up the huge man-mountain's ration! Oh! worthy Doctor! surely thou hast driven The squatting Demon from great Garratt's breast— (His honour seems to rest!—) And what is thy reward?—Hath London given Thee public thanks for thy important service? Alas! not even The tokens it bestow'd on Howe and Jervis!— Yet could I speak as Orators should speak Before the Worshipful the Common Council (Utter my bold bad grammar and pronounce ill,) Thou shouldst not miss thy Freedom for a week, Richly engross'd on vellum:—Reason urges That he who rules our cookery—that he Who edits soups and gravies, ought to be A Citizen, where sauce can make a Burgess! ODE TO H. BODKIN, ESQ., SECRETARY TO THE SOCIETY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF MENDICITY. “This is your charge—you shall comprehend all vagrom men.” Much Ado about Nothing. Hail, King of Shreds and Patches, hail, Disperser of the Poor! Thou Dog in office, set to bark All beggars from the door! Great overseer of overseers, And Dealer in old rags! Thy public duty never fails, Thy ardour never flags! “Oh, when I take my walks abroad, How many Poor”—I miss! Had Doctor Watts walk'd now-a-days He would have written this! So well thy Vagrant-catchers prowl, So clear thy caution keeps The path—O, Bodkin, sure thou hast The eye that never sleeps! No Belisarius pleads for alms, No Benbow, lacking legs; The pious man in black is now The only man that begs! Street-Handels are disorganized, Disbanded every band!— The silent scraper at the door Is scarce allow'd to stand! The Sweeper brushes with his broom, The Carstairs with his chalk Retires,—the Cripple leaves his stand, But cannot sell his walk. The old Wall-blind resigns the wall, The Camels hide their humps, The Witherington without a leg Mayn't beg upon his stumps! Poor Jack is gone, that used to doff His batter'd tatter'd hat, And show his dangling sleeve, alas! There seem'd no 'arm in that! Oh! was it such a sin to air His true blue naval rags, Glory's own trophy, like St. Paul, Hung round with holy flags! Thou knowest best. I meditate, My Bodkin, no offence! Let us, henceforth, but nurse our pounds, Thou dost protect our pence! Well art thou pointed 'gainst the Poor, For, when the Beggar Crew Bring their petitions, thou art paid, Of course, to “run them through.” Of course thou art, what Hamlet meant— To wretches the last friend; What ills can mortals have, they can't With a bare Bodkin end? PLAYING AT SOLDIERS. “WHO'LL SERVE THE KING?” AN ILLUSTRATION. What little urchin is there never Hath had that early scarlet fever, Of martial trappings caught? Trappings well call'd—because they trap And catch full many a country chap To go where fields are fought! What little urchin with a rag Hath never made a little flag, (Our plate will show the manner,) And wooed each tiny neighbour still, Tommy or Harry, Dick or Will, To come beneath the banner! Just like that ancient shape of mist In Hamlet, crying, “'List, O 'list!” Come, who will serve the king, And strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead And cut off Boneyparty's head?— And all that sort of thing. So used I, when I was a boy, To march with military toy, And ape the soldier-life;— And with a whistle or a hum, I thought myself a Duke of Drum At least, or Earl of Fife. With gun of tin and sword of lath, Lord! how I walk'd in glory's path With regimental mates, By sound of trump and rub-a-dubs, To 'siege the washhouse—charge the tubs— Or storm the garden-gates! Ah me! my retrospective soul! As over memory's muster-roll I cast my eyes anew, My former comrades all the while Rise up before me, rank and file, And form in dim review. Ay, there they stand, and dress in line, Lubbock, and Fenn, and David Vine, And dark “Jamakey Forde!” And limping Wood, and “Cocky Hawes,” Our captain always made, because He had a real sword! Long Lawrence, Natty Smart, and Soame, Who said he had a gun at home, But that was all a brag; Ned Ryder, too, that used to sham A prancing horse, and big Sam Lamb That would hold up the flag! Tom Anderson, and “Dunny White,” Who never right-abouted right, For he was deaf and dumb; Jack Pike, Jem Crack, and Sandy Gray, And Dicky Bird, that wouldn't play Unless he had the drum. And Peter Holt, and Charley Jepp, A chap that never kept the step— No more did “Surly Hugh;” Bob Harrington, and “Fighting Jim”— We often had to halt for him, To let him tie his shoe. “Quarrelsome Scott,” and Martin Dick, That kill'd the bantam cock, to stick The plumes within his hat; Bill Hook, and little Tommy Grout That got so thump'd for calling out “Eyes right!” to “Squinting Matt.” Dan Simpson, that, with Peter Dodd, Was always in the awkward squad, And those two greedy Blakes, That took our money to the fair To buy the corps a trumpet there, And laid it out in cakes. Where are they now?—an open war With open mouth declaring for?— Or fall'n in bloody fray? Compell'd to tell the truth I am, Their fights all ended with the sham,— Their soldiership in play. Brave Soame sends cheeses out in trucks, And Martin sells the cock he plucks, And Jepp now deals in wine; Harrington bears a lawyer's bag, And warlike Lamb retains his flag, But on a tavern sign. They tell me Cocky Hawes's sword Is seen upon a broker's board; And as for “Fighting Jim,” In Bishopsgate, last Whitsuntide, His unresisting cheek I spied Beneath a quaker brim! Quarrelsome Scott is in the church, For Ryder now your eye must search The marts of silk and lace— Bird's drums are fill'd with figs, and mute, And I—I've got a substitute To soldier in my place! THE DEATH BED. We watch'd her breathing through the night, Her breathing soft and low, As in her breast the wave of life Kept heaving to and fro. So silently we seem'd to speak, So slowly moved about, As we had lent her half our powers To eke her living out. Our very hopes belied our fears, Our fears our hopes belied— We thought her dying when she slept, And sleeping when she died. For when the morn came dim and sad, And chill with early showers, Her quiet eyelids closed—she had Another morn than ours. TO MY WIFE. Still glides the gentle streamlet on, With shifting current new and strange The water, that was here, is gone, But those green shadows never change. Serene or ruffled by the storm, On present waves, as on the past, The mirror'd grove retains its form, The self-same trees their semblance cast. The hue each fleeting globule wears, That drop bequeaths it to the next; One picture still the surface bears, To illustrate the murmur'd text. So, love, however time may flow, Fresh hours pursuing those that flee, One constant image still shall show My tide of life is true to thee. SONG. [There is dew for the flow'ret] The first two verses of this poem were written by my father, the two last were added by Barry Cornwall, at my mother's request, with a view to its being published with music. [Ed.] There is dew for the flow'ret And honey for the bee, And bowers for the wild bird, And love for you and me. There are tears for the many And pleasures for the few; But let the world pass on, dear, There's love for me and you. There is care that will not leave us, And pain that will not flee; But on our hearth unalter'd Sits Love—'tween you and me. Our love it ne'er was reckon'd, Yet good it is and true, It's half the world to me, dear, It's all the world to you. VERSES IN AN ALBUM. Far above the hollow Tempest, and its moan. Singeth bright Apollo In his golden zone,— Cloud doth never shade him. Nor a storm invade him, On his joyous throne. So when I behold me In an orb as bright, How thy soul doth fold me In its throne of light! Sorrow never paineth, Nor a care attaineth, To that blessed height. 1826. A RECIPE—FOR CIVILISATION. Surely, those sages err who teach That man is known from brutes by speech, Which hardly severs man from woman, But not th' inhuman from the human— Or else might parrots claim affinity, And dogs be doctors by Latinity,— Not t'insist, (as might be shown,) That beasts have gibberish of their own, Which once was no dead tongue, tho' we Since Esop's days have lost the key; Nor yet to hint dumb men,—and, still, not Beasts that could gossip though they will not, But play at dummy like the monkeys, For fear mankind should make them flunkies. Neither can man be known by feature Or form, because so like a creature, That some grave men could never shape Which is the aped and which the ape, Nor by his gait, nor by his height, Nor yet because he's black or white, But rational,—for so we call The only Cooking Animal! The only one who brings his bit Of dinner to the pot or spit, For where's the lion e'er was hasty, To put his ven'son in a pasty Ergo, by logic, we repute, That he who cooks is not a brute,— But Equus brutum est, which means, If a horse had sense he'd boil his beans, Nay, no one but a horse would forage On naked oats instead of porridge, Which proves, if brutes and Scotchmen vary, The difference is culinary. Further, as man is known by feeding From brutes,—so men from men, in breeding Are still distinguish'd as they eat, And raw in manners, raw in meat,— Look at the polish'd nations, hight The civilised—the most polite Is that which bears the praise of nations For dressing eggs two hundred fashions, Whereas, at savage feeders look,— The less refined the less they cook; From Tartar grooms that merely straddle Across a steak and warm their saddle, Down to the Abyssinian squaw, That bolts her chops and collops raw, And, like a wild beast, cares as little To dress her person as her victual,— For gowns, and gloves, and caps, and tippets, Are beauty's sauces, spice, and sippets, And not by shamble bodies put on, But those who roast and boil their mutton; So Eve and Adam wore no dresses Because they lived on water-cresses, And till they learn'd to cook their crudities, Went blind as beetles to their nudities. For niceness comes from th' inner side, (As an ox is drest before his hide,) And when the entrail loathes vulgarity The outward man will soon cull rarity, For 'tis th' effect of what we eat To make a man look like his meat, As insects show their food's complexions; Thus fopling clothes are like confections. But who, to feed a jaunty coxcomb, Would have an Abyssinian ox come? Or serve a dish of fricassees, To clodpoles in a coat of frieze? Whereas a black would call for buffalo Alive—and, no doubt, eat the offal too. Now, (this premised) it follows then That certain culinary men Should first go forth with pans and spits To bring the heathens to their wits, (For all wise Scotchmen of our century Know that first steps are alimentary; And, as we have proved, flesh pots and saucepans Must pave the way for Wilberforce plans); But Bunyan err'd to think the near gate To take man's soul, was battering Ear gate, When reason should have work'd her course As men of war do—when their force Can't take a town by open courage, They steal an entry with its forage. What reverend bishop, for example, Could preach horn'd Apis from his temple? Whereas a cook would soon unseat him, And make his own churchwardens eat him. Not Irving could convert those vermin Th' Anthropophages, by a sermon; Whereas your Osborne, in a trice, Would “take a shin of beef and spice,”— And raise them such a savoury smother, No negro would devour his brother, But turn his stomach round as loth As Persians, to the old ‘black’ broth,— For knowledge oftenest makes an entry, As well as true love, thro' the pantry, Where beaux that came at first for feeding Grow gallant men and get good breeding;— Exempli gratiâ—in the West, Ship-traders say there swims a nest Lined with black natives, like a rookery, But coarse as carrion crows at cookery.— This race, though now call'd O. Y. E. men, (To show they are more than A. B. C. men,) Was once so ignorant of our knacks They laid their mats upon their backs, And grew their quartern loaves for luncheon On trees that baked them in the sunshine. As for their bodies, they were coated, (For painted things are so denoted;) But—the naked truth is—stark primevals, That said their prayers to timber devils, Allow'd polygamy—dwelt in wigwams— And, when they meant a feast, ate big yams.— And why?—because their savage nook Had ne'er been visited by Cook,— And so they fared till our great chief, Brought them, not Methodists, but beef In tubs,—and taught them how to live, Knowing it was too soon to give, Just then, a homily on their sins, (For cooking ends ere grace begins,) Or hand his tracts to the untractable Till they could keep a more exact table— For nature has her proper courses, And wild men must be back'd like horses, Which, jockeys know, are never fit For riding till they've had a bit I' the mouth; but then, with proper tackle, You may trot them to a tabernacle, Ergo (I say) he first made changes In the heathen modes, by kitchen ranges, And taught the king's cook, by convincing Process, that chewing was not mincing, And in her black fist thrust a bundle Of tracts abridged from Glasse and Rundell, Where, ere she had read beyond Welsh rabbits, She saw the spareness of her habits, And round her loins put on a striped Towel, where fingers might be wiped, And then her breast clothed like her ribs, (For aprons lead of course to bibs,) And, by the time she had got a meat- Screen, veil'd her back, too, from the heat— As for her gravies and her sauces, (Tho' they reform'd the royal fauces,) Her forcemeats and ragouts,—I praise not, Because the legend further says not, Except, she kept each Christian high-day, And once upon a fat good Fry-day Ran short of logs, and told the Pagan, That turn'd the spit, to chop up Dagon!— LOVE. O Love! what art thou, Love? the ace of hearts, Trumping earth's kings and queens, and all its suits; A player, masquerading many parts In life's odd carnival;—a boy that shoots, From ladies' eyes, such mortal woundy darts; A gardener, pulling heart's-ease up by the roots: The Puck of Passion—partly false—part real— A marriageable maiden's “beau ideal.” O Love! what art thou, Love? a wicked thing, Making green misses spoil their work at school? A melancholy man, cross-gartering? Grave ripe-faced wisdom made an April fool? A youngster tilting at a wedding-ring? A sinner, sitting on a cuttie stool? A Ferdinand de Something in a hovel, Helping Matilda Rose to make a novel? O Love! what art thou, Love? one that is bad With palpitations of the heart—like mine— A poor bewilder'd maid, making so sad A necklace of her garters—fell design! A poet, gone unreasonably mad, Ending his sonnets with a hempen line? O Love!—but whither, now? forgive me, pray; I'm not the first that Love hath led astray. “THE LAST MAN.’ 'Twas in the year two thousand and one, A pleasant morning of May, I sat on the gallows-tree all alone, A-chanting a merry lay,— To think how the pest had spared my life, To sing with the larks that day!— When up the heath came a jolly knave, Like a scarecrow, all in rags: It made me crow to see his old duds All abroad in the wind, like flags:— So up he came to the timbers' foot And pitch'd down his greasy bags.— Good Lord! how blythe the old beggar was! At pulling out his scraps,— The very sight of his broken orts Made a work in his wrinkled chaps: “Come down,” says he, “you Newgate-bird, And have a taste of my snaps!”— Then down the rope, like a tar from the mast, I slided, and by him stood; But I wish'd myself on the gallows again When I smelt that beggar's food,— A foul beef-bone and a mouldy crust;— “Oh!” quoth he, “the heavens are good!” Then after this grace he cast him down: Says I, “You'll get sweeter air A pace or two off, on the windward side,”— For the felons' bones lay there— But he only laugh'd at the empty skulls, And offer'd them part of his fare. “I never harm'd them, and they won't harm me; Let the proud and the rich be cravens!” I did not like that strange beggar man, He look'd so up at the heavens. Anon he shook out his empty old poke; “There's the crumbs,” saith he, “for the ravens! It made me angry to see his face, It had such a jesting look; But while I made up my mind to speak, A small case-bottle he took: Quoth he, “Though I gather the green water-cress, My drink is not of the brook!” Full manners-like he tender'd the dram; Oh, it came of a dainty cask! But, whenever it came to his turn to pull, “Your leave, good Sir, I must ask; But I always wipe the brim with my sleeve, When a hangman sups at my flask!” And then he laugh'd so loudly and long, The churl was quite out of breath; I thought the very Old One was come To mock me before my death, And wish'd I had buried the dead men's bones That were lying about the heath! But the beggar gave me a jolly clap— “Come, let us pledge each other, For all the wide world is dead beside, And we are brother and brother— I've a yearning for thee in my heart, As if we had come of one mother. “I've a yearning for thee in my heart That almost makes me weep, For as I pass'd from town to town The folks were all stone-asleep,— But when I saw thee sitting aloft, It made me both laugh and leap!” Now a curse (I thought) be on his love, And a curse upon his mirth,— An it were not for that beggar man I'd be the King of the earth,— But I promised myself, an hour should come To make him rue his birth!— So down we sat and boused again Till the sun was in mid-sky, When, just as the gentle west-wind came, We hearken'd a dismal cry; “Up, up, on the tree,” quoth the beggar man, “Till these horrible dogs go by!” And, lo! from the forest's far-off skirts, They came all yelling for gore, A hundred hounds pursuing at once, And a panting hart before, Till he sunk adown at the gallows' foot And there his haunches they tore! His haunches they tore, without a horn To tell when the chase was done; And there was not a single scarlet coat To flaunt it in the sun!— I turn'd, and look'd at the beggar man, And his tears dropt one by one! And with curses sore he chid at the hounds, Till the last dropt out of sight, Anon, saith he, “let's down again, And ramble for our delight, For the world's all free, and we may choose A right cozie barn for to-night!” With that, he set up his staff on end, And it fell with the point due West; So we fared that way to a city great, Where the folks had died of the pest— It was fine to enter in house and hall, Wherever it liked me best;— For the porters all were stiff and cold, And could not lift their heads; And when we came where their masters lay, The rats leapt out of the beds:— The grandest palaces in the land Were as free as workhouse sheds. But the beggar man made a mumping face, And knock'd at every gate: It made me curse to hear how he whined, So our fellowship turn'd to hate, And I bade him walk the world by himself, For I scorn'd so humble a mate! So he turn'd right and I turn'd left, As if we had never met; And I chose a fair stone house for myself, For the city was all to let; And for three brave holidays drank my fill Of the choicest that I could get. And because my jerkin was coarse and worn, I got me a properer vest; It was purple velvet, stitch'd o'er with gold, And a shining star at the breast,— 'Twas enough to fetch old Joan from her grave To see me so purely drest!— But Joan was dead and under the mould, And every buxom lass; In vain I watch'd, at the window pane, For a Christian soul to pass;— But sheep and kine wander'd up the street, And browsed on the new-come grass.— When lo! I spied the old beggar man, And lustily he did sing!— His rags were lapp'd in a scarlet cloak, And a crown he had like a King; So he stept right up before my gate And danced me a saucy fling! Heaven mend us all!—but, within my mind, I had kill'd him then and there; To see him lording so braggart-like That was born to his beggar's fare, And how he had stolen the royal crown His betters were meant to wear. But God forbid that a thief should die Without his share of the laws! So I nimbly whipt my tackle out, And soon tied up his claws,— I was judge myself, and jury, and all, And solemnly tried the cause. But the beggar man would not plead, but cried Like a babe without its corals, For he knew how hard it is apt to go When the law and a thief have quarrels,— There was not a Christian soul alive To speak a word for his morals. Oh, how gaily I doff'd my costly gear, And put on my work-day clothes; I was tired of such a long Sunday life,— And never was one of the sloths; But the beggar man grumbled a weary deal, And made many crooked mouths. So I haul'd him off to the gallows' foot, And blinded him in his bags; 'Twas a weary job to heave him up, For a doom'd man always lags; But by ten of the clock he was off his legs In the wind and airing his rags! So there he hung and there I stood, The LAST MAN left alive, To have my own will of all the earth: Quoth I, now I shall thrive! But when was ever honey made With one bee in a hive! My conscience began to gnaw my heart, Before the day was done, For the other men's lives had all gone out, Like candles in the sun!— But it seem'd as if I had broke, at last, A thousand necks in one! So I went and cut his body down, To bury it decentlie;— God send there were any good soul alive To do the like by me! But the wild dogs came with terrible speed, And bay'd me up the tree! My sight was like a drunkard's sight, And my head began to swim, To see their jaws all white with foam, Like the ravenous ocean-brim;— But when the wild dogs trotted away Their jaws were bloody and grim! Their jaws were bloody and grim, good Lord! But the beggar man, where was he?— There was nought of him but some ribbons of rags Below the gallows' tree!— I know the Devil, when I am dead, Will send his hounds for me!— I've buried my babies one by one, And dug the deep hole for Joan, And cover'd the faces of kith and kin, And felt the old churchyard stone Go cold to my heart, full many a time, But I never felt so lone! For the lion and Adam were company, And the tiger him beguiled; But the simple kine are foes to my life, And the household brutes are wild. If the veriest cur would lick my hand, I could love it like a child! And the beggar man's ghost besets my dream, At night, to make me madder,— And my wretched conscience, within my breast, Is like a stinging adder;— I sigh when I pass the gallows' foot, And look at the rope and ladder! For hanging looks sweet,—but, alas! in vain, My desperate fancy begs,— I must turn my cup of sorrows quite up, And drink it to the dregs,— For there is not another man alive, In the world, to pull my legs! FAITHLESS SALLY BROWN. AN OLD BALLAD Young Ben he was a nice young man, A carpenter by trade; And he fell in love with Sally Brown, That was a lady's maid. But as they fetch'd a walk one day, They met a press-gang crew; And Sally she did faint away, Whilst Ben he was brought to. The Boatswain swore with wicked words, Enough to shock a saint, That though she did seem in a fit, 'Twas nothing but a feint. “Come, girl,” said he, “hold up your head, He'll be as good as me; For when your swain is in our boat, A boatswain he will be.” So when they'd made their game of her, And taken off her elf, She roused, and found she only was A-coming to herself. “And is he gone, and is he gone?” She cried, and wept outright: “Then I will to the water side, And see him out of sight.” A waterman came up to her, “Now, young woman,” said he, “If you weep on so, you will make Eye-water in the sea.” “Alas! they've taken my beau Ben To sail with old Benbow;” And her woe began to run afresh, As if she'd said Gee woe! Says he, “They've only taken him To the Tender ship, you see;” “The Tender ship,” cried Sally Brown, “What a hard-ship that must be! “O! would I were a mermaid now For then I'd follow him; But Oh!—I'm not a fish-woman, And so I cannot swim. “Alas! I was not born beneath The Virgin and the Scales, So I must curse my cruel stars, And walk about in Wales.” Now Ben had sail'd to many a place That's underneath the world; But in two years the ship came home, And all her sails were furl'd. But when he call'd on Sally Brown, To see how she got on, He found she'd got another Ben, Whose Christian name was John. “O Sally Brown, O Sally Brown, How could you serve me so? I've met with many a breeze before, But never such a blow.” Then reading on his 'bacco-box, He heaved a bitter sigh, And then began to eye his pipe, And then to pipe his eye. And then he tried to sing “All's Well,” But could not though he tried; His head was turn'd, and so he chew'd His pigtail till he died. His death, which happen'd in his berth, At forty-odd befell: They went and told the sexton, and The sexton toll'd the bell. A FAIRY TALE. On Hounslow heath—and close beside the road, As western travellers may oft have seen,— A little house some years ago there stood, A minikin abode; And built like Mr. Birkbeck's, all of wood; The walls of white, the window-shutters green;— Four wheels it had at North, South, East, and West, (Tho' now at rest) On which it used to wander to and fro, Because its master ne'er maintain'd a rider, Like those who trade in Paternoster Row; But made his business travel for itself, Till he had made his pelf, And then retired—if one may call it so, Of a roadsider. Perchance, the very race and constant riot Of stages, long and short, which thereby ran, Made him more relish the repose and quiet Of his now sedentary caravan; Perchance, he loved the ground because 'twas common, And so he might impale a strip of soil, That furnish'd, by his toil, Some dusty greens, for him and his old woman;— And five tall hollyhocks, in dingy flower. Howbeit, the thoroughfare did no ways spoil His peace,—unless, in some unlucky hour, A stray horse came and gobbled up his bow'r! But, tired of always looking at the coaches, The same to come,—when they had seen them one day! And, used to brisker life, both man and wife Began to suffer N–U–E's approaches, And feel retirement like a long wet Sunday,— So, having had some quarters of school-breeding, They turn'd themselves, like other folks, to reading; But setting out where others nigh have done, And being ripen'd in the seventh stage, The childhood of old age, Began, as other children have begun,— Not with the pastorals of Mr. Pope, Or Bard of Hope, Or Paley ethical, or learned Porson,— But spelt, on Sabbaths, in St. Mark, or John, And then relax'd themselves with Whittington, Or Valentine and Orson— But chiefly fairy tales they loved to con, And being easily melted, in their dotage, Slobber'd,—and kept Reading,—and wept Over the White Cat, in their wooden cottage. Thus reading on—the longer They read, of course, their childish faith grew stronger In Gnomes, and Hags, and Elves, and Giants grim,— If talking Trees and Birds reveal'd to him, She saw the flight of Fairyland's fly-waggons, And magic-fishes swim In puddle ponds, and took old crows for dragons,— Both were quite drunk from the enchanted flagons; When, as it fell upon a summer's day, As the old man sat a feeding On the old babe-reading, Beside his open street-and-parlour door, A hideous roar Proclaim'd a drove of beasts was coming by the way. Long-horn'd, and short, of many a different breed, Tall, tawny brutes, from famous Lincoln-levels, Or Durham feed, With some of those unquiet black dwarf devils From nether side of Tweed, Or Firth of Forth; Looking half wild with joy to leave the North,— With dusty hides, all mobbing on together,— When,—whether from a fly's malicious comment Upon his tender flank, from which he shrank; Or whether Only in some enthusiastic moment,— However, one brown monster, in a frisk, Giving his tail a perpendicular whisk, Kick'd out a passage thro' the beastly rabble: And after a pas seul,—or, if you will, a Horn-pipe before the Basket-maker's villa, Leapt o'er the tiny pale,— Back'd his beef-steaks against the wooden gable, And thrust his brawny bell-rope of a tail Right o'er the page, Wherein the sage Just then was spelling some romantic fable. The old man, half a scholar, half a dunce, Could not peruse,—who could?—two tales at once, And being huff'd At what he knew was none of Riquet's Tuft, Bang'd-to the door, But most unluckily enclosed a morsel Of the intruding tail, and all the tassel:— The monster gave a roar, And bolting off with speed, increased by pain, The little house became a coach once more, And, like Macheath, “took to the road” again! Just then, by fortune's whimsical decree, The ancient woman stooping with her crupper Towards sweet home, or where sweet home should be, Was getting up some household herbs for supper: Thoughtful of Cinderella, in the tale, And quaintly wondering if magic shifts Could o'er a common pumpkin so prevail, To turn it to a coach,—what pretty gifts Might come of cabbages, and curly kale; Meanwhile she never heard her old man's wail, Nor turn'd, till home had turn'd a corner, quite Gone out of sight! At last, conceive her, rising from the ground, Weary of sitting on her russet clothing; And looking round Where rest was to be found, There was no house—no villa there—no nothing! No house! The change was quite amazing; It made her senses stagger for a minute, The riddle's explication seem'd to harden; But soon her superannuated nous Explain'd the horrid mystery;—and raising Her hand to heaven, with the cabbage in it, On which she meant to sup,— “Well! this is Fairy Work! I'll bet a farden, Little Prince Silverwings has ketch'd me up, And set me down in some one else's garden!” THE IRISH SCHOOLMASTER. Alack! 'tis melancholy theme to think How Learning doth in rugged states abide, And, like her bashful owl, obscurely blink, In pensive glooms and corners, scarceley spied; Not, as in Founders' Halls and domes of pride, Served with grave homage, like a tragic queen, But with one lonely priest compell'd to hide, In midst of foggy moors and mosses green, In that clay cabin hight the College of Kilreen! This College looketh South and West alsoe, Because it hath a cast in windows twain; Crazy and crack'd they be, and wind doth blow Thorough transparent holes in every pane, Which Dan, with many paines, makes whole again With nether garments, which his thrift doth teach, To stand for glass, like pronouns, and when rain Stormeth, he puts, “once more unto the breach,”— Outside and in, tho' broke, yet so he mendeth each. And in the midst a little door there is, Whereon a board that doth congratulate With painted letters, red as blood I wis, Thus written, “Children taken in to Bate:” And oft, indeed, the inward of that gate, Most ventriloque, doth utter tender squeak, And moans of infants that bemoan their fate, In midst of sounds of Latin, French, and Greek, Which, all i' the Irish tongue, he teacheth them to speak. For some are meant to right illegal wrongs, And some for Doctors of Divinitie, Whom he doth teach to murder the dead tongues, And soe win academical degree; But some are bred for service of the sea, Howbeit, their store of learning is but small, For mickle waste he counteth it would be To stock a head with bookish wares at all, Only to be knocked off by ruthless cannon ball. Six babes he sways,—some little and some big, Divided into classes six;—alsoe, He keeps a parlour boarder of a pig, That in the College fareth to and fro, And picketh up the urchins' crumbs below,— And eke the learned rudiments they scan, And thus his A, B, C, doth wisely know— Hereafter to be shown in caravan, And raise the wonderment of many a learned man. Alsoe, he schools some tame familiar fowls, Whereof, above his head, some two or three Sit darkly squatting, like Minerva's owls. But on the branches of no living tree, And overlook the learned family; While, sometimes, Partlet, from her gloomy perch, Drops feather on the nose of Dominie, Meanwhile, with serious eye, he makes research In leaves of that sour tree of knowledge—now a birch. No chair he hath, the awful Pedagogue, Such as would magisterial hams imbed, But sitteth lowly on a beechen log, Secure in high authority and dread: Large, as a dome for learning, seems his head, And like Apollo's, all beset with rays, Because his locks are so unkempt and red, And stand abroad in many several ways: No laurel crown he wears, howbeit his cap is baize, And, underneath, a pair of shaggy brows O'erhang as many eyes of gizzard hue, That inward giblet of a fowl, which shows A mongrel tint, that is ne brown ne blue; His nose,—it is a coral to the view; Well nourish'd with Pierian Potheen,— For much he loves his native mountain dew;— But to depict the dye would lack, I ween, A bottle-red, in terms, as well as bottle-green. As for his coat, 'tis such a jerkin short As Spencer had, ere he composed his Tales: But underneath he hath no vest, nor aught, So that the wind his airy breast assails; Below, he wears the nether garb of males, Of crimson plush, but non-plushed at the knee; Thence further down the native red prevails, Of his own naked fleecy hosierie:— Two sandals, without soles, complete his cap-a-pie. Nathless, for dignity, he now doth lap His function in a magisterial gown, That shows more countries in it than a map,— Blue tinct, and red, and green, and russet-brown, Besides some blots, standing for country-town; And eke some rents, for streams and rivers wide; But, sometimes, bashful when he looks adown, He turns the garment of the other side, Hopeful that so the holes may never be espied? And soe he sits, amidst the little pack, That look for shady or for sunny noon, Within his visage, like an almanack— His quiet smile foretelling gracious boon; But when his mouth droops down, like rainy moon, With horrid chill each little heart unwarms, Knowing, that infant show'rs will follow soon, And with forebodings of near wrath and storms They sit, like timid hares, all trembling on their forms. Ah! luckless wight, who cannot then repeat “Corduroy Colloquy,”—or “Ki, Kæ, Kod,”— Full soon his tears shall make his turfy seat More sodden, tho' already made of sod, For Dan shall whip him with the word of God,— Severe by rule, and not by nature mild, He never spoils the child and spares the rod, But spoils the rod and never spares the child, And soe with holy rule deems he is reconciled. But surely the just sky will never wink At men who take delight in childish throe, And stripe the nether-urchin like a pink Or tender hyacinth, inscribed with woe; Such bloody Pedagogues, when they shall know, By useless birches, that forlorn recess, Which is no holiday, in Pit below, Will hell not seem design'd for their distress— A melancholy place, that is all bottomlesse? Yet would the Muse not chide the wholesome use Of needful discipline, in due degree. Devoid of sway, what wrongs will time produce, Whene'er the twig untrain'd grows up a tree, This shall a Carder, that a Whiteboy be, Ferocious leaders of atrocious bands, And Learning's help be used for infamie, By lawless clerks, that, with their bloody hands, In murder'd English write Rock's murderous commands. But ah! what shrilly cry doth now alarm The sooty fowls that dozed upon the beam, All sudden fluttering from the brandish'd arm, And cackling chorus with the human scream; Meanwhile, the scourge plies that unkindly seam In Phelim's brogues, which bares his naked skin, Like traitor gap in warlike fort, I deem, That falsely lets the fierce besieger in, Nor seeks the Pedagogue by other course to win. No parent dear he hath to heed his cries;— Alas! his parent dear is far aloof, And deep in Seven-Dial cellar lies, Killed by kind cudgel-play, or gin of proof, Or climbeth, catwise, on some London roof, Singing, perchance, a lay of Erin's Isle, Or, whilst he labours, weaves a fancy-woof, Dreaming he sees his home—his Phelim's smile; Ah me? that luckless imp, who weepeth all the while! Ah! who can paint that hard and heavy time, When first the scholar 'lists in learning's train, And mounts her rugged steep, enforced to climb, Like sooty imp, by sharp posterior pain, From bloody twig, and eke that Indian cane, Wherein, alas! no sugar'd juices dwell? For this, the while one stripling's sluices drain, Another weepeth over chilblains fell, Always upon the heel, yet never to be well! Anon a third,—for his delicious root, Late ravish'd from his tooth by elder chit, So soon is human violence afoot, So hardly is the harmless biter bit! Meanwhile, the tyrant, with untimely wit And mouthing face, derides the small one's moan, Who, all lamenting for his loss, doth sit, Alack,—mischance comes seldomtimes alone, But aye the worried dog must rue more curs than one. For lo! the Pedagogue, with sudden drub, Smites his scald head, that is already sore,— (Superfluous wound,—such is Misfortune's rub) Who straight makes answer with redoubled roar, And sheds salt tears twice faster than before, That still with backward fist he strives to dry; Washing with brackish moisture, o'er and o'er, His muddy cheek, that grows more foul thereby, Till all his rainy face looks grim as rainy sky. So Dan, by dint of noise, obtains a peace, And with his natural untender knack, By new distress, bids former grievance cease, Like tears dried up with rugged huckaback, That sets the mournful visage all awrack; Yet soon the childish countenance will shine Even as thorough storms the soonest slack, For grief and beef in adverse ways incline, This keeps, and that decays, when duly soak'd in brine. Now all is hush'd, and, with a look profound, The Dominie lays ope the learned page; (So be it called, although he doth expound Without a book) both Greek and Latin sage; Now telleth he of Rome's rude infant age, How Romulus was bred in savage wood, By wet-nurse wolf, devoid of wolfish rage; And laid foundation-stone of walls of mud, But watered it, alas! with warm fraternal blood. Anon he turns to that Homeric war, How Troy was sieged like Londonderry town; And stout Achilles, at his jaunting-car, Dragged mighty Hector with a bloody crown: And eke the bard, that sung of their renown, In garb of Greece most beggar-like and torn, He paints, with colly, wand'ring up and down: Because, at once, in seven cities born; And so, of parish rights, was, all his days, forlorn. Anon, through old Mythology he goes, Of gods defunct, and all their pedigrees, But shuns their scandalous amours, and shows How Plato wise, and clear-eyed Socrates, Confess'd not to those heathen hes and shes; But thro' the clouds of the Olympic cope Beheld St. Peter, with his holy keys, And own'd their love was naught, and bow'd to Pope, Whilst all their purblind race in Pagan mist did grope. From such quaint themes he turns, at last, aside, To new philosophies, that still are green, And shows what rail-roads have been track'd to guide The wheels of great political machine; If English corn should grow abroad, I ween, And gold be made of gold, or paper sheet; How many pigs be born to each spalpeen; And ah! how man shall thrive beyond his meat,— With twenty souls alive, to one square sod of peat! Here, he makes end; and all the fry of youth, That stood around with serious look intense, Close up again their gaping eyes and mouth, Which they had open'd to his eloquence, As if their hearing were a threefold sense. But now the current of his words is done, And whether any fruits shall spring from thence, In future time, with any mother's son!— It is a thing, God wot! that can be told by none. Now by the creeping shadows of the noon, The hour is come to lay aside their lore; The cheerful Pedagogue perceives it soon, And cries, “Begone!” unto the imps,—and four Snatch their two hats and struggle for the door,— Like ardent spirits vented from a cask, All blithe and boisterous,—but leave two more, With Reading made Uneasy for a task, To weep, whilst all their mates in merry sunshine bask. Like sportive Elfins, on the verdant sod, With tender moss so sleekly overgrown, That doth not hurt, but kiss, the sole unshod, So soothly kind is Erin to her own! And one, at Hare-and-Hound, plays all alone,— For Phelim's gone to tend his step-dame's cow; Ah! Phelim's step-dame is a canker'd crone! Whilst other twain play at an Irish row, And, with shillelah small, break one another's brow! But careful Dominie, with ceaseless thrift, Now changeth ferula for rural hoe; But, first of all, with tender hand doth shift His college gown, because of solar glow, And hangs it on a bush, to scare the crow: Meanwhile, he plants in earth the dappled bean, Or trains the young potatoes all a-row, Or plucks the fragrant leek for pottage green, With that crisp curly herb, call'd Kale in Aberdeen. And so he wisely spends the fruitful hours, Link'd each to each by labour, like a bee; Or rules in Learning's hall, or trims her bow'rs;— Would there were many more such wights as he, To sway each capital academie Of Cam and Isis; for, alack! at each There dwells, I wot, some dronish Dominie, That does no garden work, nor yet doth teach, But wears a floury head, and talks in flow'ry speech! FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY. A PATHETIC BALLAD. Ben Battle was a soldier bold, And used to war's alarms: But a cannon-ball took off his legs, So he laid down his arms! Now as they bore him off the field, Said he, “Let others shoot, For here I leave my second leg, And the Forty-second Foot!” The army-surgeons made him limbs: Said he,—“They're only pegs: But there's as wooden Members quite. As represent my legs!” Now Ben he loved a pretty maid, Her name was Nelly Gray; So he went to pay her his devours, When he'd devoured his pay! But when he called on Nelly Gray, She made him quite a scoff; And when she saw his wooden legs, Began to take them off! “Oh, Nelly Gray! Oh, Nelly Gray! Is this your love so warm? The love that loves a scarlet coat Should be more uniform!” Said she, “I loved a soldier once, For he was blythe and brave; But I will never have a man With both legs in the grave! “Before you had those timber toes, Your love I did allow, But then, you know, you stand upon Another footing now!” “Oh, Nelly Gray! Oh, Nelly Gray! For all your jeering speeches, At duty's call, I left my legs, In Badajos's breaches!” “Why then,” said she, “you've lost the feet Of legs in war's alarms, And now you cannot wear your shoes Upon your feats of arms!” “Oh, false and fickle Nelly Gray! I know why you refuse:— Though I've no feet—some other man Is standing in my shoes! “I wish I ne'er had seen your face; But, now, a long farewell! For you will be my death;—alas! You will not be my Nell!” Now when he went from Nelly Gray, His heart so heavy got— And life was such a burthen grown, It made him take a knot! So round his melancholy neck, A rope he did entwine, And, for his second time in life, Enlisted in the Line! One end he tied around a beam, And then removed his pegs, And, as his legs were off,—of course, He soon was off his legs! And there he hung, till he was dead As any nail in town,— For, though distress had cut him up, It could not cut him down! A dozen men sat on his corpse, To find out why he died— And they buried Ben in four cross-roads, With a stake in his inside! THE WATER LADY. Alas, the moon should ever beam To show what man should never see!— I saw a maiden on a stream, And fair was she! I staid awhile, to see her throw Her tresses back, that all beset The fair horizon of her brow With clouds of jet. I staid a little while to view Her cheek, that wore in place of red The bloom of water, tender blue, Daintily spread. I staid to watch, a little space, Her parted lips if she would sing; The waters closed above her face With many a ring. And still I staid a little more, Alas! she never comes again! I throw my flowers from the shore, And watch in vain. I know my life will fade away, I know that I must vainly pine, For I am made of mortal clay, But she's divine! AUTUMN. The Autumn is old, The sere leaves are flying; He hath gather'd up gold, And now he is dying;— Old Age, begin sighing! The vintage is ripe, The harvest is heaping;— But some that have sow'd Have no riches for reaping;— Poor wretch, fall a-weeping! The year's in the wane, There is nothing adorning, The night has no eve, And the day has no morning;— Cold winter gives warning. The rivers run chill, The red sun is sinking, And I am grown old, And life is fast shrinking;— Here's enow for sad thinking! I REMEMBER, I REMEMBER. I remember, I remember, The house where I was born, The little window where the sun Came peeping in at morn; He never came a wink too soon, Nor brought too long a day, But now, I often wish the night Had borne my breath away! I remember, I remember, The roses, red and white, The violets, and the lily-cups, Those flowers made of light! The lilacs where the robin built, And where my brother set The laburnum on his birth-day,— The tree is living yet! I remember, I remember Where I was used to swing, And thought the air must rush as fresh To swallows on the wing; My spirit flew in feathers then, That is so heavy now, And summer pools could hardly cool The fever on my brow! I remember, I remember The fir trees dark and high; I used to think their slender tops Were close against the sky: It was a childish ignorance, But now 'tis little joy To know I'm farther off from Heav'n Than when I was a boy. DEATH'S RAMBLE. One day the dreary old King of Death Inclined for some sport with the carnal, So he tied a pack of darts on his back, And quietly stole from his charnel. His head was bald of flesh and of hair, His body was lean and lank, His joints at each stir made a crack, and the cur Took a gnaw, by the way, at his shank. And what did he do with his deadly darts, This goblin of grisly bone? He dabbled and spill'd man's blood, and he kill'd Like a butcher that kills his own. The first he slaughter'd it made him laugh (For the man was a coffin-maker) To think how the mutes, and men in black suits, Would mourn for an undertaker. Death saw two Quakers sitting at church: Quoth he, “We shall not differ.” And he let them alone, like figures of stone, For he could not make them stiffer. He saw two duellists going to fight, In fear they could not smother; And he shot one through at once—for he knew They never would shoot each other. He saw a watchman fast in his box, And he gave a snore infernal; Said Death, “He may keep his breath, for his sleep Can never be more eternal.” He met a coachman driving his coach So slow, that his fare grew sick; But he let him stray on his tedious way, For Death only wars on the quick. Death saw a toll-man taking a toll, In the spirit of his fraternity; But he knew that sort of man would extort, Though summon'd to all eternity. He found an author writing his life, But he let him write no further; For Death, who strikes whenever he likes, Is jealous of all self-murther! Death saw a patient that pull'd out his purse, And a doctor that took the sum; But he let them be—for he knew that the “fee” Was a prelude to “faw” and “fum.” He met a dustman ringing a bell, And he gave him a mortal thrust; For himself, by law, since Adam's flaw, Is contractor for all our dust. He saw a sailor mixing his grog, And he mark'd him out for slaughter; For on water he scarcely had cared for Death, And never on rum-and-water. Death saw two players playing at cards, But the game wasn't worth a dump, For he quickly laid them flat with a spade, To wait for the final trump! ADDRESS TO MR. CROSS, OF EXETER CHANGE, ON THE DEATH OF THE ELEPHANT. “'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more.” Oh, Mr. Cross, Permit a sorry stranger to draw near, And shed a tear (I've shed my shilling) for thy recent loss! I've been a visitor Of old—a sort of a Buffon inquisitor Of thy menagerie, and knew the beast, That is deceased. I was the Damon of the gentle giant, And oft have been, Like Mr. Kean, Tenderly fondled by his trunk compliant. Whenever I approached, the kindly brute Flapped his prodigious ears, and bent his knees— It makes me freeze To think of it. No chums could better suit, Exchanging grateful looks for grateful fruit,— For so our former dearness was begun,— I bribed him with an apple, and beguiled The beast of his affection like a child; And well he loved me till his life was done (Except when he was wild). It makes me blush for human friends—but none I have so truly kept or cheaply won. Here is his pen! The casket—but the jewel is away; The den is rifled of its denizen,— Ah, well a day! This fresh free air breathes nothing of his grossness, And sets me sighing even for its closeness. This light one-story, Where like a cloud I used to feast my eyes on The grandeur of his Titan-like horizon, Tells a dark tale of its departed glory;— The very beasts lament the change like me. The shaggy Bison Leaneth his head dejected on his knee; The Hyæna's laugh is hushed; the Monkeys pout; The Wild Cat frets in a complaining whine; The Panther paces restlessly about, To walk her sorrow out; The Lions in a deeper bass repine; The Kang'roo wrings its sorry short forepaws; Shrieks come from the Macaws; The old bald Vulture shakes his naked head, And pineth for the dead; The Boa writhes into a double knot; The Keeper groans, Whilst sawing bones, And looks askance at the deserted spot; Brutal and rational lament his loss, The flower of the beastly family;— Poor Mrs. Cross Sheds frequent tears into her daily tea, And weakens her Bohea. Oh, Mr. Cross, how little it gives birth To grief when human greatness goes to earth; How few lament for Czars,— But, oh, the universal heart o'erflowed At his “high mass,” Lighted by gas, When like Mark Antony the keeper showed The Elephantine scars. Reporters' eyes Were of an egg-like size; Men that had never wept for murdered Marrs, Hard-hearted editors with iron faces, Their sluices all unclosed,— And discomposed Compositors went fretting to their cases, That grief has left its traces; The poor old Beef-eater has gone much greyer, With sheer regret; And the Gazette Seems the least trouble of the beasts' Purveyor. And I too weep! a dozen of great men I could have spared without a single tear; But, then, They are renewable from year to year. Fresh gents would rise though Gent resigned the pen; I should not wholly Despair for six months of another C????, Nor, though F?????????lay on his small bier, Be melancholy. But when will such an elephant appear? Though Penley were destroyed at Drury-lane, His like might come again; Fate might supply, A second Powell if the first should die; Another Bennet if the sire were snatched; Barnes—might be matched; And Time fill up the gap Were Parsloe laid upon the green earth's lap; Even Claremont might be equalled,—I could hope (All human greatness is, alas, so puny!) For other Egertons—another Pope, But not another Chunee! Well! he is dead! And there's a gap in Nature of eleven Feet high by seven— Five living tons!—and I remain nine stone Of skin and bone! It is enough to make me shake my head And dream of the grave's brink— 'Tis worse to think How like the Beast's the sorry life I've led!— A sort of show Of my poor public self and my sagacity, To profit the rapacity Of certain folks in Paternoster Row, A slavish toil to win an upper story— And a hard glory Of wooden beams about my weary brow! Oh, Mr. C.! If ever you behold me twirl my pen To earn a public supper, that is, eat In the bare street,— Or turn about their literary den— Shoot me! THE POET'S PORTION. What is a mine—a treasury—a dower— A magic talisman of mighty power? A poet's wide possession of the earth. He has th' enjoyment of a flower's birth Before its budding—ere the first red streaks, And Winter cannot rob him of their cheeks. Look—if his dawn be not as other men's! Twenty bright flushes—ere another kens The first of sunlight is abroad—he sees Its golden 'lection of the topmost trees, And opes the splendid fissures of the morn. When do his fruits delay, when doth his corn Linger for harvesting? Before the leaf Is commonly abroad, in his pil'd sheaf The flagging poppies lose their ancient flame. No sweet there is, no pleasure I can name, But he will sip it first—before the lees. 'Tis his to taste rich honey,—ere the bees Are busy with the brooms. He may forestall June's rosy advent for his coronal; Before th' expectant buds upon the bough, Twining his thoughts to bloom upon his brow. Oh! blest to see the flower in its seed, Before its leafy presence; for indeed Leaves are but wings on which the summer flies, And each thing perishable fades and dies, Escap'd in thought; but his rich thinkings be Like overflows of immortality: So that what there is steep'd shall perish never, But live and bloom, and be a joy for ever. ODE TO THE LATE LORD MAYOR, ON THE PUBLICATION OF HIS “VISIT TO OXFORD.” “Now, Night descending, the proud scene is o'er, But lives in Settle's numbers one day more.” Pope—On the Lord Mayor's Show. O Worthy Mayor!—I mean to say Ex-Mayor! Chief Luddite of the ancient town of Lud! Incumbent of the City's easy chair!— Conservator of Thames from mud to mud! Great river-bank director! And dam-inspector! Great guardian of small sprats that swim the flood! Lord of the scarlet gown and furry cap! King of Mogg's map! Keeper of Gates that long have “gone their gait!” Warder of London stone and London Log! Thou first and greatest of the civic great, Magog or Gog!— O Honorable Ven— (Forgive this little liberty between us), Augusta's first Augustus!—Friend of men Who wield the pen! Dillon's Mæcenas! Patron of learning where she ne'er did dwell, Where literature seldom finds abettors, Where few—except the postman and his bell— Encourage the bell-lettres!— Well hast thou done, Right Honorable Sir— Seeing that years are such devouring ogresses, And thou hast made some little journeying stir,— To get a Nichols to record thy Progresses! Wordsworth once wrote a trifle of the sort; But for diversion, For truth—for nature—everything in short— I own I do prefer thy own “Excursion.” The stately story Of Oxford glory— The Thames romance—yet nothing of a fiction— Like thine own stream it flows along the page— “Strong, without rage,” In diction worthy of thy jurisdiction! To future ages thou wilt seem to be A second Parry; For thou didst carry Thy navigation to a fellow crisis. He penetrated to a Frozen Sea, And thou—to where the Thames is turned to Isis! I like thy setting out! Thy coachman and thy coachmaid boxed together! I like thy Jarvey's serious face—in doubt Of “four fine animals”—no Cobbetts either! I like the slow state pace—the pace allowed The best for dignity—and for a crowd, And very July weather, So hot that it let off the Hounslow powder! I like the She-Mayor's proffer of a seat To poor Miss Magnay, fried to a white heat; 'Tis well it didn't chance to be Miss Crowder! I like the steeples with their weathercocks on, Discerned about the hour of three, P. M.; I like thy party's entrance into Oxon, For oxen soon to enter into them! I like the ensuing banquet better far, Although an act of cruelty began it;— For why—before the dinner at the Star— Why was the poor Town-clerk sent off to plan it? I like your learned rambles not amiss, Especially at Bodley's, where ye tarried The longest—doubtless because Atkins carried Letters (of course from Ignorance) to Bliss! The other Halls were scrambled through more hastily; But I like this— I like the Aldermen who stopped to drink Of Maudlin's “classic water” very tastily, Although I think—what I am loth to think— Except to Dillon, it has proved no Castaly! I like to find thee finally afloat; I like thy being barged and Water-Bailiff'd, Who gave thee a lift To thy state-galley in his own state-boat. I like thy small sixpennyworths of largess Thrown to the urchins at the City's charges; I like the sun upon thy breezy fanners, Ten splendid scarlet silken stately banners! Thy gilded bark shines out quite transcendental! I like dear Dillon still, Who quotes from “Cooper's Hill,” And Birch, the cookly Birch, grown sentimental; I like to note his civic mind expanding And quoting Denham, in the watery dock Of Iffley lock— Plainly no Locke upon the Understanding! I like thy civic deed At Runnymede, Where ancient Britons came in arms to barter Their lives for right—Ah, did not Waithman grow Half mad to show Where his renowned forefathers came to bleed— And freeborn Magnay triumph at his Charter? I like full well thy ceremonious setting The justice-sword (no doubt it wanted whetting!) On London Stone; but I don't like the waving Thy banner over it, for I must own Flag over stone Reads like a most superfluous piece of paving! I like thy Cliefden treat; but I'm not going To run the civic story through and through, But leave thy barge to Pater Noster Row-ing, My plaudit to renew.— Well hast thou done, Right Honorable rover, To leave this lasting record of thy reign, A reign, alas! that very soon is “over And gone,” according to the Rydal strain! 'Tis piteous how a mayor Slips through his chair. I say it with a meaning reverential, But let him be rich, lordly, wise, sentential, Still he must seem a thing inconsequential— A melancholy truth one cannot smother; For why? 'tis very clear He comes in at one year, To go out by the other! This is their Lordships' universal order!— But thou shalt teach them to preserve a name— Make future Chaplains chroniclers of fame! And every Lord Mayor his own Recorder! 1827. BIANCA'S DREAM. A VENETIAN STORY. Bianca!—fair Bianca!—who could dwell With safety on her dark and hazel gaze, Nor find there lurk'd in it a witching spell, Fatal to balmy nights and blessed days? The peaceful breath that made the bosom swell, She turn'd to gas, and set it in a blaze; Each eye of hers had Love's Eupyrion in it, That he could light his link at in a minute. So that, wherever in her charms she shone, A thousand breasts were kindled into flame; Maidens who cursed her looks forgot their own, And beaux were turn'd to flambeaux where she came; All hearts indeed were conquer'd but her own, Which none could ever temper down or tame: In short, to take our haberdasher's hints, She might have written over it,—“From Flints.” She was, in truth, the wonder of her sex, At least in Venice—where with eyes of brown Tenderly languid, ladies seldom vex An amorous gentle with a needless frown; Where gondolas convey guitars by pecks, And Love at casements climbeth up and down, Whom for his tricks and custom in that kind, Some have considered a Venetian blind. Howbeit, this difference was quickly taught, Amongst more youths who had this cruel jailor, To hapless Julio—all in vain he sought With each new moon his hatter and his tailor; In vain the richest padusoy he bought, And went in bran new beaver to assail her— As if to show that Love had made him smart All over—and not merely round his heart. In vain he labour'd thro' the sylvan park Bianca haunted in—that where she came, Her learned eyes in wandering might mark The twisted cypher of her maiden name, Wholesomely going thro' a course of bark: No one was touch'd or troubled by his flame, Except the Dryads, those old maids that grow In trees,—like wooden dolls in embryo. In vain complaining elegies he writ, And taught his tuneful instrument to grieve, And sang in quavers how his heart was split, Constant beneath her lattice with each eve; She mock'd his wooing with her wicked wit, And slash'd his suit so that it match'd his sleeve, Till he grew silent at the vesper star, And quite despairing, hamstring'd his guitar. Bianca's heart was coldly frosted o'er With snows unmelting—an eternal sheet, But his was red within him, like the core Of old Vesuvius, with perpetual heat; And oft he long'd internally to pour His flames and glowing lava at her feet, But when his burnings he began to spout, She stopp'd his mouth,—and put the crater out. Meanwhile he wasted in the eyes of men, So thin, he seem'd a sort of skeleton-key Suspended at death's door—so pale—and then He turn'd as nervous as an aspen tree; The life of man is three-score years and ten, But he was perishing at twenty-three, For people truly said, as grief grew stronger, “It could not shorten his poor life—much longer.” For why, he neither slept, nor drank, nor fed, Nor relish'd any kind of mirth below; Fire in his heart, and frenzy in his head, Love had become his universal foe, Salt in his sugar—nightmare in his bed, At last, no wonder wretched Julio, A sorrow-ridden thing, in utter dearth Of Hope,—made up his mind to cut her girth! For hapless lovers always died of old, Sooner than chew reflection's bitter cud; So Thisbe stuck herself, what time 'tis told, The tender-hearted mulberries wept blood; And so poor Sappho, when her boy was cold, Drown'd her salt tear-drops in a salter flood, Their fame still breathing, tho' their death be past, For those old suitors lived beyond their last. So Julio went to drown,—when life was dull, But took his corks, and merely had a bath; And once, he pull'd a trigger at his skull, But merely broke a window in his wrath; And once, his hopeless being to annul, He tied a pack-thread to a beam of lath— A line so ample, 'twas a query whether 'Twas meant to be a halter or a tether. Smile not in scorn, that Julio did not thrust His sorrows through—'tis horrible to die! And come down with our little all of dust, That Dun of all the duns to satisfy; To leave life's pleasant city as we must, In Death's most dreary spunging-house to lie, Where even all our personals must go To pay the debt of Nature that we owe! So Julio lived:—'twas nothing but a pet He took at life—a momentary spite; Besides, he hoped that Time would some day get The better of Love's flame, however bright; A thing that Time has never compass'd yet, For Love, we know, is an immortal light; Like that old fire, that, quite beyond a doubt, Was always in,—for none have found it out. Meanwhile, Bianca dream'd—'twas once when Night Along the darken'd plain began to creep, Like a young Hottentot, whose eyes are bright, Altho' in skin as sooty as a sweep: The flow'rs had shut their eyes—the zephyr light Was gone, for it had rock'd the leaves to sleep, And all the little birds had laid their heads Under their wings—sleeping in feather beds. Lone in her chamber sate the dark-eyed maid, By easy stages jaunting through her prayers, But list'ning side-long to a serenade, That robb'd the saints a little of their shares; For Julio underneath the lattice play'd His Deh Vieni, and such amorous airs, Born only underneath Italian skies, Where every fiddle has a Bridge of Sighs. Sweet was the tune—the words were even sweeter— Praising her eyes, her lips, her nose, her hair, With all the common tropes wherewith in metre The hackney poets “overcharge their fair.” Her shape was like Diana's, but completer; Her brow with Grecian Helen's might compare: Cupid, alas! was cruel Sagittarius, Julio—the weeping water-man Aquarius. Now, after listing to such laudings rare, 'Twas very natural indeed to go— What if she did postpone one little pray'r— To ask her mirror “if it was not so?” 'Twas a large mirror, none the worse for wear, Reflecting her at once from top to toe: And there she gazed upon that glossy track, That show'd her front face though it “gave her back.” And long her lovely eyes were held in thrall, By that dear page where first the woman reads: That Julio was no flatt'rer, none at all, She told herself—and then she told her beads; Meanwhile, the nerves insensibly let fall Two curtains fairer than the lily breeds; For Sleep had crept and kiss'd her unawares, Just at the half-way milestone of her pray'rs. Then like a drooping rose so bended she, Till her bow'd head upon her hand reposed; But still she plainly saw, or seem'd to see, That fair reflection, tho' her eyes were closed, A beauty bright as it was wont to be, A portrait Fancy painted while she dozed: 'Tis very natural, some people say, To dream of what we dwell on in the day. Still shone her face—yet not, alas! the same, But 'gan some dreary touches to assume, And sadder thoughts, with sadder changes came— Her eyes resign'd their light, her lips their bloom, Her teeth fell out, her tresses did the same, Her cheeks were tinged with bile, her eyes with rheum: There was a throbbing at her heart within, For, oh! there was a shooting in her chin. And lo! upon her sad desponding brow, The cruel trenches of besieging age, With seams, but most unseemly, 'gan to show Her place was booking for the seventh stage; And where her raven tresses used to flow, Some locks that Time had left her in his rage, And some mock ringlets, made her forehead shady, A compound (like our Psalms) of Tête and Braidy. Then for her shape—alas! how Saturn wrecks, And bends, and corkscrews all the frame about, Doubles the hams, and crooks the straightest necks, Draws in the nape, and pushes forth the snout, Makes backs and stomachs concave or convex: Witness those pensioners call'd In and Out, Who all day watching first and second rater, Quaintly unbend themselves—but grow no straighter. So Time with fair Bianca dealt, and made Her shape a bow, that once was like an arrow; His iron hand upon her spine he laid, And twisted all awry her “winsome marrow.” In truth it was a change!—she had obey'd The holy Pope before her chest grew narrow, But spectacles and palsy seem'd to make her Something between a Glassite and a Quaker. Her grief and gall meanwhile were quite extreme, And she had ample reason for her trouble; For what sad maiden can endure to seem Set in for singleness, though growing double? The fancy madden'd her; but now the dream, Grown thin by getting bigger, like a bubble, Burst,—but still left some fragments of its size, That, like the soapsuds, smarted in her eyes. And here—just here—as she began to heed The real world, her clock chimed out its score; A clock it was of the Venetian breed, That cried the hour from one to twenty-four; The works moreover standing in some need Of workmanship, it struck some dozen more; A warning voice that clench'd Bianca's fears, Such strokes referring doubtless to her years. At fifteen chimes she was but half a nun, By twenty she had quite renounced the veil; She thought of Julio just at twenty-one, And thirty made her very sad and pale, To paint that ruin where her charms would run; At forty all the maid began to fail, And thought no higher, as the late dream cross'd her, Of single blessedness, than single Gloster. And so Bianca changed;—the next sweet even, With Julio in a black Venetian bark, Row'd slow and stealthily—the hour, eleven, Just sounding from the tower of old St. Mark; She sate with eyes turn'd quietly to heav'n, Perchance rejoicing in the grateful dark That veil'd her blushing cheek,—for Julio brought her, Of course, to break the ice upon the water. But what a puzzle is one's serious mind To open;—oysters, when the ice is thick, Are not so difficult and disinclined; And Julio felt the declaration stick About his throat in a most awful kind; However, he contrived by bits to pick His trouble forth,—much like a rotten cork Groped from a long-neck'd bottle with a fork. But love is still the quickest of all readers; And Julio spent besides those signs profuse, That English telegraphs and foreign pleaders, In help of language, are so apt to use:— Arms, shoulders, fingers, all were interceders, Nods, shrugs, and bends,—Bianca could not choose But soften to his suit with more facility, He told his story with so much agility. “Be thou my park, and I will be thy dear,” (So he began at last to speak or quote;) “Be thou my bark, and I thy gondolier,” (For passion takes this figurative note;) “Be thou my light, and I thy chandelier; Be thou my dove, and I will be thy cote; My lily be, and I will be thy river; Be thou my life—and I will be thy liver.” This, with more tender logic of the kind, He pour'd into her small and shell-like ear, That timidly against his lips inclined; Meanwhile her eyes glanced on the silver sphere That even now began to steal behind A dewy vapour, which was lingering near, Wherein the dull moon crept all dim and pale, Just like a virgin putting on the veil:— Bidding adieu to all her sparks—the stars, That erst had woo'd and worshipp'd in her train, Saturn and Hesperus, and gallant Mars— Never to flirt with heavenly eyes again. Meanwhile, remindful of the convent bars, Bianca did not watch these signs in vain, But turn'd to Julio at the dark eclipse, With words, like verbal kisses, on her lips. He took the hint full speedily, and back'd By love, and night, and the occasion's meetness, Bestow'd a something on her cheek that smack'd (Though quite in silence) of ambrosial sweetness; That made her think all other kisses lack'd Till then, but what she knew not, of completeness: Being used but sisterly salutes to feel, Insipid things—like sandwiches of veal. He took her hand, and soon she felt him wring The pretty fingers all instead of one; Anon his stealthy arm began to cling About her waist that had been clasp'd by none: Their dear confessions I forbear to sing, Since cold description would but be outrun; For bliss and Irish watches have the power, In twenty minutes, to lose half an hour! A TRUE STORY. Of all our pains, since man was curst, I mean of body, not the mental, To name the worst, among the worst, The dental sure is transcendental; Some bit of masticating bone, That ought to help to clear a shelf, But lets its proper work alone, And only seems to gnaw itself; In fact, of any grave attack On victuals there is little danger, 'Tis so like coming to the rack, As well as going to the manger. Old Hunks—it seem'd a fit retort Of justice on his grinding ways— Possess'd a grinder of the sort, That troubled all his latter days. The best of friends fall out, and so His teeth had done some years ago, Save some old stumps with ragged root, And they took turn about to shoot; If he drank any chilly liquor, They made it quite a point to throb; But if he warm'd it on the hob, Why then they only twitch'd the quicker. One tooth—I wonder such a tooth Had never kill'd him in his youth— One tooth he had with many fangs, That shot at once as many pangs, It had an universal sting; One touch of that ecstatic stump Could jerk his limbs, and make him jump Just like a puppet on a string; And what was worse than all, it had A way of making others bad. There is, as many know, a knack, With certain farming undertakers, And this same tooth pursued their track, By adding achers still to achers! One way there is, that has been judged A certain cure, but Hunks was loth To pay the fee, and quite begrudged To lose his tooth and money both; In fact, a dentist and the wheel Of Fortune are a kindred cast, For after all is drawn, you feel It's paying for a blank at last: So Hunks went on from week to week, And kept his torment in his cheek. Oh! how it sometimes set him rocking, With that perpetual gnaw—gnaw—gnaw, His moans and groans were truly shocking And loud—although he held his jaw. Many a tug he gave his gum, And tooth, but still it would not come; Though tied by string to some firm thing, He could not draw it, do his best By draw'rs, although he tried a chest. At last, but after much debating, He join'd a score of mouths in waiting, Like his, to have their troubles out. Sad sight it was to look about At twenty faces making faces, With many a rampant trick and antic, For all were very horrid cases, And made their owners nearly frantic. A little wicket now and then Took one of these unhappy men, And out again the victim rush'd, While eyes and mouth together gush'd; At last arrived our hero's turn, Who plunged his hands in both his pockets, And down he sat prepared to learn How teeth are charm'd to quit their sockets. Those who have felt such operations Alone can guess the sort of ache When his old tooth began to break The thread of old associations; It touch'd a string in every part, It had so many tender ties; One chord seem'd wrenching at his heart, And two were tugging at his eyes: “Bone of his bone,” he felt of course, As husbands do in such divorce. At last the fangs gave way a little, Hunks gave his head a backward jerk, And lo! the cause of all this work Went—where it used to send his victual! The monstrous pain of this proceeding Had not so numb'd his miser-wit, But in this slip he saw a hit To save, at least, his purse from bleeding; So when the dentist sought his fees, Quoth Hunks, “Let's finish, if you please.”— “How, finish! why it's out!”—“Oh! no— I'm none of your beforehand tippers, 'Tis you are out, to argue so; My tooth is in my head no doubt, But as you say you pull'd it out, Of course it's there—between your nippers.” “Zounds! sir, d'ye think I'd sell the truth To get a fee? no, wretch, I scorn it.” But Hunks still ask'd to see the tooth, And swore by gum! he had not drawn it. His end obtain'd, he took his leave, A secret chuckle in his sleeve; The joke was worthy to produce one, To think, by favour of his wit, How well a dentist had been bit By one old stump, and that a loose one! The thing was worth a laugh, but mirth Is still the frailest thing on earth: Alas! how often when a joke Seems in our sleeve, and safe enough, There comes some unexpected stroke, And hangs a weeper on the cuff! Hunks had not whistled half a mile When, planted right against the stile, There stood his foeman, Mike Maloney, A vagrant reaper, Irish-born, That help'd to reap our miser's corn, But had not help'd to reap his money, A fact that Hunks remember'd quickly; His whistle all at once was quell'd, And when he saw how Michael held His sickle, he felt rather sickly. Nine souls in ten, with half his fright, Would soon have paid the bill at sight, But misers (let observers watch it) Will never part with their delight Till well demanded by a hatchet— They live hard—and they die to match it. Thus Hunks, prepared for Mike's attacking, Resolved not yet to pay the debt, But let him take it out in hacking. However, Mike began to stickle In word before he used the sickle; But mercy was not long attendant: From words at last he took to blows And aim'd a cut at Hunks's nose, That made it what some folks are not— A Member very independent. Heaven knows how far this cruel trick Might still have led, but for a tramper That came in danger's very nick, To put Maloney to the scamper. But still compassion met a damper; There lay the sever'd nose, alas! Beside the daisies on the grass, “Wee, crimson-tipt” as well as they, According to the poet's lay: And there stood Hunks, no sight for laughter! Away ran Hodge to get assistance, With nose in hand, which Hunks ran after, But somewhat at unusual distance. In many a little country place It is a very common case To have but one residing doctor, Whose practice rather seems to be No practice, but a rule of three, Physician—surgeon—drug-decocter; Thus Hunks was forced to go once more Where he had ta'en his tooth before. His mere name made the learnëd man hot,— “What! Hunks again within my door! I'll pull his nose;” quoth Hunks, “You cannot.” The doctor look'd and saw the case Plain as the nose not on his face. “O! hum—ha—yes—I understand.” But then arose a long demur, For not a finger would he stir Till he was paid his fee in hand; That matter settled, there they were, With Hunks well strapp'd upon his chair. The opening of a surgeon's job, His tools, a chestful, or a drawerful, Are always something very awful, And give the heart the strangest throb; But never patient in his funks Look'd half so like a ghost as Hunks, Or surgeon half so like a devil Prepared for some infernal revel: His huge black eye kept rolling, rolling, Just like a bolus in a box, His fury seem'd above controlling, He bellow'd like a hunted ox: “Now, swindling wretch, I'll show thee how We treat such cheating knaves as thou; Oh! sweet is this revenge to sup; I have thee by the nose—it's now My turn—and I will turn it up.” Guess how the miser liked the scurvy And cruel way of venting passion; The snubbing folks in this new fashion Seem'd quite to turn him topsy turvy; He utter'd prayers, and groans, and curses, For things had often gone amiss And wrong with him before, but this Would be the worst of all reverses! In fancy he beheld his snout Turn'd upward like a pitcher's spout; There was another grievance yet, And fancy did not fail to show it, That he must throw a summerset, Or stand upon his head to blow it. And was there then no argument To change the doctor's vile intent, And move his pity?—yes, in truth, And that was—paying for the tooth. “Zounds! pay for such a stump! I'd rather—” But here the menace went no farther, For with his other ways of pinching, Hunks had a miser's love of snuff, A recollection strong enough To cause a very serious flinching; In short, he paid and had the feature Replaced as it was meant by nature; For though by this 'twas cold to handle, (No corpse's could have felt more horrid,) And white just like an end of candle, The doctor deem'd and proved it too, That noses from the nose will do As well as noses from the forehead; So, fix'd by dint of rag and lint, The part was bandaged up and muffled. The chair unfasten'd, Hunks arose, And shuffled out, for once unshuffled; And as he went these words he snuffled— “Well, this is ‘paying through the nose.’” A PARTHIAN GLANCE. “Sweet Memory, wafted by thy gentle gale, Oft up the stream of time I turn my sail.” —Rogers. Come, my Crony, let's think upon far-away days, And lift up a little Oblivion's veil; Let's consider the past with a lingering gaze, Like a peacock whose eyes are inclined to his tail. Aye, come, let us turn our attention behind, Like those critics whose heads are so heavy, I fear, That they cannot keep up with the march of the mind, And so turn face about for reviewing the rear. Looking over Time's crupper and over his tail, Oh, what ages and pages there are to revise! And as farther our back-searching glances prevail, Like the emmets, “how little we are in our eyes!” What a sweet pretty innocent, half-a-yard long, On a dimity lap of true nursery make! I can fancy I hear the old lullaby song That was meant to compose me, but kept me awake. Methinks I still suffer the infantine throes, When my flesh was a cushion for any long pin— Whilst they patted my body to comfort my woes, Oh! how little they dreamt they were driving them in! Infant sorrows are strong—infant pleasures as weak— But no grief was allow'd to indulge in its note; Did you ever attempt a small “bubble and squeak,” Through the Dalby's Carminative down in your throat? Did you ever go up to the roof with a bounce? Did you ever come down to the floor with the same? Oh! I can't but agree with both ends, and pronounce “Heads or tails,” with a child, an unpleasantish game! Then an urchin—I see myself urchin indeed— With a smooth Sunday face for a mother's delight; Why should weeks have an end?—I am sure there was need Of a Sabbath, to follow each Saturday-night. Was your face ever sent to the housemaid to scrub? Have you ever felt huckaback soften'd with sand? Had you ever your nose towell'd up to a snub, And your eyes knuckled out with the back of the hand? Then a school-boy—my tailor was nothing in fault, For an urchin will grow to a lad by degrees,— But how well I remember that “pepper-and-salt” That was down to the elbows, and up to the knees! What a figure it cut when as Norval I spoke! With a lanky right leg duly planted before; Whilst I told of the chief that was kill'd by my stroke, And extended my arms as “the arms that he wore!” Next a Lover—Oh! say, were you ever in love? With a lady too cold—and your bosom too hot? Have you bow'd to a shoe-tie, and knelt to a glove, Like a beau that desired to be tied in a knot? With the Bride all in white, and your body in blue, Did you walk up the aisle—the genteelest of men? When I think of that beautiful vision anew, Oh! I seem but the biffin of what I was then! I am wither'd and worn by a premature care, And wrinkles confess the decline of my days; Old Time's busy hand has made free with my hair, And I'm seeking to hide it—by writing for bays! A SAILOR'S APOLOGY FOR BOW-LEGS. There's some is born with their straight legs by natur— And some is born with bow-legs from the first— And some that should have grow'd a good deal straighter, But they were badly nursed, And set, you see, like Bacchus, with their pegs Astride of casks and kegs: I've got myself a sort of bow to larboard, And starboard, And this is what it was that warp'd my legs.— 'Twas all along of Poll, as I may say, That foul'd my cable when I ought to slip; But on the tenth of May, When I gets under weigh, Down there in Hertfordshire, to join my ship, I sees the mail Get under sail, The only one there was to make the trip. Well—I gives chase, But as she run Two knots to one, There warn't no use in keeping on the race! Well—casting round about, what next to try on, And how to spin, I spies an ensign with a Bloody Lion, And bears away to leeward for the inn, Beats round the gable, And fetches up before the coach-horse stable: Well—there they stand, four kickers in a row, And so I just makes free to cut a brown 'un's cable. But riding isn't in a seaman's natur— So I whips out a toughish end of yarn, And gets a kind of sort of a land-waiter To splice me, heel to heel, Under the she-mare's keel, And off I goes, and leaves the inn a-starn! My eyes! how she did pitch! And wouldn't keep her own to go in no line, Though I kept bowsing, bowsing at her bow-line, But always making lee-way to the ditch, And yaw'd her head about all sorts of ways. The devil sink the craft! And wasn't she trimendous slack in stays! We couldn't, no how, keep the inn abaft! Well—I suppose We hadn't run a knot—or much beyond— (What will you have on it?)—but off she goes, Up to her bends in a fresh-water pond! There I am!—all a-back! So I looks forward for her bridle-gears, To heave her head round on the t'other tack; But when I starts, The leather parts, And goes away right over by the ears! What could a fellow do Whose legs, like mine, you know, were in the bilboes, But trim myself upright for bringing-to, And square his yard-arms, and brace up his elbows, In rig all snug and clever, Just while his craft was taking in her water? I didn't like my burth though howsomdever, Because the yarn, you see, kept getting tauter,— Says I—I wish this job was rather shorter! The chase had gain'd a mile A-head, and still the she-mare stood a-drinking: Now, all the while Her body didn't take of course to shrinking. Says I, she's letting out her reefs, I'm thinking— And so she swell'd, and swell'd, And yet the tackle held, Till both my legs began to bend like winkin. My eyes! but she took in enough to founder! And there's my timbers straining every bit, Ready to split, And her tarnation hull a-growing rounder? Well, there—off Hartford Ness, We lay both lash'd and water-logg'd together, And can't contrive a signal of distress; Thinks I, we must ride out this here foul weather, Though sick of riding out—and nothing less; When, looking round, I sees a man a-starn:— “Hollo!” says I, “come underneath her quarter!”— And hands him out my knife to cut the yarn. So I gets off, and lands upon the road, And leaves the she-mare to her own consarn, A-standing by the water. If I get on another, I'll be blow'd!— And that's the way, you see, my legs got bow'd! ELEGY ON DAVID LAING, ESQ. BLACKSMITH AND JOINER (WITHOUT LICENSE) AT GRETNA GREEN. Ah me! what causes such complaining breath, Such female moans, and flooding tears to flow? It is to chide with stern, remorseless Death, For laying Laing low! From Prospect House there comes a sound of woe— A shrill and persevering loud lament, Echoed by Mrs. J.'s Establishment “For Six Young Ladies, In a retired and healthy part of Kent.” All weeping, Mr. L? gone down to Hades! Thoughtful of grates, and convents, and the veil! Surrey takes up the tale, And all the nineteen scholars of Miss Jones With the two parlour-boarders and th' apprentice— So universal this mis-timed event is— Are joining sobs and groans! The shock confounds all hymeneal planners And drives the sweetest from their sweet behaviours: The girls at Manor House forget their manners, And utter sighs like paviours! Down—down through Devon and the distant shires Travels the news of Death's remorseless crime; And in all hearts, at once, all hope expires Of matches against time! Along the northern route The road is water'd by postilions' eyes; The topboot paces pensively about, And yellow jackets are all strained with sighs, There is a sound of grieving at the Ship, And sorry hands are wringing at the Bell, In aid of David's knell. The postboy's heart is cracking—not his whip— To gaze upon those useless empty collars His way-worn horses seem so glad to slip— And think upon the dollars That used to urge his gallop—quicker! quicker! All hope is fled, For Laing is dead— Vicar of Wakefield—Edward Gibbon's vicar! The barristers shed tears Enough to feed a snipe (snipes live on suction), To think in after years No suits will come of Gretna Green abduction, Nor knaves inveigle Young heiresses in marriage scrapes or legal. The dull reporters Look truly sad and seriously solemn To lose the future column On Hymen-Smithy and its fond resorters! But grave Miss Daulby and the teaching brood Rejoice at quenching the clandestine flambeau— That never real beau of flesh and blood Will henceforth lure young ladies from their Chambaud. Sleep—David Laing—sleep In peace, though angry governesses spurn thee! Over thy grave a thousand maidens weep, And honest postboys mourn thee! Sleep, David!—safely and serenely sleep, Be-wept of many a learnëd legal eye! To see the mould above thee in a heap Drowns many a lid that heretofore was dry!— Especially of those that, plunging deep In love, would “ride and tie!”— Had I command, thou shouldst have gone thy ways In chaise and pair—and lain in Père-la-Chaise! SONNET. WRITTEN IN A VOLUME OF SHAKSPEARE. How bravely Autumn paints upon the sky The gorgeous fame of Summer which is fled! Hues of all flow'rs, that in their ashes lie, Trophied in that fair light whereon they fed,— Tulip, and hyacinth, and sweet rose red,— Like exhalations from the leafy mould, Look here how honour glorifies the dead, And warms their scutcheons with a glance of gold!— Such is the memory of poets old, Who on Parnassus-hill have bloom'd elate; Now they are laid under their marbles cold, And turn'd to clay, whereof they were create; But god Apollo hath them all enroll'd, And blazon'd on the very clouds of Fate! A RETROSPECTIVE REVIEW. Oh, when I was a tiny boy, My days and nights were full of joy, My mates were blithe and kind!— No wonder that I sometimes sigh, And dash the tear-drop from my eye, To cast a look behind! A hoop was an eternal round Of pleasure. In those days I found A top a joyous thing;— But now those past delights I drop, My head, alas! is all my top, And careful thoughts the string! My marbles—once my bag was stored,— Now I must play with Elgin's lord, With Theseus for a taw! My playful horse has slipt his string, Forgotten all his capering, And harness'd to the law! My kite—how fast and far it flew! Whilst I, a sort of Franklin, drew My pleasure from the sky! 'Twas paper'd o'er with studious themes, The tasks I wrote—my present dreams Will never soar so high! My joys are wingless all and dead; My dumps are made of more than lead; My flights soon find a fall; My fears prevail, my fancies droop, Joy never cometh with a hoop, And seldom with a call! My football's laid upon the shelf; I am a shuttlecock myself The world knocks to and fro;— My archery is all unlearn'd, And grief against myself has turn'd My arrows and my bow! No more in noontide sun I bask; My authorship's an endless task, My head's ne'er out of school: My heart is pain'd with scorn and slight, I have too many foes to fight, And friends grown strangely cool! The very chum that shared my cake Holds out so cold a hand to shake, It makes me shrink and sigh:— On this I will not dwell and hang,— The changeling would not feel a pang Though these should meet his eye! No skies so blue or so serene As then;—no leaves look half so green As clothed the playground tree! All things I loved are alter'd so, Nor does it ease my heart to know That change resides in me! Oh for the garb that mark'd the boy, The trousers made of corduroy, Well ink'd with black and red; The crownless hat, ne'er deem'd an ill— It only let the sunshine still Repose upon my head! Oh for the riband round the neck! The careless dogs'-ears apt to deck My book and collar both! How can this formal man be styled Merely an Alexandrine child, A boy of larger growth? Oh for that small, small beer anew! And (heaven's own type) that mild sky-blue That wash'd my sweet meals down; The master even!—and that small Turk That fagg'd me!—worse is now my work— A fag for all the town! Oh for the lessons learn'd by heart! Ay, though the very birch's smart Should mark those hours again; I'd “kiss the rod,” and be resign'd Beneath the stroke, and even find Some sugar in the cane! The Arabian Nights rehearsed in bed! The Fairy Tales in school-time read, By stealth, 'twixt verb and noun! The angel form that always walk'd In all my dreams, and look'd and talk'd Exactly like Miss Brown! The omne bene—Christmas come! The prize of merit, won for home— Merit had prizes then! But now I write for days and days, For fame—a deal of empty praise, Without the silver pen! Then “home, sweet home!” the crowded coach— The joyous shout—the loud approach— The winding horns like rams'! The meeting sweet that made me thrill, The sweetmeats, almost sweeter still, No ‘satis’ to the ‘jams!’— When that I was a tiny boy My days and nights were full of joy, My mates were blithe and kind! No wonder that I sometimes sigh, And dash the tear-drop from my eye, To cast a look behind! BALLAD. [It was not in the Winter] It was not in the Winter Our loving lot was cast; It was the Time of Roses,— We pluck'd them as we pass'd! That churlish season never frown'd On early lovers yet:— Oh, no—the world was newly crown'd With flowers when first we met! 'Twas twilight, and I bade you go, But still you held me fast; It was the Time of Roses,— We pluck'd them as we pass'd.— What else could peer thy glowing cheek, That tears began to stud? And when I ask'd the like of Love, You snatch'd a damask bud; And oped it to the dainty core, Still glowing to the last.— It was the Time of Roses, We pluck'd them as we pass'd! STANZAS TO TOM WOODGATE, OF HASTINGS. Tom;—are you still within this land Of livers—still on Hastings' sand, Or roaming on the waves? Or has some billow o'er you rolled, Jealous that earth should lap so bold A seaman in her graves? On land the rushlight lives of men Go out but slowly; nine in ten, By tedious long decline— Not so the jolly sailor sinks, Who founders in the wave, and drinks The apoplectic brine! Ay, while I write, mayhap your head Is sleeping on an oyster-bed— I hope 'tis far from truth!— With periwinkle eyes;—your bone Beset with mussels, not your own, And corals at your tooth! Still does the Chance pursue the chance The main affords—the Aidant dance In safety on the tide? Still flies that sign of my good-will A little bunting thing—but still To thee a flag of pride? Does that hard, honest hand now clasp The tiller in its careful grasp— With every summer breeze When ladies sail, in lady-fear— Or, tug the oar, a gondolier On smooth Macadam seas? Or are you where the flounders keep, Some dozen briny fathoms deep, Where sand and shells abound— With some old Triton on your chest, And twelve grave mermen for a 'quest, To find that you are—drown'd? Swift is the wave, and apt to bring A sudden doom—perchance I sing A mere funereal strain; You have endured the utter strife— And are—the same in death or life— A good man ‘in the main’! Oh, no—I hope the old brown eye Still watches ebb, and flood, and sky; That still the brown old shoes Are sucking brine up—pumps indeed!— Your tooth still full of ocean weed, Or Indian—which you choose. I like you, Tom! and in these lays Give honest worth its honest praise, No puff at honour's cost; For though you met these words of mine, All letter-learning was a line You, somehow, never cross'd! Mayhap we ne'er shall meet again, Except on that Pacific main, Beyond this planet's brink; Yet, as we erst have braved the weather, Still may we float awhile together, As comrades on this ink! Many a scudding gale we've had Together, and, my gallant lad, Some perils we have pass'd; When huge and black the wave career'd, And oft the giant surge appear'd The master of our mast;— 'Twas thy example taught me how To climb the billow's hoary brow, Or cleave the raging heap— To bound along the ocean wild, With danger—only as a child The waters rock'd to sleep. Oh, who can tell that brave delight, To see the hissing wave in might Come rampant like a snake! To leap his horrid crest, and feast One's eyes upon the briny beast, Left couchant in the wake! The simple shepherd's love is still To bask upon a sunny hill, The herdsman roams the vale— With both their fancies I agree; Be mine the swelling, scooping sea, That is both hill and dale! I yearn for that brisk spray—I yearn To feel the wave from stem to stern Uplift the plunging keel; That merry step we used to dance On board the Aidant or the Chance, The ocean “toe and heel.” I long to feel the steady gale That fills the broad distended sail— The seas on either hand! My thought, like any hollow shell, Keeps mocking at my ear the swell Of waves against the land. It is no fable—that old strain Of syrens!—so the witching main Is singing—and I sigh! My heart is all at once inclined To seaward—and I seem to find The waters in my eye! Methinks I see the shining beach; The merry waves, each after each, Rebounding o'er the flints; I spy the grim preventive spy! The jolly boatmen standing nigh! The maids in morning chintz! And there they float—the sailing craft! The sail is up—the wind abaft— The ballast trim and neat. Alas! 'tis all a dream—a lie! A printer's imp is standing by, To haul my mizen sheet! My tiller dwindles to a pen— My craft is that of bookish men— My sail—let Longman tell! Adieu, the wave, the wind, the spray! Men—maidens—chintzes—fade away! Tom Woodgate, fare thee well! TIME, HOPE, AND MEMORY. I heard a gentle maiden, in the spring, Set her sweet sighs to music, and thus sing: “Fly through the world, and I will follow thee, Only for looks that may turn back on me; “Only for roses that your chance may throw— Though wither'd—I will wear them on my brow, To be a thoughtful fragrance to my brain,— Warm'd with such love, that they will bloom again. “Thy love before thee, I must tread behind, Kissing thy foot-prints, though to me unkind; But trust not all her fondness, though it seem, Lest thy true love should rest on a false dream. “Her face is smiling, and her voice is sweet; But smiles betray, and music sings deceit; And words speak false;—yet, if they welcome prove, I'll be their echo, and repeat their love. “Only if waken'd to sad truth, at last, The bitterness to come, and sweetness past; When thou art vext, then turn again, and see Thou hast loved Hope, but Memory loved thee.” FLOWERS. I will not have the mad Clytie Whose head is turn'd by the sun; The tulip is a courtly quean, Whom, therefore, I will shun; The cowslip is a country wench, The violet is a nun;— But I will woo the dainty rose, The queen of every one. The pea is but a wanton witch, In too much haste to wed, And clasps her rings on every hand; The wolfsbane I should dread; Nor will I dreary rosemarye, That always mourns the dead;— But I will woo the dainty rose, With her cheeks of tender red. The lily is all in white, like a saint, And so is no mate for me— And the daisy's cheek is tipp'd with a blush, She is of such low degree; Jasmine is sweet, and has many loves, And the broom's betroth'd to the bee;— But I will plight with the dainty rose, For fairest of all is she. BALLAD. [She's up and gone, the graceless girl] She's up and gone, the graceless girl, And robb'd my failing years! My blood before was thin and cold But now 'tis turn'd to tears;— My shadow falls upon my grave, So near the brink I stand, She might have stay'd a little yet, And led me by the hand! Aye, call her on the barren moor, And call her on the hill: 'Tis nothing but the heron's cry, And plover's answer shrill; My child is flown on wilder wings Than they have ever spread, And I may even walk a waste That widen'd when she fled. Full many a thankless child has been, But never one like mine; Her meat was served on plates of gold, Her drink was rosy wine; But now she'll share the robin's food, And sup the common rill, Before her feet will turn again To meet her father's will! RUTH. She stood breast high amid the corn Clasp'd by the golden light of morn, Like the sweetheart of the sun, Who many a glowing kiss had won. On her cheek an autumn flush, Deeply ripen'd;—such a blush In the midst of brown was born, Like red poppies grown with corn. Round her eyes her tresses fell, Which were blackest none could tell, But long lashes veil'd a light, That had else been all too bright, And her hat, with shady brim, Made her tressy forehead dim;— Thus she stood amid the stooks, Praising God with sweetest looks:— Sure, I said, Heav'n did not mean, Where I reap thou shouldst but glean, Lay thy sheaf adown and come, Share my harvest and my home. THE PLEA OF THE MIDSUMMER FAIRIES. 'Twas in that mellow season of the year When the hot sun singes the yellow leaves Till they be gold,—and with a broader sphere The Moon looks down on Ceres and her sheaves; When more abundantly the spider weaves, And the cold wind breathes from a chillier clime;— That forth I fared, on one of those still eves, Touch'd with the dewy sadness of the time, To think how the bright months had spent their prime, So that, wherever I address'd my way, I seem'd to track the melancholy feet Of him that is the Father of Decay, And spoils at once the sour weed and the sweet;— Wherefore regretfully I made retreat To some unwasted regions of my brain, Charm'd with the light of summer and the heat, And bade that bounteous season bloom again, And sprout fresh flowers in mine own domain. It was a shady and sequester'd scene, Like those famed gardens of Boccaccio, Planted with his own laurels ever green, And roses that for endless summer blow; And there were fountain springs to overflow Their marble basins,—and cool green arcades Of tall o'erarching sycamores, to throw Athwart the dappled path their dancing shades,— With timid coneys cropping the green blades. And there were crystal pools, peopled with fish, Argent and gold; and some of Tyrian skin, Some crimson-barr'd;—and ever at a wish They rose obsequious till the wave grew thin As glass upon their backs, and then dived in, Quenching their ardent scales in watery gloom; Whilst others with fresh hues row'd forth to win My changeable regard,—for so we doom Things born of thought to vanish or to bloom. And there were many birds of many dyes, From tree to tree still faring to and fro, And stately peacocks with their splendid eyes, And gorgeous pheasants with their golden glow, Like Iris just bedabbled in her bow, Besides some vocalists without a name, That oft on fairy errands come and go, With accents magical;—and all were tame, And peckëd at my hand where'er I came. And for my sylvan company, in lieu Of Pampinea with her lively peers, Sate Queen Titania with her pretty crew, All in their liveries quaint, with elfin gears, For she was gracious to my childish years, And made me free of her enchanted round; Wherefore this dreamy scene she still endears, And plants her court upon a verdant mound, Fenced with umbrageous woods and groves profound. “Ah me,” she cries, “was ever moonlight seen So clear and tender for our midnight trips? Go some one forth, and with a trump convene My lieges all!”—Away the goblin skips A pace or two apart, and deftly strips The ruddy skin from a sweet rose's cheek, Then blows the shuddering leaf between his lips, Making it utter forth a shrill small shriek, Like a fray'd bird in the grey owlet's beak. And lo! upon my fix'd delighted ken Appear'd the loyal Fays.—Some by degrees Crept from the primrose buds that open'd then, And some from bell-shaped blossoms like the bees, Some from the dewy meads, and rushy leas, Flew up like chafers when the rustics pass; Some from the rivers, others from tall trees Dropp'd, like shed blossoms, silent to the grass, Spirits and elfins small, of every class. Peri and Pixy, and quaint Puck the Antic, Brought Robin Goodfellow, that merry swain; And stealthy Mab, queen of old realms romantic, Came too, from distance, in her tiny wain, Fresh dripping from a cloud—some bloomy rain, Then circling the bright Moon, had wash'd her car, And still bedew'd it with a various stain: Lastly came Ariel, shooting from a star, Who bears all fairy embassies afar. But Oberon, that night elsewhere exiled, Was absent, whether some distemper'd spleen Kept him and his fair mate unreconciled, Or warfare with the Gnome (whose race had been Sometime obnoxious), kept him from his queen, And made her now peruse the starry skies Prophetical, with such an absent mien; Howbeit, the tears stole often to her eyes, And oft the Moon was incensed with her sighs— Which made the elves sport drearily, and soon Their hushing dances languish'd to a stand, Like midnight leaves, when, as the Zephyrs swoon, All on their drooping stems they sink unfann'd,— So into silence droop'd the fairy band, To see their empress dear so pale and still Crowding her softly round on either hand, As pale as frosty snowdrops, and as chill, To whom the sceptred dame reveals her ill. “Alas,” quoth she, “ye know our fairy lives Are leased upon the fickle faith of men; Not measured out against Fate's mortal knives, Like human gossamers,—we perish when We fade and are forgot in worldly ken,— Though poesy has thus prolong'd our date Thanks be to the sweet Bard's auspicious pen That rescued us so long!—howbeit of late I feel some dark misgivings of our fate. “And this dull day my melancholy sleep Hath been so thronged with images of woe, That even now I cannot choose but weep To think this was some sad prophetic show Of future horror to befall us so,— Of mortal wreck and uttermost distress,— Yea, our poor empire's fall and overthrow,— For this was my long vision's dreadful stress, And when I waked my trouble was not less. “Whenever to the clouds I tried to seek, Such leaden weight dragg'd these Icarian wings, My faithless wand was wavering and weak, And slimy toads had trespass'd in our rings— The birds refused to sing for me—all things Disown'd their old allegiance to our spells; The rude bees prick'd me with their rebel stings; And, when I pass'd, the valley-lily's bells Rang out, methought, most melancholy knells. “And ever on the faint and flagging air A doleful spirit with a dreary note Cried in my fearful ear, ‘Prepare! prepare!’ Which soon I knew came from a raven's throat, Perch'd on a cypress-bough not far remote,— A cursed bird, too crafty to be shot, That alway cometh with his soot-black coat To make hearts dreary:—for he is a blot Upon the book of life, as well ye wot!— “Wherefore some while I bribed him to be mute, With bitter acorns stuffing his foul maw, Which barely I appeased, when some fresh bruit Startled me all aheap!—and soon I saw The horridest shape that ever raised my awe,— A monstrous giant, very huge and tall, Such as in elder times, devoid of law, With wicked might grieved the primeval ball, And this was sure the deadliest of them all! “Gaunt was he as a wolf of Languedoc, With bloody jaws, and frost upon his crown; So from his barren poll one hoary lock Over his wrinkled front fell far adown, Well nigh to where his frosty brows did frown Like jaggëd icicles at cottage eaves; And for his coronal he wore some brown And bristled ears gather'd from Ceres' sheaves, Entwined with certain sere and russet leaves. “And lo! upon a mast rear'd far aloft, He bore a very bright and crescent blade, The which he waved so dreadfully, and oft, In meditative spite, that, sore dismay'd, I crept into an acorn-cup for shade; Meanwhile the horrid effigy went by: I trow his look was dreadful, for it made The trembling birds betake them to the sky, For every leaf was lifted by his sigh. “And ever, as he sigh'd, his foggy breath Blurr'd out the landscape like a flight of smoke: Thence knew I this was either dreary Death Or Time, who leads all creatures to his stroke. Ah wretched me!”—Here, even as she spoke, The melancholy Shape came gliding in, And lean'd his back against an antique oak, Folding his wings, that were so fine and thin, They scarce were seen against the Dryad's skin. Then what a fear seized all the little rout! Look how a flock of panic'd sheep will stare— And huddle close—and start—and wheel about, Watching the roaming mongrel here and there,— So did that sudden Apparition scare All close aheap those small affrighted things; Nor sought they now the safety of the air, As if some leaden spell withheld their wings; But who can fly that ancientest of Kings? Whom now the Queen, with a forestalling tear And previous sigh, beginneth to entreat, Bidding him spare, for love, her lieges dear: “Alas!” quoth she, “is there no nodding wheat Ripe for thy crooked weapon, and more meet,— Or wither'd leaves to ravish from the tree,— Or crumbling battlements for thy defeat? Think but what vaunting monuments there be Builded in spite and mockery of thee. “O fret away the fabric walls of Fame, And grind down marble Cæsars with the dust: Make tombs inscriptionless—raze each high name, And waste old armours of renown with rust: Do all of this, and thy revenge is just: Make such decays the trophies of thy prime, And check Ambition's overweening lust, That dares exterminating war with Time,— But we are guiltless of that lofty crime. “Frail feeble sprites!—the children of a dream! Leased on the sufferance of fickle men, Like motes dependent on the sunny beam, Living but in the sun's indulgent ken, And when that light withdraws, withdrawing then;— So do we flutter in the glance of youth And fervid fancy,—and so perish when The eye of faith grows agëd;—in sad truth, Feeling thy sway, O Time! though not thy tooth! “Where be those old divinities forlorn, That dwelt in trees, or haunted in a stream? Alas! their memories are dimm'd and torn, Like the remainder tatters of a dream: So will it fare with our poor thrones, I deem;— For us the same dark trench Oblivion delves, That holds the wastes of every human scheme. O spare us then,—and these our pretty elves,— We soon, alas! shall perish of ourselves!” Now as she ended, with a sigh, to name Those old Olympians, scatter'd by the whirl Of Fortune's giddy wheel and brought to shame, Methought a scornful and malignant curl Show'd on the lips of that malicious churl, To think what noble havocs he had made; So that I fear'd he all at once would hurl The harmless fairies into endless shade,— Howbeit he stopp'd awhile to whet his blade. Pity it was to hear the elfins' wail Rise up in concert from their mingled dread Pity it was to see them, all so pale, Gaze on the grass as for a dying bed;— But Puck was seated on a spider's thread. That hung between two branches of a briar, And 'gan to swing and gambol, heels o'er head, Like any Southwark tumbler on a wire, For him no present grief could long inspire. Meanwhile the Queen with many piteous drops, Falling like tiny sparks full fast and free, Bedews a pathway from her throne;—and stops Before the foot of her arch enemy, And with her little arms enfolds his knee, That shows more grisly from that fair embrace; But she will ne'er depart. “Alas!” quoth she, “My painful fingers I will here enlace Till I have gain'd your pity for our race. “What have we ever done to earn this grudge, And hate—(if not too humble for thy hating?)— Look o'er our labours and our lives, and judge If there be any ills of our creating; For we are very kindly creatures, dating With nature's charities still sweet and bland:— O think this murder worthy of debating!” Herewith she makes a signal with her hand, To beckon some one from the Fairy band. Anon I saw one of those elfin things, Clad all in white like any chorister, Come fluttering forth on his melodious wings, That made soft music at each little stir, But something louder than a bee's demur Before he lights upon a bunch of broom, And thus 'gan he with Saturn to confer,— And O his voice was sweet, touch'd with the gloom Of that sad theme that argued of his doom! Quoth he, “We make all melodies our care, That no false discords may offend the Sun, Music's great master—tuning everywhere All pastoral sounds and melodies, each one Duly to place and season, so that none May harshly interfere. We rouse at morn The shrill sweet lark; and when the day is done, Hush silent pauses for the bird forlorn, That singeth with her breast against a thorn. “We gather in loud choirs the twittering race, That make a chorus with their single note; And tend on new-fledged birds in every place, That duly they may get their tunes by rote; And oft, like echoes, answering remote, We hide in thickets from the feather'd throng, And strain in rivalship each throbbing throat, Singing in shrill responses all day long, Whilst the glad truant listens to our song. “Wherefore, great King of Years, as thou dost love The raining music from a morning cloud, When vanish'd larks are carolling above, To wake Apollo with their pipings loud;— If ever thou hast heard in leafy shroud The sweet and plaintive Sappho of the dell, Show thy sweet mercy on this little crowd, And we will muffle up the sheepfold bell Whene'er thou listenest to Philomel.” Then Saturn thus:—“Sweet is the merry lark, That carols in man's ear so clear and strong; And youth must love to listen in the dark That tuneful elegy of Tereus' wrong; But I have heard that ancient strain too long, For sweet is sweet but when a little strange, And I grow weary for some newer song; For wherefore had I wings, unless to range Through all things mutable, from change to change? “But wouldst thou hear the melodies of Time, Listen when sleep and drowsy darkness roll Over hush'd cities, and the midnight chime Sounds from their hundred clocks, and deep bells toll Like a last knell over the dead world's soul, Saying, ‘Time shall be final of all things, Whose late, last voice must elegise the whole,’— O then I clap aloft my brave broad wings, And make the wide air tremble while it rings!” Then next a fair Eve-Fay made meek address, Saying, “We be the handmaids of the Spring; In sign whereof, May, the quaint broideress, Hath wrought her samplers on our gauzy wing. We tend upon buds' birth and blossoming, And count the leafy tributes that they owe— As, so much to the earth—so much to fling In showers to the brook—so much to go In whirlwinds to the clouds that made them grow. “The pastoral cowslips are our little pets, And daisy stars, whose firmament is green; Pansies, and those veil'd nuns, meek violets, Sighing to that warm world from which they screen; And golden daffodils, pluck'd for May's Queen; And lonely harebells, quaking on the heath; And Hyacinth, long since a fair youth seen, Whose tuneful voice, turn'd fragrance in his breath, Kiss'd by sad Zephyr, guilty of his death. “The widow'd primrose weeping to the moon And saffron crocus in whose chalice bright A cool libation hoarded for the noon Is kept—and she that purifies the light, The virgin lily, faithful to her white, Whereon Eve wept in Eden for her shame; And the most dainty rose, Aurora's spright, Our every godchild, by whatever name— Spare us our lives, for we did nurse the same!” Then that old Mower stamp'd his heel, and struck His hurtful scythe against the harmless ground, Saying, “Ye foolish imps, when am I stuck With gaudy buds, or like a wooer crown'd With flow'ry chaplets, save when they are found Wither'd?—Whenever have I pluck'd a rose, Except to scatter its vain leaves around? For so all gloss of beauty I oppose, And bring decay on every flow'r that blows. “Or when am I so wroth as when I view The wanton pride of Summer;—how she decks The birthday world with blossoms ever-new, As if Time had not lived, and heap'd great wrecks Of years on years?—O then I bravely vex And catch the gay Months in their gaudy plight, And slay them with the wreaths about their necks, Like foolish heifers in the holy rite, And raise great trophies to my ancient might.” Then saith another, “We are kindly things, And like her offspring nestle with the dove,— Witness these hearts embroider'd on our wings, To show our constant patronage of love:— We sit at even, in sweet bow'rs above Lovers, and shake rich odours on the air, To mingle with their sighs; and still remove The startling owl, and bid the bat forbear Their privacy, and haunt some other where. “And we are near the mother when she sits Beside her infant in its wicker bed; And we are in the fairy scene that flits Across its tender brain: sweet dreams we shed, And whilst the little merry soul is fled Away, to sport with our young elves, the while We touch the dimpled cheek with roses red, And tickle the soft lips until they smile, So that their careful parents they beguile. “O then, if ever thou hast breathed a vow At Love's dear portal, or at pale moon-rise Crush'd the dear curl on a regardful brow, That did not frown thee from thy honey prize— If ever thy sweet son sat on thy thighs, And wooed thee from thy careful thoughts within To watch the harmless beauty of his eyes, Or glad thy fingers on his smooth soft skin, For Love's dear sake, let us thy pity win!” Then Saturn fiercely thus:—“What joy have I In tender babes, that have devour'd mine own, Whenever to the light I heard them cry, Till foolish Rhea cheated me with stone? Whereon, till now, is my great hunger shown, In monstrous dint of my enormous tooth; And—but the peopled world is too full grown For hunger's edge—I would consume all youth At one great meal, without delay or ruth! “For I am well nigh crazed and wild to hear How boastful fathers taunt me with their breed, Saying, ‘We shall not die nor disappear, But, in these other selves, ourselves succeed Ev'n as ripe flowers pass into their seed Only to be renew'd from prime to prime,’ All of which boastings I am forced to read, Besides a thousand challenges to Time, Which bragging lovers have compiled in rhyme. “Wherefore, when they are sweetly met o'nights, There will I steal and with my hurried hand Startle them suddenly from their delights Before the next encounter hath been plann'd, Ravishing hours in little minutes spann'd; But when they say farewell, and grieve apart, Then like a leaden statue I will stand, Meanwhile their many tears encrust my dart, And with a ragged edge cut heart from heart.” Then next a merry Woodsman, clad in green, Stept vanward from his mates, that idly stood Each at his proper ease, as they had been Nursed in the liberty of old Shérwood, And wore the livery of Robin Hood, Who wont in forest shades to dine and sup,— So came this chief right frankly, and made good His haunch against his axe, and thus spoke up, Doffing his cap, which was an acorn's cup:— “We be small foresters and gay, who tend On trees, and all their furniture of green, Training the young boughs airily to bend, And show blue snatches of the sky between;— Or knit more close intricacies, to screen Birds' crafty dwellings, as may hide them best, But most the timid blackbird's—she that, seen, Will bear black poisonous berries to her nest, Lest man should cage the darlings of her breast. “We bend each tree in proper attitude, And founting willows train in silvery falls; We frame all shady roofs and arches rude, And verdant aisles leading to Dryads' halls, Or deep recesses where the Echo calls;— We shape all plumy trees against the sky, And carve tall elms' Corinthian capitals,— When sometimes, as our tiny hatchets ply, Men say, the tapping woodpecker is nigh. “Sometimes we scoop the squirrel's hollow cell, And sometimes carve quaint letters on trees' rind. That haply some lone musing wight may spell Dainty Aminta,—Gentle Rosalind,— Or chastest Laura,—sweetly call'd to mind In sylvan solitudes, ere he lies down;— And sometimes we enrich grey stems with twined And vagrant ivy,—or rich moss, whose brown Burns into gold as the warm sun goes down. “And, lastly, for mirth's sake and Christmas cheer, We bear the seedling berries, for increase, To graft the Druid oaks, from year to year, Careful that mistletoe may never cease;— Wherefore, if thou dost prize the shady peace Of sombre forests, or to see light break Through sylvan cloisters, and in spring release Thy spirit amongst leaves from careful ake, Spare us our lives for the Green Dryad's sake.” Then Saturn, with a frown:—“Go forth, and fell Oak for your coffins, and thenceforth lay by Your axes for the rust, and bid farewell To all sweet birds, and the blue peeps of sky Through tangled branches, for ye shall not spy The next green generation of the tree; But hence with the dead leaves, whene'er they fly,— Which in the bleak air I would rather see, Than flights of the most tuneful birds that be. “For I dislike all prime, and verdant pets, Ivy except, that on the aged wall Preys with its worm-like roots, and daily frets The crumbled tower it seems to league withal, King-like, worn down by its own coronal:— Neither in forest haunts love I to won, Before the golden plumage 'gins to fall, And leaves the brown bleak limbs with few leaves on, Or bare—like Nature in her skeleton. “For then sit I amongst the crooked boughs, Wooing dull Memory with kindred sighs; And there in rustling nuptials we espouse, Smit by the sadness in each other's eyes;— But Hope must have green bowers and blue skies, And must be courted with the gauds of Spring; Whilst Youth leans god-like on her lap, and cries, ‘What shall we always do, but love and sing?’— And Time is reckon'd a discarded thing.” Here in my dream it made me fret to see How Puck, the antic, all this dreary while Had blithely jested with calamity, With mis-timed mirth mocking the doleful style Of his sad comrades, till it raised my bile To see him so reflect their grief aside, Turning their solemn looks to half a smile— Like a straight stick shown crooked in the tide;— But soon a novel advocate I spied. Quoth he—“We teach all natures to fulfil Their fore-appointed crafts, and instincts meet,— The bee's sweet alchemy,—the spider's skill,— The pismire's care to garner up his wheat,— And rustic masonry to swallows fleet,— The lapwing's cunning to preserve her nest,— But most, that lesser pelican, the sweet And shrilly ruddock, with its bleeding breast, Its tender pity of poor babes distrest. “Sometimes we cast our shapes, and in sleek skins Delve with the timid mole, that aptly delves From our example; so the spider spins, And eke the silk-worm, pattern'd by ourselves: Sometimes we travail on the summer shelves Of early bees, and busy toils commence, Watch'd of wise men, that know not we are elves, But gaze and marvel at our stretch of sense, And praise our human-like intelligence. “Wherefore, by thy delight in that old tale, And plaintive dirges the late robins sing, What time the leaves are scatter'd by the gale, Mindful of that old forest burying;— As thou dost love to watch each tiny thing, For whom our craft most curiously contrives, If thou hast caught a bee upon the wing, To take his honey-bag,—spare us our lives, And we will pay the ransom in full hives.” “Now by my glass,” quoth Time, “ye do offend In teaching the brown bees that careful lore, And frugal ants, whose millions would have end, But they lay up for need a timely store, And travail with the seasons evermore; Whereas Great Mammoth long hath pass'd away, And none but I can tell what hide he wore; Whilst purblind men, the creatures of a day, In riddling wonder his great bones survey.” Then came an elf, right beauteous to behold, Whose coat was like a brooklet that the sun Hath all embroider'd with its crooked gold, It was so quaintly wrought and overrun With spangled traceries,—most meet for one That was a warden of the pearly streams;— And as he stept out of the shadows dun, His jewels sparkled in the pale moon's gleams, And shot into the air their pointed beams. Quoth he,—“We bear the gold and silver keys Of bubbling springs and fountains, that below Course thro' the veiny earth,—which when they freeze Into hard crysolites, we bid to flow, Creeping like subtle snakes, when, as they go, We guide their windings to melodious falls, At whose soft murmurings, so sweet and low, Poets have tuned their smoothest madrigals, To sing to ladies in their banquet-halls. “And when the hot sun with his steadfast heat Parches the river god,—whose dusty urn Drips miserly, till soon his crystal feet Against his pebbly floor wax faint and burn, And languid fish, unpoised, grow sick and yearn,— Then scoop we hollows in some sandy nook, And little channels dig, wherein we turn The thread-worn rivulet, that all forsook The Naiad-lily, pining for her brook. “Wherefore, by thy delight in cool green meads. With living sapphires daintily inlaid,— In all soft songs of waters and their reeds,— And all reflections in a streamlet made, Haply of thy own love, that, disarray'd, Kills the fair lily with a livelier white,— By silver trouts upspringing from green shade, And winking stars reduplicate at night, Spare us, poor ministers to such delight.” Howbeit his pleading and his gentle looks Moved not the spiteful Shade:—Quoth he, “Your taste Shoots wide of mine, for I despise the brooks And slavish rivulets that run to waste In noontide sweats, or, like poor vassals, haste To swell the vast dominion of the sea, In whose great presence I am held disgraced, And neighbour'd with a king that rivals me In ancient might and hoary majesty. “Whereas I ruled in Chaos, and still keep The awful secrets of that ancient dearth, Before the briny fountains of the deep Brimm'd up the hollow cavities of earth;— I saw each trickling Sea-God at his birth, Each pearly Naiad with her oozy locks, And infant Titans of enormous girth, Whose huge young feet yet stumbled on the rocks, Stunning the early world with frequent shocks. “Where now is Titan, with his cumbrous brood, That scared the world?—By this sharp scythe they fell, And half the sky was curdled with their blood: So have all primal giants sigh'd farewell. No wardens now by sedgy fountains dwell, Nor pearly Naiads. All their days are done That strove with Time, untimely, to excel; Wherefore I razed their progenies, and none But my great shadow intercepts the sun!” Then saith the timid Fay—“Oh, mighty Time! Well hast thou wrought the cruel Titans' fall, For they were stain'd with many a bloody crime: Great giants work great wrongs,—but we are small, For love goes lowly;—but Oppression's tall, And with surpassing strides goes foremost still Where love indeed can hardly reach at all; Like a poor dwarf o'erburthen'd with good will, That labours to efface the tracks of ill.— “Man even strives with Man, but we eschew The guilty feud, and all fierce strifes abhor; Nay, we are gentle as the sweet heaven's dew Beside the red and horrid drops of war, Weeping the cruel hates men battle for, Which wordly bosoms nourish in our spite: For in the gentle breast we ne'er withdraw, But only when all love hath taken flight, And youth's warm gracious heart is harden'd quite. “So are our gentle natures intertwined With sweet humanities, and closely knit In kindly sympathy with human kind. Witness how we befriend, with elfin wit, All hopeless maids and lovers,—nor omit Magical succours unto hearts forlorn:— We charm man's life, and do not perish it;— So judge us by the helps we showed this morn, To one who held his wretched days in scorn. “'Twas nigh sweet Amwell;—for the Queen had task'd Our skill to-day amidst the silver Lea, Whereon the noontide sun had not yet bask'd; Wherefore some patient man we thought to see, Planted in moss-grown rushes to the knee, Beside the cloudy margin cold and dim;— Howbeit no patient fisherman was he That cast his sudden shadow from the brim, Making us leave our toils to gaze on him. “His face was ashy pale, and leaden care Had sunk the levell'd arches of his brow, Once bridges, for his joyous thoughts to fare Over those melancholy springs and slow, That from his piteous eyes began to flow, And fell anon into the chilly stream; Which, as his mimick'd image show'd below, Wrinkled his face with many a needless seam, Making grief sadder in its own esteem. “And lo! upon the air we saw him stretch His passionate arms; and, in a wayward strain, He 'gan to elegize that fellow wretch That with mute gestures answer'd him again, Saying, ‘Poor slave, how long wilt thou remain Life's sad weak captive in a prison strong, Hoping with tears to rust away thy chain, In bitter servitude to worldly wrong?— Thou wear'st that mortal livery too long!’ “This, with more spleenful speeches and some tears, When he had spent upon the imaged wave, Speedily I convened my elfin peers Under the lily-cups, that we might save This woeful mortal from a wilful grave By shrewd diversions of his mind's regret, Seeing he was mere Melancholy's slave, That sank wherever a dark cloud he met, And straight was tangled in her secret net. “Therefore, as still he watch'd the water's flow, Daintily we transform'd, and with bright fins Came glancing through the gloom; some from below Rose like dim fancies when a dream begins, Snatching the light upon their purple skins; Then under the broad leaves made slow retire: One like a golden galley bravely wins Its radiant course,—another glows like fire,— Making that wayward man our pranks admire. “And so he banish'd thought, and quite forgot All contemplation of that wretched face; And so we wiled him from that lonely spot Along the river's brink; till, by heaven's grace, He met a gentle haunter of the place, Full of sweet wisdom gather'd from the brooks, Who there discuss'd his melancholy case With wholesome texts learn'd from kind nature's books, Meanwhile he newly trimm'd his lines and hooks.” Herewith the Fairy ceased. Quoth Ariel now— “Let me remember how I saved a man. Whose fatal noose was fasten'd on a bough, Intended to abridge his sad life's span: For haply I was by when he began His stern soliloquy in life's dispraise, And overheard his melancholy plan, How he had made a vow to end his days. And therefore follow'd him in all his ways, “Through brake and tangled copse, for much he loathed All populous haunts, and roam'd in forests rude, To hide himself from man. But I had clothed My delicate limbs with plumes, and still pursued, Where only foxes and wild cats intrude, Till we were come beside an ancient tree Late blasted by a storm. Here he renew'd His loud complaints,—choosing that spot to be The scene of his last horrid tragedy. “It was a wild and melancholy glen, Made gloomy by tall firs and cypress dark, Whose roots, like any bones of buried men, Push'd through the rotten sod for fear's remark; A hundred horrid stems, jagged and stark, Wrestled with crooked arms in hideous fray, Besides sleek ashes with their dappled bark, Like crafty serpents climbing for a prey, With many blasted oaks moss-grown and grey. “But here upon his final desperate clause Suddenly I pronounced so sweet a strain, Like a pang'd nightingale, it made him pause, Till half the frenzy of his grief was slain. The sad remamder oozing from his brain In timely ecstasies of healing tears, Which through his ardent eyes began to drain;— Meanwhile the deadly Fates unclosed their shears:— So pity me and all my fated peers!” Thus Ariel ended, and was some time hush'd: When with the hoary shape a fresh tongue pleads, And red as rose the gentle Fairy blush'd To read the records of her own good deeds:— “It chanced,” quoth she, “in seeking through the meads For honied cowslips, sweetest in the morn, Whilst yet the buds were hung with dewy beads, And Echo answer'd to the huntsman's horn, We found a babe left in the swarths forlorn. “A little, sorrowful, deserted thing, Begot of love, and yet no love begetting; Guiltless of shame, and yet for shame to wring; And too soon banish'd from a mother's petting, To churlish nurture and the wide world's fretting, For alien pity and unnatural care;— Alas! to see how the cold dew kept wetting His childish coats, and dabbled all his hair, Like gossamers across his forehead fair. “His pretty pouting mouth, witless of speech, Lay half-way open like a rose-lipp'd shell; And his young cheek was softer than a peach, Whereon his tears, for roundness, could not dwell, But quickly roll'd themselves to pearls, and fell, Some on the grass, and some against his hand, Or haply wander'd to the dimpled well, Which love beside his mouth had sweetly plann'd, Yet not for tears, but mirth and smilings bland. “Pity it was to see those frequent tears Falling regardless from his friendless eyes; There was such beauty in those twin blue spheres, As any mother's heart might leap to prize; Blue were they, like the zenith of the skies Soften'd betwixt two clouds, both clear and mild;— Just touch'd with thought, and yet not over wise, They show'd the gentle spirit of a child, Not yet by care or any craft defiled. “Pity it was to see the ardent sun Scorching his helpless limbs—it shone so warm; For kindly shade or shelter he had none, Nor mother's gentle breast, come fair or storm. Meanwhile I bade my pitying mates transform Like grasshoppers, and then, with shrilly cries, All round the infant noisily we swarm, Haply some passing rustic to advise— Whilst providential Heaven our care espies, “And sends full soon a tender-hearted hind, Who, wond'ring at our loud unusual note, Strays curiously aside, and so doth find The orphan child laid in the grass remote, And laps the foundling in his russet coat, Who thence was nurtured in his kindly cot:— But how he prosper'd let proud London quote, How wise, how rich, and how renown'd he got, And chief of all her citizens, I wot. “Witness his goodly vessels on the Thames, Whose holds were fraught with costly merchandise,— Jewels from Ind, and pearls for courtly dames, And gorgeous silks that Samarcand supplies: Witness that Royal Bourse he bade arise, The mart of merchants from the East and West; Whose slender summit, pointing to the skies, Still bears, in token of his grateful breast, The tender grasshopper, his chosen crest— “The tender grasshopper, his chosen crest, That all the summer, with a tuneful wing, Makes merry chirpings in its grassy nest, Inspirited with dew to leap and sing:— So let us also live, eternal King! Partakers of the green and pleasant earth:— Pity it is to slay the meanest thing, That, like a mote, shines in the smile of mirth:— Enough there is of joy's decrease and dearth! “Enough of pleasure, and delight, and beauty, Perish'd and gone, and hasting to decay;— Enough to sadden even thee, whose duty Or spite it is to havoc and to slay: Too many a lovely race razed quite away, Hath left large gaps in life and human loving:— Here then begin thy cruel war to stay, And spare fresh sighs, and tears, and groans, reproving Thy desolating hand for our removing.” Now here I heard a shrill and sudden cry, And, looking up. I saw the antic Puck Grappling with Time, who clutch'd him like a fly, Victim of his own sport,—the jester's luck! He, whilst his fellows grieved, poor wight, had stuck His freakish gauds upon the Ancient's brow, And now his ear, and now his beard, would pluck; Whereas the angry churl had snatch'd him now, Crying, “Thou impish mischief, who art thou?” “Alas!” quoth Puck, “a little random elf, Born in the sport of nature, like a weed, For simple sweet enjoyment of myself, But for no other purpose, worth, or need; And yet withal of a most happy breed; And there is Robin Goodfellow besides, My partner dear in many a prankish deed To make dame Laughter hold her jolly sides, Like merry mummers twain on holy tides. “'Tis we that bob the angler's idle cork, Till e'en the patient man breathes half a curse; We steal the morsel from the gossip's fork, And curdling looks with secret straws disperse. Or stop the sneezing chanter at mid verse: And when an infant's beauty prospers ill, We change, some mothers say, the child at nurse: But any graver purpose to fulfil, We have not wit enough, and scarce the will. “We never let the canker melancholy To gather on our faces like a rust, But gloss our features with some change of folly, Taking life's fabled miseries on trust, But only sorrowing when sorrow must: We ruminate no sage's solemn cud, But own ourselves a pinch of lively dust To frisk upon a wind,—whereas the flood Of tears would turn us into heavy mud. “Beshrew those sad interpreters of nature, Who gloze her lively universal law, As if she had not form'd our cheerful feature To be so tickled with the slightest straw! So let them vex their mumping mouths, and draw The corners downward, like a wat'ry moon, And deal in gusty sighs and rainy flaw— We will not woo foul weather all too soon, Or nurse November on the lap of June. “For ours are winging sprites, like any bird, That shun all stagnant settlements of grief; And even in our rest our hearts are stirr'd, Like insects settled on a dancing leaf:— This is our small philosophy in brief, Which thus to teach hath set me all agape: But dost thou relish it? O hoary chief! Unclasp thy crooked fingers from my nape, And I will show thee many a pleasant scrape.” Then Saturn thus:—shaking his crooked blade O'erhead, which made aloft a lightning flash In all the fairies' eyes, dismally fray'd! His ensuing voice came like the thunder crash— Meanwhile the bolt shatters some pine or ash— “Thou feeble, wanton, foolish, fickle thing! Whom nought can frighten, sadden, or abash,— To hope my solemn countenance to wring To idiot smiles!—but I will prune thy wing! “Lo! this most awful handle of my scythe Stood once a May-pole, with a flowery crown, Which rustics danced around, and maidens blithe, To wanton pipings;—but I pluck'd it down, And robed the May Queen in a churchyard gown, Turning her buds to rosemary and rue; And all their merry minstrelsy did drown, And laid each lusty leaper in the dew;— So thou shalt fare—and every jovial crew!” Here he lets go the struggling imp, to clutch His mortal engine with each grisly hand, Which frights the elfin progeny so much, They huddle in a heap, and trembling stand All round Titania, like the queen bee's band, With sighs and tears and very shrieks of woe!— Meanwhile, some moving argument I plann'd, To make the stern Shade merciful,—when lo! He drops his fatal scythe without a blow! For, just at need, a timely Apparition Steps in between, to bear the awful brunt; Making him change his horrible position, To marvel at this comer, brave and blunt, That dares Time's irresistible affront, Whose strokes have scarr'd even the gods of old;— Whereas this seem'd a mortal, at mere hunt For coneys, lighted by the moonshine cold, Or stalker of stray deer, stealthy and bold. Who, turning to the small assembled fays, Doffs to the lily queen his courteous cap, And holds her beauty for a while in gaze, With bright eyes kindling at this pleasant hap; And thence upon the fair moon's silver map, As if in question of this magic chance, Laid like a dream upon the green earth's lap; And then upon old Saturn turns askance, Exclaiming, with a glad and kindly glance:— “Oh, these be Fancy's revellers by night! Stealthy companions of the downy moth— Diana's motes, that flit in her pale light, Shunners of sunbeams in diurnal sloth;— These be the feasters on night's silver cloth;— The gnat with shrilly trump is their convener, Forth from their flowery chambers, nothing loth, With lulling tunes to charm the air serener, Or dance upon the grass to make it greener. “These be the pretty genii of the flow'rs, Daintily fed with honey and pure dew— Midsummer's phantoms in her dreaming hours, King Oberon, and all his merry crew, The darling puppets of Romance's view; Fairies, and sprites, and goblin elves we call them, Famous for patronage of lovers true;— No harm they act, neither shall harm befall them, So do not thus with crabbed frowns appal them.” O what a cry was Saturn's then!—it made The fairies quake. “What care I for their pranks, However they may lovers choose to aid, Or dance their roundelays on flow'ry banks?— Long must they dance before they earn my thanks,— So step aside, to some far safer spot, Whilst with my hungry scythe I mow their ranks, And leave them in the sun, like weeds, to rot, And with the next day's sun to be forgot.” Anon, he raised afresh his weapon keen; But still the gracious Shade disarm'd his aim, Stepping with brave alacrity between, And made his sere arm powerless and tame. His be perpetual glory, for the shame Of hoary Saturn in that grand defeat!— But I must tell how here Titania came With all her kneeling lieges, to entreat His kindly succour, in sad tones, but sweet. Saying, “Thou seest a wretched queen before thee, The fading power of a failing land, Who for a kingdom kneeleth to implore thee, Now menaced by this tyrant's spoiling hand; No one but thee can hopefully withstand That crooked blade, he longeth so to lift. I pray thee blind him with his own vile sand, Which only times all ruins by its drift, Or prune his eagle wings that are so swift. “Or take him by that sole and grizzled tuft, That hangs upon his bald and barren crown; And we will sing to see him so rebuff'd, And lend our little mights to pull him down, And make brave sport of his malicious frown, For all his boastful mockery o'er men. For thou wast born I know for this renown, By my most magical and inward ken, That readeth ev'n at Fate's forestalling pen. “Nay, by the golden lustre of thine eye, And by thy brow's most fair and ample span, Thought's glorious palace, framed for fancies high, And by thy cheek thus passionately wan, I know the signs of an immortal man,— Nature's chief darling, and illustrious mate, Destined to foil old Death's oblivious plan, And shine untarnish'd by the fogs of Fate, Time's famous rival till the final date! “O shield us then from this usurping Time, And we will visit thee in moonlight dreams; And teach thee tunes, to wed unto thy rhyme, And dance about thee in all midnight gleams, Giving thee glimpses of our magic schemes, Such as no mortal's eye hath ever seen; And, for thy love to us in our extremes, Will ever keep thy chaplet fresh and green, Such as no poet's wreath hath ever been! “And we'll distill thee aromatic dews, To charm thy sense, when there shall be no flow'rs; And flavour'd syrups in thy drinks infuse, And teach the nightingale to haunt thy bow'rs, And with our games divert thy weariest hours, With all that elfin wits can e'er devise. And, this churl dead, there'll be no hasting hours To rob thee of thy joys, as now joy flies:”— Here she was stopp'd by Saturn's furious cries. Whom, therefore, the kind Shade rebukes anew, Saying, “Thou haggard Sin, go forth, and scoop Thy hollow coffin in some churchyard yew, Or make th' autumnal flow'rs turn pale, and droop; Or fell the bearded corn, till gleaners stoop Under fat sheaves,—or blast the piny grove;— But here thou shalt not harm this pretty group, Whose lives are not so frail and feebly wove, But leased on Nature's loveliness and love. “'Tis these that free the small entangled fly, Caught in the venom'd spider's crafty snare;— These be the petty surgeons that apply The healing balsams to the wounded hare, Bedded in bloody fern, no creature's care!— These be providers for the orphan brood, Whose tender mother hath been slain in air, Quitting with gaping bill her darlings' food, Hard by the verge of her domestic wood. “'Tis these befriend the timid trembling stag, When, with a bursting heart beset with fears, He feels his saving speed begin to flag; For then they quench the fatal taint with tears, And prompt fresh shifts in his alarum'd ears, So piteously they view all bloody morts; Or if the gunner, with his arm, appears, Like noisy pyes and jays, with harsh reports, They warn the wild fowl of his deadly sports. “For these are kindly ministers of nature, To soothe all covert hurts and dumb distress; Pretty they be, and very small of stature,— For mercy still consorts with littleness;— Wherefore the sum of good is still the less, And mischief grossest in this world of wrong;— So do these charitable dwarfs redress The tenfold ravages of giants strong, To whom great malice and great might belong. “Likewise to them are Poets much beholden For secret favours in the midnight glooms; Brave Spenser quaff'd out of their goblets golden, And saw their tables spread of prompt mushrooms, And heard their horns of honeysuckle blooms Sounding upon the air most soothing soft, Like humming bees busy about the brooms,— And glanced this fair queen's witchery full oft, And in her magic wain soar'd far aloft. “Nay I myself, though mortal, once was nursed By fairy gossips, friendly at my birth, And in my childish ear glib Mab rehearsed Her breezy travels round our planet's girth, Telling me wonders of the moon and earth; My gramarye at her grave lap I conn'd, Where Puck hath been convened to make me mirth; I have had from Queen Titania tokens fond, And toy'd with Oberon's permitted wand. “With figs and plums and Persian dates they fed me, And delicate cates after my sunset meal, And took me by my childish hand, and led me By craggy rocks crested with keeps of steel, Whose awful bases deep dark woods conceal, Staining some dead lake with their verdant dyes: And when the West sparkled at Phœbus' wheel, With fairy euphrasy they purged mine eyes, To let me see their cities in the skies. “'Twas they first school'd my young imagination To take its flights like any new-fledged bird, And show'd the span of winged meditation Stretch'd wider than things grossly seen or heard. With sweet swift Ariel how I soar'd and stirr'd The fragrant blooms of spiritual bow'rs! 'Twas they endear'd what I have still preferr'd, Nature's blest attributes and balmy pow'rs, Her hills and vales and brooks, sweet birds and flow'rs! “Wherefore with all true loyalty and duty Will I regard them in my honouring rhyme, With love for love, and homages to beauty, And magic thoughts gather'd in night's cool clime, With studious verse trancing the dragon Time, Strong as old Merlin's necromantic spells; So these dear monarchs of the summer's prime Shall live unstartled by his dreadful yells, Till shrill larks warn them to their flowery cells.” Look how a poison'd man turns livid black, Drugg'd with a cup of deadly hellebore, That sets his horrid features all at rack,— So seem'd these words into the ear to pour Of ghastly Saturn, answering with a roar Of mortal pain and spite and utmost rage, Wherewith his grisly arm he raised once more, And bade the cluster'd sinews all engage, As if at one fell stroke to wreck an age. Whereas the blade flash'd on the dinted ground, Down through his steadfast foe, yet made no scar On that immortal Shade, or death-like wound; But Time was long benumb'd, and stood a-jar, And then with baffled rage took flight afar, To weep his hurt in some Cimmerian gloom, Or meaner fames (like mine) to mock and mar, Or sharp his scythe for royal strokes of doom, Whetting its edge on some old Cæsar's tomb. Howbeit he vanish'd in the forest shade, Distantly heard as if some grumbling pard, And, like Nymph Echo, to a sound decay'd;— Meanwhile the fays cluster'd the gracious Bard, The darling centre of their dear regard: Besides of sundry dances on the green, Never was mortal man so brightly starr'd, Or won such pretty homages, I ween. “Nod to him, Elves!” cries the melodious queen. “Nod to him, Elves, and flutter round about him, And quite enclose him with your pretty crowd, And touch him lovingly, for that, without him, The silk-worm now had spun our dreary shroud;— But he hath all dispersed Death's tearful cloud, And Time's dread effigy scared quite away: Bow to him then, as though to me ye bow'd, And his dear wishes prosper and obey Wherever love and wit can find a way! “'Noint him with fairy dews of magic savours, Shaken from orient buds still pearly wet, Roses and spicy pinks,—and, of all favours, Plant in his walks the purple violet, And meadow-sweet under the hedges set, To mingle breaths with dainty eglantine And honeysuckles sweet,—nor yet forget Some pastoral flowery chaplets to entwine, To vie the thoughts about his brow benign! “Let no wild things astonish him or fear him, But tell them all how mild he is of heart, Till e'en the timid hares go frankly near him, And eke the dappled does, yet never start; Nor shall their fawns into the thickets dart, Nor wrens forsake their nests among the leaves, Nor speckled thrushes flutter far apart;— But bid the sacred swallow haunt his eaves, To guard his roof from lighting and from thieves. “Or when he goes the nimble squirrel's visitor, Let the brown hermit bring his hoarded nuts, For, tell him, this is Nature's kind Inquisitor,— Though man keeps cautious doors that conscience shuts, For conscious wrong all curious quest rebuts,— Nor yet shall bees uncase their jealous stings, However he may watch their straw-built huts;— So let him learn the crafts of all small things, Which he will hint most aptly when he sings.” Here she leaves off, and with a graceful hand Waves thrice three splendid circles round his head; Which, though deserted by the radiant wand, Wears still the glory which her waving shed, Such as erst crown'd the old Apostle's head, To show the thoughts, there harbour'd, were divine, And on immortal contemplations fed:— Goodly it was to see that glory shine Around a brow so lofty and benign!— Goodly it was to see the elfin brood Contend for kisses of his gentle hand, That had their mortal enemy withstood, And stay'd their lives, fast ebbing with the sand. Long while this strife engaged the pretty band; But now bold Chanticleer, from farm to farm, Challenged the dawn creeping o'er eastern land, And well the fairies knew that shrill alarm, Which sounds the knell of every elfish charm. And soon the rolling mist, that 'gan arise From plashy mead and undiscover'd stream, Earth's morning incense to the early skies, Crept o'er the failing landscape of my dream. Soon faded then the Phantom of my theme— A shapeless shade, that fancy disavow'd, And shrank to nothing in the mist extreme. Then flew Titania,—and her little crowd, Like flocking linnets, vanish'd in a cloud. HERO AND LEANDER. TO S. T. COLERIDGE. It is not with a hope my feeble praise Can add one moment's honour to thy own, That with thy mighty name I grace these lays; I seek to glorify myself alone: For that some precious favour thou hast shown To my endeavour in a by-gone time, And by this token I would have it known Thou art my friend, and friendly to my rhyme! It is my dear ambition now to climb Still higher in thy thought,—if my bold pen May thrust on contemplations more sublime.— But I am thirsty for thy praise, for when We gain applauses from the great in name, We seem to be partakers of their fame. Oh Bards of old! what sorrows have ye sung, And tragic stories, chronicled in stone,— Sad Philomel restored her ravish'd tongue, And transform'd Niobe in dumbness shown; Sweet Sappho on her love for ever calls, And Hero on the drown'd Leander falls! Was it that spectacles of sadder plights Should make our blisses relish the more high? Then all fair dames, and maidens, and true knights, Whose flourish'd fortunes prosper in Love's eye, Weep here, unto a tale of ancient grief, Traced from the course of an old bas-relief. There stands Abydos!—here is Sestos' steep, Hard by the gusty margin of the sea, Where sprinkling waves continually do leap; And that is where those famous lovers be, A builded gloom shot up into the grey, As if the first tall watch-tow'r of the day. Lo! how the lark soars upward and is gone; Turning a spirit as he nears the sky, His voice is heard, though body there is none, And rain-like music scatters from on high; But Love would follow with a falcon spite, To pluck the minstrel from his dewy height. For Love hath framed a ditty of regrets, Tuned to the hollow sobbings on the shore, A vexing sense, that with like music frets, And chimes this dismal burthen o'er and o'er, Saying, Leander's joys are past and spent, Like stars extinguish'd in the firmament. For ere the golden crevices of morn Let in those regal luxuries of light, Which all the variable east adorn, And hang rich fringes on the skirts of night, Leander, weaning from sweet Hero's side, Must leave a widow where he found a bride. Hark! how the billows beat upon the sand! Like pawing steeds impatient of delay; Meanwhile their rider, ling'ring on the land, Dallies with love, and holds farewell at bay A too short span.—How tedious slow is grief! But parting renders time both sad and brief. “Alas!” he sigh'd, “that this first glimpsing light, Which makes the wide world tenderly appear, Should be the burning signal for my flight, From all the world's best image, which is here; Whose very shadow, in my fond compare, Shines far more bright than Beauty's self elsewhere.” Their cheeks are white as blossoms of the dark, Whose leaves close up and show the outward pale, And those fair mirrors where their joys did spark, All dim and tarnish'd with a dreary veil, No more to kindle till the night's return, Like stars replenish'd at Joy's golden urn. Ev'n thus they creep into the spectral grey, That cramps the landscape in its narrow brim, As when two shadows by old Lethe stray, He clasping her, and she entwining him; Like trees, wind-parted, that embrace anon,— True love so often goes before 'tis gone. For what rich merchant but will pause in fear, To trust his wealth to the unsafe abyss? So Hero dotes upon her treasure here, And sums the loss with many an anxious kiss, Whilst her fond eyes grow dizzy in her head, Fear aggravating fear with shows of dread. She thinks how many have been sunk and drown'd, And spies their snow-white bones below the deep, Then calls huge congregated monsters round, And plants a rock wherever he would leap; Anon she dwells on a fantastic dream, Which she interprets of that fatal stream. Saying, “That honied fly I saw was thee, Which lighted on a water-lily's cup, When, lo! the flower, enamour'd of my bee, Closed on him suddenly and lock'd him up, And he was smother'd in her drenching dew, Therefore this day thy drowning I shall rue.” But next, remembering her virgin fame, She clips him in her arms and bids him go, But seeing him break loose, repents her shame, And plucks him back upon her bosom's snow; And tears unfix her iced resolve again, As steadfast frosts are thaw'd by show'rs of rain. O for a type of parting!—Love to love Is like the fond attraction of two spheres, Which needs a godlike effort to remove, And then sink down their sunny atmospheres, In rain and darkness on each ruin'd heart, Nor yet their melodies will sound apart. So brave Leander sunders from his bride; The wrenching pang disparts his soul in twain; Half stays with her, half goes towards the tide,— And life must ache, until they join again. Now wouldst thou know the wideness of the wound?— Mete every step he takes upon the ground. And for the agony and bosom-throe, Let it be measured by the wide vast air, For that is infinite, and so is woe, Since parted lovers breathe it everywhere. Look how it heaves Leander's labouring chest, Panting, at poise, upon a rocky crest! From which he leaps into the scooping brine, That shocks his bosom with a double chill; Because, all hours, till the slow sun's decline, That cold divorcer will be twixt them still; Wherefore he likens it to Styx' foul tide, Where life grows death upon the other side. Then sadly he confronts his two-fold toil Against rude waves and an unwilling mind, Wishing, alas! with the stout rower's toil, That like a rower he might gaze behind, And watch that lonely statue he hath left, On her bleak summit, weeping and bereft! Yet turning oft, he sees her troubled locks Pursue him still the furthest that they may; Her marble arms that overstretch the rocks, And her pale passion'd hands that seem to pray In dumb petition to the gods above: Love prays devoutly when it prays for love! Then with deep sighs he blows away the wave, That hangs superfluous tears upon his cheek, And bans his labour like a hopeless slave, That, chain'd in hostile galley, faint and weak, Plies on despairing through the restless foam, Thoughtful of his lost love, and far-off home. The drowsy mist before him chill and dank, Like a dull lethargy o'erleans the sea, When he rows on against the utter blank, Steering as if to dim eternity,— Like Love's frail ghost departing with the dawn; A failing shadow in the twilight drawn. And soon is gone,—or nothing but a faint And failing image in the eye of thought, That mocks his model with an after-paint, And stains an atom like the shape she sought; Then with her earnest vows she hopes to fee The old and hoary majesty of sea. “O King of waves, and brother of high Jove, Preserve my sumless venture there afloat; A woman's heart, and its whole wealth of love, Are all embark'd upon that little boat; Nay!—but two loves, two lives, a double fate,— A perilous voyage for so dear a freight. “If impious mariners be stain'd with crime, Shake not in awful rage thy hoary locks; Lay by thy storms until another time, Lest my frail bark be dash'd against the rocks: O rather smooth thy deeps, that he may fly Like Love himself, upon a seeming sky! “Let all thy herded monsters sleep beneath, Nor gore him with crook'd tusks, or wreathëd horns; Let no fierce sharks destroy him with their teeth, Nor spine-fish wound him with their venom'd thorns; But if he faint, and timely succour lack, Let ruthful dolphins rest him on their back. “Let no false dimpling whirlpools suck him in, Nor slimy quicksands smother his sweet breath; Let no jagg'd coral tear his tender skin, Nor mountain billows bury him in death;”— And with that thought forestalling her own fears, She drowned his painted image in her tears. By this, the climbing Sun, with rest repair'd, Look'd through the gold embrasures of the sky. And ask'd the drowsy world how she had fared;— The drowsy world shone brighten'd in reply; And smiling off her fogs, his slanting beam Spied young Leander in the middle stream. His face was pallid, but the hectic morn Had hung a lying crimson on his cheeks, And slanderous sparkles in his eyes forlorn; So death lies ambush'd in consumptive streaks; But inward grief was writhing o'er its task, As heart-sick jesters weep behind the mask. He thought of Hero and the lost delight, Her last embracings, and the space between; He thought of Hero and the future night, Her speechless rapture and enamour'd mien, When, lo! before him, scarce two galleys' space, His thoughs confronted with another face! Her aspect's like a moon, divinely fair, But makes the midnight darker that it lies on; 'Tis so beclouded with her coal-black hair That densely skirts her luminous horizon, Making her doubly fair, thus darkly set, As marble lies advantaged upon jet. She's all too bright, too argent, and too pale, To be a woman;—but a woman's double, Reflected on the wave so faint and frail, She tops the billows like an air-blown bubble; Or dim creation of a morning dream, Fair as the wave-bleach'd lily of the stream. The very rumour strikes his seeing dead: Great beauty like great fear first stuns the sense: He knows not if her lips be blue or red, Nor of her eyes can give true evidence: Like murder's witness swooning in the court, His sight falls senseless by its own report. Anon resuming, it declares her eyes Are tint with azure, like two crystal wells That drink the blue complexion of the skies, Or pearls outpeeping from their silvery shells: Her polish'd brow, it is an ample plain, To lodge vast contemplations of the main. Her lips might corals seem, but corals near, Stray through her hair like blossoms on a bower; And o'er the weaker red still domineer, And make it pale by tribute to more power; Her rounded cheeks are of still paler hue, Touch'd by the bloom of water, tender blue. Thus he beholds her rocking on the water, Under the glossy umbrage of her hair, Like pearly Amphitrite's fairest daughter, Naiad, or Nereid, or Syren fair, Mislodging music in her pitiless breast, A nightingale within a falcon's nest. They say there be such maidens in the deep, Charming poor mariners, that all too near By mortals lullabies fall dead asleep, As drowsy men are poison'd through the ear; Therefore Leander's fears begin to urge, This snowy swan is come to sing his dirge. At which he falls into a deadly chill, And strains his eyes upon her lips apart; Fearing each breath to feel that prelude shrill, Pierce through his marrow, like a breath-blown dart Shot sudden from an Indian's hollow cane, With mortal venom fraught, and fiery pain. Here then, poor wretch, how he begins to crowd A thousand thoughts within a pulse's space; There seem'd so brief a pause of life allow'd, His mind stretch'd universal, to embrace The whole wide world, in an extreme farewell,— A moment's musing—but an age to tell. For there stood Hero, widow'd at a glance, The foreseen sum of many a tedious fact, Pale cheeks, dim eyes, and wither'd countenance, A wasted ruin that no wasting lack'd; Time's tragic consequents ere time began, A world of sorrow in a tear-drop's span. A moment's thinking is an hour in words,— An hour of words is little for some woes; Too little breathing a long life affords For love to paint itself by perfect shows; Then let his love and grief unwrong'd lie dumb, Whilst Fear, and that it fears, together come. As when the crew, hard by some jutty cape, Struck pale and panick'd by the billows' roar, Lay by all timely measures of escape, And let their bark go driving on the shore; So fray'd Leander, drifting to his wreck, Gazing on Scylla, falls upon her neck. For he hath all forgot the swimmer's art, The rower's cunning, and the pilot's skill, Letting his arms fall down in languid part, Sway'd by the waves, and nothing by his will, Till soon he jars against that glossy skin, Solid like glass, though seemingly as thin. Lo! how she startles at the warning shock, And straightway girds him to her radiant breast, More like his safe smooth harbour than his rock; Poor wretch, he is so faint and toil-opprest, He cannot loose him from his grappling foe, Whether for love or hate, she lets not go. His eyes are blinded with the sleety brine, His ears are deafen'd with the wildering noise; He asks the purpose of her fell design, But foamy waves choke up his struggling voice; Under the ponderous sea his body dips, And Hero's name dies bubbling on his lips. Look how a man is lower'd to his grave,— A yearning hollow in the green earth's lap; So he is sunk into the yawning wave,— The plunging sea fills up the watery gap; Anon he is all gone, and nothing seen But likeness of green turf and hillocks green. And where he swam, the constant sun lies sleeping, Over the verdant plain that makes his bed; And all the noisy waves go freshly leaping, Like gamesome boys over the churchyard dead; The light in vain keeps looking for his face:— Now screaming sea-fowl settle in his place. Yet weep and watch for him, though all in vain! Ye moaning billows, seek him as ye wander! Ye gazing sunbeams, look for him again! Ye winds, grow hoarse with asking for Leander! Ye did but spare him for more cruel rape, Sea-storm and ruin in a female shape! She says 'tis love hath bribed her to this deed, The glancing of his eyes did so bewitch her. O bootless theft! unprofitable meed! Love's treasury is sack'd, but she no richer; The sparkles of his eyes are cold and dead, And all his golden looks are turn'd to lead! She holds the casket, but her simple hand Hath spill'd its dearest jewel by the way; She hath life's empty garment at command, But her own death lies covert in the prey; As if a thief should steal a tainted vest, Some dead man's spoil, and sicken of his pest. Now she compels him to her deeps below, Hiding his face beneath her plenteous hair, Which jealously she shakes all round her brow, For dread of envy, though no eyes are there But seals', and all brute tenants' of the deep, Which heedless through the wave their journeys keep. Down and still downward through the dusky green She bore him, murmuring with joyous haste In too rash ignorance, as he had been Born to the texture of that watery waste; That which she breathed and sigh'd, the emerald wave! How could her pleasant home become his grave? Down and still downward through the dusky green She bore her treasure, with a face too nigh To mark how life was alter'd in its mien, Or how the light grew torpid in his eye, Or how his pearly breath, unprison'd there, Flew up to join the universal air. She could not miss the throbbings of his heart, Whilst her own pulse so wanton'd in its joy; She could not guess he struggled to depart, And when he strove no more, the hapless boy! She read his mortal stillness for content, Feeling no fear where only love was meant. Soon she alights upon her ocean-floor, And straight unyokes her arms from her fair prize; Then on his lovely face begins to pore, As if to glut her soul;—her hungry eyes Have grown so jealous of her arms' delight; It seems she hath no other sense but sight. But O sad marvel! O most bitter strange! What dismal magic makes his cheek so pale? Why will he not embrace,—why not exchange Her kindly kisses;—wherefore not exhale Some odorous message from life's ruby gates, Where she his first sweet embassy awaits? Her eyes, poor watchers, fix'd upon his looks, Are grappled with a wonder near to grief, As one, who pores on undecipher'd books, Strains vain surmise, and dodges with belief; So she keeps gazing with a mazy thought, Framing a thousand doubts that end in nought. Too stern inscription for a page so young, The dark translation of his look was death! But death was written in an alien tongue, And learning was not by to give it breath; So one deep woe sleeps buried in its seal, Which Time, untimely, hasteth to reveal. Meanwhile she sits unconscious of her hap, Nursing Death's marble effigy, which there With heavy head lies pillow'd in her lap, And elbows all unhinged;—his sleeking hair Creeps o'er her knees, and settles where his hand Leans with lax fingers crook'd against the sand; And there lies spread in many an oozy trail, Like glossy weeds hung from a chalky base, That shows no whiter than his brow is pale; So soon the wintry death had bleach'd his face Into cold marble,—with blue chilly shades, Showing wherein the freezy blood pervades. And o'er his steadfast cheek a furrow'd pain Hath set, and stiffen'd, like a storm in ice, Showing by drooping lines the deadly strain Of mortal anguish;—yet you might gaze twice Ere Death it seem'd, and not his cousin, Sleep, That through those creviced lids did underpeep. But all that tender bloom about his eyes, Is Death's own violets, which his utmost rite It is to scatter when the red rose dies; For blue is chilly, and akin to white: Also he leaves some tinges on his lips, Which he hath kiss'd with such cold frosty nips. “Surely,” quoth she, “he sleeps, the senseless thing, Oppress'd and faint with toiling in the stream!” Therefore she will not mar his rest, but sing So low, her tune shall mingle with his dream; Meanwhile, her lily fingers tasks to twine His uncrispt locks uncurling in the brine. “O lovely boy!”—thus she attuned her voice,— “Welcome, thrice welcome, to a sea-maid's home, My love-mate thou shalt be, and true heart's choice; How have I long'd such a twin-self should come,— A lonely thing, till this sweet chance befel, My heart kept sighing like a hollow shell. “Here thou shalt live, beneath this secret dome, An ocean-bow'r; defended by the shade Of quiet waters, a cool emerald gloom To lap thee all about. Nay, be not fray'd, Those are but shady fishes that sail by Like antic clouds across my liquid sky! “Look how the sunbeam burns upon their scales, And shows rich glimpses of their Tyrian skins; They flash small lightnings from their vigorous tails, And winking stars are kindled at their fins; These shall divert thee in thy weariest mood, And seek thy hand for gamesomeness and food. “Lo! those green pretty leaves with tassel bells, My flow'rets those, that never pine for drowth; Myself did plant them in the dappled shells, That drink the wave with such a rosy mouth,— Pearls wouldst thou have beside? crystals to shine? I had such treasures once,—now they are thine. “Now, lay thine ear against this golden sand, And thou shalt hear the music of the sea, Those hollow tunes it plays against the land,— Is't not a rich and wondrous melody? I have lain hours, and fancied in its tone I heard the languages of ages gone! “I too can sing when it shall please thy choice, And breathe soft tunes through a melodious shell, Though heretofore I have but set my voice To some long sighs, grief-harmonized, to tell How desolate I fared;—but this sweet change Will add new notes of gladness to my range! “Or bid me speak, and I will tell thee tales, Which I have framed out of the noise of waves; Ere now I have communed with senseless gales, And held vain colloquies with barren caves; But I could talk to thee whole days and days, Only to word my love a thousand ways. “But if thy lips will bless me with their speech, Then ope, sweet oracles! and I'll be mute; I was born ignorant for thee to teach, Nay all love's lore to thy dear looks impute; Then ope thine eyes, fair teachers, by whose light I saw to give away my heart aright!” But cold and deaf the sullen creature lies Over her knees, and with concealing clay, Like hoarding Avarice, locks up his eyes, And leaves her world impoverish'd of day; Then at his cruel lips she bends to plead, But there the door is closed against her need. Surely he sleeps,—so her false wits infer! Alas! poor sluggard, ne'er to wake again! Surely he sleeps, yet without any stir That might denote a vision in his brain; Or if he does not sleep, he feigns too long, Twice she hath reach'd the ending of her song. Therefore 'tis time she tells him to uncover Those radiant jesters, and disperse her fears, Whereby her April face is shaded over, Like rainy clouds just ripe for showering tears; Nay, if he will not wake, so poor she gets, Herself must rob those lock'd-up cabinets. With that she stoops above his brow, and bids Her busy hands forsake his tangled hair, And tenderly lift up those coffer-lids, That she may gaze upon the jewels there, Like babes that pluck an early bud apart, To know the dainty colour of its heart. Now, picture one, soft creeping to a bed, Who slowly parts the fringe-hung canopies, And then starts back to find the sleeper dead; So she looks in on his uncover'd eyes, And seeing all within so drear and dark, Her own bright soul dies in her like a spark. Backward she falls, like a pale prophetess, Under the swoon of holy divination: And what had all surpass'd her simple guess, She now resolves in this dark revelation; Death's very mystery,—oblivious death;— Long sleep,—deep night, and an entrancëd breath. Yet life, though wounded sore, not wholly slain, Merely obscured, and not extinguish'd, lies; Her breath that stood at ebb, soon flows again, Heaving her hollow breast with heavy sighs, And light comes in and kindles up the gloom, To light her spirit from its transient tomb. Then like the sun, awaken'd at new dawn, With pale bewilder'd face she peers about, And spies blurr'd images obscurely drawn, Uncertain shadows in a haze of doubt; But her true grief grows shapely by degrees,— A perish'd creature lying on her knees. And now she knows how that old Murther preys, Whose quarry on her lap lies newly slain: How he roams all abroad and grimly slays, Like a lean tiger in Love's own domain; Parting fond mates,—and oft in flowery lawns Bereaves mild mothers of their milky fawns. O too dear knowledge! O pernicious earning! Foul curse engraven upon beauty's page! Ev'n now the sorrow of that deadly learning Ploughs up her brow, like an untimely age And on her cheek stamps verdict of death's truth By canker blights upon the bud of youth! For as unwholesome winds decay the leaf, So her cheeks' rose is perish'd by her sighs, And withers in the sickly breath of grief; Whilst unacquainted rheum bedims her eyes, Tears, virgin tears, the first that ever leapt From those young lids, now plentifully wept. Whence being shed, the liquid crystalline Drops straightway down, refusing to partake In gross admixture with the baser brine, But shrinks and hardens into pearls opaque, Hereafter to be worn on arms and ears; So one maid's trophy is another's tears! “O foul Arch-Shadow, thou old cloud of Night,” (Thus in her frenzy she began to wail,) “Thou blank Oblivion—Blotter-out of light, Life's ruthless murderer, and dear love's bale! Why hast thou left thy havoc incomplete, Leaving me here, and slaying the more sweet? “Lo! what a lovely ruin thou hast made! Alas! alas! thou hast no eye to see, And blindly slew'st him in misguided shade. Would I had lent my doting sense to thee! But now I turn to thee, a willing mark, Thine arrows miss me in the aimless dark! “O doubly cruel!—twice misdoing spite But I will guide thee with my helping eyes, Or—walk the wide world through, devoid of sight,— Yet thou shalt know me by my many sighs. Nay, then thou should'st have spared my rose, false Death, And known Love's flow'r by smelling his sweet breath; “Or, when thy furious rage was round him dealing, Love should have grown from touching of his skin; But like cold marble thou art all unfeeling, And hast no ruddy springs of warmth within, And being but a shape of freezing bone, Thy touching only turn'd my love to stone! “And here, alas! he lies across my knees, With cheeks still colder than the stilly wave. The light beneath his eyelids seems to freeze; Here then, since Love is dead and lacks a grave, O come and dig it in my sad heart's core— That wound will bring a balsam for its sore! “For art thou not a sleep where sense of ill Lies stingless, like a sense benumb'd with cold, Healing all hurts only with sleep's good-will? So shall I slumber, and perchance behold My living love in dreams,—O happy night, That lets me company his banish'd spright! “O poppy Death!—sweet poisoner of sleep; Where shall I seek for thee, oblivious drug, That I may steep thee in my drink, and creep Out of life's coil? Look, Idol! how I hug Thy dainty image in this strict embrace, And kiss this clay-cold model of thy face! “Put out, put out these sun-consuming lamps, I do but read my sorrows by their shine; O come and quench them with thy oozy damps, And let my darkness intermix with thine; Since love is blinded, wherefore should I see? Now love is death,—death will be love to me! “Away, away, this vain complaining breath, It does but stir the troubles that I weep; Let it be hush'd and quieted, sweet Death; The wind must settle ere the wave can sleep,— Since love is silent, I would fain be mute; O Death, be gracious to my dying suit!” Thus far she pleads, but pleading nought avails her, For Death, her sullen burthen, deigns no heed; Then with dumb craving arms, since darkness fails her, She prays to heaven's fair light, as if her need Inspired her there were Gods to pity pain, Or end it,—but she lifts her arms in vain! Poor gilded Grief! the subtle light by this With mazy gold creeps through her watery mine, And, diving downward through the green abyss, Lights up her palace with an amber shine; There, falling on her arms,—the crystal skin Reveals the ruby tide that fares within. Look how the fulsome beam would hang a glory On her dark hair, but the dark hairs repel it; Look how the perjured glow suborns a story On her pale lips, but lips refuse to tell it; Grief will not swerve from grief, however told On coral lips, or character'd in gold; Or else, thou maid! safe anchor'd on Love's neck, Listing the hapless doom of young Leander, Thou would'st not shed a tear for that old wreck, Sitting secure where no wild surges wander; Whereas the woe moves on with tragic pace, And shows its sad reflection in thy face. Thus having travell'd on, and track'd the tale, Like the due course of an old bas-relief, Where Tragedy pursues her progress pale, Brood here awhile upon that sea-maid's grief, And take a deeper imprint from the frieze Of that young Fate, with Death upon her knees. Then whilst the melancholy Muse withal Resumes her music in a sadder tone, Meanwhile the sunbeam strikes upon the wall, Conceive that lovely siren to live on, Ev'n as Hope whisper'd the Promethean light Would kindle up the dead Leander's spright. “Tis light,” she says, “that feeds the glittering stars, And those were stars set in his heavenly brow; But this salt cloud, this cold sea-vapour, mars Their radiant breathing, and obscures them now; Therefore I'll lay him in the clear blue air, And see how these dull orbs will kindle there.” Swiftly as dolphins glide, or swifter yet, With dead Leander in her fond arms' fold, She cleaves the meshes of that radiant net The sun hath twined above of liquid gold, Nor slacks till on the margin of the land She lays his body on the glowing sand. There, like a pearly waif, just past the reach Of foamy billows he lies cast. Just then, Some listless fishers, straying down the beach, Spy out this wonder. Thence the curious men, Low crouching, creep into a thicket brake, And watch her doings till their rude hearts ache. First she begins to chafe him till she faints, Then falls upon his mouth with kisses many, And sometimes pauses in her own complaints To list his breathing, but there is not any,— Then looks into his eyes where no light dwells; Light makes no pictures in such muddy wells. The hot sun parches his discover'd eyes, The hot sun beats on his discolour'd limbs, The sand is oozy whereupon he lies, Soiling his fairness;—then away she swims, Meaning to gather him a daintier bed, Plucking the cool fresh weeds, brown, green, and red. But, simple-witted thief, while she dives under, Another robs her of her amorous theft; The ambush'd fishermen creep forth to plunder, And steal the unwatch'd treasure she has left; Only his void impression dints the sands; Leander is purloin'd by stealthy hands! Lo! how she shudders off the beaded wave, Like Grief all over tears, and senseless falls,— His void imprint seems hollow'd for her grave; Then, rising on her knees, looks round and calls On “Hero! Hero!” having learn'd this name Of his last breath, she calls him by the same. Then with her frantic hands she rends her hairs, And casts them forth, sad keepsakes to the wind, As if in plucking those she pluck'd her cares; But grief lies deeper, and remains behind Like a barb'd arrow, rankling in her brain, Turning her very thoughts to throbs of pain. Anon her tangled locks are left alone, And down upon the sand she meekly sits, Hard by the foam, as humble as a stone, Like an enchanted maid beside her wits, That ponders with a look serene and tragic, Stunn'd by the mighty mystery of magic. Or think of Ariadne's utter trance, Crazed by the flight of that disloyal traitor, Who left her gazing on the green expanse That swallow'd up his track,—yet this would mate her, Ev'n in the cloudy summit of her woe, When o'er the far sea-brim she saw him go. For even so she bows, and bends her gaze O'er the eternal waste, as if to sum Its waves by weary thousands all her days, Dismally doom'd! meanwhile the billows come, And coldly dabble with her quiet feet, Like any bleaching stones they wont to greet. And thence into her lap have boldly sprung, Washing her weedy tresses to and fro, That round her crouching knees have darkly hung But she sits careless of waves' ebb and flow, Like a lone beacon on a desert coast, Showing where all her hope was wreck'd and lost. Yet whether in the sea or vaulted sky, She knoweth not her love's abrupt resort, So like a shape of dreams he left her eye, Winking with doubt. Meanwhile, the churls' report Has throng'd the beach with many a curious face, That peeps upon her from its hiding place. And here a head, and there a brow half seen, Dodges behind a rock. Here on his hands A mariner his crumpled cheeks doth lean Over a rugged crest. Another stands, Holding his harmful arrow at the head, Still check'd by human caution and strange dread. One stops his ears,—another close beholder Whispers unto the next his grave surmise; This crouches down,—and just above his shoulder, A woman's pity saddens in her eyes, And prompts her to befriend that lonely grief, With all sweet helps of sisterly relief. And down the sunny beach she paces slowly, With many doubtful pauses by the way; Grief hath an influence so hush'd and holy,— Making her twice attempt, ere she can lay Her hand upon that sea-maid's shoulder white, Which makes her startle up in wild affright. And, like a seal, she leaps into the wave That drowns the shrill remainder of her scream; Anon the sea fills up the watery cave, And seals her exit with a foamy seam,— Leaving those baffled gazers on the beach, Turning in uncouth wonder each to each. Some watch, some call, some see her head emerge, Wherever a brown weed falls through the foam; Some point to white eruptions of the surge:— But she is vanish'd to her shady home, Under the deep, inscrutable,—and there Weeps in a midnight made of her own hair. Now here, the sighing winds, before unheard, Forth from their cloudy caves begin to blow Till all the surface of the deep is stirr'd, Like to the panting grief it hides below; And heaven is cover'd with a stormy rack, Soiling the waters with its inky black. The screaming fowl resigns her finny prey, And labours shoreward with a bending wing, Rowing against the wind her toilsome way; Meanwhile, the curling billows chafe, and fling Their dewy frost still further on the stones, That answer to the wind with hollow groans. And here and there a fisher's far-off bark Flies with the sun's last glimpse upon its sail, Like a bright flame amid the waters dark, Watch'd with the hope and fear of maidens pale; And anxious mothers that upturn their brows, Freighting the gusty wind with frequent vows, For that the horrid deep has no sure path To guide Love safe into his homely haven. And lo! the storm grows blacker in its wrath, O'er the dark billow brooding like a raven, That bodes of death and widow's sorrowing, Under the dusky covert of his wing. And so day ended. But no vesper spark Hung forth its heavenly sign; but sheets of flame Play'd round the savage features of the dark, Making night horrible. That night, there came A weeping maiden to high Sestos' steep, And tore her hair and gazed upon the deep. And waved aloft her bright and ruddy torch, Whose flame the boastful wind so rudely fann'd, That oft it would recoil, and basely scorch The tender covert of her sheltering hand; Which yet, for Love's dear sake, disdain'd retire, And, like a glorying martyr, braved the fire. For that was Love's own sign and beacon guide Across the Hellespont's wide weary space, Wherein he nightly struggled with the tide:— Look what a red it forges on her face, As if she blush'd at holding such a light, Ev'n in the unseen presence of the night! Whereas her tragic cheek is truly pale, And colder than the rude and ruffian air That howls into her ear a horrid tale Of storm and wreck, and uttermost despair, Saying, “Leander floats amid the surge, And those are dismal waves that sing his dirge.” And hark!—a grieving voice, trembling and faint, Blends with the hollow sobbings of the sea; Like the sad music of a siren's plaint, But shriller than Leander's voice should be, Unless the wintry death had changed its tone,— Wherefore she thinks she hears his spirit moan. For now, upon each brief and breathless pause, Made by the raging winds, it plainly calls On “Hero! Hero!”—whereupon she draws Close to the dizzy brink, that ne'er appals Her brave and constant spirit to recoil, However the wild billows toss and toil. “Oh! dost thou live under the deep deep sea? I thought such love as thine could never die; If thou hast gain'd an immortality From the kind pitying sea-god, so will I; And this false cruel tide that used to sever Our hearts, shall be our common home for ever! “There we will sit and sport upon one billow, And sing our ocean ditties all the day, And lie together on the same green pillow, That curls above us with its dewy spray; And ever in one presence live and dwell, Like two twin pearls within the selfsame shell.” One moment then, upon the dizzy verge She stands;—with face upturn'd against the sky; A moment more, upon the foamy surge She gazes, with a calm despairing eye; Feeling that awful pause of blood and breath, Which life endures when it confronts with death;— Then from the giddy steep she madly springs, Grasping her maiden robes, that vainly kept Panting abroad, like unavailing wings, To save her from her death.—The sea-maid wept And in a crystal cave her corse enshrined; No meaner sepulchre should Hero find! BALLAD. [Spring it is cheery] Spring it is cheery, Winter is dreary, Green leaves hang, but the brown must fly; When he's forsaken, Wither'd and shaken, What can an old man do but die? Love will not clip him, Maids will not lip him, Maud and Marian pass him by; Youth it is sunny, Age has no honey,— What can an old man do but die? June it is jolly, Oh for its folly! A dancing leg and a laughing eye; Youth may be silly, Wisdom is chilly,— What can an old man do but die? SONG. FOR MUSIC. A lake and a fairy boat To sail in the moonlight clear,— And merrily we would float From the dragons that watch us here! Thy gown should be snow-white silk, And strings of orient pearls, Like gossamers dipt in milk, Should twine with thy raven curls! Red rubies should deck thy hands, And diamonds should be thy dower— But Fairies have broke their wands And wishing has lost its power. AUTUMN. The Autumn skies are flush'd with gold, And fair and bright the rivers run; These are but streams of winter cold, And painted mists that quench the sun. In secret boughs no sweet birds sing, In secret boughs no bird can shroud; These are but leaves that take to wing, And wintry winds that pipe so loud. 'Tis not trees' shade, but cloudy glooms That on the cheerless valleys fall, The flowers are in their grassy tombs, And tears of dew are on them all. BALLAD. [Sigh on, sad heart, for Love's eclipse] Sigh on, sad heart, for Love's eclipse And Beauty's fairest queen, Though 'tis not for my peasant lips To soil her name between: A king might lay his sceptre down, But I am poor and nought, The brow should wear a golden crown That wears her in its thought. The diamonds glancing in her hair, Whose sudden beams surprise, Might bid such humble hopes beware The glancing of her eyes; Yet looking once, I look'd too long, And if my love is sin, Death follows on the heels of wrong, And kills the crime within. Her dress seem'd wove of lily leaves, It was so pure and fine,— O lofty wears, and lowly weaves,— But hodden-grey is mine; And homely hose must step apart, Where garter'd princes stand, But may he wear my love at heart That wins her lily hand! Alas! there's far from russet frieze To silks and satin gowns, But I doubt if God made like degrees, In courtly hearts and clowns. My father wrong'd a maiden's mirth, And brought her cheeks to blame, And all that's lordly of my birth Is my reproach and shame! 'Tis vain to weep,—'tis vain to sigh, 'Tis vain, this idle speech, For where her happy pearls do lie, My tears may never reach; Yet when I'm gone, e'en lofty pride May say, of what has been, His love was nobly born and died, Though all the rest was mean! My speech is rude,—but speech is weak Such love as mine to tell, Yet had I words, I dare not speak, So, Lady, fare thee well; I will not wish thy better state Was one of low degree, But I must weep that partial fate Made such a churl of me. ODE TO THE MOON. Mother of light! how fairly dost thou go Over those hoary crests, divinely led!— Art thou that huntress of the silver bow, Fabled of old? Or rather dost thou tread Those cloudy summits thence to gaze below, Like the wild Chamois from her Alpine snow, Where hunter never climb'd,—secure from dread? How many antique fancies have I read Of that mild presence! and how many wrought! Wondrous and bright, Upon the silver light, Chasing fair figures with the artist, Thought! What art thou like?—Sometimes I see thee ride A far-bound galley on its perilous way, Whilst breezy waves toss up their silvery spray;— Sometimes behold thee glide, Cluster'd by all thy family of stars, Like a lone widow, through the welkin wide, Whose pallid cheek the midnight sorrow mars;— Sometimes I watch thee on from steep to steep, Timidly lighted by thy vestal torch, Till in some Latmian cave I see thee creep, To catch the young Endymion asleep,— Leaving thy splendour at the jagged porch!— Oh, thou art beautiful, howe'er it be! Huntress, or Dian, or whatever named; And he, the veriest Pagan, that first framed A silver idol, and ne'er worshipp'd thee!— It is too late—or thou should'st have my knee— Too late now for the old Ephesian vows, And not divine the crescent on thy brows!— Yet, call thee nothing but the mere mild Moon, Behind those chestnut boughs, Casting their dappled shadows at my feet; I will be grateful for that simple boon, In many a thoughtful verse and anthem sweet, And bless thy dainty face whene'er we meet. In nights far gone,—ay, far away and dead,— Before Care-fretted, with a lidless eye,— I was thy wooer on my little bed, Letting the early hours of rest go by, To see thee flood the heaven with milky light, And feed thy snow-white swans, before I slept; For thou wert then purveyor of my dreams,— Thou wert the fairies' armourer, that kept Their burnish'd helms, and crowns, and corslets bright, Their spears, and glittering mails; And ever thou didst spill in winding streams Sparkles and midnight gleams, For fishes to new gloss their argent scales!— Why sighs?—why creeping tears?—why claspëd hands?— Is it to count the boy's expended dow'r? That fairies since have broke their gifted wands? That young Delight, like any o'erblown flow'r, Gave, one by one, its sweet leaves to the ground?— Why then, fair Moon, for all thou mark'st no hour, Thou art a sadder dial to old Time Than ever I have found On sunny garden-plot, or moss-grown tow'r, Motto'd with stern and melancholy rhyme. Why should I grieve for this?—Oh I must yearn Whilst Time, conspirator with Memory, Keeps his cold ashes in an ancient urn, Richly emboss'd with childhood's revelry, With leaves and cluster'd fruits, and flow'rs eterne,— (Eternal to the world, though not to me), Aye there will those brave sports and blossoms be, The deathless wreath, and undecay'd festoon. When I am hearsed within,— Less than the pallid primrose to the Moon, That now she watches through a vapour thin. So let it be:—Before I lived to sigh, Thou wert in Avon, and a thousand rills, Beautiful Orb! and so, whene'er I lie Trodden, thou wilt be gazing from thy hills. Blest be thy loving light, where'er it spills, And blessëd thy fair face, O Mother mild! Still shine, the soul of rivers as they run, Still lend thy lonely lamp to lovers fond, And blend their plighted shadows into one:— Still smile at even on the bedded child, And close his eyelids with thy silver wand! THE EXILE. The swallow with summer Will wing o'er the seas, The wind that I sigh to Will visit thy trees. The ship that it hastens Thy ports will contain, But me!—I must never See England again! There's many that weep there, But one weeps alone, For the tears that are falling So far from her own; So far from thy own, love, We know not our pain; If death is between us, Or only the main. When the white cloud reclines On the verge of the sea, I fancy the white cliffs, And dream upon thee; But the cloud spreads its wings To the blue heav'n and flies. We never shall meet, love, Except in the skies! TO JANE. Welcome, dear Heart, and a most kind good-morrow; The day is gloomy, but our looks shall shine:— Flowers I have none to give thee, but I borrow Their sweetness in a verse to speak for thine. Here are red Roses, gather'd at thy cheeks, The white were all too happy to look white: For love the Rose, for faith the Lily speaks; It withers in false hands, but here 'tis bright! Dost love sweet Hyacinth! Its scented leaf Curls manifold,—all love's delights blow double: 'Tis said this flow'ret is inscribed with grief,— But let that hint of a forgotten trouble. I pluck'd the Primrose at night's dewy noon; Like Hope, it show'd its blossoms in the night;— 'Twas, like Endymion, watching for the Moon! And here are Sun-flowers, amorous of light! These golden Buttercups are April's seal,— The Daisy-stars her constellations be: These grew so lowly, I was forced to kneel, Therefore I pluck no Daisies but for thee! Here's Daisies for the morn, Primrose for gloom, Pansies and Roses for the noontide hours:— A wight once made a dial of their bloom,— So may thy life be measured out by flowers! ODE TO MELANCHOLY. Come, let us set our careful breasts, Like Philomel, against the thorn, To aggravate the inward grief, That makes her accents so forlorn; The world has many cruel points, Whereby our bosoms have been torn, And there are dainty themes of grief, In sadness to outlast the morn,— True honour's dearth, affection's death, Neglectful pride, and cankering scorn, With all the piteous tales that tears Have water'd since the world was born. The world!—it is a wilderness, Where tears are hung on every tree; For thus my gloomy phantasy Makes all things weep with me! Come let us sit and watch the sky, And fancy clouds, where no clouds be; Grief is enough to blot the eye, And make heaven black with misery. Why should birds sing such merry notes, Unless they were more blest than we? No sorrow ever chokes their throats, Except sweet nightingale; for she Was born to pain our hearts the more With her sad melody. Why shines the Sun, except that he Makes gloomy nooks for Grief to hide, And pensive shades for Melancholy, When all the earth is bright beside? Let clay wear smiles, and green grass wave, Mirth shall not win us back again, Whilst man is made of his own grave, And fairest clouds but gilded rain! I saw my mother in her shroud, Her cheek was cold and very pale; And ever since I've look'd on all As creatures doom'd to fail! Why do buds ope except to die? Ay, let us watch the roses wither, And think of our loves' cheeks; And oh! how quickly time doth fly To bring death's winter hither! Minutes, hours, days, and weeks, Months, years, and ages, shrink to nought; An age past is but a thought! Ay, let us think of him awhile That, with a coffin for a boat, Rows daily o'er the Stygian moat, And for our table choose a tomb: There's dark enough in any skull To charge with black a raven plume; And for the saddest funeral thoughts A winding-sheet hath ample room, Where Death, with his keen-pointed style, Hath writ the common doom. How wide the yew-tree spreads its gloom, And o'er the dead lets fall its dew, As if in tears it wept for them, The many human families That sleep around its stem! How cold the dead have made these stones, With natural drops kept ever wet! Lo! here the best—the worst—the world Doth now remember or forget, Are in one common ruin hurl'd, And love and hate are calmly met; The loveliest eyes that ever shone, The fairest hands, and locks of jet. Is't not enough to vex our souls, And fill our eyes, that we have set Our love upon a rose's leaf, Our hearts upon a violet? Blue eyes, red cheeks, are frailer yet; And sometimes at their swift decay Beforehand we must fret. The roses bud and bloom again; But Love may haunt the grave of Love, And watch the mould in vain. O clasp me, sweet, whilst thou art mine, And do not take my tears amiss; For tears must flow to wash away A thought that shows so stern as this: Forgive, if somewhile I forget, In woe to come, the present bliss; As frighted Proserpine let fall Her flowers at the sight of Dis: Ev'n so the dark and bright will kiss— The sunniest things throw sternest shade, And there is ev'n a happiness That makes the heart afraid! Now let us with a spell invoke The full-orb'd moon to grieve our eyes; Not bright, not bright, but, with a cloud Lapp'd all about her, let her rise All pale and dim, as if from rest The ghost of the late-buried sun Had crept into the skies. The Moon! she is the source of sighs, The very face to make us sad; If but to think in other times The same calm quiet look she had, As if the world held nothing base, Of vile and mean, of fierce and bad; The same fair light that shone in streams, The fairy lamp that charm'd the lad; For so it is, with spent delights She taunts men's brains, and makes them mad. All things are touch'd with Melancholy, Born of the secret soul's mistrust, To feel her fair ethereal wings Weigh'd down with vile degraded dust; Even the bright extremes of joy Bring on conclusions of disgust, Like the sweet blossoms of the May, Whose fragrance ends in must. O give her, then, her tribute just, Her sighs and tears, and musings holy; There is no music in the life That sounds with idiot laughter solely; There's not a string attuned to mirth, But has its chord in Melancholy. SONNET. ON MISTRESS NICELY, A PATTERN FOR HOUSEKEEPERS. WRITTEN AFTER SEEING MRS. DAVENPORT IN HER CHARACTER AT COVENT GARDEN. She was a woman peerless in her station, With household virtues wedded to her name; Spotless in linen, grass-bleached in her fame, And pure and clear-starched in her reputation;— Thence in my Castle of Imagination She dwells for evermore, the dainty dame, To keep all airy draperies from shame, And all dream-furniture in preservation; There walketh she with keys quite silver-bright, In perfect hose, and shoes of seemly black, Apron and stomacher of lily-white, And decent order follows in her track: The burnished plate grows lustrous in her sight, And polished floors and tables shine her back. SONNET. [By ev'ry sweet tradition of true hearts] By ev'ry sweet tradition of true hearts, Graven by Time, in love with his own lore; By all old martyrdoms and antique smarts, Wherein Love died to be alive the more; Yea, by the sad impression on the shore, Left by the drown'd Leander, to endear That coast for ever, where the billow's roar Moaneth for pity in the Poet's ear; By Hero's faith, and the foreboding tear That quench'd her brand's last twinkle in its fall; By Sappho's leap, and the low rustling fear That sigh'd around her flight; I swear by all, The world shall find such pattern in my act, As if Love's great examples still were lack'd. SONNET. TO MY WIFE. The curse of Adam, the old curse of all, Though I inherit in this feverish life Of worldly toil, vain wishes, and hard strife, And fruitless thought, in Care's eternal thrall, Yet more sweet honey than of bitter gall I taste, through thee, my Eva, my sweet wife. Then what was Man's lost Paradise!—how rife Of bliss, since love is with him in his fall! Such as our own pure passion still might frame, Of this fair earth, and its delightful bow'rs, If no fell sorrow, like the serpent, came To trail its venom o'er the sweetest flow'rs;— But oh! as many and such tears are ours, As only should be shed for guilt and shame! SONNET. ON RECEIVING A GIFT. Look how the golden ocean shines above Its pebbly stones, and magnifies their girth; So does the bright and blessed light of Love Its own things glorify, and raise their worth. As weeds seem flowers beneath the flattering brine, And stones like gems, and gems as gems indeed, Ev'n so our tokens shine; nay, they outshine Pebbles and pearls, and gems and coral weed; For where be ocean waves but half so clear, So calmly constant, and so kindly warm, As Love's most mild and glowing atmosphere, That hath no dregs to be upturn'd by storm? Thus, sweet, thy gracious gifts are gifts of price, And more than gold to doting Avarice. SONNET. [Love, dearest Lady, such as I would speak] Love, dearest Lady, such as I would speak, Lives not within the humour of the eye;— Not being but an outward phantasy, That skims the surface of a tinted cheek,— Else it would wane with beauty, and grow weak, As if the rose made summer,—and so lie Amongst the perishable things that die, Unlike the love which I would give and seek: Whose health is of no hue—to feel decay With cheeks' decay, that have a rosy prime. Love is its own great loveliness alway, And takes new lustre from the touch of time; Its bough owns no December and no May, But bears its blossom into Winter's clime. ODES AND ADDRESSES TO GREAT PEOPLE. TO THOMAS BISH, ESQ. “The oyster-woman locked her fish up, And trudged away to cry ‘no Bish—.’” —Hudibras. My Bish, since fickle Fortune's dead, Where throbs thy speculating head That hatch'd such matchless stories Of gaining, like Napoleon, all Success on every capital, And thirty thousand glories? Dost thou now sit when evening comes, Wrapt in its cold and wintry glooms, And dream o'er faded pleasures? See numbers rise and numbers fall, Hear Lottery's last funereal call O'er all her vanish'd treasures? Thy head, distract 'twixt weal and woe, Feels the last Lottery like a blow From malice—aimed at thee; No prizes pass in decent rank, Nothing is left thee but a blank, And worthy Mrs. B. Perchance at times thy wits may strive With cards to keep the game alive, And mock the old arena, By fighting Fortune at Ecarté, Thou Charing Cross's Bonaparté In little St. Helena. Thou'rt out of luck—for to thy share, Not as of old, falls blank despair; The thought oft gives the vapours. In some ‘cursed cottage of content’ Thy baffled hopeless hours are spent Spelling the daily papers. No more thy name in column stares On the lured reader unawares; The voice of Fame is o'er! No more it breathes thee into print; What is Fame's breath? There's nothing in't— The merest puff—no more! The puff to others now belongs, The Wrights have risen upon thy wrongs, Rowlands to Hunts recoil! The wheel of Fortune, now forlorn, Turns but to grind the roasted corn, Greased with Macassar oil. Election chances seemed a vent For thy desires—but Parliament Is not so easy won. Numbers were once to thee a treat, But now by numbers thou wert beat, And Rowland Stephenson. At Drury, too, the chance was thine; But thou shalt in past glory shine, Not as the uncertain actor; Not as the man that opens wide The floodgate for the public tide, But as the Great Contractor. And when—but Heaven protract the day— The time is come for Life's decay, Prolonged shall be thy joys. A favourite wheel shall carry thee, And like thy darling Lottery, Be drawn by Blue-coat boys. A tumulus shall cover thee And thine. A barrow it will be, Sacred to thy one wheel. And genuine tears, my Bish, from eyes Of those who never got a prize, At morn and eve shall steal. ODE. [Jerdan, farewell! farewell to all] “I'll give him dash for dash.” Jerdan, farewell! farewell to all Who ever prais'd me, great or small Your poet's course is run! A weekly—no, an every-day Reviewer takes my fame away, And I am all undone! I cannot live an author long! When I did write, O I did wrong To aim at being great; A Diamond Poet in a pin May twinkle on in peace, and win No diamond critic's hate! No small inditer of reviews Will analyse his tiny muse, Or lay his sonnets waste; Who strives to prove that Richardson, That calls himself a diamond one, Is but a bard of paste? The smallest bird that wings the sky May tempt some sparrow-shot, and die; But midges still go free! The peace that shuns my board and bed May settle on a lowlier head, And dwell, “St. John, with thee!” I aim'd at higher growth; and now My leaves are wither'd on the bough, I'm choked by bitter shrubs! O Mr. F. C. W.! What can I christen thy review But one of “Wormwood Scrubs?” The very man that sought me once— (Can I so soon be grown a dunce?) He now derides my verse; But who, save me, will fret to find The editor has changed his mind,— He can't have got a worse. 1828. TOWN AND COUNTRY. AN ODE. O! well may poets make a fuss In summer time, and sigh “O rus!” Of London pleasures sick: My heart is all at pant to rest In greenwood shades—my eyes detest This endless meal of brick! What joy have I in June's return? My feet are parch'd, my eyeballs burn, I scent no flowery gust: But faint the flagging zephyr springs, With dry Macadam on its wings, And turns me “dust to dust.” My sun his daily course renews Due east, but with no Eastern dews; The path is dry and hot! His setting shows more tamely still, He sinks behind no purple hill, But down a chimney's pot! O! but to hear the milkmaid blithe, Or early mower wet his scythe The dewy meads among!— My grass is of that sort, alas! That makes no hay—called sparrow-grass By folks of vulgar tongue! O! but to smell the woodbines sweet! I think of cowslip cups—but meet With very vile rebuffs! For meadow-buds I get a whiff Of Cheshire cheese,—or only sniff The turtle made at Cuff's. How tenderly Rousseau reviewed His periwinkles!—mine are stewed! My rose blooms on a gown!— I hunt in vain for eglantine, And find my blue-bell on the sign That marks the Bell and Crown: Where are ye, birds! that blithely wing From tree to tree, and gaily sing Or mourn in thickets deep? My cuckoo has some ware to sell, The watchman is my Philomel, My blackbird is a sweep! Where are ye, linnet, lark, and thrush! That perch on leafy bough and bush, And tune the various song? Two hurdygurdists, and a poor Street-Handel grinding at my door, Are all my “tuneful throng.” Where are ye, early-purling streams, Whose waves reflect the morning beams, And colours of the skies? My rills are only puddle-drains From shambles, or reflect the stains Of calimanco-dyes! Sweet are the little brooks that run O'er pebbles glancing in the sun, Singing in soothing tones:— Not thus the city streamlets flow; They make no music as they go, Though never “off the stones.” Where are ye, pastoral pretty sheep, That wont to bleat, and frisk, and leap Beside your woolly dams? Alas! instead of harmless crooks, My Corydons use iron hooks, And skin—not shear—the lambs. The pipe whereon, in olden day, The Arcadian herdsman used to play Sweetly, here soundeth not; But merely breathes unwholesome fumes, Meanwhile the city boor consumes The rank weed—“piping hot.” All rural things are vilely mocked, On every hand the sense is shocked, With objects hard to bear: Shades—vernal shades!—where wine is sold! And, for a turfy bank, behold An Ingram's rustic chair! Where are ye, London meads and bowers, And gardens redolent of flowers Wherein the zephyr wons? Alas! Moor Fields are fields no more. See Hatton's Garden bricked all o'er, And that bare wood—St. John's. No pastoral scenes procure me peace; I hold no Leasowes in my lease, No cot set round with trees: No sheep-white hill my dwelling flanks; And omnium furnishes my banks With brokers—not with bees. O! well may poets make a fuss In summer time, and sigh “O rus!” Of city pleasures sick: My heart is all at pant to rest In greenwood shades—my eyes detest That endless meal of brick. LAMENT FOR THE DECLINE OF CHIVALRY. Well hast thou cried, departed Burke, All chivalrous romantic work Is ended now and past!— That iron age—which some have thought Of metal rather overwrought— Is now all overcast! Ay! where are those heroic knights Of old—those armadillo wights Who wore the plated vest?— Great Charlemagne and all his peers Are cold—enjoying with their spears An everlasting rest! The bold King Arthur sleepeth sound So sleep his knights who gave that Round Old Table such éclat! O, Time has pluck'd the plumy brow! And none engage at tourneys now But those that go to law! Grim John o'Gaunt is quite gone by, And Guy is nothing but a Guy, Orlando lies forlorn!— Bold Sidney, and his kidney—nay, Those “early champions”—what are they But knights without a morn? No Percy branch now perseveres, Like those of old, in breaking spears— The name is now a lie!— Surgeons, alone, by any chance, Are all that ever couch a lance To couch a body's eye! Alas for Lion-Hearted Dick, That cut the Moslems to the quick, His weapon lies in peace: O, it would warm them in a trice, If they could only have a spice Of his old mace in Greece! The famed Rinaldo lies a-cold, And Tancred too, and Godfrey bold, That scaled the holy wall! No Saracen meets Paladin, We hear of no great Saladin, But only grow the small! Our Cressys, too, have dwindled since To penny things—at our Black Prince Historic pens would scoff: The only one we moderns had Was nothing but a Sandwich lad, And measles took him off! Where are those old and feudal clans, Their pikes, and bills, and partizans, Their hauberks, jerkins, buffs? A battle was a battle then, A breathing piece of work; but men Fight now—with powder puffs. The curtal-axe is out of date; The good old crossbow bends—to Fate; 'Tis gone, the archer's craft! No tough arm bends the springing yew, And jolly draymen ride, in lieu Of Death, upon the shaft! The spear, the gallant tilter's pride, The rusty spear, is laid aside,— O, spits now domineer! The coat of mail is left alone,— And where is all chain armour gone? Go ask a Brighton Pier. We fight in ropes, and not in lists, Bestowing hand-cuffs with our fists, A low and vulgar art! No mounted man is overthrown: A tilt! it is a thing unknown— Except upon a cart! Methinks I see the bounding barb, Clad like his chief in steely garb, For warding steel's appliance! Methinks I hear the trumpet stir 'Tis but the guard to Exeter, That bugles the “Defiance.” In cavils when will cavaliers Set ringing helmets by the ears, And scatter plumes about? Or blood—if they are in the vein? That tap will never run again— Alas! the Casque is out! No iron-crackling now is scored By dint of battle-axe or sword, To find a vital place— Though certain doctors still pretend, Awhile, before they kill a friend, To labour through his case! Farewell, then, ancient men of might! Crusader, errant squire, and knight! Our coats and custom soften; To rise would only make you weep— Sleep on, in rusty-iron sleep, As in a safety coffin! EX POST-FACTO EPIGRAMS. ON THE DEATH OF THE GIRAFFE. They say, God wot! She died upon the spot: But then in spots she was so rich,— I wonder which? ON THE REMOVAL OF A MENAGERIE. Let Exeter Change lament its change, Its beasts and other losses— Another place thrives by its case, Now Charing has two Crosses. THE LOGICIANS. AN ILLUSTRATION. “Metaphysics were a large field in which to exercise the weapons logic had put into their hands.” —Scriblerus. See here two cavillers, Would-be unravellers Of abstruse theory and questions mystical, In tête-à-tête, And deep debate, Wrangling according to forms syllogistical. Glowing and ruddy The light streams in upon their deep brown study, And settles on our bald logician's skull: But still his meditative eye looks dull And muddy, For he is gazing inwardly, like Plato; But to the world without And things about, His eye is blind as that of a potato: In fact, logicians See but by syllogisms—taste and smell By propositions; And never let the common dray-horse senses Draw inferences. How wise his brow! how eloquent his nose! The feature of itself is a negation! How gravely double is his chin, that shows Double deliberation; His scornful lip forestalls the confutation! O this is he that wisely with a major And minor proves a greengage is no gauger!— By help of ergo, That cheese of sage will make no mite the sager, And Taurus is no bull to toss up Virgo!— O this is he that logically tore his Dog into dogmas—following Aristotle— Cut up his cat into ten categories, And cork'd an abstract conjuror in a bottle. O this is he that disembodied matter, And proved that incorporeal corporations Put nothing in no platter, And for mock turtle only supp'd sensations! O this is he that palpably decided, With grave and mathematical precision How often atoms may be subdivided By long division; O this is he that show'd I is not I, And made a ghost of personal identity; Proved “Ipse” absent by an alibi, And frisking in some other person's entity; He sounded all philosophies in truth, Whether old schemes or only supplemental:— And had, by virtue of his wisdom-tooth, A dental knowledge of the transcendental! The other is a shrewd severer wight, Sharp argument hath worn him nigh the bone: For why? he never let dispute alone, A logical knight-errant, That wrangled ever—morning, noon, and night, From night to morn: he had no wife apparent But Barbara Celárent! Woe unto him he caught in a dilemma, For on the point of his two fingers full He took the luckless wight, and gave with them a Most deadly toss, like any baited bull. Woe unto him that ever dared to breathe A sophism in his angry ear! for that He took ferociously between his teeth, And shook it—like a terrier with a rat!— In fact old Controversy ne'er begat One half so cruel And dangerous as he, in verbal duel! No one had ever so complete a fame As a debater; And for art logical his name was greater Than Dr. Watts's name!— Look how they sit together! Two bitter desperate antagonists, Licking each other with their tongues, like fists. Merely to settle whether This world of ours had ever a beginning— Whether created, Vaguely undated, Or Time had any finger in its spinning: When, lo!—for they are sitting at the basement— A hand, like that upon Belshazzar's wall, Lets fall A written paper through the open casement. “O foolish wits! (thus runs the document) To twist your brains into a double knot On such a barren question! Be content That there is such a fair and pleasant spot For your enjoyment as this verdant earth. Go eat and drink, and give your hearts to mirth, For vainly ye contend; Before you can decide about its birth, The world will have an end!” DEATH IN THE KITCHEN. “Are we not here now?” continued the corporal (striking the end of his stick perpendicularly on the floor, so as to give an idea of health and stability)—“and are we not” (dropping his hat upon the ground) “gone?—In a moment!” —Tristram Shandy. Trim, thou art right!—'Tis sure that I, And all who hear thee, are to die. The stoutest lad and wench Must lose their places at the will Of Death, and go at last to fill The sexton's gloomy trench. The dreary grave!—O, when I think How close we stand upon its brink, My inward spirit groans! My eyes are filled with dismal dreams Of coffins, and this kitchen seems A charnel full of bones! Yes, jovial butler, thou must fail, As sinks the froth on thine own ale; Thy days will soon be done! Alas! the common hours that strike, Are knells, for life keeps wasting, like A cask upon the run. Ay, hapless scullion! 'tis thy case, Life travels at a scouring pace, Far swifter than thy hand. The fast-decaying frame of man Is but a kettle or a pan Time wears away with—sand! Thou needst not, mistress cook! be told. The meat to-morrow will be cold That now is fresh and hot: E'en thus our flesh will, by and by, Be cold as stone:—Cook, thou must die; There's death within the pot. Susannah, too, my lady's maid, Thy pretty person once must aid To swell the buried swarm! The “glass of fashion” thou wilt hold No more, but grovel in the mould, That's not the “mould of form!” Yes, Jonathan, that drives the coach, He too will feel the fiend's approach— The grave will pluck him down: He must in dust and ashes lie, And wear the churchyard livery, Grass green, turn'd up with brown. How frail is our uncertain breath! The laundress seems full hale, but Death Shall her “last linen” bring. The groom will die, like all his kind; And e'en the stable boy will find This life no stable thing. Nay, see the household dog-even that The earth shall take;—the very cat Will share the common fall; Although she hold (the proverb saith) A ninefold life, one single death Suffices for them all! Cook, butler, Susan, Jonathan, The girl that scours the pot and pan, And those that tend the steeds— All, all shall have another sort Of service after this;—in short— The one the parson reads! The dreary grave!—O, when I think How close we stand upon its brink, My inward spirit groans! My eyes are filled with dismal dreams Of coffins, and this kitchen seems A charnel full of bones! REFLECTIONS ON A NEW YEAR'S DAY. Yes, yes, it's very true, and very clear! By way of compliment and common chat, It's very well to wish me a New Year; But wish me a new hat! Although not spent in luxury and ease, In course a longer life I won't refuse; But while you're wishing, wish me, if your please, A newer pair of shoes! Nay, while new things and wishes are afloat, I own to one that I should not rebut— Instead of this old rent, to have a coat With more of the New Cut! O yes, 'tis very pleasant, though I'm poor, To hear the steeple make that merry din; Except I wish one bell was at the door, To ring new trousers in. To be alive is very nice indeed, Although another year at last departs; Only with twelve new months I rather need A dozen of new shirts. Yes, yes, it's very true, and very clear, By way of compliment and common chat, It's very well to wish me a New Year, But wish me a new hat! ODE TO EDWARD GIBBON WAKEFIELD, ESQ. Oh, Mr. Gibbon!— I do not mean the Chronicler of Rome; He would have told thee loftily, that no man In modern times may play the antique Roman, And tear a Sabine virgin from her home:— But Mr. Gibbon, Thou,—with the surreptitious rib on, What shall I say to thee, thou Jason,—nay, What will our Wilberforce and Stephen say, Thou cruel kidnapper of young white woman! Were there no misses,—none All on the start and ready for a run To Gretna Smithy—even by the mail, That thou must go befooling A quiet maiden at her country schooling, And stop her lessons with an idle tale,— Sully the happy hue Of her calm thoughts, and trouble her sky-blue— Spoil her embroideries, and falsely wheedle Her pretty hand from the delightful needle, Merely to mar her piece, Planting those stitches in her maiden heart, That only should have made Rebecca smart, Or robed young Isaac in a silken fleece? Was there no willing Love, With roving eyes, More gay than wise, To bend with thy removal to remove? Could'st thou not calm the doubt Of Foote twice asked in vain, and ask her out? There's Madame Vestris—but she has a mate, And Paton hath as bad— But thou might'st add A single Cubitt to thy single state, Take such, and welcome to more wives than Buncle, Or gentle Olive, that Princess of No-Land, She owns some great expectancies in Poland, And has no follower-I mean no uncle!

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II. 1828. [Continued.] LAMIA; A ROMANCE. DRAMATIS PERSONÆ Apollonius, a philosopher, a sophist, tutor to Lycius. Lycius, a young man of noble birth, pupil to Apollonius. Mercutius, a young wild gallant of Corinth. Curio, a young wild gallant of Corinth. Gallo, and others, young wild gallants of Corinth. Julius, brother to Lycius. Domus (pro tempore), butler to Lamia. Picus (pro tempore), steward to Lamia. Lamia, an Enchantress, by nature a Serpent, but now under the disguise of a beautiful woman. [[SCENE I.]] The scene is in or near Corinth. A mossy Bank with Trees, on the high Road near Corinth. Enter Lamia. Lamia. Here I'll sit down and watch; till his dear foot Pronounce him to my ear. That eager hope Hath won me from the brook before I viewed My unacquainted self.—But yet it seemed A most rare change—and still methinks the change Has left the old fascination in my eyes. Look, here's a shadow of the shape I am— A dainty shadow! [She sits down on the bank. How fair the world seems now myself am fair! These dewy daffodils! these sweet green trees! I've coiled about their roots—but now I pluck Their drooping branches with this perfect hand! Sure those were Dryades That with such glancing looks peeped through the green To gaze upon my beauty. [Lycius enters and passes on without noting her. Lycius! sweet Lycius!—what, so cruel still! What have I done thou ne'er wilt deign a look, But pass me like a worm? LYCIUS. Ha! who art thou? [Looking back. O goddess, (for there is no mortal tint, No line about thee lower than divine,) What may that music mean, thy tuneful tongue Hath sent in chase of me?—I slight! I scorn thee! By all the light of day, till this kind hour I never saw that face!—nor one as fair. LAMIA. O fie, fie, fie!—what, have you never met That face at Corinth?—turned too oft towards you, Like the poor maiden's that adored Apollo:— You must have marked it!— LYCIUS. Nay, then hear me swear! By all Olympus and its starry thrones— My eyes have never chanced so sweet a sight, Not in my summer dreams!— LAMIA. Enough, enough!—why then I've watched in vain— Tracked all your ways, and followed like your shadow; Hung you with blessings—haunted you with love— And waited on your aspect—all in vain!— I might as well have spent my loving looks, Like Ariadne, on the sullen sea, And hoped for a reflection. Youth, farewell. LYCIUS. O not yet—not yet farewell! Let such an unmatched vision still shine on, Till I have set an impress in my heart To cope with life's decay! LAMIA. You say but well. I must soon hie me to my elements; But take your pleasure at my looks till then. LYCIUS. You are not of this earth, then? [Sadly. LAMIA. Of this earth? Why not? And of this same and pleasant isle. My world is yours, and I would have no other. One earth, one sea, one sky, in one horizon, Our room is wide enough, unless you hate me. LYCIUS. Hate you! LAMIA. Then you may wish to set the stars between us, The dim and utter lamps of east and west. So far you'd have me from you. LYCIUS. Cruel Syren! To set your music to such killing speech. Look if my eyes turn from you—if my brows, Or any hinting feature, show dislike. Nay, hear my lips— LAMIA. If they will promise love Or talk of it; but chide, and you will kill me! LYCIUS. Then, love, speak forth a promise for thyself, And all heaven's witnesses be by to hear thee.— LAMIA. Hold, hold! I'm satisfied. You'll love me, then? LYCIUS. With boundless, endless love. LAMIA. Ay, give me much on't—for you owe me much, If you knew all. I've licked the very dust whereon you tread— LYCIUS. It is not true! LAMIA. I'll swear it, if you will. Jove heard the words, And knows they are sadly true. LYCIUS. And this for me LAMIA. Ay, sweet, and more. A poor, fond wretch, I filled The flowers with my tears; and lay supine In coverts wild and rank—fens, horrid, desolate! 'Twould shock your very soul if you could see How this poor figure once was marred and vilified, How grovelled and debased; contemned and hated By my own self, because, with all its charms, It then could hope no favor in your eyes; And so I hid it, With toads and newts, and hideous shiny things, Under old ruins, in vile solitudes, Making their haunts my own. LYCIUS. 'Tis strange and piteous.—Why, then, you maddened? LAMIA. I was not quite myself—(not what I am)— Yet something of the woman stayed within me, To weep she was not dead. LYCIUS. Is this no fable? LAMIA. O most distrustful Lycius! Hear me call On Heaven, anew, for vouchers to these facts. [It thunders. There! Could'st thou question that? Sweet skies I thank ye! Now, Lycius, doubt me if you may or can; And leave me if you will. I can but turn The wretched creature that I was, again, Crushed by our equal hate. Once more, farewell. LYCIUS. Farewell, but not till death. O gentlest, dearest, Forgive my doubts. I have but paused till now To ask if so much bliss could be no dream. Now I am sure— Thus I embrace it with my whole glad heart For ever and for ever; I could weep. Thy tale hath shown me such a matchless love, It makes the elder chronicles grow dim. I always thought I wandered all uncared for on my way, Betide me good or ill—nor caused more tears Than hung upon my sword. Yet I was hung With dews, rich pearly dews—shed from such spheres As sprinkle them in amber. Thanks, bounteous stars. Henceforth you shall but rain your beams upon me To bless my brightened days. LAMIA. O sweet! sweet! sweet! To hear you parley thus and gaze upon you! Lycius, dear Lycius! But tell me, dearest, will you never—never Think lightly of myself, nor scorn a love Too frankly set before you! because 'twas given Unasked, though you should never give again: Because it was a gift and not a purchase— A boon, and not a debt; not love for love, Where one half's due for gratitude. LYCIUS. Thrice gracious seems thy gift! LAMIA. Oh, no! Oh, no! I should have made you wait, and beg, and kneel, And swear as though I could but half believe you; I have not even stayed to prove your patience By crosses and feigned slights—given you no time For any bribing gifts or costly shows. I know you will despise me. LYCIUS. Never, never So long as I have sight within these balls, Which only now I've learned to thank the gods for. LAMIA. 'Tis prettily sworn; and frankly I'll believe you! Now shall we on our way? I have a house (Till now no home) within the walls of Corinth: Will you not master it as well as me? LYCIUS. My home is in your heart; but where you dwell, There is my dwelling-place. But let me bear you, sweet! LAMIA. No, I can walk, if you will charm the way With such discourse; it makes my heart so light, I seem to have wings within; or, if I tire, I'll lean upon you thus. LYCIUS. So lean for ever! [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Market-place at Corinth. Apollonius is discovered discoursing with various young Gallants, namely, Mercutius, Curio, &amp;c. APOLLONIUS. Hush, sirs! You raise a tingling blush about my ears, That drink such ribaldry and wanton jests— For shame!—for shame!— You misapply good gifts the gods have granted! MERCUTIUS. The gods have made us tongues—brains, too, I hope— And time will bring us beards. You sages think Minerva's owl dwells only in such bushes. CURIO. Ha! ha!—Why we'll have wigs upon our chins— Long grizzled ones—and snarl about the streets, Hugged up in pride and spleen like any mantle, And be philosophers! APOLLONIUS. You will do wisely. CURIO. Ay—I hope—why not? Though age has heaped no winter on our pates. Is wisdom such a frail and spoiling thing It must be packed in ice? GALLO. Or sopped in vinegar? APOLLONIUS. We would you were more gray— MERCUTIUS. Why, would you have us gray before our time? Oh, Life's poor capital is too soon spent Without discounting it. Pray do not grudge us Our share;—a little wine—a little love— A little youth!—a little, little folly, Since wisdom has the gross. When they are past, We'll preach with you, and call 'em vanities. APOLLONIUS. No!—leave that to your mummies. Sure your act Will purchase you an embalming. Let me see!— Here's one hath spent his fortune on a harlot, And—if he kept to one it was a merit!— The next has rid the world of so much wine— Why that's a benefit. And you, Sir Plume, Have turned your Tailor to a Senator;— You've made no man the worse—(for manner's sake; My speech exempts yourself). You've all done well; If not, your dying shall be placed to your credit. CURIO. You show us bravely—could you ever praise one? APOLLONIUS. One? and no more! why then I answer, yes— Or rather, no; for I could never praise him. He's as beyond my praise as your complexion— I wish you'd take a pattern!— CURIO. Of whose back, sir? APOLLONIUS. Ay, there you must begin and try to match The very shadow of his virtuous worth, Before you're half a man. MERCUTIUS. Who is this model? An ape—an Afric ape—what he and Plato Conspire to call a Man. APOLLONIUS. Then you're a man already; but no model, So I must set my own example up; To show you Virtue, Temperance, and Wisdom, And in a youth too!— Not in a withered graybeard like myself, In whom some virtues are mere worn-out vices, And wisdom but a due and tardy fruit. He, like the orange, bears both fruit and flower Upon his odorous bough—the fair and ripe!— CURIO. Why, you can praise too! APOLLONIUS. As well as I dispraise:—They're both in one, Since you're disparaged when I talk of graces. For example, when I say that he I spoke of Is no wild sin-monger—no sot—no dicer, No blasphemer o' th' gods—no shameless scoffer, No ape—no braggart—no foul libertine— Oh no— He hugs no witching wanton to his heart, He keeps no vices he's obliged to muffle;— But pays a filial honour to gray hairs, And guides him by that voice, Divine Philosophy. GALLO. Well, he's a miracle!—and what's he called? (ALL.) Ay, who is he?—who is he? APOLLONIUS. His name is Lycius. CURIO. Then he's coming yonder:— Lord, how these island fogs delude our eyes! I could have sworn to a girl too with him. APOLLONIUS. Ay, ay—you know these eyes can shoot so far, Or else the jest were but a sorry one. CURIO. Mercutius sees her too. MERCUTIUS. In faith, I do, sir. APOLLONIUS. Peace, puppies!—nine days hence you will see truer. CURIO. Nay, but by all the gods— GALLO. We'll take our oath on't. APOLLONIUS. Peace, peace! (aside) I see her too—This is some mockery, Illusion, damned illusion!— What, ho! Lycius! [Lycius (entering) wishes to pass aside. Lamia clings close to him. LAMIA. Hark!—who is that!—quick, fold me in your mantle; Don't let him see my face!— LYCIUS. Nay, fear not, sweet— 'Tis but old Apollonius, my sage guide. LAMIA. Don't speak to him—don't stay him—let him pass!— I have a terror of those graybeard men— They frown on Love with such cold churlish brows. That sometimes he hath flown!— LYCIUS. Ay, he will chide me; But do not you fear aught. Why, how you tremble! LAMIA. Pray shroud me closer. I am cold—death cold!— [Old Apollonius comes up, followed by the Gallants. APOLLONIUS. My son, what have you here? LYCIUS. A foolish bird that flew into my bosom:— You would not drive him hence? APOLLONIUS. Well, let me see it; I have some trifling skill in augury, And can divine you from its beak and eyes What sort of fowl it is. LYCIUS. I have learned that, sir;— 'Tis what is called—a dove—sacred to Venus:— [The Youths laugh, and pluck Apollonius by the sleeve. APOLLONIUS. Fool! drive it out! [To Lycius. LYCIUS. No, not among these hawks here. APOLLONIUS. Let's see it, then. (ALL.) Ay, ay, old Graybeard, you say well for once; Let's see it;—let's see it!— APOLLONIUS. And sure it is no snake—to suit the fable— You've nestled in your bosom? LAMIA (under the mantle). Lost! lost! lost!— MERCUTIUS. Hark! the dove speaks—I knew it was a parrot!— APOLLONIUS. Dear Lycius—my own son (at least till now), Let me forewarn you, boy!— LYCIUS. No, peace, I will not. CURIO. There spoke a model for you. APOLLONIUS. O Lycius, Lycius! My eyes are shocked, and half my age is killed, To see your noble self so ill accompanied!— LYCIUS. And, sir, my eyes are shocked too—Fie! is this A proper retinue—for those gray hairs? A troop of scoffing boys!—Sirs, by your leave I must and will pass on. [To the Gallants. MERCUTIUS. That as you can, sir— LYCIUS. Why then this arm has cleared a dozen such. [They scuffle: in the tumult Apollonius is overturned. APOLLONIUS. Unhappy boy!—this overthrow's your own!— [Lycius frees himself and Lamia, and calls back. LYCIUS. Lift—help him—pick him up!—fools—braggarts—apes— Step after me who dares!— [Exit with Lamia. GALLO. Whew!—here's a model!— How fare you, sir (to Apollonius)—your head?—I fear Your wisdom has suffered by this fall. APOLLONIUS. My heart aches more. O Lycius! Lycius!— CURIO. Hark! he calls his model!— 'Twas a brave pattern. We shall never match him. Such wisdom and such virtues—in a youth too! He keeps no muffled vices. MERCUTIUS. No! no! not he!— Nor hugs no naughty wantons in his arsm— CURIO. But pays a filial honor to gray hairs, And listens to thy voice—Divine Philosophy! [They run off, laughing and mocking. APOLLONIUS. You have my leave to jest. The gods unravel This hellish witchery that hides my scholar! O Lycius! Lycius! [Exit Apollonius. SCENE III. A rich Chamber, with Pictures and Statues. Enter Domus unsteadily, with a flask in his hand. DOMUS. Here's a brave palace! [Looking round. Why, when this was spread Gold was as cheap as sunshine. How it's stuck All round about the walls. Your health, brave palace! Ha! Brother Picus! Look! are you engaged too? (Enter Picus.) Hand us your hand: you see I'm butler here. How came you hither? PICUS. How? Why a strange odd man— A sort of foreign slave, I think—addressed me I' the market, waiting for my turn, Like a beast of burthen, and hired me for this service. DOMUS. So I was hired, too. PICUS. 'Tis a glorious house! But come, let's kiss the lips of your bottle. DOMUS. Ay, but be modest: wine is apt to blush! PICUS. 'Tis famous beverage: It makes me reel i' the head. DOMUS. I believe ye, boy. Why, since I sipped it—(mind, I'd only sipped)— I've had such glorious pictures in my brains— Such rich rare dreams! Such blooms, and rosy bowers, and tumbling fountains, With a score of moons shining at once upon me— I never saw such sparkling! [Drinks. PICUS. Here's a vision! DOMUS. The sky was always bright; or, if it gloomed, The very storms came on with scented waters, And, if it snowed, 'twas roses; claps of thunder Seemed music, only louder; nay, in the end, Died off in gentle ditties. Then, such birds! And gold and silver chafers bobbed about; And when there came a little gush of wind, The very flowers took wing and chased the butterflies! PICUS. Egad, 'tis very sweet. I prithee, dearest Domus, Let me have one small sup! DOMUS. No! hear me out. The hills seemed made of cloud, bridges of rainbows. The earth like trodden smoke. Nothing at all was heavy, gross, or human: Mountains, with climbing cities on their backs, Shifted about like castled elephants; You might have launched the houses on the sea, And seen them swim like galleys! The stones I pitched i' the ponds would barely sink— I could have lifted them by tons. [Drinks. PICUS. Dear Domus, let me paint, too—dear, dear Domus. DOMUS. Methought I was all air—Jove! I was feared, I had not flesh enough to hold me down From mounting up to the moon. At every step— Bounce! when I only thought to stride a pace, I bounded thirty. PICUS. Thirty! Oh, let me drink! DOMUS. And that too when I'd even eat or drank At the rate of two meals to the hour! [Drinks. PICUS. Two meals to the hour—nay Domus—let me drink, Dear Domus let me drink—before 'tis empty!— DOMUS. But then my fare was all so light and delicate, The fruits, the cakes, the meats so dainty frail, They would not bear a bite—no, not a munch, But melted away like ice. Come, here's the bottle! PICUS. Thanks, Domus—Pshaw, it's empty!—Well, who cares— There's something thin and washy after all In these poor visions. They all end in emptiness, Like this. [Turns down the bottle. DOMUS. Then fill again, boy—fill again! And be ?. I say, look there!— PICUS. It is our Lady! [Lamia enters leaning upon Lycius. DOMUS. Our Lady's very welcome: (bowing) yours, my lady— Sir, your poor butler: (to Lycius) Picus—man—speak up, The very same that swam so in my dreams; I had forgot the goddess!— LAMIA. Peace, rude knave! You've tasted what belonged to nobler brains, And maddened!—My sweet love (to Lycius) twas kept for you, 'Tis nature's choicest vintage. (to Domus) Drink no more, sir! Except what I'll provide you. DOMUS. O sweet Lady! Lord, and I had a cup I'd thank you in it!— But you've been drunk—sweet lady—you've been drunk! Here's Master Picus knows—for we drunk you. PICUS. Not I, in faith. LYCIUS. Ha! ha! my gentle love, Methinks your butler should have been your steward. DOMUS. Why you are merry, sir— And well you may. Look here's a house we've come to! O Jupiter! Look here are pictures, sir, and here's our statues! That's Bacchus! [Pointing. And there's Apollo—just aiming at the serpent. LAMIA. Peace, fool—my dearest Lycius, Pray send him forth. LYCIUS. Sirrah, take him off! [To Steward. PICUS. Fie, Domus—know your place. DOMUS. My place, slave! What, don't I know my place? [Falls on his back. Ain't I the butler? LYCIUS. No more—no more—there—pull him out by the heels— [Domus is dragged out. (To Lamia.) My most dear love—how fares it with you now? Your cheek is somewhat pale. LAMIA. Indeed, I'm weary, We'll not stay here—I have some cheer provided In a more quiet chamber. Exeunt. SCENE IV. A Street in Corinth; on one side a very noble building, which is the residence of Lamia. Mercutius, with the other Gallants, come and discourse in front of the house. MERCUTIUS. So, here they're lodged! In faith a pretty nest! GALLO. The first that led us hither for revenge— O brave Mercutius! CURIO. Now my humor's different, For while there's any stone left in the market-place That hurt these bones, when that pert chick o'erset us, I'd never let him sleep!— GALLO. Nor I, by Nemesis! I'd pine him to a ghost for want of rest. To the utter verge of death. MERCUTIUS. And then you'd beat him. Is that your noble mind? GALLO. Lo! here's a turncoat! D'ye hear him, gentles?—he's come here to fool us! MERCUTIUS. Not I; but that I'm turned, I will confess it; For as we came—in thinking over this— Of Lycius, and the lady whom I glanced Crouching within his mantle— Her most distressful look came so across me— Her death-white cheeks— That I, for one, can find no heart to fret her. CURIO. Shall Lycius then go free? MERCUTIUS. Ay, for her sake:— But do your pleasure; it is none of mine. Exit. GALLO. Why, a false traitor! CURIO. Sirs, I can expound him; He's smit—he's passion-smit—I heard him talk Of her strange witching eyes—such rare ones That they turned him cold as stone. GALLO. Why let him go then—but we'll to our own. CURIO. Ay, let's be plotting How we can vent our spites on this Sir Lycius— I own it stirs my spleen, more than my bruises, To see him fare so well—hang him!—a model!— One that was perked too, underneath our noses, For virtue and for temperance. I have a scheme will grieve 'em without end: I planned it by the way. You know this fellow, Lycius, has a father Some fifteen leagues away. We'll send him thither By some most urgent message. GALLO. Bravely plotted: His father shall be dying. Ah! 'tis excellent. I long to attempt the lady;—nay, we'll set Mercutius, too, upon her! Pray, let's to it. Look! here's old Ban-dog. Apollonius appears in the distance. CURIO. Nay, but I will act Some mischief ere I go. There's for thee, Lycius! [He casts a stone through the window, and they run off. Enter Apollonius. APOLLONIUS. Go to, ye silly fools!—Lo! here's a palace! I have grown gray in Corinth, but my eyes Never remember it. Who is the master? Some one is coming forth. Lycius again! [Lycius comes out disordered, with his face flushed, and reels up to Apollonius. LYCIUS. Why, how now, Graybeard? What! are these your frolics, To sound such rude alarum in our ears? Go to! APOLLONIUS. Son, do you know me? LYCIUS. Know you? Why? Or how? You have no likeness in our skies! Gray hairs and such sour looks! You'd be a wonder! We have nothing but bright faces. Hebes, Venuses; No age, no frowns! No wrinkle, but our laughter shakes in wine. I wish you'd learn to drink. APOLLONIUS. O Lycius! Lycius! Would you had never learned to drink, except those springs We supped together! These are mortal draughts;— Your cup is drugged with death! LYCIUS. Grave sir, you lie! I'm a young god. Look! do you not behold The new wings on my shoulders? You may die; That moss upon your chin proclaims you're mortal, And feel decays of age. But I'm renewable At every draught I take! Here, Domus! Domus! Enter Domus. Bring a full cup of nectar for this churl. [Exit Domus. 'Twill give you back your youth, sir—ay, like magic— And lift you o'er the clouds. You'll dream of nothing That's meaner than Olympus. Smiling goddesses Will haunt you in your sleep. You'll walk on flowers, And never crush their heads. Enter Domus with wine. APOLLONIUS. Peace, madman, peace! None of your draughts for me—your magic potions, That stuff your brains with such pernicious cheats! I say, bear off the bowl! LYCIUS. What!—will he not?— Then cast it over him—'twill do as well;— He shall be a demi-god against his will. Cast it, I say!— [To Domus. DOMUS. 'Tis such a sinful waste! Why, there, then—there! [He throws it over Apollonius. Look how it falls to the ground! Lord, you might soak him in it year by year, And never plump him up to a comely youth Like you or me, sir!— LYCIUS. Let him go. Farewell!— Look, foolish Graybeard—I am going back To what your wisdom scorned. A minute hence My soul is in Elysium! [Exit with Domus APOLLONIUS. Fool, farewell! Why, I was sprinkled; yet I feel no wet. 'Tis strange!—this is some magic, against which Philosophy is proof. I must untangle it. Hold!— [He stands in meditation. I have it faintly dawning in my brain. 'Tis somewhere in my books (which I'll refer to)— Speaking of Nature's monstrous prodigies, That there be witching snakes—Circean births— Who, by foul spells and forgeries, can take The mask and shape of woman—fair externe, But viperous within. And so they creep Into young hearts, and falsify the brain With juggling mockeries. Alas, poor boy, If this should be thy case! These are sad tales To send unto thy father. [Mercutius enters without perceiving Apollonius: going up to Lamia's house, he recollects himself. MERCUTIUS. Here again? What folly led me hither? I thought I was Proceeding homeward. Why I've walked a circle And end where I began! [Apollonius goes up and calls in his ear. APOLLONIUS. I'll tell you, dreamer; It's magic, it's vile magic brought you hither, And made you walk in a fog. There, think of that;—be wise, and save yourself! I've better men to care for! [Exit Apollonius. MERCUTIUS. What did he say? The words were drowned in my ear by something sweeter. [A strain of wild music within the house. Music! rare music!—It must be her voice; I ne'er heard one so thrilling! Is it safe To listen to a song so syren-sweet—so exquisite?— That I might hold my breath, entranced, and die Of ardent listening? She is a miracle! Enter Domus. Look, here's a sot will tell me all he knows. One of her servants— Is that your lady's voice? (to Domus) her pipe's a rare one. DOMUS. Ay, marry. If you heard it sound within, Till it makes the glasses chime, and all the bottles, You'd think yourself in heaven. MERCUTIUS. I wish she'd sing again. DOMUS. And if you saw her eyes, how you would marvel! I have seen my master watch them, and fall back Like a man in his fits. I'm rather dizzy, And drunken-like myself. The vile quandaries Her beauty brings one into— [Staggers about. Ay, I'm crazed. But you should see our Picus— Lord, how he stands agape, till he drops his salver, And then goes down on his knees. MERCUTIUS. And so should I, Had I been born to serve her! [Sighs. DOMUS. Why you shall, boy; And have a leather jerkin—marry, shall you! We need a helper sadly. I'm o'er-burdened (You see how I am burdened); but I'll teach you What manners you may want. MERCUTIUS. Well, I'm for you— (I will dislike no place that brings me near her)— Mind, you have 'listed me. DOMUS. And I can promise You'll not dislike your fare—'tis excellent, light As well as savoury, and will not stuff you; But when you've eat your stretch to the outer button, In half an hour you'll hunger. It is all feasting, With barely a tithe of fasting. Then such drinking! There's such a cellar! One hundred paces long (for I have paced it), By about two hundred narrow. Come along, boy! [Exeunt. SCENE V. A Chamber in Lamia's House. Lamia and Lycius are discovered sitting on a couch. LAMIA. Nay, sweet-lipped Silence, 'Tis now your turn to talk. I'll not be cheated Of any of my pleasures; which I shall be, Unless I sometimes listen. LYCIUS. Pray talk on, A little further on. You have not told me What country bore you, that my heart may set Its name in a partial place. Nay, your own name— Which ought to be my better word for beauty— I know not. LAMIA. Wherefore should I talk of such things I care not to remember? A lover's memory Looks back no further than when love began, As if the dawn o' the world. As for my birth—suppose I like to think That we were dropped from two strange several stars (Being thus meant for one), why should you wish A prettier theory, or ask my name, As if I did not answer, heart and eyes, To those you call me by? In sooth, I will not Provide you with a worse. LYCIUS. Then I must find it. Now I am but puzzled To compound sweet superlatives enough In all the world of words. [Domus enters boisterously with a letter. DOMUS. An express! an express! Faith, I've expressed it. I did not even wait (aside) To pry between the folds. [Lycius takes the letter, and reads in great agitation. Lamia watches him. LAMIA. Alas! what news is this? Lycius! dear Lycius! Why do you clutch your brow so? What has chanced To stab you with such grief? Speak! speak! LYCIUS. My father! LAMIA. Dead? LYCIUS. Dying—dying—if not dead by this. I must leave you instantly. LAMIA. Alas! I thought This fair-eyed day would never see you from me! But must you go, indeed? LYCIUS. I must! I must! This is some fierce and fearful malady To fall so sudden on him. Why, I left him, No longer since—ay, even when I met you We had embraced that morn. LAMIA. It was but yesterday! How soon our bliss is marred! And must you leave me? LYCIUS. Oh! do not ask again with such a look, Or I shall linger here and pledge my soul To everlasting shame and keen remorse! LAMIA. The Fates are cruel! Yet let me cling to thee and weep awhile: We may not meet again. I cannot feel You are safe but in these arms! [She embraces him. LYCIUS. I'm split asunder By opposite factions of remorse and love; But all my soul clings here. DOMUS. It makes me weep. He will not see his father. [Lycius casts himself on the couch. LAMIA (striking Domus). Wretch! take that, For harrowing up his griefs! Dearest!—my Lycius! Lean not your brow upon that heartless pillow! DOMUS. How he groaned then! LAMIA. Lycius, you fright me! You turn me cold! LYCIUS (rising up). Oh! in that brief rest, I've had a waking vision of my father! Even as he lay on his face and groaned for me, And shed like bitter tears! Oh, how those groans will count in heaven against me! One for pain's cruelty, but two for mine, That gave a sting to his anguish. His dying breath will mount to the skies and curse me. His angered ghost Will haunt my sight, and when I'd look upon you Step in like a blot between us. LAMIA. Go, go! or you will hate me. Go and leave me! If I now strive by words or tears to stay you For my pleasure's sake or pain's, You'd say there was something brutal in my nature Of cold and fiendish, and unlike woman; Some taint that devilish— Yet give me one long look before you go— One last long look! [She fixes her eyes on his. LYCIUS. O gods! my spirit fails me, And I have no strength to go, although I would! LAMIA. Perhaps he is dead already! LYCIUS. Ha! Why, then, What can I? Or, if not, what can I still? Can I keep him from his urn? or give him breath? Or replenish him with blood? LAMIA. Alas! alas! Would I had art or skill enough to heal him! LYCIUS. Ay, art and skill, indeed, do more than love In such extremities. Stay! here, hard by, There dwells a learned and most renowned physician, Hath wrought mere miracles. Him I'll engage, armed with our vows and prayers, To spend his utmost study on my father, And promptly visit him. A short farewell. [Exit. Domus follows. LAMIA. Farewell—be not o'er long. It made me tremble That he should see his father! The oldest eyes Look through some fogs that young ones cannot fathom, And lay bare mysteries. Ah me! how frail Are my foundations! Dreams, mere summer dreams, Which, if a day-beam pierce, return to nothing! And let in sadder shows. A foot—so soon! Why, then, my wishes hold. Enter Domus and Picus. DOMUS. He's gone! he's gone! He had not snuffed the air, outside o' the gate, When it blew a change in his mind. He bade me tell you, A voice from the sky-roof, where the gods look down, Commanded him to his father. LAMIA. No more! no more! (The skies begin, then, to dispute my charms.) But did he ne'er turn back? DOMUS. Ay, more than twice He turned on his heel, and stood—then turned again, And tramped still quicker as he got from hence, Till at last he ran like a lapwing! LAMIA. This is a tale Coined by the silly drunkard. You, sir, speak. [To Picus. PICUS. Nay, by our troths— LAMIA. Then, sirrah, do not speak. If such vile sense be truth, I've had too much on't. Hence! fly! or I will kill you with a frown. You've maddened me! PICUS. I saw her eyes strike fire! [Picus and Domus run out. Lamia looks round the chamber LAMIA. Alone! alone! Then, Lamia, weep, and mend your shatter-web, And hang your tears, like morning dew, upon it. Look how your honey-bee has broken loose Through all his meshes, and now wings away, Showing the toils were frail. Ay, frail as gossamers That stretch from rose to rose. Some adverse power Confronts me, or he could not tear them thus. Some evil eye has pierced my mystery! A blight is in its ken! I feel my charms decay—my will's revoked— And my keen sight, once a prophetic sense, Is blinded with a cloud, horrid and black, Like a veil before the face of Misery! Another Apartment in Lamia's House. Enter Julius (Lycius's brother) and Domus. JULIUS. Rumour has not belied the house i' the least; 'Tis all magnificent. I pray you, sir, How long has your master been gone? DOMUS. About two quarts, sir; That is, as long as one would be a drinking 'em. 'Tis a very little while since he set off, sir. JULIUS. You keep a strange reckoning. Where is your mistress? Will she see me? DOMUS. Ay, marry; That is, if you meet; for it is good broad daylight. JULIUS. This fellow's manners speak but ill for the house. (Aside.) Go, sirrah, to your lady, with my message: Tell her one Julius, Lycius's best friend, Desires a little converse. Exit Domus Now for this miracle, whose charms have bent The straightest stem of youth strangely awry— My brother Lycius! He was not use to let his inclination Thus domineer his reason: the cool, grave shade Of Wisdom's porch dwelt ever on his brow And governed all his thoughts, keeping his passions Severely chastened. Lo! she comes. How wondrously Her feet glide o'er the ground. Ay, she is beautiful! So beautiful, my task looks stern beside her, And duty faints like doubt. Enter Lamia. Oh, thou sweet fraud! Thou fair excuse for sin, whose matchless cheek Vies blushes with the shame it brings upon thee, Thou delicate forgery of love and virtue, Why art thou as thou art, not what here seems So exquisitely promised? LAMIA. Sir, do you know me? If not—and my near eyes declare you strange— Mere charity should make you think me better. JULIUS. Oh, would my wishful thought could think no worse Than I might learn by gazing. Why are not those sweet looks—those heavenly looks, True laws to judge thee by, and call thee perfect? 'Tis pity, indeed 'tis pity, That anything so fair should be a fraud! LAMIA. Sir, I beseech you, wherefore do you hang These elegies on me? For pity's sake What do you take me for? No woman, sure, By aiming thus to wound me (weeping). JULIUS. Ay, call these tears Into your ready eyes! I'd have them scald Your cheeks until they fade, and wear your beauty To a safe and ugly ruin. Those fatal charms Can show no sadder wreck than they have brought On many a noble soul, and noble mind. Pray count me: How many men's havocks might forerun the fall Of my lost brother Lycius? LAMIA. Are you his brother? Then I'll not say a word to vex you: not a look Shall aim at your offence. You are come to chide me. I know, for winning him to sell his heart At such a worthless rate. Yet I will hear you, Patiently, thankfully, for his dear sake. I will be as mild and humble as a worm Beneath your just rebuke. 'Tis sure no woman Deserved him; but myself the least of all, Who fall so far short in his value. JULIUS. She touches me! (Aside.) LAMIA. Look, sir, upon my eyes. Are they not red? Within an hour, I've rained a flood of tears. To feel, to know I am no better than the thing I am, Having but just now learned to rate my vileness. You cannot charge My unworthy part so bitterly as I do. If there's about me anything that's honest, Of true and womanly, it belongs to Lycius, And all the rest is Grief's. JULIUS. Then I'll not grieve you— I came with frowns, but I depart in tears And sorrow for you both; for what he was, And what you might have been—a pair of wonders. The grace and pride of nature—now disgraced, And fallen beyond redress. LAMIA. You wring my heart! JULIUS. Ay, if you think how you have made him stain The fair-blown pride of his unblemished youth, His studious years— And for what poor exchange? these fading charms— I will not say how frail. LAMIA. O hold—pray hold! Your words have subtle cruel stings, and pierce More deeply than you aim! This sad heart knows How little of such wrong and spiteful ill Were in love's contemplation when it clasped him! Lycius and bliss made up my only thought; But now, alas! A sudden truth dawns on me, like a light Through the remainder tatters of a dream, And shows my bliss in shreds. JULIUS. I pity you! Nay, doubtless, you will be, some wretched day, A perished cast-off weed when found no flower— Or else even then, his substance being gone, My brother's heart will break at your desertion. LAMIA. O never, never! [Fervently. Never, by holy truth! while I am woman Be false what may, at least my heart is honest. Look round you, sir; this wealth, such as it is, Once mine, is now all his; and when 'tis spent, I'll beg for him, toil for him, steal for him! God knows how gladly I would share his lot This speaking moment in a humble shed, Like any of our peasants!—ay, lay these hands To rude and rugged tasks, expose these cheeks You are pleased to flatter, to the ardent sun; So we might only live in safe pure love And constant partnership—never to change In each other's hearts and eyes! JULIUS. You mend your fault. This late fragmental virtue much redeems you; Pray, cherish it. Hark! what a lawless riot. [A loud boisterous shout is heard from below. O hope—Again! (the noise renewed) why then this is a triumph Of your true fame, which I had just mistaken; Shame on thee, smooth dissembler—shame upon thee! Is this the music of your songs of sorrow, And well-feigned penitence—lo! here, are these Your decent retinue— Enter the wild Gallants, flushed with wine. LAMIA. Sir, by Heaven's verity I do not know a face! indeed I do not; They are strange to me as the future. CURIO. Then the future Must serve us better, chuck. Here, bully mates, These, lady, are my friends, and friends of Lycius! JULIUS. Is it so?—then Lycius is fallen indeed! CURIO. Ay, he has had his trip—as who has not, sir? I'll warrant you've had your stumbles. JULIUS. Once—on an ape. Get out o' the way of my shins. [Going. LAMIA. Sir, dearest sir, In pity do not go, for your brother's sake, If not for mine—take up my guardianship 'Gainst these ungentle men. [She lays hold of Julius. JULIUS. Off, wanton, off! Would you have me of your crew, too? Exit roughly. GALLO. Let him go!— He has a graft in him of that sour crab, The Apollonius—let him go, a churl! CURIO. Sweet lady, you look sad—fie, it was ill done of Lycius To leave his dove so soon—but he has some swan At nest in another place. GALLO. I'll bet my mare on't. LAMIA. Kind sirs, indeed I'm sorry Your friend's not here. If he were by, He would help you to your welcome. CURIO. We've no doubt on't; [Bitterly. But we'll not grieve, since here we are quite enough For any merriment. GALLO. And as for a welcome, We'll acknowledge it on your cheer. LAMIA. Then that's but sorry, sir, If you mean what lies in my heart. GALLO. No, no, in faith, We mean what lies in your cellar—wine, rare wine, We will pledge you in floods on't, and when knocked off our legs, Adore you on our knees. LAMIA. Hear me, sweet gentles, How you shall win my favour. Set to work and copy— Be each a Lycius. GALLO. Lycius, forsooth! hang him! A model again! the perfect model! CURIO. As if we could not match his vices! Pray ask your Lycius, when he's new come back (If ever he come back), What his father ailed, or if he ailed at all, And how it ailed too, that his brother Julius Got no such forged advice. GALLO. It had charmed your heart to see how swift he ran (Whether to get from hence or gain elsewhere, I know not), but I never saw such striving, Save at the Olympic games to win the goal. (ALL.) Ha! ha! ha! LAMIA. Laugh on, I pray, laugh on. Ye puny spites! You think to fret me with those ill-coined tales; But look, I join in your glee, [She attempts to laugh. Or if I cannot, 'tis because I'm choked with a curse. [She hurries out. GALLO. It works! it wings her! What shall we next? Follow her, or carry her off? CURIO. These are too violent, And perilous to ourselves; but I will fit Our revenge to its other half. Sir Lycius now Must have the green eye set in his head, and then They'll worry each other's hearts without our help. Julius or Apollonius will be our ready organs To draw his ear. GALLO. 'Tis plausible, and cannot fail to part 'em, And when he has shaken her from off his bough It needs she must fall to us. CURIO. I wonder where That poor sick fool Mercutius is gone? He hath a chance now. GALLO. Methought I glanced him Below, and, forsooth, disguised as a serving-man; But he avoided me. CURIO. The subtle fox! Let us go beat him up. [Exeunt, hallooing. SCENE VI. The Street before Lamia's House. Enter Apollonius with Julius. APOLLONIUS. I say she is a snake— JULIUS. And so say I; APOLLONIUS. But not in the same sense— JULIUS. No, not exactly. You take that literal, which I interpret But as a parable—a figure feigned By the elder sages (much inclined to mark Their subtle meanings in dark allegories) For those poisonous natures—those bewitching sins— That armed and guarded with a woman's husk, But viperous within, seduce young hearts, And sting where they are cherished. APOLLONIUS. Your guess is shrewd; Nay, excellent enough to have been my own. But, hark you, I have read in elder oracles Than ever you will quote, the fact which backs me. In Greece, in the midst of Greece, it hath been known, And attested upon oath, i' the faith of multitudes, That such true snakes have been—real hissing serpents, Though outwardly like women. With one of such, a youth, a hopeful youth, Sober, discreet, and able to subdue His passions otherwise—even like our Lycius— For a fortnight lived in a luxury of wealth, Till suddenly she vanished, palace and all, Like the shadow of a cloud. JULIUS. The dainty fable! But now unto the proof. Methinks this sounds Like a real door (knocking); a cloud scarce wars so, But when Jove strikes it with a thunderbolt. I'll tell you, sir, She is a wanton, and that's quite enough To perish a world of wealth. [Picus comes to the door. Ho, sirrah! fellow! Is your lady now within? PICUS. No, sir, she's out. Something hath put her out—she will see nobody. She's ill, she's grievous bad—her head won't bear The rout of company. [A loud shout without. APOLLONIUS. Why, then, I think The medical conclave might observe more quiet. Look, knave! are these her grave, her learned physicians? Well met, sirs. [Another shout, and Curio, &amp;c., issue forth. CURIO. That's as may be. Ha! old mastiff! Go to your kennel. JULIUS. You are just in time, sirs, To settle our dispute: we have a gage on't, The sophist here and I. There is one lives in that house—(pointing to Lamia's)—how would you call her? A woman? CURIO. Ay; and sure a rare one, As I have proved upon her lips. [Lamia opens a window gently and listens. GALLO. Ay, marry, have we! She was kind enough, for our poor sakes, to send One Lycius, her late suitor, on an errand That will make him footsore. CURIO. Yes, a sort of summons Cunningly forged to bid him haste to his father, Who lay in the jaws of death. Lord, how he'll swear To find the old cock quite well! JULIUS. This is too true. [To Apollonius. I left our father but this very morn The halest of old men. He was then on his way Toward this city, on some state affair. They'll encounter upon the road! APOLLONIUS. Here is some foul and double-damned deception. [Lamia, by signs, assents to this reflection. I'll catechise myself. Here, sir—you—you— [To Curio. Who have gazed upon this witch, touched her, and talked with her, How know you she is woman, flesh and blood, True clay and mortal lymph, and not a mockery Made up of infernal elements of magic? Canst swear she is no cloud—no subtle ether— No fog, bepainted with deluding dyes— No cheating underplot—no covert shape, Making a filthy masquerade of nature? I say, how know ye this? CURIO. How? by my senses. If I nipped her cheek till it brought the white and red, I wot she is no fog. APOLLONIUS. Fie on the senses! What are the senses but our worst arch-traitors? What is a madman but a king betrayed By the corrupted treason of his senses? His robe a blanket, and his sceptre a straw, His crown his bristled hair. Fie on the shallow senses! What doth swear Such perjuries as the senses?—what give birth To such false rumors and base verdicts render In the very spite of truth? Go to: thy senses Are bond-slaves, both to madness and to magic, And all the mind's disease. I say the senses Deceive thee, though they say a stone's a stone. And thou wilt swear by them an oath, forsooth, And say the outer woman is utter woman, And not a whit a snake! Hark! there's my answer. [Lamia closes the window violently. That noise shall be my comment. GALLO. He talks in riddles, Like a sphinx lapped in a blanket. Gentles—Curio— Let us leave him to his wisdom. APOLLONIUS. Ay, I'll promise 'Twill dive far deeper than your feather wits Into some mysteries. [Going towards the door. CURIO. There's one I know in her house, By name Mercutius, a most savage fellow: I commend ye to his wrath. Exeunt Curio, Gallo, &amp;c. APOLLONIUS. So, get ye gone, Ye unregarded whelps. JULIUS. But will you in, Whether she will or no? APOLLONIUS. Indeed I mean it. Sirrah (to Picus), lead on. I'll charge you with your message. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. A Chamber in Lamia's House. Enter Mercutius in a distracted manner. MERCUTIUS. Where is this haunting witch? Not here! not here!— Why then for a little rest and unlooked calm— Ay, such a calm As the shipmate curses on the stagnate sea Under the torrid zone, that bakes his deck Till it burns the sole of his foot. My purpose idles, But my passions burn without pause; O how this hot And scarlet plague runs boiling through my veins Like a molten lava! I'm all parched up. There's not a shady nook throughout my brain For a quiet thought to lie—no, not a spring Of coolness left in my heart. If I have any name, It is Fever, who is all made up of fire, Of pangs—deliriums—raving ecstacies— And desperate impulse. Ha! a foot!—I know it!— Now then, I'll ambush here, and come upon her Like a wild boar from a thicket. [He hides himself behind an arras: Lamia enters, holding her forehead betwixt her palms. LAMIA. This should be a real head, or 'twould not throb so; Who ever doubts it? I would he had these racking pains within; Ay, and those he hath set in my heart, to drive him mad. How now, sir! Enter Picus. PICUS. There are two below beseech you For a conference. The one's a wrinkled greybeard, The other— LAMIA. You need not name. I will see neither; And tell them—look—with a copy of this frown, If they congregate again beneath my eaves, I have that will hush their twitting. [Exit Picus. Why must I reap These unearned spites where I have sown no hate? Do the jealous gods Stir up these cankered spirits to pursue me? Another! (Mercutius comes forward) What brings thee hither? MERCUTIUS (gloomily). I do not know— If love or hate—indeed I do not know— Or whether a twine of both—they're so entangled. Mayhap to clasp thee to my heart, and kiss thee, To fondle thee, or tear thee, I do not know: Whether I come to die, or work thy death, Whether to be thy tyrant or thy slave, In truth, I do not know. But that some potent yearning draws me to thee, Something, as if those lips were rich and tempting, And worthy of caressing—fondly endeared— And something as if a tortured devil within me Sought revenge of his pangs: I cannot answer Which of these brings me hither. LAMIA. Then prythee hence, Till that be analysed. MERCUTIUS. Ha! ha! turn back: Why if I am a tiger—here's my prey— Or if the milk-mild dove—here is my choice— Do you think I shall turn back howe'er it be? Let the embrace prove which. Nay, do not shrink, If an utter devil press into thy arms, Thyself invoked him! LAMIA. Ah! I know by this Your bent is evil! MERCUTIUS. Then 'twas evil born! As it works 'twas wrought on—look—say what I am, For I have no recognisance of myself. Am I wild beast or man—civil or savage— Reasoning or brutal—or gone utter mad— So am I as thou turned me—hellish or heavenly, The slavish subject of thy influence— I know not what I am—nor how I am, But by thy own enforcement—come to force thee, Being passion-mad. LAMIA. How have I brought thee hither? I would thou wert away! MERCUTIUS. Why dost thou sit, then, I' the middle of a whirlpool drawing me unto thee? My brain is dizzy, and my heart is sick, With the circles I have made round thee and round thee! Till I dash into thy arms! LAMIA. There shalt thou never Go! desperate man; away!—and fear thy gods, Or else the hot indignation in my eyes Will blast thee. O, beware! I have within me A dangerous nature, which, if thou provoke, Acts cruelty. Ne'er chafe me; thou hadst better Ruffle a scorpion than the thing I am! Away! Or I'll bind thy bones till they crack! MERCUTIUS. Ha! ha! dost threaten? Why then come ruin, anguish or death, Being goaded onward by my headlong fate I'll clasp thee!— Though there be sugared venom on thy lips I'll drink it to the dregs—though there be plagues In thy contagious touch—or in thy breath Putrid infections—though thou be more cruel Than lean-ribbed tigers—thirsty and open fanged, I will be as fierce a monster for thy sake, And grapple thee. LAMIA. Would Lycius were here! MERCUTIUS. Ha! would'st thou have him gashed and torn in strips As I would scatter him? then so say I “Would Lycius were here!” I have oft clenched My teeth in that very spite. LAMIA. Thou ruthless devil! To bear him so bloody a will!—Why then, come hither, We are a fit pair. [Mercutius embracing her, she stabs him in the back with a small dagger. MERCUTIUS (falling). O thou false witch! Thou hast pricked me to the heart! Ha! what a film Falls from my eyes!—or have the righteous gods Transformed me to a beast for this! Thou crawling spite, Thou hideous—venomous— [Dies. LAMIA. Let the word choke thee! I know what I am. Thou wilful desperate fool, To charge upon the spikes!—thy death be upon thee!— Why would'st thou have me sting? Heaven knows I had spared thee, But for thy menace of a dearer life. O! Lycius! Lycius! I have been both woman and serpent for thy sake— Perchance to be scorned in each:—I have but gored This ill-starred man in vain!—hush, methought he stirred; I'll give him another thrust (stabs the body); there—lie thou quiet. What a frown he hath upon his face! May the gods ne'er mention it In their thunders, nor set the red stain of his blood For a sign of wrath in the sky!—O thou poor wretch! Not thee, dull clod!—but for myself I weep— The sport of malicious destinies! Why was I heiress of these mortal gifts Perishing all whether I love or hate? Nay, come out of sight [To the body. With thy dismal puckering look—'twill fright the world Out of its happiness. [She drags the body aside, and covers it with drapery. Would I could throw A thicker curtain on thee—but I see thee All through and through, as though I had The eyes of a god within; alas, I fear I am here all human, and have that fierce thing They call a conscience! [Exit. 1829. ON A PICTURE OF HERO AND LEANDER. Why, Lover, why Such a water rover? Would she love thee more For coming half seas over? Why, Lady, why So in love with dipping? Must a lad of Greece Come all over dripping? Why, Cupid, why Make the passage brighter? Were not any boat Better than a lighter? Why, Madam, why So intrusive standing? Must thou be on the stair When he's on the landing? THE FAREWELL. TO A FRENCH AIR. Fare thee well, Gabrielle! Whilst I join France, With bright cuirass and lance! Trumpets swell, Gabrielle! War horses prance, And Cavaliers advance! In the night, Ere the fight, In the night, I'll think of thee! And in pray'r, Lady fair, In thy pray'r, Then think of me! Death may knell, Gabrielle! Where my plumes dance, By arquebuss or lance! Then farewell, Gabrielle! Take my last glance! Fair Miracle of France! THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM. 'Twas in the prime of summer time, An evening calm and cool, And four-and-twenty happy boys Came bounding out of school: There were some that ran and some that leapt, Like troutlets in a pool. Away they sped with gamesome minds, And souls untouch'd by sin; To a level mead they came, and there They drave the wickets in: Pleasantly shone the setting sun Over the town of Lynn. Like sportive deer they coursed about, And shouted as they ran,— Turning to mirth all things of earth, As only boyhood can; But the Usher sat remote from all, A melancholy man! His hat was off, his vest apart, To catch heaven's blessed breeze; For a burning thought was in his brow, And his bosom ill at ease: So he lean'd his head on his hands, and read The book between his knees! Leaf after leaf he turn'd it o'er, Nor ever glanced aside, For the peace of his soul he read that book In the golden eventide: Much study had made him very lean, And pale, and leaden-eyed. At last he shut the ponderous tome, With a fast and fervent grasp He strain'd the dusky covers close, And fix'd the brazen hasp: “Oh, God! could I so close my mind, And clasp it with a clasp!” Then leaping on his feet upright, Some moody turns he took,— Now up the mead, then down the mead, And past a shady nook,— And, lo! he saw a little boy That pored upon a book! “My gentle lad, what is 't you read— Romance or fairy fable? Or is it some historic page, Of kings and crowns unstable?” The young boy gave an upward glance,— “It is ‘The Death of Abel.’” The Usher took six hasty strides, As smit with sudden pain,— Six hasty strides beyond the place, Then slowly back again; And down he sat beside the lad, And talk'd with him of Cain; And, long since then, of bloody men, Whose deeds tradition saves; Of lonely folk cut off unseen, And hid in sudden graves; Of horrid stabs, in groves forlorn, And murders done in caves; And how the sprites of injured men Shriek upward from the sod,— Aye, how the ghostly hand will point To show the burial clod; And unknown facts of guilty acts Are seen in dreams from God! He told how murderers walk the earth Beneath the curse of Cain,— With crimson clouds before their eyes, And flames about their brain: For blood has left upon their souls Its everlasting stain! “And well,” quoth he, “I know, for truth, Their pangs must be extreme,— Woe, woe, unutterable woe,— Who spill life's sacred stream! For why? Methought, last night, I wrought A murder, in a dream! “One that had never done me wrong— A feeble man, and old; I led him to a lonely field,— The moon shone clear and cold: Now here, said I, this man shall die, And I will have his gold! “Two sudden blows with a ragged stick, And one with a heavy stone, One hurried gash with a hasty knife,— And then the deed was done: There was nothing lying at my foot But lifeless flesh and bone! “Nothing but lifeless flesh and bone, That could not do me ill; And yet I fear'd him all the more, For lying there so still: There was a manhood in his look, That murder could not kill! “And, lo! the universal air Seem'd lit with ghastly flame;— Ten thousand thousand dreadful eyes Were looking down in blame: I took the dead man by his hand, And call'd upon his name! “Oh, God! it made me quake to see Such sense within the slain! But when I touch'd the lifeless clay, The blood gush'd out amain! For every clot, a burning spot Was scorching in my brain! “My head was like an ardent coal, My heart as solid ice; My wretched, wretched soul, I knew, Was at the Devil's price: A dozen times I groan'd; the dead Had never groan'd but twice! “And now, from forth the frowning sky, From the Heaven's topmost height, I heard a voice—the awful voice Of the blood-avenging Sprite:— ‘Thou guilty man! take up thy dead And hide it from my sight!’ “I took the dreary body up, And cast it in a stream,— A sluggish water, black as ink, The depth was so extreme:— My gentle Boy, remember this Is nothing but a dream! “Down went the corse with a hollow plunge, And vanish'd in the pool; Anon I cleansed my bloody hands, And wash'd my forehead cool, And sat among the urchins young, That evening in the school. “Oh, Heaven! to think of their white souls, And mine so black and grim! I could not share in childish prayer, Nor join in Evening Hymn: Like a Devil of the Pit I seem'd, 'Mid holy Cherubim! “And peace went with them, one and all, And each calm pillow spread; But Guilt was my grim Chamberlain That lighted me to bed; And drew my midnight curtains round, With fingers bloody red! “All night I lay in agony, In anguish dark and deep; My fever'd eyes I dared not close, But stared aghast at Sleep: For Sin had render'd unto her The keys of Hell to Keep! “All night I lay in agony, From weary chime to chime, With one besetting horrid hint, That rack'd me all the time; A mighty yearning, like the first Fierce impulse unto crime! “One stern tyrannic thought, that made All other thoughts its slave; Stronger and stronger every pulse Did that temptation crave,— Still urging me to go and see The Dead Man in his grave! “Heavily I rose up, as soon As light was in the sky, And sought the black accursed pool With a wild misgiving eye; And I saw the Dead in the river bed, For the faithless stream was dry. “Merrily rose the lark, and shook The dew-drop from its wing; But I never mark'd its morning flight, I never heard it sing: For I was stooping once again Under the horrid thing. “With breathless speed, like a soul in chase, I took him up and ran;— There was no time to dig a grave Before the day began: In a lonesome wood, with heaps of leaves I hid the murder'd man! “And all that day I read in school, But my thought was other where; As soon as the mid-day task was done, In secret I was there: And a mighty wind had swept the leaves, And still the corse was bare! “Then down I cast me on my face, And first began to weep, For I knew my secret then was one That earth refused to keep: Or land or sea, though he should be Ten thousand fathoms deep. “So wills the fierce avenging Sprite, Till blood for blood atones! Ay, though he's buried in a cave, And trodden down with stones, And years have rotted off his flesh,— The world shall see his bones! “Oh, God! that horrid, horrid dream Besets me now awake! Again—again, with dizzy brain, The human life I take; And my red right hand grows raging hot, Like Cranmer's at the stake. “And still no peace for the restless clay, Will wave or mould allow; The horrid thing pursues my soul,— It stands before me now!” The fearful Boy look'd up, and saw Huge drops upon his brow. That very night, while gentle sleep The urchin eyelids kiss'd, Two stern-faced men set out from Lynn, Through the cold and heavy mist; And Eugene Aram walk'd between, With gyves upon his wrist. THE EPPING HUNT. “HUNT'S ROASTED ?.” “On Monday they began to hunt.” —Chevy Chase. John Huggins was as bold a man As trade did ever know; A warehouse good he had, that stood Hard by the church of Bow. There people bought Dutch cheeses round And single Glos'ter flat; And English butter in a lump, And Irish—in a pat. Six days a week beheld him stand, His business next his heart, At counter, with his apron tied About his counter-part. The seventh, in a Sluice-house box He took his pipe and pot; On Sundays, for eel-piety, A very noted spot. Ah, blest if he had never gone Beyond its rural shed! One Easter-tide, some evil guide Put Epping in his head! Epping, for butter justly famed, And pork in sausage popp'd; Where, winter time or summer time, Pig's flesh is always chopp'd. But famous more, as annals tell, Because of Easter chase; There every year, 'twixt dog and deer, There is a gallant race. With Monday's sun John Huggins rose, And slapped his leather thigh, And sang the burden of the song, “This day a stag must die.” For all the live-long day before, And all the night in bed, Like Beckford, he had nourished “Thoughts On Hunting” in his head. Of horn and morn, and hark and bark, And echo's answering sounds, All poets' wit hath every writ In dog-rel verse of hounds. Alas! there was no warning voice To whisper in his ear, Thou art a fool in leaving Cheap To go and hunt the deer! No thought he had of twisted spine, Or broken arms or legs; Not chicken-hearted he, although 'Twas whispered of his eggs! Ride out he would, and hunt he would, Nor dreamt of ending ill; Mayhap with Dr. Ridout's fee, And Surgeon Hunter's bill. So he drew on his Sunday boots, Of lustre superfine; The liquid black they wore that day Was Warren-ted to shine. His yellow buckskins fitted close, As erst upon a stag; Thus well equipped he gayly skipped, At once upon his nag. But first to him that held the rein A crown he nimbly flung; For holding of the horse?—why, no— For holding of his tongue. To say the horse was Huggins' own Would only be a brag; His neighbour Fig and he went halves, Like Centaurs, in a nag. And he that day had got the gray, Unknown to brother cit; The horse he knew would never tell, Although it was a tit. A well-bred horse he was, I wis, As he began to show, By quickly “rearing up within The way he ought to go.” But Huggins, like a wary man, Was ne'er from saddle cast; Resolved, by going very slow, On sitting very fast. And so he jogged to Tot'n'am Cross, An ancient town well known, Where Edward wept for Eleanor In mortar and in stone. A royal game of fox and goose, To play on such a loss; Wherever she set down her orts, Thereby he put a cross. Now Huggins had a crony here, That lived beside the way; One that had promised sure to be His comrade for the day. Whereas the man had changed his mind Meanwhile upon the case! And meaning not to hunt at all, Had gone to Enfield Chase! For why, his spouse had made him vow To let a game alone, Where folks that ride a bit of blood May break a bit of bone. “Now, be his wife a plague for life! A coward sure is he!” Then Huggins turned his horse's head, And crossed the bridge of Lea, Thence slowly on through Laytonstone, Past many a Quaker's box— No Friends to hunters after deer, Though followers of a Fox. And many a score behind—before— The self-same rout inclined; And, minded all to march one way, Made one great march of mind. Gentle and simple, he and she, And swell, and blood, and prig; And some had carts, and some a chaise, According to their gig. Some long-eared jacks, some knacker's hacks (However odd it sounds), Let out that day to hunt, instead Of going to the hounds! And some had horses of their own, And some where forced to job it: And some, while they inclined to Hunt, Betook themselves to Cob-it. All sorts of vehicles and vans, Bad, middling, and the smart; Here rolled along the gay barouche, And there a dirty cart! And lo! a cart that held a squad Of costermonger line; With one poor hack, like Pegasus, That slaved for all the Nine! Yet marvel not at any load That any horse might drag; When all, that morn, at once were drawn Together by a stag. Now when they saw John Huggins go At such a sober pace; “Hallo!” cried they; “come, trot away, You'll never see the chase!” But John, as grave as any judge, Made answer quite as blunt; “It will be time enough to trot, When I begin to hunt!” And so he paced to Woodford Wells, Where many a horseman met, And letting go the reins, of course, Prepared for heavy wet. And lo! within the crowded door, Stood Rounding, jovial elf; Here shall the Muse frame no excuse, But frame the man himself. A snow-white head, a merry eye, A cheek of jolly blush; A claret tint laid on by health, With master Reynard's brush; A hearty frame, a courteous bow, The prince he learned it from; His age about threescore and ten, And there you have Old Tom. In merriest key I trow was he, So many guests to boast; So certain congregations meet, And elevate the host. “Now welcome lads,” quoth he, “and prads, You're all in glorious luck: Old Robin has a run to-day, A noted forest buck. Fair Mead's the place, where Bob and Tom, In red already ride; 'Tis but a step, and on a horse, You soon may go a-stride.” So off they scampered, man and horse, As time and temper pressed— But Huggins, hitching on a tree, Branched off from all the rest. Howbeit he tumbled down in time To join with Tom and Bob, All in Fair Mead, which held that day Its own fair meed of mob. Idlers to wit—no Guardians some, Of Tattlers in a squeeze; Ramblers in heavy carts and vans, Spectators up in trees. Butchers on backs of butchers' hacks, That shambled to and fro! Bakers intent upon a buck, Neglectful of the dough! Change Alley Bears to speculate, As usual for a fall; And green and scarlet runners, such As never climbed a wall! 'Twas strange to think what difference A single creature made; A single stag had caused a whole Stagnation in their trade. Now Huggins from his saddle rose, And in the stirrups stood; And lo! a little cart that came Hard by a little wood. In shape like half a hearse—though not For corpses in the least; For this contained the deer alive, And not the dear deceased! And now began a sudden stir, And then a sudden shout, The prison doors were opened wide, And Robin bounded out! His antlered head shone blue and red, Bedecked with ribbons fine; Like other bucks that comes to 'list The hawbucks in the line. One curious gaze of mild amaze, He turned and shortly took: Then gently ran adown the mead, And bounded o'er the brook. Now Huggins, standing far aloof, Had never seen the deer, Till all at once he saw the beast Come charging in his rear. Away he went, and many a score Of riders did the same, On horse and ass—like High and Low And Jack pursuing Game! Good Lord! to see the riders now, Thrown off with sudden whirl, A score within the purling brook, Enjoyed their “early purl.” A score were sprawling on the grass, And beavers fell in showers; There was another Floorer there, Beside the Queen of Flowers! Some lost their stirrups, some their whips, Some had no caps to show: But few, like Charles at Charing Cross, Rode on in Statue quo. “O dear! O dear!” now might you hear, “I've surely broke a bone;” “My head is sore”—with many more Such Speeches from the Thrown. Howbeit their wailings never moved The wide Satanic clan, Who grinned, as once the Devil grinned, To see the fall of Man. And hunters good, that understood, Their laughter knew no bounds, To see the horses “throwing off” So long before the hounds. For deer must have due course of law, Like men the Courts among; Before those Barristers the dogs Proceed to “giving tongue.” But now Old Robin's foes were set That fatal taint to find, That always is scent after him, Yet always left behind. And here observe how dog and man A different temper shows: What hound resents that he is sent To follow his own nose? Towler and Jowler—howlers all, No single tongue was mute; The stag had led a hart, and lo! The whole pack followed suit. No spur he lacked; fear stuck a knife And fork in either haunch; And every dog he knew had got An eye-tooth to his paunch! Away, away! he scudded like A ship before the gale; Now flew to “hills we know not of,” Now, nun-like, took the vale. Another squadron charging now, Went off at furious pitch;— A perfect Tam O'Shanter mob, Without a single witch. But who was he with flying skirts, A hunter did endorse, And, like a poet, seemed to ride Upon a wingèd horse? A whipper-in? no whipper in: A huntsman? no such soul: A connoisseur, or amateur? Why, yes—a horse patrol. A member of police, for whom The county found a nag, And, like Acteon in the tale, He found himself in stag! Away they went, then, dog and deer, And hunters all away; The maddest horses never knew Mad staggers such as they! Some gave a shout, some rolled about, And anticked as they rode; And butchers whistled on their curs, And milkmen tally-ho'd! About two score there were, or more, That galloped in the race; The rest, alas! lay on the grass, As once in Chevy Chase! But even those that galloped on Were fewer every minute; The field kept getting more select, Each thicket served to thin it. For some pulled up, and left the hunt Some fell in miry bogs, And vainly rose and “ran a muck,” To overtake the dogs. And some, in charging hurdle stakes, Were left bereft of sense; What else could be premised of blades That never learned to fence? But Roundings, Tom and Bob, no gate, Nor hedge, nor ditch could stay; O'er all they went, and did the work Of leap-years in a day! And by their side see Huggins ride, As fast as he could speed; For, like Mazeppa, he was quite At mercy of his steed. No means he had, by timely check, The gallop to remit, For firm and fast, between his teeth, The biter held the bit. Trees raced along, all Essex fled Beneath him as he sate; He never saw a county go At such a county rate! “Hold hard! hold hard! you'll lame the dogs!” Quoth Huggins, “so I do; I've got the saddle well in hand, And hold as hard as you!” Good Lord! to see him ride along, And throw his arms about, As if with stitches in the side That he was drawing out! And now he bounded up and down, Now like a jelly shook; Till bumped and galled—yet not where Gall For bumps did ever look! And rowing with his legs the while, As tars are apt to ride; With every kick he gave a prick Deep in the horse's side! But soon the horse was well avenged For cruel smart of spurs, For, riding through a moor, he pitched His master in a furze! Where, sharper set than hunger is, He squatted all forlorn; And, like a bird, was singing out While sitting on a thorn! Right glad was he, as well might be, Such cushion to resign: “Possession is nine points,” but his Seems more than ninety-nine. Yet worse than all the prickly points That entered in his skin, His nag was running off the while The thorns were running in! Now had a Papist seen his sport, Thus laid upon the shelf, Although no horse he had to cross, He might have crossed himself. Yet surely still the wind is ill That none can say is fair; A jolly wight there was, that rode Upon a sorry mare! A sorry mare, that surely came Of pagan blood and bone; For down upon her knees she went To many a stock and stone! Now seeing Huggins' nag adrift, This farmer, shrewd and sage, Resolved, by changing horses here, To hunt another stage! Though felony, yet who would let Another's horse alone, Whose neck is placed in jeopardy By riding on his own? And yet the conduct of the man Seemed honest-like and fair; For he seemed willing, horse and all, To go before the mare! So up on Huggins' horse he got, And swiftly rode away, While Huggins mounted on the mare Done brown upon a bay! And off they set in double chase, For such was fortune's whim, The farmer rode to hunt the stag, And Huggins hunted him! Alas! with one that rode so well In vain it was to strive; A dab was he, as dabs should be— All leaping and alive! And here of Nature's kindly care Behold a curious proof, As nags are meant to leap, she puts A frog in every hoof! Whereas the mare, although her share She had of hoof and frog, On coming to a gate stopped short As stiff as any log; While Huggins in the stirrup stood With neck like neck of crane, As sings the Scottish song—“to see The gate his hart had gane.” And, lo! the dim and distant hunt Diminished in a trice: The steeds, like Cinderella's team, Seemed dwindling into mice; And, far remote, each scarlet coat Soon flitted like a spark— Though still the forest murmured back An echo of the bark! But sad at soul John Huggins turned: No comfort could he find; While thus the “Hunting Chorus” sped, To stay five bars behind. For though by dint of spur he got A leap in spite of fate— Howbeit there was no toll at all— They could not clear the gate. And, like Fitzjames, he cursed the hunt, And sorely cursed the day, And mused a new Gray's elegy On his departed gray. Now many a sign at Woodford town Its Inn-vitation tells: But Huggins, full of ills, of course Betook him to the Wells, Where Rounding tried to cheer him up With many a merry laugh: But Huggins thought of neighbour Fig, And called for half-and-half. Yet, spite of drink, he could not blink Remembrance of his loss; To drown a care like his, required Enough to drown a horse. When thus forlorn, a merry horn Struck up without the door— The mounted mob were all returned; The Epping Hunt was o'er! And many a horse was taken out Of saddle, and of shaft; And men, by dint of drink, became The only “beasts of draught.” For now begun a harder run On wine, and gin, and beer; And overtaken men discussed The overtaken deer. How far he ran, and eke how fast, And how at bay he stood, Deerlike, resolved to sell his life As dearly as he could:— And how the hunters stood aloof, Regardful of their lives, And shunned a beast, whose very horns They knew could handle knives! How Huggins stood when he was rubbed By help and ostler kind, And when they cleaned the clay before, How worse “remained behind.” And one, how he had found a horse Adrift—a goodly gray! And kindly rode the nag, for fear The nag should go astray; Now Huggins, when he heard the tale, Jumped up with sudden glee; “A goodly gray! why, then, I say, That gray belongs to me! “Let me endorse again my horse, Delivered safe and sound; And gladly I will give the man A bottle and a pound!” The wine was drunk—the money paid, Though not without remorse, To pay another man so much For riding on his horse;— And let the chase again take place For many a long, long year— John Huggins will not ride again To hunt the Epping Deer! MORAL. Thus Pleasure oft eludes our grasp Just when we think to grip her; And hunting after Happiness, We only hunt a slipper. THE SHIP LAUNCH. SUNG BY MR. MATHEWS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT CALLED “THE SPRING MEETING.” WORDS BY THOMAS HOOD, ESQ. MUSIC BY S. BLEWITT. The day is bright, the wind is light, And gay with flags and streamers; From side to side old Thames's tide Is mobb'd with boats and steamers. Put up, my dear, the bottled beer, And pack the mutton haunch now; Then off we go, row, brothers, row, And let us see the launch now. GOG AND MAGOG. A GUILDHALL DUET. MAGOG. Why, Gog, I say, it's after One, And yet no dinner carved; Shall we endure this sort of fun, And stand here to be starved? GOG. I really think our City Lords Must be a shabby set; I've stood here since King Charles's time, And had no dinner yet! MAGOG. I vow I can no longer stay; I say, are we to dine to-day? GOG. My hunger would provoke a saint, I've waited till I'm sick and faint; I'll tell you what, they'll starve us both, I'll tell you what, they'll stop our growth. MAGOG. I wish I had a round of beef My hungry tooth to charm; I've wind enough in my inside To play the Hundredth Psalm. GOG. And yet they feast beneath our eyes Without the least remorse; This very week I saw the Mayor A feeding like a horse! MAGOG. Such loads of fish, and flesh, and fowl, To think upon it makes me growl! GOG. I wonder where the fools were taught, That they should keep a giant short! They'll stop our growth, they'll stop our growth; They'll starve us both, they'll starve us both! MAGOG. They said, a hundred years ago, That we should dine at One; Why, Gog, I say, our meat by this Is rather over-done. GOG. I do not want it done at all, So hungry is my maw, Give me an Alderman in chains, And I will eat him raw! MAGOG. Of starving weavers they discuss, And yet they never think of us. I say, are we to dine to-day; Are we to dine to-day? GOG. Oh dear, the pang it is to feel So mealy-mouthed without a meal! MAGOG. I'll tell you what, they'll stop our growth! GOG. I'll tell you what, they'll starve us both! BOTH. They'll stop our growth, they'll starve us both! VALENTINE'S DAY. Surely the mornin' Cupid was born in Ought to be kept, 'tis Valentine's day, Father and Mother, Sister and Brother; This, that and t'other may preach as they may, But nothing shall hinder a peep at the winder To see if the Postman is over the way. THE LORD MAYOR'S SHOW. SUNG BY MR. MATHEWS FOR THE SPRING MEETING. [[1.]] How well I remember the ninth of November, The sky very foggy, the Sun looking groggy, In fact, altogether pea-soup coloured weather. Shop-windows all shuttered, the pavement all buttered, Policemen paraded, the street barricaded, And a peal from the steeple of Bow! Low women in pattens, high ladies in satins, And Cousin Suburbans, in flame-coloured turbans, Quite up to the attics, inviting rheumatics, A great mob collecting, without much selecting, And some, it's a pity, are free of the City, As your pockets may happen to know! Such hustle and bustle, and mobbing and robbing, All, all to see the Lord Mayor's Show! 2. How well I remember the ninth of November, Six trumpets on duty, as shrill as Veluti, A great City Marshal, to riding not partial, The footmen, the state ones, with calves very great ones, The Cook and the Scullion, well basted with bullion, And the squad of each Corporate Co. Four draymen from Perkins, in steel and brass jerkins, A Coach like a lantern, I wonder it can turn, All carved like old buildings, and drawn by six gildings, With two chubby faces, where sword and where mace is, The late Mayor, the Ex one, a thought that must vex one, And the new Mayor just come into blow! Such hustle and bustle, and mobbing and robbing, All, all to see the Lord Mayor's Show! 3. How well I remember the ninth of November, The fine Lady Mayoress, an Ostrich's heiress, In best bib and tucker, and dignified pucker, The learned Recorder, in Old Bailey order, The Sheriffs together,—with their hanging weather, And their heads like John Anderson's pow! The Alderman courtly, and looking 'red port'ly, And buckler and bargemen, with other great large men, With streamers and banners, held up in odd manners, A mob running “arter,” to see it by “vater,” And the Wharfs popping off as they go! Such hustle and bustle, and mobbing and robbing, All, all to see the Lord Mayor's Show! LIEUTENANT LUFF. A COMIC BALLAD. All you that are too fond of wine, Or any other stuff, Take warning by the dismal fate Of one Lieutenant Luff. A sober man he might have been, Except in one regard, He did not like soft water, So he took to drinking hard! Said he, “Let others fancy slops, And talk in praise of Tea, But I am no Bohemian, So do not like Bohea. If wine's a poison, so is Tea, Though in another shape; What matter whether one is kill'd By canister or grape!” According to this kind of taste Did he indulge his drouth, And being fond of Port, he made A port-hole of his mouth! A single pint he might have sipp'd And not been out of sorts, In geologic phrase—the rock He split upon was quarts! To “hold the mirror up to vice” With him was hard, alas! The worse for wine he often was, But not “before a glass.” No kind and prudent friend had he To bid him drink no more,— The only chequers in his course Were at a tavern door! Full soon the sad effects of this His frame began to show, For that old enemy the gout Had taken him in toe! And join'd with this an evil came Of quite another sort,— For while he drank, himself, his purse Was getting “something short.” For want of cash he soon had pawn'd One half that he possess'd, And drinking show'd him duplicates Beforehand of the rest! So now his creditors resolved To seize on his assets; For why,—they found that his half-pay Did not half-pay his debts. But Luff contrived a novel mode His Creditors to chouse; For his own execution he Put into his own house! A pistol to the muzzle charged He took devoid of fear; Said he, “This barrel is my last, So now for my last bier!” Against his lungs he aimed the slugs, And not against his brain, So he blew out his lights—and none Could blow them in again! A Jury for a Verdict met And gave it in these terms:— “We find as how as certain slugs Has sent him to the worms!” LOVE HAS NOT EYES. Of all the poor old Tobits a-groping in the street, A Lover is the blindest that ever I did meet, For he's blind, he's blind, he's very blind,— He's as blind as any mole! He thinks his love the fairest that ever yet was clasp'd, Though her clay is overbaked, and it never has been rasp'd. For he's blind, &amp;c. He thinks her face an angel's, although it's quite a frump's, Like a toad a-taking physic, or a monkey in the mumps. For he's blind, &amp;c. Upon her graceful figure then how he will insist, Though she's all so much awry, she can only eat a twist! For he's blind, &amp;c. He'll swear that in her dancing she cuts all others out, Though like a Gal that's galvanised, she throws her legs about. For he's blind, &amp;c. If he should have a letter in answer to his sighs, He'll put it to his lips up, instead of to his eyes. For he's blind, &amp;c. Then if he has a meeting the question for to put, In suing for her hand he'll be kneeling at her foot. For he's blind, &amp;c. Oh Love is like a furnace wherein a Lover lies, And like a pig before the fire, he scorches out his eyes. Till he's blind, &amp;c. SONG. [My mother bids me spend my smiles] Air—“My mother bids me.” My mother bids me spend my smiles On all who come and call me fair, As crumbs are thrown upon the tiles, To all the sparrows of the air. But I've a darling of my own For whom I hoard my little stock— What if I chirp him all alone, And leave mamma to feed the flock! SONNET FOR THE 14TH OF FEBRUARY. No popular respect will I omit To do thee honour on this happy day, When every loyal lover tasks his wit His simple truth in studious rhymes to pay, And to his mistress dear his hopes convey. Rather thou knowest I would still outrun All calendars with Love's,—whose date alway Thy bright eyes govern better than the Sun,— For with thy favour was my life begun; And still I reckon on from smiles to smiles, And not by summers, for I thrive on none But those thy cheerful countenance compiles: Oh! if it be to choose and call thee mine, Love, thou art every day my Valentine. A BUNCH OF FORGET-ME-NOTS. Forget me not! It is the cry of clay, From infancy to age, from ripe to rotten; For who, “to dumb forgetfulness a prey,” Would be forgotten? Hark the poor infant, in the age of pap, A little Laplander on nurse's lap, Some strange, neglectful, gossiping old Trot, Meanwhile on dull Oblivion's lap she lieth, In her shrill Baby-lonish language crieth— What? “Forget me not!” The schoolboy writes unto the self-same tune, The yearly letter, guiltless of a blot, “We break up on the twenty-third of June;” And then, with comps. from Dr. Polyglot, “P.S. Forget me not!” When last my elder brother sailed for Quito, My chalky foot had in a hobble got— Why did he plant his timber toe on my toe, To stamp on memory's most tender spot “Forget me not!” The dying nabob, on whose shrivelled skin The Indian “mulliga” has left its “tawny,” Leaving life's pilgrimage so rough and thorny, Bindeth his kin Two tons of sculptured marble to allot— A small “Forget me not!” The hardy sailor parting from his wives, Sharing among them all that he has got, Keeps a fond eye upon their after-lives, And says to seventeen—“If I am shot, Forget me not.” Why, all the mob of authors that now trouble The world with cold-pressed volumes and with hot, They all are seeking reputation's bubble, Hopelessly hoping, like Sir Walter Scott, To tie in fame's own handkerchief a double Forget-me-knot! A past past tense, In fact, is sought for by all human kind, And hence Our common Irish wish—to leave ourselves behind. Forget me not!—It is the common chorus Swell'd by all those behind and before us; Each fifth of each November Calls out “Remember!” And even a poor man of straw will try To live by dint of powder and of plot. In short, it is the cry of every Guy— “Forget me not!” WRITTEN IN A YOUNG LADY'S ALBUM. A pretty task, Miss S?, to ask A Benedictine pen, That cannot quite at freedom write Like those of other men. No lover's plaint my Muse must paint To fill this page's span, But be correct and recollect I'm not a single man Pray only think for pen and ink How hard to get along, That may not turn on words that burn Or Love, the life of song! Nine Muses, if I chooses, I May woo all in a clan, But one Miss S? I daren't address— I'm not a single man. Scribblers unwed, with little head May eke it out with heart, And in their lays it often plays A rare first-fiddle part. They make a kiss to rhyme with bliss, But if I so began, I have my fears about my ears— I'm not a single man. Upon your cheek I may not speak, Nor on your lip be warm, I must be wise about your eyes, And formal with your form, Of all that sort of thing, in short, On T. H. Bayly's plan, I must not twine a single line— I'm not a single man. A watchman's part compels my heart To keep you off its beat, And I might dare as soon to swear At you as at your feet. I can't expire in passion's fire As other poets can— My life (she's by) won't let me die— I'm not a single man. Shut out from love, denied a dove, Forbidden bow and dart, Without a groan to call my own, With neither hand nor heart, To Hymen vow'd, and not allow'd To flirt e'en with your fan, Here end, as just a friend, I must— I'm not a single man. 1831. SONNET. [Time was I liked a cheesecake well enough—] “Sweets to the sweet—farewell.” —Hamlet. Time was I liked a cheesecake well enough— All human children have a sweetish taste; I used to revel in a pie, or puff, Or tart—we all were Tartars in our youth; To meet with jam or jelly was good luck, All candies most complacently I crumped, A stick of liquorice was good to suck, And sugar was as often liked as lumped! On treacle's “linkèd sweetness long drawn out,” Or honey I could feast like any fly; I thrilled when lollipops were hawked about; How pleased to compass hard-bake or bull's-eye; How charmed if Fortune in my power cast Elecampane—but that campaign is past. THE PAINTER PUZZLED. “Draw, Sir!” —Old Play. Well, something must be done for May, The time is drawing nigh, To figure in the catalogue And woo the public eye. Something I must invent and paint; But, oh! my wit is not Like one of those kind substantives That answer Who and What? Oh, for some happy hit! to throw The gazer in a trance: But posé là—there I am posed, As people say in France. In vain I sit and strive to think, I find my head, alack! Painfully empty, still, just like A bottle “on the rack.” In vain I task my barren brain Some new idea to catch, And tease my hair—ideas are shy Of “coming to the scratch.” In vain I stare upon the air, No mental visions dawn; A blank my canvas still remains, And worse—a blank undrawn: An “aching void” that mars my rest With one eternal hint, For, like the little goblin page, It still keeps crying “Tint!” But what to tint? ay, there's the rub, That plagues me all the while, As, Selkirk-like, I sit without A subject for my i'le. “Invention's seventh heaven” the bard Has written—but my case Persuades me that the creature dwells In quite another place. Sniffing the lamp, the ancients thought Demosthenes must toil; But works of art are works indeed, And always “smell of oil.” Yet painting pictures, some folks think, Is merely play and fun; That what is on an easel set Must easily be done. But, zounds! if they could sit in this Uneasy easy-chair, They'd very soon be glad enough To cut the Camel's hair. Oh! who can tell the pang it is To sit as I this day— With all my canvas spread, and yet Without an inch of way. Till, mad at last to find I am Amongst such empty skullers, I feel that I could strike myself But no—I'll “strike my colours.” TO MR. WRENCH AT THE ENGLISH OPERA HOUSE. Oh very pleasant Mr. Wrench,— The first, upon the pit's first bench, I've scrambled to my place, To hail thee on these summer boards With joy, even critic-craft affords, And watch thy welcome face! Ere thou art come, how I rejoice To hear thy free and easy voice, Lounging about the slips; And then thy figure comes and owns The voice as careless as the tones That saunter from thy lips. Oh come and cast a quiet glance, To glad a nameless friend, askance The lamps' ascending glare; Better it is than bended knees, Heart-squeezing, and profound congés— That old familiar air. Even in the street, in that apt face, Full of gay gravity, I trace The soul of native whim; A constant, never-failing store Of quiet mirth, that ne'er runs o'er, But ay is near the brim. Quoth I, “There goes a happy wight, Inimical to spleen and spite, And careless of all care; Who oils the ruffled waves of strife, And makes the work-day suit of life Of very easy wear. Lord! if he had some people's ills To cope—their hungry bonds and bills, How faintly they would tease; Things that have cost both tears and sighs— Their foes, as motelings in his eyes— Their duns, his summer fleas! The stage, I guess, is not thy school— Thou dost not antic like the fool That wept behind his mask; Thy playing is thy play—a sport— A revel, as perform'd at Court, And not a trade—a task! Gay Freeman, art thou hired for him? No—'tis thy humour and thy whim To be that easy guest; Whereas whoever plays for pelf, (Like Bennett) only gives him-self, Or her—like Mrs. West! Nay, thou—to look beyond the stage, Thy life is but another page Continued of the play; The same companionable sprite— Thy whim and pleasantry by night Are with thee in the day! 1832. ODE TO N. A. VIGORS, ESQ. ON THE PUBLICATION OF “THE GARDENS AND MENAGERIE OF THE ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY.” “Give you good den.” —Shakespeare. So Mr. V.,—no Vigors—I beg pardon— You've published your Zoological Garden! A book of which I've heard a deal of talk, And your Menagerie—indeed, 'tis too bad o' me, But I have never seen your Beast Academy! Or set my feet In Brute-on Street, Or ever wandered in your “Bird-cage Walk.” Yet, I believe that you were truly born To be a kind of brutal overseer, And, like the royal quarterings, appear Between a lion and a unicorn: There is a sort of reason about rhyme That I have pondered many, many a time; Where words, like birds of feather, Likely to come together, Are quite prophetically made to chime; So your own office is forestalled, O Vigors! Your proper Surname having but one single Appropriate jingle, ? Tigers! Where is your gardening volume? like old Mawe's! Containing rules for cultivating brutes, Like fruits. Through April, May, or June, As thus—now rake your Lions' manes, and prune Your Tigers' claws; About the middle of the month, if fair, Give your Chameleons air; Choose shady walls for Owls, Water your Fowls, And plant your Leopards in the sunniest spots; Earth up your Beavers; train your Bears to climb; Thin out your Elephants about this time; And set some early Kangaroos in pots. In some warm sheltered place, Prepare a hot-bed for the Boa race, Leaving them room to swell; Prick out your Porcupines; and blanch your Ermine; Stick up Opossums; trim your Monkeys well; And “destroy all vermin.” Oh, tell me, Mr. Vigors! for the fleas Of curiosity begin to tease— If they bite rudely I must crave your pardon, But if a man may ask, What is the task You have to do in this exotic garden? If from your title one may guess your ends, You are a sort of Secretary Bird To write home word From ignorant brute beasts to absent friends. Does ever the poor little Coati Mundi Beg you to write to ma' To ask papa To send him a new suit to wear on Sunday? Does Mrs. L. request you'll be so good —Acting a sort of Urban to Sylvanus— As write to her “two children in the wood,” Addressed—post-paid—to Leo Africanus? Does ever the great Sea-Bear Londinensis Make you amanuensis To send out news to some old Arctic stager— “Pray write that Brother Bruin, on the whole, Has got a head on this day's pole, And say my Ursa has been made a Major?” Do you not write dejected letters—very— Describing England for poor “Happy Jerry,” Unlike those emigrants who take in flats, Throwing out New South Wales for catching sprats? Of course your penmanship you ne'er refuse For “begging letters” from poor Kangaroos; Of course you manage bills and their acquittance, And sometimes pen for Pelican a double Letter to Mrs. P., and brood in trouble. Enclosing a small dab, as a remittance; Or send from Mrs. B. to her old cadger, Her full-length, done by Harvey, that rare draughtsman And skilful craftsman, A game one too, for he can draw a Badger. Does Doctor Bennett never come and trouble you To break the death of Wolf to Mrs. W.? To say poor Buffalo his last has puffed, And died quite suddenly, without a will, Soothing the widow with a tender quill, And gently hinting—“would she like him stuffed?’ Does no old sentimental Monkey weary Your hand at times to vent his scribbling itch? And then your pen must answer to the query Of Dame Giraffe, who has been told her deary Died on the spot—and wishes to know which? New candidates meanwhile your help are waiting— To fill up cards of thanks, with due refinement, For Missis 'Possum, after her confinement; To pen a note of pretty Poll's dictating— Or write how Charles the Tenth's departed reign Disquiets the crowned Crane, And all the royal Tigers; To send a bulletin to brother Asses Of Zebra's health, what sort of night he passes;— Is this your duty, Secretary Vigors? Or are your brutes but Garden-brutes indeed, Of the old shrubby breed, Dragons of holly—Peacocks cut in yew? But no—I've seen your book, And all the creatures look Like real creatures, natural and true! Ready to prowl, to growl, to prey, to fight, Thanks be to Harvey who their portraits drew, And to the cutters praise is justly due, To Branston always, and to always Wright. Go on then, publishing your monthly parts, And let the wealthy crowd, The noble and the proud, Learn of brute beasts to patronise the Arts. So may your Household flourish in the Park, And no long Boa go to his long home, No Antelope give up the vital spark, But all with this your scientific tome, Go on as swimmingly as old Noah's Ark! ODE TO JOSEPH HUME, ESQ., M.P. “I lisped in numbers, for the numbers came.” Oh, Mr. Hume, thy name Is travelling post upon the road to fame, With four fast horses and two sharp postilions; Thy reputation Has friends by numeration, Units, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Millions. Whenever public men together dine, They drink to thee With three times three— That's nine. And oft a votary proposes then To add unto the cheering one cheer more— Nine and One are Ten; Or somebody, for thy honour still more keen, Insists on four times four— Sixteen! In Parliament no star shines more or bigger, And yet thou dost not care to cut a figure; Equally art thou eloquent and able, Whether in showing how to serve the nation Or laying its petitions on the Table Of Multiplication. In motion thou art second unto none, Though fortune on thy motions seems to frown, For though you set a number down You seldom carry one. Great at speech thou art, though some folks cough, But thou art greatest at a paring off. But never blench, Although in stirring up corruption's worms You make some factions Vulgar as certain fractions, Almost reduced unto their lowest terms. Go on, reform, diminish, and retrench; Go on, for ridicule not caring; Sift on from one to nine with all their noughts, And make state cyphers eat up their own orts, And only in thy saving be unsparing; At soldiers' uniforms make awful rackets, Don't trim though, but untrim their jackets. Allow the tin mines no tin tax, Cut off the Great Seal's wax! Dock all the dock-yards, lower masts and sails, Search foot by foot the Infantry's amounts, Look into all the Cavalry's accounts, And crop their horses' tails. Look well to Woolwich and each Money-vote, Examine all the cannons' charges well, And those who found th' Artillery compel To forge twelve-pounders for a five-pound note. Watch Sandhurst too, its debts and its Cadets— Those Military pets. Take Army—no, take Leggy Tailors Down to the Fleet, for no one but a nincum Out of our nations narrow income Would furnish such wide trousers to the Sailors. Next take, to wonder him, The Master of the Horse's horse from under him; Retrench from those who tend on Royal ills Wherewith to gild their pills. And tell the Stag-hound's Master he must keep The deer, &amp;c., cheap. Close as new brooms Scrub the Bed Chamber Grooms; Abridge the Master of the Ceremonies Of his very moneys; In short, at every salary have a pull, And when folks come for pay On quarter-day, Stop half and make them give receipts in full. Oh, Mr. Hume, don't drink, Or eat, or sleep, a wink, Till you have argued over each reduction: Let it be food to you, repose and suction; Though you should make more motions by one half Than any telegraph, Item by item all these things enforce, Be on your legs till lame, and talk till hoarse; Have lozenges—mind, Dawson's—in your pocket, And swing your arms till aching in their socket; Or if awake you cannot keep, Talk of retrenchment in your sleep; Expose each Peachum, and show up each Lockit— Go down to the M.P.'s before you sup, And while they're sitting blow them up, As Guy Fawkes could not do with all his nous; But now we live in different Novembers, And safely you may walk into the House, First split its ears and then divide its members! JARVIS AND MRS. COPE. A DECIDEDLY SERIOUS BALLAD. In Bunhill Row, some years ago, There lived one Mrs. Cope; A pious woman she was call'd, As Pius as a Pope. Not pious in its proper sense, But chatt'ring like a bird Of sin and grace—in such a case Mag-piety's the word. Cries she, “The Reverend Mr. Trigg This day a text will broach, And much I long to hear him preach, So, Betty, call a coach.” A bargain though she wish'd to make, Ere they began to jog— “Now, Coachman, what d'ye take me for?” Says Coachman, “for a hog.” But Jarvis, when he set her down, A second hog did lack— Whereas she only offered him One shilling and “a track.” Said he, “There ain't no tracks in Quaife, You and your tracks be both—” And, affidavit-like, he clench'd Her shilling with an oath. Said she, “I'll have you fined for this, And soon it shall be done, I'll have you up at Worship Street, You wicked one, naught one!” And sure enough at Worship Street That Friday week they stood; She said bad language he had used, And thus she “made it good.” “He said two shilling was his fare, And wouldn't take no less— I said one shilling was enough.— And he said C—U—S! “And when I raised my eyes at that, He swore again at them, I said he was a wicked man, And he said D—A—M.” Now Jarvy's turn was come to speak, So he stroked down his hair, “All what she says is false—cause why? I'll swear I never swear! “There's old Joe Hatch, the waterman, Can tell you what I am; I'm one of seven children, all Brought up without a Dam! “He'll say from two year old and less Since ever I were nust, If ever I said C—U—S, I wish I may be cust! “At Sion Cottage I takes up, And raining all the while, To go to New Jerusalem, A wery long two mile. “Well, when I axes for my fare, She rows me in the street, And uses words as is not fit For coachmen to repeat! “Says she,—I know where you will go, You sinner! I know well,— Your worship, it's the P—I—T Of E and double L;” Now here his worship stopp'd the case— Said he—“I'll fine you both! And of the two—why Mrs. Cope's I think the biggest oath?” MISS FANNY'S FAREWELL FLOWERS. Not “the posie of a ring.” Shakespeare (all but the not). I came to town a happy man: I need not now dissemble Why I return so sad at heart— It's all through Fanny Kemble: Oh! when she threw her flowers away, What urged the tragic slut on To weave in such a wreath as that, Ah me! a bachelor's button. None fought so hard, none fought so well, As I to gain some token— When all the pit rose up in arms, And heads and hearts were broken; “Huzza!” said I, “I'll have a flow'r As sure as my name's Dutton;”— I made a snatch—I got a catch— By Jove! a bachelor's button! I've lost my watch—my hat is smashed— My clothes declare the racket; I went there in a full dress coat, And came home in a jacket. My nose is swell'd—my eye is black— My lip I've got a cut on! Odds buds!—and what a bud to get— The deuce! a bachelor's button! My chest's in pain; I really fear I've somewhat hurt my bellows, By pokes and punches in the ribs From those herb-strewing fellows. I miss two teeth in my front row; My corn has had a fut on; And all this pain I've had to gain This cursed bachelor's button. Had I but won a rose—a bud— A pansy—or a daisy— A periwinkle—anything— But this—it drives me crazy! My very sherry tastes like squills, I can't enjoy my mutton; And when I sleep I dream of it— Still—still—a bachelor's button! My place is booked per coach to-night, But oh, my spirit trembles To think how country friends will ask Of Knowleses and of Kembles. If they should breathe about the wreath, When I go back to Sutton, I shall not dare to show my share, That all!—a bachelor's button! My luck in life was never good, But this my fate will burden: I ne'er shall like my farming more,— I know I shan't the Garden. The turnips all may have the fly, The wheat may have the smut on, I care not,—I've a blight at heart,— Ah me!—a bachelor's button! REPLY TO A PASTORAL POET Tell us not of bygone days! Tell us not of forward times! What's the future—what's the past— Save to fashion rhymes? Show us that the corn doth thrive! Show us there's no wintry weather! Show us we may laugh and live— (Those who love—together.) Senses have we for sweet blossoms— Eyes, which could admire the sun— Passions blazing in our bosoms— Hearts, that may be won! But Labour doth for ever press us, And Famine grins upon our board; And none will help us, none will bless us, With one gentle word! None, none! our birthright or our fate, Is hunger and inclement air— Perpetual toil—the rich man's hate— Want, scorn—the pauper's fare: We fain would gaze upon the sky, Lie pensive by the running springs; But if we stay to gaze or sigh, We starve—though the cuckoo sings! The moon casts cold on us below; The sun is not our own; The very winds which fragrance blow, But blanch us to the bone; The rose for us ne'er shows its bloom, The violet its blue eye; From cradle murmuring to the tomb, We feel no beauty, no perfume, But only toil—and die! Pauper. ANSWER TO PAUPER. Don't tell me of buds and blossoms, Or with rose and vi'let wheedle— Nosegays grow for other bosoms, Churchwarden and Beadle. What have you to do with streams? What with sunny skies, or garish Cuckoo songs, or pensive dreams? Nature's not your parish! What right have such as you to dun For sun or moonbeams, warm or bright? Before you talk about the sun, Pay for window-light! Talk of passions—amorous fancies; While your betters' flames miscarry, If you love your Dolls and Nancys, Don't we make you marry? Talk of wintry chill and storm, Fragrant winds that blanch your bones! Your poor can always keep you warm;— Ain't there breaking stones? Suppose you don't enjoy the spring, Roses fair and vi'lets meek, You can't look for everything On eighteen pence a week! With seasons what have you to do? If corn doth thrive, or wheat is harmed! What's weather to the cropless? You Don't farm—but you are farmed! Why everlasting murmurs hurled, With hardship for the text? If such as you don't like this world, We'll pass you to the next. Overseer THE STAGE-STRUCK HERO. “It must be. So Plato?—Thou reasonest?—Well.” School Cato. It's very hard! oh, Dick, my boy, It's very hard one can't enjoy A little private spouting; But sure as Lear or Hamlet lives, Up comes our master, bounce! and gives The tragic muse a routing! Ay, there he comes again! be quick! And hide the book—a playbook, Dick, He must not set his eyes on! It's very hard, the churlish elf Will never let one stab one's self Or take a bowl of p'ison It's very hard, but when I want To die—as Cato did—I can't, Or go non compos mentis— But up he comes, all fire and flame;— No doubt he'd do the very same With Kemble for a 'prentice! Oh, Dick! Oh, Dick! it was not so Some half a dozen years ago! Melpomene was no sneaker, When, under Reverend Mister Poole, Each little boy at Enfield School Became an Enfield's speaker! No cruel master-tailor's cane Then thwarted the theatric vein; The tragic soil had tillage. O dear dramatic days gone by! You, Dick, were Richard then—and I Play'd Hamlet to the village, Or, as Macbeth, the dagger clutch'd, Till all the servant-maids were touch'd— Macbeth, I think, my pet is; Lord, how we spouted Shakespeare's works— Dick, we had twenty little Burkes, And fifty Master Betties! Why, there was Julius Cæsar Dunn, And Norval, Sandy Philips—one Of Elocution's champions— Genteelly taught by his mamma To say, not father, but papa, Kept sheep upon the Grampions! Coriolanus Crumpe—and Fig In Brutus, with brown-paper wig, And Huggins great in Cato; Only he broke so often off, To have a fit of whooping-cough, While reasoning with Plato. And Zangra too,—but I shall weep, If longer on this theme I keep, And let remembrance loose, Dick; Now forced to act—it's very hard— “Measure for Measure” with a yard— You Richard, with a goose, Dick! Zounds! Dick, it's very odd our dads Should send us there when we were lads To learn to talk like Tullies; And now, if one should just break out, Perchance, into a little spout, A stick about the skull is. Why should stage-learning form a part Of schooling for the tailor's art? Alas! dramatic notes, Dick, So well record the sad mistake Of him who tried at once to make Both Romeo and Coates, Dick! TO A CHILD EMBRACING HIS MOTHER. Love thy mother, little one! Kiss and clasp her neck again,— Hereafter she may have a son Will kiss and clasp her neck in vain. Love thy mother, little one! Gaze upon her living eyes, And mirror back her love for thee,— Hereafter thou mayst shudder sighs To meet them when they cannot see. Gaze upon her living eyes! Press her lips the while they glow With love that they have often told,— Hereafter thou mayst press in woe, And kiss them till thine own are cold. Press her lips the while they glow! Oh, revere her raven hair! Although it be not silver-grey; Too early Death, led on by Care, May snatch save one dear lock away. Oh! revere her raven hair! Pray for her at eve and morn, That Heaven may long the stroke defer,— For thou mayst live the hour forlorn When thou wilt ask to die with her. Pray for her at eve and morn! FRAGMENT. [I had a dream—the summer beam] I had a dream—the summer beam Play'd on the wings of merry hours— (Made long long smiles of merry hours); But Life 'gan throw a warp of woe, Across its tapestry of flowers, Fear's darker shade took form and made— Like shadows darkling in light most sparkling. The fragrant tombs amid the blooms Of April in a garden ground Show'd many a name that none could claim Half-read between the roses round. Unbanish'd clouds like coffin-shrouds Neighbour'd the sun amid the blue, And tearful streams mix'd with his beams, Yet made no promise as they flew. Young Hope indeed began to read The prophecies with cheerful look, But dark Despair look'd over there, And wept black blots upon her book. And scarce the form all bright and warm Of Joy was woven into birth When, like her shade, black Grief was laid Prone at her feet along the earth. Then do not chide—the sunny side Of monuments for Joy is made, But Sorrow still must weep her fill On those that lie beneath the shade. A HAPPY NEW YEAR! “If the affairs of this world did not make us so sad, 'Twould be easy enough to be merry.” —Old Song. There is nothing but plague in this house! There's the turbot is stole by the cat, The Newfoundland has eat up the grouse, And the haunch has been gnawed by a rat! It's the day of all days when I wish That our friends should enjoy our good cheer; Mr. Wiggins—our dinner is dished— But I wish you a happy New Year! Mr. Rudge has not called, but he will, For his Rates, Church, and Highway, and Poor, And the butcher has brought in his bill— Twice as much as the quarter before. Little Charles is come home with the mumps, And Matilda with measles, I fear; And I've taken two sov'reigns like dumps— But I wish you a happy New Year! Your poor brother is in the Gazette, And your banker is off to New York; Mr. Bigsby has died in your debt, And the “Wiggins” has foundered near Cork. Mr. Merrington's bill is come back; You are chosen to serve overseer; The new wall is beginning to crack— But I wish you a happy New Year! The best dinner-set's fallen to the ground; The militia's called out, and you're drawn; Not a piece of our plate can be found, And there's marks of men's feet on the lawn: Two anonymous letters have come, That declare you shall die like a Weare; And it may—or may not—be a hum— But I wish you a happy New Year! The old law-suit with Levy is lost; You are fined for not cleansing the street; And the water-pipe's burst with the frost, And the roof lets the rain in and sleet. Your old tenant at seventy-four Has gone off in the night with his gear, And has taken the key of the door— But I wish you a happy New Year! There's the “Sun” and the “Phœnix” to pay, For the chimney has blazed like Old Nick; The new gig has been jammed by a dray, And the old horse has taken to kick. We have hardly a bushel of small, And now coal is extravagant dear; Your great coat is stole out of the hall— But I wish you a happy New Year! The whole greenhouse is smashed by the hail, And the plants have all died in the night; The magnolia's blown down by the gale, And the chimney looks far from upright; And—the deuce take the man from the shop, That hung up the new glass chandelier!— It has come, in the end, to one drop— But I wish you a happy New Year! There's misfortune wherever we dodge— It's the same in the country and town; There's the porter has burned down his lodge, While he went off to smoke at the Crown. The fat butler makes free with your wine, And the footman has drunk the strong beer, And the coachman can't walk in a line— But I wish you a happy New Year! I have doubts if your clerk is correct— There are hints of a mistress at Kew, And some day he'll abscond, I expect; Mr. Brown has built out your back view; The new housemaid's the greatest of flirts— She has men in the house, that is clear; And the laundress has pawned all your shirts— But I wish you a happy New Year! Your “Account of a Visit to Rome” Not a critic on earth seems to laud; And old Huggins has lately come home, And will swear that your Claude isn't Claude: Your election is far from secure, Though it's likely to cost very dear; You're come out in a caricature— But I wish you a happy New Year! You've been christened an ass in the Times, And the Chronicle calls you a fool; And that dealer in boys, Dr. Ghrimes, Has engaged the next house for a school; And the playground will run by the bower Which you took so much trouble to rear; We shall never have one quiet hour— But I wish you a happy New Year! Little John will not take to his book, He's come home black and blue from the cane; There's your uncle is courting his cook, And your mother has married again! Jacob Jones will be tried with his wife, And against them you'll have to appear; If they're hung you'll be wretched for life— But I wish you a happy New Year! A PUBLIC DINNER. “Sit down and fall to, said the Barmecide.” —Arabian Nights. At seven you just nick it, Give card—get wine ticket; Walk round through the Babel, From table to table, To find—a hard matter— Your name in a platter; Your wish was to sit by Your friend Mr. Whitby, But Stewards' assistance Has placed you at distance, And, thanks to arrangers, You sit among strangers; But too late for mending; Twelve sticks come attending A stick of a Chairman, A little dark spare man, With bald shining nob, 'Mid Committee swell-mob; In short, a short figure, You thought the Duke bigger Then silence is wanted, Non Nobis is chanted; Then Chairman reads letter, The Duke's a regretter, A promise to break it, But chair he can't take it; Is grieved to be from us, But sends friend Sir Thomas And what is far better, A cheque in the letter, Hear! hear! and a clatter, And there ends the matter. Now soups come and fish in, And C??? brings a dish in; Then rages the battle, Knives clatter, forks rattle, Steel forks with black handles, Under fifty wax candles; Your soup-plate is soon full, You sip just a spoonful. Mr. Roe will be grateful To send him a plateful; And then comes the waiter, “Must trouble for tater;” And then you drink wine off With somebody—nine off; Bucellas made handy, With Cape and bad Brandy, Or East India Sherry, That's very hot—very. You help Mr. Myrtle, Then find your mock-turtle Went off, while you lingered, With waiter light-fingered. To make up for gammon, You order some salmon, Which comes to your fauces With boats without sauces. You then make a cut on Some Lamb big as Mutton; And ask for some grass too, But that you must pass too; It served the first twenty, But toast there is plenty. Then, while lamb gets coldish, A goose that is oldish— At carving not clever— You're begged to dissever, And when you thus treat it, Find no one will eat it. So, hungry as glutton, You turn to your mutton, But—no sight for laughter— The soup it's gone after. Mr. Green then is very Disposed to take Sherry, And then Mr. Nappy Will feel very happy; And then Mr. Conner Requests the same honour; Mr. Clarke, when at leisure, Will really feel pleasure; Then waiter leans over To take off a cover From fowls, which all beg of, A wing or a leg of; And while they all peck bone, You take to a neck bone, But even your hunger Declares for a younger. A fresh plate you call for, But vainly you bawl for: Now taste disapproves it, No waiter removes it. Still hope, newly budding, Relies on a pudding; But critics each minute Set fancy agin it— “That's queer Vermicelli.” “I say, Vizetelly, There's glue in that jelly.” “Tarts bad altogether; That crust's made of leather.” “Some custard, friend Vesey?” “No—batter made easy.” “Some cheese, Mr. Foster?” “—Don't like single Glo'ster.” Meanwhile, to top table, Like fox in the fable, You see silver dishes, With those little fishes, The whitebait delicious Borne past you officious; And hear rather plainish A sound that's champaignish, And glimpse certain bottles Made long in the throttles: And sniff—very pleasant! Grouse, partridge, and pheasant, And see mounds of ices For patrons and vices, Pine-apple, and bunches Of grapes for sweet munches, And fruits of all virtue That really desert you. You've nuts, but not crack ones, Half empty, and black ones; With oranges sallow— They can't be called yellow— Some pippins well wrinkled, And plums almond sprinkled, Some rout cakes, and so on, Then with business to go on; Long speeches are stutter'd, And toasts are well butter'd, While dames in the gallery, All dressed in fallallery, Look on at the mummery: And listen to flummery. Hip, hip! and huzzaing. And singing and saying, Glees, catches, orations, And lists of donations. Hush! a song, Mr. Tinney— “Mr. Benbow, one guinea; Mr. Frederick Manual, One guinea—and annual.” Song—Jockey and Jenny— “Mr. Markham one guinea.” “Have you all filled your glasses?’ Here's a health to good lasses. The subscription still skinny— “Mr. Franklin—one guinea.” Franklin looks like a ninny; “Mr. Boreham, one guinea— Mr. Blogg, Mr. Finney, Mr. Tempest—one guinea, Mr. Merrington—twenty,” Rough music, in plenty. Away toddles Chairman, The little dark spare man, Not sorry at ending, With white sticks attending, And some vain Tomnoddy Votes in his own body To fill the void seat up, And get on his feet up, To say, with voice squeaking, “Unaccustomed to speaking,” Which sends you off seeking Your hat, number thirty— No coach—very dirty. So, hungry and fever'd, Wet-footed, spoilt beaver'd, Eyes aching in socket, Ten pounds out of pocket, To Brook-street the Upper You haste home to supper. A CHARITY SERMON. “‘I would have walked many a mile to have communed with you; and, believe me, I will shortly pay thee another visit; but my friends, I fancy, wonder at my stay; so let me have the money immediately.’ Trulliber then put on a stern look, and cried out, ‘Thou dost not intend to rob me?’ ‘I would have thee know, friend,’ addressing himself to Adams, ‘I shall not learn my duty from such as thee. I know what charity is, better than to give to vagabonds.’” —Joseph Andrews. I'm an extremely charitable man—no collar and long hair, though a little carrotty; Demure, half-inclined to the unknown tongues, but I never gain'd anything by Charity. I got a little boy into the Foundling, but his unfortunate mother was traced and baited, And the overseers found her out—and she found me out— and the child was affiliated. Oh, Charity will come home to roost— Like curses and chickens is Charity. I once, near Whitehall's very old wall, when ballads danc'd over the whole of it, Put a bad five-shilling-piece into a beggar's hat, but the old hat had got a hole in it; And a little boy caught it in his little hat, and an officer's eye seem'd to care for it, As my bad crown piece went through his bad crown piece, and they took me up to Queen's Square for it. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. I let my very old (condemn'd) old house to a man, at a rent that was shockingly low, So I found a roof for his ten motherless babes—all defunct and fatherless now; For the plaguy one-sided party wall fell in, so did the roof, on son and daughter, And twelve jurymen sat on eleven bodies, and brought in a very personal verdict of Manslaughter. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. I pick'd up a young well-dress'd gentleman, who had fallen in a fit in St. Martin's Court, And charitably offer'd to see him home—for charity always seem'd to be my forte, And I've had presents for seeing fallen gentlemen home, but this was a very unlucky job— Do you know, he got my watch—my purse—and my hand- kerchief—for it was one of the swell mob. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. Being four miles from Town, I stopt a horse that had run away with a man, when it seem'd that they must be dash'd to pieces, Though several kind people were following him with all their might—but such following a horse his speed increases; I held the horse while he went to recruit his strength; and I meant to ride it home, of course; But the crowd came up and took me up—for it turn'd out the man had run away with the horse. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. I watch'd last month all the drovers and drivers about the suburbs, for it's a positive fact, That I think the utmost penalty ought always to be enforced against everybody under Mr. Martin's act; But I couldn't catch one hit over the horns, or over the shins, or on the ears, or over the head; And I caught a rheumatism from early wet hours, and got five weeks of ten swell'd fingers in bed. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. Well, I've utterly done with Charity, though I us'd so to preach about its finest fount; Charity may do for some that are more lucky, but I can't turn it to any account— It goes so the very reverse way—even if one chirrups it up with a dust of piety; That henceforth let it be understood, I take my name en- tirely out of the List of Subscribers to the Humane Society. Oh, Charity, &amp;c. THE CIGAR. “Here comes Mr. Puff.” —The Critic. ‘I knew by the smoke that so gracefully curl'd.” —Moore. Some sigh for this and that; My wishes don't go far; The world may wag at will, So I have my cigar. Some fret themselves to death With Whig and Tory jar I don't care which is in, So I have my cigar. Sir John requests my vote, And so does Mr. Marr; I don't care how it goes, So I have my cigar. Some want a German row, Some wish a Russian war; I care not—I'm at peace, So I have my cigar. I never see the Post, I seldom read the Star; The Globe I scarcely heed, So I have my cigar. They tell me that Bank Stock Is sunk much under par; It's all the same to me, So I have my cigar. Honours have come to men My juniors at the Bar; No matter—I can wait, So I have my cigar. Ambition frets me not; A cab or glory's car Are just the same to me, So I have my cigar. I worship no vain gods, But serve the household Lar; I'm sure to be at home, So I have my cigar. I do not seek for fame, A General with a scar; A private let me be, So I have my cigar. To have my choice among The toys of life's bazaar, The deuce may take them all, So I have my cigar. Some minds are often tost By tempests like a tar; I always seem in port, So I have my cigar. The ardent flame of love My bosom cannot char, I smoke, but do not burn, So I have my cigar. They tell me Nancy Low Has married Mr. R.; The jilt! but I can live, So I have my cigar. ODE TO ADMIRAL GAMBIER, G.C.B. ‘Well, if you reclaim such as Hood, your Society will deserve the thanks of the country.” —Temperance Society's Herald, vol. 1, No. 1, p. 8. “My father, when last I from Guinea Came home with abundance of wealth, Said, ‘Jack, never be such a ninny As to drink—’ says I, ‘Father, your health?’” Nothing like Grog. Oh! Admiral Gam—I dare not mention bier In such a temperate ear— Oh! Admiral Gam—an admiral of the Blue, Of course to read the Navy List aright, For strictly shunning wine of either hue, You can't be Admiral of the Red or White:— Oh, Admiral Gam! consider ere you call On merry Englishmen to wash their throttles With water only; and to break their bottles, To stick, for fear of trespass, on the wall Of Exeter Hall! Consider, I beseech, the contrariety Of cutting off our brandy, gin, and rum, And then, by tracts, inviting us to come And “mix in your society!” In giving rules to dine, or sup, or lunch, Consider Nature's ends before you league us To strip the Isle of Rum of all its punch— To dock the Isle of Mull of all its negus— Or doom—to suit your milk and water view— The Isle of Skye to nothing but sky-blue! Consider—for appearance' sake—consider The sorry figure of a spirit-ridder, Going on this crusade against the suttler; A sort of Hudibras—without a Butler! Consider—ere you break the ardent spirits Of father, mother, brother, sister, daughter; What are your beverage's washy merits? Gin may be low—but I have known low-water! Consider well, before you thus deliver, With such authority, your sloppy cannon; Should British tars taste nothing but the river, Because the Chesapeake once fought the Shannon! Consider, too—before all Eau-de-vie, Schiedam, or other drinkers, you rebut— To bite a bitten dog all curs agree; But who would cut a man because he's cut? Consider—ere you bid the poor to fill Their murmuring stomach with the “murmuring rill”— Consider that their streams are not like ours, Reflecting heaven, and margined by sweet flowers; On their dark pools by day no sun reclines, By night no Jupiter, no Venus shines; Consider life's sour taste, that bids them mix Their rum with Acheron, or gin with Styx; If you must pour out water to the poor, oh! Let it be aqua d'oro! Consider—ere as furious as a griffin, Against a glass of grog you make such work, A man may like a stiff'un, And yet not be a Burke! Consider, too, before you bid all skinkers Turn water-drinkers, What sort of fluid fills their native rivers; Their Mudiboos, and Niles, and Guadalquivirs. How should you like, yourself, in glass or mug, The Bog—the Bug— The Maine—the Weser—or that freezer, Neva? Nay, take the very rill of classic ground— Lord Byron found Even Castaly better for Geneva. Consider—if, to vote Reform's arrears, His Majesty should please to make you peers, Your titles would be very far from trumps, To figure in a book of blue and red:— The Duke of Draw-well—what a name to dread! Marquis of Main-pipe! Earl New-River-Head! And Temperance's chief, the Prince of Pumps! TO SPENCER PERCEVAL, ESQ., M.P. Oh, Mr. Spencer! I mean no offence, sir— Retrencher of each trencher—man or woman's; Maker of days of ember, Eloquent Member Of the House of Com—I mean to say short commons— Thou Long Tom Coffin singing out, “Hold Fast”— Avast! Oh, Mr. Perceval! I'll bet a dollar, a Great growth of Cholera, And new deaths reckon'd, Will mark thy Lenten Twenty-first and second. The best of our physicians, when they con it, Depose the malady is in the air: Oh, Mr. Spencer! if the ill is there, Why should you bid the people live upon it? Why should you make discourses against courses, While doctors, though they bid us rub and chafe, Declare, of all resources, The man is safest who gets in the safe? And yet you bid poor suicidal sinners Discard their dinners, Thoughtless how Heav'n above will look upon't, For man to die so wantonly of want! By way of a variety, Think of the ineffectual piety Of London's Bishop, at St. Faith's or Bride's, Lecturing such chamelion insides, Only to find He's preaching to the wind. Whatever others do,—or don't, I cannot—dare not—must not fast, and won't, Unless by night your day you let me keep, And fast asleep; My constitution can't obey such censors: must have meat Three times a-day to eat; My health's of such a sort,— To say the truth, in short, The coats of my stomach are not Spencers! THE CHINA-MENDER. Good morning, Mr. What-d'ye-call! Well! here's another pretty job! Lord help my Lady!—what a smash!—if you had only heard her sob! It was all through Mr. Lambert: but for certain he was winey, To think for to go to sit down on a table full of Chiney. “Deuce take your stupid head!” says my Lady to his very face; But politeness, you know, is nothing, when there's Chiney in the case; And if ever a woman was fond of Chiney to a passion It's my mistress, and all sorts of it, whether new or old fashion. Her brother's a sea-captain, and brings her home shiploads— Such bonzes, and such dragons, and nasty, squatting things like toads; And great nidnoddin' mandarins, with palsies in the head: I declare I've often dreamt of them, and had nightmares in my bed. But the frightfuller they are—lawk! she loves them all the better: She'd have Old Nick himself made of Chiney if they'd let her. Lawk-a-mercy! break her Chiney, and it's breaking her very heart; If I touch'd it, she would very soon say, “Mary, we must part.” To be sure she is unlucky: only Friday comes Master Randall, And breaks a broken spout, and fresh chips a tea-cup handle: He's a dear, sweet little child, but he will so finger and touch, And that's why my Lady doesn't take to children much. Well! there's stupid Mr. Lambert, with his two great coat flaps, Must go and sit down on the Dresden shepherdesses' laps, As if there was no such things as rosewood chairs in the room; I couldn't have made a greater sweep with the handle of the broom. Mercy on us! how my mistress began to rave and tear! Well! after all, there's nothing like good ironstone ware for wear. If ever I marry, that's flat, I'm sure it won't be John Dockery,— I should be a wretched woman in a shop full of crockery. I should never like to wipe it, though I love to be neat and tidy, And afraid of mad bulls on market-days every Monday and Friday. I'm very much mistook if Mr. Lambert's will be a catch; The breaking the Chiney will be the breaking-off of his own match. Missis wouldn't have an angel, if he was careless about Chiney; She never forgives a chip, if it's ever so small and tiny. Lawk! I never saw a man in all my life in such a taking; I could find in my heart to pity him for all his mischief-making. To see him stand a-hammering and stammering, like a zany; But what signifies apologies, if they won't mend old Chaney! If he sent her up whole crates full, from Wedgwood's and Mr. Spode's, He couldn't make amends for the crack'd mandarins and smash'd toads. Well! every one has their tastes, but, for my part, my own self, I'd rather have the figures on my poor dear grandmother's old shelf: A nice pea-green poll-parrot, and two reapers with brown ears of corns, And a shepherd with a crook after a lamb with two gilt horns, And such a Jemmy Jessamy in top boots and sky-blue vest, And a frill and flower'd waistcoat, with a fine bowpot at the breast. God help her, poor old soul! I shall come into 'em at her death, Though she's a hearty woman for her years, except her shortness of breath. Well! you think the things will mend—if they won't, Lord mend us all! My Lady will go in fits, and Mr. Lambert won't need to call: I'll be bound in any money, if I had a guinea to give, He won't sit down again on Chiney the longest day he has to live. Poor soul! I only hope it won't forbid his banns of marriage, Or he'd better have sat behind on the spikes of my Lady's carriage. But you'll join 'em all of course, and stand poor Mr. Lambert's friend; I'll look in twice a day, just to see, like, how they mend. To be sure it is a sight that might draw tears from dogs and cats; Here's this pretty little pagoda, now, has lost four of its cocked hats: Be particular with the pagoda: and then here's this pretty bowl— The Chinese Prince is making love to nothing because of this hole; And here's another Chinese man, with a face just like a doll— Do stick his pigtail on again, and just mend his parasol. But I needn't tell you what to do; only do it out of hand, And charge whatever you like to charge—my Lady won't make a stand. Well! good morning, Mr. What-d'ye-call; for it's time our gossip ended: And you know the proverb, the less as is said, the sooner the Chiney's mended. ODE TO MISS KELLY. ON HER OPENING THE STRAND THEATRE. O Betty—I beg pardon—Fanny K.! (I was just thinking of your Betty Finnikin)— Permit me this to say, In quite a friendly way— I like your theatre, though but a minnikin; For though small stages Kean dislikes to spout on, Renounce me if I don't agree with Dowton, The Minors are the Passions' proper schools. For me, I never can Find wisdom in the plan That keeps large reservoirs for little Pooles. I like your boxes where the audience sit A family circle; and your little pit; I like your little stage, where you discuss Your pleasant bill of fare, And show us passengers so rich and rare, Your little stage seems quite an omnibus. I like exceedingly your Parthian dame, Dimly remembering dramatic codgers, The ghost of Memory—the shade of Fame!— Lord! what a housekeeper for Mr. Rogers! I like your savage, of a one-horse power; And Terence, done in Irish from the Latin; And Sally—quite a kitchen-garden flower; And Mrs. Drake, serene in sky-blue satin! I like your girl as speechless as a mummy— It shows you can play dummy!— I like your boy, deprived of every gleam Of light for ever—a benighted being! And really think—though Irish it may seem— Your blindness is worth seeing. I like your Governess; and there's a striking Tale of Two Brothers, that sets tears a-flowing— But I'm not going All through the bill to tell you of my liking. Suffice it, Fanny Kelly! with your art So much in love, like others I have grown, I really mean myself to take a part In “Free and Easy”—at my own bespeak— And shall three times a week Drop in and make your pretty house my own!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME III. 1834. ODE TO SIR ANDREW AGNEW, BART. “At certain seasons he makes a prodigious clattering with his bill.” —Selby. “The bill is rather long, flat, and tinged with green.” —Bewick. Oh Andrew Fairservice—but I beg pardon, You never labour'd in Di Vernon's garden, On curly kale and cabbages intent— Andrew Churchservice was the thing I meant; You are a Christian, I would be the same, Although we differ, and I'll tell you why, Not meaning to make game, I do not like my Church so very High! When people talk, as talk they will, About your bill, They say, among their other jibes and small jeers, That, if you had your way, You'd make the seventh day As overbearing as the Dey of Algiers. Talk of converting Blacks— You make a thing so horrible of one day, Each nigger they will bet a something tidy, Would rather be a heathenish Man Friday, Than your Man Sunday! So poor men speak, Who, once a week, Perhaps, after weaving artificial flowers, Can snatch a glance of Nature's kinder bowers, And revel in a bloom That is not of the loom, Making the earth, the streams, the skies, the trees, A Chapel of Ease. Whereas, as you would plan it, Walled in with hard Scotch granite, People all day should look to their behaviours;— But though there be, as Shakspeare owns, “Sermons in stones,” Zounds! would you have us work at them like paviours? Spontaneous is pure devotion's fire; And in a green wood many a soul has built A new Church, with a fir-tree for its spire, Where Sin has prayed for peace, and wept for guilt, Better than if an architect the plan drew; We know of old how medicines were backed, But true Religion needs not to be quacked By an Un-merry Andrew! Suppose a poor town-weary sallow elf At Primrose-hill would renovate himself, Or drink (and no great harm) Milk genuine at Chalk Farm; The innocent intention who would baulk, And drive him back into St. Bennet Fink? For my part, for my life, I cannot think A walk on Sunday is “the Devil's Walk. But there's a sect of Deists, and their creed Is D?ing other people to be d?d; Yea, all that are not of their saintly level, They make a pious point To send, with an “aroint,” Down to that great Fillhellenist, the Devil. To such, a ramble by the River Lea, Is really treading on the “Banks of D?.” Go down to Margate, wisest of law-makers, And say unto the sea, as Canute did (Of course the sea will do as it is bid), “This is the Sabbath—let there be no breakers!” Seek London's Bishop, on some Sunday morn, And try him with your tenets to inoculate; Abuse his fine souchong, and say in scorn, “This is not Churchman's chocolate!” Or, seek Dissenters at their mid-day meal, And read them from your Sabbath Bill some passages, And while they eat their mutton, beef, and veal, Shout out with holy zeal— “These are not Chappel's sausages!” Suppose your Act should act up to your will, Yet how will it appear to Mrs. Grundy, To hear you saying of this pious bill, “It works well—on a Sunday!” To knock down apple-stalls is now too late, Except to starve some poor old harmless madam;— You might have done some good, and changed our fate, Could you have upset that which ruined Adam! 'Tis useless to prescribe salt-cod and eggs, Or lay post-horses under legal fetters, While Tattersall's on Sunday stirs its Legs, Folks look for good examples from their Betters! Consider—Acts of Parliament may bind A man to go where Irvings are discoursing; But as for forcing “proper frames of mind,” Minds are not framed, like melons, for such forcing! Remember, as a Scottish legislator, The Scotch Kirk always has a Moderator; Meaning, one need not ever be sojourning In a long Sermon Lane without a turning. Such grave old maids as Portia and Zenobia May like discourses with a skein of threads, And love a lecturé for its many heads; But as for me, I have the Hydra-phobia. Religion one should never overdo: Right glad I am no minister you be, For you would say your service, sir, to me, Till I should say, “My service, sir, to you.” Six days made all that is, you know, and then, Came that of rest, by holy ordination, As if to hint unto the sons of men, After creation should come re-creation. Read right this text, and do not further search To make a Sunday Workhouse of the Church. QUEEN MAB. A little fairy comes at night, Her eyes are blue, her hair is brown, With silver spots upon her wings, And from the moon she flutters down. She has a little silver wand, And when a good child goes to bed She waves her wand from right to left, And makes a circle round its head. And then it dreams of pleasant things, Of fountains filled with fairy fish, And trees that bear delicious fruit And bow their branches at a wish: Of arbours filled with dainty scents From lovely flowers that never fade; Bright flies that glitter in the sun, And glow-worms shining in the shade: And talking birds with gifted tongues, For singing songs and telling tales, And pretty dwarfs to show the way Through fairy hills and fairy dales. But when a bad child goes to bed. From left to right she weaves her rings, And then it dreams all through the night Of only ugly, horrid things! Then lions come with glaring eyes, And tigers growl, a dreadful noise, And ogres draw their cruel knives, To shed the blood of girls and boys. Then stormy waves rush on to drown, Or raging flames come scorching round, Fierce dragons hover in the air, And serpents crawl along the ground. Then wicked children wake and weep, And wish the long black gloom away; But good ones love the dark, and find The night as pleasant as the day.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV. 1835. SONNET TO OCEAN. Shall I rebuke thee, Ocean, my old love, That once, in rage, with the wild winds at strife, Thou darest menace my unit of a life, Sending my clay below, my soul above, Whilst roar'd thy waves, like lions when they rove By night, and bound upon their prey by stealth? Yet didst thou ne'er restore my fainting health?— Didst thou ne'er murmur gently like the dove? Nay, dost thou not against my own dear shore Full break, last link between my land and me?— My absent friends talk in thy very roar, In thy waves' beat their kindly pulse I see, And, if I must not see my England more, Next to her soil, my grave be found in thee! Coblenz, May, 1835. TO ?. COMPOSED AT ROTTERDAM. I gaze upon a city,— A city new and strange,— Down many a watery vista My fancy takes a range; From side to side I saunter, And wonder where I am; And can you be in England, And I at Rotterdam! Before me lie dark waters In broad canals and deep, Whereon the silver moonbeams Sleep, restless in their sleep; A sort of vulgar Venice Reminds me where I am; Yes, yes, you are in England, And I'm at Rotterdam. Tall houses with quaint gables, Where frequent windows shine, And quays that lead to bridges, And trees in formal line, And masts of spicy vessels From western Surinam, All tell me you're in England, But I'm in Rotterdam. Those sailors, how outlandish The face and form of each! They deal in foreign gestures, And use a foreign speech; A tongue not learn'd near Isis, Or studied by the Cam, Declares that you're in England, And I'm at Rotterdam. And now across a market My doubtful way I trace, Where stands a solemn statue, The Genius of the place; And to the great Erasmus I offer my salaam; Who tells me you're in England But I'm at Rotterdam. The coffee-room is open— I mingle in its crowd,— The dominos are noisy— The hookahs raise a cloud; The flavour, none of Fearon's, That mingles with my dram, Reminds me you're in England, And I'm at Rotterdam. Then here it goes, a bumper— The toast it shall be mine, In schiedam, or in sherry, Tokay, or hock of Rhine; It well deserves the brightest, Where sunbeam ever swam— “The Girl I love in England” I drink at Rotterdam! March, 1835. SONNET. [Think, sweetest, if my lids are not now wet] Think, sweetest, if my lids are not now wet, The tenderest tears lie ready at the brim, To see thine own dear eyes—so pale and dim,— Touching my soul with full and fond regret, For on thy ease my heart's whole care is set; Seeing I love thee in no passionate whim, Whose summer dates but with the rose's trim, Which one hot June can perish and beget,— Ah, no! I chose thee for affection's pet, For unworn love, and constant cherishing— To smile but to thy smile—or else to fret When thou art fretted—rather than to sing Elsewhere. Alas! I ought to soothe and kiss Thy dear pale cheek while I assure thee this! LINES ON SEEING MY WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN SLEEPING IN THE SAME CHAMBER. And has the earth lost its so spacious round, The sky its blue circumference above, That in this little chamber there is found Both earth and heaven—my universe of love! All that my God can give me, or remove, Here sleeping, save myself, in mimic death. Sweet that in this small compass I behove To live their living and to breathe their breath! Almost I wish that, with one common sigh, We might resign all mundane care and strife, And seek together that transcendent sky, Where Father, Mother, Children, Husband, Wife, Together pant in everlasting life! Coblenz, Nov., 1835. STANZAS. [Is there a bitter pang for love removed] Is there a bitter pang for love removed, Oh God! The dead love doth not cost more tears Than the alive, the loving, the beloved— Not yet, not yet beyond all hopes and fears! Would I were laid Under the shade Of the calm grave, and the long grass of years,— That love might die with sorrow:—I am sorrow; And she, that loves me tenderest, doth press Most poison from my cruel lips, and borrow Only new anguish from the old caress; Oh, this world's grief, Hath no relief, In being wrung from a great happiness. Would I had never filled thine eyes with love, For love is only tears: would I had never Breathed such a curse-like blessing as we prove; Now, if “Farewell” could bless thee, I would sever! Would I were laid Under the shade, Of the cold tomb, and the long grass for ever! 1836. A TOAST. Come! a health! and it's not to be slighted with sips, A cold pulse, or a spirit supine— All the blood in my heart seems to rush to my lips, To commingle its flow with the wine. Bring a cup of the purest and solidest ware,— But a little antique in its shape; And the juice,—let it be the most racy and rare, All the bloom, with the age, of the grape! Even such is the love I would celebrate now, At once young, and mature, and in prime,— Like the tree of the orange, that shows on its bough The bud, blossom and fruit at one time! Then with three, as is due, let the honours be paid, Whilst I give with my hand, heart, and head, “Here's to her, the fond mother, dear partner, kind maid, Who first taught me to love, woo, and wed!” SONG FOR THE NINETEENTH. The morning sky is hung with mist, The rolling drum the street alarms, The host is paid, his daughter kiss'd, So now to arms, so now to arms. Our evening bowl was strong and stiff, And may we get such quarters oft, I ne'er was better lodged, for if The straw was hard, the maid was soft. So now to arms, to arms, to arms, And fare you well, my little dear, And if they ask who won your charms, Why say 'twas in your Nineteenth Year. 1837. THE BLUE BOAR. 'Tis known to man, 'tis known to woman, 'Tis known to all the world in common, How politics and party strife Vex public, even private, life; But, till some days ago, at least They never worried brutal beast. I wish you could have seen the creature, A tame domestic boar by nature, Gone wild as boar that ever grunted, By Baron Hoggerhausen hunted. His back was up, and on its ledge The bristles rose like quickset hedge; His eye was fierce and red as coal, Like furnace, shining through a hole, And restless turn'd for mischief seeking; His very hide with rage was reeking; And oft he gnash'd his crooked tusks, Chewing his tongue instead of husks, Till all his jaw was white and yesty, Showing him savage, fierce, and resty. And what had caused this mighty vapour? A dirty fragment of a paper, That in his rambles he had found, Lying neglected on the ground; A relic of the Morning Post, Two tattered columns at the most, But which our irritated swine (Derived from Learned Toby's line) Digested easy as his meals, Like any quidnunc Cit at Peel's. He read, and mused, and pored and read, His shoulders shrugg'd, and shook his head; Now at a line he gave a grunt, Now at a phrase took sudden stunt, And snorting turn'd his back upon it, But always came again to con it; In short he petted up his passion, After a very human fashion, When Temper's worried with a bone She'll neither like nor let alone. At last his fury reach'd the pitch Of that most irritating itch, When mind and will, in fever'd faction, Prompt blood and body into action; No matter what, so bone and muscle May vent the frenzy in a bustle; But whether by a fight or dance Is left to impulse and to chance. So stood the Boar, in furious mood Made up for any thing but good; He gave his tail a tighter twist, As men in anger clench the fist, And threw fresh sparkles in his eye From the volcano in his fry— Ready to raze the parish pound, To pull the pigsty to the ground, To lay Squire Giles, his master, level, Ready, indeed, to play the devil. So, stirr'd by raving demagogues, I've seen men rush, like rabid dogs, Stark staring from the Pig and Whistle, And like his Boarship, in a bristle, Resolved unanimous on rumpus From any quarter of the compass; But whether to duck Aldgate Pump, (For wits in madness never jump) To liberate the beasts from Cross's; Or hiss at all the Wigs in Ross's; On Waithman's column hang a weeper; Or tar and feather the old sweeper; Or break the panes of landlord scurvy, And turn the King's Head topsy-turvy; Rebuild, or pull down, London Wall; Or take his cross from old Saint Paul; Or burn those wooden Highland fellows, The snuff-men's idols, 'neath the gallows! None fix'd or cared—but all were loyal To one design—a battle royal. Thus stood the Boar, athirst for blood, Trampling the Morning Post to mud, With tusks prepared to run a muck;— And sorrow for the mortal's luck That came across him Whig or Tory, It would have been a tragic story— But fortune interposing now, Brought Bessy into play—a Sow;— A fat, sleek, philosophic beast, That never fretted in the least, Whether her grains were sour or sweet, For grains are grains, and she could eat. Absorb'd in two great schemes capacious, The farrow, and the farinaceous, If cares she had, they could not stay, She drank, and wash'd them all away. In fact this philosophic sow Was very like a German frow; In brief—as wit should be and fun,— If sows turn Quakers, she was one; Clad from the duckpond, thick and slab, In bran-new muddy suit of drab. To still the storm of such a lubber, She came like oil—at least like blubber— Her pigtail of as passive shape As ever droop'd o'er powder'd nape; Her snout, scarce turning up—her deep Small eyes half settled into sleep; Her ample ears, dependent, meek, Like fig-leaves shading either cheek; Whilst, from the corner of her jaw, A sprout of cabbage, green and raw, Protruded,—as the Dove, so stanch For Peace, supports an olive branch,— Her very grunt, so low and mild, Like the soft snoring of a child, Inquiring into his disquiets, Served like the Riot Act, at riots,— He laid his restive bristles flatter, And took to arguefy the matter. “O Bess, O Bess, here's heavy news! They mean to 'mancipate the Jews! Just as they turn'd the blacks to whites, They want to give them equal rights, And, in the twinkling of a steeple, Make Hebrews quite like other people. Here, read—but I forget your fetters, You've studied litters more than letters.” “Well,” quoth the Sow, “and no great miss, I'm sure my ignorance is bliss; Contentedly I bite and sup, And never let my flare flare-up; Whilst you get wild and fuming hot— What matters Jews be Jews or not? Whether they go with beards like Moses, Or barbers take them by the noses, Whether they live, permitted dwellers, In Cheapside shops, or Rag Fair cellars, Or climb their way to civic perches, Or go to synagogues or churches?” “Churches!—ay, there the question grapples, No, Bess, the Jews will go to Chappell's!” “To chapel—well—what's that to you? A Berkshire Boar, and not a Jew? We pigs,—remember the remark Of our old drover Samuel Slark, When trying, but he tried in vain, To coax me into Sermon Lane, Or Paternoster's pious Row,— But still I stood and grunted No! Of Lane of Creed an equal scorner, Till bolting off, at Amen Corner, He cried, provoked at my evasion, ‘Pigs, blow 'em! ar'n't of no persuasion!’” “The more's the pity, Bess,—the more—” Said, with sardonic grin, the Boar; “If Pigs were Methodists and Bunyans, They'd make a sin of sage and onions; The curse of endless flames endorse On every boat of apple-sauce; Give brine to Satan, and assess Blackpuddings with bloodguiltiness; Yea, call down heavenly fire and smoke To burn all Epping into coke!” “Ay,” cried the Sow, extremely placid, In utter contrast to his acid, “Ay, that would be a Sect indeed! And every swine would like the creed, The sausage-making curse and all; And should some brother have a call, To thump a cushion to that measure, I would sit under him with pleasure; Nay, put down half my private fortune T' endow a chapel at Hog's Norton.— But what has this to do, my deary, With their new Hebrew whigmaleery?” “Sow that you are! this Bill, if current, Would be as good as our death-warrant;— And, with its legislative friskings, Loose twelve new tribes upon our griskins! Unjew the Jews, what follows then? Why, they'll eat pork like other men, And you shall see a Rabbi dish up A chine as freely as a Bishop! Thousands of years have pass'd, and pork Was never stuck on Hebrew fork; But now, suppose that relish rare Fresh added to their bill of fare, Fry, harslet, pettitoes, and chine, Leg, choppers, bacon, ham, and loin, And then, beyond all goose or duckling”— “Yes, yes—a little tender suckling! It must be held the aptest savour To make the eager mouth to slaver! Merely to look on such a gruntling, A plump, white, sleek and sappy runtling, It makes one—ah! remembrance bitter! It made me eat my own dear litter!” “Think, then, with this new waken'd fury, How we should fare if tried by Jewry! A pest upon the meddling Whigs! There'll be a pretty run on pigs! This very morn a Hebrew brother, With three hats stuck on one another, And o'er his arm a bag, or poke, A thing pigs never find a joke, Stopp'd,—rip the fellow!—though he knew I've neither coat to sell nor shoe, And cock'd his nose—right at me, lovey! Just like a pointer at a covey! To set our only friends agin us! That neither care to fat nor thin us! To boil, to broil, to roast, or fry us, But act like real Christians by us!— A murrain on all legislators! Thin wash, sour grains, and rotten 'taters! A bulldog at their ears and tails! The curse of empty troughs and pails Famish their flanks as thin as weasels! May all their children have the measles; Or in the straw untimely smother, Or make a dinner for the mother! A cartwhip for all law inventors! And rubbing-posts stuck full of tenters! Yokes, rusty rings, and gates, to hitch in, And parish pounds to pine the flitch in, Cold, and high winds, the Devil send 'em— And then may Sam the Sticker end 'em!” 'Twas strange to hear him how he swore! A Boar will curse, though like a boar, While Bess, like Pity, at his side Her swine-subduing voice supplied! She bade him such a rage discard; That anger is a foe to lard; 'Tis bad for sugar to get wet, And quite as bad for fat to fret; “Besides,”—she argued thus at last— “The Bill you fume at has not pass'd, For why, the Commons and the Peers Have come together by the ears: Or rather, as we pigs repose, One's tail beside the other's nose, And thus, of course, take adverse views Whether of Gentiles or of Jews. Who knows? They say the Lords' ill-will Has thrown out many a wholesome Bill, And p'rhaps some Peer to Pigs propitious May swamp a measure so Jew-dish-us!” The Boar was conquer'd: at a glance, He saw there really was a chance— That as the Hebrew nose is hooked, The Bill was equally as crooked; And might outlast, thank party embers, A dozen tribes of Christian members;— So down he settled in the mud, With smoother back, and cooler blood, As mild, as quiet, a Blue Boar, As any over tavern-door. MORAL. The chance is small that any measure Will give all classes equal pleasure; Since Tory Ministers or Whigs, Sometimes can't even “please the Pigs.” LOVE LANE. If I should love a maiden more, And woo her ev'ry hope to crown, I'd love her all the country o'er, But not declare it out of town. One even, by a mossy bank, That held a hornet's nest within, To Ellen on my knees I sank,— How snakes will twine around the shin! A bashful fear my soul unnerved, And gave my heart a backward tug; Nor was I cheer'd when she observed, Whilst I was silent,—“What a slug!” At length my offer I preferr'd, And Hope a kind reply forebode— Alas! the only sound I heard Was, “What a horrid ugly toad!” I vow'd to give her all my heart, To love her till my life took leave, And painted all a lover's smart— Except a wasp gone up his sleeve! But when I ventured to abide Her father's and her mother's grants— Sudden, she started up, and cried, “O dear! I am all over ants!” Nay, when beginning to beseech The cause that led to my rebuff, The answer was as strange a speech, “A Daddy-Longlegs sure enough!” I spoke of fortune—house,—and lands, And still renew'd the warm attack,— 'Tis vain to offer ladies hands That have a spider on the back! 'Tis vain to talk of hopes and fears, And hope the least reply to win, From any maid that stops her ears In dread of earwigs creeping in! 'Tis vain to call the dearest names Whilst stoats and weazels startle by— As vain to talk of mutual flames, To one with glow-worms in her eye! What check'd me in my fond address, And knock'd each pretty image down? What stopp'd my Ellen's faltering Yes? A caterpillar on her gown! To list to Philomel is sweet— To see the Moon rise silver-pale,— But not to kneel at Lady's feet And crush a rival in a snail! Sweet is the eventide, and kind Its zephyr, balmy as the south; But sweeter still to speak your mind Without a chafer in your mouth! At last, embolden'd by my bliss, Still fickle Fortune play'd me foul, For when I strove to snatch a kiss She scream'd—by proxy, through an owl! Then, Lovers, doom'd to life or death, Shun moonlight, twilight, lanes, and bats, Lest you should have in selfsame breath To bless your fate—and curse the gnats! DRINKING SONG. BY A MEMBER OF A TEMPERANCE SOCIETY, AS SUNG BY MR. SPRING, AT WATERMAN'S HALL. Come, pass round the pail, boys, and give it no quarter, Drink deep, and drink oft, and replenish your jugs, Fill up, and I'll give you a toast to your water— The Turncock for ever! that opens the plugs! Then hey for a bucket, a bucket, a bucket, Then hey for a bucket, filled up to the brim! Or, best of all notions, let's have it by oceans, With plenty of room for a sink or a swim! Let topers of grape-juice exultingly vapour, But let us just whisper a word to the elves, We water roads, horses, silks, ribands, bank-paper, Plants, poets, and muses, and why not ourselves? Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. The vintage they cry, think of Spain's and of France's, The jigs, the boleros, fandangos, and jumps; But water's the spring of all civilised dances, We go to a ball not in bottles, but pumps! Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. Let others of Dorchester quaff at their pleasure, Or honour old Meux with their thirsty regard— We'll drink Adam's ale, and we get it pool measure, Or quaff heavy wet from the butt in the yard! Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. Some flatter gin, brandy, and rum, on their merits, Grog, punch, and what not, that enliven a feast: Tis true that they stir up the animal spirits, But may not the animal turn out a beast? Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. The Man of the Ark, who continued our species, He saved us by water,—but as for the wine, We all know the figure, more sad than facetious, He made after tasting the juice of the vine. Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. In wine let a lover remember his jewel And pledge her in bumpers fill'd brimming and oft; But we can distinguish the kind from the cruel, And toast them in water, the hard or the soft. Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. Some cross'd in their passion can never o'erlook it, But take to a pistol, a knife, or a beam; Whilst temperate swains are enabled to brook it By help of a little meandering stream. Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. Should fortune diminish our cash's sum-total, Deranging our wits and our private affairs, Though some in such cases would fly to the bottle, There's nothing like water for drowning our cares. Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. See drinkers of water, their wits never lacking, Direct as a railroad and smooth in their gaits; But look at the bibbers of wine, they go tacking, Like ships that have met a foul wind in the straits. Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. A fig then for Burgundy, Claret, or Mountain, A few scanty glasses must limit your wish, But he's the true toper that goes to the fountain, The drinker that verily “drinks like a fish!” Then hey for a bucket, &amp;c. THE DESERT-BORN. “Fly to the desert, fly with me.” —Lady Hester Stanhope. 'Twas in the wilds of Lebanon, amongst its barren hills,— To think upon it, even now, my very blood it chills!— My sketch-book spread before me, and my pencil in my hand, I gazed upon the mountain range, the red tumultuous sand, The plumy palms, the sombre firs, the cedars tall and proud,— When lo! a shadow pass'd across the paper like a cloud, And looking up I saw a form, apt figure for the scene,— Methought I stood in presence of some oriental queen! The turban on her head was white as any driven snow; A purple bandalette past o'er the lofty brow below, And thence upon her shoulders fell, by either jewell'd ear; In yellow folds voluminous she wore her long cachemere; Whilst underneath, with ample sleeves, a Turkish robe of silk Enveloped her in drapery the colour of new milk; Yet oft it floated wide in front, disclosing underneath A gorgeous Persian tunic, rich with many a broider'd wreath, Compell'd by clasps of costly pearl around her neck to meet— And yellow as the amber were the buskins on her feet! Of course I bow'd my lowest bow—of all the things on earth, The reverence due to loveliness, to rank, or ancient birth, To power, to wealth, to genius, or to anything uncommon, A man should bend the lowest in a Desert to a Woman! Yet some strange influence stronger still, though vague and undefined, Compell'd me, and with magic might subdued my soul and mind; There was a something in her air that drew the spirit nigh, Beyond the common witchery that dwells in woman's eye! With reverence deep, like any slave of that peculiar land, I bow'd my forehead to the earth, and kiss'd the arid sand; And then I touch'd her garment's hem, devoutly as a Dervise, Predestinated (so I felt) for ever to her service. Nor was I wrong in auguring thus my fortune from her face, She knew me, seemingly, as well as any of her race; “Welcome!” she cried, as I uprose submissive to my feet; “It was ordain'd that you and I should in this desert meet! Aye, ages since, before thy soul had burst its prison bars, This interview was promised in the language of the stars!” Then clapping, as the Easterns wont, her all-commanding hands, A score of mounted Arabs came fast spurring o'er the sands, Nor rein'd they up their foaming steeds till in my very face They blew the breath impetuous, and panting from the race. “Fear nought,” exclaim'd the radiant one, as I sprang off aloof, “Thy precious frame need never fear a blow from horse's hoof! Thy natal star was fortunate as any orb of birth, And fate hath held in store for thee the rarest gift of earth.” Then turning to the dusky men, that humbly waited near, She cried, “Go bring the Beautiful—for lo! the Man is here!” Off went th' obsequious train as swift as Arab hoofs could flee, But Fancy fond out-raced them all, with bridle loose and free, And brought me back, for love's attack, some fair Circassian bride, Or Georgian girl, the Harem's boast, and fit for sultan's side; Methought I lifted up her veil, and saw dark eyes beneath, Mild as gazelle's, a snowy brow, ripe lips, and pearly teeth, A swanlike neck, a shoulder round, full bosom, and a waist Not too compact, and rounded limbs, to oriental taste. Methought—but here, alas! alas! the airy dream to blight, Behold the Arabs leading up a mare of milky white! To tell the truth, without reserve, evasion, or remorse, The last of creatures in my love or liking is a horse: Whether in early youth some kick untimely laid me flat, Whether from born antipathy, as some dislike a cat, I never yet could bear the kind, from Meux's giant steeds Down to those little bearish cubs of Shetland's shaggy breeds;— As for a warhorse, he that can bestride one is a hero, Merely to look at such a sight my courage sinks to zero. With lightning eyes, and thunder mane, and hurricanes of legs, Tempestuous tail—to picture him description vainly begs! His fiery nostrils send forth clouds of smoke instead of breath— Nay, was it not a Horse that bore the grisly Shape of Death? Judge then how cold an ague-fit of agony was mine To see the mistress of my fate, imperious, make a sign To which my own foreboding soul the cruel sense supplied: “Mount, happy man, and run away with your Arabian bride!” Grim was the smile, and tremulous the voice with which I spoke, Like any one's when jesting with a subject not a joke, So men have trifled with the axe before the fatal stroke. “Lady, if mine had been the luck in Yorkshire to be born, Or any of its Ridings, this would be a blessed morn: But, hapless one! I cannot ride—there's something in a horse That I can always honour, but I never could endorse. To speak still more commercially, in riding I am quite Averse to running long, and apt to be paid-off at sight: In legal phrase, for every class to understand me still, I never was in stirrups yet a tenant but at will; Or, if you please, in artist terms, I never went a-straddle On any horse without ‘a want of keeping’ in the saddle. In short,” and here I blush'd, abash'd, and held my head full low, “I'm one of those whose infant years have heard the chimes of Bow!” The lady smiled, as houris smile, adown from Turkish skies, And beams of cruel kindness shone within her hazel eyes; “Stranger,” she said, “or rather say, my nearest, dearest friend, There's something in your eyes, your air, and that high instep's bend, That tells me you're of Arab race,—whatever spot of earth, Cheapside, or Bow, or Stepney, had the honour of your birth, The East it is your country! Like an infant changed at nurse By fairies, you have undergone a nurtureship perverse; But this—these desert sands—these palms, and cedars waving wild, All, all, adopt thee as their own—an oriental child— The cloud may hide the sun awhile—but soon or late, no doubt, The spirit of your ancestry will burst and sparkle out! I read the starry characters—and lo! 'tis written there, Thou wert foredoom'd of sons of men to ride upon this Mare, A Mare till now was never back'd by one of mortal mould, Hark, how she neighs, as if for thee she knew that she was foal'd!” And truly—I devoutly wish'd a blast of the simoom Had stifled her!—the Mare herself appear'd to mock my doom; With many a bound she caper'd round and round me like a dance, I fear'd indeed some wild caress would end the fearful prance, And felt myself, and saw myself—the phantasy was horrid!— Like old Redgauntlet, with a shoe imprinted on my forehead! On bended knees, with bowing head, and hands upraised in prayer, I begg'd the turban'd Sultaness the issue to forbear; I painted weeping orphan babes around a widow'd wife, And drew my death as vividly as others draw from life. “Behold,” I said, “a simple man, for such high feats unfit, Who never yet has learn'd to know the crupper from the bit, Whereas the boldest horsemanship, and first equestrian skill, Would well be task'd to bend so wild a creature to the will.” Alas! alas! 'twas all in vain, to supplicate and kneel, The quadruped could not have been more cold to my appeal! “Fear nothing,” said the smiling Fate, “when human help is vain, Spirits shall by thy stirrups fly, and fairies guide the rein; Just glance at yonder animal, her perfect shape remark, And in thy breast at once shall glow the oriental spark! As for thy spouse and tender babes, no Arab roams the wild But for a Mare of such descent would barter wife and child.” “Nay then,” cried I—(heav'n shrive the lie!) “to tell the secret truth, 'Twas my unhappy fortune once to over-ride a youth! A playful child,—so full of life!—a little fair-hair'd boy, His sister's pet, his father's hope, his mother's darling joy! Ah me! the frantic shriek she gave! I hear it ringing now! That hour, upon the bloody spot, I made a holy vow; A solemn compact, deeply sworn, to witness my remorse, That never more these limbs of mine should mount on living horse!” Good heaven! to see the angry glance that flash'd upon me now! A chill ran all my marrow through—the drops were on my brow! I knew my doom, and stole a glance at that accursed Mare, And there she stood, with nostrils wide, that snuff'd the sultry air. How lion-like she lash'd her flanks with her abundant tail; While on her neck the stormy mane kept tossing to the gale! How fearfully she roll'd her eyes between the earth and sky, As if in wild uncertainty to gallop or to fly! While with her hoof she scoop'd the sand as if before she gave My plunge into eternity she meant to dig my grave! And I, that ne'er could calmly bear a horse's ears at play, Or hear without a yard of jump his shrill and sudden neigh— Whose foot within a stable-door had never stood an inch— Whose hand to pat a living steed would feel an awful flinch,— I that had never thrown a leg across a pony small To scour the pathless desert on the tallest of the tall! For oh! it is no fable, but at ev'ry look I cast, Her restless legs seem'd twice as long as when I saw them last! In agony I shook,—and yet, although congeal'd by fears, My blood was boiling fast, to judge from noises in my ears; I gasp'd as if in vacuo, and thrilling with despair, Some secret Demon seem'd to pass his fingers through my hair. I could not stir—I could not speak—I could not even see— A sudden mist rose up between that awful Mare and me,— I tried to pray, but found no words—tho' ready ripe to weep, No tear would flow,—o'er ev'ry sense a swoon began to creep,— When lo! to bring my horrid fate at once unto the brunt, Two Arabs seized me from behind, two others in the front, And ere a muscle could be strung to try the strife forlorn, I found myself, Mazeppa-like, upon the Desert-Born! Terrific was the neigh she gave, the moment that my weight Was felt upon her back, as if exulting in her freight; Whilst dolefully I heard a voice that set each nerve ajar,— “Off with the bridle—quick!—and leave his guidance to his star!” “Allah! il Allah!” rose the shout,—and starting with a bound, The dreadful Creature clear'd at once a dozen yards of ground; And grasping at her mane with both my cold convulsive hands, Away we flew—away! away! across the shifting sands! My eyes were closed in utter dread of such a fearful race, But yet by certain signs I knew we went no earthly pace, For turn whichever way we might, the wind with equal force Rush'd like a torrid hurricane still adverse to our course— One moment close at hand I heard the roaring Syrian Sea, The next it only murmur'd like the humming of a bee! And when I dared at last to glance across the wild immense, Oh, ne'er shall I forget the whirl that met the dizzy sense! What seem'd a little sprig of fern, ere lips could reckon twain, A palm of forty cubits high, we passed it on the plain! What tongue could, tell—what pencil paint,—what pen describe the ride? Now off—now on—now up—now down,—and flung from side to side! I tried to speak, but had no voice, to soothe her with its tone— My scanty breath was jolted out with many a sudden groan— My joints were rack'd—my back was strain'd, so firmly I had clung— My nostrils gush'd, and thrice my teeth had bitten through my tongue— When lo!—farewell all hope of life!—she turn'd and faced the rocks, None but a flying horse could clear those monstrous granite blocks! So thought I,—but I little knew the desert pride and fire, Derived from a most deer-like dam, and lion-hearted sire; Little I guess'd the energy of muscle, blood, and bone, Bound after bound, with eager springs, she clear'd each massive stone;— Nine mortal leaps were pass'd before a huge grey rock at length Stood planted there as if to dare her utmost pitch of strength— My time was come! that granite heap my monument of death! She paused, she snorted loud and long, and drew a fuller breath; Nine strides and then a louder beat that warn'd me of her spring, I felt her rising in the air like eagle on the wing— But oh! the crash!—the hideous shock!—the million sparks around! Her hindmost hoofs had struck the crest of that prodigious mound! Wild shriek'd the headlong Desert-Born—or else 'twas demon's mirth, One second more, and Man and Mare roll'd breathless on the earth! How long it was I cannot tell ere I revived to sense, And then but to endure the pangs of agony intense; For over me lay powerless, and still as any stone, The Corse that erst had so much fire, strength, spirit, of its own. My heart was still—my pulses stopp'd—midway 'twixt life and death, With pain unspeakable I fetch'd the fragment of a breath, Not vital air enough to frame one short and feeble sigh, Yet even that I loath'd because it would not let me die. Oh, slowly, slowly, slowly on, from starry night till morn, Time flapp'd along, with leaden wings, across that waste forlorn! I cursed the hour that brought me first within this world of strife— A sore and heavy sin it is to scorn the gift of life— But who hath felt a horse's weight oppress his labouring breast? Why any who has had, like me, the NIGHT MARE on his chest. ODE TO DOCTOR HAHNEMANN, THE HOMŒOPATHIST. Well, Doctor, Great concoctor Of medicines to help in man's distress; Diluting down the strong to meek, And making ev'n the weak more weak, “Fine by degrees, and beautifully less”— Founder of a new system economic, To druggists anything but comic; Framed the whole race of Ollapods to fret, At profits, like thy doses, very small; To put all Doctors' Boys in evil case, Thrown out of bread, of physic, and of place,— And show us old Apothecaries' Hall “To Let.” How fare thy Patients? are they dead or living, Or, well as can expected be, with such A style of practice, liberally giving “A sum of more to that which had too much?” Dost thou preserve the human frame, or turf it? Do thorough draughts cure thorough colds or not? Do fevers yield to anything that's hot? Or hearty dinners neutralise a surfeit? Is't good advice for gastronomic ills, When Indigestion's face with pain is crumpling, To cry “Discard those Peristaltic Pills, Take a hard dumpling?” Tell me, thou German Cousin, And tell me honestly without a diddle, Does an attenuated dose of rosin Act as a tonic on the old Scotch fiddle? Tell me, when Anhalt-Coethen babies wriggle, Like eels just caught by sniggle, Martyrs to some acidity internal, That gives them pangs infernal, Meanwhile the lip grows black, the eye enlarges; Say, comes there all at once a cherub-calm, Thanks to that soothing homœopathic balm, The half of half, of half, a drop of “varges?” Suppose, for instance, upon Leipzig's plain, A soldier pillow'd on a heap of slain, In urgent want both of a priest and proctor; When lo! there comes a man in green and red, A featherless cock'd-hat adorns his head, In short a Saxon military doctor— Would he, indeed, on the right treatment fix, To cure a horrid gaping wound, Made by a ball that weigh'd a pound, If he well pepper'd it with number six? Suppose a felon doom'd to swing Within a rope, Might friends not hope To cure him with a string? Suppose his breath arrived at a full stop, The shades of death in a black cloud before him, Would a quintillionth dose of the New Drop Restore him? Fancy a man gone rabid from a bite, Snapping to left and right, And giving tongue like one of Sebright's hounds, Terrific sounds, The pallid neighbourhood with horror cowing, To hit the proper homœopathic mark; Now, might not “the last taste in life” of bark, Stop his bow-wow-ing? Nay, with a well-known remedy to fit him, Would he not mend, if with all proper care, He took “a hair Of the dog that bit him?” Picture a man—we'll say a Dutch Meinheer— In evident emotion, Bent o'er the bulwark of the Batavier, Owning those symptoms queer— Some feel in a Sick Transit o'er the ocean, Can anything in life be more pathetic Than when he turns to us his wretched face?— But would it mend his case To be decillionth-dosed With something like the ghost Of an emetic? Lo! now a darken'd room! Look through the dreary gloom, And see that coverlet of wildest form, Tost like the billows in a storm, Where ever and anon, with groans, emerges A ghastly head! While two impatient arms still beat the bed, Like a strong swimmer's struggling with the surges; There Life and Death are on their battle-plain, With many a mortal ecstasy of pain— What shall support the body in its trial, Cool the hot blood, wild dream, and parching skin, And tame the raging malady within— A sniff of Next-to-Nothing in a phial? Oh! Doctor Hahnemann, if here I laugh, And cry together, half and half, Excuse me, 'tis a mood the subject brings, To think, whilst I have crow'd like chanticleer, Perchance, from some dull eye the hopeless tear Hath gush'd, with my light levity at schism, To mourn some Martyr of Empiricism! Perchance, on thy own system, I have given A pang superfluous to the pains of Sorrow, Who weeps with Memory from morn till even; Where comfort there is none to lend or borrow, Sighing to one sad strain, “She will not come again, To-morrow, nor to-morrow, nor to-morrow!” Doctor, forgive me, if I dare prescribe A rule for thee thyself, and all thy tribe, Inserting a few serious words by stealth; Above all price of wealth The Body's Jewel,—not for minds profane, Or hands, to tamper with in practice vain— Like to a Woman's Virtue is Man's Health. A heavenly gift within a holy shrine! To be approach'd and touch'd with serious fear, By hands made pure, and hearts of faith severe, Even as the Priesthood of the ONE divine! But, zounds! each fellow with a suit of black. And, strange to fame, With a diploma'd name, That carries two more letters pick-a-back, With cane, and snuff-box, powder'd wig, and block, Invents his dose, as if it were a chrism, And dares to treat our wondrous mechanism, Familiar as the works of old Dutch clock; Yet, how would common sense esteem the man, Oh how, my unrelated German cousin, Who having some such time-keeper on trial, And finding it too fast, enforced the dial, To strike upon the Homœopathic plan Of fourteen to the dozen? Take my advice, 'tis given without a fee, Drown, drown your book ten thousand fathoms deep Like Prospero's beneath the briny sea, For spells of magic have all gone to sleep! Leave no decillionth fragment of your works, To help the interests of quacking Burkes; Aid not in murdering even widow's mites,— And now forgive me for my candid zeal, I had not said so much, but that I feel Should you take ill what here my Muse indites, An Ode-ling more will set you all to rights. AGRICULTURAL DISTRESS. A PASTORAL REPORT. One Sunday morning—service done— 'Mongst tombstones shining in the sun, A knot of bumpkins stood to chat Of that and this, and this and that; What people said of Polly Hatch— Which side had won the cricket match; And who was cotch'd, and who was bowl'd;— How barley, beans, and 'taters sold— What men could swallow at a meal— When Bumstead Youths would ring a peal— And who was taken off to jail— And where they brew'd the strongest ale— At last this question they address, “What's Agricultural Distress?” HODGE. “For my peart, it's a thought o' mine, It be the fancy farming line, Like yonder gemman,—him I mean, As took the Willa nigh the Green,— And turn'd his cattle in the wheat; And gave his porkers hay to eat; And sent his footman up to town, To ax the Lonnon gentry down, To be so kind as make his hay Exactly on St. Swithin's day;— With consequences you may guess— That's Hagricultural Distress.” DICKON. “Last Monday morning, Master Blogg Com'd for to stick our bacon-hog; But th' hog he cock'd a knowing eye, As if he twigg'd the reason why, And dodged and dodged 'un such a dance, He didn't give the noose a chance; So Master Blogg at last lays off, And shams a rattle at the trough, When swish! in bolts our bacon-hog Atwixt the legs o' Master Blogg, And flops him down in all the muck, As hadn't been swept up by luck— Now that, accordin' to my guess, Be Hagricultural Distress.” GILES. “No, that arn't it, I tell'ee flat; I'ze bring a worser case nor that! Last Friday week, I takes a start To Reading, with our horse and cart; Well, when I'ze set the 'taters down. I meets a crony at the Crown; And what betwixt the ale and Tom, It's dark afore I starts for home; So whipping hard, by long and late, At last we reaches nigh the gate, And, sure enough, there Master stand, A lantern flaring in his hand,— ‘Why, Giles,’ says he, ‘what's that 'un thear? Yond' chestnut horse bean't my bay mear! He bean't not worth a leg o' Bess!’ There's Hagricultural Distress?” HOB. “That's nothin' yet, to Tom's mishap! A-gooing through the yard, poor chap, Only to fetch his milking-pails, When up he shies like head or tails; Nor would the Bull let Tom a-be, Till he had toss'd the best o' three;— And there lies Tom with broken bones. A surgeon's job for Doctor Jones; Well, Doctor Jones lays down the law, ‘There's two crackt ribs, besides a jaw,— Eat well,' says he, ‘stuff out your case, For that will keep the ribs in place;’ But how was Tom, poor chap, to chaw, Seeing as how he'd broke his jaw? That's summut to the pint—yes, yes, That's Hagricultural Distress?’ SIMON. “Well, turn and turn about is fair: Tom's bad anough, and so's the mare; But nothing to my load of hay. You see, 'twas hard on quarter-day, And cash was wanted for the rent; So up to Lonnon I was sent, To sell as prime a load of hay As ever dried on summer's day. “Well, standing in Whitechapel Road, A chap comes up to buy my load, And looks, and looks about the cart, Pretending to be 'cute and smart; But no great judge, as people say, 'Cause why? he never smelt the hay. Thinks I, as he's a simple chap, He'll give a simple price mayhap, Such buyers comes but now and then, So slap I axes nine pun' ten. ‘That's dear,’ says he, and pretty quick He taps his leathers with his stick. ‘Suppose,’ says he, ‘we wet our clay, Just while we bargin 'bout the hay.’ So in we goes, my chap and me; He drinks to I, and I to he; At last, says I, a little gay, ‘It's time to talk about that hay.’ ‘Nine pund,’ says he, ‘and I'm your man, Live, and let live—for that's my plan.’ ‘That's true,’ says I, ‘but still I say, It's nine pun' ten for that 'ere hay.’ And so we chaffers for a bit, At long and last the odds we split; And off he sets to show the way, Where up a yard I leaves the hay. Then, from the pocket of his coat, He pulls a book, and picks a note. ‘That's Ten,’ says he—‘I hope to pay Tens upon tens for loads of hay.’ ‘With all my heart, and soon,’ says I, And feeling for the change thereby; But all my shillings com'd to five— Says he, ‘No matter man alive! There's something in your honest phiz I'd trust, if twice the sum it is;— You'll pay next time you come to town.’ ‘As sure,’ says I, ‘as corn is brown.’ ‘All right,’ says he.—Thinks I ‘huzza! He's got no bargain of the hay!’ “Well, home I goes, with empty cart, Whipping the horses pretty smart, And whistling ev'ry yard o' way, To think how well I'd sold the hay— And just cotch'd Master at his greens And bacon, or it might be beans, Which didn't taste the worse surely, To hear his hay had gone so high. But lord! when I laid down the note, It stuck the victuals in his throat, And choked him till his face all grew Like pickling-cabbage, red and blue; With such big goggle eyes, Ods nails! They seem'd a-coming out like snails'! ‘A note,’ says he, half mad with passion, ‘Why, thou dom'd fool? thou'st took a flash 'un!’ Now, wasn't that a pretty mess? That's Hagricultural Distress.” COLIN. “Phoo! phoo! You're nothing near the thing! You only argy in a ring; 'Cause why? You never cares to look, Like me, in any larned book; But schollards know the wrong and right Of every thing in black and white. “Well, Farming, that's its common name, And Agriculture be the same: So put your Farming first, and next Distress, and there you have your text. But here the question comes to press, What farming be, and what's distress? Why, farming is to plough and sow, Weed, harrow, harvest, reap and mow, Thrash, winnow, sell,—and buy and breed The proper stock to fat and feed. Distress is want, and pain, and grief, And sickness,—things as wants relief; Thirst, hunger, age, and cold severe; In short, ax any overseer,— Well, now, the logic for to chop, Where's the distress about a crop? There's no distress in keeping sheep, I likes to see 'em frisk and leap; There's no distress in seeing swine Grow up to pork and bacon fine; There's no distress in growing wheat And grass for men or beasts to eat; And making of lean cattle fat, There's no distress, of course, in that. Then what remains?—But one thing more, And that's the Farming of the Poor!” HODGE, DICKON, GILES, HOB, AND SIMON. “Yea!—aye!—surely!—for sartin!—yes!— That's Hagricultural Distress!” ODE TO MESSRS. GREEN, HOLLOND, MONCK MASON, ON THEIR LATE BALLOON EXPEDITION. “Here we go up, up, up,—and there we go down, down, downy.” Old Ballad. O lofty-minded men! Almost beyond the pitch of my goose pen! And most inflated words! Delicate Ariels! ethereals!—birds Of passage! fliers! angels without wings! Fortunate rivals of Icarian darings! Male-witches, without broomsticks,—taking airings! Kites—without strings! Volatile spirits! light mercurial humours! O give us soon your sky adventures truly, With full particulars, correcting duly All flying rumours! Two-legg'd high-fliers! What upper-stories you must have to tell! And nobody can contradict you well, Or call you liars! Your Region of Romance will many covet; Besides that, you may scribble what you will, And this great luck will wait upon you, still All criticism, you will be above it! Write, then, Messrs. Monck Mason, Hollond, Green! And tell us all you have, or havn't seen!— ['Twas kind, when the balloon went out of town, To take Monck Mason up and set him down, For when a gentleman is at a shift For carriage—talk of carts and gigs, and coaches! Nothing to a balloon approaches, For giving one a lift!] O say, when Mr. Frederick Gye Seem'd but a speck—a mote—in friendship's eye, Did any tongue confess a sort of dryness Seeming the soaring rashness to rebuke; Or did each feel himself, like Brunswick's Duke, A most serene Highness! Say, as you cross'd the Channel, Well clothed in well air'd linen and warm flannel, How did your company, perceived afar, Affect the tar? Methinks I see him cock his weather eye Against the sky, Turning his ruminating quid full oft, With wonder sudden taken all aback— “My eyes!” says he, “I'm blow'd if there arn't three! Three little Cherubs smiling up aloft, A-watching for poor Jack!” Of course, at such a height, the ocean Affected no one by its motion— But did internal comfort dwell with each, Quiet and ease each comfortable skin in? Or did brown Hollond of a sudden bleach As white as Irish linen? Changing his native hue, Did Green look blue?— In short was any air-sick? P'rhaps Monck Mason Was forc'd to have an air-pump in a bason? Say, with what sport, or pleasure, Might you fill up your lofty leisure? Like Scotchman, at High jinks? (High-spy was an appropriate game methinks) Or cards—but playing very high;— Or skying coppers, almost to the sky;— Or did you listen, the first mortal ears That ever drank the music of the spheres?— Or might you into vocal music get, A trio—highly set? Or, as the altitude so well allow'd, Perchance, you “blew a cloud.” Say, did you find the air Give you an appetite up there? Your cold provisions—were you glad to meet 'em? Or did you find your victuals all so high,— Or blown so by your fly— You couldn't eat 'em? Of course, you took some wine to sup, Although the circumstance has not been stated; I envy you the effervescing cup! Warn't your champagne well up? Nay, you, yourselves, a little elevated? Then, for your tea and breakfast, say, Was it not something delicately new, To get sky-blue Right genuine from the real milky way? Of course, you all agreed, Whate'er your conversation was about, Like friends indeed,— And faith! not without need, 'Twas such an awkward place for falling-out! Say, after your gastronomy, Kept you a watch all night, Marking the planets bright, Like three more Airys, studying astronomy; Or near the midnight chime, Did some one haul his nightcap on his head, Hold out his mounted watch, and say “high time To go to bed?” Didn't your coming scare The sober Germans, until every cap Rose lifted by a frighten'd fell of hair; Meanwhile the very pipe, mayhap, Extinguish'd, like the vital spark in death, From wonder locking up the smoker's breath! Didn't they crouch like chickens, when the kite Hovers in sight, To see your vehicle of huge dimension Aloft, like Gulliver's Laputa—nay, I'd better say, The Island of Ascension? Well was it plann'd To come down thus into the German land, Where Honours you may score by such event,— For, if I read the prophecy aright, You'll have the Eagle-Order for your flight, And all be Von'd, because of your descent! ODE TO RAE WILSON, ESQ. “Close, close your eyes with holy dread, And weave a circle round him thrice; For he on honey-dew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise.” —Coleridge. “It's very hard them kind of men Won't let a body be.” —Old Ballad. A wanderer, Wilson, from my native land, Remote, O Rae, from godliness and thee, Where rolls between us the eternal sea, Besides some furlongs of a foreign sand,— Beyond the broadest Scotch of London Wall; Beyond the loudest Saint that has a call; Across the wavy waste between us stretch'd, A friendly missive warns me of a stricture, Wherein my likeness you have darkly etch'd, And though I have not seen the shadow sketch'd, Thus I remark prophetic on the picture. I guess the features:—in a line to paint Their moral ugliness, I'm not a saint. Not one of those self-constituted saints, Quacks—not physicians—in the cure of souls, Censors who sniff out mortal taints, And call the devil over his own coals— Those pseudo Privy Councillors of God, Who write down judgments with a pen hard-nibb'd; Ushers of Beelzebub's Black Rod, Commending sinners, not to ice thick-ribb'd, But endless flames, to scorch them up like flax— Yet sure of heav'n themselves, as if they'd cribb'd Th' impression of St. Peter's keys in wax! Of such a character no single trace Exists, I know, in my fictitious face; There wants a certain cast about the eye; A certain lifting of the nose's tip; A certain curling of the nether lip, In scorn of all that is, beneath the sky; In brief it is an aspect deleterious, A face decidedly not serious, A face profane, that would not do at all To make a face at Exeter Hall,— That Hall where bigots rant, and cant, and pray, And laud each other face to face, Till ev'ry farthing-candle ray Conceives itself a great gas-light of grace Well!—be the graceless lineaments confest! I do enjoy this bounteous beauteous earth; And dote upon a jest “Within the limits of becoming mirth;”— No solemn sanctimonious face I pull, Nor think I'm pious when I'm only bilious— Nor study in my sanctum supercilious To frame a Sabbath Bill or forge a Bull. I pray for grace—repent each sinful act— Peruse, but underneath the rose, my Bible; And love my neighbour far too well, in fact, To call and twit him with a godly tract That's turn'd by application to a libel. My heart ferments not with the bigot's leaven, All creeds I view with toleration thorough, And have a horror of regarding heaven As anybody's rotten borough. What else? no part I take in party fray, With tropes from Billingsgate's slang-whanging tartars, I fear no Pope—and let great Ernest play At Fox and Goose with Fox's Martyrs! I own I laugh at over-righteous men, I own I shake my sides at ranters, And treat sham-Abr'am saints with wicked banters, I even own, that there are times—but then It's when I've got my wine—I say d? canters! I've no ambition to enact the spy On fellow souls, a Spiritual Pry— 'Tis said that people ought to guard their noses, Who thrust them into matters none of theirs; And tho' no delicacy discomposes Your Saint, yet I consider faith and pray'rs Amongst the privatest of men's affairs. I do not hash the Gospel in my books, And thus upon the public mind intrude it, As if I thought, like Otaheitan cooks, No food was fit to eat till I had chew'd it. On Bible stilts I don't affect to stalk; Nor lard with Scripture my familiar talk,— For man may pious texts repeat, And yet religion have no inward seat; 'Tis not so plain as the old Hill of Howth, A man has got his belly full of meat Because he talks with victuals in his mouth! Mere verbiage,—it is not worth a carrot! Why, Socrates—or Plato—where's the odds?— Once taught a jay to supplicate the Gods, And made a Polly-theist of a Parrot! A mere professor, spite of all his cant, is Not a whit better than a Mantis,— An insect, of what clime I can't determine, That lifts its paws most parson-like, and thence, By simple savages—thro' sheer pretence— Is reckon'd quite a saint amongst the vermin. But where's the reverence, or where the nous, To ride on one's religion thro' the lobby, Whether a stalking-horse or hobby, To show its pious paces to “the House?” I honestly confess that I would hinder The Scottish member's legislative rigs, That spiritual Pinder, Who looks on erring souls as straying pigs. That must be lash'd by law, wherever found. And driv'n to church, as to the parish pound. I do confess, without reserve or wheedle, I view that grovelling idea as one Worthy some parish clerk's ambitious son, A charity-boy, who longs to be a beadle. On such a vital topic sure 'tis odd How much a man can differ from his neighbour: One wishes worship freely giv'n to God, Another wants to make it statute-labour— The broad distinction in a line to draw, As means to lead us to the skies above, You say—Sir Andrew and his love of law, And I—the Saviour with his law of love. Spontaneously to God should tend the soul, Like the magnetic needle to the Pole; But what were that intrinsic virtue worth, Suppose some fellow, with more zeal than knowledge, Fresh from St. Andrew's College, Should nail the conscious needle to the north? I do confess that I abhor and shrink From schemes, with a religious willy-nilly, That frown upon St. Giles's sins, but blink The peccadilloes of all Piccadilly— My soul revolts at such a bare hypocrisy, And will not, dare not, fancy in accord The Lord of Hosts with an Exclusive Lord Of this world's aristocracy. It will not own a notion so unholy, As thinking that the rich by easy trips May go to heav'n, whereas the poor and lowly Must work their passage, as they do in ships. One place there is—beneath the burial sod Where all mankind are equalised by death; Another place there is—the Fane of God, Where all are equal, who draw living breath;— Juggle who will elsewhere with his own soul, Playing the Judas with a temporal dole— He who can come beneath that awful cope, In the dread presence of a Maker just, Who metes to ev'ry pinch of human dust One even measure of immortal hope— He who can stand within that holy door, With soul unbow'd by that pure spirit-level, And frame unequal laws for rich and poor,— Might sit for Hell and represent the Devil! Such are the solemn sentiments, O Rae, In your last Journey-Work, perchance you ravage, Seeming, but in more courtly terms, to say I'm but a heedless, creedless, godless savage; A very Guy, deserving fire and faggots,— A Scoffer, always on the grin, And sadly given to the mortal sin Of liking Mawworms less than merry maggots! The humble records of my life to search, I have not herded with mere pagan beasts; But sometimes I have “sat at good men's feasts,’ And I have been “where bells have knoll'd to church.” Dear bells! how sweet the sounds of village bells When on the undulating air they swim! Now loud as welcomes! faint, now, as farewells! And trembling all about the breezy dells As flutter'd by the wings of Cherubim. Meanwhile the bees are chanting a low hymn; And lost to sight th' ecstatic lark above Sings, like a soul beatified, of love,— With, now and then, the coo of the wild pigeon;— O Pagans, Heathens, Infidels and Doubters! If such sweet sounds can't woo you to religion, Will the harsh voices of church cads and touters? A man may cry “Church! Church!” at ev'ry word, With no more piety than other people— A daw's not reckon'd a religious bird Because it keeps a-cawing from a steeple. The Temple is a good, a holy place, But quacking only gives it an ill savour; While saintly mountebanks the porch disgrace, And bring religion's self into disfavour! Behold you servitor of God and Mammon, Who, binding up his Bible with his Ledger, Blends Gospel texts with trading gammon, A black-leg saint, a spiritual hedger, Who backs his rigid Sabbath, so to speak Against the wicked remnant of the week, A saving bet against his sinful bias— “Rogue that I am,” he whispers to himself, “I lie—I cheat—do anything for pelf, But who on earth can say I am not pious?” In proof how over-righteousness re-acts, Accept an anecdote well based on facts. One Sunday morning—(at the day don't fret)— In riding with a friend to Ponder's End Outside the stage, we happen'd to commend A certain mansion that we saw To Let. “Ay,” cried our coachman, with our talk to grapple, “You're right! no house along the road comes nigh it 'Twas built by the same man as built yon chapel, And master wanted once to buy it,— But t'other driv the bargain much too hard— He ax'd sure-ly a sum purdigious! But being so particular religious, Why, that, you see, put master on his guard!” Church is “a little heav'n below, I have been there and still would go,”— Yet I am none of those, who think it odd A man can pray unbidden from the cassock, And, passing by the customary hassock, Kneel down remote upon the simple sod, And sue in formâ pauperis to God. As for the rest,—intolerant to none, Whatever shape the pious rite may bear, Ev'n the poor Pagan's homage to the Sun I would not harshly scorn, lest even there I spurn'd some elements of Christian pray'r— An aim, tho' erring, at a “world ayont”— Acknowledgment of good—of man's futility, A sense of need, and weakness, and indeed That very thing so many Christians want— Humility. Such, unto Papists, Jews or turban'd Turks, Such is my spirit—(I don't mean my wraith!) Such, may it please you, is my humble faith; I know, full well, you do not like my works! I have not sought, 'tis true, the Holy Land, As full of texts as Cuddie Headrigg's mother, The Bible in one hand, And my own common-place-book in the other— But you have been to Palestine—alas! Some minds improve by travel, others, rather, Resemble copper wire, or brass, Which gets the narrower by going farther! Worthless are all such Pilgrimages—very! If Palmers at the Holy Tomb contrive The human heats and rancour to revive That at the Sepulchre they ought to bury. A sorry sight it is to rest the eye on, To see a Christian creature graze at Sion, Then homeward, of the saintly pasture full, Rush bellowing, and breathing fire and smoke, At crippled Papistry to butt and poke, Exactly as a skittish Scottish bull Hunts an old woman in a scarlet cloak! Why leave a serious, moral, pious home, Scotland, renown'd for sanctity of old, Far distant Catholics to rate and scold For—doing as the Romans do at Rome? With such a bristling spirit wherefore quit The Land of Cakes for any land of wafers, About the graceless images to flit, And buzz and chafe importunate as chafers, Longing to carve the carvers to Scotch collops?— People who hold such absolute opinions Should stay at home, in Protestant dominions, Not travel like male Mrs. Trollopes. Gifted with noble tendency to climb, Yet weak at the same time, Faith is a kind of parasitic plant, That grasps the nearest stem with tendril-rings; And as the climate and the soil may grant, So is the sort of tree to which it clings. Consider then, before, like Hurlothrumbo, You aim your club at any creed on earth, That, by the simple accident of birth, You might have been High Priest to Mumbo Jumbo. For me—thro' heathen ignorance perchance, Not having knelt in Palestine,—I feel None of that griffinish excess of zeal, Some travellers would blaze with here in France. Dolls I can see in Virgin-like array, Nor for a scuffle with the idols hanker Like crazy Quixote at the puppet's play, If their “offence be rank,” should mine be rancour? Mild light, and by degrees, should be the plan To cure the dark and erring mind; But who would rush at a benighted man, And give him two black eyes for being blind? Suppose the tender but luxuriant hop Around a canker'd stem should twine, What Kentish boor would tear away the prop So roughly as to wound, nay, kill the bine? The images, 'tis true, are strangely dress'd, With gauds and toys extremely out of season; The carving nothing of the very best, The whole repugnant to the eye of reason, Shocking to Taste, and to Fine Arts a treason— Yet ne'er o'erlook in bigotry of sect One truly Catholic, one common form, At which uncheck'd All Christian hearts may kindle or keep warm. Say, was it to my spirit's gain or loss, One bright and balmy morning, as I went From Liege's lovely environs to Ghent, If hard by the wayside I found a cross, That made me breathe a pray'r upon the spot— While Nature of herself, as if to trace The emblem's use, had trail'd around its base The blue significant Forget-me-not? Methought, the claims of Charity to urge More forcibly, along with Faith and Hope, The pious choice had pitch'd upon the verge Of a delicious slope, Giving the eye much variegated scope;— “Look round,” it whisper'd “on that prospect rare, Those vales so verdant, and those hills so blue; Enjoy the sunny world, so fresh, and fair, But”—(how the simple legend pierced me thro'!) “Priez pour les Malheureux.” With sweet kind natures, as in honey'd cells, Religion lives, and feels herself at home; But only on a formal visit dwells Where wasps instead of bees have formed the comb. Shun pride, O Rae!—whatever sort beside You take in lieu, shun spiritual pride! A pride there is of rank—a pride of birth, A pride of learning, and a pride of purse, A London pride—in short, there be on earth A host of prides, some better and some worse; But of all prides, since Lucifer's attaint, The proudest swells a self-elected Saint. To picture that cold pride so harsh and hard, Fancy a peacock in a poultry yard. Behold him in conceited circles sail, Strutting and dancing, and now planted stiff, In all his pomp of pageantry, as if He felt “the eyes of Europe” on his tail! As for the humble breed retain'd by man, He scorns the whole domestic clan— He bows, he bridles, He wheels, he sidles, At last, with stately dodgings in a corner He pens a simple russet hen, to scorn her Full in the blaze of his resplendent fan! “Look here,” he cries (to give him words), “Thou feather'd clay—thou scum of birds!” Flirting the rustling plumage in her eyes,— “Look here, thou vile predestined sinner, Doom'd to be roasted for a dinner, Behold these lovely variegated dyes! These are the rainbow colours of the skies, That Heav'n has shed upon me con amore— A Bird of Paradise?—a pretty story! I am that Saintly Fowl, thou paltry chick! Look at my crown of glory! Thou dingy, dirty, drabbled, draggled jill!” And off goes Partlet, wriggling from a kick, With bleeding scalp laid open by his bill! That little simile exactly paints How sinners are despised by saints. By saints!—the Hypocrites that ope heav'n's door Obsequious to the sinful man of riches— But put the wicked, naked, barelegg'd poor, In parish stocks instead of breeches. The Saints!—the Bigots that in public spout, Spread phosphorus of zeal on scraps of fustian, And go like walking “Lucifers” about Mere living bundles of combustion. The Saints!—the aping Fanatics that talk All cant and rant, and rhapsodies highflown— That bid you baulk A Sunday walk, And shun God's work as you should shun your own. The Saints!—the Formalists, the extra pious, Who think the mortal husk can save the soul, By trundling with a mere mechanic bias, To church, just like a lignum-vitæ bowl! The Saints!—the Pharisees, whose beadle stands Beside a stern coercive kirk. A piece of human mason-work, Calling all sermons contrabands, In that great Temple that's not made with hands! Thrice blessed, rather, is the man, with whom The gracious prodigality of nature, The balm, the bliss, the beauty, and the bloom, The bounteous providence in ev'ry feature, Recall the good Creator to his creature, Making all earth a fane, all heav'n its dome! To his tuned spirit the wild heather-bells Ring Sabbath knells; The jubilate of the soaring lark Is chant of clerk; For choir, the thrush and the gregarious linnet; The sod's a cushion for his pious want; And, consecrated by the heav'n within it, The sky-blue pool, a font. Each cloud-capp'd mountain is a holy altar; An organ breathes in every grove; And the full heart's a Psalter, Rich in deep hymns of gratitude and love! Sufficiently by stern necessitarians Poor Nature, with her face begrimed by dust, Is stoked, coked, smoked, and almost choked; but must Religion have its own Utilitarians, Labell'd with evangelical phylacteries, To make the road to heav'n a railway trust, And churches—that's the naked fact—mere factories? Oh! simply open wide the Temple door, And let the solemn, swelling, organ greet, With Voluntaries meet, The willing advent of the rich and poor! And while to God the loud Hosannas soar, With rich vibrations from the vocal throng— From quiet shades that to the woods belong, And brooks with music of their own, Voices may come to swell the choral song With notes of praise they learn'd in musings lone. How strange it is while on all vital questions, That occupy the House and public mind, We always meet with some humane suggestions Of gentle measures of a healing kind, Instead of harsh severity and vigour, The Saint alone his preference retains For bills of penalties and pains, And marks his narrow code with legal rigour! Why shun, as worthless of affiliation, What men of all political persuasion Extol—and even use upon occasion— That Christian principle, Conciliation? But possibly the men who make such fuss With Sunday pippins and old Trots infirm, Attach some other meaning to the term, As thus: One market morning, in my usual rambles, Passing along Whitechapel's ancient shambles, Where meat was hung in many a joint and quarter, I had to halt awhile, like other folks, To let a killing butcher coax A score of lambs and fatted sheep to slaughter. A sturdy man he look'd to fell an ox, Bull-fronted, ruddy, with a formal streak Of well-greased hair down either cheek, As if he dee-dash-dee'd some other flocks Beside those woolly-headed stubborn blocks That stood before him, in vexatious huddle— Poor little lambs, with bleating wethers group'd, While, now and then, a thirsty creature stoop'd And meekly snuff'd, but did not taste the puddle. Fierce bark'd the dog, and many a blow was dealt, That loin, and chump, and scrag and saddle felt, Yet still, that fatal step they all declined it,— And shunn'd the tainted door as if they smelt Onions, mint sauce, and lemon juice behind it. At last there came a pause of brutal force, The cur was silent, for his jaws were full Of tangled locks of tarry wool, The man had whoop'd and holloed till dead hoarse. The time was ripe for mild expostulation, And thus it stammer'd from a stander-by— “Zounds!—my good fellow,—it quite makes me—why, It really—my dear fellow—do just try Conciliation!” Stringing his nerves like flint, The sturdy butcher seized upon the hint,— At least he seized upon the foremost wether,— And hugg'd and lugg'd and tugg'd him neck and crop Just nolens volens thro' the open shop— If tails come off he didn't care a feather,— Then walking to the door and smiling grim, He rubb'd his forehead and his sleeve together— “There!—I have conciliated him!” Again—good-humouredly to end our quarrel— (Good humour should prevail!) I'll fit you with a tale, Whereto is tied a moral. Once on a time a certain English lass Was seized with symptoms of such deep decline, Cough, hectic flushes, ev'ry evil sign, That, as their wont is at such desperate pass, The Doctors gave her over—to an ass. Accordingly, the grisly Shade to bilk, Each morn the patient quaff'd a frothy bowl Of asinine new milk, Robbing a shaggy suckling of a foal Which got proportionably spare and skinny— Meanwhile the neighbours cried “poor Mary Ann! She can't get over it! she never can!” When lo! to prove each prophet was a ninny The one that died was the poor wetnurse Jenny. To aggravate the case, There were but two grown donkeys in the place; And most unluckily for Eve's sick daughter, The other long-ear'd creature was a male, Who never in his life had given a pail Of milk, or even chalk and water. No matter: at the usual hour of eight Down trots a donkey to the wicket-gate, With Mister Simon Gubbins on its back,— “Your sarvant, Miss,—a werry spring-like day,— Bad time for hasses tho'! good lack! good lack! Jenny be dead, Miss,—but I'ze brought ye Jack, He doesn't give no milk—but he can bray.” So runs the story, And, in vain self-glory, Some Saints would sneer at Gubbins for his blindness— But what the better are their pious saws To ailing souls, than dry hee-haws, Without the milk of human kindness? 1838. THE GREEN MAN. Tom Simpson was as nice a kind of man As ever lived—at least at number Four, In Austin Friars, in Mrs. Brown's first floor, At fifty pounds,—or thereabouts,—per ann. The Lady reckon'd him her best of lodgers, His rent so punctually paid each quarter,— He did not smoke like nasty foreign codgers— Or play French horns like Mr. Rogers— Or talk his flirting nonsense to her daughter,— Not that the girl was light behaved or courtable— Still on one failing tenderly to touch, The Gentleman did like a drop too much, (Tho' there are many such) And took more Port than was exactly portable. In fact,—to put the cap upon the nipple, And try the charge,—Tom certainly did tipple. He thought the motto was but sorry stuff On Cribb's Prize Cup—Yes, wrong in ev'ry letter— That “D?d be he who first cries Hold Enough!” The more cups hold, and if enough, the better. And so to set example in the eyes Of Fancy's lads, and give a broadish hint to them, All his cups were of such ample size That he got into them. Once in the company of merry mates, In spite of Temperance's ifs and buts, So sure as Eating is set off with plates, His Drinking always was bound up with cuts! Howbeit, such Bacchanalian revels Bring very sad catastrophes about; Palsy, Dyspepsy, Dropsy, and Blue Devils, Not to forget the Gout. Sometimes the liver takes a spleenful whim To grow to Strasbourg's regulation size, As if for those hepatical goose pies— Or out of depth the head begins to swim— Poor Simpson! what a thing occurred to him! 'Twas Christmas—he had drunk the night before,— Like Baxter, who so “went beyond his last”— One bottle more, and then one bottle more, Till, oh! the red-wine Ruby-con was pass'd! And homeward, by the short small chimes of day, With many a circumbendibus to spare, For instance, twice round Finsbury Square, To use a fitting phrase, he wound his way. Then comes the rising, with repentance bitter, And all the nerves—(and sparrows)—in a twitter, Till settled by the sober Chinese cup: The hands, o'er all, are members that make motions, A sort of wavering, just like the ocean's, Which has its swell, too, when it's getting up— An awkward circumstance enough for elves Who shave themselves; And Simpson just was ready to go thro' it, When lo! the first short glimpse within the glass— He jump'd—and who alive would fail to do it?— To see, however it had come to pass, One section of his face as green as grass! In vain each eager wipe, With soap—without—wet—hot or cold—or dry, Still, still, and still, to his astonished eye One cheek was green, the other cherry ripe! Plump in the nearest chair he sat him down, Quaking, and quite absorb'd in a deep study,— But verdant and not brown,— What could have happened to a tint so ruddy? Indeed it was a very novel case, By way of penalty for being jolly, To have that evergreen stuck in his face. Just like the windows with their Christmas holly. “All claret marks,”—thought he—Tom knew his forte— “Are red—this colour cannot come from Port!” One thing was plain; with such a face as his, 'Twas quite impossible to ever greet Good Mrs. Brown; nay, any party meet, Altho' 'twas such a parti-coloured phiz! As for the public, fancy Sarcy Ned, The coachman, flying, dog-like, at his head, With “Ax your pardon, Sir, but if you please— Unless it comes too high— Vere ought a fellow, now, to go to buy The t'other half, Sir, of that 'ere green cheese?” His mind recoil'd—so he tied up his head, As with a raging tooth, and took to bed; Of course with feelings far from the serene, For all his future prospects seemed to be, To match his customary tea, Black, mixt with green. Meanwhile, good Mrs. Brown Wondered at Mr. S. not coming down, And sent the maid up-stairs to learn the why; To whom poor Simpson, half delirious, Returned an answer so mysterious That curiosity began to fry; The more, as Betty, who had caught a snatch By peeping in upon the patient's bed, Reported a most bloody, tied-up head, Got over-night of course—“Harm watch, harm catch,” From Watchmen in a boxing-match. So, liberty or not,— Good lodgers are too scarce to let them off in A suicidal coffin— The dame ran up as fast as she could trot; “Appearance,—fiddlesticks!” should not deter From going to the bed, And looking at the head: “La! Mister S?, he need not care for her! A married woman that had had Nine boys and gals, and none had turned out bad— Her own dear late would come home late at night, And liquor always got him in a sight. She'd been in hospitals—she wouldn't faint At gores and gashes fingers wide and deep; She knew what's good for bruises and what ain't— Turlington's Drops she made a p'int to keep. Cases she'd seen beneath the surgent's hand— Such skulls japann'd—she meant to say trepann'd! Poor wretches! you would think they'd been in battle, And hadn't hours to live, From tearing horses' kicks or Smithfield cattle, Shamefully over-driv!— Heads forced to have a silver plate atop, To get the brains to stop. At imputations of the legs she'd been, And neither screech'd nor cried— Hereat she pluck'd the white cravat aside, And lo! the whole phenomenon was seen— “Preserve us all! He's going to gangrene!” Alas! through Simpson's brain Shot the remark, like ball, with mortal pain; It tallied truly with his own misgiving, And brought a groan, To move a heart of stone— A sort of farewell to the land of living! And as the case was imminent and urgent, He did not make a shadow of objection To Mrs. B.'s proposal for a “surgent,” But merely gave a sigh of deep dejection, While down the verdant cheek a tear of grief Stole, like a dew-drop on a cabbage-leaf. Swift flew the summons,—it was life or death! And in as short a time as he could race it, Came Doctor Puddicome, as short of breath, To try his Latin charms against Hic Jacet. He took a seat beside the patient's bed, Saw tongue—felt pulse—examined the bad cheek,— Poked, stroked, pinch'd, kneaded it—hemm'd—shook his head— Took a long solemn pause the cause to seek, (Thinking, it seem'd, in Greek,) Then ask'd—'twas Christmas—“Had he eaten grass, Or greens—and if the cook was so improper To boil them up with copper, Or farthings made of brass; Or if he drank his Hock from dark green glass, Or dined at City Festivals, whereat There's turtle, and green fat?” To all of which, with serious tone of woe, Poor Simpson answered “No.” Indeed he might have said in form auricular, Supposing Puddicome had been a monk— He had not eaten (he had only drunk) Of any thing “Particular.” The Doctor was at fault; A thing so new quite brought him to a halt. Cases of other colours came in crowds, He could have found their remedy, and soon; But green—it sent him up among the clouds, As if he had gone up with Green's balloon! Black with Black Jaundice he had seen the skin; From Yellow Jaundice yellow, From saffron tints to sallow;— Then retrospective memory lugg'd in Old Purple Face, the Host at Kentish Town— East Indians, without number, He knew familiarly, by heat done Brown, From tan to a burnt umber, Ev'n those eruptions he had never seen Of which the Caledonian Poet spoke, As “rashes growing green!” “Phoo! phoo! a rash grow green! Nothing of course but a broad Scottish joke!’ Then as to flaming visages, for those The Scarlet Fever answer'd, or the Rose— But verdant! that was quite a novel stroke! Men turn'd to blue, by Cholera's last stage, In common practice he had really seen; But Green—he was too old, and grave, and sage, To think of the last stage to Turnham Green! So matters stood in-doors—meanwhile without, Growing in going like all other rumours, The modern miracle was buzz'd about, By people of all humours, Native or foreign in their dialecticals; Till all the neighbourhood, as if their noses Had taken the odd gross from little Moses, Seem'd looking thro' green spectacles. “Green faces!” so they all began to comment— “Yes—opposite to Druggist's lighted shops, But that's a flying colour—never stops— A bottle-green that's vanish'd in a moment. Green! nothing of the sort occurs to mind, Nothing at all to match the present piece; Jack in the Green has nothing of the kind— Green-grocers are not green—nor yet green geese!” The oldest Supercargoes or Old Sailors Of such a case had never heard, From Emerald Isle to Cape de Verd; “Or Greenland!” cried the whalers. All tongues were full of the Green man, and still They could not make him out, with all their skill; No soul could shape the matter, head or tail— But Truth steps in where all conjectures fail. A long half hour, in needless puzzle, Our Galen's cane had rubbed against his muzzle; He thought, and thought, and thought, and thought, and thought— And still it came to nought, When up rush'd Betty, loudest of Town Criers, “Lord, Ma'am, the new Police is at the door! It's B, ma'am, Twenty-four,— As brought home Mr. S. to Austin Friars, And says there's nothing but a simple case— He got that 'ere green face By sleeping in the kennel near the Dyer's!” HIT OR MISS. “Twa dogs, that were na thrang at hame, Forgather'd ance upon a time.” —Burns. One morn—it was the very morn September's sportive month was born— The hour, about the sunrise, early: The sky grey, sober, still, and pearly, With sundry orange streaks and tinges Through daylight's door, at cracks and hinges; The air, calm, bracing, freshly cool, As if just skimm'd from off a pool; The scene, red, russet, yellow, leaden, From stubble, fern, and leaves that deaden, Save here and there a turnip patch, Too verdant with the rest to match; And far a-field a hazy figure, Some roaming lover of the trigger. Meanwhile the level light perchance Pick'd out his barrel with a glance; For all around a distant popping Told birds were flying off or dropping. Such was the morn—a morn right fair To seek for covey or for hare— When, lo! too far from human feet For even Ranger's boldest beat, A Dog, as in some doggish trouble, Came cant'ring through the crispy stubble, With dappled head in lowly droop, But not the scientific stoop; And flagging, dull, desponding ears, As if they had been soaked in tears, And not the beaded dew that hung The filmy stalks and weeds among. His pace, indeed, seemed not to know An errand, why, or where to go, To trot, to walk, or scamper swift— In short, he seemed a dog adrift; His very tail, a listless thing, With just an accidental swing, Like rudder to the ripple veering, When nobody on board is steering. So, dull and moody, cantered on Our vagrant pointer, christen'd Don; When, rising o'er a gentle slope, That gave his view a better scope, He spied, some dozen furrows distant, But in a spot as inconsistent, A second dog across his track, Without a master to his back; As if for wages, workman-like, The sporting breed had made a strike, Resolved nor birds nor puss to seek, Without another paunch a week! This other was a truant curly, But, for a spaniel, wondrous surly; Instead of curvets gay and brisk, He slouched along without a frisk, With dogged air, as if he had A good half mind to running mad; Mayhap the shaking at his ear Had been a quaver too severe; Mayhap the whip's “exclusive dealing” Had too much hurt e'en spaniel feeling, Nor if he had been cut, 'twas plain He did not mean to come again. Of course the pair soon spied each other; But neither seemed to own a brother; The course on both sides took a curve, As dogs when shy are apt to swerve; But each o'er back and shoulder throwing A look to watch the other's going, Till, having cleared sufficient ground, With one accord they turned them round, And squatting down, for forms not caring At one another fell to staring; As if not proof against a touch Of what plagues humankind so much, A prying itch to get at notions Of all their neighbour's looks and motions. Sir Don at length was first to rise— The better dog in point of size, And, snuffing all the ground between, Set off, with easy jaunty mien; While Dash, the stranger, rose to greet him, And made a dozen steps to meet him— Their noses touch'd, and rubbed awhile (Some savage nations use the style), And then their tails a wag began, Though on a very cautious plan, But in their signals quantum suff. To say, “A civil dog enough.” Thus having held out olive branches, They sank again, though not on haunches, But couchant, with their under jaws Resting between the two forepaws, The prelude, on a luckier day, Or sequel, to a game of play: But now they were in dumps, and thus Began their worries to discuss, The Pointer, coming to the point The first, on times so out of joint. “Well, Friend,—so here's a new September, As fine a first as I remember; And, thanks to such an early Spring, Plenty of birds, and strong on wing.” “Birds!” cried the little crusty chap, As sharp and sudden as a snap, “A weasel suck them in the shell! What matter birds, or flying well, Or fly at all, or sporting weather, If fools with guns can't hit a feather!” “Ay, there's the rub, indeed,” said Don, Putting his gravest visage on; “In vain we beat our beaten way, And bring our organs into play, Unless the proper killing kind Of barrel tunes are played behind: But when we shoot—that's me and Squire— We hit as often as we fire.” “More luck for you!” cried little Woolly, Who felt the cruel contrast fully; “More luck for you, and Squire to boot! We miss as often as we shoot!” “Indeed!—No wonder you're unhappy! I thought you looking rather snappy; But fancied, when I saw you jogging, You'd had an overdose of flogging; Or p'rhaps the gun its range had tried While you were ranging rather wide.” “Me! running—running wide—and hit! Me shot! what pepper'd?—Deuce a bit! I almost wish I had! That Dunce, My master, then would hit for once! Hit me! Lord how you talk! why zounds! He couldn't hit a pack of hounds!” “Well, that must be a case provoking. What never—but, you dog, you're joking! I see a sort of wicked grin About your jaw you're keeping in.” “A joke! an old tin kettle's clatter Would be as much a joking matter. To tell the truth, that dog-disaster Is just the type of me and master, When fagging over hill and dale, With his vain rattle at my tail. Bang, bang, and bang, the whole day's run, But leading nothing but his gun— The very shot, I fancy, hisses, It's sent upon such awful misses!” “Of course it does! But perhaps the fact is Your master's hand is out of practice!” “Practice?—No doctor, where you will, Has finer—but he cannot kill! These three years past, thro' furze and furrow, All covers I have hunted thorough; Flush'd cocks and snipes about the moors; And put up hares by scores and scores; Coveys of birds, and lots of pheasants;— Yes, game enough to send in presents To ev'ry friend he has in town, Provided he had knock'd it down: But no—the whole three years together, He has not giv'n me flick or feather— For all that I have had to do I wish I had been missing too!” “Well,—such a hand would drive me mad; But is he truly quite so bad?” “Bad!—worse!—you cannot underscore him; If I could put up, just before him, The great Balloon that paid the visit Across the water, he would miss it! Bite him! I do believe, indeed, It's in his very blood and breed! It marks his life, and runs all through it; What can be miss'd, he's sure to do it. Last Monday he came home to Tooting, Dog-tired, as if he'd been a-shooting, And kicks at me to vent his rage— ‘Get out!’ says he—‘I've miss'd the stage!’ Of course, thought I—what chance of hitting? You'd miss the Norwich waggon, sitting!” “Why, he must be the county's scoff! He ought to leave, and not let, off! As fate denies his shooting wishes, Why don't he take to catching fishes? Or any other sporting game, That don't require a bit of aim?” “Not he!—Some dogs of human kind Will hunt by sight, because they're blind. My master angle!—no such luck! There he might strike, who never struck! My master shoots because he can't, And has an eye that aims aslant; Nay, just by way of making trouble, He's changed his single gun for double; And now, as girls a-walking do, His misses go by two and two! I wish he had the mange, or reason As good, to miss the shooting season!” “Why yes, it must be main unpleasant To point to covey, or to pheasant; For snobs, who, when the point is mooting, Think letting fly as good as shooting!” “Snobs!—if he'd wear his ruffled shirts, Or coats with water-wagtail skirts, Or trowsers in the place of smalls, Or those tight fits he wears at balls, Or pumps, and boots with tops, mayhap, Why we might pass for Snip and Snap, And shoot like blazes! fly or sit, And none would stare, unless we hit. But no—to make the more combustion, He goes in gaiters and in fustian, Like Captain Ross, or Topping Sparks, And deuce a miss but some one marks! For Keepers, shy of such encroachers, Dog us about like common poachers! Many's the covey I've gone by, When underneath a sporting eye; Many a puss I've twigg'd, and pass'd her— I miss 'em to prevent my master!” “And so should I, in such a case! There's nothing feels so like disgrace, Or gives you such a scurvy look— A kick and pail of slush from Cook, Cleftsticks, or Kettle, all in one, As standing to a missing gun! It's whirr! and bang! and off you bound, To catch your bird before the ground; But no—a pump and ginger pop As soon would get a bird to drop! So there you stand, quite struck a-heap, Till all your tail is gone to sleep; A sort of stiffness in your nape, Holding your head well up to gape; While off go birds across the ridges, First small as flies, and then as midges, Cocksure, as they are living chicks, Death's Door is not at Number Six!” “Yes! yes! and then you look at master, The cause of all the late disaster, Who gives a stamp, and raps an oath At gun, or birds, or maybe both; P'raps curses you, and all your kin, To raise the hair upon your skin! Then loads, rams down, and fits new caps, To go and hunt for more miss-haps!” “Yes! yes! but, sick and sad, you feel But one long wish to go to heel; You cannot scent, for cutting mugs— Your nose is turning up, like Pug's; You can't hold up, but plod and mope; Your tail like sodden end of rope, That o'er a wind-bound vessel's side Has soak'd in harbour, tide and tide. On thorns and scratches, till, that moment Unnoticed, you begin to comment; You never felt such bitter brambles, Such heavy soil, in all your rambles! You never felt your fleas so vicious! Till, sick of life so unpropitious, You wish at last, to end the passage, That you were dead, and in your sassage!” “Yes! that's a miss from end to end! But, zounds! you draw so well, my friend, You've made me shiver, skin and gristle, As if I heard my master's whistle! Though how you came to learn the knack— I thought your squire was quite a crack!” “And so he is!—He always hits— And sometimes hard, and all to bits. But ere with him our tongues we task, I've still one little thing to ask; Namely, with such a random master, Of course you sometimes want a plaster? Such missing hands make game of more Than ever passed for game before— A pounded pig—a widow's cat— A patent ventilating hat— For shot, like mud, when thrown so thick, Will find a coat whereon to stick!” “What! accidentals, as they're term'd? No never—none—since I was worm'd— Not e'en the Keeper's fatted calves,— My master does not miss by halves! His shot are like poor orphans, hurl'd Abroad upon the whole wide world,— But whether they be blown to dust, As often-times I think they must, Or melted down too near the sun, What comes of them is known to none— I never found, since I could bark, A Barn that bore my master's mark!” “Is that the case?—why then, my brother, Would we could swap with one another! Or take the Squire, with all my heart, Nay, all my liver, so we part! He'll hit you hares—(he uses cartridge) He'll hit you cocks—he'll hit a partridge; He'll hit a snipe—he'll hit a pheasant; He'll hit—he'll hit whatever's present; He'll always hit,—as that's your wish— His pepper never lacks a dish!” “Come, come, you banter,—let's be serious; I'm sure that I am half delirious, Your picture set me so a-sighing— But does he shoot so well—shoot flying?” “Shoot flying? Yes—and running, walking,— I've seen him shoot two farmers talking— He'll hit the game, whene'er he can, But failing that he'll hit a man,— A boy—a horse's tail or head— Or make a pig a pig of lead,— Oh, friend! they say no dog as yet, However hot, was known to sweat, But sure I am that I perspire Sometimes before my master's fire! Misses! no, no, he always hits, But so as puts me into fits! He shot my fellow dog this morning, Which seemed to me sufficient warning!” “Quite, quite, enough!—So that's a hitter! Why, my own fate I thought was bitter, And full excuse for cut and run; But give me still the missing gun! Or rather, Sirius! send me this, No gun at all, to hit or miss, Since sporting seems to shoot thus double, That right or left it brings us trouble!” So ended Dash;—and Pointer Don Prepared to urge the moral on; But here a whistle long and shrill Came sounding o'er the council hill, And starting up, as if their tails, Had felt the touch of shoes and nails, Away they scamper'd down the slope, As fast as other pairs elope,— Resolv'd, instead of sporting rackets, To beg, or dance in fancy jackets; At butchers' shops to try their luck; To help to draw a cart or truck; Or lead Stone Blind poor men, at most Who would but hit or miss a post. 1839. A TABLE OF ERRATA. (Hostess loquitur.) Well! thanks be to Heaven, The summons is given; It's only gone seven And should have been six; There's fine overdoing In roasting and stewing, And victuals past chewing To rags and to sticks! How dreadfully chilly! I shake, willy-nilly That John is so silly And never will learn! This plate is a cold one, That cloth is an old one, I wish they had told one The lamp wouldn't burn. Now then for some blunder, For nerves to sink under; I never shall wonder Whatever goes ill. That fish is a riddle! It's broke in the middle. A Turbot! a fiddle! It's only a Brill! It's quite over-boil'd too, The butter is oil'd too, The soup is all spoil'd too, It's nothing but slop. The smelts looking flabby, The soles are as dabby, It all is so shabby, That Cook shall not stop! As sure as the morning, She gets a month's warning, My orders for scorning— There's nothing to eat! I hear such a rushing, I feel such a fushing, I know I am blushing As red as a beet! Friends flatter and flatter, I wish they would chatter; What can be the matter That nothing comes next? How very unpleasant! Lord! there is the pheasant! Not wanted at present,— I'm born to be vext! The pudding brought on too! And aiming at ton too! And where is that John too, The plague that he is? He's off on some ramble: And there is Miss Campbell, Enjoying the scramble, Detestable Quiz! The veal they all eye it, But no one will try it, An Ogre would shy it So ruddy as that! And as for the mutton, The cold dish it's put on, Converts to a button Each drop of the fat. The beef without mustard! My fate's to be fluster'd, And there comes the custard To eat with the hare! Such flesh, fowl, and fishing, Such waiting and dishing, I cannot help wishing A woman might swear! Oh dear! did I ever— But no, I did never— Well, come, that is clever, To send up the brawn! That cook, I could scold her, Gets worse as she's older; I wonder who told her That woodcocks are drawn! It's really audacious! I cannot look gracious, Lord help the voracious, That came for a cram! There's Alderman Fuller Gets duller and duller. Those fowls, by the colour, Were boil'd with the ham! Well, where is the curry? I'm all in a flurry. No, cook's in no hurry— A stoppage again! And John makes it wider, A pretty provider! By bringing up cider Instead of champagne! My troubles come faster! There's my lord and master Detects each disaster, And hardly can sit: He cannot help seeing, All things disagreeing; If he begins d?ing I'm off in a fit! This cooking?—it's messing! The spinach wants pressing, And salads in dressing Are best with good eggs. And John—yes, already— Has had something heady, That makes him unsteady In keeping his legs. How shall I get through it! I never can do it, I'm quite looking to it To sink by and by. Oh! would I were dead now, Or up in my bed now, To cover my head now And have a good cry! ALL ROUND MY HAT. A NEW VERSION. “Meditate—meditate I beseech you, upon Trim's hat.” Tristram Shandy. Come, my old hat, my steps attend! However wags may sneer and scoff, My castor still shall be my friend, For I'll not be a caster-off. So take again your olden place, That always found you fit and pat, Whatever mode might please the race All round my hat, all round my hat! All round the world while I've a head, However I may chance to be Without a home—without a shed, My tile shall be a roof to me. Black, rusty grey, devoid of pelt, A shocking shape or beaten flat, Still there are joys that may be felt All round my hat, all round my hat! The Quaker loves an ample brim, A hat that bows to no salaam— And dear the beaver is to him As if it never made a dam. All men in drab he calleth friends; But there's a broader brim than that— Give me the love that comprehends All round my hat, all round my hat! The Monarch binds his brows in gold, With gems and pearls to sparkle there; But still a hat, a hat that's old, They say is much more easy wear. At regal state I'll not repine For Kaiser, King, or Autocrat, Whilst there's a golden sun to shine All round my hat, all round my hat! The Soldier seeks the field of death, He fights, he fires, he faints, he falls,— To gain an airy laurel wreath, With berries made of musket balls. No love have I for shot and shell, With hissings sharp that end in flat— Chafers and gnats sing just as well All round my hat, all round my hat! As yet, my hat, you've got a crown; A little nap the brush can find; You are not very, very brown, Nor very much scrubb'd up behind. As yet your brim is broad and brave, I took some little care of that, By not saluting ev'ry knave All round my hat, all round my hat! As yet, my hat, I've got a house, And dine as other people do, And fate propitious still allows A home for me—a peg for you. But say my bread were but a crumb, Myself as poor as any rat— Why, I could cry, “Good people, come All round my hat, all round my hat!” As yet the best of womankind Continues all that wife should be, And in the self-same room I find, Her bonnet and my hat agree. But say the bliss should not endure, That she should turn a perfect cat, I'd trust to time to bring a cure All round my hat, all round my hat! No acres broad pertain to me To furnish cattle, coal, or corn; Like people that are born at sea, There was no land, where I was born:— Yet, when my flag of life is furl'd— What landlord can do more than that?— I'll leave my heir the whole wide world All round my hat, all round my hat! BEN BLUFF. A PATHETIC BALLAD. “Pshaw, you are not on a whaling voyage, where everything that offers is game.” —The Pilot. Ben Bluff was a whaler, and many a day Had chased the huge fish about Baffin's old Bay; But time brought a change his diversion to spoil, And that was when Gas took the shine out of Oil. He turn'd up his nose at the fumes of the coke, And swore the whole scheme was a bottle of smoke: As to London he briefly deliver'd his mind, “Sparma-city,” said he—but the City declined. So Ben cut his line in a sort of a huff, As soon as his Whales had brought profits enough, And hard by the Docks settled down for his life, But, true to his text, went to Wales for a wife. A big one she was, without figure or waist, More bulky than lovely, but that was his taste; In fat she was lapp'd from her sole to her crown, And, turn'd into oil would have lighted a town. But Ben like a Whaler was charm'd with the match, And thought, very truly, his spouse a great catch; A flesh-and-blood emblem of Plenty and Peace, And would not have changed her for Helen of Greece. For Greenland was green in his memory still; He'd quitted his trade, but retain'd the good-will; And often, when soften'd by bumbo and flip, Would cry—till he blubber'd—about his old ship. No craft like the Grampus could work through a floe, What knots she could run, and what tons she could stow! And then that rich smell he preferr'd to the rose, By just nosing the hold without holding his nose! Now Ben he resolved, one fine Saturday night, A snug Arctic Circle of friends to invite, Old Tars in the trade, who related old tales, And drank, and blew clouds that were “very like whales.” Of course with their grog there was plenty of chat Of canting, and flenching, and cutting up fat; And how Gun Harpoons into fashion had got, And if they were meant for the Gun-whale or not? At last they retired, and left Ben to his rest, By fancies cetaceous, and drink, well possess'd, When, lo! as he lay by his partner in bed, He heard something blow through two holes in its head! “A start!” mutter'd Ben, in the Grampus afloat, And made but one jump from the deck to the boat! “Huzza! pull away for the blubber and bone— I look on that whale as already my own!” Then groping about by the light of the moon, He soon laid his hand on his trusty harpoon; A moment he poised it, to send it more pat, And then made a plunge to imbed it in fat! “Starn all!” he sang out, “as you care for your lives— Starn all, as you hope to return to your wives— Stand by for the flurry! she throws up the foam! Well done, my old iron, I've sent you right home!” And scarce had he spoken, when lo! bolt upright The Leviathan rose in a great sheet of white, And swiftly advanced for a fathom or two, As only a fish out of water could do. “Starn all!” echoed Ben, with a movement aback, But too slow to escape from the creature's attack; If flippers it had, they were furnish'd with nails,— “You willin, I'll teach you that Women an't Whales!’ “Avast!” shouted Ben, with a sort of a screech, “I've heard a Whale spouting, but here is a speech!” “A-spouting, indeed!—very pretty,” said she; “But it's you I'll blow up, not the froth of the sea! “To go to pretend to take me for a fish! You great Polar Bear—but I know what you wish— You're sick of a wife, that your hankering baulks,— You want to go back to some young Esquimaux!” “O dearest,” cried Ben, frighten'd out of his life, “Don't think I would go for to murder a wife I must long have bewail'd”—But she only cried “Stuff! Don't name it, you brute, you've be-whaled me enough!” “Lord, Polly!” said Ben, “such a deed could I do? I'd rather have murder'd all Wapping than you! Come, forgive what is passed.” “Oh you monster!” she cried, “It was none of your fault that it passed of one side!” However, at last she inclined to forgive: “But, Ben, take this warning as long as you live— If the love of harpooning so strong must prevail, Take a whale for a wife, not a wife for a whale.” A PLAIN DIRECTION. “Do you never deviate?” —John Bull. In London once I lost my way In faring to and fro, And ask'd a little ragged boy The way that I should go; He gave a nod, and then a wink, And told me to get there “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I box'd his little saucy ears, And then away I strode; But since I've found that weary path Is quite a common road. Utopia is a pleasant place, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the square.” I've read about a famous town That drove a famous trade, Where Whittington walk'd up and found A fortune ready made. The very streets are paved with gold; But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've read about a Fairy Land, In some romantic tale, Where Dwarfs, if good, are sure to thrive, And wicked Giants fail. My wish is great, my shoes are strong, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've heard about some happy Isle, Where ev'ry man is free, And none can lie in bonds for life For want of L. S. D. Oh that's the land of Liberty! But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've dreamt about some blessed spot, Beneath the blessed sky, Where Bread and Justice never rise Too dear for folks to buy. It's cheaper than the Ward of Cheap, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” They say there is an ancient House, As pure as it is old, Where Members always speak their minds, And votes are never sold. I'm fond of all antiquities, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” They say there is a Royal Court Maintain'd in noble state, When ev'ry able man, and good, Is certain to be great! I'm very fond of seeing sights, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” They say there is a Temple too, Where Christians come to pray; But canting knaves and hypocrites, And bigots keep away. O! that's the parish church for me! But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” They say there is a Garden fair, That's haunted by the dove, Where love of gold doth ne'er eclipse The golden light of love— The place must be a Paradise, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've heard there is a famous Land For public spirit known— Whose Patriots love its interests Much better than their own. The Land of Promise sure it is! But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've read about a fine Estate, A Mansion large and strong; A view all over Kent and back, And going for a song. George Robins knows the very spot, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've heard there is a Company All formal and enroll'd, Will take your smallest silver coin And give it back in gold. Of course the office door is mobb'd, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” I've heard about a pleasant land, Where omelettes grow on trees, And roasted pigs run, crying out, “Come eat me, if you please.” My appetite is rather keen, But how shall I get there? “Straight down the Crooked Lane, And all round the Square.” THE BACHELOR'S DREAM. My pipe is lit, my grog is mix'd, My curtains drawn and all is snug; Old Puss is in her elbow-chair, And Tray is sitting on the rug. Last night I had a curious dream; Miss Susan Bates was Mistress Mogg— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? She look'd so fair, she sang so well, I could but woo and she was won, Myself in blue, the bride in white, The ring was placed, the deed was done! Away we went in chaise-and-four, As fast as grinning boys could flog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? What loving tête-à-têtes to come! But tête-à-têtes must still defer! When Susan came to live with me, Her mother came to live with her! With sister Belle she couldn't part, But all my ties had leave to jog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? The mother brought a pretty Poll— A monkey too,—what work he made! The sister introduced a Beau— My Susan brought a favourite maid. She had a tabby of her own,— A snappish mongrel christen'd Gog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? The Monkey bit—the Parrot scream'd, All day the sister strumm'd and sung; The petted maid was such a scold! My Susan learn'd to use her tongue: Her mother had such wretched health, She sate and croak'd like any frog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? No longer “Deary,” “Duck,” and “Love,” I soon came down to simple “M!” The very servants cross'd my wish, My Susan let me down to them. The poker hardly seem'd my own, I might as well have been a log— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? My clothes they were the queerest shape! Such coats and hats she never met! My ways they were the oddest ways! My friends were such a vulgar set! Poor Tomkinson was snubb'd and huff'd— She could not bear that Mister Blogg— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? At times we had a spar, and then Mamma must mingle in the song— The sister took a sister's part— The Maid declared her Master wrong— The Parrot learn'd to call me “Fool!” My life was like a London fog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? My Susan's taste was superfine, As proved by bills that had no end— I never had a decent coat— I never had a coin to spend! She forced me to resign my Club, Lay down my pipe, retrench my grog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? Each Sunday night we gave a rout To fops and flirts, a pretty list; And when I tried to steal away, I found my study full of whist! Then, first to come and last to go, There always was a Captain Hogg— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? Now was not that an awful dream For one who single is and snug— With Pussy in the elbow-chair And Tray reposing on the rug?— If I must totter down the hill, 'Tis safest done without a clog— What d'ye think of that, my Cat? What d'ye think of that, my Dog? RURAL FELICITY. Well, the country's a pleasant place, sure enough, for people that's country born, And useful, no doubt, in a natural way, for growing our grass and our corn. It was kindly meant of my cousin Giles, to write and invite me down. Tho' as yet all I've seen of a pastoral life only makes me more partial to town. At first I thought I was really come down into all sorts of rural bliss, For Porkington Place, with its cows and its pigs, and its poultry, looks not much amiss; There's something about a dairy farm, with its different kinds of live stock, That puts one in mind of Paradise, and Adam and his innocent flock; But somehow the good old Elysium fields have not been well handed down, And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear Leicester Fields up in town. To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads, and so I should like for miles, If it wasn't for clodpoles of carpenters that put up such crooked stiles; For the bars jut out, and you must jut out, till you're almost broken in two, If you clamber you're certain sure of a fall, and you stick if you try to creep through. Of course, in the end, one learns how to climb without constant tumbles-down, But still as to walking so stylishly, it's pleasanter done about town. There's a way, I know, to avoid the stiles, and that's by a walk in a lane, And I did find a very nice shady one, but I never dared go again; For who should I meet but a rampaging bull, that wouldn't be kept in the pound, A trying to toss the whole world at once, by sticking his horns in the ground? And that, by-the-bye, is another thing, that pulls rural pleasures down, Ev'ry day in the country is cattle-day, and there's only two up in town. Then I've rose with the sun, to go brushing away at the first early pearly dew, And to meet Aurory, or whatever's her name, and I always got wetted through; My shoes are like sops, and I caught a bad cold, and a nice draggle-tail to my gown, That's not the way that we bathe our feet, or wear our pearls, up in town! As for picking flowers, I have tried at a hedge, sweet eglantine roses to snatch, But, mercy on us! how nettles will sting, and how the long brambles do scratch; Beside hitching my hat on a nasty thorn that tore all the bows from the crown, One may walk long enough without hats branching off, or losing one's bows about town. But worse than that, in a long rural walk, suppose that it blows up for rain, And all at once you discover yourself in a real St. Swithin's Lane; And while you're running all duck'd and drown'd, and pelted with sixpenny drops, “Fine weather,” you hear the farmers say; “a nice growing shower for the crops!” But who's to crop me another new hat, or grow me another new gown? For you can't take a shilling fare with a plough as you do with the hackneys in town. Then my nevys too, they must drag me off to go with them gathering nuts, And we always set out by the longest way and return by the shortest cuts. Short cuts, indeed! But it's nuts to them, to get a poor lustyish aunt To scramble through gaps, or jump over a ditch, when they're morally certain she can't,— For whenever I get in some awkward scrape, and it's almost daily the case, Tho' they don't laugh out, the mischievous brats, I see the ‘hooray!’ in their face. There's the other day, for my sight is short, and I saw what was green beyond, And thought it was all terry firmer and grass, till I walked in the duckweed pond: Or perhaps when I've pully-hauled up a bank they see me come launching down, As none but a stout London female can do as is come a first time out of town. Then how sweet, some say, on a mossy bank a verdurous seat to find, But for my part I always found it a joy that brought a repentance behind; For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained a whole breadth of my gown— And when gowns are dyed, I needn't say, it's much better done up in town. As for country fare, the first morning I came I heard such a shrill piece of work! And ever since—and it's ten days ago—we've lived upon nothing but pork; One Sunday except, and then I turn'd sick, a plague take all countrified cooks! Why didn't they tell me, before I had dined, they made pigeon pies of the rooks? Then the gooseberry wine, tho' it's pleasant when up, it doesn't agree when it's down, But it served me right, like a gooseberry, fool to look for champagne out of town! To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best when he started this pastoral plan, And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she teaches me all that she can, Such as making of cheese, and curing of hams, but I'm sure that I never shall learn, And I've fetched more back-ache than butter as yet by chumping away at the churn; But in making hay, tho' it's tanning work, I found it more easy to make, But it tries one's legs, and no great relief when you're tired to sit down on the rake. I'd a country dance, too, at harvest home, with a regular country clown, But, Lord! they don't hug one round the waist and give one such smacks in town! Then I've tried to make friends with the birds and the beasts, but they take to such curious rigs, I'm always at odds with the turkey-cock, and I can't even please the pigs. The very hens pick holes in my hands when I grope for the new-laid eggs, And the gander comes hissing out of the pond on purpose to flap at my legs. I've been bump'd in a ditch by the cow without horns, and the old sow trampled me down, The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts—but they're kept in cages in town! Another thing is the nasty dogs—thro' the village I hardly can stir Since giving a bumpkin a pint of beer just to call off a barking cur; And now you would swear all the dogs in the place were set on to hunt me down, But neither the brutes nor the people I think are as civilly bred as in town. Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake, and all in a tremble of fright, But instead of a family murder it proved an owl, that flies screeching at night. Then there's plenty of ricks and stacks all about, and I can't help dreaming of Swing— In short, I think that a pastoral life is not the most happiest thing; For, besides all the troubles I've mentioned before, as endured for rurality's sake, I've been stung by the bees, and I've set among ants, and once—ugh! I trod on a snake! And as to mosquitoes, they tortured me so, for I've got a particular skin, I do think it's the gnats coming out of the ponds, that drives the poor suicides in! And after all an't there new-laid eggs to be had upon Holborn Hill? And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles, and fresh butter wherever you will? And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread quite rustical-like and brown? So one isn't so very uncountrified in the very heart of the town. Howsomever my mind's made up, and although I'm sure cousin Giles will be vext, I mean to book me an inside place up to town upon Saturday next, And if nothing happens, soon after ten, I shall be at the Old Bell and Crown, And perhaps I may come to the country again, when London is all burnt down A FLYING VISIT. “A Calendar! a Calendar! look in the Almanac, find out moonshine—find out moonshine!” —Midsummer Night's Dream. The by-gone September, As folks may remember, At least if their memory saves but an ember, One fine afternoon, There went up a Balloon, Which did not return to the Earth very soon. For, nearing the sky, At about a mile high, The Aëronaut bold had resolved on a fly; So cutting his string, In a Parasol thing, Down he came in a field like a lark from the wing. Meanwhile, thus adrift, The Balloon made a shift To rise very fast, with no burden to lift; It got very small, Then to nothing at all; And then rose the question of where it would fall? Some thought that, for lack Of the man and his pack, 'Twould rise to the Cherub that watches Poor Jack; Some held, but in vain, With the first heavy rain, 'Twould surely come down to the Gardens again! But still not a word For a month could be heard Of what had become of the Wonderful Bird: The firm Gye and Hughes, Wore their boots out and shoes, In running about and inquiring for news. Some thought it must be Tumbled into the Sea; Some thought it had gone off to High Germanie; For Germans, as shown By their writings, 'tis known Are always delighted with what is high-flown. Some hinted a bilk, And that maidens who milk, In far distant Shires would be walking in silk: Some swore that it must, “As they said at the fust, Have gone again' flashes of lightning and bust!’ However, at last, When six weeks had gone past Intelligence came of a plausible cast; A wondering clown, At a hamlet near town, Had seen “like a moon of green cheese” coming down. Soon spread the alarm, And from cottage and farm, The natives buzz'd out like the bees when they swarm; And off ran the folk,— It is such a good joke To see the descent of a bagful of smoke. And lo! the machine, Dappled yellow and green, Was plainly enough in the clouds to be seen “Yes, yes,” was the cry, “It's the old one, surely, Where can it have been such a time in the sky “Lord! where will it fall? It can't find out Vauxhall, Without any pilot to guide it at all!” Some wager'd that Kent Would behold the event, Debrett had been posed to predict its “descent.” Some thought it would pitch In the old Tower Ditch, Some swore on the Cross of St. Paul's it would hitch, And Farmers cried “Zounds! If it drops on our grounds, We'll try if Balloons can't be put into pounds!” But still to and fro It continued to go, As if looking out for soft places below— No difficult job, It had only to bob Slap-dash down at once on the heads of the mob: Who, too apt to stare At some castle in air, Forget that the earth is their proper affair; Till, watching the fall Of some soap-bubble ball, They tumble themselves with a terrible sprawl. Meanwhile, from its height Stooping downward in flight, The Phenomenon came more distinctly in sight: Still bigger and bigger, And strike me a nigger Unfreed, if there was not a live human figure! Yes, plain to be seen, Underneath the machine, There dangled a mortal—some swore it was Green; Some Mason could spy; Others named Mr. Gye; Or Hollond, compell'd by the Belgians to fly. 'Twas Graham the flighty, Whom the Duke high and mighty, Resign'd to take care of his own lignum-vitæ; 'Twas Hampton, whose whim Was in Cloudland to swim, Till e'en Little Hampton look'd little to him! But all were at fault; From the heavenly vault The falling balloon came at last to a halt; And bounce! with the jar Of descending so far, An outlandish Creature was thrown from the car! At first with the jolt All his wits made a bolt, As if he'd been flung by a mettlesome colt; And while in his faint, To avoid all complaint, The Muse shall endeavour his portrait to paint. The face of this elf, Round as platter of delf, Was pale as if only a cast of itself: His head had a rare Fleece of silvery hair, Just like the Albino at Bartlemy Fair. His eyes they were odd, Like the eyes of a cod, And gave him the look of a watery God. His nose was a snub; Under which for his grub, Was a round open mouth like to that of a chub. His person was small, Without figure at all, A plump little body as round as a ball: With two little fins, And a couple of pins, With what has been christened a bow in the shins. His dress it was new, A full suit of sky-blue— With bright silver buckles in each little shoe— Thus painted complete, From his head to his feet, Conceive him laid flat in Squire Hopkins's wheat. Fine text for the crowd! Who disputed aloud What sort of a creature had dropp'd from the cloud— “He's come from o'er seas, He's a Cochin Chinese— By jingo! he's one of the wild Cherookees!” “Don't nobody know?” “He's a young Esquimaux, Turn'd white like the hares by the Arctical snow.’ “Some angel, my dear, Sent from some upper spear For Plumtree or Agnew, too good for this-here!” Meanwhile, with a sigh, Having open'd one eye, The Stranger rose up on his seat by and by; And finding his tongue, Thus he said, or he sung, “Mi criky bo biggamy kickery bung!” “Lord! what does he speak!” “It's Dog-Latin—it's Greek!” “It's some sort of slang for to puzzle a Beak!” “It's no like the Scotch,” Said a Scot on the watch, “Phoo! it's nothing at all but a kind of hotch-potch!” “It's not parly voo,” Cried a schoolboy or two, “Nor Hebrew at all,” said a wandering Jew. Some held it was sprung From the Irvingite tongue, The same that is used by a child very young. Some guess'd it high Dutch, Others thought it had much In sound of the true Hoky-poky-ish touch; But none could be poz, What the Dickens (not Boz), No mortal could tell what the Dickens it was! When who should come pat, In a moment like that, But Bowring, to see what the people were at— A Doctor well able, Without any fable, To talk and translate all the babble of Babel. So just drawing near, With a vigilant ear, That took ev'ry syllable in, very clear, Before one could sip Up a tumbler of flip, He knew the whole tongue from the root to the tip! Then stretching his hand, As you see Daniel stand, In the Feast of Belshazzar, that picture so grand! Without more delay, In the Hamilton way He English'd whatever the Elf had to say. “Krak kraziboo ban, I'm the Lunatick Man, Confined in the Moon since creation began— Sit muggy bigog, Whom, except in a fog, You see with a Lantern, a Bush, and a Dog. “Lang sinery lear, For this many a year, I've long'd to drop in at your own little sphere,— Och, pad-mad aroon, Till one fine afternoon, I found that Wind-Coach on the horns of the Moon. “Cush quackery go, But, besides you must know, I'd heard of a profiting Prophet below; Big botherum blether, Who pretended to gather The tricks that the Moon meant to play with the weather. “So Crismus an crash, Being shortish of cash, I thought I'd a right to partake of the hash— Slik mizzle an smak, So I'm come with a pack, To sell to the trade, of my own Almanack. “Fiz, bobbery pershal, Besides aims commercial, Much wishing to honour my friend Sir John Herschel, Cum puddin and tame, It's inscribed to his name, Which is now at the full in celestial fame. “Wept wepton wish wept, Pray this Copy accept”— But here on the Stranger some Kidnappers leapt: For why? a shrewd man Had devis'd a sly plan The Wonder to grab for a show Caravan. So plotted, so done— With a fight as in fun, While mock pugilistical rounds were begun, A knave who could box, And give right and left knocks, Caught hold of the Prize by his silvery locks. And hard he had fared, But the people were scared By what the Interpreter roundly declared: “You ignorant Turks! You will be your own Burkes— He holds all the keys of the lunary works! “You'd best let him go— If you keep him below, The Moon will not change, and the tides will not flow; He left her at full, And with such a long pull, Zounds! ev'ry man Jack will run mad like a bull!” So awful a threat Took effect on the set; The fright, tho,' was more than their Guest could forget; So taking a jump, In the car he came plump, And threw all the ballast right out in a lump. Up soar'd the machine, With its yellow and green; But still the pale face of the Creature was seen, Who cried from the car, “Dam in yooman bi gar!” That is,—“What a sad set of villains you are!” Howbeit, at some height, He threw down quite a flight Of Almanacks, wishing to set us all right— And, thanks to the boon, We shall see very soon If Murphy knows most, or the Man in the Moon! STANZAS. [With the good of our country before us] With the good of our country before us, Why play the mere partisan's game? Lo! the broad flag of England is o'er us, And behold on both sides 'tis the same! Not for this, not for that, not for any, Not for these, not for those, but for all,— To the last drop of blood—the last penny— Together let's stand, or let's fall! Tear down the vile signs of a fraction, Be the national banner unfurl'd,— And if we must have any faction,— Be it “Britain against all the world.’ [Come all ye sable little girls and boys] Come all ye sable little girls and boys, Ye coal-black Brothers—Sooty Sisters, come!

THE DOCTOR. A SKETCH. “Whatever is, is right.” —Pope. There once was a Doctor, (No foe to the proctor,) A physic concocter, Whose dose was so pat, However it acted, One speech it extracted,— “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” And first, all “unaisy,” Like woman that's crazy, In flies Mistress Casey, “Do come to poor Pat The blood's running faster! He's torn off the plaster—” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” Anon, with an antic, Quite strange and romantic, A woman comes frantic— “What could you be at? My darling dear Aleck, You've sent him oxalic!” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” Then in comes another, Dispatch'd by his mother, A blubbering brother, Who gives a rat-tat— “Oh, poor little sister Has lick'd off a blister!” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” Now home comes the flunkey, His own powder-monkey, But dull as a donkey— With basket and that— “The draught for the Squire, Sir, He chuck'd in the fire, Sir—” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” The next is the pompous Head Beadle, old Bumpus— “Lord! here is a rumpus: That pauper, Old Nat, In some drunken notion Has drunk up his lotion—” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” At last comes a servant, In grief very fervent: “Alas! Doctor Derwent, Poor Master is flat! He's drawn his last breath, Sir— That dose was his death, Sir.” “Yes, yes,” said the Doctor, “I meant it for that!” THE VISION. “Plague on't! the last was ill enough, This cannot but make better proof.” —Cotton. As I sate the other night, Burning of a single light, All at once a change there came In the colour of the flame. Strange it was the blaze to view, Blue as summer sky is blue: One! two! three! four! five! six! seven! Eight! nine! ten! it struck eleven! Pale as sheet, with stiffen'd hair, Motionless in elbow chair— Blood congealing—dead almost— “Now,” thought I, “to see a ghost!” Strange misgiving, true as strange! In the air there came a change, And as plain as mortals be, Lo! a shape confronted me! Lines and features I could trace Like an old familiar face, Thin and pallid like my own, In the morning mirror shown. “Now,” he said, and near the grate Drew a chair for tête-à-tête, Quite at odds with all decorum,— “Now, my boys, let's have a jorum!” “Come,” he cried, “old fellow, come, Where's the brandy, where's the rum? Where's the kettle—is it hot? Shall we have some punch, or what?” “Feast of reason—flow of soul! Where's the sugar, where's the bowl? Lemons I will help to squeeze— Flip, Egg-hot or what you please!” “Sir,” said I, with hectic cough, Shock of nerves to carry off— Looking at him very hard, “Pray oblige me with a card.” “Card,” said he—“Phoo—nonsense—stuff! We're acquainted well enough— Still, my name if you desire, Eighteen Thirty-Eight, Esquire. “Ring for supper! where's the tray? No great time I have to stay, One short hour, and like a May'r, I must quit the yearly Chair!” Scarce could I contain my rage— O'er the retrospective page, Looking back from date to date, What I owed to Thirty-Eight. Sickness here and sickness there, Pain and sorrow, constant care; Fifty-two long weeks to fall, Nor a trump among them all! “Zounds!” I cried, in quite a huff, “Go—I've known you long enough. Seek for supper where you please, Here you have not bread and cheese.‘ “Nay,” cried he, “were things so ill? Let me have your pardon still— What I've done to give you pain I will never do again.” “As from others, so from you, Let me have my honours due; Soon the parish bells about Will begin to ring me out.” “Ring you out?—With all my heart!” From my chair I made a start, Pull'd the bell and gave a shout— “Peter, show the Old Year out!” TO MY DAUGHTER. ON HER BIRTH-DAY. Dear Fanny! nine long years ago, While yet the morning sun was low, And rosy with the Eastern glow The landscape smiled— Whilst lowed the newly-waken'd herds— Sweet as the early song of birds, I heard those first, delightful words, “Thou hast a Child!” Along with that uprising dew Tears glisten'd in my eyes, though few, To hail a dawning quite as new To me, as Time: It was not sorrow—not annoy— But like a happy maid, though coy, With grief-like welcome even Joy Forestalls its prime. So mayst thou live, dear! many years, In all the bliss that life endears, Not without smiles, nor yet from tears Too strictly kept: When first thy infant littleness I folded in my fond caress, The greatest proof of happiness Was this—I wept. MORNING MEDITATIONS. Let Taylor preach upon a morning breezy, How well to rise while nights and larks are flying— For my part getting up seems not so easy By half as lying. What if the lark does carol in the sky, Soaring beyond the sight to find him out— Wherefore am I to rise at such a fly? I'm not a trout. Talk not to me of bees and such like hums, The smell of sweet herbs at the morning prime— Only lie long enough, and bed becomes A bed of time. To me Dan Phœbus and his car are nought, His steeds that paw impatiently about,— Let them enjoy, say I, as horses ought, The first turn-out! Right beautiful the dewy meads appear Besprinkled by the rosy-finger'd girl; What then,—if I prefer my pillow-beer To early pearl? My stomach is not ruled by other men's, And grumbling for a reason, quaintly begs “Wherefore should master rise before the hens Have laid their eggs?” Why from a comfortable pillow start To see faint flushes in the east awaken? A fig, say I, for any streaky part, Excepting bacon. An early riser Mr. Gray has drawn, Who used to haste the dewy grass among, “To meet the sun upon the upland lawn”— Well—he died young. With charwomen such early hours agree, And sweeps, that earn betimes their bit and sup; But I'm no climbing boy, and need not be “All up—all up!” So here I'll lie, my morning calls deferring, Till something nearer to the stroke of noon;— A man that's fond precociously of stirring, Must be a spoon. 1840 UP THE RHINE [Verse extracted from prose narrative.] [Ye Tourists and Travellers, bound to the Rhine] Ye Tourists and Travellers, bound to the Rhine, Provided with passport, that requisite docket, First listen to one little whisper of mine— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! Don't wash or be shaved—go like hairy wild men, Play dominoes, smoke, wear a cap, and smock-frock it, But if you speak English, or look it, why then— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll sleep at great inns, in the smallest of beds, Find charges as apt to mount up as a rocket, With thirty per cent. as a tax on your heads,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll see old Cologne,—not the sweetest of towns,— Wherever you follow your nose you will shock it; And you'll pay your three dollars to look at three crowns,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll count seven Mountains, and see Roland's Eck, Hear legends veracious as any by Crockett; But oh! to the tone of romance what a check,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! Old Castles you'll see on the vine-covered hill,— Fine ruins to rivet the eye in its socket— Once haunts of Baronial Banditti, and still— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll stop at Coblenz, with its beautiful views, But make no long stay with your money to stock it, Where Jews are all Germans, and Germans all Jews,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket? A Fortress you'll see, which, as people report, Can never be captured, save famine should block it— Ascend Ehrenbreitstein—but that's not their forte,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll see an old man who'll let off an old gun, And Lurley, with her hurly-burly, will mock it; But think that the words of the echo thus run,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! You'll gaze on the Rheingau, the soil of the Vine! Of course you will freely Moselle it and Hock it— P'raps purchase some pieces of Humbugheim wine— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! Perchance you will take a frisk off to the Baths— Where some to their heads hold a pistol and cock it; But still mind the warning, wherever your paths— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! And Friendships you'll swear, most eternal of pacts, Change rings, and give hair to be put in a locket; But still, in the most sentimental of acts— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! In short, if you visit that stream or its shore, Still keep at your elbow one caution to knock it, And where Schinderhannes was Robber of yore,— Take care of your pocket!—take care of your pocket! TO ????? WITH A FLASK OF RHINE WATER. The old Catholic City was still, In the Minster the vespers were sung, And, re-echoed in cadences shrill, The last call of the trumpet had rung; While, across the broad stream of the Rhine, The full Moon cast a silvery zone; And, methought, as I gazed on its shine, “Surely that is the Eau de Cologne.” I inquired not the place of its source, If it ran to the east or the west; But my heart took a note of its course, That it flow'd towards Her I love best— That it flow'd towards Her I love best, Like those wandering thoughts of my own, And the fancy such sweetness possess'd, That the Rhine seemed all Eau de Cologne! THE ROMANCE OF COLOGNE. 'Tis even—on the pleasant banks of Rhine The thrush is singing, and the dove is cooing, A youth and maiden on the turf recline Alone—And he is wooing. Yet woos in vain, for to the voice of love No kindly sympathy the Maid discovers, Though round them both, and in the air above, The tender Spirit hovers! Untouch'd by lovely Nature and her laws, The more he pleads, more coyly she represses;— Her lips denies, and now her hand withdraws, Rejecting his caresses. Fair is she as the dreams young poets weave, Bright eyes, and dainty lips, and tresses curly; In outward loveliness a child of Eve, But cold as Nymph of Lurley! The more Love tries her pity to engross, The more she chills him with a strange behaviour; Now tells her beads, now gazes on the Cross And Image of the Saviour. Forth goes the Lover with a farewell moan, As from the presence of a thing inhuman;— Oh! what unholy spell hath turn'd to stone The young warm heart of Woman! 'Tis midnight—and the moonbeam, cold and wan, On bower and river quietly is sleeping, And o'er the corse of a self-murdered man The Maiden fair is weeping. In vain she looks into his glassy eyes, No pressure answers to her hand so pressing; In her fond arms impassively he lies, Clay-cold to her caressing. Despairing, stunn'd by her eternal loss, She flies to succour that may best beseem her; But, lo! a frowning Figure veils the Cross, And hides the blest Redeemer! With stern right hand it stretches forth a scroll, Wherein she reads in melancholy letters, The cruel fatal pact that placed her soul And her young heart in fetters. “Wretch! Sinner! Renegade! to truth and God, Thy holy faith for human love to barter!” No more she hears, but on the bloody sod Sinks, Bigotry's last Martyr! And side by side the hapless Lovers lie: Tell me, harsh priest! by yonder tragic token, What part hath God in such a Bond, whereby Or hearts or vows are broken? [“I like your German singers well] “I like your German singers well, But hate them too, and for this reason, Although they always sing in time, They often sing quite out of season.”</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME V. 1840. [Continued.] UP THE RHINE [Verse extracted from prose narrative.] [Continued.] THE KNIGHT AND THE DRAGON. In the famous old times, (Famed for chivalrous crimes) As the legends of Rhineland deliver, Once there flourished a Knight, Who Sir Otto was hight, On the banks of the rapid green river! On the Drachenfels' crest He had built a stone nest, From which he pounced down like a vulture, And with talons of steel Out of every man's meal Took a very extortionate multure. Yet he lived in good fame, With a nobleman's name, As “Your High-and-well-born” address'd daily— Though Judge Park in his wig Would have deemed him a prig, Or a cracksman, if tried at th' Old Bailey. It is strange—very strange! How opinions will change!— How antiquity blazons and hallows Both the man, and the crime, That a less lapse of time Would commend to the hulks or the gallows! Thus enthrall'd by Romance, In a mystified trance, E'en a young, mild, and merciful woman Will recal with delight The wild keep, and its Knight, Who was quite as much tiger as human! Now it chanced on a day, In the sweet month of May, From his casement Sir Otto was gazing, With his sword in the sheath, At that prospect beneath, Which our tourists declare so amazing! Yes—he gazed on the Rhine, And its banks, so divine; Yet with no admiration or wonder, But the goût of a thief, As a more modern chief Looked on London, and cried “What a plunder!” From that river so fast, From that champaign so vast, He collected rare tribute and presents; Water-rates from ships' loads, Highway-rates on the roads, And hard poor-rates from all the poor peasants! When behold! round the base Of his strong dwelling-place, Only gained by most toilsome progression, He perceived a full score Of the rustics, or more, Winding up in a sort of procession! “Keep them out!” the Knight cried, To the warders outside— But the hound at his feet gave a grumble! And in scrambled the knaves, Like feudality's slaves, With all forms that are servile and humble. “Now for boorish complaints! Grant me patience, ye Saints!” Cried the Knight, turning red as a mullet; When the baldest old man Thus his story began, With a guttural croak in his gullet! “Lord supreme of our lives, Of our daughters, our wives, Our she-cousins, our sons, and their spouses, Of our sisters and aunts, Of the babies God grants, Of the handmaids that dwell in our houses! “Mighty master of all We possess, great or small, Of our cattle, our sows, and their farrows; Of our mares and their colts, Of our crofts, and our holts, Of our ploughs, of our wains, and our harrows! “Noble Lord of the soil, Of its corn and its oil, Of its wine, only fit for such gentles! Of our cream and sour-kraut, Of our carp and our trout, Our black bread, and black puddings, and lentils! “Sovran Lord of our cheese, And whatever you please— Of our bacon, our eggs, and our butter, Of our backs and our polls, Of our bodies and souls— O give ear to the woes that we utter! “We are truly perplex'd, We are frighted and vex'd, Till the strings of our hearts are all twisted; We are ruined and curst By the fiercest and worst Of all robbers that ever existed!” “Now by Heav'n and this light!” In a rage cried the Knight, “For this speech all your bodies shall stiffen! What! by Peasants miscall'd!” Quoth the man that was bald, “Not your Honour we mean, but a Griffin. “For our herds and our flocks He lays wait in the rocks, And jumps forth without giving us warning; Two poor wethers, right fat, And four lambs after that, Did he swallow this very May morning!” Then the High-and-well-born Gave a laugh as in scorn, “Is the Griffin indeed such a glutton? Let him eat up the rams, And the lambs, and theirs dams— If I hate any meat, it is mutton!” “Nay, your Worship,” said then The most bald of old men, “For a sheep we would hardly thus cavil, If the merciless Beast Did not oftentimes feast On the Pilgrims, and people that travel.” “Feast on what,” cried the Knight, Whilst his eye glisten'd bright With the most diabolical flashes— “Does the Beast dare to prey On the road and highway? With our proper diversion that clashes!” “Yea, 'tis so, and far worse,” Said the Clown, “to our curse; For by way of a snack or a tiffin, Every week in the year Sure as Sundays appear, A young virgin is thrown to the Griffin!” “Ha! Saint Peter! Saint Mark!” Roar'd the Knight, frowning dark, With an oath that was awful and bitter: “A young maid to his dish! Why, what more could he wish, If the Beast were High-born, and a Ritter! “Now, by this our good brand, And by this our right hand, By the badge that is borne on our banners, If we can but once meet With the monster's retreat, We will teach him to poach on our manors!” Quite content with this vow, With a scrape and a bow, The glad peasants went home to their flagons, Where they tippled so deep, That each clown in his sleep Dreamt of killing a legion of dragons! Thus engaged, the bold Knight Soon prepared for the fight With the wily and scaly marauder; But, ere battle began, Like a good Christian man, First he put all his household in order. “Double bolted and barr'd Let each gate have a guard”— (Thus his rugged Lieutenant was bidden) “And be sure, without fault, No one enters the vault Where the Church's gold vessels are hidden. “In the dark oubliette Let yon merchant forget That he e'er had a bark richly laden— And that desperate youth, Our own rival forsooth! Just indulge with a kiss of the Maiden! “Crush the thumbs of the Jew With the vice and the screw, Till he tells where he buried his treasure; And deliver our word To yon sullen caged bird, That to-night she must sing for our pleasure!” Thereupon, cap-à-pie, As a champion should be, With the bald-headed peasant to guide him, On his war-horse he bounds, And then, whistling his hounds, Prances off to what fate may betide him! Nor too long do they seek, Ere a horrible reek, Like the fumes from some villanous tavern, Set the dogs on the snuff, For they scent well enough The foul monster coil'd up in his cavern! Then alighting with speed From his terrified steed, Which he ties to a tree for the present, With his sword ready drawn, Strides the Ritter High-born, And along with him drags the scared peasant! “O Sir Knight, good Sir Knight! I am near enough quite— I have shown you the beast and his grotto:” But before he can reach Any farther in speech, He is stricken stone-dead by Sir Otto! Who withdrawing himself To a high rocky shelf, Sees the monster his tail disentangle From each tortuous coil, With a sudden turmoil, And rush forth the dead peasant to mangle. With his terrible claws, And his horrible jaws, He soon moulds the warm corse to a jelly; Which he quickly sucks in To his own wicked skin And then sinks at full stretch on his belly. Then the Knight softly goes On the tips of his toes To the greedy and slumbering savage, And with one hearty stroke Of his sword, and a poke, Kills the beast that had made such a ravage. So, extended at length, Without motion or strength, That gorged serpent they call the constrictor, After dinner, while deep In lethargical sleep, Falls a prey to his Hottentot victor. “'Twas too easy by half!” Said the Knight with a laugh; “But as nobody witness'd the slaughter, I will swear, knock and knock, By Saint Winifred's clock, We were at it three hours and a quarter!” Then he chopped off the head Of the monster so dread, Which he tied to his horse as a trophy; And, with hounds, by the same Ragged path that he came, Home he jogg'd proud as Sultan or Sophi! Blessed Saints! what a rout When the news flew about, And the carcase was fetch'd in a waggon; What an outcry rose wild From man, woman, and child— “Live Sir Otto, who vanquish'd the Dragon!” All that night the thick walls Of the Knight's feudal halls Rang with shouts for the wine-cup and flagon; Whilst the vassals stood by, And repeated the cry— “Live Sir Otto, who vanquish'd the Dragon!” The next night, and the next, Still the fight was the text, 'Twas a theme for the minstrels to brag on! And the vassals' hoarse throats Still re-echoed the notes— “Live Sir Otto, who vanquish'd the Dragon!” There was never such work Since the days of King Stork, When he lived with the Frogs at free quarters; Not to name the invites That were sent down of nights, To the villagers' wives and their daughters! It was feast upon feast, For good cheer never ceased, And a foray replenish'd the flagon; And the vassals stood by, But more weak was the cry— “Live Sir Otto, who vanquish'd the Dragon!” Down again sank the sun, Nor were revels yet done— But as if ev'ry mouth had a gag on, Though the vassals stood round, Deuce a word or a sound Of “Sir Otto, who vanquish'd the Dragon!” There was feasting aloft, But through pillage so oft Down below there was wailing and hunger; And affection ran cold, And the food of the old, It was wolfishly snatch'd by the younger! Mad with troubles so vast, Where's the wonder at last If the peasants quite alter'd their motto?— And with one loud accord Cried out “Would to the Lord, That the Dragon had vanquish'd Sir Otto!” OUR LADY'S CHAPEL. A LEGEND OF COBLENZ. Whoe'er has cross'd the Mósel Bridge, And mounted by the fort of Kaiser Franz, Has seen, perchance, Just on the summit of St. Peter's ridge, A little open chapel to the right, Wherein the tapers aye are burning bright; So popular, indeed, this holy shrine, At least among the female population, By night, or at high noon, you see it shine, A very Missal for illumination! Yet, when you please, at morn or eve, go by All other Chapels, standing in the fields, Whose mouldy, wifeless husbandry but yields Beans, peas, potatoes, mangel-wurzel, rye, And lo! the Virgin, lonely, dark, and hush, Without the glimmer of a farthing rush! But on Saint Peter's Hill The lights are burning, burning, burning still. In fact, it is a pretty retail trade To furnish forth the candles ready made; And close beside the chapel and the way, A chandler, at her stall, sits day by day, And sells, both long and short, the waxen tapers Smarten'd with tinsel-foil and tinted papers. To give of the mysterious truth an inkling, Those who in this bright chapel breathe a prayer To “Unser Frow,” and burn a taper there, Are said to get a husband “in a twinkling:” Just as she-glowworms, if it be not scandal, Catch partners with their matrimonial candle. How kind of blessed saints in heaven— Where none in marriage, we are told, are given— To interfere below in making matches, And help old maidens to connubial catches! The truth is, that instead of looking smugly (At least, so whisper wags satirical) The votaries are all so old and ugly, No man could fall in love but by a miracle. However, that such waxen gifts and vows Are sometimes for the purpose efficacious, In helping to a spouse, Is vouch'd for by a story most veracious. A certain Woman, though in name a wife, Yet doom'd to lonely life, Her truant husband having been away Nine years, two months, a week, and half a day,— Without remembrances by words or deeds,— Began to think she had sufficient handle To talk of widowhood and burn her weeds— Of course with a wax-candle. Sick, single-handed with the world to grapple, Weary of solitude, and spleen, and vapours, Away she hurried to Our Lady's Chapel, Full-handed with two tapers— And pray'd as she had never pray'd before, To be a bonâ fide wife once more. “Oh Holy Virgin! listen to my prayer! And for sweet mercy, and thy sex's sake, Accept the vows and offerings I make— Others set up one light, but here's a pair!” Her prayer, it seem'd, was heard; For in three little weeks, exactly reckon'd, As blithe as any bird, She stood before the Priest with Hans the Second;— A fact that made her gratitude so hearty, To “Unser Frow,” and her propitious shrine, She sent two waxen candles superfine, Long enough for a Lapland evening party! Rich was the Wedding Feast and rare— What sausages were there! Of sweets and sours there was a perfect glut: With plenteous liquors to wash down good cheer Brantwein, and Rhum, Kirsch-wasser, and Krug Bier, And wine so sharp that ev'ry one was cut. Rare was the feast—but rarer was the quality Of mirth, of smoky-joke, and song, and toast,— When just in all the middle of their jollity— With bumpers fill'd to hostess and to host, And all the unborn branches of their house, Unwelcome and unask'd, like Banquo's Ghost, In walk'd the long-lost Spouse! What pen could ever paint The hubbub when the Hubs were thus confronted! The bridesmaids fitfully began to faint; The bridesmen stared—some whistled and some grunted: Fierce Hans the First look'd like a boar that's hunted; Poor Hans the Second like a suckling calf: Meanwhile, confounded by the double miracle, The two-fold bride sobb'd out, with tears hysterical, “Oh Holy Virgin, you're too good—by half!” MORAL. Ye Cóblenz maids, take warning by the rhyme, And as our Christian laws forbid polygamy For fear of bigamy, Only light up one taper at a time. LOVE LANGUAGE OF A MERRY YOUNG SOLDIER. “Ach, Gretchen, mein Täubchen.” O Gretel, my Dove, my heart's Trumpet, My Cannon, my Big Drum, and also my Musket, O hear me, my mild little Dove, In your still little room. Your portrait, my Gretel, is always on guard, Is always attentive to Love's parole and watchword; Your picture is always going the rounds, My Gretel, I call at every hour! My heart's knapsack is always full of you; My looks, they are quartered with you; And when I bite off the top end of a cartridge, Then I think that I give you a kiss. You alone are my Word of Command and orders, Yea, my Right-face, Left-face, Brown Tommy, and wine, And at the word of command “Shoulder Arms!” Then I think you say “Take me in your arms.” Your eyes sparkle like a Battery, Yea, they wound like Bombs and Grenades; As black as gunpowder is your hair, Your hand as white as Parading breeches! Yes, you are the Match and I am the Cannon; Have pity, my love, and give quarter, And give the word of command, “Wheel round Into my heart's Barrack Yard.” AN OPEN QUESTION. “It is the king's highway that we are in, and in this way it is that thou hast placed the lions.” —Bunyan. What! shut the gardens! lock the latticed gate! Refuse the shilling and the fellow's ticket! And hang a wooden notice up to state, “On Sundays no admittance at this wicket!” The birds, the beasts, and all the reptile race Denied to friends and visitors till Monday! Now, really, this appears the common case Of putting too much Sabbath into Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? The Gardens,—so unlike the ones we dub Of Tea, wherein the artisan carouses,— Mere shrubberies without one drop of shrub,— Wherefore should they be closed like public-houses? No ale is vended at the wild Deer's Head,— Nor rum—nor gin—not even of a Monday— The Lion is not carved—or gilt—or red, And does not send out porter of a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? The bear denied! the leopard under locks! As if his spots would give contagious fevers; The beaver close as hat within its box; So different from other Sunday beavers! The birds invisible—the gnaw-way rats— The seal hermetically seal'd till Monday— The monkey tribe—the family of cats,— We visit other families on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? What is the brute profanity that shocks The super-sensitively serious feeling? The kangaroo—is he not orthodox To bend his legs, the way he does, in kneeling? Was strict Sir Andrew, in his sabbath coat, Struck all a heap to see a Coati Mundi? Or did the Kentish Plumtree faint to note The pelicans presenting bills on Sunday?— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? What feature has repulsed the serious set? What error in the bestial birth or breeding, To put their tender fancies on the fret? One thing is plain—it is not in the feeding! Some stiffish people think that smoking joints Are carnal sins 'twixt Saturday and Monday— But then the beasts are pious on these points, For they all eat cold dinners on a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? What change comes o'er the spirit of the place, As if transmuted by some spell organic? Turns fell hyæna of the ghoulish race? The snake, pro tempore, the true Satanic? Do Irish minds,—(whose theory allows That now and then Good Friday falls on Monday)— Do Irish minds suppose that Indian Cows Are wicked Bulls of Bashan on a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? There are some moody fellows, not a few, Who, turn'd by Nature with a gloomy bias, Renounce black devils to adopt the blue, And think when they are dismal they are pious: Is't possible that Pug's untimely fun Has sent the brutes to Coventry till Monday— Or p'rhaps some animal, no serious one, Was overheard in laughter on a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? What dire offence have serious fellows found To raise their spleen against the Regent's spinney? Were charitable boxes handed round, And would not guinea pigs subscribe their guinea? Perchance the Demoiselle refused to moult The feathers in her head—at least till Monday; Or did the elephant unseemly, bolt A tract presented to be read on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? At whom did Leo struggle to get loose? Who mourns through monkey tricks his damaged clothing? Who has been hiss'd by the Canadian goose? On whom did Llama spit in utter loathing? Some Smithfield saint did jealous feelings tell To keep the Puma out of sight till Monday, Because he prey'd extempore as well As certain wild Itinerants on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? To me it seems that in the oddest way (Begging the pardon of each rigid Socius) Our would-be keepers of the Sabbath-day Are like the keepers of the brutes ferocious— As soon the tiger might expect to stalk About the grounds from Saturday till Monday, As any harmless man to take a walk, If saints could clap him in a cage on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? In spite of all hypocrisy can spin, As surely as I am a Christian scion, I cannot think it is a mortal sin— (Unless he's loose) to look upon a lion. I really think that one may go, perchance, To see a bear, as guiltless as on Monday— (That is, provided that he did not dance) Bruin's no worse than baking on a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? In spite of all the fanatic compiles, I cannot think the day a bit diviner, Because no children, with forestalling smiles, Throng, happy, to the gates of Eden Minor— It is not plain, to my poor faith at least, That what we christen “Natural” on Monday, The wondrous History of bird and beast, Can be unnatural because it's Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? Whereon is sinful fantasy to work? The dove, the wing'd Columbus of man's haven? The tender love-bird—or the filial stork? The punctual crane—the providential raven? The pelican whose bosom feeds her young? Nay, must we cut from Saturday till Monday That feather'd marvel with a human tongue, Because she does not preach upon a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? The busy beaver—that sagacious beast! The sheep that own'd an Oriental Shepherd— That desert-ship the camel of the East, The horn'd rhinoceros—the spotted leopard— The creatures of the Great Creator's hand Are surely sights for better days than Monday— The elephant, although he wears no band, Has he no sermon in his trunk for Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? What harm if men who burn the midnight-oil, Weary of frame, and worn and wan in feature, Seek once a-week their spirits to assoil, And snatch a glimpse of “Animated Nature?” Better it were if, in his best of suits, The artisan, who goes to work on Monday, Should spend a leisure hour amongst the brutes, Than make a beast of his own self on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? Why, zounds! what raised to Protestant a fuss (Omit the zounds! for which I make apology) But that the Papists, like some fellows, thus Had somehow mixed up Dens with their theology? Is Brahma's bull—a Hindoo god at home— A papal bull to be tied up till Monday— Or Leo, like his namesake, Pope of Rome, That there is such a dread of them on Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? Spirit of Kant! have we not had enough To make religion sad, and sour, and snubbish, But saints zoological must cant their stuff, As vessels cant their ballast—rattling rubbish! Once let the sect, triumphant to their text, Shut Nero up from Saturday till Monday, And sure as fate they will deny us next To see the dandelions on a Sunday— But what is your opinion, Mrs. Grundy? A TALE OF A TRUMPET. “Old woman, old woman, will you go a-shearing? Speak a little louder, for I'm very hard of hearing.” Old Ballad. Of all old women hard of hearing, The deafest, sure, was Dame Eleanor Spearing! On her head, it is true, Two flaps there grew, That served for a pair of gold rings to go through, But for any purpose of ears in a parley, They heard no more than ears of barley. No hint was needed from D. E. F. You saw in her face that the woman was deaf: From her twisted mouth to her eyes so peery, Each queer feature asked a query; A look that said in a silent way, “Who? and What? and How? and Eh? I'd give my ears to know what you say!” And well she might! for each auricular Was deaf as a post—and that post in particular That stands at the corner of Dyott Street now, And never hears a word of a row! Ears that might serve her now and then As extempore racks for an idle pen; Or to hang with hoops from jewellers' shops With coral, ruby, or garnet drops; Or, provided the owner so inclined, Ears to stick a blister behind; But as for hearing wisdom, or wit, Falsehood, or folly, or tell-tale-tit, Or politics, whether of Fox or Pitt, Sermon, lecture, or musical bit, Harp, piano, fiddle, or kit, They might as well, for any such wish, Have been butter'd, done brown, and laid in a dish! She was deaf as a post,—as said before— And as deaf as twenty similes more, Including the adder, that deafest of snakes, Which never hears the coil it makes. She was deaf as a house—which modern tricks Of language would call as deaf as bricks— For her all human kind were dumb, Her drum, indeed, was so muffled a drum, That none could get a sound to come, Unless the Devil who had Two Sticks! She was deaf as a stone—say, one of the stones Demosthenes suck'd to improve his tones; And surely deafness no further could reach Than to be in his mouth without hearing his speech! She was deaf as a nut—for nuts, no doubt, Are deaf to the grub that's hollowing out— As deaf, alas! as the dead and forgotten— (Gray has noticed the waste of breath, In addressing the “dull, cold ear of death”), Or the Felon's ear that was stuff'd with Cotton— Or Charles the First in statue quo; Or the still-born figures of Madame Tussaud, With their eyes of glass, and their hair of flax, That only stare whatever you “ax,” For their ears, you know, are nothing but wax. She was deaf as the ducks that swam in the pond, And wouldn't listen to Mrs. Bond,— As deaf as any Frenchman appears, When he puts his shoulders into his ears: And—whatever the citizen tells his son— As deaf as Gog and Magog at one! Or, still to be a simile-seeker, As deaf as dogs'-ears to Enfield's Speaker! She was deaf as any tradesman's dummy, Or as Pharaoh's mother's mother's mummy; Whose organs, for fear of our modern sceptics, Were plugg'd with gums and antiseptics. She was deaf as a nail—that you cannot hammer A meaning into for all your clamour— There never was such a deaf old Gammer! So formed to worry Both Lindley and Murray, By having no ear for Music or Grammar! Deaf to sounds, as a ship out of soundings, Deaf to verbs, and all their compoundings, Adjective, noun, and adverb, and particle, Deaf to even the definite article— No verbal message was worth a pin, Though you hired an earwig to carry it in! In short, she was twice as deaf as Deaf Burke, Or all the Deafness in Yearsley's work, Who in spite of his skill in hardness of hearing, Boring, blasting, and pioneering, To give the dunny organ a clearing, Could never have cured Dame Eleanor Spearing. Of course the loss was a great privation, For one of her sex—whatever her station— And none the less that the Dame had a turn For making all families one concern, And learning whatever there was to learn In the prattling, tattling village of Tringham— As who wore silk? and who wore gingham? And what the Atkins's shop might bring 'em? How the Smiths contrived to live? and whether The fourteen Murphys all pigg'd together? The wages per week of the Weavers and Skinners, And what they boil'd for their Sunday dinners? What plates the Bugsbys had on the shelf, Crockery, china, wooden, or delf? And if the parlour of Mrs. O'Grady Had a wicked French print, or Death and the Lady? Did Snip and his wife continue to jangle? Had Mrs. Wilkinson sold her mangle? What liquor was drunk by Jones and Brown? And the weekly score they ran up at the Crown? If the Cobbler could read, and believed in the Pope? And how the Grubbs were off for soap? If the Snobbs had furnish'd their room up-stairs, And how they managed for tables and chairs, Beds, and other household affairs, Iron, wooden, and Staffordshire wares? And if they could muster a whole pair of bellows? In fact, she had much of the spirit that lies Perdu in a notable set of Paul Prys, By courtesy called Statistical Fellows— A prying, spying, inquisitive clan, Who have gone upon much of the self-same plan, Jotting the Labouring Class's riches; And after poking in pot and pan, And routing garments in want of stitches, Have ascertained that a working man Wears a pair and a quarter of average breeches! But this alas! from her loss of hearing, Was all a seal'd book to Dame Eleanor Spearing; And often her tears would rise to their founts— Supposing a little scandal at play 'Twixt Mrs. O'Fie and Mrs. Au Fait— That she couldn't audit the Gossips' accounts. 'Tis true, to her cottage still they came, And ate her muffins just the same, And drank the tea of the widow'd Dame, And never swallow'd a thimble the less Of something the Reader is left to guess, For all the deafness of Mrs. S., Who saw them talk, and chuckle, and cough, But to see and not share in the social flow, She might as well have lived, you know, In one of the houses in Owen's Row, Near the New River Head, with its water cut off! And yet the almond-oil she had tried, And fifty infallible things beside, Hot, and cold, and thick, and thin, Dabb'd, and dribbled, and squirted in: But all remedies fail'd; and though some it was cloar Like the brandy and salt (We now exalt) Had made a noise in the public ear, She was just as deaf as ever, poor dear! At last—one very fine day in June— Suppose her sitting, Busily knitting, And humming she didn't quite know what tune; For nothing she heard but a sort of a whizz, Which, unless the sound of the circulation, Or of Thoughts in the process of fabrication, By a Spinning-Jennyish operation, It's hard to say what buzzing it is. However, except that ghost of a sound, She sat in a silence most profound— The cat was purring about the mat, But her Mistress heard no more of that Than if it had been a boatswain's cat; And as for the clock the moments nicking, The Dame only gave it credit for ticking. The bark of her dog she did not catch; Nor yet the click of the lifted latch; Nor yet the creak of the opening door; Nor yet the fall of a foot on the floor— But she saw the shadow that crept on her gown And turn'd its skirt of a darker brown. And lo! a man! a Pedlar! ay, marry, With the little back-shop that such tradesmen carry, Stock'd with brooches, ribbons, and rings, Spectacles, razors, and other odd things, For lad and lass, as Autolycus sings; A chapman for goodness and cheapness of ware, Held a fair dealer enough at a fair, But deem'd a piratical sort of invader By him we dub the “regular trader,” Who—luring the passengers in as they pass By lamps gay panels, and mouldings of brass, And windows with only one huge pane of glass, And his name in gilt characters, German or Roman,— If he isn't a Pedlar, at least he's a Showman! However, in the stranger came, And, the moment he met the eyes of the Dame, Threw her as knowing a nod as though He had known her fifty long years ago; And presto! before she could utter “Jack”— Much less “Robinson”—open'd his pack— And then from amongst his portable gear, With even more than a Pedlar's tact,— (Slick himself might have envied the act)— Before she had time to be deaf, in fact— Popp'd a Trumpet into her ear. “There, Ma'am! try it! You needn't buy it— The last New Patent—and nothing comes nigh it For affording the Deaf, at a little expense, The sense of hearing, and hearing of sense! A Real Blessing—and no mistake, Invented for poor Humanity's sake; For what can be a greater privation Than playing Dumby to all creation, And only looking at conversation— Great Philosophers talking like Platos, And Members of Parliament moral as Catos, And your ears as dull as waxy potatoes! Not to name the mischievous quizzers, Sharp as knives, but double as scissors, Who get you to answer quite by guess Yes for No, and No for Yes.” (“That's very true,” says Dame Eleanor S.) “Try it again! No harm in trying— I'm sure you'll find it worth your buying, A little practice—that is all— And you'll hear a whisper, however small, Through an Act of Parliament party-wall,— Every syllable clear as day, And even what people are going to say— I wouldn't tell a lie, I wouldn't, But my Trumpets have heard what Solomon's couldn't; And as for Scott he promises fine, But can he warrant his horns like mine Never to hear what a Lady shouldn't— Only a guinea—and can't take less.” (“That's very dear,” says Dame Eleanor S.) “Dear!—Oh dear, to call it dear! Why it isn't a horn you buy, but an ear; Only think, and you'll find on reflection You're bargaining, Ma'am, for the Voice of Affection; For the language of Wisdom, and Virtue, and Truth, And the sweet little innocent prattle of youth: Not to mention the striking of clocks— Cackle of hens—crowing of cocks— Lowing of cow, and bull, and ox— Bleating of pretty pastoral flocks— Murmur of waterfall over the rocks— Every sound that Echo mocks— Vocals, fiddles, and musical-box— And zounds! to call such a concert dear! But I mustn't “swear with my horn in your ear.” Why in buying that Trumpet you buy all those That Harper, or any trumpeter, blows At the Queen's Levees or the Lord Mayor's Shows, At least as far as the music goes, Including the wonderful lively sound, Of the Guards' key-bugles all the year round: Come—suppose we call it a pound! “Come,” said the talkative Man of the Pack, “Before I put my box on my back, For this elegant, useful Conductor of Sound, Come—suppose we call it a pound! “Only a pound! it's only the price Of hearing a Concert once or twice, It's only the fee You might give Mr. C. And after all not hear his advice, But common prudence would bid you stump it; For, not to enlarge, It's the regular charge At a Fancy Fair for a penny trumpet. Lord! what's a pound to the blessing of hearing!” (“A pound's a pound,” said Dame Eleanor Spearing.) “Try it again! no harm in trying! A pound's a pound there's no denying; But think what thousands and thousands of pounds We pay for nothing but hearing sounds: Sounds of Equity, Justice, and Law, Parliamentary jabber and jaw, Pious cant and moral saw, Hocus-pocus, and Nong-tong-paw, And empty sounds not worth a straw; Why it costs a guinea, as I'm a sinner, To hear the sounds at a Public Dinner! One pound one thrown into the puddle, To listen to Fiddle, Faddle, and Fuddle! Not to forget the sounds we buy From those who sell their sounds so high, That, unless the Managers pitch it strong, To get a Signora to warble a song, You must fork out the blunt with a haymaker's prong! “It's not the thing for me—I know it, To crack my own Trumpet up and blow it; But it is the best, and time will show it. There was Mrs. F. So very deaf, That she might have worn a percussion-cap, And been knock'd on the head without hearing it snap, Well, I sold her a horn, and the very next day She heard from her husband at Botany Bay! Come—eighteen shillings—that's very low, You'll save the money as shillings go, And I never knew so bad a lot, By hearing whether they ring or not! “Eighteen shillings! it's worth the price, Supposing you're delicate-minded and nice, To have the medical man of your choice, Instead of the one with the strongest voice— Who comes and asks you, how's your liver, And where you ache, and whether you shiver, And as to your nerves, so apt to quiver, As if he was hailing a boat on the river! And then, with a shout, like Pat in a riot, Tells you to keep yourself perfectly quiet! “Or a tradesman comes—as tradesmen will— Short and crusty about his bill, Of patience, indeed, a perfect scorner, And because you're deaf and unable to pay, Shouts whatever he has to say, In a vulgar voice, that goes over the way, Down the street and round the corner! Come—speak your mind—it's ‘No or Yes’” (“I've half a mind,” said Dame Eleanor S.) “Try it again—no harm in trying, Of course you hear me, as easy as lying; No pain at all, like a surgical trick, To make you squall, and struggle, and kick, Like Juno, or Rose, Whose ear undergoes Such horrid tugs at membrane and gristle, For being as deaf as yourself to a whistle! “You may go to surgical chaps if you choose, Who will blow up your tubes like copper flues, Or cut your tonsils right away, As you'd shell out your almonds for Christmas-day; And after all a matter of doubt, Whether you ever would hear the shout Of the little blackguards that bawl about, ‘There you go with your tonsils out!’ Why I knew a deaf Welshman, who came from Glamorgan On purpose to try a surgical spell, And paid a guinea, and might as well Have call'd a monkey into his organ! For the Aurist only took a mug, And pour'd in his ear some acoustical drug, That, instead of curing, deafen'd him rather, As Hamlet's uncle served Hamlet's father! That's the way with your surgical gentry! And happy your luck If you don't get stuck Through your liver and lights at a royal entry, Because you never answer'd the sentry! “Try it again, dear Madam, try it! Many would sell their beds to buy it. I warrant you often wake up in the night, Ready to shake to a jelly with fright, And up you must get to strike a light, And down you go, in you know what, Whether the weather is chilly or hot,— That's the way a cold is got,— To see if you heard a noise or not! “Why, bless you, a woman with organs like yours Is hardly safe to step out of doors! Just fancy a horse that comes full pelt, But as quiet as if he was ‘shod with felt,’ Till he rushes against you with all his force, And then I needn't describe the course, While he kicks you about without remorse, How awkward it is to be groom'd by a horse! Or a bullock comes, as mad as King Lear, And you never dream that the brute is near, Till he pokes his horn right into your ear, Whether you like the thing or lump it,— And all for want of buying a trumpet! “I'm not a female to fret and vex, But if I belonged to the sensitive sex, Exposed to all sorts of indelicate sounds, I wouldn't be deaf for a thousand pounds. Lord! only think of chucking a copper To Jack or Bob with a timber limb, Who looks as if he was singing a hymn, Instead of a song that's very improper! Or just suppose in a public place You see a great fellow a-pulling a face, With his staring eyes and his mouth like an O,— And how is a poor deaf lady to know,— The lower orders are up to such games— If he's calling ‘Green Peas,’ or calling her names?” (“They're tenpence a peck!” said the deafest of Dames.) “'Tis strange what very strong advising, By word of mouth, or advertising, By chalking on walls, or placarding on vans, With fifty other different plans, The very high pressure, in fact, of pressing, It needs to persuade one to purchase a blessing! Whether the Soothing American Syrup, A Safety Hat, or a Safety Stirrup,— Infallible Pills for the human frame, Or Rowland's O-don't-o (an ominous name)! A Doudney's suit which the shape so hits That it beats all others into fits; A Mechi's razor for beards unshorn, Or a Ghost-of-a-Whisper-Catching Horn! “Try it again, Ma'am, only try!” Was still the voluble Pedlar's cry; “It's a great privation, there's no dispute, To live like the dumb unsociable brute, And to hear no more of the pro and con, And how Society's going on, Than Mumbo Jumbo or Prester John, And all for want of this sine quâ non; Whereas, with a horn that never offends, You may join the genteelest party that is, And enjoy all the scandal, and gossip, and quiz, And be certain to hear of your absent friends;— Not that elegant ladies, in fact, In genteel society ever detract, Or lend a brush when a friend is black'd,— At least as a mere malicious act,— But only talk scandal for fear some fool Should think they were bred at charity school. Or, maybe, you like a little flirtation, Which even the most Don Juanish rake Would surely object to undertake At the same high pitch as an altercation. It's not for me, of course, to judge How much a Deaf Lady ought to begrudge; But half-a-guinea seems no great matter— Letting alone more rational patter— Only to hear a parrot chatter: Not to mention that feather'd wit, The Starling, who speaks when his tongue is slit; The Pies and Jays that utter words, And other Dicky Gossips of birds, That talk with as much good sense and decorum, As many Beaks who belong to the quorum. “Try it—buy it—say ten and six, The lowest price a miser could fix: I don't pretend with horns of mine, Like some in the advertising line, To ‘magnify sounds’ on such marvellous scales, That the sounds of a cod seem as big as a whale's; But popular rumours, right or wrong,— Charity sermons, short or long,— Lecture, speech, concerto, or song, All noises and voices, feeble or strong, From the hum of a gnat to the clash of a gong, This tube will deliver distinct and clear; Or, supposing by chance You wish to dance, Why, it's putting a Horn-pipe into your ear! Try it—buy it! Buy it—try it! The last New Patent, and nothing comes nigh it, For guiding sounds to their proper tunnel: Only try till the end of June, And if you and the Trumpet are out of tune I'll turn it gratis into a funnel!” In short, the pedlar so beset her,— Lord Bacon couldn't have gammon'd her better,— With flatteries plump and indirect, And plied his tongue with such effect,— A tongue that could almost have butter'd a crumpet,— The deaf old woman bought the Trumpet. The pedlar was gone. With the horn's assistance, She heard his steps die away in the distance; And then she heard the tick of the clock, The purring of puss, and the snoring of Shock; And she purposely dropp'd a pin that was little, And heard it fall as plain as a skittle! 'Twas a wonderful horn, to be but just! Nor meant to gather dust, must and rust; So in half a jiffy, or less than that, In her scarlet cloak and her steeple-hat, Like old Dame Trot, but without her cat, The gossip was hunting all Tringham thorough, As if she meant to canvass the borough, Trumpet in hand, or up to the cavity;— And, sure, had the horn been one of those The wild Rhinoceros wears on his nose, It couldn't have ripped up more depravity! Depravity! mercy shield her ears! 'Twas plain enough that her village peers In the ways of vice were no raw beginners; For whenever she raised the tube to her drum Such sounds were transmitted as only come From the very Brass Band of human sinners! Ribald jest and blasphemous curse (Bunyan never vented worse), With all those weeds, not flowers, of speech Which the Seven Dialecticians teach; Filthy Conjunctions, and Dissolute Nouns, And Particles pick'd from the kennels of towns, With Irregular Verbs for irregular jobs, Chiefly active in rows and mobs, Picking Possessive Pronouns' fobs, And Interjections as bad as a blight, Or an Eastern blast, to the blood and the sight; Fanciful phrases for crime and sin, And smacking of vulgar lips where Gin, Garlic, Tobacco, and offals go in— A jargon so truly adapted, in fact, To each thievish, obscene, and ferocious act, So fit for the brute with the human shape, Savage Baboon, or libidinous Ape, From their ugly mouths it will certainly come Should they ever get weary of shamming dumb! Alas! for the Voice of Virtue and Truth, And the sweet little innocent prattle of Youth! The smallest urchin whose tongue could tang, Shock'd the Dame with a volley of slang, Fit for Fagin's juvenile gang; While the charity chap, With his muffin cap, His crimson coat, and his badge so garish, Playing at dumps, or pitch in the hole, Cursed his eyes, limbs, body and soul, As if they didn't belong to the Parish! 'Twas awful to hear, as she went along, The wicked words of the popular song; Or supposing she listen'd—as gossips will— At a door ajar, or a window agape, To catch the sounds they allow'd to escape, Those sounds belonged to Depravity still! The dark allusion, or bolder brag Of the dexterous “dodge,” and the lots of “swag,” The plunder'd house—or the stolen nag— The blazing rick, or the darker crime, That quench'd the spark before its time— The wanton speech of the wife immoral— The noise of drunken or deadly quarrel, With savage menace, which threaten'd the life, Till the heart seem'd merely a strop “for the knife;” The human liver, no better than that, Which is sliced and thrown to an old woman's cat; And the head, so useful for shaking and nodding, To be punch'd into holes, like “a shocking bad hat,” That is only fit to be punch'd into wadding! In short, wherever she turn'd the horn, To the highly bred, or the lowly born, The working man, who look'd over the hedge, Or the mother nursing her infant pledge, The sober Quaker, averse to quarrels, Or the Governess pacing the village through, With her twelve Young Ladies, two and two, Looking, as such young ladies do, Truss'd by Decorum and stuff'd with morals— Whether she listen'd to Hob or Bob, Nob or Snob, The Squire on his cob, Or Trudge and his ass at a tinkering job, To the “Saint” who expounded at “Little Zion”— Or the “Sinner” who kept “the Golden Lion”— The man teetotally wean'd from liquor— The Beadle, the Clerk, or the Reverend Vicar— Nay, the very Pie in its cage of wicker— She gather'd such meanings, double or single, That like the bell With muffins to sell, Her ear was kept in a constant tingle! But this was nought to the tales of shame, The constant runnings of evil fame, Foul, and dirty, and black as ink, That her ancient cronies, with nod and wink, Pour'd in her horn like slops in a sink: While sitting in conclave, as gossips do, With their Hyson or Howqua, black or green, And not a little of feline spleen Lapp'd up in “Catty packages,” too, To give a zest to the sipping and supping; For still by some invisible tether, Scandal and Tea are link'd together, As surely as Scarification and Cupping; Yet never since Scandal drank Bohea— Or sloe, or whatever it happen'd to be, For some grocerly thieves Turn over new leaves, Without much amending their lives or their tea— No, never since cup was fill'd or stirr'd Were such wild and horrible anecdotes heard, As blacken'd their neighbours of either gender, Especially that, which is call'd the Tender, But, instead of the softness we fancy therewith, Was harden'd in vice as the vice of a smith. Women! the wretches! had soil'd and marr'd Whatever to womanly nature belongs; For the marriage tie they had no regard, Nay, sped their mates to the sexton's yard, (Like Madam Laffarge, who with poisonous pinches Kept cutting off her L by inches)— And as for drinking, they drank so hard That they drank their flat-irons, pokers, and tongs! The men—they fought and gambled at fairs; And poach'd—and didn't respect grey hairs— Stole linen, money, plate, poultry, and corses; And broke in houses as well as horses; Unfolded folds to kill their own mutton,— And would their own mothers and wives for a button: But not to repeat the deeds they did, Backsliding in spite of all moral skid, If all were true that fell from the tongue, There was not a villager, old or young, But deserved to be whipp'd, imprison'd, or hung, Or sent on those travels which nobody hurries, To publish at Colburn's, or Longman's, or Murray's. Meanwhile the Trumpet, con amore, Transmitted each vile diabolical story; And gave the least whisper of slips and falls, As that Gallery does in the Dome of St. Paul's, Which, as all the world knows, by practice or print, Is famous for making the most of a hint. Not a murmur of shame, Or buzz of blame, Not a flying report that flew at a name, Not a plausible gloss, or significant note, Not a word in the scandalous circles afloat, Of a beam in the eye, or diminutive mote, But vortex-like that tube of tin Suck'd the censorious particle in; And, truth to tell, for as willing an organ As ever listen'd to serpent's hiss, Nor took the viperous sound amiss, On the snaky head of an ancient Gorgon! The Dame, it is true, would mutter “shocking!” And give her head a sorrowful rocking, And make a clucking with palate and tongue, Like the call of Partlet to gather her young, A sound, when human, that always proclaims At least a thousand pities and shames; But still the darker the tale of sin, Like certain folks, when calamities burst, Who find a comfort in “hearing the worst,” The farther she poked the Trumpet in. Nay, worse, whatever she heard, she spread East and West, and North and South, Like the ball which, according to Captain Z, Went in at his ear, and came out at his mouth. What wonder between the Horn and the Dame, Such mischief was made wherever they came, That the parish of Tringham was all in a flame! For although it required such loud discharges, Such peals of thunder as rumbled at Lear, To turn the smallest of table-beer, A little whisper breathed into the ear Will sour a temper “as sour as varges.” In fact such very ill blood there grew, From this private circulation of stories, That the nearest neighbours the village through, Look'd at each other as yellow and blue, As any electioneering crew Wearing the colours of Whigs and Tories. Ah! well the Poet said, in sooth, That “whispering tongues can poison Truth,”— Yea, like a dose of oxalic acid, Wrench and convulse poor Peace, the placid, And rack dear Love with internal fuel, Like arsenic pastry, or what is as cruel, Sugar of lead, that sweetens gruel,— At least such torments began to wring 'em From the very morn When that mischievous Horn Caught the whisper of tongues in Tringham. The Social Clubs dissolved in huffs. And the Sons of Harmony came to cuffs, While feuds arose and family quarrels, That discomposed the mechanics of morals, For screws were loose between brother and brother, While sisters fasten'd their nails on each other; Such wrangles, and jangles, and miff, and tiff, And spar, and jar—and breezes as stiff As ever upset a friendship—or skiff! The plighted lovers, who used to walk, Refused to meet, and declined to talk; And wish'd for two moons to reflect the sun, That they mightn't look together on one; While wedded affection ran so low, That the oldest John Anderson snubbed his Jo— And instead of the toddle adown the hill, Hand in hand, As the song has planned, Scratch'd her, penniless, out of his will! In short, to describe what came to pass In a true, though somewhat theatrical way, Instead of “Love in a Village”—alas! The piece they perform'd was “The Devil to Pay!” However, as secrets are brought to light, And mischief comes home like chickens at night; And rivers are track'd throughout their course. And forgeries traced to their proper source;— And the sow that ought By the ear is caught,— And the sin to the sinful door is brought; And the cat at last escapes from the bag— And the saddle is placed on the proper nag And the fog blows off, and the key is found— And the faulty scent is pick'd out by the hound— And the fact turns up like a worm from the ground— And the matter gets wind to waft it about; And a hint goes abroad, and the murder is out— And the riddle is guess'd—and the puzzle is known— So the truth was sniff'd, and the Trumpet was blown! 'Tis a day in November—a day of fog— But the Tringham people are all agog; Fathers, Mothers, and Mothers' Sons,— With sticks, and staves, and swords, and guns,— As if in pursuit of a rabid dog; But their voices—raised to the highest pitch— Declare that the game is “a Witch!—a Witch!” Over the Green, and along by The George— Past the Stocks, and the Church, and the Forge, And round the Pound, and skirting the Pond, Till they come to the whitewash'd cottage beyond, And there at the door they muster and cluster, And thump, and kick, and bellow, and bluster— Enough to put Old Nick in a fluster! A noise, indeed, so loud and long, And mix'd with expressions so very strong, That supposing, according to popular fame, “Wise Woman” and Witch to be the same, No hag with a broom would unwisely stop, But up and away through the chimney-top; Whereas, the moment they burst the door, Planted fast on her sanded floor, With her Trumpet up to her organ of hearing, Lo and behold!—Dame Eleanor Spearing! Oh! then arises the fearful shout— Bawl'd and scream'd, and bandied about— “Seize her!—Drag the old Jezebel out!” While the Beadle—the foremost of all the band, Snatches the Horn from her trembling hand— And after a pause of doubt and fear, Puts it up to his sharpest ear. “Now silence—silence—one and all!” For the Clerk is quoting from Holy Paul! But before he rehearses A couple of verses, The Beadle lets the Trumpet fall: For instead of the words so pious and humble, He hears a supernatural grumble. Enough, enough! and more than enough;— Twenty impatient hands and rough, By arm, and leg, and neck, and scruff, Apron, 'kerchief, gown of stuff— Cap, and pinner, sleeve, and cuff— Are clutching the Witch wherever they can, With the spite of Woman and fury of Man; And then—but first they kill her cat, And murder her dog on the very mat— And crush the infernal Trumpet flat;— And then they hurry her through the door She never, never will enter more! Away! away! down the dusty lane They pull her, and haul her, with might and main; And happy the hawbuck, Tom or Harry, Dandy, or Sandy, Jerry, or Larry, Who happens to get “a leg to carry!” And happy the foot that can give her a kick, And happy the hand that can find a brick— And happy the fingers that hold a stick— Knife to cut, or pin to prick— And happy the Boy who can lend her a lick;— Nay, happy the urchin—Charity-bred,— Who can shy very nigh to her wicked old head! Alas! to think how people's creeds Are contradicted by people's deeds! But though the wishes that Witches utter Can play the most diabolical rigs— Send styes in the eye—and measle the pigs— Grease horses' heels—and spoil the butter; Smut and mildew the corn on the stalk— And turn new milk to water and chalk,— Blight apples—and give the chickens the pip— And cramp the stomach—and cripple the hip— And waste the body—and addle the eggs— And give a baby bandy legs; Though in common belief a Witch's curse Involves all these horrible things, and worse— As ignorant bumpkins all profess, No bumpkin makes a poke the less At the back or ribs of old Eleanor S.! As if she were only a sack of barley! Or gives her credit for greater might Than the Powers of Darkness confer at night On that other old woman, the parish Charley! Ay, now's the time for a Witch to call On her Imps and Sucklings one and all— Newes, Pyewacket, or Peck in the Crown, (As Matthew Hopkins has handed them down) Dick, and Willet, and Sugar-and-Sack, Greedy Grizel, Jarmara the Black, Vinegar Tom and the rest of the pack— Ay, now's the nick for her friend Old Harry To come “with his tail” like the bold Glengarry, And drive her foes from their savage job As a mad Black Bullock would scatter a mob:— But no such matter is down in the bond; And spite of her cries that never cease, But scare the ducks and astonish the geese, The dame is dragg'd to the fatal pond! And now they come to the water's brim— And in they bundle her—sink or swim; Though it's twenty to one that the wretch must drown, With twenty sticks to hold her down; Including the help to the self-same end, Which a travelling Pedlar stops to lend. A Pedlar!—Yes!—The same!—the same! Who sold the Horn to the drowning Dame! And now is foremost amid the stir, With a token only reveal'd to her; A token that makes her shudder and shriek, And point with her finger, and strive to speak— But before she can utter the name of the Devil, Her head is under the water level! MORAL. There are folks about town—to name no names— Who much resemble that deafest of Dames! And over their tea, and muffins, and crumpets, Circulate many a scandalous word, And whisper tales they could only have heard Through some such Diabolical Trumpets! MISS KILMANSEGG AND HER PRECIOUS LEG. A GOLDEN LEGEND. “What is here? Gold! yellow, glittering, precious gold?” Timon of Athens. HER PEDIGREE. To trace the Kilmansegg pedigree To the very root of the family tree Were a task as rash as ridiculous: Through antediluvian mists as thick As London fog such a line to pick Were enough, in truth, to puzzle old Nick,— Not to name Sir Harris Nicolas. It wouldn't require much verbal strain To trace the Kill-man, perchance, to Cain; But, waiving all such digressions, Suffice it, according to family lore, A Patriarch Kilmansegg lived of yore, Who was famed for his great possessions. Tradition said he feather'd his nest Through an Agricultural Interest In the Golden Age of Farming; When golden eggs were laid by the geese, And Colchian sheep wore a golden fleece, And golden pippins—the sterling kind Of Hesperus—now so hard to find— Made Horticulture quite charming! A Lord of Land, on his own estate, He lived at a very lively rate, But his income would bear carousing; Such acres he had of pasture and heath, With herbage so rich from the ore beneath, The very ewe's and lambkin's teeth Were turn'd into gold by browsing. He gave, without any extra thrift, A flock of sheep for a birthday gift To each son of his loins, or daughter: And his debts—if debts he had—at will He liquidated by giving each bill A dip in Pactolian water. 'Twas said that even his pigs of lead, By crossing with some by Midas bred, Made a perfect mine of his piggery. And as for cattle, one yearling bull Was worth all Smithfield-market full Of the Golden Bulls of Pope Gregory. The high-bred horses within his stud, Like human creatures of birth and blood, Had their Golden Cups and flagons: And as for the common husbandry nags, Their noses were tied in money-bags, When they stopp'd with the carts and waggons. Moreover, he had a Golden Ass, Sometimes at stall, and sometimes at grass, That was worth his own weight in money— And a golden hive, on a Golden Bank, Where golden bees, by alchemical prank, Gather'd gold instead of honey. Gold! and gold! and gold without end! He had gold to lay by, and gold to spend, Gold to give, and gold to lend, And reversions of gold in futuro. In wealth the family revell'd and roll'd, Himself and wife and sons so bold;— And his daughters sang to their harps of gold “O bella eta del' oro!” Such was the tale of the Kilmansegg Kin, In golden text on a vellum skin, Though certain people would wink and grin, And declare the whole story a parable— That the Ancestor rich was one Jacob Ghrimes, Who held a long lease, in prosperous times, Of acres, pasture and arable. That as money makes money, his golden bees Were the Five per Cents., or which you please When his cash was more than plenty— That the golden cups were racing affairs; And his daughters, who sang Italian airs, Had their golden harps of Clementi. That the Golden Ass, or Golden Bull, Was English John, with his pockets full, Then at war by land and water: While beef, and mutton, and other meat, Were almost as dear as money to eat, And Farmers reaped Golden Harvests of wheat At the Lord knows what per quarter! HER BIRTH. What different dooms our birthdays bring! For instance, one little manikin thing Survives to wear many a wrinkle; While Death forbids another to wake, And a son that it took nine moons to make Expires without even a twinkle! Into this world we come like ships, Launch'd from the docks, and stocks, and slips, For fortune fair or fatal; And one little craft is cast away In its very first trip in Babbicome Bay, While another rides safe at Port Natal. What different lots our stars accord! This babe to be hail'd and woo'd as a Lord! And that to be shunn'd like a leper! One, to the world's wine, honey, and corn, Another, like Colchester native, born To its vinegar, only, and pepper. One is litter'd under a roof Neither wind nor water proof— That's the prose of Love in a Cottage— A puny, naked, shivering wretch, The whole of whose birthright would not fetch, Though Robins himself drew up the sketch The bid of “a mess of pottage.” Born of Fortunatus's kin, Another comes tenderly ushered in To a prospect all bright and burnish'd: No tenant he for life's back slums— He comes to the world, as a gentleman comes To a lodging ready furnish'd. And the other sex—the tender—the fair— What wide reverses of fate are there! Whilst Margaret, charm'd by the Bulbul rare, In a garden of Gul reposes— Poor Peggy hawks nosegays from street to street Till—think of that, who find life so sweet!— She hates the smell of roses! Not so with the infant Kilmansegg! She was not born to steal or beg, Or gather cresses in ditches; To plait the straw, or bind the shoe, Or sit all day to hem and sew, As females must—and not a few— To fill their insides with stitches! She was not doom'd, for bread to eat, To be put to her hands as well as her feet— To carry home linen from mangles— Or heavy-hearted, and weary-limb'd, To dance on a rope in a jacket trimm'd With as many blows as spangles. She was one of those who by Fortune's boon Are born, as they say, with a silver spoon In her mouth, not a wooden ladle: To speak according to poet's wont, Plutus as sponsor stood at her font, And Midas rock'd the cradle. At her first debut she found her head On a pillar of down, in a downy bed, With a damask canopy over. For although, by the vulgar popular saw, All mothers are said to be “in the straw,” Some children are born in clover. Her very first draught of vital air, It was not the common chameleon fare Of plebeian lungs and noses,— No—her earliest sniff Of this world was a whiff Of the genuine Otto of Roses! When she saw the light, it was no mere ray Of that light so common—so everyday— That the sun each morning launches— But six wax tapers dazzled her eyes, From a thing—a gooseberry bush for size— With a golden stem and branches. She was born exactly at half-past two, As witness'd a time-piece in or-molu That stood on a marble table— Showing at once the time of day, And a team of Gildings running away As fast as they were able, With a golden God, with a golden Star, And a golden Spear, in a golden Car, According to Grecian fable. Like other babes, at her birth she cried; Which made a sensation far and wide— Ay, for twenty miles around her: For though to the ear 'twas nothing more Than an infant's squall, it was really the roar Of a Fifty-thousand Pounder! It shook the next heir In his library chair, And made him cry, “Confound her!” Of signs and omens there was no dearth, Any more than at Owen Glendower's birth, Or the advent of other great people: Two bullocks dropp'd dead, As if knock'd on the head, And barrels of stout And ale ran about, And the village-bells such a peal rang out, That they crack'd the village-steeple. In no time at all, like mushroom spawn, Tables sprang up all over the lawn; Not furnish'd scantly or shabbily, But on scale as vast As that huge repast, With its loads and cargoes Of drink and botargoes, At the Birth of the Babe in Rabelais. Hundreds of men were turn'd into beasts, Like the guests at Circe's horrible feasts, By the magic of ale and cider: And each country lass, and each country lad, Began to caper and dance like mad, And ev'n some old ones appear'd to have had A bite from the Naples Spider. Then as night came on, It had scared King John Who considered such signs not risible, To have seen the maroons, And the whirling moons, And the serpents of flame, And wheels of the same, That according to some were “whizzable.” Oh, happy Hope of the Kilmanseggs! Thrice happy in head, and body, and legs, That her parents had such full pockets! For had she been born of Want and Thrift, For care and nursing all adrift, It's ten to one she had had to make shift With rickets instead of rockets! And how was the precious baby drest? In a robe of the East, with lace of the West, Like one of Crœsus's issue— Her best bibs were made Of rich gold brocade, And the others of silver tissue. And when the Baby inclined to nap She was lull'd on a Gros de Naples lap, By a nurse in a modish Paris cap, Of notions so exalted, She drank nothing lower than Curacoa, Maraschino, or pink Noyau, And on principle never malted. From a golden boat, with a golden spoon, The babe was fed night, morning, and noon; And altho' the tale seems fabulous, 'Tis said her tops and bottoms were gilt, Like the oats in that Stable-yard Palace built For the horse of Heliogabalus. And when she took to squall and kick— For pain will wring, and pins will prick, E'en the wealthiest nabob's daughter— They gave her no vulgar Dalby or gin, But a liquor with leaf of gold therein, Videlicet,—Dantzic Water. In short, she was born, and bred, and nurst, And drest in the best from the very first, To please the genteelest censor— And then, as soon as strength would allow, Was vaccinated, as babes are now, With virus ta'en from the best-bred cow Of Lord Althorpe's—now Earl Spencer. HER CHRISTENING. Though Shakspeare asks us, “What's in a name?” (As if cognomens were much the same), There's really a very great scope in it. A name?—why, wasn't there Doctor Dodd, That servant at once of Mammon and God, Who found four thousand pounds and odd, A prison—a cart—and a rope in it? A name?—if the party had a voice, What mortal would be a Bugg by choice? As a Hogg, a Grubb, or a Chubb rejoice? Or any such nauseous blazon? Not to mention many a vulgar name, That would make a door-plate blush for shame, If door-plates were not so brazen! A name?—it has more than nominal worth, And belongs to good or bad luck at birth— As dames of a certain degree know. In spite of his Page's hat and hose, His Page's jacket, and buttons in rows, Bob only sounds like a page in prose Till turn'd into Rupertino. Now to christen the infant Kilmansegg, For days and days it was quite a plague, To hunt the list in the Lexicon: And scores were tried, like coin, by the ring, Ere names were found just the proper thing For a minor rich as a Mexican. Then cards were sent the presence to beg Of all the kin of Kilmansegg, White, yellow, and brown relations: Brothers, Wardens of City Halls, And Uncles—rich as three Golden Balls From taking pledges of nations. Nephews, whom Fortune seem'd to bewitch, Rising in life like rockets— Nieces, whose doweries knew no hitch— Aunts, as certain of dying rich As candles in golden sockets— Cousins German and Cousin's sons, All thriving and opulent—some had tons Of Kentish hops in their pockets! For money had stuck to the race through life (As it did to the bushel when cash so rife Posed Ali Baba's brother's wife)— And down to the Cousins and Coz-lings, The fortunate brood of the Kilmanseggs, As if they had come out of golden eggs, Were all as wealthy as “Goslings.” It would fill a Court Gazette to name What East and West End people came To the rite of Christianity: The lofty Lord, and the titled Dame, All di'monds, plumes, and urbanity: His Lordship the May'r with his golden chain, And two Gold Sticks, and the Sheriffs twain, Nine foreign Counts, and other great men With their orders and stars, to help “M. or N.” To renounce all pomp and vanity. To paint the maternal Kilmansegg The pen of an Eastern Poet would beg, And need an elaborate sonnet; How she sparkled with gems whenever she stirr'd, And her head niddle-noddled at every word, And seem'd so happy, a Paradise Bird Had nidificated upon it. And Sir Jacob the Father strutted and bow'd, And smiled to himself, and laugh'd aloud, To think of his heiress and daughter— And then in his pockets he made a grope, And then, in the fulness of joy and hope, Seem'd washing his hands with invisible soap In imperceptible water. He had roll'd in money like pigs in mud, Till it seem'd to have enter'd into his blood By some occult projection: And his cheeks instead of a healthy hue, As yellow as any guinea grew, Making the common phrase seem true, About a rich complexion. And now came the nurse, and during a pause, Her dead-leaf satin would fitly cause A very autumnal rustle— So full of figure, so full of fuss, As she carried about the babe to buss, She seem'd to be nothing but bustle. A wealthy Nabob was Godpapa, And an Indian Begum was Godmamma, Whose jewels a Queen might covet— And the Priest was a Vicar, and Dean withal Of that Temple we see with a Golden Ball, And a Golden Cross above it. The Font was a bowl of American gold, Won by Raleigh in days of old, In spite of Spanish bravado; And the Book of Pray'r was so overrun With gilt devices, it shone in the sun Like a copy—a presentation one— Of Humboldt's “El Dorado.” Gold! and gold! and nothing but gold! The same auriferous shine behold Wherever the eye could settle! On the walls—the sideboard—the ceiling-sky— On the gorgeous footmen standing by, In coats to delight a miner's eye With seams of the precious metal. Gold! and gold! and besides the gold, The very robe of the infant told A tale of wealth in every fold, It lapp'd her like a vapour! So fine! so thin! the mind at a loss Could compare it to nothing except a cross Of cobweb with bank-note paper. Then her pearls—'twas a perfect sight, forsooth, To see them, like “the dew of her youth,” In such a plentiful sprinkle. Meanwhile, the Vicar read through the form, And gave her another, not overwarm, That made her little eyes twinkle. Then the babe was cross'd and bless'd amain! But instead of the Kate, or Ann, or Jane, Which the humbler female endorses— Instead of one name, as some people prefix, Kilmansegg, went at the tails of six, Like a carriage of state with its horses. Oh, then the kisses she got and hugs! The golden mugs and the golden jugs That lent fresh rays to the midges! The golden knives, and the golden spoons, The gems that sparkled like fairy boons, It was one of the Kilmansegg's own saloons, But look'd like Rundell and Bridge's! Gold! and gold! the new and the old! The company ate and drank from gold, They revell'd, they sang, and were merry; And one of the Gold Sticks rose from his chair, And toasted “the Lass with the golden hair” In a bumper of Golden Sherry. Gold! still gold! it rain'd on the nurse, Who—un-like Danäe—was none the worse! There was nothing but guineas glistening! Fifty were given to Doctor James, For calling the little Baby names, And for saying, Amen! The Clerk had ten, And that was the end of the Christening. HER CHILDHOOD. Our youth! our childhood! that spring of springs! 'Tis surely one of the blessedest things That nature ever invented! When the rich are wealthy beyond their wealth, And the poor are rich in spirits and health, And all with their lots contented! There's little Phelim, he sings like a thrush, In the selfsame pair of patchwork plush, With the selfsame empty pockets, That tempted his daddy so often to cut His throat, or jump in the water-butt— But what cares Phelim? an empty nut Would sooner bring tears to their sockets. Give him a collar without a skirt, (That's the Irish linen for shirt) And a slice of bread with a taste of dirt, (That's Poverty's Irish butter) And what does he lack to make him blest? Some oyster-shells, or a sparrow's nest, A candle-end, and a gutter. But to leave the happy Phelim alone, Gnawing, perchance, a marrowless bone, For which no dog would quarrel— Turn we to little Miss Kilmansegg, Cutting her first little toothy-peg With a fifty-guinea coral— A peg upon which About poor and rich Reflection might hang a moral. Born in wealth, and wealthily nursed, Capp'd, papp'd, napp'd, and lapp'd from the first On the knees of Prodigality, Her childhood was one eternal round Of the game of going on Tickler's ground Picking up gold—in reality. With extempore carts she never play'd, Or the odds and ends of a Tinker's trade, Or little dirt pies and puddings made, Like children happy and squalid; The very puppet she had to pet, Like a bait for the “Nix my Dolly” set, Was a Dolly of gold—and solid! Gold! and gold! 'twas the burden still! To gain the Heiress's early goodwill There was much corruption and bribery— The yearly cost of her golden toys Would have given half London's Charity Boys And Charity Girls the annual joys Of a holiday dinner at Highbury. Bon-bons she ate from the gilt cornet; And gilded queens on St. Bartlemy's day; Till her fancy was tinged by her presents— And first a Goldfinch excited her wish, Then a spherical bowl with its Golden fish, And then two Golden Pheasants. Nay, once she squall'd and scream'd like wild— And it shows how the bias we give to a child Is a thing most weighty and solemn:— But whence was wonder or blame to spring If little Miss K.,—after such a swing— Made a dust for the flaming gilded thing On the top of the Fish Street column? HER EDUCATION. According to metaphysical creed, To the earliest books that children read For much good or much bad they are debtors— But before with their A B C they start, There are things in morals, as well as art, That play a very important part— “Impressions before the letters.” Dame Education begins the pile, Mayhap in the graceful Corinthian style, But alas for the elevation! If the Lady's maid or Gossip the Nurse With a load of rubbish, or something worse, Have made a rotten foundation. Even thus with little Miss Kilmansegg, Before she learnt her E for egg, Ere her Governess came, or her masters— Teachers of quite a different kind Had “cramm'd” her beforehand, and put her mind In a go-cart on golden castors. Long before her A B and C, They had taught her by heart her L. S. D. And as how she was born a great Heiress; And as sure as London is built of bricks, My Lord would ask her the day to fix, To ride in a fine gilt coach and six, Like Her Worship the Lady May'ress. Instead of stories from Edgeworth's page, The true golden lore for our golden age, Or lessons from Barbauld and Trimmer, Teaching the worth of Virtue and Health, All that she knew was the Virtue of Wealth, Provided by vulgar nursery stealth With a Book of Leaf Gold for a Primer. The very metal of merit they told, And praised her for being as “good as gold!” Till she grew as a peacock haughty; Of money they talk'd the whole day round, And weigh'd desert, like grapes, by the pound, Till she had an idea from the very sound That people with nought were naughty They praised—poor children with nothing at all! Lord! how you twaddle and waddle and squall Like common-bred geese and ganders! What sad little bad little figures you make To the rich Miss K., whose plainest seed-cake Was stuff'd with corianders! They praised her falls, as well as her walk, Flatterers make cream cheese of chalk, They praised—how they praised—her very small talk, As if it fell from a Solon; Or the girl who at each pretty phrase let drop A ruby comma, or pearl full-stop, Or an emerald semi-colon. They praised her spirit, and now and then The Nurse brought her own little “nevy” Ben, To play with the future May'ress, And when he got raps, and taps, and slaps, Scratches, and pinches, snips, and snaps, As if from a Tigress, or Bearess, They told him how Lords would court that hand, And always gave him to understand, While he rubb'd, poor soul, His carroty poll, That his hair had been pull'd by “a Hairess.” Such were the lessons from maid and nurse, A Governess help'd to make still worse, Giving an appetite so perverse Fresh diet whereon to batten— Beginning with A B C to hold Like a royal playbill printed in gold On a square of pearl-white satin. The books to teach the verbs and nouns, And those about countries, cities, and towns, Instead of their sober drabs and browns, Were in crimson silk, with gilt edges;— Her Butler, and Enfield, and Entick—in short Her “Early Lessons” of every sort, Look'd like Souvenirs, Keepsakes, and Pledges. Old Johnson shone out in as fine array As he did one night when he went to the play; Chambaud like a beau of King Charle's day— Lindley Murray in like conditions— Each weary, unwelcome, irksome task, Appear'd in a fancy dress and a mask;— If you wish for similar copies, ask For Howell and James's Editions. Novels she read to amuse her mind, But always the affluent match-making kind That ends with Promessi Sposi, And a father-in-law so wealthy and grand, He could give cheque-mate to Coutts in the Strand; So, along with a ring and posy, He endows the Bride with Golconda off hand, And gives the Groom Potosi. Plays she perused—but she liked the best Those comedy gentlefolks always possess'd Of fortunes so truly romantic— Of money so ready that right or wrong It always is ready to go for a song, Throwing it, going it, pitching it strong— They ought to have purses as green and long As the cucumber call'd the Gigantic. Then Eastern Tales she loved for the sake Of the Purse of Oriental make, And the thousand pieces they put in it— But Pastoral scenes on her heart fell cold, For Nature with her had lost its hold, No field but the Field of the Cloth of Gold Would ever have caught her foot in it. What more? She learnt to sing, and dance, To sit on a horse, although he should prance, And to speak a French not spoken in France Any more than at Babel's building— And she painted shells, and flowers, and Turks, But her great delight was in Fancy Works That are done with gold or gilding. Gold! still gold!—the bright and the dead, With golden beads, and gold lace, and gold thread She work'd in gold, as if for her bread; The metal had so undermined her, Gold ran in her thoughts and fill'd her brain, She was golden-headed as Peter's cane With which he walk'd behind her. HER ACCIDENT. The horse that carried Miss Kilmansegg, And a better never lifted leg, Was a very rich bay, call'd Banker— A horse of a breed and a mettle so rare,— By Bullion out of an Ingot mare,— That for action, the best of figures, and air, It made many good judges hanker. And when she took a ride in the Park, Equestrian Lord, or pedestrian Clerk, Was thrown in an amorous fever, To see the Heiress how well she sat, With her groom behind her, Bob or Nat, In green, half smother'd with gold, and a hat With more gold lace than beaver. And then when Banker obtain'd a pat, To see how he arch'd his neck at that! He snorted with pride and pleasure! Like the Steed in the fable so lofty and grand, Who gave the poor Ass to understand, That he didn't carry a bag of sand, But a burden of golden treasure. A load of treasure?—alas! alas! Had her horse but been fed upon English grass, And shelter'd in Yorkshire spinneys, Had he scour'd the sand with the Desert Ass, Or where the American whinnies— But a hunter from Erin's turf and gorse, A regular thorough-bred Irish horse, Why, he ran away, as a matter of course, With a girl worth her weight in guineas! Mayhap 'tis the trick of such pamper'd nags To shy at the sight of a beggar in rags,— But away, like the bolt of a rabbit,— Away went the horse in the madness of fright, And away went the horsewoman mocking the sight— Was yonder blue flash a flash of blue light, Or only the skirt of her habit? Away she flies, with the groom behind,— It looks like a race of the Calmuck kind, When Hymen himself is the starter, And the Maid rides first in the fourfooted strife, Riding, striding, as if for her life, While the Lover rides after to catch him a wife, Although it's catching a Tartar. But the Groom has lost his glittering hat! Though he does not sigh and pull up for that— Alas! his horse is a tit for Tat To sell to a very low bidder— His wind is ruin'd, his shoulder is sprung, Things, though a horse be handsome and young, A purchaser will consider. But still flies the Heiress through stones and dust, Oh, for a fall, if fall she must, On the gentle lap of Flora! But still, thank Heaven! she clings to her seat— Away! away! she could ride a dead heat With the Dead who ride so fast and fleet, In the Ballad of Leonora! Away she gallops!—it's awful work! It's faster than Turpin's ride to York, On Bess that notable clipper! She has circled the Ring!—she crosses the Park! Mazeppa, although he was stripp'd so stark, Mazeppa couldn't outstrip her! The fields seem running away with the folks! The Elms are having a race for the Oaks At a pace that all Jockeys disparages! All, all is racing! the Serpentine Seems rushing past like the “arrowy Rhine,” The houses have got on a railway line, And are off like the first-class carriages! She'll lose her life! she is losing her breath! A cruel chase, she is chasing Death, As female shriekings forewarn her: And now—as gratis as blood of Guelph— She clears that gate, which has clear'd itself Since then, at Hyde Park Corner! Alas! for the hope of the Kilmanseggs! For her head, her brains, her body, and legs, Her life's not worth a copper! Willy-nilly, In Piccadilly, A hundred hearts turn sick and chilly, A hundred voices cry, “Stop her!” And one old gentleman stares and stands, Shakes his head and lifts his hands, And says, “How very improper!” On and on!—what a perilous run! The iron rails seem all mingling in one, To shut out the Green Park scenery! And now the Cellar its dangers reveals, She shudders—she shrieks—she's doom'd, she feels, To be torn by powers of horses and wheels, Like a spinner by steam machinery! Sick with horror she shuts her eyes, But the very stones seem uttering cries, As they did to that Persian daughter, When she climb'd up the steep vociferous hill, Her little silver flagon to fill With the magical Golden Water! “Batter her! shatter her! Throw and scatter her!” Shouts each stony-hearted chatterer! “Dash at the heavy Dover! Spill her! kill her! tear and tatter her! Smash her! crash her!” (the stones didn't flatter her!) “Kick her brains out! let her blood spatter her! Roll on her over and over!” For so she gather'd the awful sense Of the street in its past unmacadamized tense, As the wild horse overran it,— His four heels making the clatter of six, Like a Devil's tattoo, play'd with iron sticks On a kettle-drum of granite! On! still on! she's dazzled with hints Of oranges, ribbons, and colour'd prints, A Kaleidoscope jumble of shapes and tints, And human faces all flashing, Bright and brief as the sparks from the flints, That the desperate hoof keeps dashing! On and on! still frightfully fast! Dover-street, Bond-street, all are past! But—yes—no—yes!—they're down at last! The Furies and Fates have found them! Down they go with sparkle and crash, Like a Bark that's struck by the lightning flash— There's a shriek—and a sob— And the dense dark mob Like a billow closes around them! “She breathes!” “She don't!” “She'll recover!” “She won't!” “She's stirring! she's living, by Nemesis!” Gold, still gold! on counter and shelf! Golden dishes as plenty as delf; Miss Kilmansegg's coming again to herself On an opulent Goldsmith's premises! Gold! fine gold!—both yellow and red, Beaten, and molten—polish'd, and dead— To see the gold with profusion spread In all forms of its manufacture! But what avails gold to Miss Kilmansegg, When the femoral bone of her dexter leg Has met with a compound fracture? Gold may soothe Adversity's smart; Nay, help to bind up a broken heart; But to try it on any other part Were as certain a disappointment, As if one should rub the dish and plate, Taken out of a Staffordshire crate— In the hope of a Golden Service of State— With Singleton's “Golden Ointment.” HER PRECIOUS LEG. “As the twig is bent, the tree's inclined,” Is an adage often recall'd to mind, Referring to juvenile bias: And never so well is the verity seen, As when to the weak, warp'd side we lean, While Life's tempests and hurricanes try us. Even thus with Miss K. and her broken limb: By a very, very remarkable whim, She show'd her early tuition: While the buds of character came into blow With a certain tinge that served to show The nursery culture long ago, As the graft is known by fruition! For the King's Physician, who nursed the case, His verdict gave with an awful face, And three others concurr'd to egg it; That the Patient to give old Death the slip, Like the Pope, instead of a personal trip, Must send her Leg as a Legate. The limb was doom'd—it couldn't be saved! And like other people the patient behaved, Nay, bravely that cruel parting braved, Which makes some persons so falter, They rather would part, without a groan, With the flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone, They obtain'd at St. George's altar. But when it came to fitting the stump With a proxy limb—then flatly and plump She spoke, in the spirit olden; She couldn't—she shouldn't—she wouldn't have wood! Nor a leg of cork, if she never stood, And she swore an oath, or something as good, The proxy limb should be golden! A wooden leg! what, a sort of peg, For your common Jockeys and Jennies! No, no, her mother might worry and plague— Weep, go down on her knees, and beg, But nothing would move Miss Kilmansegg! She could—she would have a Golden Leg, If it cost ten thousand guineas! Wood indeed, in Forest or Park, With its sylvan honours and feudal bark, Is an aristocratic article: But split and sawn, and hack'd about town, Serving all needs of pauper or clown, Trod on! stagger'd on! Wood cut down Is vulgar—fibre and particle! And Cork!—when the noble Cork Tree shades A lovely group of Castilian maids, 'Tis a thing for a song or sonnet!— But cork, as it stops the bottle of gin, Or bungs the beer—the small beer—in, It pierced her heart like a corking-pin, To think of standing upon it! A Leg of Gold—solid gold throughout, Nothing else, whether slim or stout, Should ever support her, God willing! She must—she could—she would have her whim, Her father, she turn'd a deaf ear to him— He might kill her—she didn't mind killing! He was welcome to cut off her other limb— He might cut her all off with a shilling! All other promised gifts were in vain, Golden Girdle, or Golden Chain, She writhed with impatience more than pain, And utter'd “pshaws!” and “pishes!” But a Leg of Gold as she lay in bed, It danced before her—it ran in her head! It jump'd with her dearest wishes! “Gold—gold—gold! Oh, let it be gold!” Asleep or awake that tale she told, And when she grew delirious: Till her parents resolved to grant her wish, If they melted down plate, and goblet, and dish, The case was getting so serious. So a Leg was made in a comely mould, Of Gold, fine virgin glittering gold, As solid as man could make it— Solid in foot, and calf, and shank, A prodigious sum of money it sank; In fact 'twas a Branch of the family Bank, And no easy matter to break it. All sterling metal—not half-and-half, The Goldsmith's mark was stamp'd on the calf— 'Twas pure as from Mexican barter! And to make it more costly, just over the knee, Where another ligature used to be, Was a circle of jewels, worth shillings to see, A new-fangled Badge of the Garter! 'Twas a splendid, brilliant, beautiful Leg, Fit for the Court of Scander-Beg, That Precious Leg of Miss Kilmansegg! For, thanks to parental bounty, Secure from Mortification's touch, She stood on a Member that cost as much As a Member for all the County! HER FAME. To gratify stern ambition's whims, What hundreds and thousands of precious limbs On a field of battle we scatter! Sever'd by sword, or bullet, or saw, Off they go, all bleeding and raw,— But the public seems to get the lock-jaw, So little is said on the matter! Legs, the tightest that ever were seen, The tightest, the lightest, that danced on the green, Cutting capers to sweet Kitty Clover; Shatter'd, scatter'd, cut, and bowl'd down, Off they go, worse off for renown, A line in the Times, or a talk about town, Than the leg that a fly runs over! But the Precious Leg of Miss Kilmansegg, That gowden, goolden, golden leg, Was the theme of all conversation! Had it been a Pillar of Church and State, Or a prop to support the whole Dead Weight, It could not have furnish'd more debate To the heads and tails of the nation! East and west, and north and south, Though useless for either hunger or drouth,— The Leg was in everybody's mouth, To use a poetical figure, Rumour, in taking her ravenous swim, Saw, and seized on the tempting limb, Like a shark on the leg of a nigger. Wilful murder fell very dead; Debates in the House were hardly read; In vain the Police Reports were fed With Irish riots and rumpuses— The Leg! the Leg! was the great event, Through every circle in life it went, Like the leg of a pair of compasses. The last new Novel seem'd tame and flat, The Leg, a novelty newer than that, Had tripp'd up the heels of Fiction! It Burked the very essays of Burke, And, alas! how Wealth over Wit plays the Turk! As a regular piece of goldsmith's work, Got the better of Goldsmith's diction. “A leg of gold! what of solid gold?” Cried rich and poor, and young and old,— And Master and Miss and Madam— 'Twas the talk of 'Change—the Alley—the Bank— And with men of scientific rank, It made as much stir as the fossil shank Of a Lizard coeval with Adam! Of course with Greenwich and Chelsea elves, Men who had lost a limb themselves, Its interest did not dwindle— But Bill, and Ben, and Jack, and Tom Could hardly have spun more yarns therefrom, If the leg had been a spindle. Meanwhile the story went to and fro, Till, gathering like the ball of snow, By the time it got to Stratford-le-Bow, Through Exaggeration's touches, The Heiress and Hope of the Kilmanseggs Was propp'd on two fine Golden Legs, And a pair of Golden Crutches! Never had Leg so great a run! 'Twas the “go” and the “Kick” thrown into one! The mode—the new thing under the sun, The rage—the fancy—the passion! Bonnets were named, and hats were worn, A la Golden Leg instead of Leghorn, And stockings and shoes, Of golden hues, Took the lead in the walks of fashion! The Golden Leg had a vast career, It was sung and danced—and to show how near Low Folly to lofty approaches, Down to society's very dregs, The Belles of Wapping wore “Kilmanseggs,” And St. Giles's Beaux sported Golden Legs In their pinchbeck pins and brooches! HER FIRST STEP. Supposing the Trunk and Limbs of Man Shared, on the allegorical plan, By the Passions that mark Humanity, Whichever might claim the head, or heart, The stomach, or any other part, The Legs would be seized by Vanity. There's Bardus, a ix-foot column of fop, A lighthouse without any light atop, Whose height would attract beholders, If he had not lost some inches clear By looking down at his kerseymere, Ogling the limbs he holds so dear, Till he got a stoop in his shoulders. Talk of Art, of Science, or Books, And down go the everlasting looks, To his crural beauties so wedded! Try him, wherever you will, you find His mind in his legs, and his legs in his mind, All prongs and folly—in short a kind Of fork—that is Fiddle-headed. What wonder, then, if Miss Kilmansegg, With a splendid, brilliant, beautiful leg, Fit for the court of Scander-Beg, Disdain'd to hide it like Joan or Meg, In petticoats stuffd or quilted? Not she! 'twas her convalescent whim To dazzle the world with her precious limb,— Nay, to go a little high-kilted. So cards were sent for that sort of mob Where Tartars and Africans hob-and-nob, And the Cherokee talks of his cab and cob To Polish or Lapland lovers— Cards like that hieroglyphical call To a geographical Fancy Ball On the recent Post-Office covers. For if Lion-hunters—and great ones too— Would mob a savage from Latakoo, Or squeeze for a glimpse of Prince Le Boo, That unfortunate Sandwich scion— Hundreds of first-rate people, no doubt, Would gladly, madly, rush to a rout, That promised a Golden Lion! HER FANCY BALL. Of all the spirits of evil fame, That hurt the soul or injure the frame, And poison what's honest and hearty, There's none more needs a Matthew to preach A cooling, antiphlogistic speech, To praise and enforce A temperate course, Than the Evil Spirit of Party. Go to the House of Commons, or Lords, And they seem to be busy with simple words In their popular sense or pedantic— But, alas! with their cheers, and sneers, and jeers, They're really busy, whatever appears, Putting peas in each other's ears, To drive their enemies frantic! Thus Tories like to worry the Whigs, Who treat them in turn like Schwalbach pigs, Giving them lashes, thrashes, and digs, With their writhing and pain delighted— But after all that's said, and more, The malice and spite of Party are poor To the malice and spite of a party next door, To a party not invited. On with the cap and out with the light, Weariness bids the world good night, At least for the usual season; But hark! a clatter of horses' heels; And Sleep and Silence are broken on wheels, Like Wilful Murder and Treason! Another crash—and the carriage goes— Again poor Weariness seeks the repose That Nature demands, imperious; But Echo takes up the burden now, With a rattling chorus of row-de-dow-dow, Till Silence herself seems making a row, Like a Quaker gone delirious! 'Tis night—a winter night—and the stars Are shining like winkin'—Venus and Mars Are rolling along in their golden cars Through the sky's serene expansion— But vainly the stars dispense their rays, Venus and Mars are lost in the blaze Of the Kilmanseggs' luminous mansion! Up jumps Fear in a terrible fright! His bedchamber windows look so bright,— With light all the Square is glutted! Up he jumps, like a sole from the pan, And a tremor sickens his inward man, For he feels as only a gentleman can, Who thinks he's being “gutted.’ Again Fear settles, all snug and warm But only to dream of a dreadful storm From Autumn's sulphurous locker; But the only electrical body that falls, Wears a negative coat, and positive smalls, And draws the peal that so appals From the Kilmanseggs' brazen knocker! 'Tis Curiosity's Benefit night— And perchance 'tis the English-Second-Sight, But whatever it be, so be it— As the friends and guests of Miss Kilmansegg Crowd in to look at her Golden Leg, As many more Mob round the door, To see them going to see it! In they go—in jackets, and cloaks, Plumes, and bonnets, turbans, and toques, As if to a Congress of Nations: Greeks and Malays, with daggers and dirks, Spaniards, Jews, Chinese, and Turks— Some like original foreign works, But mostly like bad translations. In they go, and to work like a pack, Juan, Moses, and Shacabac, Tom, and Jerry, and Springheel'd Jack,— For some of low Fancy are lovers— Skirting, zigzagging, casting about, Here and there, and in and out, With a crush, and a rush, for a full-bodied rout In one of the stiffest of covers. In they went, and hunted about, Open mouth'd like chub and trout, And some with the upper lip thrust out, Like that fish for routing, a barbel— While Sir Jacob stood to welcome the crowd, And rubb'd his hands, and smiled aloud, And bow'd, and bow'd, and bow'd, and bow'd, Like a man who is sawing marble. For Princes were there, and Noble Peers; Dukes descended from Norman spears; Earls that dated from early years; And Lords in vast variety— Besides the Gentry both new and old— For people who stand on legs of gold, Are sure to stand well with society. “But where—where—where?” with one accord, Cried Moses and Mufti, Jack and my Lord, Wang-Fong and Il Bondocani— When slow, and heavy, and dead as a dump, They heard a foot begin to stump, Thump! lump! Lump! thump! Like the Spectre in “Don Giovanni!” And lo! the Heiress, Miss Kilmansegg, With her splendid, brilliant, beautiful leg, In the garb of a Goddess olden— Like chaste Diana going to hunt, With a golden spear—which of course was blunt, And a tunic loop'd up to a gem in front, To show the Leg that was Golden! Gold! still gold; her Crescent behold, That should be silver, but would be gold; And her robe's auriferous spangles! Her golden stomacher—how she would melt! Her golden quiver, and golden belt, Where a golden bugle dangles! And her jewell'd Garter! Oh, Sin, oh, Shame! Let Pride and Vanity bear the blame, That bring such blots on female fame! But to be a true recorder, Besides its thin transparent stuff, The tunic was loop'd quite high enough To give a glimpse of the Order! But what have sin or shame to do With a Golden Leg—and a stout one too? Away with all Prudery's panics! That the precious metal, by thick and thin, Will cover square acres of land or sin, Is a fact made plain Again and again, In Morals as well as Mechanics. A few, indeed, of her proper sex, Who seem'd to feel her foot on their necks, And fear'd their charms would meet with checks From so rare and splendid a blazon— A few cried “fie!”—and “forward”—and “bold!” And said of the Leg it might be gold, But to them it look'd like brazen! 'Twas hard they hinted for flesh and blood, Virtue and Beauty, and all that's good, To strike to mere dross their topgallants— But what were Beauty, or Virtue, or Worth, Gentle manners, or gentle birth, Nay, what the most talented head on earth To a Leg worth fifty Talents! But the men sang quite another hymn Of glory and praise to the precious Limb— Age, sordid Age, admired the whim, And its indecorum pardon'd— While half of the young—ay, more than half— Bow'd down and worshipp'd the Golden Calf, Like the Jews when their hearts were harden'd. A Golden Leg!—what fancies it fired! What golden wishes and hopes inspired! To give but a mere abridgment— What a leg to leg-bail Embarrassment's serf! What a leg for a Leg to take on the turf! What a leg for a marching regiment! A golden Leg!—whatever Love sings, 'Twas worth a bushel of “Plain Gold Rings” With which the Romantic wheedles. 'Twas worth all the legs in stockings and socks— 'Twas a leg that might be put in the Stocks, N.B.—Not the parish beadle's! And Lady K. nid-nodded her head, Lapp'd in a turban fancy-bred, Just like a love-apple, huge and red, Some Mussul-womanish mystery; But whatever she meant To represent, She talk'd like the Muse of History. She told how the filial leg was lost; And then how much the gold one cost; With its weight to a Trojan fraction: And how it took off, and how it put on; And call'd on Devil, Duke, and Don, Mahomet, Moses, and Prester John, To notice its beautiful action. And then of the Leg she went in quest; And led it where the light was best; And made it lay itself up to rest In postures for painter's studies: It cost more tricks and trouble by half, Than it takes to exhibit a six-legg'd Calf To a boothful of country Cuddies. Nor yet did the Heiress herself omit The arts that help to make a hit, And preserve a prominent station, She talk'd and laugh'd far more than her share; And took a part in “Rich and Rare Were the gems she wore”—and the gems were there, Like a Song with an Illustration. She even stood up with a Count of France To dance—alas! the measures we dance When Vanity plays the Piper! Vanity, Vanity, apt to betray, And lead all sorts of legs astray, Wood, or metal, or human clay,— Since Satan first play'd the Viper! But first she doff'd her hunting gear, And favour'd Tom Tug with her golden spear To row with down the river— A Bonze had her golden bow to hold; A Hermit her belt and bugle of gold; And an Abbot her golden quiver. And then a space was clear'd on the floor, And she walk'd the Minuet de la Cour. With all the pomp of a Pompadour, But although she began andante, Conceive the faces of all the Rout, When she finished off with a whirligig bout, And the Precious Leg stuck stiffly out Like the leg of a Figuranté. So the courtly dance was goldenly done, And golden opinions, of course, it won From all different sorts of people— Chiming, ding-dong, with flattering phrase, In one vociferous peal of praise, Like the peal that rings on Royal days From Loyalty's parish-steeple. And yet, had the leg been one of those That danced for bread in flesh-colour'd hose, With Rosina's pastoral bevy, The jeers it had met,—the shouts! the scoff! The cutting advice to “take itself off,” For sounding but half so heavy. Had it been a leg like those, perchance, That teach little girls and boys to dance, To set, poussette, recede, and advance, With the steps and figures most proper,— Had it hopp'd for a weekly or quarterly sum, How little of praise or grist would have come To a mill with such a hopper! But the Leg was none of those limbs forlorn— Bartering capers and hops for corn— That meet with public hisses and scorn, Or the morning journal denounces— Had it pleased to caper from morn till dusk, There was all the music of “Money Musk” In its ponderous bangs and bounces. But hark;—as slow as the strokes of a pump, Lump, thump! Thump, lump! As the Giant of Castle Otranto might stump, To a lower room from an upper— Down she goes with a noisy dint, For taking the crimson turban's hint, A noble Lord at the Head of the Mint Is leading the Leg to supper! But the supper, alas! must rest untold, With its blaze of light and its glitter of gold, For to paint that scene of glamour, It would need the Great Enchanter's charm, Who waves over Palace, and Cot, and Farm, An arm like the Goldbeater's Golden Arm That wields a Golden Hammer. He—only HE—could fitly state THE MASSIVE SERVICE OF GOLDEN PLATE, With the proper phrase and expansion— The Rare Selection of FOREIGN WINES— The ALPS OF ICE and MOUNTAINS OF PINES, The punch in OCEANS and sugary shrines, The TEMPLE OF TASTE from GUNTER'S DESIGNS— In short, all that WEALTH with A FEAST combines, In a SPLENDID FAMILY MANSION. Suffice it each mask'd outlandish guest Ate and drank of the very best, According to critical conners— And then they pledged the Hostess and Host, But the Golden Leg was the standing toast, And as somebody swore, Walk'd off with more Than its share of the “Hips!” and honours! “Miss Kilmansegg!— Full glasses I beg!— Miss Kilmansegg and her Precious Leg!” And away went the bottle careering! Wine in bumpers! and shouts in peals! Till the Clown didn't know his head from his heels, The Mussulman's eyes danced two-some reels, And the Quaker was hoarse with cheering! HER DREAM. Miss Kilmansegg took off her leg, And laid it down like a cribbage-peg, For the Rout was done and the riot: The Square was hush'd; not a sound was heard; The sky was gray, and no creature stirr'd, Except one little precocious bird, That chirp'd—and then was quiet. So still without,—so still within;— It had been a sin To drop a pin— So intense is silence after a din, It seem'd like Death's rehearsal! To stir the air no eddy came; And the taper burnt with as still a flame, As to flicker had been a burning shame, In a calm so universal. The time for sleep had come at last; And there was the bed, so soft, so vast, Quite a field of Bedfordshire clover; Softer, cooler, and calmer, no doubt, From the piece of work just ravell'd out, For one of the pleasures of having a rout Is the pleasure of having it over. No sordid pallet, or truckle mean, Of straw, and rug, and tatters unclean; But a splendid, gilded, carved machine, That was fit for a Royal Chamber. On the top was a gorgeous golden wreath; And the damask curtains hung beneath, Like clouds of crimson and amber; Curtains, held up by two little plump things, With golden bodies and golden wings,— Mere fins for such solidities— Two Cupids, in short, Of the regular sort, But the housemaid call'd them “Cupidities.” No patchwork quilt, all seams and scars, But velvet, powder'd with golden stars, A fit mantle for Night-Commanders And the pillow, as white as snow undimm'd And as cool as the pool that the breeze has skimm'd, Was cased in the finest cambric, and trimm'd With the costliest lace of Flanders. And the bed—of the Eider's softest down, 'Twas a place to revel, to smother, to drown In a bliss inferr'd by the Poet; For if Ignorance be indeed a bliss, What blessed ignorance equals this, To sleep—and not to know it? Oh, bed! oh, bed! delicious bed! That heaven upon earth to the weary head; But a place that to name would be ill-bred, To the head with a wakeful trouble— 'Tis held by such a different lease! To one, a place of comfort and peace, All stuff'd with the down of stubble geese, To another with only the stubble! To one, a perfect Halcyon nest, All calm, and balm and quiet, and rest, And soft as the fur of the cony— To another, so restless for body and head, That the bed seems borrow'd from Nettlebed, And the pillow from Stratford the Stony! To the happy, a first-class carriage of ease, To the Land of Nod, or where you please; But alas! for the watchers and weepers, Who turn, and turn, and turn again, But turn, and turn, and turn in vain, With an anxious brain, And thoughts in a train, That does not run upon sleepers! Wide awake as the mousing owl, Night-hawk, or other nocturnal fowl,— But more profitless vigils keeping,— Wide awake in the dark they stare, Filling with phantoms the vacant air, As if that Crook-back'd Tyrant Care Had plotted to kill them sleeping. And oh! when the blessed diurnal light Is quench'd by the providential night, To render our slumber more certain! Pity, pity the wretches that weep, For they must be wretched, who cannot sleep When God himself draws the curtain! The careful Betty the pillow beats, And airs the blankets, and smooths the sheets, And gives the mattress a shaking— But vainly Betty performs her part, If a ruffled head and a rumpled heart, As well as the couch, want making. There's Morbid, all bile, and verjuice, and nerves, Where other people would make preserves, He turns his fruits into pickles: Jealous, envious, and fretful by day, At night, to his own sharp fancies a prey, He lies like a hedgehog roll'd up the wrong way, Tormenting himself with his prickles. But a child—that bids the world good night, In downright earnest and cuts it quite— A Cherub no Art can copy,— 'Tis a perfect picture to see him lie As if he had supp'd on a dormouse pie, (An ancient classical dish, by the by) With a sauce of syrup of poppy. Oh, bed! bed! bed! delicious bed! That heaven upon earth to the weary head, Whether lofty or low its condition! But instead of putting our plagues on shelves, In our blankets how often we toss ourselves, Or are toss'd by such allegorical elves As Pride, Hate, Greed, and Ambition! The independent Miss Kilmansegg Took off her independent Leg And laid it beneath her pillow, And then on the bed her frame she cast, The time for repose had come at last, But long, long, after the storm is past Rolls the turbid, turbulent billow. No part she had in vulgar cares That belong to common household affairs— Nocturnal annoyances such as theirs, Who lie with a shrewd surmising, That while they are couchant (a bitter cup!) Their bread and butter are getting up, And the coals, confound them, are rising. No fear she had her sleep to postpone, Like the crippled Widow who weeps alone, And cannot make a doze her own, For the dread that mayhap on the morrow, The true and Christian reading to baulk, A broker will take up her bed and walk, By way of curing her sorrow. No cause like these she had to bewail: But the breath of applause had blown a gale, And winds from that quarter seldom fail To cause some human commotion; But whenever such breezes coincide With the very spring-tide Of human pride, There's no such swell on the ocean! Peace, and ease, and slumber lost, She turn'd, and roll'd, and tumbled and toss'd, With a tumult that would not settle: A common case, indeed, with such As have too little, or think too much, Of the precious and glittering metal. Gold!—she saw at her golden foot The Peer whose tree had an olden root, The Proud, the Great, the Learned to boot, The handsome, the gay, and the witty— The Man of Science—of Arms—of Art, The man who deals but at Pleasure's mart And the man who deals in the City. Gold, still gold—and true to the mould! In the very scheme of her dream it told; For, by magical transmutation, From her Leg through her body it seem'd to go, Till, gold above, and gold below, She was gold, all gold, from her little gold toe To her organ of Veneration! And still she retain'd through Fancy's art, The Golden Bow, and Golden Dart, With which she had play'd a Goddess's part In her recent glorification: And still, like one of the self-same brood, On a Plinth of the self-same metal she stood For the whole world's adoration. And hymns and incense around her roll'd, From Golden Harps and Censers of Gold,— For Fancy in dreams is as uncontroll'd As a horse without a bridle: What wonder, then, from all checks exempt, If, inspired by the Golden Leg, she dreamt She was turn'd to a Golden Idol? HER COURTSHIP. When leaving Eden's happy land The grieving Angel led by the hand Our banish'd Father and Mother. Forgotten amid their awful doom, The tears, the fears, and the future's gloom, On each brow was a wreath of Paradise bloom, That our Parents had twined for each other. It was only while sitting like figures of stone, For the grieving Angel had skyward flown, As they sat, those Two in the world alone, With disconsolate hearts nigh cloven, That scenting the gust of happier hours, They look'd around for the precious flow'rs, And lo!—a last relic of Eden's dear bow'rs— The chaplet that Love had woven! And still, when a pair of Lovers meet, There's a sweetness in air, unearthly sweet, That savours still of that happy retreat Where Eve by Adam was courted: Whilst the joyous Thrush, and the gentle Dove, Woo'd their mates in the boughs above, And the Serpent, as yet, only sported. Who hath not felt that breath in the air, A perfume and freshness strange and rare, A warmth in the light, and a bliss everywhere, When young hearts yearn together? All sweets below, and all sunny above, Oh! there's nothing in life like making love, Save making hay in fine weather! Who hath not found amongst his flow'rs A blossom too bright for this world of ours. Like a rose among snows of Sweden? But to turn again to Miss Kilmansegg, Where must Love have gone to beg, If such a thing as a Golden Leg Had put its foot in Eden! And yet—to tell the rigid truth— Her favour was sought by Age and Youth— For the prey will find a prowler! She was follow'd, flatter'd, courted, address'd, Woo'd, and coo'd, and wheedled, and press'd, By suitors from North, South, East, and West, Like that Heiress, in song, Tibbie Fowler! But, alas! alas! for the Woman's fate, Who has from a mob to choose a mate! 'Tis a strange and painful mystery! But the more the eggs, the worse the hatch; The more the fish, the worse the catch; The more the sparks, the worse the match; Is a fact in Woman's history. Give her between a brace to pick, And, mayhap, with luck to help the trick, She will take the Faustus, and leave the Old Nick— But her future bliss to baffle, Amongst a score let her have a voice, And she'll have as little cause to rejoice, As if she had won the “Man of her choice” In a matrimonial raffle! Thus, even thus, with the Heiress and Hope, Fulfilling the adage of too much rope, With so ample a competition, She chose the least worthy of all the group, Just as the vulture makes a stoop, And singles out from the herd or troop The beast of the worst condition. A Foreign Count—who came incog., Not under a cloud, but under a fog, In a Calais packet's fore-cabin, To charm some lady British-born, With his eyes as black as the fruit of the thorn And his hooky nose, and his beard half-shorn, Like a half-converted Rabbin. And because the Sex confess a charm In the man who has slash'd a head or arm, Or has been a throat's undoing, He was dress'd like one of the glorious trade, At least when glory is off parade, With a stock, and a frock, well trimm'd with braid, And frogs—that went a-wooing. Moreover, as Counts are apt to do, On the left-hand side of his dark surtout, At one of those holes that buttons go through, (To be a precise recorder,) A ribbon he wore, or rather a scrap, About an inch of ribbon mayhap, That one of his rivals, a whimsical chap, Described as his “Retail Order.” And then—and much it help'd his chance— He could sing, and play first fiddle, and dance, Perform charades, and Proverbs of France— Act the tender, and do the cruel; For amongst his other killing parts, He had broken a brace of female hearts, And murder'd three men in duel! Savage at heart, and false of tongue, Subtle with age, and smooth to the young, Like a snake in his coiling and curling— Such was the Count—to give him a niche— Who came to court that Heiress rich, And knelt at her foot—one needn't say which— Besieging her castle of Sterling. With pray'rs and vows he open'd his trench, And plied her with English, Spanish, and French In phrases the most sentimental: And quoted poems in High and Low Dutch, With now and then an Italian touch, Till she yielded, without resisting much, To homage so continental. And then—the sordid bargain to close— With a miniature sketch of his hooky nose, And his dear dark eyes, as black as sloes, And his beard and whiskers as black as those, The lady's consent he requited— And instead of the lock that lovers beg, The Count received from Miss Kilmansegg A model, in small, of her Precious Leg— And so the couple were plighted! But, oh! the love that gold must crown! Better—better, the love of the clown, Who admires his lass in her Sunday gown, As if all the fairies had dress'd her! Whose brain to no crooked thought gives birth, Except that he never will part on earth With his true love's crooked tester! Alas! for the love that's link'd with gold! Better—better a thousand times told— More honest, happy, and laudable, The downright loving of pretty Cis, Who wipes her lips, though there's nothing amiss, And takes a kiss, and gives a kiss, In which her heart is audible! Pretty Cis, so smiling and bright, Who loves—as she labours—with all her might, And without any sordid leaven! Who blushes as red as haws and hips, Down to her very finger-tips, For Roger's blue ribbons—to her, like strips Cut out of the azure of Heaven! HER MARRIAGE. 'Twas morn—a most auspicious one! From the Golden East, the Golden Sun Came forth his glorious race to run, Through clouds of most splendid tinges; Clouds that lately slept in shade, But now seem'd made Of gold brocade, With magnificent golden fringes. Gold above, and gold below, The earth reflected the golden glow, From river, and hill, and valley; Gilt by the golden light of morn, The Thames—it look'd like the Golden Horn, And the Barge, that carried coal or corn. Like Cleopatra's Galley! Bright as clusters of Golden-rod, Suburban poplars began to nod, With extempore splendour furnish'd; While London was bright with glittering clocks, Golden dragons, and Golden cocks, And above them all, The dome of St. Paul, With its Golden Cross and its Golden Ball, Shone out as if newly burnish'd! And lo! for Golden Hours and Joys, Troops of glittering Golden Boys Danced along with a jocund noise, And their gilded emblems carried! In short, 'twas the year's most Golden Day, By mortals call'd the First of May, When Miss Kilmansegg, Of the Golden Leg, With a Golden Ring was married! And thousands of children, women, and men, Counted the clock from eight till ten. From St. James's sonorous steeple; For next to that interesting job, The hanging of Jack, or Bill, or Bob, There's nothing so draws a London mob As the noosing of very rich people. And a treat it was for the mob to behold The Bridal Carriage that blazed with gold! And the Footmen tall and the Coachman bold, In liveries so resplendent— Coats you wonder'd to see in place, They seem'd so rich with golden lace, That they might have been independent. Coats, that made those menials proud Gaze with scorn on the dingy crowd, From their gilded elevations; Not to forget that saucy lad (Ostentation's favourite cad), The Page, who look'd, so splendidly clad, Like a Page of the “Wealth of Nations.” But the Coachman carried off the state, With what was a Lancashire body of late Turn'd into a Dresden Figure; With a bridal Nosegay of early bloom, About the size of a birchen broom, And so huge a White Favour, had Gog been Groom He need not have worn a bigger. And then to see the Groom! the Count! With Foreign Orders to such an amount, And whiskers so wild—nay, bestial; He seem'd to have borrow'd the shaggy hair As well as the Stars of the Polar Bear. To make him look celestial! And then—Great Jove!—the struggle, the crush, The screams, the heaving, the awful rush, The swearing, the tearing, and fighting,— The hats and bonnets smash'd like an egg— To catch a glimpse of the Golden Leg, Which, between the steps and Miss Kilmansegg, Was fully display'd in alighting! From the Golden Ankle up to the Knee There it was for the mob to see! A shocking act had it chanced to be A crooked leg or a skinny: But although a magnificent veil she wore, Such as never was seen before, In case of blushes, she blush'd no more Than George the First on a guinea! Another step, and lo! she was launched! All in white, as Brides are blanched With a wreath of most wonderful splendour— Diamonds, and pearls, so rich in device, That, according to calculation nice, Her head was worth as royal a price, As the head of the Young Pretender. Bravely she shone—and shone the more As she sail'd through the crowd of squalid and poor, Thief, beggar, and tatterdemalion— Led by the Count, with his sloe-black eyes Bright with triumph, and some surprise, Like Anson on making sure of his prize The famous Mexican Galleon! Anon came Lady K., with her face Quite made up to act with grace, But she cut the performance shorter; For instead of pacing stately and stiff, At the stare of the vulgar she took a miff, And ran, full speed, into Church, as if To get married before her daughter. But Sir Jacob walk'd more slowly, and bow'd Right and left to the gaping crowd, Wherever a glance was seizable; For Sir Jacob thought he bow'd like a Guelph, And therefore bow'd to imp and elf, And would gladly have made a bow to himself, Had such a bow been feasible. And last—and not the least of the sight, Six “Handsome Fortunes,” all in white, Came to help in the marriage rite,— And rehearse their own hymeneals; And then the bright procession to close, They were followed by just as many Beaux Quite fine enough for Ideals. Glittering men, and splendid dames, Thus they enter'd the porch of St. James', Pursued by a thunder of laughter; For the Beadle was forced to intervene, For Jim the Crow, and his Mayday Queen, With her gilded ladle, and Jack i' the Green, Would fain have follow'd after! Beadle-like he hush'd the shout; But the temple was full “inside and out,” And a buzz kept buzzing all round about Like bees when the day is sunny— A buzz universal, that interfered With the rite that ought to have been revered, As if the couple already were smear'd With Wedlock's treacle and honey! Yet Wedlock's a very awful thing! 'Tis something like that feat in the ring, Which requires good nerve to do it— When one of a “Grand Equestrian Troop” Makes a jump at a gilded hoop, Not certain at all Of what may befall After his getting through it! But the count he felt the nervous work No more than any polygamous Turk, Or bold piratical skipper, Who, during his buccaneering search, Would as soon engage a hand in church As a hand on board his clipper! And how did the Bride perform her part? Like any bride who is cold at heart. Mere snow with the ice's glitter; What but a life of winter for her! Bright but chilly, alive without stir, So splendidly comfortless,—just like a Fir When the frost is severe and bitter. Such were the future man and wife! Whose bale or bliss to the end of life A few short words were to settle— “Wilt thou have this woman?” “I will”—and then, “Wilt thou have this man?” “I will,” and “Amen”— And those Two were one Flesh, in the Angels' ken, Except one Leg—that was metal. Then the names were sign'd—and kiss'd the kiss: And the Bride, who came from her coach a Miss, As a Countess walk'd to her carriage— Whilst Hymen preen'd his plumes like a dove, And Cupid flutter'd his wings above, In the shape of a fly—as little a Love As ever look'd in at a marriage! Another crash—and away they dash'd, And the gilded carriage and footmen flash'd From the eyes of the gaping people— Who turn'd to gaze at the toe-and-heel Of the Golden Boys beginning a reel, To the merry sound of a wedding-peal From St. James's musical steeple. Those wedding-bells! those wedding-bells! How sweetly they sound in pastoral dells From a tow'r in an ivy-green jacket! But town-made joys how dearly they cost; And after all are tumbled and tost, Like a peal from a London steeple, and lost In town-made riot and racket. The wedding-peal, how sweetly it peals With grass or heather beneath our heels,— For bells are Music's laughter!— But a London peal, well mingled, be sure, With vulgar noises and voices impure,— What a harsh and discordant overture To the Harmony meant to come after! But hence with Discord—perchance, too soon To cloud the face of the honeymoon With a dismal occultation!— Whatever Fate's concerted trick, The Countess and Count, at the present nick, Have a chicken, and not a crow, to pick At a sumptuous Cold Collation. A Breakfast—no unsubstantial mess, But one in the style of Good Queen Bess, Who,—hearty as hippocampus,— Broke her fast with ale and beef, Instead of toast and the Chinese leaf, And—in lieu of anchovy—grampus. A breakfast of fowl, and fish, and flesh, Whatever was sweet, or salt, or fresh; With wines the most rare and curious— Wines, of the richest flavour and hue; With fruits from the worlds both Old and New; And fruits obtain'd before they were due At a discount most usurious. For wealthy palates there be, that scout What is in season, for what is out, And prefer all precocious savour: For instance, early green peas, of the sort That costs some four or five guineas a quart; Where the Mint is the principal flavour. And many a wealthy man was there, Such as the wealthy City could spare, To put in a portly appearance— Men, whom their fathers had help'd to gild: And men, who had had their fortunes to build And—much to their credit—had richly fill'd Their purses by pursy-verance. Men, by popular rumour at least, Not the last to enjoy a feast! And truly they were not idle! Luckier far than the chesnut tits, Which, down at the door, stood champing their bits, At a different sort of bridle. For the time was come—and the whisker'd Count Help'd his Bride in the carriage to mount, And fain would the Muse deny it, But the crowd, including two butchers in blue, (The regular killing Whitechapel hue,) Of her Precious Calf had as ample a view, As if they had come to buy it! Then away! away! with all the speed That golden spurs can give to the steed,— Both Yellow Boys and Guineas, indeed, Concurr'd to urge the cattle— Away they went, with favours white, Yellow jackets, and panels bright, And left the mob, like a mob at night, Agape at the sound of a rattle. Away! away! they rattled and roll'd, The Count, and his Bride, and her Leg of Gold— That faded charm to the charmer! Away, through old Brentford rang the din, Of wheels and heels, on their way to win That hill, named after one of her kin, The Hill of the Golden Farmer! Gold, still gold—it flew like dust! It tipp'd the post-boy, and paid the trust; In each open palm it was freely thrust; There was nothing but giving and taking! And if gold could insure the future hour, What hopes attended that Bride to her bow'r, But alas! even hearts with a four-horse pow'r Of opulence end in breaking! HER HONEYMOON. The moon—the moon, so silver and cold, Her fickle temper has oft been told, Now shady—now bright and sunny— But of all the lunar things that change, The one that shows most fickle and strange, And takes the most eccentric range Is the moon—so call'd—of honey! To some a full-grown orb reveal'd, As big and as round as Norval's shield, And as bright as a burner Bude-lighted; To others as dull, and dingy, and damp, As any oleaginous lamp, Of the regular old parochial stamp, In a London fog benighted. To the loving, a bright and constant sphere, That makes earth's commonest things appear All poetic, romantic, and tender: Hanging with jewels a cabbage-stump, And investing a common post, or a pump, A currant-bush, or a gooseberry clump, With a halo of dreamlike splendour. A sphere such as shone from Italian skies, In Juliet's dear, dark, liquid eyes, Tipping trees with its argent braveries— And to couples not favour'd with Fortune's boons One of the most delightful of moons, For it brightens their pewter platters and spoons Like a silver service of Savory's! For all is bright, and beauteous, and clear, And the meanest thing most precious and dear When the magic of love is present: Love, that lends a sweetness and grace To the humblest spot and the plainest face— That turns Wilderness Row into Paradise Place, And Garlick Hill to Mount Pleasant! Love that sweetens sugarless tea, And makes contentment and joy agree With the coarsest boarding and bedding: Love, that no golden ties can attach, But nestles under the humblest thatch, And will fly away from an Emperor's match To dance at a Penny Wedding! Oh, happy, happy, thrice happy state, When such a bright Planet governs the fate Of a pair of united lovers! 'Tis theirs, in spite of the Serpent's hiss, To enjoy the pure primeval kiss, With as much of the old original bliss As mortality ever recovers! There's strength in double joints, no doubt, In double X Ale, and Dublin Stout, That the single sorts know nothing about— And a fist is strongest when doubled— And double aqua-fortis, of course, And double soda-water, perforce, Are the strongest that ever bubbled! There's double beauty whenever a Swan Swims on a Lake, with her double thereon; And ask the gardener, Luke or John, Of the beauty of double-blowing— A double dahlia delights the eye; And it's far the loveliest sight in the sky When a double rainbow is glowing! There's warmth in a pair of double soles; As well as a double allowance of coals— In a coat that is double-breasted— In double windows and double doors; And a double U wind is blest by scores For its warmth to the tender-chested. There's a twofold sweetness in double pipes: And a double barrel and double snipes Give the sportsman a duplicate pleasure: There's double safety in double locks; And double letters bring cash for the box; And all the world knows that double knocks Are gentility's double measure. There's a double sweetness in double rhymes, And a double at Whist and a double Times In profit are certainly double— By doubling, the Hare contrives to escape; And all seamen delight in a doubled Cape, And a double-reef'd topsail in trouble. There's a double chuck at a double chin, And of course there's a double pleasure therein, If the parties were brought to telling: And however our Dennises take offence, A double meaning shows double sense; And if proverbs tell truth, A double tooth Is Wisdom's adopted dwelling! But double wisdom, and pleasure, and sense, Beauty, respect, strength, comfort, and thence Through whatever the list discovers, They are all in the double blessedness summ'd, Of what was formerly double-drumm'd, The Marriage of two true Lovers! Now the Kilmansegg Moon, it must be told— Though instead of silver it tipp'd with gold— Shone rather wan, and distant, and cold, And before its days were at thirty, Such gloomy clouds began to collect, With an ominous ring of ill effect, As gave but too much cause to expect Such weather as seamen call dirty! And yet the moon was the “Young May Moon,” And the scented hawthorn had blossom'd soon, And the thrush and the blackbird were singing— The snow-white lambs were skipping in play, And the bee was humming a tune all day To flowers, as welcome as flowers in May, And the trout in the stream was springing! But what were the hues of the blooming earth, Its scents—its sounds—or the music and mirth Of its furr'd or its feather'd creatures, To a Pair in the world's last sordid stage, Who had never look'd into Nature's page, And had strange ideas of a Golden Age, Without any Arcadian features? And what were joys of the pastoral kind To a Bride—town-made—with a heart and a mind With simplicity ever at battle? A bride of an ostentatious race, Who, thrown in the Golden Farmer's place, Would have trimm'd her shepherds with golden lace, And gilt the horns of her cattle. She could not please the pigs with her whim, And the sheep wouldn't cast their eyes at a limb For which she had been such a martyr: The deer in the park, and the colts at grass, And the cows unheeded let it pass; And the ass on the common was such an ass, That he wouldn't have swapp'd The thistle he cropp'd For her Leg, including the Garter! She hated lanes and she hated fields— She hated all that the country yields— And barely knew turnips from clover; She hated walking in any shape, And a country stile was an awkward scrape, Without the bribe of a mob to gape At the Leg in clambering over! O blessed nature, “O rus! O rus!” Who cannot sigh for the country thus, Absorb'd in a worldly torpor— Who does not yearn for its meadow-sweet breath, Untainted by care, and crime, and death, And to stand sometimes upon grass or heath— That soul, spite of gold, is a pauper! But to hail the pearly advent of morn, And relish the odour fresh from the thorn, She was far too pamper'd a madam— Or to joy in the daylight waxing strong, While, after ages of sorrow and wrong, The scorn of the proud, the misrule of the strong, And all the woes that to man belong, The Lark still carols the self-same song That he did to the uncurst Adam! The Lark! she had given all Leipsic's flocks For a Vauxhall tune in a musical box; And as for the birds in the thicket, Thrush or ousel in leafy niche, The linnet or finch, she was far too rich To care for a Morning Concert, to which She was welcome without any ticket. Gold, still gold, her standard of old, All pastoral joys were tried by gold, Or by fancies golden and crural— Till ere she had pass'd one week unblest, As her agricultural Uncle's guest, Her mind was made up, and fully imprest, That felicity could not be rural! And the Count?—to the snow-white lambs at play, And all the scents and the sights of May, And the birds that warbled their passion, His ears and dark eyes, and decided nose, Were as deaf and as blind and as dull as those That overlook the Bouquet de Rose, The Huile Antique, And Parfum Unique, In a Barber's Temple of Fashion. To tell, indeed, the true extent Of his rural bias so far it went As to covet estates in ring fences— And for rural lore he had learn'd in town That the country was green, turn'd up with brown, And garnish'd with trees that a man might cut down Instead of his own expenses. And yet had that fault been his only one, The Pair might have had few quarrels or none, For their tastes thus far were in common; But faults he had that a haughty bride With a Golden Leg could hardly abide— Faults that would even have roused the pride Of a far less metalsome woman! It was early days indeed for a wife, In the very spring of her married life, To be chill'd by its wintry weather— But instead of sitting as Love-Birds do, On Hymen's turtles that bill and coo— Enjoying their “moon and honey for two” They were scarcely seen together! In vain she sat with her Precious Leg A little exposed, à la Kilmansegg, And roll'd her eyes in their sockets! He left her in spite of her tender regards, And those loving murmurs described by bards, For the rattling of dice and the shuffling of cards, And the poking of balls into pockets! Moreover he loved the deepest stake And the heaviest bets the players would make; And he drank—the reverse of sparely,— And he used strange curses that made her fret; And when he play'd with herself at piquet, She found, to her cost, For she always lost, That the Count did not count quite fairly. And then came dark mistrust and doubt, Gather'd by worming his secrets out, And slips in his conversations— Fears, which all her peace destroy'd, That his title was null—his coffers were void— And his French Château was in Spain, or enjoy'd The most airy of situations. But still his heart—if he had such a part— She—only she—might possess his heart, And hold his affections in fetters— Alas! that hope, like a crazy ship, Was forced its anchor and cable to slip When, seduced by her fears, she took a dip In his private papers and letters. Letters that told of dangerous leagues; And notes that hinted as many intrigues As the Count's in the “Barber of Seville”— In short such mysteries came to light, That the Countess-Bride, on the thirtieth night, Woke and started up in affright, And kick'd and scream'd with all her might, And finally fainted away outright, For she dreamt she had married the Devil! HER MISERY. Who hath not met with home-made bread, A heavy compound of putty and lead— And home-made wines that rack the head, And home-made liqueurs and waters? Home-made pop that will not foam, And home-made dishes that drive one from home, Not to name each mess, For the face or dress, Home-made by the homely daughters? Home-made physic that sickens the sick; Thick for thin and thin for thick;— In short each homogeneous trick For poisoning domesticity? And since our Parents, call'd the First, A little family squabble nurst, Of all our evils the worst of the worst Is home-made infelicity. There's a Golden Bird that claps its wings, And dances for joy on its perch, and sings With a Persian exultation: For the Sun is shining into the room, And brightens up the carpet-bloom, As if it were new, bran new, from the loom, Or the lone Nun's fabrication. And thence the glorious radiance flames On pictures in massy gilded frames— Enshrining, however, no painted Dames, But portraits of colts and fillies— Pictures hanging on walls, which shine, In spite of the bard's familiar line, With clusters of “Gilded lilies.” And still the flooding sunlight shares Its lustre with gilded sofas and chairs, That shine as if freshly burnish'd— And gilded tables, with glittering stocks Of gilded china, and golden clocks, Toy, and trinket, and musical box, That Peace and Paris have furnish'd. And lo! with the brightest gleam of all The glowing sunbeam is seen to fall On an object as rare as splendid— The golden foot of the Golden Leg Of the Countess—once Miss Kilmansegg— But there all sunshine is ended. Her cheek is pale, and her eye is dim, And downward cast, yet not at the limb, Once the centre of all speculation; But downward drooping in comfort's dearth, As gloomy thoughts are drawn to the earth— Whence human sorrows derive their birth— By a moral gravitation. Her golden hair is out of its braids, And her sighs betray the gloomy shades That her evil planet revolves in— And tears are falling that catch a gleam So bright as they drop in the sunny beam, That tears of aqua regia they seem, The water that gold dissolves in; Yet, not in filial grief were shed Those tears for a mother's insanity; Nor yet because her father was dead, For the bowing Sir Jacob had bow'd his head To Death—with his usual urbanity; The waters that down her visage rill'd Were drops of unrectified spirit distill'd From the limbeck of Pride and Vanity. Tears that fell alone and uncheckt, Without relief, and without respect, Like the fabled pearls that the pigs neglect, When pigs have that opportunity— And of all the griefs that mortals share, The one that seems the hardest to bear Is the grief without community. How bless'd the heart that has a friend A sympathising ear to lend To troubles too great to smother! For as ale and porter, when flat, are restored Till a sparkling bubbling head they afford, So sorrow is cheer'd by being pour'd From one vessel into another. But friend or gossip she had not one To hear the vile deeds that the Count had done, How night after night he rambled; And how she had learn'd by sad degrees That he drank, and smoked, and worse than these, That he “swindled, intrigued, and gambled.” How he kiss'd the maids, and sparr'd with John; And came to bed with his garments on; With other offences as heinous— And brought strange gentlemen home to dine, That he said were in the Fancy Line, And they fancied spirits instead of wine, And call'd her lap-dog “Wenus.” Of “making a book” how he made a stir, But never had written a line to her, Once his idol and Cara Sposa: And how he had storm'd, and treated her ill, Because she refused to go down to a mill, She didn't know where, but remember'd still That the Miller's name was Mendoza. How often he waked her up at night, And oftener still by the morning light, Reeling home from his haunts unlawful; Singing songs that shouldn't be sung, Except by beggars and thieves unhung— Or volleying oaths, that a foreign tongue Made still more horrid and awful! How oft, instead of otto of rose, With vulgar smells he offended her nose, From gin, tobacco, and onion! And then how wildly he used to stare! And shake his fist at nothing, and swear,— And pluck by the handful his shaggy hair, Till he look'd like a study of Giant Despair For a new Edition of Bunyan! For dice will run the contrary way, As well is known to all who play, And cards will conspire as in treason: And what with keeping a hunting-box, Following fox— Friends in flocks, Burgundies, Hocks, From London Docks; Stultz's frocks, Manton and Nock's Barrels and locks, Shooting blue rocks, Trainers and jocks, Buskins and socks, Pugilistical knocks, And fighting-cocks, If he found himself short in funds and stocks, These rhymes will furnish the reason! His friends, indeed, were falling away— Friends who insist on play or pay— And he fear'd at no very distant day To be cut by Lord and by cadger, As one, who has gone, or is going, to smash, For his checks no longer drew the cash, Because, as his comrades explain'd in flash, “He had overdrawn his badger.” Gold, gold—alas! for the gold Spent where souls are bought and sold, In Vice's Walpurgis revel! Alas! for muffles, and bulldogs, and guns, The leg that walks, and the leg that runs,— All real evils, though Fancy ones, When they lead to debt, dishonour, and duns, Nay, to death, and perchance the devil! Alas! for the last of a Golden race! Had she cried her wrongs in the market-place, She had warrant for all her clamour— For the worst of rogues, and brutes, and rakes, Was breaking her heart by constant aches, With as little remorse as the Pauper, who breaks A flint with a parish hammer! HER LAST WILL. Now the Precious Leg while cash was flush, Or the Count's acceptance worth a rush, Had never excited dissension; But no sooner the stocks began to fall, Than, without any ossification at all, The limb became what people call A perfect bone of contention. For alter'd days brought alter'd ways, And instead of the complimentary phrase, So current before her bridal— The Countess, heard, in language low, That her Precious Leg was precious slow, A good 'un to look at but bad to go, And kept quite a sum lying idle. That instead of playing musical airs, Like Colin's foot in going up-stairs— As the wife in the Scottish ballad declares— It made an infernal stumping. Whereas a member of cork, or wood, Would be lighter and cheaper and quite as good, Without the unbearable thumping. P'raps she thought it a decent thing To show her calf to cobbler and king, But nothing could be absurder— While none but the crazy would advertise Their gold before their servants' eyes, Who of course some night would make it a prize, By a Shocking and Barbarous Murder. But spite of hint, and threat, and scoff, The Leg kept its situation: For legs are not to be taken off By a verbal amputation. And mortals when they take a whim, The greater the folly the stiffer the limb That stand upon it or by it— So the Countess, then Miss Kilmansegg, At her marriage refused to stir a peg, Till the Lawyers had fasten'd on her Leg As fast as the Law could tie it. Firmly then—and more firmly yet— With scorn for scorn, and with threat for threat, The Proud One confronted the Cruel: And loud and bitter the quarrel arose, Fierce and merciless—one of those, With spoken daggers, and looks like blows, In all but the bloodshed a duel! Rash, and wild, and wretched, and wrong, Were the words that came from Weak and Strong, Till madden'd for desperate matters, Fierce as tigress escaped from her den, She flew to her desk—'twas open'd—and then, In the time it takes to try a pen, Or the clerk to utter his slow Amen, Her Will was in fifty tatters! But the Count, instead of curses wild, Only nodded his head and smiled, As if at the spleen of an angry child; But the calm was deceitful and sinister! A lull like the lull of the treacherous sea— For Hate in that moment had sworn to be The Golden Leg's sole Legatee, And that very night to administer! HER DEATH. 'Tis a stern and startling thing to think How often mortality stands on the brink Of its grave without any misgiving: And yet in this slippery world of strife, In the stir of human bustle so rife, There are daily sounds to tell us that Life Is dying, and Death is living! Ay, Beauty the Girl, and Love the Boy, Bright as they are with hope and joy, How their souls would sadden instanter, To remember that one of those wedding bells, Which ring so merrily through the dells, Is the same that knells Our last farewells, Only broken into a canter! But breath and blood set doom at nought— How little the wretched Countess thought, When at night she unloosed her sandal, That the Fates had woven her burial-cloth, And that Death, in the shape of a Death's Head Moth, Was fluttering round her candle! As she look'd at her clock of or-molu, For the hours she had gone so wearily through At the end of a day of trial— How little she saw in her pride of prime The dart of Death in the Hand of Time— That hand which moved on the dial! As she went with her taper up the stair, How little her swollen eye was aware That the Shadow which follow'd was double! Or when she closed her chamber door, It was shutting out, and for evermore, The world—and its worldly trouble. Little she dreamt, as she laid aside Her jewels—after one glance of pride— They were solemn bequests to Vanity— Or when her robes she began to doff, That she stood so near to the putting off Of the flesh that clothes humanity. And when she quench'd the taper's light, How little she thought as the smoke took flight, That her day was done—and merged in a night Of dreams and duration uncertain— Or along with her own, That a Hand of Bone Was closing mortality's curtain! But life is sweet, and mortality blind, And youth is hopeful, and Fate is kind In concealing the day of sorrow; And enough is the present tense of toil— For this world is, to all, a stiffish soil— And the mind flies back with a glad recoil From the debts not due till to-morrow. Wherefore else does the Spirit fly And bid its daily cares good-bye, Along with its daily clothing? Just as the felon condemn'd to die— With a very natural loathing— Leaving the Sheriff to dream of ropes, From his gloomy cell in a vision elopes To a caper on sunny gleams and slopes, Instead of the dance upon nothing. Thus, even thus, the Countess slept, While Death still nearer and nearer crept, Like the Thane who smote the sleeping— But her mind was busy with early joys, Her golden treasures and golden toys; That flash'd a bright And golden light Under lids still red with weeping. The golden doll that she used to hug! Her coral of gold, and the golden mug! Her godfather's golden presents! The golden service she had at her meals, The golden watch, and chain, and seals, Her golden scissors, and thread, and reels, And her golden fishes and pheasants! The golden guineas in silken purse— And the Golden Legends she heard from her nurse Of the Mayor in his gilded carriage— And London streets that were paved with gold— And the Golden Eggs that were laid of old— With each golden thing To the golden ring At her own auriferous Marriage! And still the golden light of the sun Through her golden dream appear'd to run, Though the night, that roared without, was one To terrify seamen or gipsies— While the moon, as if in malicious mirth, Kept peeping down at the ruffled earth, As though she enjoy'd the tempest's birth, In revenge of her old eclipses. But vainly, vainly, the thunder fell, For the soul of the Sleeper was under a spell That time had lately embitter'd— The Count, as once at her foot he knelt— That foot, which now he wanted to melt! But—hush!—'twas a stir at her pillow she felt— And some object before her glitter'd. 'Twas the Golden Leg!—she knew its gleam! And up she started and tried to scream,— But ev'n in the moment she started— Down came the limb with a frightful smash, And, lost in the universal flash That her eyeballs made at so mortal a crash, The Spark, call'd Vital, departed! Gold, still gold! hard, yellow, and cold, For gold she had lived, and she died for gold— By a golden weapon—not oaken; In the morning they found her all alone— Stiff, and bloody, and cold as stone— But her Leg, the Golden Leg, was gone, And the “Golden Bowl was broken!” Gold—still gold! it haunted her yet— At the Golden Lion the Inquest met— Its foreman, a carver and gilder— And the Jury debated from twelve till three What the Verdict ought to be, And they brought it in as Felo de Se, “Because her own Leg had kill'd her!” HER MORAL. Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold! Bright and yellow, hard and cold, Molten, graven, hammer'd and roll'd; Heavy to get, and light to hold; Hoarded, barter'd, bought, and sold, Stolen, borrow'd, squander'd, doled: Spurn'd by the young, but hugg'd by the old To the very verge of the churchyard mould; Price of many a crime untold; Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold: Good or bad a thousand-fold! How widely its agencies vary— To save—to ruin—to curse—to bless— As even its minted coins express, Now stamp'd with the image of Good Queen Bess, And now of a Bloody Mary. 1842. THE FLOWER. Alone, across a foreign plain, The Exile slowly wanders, And on his Isle beyond the main With sadden'd spirit ponders: This lovely Isle beyond the sea, With all its household treasures; Its cottage homes, its merry birds, And all its rural pleasures: Its leafy woods, its shady vales, Its moors, and purple heather; Its verdant fields bedeck'd with stars His childhood loved to gather: When lo! he starts, with glad surprise, Home-joys come rushing o'er him, For “modest, wee, and crimson-tipp'd,” He spies the flower before him! With eager haste he stoops him down, His eyes with moisture hazy, And as he plucks the simple bloom, He murmurs, “Lawk-a-daisy!” THE LEE SHORE. Sleet! and Hail! and Thunder! And ye Winds that rave, Till the sands thereunder Tinge the sullen wave— Winds, that like a Demon, Howl with horrid note Round the toiling Seaman, In his tossing boat— From his humble dwelling, On the shingly shore, Where the billows swelling, Keep such hollow roar— From that weeping Woman, Seeking with her cries, Succour superhuman From the frowning skies— From the Urchin pining For his Father's knee— From the lattice shining— Drive him out to sea! Let broad leagues dissever Him from yonder foam— Oh, God! to think Man ever Comes too near his Home! ON A NATIVE SINGER. AFTER HEARING MISS ADELAIDE KEMBLE. As sweet as the bird that by calm Bendemeer Pours such rich modulations of tone, As potent, as tender, as brilliant, as clear,— Still her voice has a charm of its own. For lo! like the skylark when after its song It drops down to its nest from above, She reminds us, her home and her music belong To the very same soil that we love. RONDEAU. [To-day, it is my natal day] To-day, it is my natal day, And threescore years have passed away, While Time has turned to silver-gray My hairs. Pursuing pleasure, love, and fun, A longish course I've had to run, And, thanks to Fortune, I have won My hares. But now, exhausted in the race, No longer I can go the pace, And others must take up the chase, My heirs! TO MINERVA. FROM THE GREEK. My temples throb, my pulses boil, I'm sick of Song, and Ode, and Ballad— So Thyrsis, take the midnight oil, And pour it on a lobster salad. My brain is dull, my sight is foul, I cannot write a verse, or read,— Then Pallas take away thine Owl, And let us have a Lark instead. TO C. DICKENS, ESQ., ON HIS DEPARTURE FOR AMERICA. Pshaw, away with leaf and berry, And the sober-sided cup! Bring a goblet, and bright sherry, And a bumper fill me up! Though a pledge I had to shiver, And the longest ever was! Ere his vessel leaves our river, I would drink a health to Boz: Here's success to all his antics, Since it pleases him to roam, And to paddle o'er Atlantics, After such a sale at home! May he shun all rocks whatever! And each shallow sand that lurks, And his passage be as clever As the best among his works. SONNET. [The world is with me, and its many cares] The world is with me, and its many cares, Its woes—its wants—the anxious hopes and fears That wait on all terrestrial affairs— The shades of former and of future years— Foreboding fancies, and prophetic tears, Quelling a spirit that was once elate:— Heavens! what a wilderness the earth appears, Where Youth, and Mirth, and Health are out of date! But no—a laugh of innocence and joy Resounds, like music of the fairy race, And gladly turning from the world's annoy I gaze upon a little radiant face, And bless, internally, the merry boy Who “makes a son-shine in a shady-place.” A ROW AT THE OXFORD ARMS. “Glorious Apollo, from on high behold us.” —Old Song. As latterly I chanced to pass A Public House, from which, alas! The Arms of Oxford dangle! My ear was startled by a din, That made me tremble in my skin, A dreadful hubbub from within, Of voices in a wrangle— Voices loud, and voices high, With now and then a party-cry, Such as used in times gone by To scare the British border; When foes from North and South of Tweed— Neighbours—and of Christian creed— Met in hate to fight and bleed, Upsetting Social Order. Surprised, I turn'd me to the crowd, Attracted by that tumult loud, And ask'd a gazer, beetle-brow'd, The cause of such disquiet. When lo! the solemn-looking man, First shook his head on Burleigh's plan, And then, with fluent tongue, began His version of the riot: A row!—why yes,—a pretty row, you might hear from this to Garmany, And what is worse, it's all got up among the Sons of Harmony, The more's the shame for them as used to be in time and tune, And all unite in chorus like the singing-birds in June! Ah! many a pleasant chant I've heard in passing here along, When Swiveller was President a-knocking down a song; But Dick's resign'd the post, you see, and all them shouts and hollers Is 'cause two other candidates, some sort of larned scholars, Are squabbling to be Chairman of the Glorious Apollers! Lord knows their names, I'm sure I don't, no more than any yokel, But I never heard of either as connected with the vocal; Nay, some do say, although of course the public rumour varies, They've no more warble in 'em than a pair of hen canaries Though that might pass if they were dabs at t'other sort of thing, For a man may make a song, you know, although he cannot sing; But lork! it's many folk's belief they're only good at prosing, For Catnach swears he never saw a verse of their composing; And when a piece of poetry has stood its public trials, If pop'lar, it gets printed off at once in Seven Dials, And then about all sorts of streets, by every little monkey, It's chanted like the “Dog's Meat Man,” or “If I had a Donkey.” Whereas, as Mr. Catnach says, and not a bad judge neither, No ballad—worth a ha'penny—has ever come from either, And him as writ “Jim Crow,” he says, and got such lots of dollars, Would make a better Chairman for the Glorious Apollers. Howsomever that's the meaning of the squabble that arouses, This neighbourhood, and quite disturbs all decent Heads of Houses, Who want to have their dinners and their parties, as is reason In Christian peace and charity according to the season. But from Number Thirty-Nine—since this electioneering job, Ay, as far as Number Ninety, there's an everlasting mob; Till the thing is quite a nuisance, for no creature passes by, But he gets a card, a pamphlet, or a summut in his eye; And a pretty noise there is!—what with canvassers and spouters, For in course each side is furnish'd with its backers and its touters; And surely among the Clergy to such pitches it is carried, You can hardly find a Parson to get buried or get married; Or supposing any accident that suddenly alarms, If you're dying for a surgeon, you must fetch him from the “Arms;” While the Schoolmasters and Tooters are neglecting of their scholars, To write about a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers. Well, that, sir, is the racket; and the more the sin and shame Of them that help to stir it up, and propagate the same; Instead of vocal ditties, and the social flowing cup,— But they'll be the House's ruin, or the shutting of it up, With their riots and their hubbubs, like a garden full of bears, While they've damaged many articles and broken lots of squares, And kept their noble Club Room in a perfect dust and smother, By throwing Morning Heralds, Times, and Standards at each other; Not to name the ugly language Gemmen oughtn't to repeat, And the names they call each other—for I've heard 'em in the street— Such as Traitors, Guys, and Judases, and Vipers, and what not, For Pasley and his divers ain't so blowing-up a lot. And then such awful swearing!—for there's one of them that cusses Enough to shock the cads that hang on opposition 'busses; For he cusses every member that's agin him at the poll, As I wouldn't cuss a donkey, tho' it hasn't got a soul; And he cusses all their families, Jack, Harry, Bob or Jim, To the babby in the cradle, if they don't agree with him. Whereby, altho' as yet they have not took to use their fives, Or, according as the fashion is, to sticking with their knives, I'm bound there'll be some milling yet, and shakings by the collars, Afore they choose a Chairman for the Glorious Apollers! To be sure it is a pity to be blowing such a squall, Instead of clouds, and every man his song, and then his call— And as if there wasn't Whigs enough and Tories to fall out, Besides politics in plenty for our splits to be about,— Why, a Cornfield is sufficient, sir, as anybody knows, For to furnish them in plenty who are fond of picking crows— Not to name the Maynooth Catholics, and other Irish stews, To agitate society and loosen all its screws; And which all may be agreeable and proper to their spheres,— But it's not the thing for musicals to set us by the ears. And as to College larning, my opinion for to broach, And I've had it from my cousin, and he drive a college coach, And so knows the University, and all as there belongs, And he says that Oxford's famouser for sausages than songs, And seldom turns a poet out like Hudson that can chant, As well as make such ditties as the Free and Easies want, Or other Tavern Melodists I can't just call to mind— But it's not the classic system for to propagate the kind, Whereby it so may happen as that neither of them Scholars May be the proper Chairman for the Glorious Apollers! For my part in the matter, if so be I had a voice, It's the best among the vocalists I'd honour with the choice; Or a Poet as could furnish a new Ballad to the bunch; Or at any rate the surest hand at mixing of the punch; Cause why, the members meet for that and other tuneful frolics— And not to say, like Muffincaps, their Catichiz and Collec's. But you see them there Itinerants that preach so long and loud, And always takes advantage like the prigs of any crowd, Have brought their jangling voices, and as far as they can compass, Have turn'd a tavern shindy to a seriouser rumpus, And him as knows most hymns—altho' I can't see how it follers— They want to be the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers! Well, that's the row—and who can guess the upshot after all? Whether Harmony will ever make the “Arms” her House of call, Or whether this here mobbing—as some longish heads foretel it, Will grow to such a riot that the Oxford Blues must quell it. Howsomever, for the present, there's no sign of any peace, For the hubbub keeps a growing, and defies the New Police;— But if I was in the Vestry, and a leading sort of Man, Or a Member of the Vocals, to get backers for my plan, Why, I'd settle all the squabble in the twinkle of a needle, For I'd have another candidate—and that's the Parish Beadle, Who makes such lots of Poetry, himself, or else by proxy, And no one never has no doubts about his orthodoxy; Whereby—if folks was wise—instead of either of them Scholars, And straining their own lungs along of contradictious hollers, They'll lend their ears to reason, and take my advice as follers, Namely—Bumble for the Chairman of the Glorious Apollers!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VI. 1842. [Continued.] SPRING. A NEW VERSION. “Ham. The air bites shrewdly—it is very cold.Hor. It is a nipping and an eager air.” —Hamlet. “Come, gentle Spring! ethereal mildness come!” Oh! Thomson, void of rhyme as well as reason, How couldst thou thus poor human nature hum? There's no such season. The Spring! I shrink and shudder at her name! For why, I find her breath a bitter blighter! And suffer from her blows as if they came From Spring the Fighter. Her praises, then, let hardy poets sing, And be her tuneful laureates and upholders, Who do not feel as if they had a Spring Pour'd down their shoulders! Let others eulogise her floral shows, From me they cannot win a single stanza, I know her blooms are in full blow—and so's The Influenza. Her cowslips, stocks, and lilies of the vale, Her honey-blossoms that you hear the bees at, Her pansies, daffodils, and primrose pale, Are things I sneeze at! Fair is the vernal quarter of the year! And fair its early buddings and its blowings— But just suppose Consumption's seeds appear With other sowings! For me, I find, when eastern winds are high, A frigid, not a genial inspiration; Nor can, like Iron-Chested Chubb, defy An inflammation. Smitten by breezes from the land of plague, To me all vernal luxuries are fables, Oh! where's the Spring in a rheumatic leg, Stiff as a table's? I limp in agony,—I wheeze and cough; And quake with Ague, that Great Agitator; Nor dream, before July, of leaving off My Respirator. What wonder if in May itself I lack A peg for laudatory verse to hang on?— Spring mild and gentle!—yes, as Spring-heeled Jack To those he sprang on. In short, whatever panegyrics lie In fulsome odes too many to be cited, The tenderness of Spring is all my eye, And that is blighted! THE TURTLES. A FABLE. “The rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle.” —Byron. One day, it was before a civic dinner, Two London Aldermen, no matter which, Cordwainer, Girdler, Patten-maker, Skinner— But both were florid, corpulent, and rich, And both right fond of festive demolition, Set forth upon a secret expedition. Yet not, as might be fancied from the token, To Pudding Lane, Pie Corner, or the Street Of Bread, or Grub, or anything to eat, Or drink, as Milk, or Vintry, or Portsoken, But eastward to that more aquatic quarter, Where folks take water, Or bound on voyages, secure a berth For Antwerp or Ostend, Dundee or Perth, Calais, Boulogne, or any Port on earth! Jostled and jostling, through the mud, Peculiar to the Town of Lud, Down narrow streets and crooked lanes they dived, Past many a gusty avenue, through which Came yellow fog, and smell of pitch, From barge, and boat, and dusky wharf derived; With darker fumes, brought eddying by the draught, From loco-smoko-motive craft; Mingling with scents of butter, cheese, and gammons, Tea, coffee, sugar, pickles, rosin, wax, Hides, tallow, Russia-matting, hemp and flax, Salt-cod, red herrings, sprats, and kipper'd salmons, Nuts, oranges, and lemons, Each pungent spice, and aromatic gum, Gas, pepper, soaplees, brandy, gin, and rum; Alamode-beef and greens—the London soil— Glue, coal, tobacco, turpentine, and oil, Bark, assafœtida, squills, vitriol, hops, In short, all whiffs, and sniffs, and puffs, and snuffs, From metals, minerals, and dyewood stuffs, Fruits, victual, drink, solidities, or slops— In flasks, casks, bales, trucks, waggons, taverns, shops, Boats, lighters, cellars, wharfs, and warehouse-tops, That, as we walk upon the river's ridge, Assault the nose—below the bridge. A walk, however, as tradition tells, That once a poor blind Tobit used to choose, Because, incapable of other views, He met with “such a sight of smells.” But on, and on, and on, In spite of all unsavoury shocks, Progress the stout Sir Peter and Sir John, Steadily steering ship-like for the docks— And now they reach a place the Muse, unwilling, Recalls for female slang and vulgar doing, The famous Gate of Billing That does not lead to cooing— And now they pass that House that is so ugly A Customer to people looking “smuggley”— And now along that fatal Hill they pass Where centuries ago an Oxford bled, And proved—too late to save his life, alas!— That he was “off his head.” At last before a lofty brick-built pile Sir Peter stopp'd, and with mysterious smile Tingled a bell that served to bring The wire-drawn genius of the ring, A species of commercial Samuel Weller— To whom Sir Peter—tipping him a wink, And something else to drink— “Show us the cellar.” Obsequious bow'd the man, and led the way Down sundry flights of stairs, where windows small, Dappled with mud, let in a dingy ray— A dirty tax, if they were tax'd at all. At length they came into a cellar damp, With venerable cobwebs fringed around, A cellar of that stamp Which often harbours vintages renown'd, The feudal Hock, or Burgundy the courtly. With sherry, brown or golden, Or port, so olden, Bereft of body 'tis no longer portly— But old or otherwise—to be veracious— That cobwebb'd cellar, damp, and dim, and spacious, Held nothing crusty—but crustaceous. Prone, on the chilly floor, Five splendid Turtles—such a five! Natives of some West Indian shore, Were flapping all alive, Late landed from the Jolly Planter's yawl— A sight whereon the dignitaries fix'd Their eager eyes, with ecstacy unmix'd, Like fathers that behold their infants crawl, Enjoying every little kick and sprawl. Nay—far from fatherly the thoughts they bred, Poor loggerheads from far Ascension ferried! The Aldermen too plainly wish'd them dead And Aldermanbury'd! “There!” cried Sir Peter, with an air Triumphant as an ancient victor's, And pointing to the creatures rich and rare, “There's picters!” “Talk of Olympic Games! They're not worth mention; The real prize for wrestling is when Jack, In Providence or Ascension, Can throw a lively turtle on its back!” “Aye!” cried Sir John, and with a score of nods, Thoughtful of classical symposium, “There's food for Gods! There's nectar! there's ambrosium! There's food for Roman Emperors to eat— Oh, there had been a treat (Those ancient names will sometimes hobble us) For Helio-gobble-us!” “There were a feast for Alexander's Feast! The real sort—none of your mock or spurious!” And then he mention'd Aldermen deceased, And “Epicurius,” And how Tertullian had enjoy'd such foison; And speculated on that verdigrease That isn't poison. “Talk of your Spring, and verdure, and all that Give me green fat! As for your Poets with their groves of myrtles And billing turtles, Give me, for poetry, them Turtles there, A-billing in a bill of fare!” “Of all the things I ever swallow— Good, well-dressed turtle beats them hollow— It almost makes me wish, I vow, To have two stomachs, like a cow!” And lo! as with the cud, an inward thrill Upheaved his waistcoat and disturb'd his frill, His mouth was oozing and he work'd his jaw— “I almost think that I could eat one raw!” And thus, as “inward love breeds outward talk,” The portly pair continued to discourse; And then—as Gray describes of life's divorce,— With “longing lingering look” prepared to walk,— Having thro' one delighted sense, at least, Enjoy'd a sort of Barmecidal feast, And with prophetic gestures, strange to see, Forestall'd the civic Banquet yet to be, Its callipash and callipee! A pleasant prospect—but alack! Scarcely each Alderman had turn'd his back, When seizing on the moment so propitious, And having learn'd that they were so delicious To bite and sup, From praises so high flown and injudicious,— And nothing could be more pernicious! The turtles fell to work, and ate each other up! MORAL. Never, from folly or urbanity, Praise people thus profusely to their faces, Till quite in love with their own graces, They're eaten up by vanity! THE ELM TREE. A DREAM IN THE WOODS. “And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees.” —As You Like It. [PART I.] 'Twas in a shady Avenue, Where lofty Elms abound— And from a Tree There came to me A sad and solemn sound, That sometimes murmur'd overhead, And sometimes underground. Amongst the leaves it seem'd to sigh, Amid the boughs to moan; It mutter'd in the stem, and then The roots took up the tone; As if beneath the dewy grass The dead began to groan. No breeze there was to stir the leaves; No bolts that tempests launch, To rend the trunk or rugged bark; No gale to bend the branch; No quake of earth to heave the roots, That stood so stiff and staunch. No bird was preening up aloft, To rustle with its wing; No squirrel, in its sport or fear, From bough to bough to spring; The solid bole Had ne'er a hole To hide a living thing! No scooping hollow cell to lodge A furtive beast or fowl, The martin, bat, Or forest cat That nightly loves to prowl, Nor ivy nook so apt to shroud The moping, snoring owl. But still the sound was in my ear, A sad and solemn sound, That sometimes murmur'd overhead, And sometimes underground— 'Twas in a shady Avenue Where lofty Elms abound. O hath the Dryad still a tongue In this ungenial clime? Have Sylvan Spirits still a voice As in the classic prime— To make the forest voluble, As in the olden time? The olden time is dead and gone; Its years have fill'd their sum— And e'en in Greece—her native Greece— The Sylvan Nymph is dumb— From ash, and beech, and aged oak, No classic whispers come. From Poplar, Pine, and drooping Birch, And fragrant Linden Trees; No living sound E'er hovers round, Unless the vagrant breeze, The music of the merry bird, Or hum of busy bees. But busy bees forsake the Elm That bears no bloom aloft— The Finch was in the hawthorn-bush, The Blackbird in the croft; And among the firs the brooding Dove, That else might murmur soft. Yet still I heard that solemn sound, And sad it was to boot, From ev'ry overhanging bough, And each minuter shoot; From rugged trunk and mossy rind, And from the twisted root. From these,—a melancholy moan; From those,—a dreary sigh; As if the boughs were wintry bare, And wild winds sweeping by— Whereas the smallest fleecy cloud Was stedfast in the sky. No sign or touch of stirring air Could either sense observe— The zephyr had not breath enough The thistle-down to swerve, Or force the filmy gossamers To take another curve. In still and silent slumber hush'd All Nature seem'd to be: From heaven above, or earth beneath, No whisper came to me— Except the solemn sound and sad From that Mysterious Tree! A hollow, hollow, hollow sound, As is that dreamy roar When distant billows boil and bound Along a shingly shore— But the ocean brim was far aloof, A hundred miles or more. No murmur of the gusty sea, No tumult of the beach, However they may foam and fret, The bounded sense could reach— Methought the trees in mystic tongue Were talking each to each!— Mayhap, rehearsing ancient tales Of greenwood love or guilt, Of whisper'd vows Beneath their boughs; Or blood obscurely spilt; Or of that near-hand Mansion House A Royal Tudor built. Perchance, of booty won or shared Beneath the starry cope— Or where the suicidal wretch Hung up the fatal rope; Or Beauty kept an evil tryste, Insnared by Love and Hope. Of graves, perchance, untimely scoop'd At midnight dark and dank— And what is underneath the sod Whereon the grass is rank— Of old intrigues, And privy leagues, Tradition leaves in blank. Of traitor lips that mutter'd plots— Of Kin who fought and fell— God knows the undiscover'd schemes, The arts and acts of Hell, Perform'd long generations since, If trees had tongues to tell! With wary eyes, and ears alert, As one who walks afraid, I wander'd down the dappled path Of mingled light and shade— How sweetly gleam'd that arch of blue Beyond the green arcade! How cheerly shone the glimpse of Heav'n Beyond that verdant aisle! All overarch'd with lofty elms, That quench'd the light, the while, As dim and chill As serves to fill Some old Cathedral pile! And many a gnarlèd trunk was there, That ages long had stood, Till Time had wrought them into shapes Like Pan's fantastic brood; Or still more foul and hideous forms That Pagans carve in wood! A crouching Satyr lurking here— And there a Goblin grim— As staring full of demon life As Gothic sculptor's whim— A marvel it had scarcely been To hear a voice from him! Some whisper from that horrid mouth Of strange, unearthly tone; Or wild infernal laugh, to chill One's marrow in the bone. But no—it grins like rigid Death, And silent as a stone! As silent as its fellows be, For all is mute with them— The branch that climbs the leafy roof— The rough and mossy stem— The crooked root, And tender shoot, Where hangs the dewy gem. One mystic Tree alone there is, Of sad and solemn sound— That sometimes murmurs overhead, And sometimes underground— In all that shady Avenue, Where lofty Elms abound. PART II. The Scene is changed! No green Arcade, No Trees all ranged a-row— But scatter'd like a beaten host, Dispersing to and fro; With here and there a sylvan corse, That fell before the foe. The Foe that down in yonder dell Pursues his daily toil; As witness many a prostrate trunk, Bereft of leafy spoil, Hard by its wooden stump, whereon The adder loves to coil. Alone he works—his ringing blows Have banish'd bird and beast; The Hind and Fawn have canter'd off A hundred yards at least; And on the maple's lofty top, The linnet's song has ceased. No eye his labour overlooks, Or when he takes his rest; Except the timid thrush that peeps Above her secret nest, Forbid by love to leave the young Beneath her speckled breast. The Woodman's heart is in his work, His axe is sharp and good: With sturdy arm and steady aim He smites the gaping wood; From distant rocks His lusty knocks Re-echo many a rood. His axe is keen, his arm is strong; The muscles serve him well; His years have reach'd an extra span, The number none can tell; But still his lifelong task has been The Timber Tree to fell. Through Summer's parching sultriness, And Winter's freezing cold, From sapling youth To virile growth, And Age's rigid mould, His energetic axe hath rung Within that Forest old. Aloft, upon his poising steel The vivid sunbeams glance— About his head and round his feet The forest shadows dance; And bounding from his russet coat The acorn drops askance. His face is like a Druid's face, With wrinkles furrow'd deep, And tann'd by scorching suns as brown As corn, that's ripe to reap; But the hair on brow, and cheek, and chin, Is white as wool of sheep. His frame is like a giant's frame; His legs are long and stark; His arms like limbs of knotted yew; His hands like rugged bark; So he felleth still With right good will, As if to build an Ark! Oh! well within His fatal path The fearful Tree might quake Through every fibre, twig, and leaf, With aspen tremor shake; Through trunk and root, And branch and shoot, A low complaining make! Oh! well to Him the Tree might breathe A sad and solemn sound, A sigh that murmur'd overhead, And groans from underground; As in that shady Avenue Where lofty Elms abound! But calm and mute the Maple stands, The Plane, the Ash, the Fir, The Elm, the Beech, the drooping Birch, Without the least demur; And e'en the Aspen's hoary leaf Makes no unusual stir. The Pines—those old gigantic Pines, That writhe—recalling soon The famous Human Group that writhes With Snakes in wild festoon— In ramous wrestlings interlaced A Forest Läocoon— Like Titans of primeval girth By tortures overcome, Their brown enormous limbs they twine Bedew'd with tears of gum— Fierce agonies that ought to yell, But, like the marble, dumb. Nay, yonder blasted Elm that stands So like a man of sin, Who, frantic, flings his arms abroad To feel the Worm within— For all that gesture, so intense, It makes no sort of din! An universal silence reigns In rugged bark or peel, Except that very trunk which rings Beneath the biting steel— Meanwhile the Woodman plies his axe With unrelenting zeal! No rustic song is on his tongue, No whistle on his lips; But with a quiet thoughtfulness His trusty tool he grips, And, stroke on stroke, keeps hacking out The bright and flying chips. Stroke after stroke, with frequent dint He spreads the fatal gash; Till, lo! the remnant fibres rend, With harsh and sudden crash, And on the dull resounding turf The jarring branches lash! Oh! now the Forest Trees may sigh, The Ash, the Poplar tall, The Elm, the Beech, the drooping Birch, The Aspens—one and all, With solemn groan And hollow moan Lament a comrade's fall! A goodly Elm, of noble girth, That, thrice the human span— While on their variegated course The constant Seasons ran— Through gale, and hail, and fiery bolt, Had stood erect as Man. But now, like mortal Man himself, Struck down by hand of God, Or heathen Idol tumbled prone Beneath th' Eternal's nod, In all its giant bulk and length It lies along the sod!— Ay, now the Forest Trees may grieve And make a common moan Around that patriarchal trunk So newly overthrown; And with a murmur recognise A doom to be their own! The Echo sleeps: the idle axe, A disregarded tool, Lies crushing with its passive weight The toad's reputed stool— The Woodman wipes his dewy brow Within the shadows cool. No Zephyr stirs: the ear may catch The smallest insect-hum; But on the disappointed sense No mystic whispers come; No tone of sylvan sympathy, The Forest Trees are dumb. No leafy noise, nor inward voice, No sad and solemn sound, That sometimes murmurs overhead, And sometimes underground; As in that shady Avenue, Where lofty Elms abound! PART III. The deed is done: the Tree is low That stood so long and firm; The Woodman and his axe are gone, His toil has found its term; And where he wrought the speckled Thrush Securely hunts the worm. The Cony from the sandy bank Has run a rapid race, Through thistle, bent, and tangled fern, To seek the open space; And on its haunches sits erect To clean its furry face. The dappled Fawn is close at hand, The Hind is browsing near,— And on the Larch's lowest bough The Ousel whistles clear; But checks the note Within its throat, As choked with sudden fear! With sudden fear her wormy quest The Thrush abruptly quits— Through thistle, bent, and tangled fern The startled Cony flits; And on the Larch's lowest bough No more the Ousel sits. With sudden fear The dappled Deer Effect a swift escape; But well might bolder creatures start, And fly, or stand agape, With rising hair, and curdled blood, To see so grim a Shape! The very sky turns pale above; The earth grows dark beneath; The human Terror thrills with cold And draws a shorter breath— An universal panic owns The dread approach of Death! With silent pace, as shadows come, And dark as shadows be, The grisly Phantom takes his stand Beside the fallen Tree, And scans it with his gloomy eyes, And laughs with horrid glee— A dreary laugh and desolate, Where mirth is void and null, As hollow as its echo sounds Within the hollow skull— “Whoever laid this tree along, His hatchet was not dull! “The human arm and human tool Have done their duty well! But after sound of ringing axe Must sound the ringing knell; When Elm or Oak Have felt the stroke, My turn it is to fell! “No passive unregarded tree, A senseless thing of wood, Wherein the sluggish sap ascends To swell the vernal bud— But conscious, moving, breathing trunks That throb with living blood! “No forest Monarch yearly clad In mantle green or brown; That unrecorded lives, and falls By hand of rustic clown— But Kings who don the purple robe, And wear the jewell'd crown. “Ah! little recks the Royal mind, Within his Banquet Hall, While tapers shine and Music breathes And Beauty leads the Ball,— He little recks the oaken plank Shall be his palace wall! “Ah, little dreams the haughty Peer, The while his Falcon flies— Or on the blood-bedabbled turf The antler'd quarry dies— That in his own ancestral Park The narrow dwelling lies! “But haughty Peer and mighty King One doom shall overwhelm! The oaken cell Shall lodge him well Whose sceptre ruled a realm— While he, who never knew a home, Shall find it in the Elm! “The tatter'd, lean, dejected wretch, Who begs from door to door, And dies within the cressy ditch, Or on the barren moor, The friendly Elm shall lodge and clothe That houseless man and poor! “Yea, this recumbent rugged trunk, That lies so long and prone, With many a fallen acorn-cup, And mast, and firry cone— This rugged trunk shall hold its share Of mortal flesh and bone! “A Miser hoarding heaps of gold, But pale with ague-fears— A Wife lamenting love's decay, With secret cruel tears, Distilling bitter, bitter drops From sweets of former years— “A Man within whose gloomy mind Offence had deeply sunk, Who out of fierce Revenge's cup Hath madly, darkly drunk— Grief, Avarice, and Hate shall sleep Within this very trunk! “This massy trunk that lies along, And many more must fall— For the very knave Who digs the grave, The man who spreads the pall, And he who tolls the funeral bell, The Elm shall have them all! “The tall abounding Elm that grows In hedgerows up and down; In field and forest, copse and park, And in the peopled town, With colonies of noisy rooks That nestle on its crown. “And well th' abounding Elm may grow In field and hedge so rife, In forest, copse, and wooded park, And 'mid the city's strife, For, every hour that passes by Shall end a human life!” The Phantom ends: the shade is gone; The sky is clear and bright; On turf, and moss, and fallen Tree, There glows a ruddy light; And bounding through the golden fern The Rabbit comes to bite. The Thrush's mate beside her sits And pipes a merry lay; The Dove is in the evergreens; And on the Larch's spray The Fly-bird flutters up and down, To catch its tiny prey. The gentle Hind and dappled Fawn Are coming up the glade; Each harmless furr'd and feather'd thing Is glad, and not afraid— But on my sadden'd spirit still The Shadow leaves a shade. A secret, vague, prophetic gloom, As though by certain mark I knew the fore-appointed Tree, Within whose rugged bark This warm and living frame shall find Its narrow house and dark. That mystic Tree which breathed to me A sad and solemn sound, That sometimes murmur'd overhead, And sometimes underground; Within that shady Avenue Where lofty Elms abound. MORE HULLAH-BALOO. “Loud as from numbers without number.” —Milton. “You may do it extempore, for it's nothing but roaring.” Quince. Amongst the great inventions of this age, Which ev'ry other century surpasses, Is one,—just now the rage,— Call'd “Singing for all Classes”— That is, for all the British millions, And billions, And quadrillions, Not to name Quintilians, That now, alas! have no more ear than asses, To learn to warble like the birds in June, In time and tune, Correct as clocks, and musical as glasses! In fact, a sort of plan, Including gentleman as well as yokel, Public or private man, To call out a Militia,—only Vocal Instead of Local, And not designed for military follies, But keeping still within the civil border, To form with mouths in open order, And sing in volleys. Whether this grand harmonic scheme Will ever get beyond a dream, And tend to British happiness and glory, Maybe no, and maybe yes, Is more than I pretend to guess— However, here's my story. In one of those small, quiet streets, Where Business retreats, To shun the daily bustle and the noise The shoppy Strand enjoys, But Law, Joint-Companies, and Life Assurance Find past endurance— In one of those back streets, to Peace so dear, The other day, a ragged wight Began to sing with all his might, “I have a silent sorrow here!” The place was lonely; not a creature stirr'd Except some little dingy bird; Or vagrant cur that sniff'd along, Indifferent to the Son of Song; No truant errand-boy, or Doctor's lad, No idle filch or lounging cad, No Pots encumber'd with diurnal beer, No printer's devil with an author's proof, Or housemaid on an errand far aloof, Linger'd the tatter'd Melodist to hear— Who yet, confound him! bawl'd as loud As if he had to charm a London crowd, Singing beside the public way, Accompanied—instead of violin, Flute, or piano, chiming in— By rumbling cab, and omnibus, and dray, A van with iron bars to play staccato, Or engine obligato— In short, without one instrument vehicular (Not ev'n a truck, to be particular), There stood the rogue and roar'd, Unasked and unencored, Enough to split the organs call'd auricular! Heard in that quiet place, Devoted to a still and studious race, The noise was quite appalling! To seek a fitting simile and spin it, Appropriate to his calling, His voice had all Lablache's body in it; But oh! the scientific tone it lack'd, And was, in fact, Only a forty-boatswain-power of bawling! 'Twas said, indeed, for want of vocal nous, The stage had banish'd him when he attempted it, For tho' his voice completely fill'd the house, It also emptied it. However, there he stood Vociferous—a ragged don! And with his iron pipes laid on A row to all the neighbourhood. In vain were sashes closed And doors against the persevering Stentor, Though brick, and glass, and solid oak opposed, Th' intruding voice would enter, Heedless of ceremonial or decorum, Den, office, parlour, study, and sanctorum; Where clients and attorneys, rogues, and fools, Ladies, and masters who attended schools, Clerks, agents, all provided with their tools, Were sitting upon sofas, chairs, and stools, With shelves, pianos, tables, desks, before 'em— How it did bore 'em! Louder, and louder still, The fellow sang with horrible goodwill, Curses both loud and deep his sole gratuities, From scribes bewilder'd making many a flaw In deeds of law They had to draw; With dreadful incongruities In posting ledgers, making up accounts To large amounts, Or casting up annuities— Stunn'd by that voice, so loud and hoarse, Against whose overwhelming force No in-voice stood a chance, of course! The Actuary pshaw'd and pish'd, And knit his calculating brows, and wish'd The singer “a bad life”—a mental murther! The Clerk, resentful of a blot and blunder, Wish'd the musician further, Poles distant—and no wonder! For Law and Harmony tend far asunder— The lady could not keep her temper calm, Because the sinner did not sing a psalm— The Fiddler in the very same position As Hogarth's chafed musician (Such prints require but cursory reminders) Came and made faces at the wretch beneath, And wishing for his foe between his teeth, (Like all impatient elves That spite themselves) Ground his own grinders. But still with unrelenting note, Though not a copper came of it, in verity, The horrid fellow with the ragged coat, And iron throat, Heedless of present honour and prosperity, Sang like a Poet singing for posterity, In penniless reliance— And, sure, the most immortal Man of Rhyme Never set Time More thoroughly at defiance! From room to room, from floor to floor, From Number One to Twenty-four The Nuisance bellow'd, till all patience lost, Down came Miss Frost, Expostulating at her open door— “Peace, monster, peace! Where is the New Police! I vow I cannot work, or read, or pray, Don't stand there bawling, fellow, don't! You really send my serious thoughts astray, Do—there's a dear good man—do go away.” Says he, “I won't!” The spinster pull'd her door to with a slam, That sounded like a wooden d?n, For so some moral people, strictly loth To swear in words, however up, Will crash a curse in setting down a cup, Or through a doorpost vent a banging oath— In fact, this sort of physical transgression Is really no more difficult to trace Than in a given face A very bad expression. However, in she went, Leaving the subject of her discontent To Mr. Jones's Clerk at Number Ten; Who, throwing up the sash, With accents rash, Thus hail'd the most vociferous of men: “Come, come, I say old fellor, stop your chant! I cannot write a sentence—no one can't! So just pack up your trumps, And stir your stumps—” Says he, “I shan't!” Down went the sash As if devoted to “eternal smash” (Another illustration Of acted imprecation), While close at hand, uncomfortably near, The independent voice, so loud and strong, And clanging like a gong, Roar'd out again the everlasting song, “I have a silent sorrow here!” The thing was hard to stand! The Music-master could not stand it— But rushing forth with fiddle-stick in hand, As savage as a bandit, Made up directly to the tatter'd man, And thus in broken sentences began— But playing first a prelude of grimaces, Twisting his features to the strangest shapes, So that to guess his subject from his faces, He meant to give a lecture upon apes— “Com—com—I say! You go away! Into two parts my head you split— My fiddle cannot hear himself a bit, When I do play— You have no bis'ness in a place so still! Can you not come another day?” Says he—“I will.” “No—no—you scream and bawl! You must not come at all! You have no rights, by rights, to beg— You have not one off leg— You ought to work—you have not some complaint— You are not cripple in your back or bones— Your voice is strong enough to break some stones”— Says he—“It aint!” “I say you ought to labour! You are in a young case, You have not sixty years upon your face, To come and beg your neighbour, And discompose his music with a noise More worse than twenty boys— Look what a street it is for quiet! No cart to make a riot, No coach, no horses, no postilion, If you will sing, I say, it is not just To sing so loud.”—Says he, “I must! I'm singing for the million!” THE SEASON. Summer's gone and over! Fogs are falling down; And with russet tinges Autumn's doing brown. Boughs are daily rifled By the gusty thieves, And the Book of Nature Getteth short of leaves. Round the tops of houses, Swallows, as they flit, Give, like yearly tenants, Notices to quit. Skies, of fickle temper, Weep by turns, and laugh— Night and Day together Taking half-and-half. So September endeth— Cold, and most perverse— But the Month that follows, Sure will pinch us worse! LEAR. A poor old king, with sorrow for my crown, Throned upon straw, and mantled with the wind— For pity, my own tears have made me blind That I might never see my children's frown; And, may be, Madness, like a friend, has thrown A folded fillet over my dark mind, So that unkindly speech may sound for kind— Albeit I know not.—I am childish grown— And have not gold to purchase wit withal— I that have once maintain'd most royal state— A very bankrupt now that may not call My child my child—all beggar'd save in tears, Wherewith I daily weep an old man's fate, Foolish—and blind—and overcome with years! SONG. TO MY WIFE. Those eyes that were so bright, love, Have now a dimmer shine,— But all they've lost in light, love, Was what they gave to mine; But still those orbs reflect, love, The beams of former hours,— That ripen'd all my joys, my love, And tinted all my flowers! Those locks were brown to see, love, That now are turned so gray,— But the years were spent with me, love, That stole their hue away; Thy locks no longer share, love, The golden glow of noon,— But I've seen the world look fair, my love, When silver'd by the moon! That brow was smooth and fair, love, That looks so shaded now,— But for me it bore the care, love, That spoiled a bonny brow. And though no longer there, love, The gloss it had of yore,— Still Memory looks and dotes, my love, Where Hope admired before! 1843. THE FORGE. A ROMANCE OF THE IRON AGE. “Who's here, beside foul weather?” —King Lear. “Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me, Should have stood that night against my fire.” —Cordelia. PART I. Like a dead man gone to his shroud, The sun has sunk in a coppery cloud, And the wind is rising squally and loud With many a stormy token,— Playing a wild funereal air, Through the branches bleak, bereaved, and bare, To the dead leaves dancing here and there— In short, if the truth were spoken, It's an ugly night for anywhere, But an awful one for the Brocken! For oh! to stop On that mountain top, After the dews of evening drop, Is always a dreary frolic— Then what must it be when nature groans, And the very mountain murmurs and moans As if it writhed with the cholic— With other strange supernatural tones, From wood, and water, and echoing stones, Not to forget unburied bones— In a region so diabolic! A place where he whom we call old Scratch, By help of his Witches—a precious batch— Gives midnight concerts and sermons, In a Pulpit and Orchestra built to match, A plot right worthy of him to hatch, And well adapted, he knows, to catch The musical, mystical Germans! However it's quite As wild a night As ever was known on that sinister height Since the Demon-Dance was morriced— The earth is dark, and the sky is scowling, And the blast through the pines is howling and growling As if a thousand wolves were prowling About in the old Black Forest! Madly, sadly, the Tempest raves Through the narrow gullies and hollow caves, And bursts on the rocks in windy waves, Like the billows that roar On a gusty shore Mourning over the mariners' graves— Nay, more like a frantic lamentation From a howling set Of demons met To wake a dead relation. Badly, madly, the vapours fly Over the dark distracted sky, At a pace that no pen can paint! Black and vague like the shadows of dreams, Scudding over the moon that seems, Shorn of half her usual beams, As pale as if she would faint! The lightning flashes, The thunder crashes, The trees encounter with horrible clashes, While rolling up from marish and bog, Rank and rich, As from Stygian ditch, Rises a foul sulphureous fog, Hinting that Satan himself is agog,— But leaving at once this heroical pitch, The night is a very bad night in which You wouldn't turn out a dog. Yet ONE there is abroad in the storm, And whenever by chance The moon gets a glance, She spies the Traveller's lonely form, Walking, leaping, striding along, As none can do but the super-strong; And flapping his arms to keep him warm, For the breeze from the North is a regular starver, And to tell the truth, More keen, in sooth, And cutting than any German carver! However, no time it is to lag, And on he scrambles from crag to crag, Like one determined never to flag— Now weathers a block Of jutting rock, With hardly room for a toe to wag; But holding on by a timber snag, That looks like the arm of a friendly hag; Then stooping under a drooping bough, Or leaping over some horrid chasm, Enough to give any heart a spasm! And sinking down a precipice now, Keeping his feet the Deuce knows how, In spots whence all creatures would keep aloof, Except the Goat, with his cloven hoof, Who clings to the shallowest ledge as if He grew like the weed on the face of the cliff! So down, still down, the Traveller goes, Safe as the Chamois amid his snows, Though fiercer than ever the hurricane blows, And round him eddy, with whirl and whizz, Tornadoes of hail, and sleet, and rain, Enough to bewilder a weaker brain, Or blanch any other visage than his, Which spite of lightning, thunder, and hail, The blinding sleet and the freezing gale, And the horrid abyss, If his foot should miss, Instead of tending at all to pale, Like cheeks that feel the chill of affright— Remains—the very reverse of white! His heart is granite—his iron nerve Feels no convulsive twitches; And as to his foot, it does not swerve, Tho' the Screech-Owls are flitting about him that serve For parrots to Brocken Witches! Nay, full in his very path he spies The gleam of the Were Wolf's horrid eyes; But if his members quiver— It is not for that—no, it is not for that— Nor rat, Nor cat, As black as your hat, Nor the snake that hiss'd, nor the toad that spat, Nor glimmering candles of dead men's fat, Nor even the flap of the Vampire Bat, No anserine skin would rise thereat, It's the cold that makes Him shiver! So down, still down, through gully and glen, Never trodden by foot of men, Past the Eagle's nest, and the She-Wolf's den, Never caring a jot how steep Or how narrow the track he has to keep, Or how wide and deep An abyss to leap, Or what may fly, or walk, or creep, Down he hurries through darkness and storm, Flapping his arms to keep him warm— Till threading many a pass abhorrent, At last he reaches the mountain gorge, And takes a path along by a torrent— The very identical path, by St. George! Down which young Fridolin went to the Forge, With a message meant for his own death-warrant! Young Fridolin; young Fridolin! So free from sauce, and sloth, and sin, The best of pages Whatever their ages, Since first that singular fashion came in— Not he like those modern and idle young gluttons With little jackets, so smart and spruce, Of Lincoln green, sky-blue, or puce— A little gold lace you may introduce— Very showy, but as for use, Not worth so many buttons! Young Fridolin; young Fridolin! Of his duty so true a fulfiller— But here we need no farther go For whoever desires the Tale to know, May read it all in Schiller. Faster now the Traveller speeds, Whither his guiding beacon leads, For by yonder glare In the murky air, He knows that the Eisen Hutte is there! With its sooty Cyclops, savage and grim, Hosts, a guest had better forbear, Whose thoughts are set upon dainty fare— But stiff with cold in every limb, The Furnace Fire is the bait for Him! Faster and faster still he goes, Whilst redder and redder the welkin glows, And the lowest clouds that scud in the sky Get crimson fringes in flitting by. Till lo! amid the lurid light, The darkest object intensely dark, Just where the bright is intensely bright, The Forge, the Forge itself is in sight, Like the pitch-black hull of a burning bark, With volleying smoke, and many a spark, Vomiting fire, red, yellow, and white! Restless, quivering tongues of flame! Heavenward striving still to go, While others, reversed in the stream below, Seem seeking a place we will not name, But well that Traveller knows the same, Who stops and stands, So rubbing his hands, And snuffing the rare Perfumes in the air, For old familiar odours are there, And then direct by the shortest cut, Like Alpine Marmot, whom neither rut, Rivers, rocks, nor thickets rebut, Makes his way to the blazing Hut! PART II. Idly watching the Furnace-flames, The men of the stithy Are in their smithy, Brutal monsters, with bulky frames, Beings Humanity scarcely claims, But hybrids rather of demon race, Unbless'd by the holy rite of grace, Who never had gone by Christian names, Mark, or Matthew, Peter, or James— Naked, foul, unshorn, unkempt, From touch of natural shame exempt, Things of which Delirium has dreamt— But wherefore dwell on these verbal sketches, When traced with frightful truth and vigour, Costume, attitude, face, and figure, Retsch has drawn the very wretches! However, there they lounge about, The grim, gigantic fellows, Hardly hearing the storm without, That makes so very dreadful a rout, For the constant roar From the furnace door, And the blast of the monstrous bellows! Oh, what a scene That Forge had been For Salvator Rosa's study! With wall, and beam, and post, and pin, And those ruffianly creatures, like Shapes of Sin, Hair, and eyes, and rusty skin, Illumed by a light so ruddy The Hut, and whatever there is therein, Looks either red-hot or bloody! And, oh! to hear the frequent burst Of strange, extravagant laughter, Harsh and hoarse, And resounding perforce From echoing roof and rafter! Though curses, the worst That ever were curst, And threats that Cain invented the first, Come growling the instant after! But again the livelier peal is rung, For the Smith, hight Salamander, In the jargon of some Titanic tongue, Elsewhere never said or sung, With the voice of a Stentor in joke has flung Some cumbrous sort Of sledge-hammer retort At Red Beard, the crew's commander. Some frightful jest—who knows how wild, Or obscene, from a monster so defiled, And a horrible mouth, of such extent, From flapping ear to ear it went, And show'd such tusks whenever it smiled— The very mouth to devour a child! But fair or foul the jest gives birth To another bellow of demon mirth, That far outroars the weather, As if all the Hyænas that prowl the earth Had clubb'd their laughs together! And lo! in the middle of all the din, Not seeming to care a single pin For a prospect so volcanic, A Stranger steps abruptly in, Of an aspect rather Satanic: And he looks with a grin, at those Cyclops grim, Who stare and grin again at him With wondrous little panic. Then up to the Furnace the Stranger goes, Eager to thaw his ears and nose, And warm his frozen fingers and toes— While each succeeding minute, Hotter and hotter the Smithy grows, And seems to declare, By a fiercer glare, On wall, roof, floor, and everywhere, It knows the Devil is in it! Still not a word Is utter'd or heard, But the beetle-brow'd Foreman nods and winks Much as a shaggy old Lion blinks, And makes a shift To impart his drift To a smoky brother, who joining the links, Hints to a third the thing he thinks; And whatever it be, They all agree In smiling with faces full of glee, As if about to enjoy High Jinks. What sort of tricks they mean to play By way of diversion, who can say, Of such ferocious and barbarous folk, Who chuckled, indeed, and never spoke Of burning Robert the Jäger to coke, Except as a capital practical joke! Who never thought of Mercy, or heard her, Or any gentle emotion felt; But hard as the iron they had to melt, Sported with Danger and romp'd with Murder! Meanwhile the Stranger— The Brocken Ranger, Besides another and hotter post, That renders him not averse to a roast,— Creeping into the Furnace almost, Has made himself as warm as a toast— When, unsuspicious of any danger, And least of all of any such maggot, As treating his body like a faggot, All at once he is seized and shoven In pastime cruel, Like so much fuel, Headlong into the blazing oven! In he goes! with a frightful shout Mock'd by the rugged ruffianly band, As round the Furnace mouth they stand, Bar, and shovel, and ladle in hand, To hinder their Butt from crawling out, Who making one fierce attempt, but vain, Receives such a blow From Red-Beard's crow As crashes the skull and gashes the brain, And blind, and dizzy, and stunn'd with pain, With merely an interjectional “oh!” Back he rolls in the flames again. “Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!” That second fall Seems the very best joke of all, To judge by the roar Twice as loud as before, That fills the Hut, from the roof to the floor, And flies a league or two out of the door, Up the mountain and over the moor— But scarcely the jolly echoes they wake Have well begun To take up the fun, Ere the shaggy Felons have cause to quake, And begin to feel that the deed they have done, Instead of being a pleasant one, Was a very great error—and no mistake. For why?—in lieu Of its former hue, So natural, warm, and florid, The Furnace burns of a brimstone blue, And instead of the couleur de rose it threw, With a cooler reflection,—justly due— Exhibits each of the Pagan crew, Livid, ghastly, and horrid! But vainly they close their guilty eyes Against prophetic fears; Or with hard and horny palms devise To dam their enormous ears— There are sounds in the air, Not here or there, Irresistible voices everywhere, No bulwarks can ever rebut, And to match the screams, Tremendous gleams, Of Horrors that like the Phantoms of dreams They see with their eyelids shut! For awful coveys of terrible things, With forked tongues and venomous stings, On hagweed, broomsticks, and leathern wings, Are hovering round the Hut! Shapes, that within the focus bright Of the Forge, are like shadows and blots; But farther off, in the shades of night, Clothed with their own phosphoric light, Are seen in the darkest spots. Sounds! that fill the air with noises, Strange and indescribable voices, From Hags, in a diabolical clatter— Cats that spit curses, and apes that chatter Scraps of cabalistical matter— Owls that screech, and dogs that yell— Skeleton hounds that will never be fatter— All the domestic tribes of Hell, Shrieking for flesh to tear and tatter, Bones to shatter, And limbs to scatter, And who it is that must furnish the latter Those blue-looking Men know well! Those blue-looking men that huddle together, For all their sturdy limbs and thews, Their unshorn locks, like Nazarene Jews, And buffalo beards, and hides of leather, Huddled all in a heap together, Like timid lamb, and ewe, and wether, And as females say, In a similar way, Fit for knocking down with a feather! In and out, in and out, The gathering Goblins hover about, Ev'ry minute augmenting the rout; For like a spell The unearthly smell That fumes from the Furnace, chimney and mouth, Draws them in—an infernal Legion— From East, and West, and North, and South, Like carrion birds from ev'ry region, Till not a yard square Of the sickening air But has a Demon or two for its share, Breathing fury, woe, and despair, Never, never was such a sight! It beats the very Walpurgis Night, Displayed in the story of Doctor Faustus, For the scene to describe Of the awful tribe, If we were two Göthe's, would quite exhaust us Suffice it, amid that dreary swarm, There musters each foul repulsive form That ever a fancy overwarm Begot in its worst delirium; Besides some others of monstrous size, Never before revealed to eyes, Of the genus Megatherium! Meanwhile the demons, filthy and foul, Gorgon, Chimera, Harpy, and Ghoul, Are not contented to jibber and howl As a dirge for their late commander; But one of the bevy—witch or wizard, Disguised as a monstrous flying lizard, Springs on the grisly Salamander, Who stoutly fights, and struggles, and kicks, And tries the best of his wrestling tricks, No paltry strife, But for life, dear life, But the ruthless talons refuse to unfix, Till far beyond a surgical case, With starting eyes, and black in the face, Down he tumbles as dead as bricks! A pretty sight for his mates to view! Those shaggy murderers looking so blue, And for him above all, Red-bearded and tall, With whom, at that very particular nick, There is such an unlucky crow to pick, As the one of iron that did the trick In a recent bloody affair— No wonder feeling a little sick, With pulses beating uncommonly quick, And breath he never found so thick, He longs for the open air! Three paces, or four, And he gains the door; But ere he accomplishes one, The sound of a blow comes, heavy and dull. And clasping his fingers round his skull— However the deed was done, That gave him that florid Red gash on the forehead— With a roll of the eyeballs perfectly horrid, There's a tremulous quiver, The last death-shiver, And Red-Beard's course is run! Halloo! Halloo! They have done for two! But a heavyish job remains to do! For yonder, sledge and shovel in hand, Like elder Sons of Giant Despair, A couple of Cyclops make a stand, And fiercely hammering here and there, Keep at bay the Powers of Air— But desperation is all in vain!— They faint—they choke, For the sulphurous smoke Is poisoning heart, and lung, and brain, They reel, they sink, they gasp, they smother, One for a moment survives his brother, Then rolls a corpse across the other! Hulloo! Hulloo! And Hullabaloo! There is only one more thing to do— And seized by beak, and talon, and claw, Bony hand, and hairy paw, Yea, crooked horn, and tusky jaw, The four huge Bodies are haul'd and shoven Each after each in the roaring oven! That Eisen Hutte is standing still, Go to the Hartz whenever you will, And there it is beside a hill, And a rapid stream that turns many a mill; The self-same Forge,—you'll know it at sight— Casting upward, day and night, Flames of red, and yellow, and white! Ay, half a mile from the mountain gorge, There it is, the famous Forge, With its Furnace,—the same that blazed of yore,— Hugely fed with fuel and ore; But ever since that tremendous Revel, Whatever Iron is melted therein,— As Travellers know who have been to Berlin— Is all as black as the Devil! A CUSTOM-HOUSE BREEZE. One day—no matter for the month or year, A Calais packet, just come over, And safely moor'd within the pier, Began to land her passengers at Dover; All glad to end a voyage long and rough, And during which, Through roll and pitch, The Ocean-King had sickophants enough! Away, as fast as they could walk or run, Eager for steady rooms and quiet meals, With bundles, bags, and boxes at their heels, Away the passengers all went but one, A female, who from some mysterious check, Still linger'd on the steamer's deck, As if she did not care for land a tittle, For horizontal rooms, and cleanly victual— Or nervously afraid to put Her foot Into an Isle described as “tight and little.” In vain commissioner and touter, Porter and waiter throng'd about her; Boring, as such officials only bore— In spite of rope and barrow, knot and truck, Of plank and ladder, there she stuck, She couldn't, no, she wouldn't go on shore. “But, ma'am,” the steward interfered, “The wessel must be cleared. You mustn't stay aboard, ma'am, no one don't! It's quite agin the orders so to do— And all the passengers is gone but you.” Says she, “I cannot go ashore and won't!” “You ought to!” “But I can't!” “You must!” “I shan't!” At last, attracted by the racket, 'Twixt gown and jacket, The captain came himself, and cap in hand, Begg'd very civilly to understand Wherefore the lady could not leave the packet. “Why then,” the lady whispered with a shiver, That made the accents quiver, “I've got some foreign silks about me pinn'd, In short so many things, all contraband, To tell the truth I am afraid to land, In such a searching wind!” LAYING DOWN THE LAW. ? “I am Sir Oracle, And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.” Merchant of Venice. “If thou wert born a Dog, remain so; but if thou wert born a Man, resume thy former shape.” —Arabian Nights. A poodle, Judge-like, with emphatic paw, Dogmatically laying down the law,— A batch of canine Counsel round the table, Keen-eyed, and sharp of nose, and long of jaw, At sight, at scent, at giving tongue, right able: O, Edwin Landseer, Esquire, and R. A., Thou great Pictorial Æsop, say, What is the moral of this painted fable? O, say, accomplished artist! Was it thy purpose, by a scene so quizzical, To read a wholesome lesson to the Chartist, So over partial to the means called Physical, Sticks, staves, and swords, and guns, the tools of treason? To show, illustrating the better course, The very Brutes abandoning Brute Force, The worry and the fight, The bark and bite, In which, says Doctor Watts, the dogs delight, And lending shaggy ears to Law and Reason, As utter'd in that Court of high antiquity Where sits the Chancellor, supreme as Pope, But works—so let us hope— In equity, not iniquity? Or was it but a speculation On transmigration, How certain of our most distinguished Daniels, Interpreters of Law's bewildering book, Would look Transform'd to mastiffs, setters, hounds, and spaniels (As Brahmins in their Hindoo code advance), With that great lawyer of the Upper House Who rules all suits by equitable nous, Become—like vile Armina's spouse— A Dog, called Chance? Methinks, indeed, I recognise In those deep-set and meditative eyes Engaged in mental puzzle, And that portentous muzzle, A celebrated judge, too prone to tarry To hesitate on devious ins and outs, And, on preceding doubts, to build re-doubts That regiments could not carry— Prolonging even Law's delays, and still Putting a skid upon the wheel up-hill, Meanwhile the weary and desponding client Seem'd—in the agonies of indecision— In Doubting Castle, with that dreadful Giant Described in Bunyan's Vision! So slow, indeed, was justice in its ways, Beset by more than customary clogs, Going to law in those expensive days Was much the same as going to the Dogs! But possibly I err, And that sagacious and judicial Creature, So Chancellor-like in feature, With ears so wig-like, and a cap of fur, Looking as grave, responsible, and sage, As if he had the guardianship, in fact, Of all poor dogs, or crackt, And puppies under age— It may be that the Creature was not meant Any especial Lord to represent, Eldon or Erskine, Cottenham or Thurlow, Or Brougham (more like him whose potent jaw Is holding forth the letter of the law), Or Lyndhurst, after the vacation's furlough, Presently sitting in the House of Peers, On wool he sometimes wishes in his ears, When touching Corn Laws, Taxes, or Tithe-piggery, He hears a fierce attack, And, sitting on his sack, Listens in his great wig to greater Whiggery! So, possibly, those others, In coats so various, or sleek, or rough, Aim not at any of the legal brothers, Who wear the silken robe, or gown of stuff. Yet who that ever heard or saw The Counsel sitting in that solemn Court, Who, having pass'd the Bar, are safe in port, Or those great Sergeants, learned in the Law,— Who but must trace a feature now and then Of those forensic men, As good at finding heirs as any harrier, Renown'd like greyhounds for long tales—indeed, At worrying the ear as apt as terriers,— Good at conveyance as the hairy carriers That bear our gloves, umbrellas, hats, and sticks, Books, baskets, bones, or bricks, In Deeds of Trust as sure as Tray the trusty,— Acute at sniffing flaws on legal grounds,— And lastly—well the catalogue it closes!— Still following their predecessors' noses, Through ways however dull or dusty, As fond of hunting precedents, as hounds Of running after foxes more than musty. However slow or fast, Full of urbanity, or supercilious, In temper wild, serene, or atrabilious, Fluent of tongue, or prone to legal saw, The Dogs have got a Chancellor, at last, For Laying down the Law! And never may the canine race regret it, With whinings and repinings loud or deep,— Ragged in coat, and shorten'd in their keep, Worried by day, and troubled in their sleep, With cares that prey upon the heart and fret it— As human suitors have had cause to weep— For what is Law, unless poor Dogs can get it Dog-cheap? ETCHING MORALISED. TO A NOBLE LADY. “To point a moral.” —Johnson. Fairest Lady and Noble, for once on a time, Condescend to accept, in the humblest of rhyme, And a style more of Gay than of Milton, A few opportune verses design'd to impart Some didactical hints in a Needlework Art, Not described by the Countess of Wilton. An Art not unknown to the delicate hand Of the fairest and first in this insular land, But in Patronage Royal delighting; And which now your own feminine fantasy wins, Tho' it scarce seems a lady-like work, that begins In a scratching and ends in a biting! Yet oh! that the dames of the Scandalous School Would but use the same acid, and sharp-pointed tool, That are plied in the said operations— Oh! would that our Candours on copper would sketch! For the first of all things in beginning to etch Are—good grounds for our representations. Those protective and delicate coatings of wax, Which are meant to resist the corrosive attacks That would ruin the copper completely; Thin cerements which whoso remembers the Bee So applauded by Watts, the divine LL.D., Will be careful to spread very neatly. For why? like some intricate deed of the law, Should the ground in the process be left with a flaw, Aqua-fortis is far from a joker; And attacking the part that no coating protects, Will turn out as distressing to all your effects As a landlord who puts in a broker. Then carefully spread the conservative stuff, Until all the bright metal is cover'd enough, To repel a destructive so active; For in Etching, as well as in Morals, pray note That a little raw spot, or a hole in a coat, Your ascetics find vastly attractive. Thus the ground being laid, very even and flat, And then smoked with a taper, till black as a hat, Still from future disasters to screen it, Just allow me, by way of precaution, to state, You must hinder the footman from changing your plate, Nor yet suffer the butler to clean it. Nay, the housemaid, perchance, in her passion to scrub, May suppose the dull metal in want of a rub, Like the Shield which Swift's readers remember— Not to mention the chance of some other mishaps, Such as having your copper made up into caps To be worn on the First of September. But aloof from all damage by Betty or John, You secure the veil'd surface, and trace thereupon The design you conceive the most proper: Yet gently, and not with a needle too keen, Lest it pierce to the wax through the paper between, And of course play Old Scratch with the copper. So in worldly affairs, the sharp-practising man Is not always the one who succeeds in his plan, Witness Shylock's judicial exposure; Who, as keen as his knife, yet with agony found, That while urging his point he was losing his ground, And incurring a fatal disclosure. But, perhaps, without tracing at all, you may choose To indulge in some little extempore views, Like the older artistical people; For example, a Corydon playing his pipe, In a Low Country marsh, with a Cow after Cuyp, And a Goat skipping over a steeple. A wild Deer at a rivulet taking a sup, With a couple of Pillars put in to fill up, Like the columns of certain diurnals; Or a very brisk sea, in a very stiff gale, And a very Dutch boat, with a very big sail— Or a bevy of Retzsch's Infernals. Architectural study—or rich Arabesque— Allegorical dream—or a view picturesque, Near to Naples, or Venice, or Florence; Or “as harmless as lambs and as gentle as doves,” A sweet family cluster of plump little Loves, Like the Children by Reynolds or Lawrence. But whatever the subject, your exquisite taste Will ensure a design very charming and chaste, Like yourself, full of nature and beauty— Yet besides the good points you already reveal, You will need a few others—of well-temper'd steel, And especially form'd for the duty. For suppose that the tool be imperfectly set, Over many weak lengths in your line you will fret, Like a pupil of Walton and Cotton, Who remains by the brink of the water, agape, While the jack, trout, or barbel effects its escape Thro' the gut or silk line being rotten. Therefore, let the steel point be set truly and round, That the finest of strokes may be even and sound, Flowing glibly where fancy would lead 'em. But alas! for the needle that fetters the hand, And forbids even sketches of Liberty's land To be drawn with the requisite freedom! Oh! the botches I've seen by a tool of the sort, Rather hitching than etching, and making, in short, Such stiff, crabbed, and angular scratches, That the figures seem'd statues or mummies from tombs, While the trees were as rigid as bundles of brooms, And the herbage like bunches of matches! The stiff clouds as if carefully iron'd and starch'd, While a cast-iron bridge, meant for wooden, o'er-arch'd Something more like a road than a river. Prythee, who in such characteristics could see Any trace of the beautiful land of the free— The Free-Mason—Free-Trader—Free-Liver! But prepared by a hand that is skilful and nice, The fine point glides along like a skate on the ice, At the will of the Gentle Designer, Who impelling the needle just presses so much, That each line of her labour the copper may touch, As if done by a penny-a-liner. And behold! how the fast-growing images gleam! Like the sparkles of gold in a sunshiny stream, Till perplex'd by the glittering issue, You repine for a light of a tenderer kind— And in choosing a substance for making a blind, Do not sneeze at the paper call'd tissue. For, subdued by the sheet so transparent and white, Your design will appear in a soberer light, And reveal its defects on inspection, Just as Glory achieved, or political scheme, And some more of our dazzling performances seem, Not so bright on a cooler reflection. So the juvenile Poet with ecstasy views His first verses, and dreams that the songs of his Muse Are as brilliant as Moore's and as tender— Till some critical sheet scans the faulty design, And alas! takes the shine out of every line That had form'd such a vision of splendour; Certain objects, however, may come in your sketch, Which, design'd by a hand unaccustom'd to etch, With a luckless result may be branded; Wherefore add this particular rule to your code, Let all vehicles take the wrong side of the road, And man, woman, and child, be left-handed. Yet regard not the awkward appearance with doubt, But remember how often mere blessings fall out, That at first seem'd no better than curses; So, till things take a turn, live in hope, and depend That whatever is wrong will come right in the end, And console you for all your reverses. But of errors why speak, when for beauty and truth Your free, spirited Etching is worthy, in sooth, Of that Club (may all honour betide it!) Which, tho' dealing in copper, by genius and taste, Has accomplish'd a service of plate not disgraced By the work of a Goldsmith beside it! So your sketch superficially drawn on the plate, It becomes you to fix in a permanent state, Which involves a precise operation, With a keen biting fluid, which eating its way— As in other professions is common they say— Has attain'd an artistical station. And it's, oh! that some splenetic folks I could name If they must deal in acids would use but the same, In such innocent graphical labours! In the place of the virulent spirit wherewith— Like the polecat, the weasel, and things of that kith— They keep biting the backs of their neighbours! But beforehand, with wax or the shoemaker's pitch, You must build a neat dyke round the margin, in which You may pour the dilute aquafortis. For if raw like a dram, it will shock you to trace Your design with a horrible froth on its face, Like a wretch in articulo mortis. Like a wretch in the pangs that too many endure From the use of strong waters, without any pure, A vile practice, most sad and improper! For, from painful examples, this warning is found, That the raw burning spirit will take up the ground, In the churchyard, as well as on copper! But the Acid has duly been lower'd, and bites Only just where the visible metal invites, Like a nature inclined to meet troubles; And behold! as each slender and glittering line Effervesces, you trace the completed design In an elegant bead-work of bubbles! And yet constantly secretly eating its way, The shrewd acid is making the substance its prey, Like some sorrow beyond inquisition, Which is gnawing the heart and the brain all the while That the face is illumed by its cheerfullest smile, And the wit is in bright ebullition. But still stealthily feeding, the treacherous stuff Has corroded and deepen'd some portions enough— The pure sky, and the water so placid— And these tenderer tints to defend from attack, With some turpentine varnish and sooty lamp-black You must stop out the ferreting acid. But before with the varnishing brush you proceed, Let the plate with cold water be thoroughly freed From the other less innocent liquor— After which, on whatever you want to protect, Put a coat that will act to that very effect, Like the black one which hangs on the Vicar. Then—the varnish well dried—urge the biting again, But how long at its meal the eau forte may remain, Time and practice alone can determine: But of course not so long that the Mountain, and Mill, The rude Bridge, and the Figures, whatever you will, Are as black as the spots on your ermine. It is true, none the less, that a dark-looking scrap, With a sort of Blackheath, and Black Forest, mayhap, Is consider'd as rather Rembrandty; And that very black cattle and very black sheep, A black dog, and a shepherd as black as a sweep, Are the pets of some great Dilettante. So with certain designers, one needs not to name, All this life is a dark scene of sorrow and shame, From our birth to our final adjourning— Yea, this excellent earth and its glories, alack! What with ravens, palls, cottons, and devils, as black As a Warehouse for Family Mourning! But before your own picture arrives at that pitch, While the lights are still light, and the shadows, though rich, More transparent than ebony shutters, Never minding what Black-Arted critics may say, Stop the biting, and pour the green fluid away, As you please, into bottles or gutters. Then removing the ground and the wax at a heat, Cleanse the surface with oil, spermaceti or sweet, For your hand a performance scarce proper— So some careful professional person secure— For the Laundress will not be a safe amateur— To assist you in cleaning the copper. And, in truth, 'tis rather an unpleasantish job, To be done on a hot German stove, or a hob— Though as sure of an instant forgetting, When—as after the dark clearing-off of a storm— The fair Landscape shines out in a lustre as warm As the glow of the sun in its setting! Thus your Etching complete, it remains but to hint, That with certain assistance from paper and print, Which the proper Mechanic will settle, You may charm all your Friends—without any sad tale Of such perils and ills as beset Lady Sale— With a fine India Proof of your Metal. SONNET. [My heart is sick with longing, tho' I feed] My heart is sick with longing, tho' I feed On hope; Time goes with such a heavy pace That neither brings nor takes from thy embrace, As if he slept—forgetting his old speed: For, as in sunshine only we can read The march of minutes on the dial's face, So in the shadows of this lonely place There is no love, and Time is dead indeed. But when, dear lady, I am near thy heart, Thy smile is time, and then so swift it flies, It seems we only meet to tear apart, With aching hands and lingering of eyes. Alas, alas! that we must learn hours' flight By the same light of love that makes them bright! A BLACK JOB. “No doubt the pleasure is as great, Of being cheated as to cheat.” —Hudibras. The history of human-kind to trace, Since Eve—the first of dupes—our doom unriddled, A certain portion of the human race Has certainly a taste for being diddled. Witness the famous Mississippi dreams! A rage that time seems only to redouble— The Banks, Joint-Stocks, and all the flimsy schemes, For rolling in Pactolian streams, That cost our modern rogues so little trouble. No matter what,—to pasture cows on stubble, To twist sea-sand into a solid rope, To make French bricks and fancy bread of rubble, Or light with gas the whole celestial cope— Only propose to blow a bubble, And Lord! what hundreds will subscribe for soap! Soap!—it reminds me of a little tale, Tho' not a pig's, the hawbuck's glory, When rustic games and merriment prevail— But here's my story: Once on a time—no matter when— A knot of very charitable men Set up a Philantrophical Society, Professing on a certain plan, To benefit the race of man, And in particular that dark variety, Which some suppose inferior—as in vermin, The sable is to ermine, As smut to flour, as coal to alabaster, As crows to swans, as soot to driven snow, As blacking, or as ink to “milk below,” Or yet a better simile, to show, As ragman's dolls to images in plaster! However, as is usual in our city, They had a sort of managing Committee, A board of grave responsible Directors— A Secretary, good at pen and ink— A Treasurer, of course, to keep the chink, And quite an army of Collectors! Not merely male, but female duns, Young, old, and middle-aged—of all degrees— With many of those persevering ones, Who mite by mite would beg a cheese! And what might be their aim? To rescue Afric's sable sons from fetters— To save their bodies from the burning shame Of branding with hot letters— Their shoulders from the cowhide's bloody strokes, Their necks from iron yokes? To end or mitigate the ills of slavery, The Planter's avarice, the Driver's knavery? To school the heathen Negroes and enlighten 'em, To polish up and brighten 'em, And make them worthy of eternal bliss? Why, no—the simple end and aim was this— Reading a well-known proverb much amiss— To wash and whiten 'em! They look'd so ugly in their sable hides: So dark, so dingy, like a grubby lot Of sooty sweeps, or colliers, and besides, However the poor elves Might wash themselves, Nobody knew if they were clean or not— On Nature's fairness they were quite a blot! Not to forget more serious complaints That even while they join'd in pious hymn, So black they were and grim, In face and limb, They look'd like Devils, tho' they sang like Saints! The thing was undeniable! They wanted washing! not that slight ablution To which the skin of the White Man is liable, Merely removing transient pollution— But good, hard, honest, energetic rubbing And scrubbing, Sousing each sooty frame from heels to head With stiff, strong, saponaceous lather, And pails of water—hottish rather, But not so boiling as to turn 'em red! So spoke the philanthropic man Who laid, and hatch'd, and nursed the plan— And oh! to view its glorious consummation! The brooms and mops, The tubs and slops, The baths and brushes in full operation! To see each Crow, or Jim, or John, Go in a raven and come out a swan! While fair as Cavendishes, Vanes, and Russels, Black Venus rises from the soapy surge, And all the little Niggerlings emerge As lily-white as mussels. Sweet was the vision—but alas! However in prospectus bright and sunny, To bring such visionary scenes to pass One thing was requisite, and that was—money! Money, that pays the laundress and her bills, For socks and collars, shirts and frills, Cravats and kerchiefs—money, without which The negroes must remain as dark as pitch; A thing to make all Christians sad and shivery, To think of millions of immortal souls Dwelling in bodies black as coals, And living—so to speak—in Satan's livery! Money—the root of evil,—dross, and stuff! But oh! how happy ought the rich to feel, Whose means enable them to give enough To blanch an African from head to heel! How blessed—yea, thrice blessed—to subscribe Enough to scour a tribe! While he whose fortune was at best a brittle one, Although he gave but pence, how sweet to know He helped to bleach a Hottentot's great toe, Or little one! Moved by this logic (or appall'd) To persons of a certain turn so proper, The money came when call'd, In silver, gold, and copper, Presents from “Friends to blacks,” or foes to whites, “Trifles,” and “offerings,” and “widow's mites,” Plump legacies, and yearly benefactions, With other gifts And charitable lifts, Printed in lists and quarterly transactions. As thus—Elisha Brettel, An iron kettle. The Dowager Lady Scannel, A piece of flannel. Rebecca Pope, A bar of soap. The Misses Howels, Half-a-dozen towels. The Master Rush's, Two scrubbing-brushes. Mr. T. Groom, A stable broom, And Mrs. Grubb, A tub. Great were the sums collected! And great results in consequence expected. But somehow, in the teeth of all endeavour, According to reports At yearly courts, The blacks, confound them! were as black as ever! Yes! spite of all the water sous'd aloft, Soap, plain and mottled, hard and soft, Soda and pearlash, huckaback and sand, Brooms, brushes, palm of hand, And scourers in the office strong and clever, In spite of all the tubbing, rubbing, scrubbing, The routing and the grubbing, The blacks, confound them! were as black as ever! In fact in his perennial speech, The Chairman own'd the niggers did not bleach, As he had hoped, From being washed and soaped, A circumstance he named with grief and pity; But still he had the happiness to say, For self and the Committee, By persevering in the present way And scrubbing at the Blacks from day to day, Although he could not promise perfect white, From certain symptoms that had come to light, He hoped in time to get them gray! Lull'd by this vague assurance, The friends and patrons of the sable tribe Continued to subscribe, And waited, waited on with much endurance— Many a frugal sister, thrifty daughter— Many a stinted widow, pinching mother— With income by the tax made somewhat shorter, Still paid implicitly her crown per quarter, Only to hear as ev'ry year came round, That Mr. Treasurer had spent her pound; And as she loved her sable brother, That Mr. Treasurer must have another! But, spite of pounds or guineas, Instead of giving any hint Of turning to a neutral tint, The plaguy negroes and their piccaninnies Were still the colour of the bird that caws— Only some very aged souls Showing a little gray upon their polls, Like daws! However, nothing dashed By such repeated failures, or abashed, The Court still met;—the Chairman and Directors, The Secretary, good at pen and ink, The worthy Treasurer, who kept the chink, And all the cash Collectors; With hundreds of that class, so kindly credulous, Without whose help, no charlatan alive, Or Bubble Company could hope to thrive, Or busy Chevalier, however sedulous— Those good and easy innocents in fact, Who willingly receiving chaff for corn, As pointed out by Butler's tact, Still find a secret pleasure in the act Of being pluck'd and shorn! However, in long hundreds there they were, Thronging the hot, and close, and dusty court, To hear once more addresses from the Chair, And regular Report. Alas! concluding in the usual strain, That what with everlasting wear and tear, The scrubbing-brushes hadn't got a hair— The brooms—mere stumps—would never serve again— The soap was gone, the flannels all in shreds, The towels worn to threads, The tubs and pails too shatter'd to be mended— And what was added with a deal of pain, But as accounts correctly would explain, Tho' thirty thousand pounds had been expended— The Blackamoors had still been wash'd in vain! “In fact, the negroes were as black as ink, Yet, still as the Committee dared to think, And hoped the proposition was not rash, A rather free expenditure of cash—” But ere the prospect could be made more sunny— Up jump'd a little, lemon-coloured man, And with an eager stammer, thus began, In angry earnest, though it sounded funny: “What! More subscriptions! No—no—no,—not I! You have had time—time—time enough to try! They won't come white! then why—why—why—why—why, More money?” “Why!” said the Chairman, with an accent bland, And gentle waving of his dexter hand, “Why must we have more dross, and dirt, and dust, More filthy lucre, in a word, more gold— The why, sir, very easily is told, Because Humanity declares we must! We've scrubb'd the negroes till we've nearly killed 'em, And finding that we cannot wash them white, But still their nigritude offends the sight, We mean to gild 'em!” ADDRESS. Hush! not a sound! no whisper! no demur! No restless motion—no intrusive stir! But with staid presence and a quiet breath, One solemn moment dedicate to Death! [A pause. For now no fancied miseries bespeak The panting bosom, and the wetted cheek; No fabled Tempest, or dramatic wreck, No Royal Sire wash'd from the mimic deck, And dirged by Sea Nymphs to his briny grave! Alas! deep, deep beneath the sullen wave, His heart, once warm and throbbing as your own, Now cold and senseless as the shingle stone; His lips, so eloquent, choked up with sand; The bright eye glazed,—and the impressive hand, Idly entangled with the ocean weed— Full fathom five, a Father lies indeed! Yes! where the foaming billows rave the while Around the rocky Ferns and Holy Isle, Deaf to their roar, as to the dear applause That greets deserving in the Drama's cause, Blind to the horrors that appal the bold, To all he hoped, or feared, or loved, of old— To love—and love's deep agony, a-cold; He, who could move the passions, moved by none, Drifts an unconscious corse.—Poor Elton's race is run! Weep for the dead! Yet do not merely weep For him who slumbers in the oozy deep: Mourn for the dead!—yet not alone for him O'er whom the cormorant and gannet swim; But, like Grace Darling in her little boat, Stretch out a saving hand to those that float— The orphan Seven—so prematurely hurl'd Upon the billows of this stormy world, And struggling—save your pity take their part— With breakers huge enough to break the heart! YOUTH AND AGE. Impatient of his childhood, “Ah me!” exclaims young Arthur, Whilst roving in the wild wood, “I wish I were my father!” Meanwhile, to see his Arthur So skip, and play, and run, “Ah me!” exclaims the father, “I wish I were my son!” TO HENRIETTA, ON HER DEPARTURE FOR CALAIS. When little people go abroad, wherever they may roam, They will not just be treated as they used to be at home; So take a few promiscuous hints, to warn you in advance, Of how a little English girl will perhaps be served in France. Of course you will be Frenchified; and first, it's my belief, They'll dress you in their foreign style as à-la-mode as beef, With a little row of beehives, as a border to your frock, And a pair of frilly trousers, like a little bantam cock. But first they'll seize your bundle (if you have one) in a crack, And tie it with a tape by way of bustle on your back; And make your waist so high or low, your shape will be a riddle, For anyhow you'll never have your middle in the middle. Your little English sandals for a while will hold together, But woe betide you when the stones have worn away the leather; For they'll poke your little pettitoes (and there will be a hobble!) In such a pair of shoes as none but carpenters can cobble! What next?—to fill your head with French to match the native girls In scraps of Galignani they'll screw up your little curls; And they'll take their nouns and verbs, and some bits of verse and prose, And pour them in your ears that you may spout them through your nose. You'll have to learn a chou is quite another sort of thing To that you put your foot in; that a belle is not to ring; That a corne is not the nubble that brings trouble to your toes; Nor peut-être a potato, as some Irish folks suppose. No, no, they have no murphies there, for supper or for lunch, But you may get in course of time a pomme de terre to munch, With which, as you perforce must do as Calais folks are doing, You'll maybe have to gobble up the frog that went a wooing! But pray at meals, remember this, the French are so polite, No matter what you eat or drink, “whatever is, is right!” So when you're told at dinner-time that some delicious stew Is cat instead of rabbit, you must answer “Tant mi—eux!” For little folks who go abroad, wherever they may roam, They cannot just be treated as they used to be at home; So take a few promiscuous hints, to warn you in advance, Of how a little English girl will perhaps be served in France! A DROP OF GIN. Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin! What magnified monsters circle therein! Ragged, and stained with filth and mud, Some plague spotted, and some with blood! Shapes of misery, shame, and sin! Figures that make us loathe and tremble, Creatures scarce human that more resemble Broods of diabolical kin, Ghost and vampyre, demon and Jin! Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin! The dram of Satan! the liquor of Sin!— Distilled from the fell Alembics of hell, By Guilt, and Death,—his own brother and twin!— That man might fall Still lower than all The meanest creatures with scale and fin. But, hold;—we are neither Barebones nor Prynne, Who lashed with such rage The sins of the age; Then, instead of making too much of a din, Let Anger be mute, And sweet Mercy dilute, With a drop of pity, the drop of Gin! Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin! When, darkly, Adversity's days set in, And the friends and peers Of earlier years Prove warm without, but cold within, And cannot retrace A familiar face That's steeped in poverty up to the chin; But snub, neglect, cold-shoulder, and cut The ragged pauper, misfortune's butt; Hardly acknowledged by kith and kin, Because, poor rat! He has no cravat, A seedy coat, and a hole in that!— No sole to his shoe, and no brim to his hat; Nor a change of linen—except his skin; No gloves, no vest, Either second or best; And, what is worse than all the rest, No light heart, though his trousers are thin— While time elopes With all golden hopes, And even with those of pewter and tin; The brightest dreams, And the best of schemes, All knocked down, like a wicket by Mynn. Each castle in air Seized by giant Despair, No prospect in life worth a minnikin pin; No credit, no cash, No cold mutton to hash, No bread—not even potatoes to mash; No coal in the cellar, no wine in the binn— Smashed, broken to bits, With judgments and writs, Bonds, bills, and cognovits distracting the wits, In the webs that the spiders of Chancery spin— Till, weary of life, its worry and strife, Black visions are rife of a razor, a knife; Of poison—a rope—“louping over a linn.” Gin! Gin! a drop of Gin! Oh! then its tremendous temptations begin, To take, alas! To the fatal glass;— And happy the wretch that does not win To change the black hue Of his ruin to “blue”— While angels sorrow, and demons grin— And lose the rheumatic Chill of his attic By plunging into the Palace of Gin! THE SONG OF THE SHIRT. With fingers weary and worn, With eyelids heavy and red, A woman sat, in unwomanly rags, Plying her needle and thread— Stitch! stitch! stitch! In poverty, hunger, and dirt, And still with a voice of dolorous pitch She sang the “Song of the Shirt.” “Work! work! work! While the cock is crowing aloof! And work—work—work, Till the stars shine through the roof! It's Oh! to be a slave Along with the barbarous Turk, Where woman has never a soul to save, If this is Christian work! “Work—work—work Till the brain begins to swim; Work—work—work Till the eyes are heavy and dim! Seam, and gusset, and band, Band, and gusset, and seam, Till over the buttons I fall asleep, And sew them on in a dream! “Oh, Men, with Sisters dear! Oh, Men, with Mothers and Wives! It is not linen you're wearing out, But human creatures' lives! Stitch—stitch—stitch, In poverty, hunger and dirt, Sewing at once, with a double thread, A Shroud as well as a Shirt. “But why do I talk of Death? That Phantom of grisly bone, I hardly fear his terrible shape, It seems so like my own— It seems so like my own, Because of the fasts I keep; Oh, God! that bread should be so dear, And flesh and blood so cheap! “Work—work—work! My labour never flags; And what are its wages? A bed of straw, A crust of bread—and rags. That shatter'd roof—and this naked floor— A table—a broken chair— And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank For sometimes falling there! “Work—work—work! From weary chime to chime, Work—work—work— As prisoners work for crime! Band, and gusset, and seam, Seam, and gusset, and band, Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumb'd, As well as the weary hand. “Work—work—work, In the dull December light, And work—work—work, When the weather is warm and bright— While underneath the eaves The brooding swallows cling As if to show me their sunny backs And twit me with the spring. “Oh! but to breathe the breath Of the cowslip and primrose sweet— With the sky above my head, And the grass beneath my feet, For only one short hour To feel as I used to feel, Before I knew the woes of want And the walk that costs a meal! “Oh! but for one short hour! A respite however brief! No blessed leisure for Love or Hope, But only time for Grief! A little weeping would ease my heart, But in their briny bed My tears must stop, for every drop Hinders needle and thread!” With fingers weary and worn, With eyelids heavy and red, A woman sat in unwomanly rags, Plying her needle and thread— Stitch! stitch! stitch! In poverty, hunger, and dirt, And still with a voice of dolorous pitch,— Would that its tone could reach the Rich!— She sang this “Song of the Shirt!” [The following verse appears in the original MS. of “The Song of the Shirt.”] Seam, and gusset, and band, Band, and gusset, and seam, Work, work, work, Like the Engine that works by Steam! A mere machine of iron and wood, That toils for Mammon's sake, Without a brain to ponder and craze, Or a heart to feel—and break! THE PAUPER'S CHRISTMAS CAROL. Full of drink and full of meat, On our Saviour's natal day, Charity's perennial treat; Thus I heard a Pauper say:— “Ought not I to dance and sing Thus supplied with famous cheer? Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year. “After labour's long turmoil, Sorry fare and frequent fast, Two-and-fifty weeks of toil, Pudding-time is come at last! But are raisins high or low, Flour and suet cheap or dear? Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year, “Fed upon the coarsest fare Three hundred days and sixty-four But for one on viands rare, Just as if I wasn't poor! Ought not I to bless my stars, Warden, clerk, and overseer? Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year. “Treated like a welcome guest, One of Nature's social chain, Seated, tended on, and press'd— But when shall I be press'd again, Twice to pudding, thrice to beef, A dozen times to ale and beer? Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year. “Come to-morrow how it will; Diet scant and usage rough, Hunger once has had its fill, Thirst for once has had enough, But shall I ever dine again? Or see another feast appear? Heigho! I only know— Christmas comes but once a year! “Frozen cares begin to melt, Hopes revive and spirits flow— Feeling as I have not felt Since a dozen months ago— Glad enough to sing a song— To-morrow shall I volunteer? Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year. “Bright and blessed is the time, Sorrows end and joys begin, While the bells with merry chime Ring the Day of Plenty in! But the happy tide to hail, With a sigh or with a tear, Heigho! I hardly know— Christmas comes but once a year!” 1844. THE HAUNTED HOUSE. A ROMANCE. “A jolly place, said he, in days of old, But something ails it now: the spot is curst.” Wordsworth. PART I. Some dreams we have are nothing else but dreams, Unnatural, and full of contradictions; Yet others of our most romantic schemes Are something more than fictions. It might be only on enchanted ground; It might be merely by a thought's expansion; But, in the spirit or the flesh, I found An old deserted Mansion. A residence for woman, child, and man, A dwelling place,—and yet no habitation; A House,—but under some prodigious ban Of Excommunication. Unhinged the iron gates half open hung, Jarr'd by the gusty gales of many winters, That from its crumbled pedestal had flung One marble globe in splinters. No dog was at the threshold, great or small; No pigeon on the roof—no household creature— No cat demurely dozing on the wall— Not one domestic feature. No human figure stirr'd, to go or come, No face look'd forth from shut or open casement; No chimney smoked—there was no sign of Home From parapet to basement. With shatter'd panes the grassy court was starr'd; The time-worn coping-stone had tumbled after; And thro' the ragged roof the sky shone, barr'd With naked beam and rafter. O'er all there hung a shadow and a fear; A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! The flow'r grew wild and rankly as the weed, Roses with thistles struggled for espial, And vagrant plants of parasitic breed Had overgrown the Dial. But gay or gloomy, steadfast or infirm, No heart was there to heed the hour's duration; All times and tides were lost in one long term Of stagnant desolation. The wren had built within the Porch, she found Its quiet loneliness so sure and thorough; And on the lawn,—within its turfy mound,— The rabbit made his burrow. The rabbit wild and gray, that flitted thro' The shrubby clumps, and frisk'd, and sat, and vanish'd, But leisurely and bold, as if he knew His enemy was banish'd. The wary crow,—the pheasant from the woods— Lull'd by the still and everlasting sameness, Close to the mansion, like domestic broods, Fed with a “shocking tameness.” The coot was swimming in the reedy pond, Beside the water-hen, so soon affrighted; And in the weedy moat the heron, fond Of solitude, alighted. The moping heron, motionless and stiff, That on a stone, as silently and stilly, Stood, an apparent sentinel, as if To guard the water-lily. No sound was heard except, from far away, The ringing of the witwall's shrilly laughter, Or, now and then, the chatter of the jay, That Echo murmur'd after. But Echo never mock'd the human tongue; Some weighty crime, that Heaven could not pardon, A secret curse on that old Building hung, And its deserted Garden. The beds were all untouch'd by hand or tool; No footstep marked the damp and mossy gravel, Each walk as green as is the mantled pool, For want of human travel. The vine unpruned, and the neglected peach, Droop'd from the wall with which they used to grapple; And on the canker'd tree, in easy reach, Rotted the golden apple. But awfully the truant shunn'd the ground, The vagrant kept aloof, and daring Poacher; In spite of gaps that thro' the fences round Invited the encroacher. For over all there hung a cloud of fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! The pear and quince lay squander'd on the grass; The mould was purple with unheeded showers Of bloomy plums—a Wilderness it was Of fruits, and weeds, and flowers! The marigold amidst the nettles blew, The gourd embraced the rose bush in its ramble, The thistle and the stock together grew, The holly-hock and bramble. The bear-bine with the lilac interlaced, The sturdy bur-dock choked its slender neighbour, The spicy pink. All tokens were effaced Of human care and labour. The very yew Formality had train'd To such a rigid pyramidal stature, For want of trimming had almost regain'd The raggedness of nature. The Fountain was a-dry—neglect and time Had marr'd the work of artisan and mason, And efts and croaking frogs, begot of slime, Sprawl'd in the ruin'd bason. The Statue, fallen from its marble base, Amidst the refuse leaves, and herbage rotten, Lay like the Idol of some by-gone race, Its name and rites forgotten. On ev'ry side the aspect was the same, All ruin'd, desolate, forlorn, and savage: No hand or foot within the precinct came To rectify or ravage. For over all there hung a cloud of fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! PART II. O, very gloomy is the House of Woe, Where tears are falling while the bell is knelling, With all the dark solemnities which show That Death is in the dwelling! O very, very dreary is the room Where Love, domestic Love, no longer nestles, But, smitten by the common stroke of doom, The Corpse lies on the trestles! But House of Woe, and hearse, and sable pall, The narrow home of the departed mortal, Ne'er look'd so gloomy as that Ghostly Hall, With its deserted portal! The centipede along the threshold crept, The cobweb hung across in mazy tangle, And in its winding-sheet the maggot slept, At every nook and angle. The keyhole lodged the earwig and her brood, The emmets of the steps had old possession, And march'd in search of their diurnal food In undisturb'd procession. As undisturb'd as the prehensile cell Of moth or maggot, or the spider's tissue, For never foot upon that threshold fell, To enter or to issue. O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! Howbeit, the door I push'd—or so I dream'd— Which slowly, slowly gaped,—the hinges creaking With such a rusty eloquence, it seem'd That Time himself was speaking. But Time was dumb within that Mansion old, Or left his tale to the heraldic banners, That hung from the corroded walls, and told Of former men and manners:— Those tatter'd flags, that with the open'd door, Seem'd the old wave of battle to remember, While fallen fragments danced upon the floor, Like dead leaves in December. The startled bats flew out,—bird after bird,— The screech-owl overhead began to flutter, And seem'd to mock the cry that she had heard Some dying victim utter! A shriek that echo'd from the joisted roof, And up the stair, and further still and further, Till in some ringing chamber far aloof It ceased its tale of murther! Meanwhile the rusty armour rattled round, The banner shudder'd, and the ragged streamer; All things the horrid tenor of the sound Acknowledged with a tremor. The antlers, where the helmet hung, and belt, Stirr'd as the tempest stirs the forest branches, Or as the stag had trembled when he felt The blood-hound at his haunches. The window jingled in its crumbled frame, And thro' its many gaps of destitution Dolorous moans and hollow sighings came, Like those of dissolution. The wood-louse dropped, and rolled into a ball, Touch'd by some impulse occult or mechanic; And nameless beetles ran along the wall In universal panic. The subtle spider, that from overhead Hung like a spy on human guilt and error, Suddenly turn'd, and up its slender thread Ran with a nimble terror. The very stains and fractures on the wall Assuming features solemn and terrific, Hinted some Tragedy of that old Hall, Lock'd up in hieroglyphic. Some tale that might, perchance, have solved the doubt, Wherefore amongst those flags so dull and livid, The banner of the Bloody Hand shone out So ominously vivid. Some key to that inscrutable appeal, Which made the very frame of Nature quiver; And ev'ry thrilling nerve and fibre feel So ague-like a shiver. For over all there hung a cloud of fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted; And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! If but a rat had linger'd in the house, To lure the thought into a social channel! But not a rat remain'd, or tiny mouse, To squeak behind the panel. Huge drops roll'd down the walls, as if they wept; And where the cricket used to chirp so shrilly, The toad was squatting, and the lizard crept On that damp hearth and chilly. For years no cheerful blaze had sparkled there, Or glanced on coat of buff or knightly metal; The slug was crawling on the vacant chair,— The snail upon the settle. The floor was redolent of mould and must, The fungus in the rotten seams had quicken'd; While on the oaken table coats of dust Perenially had thicken'd. No mark of leathern jack or metal can, No cup—no horn—no hospitable token,— All social ties between that board and Man Had long ago been broken. There was so foul a rumour in the air, The shadow of a Presence so atrocious; No human creature could have feasted there, Even the most ferocious. For over all there hung a cloud of fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! PART III. 'Tis hard for human actions to account, Whether from reason or from impulse only— But some internal prompting bade me mount The gloomy stairs and lonely. Those gloomy stairs, so dark, and damp, and cold, With odours as from bones and relics carnal, Deprived of rite, and consecrated mould, The chapel vault, or charnel. Those dreary stairs, where with the sounding stress Of ev'ry step so many echoes blended, The mind, with dark misgivings, fear'd to guess How many feet ascended. The tempest with its spoils had drifted in, Till each unwholesome stone was darkly spotted, As thickly as the leopard's dappled skin, With leaves that rankly rotted. The air was thick—and in the upper gloom The bat—or something in its shape—was winging; And on the wall, as chilly as a tomb, The Death's-Head moth was clinging. That mystic moth, which, with a sense profound Of all unholy presence, augurs truly; And with a grim significance flits round The taper burning bluely. Such omens in the place there seem'd to be, At ev'ry crooked turn, or on the landing, The straining eyeball was prepared to see Some Apparition standing. For over all there hung a cloud of fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! Yet no portentous Shape the sight amazed; Each object plain, and tangible, and valid; But from their tarnish'd frames dark Figures gazed, And Faces spectre-pallid. Not merely with the mimic life that lies Within the compass of Art's simulation; Their souls were looking thro' their painted eyes With awful speculation. On ev'ry lip a speechless horror dwelt; On ev'ry brow the burthen of affliction; The old Ancestral Spirits knew and felt The House's malediction. Such earnest woe their features overcast, They might have stirr'd, or sigh'd, or wept, or spoken; But, save the hollow moaning of the blast, The stillness was unbroken. No other sound or stir of life was there, Except my steps in solitary clamber, From flight to flight, from humid stair to stair, From chamber into chamber. Deserted rooms of luxury and state, That old magnificence had richly furnish'd With pictures, cabinets of ancient date, And carvings gilt and burnish'd. Rich hangings, storied by the needle's art With scripture history, or classic fable; But all had faded, save one ragged part, Where Cain was slaying Abel. The silent waste of mildew and the moth Had marr'd the tissue with a partial ravage; But undecaying frown'd upon the cloth Each feature stern and savage. The sky was pale; the cloud a thing of doubt; Some hues were fresh, and some decay'd and duller; But still the BLOODY HAND shone strangely out With vehemence of colour! The BLOODY HAND that with a lurid stain Shone on the dusty floor, a dismal token, Projected from the casement's painted pane, Where all beside was broken. The BLOODY HAND significant of crime, That glaring on the old heraldic banner, Had kept its crimson unimpair'd by time, In such a wondrous manner! O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! The Death Watch tick'd behind the panel'd oak, Inexplicable tremors shook the arras, And echoes strange and mystical awoke, The fancy to embarrass. Prophetic hints that filled the soul with dread, But thro' one gloomy entrance pointing mostly, The while some secret inspiration said, That Chamber is the Ghostly! Across the door no gossamer festoon Swung pendulous—no web—no dusty fringes, No silky chrysalis or white cocoon About its nooks and hinges. The spider shunn'd the interdicted room, The moth, the beetle, and the fly were banish'd, And where the sunbeam fell athwart the gloom The very midge had vanish'd. One lonely ray that glanced upon a Bed, As if with awful aim direct and certain, To show the Bloody Hand in burning red Embroider'd on the curtain. And yet no gory stain was on the quilt— The pillow in its place had slowly rotted; The floor alone retain'd the trace of guilt, Those boards obscurely spotted. Obscurely spotted to the door, and thence With mazy doubles to the grated casement— Oh what a tale they told of fear intense, Of horror and amazement! What human creature in the dead of night Had coursed like hunted hare that cruel distance? Had sought the door, the window in his flight, Striving for dear existence? What shrieking Spirit in that bloody room Its mortal frame had violently quitted?— Across the sunbeam, with a sudden gloom, A ghostly Shadow flitted. Across the sunbeam, and along the wall, But painted on the air so very dimly, It hardly veil'd the tapestry at all, Or portrait frowning grimly. O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear, A sense of mystery the spirit daunted, And said, as plain as whisper in the ear, The place is Haunted! A TALE OF TEMPER. Of all cross breeds of human sinners, The crabbedest are those who dress our dinners; Whether the ardent fires at which they roast And broil and bake themselves like Smithfield martyrs, Are apt to make them crusty, like a toast, Or drams, encouraged by so hot a post; However, cooks are generally Tartars; And altogether might be safely cluster'd In scientific catalogues Under two names, like Dinmont's dogs, Pepper and Mustard. The case thus being very common, It followed, quite of course, when Mr. Jervis Engaged a clever culinary woman, He took a mere Xantippe in his service— In fact—her metal not to burnish, As vile a shrew as Shrewsbury could furnish— One who in temper, language, manners, looks, In every respect Might just have come direct From him, who is supposed to send us cooks. The very day she came into her place She slapp'd the scullion's face; The next, the housemaid being rather pert, Snatching the broom, she “treated her like dirt’— The third, a quarrel with the groom she hit on— Cyrus, the page, had half-a-dozen knocks; And John, the coachman, got a box He couldn't sit on. Meanwhile, her strength to rally, Brandy, and rum, and shrub she drank by stealth, Besides the Cream of some mysterious Valley That may, or may not, be the Vale of Health: At least while credit lasted, or her wealth— For finding that her blows came only thicker, Invectives and foul names but flew the quicker, The more she drank, the more inclined to bicker, The other servants, one and all, Took Bible oaths whatever might befal, Neither to lend her cash, nor fetch her liquor! This caused, of course, a dreadful schism, And what was worse, in spite of all endeavour, After a fortnight of Tea-totalism, The Plague broke out more virulent than ever! The life she led her fellows down the stairs! The life she led her betters in the parlour! No parrot ever gave herself such airs, No pug-dog cynical was such a snarler! At woman, man, and child, she flew and snapp'd, No rattlesnake on earth so fierce and rancorous— No household cat that ever lapp'd To swear and spit was half so apt— No bear, sore-headed, could be more cantankerous— No fretful porcupine more sharp and crabbed— No wolverine More full of spleen— In short, the woman was completely rabid! The least offence of look or phrase, The slightest verbal joke, the merest frolic, Like a snap-dragon set her in a blaze, Her spirit was so alcoholic! And woe to him who felt her tongue! It burnt like caustic—like a nettle stung, Her speech was scalding—scorching—vitriolic! And larded, not with bacon fat, Or anything so mild as that, But curses so intensely diabolic, So broiling hot, that he, at whom she levell'd, Felt in his very gizzard he was devill'd! Often and often Mr. Jervis Long'd, and yet feared, to turn her from his service; For why? Of all his philosophic loads Of reptiles loathsome, spiteful, and pernicious, Stuff'd Lizards, bottled Snakes, and pickled Toads, Potted Tarantulas, and Asps malicious, And Scorpions cured by scientific modes, He had not any creature half so vicious! At last one morning The coachman had already given warning, And little Cyrus Was gravely thinking of a new cockade, For open War's rough sanguinary trade, Or any other service, quite desirous, Instead of quarrelling with such a jade— When accident explain'd the coil she made, And whence her Temper had derived the virus! Struck with the fever, called the scarlet, The Termagant was lying sick in bed— And little Cyrus, that precocious varlet, Was just declaring her “as good as dead,” When down the attic stairs the housemaid, Charlotte, Came running from the chamber overhead, Like one demented; Flapping her hands, and casting up her eyes, And giving gasps of horror and surprise, Which thus she vented— “O Lord! I wonder that she didn't bite us! Or sting us like a Tantalizer, (The note will make the Reader wiser,) And set us all a dancing like St. Witus! “Temper! No wonder that the creatur had A temper so uncommon bad! She's just confess'd to Doctor Griper That being out of Rum, and like denials,— Which always was prodigious trials,— Because she couldn't pay the piper, She went one day, she did, to Master's wials, And drunk the spirit as preserved the Wiper!” A SONG FOR THE MILLION. ON WILHELM'S METHOD. There's a Music aloft in the air As if Cherubs were humming a song, Now it's high, now it's low, here and there, There's a Harmony floating along! While the steeples are loud in their joy, To the tune of the bells' ring-a-ding, Let us chime in a peal, one and all, For we all should be able to sing Hullahbaloo! We are Chartists, Destructives and rogues, We are Radicals, Tories, and Whigs, We are Churchmen, Dissenters, what not, We are asses, curs, monkeys and pigs, But in spite of the slanderous names Partisans on each other will fling. Tho' in concord we cannot agree, Yet we all in a chorus may sing Hullahbaloo! We may not have a happy New Year, Be perplex'd by all possible ills— Find the bread and the meat very dear, And be troubled with very hard bills— Yet like linnets, cock-robins and wrens, Larks, and nightingales joyous in Spring, Or the finches saluting their hens, Sure we all should be able to sing Hullahbaloo! We may have but a Lilliput purse, And the change in the purse very small, And our notes may not pass at the Bank, But they're current at Exeter Hall! Then a fig for foul weather and fogs! And whatever Misfortune may bring, If we go to the dogs—like the dogs In a pack we are able to sing Hullahbaloo! Though the coat may be worn with a badge— Or the kerchief no prize for a prig— Or the shirt never sent to the wash— There's the Gamut for little and big! O then come, rich and poor, young and old, For of course it's a very fine thing, Spite of Misery, Hunger, and cold, That we all are so able to sing Hullahbaloo! There are Demons to worry the rich, There are monsters to torture the poor, There's the Worm that will gnaw at the heart, There's the Wolf that will come to the door! We may even be short of the cash For the tax to a queen or a king, And the broker may sell off our beds, But we still shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! There's Consumption to wither the weak, There are fevers that humble the stout— A disease may be rife with the young, Or a pestilence walking about— Desolation may visit our hives, And old Death's metaphorical sting May dispose of the dearest of wives, But we all shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! We may farm at a very high rent, And with guano manure an inch deep, We may sow, whether broadcast or drill, And have only the whirlwind to reap; All our corn may be spoil'd in the ear, And our barns be ignited by Swing, And our sheep may die off with the rot, But we all shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! Our acquaintance may cut us direct, Even Love may become rather cold, And a friend of our earlier years May look shy at the coat that is old: We may not have a twig or a straw, Not a reed where affection may cling, Not a dog for our love, or a cat, But we still shall be able to sing, Hullahbaloo! Some are pallid with watching and want, Some are burning with blushes of shame; Some have lost all they had in the world, And are bankrupts in honour and name. Some have wasted a fortune in trade— And by going at all in the ring, Some have lost e'en a voice in the House; But they all will be able to sing Hullahbaloo! Some are deep in the Slough of Despond, And so sick of the burthen of life, That they dream of leaps over a bridge, Of the pistol, rope, poison and knife; To the Temples of Riches and Fame We are not going up in a string; And to some even Heaven seems black, But we all shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! We may give up the struggle with Care, And the last little hope that would stop, We may strive with a Giant Despair— From the very blue sky we may drop, By some sudden bewildering blow Stricken down like a bird on the wing,— Or with hearts breaking surely and slow— But we all shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! Oh! no matter how wretched we be, How ill-lodg'd, or ill-clad, or ill-fed, And with only one tile for a roof,— That we carry about on the head: We may croak with a very bad cold, Or a throat that's as dry as a ling,— There's the Street or the Stage for us all, For we all shall be able to sing Hullahbaloo! There's a Music aloft in the air, As if Cherubs were humming a song, Now it's high, now it's low, here and there, There's a Harmony floating along! While the steeples are loud in their joy, To the tune of the bells' ring-a-ding, Let us chime in a peal, one and all, For we all should be able to sing Hullahbaloo! EPIGRAM ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE STATUES IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE. If Nelson looks down on a couple of Kings, However it pleases the Loyals; 'Tis after the fashion of nautical things, A sky-scraper over the Royals. THE MARY. A SEA-SIDE SKETCH. Lov'st thou not, Alice, with the early tide To see the hardy Fisher hoist his mast, And stretch his sail towards the ocean wide,— Like God's own beadsman going forth to cast His net into the deep, which doth provide Enormous bounties, hidden in its vast Bosom like Charity's, for all who seek And take its gracious boon thankful and meek? The sea is bright with morning,—but the dark Seems still to linger on his broad black sail, For it is early hoisted, like a mark For the low sun to shoot at with his pale And level beams: All round the shadowy bark The green wave glimmers, and the gentle gale Swells in her canvas, till the waters show The keel's new speed, and whiten at the bow. Then look abaft—(for thou canst understand That phrase)—and there he sitteth at the stern, Grasping the tiller in his broad brown hand, The hardy Fisherman. Thou may'st discern Ten fathoms off the wrinkles in the tann'd And honest countenance that he will turn To look upon us, with a quiet gaze— As we are passing on our several ways. So, some ten days ago, on such a morn, The Mary, like a seamew, sought her spoil Amongst the finny race: 'twas when the corn Woo'd the sharp sickle, and the golden toil Summon'd all rustic hands to fill the horn Of Ceres to the brim, that brave turmoil Was at the prime, and Woodgate went to reap His harvest too, upon the broad blue deep. His mast was up, his anchor heaved aboard, His mainsail stretching in the first gray gleams Of morning, for the wind. Ben's eye was stored With fishes—fishes swam in all his dreams, And all the goodly east seem'd but a hoard Of silvery fishes, that in shoals and streams Groped into the deep dusk that fill'd the sky, For him to catch in meshes of his eye. For Ben had the true sailor's sanguine heart, And saw the future with a boy's brave thought, No doubts, nor faint misgivings had a part In his bright visions—ay, before he caught His fish, he sold them in the scaly mart, And summ'd the net proceeds. This should have brought Despair upon him when his hopes were foil'd, But though one crop was marr'd, again he toil'd And sow'd his seed afresh.—Many foul blights Perish'd his hardwon gains—yet he had plann'd No schemes of too extravagant delights— No goodly houses on the Goodwin sand— But a small humble home, and loving nights, Such as his honest heart and earnest hand Might fairly purchase. Were these hopes too airy? Such as they were, they rested on thee, Mary. She was the prize of many a toilsome year, And hardwon wages, on the perilous sea— Of savings ever since the shipboy's tear Was shed for home, that lay beyond the lee;— She was purveyor for his other dear Mary, and for the infant yet to be Fruit of their married loves. These made him dote Upon the homely beauties of his boat, Whose pitch black hull roll'd darkly on the wave, No gayer than one single stripe of blue Could make her swarthy sides. She seem'd a slave, A negro among boats—that only knew Hardship and rugged toil—no pennons brave Flaunted upon the mast—but oft a few Dark dripping jackets flutter'd to the air, Ensigns of hardihood and toilsome care. And when she ventured for the deep, she spread A tawny sail against the sunbright sky, Dark as a cloud that journeys overhead— But then those tawny wings were stretch'd to fly Across the wide sea desert for the bread Of babes and mothers—many an anxious eye Dwelt on her course, and many a fervent pray'r Invoked the Heavens to protect and spare. Where is she now? The secrets of the deep Are dark and hidden from the human ken; Only the sea-bird saw the surges sweep Over the bark of the devoted Ben,— Meanwhile a widow sobs and orphans weep, And sighs are heard from weatherbeaten men, Dark sunburnt men, uncouth and rude and hairy, While loungers idly ask, “Where is the Mary?” A DISCOVERY IN ASTRONOMY. One day—I had it from a hasty mouth Accustom'd to make many blunders daily, And therefore will not name, precisely, South, Herschell, or Baily— But one of those great men who watch the skies, With all their rolling, winking eyes, Was looking at that Orb whose ancient God Was patron of the Ode, and Song, and Sonnet, When thus he musing cried—“It's very odd That no Astronomer of all the squad Can tell the nature of those spots upon it!” “Lord, master!” mutter'd John, a liveried elf, “To wonder so at spots upon the sun! I'll tell you what he's done— Freckled hisself!” THE LADY'S DREAM. The lady lay in her bed, Her couch so warm and soft, But her sleep was restless and broken still; For turning often and oft From side to side, she mutter'd and moan'd, And toss'd her arms aloft. At last she startled up, And gazed on the vacant air, With a look of awe, as if she saw Some dreadful phantom there— And then in the pillow she buried her face From visions ill to bear. The very curtain shook, Her terror was so extreme; And the light that fell on the broider'd quilt Kept a tremulous gleam; And her voice was hollow, and shook as she cried:— “Oh me! that awful dream! “That weary, weary walk, In the churchyard's dismal ground! And those horrible things, with shady wings, That came and flitted round,— Death, death, and nothing but death, In every sight and sound! “And oh! those maidens young, Who wrought in that dreary room, With figures drooping and spectres thin, And cheeks without a bloom;— And the Voice that cried, ‘For the pomp of pride, We haste to an early tomb! “‘For the pomp and pleasure of Pride, We toil like Afric slaves, And only to earn a home at last, Where yonder cypress waves;’— And then they pointed—I never saw A ground so full of graves! “And still the coffins came, With their sorrowful trains and slow; Coffin after coffin still, A sad and sickening show; From grief exempt, I never had dreamt Of such a World of Woe! “Of the hearts that daily break, Of the tears that hourly fall, Of the many, many troubles of life, That grieve this earthly ball— Disease and Hunger, and Pain, and Want, But now I dreamt of them all! “For the blind and the cripple were there, And the babe that pined for bread, And the houseless man, and the widow poor Who begged—to bury the dead; The naked, alas, that I might have clad, The famish'd I might have fed! “The sorrow I might have sooth'd, And the unregarded tears; For many a thronging shape was there, From long forgotten years, Aye, even the poor rejected Moor, Who raised my childish fears! “Each pleading look, that long ago I scann'd with a heedless eye, Each face was gazing as plainly there, As when I pass'd it by: Woe, woe for me if the past should be Thus present when I die! “No need of sulphurous lake, No need of fiery coal, But only that crowd of human kind Who wanted pity and dole— In everlasting retrospect— Will wring my sinful soul! “Alas! I have walk'd through life Too heedless where I trod; Nay, helping to trample my fellow worm, And fill the burial sod— Forgetting that even the sparrow falls Not unmark'd of God! “I drank the richest draughts; And ate whatever is good— Fish, and flesh, and fowl, and fruit, Supplied my hungry mood; But I never remember'd the wretched ones That starve for want of food! “I dress'd as the noble dress, In cloth of silver and gold, With silk, and satin, and costly furs, In many an ample fold; But I never remember'd the naked limbs That froze with winter's cold. “The wounds I might have heal'd! The human sorrow and smart! And yet it never was in my soul To play so ill a part: But evil is wrought by want of Thought, As well as want of Heart!” She clasp'd her fervent hands, And the tears began to stream; Large, and bitter, and fast they fell, Remorse was so extreme: And yet, oh yet, that many a Dame Would dream the Lady's Dream!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VII. 1844. [Continued.] [Passing my brow, and passing my eyes] Passing my brow, and passing my eyes, And passing lower with devious range, Passing my chest, And passing the rest, I feel a something passing strange! Over my soul there seems to pass A middle state of life or death, And I almost seem to feel, alas! That I am drawing my passing breath! And, methinks I hear the passing-bell; But, Mr. Passmore, that reverend elf, Gives me a pass that I know well, A sort of passport to Heaven itself! Passing my brow, and passing my eye, And passing lower, with devious range, Passing my chest, And passing the rest, I feel a something passing strange! Oh, Mr. Eyre, Lieutenant dear! Oh! Lady Sale, thou gallant lass! I know for certain that ye are near, For I feel, I feel, the Khyber Pass! But no—'tis Brockedon passes my brow, And I'm in the Alpine Passes now, With icy valleys, and snowy crests, Whereon the passing vapour rests; And guide and English traveller pass, Each on a very passable ass! Passing my ear and passing my eye! O joy! what pastoral meads I spy, Full of lambs that frisk and feed While the Pastor plays on his rustic reed— To the very best of his humble ability, Piping ever shrill and loud, But oh! what new magnetic cloud Passes over my passability! Over my soul there seems to pass A middle state of life or death And I almost seem to feel, alas! That I am drawing my passing breath. No more prospects bright and sunny, No more chance of pleasant cheer, No more hope of passing money— I feel the pass of the Overseer! THE KEY. A MOORISH ROMANCE “On the east coast, towards Tunis, the Moors still preserve the keys of their ancestors' houses in Spain; to which country they still express the hopes of one day returning, and again planting the crescent on the ancient walls of the Alhambra.” —Scott's Travels in Morocco and Algiers. “Is Spain cloven in such a manner as to want closing?” Sancho Panza. The Moor leans on his cushion, With the pipe between his lips; And still at frequent intervals The sweet sherbét he sips; But, spite of lulling vapour And the sober cooling cup, The spirit of the swarthy Moor Is fiercely kindling up! One hand is on his pistol, On its ornamented stock, While his finger feels the trigger And is busy with the lock— The other seeks his ataghan, And clasps its jewell'd hilt— Oh! much of gore in days of yore That crooked blade has spilt! His brows are knit, his eyes of jet In vivid blackness roll, And gleam with fatal flashes Like the fire-damp of the coal; His jaws are set, and through his teeth He draws a savage breath, As if about to raise the shout Of Victory or Death! For why? the last Zebeck that came And moor'd within the Mole, Such tidings unto Tunis brought As stir his very soul— The cruel jar of civil war, The sad and stormy reign, That blackens like a thunder cloud The sunny land of Spain! No strife of glorious Chivalry, For honour's gain or loss, Nor yet that ancient rivalry, The Crescent with the Cross. No charge of gallant Paladins On Moslems stern and stanch; But Christians shedding Christian blood Beneath the olive's branch! A war of horrid parricide, And brother killing brother; Yea, like to “dogs and sons of dogs That worry one another. But let them bite and tear and fight, The more the Kaffers slay, The sooner Hagar's swarming sons Shall make the land a prey! The sooner shall the Moor behold Th' Alhambra's pile again; And those who pined in Barbary Shall shout for joy in Spain— The sooner shall the Crescent wave On dear Granada's walls: And proud Mohammed Ali sit Within his father's halls! “Alla-il-alla!” tiger-like Up springs the swarthy Moor, And, with a wide and hasty stride, Steps o'er the marble floor; Across the hall, till from the wall, Where such quaint patterns be, With eager hand he snatches down An old and massive Key! A massive Key of curious shape, And dark with dirt and rust, And well three weary centuries The metal might encrust! For since the King Boabdil fell Before the native stock, That ancient Key, so quaint to see, Hath never been in lock. Brought over by the Saracens Who fled across the main, A token of the secret hope Of going back again; From race to race, from hand to hand, From house to house it pass'd; O will it ever, ever ope The Palace gate at last? Three hundred years and fifty-two On post and wall it hung— Three hundred years and fifty-two A dream to old and young; But now a brighter destiny The Prophet's will accords: The time is come to scour the rust, And lubricate the wards. For should the Moor with sword and lance At Algesiras land, Where is the bold Bernardo now Their progress to withstand? To Burgos should the Moslem come, Where is the noble Cid Five royal crowns to topple down As gallant Diaz did? Hath Xeres any Pounder now, When other weapons fail, With club to thrash invaders rash, Like barley with a flail? Hath Seville any Perez still, To lay his clusters low, And ride with seven turbans green Around his saddle-bow? No! never more shall Europe see Such Heroes brave and bold, Such Valour, Faith, and Loyalty, As used to shine of old! No longer to one battle cry United Spaniards run, And with their thronging spears uphold The Virgin and her Son! From Cadiz Bay to rough Biscay Internal discord dwells, And Barcelona bears the scars Of Spanish shot and shells. The fleets decline, the merchants pine For want of foreign trade; And gold is scant; and Alicante Is seal'd by strict blockade! The loyal fly, and Valour falls, Opposed by court intrigue; But treachery and traitors thrive, Upheld by foreign league; While factions seeking private ends By turns usurping reign— Well may the dreaming, scheming Moor Exulting point to Spain! Well may he cleanse the rusty Key With Afric sand and oil, And hope an Andalusian home Shall recompense the toil! Well may he swear the Moorish spear Through wild Castile shall sweep, And where the Catalonian sowed The Saracen shall reap! Well may he vow to spurn the Cross Beneath the Arab hoof, And plant the Crescent yet again Above th' Alhambra's roof— When those from whom St. Jago's name In chorus once arose, Are shouting Faction's battle-cries, And Spain forgets to “Close!” Well may he swear his ataghan Shall rout the traitor swarm, And carve them into Arabesques That show no human form— The blame be theirs whose bloody feuds Invite the savage Moor, And tempt him with the ancient Key To seek the ancient door! THE WORKHOUSE CLOCK. AN ALLEGORY. There's a murmur in the air, And noise in every street— The murmur of many tongues, The noise of numerous feet— While round the Workhouse door The Labouring Classes flock, For why? the Overseer of the Poor Is setting the Workhouse Clock. Who does not hear the tramp Of thousands speeding along Of either sex and various stamp, Sickly, crippled, or strong, Walking, limping, creeping From court, and alley, and lane, But all in one direction sweeping Like rivers that seek the main? Who does not see them sally From mill, and garret, and room, In lane, and court and alley, From homes in poverty's lowest valley, Furnished with shuttle and loom— Poor slaves of Civilization's galley— And in the road and footways rally, As if for the Day of Doom? Some, of hardly human form, Stunted, crooked, and crippled by toil; Dingy with smoke and dust and oil, And smirch'd besides with vicious soil, Clustering, mustering, all in a swarm. Father, mother, and careful child, Looking as if it had never smiled— The Sempstress, lean, and weary, and wan, With only the ghosts of garments on— The Weaver, her sallow neighbour, The grim and sooty Artisan; Every soul—child, woman, or man, Who lives—or dies—by labour. Stirr'd by an overwhelming zeal, And social impulse, a terrible throng! Leaving shuttle, and needle, and wheel, Furnace, and grindstone, spindle, and reel, Thread, and yarn, and iron, and steel— Yea, rest and the yet untasted meal— Gushing, rushing, crushing along, A very torrent of Man! Urged by the sighs of sorrow and wrong, Grown at last to a hurricane strong, Stop its course who can! Stop who can its onward course And irresistible moral force; O! vain and idle dream! For surely as men are all akin, Whether of fair or sable skin, According to Nature's scheme, That Human Movement contains within A Blood-Power stronger than Steam. Onward, onward, with hasty feet, They swarm—and westward still— Masses born to drink and eat, But starving amidst Whitechapel's meat, And famishing down Cornhill! Through the Poultry—but still unfed— Christian Charity, hang your head! Hungry—passing the Street of Bread; Thirsty—the street of Milk; Ragged—beside the Ludgate Mart, So gorgeous, through Mechanic-Art, With cotton, and wool, and silk! At last, before that door That bears so many a knock Ere ever it opens to Sick or Poor, Like sheep they huddle and flock— And would that all the Good and Wise Could see the Million of hollow eyes, With a gleam deriv'd from Hope and the skies, Upturn'd to the Workhouse Clock! Oh! that the Parish Powers, Who regulate Labour's hours, The daily amount of human trial, Weariness, pain, and self-denial Would turn from the artificial dial That striketh ten or eleven, And go, for once, by that older one That stands in the light of Nature's sun, And takes its time from Heaven! THE BRIDGE OF SIGHS. “Drown'd! drown'd!” —Hamlet. [PART I.] One more Unfortunate, Weary of breath, Rashly importunate, Gone to her death! Take her up tenderly, Lift her with care; Fashion'd so slenderly, Young, and so fair! Look at her garments Clinging like cerements; Whilst the wave constantly Drips from her clothing; Take her up instantly, Loving, not loathing.— Touch her not scornfully; Think of her mournfully, Gently and humanly; Not of the stains of her, All that remains of her Now is pure womanly. Make no deep scrutiny Into her mutiny Rash and undutiful: Past all dishonour, Death has left on her Only the beautiful. Still, for all slips of hers, One of Eve's family— Wipe those poor lips of hers Oozing so clammily. Loop up her tresses Escaped from the comb, Her fair auburn tresses; Whilst wonderment guesses Where was her home? Who was her father? Who was her mother? Had she a sister? Had she a brother? Or was there a dearer one Still, and a nearer one Yet, than all other? Alas! for the rarity Of Christian charity Under the sun! Oh! it was pitiful! Near a whole city full, Home she had none. Sisterly, brotherly, Fatherly, motherly Feelings had changed: Love, by harsh evidence, Thrown from its eminence; Even God's providence Seeming estranged. Where the lamps quiver So far in the river, With many a light From window and casement, From garret to basement, She stood, with amazement, Houseless by night. The bleak wind of March Made her tremble and shiver; But not the dark arch, Or the black flowing river: Mad from life's history, Glad to death's mystery, Swift to be hurl'd— Any where, any where Out of the world! In she plunged boldly, No matter how coldly The rough river ran,— Over the brink of it, Picture it—think of it, Dissolute Man! Lave in it, drink of it. Then, if you can! Take her up tenderly, Lift her with care; Fashion'd so slenderly, Young, and so fair! Ere her limbs frigidly Stiffen too rigidly, Decently,—kindly,— Smoothe, and compose them; And her eyes, close them, Staring so blindly! Dreadfully staring Thro' muddy impurity, As when with the daring Last look of despairing Fix'd on futurity. Perishing gloomily, Spurr'd by contumely, Cold inhumanity, Burning insanity, Into her rest.— Cross her hands humbly, As if praying dumbly, Over her breast! Owning her weakness, Her evil behaviour, And leaving, with meekness, Her sins to her Saviour! PART II. [Fragmentary verses from the MSS. connected with The Bridge of Sighs.] Weary with troubles That Death must deliver Once more life bubbles Away in the river— The moon in the river shone And the stars some six or seven— Poor child of sin, to throw it therein Seemed sending it to Heaven. Cover her, cover her, Throw the earth over her— Victim of murder inhumanly done; With gravel and sod— Hide—hide her from God, And the light of the sun! THE LAY OF THE LABOURER. [Verse extracted from the prose narrative.] A spade! a rake! a hoe! A pickaxe, or a bill! A hook to reap, or a scythe to mow, A flail, or what ye will— And here's a ready hand To ply the needful tool, And skill'd enough, by lessons rough, In Labour's rugged school. To hedge, or dig the ditch, To lop or fell the tree, To lay the swarth on the sultry field, Or plough the stubborn lea; The harvest stack to bind, The wheaten rick to thatch, And never fear in my pouch to find The tinder or the match. To a flaming barn or farm My fancies never roam; The fire I yearn to kindle and burn Is on the hearth of Home; Where children huddle and crouch Through dark long wintry days, Where starving children huddle and crouch, To see the cheerful rays, A-glowing on the haggard cheek, And not in the haggard's blaze! To Him who sends a drought To parch the fields forlorn, The rain to flood the meadows with mud, The blight to blast the corn, To Him I leave to guide The bolt in its crooked path, To strike the miser's rick, and show The skies blood-red with wrath. A spade! a rake! a hoe! A pickaxe, or a bill! A hook to reap, or a scythe to mow, A flail, or what ye will— The corn to thrash, or the hedge to plash, The market-team to drive, Or mend the fence by the cover side, And leave the game alive. Ay, only give me work, And then you need not fear That I shall snare his Worship's hare, Or kill his Grace's deer; Break into his lordship's house, To steal the plate so rich; Or leave the yeoman that had a purse To welter in a ditch. Wherever Nature needs, Wherever Labour calls, No job I'll shirk of the hardest work, To shun the workhouse walls; Where savage laws begrudge The pauper babe its breath, And doom a wife to a widow's life, Before her partner's death. My only claim is this, With labour stiff and stark, By lawful turn, my living to earn, Between the light and dark; My daily bread, and nightly bed, My bacon, and drop of beer— But all from the hand that holds the land. And none from the overseer! No parish money, or loaf, No pauper badges for me, A son of the soil, by right of toil Entitled to my fee. No alms I ask, give me my task: Here are the arm, the leg, The strength, the sinews of a Man, To work, and not to beg. Still one of Adam's heirs, Though doom'd by chance of birth To dress so mean, and to eat the lean Instead of the fat of the earth; To make such humble meals As honest labour can, A bone and a crust, with a grace to God, And little thanks to man! A spade! a rake! a hoe! A pickaxe, or a bill! A hook to reap, or a scythe to mow, A flail, or what ye will— Whatever the tool to ply, Here is a willing drudge, With muscle and limb, and woe to him Who does their pay begrudge! Who every weekly score Docks labour's little mite, Bestows on the poor at the temple door, But robb'd them over night. The very shilling he hoped to save, As health and morals fail, Shall visit me in the New Bastille, The Spital, or the Gaol! EPIGRAM. ON HER MAJESTY'S VISIT TO THE CITY, 1844.

BY A TRADESMAN IN CORNHILL. Sure the measure is strange That all Commerce so stops, And, to open a 'Change, Make us shut up our shops. SONNET TO A SONNET. Particularly commended, with the Fifth of Sir Philip Sidney's, and the pages of Froissart, to the perusal of certain Journalists across the Channel; and generally to their Young countrymen, who would do well to affect, with the beards and moustaches of the olden time, the gallant courtesy of the ancient manners. Rare Composition of a Poet-Knight, Most chivalrous amongst chivalric men, Distinguish'd for a polish'd lance and pen In tuneful contest, and the tourney-fight; Lustrous in scholarship, in honour bright, Accomplish'd in all graces current then, Humane as any in historic ken, Brave, handsome, noble, affable, polite, Most courteous to that race become of late So fiercely scornful of all kind advance, Rude, bitter, coarse, implacable in hate To Albion, plotting ever her mischance,— Alas! fair Verse, how false and out of date Thy phrase “sweet enemy” applied to France! EPIGRAM. ON A PICTURE (407) IN THE BRITISH INSTITUTION, 1843. Sir, let me just your tasteful eye enveigle To yonder Painting, of the Madman Eagle. Which, that by Poole? Excuse me, sir, I beg, I really have no wish to catch “The Plague.” THE SAUSAGE MAKER'S GHOST. A LONDON LEGEND. Somewhere in Leather Lane— I wonder that it was not Mincing, And for this reason most convincing, That Mr. Brain Dealt in those well-minced cartridges of meat Some people like to eat— However, all such quibbles overstepping, In Leather Lane he lived; and drove a trade In porcine sausages, though London made, Call'd “Epping.” Right brisk was the demand, Seldom his goods stay'd long on hand, For out of all adjacent courts and lanes, Young Irish ladies and their swains— Such soups of girls and broths of boys!— Sought his delicious chains, Preferr'd to all polonies, saveloys, And other foreign toys— The mere chance passengers Who saw his “sassengers,” Of sweetness undeniable, So sleek, so mottled, and so “friable,” Stepp'd in, forgetting ev'ry other thought, And bought. Meanwhile a constant thumping Was heard, a sort of subterranean chumping— Incessant was the noise! But though he had a foreman and assistant, With all the tools consistent, (Besides a wife and two fine chopping boys) His means were not yet vast enough For chopping fast enough To meet the call from streets, and lanes, and passages, For first-chop “sassages.” However, Mr. Brain Was none of those dull men and slow, Who, flying bird-like by a railway train, Sigh for the heavy mails of long ago; He did not set his face 'gainst innovations For rapid operations, And therefore in a kind of waking dream Listen'd to some hot-water sprite that hinted To have his meat chopp'd, as the Times was printed, By steam! Accordingly in happy hour, A bran-new Engine went to work Chopping up pounds on pounds of pork With all the energy of Two-Horse-Power, And wonderful celerity— When lo! when ev'rything to hope responded, Whether his head was turn'd by his prosperity, Whether he had some sly intrigue, in verity, The man absconded! His anxious Wife in vain Placarded Leather Lane, And all the suburbs with descriptive bills, Such as are issued when from homes and tills Clerks, dogs, cats, lunatics, and children roam; Besides advertisements in all the journals, Or weeklies or diurnals, Beginning “Left his Home”— The sausage-maker, spite of white and black, Never came back. Never, alive!—But on the seventh night, Just when the yawning grave its dead releases, Filling his bedded wife with sore affright In walk'd his grisly Sprite, In fifty thousand pieces! “O Mary!” so it seem'd In hollow melancholy tone to say, Whilst thro' its airy shape the moonlight gleam'd With scarcely dimmer ray,— “O Mary! let your hopes no longer flatter, Prepare at once to drink of sorrow's cup— It ain't no use to mince the matter— The Engine's chopp'd me up!” A DREAM. 'Twas night—the Globe was folded up, (The paper, not the earth,) And to its proper shelf restored The fairest “Maid of Perth:” But still with strange intricacy The things that I had read— The Irish News, the Scottish Tale— Kept running in my head; While over all a sort of mist Began to slowly creep, The twilight haze of Thought, before It darkens into Sleep; A foggy land where shady shapes Kept stirring in the gloom, Till with a hint of brighter tint One spot began to bloom, And on the blank, by dreamy prank, saw a Figure tall, As vivid as from painted glass, Projected on a wall! The face as well as I could trace, Two sparkling eyes were there, Black as the beard, and trim moustache, And curling head of hair; The nose was straight, the mouth was large, The lips disclosed beneath A set, full white and regular, Of strong and handsome teeth— The whiter, that his brow and cheek, And thick uncovered gorge, Were ruddy as if baked by heat Of sun or glowing forge. His dress was buff, or some such stuff, And belted at the waist; A curious dirk, for stabbing work, Was in the girdle placed, Beside a sort of pouch or purse Of some wild creature's skin, To safely hold his store of gold Or silver coin therein;— But—suddenly his doublet changed To one of brighter hue, A jerkin fair and superfine, Of cloth of azure blue, Slash'd front and back with satin black, Embroider'd o'er and laced With sable silk, as used to suit The ancient time and taste; His hose were of the Flemish cut, His boots of Cordovan; A velvet bonnet on his head, Like that of Scottish man,— Nay, not a velvet one,—for why, As dreams are apt to deal, With sudden change, as swift as strange, It shone a cap of steel! His coat of buff, or azure stuff, Became a hauberk bright, No longer gay in his array, But harness'd for the Fight! Huge was his frame, and muscular, Indicative of strength: His bosom broad, his brawny arms Of more than common length; And well the sturdy limbs might be So sinewy, stark, and strong, That had to wield in battle-field A sword so broad and long! Few men there were of mortal mould, Although of warlike trade, But had been rash to stand the crash Of that tremendous blade; And yet aloft he swung it oft, As if of feather weight, And cut amid the empty air A monstrous figure eight; Whilst ever, as it cleft the wind, A whisper came therewith, That low and clear, said in my ear, “Behold the Fighting Smith!” And lo! another “change came o'er The spirit of my dream:” The hauberk bright no longer shone With that metallic gleam— No ruddy visage furnace-scorch'd, With glowing eyes, was there, No sable beard, no trim moustache, Nor head of raven hair; No steely cap, with plume mayhap, No bonnet small or big; Upon his brow there settled now A curly powder'd Wig! Beneath the chin two cambric bands Demurely drooped adown; And from his brawny shoulders hung A black forensic gown. No mail beneath, to guard from death, Or wounds in battle dealt, Nor ready dirk for stabbing work, Dependent at his belt— His right hand bore no broad claymore, But with a flourish, soon He waved a Pistol huge enough For any horse-dragoon, And whilst he pointed to and fro, As if to aim therewith, Still in my ear, the voice was clear, “Behold the Fighting Smith!” THE LAY OF THE LARK. With dew upon its breast And sunshine on its wing, The lark uprose from its happy nest And thus it seemed to sing:— “Sweet, sweet! from the middle of the wheat To meet the morning gray, To leave the corn on a merry morn, Nor have to curse the day.” With the dew upon their breast, And the sunlight on their wing, Towards the skies from the furrows rise The larks, and thus they sing:— “If you would know the cause That makes us sing so gay, It is because we hail and bless, And never curse the day. Sweet, sweet! from the middle of the wheat (Where lurk our callow brood) Where we were hatch'd, and fed Amidst the corn on a very merry morn (We never starve for food.) We never starve for bread!” Those flowers so very blue Those poppies flaming red, His heavy eye was glazed and dull, He only murmur'd “bread!” FRAGMENT.

STANZAS. [Farewell, Life! My senses swim] Farewell, Life! My senses swim; And the world is growing dim; Thronging shadows cloud the light, Like the advent of the night,— Colder, colder, colder still Upward steals a vapour chill— Strong the earthy odour grows— I smell the Mould above the Rose! Welcome, Life! the Spirit strives! Strength returns, and hope revives; Cloudy fears and shapes forlorn Fly like shadows at the morn,— O'er the earth there comes a bloom— Sunny light for sullen gloom, Warm perfume for vapour cold— I smell the Rose above the Mould! APPENDIX. [Come, come, I am very] Come, come, I am very Disposed to be merry— So hey! for a wherry I beckon and bawl! 'Tis dry, not a damp night, And pleasure will tramp light To music and lamp light At shining Vauxhall! Ay, here's the dark postal— The check-taking mortal I pass, and turn short all At once on the blaze— Names famous in story, Lit up con amore, All flaming in glory, Distracting the gaze! Oh my name lies fallow— Fame never will hallow In red light and yellow Poetical toil— I've long tried to write up My name, and take flight up; But ink will not light up Like cotton and oil! But sad thoughts, keep under!— The painted Rotunder Invites me. I wonder Who's singing so clear? 'Tis Sinclair, high-flying, Scotch ditties supplying; But some hearts are sighing For Dignum, I fear! How bright is the lustre, How thick the folks muster, And eagerly cluster, On bench and in box,— Whilst Povey is waking Sweet sounds, or the taking Kate Stephens is shaking Her voice and her locks! What clapping attends her!— The white doe befriends her— How Braham attends her Away by the hand, For Love to succeed her; The Signor doth heed her, And sigheth to lead her Instead of the band! Then out we all sally— Time's ripe for the Ballet, Like bees they all rally Before the machine!— But I am for tracing The bright walks and facing The groups that are pacing To see and be seen. How motley they mingle— What men might one single, And names that would tingle Or tickle the ear— Fresh Chinese contrivers Of letters—survivors Of pawnbrokers—divers Beau Tibbses appear! Such little and great men, And civic and state men— Collectors and rate-men— How pleasant to nod To friends—to note fashions, To make speculations On people and passions— To laugh at the odd! To sup on true slices Of ham—with fair prices For fowl—while cool ices And liquors abound— To see Blackmore wander, A small salamander, Adown the rope yonder, And light on the ground! Oh, the fireworks are splendid; But darkness is blended— Bright things are soon ended, Fade quickly and fall! There goes the last rocket!— Some cash out of pocket, By stars in the socket, I go from Vauxhall! TO MISS KELLY, OF THE ENGLISH OPERA HOUSE. Kelly, two quiet hours agone, Thy part was o'er, the play was done, The tragic vision fled. My lobster salad is discuss'd, My wine and water mingled just, And thou art in my head! Clifford is gone—for all the while, And Baker's everlasting smile, Is vanish'd from me quite, Like foolish portraits on a wall, Sway'd by a curtain's rise or fall, And not for after sight. But thou, without or with my will, Thy ringing tones attend me still, And melancholy looks; Again I see, and echo these Again, like golden passages Gather'd from olden books. Not apt to lend my faith to cheats, Or look for honey in the sweets Of artificial flowers; Though critical and curst withall, Though early mingled grief and gall, I recognise thy powers. Tears thou canst bring, where tears have sprung, Oft, from an aching heart—not wrung By griefs at second hand; And smiles, to lips that have not curl'd Seldom at humours of a world Most vigilantly scann'd. And years bring very chilly damps, That dim the splendour of the lamps, And shame the canvas skies; The brightest scenes, I know not how, Have changed—and Mrs. Grove is now No fairy in my eyes. I cannot weep when lovers weep, Nor throne a tyrant in my sleep, Nor quake at tragic screams; The fond, the fervent faith is flown Of boyhood; and a play is grown Less real than my dreams. And yet when I confront thee, still I quite forget that sullen chill, So perfect is thy art; Again the vision cheats my soul, For why? Thou dost present a whole, Where others play a part. The saddest or the shrewdest flights Of tragical or comic wights Are ne'er put out of joint, And things by feebler authors writ, Are better'd by thy better wit, And dullness finds a point. A kind of verbal novelist, Up and down life, thou dost enlist All humours, high and low; That, dramatised, inform thy face And voice, with every trick and trace Of human whim and woe! The stage, it is thy element, Wherein thy mind preserves its bent, Thou dost not seek or scorn, The critic's meed, the public praise, As if ordain'd to live in plays,— Not actress made, but born! HINTS TO PAUL PRY. Oh, pleasing, teasing, Mr. Pry, Dear Paul—but not Virginia's Paul, As some might haply deem, to spy The umbrella thou art arm'd withal, Cool hat, and ample pantaloons, Proper for hot and tropic noons;— Oh no! for thou wert never born To watch the barren sea and cloud In any desert isle forlorn— Thy home is always in a crowd Drawn nightly, such is thy stage luck, By Liston—that dramatic Buck. True as the evening's primrose flower, True as the watchman to his beat, Thou dost attend upon the hour And house, in old Haymarket Street. Oh, surely thou art much miscall'd, Still Paul—yet we are never pall'd! Friend of the keyhole and the crack, That lets thee pry within and pore, Thy very nose betrays the knack— Upturn'd through kissing with the door; A peeping trick that each dear friend Sends thee to Coventry, to mend! Thy bended body shows thy bent, Inclined to news in every place; Thy gossip mouth and eyes intent. Stand each a query in thy face; Thy hat a curious hat appears, Pricking its brims up like thy ears; Thy pace, it is an ambling trot, To post thee sooner here and there, To every house where thou shouldst not, In gait, in garb, in face, and air, The true eavesdropper we perceive, Not merely dropping in at eve,— But morn and noon, through all the span Of day,—to disconcert and fret, Unwelcome guest to every man, A kind of dun, without a debt, Well cursed by porter in the hall, For calling when there is no call. Harm-watching, harm thou still dost catch— That rule should save thee many a sore; But watch thou wilt, and, like a watch, A box attends thee at the door— The household menials e'en begin To show thee out ere thou art in! Old Grasp regards thee with a frown, Old Hardy marks thee for a shot, Young Stanley longs to knock thee down, And Subtle mourns her ruin'd plot, And bans thy bones—alas! for why! A tender curiosity! Oh leave the Hardys to themselves— Leave Mrs. Subtle to her dreams— 'Tis true that they were laid on shelves— Leave Stanley, junior, to his schemes; More things there are, the public sigh To know the rights of, Mr. Pry! There's Lady L? the late Miss P?, Miss P? and lady both were late, And two in ten can scarce agree, For why the title had to wait; But thou mightst learn from her own lips What wind detain'd the lady-ship? Or Mr. P!—the sire that nursed Thy youth, and made thee what thou art, Who form'd thy prying genius first— (Thou wottest his untender part), 'Twould be a friendly call and fit, To know “how soon he hopes to sit.” Some people long to know the truth Whether Miss T. does mean to try For Gibbon once again—in sooth, Thou mightst indulge them, Mr. Pry: A verbal extract from the brief Would give some spinsters great relief! Suppose, dear Pry, thou wert to dodge The porter's glance, and just drop in At Windsor's shy sequester'd lodge, (Thou wilt, if any man can win His way so far)—and kindly bring Poor Cob's petition to the king. There's Mrs. Coutts—hath she outgrown The compass of a prying eye? And, ah! there is the Great Unknown, A man that makes the curious sigh; 'Twere worthy of your genius quite To bring that lurking man to light. O, come abroad, with curious hat, And patch'd umbrella, curious too— To poke with this, and pry with that— Search all our scandal through and through, And treat the whole world like a pie Made for thy finger, Mr. Pry!</field>
