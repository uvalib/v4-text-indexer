      <field name="fulltext">ADVENT. O Thou, who cam'st a Saviour meek, Of old, mankind's lost race to seek; And who again shalt come, And, seated on thy glory's throne, Thy Father's glory and thy own, Pronounce their final doom! When thrilling through the vast profound, Thy hosts shall shout, thy trumpet sound, And the Archangel's cry Summon the slumbering nations forth, From east, and west, and south, and north, To meet thee in the sky: When, answering to that summons dread, The earth and sea shall yield their dead; And death, and death's abode Give up their prey the quick to meet; And quick and dead, and small and great, Appear before their God: When the unfolded book shall shew To saints above and men below The true, the stern record; And each foul deed, in secret wrought, Each idle word, each guilty thought, Attend its due reward: Oh! in that fearful hour of doom, Lord, how shall sinful man presume To stand before thy throne; Nor on the rocks and mountains call Swift on his conscious head to fall, And hide him from thy frown? Be mine, in this my day of grace, Intent before my eyes to place The lot of him who sins; And in my heart this truth to store, That, when the day of grace is o'er, The day of wrath begins! Be mine, or ere my day be past, Away the deeds of night to cast, The arms of light to wield; Truth's zone of strength, the shoes of peace, The breastplate firm of righteousness, And faith's unblemish'd shield! Be mine salvation's helm; and mine The living Spirit's sword divine, Thy own unerring word: With pray'r, sure guard, my heart to aid, Too oft by ease from duty sway'd, Too oft by toil deterr'd! So may I fight the Christian fight, Strong in the bulwark of thy might! And, trusting, Lord, in thee, With holy hope thy coming greet, And, prostrate at thy judgment seat, Await thy just decree! THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD, OR THE BIRTH-DAY OF CHRIST, COMMONLY CALLED CHRISTMAS-DAY. Glory to Thee, who didst of old inspire Isaiah's soul with energy divine, And touch his lips with consecrated fire By seraph hand brought from before thy shrine Isaiah vi. 6.. To Israel's monarch he proclaim'd a sign, Mark of the future heir of Israel's throne: “Behold! on earth, of heavenly origin, A Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, Emmanuel, twofold Being, God and man in one Isaiah vii. 14..” Glory to Thee, whose Spirit largely shed “With judgment, power, and might Micah iii. 8.” on Micah came, What time to Judah's chiefs the praise he spread Of David's city, Judah's Bethlehem: “Though small thy portion, yet shall be thy name High 'mong the thousands of thy tribe enroll'd; For thou the birth of Israel's King shalt claim, Whose goings forth have been from ages old, Or ere the orb of day the times revolving told Micah v. 2..” Glory to Thee, whose ear in mercy heard Thy Daniel for his captive people plead, And sent thy angel to announce the word Of consolation in the hour of need: “Thy prayer is granted, and the time decreed; Ev'n now thy Zion shall her state resume. Full seventy weeks their destin'd course shall speed, And then again shall Zion meet her doom: But ere again she fall, the Anointed Prince shall come Daniel ix. 20–27..” Glory to Thee! But who can duly scan The varied stores of thy prophetick page? Charg'd with the parts of one harmonious plan, Successive prophets rise and quit the stage. By patriarch, monarch, shepherd, priest, and sage, As in a glass, each future scene is shewn. Clime to far clime, and age to distant age, Mid victory's shouts, mid slavery's captive moan, Proclaim the wondrous Child, and mark him for thine own. But lo! away the destin'd weeks are roll'd: And now in Bethlehem's lowly stable laid, The wondrous Child enraptur'd eyes behold, Child of the blest, the highly-favour'd Maid. The scatter'd rays of holy light that play'd O'er the recording volume of thy book, Converging all, on him at once are stay'd, Who God-begotten man's frail nature took; And on that mystick birth angels come forth to look. And hark! to celebrate that mystick birth, Unwonted floods of glorious light among, Glad tidings of great joy to all the earth Are heard peal'd forth from many a heavenly tongue. “Glory to God most high,” resounds along The illumin'd regions of the midnight sky. God, give us grace to catch that joyful song, To echo back from earth the cherubs' cry, And with thy angels hymn “Glory to Thee most high!” THE CIRCUMCISION OF CHRIST. Jesus! for o'er every name Thine preeminence may claim; Jesus! Saviour! for to thee All creation bows the knee: Mortal and immortal birth, Things in heav'n, and things on earth; Nor can dens of deepest night Bar thy hand, or shun thy sight! Lo! thy sheltering arm we crave; Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! From the ills and woes that wait On our frail and feeble state; From the inborn taint of sin, Rankling deep the soul within; From the tempter's subtle skill, Baffled, but returning still; From thy wrath's resistless storm; From the never-dying worm; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave: Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! From a heart perverse and blind; From a dark dissembling mind; From a soul, where passions reign, Lofty pride, self-flattery vain, Hate and malice fierce and fell, “Envy making heaven a hell,” Deeds with hard unkindness fraught, Angry word, ungentle thought; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave; Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! From the works of night and shame; From the guilt, whate'er its name, Which thy threaten'd vengeance dares; From the world's insidious snares, Treacherous all, tho' fair to see; From the world's arch-deity; From our evil lusts combin'd Still the better sense to blind; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave; Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! From the howling tempest's force; From the lightning's thrilling course; From the air's malignant breath, Charg'd with famine, plague, and death; From the battle's bloody strife; From the dark assassin's knife; From the death of direst mien, Unprepar'd for, unforeseen; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave: Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! From rebellion, blood-defil'd; Secret plot, and outrage wild; From the ills, thy truth that mar, Factious broil, intestine jar, Heresy with specious tone; From the scorner's heart of stone, Eyes, the light that will not see, Lips, that mock thy word and thee; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave: Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! In the time of dark distress, When we feel the tempest press; When the cheerful sun we feel, In the tempting time of weal; In the solemn hour of death, When to thee we yield our breath; When for thee we burst the tomb, In the fearful day of doom; Thy deliverance, Lord, we crave: Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! Jesus! for o'er every name Thine preeminence may claim: Jesus! Saviour! for to thee All creation bows the knee, By the Father charg'd to own Thee his lov'd, his honour'd Son: Thou for us hast shed thy blood; Thou the pow'rs of hell withstood; Thou hast triumph'd o'er the grave: Hear us, Saviour, hear and save! THE EPIPHANY, OR THE MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST TO THE GENTILES. And who are they, yon ancient men, from Sheba's spicy land, Who journey on, a pilgrim train, o'er wastes of burning sand?— Those ancient men are sages vers'd in science' varied store, But most in heavenly musings nurs'd and astronomick lore. And what is that, yon brilliant star, whereon their eyes are placed, Which beams with stedfast light from far across the trackless waste?— That brilliant star no fellow deem of such as gild the night: 'Tis hung in heaven with mystick beam to guide those sages right. And whither tend those ancient men, and what their point of rest, As straight o'er mountain, plain, and glen, they journey tow'rd the west?— Behold, they reach, they pass the bound of holy Palestine; And now they compass Sion's mount, where Salem's turrets shine. And “where,” they cry, “ye learned priests, is Judah's new-born King? His star has led us from the east, to him our gifts we bring.”— “Judea's King is Christ the Lord, the heir of David's crown: His birth-place, mark the prophet's word, is Bethlehem, David's town.” So on they fare: the word divine has heavenly light supplied; Nor need they now the star to shine, their journey's wonted guide. Till its fair beam of level light one favour'd spot display, Source of their passing great delight, goal of their lengthen'd way. The search is sped: the journey o'er: they see the Child, and, lo! All-prostrate on the humble floor their limbs adoring throw: And in, their precious stores they bear, their country's wealth unfold, And offer gifts of worship, myrrh, and frankincense, and gold. Gifts of high price, and homage great, to lay the Babe before; Betokening him of royal state a child; perhaps of more. Yet marks of pomp around him none that royal state attest: His court a lowly shed, his throne a lowly mother's breast. Faith, deep and strong, of heavenly source; fruit of no earthly soil! Which bore them through their tedious course of peril, care, and toil: Nor stumbled at their place of rest; but in that mean abode The long sought babe their King confest; their King, perchance their God. Their faith be mine! be mine to tread, where God shall point the way; Nor let fatigue my steps impede, nor danger's face dismay! Be mine to mark with stedfast look his guiding sign from far, And in his own enlightening book still find my leading star! And so be mine that wondrous Child with choicest gifts to greet; Bright deeds of love, thoughts undefil'd, and pray'r, as incense sweet: His state though outward meanness veil, his royal state to own; And with devout prostration hail the Lord of Israel's throne! THE PRESENTATION OF CHRIST IN THE TEMPLE, COMMONLY CALLED THE PURIFICATION OF SAINT MARY THE VIRGIN. When to the temple I repair, Thy house, O God, the house of pray'r, Or ere thy white-robed priest Invite his gather'd flock to raise The voice of penitence and praise, From holy hearts addrest; Thy word employs my musing mind: Nor other scene more apt I find To lift the heavenward thought, Than when the mother undefil'd, To grace thy courts, her first-born child A blameless offering brought. That mother undefil'd I see Present her blameless offering, free From sinful spot or stain: Best gift, that e'er by God was given To man; best gift and worthiest heaven, By man return'd again. My heart responds; and bids me haste Before my God a body chaste And spirit pure to lay; And with whate'er of rich or good, Thy love in bounty hath bestow'd, That bounteous love repay. Again I muse: and lo, appears Simeon, that seer of many years, That man devout and just: His arms infold the Babe divine, His lips avouch salvation's sign, His long-expected trust. Again responsive beats my heart; It yearns to take the prophet's part, To hymn the prophet's lay; To bless thee for thy saving grace, The glory of thine Israel's race, The Gentiles' rising day. Nor fail I then in order due That widow'd prophetess to view, By kindred zeal possest: Tho' fourscore years and four had shed Their hoary winters on her head, They had not chill'd her breast. And aye she warns me to resort Unwearied to thy hallow'd court, Thine own appointed place; To serve my God by day, by night, Observant of each holy rite, And trust thy promis'd grace. Thus musing on the train, who trod On that high day the house of God, I fan devotion's fire; And cherish thoughts chastis'd and meek, Love that would fain thy praises speak, And zeal that would not tire: And beg, that whom in thought I see Presented in thy house to thee, May bless this house of pray'r; While to the footstool of thy throne My gifts I bring by him alone To be presented there. THE FORTY DAYS OF LENT. “Review the kingdoms of the world that lie Within the range of thine extended eye; And add all those, from viewless distance brought, Which fill the scope and compass of thy thought: All these are mine; and thine they all shall be, If thou wilt prostrate fall, and own and worship me.” Who speaks the word? 'Tis the false fiend, 'tis he Whose name denotes the sire of calumny: The Tempter: he, by whom the angels fell, And Eden's garden wore the gloom of hell: Satan, the enemy avow'd, the foe Of God and saints above, and man's weak race below. O, is there one, whose form erect and mind Bear, heaven-imprest, the stamp of human kind; Who yet forgetting whence his being rose, Forgetting all he has, and all he owes, Would at thy beck, vile Spirit, bow the knee, Renounce his sovereign Lord, and own, and worship thee? O, is there one? Yon murderer survey, Who marks with peering eyes his destin'd prey, Beguiles him from the haunts of men apart, And plants the unseen dagger in his heart; Then on his blameless brother throws the guilt, Smear'd with the accusing blood his slaughterous hand hath spilt! O, is there one? Yon profligate behold, In all the stratagems of crime grown old; With glozing tongue, and virtue's fair pretence, He weaves his snares for female innocence; Rifles the virgin's bloom, and leaves her bare To reckless vice a prey, or comfortless despair! O, is there one? Yon harden'd recreant see, Steep'd to the lips in dregs of blasphemy: From the lorn heart he rends its healing faith, In life its solace, and its hope in death: And, glorying in his shame, God's truth denies, Rejects his proffer'd grace, his threaten'd wrath defies! Yes, these and more there are, a hideous train! Who claim their portion in thy wide domain, False slanderer, tempter, foe to man and God! Submit their heav'n-born spirit to thy nod, List thy high mandate, bend the servile knee, Renounce their sovereign Lord, and own and worship thee!— Saviour of men, whose youthful prime, enur'd To holiness, the Tempter's power endur'd; Whose wisdom brought his serpent craft to light, And stripp'd the holy-seeming hypocrite; Whose word resistless bade him “hence, begone,” Nor dare unblest usurp the one Almighty's throne: Saviour of men, I supplicate the aid, Which thee triumphant in the conflict made; That strong, and girded with thy Spirit's power, I may withstand temptation's dangerous hour, Beneath my feet the vanquish'd Tempter see, And serve my God alone, and worship Him in Thee! THE SUNDAY NEXT BEFORE EASTER. Free and mysterious are the ways of heaven! 'Tis man's to profit by God's bounty given; That bounty how to give, is God's own choice. Perchance his presence when we think to find Rapt in the fire, the earthquake, or the wind, Behold, we meet him in the still small voice. Creation's range the Maker Spirit fills, But deals his influence where and how he wills. “Why bathe in Jordan? wherefore should I lave My leprous limbs in Hebrew Jordan's wave? In vain do Abana and Pharphar roll? Do not Damascus' princely floods excel All the scant streams that water Israel? Why bathe me not in them, and so be whole? The seer methought would raise his potent hand, And sickness vanish at his high command.” Thus the proud tongue of Syrian Naaman, Unwont Jehovah's attributes to scan, The dictates of a wayward spirit pour'd: Till, by persuasive reason better taught, In God's own way the help of God he sought; He bathed in Jordan, and he rose restor'd. As fresh with health the tender infant glows, Pure from the wave the snow-white leper rose. So fares it with the sickness of the soul: Man from that leprosy would fain be whole; But life and healing come from One alone. He names the cure: but man mistrustful spurns The Saviour's heavenly medicine, and turns To other views, and reasonings of his own. Vain reasonings all, which aim to cast aside Celestial truth by dreams of human pride! “I know my Saviour suffer'd for my sake; I hope his promised grace: but why partake The needless rite of yon mysterious board? Enough; my feet each day of rest repair To seek his presence in his house of pray'r: Enough; his goodness in my heart is stor'd; And, conscience-led, that heart sincerely pays Its freewill meed of reasonable praise.” No, not enough, if more thy Lord demands. Hopest thou his grace? then seek it at his hands Beneath the hallow'd bread, the mystick wine: Him at the paschal feast reclining see, “Take this, and eat; drink this, and dwell with me; Behold my presence in my stated sign.” Trust not the grace, without the means, to share, But, where his word directs thee, seek him there. Own'st thou his love? What he injoins, obey. Pass from the paschal feast, and then survey Thy Saviour bleeding on the fatal tree: There mark his lips by silent death comprest, Which lately breath'd to thee his last request, “Do this, and this, in memory of me!” What less return than such memorial, say, Could love demand, can gratitude repay? Such be thy thoughts! then when the sacred priest Again shall bid thee to the heavenly feast, Pledge of thy health, and in thy Saviour's name; Turn, if thou canst, away! But ask thy heart, If thine the love, that speaks the Christian's part; If thine the faith, the Christian's grace may claim. No, turn not, turn not! take what God would give: Why wilt thou die, when he would have thee live? MONDAY BEFORE EASTER. Beyond the glen where Kedron flows, Where the dark olives' fruitful rows, Gethsemane, thy garden show; What form of sorrow meets my sight, All pallid as the pale moon-light, And full of meekness, as of woe? 'Tis He, sore bruised by misery's rod; The Son of man, the Son of God! The time shall come, ordain'd at length, When He, exulting in his strength, The winepress of his wrath shall tread; And o'er his robe, and o'er his vest, As from the crimson vintage prest, Shall blood of trampled foes be shed Isaiah lxiii. 3.. But prostrate now, and overthrown, The blood that stains Him is his own. From breast and limb, from brow and cheek, I see the sweat profusely break, And fall in big drops to the ground: And sure I not untruly deem, That mingled with that turbid stream His blood an undue course hath found. Well may his pores dilated bleed, Whose throes all other throes exceed. O Saviour, in this dreadful hour, When Hell puts forth his deadliest power, And floods of darkness o'er thee roll, And terror and amazement press, And, passing tongue of man, distress Weighs even unto death thy soul; What comfort doth thy spirit try, And whither for protection fly? I see thee kneel: I see thee fall Prone on the ground: I hear thee call, “My Father, O my Father, hear! If not against thy high decree, Me from this bitter trial free, Pass from my hand this cup of fear! Yet plead I humbly, as a son: O, not my will, but thine be done!” Once and again the pray'r is pray'd: And yet again paternal aid With fervour deep and deeper sought: And, lo! an angel from above, Charg'd with the ministry of love, Hath succour to the suppliant brought. The cup must to the dregs be quafft, But strength is given to bear the draught. O Saviour, such o'erwhelming woe 'Tis not for mortal man to know, Nor bloody sweat, like thine, to shed. But man to woe and grief is born; So when I faint with sorrow worn, And solace flies, and hope is dead; O, let me seek Gethsemane, And learn my remedy from thee: There learn before thy Father's throne With body bow'd, and lowly tone, To pour each sad distressful thought, With patient and obedient mind, With spirit earnest but resign'd, With filial love, that wearies not; With faith, that through yon cloudy skreen Sees Him by fleshly eyes unseen: So may He forth his angel send, (Such guides salvation's heirs attend,) Encamp'd a viewless guardian near; And in my draught of earthly ill Sweet drops of heavenly balm instil, And whisper to my mental ear: “Grudge not the Saviour's cross to bear; Who drink his cup, his crown shall wear.” TUESDAY BEFORE EASTER. When near his last afflicting hour The world's Redeemer drew, And the world's foe with hellish power His toils around him threw: Of those, who still had shar'd his bread, And still his love had tried, One recreant friend his Lord betray'd, And one his Lord denied. What lust the traitor's faith subdued? What deed his treason told? Lur'd by a bribe, his Saviour's blood The Apostate Judas sold. With kiss of peace, and honey'd tongue, Fair pledge of love and faith, About his Master's neck he hung, And gave him o'er to death. Confiding in himself alone, The strength of Peter failed: Thrice was he called his Lord to own, And thrice his courage quailed. Then for defence in deep dismay To oath and curse he ran; “Hence, with the groundless charge away, I do not know the man.” But, lo! the Lord's reproving look Recalls the warning word! Forth from the scene of shame he broke, And tears of anguish pour'd. Tears full of anguish keen he shed, But full of comfort too: Signs of a heart by fear misled, But not to love untrue. Nor fail'd remorse with conscious gloom To cloud the traitor's breast: He heard his blameless Master's doom, His own base deed confest; Away the price of blood he flung; But, no blest comfort tried, By fierce despair to madness stung, A foul self-murderer died. We seek not with presumptuous gaze To pierce beyond the tomb, Save as the word of truth displays The Apostate's fearful doom. But not in vain that word we deem To listening ears hath taught, “The place, might best his guilt beseem, His own sad place he sought.” O hapless Judas, slave of sin, Perdition's son forlorn, O well indeed thy lot had been, If thou had'st ne'er been born! O hadst thou mourn'd with Peter's grief, And tears like Peter pour'd, Such tears had brought thy soul relief, Such grief thy soul restor'd. O happy he, who lived to share The pardon'd spirit's rest, To feel and own his Master's care, And list his kind behest. Thrice charged the sheep of him to feed, Whose name he thrice denied, He followed where his Saviour led, And as his Saviour died. WEDNESDAY BEFORE EASTER. O, full it is of joy to see When brethren dwell in unity; And sweet it is, and passing sweet, To see when priests and people meet, As if with one consent they strove For rivalry in works of love, And the fair race of goodness ran To honour God and profit man. But full of sorrow is the sight, When they, who live in God's own light, With rival vigour onward press To win the prize of wickedness: And double sorrow 'tis, when they, Who ought to lead the heav'nward way, Their people turn aside, and aim, Priests with their flocks, at deeds of shame. Such deeds of shame, such sight of woe, City of God, 'twas thine to know, When all thy multitudes combin'd To crush the Saviour of mankind: And they, who sate in Moses' seat, And they who gathered round their feet, Leagued, to the death of slaves to bring The Son of God, their Israel's King. The poison with the chiefs began: There sit thy priests in dark divan, Intent to snare their harmless prey, With guile to snare, with malice slay: And now they count the price of blood; And now they join the ruthless crowd, Which round the patient sufferer pour'd, With torch and lantern, club and sword. And many a witness false they call, To flout him in their council hall: And fable many a tale of fear, To taint the jealous Roman's ear: The traitor's fate, they pass it by, Given o'er, his sin confess'd, to die; And, with persuasive devilish art, Steal mercy from the people's heart. Th' infection, through the people spread, Falsehood, and wrong, and malice bred; Rage, which preferr'd with clamorous strife Before their King's a murderer's life; The uproar loud; the savage cry, “Hence, crucify him, crucify!” And the deep curse's fearful load, Their own deep curse, a Saviour's blood. And sure it fell, that fearful curse, On thee and on thy race perverse, City of God! one ruin vast O'er tower and holy temple past. To slay the Saviour of mankind People and priest conspiring join'd; And priest and people long have rued The vengeance, which their guilt pursued. O hadst thou known, in that thy day, The path of peace that near thee lay! O hadst thou let thy Saviour fling Hen-like o'er thee his sheltering wing!— But vengeance on thy nation lies, And darkness still hath sealed their eyes; And, who shall stay Almighty fate? “Thy house is left thee desolate!” O dawn at length thy glorious day, When yon dark cloud shall pass away; When to thy courts thy sons shall press, And whom they pierc'd, their Lord confess: “Blest be the King of David's line! Blest be the King of birth divine! The world's delight! our Israel's pride! Hosanna to the Crucified!” THURSDAY BEFORE EASTER. They say, who Libya's sandy soil With lip of thirst, and feet of toil, And beating brow have paced, That scatter'd here and there are seen Some pleasant spots of cheerful green, Like isles in ocean's waste. There spring perennial fountains; there Delicious freshness cools the air, Soft dews, and breezes mild: While with broad leaf and nectarine fruit Trees of o'erarching palm salute The wanderer of the wild. By them, who scan with aching soul Of the world's acts the dreariest roll, So some fair spot is found, Where the pain'd thought may rest awhile; In that parch'd waste some fruitful isle, Diffusing freshness round. As o'er the page we mourn, which shews The dying Saviour's pangs and woes, His insults and his wrongs; Daughters of Israel, that the heart Breathes from its pain a little part, To you the praise belongs. When avarice sold, and fear denied, And envy, hate, and worldly pride, And rage with furious cry, Pursued the Saviour to his end; Nor friendship, save in one dear friend, Durst come the sufferer nigh: You traced his steps with loud lament, As bending with his cross he went Slow up the fatal hill; And, hanging on the accursed tree, His throne of pain and infamy, You watch'd and wept him still. Let flow your tears; let breathe your sighs; Cease not your sympathising cries: It soothes the drooping mind, A pilgrim in that weary waste, Such breeze of cooling air to taste, Such resting-place to find. It soothes to think, that mid the woes, Which round “the man of sorrows” close That thankless crowd among, He still might here and there espy The solace of some faithful eye, And hear some pitying tongue. Daughters of Israel! names belov'd! Of faith, more firm than men, approv'd; Of love, more warm and true! Though in that hour Apostles fail, We see your ceaseless zeal prevail, And with affection's welcome hail The Saviour's friends in you! Hail, bright ensamples of your kind!— Companion meet for man design'd, 'Tis woman's praise to prove, If his the bold adventurous deed, She more than shares with him the meed, For patient fortitude decreed, And deep enduring love. GOOD FRIDAY. “Ah! how far less I prize, sweet speech to hold With others, than to meditate on thee The allusion in this passage is to an inscription on an urn at the Leasowes on Miss Maria Dolman in the following words: “Heu! quanto minus est cum reliquis versari, quam tui meminisse!” very pleasing notice of it is taken by Mr. Rogers in his “Pleasures of Memory.”!” Thus o'er a daughter's urn affection told Her solace: thus beneath the fatal tree Faith greets the Saviour, counting all things loss Match'd with the untold riches of the Cross. How sweet the words, that win the Christian's ear, At intervals, from Jesus' parting breath; As if to render still more passing dear His love, his care, his agony, his death! That parting breath a holier influence showers, Than even his blameless life's divinest hours! “Father, forgive,” the King of sorrows said, As on the throne of that fell tree accurst Unfeeling men his feeble limbs outspread, And from his hands and feet the blood-streams burst: O, let not wrath the reckless deed pursue; “Father, forgive; they know not what they do!” Mid floods of scorn and hate that o'er him roll, Of answering tone no sounds vindictive start: But hark! what words of blessedness console The throbbings of one contrite sinner's heart, One faithful suppliant! “Thou this day shalt be, My word is truth, in paradise with me!” Yet once again from that opprobrious tree To soothe affliction breathe his accents bland; Where in dumb grief the mother lov'd, and he, His soul's delight, the lov'd disciple, stand: “One deed of filial love must yet be done: “Behold thy mother, thou! and thou, thy son!” But think not, while with lenient care he tried The grief, that pierced their inmost heart, to heal, 'Twas that he scorn'd, as if in stoick pride, His own heart's pangs and agonies to feel: How keen those pangs behoves not us to say, Well may his own distressful cry bewray. That cry distressful, “O my God, my God, Why leave me thus bereft of thee to mourn?” Full well we deem a bleeding heart it show'd, On the sharp rack of torture stretch'd and torn: But deem not that it savour'd of a heart, Estrang'd from patient suffering's duteous part. Devotion soothes to peace the mourner's soul: Sedate he scans with meditative eyes Of God's own book the long mysterious roll, And hark, “I thirst,” now near the goal he cries: “Behold, my Father, all thy counsel seal'd; And now my spirit to thy hands I yield.” Clos'd is the fatal scene! But Faith delights To Calvary's sad path and rocky hill On fancy's wing to speed her solemn flights, There take her stand, and hear and gaze her fill: Gaze on the traits of that despised face, And list to all those words of heavenly grace. There the meek pray'r of mercy on his foes, There to his friends affection's last bequest, The sovereign voice which paradise bestows, The spirit to his Father's care releas'd, Tell her that he, who thus his course hath run, Is the belov'd of God, his own dear Son. The darken'd sun, the earth's convulsive shock, The rending of the temple's holy veil, The opening sepulchres, the rifted rock, Take up the sequel of the wondrous tale: With one loud voice the truth proclaim abroad, And cry, “It is, it is, the Son of God.” EASTER EVEN. His day of pain and shame is past, His eve of rest is come: His death was with the wicked cast, But with the rich his tomb. He lies in yonder rock-hewn cave, Within yon massive stone: Swathed in the cearments of the grave, He slumbers there alone. Now, Israel's chiefs, your strife is o'er; Your vanquish'd thrall survey! But trust not rock, or massive door, Nor death and death's array. Add martial strength to priestly zeal, The tomb be faster barr'd: The stone with Judah's signet seal, With Rome's quaternions guard. What if by night his little flock, (For thus ye madly feign!) Should steal him from the cavern'd rock, And boast him ris'n again! Or what if he, whose sovereign will Long-buried Lazarus heard, Should by his own release fulfil His own prophetick word! That word, which mark'd him for the grave, No less his rising told: And think ye that corruption's cave God's Holy One shall hold? Then seal it well, that massive stone, And guard with sword and spear! But other watch, than earth can own, And other guards are near! As, when the prophet pray'd of old, His servant look'd abroad, And saw the hosts of God infold The mount and man of God 2 Kings vi. 16, 17.: Etherial forms their vigil keep Beside their Lord's sojourn; To tend him in his three-days' sleep, And herald his return. But host nor feat of arms there needs, His high behest to do: Alike by will or act it speeds, “By many or by few 1 Sam. xiv. 6..” One look shall quell that armed band, And wither all their soul; The touch of one resistless hand Away that stone shall roll; And hark! from that sepulchral bed Unearthly accents pour: “Why seek the living with the dead? He tarrieth here no more!” EASTER DAY. “Lo! the day, the Lord hath made!” From the tomb's funereal shade Now the Sun of goodness brings Healing on his radiant wings: And before his bridal light All the denizens of night, Fear and shame and sorrow fade. Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Angels, who the morn outrun To adore that glorious Sun; At whose step the firm earth shakes, From whose eye the lightning breaks, Ye whose hand excels in might, Ye whose accents breathe delight, Forms in dazzling white array'd, Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Holy women, whom the dawn Sees by pious duty drawn To the Saviour's rock-hewn bed, Tears and unguents rich to shed; Stay your tears, your gifts withhold: Angel-led the cave behold, Where the Saviour's corse was laid: Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Holy men, beloved pair, Who with rival speed repair To explore the inmost gloom Of the yet untrodden tomb: Mark the clothes, that wrapped him round, Swathed his limbs, his temples bound, All in seemliest order laid: Bless the day, the Lord hath made! First of all the faithful train To behold thy Lord again, Stay not, Mary, weeping here; See, thy Saviour's self is near: Quick thy mighty Master greet, Fall in homage at his feet; All thy griefs are now repaid: Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Doubtful hearts, whom late he taught, Musing now in anxious thought, Cease your doubts, your sorrows cease: Hear him speak the words of peace: Deem your eyes no spirit meet, Mark his pierced hands and feet, Mark his wounded side display'd; Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Church of God, whom this fair morn Sees to life and glory born, Founded on the living stone, Which by Judah's builders thrown, Thrown with infamy aside, Now becomes thy strength and pride: Be thy debt of duty paid, Bless the day, the Lord hath made! Ever as this day shall rise, Beaming in the vernal skies, Duly to the Saviour's praise, Church of God, the anthem raise. “Christ our passover was slain;” Keep the feast, and swell the strain: “Christ is raised from the dead;” Bless the day, the Lord hath made! MONDAY IN EASTER WEEK. There is a charm at eventide, Ere the great sun his radiance hide, Slow sinking in the west, To mark his beams all-golden throw O'er earth, sea, sky, a parting glow, The harbinger of rest. Such charm comes o'er the pensive mind, To see the Saviour of mankind Still fain to linger here; To linger yet a little while, And with kind look and farewell smile His drooping followers cheer. Past is the cloud that dimm'd his brow, And his own heav'n expects him now, His own bright realm of light; To claim his heritage above, The bosom of his Father's love, The right hand of his might. Go then! but goodness holds thee yet: Fain would'st thou still thy kingly state For those thou lov'st forego: Content a space on earth to stay, To chase the gloom of doubt away, And soothe the throbs of woe. She, who stands weeping there alone, With eyes that cleave to yonder stone, Must first behold thy face: The faithful friends, who wander near, Mute with amazement, wild with fear, Must first thy feet embrace. The mourners, slow of heart to learn;— Thy tongue must teach their heart to burn With Scripture's mystick lore: Who fled thee late, thy timorous train;— Thy form must bless their eyes again, Thy voice their peace restore. To him, whose anxious mind demands To feel thy feet, thy side, thy hands, Such boon thy grace must yield: To him, who thrice thy name denied, Thy charge, in kindness thrice applied, Must speak his pardon seal'd. Then go not yet! Though angel quires Have spread their wings, and strung their lyres, Thy soaring pomp to swell; Still linger here a little while, And gladden with thy parting smile The hearts, thou lov'st so well. O Thou, in might, in love, supreme! While heavenly glories round thee beam, Heir of thy Father's throne, The Eternal's co-eternal Word, Lord of the sceptre and the sword, Awe struck thy power we own. Nor less the charms, that through the veil Of dim humanity prevail, With deep affection view; The signs of goodness and of grace, That track thy course, delighted trace, And, what we love, pursue. TUESDAY IN EASTER WEEK. I saw a vision! Through a dreary vale Pass'd one of lowly semblance, weak and pale: Thick clouds and darkness o'er his passage hung, Thorns in his path his tender feet had wrung, His cup was grief, his food affliction's bread, It seem'd he had not where to lay his head; And, as unkindness' bitter sting he bore, Much was his body vex'd, his blameless spirit more. Thus as midway through that drear vale he went, A place I saw for sinners' punishment: Straight, yelling crowds the harmless pilgrim bind, To that sad place of guiltiness consign'd; Crown him with thorns, and bow the scornful knee, Strip, scourge, and nail him to a cursed tree, Then give him o'er to suffering and to shame, His limbs all marr'd with wounds, with blasphemy his name. Yet were there some, who, as he pass'd along, Heard with delight the dictates of his tongue; Mark'd what he did, and all his doings bless'd, With reverence tended, and with love caress'd; Poor though he were, obedient to his call To share his poverty forsook their all; Or to his wants, still following where he led, Of their world's substance gladly ministred. And some there were, who, when that ruthless crew To his last stage the patient victim drew, His steps with zeal that falter'd not pursued, And smote their bosoms as from far they view'd: And some who closer to that cursed tree Press'd with mute grief his sinking form to see, Caught the last words his parting spirit gave, And laid the lifeless corse with honour in the grave. I saw a vision! On a rainbow throne, Bright as a jasper or a sardine stone, Sate one of passing splendour, passing might; His crown was glory, and his robe was light: To swell his pomp were countless angels there, And countless men his high decree to share. Power flash'd in beams of radiance from his eye, And a dread name inscrib'd his vesture and his thigh. That name (I read it) told the owner's right, Supreme dominion, kingship infinite: That eye—no need was there of other fire To do his pleasure, and to wreak his ire. Thrill'd through and through his foes its sharpness felt, They sink: like wax before the flame they melt: “Shield us, ye hills,” I heard their panick call, “To save us from his wrath, on us, ye mountains, fall!” But were there none, who in that radiant eye Might other signs of fairer omen spy, And mark its rays of healing light declare The royal claim to pity and to spare? There were, there were: I see them bending meek Before that rainbow throne; I hear them speak With lifted hand, and supplicating tone Of faith and humble hope to Him who sits thereon: I hear the answer of a gracious voice, Which bids their hearts take comfort and rejoice: “Well was it done, that in my cause ye strove! Come, blessed children of my Father's love! For me ye suffer'd, and with me ye wept, My footsteps follow'd, and my sayings kept. Behold, a princely guerdon is your due: For you are thrones ordain'd, and crowns are wreath'd for you!” True are the visions, scorning fiction's aid, In sober characters of truth array'd. The portrait twofold, but the Person one, Who trod the valley, and who fill'd the throne. Turn the recording page of times gone by, And there portray'd “the man of grief” descry: Him, in the scroll of times to come enroll'd, The same “the King of Kings and Lord of Lords” behold! He thought not scorn, for man's distemper'd race The vale of tears, a pilgrim mean, to pace: He thought not robbery, to claim again By birth his own hereditary reign. Hear, when I call thee, Jesu, name ador'd! Son of the Father, universal Lord! Spare, spare thy suppliant, mildly speak his doom, My Saviour, God and man! my King, and Judge to come! THE ASCENSION-DAY. Why stand ye, men of Galilee, With upcast eyes intent to see Yon cloud of golden hue; Which higher still, and still more high, Ascending through the dark blue sky, As if it mock'd the straining eye, Still lessens to the view? Now soaring where nor eagle's flight Nor eagle's ken can bear, 'Tis vanish'd in the abyss of light, The unfathomable air. Rose in that cloud your God and Lord, The lov'd, the honour'd, the ador'd! Yet but a little space, With you he travers'd Kedron's flood, Here on this mount with you he stood, Ye trac'd his steps, his features view'd, And drank his words of grace. His hands, uprais'd to bless, ye saw; Ye heard his blessing given: Then mark'd him from this earth withdraw, And seek his own bright heaven. With other thoughts, than when ye met On this fair mount of Olivet Yon sad, yon fearful night, Now may your faithful bosoms glow: Then rul'd supreme the world's arch-foe; Then was the hour of dread, and woe, And treachery, and flight. But hell has lost his vaunted reign, And heavenly bliss succeeds: And he, who felt the galling chain, His captor captive leads. Why longer gaze? Ye deem perchance, As, when erewhile he burst the trance Which held his human frame, On earth his victory to tell, Cloth'd in the form ye knew so well, From the dark prison-house of hell The conquering Breaker Micah ii. 13. came; So will he now from heaven descend, And spread his power to save, And o'er the earth, to earth's far end, Judea's sceptre wave. And come he shall, but come not yet: At God's right hand his throne is set; Thence on each favour'd head Must first the eternal Spirit's power, In his regenerating hour, With rushing wind and fiery shower Of cloven tongues be shed: And many an age its course must hold, Or ere, the tale complete, His Church have filled her ample fold, His jubilee to greet. Then shall the gates, that now unfold Their valves of everlasting gold, Again their myriads pour; And, streams of fiery flame among, Thousands of chariots roll along, And thousand thousand angels throng His burning wheels before Dan. vii. 9, 10.; And He in cloudy canopy, As now, his brightness shroud; Descending with the Archangel's cry, And shout, and trump of God. Then turn ye, men of Galilee; Him, whom your eyes no longer see, With lips adoring own! On you his Spirit's power shall light: 'Tis yours through realms of sin and night To spread the Saviour's cross, and might, His triumph and his throne. And in refreshment's Acts iii. 19. promis'd day 'Tis yours your part to bear: To join his seraphim's array, Aloft his banner'd sign display, And in his glory share. WHITSUNDAY. “Come, let us raise on high A tower, may reach the sky, And o'er the earth establish our renown.” And so on Shinar's plain, The “mighty Hunter's” reign, Up sprang the tower of haughty Babylon. Tier above tier, and stage o'er stage it rose; And still with heavenward aim the giant fabrick grows. But God from heaven comes down, And with reproving frown Stays of the sons of men the proud career: Each from his fellow's tongue, Like bells at random rung, Nought save a jar of babbling sounds can hear; A maze of words, a wilderness of speech, Nor ear those sounds can scan, nor understanding reach. With varied speech and new Discordant fancies grew, Till He, who rul'd the world of right alone, His sovereign power defied, Saw other gods beside Advanc'd to unseat him from his heaven's high throne: Gods manifold from all creation's range, Strange rivals of their Maker, numberless as strange. He saw with jealous eye His own bright host on high, Cloth'd with the glory of the Eternal King: Nor less each nether birth Of water, air, and earth; Dead deities of man's imagining, Beast, fish, and winged fowl, and creeping worm, Whatever nature breeds, or fabling visions form. Nor wanted stone and stock The Lord of life to mock, As men in vaunted light through darkness rov'd; While, by just judgment blind, The undiscerning mind Sinn'd as it will'd, and what it sinn'd approv'd. Thus stain'd by lust, and prodigal of blood, The apostate world was plung'd in guilt's ingulphing flood. But now these times of night Have sped their destin'd flight: Through earth's bewilder'd nations far and wide Their long usurped seat Must the idol creatures quit, And the Creator's self be glorified: “Go, teach the nations,” said the incarnate Son, “And wash them in the name of Him, the Three in One.” But how the nations teach? Can Galilean speech With men of other lips acceptance find? In vain would God's own truth In phrase unknown, uncouth, Win through the listening ear the obedient mind. Who made the plague, must now the cure bestow: Who sends his legates forth, must give them skill to go. Hark, where together met The chosen twelve are set, A sound as of a rushing mighty wind! With that celestial sound The house is fill'd around, The circling air repeats it unconfin'd: And see, while every look is upward flung, Sits on each favour'd head a cloven fiery tongue. He comes, in that bright shower, The Godhead's promis'd Power: He comes, no strife of jarring tongues to spread; As when he came of yore On yon disastrous tower; But from the elements, which discord bred, To fix on earth the reign of truth and light, And in one note of praise all faithful hearts unite. He bids the lips unclose, He utteance bestows; And lo! amazement whelms the hearer's soul! From where Ulai's stream Glows with the orient beam, From the twin floods round Aram's plain that roll; From northern lands that skirt the Euxine wave, And those whose southern shore the Great Sea's waters lave; From Asia's sun-bright coast, Where, Greece, thy offspring boast The far-fam'd wonder of Diana's dome; From where Cyrene stands The pride of Libya's sands, Egyptian Memphis, and Italian Rome; From Crete's fair towns by meeting seas embrac'd, Judæa's stately towers, Arabia's tented waste; From every land and isle, Whereon the seasons smile, All who in Salem's honour'd courts appear, On God's high holyday Their first-fruit gifts to pay, Jew, Proselyte, with deep amazement hear, Each in his country's tongue proclaim'd abroad By Galilean lips the wondrous works of God. Now on, Christ's chosen band! Now give each peopled land Those wondrous works in all their tongues to learn! The plague of Babylon Is banish'd now and gone: Behold, the many-languaged nations turn From their dead vanities of stock and stone, To seek the living God, and worship him alone. From distant climes preferr'd So shall one pray'r be heard, Fruit of one faith, from one united flock; All brought alike to lave In one baptismal wave, All taught to drink from one enlivening rock: And one fair bond of brotherhood shall bind The families and tribes of long dispers'd mankind. So shall the enlighten'd sight A road to yonder height, Other than they of Shinar's plain descry: And men with holy dread The heavenward path shall tread, Which angels traverse between earth and sky; Forego Ambition's vaulting, and be fain By way of humbleness that steep ascent to gain. MONDAY IN WHITSUN WEEK. “Behold these Christians, how they live!” Such witness could the heathen give, When first the Church began To tread the course her Lord had trod, Intent to shew the love of God Fulfill'd in love of man. How goodly was the grace that fell On each true child of Israel, On every willing heart, While rivals each with each they strove, Brethren alike in faith and love, To act a brother's part. What though not theirs the influence shed On each apostle's gifted head, When couch'd in tongues of flame, Like sound of rushing wind that sweeps O'er Paran's waste the sandy heaps, The mighty Spirit came; Yet one and all 'twas theirs to know That mighty Spirit's genial glow, Which told their sins forgiven; Which wak'd them to a holy birth, Cleans'd from the dross and dregs of earth, And framed their souls for heaven. Soft came it, as the dewy shower, Unheard, unseen, at midnight hour, Which Hermon's heights distill: And pleasant as the limpid flow Of Siloa's waves, that softly go By Sion's holy hill: Pure as the snowy wreaths that crown The cedar crags of Lebanon; And copious as the flood, That o'er the banks of Jordan swell'd, And from their marshy haunts expell'd The tyrants of the wood: Refreshing as the vine that creeps O'er Carmel's grape-impurpled steeps, Fann'd by the sea-born gale; And fertile, as the pastur'd meads, His stream where ancient Kishon leads Through Esdraelon's vale: Sweet as the breath of Sharon's rose; And fair, as on Engaddi grows The tall and branching palm; And healthful, as the water clear Of Elim's wells, or amber tear From Gilead's shrubs of balm. Such grace was theirs: but not alone To them that genial grace was known: Still, as of old he wont, With those, who love their Saviour well, His Holy Spirit deigns to dwell; Still o'er the sacred font He broods with dove-like wings outspread; Enlivens still the hallow'd bread; Still in his house of pray'r His blessing to his priests imparts; And with obedient faithful hearts Still holds communion there. And oh! that all, his grace who need, Would woo him as his precepts lead; And still his presence prove, By holy hearts, and spirits meek, Thoughts that the good of others seek, And fellowship of love: So might hell's tyrant writhe with pain To see on earth his old domain New signs of Eden give; And angels, leaning from the sky, With rapture to the Saviour cry, “See how thy Christians live!” TUESDAY IN WHITSUN WEEK. Oft have I mark'd by storms defil'd The beauty of the azure skies: Above me clouds on clouds are pil'd; Beneath, around me, waste and wild A murky mass the ocean lies, Save where the whiten'd surges shew The boiling of the deep below. Anon a gleam of radiant light Piercing the sable gloom is seen: Brighter it grows, and still more bright; The opening clouds disperse in flight, The sea resumes his face serene: Lull'd to repose the billows cease, And all is pleasantness and peace. And such the peace and pleasantness Thy beams, O Comforter, impart: What time the storms of dark distress Hard on the wounded spirit press, And sorrow gathers round the heart, And nought appears to harbour there, But scenes of woe and black despair Then sent, blest Comforter, from thee Beams through the gloom a heavenly ray: Though scant at first and small to see, And faint perchance its dawning be, It brightens to a perfect day; Day such as once in Eden shone, Ere sin and sin-born care were known. Does conscience self-convicted grieve For guilt incurr'd and threatened woe? The wounds that bleed, the sighs that heave, 'Tis thine to soften and relieve, And hopes of fairer presage shew; Illumining with inward light “The dulness of the blinded sight.” 'Tis thine of godly grief to tell, Which fruits of deep repentance breeds; Of faith, whose eyes unerring dwell On him, who vanquish'd death and hell; Of love, still following where he leads; Of sinners, by his bruises heal'd; The ransom paid, the pardon seal'd. Do earthly troubles unallay'd Perplex, and earthly comforts fail? Has hope, deferr'd, deceiv'd, betray'd, On the lorn heart to sickness prey'd? Do friends forsake, and foes prevail? The restless frame does anguish try, Do those, who lov'd us, sink and die? Thou bidd'st from earthly objects mean To high and heavenly things aspire: Surpassing what on this terrene Or ear hath heard, or eye hath seen, Or thought can paint, or heart desire: Things, which no child of earth hath view'd, Unless by thee reviv'd, renew'd. O'erwhelm'd by care, desponding, weak, Who but would fain thy comfort find? Be his thy chastening gifts to seek: The holy heart; the spirit meek; The wish chastis'd; the will resign'd; The thoughts, that wing'd by faith arise, And hold communion with the skies. Be his, to life by thee restor'd, Thy healthful means of grace to share: Love's parting pledge, the mystick board; The treasures in thy volume stor'd; Thy preacher's voice; thy people's pray'r, Pour'd forth with congregated power; Nor less devotion's secret hour. To light and cheer him on the way Mid storms, his earthly path that shroud, These gifts disclose a heavenly ray: Till shine at length that perfect day, Unchang'd, perpetual, free from cloud Where sin and sin's effects shall cease, And all be purity and peace. TRINITY SUNDAY. O Holy, Holy, Holy, King supreme, Lord of the armies of the earth and sky, Before whose presence brightest Seraphim, As on thy throne thou sitt'st exalted high, Veil with o'ershadowing wings the dazzled eye: Thy praise the saints in heaven, a countless throng, Chant through thy temple with alternate cry: Thy praise the assembled saints on earth prolong, Foretaste of bliss to come, and join that heavenly song. O Holy, Holy, Holy! First to Thee, Father of all, the choral strains ascend: Thou art, thou wast, and thou for aye shalt be, Thou ne'er begannest, and thou ne'er shalt end: Great Source of being! Thou abroad didst send Thy mandate on creation's natal day: Life, light, and order thy behest attend; Chaos has heard, and darkness hastes away, And earth and heaven stand forth with all their fair array. O Holy, Holy, Holy! Next in state, The eternal Father's coeternal Son, We praise Thee, sole-begotten, uncreate: For thine the glory of the Father's throne, By birth inherited, by virtue won. Thou didst not scorn the lowly Virgin's womb, For us thy race of humbleness to run: Thou didst not spare, triumphant o'er the tomb, For us at God's right hand thy sceptre to resume. O Holy, Holy, Holy! Homage meet Thee too we pay, by thee, blest Spirit, led, Guide to all truth, all-knowing Paraclete! 'Twas thine at first with mighty wings outspread To brood above the waters dark and dead: O'er the baptismal waters still 'tis thine, Spirit of life, thy quickening power to shed: Where'er thou art, the charms of Eden shine, Peace, freedom, joy, and love, and sanctity divine. O Holy, Holy, Holy, One and Three, In person three, in essence still the same! Though darkly now, as in a glass, we see, And scan celestial things with partial aim; Taught by thy word, baptiz'd into thy name, 'Tis ours in lowliness of soul to own Of each, of all, the high mysterious claim; Till purg'd from mists by sin around us thrown, We see thee face to face, and know as we are known. O Holy, Holy, Holy, King supreme, Lord of the armies of the earth and sky; As thou my first, be thou my latest theme, To thee with praise, on thee for grace I cry: Thou all in all, a thing of nought am I! Led by the light of thy unerring lore To thee I turn with faith's illumin'd eye, No further seek thy secrets to explore, But bow me to the dust, and wonder, and adore!</field>
