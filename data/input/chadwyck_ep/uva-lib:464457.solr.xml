Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. FRAGMENT A. Many men seyn that in sweveninges Ther nis but fables and lesinges; But men may somme swevenes seen, Which hardely ne false been, But afterward ben apparaunte. This may I drawe to waraunte An authour, that hight Macrobes, That halt not dremes false ne lees, But undoth us the avisioun That whylom mette king Cipioun. And who-so sayth, or weneth it be A Iape, or elles [a] nycetee To wene that dremes after falle, Let who-so liste a fool me calle. For this trowe I, and say for me, That dremes signifiaunce be Of good and harme to many wightes, That dremen in her slepe a-nightes Ful many thinges covertly, That fallen after al openly. Within my twenty yere of age, Whan that Love taketh his corage Of yonge folk, I wente sone To bedde, as I was wont to done, And fast I sleep; and in sleping, Me mette swiche a swevening, That lykede me wonders wel; But in that sweven is never a del That it nis afterward befalle, Right as this dreem wol telle us alle. Now this dreem wol I ryme aright, To make your hertes gaye and light; For Love it prayeth, and also Commaundeth me that it be so. And if ther any aske me, Whether that it be he or she, How [that] this book [the] which is here Shal hote, that I rede you here; It is the Romance of the Rose, In which al the art of love I close. The mater fair is of to make; God graunte in gree that she it take For whom that it begonnen is! And that is she that hath, y-wis, So mochel prys; and ther-to she So worthy is biloved be, That she wel oughte of prys and right, Be cleped Rose of every wight. That it was May me thoughte tho, It is fyve yere or more ago; That it was May, thus dremed me, In tyme of love and Iolitee, That al thing ginneth waxen gay, For ther is neither busk nor hay In May, that it nil shrouded been, And it with newe leves wreen. These wodes eek recoveren grene, That drye in winter been to sene; And the erthe wexeth proud withalle, For swote dewes that on it falle, And [al] the pore estat forget In which that winter hadde it set, And than bicometh the ground so proud That it wol have a newe shroud, And maketh so queynt his robe and fayr That it hath hewes an hundred payr Of gras and floures, inde and pers, And many hewes ful dyvers: That is the robe I mene, y-wis, Through which the ground to preisen is. The briddes, that han left hir song, Whyl they han suffred cold so strong In wedres grille, and derk to sighte, Ben in May, for the sonne brighte, So glade, that they shewe in singing, That in hir herte is swich lyking, That they mote singen and be light. Than doth the nightingale hir might To make noyse, and singen blythe. Than is blisful, many a sythe, The chelaundre and the papingay. Than yonge folk entenden ay For to ben gay and amorous, The tyme is than so savorous. Hard is his herte that loveth nought In May, whan al this mirth is wrought; Whan he may on these braunches here The smale briddes singen clere Hir blisful swete song pitous; And in this sesoun delytous, Whan love affrayeth alle thing, Me thoughte a-night, in my sleping, Right in my bed, ful redily, That it was by the morowe erly, And up I roos, and gan me clothe; Anoon I wissh myn hondes bothe; A sylvre nedle forth I drogh Out of an aguiler queynt y-nogh, And gan this nedle threde anon; For out of toun me list to gon The sowne of briddes for to here, That on thise busshes singen clere. And in the swete sesoun that leef is, With a threde basting my slevis, Aloon I wente in my playing, The smale foules song harkning; That peyned hem ful many a payre To singe on bowes blosmed fayre. Iolif and gay, ful of gladnesse, Toward a river I gan me dresse, That I herde renne faste by; For fairer playing non saugh I Than playen me by that riveer, For from an hille that stood ther neer, Cam doun the streem ful stif and bold. Cleer was the water, and as cold As any welle is, sooth to seyne; And somdel lasse it was than Seine, But it was straighter wel away. And never saugh I, er that day, The water that so wel lyked me; And wonder glad was I to see That lusty place, and that riveer; And with that water that ran so cleer My face I wissh. Tho saugh I wel The botme paved everydel With gravel, ful of stones shene. The medewe softe, swote, and grene, Beet right on the water-syde. Ful cleer was than the morow-tyde, And ful attempre, out of drede. Tho gan I walke through the mede, Dounward ay in my pleying, The river-syde costeying. And whan I had a whyle goon, I saugh a Gardin right anoon, Ful long and brood, and everydel Enclos it was, and walled wel, With hye walles enbatailled, Portrayed without, and wel entailled With many riche portraitures; And bothe images and peyntures Gan I biholde bisily. And I wol telle you, redily, Of thilke images the semblaunce, As fer as I have remembraunce. A-midde saugh I Hate stonde, That for hir wrathe, ire, and onde, Semed to been a moveresse, An angry wight, a chideresse; And ful of gyle, and fel corage, By semblaunt was that ilke image. And she was no-thing wel arrayed, But lyk a wood womman afrayed; Y-frounced foule was hir visage, And grenning for dispitous rage; Hir nose snorted up for tene. Ful hidous was she for to sene, Ful foul and rusty was she, this. Hir heed y-writhen was, y-wis, Ful grimly with a greet towayle. An image of another entayle, A lift half, was hir faste by; Hir name above hir heed saugh I, And she was called Felonye. Another image, that Vilanye Y-cleped was, saugh I and fond Upon the walle on hir right hond. Vilanye was lyk somdel That other image; and, trusteth wel, She semed a wikked creature. By countenaunce, in portrayture, She semed be ful despitous, And eek ful proud and outrageous. Wel coude he peynte, I undertake, That swiche image coude make. Ful foul and cherlish semed she, And eek vilaynous for to be, And litel coude of norture, To worshipe any creature. And next was peynted Coveityse, That eggeth folk, in many gyse, To take and yeve right nought ageyn, And grete tresours up to leyn. And that is she that for usure Leneth to many a creature The lasse for the more winning, So coveitous is her brenning. And that is she, for penyes fele, That techeth for to robbe and stele These theves, and these smale harlotes; And that is routhe, for by hir throtes Ful many oon hangeth at the laste. She maketh folk compasse and caste To taken other folkes thing, Through robberie, or miscounting. And that is she that maketh trechoures; And she [that] maketh false pledoures, That with hir termes and hir domes Doon maydens, children, and eek gromes Hir heritage to forgo. Ful croked were hir hondes two; For Coveityse is ever wood To grypen other folkes good. Coveityse, for hir winning, Ful leef hath other mennes thing. Another image set saugh I Next Coveityse faste by, And she was cleped Avarice. Ful foul in peynting was that vice; Ful sad and caytif was she eek, And al-so grene as any leek. So yvel hewed was hir colour, Hir semed have lived in langour. She was lyk thing for hungre deed, That ladde hir lyf only by breed Kneden with eisel strong and egre; And therto she was lene and megre. And she was clad ful povrely, Al in an old torn courtepy, As she were al with dogges torn; And bothe bihinde and eek biforn Clouted was she beggarly. A mantel heng hir faste by, Upon a perche, weyke and smalle; A burnet cote heng therwithalle, Furred with no menivere, But with a furre rough of here, Of lambe-skinnes hevy and blake; It was ful old, I undertake. For Avarice to clothe hir wel Ne hasteth hir, never a del; For certeynly it were hir loth To weren ofte that ilke cloth; And if it were forwered, she Wolde have ful greet necessitee Of clothing, er she boughte hir newe, Al were it bad of wolle and hewe. This Avarice held in hir hande A purs, that heng [doun] by a bande; And that she hidde and bond so stronge, Men must abyde wonder longe Out of that purs er ther come ought, For that ne cometh not in hir thought; It was not, certein, hir entente That fro that purs a peny wente. And by that image, nygh y-nough, Was peynt Envye, that never lough, Nor never wel in herte ferde But-if she outher saugh or herde Som greet mischaunce, or greet disese. No-thing may so moch hir plese As mischef and misaventure; Or whan she seeth discomfiture Upon any worthy man falle, Than lyketh hir [ful] wel withalle. She is ful glad in hir corage, If she see any greet linage Be brought to nought in shamful wyse. And if a man in honour ryse, Or by his witte, or by prowesse, Of that hath she gret hevinesse; For, trusteth wel, she goth nigh wood Whan any chaunce happeth good. Envye is of swich crueltee, That feith ne trouthe holdeth she To freend ne felawe, bad or good. Ne she hath kin noon of hir blood, That she nis ful hir enemy; She nolde, I dar seyn hardely, Hir owne fader ferde wel. And sore abyeth she everydel Hir malice, and hir maltalent: For she is in so greet turment And hath such [wo], whan folk doth good, That nigh she melteth for pure wood; Hir herte kerveth and to-breketh That god the peple wel awreketh. Envye, y-wis, shal never lette Som blame upon the folk to sette. I trowe that if Envye, y-wis, Knewe the beste man that is On this syde or biyond the see, Yit somwhat lakken him wolde she. And if he were so hende and wys, That she ne mighte al abate his prys, Yit wolde she blame his worthinesse, Or by hir wordes make it lesse. I saugh Envye, in that peynting, Hadde a wonderful loking; For she ne loked but awry, Or overthwart, al baggingly. And she hadde [eek] a foul usage; She mighte loke in no visage Of man or womman forth-right pleyn, But shette oon yë for disdeyn; So for envye brenned she Whan she mighte any man [y]-see, That fair, or worthy were, or wys, Or elles stood in folkes prys. Sorowe was peynted next Envye Upon that walle of masonrye. But wel was seen in hir colour That she hadde lived in langour; Hir semed have the Iaunyce. Nought half so pale was Avaryce, Nor no-thing lyk, [as] of lenesse; For sorowe, thought, and greet distresse, That she hadde suffred day and night Made hir ful yelwe, and no-thing bright, Ful fade, pale, and megre also. Was never wight yit half so wo As that hir semed for to be, Nor so fulfilled of ire as she. I trowe that no wight mighte hir plese, Nor do that thing that mighte hir ese; Nor she ne wolde hir sorowe slake, Nor comfort noon unto hir take; So depe was hir wo bigonnen, And eek hir herte in angre ronnen, A sorowful thing wel semed she. Nor she hadde no-thing slowe be For to forcracchen al hir face, And for to rende in many place Hir clothes, and for to tere hir swire, As she that was fulfilled of ire; And al to-torn lay eek hir here Aboute hir shuldres, here and there, As she that hadde it al to-rent For angre and for maltalent. And eek I telle you certeynly How that she weep ful tenderly. In world nis wight so hard of herte That hadde seen hir sorowes smerte, That nolde have had of hir pitee, So wo-bigoon a thing was she. She al to-dasshte hir-self for wo, And smoot togider her handes two. To sorwe was she ful ententyf, That woful recchelees caityf; Hir roughte litel of pleying, Or of clipping or [of] kissing; For who-so sorweful is in herte Him liste not to pleye ne sterte, Nor for to daunsen, ne to singe, Ne may his herte in temper bringe To make Ioye on even or morowe; For Ioye is contraire unto sorowe. Elde was peynted after this, That shorter was a foot, ywis, Than she was wont in her yonghede. Unnethe hir-self she mighte fede; So feble and eek so old was she That faded was al hir beautee. Ful salowe was waxen hir colour, Hir heed for-hoor was, whyt as flour. Y-wis, gret qualm ne were it noon, Ne sinne, although hir lyf were gon. Al woxen was hir body unwelde, And drye, and dwyned al for elde. A foul forwelked thing was she That whylom round and softe had be. Hir eres shoken fast withalle, As from her heed they wolde falle. Hir face frounced and forpyned, And bothe hir hondes lorn, fordwyned. So old she was that she ne wente A foot, but it were by potente. The Tyme, that passeth night and day, And restelees travayleth ay, And steleth from us so prively, That to us seemeth sikerly That it in oon point dwelleth ever, And certes, it ne resteth never, But goth so faste, and passeth ay, That ther nis man that thinke may What tyme that now present is: Asketh at these clerkes this; For [er] men thinke it redily, Three tymes been y-passed by. The tyme, that may not soiourne, But goth, and never may retourne, As water that doun renneth ay, But never drope retourne may; Ther may no-thing as tyme endure, Metal, nor erthely creature; For alle thing it fret and shal: The tyme eek, that chaungeth al, And al doth waxe and festred be, And alle thing distroyeth he: The tyme, that eldeth our auncessours And eldeth kinges and emperours, And that us alle shal overcomen Er that deeth us shal have nomen: The tyme, that hath al in welde To elden folk, had maad hir elde So inly, that, to my witing, She mighte helpe hir-self no-thing, But turned ageyn unto childhede; She had no-thing hir-self to lede, Ne wit ne pith in[with] hir holde More than a child of two yeer olde. But natheles, I trowe that she Was fair sumtyme, and fresh to see, Whan she was in hir rightful age: But she was past al that passage And was a doted thing bicomen. A furred cope on had she nomen; Wel had she clad hir-self and warm, For cold mighte elles doon hir harm. These olde folk have alwey colde, Hir kinde is swiche, whan they ben olde. Another thing was doon ther write, That semede lyk an ipocrite, And it was cleped Pope-holy. That ilke is she that prively Ne spareth never a wikked dede, Whan men of hir taken non hede; And maketh hir outward precious, With pale visage and pitous, And semeth a simple creature; But ther nis no misaventure That she ne thenketh in hir corage. Ful lyk to hir was that image, That maked was lyk hir semblaunce. She was ful simple of countenaunce, And she was clothed and eek shod, As she were, for the love of god, Yolden to religioun, Swich semed hir devocioun. A sauter held she faste in honde, And bisily she gan to fonde To make many a feynt prayere To god, and to his seyntes dere. Ne she was gay, fresh, ne Iolyf, But semed be ful ententyf To gode werkes, and to faire And therto she had on an haire. Ne certes, she was fat no-thing, But semed wery for fasting; Of colour pale and deed was she. From hir the gate [shal] werned be Of paradys, that blisful place; For swich folk maketh lene hir face, As Crist seith in his evangyle, To gete hem prys in toun a whyle; And for a litel glorie veine They lesen god and eek his reine. And alderlast of everichoon, Was peynted Povert al aloon, That not a peny hadde in wolde, Al-though [that] she hir clothes solde, And though she shulde anhonged be; For naked as a worm was she. And if the weder stormy were, For colde she shulde have deyed there. She nadde on but a streit old sak, And many a clout on it ther stak; This was hir cote and hir mantel, No more was there, never a del, To clothe her with; I undertake, Gret leyser hadde she to quake. And she was put, that I of talke, Fer fro these other, up in an halke; There lurked and there coured she, For povre thing, wher-so it be, Is shamfast, and despysed ay. Acursed may wel be that day, That povre man conceyved is; For god wot, al to selde, y-wis, Is any povre man wel fed, Or wel arayed or y-cled, Or wel biloved, in swich wyse In honour that he may aryse. Alle these thinges, wel avysed, As I have you er this devysed, With gold and asure over alle Depeynted were upon the walle. Squar was the wal, and high somdel; Enclosed, and y-barred wel, In stede of hegge, was that gardin; Com never shepherde therin. Into that gardyn, wel [y-]wrought, Who-so that me coude have brought, By laddre, or elles by degree, It wolde wel have lyked me. For swich solace, swich Ioye, and play, I trowe that never man ne say, As in that place delitous. The gardin was not daungerous To herberwe briddes many oon. So riche a yerd was never noon Of briddes songe, and braunches grene. Therin were briddes mo, I wene, Than been in alle the rewme of Fraunce. Ful blisful was the accordaunce Of swete and pitous songe they made, For al this world it oughte glade. And I my-self so mery ferde, Whan I hir blisful songes herde, That for an hundred pound nolde I,— If that the passage openly Hadde been unto me free— That I nolde entren for to see Thassemblee, god [it kepe and were!]— Of briddes, whiche therinne were, That songen, through hir mery throtes, Daunces of love, and mery notes. Whan I thus herde foules singe, I fel faste in a weymentinge, By which art, or by what engyn I mighte come in that gardyn; But way I couthe finde noon Into that gardin for to goon. Ne nought wiste I if that ther were Eyther hole or place [o]-where, By which I mighte have entree; Ne ther was noon to teche me; For I was al aloon, y-wis, Ful wo and anguissous of this. Til atte laste bithoughte I me, That by no weye ne mighte it be; That ther nas laddre or wey to passe, Or hole, into so fair a place. Tho gan I go a ful gret pas Envyroning even in compas The closing of the square wal, Til that I fond a wiket smal So shet, that I ne mighte in goon, And other entree was ther noon. Upon this dore I gan to smyte, That was [so] fetys and so lyte; For other wey coude I not seke. Ful long I shoof, and knokked eke, And stood ful long and of[t] herkning If that I herde a wight coming; Til that the dore of thilke entree A mayden curteys opened me. Hir heer was as yelowe of hewe As any basin scoured newe. Hir flesh [as] tendre as is a chike, With bente browes, smothe and slike; And by mesure large were The opening of hir yën clere. Hir nose of good proporcioun, Hir yën greye as a faucoun, With swete breeth and wel savoured. Hir face whyt and wel coloured, With litel mouth, and round to see; A clove chin eek hadde she. Hir nekke was of good fasoun In lengthe and gretnesse, by resoun, Withoute bleyne, scabbe, or royne. Fro Ierusalem unto Burgoyne Ther nis a fairer nekke, y-wis, To fele how smothe and softe it is. Hir throte, al-so whyt of hewe As snow on braunche snowed newe. Of body ful wel wrought was she Men neded not, in no cuntree, A fairer body for to seke. And of fyn orfrays had she eke A chapelet: so semly oon Ne wered never mayde upon; . . . . And faire above that chapelet A rose gerland had she set. She hadde [in honde] a gay mirour, And with a riche gold tressour Hir heed was tressed queyntely; Hir sleves sewed fetisly. And for to kepe hir hondes faire Of gloves whyte she hadde a paire. And she hadde on a cote of grene Of cloth of Gaunt; withouten wene, Wel semed by hir apparayle She was not wont to greet travayle. For whan she kempt was fetisly, And wel arayed and richely, Thanne had she doon al hir Iournee; For mery and wel bigoon was she. She ladde a lusty lyf in May, She hadde no thought, by night ne day, Of no-thing, but it were oonly To graythe hir wel and uncouthly. Whan that this dore hadde opened me This mayden, semely for to see, I thanked hir as I best mighte, And axede hir how that she highte, And what she was, I axede eke. And she to me was nought unmeke, Ne of hir answer daungerous, But faire answerde, and seide thus:— ‘Lo, sir, my name is Ydelnesse; So clepe men me, more and lesse. Ful mighty and ful riche am I, And that of oon thing, namely; For I entende to no-thing But to my Ioye, and my pleying, And for to kembe and tresse me. Aqueynted am I, and privee With Mirthe, lord of this gardyn, That fro the lande of Alexandryn Made the trees be hider fet, That in this gardin been y-set. And whan the trees were woxen on highte, This wal, that stant here in thy sighte, Dide Mirthe enclosen al aboute; And these images, al withoute, He dide hem bothe entaile and peynte, That neither ben Iolyf ne queynte, But they ben ful of sorowe and wo, As thou hast seen a whyle ago. ‘And ofte tyme, him to solace, Sir Mirthe cometh into this place, And eek with him cometh his meynee, That liven in lust and Iolitee. And now is Mirthe therin, to here The briddes, how they singen clere, The mavis and the nightingale, And other Ioly briddes smale. And thus he walketh to solace Him and his folk; for swetter place To pleyen in he may not finde, Although he soughte oon in-til Inde. The alther-fairest folk to see That in this world may founde be Hath Mirthe with him in his route, That folowen him alwayes aboute.’ When Ydelnesse had told al this, And I hadde herkned wel, y-wis, Than seide I to dame Ydelnesse, ‘Now al-so wisly god me blesse, Sith Mirthe, that is so fair and free, Is in this yerde with his meynee, Fro thilke assemblee, if I may, Shal no man werne me to-day, That I this night ne mote it see. For, wel wene I, ther with him be A fair and Ioly companye Fulfilled of alle curtesye.’ And forth, withoute wordes mo, In at the wiket wente I tho, That Ydelnesse hadde opened me, Into that gardin fair to see. And whan I was [ther]in, y-wis, Myn herte was ful glad of this. For wel wende I ful sikerly Have been in paradys erth[e]ly; So fair it was, that, trusteth wel, It semed a place espirituel. For certes, as at my devys, Ther is no place in paradys So good in for to dwelle or be As in that Gardin, thoughte me; For there was many a brid singing, Throughout the yerde al thringing. In many places were nightingales, Alpes, finches, and wodewales, That in her swete song delyten In thilke place as they habyten. Ther mighte men see many flokkes Of turtles and [of] laverokkes. Chalaundres fele saw I there, That wery, nigh forsongen were. And thrustles, terins, and mavys, That songen for to winne hem prys, And eek to sormounte in hir song These other briddes hem among. By note made fair servyse These briddes, that I you devyse; They songe hir song as faire and wel As angels doon espirituel. And, trusteth wel, whan I hem herde, Full lustily and wel I ferde; For never yit swich melodye Was herd of man that mighte dye. Swich swete song was hem among, That me thoughte it no briddes song, But it was wonder lyk to be Song of mermaydens of the see; That, for her singing is so clere, Though we mermaydens clepe hem here In English, as in our usaunce, Men clepen hem sereyns in Fraunce. Ententif weren for to singe These briddes, that nought unkunninge Were of hir craft, and apprentys, But of [hir] song sotyl and wys. And certes, whan I herde hir song, And saw the grene place among, In herte I wex so wonder gay, That I was never erst, er that day, So Iolyf, nor so wel bigo, Ne mery in herte, as I was tho. And than wiste I, and saw ful wel, That Ydelnesse me served wel, That me putte in swich Iolitee. Hir freend wel oughte I for to be, Sith she the dore of that gardyn Hadde opened, and me leten in. From hennesforth how that I wroughte, I shal you tellen, as me thoughte. First, whereof Mirthe served there, And eek what folk ther with him were, Without fable I wol descryve. And of that gardin eek as blyve I wol you tellen after this. The faire fasoun al, y-wis, That wel [y-]wrought was for the nones, I may not telle you al at ones: But as I may and can, I shal By ordre tellen you it al. Ful fair servyse and eek ful swete These briddes maden as they sete. Layes of love, ful wel sowning They songen in hir Iargoning; Summe highe and summe eek lowe songe Upon the braunches grene y-spronge. The sweetnesse of hir melodye Made al myn herte in reverdye. And whan that I hadde herd, I trowe, These briddes singing on a rowe, Than mighte I not withholde me That I ne wente in for to see Sir Mirthe; for my desiring Was him to seen, over alle thing, His countenaunce and his manere: That sighte was to me ful dere. Tho wente I forth on my right hond Doun by a litel path I fond Of mentes ful, and fenel grene; And faste by, withoute wene, Sir Mirthe I fond; and right anoon Unto sir Mirthe gan I goon, Ther-as he was, him to solace. And with him, in that lusty place, So fair folk and so fresh hadde he, That whan I saw, I wondred me Fro whennes swich folk mighte come, So faire they weren, alle and some; For they were lyk, as to my sighte, To angels, that ben fethered brighte. This folk, of which I telle you so, Upon a carole wenten tho. A lady caroled hem, that highte Gladnes, [the] blisful and the lighte; Wel coude she singe and lustily, Non half so wel and semely, And make in song swich refreininge, It sat hir wonder wel to singe. Hir vois ful cleer was and ful swete. She was nought rude ne unmete, But couthe y-now of swich doing As longeth unto caroling: For she was wont in every place To singen first, folk to solace; For singing most she gaf hir to; No craft had she so leef to do. Tho mightest thou caroles seen, And folk [ther] daunce and mery been, And make many a fair tourning Upon the grene gras springing. Ther mightest thou see these floutours, Minstrales, and eek Iogelours, That wel to singe dide hir peyne. Somme songe songes of Loreyne; For in Loreyne hir notes be Ful swetter than in this contree. Ther was many a timbestere, And saylours, that I dar wel swere Couthe hir craft ful parfitly. The timbres up ful sotilly They caste, and henten [hem] ful ofte Upon a finger faire and softe, That they [ne] fayled never-mo. Ful fetis damiselles two, Right yonge, and fulle of semlihede, In kirtles, and non other wede, And faire tressed every tresse, Hadde Mirthe doon, for his noblesse, Amidde the carole for to daunce; But her-of lyth no remembraunce, How that they daunced queyntely. That oon wolde come al prively Agayn that other: and whan they were Togidre almost, they threwe y-fere Hir mouthes so, that through hir play It semed as they kiste alway; To dauncen wel coude they the gyse; What shulde I more to you devyse? Ne bede I never thennes go, Whyles that I saw hem daunce so. Upon the carole wonder faste, I gan biholde; til atte laste A lady gan me for to espye, And she was cleped Curtesye, The worshipful, the debonaire; I pray god ever falle hir faire! Ful curteisly she called me, ‘What do ye there, beau sire?’ quod she, ‘Come [neer], and if it lyke yow To dauncen, daunceth with us now.’ And I, withoute tarying, Wente into the caroling. I was abasshed never a del, But it me lykede right wel, That Curtesye me cleped so, And bad me on the daunce go. For if I hadde durst, certeyn I wolde have caroled right fayn, As man that was to daunce blythe. Than gan I loken ofte sythe The shap, the bodies, and the cheres, The countenaunce and the maneres Of alle the folk that daunced there, And I shal telle what they were. Ful fair was Mirthe, ful long and high; A fairer man I never sigh. As round as appel was his face, Ful rody and whyt in every place. Fetys he was and wel beseye, With metely mouth and yën greye; His nose by mesure wrought ful right; Crisp was his heer, and eek ful bright. His shuldres of a large brede, And smalish in the girdilstede. He semed lyk a portreiture, So noble he was of his stature, So fair, so Ioly, and so fetys, With limes wrought at poynt devys, Deliver, smert, and of gret might; Ne sawe thou never man so light. Of berde unnethe hadde he no-thing, For it was in the firste spring. Ful yong he was, and mery of thought, And in samyt, with briddes wrought, And with gold beten fetisly, His body was clad ful richely. Wrought was his robe in straunge gyse, And al to-slitered for queyntyse In many a place, lowe and hye. And shod he was with greet maistrye, With shoon decoped, and with laas. By druerye, and by solas, His leef a rosen chapelet Had maad, and on his heed it set. And wite ye who was his leef? Dame Gladnes ther was him so leef, That singeth so wel with glad corage, That from she was twelve yeer of age, She of hir love graunt him made. Sir Mirthe hir by the finger hadde [In] daunsing, and she him also; Gret love was atwixe hem two. Bothe were they faire and brighte of hewe; She semede lyk a rose newe Of colour, and hir flesh so tendre, That with a brere smale and slendre Men mighte it cleve, I dar wel sayn. Hir forheed, frounceles al playn. Bente were hir browes two, Hir yën greye, and gladde also, That laughede ay in hir semblaunt, First or the mouth, by covenaunt. I not what of hir nose descryve; So fair hath no womman alyve. . . . Hir heer was yelowe, and cleer shyning, I wot no lady so lyking. Of orfrays fresh was hir gerland; I, whiche seen have a thousand, Saugh never, y-wis, no gerlond yit, So wel [y]-wrought of silk as it. And in an over-gilt samyt Clad she was, by gret delyt, Of which hir leef a robe werde, The myrier she in herte ferde. And next hir wente, on hir other syde, The god of Love, that can devyde Love, as him lyketh it [to] be. But he can cherles daunten, he, And maken folkes pryde fallen. And he can wel these lordes thrallen, And ladies putte at lowe degree, Whan he may hem to proude see. This God of Love of his fasoun Was lyk no knave, ne quistroun; His beautee gretly was to pryse. But of his robe to devyse I drede encombred for to be. For nought y-clad in silk was he, But al in floures and flourettes, Y-painted al with amorettes; And with losenges and scochouns, With briddes, libardes, and lyouns, And other beestes wrought ful wel. His garnement was everydel Y-portreyd and y-wrought with floures, By dyvers medling of coloures. Floures ther were of many gyse Y-set by compas in assyse; Ther lakked no flour, to my dome, Ne nought so muche as flour of brome, Ne violete, ne eek pervenke, Ne flour non, that man can on thenke, And many a rose-leef ful long Was entermedled ther-among: And also on his heed was set Of roses rede a chapelet. But nightingales, a ful gret route, That flyen over his heed aboute, The leves felden as they flyen; And he was al with briddes wryen, With popiniay, with nightingale, With chalaundre, and with wodewale, With finch, with lark, and with archaungel. He semede as he were an aungel That doun were comen fro hevene clere. Love hadde with him a bachelere, That he made alweyes with him be; Swete-Loking cleped was he. This bachelere stood biholding The daunce, and in his honde holding Turke bowes two hadde he. That oon of hem was of a tree That bereth a fruyt of savour wikke; Ful croked was that foule stikke, And knotty here and there also, And blak as bery, or any slo. That other bowe was of a plante Withoute wem, I dar warante, Ful even, and by proporcioun Tretys and long, of good fasoun. And it was peynted wel and thwiten, And over-al diapred and writen With ladies and with bacheleres, Ful lightsom and [ful] glad of cheres. These bowes two held Swete-Loking, That semed lyk no gadeling. And ten brode arowes held he there, Of which five in his right hond were. But they were shaven wel and dight, Nokked and fethered a-right; And al they were with gold bigoon, And stronge poynted everichoon, And sharpe for to kerven weel. But iren was ther noon ne steel; For al was gold, men mighte it see, Out-take the fetheres and the tree. The swiftest of these arowes fyve Out of a bowe for to dryve, And best [y]-fethered for to flee, And fairest eek, was cleped Beautee. That other arowe, that hurteth lesse, Was cleped, as I trowe, Simplesse. The thridde cleped was Fraunchyse, That fethered was, in noble wyse, With valour and with curtesye. The fourthe was cleped Companye, That hevy for to sheten is; But who-so sheteth right, y-wis, May therwith doon gret harm and wo. The fifte of these, and laste also, Fair-Semblaunt men that arowe calle, The leeste grevous of hem alle; Yit can it make a ful gret wounde, But he may hope his sores sounde, That hurt is with that arowe, y-wis; His wo the bet bistowed is. For he may soner have gladnesse, His langour oughte be the lesse. Fyve arowes were of other gyse, That been ful foule to devyse; For shaft and ende, sooth to telle, Were al-so blak as feend in helle. The first of hem is called Pryde; That other arowe next him bisyde, It was [y]-cleped Vilanye; That arowe was as with felonye Envenimed, and with spitous blame. The thridde of hem was cleped Shame. The fourthe, Wanhope cleped is, The fifte, the Newe-Thought, y-wis. These arowes that I speke of here, Were alle fyve of oon manere, And alle were they resemblable. To hem was wel sitting and able The foule croked bowe hidous, That knotty was, and al roynous. That bowe semede wel to shete These arowes fyve, that been unmete, Contrarie to that other fyve. But though I telle not as blyve Of hir power, ne of hir might, Her-after shal I tellen right The sothe, and eek signifiaunce, As fer as I have remembraunce: Al shall be seid, I undertake, Er of this boke an ende I make. Now come I to my tale ageyn. But alderfirst, I wol you seyn The fasoun and the countenaunces Of al the folk that on the daunce is. The God of Love, Iolyf and light, Ladde on his honde a lady bright, Of high prys, and of greet degree. This lady called was Beautee, [As was] an arowe, of which I tolde. Ful wel [y]-thewed was she holde; Ne she was derk ne broun, but bright, And cleer as [is] the mone-light, Ageyn whom alle the sterres semen But smale candels, as we demen. Hir flesh was tendre as dewe of flour, Hir chere was simple as byrde in bour; As whyt as lilie or rose in rys, Hir face gentil and tretys. Fetys she was, and smal to see; No windred browes hadde she, Ne popped hir, for it neded nought To windre hir, or to peynte hir ought. Hir tresses yelowe, and longe straughten, Unto hir heles doun they raughten: Hir nose, hir mouth, and eye and cheke Wel wrought, and al the remenaunt eke. A ful gret savour and a swote Me thinketh in myn herte rote, As helpe me god, whan I remembre Of the fasoun of every membre! In world is noon so fair a wight; For yong she was, and hewed bright, [Wys], plesaunt, and fetys withalle, Gente, and in hir middel smalle. Bisyde Beaute yede Richesse, An high lady of greet noblesse, And greet of prys in every place. But who-so durste to hir trespace, Or til hir folk, in worde or dede, He were ful hardy, out of drede; For bothe she helpe and hindre may: And that is nought of yisterday That riche folk have ful gret might To helpe, and eek to greve a wight. The beste and grettest of valour Diden Richesse ful gret honour, And besy weren hir to serve; For that they wolde hir love deserve, They cleped hir ‘Lady,’ grete and smalle; This wyde world hir dredeth alle; This world is al in hir daungere. Hir court hath many a losengere, And many a traytour envious, That been ful besy and curious For to dispreisen, and to blame That best deserven love and name. Bifore the folk, hem to bigylen, These losengeres hem preyse, and smylen, And thus the world with word anoynten; But afterward they [prikke] and poynten The folk right to the bare boon, Bihinde her bak whan they ben goon, And foule abate the folkes prys. Ful many a worthy man and wys, An hundred, have [they] don to dye, These losengeres, through flaterye; And maketh folk ful straunge be, Ther-as hem oughte be prive. Wel yvel mote they thryve and thee, And yvel aryved mote they be, These losengeres, ful of envye! No good man loveth hir companye. Richesse a robe of purpre on hadde, Ne trowe not that I lye or madde; For in this world is noon it liche, Ne by a thousand deel so riche, Ne noon so fair; for it ful wel With orfrays leyd was everydel, And portrayed in the ribaninges Of dukes stories, and of kinges. And with a bend of gold tasseled, And knoppes fyne of gold ameled. Aboute hir nekke of gentil entaile Was shet the riche chevesaile, In which ther was ful gret plentee Of stones clere and bright to see. Rychesse a girdel hadde upon, The bokel of it was of a stoon Of vertu greet, and mochel of might; For who-so bar the stoon so bright, Of venim [thurte] him no-thing doute, While he the stoon hadde him aboute. That stoon was greetly for to love, And til a riche mannes bihove Worth al the gold in Rome and Fryse. The mourdaunt, wrought in noble wyse, Was of a stoon ful precious, That was so fyn and vertuous, That hool a man it coude make Of palasye, and of tooth-ake. And yit the stoon hadde suche a grace, That he was siker in every place, Al thilke day, not blind to been, That fasting mighte that stoon seen. The barres were of gold ful fyne, Upon a tissu of satyne, Ful hevy, greet, and no-thing light, In everich was a besaunt-wight. Upon the tresses of Richesse Was set a cercle, for noblesse, Of brend gold, that ful lighte shoon; So fair, trowe I, was never noon. But he were cunning, for the nones, That coude devysen alle the stones That in that cercle shewen clere; It is a wonder thing to here. For no man coude preyse or gesse Of hem the valewe or richesse. Rubyes there were, saphyres, iagounces, And emeraudes, more than two ounces. But al bifore, ful sotilly, A fyn carboucle set saugh I. The stoon so cleer was and so bright, That, al-so sone as it was night, Men mighte seen to go, for nede, A myle or two, in lengthe and brede. Swich light [tho] sprang out of the stoon, That Richesse wonder brighte shoon, Bothe hir heed, and al hir face, And eke aboute hir al the place. Dame Richesse on hir hond gan lede A yong man ful of semelihede, That she best loved of any thing; His lust was muche in housholding. In clothing was he ful fetys, And lovede wel have hors of prys. He wende to have reproved be Of thefte or mordre, if that he Hadde in his stable an hakeney. And therfore he desyred ay To been aqueynted with Richesse; For al his purpos, as I gesse, Was for to make greet dispense, Withoute werning or defence. And Richesse mighte it wel sustene, And hir dispenses wel mayntene, And him alwey swich plentee sende Of gold and silver for to spende Withoute lakking or daungere, As it were poured in a garnere. And after on the daunce wente Largesse, that sette al hir entente For to be honourable and free; Of Alexandres kin was she; Hir moste Ioye was, y-wis, Whan that she yaf, and seide, ‘have this.’ Not Avarice, the foule caytyf, Was half to grype so ententyf, As Largesse is to yeve and spende. And god y-nough alwey hir sende, So that the more she yaf awey, The more, y-wis, she hadde alwey. Gret loos hath Largesse, and gret prys; For bothe wys folk and unwys Were hoolly to hir baundon brought, So wel with yiftes hath she wrought. And if she hadde an enemy, I trowe, that she coude craftily Make him ful sone hir freend to be, So large of yift and free was she; Therfore she stood in love and grace Of riche and povre in every place. A ful gret fool is he, y-wis, That bothe riche and nigard is. A lord may have no maner vice That greveth more than avarice. For nigard never with strengthe of hond May winne him greet lordship or lond. For freendes al to fewe hath he To doon his wil perfourmed be. And who-so wol have freendes here, He may not holde his tresour dere. For by ensample I telle this, Right as an adamaunt, y-wis, Can drawen to him sotilly The yren, that is leyd therby, So draweth folkes hertes, y-wis, Silver and gold that yeven is. Largesse hadde on a robe fresshe Of riche purpur Sarsinesshe. Wel fourmed was hir face and clere, And opened had she hir colere; For she right there hadde in present Unto a lady maad present Of a gold broche, ful wel wrought. And certes, it missat hir nought; For through hir smokke, wrought with silk, The flesh was seen, as whyt as milk. Largesse, that worthy was and wys, Held by the honde a knight of prys, Was sib to Arthour of Bretaigne. And that was he that bar the enseigne Of worship, and the gonfanoun. And yit he is of swich renoun, That men of him seye faire thinges Bifore barouns, erles, and kinges. This knight was comen al newely Fro tourneyinge faste by; Ther hadde he doon gret chivalrye Through his vertu and his maistrye; And for the love of his lemman [Had] cast doun many a doughty man. And next him daunced dame Fraunchyse, Arrayed in ful noble gyse. She was not broun ne dun of hewe, But whyt as snowe y-fallen newe. Hir nose was wrought at poynt devys, For it was gentil and tretys; With eyen gladde, and browes bente; Hir heer doun to hir heles wente. And she was simple as dowve on tree, Ful debonaire of herte was she. She durste never seyn ne do But that [thing] that hir longed to. And if a man were in distresse, And for hir love in hevinesse, Hir herte wolde have ful greet pitee, She was so amiable and free. For were a man for hir bistad, She wolde ben right sore adrad That she dide over greet outrage, But she him holpe his harm to aswage; Hir thoughte it elles a vilanye. And she hadde on a sukkenye, That not of hempen herdes was; So fair was noon in alle Arras. Lord, it was rideled fetysly! Ther nas nat oo poynt, trewely, That it nas in his right assyse. Ful wel y-clothed was Fraunchyse; For ther is no cloth sitteth bet On damiselle, than doth roket. A womman wel more fetys is In roket than in cote, y-wis. The whyte roket, rideled faire, Bitokened, that ful debonaire And swete was she that it bere. By hir daunced a bachelere; I can not telle you what he highte, But fair he was, and of good highte, Al hadde he be, I sey no more, The lordes sone of Windesore. And next that daunced Curtesye, That preised was of lowe and hye, For neither proud ne fool was she. She for to daunce called me, (I pray god yeve hir right good grace!) Whan I com first into the place. She was not nyce, ne outrageous, But wys and war, and vertuous, Of faire speche, and faire answere; Was never wight misseid of here; She bar no rancour to no wight. Cleer broun she was, and therto bright Of face, of body avenaunt; I wot no lady so plesaunt. She were worthy for to bene An emperesse or crouned quene. And by hir wente a knight dauncing That worthy was and wel speking, And ful wel coude he doon honour. The knight was fair and stif in stour, And in armure a semely man, And wel biloved of his lemman. Fair Ydelnesse than saugh I, That alwey was me faste by. Of hir have I, withouten fayle, Told yow the shap and apparayle; For (as I seide) lo, that was she That dide me so greet bountee, That she the gate of the gardin Undide, and leet me passen in. And after daunced, as I gesse, [Youthe], fulfild of lustinesse, That nas not yit twelve yeer of age, With herte wilde, and thought volage; Nyce she was, but she ne mente Noon harm ne slight in hir entente, But only lust and Iolitee. For yonge folk, wel witen ye, Have litel thought but on hir play. Hir lemman was bisyde alway, In swich a gyse, that he hir kiste At alle tymes that him liste, That al the daunce mighte it see; They make no force of privetee; For who spak of hem yvel or wel, They were ashamed never-a-del, But men mighte seen hem kisse there, As it two yonge douves were. For yong was thilke bachelere, Of beaute wot I noon his pere; And he was right of swich an age As Youthe his leef, and swich corage. The lusty folk thus daunced there, And also other that with hem were, That weren alle of hir meynee; Ful hende folk, and wys, and free, And folk of fair port, trewely, Ther weren alle comunly. Whan I hadde seen the countenaunces Of hem that ladden thus these daunces, Than hadde I wil to goon and see The gardin that so lyked me, And loken on these faire loreres, On pyn-trees, cedres, and oliveres. The daunces than y-ended were; For many of hem that daunced there Were with hir loves went awey Under the trees to have hir pley. A, lord! they lived lustily! A gret fool were he, sikerly, That nolde, his thankes, swich lyf lede! For this dar I seyn, out of drede, That who-so mighte so wel fare, For better lyf [thurte] him not care; For ther nis so good paradys As have a love at his devys. Out of that place wente I tho, And in that gardin gan I go, Pleying along ful merily. The God of Love ful hastely Unto him Swete-Loking clepte, No lenger wolde he that he kepte His bowe of golde, that shoon so bright. He [bad] him [bende it] anon-right; And he ful sone [it] sette on ende, And at a braid he gan it bende, And took him of his arowes fyve, Ful sharpe and redy for to dryve. Now god that sit in magestee Fro deedly woundes kepe me, If so be that he [wol] me shete; For if I with his arowe mete, It [wol me greven] sore, y-wis! But I, that no-thing wiste of this, Wente up and doun ful many a wey, And he me folwed faste alwey; But no-wher wolde I reste me, Til I hadde al the [yerde in] be. The gardin was, by mesuring, Right even and squar in compassing; It was as long as it was large. Of fruyt hadde every tree his charge, But it were any hidous tree Of which ther were two or three. Ther were, and that wot I ful wel, Of pomgarnettes a ful gret del; That is a fruyt ful wel to lyke, Namely to folk whan they ben syke. And trees ther were, greet foisoun, That baren notes in hir sesoun, Such as men notemigges calle, That swote of savour been withalle. And alemandres greet plentee, Figes, and many a date-tree Ther weren, if men hadde nede, Through the gardin in length and brede. Ther was eek wexing many a spyce, As clow-gelofre, and licoryce, Gingere, and greyn de paradys, Canelle, and setewale of prys, And many a spyce delitable, To eten whan men ryse fro table. And many hoomly trees ther were, That peches, coynes, and apples bere, Medlers, ploumes, peres, chesteynes, Cheryse, of whiche many on fayn is, Notes, aleys, and bolas, That for to seen it was solas; With many high lorer and pyn Was renged clene al that gardyn; With cipres, and with oliveres, Of which that nigh no plente here is. Ther were elmes grete and stronge, Maples, asshe, ook, asp, planes longe, Fyn ew, popler, and lindes faire, And othere trees ful many a payre. What sholde I telle you more of it? Ther were so many treës yit, That I sholde al encombred be Er I had rekened every tree. These trees were set, that I devyse, Oon from another, in assyse, Five fadome or sixe, I trowe so, But they were hye and grete also: And for to kepe out wel the sonne, The croppes were so thikke y-ronne, And every braunch in other knet, And ful of grene leves set, That sonne mighte noon descende, Lest [it] the tendre grasses shende. Ther mighte men does and roes y-see, And of squirels ful greet plentee, From bough to bough alwey leping. Conies ther were also playing, That comen out of hir claperes Of sondry colours and maneres, And maden many a turneying Upon the fresshe gras springing. In places saw I welles there, In whiche ther no frogges were, And fair in shadwe was every welle; But I ne can the nombre telle Of stremes smale, that by devys Mirthe had don come through condys, Of which the water, in renning, Gan make a noyse ful lyking. About the brinkes of thise welles, And by the stremes over-al elles Sprang up the gras, as thikke y-set And softe as any veluët, On which men mighte his lemman leye, As on a fetherbed, to pleye, For therthe was ful softe and swete. Through moisture of the welle wete Sprang up the sote grene gras, As fair, as thikke, as mister was. But muche amended it the place, That therthe was of swich a grace That it of floures had plente, That both in somer and winter be. Ther sprang the violete al newe, And fresshe pervinke, riche of hewe, And floures yelowe, whyte, and rede; Swich plentee grew ther never in mede. Ful gay was al the ground, and queynt, And poudred, as men had it peynt, With many a fresh and sondry flour, That casten up ful good savour. I wol not longe holde you in fable Of al this gardin delitable. I moot my tonge stinten nede, For I ne may, withouten drede, Naught tellen you the beautee al, Ne half the bountee therewithal. I wente on right honde and on left Aboute the place; it was not left, Til I hadde al the [yerde in] been, In the estres that men mighte seen. And thus whyle I wente in my pley, The God of Love me folowed ay, Right as an hunter can abyde The beste, til he seeth his tyde To shete, at good mes, to the dere, Whan that him nedeth go no nere. And so befil, I rested me Besyde a welle, under a tree, Which tree in Fraunce men calle a pyn. But, sith the tyme of king Pepyn, Ne grew ther tree in mannes sighte So fair, ne so wel woxe in highte; In al that yerde so high was noon. And springing in a marble-stoon Had nature set, the sothe to telle, Under that pyn-tree a welle. And on the border, al withoute, Was writen, in the stone aboute, Lettres smale, that seyden thus, ‘Here starf the faire Narcisus.’ Narcisus was a bachelere, That Love had caught in his daungere, And in his net gan him so streyne, And dide him so to wepe and pleyne, That nede him muste his lyf forgo. For a fair lady, hight Echo, Him loved over any creature, And gan for him swich peyne endure, That on a tyme she him tolde, That, if he hir loven nolde, That hir behoved nedes dye, Ther lay non other remedye. But natheles, for his beautee, So fiers and daungerous was he, That he nolde graunten hir asking, For weping, ne for fair praying. And whan she herde him werne hir so, She hadde in herte so gret wo, And took it in so gret dispyt, That she, withoute more respyt, Was deed anoon. But, er she deyde, Ful pitously to god she preyde, That proude-herted Narcisus, That was in love so daungerous, Mighte on a day ben hampred so For love, and been so hoot for wo, That never he mighte Ioye atteyne; Than shulde he fele in every veyne What sorowe trewe lovers maken, That been so vilaynsly forsaken. This prayer was but resonable, Therefor god held it ferme and stable: For Narcisus, shortly to telle, By aventure com to that welle To reste him in that shadowing A day, whan he com fro hunting. This Narcisus had suffred paynes For renning alday in the playnes, And was for thurst in greet distresse Of hete, and of his werinesse That hadde his breeth almost binomen. Whan he was to that welle y-comen, That shadwed was with braunches grene, He thoughte of thilke water shene To drinke and fresshe him wel withalle; And doun on knees he gan to falle, And forth his heed and nekke out-straughte To drinken of that welle a draughte. And in the water anoon was sene His nose, his mouth, his yën shene, And he ther-of was al abasshed; His owne shadowe had him bitrasshed. For wel wende he the forme see Of a child of greet beautee. Wel couthe Love him wreke tho Of daunger and of pryde also, That Narcisus somtyme him bere. He quitte him wel his guerdon there; For he so musede in the welle, That, shortly al the sothe to telle, He lovede his owne shadowe so, That atte laste he starf for wo. For whan he saugh that he his wille Mighte in no maner wey fulfille, And that he was so faste caught That he him couthe comfort naught, He loste his wit right in that place, And deyde within a litel space. And thus his warisoun he took For the lady that he forsook. Ladyes, I preye ensample taketh, Ye that ayeins your love mistaketh: For if hir deeth be yow to wyte, God can ful wel your whyle quyte. Whan that this lettre, of whiche I telle, Had taught me that it was the welle Of Narcisus in his beautee, I gan anoon withdrawe me, Whan it fel in my remembraunce, That him bitidde swich mischaunce. But at the laste than thoughte I, That scatheles, ful sikerly, I mighte unto The Welle go. Wherof shulde I abasshen so? Unto the welle than wente I me, And doun I louted for to see The clere water in the stoon, And eek the gravel, which that shoon Down in the botme, as silver fyn; For of the welle, this is the fyn, In world is noon so cleer of hewe. The water is ever fresh and newe That welmeth up with wawes brighte The mountance of two finger highte. Abouten it is gras springing, For moiste so thikke and wel lyking, That it ne may in winter dye, No more than may the see be drye. Down at the botme set saw I Two cristal stones craftely In thilke fresshe and faire welle. But o thing soothly dar I telle, That ye wol holde a greet mervayle Whan it is told, withouten fayle. For whan the sonne, cleer in sighte, Cast in that welle his bemes brighte, And that the heet descended is, Than taketh the cristal stoon, y-wis, Agayn the sonne an hundred hewes, Blewe, yelowe, and rede, that fresh and newe is. Yit hath the merveilous cristal Swich strengthe, that the place overal, Bothe fowl and tree, and leves grene, And al the yerd in it is sene. And for to doon you understonde, To make ensample wol I fonde; Right as a mirour openly Sheweth al thing that stant therby, As wel the colour as the figure, Withouten any coverture; Right so the cristal stoon, shyning, Withouten any disceyving, The estres of the yerde accuseth To him that in the water museth; For ever, in which half that he be, He may wel half the gardin see; And if he turne, he may right wel Seen the remenaunt everydel. For ther is noon so litel thing So hid, ne closed with shitting, That it ne is sene, as though it were Peynted in the cristal there. This is the mirour perilous, In which the proude Narcisus Saw al his face fair and bright, That made him sith to lye upright. For who-so loke in that mirour, Ther may no-thing ben his socour That he ne shal ther seen som thing That shal him lede into [loving]. Ful many a worthy man hath it Y-blent; for folk of grettest wit Ben sone caught here and awayted; Withouten respyt been they bayted. Heer comth to folk of-newe rage, Heer chaungeth many wight corage; Heer lyth no reed ne wit therto; For Venus sone, daun Cupido, Hath sowen there of love the seed, That help ne lyth ther noon, ne reed, So cercleth it the welle aboute. His ginnes hath he set withoute Right for to cacche in his panteres These damoysels and bacheleres. Love wil noon other bridde cacche, Though he sette either net or lacche. And for the seed that heer was sowen, This welle is cleped, as wel is knowen, The Welle of Love, of verray right, Of which ther hath ful many a wight Spoke in bokes dyversely. But they shulle never so verily Descripcioun of the welle here, Ne eek the sothe of this matere, As ye shulle, whan I have undo The craft that hir bilongeth to. Alway me lyked for to dwelle, To seen the cristal in the welle, That shewed me ful openly A thousand thinges faste by. But I may saye, in sory houre Stood I to loken or to poure; For sithen [have] I sore syked, That mirour hath me now entryked. But hadde I first knowen in my wit The vertue and [the] strengthe of it, I nolde not have mused there; Me hadde bet ben elles-where; For in the snare I fel anoon, That hath bitraisshed many oon. In thilke mirour saw I tho, Among a thousand thinges mo, A roser charged ful of roses, That with an hegge aboute enclos is. Tho had I swich lust and envye, That, for Parys ne for Pavye, Nolde I have left to goon and see Ther grettest hepe of roses be. Whan I was with this rage hent, That caught hath many a man and shent, Toward the roser gan I go. And whan I was not fer therfro, The savour of the roses swote Me smoot right to the herte rote, As I hadde al embawmed [be.] And if I ne hadde endouted me To have ben hated or assailed, My thankes, wolde I not have failed To pulle a rose of al that route To beren in myn honde aboute, And smellen to it wher I wente; But ever I dredde me to repente, And lest it greved or for-thoughte The lord that thilke gardyn wroughte. Of roses were ther gret woon, So faire wexe never in roon. Of knoppes clos, some saw I there, And some wel beter woxen were; And some ther been of other moysoun, That drowe nigh to hir sesoun, And spedde hem faste for to sprede; I love wel swiche roses rede; For brode roses, and open also, Ben passed in a day or two; But knoppes wilen fresshe be Two dayes atte leest, or three. The knoppes gretly lyked me, For fairer may ther no man see. Who-so mighte haven oon of alle, It oughte him been ful leef withalle. Mighte I [a] gerlond of hem geten, For no richesse I wolde it leten. Among the knoppes I chees oon So fair, that of the remenaunt noon Ne preyse I half so wel as it, Whan I avyse it in my wit. For it so wel was enlumyned With colour reed, as wel [y]-fyned As nature couthe it make faire. And it had leves wel foure paire, That Kinde had set through his knowing Aboute the rede rose springing. The stalke was as risshe right, And theron stood the knoppe upright, That it ne bowed upon no syde. The swote smelle sprong so wyde That it dide al the place aboute— FRAGMENT B. Whan I had smelled the savour swote, No wille hadde I fro thens yit go, But somdel neer it wente I tho, To take it; but myn hond, for drede, Ne dorste I to the rose bede, For thistels sharpe, of many maneres, Netles, thornes, and hoked breres; [Ful] muche they distourbled me, For sore I dradde to harmed be. The God of Love, with bowe bent, That al day set hadde his talent To pursuen and to spyen me, Was stonding by a fige-tree. And whan he sawe how that I Had chosen so ententifly The botoun, more unto my pay Than any other that I say, He took an arowe ful sharply whet, And in his bowe whan it was set, He streight up to his ere drough The stronge bowe, that was so tough, And shet at me so wonder smerte, That through myn eye unto myn herte The takel smoot, and depe it wente. And ther-with-al such cold me hente, That, under clothes warme and softe, Sith that day I have chevered ofte. Whan I was hurt thus in [that] stounde, I fel doun plat unto the grounde. Myn herte failed and feynted ay, And long tyme [ther] a-swone I lay. But whan I com out of swoning, And hadde wit, and my feling, I was al maat, and wende ful wel Of blood have loren a ful gret del. But certes, the arowe that in me stood Of me ne drew no drope of blood, For-why I found my wounde al dreye. Than took I with myn hondis tweye The arowe, and ful fast out it plight, And in the pulling sore I sight. So at the last the shaft of tree I drough out, with the fethers three. But yet the hoked heed, y-wis, The whiche Beautee callid is, Gan so depe in myn herte passe, That I it mighte nought arace; But in myn herte stille it stood, Al bledde I not a drope of blood. I was bothe anguissous and trouble For the peril that I saw double; I niste what to seye or do, Ne gete a leche my woundis to; For neithir thurgh gras ne rote, Ne hadde I help of hope ne bote. But to the botoun ever-mo Myn herte drew; for al my wo, My thought was in non other thing. For hadde it been in my keping, It wolde have brought my lyf agayn. For certeinly, I dar wel seyn, The sight only, and the savour, Alegged muche of my langour. Than gan I for to drawe me Toward the botoun fair to see; And Love hadde gete him, in [a] throwe, Another arowe into his bowe, And for to shete gan him dresse; The arowis name was Simplesse. And whan that Love gan nyghe me nere, He drow it up, withouten were, And shet at me with al his might, So that this arowe anon-right Thourghout [myn] eigh, as it was founde, Into myn herte hath maad a wounde. Thanne I anoon dide al my crafte For to drawen out the shafte, And ther-with-al I sighed eft. But in myn herte the heed was left, Which ay encresid my desyre, Unto the botoun drawe nere; And ever, mo that me was wo, The more desyr hadde I to go Unto the roser, where that grew The fresshe botoun so bright of hewe. Betir me were have leten be; But it bihoved nedes me To don right as myn herte bad. For ever the body must be lad Aftir the herte; in wele and wo, Of force togidre they must go. But never this archer wolde fyne To shete at me with alle his pyne, And for to make me to him mete. The thridde arowe he gan to shete, Whan best his tyme he mighte espye, The which was named Curtesye; Into myn herte it dide avale. A-swone I fel, bothe deed and pale; Long tyme I lay, and stired nought, Til I abraid out of my thought. And faste than I avysed me To drawen out the shafte of tree; But ever the heed was left bihinde For ought I couthe pulle or winde. So sore it stikid whan I was hit, That by no craft I might it flit; But anguissous and ful of thought, I felte such wo, my wounde ay wrought, That somoned me alway to go Toward the rose, that plesed me so; But I ne durste in no manere, Bicause the archer was so nere. For evermore gladly, as I rede, Brent child of fyr hath muche drede. And, certis yit, for al my peyne, Though that I sigh yit arwis reyne, And grounde quarels sharpe of stele, Ne for no payne that I might fele, Yit might I not my-silf withholde The faire roser to biholde; For Love me yaf sich hardement For to fulfille his comaundement. Upon my feet I roos up than Feble, as a forwoundid man; And forth to gon [my] might I sette, And for the archer nolde I lette. Toward the roser fast I drow; But thornes sharpe mo than y-now Ther were, and also thistels thikke, And breres, brimme for to prikke, That I ne mighte gete grace The rowe thornes for to passe, To sene the roses fresshe of hewe. I must abide, though it me rewe, The hegge aboute so thikke was, That closid the roses in compas. But o thing lyked me right wele; I was so nygh, I mighte fele Of the botoun the swote odour, And also see the fresshe colour; And that right gretly lyked me, That I so neer it mighte see. Sich Ioye anoon therof hadde I, That I forgat my malady. To sene [it] hadde I sich delyt, Of sorwe and angre I was al quit, And of my woundes that I had thar; For no-thing lyken me might mar Than dwellen by the roser ay, And thennes never to passe away. But whan a whyle I had be thar, The God of Love, which al to-shar Myn herte with his arwis kene, Caste him to yeve me woundis grene. He shet at me ful hastily An arwe named Company, The whiche takel is ful able To make these ladies merciable. Than I anoon gan chaungen hewe For grevaunce of my wounde newe, That I agayn fel in swoning, And sighed sore in compleyning. Sore I compleyned that my sore On me gan greven more and more. I had non hope of allegeaunce; So nigh I drow to desperaunce, I rought of dethe ne of lyf, Whither that love wolde me dryf. If me a martir wolde he make, I might his power nought forsake. And whyl for anger thus I wook, The God of Love an arowe took; Ful sharp it was and [ful] pugnaunt, And it was callid Fair-Semblaunt, The which in no wys wol consente, That any lover him repente To serve his love with herte and alle, For any peril that may bifalle. But though this arwe was kene grounde As any rasour that is founde, To cutte and kerve, at the poynt, The God of Love it hadde anoynt With a precious oynement, Somdel to yeve aleggement Upon the woundes that he had Through the body in my herte maad, To helpe hir sores, and to cure, And that they may the bet endure. But yit this arwe, withoute more, Made in myn herte a large sore, That in ful gret peyne I abood. But ay the oynement wente abrood; Throughout my woundes large and wyde It spredde aboute in every syde; Through whos vertu and whos might Myn herte Ioyful was and light. I had ben deed and al to-shent But for the precious oynement. The shaft I drow out of the arwe, Roking for wo right wondir narwe; But the heed, which made me smerte, Lefte bihinde in myn herte With other foure, I dar wel say, That never wol be take away; But the oynement halp me wele. And yit sich sorwe dide I fele, That al-day I chaunged hewe, Of my woundes fresshe and newe, As men might see in my visage. The arwis were so fulle of rage, So variaunt of diversitee, That men in everich mighte see Bothe gret anoy and eek swetnesse, And Ioye meynt with bittirnesse. Now were they esy, now were they wood, In hem I felte bothe harm and good; Now sore without aleggement, Now softening with oynement; It softned here, and prikked there, Thus ese and anger togider were. The God of Love deliverly Com lepand to me hastily, And seide to me, in gret rape, ‘Yeld thee, for thou may not escape! May no defence availe thee here; Therfore I rede mak no daungere. If thou wolt yelde thee hastily, Thou shalt [the] rather have mercy. He is a fool in sikernesse, That with daunger or stoutnesse Rebellith ther that he shulde plese; In such folye is litel ese. Be meek, wher thou must nedis bowe; To stryve ageyn is nought thy prowe. Come at ones, and have y-do, For I wol that it be so. Than yeld thee here debonairly.’ And I answerid ful humbly, ‘Gladly, sir; at your bidding, I wol me yelde in alle thing. To your servyse I wol me take; For god defende that I shulde make Ageyn your bidding resistence; I wol not doon so gret offence; For if I dide, it were no skile. Ye may do with me what ye wile, Save or spille, and also sloo; Fro you in no wyse may I go. My lyf, my deth, is in your honde, I may not laste out of your bonde. Pleyn at your list I yelde me, Hoping in herte, that sumtyme ye Comfort and ese shulle me sende; Or ellis shortly, this is the ende, Withouten helthe I moot ay dure, But-if ye take me to your cure. Comfort or helthe how shuld I have, Sith ye me hurte, but ye me save? The helthe of lovers moot be founde Wher-as they token firste hir wounde. And if ye list of me to make Your prisoner, I wol it take Of herte and wil, fully at gree. Hoolly and pleyn I yelde me, Withoute feyning or feyntyse, To be governed by your empryse. Of you I here so much prys, I wol ben hool at your devys For to fulfille your lyking And repente for no-thing, Hoping to have yit in som tyde Mercy, of that [that] I abyde.’ And with that covenaunt yeld I me, Anoon doun kneling upon my knee, Profering for to kisse his feet; But for no-thing he wolde me lete, And seide, ‘I love thee bothe and preyse, Sen that thyn answer doth me ese, For thou answerid so curteisly. For now I wot wel uttirly, That thou art gentil, by thy speche. For though a man fer wolde seche, He shulde not finden, in certeyn, No sich answer of no vileyn; For sich a word ne mighte nought Isse out of a vilayns thought. Thou shalt not lesen of thy speche, For [to] thy helping wol I eche, And eek encresen that I may. But first I wol that thou obay Fully, for thyn avauntage, Anon to do me here homage. And sithen kisse thou shalt my mouth, Which to no vilayn was never couth For to aproche it, ne for to touche; For sauf of cherlis I ne vouche That they shulle never neigh it nere. For curteys, and of fair manere, Wel taught, and ful of gentilnesse He muste ben, that shal me kisse, And also of ful high fraunchyse, That shal atteyne to that empryse. And first of o thing warne I thee, That peyne and gret adversitee He mot endure, and eek travaile, That shal me serve, withoute faile. But ther-ageyns, thee to comforte, And with thy servise to desporte, Thou mayst ful glad and Ioyful be So good a maister to have as me, And lord of so high renoun. I bere of Love the gonfanoun, Of Curtesye the banere; For I am of the silf manere, Gentil, curteys, meek and free; That who [so] ever ententif be Me to honoure, doute, and serve, And also that he him observe Fro trespas and fro vilanye, And him governe in curtesye With wil and with entencioun; For whan he first in my prisoun Is caught, than muste he uttirly, Fro thennes-forth ful bisily, Caste him gentil for to be, If he desyre helpe of me.’ Anoon withouten more delay, Withouten daunger or affray, I bicom his man anoon, And gave him thankes many a oon, And kneled doun with hondis Ioynt, And made it in my port ful queynt; The Ioye wente to myn herte rote. Whan I had kissed his mouth so swote, I had sich mirthe and sich lyking, It cured me of languisshing. He askid of me than hostages:— ‘I have,’ he seide, ‘taken fele homages Of oon and other, where I have been Disceyved ofte, withouten wene. These felouns, fulle of falsitee, Have many sythes bigyled me, And through falshede hir lust acheved, Wherof I repente and am agreved. And I hem gete in my daungere, Hir falshed shulle they bye ful dere. But for I love thee, I seye thee pleyn, I wol of thee be more certeyn; For thee so sore I wol now binde, That thou away ne shalt not winde For to denyen the covenaunt, Or doon that is not avenaunt. That thou were fals it were gret reuthe, Sith thou semest so ful of treuthe.’ ‘Sire, if thee list to undirstande, I merveile thee asking this demande. For-why or wherfore shulde ye O stages or borwis aske of me, Or any other sikirnesse, Sith ye wote, in sothfastnesse, That ye have me surprysed so, And hool myn herte taken me fro, That it wol do for me no-thing But-if it be at your bidding? Myn herte is yours, and myn right nought, As it bihoveth, in dede and thought, Redy in alle to worche your wille, Whether so [it] turne to good or ille. So sore it lustith you to plese, No man therof may you disseise. Ye have theron set sich Iustise, That it is werreyd in many wise. And if ye doute it nolde obeye, Ye may therof do make a keye, And holde it with you for ostage.’ ‘Now certis, this is noon outrage,’ Quoth Love, ‘and fully I accord; For of the body he is ful lord That hath the herte in his tresor; Outrage it were to asken more.’ Than of his aumener he drough A litel keye, fetys y-nough, Which was of gold polisshed clere, And seide to me, ‘With this keye here Thyn herte to me now wol I shette; For al my Iowellis loke and knette I binde under this litel keye, That no wight may carye aweye; This keye is ful of gret poeste.’ With which anoon he touchid me Undir the syde ful softely, That he myn herte sodeynly Without [al] anoy had spered, That yit right nought it hath me dered. Whan he had doon his wil al-out, And I had put him out of dout, ‘Sire,’ I seide, ‘I have right gret wille Your lust and plesaunce to fulfille. Loke ye my servise take at gree, By thilke feith ye owe to me. I seye nought for recreaundyse, For I nought doute of your servyse. But the servaunt traveileth in vayne, That for to serven doth his payne Unto that lord, which in no wyse Can him no thank for his servyse.’ Love seide, ‘Dismaye thee nought, Sin thou for sucour hast me sought, In thank thy servise wol I take, And high of degree I wol thee make, If wikkidnesse ne hindre thee; But, as I hope, it shal nought be. To worship no wight by aventure May come, but-if he peyne endure. Abyde and suffre thy distresse; That hurtith now, it shal be lesse; I wot my-silf what may thee save, What medicyne thou woldist have. And if thy trouthe to me thou kepe, I shal unto thyn helping eke, To cure thy woundes and make hem clene, Wher-so they be olde or grene; Thou shalt be holpen, at wordis fewe. For certeynly thou shalt wel shewe Wher that thou servest with good wille, For to complisshen and fulfille My comaundementis, day and night, Whiche I to lovers yeve of right.’ ‘Ah, sire, for goddis love,’ seide I, ‘Er ye passe hens, ententifly Your comaundementis to me ye say, And I shal kepe hem, if I may; For hem to kepen is al my thought. And if so be I wot hem nought, Than may I [sinne] unwitingly. Wherfore I pray you enterely, With al myn herte, me to lere, That I trespasse in no manere.’ The god of love than chargid me Anoon, as ye shal here and see, Word by word, by right empryse, So as the Romance shal devyse. The maister lesith his tyme to lere, Whan the disciple wol not here. It is but veyn on him to swinke, That on his lerning wol not thinke. Who-so lust love, let him entende, For now the Romance ginneth amende. Now is good to here, in fay, If any be that can it say, And poynte it as the resoun is Set; for other-gate, y-wis, It shal nought wel in alle thing Be brought to good undirstonding: For a reder that poyntith ille A good sentence may ofte spille. The book is good at the ending, Maad of newe and lusty thing; For who-so wol the ending here, The crafte of love he shal now lere, If that he wol so long abyde, Til I this Romance may unhyde, And undo the signifiaunce Of this dreme into Romaunce. The sothfastnesse that now is hid, Without coverture shal be kid, Whan I undon have this dreming, Wherin no word is of lesing. ‘Vilany, at the biginning, I wol,’ sayd Love, ‘over alle thing, Thou leve, if thou wolt [not] be Fals, and trespasse ageynes me. I curse and blame generally Alle hem that loven vilany; For vilany makith vilayn, And by his dedis a cherle is seyn. Thise vilayns arn without pitee, Frendshipe, love, and al bounte. I nil receyve to my servyse Hem that ben vilayns of empryse. ‘But undirstonde in thyn entent, That this is not myn entendement, To clepe no wight in no ages Only gentil for his linages. But who-so [that] is vertuous, And in his port nought outrageous, Whan sich oon thou seest thee biforn, Though he be not gentil born, Thou mayst wel seyn, this is a soth, That he is gentil, bicause he doth As longeth to a gentilman; Of hem non other deme I can. For certeynly, withouten drede, A cherl is demed by his dede, Of hye or lowe, as ye may see, Or of what kinrede that he be. Ne say nought, for noon yvel wille, Thing that is to holden stille; It is no worship to misseye. Thou mayst ensample take of Keye, That was somtyme, for misseying, Hated bothe of olde and ying; As fer as Gaweyn, the worthy, Was preysed for his curtesy, Keye was hated, for he was fel, Of word dispitous and cruel. Wherfore be wyse and aqueyntable, Goodly of word, and resonable Bothe to lesse and eek to mar. And whan thou comest ther men ar, Loke that thou have in custom ay First to salue hem, if thou may: And if it falle, that of hem som Salue thee first, be not dom, But quyte him curteisly anoon Without abiding, er they goon. ‘For no-thing eek thy tunge applye To speke wordis of ribaudye. To vilayn speche in no degree Lat never thy lippe unbounden be. For I nought holde him, in good feith, Curteys, that foule wordis seith. And alle wimmen serve and preyse, And to thy power hir honour reyse. And if that any missayere Dispyse wimmen, that thou mayst here, Blame him, and bidde him holde him stille. And set thy might and al thy wille Wimmen and ladies for to plese, And to do thing that may hem ese, That they ever speke good of thee, For so thou mayst best preysed be. ‘Loke fro pryde thou kepe thee wele; For thou mayst bothe perceyve and fele, That pryde is bothe foly and sinne; And he that pryde hath, him withinne, Ne may his herte, in no wyse, Meken ne souplen to servyse. For pryde is founde, in every part, Contrarie unto Loves art. And he that loveth trewely Shulde him contene Iolily, Withouten pryde in sondry wyse, And him disgysen in queyntyse. For queynt array, withouten drede, Is no-thing proud, who takith hede; For fresh array, as men may see, Withouten pryde may ofte be. ‘Mayntene thy-silf aftir thy rent, Of robe and eek of garnement; For many sythe fair clothing A man amendith in mich thing. And loke alwey that they be shape, What garnement that thou shalt make, Of him that can [hem] beste do, With al that perteyneth therto. Poyntis and sleves be wel sittand, Right and streight upon the hand. Of shoon and botes, newe and faire, Loke at the leest thou have a paire; And that they sitte so fetisly, That these rude may uttirly Merveyle, sith that they sitte so pleyn, How they come on or of ageyn. Were streite gloves, with aumenere Of silk; and alwey with good chere Thou yeve, if thou have richesse; And if thou have nought, spend the lesse. Alwey be mery, if thou may, But waste not thy good alway. Have hat of floures fresh as May, Chapelet of roses of Whitsonday; For sich array ne cost but lyte. Thyn hondis wasshe, thy teeth make whyte, And let no filthe upon thee be. Thy nailes blak if thou mayst see, Voide it awey deliverly, And kembe thyn heed right Iolily. [Fard] not thy visage in no wyse, For that of love is not thempryse; For love doth haten, as I finde, A beaute that cometh not of kinde. Alwey in herte I rede thee Glad and mery for to be, And be as Ioyful as thou can; Love hath no Ioye of sorowful man. That yvel is ful of curtesye That [lauhwith] in his maladye; For ever of love the siknesse Is meynd with swete and bitternesse. The sore of love is merveilous; For now the lover [is] Ioyous, Now can he pleyne, now can he grone, Now can he singen, now maken mone. To-day he pleyneth for hevinesse, To-morowe he pleyeth for Iolynesse. The lyf of love is ful contrarie, Which stoundemele can ofte varie. But if thou canst [som] mirthis make, That men in gree wole gladly take, Do it goodly, I comaunde thee; For men sholde, wher-so-ever they be, Do thing that hem [best] sitting is, For therof cometh good loos and pris. Wher-of that thou be vertuous, Ne be not straunge ne daungerous. For if that thou good rider be, Prike gladly, that men may se. In armes also if thou conne, Pursue, til thou a name hast wonne. And if thy voice be fair and clere, Thou shalt maken no gret daungere Whan to singe they goodly preye; It is thy worship for to obeye. Also to you it longith ay To harpe and giterne, daunce and play; For if he can wel foote and daunce, It may him greetly do avaunce. Among eek, for thy lady sake, Songes and complayntes that thou make; For that wol meve [hem] in hir herte, Whan they reden of thy smerte. Loke that no man for scarce thee holde, For that may greve thee manyfolde. Resoun wol that a lover be In his yiftes more large and free Than cherles that been not of loving. For who ther-of can any thing, He shal be leef ay for to yeve, In [Loves] lore who so wolde leve; For he that, through a sodeyn sight, Or for a kissing, anon-right Yaf hool his herte in wille and thought, And to him-silf kepith right nought, Aftir [swich yift], is good resoun, He yeve his good in abandoun. ‘Now wol I shortly here reherce, Of that [that] I have seid in verse, Al the sentence by and by, In wordis fewe compendiously, That thou the bet mayst on hem thinke, Whether-so it be thou wake or winke; For [that] the wordis litel greve A man to kepe, whanne it is breve. ‘Who-so with Love wol goon or ryde He mot be curteys, and void of pryde, Mery and fulle of Iolite, And of largesse alosed be. ‘First I Ioyne thee, here in penaunce, That ever, withoute repentaunce, Thou set thy thought in thy loving, To laste withoute repenting; And thenke upon thy mirthis swete, That shal folowe aftir whan ye mete. ‘And for thou trewe to love shalt be, I wol, and [eek] comaunde thee, That in oo place thou sette, al hool, Thyn herte, withouten halfen dool, For trecherie, [in] sikernesse; For I lovede never doublenesse. To many his herte that wol depart, Everiche shal have but litel part. But of him drede I me right nought, That in oo place settith his thought. Therfore in oo place it sette, And lat it never thennes flette. For if thou yevest it in lening, I holde it but a wrecchid thing: Therfore yeve it hool and quyte, And thou shalt have the more merite. If it be lent, than aftir soon, The bountee and the thank is doon; But, in love, free yeven thing Requyrith a gret guerdoning. Yeve it in yift al quit fully, And make thy yift debonairly; For men that yift [wol] holde more dere That yeven is with gladsome chere. That yift nought to preisen is That man yeveth, maugre his. Whan thou hast yeven thyn herte, as I Have seid thee here [al] openly, Than aventures shulle thee falle, Which harde and hevy been withalle. For ofte whan thou bithenkist thee Of thy loving, wher-so thou be, Fro folk thou must depart in hy, That noon perceyve thy malady, But hyde thyn harm thou must alone, And go forth sole, and make thy mone. Thou shalt no whyl be in oo stat, But whylom cold and whylom hat; Now reed as rose, now yelowe and fade. Such sorowe, I trowe, thou never hade; Cotidien, ne [yit] quarteyne, It is nat so ful of peyne. For ofte tymes it shal falle In love, among thy peynes alle, That thou thy-self, al hoolly, Foryeten shalt so utterly, That many tymes thou shalt be Stille as an image of tree, Dom as a stoon, without stering Of foot or hond, without speking. Than, sone after al thy peyne, To memorie shalt thou come ageyn, As man abasshed wondre sore, And after sighen more and more. For wit thou wel, withouten wene, In swich astat ful oft have been That have the yvel of love assayd, Wher-through thou art so dismayd. ‘After, a thought shal take thee so, That thy love is to fer thee fro: Thou shalt say, “God, what may this be, That I ne may my lady see? Myne herte aloon is to her go, And I abyde al sole in wo, Departed fro myn owne thought, And with myne eyen see right nought. ‘“Alas, myn eyen sende I ne may, My careful herte to convay! Myn hertes gyde but they be, I praise no-thing what ever they see. Shul they abyde thanne? nay; But goon visyte without delay That myn herte desyreth so. For certeynly, but-if they go, A fool my-self I may wel holde, Whan I ne see what myn herte wolde. Wherfore I wol gon her to seen, Or esed shal I never been, But I have som tokening.” Then gost thou forth without dwelling; But ofte thou faylest of thy desyre, Er thou mayst come hir any nere, And wastest in vayn thy passage. Than fallest thou in a newe rage; For want of sight thou ginnest morne, And homward pensif dost retorne. In greet mischeef than shalt thou be, For than agayn shal come to thee Sighes and pleyntes, with newe wo, That no icching prikketh so. Who wot it nought, he may go lere Of hem that byen love so dere. ‘No-thing thyn herte appesen may, That oft thou wolt goon and assay, If thou mayst seen, by aventure, Thy lyves joy, thyn hertis cure; So that, by grace if thou might Atteyne of hir to have a sight, Than shalt thou doon non other dede But with that sight thyn eyen fede. That faire fresh whan thou mayst see, Thyn herte shal so ravisshed be, That never thou woldest, thy thankis, lete, Ne remove, for to see that swete. The more thou seest in sothfastnesse, The more thou coveytest of that swetnesse; The more thyn herte brenneth in fyr, The more thyn herte is in desyr. For who considreth every del, It may be lykned wondir wel, The peyne of love, unto a fere; For ever [the] more thou neighest nere Thought, or who-so that it be, For verray sothe I telle it thee, The hatter ever shal thou brenne, As experience shal thee kenne. Wher-so [thou] comest in any cost, Who is next fyr, he brenneth most. And yit forsothe, for al thyn hete, Though thou for love swelte and swete, Ne for no-thing thou felen may, Thou shalt not willen to passe away. And though thou go, yet must thee nede Thenke al-day on hir fairhede, Whom thou bihelde with so good wille; And holde thysilf bigyled ille, That thou ne haddest non hardement To shewe hir ought of thyn entent. Thyn herte ful sore thou wolt dispyse, And eek repreve of cowardyse, That thou, so dulle in every thing, Were dom for drede, without speking. Thou shalt eek thenke thou didest foly, That thou were hir so faste by, And durst not auntre thee to say Som-thing, er thou cam away; For thou haddist no more wonne, To speke of hir whan thou bigonne: But yif she wolde, for thy sake, In armes goodly thee have take, It shulde have be more worth to thee Than of tresour greet plentee. ‘Thus shalt thou morne and eek compleyn, And gete enchesoun to goon ageyn Unto thy walk, or to thy place, Where thou biheld hir fleshly face. And never, for fals suspeccioun, Thou woldest finde occasioun For to gon unto hir hous. So art thou thanne desirous A sight of hir for to have, If thou thine honour mightest save, Or any erand mightist make Thider, for thy loves sake; Ful fayn thou woldist, but for drede Thou gost not, lest that men take hede. Wherfore I rede, in thy going, And also in thyn ageyn-coming, Thou be wel war that men ne wit; Feyne thee other cause than it To go that weye, or faste by; To hele wel is no folye. And if so be it happe thee That thou thy love ther mayst see, In siker wyse thou hir salewe, Wherwith thy colour wol transmewe, And eke thy blood shal al to-quake, Thyn hewe eek chaungen for hir sake. But word and wit, with chere ful pale, Shul wante for to telle thy tale. And if thou mayst so fer-forth winne, That thou [thy] resoun durst biginne, And woldist seyn three thingis or mo, Thou shalt ful scarsly seyn the two. Though thou bithenke thee never so wel, Thou shalt foryete yit somdel, But-if thou dele with trecherye. For fals lovers mowe al folye Seyn, what hem lust, withouten drede, They be so double in hir falshede; For they in herte cunne thenke a thing And seyn another, in hir speking. And whan thy speche is endid al, Right thus to thee it shal bifal; If any word than come to minde, That thou to seye hast left bihinde, Than thou shalt brenne in greet martyr; For thou shalt brenne as any fyr. This is the stryf and eke the affray, And the batail that lastith ay. This bargeyn ende may never take, But-if that she thy pees wil make. ‘And whan the night is comen, anon A thousand angres shal come upon. To bedde as fast thou wolt thee dight, Where thou shalt have but smal delyt; For whan thou wenest for to slepe, So ful of peyne shalt thou crepe, Sterte in thy bedde aboute ful wyde, And turne ful ofte on every syde; Now dounward groffe, and now upright, And walowe in wo the longe night, Thyne armis shalt thou sprede abrede, As man in werre were forwerreyd. Than shal thee come a remembraunce Of hir shape and hir semblaunce, Wherto non other may be pere. And wite thou wel, withoute were, That thee shal [seme], somtyme that night, That thou hast hir, that is so bright, Naked bitwene thyn armes there, Al sothfastnesse as though it were. Thou shalt make castels than in Spayne, And dreme of Ioye, al but in vayne, And thee delyten of right nought, Whyl thou so slomrest in that thought, That is so swete and delitable, The which, in soth, nis but a fable, For it ne shal no whyle laste. Than shalt thou sighe and wepe faste, And say, “Dere god, what thing is this? My dreme is turned al amis, Which was ful swete and apparent, But now I wake, it is al shent! Now yede this mery thought away! Twenty tymes upon a day I wolde this thought wolde come ageyn, For it alleggith wel my peyn. It makith me ful of Ioyful thought, It sleeth me, that it lastith noght. A, lord! why nil ye me socoure, The Ioye, I trowe, that I langoure? The deth I wolde me shulde slo Whyl I lye in hir armes two. Myn harm is hard, withouten wene, My greet unese ful ofte I mene. But wolde Love do so I might Have fully Ioye of hir so bright, My peyne were quit me richely. Allas, to greet a thing aske I! It is but foly, and wrong wening, To aske so outrageous a thing. And who-so askith folily, He moot be warned hastily; And I ne wot what I may say, I am so fer out of the way; For I wolde have ful gret lyking And ful gret Ioye of lasse thing. For wolde she, of hir gentilnesse, Withouten more, me onis kesse, It were to me a greet guerdoun, Relees of al my passioun. But it is hard to come therto; Al is but foly that I do, So high I have myn herte set, Where I may no comfort get. I noot wher I sey wel or nought; But this I wot wel in my thought, That it were bet of hir aloon, For to stinte my wo and moon, A loke on [me] y-cast goodly, [Than] for to have, al utterly, Of another al hool the pley. A! lord! wher I shal byde the day That ever she shal my lady be? He is ful cured that may hir see. A! god! whan shal the dawning spring? To ly thus is an angry thing; I have no Ioye thus here to ly Whan that my love is not me by. A man to lyen hath gret disese, Which may not slepe ne reste in ese. I wolde it dawed, and were now day, And that the night were went away; For were it day, I wolde upryse. A! slowe sonne, shew thyn enpryse! Speed thee to sprede thy bemis bright, And chace the derknesse of the night, To putte away the stoundes stronge, Which in me lasten al to longe.” ‘The night shalt thou contene so, Withoute rest, in peyne and wo; If ever thou knewe of love distresse, Thou shalt mowe lerne in that siknesse. And thus enduring shalt thou ly, And ryse on morwe up erly Out of thy bedde, and harneys thee Er ever dawning thou mayst see. Al privily than shalt thou goon, What [weder] it be, thy-silf aloon, For reyn, or hayl, for snow, for slete, Thider she dwellith that is so swete, The which may falle aslepe be, And thenkith but litel upon thee. Than shalt thou goon, ful foule aferd; Loke if the gate be unsperd, And waite without in wo and peyn, Ful yvel a-cold in winde and reyn. Than shal thou go the dore bifore, If thou maist fynde any score, Or hole, or reft, what ever it were; Than shalt thou stoupe, and lay to ere, If they within a-slepe be; I mene, alle save thy lady free. Whom waking if thou mayst aspye, Go put thy-silf in Iupartye, To aske grace, and thee bimene, That she may wite, withouten wene, That thou [a]night no rest hast had, So sore for hir thou were bistad. Wommen wel ought pite to take Of hem that sorwen for hir sake. And loke, for love of that relyke, That thou thenke non other lyke, For [whom] thou hast so greet annoy, Shal kisse thee er thou go away, And hold that in ful gret deyntee. And, for that no man shal thee see Bifore the hous, ne in the way, Loke thou be goon ageyn er day. Suche coming, and such going, Such hevinesse, and such walking, Makith lovers, withouten wene, Under hir clothes pale and lene, For Love leveth colour ne cleernesse; Who loveth trewe hath no fatnesse. Thou shalt wel by thy-selfe see That thou must nedis assayed be. For men that shape hem other wey Falsly her ladies to bitray, It is no wonder though they be fat; With false othes hir loves they gat; For oft I see suche losengeours Fatter than abbatis or priours. ‘Yet with o thing I thee charge, That is to seye, that thou be large Unto the mayd that hir doth serve, So best hir thank thou shalt deserve. Yeve hir yiftes, and get hir grace, For so thou may [hir] thank purchace, That she thee worthy holde and free, Thy lady, and alle that may thee see. Also hir servauntes worshipe ay, And plese as muche as thou may; Gret good through hem may come to thee, Bicause with hir they been prive. They shal hir telle how they thee fand Curteis and wys, and wel doand, And she shal preyse [thee] wel the mare. Loke out of londe thou be not fare; And if such cause thou have, that thee Bihoveth to gon out of contree, Leve hool thyn herte in hostage, Til thou ageyn make thy passage. Thenk long to see the swete thing That hath thyn herte in hir keping. ‘Now have I told thee, in what wyse A lover shal do me servyse. Do it than, if thou wolt have The mede that thou aftir crave.’ Whan Love al this had boden me, I seide him:—‘Sire, how may it be That lovers may in such manere Endure the peyne ye have seid here? I merveyle me wonder faste, How any man may live or laste In such peyne, and such brenning, In sorwe and thought, and such sighing, Ay unrelesed wo to make, Whether so it be they slepe or wake. In such annoy continuely, As helpe me god, this merveile I, How man, but he were maad of stele, Might live a month, such peynes to fele.’ The God of Love than seide me, ‘Freend, by the feith I owe to thee, May no man have good, but he it by. A man loveth more tendirly The thing that he hath bought most dere. For wite thou wel, withouten were, In thank that thing is taken more, For which a man hath suffred sore. Certis, no wo ne may atteyne Unto the sore of loves peyne. Non yvel therto ne may amounte, No more than a man [may] counte The dropes that of the water be. For drye as wel the grete see Thou mightist, as the harmes telle Of hem that with Love dwelle In servyse; for peyne hem sleeth, And that ech man wolde flee the deeth, And trowe they shulde never escape, Nere that hope couthe hem make Glad as man in prisoun set, And may not geten for to et But barly-breed, and watir pure, And lyeth in vermin and in ordure; With alle this, yit can he live, Good hope such comfort hath him yive, Which maketh wene that he shal be Delivered and come to liberte; In fortune is [his] fulle trust. Though he lye in strawe or dust, In hope is al his susteyning. And so for lovers, in hir wening, Whiche Love hath shit in his prisoun; Good-Hope is hir salvacioun. Good-Hope, how sore that they smerte, Yeveth hem bothe wille and herte To profre hir body to martyre; For Hope so sore doth hem desyre To suffre ech harm that men devyse, For Ioye that aftir shal aryse. Hope, in desire [to] cacche victorie; In Hope, of love is al the glorie, For Hope is al that love may yive; Nere Hope, ther shulde no lover live. Blessid be Hope, which with desyre Avaunceth lovers in such manere. Good-Hope is curteis for to plese, To kepe lovers from al disese. Hope kepith his lond, and wol abyde, For any peril that may betyde; For Hope to lovers, as most cheef, Doth hem enduren al mischeef; Hope is her help, whan mister is. And I shal yeve thee eek, y-wis, Three other thingis, that greet solas Doth to hem that be in my las. ‘The firste good that may be founde, To hem that in my lace be bounde, Is Swete-Thought, for to recorde Thing wherwith thou canst accorde Best in thyn herte, wher she be; Thought in absence is good to thee. Whan any lover doth compleyne, And liveth in distresse and peyne, Than Swete-Thought shal come, as blyve, Awey his angre for to dryve. It makith lovers have remembraunce Of comfort, and of high plesaunce, That Hope hath hight him for to winne. For Thought anoon than shal biginne, As fer, god wot, as he can finde, To make a mirrour of his minde; For to biholde he wol not lette. Hir person he shal afore him sette, Hir laughing eyen, persaunt and clere, Hir shape, hir fourme, hir goodly chere, Hir mouth that is so gracious, So swete, and eek so saverous; Of alle hir fetures he shal take heede, His eyen with alle hir limes fede. ‘Thus Swete-Thenking shal aswage The peyne of lovers, and hir rage. Thy Ioye shal double, withoute gesse, Whan thou thenkist on hir semlinesse, Or of hir laughing, or of hir chere, That to thee made thy lady dere. This comfort wol I that thou take; And if the next thou wolt forsake Which is not lesse saverous, Thou shuldist been to daungerous. ‘The secounde shal be Swete-Speche, That hath to many oon be leche, To bringe hem out of wo and were, And helpe many a bachilere; And many a lady sent socoure, That have loved par-amour, Through speking, whan they mighten here Of hir lovers, to hem so dere. To [hem] it voidith al hir smerte, The which is closed in hir herte. In herte it makith hem glad and light, Speche, whan they mowe have sight. And therfore now it cometh to minde, In olde dawes, as I finde, That clerkis writen that hir knewe, Ther was a lady fresh of hewe, Which of hir love made a song On him for to remembre among, In which she seide, “Whan that I here Speken of him that is so dere, To me it voidith al [my] smerte, Y-wis, he sit so nere myn herte. To speke of him, at eve or morwe, It cureth me of al my sorwe. To me is noon so high plesaunce As of his persone daliaunce.” She wist ful wel that Swete-Speking Comfortith in ful muche thing. Hir love she had ful wel assayed, Of him she was ful wel apayed; To speke of him hir Ioye was set. Therfore I rede thee that thou get A felowe that can wel concele And kepe thy counsel, and wel hele, To whom go shewe hoolly thyn herte, Bothe wele and wo, Ioye and smerte: To gete comfort to him thou go, And privily, bitween yow two, Ye shal speke of that goodly thing, That hath thyn herte in hir keping; Of hir beaute and hir semblaunce, And of hir goodly countenaunce. Of al thy state thou shalt him sey, And aske him counseil how thou may Do any thing that may hir plese; For it to thee shal do gret ese, That he may wite thou trust him so, Bothe of thy wele and of thy wo. And if his herte to love be set, His companye is muche the bet, For resoun wol, he shewe to thee Al uttirly his privite; And what she is he loveth so, To thee pleynly he shal undo, Withoute drede of any shame, Bothe telle hir renoun and hir name. Than shal he forther, ferre and nere, And namely to thy lady dere, In siker wyse; ye, every other Shal helpen as his owne brother, In trouthe withoute doublenesse, And kepen cloos in sikernesse. For it is noble thing, in fay, To have a man thou darst say Thy prive counsel every del; For that wol comfort thee right wel, And thou shalt holde thee wel apayed, Whan such a freend thou hast assayed. ‘The thridde good of greet comfort That yeveth to lovers most disport, Comith of sight and biholding, That clepid is Swete-Loking, The whiche may noon ese do, Whan thou art fer thy lady fro; Wherfore thou prese alwey to be In place, where thou mayst hir se. For it is thing most amerous, Most delitable and saverous, For to aswage a mannes sorowe, To sene his lady by the morowe. For it is a ful noble thing Whan thyn eyen have meting With that relyke precious, Wherof they be so desirous. But al day after, soth it is, They have no drede to faren amis, They dreden neither wind ne reyn, Ne [yit] non other maner peyn. For whan thyn eyen were thus in blis, Yit of hir curtesye, y-wis, Aloon they can not have hir Ioye, But to the herte they [it] convoye; Part of hir blis to him [they] sende, Of al this harm to make an ende. The eye is a good messangere, Which can to the herte in such manere Tidyngis sende, that [he] hath seen, To voide him of his peynes cleen. Wherof the herte reioyseth so That a gret party of his wo Is voided, and put awey to flight. Right as the derknesse of the night Is chased with clerenesse of the mone, Right so is al his wo ful sone Devoided clene, whan that the sight Biholden may that fresshe wight That the herte desyreth so, That al his derknesse is ago; For than the herte is al at ese, Whan they seen that [that] may hem plese. ‘Now have I thee declared al-out, Of that thou were in drede and dout; For I have told thee feithfully What thee may curen utterly, And alle lovers that wole be Feithful, and ful of stabilite. Good-Hope alwey kepe by thy syde, And Swete-Thought make eek abyde, Swete-Loking and Swete-Speche; Of alle thyn harmes they shal be leche. Of every thou shalt have greet plesaunce; If thou canst byde in sufferaunce, And serve wel without feyntyse, Thou shalt be quit of thyn empryse, With more guerdoun, if that thou live; But al this tyme this I thee yive.’ The God of Love whan al the day Had taught me, as ye have herd say, And enfourmed compendiously, He vanished awey al sodeynly, And I alone lefte, al sole, So ful of compleynt and of dole, For I saw no man ther me by. My woundes me greved wondirly; Me for to curen no-thing I knew, Save the botoun bright of hew, Wheron was set hoolly my thought; Of other comfort knew I nought, But it were through the God of Love; I knew nat elles to my bihove That might me ese or comfort gete, But-if he wolde him entermete. The roser was, withoute doute, Closed with an hegge withoute, As ye to-forn have herd me seyn; And fast I bisied, and wolde fayn Have passed the haye, if I might Have geten in by any slight Unto the botoun so fair to see. But ever I dradde blamed to be, If men wolde have suspeccioun That I wolde of entencioun Have stole the roses that ther were; Therfore to entre I was in fere. But at the last, as I bithought Whether I sholde passe or nought, I saw come with a gladde chere To me, a lusty bachelere, Of good stature, and of good hight, And Bialacoil forsothe he hight. Sone he was to Curtesy, And he me graunted ful gladly The passage of the outer hay, And seide:—‘Sir, how that ye may Passe, if [it] your wille be, The fresshe roser for to see, And ye the swete savour fele. Your warrant may [I be] right wele; So thou thee kepe fro folye, Shal no man do thee vilanye. If I may helpe you in ought, I shal not feyne, dredeth nought; For I am bounde to your servyse, Fully devoide of feyntyse.’ Than unto Bialacoil saide I, ‘I thank you, sir, ful hertely, And your biheest [I] take at gree, That ye so goodly profer me; To you it cometh of greet fraunchyse, That ye me profer your servyse.’ Than aftir, ful deliverly, Through the breres anoon wente I, Wherof encombred was the hay. I was wel plesed, the soth to say, To see the botoun fair and swote, So fresshe spronge out of the rote. And Bialacoil me served wel, Whan I so nygh me mighte fele Of the botoun the swete odour, And so lusty hewed of colour. But than a cherl (foule him bityde!) Bisyde the roses gan him hyde, To kepe the roses of that roser, Of whom the name was Daunger. This cherl was hid there in the greves, Covered with grasse and with leves, To spye and take whom that he fond Unto that roser putte an hond. He was not sole, for ther was mo; For with him were other two Of wikkid maners, and yvel fame. That oon was clepid, by his name, Wikked-Tonge, god yeve him sorwe! For neither at eve, ne at morwe, He can of no man [no] good speke; On many a Iust man doth he wreke. Ther was a womman eek, that hight Shame, that, who can reken right, Trespas was hir fadir name, Hir moder Resoun; and thus was Shame [On lyve] brought of these ilk two. And yit had Trespas never ado With Resoun, ne never ley hir by, He was so hidous and ugly, I mene, this that Trespas hight; But Resoun conceyveth, of a sight, Shame, of that I spak aforn. And whan that Shame was thus born, It was ordeyned, that Chastitee Shulde of the roser lady be, Which, of the botouns more and las, With sondry folk assailed was, That she ne wiste what to do. For Venus hir assailith so, That night and day from hir she stal Botouns and roses over-al. To Resoun than prayeth Chastitee, Whom Venus flemed over the see, That she hir doughter wolde hir lene, To kepe the roser fresh and grene. Anoon Resoun to Chastitee Is fully assented that it be, And grauntid hir, at hir request, That Shame, bicause she is honest, Shal keper of the roser be. And thus to kepe it ther were three, That noon shulde hardy be ne bold (Were he yong, or were he old) Ageyn hir wille awey to bere Botouns ne roses, that ther were. I had wel sped, had I not been Awayted with these three, and seen. For Bialacoil, that was so fair, So gracious and debonair, Quitte him to me ful curteisly, And, me to plese, bad that I Shuld drawe me to the botoun nere; Prese in, to touche the rosere Which bar the roses, he yaf me leve; This graunt ne might but litel greve. And for he saw it lyked me, Right nygh the botoun pullede he A leef al grene, and yaf me that, The which ful nygh the botoun sat; I made [me] of that leef ful queynt. And whan I felte I was aqueynt With Bialacoil, and so prive, I wende al at my wille had be. Than wex I hardy for to tel To Bialacoil how me bifel Of Love, that took and wounded me, And seide: ‘Sir, so mote I thee, I may no Ioye have in no wyse, Upon no syde, but it ryse; For sithe (if I shal not feyne) In herte I have had so gret peyne, So gret annoy, and such affray, That I ne wot what I shal say; I drede your wrath to disserve. Lever me were, that knyves kerve My body shulde in pecis smalle, Than in any wyse it shulde falle That ye wratthed shulde been with me.’ ‘Sey boldely thy wille,’ quod he, ‘I nil be wroth, if that I may, For nought that thou shalt to me say.’ Thanne seide I, ‘Sir, not you displese To knowen of my greet unese, In which only love hath me brought; For peynes greet, disese and thought, Fro day to day he doth me drye; Supposeth not, sir, that I lye. In me fyve woundes dide he make, The sore of whiche shal never slake But ye the botoun graunte me, Which is most passaunt of beautee, My lyf, my deth, and my martyre, And tresour that I most desyre.’ Than Bialacoil, affrayed all, Seyde, ‘Sir, it may not fall; That ye desire, it may not ryse. What? wolde ye shende me in this wyse? A mochel foole than I were, If I suffrid you awey to bere The fresh botoun, so fair of sight. For it were neither skile ne right Of the roser ye broke the rind, Or take the rose aforn his kind; Ye ar not courteys to aske it. Lat it stil on the roser sit, And growe til it amended be, And parfitly come to beaute. I nolde not that it pulled wer Fro the roser that it ber, To me it is so leef and dere.’ With that sterte out anoon Daungere, Out of the place where he was hid. His malice in his chere was kid; Ful greet he was, and blak of hewe, Sturdy and hidous, who-so him knewe; Like sharp urchouns his here was growe, His eyes rede as the fire-glow; His nose frounced ful kirked stood, He com criand as he were wood, And seide, ‘Bialacoil, tel me why Thou bringest hider so boldly Him that so nygh [is] the roser? Thou worchist in a wrong maner; He thenkith to dishonour thee, Thou art wel worthy to have maugree To late him of the roser wit; Who serveth a feloun is yvel quit. Thou woldist have doon greet bountee, And he with shame wolde quyte thee. Flee hennes, felowe! I rede thee go! It wanteth litel I wol thee slo; For Bialacoil ne knew thee nought, Whan thee to serve he sette his thought; For thou wolt shame him, if thou might, Bothe ageyn resoun and right. I wol no more in thee affye, That comest so slyghly for tespye; For it preveth wonder wel, Thy slight and tresoun every del.’ I durst no more ther make abode, For the cherl, he was so wode; So gan he threten and manace, And thurgh the haye he did me chace. For feer of him I tremblid and quook, So cherlishly his heed he shook; And seide, if eft he might me take, I shulde not from his hondis scape. Than Bialacoil is fled and mate, And I al sole, disconsolate, Was left aloon in peyne and thought; For shame, to deth I was nygh brought. Than thought I on myn high foly, How that my body, utterly, Was yeve to peyne and to martyre; And therto hadde I so gret yre, That I ne durst the hayes passe; There was non hope, there was no grace. I trowe never man wiste of peyne, But he were laced in Loves cheyne; Ne no man [wot], and sooth it is, But-if he love, what anger is. Love holdith his heest to me right wele, Whan peyne he seide I shulde fele. Non herte may thenke, ne tunge seyne, A quarter of my wo and peyne. I might not with the anger laste; Myn herte in poynt was for to braste, Whan I thought on the rose, that so Was through Daunger cast me froo. A long whyl stood I in that state, Til that me saugh so mad and mate The lady of the highe ward, Which from hir tour lokid thiderward. Resoun men clepe that lady, Which from hir tour deliverly Come doun to me withouten more. But she was neither yong, ne hore, Ne high ne low, ne fat ne lene, But best, as it were in a mene. Hir eyen two were cleer and light As any candel that brenneth bright; And on hir heed she hadde a crown. Hir semede wel an high persoun; For rounde enviroun, hir crownet Was ful of riche stonis fret. Hir goodly semblaunt, by devys, I trowe were maad in paradys; Nature had never such a grace, To forge a werk of such compace. For certeyn, but the letter lye, God him-silf, that is so high, Made hir aftir his image, And yaf hir sith sich avauntage, That she hath might and seignorye To kepe men from al folye; Who-so wole trowe hir lore, Ne may offenden nevermore. And whyl I stood thus derk and pale, Resoun bigan to me hir tale; She seide: ‘Al hayl, my swete frend! Foly and childhood wol thee shend, Which thee have put in greet affray; Thou hast bought dere the tyme of May, That made thyn herte mery to be. In yvel tyme thou wentist to see The gardin, wherof Ydilnesse Bar the keye, and was maistresse Whan thou yedest in the daunce With hir, and haddest aqueyntaunce: Hir aqueyntaunce is perilous, First softe, and aftir[ward] noyous; She hath [thee] trasshed, withoute ween; The God of Love had thee not seen, Ne hadde Ydilnesse thee conveyed In the verger where Mirthe him pleyed. If Foly have supprised thee, Do so that it recovered be; And be wel war to take no more Counsel, that greveth aftir sore; He is wys that wol himsilf chastyse. And though a young man in any wyse Trespace among, and do foly, Lat him not tarye, but hastily Lat him amende what so be mis. And eek I counseile thee, y-wis, The God of Love hoolly for-yet, That hath thee in sich peyne set, And thee in herte tormented so. I can nat seen how thou mayst go Other weyes to garisoun; For Daunger, that is so feloun, Felly purposith thee to werrey, Which is ful cruel, the soth to sey. ‘And yit of Daunger cometh no blame, In reward of my doughter Shame, Which hath the roses in hir warde, As she that may be no musarde. And Wikked-Tunge is with these two, That suffrith no man thider go; For er a thing be do, he shal, Where that he cometh, over-al, In fourty places, if it be sought, Seye thing that never was doon ne wrought; So moche tresoun is in his male, Of falsnesse for to [feyne] a tale. Thou delest with angry folk, y-wis; Wherfor to thee [it] bettir is From these folk awey to fare, For they wol make thee live in care. This is the yvel that Love they calle, Wherin ther is but foly alle, For love is foly everydel; Who loveth, in no wyse may do wel, Ne sette his thought on no good werk. His scole he lesith, if he be clerk; Of other craft eek if he be, He shal not thryve therin; for he In love shal have more passioun Than monke, hermyte, or chanoun. The peyne is hard, out of mesure, The Ioye may eek no whyl endure; And in the possessioun Is muche tribulacioun; The Ioye it is so short-lasting, And but in happe is the geting; For I see ther many in travaille, That atte laste foule fayle. I was no-thing thy counseler, Whan thou were maad the homager Of God of Love to hastily; Ther was no wisdom, but foly. Thyn herte was Ioly, but not sage, Whan thou were brought in sich a rage, To yelde thee so redily, And to Love, of his gret maistry. ‘I rede thee Love awey to dryve, That makith thee recche not of thy lyve. The foly more fro day to day Shal growe, but thou it putte away. Take with thy teeth the bridel faste, To daunte thyn herte; and eek thee caste, If that thou mayst, to gete defence For to redresse thy first offence. Who-so his herte alwey wol leve, Shal finde among that shal him greve.’ Whan I hir herd thus me chastyse, I answerd in ful angry wyse. I prayed hir cessen of hir speche, Outher to chastyse me or teche, To bidde me my thought refreyne, Which Love hath caught in his demeyne:— ‘What? wene ye Love wol consent, That me assailith with bowe bent, To draw myn herte out of his honde, Which is so quikly in his bonde? That ye counsayle, may never be; For whan he first arested me, He took myn herte so hool him til, That it is no-thing at my wil; He [taughte] it so him for to obey, That he it sparred with a key. I pray yow lat me be al stille. For ye may wel, if that ye wille, Your wordis waste in idilnesse; For utterly, withouten gesse, Al that ye seyn is but in veyne. Me were lever dye in the peyne, Than Love to me-ward shulde arette Falsheed, or tresoun on me sette. I wol me gete prys or blame, And love trewe, to save my name; Who me chastysith, I him hate.’ With that word Resoun wente hir gate, Whan she saugh for no sermoning She might me fro my foly bring. Than dismayed, I lefte al sool, Forwery, forwandred as a fool, For I ne knew no chevisaunce. Than fel into my remembraunce, How Love bade me to purveye A felowe, to whom I mighte seye My counsel and my privete, For that shulde muche availe me. With that bithought I me, that I Hadde a felowe faste by, Trewe and siker, curteys, and hend, And he was called by name a Freend; A trewer felowe was no-wher noon. In haste to him I wente anoon, And to him al my wo I tolde, Fro him right nought I wold withholde. I tolde him al withoute were, And made my compleynt on Daungere, How for to see he was hidous, And to-me-ward contrarious; The whiche through his cruelte Was in poynt to have meygned me; With Bialacoil whan he me sey Within the gardyn walke and pley, Fro me he made him for to go, And I bilefte aloon in wo; I durst no lenger with him speke, For Daunger seide he wolde be wreke, Whan that he sawe how I wente The fresshe botoun for to hente, If I were hardy to come neer Bitwene the hay and the roser. This Freend, whan he wiste of my thought, He discomforted me right nought, But seide, ‘Felowe, be not so mad, Ne so abaysshed nor bistad. My-silf I knowe ful wel Daungere, And how he is feers of his chere, At prime temps, Love to manace; Ful ofte I have ben in his caas. A feloun first though that he be, Aftir thou shalt him souple see. Of long passed I knew him wele; Ungoodly first though men him fele, He wol meek aftir, in his bering, Been, for service and obeysshing. I shal thee telle what thou shalt do:— Mekely I rede thou go him to, Of herte pray him specialy Of thy trespace to have mercy, And hote him wel, [him] here to plese, That thou shalt nevermore him displese. Who can best serve of flatery, Shal plese Daunger most uttirly.’ My Freend hath seid to me so wel, That he me esid hath somdel, And eek allegged of my torment; For through him had I hardement Agayn to Daunger for to go, To preve if I might meke him so. To Daunger cam I, al ashamed, The which aforn me hadde blamed, Desyring for to pese my wo; But over hegge durst I not go, For he forbad me the passage. I fond him cruel in his rage, And in his hond a gret burdoun. To him I knelid lowe adoun, Ful meke of port, and simple of chere, And seide, ‘Sir, I am comen here Only to aske of you mercy. That greveth me, [sir], ful gretly That ever my lyf I wratthed you, But for to amende I am come now, With al my might, bothe loude and stille, To doon right at your owne wille; For Love made me for to do That I have trespassed hidirto; Fro whom I ne may withdrawe myn herte; Yit shal I never, for Ioy ne smerte, What so bifalle, good or ille, Offende more ageyn your wille. Lever I have endure disese Than do that shulde you displese. ‘I you require and pray, that ye Of me have mercy and pitee, To stinte your yre that greveth so, That I wol swere for evermo To be redressid at your lyking, If I trespasse in any thing; Save that I pray thee graunte me A thing that may nat warned be, That I may love, al only; Non other thing of you aske I. I shal doon elles wel, y-wis, If of your grace ye graunte me this. And ye [ne] may not letten me, For wel wot ye that love is free, And I shal loven, [sith] that I wil, Who-ever lyke it wel or il; And yit ne wold I, for al Fraunce, Do thing to do you displesaunce.’ Than Daunger fil in his entent For to foryeve his maltalent; But al his wratthe yit at laste He hath relesed, I preyde so faste: Shortly he seide, ‘Thy request Is not to mochel dishonest; Ne I wol not werne it thee, For yit no-thing engreveth me. For though thou love thus evermore, To me is neither softe ne sore. Love wher thee list; what recchith me, So [thou] fer fro my roses be? Trust not on me, for noon assay, In any tyme to passe the hay.’ Thus hath he graunted my prayere. Than wente I forth, withouten were, Unto my Freend, and tolde him al, Which was right Ioyful of my tale. He seide, ‘Now goth wel thyn affaire, He shal to thee be debonaire. Though he aforn was dispitous, He shal heeraftir be gracious. If he were touchid on som good veyne, He shuld yit rewen on thy peyne. Suffre, I rede, and no boost make, Til thou at good mes mayst him take. By suffraunce, and [by] wordis softe, A man may overcomen ofte Him that aforn he hadde in drede, In bookis sothly as I rede.’ Thus hath my Freend with gret comfort Avaunced me with high disport, Which wolde me good as mich as I. And thanne anoon ful sodeynly I took my leve, and streight I went Unto the hay; for gret talent I had to seen the fresh botoun, Wherin lay my salvacioun; And Daunger took kepe, if that I Kepe him covenaunt trewly. So sore I dradde his manasing, I durst not breke[n] his bidding; For, lest that I were of him shent, I brak not his comaundement, For to purchase his good wil. It was [hard] for to come ther-til, His mercy was to fer bihinde; I wepte, for I ne might it finde. I compleyned and sighed sore, And languisshed evermore, For I durst not over go Unto the rose I loved so. Thurghout my deming outerly, [Than] had he knowlege certeinly, [That] Love me ladde in sich a wyse, That in me ther was no feyntyse, Falsheed, ne no trecherye. And yit he, ful of vilanye, Of disdeyne, and cruelte, On me ne wolde have pite, His cruel wil for to refreyne, Though I wepe alwey, and compleyne. And while I was in this torment, Were come of grace, by god sent, Fraunchyse, and with hir Pite Fulfild the botoun of bountee. They go to Daunger anon-right To forther me with al hir might, And helpe in worde and in dede, For wel they saugh that it was nede. First, of hir grace, dame Fraunchyse Hath taken [word] of this empryse: She seide, ‘Daunger, gret wrong ye do To worche this man so muche wo, Or pynen him so angerly; It is to you gret vilany. I can not see why, ne how, That he hath trespassed ageyn you, Save that he loveth; wherfore ye shulde The more in cherete of him holde. The force of love makith him do this; Who wolde him blame he dide amis? He leseth more than ye may do; His peyne is hard, ye may see, lo! And Love in no wyse wolde consente That [he] have power to repente; For though that quik ye wolde him sloo, Fro Love his herte may not go. Now, swete sir, is it your ese Him for to angre or disese? Allas, what may it you avaunce To doon to him so greet grevaunce? What worship is it agayn him take, Or on your man a werre make, Sith he so lowly every wyse Is redy, as ye lust devyse? If Love hath caught him in his lace, You for tobeye in every caas, And been your suget at your wille, Shulde ye therfore willen him ille? Ye shulde him spare more, al-out, Than him that is bothe proud and stout. Curtesye wol that ye socour Hem that ben meke undir your cure. His herte is hard, that wole not meke, Whan men of mekenesse him biseke.’ ‘That is certeyn,’ seide Pite; ‘We see ofte that humilitee Bothe ire, and also felonye Venquissheth, and also melancolye; To stonde forth in such duresse, This crueltee and wikkednesse. Wherfore I pray you, sir Daungere, For to mayntene no lenger here Such cruel werre agayn your man, As hoolly youres as ever he can; Nor that ye worchen no more wo On this caytif that languisshith so, Which wol no more to you trespasse, But put him hoolly in your grace. His offense ne was but lyte; The God of Love it was to wyte, That he your thral so gretly is, And if ye harm him, ye doon amis; For he hath had ful hard penaunce, Sith that ye refte him thaqueyntaunce Of Bialacoil, his moste Ioye, Which alle his peynes might acoye. He was biforn anoyed sore, But than ye doubled him wel more; For he of blis hath ben ful bare, Sith Bialacoil was fro him fare. Love hath to him do greet distresse, He hath no nede of more duresse. Voideth from him your ire, I rede; Ye may not winnen in this dede. Makith Bialacoil repeire ageyn, And haveth pite upon his peyn; For Fraunchise wol, and I, Pite, That merciful to him ye be; And sith that she and I accorde, Have upon him misericorde; For I you pray, and eek moneste, Nought to refusen our requeste; For he is hard and fel of thought, That for us two wol do right nought.’ Daunger ne might no more endure, He meked him unto mesure. ‘I wol in no wyse,’ seith Daungere, ‘Denye that ye have asked here; It were to greet uncurtesye. I wol ye have the companye Of Bialacoil, as ye devyse; I wol him letten in no wyse.’ To Bialacoil than wente in hy Fraunchyse, and seide ful curteisly:— ‘Ye have to longe be deignous Unto this lover, and daungerous, Fro him to withdrawe your presence, Which hath do to him grete offence, That ye not wolde upon him see; Wherfore a sorowful man is he. Shape ye to paye him, and to plese, Of my love if ye wol have ese. Fulfil his wil, sith that ye knowe Daunger is daunted and brought lowe Thurgh help of me and of Pite; You [thar] no more afered be.’ ‘I shal do right as ye wil,’ Saith Bialacoil, ‘for it is skil, Sith Daunger wol that it so be.’ Than Fraunchise hath him sent to me. Bialacoil at the biginning Salued me in his coming. No straungenes was in him seen, No more than he ne had wrathed been. As faire semblaunt than shewed he me, And goodly, as aforn did he; And by the honde, withouten doute, Within the haye, right al aboute He ladde me, with right good chere, Al environ the vergere, That Daunger had me chased fro. Now have I leve over-al to go; Now am I raised, at my devys, Fro helle unto paradys. Thus Bialacoil, of gentilnesse, With alle his peyne and besinesse, Hath shewed me, only of grace, The estres of the swote place. I saw the rose, whan I was nigh, Was gretter woxen, and more high, Fresh, rody, and fair of hewe, Of colour ever yliche newe. And whan I had it longe seen, I saugh that through the leves grene The rose spredde to spanishing; To sene it was a goodly thing. But it ne was so spred on brede, That men within might knowe the sede; For it covert was and [en]close Bothe with the leves and with the rose. The stalk was even and grene upright, It was theron a goodly sight; And wel the better, withouten wene, For the seed was not [y]-sene. Ful faire it spradde, [god it blesse! For suche another, as I gesse, Aforn ne was, ne more vermayle. I was abawed for merveyle, For ever, the fairer that it was, The more I am bounden in Loves laas. Longe I abood there, soth to saye, Til Bialacoil I gan to praye, Whan that I saw him in no wyse To me warnen his servyse, That he me wolde graunte a thing, Which to remembre is wel sitting; This is to sayne, that of his grace He wolde me yeve leyser and space To me that was so desirous To have a kissing precious Of the goodly freshe rose, That swetely smelleth in my nose; ‘For if it you displesed nought, I wolde gladly, as I have sought, Have a cos therof freely Of your yeft; for certainly I wol non have but by your leve, So loth me were you for to greve.’ He sayde, ‘Frend, so god me spede, Of Chastite I have suche drede, Thou shuldest not warned be for me, But I dar not, for Chastite. Agayn hir dar I not misdo, For alwey biddeth she me so To yeve no lover leve to kisse; For who therto may winnen, y-wis, He of the surplus of the pray May live in hope to get som day. For who so kissing may attayne, Of loves peyne hath, soth to sayne, The beste and most avenaunt, And ernest of the remenaunt.’ Of his answere I syghed sore; I durst assaye him tho no more, I had such drede to greve him ay. A man shulde not to muche assaye To chafe his frend out of mesure, Nor put his lyf in aventure; For no man at the firste stroke Ne may nat felle doun an oke; Nor of the reisins have the wyne, Til grapes rype and wel afyne Be sore empressid, I you ensure, And drawen out of the pressure. But I, forpeyned wonder stronge, [Thought] that I abood right longe Aftir the kis, in peyne and wo, Sith I to kis desyred so: Til that, [rewing] on my distresse, Ther [to me] Venus the goddesse, Which ay werreyeth Chastite, Came of hir grace, to socoure me, Whos might is knowe fer and wyde, For she is modir of Cupyde, The God of Love, blinde as stoon, That helpith lovers many oon. This lady brought in hir right hond Of brenning fyr a blasing brond; Wherof the flawme and hote fyr Hath many a lady in desyr Of love brought, and sore het, And in hir servise hir hertes set. This lady was of good entayle, Right wondirful of apparayle; By hir atyre so bright and shene, Men might perceyve wel, and seen, She was not of religioun. Nor I nil make mencioun Nor of [hir] robe, nor of tresour, Of broche, [nor] of hir riche attour; Ne of hir girdil aboute hir syde, For that I nil not long abyde. But knowith wel, that certeynly She was arayed richely. Devoyd of pryde certeyn she was; To Bialacoil she wente a pas, And to him shortly, in a clause, She seide: ‘Sir, what is the cause Ye been of port so daungerous Unto this lover, and deynous, To graunte him no-thing but a kis? To werne it him ye doon amis; Sith wel ye wote, how that he Is Loves servaunt, as ye may see, And hath beaute, wher-through [he] is Worthy of love to have the blis. How he is semely, biholde and see, How he is fair, how he is free, How he is swote and debonair, Of age yong, lusty, and fair. Ther is no lady so hauteyne, Duchesse, countesse, ne chasteleyne, That I nolde holde hir ungoodly For to refuse him outerly. His breeth is also good and swete, And eke his lippis rody, and mete Only to pleyen, and to kisse. Graunte him a kis, of gentilnesse! His teeth arn also whyte and clene; Me thinkith wrong, withouten wene, If ye now werne him, trustith me, To graunte that a kis have he; The lasse [to] helpe him that ye haste, The more tyme shul ye waste.’ Whan the flawme of the verry brond, That Venus brought in hir right hond, Had Bialacoil with hete smete, Anoon he bad, withouten lette, Graunte to me the rose kisse. Than of my peyne I gan to lisse, And to the rose anoon wente I, And kissid it ful feithfully. Thar no man aske if I was blythe, Whan the savour soft and lythe Strook to myn herte withoute more, And me alegged of my sore, So was I ful of Ioye and blisse. It is fair sich a flour to kisse, It was so swote and saverous. I might not be so anguisshous, That I mote glad and Ioly be, Whan that I remembre me. Yit ever among, sothly to seyn, I suffre noye and moche peyn. The see may never be so stil, That with a litel winde it [nil] Overwhelme and turne also, As it were wood, in wawis go. Aftir the calm the trouble sone Mot folowe, and chaunge as the mone. Right so farith Love, that selde in oon Holdith his anker; for right anoon Whan they in ese wene best to live, They been with tempest al fordrive. Who serveth Love, can telle of wo; The stoundemele Ioye mot overgo. Now he hurteth, and now he cureth, For selde in oo poynt Love endureth. Now is it right me to procede, How Shame gan medle and take hede, Thurgh whom felle angres I have had; And how the stronge wal was maad, And the castell of brede and lengthe, That God of Love wan with his strengthe. Al this in romance wil I sette, And for no-thing ne wil I lette, So that it lyking to hir be, That is the flour of beaute; For she may best my labour quyte, That I for hir love shal endyte. Wikkid-Tunge, that the covyne Of every lover can devyne Worst, and addith more somdel, (For Wikkid-Tunge seith never wel), To me-ward bar he right gret hate, Espying me erly and late, Til he hath seen the grete chere Of Bialacoil and me y-fere. He mighte not his tunge withstonde Worse to reporte than he fonde, He was so ful of cursed rage; It sat him wel of his linage, For him an Irish womman bar. His tunge was fyled sharp, and squar, Poignaunt and right kerving, And wonder bitter in speking. For whan that he me gan espye, He swoor, afferming sikirly, Bitwene Bialacoil and me Was yvel aquayntaunce and privee. He spak therof so folily, That he awakid Ielousy; Which, al afrayed in his rysing, Whan that he herde [him] Iangling, He ran anoon, as he were wood, To Bialacoil ther that he stood; Which hadde lever in this caas Have been at Reynes or Amyas; For foot-hoot, in his felonye To him thus seide Ielousye:— ‘Why hast thou been so necligent, To kepen, whan I was absent, This verger here left in thy ward? To me thou haddist no reward, To truste (to thy confusioun) Him thus, to whom suspeccioun I have right greet, for it is nede; It is wel shewed by the dede. Greet faute in thee now have I founde; By god, anoon thou shalt be bounde, And faste loken in a tour, Withoute refuyt or socour. For Shame to long hath be thee fro; Over sone she was agoo. Whan thou hast lost bothe drede and fere, It semed wel she was not here. She was [not] bisy, in no wyse, To kepe thee and [to] chastyse, And for to helpen Chastitee To kepe the roser, as thinkith me. For than this boy-knave so boldely Ne sholde not have be hardy, [Ne] in this verger had such game, Which now me turneth to gret shame.’ Bialacoil nist what to sey; Ful fayn he wolde have fled awey, For fere han hid, nere that he Al sodeynly took him with me. And whan I saugh he hadde so, This Ielousye, take us two, I was astoned, and knew no rede, But fledde awey for verrey drede. Than Shame cam forth ful simply; She wende have trespaced ful gretly; Humble of hir port, and made it simple, Wering a vayle in stede of wimple, As nonnis doon in hir abbey. Bicause hir herte was in affray, She gan to speke, within a throwe, To Ielousye, right wonder lowe. First of his grace she bisought, And seide:—‘Sire, ne leveth nought Wikkid-Tunge, that fals espye, Which is so glad to feyne and lye. He hath you maad, thurgh flatering, On Bialacoil a fals lesing. His falsnesse is not now anew, It is to long that he him knew. This is not the firste day; For Wikkid-Tunge hath custom ay Yongé folkis to bewreye, And false lesinges on hem leye. ‘Yit nevertheles I see among, That the loigne it is so longe Of Bialacoil, hertis to lure, In Loves servise for to endure, Drawing suche folk him to, That he had no-thing with to do; But in sothnesse I trowe nought, That Bialacoil hadde ever in thought To do trespace or vilanye; But, for his modir Curtesye Hath taught him ever [for] to be Good of aqueyntaunce and privee; For he loveth non hevinesse, But mirthe and pley, and al gladnesse; He hateth alle [trecherous], Soleyn folk and envious; For [wel] ye witen how that he Wol ever glad and Ioyful be Honestly with folk to pley. I have be negligent, in good fey, To chastise him; therfore now I Of herte crye you here mercy, That I have been so recheles To tamen him, withouten lees. Of my foly I me repente; Now wol I hool sette myn entente To kepe, bothe [loude] and stille, Bialacoil to do your wille.’ ‘Shame, Shame,’ seyde Ielousy, ‘To be bitrasshed gret drede have I. Lecherye hath clombe so hye, That almost blered is myn ye; No wonder is, if that drede have I. Over-al regnith Lechery, Whos might [yit] growith night and day. Bothe in cloistre and in abbey Chastite is werreyed over-al. Therfore I wol with siker wal Close bothe roses and roser. I have to longe in this maner Left hem unclosid wilfully; Wherfore I am right inwardly Sorowful and repente me. But now they shal no lenger be Unclosid; and yit I drede sore, I shal repente ferthermore, For the game goth al amis. Counsel I [mot take] newe, y-wis. I have to longe tristed thee, But now it shal no lenger be; For he may best, in every cost, Disceyve, that men tristen most. I see wel that I am nygh shent, But-if I sette my ful entent Remedye to purveye. Therfore close I shal the weye Fro hem that wol the rose espye, And come to wayte me vilanye, For, in good feith and in trouthe, I wol not lette, for no slouthe, To live the more in sikirnesse, [To] make anoon a forteresse, [To enclose] the roses of good savour. In middis shal I make a tour To putte Bialacoil in prisoun, For ever I drede me of tresoun. I trowe I shal him kepe so, That he shal have no might to go Aboute to make companye To hem that thenke of vilanye; Ne to no such as hath ben here Aforn, and founde in him good chere, Which han assailed him to shende, And with hir trowandyse to blende. A fool is eyth [for] to bigyle; But may I lyve a litel while, He shal forthenke his fair semblaunt.’ And with that word cam Drede avaunt, Which was abasshed, and in gret fere, Whan he wiste Ielousye was there. He was for drede in such affray, That not a word durste he say, But quaking stood ful stille aloon, Til Ielousye his wey was goon, Save Shame, that him not forsook; Bothe Drede and she ful sore quook; [Til] that at laste Drede abreyde, And to his cosin Shame seyde: ‘Shame,’ he seide, ‘in sothfastnesse, To me it is gret hevinesse, That the noyse so fer is go, And the sclaundre of us two. But sith that it is [so] bifalle, We may it not ageyn [do] calle, Whan onis sprongen is a fame. For many a yeer withouten blame We han been, and many a day; For many an April and many a May We han [y]-passed, not [a]shamed, Til Ielousye hath us blamed Of mistrust and suspecioun Causeles, withouten enchesoun. Go we to Daunger hastily, And late us shewe him openly, That he hath not aright [y]-wrought, Whan that he sette nought his thought To kepe better the purpryse; In his doing he is not wyse. He hath to us [y]-do gret wrong, That hath suffred now so long Bialacoil to have his wille, Alle his lustes to fulfille. He must amende it utterly, Or ellis shal he vilaynsly Exyled be out of this londe; For he the werre may not withstonde Of Ielousye, nor the greef, Sith Bialacoil is at mischeef.’ To Daunger, Shame and Drede anoon The righte wey ben [bothe a]-goon. The cherl they founden hem aforn Ligging undir an hawethorn. Undir his heed no pilowe was, But in the stede a trusse of gras. He slombred, and a nappe he took, Til Shame pitously him shook, And greet manace on him gan make. ‘Why slepist thou whan thou shulde wake?’ Quod Shame; ‘thou dost us vilanye! Who tristith thee, he doth folye, To kepe roses or botouns, Whan they ben faire in hir sesouns. Thou art woxe to familiere Where thou shulde be straunge of chere, Stout of thy port, redy to greve. Thou dost gret foly for to leve Bialacoil here-in, to calle The yonder man to shenden us alle. Though that thou slepe, we may here Of Ielousie gret noyse here. Art thou now late? ryse up [in hy], And stoppe sone and deliverly Alle the gappis of the hay; Do no favour, I thee pray. It fallith no-thing to thy name Make fair semblaunt, where thou maist blame. ‘If Bialacoil be swete and free, Dogged and fel thou shuldist be; Froward and outrageous, y-wis; A cherl chaungeth that curteis is. This have I herd ofte in seying, That man [ne] may, for no daunting, Make a sperhauke of a bosarde. Alle men wole holde thee for musarde, That debonair have founden thee, It sit thee nought curteis to be; To do men plesaunce or servyse, In thee it is recreaundyse. Let thy werkis, fer and nere, Be lyke thy name, which is Daungere.’ Than, al abawid in shewing, Anoon spak Dreed, right thus seying, And seide, ‘Daunger, I drede me That thou ne wolt [not] bisy be To kepe that thou hast to kepe; Whan thou shuldist wake, thou art aslepe. Thou shalt be greved certeynly, If thee aspye Ielousy, Or if he finde thee in blame. He hath to-day assailed Shame, And chased awey, with gret manace, Bialacoil out of this place, And swereth shortly that he shal Enclose him in a sturdy wal; And al is for thy wikkednesse, For that thee faileth straungenesse. Thyn herte, I trowe, be failed al; Thou shalt repente in special, If Ielousye the sothe knewe; Thou shalt forthenke, and sore rewe.’ With that the cherl his clubbe gan shake, Frouning his eyen gan to make, And hidous chere; as man in rage, For ire he brente in his visage. Whan that he herde him blamed so, He seide, ‘Out of my wit I go; To be discomfit I have gret wrong. Certis, I have now lived to long, Sith I may not this closer kepe; Al quik I wolde be dolven depe, If any man shal more repeire Into this garden, for foule or faire. Myn herte for ire goth a-fere, That I lete any entre here. I have do foly, now I see, But now it shal amended bee. Who settith foot here any more, Truly, he shal repente it sore; For no man mo into this place Of me to entre shal have grace. Lever I hadde, with swerdis tweyne Thurgh-out myn herte, in every veyne Perced to be, with many a wounde, Than slouthe shulde in me be founde. From hennesforth, by night or day, I shal defende it, if I may, Withouten any excepcioun Of ech maner condicioun; And if I any man it graunte, Holdeth me for recreaunte.’ Than Daunger on his feet gan stonde, And hente a burdoun in his honde. Wroth in his ire, ne lefte he nought, But thurgh the verger he hath sought. If he might finde hole or trace, Wher-thurgh that men mot forthby pace, Or any gappe, he dide it close, That no man mighte touche a rose Of the roser al aboute; He shitteth every man withoute. Thus day by day Daunger is wers, More wondirful and more divers, And feller eek than ever he was; For him ful oft I singe ‘allas!’ For I ne may nought, thurgh his ire, Recover that I most desire. Myn herte, allas, wol brest a-two, For Bialacoil I wratthed so. For certeynly, in every membre I quake, whan I me remembre Of the botoun, which [that] I wolde Fulle ofte a day seen and biholde. And whan I thenke upon the kisse, And how muche Ioye and blisse I hadde thurgh the savour swete, For wante of it I grone and grete. Me thenkith I fele yit in my nose The swete savour of the rose. And now I woot that I mot go So fer the fresshe floures fro, To me ful welcome were the deeth; Absens therof, allas, me sleeth! For whylom with this rose, allas, I touched nose, mouth, and face; But now the deeth I must abyde. But Love consente, another tyde, That onis I touche may and kisse, I trowe my peyne shal never lisse. Theron is al my coveityse, Which brent myn herte in many wyse. Now shal repaire agayn sighinge, Long wacche on nightis, and no slepinge; Thought in wisshing, torment, and wo, With many a turning to and fro, That half my peyne I can not telle. For I am fallen into helle From paradys and welthe, the more My turment greveth; more and more Anoyeth now the bittirnesse, That I toforn have felt swetnesse. And Wikkid-Tunge, thurgh his falshede, Causeth al my wo and drede. On me he leyeth a pitous charge, Bicause his tunge was to large. Now it is tyme, shortly that I Telle you som-thing of Ielousy, That was in gret suspecioun. Aboute him lefte he no masoun, That stoon coude leye, ne querrour; He hired hem to make a tour. And first, the roses for to kepe, Aboute hem made he a diche depe, Right wondir large, and also brood; Upon the whiche also stood Of squared stoon a sturdy wal, Which on a cragge was founded al, And right gret thikkenesse eek it bar. Abouten, it was founded squar, An hundred fadome on every syde, It was al liche longe and wyde. Lest any tyme it were assayled, Ful wel aboute it was batayled; And rounde enviroun eek were set Ful many a riche and fair touret. At every corner of this wal Was set a tour ful principal; And everich hadde, withoute fable, A porte-colys defensable To kepe of enemies, and to greve, That there hir force wolde preve. And eek amidde this purpryse Was maad a tour of gret maistryse; A fairer saugh no man with sight, Large and wyde, and of gret might. They [ne] dredde noon assaut Of ginne, gunne, nor skaffaut. [For] the temprure of the mortere Was maad of licour wonder dere; Of quikke lyme persant and egre, The which was tempred with vinegre. The stoon was hard [as] ademant, Wherof they made the foundement. The tour was rounde, maad in compas; In al this world no richer was, Ne better ordeigned therwithal. Aboute the tour was maad a wal, So that, bitwixt that and the tour, Rosers were set of swete savour, With many roses that they bere. And eek within the castel were Springoldes, gunnes, bows, archers; And eek above, atte corners, Men seyn over the walle stonde Grete engynes, [whiche] were nigh honde; And in the kernels, here and there, Of arblasters gret plentee were. Noon armure might hir stroke withstonde, It were foly to prece to honde. Without the diche were listes made, With walles batayled large and brade, For men and hors shulde not atteyne To neigh the diche over the pleyne. Thus Ielousye hath enviroun Set aboute his garnisoun With walles rounde, and diche depe, Only the roser for to kepe. And Daunger [eek], erly and late The keyes kepte of the utter gate, The which openeth toward the eest. And he hadde with him atte leest Thritty servauntes, echon by name. That other gate kepte Shame, Which openede, as it was couth, Toward the parte of the south. Sergeauntes assigned were hir to Ful many, hir wille for to do. Than Drede hadde in hir baillye The keping of the conestablerye, Toward the north, I undirstonde, That opened upon the left honde, The which for no-thing may be sure, But-if she do [hir] bisy cure Erly on morowe and also late, Strongly to shette and barre the gate. Of every thing that she may see Drede is aferd, wher-so she be; For with a puff of litel winde Drede is astonied in hir minde. Therfore, for stelinge of the rose, I rede hir nought the yate unclose. A foulis flight wol make hir flee, And eek a shadowe, if she it see. Thanne Wikked-Tunge, ful of envye, With soudiours of Normandye, As he that causeth al the bate, Was keper of the fourthe gate, And also to the tother three He went ful ofte, for to see. Whan his lot was to wake a-night, His instrumentis wolde he dight, For to blowe and make soun, Ofter than he hath enchesoun; And walken oft upon the wal, Corners and wikettis over-al Ful narwe serchen and espye; Though he nought fond, yit wolde he lye. Discordaunt ever fro armonye, And distoned from melodye, Controve he wolde, and foule fayle, With hornpypes of Cornewayle. In floytes made he discordaunce, And in his musik, with mischaunce, He wolde seyn, with notes newe, That he [ne] fond no womman trewe, Ne that he saugh never, in his lyf, Unto hir husbonde a trewe wyf; Ne noon so ful of honestee, That she nil laughe and mery be Whan that she hereth, or may espye, A man speken of lecherye. Everich of hem hath somme vyce; Oon is dishonest, another is nyce; If oon be ful of vilanye, Another hath a likerous ye; If oon be ful of wantonesse, Another is a chideresse. Thus Wikked-Tunge (god yeve him shame!) Can putte hem everichone in blame Withoute desert and causeles; He lyeth, though they been giltles. I have pite to seen the sorwe, That waketh bothe eve and morwe, To innocents doth such grevaunce; I pray god yeve him evel chaunce, That he ever so bisy is Of any womman to seyn amis! Eek Ielousye god confounde, That hath [y]-maad a tour so rounde, And made aboute a garisoun To sette Bialacoil in prisoun; The which is shet there in the tour, Ful longe to holde there soiour, There for to liven in penaunce. And for to do him more grevaunce, [Ther] hath ordeyned Ielousye An olde vekke, for to espye The maner of his governaunce; The whiche devel, in hir enfaunce, Had lerned [muche] of Loves art, And of his pleyes took hir part; She was [expert] in his servyse. She knew ech wrenche and every gyse Of love, and every [loveres] wyle, It was [the] harder hir to gyle. Of Bialacoil she took ay hede, That ever he liveth in wo and drede. He kepte him coy and eek privee, Lest in him she hadde see Any foly countenaunce, For she knew al the olde daunce. And aftir this, whan Ielousye Had Bialacoil in his baillye, And shette him up that was so free, For seure of him he wolde be, He trusteth sore in his castel; The stronge werk him lyketh wel. He dradde nat that no glotouns Shulde stele his roses or botouns. The roses weren assured alle, Defenced with the stronge walle. Now Ielousye ful wel may be Of drede devoid, in libertee, Whether that he slepe or wake; For of his roses may noon be take. But I, allas, now morne shal; Bicause I was without the wal, Ful moche dole and mone I made. Who hadde wist what wo I hadde, I trowe he wolde have had pitee. Love to deere had sold to me The good that of his love hadde I. I [wende a bought] it al queyntly; But now, thurgh doubling of my peyn, I see he wolde it selle ageyn, And me a newe bargeyn lere, The which al-out the more is dere, For the solace that I have lorn, Than I hadde it never aforn. Certayn I am ful lyk, indeed, To him that cast in erthe his seed; And hath Ioie of the newe spring, Whan it greneth in the ginning, And is also fair and fresh of flour, Lusty to seen, swote of odour; But er he it in sheves shere, May falle a weder that shal it dere, And maken it to fade and falle, The stalk, the greyn, and floures alle; That to the tilier is fordone The hope that he hadde to sone. I drede, certeyn, that so fare I; For hope and travaile sikerly Ben me biraft al with a storm; The floure nil seden of my corn. For Love hath so avaunced me, Whan I bigan my privitee To Bialacoil al for to telle, Whom I ne fond froward ne felle, But took a-gree al hool my play. But Love is of so hard assay, That al at onis he reved me, Whan I wend best aboven have be. It is of Love, as of Fortune, That chaungeth ofte, and nil contune; Which whylom wol on folke smyle, And gloumbe on hem another whyle; Now freend, now foo, [thou] shalt hir fele, For [in] a twinkling tourneth hir wheel. She can wrythe hir heed awey, This is the concours of hir pley; She can areyse that doth morne, And whirle adown, and overturne Who sittith hieghst, [al] as hir list; A fool is he that wol hir trist. For it [am] I that am com doun Thurgh change and revolucioun! Sith Bialacoil mot fro me twinne, Shet in the prisoun yond withinne, His absence at myn herte I fele; For al my Ioye and al myn hele Was in him and in the rose, That but yon [wal], which him doth close, Open, that I may him see, Love nil not that I cured be Of the peynes that I endure, Nor of my cruel aventure. A, Bialacoil, myn owne dere! Though thou be now a prisonere, Kepe atte leste thyn herte to me, And suffre not that it daunted be; Ne lat not Ielousye, in his rage, Putten thyn herte in no servage. Although he chastice thee withoute, And make thy body unto him loute, Have herte as hard as dyamaunt, Stedefast, and nought pliaunt; In prisoun though thy body be, At large kepe thyn herte free. A trewe herte wol not plye For no manace that it may drye. If Ielousye doth thee payne, Quyte him his whyle thus agayne, To venge thee, atte leest in thought, If other way thou mayest nought; And in this wyse sotilly Worche, and winne the maistry. But yit I am in gret affray Lest thou do not as I say; I drede thou canst me greet maugree, That thou emprisoned art for me; But that [is] not for my trespas, For thurgh me never discovered was Yit thing that oughte be secree. Wel more anoy [ther] is in me, Than is in thee, of this mischaunce; For I endure more hard penaunce Than any [man] can seyn or thinke, That for the sorwe almost I sinke. Whan I remembre me of my wo, Ful nygh out of my wit I go. Inward myn herte I fele blede, For comfortles the deeth I drede. Ow I not wel to have distresse, Whan false, thurgh hir wikkednesse, And traitours, that arn envyous, To noyen me be so coragious? A, Bialacoil! ful wel I see, That they hem shape to disceyve thee, To make thee buxom to hir lawe, And with hir corde thee to drawe Wher-so hem lust, right at hir wil; I drede they have thee brought thertil. Withoute comfort, thought me sleeth; This game wol bringe me to my deeth. For if your gode wille I lese, I mote be deed; I may not chese. And if that thou foryete me, Myn herte shal never in lyking be; Nor elles-where finde solace, If I be put out of your grace, As it shal never been, I hope; Than shulde I fallen in wanhope. Allas, in wanhope?—nay, pardee! For I wol never dispeired be. If Hope me faile, than am I Ungracious and unworthy; In Hope I wol comforted be, For Love, whan he bitaught hir me, Seide, that Hope, wher-so I go, Shulde ay be relees to my wo. But what and she my balis bete, And be to me curteis and swete? She is in no-thing ful certeyn. Lovers she put in ful gret peyn, And makith hem with wo to dele. Hir fair biheest disceyveth fele, For she wol bihote, sikirly, And failen aftir outrely. A! that is a ful noyous thing! For many a lover, in loving, Hangeth upon hir, and trusteth fast, Whiche lese hir travel at the last. Of thing to comen she woot right nought; Therfore, if it be wysly sought, Hir counseille, foly is to take. For many tymes, whan she wol make A ful good silogisme, I drede That aftirward ther shal in dede Folwe an evel conclusioun; This put me in confusioun. For many tymes I have it seen, That many have bigyled been, For trust that they have set in Hope, Which fel hem aftirward a-slope. But natheles yit, gladly she wolde, That he, that wol him with hir holde, Hadde alle tymes [his] purpos clere, Withoute deceyte, or any were. That she desireth sikirly; Whan I hir blamed, I did foly. But what avayleth hir good wille, Whan she ne may staunche my stounde ille? That helpith litel, that she may do, Outake biheest unto my wo. And heeste certeyn, in no wyse, Withoute yift, is not to pryse. Whan heest and deed a-sundir varie, They doon [me have] a gret contrarie. Thus am I possed up and doun With dool, thought, and confusioun; Of my disese ther is no noumbre. Daunger and Shame me encumbre, Drede also, and Ielousye, And Wikked-Tunge, ful of envye, Of whiche the sharpe and cruel ire Ful oft me put in gret martire. They han my Ioye fully let, Sith Bialacoil they have bishet Fro me in prisoun wikkidly, Whom I love so entierly, That it wol my bane be, But I the soner may him see. And yit moreover, wurst of alle, Ther is set to kepe, foule hir bifalle! A rimpled vekke, fer ronne in age, Frowning and yelowe in hir visage, Which in awayte lyth day and night, That noon of hem may have a sight. Now moot my sorwe enforced be; Ful soth it is, that Love yaf me Three wonder yiftes of his grace, Which I have lorn now in this place, Sith they ne may, withoute drede, Helpen but litel, who taketh hede. For here availeth no Swete-Thought, And Swete-Speche helpith right nought. The thridde was called Swete-Loking, That now is lorn, without lesing. [The] yiftes were fair, but not forthy They helpe me but simply, But Bialacoil [may] loosed be, To gon at large and to be free. For him my lyf lyth al in dout, But-if he come the rather out. Allas! I trowe it wol not been! For how shuld I evermore him seen? He may not out, and that is wrong, Bicause the tour is so strong. How shulde he out? by whos prowesse, Out of so strong a forteresse? By me, certeyn, it nil be do; God woot, I have no wit therto! But wel I woot I was in rage, Whan I to Love dide homage. Who was in cause, in sothfastnesse, But hir-silf, dame Idelnesse, Which me conveyed, thurgh fair prayere, To entre into that fair vergere? She was to blame me to leve, The which now doth me sore greve. A foolis word is nought to trowe, Ne worth an appel for to lowe; Men shulde him snibbe bittirly, At pryme temps of his foly. I was a fool, and she me leved, Thurgh whom I am right nought releved. She accomplisshed al my wil, That now me greveth wondir il. Resoun me seide what shulde falle. A fool my-silf I may wel calle, That love asyde I had not leyde, And trowed that dame Resoun seyde. Resoun had bothe skile and right, Whan she me blamed, with al hir might, To medle of love, that hath me shent; But certeyn now I wol repent. ‘And shulde I repent? Nay parde! A fals traitour than shulde I be. The develles engins wolde me take, If I my [lorde] wolde forsake, Or Bialacoil falsly bitraye. Shulde I at mischeef hate him? nay, Sith he now, for his curtesye, Is in prisoun of Ielousye. Curtesye certeyn dide he me, So muche, it may not yolden be, Whan he the hay passen me lete, To kisse the rose, faire and swete; Shulde I therfore cunne him maugree? Nay, certeynly, it shal not be; For Love shal never, [if god wil], Here of me, thurgh word or wil, Offence or complaynt, more or lesse, Neither of Hope nor Idilnesse; For certis, it were wrong that I Hated hem for hir curtesye. Ther is not ellis, but suffre and thinke, And waken whan I shulde winke; Abyde in hope, til Love, thurgh chaunce, Sende me socour or allegeaunce, Expectant ay til I may mete To geten mercy of that swete. ‘Whylom I thinke how Love to me Seyde he wolde taken atte gree My servise, if unpacience Caused me to doon offence. He seyde, “In thank I shal it take, And high maister eek thee make, If wikkednesse ne reve it thee; But sone, I trowe, that shal not be.” These were his wordis by and by; It semed he loved me trewly. Now is ther not but serve him wele, If that I thinke his thank to fele. My good, myn harm, lyth hool in me; In Love may no defaute be; For trewe Love ne failid never man. Sothly, the faute mot nedis than (As God forbede!) be founde in me, And how it cometh, I can not see. Now lat it goon as it may go; Whether Love wol socoure me or slo, He may do hool on me his wil. I am so sore bounde him til, From his servyse I may not fleen; For lyf and deth, withouten wene, Is in his hand; I may not chese; He may me do bothe winne and lese. And sith so sore he doth me greve, Yit, if my lust he wolde acheve To Bialacoil goodly to be, I yeve no force what felle on me. For though I dye, as I mot nede, I praye Love, of his goodlihede, To Bialacoil do gentilnesse, For whom I live in such distresse, That I mote deyen for penaunce. But first, withoute repentaunce, I wol me confesse in good entent, And make in haste my testament, As lovers doon that felen smerte:— To Bialacoil leve I myn herte Al hool, withoute departing, Or doublenesse of repenting.’ Coment Raisoun vient a L'amant. Thus as I made my passage In compleynt, and in cruel rage, And I not wher to finde a leche That couthe unto myn helping eche, Sodeynly agayn comen doun Out of hir tour I saugh Resoun, Discrete and wys, and ful plesaunt, And of hir porte ful avenaunt. The righte wey she took to me, Which stood in greet perplexite, That was posshed in every side, That I nist where I might abyde, Til she, demurely sad of chere, Seide to me as she com nere:— ‘Myn owne freend, art thou yit greved? How is this quarel yit acheved Of Loves syde? Anoon me telle; Hast thou not yit of love thy fille? Art thou not wery of thy servyse That thee hath [pyned] in sich wyse? What Ioye hast thou in thy loving? Is it swete or bitter thing? Canst thou yit chese, lat me see, What best thy socour mighte be? ‘Thou servest a ful noble lord, That maketh thee thral for thy reward, Which ay renewith thy turment, With foly so he hath thee blent. Thou felle in mischeef thilke day, Whan thou didest, the sothe to say, Obeysaunce and eek homage; Thou wroughtest no-thing as the sage. Whan thou bicam his liege man, Thou didist a gret foly than; Thou wistest not what fel therto, With what lord thou haddist to do. If thou haddist him wel knowe, Thou haddist nought be brought so lowe; For if thou wistest what it were, Thou noldist serve him half a yeer, Not a weke, nor half a day, Ne yit an hour withoute delay, Ne never [han] loved paramours, His lordship is so ful of shoures. Knowest him ought?’ L'Amaunt. ‘Ye, dame, parde!’ Raisoun. ‘Nay, nay.’ L'Amaunt. ‘Yes, I.’ Raisoun. ‘Wherof, lat see?’ L'Amaunt. ‘Of that he seyde I shulde be Glad to have sich lord as he, And maister of sich seignory.’ Raisoun. ‘Knowist him no more?’ L'Amaunt. ‘Nay, certis, I, Save that he yaf me rewles there, And wente his wey, I niste where, And I abood bounde in balaunce.’ Raisoun. ‘Lo, there a noble conisaunce! But I wil that thou knowe him now Ginning and ende, sith that thou Art so anguisshous and mate, Disfigured out of astate; Ther may no wrecche have more of wo, Ne caitif noon enduren so. It were to every man sitting Of his lord have knowleching. For if thou knewe him, out of dout, Lightly thou shulde escapen out Of the prisoun that marreth thee.’ L'Amaunt. ‘Ye, dame! sith my lord is he, And I his man, maad with myn honde, I wolde right fayn undirstonde To knowen of what kinde he be, If any wolde enforme me.’ Raisoun. ‘I wolde,’ seid Resoun, ‘thee lere, Sith thou to lerne hast sich desire, And shewe thee, withouten fable, A thing that is not demonstrable. Thou shalt [here lerne] without science, And knowe, withoute experience, The thing that may not knowen be, Ne wist ne shewid in no degree. Thou mayst the sothe of it not witen, Though in thee it were writen. Thou shalt not knowe therof more Whyle thou art reuled by his lore; But unto him that love wol flee, The knotte may unclosed be, Which hath to thee, as it is founde, So long be knet and not unbounde. Now sette wel thyn entencioun, To here of love discripcioun. ‘Love, it is an hateful pees, A free acquitaunce, without relees, [A trouthe], fret full of falshede, A sikernesse, al set in drede; In herte is a dispeiring hope, And fulle of hope, it is wanhope; Wyse woodnesse, and wood resoun, A swete peril, in to droune, An hevy birthen, light to bere, A wikked wawe awey to were. It is Caribdis perilous, Disagreable and gracious. It is discordaunce that can accorde, And accordaunce to discorde. It is cunning withoute science, Wisdom withoute sapience, Wit withoute discrecioun, Havoir, withoute possessioun. It is sike hele and hool siknesse, A thrust drowned [in] dronkenesse, An helthe ful of maladye, And charitee ful of envye, An [hunger] ful of habundaunce, And a gredy suffisaunce; Delyt right ful of hevinesse, And drerihed ful of gladnesse; Bitter swetnesse and swete errour, Right evel savoured good savour; Sinne that pardoun hath withinne, And pardoun spotted without [with] sinne; A peyne also it is, Ioyous, And felonye right pitous; Also pley that selde is stable, And stedefast [stat], right mevable; A strengthe, weyked to stonde upright, And feblenesse, ful of might; Wit unavysed, sage folye, And Ioye ful of turmentrye; A laughter it is, weping ay, Rest, that traveyleth night and day; Also a swete helle it is, And a sorowful Paradys; A plesaunt gayl and esy prisoun, And, ful of froste, somer sesoun; Pryme temps, ful of frostes whyte, And May, devoide of al delyte, With seer braunches, blossoms ungrene; And newe fruyt, fillid with winter tene. It is a slowe, may not forbere Ragges, ribaned with gold, to were; For al-so wel wol love be set Under ragges as riche rochet; And eek as wel be amourettes In mourning blak, as bright burnettes. For noon is of so mochel prys, Ne no man founden [is] so wys, Ne noon so high is of parage, Ne no man founde of wit so sage, No man so hardy ne so wight, Ne no man of so mochel might, Noon so fulfilled of bounte, [But] he with love may daunted be. Al the world holdith this way; Love makith alle to goon miswey, But it be they of yvel lyf, Whom Genius cursith, man and wyf, That wrongly werke ageyn nature. Noon suche I love, ne have no cure Of suche as Loves servaunts been, And wol not by my counsel fleen. For I ne preyse that loving, Wher-thurgh man, at the laste ending, Shal calle hem wrecchis fulle of wo, Love greveth hem and shendith so. But if thou wolt wel Love eschewe, For to escape out of his mewe, And make al hool thy sorwe to slake, No bettir counsel mayst thou take, Than thinke to fleen wel, y-wis; May nought helpe elles; for wite thou this:— If thou flee it, it shal flee thee; Folowe it, and folowen shal it thee.’ L'Amaunt. Whan I hadde herd al Resoun seyn, Which hadde spilt hir speche in veyn: ‘Dame,’ seyde I, ‘I dar wel sey Of this avaunt me wel I may That from your scole so deviaunt I am, that never the more avaunt Right nought am I, thurgh your doctryne; I dulle under your disciplyne; I wot no more than [I] wist [er], To me so contrarie and so fer Is every thing that ye me lere; And yit I can it al parcuere. Myn herte foryetith therof right nought, It is so writen in my thought; And depe graven it is so tendir That al by herte I can it rendre, And rede it over comunely; But to my-silf lewedist am I. ‘But sith ye love discreven so, And lakke and preise it, bothe two, Defyneth it into this letter, That I may thenke on it the better; For I herde never [diffyne it ere], And wilfully I wolde it lere.’ Raisoun. ‘If love be serched wel and sought, It is a sykenesse of the thought Annexed and knet bitwixe tweyne, [Which] male and female, with oo cheyne, So frely byndith, that they nil twinne, Whether so therof they lese or winne. The roote springith, thurgh hoot brenning, Into disordinat desiring For to kissen and enbrace, And at her lust them to solace. Of other thing love recchith nought, But setteth hir herte and al hir thought More for delectacioun Than any procreacioun Of other fruyt by engendring; Which love to god is not plesing; For of hir body fruyt to get They yeve no force, they are so set Upon delyt, to pley in-fere. And somme have also this manere, To feynen hem for love seke; Sich love I preise not at a leke. For paramours they do but feyne; To love truly they disdeyne. They falsen ladies traitoursly, And sweren hem othes utterly, With many a lesing, and many a fable, And al they finden deceyvable. And, whan they her lust han geten, The hoote ernes they al foryeten. Wimmen, the harm they byen ful sore; But men this thenken evermore, That lasse harm is, so mote I thee, Disceyve them, than disceyved be; And namely, wher they ne may Finde non other mene wey. For I wot wel, in sothfastnesse, That [who] doth now his bisynesse With any womman for to dele, For any lust that he may fele, But-if it be for engendrure, He doth trespasse, I you ensure. For he shulde setten al his wil To geten a likly thing him til, And to sustene[n], if he might, And kepe forth, by kindes right, His owne lyknesse and semblable, For bicause al is corumpable, And faile shulde successioun, Ne were ther generacioun Our sectis strene for to save. Whan fader or moder arn in grave, Hir children shulde, whan they ben deede, Ful diligent ben, in hir steede, To use that werke on such a wyse, That oon may thurgh another ryse. Therfore set Kinde therin delyt, For men therin shulde hem delyte, And of that dede be not erke, But ofte sythes haunt that werke. For noon wolde drawe therof a draught Ne were delyt, which hath him caught. This hadde sotil dame Nature; For noon goth right, I thee ensure, Ne hath entent hool ne parfyt; For hir desir is for delyt, The which fortened crece and eke The pley of love for-ofte seke, And thralle hem-silf, they be so nyce, Unto the prince of every vyce. For of ech sinne it is the rote, Unlefulle lust, though it be sote, And of al yvel the racyne, As Tullius can determyne, Which in his tyme was ful sage, In a boke he made of Age, Wher that more he preyseth Elde, Though he be croked and unwelde, And more of commendacioun, Than Youthe in his discripcioun. For Youthe set bothe man and wyf In al perel of soule and lyf; And perel is, but men have grace, The [tyme] of youthe for to pace, Withoute any deth or distresse, It is so ful of wildenesse; So ofte it doth shame or damage To him or to his linage. It ledith man now up, now doun, In mochel dissolucioun, And makith him love yvel company, And lede his lyf disrewlily, And halt him payed with noon estate. Within him-silf is such debate, He chaungith purpos and entent, And yalt [him] into som covent, To liven aftir her empryse, And lesith fredom and fraunchyse, That Nature in him hadde set, The which ageyn he may not get, If he there make his mansioun For to abyde professioun. Though for a tyme his herte absente, It may not fayle, he shal repente, And eke abyde thilke day To leve his abit, and goon his way, And lesith his worship and his name, And dar not come ageyn for shame; But al his lyf he doth so mourne, Bicause he dar not hoom retourne. Fredom of kinde so lost hath he That never may recured be, But-if that god him graunte grace That he may, er he hennes pace, Conteyne undir obedience Thurgh the vertu of pacience. For Youthe set man in al folye, In unthrift and in ribaudye, In leccherye, and in outrage, So ofte it chaungith of corage. Youthe ginneth ofte sich bargeyn, That may not ende withouten peyn. In gret perel is set youth-hede, Delyt so doth his bridil lede. Delyt thus hangith, drede thee nought, Bothe mannis body and his thought, Only thurgh Youthe, his chamberere, That to don yvel is customere, And of nought elles taketh hede But only folkes for to lede Into disporte and wildenesse, So is [she] froward from sadnesse. ‘But Elde drawith hem therfro; Who wot it nought, he may wel go [Demand] of hem that now arn olde, That whylom Youthe hadde in holde, Which yit remembre of tendir age, How it hem brought in many a rage, And many a foly therin wrought. But now that Elde hath hem thurgh-sought, They repente hem of her folye, That Youthe hem putte in Iupardye, In perel and in muche wo, And made hem ofte amis to do, And suen yvel companye, Riot and avouterye. ‘But Elde [can] ageyn restreyne From suche foly, and refreyne, And set men, by hir ordinaunce, In good reule and in governaunce. But yvel she spendith hir servyse, For no man wol hir love, ne pryse; She is hated, this wot I wele. Hir acqueyntaunce wolde no man fele, Ne han of Elde companye, Men hate to be of hir alye. For no man wolde bicomen olde, Ne dye, whan he is yong and bolde. And Elde merveilith right gretly, Whan they remembre hem inwardly Of many a perelous empryse, Whiche that they wrought in sondry wyse, How ever they might, withoute blame, Escape awey withoute shame, In youthe, withoute[n] damage Or repreef of her linage, Losse of membre, sheding of blode, Perel of deth, or losse of good. ‘Wost thou nought where Youthe abit, That men so preisen in her wit? With Delyt she halt soiour, For bothe they dwellen in oo tour. As longe as Youthe is in sesoun, They dwellen in oon mansioun. Delyt of Youthe wol have servyse To do what so he wol devyse; And Youthe is redy evermore For to obey, for smerte of sore, Unto Delyt, and him to yive Hir servise, whyl that she may live. ‘Where Elde abit, I wol thee telle Shortly, and no whyle dwelle, For thider bihoveth thee to go. If Deth in youthe thee not slo, Of this journey thou maist not faile. With hir Labour and Travaile Logged been, with Sorwe and Wo, That never out of hir courte go. Peyne and Distresse, Syknesse and Ire, And Malencoly, that angry sire, Ben of hir paleys senatours; Groning and Grucching, hir herbergeours, The day and night, hir to turment, With cruel Deth they hir present, And tellen hir, erliche and late, That Deth stant armed at hir gate. Than bringe they to hir remembraunce The foly dedis of hir infaunce, Which causen hir to mourne in wo That Youthe hath hir bigiled so, Which sodeynly awey is hasted. She wepeth the tyme that she hath wasted, Compleyning of the preterit, And the present, that not abit, And of hir olde vanitee, That, but aforn hir she may see In the future som socour, To leggen hir of hir dolour, To graunt hir tyme of repentaunce, For hir sinnes to do penaunce, And at the laste so hir governe To winne the Ioy that is eterne, Fro which go bakward Youthe [hir] made, In vanitee to droune and wade. For present tyme abidith nought, It is more swift than any thought; So litel whyle it doth endure That ther nis compte ne mesure. ‘But how that ever the game go, Who list [have] Ioye and mirth also Of love, be it he or she, High or lowe, who[so] it be, In fruyt they shulde hem delyte; Her part they may not elles quyte, To save hem-silf in honestee. And yit ful many oon I see Of wimmen, sothly for to seyne, That [ay] desire and wolde fayne The pley of love, they be so wilde, And not coveite to go with childe. And if with child they be perchaunce, They wole it holde a gret mischaunce; But what-som-ever wo they fele, They wol not pleyne, but concele; But-if it be any fool or nyce, In whom that shame hath no Iustyce. For to delyt echon they drawe, That haunte this werk, bothe high and lawe, Save sich that ar[e]n worth right nought, That for money wol be bought. Such love I preise in no wyse, Whan it is given for coveitise. I preise no womman, though [she] be wood, That yeveth hir-silf for any good. For litel shulde a man telle Of hir, that wol hir body selle, Be she mayde, be she wyf, That quik wol selle hir, by hir lyf. How faire chere that ever she make, He is a wrecche, I undirtake, That loveth such one, for swete or sour, Though she him calle hir paramour, And laugheth on him, and makith him feeste. For certeynly no suche [a] beeste To be loved is not worthy, Or bere the name of druery. Noon shulde hir please, but he were wood, That wol dispoile him of his good. Yit nevertheles, I wol not sey [But] she, for solace and for pley, May a Iewel or other thing Take of her loves free yeving; But that she aske it in no wyse, For drede of shame of coveityse. And she of hirs may him, certeyn, Withoute sclaundre, yeven ageyn, And ioyne her hertes togidre so In love, and take and yeve also. Trowe not that I wolde hem twinne, Whan in her love ther is no sinne; I wol that they togedre go, And doon al that they han ado, As curteis shulde and debonaire, And in her love beren hem faire, Withoute vyce, bothe he and she; So that alwey, in honestee, Fro foly love [they] kepe hem clere That brenneth hertis with his fere; And that her love, in any wyse, Be devoid of coveityse. Good love shulde engendrid be Of trewe herte, iust, and secree, And not of such as sette her thought To have her lust, and ellis nought, So are they caught in Loves lace, Truly, for bodily solace. Fleshly delyt is so present With thee, that sette al thyn entent, Withoute more (what shulde I glose?) For to gete and have the Rose; Which makith thee so mate and wood That thou desirest noon other good. But thou art not an inche the nerre, But ever abydest in sorwe and werre, As in thy face it is sene; It makith thee bothe pale and lene; Thy might, thy vertu goth away. A sory gest, in goode fay, Thou [herberedest than] in thyn inne, The God of Love whan thou let inne! Wherfore I rede, thou shette him out, Or he shal greve thee, out of doute; For to thy profit it wol turne, If he nomore with thee soiourne. In gret mischeef and sorwe sonken Ben hertis, that of love arn dronken, As thou peraventure knowen shal, Whan thou hast lost [thy] tyme al, And spent [thy youthe] in ydilnesse, In waste, and woful lustinesse; If thou maist live the tyme to see Of love for to delivered be, Thy tyme thou shalt biwepe sore The whiche never thou maist restore. (For tyme lost, as men may see, For no-thing may recured be). And if thou scape yit, atte laste, Fro Love, that hath thee so faste Knit and bounden in his lace, Certeyn, I holde it but a grace. For many oon, as it is seyn, Have lost, and spent also in veyn, In his servyse, withoute socour, Body and soule, good, and tresour, Wit, and strengthe, and eek richesse, Of which they hadde never redresse.’ Thus taught and preched hath Resoun, But Love spilte hir sermoun, That was so imped in my thought, That hir doctrine I sette at nought. And yit ne seide she never a dele, That I ne understode it wele, Word by word, the mater al. But unto Love I was so thral, Which callith over-al his pray, He chasith so my thought [alway], And holdith myn herte undir his sele, As trust and trew as any stele; So that no devocioun Ne hadde I in the sermoun Of dame Resoun, ne of hir rede; It toke no soiour in myn hede. For alle yede out at oon ere That in that other she dide lere; Fully on me she lost hir lore, Hir speche me greved wondir sore. [Than] unto hir for ire I seide, For anger, as I dide abraide: ‘Dame, and is it your wille algate, That I not love, but that I hate Alle men, as ye me teche? For if I do aftir your speche, Sith that ye seyn love is not good, Than must I nedis say with mood, If I it leve, in hatrede ay Liven, and voide love away From me, [and been] a sinful wrecche, Hated of all that [love that] tecche. I may not go noon other gate, For either must I love or hate. And if I hate men of-newe More than love, it wol me rewe, As by your preching semeth me, For Love no-thing ne preisith thee. Ye yeve good counseil, sikirly, That prechith me al-day, that I Shulde not Loves lore alowe; He were a fool, wolde you not trowe! In speche also ye han me taught Another love, that knowen is naught, Which I have herd you not repreve, To love ech other; by your leve, If ye wolde diffyne it me, I wolde gladly here, to see, At the leest, if I may lere Of sondry loves the manere.’ Raison. ‘Certis, freend, a fool art thou Whan that thou no-thing wolt allowe That I [thee] for thy profit say. Yit wol I sey thee more, in fay; For I am redy, at the leste, To accomplisshe thy requeste, But I not wher it wol avayle; In veyne, perauntre, I shal travayle. Love ther is in sondry wyse, As I shal thee here devyse. For som love leful is and good; I mene not that which makith thee wood, And bringith thee in many a fit, And ravisshith fro thee al thy wit, It is so merveilous and queynt; With such love be no more aqueynt. Comment Raisoun diffinist Amistie. ‘Love of Frendshipe also ther is, Which makith no man doon amis, Of wille knit bitwixe two, That wol not breke for wele ne wo; Which long is lykly to contune, Whan wille and goodis ben in comune; Grounded by goddis ordinaunce, Hool, withoute discordaunce; With hem holding comuntee Of al her goode in charitee, That ther be noon excepcioun Thurgh chaunging of entencioun; That ech helpe other at hir neede, And wysly hele bothe word and dede; Trewe of mening, devoid of slouthe, For wit is nought withoute trouthe; So that the ton dar al his thought Seyn to his freend, and spare nought, As to him-silf, without dreding To be discovered by wreying. For glad is that coniunccioun, Whan ther is noon suspecioun [Ne lak in hem], whom they wolde prove That trew and parfit weren in love. For no man may be amiable, But-if he be so ferme and stable, That fortune chaunge him not, ne blinde, But that his freend alwey him finde, Bothe pore and riche, in oon [e]state. For if his freend, thurgh any gate, Wol compleyne of his povertee, He shulde not byde so long, til he Of his helping him requere; For good deed, done [but] thurgh prayere, Is sold, and bought to dere, y-wis, To hert that of gret valour is. For hert fulfilled of gentilnesse Can yvel demene his distresse. And man that worthy is of name To asken often hath gret shame. A good man brenneth in his thought For shame, whan he axeth ought. He hath gret thought, and dredith ay For his disese, whan he shal pray His freend, lest that he warned be, Til that he preve his stabiltee. But whan that he hath founden oon That trusty is and trew as stone, And [hath] assayed him at al, And found him stedefast as a wal, And of his freendship be certeyne, He shal him shewe bothe Ioye and peyne, And al that [he] dar thinke or sey, Withoute shame, as he wel may. For how shulde he ashamed be Of sich oon as I tolde thee? For whan he woot his secree thought, The thridde shal knowe ther-of right nought; For tweyn in nombre is bet than three In every counsel and secree. Repreve he dredeth never a del, Who that biset his wordis wel; For every wys man, out of drede, Can kepe his tunge til he see nede; And fooles can not holde hir tunge; A fooles belle is sone runge. Yit shal a trewe freend do more To helpe his felowe of his sore, And socoure him, whan he hath nede, In al that he may doon in dede; And gladder [be] that he him plesith Than [is] his felowe that he esith. And if he do not his requeste, He shal as mochel him moleste As his felow, for that he May not fulfille his voluntee [As] fully as he hath requered. If bothe the hertis Love hath fered, Joy and wo they shul depart, And take evenly ech his part. Half his anoy he shal have ay, And comfort [him] what that he may; And of his blisse parte shal he, If love wol departed be. ‘And whilom of this [amitee] Spak Tullius in a ditee; [“A man] shulde maken his request Unto his freend, that is honest; And he goodly shulde it fulfille, But it the more were out of skile, And otherwise not graunt therto, Except only in [cases] two: If men his freend to deth wolde dryve, Lat him be bisy to save his lyve. Also if men wolen him assayle, Of his wurship to make him faile, And hindren him of his renoun, Lat him, with ful entencioun, His dever doon in ech degree That his freend ne shamed be, In this two [cases] with his might, Taking no kepe to skile nor right, As ferre as love may him excuse; This oughte no man to refuse.” This love that I have told to thee Is no-thing contrarie to me; This wol I that thou folowe wel, And leve the tother everydel. This love to vertu al attendith, The tothir fooles blent and shendith. ‘Another love also there is, That is contrarie unto this, Which desyre is so constreyned That [it] is but wille feyned; Awey fro trouthe it doth so varie, That to good love it is contrarie; For it maymeth, in many wyse, Syke hertis with coveityse; Al in winning and in profyt Sich love settith his delyt. This love so hangeth in balaunce That, if it lese his hope, perchaunce, Of lucre, that he is set upon, It wol faile, and quenche anon; For no man may be amorous, Ne in his living vertuous, But-[if] he love more, in mood, Men for hem-silf than for hir good. For love that profit doth abyde Is fals, and bit not in no tyde. [This] love cometh of dame Fortune, That litel whyle wol contune; For it shal chaungen wonder sone, And take eclips right as the mone, Whan she is from us [y]-let Thurgh erthe, that bitwixe is set The sonne and hir, as it may falle, Be it in party, or in alle; The shadowe maketh her bemis merke, And hir hornes to shewe derke, That part where she hath lost hir lyght Of Phebus fully, and the sight; Til, whan the shadowe is overpast, She is enlumined ageyn as faste, Thurgh brightnesse of the sonne bemes That yeveth to hir ageyn hir lemes. That love is right of sich nature; Now is [it] fair, and now obscure, Now bright, now clipsy of manere, And whylom dim, and whylom clere. As sone as Poverte ginneth take, With mantel and [with] wedis blake [It] hidith of Love the light awey, That into night it turneth day; It may not see Richesse shyne Til the blakke shadowes fyne. For, whan Richesse shyneth bright, Love recovereth ageyn his light; And whan it failith, he wol flit, And as she [groweth, so groweth] it. ‘Of this love, here what I sey:— The riche men are loved ay, And namely tho that sparand bene, That wol not wasshe hir hertes clene Of the filthe, nor of the vyce Of gredy brenning avaryce. The riche man ful fond is, y-wis, That weneth that he loved is. If that his herte it undirstood, It is not he, it is his good; He may wel witen in his thought, His good is loved, and he right nought. For if he be a nigard eke, Men wole not sette by him a leke, But haten him; this is the soth. Lo, what profit his catel doth! Of every man that may him see, It geteth him nought but enmitee. But he amende him of that vyce, And knowe him-silf, he is not wys. ‘Certis, he shulde ay freendly be, To gete him love also ben free, Or ellis he is not wyse ne sage No more than is a gote ramage. That he not loveth, his dede proveth, Whan he his richesse so wel loveth, That he wol hyde it ay and spare, His pore freendis seen forfare; To kepe [it ay is] his purpose, Til for drede his eyen close, And til a wikked deth him take; Him hadde lever asondre shake, And late his limes asondre ryve, Than leve his richesse in his lyve. He thenkith parte it with no man; Certayn, no love is in him than. How shulde love within him be, Whan in his herte is no pite? That he trespasseth, wel I wat, For ech man knowith his estat; For wel him oughte be reproved That loveth nought, ne is not loved. ‘But sith we arn to Fortune comen, And [han] our sermoun of hir nomen, A wondir wil I telle thee now, Thou herdist never sich oon, I trow. I not wher thou me leven shal, Though sothfastnesse it be [in] al, As it is writen, and is sooth, That unto men more profit doth The froward Fortune and contraire, Than the swote and debonaire: And if thee thinke it is doutable, It is thurgh argument provable. For the debonaire and softe Falsith and bigylith ofte; For liche a moder she can cherishe And milken as doth a norys; And of hir goode to hem deles, And yeveth hem part of her Ioweles, With grete richesse and dignitee; And hem she hoteth stabilitee In a state that is not stable, But chaunging ay and variable; And fedith hem with glorie veyne, And worldly blisse noncerteyne. Whan she hem settith on hir whele, Than wene they to be right wele, And in so stable state withalle, That never they wene for to falle. And whan they set so highe be, They wene to have in certeintee Of hertly frendis [so] gret noumbre, That no-thing mighte her stat encombre; They truste hem so on every syde, Wening with hem they wolde abyde In every perel and mischaunce, Withoute chaunge or variaunce, Bothe of catel and of good; And also for to spende hir blood And alle hir membris for to spille, Only to fulfille hir wille. They maken it hole in many wyse, And hoten hem hir ful servyse, How sore that it do hem smerte, Into hir very naked sherte! Herte and al, so hole they yeve, For the tyme that they may live, So that, with her flaterye, They maken foolis glorifye Of hir wordis [greet] speking, And han [there]-of a reioysing, And trowe hem as the Evangyle; And it is al falsheed and gyle, As they shal afterwardes see, Whan they arn falle in povertee, And been of good and catel bare; Than shulde they seen who freendis ware. For of an hundred, certeynly, Nor of a thousand ful scarsly, Ne shal they fynde unnethis oon, Whan povertee is comen upon. For [this] Fortune that I of telle, With men whan hir lust to dwelle, Makith hem to lese hir conisaunce, And nourishith hem in ignoraunce. ‘But froward Fortune and perverse, Whan high estatis she doth reverse, And maketh hem to tumble doun Of hir whele, with sodeyn tourn, And from hir richesse doth hem flee, And plongeth hem in povertee, As a stepmoder envyous, And leyeth a plastre dolorous Unto her hertis, wounded egre, Which is not tempred with vinegre, But with poverte and indigence, For to shewe, by experience, That she is Fortune verely In whom no man shulde affy, Nor in hir yeftis have fiaunce, She is so ful of variaunce. Thus can she maken high and lowe, Whan they from richesse ar[e]n throwe, Fully to knowen, withouten were, Freend of effect, and freend of chere; And which in love weren trew and stable, And whiche also weren variable, After Fortune, hir goddesse, In poverte, outher in richesse; For al [she] yeveth, out of drede, Unhappe bereveth it in dede; For Infortune lat not oon Of freendis, whan Fortune is goon; I mene tho freendis that wol flee Anoon as entreth povertee. And yit they wol not leve hem so, But in ech place where they go They calle hem “wrecche,” scorne and blame, And of hir mishappe hem diffame, And, namely, siche as in richesse Pretendith most of stablenesse, Whan that they sawe him set on-lofte, And weren of him socoured ofte, And most y-holpe in al hir nede: But now they take no maner hede, But seyn, in voice of flaterye, That now apperith hir folye, Over-al where-so they fare, And singe, “Go, farewel feldefare.” Alle suche freendis I beshrewe, For of [the] trewe ther be to fewe; But sothfast freendis, what so bityde, In every fortune wolen abyde; They han hir hertis in suche noblesse That they nil love for no richesse; Nor, for that Fortune may hem sende, They wolen hem socoure and defende; And chaunge for softe ne for sore, For who is freend, loveth evermore. Though men drawe swerd his freend to slo, He may not hewe hir love a-two. But, in [the] case that I shal sey, For pride and ire lese it he may, And for reprove by nycetee, And discovering of privitee, With tonge wounding, as feloun, Thurgh venemous detraccioun. Frend in this case wol gon his way, For no-thing greve him more ne may; And for nought ellis wol he flee, If that he love in stabilitee. And certeyn, he is wel bigoon Among a thousand that fyndith oon. For ther may be no richesse, Ageyns frendship, of worthinesse; For it ne may so high atteigne As may the valoure, sooth to seyne, Of him that loveth trew and wel; Frendship is more than is catel. For freend in court ay better is Than peny in [his] purs, certis; And Fortune, mishapping, Whan upon men she is [falling], Thurgh misturning of hir chaunce, And casteth hem oute of balaunce, She makith, thurgh hir adversitee, Men ful cleerly for to see Him that is freend in existence From him that is by apparence. For Infortune makith anoon To knowe thy freendis fro thy foon, By experience, right as it is; The which is more to preyse, y-wis, Than [is] miche richesse and tresour; For more [doth] profit and valour Poverte, and such adversitee, Bifore than doth prosperitee; For the toon yeveth conisaunce, And the tother ignoraunce. ‘And thus in poverte is in dede Trouthe declared fro falsehede; For feynte frendis it wol declare, And trewe also, what wey they fare. For whan he was in his richesse, These freendis, ful of doublenesse, Offrid him in many wyse Hert and body, and servyse. What wolde he than ha [yeve] to ha bought To knowen openly her thought, That he now hath so clerly seen? The lasse bigyled he sholde have been And he hadde than perceyved it, But richesse nold not late him wit. Wel more avauntage doth him than, Sith that it makith him a wys man, The greet mischeef that he [receyveth], Than doth richesse that him deceyveth. Richesse riche ne makith nought Him that on tresour set his thought; For richesse stont in suffisaunce And no-thing in habundaunce; For suffisaunce al-only Makith men to live richely. For he that hath [but] miches tweyne, Ne [more] value in his demeigne, Liveth more at ese, and more is riche, Than doth he that is [so] chiche, And in his bern hath, soth to seyn, An hundred [muwis] of whete greyn, Though he be chapman or marchaunt, And have of golde many besaunt. For in the geting he hath such wo, And in the keping drede also, And set evermore his bisynesse For to encrese, and not to lesse, For to augment and multiply. And though on hepis [it] lye him by, Yit never shal make his richesse Asseth unto his gredinesse. But the povre that recchith nought, Save of his lyflode, in his thought, Which that he getith with his travaile, He dredith nought that it shal faile, Though he have lytel worldis good, Mete and drinke, and esy food, Upon his travel and living, And also suffisaunt clothing. Or if in syknesse that he falle, And lothe mete and drink withalle, Though he have nought, his mete to by, He shal bithinke him hastely, To putte him out of al daunger, That he of mete hath no mister; Or that he may with litel eke Be founden, whyl that he is seke; Or that men shul him bere in hast, To live, til his syknesse be past, To somme maysondewe bisyde; He cast nought what shal him bityde. He thenkith nought that ever he shal Into any syknesse falle. ‘And though it falle, as it may be, That al betyme spare shal he As mochel as shal to him suffyce, Whyl he is syke in any wyse, He doth [it], for that he wol be Content with his povertee Withoute nede of any man. So miche in litel have he can, He is apayed with his fortune; And for he nil be importune Unto no wight, ne onerous, Nor of hir goodes coveitous; Therfore he spareth, it may wel been, His pore estat for to sustene. ‘Or if him lust not for to spare, But suffrith forth, as nought ne ware, Atte last it hapneth, as it may, Right unto his laste day, And taketh the world as it wolde be; For ever in herte thenkith he, The soner that [the] deeth him slo, To paradys the soner go He shal, there for to live in blisse, Where that he shal no good misse. Thider he hopith god shal him sende Aftir his wrecchid lyves ende. Pictagoras himsilf reherses, In a book that the Golden Verses Is clepid, for the nobilitee Of the honourable ditee:— “Than, whan thou gost thy body fro, Free in the eir thou shalt up go, And leven al humanitee, And purely live in deitee.”— He is a fool, withouten were, That trowith have his countre here. “In erthe is not our countree,” That may these clerkis seyn and see In Boece of Consolacioun, Where it is maked mencioun Of our countree pleyn at the eye, By teching of philosophye, Where lewid men might lere wit, Who-so that wolde translaten it. If he be sich that can wel live Aftir his rente may him yive, And not desyreth more to have, That may fro povertee him save: A wys man seide, as we may seen, Is no man wrecched, but he it wene, Be he king, knight, or ribaud. And many a ribaud is mery and baud, That swinkith, and berith, bothe day and night, Many a burthen of gret might, The whiche doth him lasse offense, For he suffrith in pacience. They laugh and daunce, trippe and singe, And ley not up for her living, But in the tavern al dispendith The winning that god hem sendith. Than goth he, fardels for to bere, With as good chere as he dide ere; To swinke and traveile he not feynith, For for to robben he disdeynith; But right anoon, aftir his swinke, He goth to tavern for to drinke. Alle these ar riche in abundaunce, That can thus have suffisaunce Wel more than can an usurere, As god wel knowith, withoute were. For an usurer, so god me see, Shal never for richesse riche bee, But evermore pore and indigent, Scarce, and gredy in his entent. ‘For soth it is, whom it displese, Ther may no marchaunt live at ese, His herte in sich a were is set, That it quik brenneth [more] to get, Ne never shal [enough have] geten; Though he have gold in gerners yeten, For to be nedy he dredith sore. Wherfore to geten more and more He set his herte and his desire; So hote he brennith in the fire Of coveitise, that makith him wood To purchase other mennes good. He undirfongith a gret peyne, That undirtakith to drinke up Seyne; For the more he drinkith, ay The more he leveth, the soth to say. [This is the] thurst of fals geting, That last ever in coveiting, And the anguisshe and distresse With the fire of gredinesse. She fighteth with him ay, and stryveth, That his herte asondre ryveth; Such gredinesse him assaylith, That whan he most hath, most he faylith. ‘Phisiciens and advocates Gon right by the same yates; They selle hir science for winning, And haunte hir crafte for greet geting. Hir winning is of such swetnesse, That if a man falle in sikenesse, They are ful glad, for hir encrese; For by hir wille, withoute lees, Everiche man shulde be seke, And though they dye, they set not a leke. After, whan they the gold have take, Ful litel care for hem they make. They wolde that fourty were seke at onis, Ye, two hundred, in flesh and bonis, And yit two thousand, as I gesse, For to encresen her richesse. They wol not worchen, in no wyse, But for lucre and coveityse; For fysyk ginneth first by fy, The fysycien also sothely; And sithen it goth fro fy to sy; To truste on hem, it is foly; For they nil, in no maner gree, Do right nought for charitee. ‘Eke in the same secte are set Alle tho that prechen for to get Worshipes, honour, and richesse. Her hertis arn in greet distresse, That folk [ne] live not holily. But aboven al, specialy, Sich as prechen [for] veynglorie, And toward god have no memorie, But forth as ypocrites trace, And to her soules deth purchace, And outward [shewen] holynesse, Though they be fulle of cursidnesse. Not liche to the apostles twelve, They deceyve other and hem-selve; Bigyled is the gyler than. For preching of a cursed man, Though [it] to other may profyte, Himsilf availeth not a myte; For oft good predicacioun Cometh of evel entencioun. To him not vailith his preching, Al helpe he other with his teching; For where they good ensaumple take, There is he with veynglorie shake. ‘But lat us leven these prechoures, And speke of hem that in her toures Hepe up her gold, and faste shette, And sore theron her herte sette. They neither love god, ne drede; They kepe more than it is nede, And in her bagges sore it binde, Out of the sonne, and of the winde; They putte up more than nede ware, Whan they seen pore folk forfare, For hunger dye, and for cold quake; God can wel vengeaunce therof take. [Thre] gret mischeves hem assailith, And thus in gadring ay travaylith; With moche peyne they winne richesse; And drede hem holdith in distresse, To kepe that they gadre faste; With sorwe they leve it at the laste; With sorwe they bothe dye and live, That to richesse her hertis yive, And in defaute of love it is, As it shewith ful wel, y-wis. For if these gredy, the sothe to seyn, Loveden, and were loved ageyn, And good love regned over-alle, Such wikkidnesse ne shulde falle; But he shulde yeve that most good had To hem that weren in nede bistad, And live withoute fals usure, For charitee ful clene and pure. If they hem yeve to goodnesse, Defending hem from ydelnesse, In al this world than pore noon We shulde finde, I trowe, not oon. But chaunged is this world unstable; For love is over-al vendable. We see that no man loveth now But for winning and for prow; And love is thralled in servage Whan it is sold for avauntage; Yit wommen wol hir bodies selle; Suche soules goth to the devel of helle.’ FRAGMENT C. Whan Love had told hem his entente, The baronage to councel wente; In many sentences they fille, And dyversly they seide hir wille: But aftir discord they accorded, And hir accord to Love recorded. ‘Sir,’ seiden they, ‘we been at oon, By even accord of everichoon, Out-take Richesse al-only, That sworen hath ful hauteynly, That she the castel nil assaile, Ne smyte a stroke in this bataile, With dart, ne mace, spere, ne knyf, For man that speketh or bereth the lyf, And blameth your empryse, y-wis, And from our hoost departed is, (At leeste wey, as in this plyte,) So hath she this man in dispyte; For she seith he ne loved hir never, And therfor she wol hate him ever. For he wol gadre no tresore, He hath hir wrath for evermore. He agilte hir never in other caas, Lo, here al hoolly his trespas! She seith wel, that this other day He asked hir leve to goon the way That is clepid To-moche-Yeving, And spak ful faire in his praying; But whan he prayde hir, pore was he, Therfore she warned him the entree. Ne yit is he not thriven so That he hath geten a peny or two, That quitly is his owne in hold. Thus hath Richesse us alle told; And whan Richesse us this recorded, Withouten hir we been accorded. ‘And we finde in our accordaunce, That False-Semblant and Abstinaunce, With alle the folk of hir bataile, Shulle at the hinder gate assayle, That Wikkid-Tunge hath in keping, With his Normans, fulle of Iangling. And with hem Curtesie and Largesse, That shulle shewe hir hardinesse To the olde wyf that [kepeth] so harde Fair-Welcoming within her warde. Than shal Delyte and Wel-Helinge Fonde Shame adoun to bringe; With al hir hoost, erly and late, They shulle assailen [thilke] gate. Agaynes Drede shal Hardinesse Assayle, and also Sikernesse, With al the folk of hir leding, That never wist what was fleing. ‘Fraunchyse shal fighte, and eek Pitee, With Daunger ful of crueltee. Thus is your hoost ordeyned wel; Doun shal the castel every del, If everiche do his entente, So that Venus be presente, Your modir, ful of vassalage, That can y-nough of such usage; Withouten hir may no wight spede This werk, neither for word ne dede. Therfore is good ye for hir sende, For thurgh hir may this werk amende.’ Amour. ‘Lordinges, my modir, the goddesse, That is my lady, and my maistresse, Nis not [at] al at my willing, Ne doth not al my desyring. Yit can she som-tyme doon labour, Whan that hir lust, in my socour, [Al my nedis] for to acheve, But now I thenke hir not to greve. My modir is she, and of child-hede I bothe worshipe hir, and eek drede; For who that dredith sire ne dame Shal it abye in body or name. And, natheles, yit cunne we Sende aftir hir, if nede be; And were she nigh, she comen wolde, I trowe that no-thing might hir holde. ‘My modir is of greet prowesse; She hath tan many a forteresse, That cost hath many a pound er this, Ther I nas not present, y-wis; And yit men seide it was my dede; But I come never in that stede; Ne me ne lykith, so mote I thee, Such toures take withoute me. For-why me thenketh that, in no wyse, It may ben cleped but marchandise. ‘Go bye a courser, blak or whyte, And pay therfor; than art thou quyte. The marchaunt oweth thee right nought, Ne thou him, whan thou [hast] it bought. I wol not selling clepe yeving, For selling axeth no guerdoning; Here lyth no thank, ne no meryte, That oon goth from that other al quyte. But this selling is not semblable; For, whan his hors is in the stable, He may it selle ageyn, pardee, And winne on it, such hap may be; Al may the man not lese, y-wis, For at the leest the skin is his. Or elles, if it so bityde That he wol kepe his hors to ryde, Yit is he lord ay of his hors. But thilke chaffare is wel wors, There Venus entremeteth nought; For who-so such chaffare hath bought, He shal not worchen so wysly, That he ne shal lese al outerly Bothe his money and his chaffare; But the seller of the ware The prys and profit have shal. Certeyn, the byer shal lese al; For he ne can so dere it bye To have lordship and ful maistrye, Ne have power to make letting Neither for yift ne for preching, That of his chaffare, maugre his, Another shal have as moche, y-wis, If he wol yeve as moche as he, Of what contrey so that he be; Or for right nought, so happe may, If he can flater hir to hir pay. Ben than suche marchaunts wyse? No, but fooles in every wyse, Whan they bye such thing wilfully, Ther-as they lese her good [fully]. But natheles, this dar I saye, My modir is not wont to paye, For she is neither so fool ne nyce, To entremete hir of sich vyce. But truste wel, he shal paye al, That repente of his bargeyn shal, Whan Poverte put him in distresse, Al were he scoler to Richesse, That is for me in gret yerning, Whan she assenteth to my willing. ‘But, [by] my modir seint Venus, And by hir fader Saturnus, That hir engendrid by his lyf, But not upon his weddid wyf! Yit wol I more unto you swere, To make this thing the seurere; Now by that feith, and that leautee I owe to alle my brethren free, Of which ther nis wight under heven That can her fadris names neven, So dyvers and so many ther be That with my modir have be privee! Yit wolde I swere, for sikirnesse, The pole of helle to my witnesse, Now drinke I not this yeer clarree, If that I lye, or forsworn be! (For of the goddes the usage is, That who-so him forswereth amis, Shal that yeer drinke no clarree). Now have I sworn y-nough, pardee; If I forswere me, than am I lorn, But I wol never be forsworn. Sith Richesse hath me failed here, She shal abye that trespas dere, At leeste wey, but [she] hir arme With swerd, or sparth, or gisarme. For certes, sith she loveth not me, Fro thilke tyme that she may see The castel and the tour to-shake, In sory tyme she shal awake. If I may grype a riche man, I shal so pulle him, if I can, That he shal, in a fewe stoundes, Lese alle his markes and his poundes. I shal him make his pens outslinge, But-[if] they in his gerner springe; Our maydens shal eek plukke him so, That him shal neden fetheres mo, And make him selle his lond to spende, But he the bet cunne him defende. ‘Pore men han maad hir lord of me; Although they not so mighty be, That they may fede me in delyt, I wol not have hem in despyt. No good man hateth hem, as I gesse, For chinche and feloun is Richesse, That so can chase hem and dispyse, And hem defoule in sondry wyse. They loven ful bet, so god me spede, Than doth the riche, chinchy grede, And been, in good feith, more stable And trewer, and more serviable; And therfore it suffysith me Hir goode herte, and hir leautee. They han on me set al hir thought, And therfore I forgete hem nought. I wolde hem bringe in greet noblesse, If that I were god of Richesse, As I am god of Love, sothly, Such routhe upon hir pleynt have I. Therfore I must his socour be, That peyneth him to serven me; For if he deyde for love of this, Than semeth in me no love ther is.’ ‘Sir,’ seide they, ‘sooth is, every del, That ye reherce, and we wot wel Thilk oth to holde is resonable; For it is good and covenable, That ye on riche men han sworn. For, sir, this wot we wel biforn; If riche men doon you homage, That is as fooles doon outrage; But ye shul not forsworen be, Ne let therfore to drinke clarree, Or piment maked fresh and newe. Ladyes shulle hem such pepir brewe, If that they falle into hir laas, That they for wo mowe seyn “Allas!” Ladyes shuln ever so curteis be, That they shal quyte your oth al free. Ne seketh never other vicaire, For they shal speke with hem so faire That ye shal holde you payed ful wel, Though ye you medle never a del. Lat ladies worche with hir thinges, They shal hem telle so fele tydinges, And moeve hem eke so many requestis By flatery, that not honest is, And therto yeve hem such thankinges, What with kissing, and with talkinges, That certes, if they trowed be, Shal never leve hem lond ne fee That it nil as the moeble fare, Of which they first delivered are. Now may ye telle us al your wille, And we your hestes shal fulfille. ‘But Fals-Semblant dar not, for drede Of you, sir, medle him of this dede, For he seith that ye been his fo; He not, if ye wol worche him wo. Wherfore we pray you alle, beausire, That ye forgive him now your ire, And that he may dwelle, as your man, With Abstinence, his dere lemman: This our accord and our wil now.’ ‘Parfay,’ seide Love, ‘I graunte it yow; I wol wel holde him for my man; Now lat him come:’ and he forth ran. ‘Fals-Semblant,’ quod Love, ‘in this wyse I take thee here to my servyse, That thou our freendis helpe alway, And hindre hem neithir night ne day, But do thy might hem to releve, And eek our enemies that thou greve. Thyn be this might, I graunt it thee, My king of harlotes shalt thou be; We wol that thou have such honour. Certeyn, thou art a fals traitour, And eek a theef; sith thou were born, A thousand tyme thou art forsworn. But, natheles, in our hering, To putte our folk out of douting, I bid thee teche hem, wostow how? By somme general signe now, In what place thou shalt founden be, If that men had mister of thee; And how men shal thee best espye, For thee to knowe is greet maistrye; Tel in what place is thyn haunting.’ F. Sem. ‘Sir, I have fele dyvers woning, That I kepe not rehersed be, So that ye wolde respyten me. For if that I telle you the sothe, I may have harm and shame bothe. If that my felowes wisten it, My tales shulden me be quit; For certeyn, they wolde hate me, If ever I knewe hir cruelte; For they wolde over-al holde hem stille Of trouthe that is ageyn hir wille; Suche tales kepen they not here. I might eftsone bye it ful dere, If I seide of hem any thing, That ought displeseth to hir hering. For what word that hem prikke or byteth, In that word noon of hem delyteth, Al were it gospel, the evangyle, That wolde reprove hem of hir gyle, For they are cruel and hauteyn. And this thing wot I wel, certeyn, If I speke ought to peire hir loos, Your court shal not so wel be cloos, That they ne shal wite it atte last. Of good men am I nought agast, For they wol taken on hem nothing, Whan that they knowe al my mening; But he that wol it on him take, He wol himself suspecious make, That he his lyf let covertly, In Gyle and in Ipocrisy, That me engendred and yaf fostring.’ ‘They made a ful good engendring,’ Quod Love, ‘for who-so soothly telle, They engendred the devel of helle! ‘But nedely, how-so-ever it be,’ Quod Love, ‘I wol and charge thee, To telle anoon thy woning-places, Hering ech wight that in this place is; And what lyf that thou livest also, Hyde it no lenger now; wherto? Thou most discover al thy wurching, How thou servest, and of what thing, Though that thou shuldest for thy soth-sawe Ben al to-beten and to-drawe; And yit art thou not wont, pardee. But natheles, though thou beten be, Thou shalt not be the first, that so Hath for soth-sawe suffred wo.’ F. Sem. ‘Sir, sith that it may lyken you, Though that I shulde be slayn right now, I shal don your comaundement, For therto have I gret talent.’ Withouten wordes mo, right than, Fals-Semblant his sermon bigan, And seide hem thus in audience:— ‘Barouns, tak hede of my sentence! That wight that list to have knowing Of Fals-Semblant, ful of flatering, He must in worldly folk him seke, And, certes, in the cloistres eke; I wone no-where but in hem tweye; But not lyk even, sooth to seye; Shortly, I wol herberwe me There I hope best to hulstred be; And certeynly, sikerest hyding Is undirneth humblest clothing. ‘Religious folk ben ful covert; Seculer folk ben more appert. But natheles, I wol not blame Religious folk, ne hem diffame, In what habit that ever they go: Religioun humble, and trewe also, Wol I not blame, ne dispyse, But I nil love it, in no wyse. I mene of fals religious, That stoute ben, and malicious; That wolen in an abit go, And setten not hir herte therto. ‘Religious folk ben al pitous; Thou shalt not seen oon dispitous. They loven no pryde, ne no stryf, But humbly they wol lede hir lyf; With swich folk wol I never be. And if I dwelle, I feyne me I may wel in her abit go; But me were lever my nekke atwo, Than lete a purpose that I take, What covenaunt that ever I make. I dwelle with hem that proude be, And fulle of wyles and subtelte; That worship of this world coveyten, And grete nedes cunne espleyten; And goon and gadren greet pitaunces, And purchace hem the acqueyntaunces Of men that mighty lyf may leden; And feyne hem pore, and hem-self feden With gode morcels delicious, And drinken good wyn precious, And preche us povert and distresse, And fisshen hem-self greet richesse With wyly nettis that they caste: It wol come foul out at the laste. They ben fro clene religioun went; They make the world an argument That hath a foul conclusioun. “I have a robe of religioun, Than am I al religious:” This argument is al roignous; It is not worth a croked brere; Habit ne maketh monk ne frere, But clene lyf and devocioun Maketh gode men of religioun. Nathelesse, ther can noon answere, How high that ever his heed he shere With rasour whetted never so kene, That Gyle in braunches cut thrittene; Ther can no wight distincte it so, That he dar sey a word therto. ‘But what herberwe that ever I take, Or what semblant that ever I make, I mene but gyle, and folowe that; For right no mo than Gibbe our cat [Fro myce and rattes went his wyle], Ne entende I [not] but to begyle; Ne no wight may, by my clothing, Wite with what folk is my dwelling; Ne by my wordis yet, pardee, So softe and so plesaunt they be. Bihold the dedis that I do; But thou be blind, thou oughtest so; For, varie hir wordis fro hir dede, They thenke on gyle, withouten drede, What maner clothing that they were, Or what estat that ever they bere, Lered or lewd, lord or lady, Knight, squier, burgeis, or bayly.’ Right thus whyl Fals-Semblant sermoneth, Eftsones Love him aresoneth, And brak his tale in the speking As though he had him told lesing; And seide: ‘What, devel, is that I here? What folk hast thou us nempned here? May men finde religioun In worldly habitacioun?’ F. Sem. ‘Ye, sir; it foloweth not that they Shulde lede a wikked lyf, parfey, Ne not therfore her soules lese, That hem to worldly clothes chese; For, certis, it were gret pitee. Men may in seculer clothes see Florisshen holy religioun. Ful many a seynt in feeld and toun, With many a virgin glorious, Devout, and ful religious, Had deyed, that comun clothe ay beren, Yit seyntes never-the-les they weren. I coude reken you many a ten; Ye, wel nigh alle these holy wimmen, That men in chirchis herie and seke, Bothe maydens, and these wyves eke, That baren many a fair child here, Wered alwey clothis seculere, And in the same dyden they, That seyntes weren, and been alwey. The eleven thousand maydens dere, That beren in heven hir ciergis clere, Of which men rede in chirche, and singe, Were take in seculer clothing, Whan they resseyved martirdom, And wonnen heven unto her hoom. Good herte makith the gode thought; The clothing yeveth ne reveth nought. The gode thought and the worching, That maketh religioun flowring, Ther lyth the good religioun Aftir the right entencioun. ‘Who-so toke a wethers skin, And wrapped a gredy wolf therin, For he shulde go with lambis whyte, Wenest thou not he wolde hem byte? Yis! never-the-las, as he were wood, He wolde hem wery, and drinke the blood; And wel the rather hem disceyve, For, sith they coude not perceyve His treget and his crueltee, They wolde him folowe, al wolde he flee. ‘If ther be wolves of sich hewe Amonges these apostlis newe, Thou, holy chirche, thou mayst be wayled! Sith that thy citee is assayled Thourgh knightis of thyn owne table, God wot thy lordship is doutable! If they enforce [hem] it to winne, That shulde defende it fro withinne, Who might defence ayens hem make? Withouten stroke it mot be take Of trepeget or mangonel; Without displaying of pensel. And if god nil don it socour, But lat [hem] renne in this colour, Thou moost thyn heestis laten be. Than is ther nought, but yelde thee, Or yeve hem tribute, doutelees, And holde it of hem to have pees: But gretter harm bityde thee, That they al maister of it be. Wel conne they scorne thee withal; By day stuffen they the wal, And al the night they mynen there. Nay, thou most planten elleswhere Thyn impes, if thou wolt fruyt have; Abyd not there thy-self to save. ‘But now pees! here I turne ageyn; I wol no more of this thing seyn, If I may passen me herby; I mighte maken you wery. But I wol heten you alway To helpe your freendis what I may, So they wollen my company; For they be shent al-outerly But-if so falle, that I be Oft with hem, and they with me. And eek my lemman mot they serve, Or they shul not my love deserve. Forsothe, I am a fals traitour; God iugged me for a theef trichour; Forsworn I am, but wel nygh non Wot of my gyle, til it be don. ‘Thourgh me hath many oon deth resseyved, That my treget never aperceyved; And yit resseyveth,and shal resseyve, That my falsnesse never aperceyve: But who-so doth, if he wys be, Him is right good be war of me. But so sligh is the [deceyving That to hard is the] aperceyving. For Protheus, that coude him chaunge In every shap, hoomly and straunge, Coude never sich gyle ne tresoun As I; for I com never in toun Ther-as I mighte knowen be, Though men me bothe might here and see. Ful wel I can my clothis chaunge, Take oon, and make another straunge. Now am I knight, now chasteleyn; Now prelat, and now chapeleyn; Now prest, now clerk, and now forstere; Now am I maister, now scolere; Now monk, now chanoun, now baily; What-ever mister man am I. Now am I prince, now am I page, And can by herte every langage. Som-tyme am I hoor and old; Now am I yong, [and] stout, and bold; Now am I Robert, now Robyn; Now frere Menour,now Iacobyn; And with me folweth my loteby, To don me solas and company, That hight dame Abstinence-Streyned, In many a queynt array [y]-feyned. Right as it cometh to hir lyking, I fulfille al hir desiring. Somtyme a wommans cloth take I; Now am I mayde, now lady. Somtyme I am religious; Now lyk an anker in an hous. Somtyme am I prioresse, And now a nonne, and now abbesse; And go thurgh alle regiouns, Seking alle religiouns. But to what ordre that I am sworn, I take the strawe, and lete the corn; To [blynde] folk [ther] I enhabite, I axe no-more but hir abite. What wol ye more? in every wyse, Right as me list, I me disgyse. Wel can I bere me under weed; Unlyk is my word to my deed. Thus make I in my trappis falle, Thurgh my pryvileges, alle That ben in Cristendom alyve. I may assoile, and I may shryve, That no prelat may lette me, Al folk, wher-ever they founde be: I noot no prelat may don so, But it the pope be, and no mo, That made thilk establisshing. Now is not this a propre thing? But, were my sleightis aperceyved, [Ne shulde I more been receyved] As I was wont; and wostow why? For I dide hem a tregetry; But therof yeve I litel tale, I have the silver and the male; So have I preched and eek shriven, So have I take, so have [me] yiven, Thurgh hir foly, husbond and wyf, That I lede right a Ioly lyf, Thurgh simplesse of the prelacye; They know not al my tregetrye. ‘But for as moche as man and wyf Shuld shewe hir paroche-prest hir lyf Ones a yeer, as seith the book, Er any wight his housel took, Than have I pryvilegis large, That may of moche thing discharge; For he may seye right thus, pardee:— “Sir Preest,in shrift I telle it thee, That he, to whom that I am shriven, Hath me assoiled, and me yiven Penaunce soothly, for my sinne, Which that I fond me gilty inne; Ne I ne have never entencioun To make double confessioun, Ne reherce eft my shrift to thee; O shrift is right y-nough to me. This oughte thee suffyce wel, Ne be not rebel never-a-del; For certis, though thou haddest it sworn, I wot no prest ne prelat born That may to shrift eft me constreyne. And if they don, I wol me pleyne; For I wot where to pleyne wel. Thou shalt not streyne me a del, Ne enforce me, ne [yit] me trouble, To make my confessioun double. Ne I have none affeccioun To have double absolucioun. The firste is right y-nough to me; This latter assoiling quyte I thee. I am unbounde; what mayst thou finde More of my sinnes me to unbinde? For he, that might hath in his hond, Of alle my sinnes me unbond. And if thou wolt me thus constreyne, That me mot nedis on thee pleyne, There shal no Iugge imperial, Ne bisshop, ne official, Don Iugement on me; for I Shal gon and pleyne me openly Unto my shrift-fadir newe, (That hight not Frere Wolf untrewe!) And he shal chevise him for me, For I trowe he can hampre thee. But, lord! he wolde be wrooth withalle, If men him wolde Frere Wolf calle! For he wolde have no pacience, But don al cruel vengeaunce! He wolde his might don at the leest, [Ne] no-thing spare for goddis heest. And, god so wis be my socour, But thou yeve me my Saviour At Ester, whan it lyketh me, Withoute presing more on thee, I wol forth, and to him goon, And he shal housel me anoon, For I am out of thy grucching; I kepe not dele with thee nothing.” Thus may he shryve him, that forsaketh His paroche-prest, and to me taketh. And if the prest wol him refuse, I am ful redy him to accuse, And him punisshe and hampre so, That he his chirche shal forgo. ‘But who-so hath in his feling The consequence of such shryving, Shal seen that prest may never have might To knowe the conscience aright Of him that is under his cure. And this ageyns holy scripture, That biddeth every herde honeste Have verry knowing of his beste. But pore folk that goon by strete, That have no gold, ne sommes grete, Hem wolde I lete to her prelates, Or lete hir prestis knowe hir states, For to me right nought yeve they.’ Amour. ‘And why is it?’ F. Sem. ‘For they ne may. They ben so bare, I take no keep; But I wol have the fatte sheep;— Lat parish prestis have the lene, I yeve not of hir harm a bene! And if that prelats grucchen it, That oughten wroth be in hir wit, To lese her fatte bestes so, I shal yeve hem a stroke or two, That they shal lesen with [the] force, Ye, bothe hir mytre and hir croce. Thus Iape I hem, and have do longe, My priveleges been so stronge.’ Fals-Semblant wolde have stinted here, But Love ne made him no such chere That he was wery of his sawe; But for to make him glad and fawe, He seide:—‘Tel on more specialy, How that thou servest untrewly. Tel forth, and shame thee never a del; For as thyn abit shewith wel, Thou [semest] an holy heremyte.’ F. Sem. ‘Soth is, but I am an ypocryte.’ Amour. ‘Thou gost and prechest povertee?’ F. Sem. ‘Ye, sir; but richesse hath poustee.’ Amour. ‘Thou prechest abstinence also?’ F. Sem. ‘Sir, I wol fillen, so mote I go, My paunche of gode mete and wyne, As shulde a maister of divyne; For how that I me pover feyne, Yit alle pore folk I disdeyne. ‘I love bet the acqueyntaunce Ten tymes, of the king of Fraunce, Than of pore man of mylde mode, Though that his soule be also gode. For whan I see beggers quaking, Naked on mixens al stinking, For hungre crye, and eek for care, I entremete not of hir fare. They been so pore, and ful of pyne, They might not ones yeve me dyne, For they have no-thing but hir lyf; What shulde he yeve that likketh his knyf? It is but foly to entremete, To seke in houndes nest fat mete. Let bere hem to the spitel anoon, But, for me, comfort gete they noon. But a riche sike usurere Wolde I visyte and drawe nere; Him wol I comforte and rehete, For I hope of his gold to gete. And if that wikked deth him have, I wol go with him to his grave. And if ther any reprove me, Why that I lete the pore be, Wostow how I [mot] ascape? I sey, and swerë him ful rape, That riche men han more tecches Of sinne, than han pore wrecches, And han of counseil more mister; And therfore I wol drawe hem ner. But as gret hurt, it may so be, Hath soule in right gret poverte, As soul in gret richesse, forsothe, Al-be-it that they hurten bothe. For richesse and mendicitees Ben cleped two extremitees; The mene is cleped suffisaunce, Ther lyth of vertu the aboundaunce. For Salamon, ful wel I woot, In his Parables us wroot, As it is knowe of many a wight, In his [thrittethe] chapitre right: “God, thou me kepe, for thy poustee, Fro richesse and mendicitee; For if a riche man him dresse To thenke to moche on [his] richesse, His herte on that so fer is set, That he his creatour foryet; And him, that [begging] wol ay greve, How shulde I by his word him leve? Unnethe that he nis a micher, Forsworn, or elles [god is] lyer.” Thus seith Salamones sawes; Ne we finde writen in no lawes, And namely in our Cristen lay— (Who seith “ye,” I dar sey “nay”)— That Crist, ne his apostlis dere, Whyl that they walkede in erthe here, Were never seen her bred begging, For they nolde beggen for nothing. And right thus were men wont to teche; And in this wyse wolde it preche The maistres of divinitee Somtyme in Paris the citee. ‘And if men wolde ther-geyn appose The naked text, and lete the glose, It mighte sone assoiled be; For men may wel the sothe see, That, parde, they mighte axe a thing Pleynly forth, without begging. For they weren goddis herdis dere, And cure of soules hadden here, They nolde no-thing begge hir fode; For aftir Crist was don on rode, With [hir] propre hondis they wrought, And with travel, and elles nought, They wonnen al hir sustenaunce, And liveden forth in hir penaunce, And the remenaunt [yeve] awey To other pore folk alwey. They neither bilden tour ne halle, But [leye] in houses smale withalle. A mighty man, that can and may, Shulde with his honde and body alway Winne him his food in laboring, If he ne have rent or sich a thing, Although he be religious, And god to serven curious. Thus mote he don, or do trespas, But-if it be in certeyn cas, That I can reherce, if mister be, Right wel, whan the tyme I see. ‘Seke the book of Seynt Austin, Be it in paper or perchemin, There-as he writ of these worchinges, Thou shalt seen that non excusinges A parfit man ne shulde seke By wordis, ne by dedis eke, Although he be religious, And god to serven curious, That he ne shal, so mote I go, With propre hondis and body also, Gete his food in laboring, If he ne have propretee of thing. Yit shulde he selle al his substaunce, And with his swink have sustenaunce, If he be parfit in bountee. Thus han tho bookes tolde me: For he that wol gon ydilly, And useth it ay besily To haunten other mennes table, He is a trechour, ful of fable; Ne he ne may, by gode resoun, Excuse him by his orisoun. For men bihoveth, in som gyse, Som-tyme [leven] goddes servyse To gon and purchasen her nede. Men mote eten, that is no drede, And slepe, and eek do other thing; So longe may they leve praying. So may they eek hir prayer blinne, While that they werke, hir mete to winne. Seynt Austin wol therto accorde, In thilke book that I recorde. Justinian eek, that made lawes, Hath thus forboden, by olde dawes, “No man, up peyne to be deed, Mighty of body, to begge his breed, If he may swinke, it for to gete; Men shulde him rather mayme or bete, Or doon of him apert Iustice, Than suffren him in such malice.” They don not wel, so mote I go, That taken such almesse so, But if they have som privelege, That of the peyne hem wol allege. But how that is, can I not see, But-if the prince disseyved be; Ne I ne wene not, sikerly, That they may have it rightfully. But I wol not determyne Of princes power, ne defyne, Ne by my word comprende, y-wis, If it so fer may strecche in this. I wol not entremete a del; But I trowe that the book seith wel, Who that taketh almesses, that be Dewe to folk that men may see Lame, feble, wery, and bare, Pore, or in such maner care, (That conne winne hem nevermo, For they have no power therto), He eteth his owne dampning, But-if he lye, that made al thing. And if ye such a truaunt finde, Chastise him wel, if ye be kinde. But they wolde hate you, percas, And, if ye fillen in hir laas, They wolde eftsones do you scathe, If that they mighte, late or rathe; For they be not ful pacient, That han the world thus foule blent. And witeth wel, [wher] that god bad The good man selle al that he had, And folowe him, and to pore it yive, He wolde not therfore that he live To serven him in mendience, For it was never his sentence; But he bad wirken whan that nede is, And folwe him in goode dedis. Seynt Poule, that loved al holy chirche, He bade thapostles for to wirche, And winnen hir lyflode in that wyse, And hem defended truaundyse, And seide, “Wirketh with your honden;” Thus shulde the thing be undirstonden. He nolde, y-wis, bidde hem begging, Ne sellen gospel, ne preching, Lest they berafte, with hir asking, Folk of hir catel or of hir thing. For in this world is many a man That yeveth his good, for he ne can Werne it for shame, or elles he Wolde of the asker delivered be; And, for he him encombreth so, He yeveth him good to late him go: But it can him no-thing profyte, They lese the yift and the meryte. The goode folk, that Poule to preched, Profred him ofte, whan he hem teched, Som of hir good in charite; But therof right no-thing took he; But of his hondwerk wolde he gete Clothes to wryen him, and his mete.’ Amour. ‘Tel me than how a man may liven, That al his good to pore hath yiven, And wol but only bidde his bedis, And never with honde laboure his nedis: May he do so?’ F. Sem. ‘Ye, sir.’ Amour. ‘And how?’ F. Sem. ‘Sir, I wol gladly telle yow:— Seynt Austin seith, a man may be In houses that han propretee, As templers and hospitelers, And as these chanouns regulers, Or whyte monkes, or these blake— (I wole no mo ensamplis make)— And take therof his sustening, For therinne lyth no begging; But other-weyes not, y-wis, [If] Austin gabbeth not of this. And yit ful many a monk laboureth, That god in holy chirche honoureth; For whan hir swinking is agoon, They rede and singe in chirche anoon. ‘And for ther hath ben greet discord, As many a wight may bere record, Upon the estate of mendience, I wol shortly, in your presence, Telle how a man may begge at nede, That hath not wherwith him to fede, Maugre his felones Iangelinges, For sothfastnesse wol non hidinges; And yit, percas, I may abey, That I to yow sothly thus sey. ‘Lo, here the caas especial: If a man be so bestial That he of no craft hath science, And nought desyreth ignorence, Than may he go a-begging yerne, Til he som maner craft can lerne, Thurgh which, withoute truaunding, He may in trouthe have his living. Or if he may don no labour, For elde, or syknesse, or langour, Or for his tendre age also, Than may he yit a-begging go. ‘Or if he have, peraventure, Thurgh usage of his noriture, Lived over deliciously, Than oughten good folk comunly Han of his mischeef som pitee, And suffren him also, that he May gon aboute and begge his breed, That he be not for hungur deed. Or if he have of craft cunning, And strengthe also, and desiring To wirken, as he hadde what, But he finde neither this ne that, Than may he begge, til that he Have geten his necessitee. ‘Or if his winning be so lyte, That his labour wol not acquyte Sufficiantly al his living, Yit may he go his breed begging; Fro dore to dore he may go trace, Til he the remenaunt may purchace. Or if a man wolde undirtake Any empryse for to make, In the rescous of our lay, And it defenden as he may, Be it with armes or lettrure, Or other covenable cure, If it be so he pore be, Than may he begge, til that he May finde in trouthe for to swinke, And gete him clothes, mete, and drinke. Swinke he with hondis corporel, And not with hondis espirituel. ‘In al thise caas, and in semblables, If that ther ben mo resonables, He may begge, as I telle you here, And elles nought, in no manere; As William Seynt Amour wolde preche, And ofte wolde dispute and teche Of this matere alle openly At Paris ful solempnely. And al-so god my soule blesse, As he had, in this stedfastnesse, The accord of the universitee, And of the puple, as semeth me. ‘No good man oughte it to refuse, Ne oughte him therof to excuse, Be wrooth or blythe who-so be; For I wol speke, and telle it thee, Al shulde I dye, and be put doun, As was seynt Poul, in derk prisoun; Or be exiled in this caas With wrong, as maister William was, That my moder Ypocrisye Banisshed for hir greet envye. ‘My moder flemed him, Seynt Amour: This noble dide such labour To susteyne ever the loyaltee, That he to moche agilte me. He made a book, and leet it wryte, Wherin his lyf he dide al wryte, And wolde ich reneyed begging, And lived by my traveyling, If I ne had rent ne other good. What? wened he that I were wood? For labour might me never plese, I have more wil to been at ese; And have wel lever, sooth to sey, Bifore the puple patre and prey, And wrye me in my foxerye Under a cope of papelardye.’ Quod Love, ‘What devel is this I here? What wordis tellest thou me here?’ F. Sem. ‘What, sir?’ Amour. ‘Falsnesse, that apert is; Than dredist thou not god?’ F. Sem. ‘No, certis: For selde in greet thing shal he spede In this world, that god wol drede. For folk that hem to vertu yiven, And truly on her owne liven, And hem in goodnesse ay contene, On hem is litel thrift y-sene; Such folk drinken gret misese; That lyf [ne] may me never plese. But see what gold han usurers, And silver eek in [hir] garners, Taylagiers, and these monyours, Bailifs, bedels, provost, countours; These liven wel nygh by ravyne; The smale puple hem mote enclyne, And they as wolves wol hem eten. Upon the pore folk they geten Ful moche of that they spende or kepe; Nis none of hem that he nil strepe, And wryen him-self wel atte fulle; Withoute scalding they hem pulle. The stronge the feble overgoth; But I, that were my simple cloth, Robbe bothe robbed and robbours, And gyle gyled and gylours. By my treget, I gadre and threste The greet tresour into my cheste, That lyth with me so faste bounde. Myn highe paleys do I founde, And my delytes I fulfille With wyne at feestes at my wille, And tables fulle of entremees; I wol no lyf, but ese and pees, And winne gold to spende also. For whan the grete bagge is go, It cometh right with my Iapes. Make I not wel tumble myn apes? To winne is alwey myn entent; My purchas is better than my rent; For though I shulde beten be, Over-al I entremete me; Withoute me may no wight dure. I walke soules for to cure. Of al the worlde cure have I In brede and lengthe; boldely I wol bothe preche and eek counceilen; With hondis wille I not traveilen, For of the pope I have the bulle; I ne holde not my wittes dulle. I wol not stinten, in my lyve, These emperouris for to shryve, Or kyngis, dukis, and lordis grete; But pore folk al quyte I lete. I love no such shryving, pardee, But it for other cause be. I rekke not of pore men, Hir astate is not worth an hen. Where fyndest thou a swinker of labour Have me unto his confessour? But emperesses, and duchesses, Thise quenes, and eek [thise] countesses, Thise abbesses, and eek Bigyns, These grete ladyes palasyns, These Ioly knightes, and baillyves, Thise nonnes, and thise burgeis wyves, That riche been, and eek plesing, And thise maidens welfaring, Wher-so they clad or naked be, Uncounceiled goth ther noon fro me. And, for her soules savetee, At lord and lady, and hir meynee, I axe, whan they hem to me shryve, The propretee of al hir lyve, And make hem trowe, bothe meest and leest, Hir paroch-prest nis but a beest Ayens me and my company, That shrewis been as greet as I; For whiche I wol not hyde in hold No privetee that me is told, That I by word or signe, y-wis, [Nil] make hem knowe what it is, And they wolen also tellen me; They hele fro me no privitee. And for to make yow hem perceyven, That usen folk thus to disceyven, I wol you seyn, withouten drede, What men may in the gospel rede Of Seynt Mathew, the gospelere, That seith, as I shal you sey here. ‘Upon the chaire of Moyses— Thus is it glosed, douteles: That is the olde testament, For therby is the chaire ment— Sitte Scribes and Pharisen;— That is to seyn, the cursid men Whiche that we ypocritis calle— Doth that they preche, I rede you alle, But doth not as they don a del, That been not wery to seye wel, But to do wel, no wille have they; And they wolde binde on folk alwey, That ben to [be] begyled able, Burdens that ben importable; On folkes shuldres thinges they couchen That they nil with her fingres touchen.’ Amour. ‘And why wol they not touche it?’ F. Sem. ‘Why? For hem ne list not, sikirly; For sadde burdens that men taken Make folkes shuldres aken. And if they do ought that good be, That is for folk it shulde see: Her burdens larger maken they, And make hir hemmes wyde alwey, And loven setes at the table, The firste and most honourable; And for to han the first chaieris In synagoges, to hem ful dere is; And willen that folk hem loute and grete, Whan that they passen thurgh the strete, And wolen be cleped “Maister” also. But they ne shulde not willen so; The gospel is ther-ageyns, I gesse: That sheweth wel hir wikkidnesse. ‘Another custom use we:— Of hem that wol ayens us be, We hate hem deedly everichoon, And we wol werrey hem, as oon. Him that oon hatith, hate we alle, And coniecte how to doon him falle. And if we seen him winne honour, Richesse or preys, thurgh his valour, Provende, rent, or dignitee, Ful fast, y-wis, compassen we By what ladder he is clomben so; And for to maken him doun to go, With traisoun we wole him defame, And doon him lese his gode name. Thus from his ladder we him take, And thus his freendis foes we make; But word ne wite shal he noon, Til alle his freendis been his foon. For if we dide it openly, We might have blame redily; For hadde he wist of our malyce, He hadde him kept, but he were nyce. ‘Another is this, that, if so falle That ther be oon among us alle That doth a good turn, out of drede, We seyn it is our alder dede. Ye, sikerly, though he it feyned, Or that him list, or that him deyned A man thurgh him avaunced be; Therof alle parceners be we, And tellen folk, wher-so we go, That man thurgh us is sprongen so. And for to have of men preysing, We purchace, thurgh our flatering, Of riche men, of gret poustee, Lettres, to witnesse our bountee; So that man weneth, that may us see, That alle vertu in us be. And alwey pore we us feyne; But how so that we begge or pleyne, We ben the folk, without lesing, That al thing have without having. Thus be we dred of the puple, y-wis. And gladly my purpos is this:— I dele with no wight, but he Have gold and tresour gret plentee; Hir acqueyntaunce wel love I; This is moche my desyr, shortly. I entremete me of brocages, I make pees and mariages, I am gladly executour, And many tymes procuratour; I am somtyme messager; That falleth not to my mister. And many tymes I make enquestes; For me that office not honest is; To dele with other mennes thing, That is to me a gret lyking. And if that ye have ought to do In place that I repeire to, I shal it speden thurgh my wit, As sone as ye have told me it. So that ye serve me to pay, My servyse shal be your alway. But who-so wol chastyse me, Anoon my love lost hath he; For I love no man in no gyse, That wol me repreve or chastyse; But I wolde al folk undirtake, And of no wight no teching take; For I, that other folk chastye, Wol not be taught fro my folye. ‘I love noon hermitage more; Alle desertes, and holtes hore, And grete wodes everichoon, I lete hem to the Baptist Iohan. I quethe him quyte, and him relesse Of Egipt al the wildirnesse; To fer were alle my mansiouns Fro alle citees and goode tounes. My paleis and myn hous make I There men may renne in openly, And sey that I the world forsake. But al amidde I bilde and make My hous, and swimme and pley therinne Bet than a fish doth with his finne. ‘Of Antecristes men am I, Of whiche that Crist seith openly, They have abit of holinesse, And liven in such wikkednesse. Outward, lambren semen we, Fulle of goodnesse and of pitee, And inward we, withouten fable, Ben gredy wolves ravisable. We enviroune bothe londe and see; With al the world werreyen we; We wol ordeyne of alle thing, Of folkes good, and her living. ‘If ther be castel or citee Wherin that any bougerons be, Although that they of Milayne were, For ther-of ben they blamed there: Or if a wight, out of mesure, Wolde lene his gold, and take usure, For that he is so coveitous: Or if he be to leccherous, Or [thefe, or] haunte simonye; Or provost, ful of trecherye, Or prelat, living Iolily, Or prest that halt his quene him by; Or olde hores hostilers, Or other bawdes or bordillers, Or elles blamed of any vyce, Of whiche men shulden doon Iustyce: By alle the seyntes that we pray, But they defende hem with lamprey, With luce, with elis, with samons, With tendre gees, and with capons, With tartes, or with cheses fat, With deynte flawnes, brode and flat, With caleweys, or with pullaille, With coninges, or with fyn vitaille, That we, undir our clothes wyde, Maken thurgh our golet glyde: Or but he wol do come in haste Roo-venisoun, [y]-bake in paste: Whether so that he loure or groine, He shal have of a corde a loigne, With whiche men shal him binde and lede, To brenne him for his sinful dede, That men shulle here him crye and rore A myle-wey aboute, and more.

But, and he couthe thurgh his sleight Do maken up a tour of height, Nought roughte I whether of stone or tree, Or erthe, or turves though it be, Though it were of no vounde stone, Wrought with squyre and scantilone, So that the tour were stuffed wel With alle richesse temporel; And thanne, that he wolde updresse Engyns, bothe more and lesse, To caste at us, by every syde— To bere his goode name wyde— Such sleightes [as] I shal yow nevene, Barelles of wyne, by sixe or sevene, Or gold in sakkes gret plente, He shulde sone delivered be. And if he have noon sich pitaunces, Late him study in equipolences, And lete lyes and fallaces, If that he wolde deserve our graces; Or we shal bere him such witnesse Of sinne, and of his wrecchidnesse, And doon his loos so wyde renne, That al quik we shulde him brenne, Or elles yeve him suche penaunce, That is wel wors than the pitaunce. ‘For thou shalt never, for nothing, Con knowen aright by her clothing The traitours fulle of echerye, But thou her werkis can aspye. And ne hadde the good keping be Whylom of the universitee, That kepeth the key of Cristendome, [They] had been turmented, alle and some. Suche been the stinking [fals] prophetis; Nis non of hem, that good prophete is; For they, thurgh wikked entencioun, The yeer of the incarnacioun A thousand and two hundred yeer, Fyve and fifty, ferther ne ner, Broughten a book, with sory grace, To yeven ensample in comune place, That seide thus, though it were fable:— “This is the Gospel Perdurable, That fro the Holy Goost is sent.” Wel were it worth to ben [y]-brent. Entitled was in such manere This book, of which I telle here. Ther nas no wight in al Parys, Biforn Our Lady, at parvys, That [he] ne mighte bye the book, To copy, if him talent took. Ther might he see, by greet tresoun, Ful many fals comparisoun:— “As moche as, thurgh his grete might, Be it of hete, or of light, The sunne sourmounteth the mone, That troubler is, and chaungeth sone, And the note-kernel the shelle— (I scorne nat that I yow telle)— Right so, withouten any gyle, Sourmounteth this noble Evangyle The word of any evangelist.” And to her title they token Christ; And many such comparisoun, Of which I make no mencioun, Might men in that boke finde, Who-so coude of hem have minde. ‘The universitee, that tho was aslepe, Gan for to braide, and taken kepe; And at the noys the heed up-caste, Ne never sithen slepte it faste, But up it sterte, and armes took Ayens this fals horrible book, Al redy bateil for to make, And to the Iuge the book to take. But they that broughten the book there Hente it anoon awey, for fere; They nolde shewe it more a del, But thenne it kepte, and kepen wil, Til such a tyme that they may see That they so stronge woxen be, That no wight may hem wel withstonde; For by that book they durst not stonde. Away they gonne it for to bere, For they ne durste not answere By exposicioun ne glose To that that clerkis wole appose Ayens the cursednesse, y-wis, That in that boke writen is. Now wot I not, ne I can not see What maner ende that there shal be Of al this [boke] that they hyde; But yit algate they shal abyde Til that they may it bet defende; This trowe I best, wol be hir ende. ‘Thus Antecrist abyden we, For we ben alle of his meynee; And what man that wol not be so, Right sone he shal his lyf forgo. We wol a puple on him areyse, And thurgh our gyle doon him seise, And him on sharpe speris ryve, Or other-weyes bringe him fro lyve, But-if that he wol folowe, y-wis, That in our boke writen is. Thus moche wol our book signifye, That whyl [that] Peter hath maistrye, May never Iohan shewe wel his might. ‘Now have I you declared right The mening of the bark and rinde That makith the entenciouns blinde. But now at erst I wol biginne To expowne you the pith withinne:— [And first, by Peter, as I wene, The Pope himself we wolden mene,] And [eek] the seculers comprehende, That Cristes lawe wol defende, And shulde it kepen and mayntenen Ayeines hem that al sustenen, And falsly to the puple techen. [And] Iohan bitokeneth hem [that] prechen, That ther nis lawe covenable But thilke Gospel Perdurable, That fro the Holy Gost was sent To turne folk that been miswent. The strengthe of Iohan they undirstonde The grace in which, they seye, they stonde, That doth the sinful folk converte, And hem to Iesus Crist reverte. ‘Ful many another horriblete May men in that boke see, That ben comaunded, douteles, Ayens the lawe of Rome expres; And alle with Antecrist they holden, As men may in the book biholden. And than comaunden they to sleen Alle tho that with Peter been; But they shal nevere have that might, And, god toforn, for stryf to fight, That they ne shal y-nough [men] finde That Peters lawe shal have in minde, And ever holde, and so mayntene, That at the last it shal be sene That they shal alle come therto, For ought that they can speke or do. And thilke lawe shal not stonde, That they by Iohan have undirstonde; But, maugre hem, it shal adoun, And been brought to confusioun. But I wol stinte of this matere, For it is wonder long to here; But hadde that ilke book endured, Of better estate I were ensured; And freendis have I yit, pardee, That han me set in greet degree. ‘Of all this world is emperour Gyle my fader, the trechour, And emperesse my moder is, Maugre the Holy Gost, y-wis. Our mighty linage and our route Regneth in every regne aboute; And wel is worth we [maistres] be, For al this world governe we, And can the folk so wel disceyve, That noon our gyle can perceyve; And though they doon, they dar not saye; The sothe dar no wight biwreye. But he in Cristis wrath him ledeth, That more than Crist my bretheren dredeth. He nis no ful good champioun, That dredith such similacioun; Nor that for peyne wole refusen Us to correcten and accusen. He wol not entremete by right, Ne have god in his eye-sight, And therfore god shal him punyce; But me ne rekketh of no vyce, Sithen men us loven comunably, And holden us for so worthy, That we may folk repreve echoon, And we nil have repref of noon. Whom shulden folk worshipen so But us, that stinten never mo To patren whyl that folk us see, Though it not so bihinde hem be? ‘And where is more wood folye, Than to enhaunce chivalrye, And love noble men and gay, That Ioly clothis weren alway? If they be sich folk as they semen, So clene, as men her clothis demen, And that her wordis folowe her dede, It is gret pite, out of drede, For they wol be noon ypocritis! Of hem, me thinketh [it] gret spite is; I can not love hem on no syde. But Beggers with these hodes wyde, With sleighe and pale faces lene, And greye clothis not ful clene, But fretted ful of tatarwagges, And highe shoes, knopped with dagges, That frouncen lyke a quaile-pype, Or botes riveling as a gype; To such folk as I you devyse Shuld princes and these lordes wyse Take alle her londes and her thinges, Bothe werre and pees, in governinges; To such folk shulde a prince him yive, That wolde his lyf in honour live. And if they be not as they seme, That serven thus the world to queme, There wolde I dwelle, to disceyve The folk, for they shal not perceyve. ‘But I ne speke in no such wyse, That men shulde humble abit dispyse, So that no pryde ther-under be. No man shulde hate, as thinketh me, The pore man in sich clothing. But god ne preiseth him no-thing, That seith he hath the world forsake, And hath to worldly glorie him take, And wol of siche delyces use; Who may that Begger wel excuse? That papelard, that him yeldeth so, And wol to worldly ese go, And seith that he the world hath left, And gredily it grypeth eft, He is the hound, shame is to seyn, That to his casting goth ageyn. ‘But unto you dar I not lye: But mighte I felen or aspye, That ye perceyved it no-thing, Ye shulden have a stark lesing Right in your hond thus, to biginne, I nolde it lette for no sinne.’ The god lough at the wonder tho, And every wight gan laughe also, And seide:—‘Lo here a man aright For to be trusty to every wight!’ ‘Fals Semblant,’ quod Love, ‘sey to me, Sith I thus have avaunced thee, That in my court is thy dwelling, And of ribaudes shalt be my king, Wolt thou wel holden my forwardis?’ F. Sem. ‘Ye, sir, from hennes forewardis; Hadde never your fader herebiforn Servaunt so trewe, sith he was born.’ Amour. ‘That is ayeines al nature.’ F. Sem. ‘Sir, put you in that aventure; For though ye borowes take of me, The sikerer shal ye never be For ostages, ne sikirnesse, Or chartres, for to bere witnesse. I take your-self to record here, That men ne may, in no manere, Teren the wolf out of his hyde, Til he be [flayn], bak and syde, Though men him bete and al defyle; What? wene ye that I wole bigyle? For I am clothed mekely, Ther-under is al my trechery; Myn herte chaungeth never the mo For noon abit, in which I go. Though I have chere of simplenesse, I am not weary of shrewednesse. My lemman, Streyned-Abstinence, Hath mister of my purveaunce; She hadde ful longe ago be deed, Nere my councel and my reed; Lete hir allone, and you and me.’ And Love answerde, ‘I truste thee Withoute borowe, for I wol noon.’ And Fals-Semblant, the theef, anoon, Right in that ilke same place, That hadde of tresoun al his face Right blak withinne, and whyt withoute, Thanketh him, gan on his knees loute. Than was ther nought, but ‘Every man Now to assaut, that sailen can,’ Quod Love, ‘and that ful hardily.’ Than armed they hem communly Of sich armour as to hem fel. Whan they were armed, fers and fel, They wente hem forth, alle in a route, And set the castel al aboute; They wil nought away, for no drede, Til it so be that they ben dede, Or til they have the castel take. And foure batels they gan make, And parted hem in foure anoon, And toke her way, and forth they goon, The foure gates for to assaile, Of whiche the kepers wol not faile; For they ben neither syke ne dede, But hardy folk, and stronge in dede. Now wole I seyn the countenaunce Of Fals-Semblant, and Abstinaunce, That ben to Wikkid-Tonge went. But first they helde her parlement, Whether it to done were To maken hem be knowen there, Or elles walken forth disgysed. But at the laste they devysed, That they wold goon in tapinage, As it were in a pilgrimage, Lyk good and holy folk unfeyned. And Dame Abstinence-Streyned Took on a robe of camelyne, And gan hir graithe as a Begyne. A large coverchief of threde She wrapped al aboute hir hede, But she forgat not hir sautere; A peire of bedis eek she bere Upon a lace, al of whyt threde, On which that she hir bedes bede; But she ne boughte hem never a del, For they were geven her, I wot wel, God wot, of a ful holy frere, That seide he was hir fader dere, To whom she hadde ofter went Than any frere of his covent. And he visyted hir also, And many a sermoun seide hir to; He nolde lette, for man on lyve, That he ne wolde hir ofte shryve. And with so gret devocion They maden her confession, That they had ofte, for the nones, Two hedes in one hood at ones. Of fair shape I devyse her thee, But pale of face somtyme was she; That false traitouresse untrewe Was lyk that salowe hors of hewe, That in the Apocalips is shewed, That signifyeth tho folk beshrewed, That been al ful of trecherye, And pale, thurgh hypocrisye; For on that hors no colour is, But only deed and pale, y-wis. Of suche a colour enlangoured Was Abstinence, y-wis, coloured; Of her estat she her repented, As her visage represented. She had a burdoun al of Thefte, That Gyle had yeve her of his yefte; And a scrippe of Fainte Distresse, That ful was of elengenesse, And forth she walked sobrely: And False-Semblant saynt, ie vous die, [Had], as it were for such mistere, Don on the cope of a frere, With chere simple, and ful pitous; His looking was not disdeinous, Ne proud, but meke and ful pesible. About his nekke he bar a bible, And squierly forth gan he gon; And, for to reste his limmes upon, He had of Treson a potente; As he were feble, his way he wente. But in his sleve he gan to thringe A rasour sharp, and wel bytinge, That was forged in a forge, Which that men clepen Coupegorge. So longe forth hir way they nomen, Til they to Wicked-Tonge comen, That at his gate was sitting, And saw folk in the way passing. The pilgrimes saw he faste by, That beren hem ful mekely, And humblely they with him mette. Dame Abstinence first him grette, And sith him False-Semblant salued, And he hem; but he not remued, For he ne dredde hem not a-del. For when he saw hir faces wel, Alway in herte him thoughte so, He shulde knowe hem bothe two; For wel he knew Dame Abstinaunce But he ne knew not Constreynaunce. He knew nat that she was constrayned, Ne of her theves lyfe feyned, But wende she com of wil al free; But she com in another degree; And if of good wil she began, That wil was failed her [as] than. And Fals-Semblant had he seyn als, But he knew nat that he was fals. Yet fals was he, but his falsnesse Ne coude he not espye, nor gesse; For semblant was so slye wrought, That falsnesse he ne espyed nought. But haddest thou knowen him beforn, Thou woldest on a boke have sworn, Whan thou him saugh in thilke aray That he, that whylom was so gay, And of the daunce Ioly Robin, Was tho become a Iacobin. But sothely, what so men him calle, Freres Prechours been good men alle; Hir order wickedly they beren, Suche minstrelles if [that] they weren. So been Augustins and Cordileres, And Carmes, and eek Sakked Freres, And alle freres, shodde and bare, (Though some of hem ben grete and square) Ful holy men, as I hem deme; Everich of hem wolde good man seme. But shalt thou never of apparence Seen conclude good consequence In none argument, y-wis, If existence al failed is. For men may finde alway sophyme The consequence to envenyme, Who-so that hath the subteltee The double sentence for to see. Whan the pilgrymes commen were To Wicked-Tonge, that dwelled there, Hir harneis nigh hem was algate; By Wicked-Tonge adoun they sate, That bad hem ner him for to come, And of tydinges telle him some, And sayde hem:—‘What cas maketh yow To come into this place now?’ ‘Sir,’ seyde Strained-Abstinaunce, ‘We, for to drye our penaunce, With hertes pitous and devoute, Are commen, as pilgrimes gon aboute; Wel nigh on fote alway we go; Ful dusty been our heles two; And thus bothe we ben sent Thurghout this world that is miswent, To yeve ensample, and preche also. To fisshen sinful men we go, For other fisshing ne fisshe we. And, sir, for that charitee, As we be wont, herberwe we crave, Your lyf to amende; Crist it save! And, so it shulde you nat displese, We wolden, if it were your ese, A short sermoun unto you seyn.’ And Wikked-Tonge answerde ageyn, ‘The hous,’ quod he, ‘such as ye see, Shal nat be warned you for me, Sey what you list, and I wol here.’ ‘Graunt mercy, swete sire dere!’ Quod alderfirst Dame Abstinence, And thus began she hir sentence: Const. Abstinence. ‘Sir, the first vertue, certeyn, The gretest, and most sovereyn That may be founde in any man, For having, or for wit he can, That is, his tonge to refreyne; Therto ought every wight him peyne. For it is better stille be Than for to speken harm, pardee! And he that herkeneth it gladly, He is no good man, sikerly. And, sir, aboven al other sinne, In that art thou most gilty inne. Thou spake a Iape not long ago, (And, sir, that was right yvel do) Of a yong man that here repaired, And never yet this place apaired. Thou seydest he awaited nothing But to disceyve Fair-Welcoming. Ye seyde nothing sooth of that; But, sir, ye lye; I tell you plat; He ne cometh no more, ne goth, pardee! I trow ye shal him never see. Fair-Welcoming in prison is, That ofte hath pleyed with you, er this, The fairest games that he coude, Withoute filthe, stille or loude; Now dar [he] nat [him]self solace. Ye han also the man do chace, That he dar neither come ne go. What meveth you to hate him so But properly your wikked thought, That many a fals lesing hath thought? That meveth your foole eloquence, That iangleth ever in audience, And on the folk areyseth blame, And doth hem dishonour and shame, For thing that may have no preving, But lyklinesse, and contriving. For I dar seyn, that Reson demeth, It is not al sooth thing that semeth, And it is sinne to controve Thing that is [for] to reprove; This wot ye wel; and, sir, therefore Ye arn to blame [wel] the more. And, nathelesse, he rekketh lyte; He yeveth nat now thereof a myte; For if he thoughte harm, parfay, He wolde come and gon al day; He coude him-selfe nat abstene. Now cometh he nat, and that is sene, For he ne taketh of it no cure, But-if it be through aventure, And lasse than other folk, algate. And thou here watchest at the gate, With spere in thyne arest alway; There muse, musard, al the day. Thou wakest night and day for thought; Y-wis, thy traveyl is for nought. And Ielousye, withouten faile, Shal never quyte thee thy travaile. And scathe is, that Fair-Welcoming, Withouten any trespassing, Shal wrongfully in prison be, Ther wepeth and languissheth he. And though thou never yet, y-wis, Agiltest man no more but this, (Take not a-greef) it were worthy To putte thee out of this baily, And afterward in prison lye, And fettre thee til that thou dye; For thou shalt for this sinne dwelle Right in the devils ers of helle, But-if that thou repente thee.’ ‘Ma fay, thou lyest falsly!’ quod he. ‘What? welcome with mischaunce now! Have I therfore herbered you To seye me shame, and eek reprove? With sory happe, to your bihove, Am I to-day your herbergere! Go, herber you elleswhere than here, That han a lyer called me! Two tregetours art thou and he, That in myn hous do me this shame, And for my soth-sawe ye me blame. Is this the sermoun that ye make? To alle the develles I me take, Or elles, god, thou me confounde! But er men diden this castel founde, It passeth not ten dayes or twelve, But it was told right to my-selve, And as they seide, right so tolde I, He kiste the Rose privily! Thus seide I now, and have seid yore; I not wher he dide any more. Why shulde men sey me such a thing, If it hadde been gabbing? Right so seide I, and wol seye yit; I trowe, I lyed not of it; And with my bemes I wol blowe To alle neighboris a-rowe, How he hath bothe comen and gon.’ Tho spak Fals-Semblant right anon, ‘Al is not gospel, out of doute, That men seyn in the toune aboute; Ley no deef ere to my speking; I swere yow, sir, it is gabbing! I trowe ye wot wel certeynly, That no man loveth him tenderly That seith him harm, if he wot it, Al be he never so pore of wit. And sooth is also sikerly, (This knowe ye, sir, as wel as I), That lovers gladly wol visyten The places ther hir loves habyten. This man you loveth and eek honoureth; This man to serve you laboureth; And clepeth you his freend so dere, And this man maketh you good chere, And every-wher that [he] you meteth, He you saleweth, and he you greteth. He preseth not so ofte, that ye Ought of his come encombred be; Ther presen other folk on yow Ful ofter than [that] he doth now. And if his herte him streyned so Unto the Rose for to go, Ye shulde him seen so ofte nede, That ye shulde take him with the dede. He coude his coming not forbere, Though ye him thrilled with a spere; It nere not thanne as it is now. But trusteth wel, I swere it yow, That it is clene out of his thought. Sir, certes, he ne thenketh it nought; No more ne doth Fair-Welcoming, That sore abyeth al this thing. And if they were of oon assent, Ful sone were the Rose hent; The maugre youres wolde be. And sir, of o thing herkeneth me:— Sith ye this man, that loveth yow, Han seid such harm and shame now, Witeth wel, if he gessed it, Ye may wel demen in your wit, He nolde no-thing love you so, Ne callen you his freend also, But night and day he [wolde] wake, The castel to destroye and take, If it were sooth as ye devyse; Or som man in som maner wyse Might it warne him everydel, Or by him-self perceyven wel; For sith he might not come and gon As he was whylom wont to don, He might it sone wite and see; But now al other-wyse [doth] he. Than have [ye], sir, al-outerly Deserved helle, and Iolyly The deth of helle douteles, That thrallen folk so gilteles.’ Fals-Semblant proveth so this thing That he can noon answering, And seeth alwey such apparaunce, That nygh he fel in repentaunce, And seide him:—‘Sir, it may wel be. Semblant, a good man semen ye; And, Abstinence, ful wyse ye seme; Of o talent you bothe I deme. What counceil wole ye to me yeven?’ F. Sem. ‘Right here anoon thou shalt be shriven, And sey thy sinne withoute more; Of this shalt thou repente sore; For I am preest, and have poustee To shryve folk of most dignitee That been, as wyde as world may dure. Of al this world I have the cure, And that had never yit persoun, No vicarie of no maner toun. And, god wot, I have of thee A thousand tymes more pitee Than hath thy preest parochial, Though he thy freend be special. I have avauntage, in o wyse, That your prelates ben not so wyse Ne half so lettred as am I. I am licenced boldely In divinitee to rede, And to confessen, out of drede. If ye wol you now confesse, And leve your sinnes more and lesse, Without abood, knele doun anon, And you shal have absolucion.’ Explicit. THE MINOR POEMS. I. AN A. B. C. Incipit carmen secundum ordinem literarum Alphabeti. Almighty and al merciable quene, To whom that al this world fleeth for socour, To have relees of sinne, sorwe and tene, Glorious virgine, of alle floures flour, To thee I flee, confounded in errour! Help and releve, thou mighty debonaire, Have mercy on my perilous langour! Venquisshed me hath my cruel adversaire. Bountee so fix hath in thyn herte his tente, That wel I wot thou wolt my socour be, Thou canst not warne him that, with good entente, Axeth thyn help. Thyn herte is ay so free, Thou art largesse of pleyn felicitee, Haven of refut, of quiete and of reste. Lo, how that theves seven chasen me! Help, lady bright, er that my ship to-breste! Comfort is noon, but in yow, lady dere, For lo, my sinne and my confusioun, Which oughten not in thy presence appere, Han take on me a grevous accioun Of verrey right and desperacioun; And, as by right, they mighten wel sustene That I were worthy my dampnacioun, Nere mercy of you, blisful hevene quene. Doute is ther noon, thou queen of misericorde, That thou nart cause of grace and mercy here; God vouched sauf thurgh thee with us tacorde. For certes, Cristes blisful moder dere, Were now the bowe bent in swich manere, As it was first, of Iustice and of yre, The rightful God nolde of no mercy here; But thurgh thee han we grace, as we desyre. Ever hath myn hope of refut been in thee, For heer-biforn ful ofte, in many a wyse, Hast thou to misericorde receyved me. But mercy, lady, at the grete assyse, Whan we shul come bifore the hye Iustyse! So litel fruit shal thanne in me be founde, That, but thou er that day me wel chastyse, Of verrey right my werk me wol confounde. Fleeing, I flee for socour to thy tente Me for to hyde from tempest ful of drede, Biseching you that ye you not absente, Though I be wikke. O help yit at this nede! Al have I been a beste in wille and dede, Yit, lady, thou me clothe with thy grace. Thyn enemy and myn—lady, tak hede, Un-to my deth in poynt is me to chace. Glorious mayde and moder, which that never Were bitter, neither in erthe nor in see, But ful of swetnesse and of mercy ever, Help that my fader be not wroth with me! Spek thou, for I ne dar not him y-see. So have I doon in erthe, allas ther-whyle! That certes, but-if thou my socour be, To stink eterne he wol my gost exyle. He vouched sauf, tel him, as was his wille, Bicome a man, to have our alliaunce, And with his precious blood he wroot the bille Up-on the crois, as general acquitaunce, To every penitent in ful creaunce; And therfor, lady bright, thou for us praye. Than shalt thou bothe stinte al his grevaunce, And make our foo to failen of his praye. I wot it wel, thou wolt ben our socour, Thou art so ful of bountee, in certeyn. For, whan a soule falleth in errour, Thy pitee goth and haleth him ayeyn. Than makest thou his pees with his sovereyn, And bringest him out of the crooked strete. Who-so thee loveth he shal not love in veyn, That shal he finde, as he the lyf shal lete. Kalenderes enlumined ben they That in this world ben lighted with thy name, And who-so goth to you the righte wey, Him thar not drede in soule to be lame. Now, queen of comfort, sith thou art that same To whom I seche for my medicyne, Lat not my foo no more my wounde entame, Myn hele in-to thyn hand al I resigne. Lady, thy sorwe can I not portreye Under the cros, ne his grevous penaunce. But, for your bothes peynes, I you preye, Lat not our alder foo make his bobaunce, That he hath in his listes of mischaunce Convict that ye bothe have bought so dere. As I seide erst, thou ground of our substaunce, Continue on us thy pitous eyen clere! Moises, that saugh the bush with flaumes rede Brenninge, of which ther never a stikke brende, Was signe of thyn unwemmed maidenhede. Thou art the bush on which ther gan descende The Holy Gost, the which that Moises wende Had ben a-fyr; and this was in figure. Now lady, from the fyr thou us defende Which that in helle eternally shal dure. Noble princesse, that never haddest pere, Certes, if any comfort in us be, That cometh of thee, thou Cristes moder dere, We han non other melodye or glee Us to reioyse in our adversitee, Ne advocat noon that wol and dar so preye For us, and that for litel hyre as ye, That helpen for an Ave-Marie or tweye. O verrey light of eyen that ben blinde, O verrey lust of labour and distresse, O tresorere of bountee to mankinde, Thee whom God chees to moder for humblesse! From his ancille he made thee maistresse Of hevene and erthe, our bille up for to bede. This world awaiteth ever on thy goodnesse, For thou ne failest never wight at nede. Purpos I have sum tyme for tenquere, Wherfore and why the Holy Gost thee soughte, Whan Gabrielles vois cam to thyn ere. He not to werre us swich a wonder wroughte, But for to save us that he sithen boughte. Than nedeth us no wepen us for to save, But only ther we did not, as us oughte, Do penitence, and mercy axe and have. Queen of comfort, yit whan I me bithinke That I agilt have bothe, him and thee, And that my soule is worthy for to sinke, Allas, I, caitif, whider may I flee? Who shal un-to thy sone my mene be? Who, but thy-self, that art of pitee welle? Thou hast more reuthe on our adversitee Than in this world mighte any tunge telle. Redresse me, moder, and me chastyse, For, certeynly, my fadres chastisinge That dar I nought abyden in no wyse: So hidous is his rightful rekeninge. Moder, of whom our mercy gan to springe, Beth ye my Iuge and eek my soules leche; For ever in you is pitee haboundinge To ech that wol of pitee you biseche. Soth is, that God ne graunteth no pitee With-oute thee; for God, of his goodnesse, Foryiveth noon, but it lyke un-to thee. He hath thee maked vicaire and maistresse Of al the world, and eek governeresse Of hevene, and he represseth his Iustyse After thy wille, and therefore in witnesse He hath thee crouned in so ryal wyse. Temple devout, ther god hath his woninge. Fro which these misbileved pryved been, To you my soule penitent I bringe. Receyve me! I can no ferther fleen! With thornes venimous, O hevene queen, For which the erthe acursed was ful yore, I am so wounded, as ye may wel seen, That I am lost almost;—it smert so sore. Virgine, that art so noble of apparaile, And ledest us in-to the hye tour Of Paradys, thou me wisse and counsaile, How I may have thy grace and thy socour; Al have I been in filthe and in errour. Lady, un-to that court thou me aiourne That cleped is thy bench, O fresshe flour! Ther-as that mercy ever shal soiourne. Xristus, thy sone, that in this world alighte, Up-on the cros to suffre his passioun, And eek, that Longius his herte pighte, And made his herte blood to renne adoun; And al was this for my salvacioun; And I to him am fals and eek unkinde, And yit he wol not my dampnacioun— This thanke I you, socour of al mankinde. Ysaac was figure of his deeth, certeyn, That so fer-forth his fader wolde obeye That him ne roughte no-thing to be slayn; Right so thy sone list, as a lamb, to deye. Now lady, ful of mercy, I you preye, Sith he his mercy mesured so large, Be ye not skant; for alle we singe and seye That ye ben from vengeaunce ay our targe. Zacharie you clepeth the open welle To wasshe sinful soule out of his gilt. Therfore this lessoun oughte I wel to telle That, nere thy tender herte, we weren spilt. Now lady brighte, sith thou canst and wilt Ben to the seed of Adam merciable, So bring us to that palais that is bilt To penitents that ben to mercy able. Amen. Explicit carmen. II. THE COMPLEYNTE UNTO PITE. Pite, that I have sought so yore ago, With herte sore, and ful of besy peyne, That in this world was never wight so wo With-oute dethe; and, if I shal not feyne, My purpos was, to Pite to compleyne Upon the crueltee and tirannye Of Love, that for my trouthe doth me dye. And when that I, by lengthe of certeyn yeres, Had ever in oon a tyme sought to speke, To Pite ran I, al bespreynt with teres, To preyen hir on Crueltee me awreke. But, er I might with any worde out-breke, Or tellen any of my peynes smerte, I fond hir deed, and buried in an herte. Adoun I fel, when that I saugh the herse, Deed as a stoon, whyl that the swogh me laste; But up I roos, with colour ful diverse, And pitously on hir myn yën caste, And ner the corps I gan to presen faste, And for the soule I shoop me for to preye; I nas but lorn; ther nas no more to seye. Thus am I slayn, sith that Pite is deed; Allas! that day! that ever hit shulde falle! What maner man dar now holde up his heed? To whom shal any sorwful herte calle? Now Crueltee hath cast to sleen us alle, In ydel hope, folk redelees of peyne— Sith she is deed—to whom shul we compleyne? But yet encreseth me this wonder newe, That no wight woot that she is deed, but I; So many men as in hir tyme hir knewe, And yet she dyed not so sodeynly; For I have sought hir ever ful besily Sith first I hadde wit or mannes mynde; But she was deed, er that I coude hir fynde. Aboute hir herse ther stoden lustily, Withouten any wo, as thoughte me, Bountee parfit, wel armed and richely, And fresshe Beautee, Lust, and Iolitee, Assured Maner, Youthe, and Honestee, Wisdom, Estaat, [and] Dreed, and Governaunce, Confedred bothe by bonde and alliaunce. A compleynt hadde I, writen, in myn hond, For to have put to Pite as a bille, But whan I al this companye ther fond, That rather wolden al my cause spille Than do me help, I held my pleynte stille; For to that folk, withouten any faile, Withoute Pite may no bille availe. Then leve I al thise virtues, sauf Pite, Keping the corps, as ye have herd me seyn, Confedred alle by bonde of Crueltee, And been assented that I shal be sleyn. And I have put my compleynt up ageyn; For to my foos my bille I dar not shewe, Theffect of which seith thus, in wordes fewe:— The Bille. ‘Humblest of herte, hyest of reverence, Benigne flour, coroune of vertues alle, Sheweth unto your rial excellence Your servaunt, if I durste me so calle, His mortal harm, in which he is y-falle, And noght al only for his evel fare, But for your renoun, as he shal declare. ‘Hit stondeth thus: your contraire, Crueltee, Allyed is ageynst your regalye Under colour of womanly Beautee, For men [ne] shuld not knowe hir tirannye, With Bountee, Gentilesse, and Curtesye, And hath depryved you now of your place That hight “Beautee, apertenant to Grace.” ‘For kyndly, by your heritage right, Ye been annexed ever unto Bountee; And verrayly ye oughte do your might To helpe Trouthe in his adversitee. Ye been also the coroune of Beautee; And certes, if ye wanten in thise tweyne, The world is lore; ther nis no more to seyne. ‘Eek what availeth Maner and Gentilesse Withoute you, benigne creature? Shal Crueltee be your governeresse? Allas! what herte may hit longe endure? Wherfor, but ye the rather take cure To breke that perilous alliaunce, Ye sleen hem that ben in your obeisaunce. ‘And further over, if ye suffre this, Your renoun is fordo than in a throwe; Ther shal no man wite wel what Pite is. Allas! that your renoun shuld be so lowe! Ye be than fro your heritage y-throwe By Crueltee, that occupieth your place; And we despeired, that seken to your grace. ‘Have mercy on me, thou Herenus quene, That you have sought so tenderly and yore; Let som streem of your light on me be sene That love and drede you, ay lenger the more. For, sothly for to seyne, I bere the sore, And, though I be not cunning for to pleyne, For goddes love, have mercy on my peyne! ‘My peyne is this, that what so I desire That have I not, ne no-thing lyk therto; And ever set Desire myn herte on fire; Eek on that other syde, wher-so I go, What maner thing that may encrese wo That have I redy, unsoght, everywhere; Me [ne] lakketh but my deth, and than my bere. ‘What nedeth to shewe parcel of my peyne? Sith every wo that herte may bethinke I suffre, and yet I dar not to you pleyne; For wel I woot, al-though I wake or winke, Ye rekke not whether I flete or sinke. But natheles, my trouthe I shal sustene Unto my deth, and that shal wel be sene. ‘This is to seyne, I wol be youres ever; Though ye me slee by Crueltee, your fo, Algate my spirit shal never dissever Fro your servyse, for any peyne or wo. Sith ye be deed—allas! that hit is so!— Thus for your deth I may wel wepe and pleyne With herte sore and ful of besy peyne.’ Here endeth the exclamacion of the Deth of Pyte. III. THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESSE. The Proem. I have gret wonder, by this lighte, How that I live, for day ne nighte I may nat slepe wel nigh noght; I have so many an ydel thoght Purely for defaute of slepe, That, by my trouthe, I take kepe Of no-thing, how hit cometh or goth, Ne me nis no-thing leef nor loth. Al is y-liche good to me— Ioye or sorowe, wherso hit be— For I have feling in no-thing, But, as it were, a mased thing, Alway in point to falle a-doun; For [sory] imaginacioun Is alway hoolly in my minde. And wel ye wite, agaynes kinde Hit were to liven in this wyse; For nature wolde nat suffyse To noon erthely creature Not longe tyme to endure Withoute slepe, and been in sorwe; And I ne may, ne night ne morwe, Slepe; and thus melancolye, And dreed I have for to dye, Defaute of slepe, and hevinesse Hath sleyn my spirit of quiknesse, That I have lost al lustihede. Suche fantasyes ben in myn hede So I not what is best to do. But men mighte axe me, why so I may not slepe, and what me is? But natheles, who aske this Leseth his asking trewely. My-selven can not telle why The sooth; but trewely, as I gesse, I holdë hit be a siknesse That I have suffred this eight yere, And yet my bote is never the nere; For ther is phisicien but oon, That may me hele; but that is doon. Passe we over until eft; That wil not be, moot nede be left; Our first matere is good to kepe. So whan I saw I might not slepe, Til now late, this other night, Upon my bedde I sat upright, And bad oon reche me a book, A romaunce, and he hit me took To rede aud dryve the night away; For me thoghte it better play Then playen either at chesse or tables. And in this boke were writen fables That clerkes hadde, in olde tyme, And other poets, put in ryme To rede, and for to be in minde Whyl men loved the lawe of kinde. This book ne spak but of such thinges, Of quenes lyves, and of kinges, And many othere thinges smale. Amonge al this I fond a tale That me thoughte a wonder thing. This was the tale: Ther was a king That highte Seys, and hadde a wyf, The beste that mighte bere lyf; And this quene highte Alcyone. So hit befel, therafter sone, This king wolde wenden over see. To tellen shortly, whan that he Was in the see, thus in this wyse, Soche a tempest gan to ryse That brak hir mast, and made it falle, And clefte hir ship, and dreinte hem alle, That never was founden, as it telles, Bord ne man, ne nothing elles. Right thus this king Seys loste his lyf. Now for to speken of his wyf:— This lady, that was left at home, Hath wonder, that the king ne come Hoom, for hit was a longe terme. Anon her herte gan to erme; And for that hir thoughte evermo Hit was not wel [he dwelte] so, She longed so after the king That certes, hit were a pitous thing To telle hir hertely sorwful lyf That hadde, alas! this noble wyf; For him she loved alderbest. Anon she sente bothe eest and west To seke him, but they founde nought. ‘Alas!’ quoth she, ‘that I was wrought! And wher my lord, my love, be deed? Certes, I nil never ete breed, I make a-vowe to my god here, But I mowe of my lorde here!’ Such sorwe this lady to her took That trewely I, which made this book, Had swich pite and swich rowthe To rede hir sorwe, that, by my trowthe, I ferde the worse al the morwe After, to thenken on her sorwe. So whan [she] coude here no word That no man mighte fynde hir lord, Ful oft she swouned, and seide ‘alas!’ For sorwe ful nigh wood she was, Ne she coude no reed but oon; But doun on knees she sat anoon, And weep, that pite was to here. ‘A! mercy! swete lady dere!’ Quod she to Iuno, hir goddesse; ‘Help me out of this distresse, And yeve me grace my lord to see Sone, or wite wher-so he be, Or how he fareth, or in what wyse, And I shal make you sacrifyse, And hoolly youres become I shal With good wil, body, herte, and al; And but thou wilt this, lady swete, Send me grace to slepe, and mete In my slepe som certeyn sweven, Wher-through that I may knowen even Whether my lord be quik or deed.’ With that word she heng doun the heed, And fil a-swown as cold as ston; Hir women caughte her up anon, And broghten hir in bed al naked, And she, forweped and forwaked, Was wery, and thus the dede sleep Fil on her, or she toke keep, Through Iuno, that had herd hir bone, That made hir [for] to slepe sone; For as she prayde, so was don, In dede; for Iuno, right anon, Called thus her messagere To do her erande, and he com nere. Whan he was come, she bad him thus: ‘Go bet,’ quod Iuno, ‘to Morpheus, Thou knowest him wel, the god of sleep; Now understond wel, and tak keep. Sey thus on my halfe, that he Go faste into the grete see, And bid him that, on alle thing, He take up Seys body the king, That lyth ful pale and no-thing rody. Bid him crepe into the body, Aud do it goon to Alcyone The quene, ther she lyth alone, And shewe hir shortly, hit is no nay, How hit was dreynt this other day; And do the body speke so Right as hit was wont to do, The whyles that hit was on lyve. Go now faste, and hy thee blyve!’ This messager took leve and wente Upon his wey, and never ne stente Til he com to the derke valeye That stant bytwene roches tweye, Ther never yet grew corn ne gras, Ne tree, ne nothing that ought was, Beste, ne man, ne nothing elles, Save ther were a fewe welles Came renning fro the cliffes adoun, That made a deedly sleping soun, And ronnen doun right by a cave That was under a rokke y-grave Amid the valey, wonder depe. Ther thise goddes laye and slepe, Morpheus, and Eclympasteyre, That was the god of slepes heyre, That slepe and did non other werk. This cave was also as derk As helle pit over-al aboute; They had good leyser for to route To envye, who might slepe beste; Some henge hir chin upon hir breste And slepe upright, hir heed y-hed, And some laye naked in hir bed, And slepe whyles the dayes laste. This messager com flying faste, And cryed, ‘O ho! awak anon!’ Hit was for noght; ther herde him non. ‘Awak!’ quod he, ‘who is, lyth there?’ And blew his horn right in hir ere, And cryed ‘awaketh!’ wonder hyë. This god of slepe, with his oon yë Cast up, axed, ‘who clepeth there?’ ‘Hit am I,’ quod this messagere; ‘Iuno bad thou shuldest goon’— And tolde him what he shulde doon As I have told yow here-tofore; Hit is no need reherse hit more; And wente his wey, whan he had sayd. Anon this god of slepe a-brayd Out of his slepe, and gan to goon, And did as he had bede him doon; Took up the dreynte body sone, And bar hit forth to Alcyone, His wyf the quene, ther-as she lay, Right even a quarter before day, And stood right at hir beddes fete, And called hir, right as she hete, By name, and seyde, ‘my swete wyf, Awak! let be your sorwful lyf! For in your sorwe ther lyth no reed; For certes, swete, I nam but deed; Ye shul me never on lyve y-see. But good swete herte, [look] that ye Bury my body, [at whiche] a tyde Ye mowe hit finde the see besyde; And far-wel, swete, my worldes blisse! I praye god your sorwe lisse; To litel whyl our blisse lasteth!’ With that hir eyen up she casteth, And saw noght; ‘[A]!’ quod she, ‘for sorwe!’ And deyed within the thridde morwe. But what she sayde more in that swow I may not telle yow as now, Hit were to longe for to dwelle; My first matere I wil yow telle, Wherfor I have told this thing Of Alcione and Seys the king. For thus moche dar I saye wel, I had be dolven everydel, And deed, right through defaute of sleep, If I nad red and taken keep Of this tale next before: And I wol telle yow wherfore; For I ne might, for bote ne bale, Slepe, or I had red this tale Of this dreynte Seys the king, And of the goddes of sleping. Whan I had red this tale wel, And over-loked hit everydel, Me thoughte wonder if hit were so; For I had never herd speke, or tho, Of no goddes that coude make Men [for] to slepe, ne for to wake; For I ne knew never god but oon. And in my game I sayde anoon— And yet me list right evel to pleye— ‘Rather then that I shulde deye Through defaute of sleping thus, I wolde yive thilke Morpheus, Or his goddesse, dame Iuno, Or som wight elles, I ne roghte who— To make me slepe and have som reste— I wil yive him the alder-beste Yift that ever he abood his lyve, And here on warde, right now, as blyve; If he wol make me slepe a lyte, Of downe of pure dowves whyte I wil yive him a fether-bed, Rayed with golde, and right wel cled In fyn blak satin doutremere, And many a pilow, and every bere Of clothe of Reynes, to slepe softe; Him thar not nede to turnen ofte. And I wol yive him al that falles To a chambre; and al his halles I wol do peynte with pure golde, And tapite hem ful many folde Of oo sute; this shal he have, If I wiste wher were his cave, If he can make me slepe sone, As did the goddesse Alcione. And thus this ilke god, Morpheus, May winne of me mo feës thus Than ever he wan; and to Iuno, That is his goddesse, I shal so do, I trow that she shal holde her payd.’ I hadde unneth that word y-sayd Right thus as I have told hit yow, That sodeynly, I niste how, Swich a lust anoon me took To slepe, that right upon my book I fil aslepe, and therwith even Me mette so inly swete a sweven, So wonderful, that never yit I trowe no man hadde the wit To conne wel my sweven rede; No, not Ioseph, withoute drede, Of Egipte, he that redde so The kinges meting Pharao, No more than coude the leste of us; Ne nat scarsly Macrobeus, (He that wroot al thavisioun That he mette, king Scipioun, The noble man, the Affrican— Swiche mervayles fortuned than) I trowe, a-rede my dremes even. Lo, thus hit was, this was my sweven. The Dream. Me thoughte thus:—that hit was May, And in the dawning ther I lay, Me mette thus, in my bed al naked:— [I] loked forth, for I was waked With smale foules a gret hepe, That had affrayed me out of slepe Through noyse and swetnesse of hir song; And, as me mette, they sate among, Upon my chambre-roof withoute, Upon the tyles, al a-boute, And songen, everich in his wyse, The moste solempne servyse By note, that ever man, I trowe, Had herd; for som of hem song lowe, Som hye, and al of oon acorde. To telle shortly, at oo worde, Was never y-herd so swete a steven, But hit had be a thing of heven;— So mery a soun, so swete entunes, That certes, for the toune of Tewnes, I nolde but I had herd hem singe, For al my chambre gan to ringe Through singing of hir armonye. For instrument nor melodye Was nowher herd yet half so swete, Nor of acorde half so mete; For ther was noon of hem that feyned To singe, for ech of hem him peyned To finde out mery crafty notes; They ne spared not hir throtes. And, sooth to seyn, my chambre was Ful wel depeynted, and with glas Were al the windowes wel y-glased, Ful clere, and nat an hole y-crased, That to beholde hit was gret Ioye. For hoolly al the storie of Troye Was in the glasing y-wroght thus, Of Ector and king Priamus, Of Achilles and Lamedon, Of Medea and of Iason, Of Paris, Eleyne, and Lavyne. And alle the walles with colours fyne Were peynted, bothe text and glose, [Of] al the Romaunce of the Rose. My windowes weren shet echon, And through the glas the sunne shon Upon my bed with brighte bemes, With many glade gilden stremes; And eek the welken was so fair, Blew, bright, clere was the air, And ful atempre, for sothe, hit was; For nother cold nor hoot hit nas, Ne in al the welken was a cloude. And as I lay thus, wonder loude Me thoughte I herde an hunte blowe Tassaye his horn, and for to knowe Whether hit were clere or hors of soune. I herde goinge, up and doune, Men, hors, houndes, and other thing; And al men speken of hunting, How they wolde slee the hert with strengthe, And how the hert had, upon lengthe, So moche embosed, I not now what. Anon-right, whan I herde that, How that they wolde on hunting goon, I was right glad, and up anoon; [I] took my hors, and forth I wente Out of my chambre; I never stente Til I com to the feld withoute: Ther overtook I a gret route Of huntes and eek of foresteres, With many relayes and lymeres, And hyed hem to the forest faste, And I with hem;—so at the laste I asked oon, ladde a lymere:— ‘Say, felow, who shal hunten here Quod I; and he answerde ageyn, ‘Sir, themperour Octovien,’ Quod he, ‘and is heer faste by.’ ‘A goddes halfe, in good tyme,’ quod I, ‘Go we faste!’ and gan to ryde. Whan we came to the forest-syde, Every man dide, right anoon, As to hunting fil to doon. The mayster-hunte anoon, fot-hoot, With a gret horne blew three moot At the uncoupling of his houndes. Within a whyl the hert [y]-founde is, Y-halowed, and rechased faste Longe tyme; and at the laste, This hert rused and stal away Fro alle the houndes a prevy way. The houndes had overshote hem alle, And were on a defaute y-falle; Therwith the hunte wonder faste Blew a forloyn at the laste. I was go walked fro my tree, And as I wente, ther cam by me A whelp, that fauned me as I stood, That hadde y-folowed, and coude no good. Hit com and creep to me as lowe, Right as hit hadde me y-knowe, Hild doun his heed and Ioyned his eres, And leyde al smothe doun his heres. I wolde han caught hit, and anoon Hit fledde, and was fro me goon; And I him folwed, and hit forth wente Doun by a floury grene wente Ful thikke of gras, ful softe and swete, With floures fele, faire under fete, And litel used, hit seemed thus; For bothe Flora and Zephirus, They two that make floures growe, Had mad hir dwelling ther, I trowe; For hit was, on to beholde, As thogh the erthe envye wolde To be gayer than the heven, To have mo floures, swiche seven As in the welken sterres be. Hit had forgete the povertee That winter, through his colde morwes, Had mad hit suffren, and his sorwes; Al was forgeten, and that was sene. For al the wode was waxen grene, Swetnesse of dewe had mad it waxe. Hit is no need eek for to axe Wher ther were many grene greves, Or thikke of trees, so ful of leves; And every tree stood by him-selve Fro other wel ten foot or twelve. So grete trees, so huge of strengthe, Of fourty or fifty fadme lengthe, Clene withoute bough or stikke, With croppes brode, and eek as thikke— They were nat an inche a-sonder— That hit was shadwe over-al under; And many an hert and many an hinde Was both before me and bihinde. Of founes, soures, bukkes, doës Was ful the wode, and many roës, And many squirelles, that sete Ful hye upon the trees, and ete, And in hir maner made festes. Shortly, hit was so ful of bestes, That thogh Argus, the noble countour, Sete to rekene in his countour, And rekened with his figures ten— For by tho figures mowe al ken, If they be crafty, rekene and noumbre, And telle of every thing the noumbre— Yet shulde he fayle to rekene even The wondres, me mette in my sweven. But forth they romed wonder faste Doun the wode; so at the laste I was war of a man in blak, That sat and had y-turned his bak To an oke, an huge tree. ‘Lord,’ thoghte I, ‘who may that be? What ayleth him to sitten here?’ Anoon-right I wente nere; Than fond I sitte even upright A wonder wel-faringe knight— By the maner me thoughte so— Of good mochel, and yong therto, Of the age of four and twenty yeer. Upon his berde but litel heer, And he was clothed al in blakke. I stalked even unto his bakke, And ther I stood as stille as ought, That, sooth to saye, he saw me nought, For-why he heng his heed adoune. And with a deedly sorwful soune He made of ryme ten vers or twelve, Of a compleynt to him-selve, The moste pite, the moste rowthe, That ever I herde; for, by my trowthe, Hit was gret wonder that nature Might suffren any creature To have swich sorwe, and be not deed. Ful pitous, pale, and nothing reed, He sayde a lay, a maner song, Withoute note, withoute song, And hit was this; for wel I can Reherse hit; right thus hit began.— ‘I have of sorwe so gret woon, That Ioye gete I never noon, Now that I see my lady bright, Which I have loved with al my might, Is fro me deed, and is a-goon. Allas, [o] deeth! what ayleth thee, That thou noldest have taken me, Whan that thou toke my lady swete? That was so fayr, so fresh, so free, So good, that men may wel [y]-see Of al goodnesse she had no mete!’— Whan he had mad thus his complaynte, His sorowful herte gan faste faynte, And his spirites wexen dede; The blood was fled, for pure drede, Doun to his herte, to make him warm— For wel hit feled the herte had harm— To wite eek why hit was a-drad By kinde, and for to make hit glad; For hit is membre principal Of the body; and that made al His hewe chaunge and wexe grene And pale, for no blood [was] sene In no maner lime of his. Anoon therwith whan I saw this, He ferde thus evel ther he sete, I wente and stood right at his fete, And grette him, but he spak noght, But argued with his owne thoght, And in his witte disputed faste Why and how his lyf might laste; Him thoughte his sorwes were so smerte And lay so colde upon his herte; So, through his sorwe and hevy thoght, Made him that he ne herde me noght; For he had wel nigh lost his minde, Thogh Pan, that men clepe god of kinde, Were for his sorwes never so wrooth. But at the laste, to sayn right sooth, He was war of me, how I stood Before him, and dide of myn hood, And [grette] him, as I best coude. Debonairly, and no-thing loude, He sayde, ‘I prey thee, be not wrooth, I herde thee not, to sayn the sooth, Ne I saw thee not, sir, trewely.’ ‘A! goode sir, no fors,’ quod I, ‘I am right sory if I have ought Destroubled yow out of your thought; For-yive me if I have mis-take.’ ‘Yis, thamendes is light to make,’ Quod he, ‘for ther lyth noon ther-to; Ther is no-thing missayd nor do.’ Lo! how goodly spak this knight, As it had been another wight; He made it nouther tough ne queynte. And I saw that, and gan me aqueynte With him, and fond him so tretable, Right wonder skilful and resonable, As me thoghte, for al his bale. Anoon-right I gan finde a tale To him, to loke wher I might ought Have more knowing of his thought. ‘Sir,’ quod I, ‘this game is doon; I holde that this hert be goon; Thise huntes conne him nowher see.’ ‘I do no fors therof,’ quod he, ‘My thought is ther-on never a del.’ ‘By our lord,’ quod I, ‘I trow yow wel, Right so me thinketh by your chere. But, sir, oo thing wol ye here? Me thinketh, in gret sorwe I yow see; But certes, [good] sir, yif that ye Wolde ought discure me your wo, I wolde, as wis god helpe me so, Amende hit, yif I can or may; Ye mowe preve hit by assay. For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool, I wol do al my power hool; And telleth me of your sorwes smerte, Paraventure hit may ese your herte, That semeth ful seke under your syde.’ With that he loked on me asyde, As who sayth, ‘nay, that wol not be.’ ‘Graunt mercy, goode frend,’ quod he, ‘I thanke thee that thou woldest so, But hit may never the rather be do. No man may my sorwe glade, That maketh my hewe to falle and fade, And hath myn understonding lorn, That me is wo that I was born! May noght make my sorwes slyde, Nought the remedies of Ovyde; Ne Orpheus, god of melodye, Ne Dedalus, with playes slye; Ne hele me may phisicien, Noght Ypocras, ne Galien; Me is wo that I live houres twelve; But who so wol assaye him-selve Whether his herte can have pite Of any sorwe, lat him see me. I wrecche, that deeth hath mad al naked Of alle blisse that was ever maked, Y-worthe worste of alle wightes, That hate my dayes and my nightes; My lyf, my lustes be me lothe, For al welfare and I be wrothe. The pure deeth is so my fo, [Thogh] I wolde deye, hit wolde not so; For whan I folwe hit, hit wol flee; I wolde have [hit], hit nil not me. This is my peyne withoute reed, Alway deying, and be not deed, That Sesiphus, that lyth in helle, May not of more sorwe telle. And who so wiste al, by my trouthe, My sorwe, but he hadde routhe And pite of my sorwes smerte, That man hath a feendly herte. For who so seeth me first on morwe May seyn, he hath [y]-met with sorwe; For I am sorwe and sorwe is I. ‘Allas! and I wol telle the why; My [song] is turned to pleyning, And al my laughter to weping, My glade thoghtes to hevinesse, In travaile is myn ydelnesse And eek my reste; my wele is wo. My good is harm, and ever-mo In wrathe is turned my pleying, And my delyt in-to sorwing. Myn hele is turned into seeknesse, In drede is al my sikernesse. To derke is turned al my light, My wit is foly, my day is night, My love is hate, my sleep waking, My mirthe and meles is fasting, My countenaunce is nycete, And al abaved wher-so I be, My pees, in pleding and in werre; Allas! how mighte I fare werre? ‘My boldnesse is turned to shame, For fals Fortune hath pleyd a game Atte ches with me, allas! the whyle! The trayteresse fals and ful of gyle, That al behoteth and no-thing halt, She goth upryght and yet she halt, That baggeth foule and loketh faire, The dispitousë debonaire, That scorneth many a creature! An ydole of fals portraiture Is she, for she wil sone wryen; She is the monstres heed y-wryen, As filth over y-strawed with floures; Hir moste worship and hir [flour is] To lyen, for that is hir nature; Withoute feyth, lawe, or mesure She is fals; and ever laughinge With oon eye, and that other wepinge. That is broght up, she set al doun. I lykne hir to the scorpioun, That is a fals flatering beste; For with his hede he maketh feste, But al amid his flateringe With his tayle he wol stinge, And envenyme; and so wol she. She is thenvyous charite That is ay fals, and semeth wele, So turneth she hir false whele Aboute, for it is no-thing stable, Now by the fyre, now at table; Ful many oon hath she thus y-blent. She is pley of enchauntement, That semeth oon and is nat so, The false theef! what hath she do, Trowest thou? by our lord, I wol thee seye. Atte ches with me she gan to pleye; With hir false draughtes divers She stal on me, and took my fers. And whan I saw my fers aweye, Alas! I couthe no lenger pleye, But seyde, “farwel, swete, y-wis, And farwel al that ever ther is!” Therwith Fortune seyde “chek here!” And “mate!” in mid pointe of the chekkere With a poune erraunt, allas! Ful craftier to pley she was Than Athalus, that made the game First of the ches: so was his name. But god wolde I had ones or twyes Y-koud and knowe the Ieupardyes That coude the Grek Pithagores! I shulde have pleyd the bet at ches, And kept my fers the bet therby; And thogh wherto? for trewely I hold that wish nat worth a stree! Hit had be never the bet for me. For Fortune can so many a wyle, Ther be but fewe can hir begyle, And eek she is the las to blame; My-self I wolde have do the same, Before god, hadde I been as she; She oghte the more excused be. For this I say yet more therto, Hadde I be god and mighte have do My wille, whan my fers she caughte, I wolde have drawe the same draughte. For, also wis god yive me reste, I dar wel swere she took the beste! ‘But through that draughte I have lorn My blisse; allas! that I was born! For evermore, I trowe trewly, For al my wil, my lust hoolly Is turned; but yet, what to done? By our lord, hit is to deye sone; For no-thing I [ne] leve it noght, But live and deye right in this thoght. Ther nis planete in firmament, Ne in air, ne in erthe, noon element, That they ne yive me a yift echoon Of weping, whan I am aloon. For whan that I avyse me wel, And bethenke me every-del, How that ther lyth in rekening, In my sorwe, for no-thing; And how ther leveth no gladnesse May gladde me of my distresse, And how I have lost suffisance, And therto I have no plesance, Than may I say, I have right noght. And whan al this falleth in my thoght, Allas! than am I overcome! For that is doon is not to come! I have more sorowe than Tantale.’ And whan I herde him telle this tale Thus pitously, as I yow telle, Unnethe mighte I lenger dwelle, Hit dide myn herte so moche wo. ‘A! good sir!’ quod I, ‘say not so! Have som pite on your nature That formed yow to creature, Remembre yow of Socrates; For he ne counted nat three strees Of noght that Fortune coude do.’ ‘No,’ quod he, ‘I can not so.’ ‘Why so? good sir! parde!’ quod I; ‘Ne say noght so, for trewely, Thogh ye had lost the ferses twelve, And ye for sorwe mordred your-selve, Ye sholde be dampned in this cas By as good right as Medea was, That slow hir children for Iason; And Phyllis als for Demophon Heng hir-self, so weylaway! For he had broke his terme-day To come to hir. Another rage Had Dydo, quene eek of Cartage, That slow hir-self, for Eneas Was fals; [a!] whiche a fool she was! And Ecquo dyed for Narcisus Nolde nat love hir; and right thus Hath many another foly don. And for Dalida dyed Sampson, That slow him-self with a pilere. But ther is [noon] a-lyve here Wolde for a fers make this wo!’ ‘Why so?’ quod he; ‘hit is nat so; Thou wost ful litel what thou menest; I have lost more than thou wenest.’ ‘Lo, [sir,] how may that be?’ quod I; ‘Good sir, tel me al hoolly In what wyse, how, why, and wherfore That ye have thus your blisse lore.’ ‘Blythly,’ quod he, ‘com sit adoun; I telle thee up condicioun That thou hoolly, with al thy wit, Do thyn entent to herkene hit.’ ‘Yis, sir.’ ‘Swere thy trouthe ther-to.’ ‘Gladly.’ ‘Do than holde her-to!’ ‘I shal right blythly, so god me save, Hoolly, with al the witte I have, Here yow, as wel as I can.’ ‘A goddes half!’ quod he, and began:— ‘Sir,’ quod he, ‘sith first I couthe Have any maner wit fro youthe, Or kyndely understonding To comprehende, in any thing, What love was, in myn owne wit, Dredeles, I have ever yit Be tributary, and yiven rente To love hoolly with goode entente, And through plesaunce become his thral, With good wil, body, herte, and al. Al this I putte in his servage, As to my lorde, and dide homage; And ful devoutly prayde him to, He shulde besette myn herte so, That it plesaunce to him were, And worship to my lady dere. ‘And this was longe, and many a yeer Or that myn herte was set o-wher, That I did thus, and niste why; I trowe hit cam me kindely. Paraunter I was therto most able As a whyt wal or a table; For hit is redy to cacche and take Al that men wil therin make, Wher-so men wol portreye or peynte, Be the werkes never so queynte. ‘And thilke tyme I ferde so I was able to have lerned tho, And to have coud as wel or better, Paraunter, other art or letter. But for love cam first in my thought, Therfore I forgat it nought. I chees love to my firste craft, Therfor hit is with me [y]-laft. Forwhy I took hit of so yong age, That malice hadde my corage Nat that tyme turned to no-thing Through to mochel knowleching. For that tyme youthe, my maistresse, Governed me in ydelnesse; For hit was in my firste youthe, And tho ful litel good I couthe; For al my werkes were flittinge, And al my thoghtes varyinge; Al were to me y-liche good, That I knew tho; but thus hit stood. ‘Hit happed that I cam on a day Into a place, ther I say, Trewly, the fayrest companyë Of ladies, that ever man with yë Had seen togedres in oo place. Shal I clepe hit hap other grace That broghte me ther? nay, but Fortune, That is to lyen ful comune, The false trayteresse, pervers, God wolde I coude clepe hir wers! For now she worcheth me ful wo, And I wol telle sone why so. ‘Among thise ladies thus echoon, Soth to seyn, I saw [ther] oon That was lyk noon of [al] the route; For I dar swere, withoute doute, That as the someres sonne bright Is fairer, clerer, and hath more light Than any planete, [is] in heven, The mone, or the sterres seven, For al the worlde, so had she Surmounted hem alle of beaute, Of maner and of comlinesse, Of stature and wel set gladnesse, Of goodlihede so wel beseye— Shortly, what shal I more seye? By god, and by his halwes twelve, It was my swete, right as hir-selve! She had so stedfast countenaunce, So noble port and meyntenaunce. And Love, that had herd my bone, Had espyed me thus sone, That she ful sone, in my thoght, As helpe me god, so was y-caught So sodenly, that I ne took No maner [reed] but at hir look And at myn herte; for-why hir eyen So gladly, I trow, myn herte seyen, That purely tho myn owne thoght Seyde hit were [bet] serve hir for noght Than with another to be wel. And hit was sooth, for, everydel, I wil anoon-right telle thee why. ‘I saw hir daunce so comlily, Carole and singe so swetely, Laughe and pleye so womanly, And loke so debonairly, So goodly speke and so frendly, That certes, I trow, that evermore Nas seyn so blisful a tresore. For every heer [up]on hir hede, Soth to seyn, hit was not rede, Ne nouther yelw, ne broun hit nas; Me thoghte, most lyk gold hit was. And whiche eyen my lady hadde! Debonair, goode, glade, and sadde, Simple, of good mochel, noght to wyde; Therto hir look nas not a-syde, Ne overthwert, but beset so wel, Hit drew and took up, everydel, Alle that on hir gan beholde. Hir eyen semed anoon she wolde Have mercy; fooles wenden so; But hit was never the rather do. Hit nas no countrefeted thing, It was hir owne pure loking, That the goddesse, dame Nature, Had made hem opene by mesure, And close; for, were she never so glad, Hir loking was not foly sprad, Ne wildely, thogh that she pleyde; But ever, me thoghte, hir eyen seyde, “By god, my wrathe is al for-yive!” ‘Therwith hir liste so wel to live, That dulnesse was of hir a-drad. She nas to sobre ne to glad; In alle thinges more mesure Had never, I trowe, creature. But many oon with hir loke she herte, And that sat hir ful lyte at herte, For she knew no-thing of hir thoght; But whether she knew, or knew hit noght, Algate she ne roghte of hem a stree! To gete hir love no ner nas he That woned at home, than he in Inde; The formest was alway behinde. But goode folk, over al other, She loved as man may do his brother; Of whiche love she was wonder large, In skilful places that bere charge. ‘Which a visage had she ther-to! Allas! myn herte is wonder wo That I ne can discryven hit! Me lakketh bothe English and wit For to undo hit at the fulle; And eek my spirits be so dulle So greet a thing for to devyse. I have no wit that can suffyse To comprehenden hir beaute; But thus moche dar I seyn, that she Was rody, fresh, and lyvely hewed; And every day hir beaute newed. And negh hir face was alder-best; For certes, Nature had swich lest To make that fair, that trewly she Was hir cheef patron of beautee, And cheef ensample of al hir werke, And moustre; for, be hit never so derke, Me thinketh I see hir ever-mo. And yet more-over, thogh alle tho That ever lived were now a-lyve, [They] ne sholde have founde to discryve In al hir face a wikked signe; For hit was sad, simple, and benigne. ‘And which a goodly softe speche Had that swete, my lyves leche! So frendly, and so wel y-grounded, Up al resoun so wel y-founded, And so tretable to alle gode, That I dar swere by the rode, Of eloquence was never founde So swete a sowninge facounde, Ne trewer tonged, ne scorned lasse, Ne bet coude hele; that, by the masse I durste swere, thogh the pope hit songe, That ther was never through hir tonge Man ne woman gretly harmed; As for hir, [ther] was al harm hid; Ne lasse flatering in hir worde, That purely, hir simple recorde Was founde as trewe as any bonde, Or trouthe of any mannes honde. Ne chyde she coude never a del, That knoweth al the world ful wel. ‘But swich a fairnesse of a nekke Had that swete, that boon nor brekke Nas ther non sene, that mis-sat. Hit was whyt, smothe, streght, and flat, Withouten hole; [and] canel-boon, As by seming, had she noon. Hir throte, as I have now memoire, Semed a round tour of yvoire, Of good gretnesse, and noght to grete. ‘And gode faire Whyte she hete, That was my lady name right. She was bothe fair and bright, She hadde not hir name wrong. Right faire shuldres, and body long She hadde, and armes, every lith Fattish, flesshy, not greet therwith; Right whyte handes, and nayles rede, Rounde brestes; and of good brede Hir hippes were, a streight flat bak. I knew on hir non other lak That al hir limmes nere sewing, In as fer as I had knowing. ‘Therto she coude so wel pleye, Whan that hir liste, that I dar seye, That she was lyk to torche bright, That every man may take of light Ynogh, and hit hath never the lesse. ‘Of maner and of comlinesse Right so ferde my lady dere; For every wight of hir manere Might cacche ynogh, if that he wolde, If he had eyen hir to beholde. For I dar sweren, if that she Had among ten thousand be, She wolde have be, at the leste, A cheef mirour of al the feste, Thogh they had stonden in a rowe, To mennes eyen that coude have knowe. For wher-so men had pleyd or waked, Me thoghte the felawship as naked Withouten hir, that saw I ones, As a coroune withoute stones. Trewely she was, to myn yë, The soleyn fenix of Arabye, For ther liveth never but oon; Ne swich as she ne knew I noon. ‘To speke of goodnesse; trewly she Had as moche debonairte As ever had Hester in the bible, And more, if more were possible. And, soth to seyne, therwith-al She had a wit so general, So hool enclyned to alle gode, That al hir wit was set, by the rode, Withoute malice, upon gladnesse; Therto I saw never yet a lesse Harmful, than she was in doing. I sey nat that she ne had knowing What was harm; or elles she Had coud no good, so thinketh me. ‘And trewly, for to speke of trouthe, But she had had, hit had be routhe. Therof she had so moche hir del— And I dar seyn and swere hit wel— That Trouthe him-self, over al and al, Had chose his maner principal In hir, that was his resting-place. Ther-to she hadde the moste grace, To have stedfast perseveraunce, And esy, atempre governaunce, That ever I knew or wiste yit; So pure suffraunt was hir wit. And reson gladly she understood, Hit folowed wel she coude good. She used gladly to do wel; These were hir maners every-del. ‘Therwith she loved so wel right, She wrong do wolde to no wight; No wight might do hir no shame, She loved so wel hir owne name. Hir luste to holde no wight in honde; Ne, be thou siker, she nolde fonde To holde no wight in balaunce, By half word ne by countenaunce, But-if men wolde upon hir lye; Ne sende men in-to Walakye, To Pruyse and in-to Tartarye, To Alisaundre, ne in-to Turkye, And bidde him faste, anoon that he Go hoodles to the drye see, And come hoom by the Carrenare; And seye, “Sir, be now right ware That I may of yow here seyn Worship, or that ye come ageyn!” She ne used no suche knakkes smale. ‘But wherfor that I telle my tale? Right on this same, as I have seyd, Was hoolly al my love leyd; For certes, she was, that swete wyf, My suffisaunce, my lust, my lyf, Myn hap, myn hele, and al my blisse, My worldes welfare and my [lisse], And I hirs hoolly, everydel.’ ‘By our lord,’ quod I, ‘I trowe yow wel! Hardely, your love was wel beset, I not how ye mighte have do bet.’ ‘Bet? ne no wight so wel!’ quod he. ‘I trowe hit, sir,’ quod I, ‘parde!’ ‘Nay, leve hit wel!’ ‘Sir, so do I; I leve yow wel, that trewely Yow thoghte, that she was the beste, And to beholde the alderfaireste, Who so had loked with your eyen.’ ‘With myn? nay, alle that hir seyen Seyde, and sworen hit was so. And thogh they ne hadde, I wolde tho Have loved best my lady fre, Thogh I had had al the beautee That ever had Alcipyades, And al the strengthe of Ercules, And therto had the worthinesse Of Alisaundre, and al the richesse That ever was in Babiloyne, In Cartage, or in Macedoyne, Or in Rome, or in Ninive; And therto al-so hardy be As was Ector, so have I Ioye, That Achilles slow at Troye— And therfor was he slayn also In a temple, for bothe two Were slayn, he and Antilegius, And so seyth Dares Frigius, For love of [hir] Polixena— Or ben as wys as Minerva, I wolde ever, withoute drede, Have loved hir, for I moste nede! “Nede!” nay, I gabbe now, Noght “nede,” and I wol telle how, For of good wille myn herte hit wolde, And eek to love hir I was holde As for the fairest and the beste. ‘She was as good, so have I reste, As ever was Penelope of Grece, Or as the noble wyf Lucrece, That was the beste—he telleth thus, The Romain Tytus Livius— She was as good, and no-thing lyke, Thogh hir stories be autentyke; Algate she was as trewe as she. ‘But wherfor that I telle thee Whan I first my lady sey? I was right yong, [the] sooth to sey, And ful gret need I hadde to lerne; Whan my herte wolde yerne To love, it was a greet empryse. But as my wit coude best suffyse, After my yonge childly wit, Withoute drede, I besette hit To love hir in my beste wyse, To do hir worship and servyse That I tho coude, by my trouthe, Withoute feyning outher slouthe; For wonder fayn I wolde hir see. So mochel hit amended me, That, whan I saw hir first a-morwe, I was warished of al my sorwe Of al day after, til hit were eve; Me thoghte no-thing mighte me greve, Were my sorwes never so smerte. And yit she sit so in myn herte, That, by my trouthe, I nolde noght, For al this worlde, out of my thoght Leve my lady; no, trewly!’ ‘Now, by my trouthe, sir,’ quod I, ‘Me thinketh ye have such a chaunce As shrift withoute repentaunce.’ ‘Repentaunce! nay fy,’ quod he; ‘Shulde I now repente me To love? nay, certes, than were I wel Wers than was Achitofel, Or Anthenor, so have I Ioye, The traytour that betraysed Troye, Or the false Genelon, He that purchased the treson Of Rowland and of Olivere. Nay, whyl I am a-lyve here I nil foryete hir never-mo.’ ‘Now, goode sir,’ quod I [right] tho, ‘Ye han wel told me her-before. It is no need reherse hit more How ye sawe hir first, and where; But wolde ye telle me the manere, To hir which was your firste speche— Therof I wolde yow be-seche— And how she knewe first your thoght, Whether ye loved hir or noght, And telleth me eek what ye have lore; I herde yow telle her-before.’ ‘Ye,’ seyde he, ‘thou nost what thou menest; I have lost more than thou wenest.’ ‘What los is that, [sir]?’ quod I tho; ‘Nil she not love yow? is hit so? Or have ye oght [y-]doon amis, That she hath left yow? is hit this? For goddes love, tel me al.’ ‘Before god,’ quod he, ‘and I shal. I saye right as I have seyd, On hir was al my love leyd; And yet she niste hit never a del Noght longe tyme, leve hit wel. For be right siker, I durste noght For al this worlde telle hir my thoght, Ne I wolde have wratthed hir, trewly. For wostow why? she was lady Of the body; she had the herte, And who hath that, may not asterte. ‘But, for to kepe me fro ydelnesse, Trewly I did my besinesse To make songes, as I best coude, And ofte tyme I song hem loude; And made songes a gret del, Al-thogh I coude not make so wel Songes, ne knowe the art al, As coude Lamekes sone Tubal, That fond out first the art of songe; For, as his brothers hamers ronge Upon his anvelt up and doun, Therof he took the firste soun; But Grekes seyn, Pictagoras, That he the firste finder was Of the art; Aurora telleth so, But therof no fors, of hem two. Algates songes thus I made Of my feling, myn herte to glade; And lo! this was [the] alther-firste, I not wher [that] hit were the werste.— “Lord, hit maketh myn herte light, Whan I thenke on that swete wight That is so semely on to see; And wisshe to god hit might so be, That she wolde holde me for hir knight, My lady, that is so fair and bright!”— ‘Now have I told thee, sooth to saye, My firste song. Upon a daye I bethoghte me what wo And sorwe that I suffred tho For hir, and yet she wiste hit noght, Ne telle hir durste I nat my thoght. “Allas!” thoghte I, “I can no reed; And, but I telle hir, I nam but deed; And if I telle hir, to seye sooth, I am a-dred she wol be wrooth; Allas! what shal I thanne do?” ‘In this debat I was so wo, Me thoghte myn herte braste a-tweyn! So atte laste, soth to seyn, I me bethoghte that nature Ne formed never in creature So moche beaute, trewely, And bounte, withouten mercy. ‘In hope of that, my tale I tolde With sorwe, as that I never sholde, For nedes; and, maugree my heed, I moste have told hir or be deed. I not wel how that I began, Ful evel rehersen hit I can; And eek, as helpe me god with-al, I trowe hit was in the dismal, That was the ten woundes of Egipte; For many a word I over-skipte In my tale, for pure fere Lest my wordes mis-set were. With sorweful herte, and woundes dede, Softe and quaking for pure drede And shame, and stinting in my tale For ferde, and myn hewe al pale, Ful ofte I wex bothe pale and reed; Bowing to hir, I heng the heed; I durste nat ones loke hir on, For wit, manere, and al was gon. I seyde “mercy!” and no more; Hit nas no game, hit sat me sore. ‘So atte laste, sooth to seyn, Whan that myn herte was come ageyn, To telle shortly al my speche, With hool herte I gan hir beseche That she wolde be my lady swete; And swor, and gan hir hertely hete Ever to be stedfast and trewe, And love hir alwey freshly newe, And never other lady have, And al hir worship for to save As I best coude; I swor hir this— “For youres is al that ever ther is For evermore, myn herte swete! And never false yow, but I mete, I nil, as wis god helpe me so!” ‘And whan I had my tale y-do, God wot, she acounted nat a stree Of al my tale, so thoghte me. To telle shortly as hit is, Trewly hir answere, hit was this; I can not now wel counterfete Hir wordes, but this was the grete Of hir answere; she sayde, “nay” Al-outerly. Allas! that day The sorwe I suffred, and the wo! That trewly Cassandra, that so Bewayled the destruccioun Of Troye and of Ilioun, Had never swich sorwe as I tho. I durste no more say therto For pure fere, but stal away; And thus I lived ful many a day: That trewely, I hadde no need Ferther than my beddes heed Never a day to seche sorwe; I fond hit redy every morwe, For-why I loved hir in no gere. ‘So hit befel, another yere, I thoughte ones I wolde fonde To do hir knowe and understonde My wo; and she wel understood That I ne wilned thing but good, And worship, and to kepe hir name Over al thing, and drede hir shame, And was so besy hir to serve;— And pite were I shulde sterve, Sith that I wilned noon harm, y-wis. So whan my lady knew al this, My lady yaf me al hoolly The noble yift of hir mercy, Saving hir worship, by al weyes; Dredles, I mene noon other weyes. And therwith she yaf me a ring; I trowe hit was the firste thing; But if myn herte was y-waxe Glad, that is no need to axe! As helpe me god, I was as blyve, Reysed, as fro dethe to lyve, Of alle happes the alder-beste, The gladdest and the moste at reste. For trewely, that swete wight, Whan I had wrong and she the right, She wolde alwey so goodely For-yeve me so debonairly. In alle my youthe, in alle chaunce, She took me in hir governaunce. ‘Therwith she was alway so trewe, Our Ioye was ever y-liche newe; Our hertes wern so even a payre, That never nas that oon contrayre To that other, for no wo. For sothe, y-liche they suffred tho Oo blisse and eek oo sorwe bothe; Y-liche they were bothe gladde and wrothe; Al was us oon, withoute were. And thus we lived ful many a yere So wel, I can nat telle how.’ ‘Sir,’ quod I, ‘wher is she now?’ ‘Now!’ quod he, and stinte anoon. Therwith he wex as deed as stoon, And seyde, ‘allas! that I was bore! That was the los, that her-before I tolde thee, that I had lorn. Bethenk how I seyde her-beforn, “Thou wost ful litel what thou menest; I have lost more than thou wenest”— God wot, allas! right that was she!’ ‘Allas! sir, how? what may that be?’ ‘She is deed!’ ‘Nay!’ ‘Yis, by my trouthe!’ ‘Is that your los? by god, hit is routhe!’ And with that worde, right anoon, They gan to strake forth; al was doon, For that tyme, the hert-hunting. With that, me thoghte, that this king Gan [quikly] hoomward for to ryde Unto a place ther besyde, Which was from us but a lyte, A long castel with walles whyte, By seynt Iohan! on a riche hil, As me mette; but thus it fil. Right thus me mette, as I yow telle, That in the castel was a belle, As hit had smiten houres twelve.— Therwith I awook my-selve, And fond me lying in my bed; And the book that I had red, Of Alcyone and Seys the king, And of the goddes of sleping, I fond it in myn honde ful even. Thoghte I, ‘this is so queynt a sweven, That I wol, by processe of tyme, Fonde to putte this sweven in ryme As I can best’; and that anoon.— This was my sweven; now hit is doon. Explicit the Boke of the Duchesse. IV. THE COMPLEYNT OF MARS. The Proem. ‘Gladeth, ye foules, of the morow gray, Lo! Venus risen among yon rowes rede! And floures fresshe, honoureth ye this day; For when the sonne uprist, then wol ye sprede. But ye lovers, that lye in any drede, Fleëth, lest wikked tonges yow espye; Lo! yond the sonne, the candel of Ielosye! With teres blewe, and with a wounded herte Taketh your leve; and, with seynt Iohn to borow, Apeseth somwhat of your sorowes smerte, Tyme cometh eft, that cese shal your sorow; The glade night is worth an hevy morow!’— (Seynt Valentyne! a foul thus herde I singe Upon thy day, er sonne gan up-springe).— Yet sang this foul—‘I rede yow al a-wake, And ye, that han not chosen in humble wyse, Without repenting cheseth yow your make. And ye, that han ful chosen as I devyse, Yet at the leste renoveleth your servyse; Confermeth it perpetuely to dure, And paciently taketh your aventure. And for the worship of this hye feste, Yet wol I, in my briddes wyse, singe The sentence of the compleynt, at the leste, That woful Mars made atte departinge Fro fresshe Venus in a morweninge, Whan Phebus, with his fyry torches rede, Ransaked every lover in his drede. The Story. Whylom the thridde hevenes lord above, As wel by hevenish revolucioun As by desert, hath wonne Venus his love, And she hath take him in subieccioun, And as a maistresse taught him his lessoun, Comaunding him that never, in hir servyse, He nere so bold no lover to despyse. For she forbad him Ielosye at alle, And cruelte, and bost, and tirannye; She made him at hir lust so humble and talle, That when hir deyned caste on him her yë, He took in pacience to live or dye; And thus she brydeleth him in hir manere, With no-thing but with scourging of hir chere. Who regneth now in blisse but Venus, That hath this worthy knight in governaunce? Who singeth now but Mars, that serveth thus The faire Venus, causer of plesaunce? He bynt him to perpetual obeisaunce, And she bynt hir to loven him for ever, But so be that his trespas hit dissever. Thus be they knit, and regnen as in heven By loking most; til hit fil, on a tyde, That by hir bothe assent was set a steven, That Mars shal entre, as faste as he may glyde, Into hir nexte paleys, to abyde, Walking his cours til she had him a-take, And he preyde hir to haste hir for his sake. Then seyde he thus—“myn hertes lady swete, Ye knowe wel my mischef in that place; For sikerly, til that I with yow mete, My lyf stant ther in aventure and grace; But when I see the beaute of your face, Ther is no dreed of deth may do me smerte, For al your lust is ese to myn herte.” She hath so gret compassion of hir knight, That dwelleth in solitude til she come; For hit stood so, that ilke tyme, no wight Counseyled him, ne seyde to him welcome, That nigh hir wit for wo was overcome; Wherfore she spedde hir as faste in hir weye, Almost in oon day, as he dide in tweye. The grete Ioye that was betwix hem two, Whan they be met, ther may no tunge telle, Ther is no more, but unto bed they go, And thus in Ioye and blisse I let hem dwelle; This worthy Mars, that is of knighthod welle, The flour of fairnes lappeth in his armes, And Venus kisseth Mars, the god of armes. Soiourned hath this Mars, of which I rede, In chambre amid the paleys prively A certeyn tyme, til him fel a drede, Through Phebus, that was comen hastely Within the paleys-yates sturdely, With torche in honde, of which the stremes brighte On Venus chambre knokkeden ful lighte. The chambre, ther as lay this fresshe quene, Depeynted was with whyte boles grete, And by the light she knew, that shoon so shene, That Phebus cam to brenne hem with his hete; This sely Venus, dreynt in teres wete, Enbraceth Mars, and seyde, “alas! I dye! The torch is come, that al this world wol wrye.” Up sterte Mars, him liste not to slepe, Whan he his lady herde so compleyne; But, for his nature was not for to wepe, In stede of teres, fro his eyen tweyne The fyry sparkes brosten out for peyne; And hente his hauberk, that lay him besyde; Flee wolde he not, ne mighte him-selven hyde. He throweth on his helm of huge wighte, And girt him with his swerde; and in his honde His mighty spere, as he was wont to fighte, He shaketh so that almost it to-wonde; Ful hevy he was to walken over londe; He may not holde with Venus companye, But bad hir fleen, lest Phebus hir espye. O woful Mars! alas! what mayst thou seyn, That in the paleys of thy disturbaunce Art left behinde, in peril to be sleyn? And yet ther-to is double thy penaunce, For she, that hath thyn herte in governaunce, Is passed halfe the stremes of thyn yën; That thou nere swift, wel mayst thou wepe and cryen. Now fleeth Venus un-to Cylenius tour, With voide cours, for fere of Phebus light. Alas! and ther ne hath she no socour, For she ne fond ne saw no maner wight; And eek as ther she had but litil might; Wher-for, hir-selven for to hyde and save, Within the gate she fledde into a cave. Derk was this cave, and smoking as the helle, Not but two pas within the gate hit stood; A naturel day in derk I lete hir dwelle. Now wol I speke of Mars, furious and wood; For sorow he wolde have seen his herte blood; Sith that he mighte hir don no companye, He ne roghte not a myte for to dye. So feble he wex, for hete and for his wo, That nigh he swelt, he mighte unnethe endure; He passeth but oo steyre in dayes two, But ner the les, for al his hevy armure, He foloweth hir that is his lyves cure; For whos departing he took gretter yre Thanne for al his brenning in the fyre. After he walketh softely a pas, Compleyning, that hit pite was to here. He seyde, “O lady bright, Venus! alas! That ever so wyde a compas is my spere! Alas! whan shal I mete yow, herte dere, This twelfte day of April I endure, Through Ielous Phebus, this misaventure.” Now god helpe sely Venus allone! But, as god wolde, hit happed for to be, That, whyl that Venus weping made hir mone, Cylenius, ryding in his chevauchè, Fro Venus valance mighte his paleys see, And Venus he salueth, and maketh chere, And hir receyveth as his frend ful dere. Mars dwelleth forth in his adversite, Compleyning ever on hir departinge; And what his compleynt was, remembreth me; And therfore, in this lusty morweninge, As I best can, I wol hit seyn and singe, And after that I wol my leve take; And God yeve every wight Ioye of his make! The compleynt of Mars. The Proem of the Compleynt. The ordre of compleynt requireth skilfully, That if a wight shal pleyne pitously, There mot be cause wherfor that men pleyne; Or men may deme he pleyneth folily And causeles; alas! that am not I! Wherfor the ground and cause of al my peyne, So as my troubled wit may hit ateyne, I wol reherse; not for to have redresse, But to declare my ground of hevinesse. Devotion. The firste tyme, alas! that I was wroght, And for certeyn effectes hider broght By him that lordeth ech intelligence, I yaf my trewe servise and my thoght, For evermore—how dere I have hit boght!— To hir, that is of so gret excellence, That what wight that first sheweth his presence, When she is wroth and taketh of him no cure, He may not longe in Ioye of love endure. This is no feyned mater that I telle; My lady is the verrey sours and welle Of beaute, lust, fredom, and gentilnesse, Of riche aray—how dere men hit selle!— Of al disport in which men frendly dwelle, Of love and pley, and of benigne humblesse, Of soune of instruments of al swetnesse; And therto so wel fortuned and thewed, That through the world hir goodnesse is y-shewed. What wonder is then, thogh that I besette My servise on suche oon, that may me knette To wele or wo, sith hit lyth in hir might? Therfor my herte for ever I to hir hette; Ne trewly, for my dethe, I shal not lette To ben hir trewest servaunt and hir knight. I flater noght, that may wite every wight; For this day in hir servise shal I dye; But grace be, I see hir never with yë. A Lady in fear and woe. To whom shal I than pleyne of my distresse? Who may me helpe, who may my harm redresse? Shal I compleyne unto my lady free? Nay, certes! for she hath such hevinesse, For fere and eek for wo, that, as I gesse, In litil tyme hit wol hir bane be. But were she sauf, hit wer no fors of me. Alas! that ever lovers mote endure, For love, so many a perilous aventure! For thogh so be that lovers be as trewe As any metal that is forged newe, In many a cas hem tydeth ofte sorowe. Somtyme hir ladies will not on hem rewe, Somtyme, yif that Ielosye hit knewe, They mighten lightly leye hir heed to borowe; Somtyme envyous folke with tunges horowe Depraven hem; alas! whom may they plese? But he be fals, no lover hath his ese. But what availeth suche a long sermoun Of aventures of love, up and doun? I wol returne and speken of my peyne; The point is this of my destruccioun, My righte lady, my salvacioun, Is in affray, and not to whom to pleyne. O herte swete, O lady sovereyne! For your disese, wel oghte I swoune and swelte, Thogh I non other harm ne drede felte. Instability of Happiness. To what fyn made the god that sit so hye, Benethen him, love other companye, And streyneth folk to love, malgre hir hede? And then hir Ioye, for oght I can espye, Ne lasteth not the twinkeling of an yë, And somme han never Ioye til they be dede. What meneth this? what is this mistihede? Wherto constreyneth he his folk so faste Thing to desyre, but hit shulde laste? And thogh he made a lover love a thing, And maketh hit seme stedfast and during, Yet putteth he in hit such misaventure, That reste nis ther noon in his yeving. And that is wonder, that so Iust a king Doth such hardnesse to his creature. Thus, whether love breke or elles dure, Algates he that hath with love to done Hath ofter wo then changed is the mone. Hit semeth he hath to lovers enmite, And lyk a fissher, as men alday may see, Baiteth his angle-hook with som plesaunce, Til mony a fish is wood til that he be Sesed ther-with; and then at erst hath he Al his desyr, and ther-with al mischaunce; And thogh the lyne breke, he hath penaunce; For with the hoke he wounded is so sore, That he his wages hath for ever-more. The Brooch of Thebes. The broche of Thebes was of suche a kinde, So ful of rubies and of stones Inde, That every wight, that sette on hit an yë, He wende anon to worthe out of his minde; So sore the beaute wolde his herte binde, Til he hit hadde, him thoghte he moste dye; And whan that hit was his, than shulde he drye Such wo for drede, ay whyl that he hit hadde, That welnigh for the fere he shulde madde. And whan hit was fro his possessioun, Than had he double wo and passioun For he so fair a tresor had forgo; But yet this broche, as in conclusioun, Was not the cause of this confusioun; But he that wroghte hit enfortuned hit so, That every wight that had hit shuld have wo; And therfor in the worcher was the vyce, And in the covetour that was so nyce. So fareth hit by lovers and by me; For thogh my lady have so gret beaute, That I was mad til I had gete hir grace, She was not cause of myn adversite, But he that wroghte hir, also mot I thee, That putte suche a beaute in hir face, That made me to covete and purchace Myn owne deth; him wyte I that I dye, And myn unwit, that ever I clomb so hye. An Appeal for Sympathy. But to yow, hardy knightes of renoun, Sin that ye be of my divisioun, Al be I not worthy to so grete a name, Yet, seyn these clerkes, I am your patroun; Ther-for ye oghte have som compassioun Of my disese, and take it noght a-game. The proudest of yow may be mad ful tame; Wherfor I prey yow, of your gentilesse, That ye compleyne for myn hevinesse. And ye, my ladies, that ben trewe and stable, By way of kinde, ye oghten to be able To have pite of folk that be in peyne: Now have ye cause to clothe yow in sable; Sith that your emperice, the honorable, Is desolat, wel oghte ye to pleyne; Now shuld your holy teres falle and reyne. Alas! your honour and your emperice, Nigh deed for drede, ne can hir not chevise. Compleyneth eek, ye lovers, al in-fere, For hir that, with unfeyned humble chere, Was ever redy to do yow socour; Compleyneth hir that ever hath had yow dere; Compleyneth beaute, fredom, and manere; Compleyneth hir that endeth your labour; Compleyneth thilke ensample of al honour, That never dide but al gentilesse; Kytheth therfor on hir som kindenesse.’ V. THE PARLEMENT OF FOULES. The Proem. The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne, Thassay so hard, so sharp the conquering, The dredful Ioy, that alwey slit so yerne, Al this mene I by love, that my feling Astonyeth with his wonderful worching So sore y-wis, that whan I on him thinke, Nat wot I wel wher that I wake or winke. For al be that I knowe not love in dede, Ne wot how that he quyteth folk hir hyre, Yet happeth me ful ofte in bokes rede Of his miracles, and his cruel yre; Ther rede I wel he wol be lord and syre, I dar not seyn, his strokes been so sore, But God save swich a lord! I can no more. Of usage, what for luste what for lore, On bokes rede I ofte, as I yow tolde. But wherfor that I speke al this? not yore Agon, hit happed me for to beholde Upon a boke, was write with lettres olde; And ther-upon, a certeyn thing to lerne, The longe day ful faste I radde and yerne. For out of olde feldes, as men seith, Cometh al this newe corn fro yeer to yere; And out of olde bokes, in good feith, Cometh al this newe science that men lere. But now to purpos as of this matere— To rede forth hit gan me so delyte, That al the day me thoughte but a lyte. This book of which I make mencioun, Entitled was al thus, as I shal telle, ‘Tullius of the dreme of Scipioun’; Chapitres seven hit hadde, of hevene and helle, And erthe, and soules that therinne dwelle, Of whiche, as shortly as I can hit trete, Of his sentence I wol you seyn the grete. First telleth hit, whan Scipioun was come In Afrik, how he mette Massinisse, That him for Ioye in armes hath y nome. Than telleth [hit] hir speche and al the blisse That was betwix hem, til the day gan misse; And how his auncestre, African so dere, Gan in his slepe that night to him appere. Than telleth hit that, fro a sterry place, How African hath him Cartage shewed, And warned him before of al his grace, And seyde him, what man, lered other lewed, That loveth comun profit, wel y-thewed, He shal unto a blisful place wende, Ther as Ioye is that last withouten ende. Than asked he, if folk that heer be dede Have lyf and dwelling in another place; And African seyde, ‘ye, withoute drede,’ And that our present worldes lyves space Nis but a maner deth, what wey we trace, And rightful folk shal go, after they dye, To heven; and shewed him the galaxye. Than shewed he him the litel erthe, that heer is, At regard of the hevenes quantite; And after shewed he him the nyne speres, And after that the melodye herde he That cometh of thilke speres thryes three, That welle is of musyke and melodye In this world heer, and cause of armonye. Than bad he him, sin erthe was so lyte, And ful of torment and of harde grace, That he ne shulde him in the world delyte. Than tolde he him, in certeyn yeres space, That every sterre shulde come into his place Ther hit was first; and al shulde out of minde That in this worlde is don of al mankinde. Than prayde him Scipioun to telle him al The wey to come un-to that hevene blisse; And he seyde, ‘know thy-self first immortal, And loke ay besily thou werke and wisse To comun profit, and thou shalt nat misse To comen swiftly to that place dere, That ful of blisse is and of soules clere. But brekers of the lawe, soth to seyne, And lecherous folk, after that they be dede, Shul alwey whirle aboute therthe in peyne, Til many a world be passed, out of drede, And than, for-yeven alle hir wikked dede, Than shul they come unto that blisful place, To which to comen god thee sende his grace!’— The day gan failen, and the derke night, That reveth bestes from hir besinesse, Berafte me my book for lakke of light, And to my bedde I gan me for to dresse, Fulfild of thought and besy hevinesse; For bothe I hadde thing which that I nolde, Aud eek I ne hadde that thing that I wolde. But fynally my spirit, at the laste, For-wery of my labour al the day, Took rest, that made me to slepe faste, And in my slepe I mette, as I lay, How African, right in that selfe aray That Scipioun him saw before that tyde, Was comen, and stood right at my beddes syde. The wery hunter, slepinge in his bed, To wode ayein his minde goth anoon; The Iuge dremeth how his plees ben sped; The carter dremeth how his cartes goon; The riche, of gold; the knight fight with his foon, The seke met he drinketh of the tonne; The lover met he hath his lady wonne. Can I nat seyn if that the cause were For I had red of African beforn, That made me to mete that he stood there; But thus seyde he, ‘thou hast thee so wel born In loking of myn olde book to-torn, Of which Macrobie roghte nat a lyte, That somdel of thy labour wolde I quyte!’— Citherea! thou blisful lady swete, That with thy fyr-brand dauntest whom thee lest, And madest me this sweven for to mete, Be thou my help in this, for thou mayst best; As wisly as I saw thee north-north-west, When I began my sweven for to wryte, So yif me might to ryme hit and endyte! The Story. This forseid African me hente anoon, And forth with him unto a gate broghte Right of a parke, walled with grene stoon; And over the gate, with lettres large y-wroghte, Ther weren vers y-writen, as me thoghte, On eyther halfe, of ful gret difference, Of which I shal yow sey the pleyn sentence. ‘Thorgh me men goon in-to that blisful place Of hertes hele and dedly woundes cure; Thorgh me men goon unto the welle of Grace, Ther grene and lusty May shal ever endure; This is the wey to al good aventure; Be glad, thou reder, and thy sorwe of-caste, Al open am I; passe in, and hy the faste!’ ‘Thorgh me men goon,’ than spak that other syde, ‘Unto the mortal strokes of the spere, Of which Disdayn and Daunger is the gyde, Ther tree shal never fruyt ne leves bere. This streem you ledeth to the sorwful were, Ther as the fish in prison is al drye; Theschewing is only the remedye.’ Thise vers of gold and blak y-writen were, The whiche I gan a stounde to beholde, For with that oon encresed ay my fere, And with that other gan myn herte bolde; That oon me hette, that other did me colde, No wit had I, for errour, for to chese, To entre or flee, or me to save or lese. Right as, betwixen adamauntes two Of even might, a pece of iren y-set, That hath no might to meve to ne fro— For what that on may hale, that other let— Ferde I, that niste whether me was bet, To entre or leve, til African my gyde Me hente, and shoof in at the gates wyde, And seyde, ‘hit stondeth writen in thy face, Thyn errour, though thou telle it not to me; But dred thee nat to come in-to this place, For this wryting is no-thing ment by thee, Ne by noon, but he Loves servant be; For thou of love hast lost thy tast, I gesse, As seek man hath of swete and bitternesse. But natheles, al-though that thou be dulle, Yit that thou canst not do, yit mayst thou see; For many a man that may not stonde a pulle, Yit lyketh him at the wrastling for to be, And demeth yit wher he do bet or he; And if thou haddest cunning for tendyte, I shal thee shewen mater of to wryte.’ With that my hond in his he took anoon, Of which I comfort caughte, and wente in faste; But lord! so I was glad and wel begoon! For over-al, wher that I myn eyen caste, Were treës clad with leves that ay shal laste, Eche in his kinde, of colour fresh and grene As emeraude, that Ioye was to sene. The bilder ook, and eek the hardy asshe; The piler elm, the cofre unto careyne; The boxtree piper; holm to whippes lasshe; The sayling firr; the cipres, deth to pleyne; The sheter ew, the asp for shaftes pleyne; The olyve of pees, and eek the drunken vyne, The victor palm, the laurer to devyne. A garden saw I, ful of blosmy bowes, Upon a river, in a grene mede, Ther as that swetnesse evermore y-now is, With floures whyte, blewe, yelowe, and rede; And colde welle-stremes, no-thing dede, That swommen ful of smale fisshes lighte, With finnes rede and scales silver-brighte. On every bough the briddes herde I singe, With voys of aungel in hir armonye, Som besyed hem hir briddes forth to bringe; The litel conyes to hir pley gunne hye, And further al aboute I gan espye The dredful roo, the buk, the hert and hinde, Squerels, and bestes smale of gentil kinde. Of instruments of strenges in acord Herde I so pleye a ravisshing swetnesse, That god, that maker is of al and lord, Ne herde never better, as I gesse; Therwith a wind, unnethe hit might be lesse, Made in the leves grene a noise softe Acordant to the foules songe on-lofte. The air of that place so attempre was That never was grevaunce of hoot ne cold; Ther wex eek every holsom spyce and gras, Ne no man may ther wexe seek ne old; Yet was ther Ioye more a thousand fold Then man can telle; ne never wolde it nighte, But ay cleer day to any mannes sighte. Under a tree, besyde a welle, I say Cupyde our lord his arwes forge and fyle; And at his fete his bowe al redy lay, And wel his doghter tempred al the whyle The hedes in the welle, and with hir wyle She couched hem after as they shulde serve, Som for to slee, and som to wounde and kerve. Tho was I war of Plesaunce anon-right, And of Aray, and Lust, and Curtesye; And of the Craft that can and hath the might To doon by force a wight to do folye— Disfigurat was she, I nil not lye; And by him-self, under an oke, I gesse, Sawe I Delyt, that stood with Gentilnesse. I saw Beautee, withouten any atyr, And Youthe, ful of game and Iolyte, Fool-hardinesse, Flatery, and Desyr, Messagerye, and Mede, and other three— Hir names shul noght here be told for me— And upon pilers grete of Iasper longe I saw a temple of bras y-founded stronge. Aboute the temple daunceden alway Wommen y-nowe, of whiche somme ther were Faire of hem-self, and somme of hem were gay; In kirtels, al disshevele, wente they there— That was hir office alwey, yeer by yere— And on the temple, of doves whyte and faire Saw I sittinge many a hundred paire. Before the temple-dore ful soberly Dame Pees sat, with a curteyn in hir hond: And hir besyde, wonder discretly, Dame Pacience sitting ther I fond With face pale, upon an hille of sond; And alder-next, within and eek with-oute, Behest and Art, and of hir folke a route. Within the temple, of syghes hote as fyr I herde a swogh that gan aboute renne; Which syghes were engendred with desyr, That maden every auter for to brenne Of newe flaume; and wel aspyed I thenne That al the cause of sorwes that they drye Com of the bitter goddesse Ialousye. The god Priapus saw I, as I wente, Within the temple, in soverayn place stonde, In swich aray as whan the asse him shente With crye by night, and with his ceptre in honde; Ful besily men gunne assaye and fonde Upon his hede to sette, of sondry hewe, Garlondes ful of fresshe floures newe. And in a privee corner, in disporte, Fond I Venus and hir porter Richesse, That was ful noble and hauteyn of hir porte; Derk was that place, but afterward lightnesse I saw a lyte, unnethe hit might be lesse, And on a bed of golde she lay to reste, Til that the hote sonne gan to weste. Hir gilte heres with a golden threde Y-bounden were, untressed as she lay, And naked fro the breste unto the hede Men might hir see; and, sothly for to say, The remenant wel kevered to my pay Right with a subtil kerchef of Valence, Ther was no thikker cloth of no defence. The place yaf a thousand savours swote, And Bachus, god of wyn, sat hir besyde, And Ceres next, that doth of hunger bote; And, as I seide, amiddes lay Cipryde, To whom on knees two yonge folkes cryde To ben hir help; but thus I leet hir lye, And ferther in the temple I gan espye That, in dispyte of Diane the chaste, Ful many a bowe y-broke heng on the wal Of maydens, suche as gunne hir tymes waste In hir servyse; and peynted over al Of many a story, of which I touche shal A fewe, as of Calixte and Athalaunte, And many a mayde, of which the name I wante; Semyramus, Candace, and Ercules, Biblis, Dido, Tisbe and Piramus, Tristram, Isoude, Paris, and Achilles, Eleyne, Cleopatre, and Troilus, Silla, and eek the moder of Romulus— Alle these were peynted on that other syde, And al hir love, and in what plyte they dyde. Whan I was come ayen into the place That I of spak, that was so swote and grene, Forth welk I tho, my-selven to solace. Tho was I war wher that ther sat a quene That, as of light the somer-sonne shene Passeth the sterre, right so over mesure She fairer was than any creature. And in a launde, upon an hille of floures, Was set this noble goddesse Nature; Of braunches were hir halles and hir boures, Y-wrought after hir craft and hir mesure; Ne ther nas foul that cometh of engendrure, That they ne were prest in hir presence, To take hir doom and yeve hir audience. For this was on seynt Valentynes day, Whan every foul cometh ther to chese his make, Of every kinde, that men thenke may; And that so huge a noyse gan they make, That erthe and see, and tree, and every lake So ful was, that unnethe was ther space For me to stonde, so ful was al the place. And right as Aleyn, in the Pleynt of Kinde, Devyseth Nature of aray and face, In swich aray men mighten hir ther finde. This noble emperesse, ful of grace, Bad every foul to take his owne place, As they were wont alwey fro yeer to yere, Seynt Valentynes day, to stonden there. That is to sey, the foules of ravyne Were hyest set; and than the foules smale, That eten as hem nature wolde enclyne, As worm, or thing of whiche I telle no tale; But water-foul sat lowest in the dale; And foul that liveth by seed sat on the grene, And that so fele, that wonder was to sene. Ther mighte men the royal egle finde, That with his sharpe look perceth the sonne; And other egles of a lower kinde, Of which that clerkes wel devysen conne. Ther was the tyraunt with his fethres donne And greye, I mene the goshauk, that doth pyne To briddes for his outrageous ravyne. The gentil faucon, that with his feet distreyneth The kinges hond; the hardy sperhauk eke, The quayles foo; the merlion that peyneth Him-self ful ofte, the larke for to seke; Ther was the douve, with hir eyen meke; The Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth; The oule eek, that of dethe the bode bringeth; The crane the geaunt, with his trompes soune; The theef, the chogh; and eek the Iangling pye; The scorning Iay; the eles foo, the heroune; The false lapwing, ful of trecherye; The stare, that the counseyl can bewrye; The tame ruddok; and the coward kyte; The cok, that orloge is of thorpes lyte; The sparow, Venus sone; the nightingale, That clepeth forth the fresshe leves newe; The swalow, mordrer of the flyës smale That maken hony of floures fresshe of hewe; The wedded turtel, with hir herte trewe; The pecok, with his aungels fethres brighte; The fesaunt, scorner of the cok by nighte; The waker goos; the cukkow ever unkinde; The popiniay, ful of delicasye; The drake, stroyer of his owne kinde; The stork, the wreker of avouterye; The hote cormeraunt of glotonye; The raven wys, the crow with vois of care; The throstel olde; the frosty feldefare. What shulde I seyn? of foules every kinde That in this worlde han fethres and stature, Men mighten in that place assembled finde Before the noble goddesse Nature. And everich of hem did his besy cure Benignely to chese or for to take, By hir acord, his formel or his make. But to the poynt—Nature held on hir honde A formel egle, of shap the gentileste That ever she among hir werkes fonde, The most benigne and the goodlieste; In hir was every vertu at his reste, So ferforth, that Nature hir-self had blisse To loke on hir, and ofte hir bek to kisse. Nature, the vicaire of thalmyghty lorde, That hoot, cold, hevy, light, [and] moist and dreye Hath knit by even noumbre of acorde, In esy vois began to speke and seye, ‘Foules, tak hede of my sentence, I preye, And, for your ese, in furthering of your nede, As faste as I may speke, I wol me spede. Ye know wel how, seynt Valentynes day, By my statut and through my governaunce, Ye come for to chese—and flee your way— Your makes, as I prik yow with plesaunce. But natheles, my rightful ordenaunce May I not lete, for al this world to winne, That he that most is worthy shal beginne. The tercel egle, as that ye knowen wel, The foul royal above yow in degree, The wyse and worthy, secree, trewe as stel, The which I formed have, as ye may see, In every part as hit best lyketh me, Hit nedeth noght his shap yow to devyse, He shal first chese and speken in his gyse. And after him, by order shul ye chese, After your kinde, everich as yow lyketh, And, as your hap is, shul ye winne or lese; But which of yow that love most entryketh, God sende him hir that sorest for him syketh.’ And therwith-al the tercel gan she calle, And seyde, ‘my sone, the choys is to thee falle. But natheles, in this condicioun Mot be the choys of everich that is here, That she agree to his eleccioun, Who-so he be that shulde been hir fere; This is our usage alwey, fro yeer to yere; And who so may at this time have his grace, In blisful tyme he com in-to this place.’ With hed enclyned and with ful humble chere This royal tercel spak and taried nought; ‘Unto my sovereyn lady, and noght my fere, I chese, and chese with wille and herte and thought, The formel on your hond so wel y-wrought, Whos I am al and ever wol hir serve, Do what hir list, to do me live or sterve. Beseching hir of mercy and of grace, As she that is my lady sovereyne; Or let me dye present in this place. For certes, long may I not live in peyne; For in myn herte is corven every veyne; Having reward only to my trouthe, My dere herte, have on my wo som routhe. And if that I to hir be founde untrewe, Disobeysaunt, or wilful negligent, Avauntour, or in proces love a newe, I pray to you this be my Iugement, That with these foules I be al to-rent, That ilke day that ever she me finde To hir untrewe, or in my gilte unkinde. And sin that noon loveth hir so wel as I, Al be she never of love me behette, Than oghte she be myn thourgh hir mercy, For other bond can I noon on hir knette. For never, for no wo, ne shal I lette To serven hir, how fer so that she wende; Sey what yow list, my tale is at an ende.’ Right as the fresshe, rede rose newe Ayen the somer-sonne coloured is, Right so for shame al wexen gan the hewe Of this formel, whan she herde al this; She neyther answerde ‘wel,’ ne seyde amis, So sore abasshed was she, til that Nature Seyde, ‘doghter, drede yow noght, I yow assure.’ Another tercel egle spak anoon Of lower kinde, and seyde, ‘that shal not be; I love hir bet than ye do, by seynt Iohn, Or atte leste I love hir as wel as ye; And lenger have served hir, in my degree, And if she shulde have loved for long loving, To me allone had been the guerdoning. I dar eek seye, if she me finde fals, Unkinde, Iangler, or rebel any wyse, Or Ialous, do me hongen by the hals! And but I bere me in hir servyse As wel as that my wit can me suffyse, Fro poynt to poynt, hir honour for to save, Tak she my lyf, and al the good I have.’ The thridde tercel egle answerde tho, ‘Now, sirs, ye seen the litel leyser here; For every foul cryeth out to been a-go Forth with his make, or with his lady dere; And eek Nature hir-self ne wol nought here, For tarying here, noght half that I wolde seye; And but I speke, I mot for sorwe deye. Of long servyse avaunte I me no-thing, But as possible is me to dye to-day For wo, as he that hath ben languisshing Thise twenty winter, and wel happen may A man may serven bet and more to pay In half a yere, al-though hit were no more, Than som man doth that hath served ful yore. I ne say not this by me, for I ne can Do no servyse that may my lady plese; But I dar seyn, I am hir trewest man As to my dome, and feynest wolde hir ese; At shorte wordes, til that deth me sese, I wol ben hires, whether I wake or winke, And trewe in al that herte may bethinke.’ Of al my lyf, sin that day I was born, So gentil plee in love or other thing Ne herde never no man me beforn, Who-[so] that hadde leyser and cunning For to reherse hir chere and hir speking; And from the morwe gan this speche laste Til dounward drow the sonne wonder faste. The noyse of foules for to ben delivered So loude rong, ‘have doon and let us wende!’ That wel wende I the wode had al to-shivered. ‘Come of!’ they cryde, ‘allas! ye wil us shende! Whan shal your cursed pleding have an ende? How shulde a Iuge eyther party leve, For yee or nay, with-outen any preve?’ The goos, the cokkow, and the doke also So cryden ‘kek, kek!’ ‘kukkow!’ ‘quek, quek!’ hye, That thorgh myn eres the noyse wente tho. The goos seyde, ‘al this nis not worth a flye! But I can shape hereof a remedye, And I wol sey my verdit faire and swythe For water-foul, who-so be wrooth or blythe.’ ‘And I for worm-foul,’ seyde the fool cukkow, ‘For I wol, of myn owne auctoritè, For comune spede, take the charge now, For to delivere us is gret charitè.’ ‘Ye may abyde a whyle yet, parde!’ Seide the turtel, ‘if hit be your wille A wight may speke, him were as good be stille. I am a seed-foul, oon the unworthieste, That wot I wel, and litel of kunninge; But bet is that a wightes tonge reste Than entremeten him of such doinge Of which he neyther rede can nor singe. And who-so doth, ful foule himself acloyeth, For office uncommitted ofte anoyeth.’ Nature, which that alway had an ere To murmour of the lewednes behinde, With facound voys seide, ‘hold your tonges there! And I shal sone, I hope, a counseyl finde You to delivere, and fro this noyse unbinde; I Iuge, of every folk men shal oon calle To seyn the verdit for you foules alle.’ Assented were to this conclusioun The briddes alle; and foules of ravyne Han chosen first, by pleyn eleccioun, The tercelet of the faucon, to diffyne Al hir sentence, and as him list, termyne; And to Nature him gonnen to presente, And she accepteth him with glad entente. The tercelet seide than in this manere: ‘Ful hard were hit to preve hit by resoun Who loveth best this gentil formel here; For everich hath swich replicacioun, That noon by skilles may be broght a-doun; I can not seen that arguments avayle; Than semeth hit ther moste be batayle.’ ‘Al redy!’ quod these egles tercels tho. ‘Nay, sirs!’ quod he, ‘if that I dorste it seye, Ye doon me wrong, my tale is not y-do! For sirs, ne taketh noght a-gref, I preye, It may noght gon, as ye wolde, in this weye; Oure is the voys that han the charge in honde, And to the Iuges dome ye moten stonde; And therfor pees! I seye, as to my wit, Me wolde thinke how that the worthieste Of knighthode, and lengest hath used hit, Moste of estat, of blode the gentileste, Were sittingest for hir, if that hir leste; And of these three she wot hir-self, I trowe, Which that he be, for hit is light to knowe.’ The water-foules han her hedes leyd Togeder, and of short avysement, Whan everich had his large golee seyd, They seyden sothly, al by oon assent, How that ‘the goos, with hir facounde gent, That so desyreth to pronounce our nede, Shal telle our tale,’ and preyde ‘god hir spede.’ And for these water-foules tho began The goos to speke, and in hir cakelinge She seyde, ‘pees! now tak kepe every man, And herkeneth which a reson I shal bringe; My wit is sharp, I love no taryinge; I seye, I rede him, though he were my brother, But she wol love him, lat him love another!’ ‘Lo here! a parfit reson of a goos!’ Quod the sperhauk; ‘never mot she thee! Lo, swich hit is to have a tonge loos! Now parde, fool, yet were hit bet for thee Have holde thy pees, than shewed thy nycete! Hit lyth not in his wit nor in his wille, But sooth is seyd, “a fool can noght be stille.”’ The laughter aroos of gentil foules alle, And right anoon the seed-foul chosen hadde The turtel trewe, and gunne hir to hem calle, And preyden hir to seye the sothe sadde Of this matere, and asked what she radde; And she answerde, that pleynly hir entente She wolde shewe, and sothly what she mente. ‘Nay, god forbede a lover shulde chaunge!’ The turtel seyde, and wex for shame al reed; ‘Thogh that his lady ever-more be straunge, Yet let him serve hir ever, til he be deed; For sothe, I preyse noght the gooses reed; For thogh she deyed, I wolde non other make, I wol ben hires, til that the deth me take.’ ‘Wel bourded!’ quod the doke, ‘by my hat! That men shulde alwey loven, causeles, Who can a reson finde or wit in that? Daunceth he mury that is mirtheles? Who shulde recche of that is reccheles? Ye, quek!’ yit quod the doke, ful wel and faire, ‘There been mo sterres, god wot, than a paire!’ ‘Now fy, cherl!’ quod the gentil tercelet, ‘Out of the dunghil com that word ful right, Thou canst noght see which thing is wel be-set: Thou farest by love as oules doon by light, The day hem blent, ful wel they see by night; Thy kind is of so lowe a wrechednesse, That what love is, thou canst nat see ne gesse.’ Tho gan the cukkow putte him forth in prees For foul that eteth worm, and seide blyve, ‘So I,’ quod he, ‘may have my make in pees, I recche not how longe that ye stryve; Lat ech of hem be soleyn al hir lyve, This is my reed, sin they may not acorde; This shorte lesson nedeth noght recorde.’ ‘Ye! have the glotoun fild ynogh his paunche, Than are we wel!’ seyde the merlioun; ‘Thou mordrer of the heysugge on the braunche That broghte thee forth, thou [rewthelees] glotoun! Live thou soleyn, wormes corrupcioun! For no fors is of lakke of thy nature; Go, lewed be thou, whyl the world may dure!’ ‘Now pees,’ quod Nature, ‘I comaunde here; For I have herd al your opinioun, And in effect yet be we never the nere; But fynally, this is my conclusioun, That she hir-self shal han the eleccioun Of whom hir list, who-so be wrooth or blythe, Him that she cheest, he shal hir have as swythe. For sith hit may not here discussed be Who loveth hir best, as seide the tercelet, Than wol I doon hir this favour, that she Shal have right him on whom hir herte is set, And he hir that his herte hath on hir knet. This Iuge I, Nature, for I may not lyë; To noon estat I have non other yë. But as for counseyl for to chese a make, If hit were reson, certes, than wolde I Counseyle yow the royal tercel take, As seide the tercelet ful skilfully, As for the gentilest and most worthy, Which I have wroght so wel to my plesaunce; That to yow oghte been a suffisaunce.’ With dredful vois the formel hir answerde, ‘My rightful lady, goddesse of Nature, Soth is that I am ever under your yerde, Lyk as is everiche other creature, And moot be youres whyl my lyf may dure; And therfor graunteth me my firste bone, And myn entente I wol yow sey right sone.’ ‘I graunte it you,’ quod she; and right anoon This formel egle spak in this degree, ‘Almighty quene, unto this yeer be doon I aske respit for to avysen me. And after that to have my choys al free; This al and som, that I wolde speke and seye; Ye gete no more, al-though ye do me deye. I wol noght serven Venus ne Cupyde For sothe as yet, by no manere wey.’ ‘Now sin it may non other wyse betyde,’ Quod tho Nature, ‘here is no more to sey; Than wolde I that these foules were a-wey Ech with his make, for tarying lenger here’— And seyde hem thus, as ye shul after here. ‘To you speke I, ye tercelets,’ quod Nature, ‘Beth of good herte and serveth, alle three; A yeer is not so longe to endure, And ech of yow peyne him, in his degree, For to do wel; for, god wot, quit is she Fro yow this yeer; what after so befalle, This entremes is dressed for you alle.’ And whan this werk al broght was to an ende, To every foule Nature yaf his make By even acorde, and on hir wey they wende. A! lord! the blisse and Ioye that they make! For ech of hem gan other in winges take, And with hir nekkes ech gan other winde, Thanking alwey the noble goddesse of kinde. But first were chosen foules for to singe, As yeer by yere was alwey hir usaunce To singe a roundel at hir departinge, To do Nature honour and plesaunce. The note, I trowe, maked was in Fraunce; The wordes wer swich as ye may heer finde, The nexte vers, as I now have in minde. Qui bien aime a tard oublie. ‘Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe, That hast this wintres weders over-shake, And driven awey the longe nightes blake! Seynt Valentyn, that art ful hy on-lofte;— Thus singen smale foules for thy sake— Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe, That hast this wintres weders over-shake. Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte, Sith ech of hem recovered hath his make; Ful blisful may they singen whan they wake; Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe, That hast this wintres weders over-shake, And driven awey the longe nightes blake.’ And with the showting, whan hir song was do, That foules maden at hir flight a-way, I wook, and other bokes took me to To rede upon, and yet I rede alway; I hope, y-wis, to rede so som day That I shal mete som thing for to fare The bet; and thus to rede I nil not spare.

The longe night, whan every creature Shulde have hir rest in somwhat, as by kinde, Or elles ne may hir lyf nat long endure, Hit falleth most in-to my woful minde How I so fer have broght my-self behinde, That, sauf the deeth, ther may no-thing me lisse, So desespaired I am from alle blisse. This same thoght me lasteth til the morwe, And from the morwe forth til hit be eve; Ther nedeth me no care for to borwe, For bothe I have good leyser and good leve; Ther is no wight that wol me wo bereve To wepe y-nogh, and wailen al my fille; The sore spark of peyne doth me spille. II.(In Terza Rima; imperfect.) [The sore spark of peyne doth me spille;] This Love hath [eek] me set in swich a place That my desyr [he] never wol fulfille; For neither pitee, mercy, neither grace Can I nat finde; and [fro] my sorwful herte, For to be deed, I can hit nat arace. The more I love, the more she doth me smerte; Through which I see, with-oute remedye, That from the deeth I may no wyse asterte; [For this day in hir servise shal I dye]. III.(In Terza Rima; imperfect.) [Thus am I slain, with sorwes ful dyverse; Ful longe agoon I oghte have taken hede]. Now sothly, what she hight I wol reherse; Hir name is Bountee, set in womanhede, Sadnesse in youthe, and Beautee prydelees, And Plesaunce, under governaunce and drede; Hir surname eek is Faire Rewthelees, The Wyse, y-knit un-to Good Aventure, That, for I love hir, sleeth me giltelees. Hir love I best, and shal, whyl I may dure, Bet than my-self an hundred thousand deel, Than al this worldes richesse or creature. Now hath nat Lovë me bestowed weel To lovë, ther I never shal have part? Allas! right thus is turned me the wheel, Thus am I slayn with loves fyry dart. I can but love hir best, my swete fo; Love hath me taught no more of his art But serve alwey, and stinte for no wo. IV.(In ten-line stanzas.) [With]-in my trewe careful herte ther is So moche wo, and [eek] so litel blis, That wo is me that ever I was bore; For al that thing which I desyre I mis, And al that ever I wolde nat, I-wis, That finde I redy to me evermore; And of al this I not to whom me pleyne. For she that mighte me out of this bringe Ne reccheth nat whether I wepe or singe; So litel rewthe hath she upon my peyne. Allas! whan sleping-time is, than I wake, Whan I shulde daunce, for fere than I quake; [Yow rekketh never wher I flete or sinke;] This hevy lyf I lede for your sake, Thogh ye ther-of in no wyse hede take, [For on my wo yow deyneth not to thinke.] My hertes lady, and hool my lyves quene! For trewly dorste I seye, as that I fele, Me semeth that your swete herte of stele Is whetted now ageynes me to kene. My dere herte, and best beloved fo, Why lyketh yow to do me al this wo, What have I doon that greveth yow, or sayd, But for I serve and love yow and no mo? And whylst I live, I wol do ever so; And therfor, swete, ne beth nat evil apayd. For so good and so fair as [that] ye be, Hit were [a] right gret wonder but ye hadde Of alle servants, bothe goode and badde; And leest worthy of alle hem, I am he. But never-the-les, my righte lady swete, Thogh that I be unconning and unmete To serve as I best coude ay your hynesse. Yit is ther fayner noon, that wolde I hete, Than I, to do yow ese, or elles bete What-so I wiste were to [yow distresse]. And hadde I might as good as I have wille, Than shulde ye fele wher it wer so or noon; For in this worlde living is ther noon That fayner wolde your hertes wil fulfille. For bothe I love, and eek dreed yow so sore, And algates moot, and have doon yow, ful yore, That bet loved is noon, ne never shal; And yit I wolde beseche yow of no more But leveth wel, and be nat wrooth ther-fore, And lat me serve yow forth; lo! this is al. For I am nat so hardy ne so wood For to desire that ye shulde love me; For wel I wot, allas! that may nat be; I am so litel worthy, and ye so good. For ye be oon the worthiest on-lyve, And I the most unlykly for to thryve; Yit, for al this, [now] witeth ye right wele, That ye ne shul me from your service dryve That I nil ay, with alle my wittes fyve, Serve yow trewly, what wo so that I fele. For I am set on yow in swich manere That, thogh ye never wil upon me rewe, I moste yow love, and ever been as trewe As any can or may on-lyve [here]. The more that I love yow, goodly free, The lasse fynde I that ye loven me; Allas! whan shal that harde wit amende? Wher is now al your wommanly pitee, Your gentilesse and your debonairtee, Wil ye no thing ther-of upon me spende? And so hool, swete, as I am youres al, And so gret wil as I have yow to serve, Now, certes, and ye lete me thus sterve, Yit have ye wonne ther-on but a smal. For, at my knowing, I do no-thing why, And this I wol beseche yow hertely, That, ther ever ye finde, whyl ye live, A trewer servant to yow than am I, Leveth [me] thanne, and sleeth me hardely, And I my deeth to you wol al forgive. And if ye finde no trewer [man than me], [Why] will ye suffre than that I thus spille, And for no maner gilt but my good wille? As good wer thanne untrewe as trewe to be. But I, my lyf and deeth, to yow obeye, And with right buxom herte hoolly I preye, As [is] your moste plesure, so doth by me; Wel lever is me lyken yow and deye Than for to any thing or thinke or seye That mighte yow offende in any tyme. And therfor, swete, rewe on my peynes smerte, And of your grace granteth me som drope; For elles may me laste ne blis ne hope, Ne dwellen in my trouble careful herte. VII. ANELIDA AND ARCITE. The compleynt of feire Anelida and fals Arcite. Proem. Thou ferse god of armes, Mars the rede, That in the frosty country called Trace, Within thy grisly temple ful of drede Honoured art, as patroun of that place! With thy Bellona, Pallas, ful of grace, Be present, and my song continue and gye; At my beginning thus to thee I crye. For hit ful depe is sonken in my minde, With pitous herte in English for tendyte This olde storie, in Latin which I finde, Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite, That elde, which that al can frete and byte, As hit hath freten mony a noble storie, Hath nigh devoured out of our memorie. Be favorable eek, thou Polymnia, On Parnaso that, with thy sustres glade, By Elicon, not fer from Cirrea, Singest with vois memorial in the shade, Under the laurer which that may not fade, And do that I my ship to haven winne; First folow I Stace, and after him Corinne. The Story. Iamque domos patrias, &amp;c.; Statii Thebais, xii. 519. Whan Theseus, with werres longe and grete, The aspre folk of Cithe had over-come, With laurer crouned, in his char gold-bete, Hoom to his contre-houses is y-come;— For which the peple blisful, al and somme, So cryden, that unto the sterres hit wente, And him to honouren dide al hir entente;— Beforn this duk, in signe of hy victorie, The trompes come, and in his baner large The image of Mars; and, in token of glorie, Men mighten seen of tresor many a charge, Many a bright helm, and many a spere and targe, Many a fresh knight, and many a blisful route, On hors, on fote, in al the felde aboute. Ipolita his wyf, the hardy quene Of Cithia, that he conquered hadde, With Emelye, hir yonge suster shene, Faire in a char of golde he with him ladde, That al the ground aboute hir char she spradde With brightnesse of the beautee in hir face, Fulfild of largesse and of alle grace. With his triumphe and laurer-crouned thus, In al the floure of fortunes yevinge, Lete I this noble prince Theseus Toward Athenes in his wey rydinge, And founde I wol in shortly for to bringe The slye wey of that I gan to wryte, Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite. Mars, which that through his furious course of yre, The olde wrath of Iuno to fulfille, Hath set the peples hertes bothe on fyre Of Thebes and Grece, everich other to kille With blody speres, ne rested never stille, But throng now her, now ther, among hem bothe, That everich other slough, so wer they wrothe. For whan Amphiorax and Tydeus, Ipomedon, Parthonopee also Were dede, and slayn [was] proud Campaneus, And whan the wrecches Thebans, bretheren two, Were slayn, and king Adrastus hoom a-go, So desolat stood Thebes and so bare, That no wight coude remedie of his care. And whan the olde Creon gan espye How that the blood roial was broght adoun, He held the cite by his tirannye, And did the gentils of that regioun To been his frendes, and dwellen in the toun. So what for love of him, and what for awe, The noble folk wer to the toune y-drawe. Among al these, Anelida the quene Of Ermony was in that toun dwellinge, That fairer was then is the sonne shene; Through-out the world so gan hir name springe, That hir to seen had every wight lykinge; For, as of trouthe, is ther noon hir liche, Of al the women in this worlde riche. Yong was this quene, of twenty yeer of elde, Of midel stature, and of swich fairnesse, That nature had a Ioye hir to behelde; And for to speken of hir stedfastnesse, She passed hath Penelope and Lucresse, And shortly, if she shal be comprehended, In hir ne mighte no-thing been amended. This Theban knight [Arcite] eek, sooth to seyn, Was yong, and ther-with-al a lusty knight, But he was double in love and no-thing pleyn, And subtil in that crafte over any wight, And with his cunning wan this lady bright; For so ferforth he gan hir trouthe assure, That she him [trust] over any creature. What shuld I seyn? she loved Arcite so, That, whan that he was absent any throwe, Anon hir thoghte hir herte brast a-two; For in hir sight to hir he bar him lowe, So that she wende have al his herte y-knowe; But he was fals; it nas but feyned chere, As nedeth not to men such craft to lere. But never-the-les ful mikel besinesse Had he, er that he mighte his lady winne, And swoor he wolde dyen for distresse, Or from his wit he seyde he wolde twinne. Alas, the whyle! for hit was routhe and sinne, That she upon his sorowes wolde rewe, But no-thing thenketh the fals as doth the trewe. Hir fredom fond Arcite in swich manere, That al was his that she hath, moche or lyte, Ne to no creature made she chere Ferther than that hit lyked to Arcite; Ther was no lak with which he mighte hir wyte, She was so ferforth yeven him to plese, That al that lyked him, hit did hir ese. Ther nas to hir no maner lettre y-sent That touched love, from any maner wight, That she ne shewed hit him, er hit was brent; So pleyn she was, and did hir fulle might, That she nil hyden nothing from hir knight, Lest he of any untrouthe hir upbreyde; Withouten bode his heste she obeyde. And eek he made him Ielous over here, That, what that any man had to hir seyd, Anoon he wolde preyen hir to swere What was that word, or make him evel apayd; Than wende she out of hir wit have brayd; But al this nas but sleight and flaterye, Withouten love he feyned Ielosye. And al this took she so debonerly, That al his wille, hir thoghte hit skilful thing, And ever the lenger loved him tenderly, And did him honour as he were a king. Hir herte was wedded to him with a ring; So ferforth upon trouthe is hir entente, That wher he goth, hir herte with him wente. Whan she shal ete, on him is so hir thoght, That wel unnethe of mete took she keep; And whan that she was to hir reste broght, On him she thoghte alwey til that she sleep; Whan he was absent, prevely she weep; Thus liveth fair Anelida the quene For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene. This fals Arcite, of his new-fangelnesse, For she to him so lowly was and trewe, Took lesse deyntee for hir stedfastnesse, And saw another lady, proud and newe, And right anon he cladde him in hir hewe— Wot I not whether in whyte, rede, or grene— And falsed fair Anelida the quene. But never-the-les, gret wonder was hit noon Thogh he wer fals, for hit is kinde of man, Sith Lamek was, that is so longe agoon, To been in love as fals as ever he can; He was the firste fader that began To loven two, and was in bigamye; And he found tentes first, but-if men lye. This fals Arcite sumwhat moste he feyne, Whan he wex fals, to covere his traitorye, Right as an hors, that can both byte and pleyne; For he bar hir on honde of trecherye, And swoor he coude hir doublenesse espye, And al was falsnes that she to him mente; Thus swoor this theef, and forth his way he wente. Alas! what herte might enduren hit, For routhe or wo, hir sorow for to telle? Or what man hath the cunning or the wit? Or what man might with-in the chambre dwelle, If I to him rehersen shal the helle, That suffreth fair Anelida the quene For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene? She wepeth, waileth, swowneth pitously, To grounde deed she falleth as a stoon; Al crampissheth hir limes crokedly, She speketh as hir wit were al agoon; Other colour then asshen hath she noon, Noon other word she speketh moche or lyte, But ‘mercy, cruel herte myn, Arcite!’ And thus endureth, til that she was so mate That she ne hath foot on which she may sustene; But forth languisshing ever in this estate, Of which Arcite hath nother routhe ne tene; His herte was elles-where, newe and grene, That on hir wo ne deyneth him not to thinke, Him rekketh never wher she flete or sinke. His newe lady holdeth him so narowe Up by the brydel, at the staves ende, That every word, he dradde hit as an arowe; Hir daunger made him bothe bowe and bende, And as hir liste, made him turne or wende; For she ne graunted him in hir livinge No grace, why that he hath lust to singe; But drof him forth, unnethe liste hir knowe That he was servaunt to hir ladyshippe, But lest that he wer proude, she held him lowe; Thus serveth he, withouten fee or shipe, She sent him now to londe, now to shippe; And for she yaf him daunger al his fille, Therfor she had him at hir owne wille. Ensample of this, ye thrifty wimmen alle, Take here Anelida and fals Arcite, That for hir liste him ‘dere herte’ calle, And was so meek, therfor he loved hir lyte; The kinde of mannes herte is to delyte In thing that straunge is, also god me save! For what he may not gete, that wolde he have. Now turne we to Anelida ageyn, That pyneth day by day in languisshing; But whan she saw that hir ne gat no geyn, Upon a day, ful sorowfully weping, She caste hir for to make a compleyning, And with hir owne honde she gan hit wryte; And sente hit to hir Theban knight Arcite. The compleynt of Anelida the quene upon fals Arcite. Proem. So thirleth with the poynt of remembraunce, The swerd of sorowe, y-whet with fals plesaunce, Myn herte, bare of blis and blak of hewe, That turned is in quaking al my daunce, My suretee in a-whaped countenaunce; Sith hit availeth not for to ben trewe; For who-so trewest is, hit shal hir rewe, That serveth love and doth hir observaunce Alwey to oon, and chaungeth for no newe. (Strophe.) 1 I wot my-self as wel as any wight; For I loved oon with al my herte and might More then my-self, an hundred thousand sythe, And called him my hertes lyf, my knight, And was al his, as fer as hit was right; And whan that he was glad, than was I blythe, And his disese was my deeth as swythe; And he ayein his trouthe me had plight For ever-more, his lady me to kythe. 2 Now is he fals, alas! and causeles, And of my wo he is so routheles, That with a worde him list not ones deyne To bring ayein my sorowful herte in pees, For he is caught up in a-nother lees. Right as him list, he laugheth at my peyne, And I ne can myn herte not restreyne, That I ne love him alwey, never-the-les; And of al this I not to whom me pleyne. 3 And shal I pleyne—alas! the harde stounde— Un-to my foo that yaf my herte a wounde, And yet desyreth that myn harm be more? Nay, certes! ferther wol I never founde Non other help, my sores for to sounde. My desteny hath shapen it ful yore; I wil non other medecyne ne lore; I wil ben ay ther I was ones bounde, That I have seid, be seid for ever-more! 4 Alas! wher is become your gentilesse! Your wordes ful of plesaunce and humblesse? Your observaunces in so low manere, And your awayting and your besinesse Upon me, that ye calden your maistresse, Your sovereyn lady in this worlde here? Alas! and is ther nother word ne chere Ye vouchesauf upon myn hevinesse? Alas! your love, I bye hit al to dere. 5 Now certes, swete, thogh that ye Thus causeles the cause be Of my dedly adversitee, Your manly reson oghte it to respyte To slee your frend, and namely me, That never yet in no degree Offended yow, as wisly he, That al wot, out of wo my soule quyte! But for I shewed yow, Arcite, Al that men wolde to me wryte, And was so besy, yow to delyte— My honour save—meke, kinde, and free, Therfor ye putte on me the wyte, And of me recche not a myte, Thogh that the swerd of sorow byte My woful herte through your crueltee. 6 My swete foo, why do ye so, for shame? And thenke ye that furthered be your name, To love a newe, and been untrewe? nay! And putte yow in sclaunder now and blame, And do to me adversitee and grame, That love yow most, god, wel thou wost! alway? Yet turn ayeyn, and be al pleyn som day, And than shal this that now is mis be game, And al for-yive, whyl that I live may. (Antistrophe.) 1 Lo! herte myn, al this is for to seyne, As whether shal I preye or elles pleyne? Whiche is the wey to doon yow to be trewe? For either mot I have yow in my cheyne, Or with the dethe ye mot departe us tweyne; Ther ben non other mene weyes newe; For god so wisly on my soule rewe, As verily ye sleen me with the peyne; That may ye see unfeyned of myn hewe. 2 For thus ferforth have I my deth [y]-soght, My-self I mordre with my prevy thoght; For sorow and routhe of your unkindenesse I wepe, I wake, I faste; al helpeth noght; I weyve Ioy that is to speke of oght, I voyde companye, I flee gladnesse; Who may avaunte hir bet of hevinesse Then I? and to this plyte have ye me broght, Withoute gilt; me nedeth no witnesse. 3 And sholde I preye, and weyve womanhede? Nay! rather deth then do so foul a dede, And axe mercy gilteles! what nede? And if I pleyne what lyf that I lede, Yow rekketh not; that know I, out of drede; And if I unto yow myn othes bede For myn excuse, a scorn shal be my mede; Your chere floureth, but hit wol not sede; Ful longe agoon I oghte have take hede. 4 For thogh I hadde yow to-morow ageyn, I might as wel holde Averill fro reyn, As holde yow, to make yow stedfast. Almighty god, of trouthe sovereyn, Wher is the trouthe of man? who hath hit sleyn? Who that hem loveth shal hem fynde as fast As in a tempest is a roten mast. Is that a tame best that is ay feyn To renne away, when he is leest agast? 5 Now mercy, swete, if I misseye, Have I seyd oght amis, I preye? I not; my wit is al aweye. I fare as doth the song of Chaunte-pleure. For now I pleyne, and now I pleye, I am so mased that I deye, Arcite hath born awey the keye Of al my worlde, and my good aventure! For in this worlde nis creature Wakinge, in more discomfiture Then I, ne more sorow endure; And if I slepe a furlong wey or tweye, Than thinketh me, that your figure Before me stant, clad in asure, To profren eft a newe assure For to be trewe, and mercy me to preye. 6 The longe night this wonder sight I drye, And on the day for this afray I dye, And of al this right noght, y-wis, ye recche. Ne never mo myn yën two be drye, And to your routhe and to your trouthe I crye. But welawey! to fer be they to fecche; Thus holdeth me my destinee a wrecche. But me to rede out of this drede or gye Ne may my wit, so weyk is hit, not strecche. Conclusion. Than ende I thus, sith I may do no more, I yeve hit up for now and ever-more; For I shal never eft putten in balaunce My sekernes, ne lerne of love the lore. But as the swan, I have herd seyd ful yore, Ayeins his deth shal singe in his penaunce, So singe I here my destiny or chaunce, How that Arcite Anelida so sore Hath thirled with the poynt of remembraunce! The story continued. Whan that Anelida this woful quene Hath of hir hande writen in this wyse, With face deed, betwixe pale and grene, She fel a-swowe; and sith she gan to ryse, And unto Mars avoweth sacrifyse With-in the temple, with a sorowful chere, That shapen was as ye shal after here. (Unfinished.) VIII. CHAUCERS WORDES UNTO ADAM, HIS OWNE SCRIVEYN. Adam scriveyn, if ever it thee bifalle Boece or Troilus to wryten newe, Under thy lokkes thou most have the scalle, But after my making thou wryte trewe. So ofte a daye I mot thy werk renewe, Hit to correcte and eek to rubbe and scrape; And al is through thy negligence and rape. IX. THE FORMER AGE. A blisful lyf, a paisible and a swete Ledden the peples in the former age; They helde hem payed of fruites, that they ete, Which that the feldes yave hem by usage; They ne were nat forpampred with outrage; Unknowen was the quern and eek the melle; They eten mast, hawes, and swich pounage, And dronken water of the colde welle. Yit nas the ground nat wounded with the plough, But corn up-sprong, unsowe of mannes hond, The which they gniden, and eete nat half y-nough. No man yit knew the forwes of his lond; No man the fyr out of the flint yit fond; Un-korven and un-grobbed lay the vyne; No man yit in the morter spyces grond To clarre, ne to sause of galantyne. No mader, welde, or wood no litestere Ne knew; the flees was of his former hewe; No flesh ne wiste offence of egge or spere; No coyn ne knew man which was fals or trewe; No ship yit karf the wawes grene and blewe; No marchaunt yit ne fette outlandish ware; No trompes for the werres folk ne knewe, No toures heye, and walles rounde or square. What sholde it han avayled to werreye? Ther lay no profit, ther was no richesse, But cursed was the tyme, I dar wel seye, That men first dide hir swety bysinesse To grobbe up metal, lurkinge in darknesse, And in the riveres first gemmes soghte. Allas! than sprong up al the cursednesse Of covetyse, that first our sorwe broghte! Thise tyraunts putte hem gladly nat in pres, No wildnesse, ne no busshes for to winne Ther poverte is, as seith Diogenes, Ther as vitaile is eek so skars and thinne That noght but mast or apples is ther-inne. But, ther as bagges been and fat vitaile, Ther wol they gon, and spare for no sinne With al hir ost the cite for tassaile. Yit were no paleis-chaumbres, ne non halles; In caves and [in] wodes softe and swete Slepten this blissed folk with-oute walles, On gras or leves in parfit quiete. No doun of fetheres, ne no bleched shete Was kid to hem, but in seurtee they slepte; Hir hertes were al oon, with-oute galles, Everich of hem his feith to other kepte. Unforged was the hauberk and the plate; The lambish peple, voyd of alle vyce, Hadden no fantasye to debate, But ech of hem wolde other wel cheryce; No pryde, non envye, non avaryce, No lord, no taylage by no tyrannye; Humblesse and pees, good feith, the emperice, [Fulfilled erthe of olde curtesye.] Yit was not Iupiter the likerous, That first was fader of delicacye, Come in this world; ne Nembrot, desirous To reynen, had nat maad his toures hye. Allas, allas! now may men wepe and crye! For in our dayes nis but covetyse [And] doublenesse, and tresoun and envye, Poysoun, manslauhtre, and mordre in sondry wyse. Finit Etas prima. Chaucers. X. FORTUNE. Balades de visage sanz peinture. I. Le Pleintif countre Fortune. This wrecched worldes transmutacioun, As wele or wo, now povre and now honour, With-outen ordre or wys discrecioun Governed is by Fortunes errour; But natheles, the lak of hir favour Ne may nat don me singen, though I dye, ‘Iay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour:’ For fynally, Fortune, I thee defye! Yit is me left the light of my resoun, To knowen frend fro fo in thy mirour. So muche hath yit thy whirling up and doun Y-taught me for to knowen in an hour. But trewely, no force of thy reddour To him that over him-self hath the maystrye! My suffisaunce shal be my socour: For fynally, Fortune, I thee defye! O Socrates, thou stedfast champioun, She never mighte be thy tormentour; Thou never dreddest hir oppressioun, Ne in hir chere founde thou no savour. Thou knewe wel deceit of hir colour, And that hir moste worshipe is to lye. I knowe hir eek a fals dissimulour: For fynally, Fortune, I thee defye! II. La respounse de Fortune au Pleintif. No man is wrecched, but him-self hit wene, And he that hath him-self hath suffisaunce. Why seystow thanne I am to thee so kene, That hast thy-self out of my governaunce? Sey thus: ‘Graunt mercy of thyn haboundaunce That thou hast lent or this.’ Why wolt thou stryve? What wostow yit, how I thee wol avaunce? And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve! I have thee taught divisioun bi-twene Frend of effect, and frend of countenaunce; Thee nedeth nat the galle of noon hyene, That cureth eyen derke fro hir penaunce; Now seestow cleer, that were in ignoraunce. Yit halt thyn ancre, and yit thou mayst arryve Ther bountee berth the keye of my substaunce: And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve. How many have I refused to sustene, Sin I thee fostred have in thy plesaunce! Woltow than make a statut on thy quene That I shal been ay at thyn ordinaunce? Thou born art in my regne of variaunce, Aboute the wheel with other most thou dryve. My lore is bet than wikke is thy grevaunce, And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve. III. La respounse du Pleintif countre Fortune. Thy lore I dampne, hit is adversitee. My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse! That I thy frendes knowe, I thanke hit thee. Tak hem agayn, lat hem go lye on presse! The negardye in keping hir richesse Prenostik is thou wolt hir tour assayle; Wikke appetyt comth ay before seknesse: In general, this reule may nat fayle. La respounse de Fortune countre le Pleintif. Thou pinchest at my mutabilitee, For I thee lente a drope of my richesse, And now me lyketh to with-drawe me. Why sholdestow my realtee oppresse? The see may ebbe and flowen more or lesse; The welkne hath might to shyne, reyne, or hayle; Right so mot I kythen my brotelnesse. In general, this reule may nat fayle. Lo, thexecucion of the magestee That al purveyeth of his rightwisnesse, That same thing ‘Fortune’ clepen ye, Ye blinde bestes, ful of lewednesse! The hevene hath propretee of sikernesse, This world hath ever resteles travayle; Thy laste day is ende of myn intresse: In general, this reule may nat fayle. Lenvoy de Fortune. Princes, I prey you of your gentilesse, Lat nat this man on me thus crye and pleyne, And I shal quyte you your bisinesse At my requeste, as three of you or tweyne; And, but you list releve him of his peyne, Preyeth his beste frend, of his noblesse, That to som beter estat he may atteyne. Explicit. XI. MERCILES BEAUTE: A TRIPLE ROUNDEL. I. Captivity. Your yën two wol slee me sodenly, I may the beautè of hem not sustene, So woundeth hit through-out my herte kene. And but your word wol helen hastily My hertes wounde, whyl that hit is grene, Your yën two wol slee me sodenly, I may the beautè of hem not sustene. Upon my trouthe I sey yow feithfully, That ye ben of my lyf and deeth the quene; For with my deeth the trouthe shal be sene. Your yën two wol slee me sodenly, I may the beautè of hem not sustene, So woundeth hit through-out my herte kene. II. Rejection. So hath your beautè fro your herte chaced Pitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne; For Daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne. Giltles my deeth thus han ye me purchaced; I sey yow sooth, me nedeth not to feyne; So hath your beautè fro your herte chaced Pitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne. Allas! that nature hath in yow compassed So greet beautè, that no man may atteyne To mercy, though he sterve for the peyne. So hath your beautè fro your herte chaced Pitee, that me ne availeth not to pleyne; For Daunger halt your mercy in his cheyne. III. Escape. Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat, I never thenk to ben in his prison lene; Sin I am free, I counte him not a bene. He may answere, and seye this or that; I do no fors, I speke right as I mene. Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat, I never thenk to ben in his prison lene. Love hath my name y-strike out of his sclat, And he is strike out of my bokes clene For ever-mo; [ther] is non other mene. Sin I fro Love escaped am so fat, I never thenk to ben in his prison lene; Sin I am free, I counte him not a bene. Explicit. XII. TO ROSEMOUNDE. A BALADE. Madame, ye ben of al beautè shryne As fer as cercled is the mappemounde; For as the cristal glorious ye shyne, And lyke ruby ben your chekes rounde. Therwith ye ben so mery and so iocounde, That at a revel whan that I see you daunce, It is an oynement unto my wounde, Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce. For thogh I wepe of teres ful a tyne, Yet may that wo myn herte nat confounde; Your seemly voys that ye so smal out-twyne Maketh my thoght in Ioye and blis habounde. So curteisly I go, with lovë bounde, That to my-self I sey, in my penaunce, Suffyseth me to love you, Rosemounde, Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce. Nas never pyk walwed in galauntyne As I in love am walwed and y-wounde; For which ful ofte I of my-self divyne That I am trewe Tristam the secounde. My love may not refreyd be nor afounde; I brenne ay in an amorous plesaunce. Do what you list, I wil your thral be founde, Thogh ye to me ne do no daliaunce. Tregentil. Chaucer. XIII. TRUTH. Balade de bon conseyl. Flee fro the prees, and dwelle with sothfastnesse, Suffyce unto thy good, though hit be smal; For hord hath hate, and climbing tikelnesse, Prees hath envye, and wele blent overal; Savour no more than thee bihove shal; Werk wel thy-self, that other folk canst rede; And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede. Tempest thee noght al croked to redresse, In trust of hir that turneth as a bal: Gret reste stant in litel besinesse; And eek be war to sporne ageyn an al; Stryve noght, as doth the crokke with the wal. Daunte thy-self, that dauntest otheres dede; And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede. That thee is sent, receyve in buxumnesse, The wrastling for this worlde axeth a fal. Her nis non hoom, her nis but wildernesse: Forth, pilgrim, forth! Forth, beste, out of thy stal! Know thy contree, look up, thank God of al; Hold the hye wey, and lat thy gost thee lede: And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede. Envoy. Therfore, thou vache, leve thyn old wrecchednesse Unto the worlde; leve now to be thral; Crye him mercy, that of his hy goodnesse Made thee of noght, and in especial Draw unto him, and pray in general For thee, and eek for other, hevenlich mede; And trouthe shal delivere, hit is no drede. Explicit Le bon counseill de G. Chaucer. XIV. GENTILESSE. Moral Balade of Chaucer. The firste stok, fader of gentilesse— What man that claymeth gentil for to be, Must folowe his trace, and alle his wittes dresse Vertu to sewe, and vyces for to flee. For unto vertu longeth dignitee, And noght the revers, saufly dar I deme, Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe. This firste stok was ful of rightwisnesse, Trewe of his word, sobre, pitous, and free, Clene of his goste, and loved besinesse, Ageinst the vyce of slouthe, in honestee; And, but his heir love vertu, as dide he, He is noght gentil, thogh he riche seme, Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe. Vyce may wel be heir to old richesse; But ther may no man, as men may wel see, Bequethe his heir his vertuous noblesse; That is appropred unto no degree, But to the firste fader in magestee, That maketh him his heir, that can him queme, Al were he mytre, croune, or diademe. XV. LAK OF STEDFASTNESSE. Balade. Som tyme this world was so stedfast and stable That mannes word was obligacioun, And now hit is so fals and deceivable, That word and deed, as in conclusioun, Ben no-thing lyk, for turned up so doun Is al this world for mede and wilfulnesse, That al is lost for lak of stedfastnesse. What maketh this world to be so variable But lust that folk have in dissensioun? Among us now a man is holde unable, But-if he can, by som collusioun, Don his neighbour wrong or oppressioun. What causeth this, but wilful wrecchednesse, That al is lost, for lak of stedfastnesse? Trouthe is put doun, resoun is holden fable; Vertu hath now no dominacioun, Pitee exyled, no man is merciable. Through covetyse is blent discrecioun; The world hath mad a permutacioun Fro right to wrong, fro trouthe to fikelnesse, That al is lost, for lak of stedfastnesse. Lenvoy to King Richard. O prince, desyre to be honourable, Cherish thy folk and hate extorcioun! Suffre no thing, that may be reprevable To thyn estat, don in thy regioun. Shew forth thy swerd of castigacioun, Dred God, do law, love trouthe and worthinesse, And wed thy folk agein to stedfastnesse. Explicit. XVI. LENVOY DE CHAUCER A SCOGAN. To-broken been the statuts hye in hevene That creat were eternally to dure, Sith that I see the brighte goddes sevene Mow wepe and wayle, and passioun endure, As may in erthe a mortal creature. Allas, fro whennes may this thing procede? Of whiche errour I deye almost for drede. By worde eterne whylom was hit shape That fro the fifte cercle, in no manere, Ne mighte a drope of teres doun escape. But now so wepeth Venus in hir spere, That with hir teres she wol drenche us here. Allas, Scogan! this is for thyn offence! Thou causest this deluge of pestilence. Hast thou not seyd, in blaspheme of this goddes, Through pryde, or through thy grete rakelnesse, Swich thing as in the lawe of love forbode is? That, for thy lady saw nat thy distresse, Therfor thou yave hir up at Michelmesse! Allas, Scogan! of olde folk ne yonge Was never erst Scogan blamed for his tonge! Thou drowe in scorn Cupyde eek to record Of thilke rebel word that thou hast spoken, For which he wol no lenger be thy lord. And, Scogan, thogh his bowe be nat broken, He wol nat with his arwes been y-wroken On thee, ne me, ne noon of our figure; We shul of him have neyther hurt ne cure. Now certes, frend, I drede of thyn unhappe, Lest for thy gilt the wreche of Love procede On alle hem that ben hore and rounde of shape, That ben so lykly folk in love to spede. Than shul we for our labour han no mede; But wel I wot, thou wilt answere and seye: ‘Lo! olde Grisel list to ryme and pleye!’ Nay, Scogan, sey not so, for I mexcuse, God help me so! in no rym, doutelees, Ne thinke I never of slepe wak my muse, That rusteth in my shethe stille in pees. Whyl I was yong, I putte hir forth in prees, But al shal passe that men prose or ryme; Take every man his turn, as for his tyme. Envoy. Scogan, that knelest at the stremes heed Of grace, of alle honour and worthinesse, In thende of which streme I am dul as deed, Forgete in solitarie wildernesse; Yet, Scogan, thenke on Tullius kindenesse, Minne thy frend, ther it may fructifye! Far-wel, and lok thou never eft Love defye! XVII. LENVOY DE CHAUCER A BUKTON. The counseil of Chaucer touching Mariage, which was sent to Bukton. My maister Bukton, whan of Criste our kinge Was axed, what is trouthe or sothfastnesse, He nat a word answerde to that axinge, As who saith: ‘no man is al trewe,’ I gesse. And therfor, thogh I highte to expresse The sorwe and wo that is in mariage, I dar not wryte of hit no wikkednesse, Lest I my-self falle eft in swich dotage. I wol nat seyn, how that hit is the cheyne Of Sathanas, on which he gnaweth ever, But I dar seyn, were he out of his peyne, As by his wille, he wolde be bounde never. But thilke doted fool that eft hath lever Y-cheyned be than out of prisoun crepe, God lete him never fro his wo dissever, Ne no man him bewayle, though he wepe. But yit, lest thou do worse, tak a wyf; Bet is to wedde, than brenne in worse wyse. But thou shalt have sorwe on thy flesh, thy lyf, And been thy wyves thral, as seyn these wyse, And if that holy writ may nat suffyse, Experience shal thee teche, so may happe, That thee were lever to be take in Fryse Than eft to falle of wedding in the trappe. Envoy. This litel writ, proverbes, or figure I sende you, tak kepe of hit, I rede: Unwys is he that can no wele endure. If thou be siker, put thee nat in drede. The Wyf of Bathe I pray you that ye rede Of this matere that we have on honde. God graunte you your lyf frely to lede In fredom; for ful hard is to be bonde. Explicit. XVIII. THE COMPLEYNT OF VENUS. I. (The Lover's worthiness.) Ther nis so hy comfort to my plesaunce, Whan that I am in any hevinesse, As for to have leyser of remembraunce Upon the manhod and the worthinesse, Upon the trouthe, and on the stedfastnesse Of him whos I am al, whyl I may dure; Ther oghte blame me no creature, For every wight preiseth his gentilesse. In him is bountee, wisdom, governaunce Wel more then any mannes wit can gesse; For grace hath wold so ferforth him avaunce That of knighthode he is parfit richesse. Honour honoureth him for his noblesse; Therto so wel hath formed him Nature, That I am his for ever, I him assure, For every wight preiseth his gentilesse. And not-withstanding al his suffisaunce, His gentil herte is of so greet humblesse To me in worde, in werke, in contenaunce, And me to serve is al his besinesse, That I am set in verrey sikernesse. Thus oghte I blesse wel myn aventure, Sith that him list me serven and honoure; For every wight preiseth his gentilesse. II. (Disquietude caused by Jealousy.) Now certes, Love, hit is right covenable That men ful dere bye thy noble thing, As wake a-bedde, and fasten at the table, Weping to laughe, and singe in compleyning, And doun to caste visage and loking, Often to chaungen hewe and contenaunce, Pleyne in sleping, and dremen at the daunce, Al the revers of any glad feling. Ialousye be hanged by a cable! She wolde al knowe through hir espying; Ther doth no wight no-thing so resonable, That al nis harm in hir imagening. Thus dere abought is love in yeving, Which ofte he yiveth with-outen ordinaunce, As sorow ynogh, and litel of plesaunce, Al the revers of any glad feling. A litel tyme his yift is agreable, But ful encomberous is the using; For sotel Ialousye, the deceyvable, Ful often-tyme causeth destourbing. Thus be we ever in drede and suffering, In nouncerteyn we languisshe in penaunce, And han ful often many an hard meschaunce, Al the revers of any glad feling. III. (Satisfaction in Constancy.) But certes, Love, I sey nat in such wyse That for tescape out of your lace I mente; For I so longe have been in your servyse That for to lete of wol I never assente; No force thogh Ialousye me tormente; Suffyceth me to see him whan I may, And therfore certes, to myn ending-day To love him best ne shal I never repente. And certes, Love, whan I me wel avyse On any estat that man may represente, Than have ye maked me, through your franchyse, Chese the best that ever on erthe wente. Now love wel, herte, and look thou never stente; And let the Ielous putte hit in assay That, for no peyne wol I nat sey nay; To love him best ne shal I never repente. Herte, to thee hit oghte y-nogh suffyse That Love so hy a grace to thee sente, To chese the worthiest in alle wyse And most agreable unto myn entente. Seche no ferther, neyther wey ne wente, Sith I have suffisaunce unto my pay. Thus wol I ende this compleynt or lay; To love him best ne shal I never repente. Lenvoy. Princess, receyveth this compleynt in gree, Unto your excellent benignitee Direct after my litel suffisaunce. For eld, that in my spirit dulleth me, Hath of endyting al the soteltee Wel ny bereft out of my remembraunce; And eek to me hit is a greet penaunce, Sith rym in English hath swich scarsitee, To folowe word by word the curiositee Of Graunson, flour of hem that make in Fraunce. XIX. THE COMPLEINT OF CHAUCER TO HIS EMPTY PURSE. To you, my purse, and to non other wight Compleyne I, for ye be my lady dere! I am so sory, now that ye be light; For certes, but ye make me hevy chere, Me were as leef be leyd up-on my bere; For whiche un-to your mercy thus I crye: Beth hevy ageyn, or elles mot I dye! Now voucheth sauf this day, or hit be night, That I of you the blisful soun may here, Or see your colour lyk the sonne bright, That of yelownesse hadde never pere. Ye be my lyf, ye be myn hertes stere, Quene of comfort and of good companye: Beth hevy ageyn, or elles mot I dye! Now purs, that be to me my lyves light, And saveour, as doun in this worlde here, Out of this toune help me through your might, Sin that ye wole nat been my tresorere; For I am shave as nye as any frere. But yit I pray un-to your curtesye: Beth hevy ageyn, or elles mot I dye! Lenvoy de Chaucer. O conquerour of Brutes Albioun! Which that by lyne and free eleccioun Ben verray king, this song to you I sende; And ye, that mowen al our harm amende, Have minde up-on my supplicacioun! XX. PROVERBS. Proverbe of Chaucer. I What shul thise clothes many-fold, Lo! this hote somers day?— After greet heet cometh cold; No man caste his pilche away. II Of al this world the wyde compas Hit wol not in myn armes tweyne.— Who-so mochel wol embrace Litel therof he shal distreyne. APPENDIX. XXI. AGAINST WOMEN UNCONSTANT. Balade. Madame, for your newe-fangelnesse, Many a servaunt have ye put out of grace, I take my leve of your unstedfastnesse, For wel I wot, whyl ye have lyves space, Ye can not love ful half yeer in a place; To newe thing your lust is ever kene; In stede of blew, thus may ye were al grene. Right as a mirour nothing may enpresse, But, lightly as it cometh, so mot it pace, So fareth your love, your werkes bereth witnesse. Ther is no feith that may your herte enbrace; But, as a wedercok, that turneth his face With every wind, ye fare, and that is sene; In stede of blew, thus may ye were al grene. Ye might be shryned, for your brotelnesse, Bet than Dalyda, Creseide or Candace; For ever in chaunging stant your sikernesse, That tache may no wight fro your herte arace; If ye lese oon, ye can wel tweyn purchace; Al light for somer, ye woot wel what I mene, In stede of blew, thus may ye were al grene. Explicit. XXII. AN AMOROUS COMPLEINT. (COMPLEINT DAMOURS.) An amorous Compleint, made at Windsor. I, which that am the sorwefulleste man That in this world was ever yit livinge, And leest recoverer of him-selven can, Beginne thus my deedly compleininge On hir, that may to lyf and deeth me bringe, Which hath on me no mercy ne no rewthe That love hir best, but sleeth me for my trewthe. Can I noght doon ne seye that may yow lyke, [For] certes, now, allas! allas! the whyle! Your plesaunce is to laughen whan I syke, And thus ye me from al my blisse exyle. Ye han me cast in thilke spitous yle Ther never man on lyve mighte asterte; This have I for I lovë you, swete herte! Sooth is, that wel I woot, by lyklinesse, If that it were thing possible to do Tacompte youre beutee and goodnesse, I have no wonder thogh ye do me wo; Sith I, thunworthiest that may ryde or go, Durste ever thinken in so hy a place, What wonder is, thogh ye do me no grace? Allas! thus is my lyf brought to an ende, My deeth, I see, is my conclusioun; I may wel singe, ‘in sory tyme I spende My lyf;’ that song may have confusioun! For mercy, pitee, and deep affeccioun, I sey for me, for al my deedly chere, Alle thise diden, in that, me love yow dere. And in this wyse and in dispayre I live In lovë; nay, but in dispayre I dye! But shal I thus [to] yow my deeth for-give, That causeles doth me this sorow drye? Ye, certes, I! For she of my folye Hath nought to done, although she do me sterve; Hit is nat with hir wil that I hir serve! Than sith I am of my sorowe the cause And sith that I have this, withoute hir reed, Than may I seyn, right shortly in a clause, It is no blame unto hir womanheed Though swich a wrecche as I be for hir deed; [And] yet alwey two thinges doon me dyë, That is to seyn, hir beutee and myn yë. So that, algates, she is the verray rote Of my disese, and of my dethe also; For with oon word she mighte be my bote, If that she vouched sauf for to do so. But [why] than is hir gladnesse at my wo? It is hir wone plesaunce for to take, To seen hir servaunts dyen for hir sake! But certes, than is al my wonderinge, Sithen she is the fayrest creature As to my dome, that ever was livinge, The benignest and beste eek that nature Hath wrought or shal, whyl that the world may dure, Why that she lefte pite so behinde? It was, y-wis, a greet defaute in kinde. Yit is al this no lak to hir, pardee, But god or nature sore wolde I blame; For, though she shewe no pite unto me, Sithen that she doth othere men the same, I ne oughte to despyse my ladies game; It is hir pley to laughen whan men syketh, And I assente, al that hir list and lyketh! Yit wolde I, as I dar, with sorweful herte Biseche un-to your meke womanhede That I now dorste my sharpe sorwes smerte Shewe by worde, that ye wolde ones rede The pleynte of me, the which ful sore drede That I have seid here, through myn unconninge, In any worde to your displesinge. Lothest of anything that ever was loth Were me, as wisly god my soule save! To seyn a thing through which ye might be wroth; And, to that day that I be leyd in grave, A trewer servaunt shulle ye never have; And, though that I on yow have pleyned here, Forgiveth it me, myn owne lady dere! Ever have I been, and shal, how-so I wende, Outher to live or dye, your humble trewe; Ye been to me my ginning and myn ende, Sonne of the sterre bright and clere of hewe, Alwey in oon to love yow freshly newe, By god and by my trouthe, is myn entente; To live or dye, I wol it never repente! This compleynt on seint Valentynes day, Whan every foul [ther] chesen shal his make, To hir, whos I am hool, and shal alwey, This woful song and this compleynt I make, That never yit wolde me to mercy take; And yit wol I [for] evermore her serve And love hir best, although she do me sterve. Explicit. XXIII. A BALADE OF COMPLEYNT. Compleyne ne coude, ne might myn herte never My peynes halve, ne what torment I have, Though that I sholde in your presence ben ever, My hertes lady, as wisly he me save That bountee made, and beutee list to grave In your persone, and bad hem bothe in-fere Ever tawayte, and ay be wher ye were. As wisly he gye alle my Ioyes here As I am youres, and to yow sad and trewe, And ye, my lyf and cause of my good chere, And deeth also, whan ye my peynes newe, My worldes Ioye, whom I wol serve and sewe, My heven hool, and al my suffisaunce, Whom for to serve is set al my plesaunce. Beseching yow in my most humble wyse Taccepte in worth this litel povre dyte, And for my trouthe my service nat despyse, Myn observaunce eek have nat in despyte, Ne yit to long to suffren in this plyte, I yow beseche, myn hertes lady dere, Sith I yow serve, and so wil yeer by yere. ADDITIONS TO ‘THE MINOR POEMS’ IN VOL. I. XXIV. WOMANLY NOBLESSE. Balade that Chaucier made. So hath my herte caught in rémembraunce Your beautè hool, and stedfast governaunce, Your vertues allè, and your hy noblesse, That you to serve is set al my plesaunce; So wel my lykth your womanly contenaunce, Your fresshe fetures and your comlinesse, That, whyl I live, my herte to his maistresse, You hath ful chose, in trew perséveraunce, Never to chaunge, for no maner distresse. And sith I [you] shal do this observaunce Al my lyf, withouten displesaunce, You for to serve with al my besinesse, [Taketh me, lady, in your obeisaunce,] And have me somwhat in your souvenaunce. My woful herte suffreth greet duresse; And [loke] how humbl[el]y, with al simplesse, My wil I cónforme to your ordenaunce, As you best list, my peynes to redresse. Considring eek how I hange in balaunce In your servysè; swich, lo! is my chaunce, Abyding grace, whan that your gentilnesse Of my gret wo list doon allegeaunce, And with your pitè me som wyse avaunce, In ful rebating of my hevinesse; And thinkth, by reson, wommanly noblesse Shuld nat desyre for to doon outrance Ther-as she findeth noon unbuxumnesse. Lenvoye. Auctour of norture, lady of plesaunce, Soveraine of beautè, flour of wommanhede, Take ye non hede unto myn ignoraunce, But this receyveth of your goodlihede, Thinking that I have caught in rémembraunce Your beautè hool, your stedfast governaunce. XXV. COMPLAINT TO MY MORTAL FOE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Al hoolly youres, withouten otheres part! Wherefore? y-wis, that I ne can ne may My service chaungen; thus of al suche art The lerninge I desyre for ever and ay. And evermore, whyl that I live may, In trouthe I wol your servant stille abyde, Although my wo encresè day by day, Til that to me be come the dethes tyde. Seint Valentyne! to you I rénovele My woful lyf, as I can, compleyninge; But, as me thinketh, to you a quarele Right greet I have, whan I, rememberinge Bitwene, how kinde, ayeins the yeres springe, Upon your day, doth ech foul chese his make; And you list not in swich comfórt me bringe, That to her grace my lady shulde me take. Wherfor unto you, Cupide, I beseche, Furth with Venús, noble lusty goddesse, Sith ye may best my sorowe lesse and eche; And I, your man, oppressed with distresse, Can not crye ‘help!’ but to your gentilnesse: So voucheth sauf, sith I, your man, wol dye, My ladies herte in pitè folde and presse, That of my peyne I finde remedye. To your conning, my hertes right princesse, My mortal fo, whiche I best love and serve, I recommaunde my boistous lewednesse. And, for I can not altherbest deserve Your grace, I preye, as he that wol nat swerve, That I may fare the better for my trouthe; Sith I am youres, til deth my herte kerve, On me, your man, now mercy have and routhe. XXVI. COMPLAINT TO MY LODE-STERRE.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Of gretter cause may no wight him compleyne Than I; for love hath set me in swich caas That lasse Ioye and more encrees of peyne Ne hath no man; wherfore I crye ‘allas!’ A thousand tyme, whan I have tyme and space. For she, that is my verray sorowes grounde, Wol with her grace no wyse my sorowes sounde. And that, shulde be my sorowes hertes leche, Is me ageins, and maketh me swich werre, That shortly, [in] al maner thought and speche, Whether it be that I be nigh or ferre, I misse the grace of you, my lode-sterre, Which causeth me on you thus for to crye; And al is it for lakke of remedye. My soverain Ioye thus is my mortal fo; She that shulde causen al my lustinesse List in no wyse of my sorowes saye ‘ho!’ But let me thus darraine, in hevinesse, With woful thoughtes and my grete distresse, The which she might right wele, [at] every tyde, If that her liste, out of my herte gyde. But it is so, that her list, in no wyse, Have pitè on my woful besinesse; And I ne can do no maner servyse That may me torne out of my hevinesse; So woldè god, that she now wolde impresse Right in her herte my trouthe and eek good wille; And let me not, for lakke of mercy, spille. Now wele I woot why thus I smerte sore; For couthe I wele, as othere folkes, feyne, Than neded me to live in peyne no more, But, whan I were from you, unteye my reyne, And, for the tyme, drawe in another cheyne. But woldè god that alle swich were y-knowe, And duely punisshed of hye and lowe. Swich lyf defye I, bothe in thoughte and worde, For yet me were wel lever for to sterve Than in my herte for to make an horde Of any falshood; for, til deth to-kerve My herte and body, shal I never swerve From you, that best may be my fynal cure, But, at your liste, abyde myn aventure; And preye to you, noble seint Valentyne, My ladies herte that ye wolde enbrace, And make her pitè to me more enclyne That I may stonden in her noble grace In hasty tyme, whyl I have lyves space: For yit wiste I never noon, of my lyve, So litel hony in so fayre hyve.</field>

BOOK I. 1 The double sorwe of Troilus to tellen, That was the king Priamus sone of Troye, In lovinge, how his aventures fellen Fro wo to wele, and after out of Ioye, My purpos is, er that I parte fro ye. Thesiphone, thou help me for tendyte Thise woful vers, that wepen as I wryte! 2 To thee clepe I, thou goddesse of torment, Thou cruel Furie, sorwing ever in peyne; Help me, that am the sorwful instrument That helpeth lovers, as I can, to pleyne! For wel sit it, the sothe for to seyne, A woful wight to han a drery fere, And, to a sorwful tale, a sory chere. 3 For I, that god of Loves servaunts serve, Ne dar to Love, for myn unlyklinesse, Preyen for speed, al sholde I therfor sterve, So fer am I fro his help in derknesse; But nathelees, if this may doon gladnesse To any lover, and his cause avayle, Have he my thank, and myn be this travayle! 4 But ye loveres, that bathen in gladnesse, If any drope of pitee in yow be, Remembreth yow on passed hevinesse That ye han felt, and on the adversitee Of othere folk, and thenketh how that ye Han felt that Love dorste yow displese; Or ye han wonne him with to greet an ese. 5 And preyeth for hem that ben in the cas Of Troilus, as ye may after here, That love hem bringe in hevene to solas, And eek for me preyeth to god so dere, That I have might to shewe, in som manere, Swich peyne and wo as Loves folk endure, In Troilus unsely aventure. 6 And biddeth eek for hem that been despeyred In love, that never nil recovered be, And eek for hem that falsly been apeyred Thorugh wikked tonges, be it he or she; Thus biddeth god, for his benignitee, To graunte hem sone out of this world to pace, That been despeyred out of Loves grace. 7 And biddeth eek for hem that been at ese, That god hem graunte ay good perseveraunce, And sende hem might hir ladies so to plese, That it to Love be worship and plesaunce. For so hope I my soule best avaunce, To preye for hem that Loves servaunts be, And wryte hir wo, and live in charitee. 8 And for to have of hem compassioun As though I were hir owene brother dere. Now herkeneth with a gode entencioun, For now wol I gon streight to my matere, In whiche ye may the double sorwes here Of Troilus, in loving of Criseyde, And how that she forsook him er she deyde. 9 It is wel wist, how that the Grekes stronge In armes with a thousand shippes wente To Troyewardes, and the citee longe Assegeden neigh ten yeer er they stente, And, in diverse wyse and oon entente, The ravisshing to wreken of Eleyne, By Paris doon, they wroughten al hir peyne. 10 Now fil it so, that in the toun ther was Dwellinge a lord of greet auctoritee, A gret devyn that cleped was Calkas, That in science so expert was, that he Knew wel that Troye sholde destroyed be, By answere of his god, that highte thus, Daun Phebus or Apollo Delphicus. 11 So whan this Calkas knew by calculinge, And eek by answere of this Appollo, That Grekes sholden swich a peple bringe, Thorugh which that Troye moste been for-do, He caste anoon out of the toun to go; For wel wiste he, by sort, that Troye sholde Destroyed been, ye, wolde who-so nolde. 12 For which, for to departen softely Took purpos ful this forknowinge wyse, And to the Grekes ost ful prively He stal anoon; and they, in curteys wyse, Him deden bothe worship and servyse, In trust that he hath conning hem to rede In every peril which that is to drede. 13 The noyse up roos, whan it was first aspyed, Thorugh al the toun, and generally was spoken, That Calkas traytor fled was, and allyed With hem of Grece; and casten to ben wroken On him that falsly hadde his feith so broken; And seyden, he and al his kin at ones Ben worthy for to brennen, fel and bones. 14 Now hadde Calkas left, in this meschaunce, Al unwist of this false and wikked dede, His doughter, which that was in gret penaunce, For of hir lyf she was ful sore in drede, As she that niste what was best to rede; For bothe a widowe was she, and allone Of any freend, to whom she dorste hir mone. 15 Criseyde was this lady name a-right; As to my dome, in al Troyes citee Nas noon so fair, for passing every wight So aungellyk was hir natyf beautee, That lyk a thing inmortal semed she, As doth an hevenish parfit creature, That doun were sent in scorning of nature. 16 This lady, which that al-day herde at ere Hir fadres shame, his falsnesse and tresoun, Wel nigh out of hir wit for sorwe and fere, In widewes habit large of samit broun, On knees she fil biforn Ector a-doun; With pitous voys, and tendrely wepinge, His mercy bad, hir-selven excusinge. 17 Now was this Ector pitous of nature, And saw that she was sorwfully bigoon, And that she was so fair a creature; Of his goodnesse he gladed hir anoon, And seyde, ‘lat your fadres treson goon Forth with mischaunce, and ye your-self, in Ioye, Dwelleth with us, whyl you good list, in Troye. 18 And al thonour that men may doon yow have, As ferforth as your fader dwelled here, Ye shul han, and your body shal men save, As fer as I may ought enquere or here.’ And she him thonked with ful humble chere, And ofter wolde, and it hadde ben his wille, And took hir leve, and hoom, and held hir stille. 19 And in hir hous she abood with swich meynee As to hir honour nede was to holde; And whyl she was dwellinge in that citee, Kepte hir estat, and bothe of yonge and olde Ful wel beloved, and wel men of hir tolde. But whether that she children hadde or noon, I rede it nought; therfore I lete it goon. 20 The thinges fellen, as they doon of werre, Bitwixen hem of Troye and Grekes ofte; For som day boughten they of Troye it derre, And eft the Grekes founden no thing softe The folk of Troye; and thus fortune on-lofte, And under eft, gan hem to wheelen bothe After hir cours, ay whyl they were wrothe. 21 But how this toun com to destruccioun Ne falleth nought to purpos me to telle; For it were here a long disgressioun Fro my matere, and yow to longe dwelle. But the Troyane gestes, as they felle, In Omer, or in Dares, or in Dyte, Who-so that can, may rede hem as they wryte. 22 But though that Grekes hem of Troye shetten, And hir citee bisegede al a-boute, Hir olde usage wolde they not letten, As for to honoure hir goddes ful devoute; But aldermost in honour, out of doute, They hadde a relik hight Palladion, That was hir trist a-boven everichon. 23 And so bifel, whan comen was the tyme Of Aperil, whan clothed is the mede With newe grene, of lusty Ver the pryme, And swote smellen floures whyte and rede, In sondry wyses shewed, as I rede, The folk of Troye hir observaunces olde, Palladiones feste for to holde. 24 And to the temple, in al hir beste wyse, In general, ther wente many a wight, To herknen of Palladion the servyse; And namely, so many a lusty knight, So many a lady fresh and mayden bright, Ful wel arayed, bothe moste and leste, Ye, bothe for the seson and the feste. 25 Among thise othere folk was Criseyda, In widewes habite blak; but nathelees, Right as our firste lettre is now an A, In beautee first so stood she, makelees; Hir godly looking gladede al the prees. Nas never seyn thing to ben preysed derre, Nor under cloude blak so bright a sterre 26 As was Criseyde, as folk seyde everichoon That hir bihelden in hir blake wede; And yet she stood ful lowe and stille alloon, Bihinden othere folk, in litel brede, And neigh the dore, ay under shames drede, Simple of a-tyr, and debonaire of chere, With ful assured loking and manere. 27 This Troilus, as he was wont to gyde His yonge knightes, ladde hem up and doun In thilke large temple on every syde, Biholding ay the ladyes of the toun, Now here, now there, for no devocioun Hadde he to noon, to reven him his reste, But gan to preyse and lakken whom him leste. 28 And in his walk ful fast he gan to wayten If knight or squyer of his companye Gan for to syke, or lete his eyen bayten On any woman that he coude aspye; He wolde smyle, and holden it folye, And seye him thus, ‘god wot, she slepeth softe For love of thee, whan thou tornest ful ofte! 29 ‘I have herd told, pardieux, of your livinge, Ye lovers, and your lewede observaunces, And which a labour folk han in winninge Of love, and, in the keping, which doutaunces; And whan your preye is lost, wo and penaunces; O verrey foles! nyce and blinde be ye; Ther nis not oon can war by other be.’ 30 And with that word he gan cast up the browe, Ascaunces, ‘lo! is this nought wysly spoken?’ At which the god of love gan loken rowe Right for despyt, and shoop for to ben wroken; He kidde anoon his bowe nas not broken; For sodeynly he hit him at the fulle; And yet as proud a pekok can he pulle. 31 O blinde world, O blinde entencioun! How ofte falleth al theffect contraire Of surquidrye and foul presumpcioun; For caught is proud, and caught is debonaire. This Troilus is clomben on the staire, And litel weneth that he moot descenden. But al-day falleth thing that foles ne wenden. 32 As proude Bayard ginneth for to skippe Out of the wey, so priketh him his corn, Til he a lash have of the longe whippe, Than thenketh he, ‘though I praunce al biforn First in the trays, ful fat and newe shorn, Yet am I but an hors, and horses lawe I moot endure, and with my feres drawe.’ 33 So ferde it by this fers and proude knight; Though he a worthy kinges sone were, And wende no-thing hadde had swiche might Ayens his wil that sholde his herte stere, Yet with a look his herte wex a-fere, That he, that now was most in pryde above, Wex sodeynly most subget un-to love. 34 For-thy ensample taketh of this man, Ye wyse, proude, and worthy folkes alle, To scornen Love, which that so sone can The freedom of your hertes to him thralle; For ever it was, and ever it shal bifalle, That Love is he that alle thing may binde; For may no man for-do the lawe of kinde. 35 That this be sooth, hath preved and doth yet; For this trowe I ye knowen, alle or some, Men reden not that folk han gretter wit Than they that han be most with love y-nome; And strengest folk ben therwith overcome, The worthiest and grettest of degree; This was, and is, and yet men shal it see. 36 And trewelich it sit wel to be so; For alderwysest han ther-with ben plesed; And they that han ben aldermost in wo, With love han ben conforted most and esed; And ofte it hath the cruel herte apesed, And worthy folk maad worthier of name, And causeth most to dreden vyce and shame. 37 Now sith it may not goodly be withstonde, And is a thing so vertuous in kinde, Refuseth not to Love for to be bonde, Sin, as him-selven list, he may yow binde. The yerde is bet that bowen wole and winde Than that that brest; and therfor I yow rede To folwen him that so wel can yow lede. 38 But for to tellen forth in special As of this kinges sone of which I tolde, And leten other thing collateral, Of him thenke I my tale for to holde, Bothe of his Ioye, and of his cares colde; And al his werk, as touching this matere, For I it gan, I wil ther-to refere. 39 With-inne the temple he wente him forth pleyinge, This Troilus, of every wight aboute, On this lady and now on that lokinge, Wher-so she were of toune, or of with-oute: And up-on cas bifel, that thorugh a route His eye perced, and so depe it wente, Til on Criseyde it smoot, and ther it stente. 40 And sodeynly he wex ther-with astoned, And gan hire bet biholde in thrifty wyse: ‘O mercy, god!’ thoughte he, ‘wher hastow woned, That art so fair and goodly to devyse?’ Ther-with his herte gan to sprede and ryse, And softe sighed, lest men mighte him here, And caughte a-yein his firste pleyinge chere. 41 She nas not with the leste of hir stature, But alle hir limes so wel answeringe Weren to womanhode, that creature Was neuer lasse mannish in seminge. And eek the pure wyse of here meninge Shewede wel, that men might in hir gesse Honour, estat, and wommanly noblesse. 42 To Troilus right wonder wel with-alle Gan for to lyke hir mening and hir chere, Which somdel deynous was, for she leet falle Hir look a lite a-side, in swich manere, Ascaunces, ‘what! may I not stonden here?’ And after that hir loking gan she lighte, That never thoughte him seen so good a sighte. 43 And of hir look in him ther gan to quiken So greet desir, and swich affeccioun, That in his hertes botme gan to stiken Of hir his fixe and depe impressioun: And though he erst hadde poured up and doun, He was tho glad his hornes in to shrinke; Unnethes wiste he how to loke or winke. 44 Lo, he that leet him-selven so konninge, And scorned hem that loves peynes dryen, Was ful unwar that love hadde his dwellinge With-inne the subtile stremes of hir yën; That sodeynly him thoughte he felte dyen, Right with hir look, the spirit in his herte; Blessed be love, that thus can folk converte! 45 She, this in blak, lykinge to Troylus, Over alle thyng he stood for to biholde; Ne his desir, ne wherfor he stood thus, He neither chere made, ne worde tolde; But from a-fer, his maner for to holde, On other thing his look som-tyme he caste, And eft on hir, whyl that servyse laste. 46 And after this, not fulliche al awhaped, Out of the temple al esiliche he wente, Repentinge him that he hadde ever y-iaped Of loves folk, lest fully the descente Of scorn fille on him-self; but, what he mente, Lest it were wist on any maner syde, His wo he gan dissimulen and hyde. 47 Whan he was fro the temple thus departed, He streyght anoon un-to his paleys torneth, Right with hir look thurgh-shoten and thurgh-darted, Al feyneth he in lust that he soiorneth; And al his chere and speche also he borneth; And ay, of loves servants every whyle, Him-self to wrye, at hem he gan to smyle. 48 And seyde, ‘lord, so ye live al in lest, Ye loveres! for the conningest of yow, That serveth most ententiflich and best, Him tit as often harm ther-of as prow; Your hyre is quit ayein, ye, god wot how! Nought wel for wel, but scorn for good servyse; In feith, your ordre is ruled in good wyse! 49 In noun-certeyn ben alle your observaunces, But it a sely fewe poyntes be; Ne no-thing asketh so grete attendaunces As doth your lay, and that knowe alle ye; But that is not the worste, as mote I thee; But, tolde I yow the worste poynt, I leve, Al seyde I sooth, ye wolden at me greve! 50 But tak this, that ye loveres ofte eschuwe, Or elles doon of good entencioun, Ful ofte thy lady wole it misconstrue, And deme it harm in hir opinioun; And yet if she, for other enchesoun, Be wrooth, than shalt thou han a groyn anoon: Lord! wel is him that may be of yow oon!’ 51 But for al this, whan that he say his tyme, He held his pees, non other bote him gayned; For love bigan his fetheres so to lyme, That wel unnethe un-to his folk he feyned That othere besye nedes him destrayned; For wo was him, that what to doon he niste, But bad his folk to goon wher that hem liste. 52 And whan that he in chaumbre was allone, He doun up-on his beddes feet him sette, And first he gan to syke, and eft to grone, And thoughte ay on hir so, with-outen lette, That, as he sat and wook, his spirit mette That he hir saw a temple, and al the wyse Right of hir loke, and gan it newe avyse. 53 Thus gan he make a mirour of his minde, In which he saugh al hoolly hir figure; And that he wel coude in his herte finde, It was to him a right good aventure To love swich oon, and if he dide his cure To serven hir, yet mighte he falle in grace, Or elles, for oon of hir servaunts pace. 54 Imagininge that travaille nor grame Ne mighte, for so goodly oon, be lorn As she, ne him for his desir ne shame, Al were it wist, but in prys and up-born Of alle lovers wel more than biforn; Thus argumented he in his ginninge, Ful unavysed of his wo cominge. 55 Thus took he purpos loves craft to suwe, And thoughte he wolde werken prively, First, to hyden his desir in muwe From every wight y-born, al-outrely, But he mighte ought recovered be therby; Remembring him, that love to wyde y-blowe Yelt bittre fruyt, though swete seed be sowe. 56 And over al this, yet muchel more he thoughte What for to speke, and what to holden inne, And what to arten hir to love he soughte, And on a song anoon-right to biginne, And gan loude on his sorwe for to winne; For with good hope he gan fully assente Criseyde for to love, and nought repente. 57 And of his song nought only the sentence, As writ myn autour called Lollius, But pleynly, save our tonges difference, I dar wel sayn, in al that Troilus Seyde in his song; lo! every word right thus As I shal seyn; and who-so list it here, Lo! next this vers, he may it finden here. Cantus Troili. 58 ‘If no love is, O god, what fele I so? And if love is, what thing and whiche is he! If love be good, from whennes comth my wo? If it be wikke, a wonder thinketh me, Whenne every torment and adversitee That cometh of him, may to me savory thinke; For ay thurst I, the more that I it drinke. 59 And if that at myn owene lust I brenne, Fro whennes cometh my wailing and my pleynte? If harme agree me, wher-to pleyne I thenne? I noot, ne why unwery that I feynte. O quike deeth, o swete harm so queynte, How may of thee in me swich quantitee, But-if that I consente that it be? 60 And if that I consente, I wrongfully Compleyne, y-wis; thus possed to and fro, Al sterelees with-inne a boot am I A-mid the see, by-twixen windes two, That in contrarie stonden ever-mo. Allas! what is this wonder maladye? For hete of cold, for cold of hete, I deye.’ 61 And to the god of love thus seyde he With pitous voys, ‘O lord, now youres is My spirit, which that oughte youres be. Yow thanke I, lord, that han me brought to this; But whether goddesse or womman, y-wis, She be, I noot, which that ye do me serve; But as hir man I wole ay live and sterve. 62 Ye stonden in hire eyen mightily, As in a place un-to your vertu digne; Wherfore, lord, if my servyse or I May lyke yow, so beth to me benigne; For myn estat royal here I resigne In-to hir hond, and with ful humble chere Bicome hir man, as to my lady dere.’ 63 In him ne deyned sparen blood royal The fyr of love, wher-fro god me blesse, Ne him forbar in no degree, for al His vertu or his excellent prowesse; But held him as his thral lowe in distresse, And brende him so in sondry wyse ay newe, That sixty tyme a day he loste his hewe. 64 So muche, day by day, his owene thought, For lust to hir, gan quiken and encrese, That every other charge he sette at nought; For-thy ful ofte, his hote fyr to cese, To seen hir goodly look he gan to prese; For ther-by to ben esed wel he wende, And ay the ner he was, the more he brende. 65 For ay the ner the fyr, the hotter is, This, trowe I, knoweth al this companye. But were he fer or neer, I dar seye this, By night or day, for wysdom or folye, His herte, which that is his brestes yë, Was ay on hir, that fairer was to sene Than ever was Eleyne or Polixene. 66 Eek of the day ther passed nought an houre That to him-self a thousand tyme he seyde, ‘Good goodly, to whom serve I and laboure, As I best can, now wolde god, Criseyde, Ye wolden on me rewe er that I deyde! My dere herte, allas! myn hele and hewe And lyf is lost, but ye wole on me rewe.’ 67 Alle othere dredes weren from him fledde, Bothe of the assege and his savacioun; Ne in him desyr noon othere fownes bredde But arguments to this conclusioun, That she on him wolde han compassioun, And he to be hir man, whyl he may dure; Lo, here his lyf, and from the deeth his cure! 68 The sharpe shoures felle of armes preve, That Ector or his othere bretheren diden, Ne made him only ther-fore ones meve; And yet was he, wher-so men wente or riden, Founde oon the best, and lengest tyme abiden Ther peril was, and dide eek such travayle In armes, that to thenke it was mervayle. 69 But for non hate he to the Grekes hadde, Ne also for the rescous of the toun, Ne made him thus in armes for to madde, But only, lo, for this conclusioun, To lyken hir the bet for his renoun; Fro day to day in armes so he spedde, That alle the Grekes as the deeth him dredde. 70 And fro this forth tho refte him love his sleep, And made his mete his foo; and eek his sorwe Gan multiplye, that, who-so toke keep, It shewed in his hewe, bothe eve and morwe; Therfor a title he gan him for to borwe Of other syknesse, lest of him men wende That the hote fyr of love him brende. 71 And seyde, he hadde a fever and ferde amis; But how it was, certayn, can I not seye, If that his lady understood not this, Or feyned hir she niste, oon of the tweye; But wel I rede that, by no maner weye, Ne semed it [as] that she of him roughte, Nor of his peyne, or what-so-ever he thoughte. 72 But than fel to this Troylus such wo, That he was wel neigh wood; for ay his drede Was this, that she som wight had loved so, That never of him she wolde have taken hede; For whiche him thoughte he felte his herte blede. Ne of his wo ne dorste he not biginne To tellen it, for al this world to winne. 73 But whanne he hadde a space fro his care, Thus to him-self ful ofte he gan to pleyne; He sayde, ‘O fool, now art thou in the snare, That whilom Iapedest at loves peyne; Now artow hent, now gnaw thyn owene cheyne; Thou were ay wont eche lovere reprehende Of thing fro which thou canst thee nat defende. 74 What wole now every lover seyn of thee, If this be wist, but ever in thyn absence Laughen in scorn, and seyn, “lo, ther gooth he, That is the man of so gret sapience, That held us loveres leest in reverence! Now, thonked be god, he may goon in the daunce Of hem that Love list febly for to avaunce! 75 But, O thou woful Troilus, god wolde, Sin thow most loven thurgh thy destinee, That thow beset were on swich oon that sholde Knowe al thy wo, al lakkede hir pitee: But al so cold in love, towardes thee, Thy lady is, as frost in winter mone, And thou fordoon, as snow in fyr is sone.” 76 God wolde I were aryved in the port Of deeth, to which my sorwe wil me lede! A, lord, to me it were a greet comfort; Then were I quit of languisshing in drede. For by myn hidde sorwe y-blowe on brede I shal bi-Iaped been a thousand tyme More than that fool of whos folye men ryme. 77 But now help god, and ye, swete, for whom I pleyne, y-caught, ye, never wight so faste! O mercy, dere herte, and help me from The deeth, for I, whyl that my lyf may laste, More than my-self wol love yow to my laste. And with som freendly look gladeth me, swete, Though never more thing ye me bi-hete!’ 78 This wordes and ful manye an-other to He spak, and called ever in his compleynte Hir name, for to tellen hir his wo, Til neigh that he in salte teres dreynte. Al was for nought, she herde nought his pleynte; And whan that he bithoughte on that folye, A thousand fold his wo gan multiplye. 79 Bi-wayling in his chambre thus allone, A freend of his, that called was Pandare, Com ones in unwar, and herde him grone, And sey his freend in swich distresse and care: ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘who causeth al this fare? O mercy, god! what unhap may this mene? Han now thus sone Grekes maad yow lene? 80 Or hastow som remors of conscience, And art now falle in som devocioun, And waylest for thy sinne and thyn offence, And hast for ferde caught attricioun? God save hem that bi-seged han our toun, And so can leye our Iolyte on presse, And bring our lusty folk to holinesse!’ 81 These wordes seyde he for the nones alle, That with swich thing he mighte him angry maken, And with an angre don his sorwe falle, As for the tyme, and his corage awaken; But wel he wiste, as fer as tonges spaken, Ther nas a man of gretter hardinesse Than he, ne more desired worthinesse. 82 ‘What cas,’ quod Troilus, ‘or what aventure Hath gyded thee to see my languisshinge, That am refus of euery creature? But for the love of god, at my preyinge, Go henne a-way, for certes, my deyinge Wol thee disese, and I mot nedes deye; Ther-for go wey, ther is no more to seye. 83 But if thou wene I be thus syk for drede, It is not so, and ther-for scorne nought; Ther is a-nother thing I take of hede Wel more than ought the Grekes han y-wrought, Which cause is of my deeth, for sorwe and thought. But though that I now telle thee it ne leste, Be thou nought wrooth, I hyde it for the beste.’ 84 This Pandare, that neigh malt for wo and routhe, Ful often seyde, ‘allas! what may this be? Now freend,’ quod he, ‘if ever love or trouthe Hath been, or is, bi-twixen thee and me, Ne do thou never swiche a crueltee To hyde fro thy freend so greet a care; Wostow nought wel that it am I, Pandare? 85 I wole parten with thee al thy peyne, If it be so I do thee no comfort, As it is freendes right, sooth for to seyne, To entreparten wo, as glad desport. I have, and shal, for trewe or fals report, In wrong and right y-loved thee al my lyve; Hyd not thy wo fro me, but telle it blyve.’ 86 Than gan this sorwful Troilus to syke, And seyde him thus, ‘god leve it be my beste To telle it thee; for, sith it may thee lyke, Yet wole I telle it, though myn herte breste; And wel wot I thou mayst do me no reste. But lest thow deme I truste not to thee, Now herkne, freend, for thus it stant with me. 87 Love, a-yeins the which who-so defendeth Him-selven most, him alder-lest avayleth, With desespeir so sorwfully me offendeth, That streyght un-to the deeth myn herte sayleth. Ther-to desyr so brenningly me assayleth, That to ben slayn it were a gretter Ioye To me than king of Grece been and Troye! 88 Suffiseth this, my fulle freend Pandare, That I have seyd, for now wostow my wo; And for the love of god, my colde care So hyd it wel, I telle it never to mo; For harmes mighte folwen, mo than two, If it were wist; but be thou in gladnesse, And lat me sterve, unknowe, of my distresse.’ 89 ‘How hastow thus unkindely and longe Hid this fro me, thou fool?’ quod Pandarus; ‘Paraunter thou might after swich oon longe, That myn avys anoon may helpen us.’ ‘This were a wonder thing,’ quod Troylus, ‘Thou coudest never in love thy-selven wisse; How devel maystow bringen me to blisse?’ 90 ‘Ye, Troilus, now herke,’ quod Pandare, ‘Though I be nyce; it happeth ofte so, That oon that exces doth ful yvele fare, By good counseyl can kepe his freend ther-fro. I have my-self eek seyn a blind man go Ther-as he fel that coude loke wyde; A fool may eek a wys man ofte gyde. 91 A whetston is no kerving instrument, And yet it maketh sharpe kerving-tolis. And ther thow woost that I have ought miswent, Eschewe thou that, for swich thing to thee scole is; Thus ofte wyse men ben war by folis. If thou do so, thy wit is wel biwared; By his contrarie is every thing declared. 92 For how might ever sweetnesse have be knowe To him that never tasted bitternesse? Ne no man may be inly glad, I trowe, That never was in sorwe or som distresse; Eek whyt by blak, by shame eek worthinesse, Ech set by other, more for other semeth; As men may see; and so the wyse it demeth. 93 Sith thus of two contraries is a lore, I, that have in love so ofte assayed Grevaunces, oughte conne, and wel the more Counsayllen thee of that thou art amayed. Eek thee ne oughte nat ben yvel apayed, Though I desyre with thee for to bere Thyn hevy charge; it shal the lasse dere. 94 I woot wel that it fareth thus by me As to thy brother Parys an herdesse, Which that y-cleped was Oënone, Wrot in a compleynt of hir hevinesse: Ye say the lettre that she wroot, y gesse?’ Nay, never yet, y-wis,’ quod Troilus. ‘Now,’ quod Pandare, ‘herkneth; it was thus.— 95 “Phebus, that first fond art of medicyne,” Quod she, “and coude in every wightes care Remede and reed, by herbes he knew fyne, Yet to him-self his conninge was ful bare; For love hadde him so bounden in a snare, Al for the doughter of the kinge Admete, That al his craft ne coude his sorwe bete.”— 96 Right so fare I, unhappily for me; I love oon best, and that me smerteth sore; And yet, paraunter, can I rede thee, And not my-self; repreve me no more. I have no cause, I woot wel, for to sore As doth an hauk that listeth for to pleye, But to thyn help yet somwhat can I seye. 97 And of o thing right siker maystow be, That certayn, for to deyen in the peyne, That I shal never-mo discoveren thee; Ne, by my trouthe, I kepe nat restreyne Thee fro thy love, thogh that it were Eleyne, That is thy brotheres wyf, if ich it wiste; Be what she be, and love hir as thee liste. 98 Therfore, as freend fullich in me assure, And tel me plat what is thyn enchesoun, And final cause of wo that ye endure; For douteth no-thing, myn entencioun Nis nought to yow of reprehencioun, To speke as now, for no wight may bireve A man to love, til that him list to leve. 99 And witeth wel, that bothe two ben vyces, Mistrusten alle, or elles alle leve; But wel I woot, the mene of it no vyce is, For for to trusten sum wight is a preve Of trouthe, and for-thy wolde I fayn remeve Thy wrong conceyte, and do thee som wight triste, Thy wo to telle; and tel me, if thee liste. 100 The wyse seyth, “wo him that is allone, For, and he falle, he hath noon help to ryse;” And sith thou hast a felawe, tel thy mone; For this nis not, certeyn, the nexte wyse To winnen love, as techen us the wyse, To walwe and wepe as Niobe the quene, Whos teres yet in marbel been y-sene. 101 Lat be thy weping and thy drerinesse, And lat us lissen wo with other speche; So may thy woful tyme seme lesse. Delyte not in wo thy wo to seche, As doon thise foles that hir sorwes eche With sorwe, whan they han misaventure, And listen nought to seche hem other cure. 102 Men seyn, “to wrecche is consolacioun To have an-other felawe in his peyne;” That oughte wel ben our opinioun, For, bothe thou and I, of love we pleyne; So ful of sorwe am I, soth for to seyne, That certeynly no more harde grace May sitte on me, for-why ther is no space. 103 If god wole thou art not agast of me, Lest I wolde of thy lady thee bigyle, Thow wost thy-self whom that I love, pardee, As I best can, gon sithen longe whyle. And sith thou wost I do it for no wyle, And sith I am he that thou tristest most, Tel me sumwhat, sin al my wo thou wost.’ 104 Yet Troilus, for al this, no word seyde, But longe he lay as stille as he ded were; And after this with sykinge he abreyde, And to Pandarus voys he lente his ere, And up his eyen caste he, that in fere Was Pandarus, lest that in frenesye He sholde falle, or elles sone dye: 105 And cryde ‘a-wake’ ful wonderly and sharpe; ‘What? slombrestow as in a lytargye? Or artow lyk an asse to the harpe, That hereth soun, whan men the strenges plye, But in his minde of that no melodye May sinken, him to glade, for that he So dul is of his bestialitee?’ 106 And with that Pandare of his wordes stente; But Troilus yet him no word answerde, For-why to telle nas not his entente To never no man, for whom that he so ferde. For it is seyd, ‘man maketh ofte a yerde With which the maker is him-self y-beten In sondry maner,’ as thise wyse treten, 107 And namely, in his counseyl tellinge That toucheth love that oughte be secree; For of him-self it wolde y-nough out-springe, But-if that it the bet governed be. Eek som-tyme it is craft to seme flee Fro thing which in effect men hunte faste; Al this gan Troilus in his herte caste. 108 But nathelees, whan he had herd him crye ‘Awake!’ he gan to syke wonder sore, And seyde, ‘freend, though that I stille lye, I am not deef; now pees, and cry no more; For I have herd thy wordes and thy lore; But suffre me my mischef to biwayle, For thy proverbes may me nought avayle. 109 Nor other cure canstow noon for me. Eek I nil not be cured, I wol deye; What knowe I of the quene Niobe? Lat be thyne olde ensaumples, I thee preye.’ ‘No,’ quod tho Pandarus, ‘therfore I seye, Swich is delyt of foles to biwepe Hir wo, but seken bote they ne kepe. 110 Now knowe I that ther reson in thee fayleth. But tel me, if I wiste what she were For whom that thee al this misaunter ayleth? Dorstestow that I tolde hir in hir ere Thy wo, sith thou darst not thy-self for fere, And hir bisoughte on thee to han som routhe?’ ‘Why, nay,’ quod he, ‘by god and by my trouthe!’ 111 ‘What? not as bisily,’ quod Pandarus, ‘As though myn owene lyf lay on this nede?’ ‘No, certes, brother,’ quod this Troilus. ‘And why?’—‘For that thou sholdest never spede.’ ‘Wostow that wel?’—‘Ye, that is out of drede,’ Quod Troilus, ‘for al that ever ye conne, She nil to noon swich wrecche as I be wonne.’ 112 Quod Pandarus, ‘allas! what may this be, That thou despeyred art thus causelees? What? liveth not thy lady? benedicite! How wostow so that thou art gracelees? Swich yvel is not alwey botelees. Why, put not impossible thus thy cure, Sin thing to come is ofte in aventure. 113 I graunte wel that thou endurest wo As sharp as doth he, Ticius, in helle, Whos stomak foules tyren ever-mo That highte volturis, as bokes telle. But I may not endure that thou dwelle In so unskilful an opinioun That of thy wo is no curacioun. 114 But ones niltow, for thy coward herte, And for thyn ire and folish wilfulnesse, For wantrust, tellen of thy sorwes smerte, Ne to thyn owene help do bisinesse As muche as speke a resoun more or lesse, But lyest as he that list of no-thing recche. What womman coude love swich a wrecche? 115 What may she demen other of thy deeth, If thou thus deye, and she not why it is, But that for fere is yolden up thy breeth, For Grekes han biseged us, y-wis? Lord, which a thank than shaltow han of this! Thus wol she seyn, and al the toun at ones, “The wrecche is deed, the devel have his bones!” 116 Thou mayst allone here wepe and crye and knele; But, love a woman that she woot it nought, And she wol quyte that thou shalt not fele; Unknowe, unkist, and lost that is un-sought. What! many a man hath love ful dere y-bought Twenty winter that his lady wiste, That never yet his lady mouth he kiste. 117 What? shulde he therfor fallen in despeyr, Or be recreaunt for his owene tene, Or sleen him-self, al be his lady fayr? Nay, nay, but ever in oon be fresh and grene To serve and love his dere hertes quene, And thenke it is a guerdoun hir to serve A thousand-fold more than he can deserve.’ 118 And of that word took hede Troilus, And thoughte anoon what folye he was inne, And how that sooth him seyde Pandarus, That for to sleen him-self mighte he not winne, But bothe doon unmanhod and a sinne, And of his deeth his lady nought to wyte; For of his wo, god woot, she knew ful lyte. 119 And with that thought he gan ful sore syke, And seyde, ‘allas! what is me best to do?’ To whom Pandare answerde, ‘if thee lyke, The best is that thou telle me thy wo; And have my trouthe, but thou it finde so, I be thy bote, or that it be ful longe, To peces do me drawe, and sithen honge!’ 120 ‘Ye, so thou seyst,’ quod Troilus tho, ‘allas! But, god wot, it is not the rather so; Ful hard were it to helpen in this cas, For wel finde I that Fortune is my fo, Ne alle the men that ryden conne or go May of hir cruel wheel the harm withstonde; For, as hir list, she pleyeth with free and bonde.’ 121 Quod Pandarus, ‘than blamestow Fortune For thou art wrooth, ye, now at erst I see; Wostow nat wel that Fortune is commune To every maner wight in som degree? And yet thou hast this comfort, lo, pardee! That, as hir Ioyes moten over-goon, So mote hir sorwes passen everichoon. 122 For if hir wheel stinte any-thing to torne, Than cessed she Fortune anoon to be: Now, sith hir wheel by no wey may soiorne, What wostow if hir mutabilitee Right as thy-selven list, wol doon by thee, Or that she be not fer fro thyn helpinge? Paraunter, thou hast cause for to singe! 123 And therfor wostow what I thee beseche? Lat be thy wo and turning to the grounde; For who-so list have helping of his leche, To him bihoveth first unwrye his wounde. To Cerberus in helle ay be I bounde, Were it for my suster, al thy sorwe, By my wil, she sholde al be thyn to-morwe. 124 Loke up, I seye, and tel me what she is Anoon, that I may goon aboute thy nede; Knowe ich hir ought? for my love, tel me this; Than wolde I hopen rather for to spede.’ Tho gan the veyne of Troilus to blede, For he was hit, and wex al reed for shame; ‘A ha!’ quod Pandare, ‘here biginneth game!’ 125 And with that word he gan him for to shake, And seyde, ‘theef, thou shalt hir name telle.’ But tho gan sely Troilus for to quake As though men sholde han lad him in-to helle, And seyde, ‘allas! of al my wo the welle, Than is my swete fo called Criseyde!’ And wel nigh with the word for fere he deyde. 126 And whan that Pandare herde hir name nevene, Lord, he was glad, and seyde, ‘freend so dere, Now fare a-right, for Ioves name in hevene, Love hath biset the wel, be of good chere; For of good name and wysdom and manere She hath y-nough, and eek of gentilesse; If she be fayr, thow wost thy-self, I gesse. 127 Ne I never saw a more bountevous Of hir estat, ne a gladder, ne of speche A freendlier, ne a more gracious For to do wel, ne lasse hadde nede to seche What for to doon; and al this bet to eche, In honour, to as fer as she may strecche, A kinges herte semeth by hires a wrecche. 128 And for-thy loke of good comfort thou be; For certeinly, the firste poynt is this Of noble corage and wel ordeynè, A man to have pees with him-self, y-wis; So oughtest thou, for nought but good it is To loven wel, and in a worthy place; Thee oughte not to clepe it hap, but grace. 129 And also thenk, and ther-with glade thee, That sith thy lady vertuous is al, So folweth it that ther is som pitee Amonges alle thise othere in general; And for-thy see that thou, in special, Requere nought that is ayein hir name; For vertue streccheth not him-self to shame. 130 But wel is me that ever I was born, That thou biset art in so good a place; For by my trouthe, in love I dorste have sworn, Thee sholde never han tid thus fayr a grace; And wostow why? for thou were wont to chace At love in scorn, and for despyt him calle “Seynt Idiot, lord of thise foles alle.” 131 How often hastow maad thy nyce Iapes, And seyd, that loves servants everichone Of nycetee ben verray goddes apes; And some wolde monche hir mete alone, Ligging a-bedde, and make hem for to grone; And som, thou seydest, hadde a blaunche fevere, And preydest god he sholde never kevere! 132 And some of hem toke on hem, for the colde, More than y-nough, so seydestow ful ofte; And some han feyned ofte tyme, and tolde How that they wake, whan they slepen softe; And thus they wolde han brought hem-self a-lofte, And nathelees were under at the laste; Thus seydestow, and Iapedest ful faste. 133 Yet seydestow, that, for the more part, These loveres wolden speke in general, And thoughten that it was a siker art, For fayling, for to assayen over-al. Now may I iape of thee, if that I shal! But nathelees, though that I sholde deye, That thou art noon of tho, that dorste I seye. 134 Now beet thy brest, and sey to god of love, “Thy grace, lord! for now I me repente If I mis spak, for now my-self I love:” Thus sey with al thyn herte in good entente.’ Quod Troilus, ‘a! lord! I me consente, And pray to thee my Iapes thou foryive, And I shal never-more whyl I live.’ 135 ‘Thow seyst wel,’ quod Pandare, ‘and now I hope That thou the goddes wraththe hast al apesed; And sithen thou hast wepen many a drope, And seyd swich thing wher-with thy god is plesed, Now wolde never god but thou were esed; And think wel, she of whom rist al thy wo Here-after may thy comfort been al-so. 136 For thilke ground, that bereth the wedes wikke, Bereth eek thise holsom herbes, as ful ofte Next the foule netle, rough and thikke, The rose waxeth swote and smothe and softe; And next the valey is the hil a-lofte; And next the derke night the glade morwe; And also Ioye is next the fyn of sorwe. 137 Now loke that atempre be thy brydel, And, for the beste, ay suffre to the tyde, Or elles al our labour is on ydel; He hasteth wel that wysly can abyde; Be diligent, and trewe, and ay wel hyde. Be lusty, free, persevere in thy servyse, And al is wel, if thou werke in this wyse. 138 But he that parted is in every place Is no-wher hool, as writen clerkes wyse; What wonder is, though swich oon have no grace? Eek wostow how it fareth of som servyse? As plaunte a tre or herbe, in sondry wyse, And on the morwe pulle it up as blyve, No wonder is, though it may never thryve. 139 And sith that god of love hath thee bistowed In place digne un-to thy worthinesse, Stond faste, for to good port hastow rowed; And of thy-self, for any hevinesse, Hope alwey wel; for, but-if drerinesse Or over-haste our bothe labour shende, I hope of this to maken a good ende. 140 And wostow why I am the lasse a-fered Of this matere with my nece trete? For this have I herd seyd of wyse y-lered, “Was never man ne woman yet bigete That was unapt to suffren loves hete Celestial, or elles love of kinde;” For-thy som grace I hope in hir to finde. 141 And for to speke of hir in special, Hir beautee to bithinken and hir youthe, It sit hir nought to be celestial As yet, though that hir liste bothe and couthe; But trewely, it sete hir wel right nouthe A worthy knight to loven and cheryce, And but she do, I holde it for a vyce. 142 Wherfore I am, and wol be, ay redy To peyne me to do yow this servyse; For bothe yow to plese thus hope I Her-afterward; for ye beth bothe wyse, And conne it counseyl kepe in swich a wyse, That no man shal the wyser of it be; And so we may be gladed alle three. 143 And, by my trouthe, I have right now of thee A good conceyt in my wit, as I gesse, And what it is, I wol now that thou see. I thenke, sith that love, of his goodnesse, Hath thee converted out of wikkednesse, That thou shalt be the beste post, I leve, Of al his lay, and most his foos to-greve. 144 Ensample why, see now these wyse clerkes, That erren aldermost a-yein a lawe, And ben converted from hir wikked werkes Thorugh grace of god, that list hem to him drawe, Than arn they folk that han most god in awe, And strengest-feythed been, I understonde, And conne an errour alder-best withstonde.’ 145 Whan Troilus had herd Pandare assented To been his help in loving of Criseyde, Wex of his wo, as who seyth, untormented, But hotter wex his love, and thus he seyde, With sobre chere, al-though his herte pleyde, ‘Now blisful Venus helpe, er that I sterve, Of thee, Pandare, I may som thank deserve. 146 But, dere frend, how shal myn wo ben lesse Til this be doon? and goode, eek tel me this, How wiltow seyn of me and my destresse? Lest she be wrooth, this drede I most, y-wis, Or nil not here or trowen how it is. Al this drede I, and eek for the manere Of thee, hir eem, she nil no swich thing here.’ 147 Quod Pandarus, ‘thou hast a ful gret care Lest that the cherl may falle out of the mone! Why, lord! I hate of thee thy nyce fare! Why, entremete of that thou hast to done! For goddes love, I bidde thee a bone, So lat me alone, and it shal be thy beste.’— ‘Why, freend,’ quod he, ‘now do right as thee leste. 148 But herke, Pandare, o word, for I nolde That thou in me wendest so greet folye, That to my lady I desiren sholde That toucheth harm or any vilenye; For dredelees, me were lever dye Than she of me ought elles understode But that, that mighte sounen in-to gode.’ 149 Tho lough this Pandare, and anoon answerde, ‘And I thy borw? fy! no wight dooth but so; I roughte nought though that she stode and herde How that thou seyst; but fare-wel, I wol go. A-dieu! be glad! god spede us bothe two! Yif me this labour and this besinesse, And of my speed be thyn al that swetnesse.’ 150 Tho Troilus gan doun on knees to falle, And Pandare in his armes hente faste, And seyde, ‘now, fy on the Grekes alle! Yet, pardee, god shal helpe us at the laste; And dredelees, if that my lyf may laste, And god to-forn, lo, som of hem shal smerte; And yet me athinketh that this avaunt me asterte! 151 Now, Pandare, I can no more seye, But thou wys, thou wost, thou mayst, thou art al! My lyf, my deeth, hool in thyn honde I leye; Help now,’ quod he. ‘Yis, by my trouthe, I shal.’ ‘God yelde thee, freend, and this in special,’ Quod Troilus, ‘that thou me recomaunde To hir that to the deeth me may comaunde.’ 152 This Pandarus tho, desirous to serve His fulle freend, than seyde in this manere, ‘Far-wel, and thenk I wol thy thank deserve; Have here my trouthe, and that thou shalt wel here.’— And wente his wey, thenking on this matere, And how he best mighte hir beseche of grace, And finde a tyme ther-to, and a place. 153 For every wight that hath an hous to founde Ne renneth nought the werk for to biginne With rakel hond, but he wol byde a stounde, And sende his hertes lyne out fro with-inne Alderfirst his purpos for to winne. Al this Pandare in his herte thoughte, And caste his werk ful wysly, or he wroughte. 154 But Troilus lay tho no lenger doun, But up anoon up-on his stede bay, And in the feld he pleyde tho leoun; Wo was that Greek that with him mette that day. And in the toun his maner tho forth ay So goodly was, and gat him so in grace, That ech him lovede that loked on his face. 155 For he bicom the frendlyeste wight, The gentileste, and eek the moste free, The thriftieste and oon the beste knight, That in his tyme was, or mighte be. Dede were his Iapes and his crueltee, His heighe port and his manere estraunge, And ech of tho gan for a vertu chaunge. 156 Now lat us stinte of Troilus a stounde, That fareth lyk a man that hurt is sore, And is somdel of akinge of his wounde Y-lissed wel, but heled no del more: And, as an esy pacient, the lore Abit of him that gooth aboute his cure; And thus he dryveth forth his aventure.

For-why to every lovere I me excuse, That of no sentement I this endyte, But out of Latin in my tonge it wryte. 3 Wherfore I nil have neither thank ne blame Of al this werk, but pray yow mekely, Disblameth me, if any word be lame, For as myn auctor seyde, so seye I. Eek though I speke of love unfelingly, No wonder is, for it no-thing of newe is; A blind man can nat Iuggen wel in hewis. 4 Ye knowe eek, that in forme of speche is chaunge With-inne a thousand yeer, and wordes tho That hadden prys, now wonder nyce and straunge Us thinketh hem; and yet they spake hem so, And spedde as wel in love as men now do; Eek for to winne love in sondry ages, In sondry londes, sondry ben usages. 5 And for-thy if it happe in any wyse, That here be any lovere in this place That herkeneth, as the story wol devyse, How Troilus com to his lady grace, And thenketh, so nolde I nat love purchace, Or wondreth on his speche and his doinge, I noot; but it is me no wonderinge; 6 For every wight which that to Rome went, Halt nat o path, or alwey o manere; Eek in some lond were al the gamen shent, If that they ferde in love as men don here, As thus, in open doing or in chere, In visitinge, in forme, or seyde hir sawes; For-thy men seyn, ech contree hath his lawes. 7 Eek scarsly been ther in this place three That han in love seyd lyk and doon in al; For to thy purpos this may lyken thee, And thee right nought, yet al is seyd or shal; Eek som men grave in tree, som in stoon wal, As it bitit; but sin I have begonne, Myn auctor shal I folwen, if I conne.

Is it of love? O, som good ye me lere!’ ‘Uncle,’ quod she, ‘your maistresse is not here!’ 15 With that they gonnen laughe, and tho she seyde, ‘This romaunce is of Thebes, that we rede; And we han herd how that king Laius deyde Thurgh Edippus his sone, and al that dede; And here we stenten at these lettres rede, How the bisshop, as the book can telle, Amphiorax, fil thurgh the ground to helle.’ 16 Quod Pandarus, ‘al this knowe I my-selve, And al the assege of Thebes and the care; For her-of been ther maked bokes twelve:— But lat be this, and tel me how ye fare; Do wey your barbe, and shew your face bare; Do wey your book, rys up, and lat us daunce, And lat us don to May som observaunce.’ 17 ‘A! god forbede!’ quod she, ‘be ye mad?’ Is that a widewes lyf, so god you save? By god, ye maken me right sore a-drad, Ye ben so wilde, it semeth as ye rave! It sete me wel bet ay in a cave To bidde, and rede on holy seyntes lyves: Lat maydens gon to daunce, and yonge wyves.’ 18 ‘As ever thryve I,’ quod this Pandarus, ‘Yet coude I telle a thing to doon you pleye.’ ‘Now uncle dere,’ quod she, ‘tel it us For goddes love; is than the assege aweye? I am of Grekes so ferd that I deye.’ ‘Nay, nay,’ quod he, ‘as ever mote I thryve! It is a thing wel bet than swiche fyve.’ 19 ‘Ye, holy god!’ quod she, ‘what thing is that? What? bet than swiche fyve? ey, nay, y-wis! For al this world ne can I reden what It sholde been; som Iape, I trowe, is this; And but your-selven telle us what it is, My wit is for to arede it al to lene; As help me god, I noot nat what ye mene.’ 20 ‘And I your borow, ne never shal, for me, This thing be told to yow, as mote I thryve!’ ‘And why so, uncle myn? why so?’ quod she. ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘that wole I telle as blyve; For prouder womman were ther noon on-lyve, And ye it wiste, in al the toun of Troye; I iape nought, as ever have I Ioye!’ 21 Tho gan she wondren more than biforn A thousand fold, and doun hir eyen caste; For never, sith the tyme that she was born, To knowe thing desired she so faste; And with a syk she seyde him at the laste, ‘Now, uncle myn, I nil yow nought displese, Nor axen more, that may do yow disese.’ 22 So after this, with many wordes glade, And freendly tales, and with mery chere, Of this and that they pleyde, and gunnen wade In many an unkouth glad and deep matere, As freendes doon, whan they ben met y-fere; Til she gan axen him how Ector ferde, That was the tounes wal and Grekes yerde. 23 ‘Ful wel, I thanke it god,’ quod Pandarus, ‘Save in his arm he hath a litel wounde; And eek his fresshe brother Troilus, The wyse worthy Ector the secounde, In whom that every vertu list abounde, As alle trouthe and alle gentillesse, Wysdom, honour, fredom, and worthinesse.’ 24 ‘In good feith, eem,’ quod she, ‘that lyketh me; They faren wel, god save hem bothe two! For trewely I holde it greet deyntee A kinges sone in armes wel to do, And been of good condiciouns ther-to; For greet power and moral vertu here Is selde y-seye in o persone y-fere.’ 25 ‘In good feith, that is sooth,’ quod Pandarus; But, by my trouthe, the king hath sones tweye, That is to mene, Ector and Troilus, That certainly, though that I sholde deye, They been as voyde of vyces, dar I seye, As any men that liveth under the sonne, Hir might is wyde y-knowe, and what they conne. 26 Of Ector nedeth it nought for to telle; In al this world ther nis a bettre knight Than he, that is of worthinesse welle; And he wel more vertu hath than might. This knoweth many a wys and worthy wight. The same prys of Troilus I seye, God help me so, I knowe not swiche tweye.’ 27 ‘By god,’ quod she, ‘of Ector that is sooth; Of Troilus the same thing trowe I; For dredelees, men tellen that he dooth In armes day by day so worthily, And bereth him here at hoom so gentilly To every wight, that al the prys hath he Of hem that me were levest preysed be.’ 28 ‘Ye sey right sooth, y-wis,’ quod Pandarus; ‘For yesterday, who-so hadde with him been, He might have wondred up-on Troilus; For never yet so thikke a swarm of been Ne fleigh, as Grekes fro him gonne fleen; And thorugh the feld, in every wightes ere, Ther nas no cry but “Troilus is there!” 29 Now here, now there, he hunted hem so faste, Ther nas but Grekes blood; and Troilus, Now hem he hurte, and hem alle doun he caste; Ay where he wente it was arayed thus: He was hir deeth, and sheld and lyf for us; That as that day ther dorste noon with-stonde, Whyl that he held his blody swerd in honde. 30 Therto he is the freendlieste man Of grete estat, that ever I saw my lyve; And wher him list, best felawshipe can To suche as him thinketh able for to thryve.’ And with that word tho Pandarus, as blyve, He took his leve, and seyde, ‘I wol go henne:’ ‘Nay, blame have I, myn uncle,’ quod she thenne. 31 ‘What eyleth yow to be thus wery sone, And namelich of wommen? wol ye so? Nay, sitteth down; by god, I have to done With yow, to speke of wisdom er ye go.’ And every wight that was a-boute hem tho, That herde that, gan fer a-wey to stonde, Whyl they two hadde al that hem liste in honde. 32 Whan that hir tale al brought was to an ende Of hire estat and of hir governaunce, Quod Pandarus, ‘now is it tyme I wende; But yet, I seye, aryseth, lat us daunce, And cast your widwes habit to mischaunce: What list yow thus your-self to disfigure, Sith yow is tid thus fair an aventure?’ 33 ‘A! wel bithought! for love of god,’ quod she, ‘Shal I not witen what ye mene of this?’ ‘No, this thing axeth layser,’ tho quod he, ‘And eek me wolde muche greve, y-wis, If I it tolde, and ye it toke amis. Yet were it bet my tonge for to stille Than seye a sooth that were ayeins your wille. 34 For, nece, by the goddesse Minerve, And Iuppiter, that maketh the thonder ringe, And by the blisful Venus that I serve, Ye been the womman in this world livinge, With-oute paramours, to my witinge, That I best love, and lothest am to greve, And that ye witen wel your-self, I leve.’ 35 ‘Y-wis, myn uncle,’ quod she, ‘grant mercy; Your freendship have I founden ever yit; I am to no man holden trewely So muche as yow, and have so litel quit; And, with the grace of god, emforth my wit, As in my gilt I shal you never offende; And if I have er this, I wol amende. 36 But, for the love of god, I yow beseche, As ye ben he that I most love and triste, Lat be to me your fremde maner speche, And sey to me, your nece, what yow liste:’ And with that word hir uncle anoon hir kiste, And seyde, ‘gladly, leve nece dere, Tak it for good that I shal seye yow here.’ 37 With that she gan hir eyen doun to caste, And Pandarus to coghe gan a lyte, And seyde, ‘nece, alwey, lo! to the laste, How-so it be that som men hem delyte With subtil art hir tales for to endyte, Yet for al that, in hir entencioun, Hir tale is al for som conclusioun. 38 And sithen thende is every tales strengthe, And this matere is so bihovely, What sholde I peynte or drawen it on lengthe To yow, that been my freend so feithfully?’ And with that word he gan right inwardly Biholden hir, and loken on hir face, And seyde, ‘on suche a mirour goode grace!’ 39 Than thoughte he thus, ‘if I my tale endyte Ought hard, or make a proces any whyle, She shal no savour han ther-in but lyte, And trowe I wolde hir in my wil bigyle. For tendre wittes wenen al be wyle Ther-as they can nat pleynly understonde; For-thy hir wit to serven wol I fonde’— 40 And loked on hir in a besy wyse, And she was war that he byheld hir so, And seyde, ‘lord! so faste ye me avyse! Sey ye me never er now? what sey ye, no?’ ‘Yes, yes,’ quod he, ‘and bet wole er I go; But, by my trouthe, I thoughte now if ye Be fortunat, for now men shal it see. 41 For to every wight som goodly aventure Som tyme is shape, if he it can receyven; And if that he wol take of it no cure, Whan that it cometh, but wilfully it weyven, Lo, neither cas nor fortune him deceyven, But right his verray slouthe and wrecchednesse; And swich a wight is for to blame, I gesse. 42 Good aventure, O bele nece, have ye Ful lightly founden, and ye conne it take; And, for the love of god, and eek of me, Cacche it anoon, lest aventure slake. What sholde I lenger proces of it make? Yif me your hond, for in this world is noon, If that you list, a wight so wel begoon. 43 And sith I speke of good entencioun, As I to yow have told wel here-biforn, And love as wel your honour and renoun As creature in al this world y-born; By alle the othes that I have yow sworn, And ye be wrooth therfore, or wene I lye, Ne shal I never seen yow eft with yë. 44 Beth nought agast, ne quaketh nat; wher-to? Ne chaungeth nat for fere so your hewe; For hardely, the werste of this is do; And though my tale as now be to yow newe, Yet trist alwey, ye shal me finde trewe; And were it thing that me thoughte unsittinge, To yow nolde I no swiche tales bringe.’ 45 ‘Now, my good eem, for goddes love, I preye,’ Quod she, ‘com of, and tel me what it is; For bothe I am agast what ye wol seye, And eek me longeth it to wite, y-wis. For whether it be wel or be amis, Sey on, lat me not in this fere dwelle:’ ‘So wol I doon, now herkneth, I shal telle: 46 Now, nece myn, the kinges dere sone, The goode, wyse, worthy, fresshe, and free, Which alwey for to do wel is his wone, The noble Troilus, so loveth thee, That, bot ye helpe, it wol his bane be. Lo, here is al, what sholde I more seye? Doth what yow list, to make him live or deye. 47 But if ye lete him deye, I wol sterve; Have her my trouthe, nece, I nil not lyen; Al sholde I with this knyf my throte kerve’— With that the teres braste out of his yën, And seyde, ‘if that ye doon us bothe dyen, Thus giltelees, than have ye fisshed faire; What mende ye, though that we bothe apeyre? 48 Allas! he which that is my lord so dere, That trewe man, that noble gentil knight, That nought desireth but your freendly chere, I see him deye, ther he goth up-right, And hasteth him, with al his fulle might, For to be slayn, if fortune wol assente; Allas! that god yow swich a beautee sente! 49 If it be so that ye so cruel be, That of his deeth yow liste nought to recche, That is so trewe and worthy, as ye see, No more than of a Iapere or a wrecche, If ye be swich, your beautee may not strecche To make amendes of so cruel a dede; Avysement is good bifore the nede. 50 Wo worth the faire gemme vertulees! Wo worth that herbe also that dooth no bote! Wo worth that beautee that is routhelees! Wo worth that wight that tret ech under fote! And ye, that been of beautee crop and rote, If therwith-al in you ther be no routhe, Than is it harm ye liven, by my trouthe! 51 And also thenk wel, that this is no gaude; For me were lever, thou and I and he Were hanged, than I sholde been his baude, As heyghe, as men mighte on us alle y-see: I am thyn eem, the shame were to me, As wel as thee, if that I sholde assente, Thorugh myn abet, that he thyn honour shente. 52 Now understond, for I yow nought requere, To binde yow to him thorugh no beheste, But only that ye make him bettre chere Than ye han doon er this, and more feste, So that his lyf be saved, at the leste: This al and som, and playnly our entente; God helpe me so, I never other mente. 53 Lo, this request is not but skile, y-wis, Ne doute of reson, pardee, is ther noon. I sette the worste that ye dredden this, Men wolden wondren seen him come or goon: Ther-ayeins answere I thus a-noon, That every wight, but he be fool of kinde, Wol deme it love of freendship in his minde. 54 What? who wol deme, though he see a man To temple go, that he the images eteth? Thenk eek how wel and wysly that he can Governe him-self, that he no-thing foryeteth, That, wher he cometh, he prys and thank him geteth; And eek ther-to, he shal come here so selde, What fors were it though al the toun behelde? 55 Swich love of freendes regneth al this toun; And wrye yow in that mantel ever-mo; And, god so wis be my savacioun, As I have seyd, your beste is to do so. But alwey, goode nece, to stinte his wo, So lat your daunger sucred ben a lyte, That of his deeth ye be nought for to wyte.’ 56 Criseyde, which that herde him in this wyse, Thoughte, ‘I shal fele what he meneth, y-wis.’ ‘Now, eem,’ quod she, ‘what wolde ye devyse, What is your reed I sholde doon of this?’ ‘That is wel seyd,’ quod he, ‘certayn, best is That ye him love ayein for his lovinge, As love for love is skilful guerdoninge. 57 Thenk eek, how elde wasteth every houre In eche of yow a party of beautee; And therfore, er that age thee devoure, Go love, for, olde, ther wol no wight of thee. Lat this proverbe a lore un-to yow be; “To late y-war, quod Beautee, whan it paste;” And elde daunteth daunger at the laste. 58 The kinges fool is woned to cryen loude, Whan that him thinketh a womman bereth hir hyë, “So longe mote ye live, and alle proude, Til crowes feet be growe under your yë, And sende yow thanne a mirour in to pryë In whiche ye may see your face a-morwe!” Nece, I bidde wisshe yow no more sorwe.’ 59 With this he stente, and caste adoun the heed, And she bigan to breste a-wepe anoon. And seyde, ‘allas, for wo! why nere I deed? For of this world the feith is al agoon! Allas! what sholden straunge to me doon, When he, that for my beste freend I wende, Ret me to love, and sholde it me defende? 60 Allas! I wolde han trusted, doutelees, That if that I, thurgh my disaventure, Had loved other him or Achilles, Ector, or any mannes creature, Ye nolde han had no mercy ne mesure On me, but alwey had me in repreve; This false world, allas! who may it leve? 61 What? is this al the Ioye and al the feste? Is this your reed, is this my blisful cas? Is this the verray mede of your beheste? Is al this peynted proces seyd, allas! Right for this fyn? O lady myn, Pallas! Thou in this dredful cas for me purveye; For so astonied am I that I deye!’ 62 With that she gan ful sorwfully to syke; ‘A! may it be no bet?’ quod Pandarus; ‘By god, I shal no-more com here this wyke, And god to-forn, that am mistrusted thus; I see ful wel that ye sette lyte of us, Or of our deeth! Allas! I woful wrecche! Mighte he yet live, of me is nought to recche. 63 O cruel god, O dispitouse Marte, O Furies three of helle, on yow I crye! So lat me never out of this hous departe, If that I mente harm or vilanye! But sith I see my lord mot nedes dye, And I with him, here I me shryve, and seye That wikkedly ye doon us bothe deye. 64 But sith it lyketh yow that I be deed, By Neptunus, that god is of the see, Fro this forth shal I never eten breed Til I myn owene herte blood may see; For certayn, I wole deye as sone as he’— And up he sterte, and on his wey he raughte, Til she agayn him by the lappe caughte. 65 Criseyde, which that wel neigh starf for fere, So as she was the ferfulleste wight That mighte be, and herde eek with hir ere, And saw the sorwful ernest of the knight, And in his preyere eek saw noon unright, And for the harm that mighte eek fallen more, She gan to rewe, and dradde hir wonder sore; 66 And thoughte thus, ‘unhappes fallen thikke Alday for love, and in swich maner cas, As men ben cruel in hem-self and wikke; And if this man slee here him-self, allas! In my presence, it wol be no solas. What men wolde of hit deme I can nat seye; It nedeth me ful sleyly for to pleye.’ 67 And with a sorwful syk she seyde thrye, ‘A! lord! what me is tid a sory chaunce! For myn estat now lyth in Iupartye, And eek myn emes lyf lyth in balaunce; But nathelees, with goddes governaunce, I shal so doon, myn honour shal I kepe, And eek his lyf;’ and stinte for to wepe. 68 ‘Of harmes two, the lesse is for to chese; Yet have I lever maken him good chere In honour, than myn emes lyf to lese; Ye seyn, ye no-thing elles me requere?’ ‘No, wis,’ quod he, ‘myn owene nece dere.’ ‘Now wel,’ quod she, ‘and I wol doon my peyne; I shal myn herte ayeins my lust constreyne, 69 But that I nil not holden him in honde, Ne love a man, ne can I not, ne may Ayeins my wil; but elles wol I fonde, Myn honour sauf, plese him fro day to day; Ther-to nolde I nought ones have seyd nay, But that I dredde, as in my fantasye; But cesse cause, ay cesseth maladye. 70 And here I make a protestacioun, That in this proces if ye depper go, That certaynly, for no savacioun Of yow, though that ye sterve bothe two, Though al the world on o day be my fo, Ne shal I never on him han other routhe.’— ‘I graunte wel,’ quod Pandare, ‘by my trouthe. 71 But may I truste wel ther-to,’ quod he, That, of this thing that ye han hight me here, Ye wol it holden trewly un-to me?’ ‘Ye, doutelees,’ quod she, ‘myn uncle dere.’ ‘Ne that I shal han cause in this matere,’ Quod he, ‘to pleyne, or after yow to preche?’ ‘Why, no, pardee; what nedeth more speche?’ 72 Tho fillen they in othere tales glade, Til at the laste, ‘O good eem,’ quod she tho, ‘For love of god, which that us bothe made, Tel me how first ye wisten of his wo: Wot noon of hit but ye?’ He seyde, ‘no.’ ‘Can he wel speke of love?’ quod she, ‘I preye, Tel me, for I the bet me shal purveye.’ 73 Tho Pandarus a litel gan to smyle, And seyde, ‘by my trouthe, I shal yow telle. This other day, nought gon ful longe whyle, In-with the paleys-gardyn, by a welle, Gan he and I wel half a day to dwelle, Right for to speken of an ordenaunce, How we the Grekes mighte disavaunce. 74 Sone after that bigonne we to lepe, And casten with our dartes to and fro, Til at the laste he seyde, he wolde slepe, And on the gres a-doun he leyde him tho; And I after gan rome to and fro Til that I herde, as that I welk allone, How he bigan ful wofully to grone. 75 Tho gan I stalke him softely bihinde, And sikerly, the sothe for to seyne, As I can clepe ayein now to my minde, Right thus to Love he gan him for to pleyne; He seyde, “lord! have routhe up-on my peyne, Al have I been rebel in myn entente; Now, mea culpa, lord! I me repente. 76 O god, that at thy disposicioun Ledest the fyn, by Iuste purveyaunce, Of every wight, my lowe confessioun Accepte in gree, and send me swich penaunc As lyketh thee, but from desesperaunce, That may my goost departe awey fro thee, Thou be my sheld, for thy benignitee. 77 For certes, lord, so sore hath she me wounded That stod in blak, with loking of hir yën, That to myn hertes botme it is y-sounded, Thorugh which I woot that I mot nedes dyen; This is the worste, I dar me not bi-wryen; And wel the hotter been the gledes rede, That men hem wryen with asshen pale and dede.” 78 With that he smoot his heed adoun anoon, And gan to motre, I noot what, trewely. And I with that gan stille awey to goon, And leet ther-of as no-thing wist hadde I, And come ayein anoon and stood him by, And seyde, “a-wake, ye slepen al to longe; It semeth nat that love dooth yow longe, 79 That slepen so that no man may yow wake. Who sey ever or this so dul a man?” “Ye, freend,” quod he, “do ye your hedes ake For love, and lat me liven as I can.” But though that he for wo was pale and wan, Yet made he tho as fresh a contenaunce, As though he shulde have led the newe daunce. 80 This passed forth, til now, this other day, It fel that I com roming al allone Into his chaumbre, and fond how that he lay Up-on his bed; but man so sore grone Ne herde I never, and what that was his mone, Ne wiste I nought; for, as I was cominge, Al sodeynly he lefte his compleyninge. 81 Of which I took somwhat suspecioun, And neer I com, and fond he wepte sore; And god so wis be my savacioun, As never of thing hadde I no routhe more. For neither with engyn, ne with no lore, Unethes mighte I fro the deeth him kepe; That yet fele I myn herte for him wepe. 82 And god wot, never, sith that I was born, Was I so bisy no man for to preche, Ne never was to wight so depe y-sworn, Or he me tolde who mighte been his leche. But now to yow rehersen al his speche, Or alle his woful wordes for to soune, Ne bid me not, but ye wol see me swowne. 83 But for to save his lyf, and elles nought, And to non harm of yow, thus am I driven; And for the love of god that us hath wrought, Swich chere him dooth, that he and I may liven. Now have I plat to yow myn herte schriven; And sin ye woot that myn entente is clene, Tak hede ther-of, for I non yvel mene. 84 And right good thrift, I pray to god, have ye, That han swich oon y-caught with-oute net; And be ye wys, as ye ben fair to see, Wel in the ring than is the ruby set. Ther were never two so wel y-met, Whan ye ben his al hool, as he is youre: Ther mighty god yet graunte us see that houre!’ 85 ‘Nay, therof spak I not, a, ha!’ quod she, ‘As helpe me god, ye shenden every deel!’ ‘O mercy, dere nece,’ anoon quod he, ‘What-so I spak, I mente nought but weel, By Mars the god, that helmed is of steel; Now beth nought wrooth, my blood, my nece dere.’ ‘Now wel,’ quod she, ‘foryeven be it here!’ 86 With this he took his leve, and hoom he wente; And lord, how he was glad and wel bigoon! Criseyde aroos, no lenger she ne stente, But straught in-to hir closet wente anoon, And sette here doun as stille as any stoon, And every word gan up and doun to winde, That he hadde seyd, as it com hir to minde; 87 And wex somdel astonied in hir thought, Right for the newe cas; but whan that she Was ful avysed, tho fond she right nought Of peril, why she oughte afered be. For man may love, of possibilitee, A womman so, his herte may to-breste, And she nought love ayein, but-if hir leste. 88 But as she sat allone and thoughte thus, Thascry aroos at skarmish al with-oute, And men cryde in the strete, ‘see, Troilus Hath right now put to flight the Grekes route!’ With that gan al hir meynee for to shoute, ‘A! go we see, caste up the latis wyde; For thurgh this strete he moot to palays ryde; 89 For other wey is fro the yate noon Of Dardanus, ther open is the cheyne.’ With that com he and al his folk anoon An esy pas rydinge, in routes tweyne, Right as his happy day was, sooth to seyne, For which, men say, may nought disturbed be That shal bityden of necessitee. 90 This Troilus sat on his baye stede, Al armed, save his heed, ful richely, And wounded was his hors, and gan to blede, On whiche he rood a pas, ful softely; But swych a knightly sighte, trewely, As was on him, was nought, with-outen faile, To loke on Mars, that god is of batayle. 91 So lyk a man of armes and a knight He was to seen, fulfild of heigh prowesse; For bothe he hadde a body and a might To doon that thing, as wel as hardinesse; And eek to seen him in his gere him dresse, So fresh, so yong, so weldy semed he, It was an heven up-on him for to see. 92 His helm to-hewen was in twenty places, That by a tissew heng, his bak bihinde, His sheld to-dasshed was with swerdes and maces, In which men mighte many an arwe finde That thirled hadde horn and nerf and rinde; And ay the peple cryde, ‘here cometh our Ioye, And, next his brother, holdere up of Troye!’ 93 For which he wex a litel reed for shame, Whan he the peple up-on him herde cryen, That to biholde it was a noble game, How sobreliche he caste doun his yën. Cryseyda gan al his chere aspyen, And leet so softe it in hir herte sinke, That to hir-self she seyde, ‘who yaf me drinke?’ 94 For of hir owene thought she wex al reed, Remembringe hir right thus, ‘lo, this is he Which that myn uncle swereth he moot be deed, But I on him have mercy and pitee;’ And with that thought, for pure a-shamed, she Gan in hir heed to pulle, and that as faste, Whyl he and al the peple for-by paste, 95 And gan to caste and rollen up and doun With-inne hir thought his excellent prowesse, And his estat, and also his renoun, His wit, his shap, and eek his gentillesse; But most hir favour was, for his distresse Was al for hir, and thoughte it was a routhe To sleen swich oon, if that he mente trouthe. 96 Now mighte som envyous Iangle thus, ‘This was a sodeyn love, how mighte it be That she so lightly lovede Troilus Right for the firste sighte; ye, pardee?’ Now who-so seyth so, mote he never thee! For every thing, a ginning hath in nede Er al be wrought, with-outen any drede. 97 For I sey nought that she so sodeynly Yaf him hir love, but that she gan enclyne To lyke him first, and I have told yow why; And after that, his manhod and his pyne Made love with-inne hir for to myne, For which, by proces and by good servyse, He gat hir love, and in no sodeyn wyse. 98 And also blisful Venus, wel arayed, Sat in hir seventhe hous of hevene tho, Disposed wel, and with aspectes payed, To helpen sely Troilus of his wo. And, sooth to seyn, she nas nat al a fo To Troilus in his nativitee; God woot that wel the soner spedde he. 99 Now lat us stinte of Troilus a throwe, That rydeth forth, and lat us tourne faste Un-to Criseyde, that heng hir heed ful lowe, Ther-as she sat allone, and gan to caste Wher-on she wolde apoynte hir at the laste, If it so were hir eem ne wolde cesse, For Troilus, up-on hir for to presse. 100 And, lord! so she gan in hir thought argue In this matere of which I have yow told, And what to doon best were, and what eschue, That plyted she ful ofte in many fold. Now was hir herte warm, now was it cold, And what she thoughte somwhat shal I wryte, As to myn auctor listeth for to endyte. 101 She thoughte wel, that Troilus persone She knew by sighte and eek his gentillesse, And thus she seyde, ‘al were it nought to done, To graunte him love, yet, for his worthinesse, It were honour, with pley and with gladnesse, In honestee, with swich a lord to dele, For myn estat, and also for his hele. 102 Eek, wel wot I my kinges sone is he; And sith he hath to see me swich delyt, If I wolde utterly his sighte flee, Paraunter he mighte have me in dispyt, Thurgh which I mighte stonde in worse plyt; Now were I wys, me hate to purchace, With-outen nede, ther I may stonde in grace? 103 In every thing, I woot, ther lyth mesure. For though a man forbede dronkenesse, He nought for-bet that every creature Be drinkelees for alwey, as I gesse; Eek sith I woot for me is his distresse, I ne oughte not for that thing him despyse, Sith it is so, he meneth in good wyse. 104 And eek I knowe, of longe tyme agoon, His thewes goode, and that he is not nyce. Ne avauntour, seyth men, certein, is he noon; To wys is he to do so gret a vyce; Ne als I nel him never so cheryce, That he may make avaunt, by Iuste cause; He shal me never binde in swiche a clause. 105 Now set a cas, the hardest is, y-wis, Men mighten deme that he loveth me: What dishonour were it un-to me, this? May I him lette of that? why nay, pardee! I knowe also, and alday here and see, Men loven wommen al this toun aboute; Be they the wers? why, nay, with-outen doute. 106 I thenk eek how he able is for to have Of al this noble toun the thriftieste, To been his love, so she hir honour save; For out and out he is the worthieste, Save only Ector, which that is the beste. And yet his lyf al lyth now in my cure, But swich is love, and eek myn aventure. 107 Ne me to love, a wonder is it nought; For wel wot I my-self, so god me spede, Al wolde I that noon wistë of this thought, I am oon the fayreste, out of drede, And goodlieste, who-so taketh hede; And so men seyn in al the toun of Troye. What wonder is it though he of me have Ioye? 108 I am myn owene woman, wel at ese, I thank it god, as after myn estat; Right yong, and stonde unteyd in lusty lese, With-outen Ialousye or swich debat; Shal noon housbonde seyn to me “chekmat!” For either they ben ful of Ialousye, Or maisterful, or loven novelrye. 109 What shal I doon? to what fyn live I thus? Shal I nat loven, in cas if that me leste? What, par dieux! I am nought religious! And though that I myn herte sette at reste Upon this knight, that is the worthieste, And kepe alwey myn honour and my name, By alle right, it may do me no shame.’ 110 But right as whan the sonne shyneth brighte, In March, that chaungeth ofte tyme his face, And that a cloud is put with wind to flighte Which over-sprat the sonne as for a space, A cloudy thought gan thorugh hir soule pace, That over-spradde hir brighte thoughtes alle, So that for fere almost she gan to falle. 111 That thought was this, ‘allas! sin I am free, Sholde I now love, and putte in Iupartye My sikernesse, and thrallen libertee? Allas! how dorste I thenken that folye? May I nought wel in other folk aspye Hir dredful Ioye, hir constreynt, and hir peyne? Ther loveth noon, that she nath why to pleyne. 112 For love is yet the moste stormy lyf, Right of him-self, that ever was bigonne; For ever som mistrust, or nyce stryf, Ther is in love, som cloud is over the sonne: Ther-to we wrecched wommen no-thing conne, Whan us is wo, but wepe and sitte and thinke; Our wreche is this, our owene wo to drinke. 113 Also these wikked tonges been so prest To speke us harm, eek men be so untrewe, That, right anoon as cessed is hir lest, So cesseth love, and forth to love a newe: But harm y-doon, is doon, who-so it rewe. For though these men for love hem first to-rende, Ful sharp biginning breketh ofte at ende. 114 How ofte tyme hath it y-knowen be, The treson, that to womman hath be do? To what fyn is swich love, I can nat see, Or wher bicomth it, whan it is ago; Ther is no wight that woot, I trowe so, Wher it bycomth; lo, no wight on it sporneth; That erst was no-thing, in-to nought it torneth. 115 How bisy, if I love, eek moste I be To plesen hem that Iangle of love, and demen, And coye hem, that they sey non harm of me? For though ther be no cause, yet hem semen Al be for harm that folk hir freendes quemen; And who may stoppen every wikked tonge, Or soun of belles whyl that they be ronge?’ 116 And after that, hir thought bigan to clere, And seyde, ‘he which that no-thing under-taketh, No-thing ne acheveth, be him looth or dere.’ And with an other thought hir herte quaketh; Than slepeth hope, and after dreed awaketh; Now hoot, now cold; but thus, bi-twixen tweye, She rist hir up, and went hir for to pleye. 117 Adoun the steyre anoon-right tho she wente In-to the gardin, with hir neces three, And up and doun ther made many a wente, Flexippe, she, Tharbe, and Antigone, To pleyen, that it Ioye was to see; And othere of hir wommen, a gret route, Hir folwede in the gardin al aboute. 118 This yerd was large, and rayled alle the aleyes, And shadwed wel with blosmy bowes grene, And benched newe, and sonded alle the weyes, In which she walketh arm in arm bi-twene; Til at the laste Antigone the shene Gan on a Troian song to singe clere, That it an heven was hir voys to here.— 119 She seyde, ‘O love, to whom I have and shal Ben humble subgit, trewe in myn entente, As I best can, to yow, lord, yeve ich al For ever-more, myn hertes lust to rente. For never yet thy grace no wight sente So blisful cause as me, my lyf to lede In alle Ioye and seurtee, out of drede. 120 Ye, blisful god, han me so wel beset In love, y-wis, that al that bereth lyf Imaginen ne cowde how to ben bet; For, lord, with-outen Ialousye or stryf, I love oon which that is most ententyf To serven wel, unwery or unfeyned, That ever was, and leest with harm distreyned. 121 As he that is the welle of worthinesse, Of trouthe ground, mirour of goodliheed, Of wit Appollo, stoon of sikernesse, Of vertu rote, of lust findere and heed, Thurgh which is alle sorwe fro me deed, Y-wis, I love him best, so doth he me; Now good thrift have he, wher-so that he be! 122 Whom sholde I thanke but yow, god of love, Of al this blisse, in which to bathe I ginne? And thanked be ye, lord, for that I love! This is the righte lyf that I am inne, To flemen alle manere vyce and sinne: This doth me so to vertu for to entende, That day by day I in my wil amende. 123 And who-so seyth that for to love is vyce, Or thraldom, though he fele in it distressse, He outher is envyous, or right nyce, Or is unmighty, for his shrewednesse, To loven; for swich maner folk, I gesse, Defamen love, as no-thing of him knowe; They speken, but they bente never his bowe. 124 What is the sonne wers, of kinde righte, Though that a man, for feblesse of his yën, May nought endure on it to see for brighte? Or love the wers, though wrecches on it cryen? No wele is worth, that may no sorwe dryen. And for-thy, who that hath an heed of verre, Fro cast of stones war him in the werre! 125 But I with al myn herte and al my might, As I have seyd, wol love, un-to my laste, My dere herte, and al myn owene knight, In which myn herte growen is so faste, And his in me, that it shal ever laste. Al dredde I first to love him to biginne, Now woot I wel, ther is no peril inne.’ 126 And of hir song right with that word she stente, And therwith-al, ‘now, nece,’ quod Criseyde, ‘Who made this song with so good entente?’ Antigone answerde anoon, and seyde, ‘Ma dame, y-wis, the goodlieste mayde Of greet estat in al the toun of Troye; And let hir lyf in most honour and Ioye.’ 127 ‘Forsothe, so it semeth by hir song,’ Quod tho Criseyde, and gan ther-with to syke, And seyde, ‘lord, is there swich blisse among These lovers, as they conne faire endyte?’ ‘Ye, wis,’ quod fresh Antigone the whyte, ‘For alle the folk that han or been on lyve Ne conne wel the blisse of love discryve. 128 But wene ye that every wrecche woot The parfit blisse of love? why, nay, y-wis; They wenen al be love, if oon be hoot; Do wey, do wey, they woot no-thing of this! Men mosten axe at seyntes if it is Aught fair in hevene; why? for they conne telle; And axen fendes, is it foul in helle.’ 129 Criseyde un-to that purpos nought answerde, But seyde, ‘y-wis, it wol be night as faste.’ But every word which that she of hir herde, She gan to prenten in hir herte faste; And ay gan love hir lasse for to agaste Than it dide erst, and sinken in hir herte, That she wex somwhat able to converte. 130 The dayes honour, and the hevenes yë, The nightes fo, al this clepe I the sonne, Gan westren faste, and dounward for to wrye, As he that hadde his dayes cours y-ronne; And whyte thinges wexen dimme and donne For lak of light, and sterres for to appere, That she and al hir folk in wente y-fere. 131 So whan it lyked hir to goon to reste, And voyded weren they that voyden oughte, She seyde, that to slepe wel hir leste. Hir wommen sone til hir bed hir broughte. Whan al was hust, than lay she stille, and thoughte Of al this thing the manere and the wyse. Reherce it nedeth nought, for ye ben wyse. 132 A nightingale, upon a cedre grene, Under the chambre-wal ther as she lay, Ful loude sang ayein the mone shene, Paraunter, in his briddes wyse, a lay Of love, that made hir herte fresh and gay. That herkned she so longe in good entente, Til at the laste the dede sleep hir hente. 133 And, as she sleep, anoon-right tho hir mette, How that an egle, fethered whyt as boon, Under hir brest his longe clawes sette, And out hir herte he rente, and that a-noon, And dide his herte in-to hir brest to goon, Of which she nought agroos ne no-thing smerte, And forth he fleigh, with herte left for herte. 134 Now lat hir slepe, and we our tales holde Of Troilus, that is to paleys riden, Fro the scarmuch, of the whiche I tolde, And in his chambre sit, and hath abiden Til two or three of his messages yeden For Pandarus, and soughten him ful faste, Til they him founde, and broughte him at the laste. 135 This Pandarus com leping in at ones And seide thus, ‘who hath ben wel y-bete To-day with swerdes, and with slinge-stones, But Troilus, that hath caught him an hete?’ And gan to Iape, and seyde, ‘lord, so ye swete! But rys, and lat us soupe and go to reste;’ And he answerde him, ‘do we as thee leste.’ 136 With al the haste goodly that they mighte, They spedde hem fro the souper un-to bedde; And every wight out at the dore him dighte, And wher him list upon his wey he spedde; But Troilus, that thoughte his herte bledde For wo, til that he herde som tydinge, He seyde, ‘freend, shal I now wepe or singe?’ 137 Quod Pandarus, ‘ly stille, and lat me slepe, And don thyn hood, thy nedes spedde be; And chese, if thou wolt singe or daunce or lepe; At shorte wordes, thow shalt trowe me.— Sire, my nece wol do wel by thee, And love thee best, by god and by my trouthe, But lak of pursuit make it in thy slouthe. 138 For thus ferforth I have thy work bigonne, Fro day to day, til this day, by the morwe, Hir love of freendship have I to thee wonne, And also hath she leyd hir feyth to borwe. Algate a foot is hameled of thy sorwe.’ What sholde I lenger sermon of it holde? As ye han herd bifore, al he him tolde. 139 But right as floures, thorugh the colde of night Y-closed, stoupen on hir stalkes lowe, Redressen hem a-yein the sonne bright, And spreden on hir kinde cours by rowe; Right so gan tho his eyen up to throwe This Troilus, and seyde, ‘O Venus dere, Thy might, thy grace, y-heried be it here!’ 140 And to Pandare he held up bothe his hondes, And seyde, ‘lord, al thyn be that I have; For I am hool, al brosten been my bondes; A thousand Troians who so that me yave, Eche after other, god so wis me save, Ne mighte me so gladen; lo, myn herte, It spredeth so for Ioye, it wol to-sterte! 141 But lord, how shal I doon, how shal I liven? Whan shal I next my dere herte see? How shal this longe tyme a-wey be driven, Til that thou be ayein at hir fro me? Thou mayst answere, “a-byd, a-byd,” but he That hangeth by the nekke, sooth to seyne, In grete disese abydeth for the peyne.’ 142 ‘Al esily, now, for the love of Marte,’ Quod Pandarus, ‘for every thing hath tyme; So longe abyd til that the night departe; For al so siker as thow lyst here by me, And god toforn, I wol be there at pryme, And for thy werk somwhat as I shal seye, Or on som other wight this charge leye. 143 For pardee, god wot, I have ever yit Ben redy thee to serve, and to this night Have I nought fayned, but emforth my wit Don al thy lust, and shal with al my might. Do now as I shal seye, and fare a-right; And if thou nilt, wyte al thy-self thy care, On me is nought along thyn yvel fare. 144 I woot wel that thow wyser art than I A thousand fold, but if I were as thou, God helpe me so, as I wolde outrely, Right of myn owene hond, wryte hir right now A lettre, in which I wolde hir tellen how I ferde amis, and hir beseche of routhe; Now help thy-self, and leve it not for slouthe. 145 And I my-self shal ther-with to hir goon; And whan thou wost that I am with hir there, Worth thou up-on a courser right anoon, Ye, hardily, right in thy beste gere, And ryd forth by the place, as nought ne were, And thou shalt finde us, if I may, sittinge At som windowe, in-to the strete lokinge. 146 And if thee list, than maystow us saluwe, And up-on me makë thy contenaunce; But, by thy lyf, be war and faste eschuwe To tarien ought, god shilde us fro mischaunce! Ryd forth thy wey, and hold thy governaunce; And we shal speke of thee som-what, I trowe, Whan thou art goon, to do thyne eres glowe! 147 Touching thy lettre, thou art wys y-nough, I woot thow nilt it digneliche endyte; As make it with thise argumentes tough; Ne scrivenish or craftily thou it wryte; Beblotte it with thy teres eek a lyte; And if thou wryte a goodly word al softe, Though it be good, reherce it not to ofte. 148 For though the beste harpour upon lyve Wolde on the beste souned Ioly harpe That ever was, with alle his fingres fyve, Touche ay o streng, or ay o werbul harpe, Were his nayles poynted never so sharpe, It shulde maken every wight to dulle, To here his glee, and of his strokes fulle. 149 Ne Iompre eek no discordaunt thing y-fere, As thus, to usen termes of phisyk; In loves termes, hold of thy matere The forme alwey, and do that it be lyk; For if a peyntour wolde peynte a pyk With asses feet, and hede it as an ape, It cordeth nought; so nere it but a Iape.’ 150 This counseyl lyked wel to Troilus; But, as a dreedful lover, he seyde this:— ‘Allas, my dere brother Pandarus, I am ashamed for to wryte, y-wis, Lest of myn innocence I seyde a-mis, Or that she nolde it for despyt receyve; Thanne were I deed, ther mighte it no-thing weyve.’ 151 To that Pandare answerde, ‘if thee lest, Do that I seye, and lat me therwith goon; For by that lord that formed est and west, I hope of it to bringe answere anoon Right of hir hond, and if that thou nilt noon, Lat be; and sory mote he been his lyve, Ayeins thy lust that helpeth thee to thryve.’ 152 Quod Troilus, ‘Depardieux, I assente; Sin that thee list, I will aryse and wryte; And blisful god preye ich, with good entente, The vyage, and the lettre I shal endyte, So spede it; and thou, Minerva, the whyte, Yif thou me wit my lettre to devyse:’ And sette him doun, and wroot right in this wyse. 153 First he gan hir his righte lady calle, His hertes lyf, his lust, his sorwes leche, His blisse, and eek this othere termes alle, That in swich cas these loveres alle seche; And in ful humble wyse, as in his speche, He gan him recomaunde un-to hir grace; To telle al how, it axeth muchel space. 154 And after this, ful lowly he hir prayde To be nought wrooth, though he, of his folye, So hardy was to hir to wryte, and seyde, That love it made, or elles moste he dye, And pitiously gan mercy for to crye; And after that he seyde, and ley ful loude, Him-self was litel worth, and lesse he coude; 155 And that she sholde han his conning excused, That litel was, and eek he dredde hir so, And his unworthinesse he ay acused; And after that, than gan he telle his wo; But that was endeles, with-outen ho; And seyde, he wolde in trouthe alwey him holde,— And radde it over, and gan the lettre folde. 156 And with his salte teres gan he bathe The ruby in his signet, and it sette Upon the wex deliverliche and rathe; Ther-with a thousand tymes, er he lette, He kiste tho the lettre that he shette, And seyde, ‘lettre, a blisful destenee Thee shapen is, my lady shal thee see.’ 157 This Pandare took the lettre, and that by tyme A-morwe, and to his neces paleys sterte, And faste he swoor, that it was passed pryme, And gan to Iape, and seyde, ‘y-wis, myn herte, So fresh it is, al-though it sore smerte, I may not slepe never a Mayes morwe; I have a Ioly wo, a lusty sorwe.’ 158 Criseyde, whan that she hir uncle herde, With dreedful herte, and desirous to here The cause of his cominge, thus answerde, ‘Now by your feyth, myn uncle,’ quod she, ‘dere, What maner windes gydeth yow now here? Tel us your Ioly wo and your penaunce, How ferforth be ye put in loves daunce.’ 159 ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘I hoppe alwey bihinde!’ And she to-laugh, it thoughte hir herte breste. Quod Pandarus, ‘loke alwey that ye finde Game in myn hood, but herkneth, if yow leste; Ther is right now come in-to toune a geste, A Greek espye, and telleth newe thinges, For which come I to telle yow tydinges. 160 Into the gardin go we, and we shal here, Al prevely, of this a long sermoun.’ With that they wenten arm in arm y-fere In-to the gardin from the chaumbre doun. And whan that he so fer was that the soun Of that he speke, no man here mighte, He seyde hir thus, and out the lettre plighte, 161 ‘Lo, he that is al hoolly youres free Him recomaundeth lowly to your grace, And sent to you this lettre here by me; Avyseth you on it, whan ye han space, And of som goodly answere yow purchace; Or, helpe me god, so pleynly for to seyne, He may not longe liven for his peyne.’ 162 Ful dredfully tho gan she stonde stille, And took it nought, but al hir humble chere Gan for to chaunge, and seyde, ‘scrit ne bille, For love of god, that toucheth swich matere, Ne bring me noon; and also, uncle dere, To myn estat have more reward, I preye, Than to his lust; what sholde I more seye? 163 And loketh now if this be resonable, And letteth nought, for favour ne for slouthe, To seyn a sooth; now were it covenable To myn estat, by god, and by your trouthe, To taken it, or to han of him routhe, In harming of my-self or in repreve? Ber it a-yein, for him that ye on leve!’ 164 This Pandarus gan on hir for to stare, And seyde, ‘now is this the grettest wonder That ever I sey! lat be this nyce fare! To deethe mote I smiten be with thonder, If, for the citee which that stondeth yonder, Wolde I a lettre un-to yow bringe or take To harm of yow; what list yow thus it make? 165 But thus ye faren, wel neigh alle and some, That he that most desireth yow to serve, Of him ye recche leest wher he bicome, And whether that he live or elles sterve. But for al that that ever I may deserve, Refuse it nought,’ quod he, and hente hir faste, And in hir bosom the lettre doun he thraste, 166 And seyde hir, ‘now cast it away anoon, That folk may seen and gauren on us tweye.’ Quod she, ‘I can abyde til they be goon,’ And gan to smyle, and seyde him, ‘eem, I preye, Swich answere as yow list your-self purveye, For trewely I nil no lettre wryte.’ ‘No? than wol I,’ quod he, ‘so ye endyte.’ 167 Therwith she lough, and seyde, ‘go we dyne.’ And he gan at him-self to iape faste, And seyde, ‘nece, I have so greet a pyne For love, that every other day I faste’— And gan his beste Iapes forth to caste; And made hir so to laughe at his folye, That she for laughter wende for to dye. 168 And whan that she was comen in-to halle, ‘Now, eem,’ quod she, ‘we wol go dyne anoon;’ And gan some of hir women to hir calle, And streyght in-to hir chaumbre gan she goon; But of hir besinesses, this was oon A-monges othere thinges, out of drede, Ful prively this lettre for to rede; 169 Avysed word by word in every lyne, And fond no lak, she thoughte he coude good; And up it putte, and went hir in to dyne. And Pandarus, that in a study stood, Er he was war, she took him by the hood, And seyde, ‘ye were caught er that ye wiste;’ ‘I vouche sauf,’ quod he, ‘do what yow liste.’ 170 Tho wesshen they, and sette hem doun and ete; And after noon ful sleyly Pandarus Gan drawe him to the window next the strete, And seyde, ‘nece, who hath arayed thus The yonder hous, that stant afor-yeyn us?’ ‘Which hous?’ quod she, and gan for to biholde, And knew it wel, and whos it was him tolde, 171 And fillen forth in speche of thinges smale, And seten in the window bothe tweye. Whan Pandarus saw tyme un-to his tale, And saw wel that hir folk were alle aweye, ‘Now, nece myn, tel on,’ quod he, ‘I seye, How lyketh yow the lettre that ye woot? Can he ther-on? for, by my trouthe, I noot.’ 172 Therwith al rosy hewed tho wex she, And gan to humme, and seyde, ‘so I trowe.’ ‘Aquyte him wel, for goddes love,’ quod he; ‘My-self to medes wol the lettre sowe,’ And held his hondes up, and sat on knowe, ‘Now, goode nece, be it never so lyte, Yif me the labour, it to sowe and plyte.’ 173 ‘Ye, for I can so wryte,’ quod she tho; ‘And eek I noot what I sholde to him seye.’ ‘Nay, nece,’ quod Pandare, ‘sey not so; Yet at the leste thanketh him, I preye, Of his good wil, and doth him not to deye. Now for the love of me, my nece dere, Refuseth not at this tyme my preyere.’ 174 ‘Depar-dieux,’ quod she, ‘god leve al be wel! God helpe me so, this is the firste lettre That ever I wroot, ye, al or any del.’ And in-to a closet, for to avyse hir bettre, She wente allone, and gan hir herte unfettre Out of disdaynes prison but a lyte; And sette hir doun, and gan a lettre wryte, 175 Of which to telle in short is myn entente Theffect, as fer as I can understonde:— She thonked him of al that he wel mente Towardes hir, but holden him in honde She nolde nought, ne make hir-selven bonde In love, but as his suster, him to plese, She wolde fayn, to doon his herte an ese. 176 She shette it, and to Pandarus gan goon, There as he sat and loked in-to strete, And doun she sette hir by him on a stoon Of Iaspre, up-on a quisshin gold y-bete, And seyde, ‘as wisly helpe me god the grete, I never dide a thing with more peyne Than wryte this, to which ye me constreyne;’ 177 And took it him: he thonked hir and seyde, ‘God woot, of thing ful ofte looth bigonne Cometh ende good; and nece myn, Criseyde, That ye to him of hard now ben y-wonne Oughte he be glad, by god and yonder sonne! For-why men seyth, “impressiounes lighte Ful lightly been ay redy to the flighte.” 178 But ye han pleyed tyraunt neigh to longe, And hard was it your herte for to grave; Now stint, that ye no longer on it honge, Al wolde ye the forme of daunger save. But hasteth yow to doon him Ioye have; For trusteth wel, to longe y-doon hardnesse Causeth despyt ful often, for distresse.’ 179 And right as they declamed this matere, Lo, Troilus, right at the stretes ende, Com ryding with his tenthe some y-fere, Al softely, and thiderward gan bende Ther-as they sete, as was his wey to wende To paleys-ward; and Pandare him aspyde, And seyde, ‘nece, y-see who cometh here ryde! 180 O flee not in, he seeth us, I suppose; Lest he may thinke that ye him eschuwe.’ ‘Nay, nay,’ quod she, and wex as reed as rose. With that he gan hir humbly to saluwe, With dreedful chere, and ofte his hewes muwe; And up his look debonairly he caste, And bekked on Pandare, and forth he paste. 181 God woot if he sat on his hors a-right, Or goodly was beseyn, that ilke day! God woot wher he was lyk a manly knight! What sholde I drecche, or telle of his aray? Criseyde, which that alle these thinges say, To telle in short, hir lyked al y-fere, His persone, his aray, his look, his chere, 182 His goodly manere and his gentillesse, So wel, that never, sith that she was born, Ne hadde she swich routhe of his distresse; And how-so she hath hard ben her-biforn, To god hope I, she hath now caught a thorn. She shal not pulle it out this nexte wyke; God sende mo swich thornes on to pyke! 183 Pandare, which that stood hir faste by, Felte iren hoot, and he bigan to smyte, And seyde, ‘nece, I pray yow hertely, Tel me that I shal axen yow a lyte. A womman, that were of his deeth to wyte, With-outen his gilt, but for hir lakked routhe, Were it wel doon?’ Quod she, ‘nay, by my trouthe!’ 184 ‘God helpe me so,’ quod he, ‘ye sey me sooth. Ye felen wel your-self that I not lye; Lo, yond he rit!’ Quod she, ‘ye, so he dooth.’ ‘Wel,’ quod Pandare, ‘as I have told yow thrye, Lat be your nyce shame and your folye, And spek with him in esing of his herte; Lat nycetee not do yow bothe smerte.’ 185 But ther-on was to heven and to done; Considered al thing, it may not be; And why, for shame; and it were eek to sone To graunten him so greet a libertee. ‘For playnly hir entente,’ as seyde she, Was for to love him unwist, if she mighte, And guerdon him with no-thing but with sighte.’ 186 But Pandarus thoughte, ‘it shal not be so, If that I may; this nyce opinioun Shal not be holden fully yeres two.’ What sholde I make of this a long sermoun? He moste assente on that conclusioun As for the tyme; and whan that it was eve, And al was wel, he roos and took his leve. 187 And on his wey ful faste homward he spedde, And right for Ioye he felte his herte daunce; And Troilus he fond alone a-bedde, That lay as dooth these loveres, in a traunce, Bitwixen hope and derk desesperaunce. But Pandarus, right at his in-cominge, He song, as who seyth, ‘lo! sumwhat I bringe.’ 188 And seyde, ‘who is in his bed so sone Y-buried thus?’ ‘It am I, freend,’ quod he. ‘Who, Troilus? nay helpe me so the mone,’ Quod Pandarus, ‘thou shalt aryse and see A charme that was sent right now to thee, The which can helen thee of thyn accesse, If thou do forth-with al thy besinesse.’ 189 ‘Ye, through the might of god!’ quod Troilus. And Pandarus gan him the lettre take, And seyde, ‘pardee, god hath holpen us; Have here a light, and loke on al this blake.’ But ofte gan the herte glade and quake Of Troilus, whyl that he gan it rede, So as the wordes yave him hope or drede. 190 But fynally, he took al for the beste That she him wroot, for sumwhat he biheld On which, him thoughte, he mighte his herte reste, Al covered she the wordes under sheld. Thus to the more worthy part he held, That, what for hope and Pandarus biheste, His grete wo for-yede he at the leste. 191 But as we may alday our-selven see, Through more wode or col, the more fyr; Right so encrees of hope, of what it be, Therwith ful ofte encreseth eek desyr; Or, as an ook cometh of a litel spyr, So through this lettre, which that she him sente, Encresen gan desyr, of which he brente. 192 Wherfore I seye alwey, that day and night This Troilus gan to desiren more Than he dide erst, thurgh hope, and dide his might To pressen on, as by Pandarus lore, And wryten to hir of his sorwes sore Fro day to day; he leet it not refreyde, That by Pandare he wroot somwhat or seyde; 193 And dide also his othere observaunces That to a lovere longeth in this cas; And, after that these dees turnede on chaunces, So was he outher glad or seyde ‘allas!’ And held after his gestes ay his pas; And aftir swiche answeres as he hadde, So were his dayes sory outher gladde. 194 But to Pandare alwey was his recours, And pitously gan ay til him to pleyne, And him bisoughte of rede and som socours; And Pandarus, that sey his wode peyne, Wex wel neigh deed for routhe, sooth to seyne, And bisily with al his herte caste Som of his wo to sleen, and that as faste; 195 And seyde, ‘lord, and freend, and brother dere, God woot that thy disese dooth me wo. But woltow stinten al this woful chere, And, by my trouthe, or it be dayes two, And god to-forn, yet shal I shape it so, That thou shalt come in-to a certayn place, Ther-as thou mayst thy-self hir preye of grace. 196 And certainly, I noot if thou it wost, But tho that been expert in love it seye, It is oon of the thinges that furthereth most, A man to have a leyser for to preye, And siker place his wo for to biwreye; For in good herte it moot som routhe impresse, To here and see the giltles in distresse. 197 Paraunter thenkestow: though it be so That kinde wolde doon hir to biginne To han a maner routhe up-on my wo, Seyth Daunger, “Nay, thou shalt me never winne; So reuleth hir hir hertes goost with-inne, That, though she bende, yet she stant on rote; What in effect is this un-to my bote?” 198 Thenk here-ayeins, whan that the sturdy ook, On which men hakketh ofte, for the nones, Receyved hath the happy falling strook, The grete sweigh doth it come al at ones, As doon these rokkes or these milne-stones. For swifter cours cometh thing that is of wighte, Whan it descendeth, than don thinges lighte. 199 And reed that boweth doun for every blast, Ful lightly, cesse wind, it wol aryse; But so nil not an ook whan it is cast; It nedeth me nought thee longe to forbyse. Men shal reioysen of a greet empryse Acheved wel, and stant with-outen doute, Al han men been the lenger ther-aboute. 200 But, Troilus, yet tel me, if thee lest, A thing now which that I shal axen thee; Which is thy brother that thou lovest best As in thy verray hertes privetee?’ ‘Y-wis, my brother Deiphebus,’ quod he. ‘Now,’ quod Pandare, ‘er houres twyes twelve, He shal thee ese, unwist of it him-selve. 201 Now lat me allone, and werken as I may,’ Quod he; and to Deiphebus wente he tho Which hadde his lord and grete freend ben ay; Save Troilus, no man he lovede so. To telle in short, with-outen wordes mo, Quod Pandarus, ‘I pray yow that ye be Freend to a cause which that toucheth me.’ 202 ‘Yis, pardee,’ quod Deiphebus, ‘wel thow wost, In al that ever I may, and god to-fore, Al nere it but for man I love most, My brother Troilus; but sey wherfore It is; for sith that day that I was bore, I nas, ne never-mo to been I thinke, Ayeins a thing that mighte thee for-thinke.’ 203 Pandare gan him thonke, and to him seyde, ‘Lo, sire, I have a lady in this toun, That is my nece, and called is Criseyde, Which som men wolden doon oppressioun, And wrongfully have hir possessioun: Wherfor I of your lordship yow biseche To been our freend, with-oute more speche.’ 204 Deiphebus him answerde, ‘O, is not this, That thow spekest of to me thus straungely, Crisëyda, my freend?’ He seyde, ‘Yis.’ ‘Than nedeth,’ quod Deiphebus hardely, Na-more to speke, for trusteth wel, that I Wol be hir champioun with spore and yerde; I roughte nought though alle hir foos it herde. 205 But tel me, thou that woost al this matere, How I might best avaylen? now lat see.’ Quod Pandarus, ‘if ye, my lord so dere, Wolden as now don this honour to me, To prayen hir to-morwe, lo, that she Com un-to yow hir pleyntes to devyse, Hir adversaries wolde of hit agryse. 206 And if I more dorste preye as now, And chargen yow to have so greet travayle, To han som of your bretheren here with yow, That mighten to hir cause bet avayle, Than, woot I wel, she mighte never fayle For to be holpen, what at your instaunce, What with hir othere freendes governaunce.’ 207 Deiphebus, which that comen was, of kinde, To al honour and bountee to consente, Answerde, ‘it shal be doon; and I can finde Yet gretter help to this in myn entente. What wolt thow seyn, if I for Eleyne sente To speke of this? I trowe it be the beste; For she may leden Paris as hir leste. 208 Of Ector, which that is my lord, my brother, It nedeth nought to preye him freend to be; For I have herd him, o tyme and eek other, Speke of Criseyde swich honour, that he May seyn no bet, swich hap to him hath she. It nedeth nought his helpes for to crave; He shal be swich, right as we wole him have. 209 Spek thou thy-self also to Troilus On my bihalve, and pray him with us dyne.’ ‘Sire, al this shal be doon,’ quod Pandarus; And took his leve, and never gan to fyne, But to his neces hous, as streyt as lyne, He com; and fond hir fro the mete aryse; And sette him doun, and spak right in this wyse. 210 He seyde, ‘O veray god, so have I ronne! Lo, nece myn, see ye nought how I swete? I noot whether ye the more thank me conne. Be ye nought war how that fals Poliphete Is now aboute eft-sones for to plete, And bringe on yow advocacyës newe?’ ‘I? no,’ quod she, and chaunged al hir hewe. 211 ‘What is he more aboute, me to drecche And doon me wrong? what shal I do, allas? Yet of him-self no-thing ne wolde I recche, Nere it for Antenor and Eneas, That been his freendes in swich maner cas; But, for the love of god, myn uncle dere, No fors of that, lat him have al y-fere; 212 With-outen that, I have ynough for us.’ ‘Nay,’ quod Pandare, ‘it shal no-thing be so. For I have been right now at Deiphebus, And Ector, and myne othere lordes mo, And shortly maked eche of hem his fo; That, by my thrift, he shal it never winne For ought he can, whan that so he biginne.’ 213 And as they casten what was best to done, Deiphebus, of his owene curtasye, Com hir to preye, in his propre persone, To holde him on the morwe companye At diner, which she nolde not denye, But goodly gan to his preyere obeye. He thonked hir, and wente up-on his weye. 214 Whanne this was doon, this Pandare up a-noon, To telle in short, and forth gan for to wende To Troilus, as stille as any stoon, And al this thing he tolde him, word and ende; And how that he Deiphebus gan to blende; And seyde him, ‘now is tyme, if that thou conne, To bere thee wel to-morwe, and al is wonne. 215 Now spek, now prey, now pitously compleyne; Lat not for nyce shame, or drede, or slouthe; Som-tyme a man mot telle his owene peyne; Bileve it, and she shal han on thee routhe; Thou shalt be saved by thy feyth, in trouthe. But wel wot I, thou art now in a drede; And what it is, I leye, I can arede. 216 Thow thinkest now, “how sholde I doon al this? For by my cheres mosten folk aspye, That for hir love is that I fare a-mis; Yet hadde I lever unwist for sorwe dye.” Now thenk not so, for thou dost greet folye. For right now have I founden o manere Of sleighte, for to coveren al thy chere. 217 Thow shalt gon over night, and that as blyve, Un-to Deiphebus hous, as thee to pleye, Thy maladye a-wey the bet to dryve, For-why thou semest syk, soth for to seye. Sone after that, doun in thy bed thee leye, And sey, thow mayst no lenger up endure, And lye right there, and byde thyn aventure. 218 Sey that thy fever is wont thee for to take The same tyme, and lasten til a-morwe; And lat see now how wel thou canst it make, For, par-dee, syk is he that is in sorwe. Go now, farewel! and, Venus here to borwe, I hope, and thou this purpos holde ferme, Thy grace she shal fully ther conferme.’ 219 Quod Troilus, ‘y-wis, thou nedelees Counseylest me, that sykliche I me feyne! For I am syk in ernest, doutelees, So that wel neigh I sterve for the peyne.’ Quod Pandarus, ‘thou shalt the bettre pleyne, And hast the lasse nede to countrefete; For him men demen hoot that men seen swete. 220 Lo, holde thee at thy triste cloos, and I Shal wel the deer un-to thy bowe dryve.’ Therwith he took his leve al softely, And Troilus to paleys wente blyve. So glad ne was he never in al his lyve; And to Pandarus reed gan al assente, And to Deiphebus hous at night he wente. 221 What nedeth yow to tellen al the chere That Deiphebus un-to his brother made, Or his accesse, or his syklych manere, How men gan him with clothes for to lade, Whan he was leyd, and how men wolde him glade? But al for nought, he held forth ay the wyse That ye han herd Pandare er this devyse. 222 But certeyn is, er Troilus him leyde, Deiphebus had him prayed, over night, To been a freend and helping to Criseyde. God woot, that he it grauntede anon-right, To been hir fulle freend with al his might. But swich a nede was to preye him thenne, As for to bidde a wood man for to renne. 223 The morwen com, and neighen gan the tyme Of meel-tyd, that the faire quene Eleyne Shoop hir to been, an houre after the pryme, With Deiphebus, to whom she nolde feyne; But as his suster, hoomly, sooth to seyne, She com to diner in hir playn entente. But god and Pandare wiste al what this mente. 224 Come eek Criseyde, al innocent of this, Antigone, hir sister Tarbe also; But flee we now prolixitee best is, For love of god, and lat us faste go Right to the effect, with-oute tales mo, Why al this folk assembled in this place; And lat us of hir saluinges pace. 225 Gret honour dide hem Deiphebus, certeyn, And fedde hem wel with al that mighte lyke. But ever-more, ‘allas!’ was his refreyn, ‘My goode brother Troilus, the syke, Lyth yet’—and therwith-al he gan to syke; And after that, he peyned him to glade Hem as he mighte, and chere good he made. 226 Compleyned eek Eleyne of his syknesse So feithfully, that pitee was to here, And every wight gan waxen for accesse A leche anoon, and seyde, ‘in this manere Men curen folk; this charme I wol yow lere.’ But there sat oon, al list hir nought to teche, That thoughte, best coude I yet been his leche. 227 After compleynt, him gonnen they to preyse, As folk don yet, whan som wight hath bigonne To preyse a man, and up with prys him reyse A thousand fold yet hyer than the sonne:— ‘He is, he can, that fewe lordes conne.’ And Pandarus, of that they wolde afferme, He not for-gat hir preysing to conferme. 228 Herde al this thing Criseyde wel y-nough, And every word gan for to notifye; For which with sobre chere hir herte lough; For who is that ne wolde hir glorifye, To mowen swich a knight don live or dye? But al passe I, lest ye to longe dwelle; For for o fyn is al that ever I telle. 229 The tyme com, fro diner for to ryse, And, as hem oughte, arisen everychoon, And gonne a while of this and that devyse. But Pandarus brak al this speche anoon, And seyde to Deiphebus, ‘wole ye goon, If yourë wille be, as I yow preyde, To speke here of the nedes of Criseyde?’ 230 Eleyne, which that by the hond hir held, Took first the tale, and seyde, ‘go we blyve;’ And goodly on Criseyde she biheld, And seyde, ‘Ioves lat him never thryve, That dooth yow harm, and bringe him sone of lyve And yeve me sorwe, but he shal it rewe, If that I may, and alle folk be trewe.’ 231 ‘Tel thou thy neces cas,’ quod Deiphebus To Pandarus, ‘for thou canst best it telle.’— ‘My lordes and my ladyes, it stant thus; What sholde I lenger,’ quod he, ‘do yow dwelle?’ He rong hem out a proces lyk a belle, Up-on hir fo, that highte Poliphete, So hëynous, that men mighte on it spete. 232 Answerde of this ech worse of hem than other, And Poliphete they gonnen thus to warien, ‘An-honged be swich oon, were he my brother; And so he shal, for it ne may not varien.’ What sholde I lenger in this tale tarien? Pleynly, alle at ones, they hir highten, To been hir helpe in al that ever they mighten. 233 Spak than Eleyne, and seyde, ‘Pandarus, Woot ought my lord, my brother, this matere, I mene, Ector? or woot it Troilus?’ He seyde, ‘ye, but wole ye now me here? Me thinketh this, sith Troilus is here, It were good, if that ye wolde assente, She tolde hir-self him al this, er she wente. 234 For he wole have the more hir grief at herte, By cause, lo, that she a lady is; And, by your leve, I wol but right in sterte, And do yow wite, and that anoon, y-wis, If that he slepe, or wole ought here of this.’ And in he lepte, and seyde him in his ere, ‘God have thy soule, y-brought have I thy bere!’ 235 To smylen of this gan tho Troilus, And Pandarus, with-oute rekeninge, Out wente anoon to Eleyne and Deiphebus, And seyde hem, ‘so there be no taryinge, Ne more pres, he wol wel that ye bringe Crisëyda, my lady, that is here; And as he may enduren, he wole here. 236 But wel ye woot, the chaumbre is but lyte, And fewe folk may lightly make it warm; Now loketh ye, (for I wol have no wyte, To bringe in prees that mighte doon him harm Or him disesen, for my bettre arm), Wher it be bet she byde til eft-sones; Now loketh ye, that knowen what to doon is. 237 I sey for me, best is, as I can knowe, That no wight in ne wente but ye tweye, But it were I, for I can, in a throwe, Reherce hir cas, unlyk that she can seye; And after this, she may him ones preye To ben good lord, in short, and take hir leve; This may not muchel of his ese him reve. 238 And eek, for she is straunge, he wol forbere His ese, which that him thar nought for yow; Eek other thing, that toucheth not to here, He wol me telle, I woot it wel right now, That secret is, and for the tounes prow.’ And they, that no-thing knewe of this entente, With-oute more, to Troilus in they wente. 239 Eleyne in al hir goodly softe wyse, Gan him saluwe, and womanly to pleye, And seyde, ‘ywis, ye moste alweyes aryse! Now fayre brother, beth al hool, I preye!’ And gan hir arm right over his sholder leye, And him with al hir wit to recomforte; As she best coude, she gan him to disporte. 240 So after this quod she, ‘we yow biseke, My dere brother, Deiphebus, and I, For love of god, and so doth Pandare eke, To been good lord and freend, right hertely, Un-to Criseyde, which that certeinly Receyveth wrong, as woot wel here Pandare, That can hir cas wel bet than I declare.’ 241 This Pandarus gan newe his tunge affyle, And al hir cas reherce, and that anoon; Whan it was seyd, sone after, in a whyle, Quod Troilus, ‘as sone as I may goon, I wol right fayn with al my might ben oon, Have god my trouthe, hir cause to sustene.’ ‘Good thrift have ye,’ quod Eleyne the quene. 242 Quod Pandarus, ‘and it your wille be, That she may take hir leve, er that she go?’ ‘Or elles god for-bede,’ tho quod he, ‘If that she vouche sauf for to do so.’ And with that word quod Troilus, ‘ye two, Deiphebus, and my suster leef and dere, To yow have I to speke of o matere, 243 To been avysed by your reed the bettre’:— And fond, as hap was, at his beddes heed, The copie of a tretis and a lettre, That Ector hadde him sent to axen reed, If swich a man was worthy to ben deed, Woot I nought who; but in a grisly wyse He preyede hem anoon on it avyse. 244 Deiphebus gan this lettre to unfolde In ernest greet; so dide Eleyne the quene; And rominge outward, fast it gan biholde, Downward a steyre, in-to an herber grene. This ilke thing they redden hem bi-twene; And largely, the mountaunce of an houre, They gonne on it to reden and to poure. 245 Now lat hem rede, and turne we anoon To Pandarus, that gan ful faste prye That al was wel, and out he gan to goon In-to the grete chambre, and that in hye, And seyde, ‘god save al this companye! Com, nece myn; my lady quene Eleyne Abydeth yow, and eek my lordes tweyne. 246 Rys, take with yow your nece Antigone, Or whom yow list, or no fors, hardily; The lasse prees, the bet; com forth with me, And loke that ye thonke humblely Hem alle three, and, whan ye may goodly Your tyme y-see, taketh of hem your leve, Lest we to longe his restes him bireve.’ 247 Al innocent of Pandarus entente, Quod tho Criseyde, ‘go we, uncle dere’; And arm in arm inward with him she wente, Avysed wel hir wordes and hir chere; And Pandarus, in ernestful manere, Seyde, ‘alle folk, for goddes love, I preye, Stinteth right here, and softely yow pleye. 248 Aviseth yow what folk ben here with-inne, And in what plyt oon is, god him amende! And inward thus ful softely biginne; Nece, I coniure and heighly yow defende, On his half, which that sowle us alle sende, And in the vertue of corounes tweyne, Slee nought this man, that hath for yow this peyne! 249 Fy on the devel! thenk which oon he is, And in what plyt he lyth; com of anoon; Thenk al swich taried tyd, but lost it nis! That wol ye bothe seyn, whan ye ben oon. Secoundelich, ther yet devyneth noon Up-on yow two; com of now, if ye conne; Whyl folk is blent, lo, al the tyme is wonne! 250 In titering, and pursuite, and delayes, The folk devyne at wagginge of a stree; And though ye wolde han after merye dayes, Than dar ye nought, and why? for she, and she Spak swich a word; thus loked he, and he; Lest tyme I loste, I dar not with yow dele; Com of therfore, and bringeth him to hele.’ 251 But now to yow, ye lovers that ben here, Was Troilus nought in a cankedort, That lay, and mighte whispringe of hem here, And thoughte, ‘O lord, right now renneth my sort Fully to dye, or han anoon comfort’; And was the firste tyme he shulde hir preye Of love; O mighty god, what shal he seye?

O verray cause of hele and of gladnesse, Y-heried be thy might and thy goodnesse! 2 In hevene and helle, in erthe and salte see Is felt thy might, if that I wel descerne; As man, brid, best, fish, herbe and grene tree Thee fele in tymes with vapour eterne. God loveth, and to love wol nought werne; And in this world no lyves creature, With-outen love, is worth, or may endure. 3 Ye Ioves first to thilke effectes glade, Thorugh which that thinges liven alle and be, Comeveden, and amorous him made On mortal thing, and as yow list, ay ye Yeve him in love ese or adversitee; And in a thousand formes doun him sente For love in erthe, and whom yow liste, he hente. 4 Ye fierse Mars apeysen of his ire, And, as yow list, ye maken hertes digne; Algates, hem that ye wol sette a-fyre, They dreden shame, and vices they resigne; Ye do hem corteys be, fresshe and benigne, And hye or lowe, after a wight entendeth; The Ioyes that he hath, your might him sendeth. 5 Ye holden regne and hous in unitee; Ye soothfast cause of frendship been also; Ye knowe al thilke covered qualitee Of thinges which that folk on wondren so, Whan they can not construe how it may io, She loveth him, or why he loveth here; As why this fish, and nought that, cometh to were. 6 Ye folk a lawe han set in universe, And this knowe I by hem that loveres be, That who-so stryveth with yow hath the werse: Now, lady bright, for thy benignitee, At reverence of hem that serven thee, Whos clerk I am, so techeth me devyse Som Ioye of that is felt in thy servyse. 7 Ye in my naked herte sentement Inhelde, and do me shewe of thy swetnesse.— Caliope, thy vois be now present, For now is nede; sestow not my destresse, How I mot telle anon-right the gladnesse Of Troilus, to Venus heryinge?

Incipit Liber Tercius. 8 Lay al this mene whyle Troilus, Recordinge his lessoun in this manere, ‘Ma fey!’ thought he, ‘thus wole I seye and thus; Thus wole I pleyne un-to my lady dere; That word is good, and this shal be my chere; This nil I not foryeten in no wyse.’ God leve him werken as he gan devyse. 9 And lord, so that his herte gan to quappe, Heringe hir come, and shorte for to syke! And Pandarus, that ladde hir by the lappe, Com ner, and gan in at the curtin pyke, And seyde, ‘god do bote on alle syke! See, who is here yow comen to visyte; Lo, here is she that is your deeth to wyte.’ 10 Ther-with it semed as he wepte almost; ‘A ha,’ quod Troilus so rewfully, ‘Wher me be wo, O mighty god, thou wost! Who is al there? I see nought trewely.’ ‘Sire,’ quod Criseyde, ‘it is Pandare and I.’ ‘Ye, swete herte? allas, I may nought ryse To knele, and do yow honour in som wyse.’ 11 And dressede him upward, and she right tho Gan bothe here hondes softe upon him leye, ‘O, for the love of god, do ye not so To me,’ quod she, ‘ey! what is this to seye? Sire, come am I to yow for causes tweye; First, yow to thonke, and of your lordshipe eke Continuaunce I wolde yow biseke.’ 12 This Troilus, that herde his lady preye Of lordship him, wex neither quik ne deed, Ne mighte a word for shame to it seye, Al-though men sholde smyten of his heed. But lord, so he wex sodeinliche reed, And sire, his lesson, that he wende conne, To preyen hir, is thurgh his wit y-ronne. 13 Cryseyde al this aspyede wel y-nough, For she was wys, and lovede him never-the-lasse, Al nere he malapert, or made it tough, Or was to bold, to singe a fool a masse. But whan his shame gan somwhat to passe, His resons, as I may my rymes holde, I yow wol telle, as techen bokes olde. 14 In chaunged vois, right for his verrey drede, Which vois eek quook, and ther-to his manere Goodly abayst, and now his hewes rede, Now pale, un-to Criseyde, his lady dere, With look doun cast and humble yolden chere, Lo, the alderfirste word that him asterte Was, twyes, ‘mercy, mercy, swete herte!’ 15 And stinte a whyl, and whan he mighte out-bringe, The nexte word was, ‘god wot, for I have, As feythfully as I have had konninge, Ben youres, also god my sowle save; And shal, til that I, woful wight, be grave. And though I dar ne can un-to yow pleyne, Y-wis, I suffre nought the lasse peyne. 16 Thus muche as now, O wommanliche wyf, I may out-bringe, and if this yow displese, That shal I wreke upon myn owne lyf Right sone, I trowe, and doon your herte an ese, If with my deeth your herte I may apese. But sin that ye han herd me som-what seye, Now recche I never how sone that I deye.’ 17 Ther-with his manly sorwe to biholde, It mighte han maad an herte of stoon to rewe; And Pandare weep as he to watre wolde, And poked ever his nece newe and newe, And seyde, ‘wo bigon ben hertes trewe! For love of god, make of this thing an ende, Or slee us bothe at ones, er that ye wende.’ 18 ‘I? what?’ quod she, ‘by god and by my trouthe, I noot nought what ye wilne that I seye.’ ‘I? what?’ quod he, ‘that ye han on him routhe, For goddes love, and doth him nought to deye.’ ‘Now thanne thus,’ quod she, ‘I wolde him preye To telle me the fyn of his entente; Yet wiste I never wel what that he mente.’ 19 ‘What that I mene, O swete herte dere?’ Quod Troilus, ‘O goodly fresshe free! That, with the stremes of your eyen clere, Ye wolde som-tyme freendly on me see, And thanne agreën that I may ben he, With-oute braunche of vyce in any wyse, In trouthe alwey to doon yow my servyse 20 As to my lady right and chief resort, With al my wit and al my diligence, And I to han, right as yow list, comfort, Under your yerde, egal to myn offence, As deeth, if that I breke your defence; And that ye deigne me so muche honoure, Me to comaunden ought in any houre. 21 And I to ben your verray humble trewe, Secret, and in my paynes pacient, And ever-mo desire freshly newe, To serven, and been y-lyke ay diligent, And, with good herte, al holly your talent Receyven wel, how sore that me smerte, Lo, this mene I, myn owene swete herte.’ 22 Quod Pandarus, ‘lo, here an hard request, And resonable, a lady for to werne! Now, nece myn, by natal Ioves fest, Were I a god, ye sholde sterve as yerne, That heren wel, this man wol no-thing yerne But your honour, and seen him almost sterve, And been so looth to suffren him yow serve.’ 23 With that she gan hir eyen on him caste Ful esily, and ful debonairly, Avysing hir, and hyed not to faste With never a word, but seyde him softely, ‘Myn honour sauf, I wol wel trewely, And in swich forme as he can now devyse, Receyven him fully to my servyse, 24 Biseching him, for goddes love, that he Wolde, in honour of trouthe and gentilesse, As I wel mene, eek mene wel to me, And myn honour, with wit and besinesse, Ay kepe; and if I may don him gladnesse, From hennes-forth, y-wis, I nil not feyne: Now beeth al hool, no lenger ye ne pleyne. 25 But nathelees, this warne I yow,’ quod she, ‘A kinges sone al-though ye be, y-wis, Ye shul na-more have soverainetee Of me in love, than right in that cas is; Ne I nil forbere, if that ye doon a-mis, To wrathen yow; and whyl that ye me serve, Cherycen yow right after ye deserve. 26 And shortly, derë herte and al my knight, Beth glad, and draweth yow to lustinesse, And I shal trewely, with al my might, Your bittre tornen al in-to swetnesse; If I be she that may yow do gladnesse, For every wo ye shal recovere a blisse’; And him in armes took, and gan him kisse. 27 Fil Pandarus on knees, and up his yën To hevene threw, and held his hondes hye, ‘Immortal god!’ quod he, ‘that mayst nought dyen, Cupide I mene, of this mayst glorifye; And Venus, thou mayst make melodye; With-outen hond, me semeth that in towne, For this merveyle, I here ech belle sowne. 28 But ho! no more as now of this matere, For-why this folk wol comen up anoon, That han the lettre red; lo, I hem here. But I coniure thee, Criseyde, and oon, And two, thou Troilus, whan thow mayst goon, That at myn hous ye been at my warninge, For I ful wel shal shape your cominge; 29 And eseth ther your hertes right y-nough; And lat see which of yow shal bere the belle To speke of love a-right!’ ther-with he lough, ‘For ther have ye a layser for to telle.’ Quod Troilus, ‘how longe shal I dwelle Er this be doon?’ Quod he, ‘whan thou mayst ryse, This thing shal be right as I yow devyse.’ 30 With that Eleyne and also Deiphebus Tho comen upward, right at the steyres ende; And lord, so than gan grone Troilus, His brother and his suster for to blende. Quod Pandarus, ‘it tyme is that we wende; Tak, nece myn, your leve at alle three, And lat hem speke, and cometh forth with me.’ 31 She took hir leve at hem ful thriftily, As she wel coude, and they hir reverence Un-to the fulle diden hardely, And speken wonder wel, in hir absence, Of hir, in preysing of hir excellence, Hir governaunce, hir wit; and hir manere Commendeden, it Ioye was to here. 32 Now lat hir wende un-to hir owne place, And torne we to Troilus a-yein, That gan ful lightly of the lettre passe, That Deiphebus hadde in the gardin seyn. And of Eleyne and him he wolde fayn Delivered been, and seyde, that him leste To slepe, and after tales have reste. 33 Eleyne him kiste, and took hir leve blyve, Deiphebus eek, and hoom wente every wight; And Pandarus, as faste as he may dryve, To Troilus tho com, as lyne right; And on a paillet, al that glade night, By Troilus he lay, with mery chere, To tale; and wel was hem they were y-fere. 34 Whan every wight was voided but they two, And alle the dores were faste y-shette, To telle in short, with-oute wordes mo, This Pandarus, with-outen any lette, Up roos, and on his beddes syde him sette, And gan to speken in a sobre wyse To Troilus, as I shal yow devyse. 35 ‘Myn alderlevest lord, and brother dere, God woot, and thou, that it sat me so sore, When I thee saw so languisshing to-yere, For love, of which thy wo wex alwey more; That I, with al my might and al my lore, Have ever sithen doon my bisinesse To bringe thee to Ioye out of distresse; 36 And have it brought to swich plyt as thou wost, So that, thorugh me, thow stondest now in weye To fare wel, I seye it for no bost, And wostow why? for shame it is to seye, For thee have I bigonne a gamen pleye Which that I never doon shal eft for other, Al-though he were a thousand fold my brother. 37 That is to seye, for thee am I bicomen, Bitwixen game and ernest, swich a mene As maken wommen un-to men to comen; Al sey I nought, thou wost wel what I mene. For thee have I my nece, of vyces clene, So fully maad thy gentilesse triste, That al shal been right as thy-selve liste. 38 But god, that al wot, take I to witnesse, That never I this for coveityse wroughte, But only for to abregge that distresse, For which wel nygh thou deydest, as me thoughte. But gode brother, do now as thee oughte, For goddes love, and keep hir out of blame, Sin thou art wys, and save alwey hir name. 39 For wel thou wost, the name as yet of here Among the peple, as who seyth, halwed is; For that man is unbore, I dar wel swere, That ever wiste that she dide amis. But wo is me, that I, that cause al this, May thenken that she is my nece dere, And I hir eem, and traytor eek y-fere! 40 And were it wist that I, through myn engyn, Hadde in my nece y-put this fantasye, To do thy lust, and hoolly to be thyn, Why, al the world up-on it wolde crye, And seye, that I the worste trecherye Dide in this cas, that ever was bigonne, And she for-lost, and thou right nought y-wonne. 41 Wher-fore, er I wol ferther goon a pas, Yet eft I thee biseche and fully seye, That privetee go with us in this cas, That is to seye, that thou us never wreye; And be nought wrooth, though I thee ofte preye To holden secree swich an heigh matere; For skilful is, thow wost wel, my preyere. 42 And thenk what wo ther hath bitid er this, For makinge of avauntes, as men rede; And what mischaunce in this world yet ther is, Fro day to day, right for that wikked dede; For which these wyse clerkes that ben dede Han ever yet proverbed to us yonge, That “firste vertu is to kepe tonge.” 43 And, nere it that I wilne as now tabregge Diffusioun of speche, I coude almost A thousand olde stories thee alegge Of wommen lost, thorugh fals and foles bost; Proverbes canst thy-self y-nowe, and wost, Ayeins that vyce, for to been a labbe, Al seyde men sooth as often as they gabbe. 44 O tonge, allas! so often here-biforn Hastow made many a lady bright of hewe Seyd, “welawey! the day that I was born!” And many a maydes sorwes for to newe; And, for the more part, al is untrewe That men of yelpe, and it were brought to preve; Of kinde non avauntour is to leve. 45 Avauntour and a lyere, al is on; As thus: I pose, a womman graunte me Hir love, and seyth that other wol she non, And I am sworn to holden it secree, And after I go telle it two or three; Y-wis, I am avauntour at the leste, And lyere, for I breke my biheste. 46 Now loke thanne, if they be nought to blame, Swich maner folk; what shal I clepe hem, what, That hem avaunte of wommen, and by name, That never yet bihighte hem this ne that, Ne knewe hem more than myn olde hat? No wonder is, so god me sende hele, Though wommen drede with us men to dele. 47 I sey not this for no mistrust of yow, Ne for no wys man, but for foles nyce, And for the harm that in the world is now, As wel for foly ofte as for malyce; For wel wot I, in wyse folk, that vyce No womman drat, if she be wel avysed; For wyse ben by foles harm chastysed. 48 But now to purpos; leve brother dere, Have al this thing that I have seyd in minde, And keep thee clos, and be now of good chere, For at thy day thou shalt me trewe finde. I shal thy proces sette in swich a kinde, And god to-forn, that it shall thee suffyse, For it shal been right as thou wolt devyse. 49 For wel I woot, thou menest wel, parde; Therfore I dar this fully undertake. Thou wost eek what thy lady graunted thee, And day is set, the chartres up to make. Have now good night, I may no lenger wake; And bid for me, sin thou art now in blisse, That god me sende deeth or sone lisse.’ 50 Who mighte telle half the Ioye or feste Which that the sowle of Troilus tho felte, Heringe theffect of Pandarus biheste? His olde wo, that made his herte swelte, Gan tho for Ioye wasten and to-melte, And al the richesse of his sykes sore At ones fledde, he felte of hem no more. 51 But right so as these holtes and these hayes, That han in winter dede been and dreye, Revesten hem in grene, whan that May is, Whan every lusty lyketh best to pleye: Right in that selve wyse, sooth to seye, Wex sodeynliche his herte ful of Ioye, That gladder was ther never man in Troye. 52 And gan his look on Pandarus up caste Ful sobrely, and frendly for to see, And seyde, ‘freend, in Aprille the laste, As wel thou wost, if it remembre thee, How neigh the deeth for wo thou founde me; And how thou didest al thy bisinesse To knowe of me the cause of my distresse. 53 Thou wost how longe I it for-bar to seye To thee, that art the man that I best triste; And peril was it noon to thee by-wreye, That wiste I wel; but tel me, if thee liste, Sith I so looth was that thy-self it wiste, How dorste I mo tellen of this matere, That quake now, and no wight may us here? 54 But natheles, by that god I thee swere, That, as him list, may al this world governe, And, if I lye, Achilles with his spere Myn herte cleve, al were my lyf eterne, As I am mortal, if I late or yerne Wolde it biwreye, or dorste, or sholde conne, For al the good that god made under sonne; 55 That rather deye I wolde, and determyne, As thinketh me, now stokked in presoun, In wrecchednesse, in filthe, and in vermyne, Caytif to cruel king Agamenoun; And this, in alle the temples of this toun, Upon the goddes alle, I wol thee swere, To-morwe day, if that thee lyketh here. 56 And that thou hast so muche y-doon for me, That I ne may it never-more deserve, This knowe I wel, al mighte I now for thee A thousand tymes on a morwen sterve, I can no more, but that I wol thee serve Right as thy sclave, whider-so thou wende, For ever-more, un-to my lyves ende! 57 But here, with al myn herte, I thee biseche, That never in me thou deme swich folye As I shal seyn; me thoughte, by thy speche, That this, which thou me dost for companye, I sholde wene it were a bauderye; I am nought wood, al-if I lewed be; It is not so, that woot I wel, pardee. 58 But he that goth, for gold or for richesse, On swich message, calle him what thee list; And this that thou dost, calle it gentilesse, Compassioun, and felawship, and trist; Departe it so, for wyde-where is wist How that there is dyversitee requered Bitwixen thinges lyke, as I have lered. 59 And, that thou knowe I thenke nought ne wene That this servyse a shame be or Iape, I have my faire suster Polixene, Cassandre, Eleyne, or any of the frape; Be she never so faire or wel y-shape, Tel me, which thou wilt of everichone, To han for thyn, and lat me thanne allone. 60 But sin that thou hast don me this servyse, My lyf to save, and for noon hope of mede, So, for the love of god, this grete empryse Parforme it out; for now is moste nede. For high and low, with-outen any drede, I wol alwey thyne hestes alle kepe; Have now good night, and lat us bothe slepe.’ 61 Thus held him ech with other wel apayed, That al the world ne mighte it bet amende; And, on the morwe, whan they were arayed, Ech to his owene nedes gan entende. But Troilus, though as the fyr he brende For sharp desyr of hope and of plesaunce, He not for-gat his gode governaunce. 62 But in him-self with manhod gan restreyne Ech rakel dede and ech unbrydled chere, That alle tho that liven, sooth to seyne, Ne sholde han wist, by word or by manere, What that he mente, as touching this matere. From every wight as fer as is the cloude He was, so wel dissimulen he coude. 63 And al the whyl which that I yow devyse, This was his lyf; with al his fulle might, By day he was in Martes high servyse, This is to seyn, in armes as a knight; And for the more part, the longe night He lay, and thoughte how that he mighte serve His lady best, hir thank for to deserve. 64 Nil I nought swerë, al-though he lay softe, That in his thought he nas sumwhat disesed, Ne that he tornede on his pilwes ofte, And wolde of that him missed han ben sesed; But in swich cas man is nought alwey plesed, For ought I wot, no more than was he; That can I deme of possibilitee. 65 But certeyn is, to purpos for to go, That in this whyle, as writen is in geste, He say his lady som-tyme; and also She with him spak, whan that she dorste or leste, And by hir bothe avys, as was the beste, Apoynteden ful warly in this nede, So as they dorste, how they wolde procede. 66 But it was spoken in so short a wyse, In swich awayt alwey, and in swich fere, Lest any wyght divynen or devyse Wolde of hem two, or to it leye an ere, That al this world so leef to hem ne were As that Cupido wolde hem grace sende To maken of hir speche aright an ende. 67 But thilke litel that they speke or wroughte, His wyse goost took ay of al swich hede, It semed hir, he wiste what she thoughte With-outen word, so that it was no nede To bidde him ought to done, or ought for-bede; For which she thoughte that love, al come it late, Of alle Ioye hadde opned hir the yate. 68 And shortly of this proces for to pace, So wel his werk and wordes he bisette, That he so ful stood in his lady grace, That twenty thousand tymes, or she lette, She thonked god she ever with him mette; So coude he him governe in swich servyse, That al the world ne mighte it bet devyse. 69 For-why she fond him so discreet in al, So secret, and of swich obëisaunce, That wel she felte he was to hir a wal Of steel, and sheld from every displesaunce; That, to ben in his gode governaunce, So wys he was, she was no more afered, I mene, as fer as oughte ben requered. 70 And Pandarus, to quike alwey the fyr, Was ever y-lyke prest and diligent; To ese his frend was set al his desyr. He shof ay on, he to and fro was sent; He lettres bar whan Troilus was absent. That never man, as in his freendes nede, Ne bar him bet than he, with-outen drede. 71 But now, paraunter, som man wayten wolde That every word, or sonde, or look, or chere Of Troilus that I rehersen sholde, In al this whyle, un-to his lady dere; I trowe it were a long thing for to here; Or of what wight that stant in swich disioynte, His wordes alle, or every look, to poynte. 72 For sothe, I have not herd it doon er this, In storye noon, ne no man here, I wene; And though I wolde I coude not, y-wis; For ther was som epistel hem bitwene, That wolde, as seyth myn auctor, wel contene Neigh half this book, of which him list not wryte; How sholde I thanne a lyne of it endyte? 73 But to the grete effect: than sey I thus, That stonding in concord and in quiete Thise ilke two, Criseyde and Troilus, As I have told, and in this tyme swete, Save only often mighte they not mete, Ne layser have hir speches to fulfelle, That it befel right as I shal yow telle, 74 That Pandarus, that ever dide his might Right for the fyn that I shal speke of here, As for to bringe to his hous som night His faire nece, and Troilus y-fere, Wher-as at leyser al this heigh matere, Touching hir love, were at the fulle up-bounde, Hadde out of doute a tyme to it founde. 75 For he with greet deliberacioun Hadde every thing that her-to mighte avayle Forn-cast, and put in execucioun, And neither laft, for cost ne for travayle; Come if hem lest, hem sholde no-thing fayle; And for to been in ought espyed there, That, wiste he wel, an inpossible were. 76 Dredelees, it cleer was in the wind Of every pye and every lette-game; Now al is wel, for al the world is blind In this matere, bothe fremed and tame. This timber is al redy up to frame; Us lakketh nought but that we witen wolde A certein houre, in whiche she comen sholde. 77 And Troilus, that al this purveyaunce Knew at the fulle, and waytede on it ay, Hadde here-up-on eek made gret ordenaunce, And founde his cause, and ther-to his aray, If that he were missed, night or day, Ther-whyle he was aboute this servyse, That he was goon to doon his sacrifyse, 78 And moste at swich a temple alone wake, Answered of Appollo for to be; And first, to seen the holy laurer quake, Er that Apollo spak out of the tree, To telle him next whan Grekes sholden flee, And forthy lette him no man, god forbede, But preye Apollo helpen in this nede. 79 Now is ther litel more for to done, But Pandare up, and shortly for to seyne, Right sone upon the chaunging of the mone, Whan lightles is the world a night or tweyne, And that the welken shoop him for to reyne, He streight a-morwe un-to his nece wente; Ye han wel herd the fyn of his entente. 80 Whan he was come, he gan anoon to pleye As he was wont, and of him-self to Iape; And fynally, he swor and gan hir seye, By this and that, she sholde him not escape, Ne lengere doon him after hir to gape; But certeynly she moste, by hir leve, Come soupen in his hous with him at eve. 81 At whiche she lough, and gan hir faste excuse, And seyde, ‘it rayneth; lo, how sholde I goon?’ ‘Lat be,’ quod he, ‘ne stond not thus to muse; This moot be doon, ye shal be ther anoon.’ So at the laste her-of they felle at oon, Or elles, softe he swor hir in hir ere, He nolde never come ther she were. 82 Sone after this, to him she gan to rowne, And asked him if Troilus were there? He swor hir, ‘nay, for he was out of towne,’ And seyde, ‘nece, I pose that he were, Yow thurfte never have the more fere. For rather than men mighte him ther aspye, Me were lever a thousand-fold to dye.’ 83 Nought list myn auctor fully to declare What that she thoughte whan he seyde so, That Troilus was out of town y-fare, As if he seyde ther-of sooth or no; But that, with-oute awayt, with him to go, She graunted him, sith he hir that bisoughte, And, as his nece, obeyed as hir oughte. 84 But nathelees, yet gan she him biseche, Al-though with him to goon it was no fere, For to be war of goosish peples speche, That dremen thinges whiche that never were, And wel avyse him whom he broughte there; And seyde him, ‘eem, sin I mot on yow triste, Loke al be wel, and do now as yow liste.’ 85 He swor hir, ‘yis, by stokkes and by stones, And by the goddes that in hevene dwelle, Or elles were him lever, soule and bones, With Pluto king as depe been in helle As Tantalus!’ What sholde I more telle? Whan al was wel, he roos and took his leve, And she to souper com, whan it was eve, 86 With a certayn of hir owene men, And with hir faire nece Antigone, And othere of hir wommen nyne or ten; But who was glad now, who, as trowe ye, But Troilus, that stood and mighte it see Thurgh-out a litel windowe in a stewe, Ther he bishet, sin midnight, was in mewe, 87 Unwist of every wight but of Pandare? But to the poynt; now whan she was y-come With alle Ioye, and alle frendes fare, Hir eem anoon in armes hath hir nome, And after to the souper, alle and some, Whan tyme was, ful softe they hem sette; God wot, ther was no deyntee for to fette. 88 And after souper gonnen they to ryse, At ese wel, with hertes fresshe and glade, And wel was him that coude best devyse To lyken hir, or that hir laughen made. He song; she pleyde; he tolde tale of Wade. But at the laste, as every thing hath ende, She took hir leve, and nedes wolde wende. 89 But O, Fortune, executrice of wierdes, O influences of thise hevenes hye! Soth is, that, under god, ye ben our hierdes, Though to us bestes been the causes wrye. This mene I now, for she gan hoomward hye, But execut was al bisyde hir leve, At the goddes wil; for which she moste bleve. 90 The bente mone with hir hornes pale, Saturne, and Iove, in Cancro ioyned were, That swich a rayn from hevene gan avale, That every maner womman that was there Hadde of that smoky reyn a verray fere; At which Pandare tho lough, and seyde thenne, ‘Now were it tyme a lady to go henne! 91 But goode nece, if I mighte ever plese Yow any-thing, than prey I yow,’ quod he, ‘To doon myn herte as now so greet an ese As for to dwelle here al this night with me, For-why this is your owene hous, pardee. For, by my trouthe, I sey it nought a-game, To wende as now, it were to me a shame.’ 92 Criseyde, whiche that coude as muche good As half a world, tok hede of his preyere; And sin it ron, and al was on a flood, She thoughte, as good chep may I dwellen here, And graunte it gladly with a freendes chere, And have a thank, as grucche and thanne abyde; For hoom to goon it may nought wel bityde. 93 ‘I wol,’ quod she, ‘myn uncle leef and dere, Sin that yow list, it skile is to be so; I am right glad with yow to dwellen here; I seyde but a-game, I wolde go.’ ‘Y-wis, graunt mercy, nece!’ quod he tho; ‘Were it a game or no, soth for to telle, Now am I glad, sin that yow list to dwelle.’ 94 Thus al is wel; but tho bigan aright The newe Ioye, and al the feste agayn; But Pandarus, if goodly hadde he might, He wolde han hyed hir to bedde fayn, And seyde, ‘lord, this is an huge rayn! This were a weder for to slepen inne; And that I rede us sone to biginne. 95 And nece, woot ye wher I wol yow leye, For that we shul not liggen fer asonder, And for ye neither shullen, dar I seye, Heren noise of reynes nor of thondre? By god, right in my lyte closet yonder. And I wol in that outer hous allone Be wardeyn of your wommen everichone. 96 And in this middel chaumbre that ye see Shul youre wommen slepen wel and softe; And ther I seyde shal your-selve be; And if ye liggen wel to-night, com ofte, And careth not what weder is on-lofte. The wyn anon, and whan so that yow leste, So go we slepe, I trowe it be the beste.’ 97 Ther nis no more, but here-after sone, The voydè dronke, and travers drawe anon, Gan every wight, that hadde nought to done More in that place, out of the chaumber gon. And ever-mo so sternelich it ron, And blew ther-with so wonderliche loude, That wel neigh no man heren other coude. 98 Tho Pandarus, hir eem, right as him oughte, With women swiche as were hir most aboute, Ful glad un-to hir beddes syde hir broughte, And toke his leve, and gan ful lowe loute, And seyde, ‘here at this closet-dore with-oute, Right over-thwart, your wommen liggen alle, That, whom yow liste of hem, ye may here calle.’ 99 So whan that she was in the closet leyd, And alle hir wommen forth by ordenaunce A-bedde weren, ther as I have seyd, There was no more to skippen nor to traunce, But boden go to bedde, with mischaunce, If any wight was steringe any-where, And late hem slepe that a-bedde were. 100 But Pandarus, that wel coude eche a del The olde daunce, and every poynt ther-inne, Whan that he sey that alle thing was wel, He thoughte he wolde up-on his werk biginne, And gan the stewe-dore al softe un-pinne, And stille as stoon, with-outen lenger lette, By Troilus a-doun right he him sette. 101 And, shortly to the poynt right for to gon, Of al this werk he tolde him word and ende, And seyde, ‘make thee redy right anon, For thou shalt in-to hevene blisse wende.’ ‘Now blisful Venus, thou me grace sende,’ Quod Troilus, ‘for never yet no nede Hadde I er now, ne halvendel the drede.’ 102 Quod Pandarus, ‘ne drede thee never a del, For it shal been right as thou wilt desyre; So thryve I, this night shal I make it wel, Or casten al the gruwel in the fyre.’ ‘Yit blisful Venus, this night thou me enspyre,’ Quod Troilus, ‘as wis as I thee serve, And ever bet and bet shal, til I sterve. 103 And if I hadde, O Venus ful of murthe, Aspectes badde of Mars or of Saturne, Or thou combust or let were in my birthe, Thy fader prey al thilke harm disturne Of grace, and that I glad ayein may turne, For love of him thou lovedest in the shawe, I mene Adoon, that with the boor was slawe. 104 O Iove eek, for the love of faire Europe, The whiche in forme of bole away thou fette; Now help, O Mars, thou with thy blody cope, For love of Cipris, thou me nought ne lette; O Phebus, thenk whan Dane hir-selven shette Under the bark, and laurer wex for drede, Yet for hir love, O help now at this nede! 105 Mercurie, for the love of Hiersè eke, For which Pallas was with Aglauros wrooth, Now help, and eek Diane, I thee biseke, That this viage be not to thee looth. O fatal sustren, which, er any clooth Me shapen was, my destenè me sponne, So helpeth to this werk that is bi-gonne!’ 106 Quod Pandarus, ‘thou wrecched mouses herte, Art thou agast so that she wol thee byte? Why, don this furred cloke up-on thy sherte, And folowe me, for I wol han the wyte; But byd, and lat me go bifore a lyte.’ And with that word he gan un-do a trappe, And Troilus he broughte in by the lappe. 107 The sterne wind so loude gan to route That no wight other noyse mighte here; And they that layen at the dore with-oute, Ful sykerly they slepten alle y-fere; And Pandarus, with a ful sobre chere, Goth to the dore anon with-outen lette, Ther-as they laye, and softely it shette. 108 And as he com ayeinward prively, His nece awook, and asked ‘who goth there?’ ‘My dere nece,’ quod he, ‘it am I; Ne wondreth not, ne have of it no fere;’ And ner he com, and seyde hir in hir ere, ‘No word, for love of god I yow biseche; Lat no wight ryse and heren of our speche.’ 109 ‘What! which wey be ye comen, benedicite?’ Quod she, ‘and how thus unwist of hem alle?’ ‘Here at this secre trappe-dore,’ quod he. Quod tho Criseyde, ‘lat me som wight calle.’ ‘Ey! god forbede that it sholde falle,’ Quod Pandarus, ‘that ye swich foly wroughte! They mighte deme thing they never er thoughte! 110 It is nought good a sleping hound to wake, Ne yeve a wight a cause to devyne; Your wommen slepen alle, I under-take, So that, for hem, the hous men mighte myne; And slepen wolen til the sonne shyne. And whan my tale al brought is to an ende, Unwist, right as I com, so wol I wende. 111 Now nece myn, ye shul wel understonde,’ Quod he, ‘so as ye wommen demen alle, That for to holde in love a man in honde, And him hir “leef” and “dere herte” calle, And maken him an howve above a calle, I mene, as love an other in this whyle, She doth hir-self a shame, and him a gyle. 112 Now wherby that I telle yow al this? Ye woot your-self, as wel as any wight, How that your love al fully graunted is To Troilus, the worthieste knight, Oon of this world, and ther-to trouthe plyght, That, but it were on him along, ye nolde Him never falsen, whyl ye liven sholde. 113 Now stant it thus, that sith I fro yow wente, This Troilus, right platly for to seyn, Is thurgh a goter, by a privè wente, In-to my chaumbre come in al this reyn, Unwist of every maner wight, certeyn, Save of my-self, as wisly have I Ioye, And by that feith I shal Pryam of Troye! 114 And he is come in swich peyne and distresse That, but he be al fully wood by this, He sodeynly mot falle in-to wodnesse, But-if god helpe; and cause why this is, He seyth him told is, of a freend of his, How that ye sholde love oon that hatte Horaste, For sorwe of which this night shalt been his laste.’ 115 Criseyde, which that al this wonder herde, Gan sodeynly aboute hir herte colde, And with a syk she sorwfully answerde, ‘Allas! I wende, who-so tales tolde, My dere herte wolde me not holde So lightly fals! allas! conceytes wronge, What harm they doon, for now live I to longe! 116 Horaste! allas! and falsen Troilus? I knowe him not, god helpe me so,’ quod she; ‘Allas! what wikked spirit tolde him thus? Now certes, eem, to-morwe, and I him see, I shal ther-of as ful excusen me As ever dide womman, if him lyke’; And with that word she gan ful sore syke. 117 ‘O god!’ quod she, ‘so worldly selinesse, Which clerkes callen fals felicitee, Y-medled is with many a bitternesse! Ful anguisshous than is, god woot,’ quod she, ‘Condicioun of veyn prosperitee; For either Ioyes comen nought y-fere, Or elles no wight hath hem alwey here. 118 O brotel wele of mannes Ioye unstable! With what wight so thou be, or how thou pleye, Either he woot that thou, Ioye, art muable, Or woot it not, it moot ben oon of tweye; Now if he woot it not, how may he seye That he hath verray Ioye and selinesse, That is of ignoraunce ay in derknesse? 119 Now if he woot that Ioye is transitorie, As every Ioye of worldly thing mot flee, Than every tyme he that hath in memorie, The drede of lesing maketh him that he May in no parfit selinesse be. And if to lese his Ioye he set a myte, Than semeth it that Ioye is worth ful lyte. 120 Wherfore I wol deffyne in this matere, That trewely, for ought I can espye, Ther is no verray wele in this world here. But O, thou wikked serpent Ialousye, Thou misbeleved and envious folye, Why hastow Troilus me mad untriste, That never yet agilte him, that I wiste?’ 121 Quod Pandarus, ‘thus fallen is this cas.’ ‘Why, uncle myn,’ quod she, ‘who tolde him this? Why doth my dere herte thus, allas?’ ‘Ye woot, ye nece myn,’ quod he, ‘what is; I hope al shal be wel that is amis. For ye may quenche al this, if that yow leste, And doth right so, for I holde it the beste.’ 122 ‘So shal I do to-morwe, y-wis,’ quod she, ‘And god to-forn, so that it shal suffyse.’ ‘To-morwe? allas, that were a fayr,’ quod he, ‘Nay, nay, it may not stonden in this wyse; For, nece myn, thus wryten clerkes wyse, That peril is with drecching in y-drawe; Nay, swich abodes been nought worth an hawe. 123 Nece, al thing hath tyme, I dar avowe; For whan a chaumber a-fyr is, or an halle, Wel more nede is, it sodeynly rescowe Than to dispute, and axe amonges alle How is this candele in the straw y-falle? A! benedicite! for al among that fare The harm is doon, and fare-wel feldefare! 124 And, nece myn, ne take it not a-greef, If that ye suffre him al night in this wo, God help me so, ye hadde him never leef, That dar I seyn, now there is but we two; But wel I woot, that ye wol not do so; Ye been to wys to do so gret folye, To putte his lyf al night in Iupartye.’ 125 ‘Hadde I him never leef? By god, I wene Ye hadde never thing so leef,’ quod she. ‘Now by my thrift,’ quod he, ‘that shal be sene; For, sin ye make this ensample of me, If I al night wolde him in sorwe see For al the tresour in the toun of Troye, I bidde god, I never mote have Ioye! 126 Now loke thanne, if ye, that been his love, Shul putte al night his lyf in Iupartye For thing of nought! Now, by that god above, Nought only this delay comth of folye, But of malyce, if that I shal nought lye. What, platly, and ye suffre him in distresse, Ye neither bountee doon ne gentilesse!’ 127 Quod tho Criseyde, ‘wole ye doon o thing, And ye therwith shal stinte al his disese; Have here, and bereth him this blewe ringe, For ther is no-thing mighte him bettre plese, Save I my-self, ne more his herte apese; And sey my dere herte, that his sorwe Is causeles, that shal be seen to-morwe.’ 128 ‘A ring?’ quod he, ‘ye, hasel-wodes shaken! Ye, nece myn, that ring moste han a stoon That mighte dede men alyve maken; And swich a ring, trowe I that ye have noon. Discrecioun out of your heed is goon; That fele I now,’ quod he, ‘and that is routhe; O tyme y-lost, wel maystow cursen slouthe! 129 Wot ye not wel that noble and heigh corage Ne sorweth not, ne stinteth eek for lyte? But if a fool were in a Ialous rage, I nolde setten at his sorwe a myte, But feffe him with a fewe wordes whyte Another day, whan that I mighte him finde: But this thing stont al in another kinde. 130 This is so gentil and so tendre of herte, That with his deeth he wol his sorwes wreke; For trusteth wel, how sore that him smerte, He wol to yow no Ialouse wordes speke. And for-thy, nece, er that his herte breke, So spek your-self to him of this matere; For with o word ye may his herte stere. 131 Now have I told what peril he is inne, And his coming unwist is to every wight; Ne, pardee, harm may ther be noon ne sinne; I wol my-self be with yow al this night. Ye knowe eek how it is your owne knight, And that, by right, ye moste upon him triste, And I al prest to fecche him whan yow liste.’ 132 This accident so pitous was to here, And eek so lyk a sooth, at pryme face, And Troilus hir knight to hir so dere, His privè coming, and the siker place, That, though that she dide him as thanne a grace, Considered alle thinges as they stode, No wonder is, sin she dide al for gode. 133 Cryseyde answerde, ‘as wisly god at reste My sowle bringe, as me is for him wo! And eem, y-wis, fayn wolde I doon the beste, If that I hadde grace to do so. But whether that ye dwelle or for him go, I am, til god me bettre minde sende, At dulcarnon, right at my wittes ende.’ 134 Quod Pandarus, ‘ye, nece, wol ye here? Dulcarnon called is “fleminge of wrecches”; It semeth hard, for wrecches wol not lere For verray slouthe or othere wilful tecches; This seyd by hem that be not worth two fecches. But ye ben wys, and that we han on honde Nis neither hard, ne skilful to withstonde.’ 135 ‘Thanne, eem,’ quod she, ‘doth her-of as yow list; But er he come I wil up first aryse; And, for the love of god, sin al my trist Is on yow two, and ye ben bothe wyse, So wircheth now in so discreet a wyse, That I honour may have, and he plesaunce; For I am here al in your governaunce.’ 136 ‘That is wel seyd,’ quod he, ‘my nece dere, Ther good thrift on that wyse gentil herte! But liggeth stille, and taketh him right here, It nedeth not no ferther for him sterte; And ech of yow ese otheres sorwes smerte, For love of god; and, Venus, I thee herie; For sone hope I we shulle ben alle merie.’ 137 This Troilus ful sone on knees him sette Ful sobrely, right by hir beddes heed, And in his beste wyse his lady grette; But lord, so she wex sodeynliche reed! Ne, though men sholden smyten of hir heed, She coude nought a word a-right out-bringe So sodeynly, for his sodeyn cominge. 138 But Pandarus, that so wel coude fele In every thing, to pleye anoon bigan, And seyde, ‘nece, see how this lord can knele! Now, for your trouthe, seeth this gentil man!’ And with that word he for a quisshen ran, And seyde, ‘kneleth now, whyl that yow leste, Ther god your hertes bringe sone at reste!’ 139 Can I not seyn, for she bad him not ryse, If sorwe it putte out of hir remembraunce, Or elles if she toke it in the wyse Of duëtee, as for his observaunce; But wel finde I she dide him this plesaunce, That she him kiste, al-though she syked sore; And bad him sitte a-doun with-outen more. 140 Quod Pandarus, ‘now wol ye wel biginne; Now doth him sitte, gode nece dere, Upon your beddes syde al there with-inne, That ech of yow the bet may other here.’ And with that word he drow him to the fere, And took a light, and fond his contenaunce As for to loke up-on an old romaunce. 141 Criseyde, that was Troilus lady right, And cleer stood on a ground of sikernesse, Al thoughte she, hir servaunt and hir knight Ne sholde of right non untrouthe in hir gesse, Yet nathelees, considered his distresse, And that love is in cause of swich folye, Thus to him spak she of his Ielousye: 142 ‘Lo, herte myn, as wolde the excellence Of love, ayeins the which that no man may, Ne oughte eek goodly maken resistence; And eek bycause I felte wel and say Your grete trouthe, and servyse every day; And that your herte al myn was, sooth to seyne, This droof me for to rewe up-on your peyne. 143 And your goodnesse have I founde alwey yit, Of whiche, my dere herte and al my knight, I thonke it yow, as fer as I have wit, Al can I nought as muche as it were right; And I, emforth my conninge and my might, Have and ay shal, how sore that me smerte, Ben to yow trewe and hool, with al myn herte; 144 And dredelees, that shal be founde at preve.— But, herte myn, what al this is to seyne Shal wel be told, so that ye noght yow greve, Though I to yow right on your-self compleyne. For ther-with mene I fynally the peyne, That halt your herte and myn in hevinesse, Fully to sleen, and every wrong redresse. 145 My goode, myn, not I for-why ne how That Ialousye, allas! that wikked wivere, Thus causelees is cropen in-to yow; The harm of which I wolde fayn delivere! Allas! that he, al hool, or of him slivere, Shuld have his refut in so digne a place, Ther Iove him sone out of your herte arace! 146 But O, thou Iove, O auctor of nature, Is this an honour to thy deitee, That folk ungiltif suffren here iniure, And who that giltif is, al quit goth he? O were it leful for to pleyne on thee, That undeserved suffrest Ialousye, And that I wolde up-on thee pleyne and crye! 147 Eek al my wo is this, that folk now usen To seyn right thus, “ye, Ialousye is love!” And wolde a busshel venim al excusen, For that o greyn of love is on it shove! But that wot heighe god that sit above, If it be lyker love, or hate, or grame; And after that, it oughte bere his name. 148 But certeyn is, som maner Ialousye Is excusable more than som, y-wis. As whan cause is, and som swich fantasye With pietee so wel repressed is, That it unnethe dooth or seyth amis, But goodly drinketh up al his distresse; And that excuse I, for the gentilesse. 149 And som so ful of furie is and despyt, That it sourmounteth his repressioun; But herte myn, ye be not in that plyt, That thanke I god, for whiche your passioun I wol not calle it but illusioun, Of habundaunce of love and bisy cure, That dooth your herte this disese endure. 150 Of which I am right sory, but not wrooth; But, for my devoir and your hertes reste, Wher-so yow list, by ordal or by ooth, By sort, or in what wyse so yow leste, For love of god, lat preve it for the beste! And if that I be giltif, do me deye, Allas! what mighte I more doon or seye?’ 151 With that a fewe brighte teres newe Out of hir eyen fille, and thus she seyde, ‘Now god, thou wost, in thought ne dede untrewe To Troilus was never yet Criseyde.’ With that hir heed doun in the bed she leyde, And with the shete it wreigh, and syghed sore, And held hir pees; not o word spak she more. 152 But now help god to quenchen al this sorwe, So hope I that he shal, for he best may; For I have seyn, of a ful misty morwe Folwen ful ofte a mery someres day; And after winter folweth grene May. Men seen alday, and reden eek in stories, That after sharpe shoures been victories. 153 This Troilus, whan he hir wordes herde, Have ye no care, him liste not to slepe; For it thoughte him no strokes of a yerde To here or seen Criseyde his lady wepe; But wel he felte aboute his herte crepe, For every teer which that Criseyde asterte, The crampe of deeth, to streyne him by the herte. 154 And in his minde he gan the tyme acurse That he cam therë, and that he was born; For now is wikke y-turned in-to worse, And al that labour he hath doon biforn, He wende it lost, he thoughte he nas but lorn. ‘O Pandarus,’ thoughte he, ‘allas! thy wyle Serveth of nought, so weylawey the whyle!’ 155 And therwithal he heng a-doun the heed, And fil on knees, and sorwfully he sighte; What mighte he seyn? he felte he nas but deed, For wrooth was she that shulde his sorwes lighte. But nathelees, whan that he speken mighte, Than seyde he thus, ‘god woot, that of this game, Whan al is wist, than am I not to blame!’ 156 Ther-with the sorwe so his herte shette, That from his eyen fil ther not a tere, And every spirit his vigour in-knette, So they astoned and oppressed were. The feling of his sorwe, or of his fere, Or of ought elles, fled was out of towne; And doun he fel al sodeynly a-swowne. 157 This was no litel sorwe for to see; But al was hust, and Pandare up as faste, ‘O nece, pees, or we be lost,’ quod he, Beth nought agast;’ but certeyn, at the laste, For this or that, he in-to bedde him caste, And seyde, ‘O theef, is this a mannes herte?’ And of he rente al to his bare sherte; 158 And seyde, ‘nece, but ye helpe us now, Allas, your owne Troilus is lorn!’ ‘Y-wis, so wolde I, and I wiste how, Ful fayn,’ quod she; ‘allas! that I was born!’ ‘Ye, nece, wol ye pullen out the thorn That stiketh in his herte?’ quod Pandare; ‘Sey “al foryeve,” and stint is al this fare!’ 159 ‘Ye, that to me,’ quod she, ‘ful lever were Than al the good the sonne aboute gooth’; And therwith-al she swoor him in his ere, ‘Y-wis, my dere herte, I am nought wrooth, Have here my trouthe and many another ooth; Now speek to me, for it am I, Cryseyde!’ But al for nought; yet mighte he not a-breyde. 160 Therwith his pous and pawmes of his hondes They gan to frote, and wete his temples tweyne, And, to deliveren him from bittre bondes, She ofte him kiste; and, shortly for to seyne, Him to revoken she dide al hir peyne. And at the laste, he gan his breeth to drawe, And of his swough sone after that adawe, 161 And gan bet minde and reson to him take, But wonder sore he was abayst, y-wis. And with a syk, whan he gan bet a-wake, He seyde, ‘O mercy, god, what thing is this?’ ‘Why do ye with your-selven thus amis?’ Quod tho Criseyde, ‘is this a mannes game? What, Troilus! wol ye do thus, for shame?’ 162 And therwith-al hir arm over him she leyde, And al foryaf, and ofte tyme him keste. He thonked hir, and to hir spak, and seyde As fil to purpos for his herte reste. And she to that answerde him as hir leste; And with hir goodly wordes him disporte She gan, and ofte his sorwes to comforte. 163 Quod Pandarus, ‘for ought I can espyen, This light nor I ne serven here of nought; Light is not good for syke folkes yën. But for the love of god, sin ye be brought In thus good plyt, lat now non hevy thought Ben hanginge in the hertes of yow tweye:’ And bar the candele to the chimeneye. 164 Sone after this, though it no nede were, Whan she swich othes as hir list devyse Hadde of him take, hir thoughte tho no fere, Ne cause eek non, to bidde him thennes ryse. Yet lesse thing than othes may suffyse In many a cas; for every wight, I gesse, That loveth wel meneth but gentilesse. 165 But in effect she wolde wite anoon Of what man, and eek where, and also why He Ielous was, sin ther was cause noon; And eek the signe, that he took it by, She bad him that to telle hir bisily, Or elles, certeyn, she bar him on honde, That this was doon of malis, hir to fonde. 166 With-outen more, shortly for to seyne, He moste obeye un-to his lady heste; And for the lasse harm, he moste feyne. He seyde hir, whan she was at swiche a feste She mighte on him han loked at the leste; Not I not what, al dere y-nough a risshe, As he that nedes moste a cause fisshe. 167 And she answerde, ‘swete, al were it so, What harm was that, sin I non yvel mene? For, by that god that boughte us bothe two, In alle thinge is myn entente clene. Swich arguments ne been not worth a bene; Wol ye the childish Ialous contrefete? Now were it worthy that ye were y-bete.’ 168 Tho Troilus gan sorwfully to syke, Lest she be wrooth, him thoughte his herte deyde; And seyde, ‘allas! upon my sorwes syke Have mercy, swete herte myn, Cryseyde! And if that, in tho wordes that I seyde, Be any wrong, I wol no more trespace; Do what yow list, I am al in your grace.’ 169 And she answerde, ‘of gilt misericorde! That is to seyn, that I foryeve al this; And ever-more on this night yow recorde, And beth wel war ye do no more amis.’ ‘Nay, dere herte myn,’ quod he, ‘y-wis.’ ‘And now,’ quod she, ‘that I have do yow smerte, Foryeve it me, myn owene swete herte.’ 170 This Troilus, with blisse of that supprysed, Put al in goddes hond, as he that mente No-thing but wel; and, sodeynly avysed, He hir in armes faste to him hente. And Pandarus, with a ful good entente, Leyde him to slepe, and seyde, ‘if ye ben wyse, Swowneth not now, lest more folk aryse.’ 171 What mighte or may the sely larke seye, Whan that the sparhauk hath it in his foot? I can no more, but of thise ilke tweye, To whom this tale sucre be or soot, Though that I tarie a yeer, som-tyme I moot, After myn auctor, tellen hir gladnesse, As wel as I have told hir hevinesse. 172 Criseyde, which that felte hir thus y-take, As writen clerkes in hir bokes olde, Right as an aspes leef she gan to quake, Whan she him felte hir in his armes folde. But Troilus, al hool of cares colde, Gan thanken tho the blisful goddes sevene; Thus sondry peynes bringen folk to hevene. 173 This Troilus in armes gan hir streyne, And seyde, ‘O swete, as ever mote I goon, Now be ye caught, now is ther but we tweyne; Now yeldeth yow, for other boot is noon.’ To that Criseyde answerde thus anoon, ‘Ne hadde I er now, my swete herte dere, Ben yolde, y-wis, I were now not here!’ 174 O! sooth is seyd, that heled for to be As of a fevre or othere greet syknesse, Men moste drinke, as men may often see, Ful bittre drink; and for to han gladnesse, Men drinken often peyne and greet distresse; I mene it here, as for this aventure, That thourgh a peyne hath founden al his cure. 175 And now swetnesse semeth more sweet, That bitternesse assayed was biforn; For out of wo in blisse now they flete. Non swich they felten, sith they were born; Now is this bet, than bothe two be lorn! For love of god, take every womman hede To werken thus, if it comth to the nede. 176 Criseyde, al quit from every drede and tene, As she that iuste cause hadde him to triste, Made him swich feste, it Ioye was to sene, Whan she his trouthe and clene entente wiste. And as aboute a tree, with many a twiste, Bitrent and wryth the sote wode-binde, Gan eche of hem in armes other winde. 177 And as the newe abaysshed nightingale, That stinteth first whan she biginneth singe, Whan that she hereth any herde tale, Or in the hegges any wight steringe, And after siker dooth hir voys out-ringe; Right so Criseyde, whan hir drede stente, Opned hir herte, and tolde him hir entente. 178 And right as he that seeth his deeth y-shapen, And deye moot, in ought that he may gesse, And sodeynly rescous doth him escapen, And from his deeth is brought in sikernesse, For al this world, in swich present gladnesse Was Troilus, and hath his lady swete; With worse hap god lat us never mete! 179 Hir armes smale, hir streyghte bak and softe, Hir sydes longe, fleshly, smothe, and whyte He gan to stroke, and good thrift bad ful ofte Hir snowish throte, hir brestes rounde and lyte; Thus in this hevene he gan him to delyte, And ther-with-al a thousand tyme hir kiste; That, what to done, for Ioye unnethe he wiste. 180 Than seyde he thus, ‘O, Love, O, Charitee, Thy moder eek, Citherea the swete, After thy-self next heried be she, Venus mene I, the wel-willy planete; And next that, Imenëus, I thee grete; For never man was to yow goddes holde As I, which ye han brought fro cares colde. 181 Benigne Love, thou holy bond of thinges, Who-so wol grace, and list thee nought honouren, Lo, his desyr wol flee with-outen winges. For, noldestow of bountee hem socouren That serven best and most alwey labouren, Yet were al lost, that dar I wel seyn, certes, But-if thy grace passed our desertes. 182 And for thou me, that coude leest deserve Of hem that nombred been un-to thy grace, Hast holpen, ther I lykly was to sterve, And me bistowed in so heygh a place That thilke boundes may no blisse pace, I can no more, but laude and reverence Be to thy bounte and thyn excellence!’ 183 And therwith-al Criseyde anoon he kiste, Of which, certeyn, she felte no disese. And thus seyde he, ‘now wolde god I wiste, Myn herte swete, how I yow mighte plese! What man,’ quod he, ‘was ever thus at ese As I, on whiche the faireste and the beste That ever I say, deyneth hir herte reste. 184 Here may men seen that mercy passeth right; The experience of that is felt in me, That am unworthy to so swete a wight. But herte myn, of your benignitee, So thenketh, though that I unworthy be, Yet mot I nede amenden in som wyse, Right thourgh the vertu of your heyghe servyse. 185 And for the love of god, my lady dere, Sin god hath wrought me for I shal yow serve, As thus I mene, that ye wol be my stere, To do me live, if that yow liste, or sterve, So techeth me how that I may deserve Your thank, so that I, thurgh myn ignoraunce, Ne do no-thing that yow be displesaunce. 186 For certes, fresshe wommanliche wyf, This dar I seye, that trouthe and diligence, That shal ye finden in me al my lyf, Ne I wol not, certeyn, breken your defence; And if I do, present or in absence, For love of god, lat slee me with the dede, If that it lyke un-to your womanhede.’ 187 ‘Y-wis,’ quod she, ‘myn owne hertes list, My ground of ese, and al myn herte dere, Graunt mercy, for on that is al my trist; But late us falle awey fro this matere; For it suffyseth, this that seyd is here. And at o word, with-outen repentaunce, Wel-come, my knight, my pees, my suffisaunce!’ 188 Of hir delyt, or Ioyes oon the leste Were impossible to my wit to seye; But iuggeth, ye that han ben at the feste Of swich gladnesse, if that hem liste pleye! I can no more, but thus thise ilke tweye That night, be-twixen dreed and sikernesse, Felten in love the grete worthinesse. 189 O blisful night, of hem so longe y-sought, How blithe un-to hem bothe two thou were! Why ne hadde I swich on with my soule y-bought, Ye, or the leeste Ioye that was there? A-wey, thou foule daunger and thou fere, And lat hem in this hevene blisse dwelle, That is so heygh, that al ne can I telle! 190 But sooth is, though I can not tellen al, As can myn auctor, of his excellence, Yet have I seyd, and, god to-forn, I shal In every thing al hoolly his sentence. And if that I, at loves reverence, Have any word in eched for the beste, Doth therwith-al right as your-selven leste. 191 For myne wordes, here and every part, I speke hem alle under correccioun Of yow, that feling han in loves art, And putte it al in your discrecioun To encrese or maken diminucioun Of my langage, and that I yow bi-seche; But now to purpos of my rather speche. 192 Thise ilke two, that ben in armes laft, So looth to hem a-sonder goon it were, That ech from other wende been biraft, Or elles, lo, this was hir moste fere, That al this thing but nyce dremes were; For which ful ofte ech of hem seyde, ‘O swete, Clippe ich yow thus, or elles I it mete?’ 193 And, lord! so he gan goodly on hir see, That never his look ne bleynte from hir face, And seyde, ‘O dere herte, may it be That it be sooth, that ye ben in this place?’ ‘Ye, herte myn, god thank I of his grace!’ Quod tho Criseyde, and therwith-al him kiste, That where his spirit was, for Ioye he niste. 194 This Troilus ful ofte hir eyen two Gan for to kisse, and seyde, ‘O eyen clere, It were ye that wroughte me swich wo, Ye humble nettes of my lady dere! Though ther be mercy writen in your chere, God wot, the text ful hard is, sooth, to finde, How coude ye with-outen bond me binde?’ 195 Therwith he gan hir faste in armes take, And wel an hundred tymes gan he syke, Nought swiche sorwful sykes as men make For wo, or elles whan that folk ben syke, But esy sykes, swiche as been to lyke, That shewed his affeccioun with-inne; Of swiche sykes coude he nought bilinne. 196 Sone after this they speke of sondry thinges, As fil to purpos of this aventure, And pleyinge entrechaungeden hir ringes, Of which I can nought tellen no scripture; But wel I woot a broche, gold and asure, In whiche a ruby set was lyk an herte, Criseyde him yaf, and stak it on his sherte. 197 Lord! trowe ye, a coveitous, a wrecche, That blameth love and holt of it despyt, That, of tho pens that he can mokre and kecche, Was ever yet y-yeve him swich delyt, As is in love, in oo poynt, in som plyt? Nay, doutelees, for also god me save, So parfit Ioye may no nigard have! 198 They wol sey ‘yis,’ but lord! so that they lye, Tho bisy wrecches, ful of wo and drede! They callen love a woodnesse or folye, But it shal falle hem as I shal yow rede; They shul forgo the whyte and eke the rede, And live in wo, ther god yeve hem mischaunce, And every lover in his trouthe avaunce! 199 As wolde god, tho wrecches, that dispyse Servyse of love, hadde eres al-so longe As hadde Myda, ful of coveityse; And ther-to dronken hadde as hoot and stronge As Crassus dide for his affectis wronge, To techen hem that they ben in the vyce, And loveres nought, al-though they holde hem nyce! 200 Thise ilke two, of whom that I yow seye, Whan that hir hertes wel assured were, Tho gonne they to speken and to pleye, And eek rehercen how, and whanne, and where, They knewe hem first, and every wo and fere That passed was; but al swich hevinesse, I thanke it god, was tourned to gladnesse. 201 And ever-mo, whan that hem fel to speke Of any thing of swich a tyme agoon, With kissing al that tale sholde breke, And fallen in a newe Ioye anoon, And diden al hir might, sin they were oon, For to recoveren blisse and been at ese, And passed wo with Ioye countrepeyse. 202 Reson wil not that I speke of sleep, For it accordeth nought to my matere; God woot, they toke of that ful litel keep, But lest this night, that was to hem so dere, Ne sholde in veyn escape in no manere, It was biset in Ioye and bisinesse Of al that souneth in-to gentilnesse. 203 But whan the cok, comune astrologer, Gan on his brest to bete, and after crowe, And Lucifer, the dayes messager, Gan for to ryse, and out hir bemes throwe; And estward roos, to him that coude it knowe, Fortuna maior, [than] anoon Criseyde, With herte sore, to Troilus thus seyde:— 204 ‘Myn hertes lyf, my trist and my plesaunce, That I was born, allas! what me is wo, That day of us mot make desseveraunce! For tyme it is to ryse, and hennes go, Or elles I am lost for evermo! O night, allas! why niltow over us hove, As longe as whanne Almena lay by Iove? 205 O blake night, as folk in bokes rede, That shapen art by god this world to hyde At certeyn tymes with thy derke wede, That under that men mighte in reste abyde, Wel oughte bestes pleyne, and folk thee chyde, That there-as day with labour wolde us breste, That thou thus fleest, and deynest us nought reste! 206 Thou dost, allas! to shortly thyn offyce, Thou rakel night, ther god, makere of kinde, Thee, for thyn hast and thyn unkinde vyce, So faste ay to our hemi-spere binde, That never-more under the ground thou winde! For now, for thou so hyest out of Troye, Have I forgon thus hastily my Ioye!’ 207 This Troilus, that with tho wordes felte, As thoughte him tho, for pietous distresse, The blody teres from his herte melte, As he that never yet swich hevinesse Assayed hadde, out of so greet gladnesse, Gan therwith-al Criseyde his lady dere In armes streyne, and seyde in this manere:— 208 ‘O cruel day, accusour of the Ioye That night and love han stole and faste y-wryen, A-cursed be thy coming in-to Troye, For every bore hath oon of thy bright yën! Envyous day, what list thee so to spyen? What hastow lost, why sekestow this place, Ther god thy lyght so quenche, for his grace? 209 Allas! what han thise loveres thee agilt, Dispitous day? thyn be the pyne of helle! For many a lovere hastow shent, and wilt; Thy pouring in wol no-wher lete hem dwelle. What proferestow thy light here for to selle? Go selle it hem that smale seles graven, We wol thee nought, us nedeth no day haven.’ 210 And eek the sonne Tytan gan he chyde, And seyde, ‘O fool, wel may men thee dispyse, That hast the Dawing al night by thy syde, And suffrest hir so sone up fro thee ryse, For to disesen loveres in this wyse. What! hold your bed ther, thou, and eek thy Morwe! I bidde god, so yeve yow bothe sorwe!’ 211 Therwith ful sore he sighte, and thus he seyde, ‘My lady right, and of my wele or wo The welle and rote, O goodly myn, Criseyde, And shal I ryse, allas! and shal I go? Now fele I that myn herte moot a-two! For how sholde I my lyf an houre save, Sin that with yow is al the lyf I have? 212 What shal I doon, for certes, I not how, Ne whanne, allas! I shal the tyme see, That in this plyt I may be eft with yow; And of my lyf, god woot, how that shal be, Sin that desyr right now so byteth me, That I am deed anoon, but I retourne. How sholde I longe, allas! fro yow soiourne? 213 But nathelees, myn owene lady bright, Yit were it so that I wiste outrely, That I, your humble servaunt and your knight, Were in your herte set so fermely As ye in myn, the which thing, trewely, Me lever were than thise worldes tweyne, Yet sholde I bet enduren al my peyne.’ 214 To that Cryseyde answerde right anoon, And with a syk she seyde, ‘O herte dere, The game, y-wis, so ferforth now is goon, That first shal Phebus falle fro his spere, And every egle been the dowves fere, And every roche out of his place sterte, Er Troilus out of Criseydes herte! 215 Ye be so depe in-with myn herte grave, That, though I wolde it turne out of my thought, As wisly verray god my soule save, To dyen in the peyne, I coude nought! And, for the love of god that us hath wrought, Lat in your brayn non other fantasye So crepe, that it cause me to dye! 216 And that ye me wolde han as faste in minde As I have yow, that wolde I yow bi-seche; And, if I wiste soothly that to finde, God mighte not a poynt my Ioyes eche! But, herte myn, with-oute more speche, Beth to me trewe, or elles were it routhe; For I am thyn, by god and by my trouthe! 217 Beth glad for-thy, and live in sikernesse; Thus seyde I never er this, ne shal to mo; And if to yow it were a gret gladnesse To turne ayein, soone after that ye go, As fayn wolde I as ye, it were so, As wisly god myn herte bringe at reste!’ And him in armes took, and ofte keste. 218 Agayns his wil, sin it mot nedes be, This Troilus up roos, and faste him cledde, And in his armes took his lady free An hundred tyme, and on his wey him spedde, And with swich wordes as his herte bledde, He seyde, ‘farewel, my dere herte swete, Ther god us graunte sounde and sone to mete!’ 219 To which no word for sorwe she answerde, So sore gan his parting hir destreyne; And Troilus un-to his palays ferde, As woo bigon as she was, sooth to seyne; So hard him wrong of sharp desyr the peyne For to ben eft there he was in plesaunce, That it may never out of his remembraunce. 220 Retorned to his real palais, sone He softe in-to his bed gan for to slinke, To slepe longe, as he was wont to done, But al for nought; he may wel ligge and winke, But sleep ne may ther in his herte sinke; Thenkinge how she, for whom desyr him brende, A thousand-fold was worth more than he wende. 221 And in his thought gan up and doun to winde Hir wordes alle, and every contenaunce, And fermely impressen in his minde The leste poynt that to him was plesaunce; And verrayliche, of thilke remembraunce, Desyr al newe him brende, and lust to brede Gan more than erst, and yet took he non hede. 222 Criseyde also, right in the same wyse, Of Troilus gan in hir herte shette His worthinesse, his lust, his dedes wyse, His gentilesse, and how she with him mette, Thonkinge love he so wel hir bisette; Desyring eft to have hir herte dere In swich a plyt, she dorste make him chere. 223 Pandare, a-morwe which that comen was Un-to his nece, and gan hir fayre grete, Seyde, ‘al this night so reyned it, allas! That al my drede is that ye, nece swete, Han litel layser had to slepe and mete; Al night,’ quod he, ‘hath reyn so do me wake, That som of us, I trowe, hir hedes ake.’ 224 And ner he com, and seyde, ‘how stont it now This mery morwe, nece, how can ye fare?’ Criseyde answerde, ‘never the bet for yow, Fox that ye been, god yeve your herte care! God helpe me so, ye caused al this fare, Trow I,’ quod she, ‘for alle your wordes whyte; O! who-so seeth yow knoweth yow ful lyte!’ 225 With that she gan hir face for to wrye With the shete, and wex for shame al reed; And Pandarus gan under for to prye, And seyde, ‘nece, if that I shal ben deed, Have here a swerd, and smyteth of myn heed.’ With that his arm al sodeynly he thriste Under hir nekke, and at the laste hir kiste. 226 I passe al that which chargeth nought to seye, What! God foryaf his deeth, and she al-so Foryaf, and with hir uncle gan to pleye, For other cause was ther noon than so. But of this thing right to the effect to go, Whan tyme was, hom til hir hous she wente, And Pandarus hath fully his entente. 227 Now torne we ayein to Troilus, That resteles ful longe a-bedde lay, And prevely sente after Pandarus, To him to come in al the haste he may. He com anoon, nought ones seyde he ‘nay,’ And Troilus ful sobrely he grette, And doun upon his beddes syde him sette. 228 This Troilus, with al the affeccioun Of frendes love that herte may devyse, To Pandarus on kneës fil adoun, And er that he wolde of the place aryse, He gan him thonken in his beste wyse; A hondred sythe he gan the tyme blesse, That he was born to bringe him fro distresse. 229 He seyde, ‘O frend, of frendes the alderbeste That ever was, the sothe for to telle, Thou hast in hevene y-brought my soule at reste Fro Flegiton, the fery flood of helle; That, though I mighte a thousand tymes selle, Upon a day, my lyf in thy servyse, It mighte nought a mote in that suffyse. 230 The sonne, which that al the world may see, Saw never yet, my lyf, that dar I leye, So inly fair and goodly as is she, Whos I am al, and shal, til that I deye; And, that I thus am hires, dar I seye, That thanked be the heighe worthinesse Of love, and eek thy kinde bisinesse. 231 Thus hastow me no litel thing y-yive, Fo which to thee obliged be for ay My lyf, and why? for thorugh thyn help I live; For elles deed hadde I be many a day.’ And with that word doun in his bed he lay, And Pandarus ful sobrely him herde Til al was seyd, and thanne he him answerde: 232 ‘My dere frend, if I have doon for thee In any cas, god wot, it is me leef; And am as glad as man may of it be, God help me so; but tak now not a-greef That I shal seyn, be war of this myscheef, That, there-as thou now brought art in-to blisse, That thou thy-self ne cause it nought to misse. 233 For of fortunes sharp adversitee The worst kinde of infortune is this, A man to have ben in prosperitee, And it remembren, whan it passed is. Thou art wys y-nough, for-thy do nought amis; Be not to rakel, though thou sitte warme, For if thou be, certeyn, it wol thee harme. 234 Thou art at ese, and holde thee wel ther-inne. For also seur as reed is every fyr, As greet a craft is kepe wel as winne; Brydle alwey wel thy speche and thy desyr. For worldly Ioye halt not but by a wyr; That preveth wel, it brest alday so ofte; For-thy nede is to werke with it softe.’ 235 Quod Troilus, ‘I hope, and god to-forn, My dere frend, that I shal so me bere, That in my gilt ther shal no thing be lorn, Ne I nil not rakle as for to greven here; It nedeth not this matere ofte tere; For wistestow myn herte wel, Pandare, God woot, of this thou woldest litel care.’ 236 Tho gan he telle him of his glade night. And wher-of first his herte dredde, and how, And seyde, ‘freend, as I am trewe knight, And by that feyth I shal to god and yow, I hadde it never half so hote as now; And ay the more that desyr me byteth To love hir best, the more it me delyteth. 237 I noot my-self not wisly what it is; But now I fele a newe qualitee, Ye, al another than I dide er this.’ Pandare answerde, and seyde thus, that he That ones may in hevene blisse be, He feleth other weyes, dar I leye, Than thilke tyme he first herde of it seye. 238 This is o word for al; this Troilus Was never ful, to speke of this matere, And for to preysen un-to Pandarus The bountee of his righte lady dere, And Pandarus to thanke and maken chere. This tale ay was span-newe to biginne Til that the night departed hem a-twinne. 239 Sone after this, for that fortune it wolde, I-comen was the blisful tyme swete, That Troilus was warned that he sholde, Ther he was erst, Criseyde his lady mete; For which he felte his herte in Ioye flete; And feythfully gan alle the goddes herie; And lat see now if that he can be merie. 240 And holden was the forme and al the wyse, Of hir cominge, and eek of his also, As it was erst, which nedeth nought devyse. But playnly to the effect right for to go, In Ioye and seurte Pandarus hem two A-bedde broughte, whan hem bothe leste, And thus they ben in quiete and in reste. 241 Nought nedeth it to yow, sin they ben met, To aske at me if that they blythe were; For if it erst was wel, tho was it bet A thousand-fold, this nedeth not enquere. A-gon was every sorwe and every fere; And bothe, y-wis, they hadde, and so they wende, As muche Ioye as herte may comprende. 242 This is no litel thing of for to seye, This passeth every wit for to devyse; For eche of hem gan otheres lust obeye; Felicitee, which that thise clerkes wyse Commenden so, ne may not here suffyse. This Ioye may not writen been with inke, This passeth al that herte may bithinke. 243 But cruel day, so wel-awey the stounde! Gan for to aproche, as they by signes knewe, For whiche hem thoughte felen dethes wounde; So wo was hem, that changen gan hir hewe, And day they gonnen to dispyse al newe, Calling it traytour, envyous, and worse, And bitterly the dayes light they curse. 244 Quod Troilus, ‘allas! now am I war That Pirous and tho swifte stedes three, Whiche that drawen forth the sonnes char, Han goon som by-path in despyt of me; That maketh it so sone day to be; And, for the sonne him hasteth thus to ryse, Ne shal I never doon him sacrifyse!’ 245 But nedes day departe moste hem sone, And whanne hir speche doon was and hir chere, They twinne anoon as they were wont to done, And setten tyme of meting eft y-fere; And many a night they wroughte in this manere. And thus Fortune a tyme ladde in Ioye Criseyde, and eek this kinges sone of Troye. 246 In suffisaunce, in blisse, and in singinges, This Troilus gan al his lyf to lede; He spendeth, Iusteth, maketh festeyinges; He yeveth frely ofte, and chaungeth wede, And held aboute him alwey, out of drede, A world of folk, as cam him wel of kinde, The fressheste and the beste he coude fynde; 247 That swich a voys was of hym and a stevene Thorugh-out the world, of honour and largesse, That it up rong un-to the yate of hevene. And, as in love, he was in swich gladnesse, That in his herte he demede, as I gesse, That there nis lovere in this world at ese So wel as he, and thus gan love him plese. 248 The godlihede or beautee which that kinde In any other lady hadde y-set Can not the mountaunce of a knot unbinde, A-boute his herte, of al Criseydes net. He was so narwe y-masked and y-knet, That it undon on any manere syde, That nil not been, for ought that may betyde. 249 And by the hond ful ofte he wolde take This Pandarus, and in-to gardin lede, And swich a feste and swich a proces make Him of Criseyde, and of hir womanhede, And of hir beautee, that, with-outen drede, It was an hevene his wordes for to here; And thanne he wolde singe in this manere. 250 ‘Love, that of erthe and see hath governaunce, Love, that his hestes hath in hevene hye, Love, that with an holsom alliaunce Halt peples ioyned, as him list hem gye, Love, that knetteth lawe of companye, And couples doth in vertu for to dwelle, Bind this acord, that I have told and telle; 251 That that the world with feyth, which that is stable, Dyverseth so his stoundes concordinge, That elements that been so discordable Holden a bond perpetuely duringe, That Phebus mote his rosy day forth bringe, And that the mone hath lordship over the nightes, Al this doth Love; ay heried be his mightes! 252 That that the see, that gredy is to flowen, Constreyneth to a certeyn ende so His flodes, that so fersly they ne growen To drenchen erthe and al for ever-mo; And if that Love ought lete his brydel go, Al that now loveth a-sonder sholde lepe, And lost were al, that Love halt now to-hepe. 253 So wolde god, that auctor is of kinde, That, with his bond, Love of his vertu liste To cerclen hertes alle, and faste binde, That from his bond no wight the wey out wiste. And hertes colde, hem wolde I that he twiste To make hem love, and that hem leste ay rewe On hertes sore, and kepe hem that ben trewe.’ 254 In alle nedes, for the tounes werre, He was, and ay the firste in armes dight; And certeynly, but-if that bokes erre, Save Ector, most y-drad of any wight; And this encrees of hardinesse and might Cam him of love, his ladies thank to winne, That altered his spirit so with-inne. 255 In tyme of trewe, on haukinge wolde he ryde, Or elles hunten boor, bere, or lyoun; The smale bestes leet he gon bi-syde. And whan that he com rydinge in-to toun, Ful ofte his lady, from hir window doun, As fresh as faucon comen out of muwe, Ful redy was, him goodly to saluwe. 256 And most of love and vertu was his speche, And in despyt hadde alle wrecchednesse; And doutelees, no nede was him biseche To honouren hem that hadde worthinesse, And esen hem that weren in distresse. And glad was he if any wight wel ferde, That lover was, whan he it wiste or herde. 257 For sooth to seyn, he lost held every wight But-if he were in loves heigh servyse, I mene folk that oughte it been of right. And over al this, so wel coude he devyse Of sentement, and in so unkouth wyse Al his array, that every lover thoughte, That al was wel, what-so he seyde or wroughte. 258 And though that he be come of blood royal, Him liste of pryde at no wight for to chase; Benigne he was to ech in general, For which he gat him thank in every place. Thus wolde Love, y-heried be his grace, That Pryde, Envye, Ire, and Avaryce He gan to flee, and every other vyce. 259 Thou lady bright, the doughter to Dione, Thy blinde and winged sone eek, daun Cupyde; Ye sustren nyne eek, that by Elicone In hil Parnaso listen for to abyde, That ye thus fer han deyned me to gyde, I can no more, but sin that ye wol wende, Ye heried been for ay, with-outen ende! 260 Thourgh yow have I seyd fully in my song Theffect and Ioye of Troilus servyse, Al be that ther was som disese among, As to myn auctor listeth to devyse. My thridde book now ende ich in this wyse; And Troilus in luste and in quiete Is with Criseyde, his owne herte swete. Explicit Liber Tercius. BOOK IV. [Prohemium.] 1 But al to litel, weylawey the whyle, Lasteth swich Ioye, y-thonked be Fortune! That semeth trewest, whan she wol bygyle, And can to foles so hir song entune, That she hem hent and blent, traytour comune; And whan a wight is from hir wheel y-throwe, Than laugheth she, and maketh him the mowe. 2 From Troilus she gan hir brighte face Awey to wrythe, and took of him non hede, But caste him clene oute of his lady grace, And on hir wheel she sette up Diomede; For which right now myn herte ginneth blede, And now my penne, allas! with which I wryte, Quaketh for drede of that I moot endyte. 3 For how Criseyde Troilus forsook, Or at the leste, how that she was unkinde, Mot hennes-forth ben matere of my book, As wryten folk thorugh which it is in minde. Allas! that they shulde ever cause finde To speke hir harm; and if they on hir lye, Y-wis, hem-self sholde han the vilanye. 4 O ye Herines, Nightes doughtren three, That endelees compleynen ever in pyne, Megera, Alete, and eek Thesiphone; Thou cruel Mars eek, fader to Quiryne, This ilke ferthe book me helpeth fyne, So that the los of lyf and love y-fere Of Troilus be fully shewed here. Explicit [prohemium]. Incipit Quartus Liber. 5 Ligginge in ost, as I have seyd er this, The Grekes stronge, aboute Troye toun, Bifel that, whan that Phebus shyning is Up-on the brest of Hercules Lyoun, That Ector, with ful many a bold baroun, Caste on a day with Grekes for to fighte, As he was wont to greve hem what he mighte. 6 Not I how longe or short it was bitwene This purpos and that day they fighte mente; But on a day wel armed, bright and shene, Ector, and many a worthy wight out wente, With spere in hond and bigge bowes bente; And in the berd, with-oute lenger lette, Hir fomen in the feld anoon hem mette. 7 The longe day, with speres sharpe y-grounde, With arwes, dartes, swerdes, maces felle, They fighte and bringen hors and man to grounde, And with hir axes out the braynes quelle. But in the laste shour, sooth for to telle, The folk of Troye hem-selven so misledden, That with the worse at night homward they fledden. 8 At whiche day was taken Antenor, Maugre Polydamas or Monesteo, Santippe, Sarpedon, Polynestor, Polyte, or eek the Troian daun Ripheo, And othere lasse folk, as Phebuseo. So that, for harm, that day the folk of Troye Dredden to lese a greet part of hir Ioye. 9 Of Pryamus was yeve, at Greek requeste, A tyme of trewe, and tho they gonnen trete, Hir prisoneres to chaungen, moste and leste, And for the surplus yeven sommes grete. This thing anoon was couth in every strete, Bothe in thassege, in toune, and every-where, And with the firste it cam to Calkas ere. 10 Whan Calkas knew this tretis sholde holde, In consistorie, among the Grekes, sone He gan in thringe forth, with lordes olde, And sette him there-as he was wont to done; And with a chaunged face hem bad a bone, For love of god, to don that reverence, To stinte noyse, and yeve him audience. 11 Thanne seyde he thus, ‘lo! lordes myne, I was Troian, as it is knowen out of drede; And if that yow remembre, I am Calkas, That alderfirst yaf comfort to your nede, And tolde wel how that ye sholden spede. For dredelees, thorugh yow, shal, in a stounde, Ben Troye y-brend, and beten doun to grounde. 12 And in what forme, or in what maner wyse This town to shende, and al your lust to acheve, Ye han er this wel herd it me devyse; This knowe ye, my lordes, as I leve. And for the Grekes weren me so leve, I com my-self in my propre persone, To teche in this how yow was best to done; 13 Havinge un-to my tresour ne my rente Right no resport, to respect of your ese. Thus al my good I loste and to yow wente, Wening in this you, lordes, for to plese. But al that los ne doth me no disese. I vouche-sauf, as wisly have I Ioye, For you to lese al that I have in Troye, 14 Save of a doughter, that I lafte, allas! Slepinge at hoom, whanne out of Troye I sterte. O sterne, O cruel fader that I was! How mighte I have in that so hard an herte? Allas! I ne hadde y-brought hir in hir sherte! For sorwe of which I wol not live to morwe, But-if ye lordes rewe up-on my sorwe. 15 For, by that cause I say no tyme er now Hir to delivere, I holden have my pees; But now or never, if that it lyke yow, I may hir have right sone, doutelees. O help and grace! amonges al this prees, Rewe on this olde caitif in destresse, Sin I through yow have al this hevinesse! 16 Ye have now caught and fetered in prisoun Troians y-nowe; and if your willes be, My child with oon may have redempcioun. Now for the love of god and of bountee, Oon of so fele, allas! so yeve him me. What nede were it this preyere for to werne, Sin ye shul bothe han folk and toun as yerne? 17 On peril of my lyf, I shal not lye, Appollo hath me told it feithfully; I have eek founde it by astronomye, By sort, and by augurie eek trewely, And dar wel seye, the tyme is faste by, That fyr and flaumbe on al the toun shal sprede; And thus shal Troye turne in asshen dede. 18 For certeyn, Phebus and Neptunus bothe, That makeden the walles of the toun, Ben with the folk of Troye alwey so wrothe, That thei wol bringe it to confusioun, Right in despyt of king Lameadoun. By-cause he nolde payen hem hir hyre, The toun of Troye shal ben set on-fyre.’ 19 Telling his tale alwey, this olde greye, Humble in speche, and in his lokinge eke, The salte teres from his eyën tweye Ful faste ronnen doun by eyther cheke. So longe he gan of socour hem by-seke That, for to hele him of his sorwes sore, They yave him Antenor, with-oute more. 20 But who was glad y-nough but Calkas tho? And of this thing ful sone his nedes leyde On hem that sholden for the tretis go, And hem for Antenor ful ofte preyde To bringen hoom king Toas and Criseyde; And whan Pryam his save-garde sente, Thembassadours to Troye streyght they wente. 21 The cause y-told of hir cominge, the olde Pryam the king ful sone in general Let here-upon his parlement to holde, Of which the effect rehersen yow I shal. Thembassadours ben answered for fynal, Theschaunge of prisoners and al this nede Hem lyketh wel, and forth in they procede. 22 This Troilus was present in the place, Whan axed was for Antenor Criseyde, For which ful sone chaungen gan his face, As he that with tho wordes wel neigh deyde. But nathelees, he no word to it seyde, Lest men sholde his affeccioun espye; With mannes herte he gan his sorwes drye. 23 And ful of anguish and of grisly drede Abood what lordes wolde un-to it seye; And if they wolde graunte, as god forbede, Theschaunge of hir, than thoughte he thinges tweye, First, how to save hir honour, and what weye He mighte best theschaunge of hir withstonde; Ful faste he caste how al this mighte stonde. 24 Love him made al prest to doon hir byde, And rather dye than she sholde go; But resoun seyde him, on that other syde, ‘With-oute assent of hir ne do not so, Lest for thy werk she wolde be thy fo, And seyn, that thorugh thy medling is y-blowe Your bother love, there it was erst unknowe.’ 25 For which he gan deliberen, for the beste, That though the lordes wolde that she wente, He wolde late hem graunte what hem leste, And telle his lady first what that they mente. And whan that she had seyd him hir entente, Ther-after wolde he werken also blyve, Though al the world ayein it wolde stryve. 26 Ector, which that wel the Grekes herde, For Antenor how they wolde han Criseyde, Gan it withstonde, and sobrely answerde:— ‘Sires, she nis no prisoner,’ he seyde; ‘I noot on yow who that this charge leyde, But, on my part, ye may eft-sone him telle, We usen here no wommen for to selle.’ 27 The noyse of peple up-stirte thanne at ones, As breme as blase of straw y-set on fyre; For infortune it wolde, for the nones, They sholden hir confusioun desyre. ‘Ector,’ quod they, ‘what goost may yow enspyre, This womman thus to shilde and doon us lese Daun Antenor?—a wrong wey now ye chese— 28 That is so wys, and eek so bold baroun, And we han nede of folk, as men may see; He is eek oon, the grettest of this toun; O Ector, lat tho fantasyës be! O king Pryam,’ quod they, ‘thus seggen we, That al our voys is to for-gon Criseyde;’ And to deliveren Antenor they preyde. 29 O Iuvenal, lord! trewe is thy sentence, That litel witen folk what is to yerne That they ne finde in hir desyr offence; For cloud of errour lat hem not descerne What best is; and lo, here ensample as yerne. This folk desiren now deliveraunce Of Antenor, that broughte hem to mischaunce! 30 For he was after traytour to the toun Of Troye; allas! they quitte him out to rathe; O nyce world, lo, thy discrecioun! Criseyde, which that never dide hem skathe, Shal now no lenger in hir blisse bathe; But Antenor, he shal com hoom to toune, And she shal out; thus seyden here and howne. 31 For which delibered was by parlement, For Antenor to yelden up Criseyde, And it pronounced by the president, Al-theigh that Ector ‘nay’ ful ofte preyde. And fynaly, what wight that it with-seyde, It was for nought, it moste been, and sholde; For substaunce of the parlement it wolde. 32 Departed out of parlement echone, This Troilus, with-oute wordes mo, Un-to his chaumbre spedde him faste allone, But-if it were a man of his or two, The whiche he bad out faste for to go, By-cause he wolde slepen, as he seyde, And hastely up-on his bed him leyde. 33 And as in winter leves been biraft, Eche after other, til the tree be bare, So that ther nis but bark and braunche y-laft, Lyth Troilus, biraft of ech wel-fare, Y-bounden in the blake bark of care, Disposed wood out of his wit to breyde, So sore him sat the chaunginge of Criseyde. 34 He rist him up, and every dore he shette And windowe eek, and tho this sorweful man Up-on his beddes syde a-doun him sette, Ful lyk a deed image pale and wan; And in his brest the heped wo bigan Out-breste, and he to werken in this wyse In his woodnesse, as I shal yow devyse. 35 Right as the wilde bole biginneth springe Now here, now there, y-darted to the herte, And of his deeth roreth in compleyninge, Right so gan he aboute the chaumbre sterte, Smyting his brest ay with his festes smerte; His heed to the wal, his body to the grounde Ful ofte he swapte, him-selven to confounde. 36 His eyen two, for pitee of his herte, Out stremeden as swifte welles tweye; The heighe sobbes of his sorwes smerte His speche him rafte, unnethes mighte he seye, ‘O deeth, allas! why niltow do me deye? A-cursed be the day which that nature Shoop me to ben a lyves creature!’ 37 But after, whan the furie and the rage Which that his herte twiste and faste threste, By lengthe of tyme somwhat gan asswage, Up-on his bed he leyde him doun to reste; But tho bigonne his teres more out-breste, That wonder is, the body may suffyse To half this wo, which that I yow devyse. 38 Than seyde he thus, ‘Fortune! allas the whyle! What have I doon, what have I thus a-gilt? How mightestow for reuthe me bigyle? Is ther no grace, and shal I thus be spilt? Shal thus Criseyde awey, for that thou wilt? Allas! how maystow in thyn herte finde To been to me thus cruel and unkinde? 39 Have I thee nought honoured al my lyve, As thou wel wost, above the goddes alle? Why wiltow me fro Ioye thus depryve? O Troilus, what may men now thee calle But wrecche of wrecches, out of honour falle In-to miserie, in which I wol biwayle Criseyde, allas! til that the breeth me fayle? 40 Allas, Fortune! if that my lyf in Ioye Displesed hadde un-to thy foule envye, Why ne haddestow my fader, king of Troye, By-raft the lyf, or doon my bretheren dye, Or slayn my-self, that thus compleyne and crye, I, combre-world, that may of no-thing serve, But ever dye, and never fully sterve? 41 If that Criseyde allone were me laft, Nought roughte I whider thou woldest me stere; And hir, allas! than hastow me biraft. But ever-more, lo! this is thy manere, To reve a wight that most is to him dere, To preve in that thy gerful violence. Thus am I lost, ther helpeth no defence! 42 O verray lord of love, O god, allas! That knowest best myn herte and al my thought, What shal my sorwful lyf don in this cas If I for-go that I so dere have bought? Sin ye Cryseyde and me han fully brought In-to your grace, and bothe our hertes seled, How may ye suffre, allas! it be repeled? 43 What I may doon, I shal, whyl I may dure On lyve in torment and in cruel peyne, This infortune or this disaventure, Allone as I was born, y-wis, compleyne; Ne never wil I seen it shyne or reyne; But ende I wil, as Edippe, in derknesse My sorwful lyf, and dyen in distresse. 44 O wery goost, that errest to and fro, Why niltow fleen out of the wofulleste Body, that ever mighte on grounde go? O soule, lurkinge in this wo, unneste, Flee forth out of myn herte, and lat it breste, And folwe alwey Criseyde, thy lady dere; Thy righte place is now no lenger here! 45 O wofulle eyen two, sin your disport Was al to seen Criseydes eyen brighte, What shal ye doon but, for my discomfort, Stonden for nought, and wepen out your sighte? Sin she is queynt, that wont was yow to lighte, In veyn fro-this-forth have I eyen tweye Y-formed, sin your vertue is a-weye. 46 O my Criseyde, O lady sovereyne Of thilke woful soule that thus cryeth, Who shal now yeven comfort to the peyne? Allas, no wight; but when myn herte dyeth, My spirit, which that so un-to yow hyeth, Receyve in gree, for that shal ay yow serve; For-thy no fors is, though the body sterve. 47 O ye loveres, that heighe upon the wheel Ben set of Fortune, in good aventure, God leve that ye finde ay love of steel, And longe mot your lyf in Ioye endure! But whan ye comen by my sepulture, Remembreth that your felawe resteth there; For I lovede eek, though I unworthy were. 48 O olde unholsom and mislyved man, Calkas I mene, allas! what eyleth thee To been a Greek, sin thou art born Troian? O Calkas, which that wilt my bane be, In cursed tyme was thou born for me! As wolde blisful Iove, for his Ioye, That I thee hadde, where I wolde, in Troye!’ 49 A thousand sykes, hottere than the glede, Out of his brest ech after other wente, Medled with pleyntes newe, his wo to fede, For which his woful teres never stente; And shortly, so his peynes him to-rente, And wex so mat, that Ioye nor penaunce He feleth noon, but lyth forth in a traunce. 50 Pandare, which that in the parlement Hadde herd what every lord and burgeys seyde, And how ful graunted was, by oon assent, For Antenor to yelden so Criseyde, Gan wel neigh wood out of his wit to breyde, So that, for wo, he niste what he mente; But in a rees to Troilus he wente. 51 A certeyn knight, that for the tyme kepte The chaumbre-dore, un-dide it him anoon; And Pandare, that ful tendreliche wepte, In-to the derke chaumbre, as stille as stoon, Toward the bed gan softely to goon, So confus, that he niste what to seye; For verray wo his wit was neigh aweye. 52 And with his chere and loking al to-torn, For sorwe of this, and with his armes folden, He stood this woful Troilus biforn, And on his pitous face he gan biholden; But lord, so often gan his herte colden, Seing his freend in wo, whos hevinesse His herte slow, as thoughte him, for distresse. 53 This woful wight, this Troilus, that felte His freend Pandare y-comen him to see, Gan as the snow ayein the sonne melte, For which this sorwful Pandare, of pitee, Gan for to wepe as tendreliche as he; And specheles thus been thise ilke tweye, That neyther mighte o word for sorwe seye. 54 But at the laste this woful Troilus, Ney deed for smert, gan bresten out to rore, And with a sorwful noyse he seyde thus, Among his sobbes and his sykes sore, ‘Lo! Pandare, I am deed, with-outen more. Hastow nought herd at parlement,’ he seyde, ‘For Antenor how lost is my Criseyde?’ 55 This Pandarus, ful deed and pale of hewe, Ful pitously answerde and seyde, ‘yis! As wisly were it fals as it is trewe, That I have herd, and wot al how it is. O mercy, god, who wolde have trowed this? Who wolde have wend that, in so litel a throwe, Fortune our Ioye wolde han over-throwe? 56 For in this world ther is no creature, As to my doom, that ever saw ruyne Straungere than this, thorugh cas or aventure. But who may al eschewe or al devyne? Swich is this world; for-thy I thus defyne, Ne trust no wight to finden in Fortune Ay propretee; hir yeftes been comune. 57 But tel me this, why thou art now so mad To sorwen thus? Why lystow in this wyse, Sin thy desyr al holly hastow had, So that, by right, it oughte y-now suffyse? But I, that never felte in my servyse A frendly chere or loking of an yë, Lat me thus wepe and wayle, til I dye. 58 And over al this, as thou wel wost thy-selve, This town is ful of ladies al aboute; And, to my doom, fairer than swiche twelve As ever she was, shal I finde, in som route, Ye, oon or two, with-outen any doute. For-thy be glad, myn owene dere brother, If she be lost, we shul recovere another. 59 What, god for-bede alwey that ech plesaunce In o thing were, and in non other wight! If oon can singe, another can wel daunce; If this be goodly, she is glad and light; And this is fayr, and that can good a-right. Ech for his vertu holden is for dere, Bothe heroner and faucon for rivere. 60 And eek, as writ Zanzis, that was ful wys, “The newe love out chaceth ofte the olde;” And up-on newe cas lyth newe avys. Thenk eek, thy-self to saven artow holde; Swich fyr, by proces, shal of kinde colde. For sin it is but casuel plesaunce, Som cas shal putte it out of remembraunce. 61 For al-so seur as day cometh after night, The newe love, labour or other wo, Or elles selde seinge of a wight, Don olde affecciouns alle over-go. And, for thy part, thou shalt have oon of tho To abrigge with thy bittre peynes smerte; Absence of hir shal dryve hir out of herte.’ 62 Thise wordes seyde he for the nones alle, To helpe his freend, lest he for sorwe deyde. For doutelees, to doon his wo to falle, He roughte not what unthrift that he seyde. But Troilus, that neigh for sorwe deyde, Tok litel hede of al that ever he mente; Oon ere it herde, at the other out it wente:— 63 But at the laste answerde and seyde, ‘freend, This lechecraft, or heled thus to be, Were wel sitting, if that I were a feend, To traysen hir that trewe is unto me! I pray god, lat this consayl never y-thee; But do me rather sterve anon-right here Er I thus do as thou me woldest lere. 64 She that I serve, y-wis, what so thou seye, To whom myn herte enhabit is by right, Shal han me holly hires til that I deye. For, Pandarus, sin I have trouthe hir hight, I wol not been untrewe for no wight; But as hir man I wol ay live and sterve, And never other creature serve. 65 And ther thou seyst, thou shalt as faire finde As she, lat be, make no comparisoun To creature y-formed here by kinde. O leve Pandare, in conclusioun, I wol not be of thyn opinioun, Touching al this; for whiche I thee biseche, So hold thy pees; thou sleest me with thy speche. 66 Thow biddest me I sholde love an-other Al freshly newe, and lat Criseyde go! It lyth not in my power, leve brother. And though I mighte, I wolde not do so. But canstow pleyen raket, to and fro, Netle in, dokke out, now this, now that, Pandare? Now foule falle hir, for thy wo that care! 67 Thow farest eek by me, thou Pandarus, As he, that whan a wight is wo bi-goon, He cometh to him a pas, and seyth right thus, “Thenk not on smert, and thou shalt fele noon.” Thou most me first transmuwen in a stoon, And reve me my passiounes alle, Er thou so lightly do my wo to falle. 68 The deeth may wel out of my brest departe The lyf, so longe may this sorwe myne; But fro my soule shal Criseydes darte Out never-mo; but doun with Proserpyne, Whan I am deed, I wol go wone in pyne; And ther I wol eternally compleyne My wo, and how that twinned be we tweyne. 69 Thow hast here maad an argument, for fyn, How that it sholde lasse peyne be Criseyde to for-goon, for she was myn, And live in ese and in felicitee. Why gabbestow, that seydest thus to me That “him is wors that is fro wele y-throwe, Than he hadde erst non of that wele y-knowe?” 70 But tel me now, sin that thee thinketh so light To chaungen so in love, ay to and fro, Why hastow not don bisily thy might To chaungen hir that doth thee al thy wo? Why niltow lete hir fro thyn herte go? Why niltow love an-other lady swete, That may thyn herte setten in quiete? 71 If thou hast had in love ay yet mischaunce, And canst it not out of thyn herte dryve, I, that livede in lust and in plesaunce With hir as muche as creature on-lyve, How sholde I that foryete, and that so blyve? O where hastow ben hid so longe in muwe, That canst so wel and formely arguwe? 72 Nay, nay, god wot, nought worth is al thy reed, For which, for what that ever may bifalle, With-outen wordes mo, I wol be deed. O deeth, that endere art of sorwes alle, Com now, sin I so ofte after thee calle, For sely is that deeth, soth for to seyne, That, ofte y-cleped, cometh and endeth peyne. 73 Wel wot I, whyl my lyf was in quiete, Er thou me slowe, I wolde have yeven hyre; But now thy cominge is to me so swete, That in this world I no-thing so desyre. O deeth, sin with this sorwe I am a-fyre, Thou outher do me anoon in teres drenche, Or with thy colde strook myn hete quenche! 74 Sin that thou sleest so fele in sondry wyse Ayens hir wil, unpreyed, day and night, Do me, at my requeste, this servyse, Delivere now the world, so dostow right, Of me, that am the wofulleste wight That ever was; for tyme is that I sterve, Sin in this world of right nought may I serve.’ 75 This Troilus in teres gan distille, As licour out of alambyk ful faste; And Pandarus gan holde his tunge stille, And to the ground his eyen doun he caste. But nathelees, thus thoughte he at the laste, ‘What, parde, rather than my felawe deye, Yet shal I som-what more un-to him seye:’ 76 And seyde, ‘freend, sin thou hast swich distresse, And sin thee list myn arguments to blame, Why nilt thy-selven helpen doon redresse, And with thy manhod letten al this grame? Go ravisshe hir ne canstow not for shame! And outher lat hir out of toune fare, Or hold hir stille, and leve thy nyce fare. 77 Artow in Troye, and hast non hardiment To take a womman which that loveth thee, And wolde hir-selven been of thyn assent? Now is not this a nyce vanitee? Rys up anoon, and lat this weping be, And kyth thou art a man, for in this houre I wil be deed, or she shal bleven oure.’ 78 To this answerde him Troilus ful softe, And seyde, ‘parde, leve brother dere, Al this have I my-self yet thought ful ofte, And more thing than thou devysest here. But why this thing is laft, thou shalt wel here; And whan thou me hast yeve an audience, Ther-after mayst thou telle al thy sentence. 79 First, sin thou wost this toun hath al this werre For ravisshing of wommen so by might, It sholde not be suffred me to erre, As it stant now, ne doon so gret unright. I sholde han also blame of every wight, My fadres graunt if that I so withstode, Sin she is chaunged for the tounes goode. 80 I have eek thought, so it were hir assent, To aske hir at my fader, of his grace; Than thenke I, this were hir accusement, Sin wel I woot I may hir not purchace. For sin my fader, in so heigh a place As parlement, hath hir eschaunge enseled, He nil for me his lettre be repeled. 81 Yet drede I most hir herte to pertourbe With violence, if I do swich a game; For if I wolde it openly distourbe, It moste been disclaundre to hir name. And me were lever deed than hir defame, As nolde god but-if I sholde have Hir honour lever than my lyf to save! 82 Thus am I lost, for ought that I can see; For certeyn is, sin that I am hir knight, I moste hir honour levere han than me In every cas, as lovere oughte of right. Thus am I with desyr and reson twight; Desyr for to distourben hir me redeth, And reson nil not, so myn herte dredeth.’ 83 Thus wepinge that he coude never cesse, He seyde, ‘allas! how shal I, wrecche, fare? For wel fele I alwey my love encresse, And hope is lasse and lasse alwey, Pandare! Encressen eek the causes of my care; So wel-a-wey, why nil myn herte breste? For, as in love, ther is but litel reste.’ 84 Pandare answerde, ‘freend, thou mayst, for me, Don as thee list; but hadde ich it so hote, And thyn estat, she sholde go with me; Though al this toun cryede on this thing by note, I nolde sette at al that noyse a grote. For when men han wel cryed, than wol they roune; A wonder last but nyne night never in toune. 85 Devyne not in reson ay so depe Ne curteysly, but help thy-self anoon; Bet is that othere than thy-selven wepe, And namely, sin ye two been al oon. Rys up, for by myn heed, she shal not goon; And rather be in blame a lyte y-founde Than sterve here as a gnat, with-oute wounde. 86 It is no shame un-to yow, ne no vyce Hir to with-holden, that ye loveth most. Paraunter, she mighte holden thee for nyce To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost. Thenk eek Fortune, as wel thy-selven wost, Helpeth hardy man to his empryse, And weyveth wrecches, for hir cowardyse. 87 And though thy lady wolde a litel hir greve, Thou shalt thy pees ful wel here-after make, But as for me, certayn, I can not leve That she wolde it as now for yvel take. Why sholde than for ferd thyn herte quake? Thenk eek how Paris hath, that is thy brother, A love; and why shaltow not have another? 88 And Troilus, o thing I dar thee swere, That if Criseyde, whiche that is thy leef, Now loveth thee as wel as thou dost here, God helpe me so, she nil not take a-greef, Though thou do bote a-noon in this mischeef. And if she wilneth fro thee for to passe, Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse. 89 For-thy tak herte, and thenk, right as a knight, Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe. Kyth now sumwhat thy corage and thy might, Have mercy on thy-self, for any awe. Lat not this wrecched wo thin herte gnawe, But manly set the world on sixe and sevene; And, if thou deye a martir, go to hevene. 90 I wol my-self be with thee at this dede, Though ich and al my kin, up-on a stounde, Shulle in a strete as dogges liggen dede, Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde. In every cas I wol a freend be founde. And if thee list here sterven as a wrecche, A-dieu, the devel spede him that it recche!’ 91 This Troilus gan with tho wordes quiken, And seyde, ‘freend, graunt mercy, ich assente; But certaynly thou mayst not me so priken, Ne peyne noon ne may me so tormente, That, for no cas, it is not myn entente, At shorte wordes, though I dyen sholde, To ravisshe hir, but-if hir-self it wolde.’ 92 ‘Why, so mene I,’ quod Pandarus, ‘al this day. But tel me than, hastow hir wel assayed, That sorwest thus?’ And he answerde, ‘nay.’ ‘Wher-of artow,’ quod Pandare, ‘than a-mayed, That nost not that she wol ben yvel apayed To ravisshe hir, sin thou hast not ben there, But-if that Iove tolde it in thyn ere? 93 For-thy rys up, as nought ne were, anoon, And wash thy face, and to the king thou wende, Or he may wondren whider thou art goon. Thou most with wisdom him and othere blende; Or, up-on cas, he may after thee sende Er thou be war; and shortly, brother dere, Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere. 94 For I shal shape it so, that sikerly Thou shalt this night som tyme, in som manere, Com speke with thy lady prevely, And by hir wordes eek, and by hir chere, Thou shalt ful sone aparceyve and wel here Al hir entente, and in this cas the beste; And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.’ 95 The swifte Fame, whiche that false thinges Egal reporteth lyk the thinges trewe, Was thorugh-out Troye y-fled with preste winges Fro man to man, and made this tale al newe, How Calkas doughter, with hir brighte hewe, At parlement, with-oute wordes more, I-graunted was in chaunge of Antenore. 96 The whiche tale anoon-right as Criseyde Had herd, she which that of hir fader roughte, As in this cas, right nought, ne whanne he deyde, Ful bisily to Iuppiter bisoughte Yeve him mischaunce that this tretis broughte. But shortly, lest thise tales sothe were, She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere. 97 As she that hadde hir herte and al hir minde On Troilus y-set so wonder faste, That al this world ne mighte hir love unbinde, Ne Troilus out of hir herte caste; She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste. And thus she brenneth bothe in love and drede, So that she niste what was best to rede. 98 But as men seen in toune, and al aboute, That wommen usen frendes to visyte, So to Criseyde of wommen com a route For pitous Ioye, and wenden hir delyte; And with hir tales, dere y-nough a myte, These wommen, whiche that in the cite dwelle, They sette hem doun, and seyde as I shal telle. 99 Quod first that oon, ‘I am glad, trewely, By-cause of yow, that shal your fader see.’ A-nother seyde, ‘y-wis, so nam not I; For al to litel hath she with us be.’ Quod tho the thridde, ‘I hope, y-wis, that she Shal bringen us the pees on every syde, That, whan she gooth, almighty god hir gyde!’ 100 Tho wordes and tho wommannisshe thinges, She herde hem right as though she thennes were; For, god it wot, hir herte on other thing is, Although the body sat among hem there. Hir advertence is alwey elles-where; For Troilus ful faste hir soule soughte; With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte. 101 Thise wommen, that thus wenden hir to plese, Aboute nought gonne alle hir tales spende; Swich vanitee ne can don hir non ese, As she that, al this mene whyle, brende Of other passioun than that they wende, So that she felte almost hir herte deye For wo, and wery of that companye. 102 For which no lenger mighte she restreyne Hir teres, so they gonnen up to welle, That yeven signes of the bitter peyne In whiche hir spirit was, and moste dwelle; Remembring hir, fro heven unto which helle She fallen was, sith she forgoth the sighte Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte. 103 And thilke foles sittinge hir aboute Wenden, that she wepte and syked sore By-cause that she sholde out of that route Departe, and never pleye with hem more. And they that hadde y-knowen hir of yore Seye hir so wepe, and thoughte it kindenesse, And eche of hem wepte eek for hir distresse; 104 And bisily they gonnen hir conforten Of thing, god wot, on which she litel thoughte; And with hir tales wenden hir disporten, And to be glad they often hir bisoughte. But swich an ese ther-with they hir wroughte Right as a man is esed for to fele, For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele! 105 But after al this nyce vanitee They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle. Criseyde, ful of sorweful pitee, In-to hir chaumbre up wente out of the halle, And on hir bed she gan for deed to falle, In purpos never thennes for to ryse; And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse. 106 Hir ounded heer, that sonnish was of hewe, She rente, and eek hir fingres longe and smale She wrong ful ofte, and bad god on hir rewe, And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale. Hir hewe, whylom bright, that tho was pale, Bar witnes of hir wo and hir constreynte; And thus she spak, sobbinge, in hir compleynte: 107 ‘Alas!’ quod she, ‘out of this regioun I, woful wrecche and infortuned wight, And born in corsed constellacioun, Mot goon, and thus departen fro my knight; Wo worth, allas! that ilke dayes light On which I saw him first with eyen tweyne, That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!’ 108 Therwith the teres from hir eyen two Doun fille, as shour in Aperill, ful swythe; Hir whyte brest she bet, and for the wo After the deeth she cryed a thousand sythe, Sin he that wont hir wo was for to lythe, She mot for-goon; for which disaventure She held hir-self a forlost creature. 109 She seyde, ‘how shal he doon, and I also? How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne? O dere herte eek, that I love so, Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne? O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne! O moder myn, that cleped were Argyve, Wo worth that day that thou me bere on lyve! 110 To what fyn sholde I live and sorwen thus? How sholde a fish with-oute water dure? What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus? How sholde a plaunte or lyves creature Live, with-oute his kinde noriture? For which ful oft a by-word here I seye, That, “rotelees, mot grene sone deye.” 111 I shal don thus, sin neither swerd ne darte Dar I non handle, for the crueltee, That ilke day that I from yow departe, If sorwe of that nil not my bane be, Than shal no mete or drinke come in me Til I my soule out of my breste unshethe; And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe. 112 And, Troilus, my clothes everichoon Shul blake been, in tokeninge, herte swete, That I am as out of this world agoon, That wont was yow to setten in quiete; And of myn ordre, ay til deeth me mete, The observaunce ever, in your absence, Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence. 113 Myn herte and eek the woful goost ther-inne Biquethe I, with your spirit to compleyne Eternally, for they shul never twinne. For though in erthe y-twinned be we tweyne, Yet in the feld of pitee, out of peyne, That hight Elysos, shul we been y-fere, As Orpheus and Erudice his fere. 114 Thus herte myn, for Antenor, allas! I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene. But how shul ye don in this sorwful cas, How shal your tendre herte this sustene? But herte myn, for-yet this sorwe and tene, And me also; for, soothly for to seye, So ye wel fare, I recche not to deye.’ 115 How mighte it ever y-red ben or y-songe, The pleynte that she made in hir distresse? I noot; but, as for me, my litel tonge, If I discreven wolde hir hevinesse, It sholde make hir sorwe seme lesse Than that it was, and childishly deface Hir heigh compleynte, and therfore I it pace. 116 Pandare, which that sent from Troilus Was to Criseyde, as ye han herd devyse, That for the beste it was accorded thus, And he ful glad to doon him that servyse, Un-to Criseyde, in a ful secree wyse, Ther-as she lay in torment and in rage, Com hir to telle al hoolly his message. 117 And fond that she hir-selven gan to trete Ful pitously; for with hir salte teres Hir brest, hir face y-bathed was ful wete; The mighty tresses of hir sonnish heres, Unbroyden, hangen al aboute hir eres; Which yaf him verray signal of martyre Of deeth, which that hir herte gan desyre. 118 Whan she him saw, she gan for sorwe anoon Hir tery face a-twixe hir armes hyde, For which this Pandare is so wo bi-goon, That in the hous he mighte unnethe abyde, As he that pitee felte on every syde. For if Criseyde hadde erst compleyned sore, Tho gan she pleyne a thousand tymes more. 119 And in hir aspre pleynte than she seyde, ‘Pandare first of Ioyes mo than two Was cause causinge un-to me, Criseyde, That now transmuwed been in cruel wo. Wher shal I seye to yow “wel come” or no, That alderfirst me broughte in-to servyse Of love, allas! that endeth in swich wyse? 120 Endeth than love in wo? Ye, or men lyeth! And alle worldly blisse, as thinketh me, The ende of blisse ay sorwe it occupyeth; And who-so troweth not that it so be, Lat him upon me, woful wrecche, y-see, That my-self hate, and ay my birthe acorse, Felinge alwey, fro wikke I go to worse. 121 Who-so me seeth, he seeth sorwe al at ones, Peyne, torment, pleynte, wo, distresse. Out of my woful body harm ther noon is, As anguish, langour, cruel bitternesse, A-noy, smert, drede, fury, and eek siknesse. I trowe, y-wis, from hevene teres reyne, For pitee of myn aspre and cruel peyne!’ 122 ‘And thou, my suster, ful of discomfort,’ Quod Pandarus, ‘what thenkestow to do? Why ne hastow to thy-selven som resport, Why woltow thus thy-selve, allas, for-do? Leef al this werk and tak now hede to That I shal seyn, and herkne, of good entente, This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.’ 123 Torned hir tho Criseyde, a wo makinge So greet that it a deeth was for to see:— ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘what wordes may ye bringe? What wol my dere herte seyn to me, Which that I drede never-mo to see? Wol he have pleynte or teres, er I wende? I have y-nowe, if he ther-after sende!’ 124 She was right swich to seen in hir visage As is that wight that men on bere binde; Hir face, lyk of Paradys the image, Was al y-chaunged in another kinde. The pleye, the laughtre men was wont to finde In hir, and eek hir Ioyes everychone, Ben fled, and thus lyth now Criseyde allone. 125 Aboute hir eyen two a purpre ring Bi-trent, in sothfast tokninge of hir peyne, That to biholde it was a dedly thing, For which Pandare mighte not restreyne The teres from his eyen for to reyne. But nathelees, as he best mighte, he seyde From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde. 126 ‘Lo, nece, I trowe ye han herd al how The king, with othere lordes, for the beste, Hath mad eschaunge of Antenor and yow, That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste. But how this cas doth Troilus moleste, That may non erthely mannes tonge seye; For verray wo his wit is al aweye. 127 For which we han so sorwed, he and I, That in-to litel bothe it hadde us slawe; But thurgh my conseil this day, fynally, He somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe. And semeth me that he desyreth fawe With yow to been al night, for to devyse Remede in this, if ther were any wyse. 128 This, short and pleyne, theffect of my message, As ferforth as my wit can comprehende. For ye, that been of torment in swich rage, May to no long prologe as now entende; And her-upon ye may answere him sende. And, for the love of god, my nece dere, So leef this wo er Troilus be here.’ 129 ‘Gret is my wo,’ quod she, and sighte sore, As she that feleth dedly sharp distresse; ‘But yet to me his sorwe is muchel more, That love him bet than he him-self, I gesse. Allas! for me hath he swich hevinesse? Can he for me so pitously compleyne? Y-wis, this sorwe doubleth al my peyne. 130 Grevous to me, god wot, is for to twinne,’ Quod she, ‘but yet it hardere is to me To seen that sorwe which that he is inne; For wel wot I, it wol my bane be; And deye I wol in certayn,’ tho quod she; ‘But bidde him come, er deeth, that thus me threteth, Dryve out that goost, which in myn herte beteth.’ 131 Thise wordes seyd, she on hir armes two Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously. Quod Pandarus, ‘allas! why do ye so, Syn wel ye wot the tyme is faste by, That he shal come? Arys up hastely, That he yow nat biwopen thus ne finde, But ye wol han him wood out of his minde! 132 For wiste he that ye ferde in this manere, He wolde him-selve slee; and if I wende To han this fare, he sholde not come here For al the good that Pryam may despende. For to what fyn he wolde anoon pretende, That knowe I wel; and for-thy yet I seye, So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye. 133 And shapeth yow his sorwe for to abregge, And nought encresse, leve nece swete; Beth rather to him cause of flat than egge, And with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete. What helpeth it to wepen ful a strete, Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte? Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte. 134 I mene thus; whan I him hider bringe, Sin ye ben wyse, and bothe of oon assent, So shapeth how distourbe your goinge, Or come ayen, sone after ye be went. Wommen ben wyse in short avysement; And lat sen how your wit shal now avayle; And what that I may helpe, it shal not fayle.’ 135 ‘Go,’ quod Criseyde, ‘and uncle, trewely, I shal don al my might, me to restreyne From weping in his sight, and bisily, Him for to glade, I shal don al my peyne, And in myn herte seken every veyne; If to this soor ther may be founden salve, It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.’ 136 Goth Pandarus, and Troilus he soughte, Til in a temple he fond him allone, As he that of his lyf no lenger roughte; But to the pitouse goddes everichone Ful tendrely he preyde, and made his mone, To doon him sone out of this world to pace; For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace. 137 And shortly, al the sothe for to seye, He was so fallen in despeyr that day, That outrely he shoop him for to deye. For right thus was his argument alwey: He seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey! ‘For al that comth, comth by necessitee; Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee. 138 For certaynly, this wot I wel,’ he seyde, That for-sight of divyne purveyaunce Hath seyn alwey me to for-gon Criseyde, Sin god seeth every thing, out of doutaunce, And hem desponeth, thourgh his ordenaunce, In hir merytes sothly for to be, As they shul comen by predestinee. 139 But nathelees, allas! whom shal I leve? For ther ben grete clerkes many oon, That destinee thorugh argumentes preve; And som men seyn that nedely ther is noon; But that free chois is yeven us everichoon. O, welaway! so sleye arn clerkes olde, That I not whos opinion I may holde. 140 For som men seyn, if god seth al biforn, Ne god may not deceyved ben, pardee, Than moot it fallen, though men hadde it sworn, That purveyaunce hath seyn bifore to be. Wherfor I seye, that from eterne if he Hath wist biforn our thought eek as our dede, We have no free chois, as these clerkes rede. 141 For other thought nor other dede also Might never be, but swich as purveyaunce, Which may not ben deceyved never-mo, Hath feled biforn, with-outen ignoraunce. For if ther mighte been a variaunce To wrythen out fro goddes purveyinge, Ther nere no prescience of thing cominge; 142 But it were rather an opinioun Uncerteyn, and no stedfast forseinge; And certes, that were an abusioun, That god shuld han no parfit cleer witinge More than we men that han doutous weninge. But swich an errour up-on god to gesse Were fals and foul, and wikked corsednesse. 143 Eek this is an opinioun of somme That han hir top ful heighe and smothe y-shore; They seyn right thus, that thing is not to come For that the prescience hath seyn bifore That it shal come; but they seyn, that therfore That it shal come, therfore the purveyaunce Wot it biforn with-outen ignoraunce; 144 And in this manere this necessitee Retorneth in his part contrarie agayn. For needfully bihoveth it not to be That thilke thinges fallen in certayn That ben purveyed; but nedely, as they seyn, Bihoveth it that thinges, whiche that falle, That they in certayn ben purveyed alle. 145 I mene as though I laboured me in this, To enqueren which thing cause of which thing be; As whether that the prescience of god is The certayn cause of the necessitee Of thinges that to comen been, pardee; Or if necessitee of thing cominge Be cause certeyn of the purveyinge. 146 But now ne enforce I me nat in shewinge How the ordre of causes stant; but wel wot I, That it bihoveth that the bifallinge Of thinges wist biforen certeynly Be necessarie, al seme it not ther-by That prescience put falling necessaire To thing to come, al falle it foule or faire. 147 For if ther sit a man yond on a see, Than by necessitee bihoveth it That, certes, thyn opinioun soth be, That wenest or coniectest that he sit; And ferther-over now ayenward yit, Lo, right so it is of the part contrarie, As thus; (now herkne, for I wol not tarie): 148 I seye, that if the opinioun of thee Be sooth, for that he sit, than seye I this, That he mot sitten by necessitee; And thus necessitee in either is. For in him nede of sitting is, y-wis, And in thee nede of sooth; and thus, forsothe, Ther moot necessitee ben in yow bothe. 149 But thou mayst seyn, the man sit not therfore, That thyn opinion of sitting soth is; But rather, for the man sit ther bifore, Therfore is thyn opinion sooth, y-wis. And I seye, though the cause of sooth of this Comth of his sitting, yet necessitee Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee. 150 Thus on this same wyse, out of doutaunce, I may wel maken, as it semeth me, My resoninge of goddes purveyaunce, And of the thinges that to comen be; By whiche reson men may wel y-see, That thilke thinges that in erthe falle, That by necessitee they comen alle. 151 For al-though that, for thing shal come, y-wis, Therfore is it purveyed, certaynly, Nat that it comth for it purveyed is: Yet nathelees, bihoveth it nedfully, That thing to come be purveyed, trewely; Or elles, thinges that purveyed be, That they bityden by necessitee. 152 And this suffyseth right y-now, certeyn, For to destroye our free chois every del.— But now is this abusion to seyn, That fallinge of the thinges temporel Is cause of goddes prescience eternel. Now trewely, that is a fals sentence, That thing to come sholde cause his prescience. 153 What mighte I wene, and I hadde swich a thought, But that god purveyth thing that is to come For that it is to come, and elles nought? So mighte I wene that thinges alle and some, That whylom been bifalle and over-come, Ben cause of thilke sovereyn purveyaunce, That for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce. 154 And over al this, yet seye I more herto, That right as whan I woot ther is a thing, Y-wis, that thing mot nedefully be so; Eek right so, whan I woot a thing coming, So mot it come; and thus the bifalling Of thinges that ben wist bifore the tyde, They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.’ 155 Than seyde he thus, ‘almighty Iove in trone, That wost of al this thing the soothfastnesse, Rewe on my sorwe, or do me deye sone, Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.’ And whyl he was in al this hevinesse, Disputinge with him-self in this matere, Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here. 156 ‘O mighty god,’ quod Pandarus, ‘in trone, Ey! who seigh ever a wys man faren so? Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done? Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo? What, parde, yet is not Criseyde a-go! Why lust thee so thy-self for-doon for drede, That in thyn heed thyn eyen semen dede? 157 Hastow not lived many a yeer biforn With-outen hir, and ferd ful wel at ese? Artow for hir and for non other born? Hath kinde thee wroughte al-only hir to plese? Lat be, and thenk right thus in thy disese. That, in the dees right as ther fallen chaunces, Right so in love, ther come and goon plesaunces. 158 And yet this is a wonder most of alle, Why thou thus sorwest, sin thou nost not yit, Touching hir goinge, how that it shal falle, Ne if she can hir-self distorben it. Thou hast not yet assayed al hir wit. A man may al by tyme his nekke bede Whan it shal of, and sorwen at the nede. 159 For-thy take hede of that that I shal seye; I have with hir y-spoke and longe y-be, So as accorded was bitwixe us tweye. And ever-mo me thinketh thus, that she Hath som-what in hir hertes prevetee, Wher-with she can, if I shal right arede, Distorbe al this, of which thou art in drede. 160 For which my counseil is, whan it is night, Thou to hir go, and make of this an ende; And blisful Iuno, thourgh hir grete mighte, Shal, as I hope, hir grace un-to us sende. Myn herte seyth, “certeyn, she shal not wende;” And for-thy put thyn herte a whyle in reste; And hold this purpos, for it is the beste.’ 161 This Troilus answerde, and sighte sore, ‘Thou seyst right wel, and I wil do right so;’ And what him liste, he seyde un-to it more. And whan that it was tyme for to go, Ful prevely him-self, with-outen mo, Un-to hir com, as he was wont to done; And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone. 162 Soth is, that whan they gonne first to mete, So gan the peyne hir hertes for to twiste, That neither of hem other mighte grete, But hem in armes toke and after kiste. The lasse wofulle of hem bothe niste Wher that he was, ne mighte o word out-bringe, As I seyde erst, for wo and for sobbinge. 163 Tho woful teres that they leten falle As bittre weren, out of teres kinde, For peyne, as is ligne aloës or galle. So bittre teres weep nought, as I finde, The woful Myrra through the bark and rinde. That in this world ther nis so hard an herte, That nolde han rewed on hir peynes smerte. 164 But whan hir woful wery gostes tweyne Retorned been ther-as hem oughte dwelle, And that som-what to wayken gan the peyne By lengthe of pleynte, and ebben gan the welle Of hire teres, and the herte unswelle, With broken voys, al hoors for-shright, Criseyde To Troilus thise ilke wordes seyde: 165 ‘O Iove, I deye, and mercy I beseche! Help, Troilus!’ and ther-with-al hir face Upon his brest she leyde, and loste speche; Hir woful spirit from his propre place, Right with the word, alwey up poynt to pace. And thus she lyth with hewes pale and grene, That whylom fresh and fairest was to sene. 166 This Troilus, that on hir gan biholde, Clepinge hir name, (and she lay as for deed, With-oute answere, and felte hir limes colde, Hir eyen throwen upward to hir heed), This sorwful man can now noon other reed, But ofte tyme hir colde mouth he kiste; Wher him was wo, god and him-self it wiste! 167 He rist him up, and long streight he hir leyde; For signe of lyf, for ought he can or may, Can he noon finde in no-thing on Criseyde, For which his song ful ofte is ‘weylaway!’ But whan he saugh that specheles she lay, With sorwful voys, and herte of blisse al bare, He seyde how she was fro this world y-fare! 168 So after that he longe hadde hir compleyned, His hondes wrong, and seyde that was to seye, And with his teres salte hir brest bireyned, He gan tho teris wypen of ful dreye, And pitously gan for the soule preye, And seyde, ‘O lord, that set art in thy trone, Rewe eek on me, for I shal folwe hir sone!’ 169 She cold was and with-outen sentement, For aught he woot, for breeth ne felte he noon; And this was him a preignant argument That she was forth out of this world agoon; And whan he seigh ther was non other woon, He gan hir limes dresse in swich manere As men don hem that shul be leyd on bere. 170 And after this, with sterne and cruel herte, His swerd a-noon out of his shethe he twighte, Him-self to sleen, how sore that him smerte, So that his sowle hir sowle folwen mighte, Ther-as the doom of Mynos wolde it dighte; Sin love and cruel Fortune it ne wolde, That in this world he lenger liven sholde. 171 Thanne seyde he thus, fulfild of heigh desdayn, ‘O cruel Iove, and thou, Fortune adverse, This al and som, that falsly have ye slayn Criseyde, and sin ye may do me no werse, Fy on your might and werkes so diverse! Thus cowardly ye shul me never winne; Ther shal no deeth me fro my lady twinne. 172 For I this world, sin ye han slayn hir thus, Wol lete, and folowe hir spirit lowe or hye; Shal never lover seyn that Troilus Dar not, for fere, with his lady dye; For certeyn, I wol bere hir companye. But sin ye wol not suffre us liven here, Yet suffreth that our soules ben y-fere. 173 And thou, citee, whiche that I leve in wo, And thou, Pryam, and bretheren al y-fere, And thou, my moder, farewel! for I go; And Attropos, make redy thou my bere! And thou, Criseyde, o swete herte dere, Receyve now my spirit!’ wolde he seye, With swerd at herte, al redy for to deye. 174 But as god wolde, of swough ther-with she abreyde, And gan to syke, and ‘Troilus’ she cryde; And he answerde, ‘lady myn Criseyde, Live ye yet?’ and leet his swerd doun glyde. ‘Ye, herte myn, that thanked be Cupyde!’ Quod she, and ther-with-al she sore sighte; And he bigan to glade hir as he mighte; 175 Took hir in armes two, and kiste hir ofte, And hir to glade he dide al his entente; For which hir goost, that flikered ay on-lofte, In-to hir woful herte ayein it wente. But at the laste, as that hir eyen glente A-syde, anoon she gan his swerd aspye, As it lay bare, and gan for fere crye, 176 And asked him, why he it hadde out-drawe? And Troilus anoon the cause hir tolde, And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe. For which Criseyde up-on him gan biholde, And gan him in hir armes faste folde, And seyde, ‘O mercy, god, lo, which a dede! Allas! how neigh we were bothe dede! 177 Thanne if I ne hadde spoken, as grace was, Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?’ quod she. ‘Ye, douteless;’ and she answerde, ‘allas! For, by that ilke lord that made me, I nolde a forlong wey on-lyve han be, After your deeth, to han be crowned quene Of al the lond the sonne on shyneth shene. 178 But with this selve swerd, which that here is, My-selve I wolde have slayn!’—quod she tho; ‘But ho, for we han right y-now of this, And late us ryse and streight to bedde go, And therë lat vs speken of our wo. For, by the morter which that I see brenne, Knowe I ful wel that day is not fer henne.’ 179 Whan they were in hir bedde, in armes folde, Nought was it lyk tho nightes here-biforn; For pitously ech other gan biholde, As they that hadden al hir blisse y-lorn, Biwaylinge ay the day that they were born. Til at the last this sorwful wight Criseyde To Troilus these ilke wordes seyde:— 180 ‘Lo, herte myn, wel wot ye this,’ quod she, ‘That if a wight alwey his wo compleyne, And seketh nought how holpen for to be, It nis but folye and encrees of peyne; And sin that here assembled be we tweyne To finde bote of wo that we ben inne, It were al tyme sone to biginne. 181 I am a womman, as ful wel ye woot, And as I am avysed sodeynly, So wol I telle yow, whyl it is hoot. Me thinketh thus, that neither ye nor I Oughte half this wo to make skilfully. For there is art y-now for to redresse That yet is mis, and sleen this hevinesse. 182 Sooth is, the wo, the whiche that we ben inne, For ought I woot, for no-thing elles is But for the cause that we sholden twinne. Considered al, ther nis no-more amis. But what is thanne a remede un-to this, But that we shape us sone for to mete? This al and som, my dere herte swete. 183 Now that I shal wel bringen it aboute To come ayein, sone after that I go, Ther-of am I no maner thing in doute. For dredeles, with-inne a wouke or two, I shal ben here; and, that it may be so By alle right, and in a wordes fewe, I shal yow wel an heep of weyes shewe. 184 For which I wol not make long sermoun, For tyme y-lost may not recovered be; But I wol gon to my conclusioun, And to the beste, in ought that I can see. And, for the love of god, for-yeve it me If I speke ought ayein your hertes reste; For trewely, I speke it for the beste; 185 Makinge alwey a protestacioun, That now these wordes, whiche that I shal seye, Nis but to shewe yow my mocioun, To finde un-to our helpe the beste weye; And taketh it non other wyse, I preye. For in effect what-so ye me comaunde, That wol I doon, for that is no demaunde. 186 Now herkeneth this, ye han wel understonde My goinge graunted is by parlement So ferforth, that it may not be with-stonde For al this world, as by my Iugement. And sin ther helpeth noon avysement To letten it, lat it passe out of minde; And lat us shape a bettre wey to finde. 187 The sothe is, that the twinninge of us tweyne Wol us disese and cruelliche anoye. But him bihoveth som-tyme han a peyne That serveth love, if that he wol have Ioye. And sin I shal no ferthere out of Troye Than I may ryde ayein on half a morwe, It oughte lasse causen us to sorwe. 188 So as I shal not so ben hid in muwe, That day by day, myn owene herte dere, Sin wel ye woot that it is now a truwe, Ye shul ful wel al myn estat y-here. And er that truwe is doon, I shal ben here, And thanne have ye bothe Antenor y-wonne And me also; beth glad now, if ye conne; 189 And thenk right thus, “Criseyde is now agoon, But what! she shal come hastely ayeyn;” And whanne, allas? by god, lo, right anoon, Er dayes ten, this dar I saufly seyn. And thanne at erste shul we been so fayn, So as we shulle to-gederes ever dwelle, Thal al this world ne mighte our blisse telle. 190 I see that ofte, ther-as we ben now, That for the beste, our conseil for to hyde, Ye speke not with me, nor I with yow In fourtenight; ne see yow go ne ryde. May ye not ten dayes thanne abyde, For myn honour, in swich an aventure? Y-wis, ye mowen elles lite endure! 191 Ye knowe eek how that al my kin is here, But-if that onliche it my fader be; And eek myn othere thinges alle y-fere, And nameliche, my dere herte, ye, Whom that I nolde leven for to see For al this world, as wyd as it hath space; Or elles, see ich never Ioves face! 192 Why trowe ye my fader in this wyse Coveiteth so to see me, but for drede Lest in this toun that folkes me dispyse By-cause of him, for his unhappy dede? What woot my fader what lyf that I lede? For if he wiste in Troye how wel I fare, Us neded for my wending nought to care. 193 Ye seen that every day eek, more and more, Men trete of pees; and it supposed is, That men the quene Eleyne shal restore, And Grekes us restore that is mis. So though ther nere comfort noon but this, That men purposen pees on every syde, Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde. 194 For if that it be pees, myn herte dere, The nature of the pees mot nedes dryve That men moste entrecomunen y-fere, And to and fro eek ryde and gon as blyve Alday as thikke as been flen from an hyve; And every wight han libertee to bleve Wher-as him list the bet, with-outen leve. 195 And though so be that pees ther may be noon, Yet hider, though ther never pees ne were, I moste come; for whider sholde I goon, Or how mischaunce sholde I dwelle there Among tho men of armes ever in fere? For which, as wisly god my soule rede, I can not seen wher-of ye sholden drede. 196 Have here another wey, if it so be That al this thing ne may yow not suffyse. My fader, as ye knowen wel, pardee, Is old, and elde is ful of coveityse. And I right now have founden al the gyse, With-oute net, wher-with I shal him hente; And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente. 197 Lo, Troilus, men seyn that hard it is The wolf ful, and the wether hool to have; This is to seyn, that men ful ofte, y-wis, Mot spenden part, the remenaunt for to save. For ay with gold men may the herte grave Of him that set is up-on coveityse; And how I mene, I shal it yow devyse. 198 The moeble which that I have in this toun Un-to my fader shal I take, and seye, That right for trust and for savacioun It sent is from a freend of his or tweye, The whiche freendes ferventliche him preye To senden after more, and that in hye, Whyl that this toun stant thus in Iupartye. 199 And that shal been an huge quantitee, Thus shal I seyn, but, lest it folk aspyde, This may be sent by no wight but by me; I shal eek shewen him, if pees bityde, What frendes that ich have on every syde Toward the court, to doon the wrathe pace Of Priamus, and doon him stonde in grace. 200 So, what for o thing and for other, swete, I shal him so enchaunten with my sawes, That right in hevene his sowle is, shal he mete! For al Appollo, or his clerkes lawes, Or calculinge avayleth nought three hawes; Desyr of gold shal so his sowle blende, That, as me lyst, I shal wel make an ende. 201 And if he wolde ought by his sort it preve If that I lye, in certayn I shal fonde Distorben him, and plukke him by the sleve, Makinge his sort, and beren him on honde, He hath not wel the goddes understonde. For goddes speken in amphibologyes, And, for a sooth, they tellen twenty lyes. 202 Eek drede fond first goddes, I suppose, Thus shal I seyn, and that his cowarde herte Made him amis the goddes text to glose, Whan he for ferde out of his Delphos sterte. And but I make him sone to converte, And doon my reed with-inne a day or tweye, I wol to yow oblige me to deye.’ 203 And treweliche, as writen wel I finde, That al this thing was seyd of good entente; And that hir herte trewe was and kinde Towardes him, and spak right as she mente, And that she starf for wo neigh, whan she wente, And was in purpos ever to be trewe; Thus writen they that of hir werkes knewe. 204 This Troilus, with herte and eres spradde, Herde al this thing devysen to and fro; And verraylich him semed that he hadde The selve wit; but yet to lete hir go His herte misforyaf him ever-mo. But fynally, he gan his herte wreste To trusten hir, and took it for the beste. 205 For which the grete furie of his penaunce Was queynt with hope, and ther-with hem bitwene Bigan for Ioye the amorouse daunce. And as the briddes, whan the sonne is shene, Delyten in hir song in leves grene, Right so the wordes that they spake y-fere Delyted hem, and made hir hertes clere. 206 But natheles, the wending of Criseyde, For al this world, may nought out of his minde; For which ful ofte he pitously hir preyde, That of hir heste he might hir trewe finde. And seyde hir, ‘certes, if ye be unkinde, And but ye come at day set in-to Troye, Ne shal I never have hele, honour, ne Ioye. 207 For al-so sooth as sonne up-rist on morwe, And, god! so wisly thou me, woful wrecche, To reste bringe out of this cruel sorwe, I wol my-selven slee if that ye drecche. But of my deeth though litel be to recche, Yet, er that ye me cause so to smerte, Dwel rather here, myn owene swete herte! 208 For trewely, myn owene lady dere, Tho sleightes yet that I have herd yow stere Ful shaply been to failen alle y-fere. For thus men seyn, “that oon thenketh the bere, But al another thenketh his ledere.” Your sire is wys, and seyd is, out of drede, “Men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede.” 209 It is ful hard to halten unespyed Bifore a crepul, for he can the craft; Your fader is in sleighte as Argus yëd; For al be that his moeble is him biraft, His olde sleighte is yet so with him laft, Ye shal not blende him for your womanhede, Ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede. 210 I noot if pees shal ever-mo bityde; But, pees or no, for ernest ne for game, I woot, sin Calkas on the Grekes syde Hath ones been, and lost so foule his name, He dar no more come here ayein for shame; For which that weye, for ought I can espye, To trusten on, nis but a fantasye. 211 Ye shal eek seen, your fader shal yow glose To been a wyf, and as he can wel preche, He shal som Grek so preyse and wel alose, That ravisshen he shal yow with his speche, Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche. And Troilus, of whom ye nil han routhe, Shal causeles so sterven in his trouthe! 212 And over al this, your fader shal despyse Us alle, and seyn this citee nis but lorn; And that thassege never shal aryse, For-why the Grekes han it alle sworn Til we be slayn, and doun our walles torn. And thus he shal you with his wordes fere, That ay drede I, that ye wol bleve there. 213 Ye shul eek seen so many a lusty knight A-mong the Grekes, ful of worthinesse, And eche of hem with herte, wit, and might To plesen yow don al his besinesse, That ye shul dullen of the rudenesse Of us sely Troianes, but-if routhe Remorde yow, or vertue of your trouthe. 214 And this to me so grevous is to thinke, That fro my brest it wol my soule rende; Ne dredeles, in me ther may not sinke A good opinioun, if that ye wende; For-why your faderes sleighte wol us shende. And if ye goon, as I have told yow yore, So thenk I nam but deed, with-oute more. 215 For which, with humble, trewe, and pitous herte, A thousand tymes mercy I yow preye; So reweth on myn aspre peynes smerte, And doth somwhat, as that I shal yow seye, And lat us stele away bitwixe us tweye; And thenk that folye is, whan man may chese, For accident his substaunce ay to lese. 216 I mene this, that sin we mowe er day Wel stele away, and been to-gider so, What wit were it to putten in assay, In cas ye sholden to your fader go, If that ye mighte come ayein or no? Thus mene I, that it were a gret folye To putte that sikernesse in Iupartye. 217 And vulgarly to speken of substaunce Of tresour, may we bothe with us lede Y-nough to live in honour and plesaunce, Til in-to tyme that we shul ben dede; And thus we may eschewen al this drede. For everich other wey ye can recorde, Myn herte, y-wis, may not ther-with acorde. 218 And hardily, ne dredeth no poverte, For I have kin and freendes elles-where That, though we comen in our bare sherte, Us sholde neither lakke gold ne gere, But been honoured whyl we dwelten there. And go we anoon, for, as in myn entente, This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.’ 219 Criseyde, with a syk, right in this wyse Answerde, ‘y-wis, my dere herte trewe, We may wel stele away, as ye devyse, And finde swiche unthrifty weyes newe; But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe. And help me god so at my moste nede As causeles ye suffren al this drede! 220 For thilke day that I for cherisshinge Or drede of fader, or of other wight, Or for estat, delyt, or for weddinge Be fals to yow, my Troilus, my knight, Saturnes doughter, Iuno, thorugh hir might, As wood as Athamante do me dwelle Eternaly in Stix, the put of helle! 221 And this on every god celestial I swere it yow, and eek on eche goddesse, On every Nymphe and deite infernal, On Satiry and Fauny more and lesse, That halve goddes been of wildernesse; And Attropos my threed of lyf to-breste If I be fals; now trowe me if thow leste! 222 And thou, Simoys, that as an arwe clere Thorugh Troye rennest ay downward to the see, Ber witnesse of this word that seyd is here, That thilke day that ich untrewe be To Troilus, myn owene herte free, That thou retorne bakwarde to thy welle, And I with body and soule sinke in helle! 223 But that ye speke, awey thus for to go And leten alle your freendes, god for-bede, For any womman, that ye sholden so, And namely, sin Troye hath now swich nede Of help; and eek of o thing taketh hede, If this were wist, my lif laye in balaunce, And your honour; god shilde us fro mischaunce! 224 And if so be that pees her-after take, As alday happeth, after anger, game, Why, lord! the sorwe and wo ye wolden make, That ye ne dorste come ayein for shame! And er that ye Iuparten so your name, Beth nought to hasty in this hote fare; For hasty man ne wanteth never care. 225 What trowe ye the peple eek al aboute Wolde of it seye? It is ful light to arede. They wolden seye, and swere it, out of doute, That love ne droof yow nought to doon this dede, But lust voluptuous and coward drede. Thus were al lost, y-wis, myn herte dere, Your honour, which that now shyneth so clere. 226 And also thenketh on myn honestee, That floureth yet, how foule I sholde it shende, And with what filthe it spotted sholde be, If in this forme I sholde with yow wende. Ne though I livede un-to the worldes ende, My name sholde I never ayeinward winne; Thus were I lost, and that were routhe and sinne. 227 And for-thy slee with reson al this hete; Men seyn, “the suffraunt overcometh,” pardee; Eek “who-so wol han leef, he leef mot lete;” Thus maketh vertue of necessitee By pacience, and thenk that lord is he Of fortune ay, that nought wol of hir recche; And she ne daunteth no wight but a wrecche. 228 And trusteth this, that certes, herte swete, Er Phebus suster, Lucina the shene, The Leoun passe out of this Ariete, I wol ben here, with-outen any wene. I mene, as helpe me Iuno, hevenes quene, The tenthe day, but-if that deeth me assayle, I wol yow seen, with-outen any fayle.’ 229 ‘And now, so this be sooth,’ quod Troilus, ‘I shal wel suffre un-to the tenthe day, Sin that I see that nede it moot be thus. But, for the love of god, if it be may, So lat us stele prively away; For ever in oon, as for to live in reste, Myn herte seyth that it wol been the beste.’ 230 ‘O mercy, god, what lyf is this?’ quod she; ‘Allas, ye slee me thus for verray tene! I see wel now that ye mistrusten me; For by your wordes it is wel y-sene. Now, for the love of Cynthia the shene, Mistrust me not thus causeles, for routhe; Sin to be trewe I have yow plight my trouthe. 231 And thenketh wel, that som tyme it is wit To spende a tyme, a tyme for to winne; Ne, pardee, lorn am I nought fro yow yit, Though that we been a day or two a-twinne. Dryf out the fantasyes yow with-inne; And trusteth me, and leveth eek your sorwe, Or here my trouthe, I wol not live til morwe. 232 For if ye wiste how sore it doth me smerte, Ye wolde cesse of this; for god, thou wost, The pure spirit wepeth in myn herte, To see yow wepen that I love most, And that I moot gon to the Grekes ost. Ye, nere it that I wiste remedye To come ayein, right here I wolde dye! 233 But certes, I am not so nyce a wight That I ne can imaginen a way To come ayein that day that I have hight. For who may holde thing that wol a-way? My fader nought, for al his queynte pley. And by my thrift, my wending out of Troye Another day shal torne us alle to Ioye. 234 For-thy, with al myn herte I yow beseke, If that yow list don ought for my preyere, And for the love which that I love yow eke, That er that I departe fro yow here, That of so good a comfort and a chere I may you seen, that ye may bringe at reste Myn herte, which that is at point to breste. 235 And over al this, I pray yow,’ quod she tho, ‘Myn owene hertes soothfast suffisaunce, Sin I am thyn al hool, with-outen mo, That whyl that I am absent, no plesaunce Of othere do me fro your remembraunce. For I am ever a-gast, for-why men rede, That “love is thing ay ful of bisy drede.” 236 For in this world ther liveth lady noon, If that ye were untrewe, as god defende! That so bitraysed were or wo bigoon As I, that alle trouthe in yow entende. And douteles, if that ich other wende, I nere but deed; and er ye cause finde, For goddes love, so beth me not unkinde.’ 237 To this answerde Troilus and seyde, ‘Now god, to whom ther nis no cause y-wrye, Me glade, as wis I never un-to Criseyde, Sin thilke day I saw hir first with yë, Was fals, ne never shal til that I dye. At shorte wordes, wel ye may me leve; I can no more, it shal be founde at preve.’ 238 ‘Graunt mercy, goode myn, y-wis,’ quod she, ‘And blisful Venus lat me never sterve Er I may stonde of plesaunce in degree To quyte him wel, that so wel can deserve; And whyl that god my wit wol me conserve, I shal so doon, so trewe I have yow founde, That ay honour to me-ward shal rebounde. 239 For trusteth wel, that your estat royal Ne veyn delyt, nor only worthinesse Of yow in werre, or torney marcial, Ne pompe, array, nobley, or eek richesse, Ne made me to rewe on your distresse; But moral vertue, grounded upon trouthe, That was the cause I first hadde on yow routhe! 240 Eek gentil herte and manhod that ye hadde, And that ye hadde, as me thoughte, in despyt Every thing that souned in-to badde, As rudenesse and poeplish appetyt; And that your reson brydled your delyt, This made, aboven every creature, That I was your, and shal, whyl I may dure. 241 And this may lengthe of yeres not for-do, Ne remuable fortune deface; But Iuppiter, that of his might may do The sorwful to be glad, so yeve us grace, Er nightes ten, to meten in this place, So that it may your herte and myn suffyse; And fareth now wel, for tyme is that ye ryse.’ 242 And after that they longe y-pleyned hadde, And ofte y-kist and streite in armes folde, The day gan ryse, and Troilus him cladde, And rewfulliche his lady gan biholde, As he that felte dethes cares colde. And to hir grace he gan him recomaunde; Wher him was wo, this holde I no demaunde. 243 For mannes heed imaginen ne can, Ne entendement considere, ne tonge telle The cruel peynes of this sorwful man, That passen every torment doun in helle. For whan he saugh that she ne mighte dwelle, Which that his soule out of his herte rente, With-outen more, out of the chaumbre he wente. Explicit Liber Quartus. BOOK V. Incipit Liber Quintus. 1 Aprochen gan the fatal destinee That Ioves hath in disposicioun, And to yow, angry Parcas, sustren three, Committeth, to don execucioun; For which Criseyde moste out of the toun, And Troilus shal dwelle forth in pyne Til Lachesis his threed no lenger twyne.— 2 The golden-tressed Phebus heighe on-lofte Thryës hadde alle with his bemes shene The snowes molte, and Zephirus as ofte Y-brought ayein the tendre leves grene, Sin that the sone of Ecuba the quene Bigan to love hir first, for whom his sorwe Was al, that she departe sholde a-morwe. 3 Ful redy was at pryme Dyomede, Criseyde un-to the Grekes ost to lede, For sorwe of which she felte hir herte blede, As she that niste what was best to rede. And trewely, as men in bokes rede, Men wiste never womman han the care, Ne was so looth out of a toun to fare. 4 This Troilus, with-outen reed or lore, As man that hath his Ioyes eek forlore, Was waytinge on his lady ever-more As she that was the soothfast crop and more Of al his lust, or Ioyes here-tofore. But Troilus, now farewel al thy Ioye, For shaltow never seen hir eft in Troye! 5 Soth is, that whyl he bood in this manere, He gan his wo ful manly for to hyde, That wel unnethe it seen was in his chere; But at the yate ther she sholde oute ryde With certeyn folk, he hoved hir tabyde, So wo bigoon, al wolde he nought him pleyne, That on his hors unnethe he sat for peyne. 6 For ire he quook, so gan his herte gnawe, Whan Diomede on horse gan him dresse, And seyde un-to him-self this ilke sawe, ‘Allas,’ quod he, ‘thus foul a wrecchednesse Why suffre ich it, why nil ich it redresse? Were it not bet at ones for to dye Than ever-more in langour thus to drye? 7 Why nil I make at ones riche and pore To have y-nough to done, er that she go? Why nil I bringe al Troye upon a rore? Why nil I sleen this Diomede also? Why nil I rather with a man or two Stele hir a-way? Why wol I this endure? Why nil I helpen to myn owene cure?’ 8 But why he nolde doon so fel a dede, That shal I seyn, and why him liste it spare: He hadde in herte alwey a maner drede, Lest that Criseyde, in rumour of this fare, Sholde han ben slayn; lo, this was al his care. And elles, certeyn, as I seyde yore, He hadde it doon, with-outen wordes more. 9 Criseyde, whan she redy was to ryde, Ful sorwfully she sighte, and seyde ‘allas!’ But forth she moot, for ought that may bityde, And forth she rit ful sorwfully a pas. Ther nis non other remedie in this cas. What wonder is though that hir sore smerte, Whan she forgoth hir owene swete herte? 10 This Troilus, in wyse of curteisye, With hauke on hond, and with an huge route Of knightes, rood and dide hir companye, Passinge al the valey fer with-oute. And ferther wolde han riden, out of doute, Ful fayn, and wo was him to goon so sone; But torne he moste, and it was eek to done. 11 And right with that was Antenor y-come Out of the Grekes ost, and every wight Was of it glad, and seyde he was wel-come. And Troilus, al nere his herte light, He peyned him with al his fulle might Him to with-holde of wepinge at the leste, And Antenor he kiste, and made feste. 12 And ther-with-al he moste his leve take, And caste his eye upon hir pitously, And neer he rood, his cause for to make, To take hir by the honde al sobrely. And lord! so she gan wepen tendrely! And he ful softe and sleighly gan hir seye, ‘Now hold your day, and dooth me not to deye.’ 13 With that his courser torned he a-boute With face pale, and un-to Diomede No word he spak, ne noon of al his route; Of which the sone of Tydeus took hede, As he that coude more than the crede In swich a craft, and by the reyne hir hente; And Troilus to Troye homwarde he wente. 14 This Diomede, that ladde hir by the brydel, Whan that he saw the folk of Troye aweye, Thoughte, ‘al my labour shal not been on ydel, If that I may, for somwhat shal I seye. For at the worste it may yet shorte our weye. I have herd seyd, eek tymes twyës twelve, “He is a fool that wol for-yete him-selve.”’ 15 But natheles this thoughte he wel ynough, ‘That certaynly I am aboute nought If that I speke of love, or make it tough; For douteles, if she have in hir thought Him that I gesse, he may not been y-brought So sone awey; but I shal finde a mene, That she not wite as yet shal what I mene.’ 16 This Diomede, as he that coude his good, Whan this was doon, gan fallen forth in speche Of this and that, and asked why she stood In swich disese, and gan hir eek biseche, That if that he encrese mighte or eche With any thing hir ese, that she sholde Comaunde it him, and seyde he doon it wolde. 17 For trewely he swoor hir, as a knight, That ther nas thing with whiche he mighte hir plese, That he nolde doon his peyne and al his might To doon it, for to doon hir herte an ese. And preyede hir, she wolde hir sorwe apese, And seyde, ‘y-wis, we Grekes con have Ioye To honouren yow, as wel as folk of Troye.’ 18 He seyde eek thus, ‘I woot, yow thinketh straunge, No wonder is, for it is to yow newe, Thaqueintaunce of these Troianes to chaunge, For folk of Grece, that ye never knewe. But wolde never god but-if as trewe A Greek ye shulde among us alle finde As any Troian is, and eek as kinde. 19 And by the cause I swoor yow right, lo, now, To been your freend, and helply, to my might, And for that more acqueintaunce eek of yow Have ich had than another straunger wight, So fro this forth I pray yow, day and night, Comaundeth me, how sore that me smerte, To doon al that may lyke un-to your herte; 20 And that ye me wolde as your brother trete, And taketh not my frendship in despyt; And though your sorwes be for thinges grete, Noot I not why, but out of more respyt, Myn herte hath for to amende it greet delyt. And if I may your harmes not redresse, I am right sory for your hevinesse. 21 And though ye Troians with us Grekes wrothe Han many a day be, alwey yet, pardee, O god of love in sooth we serven bothe. And, for the love of god, my lady free, Whom so ye hate, as beth not wroth with me. For trewely, ther can no wight yow serve, That half so looth your wraththe wolde deserve. 22 And nere it that we been so neigh the tente Of Calkas, which that seen us bothe may, I wolde of this yow telle al myn entente; But this enseled til another day. Yeve me your hond, I am, and shal ben ay, God help me so, whyl that my lyf may dure, Your owene aboven every creature. 23 Thus seyde I never er now to womman born; For god myn herte as wisly glade so, I lovede never womman here-biforn As paramours, ne never shal no mo. And, for the love of god, beth not my fo; Al can I not to yow, my lady dere, Compleyne aright, for I am yet to lere. 24 And wondreth not, myn owene lady bright, Though that I speke of love to you thus blyve; For I have herd or this of many a wight, Hath loved thing he never saugh his lyve. Eek I am not of power for to stryve Ayens the god of love, but him obeye I wol alwey, and mercy I yow preye. 25 Ther been so worthy knightes in this place And ye so fair, that everich of hem alle Wol peynen him to stonden in your grace. But mighte me so fair a grace falle, That ye me for your servaunt wolde calle, So lowly ne so trewely you serve Nil noon of hem, as I shal, til I sterve.’ 26 Criseide un-to that purpos lyte answerde, As she that was with sorwe oppressed so That, in effect, she nought his tales herde, But here and there, now here a word or two. Hir thoughte hir sorwful herte brast a-two. For whan she gan hir fader fer aspye, Wel neigh doun of hir hors she gan to sye. 27 But natheles she thonked Diomede Of al his travaile, and his goode chere, And that him liste his friendship hir to bede; And she accepteth it in good manere, And wolde do fayn that is him leef and dere; And trusten him she wolde, and wel she mighte, As seyde she, and from hir hors she alighte. 28 Hir fader hath hir in his armes nome, And tweynty tyme he kiste his doughter swete, And seyde, ‘O dere doughter myn, wel-come!’ She seyde eek, she was fayn with him to mete, And stood forth mewet, mildë, and mansuete. But here I leve hir with hir fader dwelle, And forth I wol of Troilus yow telle. 29 To Troye is come this woful Troilus, In sorwe aboven alle sorwes smerte, With felon look, and face dispitous. Tho sodeinly doun from his hors he sterte, And thorugh his paleys, with a swollen herte, To chambre he wente; of no-thing took he hede, Ne noon to him dar speke a word for drede. 30 And there his sorwes that he spared hadde He yaf an issue large, and ‘deeth!’ he cryde; And in his throwes frenetyk and madde He cursed Iove, Appollo, and eek Cupyde, He cursed Ceres, Bacus, and Cipryde, His burthe, him-self, his fate, and eek nature, And, save his lady, every creature. 31 To bedde he goth, and weyleth there and torneth In furie, as dooth he, Ixion, in helle; And in this wyse he neigh til day soiorneth. But tho bigan his herte a lyte unswelle Thorugh teres which that gonnen up to welle; And pitously he cryde up-on Criseyde, And to him-self right thus he spak, and seyde:— 32 ‘Wher is myn owene lady lief and dere, Wher is hir whyte brest, wher is it, where? Wher ben hir armes and hir eyen clere, That yesternight this tyme with me were? Now may I wepe allone many a tere, And graspe aboute I may, but in this place, Save a pilowe, I finde nought tenbrace. 33 How shal I do? Whan shal she com ayeyn? I noot, allas! why leet ich hir to go? As wolde god, ich hadde as tho be sleyn! O herte myn, Criseyde, O swete fo! O lady myn, that I love and no mo! To whom for ever-mo myn herte I dowe; See how I deye, ye nil me not rescowe! 34 Who seeth yow now, my righte lode-sterre? Who sit right now or stant in your presence? Who can conforten now your hertes werre? Now I am gon, whom yeve ye audience? Who speketh for me right now in myn absence? Allas, no wight; and that is al my care; For wel wot I, as yvel as I ye fare. 35 How shulde I thus ten dayes ful endure, Whan I the firste night have al this tene? How shal she doon eek, sorwful creature? For tendernesse, how shal she this sustene, Swich wo for me? O pitous, pale, and grene Shal been your fresshe wommanliche face For langour, er ye torne un-to this place.’ 36 And whan he fil in any slomeringes, Anoon biginne he sholde for to grone, And dremen of the dredfulleste thinges That mighte been; as, mete he were allone In place horrible, makinge ay his mone, Or meten that he was amonges alle His enemys, and in hir hondes falle. 37 And ther-with-al his body sholde sterte, And with the stert al sodeinliche awake, And swich a tremour fele aboute his herte, That of the feer his body sholde quake; And there-with-al he sholde a noyse make, And seme as though he sholde falle depe From heighe a-lofte; and than he wolde wepe, 38 And rewen on him-self so pitously, That wonder was to here his fantasye. Another tyme he sholde mightily Conforte him-self, and seyn it was folye, So causeles swich drede for to drye, And eft biginne his aspre sorwes newe, That every man mighte on his sorwes rewe. 39 Who coude telle aright or ful discryve His wo, his pleynte, his langour, and his pyne? Nought al the men that han or been on-lyve. Thou, redere, mayst thy-self ful wel devyne That swich a wo my wit can not defyne. On ydel for to wryte it sholde I swinke, Whan that my wit is wery it to thinke. 40 On hevene yet the sterres were sene, Al-though ful pale y-waxen was the mone; And whyten gan the orisonte shene Al estward, as it woned is to done. And Phebus with his rosy carte sone Gan after that to dresse him up to fare, Whan Troilus hath sent after Pandare. 41 This Pandare, that of al the day biforn Ne mighte have comen Troilus to see, Al-though he on his heed it hadde y-sworn, For with the king Pryam alday was he, So that it lay not in his libertee No-wher to gon, but on the morwe he wente To Troilus, whan that he for him sente. 42 For in his herte he coude wel devyne, That Troilus al night for sorwe wook; And that he wolde telle him of his pyne, This knew he wel y-nough, with-oute book. For which to chaumbre streight the wey he took, And Troilus tho sobreliche he grette, And on the bed ful sone he gan him sette. 43 ‘My Pandarus,’ quod Troilus, ‘the sorwe Which that I drye, I may not longe endure. I trowe I shal not liven til to-morwe; For whiche I wolde alwey, on aventure, To thee devysen of my sepulture The forme, and of my moeble thou dispone Right as thee semeth best is for to done. 44 But of the fyr and flaumbe funeral In whiche my body brenne shal to glede, And of the feste and pleyes palestral At my vigile, I pray thee take good hede That al be wel; and offre Mars my stede, My swerd, myn helm, and, leve brother dere, My sheld to Pallas yef, that shyneth clere. 45 The poudre in which myn herte y-brend shal torne, That preye I thee thou take and it conserve In a vessel, that men clepeth an urne, Of gold, and to my lady that I serve, For love of whom thus pitously I sterve, So yeve it hir, and do me this plesaunce, To preye hir kepe it for a remembraunce. 46 For wel I fele, by my maladye, And by my dremes now and yore ago, Al certeinly, that I mot nedes dye. The owle eek, which that hight Ascaphilo, Hath after me shright alle thise nightes two. And, god Mercurie! of me now, woful wrecche, The soule gyde, and, whan thee list, it fecche!’ 47 Pandare answerde, and seyde, ‘Troilus, My dere freend, as I have told thee yore, That it is folye for to sorwen thus, And causeles, for whiche I can no-more. But who-so wol not trowen reed ne lore, I can not seen in him no remedye, But lete him worthen with his fantasye. 48 But Troilus, I pray thee tel me now, If that thou trowe, er this, that any wight Hath loved paramours as wel as thou? Ye, god wot, and fro many a worthy knight Hath his lady goon a fourtenight, And he not yet made halvendel the fare. What nede is thee to maken al this care? 49 Sin day by day thou mayst thy-selven see That from his love, or elles from his wyf, A man mot twinnen of necessitee, Ye, though he love hir as his owene lyf; Yet nil he with him-self thus maken stryf. For wel thow wost, my leve brother dere, That alwey freendes may nought been y-fere. 50 How doon this folk that seen hir loves wedded By freendes might, as it bi-tit ful ofte, And seen hem in hir spouses bed y-bedded? God woot, they take it wysly, faire and softe. For-why good hope halt up hir herte on-lofte, And for they can a tyme of sorwe endure; As tyme hem hurt, a tyme doth hem cure. 51 So sholdestow endure, and late slyde The tyme, and fonde to ben glad and light. Ten dayes nis so longe not tabyde. And sin she thee to comen hath bihight, She nil hir hestes breken for no wight. For dred thee not that she nil finden weye To come ayein, my lyf that dorste I leye. 52 Thy swevenes eek and al swich fantasye Dryf out, and lat hem faren to mischaunce; For they procede of thy malencolye, That doth thee fele in sleep al this penaunce. A straw for alle swevenes signifiaunce! God helpe me so, I counte hem not a bene, Ther woot no man aright what dremes mene. 53 For prestes of the temple tellen this, That dremes been the revelaciouns Of goddes, and as wel they telle, y-wis, That they ben infernals illusiouns; And leches seyn, that of complexiouns Proceden they, or fast, or glotonye. Who woot in sooth thus what they signifye? 54 Eek othere seyn that thorugh impressiouns, As if a wight hath faste a thing in minde, That ther-of cometh swiche avisiouns; And othere seyn, as they in bokes finde, That, after tymes of the yeer by kinde, Men dreme, and that theffect goth by the mone; But leve no dreem, for it is nought to done. 55 Wel worth of dremes ay thise olde wyves, And treweliche eek augurie of thise foules; For fere of which men wenen lese her lyves, As ravenes qualm, or shryking of thise oules. To trowen on it bothe fals and foul is. Allas, allas, so noble a creature As is a man, shal drede swich ordure! 56 For which with al myn herte I thee beseche, Un-to thy-self that al this thou foryive; And rys up now with-oute more speche, And lat us caste how forth may best be drive This tyme, and eek how freshly we may live Whan that she cometh, the which shal be right sone; God help me so, the beste is thus to done. 57 Rys, lat us speke of lusty lyf in Troye That we han lad, and forth the tyme dryve; And eek of tyme cominge us reioye, That bringen shal our blisse now so blyve; And langour of these twyës dayes fyve We shal ther-with so foryete or oppresse, That wel unnethe it doon shal us duresse. 58 This toun is ful of lordes al aboute, And trewes lasten al this mene whyle. Go we pleye us in som lusty route To Sarpedon, not hennes but a myle. And thus thou shalt the tyme wel bigyle, And dryve it forth un-to that blisful morwe, That thou hir see, that cause is of thy sorwe. 59 Now rys, my dere brother Troilus; For certes, it noon honour is to thee To wepe, and in thy bed to iouken thus. For trewely, of o thing trust to me, If thou thus ligge a day, or two, or three, The folk wol wene that thou, for cowardyse, Thee feynest syk, and that thou darst not ryse.’ 60 This Troilus answerde, ‘O brother dere, This knowen folk that han y-suffred peyne, That though he wepe and make sorwful chere, That feleth harm and smert in every veyne, No wonder is; and though I ever pleyne, Or alwey wepe, I am no-thing to blame, Sin I have lost the cause of al my game. 61 But sin of fyne force I moot aryse, I shal aryse, as sone as ever I may; And god, to whom myn herte I sacrifyse, So sende us hastely the tenthe day! For was ther never fowl so fayn of May, As I shal been, whan that she cometh in Troye, That cause is of my torment and my Ioye. 62 But whider is thy reed,’ quod Troilus, ‘That we may pleye us best in al this toun?’ ‘By god, my conseil is,’ quod Pandarus, ‘To ryde and pleye us with king Sarpedoun.’ So longe of this they speken up and doun, Til Troilus gan at the laste assente To ryse, and forth to Sarpedoun they wente. 63 This Sarpedoun, as he that honourable Was ever his lyve, and ful of heigh prowesse, With al that mighte y-served been on table, That deyntee was, al coste it greet richesse, He fedde hem day by day, that swich noblesse, As seyden bothe the moste and eek the leste, Was never er that day wist at any feste. 64 Nor in this world ther is non instrument Delicious, through wind, or touche, or corde, As fer as any wight hath ever y-went, That tonge telle or herte may recorde, That at that feste it nas wel herd acorde; Ne of ladies eek so fayr a companye On daunce, er tho, was never y-seyn with yë. 65 But what avayleth this to Troilus, That for his sorwe no-thing of it roughte? For ever in oon his herte piëtous Ful bisily Criseyde his lady soughte. On hir was ever al that his herte thoughte. Now this, now that, so faste imagininge, That glade, y-wis, can him no festeyinge. 66 These ladies eek that at this feste been, Sin that he saw his lady was a-weye, It was his sorwe upon hem for to seen, Or for to here on instrumentz so pleye. For she, that of his herte berth the keye, Was absent, lo, this was his fantasye, That no wight sholde make melodye. 67 Nor ther nas houre in al the day or night, Whan he was ther-as no wight mighte him here, That he ne seyde, ‘O lufsom lady bright, How have ye faren, sin that ye were here? Wel-come, y-wis, myn owene lady dere.’ But welaway, al this nas but a mase; Fortune his howve entended bet to glase. 68 The lettres eek, that she of olde tyme Hadde him y-sent, he wolde allone rede, An hundred sythe, a-twixen noon and pryme; Refiguringe hir shap, hir womanhede, With-inne his herte, and every word and dede That passed was, and thus he droof to an ende The ferthe day, and seyde, he wolde wende. 69 And seyde, ‘leve brother Pandarus, Intendestow that we shul herë bleve Til Sarpedoun wol forth congeyen us? Yet were it fairer that we toke our leve. For goddes love, lat us now sone at eve Our leve take, and homward lat us torne; For trewely, I nil not thus soiorne.’ 70 Pandare answerde, ‘be we comen hider To fecchen fyr, and rennen hoom ayeyn? God helpe me so, I can not tellen whider We mighten goon, if I shal soothly seyn, Ther any wight is of us more fayn Than Sarpedoun; and if we hennes hye Thus sodeinly, I holde it vilanye, 71 Sin that we seyden that we wolde bleve With him a wouke; and now, thus sodeinly, The ferthe day to take of him our leve, He wolde wondren on it, trewely! Lat us holde forth our purpos fermely; And sin that ye bihighten him to byde, Hold forward now, and after lat us ryde.’ 72 Thus Pandarus, with alle peyne and wo, Made him to dwelle; and at the woukes ende, Of Sarpedoun they toke hir leve tho, And on hir wey they spedden hem to wende. Quod Troilus, ‘now god me grace sende, That I may finden, at myn hom-cominge, Criseyde comen!’ and ther-with gan he singe. 73 ‘Ye, hasel-wode!’ thoughte this Pandare, And to him-self ful softely he seyde, ‘God woot, refreyden may this hote fare Er Calkas sende Troilus Criseyde!’ But natheles, he Iaped thus, and seyde, And swor, y-wis, his herte him wel bihighte, She wolde come as sone as ever she mighte. 74 Whan they un-to the paleys were y-comen Of Troilus, they doun of hors alighte, And to the chambre hir wey than han they nomen. And in-to tyme that it gan to nighte, They spaken of Crisëyde the brighte. And after this, whan that hem bothe leste, They spedde hem fro the soper un-to reste. 75 On morwe, as sone as day bigan to clere, This Troilus gan of his sleep tabreyde, And to Pandare, his owene brother dere, ‘For love of god,’ ful pitously he seyde, ‘As go we seen the paleys of Criseyde; For sin we yet may have namore feste, So lat us seen hir paleys at the leste.’ 76 And ther-with-al, his meyne for to blende, A cause he fond in toune for to go, And to Criseydes hous they gonnen wende. But lord! this sely Troilus was wo! Him thoughte his sorweful herte braste a-two. For whan he saugh hir dores sperred alle, Wel neigh for sorwe a-doun he gan to falle. 77 Therwith whan he was war and gan biholde How shet was every windowe of the place, As frost, him thoughte, his herte gan to colde; For which with chaunged deedlich pale face, With-outen word, he forth bigan to pace; And, as god wolde, he gan so faste ryde, That no wight of his contenaunce aspyde. 78 Than seyde he thus, ‘O paleys desolat, O hous, of houses whylom best y-hight, O paleys empty and disconsolat, O thou lanterne, of which queynt is the light, O paleys, whylom day, that now art night, Wel oughtestow to falle, and I to dye, Sin she is went that wont was us to gye! 79 O paleys, whylom croune of houses alle, Enlumined with sonne of alle blisse! O ring, fro which the ruby is out-falle, O cause of wo, that cause hast been of lisse! Yet, sin I may no bet, fayn wolde I kisse Thy colde dores, dorste I for this route; And fare-wel shryne, of which the seynt is oute!’ 80 Ther-with he caste on Pandarus his yë With chaunged face, and pitous to biholde; And whan he mighte his tyme aright aspye, Ay as he rood, to Pandarus he tolde His newe sorwe, and eek his Ioyes olde, So pitously and with so dede an hewe, That every wight mighte on his sorwe rewe. 81 Fro thennesforth he rydeth up and doun, And every thing com him to remembraunce As he rood forth by places of the toun In whiche he whylom hadde al his plesaunce. ‘Lo, yond saugh I myn owene lady daunce; And in that temple, with hir eyen clere, Me caughte first my righte lady dere. 82 And yonder have I herd ful lustily My dere herte laughe, and yonder pleye Saugh I hir ones eek ful blisfully. And yonder ones to me gan she seye, “Now goode swete, love me wel, I preye.” And yond so goodly gan she me biholde, That to the deeth myn herte is to hir holde. 83 And at that corner, in the yonder hous, Herde I myn alderlevest lady dere So wommanly, with voys melodious, Singen so wel, so goodly, and so clere, That in my soule yet me thinketh I here The blisful soun; and, in that yonder place, My lady first me took un-to hir grace.’ 84 Thanne thoughte he thus, ‘O blisful lord Cupyde, Whanne I the proces have in my memorie, How thou me hast werreyed on every syde, Men mighte a book make of it, lyk a storie. What nede is thee to seke on me victorie, Sin I am thyn, and hoolly at thy wille? What Ioye hastow thyn owene folk to spille? 85 Wel hastow, lord, y-wroke on me thyn ire, Thou mighty god, and dredful for to greve! Now mercy, lord, thou wost wel I desire Thy grace most, of alle lustes leve. And live and deye I wol in thy bileve; For which I naxe in guerdon but a bone, That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone. 86 Distreyne hir herte as faste to retorne As thou dost myn to longen hir to see; Than woot I wel, that she nil not soiorne. Now, blisful lord, so cruel thou ne be Un-to the blood of Troye, I preye thee, As Iuno was un-to the blood Thebane, For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane.’ 87 And after this he to the yates wente Ther-as Criseyde out-rood a ful good paas, And up and doun ther made he many a wente, And to him-self ful ofte he seyde ‘allas! From hennes rood my blisse and my solas! As wolde blisful god now, for his Ioye; I mighte hir seen ayein come in-to Troye. 88 And to the yonder hille I gan hir gyde, Allas! and there I took of hir my leve! And yond I saugh hir to hir fader ryde, For sorwe of which myn herte shal to-cleve. And hider hoom I com whan it was eve; And here I dwelle out-cast from alle Ioye, And shal, til I may seen hir eft in Troye.’ 89 And of him-self imagined he ofte To ben defet, and pale, and waxen lesse Than he was wont, and that men seyde softe, ‘What may it be? who can the sothe gesse Why Troilus hath al this hevinesse?’ And al this nas but his malencolye, That he hadde of him-self swich fantasye. 90 Another tyme imaginen he wolde That every wight that wente by the weye Had of him routhe, and that they seyen sholde, ‘I am right sory Troilus wol deye.’ And thus he droof a day yet forth or tweye. As ye have herd, swich lyf right gan he lede, As he that stood bitwixen hope and drede. 91 For which him lyked in his songes shewe Thencheson of his wo, as he best mighte, And make a song of wordes but a fewe, Somwhat his woful herte for to lighte. And whan he was from every mannes sighte, With softe voys he, of his lady dere, That was absent, gan singe as ye may here. 92 ‘O sterre, of which I lost have al the light, With herte soor wel oughte I to bewayle, That ever derk in torment, night by night, Toward my deeth with wind in stere I sayle; For which the tenthe night if that I fayle The gyding of thy bemes brighte an houre, My ship and me Caribdis wol devoure.’ 93 This song when he thus songen hadde, sone He fil ayein in-to his sykes olde; And every night, as was his wone to done, He stood the brighte mone to beholde, And al his sorwe he to the mone tolde; And seyde, ‘y-wis, whan thou art horned newe, I shal be glad, if al the world be trewe! 94 I saugh thyn hornes olde eek by the morwe, Whan hennes rood my righte lady dere, That cause is of my torment and my sorwe; For whiche, O brighte Lucina the clere, For love of god, ren faste aboute thy spere! For whan thyn hornes newe ginne springe, Than shal she come, that may my blisse bringe!’ 95 The day is more, and lenger every night, Than they be wont to be, him thoughte tho; And that the sonne wente his course unright By lenger wey than it was wont to go; And seyde, ‘y-wis, me dredeth ever-mo, The sonnes sone, Pheton, be on-lyve, And that his fadres cart amis he dryve.’ 96 Upon the walles faste eek wolde he walke, And on the Grekes ost he wolde see, And to him-self right thus he wolde talke, ‘Lo, yonder is myn owene lady free, Or elles yonder, ther tho tentes be! And thennes comth this eyr, that is so sote, That in my soule I fele it doth me bote. 97 And hardely this wind, that more and more Thus stoundemele encreseth in my face, Is of my ladyes depe sykes sore. I preve it thus, for in non othere place Of al this toun, save onliche in this space, Fele I no wind that souneth so lyk peyne; It seyth, “allas! why twinned be we tweyne?”’ 98 This longe tyme he dryveth forth right thus, Til fully passed was the nynthe night; And ay bi-syde him was this Pandarus, That bisily dide alle his fulle might Him to comforte, and make his herte light; Yevinge him hope alwey, the tenthe morwe That she shal come, and stinten al his sorwe. 99 Up-on that other syde eek was Criseyde, With wommen fewe, among the Grekes stronge; For which ful ofte a day ‘allas!’ she seyde, ‘That I was born! Wel may myn herte longe After my deeth; for now live I to longe! Allas! and I ne may it not amende; For now is wors than ever yet I wende. 100 My fader nil for no-thing do me grace To goon ayein, for nought I can him queme; And if so be that I my terme passe, My Troilus shal in his herte deme That I am fals, and so it may wel seme. Thus shal I have unthank on every syde; That I was born, so weylawey the tyde! 101 And if that I me putte in Iupartye, To stele awey by nighte, and it bifalle That I be caught, I shal be holde a spye; Or elles, lo, this drede I most of alle, If in the hondes of som wrecche I falle, I am but lost, al be myn herte trewe; Now mighty god, thou on my sorwe rewe!’ 102 Ful pale y-waxen was hir brighte face, Hir limes lene, as she that al the day Stood whan she dorste, and loked on the place Ther she was born, and ther she dwelt hadde ay. And al the night wepinge, allas! she lay. And thus despeired, out of alle cure, She ladde hir lyf, this woful creature. 103 Ful ofte a day she sighte eek for destresse, And in hir-self she wente ay portrayinge Of Troilus the grete worthinesse, And alle his goodly wordes recordinge Sin first that day hir love bigan to springe. And thus she sette hir woful herte a-fyre Thorugh remembraunce of that she gan desyre. 104 In al this world ther nis so cruel herte That hir hadde herd compleynen in hir sorwe, That nolde han wopen for hir peynes smerte, So tendrely she weep, bothe eve and morwe. Hir nedede no teres for to borwe. And this was yet the worste of al hir peyne, Ther was no wight to whom she dorste hir pleyne. 105 Ful rewfully she loked up-on Troye, Biheld the toures heighe and eek the halles; ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘the plesaunce and the Ioye The whiche that now al torned in-to galle is, Have I had ofte with-inne yonder walles! O Troilus, what dostow now,’ she seyde; ‘Lord! whether yet thou thenke up-on Criseyde? 106 Allas! I ne hadde trowed on your lore, And went with yow, as ye me radde er this! Thanne hadde I now not syked half so sore. Who mighte have seyd, that I had doon a-mis To stele awey with swich on as he is? But al to late cometh the letuarie, Whan men the cors un-to the grave carie. 107 To late is now to speke of this matere; Prudence, allas! oon of thyn eyen three Me lakked alwey, er that I cam here; On tyme y-passed, wel remembred me; And present tyme eek coude I wel y-see. But futur tyme, er I was in the snare, Coude I not seen; that causeth now my care. 108 But natheles, bityde what bityde, I shal to-morwe at night, by est or weste, Out of this ost stele on som maner syde, And go with Troilus wher-as him leste. This purpos wol I holde, and this is beste. No fors of wikked tonges Ianglerye, For ever on love han wrecches had envye. 109 For who-so wole of every word take hede, Or rewlen him by every wightes wit, Ne shal he never thryven, out of drede. For that that som men blamen ever yit, Lo, other maner folk commenden it. And as for me, for al swich variaunce, Felicitee clepe I my suffisaunce. 110 For which, with-outen any wordes mo, To Troye I wol, as for conclusioun.’ But god it wot, er fully monthes two, She was ful fer fro that entencioun. For bothe Troilus and Troye toun Shal knotteles through-out hir herte slyde; For she wol take a purpos for tabyde. 111 This Diomede, of whom yow telle I gan, Goth now, with-inne him-self ay arguinge With al the sleighte and al that ever he can, How he may best, with shortest taryinge, In-to his net Criseydes herte bringe. To this entente he coude never fyne; To fisshen hir, he leyde out hook and lyne. 112 But natheles, wel in his herte he thoughte, That she nas nat with-oute a love in Troye. For never, sithen he hir thennes broughte, Ne coude he seen her laughe or make Ioye. He niste how best hir herte for tacoye. ‘But for to assaye,’ he seyde, ‘it nought ne greveth; For he that nought nassayeth, nought nacheveth.’ 113 Yet seide he to him-self upon a night, ‘Now am I not a fool, that woot wel how Hir wo for love is of another wight, And here-up-on to goon assaye hir now? I may wel wite, it nil not been my prow. For wyse folk in bokes it expresse, “Men shal not wowe a wight in hevinesse.” 114 But who-so mighte winnen swich a flour From him, for whom she morneth night and day, He mighte seyn, he were a conquerour.’ And right anoon, as he that bold was ay, Thoughte in his herte, ‘happe, how happe may, Al sholde I deye, I wole hir herte seche; I shal no more lesen but my speche.’ 115 This Diomede, as bokes us declare, Was in his nedes prest and corageous; With sterne voys and mighty limes square, Hardy, testif, strong, and chevalrous Of dedes, lyk his fader Tideus. And som men seyn, he was of tunge large; And heir he was of Calidoine and Arge. 116 Criseyde mene was of hir stature, Ther-to of shap, of face, and eek of chere, Ther mighte been no fairer creature. And ofte tyme this was hir manere, To gon y-tressed with hir heres clere Doun by hir coler at hir bak bihinde, Which with a threde of gold she wolde binde. 117 And, save hir browes ioyneden y-fere, Ther nas no lak, in ought I can espyen; But for to speken of hir eyen clere, Lo, trewely, they writen that hir syen, That Paradys stood formed in hir yën. And with hir riche beautee ever-more Strof love in hir, ay which of hem was more. 118 She sobre was, eek simple, and wys with-al, The beste y-norisshed eek that mighte be, And goodly of hir speche in general, Charitable, estatliche, lusty, and free; Ne never-mo ne lakkede hir pitee; Tendre-herted, slydinge of corage; But trewely, I can not telle hir age. 119 And Troilus wel waxen was in highte, And complet formed by proporcioun So wel, that kinde it not amenden mighte; Yong, fresshe, strong, and hardy as lyoun; Trewe as steel in ech condicioun; On of the beste enteched creature, That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure. 120 And certainly in storie it is y-founde, That Troilus was never un-to no wight, As in his tyme, in no degree secounde In durring don that longeth to a knight. Al mighte a geaunt passen him of might, His herte ay with the firste and with the beste Stod paregal, to durre don that him leste. 121 But for to tellen forth of Diomede:— It fil that after, on the tenthe day, Sin that Criseyde out of the citee yede, This Diomede, as fresshe as braunche in May, Com to the tente ther-as Calkas lay, And feyned him with Calkas han to done; But what he mente, I shal yow telle sone. 122 Criseyde, at shorte wordes for to telle, Welcomed him, and doun by hir him sette; And he was ethe y-nough to maken dwelle. And after this, with-outen longe lette, The spyces and the wyn men forth hem fette; And forth they speke of this and that y-fere, As freendes doon, of which som shal ye here. 123 He gan first fallen of the werre in speche Bitwixe hem and the folk of Troye toun; And of thassege he gan hir eek byseche, To telle him what was hir opinioun. Fro that demaunde he so descendeth doun To asken hir, if that hir straunge thoughte The Grekes gyse, and werkes that they wroughte? 124 And why hir fader tarieth so longe To wedden hir un-to som worthy wight? Criseyde, that was in hir peynes stronge For love of Troilus, hir owene knight, As fer-forth as she conning hadde or might, Answerde him tho; but, as of his entente, It semed not she wiste what he mente. 125 But natheles, this ilke Diomede Gan in him-self assure, and thus he seyde, ‘If ich aright have taken of yow hede, Me thinketh thus, O lady myn, Criseyde, That sin I first hond on your brydel leyde, Whan ye out come of Troye by the morwe, Ne coude I never seen yow but in sorwe. 126 Can I not seyn what may the cause be But-if for love of som Troyan it were, The which right sore wolde athinken me That ye, for any wight that dwelleth there, Sholden spille a quarter of a tere, Or pitously your-selven so bigyle; For dredelees, it is nought worth the whyle. 127 The folk of Troye, as who seyth, alle and some In preson been, as ye your-selven see; For thennes shal not oon on-lyve come For al the gold bitwixen sonne and see. Trusteth wel, and understondeth me, Ther shal not oon to mercy goon on-lyve, Al were he lord of worldes twyës fyve! 128 Swich wreche on hem, for fecching of Eleyne, Ther shal be take, er that we hennes wende, That Manes, which that goddes ben of peyne, Shal been agast that Grekes wol hem shende. And men shul drede, un-to the worldes ende, From hennes-forth to ravisshe any quene, So cruel shal our wreche on hem be sene. 129 And but-if Calkas lede us with ambages, That is to seyn, with double wordes slye, Swich as men clepe a “word with two visages,” Ye shul wel knowen that I nought ne lye, And al this thing right seen it with your yë, And that anoon; ye nil not trowe how sone; Now taketh heed, for it is for to done. 130 What wene ye your wyse fader wolde Han yeven Antenor for yow anoon, If he ne wiste that the citee sholde Destroyed been? Why, nay, so mote I goon! He knew ful wel ther shal not scapen oon That Troyan is; and for the grete fere, He dorste not, ye dwelte lenger there. 131 What wole ye more, lufsom lady dere? Lat Troye and Troyan fro your herte pace! Dryf out that bittre hope, and make good chere, And clepe ayein the beautee of your face, That ye with salte teres so deface. For Troye is brought in swich a Iupartye, That, it to save, is now no remedye. 132 And thenketh wel, ye shal in Grekes finde A more parfit love, er it be night, Than any Troyan is, and more kinde, And bet to serven yow wol doon his might. And if ye vouche sauf, my lady bright, I wol ben he to serven yow my-selve, Ye, lever than be lord of Greces twelve!’ 133 And with that word he gan to waxen reed, And in his speche a litel wight he quook, And caste a-syde a litel wight his heed, And stinte a whyle; and afterward awook, And sobreliche on hir he threw his look, And seyde, ‘I am, al be it yow no Ioye, As gentil man as any wight in Troye. 134 For if my fader Tydeus,’ he seyde, ‘Y-lived hadde, I hadde been, er this, Of Calidoine and Arge a king, Criseyde! And so hope I that I shal yet, y-wis. But he was slayn, allas! the more harm is, Unhappily at Thebes al to rathe, Polymites and many a man to scathe. 135 But herte myn, sin that I am your man, And been the ferste of whom I seche grace, To serven you as hertely as I can, And ever shal, whyl I to live have space, So, er that I departe out of this place, Ye wol me graunte, that I may to-morwe, At bettre leyser, telle yow my sorwe.’ 136 What shold I telle his wordes that he seyde? He spak y-now, for o day at the meste; It preveth wel, he spak so that Criseyde Graunted, on the morwe, at his requeste, For to speken with him at the leste, So that he nolde speke of swich matere; And thus to him she seyde, as ye may here: 137 As she that hadde hir herte on Troilus So faste, that ther may it noon arace; And straungely she spak, and seyde thus: ‘O Diomede, I love that ilke place Ther I was born; and Ioves, for his grace, Delivere it sone of al that doth it care! God, for thy might, so leve it wel to fare! 138 That Grekes wolde hir wraththe on Troye wreke, If that they mighte, I knowe it wel, y-wis. But it shal not bifallen as ye speke; And god to-forn, and ferther over this, I wot my fader wys and redy is; And that he me hath bought, as ye me tolde, So dere, I am the more un-to him holde. 139 That Grekes been of heigh condicioun, I woot eek wel; but certein, men shal finde As worthy folk with-inne Troye toun, As conning, and as parfit and as kinde, As been bitwixen Orcades and Inde. And that ye coude wel your lady serve, I trowe eek wel, hir thank for to deserve. 140 But as to speke of love, y-wis,’ she seyde, ‘I hadde a lord, to whom I wedded was, The whos myn herte al was, til that he deyde; And other love, as helpe me now Pallas, Ther in myn herte nis, ne never was. And that ye been of noble and heigh kinrede, I have wel herd it tellen, out of drede. 141 And that doth me to han so gret a wonder, That ye wol scornen any womman so. Eek, god wot, love and I be fer a-sonder; I am disposed bet, so mote I go, Un-to my deeth, to pleyne and maken wo. What I shal after doon, I can not seye; But trewely, as yet me list not pleye. 142 Myn herte is now in tribulacioun, And ye in armes bisy, day by day. Here-after, whan ye wonnen han the toun, Paraunter, thanne so it happen may, That whan I see that I never er say, Than wole I werke that I never wroughte! This word to yow y-nough suffysen oughte. 143 To-morwe eek wol I speke with yow fayn, So that ye touchen nought of this matere. And whan yow list, ye may come here ayeyn; And, er ye gon, thus muche I seye yow here: As helpe me Pallas with hir heres clere, If that I sholde of any Greek han routhe, It sholde be your-selven, by my trouthe! 144 I sey not therfore that I wol yow love, Ne I sey not nay, but in conclusioun, I mene wel, by god that sit above:’— And ther-with-al she caste hir eyen doun, And gan to syke, and seyde, ‘O Troye toun, Yet bidde I god, in quiete and in reste I may yow seen, or do myn herte breste.’ 145 But in effect, and shortly for to seye, This Diomede al freshly newe ayeyn Gan pressen on, and faste hir mercy preye; And after this, the sothe for to seyn, Hir glove he took, of which he was ful fayn. And fynally, whan it was waxen eve, And al was wel, he roos and took his leve. 146 The brighte Venus folwede and ay taughte The wey, ther brode Phebus doun alighte; And Cynthea hir char-hors over-raughte To whirle out of the Lyon, if she mighte; And Signifer his candeles shewed brighte, Whan that Criseyde un-to hir bedde wente In-with hir fadres faire brighte tente. 147 Retorning in hir soule ay up and doun The wordes of this sodein Diomede, His greet estat, and peril of the toun, And that she was allone and hadde nede Of freendes help; and thus bigan to brede The cause why, the sothe for to telle, That she tok fully purpos for to dwelle. 148 The morwe com, and goostly for to speke, This Diomede is come un-to Criseyde, And shortly, lest that ye my tale breke, So wel he for him-selve spak and seyde, That alle hir sykes sore adoun he leyde. And fynally, the sothe for to seyne, He refte hir of the grete of al hir peyne. 149 And after this the story telleth us, That she him yaf the faire baye stede, The which she ones wan of Troilus; And eek a broche (and that was litel nede) That Troilus was, she yaf this Diomede. And eek, the bet from sorwe him to releve, She made him were a pencel of hir sleve. 150 I finde eek in the stories elles-where, Whan through the body hurt was Diomede Of Troilus, tho weep she many a tere, Whan that she saugh his wyde woundes blede; And that she took to kepen him good hede, And for to hele him of his sorwes smerte. Men seyn, I not, that she yaf him hir herte. 151 But trewely, the story telleth us, Ther made never womman more wo Than she, whan that she falsed Troilus. She seyde, ‘allas! for now is clene a-go My name of trouthe in love, for ever-mo! For I have falsed oon, the gentileste That ever was, and oon the worthieste! 152 Allas, of me, un-to the worldes ende, Shal neither been y-writen nor y-songe No good word, for thise bokes wol me shende. O, rolled shal I been on many a tonge; Through-out the world my belle shal be ronge; And wommen most wol hate me of alle. Allas, that swich a cas me sholde falle! 153 They wol seyn, in as muche as in me is, I have hem don dishonour, weylawey! Al be I not the firste that dide amis, What helpeth that to do my blame awey? But sin I see there is no bettre way, And that to late is now for me to rewe, To Diomede algate I wol be trewe. 154 But Troilus, sin I no better may, And sin that thus departen ye and I, Yet preye I god, so yeve yow right good day As for the gentileste, trewely, That ever I say, to serven feithfully, And best can ay his lady honour kepe:’— And with that word she brast anon to wepe. 155 ‘And certes, yow ne haten shal I never, And freendes love, that shal ye han of me, And my good word, al mighte I liven ever. And, trewely, I wolde sory be For to seen yow in adversitee. And giltelees, I woot wel, I yow leve; But al shal passe; and thus take I my leve.’ 156 But trewely, how longe it was bitwene, That she for-sook him for this Diomede, Ther is non auctor telleth it, I wene. Take every man now to his bokes hede; He shal no terme finden, out of drede. For though that he bigan to wowe hir sone, Er he hir wan, yet was ther more to done. 157 Ne me ne list this sely womman chyde Ferther than the story wol devyse. Hir name, allas! is publisshed so wyde, That for hir gilt it oughte y-now suffyse. And if I mighte excuse hir any wyse, For she so sory was for hir untrouthe, Y-wis, I wolde excuse hir yet for routhe. 158 This Troilus, as I biforn have told, Thus dryveth forth, as wel as he hath might. But often was his herte hoot and cold, And namely, that ilke nynthe night, Which on the morwe she hadde him byhight To come ayein: god wot, ful litel reste Hadde he that night; no-thing to slepe him leste. 159 The laurer-crouned Phebus, with his hete, Gan, in his course ay upward as he wente, To warmen of the est see the wawes wete; And Nisus doughter song with fresh entente, Whan Troilus his Pandare after sente; And on the walles of the toun they pleyde, To loke if they can seen ought of Criseyde. 160 Til it was noon, they stoden for to see Who that ther come; and every maner wight, That cam fro fer, they seyden it was she, Til that they coude knowen him a-right. Now was his herte dul, now was it light; And thus by-iaped stonden for to stare Aboute nought, this Troilus and Pandare. 161 To Pandarus this Troilus tho seyde, ‘For ought I wot, bi-for noon, sikerly, In-to this toun ne comth nought here Criseyde. She hath y-now to done, hardily, To winnen from hir fader, so trowe I; Hir olde fader wol yet make hir dyne Er that she go; god yeve his herte pyne!’ 162 Pandare answerde, ‘it may wel be, certeyn; And for-thy lat us dyne, I thee biseche; And after noon than mayst thou come ayeyn.’ And hoom they go, with-oute more speche; And comen ayein, but longe may they seche Er that they finde that they after cape; Fortune hem bothe thenketh for to Iape. 163 Quod Troilus, ‘I see wel now, that she Is taried with hir olde fader so, That er she come, it wol neigh even be. Com forth, I wol un-to the yate go. Thise portours been unkonninge ever-mo; And I wol doon hem holden up the yate As nought ne were, al-though she come late.’ 164 The day goth faste, and after that comth eve, And yet com nought to Troilus Criseyde. He loketh forth by hegge, by tree, by greve, And fer his heed over the wal he leyde. And at the laste he torned him, and seyde, ‘By god, I woot hir mening now, Pandare! Al-most, y-wis, al newe was my care. 165 Now douteles, this lady can hir good; I woot, she meneth ryden prively. I comende hir wysdom, by myn hood! She wol not maken peple nycely Gaure on hir, whan she comth; but softely By nighte in-to the toun she thenketh ryde. And, dere brother, thenk not longe to abyde. 166 We han nought elles for to don, y-wis. And Pandarus, now woltow trowen me? Have here my trouthe, I see hir! yond she is. Heve up thyn eyen, man! maystow not see?’ Pandare answerde, ‘nay, so mote I thee! Al wrong, by god; what seystow, man, wher art? That I see yond nis but a fare-cart.’ 167 ‘Allas, thou seist right sooth,’ quod Troilus; ‘But hardely, it is not al for nought That in myn herte I now reioyse thus. It is ayein som good I have a thought. Noot I not how, but sin that I was wrought, Ne felte I swich a confort, dar I seye; She comth to-night, my lyf, that dorste I leye!’ 168 Pandare answerde, ‘it may be wel, y-nough’; And held with him of al that ever he seyde; But in his herte he thoughte, and softe lough, And to him-self ful sobrely he seyde: ‘From hasel-wode, ther Ioly Robin pleyde, Shal come al that that thou abydest here; Ye, fare-wel al the snow of ferne yere!’ 169 The wardein of the yates gan to calle The folk which that with-oute the yates were, And bad hem dryven in hir bestes alle, Or al the night they moste bleven there. And fer with-in the night, with many a tere, This Troilus gan hoomward for to ryde; For wel he seeth it helpeth nought tabyde. 170 But natheles, he gladded him in this; He thoughte he misacounted hadde his day, And seyde, ‘I understonde have al a-mis. For thilke night I last Criseyde say, She seyde, “I shal ben here, if that I may, Er that the mone, O dere herte swete! The Lyon passe, out of this Ariete.” 171 For which she may yet holde al hir biheste.’ And on the morwe un-to the yate he wente, And up and down, by west and eek by este, Up-on the walles made he many a wente. But al for nought; his hope alwey him blente; For which at night, in sorwe and sykes sore He wente him hoom, with-outen any more. 172 This hope al clene out of his herte fledde, He nath wher-on now lenger for to honge; But for the peyne him thoughte his herte bledde, So were his throwes sharpe and wonder stronge. For when he saugh that she abood so longe, He niste what he iuggen of it mighte, Sin she hath broken that she him bihighte. 173 The thridde, ferthe, fifte, sixte day After tho dayes ten, of which I tolde, Bitwixen hope and drede his herte lay, Yet som-what trustinge on hir hestes olde. But whan he saugh she nolde hir terme holde, He can now seen non other remedye, But for to shape him sone for to dye. 174 Ther-with the wikked spirit, god us blesse, Which that men clepeth wode Ialousye, Gan in him crepe, in al this hevinesse; For which, by-cause he wolde sone dye, He ne eet ne dronk, for his malencolye, And eek from every companye he fledde; This was the lyf that al the tyme he ledde. 175 He so defet was, that no maner man Unnethe mighte him knowe ther he wente; So was he lene, and ther-to pale and wan, And feble, that he walketh by potente; And with his ire he thus him-selven shente. And who-so axed him wher-of him smerte, He seyde, his harm was al aboute his herte. 176 Pryam ful ofte, and eek his moder dere, His bretheren and his sustren gonne him freyne Why he so sorwful was in al his chere, And what thing was the cause of al his peyne? But al for nought; he nolde his cause pleyne, But seyde, he felte a grevous maladye A-boute his herte, and fayn he wolde dye. 177 So on a day he leyde him doun to slepe, And so bifel that in his sleep him thoughte, That in a forest faste he welk to wepe For love of hir that him these peynes wroughte; And up and doun as he the forest soughte, He mette he saugh a boor with tuskes grete, That sleep ayein the brighte sonnes hete. 178 And by this boor, faste in his armes folde, Lay kissing ay his lady bright Criseyde: For sorwe of which, whan he it gan biholde, And for despyt, out of his slepe he breyde, And loude he cryde on Pandarus, and seyde, ‘O Pandarus, now knowe I crop and rote! I nam but deed, ther nis non other bote! 179 My lady bright Criseyde hath me bitrayed, In whom I trusted most of any wight, She elles-where hath now hir herte apayed; The blisful goddes, through hir grete might, Han in my dreem y-shewed it ful right. Thus in my dreem Criseyde I have biholde’— And al this thing to Pandarus he tolde. 180 ‘O my Criseyde, allas! what subtiltee, What newe lust, what beautee, what science, What wratthe of iuste cause have ye to me? What gilt of me, whal fel experience Hath fro me raft, allas! thyn advertence? O trust, O feyth, O depe asëuraunce, Who hath me reft Criseyde, al my plesaunce? 181 Allas! why leet I you from hennes go, For which wel neigh out of my wit I breyde? Who shal now trowe on any othes mo? God wot I wende, O lady bright, Criseyde, That every word was gospel that ye seyde! But who may bet bigylen, if him liste, Than he on whom men weneth best to triste? 182 What shal I doon, my Pandarus, allas! I fele now so sharpe a newe peyne, Sin that ther is no remedie in this cas, That bet were it I with myn hondes tweyne My-selven slow, than alwey thus to pleyne. For through my deeth my wo sholde han an ende, Ther every day with lyf my-self I shende.’ 183 Pandare answerde and seyde, ‘allas the whyle That I was born; have I not seyd er this, That dremes many a maner man bigyle? And why? for folk expounden hem a-mis. How darstow seyn that fals thy lady is, For any dreem, right for thyn owene drede? Lat be this thought, thou canst no dremes rede. 184 Paraunter, ther thou dremest of this boor, It may so be that it may signifye Hir fader, which that old is and eek hoor, Ayein the sonne lyth, on poynt to dye, And she for sorwe ginneth wepe and crye, And kisseth him, ther he lyth on the grounde; Thus shuldestow thy dreem a-right expounde.’ 185 ‘How mighte I thanne do?’ quod Troilus, ‘To knowe of this, ye, were it never so lyte?’ ‘Now seystow wysly,’ quod this Pandarus, ‘My reed is this, sin thou canst wel endyte, That hastely a lettre thou hir wryte, Thorugh which thou shalt wel bringen it aboute, To knowe a sooth of that thou art in doute. 186 And see now why; for this I dar wel seyn, That if so is that she untrewe be, I can not trowe that she wol wryte ayeyn. And if she wryte, thou shalt ful sone see, As whether she hath any libertee To come ayein, or elles in som clause, If she be let, she wol assigne a cause. 187 Thou hast not writen hir sin that she wente, Nor she to thee, and this I dorste leye, Ther may swich cause been in hir entente, That hardely thou wolt thy-selven seye, That hir a-bood the beste is for yow tweye. Now wryte hir thanne, and thou shalt fele sone A sothe of al; ther is no more to done.’ 188 Acorded been to this conclusioun, And that anoon, these ilke lordes two; And hastely sit Troilus adoun, And rolleth in his herte to and fro, How he may best discryven hir his wo. And to Criseyde, his owene lady dere, He wroot right thus, and seyde as ye may here. 189 ‘Right fresshe flour, whos I have been and shal, With-outen part of elles-where servyse, With herte, body, lyf, lust, thought, and al; I, woful wight, in every humble wyse That tonge telle or herte may devyse, As ofte as matere occupyeth place, Me recomaunde un-to your noble grace. 190 Lyketh it yow to witen, swete herte, As ye wel knowe how longe tyme agoon That ye me lafte in aspre peynes smerte, Whan that ye wente, of which yet bote noon Have I non had, but ever wers bigoon Fro day to day am I, and so mot dwelle, While it yow list, of wele and wo my welle! 191 For which to yow, with dredful herte trewe, I wryte, as he that sorwe dryfth to wryte, My wo, that every houre encreseth newe, Compleyninge as I dar or can endyte. And that defaced is, that may ye wyte The teres, which that fro myn eyen reyne, That wolde speke, if that they coude, and pleyne. 192 Yow first biseche I, that your eyen clere To look on this defouled ye not holde; And over al this, that ye, my lady dere, Wol vouche-sauf this lettre to biholde. And by the cause eek of my cares colde, That sleeth my wit, if ought amis me asterte, For-yeve it me, myn owene swete herte. 193 If any servant dorste or oughte of right Up-on his lady pitously compleyne, Than wene I, that ich oughte be that wight, Considered this, that ye these monthes tweyne Han taried, ther ye seyden, sooth to seyne, But dayes ten ye nolde in ost soiourne, But in two monthes yet ye not retourne. 194 But for-as-muche as me mot nedes lyke Al that yow list, I dar not pleyne more, But humbely with sorwful sykes syke; Yow wryte ich myn unresty sorwes sore, Fro day to day desyring ever-more To knowen fully, if your wil it were, How ye han ferd and doon, whyl ye be there. 195 The whos wel-fare and hele eek god encresse In honour swich, that upward in degree It growe alwey, so that it never cesse; Right as your herte ay can, my lady free, Devyse, I prey to god so mote it be. And graunte it that ye sone up-on me rewe As wisly as in al I am yow trewe. 196 And if yow lyketh knowen of the fare Of me, whos wo ther may no wight discryve, I can no more but, cheste of every care, At wrytinge of this lettre I was on-lyve, Al redy out my woful gost to dryve; Which I delaye, and holde him yet in honde, Upon the sight of matere of your sonde. 197 Myn eyen two, in veyn with which I see, Of sorweful teres salte arn waxen welles; My song, in pleynte of myn adversitee; My good, in harm; myn ese eek waxen helle is. My Ioye, in wo; I can sey yow nought elles, But turned is, for which my lyf I warie, Everich Ioye or ese in his contrarie. 198 Which with your cominge hoom ayein to Troye Ye may redresse, and, more a thousand sythe Than ever ich hadde, encressen in me Ioye. For was ther never herte yet so blythe To han his lyf, as I shal been as swythe As I yow see; and, though no maner routhe Commeve yow, yet thinketh on your trouthe. 199 And if so be my gilt hath deeth deserved, Or if you list no more up-on me see, In guerdon yet of that I have you served, Biseche I yow, myn hertes lady free, That here-upon ye wolden wryte me, For love of god, my righte lode-sterre, Ther deeth may make an ende of al my werre. 200 If other cause aught doth yow for to dwelle, That with your lettre ye me recomforte; For though to me your absence is an helle, With pacience I wol my wo comporte. And with your lettre of hope I wol desporte. Now wryteth, swete, and lat me thus not pleyne; With hope, or deeth, delivereth me fro peyne. 201 Y-wis, myn owene dere herte trewe, I woot that, whan ye next up-on me see, So lost have I myn hele and eek myn hewe, Criseyde shal nought conne knowe me! Y-wis, myn hertes day, my lady free, So thursteth ay myn herte to biholde Your beautee, that my lyf unnethe I holde. 202 I sey no more, al have I for to seye To you wel more than I telle may; But whether that ye do me live or deye, Yet pray I god, so yeve yow right good day. And fareth wel, goodly fayre fresshe may, As ye that lyf or deeth me may comaunde; And to your trouthe ay I me recomaunde 203 With hele swich that, but ye yeven me The same hele, I shal noon hele have. In you lyth, whan yow list that it so be, The day in which me clothen shal my grave. In yow my lyf, in yow might for to save Me from disese of alle peynes smerte; And fare now wel, myn owene swete herte! Le vostre T.’ 204 This lettre forth was sent un-to Criseyde, Of which hir answere in effect was this; Ful pitously she wroot ayein, and seyde, That al-so sone as that she might, y-wis, She wolde come, and mende al that was mis. And fynally she wroot and seyde him thanne, She wolde come, ye, but she niste whanne. 205 But in hir lettre made she swich festes, That wonder was, and swereth she loveth him best, Of which he fond but botmelees bihestes. But Troilus, thou mayst now, est or west, Pype in an ivy leef, if that thee lest; Thus gooth the world; god shilde us fro mischaunce, And every wight that meneth trouthe avaunce! 206 Encresen gan the wo fro day to night Of Troilus, for taryinge of Criseyde; And lessen gan his hope and eek his might, For which al doun he in his bed him leyde; He ne eet, ne dronk, ne sleep, ne word he seyde, Imagininge ay that she was unkinde; For which wel neigh he wex out of his minde. 207 This dreem, of which I told have eek biforn, May never come out of his remembraunce; He thoughte ay wel he hadde his lady lorn, And that Ioves, of his purveyaunce, Him shewed hadde in sleep the signifiaunce Of hir untrouthe and his disaventure, And that the boor was shewed him in figure. 208 For which he for Sibille his suster sente, That called was Cassandre eek al aboute; And al his dreem he tolde hir er he stente, And hir bisoughte assoilen him the doute Of the stronge boor, with tuskes stoute; And fynally, with-inne a litel stounde, Cassandre him gan right thus his dreem expounde. 209 She gan first smyle, and seyde, ‘O brother dere, If thou a sooth of this desyrest knowe, Thou most a fewe of olde stories here, To purpos, how that fortune over-throwe Hath lordes olde; through which, with-inne a throwe, Thou wel this boor shalt knowe, and of what kinde He comen is, as men in bokes finde. 210 Diane, which that wrooth was and in ire For Grekes nolde doon hir sacrifyse, Ne encens up-on hir auter sette a-fyre, She, for that Grekes gonne hir so dispyse, Wrak hir in a wonder cruel wyse. For with a boor as greet as oxe in stalle She made up frete hir corn and vynes alle. 211 To slee this boor was al the contree reysed, A-monges which ther com, this boor to see, A mayde, oon of this world the best y-preysed; And Meleagre, lord of that contree, He lovede so this fresshe mayden free That with his manhod, er he wolde stente, This boor he slow, and hir the heed he sente; 212 Of which, as olde bokes tellen us, Ther roos a contek and a greet envye; And of this lord descended Tydeus By ligne, or elles olde bokes lye; But how this Meleagre gan to dye Thorugh his moder, wol I yow not telle, For al to long it were for to dwelle.’ [Argument of the 12 Books of Statius' Thebais.] Associat profugum Tideo primus Polimitem; Tidea legatum docet insidiasque secundus; Tercius Hemoniden canit et vates latitantes; Quartus habet reges ineuntes prelia septem; Mox furie Lenne quinto narratur et anguis; Archimori bustum sexto ludique leguntur; Dat Graios Thebes et vatem septimus vmbris; Octauo cecidit Tideus, spes, vita Pelasgis; Ypomedon nono moritur cum Parthonopeo; Fulmine percussus, decimo Capaneus superatur; Vndecimo sese perimunt per vulnera fratres; Argiuam flentem narrat duodenus et ignem. 213 She toldë eek how Tydeus, er she stente, Un-to the stronge citee of Thebes, To cleyme kingdom of the citee, wente, For his felawe, daun Polymites, Of which the brother, daun Ethyocles, Ful wrongfully of Thebes held the strengthe; This tolde she by proces, al by lengthe. 214 She tolde eek how Hemonides asterte, Whan Tydeus slough fifty knightes stoute. She told eek al the prophesyes by herte, And how that sevene kinges, with hir route, Bisegeden the citee al aboute; And of the holy serpent, and the welle, And of the furies, al she gan him telle. 215 Of Archimoris buryinge and the pleyes, And how Amphiorax fil through the grounde, How Tydeus was slayn, lord of Argeyes, And how Ypomedoun in litel stounde Was dreynt, and deed Parthonope of wounde; And also how Cappanëus the proude With thonder-dint was slayn, that cryde loude. 216 She gan eek telle him how that either brother, Ethyocles and Polimyte also, At a scarmyche, eche of hem slough other, And of Argyves wepinge and hir wo; And how the town was brent she tolde eek tho. And so descendeth doun from gestes olde To Diomede, and thus she spak and tolde. 217 ‘This ilke boor bitokneth Diomede, Tydeus sone, that doun descended is Fro Meleagre, that made the boor to blede. And thy lady, wher-so she be, y-wis, This Diomede hir herte hath, and she his. Weep if thou wolt, or leef; for, out of doute, This Diomede is inne, and thou art oute.’ 218 ‘Thou seyst nat sooth,’ quod he, ‘thou sorceresse, With al thy false goost of prophesye! Thou wenest been a greet devyneresse; Now seestow not this fool of fantasye Peyneth hir on ladyes for to lye? Awey,’ quod he, ‘ther Ioves yeve thee sorwe! Thou shalt be fals, paraunter, yet to-morwe! 219 As wel thou mightest lyen on Alceste, That was of creatures, but men lye, That ever weren, kindest and the beste. For whanne hir housbonde was in Iupartye To dye him-self, but-if she wolde dye, She chees for him to dye and go to helle, And starf anoon, as us the bokes telle.’ 220 Cassandre goth, and he with cruel herte For-yat his wo, for angre of hir speche; And from his bed al sodeinly he sterte, As though al hool him hadde y-mad a leche. And day by day he gan enquere and seche A sooth of this, with al his fulle cure; And thus he dryeth forth his aventure. 221 Fortune, whiche that permutacioun Of thinges hath, as it is hir committed Through purveyaunce and disposicioun Of heighe Iove, as regnes shal ben flitted Fro folk in folk, or whan they shal ben smitted, Gan pulle awey the fetheres brighte of Troye Fro day to day, til they ben bare of Ioye. 222 Among al this, the fyn of the parodie Of Ector gan approchen wonder blyve; The fate wolde his soule sholde unbodie, And shapen hadde a mene it out to dryve; Ayeins which fate him helpeth not to stryve; But on a day to fighten gan he wende, At which, allas! he caughte his lyves ende. 223 For which me thinketh every maner wight That haunteth armes oughte to biwayle The deeth of him that was so noble a knight; For as he drough a king by thaventayle, Unwar of this, Achilles through the mayle And through the body gan him for to ryve; And thus this worthy knight was brought of lyve. 224 For whom, as olde bokes tellen us, Was mad swich wo, that tonge it may not telle; And namely, the sorwe of Troilus, That next him was of worthinesse welle. And in this wo gan Troilus to dwelle, That, what for sorwe, and love, and for unreste, Ful ofte a day he bad his herte breste. 225 But natheles, though he gan him dispeyre, And dradde ay that his lady was untrewe, Yet ay on hir his herte gan repeyre. And as these loveres doon, he soughte ay newe To gete ayein Criseyde, bright of hewe. And in his herte he wente hir excusinge, That Calkas causede al hir taryinge. 226 And ofte tyme he was in purpos grete Him-selven lyk a pilgrim to disgyse, To seen hir; but he may not contrefete To been unknowen of folk that weren wyse, Ne finde excuse aright that may suffyse, If he among the Grekes knowen were; For which he weep ful ofte many a tere. 227 To hir he wroot yet ofte tyme al newe Ful pitously, he lefte it nought for slouthe, Biseching hir that, sin that he was trewe, She wolde come ayein and holde hir trouthe. For which Criseyde up-on a day, for routhe, I take it so, touchinge al this matere, Wrot him ayein, and seyde as ye may here. 228 ‘Cupydes sone, ensample of goodlihede, O swerd of knighthod, sours of gentilesse! How mighte a wight in torment and in drede And helelees, yow sende as yet gladnesse? I hertelees, I syke, I in distresse; Sin ye with me, nor I with yow may dele, Yow neither sende ich herte may nor hele. 229 Your lettres ful, the papir al y-pleynted, Conseyved hath myn hertes piëtee; I have eek seyn with teres al depeynted Your lettre, and how that ye requeren me To come ayein, which yet ne may not be. But why, lest that this lettre founden were, No mencioun ne make I now, for fere. 230 Grevous to me, god woot, is your unreste, Your haste, and that, the goddes ordenaunce, It semeth not ye take it for the beste. Nor other thing nis in your remembraunce, As thinketh me, but only your plesaunce. But beth not wrooth, and that I yow biseche; For that I tarie, is al for wikked speche. 231 For I have herd wel more than I wende, Touchinge us two, how thinges han y-stonde; Which I shal with dissimulinge amende. And beth nought wrooth, I have eek understonde, How ye ne doon but holden me in honde. But now no fors, I can not in yow gesse But alle trouthe and alle gentilesse. 232 Comen I wol, but yet in swich disioynte I stonde as now, that what yeer or what day That this shal be, that can I not apoynte. But in effect, I prey yow, as I may, Of your good word and of your frendship ay. For trewely, whyl that my lyf may dure, As for a freend, ye may in me assure. 233 Yet preye I yow on yvel ye ne take, That it is short which that I to yow wryte; I dar not, ther I am, wel lettres make, Ne never yet ne coude I wel endyte. Eek greet effect men wryte in place lyte. Thentente is al, and nought the lettres space; And fareth now wel, god have you in his grace! La vostre C.’ 234 This Troilus this lettre thoughte al straunge, Whan he it saugh, and sorwefully he sighte; Him thoughte it lyk a kalendes of chaunge; But fynally, he ful ne trowen mighte That she ne wolde him holden that she highte; For with ful yvel wil list him to leve That loveth wel, in swich cas, though him greve. 235 But natheles, men seyn that, at the laste, For any thing, men shal the sothe see; And swich a cas bitidde, and that as faste, That Troilus wel understood that she Nas not so kinde as that hir oughte be. And fynally, he woot now, out of doute, That al is lost that he hath been aboute. 236 Stood on a day in his malencolye This Troilus, and in suspecioun Of hir for whom he wende for to dye. And so bifel, that through-out Troye toun, As was the gyse, y-bore was up and doun A maner cote-armure, as seyth the storie, Biforn Deiphebe, in signe of his victorie, 237 The whiche cote, as telleth Lollius, Deiphebe it hadde y-rent from Diomede The same day; and whan this Troilus It saugh, he gan to taken of it hede, Avysing of the lengthe and of the brede, And al the werk; but as he gan biholde, Ful sodeinly his herte gan to colde, 238 As he that on the coler fond with-inne A broche, that he Criseyde yaf that morwe That she from Troye moste nedes twinne, In remembraunce of him and of his sorwe; And she him leyde ayein hir feyth to borwe To kepe it ay; but now, ful wel he wiste, His lady nas no lenger on to triste. 239 He gooth him hoom, and gan ful sone sende For Pandarus; and al this newe chaunce, And of this broche, he tolde him word and ende, Compleyninge of hir hertes variaunce, His longe love, his trouthe, and his penaunce; And after deeth, with-outen wordes more, Ful faste he cryde, his reste him to restore. 240 Than spak he thus, ‘O lady myn Criseyde, Wher is your feyth, and wher is your biheste? Wher is your love, wher is your trouthe,’ he seyde; ‘Of Diomede have ye now al this feste! Allas, I wolde have trowed at the leste, That, sin ye nolde in trouthe to me stonde, That ye thus nolde han holden me in honde! 241 Who shal now trowe on any othes mo? Allas, I never wolde han wend, er this, That ye, Criseyde, coude han chaunged so; Ne, but I hadde a-gilt and doon amis, So cruel wende I not your herte, y-wis, To slee me thus; allas, your name of trouthe Is now for-doon, and that is al my routhe. 242 Was ther non other broche yow liste lete To feffe with your newe love,” quod he, ‘But thilke broche that I, with teres wete, Yow yaf, as for a remembraunce of me? Non other cause, allas, ne hadde ye But for despyt, and eek for that ye mente Al-outrely to shewen your entente! 243 Through which I see that clene out of your minde Ye han me cast, and I ne can nor may, For al this world, with-in myn herte finde To unloven yow a quarter of a day! In cursed tyme I born was, weylaway! That ye, that doon me al this wo endure, Yet love I best of any creature. 244 Now god,’ quod he, ‘me sende yet the grace That I may meten with this Diomede! And trewely, if I have might and space, Yet shal I make, I hope, his sydes blede. O god,’ quod he, ‘that oughtest taken hede To fortheren trouthe, and wronges to punyce, Why niltow doon a vengeaunce on this vyce? 245 O Pandare, that in dremes for to triste Me blamed hast, and wont art ofte up-breyde, Now maystow see thy-selve, if that thee liste, How trewe is now thy nece, bright Criseyde! In sondry formes, god it woot,’ he seyde, ‘The goddes shewen bothe Ioye and tene In slepe, and by my dreme it is now sene. 246 And certaynly, with-oute more speche, From hennes-forth, as ferforth as I may, Myn owene deeth in armes wol I seche; I recche not how sone be the day! But trewely, Criseyde, swete may, Whom I have ay with al my might y-served, That ye thus doon, I have it nought deserved.’ 247 This Pandarus, that alle these thinges herde, And wiste wel he seyde a sooth of this, He nought a word ayein to him answerde; For sory of his frendes sorwe he is, And shamed, for his nece hath doon a-mis; And stant, astoned of these causes tweye, As stille as stoon; a word ne coude he seye. 248 But at the laste thus he spak, and seyde, ‘My brother dere, I may thee do no-more. What shulde I seyn? I hate, y-wis, Criseyde! And god wot, I wol hate hir evermore! And that thou me bisoughtest doon of yore, Havinge un-to myn honour ne my reste Right no reward, I dide al that thee leste. 249 If I dide ought that mighte lyken thee, It is me leef; and of this treson now, God woot, that it a sorwe is un-to me! And dredelees, for hertes ese of yow, Right fayn wolde I amende it, wiste I how. And fro this world, almighty god I preye, Delivere hir sone; I can no-more seye.’ 250 Gret was the sorwe and pleynt of Troilus; But forth hir cours fortune ay gan to holde. Criseyde loveth the sone of Tydeus, And Troilus mot wepe in cares colde. Swich is this world; who-so it can biholde, In eche estat is litel hertes reste; God leve us for to take it for the beste! 251 In many cruel batayle, out of drede, Of Troilus, this ilke noble knight, As men may in these olde bokes rede, Was sene his knighthod and his grete might. And dredelees, his ire, day and night, Ful cruelly the Grekes ay aboughte; And alwey most this Diomede he soughte. 252 And ofte tyme, I finde that they mette With blody strokes and with wordes grete, Assayinge how hir speres weren whette; And god it woot, with many a cruel hete Gan Troilus upon his helm to-bete. But natheles, fortune it nought ne wolde, Of otheres hond that either deyen sholde.— 253 And if I hadde y-taken for to wryte The armes of this ilke worthy man, Than wolde I of his batailles endyte. But for that I to wryte first bigan Of his love, I have seyd as that I can. His worthy dedes, who-so list hem here, Reed Dares, he can telle hem alle y-fere. 254 Bisechinge every lady bright of hewe, And every gentil womman, what she be, That al be that Criseyde was untrewe, That for that gilt she be not wrooth with me. Ye may hir gilt in othere bokes see; And gladlier I wol wryten, if yow leste, Penelopeës trouthe and good Alceste. 255 Ne I sey not this al-only for these men, But most for wommen that bitraysed be Through false folk; god yeve hem sorwe, amen! That with hir grete wit and subtiltee Bitrayse yow! and this commeveth me To speke, and in effect yow alle I preye, Beth war of men, and herkeneth what I seye!— 256 Go, litel book, go litel myn tregedie, Ther god thy maker yet, er that he dye, So sende might to make in som comedie! But litel book, no making thou nenvye, But subgit be to alle poesye; And kis the steppes, wher-as thou seest pace Virgile, Ovyde, Omer, Lucan, and Stace. 257 And for ther is so greet diversitee In English and in wryting of our tonge, So preye I god that noon miswryte thee, Ne thee mismetre for defaute of tonge. And red wher-so thou be, or elles songe, That thou be understonde I god beseche! But yet to purpos of my rather speche.— 258 The wraththe, as I began yow for to seye, Of Troilus, the Grekes boughten dere; For thousandes his hondes maden deye, As he that was with-outen any pere, Save Ector, in his tyme, as I can here. But weylaway, save only goddes wille, Dispitously him slough the fiers Achille. 259 And whan that he was slayn in this manere, His lighte goost ful blisfully is went Up to the holownesse of the seventh spere, In convers letinge every element; And ther he saugh, with ful avysement, The erratik sterres, herkeninge armonye With sownes fulle of hevenish melodye. 260 And doun from thennes faste he gan avyse This litel spot of erthe, that with the see Enbraced is, and fully gan despyse This wrecched world, and held al vanitee To respect of the pleyn felicitee That is in hevene above; and at the laste, Ther he was slayn, his loking doun he caste; 261 And in him-self he lough right at the wo Of hem that wepten for his deeth so faste; And dampned al our werk that folweth so The blinde lust, the which that may not laste, And sholden al our herte on hevene caste. And forth he wente, shortly for to telle, Ther as Mercurie sorted him to dwelle.— 262 Swich fyn hath, lo, this Troilus for love, Swich fyn hath al his grete worthinesse; Swich fyn hath his estat real above, Swich fyn his lust, swich fyn hath his noblesse; Swich fyn hath false worldes brotelnesse. And thus bigan his lovinge of Criseyde, As I have told, and in this wyse he deyde. 263 O yonge fresshe folkes, he or she, In which that love up groweth with your age, Repeyreth hoom from worldly vanitee, And of your herte up-casteth the visage To thilke god that after his image Yow made, and thinketh al nis but a fayre This world, that passeth sone as floures fayre. 264 And loveth him, the which that right for love Upon a cros, our soules for to beye, First starf, and roos, and sit in hevene a-bove; For he nil falsen no wight, dar I seye, That wol his herte al hoolly on him leye. And sin he best to love is, and most meke, What nedeth feyned loves for to seke? 265 Lo here, of Payens corsed olde rytes, Lo here, what alle hir goddes may availle; Lo here, these wrecched worldes appetytes; Lo here, the fyn and guerdon for travaille Of Iove, Appollo, of Mars, of swich rascaille! Lo here, the forme of olde clerkes speche In poetrye, if ye hir bokes seche.— 266 O moral Gower, this book I directe To thee, and to the philosophical Strode, To vouchen sauf, ther nede is, to corecte, Of your benignitees and zeles gode. And to that sothfast Crist, that starf on rode, With al myn herte of mercy ever I preye; And to the lord right thus I speke and seye: 267 Thou oon, and two, and three, eterne on-lyve, That regnest ay in three and two and oon, Uncircumscript, and al mayst circumscryve, Us from visible and invisible foon Defende; and to thy mercy, everichoon, So make us, Iesus, for thy grace digne, For love of mayde and moder thyn benigne! Amen. Explicit Liber Troili et Criseydis.</field>

For hit is wonder, by the rode, To my wit, what causeth swevenes Either on morwes, or on evenes; And why the effect folweth of somme, And of somme hit shal never come; Why that is an avisioun, And this a revelacioun; Why this a dreem, why that a sweven, And nat to every man liche even; Why this a fantom, these oracles, I noot; but who-so of these miracles The causes knoweth bet than I, Devyne he; for I certeinly Ne can hem noght, ne never thinke To besily my wit to swinke, To knowe of hir signifiaunce The gendres, neither the distaunce Of tymes of hem, ne the causes For-why this more than that cause is; As if folkes complexiouns Make hem dreme of reflexiouns; Or elles thus, as other sayn, For to greet feblenesse of brayn, By abstinence, or by seeknesse, Prison, stewe, or greet distresse; Or elles by disordinaunce Of naturel acustomaunce, That som man is to curious In studie, or melancolious, Or thus, so inly ful of drede, That no man may him bote bede; Or elles, that devocioun Of somme, and contemplacioun Causeth swiche dremes ofte; Or that the cruel lyf unsofte Which these ilke lovers leden That hopen over muche or dreden, That purely hir impressiouns Causeth hem avisiouns; Or if that spirits have the might To make folk to dreme a-night Or if the soule, of propre kinde, Be so parfit, as men finde, That hit forwot that is to come, And that hit warneth alle and somme Of everiche of hir aventures By avisiouns, or by figures, But that our flesh ne hath no might To understonden hit aright, For hit is warned to derkly;— But why the cause is, noght wot I. Wel worthe, of this thing, grete clerkes, That trete of this and other werkes; For I of noon opinioun Nil as now make mencioun, But only that the holy rode Turne us every dreem to gode! For never, sith that I was born, Ne no man elles, me biforn, Mette, I trowe stedfastly, So wonderful a dreem as I The tenthe day [dide] of Decembre, The which, as I can now remembre, I wol yow tellen every del. The Invocation. But at my ginning, trusteth wel, I wol make invocacioun, With special devocioun, Unto the god of slepe anoon, That dwelleth in a cave of stoon Upon a streem that comth fro Lete, That is a flood of helle unswete; Besyde a folk men clepe Cimerie, Ther slepeth ay this god unmerie With his slepy thousand sones That alway for to slepe hir wone is— And to this god, that I of rede, Preye I, that he wol me spede My sweven for to telle aright, If every dreem stonde in his might. And he, that mover is of al That is and was, and ever shal, So yive hem Ioye that hit here Of alle that they dreme to-yere, And for to stonden alle in grace Of hir loves, or in what place That hem wer levest for to stonde, And shelde hem fro povert and shonde, And fro unhappe and ech disese, And sende hem al that may hem plese, That take hit wel, and scorne hit noght, Ne hit misdemen in her thoght Through malicious entencioun. And who-so, through presumpcioun, Or hate or scorne, or through envye, Dispyt, or Iape, or vilanye, Misdeme hit, preye I Iesus god That (dreme he barfoot, dreme he shod), That every harm that any man Hath had, sith [that] the world began, Befalle him therof, or he sterve, And graunte he mote hit ful deserve, Lo! with swich a conclusioun As had of his avisioun Cresus, that was king of Lyde, That high upon a gebet dyde! This prayer shal he have of me; I am no bet in charite! Now herkneth, as I have you seyd, What that I mette, or I abreyd. The Dream. Of Decembre the tenthe day, Whan hit was night, to slepe I lay Right ther as I was wont to done, And fil on slepe wonder sone, As he that wery was for-go On pilgrimage myles two To the corseynt Leonard, To make lythe of that was hard. But as I sleep, me mette I was Within a temple y-mad of glas; In whiche ther were mo images Of gold, stondinge in sondry stages, And mo riche tabernacles, And with perre mo pinacles, And mo curious portreytures, And queynte maner of figures Of olde werke, then I saw ever. For certeynly, I niste never Wher that I was, but wel wiste I, Hit was of Venus redely, The temple; for, in portreyture, I saw anoon-right hir figure Naked fletinge in a see. And also on hir heed, parde, Hir rose-garlond whyt and reed, And hir comb to kembe hir heed, Hir dowves, and daun Cupido, Hir blinde sone, and Vulcano, That in his face was ful broun. But as I romed up and doun, I fond that on a wal ther was Thus writen, on a table of bras: ‘I wol now singe, if that I can, The armes, and al-so the man, That first cam, through his destinee, Fugitif of Troye contree, In Itaile, with ful moche pyne, Unto the strondes of Lavyne.’ And tho began the story anoon, As I shal telle yow echoon. First saw I the destruccioun Of Troye, through the Greek Sinoun, [That] with his false forsweringe, And his chere and his lesinge Made the hors broght into Troye, Thorgh which Troyens loste al hir Ioye. And after this was grave, allas! How Ilioun assailed was And wonne, and king Priam y-slayn, And Polites his sone, certayn, Dispitously, of dan Pirrus. And next that saw I how Venus, Whan that she saw the castel brende, Doun fro the hevene gan descende, And bad hir sone Eneas flee; And how he fledde, and how that he Escaped was from al the pres, And took his fader, Anchises, And bar him on his bakke away, Cryinge, ‘Allas, and welaway!’ The whiche Anchises in his honde Bar the goddes of the londe, Thilke that unbrende were. And I saw next, in alle this fere, How Creusa, daun Eneas wyf, Which that he lovede as his lyf, And hir yonge sone Iulo, And eek Ascanius also, Fledden eek with drery chere, That hit was pitee for to here; And in a forest, as they wente, At a turninge of a wente, How Creusa was y-lost, allas! That deed, [but] noot I how, she was; How he hir soughte, and how hir gost Bad him to flee the Grekes ost, And seyde, he moste unto Itaile, As was his destinee, sauns faille; That hit was pitee for to here, Whan hir spirit gan appere, The wordes that she to him seyde, And for to kepe hir sone him preyde. Ther saw I graven eek how he, His fader eek, and his meynee, With his shippes gan to sayle Toward the contree of Itaile, As streight as that they mighte go. Ther saw I thee, cruel Iuno, That art daun Iupiteres wyf, That hast y-hated, al thy lyf, Al the Troyanisshe blood, Renne and crye, as thou were wood, On Eolus, the god of windes, To blowen out, of alle kindes, So loude, that he shulde drenche Lord and lady, grome and wenche Of al the Troyan nacioun, Withoute any savacioun. Ther saw I swich tempeste aryse, That every herte mighte agryse, To see hit peynted on the walle. Ther saw I graven eek withalle, Venus, how ye, my lady dere, Wepinge with ful woful chere, Prayen Iupiter an hye To save and kepe that navye Of the Troyan Eneas, Sith that he hir sone was. Ther saw I Ioves Venus kisse, And graunted of the tempest lisse. Ther saw I how the tempest stente, And how with alle pyne he wente, And prevely took arrivage In the contree of Cartage; And on the morwe, how that he And a knight, hight Achatee, Metten with Venus that day, Goinge in a queynt array, As she had ben an hunteresse, With wind blowinge upon hir tresse; How Eneas gan him to pleyne, Whan that he knew hir, of his peyne; And how his shippes dreynte were, Or elles lost, he niste where; How she gan him comforte tho, And bad him to Cartage go, And ther he shuldë his folk finde, That in the see were left behinde. And, shortly of this thing to pace, She made Eneas so in grace Of Dido, quene of that contree, That, shortly for to tellen, she Becam his love, and leet him do That that wedding longeth to. What shulde I speke more queynte, Or peyne me my wordes peynte, To speke of love? hit wol not be; I can not of that facultee. And eek to telle the manere How they aqueynteden in-fere, Hit were a long proces to telle, And over long for yow to dwelle. Ther saw I grave, how Eneas Tolde Dido every cas, That him was tid upon the see. And after grave was, how she Made of him, shortly, at oo word, Hir lyf, hir love, hir lust, hir lord; And dide him al the reverence, And leyde on him al the dispence, That any woman mighte do, Weninge hit had al be so, As he hir swoor; and her-by demed That he was good, for he swich semed. Allas! what harm doth apparence, Whan hit is fals in existence! For he to hir a traitour was; Wherfor she slow hir-self, allas! Lo, how a woman doth amis, To love him that unknowen is! For, by Crist, lo! thus hit fareth; ‘Hit is not al gold, that glareth.’ For, al-so brouke I wel myn heed, Ther may be under goodliheed Kevered many a shrewed vyce; Therfor be no wight so nyce, To take a love only for chere, For speche, or for frendly manere; For this shal every woman finde That som man, of his pure kinde, Wol shewen outward the faireste, Til he have caught that what him leste; And thanne wol he causes finde, And swere how that she is unkinde, Or fals, or prevy, or double was. Al this seye I by Eneas And Dido, and hir nyce lest, That lovede al to sone a gest; Therfor I wol seye a proverbe, That ‘he that fully knoweth therbe May saufly leye hit to his yë’; Withoute dreed, this is no lye. But let us speke of Eneas, How he betrayed hir, allas! And lefte hir ful unkindely. So whan she saw al-utterly, That he wolde hir of trouthe faile, And wende fro hir to Itaile, She gan to wringe hir hondes two. ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘what me is wo! Allas! is every man thus trewe, That every yere wolde have a newe, If hit so longe tyme dure, Or elles three, peraventure? As thus: of oon he wolde have fame In magnifying of his name; Another for frendship, seith he; And yet ther shal the thridde be, That shal be taken for delyt, Lo, or for singular profyt.’ In swiche wordes gan to pleyne Dido of hir grete peyne, As me mette redely; Non other auctour alegge I. ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘my swete herte, Have pitee on my sorwes smerte, And slee me not! go noght away! O woful Dido, wel away!’ Quod she to hir-selve tho. ‘O Eneas! what wil ye do? O, that your love, ne your bonde, That ye han sworn with your right honde, Ne my cruel deeth,’ quod she, ‘May holde yow still heer with me! O, haveth of my deeth pitee! Y-wis, my dere herte, ye Knowen ful wel that never yit, As fer-forth as I hadde wit, Agilte [I] yow in thoght ne deed. O, have ye men swich goodliheed In speche, and never a deel of trouthe? Allas, that ever hadde routhe Any woman on any man! Now see I wel, and telle can, We wrecched wimmen conne non art; For certeyn, for the more part, Thus we be served everichone. How sore that ye men conne grone, Anoon as we have yow receyved! Certeinly we ben deceyved; For, though your love laste a sesoun, Wayte upon the conclusioun, And eek how that ye determynen, And for the more part diffynen. ‘O, welawey that I was born! For through yow is my name lorn, And alle myn actes red and songe Over al this lond, on every tonge. O wikke Fame! for ther nis Nothing so swift, lo, as she is! O, sooth is, every thing is wist, Though hit be kevered with the mist. Eek, thogh I mighte duren ever, That I have doon, rekever I never, That I ne shal be seyd, allas, Y-shamed be through Eneas, And that I shal thus Iuged be— “Lo, right as she hath doon, now she Wol do eftsones, hardily;” Thus seyth the peple prevely.’— But that is doon, nis not to done; Al hir compleynt ne al hir mone, Certeyn, availeth hir not a stre. And whan she wiste sothly he Was forth unto his shippes goon, She in hir chambre wente anoon, And called on hir suster Anne, And gan hir to compleyne thanne; And seyde, that she cause was That she first lovede [Eneas], And thus counseilled hir therto. But what! when this was seyd and do, She roof hir-selve to the herte, And deyde through the wounde smerte. But al the maner how she deyde, And al the wordes that she seyde, Who-so to knowe hit hath purpos, Reed Virgile in Eneidos Or the Epistle of Ovyde, What that she wroot or that she dyde; And nere hit to long to endyte, By god, I woldë hit here wryte. But, welaway! the harm, the routhe, That hath betid for swich untrouthe, As men may ofte in bokes rede, And al day seen hit yet in dede, That for to thenken hit, a tene is. Lo, Demophon, duk of Athenis, How he forswor him ful falsly, And trayed Phillis wikkedly, That kinges doghter was of Trace, And falsly gan his terme pace; And when she wiste that he was fals, She heng hir-self right by the hals, For he had do hir swich untrouthe; Lo! was not this a wo and routhe? Eek lo! how fals and reccheles Was to Briseida Achilles, And Paris to Enone; And Iason to Isiphile; And eft Iason to Medea; And Ercules to Dyanira; For he lefte hir for Iöle, That made him cacche his deeth, parde. How fals eek was he, Theseus; That, as the story telleth us, How he betrayed Adriane; The devel be his soules bane! For had he laughed, had he loured, He mostë have be al devoured, If Adriane ne had y-be! And, for she had of him pitee, She made him fro the dethe escape, And he made hir a ful fals Iape; For after this, within a whyle He lefte hir slepinge in an yle, Deserte alone, right in the see, And stal away, and leet hir be; And took hir suster Phedra tho With him, and gan to shippe go. And yet he had y-sworn to here, On al that ever he mighte swere, That, so she saved him his lyf, He wolde have take hir to his wyf; For she desired nothing elles, In certein, as the book us telles. But to excusen Eneas Fulliche of al his greet trespas, The book seyth, Mercurie, sauns faile, Bad him go into Itaile, And leve Auffrykes regioun, And Dido and hir faire toun. Tho saw I grave, how to Itaile Daun Eneas is go to saile; And how the tempest al began, And how he loste his steresman, Which that the stere, or he took keep, Smot over-bord, lo! as he sleep. And also saw I how Sibyle And Eneas, besyde an yle, To helle wente, for to see His fader, Anchises the free. How he ther fond Palinurus, And Dido, and eek Deiphebus; And every tourment eek in helle Saw he, which is long to telle. Which who-so willeth for to knowe, He moste rede many a rowe On Virgile or on Claudian, Or Daunte, that hit telle can. Tho saw I grave al tharivaile That Eneas had in Itaile; And with king Latine his tretee, And alle the batailles that he Was at him-self, and eek his knightes, Or he had al y-wonne his rightes; And how he Turnus refte his lyf, And wan Lavyna to his wyf; And al the mervelous signals Of the goddes celestials; How, maugre Iuno, Eneas, For al hir sleighte and hir compas, Acheved al his aventure; For Iupiter took of him cure At the prayere of Venus; The whiche I preye alway save us, And us ay of our sorwes lighte! Whan I had seyen al this sighte In this noble temple thus, ‘A, Lord!’ thoughte I, ‘that madest us, Yet saw I never swich noblesse Of images, ne swich richesse, As I saw graven in this chirche; But not woot I who dide hem wirche, Ne wher I am, ne in what contree. But now wol I go out and see, Right at the wiket, if I can See o-wher stering any man, That may me telle wher I am.’ When I out at the dores cam, I faste aboute me beheld. Then saw I but a large feld, As fer as that I mighte see, Withouten toun, or hous, or tree, Or bush, or gras, or ered lond; For al the feld nas but of sond As smal as man may see yet lye In the desert of Libye; Ne I no maner creature, That is y-formed by nature, Ne saw, me [for] to rede or wisse. ‘O Crist,’ thoughte I, ‘that art in blisse, Fro fantom and illusioun Me save!’ and with devocioun Myn yën to the heven I caste. Tho was I war, lo! at the laste, That faste by the sonne, as hyë As kenne mighte I with myn yë, Me thoughte I saw an egle sore, But that hit semed moche more Then I had any egle seyn. But this as sooth as deeth, certeyn, Hit was of golde, and shoon so bright, That never saw men such a sighte, But-if the heven hadde y-wonne Al newe of golde another sonne; So shoon the egles fethres brighte, And somwhat dounward gan hit lighte.

This egle, of which I have yow told, That shoon with fethres as of gold, Which that so hyë gan to sore, I gan beholde more and more, To see hir beautee and the wonder; But never was ther dint of thonder, Ne that thing that men calle foudre, That smoot somtyme a tour to poudre, And in his swifte coming brende, That so swythe gan descende, As this foul, whan hit behelde That I a-roume was in the felde; And with his grimme pawes stronge, Within his sharpe nayles longe, Me, fleinge, at a swappe he hente, And with his sours agayn up wente, Me caryinge in his clawes starke As lightly as I were a larke, How high, I can not telle yow, For I cam up, I niste how. For so astonied and a-sweved Was every vertu in my heved, What with his sours and with my drede, That al my feling gan to dede; For-why hit was to greet affray. Thus I longe in his clawes lay, Til at the laste he to me spak In mannes vois, and seyde, ‘Awak! And be not so a-gast, for shame!’ And called me tho by my name. And, for I sholde the bet abreyde— Me mette—‘Awak,’ to me he seyde, Right in the same vois and stevene That useth oon I coude nevene; And with that vois, soth for to sayn, My minde cam to me agayn; For hit was goodly seyd to me, So nas hit never wont to be. And herwithal I gan to stere, And he me in his feet to bere, Til that he felte that I had hete, And felte eek tho myn herte bete. And tho gan he me to disporte, And with wordes to comforte, And sayde twyës, ‘Seynte Marie! Thou art noyous for to carie, And nothing nedeth hit, parde! For al-so wis god helpe me As thou non harm shalt have of this; And this cas, that betid thee is, Is for thy lore and for thy prow;— Let see! darst thou yet loke now? Be ful assured, boldely, I am thy frend.’ And therwith I Gan for to wondren in my minde. ‘O god,’ thoughte I, ‘that madest kinde, Shal I non other weyes dye? Wher Ioves wol me stellifye, Or what thing may this signifye? I neither am Enok, ne Elye, Ne Romulus, ne Ganymede That was y-bore up, as men rede, To hevene with dan Iupiter, And maad the goddes boteler.’ Lo! this was tho my fantasye! But he that bar me gan espye That I so thoghte, and seyde this:— ‘Thou demest of thy-self amis; For Ioves is not ther-aboute— I dar wel putte thee out of doute— To make of thee as yet a sterre. But er I bere thee moche ferre, I wol thee telle what I am, And whider thou shalt, and why I cam To done this, so that thou take Good herte, and not for fere quake.’ ‘Gladly,’ quod I. ‘Now wel,’ quod he:— ‘First I, that in my feet have thee, Of which thou hast a feer and wonder, Am dwelling with the god of thonder, Which that men callen Iupiter, That dooth me flee ful ofte fer To do al his comaundement. And for this cause he hath me sent To thee: now herke, by thy trouthe! Certeyn, he hath of thee routhe, That thou so longe trewely Hast served so ententifly His blinde nevew Cupido, And fair Venus [goddesse] also, Withoute guerdoun ever yit, And nevertheles hast set thy wit— Although that in thy hede ful lyte is— To make bokes, songes, dytees, In ryme, or elles in cadence, As thou best canst, in reverence Of Love, and of his servants eke, That have his servise soght, and seke; And peynest thee to preyse his art, Althogh thou haddest never part; Wherfor, al-so god me blesse, Ioves halt hit greet humblesse And vertu eek, that thou wolt make A-night ful ofte thyn heed to ake, In thy studie so thou wrytest, And ever-mo of love endytest, In honour of him and preysinges, And in his folkes furtheringes, And in hir matere al devysest, And noght him nor his folk despysest, Although thou mayst go in the daunce Of hem that him list not avaunce. ‘Wherfor, as I seyde, y-wis, Iupiter considereth this, And also, beau sir, other thinges; That is, that thou hast no tydinges Of Loves folk, if they be glade, Ne of noght elles that god made; And noght only fro fer contree That ther no tyding comth to thee, But of thy verray neyghebores, That dwellen almost at thy dores, Thou herest neither that ne this; For whan thy labour doon al is, And hast y-maad thy rekeninges, In stede of reste and newe thinges, Thou gost hoom to thy hous anoon; And, also domb as any stoon, Thou sittest at another boke, Til fully daswed is thy loke, And livest thus as an hermyte, Although thyn abstinence is lyte. ‘And therfor Ioves, through his grace, Wol that I bere thee to a place, Which that hight the Hous of Fame, To do thee som disport and game, In som recompensacioun Of labour and devocioun That thou hast had, lo! causeles, To Cupido, the reccheles! And thus this god, thorgh his meryte, Wol with som maner thing thee quyte, So that thou wolt be of good chere. For truste wel, that thou shalt here, When we be comen ther I seye, Mo wonder thinges, dar I leye, Of Loves folke mo tydinges, Bothe soth-sawes and lesinges; And mo loves newe begonne, And longe y-served loves wonne, And mo loves casuelly That been betid, no man wot why, But as a blind man stert an hare; And more Iolytee and fare, Whyl that they finde love of stele, As thinketh hem, and over-al wele; Mo discords, and mo Ielousyes, Mo murmurs, and mo novelryes, And mo dissimulaciouns, And feyned reparaciouns; And mo berdes in two houres Withoute rasour or sisoures Y-maad, then greynes be of sondes; And eke mo holdinge in hondes, And also mo renovelaunces Of olde forleten aqueyntaunces; Mo love-dayes and acordes Then on instruments ben cordes; And eke of loves mo eschaunges Than ever cornes were in graunges; Unethe maistow trowen this?’— Quod he. ‘No, helpe me god so wis!’— Quod I. ‘No? why?’ quod he. ‘For hit Were impossible, to my wit, Though that Fame hadde al the pyes In al a realme, and al the spyes, How that yet she shulde here al this, Or they espye hit.’ ‘O yis, yis!’ Quod he to me, ‘that can I preve By resoun, worthy for to leve, So that thou yeve thyn advertence To understonde my sentence. ‘First shalt thou heren wher she dwelleth, And so thyn owne book hit telleth; Hir paleys stant, as I shal seye, Right even in middes of the weye Betwixen hevene, erthe, and see; That, what-so-ever in al these three Is spoken, in privee or aperte, The wey therto is so overte, And stant eek in so Iuste a place, That every soun mot to hit pace, Or what so comth fro any tonge, Be hit rouned, red, or songe, Or spoke in seurtee or drede, Certein, hit moste thider nede. ‘Now herkne wel; for-why I wille Tellen thee a propre skile, And worthy demonstracioun In myn imagynacioun. ‘Geffrey, thou wost right wel this, That every kindly thing that is, Hath a kindly stede ther he May best in hit conserved be; Unto which place every thing, Through his kindly enclyning, Moveth for to come to, Whan that hit is awey therfro; As thus; lo, thou mayst al day see That any thing that hevy be, As stoon or leed, or thing of wighte, And ber hit never so hye on highte, Lat go thyn hand, hit falleth doun. ‘Right so seye I by fyre or soun, Or smoke, or other thinges lighte, Alwey they seke upward on highte; Whyl ech of hem is at his large, Light thing up, and dounward charge. ‘And for this cause mayst thou see, That every river to the see Enclyned is to go, by kinde. And by these skilles, as I finde, Hath fish dwellinge in floode and see, And treës eek in erthe be. Thus every thing, by this resoun, Hath his propre mansioun, To which hit seketh to repaire, As ther hit shulde not apaire. Lo, this sentence is knowen couthe Of every philosophres mouthe, As Aristotle and dan Platon, And other clerkes many oon; And to confirme my resoun, Thou wost wel this, that speche is soun, Or elles no man mighte hit here; Now herkne what I wol thee lere. ‘Soun is noght but air y-broken, And every speche that is spoken, Loud or privee, foul or fair, In his substaunce is but air; For as flaumbe is but lighted smoke, Right so soun is air y-broke. But this may be in many wyse, Of which I wil thee two devyse, As soun that comth of pype or harpe. For whan a pype is blowen sharpe, The air is twist with violence, And rent; lo, this is my sentence; Eek, whan men harpe-stringes smyte, Whether hit be moche or lyte, Lo, with the strook the air to-breketh; Right so hit breketh whan men speketh. Thus wost thou wel what thing is speche. ‘Now hennesforth I wol thee teche, How every speche, or noise, or soun, Through his multiplicacioun, Thogh hit were pyped of a mouse, Moot nede come to Fames House. I preve hit thus—tak hede now— By experience; for if that thou Throwe on water now a stoon, Wel wost thou, hit wol make anoon A litel roundel as a cercle, Paraventure brood as a covercle; And right anoon thou shalt see weel, That wheel wol cause another wheel, And that the thridde, and so forth, brother, Every cercle causing other, Wyder than himselve was; And thus, fro roundel to compas, Ech aboute other goinge, Caused of othres steringe, And multiplying ever-mo, Til that hit be so fer y-go That hit at bothe brinkes be. Al-thogh thou mowe hit not y-see Above, hit goth yet alway under, Although thou thenke hit a gret wonder. And who-so seith of trouthe I varie, Bid him proven the contrarie. And right thus every word, y-wis, That loude or privee spoken is, Moveth first an air aboute, And of this moving, out of doute, Another air anoon is meved, As I have of the water preved, That every cercle causeth other. Right so of air, my leve brother; Everich air in other stereth More and more, and speche up bereth, Or vois, or noise, or word, or soun, Ay through multiplicacioun, Til hit be atte House of Fame;— Tak hit in ernest or in game. ‘Now have I told, if thou have minde, How speche or soun, of pure kinde, Enclyned is upward to meve; This, mayst thou fele, wel I preve. And that [the mansioun], y-wis, That every thing enclyned to is, Hath his kindeliche stede: That sheweth hit, withouten drede, That kindely the mansioun Of every speche, of every soun, Be hit either foul or fair, Hath his kinde place in air. And sin that every thing, that is Out of his kinde place, y-wis, Moveth thider for to go If hit a-weye be therfro, As I before have preved thee, Hit seweth, every soun, pardee, Moveth kindely to pace Al up into his kindely place. And this place of which I telle, Ther as Fame list to dwelle, Is set amiddes of these three, Heven, erthe, and eek the see, As most conservatif the soun. Than is this the conclusioun, That every speche of every man, As I thee telle first began, Moveth up on high to pace Kindely to Fames place. ‘Telle me this feithfully, Have I not preved thus simply, Withouten any subtiltee Of speche, or gret prolixitee Of termes of philosophye, Of figures of poetrye, Or colours of rethoryke? Pardee, hit oghte thee to lyke; For hard langage and hard matere Is encombrous for to here At ones; wost thou not wel this?’ And I answerde, and seyde, ‘Yis.’ ‘A ha!’ quod he, ‘lo, so I can Lewedly to a lewed man Speke, and shewe him swiche skiles, That he may shake hem by the biles, So palpable they shulden be. But tel me this, now pray I thee, How thinkth thee my conclusioun?’ [Quod he]. ‘A good persuasioun,’ Quod I, ‘hit is; and lyk to be Right so as thou hast preved me.’ ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘and as I leve, Thou shalt have yit, or hit be eve, Of every word of this sentence A preve, by experience; And with thyn eres heren wel Top and tail, and everydel, That every word that spoken is Comth into Fames Hous, y-wis, As I have seyd; what wilt thou more?’ And with this word upper to sore He gan, and seyde, ‘By Seynt Iame! Now wil we speken al of game.’— ‘How farest thou?’ quod he to me. ‘Wel,’ quod I. ‘Now see,’ quod he, ‘By thy trouthe, yond adoun, Wher that thou knowest any toun, Or hous, or any other thing. And whan thou hast of ought knowing, Loke that thou warne me, And I anoon shal telle thee How fer that thou art now therfro.’ And I adoun gan loken tho, And beheld feldes and plaines, And now hilles, and now mountaines, Now valeys, and now forestes, And now, unethes, grete bestes; Now riveres, now citees, Now tounes, and now grete trees, Now shippes sailinge in the see. But thus sone in a whyle he Was flowen fro the grounde so hyë, That al the world, as to myn yë, No more semed than a prikke; Or elles was the air so thikke That I ne mighte not discerne. With that he spak to me as yerne, And seyde: ‘Seestow any [toun] Or ought thou knowest yonder doun?’ I seyde, ‘Nay.’ ‘No wonder nis,’ Quod he, ‘for half so high as this Nas Alexander Macedo; Ne the king, dan Scipio, That saw in dreme, at point devys, Helle and erthe, and paradys; Ne eek the wrecche Dedalus, Ne his child, nyce Icarus, That fleigh so highe that the hete His winges malt, and he fel wete In-mid the see, and ther he dreynte, For whom was maked moch compleynte. ‘Now turn upward,’ quod he, ‘thy face, And behold this large place, This air; but loke thou ne be Adrad of hem that thou shalt see; For in this regioun, certein, Dwelleth many a citezein, Of which that speketh dan Plato. These ben the eyrish bestes, lo!’ And so saw I al that meynee Bothe goon and also flee. ‘Now,’ quod he tho, ‘cast up thyn yë; See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë, Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hit is whyt: and somme, parfey, Callen hit Watlinge Strete: That ones was y-brent with hete, Whan the sonnes sone, the rede, That highte Pheton, wolde lede Algate his fader cart, and gye. The cart-hors gonne wel espye That he ne coude no governaunce, And gonne for to lepe and launce, And beren him now up, now doun, Til that he saw the Scorpioun, Which that in heven a signe is yit. And he, for ferde, loste his wit, Of that, and leet the reynes goon Of his hors; and they anoon Gonne up to mounte, and doun descende Til bothe the eyr and erthe brende; Til Iupiter, lo, atte laste, Him slow, and fro the carte caste. Lo, is it not a greet mischaunce, To lete a fole han governaunce Of thing that he can not demeine?’ And with this word, soth for to seyne, He gan alway upper to sore, And gladded me ay more and more, So feithfully to me spak he. Tho gan I loken under me, And beheld the eyrish bestes, Cloudes, mistes, and tempestes, Snowes, hailes, reines, windes, And thengendring in hir kindes, And al the wey through whiche I cam; ‘O god,’ quod I, ‘that made Adam, Moche is thy might and thy noblesse!’ And tho thoughte I upon Boëce, That writ, ‘a thought may flee so hyë, With fetheres of Philosophye, To passen everich element; And whan he hath so fer y-went, Than may be seen, behind his bak, Cloud, and al that I of spak.’ Tho gan I wexen in a were, And seyde, ‘I woot wel I am here; But wher in body or in gost I noot, y-wis; but god, thou wost!’ For more cleer entendement Nadde he me never yit y-sent. And than thoughte I on Marcian, And eek on Anteclaudian, That sooth was hir descripcioun Of al the hevenes regioun, As fer as that I saw the preve; Therfor I can hem now beleve. With that this egle gan to crye: ‘Lat be,’ quod he, ‘thy fantasye; Wilt thou lere of sterres aught?’ ‘Nay, certeinly,’ quod I, ‘right naught; And why? for I am now to old.’ ‘Elles I wolde thee have told,’ Quod he, ‘the sterres names, lo, And al the hevenes signes to, And which they been.’ ‘No fors,’ quod I. ‘Yis, pardee,’ quod he; ‘wostow why? For whan thou redest poetrye, How goddes gonne stellifye Brid, fish, beste, or him or here, As the Raven, or either Bere, Or Ariones harpe fyn, Castor, Pollux, or Delphyn, Or Atlantes doughtres sevene, How alle these arn set in hevene; For though thou have hem ofte on honde, Yet nostow not wher that they stonde.’ ‘No fors,’ quod I, ‘hit is no nede; I leve as wel, so god me spede, Hem that wryte of this matere, As though I knew hir places here; And eek they shynen here so brighte, Hit shulde shenden al my sighte, To loke on hem.’ ‘That may wel be,’ Quod he. And so forth bar he me A whyl, and than he gan to crye, That never herde I thing so hye, ‘Now up the heed; for al is wel; Seynt Iulyan, lo, bon hostel! See here the House of Fame, lo! Maistow not heren that I do?’ ‘What?’ quod I. ‘The grete soun,’ Quod he, ‘that rumbleth up and doun In Fames Hous, ful of tydinges, Bothe of fair speche and chydinges, And of fals and soth compouned. Herkne wel; hit is not rouned. Herestow not the grete swogh?’ ‘Yis, pardee,’ quod I, ‘wel y-nogh.’ ‘And what soun is it lyk?’ quod he. ‘Peter! lyk beting of the see,’ Quod I, ‘again the roches holowe, Whan tempest doth the shippes swalowe; And lat a man stonde, out of doute, A myle thens, and here hit route; Or elles lyk the last humblinge After the clappe of a thundringe, When Ioves hath the air y-bete; But hit doth me for fere swete.’ ‘Nay, dred thee not therof,’ quod he, ‘Hit is nothing wil byten thee; Thou shalt non harm have, trewely.’ And with this word bothe he and I As nigh the place arryved were As men may casten with a spere. I nistë how, but in a strete He sette me faire on my fete, And seyde, ‘Walke forth a pas, And tak thyn aventure or cas, That thou shalt finde in Fames place.’ ‘Now,’ quod I, ‘whyl we han space To speke, or that I go fro thee, For the love of god, tel me, In sooth, that wil I of thee lere, If this noise that I here Be, as I have herd thee tellen, Of folk that doun in erthe dwellen, And comth here in the same wyse As I thee herde or this devyse; And that ther lyves body nis In al that hous that yonder is, That maketh al this loude fare?’ ‘No,’ quod he, ‘by Seynte Clare, And also wis god rede me! But o thinge I wil warne thee Of the which thou wolt have wonder. Lo, to the House of Fame yonder Thou wost how cometh every speche, Hit nedeth noght thee eft to teche. But understond now right wel this; Whan any speche y-comen is Up to the paleys, anon-right Hit wexeth lyk the same wight, Which that the word in erthe spak, Be hit clothed reed or blak; And hath so verray his lyknesse That spak the word, that thou wilt gesse That hit the same body be, Man or woman, he or she. And is not this a wonder thing?’ ‘Yis,’ quod I tho, ‘by hevene king!’ And with this worde, ‘Farwel,’ quod he, ‘And here I wol abyden thee; And god of hevene sende thee grace, Som good to lernen in this place.’ And I of him took leve anoon, And gan forth to the paleys goon. Explicit liber secundus. BOOK III. Incipit liber tercius. Invocation. O god of science and of light, Apollo, through thy grete might, This litel laste book thou gye! Nat that I wilne, for maistrye, Here art poetical be shewed; But, for the rym is light and lewed, Yit make hit sumwhat agreable, Though som vers faile in a sillable; And that I do no diligence To shewe craft, but o sentence. And if, divyne vertu, thou Wilt helpe me to shewe now That in myn hede y-marked is— Lo, that is for to menen this, The Hous of Fame to descryve— Thou shalt see me go, as blyve, Unto the nexte laure I see, And kisse hit, for hit is thy tree; Now entreth in my breste anoon!— The Dream. Whan I was fro this egle goon, I gan beholde upon this place. And certein, or I ferther pace, I wol yow al the shap devyse Of hous and site; and al the wyse How I gan to this place aproche That stood upon so high a roche, Hyer stant ther noon in Spaine. But up I clomb with alle paine, And though to climbe hit greved me, Yit I ententif was to see, And for to pouren wonder lowe, If I coude any weyes knowe What maner stoon this roche was; For hit was lyk a thing of glas, But that hit shoon ful more clere; But of what congeled matere Hit was, I niste redely. But at the laste espyed I, And found that hit was, every deel, A roche of yse, and not of steel. Thoughte I, ‘By Seynt Thomas of Kent! This were a feble foundement To bilden on a place hye; He oughte him litel glorifye That her-on bilt, god so me save!’ Tho saw I al the half y-grave With famous folkes names fele, That had y-been in mochel wele, And hir fames wyde y-blowe. But wel unethes coude I knowe Any lettres for to rede Hir names by; for, out of drede, They were almost of-thowed so, That of the lettres oon or two Was molte away of every name, So unfamous was wexe hir fame; But men seyn, ‘What may ever laste?’ Tho gan I in myn herte caste, That they were molte awey with hete, And not awey with stormes bete. For on that other syde I sey Of this hille, that northward lay, How hit was writen ful of names Of folk that hadden grete fames Of olde tyme, and yit they were As fresshe as men had writen hem there The selve day right, or that houre That I upon hem gan to poure. But wel I wiste what hit made; Hit was conserved with the shade— Al this wrytinge that I sy— Of a castel, that stood on hy, And stood eek on so cold a place, That hete mighte hit not deface. Tho gan I up the hille to goon, And fond upon the coppe a woon, That alle the men that ben on lyve Ne han the cunning to descryve The beautee of that ilke place, Ne coude casten no compace Swich another for to make, That mighte of beautee be his make, Ne [be] so wonderliche y-wrought; That hit astonieth yit my thought, And maketh al my wit to swinke On this castel to bethinke. So that the grete craft, beautee, The cast, the curiositee Ne can I not to yow devyse, My wit ne may me not suffyse. But natheles al the substance I have yit in my remembrance; For-why me thoughte, by Seynt Gyle! Al was of stone of beryle, Bothe castel and the tour, And eek the halle, and every bour, Withouten peces or Ioininges. But many subtil compassinges, Babewinnes and pinacles, Imageries and tabernacles, I saw; and ful eek of windowes, As flakes falle in grete snowes. And eek in ech of the pinacles Weren sondry habitacles, In whiche stoden, al withoute— Ful the castel, al aboute— Of alle maner of minstrales, And gestiours, that tellen tales Bothe of weping and of game, Of al that longeth unto Fame. Ther herde I pleyen on an harpe That souned bothe wel and sharpe, Orpheus ful craftely, And on his syde, faste by, Sat the harper Orion, And Eacides Chiron, And other harpers many oon, And the Bret Glascurion; And smale harpers with her gleës Seten under hem in seës, And gonne on hem upward to gape, And countrefete hem as an ape, Or as craft countrefeteth kinde. Tho saugh I stonden hem behinde, A-fer fro hem, al by hemselve, Many thousand tymes twelve, That maden loude menstralcyes In cornemuse and shalmyes, And many other maner pype, That craftely begunne pype Bothe in doucet and in rede, That ben at festes with the brede; And many floute and lilting-horne, And pypes made of grene corne, As han thise litel herde-gromes, That kepen bestes in the bromes. Ther saugh I than Atiteris, And of Athenes dan Pseustis, And Marcia that lost her skin, Bothe in face, body, and chin, For that she wolde envyen, lo! To pypen bet then Apollo. Ther saugh I famous, olde and yonge, Pypers of the Duche tonge, To lerne love-daunces, springes, Reyes, and these straunge thinges. Tho saugh I in another place Stonden in a large space, Of hem that maken blody soun In trumpe, beme, and clarioun; For in fight and blood-shedinge Is used gladly clarioninge. Ther herde I trumpen Messenus, Of whom that speketh Virgilius. Ther herde I Ioab trumpe also, Theodomas, and other mo; And alle that used clarion In Cataloigne and Aragon, That in hir tyme famous were To lerne, saugh I trumpe there. Ther saugh I sitte in other seës, Pleyinge upon sondry gleës, Whiche that I cannot nevene, Mo then sterres been in hevene, Of whiche I nil as now not ryme, For ese of yow, and losse of tyme: For tyme y-lost, this knowen ye, By no way may recovered be. Ther saugh I pleyen Iogelours, Magiciens and tregetours, And phitonesses, charmeresses, Olde wicches, sorceresses, That use exorsisaciouns, And eek thise fumigaciouns; And clerkes eek, which conne wel Al this magyke naturel, That craftely don hir ententes, To make, in certeyn ascendentes, Images, lo, through which magyk To make a man ben hool or syk. Ther saugh I thee, queen Medea, And Circes eke, and Calipsa; Ther saugh I Hermes Ballenus, Lymote, and eek Simon Magus.— Ther saugh I, and knew hem by name, That by such art don men han fame. Ther saugh I Colle tregetour Upon a table of sicamour Pleye an uncouthe thing to telle; I saugh him carien a wind-melle Under a walsh-note shale. What shuld I make lenger tale Of al the peple that I say, Fro hennes in-to domesday? Whan I had al this folk beholde, And fond me lous, and noght y-holde, And eft y-mused longe whyle Upon these walles of beryle, That shoon ful lighter than a glas, And made wel more than hit was To semen, every thing, y-wis, As kinde thing of fames is; I gan forth romen til I fond The castel-yate on my right hond, Which that so wel corven was That never swich another nas; And yit hit was by aventure Y-wrought, as often as by cure. Hit nedeth noght yow for to tellen, To make yow to longe dwellen, Of this yates florisshinges, Ne of compasses, ne of kervinges, Ne how they hatte in masoneries, As, corbets fulle of imageries. But, lord! so fair hit was to shewe, For hit was al with gold behewe. But in I wente, and that anoon; Ther mette I crying many oon,— ‘A larges, larges, hold up wel! God save the lady of this pel, Our owne gentil lady Fame, And hem that wilnen to have name Of us!’ Thus herde I cryen alle, And faste comen out of halle, And shoken nobles and sterlinges. And somme crouned were as kinges, With crounes wroght ful of losenges; And many riban, and many frenges Were on hir clothes trewely. Tho atte laste aspyed I That pursevauntes and heraudes, That cryen riche folkes laudes, Hit weren alle; and every man Of hem, as I yow tellen can, Had on him throwen a vesture, Which that men clepe a cote-armure, Enbrowded wonderliche riche, Al-though they nere nought y-liche. But noght nil I, so mote I thryve, Been aboute to discryve Al these armes that ther weren, That they thus on hir cotes beren, For hit to me were impossible; Men mighte make of hem a bible Twenty foot thikke, as I trowe. For certeyn, who-so coude y-knowe Mighte ther alle the armes seen Of famous folk that han y-been In Auffrike, Europe, and Asye, Sith first began the chevalrye. Lo! how shulde I now telle al this? Ne of the halle eek what nede is To tellen yow, that every wal Of hit, and floor, and roof and al Was plated half a fote thikke Of gold, and that nas no-thing wikke, But, for to prove in alle wyse, As fyn as ducat in Venyse, Of whiche to lyte al in my pouche is? And they wer set as thikke of nouchis Fulle of the fynest stones faire, That men rede in the Lapidaire, As greses growen in a mede; But hit were al to longe to rede The names; and therfore I pace. But in this riche lusty place, That Fames halle called was, Ful moche prees of folk ther nas, Ne crouding, for to mochil prees. But al on hye, above a dees, Sitte in a see imperial, That maad was of a rubee al, Which that a carbuncle is y-called, I saugh, perpetually y-stalled, A feminyne creature; That never formed by nature Nas swich another thing y-seye. For altherfirst, soth for to seye, Me thoughte that she was so lyte, That the lengthe of a cubyte Was lenger than she semed be; But thus sone, in a whyle, she Hir tho so wonderliche streighte, That with hir feet she therthe reighte, And with hir heed she touched hevene, Ther as shynen sterres sevene. And ther-to eek, as to my wit, I saugh a gretter wonder yit, Upon hir eyen to beholde; But certeyn I hem never tolde; For as fele eyen hadde she As fetheres upon foules be, Or weren on the bestes foure, That goddes trone gunne honoure, As Iohn writ in thapocalips. Hir heer, that oundy was and crips, As burned gold hit shoon to see. And sooth to tellen, also she Had also fele up-stonding eres And tonges, as on bestes heres; And on hir feet wexen saugh I Partriches winges redely. But, lord! the perrie and the richesse I saugh sitting on this goddesse! And, lord! the hevenish melodye Of songes, ful of armonye, I herde aboute her trone y-songe, That al the paleys-walles ronge! So song the mighty Muse, she That cleped is Caliopee, And hir eighte sustren eke, That in hir face semen meke; And evermo, eternally, They songe of Fame, as tho herde I:— ‘Heried be thou and thy name, Goddesse of renoun and of fame!’ Tho was I war, lo, atte laste, As I myn eyen gan up caste, That this ilke noble quene On hir shuldres gan sustene Bothe tharmes and the name Of tho that hadde large fame; Alexander, and Hercules That with a sherte his lyf lees! Thus fond I sitting this goddesse, In nobley, honour, and richesse; Of which I stinte a whyle now, Other thing to tellen yow. Tho saugh I stonde on either syde, Streight doun to the dores wyde, Fro the dees, many a pileer Of metal, that shoon not ful cleer; But though they nere of no richesse, Yet they were maad for greet noblesse, And in hem greet [and hy] sentence; And folk of digne reverence, Of whiche I wol yow telle fonde, Upon the piler saugh I stonde. Alderfirst, lo, ther I sigh, Upon a piler stonde on high, That was of lede and yren fyn, Him of secte Saturnyn, The Ebrayk Iosephus, the olde, That of Iewes gestes tolde; And bar upon his shuldres hye The fame up of the Iewerye. And by him stoden other sevene, Wyse and worthy for to nevene, To helpen him bere up the charge, Hit was so hevy and so large. And for they writen of batailes, As wel as other olde mervailes, Therfor was, lo, this pileer, Of which that I yow telle heer, Of lede and yren bothe, y-wis. For yren Martes metal is, Which that god is of bataile; And the leed, withouten faile, Is, lo, the metal of Saturne, That hath ful large wheel to turne. Tho stoden forth, on every rowe, Of hem which that I coude knowe, Thogh I hem noght by ordre telle, To make yow to long to dwelle. These, of whiche I ginne rede, Ther saugh I stonden, out of drede: Upon an yren piler strong, That peynted was, al endelong, With tygres blode in every place, The Tholosan that highte Stace, That bar of Thebes up the fame Upon his shuldres, and the name Also of cruel Achilles. And by him stood, withouten lees, Ful wonder hye on a pileer Of yren, he, the gret Omeer; And with him Dares and Tytus Before, and eek he, Lollius, And Guido eek de Columpnis, And English Gaufride eek, y-wis; And ech of these, as have I Ioye, Was besy for to bere up Troye. So hevy ther-of was the fame, That for to bere hit was no game. But yit I gan ful wel espye, Betwix hem was a litel envye. Oon seyde, Omere made lyes, Feyninge in his poetryes, And was to Grekes favorable; Therfor held he hit but fable. Tho saugh I stonde on a pileer, That was of tinned yren cleer, That Latin poete, [dan] Virgyle, That bore hath up a longe whyle The fame of Pius Eneas. And next him on a piler was, Of coper, Venus clerk, Ovyde, That hath y-sowen wonder wyde The grete god of Loves name. And ther he bar up wel his fame, Upon this piler, also hye As I might see hit with myn yë: For-why this halle, of whiche I rede Was woxe on highte, lengthe and brede, Wel more, by a thousand del, Than hit was erst, that saugh I wel. Tho saugh I, on a piler by, Of yren wroght ful sternely, The grete poete, daun Lucan, And on his shuldres bar up than, As highe as that I mighte see, The fame of Iulius and Pompee. And by him stoden alle these clerkes, That writen of Romes mighty werkes, That, if I wolde hir names telle, Al to longe moste I dwelle. And next him on a piler stood Of soulfre, lyk as he were wood, Dan Claudian, the soth to telle, That bar up al the fame of helle, Of Pluto, and of Proserpyne, That quene is of the derke pyne. What shulde I more telle of this? The halle was al ful, y-wis, Of hem that writen olde gestes, As ben on treës rokes nestes; But hit a ful confus matere Were al the gestes for to here, That they of write, and how they highte. But whyl that I beheld this sighte, I herde a noise aprochen blyve, That ferde as been don in an hyve, Agen her tyme of out-fleyinge; Right swiche a maner murmuringe, For al the world, hit semed me. Tho gan I loke aboute and see, That ther com entring in the halle A right gret company with-alle, And that of sondry regiouns, Of alleskinnes condiciouns, That dwelle in erthe under the mone, Pore and ryche. And also sone As they were come into the halle, They gonne doun on kneës falle Before this ilke noble quene, And seyde, ‘Graunte us, lady shene, Ech of us, of thy grace, a bone!’ And somme of hem she graunted sone, And somme she werned wel and faire; And somme she graunted the contraire Of hir axing utterly. But thus I seye yow trewely, What hir cause was, I niste. For this folk, ful wel I wiste, They hadde good fame ech deserved, Althogh they were diversly served; Right as hir suster, dame Fortune, Is wont to serven in comune. Now herkne how she gan to paye That gonne hir of hir grace praye; And yit, lo, al this companye Seyden sooth, and noght a lye. ‘Madame,’ seyden they, ‘we be Folk that heer besechen thee, That thou graunte us now good fame, And lete our werkes han that name; In ful recompensacioun Of good werk, give us good renoun.’ ‘I werne yow hit,’ quod she anoon, ‘Ye gete of me good fame noon, By god! and therfor go your wey.’ ‘Alas,’ quod they, ‘and welaway! Telle us, what may your cause be?’ ‘For me list hit noght,’ quod she; ‘No wight shal speke of yow, y-wis, Good ne harm, ne that ne this.’ And with that word she gan to calle Hir messanger, that was in halle, And bad that he shulde faste goon, Up peyne to be blind anoon, For Eolus, the god of winde;— ‘In Trace ther ye shul him finde, And bid him bringe his clarioun, That is ful dyvers of his soun, And hit is cleped Clere Laude, With which he wont is to heraude Hem that me list y-preised be: And also bid him how that he Bringe his other clarioun, That highte Sclaundre in every toun, With which he wont is to diffame Hem that me list, and do hem shame.’ This messanger gan faste goon, And found wher, in a cave of stoon, In a contree that highte Trace, This Eolus, with harde grace, Held the windes in distresse, And gan hem under him to presse, That they gonne as beres rore, He bond and pressed hem so sore. This messanger gan faste crye, ‘Rys up,’ quod he, ‘and faste hye, Til that thou at my lady be; And tak thy clarions eek with thee, And speed thee forth.’ And he anon Took to a man, that hight Triton, His clariouns to bere tho, And leet a certeyn wind to go, That blew so hidously and hye, That hit ne lefte not a skye In al the welken longe and brood. This Eolus no-wher abood Til he was come at Fames feet, And eek the man that Triton heet; And ther he stood, as still as stoon. And her-withal ther com anoon Another huge companye Of gode folk, and gunne crye, ‘Lady, graunte us now good fame, And lat our werkes han that name Now, in honour of gentilesse, And also god your soule blesse! For we han wel deserved hit, Therfor is right that we ben quit.’ ‘As thryve I,’ quod she, ‘ye shal faile, Good werkes shal yow noght availe To have of me good fame as now. But wite ye what? I graunte yow, That ye shal have a shrewed fame And wikked loos, and worse name, Though ye good loos have wel deserved. Now go your wey, for ye be served; And thou, dan Eolus, let see! Tak forth thy trumpe anon,’ quod she, ‘That is y-cleped Sclaunder light, And blow hir loos, that every wight Speke of hem harm and shrewednesse, In stede of good and worthinesse. For thou shalt trumpe al the contraire Of that they han don wel or faire.’ ‘Alas,’ thoughte I, ‘what aventures Han these sory creatures! For they, amonges al the pres, Shul thus be shamed gilteles! But what! hit moste nedes be.’ What did this Eolus, but he Tok out his blakke trumpe of bras, That fouler than the devil was, And gan this trumpe for to blowe, As al the world shulde overthrowe; That through-out every regioun Wente this foule trumpes soun, As swift as pelet out of gonne, Whan fyr is in the poudre ronne. And swiche a smoke gan out-wende Out of his foule trumpes ende, Blak, blo, grenish, swartish reed, As doth wher that men melte leed, Lo, al on high fro the tuel! And therto oo thing saugh I wel, That, the ferther that hit ran, The gretter wexen hit began, As doth the river from a welle, And hit stank as the pit of helle. Alas, thus was hir shame y-ronge, And giltelees, on every tonge. Tho com the thridde companye, And gunne up to the dees to hye, And doun on knees they fille anon, And seyde, ‘We ben everichon Folk that han ful trewely Deserved fame rightfully, And praye yow, hit mot be knowe, Right as hit is, and forth y-blowe.’ ‘I graunte,’ quod she, ‘for me list That now your gode werk be wist; And yit ye shul han better loos, Right in dispyt of alle your foos, Than worthy is; and that anoon: Lat now,’ quod she, ‘thy trumpe goon, Thou Eolus, that is so blak; And out thyn other trumpe tak That highte Laude, and blow hit so That through the world hir fame go Al esely, and not to faste, That hit be knowen atte laste.’ ‘Ful gladly, lady myn,’ he seyde; And out his trumpe of golde he brayde Anon, and sette hit to his mouthe, And blew hit est, and west, and southe, And north, as loude as any thunder, That every wight hadde of hit wonder, So brode hit ran, or than hit stente. And, certes, al the breeth that wente Out of his trumpes mouthe smelde As men a pot-ful bawme helde Among a basket ful of roses; This favour dide he til hir loses. And right with this I gan aspye, Ther com the ferthe companye— But certeyn they were wonder fewe— And gonne stonden in a rewe, And seyden, ‘Certes, lady brighte, We han don wel with al our mighte; But we ne kepen have no fame. Hyd our werkes and our name, For goddes love! for certes we Han certeyn doon hit for bountee, And for no maner other thing.’ ‘I graunte yow al your asking,’ Quod she; ‘let your werk be deed.’ With that aboute I clew myn heed, And saugh anoon the fifte route That to this lady gonne loute, And doun on knees anoon to falle; And to hir tho besoughten alle To hyde hir gode werkes eek, And seyde, they yeven noght a leek For fame, ne for swich renoun; For they, for contemplacioun And goddes love, hadde y-wrought; Ne of fame wolde they nought. ‘What?’ quod she, ‘and be ye wood? And wene ye for to do good, And for to have of that no fame? Have ye dispyt to have my name? Nay, ye shul liven everichoon! Blow thy trumpe and that anoon,’ Quod she, ‘thou Eolus, I hote, And ring this folkes werk by note, That al the world may of hit here.’ And he gan blowe hir loos so clere In his golden clarioun, That through the world wente the soun, So kenely, and eek so softe; But atte laste hit was on-lofte. Thoo com the sexte companye, And gonne faste on Fame crye. Right verraily, in this manere They seyden: ‘Mercy, lady dere! To telle certein, as hit is, We han don neither that ne this, But ydel al our lyf y-be. But, natheles, yit preye we, That we mowe han so good a fame, And greet renoun and knowen name, As they that han don noble gestes, And acheved alle hir lestes, As wel of love as other thing; Al was us never broche ne ring, Ne elles nought, from wimmen sent, Ne ones in hir herte y-ment To make us only frendly chere, But mighte temen us on bere; Yit lat us to the peple seme Swiche as the world may of us deme, That wimmen loven us for wood. Hit shal don us as moche good, And to our herte as moche availe To countrepeise ese and travaile, As we had wonne hit with labour; For that is dere boght honour At regard of our grete ese. And yit thou most us more plese; Let us be holden eek, therto, Worthy, wyse, and gode also, And riche, and happy unto love. For goddes love, that sit above, Though we may not the body have Of wimmen, yet, so god yow save! Let men glewe on us the name; Suffyceth that we han the fame.’ ‘I graunte,’ quod she, ‘by my trouthe! Now, Eolus, with-outen slouthe, Tak out thy trumpe of gold, let see, And blow as they han axed me, That every man wene hem at ese, Though they gon in ful badde lese.’ This Eolus gan hit so blowe, That through the world hit was y-knowe. Tho com the seventh route anoon, And fel on kneës everichoon, And seyde, ‘Lady, graunte us sone The same thing, the same bone, That [ye] this nexte folk han doon.’ ‘Fy on yow,’ quod she, ‘everichoon! Ye masty swyn, ye ydel wrecches, Ful of roten slowe tecches! What? false theves! wher ye wolde Be famous good, and no-thing nolde Deserve why, ne never roughte? Men rather yow to-hangen oughte! For ye be lyk the sweynte cat, That wolde have fish; but wostow what? He wolde no-thing wete his clowes. Yvel thrift come on your Iowes, And eek on myn, if I hit graunte, Or do yow favour, yow to avaunte! Thou Eolus, thou king of Trace! Go, blow this folk a sory grace,’ Quod she, ‘anoon; and wostow how? As I shal telle thee right now; Sey: “These ben they that wolde honour Have, and do noskinnes labour, Ne do no good, and yit han laude; And that men wende that bele Isaude Ne coude hem noght of love werne; And yit she that grint at a querne Is al to good to ese hir herte.”’ This Eolus anon up sterte, And with his blakke clarioun He gan to blasen out a soun, As loude as belweth wind in helle. And eek therwith, [the] sooth to telle, This soun was [al] so ful of Iapes, As ever mowes were in apes. And that wente al the world aboute, That every wight gan on hem shoute, And for to laughe as they were wode; Such game fonde they in hir hode. Tho com another companye, That had y-doon the traiterye, The harm, the gretest wikkednesse That any herte couthe gesse; And preyed hir to han good fame, And that she nolde hem doon no shame, But yeve hem loos and good renoun, And do hit blowe in clarioun. ‘Nay, wis!’ quod she, ‘hit were a vyce; Al be ther in me no Iustyce, Me listeth not to do hit now, Ne this nil I not graunte you.’ Tho come ther lepinge in a route, And gonne choppen al aboute Every man upon the croune, That al the halle gan to soune, And seyden: ‘Lady, lefe and dere, We ben swich folk as ye mowe here. To tellen al the tale aright, We ben shrewes, every wight, And han delyt in wikkednes, As gode folk han in goodnes; And Ioye to be knowen shrewes, And fulle of vyce and wikked thewes; Wherfor we preyen yow, a-rowe, That our fame swich be knowe In alle thing right as hit is.’ ‘I graunte hit yow,’ quod she, ‘y-wis. But what art thou that seyst this tale, That werest on thy hose a pale, And on thy tipet swiche a belle!’ ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘sooth to telle, I am that ilke shrewe, y-wis, That brende the temple of Isidis In Athenes, lo, that citee.’ ‘And wherfor didest thou so?’ quod she. ‘By my thrift,’ quod he, ‘madame, I wolde fayn han had a fame, As other folk hadde in the toun, Al-thogh they were of greet renoun For hir vertu and for hir thewes; Thoughte I, as greet a fame han shrewes, Thogh hit be [but] for shrewednesse, As gode folk han for goodnesse; And sith I may not have that oon, That other nil I noght for-goon. And for to gette of Fames hyre, The temple sette I al a-fyre. Now do our loos be blowen swythe, As wisly be thou ever blythe.’ ‘Gladly,’ quod she; ‘thou Eolus, Herestow not what they preyen us?’ ‘Madame, yis, ful wel,’ quod he, ‘And I wil trumpen hit, parde!’ And tok his blakke trumpe faste, And gan to puffen and to blaste, Til hit was at the worldes ende. With that I gan aboute wende; For oon that stood right at my bak, Me thoughte, goodly to me spak, And seyde: ‘Frend, what is thy name? Artow come hider to han fame?’ ‘Nay, for-sothe, frend!’ quod I; ‘I cam noght hider, graunt mercy! For no swich cause, by my heed! Suffyceth me, as I were deed, That no wight have my name in honde. I woot my-self best how I stonde; For what I drye or what I thinke, I wol my-selven al hit drinke, Certeyn, for the more part, As ferforth as I can myn art.’ ‘But what dost thou here than?’ quod he. Quod I, ‘that wol I tellen thee, The cause why I stondë here:— Som newe tydings for to lere:— Som newe thinges, I not what, Tydinges, other this or that, Of love, or swiche thinges glade. For certeynly, he that me made To comen hider, seyde me, I shulde bothe here and see, In this place, wonder thinges; But these be no swiche tydinges As I mene of.’ ‘No?’ quod he. And I answerde, ‘No, pardee! For wel I wiste, ever yit, Sith that first I hadde wit, That som folk han desyred fame Dyversly, and loos, and name; But certeynly, I niste how Ne wher that Fame dwelte, er now; Ne eek of hir descripcioun, Ne also hir condicioun, Ne the ordre of hir dome, Unto the tyme I hider come.’ ‘[Whiche] be, lo, these tydinges, That thou now [thus] hider bringes, That thou hast herd?’ quod he to me; ‘But now, no fors; for wel I see What thou desyrest for to here. Com forth, and stond no longer here, And I wol thee, with-outen drede, In swich another place lede, Ther thou shalt here many oon.’ Tho gan I forth with him to goon Out of the castel, soth to seye. Tho saugh I stonde in a valeye, Under the castel, faste by, An hous, that domus Dedali, That Laborintus cleped is, Nas maad so wonderliche, y-wis, Ne half so queynteliche y-wrought. And evermo, so swift as thought, This queynte hous aboute wente, That never-mo hit stille stente. And ther-out com so greet a noise, That, had hit stonden upon Oise, Men mighte hit han herd esely To Rome, I trowe sikerly. And the noyse which that I herde, For al the world right so hit ferde, As doth the routing of the stoon That from thengyn is leten goon. And al this hous, of whiche I rede, Was made of twigges, falwe, rede, And grene eek, and som weren whyte, Swiche as men to these cages thwyte, Or maken of these paniers, Or elles hottes or dossers; That, for the swough and for the twigges, This hous was also ful of gigges, And also ful eek of chirkinges, And of many other werkinges; And eek this hous hath of entrees As fele as leves been on trees In somer, whan they grene been; And on the roof men may yit seen A thousand holes, and wel mo, To leten wel the soun out go. And by day, in every tyde, Ben al the dores open wyde, And by night, echoon, unshette; Ne porter ther is non to lette No maner tydings in to pace; Ne never reste is in that place, That hit nis fild ful of tydinges, Other loude, or of whispringes; And, over alle the houses angles, Is ful of rouninges and of Iangles Of werre, of pees, of mariages, Of reste, of labour of viages, Of abood, of deeth, of lyfe, Of love, of hate, acorde, of stryfe, Of loos, of lore, and of winninges, Of hele, of sekenesse, of bildinges, Of faire windes, of tempestes, Of qualme of folk, and eek of bestes; Of dyvers transmutaciouns Of estats, and eek of regiouns; Of trust, of drede, of Ielousye, Of wit, of winninge, of folye; Of plentee, and of greet famyne, Of chepe, of derth, and of ruyne; Of good or mis governement, Of fyr, of dyvers accident. And lo, this hous, of whiche I wryte, Siker be ye, hit nas not lyte; For hit was sixty myle of lengthe; Al was the timber of no strengthe, Yet hit is founded to endure Whyl that hit list to Aventure, That is the moder of tydinges, As the see of welles and springes,— And hit was shapen lyk a cage. ‘Certes,’ quod I, ‘in al myn age, Ne saugh I swich a hous as this.’ And as I wondred me, y-wis, Upon this hous, tho war was I How that myn egle, faste by, Was perched hye upon a stoon; And I gan streighte to him goon And seyde thus: ‘I preye thee That thou a whyl abyde me For goddes love, and let me seen What wondres in this place been; For yit, paraventure, I may lere Som good ther-on, or sumwhat here That leef me were, or that I wente.’ ‘Peter! that is myn entente,’ Quod he to me; ‘therfor I dwelle; But certein, oon thing I thee telle, That, but I bringe thee ther-inne, Ne shalt thou never cunne ginne To come in-to hit, out of doute, So faste hit whirleth, lo, aboute. But sith that Ioves, of his grace, As I have seyd, wol thee solace Fynally with [swiche] thinges, Uncouthe sightes and tydinges, To passe with thyn hevinesse; Suche routhe hath he of thy distresse, That thou suffrest debonairly— And wost thy-selven utterly Disesperat of alle blis, Sith that Fortune hath maad a-mis The [fruit] of al thyn hertes reste Languisshe and eek in point to breste— That he, through his mighty meryte, Wol do thee ese, al be hit lyte, And yaf expres commaundement, To whiche I am obedient, To furthre thee with al my might, And wisse and teche thee aright Wher thou maist most tydinges here; Shaltow anoon heer many oon lere.’ With this worde he, right anoon, Hente me up bitwene his toon, And at a windowe in me broghte, That in this hous was, as me thoghte— And ther-withal, me thoghte hit stente, And no-thing hit aboute wente— And me sette in the flore adoun. But which a congregacioun Of folk, as I saugh rome aboute Some within and some withoute, Nas never seen, ne shal ben eft; That, certes, in the world nis left So many formed by Nature, Ne deed so many a creature; That wel unethe, in that place, Hadde I oon foot-brede of space; And every wight that I saugh there Rouned ech in otheres ere A newe tyding prevely, Or elles tolde al openly Right thus, and seyde: ‘Nost not thou That is betid, lo, late or now?’ ‘No,’ quod [the other], ‘tel me what;’— And than he tolde him this and that, And swoor ther-to that hit was sooth— ‘Thus hath he seyd’—and ‘Thus he dooth’— ‘Thus shal hit be’—‘Thus herde I seye’— ‘That shal be found’—‘That dar I leye:’— That al the folk that is a-lyve Ne han the cunning to discryve The thinges that I herde there, What aloude, and what in ere. But al the wonder-most was this:— Whan oon had herd a thing, y-wis, He com forth to another wight, And gan him tellen, anoon-right, The same that to him was told, Or hit a furlong-way was old, But gan somwhat for to eche To this tyding in this speche More than hit ever was. And nat so sone departed nas That he fro him, that he ne mette With the thridde; and, or he lette Any stounde, he tolde him als; Were the tyding sooth or fals, Yit wolde he telle hit nathelees, And evermo with more encrees Than hit was erst. Thus north and southe Went every [word] fro mouth to mouthe, And that encresing ever-mo, As fyr is wont to quikke and go From a sparke spronge amis, Til al a citee brent up is. And, whan that was ful y-spronge, And woxen more on every tonge Than ever hit was, [hit] wente anoon Up to a windowe, out to goon; Or, but hit mighte out ther pace, Hit gan out crepe at som crevace, And fleigh forth faste for the nones. And somtyme saugh I tho, at ones, A lesing and a sad soth-sawe, That gonne of aventure drawe Out at a windowe for to pace; And, when they metten in that place, They were a-chekked bothe two, And neither of hem moste out go; For other so they gonne croude, Til eche of hem gan cryen loude, ‘Lat me go first!’ ‘Nay, but lat me! And here I wol ensuren thee With the nones that thou wolt do so, That I shal never fro thee go, But be thyn owne sworen brother! We wil medle us ech with other, That no man, be he never so wrothe, Shal han that oon [of] two, but bothe At ones, al beside his leve, Come we a-morwe or on eve, Be we cryed or stille y-rouned.’ Thus saugh I fals and sooth compouned Togeder flee for oo tydinge. Thus out at holes gonne wringe Every tyding streight to Fame; And she gan yeven eche his name, After hir disposicioun, And yaf hem eek duracioun, Some to wexe and wane sone, As dooth the faire whyte mone, And leet hem gon. Ther mighte I seen Wenged wondres faste fleen, Twenty thousand in a route, As Eolus hem blew aboute. And, lord! this hous, in alle tymes, Was ful of shipmen and pilgrymes, With scrippes bret-ful of lesinges, Entremedled with tydinges, And eek alone by hem-selve. O, many a thousand tymes twelve Saugh I eek of these pardoneres, Currours, and eek messangeres, With boistes crammed ful of lyes As ever vessel was with lyes. And as I alther-fastest wente Aboute, and dide al myn entente Me for to pleye and for to lere, And eek a tyding for to here, That I had herd of som contree That shal not now be told for me;— For hit no nede is, redely; Folk can singe hit bet than I; For al mot out, other late or rathe, Alle the sheves in the lathe;— I herde a gret noise withalle In a corner of the halle, Ther men of love tydings tolde, And I gan thiderward beholde; For I saugh renninge every wight, As faste as that they hadden might; And everich cryed, ‘What thing is that?’ And som seyde, ‘I not never what.’ And whan they were alle on an hepe, Tho behinde gonne up lepe, And clamben up on othere faste, And up the nose on hye caste, And troden faste on othere heles And stampe, as men don after eles. Atte laste I saugh a man, Which that I [nevene] naught ne can; But he semed for to be A man of greet auctoritee . . . . (Unfinished.) THE LEGEND OF GOOD WOMEN. Only ‘Text B.’ (the later version) is included, comprising mainly of the Fairfax ms. supplemented by other mss. where spellings are inferior. The prologe of .ix. goode Wimmen. A thousand tymes have I herd men telle, That ther is Ioye in heven, and peyne in helle; And I acorde wel that hit is so; But natheles, yit wot I wel also, That ther nis noon dwelling in this contree, That either hath in heven or helle y-be, Ne may of hit non other weyes witen, But as he hath herd seyd, or founde hit writen; For by assay ther may no man hit preve. But god forbede but men shulde leve Wel more thing then men han seen with yë! Men shal nat wenen every-thing a lyë But-if him-self hit seeth, or elles dooth; For, god wot, thing is never the lasse sooth, Thogh every wight ne may hit nat y-see. Bernard the monk ne saugh nat al, parde! Than mote we to bokes that we finde, Through which that olde thinges been in minde, And to the doctrine of these olde wyse, Yeve credence, in every skilful wyse, That tellen of these olde appreved stories, Of holinesse, of regnes, of victories, Of love, of hate, of other sundry thinges, Of whiche I may not maken rehersinges. And if that olde bokes were a-weye, Y-loren were of remembraunce the keye. Wel oghte us than honouren and beleve These bokes, ther we han non other preve. And as for me, thogh that I can but lyte, On bokes for to rede I me delyte, And to hem yeve I feyth and ful credence, And in myn herte have hem in reverence So hertely, that ther is game noon That fro my bokes maketh me to goon, But hit be seldom, on the holyday; Save, certeynly, whan that the month of May Is comen, and that I here the foules singe, And that the floures ginnen for to springe, Farwel my book and my devocioun! Now have I than swich a condicioun, That, of alle the floures in the mede, Than love I most these floures whyte and rede, Swiche as men callen daysies in our toun. To hem have I so greet affeccioun, As I seyde erst, whan comen is the May, That in my bed ther daweth me no day That I nam up, and walking in the mede To seen this flour agein the sonne sprede, Whan hit upryseth erly by the morwe; That blisful sighte softneth al my sorwe, So glad am I whan that I have presence Of hit, to doon al maner reverence, As she, that is of alle floures flour, Fulfilled of al vertu and honour, And ever y-lyke fair, and fresh of hewe; And I love hit, and ever y-lyke newe, And ever shal, til that myn herte dye; Al swere I nat, of this I wol nat lye, Ther loved no wight hotter in his lyve. And whan that hit is eve, I renne blyve, As sone as ever the sonne ginneth weste, To seen this flour, how it wol go to reste, For fere of night, so hateth she derknesse! Hir chere is pleynly sprad in the brightnesse Of the sonne, for ther hit wol unclose. Allas! that I ne had English, ryme or prose, Suffisant this flour to preyse aright! But helpeth, ye that han conning and might, Ye lovers, that can make of sentement; In this cas oghte ye be diligent To forthren me somwhat in my labour, Whether ye ben with the leef or with the flour. For wel I wot, that ye han her-biforn Of making ropen, and lad awey the corn; And I come after, glening here and there, And am ful glad if I may finde an ere Of any goodly word that ye han left. And thogh it happen me rehercen eft That ye han in your fresshe songes sayd, For-bereth me, and beth nat evel apayd, Sin that ye see I do hit in the honour Of love, and eek in service of the flour, Whom that I serve as I have wit or might. She is the clernesse and the verray light, That in this derke worlde me wynt and ledeth, The herte in-with my sorowful brest yow dredeth, And loveth so sore, that ye ben verrayly The maistresse of my wit, and nothing I. My word, my werk, is knit so in your bonde, That, as an harpe obeyeth to the honde And maketh hit soune after his fingeringe, Right so mowe ye out of myn herte bringe Swich vois, right as yow list, to laughe or pleyne. Be ye my gyde and lady sovereyne; As to myn erthly god, to yow I calle, Bothe in this werke and in my sorwes alle. But wherfor that I spak, to give credence To olde stories, and doon hem reverence, And that men mosten more thing beleve Then men may seen at eye or elles preve? That shal I seyn, whan that I see my tyme; I may not al at ones speke in ryme. My besy gost, that thrusteth alwey newe To seen this flour so yong, so fresh of hewe, Constreyned me with so gledy desyr, That in my herte I fele yit the fyr, That made me to ryse er hit wer day— And this was now the firste morwe of May— With dredful herte and glad devocioun, For to ben at the resureccioun Of this flour, whan that it shuld unclose Agayn the sonne, that roos as rede as rose, That in the brest was of the beste that day, That Agenores doghter ladde away. And doun on knees anon-right I me sette, And, as I coude, this fresshe flour I grette; Kneling alwey, til hit unclosed was, Upon the smale softe swote gras, That was with floures swote enbrouded al, Of swich swetnesse and swich odour over-al, That, for to speke of gomme, or herbe, or tree, Comparisoun may noon y-maked be; For hit surmounteth pleynly alle odoures, And eek of riche beautee alle floures. Forgeten had the erthe his pore estat Of winter, that him naked made and mat, And with his swerd of cold so sore greved; Now hath the atempre sonne al that releved That naked was, and clad hit new agayn. The smale foules, of the seson fayn, That from the panter and the net ben scaped, Upon the fouler, that hem made a-whaped In winter, and distroyed had hir brood, In his despyt, hem thoughte hit did hem good To singe of him, and in hir song despyse The foule cherl that, for his covetyse, Had hem betrayed with his sophistrye. This was hir song—‘the fouler we defye, And al his craft!’ And somme songen clere Layes of love, that Ioye hit was to here, In worshipinge and preisinge of hir make. And, for the newe blisful somers sake, Upon the braunches ful of blosmes softe, In hir delyt, they turned hem ful ofte, And songen, ‘blessed be seynt Valentyn! For on his day I chees yow to be myn, Withouten repenting, myn herte swete!’ And therwith-al hir bekes gonnen mete, Yelding honour and humble obeisaunces To love, and diden hir other observaunces That longeth unto love and to nature; Construeth that as yow list, I do no cure. And tho that hadde doon unkindenesse— As dooth the tydif, for new-fangelnesse— Besoghte mercy of hir trespassinge, And humblely songen hir repentinge, And sworen on the blosmes to be trewe, So that hir makes wolde upon hem rewe, And at the laste maden hir acord. Al founde they Daunger for a tyme a lord, Yet Pitee, through his stronge gentil might, Forgaf, and made Mercy passen Right, Through innocence and ruled curtesye. But I ne clepe nat innocence folye, Ne fals pitee, for ‘vertu is the mene,’ As Etik saith, in swich maner I mene. And thus thise foules, voide of al malyce, Acordeden to love, and laften vyce Of hate, and songen alle of oon acord, ‘Welcome, somer, our governour and lord!’ And Zephirus and Flora gentilly Yaf to the floures, softe and tenderly, Hir swote breth, and made hem for to sprede, As god and goddesse of the floury mede; In which me thoghte I mighte, day by day, Dwellen alwey, the Ioly month of May, Withouten sleep, withouten mete or drinke. A-doun ful softely I gan to sinke; And, leninge on myn elbowe and my syde, The longe day I shoop me for to abyde For nothing elles, and I shal nat lye, But for to loke upon the dayesye, That wel by reson men hit calle may The ‘dayesye’ or elles the ‘ye of day,’ The emperice and flour of floures alle. I pray to god that faire mot she falle, And alle that loven floures, for hir sake! But natheles, ne wene nat that I make In preysing of the flour agayn the leef, No more than of the corn agayn the sheef: For, as to me, nis lever noon ne lother; I nam with-holden yit with never nother. Ne I not who serveth leef, ne who the flour; Wel brouken they hir service or labour; For this thing is al of another tonne, Of olde story, er swich thing was be-gonne. Whan that the sonne out of the south gan weste, And that this flour gan close and goon to reste For derknesse of the night, the which she dredde, Hoom to myn hous ful swiftly I me spedde To goon to reste, and erly for to ryse, To seen this flour to sprede, as I devyse. And, in a litel herber that I have, That benched was on turves fresshe y-grave, I bad men sholde me my couche make; For deyntee of the newe someres sake, I bad hem strawen floures on my bed. Whan I was leyd, and had myn eyen hed, I fel on slepe in-with an houre or two; Me mette how I lay in the medew tho, To seen this flour that I so love and drede. And from a-fer com walking in the mede The god of love, and in his hande a quene; And she was clad in real habit grene. A fret of gold she hadde next hir heer, And upon that a whyt coroun she beer With florouns smale, and I shal nat lye; For al the world, ryght as a dayesye Y-corouned is with whyte leves lyte, So were the florouns of hir coroun whyte; For of o perle fyne, oriental, Hir whyte coroun was y-maked al; For which the whyte coroun, above the grene, Made hir lyk a daysie for to sene, Considered eek hir fret of gold above. Y-clothed was this mighty god of love In silke, enbrouded ful of grene greves, In-with a fret of rede rose-leves, The fresshest sin the world was first bigonne. His gilte heer was corouned with a sonne, In-stede of gold, for hevinesse and wighte; Therwith me thoughte his face shoon so brighte That wel unnethes mighte I him beholde; And in his hande me thoughte I saugh him holde Two fyry dartes, as the gledes rede; And aungellyke his winges saugh I sprede. And al be that men seyn that blind is he, Al-gate me thoughte that he mighte see; For sternely on me he gan biholde, So that his loking doth myn herte colde. And by the hande he held this noble quene, Corouned with whyte, and clothed al in grene, So womanly, so benigne, and so meke, That in this world, thogh that men wolde seke, Half hir beautee shulde men nat finde In creature that formed is by kinde. And therfor may I seyn, as thinketh me, This song, in preysing of this lady fre. Balade. Hyd, Absolon, thy gilte tresses clere; Ester, ley thou thy meknesse al a-doun; Hyd, Ionathas, al thy frendly manere; Penalopee, and Marcia Catoun, Mak of your wyfhod no comparisoun; Hyde ye your beautes, Isoude and Eleyne, My lady cometh, that al this may disteyne. Thy faire body, lat hit nat appere, Lavyne; and thou, Lucresse of Rome toun, And Polixene, that boghten love so dere, And Cleopatre, with al thy passioun, Hyde ye your trouthe of love and your renoun; And thou, Tisbe, that hast of love swich peyne; My lady cometh, that al this may disteyne. Herro, Dido, Laudomia, alle y-fere, And Phyllis, hanging for thy Demophoun, And Canace, espyed by thy chere, Ysiphile, betraysed with Jasoun, Maketh of your trouthe neyther boost ne soun; Nor Ypermistre or Adriane, ye tweyne; My lady cometh, that al this may disteyne. This balade may ful wel y-songen be, As I have seyd erst, by my lady free; For certeynly, alle these mow nat suffyse To apperen with my lady in no wyse. For as the sonne wol the fyr disteyne, So passeth al my lady sovereyne, That is so good, so fair, so debonaire; I prey to god that ever falle hir faire! For, nadde comfort been of hir presence, I had ben deed, withouten any defence, For drede of Loves wordes and his chere; As, when tyme is, her-after ye shal here. Behind this god of love, upon the grene, I saugh cominge of ladyës nyntene In real habit, a ful esy paas; And after hem com of women swich a traas, That, sin that god Adam had mad of erthe, The thridde part of mankynd, or the ferthe, Ne wende I nat by possibilitee, Had ever in this wyde worlde y-be; And trewe of love thise women were echoon. Now whether was that a wonder thing or noon, That, right anoon as that they gonne espye This flour, which that I clepe the dayesye, Ful sodeinly they stinten alle at ones, And kneled doun, as it were for the nones, And songen with o vois, ‘Hele and honour To trouthe of womanhede, and to this flour That berth our alder prys in figuringe! Hir whyte coroun berth the witnessinge!’ And with that word, a-compas enviroun, They setten hem ful softely adoun. First sat the god of love, and sith his quene With the whyte coroun, clad in grene; And sithen al the remenant by and by, As they were of estaat, ful curteisly; Ne nat a word was spoken in the place The mountance of a furlong-wey of space. I kneling by this flour, in good entente Abood, to knowen what this peple mente, As stille as any stoon; til at the laste, This god of love on me his eyen caste, And seyde, ‘who kneleth ther’? and I answerde Unto his asking, whan that I hit herde, And seyde, ‘sir, hit am I’; and com him neer, And salued him. Quod he, ‘what dostow heer So nigh myn owne flour, so boldely? For it were better worthy, trewely, A worm to neghen neer my flour than thou.’ ‘And why, sir,’ quod I, ‘and hit lyke yow?’ ‘For thou,’ quod he, ‘art ther-to nothing able. Hit is my relik, digne and delytable, And thou my fo, and al my folk werreyest, And of myn olde servaunts thou misseyest, And hindrest hem, with thy translacioun, And lettest folk from hir devocioun To serve me, and holdest hit folye To serve Love. Thou mayst hit nat denye; For in pleyn text, with-outen nede of glose, Thou hast translated the Romaunce of the Rose, That is an heresye ageyns my lawe, And makest wyse folk fro me withdrawe. And of Criseyde thou hast seyd as thee liste, That maketh men to wommen lasse triste, That ben as trewe as ever was any steel. Of thyn answere avyse thee right weel; For, thogh that thou reneyed hast my lay, As other wrecches han doon many a day, By seynt Venus, that my moder is, If that thou live, thou shalt repenten this So cruelly, that hit shal wel be sene!’ Tho spak this lady, clothed al in grene, And seyde, ‘god, right of your curtesye, Ye moten herknen if he can replye Agayns al this that ye han to him meved; A god ne sholde nat be thus agreved, But of his deitee he shal be stable, And therto gracious and merciable. And if ye nere a god, that knowen al, Than mighte hit be, as I yow tellen shal; This man to you may falsly been accused, Ther as by right him oghte been excused. For in your court is many a losengeour, And many a queynte totelere accusour, That tabouren in your eres many a soun, Right after hir imaginacioun, To have your daliance, and for envye; These been the causes, and I shall nat lye. Envye is lavender of the court alway; For she ne parteth, neither night ne day, Out of the hous of Cesar; thus seith Dante; Who-so that goth, algate she wol nat wante. And eek, paraunter, for this man is nyce, He mighte doon hit, gessing no malyce, But for he useth thinges for to make; Him rekketh noght of what matere he take; Or him was boden maken thilke tweye Of som persone, and durste hit nat with-seye; Or him repenteth utterly of this. He ne hath nat doon so grevously amis To translaten that olde clerkes wryten, As thogh that he of malice wolde endyten Despyt of love, and had him-self hit wroght. This shulde a rightwys lord have in his thoght, And nat be lyk tiraunts of Lumbardye, Than han no reward but at tirannye. For he that king or lord is naturel, Him oghte nat be tiraunt ne cruel, As is a fermour, to doon the harm he can. He moste thinke hit is his lige man, And is his tresour, and his gold in cofre. This is the sentence of the philosophre: A king to kepe his liges in Iustyce; With-outen doute, that is his offyce. Al wol he kepe his lordes hir degree, As hit is right and skilful that they be Enhaunced and honoured, and most dere— For they ben half-goddes in this world here— Yit mot he doon bothe right, to pore and riche, Al be that hir estat be nat y-liche, And han of pore folk compassioun. For lo, the gentil kynd of the leoun! For whan a flye offendeth him or byteth, He with his tayl awey the flye smyteth Al esily; for, of his genterye, Him deyneth nat to wreke him on a flye, As doth a curre or elles another beste. In noble corage oghte been areste, And weyen every thing by equitee, And ever han reward to his owen degree. For, sir, hit is no maystrie for a lord To dampne a man with-oute answere of word; And, for a lord, that is ful foul to use. And if so be he may him nat excuse, But asketh mercy with a dredful herte, And profreth him, right in his bare sherte, To been right at your owne Iugement, Than oghte a god, by short avysement, Considre his owne honour and his trespas. For sith no cause of deeth lyth in this cas, Yow oghte been the lighter merciable; Leteth your yre, and beth somwhat tretable! The man hath served yow of his conning, And forthred wel your lawe in his making. ‘Al be hit that he can nat wel endyte, Yet hath he maked lewed folk delyte To serve you, in preysing of your name. He made the book that hight the Hous of Fame, And eek the Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse, And the Parlement of Foules, as I gesse, And al the love of Palamon and Arcyte Of Thebes, thogh the story is knowen lyte; And many an ympne for your halydayes, That highten Balades, Roundels, Virelayes; And, for to speke of other holynesse, He hath in prose translated Boëce, And mad the Lyf also of seynt Cecyle; He made also, goon sithen a greet whyl, Origenes upon the Maudeleyne; Him oghte now to have the lesse peyne; He hath mad many a lay and many a thing. ‘Now as ye been a god, and eek a king, I, your Alceste, whylom quene of Trace, I aske yow this man, right of your grace, That ye him never hurte in al his lyve; And he shal sweren yow, and that as blyve, He shal no more agilten in this wyse; But he shal maken, as ye wil devyse, Of wommen trewe in lovinge al hir lyve, Wher-so ye wil, of maiden or of wyve, And forthren yow, as muche as he misseyde Or in the Rose or elles in Creseyde.’ The god of love answerde hir thus anoon, ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘hit is so long agoon That I yow knew so charitable and trewe, That never yit, sith that the world was newe, To me ne fond I better noon than ye. If that I wolde save my degree, I may ne wol nat werne your requeste; Al lyth in yow, doth with him as yow leste. I al foryeve, with-outen lenger space; For who-so yeveth a yift, or doth a grace, Do hit by tyme, his thank is wel the more; And demeth ye what he shal do therfore. Go thanke now my lady heer,’ quod he. I roos, and doun I sette me on my knee, And seyde thus: ‘Madame, the god above Foryelde yow, that ye the god of love Han maked me his wrathe to foryive; And yeve me grace so long for to live, That I may knowe soothly what ye be That han me holpe and put in this degree. But trewely I wende, as in this cas, Naught have agilt, ne doon to love trespas. Forwhy a trewe man, with-outen drede, Hath nat to parten with a theves dede; Ne a trewe lover oghte me nat blame, Thogh that I speke a fals lover som shame. They oghte rather with me for to holde, For that I of Creseyde wroot or tolde, Or of the Rose; what-so myn auctour mente, Algate, god wot, hit was myn entente To forthren trouthe in love and hit cheryce; And to be war fro falsnesse and fro vyce By swich ensample; this was my meninge.’ And she answerde, ‘lat be thyn arguinge; For Love ne wol nat countrepleted be In right ne wrong; and lerne that of me! Thou hast thy grace, and hold thee right ther-to. Now wol I seyn what penance thou shalt do For thy trespas, and understond hit here: Thou shalt, whyl that thou livest, yeer by yere, The moste party of thy tyme spende In making of a glorious Legende Of Gode Wommen, maidenes and wyves, That weren trewe in lovinge al hir lyves; And telle of false men that hem bitrayen, That al hir lyf ne doon nat but assayen How many wommen they may doon a shame; For in your world that is now holde a game. And thogh thee lyke nat a lover be, Spek wel of love; this penance yive I thee. And to the god of love I shal so preye, That he shal charge his servants, by any weye, To forthren thee, and wel thy labour quyte; Go now thy wey, this penance is but lyte. And whan this book is maad, yive hit the quene On my behalfe, at Eltham, or at Shene.’ The god of love gan smyle, and than he seyde, ‘Wostow,’ quod he, ‘wher this be wyf or mayde, Or quene, or countesse, or of what degree, That hath so litel penance yiven thee, That hast deserved sorer for to smerte? But pitee renneth sone in gentil herte; That maystow seen, she kytheth what she is.’ And I answerde, ‘nay, sir, so have I blis, No more but that I see wel she is good.’ ‘That is a trewe tale, by myn hood,’ Quod Love, ‘and that thou knowest wel, pardee, If hit be so that thou avyse thee. Hastow nat in a book, lyth in thy cheste, The grete goodnesse of the quene Alceste, That turned was into a dayesye: She that for hir husbonde chees to dye, And eek to goon to helle, rather than he, And Ercules rescowed hir, pardee, And broghte hir out of helle agayn to blis?’ And I answerde ageyn, and seyde, ‘yis, Now knowe I hir! And is this good Alceste, The dayesye, and myn owne hertes reste? Now fele I wel the goodnesse of this wyf, That bothe after hir deeth, and in hir lyf, Hir grete bountee doubleth hir renoun! Wel hath she quit me myn affeccioun That I have to hir flour, the dayesye! No wonder is thogh Iove hir stellifye, As telleth Agaton, for hir goodnesse! Hir whyte coroun berth of hit witnesse; For also many vertues hadde she, As smale floures in hir coroun be. In remembraunce of hir and in honour, Cibella made the dayesy and the flour Y-coroned al with whyt, as men may see; And Mars yaf to hir coroun reed, pardee, In stede of rubies, set among the whyte.’ Therwith this quene wex reed for shame a lyte, Whan she was preysed so in hir presence. Than seyde Love, ‘a ful gret negligence Was hit to thee, that ilke tyme thou made “Hyd, Absolon, thy tresses,” in balade, That thou forgete hir in thy song to sette, Sin that thou art so gretly in hir dette, And wost so wel, that kalender is she To any woman that wol lover be. For she taughte al the craft of fyn lovinge, And namely of wyfhood the livinge, And alle the boundes that she oghte kepe; Thy litel wit was thilke tyme a-slepe. But now I charge thee, upon thy lyf, That in thy Legend thou make of this wyf, Whan thou hast other smale y-maad before; And fare now wel, I charge thee no more. ‘But er I go, thus muche I wol thee telle, Ne shal no trewe lover come in helle. Thise other ladies sittinge here arowe Ben in thy balade, if thou canst hem knowe, And in thy bokes alle thou shalt hem finde; Have hem now in thy Legend alle in minde, I mene of hem that been in thy knowinge. For heer ben twenty thousand mo sittinge Than thou knowest, that been good wommen alle And trewe of love, for aught that may befalle; Make the metres of hem as thee leste. I mot gon hoom, the sonne draweth weste, To Paradys, with al this companye; And serve alwey the fresshe dayesye. ‘At Cleopatre I wol that thou beginne; And so forth; and my love so shalt thou winne. For lat see now what man that lover be, Wol doon so strong a peyne for love as she. I wot wel that thou mayst nat al hit ryme, That swiche lovers diden in hir tyme; It were to long to reden and to here; Suffyceth me, thou make in this manere, That thou reherce of al hir lyf the grete, After thise olde auctours listen to trete. For who-so shal so many a storie telle, Sey shortly, or he shal to longe dwelle.’ And with that word my bokes gan I take, And right thus on my Legend gan I make. I. THE LEGEND OF CLEOPATRA. Incipit Legenda Cleopatrie, Martiris, Egipti regine. After the deeth of Tholomee the king, That al Egipte hadde in his governing, Regned his quene Cleopataras; Til on a tyme befel ther swiche a cas, That out of Rome was sent a senatour, For to conqueren regnes and honour Unto the toun of Rome, as was usaunce, To have the world unto her obeisaunce; And, sooth to seye, Antonius was his name. So fil hit, as Fortune him oghte a shame Whan he was fallen in prosperitee, Rebel unto the toun of Rome is he. And over al this, the suster of Cesar, He lafte hir falsly, er that she was war, And wolde algates han another wyf; For whiche he took with Rome and Cesar stryf. Natheles, for-sooth, this ilke senatour Was a ful worthy gentil werreyour, And of his deeth hit was ful greet damage. But love had broght this man in swiche a rage, And him so narwe bounden in his las, Al for the love of Cleopataras, That al the world he sette at no value. Him thoughte, nas to him no thing so due As Cleopatras for to love and serve; Him roghte nat in armes for to sterve In the defence of hir, and of hir right. This noble quene eek lovede so this knight, Through his desert, and for his chivalrye; As certeinly, but-if that bokes lye, He was, of persone and of gentilesse, And of discrecioun and hardinesse, Worthy to any wight that liven may. And she was fair as is the rose in May. And, for to maken shortly is the beste, She wex his wyf, and hadde him as hir leste. The wedding and the feste to devyse, To me, that have y-take swiche empryse Of so many a storie for to make, Hit were to long, lest that I sholde slake Of thing that bereth more effect and charge; For men may overlade a ship or barge; And forthy to theffect than wol I skippe, And al the remenant, I wol lete hit slippe. Octovian, that wood was of this dede, Shoop him an ost on Antony to lede Al-outerly for his destruccioun, With stoute Romains, cruel as leoun; To ship they wente, and thus I let hem saile. Antonius was war, and wol nat faile To meten with thise Romains, if he may; Took eek his reed, and bothe, upon a day, His wyf and he, and al his ost, forth wente To shippe anoon, no lenger they ne stente; And in the see hit happed hem to mete— Up goth the trompe—and for to shoute and shete, And peynen hem to sette on with the sonne. With grisly soun out goth the grete gonne, And heterly they hurtlen al at ones, And fro the top doun cometh the grete stones. In goth the grapenel so ful of crokes Among the ropes, and the shering-hokes. In with the polax presseth he and he; Behind the mast beginneth he to flee, And out agayn, and dryveth him over-borde; He stingeth him upon his speres orde; He rent the sail with hokes lyke a sythe; He bringeth the cuppe, and biddeth hem be blythe; He poureth pesen upon the hacches slider; With pottes ful of lym they goon to-gider; And thus the longe day in fight they spende Til, at the laste, as every thing hath ende, Antony is shent, and put him to the flighte, And al his folk to-go, that best go mighte. Fleeth eek the queen, with al her purpre sail, For strokes, which that wente as thikke as hail; No wonder was, she mighte hit nat endure. And whan that Antony saw that aventure, ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘the day that I was born! My worshipe in this day thus have I lorn!’ And for dispeyr out of his witte he sterte, And roof him-self anoon through-out the herte Er that he ferther wente out of the place. His wyf, that coude of Cesar have no grace, To Egipte is fled, for drede and for distresse; But herkneth, ye that speke of kindenesse. Ye men, that falsly sweren many an ooth That ye wol dye, if that your love be wrooth, Heer may ye seen of women whiche a trouthe! This woful Cleopatre hath mad swich routhe That ther nis tonge noon that may hit telle. But on the morwe she wol no lenger dwelle, But made hir subtil werkmen make a shryne Of alle the rubies and the stones fyne In al Egipte that she coude espye; And putte ful the shryne of spycerye, And leet the cors embaume; and forth she fette This dede cors, and in the shryne hit shette. And next the shryne a pit than doth she grave; And alle the serpents that she mighte have, She putte hem in that grave, and thus she seyde: ‘Now love, to whom my sorweful herte obeyde So ferforthly that, fro that blisful houre That I yow swor to been al frely youre, I mene yow, Antonius my knight! That never waking, in the day or night, Ye nere out of myn hertes remembraunce For wele or wo, for carole or for daunce; And in my-self this covenant made I tho, That, right swich as ye felten, wele or wo, As ferforth as hit in my power lay, Unreprovable unto my wyfhood ay, The same wolde I felen, lyf or deeth. And thilke covenant, whyl me lasteth breeth, I wol fulfille, and that shal wel be sene; Was never unto hir love a trewer quene.’ And with that word, naked, with ful good herte, Among the serpents in the pit she sterte, And ther she chees to han hir buryinge. Anoon the neddres gonne hir for to stinge, And she hir deeth receyveth, with good chere, For love of Antony, that was hir so dere:— And this is storial sooth, hit is no fable. Now, er I finde a man thus trewe and stable, And wol for love his deeth so freely take, I pray god lat our hedes never ake! Explicit Legenda Cleopatrie, martiris. II. THE LEGEND OF THISBE OF BABYLON. Incipit Legenda Tesbe Babilonie, Martiris. At Babiloine whylom fil it thus, The whiche toun the queen Semiramus Leet dichen al about, and walles make Ful hye, of harde tyles wel y-bake. Ther weren dwellinge in this noble toun Two lordes, which that were of greet renoun, And woneden so nigh, upon a grene, That ther nas but a stoon-wal hem bitwene, As ofte in grete tounes is the wone. And sooth to seyn, that o man hadde a sone, Of al that londe oon of the lustieste. That other hadde a doghter, the faireste, That estward in the world was tho dwellinge. The name of everich gan to other springe By wommen, that were neighebores aboute. For in that contree yit, withouten doute, Maidens been y-kept, for Ielosye, Ful streite, lest they diden som folye. This yonge man was cleped Piramus, And Tisbe hight the maid, Naso seith thus; And thus by report was hir name y-shove That, as they wexe in age, wex hir love; And certein, as by reson of hir age, Ther mighte have been bitwix hem mariage, But that hir fadres nolde hit nat assente; And bothe in love y-lyke sore they brente, That noon of alle hir frendes mighte hit lette But prively somtyme yit they mette By sleighte, and speken som of hir desyr; As, wry the gleed, and hotter is the fyr; Forbede a love, and it is ten so wood. This wal, which that bitwix hem bothe stood, Was cloven a-two, right fro the toppe adoun, Of olde tyme of his fundacioun; But yit this clifte was so narwe and lyte, It as nat sene, dere y-nogh a myte. But what is that, that love can nat espye? Ye lovers two, if that I shal nat lye, Ye founden first this litel narwe clifte; And, with a soun as softe as any shrifte, They lete hir wordes through the clifte pace, And tolden, whyl that they stode in the place, Al hir compleynt of love, and al hir wo, At every tyme whan they dorste so. Upon that o syde of the wal stood he, And on that other syde stood Tisbe, The swote soun of other to receyve, And thus hir wardeins wolde they deceyve. And every day this wal they wolde threte, And wisshe to god, that it were doun y-bete. Thus wolde they seyn—‘allas! thou wikked wal, Through thyn envye thou us lettest al! Why nilt thou cleve, or fallen al a-two? Or, at the leste, but thou woldest so, Yit woldestow but ones lete us mete, Or ones that we mighte kissen swete, Than were we covered of our cares colde. But natheles, yit be we to thee holde In as muche as thou suffrest for to goon Our wordes through thy lyme and eek thy stoon. Yit oghte we with thee ben wel apayd.’ And whan thise ydel wordes weren sayd, The colde wal they wolden kisse of stoon, And take hir leve, and forth they wolden goon. And this was gladly in the even-tyde Or wonder erly, lest men hit espyde; And longe tyme they wroghte in this manere Til on a day, whan Phebus gan to clere, Aurora with the stremes of hir hete Had dryed up the dew of herbes wete; Unto this clifte, as it was wont to be, Com Pyramus, and after com Tisbe, And plighten trouthe fully in hir fey That ilke same night to stele awey, And to begyle hir wardeins everichoon, And forth out of the citee for to goon; And, for the feldes been so brode and wyde, For to mete in o place at o tyde, They sette mark hir meting sholde be Ther king Ninus was graven, under a tree; For olde payens that ydoles heried Useden tho in feldes to ben beried; And faste by this grave was a welle. And, shortly of this tale for to telle, This covenant was affermed wonder faste; And longe hem thoughte that the sonne laste, That hit nere goon under the see adoun. This Tisbe hath so greet affeccioun And so greet lyking Piramus to see, That, whan she seigh her tyme mighte be, At night she stal awey ful prively With her face y-wimpled subtilly; For alle her frendes—for to save her trouthe— She hath for-sake; allas! and that is routhe That ever woman wolde be so trewe To trusten man, but she the bet him knewe! And to the tree she goth a ful good pas, For love made her so hardy in this cas; And by the welle adoun she gan her dresse. Allas! than comth a wilde leonesse Out of the wode, withouten more areste, With blody mouthe, of strangling of a beste, To drinken of the welle, ther as she sat; And, whan that Tisbe had espyed that, She rist her up, with a ful drery herte, And in a cave with dredful foot she sterte, For by the mone she seigh hit wel with-alle. And, as she ran, her wimpel leet she falle, And took noon heed, so sore she was a-whaped. And eek so glad of that she was escaped; And thus she sit, and darketh wonder stille. Whan that this leonesse hath dronke her fille, Aboute the welle gan she for to winde, And right anoon the wimpel gan she finde, And with her blody mouth hit al to-rente. Whan this was doon, no lenger she ne stente, But to the wode her wey than hath she nome. And, at the laste, this Piramus is come, But al to longe, allas! at hoom was he. The mone shoon, men mighte wel y-see, And in his weye, as that he com ful faste, His eyen to the grounde adoun he caste, And in the sonde, as he beheld adoun, He seigh the steppes brode of a leoun, And in his herte he sodeinly agroos, And pale he wex, therwith his heer aroos, And neer he com, and fond the wimpel torn. ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘the day that I was born! This o night wol us lovers bothe slee! How sholde I axen mercy of Tisbe Whan I am he that have yow slain, allas! My bidding hath yow slain, as in this cas. Allas! to bidde a woman goon by nighte In place ther as peril fallen mighte, And I so slow! allas, I ne hadde be Here in this place a furlong-wey or ye! Now what leoun that be in this foreste, My body mote he renden, or what beste That wilde is, gnawen mote he now myn herte!’ And with that worde he to the wimpel sterte, And kiste hit ofte, and weep on hit ful sore, And seide, ‘wimpel, allas! ther nis no more But thou shalt fele as wel the blood of me As thou hast felt the bleding of Tisbe!’ And with that worde he smoot him to the herte. The blood out of the wounde as brode sterte As water, whan the conduit broken is. Now Tisbe, which that wiste nat of this, But sitting in her drede, she thoghte thus, ‘If hit so falle that my Piramus Be comen hider, and may me nat y-finde, He may me holden fals and eek unkinde.’ And out she comth, and after him gan espyen Bothe with her herte and with her yën, And thoghte, ‘I wol him tellen of my drede Bothe of the leonesse and al my dede.’ And at the laste her love than hath she founde Beting with his heles on the grounde, Al blody, and therwith-al a-bak she sterte, And lyke the wawes quappe gan her herte, And pale as box she wex, and in a throwe Avysed her, and gan him wel to knowe, That hit was Piramus, her herte dere. Who coude wryte whiche a deedly chere Hath Tisbe now, and how her heer she rente, And how she gan her-selve to turmente, And how she lyth and swowneth on the grounde, And how she weep of teres ful his wounde, How medeleth she his blood with her compleynte, And with his blood her-selven gan she peynte; How clippeth she the dede cors, allas? How doth this woful Tisbe in this cas! How kisseth she his frosty mouth so cold! ‘Who hath doon this, and who hath been so bold To sleen my leef? O spek, my Piramus! I am thy Tisbe, that thee calleth thus!’ And therwith-al she lifteth up his heed. This woful man, that was nat fully deed, Whan that he herde the name of Tisbe cryen, On her he caste his hevy deedly yën And doun again, and yeldeth up the gost. Tisbe rist up, withouten noise or bost, And seigh her wimpel and his empty shethe, And eek his swerd, that him hath doon to dethe; Than spak she thus: ‘My woful hand,’ quod she, ‘Is strong y-nogh in swiche a werk to me; For love shal yive me strengthe and hardinesse To make my wounde large y-nogh, I gesse. I wol thee folwen deed, and I wol be Felawe and cause eek of thy deeth,’ quod she. ‘And thogh that nothing save the deeth only Mighte thee fro me departe trewely, Thou shalt no more departe now fro me Than fro the deeth, for I wol go with thee! ‘And now, ye wrecched Ielous fadres oure, We, that weren whylom children youre, We prayen yow, withouten more envye, That in o grave y-fere we moten lye, Sin love hath brought us to this pitous ende! And rightwis god to every lover sende, That loveth trewely, more prosperitee Than ever hadde Piramus and Tisbe! And lat no gentil woman her assure To putten her in swiche an aventure. But god forbede but a woman can Been as trewe and loving as a man! And, for my part, I shal anoon it kythe!’ And, with that worde, his swerd she took as swythe, That warm was of her loves blood and hoot, And to the herte she her-selven smoot. And thus ar Tisbe and Piramus ago. Of trewe men I finde but fewe mo In alle my bokes, save this Piramus, And therfor have I spoken of him thus. For hit is deyntee to us men to finde A man that can in love be trewe and kinde. Heer may ye seen, what lover so he be, A woman dar and can as wel as he. Explicit legenda Tesbe. III. THE LEGEND OF DIDO, QUEEN OF CARTHAGE. Incipit Legenda Didonis martiris, Cartaginis regine. Glory and honour, Virgil Mantuan, Be to thy name! and I shal, as I can, Folow thy lantern, as thou gost biforn, How Eneas to Dido was forsworn. In thyn Eneïd and Naso wol I take The tenour, and the grete effectes make. Whan Troye broght was to destruccioun By Grekes sleighte, and namely by Sinoun, Feyning the hors y-offred to Minerve, Through which that many a Troyan moste sterve; And Ector had, after his deeth, appered, And fyr so wood, it mighte nat be stered, In al the noble tour of Ilioun, That of the citee was the cheef dungeoun; And al the contree was so lowe y-broght, And Priamus the king fordoon and noght; And Eneas was charged by Venus To fleen awey, he took Ascanius, That was his sone, in his right hand, and fledde; And on his bakke he bar and with him ledde His olde fader, cleped Anchises, And by the weye his wyf Creusa he lees. And mochel sorwe hadde he in his minde Er that he coude his felawshippe finde. But, at the laste, whan he had hem founde, He made him redy in a certein stounde, And to the see ful faste he gan him hye, And saileth forth with al his companye Toward Itaile, as wolde destinee. But of his aventures in the see Nis nat to purpos for to speke of here, For hit acordeth nat to my matere. But, as I seide, of him and of Dido Shal be my tale, til that I have do. So longe he sailed in the salte see Til in Libye unnethe aryved he, With shippes seven and with no more navye; And glad was he to londe for to hye, So was he with the tempest al to-shake. And whan that he the haven had y-take, He had a knight, was called Achates; And him of al his felawshippe he chees To goon with him, the contre for tespye; He took with him no more companye. But forth they goon, and lafte his shippes ryde, His fere and he, with-outen any gyde. So longe he walketh in this wildernesse Til, at the laste, he mette an hunteresse. A bowe in honde and arwes hadde she, Her clothes cutted were unto the knee; But she was yit the fairest creature That ever was y-formed by nature; And Eneas and Achates she grette, And thus she to hem spak, whan she hem mette. ‘Sawe ye,’ quod she, ‘as ye han walked wyde, Any of my sustren walke yow besyde, With any wilde boor or other beste That they han hunted to, in this foreste, Y-tukked up, with arwes in her cas?’ ‘Nay, soothly, lady,’ quod this Eneas; ‘But, by thy beaute, as hit thinketh me, Thou mightest never erthely womman be, But Phebus suster artow, as I gesse. And, if so be that thou be a goddesse, Have mercy on our labour and our wo.’ ‘I nam no goddes, soothly,’ quod she tho; ‘For maidens walken in this contree here, With arwes and with bowe, in this manere. This is the regne of Libie, ther ye been, Of which that Dido lady is and queen’— And shortly tolde him al the occasioun Why Dido com into that regioun, Of which as now me lusteth nat to ryme; Hit nedeth nat; hit nere but los of tyme. For this is al and som, it was Venus, His owne moder, that spak with him thus; And to Cartage she bad he sholde him dighte, And vanished anoon out of his sighte. I coude folwe, word for word, Virgyle, But it wolde lasten al to longe a whyle. This noble queen, that cleped was Dido, That whylom was the wyf of Sitheo, That fairer was then is the brighte sonne, This noble toun of Cartage hath begonne; In which she regneth in so greet honour, That she was holde of alle quenes flour, Of gentilesse, of freedom, of beautee; That wel was him that mighte her ones see; Of kinges and of lordes so desyred, That al the world her beaute hadde y-fyred; She stood so wel in every wightes grace. Whan Eneas was come un-to that place, Unto the maister-temple of al the toun Ther Dido was in her devocioun, Ful prively his wey than hath he nome. Whan he was in the large temple come, I can nat seyn if that hit be possible, But Venus hadde him maked invisible— Thus seith the book, with-outen any lees. And whan this Eneas and Achates Hadden in this temple been over-al, Than founde they, depeynted on a wal, How Troye and al the lond destroyed was. ‘Allas! that I was born,’ quod Eneas, ‘Through-out the world our shame is kid so wyde, Now it is peynted upon every syde! We, that weren in prosperitee, Be now disslaundred, and in swich degre, No lenger for to liven I ne kepe!’ And, with that worde, he brast out for to wepe So tendrely, that routhe hit was to sene. This fresshe lady, of the citee quene, Stood in the temple, in her estat royal, So richely, and eek so fair with-al, So yong, so lusty, with her eyen glade, That, if that god, that heven and erthe made, Wolde han a love, for beaute and goodnesse, And womanhod, and trouthe, and seemlinesse, Whom sholde he loven but this lady swete? There nis no womman to him half so mete. Fortune, that hath the world in governaunce, Hath sodeinly broght in so newe a chaunce, That never was ther yit so fremd a cas. For al the companye of Eneas, Which that he wende han loren in the see, Aryved is, nat fer fro that citee; For which, the grettest of his lordes some By aventure ben to the citee come, Unto that same temple, for to seke The quene, and of her socour her beseke; Swich renoun was ther spronge of her goodnesse. And, whan they hadden told al hir distresse, And al hir tempest and hir harde cas, Unto the quene appered Eneas, And openly beknew that hit was he. Who hadde Ioye than but his meynee, That hadden founde hir lord, hir governour? The quene saw they dide him swich honour, And had herd ofte of Eneas, er tho, And in her herte she hadde routhe and wo That ever swich a noble man as he Shal been disherited in swich degree; And saw the man, that he was lyk a knight, And suffisaunt of persone and of might, And lyk to been a veray gentil man; And wel his wordes he besette can, And had a noble visage for the nones, And formed wel of braunes and of bones. For, after Venus, hadde he swich fairnesse, That no man might be half so fair, I gesse. And wel a lord he semed for to be. And, for he was a straunger, somwhat she Lyked him the bet, as, god do bote, To som folk ofte newe thing is swote. Anoon her herte hath pitee of his wo, And, with that pitee, love com in also; And thus, for pitee and for gentilesse, Refresshed moste he been of his distresse. She seide, certes, that she sory was That he hath had swich peril and swich cas; And, in her frendly speche, in this manere She to him spak, and seide as ye may here. ‘Be ye nat Venus sone and Anchises? In good feith, al the worship and encrees That I may goodly doon yow, ye shul have. Your shippes and your meynee shal I save;’ And many a gentil word she spak him to; And comaunded her messageres go The same day, with-outen any faile, His shippes for to seke, and hem vitaile. She many a beste to the shippes sente, And with the wyn she gan hem to presente; And to her royal paleys she her spedde, And Eneas alwey with her she ledde. What nedeth yow the feste to descryve? He never beter at ese was his lyve. Ful was the feste of deyntees and richesse, Of instruments, of song, and of gladnesse, And many an amorous loking and devys. This Eneas is come to Paradys Out of the swolow of helle, and thus in Ioye Remembreth him of his estat in Troye. To dauncing-chambres ful of parements, Of riche beddes, and of ornaments, This Eneas is lad, after the mete. And with the quene whan that he had sete, And spyces parted, and the wyn agoon, Unto his chambres was he lad anoon To take his ese and for to have his reste, With al his folk, to doon what so hem leste. Ther nas coursere wel y-brydled noon, Ne stede, for the Iusting wel to goon, Ne large palfrey, esy for the nones, Ne Iuwel, fretted ful of riche stones, Ne sakkes ful of gold, of large wighte, Ne ruby noon, that shynede by nighte, Ne gentil hautein faucon heronere, Ne hound, for hert or wilde boor or dere, Ne coupe of gold, with florins newe y-bete, That in the lond of Libie may be gete, That Dido ne hath hit Eneas y-sent; And al is payed, what that he hath spent. Thus can this [noble] quene her gestes calle, As she that can in freedom passen alle. Eneas sothly eek, with-outen lees, Hath sent un-to his shippe, by Achates, After his sone, and after riche thinges, Both ceptre, clothes, broches, and eek ringes, Som for to were, and som for to presente To her, that all thise noble thinges him sente; And bad his sone, how that he sholde make The presenting, and to the quene hit take. Repaired is this Achates again, And Eneas ful blisful is and fain To seen his yonge sone Ascanius. But natheles, our autour telleth us, That Cupido, that is the god of love, At preyere of his moder, hye above, Hadde the lyknes of the child y-take, This noble quene enamoured to make On Eneas; but, as of that scripture, Be as be may, I make of hit no cure. But sooth is this, the quene hath mad swich chere Un-to this child, that wonder is to here; And of the present that his fader sente She thanked him ful ofte, in good entente. Thus is this quene in plesaunce and in Ioye, With al this newe lusty folk of Troye. And of the dedes hath she more enquered Of Eneas, and al the story lered Of Troye; and al the longe day they tweye Entendeden to speken and to pleye; Of which ther gan to breden swich a fyr, That sely Dido hath now swich desyr With Eneas, her newe gest, to dele, That she hath lost her hewe, and eek her hele. Now to theffect, now to the fruit of al, Why I have told this story, and tellen shal. Thus I beginne; hit fil, upon a night, When that the mone up-reysed had her light, This noble quene un-to her reste wente; She syketh sore, and gan her-self turmente. She waketh, walweth, maketh many a brayd, As doon thise loveres, as I have herd sayd. And at the laste, unto her suster Anne She made her moon, and right thus spak she thanne. ‘Now, dere suster myn, what may hit be That me agasteth in my dreme?’ quod she. ‘This ilke Troyan is so in my thoght, For that me thinketh he is so wel y-wroght, And eek so lykly for to be a man, And therwithal so mikel good he can, That al my love and lyf lyth in his cure. Have ye not herd him telle his aventure? Now certes, Anne, if that ye rede hit me, I wolde fain to him y-wedded be; This is theffect; what sholde I more seye? In him lyth al, to do me live or deye.’ Her suster Anne, as she that coude her good, Seide as her thoughte, and somdel hit with-stood. But her-of was so long a sermoning, Hit were to long to make rehersing; But fynally, hit may not been with-stonde; Love wol love—for no wight wol hit wonde. The dawening up-rist out of the see; This amorous quene chargeth her meynee The nettes dresse, and speres brode and kene; An hunting wol this lusty fresshe quene; So priketh her this newe Ioly wo. To hors is al her lusty folk y-go; Un-to the court the houndes been y-broght, And up-on coursers, swift as any thoght, Her yonge knightes hoven al aboute, And of her wommen eek an huge route. Up-on a thikke palfrey, paper-whyt, With sadel rede, enbrouded with delyt, Of gold the barres up-enbossed hye, Sit Dido, al in gold and perre wrye; And she is fair, as is the brighte morwe, That heleth seke folk of nightes sorwe. Up-on a courser, startling as the fyr, Men mighte turne him with a litel wyr, Sit Eneas, lyk Phebus to devyse; So was he fresshe arayed in his wyse. The fomy brydel with the bit of gold Governeth he, right as him-self hath wold. And forth this noble quene thus lat I ryde An hunting, with this Troyan by her syde. The herd of hertes founden is anoon, With ‘hey! go bet! prik thou! lat goon, lat goon! Why nil the leoun comen or the bere, That I mighte ones mete him with this spere?’ Thus seyn thise yonge folk, and up they kille These hertes wilde, and han hem at hir wille. Among al this to-romblen gan the heven, The thunder rored with a grisly steven; Doun com the rain, with hail and sleet so faste, With hevenes fyr, that hit so sore agaste This noble quene, and also her meynee, That ech of hem was glad a-wey to flee. And shortly, fro the tempest her to save, She fledde her-self into a litel cave, And with her wente this Eneas al-so; I noot, with hem if ther wente any mo; The autour maketh of hit no mencioun. And heer began the depe affeccioun Betwix hem two; this was the firste morwe Of her gladnesse, and ginning of her sorwe. For ther hath Eneas y-kneled so, And told her al his herte, and al his wo, And sworn so depe, to her to be trewe, For wele or wo, and chaunge for no newe, And as a fals lover so wel can pleyne, That sely Dido rewed on his peyne, And took him for husband, [to been] his wyf For ever-mo, whyl that hem laste lyf. And after this, whan that the tempest stente, With mirth out as they comen, hoom they wente. The wikked fame up roos, and that anon, How Eneas hath with the quene y-gon In-to the cave; and demed as hem liste; And whan the king, that Yarbas hight, hit wiste, As he that had her loved ever his lyf, And wowed her, to have her to his wyf, Swich sorwe as he hath maked, and swich chere, Hit is a routhe and pitee for to here. But, as in love, al-day hit happeth so, That oon shal laughen at anothers wo; Now laugheth Eneas, and is in Ioye And more richesse than ever he was in Troye. O sely womman, ful of innocence, Ful of pitee, of trouthe, and conscience, What maked yow to men to trusten so? Have ye swich routhe upon hir feined wo, And han swich olde ensamples yow beforn? See ye nat alle, how they been for-sworn? Wher see ye oon, that he ne hath laft his leef, Or been unkinde, or doon her som mischeef, Or pilled her, or bosted of his dede? Ye may as wel hit seen, as ye may rede; Tak heed now of this grete gentil-man, This Troyan, that so wel her plesen can, That feineth him so trewe and obeising, So gentil and so privy of his doing, And can so wel doon alle his obeisaunces, And waiten her at festes and at daunces, And when she goth to temple and hoom ageyn, And fasten til he hath his lady seyn, And bere in his devyses, for her sake, Noot I nat what; and songes wolde he make, Iusten, and doon of armes many thinges, Sende her lettres, tokens, broches, ringes— Now herkneth, how he shal his lady serve! Ther-as he was in peril for to sterve For hunger, and for mischeef in the see, And desolat, and fled from his contree, And al his folk with tempest al to-driven, She hath her body and eek her reame yiven In-to his hond, ther-as she mighte have been Of other lond than of Cartage a queen, And lived in Ioye y-nogh; what wolde ye more? This Eneas, that hath so depe y-swore, Is wery of his craft with-in a throwe; The hote ernest is al over-blowe. And prively he doth his shippes dighte, And shapeth him to stele a-wey by nighte. This Dido hath suspecioun of this, And thoughte wel, that hit was al a-mis; For in his bedde he lyth a-night and syketh; She asketh him anoon, what him mislyketh— ‘My dere herte, which that I love most?’ ‘Certes,’ quod he, ‘this night my fadres gost Hath in my sleep so sore me tormented, And eek Mercurie his message hath presented, That nedes to the conquest of Itaile My destinee is sone for to saile; For which, me thinketh, brosten is myn herte!’ Ther-with his false teres out they sterte; And taketh her with-in his armes two. ‘Is that in ernest,’ quod she; ‘wil ye so? Have ye nat sworn to wyve me to take, Alas! what womman wil ye of me make? I am a gentil-woman and a queen, Ye wil nat fro your wyf thus foule fleen? That I was born! allas! what shal I do?’ To telle in short, this noble queen Dido, She seketh halwes, and doth sacrifyse; She kneleth, cryeth, that routhe is to devyse; Coniureth him, and profreth him to be His thral, his servant in the leste gree; She falleth him to fote, and swowneth there Dischevele, with her brighte gilte here, And seith, ‘have mercy! let me with yow ryde! Thise lordes, which that wonen me besyde Wil me destroyen only for your sake. And, so ye wil me now to wyve take, As ye han sworn, than wol I yive yow leve To sleen me with your swerd now sone at eve! For than yit shal I dyen as your wyf. I am with childe, and yive my child his lyf. Mercy, lord! have pite in your thoght!’ But al this thing availeth her right noght; For on a night, slepinge, he let her lye, And stal a-wey un-to his companye, And, as a traitour, forth he gan to saile Toward the large contree of Itaile. Thus hath he laft Dido in wo and pyne; And wedded ther a lady hight Lavyne. A cloth he lafte, and eek his swerd stonding, Whan he fro Dido stal in her sleping, Right at her beddes heed, so gan he hye Whan that he stal a-wey to his navye; Which cloth, whan sely Dido gan awake, She hath hit kist ful ofte for his sake; And seide, ‘O cloth, whyl Iupiter hit leste, Tak now my soule, unbind me of this unreste! I have fulfild of fortune al the cours.’ And thus, allas! with-outen his socours, Twenty tyme y-swowned hath she thanne. And, whan that she un-to her suster Anne Compleyned had, of which I may nat wryte— So greet a routhe I have hit for tendyte— And bad her norice and her suster goon To fecchen fyr and other thing anoon, And seide, that she wolde sacrifye. And, whan she mighte her tyme wel espye, Up-on the fyr of sacrifys she sterte, And with his swerd she roof her to the herte. But, as myn autour seith, right thus she seyde; Or she was hurt, before that she deyde, She wroot a lettre anoon, that thus began:— ‘Right so,’ quod she, ‘as that the whyte swan Ayeins his deeth beginneth for to singe, Right so to yow make I my compleyninge. Nat that I trowe to geten yow again, For wel I woot that it is al in vain, Sin that the goddes been contraire to me. But sin my name is lost through yow,’ quod she, ‘I may wel lese a word on yow, or letter, Al-be-it that I shal be never the better; For thilke wind that blew your ship a-wey, The same wind hath blowe a-wey your fey.’— But who wol al this letter have in minde, Rede Ovide, and in him he shal hit finde.

Thou rote of false lovers, duk Iasoun! Thou sly devourer and confusioun Of gentil-wommen, tender creatures, Thou madest thy reclaiming and thy lures To ladies of thy statly apparaunce, And of thy wordes, farced with plesaunce, And of thy feyned trouthe and thy manere, With thyn obeisaunce and thy humble chere, And with thy counterfeted peyne and wo. Ther other falsen oon, thou falsest two! O! ofte swore thou that thou woldest dye For love, whan thou ne feltest maladye Save foul delyt, which that thou callest love! If that I live, thy name shal be shove In English, that thy sleighte shal be knowe! Have at thee, Iasoun! now thyn horn is blowe! But certes, hit is bothe routhe and wo That love with false loveres werketh so; For they shul have wel better love and chere Than he that hath aboght his love ful dere, Or had in armes many a blody box. For ever as tendre a capoun et the fox, Thogh he be fals and hath the foul betrayed, As shal the good-man that ther-for hath payed. Al have he to the capoun skille and right, The false fox wol have his part at night. On Iasoun this ensample is wel y-sene By Isiphile and Medea the quene. In Tessalye, as Guido telleth us, Ther was a king that highte Pelleus, That had a brother, which that highte Eson; And, whan for age he mighte unnethes gon, He yaf to Pelleus the governing Of al his regne, and made him lord and king. Of which Eson this Iasoun geten was, That, in his tyme, in al that lond, ther nas Nat swich a famous knight of gentilesse, Of freedom, and of strengthe and lustinesse. After his fader deeth, he bar him so That ther nas noon that liste been his fo, But dide him al honour and companye; Of which this Pelleus hath greet envye, Imagining that Iasoun mighte be Enhaunsed so, and put in swich degree With love of lordes of his regioun, That from his regne he may be put adoun. And in his wit, a-night, compassed he How Iasoun mighte best destroyed be Withoute slaunder of his compasment. And at the laste he took avisement To senden him in-to som fer contree Ther as this Iasoun may destroyed be. This was his wit; al made he to Iasoun Gret chere of love and of affeccioun, For drede lest his lordes hit espyde. So fil hit so, as fame renneth wyde, Ther was swich tyding over-al and swich los, That in an yle that called was Colcos, Beyonde Troye, estward in the see, That ther-in was a ram, that men mighte see, That had a flees of gold, that shoon so brighte, That no-wher was ther swich an-other sighte; But hit was kept alway with a dragoun, And many othere merveils, up and doun, And with two boles, maked al of bras, That spitten fyr, and moche thing ther was. But this was eek the tale, nathelees, That who-so wolde winne thilke flees, He moste bothe, or he hit winne mighte, With the boles and the dragoun fighte; And king Oëtes lord was of that yle. This Pelleus bethoghte upon this wyle; That he his nevew Iasoun wolde enhorte To sailen to that lond, him to disporte, And seide, ‘Nevew, if hit mighte be That swich a worship mighte fallen thee, That thou this famous tresor mightest winne, And bringen hit my regioun with-inne, Hit were to me gret plesaunce and honour; Than were I holde to quyte thy labour. And al the cost I wol my-selven make; And chees what folk that thou wilt with thee take; Lat see now, darstow taken this viage?’ Iasoun was yong, and lusty of corage, And under-took to doon this ilke empryse. Anoon Argus his shippes gan devyse; With Iasoun wente the stronge Ercules, And many an-other that he with him chees. But who-so axeth who is with him gon, Lat him go reden Argonauticon, For he wol telle a tale long y-now. Philotetes anoon the sail up-drow, Whan that the wind was good, and gan him hye Out of his contree called Tessalye. So long he sailed in the salte see Til in the yle Lemnoun aryved he— Al be this nat rehersed of Guido, Yet seith Ovyde in his Epistles so— And of this yle lady was and quene The faire yonge Isiphilee, the shene, That whylom Thoas doghter was, the king. Isiphilee was goon in her playing; And, roming on the clyves by the see, Under a banke anoon espyed she Wher that the ship of Iasoun gan aryve. Of her goodnesse adoun she sendeth blyve To witen yif that any straunge wight With tempest thider were y-blowe a-night, To doon him socour; as was her usaunce To forthren every wight, and doon plesaunce Of veray bountee and of curtesye. This messagere adoun him gan to hye, And fond Iasoun, and Ercules also, That in a cogge to londe were y-go Hem to refresshen and to take the eyr. The morwening atempre was and fair; And in his wey the messagere hem mette. Ful cunningly thise lordes two he grette, And dide his message, axing hem anoon Yif they were broken, or oght wo begoon, Or hadde nede of lodesmen or vitaile; For of socour they shulde no-thing faile, For hit was utterly the quenes wille. Iasoun answerde, mekely and stille, ‘My lady,’ quod he, ‘thanke I hertely Of hir goodnesse; us nedeth, trewely, No-thing as now, but that we wery be, And come for to pleye, out of the see, Til that the wind be better in our weye.’ This lady rometh by the clif to pleye, With her meynee, endelong the stronde, And fynt this Iasoun and this other stonde, In spekinge of this thing, as I yow tolde. This Ercules and Iasoun gan beholde How that the quene hit was, and faire her grette Anon-right as they with this lady mette; And she took heed, and knew, by hir manere, By hir aray, by wordes and by chere, That hit were gentil-men, of greet degree. And to the castel with her ledeth she Thise straunge folk, and doth hem greet honour, And axeth hem of travail and labour That they han suffred in the salte see; So that, within a day, or two, or three, She knew, by folk that in his shippes be, That hit was Iasoun, ful of renomee, And Ercules, that had the grete los, That soghten the aventures of Colcos; And dide hem honour more then before, And with hem deled ever lenger the more, For they ben worthy folk, with-outen lees. And namely, most she spak with Ercules; To him her herte bar, he sholde be Sad, wys, and trewe, of wordes avisee, With-outen any other affeccioun Of love, or evil imaginacioun. This Ercules hath so this Iasoun preysed, That to the sonne he hath him up areysed, That half so trewe a man ther nas of love Under the cope of heven that is above; And he was wys, hardy, secree, and riche.— Of thise three pointes ther nas noon him liche; Of freedom passed he, and lustihede, Alle tho that liven or ben dede; Ther-to so greet a gentil-man was he, And of Tessalie lykly king to be. Ther nas no lak, but that he was agast To love, and for to speke shamefast. He hadde lever him-self to mordre, and dye Than that men shulde a lover him espye:— ‘As wolde almighty god that I had yive My blood and flesh, so that I mighte live, With the nones that he hadde o-wher a wyf For his estat; for swich a lusty lyf She sholde lede with this lusty knight!’ And al this was compassed on the night Betwixe him Iasoun and this Ercules. Of thise two heer was mad a shrewed lees To come to hous upon an innocent; For to be-dote this queen was hir assent. And Iasoun is as coy as is a maide, He loketh pitously, but noght he saide, But frely yaf he to her conseileres Yiftes grete, and to her officeres. As wolde god I leiser hadde, and tyme, By proces al his wowing for to ryme. But in this hous if any fals lover be, Right as him-self now doth, right so dide he, With feyning and with every sotil dede. Ye gete no more of me, but ye wil rede Thoriginal, that telleth al the cas. The somme is this, that Iasoun wedded was Unto this quene, and took of her substaunce What-so him liste, unto his purveyaunce; And upon her begat he children two, And drow his sail, and saw her never-mo. A lettre sente she to him certein, Which were to long to wryten and to sein, And him repreveth of his grete untrouthe, And preyeth him on her to have som routhe. And of his children two, she seide him this, That they be lyke, of alle thing, y-wis, To Iasoun, save they coude nat begyle; And preyed god, or hit were longe whyle, That she, that had his herte y-raft her fro, Moste finden him to her untrewe al-so, And that she moste bothe her children spille, And alle tho that suffreth him his wille. And trew to Iasoun was she al her lyf, And ever kepte her chast, as for his wyf; Ne never had she Ioye at her herte, But dyed, for his love, of sorwes smerte. Part II. The Legend of Medea. To Colcos comen is this duk Iasoun, That is of love devourer and dragoun. As matere appetyteth forme al-wey, And from forme in-to forme hit passen may, Or as a welle that were botomlees, Right so can fals Iasoun have no pees. For, to desyren, through his appetyt, To doon with gentil wommen his delyt, This is his lust and his felicitee. Iasoun is romed forth to the citee, That whylom cleped was Iaconitos, That was the maister-toun of al Colcos, And hath y-told the cause of his coming Un-to Oëtes, of that contre king, Preying him that he moste doon his assay To gete the flees of gold, if that he may; Of which the king assenteth to his bone, And doth him honour, as hit is to done, So ferforth, that his doghter and his eyr, Medea, which that was so wys and fair That fairer saw ther never man with yë, He made her doon to Iasoun companye At mete, and sitte by him in the halle. Now was Iasoun a semely man with-alle, And lyk a lord, and had a greet renoun, And of his loke as real as leoun, And goodly of his speche, and famulere, And coude of love al craft and art plenere With-oute boke, with everich observaunce. And, as fortune her oghte a foul meschaunce, She wex enamoured upon this man. ‘Iasoun,’ quod she, ‘for ought I see or can, As of this thing the which ye been aboute, Ye han your-self y-put in moche doute. For, who-so wol this aventure acheve, He may nat wel asterten, as I leve, With-outen deeth, but I his helpe be. But natheles, hit is my wille,’ quod she, ‘To forthren yow, so that ye shal nat dye, But turnen, sound, hoom to your Tessalye.’ ‘My righte lady,’ quod this Iasoun tho, ‘That ye han of my dethe or of my wo Any reward, and doon me this honour, I wot wel that my might ne my labour May nat deserve hit in my lyves day; God thanke yow, ther I ne can ne may. Your man am I, and lowly you beseche, To been my help, with-oute more speche; But certes, for my deeth shal I nat spare.’ Tho gan this Medea to him declare The peril of this cas, fro point to point, And of his batail, and in what disioint He mote stande, of which no creature, Save only she, ne mighte his lyf assure. And shortly, to the point right for to go, They been accorded ful, betwix hem two, That Iasoun shal her wedde, as trewe knight; And term y-set, to come sone at night Unto her chambre, and make ther his ooth, Upon the goddes, that he, for leef ne looth, Ne sholde her never falsen, night ne day, To been her husbond, whyl he liven may, As she that from his deeth him saved here. And her-upon, at night they mette y-fere, And doth his ooth, and goth with her to bedde. And on the morwe, upward he him spedde; For she hath taught him how he shal nat faile The flees to winne, and stinten his bataile; And saved him his lyf and his honour; And gat him greet name as a conquerour Right through the sleight of her enchantement. Now hath Iasoun the flees, and hoom is went With Medea, and tresor ful gret woon. But unwist of her fader is she goon To Tessaly, with duk Iasoun her leef, That afterward hath broght her to mescheef. For as a traitour he is from her go, And with her lafte his yonge children two, And falsly hath betrayed her, allas! And ever in love a cheef traitour he was; And wedded yit the thridde wyf anon, That was the doghter of the king Creon. This is the meed of loving and guerdon That Medea received of Iasoun Right for her trouthe and for her kindenesse, That loved him better than her-self, I gesse, And lafte her fader and her heritage. And of Iasoun this is the vassalage, That, in his dayes, nas ther noon y-founde So fals a lover going on the grounde. And therfor in her lettre thus she seyde First, whan she of his falsnesse him umbreyde, ‘Why lyked me thy yelow heer to see More then the boundes of myn honestee, Why lyked me thy youthe and thy fairnesse, And of thy tonge the infinit graciousnesse? O, haddest thou in thy conquest deed y-be, Ful mikel untrouthe had ther dyed with thee!’ Wel can Ovyde her lettre in vers endyte, Which were as now to long for me to wryte. Explicit Legenda Ysiphile et Medee, Martirum. V. THE LEGEND OF LUCRETIA. Incipit Legenda Lucrecie Rome, martiris. Now moot I seyn the exiling of kinges Of Rome, for hir horrible doinges, And of the laste king Tarquinius, As saith Ovyde and Titus Livius. But for that cause telle I nat this storie, But for to preise and drawen to memorie The verray wyf, the verray trewe Lucresse, That, for her wyfhood and her stedfastnesse, Nat only that thise payens her comende, But he, that cleped is in our legende The grete Austin, hath greet compassioun Of this Lucresse, that starf at Rome toun; And in what wyse, I wol but shortly trete, And of this thing I touche but the grete. Whan Ardea beseged was aboute With Romains, that ful sterne were and stoute, Ful longe lay the sege, and litel wroghte, So that they were half ydel, as hem thoghte; And in his pley Tarquinius the yonge Gan for to iape, for he was light of tonge, And seyde, that ‘it was an ydel lyf; No man did ther no more than his wyf; And lat us speke of wyves, that is best; Praise every man his owne, as him lest, And with our speche lat us ese our herte.’ A knight, that highte Colatyne, up sterte, And seyde thus, ‘nay, for hit is no nede To trowen on the word, but on the dede. I have a wyf,’ quod he, ‘that, as I trowe, Is holden good of alle that ever her knowe; Go we to-night to Rome, and we shul see.’ Tarquinius answerde, ‘that lyketh me.’ To Rome be they come, and faste hem dighte To Colatynes hous, and doun they lighte, Tarquinius, and eek this Colatyne. The husbond knew the estres wel and fyne, And prively into the hous they goon; Nor at the gate porter was ther noon; And at the chambre-dore they abyde. This noble wyf sat by her beddes syde Dischevele, for no malice she ne thoghte; And softe wolle our book seith that she wroghte To kepen her fro slouthe and ydelnesse; And bad her servants doon hir businesse, And axeth hem, ‘what tydings heren ye? How seith men of the sege, how shal hit be? God wolde the walles weren falle adoun; Myn husbond is so longe out of this toun, For which the dreed doth me so sore smerte, Right as a swerd hit stingeth to myn herte Whan I think on the sege or of that place; God save my lord, I preye him for his grace:’— And ther-with-al ful tenderly she weep, And of her werk she took no more keep, But mekely she leet her eyen falle; And thilke semblant sat her wel with-alle. And eek her teres, ful of honestee, Embelisshed her wyfly chastitee; Her countenaunce is to her herte digne, For they acordeden in dede and signe. And with that word her husbond Colatyn, Or she of him was war, com sterting in, And seide, ‘dreed thee noght, for I am here!’ And she anoon up roos, with blisful chere, And kiste him, as of wyves is the wone. Tarquinius, this proude kinges sone, Conceived hath her beautee and her chere, Her yelow heer, her shap, and her manere, Her hew, her wordes that she hath compleyned, And by no crafte her beautee nas nat feyned; And caughte to this lady swich desyr, That in his herte brende as any fyr So woodly, that his wit was al forgeten. For wel, thoghte he, she sholde nat be geten; And ay the more that he was in dispair, The more he coveteth and thoghte her fair. His blinde lust was al his covetinge. A-morwe, whan the brid began to singe, Unto the sege he comth ful privily, And by himself he walketh sobrely, Thimage of her recording alwey newe; ‘Thus lay her heer, and thus fresh was her hewe; Thus sat, thus spak, thus span; this was her chere, Thus fair she was, and this was her manere.’ Al this conceit his herte hath now y-take. And, as the see, with tempest al to-shake, That, after whan the storm is al ago, Yet wol the water quappe a day or two, Right so, thogh that her forme wer absent, The plesaunce of her forme was present; But natheles, nat plesaunce, but delyt, Or an unrightful talent with despyt; ‘For, maugre her, she shal my lemman be; Hap helpeth hardy man alday,’ quod he; ‘What ende that I make, hit shal be so;’ And girt him with his swerde, and gan to go; And forth he rit til he to Rome is come, And al aloon his wey than hath he nome Unto the house of Colatyn ful right. Doun was the sonne, and day hath lost his light; And in he com un-to a privy halke, And in the night ful theefly gan he stalke, Whan every night was to his reste broght, Ne no wight had of tresoun swich a thoght. Were hit by window or by other gin, With swerde y-drawe, shortly he comth in Ther as she lay, this noble wyf Lucresse. And, as she wook, her bed she felte presse. ‘What beste is that,’ quod she, ‘that weyeth thus?’ ‘I am the kinges sone, Tarquinius,’ Quod he, ‘but and thou crye, or noise make, Or if thou any creature awake, By thilke god that formed man on lyve, This swerd through-out thyn herte shal I ryve.’ And ther-withal unto her throte he sterte, And sette the point al sharp upon her herte. No word she spak, she hath no might therto. What shal she sayn? her wit is al ago. Right as a wolf that fynt a lomb aloon, To whom shal she compleyne, or make moon? What! shal she fighte with an hardy knight? Wel wot men that a woman hath no might. What! shal she crye, or how shal she asterte That hath her by the throte, with swerde at herte? She axeth grace, and seith al that she can. ‘Ne wolt thou nat,’ quod he, this cruel man, ‘As wisly Iupiter my soule save, As I shal in the stable slee thy knave, And leye him in thy bed, and loude crye, That I thee finde in suche avouterye; And thus thou shalt be deed, and also lese Thy name, for thou shalt non other chese.’ Thise Romain wyves loveden so hir name At thilke tyme, and dredden so the shame, That, what for fere of slaundre and drede of deeth, She loste bothe at-ones wit and breeth, And in a swough she lay and wex so deed, Men mighte smyten of her arm or heed; She feleth no-thing, neither foul ne fair. Tarquinius, that art a kinges eyr, And sholdest, as by linage and by right, Doon as a lord and as a verray knight, Why hastow doon dispyt to chivalrye? Why hastow doon this lady vilanye? Allas! of thee this was a vileins dede! But now to purpos; in the story I rede, Whan he was goon, al this mischaunce is falle. This lady sente after her frendes alle, Fader, moder, husbond, al y-fere; And al dischevele, with her heres clere, In habit swich as women used tho Unto the burying of her frendes go, She sit in halle with a sorweful sighte. Her frendes axen what her aylen mighte, And who was deed? And she sit ay wepinge, A word for shame ne may she forth out-bringe, Ne upon hem she dorste nat beholde. But atte laste of Tarquiny she hem tolde, This rewful cas, and al this thing horrible. The wo to tellen hit were impossible, That she and alle her frendes made atones. Al hadde folkes hertes been of stones, Hit mighte have maked hem upon her rewe, Her herte was so wyfly and so trewe. She seide, that, for her gilt ne for her blame, Her husbond sholde nat have the foule name, That wolde she nat suffre, by no wey. And they answerden alle, upon hir fey, That they foryeve hit her, for hit was right; Hit was no gilt, hit lay nat in her might; And seiden her ensamples many oon. But al for noght; for thus she seide anoon, ‘Be as be may,’ quod she, ‘of forgiving, I wol nat have no forgift for no-thing.’ But prively she caughte forth a knyf, And therwith-al she rafte her-self her lyf; And as she fel adoun, she caste her look, And of her clothes yit she hede took; For in her falling yit she hadde care Lest that her feet or swiche thing lay bare; So wel she loved clennesse and eek trouthe. Of her had al the toun of Rome routhe, And Brutus by her chaste blode hath swore That Tarquin sholde y-banisht be ther-fore, And al his kin; and let the peple calle, And openly the tale he tolde hem alle, And openly let carie her on a bere Through al the toun, that men may see and here The horrible deed of her oppressioun. Ne never was ther king in Rome toun Sin thilke day; and she was holden there A seint, and ever her day y-halwed dere As in hir lawe: and thus endeth Lucresse, The noble wyf, as Titus bereth witnesse. I tell hit, for she was of love so trewe, Ne in her wille she chaunged for no newe. And for the stable herte, sad and kinde, That in these women men may alday finde; Ther as they caste hir herte, ther hit dwelleth. For wel I wot, that Crist him-selve telleth, That in Israel, as wyd as is the lond, That so gret feith in al the lond he ne fond As in a woman; and this is no lye. And as of men, loketh which tirannye They doon alday; assay hem who so liste, The trewest is ful brotel for to triste. Explicit Legenda Lucrecie Rome, Martiris. VI. THE LEGEND OF ARIADNE. Incipit Legenda Adriane de Athenes. Iuge infernal, Minos, of Crete king, Now cometh thy lot, now comestow on the ring; Nat for thy sake only wryte I this storie, But for to clepe agein unto memorie Of Theseus the grete untrouthe of love; For which the goddes of the heven above Ben wrothe, and wreche han take for thy sinne. Be reed for shame! now I thy lyf beginne. Minos, that was the mighty king of Crete, That hadde an hundred citees stronge and grete, To scole hath sent his sone Androgeus, To Athenes; of the whiche hit happed thus, That he was slayn, lerning philosophye, Right in that citee, nat but for envye. The grete Minos, of the whiche I speke, His sones deeth is comen for to wreke; Alcathoe he bisegeth harde and longe. But natheles the walles be so stronge, And Nisus, that was king of that citee, So chivalrous, that litel dredeth he; Of Minos or his ost took he no cure, Til on a day befel an aventure, That Nisus doghter stood upon the wal, And of the sege saw the maner al. So happed hit, that, at a scarmishing, She caste her herte upon Minos the king, For his beautee and for his chivalrye, So sore, that she wende for to dye. And, shortly of this proces for to pace, She made Minos winnen thilke place, So that the citee was al at his wille, To saven whom him list, or elles spille; But wikkedly he quitte her kindenesse, And let her drenche in sorowe and distresse, Nere that the goddes hadde of her pite; But that tale were to long as now for me. Athenes wan this king Minos also, And Alcathoe and other tounes mo; And this theffect, that Minos hath so driven Hem of Athenes, that they mote him yiven Fro yere to yere her owne children dere For to be slayn, as ye shul after here. This Minos hath a monstre, a wikked beste, That was so cruel that, without areste, Whan that a man was broght in his presence, He wolde him ete, ther helpeth no defence. And every thridde yeer, with-outen doute, They casten lot, and, as hit com aboute On riche, on pore, he moste his sone take, And of his child he moste present make Unto Minos, to save him or to spille, Or lete his beste devoure him at his wille. And this hath Minos don, right in despyt; To wreke his sone was set al his delyt, And maken hem of Athenes his thral Fro yere to yere, whyl that he liven shal; And hoom he saileth whan this toun is wonne. This wikked custom is so longe y-ronne Til that of Athenes king Egeus Mot sende his owne sone, Theseus, Sith that the lot is fallen him upon, To be devoured, for grace is ther non. And forth is lad this woful yonge knight Unto the court of king Minos ful right, And in a prison, fetered, cast is he Til thilke tyme he sholde y-freten be. Wel maystow wepe, O woful Theseus, That art a kinges sone, and dampned thus. Me thinketh this, that thou were depe y-holde To whom that saved thee fro cares colde! And now, if any woman helpe thee, Wel oughtestow her servant for to be, And been her trewe lover yeer by yere! But now to come ageyn to my matere. The tour, ther as this Theseus is throwe Doun in the botom derke and wonder lowe, Was ioyning in the walle to a foreyne; And hit was longing to the doghtren tweyne Of king Minos, that in hir chambres grete Dwelten above, toward the maister-strete, In mochel mirthe, in Ioye and in solas. Not I nat how, hit happed ther, per cas, As Theseus compleyned him by nighte, The kinges doghter, Adrian that highte, And eek her suster Phedra, herden al His compleyning, as they stode on the wal And lokeden upon the brighte mone; Hem leste nat to go to bedde sone. And of his wo they had compassioun; A kinges sone to ben in swich prisoun And be devoured, thoughte hem gret pitee. Than Adrian spak to her suster free, And seyde, ‘Phedra, leve suster dere, This woful lordes sone may ye nat here, How pitously compleyneth he his kin, And eek his pore estat that he is in, And gilteless? now certes, hit is routhe! And if ye wol assenten, by my trouthe, He shal be holpen, how so that we do!’ Phedra answerde, ‘y-wis, me is as wo For him as ever I was for any man; And, to his help, the beste reed I can Is that we doon the gayler prively To come, and speke with us hastily, And doon this woful man with him to come. For if he may this monstre overcome, Than were he quit; ther is noon other bote. Lat us wel taste him at his herte-rote, That, if so be that he a wepen have, Wher that he dar, his lyf to kepe and save, Fighten with this fend, and him defende. For, in the prison, ther he shal descende, Ye wite wel, that the beste is in a place That nis nat derk, and hath roum eek and space To welde an ax or swerd or staf or knyf, So that, me thinketh, he sholde save his lyf; If that he be a man, he shal do so. And we shul make him balles eek also Of wexe and towe, that, whan he gapeth faste, Into the bestes throte he shal hem caste To slake his hunger and encombre his teeth; And right anon, whan that Theseus seeth The beste achoked, he shal on him lepe To sleen him, or they comen more to-hepe. This wepen shal the gayler, or that tyde, Ful privily within the prison hyde; And, for the hous is crinkled to and fro, And hath so queinte weyes for to go— For hit is shapen as the mase is wroght— Therto have I a remedie in my thoght, That, by a clewe of twyne, as he hath goon, The same wey he may returne anoon, Folwing alwey the threed, as he hath come. And, whan that he this beste hath overcome, Then may he fleen awey out of this drede, And eek the gayler may he with him lede, And him avaunce at hoom in his contree, Sin that so greet a lordes sone is he. This is my reed, if that he dar hit take.’ What sholde I lenger sermoun of hit make? The gayler cometh, and with him Theseus. And whan thise thinges been acorded thus, Adoun sit Theseus upon his knee:— ‘The righte lady of my lyf,’ quod he, ‘I, sorweful man, y-dampned to the deeth, Fro yow, whyl that me lasteth lyf or breeth, I wol nat twinne, after this aventure, But in your servise thus I wol endure, That, as a wrecche unknowe, I wol yow serve For ever-mo, til that myn herte sterve. Forsake I wol at hoom myn heritage, And, as I seide, ben of your court a page, If that ye vouche-sauf that, in this place, Ye graunte me to han so gret a grace That I may han nat but my mete and drinke; And for my sustenance yit wol I swinke, Right as yow list, that Minos ne no wight— Sin that he saw me never with eyen sight— Ne no man elles, shal me conne espye; So slyly and so wel I shal me gye, And me so wel disfigure and so lowe, That in this world ther shal no man me knowe, To han my lyf, and for to han presence Of yow, that doon to me this excellence. And to my fader shal I senden here This worthy man, that is now your gaylere, And, him to guerdon, that he shal wel be Oon of the grettest men of my contree. And yif I dorste seyn, my lady bright, I am a kinges sone, and eek a knight; As wolde god, yif that hit mighte be Ye weren in my contree, alle three, And I with yow, to bere yow companye, Than shulde ye seen yif that I ther-of lye! And, if I profre yow in low manere To ben your page and serven yow right here, But I yow serve as lowly in that place, I prey to Mars to yive me swiche a grace That shames deeth on me ther mote falle, And deeth and povert to my frendes alle; And that my spirit by nighte mote go After my deeth, and walke to and fro; That I mote of a traitour have a name, For which my spirit go, to do me shame! And yif I ever claime other degree, But-if ye vouche-sauf to yive hit me, As I have seid, of shames deeth I deye! And mercy, lady! I can nat elles seye!’ A seemly knight was Theseus to see, And yong, but of a twenty yeer and three; But who-so hadde y-seyn his countenaunce, He wolde have wept, for routhe of his penaunce; For which this Adriane in this manere Answerde to his profre and to his chere. ‘A kinges sone, and eek a knight,’ quod she, ‘To been my servant in so low degree, God shilde hit, for the shame of women alle! And leve me never swich a cas befalle! But sende yow grace and sleighte of herte also, Yow to defende and knightly sleen your fo, And leve herafter that I may yow finde To me and to my suster here so kinde, That I repente nat to give yow lyf! Yit were hit better that I were your wyf, Sin that ye been as gentil born as I, And have a rëaume, nat but faste by, Then that I suffred giltles yow to sterve, Or that I let yow as a page serve; Hit is not profit, as unto your kinrede; But what is that man nil do for drede? And to my suster, sin that hit is so That she mot goon with me, if that I go, Or elles suffre deeth as wel as I, That ye unto your sone as trewely Doon her be wedded at your hoom-coming. This is the fynal ende of al this thing; Ye swere hit heer, on al that may be sworn.’ ‘Ye, lady myn,’ quod he, ‘or elles torn Mote I be with the Minotaur to-morwe! And haveth her-of my herte-blood to borwe, Yif that ye wile; if I had knyf or spere, I wolde hit leten out, and ther-on swere, For than at erst I wot ye wil me leve. By Mars, that is the cheef of my bileve, So that I mighte liven and nat faile To-morwe for tacheve my bataile, I nolde never fro this place flee, Til that ye shuld the verray preve see. For now, if that the sooth I shal yow say, I have y-loved yow ful many a day, Thogh ye ne wiste hit nat, in my contree. And aldermost desyred yow to see Of any erthly living creature; Upon my trouthe I swere, and yow assure, Thise seven yeer I have your servant be; Now have I yow, and also have ye me, My dere herte, of Athenes duchesse!’ This lady smyleth at his stedfastnesse, And at his hertly wordes, and his chere, And to her suster seide in this manere, Al softely, ‘now, suster myn,’ quod she, ‘Now be we duchesses, bothe I and ye, And sikered to the regals of Athenes, And bothe her-after lykly to be quenes, And saved fro his deeth a kinges sone, As ever of gentil women is the wone To save a gentil man, emforth hir might, In honest cause, and namely in his right. Me thinketh no wight oghte her-of us blame, Ne beren us ther-for an evel name.’ And shortly of this matere for to make, This Theseus of her hath leve y-take, And every point performed was in dede As ye have in this covenant herd me rede. His wepen, his clew, his thing that I have said, Was by the gayler in the hous y-laid Ther as this Minotaur hath his dwelling, Right faste by the dore, at his entring. And Theseus is lad unto his deeth, And forth un-to this Minotaur he geeth, And by the teching of this Adriane He overcom this beste, and was his bane; And out he cometh by the clewe again Ful prevely, whan he this beste hath slain; And by the gayler geten hath a barge, And of his wyves tresor gan hit charge, And took his wyf, and eek her suster free, And eek the gayler, and with hem alle three Is stole awey out of the lond by nighte, And to the contre of Ennopye him dighte Ther as he had a frend of his knowinge. Ther festen they, ther dauncen they and singe; And in his armes hath this Adriane, That of the beste hath kept him from his bane; And gat him ther a newe barge anoon, And of his contree-folk a ful gret woon, And taketh his leve, and hoomward saileth he. And in an yle, amid the wilde see, Ther as ther dwelte creature noon Save wilde bestes, and that ful many oon, He made his ship a-londe for to sette; And in that yle half a day he lette, And seide, that on the lond he moste him reste. His mariners han doon right as him leste; And, for to tellen shortly in this cas, Whan Adriane his wyf a-slepe was, For that her suster fairer was than she, He taketh her in his hond, and forth goth he To shippe, and as a traitour stal his way Whyl that this Adriane a-slepe lay, And to his contree-ward he saileth blyve— A twenty devil way the wind him dryve!— And fond his fader drenched in the see. Me list no more to speke of him, parde; Thise false lovers, poison be hir bane! But I wol turne again to Adriane That is with slepe for werinesse atake. Ful sorwefully her herte may awake. Allas! for thee my herte hath now pite! Right in the dawening awaketh she, And gropeth in the bedde, and fond right noght. ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘that ever I was wroght! I am betrayed!’ and her heer to-rente, And to the stronde bar-fot faste she wente, And cryed, ‘Theseus! myn herte swete! Wher be ye, that I may nat with yow mete, And mighte thus with bestes been y-slain?’ The holwe rokkes answerde her again; No man she saw, and yit shyned the mone, And hye upon a rokke she wente sone, And saw his barge sailing in the see. Cold wex her herte, and right thus seide she. ‘Meker than ye finde I the bestes wilde!’ Hadde he nat sinne, that her thus begylde? She cryed, ‘O turne again, for routhe and sinne! Thy barge hath nat al his meiny inne!’ Her kerchef on a pole up stikked she, Ascaunce that he sholde hit wel y-see, And him remembre that she was behinde, And turne again, and on the stronde her finde; But al for noght; his wey he is y-goon. And doun she fil a-swown upon a stoon; And up she rist, and kiste, in al her care, The steppes of his feet, ther he hath fare, And to her bedde right thus she speketh tho:— ‘Thou bed,’ quod she, ‘that hast receyved two, Thou shalt answere of two, and nat of oon! Wher is thy gretter part away y-goon? Allas! wher shal I, wrecched wight, become! For, thogh so be that ship or boot heer come, Hoom to my contree dar I nat for drede; I can my-selven in this cas nat rede!’ What shal I telle more her compleining? Hit is so long, hit were an hevy thing. In her epistle Naso telleth al; But shortly to the ende I telle shal. The goddes have her holpen, for pitee; And, in the signe of Taurus, men may see The stones of her coroun shyne clere.— I wol no more speke of this matere; But thus this false lover can begyle His trewe love. The devil quyte him his whyle! Explicit Legenda Adriane de Athenes. VII. THE LEGEND OF PHILOMELA. Incipit Legenda Philomene. Deus dator formarum. Thou yiver of the formes, that hast wroght The faire world, and bare hit in thy thoght Eternally, or thou thy werk began, Why madest thou, unto the slaundre of man, Or—al be that hit was not thy doing, As for that fyn to make swiche a thing— Why suffrest thou that Tereus was bore, That is in love so fals and so forswore, That, fro this world up to the firste hevene, Corrumpeth, whan that folk his name nevene? And, as to me, so grisly was his dede, That, whan that I his foule story rede, Myn eyen wexen foule and sore also; Yit last the venim of so longe ago, That hit enfecteth him that wol beholde The story of Tereus, of which I tolde. Of Trace was he lord, and kin to Marte, The cruel god that stant with blody darte; And wedded had he, with a blisful chere, King Pandiones faire doghter dere, That highte Progne, flour of her contree, Thogh Iuno list nat at the feste be, Ne Ymeneus, that god of wedding is; But at the feste redy been, y-wis, The furies three, with alle hir mortel brond. The owle al night aboute the balkes wond, That prophet is of wo and of mischaunce. This revel, ful of songe and ful of daunce, Lasteth a fourtenight, or litel lasse. But, shortly of this story for to passe, For I am wery of him for to telle, Five yeer his wyf and he togeder dwelle, Til on a day she gan so sore longe To seen her suster, that she saw nat longe, That for desyr she niste what to seye. But to her husband gan she for to preye, For goddes love, that she moste ones goon Her suster for to seen, and come anoon, Or elles, but she moste to her wende, She preyde him, that he wolde after her sende; And this was, day by day, al her prayere With al humblesse of wyfhood, word, and chere. This Tereus let make his shippes yare, And into Grece him-self is forth y-fare Unto his fader in lawe, and gan him preye To vouche-sauf that, for a month or tweye, That Philomene, his wyves suster, mighte On Progne his wyf but ones have a sighte— ‘And she shal come to yow again anoon. Myself with her wol bothe come and goon, And as myn hertes lyf I wol her kepe.’ This olde Pandion, this king, gan wepe For tendernesse of herte, for to leve His doghter goon, and for to yive her leve; Of al this world he lovede no-thing so; But at the laste leve hath she to go. For Philomene, with salte teres eke, Gan of her fader grace to beseke To seen her suster, that her longeth so; And him embraceth with her armes two. And therwith-al so yong and fair was she That, whan that Terëus saw her beautee, And of array that ther was noon her liche, And yit of bountee was she two so riche, He caste his fyry herte upon her so That he wol have her, how so that hit go, And with his wyles kneled and so preyde, Til at the laste Pandion thus seyde:— ‘Now, sone,’ quod he, ‘that art to me so dere, I thee betake my yonge doghter here, That bereth the key of al my hertes lyf. And grete wel my doghter and thy wyf, And yive her leve somtyme for to pleye, That she may seen me ones er I deye.’ And soothly, he hath mad him riche feste, And to his folk, the moste and eek the leste, That with him com; and yaf him yiftes grete, And him conveyeth through the maister-strete Of Athenes, and to the see him broghte, And turneth hoom; no malice he ne thoghte. The ores pulleth forth the vessel faste, And into Trace arriveth at the laste, And up into a forest he her ledde, And to a cave privily him spedde; And, in this derke cave, yif her leste, Or leste noght, he bad her for to reste; Of whiche her herte agroos, and seyde thus, ‘Wher is my suster, brother Tereus?’ And therwith-al she wepte tenderly, And quook for fere, pale and pitously, Right as the lamb that of the wolf is biten; Or as the colver, that of the egle is smiten, And is out of his clawes forth escaped, Yet hit is afered and awhaped Lest hit be hent eft-sones, so sat she. But utterly hit may non other be. By force hath he, this traitour, doon that dede, That he hath reft her of her maydenhede, Maugree her heed, by strengthe and by his might. Lo! here a dede of men, and that a right! She cryeth ‘suster!’ with ful loude stevene, And ‘fader dere!’ and ‘help me, god in hevene!’ Al helpeth nat; and yet this false theef Hath doon this lady yet a more mischeef, For fere lest she sholde his shame crye, And doon him openly a vilanye, And with his swerd her tong of kerveth he, And in a castel made her for to be Ful privily in prison evermore, And kepte her to his usage and his store, So that she mighte him nevermore asterte. O sely Philomene! wo is thyn herte; God wreke thee, and sende thee thy bone! Now is hit tyme I make an ende sone. This Tereus is to his wyf y-come, And in his armes hath his wyf y-nome, And pitously he weep, and shook his heed, And swor her that he fond her suster deed; For which this sely Progne hath swich wo, That ny her sorweful herte brak a-two; And thus in teres lete I Progne dwelle, And of her suster forth I wol yow telle. This woful lady lerned had in youthe So that she werken and enbrouden couthe, And weven in her stole the radevore As hit of women hath be woned yore. And, shortly for to seyn, she hath her fille Of mete and drink, and clothing at her wille, And coude eek rede, and wel y-nogh endyte, But with a penne coude she nat wryte; But lettres can she weven to and fro, So that, by that the yeer was al a-go, She had y-woven in a stamin large How she was broght from Athenes in a barge, And in a cave how that she was broght; And al the thing that Tereus hath wroght, She waf hit wel, and wroot the story above, How she was served for her suster love; And to a knave a ring she yaf anoon, And prayed him, by signes, for to goon Unto the quene, and beren her that clooth, And by signes swor him many an ooth, She sholde him yeve what she geten mighte. This knave anoon unto the quene him dighte, And took hit her, and al the maner tolde. And, whan that Progne hath this thing beholde, No word she spak, for sorwe and eek for rage; But feyned her to goon on pilgrimage To Bachus temple; and, in a litel stounde, Her dombe suster sitting hath she founde, Weping in the castel her aloon. Allas! the wo, the compleint, and the moon That Progne upon her dombe suster maketh! In armes everich of hem other taketh, And thus I lete hem in hir sorwe dwelle. The remenant is no charge for to telle, For this is al and som, thus was she served, That never harm a-gilte ne deserved Unto this cruel man, that she of wiste. Ye may be war of men, yif that yow liste. For, al be that he wol nat, for his shame, Doon so as Tereus, to lese his name, Ne serve yow as a mordrour or a knave, Ful litel whyle shul ye trewe him have, That wol I seyn, al were he now my brother, But hit so be that he may have non other. Explicit Legenda Philomene. VIII. THE LEGEND OF PHYLLIS. Incipit Legenda Phillis. By preve as wel as by auctoritee, That wikked fruit cometh of a wikked tree, That may ye finde, if that it lyketh yow. But for this ende I speke this as now, To telle you of false Demophon. In love a falser herde I never non, But-if hit were his fader Theseus. ‘God, for his grace, fro swich oon kepe us!’ Thus may thise women prayen that hit here. Now to theffect turne I of my matere. Destroyed is of Troye the citee; This Demophon com sailing in the see Toward Athenes, to his paleys large; With him com many a ship and many a barge Ful of his folk, of which ful many oon Is wounded sore, and seek, and wo begoon. And they han at the sege longe y-lain. Behinde him com a wind and eek a rain That shoof so sore, his sail ne mighte stonde, Him were lever than al the world a-londe, So hunteth him the tempest to and fro. So derk hit was, he coude nowher go; And with a wawe brosten was his stere. His ship was rent so lowe, in swich manere, That carpenter ne coude hit nat amende. The see, by nighte, as any torche brende For wood, and posseth him now up now doun, Til Neptune hath of him compassioun, And Thetis, Chorus, Triton, and they alle, And maden him upon a lond to falle, Wher-of that Phillis lady was and quene, Ligurgus doghter, fairer on to sene Than is the flour again the brighte sonne. Unnethe is Demophon to londe y-wonne, Wayk and eek wery, and his folk for-pyned Of werinesse, and also enfamyned; And to the deeth he almost was y-driven. His wyse folk to conseil han him yiven To seken help and socour of the queen, And loken what his grace mighte been, And maken in that lond som chevisaunce, To kepen him fro wo and fro mischaunce. For seek was he, and almost at the deeth; Unnethe mighte he speke or drawe his breeth, And lyth in Rodopeya him for to reste. Whan he may walke, him thoughte hit was the beste Unto the court to seken for socour. Men knewe him wel, and diden him honour; For at Athenes duk and lord was he, As Theseus his fader hadde y-be, That in his tyme was of greet renoun, No man so greet in al his regioun; And lyk his fader of face and of stature, And fals of love; hit com him of nature; As doth the fox Renard, the foxes sone, Of kinde he coude his olde faders wone Withoute lore, as can a drake swimme, Whan hit is caught and caried to the brimme. This honourable Phillis doth him chere, Her lyketh wel his port and his manere. But for I am agroted heer-biforn To wryte of hem that been in love forsworn, And eek to haste me in my legende, Which to performe god me grace sende, Therfor I passe shortly in this wyse; Ye han wel herd of Theseus devyse In the betraising of fair Adriane, That of her pite kepte him from his bane. At shorte wordes, right so Demophon The same wey, the same path hath gon That dide his false fader Theseus. For unto Phillis hath he sworen thus, To wedden her, and her his trouthe plighte, And piked of her al the good he mighte, Whan he was hool and sound and hadde his reste; And doth with Phillis what so that him leste. And wel coude I, yif that me leste so, Tellen al his doing to and fro. He seide, unto his contree moste he saile, For ther he wolde her wedding apparaile As fil to her honour and his also. And openly he took his leve tho, And hath her sworn, he wolde nat soiorne, But in a month he wolde again retorne. And in that lond let make his ordinaunce As verray lord, and took the obeisaunce Wel and hoomly, and let his shippes dighte, And hoom he goth the nexte wey he mighte; For unto Phillis yit ne com he noght. And that hath she so harde and sore aboght, Allas! that, as the stories us recorde, She was her owne deeth right with a corde, Whan that she saw that Demophon her trayed. But to him first she wroot and faste him prayed He wolde come, and her deliver of peyne, As I reherse shal a word or tweyne. Me list nat vouche-sauf on him to swinke, Ne spende on him a penne ful of inke, For fals in love was he, right as his syre; The devil sette hir soules bothe a-fyre! But of the lettre of Phillis wol I wryte A word or tweyne, al-thogh hit be but lyte. ‘Thyn hostesse,’ quod she, ‘O Demophon, Thy Phillis, which that is so wo begon, Of Rodopeye, upon yow moot compleyne, Over the terme set betwix us tweyne, That ye ne holden forward, as ye seyde; Your anker, which ye in our haven leyde, Highte us, that ye wolde comen, out of doute, Or that the mone ones wente aboute. But tymes foure the mone hath hid her face Sin thilke day ye wente fro this place, And foure tymes light the world again. But for al that, yif I shal soothly sain, Yit hath the streem of Sitho nat y-broght From Athenes the ship; yit comth hit noght. And, yif that ye the terme rekne wolde, As I or other trewe lovers sholde, I pleyne not, god wot, beforn my day.’— But al her lettre wryten I ne may By ordre, for hit were to me a charge; Her lettre was right long and ther-to large; But here and there in ryme I have hit laid, Ther as me thoughte that she wel hath said.— She seide, ‘thy sailes comen nat again, Ne to thy word ther nis no fey certein; But I wot why ye come nat,’ quod she; ‘For I was of my love to you so free. And of the goddes that ye han forswore, Yif that hir vengeance falle on yow therfore, Ye be nat suffisaunt to bere the peyne. To moche trusted I, wel may I pleyne, Upon your linage and your faire tonge, And on your teres falsly out y-wronge. How coude ye wepe so by craft?’ quod she; ‘May ther swiche teres feyned be? Now certes, yif ye wolde have in memorie, Hit oghte be to yow but litel glorie To have a sely mayde thus betrayed! To god,’ quod she, ‘preye I, and ofte have prayed, That hit be now the grettest prys of alle, And moste honour that ever yow shal befalle! And whan thyn olde auncestres peynted be, In which men may hir worthinesse see, Than, preye I god, thou peynted be also, That folk may reden, for-by as they go, “Lo! this is he, that with his flaterye Betrayed hath and doon her vilanye That was his trewe love in thoghte and dede!” But sothly, of oo point yit may they rede, That ye ben lyk your fader as in this; For he begyled Adriane, y-wis, With swiche an art and swiche sotelte As thou thy-selven hast begyled me. As in that point, al-thogh hit be nat fayr, Thou folwest him, certein, and art his eyr. But sin thus sinfully ye me begyle, My body mote ye seen, within a whyle, Right in the haven of Athenes fletinge, With-outen sepulture and buryinge; Thogh ye ben harder then is any stoon.’ And, whan this lettre was forth sent anoon, And knew how brotel and how fals he was, She for dispeyr for-dide herself, allas! Swich sorwe hath she, for she besette her so. Be war, ye women, of your sotil fo, Sin yit this day men may ensample see; And trusteth, as in love, no man but me. Explicit Legenda Phillis. IX. THE LEGEND OF HYPERMNESTRA. Incipit Legenda Ypermistre. In Grece whylom weren brethren two, Of whiche that oon was called Danao, That many a sone hath of his body wonne, As swiche false lovers ofte conne. Among his sones alle ther was oon That aldermost he lovede of everichoon. And whan this child was born, this Danao Shoop him a name, and called him Lino. That other brother called was Egiste, That was of love as fals as ever him liste, And many a doghter gat he in his lyve; Of which he gat upon his righte wyve A doghter dere, and dide her for to calle Ypermistra, yongest of hem alle; The whiche child, of her nativitee, To alle gode thewes born was she, As lyked to the goddes, or she was born, That of the shefe she sholde be the corn; The Wirdes, that we clepen Destinee, Hath shapen her that she mot nedes be Pitouse, sadde, wyse, and trewe as steel; And to this woman hit accordeth weel. For, though that Venus yaf her greet beautee, With Iupiter compouned so was she That conscience, trouthe, and dreed of shame, And of her wyfhood for to kepe her name, This, thoughte her, was felicitee as here. And rede Mars was, that tyme of the yere, So feble, that his malice is him raft, Repressed hath Venus his cruel craft; What with Venus and other oppressioun Of houses, Mars his venim is adoun, That Ypermistra dar nat handle a knyf In malice, thogh she sholde lese her lyf. But natheles, as heven gan tho turne, To badde aspectes hath she of Saturne, That made her for to deyen in prisoun, As I shal after make mencioun. To Danao and Egistes also— Al-thogh so be that they were brethren two, For thilke tyme nas spared no linage— Hit lyked hem to maken mariage Betwix Ypermistra and him Lino, And casten swiche a day hit shal be so; And ful acorded was hit witterly; The array is wroght, the tyme is faste by. And thus Lino hath of his fadres brother The doghter wedded, and eche of hem hath other. The torches brennen and the lampes brighte, The sacrifices been ful redy dighte; Thencens out of the fyre reketh sote, The flour, the leef is rent up by the rote To maken garlands and corounes hye; Ful is the place of soun of minstralcye, Of songes amorous of mariage, As thilke tyme was the pleyn usage. And this was in the paleys of Egiste, That in his hous was lord, right as him liste; And thus the day they dryven to an ende; The frendes taken leve, and hoom they wende. The night is come, the bryd shal go to bedde; Egiste to his chambre faste him spedde, And privily he let his doghter calle. Whan that the hous was voided of hem alle, He loked on his doghter with glad chere, And to her spak, as ye shul after here. ‘My righte doghter, tresor of myn herte! Sin first that day that shapen was my sherte, Or by the fatal sustren had my dom, So ny myn herte never thing me com As thou, myn Ypermistra, doghter dere! Tak heed what I thy fader sey thee here, And werk after thy wyser ever-mo. For alderfirste, doghter, I love thee so That al the world to me nis half so leef; Ne I nolde rede thee to thy mischeef For al the gode under the colde mone; And what I mene, hit shal be seid right sone, With protestacioun, as in this wyse, That, but thou do as I shal thee devyse, Thou shalt be deed, by him that al hath wroght! At shorte wordes, thou nescapest noght Out of my paleys, or that thou be deed, But thou consente and werke after my reed; Tak this to thee for ful conclusioun.’ This Ypermistra caste her eyen doun, And quook as dooth the leef of aspe grene; Deed wex her hewe, and lyk as ash to sene, And seyde, ‘lord and fader, al your wille, After my might, god wot, I shal fulfille, So hit to me be no confusioun.’ ‘I nil,’ quod he, ‘have noon excepcioun;’ And out he caughte a knyf, as rasour kene; ‘Hyd this,’ quod he, ‘that hit be nat y-sene; And, whan thyn husbond is to bedde y-go, Whyl that he slepeth, cut his throte a-two. For in my dremes hit is warned me How that my nevew shal my bane be, But whiche I noot, wherfor I wol be siker. Yif thou sey nay, we two shul have a biker As I have seyd, by him that I have sworn.’ This Ypermistra hath ny her wit forlon; And, for to passen harmles of that place, She graunted him; ther was non other grace. And therwith-al a costrel taketh he, And seyde, ‘herof a draught, or two or three, Yif him to drinke, whan he goth to reste, And he shal slepe as longe as ever thee leste, The narcotiks and opies been so stronge: And go thy wey, lest that him thinke longe.’ Out comth the bryd, and with ful sober chere, As is of maidens ofte the manere, To chambre is broght with revel and with songe, And shortly, lest this tale be to longe, This Lino and she ben sone broght to bedde; And every wight out at the dore him spedde. The night is wasted, and he fel a-slepe; Ful tenderly beginneth she to wepe. She rist her up, and dredfully she quaketh, As doth the braunche that Zephirus shaketh, And husht were alle in Argon that citee. As cold as any frost now wexeth she; For pite by the herte her streyneth so, And dreed of death doth her so moche wo, That thryes doun she fil in swiche a were. She rist her up, and stakereth heer and there, And on her handes faste loketh she. ‘Allas! and shul my handes blody be? I am a maid, and, as by my nature, And by my semblant and by my vesture, Myn handes been nat shapen for a knyf, As for to reve no man fro his lyf. What devil have I with the knyf to do? And shal I have my throte corve a-two? Than shal I blede, allas! and me beshende; And nedes cost this thing mot have an ende; Or he or I mot nedes lese our lyf. Now certes,’ quod she, ‘sin I am his wyf, And hath my feith, yit is it bet for me For to be deed in wyfly honestee Than be a traitour living in my shame. Be as be may, for ernest or for game, He shal awake, and ryse and go his way Out at this goter, or that hit be day!’— And weep ful tenderly upon his face, And in her armes gan him to embrace, And him she roggeth and awaketh softe; And at the window leep he fro the lofte Whan she hath warned him, and doon him bote. This Lino swifte was, and light of fote, And from his wyf he ran a ful good pas. This sely woman is so wayk, allas! And helples so, that, or that she fer wente, Her cruel fader dide her for to hente. Allas! Lino! why art thou so unkinde? Why ne haddest thou remembred in thy minde To taken her, and lad her forth with thee? For, whan she saw that goon awey was he, And that she mighte nat so faste go, Ne folwen him, she sette her doun right tho, Til she was caught and fetered in prisoun. This tale is seid for this conclusioun [Unfinished.]</field>

Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote, And bathed every veyne in swich licour, Of which vertu engendred is the flour; Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth Inspired hath in every holt and heeth The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne, And smale fowles maken melodye, That slepen al the night with open yë, (So priketh hem nature in hir corages): Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages (And palmers for to seken straunge strondes) To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes; And specially, from every shires ende Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende, The holy blisful martir for to seke, That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke. Bifel that, in that seson on a day, In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage To Caunterbury with ful devout corage, At night was come in-to that hostelrye Wel nyne and twenty in a companye, Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle, That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde; The chambres and the stables weren wyde, And wel we weren esed atte beste. And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste, So hadde I spoken with hem everichon, That I was of hir felawshipe anon, And made forward erly for to ryse, To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse. But natheles, whyl I have tyme and space, Er that I ferther in this tale pace, Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun, To telle yow al the condicioun Of ech of hem, so as it semed me, And whiche they weren, and of what degree; And eek in what array that they were inne: And at a knight than wol I first biginne. A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, Knight. That fro the tyme that he first bigan To ryden out, he loved chivalrye, Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye. Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre, And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre) As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse, And ever honoured for his worthinesse. At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne; Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce. In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce, No Cristen man so ofte of his degree. In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye. At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye, Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See At many a noble aryve hadde he be. At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene, And foughten for our feith at Tramissene In listes thryes, and ay slayn his foo. This ilke worthy knight had been also Somtyme with the lord of Palatye, Ageyn another hethen in Turkye: And evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys. And though that he were worthy, he was wys, And of his port as meke as is a mayde. He never yet no vileinye ne sayde In al his lyf, un-to no maner wight. He was a verray parfit gentil knight. But for to tellen yow of his array, His hors were gode, but he was nat gay. Of fustian he wered a gipoun Al bismotered with his habergeoun; For he was late y-come from his viage, And wente for to doon his pilgrimage. With him ther was his sone, a yong Squyer, Squyer. A lovyere, and a lusty bacheler, With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse. Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse. Of his stature he was of evene lengthe, And wonderly deliver, and greet of strengthe. And he had been somtyme in chivachye, In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye, And born him wel, as of so litel space, In hope to stonden in his lady grace. Embrouded was he, as it were a mede Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede. Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day; He was as fresh as is the month of May. Short was his goune, with sleves longe and wyde. Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ryde. He coude songes make and wel endyte, Iuste and eek daunce, and wel purtreye and wryte. So hote he lovede, that by nightertale He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale. Curteys he was, lowly, and servisable, And carf biforn his fader at the table. A Yeman hadde he, and servaunts namo Yeman. At that tyme, for him liste ryde so; And he was clad in cote and hood of grene; A sheef of pecok-arwes brighte and kene Under his belt he bar ful thriftily; (Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly: His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe), And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe. A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage. Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage. Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer, And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler, And on that other syde a gay daggere, Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere; A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene. An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene; A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse. Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse, Prioresse. That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy; Hir gretteste ooth was but by sëynt Loy; And she was cleped madame Eglentyne. Ful wel she song the service divyne, Entuned in hir nose ful semely; And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly, After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe, For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe. At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle; She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle, Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe. Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe, That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest. In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest. Hir over lippe wyped she so clene, That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte. Ful semely after hir mete she raughte, And sikerly she was of greet disport, And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port, And peyned hir to countrefete chere Of court, and been estatlich of manere, And to ben holden digne of reverence. But, for to speken of hir conscience, She was so charitable and so pitous, She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde. Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed. But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed, Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte: And al was conscience and tendre herte. Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was; Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas; Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed; But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed; It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe; For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe. Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war. Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene; And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene, On which ther was first write a crowned A, And after, Amor vincit omnia. Another Nonne with hir hadde she, Nonne. That was hir chapeleyne, and Preestes three. 3 Preestes. A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrye, Monk. An out-rydere, that lovede venerye; A manly man, to been an abbot able. Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable: And, whan he rood, men mighte his brydel here Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere, And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle, Ther as this lord was keper of the celle. The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit, By-cause that it was old and som-del streit, This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace, And held after the newe world the space. He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen, That seith, that hunters been nat holy men; Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees, Is lykned til a fish that is waterlees; This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre. But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre; And I seyde, his opinioun was good. What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood, Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure, Or swinken with his handes, and laboure, As Austin bit? How shal the world be served? Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved. Therfore he was a pricasour aright; Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight; Of priking and of hunting for the hare Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare. I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond; And, for to festne his hood under his chin, He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin: A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was. His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas, And eek his face, as he had been anoint. He was a lord ful fat and in good point; His eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed, That stemed as a forneys of a leed; His botes souple, his hors in greet estat. Now certeinly he was a fair prelat; He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost. A fat swan loved he best of any roost. His palfrey was as broun as is a berye. A Frere ther was, a wantown and a merye, Frere. A limitour, a ful solempne man. In alle the ordres foure is noon that can So muche of daliaunce and fair langage. He hadde maad ful many a mariage Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost. Un-to his ordre he was a noble post. Ful wel biloved and famulier was he With frankeleyns over-al in his contree, And eek with worthy wommen of the toun: For he had power of confessioun, As seyde him-self, more than a curat, For of his ordre he was licentiat. Ful swetely herde he confessioun, And plesaunt was his absolucioun; He was an esy man to yeve penaunce Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce; For unto a povre ordre for to yive Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive. For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt, He wiste that a man was repentaunt. For many a man so hard is of his herte, He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte. Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres, Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres. His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves. And certeinly he hadde a mery note; Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote. Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys. His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys; Ther-to he strong was as a champioun. He knew the tavernes wel in every toun, And everich hostiler and tappestere Bet than a lazar or a beggestere; For un-to swich a worthy man as he Acorded nat, as by his facultee, To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce. It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce For to delen with no swich poraille, But al with riche and sellers of vitaille. And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse, Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse. Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous. He was the beste beggere in his hous; [And yaf a certeyn ferme for the graunt; Noon of his bretheren cam ther in his haunt;] For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho, So plesaunt was his “In principio,” Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente. His purchas was wel bettre than his rente. And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe. In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe. For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer, With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler, But he was lyk a maister or a pope. Of double worsted was his semi-cope, That rounded as a belle out of the presse. Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse, To make his English swete up-on his tonge; And in his harping, whan that he had songe, His eyen twinkled in his heed aright, As doon the sterres in the frosty night. This worthy limitour was cleped Huberd. A Marchant was ther with a forked berd, Marchant. In mottelee, and hye on horse he sat, Up-on his heed a Flaundrish bever hat; His botes clasped faire and fetisly. His resons he spak ful solempnely, Souninge alway thencrees of his winning. He wolde the see were kept for any thing Bitwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle. Wel coude he in eschaunge sheeldes selle. This worthy man ful wel his wit bisette; Ther wiste no wight that he was in dette, So estatly was he of his governaunce, With his bargaynes, and with his chevisaunce. For sothe he was a worthy man with-alle, But sooth to seyn, I noot how men him calle. A Clerk ther was of Oxenford also, Clerk. That un-to logik hadde longe y-go. As lene was his hors as is a rake, And he nas nat right fat, I undertake; But loked holwe, and ther-to soberly. Ful thredbar was his overest courtepy; For he had geten him yet no benefyce, Ne was so worldly for to have offyce. For him was lever have at his beddes heed Twenty bokes, clad in blak or reed, Of Aristotle and his philosophye, Than robes riche, or fithele, or gay sautrye. But al be that he was a philosophre, Yet hadde he but litel gold in cofre; But al that he mighte of his freendes hente, On bokes and on lerninge he it spente, And bisily gan for the soules preye Of hem that yaf him wher-with to scoleye. Of studie took he most cure and most hede. Noght o word spak he more than was nede, And that was seyd in forme and reverence, And short and quik, and ful of hy sentence. Souninge in moral vertu was his speche, And gladly wolde he lerne, and gladly teche. A Sergeant of the Lawe, war and wys, Man of Lawe. That often hadde been at the parvys, Ther was also, ful riche of excellence. Discreet he was, and of greet reverence: He semed swich, his wordes weren so wyse. Iustyce he was ful often in assyse, By patente, and by pleyn commissioun; For his science, and for his heigh renoun Of fees and robes hadde he many oon. So greet a purchasour was no-wher noon. Al was fee simple to him in effect, His purchasing mighte nat been infect. No-wher so bisy a man as he ther nas, And yet he semed bisier than he was. In termes hadde he caas and domes alle, That from the tyme of king William were falle. Therto he coude endyte, and make a thing, Ther coude no wight pinche at his wryting; And every statut coude he pleyn by rote. He rood but hoomly in a medlee cote Girt with a ceint of silk, with barres smale; Of his array telle I no lenger tale. A Frankeleyn was in his companye; Frankeleyn. Whyt was his berd, as is the dayesye. Of his complexioun he was sangwyn. Wel loved he by the morwe a sop in wyn. To liven in delyt was ever his wone, For he was Epicurus owne sone, That heeld opinioun, that pleyn delyt Was verraily felicitee parfyt. An housholdere, and that a greet, was he; Seint Iulian he was in his contree. His breed, his ale, was alwey after oon; A bettre envyned man was no-wher noon. With-oute bake mete was never his hous, Of fish and flesh, and that so plentevous, It snewed in his hous of mete and drinke, Of alle deyntees that men coude thinke. After the sondry sesons of the yeer, So chaunged he his mete and his soper. Ful many a fat partrich hadde he in mewe, And many a breem and many a luce in stewe. Wo was his cook, but-if his sauce were Poynaunt and sharp, and redy al his gere. His table dormant in his halle alway Stood redy covered al the longe day. At sessiouns ther was he lord and sire; Ful ofte tyme he was knight of the shire. An anlas and a gipser al of silk Heng at his girdel, whyt as morne milk. A shirreve hadde he been, and a countour; Was no-wher such a worthy vavasour. An Haberdassher and a Carpenter, Haberdassher. Carpenter. A Webbe, a Dyere, and a Tapicer, Webbe. Dyere. Tapicer. Were with us eek, clothed in o liveree, Of a solempne and greet fraternitee. Ful fresh and newe hir gere apyked was; Hir knyves were y-chaped noght with bras, But al with silver, wroght ful clene and weel, Hir girdles and hir pouches every-deel. Wel semed ech of hem a fair burgeys, To sitten in a yeldhalle on a deys. Everich, for the wisdom that he can, Was shaply for to been an alderman. For catel hadde they y-nogh and rente, And eek hir wyves wolde it wel assente; And elles certein were they to blame. It is ful fair to been y-clept “ma dame,“ And goon to vigilyës al bifore, And have a mantel royalliche y-bore. A Cook they hadde with hem for the nones, Cook. To boille the chiknes with the mary-bones, And poudre-marchant tart, and galingale. Wel coude he knowe a draughte of London ale. He coude roste, and sethe, and broille, and frye, Maken mortreux, and wel bake a pye. But greet harm was it, as it thoughte me, That on his shine a mormal hadde he; For blankmanger, that made he with the beste. A Shipman was ther, woning fer by weste: Shipman. For aught I woot, he was of Dertemouthe. He rood up-on a rouncy, as he couthe, In a gowne of falding to the knee. A daggere hanging on a laas hadde he Aboute his nekke under his arm adoun. The hote somer had maad his hewe al broun; And, certeinly, he was a good felawe. Ful many a draughte of wyn had he y-drawe From Burdeux-ward, whyl that the chapman sleep. Of nyce conscience took he no keep. If that he faught, and hadde the hyer hond, By water he sente hem hoom to every lond. But of his craft to rekene wel his tydes, His stremes and his daungers him bisydes, His herberwe and his mone, his lodemenage, Ther nas noon swich from Hulle to Cartage. Hardy he was, and wys to undertake; With many a tempest hadde his berd been shake. He knew wel alle the havenes, as they were, From Gootlond to the cape of Finistere, And every cryke in Britayne and in Spayne; His barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne. With us ther was a Doctour of Phisyk, Doctour. In al this world ne was ther noon him lyk To speke of phisik and of surgerye; For he was grounded in astronomye. He kepte his pacient a ful greet del In houres, by his magik naturel. Wel coude he fortunen the ascendent Of his images for his pacient. He knew the cause of everich maladye, Were it of hoot or cold, or moiste, or drye, And where engendred, and of what humour; He was a verrey parfit practisour. The cause y-knowe, and of his harm the rote, Anon he yaf the seke man his bote. Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries, To sende him drogges and his letuaries, For ech of hem made other for to winne; Hir frendschipe nas nat newe to biginne. Wel knew he the olde Esculapius, And Deiscorides, and eek Rufus, Old Ypocras, Haly, and Galien; Serapion, Razis, and Avicen; Averrois, Damascien, and Constantyn; Bernard, and Gatesden, and Gilbertyn. Of his diete mesurable was he, For it was of no superfluitee, But of greet norissing and digestible. His studie was but litel on the Bible. In sangwin and in pers he clad was al, Lyned with taffata and with sendal; And yet he was but esy of dispence; He kepte that he wan in pestilence. For gold in phisik is a cordial, Therfore he lovede gold in special. A good Wyf was ther of bisyde Bathe, Wyf of Bathe. But she was som-del deef, and that was scathe. Of clooth-making she hadde swiche an haunt, She passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt. In al the parisshe wyf ne was ther noon That to the offring bifore hir sholde goon; And if ther dide, certeyn, so wrooth was she, That she was out of alle charitee. Hir coverchiefs ful fyne were of ground; I dorste swere they weyeden ten pound That on a Sonday were upon hir heed. Hir hosen weren of fyn scarlet reed, Ful streite y-teyd, and shoos ful moiste and newe. Bold was hir face, and fair, and reed of hewe. She was a worthy womman al hir lyve, Housbondes at chirche-dore she hadde fyve, Withouten other companye in youthe; But therof nedeth nat to speke as nouthe. And thryes hadde she been at Ierusalem; She hadde passed many a straunge streem; At Rome she hadde been, and at Boloigne, In Galice at seint Iame, and at Coloigne. She coude muche of wandring by the weye; Gat-tothed was she, soothly for to seye. Up-on an amblere esily she sat, Y-wimpled wel, and on hir heed an hat As brood as is a bokeler or a targe; A foot-mantel aboute hir hipes large, And on hir feet a paire of spores sharpe. In felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe. Of remedyes of love she knew per-chaunce, For she coude of that art the olde daunce. A good man was ther of religioun, And was a povre Persoun of a toun; Persoun. But riche he was of holy thoght and werk. He was also a lerned man, a clerk, That Cristes gospel trewely wolde preche; His parisshens devoutly wolde he teche. Benigne he was, and wonder diligent, And in adversitee ful pacient; And swich he was y-preved ofte sythes. Ful looth were him to cursen for his tythes, But rather wolde he yeven, out of doute, Un-to his povre parisshens aboute Of his offring, and eek of his substaunce. He coude in litel thing han suffisaunce. Wyd was his parisshe, and houses fer a-sonder, But he ne lafte nat, for reyn ne thonder, In siknes nor in meschief, to visyte The ferreste in his parisshe, muche and lyte, Up-on his feet, and in his hand a staf. This noble ensample to his sheep he yaf, That first he wroghte, and afterward he taughte; Out of the gospel he tho wordes caughte; And this figure he added eek ther-to, That if gold ruste, what shal iren do? For if a preest be foul, on whom we truste, No wonder is a lewed man to ruste; And shame it is, if a preest take keep, A shiten shepherde and a clene sheep. Wel oghte a preest ensample for to yive, By his clennesse, how that his sheep shold live. He sette nat his benefice to hyre, And leet his sheep encombred in the myre, And ran to London, un-to sëynt Poules, To seken him a chaunterie for soules, Or with a bretherhed to been withholde; But dwelte at hoom, and kepte wel his folde, So that the wolf ne made it nat miscarie; He was a shepherde and no mercenarie. And though he holy were, and vertuous, He was to sinful man nat despitous, Ne of his speche daungerous ne digne, But in his teching discreet and benigne. To drawen folk to heven by fairnesse By good ensample, was his bisinesse: But it were any persone obstinat, What-so he were, of heigh or lowe estat, Him wolde he snibben sharply for the nones. A bettre preest, I trowe that nowher noon is. He wayted after no pompe and reverence, Ne maked him a spyced conscience, But Cristes lore, and his apostles twelve, He taughte, and first he folwed it him-selve. With him ther was a Plowman, was his brother, Plowman. That hadde y-lad of dong ful many a fother, A trewe swinker and a good was he, Livinge in pees and parfit charitee. God loved he best with al his hole herte At alle tymes, thogh him gamed or smerte, And thanne his neighebour right as him-selve. He wolde thresshe, and ther-to dyke and delve, For Cristes sake, for every povre wight, Withouten hyre, if it lay in his might. His tythes payed he ful faire and wel, Bothe of his propre swink and his catel. In a tabard he rood upon a mere. Ther was also a Reve and a Millere, A Somnour and a Pardoner also, A Maunciple, and my-self; ther were namo. The Miller was a stout carl, for the nones, Miller. Ful big he was of braun, and eek of bones; That proved wel, for over-al ther he cam, At wrastling he wolde have alwey the ram. He was short-sholdred, brood, a thikke knarre, Ther nas no dore that he nolde heve of harre, Or breke it, at a renning, with his heed. His berd as any sowe or fox was reed, And ther-to brood, as though it were a spade. Up-on the cop right of his nose he hade A werte, and ther-on stood a tuft of heres, Reed as the bristles of a sowes eres; His nose-thirles blake were and wyde. A swerd and bokeler bar he by his syde; His mouth as greet was as a greet forneys. He was a Ianglere and a goliardeys, And that was most of sinne and harlotryes. Wel coude he stelen corn, and tollen thryes; And yet he hadde a thombe of gold, pardee. A whyt cote and a blew hood wered he. A baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne, And ther-with-al he broghte us out of towne. A gentil Maunciple was ther of a temple, Maunciple. Of which achatours mighte take exemple For to be wyse in bying of vitaille. For whether that he payde, or took by taille, Algate he wayted so in his achat, That he was ay biforn and in good stat. Now is nat that of God a ful fair grace, That swich a lewed mannes wit shal pace The wisdom of an heep of lerned men? Of maistres hadde he mo than thryes ten, That were of lawe expert and curious; Of which ther were a doseyn in that hous, Worthy to been stiwardes of rente and lond Of any lord that is in Engelond, To make him live by his propre good, In honour dettelees, but he were wood, Or live as scarsly as him list desire; And able for to helpen al a shire In any cas that mighte falle or happe; And yit this maunciple sette hir aller cappe. The Reve was a sclendre colerik man, Reve. His berd was shave as ny as ever he can. His heer was by his eres round y-shorn. His top was dokked lyk a preest biforn. Ful longe were his legges, and ful lene, Y-lyk a staf, ther was no calf y-sene. Wel coude he kepe a gerner and a binne; Ther was noon auditour coude on him winne. Wel wiste he, by the droghte, and by the reyn, The yelding of his seed, and of his greyn. His lordes sheep, his neet, his dayerye, His swyn, his hors, his stoor, and his pultrye, Was hoolly in this reves governing, And by his covenaunt yaf the rekening, Sin that his lord was twenty yeer of age; Ther coude no man bringe him in arrerage. Ther nas baillif, ne herde, ne other hyne, That he ne knew his sleighte and his covyne; They were adrad of him, as of the deeth. His woning was ful fair up-on an heeth, With grene treës shadwed was his place. He coude bettre than his lord purchace. Ful riche he was astored prively, His lord wel coude he plesen subtilly, To yeve and lene him of his owne good, And have a thank, and yet a cote and hood. In youthe he lerned hadde a good mister; He was a wel good wrighte, a carpenter. This reve sat up-on a ful good stot, That was al pomely grey, and highte Scot. A long surcote of pers up-on he hade, And by his syde he bar a rusty blade. Of Northfolk was this reve, of which I telle, Bisyde a toun men clepen Baldeswelle. Tukked he was, as is a frere, aboute, And ever he rood the hindreste of our route. A Somnour was ther with us in that place, Somnour. That hadde a fyr-reed cherubinnes face, For sawcefleem he was, with eyen narwe. As hoot he was, and lecherous, as a sparwe; With scalled browes blake, and piled berd; Of his visage children were aferd. Ther nas quik-silver, litarge, ne brimstoon, Boras, ceruce, ne oille of tartre noon, Ne oynement that wolde clense and byte, That him mighte helpen of his whelkes whyte, Nor of the knobbes sittinge on his chekes. Wel loved he garleek, oynons, and eek lekes, And for to drinken strong wyn, reed as blood. Thanne wolde he speke, and crye as he were wood. And whan that he wel dronken hadde the wyn, Than wolde he speke no word but Latyn. A fewe termes hadde he, two or three, That he had lerned out of som decree; No wonder is, he herde it al the day; And eek ye knowen wel, how that a Iay Can clepen ‘Watte,’ as well as can the pope. But who-so coude in other thing him grope, Thanne hadde he spent al his philosophye; Ay ‘Questio quid iuris’ wolde he crye. He was a gentil harlot and a kinde; A bettre felawe sholde men noght finde. He wolde suffre, for a quart of wyn, A good felawe to have his concubyn A twelf-month, and excuse him atte fulle: Ful prively a finch eek coude he pulle. And if he fond o-wher a good felawe, He wolde techen him to have non awe, In swich cas, of the erchedeknes curs, But-if a mannes soule were in his purs; For in his purs he sholde y-punisshed be. ‘Purs is the erchedeknes helle,’ seyde he. But wel I woot he lyed right in dede; Of cursing oghte ech gilty man him drede— For curs wol slee, right as assoilling saveth— And also war him of a significavit. In daunger hadde he at his owne gyse The yonge girles of the diocyse, And knew hir counseil, and was al hir reed. A gerland hadde he set up-on his heed, As greet as it were for an ale-stake; A bokeler hadde he maad him of a cake. With him ther rood a gentil Pardoner Pardoner. Of Rouncival, his freend and his compeer, That streight was comen fro the court of Rome. Ful loude he song, ‘Com hider, love, to me.’ This somnour bar to him a stif burdoun, Was never trompe of half so greet a soun. This pardoner hadde heer as yelow as wex, But smothe it heng, as dooth a strike of flex; By ounces henge his lokkes that he hadde, And ther-with he his shuldres overspradde; But thinne it lay, by colpons oon and oon; But hood, for Iolitee, ne wered he noon, For it was trussed up in his walet. Him thoughte, he rood al of the newe Iet; Dischevele, save his cappe, he rood al bare. Swiche glaringe eyen hadde he as an hare. A vernicle hadde he sowed on his cappe. His walet lay biforn him in his lappe, Bret-ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot. A voys he hadde as smal as hath a goot. No berd hadde he, ne never sholde have, As smothe it was as it were late y-shave; I trowe he were a gelding or a mare. But of his craft, fro Berwik into Ware, Ne was ther swich another pardoner. For in his male he hadde a pilwe-beer, Which that, he seyde, was our lady veyl: He seyde, he hadde a gobet of the seyl That sëynt Peter hadde, whan that he wente Up-on the see, til Iesu Crist him hente. He hadde a croys of latoun, ful of stones, And in a glas he hadde pigges bones. But with thise relikes, whan that he fond A povre person dwelling up-on lond, Up-on a day he gat him more moneye Than that the person gat in monthes tweye. And thus, with feyned flaterye and Iapes, He made the person and the peple his apes. But trewely to tellen, atte laste, He was in chirche a noble ecclesiaste. Wel coude he rede a lessoun or a storie, But alderbest he song an offertorie; For wel he wiste, whan that song was songe, He moste preche, and wel affyle his tonge, To winne silver, as he ful wel coude; Therefore he song so meriely and loude. Now have I told you shortly, in a clause, Thestat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause Why that assembled was this companye In Southwerk, at this gentil hostelrye, That highte the Tabard, faste by the Belle. But now is tyme to yow for to telle How that we baren us that ilke night, Whan we were in that hostelrye alight. And after wol I telle of our viage, And al the remenaunt of our pilgrimage. But first I pray yow, of your curteisye, That ye narette it nat my vileinye, Thogh that I pleynly speke in this matere, To telle yow hir wordes and hir chere; Ne thogh I speke hir wordes properly. For this ye knowen al-so wel as I, Who-so shal telle a tale after a man, He moot reherce, as ny as ever he can, Everich a word, if it be in his charge, Al speke he never so rudeliche and large; Or elles he moot telle his tale untrewe, Or feyne thing, or finde wordes newe. He may nat spare, al-thogh he were his brother; He moot as wel seye o word as another. Crist spak him-self ful brode in holy writ, And wel ye woot, no vileinye is it. Eek Plato seith, who-so that can him rede, The wordes mote be cosin to the dede. Also I prey yow to foryeve it me, Al have I nat set folk in hir degree Here in this tale, as that they sholde stonde; My wit is short, ye may wel understonde. Greet chere made our hoste us everichon, And to the soper sette he us anon; And served us with vitaille at the beste. Strong was the wyn, and wel to drinke us leste. A semely man our hoste was with-alle For to han been a marshal in an halle; A large man he was with eyen stepe, A fairer burgeys is ther noon in Chepe: Bold of his speche, and wys, and wel y-taught, And of manhod him lakkede right naught. Eek therto he was right a mery man, And after soper pleyen he bigan, And spak of mirthe amonges othere thinges, Whan that we hadde maad our rekeninges; And seyde thus: ‘Now, lordinges, trewely, Ye been to me right welcome hertely: For by my trouthe, if that I shal nat lye, I ne saugh this yeer so mery a companye At ones in this herberwe as is now. Fayn wolde I doon yow mirthe, wiste I how. And of a mirthe I am right now bithoght, To doon yow ese, and it shal coste noght. Ye goon to Caunterbury; God yow spede, The blisful martir quyte yow your mede. And wel I woot, as ye goon by the weye, Ye shapen yow to talen and to pleye; For trewely, confort ne mirthe is noon To ryde by the weye doumb as a stoon; And therfore wol I maken yow disport, As I seyde erst, and doon yow som confort. And if yow lyketh alle, by oon assent, Now for to stonden at my Iugement, And for to werken as I shal yow seye, To-morwe, whan ye ryden by the weye, Now, by my fader soule, that is deed, But ye be merye, I wol yeve yow myn heed. Hold up your hond, withouten more speche.’ Our counseil was nat longe for to seche; Us thoughte it was noght worth to make it wys, And graunted him withouten more avys, And bad him seye his verdit, as him leste. ‘Lordinges,’ quod he, ‘now herkneth for the beste; But tak it not, I prey yow, in desdeyn; This is the poynt, to speken short and pleyn, That ech of yow, to shorte with your weye, In this viage, shal telle tales tweye, To Caunterbury-ward, I mene it so, And hom-ward he shal tellen othere two, Of aventures that whylom han bifalle. And which of yow that bereth him best of alle, That is to seyn, that telleth in this cas Tales of best sentence and most solas, Shal have a soper at our aller cost Here in this place, sitting by this post, Whan that we come agayn fro Caunterbury. And for to make yow the more mery, I wol my-selven gladly with yow ryde, Right at myn owne cost, and be your gyde. And who-so wol my Iugement withseye Shal paye al that we spenden by the weye. And if ye vouche-sauf that it be so, Tel me anon, with-outen wordes mo, And I wol erly shape me therfore.’ This thing was graunted, and our othes swore With ful glad herte, and preyden him also That he wold vouche-sauf for to do so, And that he wolde been our governour, And of our tales Iuge and reportour, And sette a soper at a certeyn prys; And we wold reuled been at his devys, In heigh and lowe; and thus, by oon assent, We been acorded to his Iugement. And ther-up-on the wyn was fet anon; We dronken, and to reste wente echon, With-outen any lenger taryinge. A-morwe, whan that day bigan to springe, Up roos our host, and was our aller cok, And gadrede us togidre, alle in a flok, And forth we riden, a litel more than pas, Un-to the watering of seint Thomas. And there our host bigan his hors areste, And seyde; ‘Lordinges, herkneth, if yow leste. Ye woot your forward, and I it yow recorde. If even-song and morwe-song acorde, Lat se now who shal telle the firste tale. As ever mote I drinke wyn or ale, Who-so be rebel to my Iugement Shal paye for al that by the weye is spent. Now draweth cut, er that we ferrer twinne; He which that hath the shortest shal beginne. Sire knight,’ quod he, ‘my maister and my lord, Now draweth cut, for that is myn acord. Cometh neer,’ quod he, ‘my lady prioresse; And ye, sir clerk, lat be your shamfastnesse, Ne studieth noght; ley hond to, every man.’ Anon to drawen every wight bigan, And shortly for to tellen, as it was, Were it by aventure, or sort, or cas, The sothe is this, the cut fil to the knight, Of which ful blythe and glad was every wight; And telle he moste his tale, as was resoun, By forward and by composicioun, As ye han herd; what nedeth wordes mo? And whan this gode man saugh it was so, As he that wys was and obedient To kepe his forward by his free assent, He seyde: ‘Sin I shal biginne the game, What, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name! Now lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye.’ And with that word we riden forth our weye; And he bigan with right a mery chere His tale anon, and seyde in this manere. Here endeth the prolog of this book; and here biginneth the first tale, which is the Knightes Tale. THE KNIGHTES TALE. Iamque domos patrias, Scithice post aspera gentis Prelia, laurigero, &amp;c. [Statius, Theb. xii. 519.] Whylom, as olde stories tellen us, Ther was a duk that highte Theseus; Of Athenes he was lord and governour, And in his tyme swich a conquerour, That gretter was ther noon under the sonne. Ful many a riche contree hadde he wonne; What with his wisdom and his chivalrye, He conquered al the regne of Femenye, That whylom was y-cleped Scithia; And weddede the quene Ipolita, And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree With muchel glorie and greet solempnitee, And eek hir yonge suster Emelye. And thus with victorie and with melodye Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde, And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde. And certes, if it nere to long to here, I wolde han told yow fully the manere, How wonnen was the regne of Femenye By Theseus, and by his chivalrye; And of the grete bataille for the nones Bitwixen Athenës and Amazones; And how asseged was Ipolita, The faire hardy quene of Scithia; And of the feste that was at hir weddinge, And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge; But al that thing I moot as now forbere. I have, God woot, a large feeld to ere, And wayke been the oxen in my plough. The remenant of the tale is long y-nough. I wol nat letten eek noon of this route; Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute, And lat see now who shal the soper winne; And ther I lefte, I wol ageyn biginne. This duk, of whom I make mencioun, When he was come almost unto the toun, In al his wele and in his moste pryde, He was war, as he caste his eye asyde, Wher that ther kneled in the hye weye A companye of ladies, tweye and tweye, Ech after other, clad in clothes blake; But swich a cry and swich a wo they make, That in this world nis creature livinge, That herde swich another weymentinge; And of this cry they nolde never stenten, Til they the reynes of his brydel henten. ‘What folk ben ye, that at myn hoom-cominge Perturben so my feste with cryinge?’ Quod Theseus, ‘have ye so greet envye Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye? Or who hath yow misboden, or offended? And telleth me if it may been amended; And why that ye ben clothed thus in blak?’ The eldest lady of hem alle spak, When she hadde swowned with a deedly chere, That it was routhe for to seen and here, And seyde: ‘Lord, to whom Fortune hath yiven Victorie, and as a conquerour to liven, Noght greveth us your glorie and your honour; But we biseken mercy and socour. Have mercy on our wo and our distresse. Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy gentillesse, Up-on us wrecched wommen lat thou falle. For certes, lord, ther nis noon of us alle, That she nath been a duchesse or a quene; Now be we caitifs, as it is wel sene: Thanked be Fortune, and hir false wheel, That noon estat assureth to be weel. And certes, lord, to abyden your presence, Here in the temple of the goddesse Clemence We han ben waytinge al this fourtenight; Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy might. I wrecche, which that wepe and waille thus, Was whylom wyf to king Capaneus, That starf at Thebes, cursed be that day! And alle we, that been in this array, And maken al this lamentacioun, We losten alle our housbondes at that toun, Whyl that the sege ther-aboute lay. And yet now the olde Creon, weylaway! That lord is now of Thebes the citee, Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee, He, for despyt, and for his tirannye, To do the dede bodyes vileinye, Of alle our lordes, whiche that ben slawe, Hath alle the bodyes on an heep y-drawe, And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent, Neither to been y-buried nor y-brent, But maketh houndes ete hem in despyt.’ And with that word, with-outen more respyt, They fillen gruf, and cryden pitously, ‘Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy, And lat our sorwe sinken in thyn herte.’ This gentil duk doun from his courser sterte With herte pitous, whan he herde hem speke. Him thoughte that his herte wolde breke, Whan he saugh hem so pitous and so mat, That whylom weren of so greet estat. And in his armes he hem alle up hente, And hem conforteth in ful good entente; And swoor his ooth, as he was trewe knight, He wolde doon so ferforthly his might Up-on the tyraunt Creon hem to wreke, That al the peple of Grece sholde speke How Creon was of Theseus y-served, As he that hadde his deeth ful wel deserved. And right anoon, with-outen more abood, His baner he desplayeth, and forth rood To Thebes-ward, and al his host bisyde; No neer Athenës wolde he go ne ryde, Ne take his ese fully half a day, But onward on his wey that night he lay; And sente anoon Ipolita the quene, And Emelye hir yonge suster shene, Un-to the toun of Athenës to dwelle; And forth he rit; ther nis namore to telle. The rede statue of Mars, with spere and targe, So shyneth in his whyte baner large, That alle the feeldes gliteren up and doun; And by his baner born is his penoun Of gold ful riche, in which ther was y-bete The Minotaur, which that he slough in Crete. Thus rit this duk, thus rit this conquerour, And in his host of chivalrye the flour, Til that he cam to Thebes, and alighte Faire in a feeld, ther as he thoghte fighte. But shortly for to speken of this thing, With Creon, which that was of Thebes king, He faught, and slough him manly as a knight In pleyn bataille, and putte the folk to flight; And by assaut he wan the citee after, And rente adoun bothe wal, and sparre, and rafter; And to the ladyes he restored agayn The bones of hir housbondes that were slayn, To doon obsequies, as was tho the gyse. But it were al to long for to devyse The grete clamour and the waymentinge That the ladyes made at the brenninge Of the bodyes, and the grete honour That Theseus, the noble conquerour, Doth to the ladyes, whan they from him wente; But shortly for to telle is myn entente. Whan that this worthy duk, this Theseus, Hath Creon slayn, and wonne Thebes thus, Stille in that feeld he took al night his reste, And dide with al the contree as him leste. To ransake in the tas of bodyes dede, Hem for to strepe of harneys and of wede, The pilours diden bisinesse and cure, After the bataille and disconfiture. And so bifel, that in the tas they founde, Thurgh-girt with many a grevous blody wounde, Two yonge knightes ligging by and by, Bothe in oon armes, wroght ful richely, Of whiche two, Arcita hight that oon, And that other knight hight Palamon. Nat fully quike, ne fully dede they were, But by hir cote-armures, and by hir gere, The heraudes knewe hem best in special, As they that weren of the blood royal Of Thebes, and of sustren two y-born. Out of the tas the pilours han hem torn, And han hem caried softe un-to the tente Of Theseus, and he ful sone hem sente To Athenës, to dwellen in prisoun Perpetuelly, he nolde no raunsoun. And whan this worthy duk hath thus y-don, He took his host, and hoom he rood anon With laurer crowned as a conquerour; And there he liveth, in Ioye and in honour, Terme of his lyf; what nedeth wordes mo? And in a tour, in angwish and in wo, Dwellen this Palamoun and eek Arcite, For evermore, ther may no gold hem quyte. This passeth yeer by yeer, and day by day, Til it fil ones, in a morwe of May, That Emelye, that fairer was to sene Than is the lilie upon his stalke grene, And fressher than the May with floures newe— For with the rose colour stroof hir hewe, I noot which was the fairer of hem two— Er it were day, as was hir wone to do, She was arisen, and al redy dight; For May wol have no slogardye a-night. The sesoun priketh every gentil herte, And maketh him out of his sleep to sterte, And seith, ‘Arys, and do thyn observaunce.’ This maked Emelye have remembraunce To doon honour to May, and for to ryse. Y-clothed was she fresh, for to devyse; Hir yelow heer was broyded in a tresse, Bihinde hir bak, a yerde long, I gesse. And in the gardin, at the sonne up-riste, She walketh up and doun, and as hir liste She gadereth floures, party whyte and rede, To make a sotil gerland for hir hede, And as an aungel hevenly she song. The grete tour, that was so thikke and strong, Which of the castel was the chief dongeoun, (Ther-as the knightes weren in prisoun, Of whiche I tolde yow, and tellen shal) Was evene Ioynant to the gardin-wal, Ther as this Emelye hadde hir pleyinge. Bright was the sonne, and cleer that morweninge, And Palamon, this woful prisoner, As was his wone, by leve of his gayler, Was risen, and romed in a chambre on heigh, In which he al the noble citee seigh, And eek the gardin, ful of braunches grene, Ther-as this fresshe Emelye the shene Was in hir walk, and romed up and doun. This sorweful prisoner, this Palamoun, Goth in the chambre, roming to and fro, And to him-self compleyning of his wo; That he was born, ful ofte he seyde, ‘alas!’ And so bifel, by aventure or cas, That thurgh a window, thikke of many a barre Of yren greet, and square as any sparre, He caste his eye upon Emelya, And ther-with-al he bleynte, and cryde ‘a!’ As though he stongen were un-to the herte. And with that cry Arcite anon up-sterte, And seyde, ‘Cosin myn, what eyleth thee, That art so pale and deedly on to see? Why crydestow? who hath thee doon offence? For Goddes love, tak al in pacience Our prisoun, for it may non other be; Fortune hath yeven us this adversitee. Som wikke aspect or disposicioun Of Saturne, by sum constellacioun, Hath yeven us this, al-though we hadde it sworn; So stood the heven whan that we were born; We moste endure it: this is the short and pleyn.’ This Palamon answerde, and seyde ageyn, ‘Cosyn, for sothe, of this opinioun Thou hast a veyn imaginacioun. This prison caused me nat for to crye. But I was hurt right now thurgh-out myn yë In-to myn herte, that wol my bane be. The fairnesse of that lady that I see Yond in the gardin romen to and fro, Is cause of al my crying and my wo. I noot wher she be womman or goddesse; But Venus is it, soothly, as I gesse.’ And ther-with-al on kneës doun he fil, And seyde: ‘Venus, if it be thy wil Yow in this gardin thus to transfigure Bifore me, sorweful wrecche creature, Out of this prisoun help that we may scapen. And if so be my destinee be shapen By eterne word to dyen in prisoun, Of our linage have som compassioun, That is so lowe y-broght by tirannye.’ And with that word Arcite gan espye Wher-as this lady romed to and fro. And with that sighte hir beautee hurte him so, That, if that Palamon was wounded sore, Arcite is hurt as muche as he, or more. And with a sigh he seyde pitously: ‘The fresshe beautee sleeth me sodeynly Of hir that rometh in the yonder place; And, but I have hir mercy and hir grace, That I may seen hir atte leeste weye, I nam but deed; ther nis namore to seye.’ This Palamon, whan he tho wordes herde, Dispitously he loked, and answerde: ‘Whether seistow this in ernest or in pley?’ ‘Nay,’ quod Arcite, ‘in ernest, by my fey! God help me so, me list ful yvele pleye.’ This Palamon gan knitte his browes tweye: ‘It nere,’ quod he, ‘to thee no greet honour For to be fals, ne for to be traytour To me, that am thy cosin and thy brother Y-sworn ful depe, and ech of us til other, That never, for to dyen in the peyne, Til that the deeth departe shal us tweyne, Neither of us in love to hindren other, Ne in non other cas, my leve brother; But that thou sholdest trewely forthren me In every cas, and I shal forthren thee. This was thyn ooth, and myn also, certeyn; I wot right wel, thou darst it nat withseyn. Thus artow of my counseil, out of doute. And now thou woldest falsly been aboute To love my lady, whom I love and serve, And ever shal, til that myn herte sterve. Now certes, fals Arcite, thou shalt nat so. I loved hir first, and tolde thee my wo As to my counseil, and my brother sworn To forthre me, as I have told biforn. For which thou art y-bounden as a knight To helpen me, if it lay in thy might, Or elles artow fals, I dar wel seyn.’ This Arcitë ful proudly spak ageyn, ‘Thou shalt,’ quod he, ‘be rather fals than I; But thou art fals, I telle thee utterly; For par amour I loved hir first er thow. What wiltow seyn? thou wistest nat yet now Whether she be a womman or goddesse! Thyn is affeccioun of holinesse, And myn is love, as to a creature; For which I tolde thee myn aventure As to my cosin, and my brother sworn. I pose, that thou lovedest hir biforn; Wostow nat wel the olde clerkes sawe, That ‘who shal yeve a lover any lawe?’ Love is a gretter lawe, by my pan, Than may be yeve to any erthly man. And therefore positif lawe and swich decree Is broke al-day for love, in ech degree. A man moot nedes love, maugree his heed. He may nat fleen it, thogh he sholde be deed, Al be she mayde, or widwe, or elles wyf. And eek it is nat lykly, al thy lyf, To stonden in hir grace; namore shal I; For wel thou woost thy-selven, verraily, That thou and I be dampned to prisoun Perpetuelly; us gayneth no raunsoun. We stryve as dide the houndes for the boon, They foughte al day, and yet hir part was noon; Ther cam a kyte, whyl that they were wrothe, And bar awey the boon bitwixe hem bothe. And therfore, at the kinges court, my brother, Ech man for him-self, ther is non other. Love if thee list; for I love and ay shal; And soothly, leve brother, this is al. Here in this prisoun mote we endure, And everich of us take his aventure.’ Greet was the stryf and long bitwixe hem tweye, If that I hadde leyser for to seye; But to theffect. It happed on a day, (To telle it yow as shortly as I may) A worthy duk that highte Perotheus, That felawe was un-to duk Theseus Sin thilke day that they were children lyte, Was come to Athenes, his felawe to visyte, And for to pleye, as he was wont to do, For in this world he loved no man so: And he loved him as tendrely ageyn. So wel they loved, as olde bokes seyn, That whan that oon was deed, sothly to telle, His felawe wente and soghte him doun in helle; But of that story list me nat to wryte. Duk Perotheus loved wel Arcite, And hadde him knowe at Thebes yeer by yere; And fynally, at requeste and preyere Of Perotheus, with-oute any raunsoun, Duk Theseus him leet out of prisoun, Freely to goon, wher that him liste over-al, In swich a gyse, as I you tellen shal. This was the forward, pleynly for tendyte, Bitwixen Theseus and him Arcite: That if so were, that Arcite were y-founde Ever in his lyf, by day or night or stounde In any contree of this Theseus, And he were caught, it was acorded thus, That with a swerd he sholde lese his heed; Ther nas non other remedye ne reed, But taketh his leve, and homward he him spedde; Let him be war, his nekke lyth to wedde! How greet a sorwe suffreth now Arcite! The deeth he feleth thurgh his herte smyte; He wepeth, wayleth, cryeth pitously; To sleen him-self he wayteth prively. He seyde, ‘Allas that day that I was born! Now is my prison worse than biforn; Now is me shape eternally to dwelle Noght in purgatorie, but in helle. Allas! that ever knew I Perotheus! For elles hadde I dwelled with Theseus Y-fetered in his prisoun ever-mo. Than hadde I been in blisse, and nat in wo. Only the sighte of hir, whom that I serve, Though that I never hir grace may deserve, Wolde han suffised right y-nough for me. O dere cosin Palamon,’ quod he, ‘Thyn is the victorie of this aventure, Ful blisfully in prison maistow dure; In prison? certes nay, but in paradys! Wel hath fortune y-turned thee the dys, That hast the sighte of hir, and I thabsence. For possible is, sin thou hast hir presence, And art a knight, a worthy and an able, That by som cas, sin fortune is chaungeable, Thou mayst to thy desyr som-tyme atteyne. But I, that am exyled, and bareyne Of alle grace, and in so greet despeir, That ther nis erthe, water, fyr, ne eir, Ne creature, that of hem maked is, That may me helpe or doon confort in this. Wel oughte I sterve in wanhope and distresse; Farwel my lyf, my lust, and my gladnesse! Allas, why pleynen folk so in commune Of purveyaunce of God, or of fortune, That yeveth hem ful ofte in many a gyse Wel bettre than they can hem-self devyse? Som man desyreth for to han richesse, That cause is of his mordre or greet siknesse. And som man wolde out of his prison fayn, That in his hous is of his meynee slayn. Infinite harmes been in this matere; We witen nat what thing we preyen here. We faren as he that dronke is as a mous; A dronke man wot wel he hath an hous, But he noot which the righte wey is thider; And to a dronke man the wey is slider. And certes, in this world so faren we; We seken faste after felicitee, But we goon wrong ful often, trewely. Thus may we seyen alle, and namely I, That wende and hadde a greet opinioun, That, if I mighte escapen from prisoun, Than hadde I been in Ioye and perfit hele, Ther now I am exyled fro my wele. Sin that I may nat seen yow, Emelye, I nam but deed; ther nis no remedye.’ Up-on that other syde Palamon, Whan that he wiste Arcite was agon, Swich sorwe he maketh, that the grete tour Resouneth of his youling and clamour. The pure fettres on his shines grete Weren of his bittre salte teres wete. ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘Arcita, cosin myn, Of al our stryf, God woot, the fruyt is thyn. Thow walkest now in Thebes at thy large, And of my wo thou yevest litel charge. Thou mayst, sin thou hast wisdom and manhede, Assemblen alle the folk of our kinrede, And make a werre so sharp on this citee, That by som aventure, or som tretee, Thou mayst have hir to lady and to wyf, For whom that I mot nedes lese my lyf. For, as by wey of possibilitee, Sith thou art at thy large, of prison free, And art a lord, greet is thyn avauntage, More than is myn, that sterve here in a cage. For I mot wepe and wayle, whyl I live, With al the wo that prison may me yive, And eek with peyne that love me yiveth also, That doubleth al my torment and my wo.’ Ther-with the fyr of Ielousye up-sterte With-inne his brest, and hente him by the herte So woodly, that he lyk was to biholde The box-tree, or the asshen dede and colde. Tho seyde he; ‘O cruel goddes, that governe This world with binding of your word eterne, And wryten in the table of athamaunt Your parlement, and your eterne graunt, What is mankinde more un-to yow holde Than is the sheep, that rouketh in the folde? For slayn is man right as another beste, And dwelleth eek in prison and areste, And hath siknesse, and greet adversitee, And ofte tymes giltelees, pardee! What governaunce is in this prescience, That giltelees tormenteth innocence? And yet encreseth this al my penaunce, That man is bounden to his observaunce, For Goddes sake, to letten of his wille, Ther as a beest may al his lust fulfille. And whan a beest is deed, he hath no peyne; But man after his deeth moot wepe and pleyne, Though in this world he have care and wo: With-outen doute it may stonden so. The answere of this I lete to divynis, But wel I woot, that in this world gret pyne is. Allas! I see a serpent or a theef, That many a trewe man hath doon mescheef, Goon at his large, and wher him list may turne. But I mot been in prison thurgh Saturne, And eek thurgh Iuno, Ialous and eek wood, That hath destroyed wel ny al the blood Of Thebes, with his waste walles wyde. And Venus sleeth me on that other syde For Ielousye, and fere of him Arcite.’ Now wol I stinte of Palamon a lyte, And lete him in his prison stille dwelle, And of Arcita forth I wol yow telle. The somer passeth, and the nightes longe Encresen double wyse the peynes stronge Bothe of the lovere and the prisoner. I noot which hath the wofullere mester. For shortly for to seyn, this Palamoun Perpetuelly is dampned to prisoun, In cheynes and in fettres to ben deed; And Arcite is exyled upon his heed For ever-mo as out of that contree, Ne never-mo he shal his lady see. Yow loveres axe I now this questioun, Who hath the worse, Arcite or Palamoun? That oon may seen his lady day by day, But in prison he moot dwelle alway. That other wher him list may ryde or go, But seen his lady shal he never-mo. Now demeth as yow liste, ye that can, For I wol telle forth as I bigan. Explicit prima Pars. Sequitur pars secunda. Whan that Arcite to Thebes comen was, Ful ofte a day he swelte and seyde ‘allas,’ For seen his lady shal he never-mo. And shortly to concluden al his wo, So muche sorwe had never creature That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure. His sleep, his mete, his drink is him biraft, That lene he wex, and drye as is a shaft. His eyen holwe, and grisly to biholde; His hewe falwe, and pale as asshen colde, And solitarie he was, and ever allone, And wailling al the night, making his mone. And if he herde song or instrument, Then wolde he wepe, he mighte nat be stent; So feble eek were his spirits, and so lowe, And chaunged so, that no man coude knowe His speche nor his vois, though men it herde. And in his gere, for al the world he ferde Nat oonly lyk the loveres maladye Of Hereos, but rather lyk manye Engendred of humour malencolyk, Biforen, in his celle fantastyk. And shortly, turned was al up-so-doun Bothe habit and eek disposicioun Of him, this woful lovere daun Arcite. What sholde I al-day of his wo endyte? Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two This cruel torment, and this peyne and wo, At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde, Up-on a night, in sleep as he him leyde, Him thoughte how that the winged god Mercurie Biforn him stood, and bad him to be murye. His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte; An hat he werede up-on his heres brighte. Arrayed was this god (as he took keep) As he was whan that Argus took his sleep; And seyde him thus: ‘To Athenes shaltou wende; Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.’ And with that word Arcite wook and sterte. ‘Now trewely, how sore that me smerte,’ Quod he, ‘to Athenes right now wol I fare; Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare To see my lady, that I love and serve; In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.’ And with that word he caughte a greet mirour, And saugh that chaunged was al his colour, And saugh his visage al in another kinde. And right anoon it ran him in his minde, That, sith his face was so disfigured Of maladye, the which he hadde endured, He mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe, Live in Athenes ever-more unknowe, And seen his lady wel ny day by day. And right anon he chaunged his array, And cladde him as a povre laborer, And al allone, save oonly a squyer, That knew his privetee and al his cas, Which was disgysed povrely, as he was, To Athenes is he goon the nexte way. And to the court he wente up-on a day, And at the gate he profreth his servyse, To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse. And shortly of this matere for to seyn, He fil in office with a chamberleyn, The which that dwelling was with Emelye. For he was wys, and coude soon aspye Of every servaunt, which that serveth here. Wel coude he hewen wode, and water bere, For he was yong and mighty for the nones, And ther-to he was strong and big of bones To doon that any wight can him devyse. A yeer or two he was in this servyse, Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte; And ‘Philostrate’ he seide that he highte. But half so wel biloved a man as he Ne was ther never in court, of his degree; He was so gentil of condicioun, That thurghout al the court was his renoun. They seyden, that it were a charitee That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree, And putten him in worshipful servyse, Ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse. And thus, with-inne a whyle, his name is spronge Bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge, That Theseus hath taken him so neer That of his chambre he made him a squyer, And yaf him gold to mayntene his degree; And eek men broghte him out of his contree From yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente; But honestly and slyly he it spente, That no man wondred how that he it hadde. And three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde, And bar him so in pees and eek in werre, Ther nas no man that Theseus hath derre. And in this blisse lete I now Arcite, And speke I wol of Palamon a lyte. In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun This seven yeer hath seten Palamoun, Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse; Who feleth double soor and hevinesse But Palamon? that love destreyneth so, That wood out of his wit he gooth for wo; And eek therto he is a prisoner Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yeer. Who coude ryme in English proprely His martirdom? for sothe, it am nat I; Therefore I passe as lightly as I may. It fel that in the seventhe yeer, in May, The thridde night, (as olde bokes seyn, That al this storie tellen more pleyn,) Were it by aventure or destinee, (As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,) That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun, By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun, And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go; For he had yive his gayler drinke so Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn, With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn, That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake, The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake; And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may. The night was short, and faste by the day, That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde, And til a grove, faste ther besyde, With dredful foot than stalketh Palamoun. For shortly, this was his opinioun, That in that grove he wolde him hyde al day, And in the night than wolde he take his way To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye On Theseus to helpe him to werreye; And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lyf, Or winnen Emelye un-to his wyf; This is theffect and his entente pleyn. Now wol I torne un-to Arcite ageyn, That litel wiste how ny that was his care, Til that fortune had broght him in the snare. The bisy larke, messager of day, Saluëth in hir song the morwe gray; And fyry Phebus ryseth up so brighte, That al the orient laugheth of the lighte, And with his stremes dryeth in the greves The silver dropes, hanging on the leves. And Arcite, that is in the court royal With Theseus, his squyer principal, Is risen, and loketh on the myrie day. And, for to doon his observaunce to May, Remembring on the poynt of his desyr, He on a courser, sterting as the fyr, Is riden in-to the feeldes, him to pleye, Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye; And to the grove, of which that I yow tolde, By aventure, his wey he gan to holde, To maken him a gerland of the greves, Were it of wodebinde or hawethorn-leves, And loude he song ageyn the sonne shene: ‘May, with alle thy floures and thy grene, Wel-come be thou, faire fresshe May, I hope that I som grene gete may.’ And from his courser, with a lusty herte, In-to the grove ful hastily he sterte, And in a path he rometh up and doun, Ther-as, by aventure, this Palamoun Was in a bush, that no man mighte him see, For sore afered of his deeth was he. No-thing ne knew he that it was Arcite: God wot he wolde have trowed it ful lyte. But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many yeres, That ‘feeld hath eyen, and the wode hath eres.’ It is ful fair a man to bere him evene, For al-day meteth men at unset stevene. Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe, That was so ny to herknen al his sawe, For in the bush he sitteth now ful stille. Whan that Arcite had romed al his fille, And songen al the roundel lustily, In-to a studie he fil sodeynly, As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres, Now in the croppe, now doun in the breres, Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle. Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle, Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste, Right so can gery Venus overcaste The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array. Selde is the Friday al the wyke y-lyke. Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to syke, And sette him doun with-outen any more: ‘Alas!’ quod he, ‘that day that I was bore! How longe, Iuno, thurgh thy crueltee, Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee? Allas! y-broght is to confusioun The blood royal of Cadme and Amphioun; Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan, And of the citee first was crouned king, Of his linage am I, and his of-spring By verray ligne, as of the stok royal: And now I am so caitif and so thral, That he, that is my mortal enemy, I serve him as his squyer povrely. And yet doth Iuno me wel more shame, For I dar noght biknowe myn owne name; But ther-as I was wont to highte Arcite, Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte. Allas! thou felle Mars, allas! Iuno, Thus hath your ire our kinrede al fordo, Save only me, and wrecched Palamoun, That Theseus martyreth in prisoun. And over al this, to sleen me utterly, Love hath his fyry dart so brenningly Y-stiked thurgh my trewe careful herte, That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte. Ye sleen me with your eyen, Emelye; Ye been the cause wherfor that I dye. Of al the remenant of myn other care Ne sette I nat the mountaunce of a tare, So that I coude don aught to your plesaunce!’ And with that word he fil doun in a traunce A longe tyme; and after he up-sterte. This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte He felte a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde, For ire he quook, no lenger wolde he byde. And whan that he had herd Arcites tale, As he were wood, with face deed and pale, He sterte him up out of the buskes thikke, And seyde: ‘Arcite, false traitour wikke, Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so, For whom that I have al this peyne and wo, And art my blood, and to my counseil sworn, As I ful ofte have told thee heer-biforn, And hast by-iaped here duk Theseus, And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus; I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye. Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye, But I wol love hir only, and namo; For I am Palamoun, thy mortal fo. And though that I no wepne have in this place, But out of prison am astert by grace, I drede noght that outher thou shalt dye, Or thou ne shalt nat loven Emelye. Chees which thou wilt, for thou shalt nat asterte.’ This Arcitë, with ful despitous herte, Whan he him knew, and hadde his tale herd, As fiers as leoun, pulled out a swerd, And seyde thus: ‘by God that sit above, Nere it that thou art sik, and wood for love, And eek that thou no wepne hast in this place, Thou sholdest never out of this grove pace, That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond. For I defye the seurtee and the bond Which that thou seyst that I have maad to thee. What, verray fool, think wel that love is free, And I wol love hir, maugre al thy might! But, for as muche thou art a worthy knight, And wilnest to darreyne hir by batayle, Have heer my trouthe, to-morwe I wol nat fayle, With-outen witing of any other wight, That here I wol be founden as a knight, And bringen harneys right y-nough for thee; And chees the beste, and leve the worste for me. And mete and drinke this night wol I bringe Y-nough for thee, and clothes for thy beddinge. And, if so be that thou my lady winne, And slee me in this wode ther I am inne, Thou mayst wel have thy lady, as for me.’ This Palamon answerde: ‘I graunte it thee.’ And thus they been departed til a-morwe, When ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe. O Cupide, out of alle charitee! O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee! Ful sooth is seyd, that love ne lordshipe Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe; Wel finden that Arcite and Palamoun. Arcite is riden anon un-to the toun, And on the morwe, er it were dayes light, Ful prively two harneys hath he dight, Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne. And on his hors, allone as he was born, He carieth al this harneys him biforn; And in the grove, at tyme and place y-set, This Arcite and this Palamon ben met. Tho chaungen gan the colour in hir face; Right as the hunter in the regne of Trace, That stondeth at the gappe with a spere, Whan hunted is the leoun or the bere, And hereth him come russhing in the greves, And breketh bothe bowes and the leves, And thinketh, ‘heer cometh my mortel enemy, With-oute faile, he moot be deed, or I; For outher I mot sleen him at the gappe, Or he mot sleen me, if that me mishappe:’ So ferden they, in chaunging of hir hewe, As fer as everich of hem other knewe. Ther nas no good day, ne no saluing; But streight, with-outen word or rehersing, Everich of hem halp for to armen other, As freendly as he were his owne brother; And after that, with sharpe speres stronge They foynen ech at other wonder longe. Thou mightest wene that this Palamoun In his fighting were a wood leoun, And as a cruel tygre was Arcite: As wilde bores gonne they to smyte, That frothen whyte as foom for ire wood. Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood. And in this wyse I lete hem fighting dwelle; And forth I wol of Theseus yow telle. The destinee, ministre general, That executeth in the world over-al The purveyaunce, that God hath seyn biforn, So strong it is, that, though the world had sworn The contrarie of a thing, by ye or nay, Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day That falleth nat eft with-inne a thousand yere. For certeinly, our appetytes here, Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love, Al is this reuled by the sighte above. This mene I now by mighty Theseus, That for to honten is so desirous, And namely at the grete hert in May, That in his bed ther daweth him no day, That he nis clad, and redy for to ryde With hunte and horn, and houndes him bisyde. For in his hunting hath he swich delyt, That it is al his Ioye and appetyt To been him-self the grete hertes bane; For after Mars he serveth now Diane. Cleer was the day, as I have told er this, And Theseus, with alle Ioye and blis, With his Ipolita, the fayre quene, And Emelye, clothed al in grene, On hunting be they riden royally. And to the grove, that stood ful faste by, In which ther was an hert, as men him tolde, Duk Theseus the streighte wey hath holde. And to the launde he rydeth him ful right, For thider was the hert wont have his flight, And over a brook, and so forth on his weye. This duk wol han a cours at him, or tweye, With houndes, swiche as that him list comaunde. A whan this duk was come un-to the launde, Under the sonne he loketh, and anon He was war of Arcite and Palamon, That foughten breme, as it were bores two; The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro So hidously, that with the leeste strook It seemed as it wolde felle an ook; But what they were, no-thing he ne woot. This duk his courser with his spores smoot, And at a stert he was bitwix hem two, And pulled out a swerd and cryed, ‘ho! Namore, up peyne of lesing of your heed. By mighty Mars, he shal anon be deed, That smyteth any strook, that I may seen! But telleth me what mister men ye been, That been so hardy for to fighten here With-outen Iuge or other officere, As it were in a listes royally?’ This Palamon answerde hastily, And seyde: ‘sire, what nedeth wordes mo? We have the deeth deserved bothe two. Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves, That been encombred of our owne lyves; And as thou art a rightful lord and Iuge, Ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge, But slee me first, for seynte charitee; But slee my felawe eek as wel as me. Or slee him first; for, though thou knowe it lyte, This is thy mortal fo, this is Arcite, That fro thy lond is banished on his heed, For which he hath deserved to be deed. For this is he that cam un-to thy gate, And seyde, that he highte Philostrate. Thus hath he Iaped thee ful many a yeer, And thou has maked him thy chief squyer; And this is he that loveth Emelye. For sith the day is come that I shal dye, I make pleynly my confessioun, That I am thilke woful Palamoun, That hath thy prison broken wikkedly. I am thy mortal fo, and it am I That loveth so hote Emelye the brighte, That I wol dye present in hir sighte. Therfore I axe deeth and my Iuwyse; But slee my felawe in the same wyse, For bothe han we deserved to be slayn.’ This worthy duk answerde anon agayn, And seyde, ‘This is a short conclusioun: Youre owne mouth, by your confessioun, Hath dampned you, and I wol it recorde, It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde. Ye shul be deed, by mighty Mars the rede!’ The quene anon, for verray wommanhede, Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye, And alle the ladies in the companye. Gret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle, That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle; For gentil men they were, of greet estat, And no-thing but for love was this debat; And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore; And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more, ‘Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!’ And on hir bare knees adoun they falle, And wolde have kist his feet ther-as he stood, Til at the laste aslaked was his mood; For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte. And though he first for ire quook and sterte, He hath considered shortly, in a clause, The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause: And al-though that his ire hir gilt accused, Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused; As thus: he thoghte wel, that every man Wol helpe him-self in love, if that he can, And eek delivere him-self out of prisoun; And eek his herte had compassioun Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon; And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon, And softe un-to himself he seyde: ‘fy Up-on a lord that wol have no mercy, But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede, To hem that been in repentaunce and drede As wel as to a proud despitous man That wol maynteyne that he first bigan! That lord hath litel of discrecioun, That in swich cas can no divisioun, But weyeth pryde and humblesse after oon.’ And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon, He gan to loken up with eyen lighte, And spak thise same wordes al on highte:— ‘The god of love, a! benedicite, How mighty and how greet a lord is he! Ayeins his might ther gayneth none obstacles, He may be cleped a god for his miracles; For he can maken at his owne gyse Of everich herte, as that him list devyse. Lo heer, this Arcite and this Palamoun, That quitly weren out of my prisoun, And mighte han lived in Thebes royally, And witen I am hir mortal enemy, And that hir deeth lyth in my might also, And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two, Y-broght hem hider bothe for to dye! Now loketh, is nat that an heigh folye? Who may been a fool, but-if he love? Bihold, for Goddes sake that sit above, Se how they blede! be they noght wel arrayed? Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, y-payed Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse! And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse That serven love, for aught that may bifalle! But this is yet the beste game of alle, That she, for whom they han this Iolitee, Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me; She woot namore of al this hote fare, By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare! But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold; A man mot been a fool, or yong or old; I woot it by my-self ful yore agoon: For in my tyme a servant was I oon. And therfore, sin I knowe of loves peyne, And woot how sore it can a man distreyne, As he that hath ben caught ofte in his las, I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespas, At requeste of the quene that kneleth here, And eek of Emelye, my suster dere. And ye shul bothe anon un-to me swere, That never-mo ye shul my contree dere, Ne make werre up-on me night ne day, But been my freendes in al that ye may; I yow foryeve this trespas every del.’ And they him swore his axing fayre and wel, And him of lordshipe and of mercy preyde, And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde: ‘To speke of royal linage and richesse, Though that she were a quene or a princesse, Ech of yow bothe is worthy, doutelees, To wedden whan tyme is, but nathelees I speke as for my suster Emelye, For whom ye have this stryf and Ielousye; Ye woot your-self, she may not wedden two At ones, though ye fighten ever-mo: That oon of yow, al be him looth or leef, He moot go pypen in an ivy-leef; This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe, Al be ye never so Ielous, ne so wrothe. And for-thy I yow putte in this degree, That ech of yow shal have his destinee As him is shape; and herkneth in what wyse; Lo, heer your ende of that I shal devyse. My wil is this, for plat conclusioun, With-outen any replicacioun, If that yow lyketh, tak it for the beste, That everich of yow shal gon wher him leste Frely, with-outen raunson or daunger; And this day fifty wykes, fer ne ner, Everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes, Armed for listes up at alle rightes, Al redy to darreyne hir by bataille. And this bihote I yow, with-outen faille, Up-on my trouthe, and as I am a knight, That whether of yow bothe that hath might, This is to seyn, that whether he or thou May with his hundred, as I spak of now, Sleen his contrarie, or out of listes dryve, Him shal I yeve Emelya to wyve, To whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace. The listes shal I maken in this place, And God so wisly on my soule rewe, As I shal even Iuge been and trewe. Ye shul non other ende with me maken, That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken. And if yow thinketh this is wel y-sayd, Seyeth your avys, and holdeth yow apayd. This is your ende and your conclusioun.’ Who loketh lightly now but Palamoun? Who springeth up for Ioye but Arcite? Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte, The Ioye that is maked in the place Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace? But doun on knees wente every maner wight, And thanked him with al her herte and might, And namely the Thebans ofte sythe. And thus with good hope and with herte blythe They take hir leve, and hom-ward gonne they ryde To Thebes, with his olde walles wyde. Explicit secunda pars. Sequitur pars tercia. I trowe men wolde deme it necligence, If I foryete to tellen the dispence Of Theseus, that goth so bisily To maken up the listes royally; That swich a noble theatre as it was, I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas. The circuit a myle was aboute, Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute. Round was the shap, in maner of compas, Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas, That, whan a man was set on o degree, He letted nat his felawe for to see. Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt, West-ward, right swich another in the opposit. And shortly to concluden, swich a place Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space; For in the lond ther nas no crafty man, That geometrie or ars-metrik can, Ne purtreyour, ne kerver of images, That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages The theatre for to maken and devyse. And for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse, He est-ward hath, up-on the gate above, In worship of Venus, goddesse of love, Don make an auter and an oratorie; And west-ward, in the minde and in memorie Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another, That coste largely of gold a fother. And north-ward, in a touret on the wal, Of alabastre whyt and reed coral An oratorie riche for to see, In worship of Dyane of chastitee, Hath Theseus don wroght in noble wyse. But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse The noble kerving, and the portreitures, The shap, the countenaunce, and the figures, That weren in thise oratories three. First in the temple of Venus maystow see Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde, The broken slepes, and the sykes colde; The sacred teres, and the waymenting; The fyry strokes of the desiring, That loves servaunts in this lyf enduren; The othes, that hir covenants assuren; Plesaunce and hope, desyr, fool-hardinesse, Beautee and youthe, bauderie, richesse, Charmes and force, lesinges, flaterye, Dispense, bisynesse, and Ielousye, That wered of yelwe goldes a gerland, And a cokkow sitting on hir hand; Festes, instruments, caroles, daunces, Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal, By ordre weren peynted on the wal, And mo than I can make of mencioun. For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun, Ther Venus hath hir principal dwelling, Was shewed on the wal in portreying, With al the gardin, and the lustinesse. Nat was foryeten the porter Ydelnesse, Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon, Ne yet the folye of king Salamon, Ne yet the grete strengthe of Hercules— Thenchauntements of Medea and Circes— Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage, The riche Cresus, caytif in servage. Thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse, Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe, ne hardinesse, Ne may with Venus holde champartye; For as hir list the world than may she gye. Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las, Til they for wo ful ofte seyde ‘alas!’ Suffyceth heer ensamples oon or two, And though I coude rekne a thousand mo. The statue of Venus, glorious for to see, Was naked fleting in the large see, And fro the navele doun all covered was With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas. A citole in hir right hand hadde she, And on hir heed, ful semely for to see, A rose gerland, fresh and wel smellinge; Above hir heed hir dowves flikeringe. Biforn hir stood hir sone Cupido, Up-on his shuldres winges hadde he two; And blind he was, as it is ofte sene; A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene. Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al The portreiture, that was up-on the wal With-inne the temple of mighty Mars the rede? Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede, Lyk to the estres of the grisly place, That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace, In thilke colde frosty regioun, Ther-as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun. First on the wal was peynted a foreste, In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste, With knotty knarry bareyn treës olde Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde; In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough, As though a storm sholde bresten every bough: And downward from an hille, under a bente, Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente, Wroght al of burned steel, of which thentree Was long and streit, and gastly for to see. And ther-out cam a rage and such a vese, That it made al the gates for to rese. The northren light in at the dores shoon, For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon, Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne. The dores were alle of adamant eterne, Y-clenched overthwart and endelong With iren tough; and, for to make it strong, Every piler, the temple to sustene, Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene. Ther saugh I first the derke imagining Of felonye, and al the compassing; The cruel ire, reed as any glede; The pykepurs, and eek the pale drede; The smyler with the knyf under the cloke; The shepne brenning with the blake smoke; The treson of the mordring in the bedde; The open werre, with woundes al bi-bledde; Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace; Al ful of chirking was that sory place. The sleere of him-self yet saugh I ther, His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer; The nayl y-driven in the shode a-night; The colde deeth, with mouth gaping up-right. Amiddes of the temple sat meschaunce, With disconfort and sory contenaunce. Yet saugh I woodnesse laughing in his rage; Armed compleint, out-hees, and fiers outrage. The careyne in the bush, with throte y-corve: A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm y-storve; The tiraunt, with the prey by force y-raft; The toun destroyed, ther was no-thing laft. Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres; The hunte strangled with the wilde beres: The sowe freten the child right in the cradel; The cook y-scalded, for al his longe ladel. Noght was foryeten by the infortune of Marte; The carter over-riden with his carte, Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun. Ther were also, of Martes divisioun, The barbour, and the bocher, and the smith That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith. And al above, depeynted in a tour, Saw I conquest sittinge in greet honour, With the sharpe swerde over his heed Hanginge by a sotil twynes threed. Depeynted was the slaughtre of Iulius, Of grete Nero, and of Antonius; Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn, Yet was hir deeth depeynted ther-biforn, By manasinge of Mars, right by figure; So was it shewed in that portreiture As is depeynted in the sterres above, Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love. Suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde, I may not rekne hem alle, thogh I wolde. The statue of Mars up-on a carte stood, Armed, and loked grim as he were wood; And over his heed ther shynen two figures Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures, That oon Puella, that other Rubeus. This god of armes was arrayed thus:— A wolf ther stood biforn him at his feet With eyen rede, and of a man he eet; With sotil pencel was depeynt this storie, In redoutinge of Mars and of his glorie. Now to the temple of Diane the chaste As shortly as I can I wol me haste, To telle yow al the descripcioun. Depeynted been the walles up and doun Of hunting and of shamfast chastitee. Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee, Whan that Diane agreved was with here, Was turned from a womman til a bere, And after was she maad the lode-sterre; Thus was it peynt, I can say yow no ferre; Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see. Ther saugh I Dane, y-turned til a tree, I mene nat the goddesse Diane, But Penneus doughter, which that highte Dane. Ther saugh I Attheon an hert y-maked, For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked; I saugh how that his houndes have him caught, And freten him, for that they knewe him naught. Yet peynted was a litel forther-moor, How Atthalante hunted the wilde boor, And Meleagre, and many another mo, For which Diane wroghte him care and wo. Ther saugh I many another wonder storie, The whiche me list nat drawen to memorie. This goddesse on an hert ful hye seet, With smale houndes al aboute hir feet; And undernethe hir feet she hadde a mone, Wexing it was, and sholde wanie sone. In gaude grene hir statue clothed was, With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas. Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun, Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun. A womman travailinge was hir biforn, But, for hir child so longe was unborn, Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calle, And seyde, ‘help, for thou mayst best of alle.’ Wel couthe he peynten lyfly that it wroghte, With many a florin he the hewes boghte. Now been thise listes maad, and Theseus, That at his grete cost arrayed thus The temples and the theatre every del, Whan it was doon, him lyked wonder wel. But stinte I wol of Theseus a lyte, And speke of Palamon and of Arcite. The day approcheth of hir retourninge, That everich sholde an hundred knightes bringe, The bataille to darreyne, as I yow tolde; And til Athenes, hir covenant for to holde, Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knightes Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes. And sikerly, ther trowed many a man That never, sithen that the world bigan, As for to speke of knighthod of hir hond, As fer as God hath maked see or lond, Nas, of so fewe, so noble a companye. For every wight that lovede chivalrye, And wolde, his thankes, han a passant name, Hath preyed that he mighte ben of that game; And wel was him, that ther-to chosen was. For if ther fille to-morwe swich a cas, Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knight, That loveth paramours, and hath his might, Were it in Engelond, or elles-where, They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there. To fighte for a lady, benedicite! It were a lusty sighte for to see. And right so ferden they with Palamon. With him ther wenten knightes many oon; Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun, In a brest-plat and in a light gipoun; And somme woln have a peyre plates large; And somme woln have a Pruce sheld, or a targe; Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel, And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel. Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old. Armed were they, as I have you told, Everich after his opinioun. Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun Ligurge him-self, the grete king of Trace; Blak was his berd, and manly was his face. The cercles of his eyen in his heed, They gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed; And lyk a griffon loked he aboute, With kempe heres on his browes stoute; His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge, His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe. And as the gyse was in his contree, Ful hye up-on a char of gold stood he, With foure whyte boles in the trays. In-stede of cote-armure over his harnays, With nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold, He hadde a beres skin, col-blak, for-old. His longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak, As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak: A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte, Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte, Of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts. Aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts, Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer, To hunten at the leoun or the deer, And folwed him, with mosel faste y-bounde, Colers of gold, and torets fyled rounde. An hundred lordes hadde he in his route Armed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute. With Arcita, in stories as men finde, The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde, Up-on a stede bay, trapped in steel, Covered in cloth of gold diapred weel, Cam ryding lyk the god of armes, Mars. His cote-armure was of cloth of Tars, Couched with perles whyte and rounde and grete. His sadel was of brend gold newe y-bete; A mantelet upon his shuldre hanginge Bret-ful of rubies rede, as fyr sparklinge. His crispe heer lyk ringes was y-ronne, And that was yelow, and glitered as the sonne. His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citryn, His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn, A fewe fraknes in his face y-spreynd, Betwixen yelow and somdel blak y-meynd, And as a leoun he his loking caste. Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste. His berd was wel bigonne for to springe; His voys was as a trompe thunderinge. Up-on his heed he wered of laurer grene A gerland fresh and lusty for to sene. Up-on his hand he bar, for his deduyt, An egle tame, as eny lilie whyt. An hundred lordes hadde he with him there, Al armed, sauf hir heddes, in al hir gere, Ful richely in alle maner thinges. For trusteth wel, that dukes, erles, kinges, Were gadered in this noble companye, For love and for encrees of chivalrye. Aboute this king ther ran on every part Ful many a tame leoun and lepart. And in this wyse thise lordes, alle and some, Ben on the Sonday to the citee come Aboute pryme, and in the toun alight. This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight, Whan he had broght hem in-to his citee, And inned hem, everich in his degree, He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labour To esen hem, and doon hem al honour, That yet men weneth that no mannes wit Of noon estat ne coude amenden it. The minstralcye, the service at the feste, The grete yiftes to the moste and leste, The riche array of Theseus paleys, Ne who sat first ne last up-on the deys, What ladies fairest been or best daunsinge, Or which of hem can dauncen best and singe, Ne who most felingly speketh of love: What haukes sitten on the perche above, What houndes liggen on the floor adoun: Of al this make I now no mencioun; But al theffect, that thinketh me the beste; Now comth the poynt, and herkneth if yow leste. The Sonday night, er day bigan to springe, When Palamon the larke herde singe, Although it nere nat day by houres two, Yet song the larke, and Palamon also. With holy herte, and with an heigh corage He roos, to wenden on his pilgrimage Un-to the blisful Citherea benigne, I mene Venus, honurable and digne. And in hir houre he walketh forth a pas Un-to the listes, ther hir temple was, And doun he kneleth, and with humble chere And herte soor, he seyde as ye shul here. ‘Faireste of faire, o lady myn, Venus, Doughter to Iove and spouse of Vulcanus, Thou glader of the mount of Citheroun, For thilke love thou haddest to Adoun, Have pitee of my bittre teres smerte, And tak myn humble preyer at thyn herte. Allas! I ne have no langage to telle Theffectes ne the torments of myn helle; Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye; I am so confus, that I can noght seye. But mercy, lady bright, that knowest weel My thought, and seest what harmes that I feel, Considere al this, and rewe up-on my sore, As wisly as I shal for evermore, Emforth my might, thy trewe servant be, And holden werre alwey with chastitee; That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe. I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe, Ne I ne axe nat to-morwe to have victorie, Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorie Of pris of armes blowen up and doun, But I wolde have fully possessioun Of Emelye, and dye in thy servyse; Find thou the maner how, and in what wyse. I recche nat, but it may bettre be, To have victorie of hem, or they of me, So that I have my lady in myne armes. For though so be that Mars is god of armes, Your vertu is so greet in hevene above, That, if yow list, I shal wel have my love. Thy temple wol I worshipe evermo, And on thyn auter, wher I ryde or go, I wol don sacrifice, and fyres bete. And if ye wol nat so, my lady swete, Than preye I thee, to-morwe with a spere That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere. Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf, Though that Arcita winne hir to his wyf. This is theffect and ende of my preyere, Yif me my love, thou blisful lady dere.’ Whan thorisoun was doon of Palamon, His sacrifice he dide, and that anon Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces, Al telle I noght as now his observaunces. But atte laste the statue of Venus shook, And made a signe, wher-by that he took That his preyere accepted was that day. For thogh the signe shewed a delay, Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his bone; And with glad herte he wente him hoom ful sone. The thridde houre inequal that Palamon Bigan to Venus temple for to goon, Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye, And to the temple of Diane gan hye. Hir maydens, that she thider with hir ladde, Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde, Thencens, the clothes, and the remenant al That to the sacrifyce longen shal; The hornes fulle of meth, as was the gyse; Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifyse. Smoking the temple, ful of clothes faire, This Emelye, with herte debonaire, Hir body wessh with water of a welle; But how she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle, But it be any thing in general; And yet it were a game to heren al; To him that meneth wel, it were no charge: But it is good a man ben at his large. Hir brighte heer was kempt, untressed al; A coroune of a grene ook cerial Up-on hir heed was set ful fair and mete. Two fyres on the auter gan she bete, And dide hir thinges, as men may biholde In Stace of Thebes, and thise bokes olde. Whan kindled was the fyr, with pitous chere Un-to Diane she spak, as ye may here. ‘O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene, To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene, Quene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe, Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe Ful many a yeer, and woost what I desire, As keep me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire, That Attheon aboughte cruelly. Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I Desire to been a mayden al my lyf, Ne never wol I be no love ne wyf. I am, thou woost, yet of thy companye, A mayde, and love hunting and venerye, And for to walken in the wodes wilde, And noght to been a wyf, and be with childe. Noght wol I knowe companye of man. Now help me, lady, sith ye may and can, For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee. And Palamon, that hath swich love to me, And eek Arcite, that loveth me so sore, This grace I preye thee with-oute more, As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two; And fro me turne awey hir hertes so, That al hir hote love, and hir desyr, And al hir bisy torment, and hir fyr Be queynt, or turned in another place; And if so be thou wolt not do me grace, Or if my destinee be shapen so, That I shal nedes have oon of hem two, As sende me him that most desireth me. Bihold, goddesse of clene chastitee, The bittre teres that on my chekes falle. Sin thou are mayde, and keper of us alle, My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve, And whyl I live a mayde, I wol thee serve.’ The fyres brenne up-on the auter clere, Whyl Emelye was thus in hir preyere; But sodeinly she saugh a sighte queynte, For right anon oon of the fyres queynte, And quiked agayn, and after that anon That other fyr was queynt, and al agon; And as it queynte, it made a whistelinge, As doon thise wete brondes in hir brenninge, And at the brondes ende out-ran anoon As it were blody dropes many oon; For which so sore agast was Emelye, That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crye, For she ne wiste what it signifyed; But only for the fere thus hath she cryed, And weep, that it was pitee for to here. And ther-with-al Diane gan appere, With bowe in hond, right as an hunteresse, And seyde: ‘Doghter, stint thyn hevinesse. Among the goddes hye it is affermed, And by eterne word write and confermed, Thou shalt ben wedded un-to oon of tho That han for thee so muchel care and wo; But un-to which of hem I may nat telle. Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle. The fyres which that on myn auter brenne Shul thee declaren, er that thou go henne, Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas.’ And with that word, the arwes in the cas Of the goddesse clateren faste and ringe, And forth she wente, and made a vanisshinge; For which this Emelye astoned was, And seyde, ‘What amounteth this, allas! I putte me in thy proteccioun, Diane, and in thy disposicioun.’ And hoom she gooth anon the nexte weye. This is theffect, ther is namore to seye. The nexte houre of Mars folwinge this, Arcite un-to the temple walked is Of fierse Mars, to doon his sacrifyse, With alle the rytes of his payen wyse. With pitous herte and heigh devocioun, Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun: ‘O stronge god, that in the regnes colde Of Trace honoured art, and lord y-holde, And hast in every regne and every lond Of armes al the brydel in thyn hond, And hem fortunest as thee list devyse, Accept of me my pitous sacrifyse. If so be that my youthe may deserve, And that my might be worthy for to serve Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thyne, Than preye I thee to rewe up-on my pyne. For thilke peyne, and thilke hote fyr, In which thou whylom brendest for desyr, Whan that thou usedest the grete beautee Of fayre yonge fresshe Venus free, And haddest hir in armes at thy wille, Al-though thee ones on a tyme misfille Whan Vulcanus had caught thee in his las, And fond thee ligging by his wyf, allas! For thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte, Have routhe as wel up-on my peynes smerte. I am yong and unkonning, as thou wost, And, as I trowe, with love offended most, That ever was any lyves creature; For she, that dooth me al this wo endure, Ne reccheth never wher I sinke or flete. And wel I woot, er she me mercy hete, I moot with strengthe winne hir in the place; And wel I woot, withouten help or grace Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle. Than help me, lord, to-morwe in my bataille, For thilke fyr that whylom brente thee, As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me; And do that I to-morwe have victorie. Myn be the travaille, and thyn be the glorie! Thy soverein temple wol I most honouren Of any place, and alwey most labouren In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge, And in thy temple I wol my baner honge, And alle the armes of my companye; And evere-mo, un-to that day I dye, Eterne fyr I wol biforn thee finde. And eek to this avow I wol me binde: My berd, myn heer that hongeth long adoun, That never yet ne felte offensioun Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive, And ben thy trewe servant whyl I live. Now lord, have routhe up-on my sorwes sore, Yif me victorie, I aske thee namore.’ The preyere stinte of Arcita the stronge, The ringes on the temple-dore that honge, And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste, Of which Arcita som-what him agaste. The fyres brende up-on the auter brighte, That it gan al the temple for to lighte; And swete smel the ground anon up-yaf, And Arcita anon his hand up-haf, And more encens in-to the fyr he caste, With othere rytes mo; and atte laste The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk ringe. And with that soun he herde a murmuringe Ful lowe and dim, that sayde thus, ‘Victorie:’ For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie. And thus with Ioye, and hope wel to fare, Arcite anon un-to his inne is fare, As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne. And right anon swich stryf ther is bigonne For thilke graunting, in the hevene above, Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love, And Mars, the sterne god armipotente, That Iupiter was bisy it to stente; Til that the pale Saturnus the colde, That knew so manye of aventures olde, Fond in his olde experience an art, That he ful sone hath plesed every part. As sooth is sayd, elde hath greet avantage; In elde is bothe wisdom and usage; Men may the olde at-renne, and noght at-rede. Saturne anon, to stinten stryf and drede, Al be it that it is agayn his kynde, Of al this stryf he gan remedie fynde. ‘My dere doghter Venus,’ quod Saturne, ‘My cours, that hath so wyde for to turne, Hath more power than wot any man. Myn is the drenching in the see so wan; Myn is the prison in the derke cote; Myn is the strangling and hanging by the throte; The murmure, and the cherles rebelling, The groyning, and the pryvee empoysoning: I do vengeance and pleyn correccioun Whyl I dwelle in the signe of the leoun. Myn is the ruine of the hye halles, The falling of the toures and of the walles Up-on the mynour or the carpenter. I slow Sampsoun in shaking the piler; And myne be the maladyes colde, The derke tresons, and the castes olde; My loking is the fader of pestilence. Now weep namore, I shal doon diligence That Palamon, that is thyn owne knight, Shal have his lady, as thou hast him hight. Though Mars shal helpe his knight, yet nathelees Bitwixe yow ther moot be som tyme pees, Al be ye noght of o complexioun, That causeth al day swich divisioun. I am thin ayel, redy at thy wille; Weep thou namore, I wol thy lust fulfille.’ Now wol I stinten of the goddes above, Of Mars, and of Venus, goddesse of love, And telle yow, as pleynly as I can, The grete effect, for which that I bigan. Explicit tercia pars. Sequitur pars quarta. Greet was the feste in Athenes that day, And eek the lusty seson of that May Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce, That al that Monday Iusten they and daunce, And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse. But by the cause that they sholde ryse Erly, for to seen the grete fight, Unto hir reste wente they at night. And on the morwe, whan that day gan springe, Of hors and harneys, noyse and clateringe Ther was in hostelryes al aboute; And to the paleys rood ther many a route Of lordes, up-on stedes and palfreys. Ther maystow seen devysing of herneys So uncouth and so riche, and wroght so weel Of goldsmithrie, of browding, and of steel; The sheeldes brighte, testers, and trappures; Gold-hewen helmes, hauberks, cote-armures; Lordes in paraments on hir courseres, Knightes of retenue, and eek squyeres Nailinge the speres, and helmes bokelinge, Gigginge of sheeldes, with layneres lacinge; Ther as need is, they weren no-thing ydel; The fomy stedes on the golden brydel Gnawinge, and faste the armurers also With fyle and hamer prikinge to and fro; Yemen on fote, and communes many oon With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon; Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes, That in the bataille blowen blody sounes; The paleys ful of peples up and doun, Heer three, ther ten, holding hir questioun, Divyninge of thise Thebane knightes two. Somme seyden thus, somme seyde it shal be so; Somme helden with him with the blake berd, Somme with the balled, somme with the thikke-herd; Somme sayde, he loked grim and he wolde fighte; He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte. Thus was the halle ful of divyninge, Longe after that the sonne gan to springe. The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked With minstralcye and noyse that was maked, Held yet the chambre of his paleys riche, Til that the Thebane knightes, bothe y-liche Honoured, were into the paleys fet. Duk Theseus was at a window set, Arrayed right as he were a god in trone. The peple preesseth thider-ward ful sone Him for to seen, and doon heigh reverence, And eek to herkne his hest and his sentence. An heraud on a scaffold made an ho, Til al the noyse of the peple was y-do; And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille, Tho showed he the mighty dukes wille. ‘The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun Considered, that it were destruccioun To gentil blood, to fighten in the gyse Of mortal bataille now in this empryse; Wherfore, to shapen that they shul not dye, He wol his firste purpos modifye. No man therfor, up peyne of los of lyf, No maner shot, ne pollax, ne short knyf Into the listes sende, or thider bringe; Ne short swerd for to stoke, with poynt bytinge, No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde. Ne no man shal un-to his felawe ryde But o cours, with a sharp y-grounde spere; Foyne, if him list, on fote, him-self to were. And he that is at meschief, shal be take, And noght slayn, but be broght un-to the stake That shal ben ordeyned on either syde; But thider he shal by force, and ther abyde. And if so falle, the chieftayn be take On either syde, or elles slee his make, No lenger shal the turneyinge laste. God spede yow; goth forth, and ley on faste. With long swerd and with maces fight your fille. Goth now your wey; this is the lordes wille.’ The voys of peple touchede the hevene, So loude cryden they with mery stevene: ‘God save swich a lord, that is so good, He wilneth no destruccioun of blood!’ Up goon the trompes and the melodye. And to the listes rit the companye By ordinaunce, thurgh-out the citee large, Hanged with cloth of gold, and nat with sarge. Ful lyk a lord this noble duk gan ryde, Thise two Thebanes up-on either syde; And after rood the quene, and Emelye, And after that another companye Of oon and other, after hir degree. And thus they passen thurgh-out the citee, And to the listes come they by tyme. It nas not of the day yet fully pryme, Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye, Ipolita the quene and Emelye, And other ladies in degrees aboute. Un-to the seetes preesseth al the route. And west-ward, thurgh the gates under Marte, Arcite, and eek the hundred of his parte, With baner reed is entred right anon; And in that selve moment Palamon Is under Venus, est-ward in the place, With baner whyt, and hardy chere and face. In al the world, to seken up and doun, So even with-outen variacioun, Ther nere swiche companyes tweye. For ther nas noon so wys that coude seye, That any hadde of other avauntage Of worthinesse, ne of estaat, ne age, So even were they chosen, for to gesse. And in two renges faire they hem dresse. Whan that hir names rad were everichoon, That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon, Tho were the gates shet, and cryed was loude: ‘Do now your devoir, yonge knightes proude!’ The heraudes lefte hir priking up and doun; Now ringen trompes loude and clarioun; Ther is namore to seyn, but west and est In goon the speres ful sadly in arest; In goth the sharpe spore in-to the syde. Ther seen men who can Iuste, and who can ryde; Ther shiveren shaftes up-on sheeldes thikke; He feleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke. Up springen speres twenty foot on highte; Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte. The helmes they to-hewen and to-shrede; Out brest the blood, with sterne stremes rede. With mighty maces the bones they to-breste. He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste. Ther stomblen stedes stronge, and doun goth al. He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal. He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun, And he him hurtleth with his hors adoun. He thurgh the body is hurt, and sithen y-take, Maugree his heed, and broght un-to the stake, As forward was, right ther he moste abyde; Another lad is on that other syde. And som tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste, Hem to refresshe, and drinken if hem leste. Ful ofte a-day han thise Thebanes two Togidre y-met, and wroght his felawe wo; Unhorsed hath ech other of hem tweye. Ther nas no tygre in the vale of Galgopheye, Whan that hir whelp is stole, whan it is lyte, So cruel on the hunte, as is Arcite For Ielous herte upon this Palamoun: Ne in Belmarye ther nis so fel leoun, That hunted is, or for his hunger wood, Ne of his praye desireth so the blood, As Palamon to sleen his fo Arcite. The Ielous strokes on hir helmes byte; Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede. Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede; For er the sonne un-to the reste wente, The stronge king Emetreus gan hente This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite, And made his swerd depe in his flesh to byte; And by the force of twenty is he take Unyolden, and y-drawe unto the stake. And in the rescous of this Palamoun The stronge king Ligurge is born adoun; And king Emetreus, for al his strengthe, Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe, So hitte him Palamon er he were take; But al for noght, he was broght to the stake. His hardy herte mighte him helpe naught; He moste abyde, whan that he was caught By force, and eek by composicioun. Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun, That moot namore goon agayn to fighte? And whan that Theseus had seyn this sighte, Un-to the folk that foghten thus echoon He cryde, ‘Ho! namore, for it is doon! I wol be trewe Iuge, and no partye. Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelye, That by his fortune hath hir faire y-wonne.’ Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne For Ioye of this, so loude and heigh with-alle, It semed that the listes sholde falle. What can now faire Venus doon above? What seith she now? what dooth this quene of love? But wepeth so, for wanting of hir wille, Til that hir teres in the listes fille; She seyde: ‘I am ashamed, doutelees.’ Saturnus seyde: ‘Doghter, hold thy pees. Mars hath his wille, his knight hath al his bone, And, by myn heed, thou shalt ben esed sone.’ The trompes, with the loude minstralcye, The heraudes, that ful loude yolle and crye, Been in hir wele for Ioye of daun Arcite. But herkneth me, and stinteth now a lyte, Which a miracle ther bifel anon. This fierse Arcite hath of his helm y-don, And on a courser, for to shewe his face, He priketh endelong the large place, Loking upward up-on this Emelye; And she agayn him caste a freendlich yë, (For wommen, as to speken in comune, They folwen al the favour of fortune), And she was al his chere, as in his herte. Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte, From Pluto sent, at requeste of Saturne, For which his hors for fere gan to turne, And leep asyde, and foundred as he leep; And, er that Arcite may taken keep, He pighte him on the pomel of his heed, That in the place he lay as he were deed, His brest to-brosten with his sadel-bowe. As blak he lay as any cole or crowe, So was the blood y-ronnen in his face. Anon he was y-born out of the place With herte soor, to Theseus paleys. Tho was he corven out of his harneys, And in a bed y-brought ful faire and blyve, For he was yet in memorie and alyve, And alway crying after Emelye. Duk Theseus, with al his companye, Is comen hoom to Athenes his citee, With alle blisse and greet solempnitee. Al be it that this aventure was falle, He nolde noght disconforten hem alle. Men seyde eek, that Arcite shal nat dye; He shal ben heled of his maladye. And of another thing they were as fayn, That of hem alle was ther noon y-slayn, Al were they sore y-hurt, and namely oon, That with a spere was thirled his brest-boon. To othere woundes, and to broken armes, Some hadden salves, and some hadden charmes; Fermacies of herbes, and eek save They dronken, for they wolde hir limes have. For which this noble duk, as he wel can, Conforteth and honoureth every man, And made revel al the longe night, Un-to the straunge lordes, as was right. Ne ther was holden no disconfitinge, But as a Iustes or a tourneyinge; For soothly ther was no disconfiture, For falling nis nat but an aventure; Ne to be lad with fors un-to the stake Unyolden, and with twenty knightes take, O persone allone, with-outen mo, And haried forth by arme, foot, and to, And eek his stede driven forth with staves, With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves, It nas aretted him no vileinye, Ther may no man clepen it cowardye. For which anon duk Theseus leet crye, To stinten alle rancour and envye, The gree as wel of o syde as of other, And either syde y-lyk, as otheres brother; And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree, And fully heeld a feste dayes three; And conveyed the kinges worthily Out of his toun a Iournee largely. And hoom wente every man the righte way. Ther was namore, but ‘far wel, have good day!’ Of this bataille I wol namore endyte, But speke of Palamon and of Arcite. Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the sore Encreesseth at his herte more and more. The clothered blood, for any lechecraft, Corrupteth, and is in his bouk y-laft, That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusinge, Ne drinke of herbes may ben his helpinge. The vertu expulsif, or animal, Fro thilke vertu cleped natural Ne may the venim voyden, ne expelle. The pypes of his longes gonne to swelle, And every lacerte in his brest adoun Is shent with venim and corrupcioun. Him gayneth neither, for to gete his lyf, Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif; Al is to-brosten thilke regioun, Nature hath now no dominacioun. And certeinly, ther nature wol nat wirche, Far-wel, phisyk! go ber the man to chirche! This al and som, that Arcita mot dye, For which he sendeth after Emelye, And Palamon, that was his cosin dere; Than seyde he thus, as ye shul after here. ‘Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte Declare o poynt of alle my sorwes smerte To yow, my lady, that I love most; But I biquethe the service of my gost To yow aboven every creature, Sin that my lyf may no lenger dure. Allas, the wo! allas, the peynes stronge, That I for yow have suffred, and so longe! Allas, the deeth! allas, myn Emelye! Allas, departing of our companye! Allas, myn hertes quene! allas, my wyf! Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf! What is this world? what asketh men to have? Now with his love, now in his colde grave Allone, with-outen any companye. Far-wel, my swete fo! myn Emelye! And softe tak me in your armes tweye, For love of God, and herkneth what I seye. I have heer with my cosin Palamon Had stryf and rancour, many a day a-gon, For love of yow, and for my Ielousye. And Iupiter so wis my soule gye, To speken of a servant proprely, With alle circumstaunces trewely, That is to seyn, trouthe, honour, and knighthede, Wisdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kinrede, Fredom, and al that longeth to that art, So Iupiter have of my soule part, As in this world right now ne knowe I non So worthy to ben loved as Palamon, That serveth yow, and wol don al his lyf. And if that ever ye shul been a wyf, Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man.’ And with that word his speche faille gan, For from his feet up to his brest was come The cold of deeth, that hadde him overcome. And yet more-over, in his armes two The vital strengthe is lost, and al ago. Only the intellect, with-outen more, That dwelled in his herte syk and sore, Gan faillen, when the herte felte deeth, Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth. But on his lady yet caste he his yë; His laste word was, ‘mercy, Emelye!’ His spirit chaunged hous, and wente ther, As I cam never, I can nat tellen wher. Therfor I stinte, I nam no divinistre; Of soules finde I nat in this registre, Ne me ne list thilke opiniouns to telle Of hem, though that they wryten wher they dwelle. Arcite is cold, ther Mars his soule gye; Now wol I speken forth of Emelye. Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon, And Theseus his suster took anon Swowninge, and bar hir fro the corps away. What helpeth it to tarien forth the day, To tellen how she weep, bothe eve and morwe? For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe, Whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago, That for the more part they sorwen so, Or elles fallen in swich maladye, That at the laste certeinly they dye. Infinite been the sorwes and the teres Of olde folk, and folk of tendre yeres, In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban; For him ther wepeth bothe child and man; So greet a weping was ther noon, certayn, Whan Ector was y-broght, al fresh y-slayn, To Troye; allas! the pitee that was ther, Cracching of chekes, rending eek of heer. ‘Why woldestow be deed,’ thise wommen crye, ‘And haddest gold y-nough, and Emelye?’ No man mighte gladen Theseus, Savinge his olde fader Egeus, That knew this worldes transmutacioun, As he had seyn it chaungen up and doun, Ioye after wo, and wo after gladnesse: And shewed hem ensamples and lyknesse. ‘Right as ther deyed never man,’ quod he, ‘That he ne livede in erthe in som degree, Right so ther livede never man,’ he seyde, ‘In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde. This world nis but a thurghfare ful of wo, And we ben pilgrimes, passinge to and fro; Deeth is an ende of every worldly sore.’ And over al this yet seyde he muchel more To this effect, ful wysly to enhorte The peple, that they sholde hem reconforte. Duk Theseus, with al his bisy cure, Caste now wher that the sepulture Of good Arcite may best y-maked be, And eek most honurable in his degree. And at the laste he took conclusioun, That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene, That in that selve grove, swote and grene, Ther as he hadde his amorous desires, His compleynt, and for love his hote fires, He wolde make a fyr, in which thoffice Funeral he mighte al accomplice; And leet comaunde anon to hakke and hewe The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe In colpons wel arrayed for to brenne; His officers with swifte feet they renne And ryde anon at his comaundement. And after this, Theseus hath y-sent After a bere, and it al over-spradde With cloth of gold, the richest that he hadde. And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite; Upon his hondes hadde he gloves whyte; Eek on his heed a croune of laurer grene, And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene. He leyde him bare the visage on the bere, Therwith he weep that pitee was to here. And for the peple sholde seen him alle, Whan it was day, he broghte him to the halle, That roreth of the crying and the soun. Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun, With flotery berd, and ruggy asshy heres, In clothes blake, y-dropped al with teres; And, passing othere of weping, Emelye, The rewfulleste of al the companye. In as muche as the service sholde be The more noble and riche in his degree, Duk Theseus leet forth three stedes bringe, That trapped were in steel al gliteringe, And covered with the armes of daun Arcite. Up-on thise stedes, that weren grete and whyte, Ther seten folk, of which oon bar his sheeld, Another his spere up in his hondes heeld; The thridde bar with him his bowe Turkeys, Of brend gold was the cas, and eek the harneys; And riden forth a pas with sorweful chere Toward the grove, as ye shul after here. The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were Upon hir shuldres carieden the bere, With slakke pas, and eyen rede and wete, Thurgh-out the citee, by the maister-strete, That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye Right of the same is al the strete y-wrye. Up-on the right hond wente old Egeus, And on that other syde duk Theseus, With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn, Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn; Eek Palamon, with ful greet companye; And after that cam woful Emelye, With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse, To do thoffice of funeral servyse. Heigh labour, and ful greet apparaillinge Was at the service and the fyr-makinge, That with his grene top the heven raughte, And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte; This is to seyn, the bowes were so brode. Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode. But how the fyr was maked up on highte, And eek the names how the treës highte, As ook, firre, birch, asp, alder, holm, popler, Wilow, elm, plane, ash, box, chasteyn, lind, laurer, Mapul, thorn, beech, hasel, ew, whippeltree, How they weren feld, shal nat be told for me; Ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun, Disherited of hir habitacioun, In which they woneden in reste and pees, Nymphes, Faunes, and Amadrides; Ne how the bestes and the briddes alle Fledden for fere, whan the wode was falle; Ne how the ground agast was of the light, That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright; Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree, And than with drye stokkes cloven a three, And than with grene wode and spycerye, And than with cloth of gold and with perrye, And gerlandes hanging with ful many a flour, The mirre, thencens, with al so greet odour; Ne how Arcite lay among al this, Ne what richesse aboute his body is; Ne how that Emelye, as was the gyse, Putte in the fyr of funeral servyse; Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr, Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desyr; Ne what Ieweles men in the fyr tho caste, Whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste; Ne how som caste hir sheeld, and som hir spere, And of hir vestiments, whiche that they were, And cuppes ful of wyn, and milk, and blood, Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood; Ne how the Grekes with an huge route Thryës riden al the fyr aboute Up-on the left hand, with a loud shoutinge, And thryës with hir speres clateringe; And thryës how the ladies gonne crye; Ne how that lad was hom-ward Emelye; Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde; Ne how that liche-wake was y-holde Al thilke night, ne how the Grekes pleye The wake-pleyes, ne kepe I nat to seye; Who wrastleth best naked, with oille enoynt, Ne who that bar him best, in no disioynt. I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon Hoom til Athenes, whan the pley is doon; But shortly to the poynt than wol I wende, And maken of my longe tale an ende. By processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres Al stinted is the moorning and the teres Of Grekes, by oon general assent. Than semed me ther was a parlement At Athenes, up-on certeyn poynts and cas; Among the whiche poynts y-spoken was To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce, And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce. For which this noble Theseus anon Leet senden after gentil Palamon, Unwist of him what was the cause and why; But in his blake clothes sorwefully He cam at his comaundement in hye. Tho sente Theseus for Emelye. Whan they were set, and hust was al the place, And Theseus abiden hadde a space Er any word cam from his wyse brest, His eyen sette he ther as was his lest, And with a sad visage he syked stille, And after that right thus he seyde his wille. ‘The firste moevere of the cause above, Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love, Greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente; Wel wiste he why, and what ther-of he mente; For with that faire cheyne of love he bond The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee; That same prince and that moevere,’ quod he, ‘Hath stablissed, in this wrecched world adoun, Certeyne dayes and duracioun To al that is engendred in this place, Over the whiche day they may nat pace, Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge; Ther needeth non auctoritee allegge, For it is preved by experience, But that me list declaren my sentence. Than may men by this ordre wel discerne, That thilke moevere stable is and eterne. Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool, That every part deryveth from his hool. For nature hath nat take his beginning Of no partye ne cantel of a thing, But of a thing that parfit is and stable, Descending so, til it be corrumpable. And therfore, of his wyse purveyaunce, He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce, That speces of thinges and progressiouns Shullen enduren by successiouns, And nat eterne be, with-oute lye: This maistow understonde and seen at yë. ‘Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshinge From tyme that it first biginneth springe, And hath so long a lyf, as we may see, Yet at the laste wasted is the tree. ‘Considereth eek, how that the harde stoon Under our feet, on which we trede and goon, Yit wasteth it, as it lyth by the weye. The brode river somtyme wexeth dreye. The grete tounes see we wane and wende. Than may ye see that al this thing hath ende. ‘Of man and womman seen we wel also, That nedeth, in oon of thise termes two, This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age, He moot ben deed, the king as shal a page; Som in his bed, som in the depe see, Som in the large feeld, as men may se; Ther helpeth noght, al goth that ilke weye. Thanne may I seyn that al this thing moot deye. What maketh this but Iupiter the king? The which is prince and cause of alle thing, Converting al un-to his propre welle, From which it is deryved, sooth to telle. And here-agayns no creature on lyve Of no degree availleth for to stryve. ‘Thanne is it wisdom, as it thinketh me, To maken vertu of necessitee, And take it wel, that we may nat eschue, And namely that to us alle is due. And who-so gruccheth ought, he dooth folye, And rebel is to him that al may gye. And certeinly a man hath most honour To dyen in his excellence and flour, Whan he is siker of his gode name; Than hath he doon his freend, ne him, no shame. And gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth, Whan with honour up-yolden is his breeth, Than whan his name apalled is for age; For al forgeten is his vasselage. Than is it best, as for a worthy fame, To dyen whan that he is best of name. The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse. Why grucchen we? why have we hevinesse, That good Arcite, of chivalrye flour Departed is, with duetee and honour, Out of this foule prison of this lyf? Why grucchen heer his cosin and his wyf Of his wel-fare that loved hem so weel? Can he hem thank? nay, God wot, never a deel, That bothe his soule and eek hem-self offende, And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende. ‘What may I conclude of this longe serie, But, after wo, I rede us to be merie, And thanken Iupiter of al his grace? And, er that we departen from this place, I rede that we make, of sorwes two, O parfyt Ioye, lasting ever-mo; And loketh now, wher most sorwe is her-inne, Ther wol we first amenden and biginne. ‘Suster,’ quod he, ‘this is my fulle assent, With al thavys heer of my parlement, That gentil Palamon, your owne knight, That serveth yow with wille, herte, and might, And ever hath doon, sin that ye first him knewe, That ye shul, of your grace, up-on him rewe, And taken him for housbonde and for lord: Leen me your hond, for this is our accord. Lat see now of your wommanly pitee. He is a kinges brother sone, pardee; And, though he were a povre bacheler, Sin he hath served yow so many a yeer, And had for yow so greet adversitee, It moste been considered, leveth me; For gentil mercy oghte to passen right.’ Than seyde he thus to Palamon ful right; ‘I trowe ther nedeth litel sermoning To make yow assente to this thing. Com neer, and tak your lady by the hond.’ Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond, That highte matrimoine or mariage, By al the counseil and the baronage. And thus with alle blisse and melodye Hath Palamon y-wedded Emelye. And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght, Sende him his love, that hath it dere a-boght. For now is Palamon in alle wele, Living in blisse, in richesse, and in hele; And Emelye him loveth so tendrely, And he hir serveth al-so gentilly, That never was ther no word hem bitwene Of Ielousye, or any other tene. Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye; And God save al this faire companye!—Amen. Here is ended the Knightes Tale. THE MILLER'S PROLOGUE. Here folwen the wordes bitwene the Host and the Millere. Whan that the Knight had thus his tale y-told, In al the route nas ther yong ne old That he ne seyde it was a noble storie, And worthy for to drawen to memorie; And namely the gentils everichoon. Our Hoste lough and swoor, ‘so moot I goon, This gooth aright; unbokeled is the male; Lat see now who shal telle another tale: For trewely, the game is wel bigonne. Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye conne, Sumwhat, to quyte with the Knightes tale.’ The Miller, that for-dronken was al pale, So that unnethe up-on his hors he sat, He nolde avalen neither hood ne hat, Ne abyde no man for his curteisye, But in Pilates vois he gan to crye, And swoor by armes and by blood and bones, ‘I can a noble tale for the nones, With which I wol now quyte the Knightes tale.’ Our Hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale, And seyde: ‘abyd, Robin, my leve brother, Som bettre man shal telle us first another: Abyd, and lat us werken thriftily.’ ‘By goddes soul,’ quod he, ‘that wol nat I; For I wol speke, or elles go my wey.’ Our Hoste answerde: ‘tel on, a devel wey! Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.’ ‘Now herkneth,’ quod the Miller, ‘alle and some! But first I make a protestacioun That I am dronke, I knowe it by my soun; And therfore, if that I misspeke or seye, Wyte it the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye; For I wol telle a legende and a lyf Bothe of a Carpenter, and of his wyf, How that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe.’ The Reve answerde and seyde, ‘stint thy clappe, Lat be thy lewed dronken harlotrye. It is a sinne and eek a greet folye To apeiren any man, or him diffame, And eek to bringen wyves in swich fame. Thou mayst y-nogh of othere thinges seyn.’ This dronken Miller spak ful sone ageyn, And seyde, ‘leve brother Osewold, Who hath no wyf, he is no cokewold. But I sey nat therfore that thou art oon; Ther been ful gode wyves many oon, And ever a thousand gode ayeyns oon badde, That knowestow wel thy-self, but-if thou madde. Why artow angry with my tale now? I have a wyf, pardee, as well as thou, Yet nolde I, for the oxen in my plogh, Taken up-on me more than y-nogh, As demen of my-self that I were oon; I wol beleve wel that I am noon. An housbond shal nat been inquisitif Of goddes privetee, nor of his wyf. So he may finde goddes foyson there, Of the remenant nedeth nat enquere.’ What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere He nolde his wordes for no man forbere, But tolde his cherles tale in his manere; Me thinketh that I shal reherce it here. And ther-fore every gentil wight I preye, For goddes love, demeth nat that I seye Of evel entente, but that I moot reherce Hir tales alle, be they bettre or werse, Or elles falsen som of my matere. And therfore, who-so list it nat y-here, Turne over the leef, and chese another tale; For he shal finde y-nowe, grete and smale, Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse, And eek moralitee and holinesse; Blameth nat me if that ye chese amis. The Miller is a cherl, ye knowe wel this; So was the Reve, and othere many mo, And harlotrye they tolden bothe two. Avyseth yow and putte me out of blame; And eek men shal nat make ernest of game. Here endeth the prologe. THE MILLERES TALE. Here biginneth the Millere his tale. Whylom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord, And of his craft he was a Carpenter. With him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler, Had lerned art, but al his fantasye Was turned for to lerne astrologye, And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns To demen by interrogaciouns, If that men axed him in certein houres, Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures, Or if men axed him what sholde bifalle Of every thing, I may nat rekene hem alle. This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas; Of derne love he coude and of solas; And ther-to he was sleigh and ful privee, And lyk a mayden meke for to see. A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye Allone, with-outen any companye, Ful fetisly y-dight with herbes swote; And he him-self as swete as is the rote Of licorys, or any cetewale. His Almageste and bokes grete and smale, His astrelabie, longinge for his art, His augrim-stones layen faire a-part On shelves couched at his beddes heed: His presse y-covered with a falding reed. And al above ther lay a gay sautrye, On which he made a nightes melodye So swetely, that al the chambre rong; And Angelus ad virginem he song; And after that he song the kinges note; Ful often blessed was his mery throte. And thus this swete clerk his tyme spente After his freendes finding and his rente. This Carpenter had wedded newe a wyf Which that he lovede more than his lyf; Of eightetene yeer she was of age. Ialous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage, For she was wilde and yong, and he was old, And demed him-self ben lyk a cokewold. He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude, That bad man sholde wedde his similitude. Men sholde wedden after hir estaat, For youthe and elde is often at debaat. But sith that he was fallen in the snare, He moste endure, as other folk, his care. Fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al As any wesele hir body gent and smal. A ceynt she werede barred al of silk, A barmclooth eek as whyt as morne milk Up-on hir lendes, ful of many a gore. Whyt was hir smok, and brouded al bifore And eek bihinde, on hir coler aboute, Of col-blak silk, with-inne and eek with-oute. The tapes of hir whyte voluper Were of the same suyte of hir coler; Hir filet brood of silk, and set ful hye: And sikerly she hadde a likerous yë. Ful smale y-pulled were hir browes two, And tho were bent, and blake as any sloo. She was ful more blisful on to see Than is the newe pere-ionette tree; And softer than the wolle is of a wether. And by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether Tasseld with silk, and perled with latoun. In al this world, to seken up and doun, There nis no man so wys, that coude thenche So gay a popelote, or swich a wenche. Ful brighter was the shyning of hir hewe Than in the tour the noble y-forged newe. But of hir song, it was as loude and yerne As any swalwe sittinge on a berne. Ther-to she coude skippe and make game, As any kide or calf folwinge his dame. Hir mouth was swete as bragot or the meeth, Or hord of apples leyd in hey or heeth. Winsinge she was, as is a Ioly colt, Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt. A brooch she baar up-on hir lowe coler, As brood as is the bos of a bocler. Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye; She was a prymerole, a pigges-nye For any lord to leggen in his bedde, Or yet for any good yeman to wedde. Now sire, and eft sire, so bifel the cas, That on a day this hende Nicholas Fil with this yonge wyf to rage and pleye, Whyl that hir housbond was at Oseneye, As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte; And prively he caughte hir by the queynte, And seyde, ‘y-wis, but if ich have my wille, For derne love of thee, lemman, I spille.’ And heeld hir harde by the haunche-bones, And seyde, ‘lemman, love me al at-ones, Or I wol dyen, also god me save!’ And she sprong as a colt doth in the trave, And with hir heed she wryed faste awey, And seyde, ‘I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey, Why, lat be,’ quod she, ‘lat be, Nicholas, Or I wol crye out “harrow” and “allas.” Do wey your handes for your curteisye!’ This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye, And spak so faire, and profred hir so faste, That she hir love him graunted atte laste, And swoor hir ooth, by seint Thomas of Kent, That she wol been at his comandement, Whan that she may hir leyser wel espye. ‘Myn housbond is so ful of Ialousye, That but ye wayte wel and been privee, I woot right wel I nam but deed,’ quod she. ‘Ye moste been ful derne, as in this cas.’ ‘Nay ther-of care thee noght,’ quod Nicholas, ‘A clerk had litherly biset his whyle, But-if he coude a Carpenter bigyle.’ And thus they been acorded and y-sworn To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn. Whan Nicholas had doon thus everydeel, And thakked hir aboute the lendes weel, He kist hir swete, and taketh his sautrye, And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodye. Than fil it thus, that to the parish-chirche, Cristes owne werkes for to wirche, This gode wyf wente on an haliday; Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day, So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk. Now was ther of that chirche a parish-clerk, The which that was y-cleped Absolon. Crul was his heer, and as the gold it shoon, And strouted as a fanne large and brode; Ful streight and even lay his Ioly shode. His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos; With Powles window corven on his shoos, In hoses rede he wente fetisly. Y-clad he was ful smal and proprely, Al in a kirtel of a light wachet; Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set. And ther-up-on he hadde a gay surplys As whyt as is the blosme up-on the rys. A mery child he was, so god me save, Wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave, And make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce. In twenty manere coude he trippe and daunce After the scole of Oxenforde tho, And with his legges casten to and fro, And pleyen songes on a small rubible; Ther-to he song som-tyme a loud quinible; And as wel coude he pleye on his giterne. In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne That he ne visited with his solas, Ther any gaylard tappestere was. But sooth to seyn, he was somdel squaymous Of farting, and of speche daungerous. This Absolon, that Iolif was and gay, Gooth with a sencer on the haliday, Sensinge the wyves of the parish faste; And many a lovely look on hem he caste, And namely on this carpenteres wyf. To loke on hir him thoughte a mery lyf, She was so propre and swete and likerous. I dar wel seyn, if she had been a mous, And he a cat, he wolde hir hente anon. This parish-clerk, this Ioly Absolon, Hath in his herte swich a love-longinge, That of no wyf ne took he noon offringe; For curteisye, he seyde, he wolde noon. The mone, whan it was night, ful brighte shoon, And Absolon his giterne hath y-take, For paramours, he thoghte for to wake. And forth he gooth, Iolif and amorous, Til he cam to the carpenteres hous A litel after cokkes hadde y-crowe; And dressed him up by a shot-windowe That was up-on the carpenteres wal. He singeth in his vois gentil and smal, ‘Now, dere lady, if thy wille be, I preye yow that ye wol rewe on me,’ Ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge. This carpenter awook, and herde him singe, And spak un-to his wyf, and seyde anon, ‘What! Alison! herestow nat Absolon That chaunteth thus under our boures wal?’ And she answerde hir housbond ther-with-al, ‘Yis, god wot, Iohn, I here it every-del.’ This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than wel? Fro day to day this Ioly Absolon So woweth hir, that him is wo bigon. He waketh al the night and al the day; He kempte hise lokkes brode, and made him gay; He woweth hir by menes and brocage, And swoor he wolde been hir owne page; He singeth, brokkinge as a nightingale; He sente hir piment, meeth, and spyced ale, And wafres, pyping hote out of the glede; And for she was of toune, he profred mede. For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse, And som for strokes, and som for gentillesse. Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye, He pleyeth Herodes on a scaffold hye. But what availleth him as in this cas? She loveth so this hende Nicholas, That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn; He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn; And thus she maketh Absolon hir ape, And al his ernest turneth til a Iape. Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye, Men seyn right thus, ‘alwey the nye slye Maketh the ferre leve to be looth.’ For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth, By-cause that he fer was from hir sighte, This nye Nicholas stood in his lighte. Now bere thee wel, thou hende Nicholas! For Absolon may waille and singe ‘allas.’ And so bifel it on a Saterday, This carpenter was goon til Osenay; And hende Nicholas and Alisoun Acorded been to this conclusioun, That Nicholas shal shapen him a wyle This sely Ialous housbond to bigyle; And if so be the game wente aright, She sholde slepen in his arm al night, For this was his desyr and hir also. And right anon, with-outen wordes mo, This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie, But doth ful softe un-to his chambre carie Bothe mete and drinke for a day or tweye, And to hir housbonde bad hir for to seye, If that he axed after Nicholas, She sholde seye she niste where he was, Of al that day she saugh him nat with yë; She trowed that he was in maladye, For, for no cry, hir mayde coude him calle; He nolde answere, for no-thing that mighte falle. This passeth forth al thilke Saterday, That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay, And eet and sleep, or dide what him leste, Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste. This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle Of Nicholas, or what thing mighte him eyle, And seyde, ‘I am adrad, by seint Thomas, It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas. God shilde that he deyde sodeynly! This world is now ful tikel, sikerly; I saugh to-day a cors y-born to chirche That now, on Monday last, I saugh him wirche. Go up,’ quod he un-to his knave anoon, ‘Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon, Loke how it is, and tel me boldely.’ This knave gooth him up ful sturdily, And at the chambre-dore, whyl that he stood, He cryde and knokked as that he were wood:— ‘What! how! what do ye, maister Nicholay? How may ye slepen al the longe day?’ But al for noght, he herde nat a word; An hole he fond, ful lowe up-on a bord, Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe; And at that hole he looked in ful depe, And at the laste he hadde of him a sighte. This Nicholas sat gaping ever up-righte, As he had kyked on the newe mone. Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister sone In what array he saugh this ilke man. This carpenter to blessen him bigan, And seyde, ‘help us, seinte Frideswyde! A man woot litel what him shal bityde. This man is falle, with his astromye, In som woodnesse or in som agonye; I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be! Men sholde nat knowe of goddes privetee. Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man, That noght but oonly his bileve can! So ferde another clerk with astromye; He walked in the feeldes for to prye Up-on the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle, Til he was in a marle-pit y-falle; He saugh nat that. But yet, by seint Thomas, Me reweth sore of hende Nicholas. He shal be rated of his studying, If that I may, by Iesus, hevene king! Get me a staf, that I may underspore, Whyl that thou, Robin, hevest up the dore. He shal out of his studying, as I gesse’— And to the chambre-dore he gan him dresse. His knave was a strong carl for the nones, And by the haspe he haf it up atones; In-to the floor the dore fil anon. This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon, And ever gaped upward in-to the eir. This carpenter wende he were in despeir, And hente him by the sholdres mightily, And shook him harde, and cryde spitously, ‘What! Nicholay! what, how! what! loke adoun! Awake, and thenk on Cristes passioun; I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes!’ Ther-with the night-spel seyde he anon-rightes On foure halves of the hous aboute, And on the threshfold of the dore with-oute:— ‘Iesu Crist, and seynt Benedight, Blesse this hous from every wikked wight, For nightes verye, the white pater-noster! Where wentestow, seynt Petres soster?’ And atte laste this hende Nicholas Gan for to syke sore, and seyde, ‘allas! Shal al the world be lost eftsones now?’ This carpenter answerde, ‘what seystow? What! thenk on god, as we don, men that swinke.’ This Nicholas answerde, ‘fecche me drinke; And after wol I speke in privetee Of certeyn thing that toucheth me and thee; I wol telle it non other man, certeyn.’ This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn, And broghte of mighty ale a large quart; And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part, This Nicholas his dore faste shette, And doun the carpenter by him he sette. He seyde, ‘Iohn, myn hoste lief and dere, Thou shalt up-on thy trouthe swere me here, That to no wight thou shalt this counseil wreye; For it is Cristes conseil that I seye, And if thou telle it man, thou are forlore; For this vengaunce thou shalt han therfore, That if thou wreye me, thou shalt be wood!’ ‘Nay, Crist forbede it, for his holy blood!’ Quod tho this sely man, ‘I nam no labbe, Ne, though I seye, I nam nat lief to gabbe. Sey what thou wolt, I shal it never telle To child ne wyf, by him that harwed helle!’ ‘Now John,’ quod Nicholas, ‘I wol nat lye; I have y-founde in myn astrologye, As I have loked in the mone bright, That now, a Monday next, at quarter-night, Shal falle a reyn and that so wilde and wood, That half so greet was never Noës flood. This world,’ he seyde, ‘in lasse than in an hour Shal al be dreynt, so hidous is the shour; Thus shal mankynde drenche and lese hir lyf.’ This carpenter answerde, ‘allas, my wyf! And shal she drenche? allas! myn Alisoun!’ For sorwe of this he fil almost adoun, And seyde, ‘is ther no remedie in this cas?’ ‘Why, yis, for gode,’ quod hende Nicholas, ‘If thou wolt werken after lore and reed; Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed. For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe, “Werk al by conseil, and thou shalt nat rewe.” And if thou werken wolt by good conseil, I undertake, with-outen mast and seyl, Yet shal I saven hir and thee and me. Hastow nat herd how saved was Noë, Whan that our lord had warned him biforn That al the world with water sholde be lorn?’ ‘Yis,’ quod this carpenter, ‘ful yore ago.’ ‘Hastow nat herd,’ quod Nicholas, ‘also The sorwe of Noë with his felawshipe, Er that he mighte gete his wyf to shipe? Him had be lever, I dar wel undertake, At thilke tyme, than alle hise wetheres blake, That she hadde had a ship hir-self allone. And ther-fore, wostou what is best to done? This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing Men may nat preche or maken tarying. Anon go gete us faste in-to this in A kneding-trogh, or elles a kimelin, For ech of us, but loke that they be large, In whiche we mowe swimme as in a barge, And han ther-inne vitaille suffisant But for a day; fy on the remenant! The water shal aslake and goon away Aboute pryme up-on the nexte day. But Robin may nat wite of this, thy knave, Ne eek thy mayde Gille I may nat save; Axe nat why, for though thou aske me, I wol nat tellen goddes privetee. Suffiseth thee, but if thy wittes madde, To han as greet a grace as Noë hadde. Thy wyf shal I wel saven, out of doute, Go now thy wey, and speed thee heer-aboute. But whan thou hast, for hir and thee and me, Y-geten us thise kneding-tubbes three, Than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hye, That no man of our purveyaunce spye. And whan thou thus hast doon as I have seyd, And hast our vitaille faire in hem y-leyd, And eek an ax, to smyte the corde atwo When that the water comth, that we may go, And broke an hole an heigh, up-on the gable, Unto the gardin-ward, over the stable, That we may frely passen forth our way Whan that the grete shour is goon away— Than shaltow swimme as myrie, I undertake, As doth the whyte doke after hir drake. Than wol I clepe, “how! Alison! how! John! Be myrie, for the flood wol passe anon.” And thou wolt seyn, “hayl, maister Nicholay! Good morwe, I se thee wel, for it is day.” And than shul we be lordes al our lyf Of al the world, as Noë and his wyf. But of o thyng I warne thee ful right, Be wel avysed, on that ilke night That we ben entred in-to shippes bord, That noon of us ne speke nat a word, Ne clepe, ne crye, but been in his preyere; For it is goddes owne heste dere. Thy wyf and thou mote hange fer a-twinne, For that bitwixe yow shal be no sinne No more in looking than ther shal in dede; This ordinance is seyd, go, god thee spede! Tomorwe at night, whan men ben alle aslepe, In-to our kneding-tubbes wol we crepe, And sitten ther, abyding goddes grace. Go now thy wey, I have no lenger space To make of this no lenger sermoning. Men seyn thus, “send the wyse, and sey no-thing;” Thou art so wys, it nedeth thee nat teche; Go, save our lyf, and that I thee biseche.’ This sely carpenter goth forth his wey. Ful ofte he seith ‘allas’ and ‘weylawey,’ And to his wyf he tolde his privetee; And she was war, and knew it bet than he, What al this queynte cast was for to seye. But nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye, And seyde, ‘allas! go forth thy wey anon, Help us to scape, or we ben lost echon; I am thy trewe verray wedded wyf; Go, dere spouse, and help to save our lyf.’ Lo! which a greet thyng is affeccioun! Men may dye of imaginacioun, So depe may impressioun be take. This sely carpenter biginneth quake; Him thinketh verraily that he may see Noës! flood come walwing as the see To drenchen Alisoun, his hony dere. He wepeth, weyleth, maketh sory chere, He syketh with ful many a sory swogh. He gooth and geteth him a kneding-trogh, And after that a tubbe and a kimelin, And prively he sente hem to his in, And heng hem in the roof in privetee. His owne hand he made laddres three, To climben by the ronges and the stalkes Un-to the tubbes hanginge in the balkes, And hem vitailled, bothe trogh and tubbe, With breed and chese, and good ale in a Iubbe, Suffysinge right y-nogh as for a day. But er that he had maad al this array, He sente his knave, and eek his wenche also, Up-on his nede to London for to go. And on the Monday, whan it drow to night, He shette his dore with-oute candel-light, And dressed al thing as it sholde be. And shortly, up they clomben alle three; They sitten stille wel a furlong-way. ‘Now, Pater-noster, clom!’ seyde Nicholay, And ‘clom,’ quod John, and ‘clom,’ seyde Alisoun. This carpenter seyde his devocioun, And stille he sit, and biddeth his preyere, Awaytinge on the reyn, if he it here. The dede sleep, for wery bisinesse, Fil on this carpenter right, as I gesse, Aboute corfew-tyme, or litel more; For travail of his goost he groneth sore, And eft he routeth, for his heed mislay. Doun of the laddre stalketh Nicholay, And Alisoun, ful softe adoun she spedde; With-outen wordes mo, they goon to bedde Ther-as the carpenter is wont to lye. Ther was the revel and the melodye; And thus lyth Alison and Nicholas, In bisinesse of mirthe and of solas, Til that the belle of laudes gan to ringe, And freres in the chauncel gonne singe. This parish-clerk, this amorous Absolon, That is for love alwey so wo bigon, Up-on the Monday was at Oseneye With companye, him to disporte and pleye, And axed up-on cas a cloisterer Ful prively after Iohn the carpenter; And he drough him a-part out of the chirche, And seyde, ‘I noot, I saugh him here nat wirche Sin Saterday; I trow that he be went For timber, ther our abbot hath him sent; For he is wont for timber for to go, And dwellen at the grange a day or two; Or elles he is at his hous, certeyn; Wher that he be, I can nat sothly seyn.’ This Absolon ful Ioly was and light, And thoghte, ‘now is tyme wake al night; For sikirly I saugh him nat stiringe Aboute his dore sin day bigan to springe. So moot I thryve, I shal, at cokkes crowe, Ful prively knokken at his windowe That stant ful lowe up-on his boures wal. To Alison now wol I tellen al My love-longing, for yet I shal nat misse That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse. Som maner confort shal I have, parfay, My mouth hath icched al this longe day; That is a signe of kissing atte leste. Al night me mette eek, I was at a feste. Therfor I wol gon slepe an houre or tweye, And al the night than wol I wake and pleye.’ Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon Up rist this Ioly lover Absolon, And him arrayeth gay, at point-devys. But first he cheweth greyn and lycorys, To smellen swete, er he had kembd his heer. Under his tonge a trewe love he beer, For ther-by wende he to ben gracious. He rometh to the carpenteres hous, And stille he stant under the shot-windowe; Un-to his brest it raughte, it was so lowe; And softe he cogheth with a semi-soun— ‘What do ye, hony-comb, swete Alisoun? My faire brid, my swete cinamome, Awaketh, lemman myn, and speketh to me! Wel litel thenken ye up-on my wo, That for your love I swete ther I go. No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete; I moorne as doth a lamb after the tete. Y-wis, lemman, I have swich love-longinge, That lyk a turtel trewe is my moorninge; I may nat ete na more than a mayde.’ ‘Go fro the window, Iakke fool,’ she sayde, ‘As help me god, it wol nat be “com ba me,” I love another, and elles I were to blame, Wel bet than thee, by Iesu, Absolon! Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston, And lat me slepe, a twenty devel wey!’ ‘Allas,’ quod Absolon, ‘and weylawey! That trewe love was ever so yvel biset! Than kisse me, sin it may be no bet, For Iesus love and for the love of me.’ ‘Wiltow than go thy wey ther-with?’ quod she. ‘Ye, certes, lemman,’ quod this Absolon. ‘Thanne make thee redy,’ quod she, ‘I come anon;’ And un-to Nicholas she seyde stille, ‘Now hust, and thou shalt laughen al thy fille.’ This Absolon doun sette him on his knees, And seyde, ‘I am a lord at alle degrees; For after this I hope ther cometh more! Lemman, thy grace, and swete brid, thyn ore!’ The window she undoth, and that in haste, ‘Have do,’ quod she, ‘com of, and speed thee faste, Lest that our neighebores thee espye.’ This Absolon gan wype his mouth ful drye; Derk was the night as pich, or as the cole, And at the window out she putte hir hole, And Absolon, him fil no bet ne wers, But with his mouth he kiste hir naked ers Ful savourly, er he was war of this. Abak he sterte, and thoghte it was amis, For wel he wiste a womman hath no berd; He felte a thing al rough and long y-herd, And seyde, ‘fy! allas! what have I do?’ ‘Tehee!’ quod she, and clapte the window to; And Absolon goth forth a sory pas. ‘A berd, a berd!’ quod hende Nicholas, ‘By goddes corpus, this goth faire and weel!’ This sely Absolon herde every deel, And on his lippe he gan for anger byte; And to him-self he seyde, ‘I shal thee quyte!’ Who rubbeth now, who froteth now his lippes With dust, with sond, with straw, with clooth, with chippes, But Absolon, that seith ful ofte, ‘allas! My soule bitake I un-to Sathanas, But me wer lever than al this toun,’ quod he, ‘Of this despyt awroken for to be! Allas!’ quod he, ‘allas! I ne hadde y-bleynt!’ His hote love was cold and al y-queynt; For fro that tyme that he had kiste hir ers, Of paramours he sette nat a kers, For he was heled of his maladye; Ful ofte paramours he gan deffye, And weep as dooth a child that is y-bete. A softe paas he wente over the strete Un-til a smith men cleped daun Gerveys, That in his forge smithed plough-harneys; He sharpeth shaar and culter bisily. This Absolon knokketh al esily, And seyde, ‘undo, Gerveys, and that anon.’ ‘What, who artow?’ ‘It am I, Absolon.’ ‘What, Absolon! for Cristes swete tree, Why ryse ye so rathe, ey, benedicite! What eyleth yow? som gay gerl, god it woot, Hath broght yow thus up-on the viritoot; By sëynt Note, ye woot wel what I mene.’ This Absolon ne roghte nat a bene Of al his pley, no word agayn he yaf; He hadde more tow on his distaf Than Gerveys knew, and seyde, ‘freend so dere, That hote culter in the chimenee here, As lene it me, I have ther-with to done, And I wol bringe it thee agayn ful sone.’ Gerveys answerde, ‘certes, were it gold, Or in a poke nobles alle untold, Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smith; Ey, Cristes foo! what wol ye do ther-with?’ ‘Ther-of,’ quod Absolon, ‘be as be may; I shal wel telle it thee to-morwe day’— And caughte the culter by the colde stele. Ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele, And wente un-to the carpenteres wal. He cogheth first, and knokketh ther-with-al Upon the windowe, right as he dide er. This Alison answerde, ‘Who is ther That knokketh so? I warante it a theef.’ ‘Why, nay,’ quod he, ‘god woot, my swete leef, I am thyn Absolon, my dereling! Of gold,’ quod he, ‘I have thee broght a ring; My moder yaf it me, so god me save, Ful fyn it is, and ther-to wel y-grave; This wol I yeve thee, if thou me kisse!’ This Nicholas was risen for to pisse, And thoghte he wolde amenden al the Iape, He sholde kisse his ers er that he scape. And up the windowe dide he hastily, And out his ers he putteth prively Over the buttok, to the haunche-bon; And ther-with spak this clerk, this Absolon, ‘Spek, swete brid, I noot nat wher thou art.’ This Nicholas anon leet flee a fart, As greet as it had been a thonder-dent, That with the strook he was almost y-blent; And he was redy with his iren hoot, And Nicholas amidde the ers he smoot. Of gooth the skin an hande-brede aboute, The hote culter brende so his toute, And for the smert he wende for to dye. As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye— ‘Help! water! water! help, for goddes herte!’ This carpenter out of his slomber sterte, And herde oon cryen ‘water’ as he were wood, And thoghte, ‘Allas! now comth Nowelis flood!’ He sit him up with-outen wordes mo, And with his ax he smoot the corde a-two, And doun goth al; he fond neither to selle, Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the selle Up-on the floor; and ther aswowne he lay. Up sterte hir Alison, and Nicholay, And cryden ‘out’ and ‘harrow’ in the strete. The neighebores, bothe smale and grete, In ronnen, for to gauren on this man, That yet aswowne he lay, bothe pale and wan; For with the fal he brosten hadde his arm; But stonde he moste un-to his owne harm. For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun With hende Nicholas and Alisoun. They tolden every man that he was wood, He was agast so of ‘Nowelis flood’ Thurgh fantasye, that of his vanitee He hadde y-boght him kneding-tubbes three, And hadde hem hanged in the roof above; And that he preyed hem, for goddes love, To sitten in the roof, par companye. The folk gan laughen at his fantasye; In-to the roof they kyken and they gape, And turned al his harm un-to a Iape. For what so that this carpenter answerde, It was for noght, no man his reson herde; With othes grete he was so sworn adoun, That he was holden wood in al the toun; For every clerk anon-right heeld with other. They seyde, ‘the man is wood, my leve brother;’ And every wight gan laughen of this stryf. Thus swyved was the carpenteres wyf, For al his keping and his Ialousye; And Absolon hath kist hir nether yë; And Nicholas is scalded in the toute. This tale is doon, and god save al the route! Here endeth the Millere his tale. THE REEVE'S PROLOGUE. The prologe of the Reves tale. Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas Of Absolon and hende Nicholas, Diverse folk diversely they seyde; But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde, Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve, But it were only Osewold the Reve, By-cause he was of carpenteres craft. A litel ire is in his herte y-laft, He gan to grucche and blamed it a lyte. ‘So theek,’ quod he, ‘ful wel coude I yow quyte With blering of a proud milleres yë, If that me liste speke of ribaudye. But ik am old, me list not pley for age; Gras-tyme is doon, my fodder is now forage, This whyte top wryteth myne olde yeres, Myn herte is al-so mowled as myne heres, But-if I fare as dooth an open-ers; That ilke fruit is ever leng the wers, Til it be roten in mullok or in stree. We olde men, I drede, so fare we; Til we be roten, can we nat be rype; We hoppen ay, whyl that the world wol pype. For in oure wil ther stiketh ever a nayl, To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl, As hath a leek; for thogh our might be goon, Our wil desireth folie ever in oon. For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke; Yet in our asshen olde is fyr y-reke. Foure gledes han we, whiche I shal devyse, Avaunting, lying, anger, coveityse; Thise foure sparkles longen un-to elde. Our olde lemes mowe wel been unwelde, But wil ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth. And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth, As many a yeer as it is passed henne Sin that my tappe of lyf bigan to renne. For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon Deeth drogh the tappe of lyf and leet it gon; And ever sith hath so the tappe y-ronne, Til that almost al empty is the tonne. The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chimbe; The sely tonge may wel ringe and chimbe Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore; With olde folk, save dotage, is namore.’ Whan that our host hadde herd this sermoning, He gan to speke as lordly as a king; He seide, ‘what amounteth al this wit? What shul we speke alday of holy writ? The devel made a reve for to preche, And of a souter a shipman or a leche. Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme, Lo, Depeford! and it is half-way pryme. Lo, Grenewich, ther many a shrewe is inne; It were al tyme thy tale to biginne.’ ‘Now, sires,’ quod this Osewold the Reve, ‘I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve, Thogh I answere and somdel sette his howve; For leveful is with force force of-showve. This dronke millere hath y-told us heer, How that bigyled was a carpenteer, Peraventure in scorn, for I am oon. And, by your leve, I shal him quyte anoon; Right in his cherles termes wol I speke. I pray to god his nekke mote breke; He can wel in myn yë seen a stalke, But in his owne he can nat seen a balke. THE REVES TALE. Here biginneth the Reves tale. At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge, Ther goth a brook and over that a brigge, Up-on the whiche brook ther stant a melle; And this is verray soth that I yow telle. A Miller was ther dwelling many a day; As eny pecok he was proud and gay. Pypen he coude and fisshe, and nettes bete, And turne coppes, and wel wrastle and shete; And by his belt he baar a long panade, And of a swerd ful trenchant was the blade. A Ioly popper baar he in his pouche; Ther was no man for peril dorste him touche. A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose; Round was his face, and camuse was his nose. As piled as an ape was his skulle. He was a market-beter atte fulle. Ther dorste no wight hand up-on him legge, That he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge. A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele, And that a sly, and usaunt for to stele. His name was hoten dëynous Simkin. A wyf he hadde, y-comen of noble kin; The person of the toun hir fader was. With hir he yaf ful many a panne of bras, For that Simkin sholde in his blood allye. She was y-fostred in a nonnerye; For Simkin wolde no wyf, as he sayde, But she were wel y-norissed and a mayde, To saven his estaat of yomanrye. And she was proud, and pert as is a pye. A ful fair sighte was it on hem two; On haly-dayes biforn hir wolde he go With his tipet bounden about his heed, And she cam after in a gyte of reed; And Simkin hadde hosen of the same. Ther dorste no wight clepen hir but ‘dame.’ Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye That with hir dorste rage or ones pleye, But-if he wolde be slayn of Simkin With panade, or with knyf, or boydekin. For Ialous folk ben perilous evermo, Algate they wolde hir wyves wenden so. And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich, She was as digne as water in a dich; And ful of hoker and of bisemare. Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hir spare, What for hir kinrede and hir nortelrye That she had lerned in the nonnerye. A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two Of twenty yeer, with-outen any mo, Savinge a child that was of half-yeer age; In cradel it lay and was a propre page. This wenche thikke and wel y-growen was, With camuse nose and yën greye as glas; With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye, But right fair was hir heer, I wol nat lye. The person of the toun, for she was feir, In purpos was to maken hir his heir Bothe of his catel and his messuage, And straunge he made it of hir mariage. His purpos was for to bistowe hir hye In-to som worthy blood of auncetrye; For holy chirches good moot been despended On holy chirches blood, that is descended. Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure, Though that he holy chirche sholde devoure. Gret soken hath this miller, out of doute, With whete and malt of al the land aboute; And nameliche ther was a greet collegge, Men clepen the Soler-halle at Cantebregge, Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt y-grounde. And on a day it happed, in a stounde, Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye; Men wenden wisly that he sholde dye. For which this miller stal bothe mele and corn An hundred tyme more than biforn; For ther-biforn he stal but curteisly, But now he was a theef outrageously, For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare. But ther-of sette the miller nat a tare; He craketh boost, and swoor it was nat so. Than were ther yonge povre clerkes two, That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye. Testif they were, and lusty for to pleye, And, only for hir mirthe and revelrye, Up-on the wardeyn bisily they crye, To yeve hem leve but a litel stounde To goon to mille and seen hir corn y-grounde; And hardily, they dorste leye hir nekke, The miller shold nat stele hem half a pekke Of corn by sleighte, ne by force hem reve; And at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve. Iohn hight that oon, and Aleyn hight that other; Of o toun were they born, that highte Strother, Fer in the north, I can nat telle where. This Aleyn maketh redy al his gere, And on an hors the sak he caste anon. Forth goth Aleyn the clerk, and also Iohn, With good swerd and with bokeler by hir syde. Iohn knew the wey, hem nedede no gyde, And at the mille the sak adoun he layth. Aleyn spak first, ‘al hayl, Symond, y-fayth; How fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?’ ‘Aleyn! welcome,’ quod Simkin, ‘by my lyf, And Iohn also, how now, what do ye heer?’ ‘Symond,’ quod Iohn, ‘by god, nede has na peer; Him boës serve him-selve that has na swayn, Or elles he is a fool, as clerkes sayn. Our manciple, I hope he wil be deed, Swa werkes ay the wanges in his heed. And forthy is I come, and eek Alayn, To grinde our corn and carie it ham agayn; I pray yow spede us hethen that ye may.’ ‘It shal be doon,’ quod Simkin, ‘by my fay; What wol ye doon whyl that it is in hande?’ ‘By god, right by the hoper wil I stande,’ Quod Iohn, ‘and se how that the corn gas in; Yet saugh I never, by my fader kin, How that the hoper wagges til and fra.’ Aleyn answerde, ‘Iohn, and wiltow swa, Than wil I be bynethe, by my croun, And se how that the mele falles doun In-to the trough; that sal be my disport. For Iohn, in faith, I may been of your sort; I is as ille a miller as are ye.’ This miller smyled of hir nycetee, And thoghte, ‘al this nis doon but for a wyle; They wene that no man may hem bigyle; But, by my thrift, yet shal I blere hir yë For al the sleighte in hir philosophye. The more queynte crekes that they make, The more wol I stele whan I take. In stede of flour, yet wol I yeve hem bren. “The gretteste clerkes been noght the wysest men,” As whylom to the wolf thus spak the mare; Of al hir art I counte noght a tare.’ Out at the dore he gooth ful prively, Whan that he saugh his tyme, softely; He loketh up and doun til he hath founde The clerkes hors, ther as it stood y-bounde Bihinde the mille, under a levesel; And to the hors he gooth him faire and wel; He strepeth of the brydel right anon. And whan the hors was loos, he ginneth gon Toward the fen, ther wilde mares renne, Forth with wehee, thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne. This miller gooth agayn, no word he seyde, But dooth his note, and with the clerkes pleyde, Til that hir corn was faire and wel y-grounde. And whan the mele is sakked and y-bounde, This Iohn goth out and fynt his hors away, And gan to crye ‘harrow’ and ‘weylaway! Our hors is lorn! Alayn, for goddes banes, Step on thy feet, com out, man, al at anes! Allas, our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn.’ This Aleyn al forgat, bothe mele and corn, Al was out of his mynde his housbondrye. ‘What? whilk way is he geen?’ he gan to crye. The wyf cam leping inward with a ren, She seyde, ‘allas! your hors goth to the fen With wilde mares, as faste as he may go. Unthank come on his hand that bond him so, And he that bettre sholde han knit the reyne.’ ‘Allas,’ quod Iohn, ‘Aleyn, for Cristes peyne, Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil myn alswa; I is ful wight, god waat, as is a raa; By goddes herte he sal nat scape us bathe. Why nadstow pit the capul in the lathe? Il-hayl, by god, Aleyn, thou is a fonne!’ This sely clerkes han ful faste y-ronne To-ward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek Iohn. And whan the miller saugh that they were gon, He half a busshel of hir flour hath take, And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake. He seyde, ‘I trowe the clerkes were aferd; Yet can a miller make a clerkes berd For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye. Lo wher they goon, ye, lat the children pleye; They gete him nat so lightly, by my croun!’ Thise sely clerkes rennen up and doun With ‘keep, keep, stand, stand, Iossa, warderere, Ga whistle thou, and I shal kepe him here!’ But shortly, til that it was verray night, They coude nat, though they do al hir might, Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste, Til in a dich they caughte him atte laste. Wery and weet, as beste is in the reyn, Comth sely Iohn, and with him comth Aleyn. ‘Allas,’ quod Iohn, ‘the day that I was born! Now are we drive til hething and til scorn. Our corn is stole, men wil us foles calle, Bathe the wardeyn and our felawes alle, And namely the miller; weylaway!’ Thus pleyneth Iohn as he goth by the way Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond. The miller sitting by the fyr he fond, For it was night, and forther mighte they noght; But, for the love of god, they him bisoght Of herberwe and of ese, as for hir peny. The miller seyde agayn, ‘if ther be eny, Swich as it is, yet shal ye have your part. Myn hous is streit, but ye han lerned art; Ye conne by argumentes make a place A myle brood of twenty foot of space. Lat see now if this place may suffyse, Or make it roum with speche, as is youre gyse.’ ‘Now, Symond,’ seyde Iohn, ‘by seint Cutberd, Ay is thou mery, and this is faire answerd. I have herd seyd, man sal taa of twa thinges Slyk as he fyndes, or taa slyk as he bringes. But specially, I pray thee, hoste dere, Get us som mete and drinke, and make us chere, And we wil payen trewely atte fulle. With empty hand men may na haukes tulle; Lo here our silver, redy for to spende.’ This miller in-to toun his doghter sende For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos, And bond hir hors, it sholde nat gon loos; And in his owne chambre hem made a bed With shetes and with chalons faire y-spred, Noght from his owne bed ten foot or twelve. His doghter hadde a bed, al by hir-selve, Right in the same chambre, by and by; It mighte be no bet, and cause why, Ther was no roumer herberwe in the place. They soupen and they speke, hem to solace, And drinken ever strong ale atte beste. Aboute midnight wente they to reste. Wel hath this miller vernisshed his heed; Ful pale he was for-dronken, and nat reed. He yexeth, and he speketh thurgh the nose As he were on the quakke, or on the pose. To bedde he gooth, and with him goth his wyf. As any Iay she light was and Iolyf, So was hir Ioly whistle wel y-wet. The cradel at hir beddes feet is set, To rokken, and to yeve the child to souke. And whan that dronken al was in the crouke, To bedde went the doghter right anon; To bedde gooth Aleyn and also Iohn; Ther nas na more, hem nedede no dwale. This miller hath so wisly bibbed ale, That as an hors he snorteth in his sleep, Ne of his tayl bihinde he took no keep. His wyf bar him a burdon, a ful strong, Men mighte hir routing here two furlong; The wenche routeth eek par companye. Aleyn the clerk, that herd this melodye, He poked Iohn, and seyde, ‘slepestow? Herdestow ever slyk a sang er now? Lo, whilk a compline is y-mel hem alle! A wilde fyr up-on thair bodyes falle! Wha herkned ever slyk a ferly thing? Ye, they sal have the flour of il ending. This lange night ther tydes me na reste; But yet, na fors; al sal be for the beste. For Iohn,’ seyde he, ‘als ever moot I thryve, If that I may, yon wenche wil I swyve. Som esement has lawe y-shapen us; For Iohn, ther is a lawe that says thus, That gif a man in a point be y-greved, That in another he sal be releved. Our corn is stoln, shortly, it is na nay, And we han had an il fit al this day. And sin I sal have neen amendement, Agayn my los I wil have esement. By goddes saule, it sal neen other be!’ This Iohn answerde, ‘Alayn, avyse thee, The miller is a perilous man,’ he seyde, ‘And gif that he out of his sleep abreyde, He mighte doon us bathe a vileinye.’ Aleyn answerde, ‘I count him nat a flye;’ And up he rist, and by the wenche he crepte. This wenche lay upright, and faste slepte, Til he so ny was, er she mighte espye, That it had been to late for to crye, And shortly for to seyn, they were at on; Now pley, Aleyn! for I wol speke of Iohn. This Iohn lyth stille a furlong-wey or two, And to him-self he maketh routhe and wo: ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘this is a wikked Iape; Now may I seyn that I is but an ape. Yet has my felawe som-what for his harm; He has the milleris doghter in his arm. He auntred him, and has his nedes sped, And I lye as a draf-sek in my bed; And when this Iape is tald another day, I sal been halde a daf, a cokenay! I wil aryse, and auntre it, by my fayth! “Unhardy is unsely,” thus men sayth.’ And up he roos and softely he wente Un-to the cradel, and in his hand it hente, And baar it softe un-to his beddes feet. Sone after this the wyf hir routing leet, And gan awake, and wente hir out to pisse, And cam agayn, and gan hir cradel misse, And groped heer and ther, but she fond noon. ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘I hadde almost misgoon; I hadde almost gon to the clerkes bed. Ey, benedicite! thanne hadde I foule y-sped:’ And forth she gooth til she the cradel fond. She gropeth alwey forther with hir hond, And fond the bed, and thoghte noght but good, By-cause that the cradel by it stood, And niste wher she was, for it was derk; But faire and wel she creep in to the clerk, And lyth ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep. With-inne a whyl this Iohn the clerk up leep, And on this gode wyf he leyth on sore. So mery a fit ne hadde she nat ful yore; He priketh harde and depe as he were mad. This Ioly lyf han thise two clerkes lad Til that the thridde cok bigan to singe. Aleyn wex wery in the daweninge, For he had swonken al the longe night; And seyde, ‘far wel, Malin, swete wight! The day is come, I may no lenger byde; But evermo, wher so I go or ryde, I is thyn awen clerk, swa have I seel!’ ‘Now dere lemman,’ quod she, ‘go, far weel! But er thou go, o thing I wol thee telle, Whan that thou wendest homward by the melle, Right at the entree of the dore bihinde, Thou shalt a cake of half a busshel finde That was y-maked of thyn owne mele, Which that I heelp my fader for to stele. And, gode lemman, god thee save and kepe!’ And with that word almost she gan to wepe. Aleyn up-rist, and thoughte, ‘er that it dawe, I wol go crepen in by my felawe; And fond the cradel with his hand anon, ‘By god,’ thoghte he, ‘al wrang I have misgon; Myn heed is toty of my swink to-night, That maketh me that I go nat aright. I woot wel by the cradel, I have misgo, Heer lyth the miller and his wyf also.’ And forth he goth, a twenty devel way, Un-to the bed ther-as the miller lay. He wende have cropen by his felawe Iohn; And by the miller in he creep anon, And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak: He seyde, ‘thou, Iohn, thou swynes-heed, awak For Cristes saule, and heer a noble game. For by that lord that called is seint Iame, As I have thryes, in this shorte night, Swyved the milleres doghter bolt-upright, Whyl thow hast as a coward been agast.’ ‘Ye, false harlot,’ quod the miller, ‘hast? A! false traitour! false clerk!’ quod he, ‘Thou shalt be deed, by goddes dignitee! Who dorste be so bold to disparage My doghter, that is come of swich linage?’ And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn. And he hente hym despitously agayn, And on the nose he smoot him with his fest. Doun ran the blody streem up-on his brest; And in the floor, with nose and mouth to-broke, They walwe as doon two pigges in a poke. And up they goon, and doun agayn anon, Til that the miller sporned at a stoon, And doun he fil bakward up-on his wyf, That wiste no-thing of this nyce stryf; For she was falle aslepe a lyte wight With Iohn the clerk, that waked hadde al night. And with the fal, out of hir sleep she breyde— ‘Help, holy croys of Bromeholm,’ she seyde, In manus tuas! lord, to thee I calle! Awak, Symond! the feend is on us falle, Myn herte is broken, help, I nam but deed; There lyth oon up my wombe and up myn heed; Help, Simkin, for the false clerkes fighte.’ This Iohn sterte up as faste as ever he mighte, And graspeth by the walles to and fro, To finde a staf; and she sterte up also, And knew the estres bet than dide this Iohn, And by the wal a staf she fond anon, And saugh a litel shimering of a light, For at an hole in shoon the mone bright; And by that light she saugh hem bothe two, But sikerly she niste who was who, But as she saugh a whyt thing in hir yë. And whan she gan the whyte thing espye, She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer. And with the staf she drough ay neer and neer, And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle, And smoot the miller on the pyled skulle, That doun he gooth and cryde, ‘harrow! I dye!’ Thise clerkes bete him weel and lete him lye; And greythen hem, and toke hir hors anon, And eek hir mele, and on hir wey they gon. And at the mille yet they toke hir cake Of half a busshel flour, ful wel y-bake. Thus is the proude miller wel y-bete, And hath y-lost the grinding of the whete, And payed for the soper every-deel Of Aleyn and of Iohn, that bette him weel. His wyf is swyved, and his doghter als; Lo, swich it is a miller to be fals! And therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth, ‘Him thar nat wene wel that yvel dooth; A gylour shal him-self bigyled be.’ And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee, Save al this companye grete and smale! Thus have I quit the miller in my tale. Here is ended the Reves tale. THE COOK'S PROLOGUE. The prologe of the Cokes Tale. The Cook of London, whyl the Reve spak, For Ioye, him thoughte, he clawed him on the bak, ‘Ha! ha!’ quod he, ‘for Cristes passioun, This miller hadde a sharp conclusioun Upon his argument of herbergage! Wel seyde Salomon in his langage, “Ne bringe nat every man in-to thyn hous;” For herberwing by nighte is perilous. Wel oghte a man avysed for to be Whom that he broghte in-to his privetee. I pray to god, so yeve me sorwe and care, If ever, sith I highte Hogge of Ware, Herde I a miller bettre y-set a-werk. He hadde a Iape of malice in the derk. But god forbede that we stinten here; And therfore, if ye vouche-sauf to here A tale of me, that am a povre man, I wol yow telle as wel as ever I can A litel Iape that fil in our citee.’ Our host answerde, and seide, ‘I graunte it thee; Now telle on, Roger, loke that it be good; For many a pastee hastow laten blood, And many a Iakke of Dover hastow sold That hath been twyes hoot and twyes cold. Of many a pilgrim hastow Cristes curs, For of thy persly yet they fare the wors, That they han eten with thy stubbel-goos; For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos. Now telle on, gentil Roger, by thy name. But yet I pray thee, be nat wrooth for game, A man may seye ful sooth in game and pley.’ ‘Thou seist ful sooth,’ quod Roger, ‘by my fey, But “sooth pley, quaad pley,” as the Fleming seith; And ther-fore, Herry Bailly, by thy feith, Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer, Though that my tale be of an hostileer. But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit, But er we parte, y-wis, thou shalt be quit.’ And ther-with-al he lough and made chere, And seyde his tale, as ye shul after here. Thus endeth the Prologe of the Cokes tale. THE COKES TALE. Heer bigynneth the Cokes tale. A prentis whylom dwelled in our citee, And of a craft of vitaillers was he; Gaillard he was as goldfinch in the shawe, Broun as a berie, a propre short felawe, With lokkes blake, y-kempt ful fetisly. Dauncen he coude so wel and Iolily, That he was cleped Perkin Revelour. He was as ful of love and paramour As is the hyve ful of hony swete; Wel was the wenche with him mighte mete. At every brydale wolde he singe and hoppe, He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe. For whan ther any ryding was in Chepe, Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe. Til that he hadde al the sighte y-seyn, And daunced wel, he wolde nat come ageyn. And gadered him a meinee of his sort To hoppe and singe, and maken swich disport. And ther they setten steven for to mete To pleyen at the dys in swich a strete. For in the toune nas ther no prentys, That fairer coude caste a paire of dys Than Perkin coude, and ther-to he was free Of his dispense, in place of privetee. That fond his maister wel in his chaffare; For often tyme he fond his box ful bare. For sikerly a prentis revelour, That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour, His maister shal it in his shoppe abye, Al have he no part of the minstralcye; For thefte and riot, they ben convertible, Al conne he pleye on giterne or ribible. Revel and trouthe, as in a low degree, They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see. This Ioly prentis with his maister bood, Til he were ny out of his prentishood, Al were he snibbed bothe erly and late, And somtyme lad with revel to Newgate; But atte laste his maister him bithoghte, Up-on a day, whan he his paper soghte, Of a proverbe that seith this same word, ‘Wel bet is roten appel out of hord Than that it rotie al the remenaunt.’ So fareth it by a riotous servaunt; It is wel lasse harm to lete him pace, Than he shende alle the servants in the place. Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance, And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance; And thus this Ioly prentis hadde his leve. Now lat him riote al the night or leve. And for ther is no theef with-oute a louke, That helpeth him to wasten and to souke Of that he brybe can or borwe may, Anon he sente his bed and his array Un-to a compeer of his owne sort, That lovede dys and revel and disport, And hadde a wyf that heeld for countenance A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance. Of this Cokes tale maked Chaucer na more. GROUP B. INTRODUCTION TO THE MAN OF LAW'S PROLOGUE. The wordes of the Hoost to the companye. Our Hoste sey wel that the brighte sonne The ark of his artificial day had ronne The fourthe part, and half an houre, and more; And though he were not depe expert in lore, He wiste it was the eightetethe day Of April, that is messager to May; And sey wel that the shadwe of every tree Was as in lengthe the same quantitee That was the body erect that caused it. And therfor by the shadwe he took his wit That Phebus, which that shoon so clere and brighte, Degrees was fyve and fourty clombe on highte; And for that day, as in that latitude, It was ten of the clokke, he gan conclude, And sodeynly he plighte his hors aboute. ‘Lordinges,’ quod he, ‘I warne yow, al this route, The fourthe party of this day is goon; Now, for the love of god and of seint Iohn, Leseth no tyme, as ferforth as ye may; Lordinges, the tyme wasteth night and day, And steleth from us, what prively slepinge, And what thurgh necligence in our wakinge, As dooth the streem, that turneth never agayn, Descending fro the montaigne in-to playn. Wel can Senek, and many a philosophre Biwailen tyme, more than gold in cofre. “For los of catel may recovered be, But los of tyme shendeth us,” quod he. It wol nat come agayn, with-outen drede, Na more than wol Malkins maydenhede, Whan she hath lost it in hir wantownesse; Lat us nat moulen thus in ydelnesse. Sir man of lawe,’ quod he, ‘so have ye blis, Tel us a tale anon, as forward is; Ye been submitted thurgh your free assent To stonde in this cas at my Iugement. Acquiteth yow, and holdeth your biheste, Than have ye doon your devoir atte leste.’ ‘Hoste,’ quod he, ‘depardieux ich assente, To breke forward is not myn entente. Biheste is dette, and I wol holde fayn Al my biheste; I can no better seyn. For swich lawe as man yeveth another wight, He sholde him-selven usen it by right; Thus wol our text; but natheles certeyn I can right now no thrifty tale seyn, But Chaucer, though he can but lewedly On metres and on ryming craftily, Hath seyd hem in swich English as he can Of olde tyme, as knoweth many a man. And if he have not seyd hem, leve brother, In o book, he hath seyd hem in another. For he hath told of loveres up and doun Mo than Ovyde made of mencioun In his Epistelles, that been ful olde. What sholde I tellen hem, sin they ben tolde? In youthe he made of Ceys and Alcion, And sithen hath he spoke of everichon, Thise noble wyves and thise loveres eke. Who-so that wol his large volume seke Cleped the Seintes Legende of Cupyde, Ther may he seen the large woundes wyde Of Lucresse, and of Babilan Tisbee; The swerd of Dido for the false Enee; The tree of Phillis for hir Demophon; The pleinte of Dianire and Hermion, Of Adriane and of Isiphilee; The bareyne yle stonding in the see; The dreynte Leander for his Erro; The teres of Eleyne, and eek the wo Of Brixseyde, and of thee, Ladomëa; The crueltee of thee, queen Medëa, Thy litel children hanging by the hals For thy Iason, that was of love so fals! O Ypermistra, Penelopee, Alceste, Your wyfhod he comendeth with the beste! But certeinly no word ne wryteth he Of thilke wikke ensample of Canacee, That lovede hir owne brother sinfully; Of swiche cursed stories I sey ‘fy’; Or elles of Tyro Apollonius, How that the cursed king Antiochus Birafte his doghter of hir maydenhede, That is so horrible a tale for to rede, Whan he hir threw up-on the pavement. And therfor he, of ful avysement, Nolde never wryte in none of his sermouns Of swiche unkinde abhominaciouns, Ne I wol noon reherse, if that I may. But of my tale how shal I doon this day? Me were looth be lykned, doutelees, To Muses that men clepe Pierides— Metamorphoseos wot what I mene:— But nathelees, I recche noght a bene Though I come after him with hawe-bake; I speke in prose, and lat him rymes make.’ And with that word he, with a sobre chere, Bigan his tale, as ye shal after here. The Prologe of the Mannes Tale of Lawe. O hateful harm! condicion of poverte! With thurst, with cold, with hunger so confounded! To asken help thee shameth in thyn herte; If thou noon aske, with nede artow so wounded, That verray nede unwrappeth al thy wounde hid! Maugree thyn heed, thou most for indigence Or stele, or begge, or borwe thy despence! Thou blamest Crist, and seyst ful bitterly, He misdeparteth richesse temporal; Thy neighebour thou wytest sinfully, And seyst thou hast to lyte, and he hath al. ‘Parfay,’ seistow, ‘somtyme he rekne shal, Whan that his tayl shal brennen in the glede, For he noght helpeth needfulle in hir nede.’ Herkne what is the sentence of the wyse:— ‘Bet is to dyën than have indigence;’ ‘Thy selve neighebour wol thee despyse;’ If thou be povre, farwel thy reverence! Yet of the wyse man tak this sentence:— ‘Alle the dayes of povre men ben wikke;’ Be war therfor, er thou come in that prikke! ‘If thou be povre, thy brother hateth thee, And alle thy freendes fleen fro thee, alas!’ O riche marchaunts, ful of wele ben ye, O noble, o prudent folk, as in this cas! Your bagges been nat filled with ambes as, But with sis cink, than renneth for your chaunce; At Cristemasse merie may ye daunce! Ye seken lond and see for your winninges, As wyse folk ye knowen al thestaat Of regnes; ye ben fadres of tydinges And tales, bothe of pees and of debat. I were right now of tales desolat, Nere that a marchaunt, goon is many a yere, Me taughte a tale, which that ye shal here. THE TALE OF THE MAN OF LAWE. Here beginneth the Man of Lawe his Tale. In Surrie whylom dwelte a companye Of chapmen riche, and therto sadde and trewe, That wyde-wher senten her spycerye, Clothes of gold, and satins riche of hewe; Her chaffar was so thrifty and so newe, That every wight hath deyntee to chaffare With hem, and eek to sellen hem hir ware. Now fel it, that the maistres of that sort Han shapen hem to Rome for to wende; Were it for chapmanhode or for disport, Non other message wolde they thider sende, But comen hem-self to Rome, this is the ende; And in swich place, as thoughte hem avantage For her entente, they take her herbergage. Soiourned han thise marchants in that toun A certein tyme, as fel to hir plesance. And so bifel, that thexcellent renoun Of themperoures doghter, dame Custance, Reported was, with every circumstance, Un-to thise Surrien marchants in swich wyse, Fro day to day, as I shal yow devyse. This was the commune vois of every man— ‘Our Emperour of Rome, god him see, A doghter hath that, sin the world bigan, To rekne as wel hir goodnesse as beautee, Nas never swich another as is she; I prey to god in honour hir sustene, And wolde she were of al Europe the quene. In hir is heigh beautee, with-oute pryde, Yowthe, with-oute grenehede or folye; To alle hir werkes vertu is hir gyde, Humblesse hath slayn in hir al tirannye. She is mirour of alle curteisye; Hir herte is verray chambre of holinesse, Hir hand, ministre of fredom for almesse.’ And al this vois was soth, as god is trewe, But now to purpos lat us turne agayn; Thise marchants han doon fraught hir shippes newe, And, whan they han this blisful mayden seyn, Hoom to Surryë been they went ful fayn, And doon her nedes as they han don yore, And liven in wele; I can sey yow no more. Now fel it, that thise marchants stode in grace Of him, that was the sowdan of Surrye; For whan they came from any strange place, He wolde, of his benigne curteisye, Make hem good chere, and bisily espye Tydings of sondry regnes, for to lere The wondres that they mighte seen or here. Amonges othere thinges, specially Thise marchants han him told of dame Custance, So gret noblesse in ernest, ceriously, That this sowdan hath caught so gret plesance To han hir figure in his remembrance, That al his lust and al his bisy cure Was for to love hir whyl his lyf may dure. Paraventure in thilke large book Which that men clepe the heven, y-writen was With sterres, whan that he his birthe took, That he for love shulde han his deeth, allas! For in the sterres, clerer than is glas, Is writen, god wot, who-so coude it rede, The deeth of every man, withouten drede. In sterres, many a winter ther-biforn, Was writen the deeth of Ector, Achilles, Of Pompey, Iulius, er they were born; The stryf of Thebes; and of Ercules, Of Sampson, Turnus, and of Socrates The deeth; but mennes wittes been so dulle, That no wight can wel rede it atte fulle. This sowdan for his privee conseil sente, And, shortly of this mater for to pace, He hath to hem declared his entente, And seyde hem certein, ‘but he mighte have grace To han Custance with-inne a litel space, He nas but deed;’ and charged hem, in hye, To shapen for his lyf som remedye. Diverse men diverse thinges seyden; They argumenten, casten up and doun; Many a subtil resoun forth they leyden, They speken of magik and abusioun; But finally, as in conclusioun, They can not seen in that non avantage, Ne in non other wey, save mariage. Than sawe they ther-in swich difficultee By wey of resoun, for to speke al playn, By-cause that ther was swich diversitee Bitwene hir bothe lawes, that they sayn, They trowe ‘that no cristen prince wolde fayn Wedden his child under oure lawes swete That us were taught by Mahoun our prophete.’ And he answerde, ‘rather than I lese Custance, I wol be cristned doutelees; I mot ben hires, I may non other chese. I prey yow holde your arguments in pees; Saveth my lyf, and beeth noght recchelees To geten hir that hath my lyf in cure; For in this wo I may not longe endure.’ What nedeth gretter dilatacioun? I seye, by tretis and embassadrye, And by the popes mediacioun, And al the chirche, and al the chivalrye, That, in destruccioun of Maumetrye, And in encrees of Cristes lawe dere, They ben acorded, so as ye shal here; How that the sowdan and his baronage And alle his liges shulde y-cristned be, And he shal han Custance in mariage, And certein gold, I noot what quantitee, And her-to founden suffisant seurtee; This same acord was sworn on eyther syde; Now, faire Custance, almighty god thee gyde! Now wolde som men waiten, as I gesse, That I shulde tellen al the purveyance That themperour, of his grete noblesse, Hath shapen for his doghter dame Custance. Wel may men knowe that so gret ordinance May no man tellen in a litel clause As was arrayed for so heigh a cause. Bisshopes ben shapen with hir for to wende, Lordes, ladyes, knightes of renoun, And other folk y-nowe, this is the ende; And notifyed is thurgh-out the toun That every wight, with gret devocioun, Shulde preyen Crist that he this mariage Receyve in gree, and spede this viage. The day is comen of hir departinge, I sey, the woful day fatal is come, That ther may be no lenger taryinge, But forthward they hem dressen, alle and some; Custance, that was with sorwe al overcome, Ful pale arist, and dresseth hir to wende; For wel she seeth ther is non other ende. Allas! what wonder is it though she wepte, That shal be sent to strange nacioun Fro freendes, that so tendrely hir kepte, And to be bounden under subieccioun Of oon, she knoweth not his condicioun. Housbondes been alle gode, and han ben yore, That knowen wyves, I dar say yow no more. ‘Fader,’ she sayde, ‘thy wrecched child Custance, Thy yonge doghter, fostred up so softe, And ye, my moder, my soverayn plesance Over alle thing, out-taken Crist on-lofte, Custance, your child, hir recomandeth ofte Un-to your grace, for I shal to Surryë, Ne shal I never seen yow more with yë. Allas! un-to the Barbre nacioun I moste anon, sin that it is your wille; But Crist, that starf for our redempcioun, So yeve me grace, his hestes to fulfille; I, wrecche womman, no fors though I spille. Wommen are born to thraldom and penance, And to ben under mannes governance.’ I trowe, at Troye, whan Pirrus brak the wal Or Ylion brende, at Thebes the citee, Nat Rome, for the harm thurgh Hanibal That Romayns hath venquisshed tymes thre, Nas herd swich tendre weping for pitee As in the chambre was for hir departinge; Bot forth she moot, wher-so she wepe or singe. O firste moevyng cruel firmament, With thy diurnal sweigh that crowdest ay And hurlest al from Est til Occident, That naturelly wolde holde another way, Thy crowding set the heven in swich array At the beginning of this fiers viage, That cruel Mars hath slayn this mariage. Infortunat ascendent tortuous, Of which the lord is helples falle, allas! Out of his angel in-to the derkest hous. O Mars, O Atazir, as in this cas! O feble mone, unhappy been thy pas! Thou knittest thee ther thou art nat receyved, Ther thou were weel, fro thennes artow weyved. Imprudent emperour of Rome, allas! Was ther no philosophre in al thy toun? Is no tyme bet than other in swich cas? Of viage is ther noon eleccioun, Namely to folk of heigh condicioun, Nat whan a rote is of a birthe y-knowe? Allas! we ben to lewed or to slowe. To shippe is brought this woful faire mayde Solempnely, with every circumstance. ‘Now Iesu Crist be with yow alle,’ she sayde; Ther nis namore but ‘farewel! faire Custance!’ She peyneth hir to make good countenance, And forth I lete hir sayle in this manere, And turne I wol agayn to my matere. The moder of the sowdan, welle of vyces, Espyëd hath hir sones pleyn entente, How he wol lete his olde sacrifyces, And right anon she for hir conseil sente; And they ben come, to knowe what she mente. And when assembled was this folk in-fere, She sette hir doun, and sayde as ye shal here. ‘Lordes,’ quod she, ‘ye knowen everichon, How that my sone in point is for to lete The holy lawes of our Alkaron, Yeven by goddes message Makomete. But oon avow to grete god I hete, The lyf shal rather out of my body sterte Than Makometes lawe out of myn herte! What shulde us tyden of this newe lawe But thraldom to our bodies and penance? And afterward in helle to be drawe For we reneyed Mahoun our creance? But, lordes, wol ye maken assurance, As I shal seyn, assenting to my lore, And I shall make us sauf for evermore?’ They sworen and assenten, every man, To live with hir and dye, and by hir stonde; And everich, in the beste wyse he can, To strengthen hir shal alle his freendes fonde; And she hath this empryse y-take on honde, Which ye shal heren that I shal devyse, And to hem alle she spak right in this wyse. ‘We shul first feyne us cristendom to take, Cold water shal not greve us but a lyte; And I shal swich a feste and revel make, That, as I trowe, I shal the sowdan quyte. For though his wyf be cristned never so whyte, She shal have nede to wasshe awey the rede, Thogh she a font-ful water with hir lede.’ O sowdanesse, rote of iniquitee, Virago, thou Semyram the secounde, O serpent under femininitee, Lyk to the serpent depe in helle y-bounde, O feyned womman, al that may confounde Vertu and innocence, thurgh thy malyce, Is bred in thee, as nest of every vyce! O Satan, envious sin thilke day That thou were chased from our heritage, Wel knowestow to wommen the olde way! Thou madest Eva bringe us in servage. Thou wolt fordoon this cristen mariage. Thyn instrument so, weylawey the whyle! Makestow of wommen, whan thou wolt begyle. This sowdanesse, whom I thus blame and warie, Leet prively hir conseil goon hir way. What sholde I in this tale lenger tarie? She rydeth to the sowdan on a day, And seyde him, that she wolde reneye hir lay, And cristendom of preestes handes fonge, Repenting hir she hethen was so longe, Biseching him to doon hir that honour, That she moste han the cristen men to feste; ‘To plesen hem I wol do my labour.’ The sowdan seith, ‘I wol don at your heste,’ And kneling thanketh hir of that requeste. So glad he was, he niste what to seye; She kiste hir sone, and hoom she gooth hir weye. Explicit prima pars. Sequitur pars secunda. Arryved ben this cristen folk to londe, In Surrie, with a greet solempne route, And hastily this sowdan sente his sonde, First to his moder, and al the regne aboute, And seyde, his wyf was comen, out of doute, And preyde hir for to ryde agayn the quene, The honour of his regne to sustene. Gret was the prees, and riche was tharray Of Surriens and Romayns met y-fere; The moder of the sowdan, riche and gay, Receyveth hir with al-so glad a chere As any moder mighte hir doghter dere, And to the nexte citee ther bisyde A softe pas solempnely they ryde. Noght trowe I the triumphe of Iulius, Of which that Lucan maketh swich a bost, Was royaller, ne more curious Than was thassemblee of this blisful host. But this scorpioun, this wikked gost, The sowdanesse, for al hir flateringe, Caste under this ful mortally to stinge. The sowdan comth him-self sone after this So royally, that wonder is to telle, And welcometh hir with alle Ioye and blis. And thus in merthe and Ioye I lete hem dwelle. The fruyt of this matere is that I telle. Whan tyme cam, men thoughte it for the beste That revel stinte, and men goon to hir reste. The tyme cam, this olde sowdanesse Ordeyned hath this feste of which I tolde, And to the feste cristen folk hem dresse In general, ye! bothe yonge and olde. Here may men feste and royaltee biholde, And deyntees mo than I can yow devyse, But al to dere they boughte it er they ryse. O sodeyn wo! that ever art successour To worldly blisse, spreynd with bitternesse; Thende of the Ioye of our worldly labour; Wo occupieth the fyn of our gladnesse. Herke this conseil for thy sikernesse, Up-on thy glade day have in thy minde The unwar wo or harm that comth bihinde. For shortly for to tellen at o word, The sowdan and the cristen everichone Ben al to-hewe and stiked at the bord, But it were only dame Custance allone. This olde sowdanesse, cursed crone, Hath with hir frendes doon this cursed dede, For she hir-self wolde al the contree lede. Ne ther was Surrien noon that was converted That of the conseil of the sowdan woot, That he nas al to-hewe er he asterted. And Custance han they take anon, foot-hoot, And in a shippe al sterelees, god woot, They han hir set, and bidde hir lerne sayle Out of Surrye agaynward to Itayle. A certein tresor that she thider ladde, And, sooth to sayn, vitaille gret plentee They han hir yeven, and clothes eek she hadde, And forth she sayleth in the salte see. O my Custance, ful of benignitee, O emperoures yonge doghter dere, He that is lord of fortune be thy stere! She blesseth hir, and with ful pitous voys Un-to the croys of Crist thus seyde she, ‘O clere, o welful auter, holy croys, Reed of the lambes blood full of pitee, That wesh the world fro the olde iniquitee, Me fro the feend, and fro his clawes kepe, That day that I shal drenchen in the depe. Victorious tree, proteccioun of trewe, That only worthy were for to bere The king of heven with his woundes newe, The whyte lamb, that hurt was with the spere, Flemer of feendes out of him and here On which thy limes feithfully extenden, Me keep, and yif me might my lyf tamenden.’ Yeres and dayes fleet this creature Thurghout the see of Grece un-to the strayte Of Marrok, as it was hir aventure; On many a sory meel now may she bayte; After her deeth ful often may she wayte, Er that the wilde wawes wole hir dryve Un-to the place, ther she shal arryve. Men mighten asken why she was not slayn? Eek at the feste who mighte hir body save? And I answere to that demaunde agayn, Who saved Daniel in the horrible cave, Ther every wight save he, maister and knave, Was with the leoun frete er he asterte? No wight but god, that he bar in his herte. God liste to shewe his wonderful miracle In hir, for we sholde seen his mighty werkes; Crist, which that is to every harm triacle, By certein menes ofte, as knowen clerkes, Doth thing for certein ende that ful derk is To mannes wit, that for our ignorance Ne conne not knowe his prudent purveyance. Now, sith she was not at the feste y-slawe, Who kepte hir fro the drenching in the see? Who kepte Ionas in the fisshes mawe Til he was spouted up at Ninivee? Wel may men knowe it was no wight but he That kepte peple Ebraik fro hir drenchinge, With drye feet thurgh-out the see passinge. Who bad the foure spirits of tempest, That power han tanoyen land and see, ‘Bothe north and south, and also west and est, Anoyeth neither see, ne land, ne tree?’ Sothly, the comaundour of that was he, That fro the tempest ay this womman kepte As wel whan [that] she wook as whan she slepte. Wher mighte this womman mete and drinke have? Three yeer and more how lasteth hir vitaille? Who fedde the Egipcien Marie in the cave, Or in desert? no wight but Crist, sans faille. Fyve thousand folk it was as gret mervaille With loves fyve and fisshes two to fede. God sente his foison at hir grete nede. She dryveth forth in-to our occean Thurgh-out our wilde see, til, atte laste, Under an hold that nempnen I ne can, Fer in Northumberlond the wawe hir caste, And in the sond hir ship stiked so faste, That thennes wolde it noght of al a tyde, The wille of Crist was that she shulde abyde. The constable of the castel doun is fare To seen this wrak, and al the ship he soghte, And fond this wery womman ful of care; He fond also the tresor that she broghte. In hir langage mercy she bisoghte The lyf out of hir body for to twinne, Hir to delivere of wo that she was inne. A maner Latin corrupt was hir speche, But algates ther-by was she understonde; The constable, whan him list no lenger seche, This woful womman broghte he to the londe; She kneleth doun, and thanketh goddes sonde. But what she was, she wolde no man seye, For foul ne fair, thogh that she shulde deye. She seyde, she was so mased in the see That she forgat hir minde, by hir trouthe; The constable hath of hir so greet pitee, And eek his wyf, that they wepen for routhe, She was so diligent, with-outen slouthe, To serve and plesen everich in that place, That alle hir loven that loken on hir face. This constable and dame Hermengild his wyf Were payens, and that contree every-where; But Hermengild lovede hir right as hir lyf, And Custance hath so longe soiourned there, In orisons, with many a bitter tere, Til Iesu hath converted thurgh his grace Dame Hermengild, constablesse of that place. In al that lond no Cristen durste route, Alle Cristen folk ben fled fro that contree Thurgh payens, that conquereden al aboute The plages of the North, by land and see; To Walis fled the Cristianitee Of olde Britons, dwellinge in this yle; Ther was hir refut for the mene whyle. But yet nere Cristen Britons so exyled That ther nere somme that in hir privetee Honoured Crist, and hethen folk bigyled; And ny the castel swiche ther dwelten three. That oon of hem was blind, and mighte nat see But it were with thilke yën of his minde, With whiche men seen, after that they ben blinde. Bright was the sonne as in that someres day, For which the constable and his wyf also And Custance han y-take the righte way Toward the see, a furlong wey or two, To pleyen and to romen to and fro; And in hir walk this blinde man they mette Croked and old, with yën faste y-shette. ‘In name of Crist,’ cryde this blinde Britoun, ‘Dame Hermengild, yif me my sighte agayn.’ This lady wex affrayed of the soun, Lest that hir housbond, shortly for to sayn, Wolde hir for Iesu Cristes love han slayn, Til Custance made hir bold, and bad hir werche The wil of Crist, as doghter of his chirche. The constable wex abasshed of that sight, And seyde, ‘what amounteth al this fare?’ Custance answerde, ‘sire, it is Cristes might, That helpeth folk out of the feendes snare.’ And so ferforth she gan our lay declare, That she the constable, er that it were eve, Converted, and on Crist made him bileve. This constable was no-thing lord of this place Of which I speke, ther he Custance fond, But kepte it strongly, many wintres space, Under Alla, king of al Northumberlond, That was ful wys, and worthy of his hond Agayn the Scottes, as men may wel here, But turne I wol agayn to my matere. Sathan, that ever us waiteth to bigyle, Saugh of Custance al hir perfeccioun, And caste anon how he mighte quyte hir whyle, And made a yong knight, that dwelte in that toun, Love hir so hote, of foul affeccioun, That verraily him thoughte he shulde spille But he of hir mighte ones have his wille. He woweth hir, but it availleth noght, She wolde do no sinne, by no weye; And, for despyt, he compassed in his thoght To maken hir on shamful deth to deye. He wayteth whan the constable was aweye, And prively, up-on a night, he crepte In Hermengildes chambre whyl she slepte. Wery, for-waked in her orisouns, Slepeth Custance, and Hermengild also. This knight, thurgh Sathanas temptaciouns, Al softely is to the bed y-go, And kitte the throte of Hermengild a-two, And leyde the blody knyf by dame Custance, And wente his wey, ther god yeve him meschance! Sone after comth this constable hoom agayn, And eek Alla, that king was of that lond, And saugh his wyf despitously y-slayn, For which ful ofte he weep and wrong his hond, And in the bed the blody knyf he fond By dame Custance; allas! what mighte she seye? For verray wo hir wit was al aweye. To king Alla was told al this meschance, And eek the tyme, and where, and in what wyse That in a ship was founden dame Custance, As heer-biforn that ye han herd devyse. The kinges herte of pitee gan agryse, Whan he saugh so benigne a creature Falle in disese and in misaventure. For as the lomb toward his deeth is broght, So stant this innocent bifore the king; This false knight that hath this tresoun wroght Berth hir on hond that she hath doon this thing. But nathelees, ther was greet moorning Among the peple, and seyn, ‘they can not gesse That she hath doon so greet a wikkednesse. For they han seyn hir ever so vertuous, And loving Hermengild right as her lyf.’ Of this bar witnesse everich in that hous Save he that Hermengild slow with his knyf. This gentil king hath caught a gret motyf Of this witnesse, and thoghte he wolde enquere Depper in this, a trouthe for to lere. Allas! Custance! thou hast no champioun, Ne fighte canstow nought, so weylawey! But he, that starf for our redempcioun And bond Sathan (and yit lyth ther he lay) So be thy stronge champioun this day! For, but-if Crist open miracle kythe, Withouten gilt thou shalt be slayn as swythe. She sette her doun on knees, and thus she sayde, ‘Immortal god, that savedest Susanne Fro false blame, and thou, merciful mayde, Mary I mene, doghter to Seint Anne, Bifore whos child aungeles singe Osanne, If I be giltlees of this felonye, My socour be, for elles I shal dye!’ Have ye nat seyn som tyme a pale face, Among a prees, of him that hath be lad Toward his deeth, wher-as him gat no grace, And swich a colour in his face hath had, Men mighte knowe his face, that was bistad, Amonges alle the faces in that route: So stant Custance, and loketh hir aboute. O quenes, livinge in prosperitee, Duchesses, and ye ladies everichone, Haveth som routhe on hir adversitee; An emperoures doghter stant allone; She hath no wight to whom to make hir mone. O blood royal, that stondest in this drede, Fer ben thy freendes at thy grete nede! This Alla king hath swich compassioun, As gentil herte is fulfild of pitee, That from his yën ran the water doun. ‘Now hastily do fecche a book,’ quod he, ‘And if this knight wol sweren how that she This womman slow, yet wole we us avyse Whom that we wole that shal ben our Iustyse.’ A Briton book, writen with Evangyles, Was fet, and on this book he swoor anoon She gilty was, and in the mene whyles A hand him smoot upon the nekke-boon, That doun he fil atones as a stoon, And bothe his yën broste out of his face In sight of every body in that place. A vois was herd in general audience, And seyde, ‘thou hast desclaundred giltelees The doghter of holy chirche in hey presence; Thus hastou doon, and yet holde I my pees.’ Of this mervaille agast was al the prees; As mased folk they stoden everichone, For drede of wreche, save Custance allone. Greet was the drede and eek the repentance Of hem that hadden wrong suspeccioun Upon this sely innocent Custance; And, for this miracle, in conclusioun, And by Custances mediacioun, The king, and many another in that place, Converted was, thanked be Cristes grace! This false knight was slayn for his untrouthe By Iugement of Alla hastifly; And yet Custance hadde of his deeth gret routhe. And after this Iesus, of his mercy, Made Alla wedden ful solempnely This holy mayden, that is so bright and shene, And thus hath Crist y-maad Custance a quene. But who was woful, if I shal nat lye, Of this wedding but Donegild, and na mo, The kinges moder, ful of tirannye? Hir thoughte hir cursed herte brast a-two; She wolde noght hir sone had do so; Hir thoughte a despit, that he sholde take So strange a creature un-to his make. Me list nat of the chaf nor of the stree Maken so long a tale, as of the corn. What sholde I tellen of the royaltee At mariage, or which cours gooth biforn, Who bloweth in a trompe or in an horn? The fruit of every tale is for to seye; They ete, and drinke, and daunce, and singe, and pleye. They goon to bedde, as it was skile and right; For, thogh that wyves been ful holy thinges, They moste take in pacience at night Swich maner necessaries as been plesinges To folk that han y-wedded hem with ringes, And leye a lyte hir holinesse asyde As for the tyme; it may no bet bityde. On hir he gat a knave-child anoon, And to a bishop and his constable eke He took his wyf to kepe, whan he is goon To Scotland-ward, his fo-men for to seke; Now faire Custance, that is so humble and meke, So longe is goon with childe, til that stille She halt hir chambre, abyding Cristes wille. The tyme is come, a knave-child she ber; Mauricius at the font-stoon they him calle; This Constable dooth forth come a messager, And wroot un-to his king, that cleped was Alle, How that this blisful tyding is bifalle, And othere tydings speedful for to seye; He takth the lettre, and forth he gooth his weye. This messager, to doon his avantage, Un-to the kinges moder rydeth swythe, And salueth hir ful faire in his langage, ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘ye may be glad and blythe, And thanke god an hundred thousand sythe; My lady quene hath child, with-outen doute, To Ioye and blisse of al this regne aboute. Lo, heer the lettres seled of this thing, That I mot bere with al the haste I may; If ye wol aught un-to your sone the king, I am your servant, bothe night and day.’ Donegild answerde, ‘as now at this tyme, nay; But heer al night I wol thou take thy reste, Tomorwe wol I seye thee what me leste.’ This messager drank sadly ale and wyn, And stolen were his lettres prively Out of his box, whyl he sleep as a swyn; And countrefeted was ful subtilly Another lettre, wroght ful sinfully, Un-to the king direct of this matere Fro his constable, as ye shul after here. The lettre spak, ‘the queen delivered was Of so horrible a feendly creature, That in the castel noon so hardy was That any whyle dorste ther endure. The moder was an elf, by aventure Y-come, by charmes or by sorcerye, And every wight hateth hir companye.’ Wo was this king whan he this lettre had seyn, But to no wighte he tolde his sorwes sore, But of his owene honde he wroot ageyn, ‘Welcome the sonde of Crist for evermore To me, that am now lerned in his lore; Lord, welcome be thy lust and thy plesaunce, My lust I putte al in thyn ordinaunce! Kepeth this child, al be it foul or fair, And eek my wyf, un-to myn hoom-cominge; Crist, whan him list, may sende me an heir More agreable than this to my lykinge.’ This lettre he seleth, prively wepinge, Which to the messager was take sone, And forth he gooth; ther is na more to done. O messager, fulfild of dronkenesse, Strong is thy breeth, thy limes faltren ay, And thou biwreyest alle secreenesse. Thy mind is lorn, thou Ianglest as a Iay, Thy face is turned in a newe array! Ther dronkenesse regneth in any route, Ther is no conseil hid, with-outen doute. O Donegild, I ne have noon English digne Un-to thy malice and thy tirannye! And therfor to the feend I thee resigne, Let him endyten of thy traitorye! Fy, mannish, fy! o nay, by god, I lye, Fy, feendly spirit, for I dar wel telle, Though thou heer walke, thy spirit is in helle! This messager comth fro the king agayn, And at the kinges modres court he lighte, And she was of this messager ful fayn, And plesed him in al that ever she mighte. He drank, and wel his girdel underpighte. He slepeth, and he snoreth in his gyse Al night, un-til the sonne gan aryse. Eft were his lettres stolen everichon And countrefeted lettres in this wyse; ‘The king comandeth his constable anon, Up peyne of hanging, and on heigh Iuÿse, That he ne sholde suffren in no wyse Custance in-with his regne for tabyde Thre dayes and a quarter of a tyde; But in the same ship as he hir fond, Hir and hir yonge sone, and al hir gere, He sholde putte, and croude hir fro the lond, And charge hir that she never eft come there.’ O my Custance, wel may thy goost have fere And sleping in thy dreem been in penance, When Donegild caste al this ordinance! This messager on morwe, whan he wook, Un-to the castel halt the nexte wey, And to the constable he the lettre took; And whan that he this pitous lettre sey, Ful ofte he seyde ‘allas!’ and ‘weylawey!’ ‘Lord Crist,’ quod he, ‘how may this world endure? So ful of sinne is many a creature! O mighty god, if that it be thy wille, Sith thou art rightful Iuge, how may it be That thou wolt suffren innocents to spille, And wikked folk regne in prosperitee? O good Custance, allas! so wo is me That I mot be thy tormentour, or deye On shames deeth; ther is noon other weye!’ Wepen bothe yonge and olde in al that place, Whan that the king this cursed lettre sente, And Custance, with a deedly pale face, The ferthe day toward hir ship she wente. But natheles she taketh in good entente The wille of Crist, and, kneling on the stronde, She seyde, ‘lord! ay wel-com be thy sonde! He that me kepte fro the false blame Whyl I was on the londe amonges yow, He can me kepe from harme and eek fro shame In salte see, al-thogh I se nat how. As strong as ever he was, he is yet now. In him triste I, and in his moder dere, That is to me my seyl and eek my stere.’ Hir litel child lay weping in hir arm, And kneling, pitously to him she seyde, ‘Pees, litel sone, I wol do thee non harm.’ With that hir kerchef of hir heed she breyde, And over his litel yën she it leyde; And in hir arm she lulleth it ful faste, And in-to heven hir yën up she caste. ‘Moder,’ quod she, ‘and mayde bright, Marye, Sooth is that thurgh wommannes eggement Mankind was lorn and damned ay to dye, For which thy child was on a croys y-rent; Thy blisful yën sawe al his torment; Than is ther no comparisoun bitwene Thy wo and any wo man may sustene. Thou sawe thy child y-slayn bifor thyn yën, And yet now liveth my litel child, parfay! Now, lady bright, to whom alle woful cryën, Thou glorie of wommanhede, thou faire may, Thou haven of refut, brighte sterre of day, Rewe on my child, that of thy gentillesse Rewest on every rewful in distresse! O litel child, allas! what is thy gilt, That never wroughtest sinne as yet, pardee, Why wil thyn harde fader han thee spilt? O mercy, dere Constable!’ quod she; ‘As lat my litel child dwelle heer with thee; And if thou darst not saven him, for blame, So kis him ones in his fadres name!’ Ther-with she loketh bakward to the londe, And seyde, ‘far-wel, housbond routhelees!’ And up she rist, and walketh doun the stronde Toward the ship; hir folweth al the prees, And ever she preyeth hir child to holde his pees; And taketh hir leve, and with an holy entente She blesseth hir; and in-to ship she wente. Vitailled was the ship, it is no drede, Habundantly for hir, ful longe space, And other necessaries that sholde nede She hadde y-nogh, heried be goddes grace! For wind and weder almighty god purchace, And bringe hir hoom! I can no bettre seye; But in the see she dryveth forth hir weye. Explicit secunda pars. Sequitur pars tercia. Alla the king comth hoom, sone after this, Unto his castel of the which I tolde, And axeth wher his wyf and his child is. The constable gan aboute his herte colde, And pleynly al the maner he him tolde As ye han herd, I can telle it no bettre, And sheweth the king his seel and [eek] his lettre, And seyde, ‘lord, as ye comaunded me Up peyne of deeth, so have I doon, certein.’ This messager tormented was til he Moste biknowe and tellen, plat and plein, Fro night to night, in what place he had leyn. And thus, by wit and subtil enqueringe, Ymagined was by whom this harm gan springe. The hand was knowe that the lettre wroot, And al the venim of this cursed dede, But in what wyse, certeinly I noot. Theffect is this, that Alla, out of drede, His moder slow, that men may pleinly rede, For that she traitour was to hir ligeaunce. Thus endeth olde Donegild with meschaunce. The sorwe that this Alla, night and day, Maketh for his wyf and for his child also, Ther is no tonge that it telle may. But now wol I un-to Custance go, That fleteth in the see, in peyne and wo, Fyve yeer and more, as lyked Cristes sonde, Er that hir ship approched un-to londe. Under an hethen castel, atte laste, Of which the name in my text noght I finde, Custance and eek hir child the see up-caste. Almighty god, that saveth al mankinde, Have on Custance and on hir child som minde, That fallen is in hethen land eft-sone, In point to spille, as I shal telle yow sone. Doun from the castel comth ther many a wight To gauren on this ship and on Custance. But shortly, from the castel, on a night, The lordes styward—god yeve him meschaunce!— A theef, that had reneyed our creaunce, Com in-to ship allone, and seyde he sholde Hir lemman be, wher-so she wolde or nolde. Wo was this wrecched womman tho bigon, Hir child cryde, and she cryde pitously; But blisful Marie heelp hir right anon; For with hir strugling wel and mightily The theef fil over bord al sodeinly, And in the see he dreynte for vengeance; And thus hath Crist unwemmed kept Custance. O foule lust of luxurie! lo, thyn ende! Auctor. Nat only that thou feyntest mannes minde, But verraily thou wolt his body shende; Thende of thy werk or of thy lustes blinde Is compleyning, how many-oon may men finde That noght for werk som-tyme, but for thentente To doon this sinne, ben outher sleyn or shente! How may this wayke womman han this strengthe Hir to defende agayn this renegat? O Golias, unmesurable of lengthe, How mighte David make thee so mat, So yong and of armure so desolat? How dorste he loke up-on thy dredful face? Wel may men seen, it nas but goddes grace! Who yaf Iudith corage or hardinesse To sleen him, Olofernus, in his tente, And to deliveren out of wrecchednesse The peple of god? I seye, for this entente, That, right as god spirit of vigour sente To hem, and saved hem out of meschance, So sente he might and vigour to Custance. Forth goth hir ship thurgh-out the narwe mouth Of Iubaltar and Septe, dryving ay, Som-tyme West, som-tyme North and South, And som-tyme Est, ful many a wery day, Til Cristes moder (blessed be she ay!) Hath shapen, thurgh hir endelees goodnesse, To make an ende of al hir hevinesse. Now lat us stinte of Custance but a throwe, And speke we of the Romain Emperour, That out of Surrie hath by lettres knowe The slaughtre of cristen folk, and dishonour Don to his doghter by a fals traitour, I mene the cursed wikked sowdanesse, That at the feste leet sleen both more and lesse. For which this emperour hath sent anoon His senatour, with royal ordinance, And othere lordes, got wot, many oon, On Surriens to taken heigh vengeance. They brennen, sleen, and bringe hem to meschance Ful many a day; but shortly, this is thende, Homward to Rome they shapen hem to wende. This senatour repaireth with victorie To Rome-ward, sayling ful royally, And mette the ship dryving, as seith the storie, In which Custance sit ful pitously. No-thing ne knew he what she was, ne why She was in swich array; ne she nil seye Of hir estaat, althogh she sholde deye. He bringeth hir to Rome, and to his wyf He yaf hir, and hir yonge sone also; And with the senatour she ladde her lyf. Thus can our lady bringen out of wo Woful Custance, and many another mo. And longe tyme dwelled she in that place, In holy werkes ever, as was hir grace. The senatoures wyf hir aunte was, But for al that she knew hir never the more; I wol no lenger tarien in this cas, But to king Alla, which I spak of yore, That for his wyf wepeth and syketh sore, I wol retourne, and lete I wol Custance Under the senatoures governance. King Alla, which that hadde his moder slayn, Upon a day fil in swich repentance, That, if I shortly tellen shal and plain, To Rome he comth, to receyven his penance; And putte him in the popes ordinance In heigh and low, and Iesu Crist bisoghte Foryeve his wikked werkes that he wroghte. The fame anon thurgh Rome toun is born, How Alla king shal come in pilgrimage, By herbergeours that wenten him biforn; For which the senatour, as was usage, Rood him ageyn, and many of his linage, As wel to shewen his heighe magnificence As to don any king a reverence. Greet chere dooth this noble senatour To king Alla, and he to him also; Everich of hem doth other greet honour; And so bifel that, in a day or two, This senatour is to king Alla go To feste, and shortly, if I shal nat lye, Custances sone wente in his companye. Som men wolde seyn, at requeste of Custance, This senatour hath lad this child to feste; I may nat tellen every circumstance, Be as be may, ther was he at the leste. But soth is this, that, at his modres heste, Biforn Alla, during the metes space, The child stood, loking in the kinges face. This Alla king hath of this child greet wonder, And to the senatour he seyde anon, ‘Whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder?’ ‘I noot,’ quod he, ‘by god, and by seint Iohn! A moder he hath, but fader hath he non That I of woot’—but shortly, in a stounde, He tolde Alla how that this child was founde. ‘But god wot,’ quod this senatour also, ‘So vertuous a livere in my lyf, Ne saugh I never as she, ne herde of mo Of worldly wommen, mayden, nor of wyf; I dar wel seyn hir hadde lever a knyf Thurgh-out her breste, than been a womman wikke; Ther is no man coude bringe hir to that prikke.’ Now was this child as lyk un-to Custance As possible is a creature to be. This Alla hath the face in remembrance Of dame Custance, and ther-on mused he If that the childes moder were aught she That was his wyf, and prively he sighte, And spedde him fro the table that he mighte. ‘Parfay,’ thoghte he, ‘fantome is in myn heed! I oghte deme, of skilful Iugement, That in the salte see my wyf is deed.’ And afterward he made his argument— ‘What woot I, if that Crist have hider y-sent My wyf by see, as wel as he hir sente To my contree fro thennes that she wente?’ And, after noon, hoom with the senatour Goth Alla, for to seen this wonder chaunce. This senatour dooth Alla greet honour, And hastifly he sente after Custaunce. But trusteth weel, hir liste nat to daunce Whan that she wiste wherefor was that sonde. Unnethe up-on hir feet she mighte stonde. When Alla saugh his wyf, faire he hir grette, And weep, that it was routhe for to see. For at the firste look he on hir sette He knew wel verraily that it was she. And she for sorwe as domb stant as a tree; So was hir herte shet in hir distresse Whan she remembred his unkindenesse. Twyës she swowned in his owne sighte; He weep, and him excuseth pitously:— ‘Now god,’ quod he, ‘and alle his halwes brighte So wisly on my soule as have mercy, That of your harm as giltelees am I As is Maurice my sone so lyk your face; Elles the feend me fecche out of this place!’ Long was the sobbing and the bitter peyne Er that hir woful hertes mighte cesse; Greet was the pitee for to here hem pleyne, Thurgh whiche pleintes gan hir wo encresse. I prey yow al my labour to relesse; I may nat telle hir wo un-til tomorwe, I am so wery for to speke of sorwe. But fynally, when that the sooth is wist That Alla giltelees was of hir wo, I trowe an hundred tymes been they kist, And swich a blisse is ther bitwix hem two That, save the Ioye that lasteth evermo, Ther is non lyk, that any creature Hath seyn or shal, whyl that the world may dure. Tho preyde she hir housbond mekely, In relief of hir longe pitous pyne, That he wold preye hir fader specially That, of his magestee, he wolde enclyne To vouche-sauf som day with him to dyne; She preyde him eek, he sholde by no weye Un-to hir fader no word of hir seye. Som men wold seyn, how that the child Maurice Doth this message un-to this emperour; But, as I gesse, Alla was nat so nyce To him, that was of so sovereyn honour As he that is of cristen folk the flour, Sente any child, but it is bet to deme He wente him-self, and so it may wel seme. This emperour hath graunted gentilly To come to diner, as he him bisoghte; And wel rede I, he loked bisily Up-on this child, and on his doghter thoghte Alla goth to his in, and, as him oghte, Arrayed for this feste in every wyse As ferforth as his conning may suffyse. The morwe cam, and Alla gan him dresse, And eek his wyf, this emperour to mete; And forth they ryde in Ioye and in gladnesse. And whan she saugh hir fader in the strete, She lighte doun, and falleth him to fete. ‘Fader,’ quod she, ‘your yonge child Custance Is now ful clene out of your remembrance. I am your doghter Custance,’ quod she, ‘That whylom ye han sent un-to Surrye. It am I, fader, that in the salte see Was put allone and dampned for to dye. Now, gode fader, mercy I yow crye, Send me namore un-to non hethenesse, But thonketh my lord heer of his kindenesse.’ Who can the pitous Ioye tellen al Bitwix hem three, sin they ben thus y-mette? But of my tale make an ende I shal; The day goth faste, I wol no lenger lette. This glade folk to diner they hem sette; In Ioye and blisse at mete I lete hem dwelle A thousand fold wel more than I can telle. This child Maurice was sithen emperour Maad by the pope, and lived cristenly. To Cristes chirche he dide greet honour; But I lete al his storie passen by, Of Custance is my tale specially. In olde Romayn gestes may men finde Maurices lyf; I bere it noght in minde. This king Alla, whan he his tyme sey, With his Custance, his holy wyf so swete, To Engelond been they come the righte wey, Wher-as they live in Ioye and in quiete. But litel whyl it lasteth, I yow hete, Ioye of this world, for tyme wol nat abyde; Fro day to night it changeth as the tyde. Who lived ever in swich delyt o day That him ne moeved outher conscience, Or ire, or talent, or som kin affray, Envye, or pryde, or passion, or offence? I ne seye but for this ende this sentence, That litel whyl in Ioye or in plesance Lasteth the blisse of Alla with Custance. For deeth, that taketh of heigh and low his rente, When passed was a yeer, even as I gesse, Out of this world this king Alla he hente, For whom Custance hath ful gret hevinesse. Now lat us preyen god his soule blesse! And dame Custance, fynally to seye, Towards the toun of Rome gooth hir weye. To Rome is come this holy creature, And fyndeth ther hir frendes hole and sounde: Now is she scaped al hir aventure; And whan that she hir fader hath y-founde, Doun on hir kneës falleth she to grounde; Weping for tendrenesse in herte blythe, She herieth god an hundred thousand sythe. In vertu and in holy almes-dede They liven alle, and never a-sonder wende; Til deeth departed hem, this lyf they lede. And fareth now weel, my tale is at an ende. Now Iesu Crist, that of his might may sende Ioye after wo, governe us in his grace, And kepe us alle that ben in this place! Amen. Here endeth the Tale of the Man of Lawe; and next folweth the Shipmannes Prolog. THE SHIPMAN'S PROLOGUE. Here biginneth the Shipmannes Prolog. Our hoste up-on his stiropes stood anon, And seyde, ‘good men, herkneth everich on; This was a thrifty tale for the nones! Sir parish prest,’ quod he, ‘for goddes bones, Tel us a tale, as was thy forward yore. I see wel that ye lerned men in lore Can moche good, by goddes dignitee!’ The Persone him answerde, ‘benedicite! What eyleth the man, so sinfully to swere?’ Our hoste answerde, ‘O Iankin, be ye there? I smelle a loller in the wind,’ quod he. ‘How! good men,’ quod our hoste, ‘herkneth me; Abydeth, for goddes digne passioun, For we shal han a predicacioun; This loller heer wil prechen us som-what.’ ‘Nay, by my fader soule! that shal be nat,’ Seyde the Shipman; ‘heer he shal nat preche, He shal no gospel glosen heer ne teche. We leve alle in the grete god,’ quod he, ‘He wolde sowen som difficultee, Or springen cokkel in our clene corn; And therfor, hoste, I warne thee biforn, My Ioly body shal a tale telle, And I shal clinken yow so mery a belle, That I shal waken al this companye; But it shal nat ben of philosophye, Ne physices, ne termes queinte of lawe; Ther is but litel Latin in my mawe.’ Here endeth the Shipman his Prolog. THE SHIPMANNES TALE. Here biginneth the Shipmannes Tale. A Marchant whylom dwelled at Seint Denys, That riche was, for which men helde him wys; A wyf he hadde of excellent beautee, And compaignable and revelous was she, Which is a thing that causeth more dispence Than worth is al the chere and reverence That men hem doon at festes and at daunces; Swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces Passen as dooth a shadwe up-on the wal. But wo is him that payen moot for al; The sely housbond, algate he mot paye; He moot us clothe, and he moot us arraye, Al for his owene worship richely, In which array we daunce Iolily. And if that he noght may, par-aventure, Or elles, list no swich dispence endure, But thinketh it is wasted and y-lost, Than moot another payen for our cost, Or lene us gold, and that is perilous. This noble Marchant heeld a worthy hous, For which he hadde alday so greet repair For his largesse, and for his wyf was fair, That wonder is; but herkneth to my tale. Amonges alle his gestes, grete and smale, Ther was a monk, a fair man and a bold, I trowe of thritty winter he was old, That ever in oon was drawing to that place. This yonge monk, that was so fair of face, Aqueinted was so with the gode man, Sith that hir firste knoweliche bigan, That in his hous as famulier was he As it possible is any freend to be. And for as muchel as this gode man And eek this monk, of which that I bigan, Were bothe two y-born in o village, The monk him claimeth as for cosinage; And he again, he seith nat ones nay, But was as glad ther-of as fowel of day; For to his herte it was a greet plesaunce. Thus been they knit with eterne alliaunce, And ech of hem gan other for tassure Of bretherhede, whyl that hir lyf may dure. Free was daun Iohn, and namely of dispence, As in that hous; and ful of diligence To doon plesaunce, and also greet costage. He noght forgat to yeve the leeste page In al that hous; but, after hir degree, He yaf the lord, and sitthe al his meynee, When that he cam, som maner honest thing; For which they were as glad of his coming As fowel is fayn, whan that the sonne up-ryseth. Na more of this as now, for it suffyseth. But so bifel, this marchant on a day Shoop him to make redy his array Toward the toun of Brugges for to fare, To byën ther a porcioun of ware; For which he hath to Paris sent anon A messager, and preyed hath daun Iohn That he sholde come to Seint Denys to pleye With him and with his wyf a day or tweye, Er he to Brugges wente, in alle wyse. This noble monk, of which I yow devyse, Hath of his abbot, as him list, licence, By-cause he was a man of heigh prudence, And eek an officer, out for to ryde, To seen hir graunges and hir bernes wyde; And un-to Seint Denys he comth anon. Who was so welcome as my lord daun Iohn, Our dere cosin, ful of curteisye? With him broghte he a Iubbe of Malvesye, And eek another, ful of fyn Vernage, And volatyl, as ay was his usage. And thus I lete hem ete and drinke and pleye, This marchant and this monk, a day or tweye. The thridde day, this marchant up aryseth, And on his nedes sadly him avyseth, And up in-to his countour-hous goth he To rekene with him-self, as wel may be, Of thilke yeer, how that it with him stood, And how that he despended hadde his good; And if that he encressed were or noon. His bokes and his bagges many oon He leith biforn him on his counting-bord; Ful riche was his tresor and his hord, For which ful faste his countour-dore he shette; And eek he nolde that no man sholde him lette Of his accountes, for the mene tyme; And thus he sit til it was passed pryme. Daun Iohn was risen in the morwe also, And in the gardin walketh to and fro, And hath his thinges seyd ful curteisly. This gode wyf cam walking prively In-to the gardin, ther he walketh softe, And him saleweth, as she hath don ofte. A mayde child cam in hir companye, Which as hir list she may governe and gye, For yet under the yerde was the mayde. ‘O dere cosin myn, daun Iohn,’ she sayde, ‘What eyleth yow so rathe for to ryse?’ ‘Nece,’ quod he, ‘it oghte y-nough suffyse Fyve houres for to slepe up-on a night, But it were for an old appalled wight, As been thise wedded men, that lye and dare As in a forme sit a wery hare, Were al for-straught with houndes grete and smale. But dere nece, why be ye so pale? I trowe certes that our gode man Hath yow laboured sith the night bigan, That yow were nede to resten hastily?’ And with that word he lough ful merily, And of his owene thought he wex al reed. This faire wyf gan for to shake hir heed, And seyde thus, ‘ye, god wot al,’ quod she; ‘Nay, cosin myn, it stant nat so with me. For, by that god that yaf me soule and lyf, In al the reme of France is ther no wyf That lasse lust hath to that sory pley. For I may singe “allas” and “weylawey, That I was born,” but to no wight,’ quod she, ‘Dar I nat telle how that it stant with me. Wherfore I thinke out of this land to wende, Or elles of my-self to make an ende, So ful am I of drede and eek of care.’ This monk bigan up-on this wyf to stare, And seyde, ‘allas, my nece, god forbede That ye, for any sorwe or any drede, Fordo your-self; but telleth me your grief; Paraventure I may, in your meschief, Conseille or helpe, and therfore telleth me Al your anoy, for it shal been secree; For on my porthors here I make an ooth, That never in my lyf, for lief ne looth, Ne shal I of no conseil yow biwreye.’ ‘The same agayn to yow,’ quod she, ‘I seye; By god and by this porthors, I yow swere, Though men me wolde al in-to peces tere, Ne shal I never, for to goon to helle, Biwreye a word of thing that ye me telle, Nat for no cosinage ne alliance, But verraily, for love and affiance.’ Thus been they sworn, and heer-upon they kiste, And ech of hem tolde other what hem liste. ‘Cosin,’ quod she, ‘if that I hadde a space, As I have noon, and namely in this place, Than wolde I telle a legende of my lyf, What I have suffred sith I was a wyf With myn housbonde, al be he your cosyn.’ ‘Nay,’ quod this monk, ‘by god and seint Martyn, He is na more cosin un-to me Than is this leef that hangeth on the tree! I clepe him so, by Seint Denys of Fraunce, To have the more cause of aqueintaunce Of yow, which I have loved specially Aboven alle wommen sikerly; This swere I yow on my professioun. Telleth your grief, lest that he come adoun, And hasteth yow, and gooth your wey anon.’ ‘My dere love,’ quod she, ‘o my daun Iohn, Ful lief were me this conseil for to hyde, But out it moot, I may namore abyde. Myn housbond is to me the worste man That ever was, sith that the world bigan. But sith I am a wyf, it sit nat me To tellen no wight of our privetee, Neither a bedde, ne in non other place; God shilde I sholde it tellen, for his grace! A wyf ne shal nat seyn of hir housbonde But al honour, as I can understonde; Save un-to yow thus muche I tellen shal; As help me god, he is noght worth at al In no degree the value of a flye. But yet me greveth most his nigardye; And wel ye woot that wommen naturelly Desyren thinges sixe, as wel as I. They wolde that hir housbondes sholde be Hardy, and wyse, and riche, and ther-to free, And buxom to his wyf, and fresh a-bedde. But, by that ilke lord that for us bledde, For his honour, my-self for to arraye, A Sonday next, I moste nedes paye An hundred frankes, or elles am I lorn. Yet were me lever that I were unborn Than me were doon a sclaundre or vileinye; And if myn housbond eek it mighte espye, I nere but lost, and therfore I yow preye Lene me this somme, or elles moot I deye. Daun Iohn, I seye, lene me thise hundred frankes; Pardee, I wol nat faille yow my thankes, If that yow list to doon that I yow praye. For at a certein day I wol yow paye, And doon to yow what plesance and servyce That I may doon, right as yow list devyse. And but I do, god take on me vengeance As foul as ever had Geniloun of France!’ This gentil monk answerde in this manere; ‘Now, trewely, myn owene lady dere, I have,’ quod he, ‘on yow so greet a routhe, That I yow swere and plighte yow my trouthe, That whan your housbond is to Flaundres fare, I wol delivere yow out of this care; For I wol bringe yow an hundred frankes.’ And with that word he caughte hir by the flankes, And hir embraceth harde, and kiste hir ofte. ‘Goth now your wey,’ quod he, ‘al stille and softe, And lat us dyne as sone as that ye may; For by my chilindre it is pryme of day. Goth now, and beeth as trewe as I shal be.’ ‘Now, elles god forbede, sire,’ quod she, And forth she gooth, as Iolif as a pye, And bad the cokes that they sholde hem hye, So that men mighte dyne, and that anon. Up to hir housbonde is this wyf y-gon, And knokketh at his countour boldely. ‘Qui la?’ quod he. ‘Peter! it am I,’ Quod she, ‘what, sire, how longe wol ye faste? How longe tyme wol ye rekene and caste Your sommes, and your bokes, and your thinges? The devel have part of alle swiche rekeninges! Ye have y-nough, pardee, of goddes sonde; Come doun to-day, and lat your bagges stonde. Ne be ye nat ashamed that daun Iohn Shal fasting al this day elenge goon? What! lat us here a messe, and go we dyne.’ ‘Wyf,’ quod this man, ‘litel canstow devyne The curious bisinesse that we have. For of us chapmen, al-so god me save, And by that lord that cleped is Seint Yve, Scarsly amonges twelve ten shul thryve, Continuelly, lastinge un-to our age. We may wel make chere and good visage, And dryve forth the world as it may be, And kepen our estaat in privetee, Til we be deed, or elles that we pleye A pilgrimage, or goon out of the weye. And therfor have I greet necessitee Up-on this queinte world tavyse me; For evermore we mote stonde in drede Of hap and fortune in our chapmanhede. To Flaundres wol I go to-morwe at day, And come agayn, as sone as ever I may. For which, my dere wyf, I thee biseke, As be to every wight buxom and meke, And for to kepe our good be curious, And honestly governe wel our hous. Thou hast y-nough, in every maner wyse, That to a thrifty houshold may suffyse. Thee lakketh noon array ne no vitaille, Of silver in thy purs shaltow nat faille.’ And with that word his countour-dore he shette, And doun he gooth, no lenger wolde he lette, But hastily a messe was ther seyd, And spedily the tables were y-leyd, And to the diner faste they hem spedde; And richely this monk the chapman fedde. At-after diner daun Iohn sobrely This chapman took a-part, and prively He seyde him thus, ‘cosyn, it standeth so, That wel I see to Brugges wol ye go. God and seint Austin spede yow and gyde! I prey yow, cosin, wysly that ye ryde; Governeth yow also of your diete Atemprely, and namely in this hete. Bitwix us two nedeth no strange fare; Fare-wel, cosyn; god shilde yow fro care. If any thing ther be by day or night, If it lye in my power and my might, That ye me wol comande in any wyse, It shal be doon, right as ye wol devyse. O thing, er that ye goon, if it may be, I wolde prey yow; for to lene me An hundred frankes, for a wyke or tweye, For certein beestes that I moste beye, To store with a place that is oures. God help me so, I wolde it were youres! I shal nat faille surely of my day, Nat for a thousand frankes, a myle-way. But lat this thing be secree, I yow preye, For yet to-night thise beestes moot I beye; And fare-now wel, myn owene cosin dere, Graunt mercy of your cost and of your chere.’ This noble marchant gentilly anon Answerde, and seyde, ‘o cosin myn, daun Iohn, Now sikerly this is a smal requeste; My gold is youres, whan that it yow leste. And nat only my gold, but my chaffare; Take what yow list, god shilde that ye spare. But o thing is, ye knowe it wel y-nogh, Of chapmen, that hir moneye is hir plogh. We may creaunce whyl we have a name, But goldlees for to be, it is no game. Paye it agayn whan it lyth in your ese; After my might ful fayn wolde I yow plese.’ Thise hundred frankes he fette forth anon, And prively he took hem to daun Iohn. No wight in al this world wiste of this lone, Savinge this marchant and daun Iohn allone. They drinke, and speke, and rome a whyle and pleye, Til that daun Iohn rydeth to his abbeye. The morwe cam, and forth this marchant rydeth To Flaundres-ward; his prentis wel him gydeth, Til he cam in-to Brugges merily. Now gooth this marchant faste and bisily Aboute his nede, and byeth and creaunceth. He neither pleyeth at the dees ne daunceth; But as a marchant, shortly for to telle, He let his lyf, and there I lete him dwelle. The Sonday next this Marchant was agon, To Seint Denys y-comen is daun Iohn, With crowne and berd all fresh and newe y-shave. In al the hous ther nas so litel a knave, Ne no wight elles, that he nas ful fayn, For that my lord daun Iohn was come agayn. And shortly to the point right for to gon, This faire wyf accorded with daun Iohn, That for thise hundred frankes he sholde al night Have hir in his armes bolt-upright; And this acord parfourned was in dede. In mirthe al night a bisy lyf they lede Til it was day, that daun Iohn wente his way, And bad the meynee ‘fare-wel, have good day!’ For noon of hem, ne no wight in the toun, Hath of daun Iohn right no suspecioun. And forth he rydeth hoom to his abbeye, Or where him list; namore of him I seye. This marchant, whan that ended was the faire, To Seint Denys he gan for to repaire, And with his wyf he maketh feste and chere, And telleth hir that chaffare is so dere, That nedes moste he make a chevisaunce. For he was bounde in a reconissaunce To paye twenty thousand sheeld anon. For which this marchant is to Paris gon, To borwe of certein frendes that he hadde A certein frankes; and somme with him he ladde. And whan that he was come in-to the toun, For greet chertee and greet affeccioun, Un-to daun Iohn he gooth him first, to pleye; Nat for to axe or borwe of him moneye, But for to wite and seen of his welfare, And for to tellen him of his chaffare, As freendes doon whan they ben met y-fere. Daun Iohn him maketh feste and mery chere; And he him tolde agayn ful specially, How he hadde wel y-boght and graciously, Thanked be god, al hool his marchandyse. Save that he moste, in alle maner wyse, Maken a chevisaunce, as for his beste, And thanne he sholde been in Ioye and reste. Daun Iohn answerde, ‘certes, I am fayn That ye in hele ar comen hoom agayn. And if that I were riche, as have I blisse, Of twenty thousand sheeld shold ye nat misse, For ye so kindely this other day Lente me gold; and as I can and may, I thanke yow, by god and by seint Iame! But nathelees I took un-to our dame, Your wyf at hoom, the same gold ageyn Upon your bench; she woot it wel, certeyn, By certein tokenes that I can hir telle. Now, by your leve, I may no lenger dwelle, Our abbot wol out of this toun anon; And in his companye moot I gon. Grete wel our dame, myn owene nece swete, And fare-wel, dere cosin, til we mete!’ This Marchant, which that was ful war and wys, Creaunced hath, and payd eek in Parys, To certeyn Lumbardes, redy in hir hond, The somme of gold, and gat of hem his bond; And hoom he gooth, mery as a papeiay. For wel he knew he stood in swich array, That nedes moste he winne in that viage A thousand frankes above al his costage. His wyf ful redy mette him atte gate, As she was wont of old usage algate, And al that night in mirthe they bisette; For he was riche and cleerly out of dette. Whan it was day, this marchant gan embrace His wyf al newe, and kiste hir on hir face, And up he gooth and maketh it ful tough. ‘Namore,’ quod she, ‘by god, ye have y-nough!’ And wantounly agayn with him she pleyde; Til, atte laste, that this Marchant seyde, ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘I am a litel wrooth With yow, my wyf, al-thogh it be me looth. And woot ye why? by god, as that I gesse, That ye han maad a maner straungenesse Bitwixen me and my cosyn daun Iohn. Ye sholde han warned me, er I had gon, That he yow hadde an hundred frankes payed By redy tokene; and heeld him yvel apayed, For that I to him spak of chevisaunce, Me semed so, as by his contenaunce. But nathelees, by god our hevene king, I thoghte nat to axe of him no-thing. I prey thee, wyf, ne do namore so; Tel me alwey, er that I fro thee go, If any dettour hath in myn absence Y-payëd thee; lest, thurgh thy necligence, I mighte him axe a thing that he hath payed.’ This wyf was nat afered nor affrayed, But boldely she seyde, and that anon: ‘Marie, I defye the false monk, daun Iohn! I kepe nat of hise tokenes never a deel; He took me certein gold, that woot I weel! What! yvel thedom on his monkes snoute! For, god it woot, I wende, withouten doute, That he had yeve it me bycause of yow, To doon ther-with myn honour and my prow, For cosinage, and eek for bele chere That he hath had ful ofte tymes here. But sith I see I stonde in this disioint, I wol answere yow shortly, to the point. Ye han mo slakker dettours than am I! For I wol paye yow wel and redily Fro day to day; and, if so be I faille, I am your wyf; score it up-on my taille, And I shal paye, as sone as ever I may. For, by my trouthe, I have on myn array, And nat on wast, bistowed every deel. And for I have bistowed it so weel For your honour, for goddes sake, I seye, As be nat wrooth, but lat us laughe and pleye. Ye shal my Ioly body have to wedde; By god, I wol nat paye yow but a-bedde. Forgive it me, myn owene spouse dere; Turne hiderward and maketh bettre chere.’ This marchant saugh ther was no remedye, And, for to chyde, it nere but greet folye, Sith that the thing may nat amended be. ‘Now, wyf,’ he seyde, ‘and I foryeve it thee; But, by thy lyf, ne be namore so large; Keep bet our good, this yeve I thee in charge.’ Thus endeth now my tale, and god us sende Taling y-nough un-to our lyves ende. Amen. Here endeth the Shipmannes Tale. THE PRIORESS'S PROLOGUE. Bihold the mery wordes of the Host to the Shipman and to the lady Prioresse. ‘Wel seyd, by corpus dominus,’ quod our hoste, ‘Now longe moot thou sayle by the coste, Sir gentil maister, gentil marineer! God yeve this monk a thousand last quad yeer! A ha! felawes! beth ware of swiche a Iape! The monk putte in the mannes hood an ape, And in his wyves eek, by seint Austin! Draweth no monkes more un-to your in. But now passe over, and lat us seke aboute, Who shal now telle first, of al this route, Another tale;’ and with that word he sayde, As curteisly as it had been a mayde, ‘My lady Prioresse, by your leve, So that I wiste I sholde yow nat greve, I wolde demen that ye tellen sholde A tale next, if so were that ye wolde. Now wol ye vouche-sauf, my lady dere?’ ‘Gladly,’ quod she, and seyde as ye shal here. Explicit. THE PRIORESSES TALE. The Prologe of the Prioresses Tale. Domine, dominus noster. O LORD our lord, thy name how merveillous Is in this large worlde y-sprad—quod she:— For noght only thy laude precious Parfourned is by men of dignitee, But by the mouth of children thy bountee Parfourned is, for on the brest soukinge Som tyme shewen they thyn heryinge. Wherfor in laude, as I best can or may, Of thee, and of the whyte lily flour Which that thee bar, and is a mayde alway, To telle a storie I wol do my labour; Not that I may encresen hir honour; For she hir-self is honour, and the rote Of bountee, next hir sone, and soules bote.— O moder mayde! o mayde moder free! O bush unbrent, brenninge in Moyses sighte, That ravisedest doun fro the deitee, Thurgh thyn humblesse, the goost that in thalighte, Of whos vertu, whan he thyn herte lighte, Conceived was the fadres sapience, Help me to telle it in thy reverence! Lady! thy bountee, thy magnificence, Thy vertu, and thy grete humilitee Ther may no tonge expresse in no science; For som-tyme, lady, er men praye to thee, Thou goost biforn of thy benignitee, And getest us the light, thurgh thy preyere, To gyden us un-to thy sone so dere. My conning is so wayk, o blisful quene, For to declare thy grete worthinesse, That I ne may the weighte nat sustene, But as a child of twelf monthe old, or lesse, That can unnethes any word expresse, Right so fare I, and therfor I yow preye, Gydeth my song that I shal of yow seye. Explicit. Here biginneth the Prioresses Tale. Ther was in Asie, in a greet citee, Amonges cristen folk, a Iewerye, Sustened by a lord of that contree For foule usure and lucre of vilanye, Hateful to Crist and to his companye; And thurgh the strete men mighte ryde or wende, For it was free, and open at either ende. A litel scole of cristen folk ther stood Doun at the ferther ende, in which ther were Children an heep, y-comen of cristen blood, That lerned in that scole yeer by yere Swich maner doctrine as men used there, This is to seyn, to singen and to rede, As smale children doon in hir childhede. Among thise children was a widwes sone, A litel clergeon, seven yeer of age, That day by day to scole was his wone, And eek also, wher-as he saugh thimage Of Cristes moder, hadde he in usage, As him was taught, to knele adoun and seye His Ave Marie, as he goth by the weye. Thus hath this widwe hir litel sone y-taught Our blisful lady, Cristes moder dere, To worshipe ay, and he forgat it naught, For sely child wol alday sone lere; But ay, whan I remembre on this matere, Seint Nicholas stant ever in my presence, For he so yong to Crist did reverence. This litel child, his litel book lerninge, As he sat in the scole at his prymer, He Alma redemptoris herde singe, As children lerned hir antiphoner; And, as he dorste, he drough him ner and ner, And herkned ay the wordes and the note, Til he the firste vers coude al by rote. Noght wiste he what this Latin was to seye, For he so yong and tendre was of age; But on a day his felaw gan he preye Texpounden him this song in his langage, Or telle him why this song was in usage; This preyde he him to construe and declare Ful ofte tyme upon his knowes bare. His felaw, which that elder was than he, Answerde him thus: ‘this song, I have herd seye, Was maked of our blisful lady free, Hir to salue, and eek hir for to preye To been our help and socour whan we deye. I can no more expounde in this matere; I lerne song, I can but smal grammere.’ ‘And is this song maked in reverence Of Cristes moder?’ seyde this innocent; ‘Now certes, I wol do my diligence To conne it al, er Cristemasse is went; Though that I for my prymer shal be shent, And shal be beten thryës in an houre, I wol it conne, our lady for to honoure.’ His felaw taughte him homward prively, Fro day to day, til he coude it by rote, And than he song it wel and boldely Fro word to word, acording with the note; Twyës a day it passed thurgh his throte, To scoleward and homward whan he wente; On Cristes moder set was his entente. As I have seyd, thurgh-out the Iewerye This litel child, as he cam to and fro, Ful merily than wolde he singe, and crye O Alma redemptoris ever-mo. The swetnes hath his herte perced so Of Cristes moder, that, to hir to preye, He can nat stinte of singing by the weye. Our firste fo, the serpent Sathanas, That hath in Iewes herte his waspes nest, Up swal, and seide, ‘o Hebraik peple, allas! Is this to yow a thing that is honest, That swich a boy shal walken as him lest In your despyt, and singe of swich sentence, Which is agayn your lawes reverence?’ Fro thennes forth the Iewes han conspyred This innocent out of this world to chace; An homicyde ther-to han they hyred, That in an aley hadde a privee place; And as the child gan for-by for to pace, This cursed Iew him hente and heeld him faste, And kitte his throte, and in a pit him caste. I seye that in a wardrobe they him threwe Wher-as these Iewes purgen hir entraille. O cursed folk of Herodes al newe, What may your yvel entente yow availle? Mordre wol out, certein, it wol nat faille, And namely ther thonour of god shal sprede, The blood out cryeth on your cursed dede. ‘O martir, souded to virginitee, Now maystou singen, folwing ever in oon The whyte lamb celestial,’ quod she, ‘Of which the grete evangelist, seint Iohn, In Pathmos wroot, which seith that they that goon Biforn this lamb, and singe a song al newe, That never, fleshly, wommen they ne knewe.’ This povre widwe awaiteth al that night After hir litel child, but he cam noght; For which, as sone as it was dayes light, With face pale of drede and bisy thoght, She hath at scole and elles-wher him soght, Til finally she gan so fer espye That he last seyn was in the Iewerye. With modres pitee in hir brest enclosed, She gooth, as she were half out of hir minde, To every place wher she hath supposed By lyklihede hir litel child to finde; And ever on Cristes moder meke and kinde She cryde, and atte laste thus she wroghte, Among the cursed Iewes she him soghte. She frayneth and she preyeth pitously To every Iew that dwelte in thilke place, To telle hir, if hir child wente oght for-by. They seyde, ‘nay’; but Iesu, of his grace, Yaf in hir thought, inwith a litel space, That in that place after hir sone she cryde, Wher he was casten in a pit bisyde. O grete god, that parfournest thy laude By mouth of innocents, lo heer thy might! This gemme of chastitee, this emeraude, And eek of martirdom the ruby bright, Ther he with throte y-corven lay upright, He ‘Alma redemptoris’ gan to singe So loude, that al the place gan to ringe. The Cristen folk, that thurgh the strete wente, In coomen, for to wondre up-on this thing, And hastily they for the provost sente; He cam anon with-outen tarying, And herieth Crist that is of heven king, And eek his moder, honour of mankinde, And after that, the Iewes leet he binde. This child with pitous lamentacioun Up-taken was, singing his song alway; And with honour of greet processioun They carien him un-to the nexte abbay. His moder swowning by the bere lay; Unnethe might the peple that was there This newe Rachel bringe fro his bere. With torment and with shamful deth echon This provost dooth thise Iewes for to sterve That of this mordre wiste, and that anon; He nolde no swich cursednesse observe. Yvel shal have, that yvel wol deserve. Therfor with wilde hors he dide hem drawe, And after that he heng hem by the lawe. Up-on his bere ay lyth this innocent Biforn the chief auter, whyl masse laste, And after that, the abbot with his covent Han sped hem for to burien him ful faste; And whan they holy water on him caste, Yet spak this child, whan spreynd was holy water, And song—‘O Alma redemptoris mater!’ This abbot, which that was an holy man As monkes been, or elles oghten be, This yonge child to coniure he bigan, And seyde, ‘o dere child, I halse thee, In vertu of the holy Trinitee, Tel me what is thy cause for to singe, Sith that thy throte is cut, to my seminge?’ ‘My throte is cut un-to my nekke-boon,’ Seyde this child, ‘and, as by wey of kinde, I sholde have deyed, ye, longe tyme agoon, But Iesu Crist, as ye in bokes finde, Wil that his glorie laste and be in minde, And, for the worship of his moder dere, Yet may I singe “O Alma” loude and clere. This welle of mercy, Cristes moder swete, I lovede alwey, as after my conninge; And whan that I my lyf sholde forlete, To me she cam, and bad me for to singe This antem verraily in my deyinge, As ye han herd, and, whan that I had songe, Me thoughte, she leyde a greyn up-on my tonge. Wherfor I singe, and singe I moot certeyn In honour of that blisful mayden free, Til fro my tonge of-taken is the greyn; And afterward thus seyde she to me, “My litel child, now wol I fecche thee Whan that the greyn is fro thy tonge y-take; Be nat agast, I wol thee nat forsake.”’ This holy monk, this abbot, him mene I, His tonge out-caughte, and took a-wey the greyn, And he yaf up the goost ful softely. And whan this abbot had this wonder seyn, His salte teres trikled doun as reyn, And gruf he fil al plat up-on the grounde, And stille he lay as he had been y-bounde. The covent eek lay on the pavement Weping, and herien Cristes moder dere, And after that they ryse, and forth ben went, And toke awey this martir fro his bere, And in a tombe of marbul-stones clere Enclosen they his litel body swete; Ther he is now, god leve us for to mete. O yonge Hugh of Lincoln, slayn also With cursed Iewes, as it is notable, For it nis but a litel whyle ago; Preye eek for us, we sinful folk unstable, That, of his mercy, god so merciable On us his grete mercy multiplye, For reverence of his moder Marye. Amen. Here is ended the Prioresses Tale. PROLOGUE TO SIR THOPAS. Bihold the murye wordes of the Host to Chaucer. Whan seyd was al this miracle, every man As sobre was, that wonder was to se, Til that our hoste Iapen tho bigan, And than at erst he loked up-on me, And seyde thus, ‘what man artow?’ quod he; ‘Thou lokest as thou woldest finde an hare, For ever up-on the ground I see thee stare. Approche neer, and loke up merily. Now war yow, sirs, and lat this man have place; He in the waast is shape as wel as I; This were a popet in an arm tenbrace For any womman, smal and fair of face. He semeth elvish by his contenaunce, For un-to no wight dooth he daliaunce. Sey now somwhat, sin other folk han sayd; Tel us a tale of mirthe, and that anoon;’— ‘Hoste,’ quod I, ‘ne beth nat yvel apayd, For other tale certes can I noon, But of a ryme I lerned longe agoon.’ ‘Ye, that is good,’ quod he; ‘now shul we here Som deyntee thing, me thinketh by his chere.’ Explicit. SIR THOPAS. Here biginneth Chaucers Tale of Thopas. [[The First Fit.]] Listeth, lordes, in good entent, And I wol telle verrayment Of mirthe and of solas; Al of a knyght was fair and gent In bataille and in tourneyment, His name was sir Thopas. Y-born he was in fer contree, In Flaundres, al biyonde the see, At Popering, in the place; His fader was a man ful free, And lord he was of that contree, As it was goddes grace. Sir Thopas wex a doghty swayn, Whyt was his face as payndemayn, His lippes rede as rose; His rode is lyk scarlet in grayn, And I yow telle in good certayn, He hadde a semely nose. His heer, his berd was lyk saffroun, That to his girdel raughte adoun; His shoon of Cordewane. Of Brugges were his hosen broun, His robe was of ciclatoun, That coste many a Iane. He coude hunte at wilde deer, And ryde an hauking for riveer, With grey goshauk on honde; Ther-to he was a good archeer, Of wrastling was ther noon his peer, Ther any ram shal stonde. Ful many a mayde, bright in bour, They moorne for him, paramour, Whan hem were bet to slepe; But he was chast and no lechour, And sweet as is the bremble-flour That bereth the rede hepe. And so bifel up-on a day, For sothe, as I yow telle may, Sir Thopas wolde out ryde; He worth upon his stede gray, And in his honde a launcegay, A long swerd by his syde. He priketh thurgh a fair forest, Ther-inne is many a wilde best, Ye, bothe bukke and hare; And, as he priketh north and est, I telle it yow, him hadde almest Bitid a sory care. Ther springen herbes grete and smale, The lycorys and cetewale, And many a clowe-gilofre; And notemuge to putte in ale, Whether it be moyste or stale, Or for to leye in cofre. The briddes singe, it is no nay, The sparhauk and the papeiay, That Ioye it was to here; The thrustelcok made eek his lay, The wodedowve upon the spray She sang ful loude and clere. Sir Thopas fil in love-longinge Al whan he herde the thrustel singe, And priked as he were wood: His faire stede in his prikinge So swatte that men mighte him wringe, His sydes were al blood. Sir Thopas eek so wery was For prikinge on the softe gras, So fiers was his corage, That doun he leyde him in that plas To make his stede som solas, And yaf him good forage. ‘O seinte Marie, benedicite! What eyleth this love at me To binde me so sore? Me dremed al this night, pardee, An elf-queen shal my lemman be, And slepe under my gore. An elf-queen wol I love, y-wis, For in this world no womman is Worthy to be my make In toune; Alle othere wommen I forsake, And to an elf-queen I me take By dale and eek by doune!’ In-to his sadel he clamb anoon, And priketh over style and stoon An elf-queen for tespye, Til he so longe had riden and goon That he fond, in a privce woon, The contree of Fairye So wilde; For in that contree was ther noon That to him dorste ryde or goon, Neither wyf ne childe. Til that ther cam a greet geaunt, His name was sir Olifaunt, A perilous man of dede; He seyde, ‘child, by Termagaunt, But-if thou prike out of myn haunt, Anon I slee thy stede With mace. Heer is the queen of Fayërye, With harpe and pype and simphonye Dwelling in this place.’ The child seyde, ‘al-so mote I thee, Tomorwe wol I mete thee Whan I have myn armoure; And yet I hope, par ma fay, That thou shalt with this launcegay Abyen it ful soure; Thy mawe Shal I percen, if I may, Er it be fully pryme of day, For heer thou shalt be slawe.’ Sir Thopas drow abak ful faste; This geaunt at him stones caste Out of a fel staf-slinge; But faire escapeth child Thopas, And al it was thurgh goddes gras, And thurgh his fair beringe. Yet listeth, lordes, to my tale Merier than the nightingale, For now I wol yow roune How sir Thopas with sydes smale, Priking over hil and dale, Is come agayn to toune. His merie men comanded he To make him bothe game and glee, For nedes moste he fighte With a geaunt with hevedes three, For paramour and Iolitee Of oon that shoon ful brighte. ‘Do come,’ he seyde, ‘my minstrales, And gestours, for to tellen tales Anon in myn arminge; Of romances that been royales, Of popes and of cardinales, And eek of love-lykinge.’ They fette him first the swete wyn, And mede eek in a maselyn, And royal spicerye Of gingebreed that was ful fyn, And lycorys, and eek comyn, With sugre that is so trye. He dide next his whyte lere Of clooth of lake fyn and clere A breech and eek a sherte; And next his sherte an aketoun, And over that an habergeoun For percinge of his herte; And over that a fyn hauberk, Was al y-wroght of Iewes werk, Ful strong it was of plate; And over that his cote-armour As whyt as is a lily-flour, In which he wol debate. His sheeld was al of gold so reed, And ther-in was a bores heed, A charbocle bisyde; And there he swoor, on ale and breed, How that ‘the geaunt shal be deed, Bityde what bityde!’ His Iambeux were of quirboilly, His swerdes shethe of yvory, His helm of laton bright; His sadel was of rewel-boon, His brydel as the sonne shoon, Or as the mone light. His spere was of fyn ciprees, That bodeth werre, and no-thing pees, The heed ful sharpe y-grounde; His stede was al dappel-gray, It gooth an ambel in the way Ful softely and rounde In londe. Lo, lordes myne, heer is a fit! If ye wol any more of it, To telle it wol I fonde. [The Second Fit.] Now hold your mouth, par charitee, Bothe knight and lady free, And herkneth to my spelle; Of bataille and of chivalry, And of ladyes love-drury Anon I wol yow telle. Men speke of romances of prys, Of Horn child and of Ypotys, Of Bevis and sir Gy, Of sir Libeux and Pleyn-damour; But sir Thopas, he bereth the flour Of royal chivalry. His gode stede al he bistrood, And forth upon his wey he glood As sparkle out of the bronde; Up-on his crest he bar a tour, And ther-in stiked a lily-flour, God shilde his cors fro shonde! And for he was a knight auntrous, He nolde slepen in non hous, But liggen in his hode; His brighte helm was his wonger, And by him baiteth his dextrer Of herbes fyne and gode. Him-self drank water of the wel, As did the knight sir Percivel, So worthy under wede, Til on a day— Here the Host stinteth Chaucer of his Tale of Thopas. PROLOGUE TO MELIBEUS. ‘No more of this, for goddes dignitee,’ Quod oure hoste, ‘for thou makest me So wery of thy verray lewednesse That, also wisly god my soule blesse, Myn eres aken of thy drasty speche; Now swiche a rym the devel I biteche! This may wel be rym dogerel,’ quod he. ‘Why so?’ quod I, ‘why wiltow lette me More of my tale than another man, Sin that it is the beste rym I can?’ ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘for pleynly, at a word, Thy drasty ryming is nat worth a tord; Thou doost nought elles but despendest tyme, Sir, at o word, thou shalt no lenger ryme. Lat see wher thou canst tellen aught in geste, Or telle in prose somwhat at the leste In which ther be som mirthe or som doctryne.’ ‘Gladly,’ quod I, ‘by goddes swete pyne, I wol yow telle a litel thing in prose, That oghte lyken yow, as I suppose, Or elles, certes, ye been to daungerous. It is a moral tale vertuous, Al be it told som-tyme in sondry wyse Of sondry folk, as I shal yow devyse. As thus; ye woot that every evangelist, That telleth us the peyne of Iesu Crist, Ne saith nat al thing as his felaw dooth, But natheles, hir sentence is al sooth, And alle acorden as in hir sentence, Al be ther in hir telling difference. For somme of hem seyn more, and somme lesse, Whan they his pitous passioun expresse; I mene of Marke, Mathew, Luk and Iohn; But doutelees hir sentence is al oon. Therfor, lordinges alle, I yow biseche, If that ye thinke I varie as in my speche, As thus, thogh that I telle som-what more Of proverbes, than ye han herd bifore, Comprehended in this litel tretis here, To enforce with the theffect of my matere, And thogh I nat the same wordes seye As ye han herd, yet to yow alle I preye, Blameth me nat; for, as in my sentence, Ye shul not fynden moche difference Fro the sentence of this tretis lyte After the which this mery tale I wryte. And therfor herkneth what that I shal seye, And lat me tellen al my tale, I preye.’ Explicit. THE MONK'S PROLOGUE. The mery wordes of the Host to the Monk. Whan ended was my tale of Melibee, And of Prudence and hir benignitee, Our hoste seyde, ‘as I am faithful man, And by the precious corpus Madrian, I hadde lever than a barel ale That goode lief my wyf hadde herd this tale! For she nis no-thing of swich pacience As was this Melibeus wyf Prudence. By goddes bones! whan I bete my knaves, She bringth me forth the grete clobbed staves, And cryeth, “slee the dogges everichoon, And brek hem, bothe bak and every boon.” And if that any neighebor of myne Wol nat in chirche to my wyf enclyne, Or be so hardy to hir to trespace, Whan she comth hoom, she rampeth in my face, And cryeth, “false coward, wreek thy wyf, By corpus bones! I wol have thy knyf, And thou shalt have my distaf and go spinne!” Fro day to night right thus she wol biginne;— “Allas!” she seith, “that ever I was shape To wedde a milksop or a coward ape, That wol be overlad with every wight! Thou darst nat stonden by thy wyves right!” This is my lyf, but-if that I wol fighte; And out at dore anon I moot me dighte, Or elles I am but lost, but-if that I Be lyk a wilde leoun fool-hardy. I woot wel she wol do me slee som day Som neighebor, and thanne go my wey. For I am perilous with knyf in honde, Al be it that I dar nat hir withstonde, For she is big in armes, by my feith, That shal he finde, that hir misdooth or seith. But lat us passe awey fro this matere. My lord the Monk,’ quod he, ‘be mery of chere; For ye shul telle a tale trewely. Lo! Rouchestre stant heer faste by! Ryd forth, myn owene lord, brek nat our game, But, by my trouthe, I knowe nat your name, Wher shal I calle yow my lord dan Iohn, Or dan Thomas, or elles dan Albon? Of what hous be ye, by your fader kin? I vow to god, thou hast a ful fair skin, It is a gentil pasture ther thou goost; Thou art nat lyk a penaunt or a goost. Upon my feith, thou art som officer, Som worthy sexteyn, or som celerer, For by my fader soule, as to my doom, Thou art a maister whan thou art at hoom; No povre cloisterer, ne no novys, But a governour, wyly and wys. And therwithal of brawnes and of bones A wel-faring persone for the nones. I pray to god, yeve him confusioun That first thee broghte un-to religioun; Thou woldest han been a trede-foul aright. Haddestow as greet a leve, as thou hast might To parfourne al thy lust in engendrure, Thou haddest bigeten many a creature. Alas! why werestow so wyd a cope? God yeve me sorwe! but, and I were a pope, Not only thou, but every mighty man, Thogh he were shorn ful hye upon his pan, Sholde have a wyf; for al the world is lorn! Religioun hath take up al the corn Of treding, and we borel men ben shrimpes! Of feble trees ther comen wrecched impes. This maketh that our heires been so sclendre And feble, that they may nat wel engendre. This maketh that our wyves wol assaye Religious folk, for ye may bettre paye Of Venus payements than mowe we; God woot, no lussheburghes payen ye! But be nat wrooth, my lord, for that I pleye; Ful ofte in game a sooth I have herd seye.’ This worthy monk took al in pacience, And seyde, ‘I wol doon al my diligence, As fer as souneth in-to honestee, To telle yow a tale, or two, or three. And if yow list to herkne hiderward, I wol yow seyn the lyf of seint Edward; Or elles first Tragedies wol I telle Of whiche I have an hundred in my celle. Tragedie is to seyn a certeyn storie, As olde bokes maken us memorie, Of him that stood in greet prosperitee And is y-fallen out of heigh degree Into miserie, and endeth wrecchedly. And they ben versifyed comunly Of six feet, which men clepe exametron. In prose eek been endyted many oon, And eek in metre, in many a sondry wyse. Lo! this declaring oughte y-nough suffise. Now herkneth, if yow lyketh for to here; But first I yow biseke in this matere, Though I by ordre telle nat thise thinges, Be it of popes, emperours, or kinges, After hir ages, as men writen finde, But telle hem som bifore and som bihinde, As it now comth un-to my remembraunce; Have me excused of myn ignoraunce.’ Explicit. THE MONKES TALE. Here biginneth the Monkes Tale, de Casibus Virorum Illustrium. I wol biwayle in maner of Tragedie The harm of hem that stode in heigh degree, And fillen so that ther nas no remedie To bringe hem out of hir adversitee; For certein, whan that fortune list to flee, Ther may no man the cours of hir withholde; Lat no man truste on blind prosperitee; Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde. Lucifer. At Lucifer, though he an angel were, And nat a man, at him I wol biginne; For, thogh fortune may non angel dere, From heigh degree yet fel he for his sinne Doun in-to helle, wher he yet is inne. O Lucifer! brightest of angels alle, Now artow Sathanas, that maist nat twinne Out of miserie, in which that thou art falle. Adam. Lo Adam, in the feld of Damassene, With goddes owene finger wroght was he, And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene, And welte al Paradys, saving o tree. Had never worldly man so heigh degree As Adam, til he for misgovernaunce Was drive out of his hye prosperitee To labour, and to helle, and to meschaunce. Sampson. Lo Sampson, which that was annunciat By thangel, longe er his nativitee, And was to god almighty consecrat, And stood in noblesse, whyl he mighte see. Was never swich another as was he, To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardinesse; But to his wyves tolde he his secree, Through which he slow him-self, for wrecchednesse. Sampson, this noble almighty champioun, Withouten wepen save his hondes tweye, He slow and al to-rente the leoun, Toward his wedding walking by the weye. His false wyf coude him so plese and preye Til she his conseil knew, and she untrewe Un-to his foos his conseil gan biwreye, And him forsook, and took another newe. Three hundred foxes took Sampson for ire, And alle hir tayles he togider bond, And sette the foxes tayles alle on fire, For he on every tayl had knit a brond; And they brende alle the cornes in that lond, And alle hir oliveres and vynes eek. A thousand men he slow eek with his hond, And had no wepen but an asses cheek. Whan they were slayn, so thursted him that he Was wel ny lorn, for which he gan to preye That god wolde on his peyne han som pitee, And sende him drinke, or elles moste he deye; And of this asses cheke, that was dreye, Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle, Of which he drank y-nogh, shortly to seye, Thus heelp him god, as Iudicum can telle. By verray force, at Gazan, on a night, Maugree Philistiens of that citee, The gates of the toun he hath up-plight, And on his bak y-caried hem hath he Hye on an hille, that men mighte hem see. O noble almighty Sampson, leef and dere, Had thou nat told to wommen thy secree, In al this worlde ne hadde been thy pere! This Sampson never sicer drank ne wyn, Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne shere, By precept of the messager divyn, For alle his strengthes in his heres were; And fully twenty winter, yeer by yere, He hadde of Israel the governaunce. But sone shal he wepen many a tere, For wommen shal him bringen to meschaunce! Un-to his lemman Dalida he tolde That in his heres al his strengthe lay, And falsly to his fo-men she him solde. And sleping in hir barme up-on a day She made to clippe or shere his heer awey, And made his fo-men al his craft espyen; And whan that they him fonde in this array, They bounde him faste, and putten out his yën. But er his heer were clipped or y-shave, Ther was no bond with which men might him binde; But now is he in prisoun in a cave, Wher-as they made him at the querne grinde. O noble Sampson, strongest of mankinde, O whylom Iuge in glorie and in richesse, Now maystow wepen with thyn yën blinde, Sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse. Thende of this caytif was as I shal seye; His fo-men made a feste upon a day, And made him as hir fool bifore hem pleye, And this was in a temple of greet array. But atte laste he made a foul affray; For he two pilers shook, and made hem falle, And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay, And slow him-self, and eek his fo-men alle. This is to seyn, the princes everichoon, And eek three thousand bodies wer ther slayn With falling of the grete temple of stoon. Of Sampson now wol I na-more seyn. Beth war by this ensample old and playn That no men telle hir conseil til hir wyves Of swich thing as they wolde han secree fayn, If that it touche hir limmes or hir lyves. Hercules. Of Hercules the sovereyn conquerour Singen his workes laude and heigh renoun; For in his tyme of strengthe he was the flour. He slow, and rafte the skin of the leoun; He of Centauros leyde the boost adoun; He Arpies slow, the cruel briddes felle; He golden apples rafte of the dragoun; He drow out Cerberus, the hound of helle: He slow the cruel tyrant Busirus, And made his hors to frete him, flesh and boon; He slow the firy serpent venimous; Of Achelois two hornes, he brak oon; And he slow Cacus in a cave of stoon; He slow the geaunt Antheus the stronge; He slow the grisly boor, and that anoon, And bar the heven on his nekke longe. Was never wight, sith that the world bigan, That slow so many monstres as dide he. Thurgh-out this wyde world his name ran, What for his strengthe, and for his heigh bountee, And every reaume wente he for to see. He was so strong that no man mighte him lette; At bothe the worldes endes, seith Trophee, In stede of boundes, he a piler sette. A lemman hadde this noble champioun, That highte Dianira, fresh as May; And, as thise clerkes maken mencioun, She hath him sent a sherte fresh and gay. Allas! this sherte, allas and weylaway! Envenimed was so subtilly with-alle, That, er that he had wered it half a day, It made his flesh al from his bones falle. But nathelees somme clerkes hir excusen By oon that highte Nessus, that it maked; Be as be may, I wol hir noght accusen; But on his bak this sherte he wered al naked, Til that his flesh was for the venim blaked. And whan he sey noon other remedye, In hote coles he hath him-selven raked, For with no venim deyned him to dye. Thus starf this worthy mighty Hercules; Lo, who may truste on fortune any throwe? For him that folweth al this world of prees, Er he be war, is ofte y-leyd ful lowe. Ful wys is he that can him-selven knowe. Beth war, for whan that fortune list to glose, Than wayteth she hir man to overthrowe By swich a wey as he wolde leest suppose. Nabugodonosor (Nebuchadnezzar). The mighty trone, the precious tresor, The glorious ceptre and royal magestee That hadde the king Nabugodonosor, With tonge unnethe may discryved be. He twyes wan Ierusalem the citee; The vessel of the temple he with him ladde. At Babiloyne was his sovereyn see, In which his glorie and his delyt he hadde. The fairest children of the blood royal Of Israel he leet do gelde anoon, And maked ech of hem to been his thral. Amonges othere Daniel was oon, That was the wysest child of everichoon; For he the dremes of the king expouned, Wher-as in Chaldey clerk ne was ther noon That wiste to what fyn his dremes souned. This proude king leet make a statue of golde, Sixty cubytes long, and seven in brede, To which image bothe yonge and olde Comaunded he to loute, and have in drede; Or in a fourneys ful of flambes rede He shal be brent, that wolde noght obeye. But never wolde assente to that dede Daniel, ne his yonge felawes tweye. This king of kinges proud was and elaat, He wende that god, that sit in magestee, Ne mighte him nat bireve of his estaat: But sodeynly he loste his dignitee, And lyk a beste him semed for to be, And eet hay as an oxe, and lay ther-oute; In reyn with wilde bestes walked he, Til certein tyme was y-come aboute. And lyk an egles fetheres wexe his heres, His nayles lyk a briddes clawes were; Til god relessed him a certein yeres, And yaf him wit; and than with many a tere He thanked god, and ever his lyf in fere Was he to doon amis, or more trespace, And, til that tyme he leyd was on his bere, He knew that god was ful of might and grace. Balthasar (Belshazzar). His sone, which that highte Balthasar, That heeld the regne after his fader day, He by his fader coude nought be war, For proud he was of herte and of array; And eek an ydolastre was he ay. His hye estaat assured him in pryde. But fortune caste him doun, and ther he lay, And sodeynly his regne gan divyde. A feste he made un-to his lordes alle Up-on a tyme, and bad hem blythe be, And than his officeres gan he calle— ‘Goth, bringeth forth the vessels,’ [tho] quod he, ‘Which that my fader, in his prosperitee, Out of the temple of Ierusalem birafte, And to our hye goddes thanke we Of honour, that our eldres with us lafte.’ His wyf, his lordes, and his concubynes Ay dronken, whyl hir appetytes laste, Out of thise noble vessels sundry wynes; And on a wal this king his yën caste, And sey an hond armlees, that wroot ful faste, For fere of which he quook and syked sore. This hond, that Balthasar so sore agaste, Wroot Mane, techel, phares, and na-more. In al that lond magicien was noon That coude expoune what this lettre mente; But Daniel expouned it anoon, And seyde, ‘king, god to thy fader lente Glorie and honour, regne, tresour, rente: And he was proud, and no-thing god ne dradde, And therfor god gret wreche up-on him sente, And him birafte the regne that he hadde. He was out cast of mannes companye, With asses was his habitacioun, And eet hey as a beste in weet and drye, Til that he knew, by grace and by resoun, That god of heven hath dominacioun Over every regne and every creature; And thanne had god of him compassioun, And him restored his regne and his figure. Eek thou, that art his sone, art proud also, And knowest alle thise thinges verraily, And art rebel to god, and art his fo. Thou drank eek of his vessels boldely; Thy wyf eek and thy wenches sinfully Dronke of the same vessels sondry wynes, And heriest false goddes cursedly; Therfor to thee y-shapen ful gret pyne is. This hand was sent from god, that on the walle Wroot mane, techel, phares, truste me; Thy regne is doon, thou weyest noght at alle; Divyded is thy regne, and it shal be To Medes and to Perses yeven,’ quod he. And thilke same night this king was slawe, And Darius occupyeth his degree, Thogh he therto had neither right ne lawe. Lordinges, ensample heer-by may ye take How that in lordshipe is no sikernesse; For whan fortune wol a man forsake, She bereth awey his regne and his richesse, And eek his freendes, bothe more and lesse; For what man that hath freendes thurgh fortune, Mishap wol make hem enemys, I gesse: This proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune. Cenobia (Zenobia). Cenobia, of Palimerie quene, As writen Persiens of hir noblesse, So worthy was in armes and so kene, That no wight passed hir in hardinesse, Ne in linage, ne in other gentillesse. Of kinges blode of Perse is she descended; I seye nat that she hadde most fairnesse, But of hir shape she mighte nat been amended. From hir childhede I finde that she fledde Office of wommen, and to wode she wente; And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde With arwes brode that she to hem sente. She was so swift that she anon hem hente, And whan that she was elder, she wolde kille Leouns, lepardes, and beres al to-rente, And in hir armes welde hem at hir wille. She dorste wilde beestes dennes seke, And rennen in the montaignes al the night, And slepen under a bush, and she coude eke Wrastlen by verray force and verray might With any yong man, were he never so wight; Ther mighte no-thing in hir armes stonde. She kepte hir maydenhod from every wight, To no man deigned hir for to be bonde. But atte laste hir frendes han hir maried To Odenake, a prince of that contree, Al were it so that she hem longe taried; And ye shul understonde how that he Hadde swiche fantasyes as hadde she. But nathelees, whan they were knit in-fere, They lived in Ioye and in felicitee; For ech of hem hadde other leef and dere. Save o thing, that she never wolde assente By no wey, that he sholde by hir lye But ones, for it was hir pleyn entente To have a child, the world to multiplye; And al-so sone as that she mighte espye That she was nat with childe with that dede, Than wolde she suffre him doon his fantasye Eft-sone, and nat but ones, out of drede. And if she were with childe at thilke cast, Na-more sholde he pleyen thilke game Til fully fourty dayes weren past; Than wolde she ones suffre him do the same. Al were this Odenake wilde or tame, He gat na-more of hir, for thus she seyde, ‘It was to wyves lecherye and shame In other cas, if that men with hem pleyde.’ Two sones by this Odenake hadde she, The whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure; But now un-to our tale turne we. I seye, so worshipful a creature, And wys therwith, and large with mesure, So penible in the werre, and curteis eke, Ne more labour mighte in werre endure, Was noon, thogh al this world men sholde seke. Hir riche array ne mighte nat be told As wel in vessel as in hir clothing; She was al clad in perree and in gold, And eek she lafte noght, for noon hunting, To have of sondry tonges ful knowing, Whan that she leyser hadde, and for to entende To lernen bokes was al hir lyking, How she in vertu mighte hir lyf dispende. And, shortly of this storie for to trete, So doughty was hir housbonde and eek she, That they conquered many regnes grete In the orient, with many a fair citee, Apertenaunt un-to the magestee Of Rome, and with strong hond helde hem ful faste; Ne never mighte hir fo-men doon hem flee, Ay whyl that Odenakes dayes laste. Hir batailes, who-so list hem for to rede, Agayn Sapor the king and othere mo, And how that al this proces fil in dede, Why she conquered and what title had therto, And after of hir meschief and hir wo, How that she was biseged and y-take, Let him un-to my maister Petrark go, That writ y-nough of this, I undertake. When Odenake was deed, she mightily The regnes heeld, and with hir propre honde Agayn hir foos she faught so cruelly, That her nas king ne prince in al that londe That he nas glad, if that he grace fonde, That she ne wolde up-on his lond werreye; With hir they made alliaunce by bonde To been in pees, and lete hir ryde and pleye. The emperour of Rome, Claudius, Ne him bifore, the Romayn Galien, Ne dorste never been so corageous, Ne noon Ermyn, ne noon Egipcien, Ne Surrien, ne noon Arabien, Within the feld that dorste with hir fighte Lest that she wolde hem with hir hondes slen, Or with hir meynee putten hem to flighte. In kinges habit wente hir sones two, As heires of hir fadres regnes alle, And Hermanno, and Thymalaö Her names were, as Persiens hem calle. But ay fortune hath in hir hony galle; This mighty quene may no whyl endure. Fortune out of hir regne made hir falle To wrecchednesse and to misaventure. Aurelian, whan that the governaunce Of Rome cam in-to his hondes tweye, He shoop up-on this queen to do vengeaunce, And with his legiouns he took his weye Toward Cenobie, and, shortly for to seye, He made hir flee, and atte laste hir hente, And fettred hir, and eek hir children tweye, And wan the lond, and hoom to Rome he wente. Amonges othere thinges that he wan, Hir char, that was with gold wrought and perree, This grete Romayn, this Aurelian, Hath with him lad, for that men sholde it see. Biforen his triumphe walketh she With gilte cheynes on hir nekke hanging; Corouned was she, as after hir degree, And ful of perree charged hir clothing. Allas, fortune! she that whylom was Dredful to kinges and to emperoures, Now gaureth al the peple on hir, allas! And she that helmed was in starke stoures, And wan by force tounes stronge and toures, Shal on hir heed now were a vitremyte; And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures Shal bere a distaf, hir cost for to quyte. De Petro Rege Ispannie. O noble, o worthy Petro, glorie of Spayne, Whom fortune heeld so hy in magestee, Wel oughten men thy pitous deeth complayne! Out of thy lond thy brother made thee flee; And after, at a sege, by subtiltee, Thou were bitrayed, and lad un-to his tente, Wher-as he with his owene hond slow thee, Succeding in thy regne and in thy rente. The feeld of snow, with thegle of blak ther-inne, Caught with the lymrod, coloured as the glede, He brew this cursednes and al this sinne. The ‘wikked nest’ was werker of this nede; Noght Charles Oliver, that ay took hede Of trouthe and honour, but of Armorike Genilon Oliver, corrupt for mede, Broghte this worthy king in swich a brike. De Petro Rege de Cipro. O worthy Petro, king of Cypre, also, That Alisaundre wan by heigh maistrye, Ful many a hethen wroghtestow ful wo, Of which thyn owene liges hadde envye, And, for no thing but for thy chivalrye, They in thy bedde han slayn thee by the morwe. Thus can fortune hir wheel governe and gye, And out of Ioye bringe men to sorwe. De Barnabo de Lumbardia. Of Melan grete Barnabo Viscounte, God of delyt, and scourge of Lumbardye, Why sholde I nat thyn infortune acounte, Sith in estaat thou clombe were so hye? Thy brother sone, that was thy double allye, For he thy nevew was, and sone-in-lawe, With-inne his prisoun made thee to dye; But why, ne how, noot I that thou were slawe. De Hugelino, Comite de Pize. Of the erl Hugelyn of Pyse the langour Ther may no tonge telle for pitee; But litel out of Pyse stant a tour, In whiche tour in prisoun put was he, And with him been his litel children three. The eldeste scarsly fyf yeer was of age. Allas, fortune! it was greet crueltee Swiche briddes for to putte in swiche a cage! Dampned was he to deye in that prisoun, For Roger, which that bisshop was of Pyse, Hadde on him maad a fals suggestioun, Thurgh which the peple gan upon him ryse, And putten him to prisoun in swich wyse As ye han herd, and mete and drink he hadde So smal, that wel unnethe it may suffyse, And therwith-al it was ful povre and badde. And on a day bifil that, in that hour, Whan that his mete wont was to be broght, The gayler shette the dores of the tour. He herde it wel,—but he spak right noght, And in his herte anon ther fil a thoght, That they for hunger wolde doon him dyen. ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘allas! that I was wroght!’ Therwith the teres fillen from his yën. His yonge sone, that three yeer was of age, Un-to him seyde, ‘fader, why do ye wepe? Whan wol the gayler bringen our potage, Is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe? I am so hungry that I may nat slepe. Now wolde god that I mighte slepen ever! Than sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe; Ther is no thing, save breed, that me were lever.’ Thus day by day this child bigan to crye, Til in his fadres barme adoun it lay, And seyde, ‘far-wel, fader, I moot dye,’ And kiste his fader, and deyde the same day. And whan the woful fader deed it sey, For wo his armes two he gan to byte, And seyde, ‘allas, fortune! and weylaway! Thy false wheel my wo al may I wyte!’ His children wende that it for hunger was That he his armes gnow, and nat for wo, And seyde, ‘fader, do nat so, allas! But rather eet the flesh upon us two; Our flesh thou yaf us, tak our flesh us fro And eet y-nough:’ right thus they to him seyde, And after that, with-in a day or two, They leyde hem in his lappe adoun, and deyde. Him-self, despeired, eek for hunger starf; Thus ended is this mighty Erl of Pyse; From heigh estaat fortune awey him carf. Of this Tragedie it oghte y-nough suffyse. Who-so wol here it in a lenger wyse, Redeth the grete poete of Itaille, That highte Dant, for he can al devyse Fro point to point, nat o word wol he faille. Nero. Al-though that Nero were as vicious As any feend that lyth ful lowe adoun, Yet he, as telleth us Swetonius, This wyde world hadde in subieccioun, Both Est and West, South and Septemtrioun; Of rubies, saphires, and of perles whyte Were alle his clothes brouded up and doun; For he in gemmes greetly gan delyte. More delicat, more pompous of array, More proud was never emperour than he; That ilke cloth, that he had wered o day, After that tyme he nolde it never see. Nettes of gold-thred hadde he gret plentee To fisshe in Tybre, whan him liste pleye. His lustes were al lawe in his decree, For fortune as his freend him wolde obeye. He Rome brende for his delicacye; The senatours he slow up-on a day. To here how men wolde wepe and crye; And slow his brother, and by his sister lay. His moder made he in pitous array; For he hir wombe slitte, to biholde Wher he conceyved was; so weilawey! That he so litel of his moder tolde! No tere out of his yën for that sighte Ne cam, but seyde, ‘a fair womman was she.’ Gret wonder is, how that he coude or mighte Be domesman of hir dede beautee. The wyn to bringen him comaunded he, And drank anon; non other wo he made. Whan might is Ioyned un-to crueltee, Allas! to depe wol the venim wade! In youthe a maister hadde this emperour, To teche him letterure and curteisye, For of moralitee he was the flour, As in his tyme, but-if bokes lye; And whyl this maister hadde of him maistrye, He maked him so conning and so souple That longe tyme it was er tirannye Or any vyce dorste on him uncouple. This Seneca, of which that I devyse, By-cause Nero hadde of him swich drede, For he fro vyces wolde him ay chastyse Discreetly as by worde and nat by dede;— ‘Sir,’ wolde he seyn, ‘an emperour moot nede Be vertuous, and hate tirannye’— For which he in a bath made him to blede On bothe his armes, til he moste dye. This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce In youthe ageyn his maister for to ryse, Which afterward him thoughte a greet grevaunce; Therfor he made him deyen in this wyse. But natheles this Seneca the wyse Chees in a bath to deye in this manere Rather than han another tormentyse; And thus hath Nero slayn his maister dere. Now fil it so that fortune list no lenger The hye pryde of Nero to cheryce; For though that he were strong, yet was she strenger; She thoughte thus, ‘by god, I am to nyce To sette a man that is fulfild of vyce In heigh degree, and emperour him calle. By god, out of his sete I wol him tryce; When he leest weneth, sonest shal he falle.’ The peple roos up-on him on a night For his defaute, and whan he it espyed, Out of his dores anon he hath him dight Alone, and, ther he wende han ben allyed, He knokked faste, and ay, the more he cryed, The faster shette they the dores alle; Tho wiste he wel he hadde him-self misgyed, And wente his wey, no lenger dorste he calle. The peple cryde and rombled up and doun, That with his eres herde he how they seyde, ‘Wher is this false tyraunt, this Neroun?’ For fere almost out of his wit he breyde, And to his goddes pitously he preyde For socour, but it mighte nat bityde. For drede of this, him thoughte that he deyde, And ran in-to a gardin, him to hyde. And in this gardin fond he cherles tweye That seten by a fyr ful greet and reed, And to thise cherles two he gan to preye To sleen him, and to girden of his heed, That to his body, whan that he were deed, Were no despyt y-doon, for his defame. Him-self he slow, he coude no better reed, Of which fortune lough, and hadde a game. De Oloferno (Holofernes). Was never capitayn under a king That regnes mo putte in subieccioun, Ne strenger was in feeld of alle thing, As in his tyme, ne gretter of renoun, Ne more pompous in heigh presumpcioun Than Oloferne, which fortune ay kiste So likerously, and ladde him up and doun Til that his heed was of, er that he wiste. Nat only that this world hadde him in awe For lesinge of richesse or libertee, But he made every man reneye his lawe. ‘Nabugodonosor was god,’ seyde he, ‘Noon other god sholde adoured be.’ Ageyns his heste no wight dar trespace Save in Bethulia, a strong citee, Wher Eliachim a prest was of that place. But tak kepe of the deeth of Olofern; Amidde his host he dronke lay a night, With-inne his tente, large as is a bern, And yit, for al his pompe and al his might, Iudith, a womman, as he lay upright, Sleping, his heed of smoot, and from his tente Ful prively she stal from every wight, And with his heed unto hir toun she wente. De Rege Anthiocho illustri. What nedeth it of King Anthiochus To telle his hye royal magestee, His hye pryde, his werkes venimous? For swich another was ther noon as he. Rede which that he was in Machabee, And rede the proude wordes that he seyde, And why he fil fro heigh prosperitee, And in an hil how wrechedly he deyde. Fortune him hadde enhaunced so in pryde That verraily he wende he mighte attayne Unto the sterres, upon every syde, And in balance weyen ech montayne, And alle the flodes of the see restrayne. And goddes peple hadde he most in hate, Hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne, Wening that god ne mighte his pryde abate. And for that Nichanor and Thimothee Of Iewes weren venquisshed mightily, Unto the Iewes swich an hate hadde he That he bad greithe his char ful hastily, And swoor, and seyde, ful despitously, Unto Ierusalem he wolde eft-sone, To wreken his ire on it ful cruelly; But of his purpos he was let ful sone. God for his manace him so sore smoot With invisible wounde, ay incurable, That in his guttes carf it so and boot That his peynes weren importable. And certeinly, the wreche was resonable, For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne; But from his purpos cursed and dampnable For al his smert he wolde him nat restreyne; But bad anon apparaillen his host, And sodeynly, er he of it was war, God daunted al his pryde and al his bost. For he so sore fil out of his char, That it his limes and his skin to-tar, So that he neither mighte go ne ryde, But in a chayer men aboute him bar, Al for-brused, bothe bak and syde. The wreche of god him smoot so cruelly That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte; And ther-with-al he stank so horribly, That noon of al his meynee that him kepte, Whether so he wook or elles slepte, Ne mighte noght for stink of him endure. In this meschief he wayled and eek wepte, And knew god lord of every creature. To al his host and to him-self also Ful wlatsom was the stink of his careyne; No man ne mighte him bere to ne fro. And in this stink and this horrible peyne He starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne. Thus hath this robbour and this homicyde, That many a man made to wepe and pleyne, Swich guerdon as bilongeth unto pryde. De Alexandro. The storie of Alisaundre is so comune, That every wight that hath discrecioun Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune. This wyde world, as in conclusioun, He wan by strengthe, or for his hye renoun They weren glad for pees un-to him sende. The pryde of man and beste he leyde adoun, Wher-so he cam, un-to the worldes ende. Comparisoun might never yit be maked Bitwixe him and another conquerour; For al this world for drede of him hath quaked, He was of knighthode and of fredom flour; Fortune him made the heir of hir honour; Save wyn and wommen, no-thing mighte aswage His hye entente in armes and labour; So was he ful of leonyn corage. What preys were it to him, though I yow tolde Of Darius, and an hundred thousand mo, Of kinges, princes, erles, dukes bolde, Whiche he conquered, and broghte hem in-to wo? I seye, as fer as man may ryde or go, The world was his, what sholde I more devyse? For though I write or tolde you evermo Of his knighthode, it mighte nat suffyse. Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee; Philippes sone of Macedoyne he was, That first was king in Grece the contree. O worthy gentil Alisaundre, allas! That ever sholde fallen swich a cas! Empoisoned of thyn owene folk thou were; Thy sys fortune hath turned into as, And yit for thee ne weep she never a tere! Who shal me yeven teres to compleyne The deeth of gentillesse and of fraunchyse, That al the world welded in his demeyne, And yit him thoughte it mighte nat suffyse? So ful was his corage of heigh empryse. Allas! who shal me helpe to endyte False fortune, and poison to despyse, The whiche two of al this wo I wyte? De Iulio Cesare. By wisdom, manhede, and by greet labour Fro humble bed to royal magestee, Up roos he, Iulius the conquerour, That wan al thoccident by lond and see, By strengthe of hond, or elles by tretee, And un-to Rome made hem tributarie; And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he, Til that fortune wex his adversarie. O mighty Cesar, that in Thessalye Ageyn Pompeius, fader thyn in lawe, That of thorient hadde al the chivalrye As fer as that the day biginneth dawe, Thou thurgh thy knighthode hast hem take and slawe, Save fewe folk that with Pompeius fledde, Thurgh which thou puttest al thorient in awe. Thanke fortune, that so wel thee spedde! But now a litel whyl I wol biwaille This Pompeius, this noble governour Of Rome, which that fleigh at this bataille; I seye, oon of his men, a fals traitour, His heed of smoot, to winnen him favour Of Iulius, and him the heed he broghte. Allas, Pompey, of thorient conquerour, That fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte! To Rome ageyn repaireth Iulius With his triumphe, laureat ful hye, But on a tyme Brutus Cassius, That ever hadde of his hye estaat envye, Ful prively hath maad conspiracye Ageins this Iulius, in subtil wyse, And cast the place, in whiche he sholde dye With boydekins, as I shal yow devyse. This Iulius to the Capitolie wente Upon a day, as he was wont to goon, And in the Capitolie anon him hente This false Brutus, and his othere foon, And stikede him with boydekins anoon With many a wounde, and thus they lete him lye; But never gronte he at no strook but oon, Or elles at two, but-if his storie lye. So manly was this Iulius at herte And so wel lovede estaatly honestee, That, though his deedly woundes sore smerte, His mantel over his hippes casteth he, For no man sholde seen his privitee. And, as he lay on deying in a traunce, And wiste verraily that deed was he, Of honestee yit hadde he remembraunce. Lucan, to thee this storie I recomende, And to Sweton, and to Valerie also, That of this storie wryten word and ende, How that to thise grete conqueroures two Fortune was first freend, and sithen fo. No man ne truste up-on hir favour longe, But have hir in awayt for ever-mo. Witnesse on alle thise conqueroures stronge. Cresus. This riche Cresus, whylom king of Lyde, Of whiche Cresus Cyrus sore him dradde, Yit was he caught amiddes al his pryde, And to be brent men to the fyr him ladde. But swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde That slow the fyr, and made him to escape; But to be war no grace yet he hadde, Til fortune on the galwes made him gape. Whan he escaped was, he can nat stente For to biginne a newe werre agayn. He wende wel, for that fortune him sente Swich hap, that he escaped thurgh the rayn, That of his foos he mighte nat be slayn; And eek a sweven up-on a night he mette, Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn, That in vengeaunce he al his herte sette. Up-on a tree he was, as that him thoughte, Ther Iuppiter him wesh, bothe bak and syde, And Phebus eek a fair towaille him broughte To drye him with, and ther-for wex his pryde; And to his doghter, that stood him bisyde, Which that he knew in heigh science habounde, He bad hir telle him what it signifyde, And she his dreem bigan right thus expounde. ‘The tree,’ quod she, ‘the galwes is to mene, And Iuppiter bitokneth snow and reyn, And Phebus, with his towaille so clene, Tho ben the sonne stremes for to seyn; Thou shalt anhanged be, fader, certeyn; Reyn shal thee wasshe, and sonne shal thee drye;’ Thus warned she him ful plat and ful pleyn, His doughter, which that called was Phanye. Anhanged was Cresus, the proude king, His royal trone mighte him nat availle.— Tragedie is noon other maner thing, Ne can in singing crye ne biwaille, But for that fortune alwey wol assaille With unwar strook the regnes that ben proude; For when men trusteth hir, than wol she faille, And covere hir brighte face with a cloude. Explicit Tragedia. Here stinteth the Knight the Monk of his Tale. THE PROLOGUE OF THE NONNE PRESTES TALE. The prologue of the Nonne Preestes Tale. ‘Ho!’ quod the knight, ‘good sir, na-more of this, That ye han seyd is right y-nough, y-wis, And mochel more; for litel hevinesse Is right y-nough to mochel folk, I gesse. I seye for me, it is a greet disese Wher-as men han ben in greet welthe and ese, To heren of hir sodeyn fal, allas! And the contrarie is Ioie and greet solas, As whan a man hath been in povre estaat, And clymbeth up, and wexeth fortunat, And ther abydeth in prosperitee, Swich thing is gladsom, as it thinketh me, And of swich thing were goodly for to telle.’ ‘Ye,’ quod our hoste, ‘by seint Poules belle, Ye seye right sooth; this monk, he clappeth loude, He spak how “fortune covered with a cloude” I noot never what, and als of a “Tragedie” Right now ye herde, and parde! no remedie It is for to biwaille, ne compleyne That that is doon, and als it is a peyne, As ye han seyd, to here of hevinesse. Sir monk, na-more of this, so god yow blesse! Your tale anoyeth al this companye; Swich talking is nat worth a boterflye; For ther-in is ther no desport ne game. Wherfor, sir Monk, or dan Piers by your name, I preye yow hertely, telle us somwhat elles, For sikerly, nere clinking of your belles, That on your brydel hange on every syde, By heven king, that for us alle dyde, I sholde er this han fallen doun for slepe, Although the slough had never been so depe; Than had your tale al be told in vayn. For certeinly, as that thise clerkes seyn, “Wher-as a man may have noon audience, Noght helpeth it to tellen his sentence.” And wel I woot the substance is in me, If any thing shal wel reported be. Sir, sey somwhat of hunting, I yow preye.’ ‘Nay,’ quod this monk, ‘I have no lust to pleye; Now let another telle, as I have told.’ Than spak our host, with rude speche and bold, And seyde un-to the Nonnes Preest anon, ‘Com neer, thou preest, com hider, thou sir Iohn, Tel us swich thing as may our hertes glade, Be blythe, though thou ryde up-on a Iade. What though thyn hors be bothe foule and lene, If he wol serve thee, rekke nat a bene; Look that thyn herte be mery evermo.’ ‘Yis, sir,’ quod he, ‘yis, host, so mote I go, But I be mery, y-wis, I wol be blamed:’— And right anon his tale he hath attamed, And thus he seyde un-to us everichon, This swete preest, this goodly man, sir Iohn. Explicit. THE NONNE PREESTES TALE. Here biginneth the Nonne Preestes Tale of the Cok and Hen, Chauntecleer and Pertelote. A povre widwe, somdel stape in age, Was whylom dwelling in a narwe cotage, Bisyde a grove, stonding in a dale. This widwe, of which I telle yow my tale, Sin thilke day that she was last a wyf, In pacience ladde a ful simple lyf, For litel was hir catel and hir rente; By housbondrye, of such as God hir sente, She fond hir-self, and eek hir doghtren two. Three large sowes hadde she, and namo, Three kyn, and eek a sheep that highte Malle. Ful sooty was hir bour, and eek hir halle, In which she eet ful many a sclendre meel. Of poynaunt sauce hir neded never a deel. No deyntee morsel passed thurgh hir throte; Hir dyete was accordant to hir cote. Repleccioun ne made hir never syk; Attempree dyete was al hir phisyk, And exercyse, and hertes suffisaunce. The goute lette hir no-thing for to daunce, Napoplexye shente nat hir heed; No wyn ne drank she, neither whyt ne reed; Hir bord was served most with whyt and blak, Milk and broun breed, in which she fond no lak, Seynd bacoun, and somtyme an ey or tweye, For she was as it were a maner deye. A yerd she hadde, enclosed al aboute With stikkes, and a drye dich with-oute, In which she hadde a cok, hight Chauntecleer, In al the land of crowing nas his peer. His vois was merier than the mery orgon On messe-dayes that in the chirche gon; Wel sikerer was his crowing in his logge, Than is a clokke, or an abbey orlogge. By nature knew he ech ascencioun Of equinoxial in thilke toun; For whan degrees fiftene were ascended, Thanne crew he, that it mighte nat ben amended. His comb was redder than the fyn coral, And batailed, as it were a castel-wal. His bile was blak, and as the Ieet it shoon; Lyk asur were his legges, and his toon; His nayles whytter than the lilie flour, And lyk the burned gold was his colour. This gentil cok hadde in his governaunce Sevene hennes, for to doon al his plesaunce, Whiche were his sustres and his paramours, And wonder lyk to him, as of colours. Of whiche the faireste hewed on hir throte Was cleped faire damoysele Pertelote. Curteys she was, discreet, and debonaire, And compaignable, and bar hir-self so faire, Sin thilke day that she was seven night old, That trewely she hath the herte in hold Of Chauntecleer loken in every lith; He loved hir so, that wel was him therwith. But such a Ioye was it to here hem singe, Whan that the brighte sonne gan to springe, In swete accord, ‘my lief is faren in londe.’ For thilke tyme, as I have understonde, Bestes and briddes coude speke and singe. And so bifel, that in a daweninge, As Chauntecleer among his wyves alle Sat on his perche, that was in the halle, And next him sat this faire Pertelote, This Chauntecleer gan gronen in his throte, As man that in his dreem is drecched sore. And whan that Pertelote thus herde him rore, She was agast, and seyde, ‘O herte dere, What eyleth yow, to grone in this manere? Ye been a verray sleper, fy for shame!’ And he answerde and seyde thus, ‘madame, I pray yow, that ye take it nat a-grief: By god, me mette I was in swich meschief Right now, that yet myn herte is sore afright. Now god,’ quod he, ‘my swevene recche aright, And keep my body out of foul prisoun! Me mette, how that I romed up and doun Withinne our yerde, wher-as I saugh a beste, Was lyk an hound, and wolde han maad areste Upon my body, and wolde han had me deed. His colour was bitwixe yelwe and reed; And tipped was his tail, and bothe his eres, With blak, unlyk the remenant of his heres; His snowte smal, with glowinge eyen tweye. Yet of his look for fere almost I deye; This caused me my groning, doutelees.’ ‘Avoy!’ quod she, ‘fy on yow, hertelees! Allas!’ quod she, ‘for, by that god above, Now han ye lost myn herte and al my love; I can nat love a coward, by my feith. For certes, what so any womman seith, We alle desyren, if it mighte be, To han housbondes hardy, wyse, and free, And secree, and no nigard, ne no fool, Ne him that is agast of every tool, Ne noon avauntour, by that god above! How dorste ye seyn for shame unto your love, That any thing mighte make yow aferd? Have ye no mannes herte, and han a berd? Allas! and conne ye been agast of swevenis? No-thing, god wot, but vanitee, in sweven is. Swevenes engendren of replecciouns, And ofte of fume, and of complecciouns, Whan humours been to habundant in a wight. Certes this dreem, which ye han met to-night, Cometh of the grete superfluitee Of youre rede colera, pardee, Which causeth folk to dreden in here dremes Of arwes, and of fyr with rede lemes, Of grete bestes, that they wol hem byte, Of contek, and of whelpes grete and lyte; Right as the humour of malencolye Causeth ful many a man, in sleep, to crye, For fere of blake beres, or boles blake, Or elles, blake develes wole hem take. Of othere humours coude I telle also, That werken many a man in sleep ful wo; But I wol passe as lightly as I can. Lo Catoun, which that was so wys a man, Seyde he nat thus, ne do no fors of dremes? Now, sire,’ quod she, ‘whan we flee fro the bemes, For Goddes love, as tak som laxatyf; Up peril of my soule, and of my lyf, I counseille yow the beste, I wol nat lye, That bothe of colere and of malencolye Ye purge yow; and for ye shul nat tarie, Though in this toun is noon apotecarie, I shal my-self to herbes techen yow, That shul ben for your hele, and for your prow; And in our yerd tho herbes shal I finde, The whiche han of hir propretee, by kinde, To purgen yow binethe, and eek above. Forget not this, for goddes owene love! Ye been ful colerik of compleccioun. Ware the sonne in his ascencioun Ne fynde yow nat repleet of humours hote; And if it do, I dar wel leye a grote, That ye shul have a fevere terciane, Or an agu, that may be youre bane. A day or two ye shul have digestyves Of wormes, er ye take your laxatyves, Of lauriol, centaure, and fumetere, Or elles of ellebor, that groweth there, Of catapuce, or of gaytres beryis, Of erbe yve, growing in our yerd, that mery is; Pekke hem up right as they growe, and ete hem in. Be mery, housbond, for your fader kin! Dredeth no dreem; I can say yow na-more.’ ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘graunt mercy of your lore. But nathelees, as touching daun Catoun, That hath of wisdom such a greet renoun, Though that he bad no dremes for to drede, By god, men may in olde bokes rede Of many a man, more of auctoritee Than ever Catoun was, so mote I thee, Than al the revers seyn of his sentence, And han wel founden by experience, That dremes ben significaciouns, As wel of Ioye as tribulaciouns That folk enduren in this lyf present. Ther nedeth make of this noon argument; The verray preve sheweth it in dede. Oon of the gretteste auctours that men rede Seith thus, that whylom two felawes wente On pilgrimage, in a ful good entente; And happed so, thay come into a toun, Wher-as ther was swich congregacioun Of peple, and eek so streit of herbergage, That they ne founde as muche as o cotage, In which they bothe mighte y-logged be. Wherfor thay mosten, of necessitee, As for that night, departen compaignye; And ech of hem goth to his hostelrye, And took his logging as it wolde falle. That oon of hem was logged in a stalle, Fer in a yerd, with oxen of the plough; That other man was logged wel y-nough, As was his aventure, or his fortune, That us governeth alle as in commune. And so bifel, that, longe er it were day, This man mette in his bed, ther-as he lay, How that his felawe gan up-on him calle, And seyde, ‘allas! for in an oxes stalle This night I shal be mordred ther I lye. Now help me, dere brother, er I dye; In alle haste com to me,’ he sayde. This man out of his sleep for fere abrayde; But whan that he was wakned of his sleep, He turned him, and took of this no keep; Him thoughte his dreem nas but a vanitee. Thus twyës in his sleping dremed he. And atte thridde tyme yet his felawe Cam, as him thoughte, and seide, ‘I am now slawe; Bihold my blody woundes, depe and wyde! Arys up erly in the morwe-tyde, And at the west gate of the toun,’ quod he, ‘A carte ful of donge ther shaltow see, In which my body is hid ful prively; Do thilke carte aresten boldely. My gold caused my mordre, sooth to sayn;’ And tolde him every poynt how he was slayn, With a ful pitous face, pale of hewe. And truste wel, his dreem he fond ful trewe; For on the morwe, as sone as it was day, To his felawes in he took the way; And whan that he cam to this oxes stalle, After his felawe he bigan to calle. The hostiler answered him anon, And seyde, ‘sire, your felawe is agon, As sone as day he wente out of the toun.’ This man gan fallen in suspecioun, Remembring on his dremes that he mette, And forth he goth, no lenger wolde he lette, Unto the west gate of the toun, and fond A dong-carte, as it were to donge lond, That was arrayed in the same wyse As ye han herd the dede man devyse; And with an hardy herte he gan to crye Vengeaunce and Iustice of this felonye:— ‘My felawe mordred is this same night, And in this carte he lyth gapinge upright. I crye out on the ministres,’ quod he, ‘That sholden kepe and reulen this citee; Harrow! allas! her lyth my felawe slayn!’ What sholde I more un-to this tale sayn? The peple out-sterte, and caste the cart to grounde, And in the middel of the dong they founde The dede man, that mordred was al newe. O blisful god, that art so Iust and trewe! Lo, how that thou biwreyest mordre alway! Mordre wol out, that see we day by day. Mordre is so wlatsom and abhominable To god, that is so Iust and resonable, That he ne wol nat suffre it heled be; Though it abyde a yeer, or two, or three, Mordre wol out, this my conclusioun. And right anoon, ministres of that toun Han hent the carter, and so sore him pyned, And eek the hostiler so sore engyned, That thay biknewe hir wikkednesse anoon, And were an-hanged by the nekke-boon. Here may men seen that dremes been to drede. And certes, in the same book I rede, Right in the nexte chapitre after this, (I gabbe nat, so have I Ioye or blis,) Two men that wolde han passed over see, For certeyn cause, in-to a fer contree, If that the wind ne hadde been contrarie, That made hem in a citee for to tarie, That stood ful mery upon an haven-syde. But on a day, agayn the even-tyde, The wind gan chaunge, and blew right as hem leste. Iolif and glad they wente un-to hir reste, And casten hem ful erly for to saille; But to that oo man fil a greet mervaille. That oon of hem, in sleping as he lay, Him mette a wonder dreem, agayn the day; Him thoughte a man stood by his beddes syde, And him comaunded, that he sholde abyde, And seyde him thus, ‘if thou to-morwe wende, Thou shalt be dreynt; my tale is at an ende.’ He wook, and tolde his felawe what he mette, And preyde him his viage for to lette; As for that day, he preyde him to abyde. His felawe, that lay by his beddes syde, Gan for to laughe, and scorned him ful faste. ‘No dreem,’ quod he, ‘may so myn herte agaste, That I wol lette for to do my thinges. I sette not a straw by thy dreminges, For swevenes been but vanitees and Iapes. Men dreme al-day of owles or of apes, And eke of many a mase therwithal; Men dreme of thing that nevere was ne shal. But sith I see that thou wolt heer abyde, And thus for-sleuthen wilfully thy tyde, God wot it reweth me; and have good day.’ And thus he took his leve, and wente his way. But er that he hadde halfe his cours y-seyled, Noot I nat why, ne what mischaunce it eyled, But casuelly the shippes botme rente, And ship and man under the water wente In sighte of othere shippes it byside, That with hem seyled at the same tyde. And therfor, faire Pertelote so dere, By swiche ensamples olde maistow lere, That no man sholde been to recchelees Of dremes, for I sey thee, doutelees, That many a dreem ful sore is for to drede. Lo, in the lyf of seint Kenelm, I rede, That was Kenulphus sone, the noble king Of Mercenrike, how Kenelm mette a thing; A lyte er he was mordred, on a day, His mordre in his avisioun he say. His norice him expouned every del His sweven, and bad him for to kepe him wel For traisoun; but he nas but seven yeer old, And therfore litel tale hath he told Of any dreem, so holy was his herte. By god, I hadde lever than my sherte That ye had rad his legende, as have I. Dame Pertelote, I sey yow trewely, Macrobeus, that writ the avisioun In Affrike of the worthy Cipioun, Affermeth dremes, and seith that they been Warning of thinges that men after seen. And forther-more, I pray yow loketh wel In the olde testament, of Daniel, If he held dremes any vanitee. Reed eek of Ioseph, and ther shul ye see Wher dremes ben somtyme (I sey nat alle) Warning of thinges that shul after falle. Loke of Egipt the king, daun Pharao, His bakere and his boteler also, Wher they ne felte noon effect in dremes. Who-so wol seken actes of sondry remes, May rede of dremes many a wonder thing. Lo Cresus, which that was of Lyde king, Mette he nat that he sat upon a tree, Which signified he sholde anhanged be? Lo heer Andromacha, Ectores wyf, That day that Ector sholde lese his lyf, She dremed on the same night biforn, How that the lyf of Ector sholde be lorn, If thilke day he wente in-to bataille; She warned him, but it mighte nat availle; He wente for to fighte nathelees, But he was slayn anoon of Achilles. But thilke tale is al to long to telle, And eek it is ny day, I may nat dwelle. Shortly I seye, as for conclusioun, That I shal han of this avisioun Adversitee; and I seye forther-more, That I ne telle of laxatyves no store, For they ben venimous, I woot it wel; I hem defye, I love hem never a del. Now let us speke of mirthe, and stinte al this; Madame Pertelote, so have I blis, Of o thing god hath sent me large grace; For whan I see the beautee of your face, Ye ben so scarlet-reed about your yën, It maketh al my drede for to dyen; For, also siker as In principio, Mulier est hominis confusio; Madame, the sentence of this Latin is— Womman is mannes Ioye and al his blis. For whan I fele a-night your softe syde, Al-be-it that I may nat on you ryde, For that our perche is maad so narwe, alas! I am so ful of Ioye and of solas That I defye bothe sweven and dreem.’ And with that word he fley doun fro the beem, For it was day, and eek his hennes alle; And with a chuk he gan hem for to calle, For he had founde a corn, lay in the yerd. Royal he was, he was namore aferd; He fethered Pertelote twenty tyme, And trad as ofte, er that it was pryme. He loketh as it were a grim leoun; And on his toos he rometh up and doun, Him deyned not to sette his foot to grounde. He chukketh, whan he hath a corn y-founde, And to him rennen thanne his wyves alle. Thus royal, as a prince is in his halle, Leve I this Chauntecleer in his pasture; And after wol I telle his aventure. Whan that the month in which the world bigan, That highte March, whan god first maked man, Was complet, and [y]-passed were also, Sin March bigan, thritty dayes and two, Bifel that Chauntecleer, in al his pryde, His seven wyves walking by his syde, Caste up his eyen to the brighte sonne, That in the signe of Taurus hadde y-ronne Twenty degrees and oon, and somwhat more; And knew by kynde, and by noon other lore, That it was pryme, and crew with blisful stevene. ‘The sonne,’ he sayde, ‘is clomben up on hevene Fourty degrees and oon, and more, y-wis. Madame Pertelote, my worldes blis, Herkneth thise blisful briddes how they singe, And see the fresshe floures how they springe; Ful is myn herte of revel and solas.’ But sodeinly him fil a sorweful cas; For ever the latter ende of Ioye is wo. God woot that worldly Ioye is sone ago; And if a rethor coude faire endyte, He in a cronique saufly mighte it wryte, As for a sovereyn notabilitee. Now every wys man, lat him herkne me; This storie is al-so trewe, I undertake, As is the book of Launcelot de Lake, That wommen holde in ful gret reverence. Now wol I torne agayn to my sentence. A col-fox, ful of sly iniquitee, That in the grove hadde woned yeres three, By heigh imaginacioun forn-cast, The same night thurgh-out the hegges brast Into the yerd, ther Chauntecleer the faire Was wont, and eek his wyves, to repaire; And in a bed of wortes stille he lay, Til it was passed undern of the day, Wayting his tyme on Chauntecleer to falle, As gladly doon thise homicydes alle, That in awayt liggen to mordre men. O false mordrer, lurking in thy den! O newe Scariot, newe Genilon! False dissimilour, O Greek Sinon, That broghtest Troye al outrely to sorwe! O Chauntecleer, acursed be that morwe, That thou into that yerd flough fro the bemes! Thou were ful wel y-warned by thy dremes, That thilke day was perilous to thee. But what that god forwoot mot nedes be, After the opinioun of certeyn clerkis. Witnesse on him, that any perfit clerk is, That in scole is gret altercacioun In this matere, and greet disputisoun, And hath ben of an hundred thousand men. But I ne can not bulte it to the bren, As can the holy doctour Augustyn, Or Boece, or the bishop Bradwardyn, Whether that goddes worthy forwiting Streyneth me nedely for to doon a thing, (Nedely clepe I simple necessitee); Or elles, if free choys be graunted me To do that same thing, or do it noght, Though god forwoot it, er that it was wroght; Or if his witing streyneth nevere a del But by necessitee condicionel. I wol not han to do of swich matere; My tale is of a cok, as ye may here, That took his counseil of his wyf, with sorwe, To walken in the yerd upon that morwe That he had met the dreem, that I yow tolde. Wommennes counseils been ful ofte colde; Wommannes counseil broghte us first to wo, And made Adam fro paradys to go, Ther-as he was ful mery, and wel at ese. But for I noot, to whom it mighte displese, If I counseil of wommen wolde blame, Passe over, for I seyde it in my game. Rede auctours, wher they trete of swich matere, And what thay seyn of wommen ye may here. Thise been the cokkes wordes, and nat myne; I can noon harm of no womman divyne. Faire in the sond, to bathe hir merily, Lyth Pertelote, and alle hir sustres by, Agayn the sonne; and Chauntecleer so free Song merier than the mermayde in the see; For Phisiologus seith sikerly, How that they singen wel and merily. And so bifel that, as he caste his yë, Among the wortes, on a boterflye, He was war of this fox that lay ful lowe. No-thing ne liste him thanne for to crowe, But cryde anon, ‘cok, cok,’ and up he sterte, As man that was affrayed in his herte. For naturelly a beest desyreth flee Fro his contrarie, if he may it see, Though he never erst had seyn it with his yë. This Chauntecleer, whan he gan him espye, He wolde han fled, but that the fox anon Seyde, ‘Gentil sire, allas! wher wol ye gon? Be ye affrayed of me that am your freend? Now certes, I were worse than a feend, If I to yow wolde harm or vileinye. I am nat come your counseil for tespye; But trewely, the cause of my cominge Was only for to herkne how that ye singe. For trewely ye have as mery a stevene As eny aungel hath, that is in hevene; Therwith ye han in musik more felinge Than hadde Boece, or any that can singe. My lord your fader (god his soule blesse!) And eek your moder, of hir gentilesse, Han in myn hous y-been, to my gret ese; And certes, sire, ful fayn wolde I yow plese. But for men speke of singing, I wol saye, So mote I brouke wel myn eyen tweye, Save yow, I herde never man so singe, As dide your fader in the morweninge; Certes, it was of herte, al that he song. And for to make his voys the more strong, He wolde so peyne him, that with bothe his yën He moste winke, so loude he wolde cryen, And stonden on his tiptoon ther-with-al, And strecche forth his nekke long and smal. And eek he was of swich discrecioun, That ther nas no man in no regioun That him in song or wisdom mighte passe. I have wel rad in daun Burnel the Asse, Among his vers, how that ther was a cok, For that a preestes sone yaf him a knok Upon his leg, whyl he was yong and nyce, He made him for to lese his benefyce. But certeyn, ther nis no comparisoun Bitwix the wisdom and discrecioun Of youre fader, and of his subtiltee. Now singeth, sire, for seinte Charitee, Let see, conne ye your fader countrefete?’ This Chauntecleer his winges gan to bete, As man that coude his tresoun nat espye, So was he ravisshed with his flaterye. Allas! ye lordes, many a fals flatour Is in your courtes, and many a losengeour, That plesen yow wel more, by my feith, Than he that soothfastnesse unto yow seith. Redeth Ecclesiaste of flaterye; Beth war, ye lordes, of hir trecherye. This Chauntecleer stood hye up-on his toos, Strecching his nekke, and heeld his eyen cloos, And gan to crowe loude for the nones; And daun Russel the fox sterte up at ones, And by the gargat hente Chauntecleer, And on his bak toward the wode him beer, For yet ne was ther no man that him sewed. O destinee, that mayst nat been eschewed! Allas, that Chauntecleer fleigh fro the bemes! Allas, his wyf ne roghte nat of dremes! And on a Friday fil al this meschaunce. O Venus, that art goddesse of plesaunce, Sin that thy servant was this Chauntecleer, And in thy service dide al his poweer, More for delyt, than world to multiplye, Why woldestow suffre him on thy day to dye? O Gaufred, dere mayster soverayn, That, whan thy worthy king Richard was slayn With shot, compleynedest his deth so sore, Why ne hadde I now thy sentence and thy lore, The Friday for to chyde, as diden ye? (For on a Friday soothly slayn was he.) Than wolde I shewe yow how that I coude pleyne For Chauntecleres drede, and for his peyne. Certes, swich cry ne lamentacioun Was never of ladies maad, whan Ilioun Was wonne, and Pirrus with his streite swerd, Whan he hadde hent king Priam by the berd, And slayn him (as saith us Eneydos), As maden alle the hennes in the clos, Whan they had seyn of Chauntecleer the sighte. But sovereynly dame Pertelote shrighte, Ful louder than dide Hasdrubales wyf, Whan that hir housbond hadde lost his lyf, And that the Romayns hadde brend Cartage; She was so ful of torment and of rage, That wilfully into the fyr she sterte, And brende hir-selven with a stedfast herte. O woful hennes, right so cryden ye, As, whan that Nero brende the citee Of Rome, cryden senatoures wyves, For that hir housbondes losten alle hir lyves; Withouten gilt this Nero hath hem slayn. Now wol I torne to my tale agayn:— This sely widwe, and eek hir doghtres two, Herden thise hennes crye and maken wo, And out at dores sterten they anoon, And syen the fox toward the grove goon, And bar upon his bak the cok away; And cryden, ‘Out! harrow! and weylaway! Ha, ha, the fox!’ and after him they ran, And eek with staves many another man; Ran Colle our dogge, and Talbot, and Gerland, And Malkin, with a distaf in hir hand; Ran cow and calf, and eek the verray hogges So were they fered for berking of the dogges And shouting of the men and wimmen eke, They ronne so, hem thoughte hir herte breke. They yelleden as feendes doon in helle; The dokes cryden as men wolde hem quelle; The gees for fere flowen over the trees; Out of the hyve cam the swarm of bees; So hidous was the noyse, a! benedicite! Certes, he Iakke Straw, and his meynee, Ne made never shoutes half so shrille, Whan that they wolden any Fleming kille, As thilke day was maad upon the fox. Of bras thay broghten bemes, and of box, Of horn, of boon, in whiche they blewe and pouped, And therwithal thay shryked and they houped; It semed as that heven sholde falle. Now, gode men, I pray yow herkneth alle! Lo, how fortune turneth sodeinly The hope and pryde eek of hir enemy! This cok, that lay upon the foxes bak, In al his drede, un-to the fox he spak, And seyde, ‘sire, if that I were as ye, Yet sholde I seyn (as wis god helpe me), Turneth agayn, ye proude cherles alle! A verray pestilence up-on yow falle! Now am I come un-to this wodes syde, Maugree your heed, the cok shal heer abyde; I wol him ete in feith, and that anon.’— The fox answerde, ‘in feith, it shal be don,’— And as he spak that word, al sodeinly This cok brak from his mouth deliverly, And heighe up-on a tree he fleigh anon. And whan the fox saugh that he was y-gon, ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘O Chauntecleer, allas! I have to yow,’ quod he, ‘y-doon trespas, In-as-muche as I maked yow aferd, Whan I yow hente, and broghte out of the yerd; But, sire, I dide it in no wikke entente; Com doun, and I shal telle yow what I mente. I shal seye sooth to yow, god help me so.’ ‘Nay than,’ quod he, ‘I shrewe us bothe two, And first I shrewe my-self, bothe blood and bones, If thou bigyle me ofter than ones. Thou shalt na-more, thurgh thy flaterye, Do me to singe and winke with myn yë. For he that winketh, whan he sholde see, Al wilfully, god lat him never thee!’ ‘Nay,’ quod the fox, ‘but god yeve him meschaunce, That is so undiscreet of governaunce, That Iangleth whan he sholde holde his pees.’ Lo, swich it is for to be recchelees, And necligent, and truste on flaterye. But ye that holden this tale a folye, As of a fox, or of a cok and hen, Taketh the moralitee, good men. For seint Paul seith, that al that writen is, To our doctryne it is y-write, y-wis. Taketh the fruyt, and lat the chaf be stille. Now, gode god, if that it be thy wille, As seith my lord, so make us alle good men; And bringe us to his heighe blisse. Amen. Here is ended the Nonne Preestes Tale. EPILOGUE TO THE NONNE PREESTES TALE. ‘Sir Nonnes Preest,’ our hoste seyde anoon, ‘Y-blessed be thy breche, and every stoon! This was a mery tale of Chauntecleer. But, by my trouthe, if thou were seculer, Thou woldest been a trede-foul a-right. For, if thou have corage as thou hast might, Thee were nede of hennes, as I wene, Ya, mo than seven tymes seventene. See, whiche braunes hath this gentil Preest, So greet a nekke, and swich a large breest! He loketh as a sperhauk with his yën; Him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen With brasil, ne with greyn of Portingale. Now sire, faire falle yow for youre tale!’ And after that he, with ful mery chere, Seide to another, as ye shullen here. GROUP C. THE PHISICIENS TALE. Here folweth the Phisiciens Tale. Ther was, as telleth Titus Livius, A knight that called was Virginius, Fulfild of honour and of worthinesse, And strong of freendes and of greet richesse. This knight a doghter hadde by his wyf, No children hadde he mo in al his lyf. Fair was this mayde in excellent beautee Aboven every wight that man may see; For nature hath with sovereyn diligence Y-formed hir in so greet excellence, As though she wolde seyn, ‘lo! I, Nature, Thus can I forme and peynte a creature, Whan that me list; who can me countrefete? Pigmalion noght, though he ay forge and bete, Or grave, or peynte; for I dar wel seyn, Apelles, Zanzis, sholde werche in veyn, Outher to grave or peynte or forge or bete, If they presumed me to countrefete. For he that is the former principal Hath maked me his vicaire general, To forme and peynten erthely creaturis Right as me list, and ech thing in my cure is Under the mone, that may wane and waxe, And for my werk right no-thing wol I axe; My lord and I ben ful of oon accord; I made hir to the worship of my lord. So do I alle myne othere creatures, What colour that they han, or what figures.’— Thus semeth me that Nature wolde seye. This mayde of age twelf yeer was and tweye, In which that Nature hadde swich delyt. For right as she can peynte a lilie whyt And reed a rose, right with swich peynture She peynted hath this noble creature Er she were born, up-on hir limes free, Wher-as by right swiche colours sholde be; And Phebus dyed hath hir tresses grete Lyk to the stremes of his burned hete. And if that excellent was hir beautee, A thousand-fold more vertuous was she. In hir ne lakked no condicioun, That is to preyse, as by discrecioun. As wel in goost as body chast was she; For which she floured in virginitee With alle humilitee and abstinence, With alle attemperaunce and pacience, With mesure eek of bering and array. Discreet she was in answering alway; Though she were wys as Pallas, dar I seyn, Hir facound eek ful wommanly and pleyn, No countrefeted termes hadde she To seme wys; but after hir degree She spak, and alle hir wordes more and lesse Souninge in vertu and in gentillesse. Shamfast she was in maydens shamfastnesse, Constant in herte, and ever in bisinesse To dryve hir out of ydel slogardye. Bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrye; For wyn and youthe doon Venus encrece, As men in fyr wol casten oile or grece. And of hir owene vertu, unconstreyned, She hath ful ofte tyme syk hir feyned, For that she wolde fleen the companye Wher lykly was to treten of folye, As is at festes, revels, and at daunces, That been occasions of daliaunces. Swich thinges maken children for to be To sone rype and bold, as men may see, Which is ful perilous, and hath ben yore. For al to sone may she lerne lore Of boldnesse, whan she woxen is a wyf. And ye maistresses in your olde lyf, That lordes doghtres han in governaunce, Ne taketh of my wordes no displesaunce; Thenketh that ye ben set in governinges Of lordes doghtres, only for two thinges; Outher for ye han kept your honestee, Or elles ye han falle in freletee, And knowen wel y-nough the olde daunce, And han forsaken fully swich meschaunce For evermo; therfore, for Cristes sake, To teche hem vertu loke that ye ne slake. A theef of venisoun, that hath forlaft His likerousnesse, and al his olde craft, Can kepe a forest best of any man. Now kepeth hem wel, for if ye wol, ye can; Loke wel that ye un-to no vice assente, Lest ye be dampned for your wikke entente; For who-so doth, a traitour is certeyn. And taketh kepe of that that I shal seyn; Of alle tresons sovereyn pestilence Is whan a wight bitrayseth innocence. Ye fadres and ye modres eek also, Though ye han children, be it oon or two, Your is the charge of al hir surveyaunce, Whyl that they been under your governaunce. Beth war that by ensample of your livinge, Or by your necligence in chastisinge, That they ne perisse; for I dar wel seye, If that they doon, ye shul it dere abeye. Under a shepherde softe and necligent The wolf hath many a sheep and lamb to-rent. Suffyseth oon ensample now as here, For I mot turne agayn to my matere. This mayde, of which I wol this tale expresse, So kepte hir-self, hir neded no maistresse; For in hir living maydens mighten rede, As in a book, every good word or dede, That longeth to a mayden vertuous; She was so prudent and so bountevous. For which the fame out-sprong on every syde Bothe of hir beautee and hir bountee wyde; That thurgh that land they preysed hir echone, That loved vertu, save envye allone, That sory is of other mennes wele, And glad is of his sorwe and his unhele; (The doctour maketh this descripcioun). This mayde up-on a day wente in the toun Toward a temple, with hir moder dere, As is of yonge maydens the manere. Now was ther thanne a Iustice in that toun, That governour was of that regioun. And so bifel, this Iuge his eyen caste Up-on this mayde, avysinge him ful faste, As she cam forby ther this Iuge stood. Anon his herte chaunged and his mood, So was he caught with beautee of this mayde; And to him-self ful prively he sayde, ‘This mayde shal be myn, for any man.’ Anon the feend in-to his herte ran, And taughte him sodeynly, that he by slighte The mayden to his purpos winne mighte. For certes, by no force, ne by no mede, Him thoughte, he was nat able for to spede; For she was strong of freendes, and eek she Confermed was in swich soverayn bountee, That wel he wiste he mighte hir never winne As for to make hir with hir body sinne. For which, by greet deliberacioun, He sente after a cherl, was in the toun, Which that he knew for subtil and for bold. This Iuge un-to this cherl his tale hath told In secree wyse, and made him to ensure, He sholde telle it to no creature, And if he dide, he sholde lese his heed. Whan that assented was this cursed reed, Glad was this Iuge and maked him greet chere, And yaf hym yiftes preciouse and dere. Whan shapen was al hir conspiracye Fro point to point, how that his lecherye Parfourned sholde been ful subtilly, As ye shul here it after openly, Hoom gooth the cherl, that highte Claudius. This false Iuge that highte Apius, So was his name, (for this is no fable, But knowen for historial thing notable, The sentence of it sooth is, out of doute), This false Iuge gooth now faste aboute To hasten his delyt al that he may. And so bifel sone after, on a day, This false Iuge, as telleth us the storie, As he was wont, sat in his consistorie, And yaf his domes up-on sondry cas. This false cherl cam forth a ful greet pas, And seyde, ‘lord, if that it be your wille, As dooth me right up-on this pitous bille, In which I pleyne up-on Virginius. And if that he wol seyn it is nat thus, I wol it preve, and finde good witnesse, That sooth is that my bille wol expresse.’ The Iuge answerde, ‘of this, in his absence, I may nat yeve diffinitif sentence. Lat do him calle, and I wol gladly here; Thou shalt have al right, and no wrong here.’ Virginius cam, to wite the Iuges wille, And right anon was rad this cursed bille; The sentence of it was as ye shul here. ‘To yow, my lord, sire Apius so dere, Sheweth your povre servant Claudius, How that a knight, called Virginius, Agayns the lawe, agayn al equitee, Holdeth, expres agayn the wil of me, My servant, which that is my thral by right, Which fro myn hous was stole up-on a night, Whyl that she was ful yong; this wol I preve By witnesse, lord, so that it nat yow greve. She nis his doghter nat, what so he seye; Wherfore to yow, my lord the Iuge, I preye, Yeld me my thral, if that it be your wille.’ Lo! this was al the sentence of his bille. Virginius gan up-on the cherl biholde, But hastily, er he his tale tolde, And wolde have preved it, as sholde a knight, And eek by witnessing of many a wight, That it was fals that seyde his adversarie, This cursed Iuge wolde no-thing tarie, Ne here a word more of Virginius, But yaf his Iugement, and seyde thus:— ‘I deme anon this cherl his servant have; Thou shalt no lenger in thyn hous hir save. Go bring hir forth, and put hir in our warde, The cherl shal have his thral, this I awarde.’ And whan this worthy knight Virginius, Thurgh sentence of this Iustice Apius, Moste by force his dere doghter yiven Un-to the Iuge, in lecherye to liven, He gooth him hoom, and sette him in his halle, And leet anon his dere doghter calle, And, with a face deed as asshen colde, Upon hir humble face he gan biholde, With fadres pitee stiking thurgh his herte, Al wolde he from his purpos nat converte. ‘Doghter,’ quod he, ‘Virginia, by thy name, Ther been two weyes, outher deeth or shame, That thou most suffre; allas! that I was bore! For never thou deservedest wherfore To dyen with a swerd or with a knyf. O dere doghter, ender of my lyf, Which I have fostred up with swich plesaunce, That thou were never out of my remembraunce! O doghter, which that art my laste wo, And in my lyf my laste Ioye also, O gemme of chastitee, in pacience Take thou thy deeth, for this is my sentence. For love and nat for hate, thou most be deed; My pitous hand mot smyten of thyn heed. Allas! that ever Apius thee say! Thus hath he falsly Iuged thee to-day’— And tolde hir al the cas, as ye bifore Han herd; nat nedeth for to telle it more. ‘O mercy, dere fader,’ quod this mayde, And with that word she both hir armes layde About his nekke, as she was wont to do: The teres broste out of hir eyen two, And seyde, ‘gode fader, shal I dye? Is ther no grace? is ther no remedye?’ ‘No, certes, dere doghter myn,’ quod he. ‘Thanne yif me leyser, fader myn,’ quod she, ‘My deeth for to compleyne a litel space; For pardee, Iepte yaf his doghter grace For to compleyne, er he hir slow, allas! And god it woot, no-thing was hir trespas, But for she ran hir fader first to see, To welcome him with greet solempnitee.’ And with that word she fil aswowne anon, And after, whan hir swowning is agon, She ryseth up, and to hir fader sayde, ‘Blessed be god, that I shal dye a mayde. Yif me my deeth, er that I have a shame; Doth with your child your wil, a goddes name!’ And with that word she preyed him ful ofte, That with his swerd he wolde smyte softe, And with that word aswowne doun she fil. Hir fader, with ful sorweful herte and wil, Hir heed of smoot, and by the top it hente, And to the Iuge he gan it to presente, As he sat yet in doom in consistorie. And whan the Iuge it saugh, as seith the storie, He bad to take him and anhange him faste. But right anon a thousand peple in thraste, To save the knight, for routhe and for pitee, For knowen was the false iniquitee. The peple anon hath suspect of this thing, By manere of the cherles chalanging, That it was by the assent of Apius; They wisten wel that he was lecherous. For which un-to this Apius they gon, And caste him in a prison right anon, Wher-as he slow him-self; and Claudius, That servant was un-to this Apius, Was demed for to hange upon a tree; But that Virginius, of his pitee, So preyde for him that he was exyled; And elles, certes, he had been bigyled. The remenant were anhanged, more and lesse, That were consentant of this cursednesse.— Heer men may seen how sinne hath his meryte! Beth war, for no man woot whom god wol smyte In no degree, ne in which maner wyse The worm of conscience may agryse Of wikked lyf, though it so privee be, That no man woot ther-of but god and he. For be he lewed man, or elles lered, He noot how sone that he shal been afered. Therfore I rede yow this conseil take, Forsaketh sinne, er sinne yow forsake. Here endeth the Phisiciens tale. WORDS OF THE HOST. The wordes of the Host to the Phisicien and the Pardoner. Our Hoste gan to swere as he were wood, ‘Harrow!’ quod he, ‘by nayles and by blood! This was a fals cherl and a fals Iustyse! As shamful deeth as herte may devyse Come to thise Iuges and hir advocas! Algate this sely mayde is slayn, allas! Allas! to dere boghte she beautee! Wherfore I seye al day, as men may see, That yiftes of fortune or of nature Ben cause of deeth to many a creature. Hir beautee was hir deeth, I dar wel sayn; Allas! so pitously as she was slayn! Of bothe yiftes that I speke of now Men han ful ofte more harm than prow. But trewely, myn owene mayster dere, This is a pitous tale for to here. But natheles, passe over, is no fors; I prey to god, so save thy gentil cors, And eek thyne urinals and thy Iordanes, Thyn Ypocras, and eek thy Galianes, And every boist ful of thy letuarie; God blesse hem, and our lady seinte Marie! So mot I theen, thou art a propre man, And lyk a prelat, by seint Ronyan! Seyde I nat wel? I can nat speke in terme; But wel I woot, thou doost my herte to erme, That I almost have caught a cardiacle. By corpus bones! but I have triacle, Or elles a draught of moyste and corny ale, Or but I here anon a mery tale, Myn herte is lost for pitee of this mayde. Thou bel amy, thou Pardoner,’ he seyde, ‘Tel us som mirthe or Iapes right anon.’ ‘It shall be doon,’ quod he, ‘by seint Ronyon! But first,’ quod he, ‘heer at this ale-stake I wol both drinke, and eten of a cake.’ But right anon thise gentils gonne to crye, ‘Nay! lat him telle us of no ribaudye; Tel us som moral thing, that we may lere Som wit, and thanne wol we gladly here.’ ‘I graunte, y-wis,’ quod he, ‘but I mot thinke Up-on som honest thing, whyl that I drinke. THE PROLOGUE OF THE PARDONERS TALE. Here folweth the Prologe of the Pardoners Tale. Radix malorum est Cupiditas: Ad Thimotheum, sexto. Lordings,’ quod he, ‘in chirches whan I preche, I peyne me to han an hauteyn speche, And ringe it out as round as gooth a belle, For I can al by rote that I telle. My theme is alwey oon, and ever was— “Radix malorum est Cupiditas.” First I pronounce whennes that I come, And than my bulles shewe I, alle and somme. Our lige lordes seel on my patente, That shewe I first, my body to warente, That no man be so bold, ne preest ne clerk, Me to destourbe of Cristes holy werk; And after that than telle I forth my tales, Bulles of popes and of cardinales, Of patriarkes, and bishoppes I shewe; And in Latyn I speke a wordes fewe, To saffron with my predicacioun, And for to stire men to devocioun. Than shewe I forth my longe cristal stones, Y-crammed ful of cloutes and of bones; Reliks been they, as wenen they echoon. Than have I in latoun a sholder-boon Which that was of an holy Iewes shepe. “Good men,” seye I, “tak of my wordes kepe; If that this boon be wasshe in any welle, If cow, or calf, or sheep, or oxe swelle That any worm hath ete, or worm y-stonge, Tak water of that welle, and wash his tonge, And it is hool anon; and forthermore, Of pokkes and of scabbe, and every sore Shal every sheep be hool, that of this welle Drinketh a draughte; tak kepe eek what I telle. If that the good-man, that the bestes oweth, Wol every wike, er that the cok him croweth, Fastinge, drinken of this welle a draughte, As thilke holy Iewe our eldres taughte, His bestes and his stoor shal multiplye. And, sirs, also it heleth Ialousye; For, though a man be falle in Ialous rage, Let maken with this water his potage, And never shal he more his wyf mistriste, Though he the sooth of hir defaute wiste; Al had she taken preestes two or three. Heer is a miteyn eek, that ye may see. He that his hond wol putte in this miteyn, He shal have multiplying of his greyn, Whan he hath sowen, be it whete or otes, So that he offre pens, or elles grotes. Good men and wommen, o thing warne I yow, If any wight be in this chirche now, That hath doon sinne horrible, that he Dar nat, for shame, of it y-shriven be, Or any womman, be she yong or old, That hath y-maad hir housbond cokewold, Swich folk shul have no power ne no grace To offren to my reliks in this place. And who-so findeth him out of swich blame, He wol com up and offre in goddes name, And I assoille him by the auctoritee Which that by bulle y-graunted was to me.” By this gaude have I wonne, yeer by yeer, An hundred mark sith I was Pardoner. I stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet, And whan the lewed peple is doun y-set, I preche, so as ye han herd bifore, And telle an hundred false Iapes more. Than peyne I me to strecche forth the nekke, And est and west upon the peple I bekke, As doth a dowve sitting on a berne. Myn hondes and my tonge goon so yerne, That it is Ioye to see my bisinesse. Of avaryce and of swich cursednesse Is al my preching, for to make hem free To yeve her pens, and namely un-to me. For my entente is nat but for to winne, And no-thing for correccioun of sinne. I rekke never, whan that they ben beried, Though that her soules goon a-blakeberied! For certes, many a predicacioun Comth ofte tyme of yvel entencioun; Som for plesaunce of folk and flaterye, To been avaunced by ipocrisye, And som for veyne glorie, and som for hate. For, whan I dar non other weyes debate, Than wol I stinge him with my tonge smerte In preching, so that he shal nat asterte To been defamed falsly, if that he Hath trespased to my brethren or to me. For, though I telle noght his propre name, Men shal wel knowe that it is the same By signes and by othere circumstances. Thus quyte I folk that doon us displesances; Thus spitte I out my venim under hewe Of holynesse, to seme holy and trewe. But shortly myn entente I wol devyse; I preche of no-thing but for coveityse. Therfor my theme is yet, and ever was— “Radix malorum est cupiditas.” Thus can I preche agayn that same vyce Which that I use, and that is avaryce. But, though my-self be gilty in that sinne, Yet can I maken other folk to twinne From avaryce, and sore to repente. But that is nat my principal entente. I preche no-thing but for coveityse; Of this matere it oughte y-nogh suffyse. Than telle I hem ensamples many oon Of olde stories, longe tyme agoon: For lewed peple loven tales olde; Swich thinges can they wel reporte and holde. What? trowe ye, the whyles I may preche, And winne gold and silver for I teche, That I wol live in povert wilfully? Nay, nay, I thoghte it never trewely! For I wol preche and begge in sondry londes; I wol not do no labour with myn hondes, Ne make baskettes, and live therby, Because I wol nat beggen ydelly. I wol non of the apostles counterfete; I wol have money, wolle, chese, and whete, Al were it yeven of the povrest page, Or of the povrest widwe in a village, Al sholde hir children sterve for famyne. Nay! I wol drinke licour of the vyne, And have a Ioly wenche in every toun. But herkneth, lordings, in conclusioun; Your lyking is that I shal telle a tale. Now, have I dronke a draughte of corny ale, By god, I hope I shal yow telle a thing That shal, by resoun, been at your lyking. For, though myself be a ful vicious man, A moral tale yet I yow telle can, Which I am wont to preche, for to winne. Now holde your pees, my tale I wol beginne. THE PARDONERS TALE. Here biginneth the Pardoners Tale. In Flaundres whylom was a companye Of yonge folk, that haunteden folye, As ryot, hasard, stewes, and tavernes, Wher-as, with harpes, lutes, and giternes, They daunce and pleye at dees bothe day and night, And ete also and drinken over hir might, Thurgh which they doon the devel sacrifyse With-in that develes temple, in cursed wyse, By superfluitee abhominable; Hir othes been so grete and so dampnable, That it is grisly for to here hem swere; Our blissed lordes body they to-tere; Hem thoughte Iewes rente him noght y-nough; And ech of hem at otheres sinne lough. And right anon than comen tombesteres Fetys and smale, and yonge fruytesteres, Singers with harpes, baudes, wafereres, Whiche been the verray develes officeres To kindle and blowe the fyr of lecherye, That is annexed un-to glotonye; The holy writ take I to my witnesse, That luxurie is in wyn and dronkenesse. Lo, how that dronken Loth, unkindely, Lay by his doghtres two, unwitingly; So dronke he was, he niste what he wroghte. Herodes, (who-so wel the stories soghte), Whan he of wyn was replet at his feste, Right at his owene table he yaf his heste To sleen the Baptist Iohn ful giltelees. Senek seith eek a good word doutelees; He seith, he can no difference finde Bitwix a man that is out of his minde And a man which that is dronkelewe, But that woodnesse, y-fallen in a shrewe, Persevereth lenger than doth dronkenesse. O glotonye, ful of cursednesse, O cause first of our confusioun, O original of our dampnacioun, Til Crist had boght us with his blood agayn! Lo, how dere, shortly for to sayn, Aboght was thilke cursed vileinye; Corrupt was al this world for glotonye! Adam our fader, and his wyf also, Fro Paradys to labour and to wo Were driven for that vyce, it is no drede; For whyl that Adam fasted, as I rede, He was in Paradys; and whan that he Eet of the fruyt defended on the tree, Anon he was out-cast to wo and peyne. O glotonye, on thee wel oghte us pleyne! O, wiste a man how many maladyes Folwen of excesse and of glotonyes, He wolde been the more mesurable Of his diete, sittinge at his table. Allas! the shorte throte, the tendre mouth, Maketh that, Est and West, and North and South, In erthe, in eir, in water men to-swinke To gete a glotoun deyntee mete and drinke! Of this matere, o Paul, wel canstow trete, ‘Mete un-to wombe, and wombe eek un-to mete, Shal god destroyen bothe,’ as Paulus seith. Allas! a foul thing is it, by my feith, To seye this word, and fouler is the dede, Whan man so drinketh of the whyte and rede, That of his throte he maketh his privee, Thurgh thilke cursed superfluitee. The apostel weping seith ful pitously, ‘Ther walken many of whiche yow told have I, I seye it now weping with pitous voys, That they been enemys of Cristes croys, Of whiche the ende is deeth, wombe is her god.’ O wombe! O bely! O stinking cod, Fulfild of donge and of corrupcioun! At either ende of thee foul is the soun. How greet labour and cost is thee to finde! Thise cokes, how they stampe, and streyne, and grinde, And turnen substaunce in-to accident, To fulfille al thy likerous talent! Out of the harde bones knokke they The mary, for they caste noght a-wey That may go thurgh the golet softe and swote; Of spicerye, of leef, and bark, and rote Shal been his sauce y-maked by delyt, To make him yet a newer appetyt. But certes, he that haunteth swich delyces Is deed, whyl that he liveth in tho vyces. A lecherous thing is wyn, and dronkenesse Is ful of stryving and of wrecchednesse. O dronke man, disfigured is thy face, Sour is thy breeth, foul artow to embrace, And thurgh thy dronke nose semeth the soun As though thou seydest ay ‘Sampsoun, Sampsoun’; And yet, god wot, Sampsoun drank never no wyn. Thou fallest, as it were a stiked swyn; Thy tonge is lost, and al thyn honest cure; For dronkenesse is verray sepulture Of mannes wit and his discrecioun. In whom that drinke hath dominacioun, He can no conseil kepe, it is no drede. Now kepe yow fro the whyte and fro the rede, And namely fro the whyte wyn of Lepe, That is to selle in Fish-strete or in Chepe. This wyn of Spayne crepeth subtilly In othere wynes, growing faste by, Of which ther ryseth swich fumositee, That whan a man hath dronken draughtes three, And weneth that he be at hoom in Chepe, He is in Spayne, right at the toune of Lepe, Nat at the Rochel, ne at Burdeux toun; And thanne wol he seye, ‘Sampsoun, Sampsoun.’ But herkneth, lordings, o word, I yow preye, That alle the sovereyn actes, dar I seye, Of victories in the olde testament, Thurgh verray god, that is omnipotent, Were doon in abstinence and in preyere; Loketh the Bible, and ther ye may it lere. Loke, Attila, the grete conquerour, Deyde in his sleep, with shame and dishonour, Bledinge ay at his nose in dronkenesse; A capitayn shoulde live in sobrenesse. And over al this, avyseth yow right wel What was comaunded un-to Lamuel— Nat Samuel, but Lamuel, seye I— Redeth the Bible, and finde it expresly Of wyn-yeving to hem that han Iustyse. Na-more of this, for it may wel suffyse. And now that I have spoke of glotonye, Now wol I yow defenden hasardrye. Hasard is verray moder of lesinges, And of deceite, and cursed forsweringes, Blaspheme of Crist, manslaughtre, and wast also Of catel and of tyme; and forthermo, It is repreve and contrarie of honour For to ben holde a commune hasardour. And ever the hyër he is of estaat, The more is he holden desolaat. If that a prince useth hasardrye, In alle governaunce and policye He is, as by commune opinioun, Y-holde the lasse in reputacioun. Stilbon, that was a wys embassadour, Was sent to Corinthe, in ful greet honour, Fro Lacidomie, to make hir alliaunce. And whan he cam, him happede, par chaunce, That alle the grettest that were of that lond, Pleyinge atte hasard he hem fond. For which, as sone as it mighte be, He stal him hoom agayn to his contree, And seyde, ‘ther wol I nat lese my name; Ne I wol nat take on me so greet defame, Yow for to allye un-to none hasardours. Sendeth othere wyse embassadours; For, by my trouthe, me were lever dye, Than I yow sholde to hasardours allye. For ye that been so glorious in honours Shul nat allyen yow with hasardours As by my wil, ne as by my tretee.’ This wyse philosophre thus seyde he. Loke eek that, to the king Demetrius The king of Parthes, as the book seith us, Sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn, For he hadde used hasard ther-biforn; For which he heeld his glorie or his renoun At no value or reputacioun. Lordes may finden other maner pley Honeste y-nough to dryve the day awey. Now wol I speke of othes false and grete A word or two, as olde bokes trete. Gret swering is a thing abhominable, And false swering is yet more reprevable. The heighe god forbad swering at al, Witnesse on Mathew; but in special Of swering seith the holy Ieremye, ‘Thou shalt seye sooth thyn othes, and nat lye, And swere in dome, and eek in rightwisnesse;’ But ydel swering is a cursednesse. Bihold and see, that in the firste table Of heighe goddes hestes honurable, How that the seconde heste of him is this— ‘Tak nat my name in ydel or amis.’ Lo, rather he forbedeth swich swering Than homicyde or many a cursed thing; I seye that, as by ordre, thus it stondeth; This knowen, that his hestes understondeth, How that the second heste of god is that. And forther over, I wol thee telle al plat, That vengeance shal nat parten from his hous, That of his othes is to outrageous. ‘By goddes precious herte, and by his nayles, And by the blode of Crist, that it is in Hayles, Seven is my chaunce, and thyn is cink and treye; By goddes armes, if thou falsly pleye, This dagger shal thurgh-out thyn herte go’— This fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two, Forswering, ire, falsnesse, homicyde. Now, for the love of Crist that for us dyde, Leveth your othes, bothe grete and smale; But, sirs, now wol I telle forth my tale. Thise ryotoures three, of whiche I telle, Longe erst er pryme rong of any belle, Were set hem in a taverne for to drinke; And as they satte, they herde a belle clinke Biforn a cors, was caried to his grave; That oon of hem gan callen to his knave, ‘Go bet,’ quod he, ‘and axe redily, What cors is this that passeth heer forby; And look that thou reporte his name wel.’ ‘Sir,’ quod this boy, ‘it nedeth never-a-del. It was me told, er ye cam heer, two houres; He was, pardee, an old felawe of youres; And sodeynly he was y-slayn to-night, For-dronke, as he sat on his bench upright; Ther cam a privee theef, men clepeth Deeth, That in this contree al the peple sleeth, And with his spere he smoot his herte a-two, And wente his wey with-outen wordes mo. He hath a thousand slayn this pestilence: And, maister, er ye come in his presence, Me thinketh that it were necessarie For to be war of swich an adversarie: Beth redy for to mete him evermore. Thus taughte me my dame, I sey na-more.’ ‘By seinte Marie,’ seyde this taverner, ‘The child seith sooth, for he hath slayn this yeer, Henne over a myle, with-in a greet village, Both man and womman, child and hyne, and page. I trowe his habitacioun be there; To been avysed greet wisdom it were, Er that he dide a man a dishonour.’ ‘Ye, goddes armes,’ quod this ryotour, ‘Is it swich peril with him for to mete? I shal him seke by wey and eek by strete, I make avow to goddes digne bones! Herkneth, felawes, we three been al ones; Lat ech of us holde up his hond til other, And ech of us bicomen otheres brother, And we wol sleen this false traytour Deeth; He shal be slayn, which that so many sleeth, By goddes dignitee, er it be night.’ Togidres han thise three her trouthes plight, To live and dyen ech of hem for other, As though he were his owene y-boren brother. And up they sterte al dronken, in this rage, And forth they goon towardes that village, Of which the taverner had spoke biforn, And many a grisly ooth than han they sworn, And Cristes blessed body they to-rente— ‘Deeth shal be deed, if that they may him hente.’ Whan they han goon nat fully half a myle, Right as they wolde han troden over a style, An old man and a povre with hem mette. This olde man ful mekely hem grette, And seyde thus, ‘now, lordes, god yow see!’ The proudest of thise ryotoures three Answerde agayn, ‘what? carl, with sory grace, Why artow al forwrapped save thy face? Why livestow so longe in so greet age?’ This olde man gan loke in his visage, And seyde thus, ‘for I ne can nat finde A man, though that I walked in-to Inde, Neither in citee nor in no village, That wolde chaunge his youthe for myn age; And therfore moot I han myn age stille, As longe time as it is goddes wille. Ne deeth, allas! ne wol nat han my lyf; Thus walke I, lyk a restelees caityf, And on the ground, which is my modres gate, I knokke with my staf, bothe erly and late, And seye, “leve moder, leet me in! Lo, how I vanish, flesh, and blood, and skin! Allas! whan shul my bones been at reste? Moder, with yow wolde I chaunge my cheste, That in my chambre longe tyme hath be, Ye! for an heyre clout to wrappe me!” But yet to me she wol nat do that grace, For which ful pale and welked is my face. But, sirs, to yow it is no curteisye To speken to an old man vileinye, But he trespasse in worde, or elles in dede. In holy writ ye may your-self wel rede, “Agayns an old man, hoor upon his heed, Ye sholde aryse;” wherfor I yeve yow reed, Ne dooth un-to an old man noon harm now, Na-more than ye wolde men dide to yow In age, if that ye so longe abyde; And god be with yow, wher ye go or ryde. I moot go thider as I have to go.’ ‘Nay, olde cherl, by god, thou shalt nat so,’ Seyde this other hasardour anon; ‘Thou partest nat so lightly, by seint Iohn! Thou spak right now of thilke traitour Deeth, That in this contree alle our frendes sleeth. Have heer my trouthe, as thou art his aspye, Tel wher he is, or thou shalt it abye, By god, and by the holy sacrament! For soothly thou art oon of his assent, To sleen us yonge folk, thou false theef!’ ‘Now, sirs,’ quod he, ‘if that yow be so leef To finde Deeth, turne up this croked wey, For in that grove I lafte him, by my fey, Under a tree, and ther he wol abyde; Nat for your boost he wol him no-thing hyde. See ye that ook? right ther ye shul him finde. God save yow, that boghte agayn mankinde, And yow amende!’—thus seyde this olde man. And everich of thise ryotoures ran, Til he cam to that tree, and ther they founde Of florins fyne of golde y-coyned rounde Wel ny an eighte busshels, as hem thoughte. No lenger thanne after Deeth they soughte, But ech of hem so glad was of that sighte, For that the florins been so faire and brighte, That doun they sette hem by this precious hord. The worste of hem he spake the firste word. ‘Brethren,’ quod he, ‘tak kepe what I seye; My wit is greet, though that I bourde and pleye. This tresor hath fortune un-to us yiven, In mirthe and Iolitee our lyf to liven, And lightly as it comth, so wol we spende. Ey! goddes precious dignitee! who wende To-day, that we sholde han so fair a grace? But mighte this gold be caried fro this place Hoom to myn hous, or elles un-to youres— For wel ye woot that al this gold is oures— Than were we in heigh felicitee. But trewely, by daye it may nat be; Men wolde seyn that we were theves stronge, And for our owene tresor doon us honge. This tresor moste y-caried be by nighte As wysly and as slyly as it mighte. Wherfore I rede that cut among us alle Be drawe, and lat se wher the cut wol falle; And he that hath the cut with herte blythe Shal renne to the toune, and that ful swythe, And bringe us breed and wyn ful prively. And two of us shul kepen subtilly This tresor wel; and, if he wol nat tarie, Whan it is night, we wol this tresor carie By oon assent, wher-as us thinketh best.’ That oon of hem the cut broughte in his fest, And bad hem drawe, and loke wher it wol falle; And it fil on the yongeste of hem alle; And forth toward the toun he wente anon. And al-so sone as that he was gon, That oon of hem spak thus un-to that other, ‘Thou knowest wel thou art my sworne brother, Thy profit wol I telle thee anon. Thou woost wel that our felawe is agon; And heer is gold, and that ful greet plentee, That shal departed been among us three. But natheles, if I can shape it so That it departed were among us two, Hadde I nat doon a freendes torn to thee?’ That other answerde, ‘I noot how that may be; He woot how that the gold is with us tweye, What shal we doon, what shal we to him seye?’ ‘Shal it be conseil?’ seyde the firste shrewe, ‘And I shal tellen thee, in wordes fewe, What we shal doon, and bringe it wel aboute.’ ‘I graunte,’ quod that other, ‘out of doute, That, by my trouthe, I wol thee nat biwreye.’ ‘Now,’ quod the firste, ‘thou woost wel we be tweye, And two of us shul strenger be than oon. Look whan that he is set, and right anoon Arys, as though thou woldest with him pleye; And I shal ryve him thurgh the sydes tweye Whyl that thou strogelest with him as in game, And with thy dagger look thou do the same; And than shal al this gold departed be, My dere freend, bitwixen me and thee; Than may we bothe our lustes al fulfille, And pleye at dees right at our owene wille.’ And thus acorded been thise shrewes tweye To sleen the thridde, as ye han herd me seye. This yongest, which that wente un-to the toun, Ful ofte in herte he rolleth up and doun The beautee of thise florins newe and brighte. ‘O lord!’ quod he, ‘if so were that I mighte Have al this tresor to my-self allone, Ther is no man that liveth under the trone Of god, that sholde live so mery as I!’ And atte laste the feend, our enemy, Putte in his thought that he shold poyson beye, With which he mighte sleen his felawes tweye; For-why the feend fond him in swich lyvinge, That he had leve him to sorwe bringe, For this was outrely his fulle entente To sleen hem bothe, and never to repente. And forth he gooth, no lenger wolde he tarie, Into the toun, un-to a pothecarie, And preyed him, that he him wolde selle Som poyson, that he mighte his rattes quelle; And eek ther was a polcat in his hawe, That, as he seyde, his capouns hadde y-slawe, And fayn he wolde wreke him, if he mighte, On vermin, that destroyed him by nighte. The pothecarie answerde, ‘and thou shalt have A thing that, al-so god my soule save, In al this world ther nis no creature, That ete or dronke hath of this confiture Noght but the mountance of a corn of whete, That he ne shal his lyf anon forlete; Ye, sterve he shal, and that in lasse whyle Than thou wolt goon a paas nat but a myle; This poyson is so strong and violent.’ This cursed man hath in his hond y-hent This poyson in a box, and sith he ran In-to the nexte strete, un-to a man, And borwed [of] him large botels three; And in the two his poyson poured he; The thridde he kepte clene for his drinke. For al the night he shoop him for to swinke In caryinge of the gold out of that place. And whan this ryotour, with sory grace, Had filled with wyn his grete botels three, To his felawes agayn repaireth he. What nedeth it to sermone of it more? For right as they had cast his deeth bifore, Right so they han him slayn, and that anon. And whan that this was doon, thus spak that oon, ‘Now lat us sitte and drinke, and make us merie, And afterward we wol his body berie.’ And with that word it happed him, par cas, To take the botel ther the poyson was, And drank, and yaf his felawe drinke also, For which anon they storven bothe two. But, certes, I suppose that Avicen Wroot never in no canon, ne in no fen, Mo wonder signes of empoisoning Than hadde thise wrecches two, er hir ending. Thus ended been thise homicydes two, And eek the false empoysoner also. O cursed sinne, ful of cursednesse! O traytours homicyde, o wikkednesse! O glotonye, luxurie, and hasardrye! Thou blasphemour of Crist with vileinye And othes grete, of usage and of pryde! Allas! mankinde, how may it bityde, That to thy creatour which that thee wroghte, And with his precious herte-blood thee boghte, Thou art so fals and so unkinde, allas! Now, goode men, god forgeve yow your trespas, And ware yow fro the sinne of avaryce. Myn holy pardoun may yow alle waryce, So that ye offre nobles or sterlinges, Or elles silver broches, spones, ringes. Boweth your heed under this holy bulle! Cometh up, ye wyves, offreth of your wolle! Your name I entre heer in my rolle anon; In-to the blisse of hevene shul ye gon; I yow assoile, by myn heigh power, Yow that wol offre, as clene and eek as cleer As ye were born; and, lo, sirs, thus I preche. And Iesu Crist, that is our soules leche, So graunte yow his pardon to receyve; For that is best; I wol yow nat deceyve. But sirs, o word forgat I in my tale, I have relikes and pardon in my male, As faire as any man in Engelond, Whiche were me yeven by the popes hond. If any of yow wol, of devocioun, Offren, and han myn absolucioun, Cometh forth anon, and kneleth heer adoun, And mekely receyveth my pardoun: Or elles, taketh pardon as ye wende, Al newe and fresh, at every tounes ende, So that ye offren alwey newe and newe Nobles and pens, which that be gode and trewe. It is an honour to everich that is heer, That ye mowe have a suffisant pardoneer Tassoille yow, in contree as ye ryde, For aventures which that may bityde. Peraventure ther may falle oon or two Doun of his hors, and breke his nekke atwo. Look which a seuretee is it to yow alle That I am in your felaweship y-falle, That may assoille yow, bothe more and lasse, Whan that the soule shal fro the body passe. I rede that our hoste heer shal biginne, For he is most envoluped in sinne. Com forth, sir hoste, and offre first anon, And thou shalt kisse the reliks everichon, Ye, for a grote! unbokel anon thy purs.’ ‘Nay, nay,’ quod he, ‘than have I Cristes curs! Lat be,’ quod he, ‘it shal nat be, so theech! Thou woldest make me kisse thyn old breech, And swere it were a relik of a seint, Thogh it were with thy fundement depeint! But by the croys which that seint Eleyne fond, I wolde I hadde thy coillons in myn hond In stede of relikes or of seintuarie; Lat cutte hem of, I wol thee helpe hem carie; They shul be shryned in an hogges tord.’ This pardoner answerde nat a word; So wrooth he was, no word ne wolde he seye. ‘Now,’ quod our host, ‘I wol no lenger pleye With thee, ne with noon other angry man.’ But right anon the worthy knight bigan, Whan that he saugh that al the peple lough, ‘Na-more of this, for it is right y-nough; Sir pardoner, be glad and mery of chere; And ye, sir host, that been to me so dere, I prey yow that ye kisse the pardoner. And pardoner, I prey thee, drawe thee neer, And, as we diden, lat us laughe and pleye.’ Anon they kiste, and riden forth hir weye. Here is ended the Pardoners Tale. GROUP D. THE WIFE OF BATH'S PROLOGUE. The Prologe of the Wyves Tale of Bathe. ‘Experience, though noon auctoritee Were in this world, were right y-nough to me To speke of wo that is in mariage; For, lordinges, sith I twelf yeer was of age, Thonked be god that is eterne on lyve, Housbondes at chirche-dore I have had fyve; For I so ofte have y-wedded be; And alle were worthy men in hir degree. But me was told certeyn, nat longe agon is, That sith that Crist ne wente never but onis To wedding in the Cane of Galilee, That by the same ensample taughte he me That I ne sholde wedded be but ones. Herke eek, lo! which a sharp word for the nones Besyde a welle Iesus, god and man, Spak in repreve of the Samaritan: “Thou hast y-had fyve housbondes,” quod he, “And thilke man, the which that hath now thee, Is noght thyn housbond;” thus seyde he certeyn; What that he mente ther-by, I can nat seyn; But that I axe, why that the fifthe man Was noon housbond to the Samaritan? How manye mighte she have in mariage? Yet herde I never tellen in myn age Upon this nombre diffinicioun; Men may devyne and glosen up and doun. But wel I woot expres, with-oute lye, God bad us for to wexe and multiplye; That gentil text can I wel understonde. Eek wel I woot he seyde, myn housbonde Sholde lete fader and moder, and take me; But of no nombre mencioun made he, Of bigamye or of octogamye; Why sholde men speke of it vileinye? Lo, here the wyse king, dan Salomon; I trowe he hadde wyves mo than oon; As, wolde god, it leveful were to me To be refresshed half so ofte as he! Which yifte of god hadde he for alle his wyvis! No man hath swich, that in this world alyve is. God woot, this noble king, as to my wit, The firste night had many a mery fit With ech of hem, so wel was him on lyve! Blessed be god that I have wedded fyve! Welcome the sixte, whan that ever he shal. For sothe, I wol nat kepe me chast in al; Whan myn housbond is fro the world y-gon, Som Cristen man shal wedde me anon; For thanne thapostle seith, that I am free To wedde, a goddes half, wher it lyketh me. He seith that to be wedded is no sinne; Bet is to be wedded than to brinne. What rekketh me, thogh folk seye vileinye Of shrewed Lameth and his bigamye? I woot wel Abraham was an holy man, And Iacob eek, as ferforth as I can; And ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two; And many another holy man also. Whan saugh ye ever, in any maner age, That hye god defended mariage By expres word? I pray you, telleth me; Or wher comanded he virginitee? I woot as wel as ye, it is no drede, Thapostel, whan he speketh of maydenhede; He seyde, that precept ther-of hadde he noon. Men may conseille a womman to been oon, But conseilling is no comandement; He putte it in our owene Iugement. For hadde god comanded maydenhede, Thanne hadde he dampned wedding with the dede; And certes, if ther were no seed y-sowe, Virginitee, wher-of than sholde it growe? Poul dorste nat comanden atte leste A thing of which his maister yaf noon heste. The dart is set up for virginitee; Cacche who so may, who renneth best lat see. But this word is nat take of every wight, But ther as god list give it of his might. I woot wel, that thapostel was a mayde; But natheless, thogh that he wroot and sayde, He wolde that every wight were swich as he, Al nis but conseil to virginitee; And for to been a wyf, he yaf me leve Of indulgence; so it is no repreve To wedde me, if that my make dye, With-oute excepcioun of bigamye. Al were it good no womman for to touche, He mente as in his bed or in his couche; For peril is bothe fyr and tow tassemble; Ye knowe what this ensample may resemble. This is al and som, he heeld virginitee More parfit than wedding in freletee. Freeltee clepe I, but-if that he and she Wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee. I graunte it wel, I have noon envye, Thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye; Hem lyketh to be clene, body and goost, Of myn estaat I nil nat make no boost. For wel ye knowe, a lord in his houshold, He hath nat every vessel al of gold; Somme been of tree, and doon hir lord servyse. God clepeth folk to him in sondry wyse, And everich hath of god a propre yifte, Som this, som that,—as him lyketh shifte. Virginitee is greet perfeccioun, And continence eek with devocioun. But Crist, that of perfeccioun is welle, Bad nat every wight he sholde go selle All that he hadde, and give it to the pore, And in swich wyse folwe him and his fore. He spak to hem that wolde live parfitly; And lordinges, by your leve, that am nat I. I wol bistowe the flour of al myn age In the actes and in fruit of mariage. Telle me also, to what conclusioun Were membres maad of generacioun, And for what profit was a wight y-wroght? Trusteth right wel, they wer nat maad for noght. Glose who-so wole, and seye bothe up and doun, That they were maked for purgacioun Of urine, and our bothe thinges smale Were eek to knowe a femele from a male, And for noon other cause: sey ye no? The experience woot wel it is noght so; So that the clerkes be nat with me wrothe, I sey this, that they maked been for bothe, This is to seye, for office, and for ese Of engendrure, ther we nat god displese. Why sholde men elles in hir bokes sette, That man shal yelde to his wyf hir dette? Now wher-with sholde he make his payement, If he ne used his sely instrument? Than were they maad up-on a creature, To purge uryne, and eek for engendrure. But I seye noght that every wight is holde, That hath swich harneys as I to yow tolde, To goon and usen hem in engendrure; Than sholde men take of chastitee no cure. Crist was a mayde, and shapen as a man, And many a seint, sith that the world bigan, Yet lived they ever in parfit chastitee. I nil envye no virginitee; Lat hem be breed of pured whete-seed, And lat us wyves hoten barly-breed; And yet with barly-breed, Mark telle can, Our lord Iesu refresshed many a man. In swich estaat as god hath cleped us I wol persevere, I nam nat precious. In wyfhode I wol use myn instrument As frely as my maker hath it sent. If I be daungerous, god yeve me sorwe! Myn housbond shal it have bothe eve and morwe, Whan that him list com forth and paye his dette. An housbonde I wol have, I nil nat lette, Which shal be bothe my dettour and my thral, And have his tribulacioun with-al Up-on his flessh, whyl that I am his wyf. I have the power duringe al my lyf Up-on his propre body, and noght he. Right thus the apostel tolde it un-to me; And bad our housbondes for to love us weel. Al this sentence me lyketh every-deel’— Up sterte the Pardoner, and that anon, ‘Now dame,’ quod he, ‘by god and by seint Iohn, Ye been a noble prechour in this cas! I was aboute to wedde a wyf; allas! What sholde I bye it on my flesh so dere? Yet hadde I lever wedde no wyf to-yere!’ ‘Abyde!’ quod she, ‘my tale is nat bigonne; Nay, thou shalt drinken of another tonne Er that I go, shal savoure wors than ale. And whan that I have told thee forth my tale Of tribulacioun in mariage, Of which I am expert in al myn age, This to seyn, my-self have been the whippe;— Than maystow chese whether thou wolt sippe Of thilke tonne that I shal abroche. Be war of it, er thou to ny approche; For I shal telle ensamples mo than ten. Who-so that nil be war by othere men, By him shul othere men corrected be. The same wordes wryteth Ptholomee; Rede in his Almageste, and take it there.’ ‘Dame, I wolde praye yow, if your wil it were,’ Seyde this Pardoner, ‘as ye bigan, Telle forth your tale, spareth for no man, And teche us yonge men of your praktike.’ ‘Gladly,’ quod she, ‘sith it may yow lyke. But yet I praye to al this companye, If that I speke after my fantasye, As taketh not a-grief of that I seye; For myn entente nis but for to pleye. Now sires, now wol I telle forth my tale.— As ever mote I drinken wyn or ale, I shal seye sooth, tho housbondes that I hadde, As three of hem were gode and two were badde. The three men were gode, and riche, and olde; Unnethe mighte they the statut holde In which that they were bounden un-to me. Ye woot wel what I mene of this, pardee! As help me god, I laughe whan I thinke How pitously a-night I made hem swinke; And by my fey, I tolde of it no stoor. They had me yeven hir gold and hir tresoor; Me neded nat do lenger diligence To winne hir love, or doon hem reverence. They loved me so wel, by god above, That I ne tolde no deyntee of hir love! A wys womman wol sette hir ever in oon To gete hir love, ther as she hath noon. But sith I hadde hem hoolly in myn hond, And sith they hadde me yeven all hir lond, What sholde I taken hede hem for to plese, But it were for my profit and myn ese? I sette hem so a-werke, by my fey, That many a night they songen “weilawey!” The bacoun was nat fet for hem, I trowe, That some men han in Essex at Dunmowe. I governed hem so wel, after my lawe, That ech of hem ful blisful was and fawe To bringe me gaye thinges fro the fayre. They were ful glad whan I spak to hem fayre; For god it woot, I chidde hem spitously. Now herkneth, how I bar me proprely, Ye wyse wyves, that can understonde. Thus shul ye speke and bere hem wrong on honde; For half so boldely can ther no man Swere and lyen as a womman can. I sey nat this by wyves that ben wyse, But-if it be whan they hem misavyse. A wys wyf, if that she can hir good, Shal beren him on hond the cow is wood, And take witnesse of hir owene mayde Of hir assent; but herkneth how I sayde. ‘Sir olde kaynard, is this thyn array? Why is my neighebores wyf so gay? She is honoured over-al ther she goth; I sitte at hoom, I have no thrifty cloth. What dostow at my neighebores hous? Is she so fair? artow so amorous? What rowne ye with our mayde? benedicite! Sir olde lechour, lat thy Iapes be! And if I have a gossib or a freend, With-outen gilt, thou chydest as a feend, If that I walke or pleye un-to his hous! Thou comest hoom as dronken as a mous, And prechest on thy bench, with yvel preef! Thou seist to me, it is a greet meschief To wedde a povre womman, for costage; And if that she be riche, of heigh parage, Than seistow that it is a tormentrye To suffre hir pryde and hir malencolye. And if that she be fair, thou verray knave, Thou seyst that every holour wol hir have; She may no whyle in chastitee abyde, That is assailled up-on ech a syde. Thou seyst, som folk desyre us for richesse, Somme for our shap, and somme for our fairnesse; And som, for she can outher singe or daunce, And som, for gentillesse and daliaunce; Som, for hir handes and hir armes smale; Thus goth al to the devel by thy tale. Thou seyst, men may nat kepe a castel-wal; It may so longe assailled been over-al. And if that she be foul, thou seist that she Coveiteth every man that she may se; For as a spaynel she wol on him lepe, Til that she finde som man hir to chepe; Ne noon so grey goos goth ther in the lake, As, seistow, that wol been with-oute make. And seyst, it is an hard thing for to welde A thing that no man wol, his thankes, helde. Thus seistow, lorel, whan thow goost to bedde; And that no wys man nedeth for to wedde, Ne no man that entendeth un-to hevene. With wilde thonder-dint and firy levene Mote thy welked nekke be to-broke! Thow seyst that dropping houses, and eek smoke, And chyding wyves, maken men to flee Out of hir owene hous; a! benedicite! What eyleth swich an old man for to chyde? Thow seyst, we wyves wol our vyces hyde Til we be fast, and than we wol hem shewe; Wel may that be a proverbe of a shrewe! Thou seist, that oxen, asses, hors, and houndes, They been assayed at diverse stoundes; Bacins, lavours, er that men hem bye, Spones and stoles, and al swich housbondrye, And so been pottes, clothes, and array; But folk of wyves maken noon assay Til they be wedded; olde dotard shrewe! And than, seistow, we wol oure vices shewe. Thou seist also, that it displeseth me But-if that thou wolt preyse my beautee, And but thou poure alwey up-on my face, And clepe me “faire dame” in every place; And but thou make a feste on thilke day That I was born, and make me fresh and gay, And but thou do to my norice honour, And to my chamberere with-inne my bour, And to my fadres folk and his allyes;— Thus seistow, olde barel ful of lyes! And yet of our apprentice Ianekyn, For his crisp heer, shyninge as gold so fyn, And for he squiereth me bothe up and doun, Yet hastow caught a fals suspecioun; I wol hym noght, thogh thou were deed to-morwe. But tel me this, why hydestow, with sorwe, The keyes of thy cheste awey fro me? It is my good as wel as thyn, pardee. What wenestow make an idiot of our dame? Now by that lord, that called is seint Iame, Thou shalt nat bothe, thogh that thou were wood, Be maister of my body and of my good; That oon thou shalt forgo, maugree thyne yën; What nedeth thee of me to enquere or spyën? I trowe, thou woldest loke me in thy chiste! Thou sholdest seye, “wyf, go wher thee liste, Tak your disport, I wol nat leve no talis; I knowe yow for a trewe wyf, dame Alis.” We love no man that taketh kepe or charge Wher that we goon, we wol ben at our large. Of alle men y-blessed moot he be, The wyse astrologien Dan Ptholome, That seith this proverbe in his Almageste, “Of alle men his wisdom is the hyeste, That rekketh never who hath the world in honde.” By this proverbe thou shalt understonde, Have thou y-nogh, what thar thee recche or care How merily that othere folkes fare? For certeyn, olde dotard, by your leve, Ye shul have queynte right y-nough at eve. He is to greet a nigard that wol werne A man to lighte his candle at his lanterne; He shal have never the lasse light, pardee; Have thou y-nough, thee thar nat pleyne thee. Thou seyst also, that if we make us gay With clothing and with precious array, That it is peril of our chastitee; And yet, with sorwe, thou most enforce thee, And seye thise wordes in the apostles name, “In habit, maad with chastitee and shame, Ye wommen shul apparaille yow,” quod he, “And noght in tressed heer and gay perree, As perles, ne with gold, ne clothes riche;” After thy text, ne after thy rubriche I wol nat wirche as muchel as a gnat. Thou seydest this, that I was lyk a cat; For who-so wolde senge a cattes skin, Thanne wolde the cat wel dwellen in his in; And if the cattes skin be slyk and gay, She wol nat dwelle in house half a day, But forth she wole, er any day be dawed, To shewe hir skin, and goon a-caterwawed; This is to seye, if I be gay, sir shrewe, I wol renne out, my borel for to shewe. Sire olde fool, what eyleth thee to spyën? Thogh thou preye Argus, with his hundred yën, To be my warde-cors, as he can best, In feith, he shal nat kepe me but me lest; Yet coude I make his berd, so moot I thee. Thou seydest eek, that ther ben thinges three, The whiche thinges troublen al this erthe, And that no wight ne may endure the ferthe; O leve sir shrewe, Iesu shorte thy lyf! Yet prechestow, and seyst, an hateful wyf Y-rekened is for oon of thise meschances. Been ther none othere maner resemblances That ye may lykne your parables to, But-if a sely wyf be oon of tho? Thou lykenest wommanes love to helle, To bareyne lond, ther water may not dwelle. Thou lyknest it also to wilde fyr; The more it brenneth, the more it hath desyr To consume every thing that brent wol be. Thou seyst, that right as wormes shende a tree, Right so a wyf destroyeth hir housbonde; This knowe they that been to wyves bonde.’ Lordinges, right thus, as ye have understonde, Bar I stifly myne olde housbondes on honde, That thus they seyden in hir dronkenesse; And al was fals, but that I took witnesse On Ianekin and on my nece also. O lord, the peyne I dide hem and the wo, Ful giltelees, by goddes swete pyne! For as an hors I coude byte and whyne. I coude pleyne, thogh I were in the gilt, Or elles often tyme hadde I ben spilt. Who-so that first to mille comth, first grint; I pleyned first, so was our werre y-stint. They were ful glad to excusen hem ful blyve Of thing of which they never agilte hir lyve. Of wenches wolde I beren him on honde, Whan that for syk unnethes mighte he stonde. Yet tikled it his herte, for that he Wende that I hadde of him so greet chiertee. I swoor that al my walkinge out by nighte Was for tespye wenches that he dighte; Under that colour hadde I many a mirthe. For al swich wit is yeven us in our birthe; Deceite, weping, spinning god hath yive To wommen kindely, whyl they may live. And thus of o thing I avaunte me, Atte ende I hadde the bettre in ech degree, By sleighte, or force, or by som maner thing, As by continuel murmur or grucching; Namely a-bedde hadden they meschaunce, Ther wolde I chyde and do hem no plesaunce; I wolde no lenger in the bed abyde, If that I felte his arm over my syde, Til he had maad his raunson un-to me; Than wolde I suffre him do his nycetee. And ther-fore every man this tale I telle, Winne who-so may, for al is for to selle. With empty hand men may none haukes lure; For winning wolde I al his lust endure, And make me a feyned appetyt; And yet in bacon hadde I never delyt; That made me that ever I wolde hem chyde. For thogh the pope had seten hem biside, I wolde nat spare hem at hir owene bord. For by my trouthe, I quitte hem word for word. As help me verray god omnipotent, Thogh I right now sholde make my testament, I ne owe hem nat a word that it nis quit. I broghte it so aboute by my wit, That they moste yeve it up, as for the beste; Or elles hadde we never been in reste. For thogh he loked as a wood leoun, Yet sholde he faille of his conclusioun. Thanne wolde I seye, ‘gode lief, tak keep How mekely loketh Wilkin oure sheep; Com neer, my spouse, lat me ba thy cheke! Ye sholde been al pacient and meke, And han a swete spyced conscience, Sith ye so preche of Iobes pacience. Suffreth alwey, sin ye so wel can preche; And but ye do, certein we shal yow teche That it is fair to have a wyf in pees. Oon of us two moste bowen, doutelees; And sith a man is more resonable Than womman is, ye moste been suffrable. What eyleth yow to grucche thus and grone? Is it for ye wolde have my queynte allone? Why taak it al, lo, have it every-deel; Peter! I shrewe yow but ye love it weel! For if I wolde selle my bele chose, I coude walke as fresh as is a rose; But I wol kepe it for your owene tooth. Ye be to blame, by god, I sey yow sooth.’ Swiche maner wordes hadde we on honde. Now wol I speken of my fourthe housbonde. My fourthe housbonde was a revelour, This is to seyn, he hadde a paramour; And I was yong and ful of ragerye, Stiborn and strong, and Ioly as a pye. Wel coude I daunce to an harpe smale, And singe, y-wis, as any nightingale, Whan I had dronke a draughte of swete wyn. Metellius, the foule cherl, the swyn, That with a staf birafte his wyf hir lyf, For she drank wyn, thogh I hadde been his wyf, He sholde nat han daunted me fro drinke; And, after wyn, on Venus moste I thinke: For al so siker as cold engendreth hayl, A likerous mouth moste han a likerous tayl. In womman vinolent is no defence, This knowen lechours by experience. But, lord Crist! whan that it remembreth me Up-on my yowthe, and on my Iolitee, It tikleth me aboute myn herte rote. Unto this day it dooth myn herte bote That I have had my world as in my tyme. But age, allas! that al wol envenyme, Hath me biraft my beautee and my pith; Lat go, fare-wel, the devel go therwith! The flour is goon, ther is na-more to telle, The bren, as I best can, now moste I selle; But yet to be right mery wol I fonde. Now wol I tellen of my fourthe housbonde. I seye, I hadde in herte greet despyt That he of any other had delyt. But he was quit, by god and by seint Ioce! I made him of the same wode a croce; Nat of my body in no foul manere, But certeinly, I made folk swich chere, That in his owene grece I made him frye For angre, and for verray Ialousye. By god, in erthe I was his purgatorie, For which I hope his soule be in glorie. For god it woot, he sat ful ofte and song Whan that his shoo ful bitterly him wrong. Ther was no wight, save god and he, that wiste, In many wyse, how sore I him twiste. He deyde whan I cam fro Ierusalem, And lyth y-grave under the rode-beem, Al is his tombe noght so curious As was the sepulcre of him, Darius, Which that Appelles wroghte subtilly; It nis but wast to burie him preciously. Lat him fare-wel, god yeve his soule reste, He is now in the grave and in his cheste. Now of my fifthe housbond wol I telle. God lete his soule never come in helle! And yet was he to me the moste shrewe; That fele I on my ribbes al by rewe, And ever shal, un-to myn ending-day. But in our bed he was so fresh and gay, And ther-with-al so wel coude he me glose, Whan that he wolde han my bele chose, That thogh he hadde me bet on every boon, He coude winne agayn my love anoon. I trowe I loved him beste, for that he Was of his love daungerous to me. We wommen han, if that I shal nat lye, In this matere a queynte fantasye; Wayte what thing we may nat lightly have, Ther-after wol we crye al-day and crave. Forbede us thing, and that desyren we; Prees on us faste, and thanne wol we flee. With daunger oute we al our chaffare; Greet prees at market maketh dere ware, And to greet cheep is holde at litel prys; This knoweth every womman that is wys. My fifthe housbonde, god his soule blesse! Which that I took for love and no richesse, He som-tyme was a clerk of Oxenford, And had left scole, and wente at hoom to bord With my gossib, dwellinge in oure toun, God have hir soule! hir name was Alisoun. She knew myn herte and eek my privetee Bet than our parisshe-preest, so moot I thee! To hir biwreyed I my conseil al. For had myn housbonde pissed on a wal, Or doon a thing that sholde han cost his lyf, To hir, and to another worthy wyf, And to my nece, which that I loved weel, I wolde han told his conseil every-deel. And so I dide ful often, god it woot, That made his face ful often reed and hoot For verray shame, and blamed him-self for he Had told to me so greet a privetee. And so bifel that ones, in a Lente, (So often tymes I to my gossib wente, For ever yet I lovede to be gay, And for to walke, in March, Averille, and May, Fro hous to hous, to here sondry talis), That Iankin clerk, and my gossib dame Alis, And I my-self, in-to the feldes wente. Myn housbond was at London al that Lente; I hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye, And for to see, and eek for to be seye Of lusty folk; what wiste I wher my grace Was shapen for to be, or in what place? Therefore I made my visitaciouns, To vigilies and to processiouns, To preching eek and to thise pilgrimages, To pleyes of miracles and mariages, And wered upon my gaye scarlet gytes. Thise wormes, ne thise motthes, ne thise mytes, Upon my peril, frete hem never a deel; And wostow why? for they were used weel. Now wol I tellen forth what happed me. I seye, that in the feeldes walked we, Til trewely we hadde swich daliance, This clerk and I, that of my purveyance I spak to him, and seyde him, how that he, If I were widwe, sholde wedde me. For certeinly, I sey for no bobance, Yet was I never with-outen purveyance Of mariage, nof othere thinges eek. I holde a mouses herte nat worth a leek, That hath but oon hole for to sterte to, And if that faille, thanne is al y-do. I bar him on honde, he hadde enchanted me; My dame taughte me that soutiltee. And eek I seyde, I mette of him al night; He wolde han slayn me as I lay up-right, And al my bed was ful of verray blood, But yet I hope that he shal do me good; For blood bitokeneth gold, as me was taught. And al was fals, I dremed of it right naught, But as I folwed ay my dames lore, As wel of this as of other thinges more. But now sir, lat me see, what I shal seyn? A! ha! by god, I have my tale ageyn. Whan that my fourthe housbond was on bere, I weep algate, and made sory chere, As wyves moten, for it is usage, And with my coverchief covered my visage; But for that I was purveyed of a make, I weep but smal, and that I undertake. To chirche was myn housbond born a-morwe With neighebores, that for him maden sorwe; And Iankin oure clerk was oon of tho. As help me god, whan that I saugh him go After the bere, me thoughte he hadde a paire Of legges and of feet so clene and faire, That al myn herte I yaf un-to his hold. He was, I trowe, a twenty winter old, And I was fourty, if I shal seye sooth; But yet I hadde alwey a coltes tooth. Gat-tothed I was, and that bicam me weel; I hadde the prente of sëynt Venus seel. As help me god, I was a lusty oon, And faire and riche, and yong, and wel bigoon; And trewely, as myne housbondes tolde me, I had the beste quoniam mighte be. For certes, I am al Venerien In felinge, and myn herte is Marcien. Venus me yaf my lust, my likerousnesse, And Mars yaf me my sturdy hardinesse. Myn ascendent was Taur, and Mars ther-inne. Allas! allas! that ever love was sinne! I folwed ay myn inclinacioun By vertu of my constellacioun; That made me I coude noght withdrawe My chambre of Venus from a good felawe. Yet have I Martes mark up-on my face, And also in another privee place. For, god so wis be my savacioun, I ne loved never by no discrecioun, But ever folwede myn appetyt, Al were he short or long, or blak or whyt; I took no kepe, so that he lyked me, How pore he was, ne eek of what degree. What sholde I seye, but, at the monthes ende, This Ioly clerk Iankin, that was so hende, Hath wedded me with greet solempnitee, And to him yaf I al the lond and fee That ever was me yeven ther-bifore; But afterward repented me ful sore. He nolde suffre nothing of my list. By god, he smoot me ones on the list, For that I rente out of his book a leef, That of the strook myn ere wex al deef. Stiborn I was as is a leonesse, And of my tonge a verray Iangleresse, And walke I wolde, as I had doon biforn, From hous to hous, al-though he had it sworn. For which he often tymes wolde preche, And me of olde Romayn gestes teche, How he, Simplicius Gallus, lefte his wyf, And hir forsook for terme of al his lyf, Noght but for open-heeded he hir say Lokinge out at his dore upon a day. Another Romayn tolde he me by name, That, for his wyf was at a someres game With-oute his witing, he forsook hir eke. And than wolde he up-on his Bible seke That ilke proverbe of Ecclesiaste, Wher he comandeth and forbedeth faste, Man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute; Than wolde he seye right thus, with-outen doute, “Who-so that buildeth his hous al of salwes, And priketh his blinde hors over the falwes, And suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes, Is worthy to been hanged on the galwes!” But al for noght, I sette noght an hawe Of his proverbes nof his olde sawe, Ne I wolde nat of him corrected be. I hate him that my vices telleth me, And so do mo, god woot! of us than I. This made him with me wood al outrely; I nolde noght forbere him in no cas. Now wol I seye yow sooth, by seint Thomas, Why that I rente out of his book a leef, For which he smoot me so that I was deef. He hadde a book that gladly, night and day, For his desport he wolde rede alway. He cleped it Valerie and Theofraste, At whiche book he lough alwey ful faste. And eek ther was som-tyme a clerk at Rome, A cardinal, that highte Seint Ierome, That made a book agayn Iovinian; In whiche book eek ther was Tertulan, Crisippus, Trotula, and Helowys, That was abbesse nat fer fro Parys; And eek the Parables of Salomon, Ovydes Art, and bokes many on, And alle thise wer bounden in o volume. And every night and day was his custume, Whan he had leyser and vacacioun From other worldly occupacioun, To reden on this book of wikked wyves. He knew of hem mo legendes and lyves Than been of gode wyves in the Bible. For trusteth wel, it is an impossible That any clerk wol speke good of wyves, But-if it be of holy seintes lyves, Ne of noon other womman never the mo. Who peyntede the leoun, tel me who? By god, if wommen hadde writen stories, As clerkes han with-inne hir oratories, They wolde han writen of men more wikkednesse Than all the mark of Adam may redresse. The children of Mercurie and of Venus Been in hir wirking ful contrarious; Mercurie loveth wisdom and science, And Venus loveth ryot and dispence. And, for hir diverse disposicioun, Ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun; And thus, god woot! Mercurie is desolat In Pisces, wher Venus is exaltat; And Venus falleth ther Mercurie is reysed; Therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed. The clerk, whan he is old, and may noght do Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho, Than sit he doun, and writ in his dotage That wommen can nat kepe hir mariage! But now to purpos, why I tolde thee That I was beten for a book, pardee. Up-on a night Iankin, that was our syre, Redde on his book, as he sat by the fyre, Of Eva first, that, for hir wikkednesse, Was al mankinde broght to wrecchednesse, For which that Iesu Crist him-self was slayn, That boghte us with his herte-blood agayn. Lo, here expres of womman may ye finde, That womman was the los of al mankinde. Tho redde he me how Sampson loste his heres, Slepinge, his lemman kitte hem with hir sheres; Thurgh whiche tresoun loste he bothe his yën. Tho redde he me, if that I shal nat lyen, Of Hercules and of his Dianyre, That caused him to sette himself a-fyre. No-thing forgat he the penaunce and wo That Socrates had with hise wyves two; How Xantippa caste pisse up-on his heed; This sely man sat stille, as he were deed; He wyped his heed, namore dorste he seyn But “er that thonder stinte, comth a reyn.” Of Phasipha, that was the quene of Crete, For shrewednesse, him thoughte the tale swete; Fy! spek na-more—it is a grisly thing— Of hir horrible lust and hir lyking. Of Clitemistra, for hir lecherye, That falsly made hir housbond for to dye, He redde it with ful good devocioun. He tolde me eek for what occasioun Amphiorax at Thebes loste his lyf; Myn housbond hadde a legende of his wyf, Eriphilem, that for an ouche of gold Hath prively un-to the Grekes told Wher that hir housbonde hidde him in a place, For which he hadde at Thebes sory grace. Of Lyma tolde he me, and of Lucye, They bothe made hir housbondes for to dye; That oon for love, that other was for hate; Lyma hir housbond, on an even late, Empoysoned hath, for that she was his fo. Lucya, likerous, loved hir housbond so, That, for he sholde alwey up-on hir thinke, She yaf him swich a maner love-drinke, That he was deed, er it were by the morwe; And thus algates housbondes han sorwe. Than tolde he me, how oon Latumius Compleyned to his felawe Arrius, That in his gardin growed swich a tree, On which, he seyde, how that his wyves three Hanged hem-self for herte despitous. “O leve brother,” quod this Arrius, “Yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree, And in my gardin planted shal it be!” Of latter date, of wyves hath he red, That somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed, And lete hir lechour dighte hir al the night Whyl that the corps lay in the floor up-right. And somme han drive nayles in hir brayn Whyl that they slepte, and thus they han hem slayn. Somme han hem yeve poysoun in hir drinke. He spak more harm than herte may bithinke. And ther-with-al, he knew of mo proverbes Than in this world ther growen gras or herbes. “Bet is,” quod he, “thyn habitacioun Be with a leoun or a foul dragoun, Than with a womman usinge for to chyde. Bet is,” quod he, “hye in the roof abyde Than with an angry wyf doun in the hous; They been so wikked and contrarious; They haten that hir housbondes loveth ay.” He seyde, “a womman cast hir shame away, Whan she cast of hir smok;” and forther-mo, “A fair womman, but she be chaast also, Is lyk a gold ring in a sowes nose.” Who wolde wenen, or who wolde suppose The wo that in myn herte was, and pyne? And whan I saugh he wolde never fyne To reden on this cursed book al night, Al sodeynly three leves have I plight Out of his book, right as he radde, and eke, I with my fist so took him on the cheke, That in our fyr he fil bakward adoun. And he up-stirte as dooth a wood leoun, And with his fist he smoot me on the heed, That in the floor I lay as I were deed. And when he saugh how stille that I lay, He was agast, and wolde han fled his way, Til atte laste out of my swogh I breyde: “O! hastow slayn me, false theef?” I seyde, “And for my land thus hastow mordred me? Er I be deed, yet wol I kisse thee.” And neer he cam, and kneled faire adoun, And seyde, “dere suster Alisoun, As help me god, I shal thee never smyte; That I have doon, it is thy-self to wyte. Foryeve it me, and that I thee biseke”— And yet eft-sones I hitte him on the cheke, And seyde, “theef, thus muchel am I wreke; Now wol I dye, I may no lenger speke.” But atte laste, with muchel care and wo, We fille acorded, by us selven two. He yaf me al the brydel in myn hond To han the governance of hous and lond, And of his tonge and of his hond also, And made him brenne his book anon right tho. And whan that I hadde geten un-to me, By maistrie, al the soveraynetee, And that he seyde, “myn owene trewe wyf, Do as thee lust the terme of al thy lyf, Keep thyn honour, and keep eek myn estaat”— After that day we hadden never debaat. God help me so, I was to him as kinde As any wyf from Denmark un-to Inde, And also trewe, and so was he to me. I prey to god that sit in magestee, So blesse his soule, for his mercy dere! Now wol I seye my tale, if ye wol here.’ Biholde the wordes bitween the Somonour and the Frere. The Frere lough, whan he hadde herd al this, ‘Now, dame,’ quod he, ‘so have I Ioye or blis, This is a long preamble of a tale!’ And whan the Somnour herde the Frere gale, ‘Lo!’ quod the Somnour, ‘goddes armes two! A frere wol entremette him ever-mo. Lo, gode men, a flye and eek a frere Wol falle in every dish and eek matere. What spekestow of preambulacioun? What! amble, or trotte, or pees, or go sit doun; Thou lettest our disport in this manere.’ ‘Ye, woltow so, sir Somnour?’ quod the Frere, ‘Now, by my feith, I shal, er that I go, Telle of a Somnour swich a tale or two, That alle the folk shal laughen in this place.’ ‘Now elles, Frere, I bishrewe thy face,’ Quod this Somnour, ‘and I bishrewe me, But-if I telle tales two or thre Of freres er I come to Sidingborne, That I shal make thyn herte for to morne; For wel I woot thy pacience is goon.’ Our hoste cryde ‘pees! and that anoon!’ And seyde, ‘lat the womman telle hir tale. Ye fare as folk that dronken been of ale. Do, dame, tel forth your tale, and that is best.’ ‘Al redy, sir,’ quod she, ‘right as yow lest, If I have licence of this worthy Frere.’ ‘Yis, dame,’ quod he, ‘tel forth, and I wol here.’ Here endeth the Wyf of Bathe hir Prologe. THE TALE OF THE WYF OF BATHE. Here biginneth the Tale of the Wyf of Bathe. In tholde dayes of the king Arthour, Of which that Britons speken greet honour, Al was this land fulfild of fayerye. The elf-queen, with hir Ioly companye, Daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede; This was the olde opinion, as I rede. I speke of manye hundred yeres ago; But now can no man see none elves mo. For now the grete charitee and prayeres Of limitours and othere holy freres, That serchen every lond and every streem, As thikke as motes in the sonne-beem, Blessinge halles, chambres, kichenes, boures, Citees, burghes, castels, hye toures, Thropes, bernes, shipnes, dayeryes, This maketh that ther been no fayeryes. For ther as wont to walken was an elf, Ther walketh now the limitour him-self In undermeles and in morweninges, And seyth his matins and his holy thinges As he goth in his limitacioun. Wommen may go saufly up and doun, In every bush, or under every tree; Ther is noon other incubus but he, And he ne wol doon hem but dishonour. And so bifel it, that this king Arthour Hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler, That on a day cam rydinge fro river; And happed that, allone as she was born, He saugh a mayde walkinge him biforn, Of whiche mayde anon, maugree hir heed, By verray force he rafte hir maydenheed; For which oppressioun was swich clamour And swich pursute un-to the king Arthour, That dampned was this knight for to be deed By cours of lawe, and sholde han lost his heed Paraventure, swich was the statut tho; But that the quene and othere ladies mo So longe preyeden the king of grace, Til he his lyf him graunted in the place, And yaf him to the quene al at hir wille, To chese, whether she wolde him save or spille. The quene thanketh the king with al hir might, And after this thus spak she to the knight, Whan that she saugh hir tyme, up-on a day: ‘Thou standest yet,’ quod she, ‘in swich array, That of thy lyf yet hastow no suretee. I grante thee lyf, if thou canst tellen me What thing is it that wommen most desyren? Be war, and keep thy nekke-boon from yren. And if thou canst nat tellen it anon, Yet wol I yeve thee leve for to gon A twelf-month and a day, to seche and lere An answere suffisant in this matere. And suretee wol I han, er that thou pace, Thy body for to yelden in this place.’ Wo was this knight and sorwefully he syketh; But what! he may nat do al as him lyketh. And at the laste, he chees him for to wende, And come agayn, right at the yeres ende, With swich answere as god wolde him purveye; And taketh his leve, and wendeth forth his weye. He seketh every hous and every place, Wher-as he hopeth for to finde grace, To lerne, what thing wommen loven most; But he ne coude arryven in no cost, Wher-as he mighte finde in this matere Two creatures accordinge in-fere. Somme seyde, wommen loven best richesse, Somme seyde, honour, somme seyde, Iolynesse; Somme, riche array, somme seyden, lust abedde, And ofte tyme to be widwe and wedde. Somme seyde, that our hertes been most esed, Whan that we been y-flatered and y-plesed. He gooth ful ny the sothe, I wol nat lye; A man shal winne us best with flaterye; And with attendance, and with bisinesse, Been we y-lymed, bothe more and lesse. And somme seyn, how that we loven best For to be free, and do right as us lest, And that no man repreve us of our vyce, But seye that we be wyse, and no-thing nyce. For trewely, ther is noon of us alle, If any wight wol clawe us on the galle, That we nil kike, for he seith us sooth; Assay, and he shal finde it that so dooth. For be we never so vicious with-inne, We wol been holden wyse, and clene of sinne. And somme seyn, that greet delyt han we For to ben holden stable and eek secree, And in o purpos stedefastly to dwelle, And nat biwreye thing that men us telle. But that tale is nat worth a rake-stele; Pardee, we wommen conne no-thing hele; Witnesse on Myda; wol ye here the tale? Ovyde, amonges othere thinges smale, Seyde, Myda hadde, under his longe heres, Growinge up-on his heed two asses eres, The which vyce he hidde, as he best mighte, Ful subtilly from every mannes sighte, That, save his wyf, ther wiste of it na-mo. He loved hir most, and trusted hir also; He preyede hir, that to no creature She sholde tellen of his disfigure. She swoor him ‘nay, for al this world to winne, She nolde do that vileinye or sinne, To make hir housbond han so foul a name; She nolde nat telle it for hir owene shame.’ But nathelees, hir thoughte that she dyde, That she so longe sholde a conseil hyde; Hir thoughte it swal so sore aboute hir herte, That nedely som word hir moste asterte; And sith she dorste telle it to no man, Doun to a mareys faste by she ran; Til she came there, hir herte was a-fyre, And, as a bitore bombleth in the myre, She leyde hir mouth un-to the water doun: ‘Biwreye me nat, thou water, with thy soun,’ Quod she, ‘to thee I telle it, and namo; Myn housbond hath longe asses eres two! Now is myn herte all hool, now is it oute; I mighte no lenger kepe it, out of doute.’ Heer may ye se, thogh we a tyme abyde, Yet out it moot, we can no conseil hyde; The remenant of the tale if ye wol here, Redeth Ovyde, and ther ye may it lere. This knight, of which my tale is specially, Whan that he saugh he mighte nat come therby, This is to seye, what wommen loven moost, With-inne his brest ful sorweful was the goost; But hoom he gooth, he mighte nat soiourne. The day was come, that hoomward moste he tourne, And in his wey it happed him to ryde, In al this care, under a forest-syde, Wher-as he saugh up-on a daunce go Of ladies foure and twenty, and yet mo; Toward the whiche daunce he drow ful yerne, In hope that som wisdom sholde he lerne. But certeinly, er he came fully there, Vanisshed was this daunce, he niste where. No creature saugh he that bar lyf, Save on the grene he saugh sittinge a wyf; A fouler wight ther may no man devyse. Agayn the knight this olde wyf gan ryse, And seyde, ‘sir knight, heer-forth ne lyth no wey. Tel me, what that ye seken, by your fey? Paraventure it may the bettre be; Thise olde folk can muchel thing,’ quod she. ‘My leve mooder,’ quod this knight certeyn, ‘I nam but deed, but-if that I can seyn What thing it is that wommen most desyre; Coude ye me wisse, I wolde wel quyte your hyre.’ ‘Plighte me thy trouthe, heer in myn hand,’ quod she, ‘The nexte thing that I requere thee, Thou shalt it do, if it lye in thy might; And I wol telle it yow er it be night.’ ‘Have heer my trouthe,’ quod the knight, ‘I grante.’ ‘Thanne,’ quod she, ‘I dar me wel avante, Thy lyf is sauf, for I wol stonde therby, Up-on my lyf, the queen wol seye as I. Lat see which is the proudeste of hem alle, That wereth on a coverchief or a calle, That dar seye nay, of that I shal thee teche; Lat us go forth with-outen lenger speche.’ Tho rouned she a pistel in his ere, And bad him to be glad, and have no fere. Whan they be comen to the court, this knight Seyde, ‘he had holde his day, as he hadde hight, And redy was his answere,’ as he sayde. Ful many a noble wyf, and many a mayde, And many a widwe, for that they ben wyse, The quene hir-self sittinge as a Iustyse, Assembled been, his answere for to here; And afterward this knight was bode appere. To every wight comanded was silence, And that the knight sholde telle in audience, What thing that worldly wommen loven best. This knight ne stood nat stille as doth a best, But to his questioun anon answerde With manly voys, that al the court it herde: ‘My lige lady, generally,’ quod he, ‘Wommen desyren to have sovereyntee As wel over hir housbond as hir love, And for to been in maistrie him above; This is your moste desyr, thogh ye me kille, Doth as yow list, I am heer at your wille.’ In al the court ne was ther wyf ne mayde, Ne widwe, that contraried that he sayde, But seyden, ‘he was worthy han his lyf.’ And with that word up stirte the olde wyf, Which that the knight saugh sittinge in the grene: ‘Mercy,’ quod she, ‘my sovereyn lady quene! Er that your court departe, do me right. I taughte this answere un-to the knight; For which he plighte me his trouthe there, The firste thing I wolde of him requere, He wolde it do, if it lay in his might. Bifore the court than preye I thee, sir knight,’ Quod she, ‘that thou me take un-to thy wyf; For wel thou wost that I have kept thy lyf. If I sey fals, sey nay, up-on thy fey!’ This knight answerde, ‘allas! and weylawey! I woot right wel that swich was my biheste. For goddes love, as chees a newe requeste; Tak al my good, and lat my body go.’ ‘Nay than,’ quod she, ‘I shrewe us bothe two! For thogh that I be foul, and old, and pore, I nolde for al the metal, ne for ore, That under erthe is grave, or lyth above, But-if thy wyf I were, and eek thy love.’ ‘My love?’ quod he; ‘nay, my dampnacioun! Allas! that any of my nacioun Sholde ever so foule disparaged be!’ But al for noght, the ende is this, that he Constreyned was, he nedes moste hir wedde; And taketh his olde wyf, and gooth to bedde. Now wolden som men seye, paraventure, That, for my necligence, I do no cure To tellen yow the Ioye and al tharray That at the feste was that ilke day. To whiche thing shortly answere I shal; I seye, ther nas no Ioye ne feste at al, Ther nas but hevinesse and muche sorwe; For prively he wedded hir on a morwe, And al day after hidde him as an oule; So wo was him, his wyf looked so foule. Greet was the wo the knight hadde in his thoght, Whan he was with his wyf a-bedde y-broght; He walweth, and he turneth to and fro. His olde wyf lay smylinge evermo, And seyde, ‘o dere housbond, benedicite! Fareth every knight thus with his wyf as ye? Is this the lawe of king Arthures hous? Is every knight of his so dangerous? I am your owene love and eek your wyf; I am she, which that saved hath your lyf; And certes, yet dide I yow never unright; Why fare ye thus with me this firste night? Ye faren lyk a man had lost his wit; What is my gilt? for goddes love, tel me it, And it shal been amended, if I may.’ ‘Amended?’ quod this knight, ‘allas! nay, nay! It wol nat been amended never mo! Thou art so loothly, and so old also, And ther-to comen of so lowe a kinde, That litel wonder is, thogh I walwe and winde. So wolde god myn herte wolde breste!’ ‘Is this,’ quod she, ‘the cause of your unreste?’ ‘Ye, certainly,’ quod he, ‘no wonder is.’ ‘Now, sire,’ quod she, ‘I coude amende al this, If that me liste, er it were dayes three, So wel ye mighte bere yow un-to me. But for ye speken of swich gentillesse As is descended out of old richesse, That therfore sholden ye be gentil men, Swich arrogance is nat worth an hen. Loke who that is most vertuous alway, Privee and apert, and most entendeth ay To do the gentil dedes that he can, And tak him for the grettest gentil man. Crist wol, we clayme of him our gentillesse, Nat of our eldres for hir old richesse. For thogh they yeve us al hir heritage, For which we clayme to been of heigh parage, Yet may they nat biquethe, for no-thing, To noon of us hir vertuous living, That made hem gentil men y-called be; And bad us folwen hem in swich degree. Wel can the wyse poete of Florence, That highte Dant, speken in this sentence; Lo in swich maner rym is Dantes tale: “Ful selde up ryseth by his branches smale Prowesse of man, for god, of his goodnesse, Wol that of him we clayme our gentillesse;” For of our eldres may we no-thing clayme But temporel thing, that man may hurte and mayme. Eek every wight wot this as wel as I, If gentillesse were planted naturelly Un-to a certeyn linage, doun the lyne, Privee ne apert, than wolde they never fyne To doon of gentillesse the faire offyce; They mighte do no vileinye or vyce. Tak fyr, and ber it in the derkeste hous Bitwix this and the mount of Caucasus, And lat men shette the dores and go thenne; Yet wol the fyr as faire lye and brenne, As twenty thousand men mighte it biholde; His office naturel ay wol it holde, Up peril of my lyf, til that it dye. Heer may ye see wel, how that genterye Is nat annexed to possessioun, Sith folk ne doon hir operacioun Alwey, as dooth the fyr, lo! in his kinde. For, god it woot, men may wel often finde A lordes sone do shame and vileinye; And he that wol han prys of his gentrye For he was boren of a gentil hous, And hadde hise eldres noble and vertuous, And nil him-selven do no gentil dedis, Ne folwe his gentil auncestre that deed is, He nis nat gentil, be he duk or erl; For vileyns sinful dedes make a cherl. For gentillesse nis but renomee Of thyne auncestres, for hir heigh bountee, Which is a strange thing to thy persone. Thy gentillesse cometh fro god allone; Than comth our verray gentillesse of grace, It was no-thing biquethe us with our place. Thenketh how noble, as seith Valerius, Was thilke Tullius Hostilius, That out of povert roos to heigh noblesse. Redeth Senek, and redeth eek Boëce, Ther shul ye seen expres that it no drede is, That he is gentil that doth gentil dedis; And therfore, leve housbond, I thus conclude, Al were it that myne auncestres were rude, Yet may the hye god, and so hope I, Grante me grace to liven vertuously. Thanne am I gentil, whan that I biginne To liven vertuously and weyve sinne. And ther-as ye of povert me repreve, The hye god, on whom that we bileve, In wilful povert chees to live his lyf. And certes every man, mayden, or wyf, May understonde that Iesus, hevene king, Ne wolde nat chese a vicious living. Glad povert is an honest thing, certeyn; This wol Senek and othere clerkes seyn. Who-so that halt him payd of his poverte, I holde him riche, al hadde he nat sherte. He that coveyteth is a povre wight, For he wolde han that is nat in his might. But he that noght hath, ne coveyteth have, Is riche, al-though ye holde him but a knave. Verray povert, it singeth proprely; Iuvenal seith of povert merily: “The povre man, whan he goth by the weye, Bifore the theves he may singe and pleye.” Povert is hateful good, and, as I gesse, A ful greet bringer out of bisinesse; A greet amender eek of sapience To him that taketh it in pacience. Povert is this, al-though it seme elenge: Possessioun, that no wight wol chalenge. Povert ful ofte, whan a man is lowe, Maketh his god and eek him-self to knowe. Povert a spectacle is, as thinketh me, Thurgh which he may his verray frendes see. And therfore, sire, sin that I noght yow greve, Of my povert na-more ye me repreve. Now, sire, of elde ye repreve me; And certes, sire, thogh noon auctoritee Were in no book, ye gentils of honour Seyn that men sholde an old wight doon favour, And clepe him fader, for your gentillesse; And auctours shal I finden, as I gesse. Now ther ye seye, that I am foul and old, Than drede you noght to been a cokewold; For filthe and elde, al-so moot I thee, Been grete wardeyns up-on chastitee. But nathelees, sin I knowe your delyt, I shal fulfille your worldly appetyt. Chees now,’ quod she, ‘oon of thise thinges tweye, To han me foul and old til that I deye, And be to yow a trewe humble wyf, And never yow displese in al my lyf, Or elles ye wol han me yong and fair, And take your aventure of the repair That shal be to your hous, by-cause of me, Or in som other place, may wel be. Now chees your-selven, whether that yow lyketh.’ This knight avyseth him and sore syketh, But atte laste he seyde in this manere, ‘My lady and my love, and wyf so dere, I put me in your wyse governance; Cheseth your-self, which may be most plesance, And most honour to yow and me also. I do no fors the whether of the two; For as yow lyketh, it suffiseth me.’ ‘Thanne have I gete of yow maistrye,’ quod she, ‘Sin I may chese, and governe as me lest?’ ‘Ye, certes, wyf,’ quod he, ‘I holde it best.’ ‘Kis me,’ quod she, ‘we be no lenger wrothe; For, by my trouthe, I wol be to yow bothe, This is to seyn, ye, bothe fair and good. I prey to god that I mot sterven wood, But I to yow be al-so good and trewe As ever was wyf, sin that the world was newe. And, but I be to-morn as fair to sene As any lady, emperyce, or quene, That is bitwixe the est and eke the west, Doth with my lyf and deeth right as yow lest. Cast up the curtin, loke how that it is.’ And whan the knight saugh verraily al this, That she so fair was, and so yong ther-to, For Ioye he hente hir in his armes two, His herte bathed in a bath of blisse; A thousand tyme a-rewe he gan hir kisse. And she obeyed him in every thing That mighte doon him plesance or lyking. And thus they live, un-to hir lyves ende, In parfit Ioye; and Iesu Crist us sende Housbondes meke, yonge, and fresshe a-bedde, And grace toverbyde hem that we wedde. And eek I preye Iesu shorte hir lyves That wol nat be governed by hir wyves; And olde and angry nigardes of dispence, God sende hem sone verray pestilence. Here endeth the Wyves Tale of Bathe. THE FRIAR'S PROLOGUE. The Prologe of the Freres tale. This worthy limitour, this noble Frere, He made alwey a maner louring chere Upon the Somnour, but for honestee No vileyns word as yet to him spak he. But atte laste he seyde un-to the Wyf, ‘Dame,’ quod he, ‘god yeve yow right good lyf! Ye han heer touched, al-so moot I thee, In scole-matere greet difficultee; Ye han seyd muchel thing right wel, I seye; But dame, here as we ryden by the weye, Us nedeth nat to speken but of game, And lete auctoritees, on goddes name, To preching and to scole eek of clergye. But if it lyke to this companye, I wol yow of a somnour telle a game. Pardee, ye may wel knowe by the name, That of a somnour may no good be sayd; I praye that noon of you be yvel apayd. A somnour is a renner up and doun With mandements for fornicacioun, And is y-bet at every tounes ende.’ Our host tho spak, ‘a! sire, ye sholde be hende And curteys, as a man of your estaat; In companye we wol have no debaat. Telleth your tale, and lat the Somnour be.’ ‘Nay,’ quod the Somnour, ‘lat him seye to me What so him list; whan it comth to my lot, By god, I shal him quyten every grot. I shal him tellen which a greet honour It is to be a flateringe limitour; And his offyce I shal him telle, y-wis.’ Our host answerde, ‘pees, na-more of this.’ And after this he seyde un-to the Frere, ‘Tel forth your tale, leve maister deere.’ Here endeth the Prologe of the Frere. THE FRERES TALE. Here biginneth the Freres tale. Whilom ther was dwellinge in my contree An erchedeken, a man of heigh degree, That boldely dide execucioun In punisshinge of fornicacioun, Of wicchecraft, and eek of bauderye, Of diffamacioun, and avoutrye, Of chirche-reves, and of testaments, Of contractes, and of lakke of sacraments, And eek of many another maner cryme Which nedeth nat rehercen at this tyme; Of usure, and of symonye also. But certes, lechours dide he grettest wo; They sholde singen, if that they were hent; And smale tytheres weren foule y-shent. If any persone wolde up-on hem pleyne, Their mighte asterte him no pecunial peyne. For smale tythes and for smal offringe, He made the peple pitously to singe. For er the bisshop caughte hem with his hook, They weren in the erchedeknes book. Thanne hadde he, thurgh his Iurisdiccioun, Power to doon on hem correccioun. He hadde a Somnour redy to his hond, A slyer boy was noon in Engelond; For subtilly he hadde his espiaille, That taughte him, wher that him mighte availle. He coude spare of lechours oon or two, To techen him to foure and twenty mo. For thogh this Somnour wood were as an hare, To telle his harlotrye I wol nat spare; For we been out of his correccioun; They han of us no Iurisdiccioun, Ne never shullen, terme of alle hir lyves. ‘Peter! so been the wommen of the styves,’ Quod the Somnour, ‘y-put out of my cure!’ ‘Pees, with mischance and with misaventure,’ Thus seyde our host, ‘and lat him telle his tale. Now telleth forth, thogh that the Somnour gale, Ne spareth nat, myn owene maister dere.’ This false theef, this Somnour, quod the Frere, Hadde alwey baudes redy to his hond, As any hauk to lure in Engelond, That tolde him al the secree that they knewe; For hir acqueyntance was nat come of-newe. They weren hise approwours prively; He took him-self a greet profit therby; His maister knew nat alwey what he wan. With-outen mandement, a lewed man He coude somne, on peyne of Cristes curs, And they were gladde for to fille his purs, And make him grete festes atte nale. And right as Iudas hadde purses smale, And was a theef, right swich a theef was he; His maister hadde but half his duëtee. He was, if I shal yeven him his laude, A theef, and eek a Somnour, and a baude. He hadde eek wenches at his retenue, That, whether that sir Robert or sir Huwe, Or Iakke, or Rauf, or who-so that it were, That lay by hem, they tolde it in his ere; Thus was the wenche and he of oon assent. And he wolde fecche a feyned mandement, And somne hem to the chapitre bothe two, And pile the man, and lete the wenche go. Thanne wolde he seye, ‘frend, I shal for thy sake Do stryken hir out of our lettres blake; Thee thar na-more as in this cas travaille; I am thy freend, ther I thee may availle.’ Certeyn he knew of bryberyes mo Than possible is to telle in yeres two. For in this world nis dogge for the bowe, That can an hurt deer from an hool y-knowe, Bet than this Somnour knew a sly lechour, Or an avouter, or a paramour. And, for that was the fruit of al his rente, Therfore on it he sette al his entente. And so bifel, that ones on a day This Somnour, ever waiting on his pray, Rood for to somne a widwe, an old ribybe, Feynynge a cause, for he wolde brybe. And happed that he saugh bifore him ryde A gay yeman, under a forest-syde. A bowe he bar, and arwes brighte and kene; He hadde up-on a courtepy of grene; And hat up-on his heed with frenges blake. ‘Sir,’ quod this Somnour, ‘hayl! and wel a-take!’ ‘Wel-come,’ quod he, ‘and every good felawe! Wher rydestow under this grene shawe?’ Seyde this yeman, ‘wiltow fer to day?’ This Somnour him answerde, and seyde, ‘nay; Heer faste by,’ quod he, ‘is myn entente To ryden, for to reysen up a rente That longeth to my lordes duëtee. ‘Artow thanne a bailly?’ ‘Ye!’ quod he. He dorste nat, for verray filthe and shame, Seye that he was a somnour, for the name. ‘Depardieux,’ quod this yeman, ‘dere brother, Thou art a bailly, and I am another. I am unknowen as in this contree; Of thyn aqueyntance I wolde praye thee, And eek of brotherhede, if that yow leste. I have gold and silver in my cheste; If that thee happe to comen in our shyre, Al shal be thyn, right as thou wolt desyre.’ ‘Grantmercy,’ quod this Somnour, ‘by my feith!’ Everich in otheres hand his trouthe leith, For to be sworne bretheren til they deye. In daliance they ryden forth hir weye. This Somnour, which that was as ful of Iangles, As ful of venim been thise wariangles, And ever enquering up-on every thing, ‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘where is now your dwelling, Another day if that I sholde yow seche?’ This yeman him answerde in softe speche, ‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘fer in the north contree, Wher, as I hope, som-tyme I shal thee see. Er we departe, I shal thee so wel wisse, That of myn house ne shaltow never misse.’ ‘Now, brother,’ quod this Somnour, ‘I yow preye, Teche me, whyl that we ryden by the weye, Sin that ye been a baillif as am I, Som subtiltee, and tel me feithfully In myn offyce how I may most winne; And spareth nat for conscience ne sinne, But as my brother tel me, how do ye?’ ‘Now, by my trouthe, brother dere,’ seyde he, ‘As I shal tellen thee a feithful tale, My wages been ful streite and ful smale. My lord is hard to me and daungerous, And myn offyce is ful laborous; And therfore by extorcions I live. For sothe, I take al that men wol me yive; Algate, by sleyghte or by violence, Fro yeer to yeer I winne al my dispence. I can no bettre telle feithfully.’ ‘Now, certes,’ quod this Somnour, ‘so fare I; I spare nat to taken, god it woot, But-if it be to hevy or to hoot. What I may gete in conseil prively, No maner conscience of that have I; Nere myn extorcioun, I mighte nat liven, Ne of swiche Iapes wol I nat be shriven. Stomak ne conscience ne knowe I noon; I shrewe thise shrifte-fadres everichoon. Wel be we met, by god and by seint Iame! But, leve brother, tel me than thy name,’ Quod this Somnour; and in this mene-whyle, This yeman gan a litel for to smyle. ‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘wiltow that I thee telle? I am a feend, my dwelling is in helle. And here I ryde about my purchasing, To wite wher men wolde yeve me any thing. My purchas is theffect of al my rente. Loke how thou rydest for the same entente, To winne good, thou rekkest never how; Right so fare I, for ryde wolde I now Un-to the worldes ende for a preye.’ ‘A,’ quod this Somnour, ‘benedicite, what sey ye? I wende ye were a yeman trewely. Ye han a mannes shap as wel as I; Han ye figure than determinat In helle, ther ye been in your estat?’ ‘Nay, certeinly,’ quod he, ‘ther have we noon; But whan us lyketh, we can take us oon, Or elles make yow seme we ben shape Som-tyme lyk a man, or lyk an ape; Or lyk an angel can I ryde or go. It is no wonder thing thogh it be so; A lousy Iogelour can deceyve thee, And pardee, yet can I more craft than he.’ ‘Why,’ quod the Somnour, ‘ryde ye thanne or goon In sondry shap, and nat alwey in oon?’ ‘For we,’ quod he, ‘wol us swich formes make As most able is our preyes for to take.’ ‘What maketh yow to han al this labour?’ ‘Ful many a cause, leve sir Somnour,’ Seyde this feend, ‘but alle thing hath tyme. The day is short, and it is passed pryme, And yet ne wan I no-thing in this day. I wol entende to winnen, if I may, And nat entende our wittes to declare. For, brother myn, thy wit is al to bare To understonde, al-thogh I tolde hem thee. But, for thou axest why labouren we; For, som-tyme, we ben goddes instruments, And menes to don his comandements, Whan that him list, up-on his creatures, In divers art and in divers figures. With-outen him we have no might, certayn, If that him list to stonden ther-agayn. And som-tyme, at our prayere, han we leve Only the body and nat the soule greve; Witnesse on Iob, whom that we diden wo. And som-tyme han we might of bothe two, This is to seyn, of soule and body eke. And somtyme be we suffred for to seke Up-on a man, and doon his soule unreste, And nat his body, and al is for the beste. Whan he withstandeth our temptacioun, It is a cause of his savacioun; Al-be-it that it was nat our entente He sholde be sauf, but that we wolde him hente. And som-tyme be we servant un-to man, As to the erchebisshop Seint Dunstan, And to the apostles servant eek was I.’ ‘Yet tel me,’ quod the Somnour, ‘feithfully, Make ye yow newe bodies thus alway Of elements?’ the feend answerde, ‘nay; Som-tyme we feyne, and som-tyme we aryse With dede bodies in ful sondry wyse, And speke as renably and faire and wel As to the Phitonissa dide Samuel. And yet wol som men seye it was nat he; I do no fors of your divinitee. But o thing warne I thee, I wol nat Iape, Thou wolt algates wite how we ben shape; Thou shalt her-afterward, my brother dere, Com ther thee nedeth nat of me to lere. For thou shalt by thyn owene experience Conne in a chayer rede of this sentence Bet than Virgyle, whyl he was on lyve, Or Dant also; now lat us ryde blyve. For I wol holde companye with thee Til it be so, that thou forsake me.’ ‘Nay,’ quod this Somnour, ‘that shal nat bityde; I am a yeman, knowen is ful wyde; My trouthe wol I holde as in this cas. For though thou were the devel Sathanas, My trouthe wol I holde to my brother, As I am sworn, and ech of us til other For to be trewe brother in this cas; And bothe we goon abouten our purchas. Tak thou thy part, what that men wol thee yive, And I shal myn; thus may we bothe live. And if that any of us have more than other, Lat him be trewe, and parte it with his brother.’ ‘I graunte,’ quod the devel, ‘by my fey.’ And with that word they ryden forth hir wey. And right at the entring of the tounes ende, To which this Somnour shoop him for to wende, They saugh a cart, that charged was with hey, Which that a carter droof forth in his wey. Deep was the wey, for which the carte stood. The carter smoot, and cryde, as he were wood, ‘Hayt, Brok! hayt, Scot! what spare ye for the stones? The feend,’ quod he, ‘yow fecche body and bones, As ferforthly as ever were ye foled! So muche wo as I have with yow tholed! The devel have al, bothe hors and cart and hey!’ This Somnour seyde, ‘heer shal we have a pley;’ And neer the feend he drough, as noght ne were, Ful prively, and rouned in his ere: ‘Herkne, my brother, herkne, by thy feith; Herestow nat how that the carter seith? Hent it anon, for he hath yeve it thee, Bothe hey and cart, and eek hise caples three.’ ‘Nay,’ quod the devel, ‘god wot, never a deel; It is nat his entente, trust me weel. Axe him thy-self, if thou nat trowest me, Or elles stint a while, and thou shalt see.’ This carter thakketh his hors upon the croupe, And they bigonne drawen and to-stoupe; ‘Heyt, now!’ quod he, ‘ther Iesu Crist yow blesse, And al his handwerk, bothe more and lesse! That was wel twight, myn owene lyard boy! I pray god save thee and sëynt Loy! Now is my cart out of the slow, pardee!’ ‘Lo! brother,’ quod the feend, ‘what tolde I thee? Heer may ye see, myn owene dere brother, The carl spak oo thing, but he thoghte another. Lat us go forth abouten our viage; Heer winne I no-thing up-on cariage.’ Whan that they comen som-what out of toune, This Somnour to his brother gan to roune, ‘Brother,’ quod he, ‘heer woneth an old rebekke, That hadde almost as lief to lese hir nekke As for to yeve a peny of hir good. I wol han twelf pens, though that she be wood, Or I wol sompne hir un-to our offyce; And yet, god woot, of hir knowe I no vyce. But for thou canst nat, as in this contree, Winne thy cost, tak heer ensample of me.’ This Somnour clappeth at the widwes gate. ‘Com out,’ quod he, ‘thou olde viritrate! I trowe thou hast som frere or preest with thee!’ ‘Who clappeth?’ seyde this widwe, ‘benedicite! God save you, sire, what is your swete wille?’ ‘I have,’ quod he, ‘of somonce here a bille; Up peyne of cursing, loke that thou be To-morn bifore the erchedeknes knee Tanswere to the court of certeyn thinges.’ ‘Now, lord,’ quod she, ‘Crist Iesu, king of kinges, So wisly helpe me, as I ne may. I have been syk, and that ful many a day. I may nat go so fer,’ quod she, ‘ne ryde, But I be deed, so priketh it in my syde. May I nat axe a libel, sir Somnour, And answere there, by my procutour, To swich thing as men wol opposen me?’ ‘Yis,’ quod this Somnour, ‘pay anon, lat se, Twelf pens to me, and I wol thee acquyte. I shall no profit han ther-by but lyte; My maister hath the profit, and nat I. Com of, and lat me ryden hastily; Yif me twelf pens, I may no lenger tarie.’ ‘Twelf pens,’ quod she, ‘now lady Seinte Marie So wisly help me out of care and sinne, This wyde world thogh that I sholde winne, Ne have I nat twelf pens with-inne myn hold. Ye knowen wel that I am povre and old; Kythe your almesse on me povre wrecche.’ ‘Nay than,’ quod he, ‘the foule feend me fecche If I thexcuse, though thou shul be spilt!’ ‘Alas,’ quod she, ‘god woot, I have no gilt.’ ‘Pay me,’ quod he, ‘or by the swete seinte Anne, As I wol bere awey thy newe panne For dette, which that thou owest me of old, Whan that thou madest thyn housbond cokewold, I payde at hoom for thy correccioun.’ ‘Thou lixt,’ quod she, ‘by my savacioun! Ne was I never er now, widwe ne wyf, Somoned un-to your court in al my lyf; Ne never I nas but of my body trewe! Un-to the devel blak and rough of hewe Yeve I thy body and my panne also!’ And whan the devel herde hir cursen so Up-on hir knees, he seyde in this manere, ‘Now Mabely, myn owene moder dere, Is this your wil in ernest, that ye seye?’ ‘The devel,’ quod she, ‘so fecche him er he deye, And panne and al, but he wol him repente!’ ‘Nay, olde stot, that is nat myn entente,’ Quod this Somnour, ‘for to repente me, For any thing that I have had of thee; I wolde I hadde thy smok and every clooth!’ ‘Now, brother,’ quod the devel, ‘be nat wrooth; Thy body and this panne ben myne by right. Thou shalt with me to helle yet to-night, Where thou shalt knowen of our privetee More than a maister of divinitee:’ And with that word this foule feend him hente; Body and soule, he with the devel wente Wher-as that somnours han hir heritage. And god, that maked after his image Mankinde, save and gyde us alle and some; And leve this Somnour good man to bicome! Lordinges, I coude han told yow, quod this Frere, Hadde I had leyser for this Somnour here, After the text of Crist [and] Poul and Iohn, And of our othere doctours many oon, Swiche peynes, that your hertes mighte agryse, Al-be-it so, no tonge may devyse, Thogh that I mighte a thousand winter telle, The peyne of thilke cursed hous of helle. But, for to kepe us fro that cursed place, Waketh, and preyeth Iesu for his grace So kepe us fro the temptour Sathanas. Herketh this word, beth war as in this cas; The leoun sit in his await alway To slee the innocent, if that he may. Disposeth ay your hertes to withstonde The feend, that yow wolde make thral and bonde. He may nat tempten yow over your might; For Crist wol be your champion and knight. And prayeth that thise Somnours hem repente Of hir misdedes, er that the feend hem hente. Here endeth the Freres tale. THE SOMNOUR'S PROLOGUE. The prologe of the Somnours Tale. This Somnour in his stiropes hye stood; Up-on this Frere his herte was so wood, That lyk an aspen leef he quook for yre. ‘Lordinges,’ quod he, ‘but o thing I desyre; I yow biseke that, of your curteisye, Sin ye han herd this false Frere lye, As suffereth me I may my tale telle! This Frere bosteth that he knoweth helle, And god it woot, that it is litel wonder; Freres and feendes been but lyte a-sonder. For pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle, How that a frere ravisshed was to helle In spirit ones by a visioun; And as an angel ladde him up and doun, To shewen him the peynes that ther were, In al the place saugh he nat a frere; Of other folk he saugh y-nowe in wo. Un-to this angel spak the frere tho: “Now, sir,” quod he, “han freres swich a grace That noon of hem shal come to this place?” “Yis,” quod this angel, “many a millioun!” And un-to Sathanas he ladde him doun. “And now hath Sathanas,” seith he, “a tayl Brodder than of a carrik is the sayl. Hold up thy tayl, thou Sathanas!” quod he, “Shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere see Wher is the nest of freres in this place!” And, er that half a furlong-wey of space, Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve, Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve Twenty thousand freres in a route, And thurgh-out helle swarmeden aboute; And comen agayn, as faste as they may gon, And in his ers they crepten everichon. He clapte his tayl agayn, and lay ful stille. This frere, whan he loked hadde his fille Upon the torments of this sory place, His spirit god restored of his grace Un-to his body agayn, and he awook; But natheles, for fere yet he quook, So was the develes ers ay in his minde, That is his heritage of verray kinde. God save yow alle, save this cursed Frere; My prologe wol I ende in this manere.’ Here endeth the Prologe of the Somnours Tale. THE SOMNOURS TALE. Here biginneth the Somonour his Tale. Lordinges, ther is in Yorkshire, as I gesse, A mersshy contree called Holdernesse, In which ther wente a limitour aboute, To preche, and eek to begge, it is no doute. And so bifel, that on a day this frere Had preched at a chirche in his manere, And specially, aboven every thing, Excited he the peple in his preching, To trentals, and to yeve, for goddes sake, Wher-with men mighten holy houses make, Ther as divyne service is honoured, Nat ther as it is wasted and devoured, Ne ther it nedeth nat for to be yive, As to possessioners, that mowen live, Thanked be god, in wele and habundaunce. ‘Trentals,’ seyde he, ‘deliveren fro penaunce Hir freendes soules, as wel olde as yonge, Ye, whan that they been hastily y-songe; Nat for to holde a preest Ioly and gay, He singeth nat but o masse in a day; Delivereth out,’ quod he, ‘anon the soules; Ful hard it is with fleshhook or with oules To been y-clawed, or to brenne or bake; Now spede yow hastily, for Cristes sake.’ And whan this frere had seyd al his entente, With qui cum patre forth his wey he wente. Whan folk in chirche had yeve him what hem leste, He wente his wey, no lenger wolde he reste, With scrippe and tipped staf, y-tukked hye; In every hous he gan to poure and prye, And beggeth mele, and chese, or elles corn. His felawe hadde a staf tipped with horn, A peyre of tables al of yvory, And a poyntel polisshed fetisly, And wroot the names alwey, as he stood, Of alle folk that yaf him any good, Ascaunces that he wolde for hem preye. ‘Yeve us a busshel whete, malt, or reye, A goddes kechil, or a trip of chese, Or elles what yow list, we may nat chese; A goddes halfpeny or a masse-peny, Or yeve us of your brawn, if ye have eny; A dagon of your blanket, leve dame, Our suster dere, lo! here I write your name; Bacon or beef, or swich thing as ye finde.’ A sturdy harlot wente ay hem bihinde, That was hir hostes man, and bar a sak, And what men yaf hem, leyde it on his bak. And whan that he was out at dore anon, He planed awey the names everichon That he biforn had writen in his tables; He served hem with nyfles and with fables. ‘Nay, ther thou lixt, thou Somnour,’ quod the Frere. ‘Pees,’ quod our Host, ‘for Cristes moder dere; Tel forth thy tale and spare it nat at al.’ So thryve I, quod this Somnour, so I shal.— So longe he wente hous by hous, til he Cam til an hous ther he was wont to be Refresshed more than in an hundred placis. Sik lay the gode man, whos that the place is; Bedrede up-on a couche lowe he lay. ‘Deus hic,’ quod he, ‘O Thomas, freend, good day,’ Seyde this frere curteisly and softe. ‘Thomas,’ quod he, ‘god yelde yow! ful ofte Have I up-on this bench faren ful weel. Here have I eten many a mery meel’; And fro the bench he droof awey the cat, And leyde adoun his potente and his hat, And eek his scrippe, and sette him softe adoun. His felawe was go walked in-to toun, Forth with his knave, in-to that hostelrye Wher-as he shoop him thilke night to lye. ‘O dere maister,’ quod this syke man, ‘How han ye fare sith that March bigan? I saugh yow noght this fourtenight or more.’ ‘God woot,’ quod he, ‘laboured have I ful sore; And specially, for thy savacioun Have I seyd many a precious orisoun, And for our othere frendes, god hem blesse! I have to-day been at your chirche at messe, And seyd a sermon after my simple wit, Nat al after the text of holy writ; For it is hard to yow, as I suppose, And therfore wol I teche yow al the glose. Glosinge is a glorious thing, certeyn, For lettre sleeth, so as we clerkes seyn. Ther have I taught hem to be charitable, And spende hir good ther it is resonable, And ther I saugh our dame; a! wher is she?’ ‘Yond in the yerd I trowe that she be,’ Seyde this man, ‘and she wol come anon.’ ‘Ey, maister! wel-come be ye, by seint Iohn!’ Seyde this wyf, ‘how fare ye hertely?’ The frere aryseth up ful curteisly, And hir embraceth in his armes narwe, And kiste hir swete, and chirketh as a sparwe With his lippes: ‘dame,’ quod he, ‘right weel, As he that is your servant every deel. Thanked be god, that yow yaf soule and lyf, Yet saugh I nat this day so fair a wyf In al the chirche, god so save me!’ ‘Ye, god amende defautes, sir,’ quod she, ‘Algates wel-come be ye, by my fey!’ ‘Graunt mercy, dame, this have I founde alwey. But of your grete goodnesse, by your leve, I wolde prey yow that ye nat yow greve, I wol with Thomas speke a litel throwe. Thise curats been ful necligent and slowe To grope tendrely a conscience. In shrift, in preching is my diligence, And studie in Petres wordes, and in Poules. I walke, and fisshe Cristen mennes soules, To yelden Iesu Crist his propre rente; To sprede his word is set al myn entente.’ ‘Now, by your leve, o dere sir,’ quod she, ‘Chydeth him weel, for seinte Trinitee. He is as angry as a pissemyre, Though that he have al that he can desyre. Though I him wrye a-night and make him warm, And on hym leye my leg outher myn arm, He groneth lyk our boor, lyth in our sty. Other desport right noon of him have I; I may nat plese him in no maner cas.’ ‘O Thomas! Ie vous dy, Thomas! Thomas! This maketh the feend, this moste ben amended. Ire is a thing that hye god defended, And ther-of wol I speke a word or two.’ ‘Now maister,’ quod the wyf, ‘er that I go, What wol ye dyne? I wol go ther-aboute.’ ‘Now dame,’ quod he, ‘Ie vous dy sanz doute, Have I nat of a capon but the livere, And of your softe breed nat but a shivere, And after that a rosted pigges heed, (But that I nolde no beest for me were deed), Thanne hadde I with yow hoomly suffisaunce. I am a man of litel sustenaunce. My spirit hath his fostring in the Bible. The body is ay so redy and penyble To wake, that my stomak is destroyed. I prey yow, dame, ye be nat anoyed, Though I so freendly yow my conseil shewe; By god, I wolde nat telle it but a fewe.’ ‘Now, sir,’ quod she, ‘but o word er I go; My child is deed with-inne thise wykes two, Sone after that ye wente out of this toun.’ ‘His deeth saugh I by revelacioun,’ Seith this frere, ‘at hoom in our dortour. I dar wel seyn that, er that half an hour After his deeth, I saugh him born to blisse In myn avisioun, so god me wisse! So dide our sexteyn and our fermerer, That han been trewe freres fifty yeer; They may now, god be thanked of his lone, Maken hir Iubilee and walke allone. And up I roos, and al our covent eke, With many a tere trikling on my cheke, Withouten noyse or clateringe of belles; Te deum was our song and no-thing elles, Save that to Crist I seyde an orisoun, Thankinge him of his revelacioun. For sir and dame, trusteth me right weel, Our orisons been more effectueel, And more we seen of Cristes secree thinges Than burel folk, al-though they weren kinges. We live in povert and in abstinence, And burel folk in richesse and despence Of mete and drinke, and in hir foul delyt. We han this worldes lust al in despyt. Lazar and Dives liveden diversly, And diverse guerdon hadden they ther-by. Who-so wol preye, he moot faste and be clene, And fatte his soule and make his body lene. We fare as seith thapostle; cloth and fode Suffysen us, though they be nat ful gode. The clennesse and the fastinge of us freres Maketh that Crist accepteth our preyeres. Lo, Moyses fourty dayes and fourty night Fasted, er that the heighe god of might Spak with him in the mountain of Sinay. With empty wombe, fastinge many a day, Receyved he the lawe that was writen With goddes finger; and Elie, wel ye witen, In mount Oreb, er he hadde any speche With hye god, that is our lyves leche, He fasted longe and was in contemplaunce. Aaron, that hadde the temple in governaunce, And eek the othere preestes everichon, In-to the temple whan they sholde gon To preye for the peple, and do servyse, They nolden drinken, in no maner wyse, No drinke, which that mighte hem dronke make, But there in abstinence preye and wake, Lest that they deyden; tak heed what I seye. But they be sobre that for the peple preye, War that I seye,—namore! for it suffyseth. Our lord Iesu, as holy writ devyseth, Yaf us ensample of fastinge and preyeres. Therfor we mendinants, we sely freres, Been wedded to poverte and continence, To charitee, humblesse, and abstinence, To persecucion for rightwisnesse, To wepinge, misericorde, and clennesse. And therfor may ye see that our preyeres— I speke of us, we mendinants, we freres— Ben to the hye god more acceptable Than youres, with your festes at the table. Fro Paradys first, if I shal nat lye, Was man out chaced for his glotonye; And chaast was man in Paradys, certeyn. But herkne now, Thomas, what I shal seyn. I ne have no text of it, as I suppose, But I shall finde it in a maner glose, That specially our swete lord Iesus Spak this by freres, whan he seyde thus: “Blessed be they that povre in spirit been.” And so forth al the gospel may ye seen, Wher it be lyker our professioun, Or hirs that swimmen in possessioun. Fy on hir pompe and on hir glotonye! And for hir lewednesse I hem diffye. Me thinketh they ben lyk Iovinian, Fat as a whale, and walkinge as a swan; Al vinolent as botel in the spence. Hir preyer is of ful gret reverence; Whan they for soules seye the psalm of Davit, Lo, “buf!” they seye, “cor meum eructavit!” Who folweth Cristes gospel and his fore, But we that humble been and chast and pore, Werkers of goddes word, not auditours? Therfore, right as an hauk up, at a sours, Up springeth in-to their, right so prayeres Of charitable and chaste bisy freres Maken hir sours to goddes eres two. Thomas! Thomas! so mote I ryde or go, And by that lord that clepid is seint Yve, Nere thou our brother, sholdestou nat thryve! In our chapitre praye we day and night To Crist, that he thee sende hele and might, Thy body for to welden hastily.’ ‘God woot,’ quod he, ‘no-thing ther-of fele I; As help me Crist, as I, in fewe yeres, Han spended, up-on dyvers maner freres, Ful many a pound; yet fare I never the bet. Certeyn, my good have I almost biset. Farwel, my gold! for it is al ago!’ The frere answerde, ‘O Thomas, dostow so? What nedeth yow diverse freres seche? What nedeth him that hath a parfit leche To sechen othere leches in the toun? Your inconstance is your confusioun. Holde ye than me, or elles our covent, To praye for yow ben insufficient? Thomas, that Iape nis nat worth a myte; Your maladye is for we han to lyte. “A! yif that covent half a quarter otes!” “A! yif that covent four and twenty grotes!” “A! yif that frere a peny, and lat him go!” Nay, nay, Thomas! it may no-thing be so. What is a ferthing worth parted in twelve? Lo, ech thing that is oned in him-selve Is more strong than whan it is to-scatered. Thomas, of me thou shalt nat been y-flatered; Thou woldest han our labour al for noght. The hye god, that al this world hath wroght, Seith that the werkman worthy is his hyre. Thomas! noght of your tresor I desyre As for my-self, but that al our covent To preye for yow is ay so diligent, And for to builden Cristes owene chirche. Thomas! if ye wol lernen for to wirche, Of buildinge up of chirches may ye finde If it be good, in Thomas lyf of Inde. Ye lye heer, ful of anger and of yre, With which the devel set your herte a-fyre, And chyden heer this sely innocent, Your wyf, that is so meke and pacient. And therfor, Thomas, trowe me if thee leste, Ne stryve nat with thy wyf, as for thy beste; And ber this word awey now, by thy feith, Touchinge this thing, lo, what the wyse seith: “With-in thyn hous ne be thou no leoun; To thy subgits do noon oppressioun; Ne make thyne aqueyntances nat to flee.” And Thomas, yet eft-sones I charge thee, Be war from hir that in thy bosom slepeth; War fro the serpent that so slyly crepeth Under the gras, and stingeth subtilly. Be war, my sone, and herkne paciently, That twenty thousand men han lost hir lyves, For stryving with hir lemmans and hir wyves. Now sith ye han so holy and meke a wyf, What nedeth yow, Thomas, to maken stryf? Ther nis, y-wis, no serpent so cruel, Whan man tret on his tayl, ne half so fel, As womman is, whan she hath caught an ire; Vengeance is thanne al that they desyre. Ire is a sinne, oon of the grete of sevene, Abhominable un-to the god of hevene; And to him-self it is destruccion. This every lewed viker or person Can seye, how Ire engendreth homicyde. Ire is, in sooth, executour of pryde. I coude of Ire seye so muche sorwe, My tale sholde laste til to-morwe. And therfor preye I god bothe day and night, An irous man, god sende him litel might! It is greet harm and, certes, gret pitee, To sette an irous man in heigh degree. Whilom ther was an irous potestat, As seith Senek, that, duringe his estaat, Up-on a day out riden knightes two, And as fortune wolde that it were so, That oon of hem cam hoom, that other noght. Anon the knight bifore the Iuge is broght, That seyde thus, ‘thou hast thy felawe slayn, For which I deme thee to the deeth, certayn.’ And to another knight comanded he, ‘Go lede him to the deeth, I charge thee.’ And happed, as they wente by the weye Toward the place ther he sholde deye, The knight cam, which men wenden had be deed. Thanne thoughte they, it was the beste reed, To lede hem bothe to the Iuge agayn. They seiden, ‘lord, the knight ne hath nat slayn His felawe; here he standeth hool alyve.’ ‘Ye shul be deed,’ quod he, ‘so moot I thryve! That is to seyn, bothe oon, and two, and three!’ And to the firste knight right thus spak he, ‘I dampned thee, thou most algate be deed. And thou also most nedes lese thyn heed, For thou art cause why thy felawe deyth.’ And to the thridde knight right thus he seyth, ‘Thou hast nat doon that I comanded thee.’ And thus he dide don sleen hem alle three. Irous Cambyses was eek dronkelewe, And ay delyted him to been a shrewe. And so bifel, a lord of his meynee, That lovede vertuous moralitee, Seyde on a day bitwix hem two right thus: ‘A lord is lost, if he be vicious; And dronkenesse is eek a foul record Of any man, and namely in a lord. Ther is ful many an eye and many an ere Awaiting on a lord, and he noot where. For goddes love, drink more attemprely; Wyn maketh man to lesen wrecchedly His minde, and eek his limes everichon.’ ‘The revers shaltou se,’ quod he, ‘anon; And preve it, by thyn owene experience, That wyn ne dooth to folk no swich offence. Ther is no wyn bireveth me my might Of hand ne foot, ne of myn eyen sight’— And, for despyt, he drank ful muchel more An hondred part than he had doon bifore; And right anon, this irous cursed wrecche Leet this knightes sone bifore him fecche, Comandinge him he sholde bifore him stonde. And sodeynly he took his bowe in honde, And up the streng he pulled to his ere, And with an arwe he slow the child right there: ‘Now whether have I a siker hand or noon?’ Quod he, ‘is al my might and minde agoon? Hath wyn bireved me myn eyen sight?’ What sholde I telle thanswere of the knight? His sone was slayn, ther is na-more to seye. Beth war therfor with lordes how ye pleye. Singeth Placebo, and I shal, if I can, But if it be un-to a povre man. To a povre man men sholde hise vyces telle, But nat to a lord, thogh he sholde go to helle. Lo irous Cirus, thilke Percien, How he destroyed the river of Gysen, For that an hors of his was dreynt ther-inne, Whan that he wente Babiloigne to winne. He made that the river was so smal, That wommen mighte wade it over al. Lo, what seyde he, that so wel teche can? “Ne be no felawe to an irous man, Ne with no wood man walke by the weye, Lest thee repente;” ther is na-more to seye. Now Thomas, leve brother, lef thyn ire; Thou shalt me finde as Iust as is a squire. Hold nat the develes knyf ay at thyn herte; Thyn angre dooth thee al to sore smerte; But shewe to me al thy confessioun.’ ‘Nay,’ quod the syke man, ‘by Seint Simoun! I have be shriven this day at my curat; I have him told al hoolly myn estat; Nedeth na-more to speke of it,’ seith he, ‘But if me list of myn humilitee.’ ‘Yif me thanne of thy gold, to make our cloistre,’ Quod he, ‘for many a muscle and many an oistre, Whan other men han ben ful wel at eyse, Hath been our fode, our cloistre for to reyse. And yet, god woot, unnethe the fundement Parfourned is, ne of our pavement Nis nat a tyle yet with-inne our wones; By god, we owen fourty pound for stones! Now help, Thomas, for him that harwed helle! For elles moste we our bokes selle. And if ye lakke our predicacioun, Than gooth the world al to destruccioun. For who-so wolde us fro this world bireve, So god me save, Thomas, by your leve, He wolde bireve out of this world the sonne. For who can teche and werchen as we conne? And that is nat of litel tyme,’ quod he; ‘But sith that Elie was, or Elisee, Han freres been, that finde I of record, In charitee, y-thanked be our lord. Now Thomas, help, for seinte charitee!’ And doun anon he sette him on his knee. This syke man wex wel ny wood for ire; He wolde that the frere had been on-fire With his false dissimulacioun. ‘Swich thing as is in my possessioun,’ Quod he, ‘that may I yeven, and non other. Ye sey me thus, how that I am your brother?’ ‘Ye, certes,’ quod the frere, ‘trusteth weel; I took our dame our lettre with our seel.’ ‘Now wel,’ quod he, ‘and som-what shal I yive Un-to your holy covent whyl I live, And in thyn hand thou shalt it have anoon; On this condicioun, and other noon, That thou departe it so, my dere brother, That every frere have also muche as other. This shaltou swere on thy professioun, With-outen fraude or cavillacioun.’ ‘I swere it,’ quod this frere, ‘upon my feith!’ And ther-with-al his hand in his he leith: ‘Lo, heer my feith! in me shal be no lak.’ ‘Now thanne, put thyn hand doun by my bak,’ Seyde this man, ‘and grope wel bihinde; Bynethe my buttok ther shaltow finde A thing that I have hid in privetee.’ ‘A!’ thoghte this frere, ‘this shal go with me!’ And doun his hand he launcheth to the clifte, In hope for to finde ther a yifte. And whan this syke man felte this frere Aboute his tuwel grope there and here, Amidde his hand he leet the frere a fart. Ther nis no capul, drawinge in a cart, That mighte have lete a fart of swich a soun. ‘The frere up stirte as doth a wood leoun: ‘A! false cherl,’ qoud he, ‘for goddes bones, This hastow for despyt doon, for the nones! Thou shalt abye this fart, if that I may!’ His meynee, whiche that herden this affray, Cam lepinge in, and chaced out the frere; And forth he gooth, with a ful angry chere, And fette his felawe, ther-as lay his stoor. He looked as it were a wilde boor; He grinte with his teeth, so was he wrooth. A sturdy pas doun to the court he gooth, Wher-as ther woned a man of greet honour, To whom that he was alwey confessour; This worthy man was lord of that village. This frere cam, as he were in a rage, Wher-as this lord sat eting at his bord. Unnethes mighte the frere speke a word, Til atte laste he seyde: ‘god yow see!’ This lord gan loke, and seide, ‘benedicite! What, frere Iohn, what maner world is this? I see wel that som thing ther is amis. Ye loken as the wode were ful of thevis, Sit doun anon, and tel me what your greef is, And it shal been amended, if I may.’ ‘I have,’ quod he, ‘had a despyt this day, God yelde yow! adoun in your village, That in this world is noon so povre a page, That he nolde have abhominacioun Of that I have receyved in your toun. And yet ne greveth me no-thing so sore, As that this olde cherl, with lokkes hore, Blasphemed hath our holy covent eke.’ ‘Now, maister,’ quod this lord, ‘I yow biseke.’ ‘No maister, sire,’ quod he, ‘but servitour, Thogh I have had in scole swich honour. God lyketh nat that “Raby” men us calle, Neither in market ne in your large halle.’ ‘No fors,’ quod he, ‘but tel me al your grief.’ ‘Sire,’ quod this frere, ‘an odious meschief This day bitid is to myn ordre and me, And so per consequens to ech degree Of holy chirche, god amende it sone!’ ‘Sir,’ quod the lord, ‘ye woot what is to done. Distempre yow noght, ye be my confessour; Ye been the salt of the erthe and the savour. For goddes love your pacience ye holde; Tel me your grief:’ and he anon him tolde, As ye han herd biforn, ye woot wel what. The lady of the hous ay stille sat, Til she had herd al what the frere sayde: ‘Ey, goddes moder,’ quod she, ‘blisful mayde! Is ther oght elles? telle me feithfully.’ ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘how thinketh yow her-by?’ ‘How that me thinketh?’ quod she; ‘so god me speede, I seye, a cherl hath doon a cherles dede. What shold I seye? god lat him never thee! His syke heed is ful of vanitee, I hold him in a maner frenesye.’ ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘by god I shal nat lye; But I on other weyes may be wreke, I shal diffame him over-al ther I speke, This false blasphemour, that charged me To parte that wol nat departed be, To every man y-liche, with meschaunce!’ The lord sat stille as he were in a traunce, And in his herte he rolled up and doun, ‘How hadde this cherl imaginacioun To shewe swich a probleme to the frere? Never erst er now herde I of swich matere; I trowe the devel putte it in his minde. In ars-metryke shal ther no man finde, Biforn this day, of swich a questioun. Who sholde make a demonstracioun, That every man sholde have y-liche his part As of the soun or savour of a fart? O nyce proude cherl, I shrewe his face! Lo, sires,’ quod the lord, with harde grace, ‘Who ever herde of swich a thing er now? To every man y-lyke? tel me how? It is an inpossible, it may nat be! Ey, nyce cherl, god lete him never thee! The rumblinge of a fart, and every soun, Nis but of eir reverberacioun, And ever it wasteth lyte and lyte awey. Ther is no man can demen, by my fey, If that it were departed equally. What, lo, my cherl, lo, yet how shrewedly Un-to my confessour to-day he spak! I holde him certeyn a demoniak! Now ete your mete, and lat the cherl go pleye, Lat him go honge himself, a devel weye!’ Now stood the lordes squyer at the bord, That carf his mete, and herde, word by word, Of alle thinges of which I have yow sayd. ‘My lord,’ quod he, ‘be ye nat yvel apayd; I coude telle, for a goune-clooth, To yow, sir frere, so ye be nat wrooth, How that this fart sholde even deled be Among your covent, if it lyked me.’ ‘Tel,’ quod the lord, ‘and thou shalt have anon A goune-cloth, by god and by Seint Iohn!’ ‘My lord,’ quod he, ‘whan that the weder is fair, With-outen wind or perturbinge of air, Lat bringe a cartwheel here in-to this halle, But loke that it have his spokes alle. Twelf spokes hath a cartwheel comunly. And bring me than twelf freres, woot ye why? For thrittene is a covent, as I gesse. The confessour heer, for his worthinesse, Shal parfourne up the nombre of his covent. Than shal they knele doun, by oon assent, And to every spokes ende, in this manere, Ful sadly leye his nose shal a frere. Your noble confessour, ther god him save, Shal holde his nose upright, under the nave. Than shal this cherl, with bely stif and toght As any tabour, hider been y-broght; And sette him on the wheel right of this cart, Upon the nave, and make him lete a fart. And ye shul seen, up peril of my lyf, By preve which that is demonstratif, That equally the soun of it wol wende, And eek the stink, un-to the spokes ende; Save that this worthy man, your confessour, By-cause he is a man of greet honour, Shal have the firste fruit, as reson is; The noble usage of freres yet is this, The worthy men of hem shul first be served; And certeinly, he hath it weel deserved. He hath to-day taught us so muchel good With preching in the pulpit ther he stood, That I may vouche-sauf, I sey for me, He hadde the firste smel of fartes three, And so wolde al his covent hardily; He bereth him so faire and holily.’ The lord, the lady, and ech man, save the frere, Seyde that Iankin spak, in this matere, As wel as Euclide or [as] Ptholomee. Touchinge this cherl, they seyde, subtiltee And heigh wit made him speken as he spak; He nis no fool, ne no demoniak. And Iankin hath y-wonne a newe goune.— My tale is doon; we been almost at toune. Here endeth the Somnours Tale. GROUP E. THE CLERK'S PROLOGUE. Here folweth the Prologe of the Clerkes Tale of Oxenford. ‘Sir clerk of Oxenford,’ our hoste sayde, ‘Ye ryde as coy and stille as dooth a mayde, Were newe spoused, sitting at the bord; This day ne herde I of your tonge a word. I trowe ye studie aboute som sophyme, But Salomon seith, “every thing hath tyme.” For goddes sake, as beth of bettre chere, It is no tyme for to studien here. Telle us som mery tale, by your fey; For what man that is entred in a pley, He nedes moot unto the pley assente. But precheth nat, as freres doon in Lente, To make us for our olde sinnes wepe, Ne that thy tale make us nat to slepe. Telle us som mery thing of aventures;— Your termes, your colours, and your figures, Kepe hem in stoor til so be ye endyte Heigh style, as whan that men to kinges wryte. Speketh so pleyn at this tyme, I yow preye, That we may understonde what ye seye.’ This worthy clerk benignely answerde, ‘Hoste,’ quod he, ‘I am under your yerde; Ye han of us as now the governaunce, And therfor wol I do yow obeisaunce, As fer as reson axeth, hardily. I wol yow telle a tale which that I Lerned at Padowe of a worthy clerk, As preved by his wordes and his werk. He is now deed and nayled in his cheste, I prey to god so yeve his soule reste! Fraunceys Petrark, the laureat poete, Highte this clerk, whos rethoryke sweete Enlumined al Itaille of poetrye, As Linian dide of philosophye Or lawe, or other art particuler; But deeth, that wol nat suffre us dwellen heer But as it were a twinkling of an yë, Hem bothe hath slayn, and alle shul we dyë. But forth to tellen of this worthy man, That taughte me this tale, as I bigan, I seye that first with heigh style he endyteth, Er he the body of his tale wryteth, A proheme, in the which discryveth he Pemond, and of Saluces the contree, And speketh of Apennyn, the hilles hye, That been the boundes of West Lumbardye, And of Mount Vesulus in special, Where as the Poo, out of a welle smal, Taketh his firste springing and his sours, That estward ay encresseth in his cours To Emelward, to Ferrare, and Venyse: The which a long thing were to devyse. And trewely, as to my Iugement, Me thinketh it a thing impertinent, Save that he wol conveyen his matere: But this his tale, which that ye may here.’ THE CLERKES TALE. Here biginneth the Tale of the Clerk of Oxenford. [Pars Prima.] Ther is, at the west syde of Itaille, Doun at the rote of Vesulus the colde, A lusty playne, habundant of vitaille, Wher many a tour and toun thou mayst biholde, That founded were in tyme of fadres olde, And many another delitable sighte, And Saluces this noble contree highte. A markis whylom lord was of that londe, As were his worthy eldres him bifore; And obeisant and redy to his honde Were alle his liges, bothe lasse and more. Thus in delyt he liveth, and hath don yore, Biloved and drad, thurgh favour of fortune, Bothe of his lordes and of his commune. Therwith he was, to speke as of linage, The gentilleste y-born of Lumbardye, A fair persone, and strong, and yong of age, And ful of honour and of curteisye; Discreet y-nogh his contree for to gye, Save in somme thinges that he was to blame, And Walter was this yonge lordes name. I blame him thus, that he considereth noght In tyme cominge what mighte him bityde, But on his lust present was al his thoght, As for to hauke and hunte on every syde; Wel ny alle othere cures leet he slyde, And eek he nolde, and that was worst of alle, Wedde no wyf, for noght that may bifalle. Only that point his peple bar so sore, That flokmele on a day they to him wente, And oon of hem, that wysest was of lore, Or elles that the lord best wolde assente That he sholde telle him what his peple mente, Or elles coude he shewe wel swich matere, He to the markis seyde as ye shul here. ‘O noble markis, your humanitee Assureth us and yeveth us hardinesse, As ofte as tyme is of necessitee That we to yow mowe telle our hevinesse; Accepteth, lord, now for your gentillesse, That we with pitous herte un-to yow pleyne, And lete your eres nat my voys disdeyne. Al have I noght to done in this matere More than another man hath in this place, Yet for as muche as ye, my lord so dere, Han alwey shewed me favour and grace, I dar the better aske of yow a space Of audience, to shewen our requeste, And ye, my lord, to doon right as yow leste. For certes, lord, so wel us lyketh yow And al your werk and ever han doon, that we Ne coude nat us self devysen how We mighte liven in more felicitee, Save o thing, lord, if it your wille be, That for to been a wedded man yow leste, Than were your peple in sovereyn hertes reste. Boweth your nekke under that blisful yok Of soveraynetee, noght of servyse, Which that men clepeth spousaille or wedlok; And thenketh, lord, among your thoghtes wyse, How that our dayes passe in sondry wyse; For though we slepe or wake, or rome, or ryde, Ay fleeth the tyme, it nil no man abyde. And though your grene youthe floure as yit, In crepeth age alwey, as stille as stoon, And deeth manaceth every age, and smit In ech estaat, for ther escapeth noon: And al so certein as we knowe echoon That we shul deye, as uncerteyn we alle Been of that day whan deeth shal on us falle. Accepteth than of us the trewe entente, That never yet refuseden your heste, And we wol, lord, if that ye wol assente, Chese yow a wyf in short tyme, atte leste, Born of the gentilleste and of the meste Of al this lond, so that it oghte seme Honour to god and yow, as we can deme. Deliver us out of al this bisy drede, And tak a wyf, for hye goddes sake; For if it so bifelle, as god forbede, That thurgh your deeth your linage sholde slake, And that a straunge successour sholde take Your heritage, o! wo were us alyve! Wherfor we pray you hastily to wyve.’ Hir meke preyere and hir pitous chere Made the markis herte han pitee. ‘Ye wol,’ quod he, ‘myn owene peple dere, To that I never erst thoghte streyne me. I me reioysed of my libertee, That selde tyme is founde in mariage; Ther I was free, I moot been in servage. But nathelees I see your trewe entente, And truste upon your wit, and have don ay; Wherfor of my free wil I wol assente To wedde me, as sone as ever I may. But ther-as ye han profred me to-day To chese me a wyf, I yow relesse That choys, and prey yow of that profre cesse. For god it woot, that children ofte been Unlyk her worthy eldres hem bifore; Bountee comth al of god, nat of the streen Of which they been engendred and y-bore; I truste in goddes bountee, and therfore My mariage and myn estaat and reste I him bitake; he may don as him leste. Lat me alone in chesinge of my wyf, That charge up-on my bak I wol endure; But I yow preye, and charge up-on your lyf, That what wyf that I take, ye me assure To worshipe hir, whyl that hir lyf may dure, In word and werk, bothe here and everywhere, As she an emperoures doghter were. And forthermore, this shal ye swere, that ye Agayn my choys shul neither grucche ne stryve; For sith I shal forgoon my libertee At your requeste, as ever moot I thryve, Ther as myn herte is set, ther wol I wyve; And but ye wole assente in swich manere, I prey yow, speketh na-more of this matere.’ With hertly wil they sworen, and assenten To al this thing, ther seyde no wight nay; Bisekinge him of grace, er that they wenten, That he wolde graunten hem a certein day Of his spousaille, as sone as ever he may; For yet alwey the peple som-what dredde Lest that this markis no wyf wolde wedde. He graunted hem a day, swich as him leste, On which he wolde be wedded sikerly, And seyde, he dide al this at hir requeste; And they, with humble entente, buxomly, Knelinge up-on her knees ful reverently Him thanken alle, and thus they han an ende Of hir entente, and hoom agayn they wende. And heer-up-on he to his officeres Comaundeth for the feste to purveye, And to his privee knightes and squyeres Swich charge yaf, as him liste on hem leye; And they to his comandement obeye, And ech of hem doth al his diligence To doon un-to the feste reverence. Explicit prima pars. Incipit secunda pars. [Pars Secunda.] Noght fer fro thilke paleys honurable Ther-as this markis shoop his mariage, Ther stood a throp, of site delitable, In which that povre folk of that village Hadden hir bestes and hir herbergage, And of hir labour took hir sustenance After that the erthe yaf hem habundance. Amonges thise povre folk ther dwelte a man Which that was holden povrest of hem alle; But hye god som tyme senden can His grace in-to a litel oxes stalle: Ianicula men of that throp him calle. A doghter hadde he, fair y-nogh to sighte, And Grisildis this yonge mayden highte. But for to speke of vertuous beautee, Than was she oon the faireste under sonne; For povreliche y-fostred up was she, No likerous lust was thurgh hir herte y-ronne; Wel ofter of the welle than of the tonne She drank, and for she wolde vertu plese, She knew wel labour, but non ydel ese. But thogh this mayde tendre were of age, Yet in the brest of hir virginitee Ther was enclosed rype and sad corage; And in greet reverence and charitee Hir olde povre fader fostred she; A fewe sheep spinning on feeld she kepte, She wolde noght been ydel til she slepte. And whan she hoomward cam, she wolde bringe Wortes or othere herbes tymes ofte, The whiche she shredde and seeth for hir livinge, And made hir bed ful harde and no-thing softe; And ay she kepte hir fadres lyf on-lofte With everich obeisaunce and diligence That child may doon to fadres reverence. Up-on Grisilde, this povre creature, Ful ofte sythe this markis sette his yë As he on hunting rood paraventure; And whan it fil that he mighte hir espye, He noght with wantoun loking of folye His yën caste on hir, but in sad wyse Up-on hir chere he wolde him ofte avyse, Commending in his herte hir wommanhede, And eek hir vertu, passing any wight Of so yong age, as wel in chere as dede. For thogh the peple have no greet insight In vertu, he considered ful right Hir bountee, and disposed that he wolde Wedde hir only, if ever he wedde sholde. The day of wedding cam, but no wight can Telle what womman that it sholde be; For which merveille wondred many a man, And seyden, whan they were in privetee, ‘Wol nat our lord yet leve his vanitee? Wol he nat wedde? allas, allas the whyle! Why wol he thus him-self and us bigyle?’ But natheles this markis hath don make Of gemmes, set in gold and in asure, Broches and ringes, for Grisildis sake, And of hir clothing took he the mesure By a mayde, lyk to hir stature, And eek of othere ornamentes alle That un-to swich a wedding sholde falle. The tyme of undern of the same day Approcheth, that this wedding sholde be; And al the paleys put was in array, Bothe halle and chambres, ech in his degree; Houses of office stuffed with plentee Ther maystow seen of deyntevous vitaille, That may be founde, as fer as last Itaille. This royal markis, richely arrayed, Lordes and ladyes in his companye, The whiche unto the feste were y-prayed, And of his retenue the bachelrye, With many a soun of sondry melodye, Un-to the village, of the which I tolde, In this array the righte wey han holde. Grisilde of this, god woot, ful innocent, That for hir shapen was al this array, To fecchen water at a welle is went, And cometh hoom as sone as ever she may. For wel she hadde herd seyd, that thilke day The markis sholde wedde, and, if she mighte, She wolde fayn han seyn som of that sighte. She thoghte, ‘I wol with othere maydens stonde, That been my felawes, in our dore, and see The markisesse, and therfor wol I fonde To doon at hoom, as sone as it may be, The labour which that longeth un-to me; And than I may at leyser hir biholde, If she this wey un-to the castel holde.’ And as she wolde over hir threshfold goon, The markis cam and gan hir for to calle; And she sette doun hir water-pot anoon Bisyde the threshfold, in an oxes stalle, And doun up-on hir knees she gan to falle, And with sad contenance kneleth stille Til she had herd what was the lordes wille. This thoghtful markis spak un-to this mayde Ful sobrely, and seyde in this manere, ‘Wher is your fader, Grisildis?’ he sayde, And she with reverence, in humble chere, Answerde, ‘lord, he is al redy here.’ And in she gooth with-outen lenger lette, And to the markis she hir fader fette. He by the hond than took this olde man, And seyde thus, whan he him hadde asyde, ‘Ianicula, I neither may ne can Lenger the plesance of myn herte hyde. If that thou vouche-sauf, what-so bityde, Thy doghter wol I take, er that I wende, As for my wyf, un-to hir lyves ende. Thou lovest me, I woot it wel, certeyn, And art my feithful lige man y-bore; And al that lyketh me, I dar wel seyn It lyketh thee, and specially therfore Tel me that poynt that I have seyd bifore, If that thou wolt un-to that purpos drawe, To take me as for thy sone-in-lawe?’ This sodeyn cas this man astoned so, That reed he wex, abayst, and al quaking He stood; unnethes seyde he wordes mo, But only thus: ‘lord,’ quod he, ‘my willing Is as ye wole, ne ayeines your lyking I wol no-thing; ye be my lord so dere; Right as yow lust governeth this matere.’ ‘Yet wol I,’ quod this markis softely, ‘That in thy chambre I and thou and she Have a collacion, and wostow why? For I wol axe if it hir wille be To be my wyf, and reule hir after me; And al this shal be doon in thy presence, I wol noght speke out of thyn audience.’ And in the chambre whyl they were aboute Hir tretis, which as ye shal after here, The peple cam un-to the hous with-oute, And wondred hem in how honest manere And tentifly she kepte hir fader dere. But outerly Grisildis wondre mighte, For never erst ne saugh she swich a sighte. No wonder is thogh that she were astoned To seen so greet a gest come in that place; She never was to swiche gestes woned, For which she loked with ful pale face. But shortly forth this tale for to chace, Thise arn the wordes that the markis sayde To this benigne verray feithful mayde. ‘Grisilde,’ he seyde, ‘ye shul wel understonde It lyketh to your fader and to me That I yow wedde, and eek it may so stonde, As I suppose, ye wol that it so be. But thise demandes axe I first,’ quod he, ‘That, sith it shal be doon in hastif wyse, Wol ye assente, or elles yow avyse? I seye this, be ye redy with good herte To al my lust, and that I frely may, As me best thinketh, do yow laughe or smerte, And never ye to grucche it, night ne day? And eek whan I sey “ye,” ne sey nat “nay,” Neither by word ne frowning contenance; Swer this, and here I swere our alliance.’ Wondring upon this word, quaking for drede, She seyde, ‘lord, undigne and unworthy Am I to thilke honour that ye me bede; But as ye wol your-self, right so wol I. And heer I swere that never willingly In werk ne thoght I nil yow disobeye, For to be deed, though me were looth to deye.’ ‘This is y-nogh, Grisilde myn!’ quod he. And forth he gooth with a ful sobre chere Out at the dore, and after that cam she, And to the peple he seyde in this manere, ‘This is my wyf,’ quod he, ‘that standeth here. Honoureth hir, and loveth hir, I preye, Who-so me loveth; ther is na-more to seye.’ And for that no-thing of hir olde gere She sholde bringe in-to his hous, he bad That wommen sholde dispoilen hir right there; Of which thise ladyes were nat right glad To handle hir clothes wher-in she was clad. But natheles this mayde bright of hewe Fro foot to heed they clothed han al newe. Hir heres han they kembd, that lay untressed Ful rudely, and with hir fingres smale A corone on hir heed they han y-dressed, And sette hir ful of nowches grete and smale; Of hir array what sholde I make a tale? Unnethe the peple hir knew for hir fairnesse, Whan she translated was in swich richesse. This markis hath hir spoused with a ring Broght for the same cause, and than hir sette Up-on an hors, snow-whyt and wel ambling, And to his paleys, er he lenger lette, With Ioyful peple that hir ladde and mette, Conveyed hir, and thus the day they spende In revel, til the sonne gan descende. And shortly forth this tale for to chace, I seye that to this newe markisesse God hath swich favour sent hir of his grace, That it ne semed nat by lyklinesse That she was born and fed in rudenesse, As in a cote or in an oxe-stalle, But norished in an emperoures halle. To every wight she woxen is so dere And worshipful, that folk ther she was bore And from hir birthe knewe hir yeer by yere, Unnethe trowed they, but dorste han swore That to Ianicle, of which I spak bifore, She doghter nas, for, as by coniecture, Hem thoughte she was another creature. For thogh that ever vertuous was she, She was encressed in swich excellence Of thewes gode, y-set in heigh bountee, And so discreet and fair of eloquence, So benigne and so digne of reverence, And coude so the peples herte embrace, That ech hir lovede that loked on hir face. Noght only of Saluces in the toun Publiced was the bountee of hir name, But eek bisyde in many a regioun, If oon seyde wel, another seyde the same; So spradde of hir heigh bountee the fame, That men and wommen, as wel yonge as olde, Gon to Saluce, upon hir to biholde. Thus Walter lowly, nay but royally, Wedded with fortunat honestetee, In goddes pees liveth ful esily At hoom, and outward grace y-nogh had he; And for he saugh that under low degree Was ofte vertu hid, the peple him helde A prudent man, and that is seyn ful selde. Nat only this Grisildis thurgh hir wit Coude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse, But eek, whan that the cas requyred it, The commune profit coude she redresse. Ther nas discord, rancour, ne hevinesse In al that lond, that she ne coude apese, And wysly bringe hem alle in reste and ese. Though that hir housbonde absent were anoon, If gentil men, or othere of hir contree Were wrothe, she wolde bringen hem atoon; So wyse and rype wordes hadde she, And Iugements of so greet equitee, That she from heven sent was, as men wende, Peple to save and every wrong tamende. Nat longe tyme after that this Grisild Was wedded, she a doughter hath y-bore, Al had hir lever have born a knave child. Glad was this markis and the folk therfore; For though a mayde child come al bifore, She may unto a knave child atteyne By lyklihed, sin she nis nat bareyne. Explicit secunda pars. Incipit tercia pars. [Pars Tertia.] Ther fil, as it bifalleth tymes mo, Whan that this child had souked but a throwe, This markis in his herte longeth so To tempte his wyf, hir sadnesse for to knowe, That he ne mighte out of his herte throwe This merveillous desyr, his wyf tassaye, Needless, god woot, he thoughte hir for taffraye. He hadde assayed hir y-nogh bifore, And fond hir ever good; what neded it Hir for to tempte and alwey more and more? Though som men preise it for a subtil wit, But as for me, I seye that yvel it sit Tassaye a wyf whan that it is no nede, And putten her in anguish and in drede. For which this markis wroghte in this manere; He cam alone a-night, ther as she lay, With sterne face and with ful trouble chere, And seyde thus, ‘Grisild,’ quod he, ‘that day That I yow took out of your povre array, And putte yow in estaat of heigh noblesse, Ye have nat that forgeten, as I gesse. I seye, Grisild, this present dignitee, In which that I have put yow, as I trowe, Maketh yow nat foryetful for to be That I yow took in povre estaat ful lowe For any wele ye moot your-selven knowe. Tak hede of every word that I yow seye, Ther is no wight that hereth it but we tweye. Ye woot your-self wel, how that ye cam here In-to this hous, it is nat longe ago, And though to me that ye be lief and dere, Un-to my gentils ye be no-thing so; They seyn, to hem it is greet shame and wo For to be subgets and ben in servage To thee, that born art of a smal village. And namely, sith thy doghter was y-bore, Thise wordes han they spoken doutelees; But I desyre, as I have doon bifore, To live my lyf with hem in reste and pees; I may nat in this caas be recchelees. I moot don with thy doghter for the beste, Nat as I wolde, but as my peple leste. And yet, god wot, this is ful looth to me; But nathelees with-oute your witing I wol nat doon, but this wol I,’ quod he, ‘That ye to me assente as in this thing. Shewe now your pacience in your werking That ye me highte and swore in your village That day that maked was our mariage.’ Whan she had herd al this, she noght ameved Neither in word, or chere, or countenaunce; For, as it semed, she was nat agreved: She seyde, ‘lord, al lyth in your plesaunce, My child and I with hertly obeisaunce Ben youres al, and ye mowe save or spille Your owene thing; werketh after your wille. Ther may no-thing, god so my soule save, Lyken to yow that may displese me; Ne I desyre no-thing for to have, Ne drede for to lese, save only ye; This wil is in myn herte and ay shal be. No lengthe of tyme or deeth may this deface, Ne chaunge my corage to another place.’ Glad was this markis of hir answering, But yet he feyned as he were nat so; Al drery was his chere and his loking Whan that he sholde out of the chambre go. Sone after this, a furlong wey or two, He prively hath told al his entente Un-to a man, and to his wyf him sente. A maner sergeant was this privee man, The which that feithful ofte he founden hadde In thinges grete, and eek swich folk wel can Don execucioun on thinges badde. The lord knew wel that he him loved and dradde; And whan this sergeant wiste his lordes wille, In-to the chambre he stalked him ful stille. ‘Madame,’ he seyde, ‘ye mote foryeve it me, Thogh I do thing to which I am constreyned; Ye ben so wys that ful wel knowe ye That lordes hestes mowe nat been y-feyned; They mowe wel been biwailled or compleyned, But men mot nede un-to her lust obeye, And so wol I; ther is na-more to seye. This child I am comanded for to take’— And spak na-more, but out the child he hente Despitously, and gan a chere make As though he wolde han slayn it er he wente. Grisildis mot al suffren and consente; And as a lamb she sitteth meke and stille, And leet this cruel sergeant doon his wille. Suspecious was the diffame of this man, Suspect his face, suspect his word also; Suspect the tyme in which he this bigan. Allas! hir doghter that she lovede so She wende he wolde han slawen it right tho. But natheles she neither weep ne syked, Consenting hir to that the markis lyked. But atte laste speken she bigan, And mekely she to the sergeant preyde, So as he was a worthy gentil man, That she moste kisse hir child er that it deyde; And in her barm this litel child she leyde With ful sad face, and gan the child to kisse And lulled it, and after gan it blisse. And thus she seyde in hir benigne voys, ‘Far weel, my child; I shal thee never see; But, sith I thee have marked with the croys, Of thilke fader blessed mote thou be, That for us deyde up-on a croys of tree. Thy soule, litel child, I him bitake, For this night shaltow dyen for my sake.’ I trowe that to a norice in this cas It had ben hard this rewthe for to se; Wel mighte a mooder than han cryed ‘allas!’ But nathelees so sad stedfast was she, That she endured all adversitee, And to the sergeant mekely she sayde, ‘Have heer agayn your litel yonge mayde. Goth now,’ quod she, ‘and dooth my lordes heste, But o thing wol I preye yow of your grace, That, but my lord forbad yow, atte leste Burieth this litel body in som place That bestes ne no briddes it to-race.’ But he no word wol to that purpos seye, But took the child and wente upon his weye. This sergeant cam un-to his lord ageyn, And of Grisildis wordes and hir chere He tolde him point for point, in short and playn, And him presenteth with his doghter dere. Somwhat this lord hath rewthe in his manere; But nathelees his purpos heeld he stille, As lordes doon, whan they wol han hir wille; And bad his sergeant that he prively Sholde this child ful softe winde and wrappe With alle circumstances tendrely, And carie it in a cofre or in a lappe; But, up-on peyne his heed of for to swappe, That no man sholde knowe of his entente, Ne whenne he cam, ne whider that he wente; But at Boloigne to his suster dere, That thilke tyme of Panik was countesse, He sholde it take, and shewe hir this matere, Bisekinge hir to don hir bisinesse This child to fostre in alle gentilesse; And whos child that it was he bad hir hyde From every wight, for oght that may bityde. The sergeant gooth, and hath fulfild this thing; But to this markis now retourne we; For now goth he ful faste imagining If by his wyves chere he mighte see, Or by hir word aperceyve that she Were chaunged; but he never hir coude finde But ever in oon y-lyke sad and kinde. As glad, as humble, as bisy in servyse, And eek in love as she was wont to be, Was she to him in every maner wyse; Ne of hir doghter noght a word spak she. Non accident for noon adversitee Was seyn in hir, ne never hir doghter name Ne nempned she, in ernest nor in game. Explicit tercia pars. Sequitur pars quarta. [Pars Quarta.] In this estaat ther passed been foure yeer Er she with childe was; but, as god wolde, A knave child she bar by this Walter, Ful gracious and fair for to biholde. And whan that folk it to his fader tolde, Nat only he, but al his contree, merie Was for this child, and god they thanke and herie. Whan it was two yeer old, and fro the brest Departed of his norice, on a day This markis caughte yet another lest To tempte his wyf yet ofter, if he may. O needles was she tempted in assay! But wedded men ne knowe no mesure, Whan that they finde a pacient creature. ‘Wyf,’ quod this markis, ‘ye han herd er this, My peple sikly berth our mariage, And namely, sith my sone y-boren is, Now is it worse than ever in al our age. The murmur sleeth myn herte and my corage; For to myne eres comth the voys so smerte, That it wel ny destroyed hath myn herte. Now sey they thus, “whan Walter is agoon, Then shal the blood of Ianicle succede And been our lord, for other have we noon;” Swiche wordes seith my peple, out of drede. Wel oughte I of swich murmur taken hede; For certeinly I drede swich sentence, Though they nat pleyn speke in myn audience. I wolde live in pees, if that I mighte; Wherfor I am disposed outerly, As I his suster servede by nighte, Right so thenke I to serve him prively; This warne I yow, that ye nat sodeynly Out of your-self for no wo sholde outraye; Beth pacient, and ther-of I yow preye.’ ‘I have,’ quod she, ‘seyd thus, and ever shal, I wol no thing, ne nil no thing, certayn, But as yow list; noght greveth me at al, Thogh that my doghter and my sone be slayn, At your comandement, this is to sayn. I have noght had no part of children tweyne But first siknesse, and after wo and peyne. Ye been our lord, doth with your owene thing Right as yow list; axeth no reed at me. For, as I lefte at hoom al my clothing, Whan I first cam to yow, right so,’ quod she, ‘Left I my wil and al my libertee, And took your clothing; wherfor I yow preye, Doth your plesaunce, I wol your lust obeye. And certes, if I hadde prescience Your wil to knowe er ye your lust me tolde, I wolde it doon with-outen necligence; But now I woot your lust and what ye wolde, Al your plesaunce ferme and stable I holde; For wiste I that my deeth wolde do yow ese, Right gladly wolde I dyen, yow to plese. Deth may noght make no comparisoun Un-to your love:’ and, whan this markis sey The constance of his wyf, he caste adoun His yën two, and wondreth that she may In pacience suffre al this array. And forth he gooth with drery contenaunce, But to his herte it was ful greet plesaunce. This ugly sergeant, in the same wyse That he hir doghter caughte, right so he, Or worse, if men worse can devyse, Hath hent hir sone, that ful was of beautee. And ever in oon so pacient was she, That she no chere made of hevinesse, But kiste hir sone, and after gan it blesse; Save this; she preyed him that, if he mighte, Hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave, His tendre limes, delicat to sighte, Fro foules and fro bestes for to save. But she non answer of him mighte have. He wente his wey, as him no-thing ne roghte; But to Boloigne he tendrely it broghte. This markis wondreth ever lenger the more Up-on hir pacience, and if that he Ne hadde soothly knowen ther-bifore, That parfitly hir children lovede she, He wolde have wend that of som subtiltee, And of malice or for cruel corage, That she had suffred this with sad visage. But wel he knew that next him-self, certayn, She loved hir children best in every wyse. But now of wommen wolde I axen fayn, If thise assayes mighte nat suffyse? What coude a sturdy housbond more devyse To preve hir wyfhod and hir stedfastnesse, And he continuing ever in sturdinesse? But ther ben folk of swich condicioun, That, whan they have a certein purpos take, They can nat stinte of hir entencioun, But, right as they were bounden to a stake, They wol nat of that firste purpos slake. Right so this markis fulliche hath purposed To tempte his wyf, as he was first disposed. He waiteth, if by word or contenance That she to him was changed of corage; But never coude he finde variance; She was ay oon in herte and in visage; And ay the forther that she was in age, The more trewe, if that it were possible, She was to him in love, and more penible. For which it semed thus, that of hem two Ther nas but o wil; for, as Walter leste, The same lust was hir plesance also, And, god be thanked, al fil for the beste. She shewed wel, for no worldly unreste A wyf, as of hir-self, no-thing ne sholde Wille in effect, but as hir housbond wolde. The sclaundre of Walter ofte and wyde spradde, That of a cruel herte he wikkedly, For he a povre womman wedded hadde, Hath mordred bothe his children prively. Swich murmur was among hem comunly. No wonder is, for to the peples ere Ther cam no word but that they mordred were. For which, wher-as his peple ther-bifore Had loved him wel, the sclaundre of his diffame Made hem that they him hatede therfore; To been a mordrer is an hateful name. But natheles, for ernest ne for game He of his cruel purpos nolde stente; To tempte his wyf was set al his entente. Whan that his doghter twelf yeer was of age, He to the court of Rome, in subtil wyse Enformed of his wil, sente his message, Comaunding hem swiche bulles to devyse As to his cruel purpos may suffyse, How that the pope, as for his peples reste, Bad him to wedde another, if him leste. I seye, he bad they sholde countrefete The popes bulles, making mencioun That he hath leve his firste wyf to lete, As by the popes dispensacioun, To stinte rancour and dissencioun Bitwixe his peple and him; thus seyde the bulle, The which they han publiced atte fulle. The rude peple, as it no wonder is, Wenden ful wel that it had been right so; But whan thise tydinges cam to Grisildis, I deme that hir herte was ful wo. But she, y-lyke sad for evermo, Disposed was, this humble creature, Thadversitee of fortune al tendure. Abyding ever his lust and his plesaunce, To whom that she was yeven, herte and al, As to hir verray worldly suffisaunce; But shortly if this storie I tellen shal, This markis writen hath in special A lettre in which he sheweth his entente, And secrely he to Boloigne it sente. To the erl of Panik, which that hadde tho Wedded his suster, preyde he specially To bringen hoom agayn his children two In honurable estaat al openly. But o thing he him preyede outerly, That he to no wight, though men wolde enquere, Sholde nat telle, whos children that they were, But seye, the mayden sholde y-wedded be Un-to the markis of Saluce anon. And as this erl was preyed, so dide he; For at day set he on his wey is goon Toward Saluce, and lordes many oon, In riche array, this mayden for to gyde; Hir yonge brother ryding hir bisyde. Arrayed was toward hir mariage This fresshe mayde, ful of gemmes clere; Hir brother, which that seven yeer was of age, Arrayed eek ful fresh in his manere. And thus in greet noblesse and with glad chere, Toward Saluces shaping hir Iourney, Fro day to day they ryden in hir wey. Explicit quarta pars. Sequitur quinta pars. [Pars Quinta.] Among al this, after his wikke usage, This markis, yet his wyf to tempte more To the uttereste preve of hir corage, Fully to han experience and lore If that she were as stedfast as bifore, He on a day in open audience Ful boistously hath seyd hir this sentence: ‘Certes, Grisilde, I hadde y-nough plesaunce To han yow to my wyf for your goodnesse, As for your trouthe and for your obeisaunce, Nought for your linage ne for your richesse; But now knowe I in verray soothfastnesse That in gret lordshipe, if I wel avyse, Ther is gret servitute in sondry wyse. I may nat don as every plowman may; My peple me constreyneth for to take Another wyf, and cryen day by day; And eek the pope, rancour for to slake, Consenteth it, that dar I undertake; And treweliche thus muche I wol yow seye, My newe wyf is coming by the weye. Be strong of herte, and voyde anon hir place, And thilke dower that ye broghten me Tak it agayn, I graunte it of my grace; Retourneth to your fadres hous,’ quod he; ‘No man may alwey han prosperitee; With evene herte I rede yow tendure The strook of fortune or of aventure.’ And she answerde agayn in pacience, ‘My lord,’ quod she, ‘I woot, and wiste alway How that bitwixen your magnificence And my poverte no wight can ne may Maken comparison; it is no nay. I ne heeld me never digne in no manere To be your wyf, no, ne your chamberere. And in this hous, ther ye me lady made— The heighe god take I for my witnesse, And also wisly he my soule glade— I never heeld me lady ne maistresse, But humble servant to your worthinesse, And ever shal, whyl that my lyf may dure, Aboven every worldly creature. That ye so longe of your benignitee Han holden me in honour and nobleye, Wher-as I was noght worthy for to be, That thonke I god and yow, to whom I preye Foryelde it yow; there is na-more to seye. Un-to my fader gladly wol I wende, And with him dwelle un-to my lyves ende. Ther I was fostred of a child ful smal, Til I be deed, my lyf ther wol I lede A widwe clene, in body, herte, and al. For sith I yaf to yow my maydenhede, And am your trewe wyf, it is no drede, God shilde swich a lordes wyf to take Another man to housbonde or to make. And of your newe wyf, god of his grace So graunte yow wele and prosperitee: For I wol gladly yelden hir my place, In which that I was blisful wont to be, For sith it lyketh yow, my lord,’ quod she, ‘That whylom weren al myn hertes reste, That I shal goon, I wol gon whan yow leste. But ther-as ye me profre swich dowaire As I first broghte, it is wel in my minde It were my wrecched clothes, no-thing faire, The which to me were hard now for to finde. O gode god! how gentil and how kinde Ye semed by your speche and your visage The day that maked was our mariage! But sooth is seyd, algate I finde it trewe— For in effect it preved is on me— Love is noght old as whan that it is newe. But certes, lord, for noon adversitee, To dyen in the cas, it shal nat be That ever in word or werk I shal repente That I yow yaf myn herte in hool entente. My lord, ye woot that, in my fadres place, Ye dede me strepe out of my povre wede, And richely me cladden, of your grace. To yow broghte I noght elles, out of drede, But feyth and nakednesse and maydenhede. And here agayn my clothing I restore, And eek my wedding-ring, for evermore. The remenant of your Iewels redy be In-with your chambre, dar I saufly sayn; Naked out of my fadres hous,’ quod she, ‘I cam, and naked moot I turne agayn. Al your plesaunce wol I folwen fayn; But yet I hope it be nat your entente That I smoklees out of your paleys wente. Ye coude nat doon so dishoneste a thing, That thilke wombe in which your children leye Sholde, biforn the peple, in my walking, Be seyn al bare; wherfor I yow preye, Lat me nat lyk a worm go by the weye. Remembre yow, myn owene lord so dere, I was your wyf, thogh I unworthy were. Wherfor, in guerdon of my maydenhede, Which that I broghte, and noght agayn I bere, As voucheth sauf to yeve me, to my mede, But swich a smok as I was wont to were, That I therwith may wrye the wombe of here That was your wyf; and heer take I my leve Of yow, myn owene lord, lest I yow greve.’ ‘The smok,’ quod he, ‘that thou hast on thy bak, Lat it be stille, and ber it forth with thee.’ But wel unnethes thilke word he spak, But wente his wey for rewthe and for pitee. Biforn the folk hir-selven strepeth she, And in hir smok, with heed and foot al bare, Toward hir fader hous forth is she fare. The folk hir folwe wepinge in hir weye, And fortune ay they cursen as they goon; But she fro weping kepte hir yën dreye, Ne in this tyme word ne spak she noon. Hir fader, that this tyding herde anoon, Curseth the day and tyme that nature Shoop him to been a lyves creature. For out of doute this olde povre man Was ever in suspect of hir mariage; For ever he demed, sith that it bigan, That whan the lord fulfild had his corage, Him wolde thinke it were a disparage To his estaat so lowe for talighte, And voyden hir as sone as ever he mighte. Agayns his doghter hastilich goth he, For he by noyse of folk knew hir cominge, And with hir olde cote, as it mighte be, He covered hir, ful sorwefully wepinge; But on hir body mighte he it nat bringe. For rude was the cloth, and more of age By dayes fele than at hir mariage. Thus with hir fader, for a certeyn space, Dwelleth this flour of wyfly pacience, That neither by hir wordes ne hir face Biforn the folk, ne eek in hir absence, Ne shewed she that hir was doon offence; Ne of hir heigh estaat no remembraunce Ne hadde she, as by hir countenaunce. No wonder is, for in hir grete estaat Hir goost was ever in pleyn humylitee; No tendre mouth, non herte delicaat, No pompe, no semblant of royaltee, But ful of pacient benignitee, Discreet and prydeles, ay honurable, And to hir housbonde ever meke and stable. Men speke of Iob and most for his humblesse, As clerkes, whan hem list, can wel endyte, Namely of men, but as in soothfastnesse, Thogh clerkes preyse wommen but a lyte, Ther can no man in humblesse him acquyte As womman can, ne can ben half so trewe As wommen been, but it be falle of-newe. [Pars Sexta.] Fro Boloigne is this erl of Panik come, Of which the fame up-sprang to more and lesse, And in the peples eres alle and some Was couth eek, that a newe markisesse He with him broghte, in swich pompe and richesse, That never was ther seyn with mannes yë So noble array in al West Lumbardye. The markis, which that shoop and knew al this, Er that this erl was come, sente his message For thilke sely povre Grisildis; And she with humble herte and glad visage, Nat with no swollen thoght in hir corage, Cam at his heste, and on hir knees hir sette, And reverently and wysly she him grette. ‘Grisild,’ quod he, ‘my wille is outerly, This mayden, that shal wedded been to me, Receyved be to-morwe as royally As it possible is in myn hous to be. And eek that every wight in his degree Have his estaat in sitting and servyse And heigh plesaunce, as I can best devyse. I have no wommen suffisaunt certayn The chambres for tarraye in ordinaunce After my lust, and therfor wolde I fayn That thyn were al swich maner governaunce; Thou knowest eek of old al my plesaunce; Though thyn array be badde and yvel biseye, Do thou thy devoir at the leeste weye.’ ‘Nat only, lord, that I am glad,’ quod she, ‘To doon your lust, but I desyre also Yow for to serve and plese in my degree With-outen feynting, and shal evermo. Ne never, for no wele ne no wo, Ne shal the gost with-in myn herte stente To love yow best with al my trewe entente.’ And with that word she gan the hous to dighte, And tables for to sette and beddes make; And peyned hir to doon al that she mighte, Preying the chambereres, for goddes sake, To hasten hem, and faste swepe and shake; And she, the moste servisable of alle, Hath every chambre arrayed and his halle. Abouten undern gan this erl alighte, That with him broghte thise noble children tweye, For which the peple ran to seen the sighte Of hir array, so richely biseye; And than at erst amonges hem they seye, That Walter was no fool, thogh that him leste To chaunge his wyf, for it was for the beste. For she is fairer, as they demen alle, Than is Grisild, and more tendre of age, And fairer fruit bitwene hem sholde falle, And more plesant, for hir heigh linage; Hir brother eek so fair was of visage, That hem to seen the peple hath caught plesaunce, Commending now the markis governaunce.— Auctor. ‘O stormy peple! unsad and ever untrewe! Ay undiscreet and chaunging as a vane, Delyting ever in rumbel that is newe, For lyk the mone ay wexe ye and wane; Ay ful of clapping, dere y-nogh a Iane; Your doom is fals, your constance yvel preveth, A ful greet fool is he that on yow leveth!’ Thus seyden sadde folk in that citee, Whan that the peple gazed up and doun, For they were glad, right for the noveltee, To han a newe lady of hir toun. Na-more of this make I now mencioun; But to Grisilde agayn wol I me dresse, And telle hir constance and hir bisinesse.— Ful bisy was Grisilde in every thing That to the feste was apertinent; Right noght was she abayst of hir clothing, Though it were rude and somdel eek to-rent. But with glad chere to the yate is went, With other folk, to grete the markisesse, And after that doth forth hir bisinesse. With so glad chere his gestes she receyveth, And conningly, everich in his degree, That no defaute no man aperceyveth; But ay they wondren what she mighte be That in so povre array was for to see, And coude swich honour and reverence; And worthily they preisen hir prudence. In al this mene whyle she ne stente This mayde and eek hir brother to commende With al hir herte, in ful benigne entente, So wel, that no man coude hir prys amende. But atte laste, whan that thise lordes wende To sitten doun to mete, he gan to calle Grisilde, as she was bisy in his halle. ‘Grisilde,’ quod he, as it were in his pley, ‘How lyketh thee my wyf and hir beautee?’ ‘Right wel,’ quod she, ‘my lord; for, in good fey, A fairer say I never noon than she. I prey to god yeve hir prosperitee; And so hope I that he wol to yow sende Plesance y-nogh un-to your lyves ende. O thing biseke I yow and warne also, That ye ne prikke with no tormentinge This tendre mayden, as ye han don mo; For she is fostred in hir norishinge More tendrely, and, to my supposinge, She coude nat adversitee endure As coude a povre fostred creature.’ And whan this Walter say hir pacience, Hir glade chere and no malice at al, And he so ofte had doon to hir offence, And she ay sad and constant as a wal, Continuing ever hir innocence overal, This sturdy markis gan his herte dresse To rewen up-on hir wyfly stedfastnesse. ‘This is y-nogh, Grisilde myn,’ quod he, ‘Be now na-more agast ne yvel apayed; I have thy feith and thy benignitee, As wel as ever womman was, assayed, In greet estaat, and povreliche arrayed. Now knowe I, dere wyf, thy stedfastnesse,’— And hir in armes took and gan hir kesse. And she for wonder took of it no keep; She herde nat what thing he to hir seyde; She ferde as she had stert out of a sleep, Til she out of hir masednesse abreyde. ‘Grisilde,’ quod he, ‘by god that for us deyde, Thou art my wyf, ne noon other I have, Ne never hadde, as god my soule save! This is thy doghter which thou hast supposed To be my wyf; that other feithfully Shal be myn heir, as I have ay purposed; Thou bare him in thy body trewely. At Boloigne have I kept hem prively; Tak hem agayn, for now maystow nat seye That thou hast lorn non of thy children tweye. And folk that otherweyes han seyd of me, I warne hem wel that I have doon this dede For no malice ne for no crueltee, But for tassaye in thee thy wommanhede, And nat to sleen my children, god forbede! But for to kepe hem prively and stille, Til I thy purpos knewe and al thy wille.’ Whan she this herde, aswowne doun she falleth For pitous Ioye, and after hir swowninge She bothe hir yonge children un-to hir calleth, And in hir armes, pitously wepinge, Embraceth hem, and tendrely kissinge Ful lyk a mooder, with hir salte teres She batheth bothe hir visage and hir heres. O, which a pitous thing it was to see Hir swowning, and hir humble voys to here! ‘Grauntmercy, lord, that thanke I yow,’ quod she, ‘That ye han saved me my children dere! Now rekke I never to ben deed right here; Sith I stonde in your love and in your grace, No fors of deeth, ne whan my spirit pace! O tendre, o dere, o yonge children myne, Your woful mooder wende stedfastly That cruel houndes or som foul vermyne Hadde eten yow; but god, of his mercy, And your benigne fader tendrely Hath doon yow kept;’ and in that same stounde Al sodeynly she swapte adoun to grounde. And in her swough so sadly holdeth she Hir children two, whan she gan hem tembrace, That with greet sleighte and greet difficultee The children from hir arm they gonne arace. O many a teer on many a pitous face Doun ran of hem that stoden hir bisyde; Unnethe abouten hir mighte they abyde. Walter hir gladeth, and hir sorwe slaketh; She ryseth up, abaysed, from hir traunce, And every wight hir Ioye and feste maketh, Til she hath caught agayn hir contenaunce. Walter hir dooth so feithfully plesaunce, That it was deyntee for to seen the chere Bitwixe hem two, now they ben met y-fere. Thise ladyes, whan that they hir tyme say, Han taken hir, and in-to chambre goon, And strepen hir out of hir rude array, And in a cloth of gold that brighte shoon, With a coroune of many a riche stoon Up-on hir heed, they in-to halle hir broghte, And ther she was honoured as hir oghte. Thus hath this pitous day a blisful ende, For every man and womman dooth his might This day in murthe and revel to dispende Til on the welkne shoon the sterres light. For more solempne in every mannes sight This feste was, and gretter of costage, Than was the revel of hir mariage. Ful many a yeer in heigh prosperitee Liven thise two in concord and in reste, And richely his doghter maried he Un-to a lord, oon of the worthieste Of al Itaille; and than in pees and reste His wyves fader in his court he kepeth, Til that the soule out of his body crepeth. His sone succedeth in his heritage In reste and pees, after his fader day; And fortunat was eek in mariage, Al putte he nat his wyf in greet assay. This world is nat so strong, it is no nay, As it hath been in olde tymes yore, And herkneth what this auctour seith therfore. This storie is seyd, nat for that wyves sholde Folwen Grisilde as in humilitee, For it were importable, though they wolde; But for that every wight, in his degree, Sholde be constant in adversitee As was Grisilde; therfor Petrark wryteth This storie, which with heigh style he endyteth. For, sith a womman was so pacient Un-to a mortal man, wel more us oghte Receyven al in gree that god us sent; For greet skile is, he preve that he wroghte. But he ne tempteth no man that he boghte, As seith seint Iame, if ye his pistel rede; He preveth folk al day, it is no drede, And suffreth us, as for our excercyse, With sharpe scourges of adversitee Ful ofte to be bete in sondry wyse; Nat for to knowe our wil, for certes he, Er we were born, knew al our freletee; And for our beste is al his governaunce; Lat us than live in vertuous suffraunce. But o word, lordinges, herkneth er I go:— It were ful hard to finde now a dayes In al a toun Grisildes three or two; For, if that they were put to swiche assayes, The gold of hem hath now so badde alayes With bras, that thogh the coyne be fair at yë, It wolde rather breste a-two than plye. For which heer, for the wyves love of Bathe, Whos lyf and al hir secte god mayntene In heigh maistrye, and elles were it scathe, I wol with lusty herte fresshe and grene Seyn yow a song to glade yow, I wene, And lat us stinte of ernestful matere:— Herkneth my song, that seith in this manere. Lenvoy de Chaucer. Grisilde is deed, and eek hir pacience, And bothe atones buried in Itaille; For which I crye in open audience, No wedded man so hardy be tassaille His wyves pacience, in hope to finde Grisildes, for in certein he shall faille! O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence, Lat noon humilitee your tonge naille, Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence To wryte of yow a storie of swich mervaille As of Grisildis pacient and kinde; Lest Chichevache yow swelwe in hir entraille! Folweth Ekko, that holdeth no silence, But evere answereth at the countretaille; Beth nat bidaffed for your innocence, But sharply tak on yow the governaille. Emprinteth wel this lesson in your minde For commune profit, sith it may availle. Ye archewyves, stondeth at defence, Sin ye be stronge as is a greet camaille; Ne suffreth nat that men yow doon offence. And sclendre wyves, feble as in bataille, Beth egre as is a tygre yond in Inde; Ay clappeth as a mille, I yow consaille. Ne dreed hem nat, do hem no reverence; For though thyn housbonde armed be in maille, The arwes of thy crabbed eloquence Shal perce his brest, and eek his aventaille; In Ialousye I rede eek thou him binde, And thou shalt make him couche as dooth a quaille. If thou be fair, ther folk ben in presence Shew thou thy visage and thyn apparaille; If thou be foul, be free of thy dispence, To gete thee freendes ay do thy travaille; Be ay of chere as light as leef on linde, And lat him care, and wepe, and wringe, and waille! Here endeth the Clerk of Oxonford his Tale. THE MERCHANT'S PROLOGUE. The Prologe of the Marchantes Tale. ‘Weping and wayling, care, and other sorwe I know y-nogh, on even and a-morwe,’ Quod the Marchaunt, ‘and so don othere mo That wedded been, I trowe that it be so. For, wel I woot, it fareth so with me. I have a wyf, the worste that may be; For thogh the feend to hir y-coupled were, She wolde him overmacche, I dar wel swere. What sholde I yow reherce in special Hir hye malice? she is a shrewe at al. Ther is a long and large difference Bitwix Grisildis grete pacience And of my wyf the passing crueltee. Were I unbounden, al-so moot I thee! I wolde never eft comen in the snare. We wedded men live in sorwe and care; Assaye who-so wol, and he shal finde I seye sooth, by seint Thomas of Inde, As for the more part, I sey nat alle. God shilde that it sholde so bifalle! A! good sir hoost! I have y-wedded be Thise monthes two, and more nat, pardee; And yet, I trowe, he that all his lyve Wyflees hath been, though that men wolde him ryve Un-to the herte, ne coude in no manere Tellen so muchel sorwe, as I now here Coude tellen of my wyves cursednesse!’ ‘Now,’ quod our hoost, ‘Marchaunt, so god yow blesse, Sin ye so muchel knowen of that art, Ful hertely I pray yow telle us part.’ ‘Gladly,’ quod he, ‘but of myn owene sore, For sory herte, I telle may na-more.’ THE MARCHANTES TALE. Here biginneth the Marchantes Tale. Whylom ther was dwellinge in Lumbardye A worthy knight, that born was of Pavye, In which he lived in greet prosperitee; And sixty yeer a wyflees man was he, And folwed ay his bodily delyt On wommen, ther-as was his appetyt, As doon thise foles that ben seculeer. And whan that he was passed sixty yeer, Were it for holinesse or for dotage, I can nat seye, but swich a greet corage Hadde this knight to been a wedded man, That day and night he dooth al that he can Tespyen where he mighte wedded be; Preyinge our lord to granten him, that he Mighte ones knowe of thilke blisful lyf That is bitwixe an housbond and his wyf; And for to live under that holy bond With which that first god man and womman bond. ‘Non other lyf,’ seyde he, ‘is worth a bene; For wedlok is so esy and so clene, That in this world it is a paradys.’ Thus seyde this olde knight, that was so wys. And certeinly, as sooth as god is king, To take a wyf, it is a glorious thing, And namely whan a man is old and hoor; Thanne is a wyf the fruit of his tresor. Than sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir, On which he mighte engendren him an heir, And lede his lyf in Ioye and in solas, Wher-as thise bacheleres singe ‘allas,’ Whan that they finden any adversitee In love, which nis but childish vanitee. And trewely it sit wel to be so, That bacheleres have often peyne and wo; On brotel ground they builde, and brotelnesse They finde, whan they wene sikernesse. They live but as a brid or as a beste, In libertee, and under non areste, Ther-as a wedded man in his estaat Liveth a lyf blisful and ordinaat, Under the yok of mariage y-bounde; Wel may his herte in Ioye and blisse habounde. For who can be so buxom as a wyf? Who is so trewe, and eek so ententyf To kepe him, syk and hool, as is his make? For wele or wo, she wol him nat forsake. She nis nat wery him to love and serve, Thogh that he lye bedrede til he sterve. And yet somme clerkes seyn, it nis nat so, Of whiche he, Theofraste, is oon of tho. What force though Theofraste liste lye? ‘Ne take no wyf,’ quod he, ‘for housbondrye, As for to spare in houshold thy dispence; A trewe servant dooth more diligence, Thy good to kepe, than thyn owene wyf. For she wol clayme half part al hir lyf; And if that thou be syk, so god me save, Thy verray frendes or a trewe knave Wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay After thy good, and hath don many a day.’ And if thou take a wyf un-to thyn hold, Ful lightly maystow been a cokewold. This sentence, and an hundred thinges worse, Wryteth this man, ther god his bones corse! But take no kepe of al swich vanitee; Deffye Theofraste and herke me. A wyf is goddes yifte verraily; Alle other maner yiftes hardily, As londes, rentes, pasture, or commune, Or moebles, alle ben yiftes of fortune, That passen as a shadwe upon a wal. But dredelees, if pleynly speke I shal, A wyf wol laste, and in thyn hous endure, Wel lenger than thee list, paraventure. Mariage is a ful gret sacrement; He which that hath no wyf, I holde him shent; He liveth helplees and al desolat, I speke of folk in seculer estaat. And herke why, I sey nat this for noght, That womman is for mannes help y-wroght. The hye god, whan he hadde Adam maked, And saugh him al allone, bely-naked, God of his grete goodnesse seyde than, ‘Lat us now make an help un-to this man Lyk to him-self;’ and thanne he made him Eve. Heer may ye se, and heer-by may ye preve, That wyf is mannes help and his confort, His paradys terrestre and his disport. So buxom and so vertuous is she, They moste nedes live in unitee. O flesh they been, and o flesh, as I gesse, Hath but on herte, in wele and in distresse. A wyf! a! Seinte Marie, benedicite! How mighte a man han any adversitee That hath a wyf? certes, I can nat seye. The blisse which that is bitwixe hem tweye Ther may no tonge telle, or herte thinke. If he be povre, she helpeth him to swinke; She kepeth his good, and wasteth never a deel; Al that hir housbonde lust, hir lyketh weel; She seith not ones ‘nay,’ whan he seith ‘ye.’ ‘Do this,’ seith he; ‘al redy, sir,’ seith she. O blisful ordre of wedlok precious, Thou art so mery, and eek so vertuous, And so commended and appreved eek, That every man that halt him worth a leek, Up-on his bare knees oghte al his lyf Thanken his god that him hath sent a wyf; Or elles preye to god him for to sende A wyf, to laste un-to his lyves ende. For thanne his lyf is set in sikernesse; He may nat be deceyved, as I gesse, So that he werke after his wyves reed; Than may he boldly beren up his heed, They been so trewe and ther-with-al so wyse; For which, if thou wolt werken as the wyse, Do alwey so as wommen wol thee rede. Lo, how that Iacob, as thise clerkes rede, By good conseil of his moder Rebekke, Bond the kides skin aboute his nekke; Thurgh which his fadres benisoun he wan. Lo, Iudith, as the storie eek telle can, By wys conseil she goddes peple kepte, And slow him, Olofernus, whyl he slepte. Lo Abigayl, by good conseil how she Saved hir housbond Nabal, whan that he Sholde han be slayn; and loke, Ester also By good conseil delivered out of wo The peple of god, and made him, Mardochee, Of Assuere enhaunced for to be. Ther nis no-thing in gree superlatyf, As seith Senek, above an humble wyf. Suffre thy wyves tonge, as Caton bit; She shal comande, and thou shalt suffren it; And yet she wol obeye of curteisye. A wyf is keper of thyn housbondrye; Wel may the syke man biwaille and wepe, Ther-as ther nis no wyf the hous to kepe. I warne thee, if wysly thou wolt wirche, Love wel thy wyf, as Crist loveth his chirche. If thou lovest thy-self, thou lovest thy wyf; No man hateth his flesh, but in his lyf He fostreth it, and therfore bidde I thee, Cherisse thy wyf, or thou shalt never thee. Housbond and wyf, what so men Iape or pleye, Of worldly folk holden the siker weye; They been so knit, ther may noon harm bityde; And namely, up-on the wyves syde. For which this Ianuarie, of whom I tolde, Considered hath, inwith his dayes olde, The lusty lyf, the vertuous quiete, That is in mariage hony-swete; And for his freendes on a day he sente, To tellen hem theffect of his entente. With face sad, his tale he hath hem told; He seyde, ‘freendes, I am hoor and old, And almost, god wot, on my pittes brinke; Up-on my soule somwhat moste I thinke. I have my body folily despended; Blessed be god, that it shal been amended! For I wol be, certeyn, a wedded man, And that anoon in al the haste I can, Un-to som mayde fair and tendre of age. I prey yow, shapeth for my mariage Al sodeynly, for I wol nat abyde; And I wol fonde tespyen, on my syde, To whom I may be wedded hastily. But for-as-muche as ye ben mo than I, Ye shullen rather swich a thing espyen Than I, and wher me best were to allyen. But o thing warne I yow, my freendes dere, I wol non old wyf han in no manere. She shal nat passe twenty yeer, certayn; Old fish and yong flesh wolde I have ful fayn. Bet is,’ quod he, ‘a pyk than a pikerel; And bet than old boef is the tendre veel. I wol no womman thritty yeer of age, It is but bene-straw and greet forage. And eek thise olde widwes, god it woot, They conne so muchel craft on Wades boot, So muchel broken harm, whan that hem leste, That with hem sholde I never live in reste. For sondry scoles maken sotil clerkis; Womman of manye scoles half a clerk is. But certeynly, a yong thing may men gye, Right as men may warm wex with handes plye. Wherfore I sey yow pleynly, in a clause, I wol non old wyf han right for this cause. For if so were, I hadde swich mischaunce, That I in hir ne coude han no plesaunce, Thanne sholde I lede my lyf in avoutrye, And go streight to the devel, whan I dye. Ne children sholde I none up-on hir geten; Yet were me lever houndes had me eten, Than that myn heritage sholde falle In straunge hand, and this I tell yow alle. I dote nat, I woot the cause why Men sholde wedde, and forthermore wot I, Ther speketh many a man of mariage, That woot na-more of it than woot my page, For whiche causes man sholde take a wyf. If he ne may nat liven chast his lyf, Take him a wyf with greet devocioun, By-cause of leveful procreacioun Of children, to thonour of god above, And nat only for paramour or love; And for they sholde lecherye eschue, And yelde hir dettes whan that they ben due; Or for that ech of hem sholde helpen other In meschief, as a suster shal the brother; And live in chastitee ful holily. But sires, by your leve, that am nat I. For god be thanked, I dar make avaunt, I fele my limes stark and suffisaunt To do al that a man bilongeth to; I woot my-selven best what I may do. Though I be hoor, I fare as dooth a tree That blosmeth er that fruyt y-woxen be; A blosmy tree nis neither drye ne deed. I fele me nowher hoor but on myn heed; Myn herte and alle my limes been as grene As laurer thurgh the yeer is for to sene. And sin that ye han herd al myn entente, I prey yow to my wil ye wole assente.’ Diverse men diversely him tolde Of mariage manye ensamples olde. Somme blamed it, somme preysed it, certeyn; But atte laste, shortly for to seyn, As al day falleth altercacioun Bitwixen freendes in disputisoun, Ther fil a stryf bitwixe his bretheren two, Of whiche that oon was cleped Placebo, Iustinus soothly called was that other. Placebo seyde, ‘o Ianuarie, brother, Ful litel nede had ye, my lord so dere, Conseil to axe of any that is here; But that ye been so ful of sapience, That yow ne lyketh, for your heighe prudence, To weyven fro the word of Salomon. This word seyde he un-to us everichon: “Wirk alle thing by conseil,” thus seyde he, “And thanne shaltow nat repente thee.” But though that Salomon spak swich a word, Myn owene dere brother and my lord, So wisly god my soule bringe at reste, I hold your owene conseil is the beste. For brother myn, of me tak this motyf, I have now been a court-man al my lyf. And god it woot, though I unworthy be, I have stonden in ful greet degree Abouten lordes of ful heigh estaat; Yet hadde I never with noon of hem debaat. I never hem contraried, trewely; I woot wel that my lord can more than I. What that he seith, I holde it ferme and stable; I seye the same, or elles thing semblable. A ful gret fool is any conseillour, That serveth any lord of heigh honour, That dar presume, or elles thenken it, That his conseil sholde passe his lordes wit. Nay, lordes been no foles, by my fay; Ye han your-selven shewed heer to-day So heigh sentence, so holily and weel, That I consente and conferme every-deel Your wordes alle, and your opinioun. By god, ther nis no man in al this toun Nin al Itaille, that coude bet han sayd; Crist halt him of this conseil wel apayd. And trewely, it is an heigh corage Of any man, that stopen is in age, To take a yong wyf; by my fader kin, Your herte hangeth on a Ioly pin. Doth now in this matere right as yow leste, For finally I holde it for the beste.’ Iustinus, that ay stille sat and herde, Right in this wyse to Placebo answerde: ‘Now brother myn, be pacient, I preye, Sin ye han seyd, and herkneth what I seye. Senek among his othere wordes wyse Seith, that a man oghte him right wel avyse, To whom he yeveth his lond or his catel. And sin I oghte avyse me right wel To whom I yeve my good awey fro me, Wel muchel more I oghte avysed be To whom I yeve my body; for alwey I warne yow wel, it is no childes pley To take a wyf with-oute avysement. Men moste enquere, this is myn assent, Wher she be wys, or sobre, or dronkelewe, Or proud, or elles other-weys a shrewe; A chydester, or wastour of thy good, Or riche, or poore, or elles mannish wood. Al-be-it so that no man finden shal Noon in this world that trotteth hool in al, Ne man ne beest, swich as men coude devyse; But nathelees, it oghte y-nough suffise With any wyf, if so were that she hadde Mo gode thewes than hir vyces badde; And al this axeth leyser for tenquere. For god it woot, I have wept many a tere Ful prively, sin I have had a wyf. Preyse who-so wole a wedded mannes lyf, Certein, I finde in it but cost and care, And observances, of alle blisses bare. And yet, god woot, my neighebores aboute, And namely of wommen many a route, Seyn that I have the moste stedefast wyf, And eek the mekeste oon that bereth lyf. But I wot best wher wringeth me my sho. Ye mowe, for me, right as yow lyketh do; Avyseth yow, ye been a man of age, How that ye entren in-to mariage, And namely with a yong wyf and a fair. By him that made water, erthe, and air, The yongest man that is in al this route Is bisy y-nogh to bringen it aboute To han his wyf allone, trusteth me. Ye shul nat plese hir fully yeres three, This is to seyn, to doon hir ful plesaunce. A wyf axeth ful many an observaunce. I prey yow that ye be nat yvel apayd.’ ‘Wel,’ qoud this Ianuarie, ‘and hastow sayd? Straw for thy Senek, and for thy proverbes, I counte nat a panier ful of herbes Of scole-termes; wyser men than thow, As thou hast herd, assenteden right now To my purpos; Placebo, what sey ye?’ ‘I seye, it is a cursed man,’ quod he, ‘That letteth matrimoine, sikerly.’ And with that word they rysen sodeynly, And been assented fully, that he sholde Be wedded whanne him list and wher he wolde. Heigh fantasye and curious bisinesse Fro day to day gan in the soule impresse Of Ianuarie aboute his mariage. Many fair shap, and many a fair visage Ther passeth thurgh his herte, night by night. As who-so toke a mirour polished bright, And sette it in a commune market-place, Than sholde he see many a figure pace By his mirour; and, in the same wyse, Gan Ianuarie inwith his thoght devyse Of maydens, whiche that dwelten him bisyde. He wiste nat wher that he mighte abyde. For if that oon have beaute in hir face, Another stant so in the peples grace For hir sadnesse, and hir benignitee, That of the peple grettest voys hath she. And somme were riche, and hadden badde name. But nathelees, bitwixe ernest and game, He atte laste apoynted him on oon, And leet alle othere from his herte goon, And chees hir of his owene auctoritee; For love is blind al day, and may nat see. And whan that he was in his bed y-broght, He purtreyed, in his herte and in his thoght, Hir fresshe beautee and hir age tendre, Hir myddel smal, hir armes longe and sclendre, Hir wyse governaunce, hir gentillesse, Hir wommanly beringe and hir sadnesse. And whan that he on hir was condescended, Him thoughte his chois mighte nat ben amended. For whan that he him-self concluded hadde, Him thoughte ech other mannes wit so badde, That inpossible it were to replye Agayn his chois, this was his fantasye. His freendes sente he to at his instaunce, And preyed hem to doon him that plesaunce, That hastily they wolden to him come; He wolde abregge hir labour, alle and some. Nedeth na-more for him to go ne ryde, He was apoynted ther he wolde abyde. Placebo cam, and eek his freendes sone, And alderfirst he bad hem alle a bone, That noon of hem none argumentes make Agayn the purpos which that he hath take; ‘Which purpos was plesant to god,’ seyde he, ‘And verray ground of his prosperitee.’ He seyde, ther was a mayden in the toun, Which that of beautee hadde greet renoun, Al were it so she were of smal degree; Suffyseth him hir youthe and hir beautee. Which mayde, he seyde, he wolde han to his wyf, To lede in ese and holinesse his lyf. And thanked god, that he mighte han hire al, That no wight of his blisse parten shal. And preyde hem to labouren in this nede, And shapen that he faille nat to spede; For thanne, he seyde, his spirit was at ese. ‘Thanne is,’ quod he, ‘no-thing may me displese, Save o thing priketh in my conscience, The which I wol reherce in your presence. I have,’ quod he, ‘herd seyd, ful yore ago, Ther may no man han parfite blisses two, This is to seye, in erthe and eek in hevene. For though he kepe him fro the sinnes sevene, And eek from every branche of thilke tree, Yet is ther so parfit felicitee, And so greet ese and lust in mariage, That ever I am agast, now in myn age, That I shal lede now so mery a lyf, So delicat, with-outen wo and stryf, That I shal have myn hevene in erthe here. For sith that verray hevene is boght so dere, With tribulacioun and greet penaunce, How sholde I thanne, that live in swich plesaunce As alle wedded men don with hir wyvis, Come to the blisse ther Crist eterne on lyve is? This is my drede, and ye, my bretheren tweye, Assoilleth me this questioun, I preye.’ Iustinus, which that hated his folye, Answerde anon, right in his Iaperye; And for he wolde his longe tale abregge, He wolde noon auctoritee allegge, But seyde, ‘sire, so ther be noon obstacle Other than this, god of his hye miracle And of his mercy may so for yow wirche, That, er ye have your right of holy chirche, Ye may repente of wedded mannes lyf, In which ye seyn ther is no wo ne stryf. And elles, god forbede but he sente A wedded man him grace to repente Wel ofte rather than a sengle man! And therfore, sire, the beste reed I can, Dispeire yow noght, but have in your memorie, Paraunter she may be your purgatorie! She may be goddes mene, and goddes whippe; Than shal your soule up to hevene skippe Swifter than dooth an arwe out of the bowe! I hope to god, her-after shul ye knowe, That their nis no so greet felicitee In mariage, ne never-mo shal be, That yow shal lette of your savacioun, So that ye use, as skile is and resoun, The lustes of your wyf attemprely, And that ye plese hir nat to amorously, And that ye kepe yow eek from other sinne. My tale is doon:—for my wit is thinne. Beth nat agast her-of, my brother dere.’— (But lat us waden out of this matere. The Wyf of Bathe, if ye han understonde, Of mariage, which we have on honde, Declared hath ful wel in litel space).— ‘Fareth now wel, god have yow in his grace.’ And with this word this Iustin and his brother Han take hir leve, and ech of hem of other. For whan they sawe it moste nedes be, They wroghten so, by sly and wys tretee, That she, this mayden, which that Maius highte, As hastily as ever that she mighte, Shal wedded be un-to this Ianuarie. I trowe it were to longe yow to tarie, If I yow tolde of every scrit and bond, By which that she was feffed in his lond; Or for to herknen of hir riche array. But finally y-comen is the day That to the chirche bothe be they went For to receyve the holy sacrement. Forth comth the preest, with stole aboute his nekke, And bad hir be lyk Sarra and Rebekke, In wisdom and in trouthe of mariage; And seyde his orisons, as is usage, And crouched hem, and bad god sholde hem blesse, And made al siker y-nogh with holinesse. Thus been they wedded with solempnitee, And at the feste sitteth he and she With other worthy folk up-on the deys. Al ful of Ioye and blisse is the paleys, And ful of instruments and of vitaille, The moste deyntevous of al Itaille. Biforn hem stoode swiche instruments of soun, That Orpheus, ne of Thebes Amphioun, Ne maden never swich a melodye. At every cours than cam loud minstraleye, That never tromped Ioab, for to here, Nor he, Theodomas, yet half so clere, At Thebes, whan the citee was in doute. Bacus the wyn hem skinketh al aboute, And Venus laugheth up-on every wight. For Ianuarie was bicome hir knight, And wolde bothe assayen his corage In libertee, and eek in mariage; And with hir fyrbrond in hir hand aboute Daunceth biforn the bryde and al the route. And certeinly, I dar right wel seyn this, Ymenëus, that god of wedding is, Saugh never his lyf so mery a wedded man. Hold thou thy pees, thou poete Marcian, That wrytest us that ilke wedding murie Of hir, Philologye, and him, Mercurie, And of the songes that the Muses songe. To smal is bothe thy penne, and eek thy tonge, For to descryven of this mariage. Whan tendre youthe hath wedded stouping age, Ther is swich mirthe that it may nat be writen; Assayeth it your-self, than may ye witen If that I lye or noon in this matere. Maius, that sit with so benigne a chere, Hir to biholde it semed fayëryë; Quene Ester loked never with swich an yë On Assuer, so meke a look hath she. I may yow nat devyse al hir beautee; But thus muche of hir beautee telle I may, That she was lyk the brighte morwe of May, Fulfild of alle beautee and plesaunce. This Ianuarie is ravisshed in a traunce At every time he loked on hir face; But in his herte he gan hir to manace, That he that night in armes wolde hir streyne Harder than ever Paris dide Eleyne. But nathelees, yet hadde he greet pitee, That thilke night offenden hir moste he; And thoughte, ‘allas! o tendre creature! Now wolde god ye mighte wel endure Al my corage, it is so sharp and kene; I am agast ye shul it nat sustene. But god forbede that I dide al my might! Now wolde god that it were woxen night, And that the night wolde lasten evermo. I wolde that al this peple were ago.’ And finally, he doth al his labour, As he best mighte, savinge his honour, To haste hem fro the mete in subtil wyse. The tyme cam that reson was to ryse; And after that, men daunce and drinken faste, And spyces al aboute the hous they caste; And ful of Ioye and blisse is every man; All but a squyer, highte Damian, Which carf biforn the knight ful many a day. He was so ravisshed on his lady May, That for the verray peyne he was ny wood; Almost he swelte and swowned ther he stood. So sore hath Venus hurt him with hir brond, As that she bar it daunsinge in hir hond. And to his bed he wente him hastily; Na-more of him as at this tyme speke I. But ther I lete him wepe y-nough and pleyne, Til fresshe May wol rewen on his peyne. O perilous fyr, that in the bedstraw bredeth! Auctor. O famulier foo, that his servyce bedeth! O servant traitour, false hoomly hewe, Lyk to the naddre in bosom sly untrewe, God shilde us alle from your aqueyntaunce! O Ianuarie, dronken in plesaunce Of mariage, see how thy Damian, Thyn owene squyer and thy borne man, Entendeth for to do thee vileinye. God graunte thee thyn hoomly fo tespye. For in this world nis worse pestilence Than hoomly foo al day in thy presence. Parfourned hath the sonne his ark diurne, No lenger may the body of him soiurne On thorisonte, as in that latitude. Night with his mantel, that is derk and rude, Gan oversprede the hemisperie aboute; For which departed is this lusty route Fro Ianuarie, with thank on every syde. Hom to hir houses lustily they ryde, Wher-as they doon hir thinges as hem leste, And whan they sye hir tyme, goon to reste. Sone after that, this hastif Ianuarie Wolde go to bedde, he wolde no lenger tarie. He drinketh ipocras, clarree, and vernage Of spyces hote, tencresen his corage; And many a letuarie hadde he ful fyn, Swiche as the cursed monk dan Constantyn Hath writen in his book de Coitu; To eten hem alle, he nas no-thing eschu. And to his privee freendes thus seyde he: ‘For goddes love, as sone as it may be, Lat voyden al this hous in curteys wyse.’ And they han doon right as he wol devyse. Men drinken, and the travers drawe anon; The bryde was broght a-bedde as stille as stoon; And whan the bed was with the preest y-blessed, Out of the chambre hath every wight him dressed. And Ianuarie hath faste in armes take His fresshe May, his paradys, his make. He lulleth hir, he kisseth hir ful ofte With thikke bristles of his berd unsofte, Lyk to the skin of houndfish, sharp as brere, For he was shave al newe in his manere. He rubbeth hir aboute hir tendre face, And seyde thus, ‘allas! I moot trespace To yow, my spouse, and yow gretly offende, Er tyme come that I wil doun descende. But nathelees, considereth this,’ quod he, ‘Ther nis no werkman, what-so-ever he be, That may bothe werke wel and hastily; This wol be doon at leyser parfitly. It is no fors how longe that we pleye; In trewe wedlok wedded be we tweye; And blessed be the yok that we been inne, For in our actes we mowe do no sinne. A man may do no sinne with his wyf, Ne hurte him-selven with his owene knyf; For we han leve to pleye us by the lawe.’ Thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe; And than he taketh a sop in fyn clarree, And upright in his bed than sitteth he, And after that he sang ful loude and clere, And kiste his wyf, and made wantoun chere. He was al coltish, ful of ragerye, And ful of Iargon as a flekked pye. The slakke skin aboute his nekke shaketh, Whyl that he sang; so chaunteth he and craketh. But god wot what that May thoughte in hir herte, Whan she him saugh up sittinge in his sherte, In his night-cappe, and with his nekke lene; She preyseth nat his pleying worth a bene. Than seide he thus, ‘my reste wol I take; Now day is come, I may no lenger wake.’ And doun he leyde his heed, and sleep til pryme. And afterward, whan that he saugh his tyme, Up ryseth Ianuarie; but fresshe May Holdeth hir chambre un-to the fourthe day, As usage is of wyves for the beste. For every labour som-tyme moot han reste, Or elles longe may he nat endure; This is to seyn, no lyves creature, Be it of fish, or brid, or beest, or man. Now wol I speke of woful Damian, Auctor. That languissheth for love, as ye shul here; Therfore I speke to him in this manere: I seye, ‘O sely Damian, allas! Answere to my demaunde, as in this cas, How shaltow to thy lady fresshe May Telle thy wo? She wole alwey seye “nay”; Eek if thou speke, she wol thy wo biwreye; God be thyn help, I can no bettre seye.’ This syke Damian in Venus fyr So brenneth, that he dyeth for desyr; For which he putte his lyf in aventure, No lenger mighte he in this wyse endure; But prively a penner gan he borwe, And in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe, In manere of a compleynt or a lay, Un-to his faire fresshe lady May. And in a purs of silk, heng on his sherte, He hath it put, and leyde it at his herte. The mone that, at noon, was, thilke day That Ianuarie hath wedded fresshe May, In two of Taur, was in-to Cancre gliden; So longe hath Maius in hir chambre biden, As custume is un-to thise nobles alle. A bryde shal nat eten in the halle, Til dayes foure or three dayes atte leste Y-passed been; than lat hir go to feste. The fourthe day compleet fro noon to noon, Whan that the heighe masse was y-doon, In halle sit this Ianuarie, and May As fresh as is the brighte someres day. And so bifel, how that this gode man Remembred him upon this Damian, And seyde, ‘Seinte Marie! how may this be, That Damian entendeth nat to me? Is he ay syk, or how may this bityde?’ His squyeres, whiche that stoden ther bisyde, Excused him by-cause of his siknesse, Which letted him to doon his bisinesse; Noon other cause mighte make him tarie. ‘That me forthinketh,’ quod this Ianuarie, ‘He is a gentil squyer, by my trouthe! If that he deyde, it were harm and routhe; He is as wys, discreet, and as secree As any man I woot of his degree; And ther-to manly and eek servisable, And for to been a thrifty man right able. But after mete, as sone as ever I may, I wol my-self visyte him and eek May, To doon him al the confort that I can.’ And for that word him blessed every man, That, of his bountee and his gentillesse, He wolde so conforten in siknesse His squyer, for it was a gentil dede. ‘Dame,’ quod this Ianuarie, ‘tak good hede, At-after mete ye, with your wommen alle, Whan ye han been in chambre out of this halle, That alle ye go see this Damian; Doth him disport, he is a gentil man; And telleth him that I wol him visyte, Have I no-thing but rested me a lyte; And spede yow faste, for I wole abyde Til that ye slepe faste by my syde.’ And with that word he gan to him to calle A squyer, that was marchal of his halle, And tolde him certeyn thinges, what he wolde. This fresshe May hath streight hir wey y-holde, With alle hir wommen, un-to Damian. Doun by his beddes syde sit she than, Confortinge him as goodly as she may. This Damian, whan that his tyme he say, In secree wise his purs, and eek his bille, In which that he y-writen hadde his wille, Hath put in-to hir hand, with-outen more, Save that he syketh wonder depe and sore, And softely to hir right thus seyde he: ‘Mercy! and that ye nat discovere me; For I am deed, if that this thing be kid.’ This purs hath she inwith hir bosom hid, And wente hir wey; ye gete namore of me. But un-to Ianuarie y-comen is she, That on his beddes syde sit ful softe. He taketh hir, and kisseth hir ful ofte, And leyde him doun to slepe, and that anon. She feyned hir as that she moste gon Ther-as ye woot that every wight mot nede. And whan she of this bille hath taken hede, She rente it al to cloutes atte laste, And in the privee softely it caste. Who studieth now but faire fresshe May? Adoun by olde Ianuarie she lay, That sleep, til that the coughe hath him awaked; Anon he preyde hir strepen hir al naked; He wolde of hir, he seyde, han som plesaunce, And seyde, hir clothes dide him encombraunce, And she obeyeth, be hir lief or looth. But lest that precious folk be with me wrooth, How that he wroghte, I dar nat to yow telle; Or whether hir thoughte it paradys or helle; But here I lete hem werken in hir wyse Til evensong rong, and that they moste aryse. Were it by destinee or aventure, Were it by influence or by nature, Or constellacion, that in swich estat The hevene stood, that tyme fortunat Was for to putte a bille of Venus werkes (For alle thing hath tyme, as seyn thise clerkes) To any womman, for to gete hir love, I can nat seye; but grete god above, That knoweth that non act is causelees, He deme of al, for I wol holde my pees. But sooth is this, how that this fresshe May Hath take swich impression that day, For pitee of this syke Damian, That from hir herte she ne dryve can The remembraunce for to doon him ese. ‘Certeyn,’ thoghte she, ‘whom that this thing displese, I rekke noght, for here I him assure, To love him best of any creature, Though he na-more hadde than his sherte.’ Lo, pitee renneth sone in gentil herte. Heer may ye se how excellent franchyse In wommen is, whan they hem narwe avyse. Som tyrant is, as ther be many oon, That hath an herte as hard as any stoon, Which wolde han lete him sterven in the place Wel rather than han graunted him hir grace; And hem reioysen in hir cruel pryde, And rekke nat to been an homicyde. This gentil May, fulfilled of pitee, Right of hir hande a lettre made she, In which she graunteth him hir verray grace; Ther lakketh noght but only day and place, Wher that she mighte un-to his lust suffyse: For it shal be right as he wol devyse. And whan she saugh hir time, up-on a day, To visite this Damian goth May, And sotilly this lettre doun she threste Under his pilwe, rede it if him leste. She taketh him by the hand, and harde him twiste So secrely, that no wight of it wiste, And bad him been al hool, and forth she wente To Ianuarie, whan that he for hir sente. Up ryseth Damian the nexte morwe, Al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe. He kembeth him, he proyneth him and pyketh, He dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh; And eek to Ianuarie he gooth as lowe As ever dide a dogge for the bowe. He is so plesant un-to every man, (For craft is al, who-so that do it can) That every wight is fayn to speke him good; And fully in his lady grace he stood. Thus lete I Damian aboute his nede, And in my tale forth I wol procede. Somme clerkes holden that felicitee Stant in delyt, and therefor certeyn he, This noble Ianuarie, with al his might, In honest wyse, as longeth to a knight, Shoop him to live ful deliciously. His housinge, his array, as honestly To his degree was maked as a kinges. Amonges othere of his honest thinges, He made a gardin, walled al with stoon; So fair a gardin woot I nowher noon. For out of doute, I verraily suppose, That he that wroot the Romance of the Rose Ne coude of it the beautee wel devyse; Ne Priapus ne mighte nat suffyse, Though he be god of gardins, for to telle The beautee of the gardin and the welle, That stood under a laurer alwey grene. Ful ofte tyme he, Pluto, and his quene, Proserpina, and al hir fayërye Disporten hem and maken melodye Aboute that welle, and daunced, as men tolde. This noble knight, this Ianuarie the olde, Swich deintee hath in it to walke and pleye, That he wol no wight suffren bere the keye Save he him-self; for of the smale wiket He bar alwey of silver a smal cliket, With which, whan that him leste, he it unshette. And whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette In somer seson, thider wolde he go, And May his wyf, and no wight but they two; And thinges whiche that were nat doon a-bedde, He in the gardin parfourned hem and spedde. And in this wyse, many a mery day, Lived this Ianuarie and fresshe May. But worldly Ioye may nat alwey dure To Ianuarie, ne to no creature. O sodeyn hap, o thou fortune instable, Lyk to the scorpioun so deceivable, That flaterest with thyn heed when thou wolt stinge; Thy tayl is deeth, thurgh thyn enveniminge. O brotil Ioye! o swete venim queynte! O monstre, that so subtilly canst peynte Thy yiftes, under hewe of stedfastnesse, That thou deceyvest bothe more and lesse! Why hastow Ianuari thus deceyved, That haddest him for thy ful frend receyved? And now thou hast biraft him bothe hise yën, For sorwe of which desyreth he to dyen. Allas! this noble Ianuarie free, Amidde his lust and his prosperitee, Is woxen blind, and that al sodeynly. He wepeth and he wayleth pitously; And ther-with-al the fyr of Ialousye, Lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye, So brente his herte, that he wolde fayn That som man bothe him and hir had slayn. For neither after his deeth, nor in his lyf, Ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf, But ever live as widwe in clothes blake, Soul as the turtle that lost hath hir make. But atte laste, after a monthe or tweye, His sorwe gan aswage, sooth to seye; For whan he wiste it may noon other be, He paciently took his adversitee; Save, out of doute, he may nat forgoon That he nas Ialous evermore in oon; Which Ialousye it was so outrageous, That neither in halle, nin noon other hous, Ne in noon other place, never-the-mo, He nolde suffre hir for to ryde or go, But-if that he had hand on hir alway; For which ful ofte wepeth fresshe May, That loveth Damian so benignely, That she mot outher dyen sodeynly, Or elles she mot han him as hir leste; She wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste. Up-on that other syde Damian Bicomen is the sorwefulleste man That ever was; for neither night ne day Ne mighte he speke a word to fresshe May, As to his purpos, of no swich matere, But-if that Ianuarie moste it here, That hadde an hand up-on hir evermo. But nathelees, by wryting to and fro And privee signes, wiste he what she mente; And she knew eek the fyn of his entente. O Ianuarie, what mighte it thee availle, Auctor. Thou mightest see as fer as shippes saille? For also good is blind deceyved be, As be deceyved whan a man may se. Lo, Argus, which that hadde an hondred yën, For al that ever he coude poure or pryen, Yet was he blent; and, god wot, so ben mo, That wenen wisly that it be nat so. Passe over is an ese, I sey na-more. This fresshe May, that I spak of so yore, In warme wex hath emprented the cliket, That Ianuarie bar of the smale wiket, By which in-to his gardin ofte he wente. And Damian, that knew al hir entente, The cliket countrefeted prively; Ther nis na-more to seye, but hastily Som wonder by this cliket shal bityde, Which ye shul heren, if ye wole abyde. O noble Ovyde, ful sooth seystou, god woot! Auctor. What sleighte is it, thogh it be long and hoot, That he nil finde it out in som manere? By Piramus and Tesbee may men lere; Thogh they were kept ful longe streite overal, They been accorded, rouninge thurgh a wal, Ther no wight coude han founde out swich a sleighte. But now to purpos; er that dayes eighte Were passed, er the monthe of Iuil, bifil That Ianuarie hath caught so greet a wil, Thurgh egging of his wyf, him for to pleye In his gardin, and no wight but they tweye, That in a morwe un-to this May seith he: ‘Rys up, my wyf, my love, my lady free; The turtles vois is herd, my douve swete; The winter is goon, with alle his reynes wete; Com forth now, with thyn eyën columbyn! How fairer been thy brestes than is wyn! The gardin is enclosed al aboute; Com forth, my whyte spouse; out of doute, Thou hast me wounded in myn herte, o wyf! No spot of thee ne knew I al my lyf. Com forth, and lat us taken our disport; I chees thee for my wyf and my confort.’ Swiche olde lewed wordes used he; On Damian a signe made she, That he sholde go biforen with his cliket: This Damian thanne hath opened the wiket, And in he stirte, and that in swich manere, That no wight mighte it see neither y-here; And stille he sit under a bush anoon. This Ianuarie, as blind as is a stoon, With Maius in his hand, and no wight mo, In-to his fresshe gardin is ago, And clapte to the wiket sodeynly. ‘Now, wyf,’ quod he, ‘heer nis but thou and I, That art the creature that I best love. For, by that lord that sit in heven above, Lever ich hadde dyen on a knyf, Than thee offende, trewe dere wyf! For goddes sake, thenk how I thee chees, Noght for no coveityse, doutelees, But only for the love I had to thee. And though that I be old, and may nat see, Beth to me trewe, and I shal telle yow why. Three thinges, certes, shul ye winne ther-by; First, love of Crist, and to your-self honour, And al myn heritage, toun and tour; I yeve it yow, maketh chartres as yow leste; This shal be doon to-morwe er sonne reste. So wisly god my soule bringe in blisse, I prey yow first, in covenant ye me kisse. And thogh that I be Ialous, wyte me noght. Ye been so depe enprented in my thoght, That, whan that I considere your beautee, And ther-with-al the unlykly elde of me, I may nat, certes, thogh I sholde dye, Forbere to been out of your companye For verray love; this is with-outen doute. Now kis me, wyf, and lat us rome aboute.’ This fresshe May, whan she thise wordes herde, Benignely to Ianuarie answerde, But first and forward she bigan to wepe, ‘I have,’ quod she, ‘a soule for to kepe As wel as ye, and also myn honour, And of my wyfhod thilke tendre flour, Which that I have assured in your hond, Whan that the preest to yow my body bond; Wherfore I wole answere in this manere By the leve of yow, my lord so dere: I prey to god, that never dawe the day That I ne sterve, as foule as womman may, If ever I do un-to my kin that shame, Or elles I empeyre so my name, That I be fals; and if I do that lakke, Do strepe me and put me in a sakke, And in the nexte river do me drenche. I am a gentil womman and no wenche. Why speke ye thus? but men ben ever untrewe, And wommen have repreve of yow ay newe. Ye han non other contenance, I leve, But speke to us of untrust and repreve.’ And with that word she saugh wher Damian Sat in the bush, and coughen she bigan, And with hir finger signes made she, That Damian sholde climbe up-on a tree, That charged was with fruit, and up he wente; For verraily he knew al hir entente, And every signe that she coude make Wel bet than Ianuarie, hir owene make. For in a lettre she had told him al Of this matere, how he werchen shal. And thus I lete him sitte up-on the pyrie, And Ianuarie and May rominge myrie. Bright was the day, and blew the firmament, Phebus of gold his stremes doun hath sent, To gladen every flour with his warmnesse. He was that tyme in Geminis, as I gesse, But litel fro his declinacioun Of Cancer, Iovis exaltacioun. And so bifel, that brighte morwe-tyde, That in that gardin, in the ferther syde, Pluto, that is the king of fayërye, And many a lady in his companye, Folwinge his wyf, the quene Proserpyne, Ech after other, right as any lyne— Whil that she gadered floures in the mede, In Claudian ye may the story rede, How in his grisly carte he hir fette:— This king of fairye thanne adoun him sette Up-on a bench of turves, fresh and grene, And right anon thus seyde he to his quene. ‘My wyf,’ quod he, ‘ther may no wight sey nay; Thexperience so preveth every day The treson whiche that wommen doon to man. Ten hondred thousand [stories] telle I can Notable of your untrouthe and brotilnesse. O Salomon, wys, richest of richesse, Fulfild of sapience and of worldly glorie, Ful worthy been thy wordes to memorie To every wight that wit and reson can. Thus preiseth he yet the bountee of man: “Amonges a thousand men yet fond I oon, But of wommen alle fond I noon.” Thus seith the king that knoweth your wikkednesse; And Iesus filius Syrak, as I gesse, Ne speketh of yow but selde reverence. A wilde fyr and corrupt pestilence So falle up-on your bodies yet to-night! Ne see ye nat this honurable knight, By-cause, allas! that he is blind and old, His owene man shal make him cokewold; Lo heer he sit, the lechour, in the tree. Now wol I graunten, of my magestee, Un-to this olde blinde worthy knight That he shal have ayeyn his eyen sight, Whan that his wyf wold doon him vileinye; Than shal he knowen al hir harlotrye Both in repreve of hir and othere mo.’ ‘Ye shal,’ quod Proserpyne, ‘wol ye so; Now, by my modres sires soule I swere, That I shal yeven hir suffisant answere, And alle wommen after, for hir sake; That, though they be in any gilt y-take, With face bold they shulle hem-self excuse, And bere hem doun that wolden hem accuse. For lakke of answer, noon of hem shal dyen. Al hadde man seyn a thing with bothe his yën, Yit shul we wommen visage it hardily, And wepe, and swere, and chyde subtilly, So that ye men shul been as lewed as gees. What rekketh me of your auctoritees? I woot wel that this Iew, this Salomon, Fond of us wommen foles many oon. But though that he ne fond no good womman, Yet hath ther founde many another man Wommen ful trewe, ful gode, and vertuous. Witnesse on hem that dwelle in Cristes hous, With martirdom they preved hir constance. The Romayn gestes maken remembrance Of many a verray trewe wyf also. But sire, ne be nat wrooth, al-be-it so, Though that he seyde he fond no good womman, I prey yow take the sentence of the man; He mente thus, that in sovereyn bontee Nis noon but god, that sit in Trinitee. Ey! for verray god, that nis but oon, What make ye so muche of Salomon? What though he made a temple, goddes hous? What though he were riche and glorious? So made he eek a temple of false goddis, How mighte he do a thing that more forbode is? Pardee, as faire as ye his name emplastre, He was a lechour and an ydolastre; And in his elde he verray god forsook. And if that god ne hadde, as seith the book, Y-spared him for his fadres sake, he sholde Have lost his regne rather than he wolde. I sette noght of al the vileinye, That ye of wommen wryte, a boterflye. I am a womman, nedes moot I speke, Or elles swelle til myn herte breke. For sithen he seyde that we ben Iangleresses, As ever hool I mote brouke my tresses, I shal nat spare, for no curteisye, To speke him harm that wolde us vileinye.’ ‘Dame,’ quod this Pluto, ‘be no lenger wrooth; I yeve it up; but sith I swoor myn ooth That I wolde graunten him his sighte ageyn, My word shal stonde, I warne yow, certeyn. I am a king, it sit me noght to lye.’ ‘And I,’ quod she, ‘a queene of fayërye. Hir answere shal she have, I undertake; Lat us na-more wordes heer-of make. For sothe, I wol no lenger yow contrarie.’ Now lat us turne agayn to Ianuarie, That in the gardin with his faire May Singeth, ful merier than the papeiay, ‘Yow love I best, and shal, and other noon.’ So longe aboute the aleyes is he goon, Til he was come agaynes thilke pyrie, Wher-as this Damian sitteth ful myrie An heigh, among the fresshe leves grene. This fresshe May, that is so bright and shene, Gan for to syke, and seyde, ‘allas, my syde! Now sir,’ quod she, ‘for aught that may bityde, I moste han of the peres that I see, Or I mot dye, so sore longeth me To eten of the smale peres grene. Help, for hir love that is of hevene quene! I telle yow wel, a womman in my plyt May han to fruit so greet an appetyt, That she may dyen, but she of it have.’ ‘Allas!’ quod he, ‘that I ne had heer a knave That coude climbe; allas! allas!’ quod he, ‘That I am blind.’ ‘Ye, sir, no fors,’ quod she: ‘But wolde ye vouche-sauf, for goddes sake, The pyrie inwith your armes for to take, (For wel I woot that ye mistruste me) Thanne sholde I climbe wel y-nogh,’ quod she, ‘So I my foot mighte sette upon your bak.’ ‘Certes,’ quod he, ‘ther-on shal be no lak, Mighte I yow helpen with myn herte blood.’ He stoupeth doun, and on his bak she stood, And caughte hir by a twiste, and up she gooth. Ladies, I prey yow that ye be nat wrooth; I can nat glose, I am a rude man. And sodeynly anon this Damian Gan pullen up the smok, and in he throng. And whan that Pluto saugh this grete wrong, To Ianuarie he gaf agayn his sighte, And made him see, as wel as ever he mighte. And whan that he hadde caught his sighte agayn, Ne was ther never man of thing so fayn. But on his wyf his thoght was evermo; Up to the tree he caste his eyen two, And saugh that Damian his wyf had dressed In swich manere, it may nat ben expressed But if I wolde speke uncurteisly: And up he yaf a roring and a cry As doth the moder whan the child shal dye: ‘Out! help! allas! harrow!’ he gan to crye, ‘O stronge lady store, what dostow?’ And she answerde, ‘sir, what eyleth yow? Have pacience, and reson in your minde, I have yow holpe on bothe your eyen blinde. Up peril of my soule, I shal nat lyen, As me was taught, to hele with your yën, Was no-thing bet to make yow to see Than strugle with a man up-on a tree. God woot, I dide it in ful good entente.’ ‘Strugle!’ quod he, ‘ye, algate in it wente! God yeve yow bothe on shames deeth to dyen! He swyved thee, I saugh it with myne yën, And elles be I hanged by the hals!’ ‘Thanne is,’ quod she, ‘my medicyne al fals; For certeinly, if that ye mighte see, Ye wolde nat seyn thise wordes un-to me; Ye han som glimsing and no parfit sighte.’ ‘I see,’ quod he, ‘as wel as ever I mighte, Thonked be god! with bothe myne eyen two, And by my trouthe, me thoughte he dide thee so.’ ‘Ye maze, maze, gode sire,’ quod she, ‘This thank have I for I have maad yow see; Allas!’ quod she, ‘that ever I was so kinde!’ ‘Now, dame,’ quod he, ‘lat al passe out of minde. Com doun, my lief, and if I have missayd, God help me so, as I am yvel apayd. But, by my fader soule, I wende han seyn, How that this Damian had by thee leyn, And that thy smok had leyn up-on his brest.’ ‘Ye, sire,’ quod she, ‘ye may wene as yow lest; But, sire, a man that waketh out of his sleep, He may nat sodeynly wel taken keep Up-on a thing, ne seen it parfitly, Til that he be adawed verraily; Right so a man, that longe hath blind y-be, Ne may nat sodeynly so wel y-see, First whan his sighte is newe come ageyn, As he that hath a day or two y-seyn. Til that your sighte y-satled be a whyle, Ther may ful many a sighte yow bigyle. Beth war, I prey yow; for, by hevene king, Ful many a man weneth to seen a thing, And it is al another than it semeth. He that misconceyveth, he misdemeth.’ And with that word she leep doun fro the tree. This Ianuarie, who is glad but he? He kisseth hir, and clippeth hir ful ofte, And on hir wombe he stroketh hir ful softe, And to his palays hoom he hath hir lad. Now, gode men, I pray yow to be glad. Thus endeth heer my tale of Ianuarie; God blesse us and his moder Seinte Marie! Here is ended the Marchantes Tale of Ianuarie. EPILOGUE TO THE MARCHANTES TALE. ‘Ey! goddes mercy!’ seyde our Hoste tho, ‘Now swich a wyf I pray god kepe me fro! Lo, whiche sleightes and subtilitees In wommen been! for ay as bisy as bees Ben they, us sely men for to deceyve, And from a sothe ever wol they weyve; By this Marchauntes Tale it preveth weel. But doutelees, as trewe as any steel I have a wyf, though that she povre be; But of hir tonge a labbing shrewe is she, And yet she hath an heep of vyces mo; Ther-of no fors, lat alle swiche thinges go. But, wite ye what? in conseil be it seyd, Me reweth sore I am un-to hir teyd. For, and I sholde rekenen every vyce Which that she hath, y-wis, I were to nyce, And cause why; it sholde reported be And told to hir of somme of this meynee; Of whom, it nedeth nat for to declare, Sin wommen connen outen swich chaffare; And eek my wit suffyseth nat ther-to To tellen al; wherfor my tale is do.’ GROUP F. THE SQUIERES TALE. [The Squire's Prologue.] ‘Squier, com neer, if it your wille be, And sey somwhat of love; for, certes, ye Connen ther-on as muche as any man.’ ‘Nay, sir,’ quod he, ‘but I wol seye as I can With hertly wille; for I wol nat rebelle Agayn your lust; a tale wol I telle. Have me excused if I speke amis, My wil is good; and lo, my tale is this. Here biginneth the Squieres Tale. At Sarray, in the land of Tartarye, Ther dwelte a king, that werreyed Russye, Thurgh which ther deyde many a doughty man. This noble king was cleped Cambinskan, Which in his tyme was of so greet renoun That ther nas no-wher in no regioun So excellent a lord in alle thing; Him lakked noght that longeth to a king. As of the secte of which that he was born He kepte his lay, to which that he was sworn; And ther-to he was hardy, wys, and riche, And piëtous and Iust, alwey y-liche. Sooth of his word, benigne and honurable, Of his corage as any centre stable; Yong, fresh, and strong, in armes desirous As any bacheler of al his hous. A fair persone he was and fortunat, And kepte alwey so wel royal estat, That ther was nowher swich another man. This noble king, this Tartre Cambinskan Hadde two sones on Elpheta his wyf, Of whiche the eldeste highte Algarsyf, That other sone was cleped Cambalo. A doghter hadde this worthy king also, That yongest was, and highte Canacee. But for to telle yow al hir beautee, It lyth nat in my tonge, nin my conning; I dar nat undertake so heigh a thing. Myn English eek is insufficient; It moste been a rethor excellent, That coude his colours longing for that art, If he sholde hir discryven every part. I am non swich, I moot speke as I can. And so bifel that, whan this Cambinskan Hath twenty winter born his diademe, As he was wont fro yeer to yeer, I deme, He leet the feste of his nativitee Don cryen thurghout Sarray his citee, The last Idus of March, after the yeer. Phebus the sonne ful Ioly was and cleer; For he was neigh his exaltacioun In Martes face, and in his mansioun In Aries, the colerik hote signe. Ful lusty was the weder and benigne, For which the foules, agayn the sonne shene, What for the seson and the yonge grene, Ful loude songen hir affecciouns; Him semed han geten hem protecciouns Agayn the swerd of winter kene and cold. This Cambinskan, of which I have yow told, In royal vestiment sit on his deys, With diademe, ful heighe in his paleys, And halt his feste, so solempne and so riche That in this world ne was ther noon it liche. Of which if I shal tellen al tharray, Than wolde it occupye a someres day; And eek it nedeth nat for to devyse At every cours the ordre of hir servyse. I wol nat tellen of hir strange sewes, Ne of hir swannes, ne of hir heronsewes. Eek in that lond, as tellen knightes olde, Ther is som mete that is ful deyntee holde, That in this lond men recche of it but smal; Ther nis no man that may reporten al. I wol nat tarien yow, for it is pryme, And for it is no fruit but los of tyme; Un-to my firste I wol have my recours. And so bifel that, after the thridde cours, Whyl that this king sit thus in his nobleye, Herkninge his minstralles hir thinges pleye Biforn him at the bord deliciously, In at the halle-dore al sodeynly Ther cam a knight up-on a stede of bras, And in his hand a brood mirour of glas. Upon his thombe he hadde of gold a ring, And by his syde a naked swerd hanging; And up he rydeth to the heighe bord. In al the halle ne was ther spoke a word For merveille of this knight; him to biholde Ful bisily ther wayten yonge and olde. This strange knight, that cam thus sodeynly, Al armed save his heed ful richely, Saluëth king and queen, and lordes alle, By ordre, as they seten in the halle, With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce As wel in speche as in contenaunce, That Gawain, with his olde curteisye, Though he were come ageyn out of Fairye, Ne coude him nat amende with a word. And after this, biforn the heighe bord, He with a manly voys seith his message, After the forme used in his langage, With-outen vyce of sillable or of lettre; And, for his tale sholde seme the bettre, Accordant to his wordes was his chere, As techeth art of speche hem that it lere; Al-be-it that I can nat soune his style, Ne can nat climben over so heigh a style, Yet seye I this, as to commune entente, Thus muche amounteth al that ever he mente, If it so be that I have it in minde. He seyde, ‘the king of Arabie and of Inde, My lige lord, on this solempne day Saluëth yow as he best can and may, And sendeth yow, in honour of your feste, By me, that am al redy at your heste, This stede of bras, that esily and wel Can, in the space of o day naturel, This is to seyn, in foure and twenty houres, Wher-so yow list, in droghte or elles shoures, Beren your body in-to every place To which your herte wilneth for to pace With-outen wem of yow, thurgh foul or fair; Or, if yow list to fleen as hye in the air As doth an egle, whan him list to sore, This same stede shal bere yow ever-more With-outen harm, til ye be ther yow leste, Though that ye slepen on his bak or reste; And turne ayeyn, with wrything of a pin. He that it wroghte coude ful many a gin; He wayted many a constellacioun Er he had doon this operacioun; And knew ful many a seel and many a bond. This mirour eek, that I have in myn hond, Hath swich a might, that men may in it see Whan ther shal fallen any adversitee Un-to your regne or to your-self also; And openly who is your freend or foo. And over al this, if any lady bright Hath set hir herte on any maner wight, If he be fals, she shal his treson see, His newe love and al his subtiltee So openly, that ther shal no-thing hyde. Wherfor, ageyn this lusty someres tyde, This mirour and this ring, that ye may see, He hath sent to my lady Canacee, Your excellente doghter that is here. The vertu of the ring, if ye wol here, Is this; that, if hir lust it for to were Up-on hir thombe, or in hir purs it bere, Ther is no foul that fleeth under the hevene That she ne shal wel understonde his stevene, And knowe his mening openly and pleyn, And answere him in his langage ageyn. And every gras that groweth up-on rote She shal eek knowe, and whom it wol do bote, Al be his woundes never so depe and wyde. This naked swerd, that hangeth by my syde, Swich vertu hath, that what man so ye smyte, Thurgh-out his armure it wol kerve and byte, Were it as thikke as is a branched ook; And what man that is wounded with the strook Shal never be hool til that yow list, of grace, To stroke him with the platte in thilke place Ther he is hurt: this is as muche to seyn, Ye mote with the platte swerd ageyn Stroke him in the wounde, and it wol close; This is a verray sooth, with-outen glose, It failleth nat whyl it is in your hold.’ And whan this knight hath thus his tale told, He rydeth out of halle, and doun he lighte. His stede, which that shoon as sonne brighte, Stant in the court, as stille as any stoon. This knight is to his chambre lad anon, And is unarmed and to mete y-set. The presentes ben ful royally y-fet, This is to seyn, the swerd and the mirour, And born anon in-to the heighe tour With certeine officers ordeyned therfore; And un-to Canacee this ring was bore Solempnely, ther she sit at the table. But sikerly, with-outen any fable, The hors of bras, that may nat be remewed, It stant as it were to the ground y-glewed. Ther may no man out of the place it dryve For noon engyn of windas or polyve; And cause why, for they can nat the craft. And therefore in the place they han it laft Til that the knight hath taught hem the manere To voyden him, as ye shal after here. Greet was the prees, that swarmeth to and fro, To gauren on this hors that stondeth so; For it so heigh was, and so brood and long, So wel proporcioned for to ben strong, Right as it were a stede of Lumbardye; Ther-with so horsly, and so quik of yë As it a gentil Poileys courser were. For certes, fro his tayl un-to his ere, Nature ne art ne coude him nat amende In no degree, as al the peple wende. But evermore hir moste wonder was, How that it coude goon, and was of bras; It was of Fairye, as the peple semed. Diverse folk diversely they demed; As many hedes, as many wittes ther been. They murmureden as dooth a swarm of been, And maden skiles after hir fantasyes, Rehersinge of thise olde poetryes, And seyden, it was lyk the Pegasee, The hors that hadde winges for to flee; Or elles it was the Grekes hors Synon, That broghte Troye to destruccion, As men may in thise olde gestes rede. ‘Myn herte,’ quod oon, ‘is evermore in drede; I trowe som men of armes been ther-inne, That shapen hem this citee for to winne. It were right good that al swich thing were knowe.’ Another rowned to his felawe lowe, And seyde, ‘he lyeth, it is rather lyk An apparence y-maad by som magyk, As Iogelours pleyen at thise festes grete.’ Of sondry doutes thus they Iangle and trete, As lewed peple demeth comunly Of thinges that ben maad more subtilly Than they can in her lewednes comprehende; They demen gladly to the badder ende. And somme of hem wondred on the mirour, That born was up in-to the maister-tour, How men mighte in it swiche thinges see. Another answerde, and seyde it mighte wel be Naturelly, by composiciouns Of angles and of slye reflexiouns, And seyden, that in Rome was swich oon. They speken of Alocen and Vitulon, And Aristotle, that writen in hir lyves Of queynte mirours and of prospectyves, As knowen they that han hir bokes herd. And othere folk han wondred on the swerd That wolde percen thurgh-out every-thing; And fille in speche of Thelophus the king, And of Achilles with his queynte spere, For he coude with it bothe hele and dere, Right in swich wyse as men may with the swerd Of which right now ye han your-selven herd. They speken of sondry harding of metal, And speke of medicynes ther-with-al, And how, and whanne, it sholde y-harded be; Which is unknowe algates unto me. Tho speke they of Canaceës ring, And seyden alle, that swich a wonder thing Of craft of ringes herde they never non, Save that he, Moyses, and king Salomon Hadde a name of konning in swich art. Thus seyn the peple, and drawen hem apart. But nathelees, somme seyden that it was Wonder to maken of fern-asshen glas, And yet nis glas nat lyk asshen of fern; But for they han y-knowen it so fern, Therfore cesseth her Iangling and her wonder. As sore wondren somme on cause of thonder, On ebbe, on flood, on gossomer, and on mist, And alle thing, til that the cause is wist. Thus Iangle they and demen and devyse, Til that the king gan fro the bord aryse. Phebus hath laft the angle meridional, And yet ascending was the beest royal, The gentil Leon, with his Aldiran, Whan that this Tartre king, this Cambinskan, Roos fro his bord, ther that he sat ful hye. Toforn him gooth the loude minstralcye, Til he cam to his chambre of parements, Ther as they sownen diverse instruments, That it is lyk an heven for to here. Now dauncen lusty Venus children dere, For in the Fish hir lady sat ful hye, And loketh on hem with a freendly yë. This noble king is set up in his trone. This strange knight is fet to him ful sone, And on the daunce he gooth with Canacee. Heer is the revel and the Iolitee That is nat able a dul man to devyse. He moste han knowen love and his servyse, And been a festlich man as fresh as May, That sholde yow devysen swich array. Who coude telle yow the forme of daunces, So uncouthe and so fresshe contenaunces, Swich subtil loking and dissimulinges For drede of Ialouse mennes aperceyvinges? No man but Launcelot, and he is deed. Therefor I passe of al this lustiheed; I seye na-more, but in this Iolynesse I lete hem, til men to the soper dresse. The styward bit the spyces for to hye, And eek the wyn, in al this melodye. The usshers and the squyers ben y-goon; The spyces and the wyn is come anoon. They ete and drinke; and whan this hadde an ende, Un-to the temple, as reson was, they wende. The service doon, they soupen al by day. What nedeth yow rehercen hir array? Ech man wot wel, that at a kinges feeste Hath plentee, to the moste and to the leeste, And deyntees mo than been in my knowing. At-after soper gooth this noble king To seen this hors of bras, with al the route Of lordes and of ladyes him aboute. Swich wondring was ther on this hors of bras That, sin the grete sege of Troye was, Ther-as men wondreden on an hors also, Ne was ther swich a wondring as was tho. But fynally the king axeth this knight The vertu of this courser and the might, And preyede him to telle his governaunce. This hors anoon bigan to trippe and daunce, Whan that this knight leyde hand up-on his reyne, And seyde, ‘sir, ther is na-more to seyne, But, whan yow list to ryden any-where, Ye moten trille a pin, stant in his ere, Which I shall telle yow bitwix vs two. Ye mote nempne him to what place also Or to what contree that yow list to ryde. And whan ye come ther as yow list abyde, Bidde him descende, and trille another pin, For ther-in lyth the effect of al the gin, And he wol doun descende and doon your wille; And in that place he wol abyde stille, Though al the world the contrarie hadde y-swore; He shal nat thennes ben y-drawe ne y-bore. Or, if yow liste bidde him thennes goon, Trille this pin, and he wol vanishe anoon Out of the sighte of every maner wight, And come agayn, be it by day or night, When that yow list to clepen him ageyn In swich a gyse as I shal to yow seyn Bitwixe yow and me, and that ful sone. Ryde whan yow list, ther is na-more to done.’ Enformed whan the king was of that knight, And hath conceyved in his wit aright The maner and the forme of al this thing, Thus glad and blythe, this noble doughty king Repeireth to his revel as biforn. The brydel is un-to the tour y-born, And kept among his Iewels leve and dere. The hors vanisshed, I noot in what manere, Out of hir sighte; ye gete na-more of me. But thus I lete in lust and Iolitee This Cambynskan his lordes festeyinge, Til wel ny the day bigan to springe. Explicit prima pars. Sequitur pars secunda. The norice of digestioun, the slepe, Gan on hem winke, and bad hem taken kepe, That muchel drink and labour wolde han reste; And with a galping mouth hem alle he keste, And seyde, ‘it was tyme to lye adoun, For blood was in his dominacioun; Cherissheth blood, natures freend,’ quod he. They thanken him galpinge, by two, by three, And every wight gan drawe him to his reste, As slepe hem bad; they toke it for the beste. Hir dremes shul nat been y-told for me; Ful were hir hedes of fumositee, That causeth dreem, of which ther nis no charge. They slepen til that it was pryme large, The moste part, but it were Canacee; She was ful mesurable, as wommen be. For of hir fader hadde she take leve To gon to reste, sone after it was eve; Hir liste nat appalled for to be, Nor on the morwe unfestlich for to see; And slepte hir firste sleep, and thanne awook. For swich a Ioye she in hir herte took Both of hir queynte ring and hir mirour, That twenty tyme she changed hir colour; And in hir slepe, right for impressioun Of hir mirour, she hadde a visioun. Wherfore, er that the sonne gan up glyde, She cleped on hir maistresse hir bisyde, And seyde, that hir liste for to ryse. Thise olde wommen that been gladly wyse, As is hir maistresse, answerde hir anoon, And seyde, ‘madame, whider wil ye goon Thus erly? for the folk ben alle on reste.’ ‘I wol,’ quod she, ‘aryse, for me leste No lenger for to slepe, and walke aboute.’ Hir maistresse clepeth wommen a gret route, And up they rysen, wel a ten or twelve; Up ryseth fresshe Canacee hir-selve, As rody and bright as dooth the yonge sonne, That in the Ram is four degrees up-ronne; Noon hyer was he, whan she redy was; And forth she walketh esily a pas, Arrayed after the lusty seson sote Lightly, for to pleye and walke on fote; Nat but with fyve or six of hir meynee; And in a trench, forth in the park, goth she. The vapour, which that fro the erthe glood, Made the sonne to seme rody and brood; But nathelees, it was so fair a sighte That it made alle hir hertes for to lighte, What for the seson and the morweninge, And for the foules that she herde singe; For right anon she wiste what they mente Right by hir song, and knew al hir entente. The knotte, why that every tale is told, If it be taried til that lust be cold Of hem that han it after herkned yore, The savour passeth ever lenger the more, For fulsomnesse of his prolixitee. And by the same reson thinketh me, I sholde to the knotte condescende, And maken of hir walking sone an ende. Amidde a tree fordrye, as whyt as chalk, As Canacee was pleying in hir walk, Ther sat a faucon over hir heed ful hye, That with a pitous voys so gan to crye That all the wode resouned of hir cry. Y-beten hath she hir-self so pitously With bothe hir winges, til the rede blood Ran endelong the tree ther-as she stood. And ever in oon she cryde alwey and shrighte, And with hir beek hir-selven so she prighte, That ther nis tygre, ne noon so cruel beste, That dwelleth either in wode or in foreste That nolde han wept, if that he wepe coude, For sorwe of hir, she shrighte alwey so loude. For ther nas never yet no man on lyve— If that I coude a faucon wel discryve— That herde of swich another of fairnesse, As wel of plumage as of gentillesse Of shap, and al that mighte y-rekened be. A faucon peregryn than semed she Of fremde land; and evermore, as she stood, She swowneth now and now for lakke of blood, Til wel neigh is she fallen fro the tree. This faire kinges doghter, Canacee, That on hir finger bar the queynte ring, Thurgh which she understood wel every thing That any foul may in his ledene seyn, And coude answere him in his ledene ageyn, Hath understonde what this faucon seyde, And wel neigh for the rewthe almost she deyde. And to the tree she gooth ful hastily, And on this faucon loketh pitously, And heeld hir lappe abrood, for wel she wiste The faucon moste fallen fro the twiste, When that it swowned next, for lakke of blood. A longe while to wayten hir she stood Till atte laste she spak in this manere Un-to the hauk, as ye shul after here. ‘What is the cause, if it be for to telle, That ye be in this furial pyne of helle?’ Quod Canacee un-to this hauk above. ‘Is this for sorwe of deeth or los of love? For, as I trowe, thise ben causes two That causen moost a gentil herte wo; Of other harm it nedeth nat to speke. For ye your-self upon your-self yow wreke, Which proveth wel, that either love or drede Mot been encheson of your cruel dede, Sin that I see non other wight yow chace. For love of god, as dooth your-selven grace Or what may ben your help; for west nor eest Ne sey I never er now no brid ne beest That ferde with him-self so pitously. Ye slee me with your sorwe, verraily; I have of yow so gret compassioun. For goddes love, com fro the tree adoun; And, as I am a kinges doghter trewe, If that I verraily the cause knewe Of your disese, if it lay in my might, I wolde amende it, er that it were night, As wisly helpe me gret god of kinde! And herbes shal I right y-nowe y-finde To hele with your hurtes hastily.’ Tho shrighte this faucon more pitously Than ever she dide, and fil to grounde anoon, And lyth aswowne, deed, and lyk a stoon, Til Canacee hath in hir lappe hir take Un-to the tyme she gan of swough awake. And, after that she of hir swough gan breyde, Right in hir haukes ledene thus she seyde:— ‘That pitee renneth sone in gentil herte, Feling his similitude in peynes smerte, Is preved al-day, as men may it see, As wel by werk as by auctoritee; For gentil herte kytheth gentillesse. I see wel, that ye han of my distresse Compassioun, my faire Canacee, Of verray wommanly benignitee That nature in your principles hath set. But for non hope for to fare the bet, But for to obeye un-to your herte free, And for to maken other be war by me, As by the whelp chasted is the leoun, Right for that cause and that conclusioun, Whyl that I have a leyser and a space, Myn harm I wol confessen, er I pace.’ And ever, whyl that oon hir sorwe tolde, That other weep, as she to water wolde, Til that the faucon bad hir to be stille; And, with a syk, right thus she seyde hir wille. ‘Ther I was bred (allas! that harde day!) And fostred in a roche of marbul gray So tendrely, that nothing eyled me, I niste nat what was adversitee, Til I coude flee ful hye under the sky. Tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by, That semed welle of alle gentillesse; Al were he ful of treson and falsnesse, It was so wrapped under humble chere, And under hewe of trouthe in swich manere, Under plesance, and under bisy peyne, That no wight coude han wend he coude feyne, So depe in greyn he dyed his coloures. Right as a serpent hit him under floures Til he may seen his tyme for to byte, Right so this god of love, this ypocryte, Doth so his cerimonies and obeisaunces, And kepeth in semblant alle his observances That sowneth in-to gentillesse of love. As in a toumbe is al the faire above, And under is the corps, swich as ye woot, Swich was this ypocryte, bothe cold and hoot, And in this wyse he served his entente, That (save the feend) non wiste what he mente. Til he so longe had wopen and compleyned, And many a yeer his service to me feyned, Til that myn herte, to pitous and to nyce, Al innocent of his crouned malice, For-fered of his deeth, as thoughte me, Upon his othes and his seuretee, Graunted him love, on this condicioun, That evermore myn honour and renoun Were saved, bothe privee and apert; This is to seyn, that, after his desert, I yaf him al myn herte and al my thoght— God woot and he, that otherwyse noght— And took his herte in chaunge for myn for ay. But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many a day, “A trew wight and a theef thenken nat oon.” And, whan he saugh the thing so fer y-goon, That I had graunted him fully my love, In swich a gyse as I have seyd above, And yeven him my trewe herte, as free As he swoor he his herte yaf to me; Anon this tygre, ful of doublenesse, Fil on his knees with so devout humblesse, With so heigh reverence, and, as by his chere, So lyk a gentil lovere of manere, So ravisshed, as it semed, for the Ioye, That never Iason, ne Parys of Troye, Iason? certes, ne non other man, Sin Lameth was, that alderfirst bigan To loven two, as writen folk biforn, Ne never, sin the firste man was born, Ne coude man, by twenty thousand part, Countrefete the sophimes of his art; Ne were worthy unbokele his galoche, Ther doublenesse or feyning sholde approche, Ne so coude thanke a wight as he did me! His maner was an heven for to see Til any womman, were she never so wys; So peynted he and kembde at point-devys As wel his wordes as his contenaunce. And I so lovede him for his obeisaunce, And for the trouthe I demed in his herte, That, if so were that any thing him smerte, Al were it never so lyte, and I it wiste, Me thoughte, I felte deeth myn herte twiste. And shortly, so ferforth this thing is went, That my wil was his willes instrument; This is to seyn, my wil obeyed his wil In alle thing, as fer as reson fil, Keping the boundes of my worship ever. Ne never hadde I thing so leef, ne lever, As him, god woot! ne never shal na-mo. This lasteth lenger than a yeer or two, That I supposed of him noght but good. But fynally, thus atte laste it stood, That fortune wolde that he moste twinne Out of that place which that I was inne. Wher me was wo, that is no questioun; I can nat make of it discripcioun; For o thing dar I tellen boldely, I knowe what is the peyne of deth ther-by; Swich harm I felte for he ne mighte bileve. So on a day of me he took his leve, So sorwefully eek, that I wende verraily That he had felt as muche harm as I, Whan that I herde him speke, and saugh his hewe. But nathelees, I thoughte he was so trewe, And eek that he repaire sholde ageyn With-inne a litel whyle, sooth to seyn; And reson wolde eek that he moste go For his honour, as ofte it happeth so, That I made vertu of necessitee, And took it wel, sin that it moste be. As I best mighte, I hidde fro him my sorwe, And took him by the hond, seint Iohn to borwe, And seyde him thus: “lo, I am youres al; Beth swich as I to yow have been, and shal.” What he answerde, it nedeth noght reherce, Who can sey bet than he, who can do werse? Whan he hath al wel seyd, thanne hath he doon. “Therfor bihoveth him a ful long spoon That shal ete with a feend,” thus herde I seye. So atte laste he moste forth his weye, And forth he fleeth, til he cam ther him leste. Whan it cam him to purpos for to reste, I trowe he hadde thilke text in minde, That “alle thing, repeiring to his kinde, Gladeth him-self” thus seyn men, as I gesse; Men loven of propre kinde newfangelnesse, As briddes doon that men in cages fede. For though thou night and day take of hem hede, And strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk, And yeve hem sugre, hony, breed and milk, Yet right anon, as that his dore is uppe, He with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe, And to the wode he wol and wormes ete; So newefangel been they of hir mete, And loven novelryes of propre kinde; No gentillesse of blood [ne] may hem binde. So ferde this tercelet, allas the day! Though he were gentil born, and fresh and gay, And goodly for to see, and humble and free, He saugh up-on a tyme a kyte flee, And sodeynly he loved this kyte so, That al his love is clene fro me ago, And hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse; Thus hath the kyte my love in hir servyse, And I am lorn with-outen remedye!’ And with that word this faucon gan to crye, And swowned eft in Canaceës barme. Greet was the sorwe, for the haukes harme, That Canacee and alle hir wommen made; They niste how they mighte the faucon glade. But Canacee hom bereth hir in hir lappe, And softely in plastres gan hir wrappe, Ther as she with hir beek had hurt hir-selve. Now can nat Canacee but herbes delve Out of the grounde, and make salves newe Of herbes precious, and fyne of hewe, To helen with this hauk; fro day to night She dooth hir bisinesse and al hir might. And by hir beddes heed she made a mewe, And covered it with veluëttes blewe, In signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene. And al with-oute, the mewe is peynted grene, In which were peynted alle thise false foules, As beth thise tidifs, tercelets, and oules, Right for despyt were peynted hem bisyde, And pyes, on hem for to crye and chyde. Thus lete I Canacee hir hauk keping; I wol na-more as now speke of hir ring, Til it come eft to purpos for to seyn How that this faucon gat hir love ageyn Repentant, as the storie telleth us, By mediacioun of Cambalus, The kinges sone, of whiche I yow tolde, But hennes-forth I wol my proces holde, To speke of aventures and of batailles, That never yet was herd so grete mervailles. First wol I telle yow of Cambinskan, That in his tyme many a citee wan; And after wol I speke of Algarsyf, How that he wan Theodora to his wyf, For whom ful ofte in greet peril he was, Ne hadde he ben holpen by the stede of bras; And after wol I speke of Cambalo, That faught in listes with the bretheren two For Canacee, er that he mighte hir winne. And ther I lefte I wol ageyn biginne. Explicit secunda pars. Incipit pars tercia.

But, sires, by-cause I am a burel man, At my biginning first I yow biseche Have me excused of my rude speche; I lerned never rethoryk certeyn; Thing that I speke, it moot be bare and pleyn.

In Armorik, that called is Britayne, Ther was a knight that loved and dide his payne To serve a lady in his beste wyse; And many a labour, many a greet empryse He for his lady wroghte, er she were wonne. For she was oon, the faireste under sonne, And eek therto come of so heigh kinrede, That wel unnethes dorste this knight, for drede, Telle hir his wo, his peyne, and his distresse. But atte laste, she, for his worthinesse, And namely for his meke obeysaunce, Hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce, That prively she fil of his accord To take him for hir housbonde and hir lord, Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves; And for to lede the more in blisse hir lyves, Of his free wil he swoor hir as a knight, That never in al his lyf he, day ne night, Ne sholde up-on him take no maistrye Agayn hir wil, ne kythe hir Ialousye, But hir obeye, and folwe hir wil in al As any lovere to his lady shal; Save that the name of soveraynetee, That wolde he have for shame of his degree. She thanked him, and with ful greet humblesse She seyde, ‘sire, sith of your gentillesse Ye profre me to have so large a reyne, Ne wolde never god bitwixe us tweyne, As in my gilt, were outher werre or stryf. Sir, I wol be your humble trewe wyf, Have heer my trouthe, til that myn herte breste.’ Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste. For o thing, sires, saufly dar I seye, That frendes everich other moot obeye, If they wol longe holden companye. Love wol nat ben constreyned by maistrye; Whan maistrie comth, the god of love anon Beteth hise winges, and farewel! he is gon! Love is a thing as any spirit free; Wommen of kinde desiren libertee, And nat to ben constreyned as a thral; And so don men, if I soth seyen shal. Loke who that is most pacient in love, He is at his avantage al above. Pacience is an heigh vertu certeyn; For it venquisseth, as thise clerkes seyn, Thinges that rigour sholde never atteyne. For every word men may nat chyde or pleyne. Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon, Ye shul it lerne, wher-so ye wole or noon. For in this world, certein, ther no wight is, That he ne dooth or seith som-tyme amis. Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun, Wyn, wo, or chaunginge of complexioun Causeth ful ofte to doon amis or speken. On every wrong a man may nat be wreken; After the tyme, moste be temperaunce To every wight that can on governaunce. And therfore hath this wyse worthy knight, To live in ese, suffrance hir bihight, And she to him ful wisly gan to swere That never sholde ther be defaute in here. Heer may men seen an humble wys accord; Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord, Servant in love, and lord in mariage; Than was he bothe in lordship and servage; Servage? nay, but in lordshipe above, Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love; His lady, certes, and his wyf also, The which that lawe of love acordeth to. And whan he was in this prosperitee, Hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree, Nat fer fro Penmark, ther his dwelling was, Wher-as he liveth in blisse and in solas. Who coude telle, but he had wedded be, The Ioye, the ese, and the prosperitee That is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf? A yeer and more lasted this blisful lyf, Til that the knight of which I speke of thus, That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus, Shoop him to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweyne In Engelond, that cleped was eek Briteyne, To seke in armes worship and honour; For al his lust he sette in swich labour; And dwelled ther two yeer, the book seith thus. Now wol I stinte of this Arveragus, And speken I wole of Dorigene his wyf, That loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf. For his absence wepeth she and syketh, As doon thise noble wyves whan hem lyketh. She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth; Desyr of his presence hir so distreyneth, That al this wyde world she sette at noght. Hir frendes, whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght, Conforten hir in al that ever they may; They prechen hir, they telle hir night and day, That causelees she sleeth hir-self, allas! And every confort possible in this cas They doon to hir with al hir bisinesse, Al for to make hir leve hir hevinesse. By proces, as ye knowen everichoon, Men may so longe graven in a stoon, Til som figure ther-inne emprented be. So longe han they conforted hir, til she Receyved hath, by hope and by resoun, The emprenting of hir consolacioun, Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage; She may nat alwey duren in swich rage. And eek Arveragus, in al this care, Hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare, And that he wol come hastily agayn; Or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn. Hir freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake, And preyede hir on knees, for goddes sake, To come and romen hir in companye, Awey to dryve hir derke fantasye. And finally, she graunted that requeste; For wel she saugh that it was for the beste. Now stood hir castel faste by the see, And often with hir freendes walketh she Hir to disporte up-on the bank an heigh, Wher-as she many a ship and barge seigh Seilinge hir cours, wher-as hem liste go; But than was that a parcel of hir wo. For to hir-self ful ofte ‘allas!’ seith she, ‘Is ther no ship, of so manye as I see, Wol bringen hom my lord? than were myn herte Al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte.’ Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thinke, And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brinke. But whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake, For verray fere so wolde hir herte quake, That on hir feet she mighte hir noght sustene. Than wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene, And pitously in-to the see biholde, And seyn right thus, with sorweful sykes colde: ‘Eterne god, that thurgh thy purveyaunce Ledest the world by certein governaunce, In ydel, as men seyn, ye no-thing make; But, lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake, That semen rather a foul confusioun Of werk than any fair creacioun Of swich a parfit wys god and a stable, Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable? For by this werk, south, north, ne west, ne eest, Ther nis y-fostred man, ne brid, ne beest; It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth. See ye nat, lord, how mankinde it destroyeth? An hundred thousand bodies of mankinde Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in minde, Which mankinde is so fair part of thy werk That thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk. Than semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee Toward mankinde; but how than may it be That ye swiche menes make it to destroyen, Whiche menes do no good, but ever anoyen? I woot wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste, By arguments, that al is for the beste, Though I ne can the causes nat y-knowe. But thilke god, that made wind to blowe, As kepe my lord! this my conclusioun; To clerkes lete I al disputisoun. But wolde god that alle thise rokkes blake Were sonken in-to helle for his sake! Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the fere.’ Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous tere. Hir freendes sawe that it was no disport To romen by the see, but disconfort; And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles. They leden hir by riveres and by welles, And eek in othere places delitables; They dauncen, and they pleyen at ches and tables. So on a day, right in the morwe-tyde, Un-to a gardin that was ther bisyde, In which that they had maad hir ordinaunce Of vitaille and of other purveyaunce, They goon and pleye hem al the longe day. And this was on the sixte morwe of May, Which May had peynted with his softe shoures This gardin ful of leves and of floures; And craft of mannes hand so curiously Arrayed hadde this gardin, trewely, That never was ther gardin of swich prys, But-if it were the verray paradys. The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte Wolde han maad any herte for to lighte That ever was born, but-if to gret siknesse, Or to gret sorwe helde it in distresse; So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce. At-after diner gonne they to daunce, And singe also, save Dorigen allone, Which made alwey hir compleint and hir mone; For she ne saugh him on the daunce go, That was hir housbonde and hir love also. But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde, And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde. Up-on this daunce, amonges othere men, Daunced a squyer biforen Dorigen, That fressher was and Iolyer of array, As to my doom, than is the monthe of May. He singeth, daunceth, passinge any man That is, or was, sith that the world bigan. Ther-with he was, if men sholde him discryve, Oon of the beste faringe man on-lyve; Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche and wys, And wel biloved, and holden in gret prys. And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal, Unwiting of this Dorigen at al, This lusty squyer, servant to Venus, Which that y-cleped was Aurelius, Had loved hir best of any creature Two yeer and more, as was his aventure, But never dorste he telle hir his grevaunce; With-outen coppe he drank al his penaunce. He was despeyred, no-thing dorste he seye, Save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye His wo, as in a general compleyning; He seyde he lovede, and was biloved no-thing. Of swich matere made he manye layes, Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes, How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle, But languissheth, as a furie dooth in helle; And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo. In other manere than ye here me seye, Ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye; Save that, paraventure, som-tyme at daunces, Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces, It may wel be he loked on hir face In swich a wyse, as man that asketh grace; But no-thing wiste she of his entente. Nathelees, it happed, er they thennes wente, By-cause that he was hir neighebour, And was a man of worship and honour, And hadde y-knowen him of tyme yore, They fille in speche; and forth more and more Un-to his purpos drough Aurelius, And whan he saugh his tyme, he seyde thus: ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘by god that this world made, So that I wiste it mighte your herte glade, I wolde, that day that your Arveragus Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius, Had went ther never I sholde have come agayn; For wel I woot my service is in vayn. My guerdon is but bresting of myn herte; Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte; For with a word ye may me sleen or save, Heer at your feet god wolde that I were grave! I ne have as now no leyser more to seye; Have mercy, swete, or ye wol do me deye!’ She gan to loke up-on Aurelius: ‘Is this your wil,’ quod she, ‘and sey ye thus? Never erst,’ quod she, ‘ne wiste I what ye mente. But now, Aurelie, I knowe your entente, By thilke god that yaf me soule and lyf, Ne shal I never been untrewe wyf In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit: I wol ben his to whom that I am knit; Tak this for fynal answer as of me.’ But after that in pley thus seyde she: ‘Aurelie,’ quod she, ‘by heighe god above, Yet wolde I graunte yow to been your love, Sin I yow see so pitously complayne; Loke what day that, endelong Britayne, Ye remoeve alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon, That they ne lette ship ne boot to goon— I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so clene Of rokkes, that ther nis no stoon y-sene, Than wol I love yow best of any man; Have heer my trouthe in al that ever I can.’ ‘Is ther non other grace in yow,’ quod he. ‘No, by that lord,’ quod she, ‘that maked me! For wel I woot that it shal never bityde. Lat swiche folies out of your herte slyde. What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyf For to go love another mannes wyf, That hath hir body whan so that him lyketh?’ Aurelius ful ofte sore syketh; Wo was Aurelie, whan that he this herde, And with a sorweful herte he thus answerde: ‘Madame,’ quod he, ‘this were an inpossible! Than moot I dye of sodein deth horrible.’ And with that word he turned him anoon. Tho come hir othere freendes many oon, And in the aleyes romeden up and doun, And no-thing wiste of this conclusioun, But sodeinly bigonne revel newe Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe; For thorisonte hath reft the sonne his light; This is as muche to seye as it was night. And hoom they goon in Ioye and in solas, Save only wrecche Aurelius, allas! He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte; He seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte. Him semed that he felte his herte colde; Up to the hevene his handes he gan holde, And on his knowes bare he sette him doun, And in his raving seyde his orisoun. For verray wo out of his wit he breyde. He niste what he spak, but thus he seyde; With pitous herte his pleynt hath he bigonne Un-to the goddes, and first un-to the sonne: He seyde, ‘Appollo, god and governour Of every plaunte, herbe, tree and flour, That yevest, after thy declinacioun, To ech of hem his tyme and his sesoun, As thyn herberwe chaungeth lowe or hye, Lord Phebus, cast thy merciable yë On wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn. Lo, lord! my lady hath my deeth y-sworn With-oute gilt, but thy benignitee Upon my dedly herte have som pitee! For wel I woot, lord Phebus, if yow lest, Ye may me helpen, save my lady, best. Now voucheth sauf that I may yow devyse How that I may been holpe and in what wyse. Your blisful suster, Lucina the shene, That of the see is chief goddesse and quene, Though Neptunus have deitee in the see, Yet emperesse aboven him is she: Ye knowen wel, lord, that right as hir desyr Is to be quiked and lightned of your fyr, For which she folweth yow ful bisily, Right so the see desyreth naturelly To folwen hir, as she that is goddesse Bothe in the see and riveres more and lesse. Wherfore, lord Phebus, this is my requeste— Do this miracle, or do myn herte breste— That now, next at this opposicioun, Which in the signe shal be of the Leoun, As preyeth hir so greet a flood to bringe, That fyve fadme at the leeste it overspringe The hyeste rokke in Armorik Briteyne; And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne; Than certes to my lady may I seye: “Holdeth your heste, the rokkes been aweye.” Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me; Preye hir she go no faster cours than ye; I seye, preyeth your suster that she go No faster cours than ye thise yeres two. Than shal she been evene atte fulle alway, And spring-flood laste bothe night and day. And, but she vouche-sauf in swiche manere To graunte me my sovereyn lady dere, Prey hir to sinken every rok adoun In-to hir owene derke regioun Under the ground, ther Pluto dwelleth inne, Or never-mo shal I my lady winne. Thy temple in Delphos wol I barefoot seke; Lord Phebus, see the teres on my cheke, And of my peyne have som compassioun.’ And with that word in swowne he fil adoun, And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce. His brother, which that knew of his penaunce, Up caughte him and to bedde he hath him broght. Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght Lete I this woful creature lye; Chese he, for me, whether he wol live or dye. Arveragus, with hele and greet honour, As he that was of chivalrye the flour, Is comen hoom, and othere worthy men. O blisful artow now, thou Dorigen, That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes, The fresshe knight, the worthy man of armes, That loveth thee, as his owene hertes lyf. No-thing list him to been imaginatyf If any wight had spoke, whyl he was oute, To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute. He noght entendeth to no swich matere, But daunceth, Iusteth, maketh hir good chere; And thus in Ioye and blisse I lete hem dwelle, And of the syke Aurelius wol I telle. In langour and in torment furious Two yeer and more lay wrecche Aurelius, Er any foot he mighte on erthe goon; Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon, Save of his brother, which that was a clerk; He knew of al this wo and al this werk. For to non other creature certeyn Of this matere he dorste no word seyn. Under his brest he bar it more secree Than ever dide Pamphilus for Galathee. His brest was hool, with-oute for to sene, But in his herte ay was the arwe kene. And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure In surgerye is perilous the cure, But men mighte touche the arwe, or come therby. His brother weep and wayled prively, Til atte laste him fil in remembraunce, That whyl he was at Orliens in Fraunce, As yonge clerkes, that been likerous To reden artes that been curious, Seken in every halke and every herne Particuler sciences for to lerne, He him remembred that, upon a day, At Orliens in studie a book he say Of magik naturel, which his felawe, That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe, Al were he ther to lerne another craft, Had prively upon his desk y-laft; Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns, Touchinge the eighte and twenty mansiouns That longen to the mone, and swich folye, As in our dayes is nat worth a flye; For holy chirches feith in our bileve Ne suffreth noon illusion us to greve. And whan this book was in his remembraunce, Anon for Ioye his herte gan to daunce, And to him-self he seyde prively: ‘My brother shal be warisshed hastily; For I am siker that ther be sciences, By whiche men make diverse apparences Swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye. For ofte at festes have I wel herd seye, That tregetours, with-inne an halle large, Have maad come in a water and a barge, And in the halle rowen up and doun. Somtyme hath semed come a grim leoun; And somtyme floures springe as in a mede; Somtyme a vyne, and grapes whyte and rede; Somtyme a castel, al of lym and stoon; And whan hem lyked, voyded it anoon. Thus semed it to every mannes sighte. Now than conclude I thus, that if I mighte At Orliens som old felawe y-finde, That hadde this mones mansions in minde, Or other magik naturel above, He sholde wel make my brother han his love. For with an apparence a clerk may make To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes blake Of Britaigne weren y-voyded everichon, And shippes by the brinke comen and gon, And in swich forme endure a day or two; Than were my brother warrished of his wo. Than moste she nedes holden hir biheste, Or elles he shal shame hir atte leste.’ What sholde I make a lenger tale of this? Un-to his brotheres bed he comen is, And swich confort he yaf him for to gon To Orliens, that he up stirte anon, And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare, In hope for to ben lissed of his care. Whan they were come almost to that citee, But-if it were a two furlong or three, A yong clerk rominge by him-self they mette, Which that in Latin thriftily hem grette, And after that he seyde a wonder thing: ‘I knowe,’ quod he, ‘the cause of your coming’; And er they ferther any fote wente, He tolde hem al that was in hir entente. This Briton clerk him asked of felawes The whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes; And he answerde him that they dede were, For which he weep ful ofte many a tere. Doun of his hors Aurelius lighte anon, And forth with this magicien is he gon Hoom to his hous, and made hem wel at ese. Hem lakked no vitaille that mighte hem plese; So wel arrayed hous as ther was oon Aurelius in his lyf saugh never noon. He shewed him, er he wente to sopeer, Forestes, parkes ful of wilde deer; Ther saugh he hertes with hir hornes hye, The gretteste that ever were seyn with yë. He saugh of hem an hondred slayn with houndes, And somme with arwes blede of bittre woundes. He saugh, whan voided were thise wilde deer, Thise fauconers upon a fair river, That with hir haukes han the heron slayn. Tho saugh he knightes Iusting in a playn; And after this, he dide him swich plesaunce, That he him shewed his lady on a daunce On which him-self he daunced, as him thoughte. And whan this maister, that his magik wroughte, Saugh it was tyme, he clapte his handes two, And farewel! al our revel was ago. And yet remoeved they never out of the hous, Whyl they saugh al this sighte merveillous, But in his studie, ther-as his bookes be, They seten stille, and no wight but they three. To him this maister called his squyer, And seyde him thus: ‘is redy our soper? Almost an houre it is, I undertake, Sith I yow bad our soper for to make, Whan that thise worthy men wenten with me In-to my studie, ther-as my bookes be.’ ‘Sire,’ quod this squyer, ‘whan it lyketh yow, It is al redy, though ye wol right now.’ ‘Go we than soupe,’ quod he, ‘as for the beste; This amorous folk som-tyme mote han reste.’ At-after soper fille they in tretee, What somme sholde this maistres guerdon be, To remoeven alle the rokkes of Britayne, And eek from Gerounde to the mouth of Sayne. He made it straunge, and swoor, so god him save, Lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat have, Ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon. Aurelius, with blisful herte anoon, Answerde thus, ‘fy on a thousand pound! This wyde world, which that men seye is round, I wolde it yeve, if I were lord of it. This bargayn is ful drive, for we ben knit. Ye shal be payed trewely, by my trouthe! But loketh now, for no necligence or slouthe, Ye tarie us heer no lenger than to-morwe.’ ‘Nay,’ quod this clerk, ‘have heer my feith to borwe. To bedde is goon Aurelius whan him leste, And wel ny al that night he hadde his reste; What for his labour and his hope of blisse, His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse. Upon the morwe, whan that it was day, To Britaigne toke they the righte way, Aurelius, and this magicien bisyde, And been descended ther they wolde abyde; And this was, as the bokes me remembre, The colde frosty seson of Decembre. Phebus wex old, and hewed lyk latoun, That in his hote declinacioun Shoon as the burned gold with stremes brighte; But now in Capricorn adoun he lighte, Wher-as he shoon ful pale, I dar wel seyn. The bittre frostes, with the sleet and reyn, Destroyed hath the grene in every yerd. Ianus sit by the fyr, with double berd, And drinketh of his bugle-horn the wyn. Biforn him stant braun of the tusked swyn, And “Nowel” cryeth every lusty man. Aurelius, in al that ever he can, Doth to his maister chere and reverence, And preyeth him to doon his diligence To bringen him out of his peynes smerte, Or with a swerd that he wolde slitte his herte. This subtil clerk swich routhe had of this man, That night and day he spedde him that he can, To wayte a tyme of his conclusioun; This is to seye, to make illusioun, By swich an apparence or Iogelrye, I ne can no termes of astrologye, That she and every wight sholde wene and seye, That of Britaigne the rokkes were aweye, Or elles they were sonken under grounde. So atte laste he hath his tyme y-founde To maken his Iapes and his wrecchednesse Of swich a supersticious cursednesse. His tables Toletanes forth he broght, Ful we corrected, ne ther lakked noght, Neither his collect ne his expans yeres, Ne his rotes ne his othere geres, As been his centres and his arguments, And his proporcionels convenients For his equacions in every thing. And, by his eighte spere in his wirking, He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove Fro the heed of thilke fixe Aries above That in the ninthe speere considered is; Ful subtilly he calculed al this. Whan he had founde his firste mansioun, He knew the remenant by proporcioun; And knew the arysing of his mone weel, And in whos face, and terme, and every-deel; And knew ful weel the mones mansioun Acordaunt to his operacioun, And knew also his othere observaunces For swiche illusiouns and swiche meschaunces As hethen folk used in thilke dayes; For which no lenger maked he delayes, But thurgh his magik, for a wyke or tweye, It semed that alle the rokkes were aweye. Aurelius, which that yet despeired is Wher he shal han his love or fare amis, Awaiteth night and day on this miracle; And whan he knew that ther was noon obstacle, That voided were thise rokkes everichon, Doun to his maistres feet he fil anon, And seyde, ‘I woful wrecche, Aurelius, Thanke yow, lord, and lady myn Venus, That me han holpen fro my cares colde:’ And to the temple his wey forth hath he holde, Wher-as he knew he sholde his lady see. And whan he saugh his tyme, anon-right he, With dredful herte and with ful humble chere, Salewed hath his sovereyn lady dere: ‘My righte lady,’ quod this woful man, ‘Whom I most drede and love as I best can, And lothest were of al this world displese, Nere it that I for yow have swich disese, That I moste dyen heer at your foot anon, Noght wolde I telle how me is wo bigon; But certes outher moste I dye or pleyne; Ye slee me giltelees for verray peyne. But of my deeth, thogh that ye have no routhe, Avyseth yow, er that ye breke your trouthe. Repenteth yow, for thilke god above, Er ye me sleen by-cause that I yow love. For, madame, wel ye woot what ye han hight; Nat that I chalange any thing of right Of yow my sovereyn lady, but your grace; But in a gardin yond, at swich a place, Ye woot right wel what ye bihighten me; And in myn hand your trouthe plighten ye To love me best, god woot, ye seyde so, Al be that I unworthy be therto. Madame, I speke it for the honour of yow, More than to save myn hertes lyf right now; I have do so as ye comanded me; And if ye vouche-sauf, ye may go see. Doth as yow list, have your biheste in minde, For quik or deed, right ther ye shul me finde; In yow lyth al, to do me live or deye;— But wel I woot the rokkes been aweye!’ He taketh his leve, and she astonied stood, In al hir face nas a drope of blood; She wende never han come in swich a trappe: ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘that ever this sholde happe! For wende I never, by possibilitee, That swich a monstre or merveille mighte be! It is agayns the proces of nature’: And hoom she gooth a sorweful creature. For verray fere unnethe may she go, She wepeth, wailleth, al a day or two, And swowneth, that it routhe was to see; But why it was, to no wight tolde she; For out of toune was goon Arveragus. But to hir-self she spak, and seyde thus, With face pale and with ful sorweful chere, In hir compleynt, as ye shul after here: ‘Allas,’ quod she, ‘on thee, Fortune, I pleyne, That unwar wrapped hast me in thy cheyne; For which, tescape, woot I no socour Save only deeth or elles dishonour; Oon of thise two bihoveth me to chese. But nathelees, yet have I lever to lese My lyf than of my body have a shame, Or knowe my-selven fals, or lese my name, And with my deth I may be quit, y-wis. Hath ther nat many a noble wyf, er this, And many a mayde y-slayn hir-self, allas! Rather than with hir body doon trespas? Yis, certes, lo, thise stories beren witnesse; Whan thretty tyraunts, ful of cursednesse, Had slayn Phidoun in Athenes, atte feste, They comanded his doghtres for tareste, And bringen hem biforn hem in despyt Al naked, to fulfille hir foul delyt, And in hir fadres blood they made hem daunce Upon the pavement, god yeve hem mischaunce! For which thise woful maydens, ful of drede, Rather than they wolde lese hir maydenhede, They prively ben stirt in-to a welle, And dreynte hem-selven, as the bokes telle. They of Messene lete enquere and seke Of Lacedomie fifty maydens eke, On whiche they wolden doon hir lecherye; But was ther noon of al that companye That she nas slayn, and with a good entente Chees rather for to dye than assente To been oppressed of hir maydenhede. Why sholde I thanne to dye been in drede? Lo, eek, the tiraunt Aristoclides That loved a mayden, heet Stimphalides, Whan that hir fader slayn was on a night, Un-to Dianes temple goth she right, And hente the image in hir handes two, Fro which image wolde she never go. No wight ne mighte hir handes of it arace, Til she was slayn right in the selve place. Now sith that maydens hadden swich despyt To been defouled with mannes foul delyt, Wel oghte a wyf rather hir-selven slee Than be defouled, as it thinketh me. What shal I seyn of Hasdrubales wyf, That at Cartage birafte hir-self hir lyf? For whan she saugh that Romayns wan the toun, She took hir children alle, and skipte adoun In-to the fyr, and chees rather to dye Than any Romayn dide hir vileinye. Hath nat Lucresse y-slayn hir-self, allas! At Rome, whanne she oppressed was Of Tarquin, for hir thoughte it was a shame To liven whan she hadde lost hir name? The sevene maydens of Milesie also Han slayn hem-self, for verray drede and wo, Rather than folk of Gaule hem sholde oppresse. Mo than a thousand stories, as I gesse, Coude I now telle as touchinge this matere. Whan Habradate was slayn, his wyf so dere Hirselven slow, and leet hir blood to glyde In Habradates woundes depe and wyde, And seyde, “my body, at the leeste way, Ther shal no wight defoulen, if I may.” What sholde I mo ensamples heer-of sayn, Sith that so manye han hem-selven slayn Wel rather than they wolde defouled be? I wol conclude, that it is bet for me To sleen my-self, than been defouled thus. I wol be trewe un-to Arveragus, Or rather sleen my-self in som manere, As dide Demociones doghter dere, By-cause that she wolde nat defouled be. O Cedasus! it is ful greet pitee, To reden how thy doghtren deyde, allas! That slowe hem-selven for swich maner cas. As greet a pitee was it, or wel more, The Theban mayden, that for Nichanore Hir-selven slow, right for swich maner wo. Another Theban mayden dide right so; For oon of Macedoine hadde hir oppressed, She with hir deeth hir maydenhede redressed. What shal I seye of Nicerates wyf, That for swich cas birafte hir-self hir lyf? How trewe eek was to Alcebiades His love, that rather for to dyen chees Than for to suffre his body unburied be! Lo which a wyf was Alceste,’ quod she. ‘What seith Omer of gode Penalopee? Al Grece knoweth of hir chastitee. Pardee, of Laodomya is writen thus, That whan at Troye was slayn Protheselaus, No lenger wolde she live after his day. The same of noble Porcia telle I may; With-oute Brutus coude she nat live, To whom she hadde al hool hir herte yive. The parfit wyfhod of Arthemesye Honoured is thurgh al the Barbarye. O Teuta, queen! thy wyfly chastitee To alle wyves may a mirour be. The same thing I seye of Bilia, Of Rodogone, and eek Valeria.’ Thus pleyned Dorigene a day or tweye, Purposinge ever that she wolde deye. But nathelees, upon the thridde night, Hom cam Arveragus, this worthy knight, And asked hir, why that she weep so sore? And she gan wepen ever lenger the more. ‘Allas!’ quod she, ‘that ever was I born! Thus have I seyd,’ quod she, ‘thus have I sworn’— And told him al as ye han herd bifore; It nedeth nat reherce it yow na-more. This housbond with glad chere, in freendly wyse, Answerde and seyde as I shal yow devyse: ‘Is ther oght elles, Dorigen, but this?’ ‘Nay, nay,’ quod she, ‘god help me so, as wis; This is to muche, and it were goddes wille.’ ‘Ye, wyf,’ quod he, ‘lat slepen that is stille; It may be wel, paraventure, yet to-day. Ye shul your trouthe holden, by my fay! For god so wisly have mercy on me, I hadde wel lever y-stiked for to be, For verray love which that I to yow have, But-if ye sholde your trouthe kepe and save. Trouthe is the hyeste thing that man may kepe’:— But with that word he brast anon to wepe, And seyde, ‘I yow forbede, up peyne of deeth, That never, whyl thee lasteth lyf ne breeth, To no wight tel thou of this aventure. As I may best, I wol my wo endure, Ne make no contenance of hevinesse, That folk of yow may demen harm or gesse.’ And forth he cleped a squyer and a mayde: ‘Goth forth anon with Dorigen,’ he sayde, ‘And bringeth hir to swich a place anon.’ They take hir leve, and on hir wey they gon; But they ne wiste why she thider wente. He nolde no wight tellen his entente. Paraventure an heep of yow, y-wis, Wol holden him a lewed man in this, That he wol putte his wyf in Iupartye; Herkneth the tale, er ye up-on hir crye. She may have bettre fortune than yow semeth; And whan that ye han herd the tale, demeth. This squyer, which that highte Aurelius, On Dorigen that was so amorous, Of aventure happed hir to mete Amidde the toun, right in the quikkest strete, As she was boun to goon the wey forth-right Toward the gardin ther-as she had hight. And he was to the gardinward also; For wel he spyed, whan she wolde go Out of hir hous to any maner place. But thus they mette, of aventure or grace; And he saleweth hir with glad entente, And asked of hir whiderward she wente? And she answerde, half as she were mad, ‘Un-to the gardin, as myn housbond bad, My trouthe for to holde, allas! allas!’ Aurelius gan wondren on this cas, And in his herte had greet compassioun Of hir and of hir lamentacioun, And of Arveragus, the worthy knight, That bad hir holden al that she had hight, So looth him was his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe; And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe, Consideringe the beste on every syde, That fro his lust yet were him lever abyde Than doon so heigh a cherlish wrecchednesse Agayns franchyse and alle gentillesse; For which in fewe wordes seyde he thus: ‘Madame, seyth to your lord Arveragus, That sith I see his grete gentillesse To yow, and eek I see wel your distresse, That him were lever han shame (and that were routhe) Than ye to me sholde breke thus your trouthe, I have wel lever ever to suffre wo Than I departe the love bitwix yow two. I yow relesse, madame, in-to your hond Quit every surement and every bond, That ye han maad to me as heer-biforn, Sith thilke tyme which that ye were born. My trouthe I plighte, I shal yow never repreve Of no biheste, and here I take my leve, As of the treweste and the beste wyf That ever yet I knew in al my lyf. But every wyf be-war of hir biheste, On Dorigene remembreth atte leste. Thus can a squyer doon a gentil dede, As well as can a knight, with-outen drede.’ She thonketh him up-on hir knees al bare, And hoom un-to hir housbond is she fare, And tolde him al as ye han herd me sayd; And be ye siker, he was so weel apayd, That it were inpossible me to wryte; What sholde I lenger of this cas endyte? Arveragus and Dorigene his wyf In sovereyn blisse leden forth hir lyf. Never eft ne was ther angre hem bitwene; He cherisseth hir as though she were a quene; And she was to him trewe for evermore. Of thise two folk ye gete of me na-more. Aurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn, Curseth the tyme that ever he was born: ‘Allas,’ quod he, ‘allas! that I bihighte Of pured gold a thousand pound of wighte Un-to this philosophre! how shal I do? I see na-more but that I am fordo. Myn heritage moot I nedes selle, And been a begger; heer may I nat dwelle, And shamen al my kinrede in this place, But I of him may gete bettre grace. But nathelees, I wol of him assaye, At certeyn dayes, yeer by yeer, to paye, And thanke him of his grete curteisye; My trouthe wol I kepe, I wol nat lye.’ With herte soor he gooth un-to his cofre, And broghte gold un-to this philosophre, The value of fyve hundred pound, I gesse, And him bisecheth, of his gentillesse, To graunte him dayes of the remenaunt, And seyde, ‘maister, I dar wel make avaunt, I failled never of my trouthe as yit; For sikerly my dette shal be quit Towardes yow, how-ever that I fare To goon a-begged in my kirtle bare. But wolde ye vouche-sauf, up-on seurtee, Two yeer or three for to respyten me, Than were I wel; for elles moot I selle Myn heritage; ther is na-more to telle.’ This philosophre sobrely answerde, And seyde thus, whan he thise wordes herde: ‘Have I nat holden covenant un-to thee?’ ‘Yes, certes, wel and trewely,’ quod he. ‘Hastow nat had thy lady as thee lyketh?’ ‘No, no,’ quod he, and sorwefully he syketh. ‘What was the cause? tel me if thou can.’ Aurelius his tale anon bigan, And tolde him al, as ye han herd bifore; It nedeth nat to yow reherce it more. He seide, ‘Arveragus, of gentillesse, Had lever dye in sorwe and in distresse Than that his wyf were of hir trouthe fals.’ The sorwe of Dorigen he tolde him als, How looth hir was to been a wikked wyf, And that she lever had lost that day hir lyf, And that hir trouthe she swoor, thurgh innocence: ‘She never erst herde speke of apparence; That made me han of hir so greet pitee. And right as frely as he sente hir me, As frely sente I hir to him ageyn. This al and som, ther is na-more to seyn.’ This philosophre answerde, ‘leve brother, Everich of yow dide gentilly til other. Thou art a squyer, and he is a knight; But god forbede, for his blisful might, But-if a clerk coude doon a gentil dede As wel as any of yow, it is no drede! Sire, I relesse thee thy thousand pound, As thou right now were cropen out of the ground, Ne never er now ne haddest knowen me. For sire, I wol nat take a peny of thee For al my craft, ne noght for my travaille. Thou hast y-payed wel for my vitaille; It is y-nogh, and farewel, have good day:’ And took his hors, and forth he gooth his way. Lordinges, this question wolde I aske now, Which was the moste free, as thinketh yow? Now telleth me, er that ye ferther wende. I can na-more, my tale is at an ende. Here is ended the Frankeleyns Tale. GROUP G. THE SECONDE NONNES TALE. The Prologe of the Seconde Nonnes Tale. The ministre and the norice un-to vyces, Which that men clepe in English ydelnesse, That porter of the gate is of delyces, To eschue, and by hir contrarie hir oppresse, That is to seyn, by leveful bisinesse, Wel oghten we to doon al our entente, Lest that the feend thurgh ydelnesse us hente. For he, that with his thousand cordes slye Continuelly us waiteth to biclappe, Whan he may man in ydelnesse espye, He can so lightly cacche him in his trappe, Til that a man be hent right by the lappe, He nis nat war the feend hath him in honde; Wel oughte us werche, and ydelnes withstonde. And though men dradden never for to dye, Yet seen men wel by reson doutelees, That ydelnesse is roten slogardye, Of which ther never comth no good encrees; And seen, that slouthe hir holdeth in a lees Only to slepe, and for to ete and drinke, And to devouren al that othere swinke. And for to putte us fro swich ydelnesse, That cause is of so greet confusioun, I have heer doon my feithful bisinesse, After the legende, in translacioun Right of thy glorious lyf and passioun, Thou with thy gerland wroght of rose and lilie; Thee mene I, mayde and martir, seint Cecilie! Inuocacio ad Mariam. And thou that flour of virgines art alle, Of whom that Bernard list so wel to wryte, To thee at my biginning first I calle; Thou comfort of us wrecches, do me endyte Thy maydens deeth, that wan thurgh hir meryte The eternal lyf, and of the feend victorie, As man may after reden in hir storie. Thou mayde and mooder, doghter of thy sone, Thou welle of mercy, sinful soules cure, In whom that god, for bountee, chees to wone, Thou humble, and heigh over every creature, Thou nobledest so ferforth our nature, That no desdeyn the maker hadde of kinde, His sone in blode and flesh to clothe and winde. Withinne the cloistre blisful of thy sydes Took mannes shap the eternal love and pees, That of the tryne compas lord and gyde is, Whom erthe and see and heven, out of relees, Ay herien; and thou, virgin wemmelees, Bar of thy body, and dweltest mayden pure, The creatour of every creature. Assembled is in thee magnificence With mercy, goodnesse, and with swich pitee That thou, that art the sonne of excellence, Nat only helpest hem that preyen thee, But ofte tyme, of thy benignitee, Ful frely, er that men thyn help biseche, Thou goost biforn, and art hir lyves leche. Now help, thou meke and blisful fayre mayde, Me, flemed wrecche, in this desert of galle; Think on the womman Cananee, that sayde That whelpes eten somme of the crommes alle That from hir lordes table been y-falle; And though that I, unworthy sone of Eve, Be sinful, yet accepte my bileve. And, for that feith is deed with-outen werkes, So for to werken yif me wit and space, That I be quit fro thennes that most derk is! O thou, that art so fayr and ful of grace, Be myn advocat in that heighe place Ther-as withouten ende is songe ‘Osanne,’ Thou Cristes mooder, doghter dere of Anne! And of thy light my soule in prison lighte, That troubled is by the contagioun Of my body, and also by the wighte Of erthly luste and fals affeccioun; O haven of refut, o salvacioun Of hem that been in sorwe and in distresse, Now help, for to my werk I wol me dresse. Yet preye I yow that reden that I wryte, Foryeve me, that I do no diligence This ilke storie subtilly to endyte; For both have I the wordes and sentence Of him that at the seintes reverence The storie wroot, and folwe hir legende, And prey yow, that ye wol my werk amende. Interpretacio nominis Cecilie, quam ponit frater Iacobus Ianuensis in Legenda Aurea. First wolde I yow the name of seint Cecilie Expoune, as men may in hir storie see, It is to seye in English ‘hevenes lilie,’ For pure chastnesse of virginitee; Or, for she whytnesse hadde of honestee, And grene of conscience, and of good fame The sote savour, ‘lilie’ was hir name. Or Cecile is to seye ‘the wey to blinde,’ For she ensample was by good techinge; Or elles Cecile, as I writen finde, Is ioyned, by a maner conioininge Of ‘hevene’ and ‘Lia’; and heer, in figuringe, The ‘heven’ is set for thoght of holinesse, And ‘Lia’ for hir lasting bisinesse. Cecile may eek be seyd in this manere, ‘Wanting of blindnesse,’ for hir grete light Of sapience, and for hir thewes clere; Or elles, lo! this maydens name bright Of ‘hevene’ and ‘leos’ comth, for which by right Men mighte hir wel ‘the heven of peple’ calle, Ensample of gode and wyse werkes alle. For ‘leos’ ‘peple’ in English is to seye, And right as men may in the hevene see The sonne and mone and sterres every weye, Right so men gostly, in this mayden free, Seyen of feith the magnanimitee, And eek the cleernesse hool of sapience, And sondry werkes, brighte of excellence. And right so as thise philosophres wryte That heven is swift and round and eek brenninge, Right so was fayre Cecilie the whyte Ful swift and bisy ever in good werkinge, And round and hool in good perseveringe, And brenning ever in charitee ful brighte; Now have I yow declared what she highte. Explicit. Here biginneth the Seconde Nonnes Tale, of the lyf of Seinte Cecile. This mayden bright Cecilie, as hir lyf seith, Was comen of Romayns, and of noble kinde, And from hir cradel up fostred in the feith Of Crist, and bar his gospel in hir minde; She never cessed, as I writen finde, Of hir preyere, and god to love and drede, Biseking him to kepe hir maydenhede. And when this mayden sholde unto a man Y-wedded be, that was ful yong of age, Which that y-cleped was Valerian, And day was comen of hir mariage, She, ful devout and humble in hir corage, Under hir robe of gold, that sat ful fayre, Had next hir flesh y-clad hir in an heyre. And whyl the organs maden melodye, To god alone in herte thus sang she; ‘O lord, my soule and eek my body gye Unwemmed, lest that I confounded be:’ And, for his love that deyde upon a tree, Every seconde or thridde day she faste, Ay biddinge in hir orisons ful faste. The night cam, and to bedde moste she gon With hir housbonde, as ofte is the manere, And prively to him she seyde anon, ‘O swete and wel biloved spouse dere, Ther is a conseil, and ye wolde it here, Which that right fain I wolde unto yow seye, So that ye swere ye shul me nat biwreye.’ Valerian gan faste unto hir swere, That for no cas, ne thing that mighte be, He sholde never-mo biwreyen here; And thanne at erst to him thus seyde she, ‘I have an angel which that loveth me, That with greet love, wher-so I wake or slepe, Is redy ay my body for to kepe. And if that he may felen, out of drede, That ye me touche or love in vileinye, He right anon wol slee yow with the dede, And in your yowthe thus ye shulden dye; And if that ye in clene love me gye, He wol yow loven as me, for your clennesse, And shewen yow his Ioye and his brightnesse.’ Valerian, corrected as god wolde, Answerde agayn, ‘if I shal trusten thee, Lat me that angel se, and him biholde; And if that it a verray angel be, Than wol I doon as thou hast preyed me; And if thou love another man, for sothe Right with this swerd than wol I slee yow bothe.’ Cecile answerde anon right in this wyse, ‘If that yow list, the angel shul ye see, So that ye trowe on Crist and yow baptyse. Goth forth to Via Apia,’ quod she, ‘That fro this toun ne stant but myles three, And, to the povre folkes that ther dwelle, Sey hem right thus, as that I shal yow telle. Telle hem that I, Cecile, yow to hem sente, To shewen yow the gode Urban the olde, For secree nedes and for good entente. And whan that ye seint Urban han biholde, Telle him the wordes whiche I to yow tolde; And whan that he hath purged yow fro sinne, Thanne shul ye see that angel, er ye twinne.’ Valerian is to the place y-gon, And right as him was taught by his lerninge, He fond this holy olde Urban anon Among the seintes buriels lotinge. And he anon, with-outen taryinge, Dide his message; and whan that he it tolde, Urban for Ioye his hondes gan up holde. The teres from his yën leet he falle— ‘Almighty lord, o Iesu Crist,’ quod he, ‘Sower of chast conseil, herde of us alle, The fruit of thilke seed of chastitee That thou hast sowe in Cecile, tak to thee! Lo, lyk a bisy bee, with-outen gyle, Thee serveth ay thyn owene thral Cecile! For thilke spouse, that she took but now Ful lyk a fiers leoun, she sendeth here, As meke as ever was any lamb, to yow!’ And with that worde, anon ther gan appere An old man, clad in whyte clothes clere, That hadde a book with lettre of golde in honde, And gan biforn Valerian to stonde. Valerian as deed fil doun for drede Whan he him saugh, and he up hente him tho, And on his book right thus he gan to rede— ‘Oo Lord, oo feith, oo god with-outen mo, Oo Cristendom, and fader of alle also, Aboven alle and over al everywhere’— Thise wordes al with gold y-writen were. Whan this was rad, than seyde this olde man, ‘Levestow this thing or no? sey ye or nay.’ ‘I leve al this thing,’ quod Valerian, ‘For sother thing than this, I dar wel say, Under the hevene no wight thinke may.’ Tho vanisshed the olde man, he niste where, And pope Urban him cristened right there. Valerian goth hoom, and fint Cecilie With-inne his chambre with an angel stonde; This angel hadde of roses and of lilie Corones two, the which he bar in honde; And first to Cecile, as I understonde, He yaf that oon, and after gan he take That other to Valerian, hir make. ‘With body clene and with unwemmed thoght Kepeth ay wel thise corones,’ quod he; ‘Fro Paradys to yow have I hem broght, Ne never-mo ne shal they roten be, Ne lese her sote savour, trusteth me; Ne never wight shal seen hem with his yë, But he be chaast and hate vileinyë. And thou, Valerian, for thou so sone Assentedest to good conseil also, Sey what thee list, and thou shalt han thy bone.’ ‘I have a brother,’ quod Valerian tho, ‘That in this world I love no man so. I pray yow that my brother may han grace To knowe the trouthe, as I do in this place.’ The angel seyde, ‘god lyketh thy requeste, And bothe, with the palm of martirdom, Ye shullen come unto his blisful feste.’ And with that word Tiburce his brother com. And whan that he the savour undernom Which that the roses and the lilies caste, With-inne his herte he gan to wondre faste, And seyde, ‘I wondre, this tyme of the yeer, Whennes that sote savour cometh so Of rose and lilies that I smelle heer. For though I hadde hem in myn hondes two, The savour mighte in me no depper go. The sote smel that in myn herte I finde Hath chaunged me al in another kinde.’ Valerian seyde, ‘two corones han we, Snow-whyte and rose-reed, that shynen clere, Whiche that thyn yën han no might to see; And as thou smellest hem thurgh my preyere, So shaltow seen hem, leve brother dere, If it so be thou wolt, withouten slouthe, Bileve aright and knowen verray trouthe.’ Tiburce answerde, ‘seistow this to me In soothnesse, or in dreem I herkne this?’ ‘In dremes,’ quod Valerian, ‘han we be Unto this tyme, brother myn, y-wis. But now at erst in trouthe our dwelling is.’ ‘How woostow this,’ quod Tiburce, ‘in what wyse?’ Quod Valerian, ‘that shal I thee devyse. The angel of god hath me the trouthe y-taught Which thou shalt seen, if that thou wolt reneye The ydoles and be clene, and elles naught.’— And of the miracle of thise corones tweye Seint Ambrose in his preface list to seye; Solempnely this noble doctour dere Commendeth it, and seith in this manere: The palm of martirdom for to receyve, Seinte Cecile, fulfild of goddes yifte, The world and eek hir chambre gan she weyve; Witnes Tyburces and Valerians shrifte, To whiche god of his bountee wolde shifte Corones two of floures wel smellinge, And made his angel hem the corones bringe: The mayde hath broght thise men to blisse above; The world hath wist what it is worth, certeyn, Devocioun of chastitee to love.— Tho shewede him Cecile al open and pleyn That alle ydoles nis but a thing in veyn; For they been dombe, and therto they been deve, And charged him his ydoles for to leve. ‘Who so that troweth nat this, a beste he is,’ Quod tho Tiburce, ‘if that I shal nat lye.’ And she gan kisse his brest, that herde this, And was ful glad he coude trouthe espye. ‘This day I take thee for myn allye,’ Seyde this blisful fayre mayde dere; And after that she seyde as ye may here: ‘Lo, right so as the love of Crist,’ quod she, ‘Made me thy brotheres wyf, right in that wyse Anon for myn allye heer take I thee, Sin that thou wolt thyn ydoles despyse. Go with thy brother now, and thee baptyse, And make thee clene; so that thou mowe biholde The angels face of which thy brother tolde.’ Tiburce answerde and seyde, ‘brother dere, First tel me whider I shal, and to what man?’ ‘To whom?’ quod he, ‘com forth with right good chere, I wol thee lede unto the pope Urban.’ ‘Til Urban? brother myn Valerian,’ Quod tho Tiburce, ‘woltow me thider lede? Me thinketh that it were a wonder dede. Ne menestow nat Urban,’ quod he tho, ‘That is so ofte dampned to be deed, And woneth in halkes alwey to and fro, And dar nat ones putte forth his heed? Men sholde him brennen in a fyr so reed If he were founde, or that men mighte him spye; And we also, to bere him companye— And whyl we seken thilke divinitee That is y-hid in hevene prively, Algate y-brend in this world shul we be!’ To whom Cecile answerde boldely, ‘Men mighten dreden wel and skilfully This lyf to lese, myn owene dere brother, If this were livinge only and non other. But ther is better lyf in other place, That never shal be lost, ne drede thee noght, Which goddes sone us tolde thurgh his grace; That fadres sone hath alle thinges wroght; And al that wroght is with a skilful thoght, The goost, that fro the fader gan procede, Hath sowled hem, withouten any drede. By word and by miracle goddes sone, Whan he was in this world, declared here That ther was other lyf ther men may wone.’ To whom answerde Tiburce, ‘o suster dere, Ne seydestow right now in this manere, Ther nis but o god, lord in soothfastnesse; And now of three how maystow bere witnesse?’ ‘That shal I telle,’ quod she, ‘er I go. Right as a man hath sapiences three, Memorie, engyn, and intellect also, So, in o being of divinitee, Three persones may ther right wel be.’ Tho gan she him ful bisily to preche Of Cristes come and of his peynes teche, And many pointes of his passioun; How goddes sone in this world was withholde, To doon mankinde pleyn remissioun, That was y-bounde in sinne and cares colde: Al this thing she unto Tiburce tolde. And after this Tiburce, in good entente, With Valerian to pope Urban he wente, That thanked god; and with glad herte and light He cristned him, and made him in that place Parfit in his lerninge, goddes knight. And after this Tiburce gat swich grace, That every day he saugh, in tyme and space, The angel of god; and every maner bone That he god axed, it was sped ful sone. It were ful hard by ordre for to seyn How many wondres Iesus for hem wroghte; But atte laste, to tellen short and pleyn, The sergeants of the toun of Rome hem soghte, And hem biforn Almache the prefect broghte, Which hem apposed, and knew al hir entente, And to the image of Iupiter hem sente, And seyde, ‘who so wol nat sacrifyse, Swap of his heed, this is my sentence here.’ Anon thise martirs that I yow devyse, Oon Maximus, that was an officere Of the prefectes and his corniculere, Hem hente; and whan he forth the seintes ladde, Him-self he weep, for pitee that he hadde. Whan Maximus had herd the seintes lore, He gat him of the tormentoures leve, And ladde hem to his hous withoute more; And with hir preching, er that it were eve, They gonnen fro the tormentours to reve, And fro Maxime, and fro his folk echone The false feith, to trowe in god allone. Cecilie cam, whan it was woxen night, With preestes that hem cristned alle y-fere; And afterward, whan day was woxen light, Cecile hem seyde with a ful sobre chere, ‘Now, Cristes owene knightes leve and dere, Caste alle awey the werkes of derknesse, And armeth yow in armure of brightnesse. Ye han for sothe y-doon a greet bataille, Your cours is doon, your feith han ye conserved, Goth to the corone of lyf that may nat faille; The rightful Iuge, which that ye han served, Shall yeve it yow, as ye han it deserved.’ And whan this thing was seyd as I devyse, Men ladde hem forth to doon the sacrifyse. But whan they weren to the place broght, To tellen shortly the conclusioun, They nolde encense ne sacrifice right noght, But on hir knees they setten hem adoun With humble herte and sad devocioun, And losten bothe hir hedes in the place. Hir soules wenten to the king of grace. This Maximus, that saugh this thing bityde, With pitous teres tolde it anon-right, That he hir soules saugh to heven glyde With angels ful of cleernesse and of light, And with his word converted many a wight; For which Almachius dide him so to-bete With whippe of leed, til he his lyf gan lete. Cecile him took and buried him anoon By Tiburce and Valerian softely, Withinne hir burying-place, under the stoon. And after this Almachius hastily Bad his ministres fecchen openly Cecile, so that she mighte in his presence Doon sacrifyce, and Iupiter encense. But they, converted at hir wyse lore, Wepten ful sore, and yaven ful credence Unto hir word, and cryden more and more, ‘Crist, goddes sone withouten difference, Is verray god, this is al our sentence, That hath so good a servant him to serve; This with o voys we trowen, thogh we sterve!’ Almachius, that herde of this doinge, Bad fecchen Cecile, that he might hir see, And alderfirst, lo! this was his axinge, ‘What maner womman artow?’ tho quod he. ‘I am a gentil womman born,’ quod she. ‘I axe thee,’ quod he, ‘thogh it thee greve, Of thy religioun and of thy bileve.’ ‘Ye han bigonne your question folily,’ Quod she, ‘that wolden two answeres conclude In oo demande; ye axed lewedly.’ Almache answerde unto that similitude, ‘Of whennes comth thyn answering so rude?’ ‘Of whennes?’ quod she, whan that she was freyned, ‘Of conscience and of good feith unfeyned.’ Almachius seyde, ‘ne takestow non hede Of my power?’ and she answerde him this— ‘Your might,’ quod she, ‘ful litel is to drede; For every mortal mannes power nis But lyk a bladdre, ful of wind, y-wis. For with a nedles poynt, whan it is blowe, May al the boost of it be leyd ful lowe.’ ‘Ful wrongfully bigonne thou,’ quod he, ‘And yet in wrong is thy perseveraunce; Wostow nat how our mighty princes free Han thus comanded and maad ordinaunce, That every cristen wight shal han penaunce But-if that he his cristendom withseye, And goon al quit, if he wol it reneye?’ ‘Your princes erren, as your nobley dooth,’ Quod tho Cecile, ‘and with a wood sentence Ye make us gilty, and it is nat sooth; For ye, that knowen wel our innocence, For as muche as we doon a reverence To Crist, and for we bere a cristen name, Ye putte on us a cryme, and eek a blame. But we that knowen thilke name so For vertuous, we may it nat withseye.’ Almache answerde, ‘chees oon of thise two, Do sacrifyce, or cristendom reneye, That thou mowe now escapen by that weye.’ At which the holy blisful fayre mayde Gan for to laughe, and to the Iuge seyde, ‘O Iuge, confus in thy nycetee, Woltow that I reneye innocence, To make me a wikked wight?’ quod she; ‘Lo! he dissimuleth here in audience, He stareth and woodeth in his advertence!’ To whom Almachius, ‘unsely wrecche, Ne woostow nat how far my might may strecche? Han noght our mighty princes to me yeven, Ye, bothe power and auctoritee To maken folk to dyen or to liven? Why spekestow so proudly than to me?’ ‘I speke noght but stedfastly,’ quod she, ‘Nat proudly, for I seye, as for my syde, We haten deedly thilke vyce of pryde. And if thou drede nat a sooth to here, Than wol I shewe al openly, by right, That thou hast maad a ful gret lesing here. Thou seyst, thy princes han thee yeven might Bothe for to sleen and for to quiken a wight; Thou, that ne mayst but only lyf bireve, Thou hast non other power ne no leve! But thou mayst seyn, thy princes han thee maked Ministre of deeth; for if thou speke of mo, Thou lyest, for thy power is ful naked.’ ‘Do wey thy boldnes,’ seyde Almachius tho, ‘And sacrifyce to our goddes, er thou go; I recche nat what wrong that thou me profre, For I can suffre it as a philosophre; But thilke wronges may I nat endure That thou spekest of our goddes here,’ quod he. Cecile answerede, ‘o nyce creature, Thou seydest no word sin thou spak to me That I ne knew therwith thy nycetee; And that thou were, in every maner wyse, A lewed officer and a veyn Iustyse. Ther lakketh no-thing to thyn utter yën That thou nart blind, for thing that we seen alle That it is stoon, that men may wel espyen, That ilke stoon a god thou wolt it calle. I rede thee, lat thyn hand upon it falle, And taste it wel, and stoon thou shalt it finde, Sin that thou seest nat with thyn yën blinde. It is a shame that the peple shal So scorne thee, and laughe at thy folye; For comunly men woot it wel overal, That mighty god is in his hevenes hye, And thise images, wel thou mayst espye, To thee ne to hem-self mowe nought profyte, For in effect they been nat worth a myte.’ Thise wordes and swiche othere seyde she, And he weex wroth, and bad men sholde hir lede Hom til hir hous, ‘and in hir hous,’ quod he, ‘Brenne hir right in a bath of flambes rede.’ And as he bad, right so was doon in dede; For in a bath they gonne hir faste shetten, And night and day greet fyr they under betten. The longe night and eek a day also, For al the fyr and eek the bathes hete, She sat al cold, and felede no wo, It made hir nat a drope for to swete. But in that bath hir lyf she moste lete; For he, Almachius, with ful wikke entente To sleen hir in the bath his sonde sente. Three strokes in the nekke he smoot hir tho, The tormentour, but for no maner chaunce He mighte noght smyte al hir nekke a-two; And for ther was that tyme an ordinaunce, That no man sholde doon man swich penaunce The ferthe strook to smyten, softe or sore, This tormentour ne dorste do na-more. But half-deed, with hir nekke y-corven there, He lefte hir lye, and on his wey is went. The Cristen folk, which that aboute hir were, With shetes han the blood ful faire y-hent. Thre dayes lived she in this torment, And never cessed hem the feith to teche; That she hadde fostred, hem she gan to preche; And hem she yaf hir moebles and hir thing, And to the pope Urban bitook hem tho, And seyde, ‘I axed this at hevene king, To han respyt three dayes and na-mo, To recomende to yow, er that I go, Thise soules, lo! and that I mighte do werche Here of myn hous perpetuelly a cherche.’ Seint Urban, with his deknes, prively The body fette, and buried it by nighte Among his othere seintes honestly. Hir hous the chirche of seint Cecilie highte; Seint Urban halwed it, as he wel mighte; In which, into this day, in noble wyse, Men doon to Crist and to his seint servyse. Here is ended the Seconde Nonnes Tale. THE CANON'S YEOMAN'S PROLOGUE. The prologe of the Chanons Yemannes Tale. Whan ended was the lyf of seint Cecyle, Er we had riden fully fyve myle, At Boghton under Blee us gan atake A man, that clothed was in clothes blake, And undernethe he hadde a whyt surplys. His hakeney, that was al pomely grys, So swatte, that it wonder was to see; It semed he had priked myles three. The hors eek that his yeman rood upon So swatte, that unnethe mighte it gon. Aboute the peytrel stood the foom ful hye, He was of fome al flekked as a pye. A male tweyfold on his croper lay, It semed that he caried lyte array. Al light for somer rood this worthy man, And in myn herte wondren I bigan What that he was, til that I understood How that his cloke was sowed to his hood; For which, when I had longe avysed me, I demed him som chanon for to be. His hat heng at his bak doun by a laas, For he had riden more than trot or paas; He had ay priked lyk as he were wood. A clote-leef he hadde under his hood For swoot, and for to kepe his heed from hete. But it was Ioye for to seen him swete! His forheed dropped as a stillatorie, Were ful of plantain and of paritorie. And whan that he was come, he gan to crye, ‘God save,’ quod he, ‘this Ioly companye! Faste have I priked,’ quod he, ‘for your sake, By-cause that I wolde yow atake, To ryden in this mery companye.’ His yeman eek was ful of curteisye, And seyde, ‘sires, now in the morwe-tyde Out of your hostelrye I saugh you ryde, And warned heer my lord and my soverayn, Which that to ryden with yow is ful fayn, For his desport; he loveth daliaunce.’ ‘Freend, for thy warning god yeve thee good chaunce,’ Than seyde our host, ‘for certes, it wolde seme Thy lord were wys, and so I may wel deme; He is ful Iocund also, dar I leye. Can he oght telle a mery tale or tweye, With which he glade may this companye?’ ‘Who, sire? my lord? ye, ye, withouten lye, He can of murthe, and eek of Iolitee Nat but ynough; also sir, trusteth me, And ye him knewe as wel as do I, Ye wolde wondre how wel and craftily He coude werke, and that in sondry wyse. He hath take on him many a greet empryse, Which were ful hard for any that is here To bringe aboute, but they of him it lere. As homely as he rit amonges yow, If ye him knewe, it wolde be for your prow; Ye wolde nat forgoon his aqueyntaunce For mochel good, I dar leye in balaunce Al that I have in my possessioun. He is a man of heigh discrecioun, I warne you wel, he is a passing man.’ ‘Wel,’ quod our host, ‘I pray thee, tel me than, Is he a clerk, or noon? tel what he is.’ ‘Nay, he is gretter than a clerk, y-wis,’ Seyde this yeman, ‘and in wordes fewe, Host, of his craft som-what I wol yow shewe. I seye, my lord can swich subtilitee— (But al his craft ye may nat wite at me; And som-what helpe I yet to his werking)— That al this ground on which we been ryding, Til that we come to Caunterbury toun, He coude al clene turne it up-so-doun, And pave it al of silver and of gold.’ And whan this yeman hadde thus y-told Unto our host, he seyde, ‘benedicite! This thing is wonder merveillous to me, Sin that thy lord is of so heigh prudence, By-cause of which men sholde him reverence, That of his worship rekketh he so lyte; His oversloppe nis nat worth a myte, As in effect, to him, so mote I go! It is al baudy and to-tore also. Why is thy lord so sluttish, I thee preye, And is of power better cloth to beye, If that his dede accorde with thy speche? Telle me that, and that I thee biseche.’ ‘Why?’ quod this yeman, ‘wherto axe ye me? God help me so, for he shal never thee! (But I wol nat avowe that I seye, And therfor kepe it secree, I yow preye). He is to wys, in feith, as I bileve; That that is overdoon, it wol nat preve Aright, as clerkes seyn, it is a vyce. Wherfor in that I holde him lewed and nyce. For whan a man hath over-greet a wit, Ful oft him happeth to misusen it; So dooth my lord, and that me greveth sore. God it amende, I can sey yow na-more.’ ‘Ther-of no fors, good yeman,’ quod our host; ‘Sin of the conning of thy lord thou wost, Tel how he dooth, I pray thee hertely, Sin that he is so crafty and so sly. Wher dwellen ye, if it to telle be?’ ‘In the suburbes of a toun,’ quod he, ‘Lurkinge in hernes and in lanes blinde, Wher-as thise robbours and thise theves by kinde Holden hir privee fereful residence, As they that dar nat shewen hir presence; So faren we, if I shal seye the sothe.’ ‘Now,’ quod our host, ‘yit lat me talke to the; Why artow so discoloured of thy face?’ ‘Peter!’ quod he, ‘god yeve it harde grace, I am so used in the fyr to blowe, That it hath chaunged my colour, I trowe. I am nat wont in no mirour to prye, But swinke sore and lerne multiplye. We blondren ever and pouren in the fyr, And for al that we fayle of our desyr, For ever we lakken our conclusioun. To mochel folk we doon illusioun, And borwe gold, be it a pound or two, Or ten, or twelve, or many sommes mo, And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye, That of a pound we coude make tweye! Yet is it fals, but ay we han good hope It for to doon, and after it we grope. But that science is so fer us biforn, We mowen nat, al-though we hadde it sworn, It overtake, it slit awey so faste; It wol us maken beggers atte laste.’ Whyl this yeman was thus in his talking, This chanoun drough him neer, and herde al thing Which this yeman spak, for suspecioun Of mennes speche ever hadde this chanoun. For Catoun seith, that he that gilty is Demeth al thing be spoke of him, y-wis. That was the cause he gan so ny him drawe To his yeman, to herknen al his sawe. And thus he seyde un-to his yeman tho, ‘Hold thou thy pees, and spek no wordes mo, For if thou do, thou shalt it dere abye; Thou sclaundrest me heer in this companye, And eek discoverest that thou sholdest hyde.’ ‘Ye,’ quod our host, ‘telle on, what so bityde; Of al his threting rekke nat a myte!’ ‘In feith,’ quod he, ‘namore I do but lyte.’ And whan this chanon saugh it wolde nat be, But his yeman wolde his privetee, He fledde awey for verray sorwe and shame. ‘A!’ quod the yeman, ‘heer shal aryse game, Al that I can anon now wol I telle. Sin he is goon, the foule feend him quelle! For never her-after wol I with him mete For peny ne for pound, I yow bihete! He that me broghte first unto that game, Er that he dye, sorwe have he and shame! For it is ernest to me, by my feith; That fele I wel, what so any man seith. And yet, for al my smert and al my grief, For al my sorwe, labour, and meschief, I coude never leve it in no wyse. Now wolde god my wit mighte suffyse To tellen al that longeth to that art! But natheles yow wol I tellen part; Sin that my lord is gon, I wol nat spare; Swich thing as that I knowe, I wol declare.— Here endeth the Prologe of the Chanouns Yemannes Tale. THE CHANOUNS YEMANNES TALE. Here biginneth the Chanouns Yeman his Tale. [Prima pars.] With this chanoun I dwelt have seven yeer, And of his science am I never the neer. Al that I hadde, I have y-lost ther-by; And god wot, so hath many mo than I. Ther I was wont to be right fresh and gay Of clothing and of other good array, Now may I were an hose upon myn heed; And wher my colour was bothe fresh and reed, Now is it wan and of a leden hewe; Who-so it useth, sore shal he rewe. And of my swink yet blered is myn yë, Lo! which avantage is to multiplye! That slyding science hath me maad so bare, That I have no good, wher that ever I fare; And yet I am endetted so ther-by Of gold that I have borwed, trewely, That whyl I live, I shal it quyte never. Lat every man be war by me for ever! What maner man that casteth him ther-to, If he continue, I holde his thrift y-do. So helpe me god, ther-by shal he nat winne, But empte his purs, and make his wittes thinne. And whan he, thurgh his madnes and folye, Hath lost his owene good thurgh Iupartye, Thanne he excyteth other folk ther-to, To lese hir good as he him-self hath do. For unto shrewes Ioye it is and ese To have hir felawes in peyne and disese; Thus was I ones lerned of a clerk. Of that no charge, I wol speke of our werk. Whan we been ther as we shul exercyse Our elvish craft, we semen wonder wyse, Our termes been so clergial and so queynte. I blowe the fyr til that myn herte feynte. What sholde I tellen ech proporcioun Of thinges whiche that we werche upon, As on fyve or sixe ounces, may wel be, Of silver or som other quantite, And bisie me to telle yow the names Of orpiment, brent bones, yren squames, That into poudre grounden been ful smal? And in an erthen potte how put is al, And salt y-put in, and also papeer, Biforn thise poudres that I speke of heer, And wel y-covered with a lampe of glas, And mochel other thing which that ther was? And of the pot and glasses enluting, That of the eyre mighte passe out no-thing? And of the esy fyr and smart also, Which that was maad, and of the care and wo That we hadde in our matires sublyming, And in amalgaming and calcening Of quik-silver, y-clept Mercurie crude? For alle our sleightes we can nat conclude. Our orpiment and sublymed Mercurie, Our grounden litarge eek on the porphurie, Of ech of thise of ounces a certeyn Nought helpeth us, our labour is in veyn. Ne eek our spirites ascencioun, Ne our materes that lyen al fixe adoun, Mowe in our werking no-thing us avayle. For lost is al our labour and travayle, And al the cost, a twenty devel weye, Is lost also, which we upon it leye. Ther is also ful many another thing That is unto our craft apertening; Though I by ordre hem nat reherce can, By-cause that I am a lewed man, Yet wol I telle hem as they come to minde, Though I ne can nat sette hem in hir kinde; As bole armoniak, verdegrees, boras, And sondry vessels maad of erthe and glas, Our urinales and our descensories, Violes, croslets, and sublymatories, Cucurbites, and alembykes eek, And othere swiche, dere y-nough a leek. Nat nedeth it for to reherce hem alle, Watres rubifying and boles galle, Arsenik, sal armoniak, and brimstoon; And herbes coude I telle eek many oon, As egremoine, valerian, and lunarie, And othere swiche, if that me liste tarie. Our lampes brenning bothe night and day, To bringe aboute our craft, if that we may. Our fourneys eek of calcinacioun, And of watres albificacioun, Unslekked lym, chalk, and gleyre of an ey, Poudres diverse, asshes, dong, pisse, and cley, Cered pokets, sal peter, vitriole; And divers fyres maad of wode and cole; Sal tartre, alkaly, and sal preparat, And combust materes and coagulat, Cley maad with hors or mannes heer, and oile Of tartre, alum, glas, berm, wort, and argoile, Resalgar, and our materes enbibing; And eek of our materes encorporing, And of our silver citrinacioun, Our cementing and fermentacioun, Our ingottes, testes, and many mo. I wol yow telle, as was me taught also, The foure spirites and the bodies sevene, By ordre, as ofte I herde my lord hem nevene. The firste spirit quik-silver called is, The second orpiment, the thridde, y-wis, Sal armoniak, and the ferthe brimstoon. The bodies sevene eek, lo! hem heer anoon: Sol gold is, and Luna silver we threpe, Mars yren, Mercurie quik-silver we clepe, Saturnus leed, and Iupiter is tin, And Venus coper, by my fader kin! This cursed craft who-so wol exercyse, He shal no good han that him may suffyse; For al the good he spendeth ther-aboute, He lese shal, ther-of have I no doute. Who-so that listeth outen his folye, Lat him come forth, and lerne multiplye; And every man that oght hath in his cofre, Lat him appere, and wexe a philosofre. Ascaunce that craft is so light to lere? Nay, nay, god woot, al be he monk or frere, Preest or chanoun, or any other wight, Though he sitte at his book bothe day and night, In lernyng of this elvish nyce lore, Al is in veyn, and parde, mochel more! To lerne a lewed man this subtiltee, Fy! spek nat ther-of, for it wol nat be; Al conne he letterure, or conne he noon, As in effect, he shal finde it al oon. For bothe two, by my savacioun, Concluden, in multiplicacioun, Y-lyke wel, whan they han al y-do; This is to seyn, they faylen bothe two. Yet forgat I to maken rehersaille Of watres corosif and of limaille, And of bodyes mollificacioun, And also of hir induracioun, Oiles, ablucions, and metal fusible, To tellen al wolde passen any bible That o-wher is; wherfor, as for the beste, Of alle thise names now wol I me reste. For, as I trowe, I have yow told y-nowe To reyse a feend, al loke he never so rowe. A! nay! lat be; the philosophres stoon, Elixir clept, we sechen faste echoon; For hadde we him, than were we siker y-now. But, unto god of heven I make avow, For al our craft, whan we han al y-do, And al our sleighte, he wol nat come us to. He hath y-maad us spenden mochel good, For sorwe of which almost we wexen wood, But that good hope crepeth in our herte, Supposinge ever, though we sore smerte, To be releved by him afterward; Swich supposing and hope is sharp and hard; I warne yow wel, it is to seken ever; That futur temps hath maad men to dissever, In trust ther-of, from al that ever they hadde. Yet of that art they can nat wexen sadde, For unto hem it is a bitter swete; So semeth it; for nadde they but a shete Which that they mighte wrappe hem inne a-night, And a bak to walken inne by day-light, They wolde hem selle and spenden on this craft; They can nat stinte til no-thing be laft. And evermore, wher that ever they goon, Men may hem knowe by smel of brimstoon; For al the world, they stinken as a goot; Her savour is so rammish and so hoot, That, though a man from hem a myle be, The savour wol infecte him, trusteth me; Lo, thus by smelling and threedbare array, If that men liste, this folk they knowe may. And if a man wol aske hem prively, Why they been clothed so unthriftily, They right anon wol rownen in his ere, And seyn, that if that they espyed were, Men wolde hem slee, by-cause of hir science; Lo, thus this folk bitrayen innocence! Passe over this; I go my tale un-to. Er than the pot be on the fyr y-do, Of metals with a certein quantite, My lord hem tempreth, and no man but he— Now he is goon, I dar seyn boldely— For, as men seyn, he can don craftily; Algate I woot wel he hath swich a name, And yet ful ofte he renneth in a blame; And wite ye how? ful ofte it happeth so, The pot to-breketh, and farewel! al is go! Thise metals been of so greet violence, Our walles mowe nat make hem resistence, But if they weren wroght of lym and stoon; They percen so, and thurgh the wal they goon, And somme of hem sinken in-to the ground— Thus han we lost by tymes many a pound— And somme are scatered al the floor aboute, Somme lepe in-to the roof; with-outen doute, Though that the feend noght in our sighte him shewe, I trowe he with us be, that ilke shrewe! In helle wher that he is lord and sire, Nis ther more wo, ne more rancour ne ire. Whan that our pot is broke, as I have sayd, Every man chit, and halt him yvel apayd. Som seyde, it was long on the fyr-making, Som seyde, nay! it was on the blowing; (Than was I fered, for that was myn office); ‘Straw!’ quod the thridde, ‘ye been lewed and nyce, It was nat tempred as it oghte be.’ ‘Nay!’ quod the ferthe, ‘stint, and herkne me; By-cause our fyr ne was nat maad of beech, That is the cause, and other noon, so theech!’ I can nat telle wher-on it was long, But wel I wot greet stryf it was long, ‘What!’ quod my lord, ‘ther is na-more to done, Of thise perils I wol be war eft-sone; I am right siker that the pot was crased. Be as be may, be ye no-thing amased; As usage is, lat swepe the floor as swythe, Plukke up your hertes, and beth gladde and blythe.’ The mullok on an hepe y-sweped was, And on the floor y-cast a canevas, And al this mullok in a sive y-throwe, And sifted, and y-piked many a throwe. ‘Pardee,’ quod oon, ‘somwhat of our metal Yet is ther heer, though that we han nat al. Al-though this thing mishapped have as now, Another tyme it may be wel y-now, Us moste putte our good in aventure; A marchant, parde! may nat ay endure, Trusteth me wel, in his prosperitee; Somtyme his good is drenched in the see, And somtym comth it sauf un-to the londe.’ ‘Pees!’ quod my lord, ‘the next tyme I wol fonde To bringe our craft al in another plyte; And but I do, sirs, lat me han the wyte; Ther was defaute in som-what, wel I woot.’ Another seyde, the fyr was over hoot:— But, be it hoot or cold, I dar seye this, That we concluden evermore amis. We fayle of that which that we wolden have, And in our madnesse evermore we rave. And whan we been togidres everichoon, Every man semeth a Salomon. But al thing which that shyneth as the gold Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told; Ne every appel that is fair at yë Ne is nat good, what-so men clappe or crye. Right so, lo! fareth it amonges us; He that semeth the wysest, by Iesus! Is most fool, whan it cometh to the preef; And he that semeth trewest is a theef; That shul ye knowe, er that I fro yow wende, By that I of my tale have maad an ende. Explicit prima pars. Et sequitur pars secunda. [Secunda pars.] Ther is a chanoun of religioun Amonges us, wolde infecte al a toun, Though it as greet were as was Ninivee, Rome, Alisaundre, Troye, and othere three. His sleightes and his infinit falsnesse Ther coude no man wryten, as I gesse, Thogh that he mighte liven a thousand yeer. In al this world of falshede nis his peer; For in his termes so he wolde him winde, And speke his wordes in so sly a kinde, Whan he commune shal with any wight, That he wol make him doten anon right, But it a feend be, as him-selven is. Ful many a man hath he bigyled er this, And wol, if that he live may a whyle; And yet men ryde and goon ful many a myle Him for to seke and have his aqueyntaunce, Noght knowinge of his false governaunce. And if yow list to yeve me audience, I wol it tellen heer in your presence. But worshipful chanouns religious, Ne demeth nat that I sclaundre your hous, Al-though my tale of a chanoun be. Of every ordre som shrewe is, parde, And god forbede that al a companye Sholde rewe a singuler mannes folye. To sclaundre yow is no-thing myn entente, But to correcten that is mis I mente. This tale was nat only told for yow, But eek for othere mo; ye woot wel how That, among Cristes apostelles twelve, Ther nas no traytour but Iudas him-selve. Than why sholde al the remenant have blame That giltlees were? by yow I seye the same. Save only this, if ye wol herkne me, If any Iudas in your covent be, Remeveth him bitymes, I yow rede, If shame or los may causen any drede. And beth no-thing displesed, I yow preye, But in this cas herkneth what I shal seye. [Tertia pars.] In London was a preest, an annueleer, That therin dwelled hadde many a yeer, Which was so plesaunt and so servisable Unto the wyf, wher-as he was at table, That she wolde suffre him no-thing for to paye For bord ne clothing, wente he never so gaye; And spending-silver hadde he right y-now. Therof no fors; I wol procede as now, And telle forth my tale of the chanoun, That broghte this preest to confusioun. This false chanoun cam up-on a day Unto this preestes chambre, wher he lay, Biseching him to lene him a certeyn Of gold, and he wolde quyte it him ageyn. ‘Lene me a mark,’ quod he, ‘but dayes three, And at my day I wol it quyten thee. And if so be that thou me finde fals, Another day do hange me by the hals!’ This preest him took a mark, and that as swythe, And this chanoun him thanked ofte sythe, And took his leve, and wente forth his weye, And at the thridde day broghte his moneye, And to the preest he took his gold agayn, Wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn. ‘Certes,’ quod he, ‘no-thing anoyeth me To lene a man a noble, or two or three, Or what thing were in my possessioun, Whan he so trewe is of condicioun, That in no wyse he breke wol his day; To swich a man I can never seye nay.’ ‘What!’ quod this chanoun, ‘sholde I be untrewe? Nay, that were thing y-fallen al of-newe. Trouthe is a thing that I wol ever kepe Un-to that day in which that I shal crepe In-to my grave, and elles god forbede; Bileveth this as siker as is your crede. God thanke I, and in good tyme be it sayd, That ther was never man yet yvel apayd For gold ne silver that he to me lente, Ne never falshede in myn herte I mente. And sir,’ quod he, ‘now of my privetee, Sin ye so goodlich han been un-to me, And kythed to me so greet gentillesse, Somwhat to quyte with your kindenesse, I wol yow shewe, and, if yow list to lere, I wol yow teche pleynly the manere, How I can werken in philosophye. Taketh good heed, ye shul wel seen at yë, That I wol doon a maistrie er I go.’ ‘Ye,’ quod the preest, ‘ye, sir, and wol ye so? Marie! ther-of I pray yow hertely!’ ‘At your comandement, sir, trewely,’ Quod the chanoun, ‘and elles god forbede!’ Lo, how this theef coude his servyse bede! Ful sooth it is, that swich profred servyse Stinketh, as witnessen thise olde wyse; And that ful sone I wol it verifye In this chanoun, rote of al trecherye, That ever-more delyt hath and gladnesse— Swich feendly thoughtes in his herte impresse— How Cristes peple he may to meschief bringe; God kepe us from his fals dissimulinge! Noght wiste this preest with whom that he delte, Ne of his harm cominge he no-thing felte. O sely preest! o sely innocent! With coveityse anon thou shalt be blent! O gracelees, ful blind is thy conceit, No-thing ne artow war of the deceit Which that this fox y-shapen hath to thee! His wyly wrenches thou ne mayst nat flee. Wherfor, to go to the conclusioun That refereth to thy confusioun, Unhappy man! anon I wol me hye To tellen thyn unwit and thy folye, And eek the falsnesse of that other wrecche, As ferforth as that my conning may strecche. This chanoun was my lord, ye wolden wene? Sir host, in feith, and by the hevenes quene, It was another chanoun, and nat he, That can an hundred fold more subtiltee! He hath bitrayed folkes many tyme; Of his falshede it dulleth me to ryme. Ever whan that I speke of his falshede, For shame of him my chekes wexen rede; Algates, they biginnen for to glowe, For reednesse have I noon, right wel I knowe, In my visage; for fumes dyverse Of metals, which ye han herd me reherce, Consumed and wasted han my reednesse. Now tak heed of this chanouns cursednesse! ‘Sir,’ quod he to the preest, ‘lat your man gon For quik-silver, that we it hadde anon; And lat him bringen ounces two or three; And whan he comth, as faste shul ye see A wonder thing, which ye saugh never er this.’ ‘Sir,’ quod the preest, ‘it shal be doon, y-wis.’ He bad his servant fecchen him this thing, And he al redy was at his bidding, And wente him forth, and cam anon agayn With this quik-silver, soothly for to sayn, And took thise ounces three to the chanoun; And he hem leyde fayre and wel adoun, And bad the servant coles for to bringe, That he anon mighte go to his werkinge. The coles right anon weren y-fet, And this chanoun took out a crosselet Of his bosom, and shewed it the preest. ‘This instrument,’ quod he, ‘which that thou seest, Tak in thyn hand, and put thy-self ther-inne Of this quik-silver an ounce, and heer biginne, In the name of Crist, to wexe a philosofre. Ther been ful fewe, whiche that I wolde profre To shewen hem thus muche of my science. For ye shul seen heer, by experience, That this quik-silver wol I mortifye Right in your sighte anon, withouten lye, And make it as good silver and as fyn As ther is any in your purs or myn, Or elleswher, and make it malliable; And elles, holdeth me fals and unable Amonges folk for ever to appere! I have a poudre heer, that coste me dere, Shal make al good, for it is cause of al My conning, which that I yow shewen shal. Voydeth your man, and lat him be ther-oute, And shet the dore, whyls we been aboute Our privetee, that no man us espye Whyls that we werke in this philosophye.’ Al as he bad, fulfilled was in dede, This ilke servant anon-right out yede, And his maister shette the dore anon, And to hir labour speedily they gon. This preest, at this cursed chanouns bidding, Up-on the fyr anon sette this thing, And blew the fyr, and bisied him ful faste; And this chanoun in-to the croslet caste A poudre, noot I wher-of that it was Y-maad, other of chalk, other of glas, Or som-what elles, was nat worth a flye, To blynde with the preest; and bad him hye The coles for to couchen al above The croslet, ‘for, in tokening I thee love,’ Quod this chanoun, ‘thyn owene hondes two Shul werche al thing which that shal heer be do.’ ‘Graunt mercy,’ quod the preest, and was ful glad, And couched coles as the chanoun bad. And whyle he bisy was, this feendly wrecche, This fals chanoun, the foule feend him fecche! Out of his bosom took a bechen cole, In which ful subtilly was maad an hole, And ther-in put was of silver lymaille An ounce, and stopped was, with-outen fayle, The hole with wex, to kepe the lymail in. And understondeth, that this false gin Was nat maad ther, but it was maad bifore; And othere thinges I shal telle more Herafterward, which that he with him broghte; Er he cam ther, him to bigyle he thoghte, And so he dide, er that they wente a-twinne; Til he had terved him, coude he not blinne. It dulleth me whan that I of him speke, On his falshede fayn wolde I me wreke, If I wiste how; but he is heer and ther: He is so variaunt, he abit no-wher. But taketh heed now, sirs, for goddes love! He took his cole of which I spak above, And in his hond he baar it prively. And whyls the preest couchede busily The coles, as I tolde yow er this, This chanoun seyde, ‘freend, ye doon amis; This is nat couched as it oghte be; But sone I shal amenden it,’ quod he. ‘Now lat me medle therwith but a whyle, For of yow have I pitee, by seint Gyle! Ye been right hoot, I see wel how ye swete, Have heer a cloth, and wype awey the wete.’ And whyles that the preest wyped his face, This chanoun took his cole with harde grace, And leyde it above, up-on the middeward Of the croslet, and blew wel afterward, Til that the coles gonne faste brenne. ‘Now yeve us drinke,’ quod the chanoun thenne, ‘As swythe al shal be wel, I undertake; Sitte we doun, and lat us mery make.’ And whan that this chanounes bechen cole Was brent, al the lymaille, out of the hole, Into the croslet fil anon adoun; And so it moste nedes, by resoun, Sin it so even aboven couched was; But ther-of wiste the preest no-thing, alas! He demed alle the coles y-liche good, For of the sleighte he no-thing understood. And whan this alkamistre saugh his tyme, ‘Rys up,’ quod he, ‘sir preest, and stondeth by me; And for I woot wel ingot have ye noon, Goth, walketh forth, and bring us a chalk-stoon; For I wol make oon of the same shap That is an ingot, if I may han hap. And bringeth eek with yow a bolle or a panne, Ful of water, and ye shul see wel thanne How that our bisinesse shal thryve and preve. And yet, for ye shul han no misbileve Ne wrong conceit of me in your absence, I ne wol nat been out of your presence, But go with yow, and come with yow ageyn.’ The chambre-dore, shortly for to seyn, They opened and shette, and wente hir weye. And forth with hem they carieden the keye, And come agayn with-outen any delay. What sholde I tarien al the longe day? He took the chalk, and shoop it in the wyse Of an ingot, as I shal yow devyse. I seye, he took out of his owene sleve, A teyne of silver (yvele mote he cheve!) Which that ne was nat but an ounce of weighte; And taketh heed now of his cursed sleighte! He shoop his ingot, in lengthe and eek in brede, Of this teyne, with-outen any drede, So slyly, that the preest it nat espyde; And in his sleve agayn he gan it hyde; And fro the fyr he took up his matere, And in thingot putte it with mery chere, And in the water-vessel he it caste Whan that him luste, and bad the preest as faste, ‘Look what ther is, put in thyn hand and grope, Thow finde shalt ther silver, as I hope; What, devel of helle! sholde it elles be? Shaving of silver silver is, pardee!’ He putte his hond in, and took up a teyne Of silver fyn, and glad in every veyne Was this preest, whan he saugh that it was so. ‘Goddes blessing, and his modres also, And alle halwes have ye, sir chanoun,’ Seyde this preest, ‘and I hir malisoun, But, and ye vouche-sauf to techen me This noble craft and this subtilitee, I wol be youre, in al that ever I may!’ Quod the chanoun, ‘yet wol I make assay The second tyme, that ye may taken hede And been expert of this, and in your nede Another day assaye in myn absence This disciplyne and this crafty science. Lat take another ounce,’ quod he tho, ‘Of quik-silver, with-outen wordes mo, And do ther-with as ye han doon er this With that other, which that now silver is.’ This preest him bisieth in al that he can To doon as this chanoun, this cursed man, Comanded him, and faste he blew the fyr, For to come to theffect of his desyr. And this chanoun, right in the mene whyle, Al redy was, the preest eft to bigyle, And, for a countenance, in his hande he bar An holwe stikke (tak keep and be war!) In the ende of which an ounce, and na-more, Of silver lymail put was, as bifore Was in his cole, and stopped with wex weel For to kepe in his lymail every deel. And whyl this preest was in his bisinesse, This chanoun with his stikke gan him dresse To him anon, and his pouder caste in As he did er; (the devel out of his skin Him terve, I pray to god, for his falshede; For he was ever fals in thoght and dede); And with this stikke, above the croslet, That was ordeyned with that false get, He stired the coles, til relente gan The wex agayn the fyr, as every man, But it a fool be, woot wel it mot nede, And al that in the stikke was out yede, And in the croslet hastily it fel. Now gode sirs, what wol ye bet than wel? Whan that this preest thus was bigyled ageyn, Supposing noght but trouthe, soth to seyn, He was so glad, that I can nat expresse In no manere his mirthe and his gladnesse; And to the chanoun he profred eftsone Body and good; ‘ye,’ quod the chanoun sone, ‘Though povre I be, crafty thou shalt me finde; I warne thee, yet is ther more bihinde. Is ther any coper her-inne?’ seyde he. ‘Ye,’ quod the preest, ‘sir, I trowe wel ther be.’ ‘Elles go by us som, and that as swythe, Now, gode sir, go forth thy wey and hy the.’ He wente his wey, and with the coper cam, And this chanoun it in his handes nam, And of that coper weyed out but an ounce. Al to simple is my tonge to pronounce, As ministre of my wit, the doublenesse Of this chanoun, rote of al cursednesse. He semed freendly to hem that knewe him noght, But he was feendly bothe in herte and thoght. It werieth me to telle of his falsnesse, And nathelees yet wol I it expresse, To thentente that men may be war therby, And for noon other cause, trewely. He putte his ounce of coper in the croslet, And on the fyr as swythe he hath it set, And caste in poudre, and made the preest to blowe, And in his werking for to stoupe lowe, As he dide er, and al nas but a Iape; Right as him liste, the preest he made his ape; And afterward in the ingot he it caste, And in the panne putte it at the laste Of water, and in he putte his owene hond. And in his sleve (as ye biforn-hond Herde me telle) he hadde a silver teyne. He slyly took it out, this cursed heyne— Unwiting this preest of his false craft— And in the pannes botme he hath it laft; And in the water rombled to and fro, And wonder prively took up also The coper teyne, noght knowing this preest, And hidde it, and him hente by the breest, And to him spak, and thus seyde in his game, ‘Stoupeth adoun, by god, ye be to blame, Helpeth me now, as I dide yow whyl-er, Putte in your hand, and loketh what is ther.’ This preest took up this silver teyne anon, And thanne seyde the chanoun, ‘lat us gon With thise three teynes, which that we han wroght, To som goldsmith, and wite if they been oght. For, by my feith, I nolde, for myn hood, But-if that they were silver, fyn and good, And that as swythe preved shal it be.’ Un-to the goldsmith with thise teynes three They wente, and putte thise teynes in assay To fyr and hamer; mighte no man sey nay, But that they weren as hem oghte be. This sotted preest, who was gladder than he? Was never brid gladder agayn the day, Ne nightingale, in the sesoun of May, Nas never noon that luste bet to singe; Ne lady lustier in carolinge Or for to speke of love and wommanhede, Ne knight in armes to doon an hardy dede To stonde in grace of his lady dere, Than had this preest this sory craft to lere; And to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde, ‘For love of god, that for us alle deyde, And as I may deserve it un-to yow, What shal this receit coste? telleth now!’ ‘By our lady,’ quod this chanoun, ‘it is dere, I warne yow wel; for, save I and a frere, In Engelond ther can no man it make.’ ‘No fors,’ quod he, ‘now, sir, for goddes sake, What shal I paye? telleth me, I preye.’ ‘Y-wis,’ quod he, ‘it is ful dere, I seye; Sir, at o word, if that thee list it have, Ye shul paye fourty pound, so god me save! And, nere the freendship that ye dide er this To me, ye sholde paye more, y-wis.’ This preest the somme of fourty pound anon Of nobles fette, and took hem everichon To this chanoun, for this ilke receit; Al his werking nas but fraude and deceit. ‘Sir preest,’ he seyde, ‘I kepe han no loos Of my craft, for I wolde it kept were cloos; And as ye love me, kepeth it secree; For, and men knewe al my subtilitee, By god, they wolden han so greet envye To me, by-cause of my philosophye, I sholde be deed, ther were non other weye.’ ‘God it forbede!’ quod the preest, ‘what sey ye?’ Yet hadde I lever spenden al the good Which that I have (and elles wexe I wood!) Than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef.’ ‘For your good wil, sir, have ye right good preef,’ Quod the chanoun, ‘and far-wel, grant mercy!’ He wente his wey and never the preest him sy After that day; and whan that this preest sholde Maken assay, at swich tyme as he wolde, Of this receit, far-wel! it wolde nat be! Lo, thus byiaped and bigyled was he! Thus maketh he his introduccioun To bringe folk to hir destruccioun.— [Quarta pars.] Considereth, sirs, how that, in ech estaat, Bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat So ferforth, that unnethes is ther noon. This multiplying blent so many oon, That in good feith I trowe that it be The cause grettest of swich scarsetee. Philosophres speken so mistily In this craft, that men can nat come therby, For any wit that men han now a-dayes. They mowe wel chiteren, as doon thise Iayes, And in her termes sette hir lust and peyne, But to hir purpos shul they never atteyne. A man may lightly lerne, if he have aught, To multiplye, and bringe his good to naught! Lo! swich a lucre is in this lusty game, A mannes mirthe it wol torne un-to grame, And empten also grete and hevy purses, And maken folk for to purchasen curses Of hem, that han hir good therto y-lent. O! fy! for shame! they that han been brent, Allas! can they nat flee the fyres hete? Ye that it use, I rede ye it lete, Lest ye lese al; for bet than never is late. Never to thryve were to long a date. Though ye prolle ay, ye shul it never finde; Ye been as bolde as is Bayard the blinde, That blundreth forth, and peril casteth noon; He is as bold to renne agayn a stoon As for to goon besydes in the weye. So faren ye that multiplye, I seye. If that your yën can nat seen aright, Loke that your minde lakke nought his sight. For, though ye loke never so brode, and stare, Ye shul nat winne a myte on that chaffare, But wasten al that ye may rape and renne. Withdrawe the fyr, lest it to faste brenne; Medleth na-more with that art, I mene, For, if ye doon, your thrift is goon ful clene. And right as swythe I wol yow tellen here, What philosophres seyn in this matere. Lo, thus seith Arnold of the Newe Toun, As his Rosarie maketh mencioun; He seith right thus, with-outen any lye, ‘Ther may no man Mercurie mortifye, But it be with his brother knowleching. How that he, which that first seyde this thing, Of philosophres fader was, Hermes; He seith, how that the dragoun, doutelees, Ne deyeth nat, but-if that he be slayn With his brother; and that is for to sayn, By the dragoun, Mercurie and noon other He understood; and brimstoon by his brother, That out of sol and luna were y-drawe. And therfor,’ seyde he, ‘tak heed to my sawe, Let no man bisy him this art for to seche, But-if that he thentencioun and speche Of philosophres understonde can; And if he do, he is a lewed man. For this science and this conning,’ quod he, ‘Is of the secree of secrees, parde.’ Also ther was a disciple of Plato, That on a tyme seyde his maister to, As his book Senior wol bere witnesse, And this was his demande in soothfastnesse: ‘Tel me the name of the privy stoon?’ And Plato answerde unto him anoon, ‘Tak the stoon that Titanos men name.’ ‘Which is that?’ quod he. ‘Magnesia is the same,’ Seyde Plato. ‘Ye, sir, and is it thus? This is ignotum per ignotius. What is Magnesia, good sir, I yow preye?’ ‘It is a water that is maad, I seye, Of elementes foure,’ quod Plato. ‘Tel me the rote, good sir,’ quod he tho, ‘Of that water, if that it be your wille?’ ‘Nay, nay,’ quod Plato, ‘certein, that I nille. The philosophres sworn were everichoon, That they sholden discovere it un-to noon, Ne in no book it wryte in no manere; For un-to Crist it is so leef and dere That he wol nat that it discovered be, But wher it lyketh to his deitee Man for tenspyre, and eek for to defende Whom that him lyketh; lo, this is the ende.’ Thanne conclude I thus; sith god of hevene Ne wol nat that the philosophres nevene How that a man shal come un-to this stoon, I rede, as for the beste, lete it goon. For who-so maketh god his adversarie, As for to werken any thing in contrarie Of his wil, certes, never shal he thryve, Thogh that he multiplye terme of his lyve. And ther a poynt; for ended is my tale; God sende every trewe man bote of his bale! —Amen. Here is ended the Chanouns Yemannes Tale. GROUP H. THE MANCIPLE'S PROLOGUE. Here folweth the Prologe of the Maunciples Tale. Wite ye nat wher ther stant a litel toun Which that y-cleped is Bob-up-and-doun, Under the Blee, in Caunterbury weye? Ther gan our hoste for to Iape and pleye, And seyde, ‘sirs, what! Dun is in the myre! Is ther no man, for preyere ne for hyre, That wol awake our felawe heer bihinde? A theef mighte him ful lightly robbe and binde. See how he nappeth! see, for cokkes bones, As he wol falle from his hors at ones. Is that a cook of Londoun, with meschaunce? Do him come forth, he knoweth his penaunce, For he shal telle a tale, by my fey! Al-though it be nat worth a botel hey. Awake, thou cook,’ quod he, ‘god yeve thee sorwe, What eyleth thee to slepe by the morwe? Hastow had fleen al night, or artow dronke, Or hastow with som quene al night y-swonke, So that thou mayst nat holden up thyn heed?’ This cook, that was ful pale and no-thing reed, Seyde to our host, ‘so god my soule blesse, As ther is falle on me swich hevinesse, Noot I nat why, that me were lever slepe Than the beste galoun wyn in Chepe.’ ‘Wel,’ quod the maunciple, ‘if it may doon ese To thee, sir cook, and to no wight displese Which that heer rydeth in this companye, And that our host wol, of his curteisye, I wol as now excuse thee of thy tale; For, in good feith, thy visage is ful pale, Thyn yën daswen eek, as that me thinketh, And wel I woot, thy breeth ful soure stinketh, That sheweth wel thou art not wel disposed; Of me, certein, thou shalt nat been y-glosed. Se how he ganeth, lo, this dronken wight, As though he wolde us swolwe anon-right. Hold cloos thy mouth, man, by thy fader kin! The devel of helle sette his foot ther-in! Thy cursed breeth infecte wol us alle; Fy, stinking swyn, fy! foule moot thee falle! A! taketh heed, sirs, of this lusty man. Now, swete sir, wol ye Iusten atte fan? Ther-to me thinketh ye been wel y-shape! I trowe that ye dronken han wyn ape, And that is whan men pleyen with a straw.’ And with this speche the cook wex wrooth and wraw, And on the maunciple he gan nodde faste For lakke of speche, and doun the hors him caste, Wher as he lay, til that men up him took; This was a fayr chivachee of a cook! Allas! he nadde holde him by his ladel! And, er that he agayn were in his sadel, Ther was greet showving bothe to and fro, To lifte him up, and muchel care and wo, So unweldy was this sory palled gost. And to the maunciple thanne spak our host, ‘By-cause drink hath dominacioun Upon this man, by my savacioun I trowe he lewedly wolde telle his tale. For, were it wyn, or old or moysty ale, That he hath dronke, he speketh in his nose, And fneseth faste, and eek he hath the pose. He hath also to do more than y-nough To kepe him and his capel out of slough; And, if he falle from his capel eft-sone, Than shul we alle have y-nough to done, In lifting up his hevy dronken cors. Telle on thy tale, of him make I no fors. But yet, maunciple, in feith thou art to nyce, Thus openly repreve him of his vyce. Another day he wol, peraventure, Reclayme thee, and bringe thee to lure; I mene, he speke wol of smale thinges, As for to pinchen at thy rekeninges, That wer not honeste, if it cam to preef.’ ‘No,’ quod the maunciple, ‘that were a greet mescheef! So mighte he lightly bringe me in the snare. Yet hadde I lever payen for the mare Which he rit on, than he sholde with me stryve; I wol nat wratthe him, al-so mote I thryve! That that I spak, I seyde it in my bourde; And wite ye what? I have heer, in a gourde, A draught of wyn, ye, of a rype grape, And right anon ye shul seen a good Iape. This cook shal drinke ther-of, if I may; Up peyne of deeth, he wol nat seye me nay!’ And certeinly, to tellen as it was, Of this vessel the cook drank faste, allas! What neded him? he drank y-nough biforn. And whan he hadde pouped in this horn, To the maunciple he took the gourde agayn; And of that drinke the cook was wonder fayn, And thanked him in swich wyse as he coude. Than gan our host to laughen wonder loude, And seyde, ‘I see wel, it is necessarie, Wher that we goon, good drink we with us carie; For that wol turne rancour and disese Tacord and love, and many a wrong apese. O thou Bachus, y-blessed be thy name, That so canst turnen ernest in-to game! Worship and thank be to thy deitee! Of that matere ye gete na-more of me. Tel on thy tale, maunciple, I thee preye.’ ‘Wel, sir,’ quod he, ‘now herkneth what I seye.’ Thus endeth the Prologe of the Manciple. THE MAUNCIPLES TALE. Here biginneth the Maunciples Tale of the Crowe. Whan Phebus dwelled here in this erthe adoun, As olde bokes maken mencioun, He was the moste lusty bachiler In al this world, and eek the beste archer; He slow Phitoun, the serpent, as he lay Slepinge agayn the sonne upon a day; And many another noble worthy dede He with his bowe wroghte, as men may rede. Pleyen he coude on every minstralcye, And singen, that it was a melodye, To heren of his clere vois the soun. Certes the king of Thebes, Amphioun, That with his singing walled that citee, Coude never singen half so wel as he. Therto he was the semelieste man That is or was, sith that the world bigan. What nedeth it his fetures to discryve? For in this world was noon so fair on lyve. He was ther-with fulfild of gentillesse, Of honour, and of parfit worthinesse. This Phebus, that was flour of bachelrye, As wel in fredom as in chivalrye, For his desport, in signe eek of victorie Of Phitoun, so as telleth us the storie, Was wont to beren in his hand a bowe. Now had this Phebus in his hous a crowe, Which in a cage he fostred many a day, And taughte it speken, as men teche a Iay. Whyt was this crowe, as is a snow-whyt swan, And countrefete the speche of every man He coude, whan he sholde telle a tale. Ther-with in al this world no nightingale Ne coude, by an hondred thousand deel, Singen so wonder merily and weel. Now had this Phebus in his hous a wyf, Which that he lovede more than his lyf, And night and day dide ever his diligence Hir for to plese, and doon hir reverence, Save only, if the sothe that I shal sayn, Ialous he was, and wolde have kept hir fayn; For him were looth by-iaped for to be. And so is every wight in swich degree; But al in ydel, for it availleth noght. A good wyf, that is clene of werk and thoght, Sholde nat been kept in noon await, certayn; And trewely, the labour is in vayn To kepe a shrewe, for it wol nat be. This holde I for a verray nycetee, To spille labour, for to kepe wyves; Thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves. But now to purpos, as I first bigan: This worthy Phebus dooth all that he can To plesen hir, weninge by swich plesaunce, And for his manhede and his governaunce, That no man sholde han put him from hir grace. But god it woot, ther may no man embrace As to destreyne a thing, which that nature Hath naturelly set in a creature. Tak any brid, and put it in a cage, And do al thyn entente and thy corage To fostre it tendrely with mete and drinke, Of alle deyntees that thou canst bithinke, And keep it al-so clenly as thou may; Al-though his cage of gold be never so gay, Yet hath this brid, by twenty thousand fold, Lever in a forest, that is rude and cold, Gon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse. For ever this brid wol doon his bisinesse To escape out of his cage, if he may; His libertee this brid desireth ay. Lat take a cat, and fostre him wel with milk, And tendre flesh, and make his couche of silk, And lat him seen a mous go by the wal; Anon he weyveth milk, and flesh, and al, And every deyntee that is in that hous, Swich appetyt hath he to ete a mous. Lo, here hath lust his dominacioun, And appetyt flemeth discrecioun. A she-wolf hath also a vileins kinde; The lewedeste wolf that she may finde, Or leest of reputacion wol she take, In tyme whan hir lust to han a make. Alle thise ensamples speke I by thise men That been untrewe, and no-thing by wommen. For men han ever a likerous appetyt On lower thing to parfourne hir delyt Than on hir wyves, be they never so faire, Ne never so trewe, ne so debonaire. Flesh is so newefangel, with meschaunce, That we ne conne in no-thing han pleasaunce That souneth in-to vertu any whyle. This Phebus, which that thoghte upon no gyle, Deceyved was, for al his Iolitee; For under him another hadde she, A man of litel reputacioun, Noght worth to Phebus in comparisoun. The more harm is; it happeth ofte so, Of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo. And so bifel, whan Phebus was absent, His wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent, Hir lemman? certes, this is a knavish speche! Foryeveth it me, and that I yow biseche. The wyse Plato seith, as ye may rede, The word mot nede accorde with the dede. If men shal telle proprely a thing, The word mot cosin be to the werking. I am a boistous man, right thus seye I, Ther nis no difference, trewely, Bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree, If of hir body dishonest she be, And a povre wenche, other than this— If it so be, they werke bothe amis— But that the gentile, in estaat above, She shal be cleped his lady, as in love; And for that other is a povre womman, She shal be cleped his wenche, or his lemman. And, god it woot, myn owene dere brother, Men leyn that oon as lowe as lyth that other. Right so, bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt And an outlawe, or a theef erraunt, The same I seye, ther is no difference. To Alisaundre told was this sentence; That, for the tyrant is of gretter might, By force of meynee for to sleen doun-right, And brennen hous and hoom, and make al plain, Lo! therfor is he cleped a capitain; And, for the outlawe hath but smal meynee, And may nat doon so greet an harm as he, Ne bringe a contree to so greet mescheef, Men clepen him an outlawe or a theef. But, for I am a man noght textuel, I wol noght telle of textes never a del; I wol go to my tale, as I bigan. Whan Phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman, Anon they wroghten al hir lust volage. The whyte crowe, that heng ay in the cage, Biheld hir werk, and seyde never a word. And whan that hoom was come Phebus, the lord, This crowe sang ‘cokkow! cokkow! cokkow!’ ‘What, brid?’ quod Phebus, ‘what song singestow? Ne were thow wont so merily to singe That to myn herte it was a reioisinge To here thy vois? allas! what song is this?’ ‘By god,’ quod he, ‘I singe nat amis; Phebus,’ quod he, ‘for al thy worthinesse, For al thy beautee and thy gentilesse, For al thy song and al thy minstralcye, For al thy waiting, blered is thyn yë With oon of litel reputacioun, Noght worth to thee, as in comparisoun, The mountance of a gnat; so mote I thryve! For on thy bed thy wyf I saugh him swyve.’ What wol ye more? the crowe anon him tolde, By sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde, How that his wyf had doon hir lecherye, Him to gret shame and to gret vileinye; And tolde him ofte, he saugh it with his yën. This Phebus gan aweyward for to wryen, Him thoughte his sorweful herte brast a-two; His bowe he bente, and sette ther-inne a flo, And in his ire his wyf thanne hath he slayn. This is theffect, ther is na-more to sayn; For sorwe of which he brak his minstralcye, Bothe harpe, and lute, and giterne, and sautrye; And eek he brak his arwes and his bowe. And after that, thus spak he to the crowe: ‘Traitour,’ quod he, ‘with tonge of scorpioun, Thou hast me broght to my confusioun! Allas! that I was wroght! why nere I deed? O dere wyf, o gemme of lustiheed, That were to me so sad and eek so trewe, Now lystow deed, with face pale of hewe, Ful giltelees, that dorste I swere, y-wis! O rakel hand, to doon so foule amis! O trouble wit, o ire recchelees, That unavysed smytest giltelees! O wantrust, ful of fals suspecioun, Where was thy wit and thy discrecioun? O every man, be-war of rakelnesse, Ne trowe no-thing with-outen strong witnesse; Smyt nat to sone, er that ye witen why, And beeth avysed wel and sobrely Er ye doon any execucioun, Up-on your ire, for suspecioun. Allas! a thousand folk hath rakel ire Fully fordoon, and broght hem in the mire. Allas! for sorwe I wol my-selven slee!’ And to the crowe, ‘o false theef!’ seyde he, ‘I wol thee quyte anon thy false tale! Thou songe whylom lyk a nightingale; Now shaltow, false theef, thy song forgon, And eek thy whyte fetheres everichon, Ne never in al thy lyf ne shaltou speke. Thus shal men on a traitour been awreke; Thou and thyn of-spring ever shul be blake, Ne never swete noise shul ye make, But ever crye agayn tempest and rayn, In tokeninge that thurgh thee my wyf is slayn.’ And to the crowe he stirte, and that anon, And pulled his whyte fetheres everichon, And made him blak, and refte him al his song, And eek his speche, and out at dore him slong Un-to the devel, which I him bitake; And for this caas ben alle crowes blake.— Lordings, by this ensample I yow preye, Beth war, and taketh kepe what I seye: Ne telleth never no man in your lyf How that another man hath dight his wyf; He wol yow haten mortally, certeyn. Daun Salomon, as wyse clerkes seyn, Techeth a man to kepe his tonge wel; But as I seyde, I am noght textuel. But nathelees, thus taughte me my dame: ‘My sone, thenk on the crowe, a goddes name; My sone, keep wel thy tonge and keep thy freend. A wikked tonge is worse than a feend. My sone, from a feend men may hem blesse; My sone, god of his endelees goodnesse Walled a tonge with teeth and lippes eke, For man sholde him avyse what he speke. My sone, ful ofte, for to muche speche, Hath many a man ben spilt, as clerkes teche; But for a litel speche avysely Is no men shent, to speke generally. My sone, thy tonge sholdestow restreyne At alle tyme, but whan thou doost thy peyne To speke of god, in honour and preyere. The firste vertu, sone, if thou wolt lere, Is to restreyne and kepe wel thy tonge.— Thus lerne children whan that they ben yonge.— My sone, of muchel speking yvel-avysed, Ther lasse speking hadde y-nough suffysed, Comth muchel harm, thus was me told and taught. In muchel speche sinne wanteth naught. Wostow wher-of a rakel tonge serveth? Right as a swerd forcutteth and forkerveth An arm a-two, my dere sone, right so A tonge cutteth frendship al a-two. A Iangler is to god abhominable; Reed Salomon, so wys and honurable; Reed David in his psalmes, reed Senekke. My sone, spek nat, but with thyn heed thou bekke. Dissimule as thou were deef, if that thou here A Iangler speke of perilous matere. The Fleming seith, and lerne it, if thee leste, That litel Iangling causeth muchel reste. My sone, if thou no wikked word hast seyd, Thee thar nat drede for to be biwreyd; But he that hath misseyd, I dar wel sayn, He may by no wey clepe his word agayn. Thing that is seyd, is seyd; and forth it gooth, Though him repente, or be him leef or looth. He is his thral to whom that he hath sayd A tale, of which he is now yvel apayd. My sone, be war, and be non auctour newe Of tydinges, whether they ben false or trewe. Wher-so thou come, amonges hye or lowe, Kepe wel thy tonge, and thenk up-on the crowe. Here is ended the Maunciples Tale of the Crowe. GROUP I. THE PARSON'S PROLOGUE. Here folweth the Prologe of the Persones Tale. By that the maunciple hadde his tale al ended, The sonne fro the south lyne was descended So lowe, that he nas nat, to my sighte, Degreës nyne and twenty as in highte. Foure of the clokke it was tho, as I gesse; For eleven foot, or litel more or lesse, My shadwe was at thilke tyme, as there, Of swich feet as my lengthe parted were In six feet equal of proporcioun. Ther-with the mones exaltacioun, I mene Libra, alwey gan ascende, As we were entringe at a thropes ende; For which our host, as he was wont to gye, As in this caas, our Ioly companye, Seyde in this wyse, ‘lordings everichoon, Now lakketh us no tales mo than oon. Fulfild is my sentence and my decree; I trowe that we han herd of ech degree. Almost fulfild is al myn ordinaunce; I prey to god, so yeve him right good chaunce, That telleth this tale to us lustily. Sir preest,’ quod he, ‘artow a vicary? Or art a person? sey sooth, by thy fey! Be what thou be, ne breke thou nat our pley; For every man, save thou, hath told his tale, Unbokel, and shewe us what is in thy male; For trewely, me thinketh, by thy chere, Thou sholdest knitte up wel a greet matere. Tel us a tale anon, for cokkes bones!’ This Persone him answerde, al at ones, ‘Thou getest fable noon y-told for me; For Paul, that wryteth unto Timothee, Repreveth hem that weyven soothfastnesse, And tellen fables and swich wrecchednesse. Why sholde I sowen draf out of my fest, Whan I may sowen whete, if that me lest? For which I seye, if that yow list to here Moralitee and vertuous matere, And thanne that ye wol yeve me audience, I wol ful fayn, at Cristes reverence, Do yow plesaunce leefful, as I can. But trusteth wel, I am a Southren man, I can nat geste—rum, ram, ruf—by lettre, Ne, god wot, rym holde I but litel bettre; And therfor, if yow list, I wol nat glose. I wol yow telle a mery tale in prose To knitte up al this feeste, and make an ende. And Iesu, for his grace, wit me sende To shewe yow the wey, in this viage, Of thilke parfit glorious pilgrimage That highte Ierusalem celestial. And, if ye vouche-sauf, anon I shal Biginne upon my tale, for whiche I preye Telle your avys, I can no bettre seye. But nathelees, this meditacioun I putte it ay under correccioun Of clerkes, for I am nat textuel; I take but the sentens, trusteth wel. Therfor I make protestacioun That I wol stonde to correccioun.’ Up-on this word we han assented sone, For, as us semed, it was for to done, To enden in som vertuous sentence, And for to yeve him space and audience; And bede our host he sholde to him seye, That alle we to telle his tale him preye. Our host hadde the wordes for us alle:— ‘Sir preest,’ quod he, ‘now fayre yow bifalle! Sey what yow list, and we wol gladly here’— And with that word he seyde in this manere— ‘Telleth,’ quod he, ‘your meditacioun. But hasteth yow, the sonne wol adoun; Beth fructuous, and that in litel space, And to do wel god sende yow his grace!’ Explicit prohemium. END OF VOL. IV.</field>
