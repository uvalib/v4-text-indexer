      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. THE ABBEY. Known full well in many a monkish fable, Is that abbey of the olden time: Ivied arches now and ruined gable, Deep encompassed by the flowering lime. Fallen oriels, once of ruby lustre, Fallen columns wrought by skilful hand, Intertwined with rowan berries' cluster Coral-like on Southern ocean's strand. Peace and rest—perchance the best enjoyment Of this life a brotherhood could find In these hallowed walls; their blessed employment, Prayer—the solace of each wearied mind. How they paced in quiet meditation, Would these cloister-gardens now might tell! In some legendary tale's relation Pausing, summoned by the vesper bell. Time, whose iron footsteps never falter, Crumbles 'neath his tread that sacred pile, Where in mitred state by their high altar Sleep the abbots in the mouldering aisle. Fretted arch and shaft around them lying, As if careless to survive their fall; Like true soldiers with their generals dying, In the circle of their castle wall: Rest they in a pleasant spot! before them Rising casts yon hill its grateful shade; As a mother gently bending o'er them, Folds her children in a mountain plaid: Rest! nor will this tale of desolation, Scarcely falling on their slumbrous ear, Raise those folded hands in lamentation, Wet those closèd eyelids with a tear. Lull them wafted music from that mountain! Wandering melody of heather bee! Softened murmurs from the river counting Every rock that keeps her from the sea. Lull them whispered sound of mighty labour! Borne on myriad voices o'er the plain; From yon distant wreaths of smoke and vapour, Rising from the fiery haunts of gain: Whispering all, that nothing here remaineth! Like their abbey all must pass away: Happiest he, who blest, as these, obtaineth Peaceful slumbers after life's sad day. THE ROADSIDE WELL. A maid filled her pitcher once out of a well, By a road that ran lonely 'twixt mountain and fell. A youth passing saw her, and slackened his speed, Then water craved he for himself and his steed. She gave him to drink with so gracious a smile, That he gazed, o'er the cup, in her face all the while. “Yon spring's ripples sport over marble rocks, So stray o'er thy forehead the waving locks. The spring babbles gently o'er marble clear, So falls in soft cadence thy voice on mine ear— Its bubbles like diamonds sparkle and dance, All vainly to rival thine eyes' flashing glance.” In the well as all blushes her pitcher she dips, One little kiss stole he in haste from her lips; Then turned he, and rode to the mountain away, But her beauty still haunted him many a day. The maiden, she thinks of the stranger's bright eyes, And oft by that fountain she sits her and cries. I wean that her tears full quickly would dry, If the youth on his steed came again riding by. MOMENTS. Ours is a lifelong strife with pain and sorrow, From helpless infancy to wrinkled age: Ours unremitting toil, that no to-morrow Shall ease, nor any future time assuage. Yet there are moments when, in phantom distance, Happiness hovering on her radiant wings, Allows us glimpses of a blest existence, To cheer us fainting on to better things. Though scanty raindrops upon life's great ocean, Stars far asunder on life's clouded sky, Like angel comforters in deep emotion, Such moments make us live that fain would die. No lapse of ages shall their brightness tarnish, Nor years revolving dim their golden hues. These pain and anguish from us cannot banish, These sorrow's gloom with fairer light endues. Time can in mercy smooth affliction's traces, And deck the front of care with flowerets gay; But those bright memories ne'er his hand effaces,— Born from above they reck not of decay. Yet oft we prized them not when they were passing, Till, looking back through mists of years, we know That while along life's rugged path advancing, We passed unconscious through an Iris bow. Strange mixtures we of highest aspiration, Tainted by passions, earthborn as our clay— One moment fallen below the brute creation, Another soaring as the Lord of day. The Moorish Chalif when his life was waning, The foeman's reverence and his people's joy; In his long years deemed prosperous, found remaining Few days of happiness without alloy. I too have known, in my life's fitful story, Some hours more blest than word or thought can tell, Whose bright remembrance lies enshrined in glory, Though I then saw her last I loved so well. We sat together as the twilight falling, Clad with mysterious shades each dusky hill; We heard at times the plaintive wood-dove calling, From those dark pines where sunset lingered still. Few words we said; but soul with soul communion, Held in unspoken bliss, akin to pain: We knew the morrow must dissolve our union,— In after years we should not meet again: Or if we met, should meet in tears, and wonder Of souls congenial why fate's cruel bar Should keep the destinies as wide asunder, As from earth's centre to the Northern star? Night from their labours manifold reposing, Cradled earth's children soon in wished-for rest; And in her all-receiving bosom dozing, Tired nature stayed her toil, and then was blest. And thus we sat until the hour of sadness, When all too early dawned that hateful day. How dreary seemed all nature in her gladness, As trembling then I tore myself away. HERO AND LEANDER. Kisses each little rock the wanton breaker, Foam-crested on the Hellespontine shore; But his encircling arms will soon forsake her, Back frighted to the sea by tempest roar. Tempt not to-night the angry waves, Leander! Tempt not the cruel current wide and strong! Hero for once may bear alone to wander, The vine-clad heights, the olive-groves along; Through saffron-yielding meadows gently straying, Alone may cull the tender crocus flower, And grieve her lover's fingers are not playing With her dark ringlets in some cypress bower. The day is waning: purple clouds of vapour In sunset stormy promise stormy morn; Through wind and mist he sees her well-known taper, His heaving breast with love's impatience torn. And he will go: his arm with strength untiring Will buffet for her sake each wave aside: Eròs will guard his love-bound course, desiring His angry wind-rout Æolus to chide. And Hero sits, the cloud-coursed moon above her, Watching the sea break on the shore to-night. Forebodings whisper danger to her lover, Her strange emotions tell his dangerous plight. The waves have left him now. O bitter anguish! As low she bends o'er his death-pallid brow— Her soul uncomforted will droop and languish, There's nothing left on earth for Hero now! Nought but to tend his grave! and each returning Springtide and autumn,—nature's birth and death,— To wear away her heart with bitter yearning, To pray the Gods to stay life's hateful breath. VITANDA EST IMPROBA SIREN. All in a cavern near the sea, hung o'er With many a crystal gem, and stalactite; Hard by the waves, against a rock-girt shore, Uprose in fearful height; But entered not, nor stirred its quiet pool, Where seaweed intertwined with corals grew, And scattered shells flashed through the waters cool, In depths of clearest blue— A nymph, than whom from Ocean's rosy foam The new-born Aphroditè rising fair, Was scarce more beautiful, began to comb Slowly her golden hair— Unlike reality that form divine, Fair as some vision of remembered dreams, Fair as to suppliants in dim-lighted shrine Some sculptured goddess gleams— Sometimes uprising on her seaweed throne, She took her harp, and sang a mystic lay. Of that weird music the unearthly tone The rippling waves obey. Woe to the sailor who that music hears, Or on her radiant beauty dares to gaze— O pleasure bought by man for countless tears, And many tearful days! She rocks him gently, as a wearied child, Lulled on her breast, to songs of sweetest breath, And cradled in her arms in slumber mild— In slumber which is death! Thus siren pleasure, fair to outward sight, Still sitteth throned on hidden bones of men: But of that number whom her charms delight How few return again! Still offereth every gift that mortals prize, And hers the power to bid each sense rejoice— But death is lurking in her lustrous eyes, Death in her winsome voice! CHRISTMAS DAY. This is the time when Christ was born, And all the earth rejoiced— And in the eastern purple dawn The choirs of heaven, full-voiced, Sang like those children of the morn, Ere flowers with dew were moist! Countless spirits! myriad angel-legions! From the realms of everlasting day, Low descending from those heavenly regions, Did awake the hymn of praise to-day, To their king descending paid allegiance, King and God, though veiled in mortal clay. His reign eternal gloriously, Rolls on in peaceful years; And his blessed power from every eye, Doth wipe away the tears. What foeman can his power defy, Whom all creation fears? Joy and praise, and ecstacy and wonder, Thrilling of men's hearts each inmost cell, Burst the Seraph's burning lips asunder,— Joy too great for human words to tell; Hymned in songs of praise on peals of thunder, Like a hundred organs' mighty swell. How shall we this great warrior flee, If we reject his word? All space against his just decree No refuge can afford! His shield is as the azure sea, And bathed in heaven his sword! From that journey long of toil and danger, By a way no mortal aid has told, Bending on his knees each kingly stranger, Did to greater King his gifts unfold: Star-led Magi in that humble manger, Offered myrrh and frankincense and gold. See! on that dark Judæan hill, Keep shepherds watch by night; Hark! sounding through the darkness still, Anthems of angels bright Make melody to charm and fill Men's souls with strange delight! Loud with choirs of Seraphim exclaiming, Let us join our feeble voices then; Though the mysteries that we are naming Far transcend our frail and earthly ken: Join we still their message in proclaiming, Peace on earth, and wondrous love towards men. PYGMALION. “I have spent in toil without cessation, Hours of disappointment! hours of pain! To embody this my soul's creation; Rest a stranger to my throbbing brain. “Toiling till I saw a perfect creature 'Neath my chisel never wearied grow; Started from the rock each clear-cut feature, Limbs in whiteness as the drifted snow. “Glided by the hours in silent number, Scarcely marked by me who took delight In her new-born beauty, leaving slumber Late deferred through watches of the night. “Then I laid me down until Aurora Came all blushing from the Eastern plain, Brushed with tiny feet the dew before her,— Then I rose and sought my work again. “Till she stood before me, lifelike, real, All perfection in one form combined— Blessed expression of my soul's ideal, Outward figured image of the mind. “Locks ambrosial, as the curls of Hebe, Clustering thick adown her ivory side; Fair proportioned as the virgin Phœbe, Floats star-crowned above in queenly pride. “Eyes of deepest passion, softly lighted, By the mirth of Cytherea's smile, When she first, all foam-bedewed, alighted, Zephyr-wafted, on her own dear Isle. “Eròs golden shafts were never able Yet to reach from mortal beauty's eyes One ideal beauty could enable Fairest nymphs of Cyprus to despise. “Vain the boast! for I too late discover I have cherished for a senseless stone Unrepressed the feelings of a lover, Vainly deemed the love of art alone; “Till I loved intensely, beyond measure,— Ne'er by Love was mortal so beguiled!— More than miser loves his hoarded treasure, More than mother loves her firstborn child. “For I formed thee all without assistance, As the rock my labouring hand obeyed; That we love which owes us its existence, Loving most what we alone have made. “Yet this toil has been mine own undoing! Would I had not made thee half so fair!— Madly I, the lifeless marble wooing, Irritate the Gods with useless prayer! “Old Prometheus, in the mythic history, With a spark once fired earth's sluggish clay. Had I but that Titan's secret mystery, Thee to life I'd surely wake to-day.” Thus he ceased—his eyes with tears down-streaming: But Zeus heard from heaven his lofty place; And the sculptor thought that he was dreaming, As the image warmed in his embrace. As beneath the marble's pallid whiteness, Came a rosy tint of healthful hue; Coral lips, and eyes of starry brightness, Flashed upon his much amazèd view. Thought it still was fancy's vain creation, As life's heat pervading every part, Blue veins in the stone with small pulsation Timed to beatings of her wakening heart. Her half-parted lips not yet believing, Kissed he, hanging on her new-found breath; Still in doubt, he felt her bosom heaving, Shaking off its icy trance of death. Then how wondrous was the bliss that filled him, When he knew the Gods had heard his prayer: That great happiness that would have killed him, Zeus in pity gave him strength to bear. MYCERINUS' DAUGHTER. Kiss me, my father! for I feel that death, Is hanging o'er my brow, and dims my sight: The all-embracer, with his icy breath, Fast darkening to one long eternal night. Yet not eternal: for the butterfly, The wintry trammels from itself can shake Of motionless existence, soaring high, When newly from its chrysalis awake. A humble worm before—a creeping thing,— It flutters forth to court the noonday sun; And finds upon its azure-tinted wing A brighter sphere of fairer life begun. Fit emblem this the soul to represent,— A boy with finger on his lips close bound; One arm declining on a torch is leant, A butterfly its flame is hovering round. This too my hope, the soul can never die, I find foreshadowed in the yearly grain We cast into the earth, to multiply Itself a hundred-fold when risen again. The latent life is quickened by the power Of yon great river of our Fatherland, By which we all subsist, and hour by hour Crave our support from out its plenteous hand. The plumed ibis watching on the bank— The crocodile upon his sandy lair— The king—the slave—all ages—every rank— Of its great bounty seek their daily share. Raise me once more from this my bed of pain, To watch it gliding on, so broad and still! Onwards towards where its seven mouths kiss the main, From sources hidden far o'er yon distant hill! Nile-God, whose brows with lotus flowers are crowned! Thy sacred stream invoking, hear my cry! Isis has veiled her mystic face, and frowned,— Hard fate, while youth is fresh and bright, to die! Existence still is sweet—wrong's searing touch, Adversity's pale face, I scarce have known— But fortune men unworthy honouring much, Oft makes the guiltless others' crimes atone. Yet who can tell but that the Gods may give, Some consciousness e'en when our breath has fled: Some sense of outward nature still may live, Its beauty bring some pleasure to the dead. Then bear, O father! well my prayer in mind; Nor bury me afar from light of day, Within some pyramid's dark gloom confined, 'Mid labyrinths of corses and decay. Nay! rather place me where the sun's best light May once a year at least bedew my face; When on my faded brow his beams alight, I perhaps may feel his all-reviving grace.— May feel his influence in the blessèd spring, Rousing each little plant beneath the earth; Supporting o'er long seas the swallow's wing, Filling the universe with joy and mirth. And thou wilt keep my memory green and fair, And give thy daughter so beloved a tear: Well mindful to enwreathe, with tender care, Garlands of earliest flowers about my bier. I CANNOT SING MY LOVE TO THEE. He.— I cannot sing my love to thee In gilded words of minstrel lay: No chieftain I of high degree, That I this courtly meed should pay. But if I were a belted knight, And not a humble rustic swain, Think'st thou my love, so pure and bright, Would by the change one tittle gain? I vowed to strive with all my power, One morn, to win thee for mine own. That wish with each succeeding hour To me has hourly dearer grown. Without thee through the summer fields Disconsolate I roam at dawn: Without thee sorrow o'er me steals, Amid the ears of waving corn. Thy voice can soothe my heart's deep fears, Can all that heart's pulsations sway: It beats tumultuous when it hears Thy footsteps—known, though far away. I offer but my humble lot,— No riches or ancestral line: My love is all that I have got To lay before thy beauty's shrine. She.— The swallow to her nest will cling, While summer hours may last; And love will fly on fickle wing, When beauty's prime is past. And will, alas! thy love be sped, When youth has passed me by? (And as she spun the silken thread, The teardrop dimmed her eye.) Full many a youth a maid has won, Then careless rides away. She who can only love but one Is left to weep and pray. He.— I swear by every saint above, That walked as man this painful earth, That to the end shall burn my love, As pure as at its infant birth. And fear not while this love is true, That we shall be too poor to wed: Love can with richest dower endue; But what is wealth when love has fled? Were I a king, I'd all resign, Contented well to share with thee, Whatever lot might then assign The changeless, fatal, sisters three. Thus o'er the adverse waves of life, With patient heart and ready hand, Pass we together man and wife, Until we reach the wished-for land.” SPRING DREAMS. When dewdrops glitter from each brake, downshaken O'er violet-clustered slopes of sunny meads; Earth from her wintry slumber to awaken, When Phœbus urges on his fiery steeds; When soft the wood-dove loitering spring reproaches, But still while chiding feels 'tis nearly spring; When cuckoos' notes proclaim its blest approaches, And swallows herald it on lightning wing; 'Tis then that all our baser part subduing, That in our nature which is most divine Shines unalloyed—each sluggish sense imbuing: No hard realities our souls confine. We dream the days of heroes are not ended; We dream the lust of war and gain Is past,—an angry cry that long ascended, To clamour at the porch of heaven in vain; We dream that though dark thunder-clouds may rise, To scare us fainting from our toilsome way, That soon will sun-bathed summits cheer our eyes, Close on the confines of the brighter day,— That soon in this old world, worn down with sorrow, The tired brain, the wearied hand and eyes, Will find their rest, nor fear lest on the morrow Their toil's recurring cycle should arise. That soon the race of men will wiser grow, And seek, with ever nobler, purer aim, The mighty purpose of man's life to know, Untouched by folly, undismayed by shame. COUNT BERTRAND. I take thee down good sword at need, Damascus shalt thou see again; I whisper to my trusty steed That we must cross the main. Go, Seneschal! and tell from me Each vassal stout beneath my sway, That he who lists may sail with me, And he who lists may stay. Careless of life—a master stern,— I still will take but willing men; For whether one of us return Is past all mortal ken. I ween those warriors bold that were With my good sire at Antioch's sack, Are dead, or grown too old to bear Their harness on their back. A boy in years from Eastern fight I homewards came with great renown; And proudly rode a red-cross knight, In tourney and in town. Till this day year—a woful day For me it sure has been!— In listed fight the victor gay, I crowned Her beauty's queen. To me since then more dear than life, I asked that lady fair Last eventide to be my wife, And she refused my prayer. I have refused him!—throbbing brain, be still!— My duty to my sire at least is done: My happiness is dead before his will; My peace for ever gone! My fevered lips I scarce could bring to tell, The falsehood that should doom him to despair. His footstep as he left me rang the knell Of life's young hopes, and fancy's visions fair. Why did he not reproach me?—I had borne Reproaches better than that look of pain. Faithless he must have thought me, that could scorn That heart I had ensnared but to disdain! Yet sighs but ill-suppressed, and downcast eyes, The burning blushes to my cheeks that clung, Did when he told his love in witness rise Against the hard refusal of my tongue. He will forget me: he must bear his part In whirl of action—I in stillest days; One image ever graven on my heart, Death only shall erase. The Count of Tripoli, Sir Bertrand hight, Rules 'mid the Latin princes without peer: Wisest in council; foremost in the fight; The Paynims armies' fear. His massy broadsword, that men's sinewy hands Often to wield in air would vainly try, Doth hew its way through dense and trembling bands Of Moorish chivalry. Elected by the common voice to reign, Of his companion brother-knights in arms; One single acre of his wide domain Few foemen dare to harm. Before him, throned on high, are set The prisoners from some Arab horde: He bids them curse false Mahomet, Or perish by the sword. Their ransom from a chieftain near, By envoys at his feet is laid; They offer too, in doubt and fear, A shipwrecked Christian maid. She bows beneath her fetters' weight; They chide her faltering steps' delay: Count Bertrand grasps his chair of state— The maiden faints away. And this is not a dream! I clasp the prize For which my soul scarce dared to hope or pray: I gaze into the depths of thy soft eyes, And dream my life away. I feel upon my cheek thy scented breath; The beating of thy heart keeps time to mine. No time more blest for life, more blest for death, Than when Love makes our spirits half divine— When Love, triumphant over countless ills And adverse storms, securely lies at rest; And with a blest repose my being fills, At haven on thy breast. THE CASTLE. Long thy pride has fled, Thou art as the dead, Aged castle with the moat-stream nigh; As I roam through thee, Visions rise in me, Of thy splendour in the days gone by. Squire and belted knight, Who for England's right Murmured not in battle-field to fall: Now their armour bright, Tried in many a fight, Mouldering hangs upon their castle wall. Dames whose eyes of blue Well the witchcraft knew, Warrior hearts in durance to enthral,— Cheeks of softest bloom, Crumbling in the tomb, Now for ages dust and ashes all. Vassals stout and bold, Who through wood and wold Trained the falcon in his airy flight, Slipt the straining pack On the roedeer's track, Yelling in a chorus of delight. Babes around their sire, By that bright yule fire, Clustered thickly when the chase was o'er: Many a ballad sung, Through the rafters rung, Roused the sleeping hound upon the floor: Told how giant's might Wronged some princess bright, That in dungeon wept away her prime: Told how brave was he, Knight that set her free, In that legend of the olden time: Told of Guinevere,— Maid of fairest cheer,— Wooed by Lancelot in the lakeside dell; And when queen how shame Dimmed her noble name, Loving still his golden locks too well: Told how ghost and sprite Wander through the night, Till atonement for their sins might be; While the damsels wept, And the children crept Closer still unto their mother's knee. Visions come and go, When the sun is low, Flitting o'er me in thy ruins grey,— Till the mists of night Hide thee from my sight, As I slowly homewards take my way. A SCENE. Deep in the bosom of a lonely valley, Fast by the margin of a quiet lake, A cottage lay embowered 'mid many an alley Of yew and hollyhock and hawthorn brake. And kine and sheep were in a meadow grazing, Which gently sloped down to the water's edge: The trout there lazily at flies kept rising; A heron sat watching on a rocky ledge. The corn of harvest waved in plenteous token, As the breeze whispered o'er its bending ears: Inland, the mountains, ragged peaked and broken, Uprose behind in huge basaltic tiers. A maiden by the cottage door was singing— A boatman sang in answer far away; While myriad sounds of life through woodlands ringing, Murmured in unison a chorus gay. So fair the scene that once arose before me, In distant lands beyond the Eastern main, That a deep longing then for home stole o'er me, And scarce could I from childlike tears refrain. THE COTTAGE AND THE CASTLE. Sir Wilfred on his charger grey Adown the mountain pass'd; And watched the mists of early day Dispersing fly before each ray The sun uprising cast. He marked, where far below him seen, As fast the landscape cleared, 'Mid checkered fields of gold and green, Which slow the river wound between, A rustic cot appeared. He looked towards where a castle rose Abrupt from out the plain, Whereon the morning sun that glows Bright as some precious diamond shows Each oriel window-pane. “Within yon cottage dwells a maid; Her glance is like the dove; Her silken tresses' auburn shade, Like sunbeams in a woodland glade, In varying colour move. “As o'er that cot yon castle towers, So higher in degree, Is she to whom once in its bowers I plighted troth in childhood's hours; And now I'd fain be free. “I love that maiden poor and low, Beyond the treasured gold That haughty beauty shall bestow On him she weds, with lands that go By mountain far, and wold. “And I this morn will seek her sire, And tell him all my mind,— That riches pall, and honours tire,— No proud alliance I desire, Though Cupid may be blind. “A humble consort shall be mine, To her my vows be given; For her I'll wealth and power resign, And wed her by each rite divine, Before each saint in heaven!” A DREAM. I had a dream of bliss, that all my heart Filled with deep joy, what time the awakening dawn, All blushes, through a silvery veil of mist, Rose as a maiden on her bridal morn. Methought my love bent over me, and pressed My lips with kisses, till our beings grew One individual nature,—till each soul No separate existence felt or knew. A perfect harmony of varying chords, Notes that one sound in perfect concord seem; Two rivulets that come from different hills, Lost, but united in one common stream. A blessed vision of a hopeless love— A gentle dream to soothe a fevered mind— The passion of a lifetime, that in heaven Alone may hope accomplishment to find. O blessed vision! come again each night, Till death or age this mortal frame decays! And recompense with thy most pure delight The toils and troubles of life's weary days. THE COAST OF CORSICA. The seas subside, as clearer grows the air, And slowly rolls away the storm; The vapour-curtain lifting here and there, Displays a mountain's form. Soon torrent-cloven hills in distance loom, Snow-capped in long unbroken lines; Pine-darkened all their forests; deepest gloom Broods o'er their dark ravines. The summits of that chain far inland rise, Its bases fathom deep the seas, By solitary coasts, with icy skies, And winter saddened trees. The mountains' torrent beds that run between The pumice of their rugged side, Lie strewn with boulders water-rounded, clean, Thick o'er their channels wide. MORNING. Half-seen behind a vapoury cloud, Creeps on the infant day; But soon the mists her birth that shroud, Grown bolder, casts away. The morning air is sharp and still, No bird is yet awake; How hard in outline looms the hill That lies across the lake! Soon over fields and dewy meads Broad gleams of sunshine float; The bittern tunes from out the reeds His melancholy note. Near bulrushes with velvet heads The turf grows fair and green; Where dewdrops cluster bright the threads Of gossamer between; As if, those blades of grass among, That fringe the shore hard by, Some elfin fisherman had hung His tiny nets to dry. While dimly seen in plumage grey, More like some waveworn stone, The heron waits his morning prey, In silence and alone. Good hopes has he—the shallow stream Dividing shows the track, Where sails along a lazy bream, And shows a scaly back. NOON. The brook sings to her willows, Grey in the autumn breeze; The corn-field's golden billows, Keep time to waving trees. The kine within the meadow, The flock upon the hill, Have sought the poplar shadow, Or crowd the mountain rill. On the canal the barges, Glide lazily and slow; The opening lock discharges A sullen stream below. The windmill in the distance, With weary arms at rest, Courts not the wind's assistance That fans the mountain's crest. All nature seems reposing Beneath the noonday sun: The drowsy ploughboy dozing, As if his task were done. WINTER. The ivy only clothes the naked oaks, That moan full sadly to the wintry blast; That, asking pity from the hailstone's strokes, Lament the glories of the summer past: The summer past, whose dead and fallen leaves Lie dank and rotting in the watery clay; All nature tells, while she in winter grieves Of universal death and of decay. The sun in anger hides his cheerful sheen, And lurks behind slow-drifting showers of rain, (The sky all dark and lurid in between,) That scour across the long unbroken plain. Better the smoke and stifling air of town, The fever-haunted alley's narrow room, Than nature's death-like mien—a sight to drown All hope, and steep our souls in deepest gloom: Gloom that the life within us chills, recalling Griefs long forgotten, tears that long have dried; All healthful action's unnerved sinews palling; Sloth and dejection near us side by side. Our present ills hang leadlike on our soul, Too great to strive with, and too hard to bear; And far, far distant, seems the wished-for goal, That term and end of labour and despair. O springtide of the year! I count the hours Thou lingerest sighed-for by the icebound rill. Sighed-for in icy bed by snowdrop flowers, By crocus, and the amber daffodil! O, Southern wind! awake thine own pale child, Frail anem?ne in the woodland glade; And bid the violets that last summer smiled Greet us once more beneath the hawthorn shade. Then we our ills will conquer—blythe and glad, The spring will give fresh vigour to the mind; But when the soul and nature both are sad, Where shall the careworn mortal comfort find? THE EAGLE. An eagle was hovering over a fold, Of his brood at home thought he, On that dizzy rock by the avalanche cold, That by hunter's foot ne'er scaled could be. He swooped on a lamb like a flash of gold; The fairest he chose of three. He soared with it over the deep pine wood, And half-way up was he; And the sound of the cataract roused his blood, Like the martial strains of minstrelsy. Right up to the clouds, o'er the foaming flood, And over the green valley. In his fir cabin on the floor, The hunter at noon did doze; As the eagle flew past his cabin door, He snatched at his gun and rose. The echoes rang o'er fell and moor, And started the grazing roes. The bullet whistling sped away In the clear, still, mountain air. But the eagle ere then o'er the mountain grey Seemed like a mote in the sun's bright glare; And with sunlight's speed on a summer day Did the lamb to his eyrie bear. A FRAGMENT. [Fast by the side of that half-frozen ocean] Fast by the side of that half-frozen ocean, Whose rock-bound shores can give no sailor haven, Beating with angry spray against its barriers, Turning to myriad icedrops e'er it fall; While out at sea, close on the dark horizon, Like a gigantic dome of quarried crystal, An iceberg rises; and with stormy aspect, The sun is sinking lights the western breakers,— Here had he raised a solitary hut. An outcast from the cities and the haunts Of other men, he recked not of his fate; But loved the face of angry nature more Than man's most genial aspect. Deepest wrongs From kinsmen, and the world's relentless hate, He suffered patiently awhile: at length His wrath burst forth; and like those men of eld, Phocæa's heroes, who disdained to yield In servile tribute to the Persian boy, He swore that till the ocean on its breast Could float the molten iron's weight, that he Would bid a long farewell to other men; And leave them to themselves to wrong and cheat The fools who were content with them to stay. THE PARTING. The sun poured down a flood of molten gold Upon the still, bright waters of the mere: The wind was whispering 'mid the elm-trees cold, Sad skeletons that mourned the waning year. That wintry sun in splendour sank to rest; And as I gazed was all my being moved; And passion's deepest yearnings filled my breast, And made me sadly think on her I loved. 'Twas but last night I knew that my affection Most fast, most hopelessly, to her was given; Now she is gone,—and I in deep dejection, Feel, like yon sun, my sun is gone from heaven. 'Twas but three hours ago I held in parting Her hand, whose touch thrilled through my very soul; And left me, as a hopeless pilgrim starting Upon Love's road, who ne'er shall reach the goal. But three short hours—it seems to me long ages— Cold was the farewell that she bade to me. She loves me not; yet my poor heart engages, Hated, unvalued, still her slave to be. That heart has lost all bloom of youth in toiling, Unworthy of thy smile as bright as day; And my sad brow may scare, all pleasure spoiling, Thy raven locks and laughing eyes away. Let thy dear presence youth and beauty gladden, And carelessly in their first prime rejoice. I would not that for worlds my looks should sadden One tone, one accent of thy joyous voice. Though to be absent from thee is the sorrow, The death most hateful that I last should choose; Yet from the bliss of others I must borrow Dear thoughts of thee whom 'tis my fate to lose. Thy voice, like water heard in desert places, Makes music in the thirsty traveller's ear; Thy face, in this world's desert mine oasis,— When gazing in thine eyes all heaven is near. Alas, thou lovest me not! and yet how gladly Such mighty sacrifice my heart doth move; I'd live thy slave, thy menial, seeing sadly Myself despised, while others gain thy love. A GYPSEY'S STORY. Sate we by the wild camp-fires when night was closing round us fast; Rolled away the distant storm that murmured to the wintry blast; Dotted up and down before us, gleamed the plain with frequent light, Showing swarthy forms, and flashing eyes, and tresses dark as night. Lay thy brother near us; fitful on his long knife shone the moon; Slow he stroked a shaggy mastiff, as he hummed a sleepy tune. After thee thy sister fairest daughter of our mystic race, Fanned the flame, with lurid shadows flitting quickly o'er her face; While the hum of drowsy village, and the murmur of the brook, And the wailing of the elm-tree, as her yellow leaves she shook— Angry storm-clouds in the distance, and the moon's red gleams above— Fittest place and time best suited, thought I, for wild gypsey's love. For our tribes have nought in common with the other sons of men: With an origin alike and destiny beyond their ken. Here and there like motes appearing on the spanless tide of time— In all countries—in all ages—from this old world's infant prime— Still through centuries ever onwards pressing like the Egyptian Nile, Though the lands it visits know not whence it floweth all the while; And this Nile men say we came from—fabling idly as a dream, Cycles long our tribes had wandered ere our tents lay near its stream. Thus as long as time endureth shall we walk the earth: To the end uncomprehended and distinct as at our birth. And all this I felt and told thee, to my heart still nearer pressed, As mine eyes with pride dilated, as with passion heaved my breast. From all men this separation closer would our souls Intwine, And our perfect isolation yet would make thee tenfold mine. On thy cheeks were crimson blushes, roses of the torrid zone, By the orient sun's caresses bathed in warm and golden tone. Then, too, its emotions longer thy young heart could not contain, And, from mine embrace half-rising, thou didst sing a thrilling strain, Like the carol of the wild lark on its new-fledged pinions borne, Bursting all its tiny throat in ecstacy to greet the morn. And as I in rapture listened, heaven was opened from above, And the very stars seemed bending down to hear thy voice, my love! And I wished thou could'st keep singing ever, ever, so,— And I could be ever listening by the camp-fire's glow, Watching o'er thy perfect features all thy feelings' play— Eyes entranced, and ears wide open, drinking in thy lay; And I blessed those stars above us, rulers of this earthly frame, That my destiny had placed me here, to bear the gypsey's name. This and more I whispered to thee after that sweet tune.— Thoughts that to my son came rushing thick as swarming bees in June. But thy brother came behind us, and I raised me with a start,— And my hand his throat was clutching, while his poniard sought my heart. And amidst the wail of women, and men's curses deep and loud, Fled away all sense and feeling, and mine eyes did darkness shroud; Till I woke, and found thee weeping, for my wounds were dried, With thy brother dead beside me. Would I too had died! FIRST LOVE. There is a mound that rises near my home, And looks o'er smiling pastures far away, To where the eye can reach a distant dome, Catching the first beam of the golden day. There dwelt my first love. Thus in youth's clear sky, Some bright and radiant lodestar oft appears; And choicest minstrel's art in vain would try To sing the beauty of her tender years. Here standing, I would fancy,—love beguiled,— I saw her kerchief flutter from the tower; Then at my folly I half angry smiled, Yet still kept gazing on my lady's bower. Short seemed that distance, as I daily strode Through scented lanes and silvery birchen grove: Short would have been ten times as long a road,— Distance is nothing to the wings of love! And how will look the roadside flowering thorn, The blooming fern-grown hedge, and towering pine. How will they look, I wondered, on that morn When I shall pass to ask her to be mine? And then, I thought, if fruitless were my prayer, How sad, how dreary would the mayflowers bloom! But if she loved me, sunshine bright and fair Would lighten e'en the saddened yew-trees' gloom. O youth's dear visions! yet upon that mound I love to stand, although my head s grey, And watch yon sun the self-same journey bound, Shed on my lost ove's home his earliest ray. ENDYMION. The maiden goddess of the crescent pale, Now bathes in tender light the mountain peaks; And as, still mindful of her earthly love, On every hill her slumbering shepherd seeks; And ever and anon her virgin blushes She hides behind some little cloudling near, That runneth by her side; the winds she hushes, Lest they should jar upon his sleeping ear. The stars look down with cold, disdainful faces, Smiling, when heaven's pure Queen, too fond of earth, Stoops to dull mortal, who in her embraces Feels not her love, nor knows her kisses' worth. The sheeny wavelets on the mountain lake More gladly dance in ripples 'neath her light; More gladly murmuring groves their foliage shake; More fireflies gambol where her beam falls bright. Then wake, dull shepherd! Sloth and brutish crime, Our holier senses, finer instincts kill; And steep us in oblivion at the time When angels kiss us,—and we slumber still! THE RETURN. Well hast thou held, O gallant ship and true, Thy prosperous course, from shores of farthest Ind, With steady sails through leagues of waters blue, Still wafted onwards by the western wind. How strangely, England! do thy white cliffs gleam; Strange look thy breadths of pastures, fields of grain. In sultry orient noon, some pleasant dream Would bring such visions to my fevered brain. The quiet homestead, busy hamlet's sound, The murmur of the brooklet as it pass'd, Would cool my forehead, till I woke and found The air about me like a furnace blast. And now thy soft sea-breezes kiss my cheek, And whisper in mine ear their greeting wild; Like a fond mother they that welcome speak Who for long years has never seen her child. And now the coast and ocean fast recede, As I am borne along the iron road, Carried on wings of lightning by the speed With which the iron monster draws his load. I gain the valley where in youth I played,— The gable-ends—the long steep roofs of slate— Before the manor-house I stand afraid To pull the rusting bell-chain at the gate. The dreary echoes rise as in reproof, Clamouring against my oft repeated knocks; The pigeons fly astonished from the roof, The bees from rows of stately hollyhocks. At length an age-bowed porter, lean and grey, In vacant wonder opens to my call; With faltering voice, and mien half sad, half gay, He bids me welcome to my fathers' hall. Yet thinks he his young master wondrous changed, And says that he too has grown stiff and old, Since those bright days when we together ranged The lakeside covert or the mountain wold. Through panelled chambers, memory-haunted then, I wander now with pleasure, now with fear; And think that, though beyond my sight and ken, Those dear one's spirits still are hovering near. In village church of fabric quaint and old, Forlorn and desolate I kneel awhile; And kiss a name in characters of gold, Engraven on the pavement of the aisle. And then into a dreamy trance I fall, And think again I hear the morning prayer; And see those well-known faces round me all, That filled that church the last time I was there. Again before me rose that angel form, That used to kneel in adoration low, Where oriel colours manifold and warm, Strayed o'er her waving locks and snowy brow. Again, when church was ended, waiting there, I felt the pressure of her gentle hand; And on we wandered, scarcely knowing where, Of youth and love all in that golden land. And now I stand beside that same church-door, And watch two happy lovers passing by; And wish the sorrows of this life were o'er,— For death is rest to those who long to die. THE BARD. The bard is much too old for these young days,— A thankless age, and an ungrateful time, That when he fails can mock; but doth not praise If haply well he rhyme. The common things of life that hour by hour We pass as worthless can to him unfold Great beauty: Midas-like, his touch has power To turn them all to gold. Not only doth the wondrous present fill With images his brain; but clear and fast To him there floweth a Castalian rill, From times and deeds long past. Through the dark vistas of a bygone age Dim phantoms rise, awakened by his song; Pale ghosts repeat their wonted pilgrimage This world's great road along; And long-forgotten heroes from their shrouds Lift to the sun their mighty heads once more, And look as when the foeman's trembling crowds Shrank back their charge before. This world, too, teems with beauty; every leaf Is fraught with poetry!—a work divine! And every grain within the autumn sheaf Of exquisite design. Thus past and present—nature and the mind— Are fields where men may find a harvest fair, And reap, and gather ceaselessly, nor find Them ever waxing bare. THE DESERTED ONE. In the last bright days of May, When the spring was growing old, Heard I a poor maiden say, “Love is now but love of gold. “Sadly on my life has run, Peace and hope have kept afar,— Dreary days without the sun, Dreary nights without a star,— “Since that bitter, faithless time, When he came with honied vows, Came with falsehood and with crime, Which the world to man allows. “I, alas! believed him true; All my heart he did engage; Then methought this old world flew Back into the golden age. “Dreams of May! the spring is dying; And my spring has pass'd and gone: Shall I still sit vainly crying O'er his broken troth alone? “I will rouse me from dejection, And alone will life endure: Woman needeth no protection If her heart be true and pure. “Woman may work good unmeasured, All unaided here below,— And may leave a memory treasured, And revered by high and low.” THE VILLAGE SCHOOLBOY. My childhood in a quiet spot, A village in the South, was past: My parents at their humble lot Repined not, nor a better asked. I gained some knowledge here and there, Which chance to me had thrown, Then sallied forth one morning fair To fight the world alone. Reverses manifold I met; Yet still I persevered, Nor gave myself to vain regret, But hoped, and never feared. Till, after tossing to and fro On sorrow's ocean wide, I drifted to the prosperous flow Of fortune's golden tide. Then, after years of patient gain, And honours many won, I visited the cot again Where first my life begun. I bought the fields both far and near, And built a spacious hall, Where once that cottage did appear Among the elm-trees tall. And now in age I love to stray On summer evenings cool, And watch the children at their play Beside that village school; And think myself again a child The merriest of their band, With joyous voice and laughter wild In youth's enchanted land. THE MAGIC MIRROR. It was a traveller in Southern climes That to an old man famed for mystic lore Came, and desired to know if he could tell How fared his true love he had left at home; And what would happen in his after days. Gravely the wizard gave into his hand A globe of crystal, clear as dew new-fallen, And he might look if he must know the future; But warned him that 'twere better not to know. Then for an instant came a cloud-like film Across the stone's transparency, but changed Quickly to iris colours, and a form That rose surrounded by a rainbow zone. His breath came fast, and bounded fierce his heart. He saw her lovely eyes were wet with tears, Which dimmed those lustrous orbs, as when a cloud Hides the bright radiance of a frosty star. And thinner too had grown that perfect form,— Gone was its youthful roundness, and it seemed That care's dark shadow had gone o'er her heart,— That sorrow's breath had paled her ivory brow. And who is he that rises through the mist, And clasps in his most lovingly her hand? And wherefore on her finger is that ring To which he points? She looks as if she sighed. Then was the crystal darkness and a void— The youth would rush away: but now the seer Bade him imperiously to look once more. This time a battle-field rose to his sight; By moonlight and the glare of frequent fires, In miniature most exquisite designed Were all the horrors of that new-done fight. The placid upturned features of the dead, Half-smiling that their fight of life was over; While they whose wounds still let them linger on, Bore on their faces speechless agony. Crushed lay the war-steed 'neath a broken gun; The cuirassier who ever grasped in death The throat of his grim foeman, half alive, Who tried to shake away that dead man's clutch. Strange groups, and many figures—scenes of war. The features, too, of some of them he knew, That bent them low above a prostrate form, Whose head was turned away—a fearful gash Was throbbing in the fallen soldier's side. And now they raise him, and the face was turned Towards him, and as the moonbeams seemed to light Upon those death-pale features fitfully, But for an instant, ere the crystal darkened,— A fearful thrill ran through him—with a cry Of sharpest agony the youth sank down, And dropped the crystal in a swoon of pain. PROSERPINE AT ENNA. 'Mid amaranth and violet and crocus She with young ardour sweetest posies sought; And wandered ankle-deep in summer flowers, A form of beauty, fair as pictured thought, A daydream by ideal fancy wrought— Dark-eyed Proserpina by Enna's bowers— While swiftly sped the pleasure-wafted hours. All in that fairy myth of ancient story, Once known and loved by each Sicilian maid, Who sang it with that self-same scene before her, Upon her lover's shoulder half afraid; And with the same wild flowers her locks did braid,— Sang it in awe of Corè's grim adorer, Winding in fear her gauzy mantle o'er her. What time the distant earthquake's trembling moan, Or sound of subterranean thunder heard, Or flashing clouds that brood o'er Etna's cone, Would make her quiver like a frighted bird. At inner fires of earth's deep bosom stirred, Her heart quick beating 'gainst her tightened zone Wondering if love were sin, for which she must atone. With thoughts of those twain monarchs—dreadful gods!— Pluto and Vulcan, powerful to control The might of primal fire. Great ruler he Of hell's pale regions, and each shadowy soul. The thunder of the other's hammers roll From yonder, where the Isles of Lipari Like golden palaces float on the sea— On Corè wandered, heeding not that day The dying sun with tear-flushed cheeks lamented; Nor thought she that her mother would bemoan her In bitter anguish through the world demented, And seek her wandering till e'en Hell relented, And Ditus gave her back to pale Latona; Consenting that for one half of each year She should be with her mother, and on earth,— These are the joyous months of summer time, And nature then rejoices, gay in mirth. While she is absent, ne'er a flower has birth: The world seems all worn out with pain and crime, And winter reigns with hoar frost tricked and rime. EROS AND PSYCHE. Psyche slumbered in a golden garden, Eros watched her sleep with tender care, Suffering not the sun to kiss her forehead, Nor the breeze to stir her amber hair. Purest visions of delight and beauty Gave he, rainbow tissues, dazzling beams; Still contriving that his own bright image Should arise in her enchanted dreams. And she sleeps, while each succeeding wonder All her trancèd spirit thrills and charms. When at length they fade, her eyes she opens, With a sigh of bliss in Eros' arms. Sees her Eros' smile, and feels his kisses Countless as the snow's unnumbered flakes, Thinks her dreams poor shadows, faint reflections, Of the happiness to which she wakes. LETHE. There is a river Lethe, of whose stream Men who their pain and sorrows would forget, Must drink to make their past life as a dream,— Must drink, to wipe away each keen regret. They say the way unto its waters lies Through burning heat, and drought, and arid land: They say the fountain where its sources rise, Is choked with weeds, and silted up with sand. Intemperance, a dotard on a crutch, And two lean sons, Fever and Madness hight,— The old one shrinking from his children's touch,— Can guide us thither through the realms of night. Yet who would drink of its accursed tide, And leave an empty blank for what has been? The most careworn would find, if they but tried, In their mind's desert memories fresh and green. Are not our very beings and our lives Made up of recollections of the past? When, looking back, the drooping heart revives; For on some spots is golden sunlight cast. From these doth Hope renew her tirèd wings That carry on our souls from hour to hour. Come joy! come pain!—whichever life may bring, Who would forget, e'en if he had the power? CONSTANTINE PALÆOLOGUS. On, on, they press; but ill the gaping wall Restrains their numbers. Far as eye can see, Like swarms of locusts from the sea, the plain Their crowds rush onwards. In an hour or two Shall be enacted that great closing scene Which ends the line of Cæsars, and my life,— Which gives this city over to the power Of Paynim conqueror and barbarous hordes: Whose founder was the master of the world,— Whose splendour soon eclipsed e'en rival Rome, Her elder sister,—whom her emperors left To lord it 'mid the golden spires and domes, Where yon blue waters Europe intercept From Asia beckoning with her cypress groves. I hear the walls give way, whose massive strength Fired with presumptuous pride their builder's soul, And vain prediction that no hostile ram Nor engine e'er would rend their giant sides. Can walls of triple adamant protect A coward people and a worn-out race, That scoff at discipline, nor give instead A manly courage? Where I stretch my hand, Behold the stately palace reared by him,— That veteran general who the captured spoils Of Africa and Sicily and Rome Laid at the feet of an ungrateful king. O Belisarius!—Narses!—those were names Worthy the old Republic's brightest age; But now such heroes walk this world no more, And we have lighted on degenerate days. Behold the ample circle of the walls Spread out below me, many miles to guard!— How few true hearts within them! Lower down The Bosphorus seems fretting 'neath the weight Of the barbarian galleys, restless grown Not loving its new master. Far away I trace the dark blue Asiatic hills On to Olympus. 'Tis a glorious sight!— A glorious city!—Oh, how fair to me, Its father and its ruler, looking down Upon it with the eyes of dying man!— Upon it for the last, the last, sad time! Ill starred am I on whose unlucky days This chance has fallen—I that bear the name Of him who placed beside the laughing waves His new-built capital; a site that men Should envy, and revere the happy choice, And prescient wisdom of great Constantine. The first one brought the seat of empire here, Which I the last one am about to lose. What can I do? My followers are fled. Thrice have I stayed from flight their coward bands, That rallying, wavered soon, and fled again. This tedious siege has quenched what little fire Still lingered in the Roman soldier's breast; And so, perchance, 'tis better, as the fates Seem to ordain it that the Roman rule Should end when Romans shall have learnt to fear. So dies the empire!—and no fitter time Of death for me its master. I will veil My head, like Decius when he sought the spears That bristled on the hostile Samnite front; And I will rush upon the scimetars That hedge the Turkish despot's slave-girt side, And hew my way till numbers bear me down; And one at least of all this people here, And that the leader, will have died a death Becoming well a Roman and a king! PRIDE. Pride is not born within a thatchèd cot, Pride is not reared down in the valley green; But is beside an avalanche begot, Above some dark ravine. Grown big, she lords it 'mid entrenchèd tower, Her henchmen guard with hushed and whispered breath,— Her jealous eyes continually lower, To punish slight with death. Yet doth she writhe with self-inflicted pangs, Though lapped in ease of the luxurious East; The sword of Damocles suspended hangs Above her at each feast. While still she fate or providence will blame, When all to her desire is moulded fair. Healthful to outward view she feels her frame Consumed by eating care. The more she hath, the smaller deems its worth: She sends forth armies craving conquered lands, Most wretched when the reins of the whole earth Seem given into her hands. Still to be higher makes she ceaseless moan: When she the highest place on earth hath trod, She'd place, like morning's fallen child, her throne, Above the stars of God! THE PURSUIT. Upon that river's banks the sunlight fell, On either side athwart an armèd band. A knight that to a maiden bade farewell, Knelt as he kissed her hand. “Where is thy boasted valour? Is the stream Too broad? or doth yon foeman's dark array Unnerve thee? Better fly than madly dream This precious hour away! “Good knight and true I deemed thee—deathless shame To hesitate to die in listed fight: A death each ancient grandsire of thy name Had welcomed with delight. “Their glory touches not the dastard sprung From those great warriors whom the after time Shall count as heroes—names that shall be sung In future minstrel rhyme. Moves not my captured sire's most evil case? Shall not one blow be struck, one man be slain? Rescue him straightway, or his daughter's face Never behold again! What though their numbers be as ten to one, And theirs the vantage of the stream's dull power; This will be equal once the bank is won— Waste not this precious hour! Plunge in at once, and if the current broad May haply sweep thee down to glorious death, I'll mourn thee, as a widow mourns her Lord, Until my latest breath. THE VIKING. And old Osric Stood on the prow of his ship, and watched the long wash of the billows— Chieftain greyheaded and tall: then clutched he his battle-axe tightly, And his old heart beat high as he heard the dull roar of the iceberg, Tearing the rocks from the cliff that hung o'er the neighbouring ocean. Proud was his look as he gazed, for his fleet lay at anchor beside him, Riding the angry seas, by the storm-beaten mountains of Iceland,— Tracks of grey stone and of snow—sharp summits and pine-covered valleys, Where, in 'mid downfall arrested, the cataract froze on the hill-side. Strange and mystical region of fierce volcanic commotion, Jets of loud-roaring steam, and the lava red-hot from the craters, Cooled into phantom-like shapes, that loomed far away in the distance, Horrid, portentous and grim, in that dubious, glimmering twilight. Which seemed not night nor yet day. Above him, in splendour unearthly, Flashed the red lights of the north, and illumined for miles to the Inland All that mysterious land in its barrenness and desolation. Still the old Viking's glad heart rejoiced as he gazed on the landscape: Dreary it seemed not to him, for he loved all its dark sterile wildness,— Loved to consider its grandeur, and watch the rude force and convulsions, Heat and cold when they met could work with resistless enchantment. Soon then he called to his fair-haired grandson, who straight at his bidding, Swift as the whaler's harpoon, or a star that is falling from heaven, Glided adown from the mast where he watched the grey bear and the walrus. Then to him spake forth his grandsire: “I feeble am grown and stiff-jointed; Yet the time was when this coast has all rung with the fame of my exploits,— Surely my days now are scanty, and I must be gone to Valhalla. Soon must I cross the dread gulf that Bifrost the rainbow o'erbridges. There shall I mingle in welcome with souls of my fathers heroic, Draining deep horn-draughts of mead in the banqueting halls of the blessed,— Mixing there each happy day in the battle-field's thrill and excitement. Yet ere I go, boy! I charge thee, by all that on earth thou dost cherish, Wouldst thou attain to Valhalla, hold fast to the life of a Viking; Cities and their golden ease despising, let ships be thy dwelling, And make the pale foemen dread the speed and the scourge of thy Dragons; Let many widows and orphans long tell in their weeping and wailing, How large a cairn didst thou raise to the dead that resisted thine inroad. Thus must thou rival thy sires,—thus live a wild life of exertion, Life of the Asar-born, most worthy and fraught with enjoyment, Energy, action, and strife in the midst of the grandeur of nature,— Here best displayed in the forms that best should incite us to valour,— Firm as the hammer of Thor who crushes the ice of the hilltops, Firm as the hammer of Thor, which rendeth the rocks in the valley, Be the strength of thy sinews for war, yet undaunted thy brow in affliction. Thus shall the gods well approve thee,—the war-loving gods of the Northmen. Thus if thou swearest to bear thee, most gladly I'll get me to slumber,— Get me to far spiritland, right assured that I still leave behind me One of my blood and my kindred well worthy our line to continue. RIZPAH. Here have I sat three dreary chilling nights, Here have I sat three burning summer days: My haggard look each passer-by affrights, Mine eye glares wilder as my strength decays. The Gibeonites have on these sons of mine Exacted vengeance for their slaughtered race, And left Saul's offspring,—king by choice divine,— Like dogs unburied, for a grave too base. O my brave sons! how has the hand of death,— The dews that fall e'en thicker than my tears,— The fierce sun's glare,—the simoom's furnace-breath, Effaced the glory of your youthful years. See like a mote upon yon sun's red eye, Above the sandy ridges drawing near, The vulture shrieking comes with greedy cry, Led on by hunger, kept aloof by fear. And bands of mountain foxes lurk around, And troops of ravens borne on dusky wings, In concert ominous cry food is found; And insects goad me with their hundred stings. 'Tis sweet, though sorrows thick around me throng, To watch the footsteps of the morning still Glide modestly as if in fear along The trellised fretwork of the vine-clad hill. By citron alleys, onwards towards the deep Clear ocean, stealing past the dew-fed lea; Like some fair nymph new wakened from her sleep, Would bathe her half-ashamèd in the sea. While in the east that golden bank of cloud Seems like the rosy couch she just has left, 'Tis sweet to gaze; though sad affliction shroud My fevered brain, of half its sense bereft— That fevered brain, to which no gentle sleep Restores the ebbing strength that hourly wanes; Yet I my watch will by these dear ones keep While still one spark of consciousness remains. The miseries I in their cause have borne, Shall never be forgotten, but shall prove To far-off men, and ages yet unborn, How deep is mother's grief!—how great her love! NIGHT. The moon to-night is alone in the sky, Alone with one bright star. Which, methinks, doth gaze most tenderly Upon her from afar. Silvery trees and meadows are asleep Beneath her well-loved ray: The dappled clouds about her slowly creep, Yet night seems almost day. And now she wears a halo round her head, With watery import fraught,— A sign the mariner soon learns to dread, When by the tempest caught. And her beams glide down the old church vane, On to a new-made grave; From the painted saints in the chancel pane Strange shadows flit and wave. And her face as it looks from the sky's far realms, Says, Rest from care and fear; For the wood-dove sleeps in the whispering elms, And the swan is asleep in the mere. CIVIL WAR. War approaches! War upon the whirlwind Sitting, shakes the world with thunder voice; And the warning of his dreadful accents Bids mankind no more on earth rejoice. Gorgon locks hang matted o'er his forehead, And his jaws with clotted gore are red: One hand clutches fast a brazen trumpet, While the other grasps an infant's head. From his fiery breath the reapers flying, Leave their corses of his track the signs; Tramples he through harvest-golden corn-fields,— Crushes he through cluster-laden vines. Death and misery and desolation Make poor men, in frenzied panic wild, Rend each other like brute beasts asunder— Limb from limb the father tears his child. Honest labour, intellect and virtue, Hide their heads despised in stormy hour; Strength, sole self-elected arbitrator, Copes with cunning that would sap its power. Phantom dark! by all the gods abhorred! Civil war! the direst curse of men,— Mayst thou never, suicide of nations, Visit this our weary land again! THE GARDEN. The flower-beds where now spring forth the snowdrops Have bare and dreary all the winter lain; The formal hedges of the box and cypress Have lived unchilled through frost and ice and rain. The sculptured urns upon the terrace side Shall tricked once more with gaudy colours shine; The gloomy sun-dial on the close-mown lawn Shall have its base enwreathed with eglantine. The doves are basking in returning sunshine, Upon the slated roof of that old pile: The very statues in the stately garden Upon their pedestals half seem to smile; As if they felt that the ungenial winter To realms of arctic yearlong ice had flown; They smile, where dark green yew-trees are contrasted Against the dazzling sheen of Parian stone; They smile when wandering beams of mellow sunlight Across their clear-cut passive features stray; They laugh through tears of heat-dissolvèd icedrops, Which Phœbus chases from their cheeks away. Here Aphrodite, gentle goddess, rising From ocean's rosy foam in grace divine, With one hand seems to dry one little tress, Dashed with the spraydrops of her native brine. Here by the Ionian's faultless chisel raised,— Sublime conception of all art and truth,— Stands Bacchus, whose immortal brows for aye Blush with the glories of perennial youth. Thus is the garden glad when spring approaches, Spring too man's soul with new-born courage warms. Then he with strength renewed, and brighter comfort, And lightened heart, his daily task performs. THE ARTIST. Divine expression doth pervade and fill Those visions which imagination charm! Alas, my baffled pencil, feeble skill! Cannot pourtray the beauty of one form! I feel their grandeur as they come and go Across the limpid mirror of the mind; Each lineament, each outline well I know,— And how harmoniously is all combined! Yet oft as I essay to reproduce Those gorgeous images that haunt my brain, Each fresh attempt will prove of little use, Till toilworn and dejected I refrain. And yet how glorious is the painter's task, Although his work ne'er equal his desire, If he do something to uplift the mask From art's deep mysteries, and still aspire To give some far-off likeness,—faint reflection Of the ideal to the outer world,— To show 'twixt mind and nature the connexion, A hidden scroll, perhaps ne'er to be unfurled! A giant's labour; for, though will be strong, Frail are the means on which great art depends; And many men have toiled their lifetime long, In fruitless strivings for such mighty ends. SHIPS SPOKEN WITH. 'Tis sweet when, many days from sight of land, Still slowly onward borne by fitful gale, On the horizon o'er the restless waves In golden sunlight we descry a sail. The ships approach each other, like two friends That after years meet on some desert road,— A trackless solitude, where human face Is welcome, miles away from man's abode. We ask them whither they are bound, and whence They sail from; feeling from our common plight Drawn closer towards our fellow-mariners, We greet them with affection and delight. They to our land are bound perchance, and we Are sailing to that country whence they come: With messages and letters interchanged, Each bears some tidings to the other's home. Then part the ships asunder, each her way To plough alone the foaming surge along: We in the solitude of the great sea, To keep our hearts both resolute and strong. We watch them in the distance as they fade! And from them towards us eager eyes are bent. We think our loneliness has darker grown, To which a ray of light their coming lent. THE WEDDING FEAST. A FRAGMENT. Notes of sweet melody, music entrancing, Float on the breast of the Tigris to-night; Silvery waves in the moonbeams are dancing, Timing with strains from yon palace of light. Heavy with spice and with perfume o'erladen, Breathes the soft wind that from Araby blows; Flushed is the cheek of the slumbering maiden; Hushed is the bulbul, and folded the rose. Chorus of revellers borne o'er the waters, From that high banquet-hall, fretted with gold; Bright as the eyes of fair Ispahan's daughters, Glitter the gems in the goblets they hold. Like to some vision in slumber's delusion, Over her shoulders of ivory thrown, Sports the wild dancing girl's hair in profusion, Fair as young houri from paradise flown. Light as gazelle on the plains of Bassora, Grace in each movement and beauty expressed. Loosely her mantle of gauze floating o'er her, Rises and falls with the heave of her breast. With music and dances the Chalif is wedding Ayesha his child,—fairest rosebud of May,— To the love of her bosom, the peerless Noureddin, Matchless in feature and bravest in fray. But as he entrusts to the bridegroom his treasure, He whispers of warning one word in his ear:— “While this thy young love doth abate not its measure, I give her to thee without sorrow or fear; “But if ever the clouds of dissension shall gather Between ye; if from her that love be estranged— May the curse of the Prophet, the curse of a father, Wither up thy false heart, that so quickly has changed. CRŒSUS AND SOLON. Once within his house of treasure, In an hour of kingly leisure, Crœsus told his riches o'er,— Counting them with eager pleasure, Almost more than he could measure, Molten gold and golden ore. At the sight his heart dilated, To his courtiers by that waited,— (Wisest men of all that age)— Spake he: “Bring that stranger hoary. Solon shall behold my glory,— Lawgiver of Athens sage.” So without delay they sought him, Found they Solon then, and brought him Straight before the king. And he showed him, naught concealing, Chambers piled from floor to ceiling, Showed him everything. Drinking cups with cunning chasing, Garments wove with varied tracing, Armour rich inlaid, Jewelled shrines from sacred pillage, Spoils of captured town and village, There in order laid. Crœsus spake: “All this I show thee, O Athenian, for I know thee Wise beyond thy peers. Of thy wisdom and thy travel Fit this problem to unravel, Fame has reached mine ears; Seeing of all men the races, Comest here from great Amasis,— Second he to none. Who, in all thy observation, Among men of every nation, Happiest is beneath the sun?” “Tellus the Athenian,” said he; “Strong and virtuous children bred he, In a country free; Many a grandchild saw around him And when death approached it found him, Blest as man could be; For his glorious life he loses 'Gainst the people of Eleusis, Whom he'd put to flight. All the state great honours paid him, In the self-same place they laid him Where he fell in fight.” Crœsus angry, and in wonder, Asked him in a tone of thunder,— “Who is next of men?” Thinking he would sure the second Happiest man on earth be reckoned. Solon answered then:— Cleobis and Biton, Argives; Prosperous most truly are lives Which like theirs are spent. On sufficient means most wealthy, Fair in form, in body healthy, Lived they with content. Both these in the games victorious, Oxen-like, with strength laborious, Drew to Juno's feast, Sitting in her car their mother; Halèd by each lusty brother, Forty stades at least. And when that great feast was ending All men stood around commending Those that could sustain Toil men ne'er before supported. But she, with great joy transported, Went into the fane, And before the image kneeling Prayed she for her sons, appealing Blessings in her pride. But that feast, they, after keeping, In the temple while asleeping, Woke no more—but died. And we learn on this relying, That for them 'twas better dying, Saved from pain and harm.” Said the king, his anger rising, “Thou, my happiness despising, Givest twice the palm To these low-born slaves thou deemest Happiest! Verily thou seemest Nought to honour me, Daringly of them thou pratest, Thus to Crœsus, far the greatest Of the Mermnadæ!” Calmly then replied the stranger:— “Monarch! thou art still in danger While thou art alive. Mighty crowns to nothing crumble; And the God delights to humble Men who greatly thrive. Of our lives the days are many, Twenty thousand, perhaps! Are any Totally the same? Some may bring us joy and gladness,— Some may bring us pain and sadness! Ruin dire and shame! Thus is man the sport of fortune. Therefore, King! do not importune Me to call thee blest. Though thy subjects be unnumbered, And thy stores with riches cumbered, Ere thou safe dost rest In thy grave, as happy dying, As thou hop'st, to life defying Fortune and all ill. For as no one land produces All things for our different uses, Every want to fill,— No one man with all things blesses Fortune: Those she most caresses Often end the worst. To them glimpses of contentment Shows she—then in quick resentment Makes them trebly curs'd.” Solon, when he thus had spoken With of favour not one token Crœsus forth did send. And in no respect did hold him, Ignorant too,—when he told him, “Look well to the end.” CLOUDS. A FRAGMENT. How fast the clouds across the sky are floating,— That sea of ether which for aye abides; O'er spanless depths of purest azure sailing, In feathery banks with swelling sunlit sides. Methinks that here and there the Seraphs ride Their milk-white chargers, with their eyes of flame, (That curvet, arching high their necks with pride In triumph o'er this fallen world of shame.) They ride as messengers through realms of heaven, To say that God in vain with earth has striven. We watch them speeding on with stately motion, As if nought here could move their even course, Nor aught of human passion or emotion Of pity could from them one raindrop force. Yet love they mortals far above their worth, Clouds that weep sometimes o'er a sinful earth, Clouds that drop dew upon a wicked world, And oft keep back God's bolts that should be hurled. THE HERMIT. There is a rest which passes human thought,— There is a garden free from weed or care,— There gleams a mansion, gold and ivory wrought, Meed of pure hearts, the saint's appointed share. We faint, we strive,—some angel leads the way,— Faint seraph music beckons us to go Long past the rosy beam of waning day, Above the furthest mountain chain of snow. A dream—'tis past—I waken in my cell. How bare it looks after that glorious sight! Patience! weak fool! 'twill last thy time full well, A few short watches of this earthly night! A few chill nights, a few more toilsome days, And then that end, long prayed for, sure must come,— A crown whose leaf of amaranth ne'er decays, Eternal peace, an everlasting home. These flags are polished by my endless prayers,— This crucifix my kisses have worn down. O my Redeemer! whom this sad tree bears, In that great day condemn not with thy frown! That day of wrath!—and am I worthy yet? My flesh is base and miserable dust,— My sins too deep for thought, beyond regret; But, all unworthy, still in thee I trust! FOR ONCE AND FOR EVER. For once and for ever be the word of parting said: For once and for ever let thy kiss to me be given. Once is for men, but for ever for the dead; And our love, fairest dove, full sorrily has thriven! Once and for ever—the forest leaves are green: They die, but next year will be budding forth again; While withered love no second spring has ever seen, And they who sever once in love for ever part with pain! May those sweet hours, like withered flowers, whose perfume lingers still, Embalm their recollection for the after years to come. Our blossoms of existence have been nipped by frost and chill; So for once, and for ever, I will gaze upon thy home. The years shall pass, those years of men, when life is best and fairest,— I cannot fight the fight of life, of life's best joys bereft: O give me but one blossom of the jessamine thou wearest, To be one relic still of thee, my only relic left! They say that men have struggled on, with crippled heart and limb, In the bustle and excitement that the hurt is scarcely felt. It may be I will try it;—but above the forest dim, The three stars shine, with light divine, in old Orion's belt. It is the hour of parting, for the night two-thirds is spent: The daybreak must the story of that parting never tell! This once I have loved, but for aye my heart is rent; So once and for ever, a sad, a long farewell! “MONUMENTUM ÆRE PERENNIUS.” We, whom the thirst of glory deep has smitten, Though vilest ashes and most fallen clay, Upon men's hearts can leave our story written, Undying annals, when we pass away. A record firm is ours, for aye enduring. The bronze or marble statues of the great, Their living selves half back to life conjuring, Doth age wear out; but honour hath no date. Great men have died, and left not one memorial, In civic glory, martial clarion's breath! A sun each evening sets, although the oriel Reflects not always his red hero-death,— Shows not the splendour of his dying gold, That gleaming panoply, as armour bright, The limbs encasing of some warrior old, Whose life is ebbing, after glorious fight! They too are truly great, though unrecorded May be their deeds, whose steady, constant lives With one fixed purpose always have accorded: The fool at countless projects ever strives. Great talents, and a power of all achieving Are shoals and quicksands in the lives of men; And they know nothing well, although believing All knowledge not too boundless for their ken. Fame is a slippery mistress; changeful fortune Hath wrought for mortals many a spiteful thing. He liveth best who little doth importune The gods, content with what his fate may bring. ON A MOUNTAIN. Pine-woods blue that clothe the mountain, Sunbeams pierce not oft your shade! Bilberries guard each fern-grown fountain, With its miniature cascade, Where, through moss its waves distilling, Trickle on, a runnel filling. Wild the air around me sweeping,— Wild the note the heathcock trills! Wild the snow-fed torrent leaping, In a hundred diamond rills! Here the breath of freedom reaches: Nought but sloth the valley teaches! Here may grow some fairy blossom, Fragile form, of colour rare, Nestled in a snow-flake's bosom, Only born in finest air, Deep among the birk and heather, Little recking wind or weather. Who would live in pent-up valley, Where the sunrise comes but late?— Who in reeking town or alley, Making gold and marring fate, Spoiling life, that comes most pleasant To the humble mountain peasant? CONTENTMENT. Thou would'st have endless sunshine: thou abhorrest The slightest touch of unaccustomed ill! Lurks there no gloom beneath the pine-grown forest? Hangs there no night upon the deepening hill? Look well around thee—all the far horizon Is blue and clear as laughing beauty's eyes; Save one dark spot the tiny clouds arise on, From which the thunderstorm will spread the skies! Would'st thou deem spring so fair, if uncontrasted With dull grey morn, and winter's drizzling rain? How sweet their food to lips that long have fasted! How welcome happiness that follows pain! Thus life is one continued alternation, Its antidotal remedy of joy Sorrow brings on—the soul requires temptation, To weld its metal, strengthened by alloy. AGNES. O thou hast mourned enough, and more than measure, In thy despair! Rivers of weeping call not back thy treasure, Nor floods of prayer Save thee no tress of all her golden hair! Be patient and put on A cheerful mask; Make firm thy will,— And soon the sense of ill Will lighten in the task. Nature you tell me doth herself renew, And grief wears out as wound or hurt will do; Still must the scar remain! Nature renews the flowers each spring,— The selfsame flower she cannot bring To life again. One blossom flowereth not two separate years; The death of winter changeth all—and fears Have I, that never through that long hereafter May come my love's bright smile, or happy laughter,— That lives but in the past, or in my dreams, In wafted music from the meadow streams, Where gaily once our boat on every wave went, Gliding along a waterlily pavement, That enamelled all its track; But now our boat lies wrecked upon the strand, And now the stream of life is choked with sand! Ah! who can bring the waterlilies back? THE PHANTOM BARK. Twin sails are in the distance, Scarce heard a boatman sings: His pinnace lightly skims the foam, As borne on swallow's wings. There comes a whisper down the breeze, A murmur faint and low: That she is bound to a far-off land, But where she scarce doth know. Beyond the Straits of Hercules, She maketh for the west, Beyond the far Canaries, To the islands of the blest. Those islands of the blest must mean A grave in the Western sea; No more, I ween, by mortals seen, That frail, white, bark will be! PRÆTERITOS SAPIENS HAUD RESPICIT ANNOS. Linger not! the years behind us Loom as some deserted track; Strewn with memories, like pale corses: Wherefore, comrade! look we back? We must onwards, though the sunstroke All our strength and manhood sears; With no fountain, save our sorrow,— With no river, save our tears! Like a frosty night, affliction Withers all the April flowers; While the rosy-cheeked Aurora Weeps with her attendant hours! Sorrow mars the bloom and brightness Of youth's glorious opening day,— From the morning of existence Wipes the gossamer away. And as rots a tender peach-side, Where the lightest touch has been; Life's decay, and life's corruption, Work the surer, though unseen. A COMMON LOT. In a mean and squalid attic, Far above the city's din, Lay a miserable woman, Fever-pallid, fever-thin. By the couch sat Death a-clutching At his spent and failing prey; And she felt his clammy fingers, And with broken voice did say:— “Yes, my poor breath will hardly last till morrow: The evening chimes across the housetops sweep. I am too near the end of all for sorrow; I am too near the end of all to weep. “Yet those few happy hours will rise before me, To mock my dim and ever-darkening eye— They pass'd, God knows, full soon, and night comes o'er me: I have known happiness, and now must die. “For that brief happiness the world will chide me, And name, disgrace, my bright and sunny day! False, heartless world, that pity hast denied me! I least am bound to heed what thou mayst say. “Ah how that cottage rises to my vision,— One of a dreary and an ill-built row, Where sacred things were treated with derision; How, taught like this, my duty should I know! “There was no church for miles and miles of moorland, Curses and drunkenness the Sunday brought; Small were the profits of our barren, poor land; Vice was the only schooling I was taught! “And then He came—and all was bright and golden, Dreary no longer was that dreary home; Enchanted seemed that gnarlèd beech tree olden, Where I was waiting till my love should come! “His rank above me, and his heavenly pity, Made me half ready for his sake to die; He took me with him to a distant city,— Small grief I felt from that sad home to fly. “The world will blame me; and the highborn lady Would shudder could she hear my dying plaint. Her heart, forsooth, is spotless, and her actions Are pure from any mercenary taint! “She perhaps through some time-hoary minster portal Passed on her wedding morn in jewels rare! A bridesmaid throng of loveliness immortal, Her steps supporting to the altar there! “She, from her parents' side there kneeling, rises, While from the organ-pipes are anthems rolled— She swears to love the man she most despises, And gives her heart, and sells herself, for gold! “Far otherwise with me: intense, unmeasured, My love, the dayspring of a life was given! His smallest word, his lightest look, was treasured; His voice was music, and his kiss was heaven. “What could I do? I heard his pleasant laughter; What could I do? his kiss was on my brow: The world shall spurn me always—but hereafter, I shall be judged in mercy—though not now!” ARIADNE. INTRODUCTION. Can I, poor rhymer of this iron day, Rehearse thy woes, deserted nymph, in song, Tho' in the poet-breast ne'er dies away The echo of thy beauty and thy wrong? Fair antique muse, whose golden prime has fled! Might I invoke thee, could my voice but reach To where thou mournest thine heroic dead, By Tempe's vale, or lone Castalian beech. Thou writest fondly all their names in sighs; A flood of glory lights thy brow sublime; Anon thou turnest those great anxious eyes, On thro' the vast infinity of time. Rash task! I dare not—far too high the place For him who tries and perhaps who fails in doing. From him the awful muse may veil her face, May spurn in scorn such poor and humble wooing! Courage! above the purple Attic hills, Thro' broken temple shaft the sunrise peers— May thy God's light increase till it fulfils The noonday splendour of the vanished years! ARIADNE QUERITUR SOLA IN NAXO. The sad Ægean round these tempest rocks Lashes in dumb and passionate despair, And seething back again in mist and foam, Goes moaning o'er the shingles, that return, In hoarse and many voiced reverberations, The waves' less noisy ferment—yet not less The great eternal, all-creative Mind Speaks through their voices as interpreters, And ever still shall speak, while mortals count Time, years, or fleeting cycles of the world. These leave their echo as they pass away, In the dull plash of ever-rolling sea, Whose waves will carve memorials on the cliffs Of all their victories—those haggard crags That frown defiance, while destroyer Time Still rendeth them apace—and Time from us Hath surely torn full many things we loved. We in our grief think most on early times. The retrospective picture of old days Comes back as fair as seemed to childhood's eye Some rude untutored drawing on the wall, That pleased but by the brightness of its hues. That distant age, was really not so fair: The very distance with its power can smooth, Can beautify each harsh and rugged line. Thus likewise future time, to future men, Shall soften down the harshness of to-day, Until we loom as heroes of the prime To children ages hence. All things must change. We gaze upon the tinted clouds that fade While we are gazing; changeful are the waves, The ever fretful, ever gleaming waves; The shore, with all its countless diamond sands, Remaineth not two spans of time the same. All things are changing—change thou, my despair! Uncoil about my heart thy serpent folds! Thou rearest now thy monster crest on high, Borne overwhelmingly against my soul, As rolls yon full-grown breaker on the shore. This hateful shore with cliff indented line, Though once I thought it half a paradise! And scanty patches on its heath-grown hills, Where stunted shrubs and ill-grown juniper Give thrifty banquets to the browsing kid,— Here can the sun shine forth with sallow glare, And scorch yet more the blinding, shadeless sands, That seldom taste ambrosial showers of heaven, Or drink the nectar of the mountain rill. Here when the days are dark and overcast, For hours I sit and weep—around me flits The blue sea-bird, with everlasting shriek, In circles near and nearer, and I hear A far-off hum of old forgotten tunes, Such as my mother sang me on her knee, A little maid, my lullaby to rest. Peace! peace! thou shrill ill-omened bird of ill! Rest! rest! thou ever fretful toiling sea! Shine forth, O Helios, thro' the envious gloom, And lighten up this dark accursèd coast! Shed thy fair presence o'er these realms of night. Thrice-cursèd gloom, long, long delaying rest, Thou endless rest misnamed by mortals death, To these how fearful! yet to me thy face, Is fair as chariot of the golden God, Close on the haven of Hesperian rest, While his sun-horses sight the golden orchards— Ah, hateful once—how doubly welcome now! Come, cradle me in thy maternal arms! And press thy poppies to my aching lids Gentle as care-balm of thy sister Sleep! Respite of toil, and interval of woe, Sorrow's oblivion! Lethe of my pain! How doubly desolate! how all-forsaken, This present chance hath Ariadne left! Most maids afflicted still have kinsmen, friends, To dull and soothe the sting of present ill, By consolation, sweetest anodyne That grief e'er wots of. I am all alone,— Alone with the wild sea-bird on the shore, And long, dull murmurs of the heaving sea. Thoughts of my father and my native land Crowd in reproachfully upon my soul: His royal eyes austere, and silvery hair, These with their eagle glances, and the other With all the hoary, reverend majesty That age can lend them, chide his daughter's crime, Herald her want of truth, who left them all, Caught in the love-toils of the stranger boy. No more for me my pleasant home of Crete, No more my bower fast nigh the vineyard side, Where purple grapes their clusters round it trained, An interwoven damask, flaked with green, In richer tapestry than ever gleamed, Wind-rustled, in my sire's ancestral halls. Their tendrils fain would mingle with my hair, As, peering through them while a red sun died, I watched at eve full-bosomed stranger ships Beat into harbour, wondering in my soul How gallantly they sailed; and each new guest They bore to Minos' palace made my heart Pause in tumultuous pulses; and my thoughts, Fired with a girlish, half-poetic vein, Would blend their features to a half-resemblance With one dear face, seen only in my dreams, Which, though delaying long, must some day come,— Some day fulfil the fate of all my life. Thus sped my girlhood, happy in the sphere Of daily avocations, household cares, Sweet labours of the distaff and the loom, Delighting to enweave some grand old tale Of god or demigod, who walked the earth, Nor spurned the banquet that some hero spread, And deigned to quaff his hospitable wine, In days when men were heroes—heroes, gods. Or how the nests of robbers, pirate hordes, Or monster, spawn of some unholy deed, Found extirpation in the brawny arm Of some earth-cleansing Titan. These were themes Of which the Tyrian purple, myriad hues The thirsty wool from plant or flower drinks in, Gave fit presentment, as my maidens wove Around me in lone palace-turret, built, O'er groves of cypress, near the white town walls. Still came there ever gusts across my soul, Ruffling the even surface of my life. My father was not happy,—and at times, In middle banquet, or harangue of state, A shudder would pass o'er him, and his eyes Would stare whole hours with vacant, sullen glare, As if some horror others could not see Were ever in their vision. Thus, long since, When I, a little maiden, near him lay, In the still watches of a winter night, When all were sleeping, and he thought I slept, I heard him groan—anon he shrieked aloud, In his soul's anguish; and his royal face Changed all its outward semblance in its woe. Then murmuring, “Wife, wife,” suddenly he ceased, And senseless fell, a-swooning out of pain. My nurses too, as they together talked, And fancied I a child would scarcely heed,— Spoke of the doom upon a cursèd race,— Poseidon's wrath for sacrifice refused, Who rules with might those deities marine That throng the womb of ocean, with his spouse, The clear-haired Amphitritè, nymph surrounded, Called Oceanides,—her royal train, That play beneath the glassy depths of sea, Amid the flashes of the emerald rocks,— That laugh at Glaucus, ancient, uncouth god, Of bulk unwieldy, and o'ergrown with sea-weed. Thus spoke they of a sentence that had passed Forth from the high tribunal of the gods, Producing crime scarce dreamt of: which decree, By its mysterious influence, should mar The rising promise of a kingly line. A silent horror, vague and undefined, Crept through me as I listened; and I mused: They surely hint at us,—my brothers, me,— The family of Minos; but I said Nought of it, counting such things best untold. O curse foreboded, yet most undeserved,— O fate of the immortal, ruthless gods! Now have ye fallen for another's wrong, On me the hapless one, whom men shall call, “Deserted,” Ariadne by surname; Her ever counting as the most forlorn Of maids, whose only fault it was to love,— To take the dross of a false heart for gold, To count the lies of a false tongue for truth, And on false kisses waste her life away. In a storm-beaten galley, black as night, He came—the sails of his ill-omened ship Hung flapping down in sable folds of pall, Portended well his errand, and his guile— Black as the falsehood of their captain's heart, Dark as the serpent windings of his soul. He came, forsooth, to free the Athenian land From yearly tribute to the Cretan king, Seven of their youths, the fairest and the best, He in the count of that devoted band, Doomed to the jaws of a mysterious beast, The Minotaur, the dread of all our state. He came, and I that gazed upon his brow, Clear as the forehead of the archer god, Driving his sun-steeds in mid-air of heaven, That hurled rash Phaeton to endless woe, Through hazy realms of night, and caused to rise The amber fountain of the sister tears— I gazed, and loved the face of all my dreams; And I believe that for a short, short time, Love crept and nestled too in his cold heart, A pure fair light in a guilt-darkened land, Till, frighted by the circumambient gloom, He winged to Psyche's golden bower his flight, And fled for ever. But I trusted then, More than the evidence of outward sense, His faith—that now a sand-grain might outweight, Against it poised, in equal Dike's scale. There is a place of endless passages, Of windings without finish—fenced with guile— Men named it “labyrinth;” and here he dwelt, That fearful monster, author of my ill. Thither in festal march, to choral song, The Cretans led the victims of his rage, With dances, and with wreaths each year renewed. My time I bided till the rout had gone; And when the noisy festival was spent, And silence brooded sullenly and grim About the portals of the dread retreat, I, who knew all the windings of the place, And every turn of each perplexing maze, Placed in my loved one's hand the silken thread, To be his clew to where the monster slept— And braced his armour firm, and girded on His sword for the encounter; and our troth Was plighted in the presence of grim death, An imminent, sad Hymen of the scene. Ungentle scene for Eros, that reposeth Most often in the petals of a rose, Lulled by the Zephyrs to his baby rest. But as I sent him to the fight, I said:— “O dear one—lover—husband—if my love Could give the might that nerves the hero's arm, Then were the Minotaur an easy strife, Past all believing easy—and no more, No harder, than a common beast of chase. But think upon thy fathers—think on me— Thou art a prince, and son of many kings, Thy ancestors were heroes, and I'd fain Believe it for a thing impossible, That thou should'st lack one spark of manly soul.” He went and he prevailed—he brought me back The grisly spoils of triumph on his arm. Then took we counsel rapidly, and fled; Trust me, I feared the anger of the king, On that night's exploit—and I knew his wrath Keen and relentless as the bolt of Jove. I knew the pride of Athens galled him much; Her tribute paid with tardy reckonings, And insolently tendered. Pardon none, Could Theseus hope for at the hand of Crete; And whither he went I must also go— Love stifling duty in a daughter's heart. The twilight gleamed far down the jagged coast, The moon rose palely o'er the galley sails That thronged the harbour; and the boatman's song Came wafted through another labyrinth Of rigging and of cordage. There we found His vessel, and the sailors raised a shout Of gratulation, for they looked on him As a dead man new-risen from his grave. Well might we seem as an unearthly pair,— He with the trophy of his hard-gained strife, And I with locks dishevelled, robed in white, Like some lone Naiad when her stream is dried, Or maid more lone, with sight of nymph distraught, Or loneliest ghost, that flits about the spots That while alive it loved the best on earth. We hushed their boisterous welcome, lest their shout Perchance should carry to the palace ears Our nightly project. Silently and soon The anchor weighed, and caught a gentle breeze, That from the inland rivers, risen with sighs, Went whispering where the bright-edged ripples played, Outside the bar, in the fair even sea, That changed its blue to purple; while the sky Was all unclouded for the merry stars. So dropped we out to sea. The harbour waned, The lighthouse flame a single sardine stone, In the dark hair of ocean, that above Wore a fair coronal of graceful hills, Furrowed and ridged as is thy turret crown, Cybele, mother! that on Phrygian height Out-diadems the glory of the sun, Horizon-kissing. But I felt my tears, Then first—alas, how often after felt!— Break forth uncalled, in hot and bitter stream,— Tears of the heart—real tears of woman life; For childhood sorrows count I not for tears, Those rudimental lessons of all woe. I wept; for then as on the deck I sate,— Thine arm around me, and thy bright locks twined Full lovingly with mine of darker shade,— I wept to look across the breadthless sea, And realize, that henceforth I had left All, all for thee; and then a little doubt Came struggling into being through my soul, As yet a very infant, speechless doubt,— That since, alas! has waxed from baby growth, Till now it towers a broad, strong certainty,— That I perchance had risked my all in vain, And changed old things for new, that scarce would please, Nor bring me back a fair equivalent. Thou wert half angry that I then should weep: Thou saidst my tears were childish—most unkind— That such forebodings ne'er should vex that heart, Whose love was firm—and thou couldst more than fill The father, brother's place; so I was mute. And on we sailed through miles of liquid green, Empeopled by those denizens of sea; A dolphin troop swam frisking round the keel, And raced each other joyously along,— Now dipping through the small opposing waves, Now reappearing on the leeward side, Kept with our bark a livelong summer day; But unsignificant of coming storm, That, say the mariners, these creatures bring, Came gentle prophets of unruffled skies. The islets thickened round us more and more, Through wondrous vistas winding, sea with land Combined in fairest landscape went and came In endless alternation; and we passed New shores, new mountains, with fair terraced walls Of town or hamlet half-way up their slopes, Through pirate fear, to guard marauding wrong. Behind them inland towered the salient peaks, Fraught with one tale of old volcanic fires; Old fires still warming to a ruddier glow, The grapes along their vineyard-fretted side, That clambered 'mid a trellis-work of elm. Here olive-groves that hung in dizzy height, To listen to the ripples far beneath, Of a bright tideless sea, that by those crags Glittered a Danae shower. And island came Thick after island, fast as on the deck Changed the wild music of the sailors' song, Snatches of martial, or of softer strain. The changeful scenery of summer verdure Crowded upon us, rich beyond all thought,— Valleys of emerald, bays of myrtle growth, By waterfalls that gushed into the sea, Whose wakeful fountains rippled on; nor stayed The nightlong murmur of their babbling tide, O'er which the moon paused low, undimmed her sphere, Like argent buckler of the bowman god; And like his arrows came the shooting stars; And daybreak passed to fair and golden noon, And golden noon crept waning into night, In that short voyage, which of all my days I count the sole oasis of delight. Ah! would that life could always sail along Like a fair galley; would that joy could fill Our sails of fancy, and from lands of dreams, Would a sweet shore-breeze murmur us to rest, And bring us pleasant visions. Speeding thus, We might look down through far transparent depths Of purest azure,—we perchance might see The gambollings of Halosydne's brood Round Amphitritè, dread Poseidon's queen. Her golden hiding-place might be revealed, Where she sedately combs her locks, enshrined In cellular recesses of the sea. But such things only in enchanted dreams Are shown to eyes most blameless. Thus for hours We would sit talking of a hundred tales— A hundred tales, whose only theme was love, Who lights the secrets of the coral sea, And guides the courses of the mazy stars. Thou saidst that love was hymned in myriad names, Protean were the shapes that emblem forth The god, whom legends of the elder day Embody with the soul. Thine accents rang Sweet on mine ear as honey to the bee,— Came sweet as Hybla's honey, when she tastes The heather cup that crowns its purple side. Thus fled, as still shall fly for evermore The tread of time most rapidly, when set To the fair measures of a dream of love. Till, Naxos, o'er the waves thy shaggy front Rose cliff-encircled as I see it now, (But seemed far pleasanter, for then I looked With happier eyes, and all undimmed with care,) Ruggedly set across an angry sky, That frowned in sunset; and the ship was moored In a smooth basin of extinguished fire, That gave deep anchorage. A reef of shore Ran into sea around it: on the beach The aloes grew, a hedge of bristling spears; And in a double line behind them made The cactus its entrenchment. This the isle Of thee, great Bacchus! thy peculiar care. Here thou dost wander with thy Mænad train, (Vine-clusters mixed with tendrils on thy brow, In all their ruddiness, that seem to vie With the fair glow upon thy cheek divine!) Nightly o'er ridges of the inmost land, While through the haze and endless pinebrands' glare Loom great the shadows of the muffled hills, Dull rings the frenzied bacchanalian shout. The sails were furled, safe lay the vessel moored— The tents were pitched beside a pleasant hill, And we abode upon the shelving shore A week or more before the crowning woe. Thou didst thy tenderness redouble then, To lull the faint suspicions of thy guilt, That, notwithstanding all thy amorous care, Would, uninvited, creep across my soul,— Until the charm of thy seductive voice Would chase away those serpent doubtings back To lowest Erebus, among the snakes That twine the ringlets of the furies' brow. So all went smoothly, and we inland roamed One day before that fatal, deadly morn,— O'er mountains clad in grandest solitude, With leafy pine, or cedar gnarled with age, That when young saplings might, perchance, have seen That early race of men upon the earth, Mightier and better favoured of the gods. And some were hollow trunks, that sadly told By centuries their half-forgotten years. We sat alone in those eternal woods, That make man feel the creature of a day, A mote on time's interminable stream,— A hapless and a helpless human soul, Ananke driveth where it listeth not, Beneath whose iron distaff all must pass,— That uncontrolled necessity of Zeus, 'Gainst whom the master minds, the grandest men, That ever battled helplessly with fate, That ever struggled ceaselessly with ill, Were but as weak and vainly-wailing babes! Yet if 'twas written in those books of fate, Eternal, from all time, that we must love, And I must be deserted; shall I groan For what no earthly foresight could foretell,— For what no mortal virtue could prevent? There were more reason that I should invoke A retribution, Nemesis! from thee, Upon his faithless head; then with my tears The fierce Erinnys pray to mar his rest; And so despairing, with a mighty curse Against the whole Olympian power, should die! And yet forgive me, gentle gods! the thought; For some of you are kind, and some have felt The pangs of mortal passion—mortal tears. Be ye my champions! and forsake me not. But I must hasten to my story's end. At sunset, when 'twas destined that the sun Of my affections too should die from heaven, Down passed we to the coast, where near our ships At anchor gleamed the tents upon the shore,— And evening, azure grey, among the stars, Set in, here welcomed by the fireflies' dance; They, golden sparks, by endless myriads told, In mazy scintillation went and came, Along the reedy marshes, pools of brine, And past the murmuring breadths of rush and sedge; Athwart the saffron meadow; pastured slopes, Studded with scanty crocus; while o'erhead Patches of millet, sparing crops of maize, Checkered the mountain side, that further on Uprose abruptly into ridgèd stone. Then silence ruled the noises of the tents, The watch-fires glimmered fewer, and the wind Flapped at the drowsy sailyards in the bay. Sleep! hateful sleep! why didst thou spread that night Thy dream-bespangled web about my heart? Why didst thou dull my senses from all sound, To rob me, while I slumbered, of my love? Had I but wakened ere he stole away, He never could have left me; but I lay In dreams retracing faithfully the past— That past forgotten in our wakeful hours— And dreamt of childhood, and my Cretan home. And Phœbus flaunted high above the hills, And brightly came the ripples on the sea, Up to the far horizon, where there gleamed— O soul-consuming horror! death! despair!— The small dark sail of his ill-omened ship. Long time I swooned—the day was nearly spent When I came back to life—came back to pain. Ah cruel gods to let me live one hour, One moment, after all my hope was gone! And the last rim of scarce distinguished sea Had swallowed up the waning speck of light, That little, yet my all of Theseus left! A poor remain for love of passing wealth! Yet I could scarcely comprehend at first My utter desolation. Grief with time Must come to light, and dawn upon our sky, In all the naked wretchedness of pain— Must grow to largest bulk, and so with time Deaden again to sense of woe, less keen, But never wholly painless. Healing time, Canst thou do this? I own the task to me Seems well-nigh hopeless in the present height Of grief's severest fever; yet I'd fain Believe this magic thine; or I must roam For ever up and down this barren shore, For ever bruise my feet upon the rocks, For ever strain my eyes across the sea, For some deliverance that will never come! CHORUS OF SEA-NYMPHS. Peace thou disconsolate! Cease thy repining! For thee a glorious fate Parcæ are twining; For thee a godlike mate Chronos divining! Think not on him, the lost Hero thou mournest! His mind all anguish tossed, Makes him forlornest. Would ne'er thy path had crossed Him now thou scornest. Ample his punishment— Dire retribution. With his return is blent Heaven-wrought confusion. Ægeus to death is sent, By sad delusion. Yet in extremity From the All-healer, Comes forth a remedy— Time the revealer, This will unfold to thee Sorrow's repriever. Hear I the Bacchic shout, Over the hill trees! Pine-tops are whirled about In the divine breeze. Troups on the Mænad rout, Red stained with wine-lees. Thyrsus in fair right hand, Vine-leaves o'er brow, Aspect serene and grand, God-features show: 'Mid glare of pine-tree brand— Know ye him now? Thy fate the greatest, best,— But mortals die! For thee immortal rest Shineth on high. Thy stars a circlet blest, Seven, in the sky! LORD ULRIC. Draw near, brave knights and gentle dames,—come, listen to my lay; 'Tis a melancholy story, and sung this many a day; A ballad old, by minstrel told, in days of border fray. It was the good Lord Ulric, who forth one morn would ride, With a gallant troop of hunters, dight in gold and ermine pride,— A goodly show, to chase the roe, on wooded Yarrow side. Right merrily they passed along: the bugles sounded free. A stag they found, on elfin ground, a stag of grease was he: For there he lay a-sleeping, inside a fairy ring, But ere ever they were near him, sped, as lightning flashes wing. Lord Ulric spoke, a hasty oath (such often hunters say),— He would not flag, until the stag, he should have brought to bay. And it befel, he rued it well, or ever the end of day; For always he was riding, but no fainter waxed the deer. His comrades one by one fell back, and toilworn grew his cheer; But onwards, ever onwards, by forest, hill, or dale, He still pursued, till his good steed began to tire and fail; But ere its strength was wholly gone, they neared a sullen stream: The knight was fording over where right shallow it did seem, When, quick as falls the Levin-bolt, both man and horse went down, Through the rushing, icy waters, fathoms deep, but did not drown: For as he was he lighted on a pasture strange and dry, And a palace in the distance, all of pearl-shell, met his eye, While a strain of wondrous music, wafted through the portals, rolled, Came a band of damsels, waking music from their harps of gold,— From their ranks the fairest stepping, she who seemed to be their queen; For a coronal of rubies on her braided locks is seen; Took the warrior's hand, and led him towards her pearl-bespangled halls, Mellowed strains of slumber thrilling, like the distant waterfalls! There she lulls him in oblivion, knightly fame and all forgot: Murmurs reach his shrouded senses faintly, but awake them not. Long, I trow, may his companions search along the river side, Where his charger's last hoof tracked they, till it vanished in the tide; And his lady love may linger still unwed for many a year, While the water-fairy's music whispers gently in his ear! [Trust who may the lightning smiles] Qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem Sperat, inscius auræ fallacis. Trust who may the lightning smiles, Playing o'er the lips of beauty! Trust who may its artless wiles, Luring man from paths of duty. Shoals and rocks with peril fraught, To the vessel that would try them; I a sailor danger taught, Caution those that venture nigh them! Men are fools, and women worse,— Each to cheat the other trying: All their trickeries to rehearse Would send time to doomsday flying. Where o'er fields some terrace looks, Hermit-like I'll sit contented, With my tankard and my books,— Loves I never yet repented,— In an arbour, woodbine scented. There on some imagined fair I will write a careless sonnet; Though one jot I do not care For any face inside a bonnet. And should some old friend drop in: He my home-brewed vintage sharing, Makes his laugh with mine chime in At young fools for love despairing. THE PILGRIM. My dreams are over,—past each fair illusion; Old age, like eagle 'mid the feathered race, Among their airy flights has bred confusion; So now I'll rest me at the mountain's base. Lie there, old Alp-staff, trusty friend of travel, Our journeys here must end o'er stream and wold; Nature hath deigned few secrets to unravel,— One league revealed, her ocean breadth untold. Lie there, thou pilgrim sword; thy triumphs bloodless Are over vales and mountains—towards those goals I have not reached—my hopes lie sere and budless; And life and nature still are hidden scrolls! If I am weary, here I can repose me. That I am weary tell across my brow The drops fast coursing; and I will compose me To rest those wearied limbs, untired till now! Yet have I striven; and though but poor achievements Have crowned the zealous wanderings of my way, My sandals are worn out, and time doth leave rents In these soiled weeds, this pilgrim amice grey! Yet though I failed, although my best endeavour Have I on fruitless labour staked and lost, Hope I for rest, a saintlike rest, for ever,— A haven for the worn and tempest-tost. FRAGMENTARY PIECES BELONGING TO A LARGER POEM. THE KING'S MONUMENT. He died a king, and one whose mortal frailties Were manifold; and yet his people chose, With kind and reverent minds the ill forgetting, To rear this monument: for he had been Their monarch, father, and his imperfections Were but of earth common to other men. His virtues were of Heaven; and that fair angel Which the great master sculptured on his tomb, The fair ideal of all earthly beauty, The bless'd expression of celestial glory,— That stretches forth her hands, and smiles in giving A wreath, whose flowers in mortal garden culled, Emblem the amaranth of heavenly bowers. THE VETERAN'S RETURN. Methinks that I have had enough of wars; My limbs are weary, and I fain would rest. Old age should learn to fix its thoughts on Heaven— Not on the victor's wreath or captive's chain. Lie there, my casque; and thou, well-tempered blade, Forged at Damascus! thou hast proved thy might On those that wrought thee; now a long farewell! At least for me: but if some child of mine, Some far-off grandson in the after days, Should come to use thee—(Be his arm as strong, Nay stronger; but his heart as true as mine—) Then mayst thou be to him a sword of flame, Piercing, resistless, as the bolt of Jove. But season for such things has passed from me; War's harness ill doth case a withered form. O aged helpmate! well-tried wife! I come Never to leave thee more; I am returned Never to leave thee more in quest of wars. Late, it is true, and hard upon that night That round us both is setting in apace, And bringeth on the not ungrateful end— Peace after wars and resting after strife! Hard on the night and deep into mine age, Returns no more the lover of thy youth, Who, through the vineyards near thy maiden home, Whispered away the mornings of thy prime, But a worn veteran, seared with wounds and danger, Who fain would rest what time he has on earth! And ye, my children, bear with me, nor chide The fretful humours of a shattered life— And like an old man, when I talk too much, Indulgent be to failings of old age, Nor weary at the oft repeated tale. Nature to parents sends a second childhood, That children may repay them trouble spent Upon their infancy; nor will the task Be long or irksome: and when I have passed A soldier into rest—my grave shall be Beneath the tree I planted, when I came First home from conquest; but where I am laid May ne'er break in the thunder voice of war, Or sound of battle come to vex my rest, But smiling hamlets tell of endless peace! THE LOVERS' HOLIDAY. How pleasant in the solitude of love, To wander onwards thou and I alone, Through fields of hyacinth, and glades of bluebell. And then to rest us, where the distant mountains Carry the soul beyond their hazy peaks, Into a vast infinity of dreams. Reposing often with a fairy background Of summer woods, whose interwoven branches, The vocal birds above them, and the kine Grazing secure beneath them, much resemble A breathing scene of antique tapestry; But sweeter still to feel no inward strife, Latently jarring with each happy sound, Of most harmonious nature— O my life! My new-found happiness! Yet closer still Let me enfold thee in my guardian arms. Treasure beyond all riches! untold wealth Lies hoarded in the dimples of thy smile— A diamond store the flashes of thine eyes! The breeze is wearied with the bloom of May, And pauses perfume laden and tired out, Or fitfully reviving, breathes again. But I am never weary with thy love. O then approach still nearer to my heart, And bend thee o'er me, as yon hawthorn bends To kiss its image wavering in the stream— Narcissus-like, enchanted with itself. O bend thee o'er me, and this earthly life Will gain a foretaste of celestial joy— Will perhaps attain a glimpse of inner heaven! Love is immortal! Love can never die, And never had beginning; from all time 'Twas fated I should love thee; in my heart Long e'er I saw thee, was an altar raised As to an unknown goddess; and to me This love has been the dayspring of my life! BEFORE A STORM. The sun had found the sky without a cloud On its first rising, and with potent light Had flooded all that forest cold and sere, And half replaced the void by winter made. But now the scene was altered, for the day Begun too joyously and fair to last (Like some bright infant life, while yet in bud, Cut off in tears and death); for there are seen The violet woods all leafless, and the valley Reft of its lilies. Every larch and pine Sways solemnly its branches, as the heaven Arrays itself in mourning thunder-clouds. A horror fills our souls, and makes us share That silent awe which nature seems to feel, Like the presentiment of coming ill Before the advent of a mighty storm. Silence, unbroken, save a fitful breath, Lost and belated from its brother winds, That makes complaint through all the answering woods, Upon the rustle of unnumbered boughs. Surely in all its phases and transitions Nature resembleth much a thing of life. RAIN UPON WATER. Upon the pool the summer shower descends, The raindrops thickly on the waters playing, Like midges' intricately figured dances, Circle in patterns regularly formed. Or the clear surface seems a midnight heaven, With all its countless diamond stars upon it, Twinkling with tremulous, uncertain, sheen. RECORDS AND FORESHADOWINGS. Surely those ages that are gone before Have left their vestiges. Have not the tides Of lost primeval oceans stamped their likeness In continents, or deserts inland far? And rippled all the rocks, that keep their mark The same to-day as when, long cycles back, Each little billow rose and fell upon Their yielding sand. Likewise the future days, The times as yet unborn, can cast before them Shadows and indications of their rise,— As when, ere daybreak floods the Eastern heaven, A thread of gold, a bar of radiant light, Heralds the spot upon a murky sky, Where first the visage of the morning god Will flush the horizon and o'ertop the hills. A mighty fight sends harbingers before it, As dread and horrid as the meteor glare, Or comet deemed portentous of great wars. They who can watch the times with sober gaze, Unmoved by fancy, and unswayed by gain— Who let not wishes make their prophecies, Nor weigh too much their own peculiar fears— May gain much honour in the days to come, For foresight, wisdom's best and elder child. [I even saw the dusty roadside firs] An miseros tristis fortuna tenaciter urget? Qua merui culpa? I even saw the dusty roadside firs That kept their soiled black foliage winter long, Fringed with a lighter green by opening spring. The joyous birds had built their mossy homes Among them; and, methought, are all things glad? Each little bird returneth to its nest, And there finds welcome.—Whither shall I go? I am disconsolate, and broken-hearted! What have I done, for such a load of ill? Many ere now have suffered things like these, Deservedly—I know it; but to me They came uncalled-for by offence or crime. I hate to mingle with the jostling crowd; I scorn to use their paltry arts of gain; I have no outward varnish, and no show Of polished fair exterior to deceive: So men despise me, and companions few Of all my kind are left me; for the love Of woman best is lured by sounding names, And plumes and gilded trappings; so I'd fain Betake me to my rhymes, and solace find In spinning airy dreams, that bring to me Most blest companions of my solitude! THE ALCHEMIST. Whilom I was a knight, whose sturdy arm Hewed him a passage through the thickest fray; Of iron limb, and rosy-cheeked with youth,— One in whose soul the tales of chivalry Wrought rainbow-tinted pageantry of dreams,— One who would dare great deeds and feats of war, To gain the fitful tribute of a smile, Or please her lightest whim, who was to me The guide and lodestar of an erring life. But now my crippled prowess, unnerved might, Have shown the vanity of knightly fame, And fixed elsewhere the wishes of my soul. To solve the riddles of this teeming world; How the Almighty alchemist of all Hath wrought each pure elixir, and hath given To humblest plants most heavenly properties, To countervail their lack of outward grace; And how the embryo grain of nascent gold Is fire combined beneath the inmost hills. And thus you find me here, among my books, Almost the only friends I have on earth! Friends that can never weary nor intrude. My faithful books and I have never jars; They seek me not at unpropitious times; They peer not on me with insidious eyes, To prey upon my weakness, and find A sport thereof for other grinning fools. It is an idle and a prying world, That ever frets to catch its neighbour out; To probe the hidden sorrow of his soul, And worm his secrets from him. With what zest It bares his imperfections to the sun, To shame him into grovelling with itself,— A slanderous snake, polluting all things pure, Where'er it touches in its slimy track! In me my lonely and abstracted life Has wrought distaste and loathing of my kind; But days of study, nights of tireless thought, Perpetual readings of the cypher stars, Most patient watchings over jar and vial, And smouldering crucible, to disentangle The knots of intricate and natural life, Have given for this, the void of solitude, A higher converse than with fellow men, And drawn down beings of another sphere,— A loved companionship. THE SPIRITS OF AIR. FIRST SPIRIT. We spirits wander Midway between the cloud-rack and pure Heaven; We roam in intricate mæander, For no rest to us is given: But swifter than their fleeting racks The storm-winds blow us,— To make a network with our crossing tracks, Of earth below us. SECOND SPIRIT. Here and there for ever driven,— For to us there are not given Souls that we like men should grieve; Human hearts, that we should care! Sentence ours without reprieve— Past all mortals' our despair! Bondsmen are we thine, and slaves: Bid us search the long-made graves, They shall render up their corses; Speak! thy word from ocean caves, Hidden store of treasure forces. THIRD SPIRIT. The north-wind courses The feathery clouds across the face of day! The breadth of gleaming day! Our fleet unrivalled horses Mock at his slow delay. FIRST SPIRIT. Down from the zenith star, We fall; and mortals think the stars are falling; And in some well or mine-shaft buried far, We gather the star image, For a diadem we wear it: And over fen and deep morass In our forehead set we bear it. SECOND SPIRIT. We shout as we flit by the cleft mountain side, For the air hath a current, the air hath a tide, And the sound we must catch it, whatever betide, And back with it over the precipice glide. And mortals fancy 'tis the Echo's doing; But 'tis our song! The cold and unmoved rock nymph wooing, The terraced dells along. SPIRIT-CHORUS. We little care Whether fire or air Or sea-depths rare Give us habitation. For wherever we be, Under earth or in sea, We must wander Without cessation. FIRST SPIRIT. To airless caverns of the Gnomes, Where sun comes never; To deep-based rocks, where frets and foams The wild wave ever. Our phalanx clambers The Atlas' side, On to antarctic chambers, The storm we ride. SECOND SPIRIT. The isles of ocean Are wondrous fair! There braid the sea nymphs Their amber hair! There chant the mermaids Their music rare— And often there, By hundreds, and by thousands, and by millions, Before our gleaming tents and fair pavilions, Floats on the Elfin throng— To where the sun has clomb, Halfway the azure dome Of his ascension! THIRD SPIRIT. By night, when stars have set, On that high roof of jet, Their mazy pattern! Where ever of Saturn The annular brightness Knows no eclipse! And of feather-down lightness, Each spirit that trips, Revolves round the orbit A satellite poor, Of the noblest of spheres, On the star-jewelled floor. SPIRIT-CHORUS. For we little care Whether earth or air, Or sea-depths rare, Give us habitation. For wherever we be, Under earth, or in sea, We must wander without cessation. What matter! No souls have we to grieve, No hearts that we should care! From our sentence no reprieve! Endless! endless! our despair! HARPER'S SONG. How much is to be done! how few the arms! How few the lances! Fortress, fosse and tower, Gird in the wrong that spoils the peaceful bower, And robs the maiden's charms! Fair chivalry and knighthood are but specks, Beacons faint glimmering in a night-spread land! Ah! happy champion, he who forth shall stand, To bruise of wrong the hundred Hydra necks! Upon the battlements the captive maiden Looks out on distance: “Will no hero come? No sound of horn or hoof?” The woods are dumb! Are dumb—and her poor heart with care o'erladen! How many loving hearts, what great reward, Lie stored for thee, O knight of laurelled brow! Ah! who would rein or rowel slacken now, Till he return thus crowned, thus honor-scarred! But I am old, alas! I cannot go; Mine arm is feeble, and my locks are snow. Oh give me, youth, those limbs thou valuest not! Oh give me, youth, thy fire I have not got! Or else without them, old, I still will go! THE PEARL NECKLACE. “O tell me, patient fisherman, Why fishest thou so deep? Thy nets all torn, the rocks have worn, With their edges sharp and steep!” “O gentle stranger, here I sit, And still shall sit for many a day, To fish among the shining rocks, And sunken reefs, and bouldered blocks, Fathoms and fathoms far away. For once, in years now gathered long To rest among the ages past, A stately barge that sailed along, With careless hearts and bridal song, Went down before the sudden blast. And the princess Yselinda, the peerless Yselinda, By her ladies girt around, In going to her lover, to wed her royal lover, On the treacherous reef was drowned. And my father told the story, As I stood beside his knee— Of his riches and his glory (In the days that were to be, When our babies' heads were hoary), Who should dive beneath the sea, And in the cabin where she sleeps Unclasp the band of pearls, Disentangled from the curls, Her fairy neck that cluster round,— If he returned but safe and sound, No greater man would then be found, Through all the land than he. So when I came to manly age, With costly fee and golden wage, To search among the wreck, I hired a cunning diver, Skilled in depths of lake or river, (But his fate it makes me shiver), For he scarce had touched the deck; When a grisly beast of ocean, A monster dread and grim, With arms, and feelers long and white, Around him twined them in my sight, And sucked him limb by limb! So ne'er another diver could I make to go for gold, And so I here sit fishing, For the pearls all vainly wishing; And shall sit till I am old! [END OF FRAGMENTARY PIECES.] ???????? ?????? ??? ????. O life thou art a hard and strange enigma! Nothing remains from day to day the same; Greetings and partings, and a looking onwards, To something changeless, but without a name. We fondly trust the ever-fading future; Time makes that future present, but can bring No satisfaction: Time flies past and droppeth Regret a sombre feather from his wing. We make new ties; the old are rent asunder, Torn rudely from us, but their scar remains; Those I have loved are passed away for ever, But still the clay of earth my spirit stains. I would be great, and think upon those dear ones; I would be pure as they from touch of sin! My soul is travel-soiled and care-corroded, This flesh is burthensome that hems it in. Ah, look not back, poor soul! lest thou be cheerless; Blindfold thine eyes, or onwards look alone! Pray that some angel pinion guide thee, fearless, Unswerving, towards the everlasting throne! Beyond the azure of the cloudless sky, Beyond the beam of this terrestrial day! Lead on, ye saint-like forms, to rest on high, In blessed homes where joy shall ne'er decay! A LADY ASLEEP. She sleeps so light, she scarcely seems to dream; She sleeps so light, the moon with passing beam, That flitteth o'er her pallid, clear cut face, From side to side can make her change her place, And move her restless head about the pillow,— Can make her bosom heave like ocean's billow, And wave like ocean flowers her golden hair. She seems some slumbering angel passing fair, If angels ever sleep— Or even tire with happy watch they keep About the everlasting doors, whose portals Echo the myriad steps of the immortals! See! near her couch the steady flame that glows, Susceptible of some slight motion, shows A distant coming, ere a footstep fall, Through winding corridor or distant hall, Can catch the ear in that deep stillness heard: Nearer and nearer, more and more is stirred, The taper trembling now from side to side. And yet that sound, to our gross ears denied, Affects the current of the silent air, And tells of something that approaches there, Some viewless phantom on the muffled stair. At times she sleeps in grand and pure repose; Upon her brow the lily, and the rose Upon her cheek; with graceful, flowing lines, Her lustrous form as sculptured Parian shines. Like some fair image from a master hand, Triumph of art—a marvel in the land— Lovely as twilight carved by skill divine, Upon the tomb of that great Florentine. ASTARTE. Ah! could things be as I have dreamed, The fairest dream that e'er was told. As amber, love, thy tresses gleamed, The lustre from thine eyes was gold! When, in that blest deceit of sleep, I fancied thou wert wholly mine, Mine! could the waking world but keep One fraction of such bliss divine! Yet art thou fairer than my dream, Thine eyes are like when Venus' star At even sheds her radiant beam, Their rays are near, she shines afar. Had I such harmony of rhyme As never poet wove to song— Choice metaphors of ancient time Could I but strew my verse among— I should not paint her beauty's flower, Or tell the lustre of her eyes— A hopeless task, my feeble power, To every poor attempt denies. AN OLD LEGEND. Time was in younger ages of this earth, When men had fresher, more unsullied minds, To fight in virtue's conflict, that there dwelt In the far islands of the western sea, A King, who ever made his constant boast That never yet unjustly for a crime Had any subject perished, and that guilt Met always its detection in his realm. Until one day a beggar-woman came, And sat before his gates (for in that land There were no beggars, it was ruled so well), And made her plaint, and called a curse from heaven On those whom their prosperity had made Stone cold of heart; and men say it befell, That the same night the Crown-prince of the realm Was found a lifeless corse, and that the sea-board Was wasted by galleys of the Moors, Who massacred and pillaged all they found, Till there were thousands in the beggared plight Of that one beggar-woman unrelieved, And many a day a crown without an heir. THE EVE OF THE BATTLE. The king came on with all his hosts of war, His myrmidons of steel that flanked him in; The vulture scented battle from afar, And screamed above them with a hideous din. No heart was there, in all that plumèd throng, But fiercely beat, and wished the fight begun: There was no pity those stern breasts among,— Quarter or mercy for the vanquished, none! The lion-impulse in our nature planted, When roused, whole floods of bloodshed must allay. Dark glared each rider as his lance he slanted, With tiger ardour, thirsting for the fray. Each stripling thought himself a warrior tried; Each veteran fancied youth returned again; And grandly stern resounds from either side A fiery melody of martial strain. As floated o'er their ranks that music wild, Consonant clashed the battle-axe and spear, With thoughts of country, prayer for wife and child, Their last farewells the soldier seemed to hear. Until each warrior felt a rapturous thrill, His spirits kindle to great deeds of might! With steady courage and undaunted will Thus stood they waiting for that awful fight. REGRET. O man! in vain thy toil and high endeavour; Thou art imperfect, and imperfect joy Must be thy lot, with pain and sorrow ever Tinging thy fairest hours with some alloy. O man! in vain great thoughts of thine ambition, Lofty as heaven, and firm as fate's decree; Though thou mayst rise to honour, thy condition Success or failure bettereth no degree. O man! how very vain is love's young dreaming! The flower a few short hours may bloom, then fade: With locks of snow, and eyes no longer gleaming, Comes bitter retrospect of hopes decayed! Comes bitter thinking on that fairy vista, Which youth before our childish footsteps spread,— Comes back my love's pale brow, when last I kissed her, And found the light of her dear eyes was dead. I closed their quiet lids, to saddest slumber; I took one tress of all her radiant hair: I sat me down half sorrow-crazed to number The few short hours the grave had still to spare. She sleeps among the grand, eternal mountains, By alpine vale, in consecrated ground, Near sounding avalanche, and murmuring fountain, Pure as the snow of heaven her grave around! THE WEDDING. She kneels before the altar, and around her All whom she loves are in that holy place; While the emotion of that awful moment Pales as in death her fair half-childish face. In the deep silence with its broken accents Her voice must speak that promise for a life: Father and mother, sisters of her childhood, All must she leave to take the name of wife! The graceful outline of her archèd neck The muslin veil half-hides with mistlike fold; As tremblingly she lifts her glorious eyes, To read in his vast depths of love untold! He now is all in all,—the vestry gained, Her form half-fainting his true arms sustain, As through the open pane they pensive gaze On quiet churchyard, moist with summer rain. And all the while the happy wedding bells Peal forth to all the country far and wide; And well-known forms are thronging all the porch To catch one glimpse of the departing bride. O love untold, rich as the summer rain, Sweet as those bells' fair melody and chime! Two souls are knit in union mystical, Now and forever to all endless time! THE EXILE. I breathed upon her tresses,— I did not dare to wake her; I knew that my caresses From some happy dream would take her. I left a primrose near her cheek, A cowslip on her pillow; I fled away across the sea, On the restless, heaving billow! And many springs have bloomed and died, And many roses faded; My flowerets withered, frost-untried, And from the storm-wind shaded. They passed away like many things As fair,—may rest be given To them, for things so beautiful Must surely go to heaven. I think upon her beauty, And my heart is nearly broken; One half its inward bitterness That heart has never spoken: It drooped and pined without her smile, By sorrow worn and wasted, And never since that parting hour Of earthly joy has tasted. ST. CECILIA. Divine Cecilia, wrapt in prayer that tunest The pedals of the organ-sounding quire; And from thy faithful heart, sweet Saint, that prunest All earthly wishes, every mean desire. Thou showest to us hymns that seraph voices Have whispered thee unheard by mortal ears— Each soul caught up, and eased of sin, rejoices, A glorious ecstacy of happy tears! O teach us ever, Saint, thy holy praises! To us poor mortals heavenly music show! And as the angel host its anthem raises, Like melodies repeat us here below. Teach us the cadence of that high devotion, If aught our grosser souls can comprehend; Teach us of fervent prayer the true emotion, That praise and thanksgiving that knows not end. Thou passed'st here on earth a stormy season, With trials manifold and perils fraught; From heathen scorn and seeming friendship's treason, Thy consolation angel music brought. And we, enraptured with thy heavenly beauty Touched by the glory of thy sainted life, Feel holy impulses of love and duty,— Feel valiant soldiers for the Christian strife! HEZEKIAH. There is a might past man, Swifter than chariot, or the wing of eagle; That as the burning woods the whirlwinds fan, Consumes the serried ranks of armies regal! Their spears are shivered, their battalions broken, Before that irresistless thunder-token. Their babbling priests may hymn Baal, or Moloch grim by grove and cedar; The star sublime of Remphan waxes dim; Divine Astarte, ye no longer need her: Wanes that Uranian Venus; fled is Dagon, Of monster visage, breath of flaming dragon! Far other is our trust Than charioteer or curved car of battle: The steed and rider are but earth and dust,— Arms without heaven, mere empty clang and rattle— Confused and shaken—struck as dead in wonder, Before thy sword of lightning, voice of thunder! The dusky spearman fled; The archer cast his quiver down, and yielded, Nor stayed to count one night's array of dead! Limb-sound were we by heaven's fair favour shielded. Thou art the God of battles, King victorious! Thy praise unbounded, and thy name all-glorious! AN ENGLISH LANDSCAPE. 'Tis harvest-time, and yet no faded leaf Sails wafted by the breeze with reaper's song; While in and out 'twixt each well-ordered sheaf The swallows intricately skim along. I love the harvest-time,—I love the cornfields; Their quiet plenty sorrow calms and stills: At early morn I listen, while are borne peals From the fair minster spire behind the hills. I love the comfort of an English landscape More than luxuriant growths in tropic glare; I love the downs, their endless breadth and grand shape, Their gentle upland swell, their healthful air. Beyond the downs the farm beside the lime-trees, Its bustling life, its varied sounds and calls, Unchanged for years—the jealous eye of time sees Few cracks and crannies in its stubborn walls! The kine graze on in plenty near the gateway,— The ewes untethered crowd about the door,— The loaden waggon toils along sedately, The stacks are gold with unexhausted store. Let others roam the Pyrenean passes, Or court the danger of the glacier side; For me our English homestead these surpasses, In happy rest, to grander scenes denied! THE FAR EAST. The slave-wrought palaces of Eastern kings, Delicious solitude of stream and roses; A paradise where nightlong bulbuls sing, And nautch-girls dance where some fair queen reposes! Deep shrouds the cypress gloom, each terrace white, Of columned alabaster each arcade, By tapering minaret, and domes of light, Where fireflies sparkle in the myrtle shade. The moaning of the river, commerce-freighted, The duller roar of a more distant sea; The sighing of the night-breeze perfume-sated, The aspen shiver of each whispering tree. A broken ridge of dark, portentous mountains, Varied with peak or drift of rosy snow,— A broad stream nourished by those torrent fountains, Rolls on in majesty its amber flow. Here all the air o'erteems with liquid odours, Here richest verdure carpets all the sod; Luxuriant breadths, round fretted gold pagodas, A monarch's pleasaunce, save by him untrod. Save when here lingers some Sultana, fairest Of all those wonders nature's power displays; A Queen of dreams, a flower of beauty rarest, A bright ideal of our early days. THE MESSAGE. Send me but one little message, And with that I'll rest content; Send me but one word of kindness, Be it but in friendship meant. Could I know that but one passing Thought of thine had dwelt on me, Though it lingered but an instant, How this thought would treasured be. If I knew that even pity For my drear and hopeless state, Gave those eyes one tinge of sadness, Comforted, resigned I'd wait. And on this frail comfort living, Patiently would bear my lot, Till revived by thy sweet presence, Though I fear thou lovest me not. Be the message thou returnest Cold as ice, or light as air, I shall prize it still, believe me, More than tenderest love elsewhere. It shall soothe each hopeless feeling,— Balm unto this wound of mine! Still the pain that knows not healing Be my sorrow's anodyne. ????????. We roamed together in an unknown land, Somewhere beyond the sky, or underground, Full of grim forms, and shapes, and scenes of wonder. We sat together upon mountains clad With strangest verdure, and we flew o'er gulfs, Restless with tides of moving, sheeny waves, Of an unequal, undulating flow, Transparent as the folds of muslin robe. We sped through endless passages and alleys, Carved in ore-laden rocks, through diamond mines, And thou wert ever with me. All the dangers, Of sights unearthly seemed as nought; my bliss Was far too great to reck the sense of fear! And then we flitted back unto those hills, And laid us down to rest upon their slopes, And thou wert ever with me, from thy side I knew no absence, each of each was part, And every motion was in unison; And through those realms of dread no separation, No severance came, but blest were we alone, Wrapt in our happiness, a world to each, A world of ecstacy in that dark place, To be forever with thee, dreams of sleep, O how unlike to all my waking hours, For never, waking, am I love with thee! THE LACE-MAKER. The wail of the night breeze Comes fitful and low, And the great city sleeps In a mantle of snow. The gaslights burn dimmer Beneath in the way, And her first rosy glimmer Doth herald the day. Each diligent finger With tear-drops is wet, Yet scarce she dare linger For thought or regret. Her past is so sad, and Her future so drear, And yet her true heart Struggles on without fear. She sees the proud lady Whirled home from the ball, From a diamond tiara, Her raven locks fall. She marks well the form Of her exquisite face, Enthroned like a queen In the depths of her lace. She knows every inch Of the flounces she wears Cost labours of weariness, Moistened by tears. Scarce dare she the depths Of her sorrow unfold; Her days they are cheerless, Her nights they are cold. Alone in that wilderness City alone, Some angel of pity, Give heed to her groan! Some angel of comfort, A messenger send! “Will sorrow ne'er cease, and Will labour ne'er end?” MURTZUPHLUS. Go bid them spend their bolts, and let them blunt Their heavy-headed arrows on our towers, And break their rams against our firm-built walls; They scarce will move one pebble in our streets. I fear not man; I have a sterner foe,— The vague cold hunger gnawing at my heart— The mighty want consuming all my soul. I am indifferent both to joy and pain; Like children on the steps of some great temple, Play on unconscious of the bridal train— Or of the funeral. Through all this world, Is there no balsam for my wounded soul? Is there no anodyne to my despair? Foemen are not so very hard to stay, As this remorseful adder in my breast; Valour and walls can keep away our foes; But eagle-perched entrenchments of high kings, Their glittering parapets unscaleable, No pinnacle of clear sun-stretching dome, No masonwork of heaven-aspiring towers, Or sunlit bastions, flushed with ruddy gold, Firm as the triple adamant, and founded Upon the necks of the eternal hills Can keep away remorse, whose insect bite Can pierce them all—or chase away the horde Of guilt inspired, unholy meditations; That locust brood consumes each new green leaf That buddeth in youth's spring time, making waste And desert of the heart. Yet I must rouse Myself from these forebodings, I will dare The Latin to the storm, and beat him back. Ours is no rudderless and lost emprise, That may be driven, hap-hazard, heaven knows where; Our town is rather in these gusts of war Like Alexandrian Pharos in a storm, Rocking before the whirlwind yet unmoved, Deep rooted on the ledges of the sea, What time the angry Nile doth fight the waves, Leagued with old Boreas, on the Libyan coast; Or like some bulk of huge ungainly crag, Some russet-coloured sandstone on the shore, About whose feet the rising tidewaves play, Doth seem to guard the coast from all invaders, And like some aboriginal Goliath, Put forth the champion of his native shore! Men say that I have risen by troublous times, As if, forsooth, that were reproach, not praise, The highest they can give me: what reproach Is it to leap forth at a moment's call, From diverse avocation, unprepared, And grasp the helm undaunted? In this wise By yellow Tiber Cincinnatus leant Upon his ploughshare in a garb of toil; And as he brushed the sweat-drops from his brow, He found himself Dictator. Yet I sinned, Dazzled a moment by the giddy height And rapid upward course; but this one blot Can never rob me of the Hero's name— Can never keep me from their glittering ranks. That glorious Hero army in all lands, And through all ages, keeps up its succession; Its vanguard all were giants, demigods, Men of a larger and a fairer mould; Its rereward are the heroes of to-day,— Men with our passions and our imperfections, But not less heroes than those older ones! I stand upon the wall; 'tis evening time, The occident is all unflushed by sunset, The heavens most gloomy,—many ages hence Will this night's deeds be told to eager ears, Long after I have passed on to my grave, A most unhappy and a childless king. Yet better thus—than were my son a fool, To sway my sceptre with a slacker hand, And let the iron rule of royal power Sway like a reed upon a sedge-grown shore! Years hence, this evening will be well remembered; Years hence, in long uncomprehended space. The tiny mosses on the dial, increased And nurtured by the sunshine of the hours, Are, Time, thy blossoms! and our bones are strewn, Trophies along the highway of thy march! Why do I linger? Bid the foeman come! Sound high the trumpets! let the flute and drum Beat an alarum in each soldier's heart. I hear their marching, and the muffled tread Of countless thousands in the lurid light; Fresh phalanxes come on, so pale with travel, The phantasms of armies much resembling! Where is the sun?—we want his strengthening face. A poor parhelion and a mimic god Is yonder pallid disk; yet still, my children, We must do great things e'er he wake again, Or we shall never more with living eyes Behold him rising from these city walls! THE CALL TO WAR. It was a temple rising o'er the sea-waves, A promontory bold their rippling foam laves; Tall fluted columns garlanded with roses: Grave priests, in vestments white, Surround the mystic light,— Within his inner fane the god reposes. The old Ionian gods in alabaster, Friezes of flowers enwrought with each pilaster; And all around the graceful peristyle, Chorus of boy and maiden, Wreath-crowned and incense-laden, With dances Time's decrepid tread beguile. Comes forth a priestess fair, Floats her dishevelled hair, With pallid cheek and terror-vacant eyes! He has unveiled his face, Bright with celestial grace,— He calls—he bids our slumbering manhood rise! Upon the mountain side, Fresh landed from the tide, Gleam the barbarian tents and gay pavilions. Holds not the land one spear? Cramps all the land one fear? Can we not raise one hundred to their millions? Let myrtle wreaths give place For steel, your limbs to case. Change for a sword your slender wands of omen. Cast silken peace away Till some more happy day. Be men!—be warriors!—and no longer women! THE EAGLE RING. There came an eagle soaring towards the sea, Above the palace of an ancient king; He spied a princess fair as fair could be, And from his talons cast a diamond ring. The princess stooped, and found the costly prize, That on her finger day by day she wore; And it reflected back her glorious eyes, And made their brilliants sparkle tenfold more. Till when the time came round that she must wed, And she of summers twice had numbered eight; Proud kings, and princes of high sovereigns bred, Came knight-attended to her palace gate. A youth behind was riding all alone, Upon a charger white, in mean attire; Across his brow the clustered ringlets shone,— Beneath them flashed an eagle glance of fire. The princess passed through all that grand array, Nor heeded king, or him of monarch born; She saw the humble knight that stood away,— She flushed as rosy as an April morn. As towards that unknown youth she turned aside, Through April tears her eyes of lustre shine: “Sir Knight, if thou wilt have me for thy bride, Poor as thou art, thy fate is surely mine.” Spake forth the king in wrath unto his child:— “Bid this thy chosen one disclose his name. A girlish phantasy, by love beguiled, Will bring our ancient lineage down to shame.” “A fairy prince,—no low-born wanderer I; Bright are my islands of the western sea: Of gorgeous visions, and unclouded sky, Thy home, my love, if thou wilt come with me! “I wed thee with this ring of jewels rare, And thou like this another ring canst show; For we have been betrothed since thou didst wear That other ring I sent thee long ago.” MAHOMET THE CONQUEROR. Where the Bosphorus goes sweeping By the golden spires and wall, Sleepless watch the Christian keeping, Dreads his mighty city's fall. Shall I make this glorious capture? Fondest project of my life! Prophet, grant that dream of rapture, Nerve me for the coming strife. Mighty triumphs, proud ovations, If I make thy honour mine! Spoil thee, head of Christian nations, End the Roman Cæsars' line. Mine shall be eternal glory, Mahomet the conqueror named, When our children tell the story How the infidel was shamed. My Osmanlis pray for conflict,— Pant like tigers for the fray; Be thy name our watchword, prophet, Doubt not we must win the day. And if I should fall in battle,— For I know the Christian brave,— Be my children but victorious, Mine were no ill-omened grave,— Welcome! if I first of Sultans Here in Europe find my rest, When the crescent waves in triumph On that great town of the West. Then, my comrades, press resistless Where Osmanlis never trod. Eager in the thirst of conquest, As was Caled, “sword of God.” Fiery as when first Arabia Poured her sons, unknowing fear; And one empire lay from Indus To the columns of Tangier. I have valiant sons to leave you, If I perish, in my stead,— Choose of them another Sultan: He shall match his father dead! Thou shalt give me fairest Houris In thine heaven of endless day; Shall I linger when mine hour is, Prophet, come to pass away? Maids of more than earthly beauty Wait thee in celestial bowers, Warrior killed in war and duty, 'Mid the amaranthine flowers. O then onwards to the storming, Conquerors crowned, or blissful dead; Let my strong battalions forming, Shake the earth with iron tread— Till the crescent banner planted, Waves on every spire and tower; And their eagles wane, supplanted, By the stern Osmanlis' power. ALL-HALLOW-E'EN. Hold to-night our high ovation, Shadowy form and image vague! Pioneers of desolation,— Flies that scent the coming plague. From the charnel vault and graveyard Trooping on. Time is short, and we must slave hard, Hence begone! Some poor mortal soul is dying! Harken to the passing bell! Earth and heaven and friends are flying From her in its awful swell. Visionary spirit regions In her track. Angel strife with hell's pale legions Tear her back. Deeply moans the storm-wind saddened; Mystic lights and flashes pass; Elfin routs, all magic maddened, Dance in mazes o'er the grass. And in mystic evolution, Frenzy driven; Whirl together in confusion Earth and heaven. Roars the distant ocean, timing Hoarser voices to the sound, Phantom notes of music chiming,— Spirit realms to-night unbound Dance,—the seething storm that clatters Doth obey us! Dance,—till morn our revel scatters, Who shall stay us? THE WRECK OF A LIFE. There lies the ocean—yonder, cliffs that bound it— The sun reflects a red disk in its waves, As if an angel in her flight that found it,— Had stored some jewel deep in watery caves. The grass with russet leaves is newly sprinkled,— The autumn woods, half sere, are changing fast. Summer, grown old, with palsied steps, and wrinkled, Fears hard encroaching winter long may last. I stand upon the downs, grey wolds behind me, Before me heaves the great eternal sea: The wintry sunset's latest beams will find me Watching the night-mists deepening past the lea. The storm behind yon worn-out windmill drifted, Saddens the landscape; and I sadly muse How man by grace divine so rarely gifted, The base and hurtful always fain would choose. My home is yonder, but 'tis drear and mouldered,— A court for bats, a palace of the dead; And ghostlike memories throng the ruined chambers, Weird forms of sorrow with most noiseless tread. I had a love, but she is false and wedded,— Her golden hair can little vex me now. Not hers that spectre form, the trebly dreaded, That comes like fury with remorseful brow. It is the ghost of wrecked ambition's day-dream, Of broken hope and disappointed pride; In sunlight pure, as 'neath the sullen moonbeam, A hateful presence ever near my side. At times, by healthful action foiled, it leaves me,— The serpent fiend awhile is charmed to rest; But time alone can heal the sting that grieves me, Can find an opiate for my aching breast. SOUTHWARDS! The glens are hoary with a winter's snows: No rivulets waft music to the meres; The sombre mountains wear upon their brows The majesty of grey, time-honoured years. The vocal birds are silent on the hill; The voice of insects, nature's myriad lays Winter has hushed; like great enchanters still The wizard chorus of less potent fays. Dear one! our footsteps warmer climes invite,— Breadths of Elysian verdure crown our way; 'Neath happy spheres of cloudless heaven, by night With brighter stars, intenser blue by day. A land enriched by jewels of the past,— Those spoils of ages, temple shaft and tower, That rose when art was great—too great to last,— When men could fathom nature's inward power! There will we rest us by the quiet sea,— There fear no more the winter north-wind drear; The air shall waft us perfume, and the bee Shall murmur, Oh, ye wanderers! peace is here! THE END.</field>
