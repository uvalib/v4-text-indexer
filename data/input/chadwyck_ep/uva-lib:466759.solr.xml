      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MOST NOBLE Algernon DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND K.G. ETC. ETC. ETC. THIS COLLECTION OF The Poetical Works of Robert Story IS (WITH HIS GRACE'S EXPRESS PERMISSION) DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR. The Heath is Green. 1816. The heath is green on Roseden Edge, Roseden Edge, the scene of this singular love-meeting, is an eminence between Roddam and Ilderton, the southern slopes of which abut upon Roddam-dean. The young ladyânow no longer young! âis still living, but her name must be sacred. The sweet-brier rose begins to bloom; While mingle, on its southern ledge, The milk-white thorn, and yellow broom. But heavy snow concealed the heath, And loaded every bloomless bough, Whenâlove's sincerest vows to breatheâ I met my Fair on yonder brow. Our troth had passed at noon to meet, And there at noon we kindly met; Our hearts were true, our words were sweet, At eve we parted with regret! I have been blest in rosy bower, I have been blest on daisied lea; But daisied lea, nor rosy bower E'er matched that snowy bank to me! O, love it cheers the hardest lot, O, love it soothes the keenest woe, It makes a palace of a cot,â It warms the chill of winter's snow! With Me, my Love, Repair. 1817. With me, my love, repair While the Morn gives us leisure, And the Spirit of Air Is abroad on his pleasure. He has left the blue sky, Where each white cloud is sleeping, Through the gay scenes to fly Which the clear dews are steeping. He roves through the heaths And the thyme of the mountain; He playfully breathes On the blue-curling fountain. The field, where the bee O'er the mead-flower is humming, And the gold-blooming lea, Roll in waves at his coming. Through the hawthorn he goes, With its snow-load of blossom; And his kiss finds the rose With the dew on her bosom!â But with me! and he will come From the best and the rarest, To sport with the bloom On the cheek of my fairest! O Thou art Fair. 1818. [Written on Mary R?, a stately and blooming girlâat that time maid to the lady of the late Lieut. General Orde, at Roddam Hall.] O thou art fair, and I am true, I feel my heart is thine, Mary; But though thou'rt fair, and I am true, Thou never canst be mine, Mary! My soul, though made for rapture high, Hath sunk in passion's storm, Mary; And it were sin in such as I To clasp an Angel's form, Mary! And all my views are wrapped in gloom, No sunbeam shines on me, Mary; Thy smile would give them light and bloomâ But that were woe to thee, Mary! No! let me sufferâ'tis my fateâ Unwept by mortal eye, Mary; But O! be thine the happiest state, Beneath the calmest sky, Mary! Then on the cloud that dims my day, One thought to cheer my breast, Mary, Shall softly shed its rainbow-rayâ The thought that thou art blest, Mary! O! Stay with Me. 1819. On the same. O stay with me, stay with me! leave me not cheerless, My sunbeam in sorrow, and soul of my glee! My face may be calm, and my eye may be tearless, But, Mary, this heartâit is bursting for thee! Though Fortune, behind a dark cloud dimly beaming, But casts a faint glance, like the Moon's on the lea, Yet stay with me, stay with me, fairest of women! The cloud may disperse to my Mary and me. O! what were the wealth of the Indies, my Mary? Without love, its splendour would lessen and flee; But the heart is a treasure whose worth cannot vary, Though the home that it offers, the poorest may be. Then stay with me, stay with me, fairest of women! My home has that treasure, and all is for thee; And though from a cloud Fortune dimly is beaming, True love will make sunshine to Mary and me! Bright was the Eye. 1819. On the same. Bright was the eye that beamed on me, My bosom coldly thrilling; Like moonshine on a winter sea, 'Twas beautiful, but chilling! And never did so sweet a tongue So harsh a sentence carry; My hopes are crushed, my heart is wrung, By Roddam's lovely Mary! In vain I prized her charms beyond Proud Valour's richest capture; In vain my fancy, young and fond, Had dreams of nought but rapture; In vain, in truth of heart, I swore Its pulse no more should vary; My truth is scorned, my heart is sore For Roddam's lovely Mary! Ye mountains, rich with purple heath, That heard my earliest numbers; Ye briery glens, that fragrance breathe, Whose music seldom slumbers; Less torn my bosom now will be To leave your charms so fairy, Since feelingless and cold to me Is Roddam's lovely Mary! I Love Her! 1819. On the same. Talk on! each fault in Mary blame That hate can think, or envy frame; Lessen her beauty, taint her fame; Whate'er you say, I love her! I look but on her cheek and eyeâ They give your base remarks the lie; How pure the glance! how fine the dye! By all that's fair, I love her! Arouse my pride: she spurns my prayer For oneâperchance less worth her care: Her presence melts that pride to air, I see herâand I love her! Describe her weak and unrefined: She comesâher tones the soul can bind! Her eye is eloquence and mind! By all that's grand, I love her! Depress me with the thought that she Must ne'er my heaven of rapture be: Blest be her heart, I say, and free! Repulsed and scorned, I love her! And while her formâa sunbeam brightâ To Memory's eye shall lend its light, By levelled Hope's eternal blight! By all my woes! I'll love her! Hushed the World. 1819. On the same. Hushed the world in slumber stilly, Rime is glistening on the lea, Midnight's moon is lighting, chilly, Roddam's every tower and tree. By each cherished hope desertedâ Hopelessâstill I think on thee; Round thy dwelling, broken-hearted, Wanderâfor 'tis sweet to me! Angels! by her pillow hovering, Singâto Mary sing of me! Say the wintry sky's my covering, Say my bed's the wintry lea! Say, though breezes, coldly swelling, Craze the naked, frozen tree, Stillâto wander round her dwelling Sweeter is than sleep to me! Winter is Gone. 1819. On the same. Grim in his sullen cloud Winter hath flown; Smiling in triumph proud Spring hastens on; Hark! in her laughing train Comes the cuckoo again, Sounding the victor strainâ âWinter is gone!â Sprinkled along the lea, Young flowers are blown; Green leaves bedeck the tree, Newly put on; Primrose and daisy rath Bloom by each shady path, Birds sing in every strathâ âWinter is gone!â But by the greenwood bough Wandering alone, Mary, I miss thee nowâ Miss thee, and moan! O! what are now to me Bird, flower, and blooming tree? Ne'er can they tell, like thee, âWinter is gone!â O! Calm, my Love. 1819. O calm, my love, the tumult here, Where peace and joy should only be; And, Anna, wipe away the tear, For, trust me, I am true to thee! Yon stars that seemed to pause on high To see two hearts so blest below, In blazing wreck shall leave the sky When thou art left to lonely woe! Thy bosom-chords are finely drawnâ And cruel were the hand could bear, Profane, to wake another tone Than one of joy or rapture there! When Summer comes with all her blooms, Thy love shall be my sweetest flower; When Winter flings his cheerless glooms, Thy smile shall light my humble bower. Thou Fairest Maid. 1820. [On Miss H?, a beautiful young lady in Neweastleâlong since dead.] Thou fairest maid that blooms by Tyne, Thou fairest maid that blooms by Tyne, A thousand smiles I can forgetâ But ne'er forget one glance of thine! How blest the man whose worth shall gain Thy young bright eye's approving shineâ Immortal Love shall form his chain, And Rapture link his hand to thine! Thou fairest maid, &amp;c. My cup was hallowed by thy touch; Proud of thy dark glance, foamed the wine; And O! its taste to me was suchâ 'Twas inspiration all divine! Thou fairest maid, &amp;c. Could all my countless sufferings past Return, and in one blast combine, How gladly would I bear that blast To press thy hand, and call thee mine! Thou fairest maid, &amp;c. O! to Rest beside Thee. 1820. [In memory of Anna Boer, a fine young woman from Shropshire, who died unmarried. My love for her was the purest I had ever known.] O to rest beside thee, Anna! O! to rest beside thee, Anna! Calm beneath the grass and flowers From love's pure eye that hide thee, Anna! No more thy light heart leaps to glee, Love's sacred thrillings leave it, Anna; But all the ills that menace meâ O, none of these can grieve it, Anna! O to rest beside thee, &amp;c. In vain to thee the summer blooms, And azure skies bend o'er thee, Anna; But adverse fortune's deepening glooms Are never hung before thee, Anna! O to rest beside thee, &amp;c. My song would thus embalm thy name, And thouâthou canst not hear it, Anna; But gathering hisses blast my fame, And I survive to bear it, Anna! O! to rest beside thee, &amp;c. On Skipton's Vales. 1820. [Skipton is the capital of the beautiful district of Craven.] On Skipton's vales and mountains play The first red gleams of Morning gayâ O linger yet! ye moments, stay! Nor urge my flight from blue-eyed Jessy! Ye sweetly-opening daisies, filled With tears from moonlight mists distilled, The sun will dry your bosoms chilled, And ye will smile like blue-eyed Jessy! No sun, or spring-breeze passing by, Shall wake my bloom, my tears shall dry; A desert plant, I'll withered lie Unwept, and far from blue-eyed Jessy! Alas! the moments will not stayâ The sky-lark summons me away! But while my heart's warm pulses play, My heart shall throb for blue-eyed Jessy! To the Northern Breeze. 1820. Northern Breeze! that lov'st to hover In this vale of constant green, Tell me, hast thou sported over Roddam's every dearer scene? Hast thou swept the Cheviot mountains, Rich with all their rath perfume? Curled the pure and sprightly fountains, Gushing through their bordering bloom? Hast thou sighed where forest shadows O'er the path of lovers fell, When the hour of gloaming led usâ Loversâto the silent dell? âFondest of illusive fancies! Yet what truth like it can please? Impotent were necromancy's, To thy spell, sweet Northern Breeze! My Love is not yon Wild Rose. 1820. [The lady who inspired this, my first Gargrave song, afterwards Mrs. M?, has been dead many years. The infant Aire flows through the village once perfumed by her sweetness.] My love is not yon wild rose That decks the river's bank so greenâ My love is not yon wild rose, Whose sweetest charms at once are seen. Her emblem true uncloses Its leaves in yonder garden fairâ Worth all the wilding roses That e'er a summer strewed by Aire! The garden rose-bud, pearly With drops imbibed before the sun Expands to morning early Its folded beauties, one by one; Each new recess revealing A hue more sweet, a tint more fairâ And such is she whom Feeling And Taste proclaim the Rose of Aire. The rose-leaf folded over Its gem of gathered dew refined, Is not a sweeter cover Than Myra's form is to her mind! No dew-gem half so bright is, By sunbeam found reposing there, As Myra's soul of light isâ My love's the Gem and Rose of Air O! Love has a favourite Scene. 1820. O love has a favourite scene for roamingâ It is in the dell where the Aire is foaming; And love has an hour, of all the dearestâ It is when the star of the west is clearest; It is when the moon on the wave is yellow; It is when the wood's last song is mellow; It is when the breeze, o'er the scene reposing, Stirs not a flower as its leaves are closing; And every green bough of the brier thou meetest, Has rose-buds and roses the softest and sweetest! Come, love! 'tis the scene and the hour for roaming, The dell is green, and the Aire is foaming. Not purer the light that the west is pouring, Not purer the gold that the moon is showering, Not purer the dew on the rose's blossom,â Than the love, my dear maid, that warms my bosom! Yet morn will come, when the dewâascendingâ Will leave the dry flower on its stalk depending, The star the blue west, and the moon the river, Will quitâbut my heart shall be thine for ever! The Star of Eve. 1820. [On Miss H?, of Gargrave, long since dead. The Song, in structure, resembles Burns's inimitable lyric, âO Bonnie was the Rosy Brier.â] The star of eve was beaming bright, The rose-tree decked the greenwood's gloom; But Myra's eye was purer light, And Myra's cheek was fairer bloom. The dew upon the closing flowers Its tender, sparkling moisture shed; But tenderer looks and words were ours, For love was all we thought and said. The crimson clouds along the sky Retained the light that lately shone; And O! that hour's reflection high Shall gild my heart till life is gone! Fairer than the Fairest Blossom. 1821. On the same. Fairer than the fairest blossom Opening on the sunny lea! Torture not a constant bosom, Female arts are lost on me. Shall my love be unrequited? Let the sentence then be heard; And may I be further slighted If I beg a second word! Would thy heart its own retain me? Angel charms are thine, my dear; These enchant meâthese enchain meâ Coyness is but wasted here. Cloud and gleam, by turns that fly, love, Mark a Craven's summer dayâ Be not thou a changeful sky, love; Let thy beams for ever play! Flowers that in the shade would perish, In the light will blossom high; And my love will only flourish In the sunshine of thine eye! The Flower of Malhamdale. 1821. [This lady was a Miss Dewhurst, who died at Airton in Malhamdale in, I think, her 16th year.] If on some bright and breezeless eve, When falls the ripe rose leaf by leaf, The moralising bard will heave A sigh that seems allied to grief,â Shall I be blithe, shall I be mute, Nor shed the tear, nor pour the wail, When death has blighted to its root The sweetest Flower of Malhamdale? Her form was like the fair sun-stream That glances through the mists of noonâ Ah! little thought we that its beam Would vanish from our glens so soon! Yet when her eye had most of mirth, And when her cheek the least was pale, They talked of purer worlds than earthâ She could not stay in Malhamdale! The placid depth of that dark eye, The wild-rose tint of that fair cheekâ Will still awake the long-drawn sigh, While Memory of the past shall speak. And we can never be but pained To think, when gazing on that vale, One Angel more to Heaven is gained, But one is lost to Malhamdale! I may not tell what dreams were mineâ Dreams laid in bright futurityâ When the full, soft, and partial shine Of that fair eye was turned on me. Enough, enoughâthe blooming wreath Of Love, and Hope, and Joy, is pale, And now its withering perfumes breathe O'er yon new grave in Malhamdale! O these are not mine own Hills. 1821. [On arriving in Craven, whither I had come on foot, and seeing the hillsâso like, and yet so unlike the Northumbrian mountainsâI became seized with a home-sickness the most intense. I fancied myself banished to a far-distant land; and if the reader, who may be inclined to smile at the idea, will reflect that railways then were not; that stage coaches were above my means; and that my estimate of distance was founded on my power as a pedestrian; he will see that the idea was not so very absurd.] O these are not mine own hills, Fair though their verdure be; Distant far mine own hills, That used to look so kind on me! These may have their rock and cairn, Their blooming heath, and waving fernâ But O! they stand so strange and stern, And never seem like friends to me âWhere, prythee, rise thine own hills? In France or brighter Italy? What fruit is on thine own hills, That we must deem so fair to see? Grows, in Summer's constant shine, The orange there, or purpling vine? Does myrtle with the rose entwine On mountains so beloved by thee?â All bleak along mine own hills The heather waves, the bracken free; The fruit upon mine own hills Is scarlet hip and blaeberry. And yet I would not them exchange, 'Mid gay Italian scenes to range; No! vine-clad hills would look as strange, As stern, and lone, as these to me! In boyhood, on mine own hills, I plucked the flower, and chased the bee In youth, upon mine own hills, I wooed my loves by rock and tree: 'Tis hence my loveâto tearsâthey claim; And, let who will the weakness blame, But when, in sleep, I dream of themâ I would not wake aught else to see! Pours the Spring. 1821. [Howdsdenâwhich I have softened into Howsdenâa beautiful hill overlooking the Beaumont. It is remarkable as being always the very first to acknowledge, by its verdure, the favours of returning Spring. Its base, when I kept sheep upon it in my boyish days, used to exhibit a perfect forest of broom.] Pours the Spring its earliest green Upon Howsden still? Are the milk-white hawthorns seen Upon Howsden still? Does the tall and grove-like broom, With its moist and yellow bloom, Shed a glory and perfume Upon Howsden still? Rests the white and downy cloud Upon Howsden still; Is the skylark's carol loud Upon Howsden still? Is the curlew seldom dumb? And the wild beesâdo they come, As of old, to sip and hum Upon Howsden still? Sits the happy shepherd boy Upon Howsden still, Singing blithe his song of joy Upon Howsden still? While far beneath his eyes The blue stream of Beaumont lies, And her liquid murmurs rise Upon Howsden still? Ah! the Summer sheds delight Upon Howsden still; And I walk, in dreams by night, Upon Howsden still; When, waking 'mid my joy, I but meet the world's annoy, And wish I were a boy Upon Howsden still! How Sleep the Dead. 1821. How sleep the dead in yon church yard, Where chequering moonbeams purely fall? How sleep the dead beneath the sward? Calmlyâsoftlyâsweetly all! In mute companionship they lieâ No hearts that ache, no eyes that weep! Pain, sickness, trouble, come not nigh The beds of those that yonder sleep. Around, the world is passion-tostâ War, murder, crime, for ever reign; Of sacred peace alone may boast The church yard's undisturbed domain. The stormy sea of human life, With all its surges, roars around; Their barrier-wall repels its strifeâ No wave breaks o'er their hallowed ground! Around, the summer sun may scorchâ The dead feel not the sultry ray; Winter may howl in spire and porchâ The dead are reckless of his sway. Thus sleep the dead in yon church yard, Where chequering moonbeams purely fall; Thus sleep the dead beneath the swardâ Calmlyâsoftlyâsweetly all! I shall never See it More. 1821 I shall never see it more! save in visions during sleep, Whenâbut half-deceivedâI gaze on it, and as I gaze I weep; But 'tis blossomed bright in Memory yet, and shades the verdant steep, The sweetest hawthorn tree on the banks of the Till! 'Twas a lovely eve in Spring, and the crimson of the west Lay like a dream of heaven on the river's gentle breast, When we met beside the hawthorn tree, in milk-white blossoms dressed, The loving and the loved, on the banks of the Till! I have wanderedâwandered long in the heartless ways of men, And have often felt the thrill of loveâbut never more as then, When we lay in young love's happy trance amid the silent glenâ Beside the hawthorn tree on the banks of the Till! My Mary was as pure as the bloom upon the tree! She diedâand left my heart exposed to vice and misery; She drank of life's first rapture-cup, and what is left to me, But a worthless draught, afar from the banks of the Till! The Young Poet Dying at a Distance from Home. 1822 [Written during a slight attack of illness. I imagined I was going to dieâfar from Roddam-dean, where, in my feverish excitement, I wished to be buried.] O bury me not in yon strange spot of earth! My rest never sweet, never tranquil can be; But bear me away to the land of my birth, To a sceneâO how dear, and how pleasant to me! If you saw how the sunbeams illumine the mountains, How brightly they lie in the glen that I chooseâ Could the song of its birds, and the gush of its fountains, Through your souls the rapture and freshness diffuse, Which in life's happy morning they shed over mineâ O! your hearts would confess it is all but divine! Nay, call it not raving! A stranger I came, And a stranger amongst you I ever have been: When I stepped from my circle, you found me the same Vain trifler as thousands beside in the scene. But I lived in a circle of fancy and feeling, A world of fair forms, a creation of bliss, Though never to you the dear secret revealing: My first and my latest disclosure is this, This dying requestâthe last night of the dream!â O! do not despise it, though wild it may seem. I know itâthe grave which to me you assign, Is black in the shade of your dreary church-wall, Where nettle and hemlock their rankness combine, And the worm and sullen toad loathsomely crawl. O! where is the primrose, so meet for adorning The grave of a Minstrel cut off in his bloom? O! where is the daisy, to shed in the morning The tears it had gathered by night, for my doom? And dearerâO! dearer than anguish can tell, Where, where are the friends that have loved me so well? Thrice blest be those tears! they descend on my heart Like the soft rain of Spring on a perishing flowerâ And may I expire in the hope they impart, ThatâyetâI shall rest by my favourite bower? Heaven love you for that! Like the flower I have shown you, No more to expand in the loveliest ray, And breathing its last sigh of perfume upon you, My spirit, all grateful, shall vanish away! For laid in the glen, by the stream and the tree, Deep, hallowed, and happy, my slumber shall be! See! one aged Mourner comes, trembling, to place A weak, withered hand on the grave of her sonâ See! Frendship, to tell how I strove in the race, But died ere the chaplet of glory was wonâ And BeautyâI plaited a wreath for that Maiden When warm was my heart, and my fancy was highâ See! Beauty approaches with summer-flowers laden, And strews them when nought but the blackbird is nigh! Thus, thus shall I rest, with a charm on my name, In the shower-mingled sunshine of Love and of Fame! An Eye in its dark-glancing Beauty. [On Miss H?, already alluded to. See ante.] An eye in its dark-glancing beauty hath spoken, A lip hath been pressed like a rose-bud in dew, And the clasp of a soft hand has thrilled as a token Through fibre and veinâthat my Fanny is true! There's a tint of romance in the sunbeam that lightens By turns the green vale, and the mountain's wild hue; It comes from the thought that internally brightens, The heart-blessing thoughtâthat my Fanny is true! There's a voice in the gale, as it sighingly wanders Where the young buds of Spring open green on the view; There's a voice in the stream, as it purely meanders, Breathing fresh o'er the soulâthat my Fanny is true! The lark, as he soars from the strained eye of wonder, Or brushes the white cloud that streaks the fine blue, Sends down his loud note to the choristers under, And wood and vale ring withâmy Fanny is true! O soften, my song! for a transport is given, To which the best chords of the bosom are due; And sink like the gale on a rose-bank at even, In a long sigh of blissâthat my Fanny is true! The Splendours of Sunset. 1822. [On the marriage of my late and old friend, Mr. Tatham, of Gargrave Both he and his Isabel have long gone the way of all flesh.] The splendours of the sunset diffuse their last tinges Athwart the fine azure, and streak it afar; While, peeping serene through their faint-meeting fringes, Appears in its beauty the love-hallowed star. And see, o'er the summit of Flasby dividing, The clouds in their bosom the fair Moon receive, Who, like some pure spirit in majesty gliding, Comes forth to smile joy on our blithe bridal eve! âThe love I have whispered when such an hour yellowed The scene of our meeting by stream or by grove, Which reason hath sanctioned, and intercourse mellowed, To-morrow will show it was genuine love. I chose from a world, first allured by thy beauty, The charms of thy mind have confirmed me thine own; And the vow I pronounce, will but hallow to duty, What my heart must have taught meâto love thee alone. âBut say, canst thou love me alone, and for ever? Ah, tell me! for loved and adored as thou art, If one were as dear to thee, yet we might sever! I would not divide with a Monarch thy heart!â So spoke a fond Youth, while his Isabel listened, Nor uttered a word to his doubt or his fear; But her soft cheek it glowed, and her blue eye it glistened, And she hid in his bosom her blush and her tear! Look round on this World. 1822. Look round on this worldâit is sweet, it is fair; There is light in its sky, there is life in its air; Sublimity breathes from the forms of its hills, And beauty winds on with its rivers and rills; The dew, as with diamonds, its meads hath besprent; From its groves are a thousand wild melodies sent; While flowers of each tint are by Morning impearled: O! why is there woe in so lovely a world? Say not that the picture is drawn in a time When Summer is Queen of the sky and the climeâ Remember young Spring, with her rainbows and songs; The charm that to Autumn's bright foliage belongs; And Winter's stern pomp, which no chilled feeling mars In his snow-shining land, and his concave of stars! Each change is a joy, or of joy is the heraldâ O! why is there woe in so lovely a world? Talk not of a Spectre, whose skeleton hand Robs the sun of his glory, and darkens the landâ His touch with a power that no talisman knows, But wraps the worn soul in a moment's repose, To wake in a region yet fairer than this, Where the heart never beats but its throb is of bliss! His flag is but Rapture's bright banner unfurledâ O! why is there woe in so lovely a world? It is not in Winter, with cloud and with stormâ There are passions yet wilder that stain and deform! It is not in Death, with his fear-imaged dartsâ There are vices yet deadlier, throned in her hearts! These mar the Eternal's beneficent plan, Who furnished this earth as the Eden of man, By these, through our souls hath disorder been hurledâ O! these have brought woe to so lovely a world! I sought the Halls. 1822. [The halls meant were those of Eshton, where Ellen Ellisonânow Mrs. Storyâhad resided. Set to music by GÃ¶dby.] I sought the halls, sweet Ellen, Where thou wast wont to be; And I deemed, my dearest Ellen, They still were bright with thee. As sun-hues linger on the hill Long after evening falls, So seemed the light of beauty still To gild the lonely halls! I sought the garden, Ellen, I sought the arbour fair; And I vow, my dearest Ellen, Thy sweetness met me there. The brightest Rose had left the bower, But still her favourite scene Retained the fragrance of the flower, And told where she had been! Exposed in Life's. 1822. On the same. Exposed in life's neglected vale, To scorch in sun, or waste in gale, The wild-rose tints so softly pale That first attracted me, loveâ O unbefriended! take my aid, Accept my shelter and my shade, Where suns shall but in gleams pervade, And storms blow calm to thee, love! The summer leaves of Fortune now Have clothed my every spreading bough; One ornament I want, and thouâ O thou art that to me, love! Then comeâand, by my hopes refined! No Oak that ever braved the wind, So screened the Woodbine round him twined, As I will shelter thee, love! I have heard of Fair Climes. 1822 [The home-sickness begins to disappear.] I have heard of fair climes lying nearer the sun. Where the summer and autumn are blent into one, Where the flowers in unfailing succession come forth, And brighter of hue than the flowers of the north, Where the fruit and the blossom adorn the same treeâ Yet Craven, green Craven, 's the land for me. I have heard of the azure enchanting all eyes, The deep, cloudless blue of Italian skiesâ But give me the wild heaven, now gloomy, now gay, That with shadow and sunshine stills varies the day, Forming scenes which a painter or bard loves to seeâ And Craven, green Craven, 's the land for me! Can lands where the summer and autumn entwine, Exhibit a contrast more pleasing than thine? Springs smiles in yon vale where the river is rolled, And Autumn has hung yonder mountain with gold; Yon beech tree stands red on an emerald leaâ O, Craven, green Craven, 's the land for me! Why talk of Circassia as Beauty's domain? Or why of the dark-glancing daughters of Spain? We have maids that might realise dreams of above, Too lovelyâif aught were too lovelyâfor love, As sweet as their Spring, as their mountain-winds freeâ Yes! Craven, green Craven, 's the land for me! In May's Expansive Ether. 1823. [On Ellen Ellison.] In May's expansive ether Floats many a downy cloudâ Some white and pure as silver, Some edged and streaked wi' gowd. I care na for the gorgeous sight, Though fair as sight may be; My bonnie Craven lassie Is the dearest sight to me! All yellow as the cloudlet, My love's bright locks are laid, And radiant as its silver The neck and brow they shade. The heart that beats within her breast Is now na langer freeâ My bonnie Craven lassie Has bestowed her heart on me The bloom is on the hawthorn, The green leaf's on the tree, The king-cup gems the meadow, And the gowan stars the lea. I care na for the charms o' spring, Though fair those charms may beâ My bonnie Craven lassie Is the dearest charm to me! On yonder bank a blossom Is mirrored in the lakeâ The next wild breeze that sweeps it The shadowy charm will break. But what wild breeze shall e'er efface The impress here of thee? My bonnie Craven lassie, Thou art wealth and fame to me! In my Hey-day of Youth. 1823. In my hey-day of youth, when each pulse beat to glee, I roved amang lasses o' ilka degree, The gentle, the semple, the cauld, and the kind, The neat country girl, and the lady refined; But when I looked out a companion for life, I found nane to suit like my ain little Wife! She was heir to na wealth, but to balance it a', Her tastes were na nice, and her wishes were la'; Her forbears were poor, but to tell it I'm fain, She need na to blush for their deeds nor her ain; The tap o' the cassay they trod on thro' life, And left their fair fame to my ain little Wife; By the ingle at e'en, when my labour is o'er, I draw my chair ben on a nice sanded floor, Then I tell her a tale, or she sings me a sang, And the lang winter nights are to us never lang; While to keep a' things tidy's the pride o' her life, And I ca' her in rapture my ain little Wife! If there's gloom in her e'eâas a vapour will rise And darken the bluest o' Simmer's blue skiesâ It stays na sae lang till it quite disappears, Laughed aff by a love-blink, or melted in tears, In tears that bring feelings the sweetest in life, As I clasp to my bosom my am little Wife! The Rayless Night. 1823. The rayless night hath richer sweets To me than day with all its beams, For dear is She my spirit meets And talks with, in the land of dreams. My love's eye, darkly fringed and brightâ Her raven hair's luxuriant playâ Her rose-bud lips, that breathe delightâ On these I dare not look by day. But all are mine in slumber's bliss! Her fair eye's glance is fond and free; Her lips receive my ardent kiss, And vow eternal truth to me. Through fairy climes and fairy skies, Through scenes that sunbeam never saw, Clasped to my soul, with me she fliesâ The world forgotten, and its law! Another Year. 1824. Another year, another year, O! who shall see another year? âShalt thou, old man of hoary head, Of eye-sight dim, and feeble tread? Expect it not! Time, pain, and grief Have made thee like an autumn-leaf, Ready, by blast or self-decay, From its slight hold to drop awayâ And some sad Morn may gild thy bier Long, long before another year! Another year, another year, O! who shall see another year? âShall you, ye young? or you, ye fair? Ah! the presumptuous thought forbear! Within this church yard's peaceful boundsâ Come, pause and ponder o'er the mounds! Here Beauty sleepsâthat verdant length Of grave contains what once was Strengthâ The childâthe boyâthe man are here: Ye may not see another year! Another year, another year, O! who shall see another year? âShall I, whose burning thirst of fame No earthly power can quench or tame? Alas! that burning thirst may soon Be o'er, and all beneath the moonâ All my fine visions, fancy-wrought, And all this vortex-whirl of thought For ever cease and disappear, Ere dawns on earth another year! 'Tis not by Day. 1824. Tis not by day, however bright The beauty of the day may be, 'Tis in the night, 'tis in the night, My holiest musings dwell on Thee! 'Tis true, thy glorious hand I view In every leaf that greens the tree; And not a floweret blooms in dew, But wakes some lovely thought of Thee! 'Tis true the mountain soaring high, The river rolling to the sea, The blue and boundless stretch of skyâ Bid the awed spirit turn to Thee. But few and brief such feelings are; From business and from day they flee; Ten thousand nameless chances jar On bosom-chords, though tuned to Thee. 'Tis in the night, when nought around The ear can hear, the eye can see; When all seems laid in sleep profound, Except my watching Soul and Thee; 'Tis then, my God! I feel thy power And love, from all distraction free; My couch is Heaven in that high hour! Thou'rt round meâI am wrapped in Thee! When Time my Youthful Eye. 1824. [Written under a Portrait.] When Time my youthful eye shall tame, And mark my youthful brow, Here, Ellen, shall they look the sameâ As smooth and bright as now. And O! if Fate should tear apart Two formed in love to dwellâ If death should chill the ardent heart That long hath loved and wellâ Here still, my dear, thy maiden choice Thine eyeâthrough tearsâmay see; And still shall I, with all but voice, Speak fondest love to Thee! Where, Loved One! is thy Dwelling now? 1824. [In memory of Miss Sarah Johnson, a fair pupil of mine, who died in her thirteenth year. She was the daughter of the late Thomas Johnson, Esq., of Eshton. Her mother, who survived her many years, was a warm and unchanging friend of mine; and, strangely enough, I am indebted, indirectly, to her (long after her own death) for the proudest event of my life.] âOnce, in thy mirth, thou bad'st me write on thee; And now I writeâwhat thou shalt never see?â Rogers. Where, loved One! is thy dwelling now? In scenes where thou wert wont to be, Thy laughing eye, thy open brow, Thy sylph-like form no more we see. There's grief around thy father's hearth, Which time shall scarcely change to mirth! There's weeping in thy father's hallâ Its chambers, which so lately rung To thy light step or lively call, Seem dark as if with sable hung. Too well their gloom declares that thou Hast left thy father's dwelling now! When last I looked upon thy face, Thy fair cheek wore a pallid hue; Yet kept thine eye its wonted grace, And wildly free thy dark hair flew. I little thought whose breath had passed Across thy features like a blastâ I little thought that Death had blown E'en then his sickening breath on thee! I little thought thy glance and tone Then spoke and beamed their last for me! My parting word unthinking fellâ I dreamt not of a last farewell! But the same Moon, whose crescent beam Beheld thee in accustomed bloom, Was seen to pour her waning stream Of dewy radiance round thy tomb: O loveliest and loved One, thou Hast found a darksome dwelling now! I went to where thy grave was scoopedâ There children, seeming half to grieve, Stood round, in gazing clusters grouped; I saw it, and could scarce believe So dark and damp a cell could be For aught so light and gay as thee! Yet so it was. I saw thee lowered, And heard upon thy coffin-lid With heavy sound the dull earth showered, Till dust by dust was heaped and hid; And looks I marked whose anguish said Life's highest charm with thee was dead! Then fled our frailest and our last Illusionâthat in which we think, While ours the dust whence life has passed, There still is one unshivered link. That the grave broke; and all of thee Hath faded to a memory! There was a time when âin thy mirthâ Thou archly âbad'st me write on thee;â And now, lost flower of fairest birth, âI writeâwhat thou shalt never see!â Alas, how sad a song hath paid Request scarce thought, and lightly made! But shall my song have mournful close? O! not for thee our tears should fall; Thou art where Spring eternal blowsâ Thou art where God is all in all! Thine claim our grief; but, loved One! thou Hast found a glorious dwelling now! The Wild Thyme still Blossoms. 1824. [Homil-heugh is the name of one of the Cheviot Hills, in the vicinity of Wooler. At the foot of this mountain was fought the celebrated battle in which Hotspur took Archibald, Earl of Douglas, and many others of the Scottish nobility prisoners. The ultimate consequences of that conflict to the House of Percy, are familiar to every reader of English history and of Shakspeare. The mountain is endeared to me by recollections of a thousand wanderings about it, in company with the subject of this lyricâJohn Smith, of Humbletonâthe most beloved, as he was the first, of my youthful friends.] The wild thyme still blossoms on green Homil-heugh, The daisy and crow-flower mingle there still; And the young, as in other years, climb it to view The wanderings bright of the Glen and the Till. But whereâwhere is He who delighted to view The charms of that valley from green Homil-heugh? O Memory! I need not invoke thee to roll Away the dark mists of long years, and to bring The light of that time on my sorrowing soul, When together we roved in our Manhood's gay spring; Too often, for happiness, pass in review The days we have spent upon green Homil-heugh! How we talked! as we loitered by dell or by shelf, Or sat on some moss-covered crag in the sunâ We spoke not of station, we spoke not of pelf, We talked but of Bards and the Glory they won: And bright were the hopesâah, to both how untrue!â Our young bosoms cherished on green Homil-heugh. O! who could have thought, that beheld the fair dawnâ Beheld of his Mind the first splendour unfurledâ That a dark cloud would o'er it so shortly be drawn, And its light be for ever eclipsed to the world? That the harp whose wild strains he so daringly threw So soon would be silent on green Homil-heugh? But 'tis so with all bright things. The rose newly blown Soon withers; the Sunbeam is quenched in the shower; The Rainbow just shines on the cloud, and is gone; The Lightning just flashes, and past is its power. And the soul of my first friend hath vanished like dew From the calm morning side of the green Homil-heugh! Mary Lee. 1824. [I was personally acquainted with all the parties mentioned in this Tale. The heroine was a reaper with me in the fields of Roddam. One word requires explanation. When a young man completes his apprenticeship, the merry-making with which he celebrates it is, in Northumberland, termed a Foy.] Yes! the red earth, the pebbles washed with rain, Which marked the spot where Sorrow wept in vain, Are hidden now. The turf, once piled so high That recent death was obvious to the eye, So much hath sunk into the bordering green, You scarce can tell that here a grave has been. The stranger's foot might spurn it, nor could know The relics of a Sister sleep below! See! the bright butterfly, on gorgeous wing, Holds its gay revel 'mid the beams of Spring; The wild bee, to his daily task addressed, From blade to floweret flits, and will not rest. And these are now the blithest sounds that come, That thoughtless flutter, and that busy humâ And these are now the blithest sights we see About the dwelling-place of Mary Lee! Poor Mary Lee! I knew her when the light Of sixteen summers in her eye laughed bright; And then, no fairer face than hers was seen, No lighter footstep on the village green. Favourite of all, whate'er she did was best, Hers was the sweetest song, the merriest jest. Whether they rescued, while the cold winds blow, (For such things are!) the turnip from the snow; Or turned the hay-swathe; or, in jovial band, Reaped the full harvest from the waving land; The foremost still in labour, as in glee, The soul of all their mirth was Mary Lee! Soon as the hawthorn whitens into flower, There wheels the blackbird, and there finds a bower; Soon as the girl to woman-beauty springs, There hovers Love, and there he rests his wings! And Mary's heart, with kindliest feelings fraught, Was early sued for, and was early caught. Love made her not less happy, and it bore No charm away by others prized before; Nay, she had sweetness which, before, amid The foliage of wild recklessness was hid; But, at Love's touch, 'twas scattered round her now On all she spoke withâas that hawthorn bough, Shook by the songster, sheds upon the gale Its hoarded breath in perfume o'er the vale! Apprenticed when a boy, the favoured Youth Who proffered love for love, and truth for truth, Had yet three years to serve, ere he with pride Could make, in prudence, Mary Lee his bride. But these departedâneed I tell you how? Why, still the tale was told, and vowed the vow, Th' embrace repeated, and the long, long kiss Which made them friends when aught had passed amiss. The Moon had never, from her pathway blue, Smiled on a purer pair!âBut why pursue The common tale, or why their bliss proclaim, Whose love is holy, and deserves the name? These years departed, and his Freedom Foy Bade the wide vale participate his joy; And all who saw but deemed it prelude gay To fairer pageant, and a happier day. When, from some cause or noneâsome trifleâgrew A coldness 'twixt the lovers erst so true; And ere the flame which still possessed each heart Could bid the chill, surrounding damp depart, And seek again its fellowâlight to lightâ Making the glow of passion doubly bright, Fate, like a cloud, its searchless volume bore Between themâand the meteors met no more! With him a moment stays my artless tale: He left his Mary, left his native vale; And joined bad men, from whom he learned to prove The wildering mazes of illicit love. He prospered like all others in that courseâ Had momentary joy, and long remorse, And wished at times to burst th' inglorious chain For Mary's smile and innocence again. Ah! this was but a transitory gleam Where all was darkening!âA delirious dream Of fancied wrong and fancied scorn from her Whom in his heart he could not but prefer, Inspired the thought that vengeance were a draught Well worth the quaffingâand he madly quaffed! A giddy girl, th' acquaintance of a night, Received the troth which Haste should never plight: But scarce the vow was said, the pageant o'er, When the spell broke, and he must dream no more! He raised his mental eye, and far above The rock's high summit walked his early love, The old love-smile yet brightening o'er her browâ Thence he had fall'n, and all was misery now! Meanwhile, in various guise, the tidings passed, Nor did they reach poor Mary's ear the last. The common eye observed not that they brought An added pang to those his absence wrought; But they who viewed her nearer, saw with pain The strife which Love and wounded Pride maintain. They marked the secret tear, the smothered moan, Th' unwonted musings which she held alone,â The all, in brief, that strikes observant eyes, When life's best charm with Hope, the Angel, flics! 'Twas a sweet night. The summer breeze, abroad, Just waved the Old Oak's shadow on the road; For the fair Moon in glory rolled aboveâ O! 'twas a night for love, and hearts that love! Poor Mary satâher 'customed labours o'erâ And eyed the moonshine stream athwart the floor; While Memory a heightening radiance cast On the too brilliant picture of the past. âHow oft,â she thought, âat such a time have I Been blessedâbeyond all bliss beneath the sky! At such a time the tap that spoke him here, Has come like sweetest music to my ear; And I have turned, and seen his manly form Distinctly stand in moonshine or in storm!â She raised her eyes, wet with the sick heart's dewâ Her lover at the casement stood in view! With step delirious from her seat she sprung, And the next moment round his neck she clung, And âO my love!â the Maid began to say, âHow long from me hath been thy weary stay! The rest have had their loversâI alone Had none to speak with at the fold or loan. O! I have watched for theeâalong the path, Thy usual foot-way through the lonely strath, Till tree and bush, in twilight vapours seen, Have ta'en thy figureâe'en thy step and mien! Nay, I have met thee, when it darker frowned, Thine arms extended as to clasp me round; Twas but a phantom of the heated brain! I shuddering turned, and, hurrying home again, There stretched me on my couchâO not to sleep! But till the stars grew dim, to wake and weep; And then to dream of horrorsârivals gay And bridal splendoursâtill the blush of day! For it was whispered to meâbut I knew The dreadful rumour never could be trueâ That thou wert now a guilty thing, and lost To every virtue once thy noble boast; That thou hadstâââO my Mary, name it not! Be what is said, and what is done, forgot. The world has other climes, where thou mayst be Blest in thy Charles, and I in Mary Lee.â âThere spoke my love, as he was wont to do Ere envious tongues described his heart untrue! The bells shall ring, and bid the joyous gale Waft the blithe tidings round and round the valeâ While I, in robes of shining whiteness dressed, An emblem of the bright love in my breast, Joining thy proud step proudly, by thy side Shall move along, thy day-acknowledged bride! How will they look to see it, they who spread The baseless falsehood that my Charles was wed! But what of other climes, love? Didst thou speak Of other climes, as things that we must seek? Never, as yet, have opened to my view The secrets hid behind yon mountains blue; But the most distant and most desert spot Shall be my choice, if there is cast thy lot! One thing premisedâour Village Church has heard My parents' prayers and mine to heaven preferred; Its spire's rough tones, to mountain and to dell, Have rung their bridal peal, and funeral knell; And their poor Orphan must not leave the place With dubious stigma, or with sure disgrace! But still my senses dream! My love, my life, Asks not my company but as hisâWife?â She raised her face, as if from his to seek Th' assurance which his lip forbore to speak; But he had turned his head, and gazed on high Where thousand brilliants gemmed the azure sky, And Mary felt that, agonised with grief, His whole frame quivered like the aspen leaf. Abrupt he spoke: âThe truth must be avowed, Though Heaven's red ire should flash without a cloud! He paused, as if to see the lightning glare, But all was calm, and still, and lambent there. â'Tis vain! it flashed not o'er my impious vowâ It slumbered thenâand will not waken now. Then, though thy curse should blast me where I stand, I am another'sânot in heartâbut hand!â Not sooner, had the fate-winged lightning broke, Of whose quick agency he wildly spoke, Could the poor Maid have sunk before himâpale As the white rose-leaf that bestrews the gale! Her lover's cry of sudden horror brought The startled inmates of the peaceful cot, Who found him bent above the seeming dead, To which he mutely pointed themâand fled. The Youth is goneâbut whither, none can say. On sick-bed long the hapless Mary lay. Her health returned, such health as lent her frame A languid strength; but never more there came To her that buoyancy of heart and soul, Those playful moods that wont to spurn control. True, she at times would laugh, at times would smile, At times would sing the songs she loved erewhile; But all was done, as if the mind no part Took in the general business of the heart! She smiled, but none knew why; she laughed aloud, But the loud laugh, mistimed, alarmed the crowd; And when she sung, however blithe the strain, A sense of horror thrilled the listening train! She stood, the victim of an inward strife Destructive of her reason or her life. Weeks glided on. At length a billetâplanned By a sick heart, and in a trembling handâ Was laid before her. Thus its tenor ran: âMy Mary! I am now a dying man, Whom the green turf will wrap, before this sheet, Charged with my love, thy virtuous eye can meet. We meet no more on earth; butâwere it given To Guilt thus much to hopeâwe shall in heaven. The stroke which frees me from each mortal chain, Leaves thee to deem me all thine own again; Again thy mind may, blameless, think on me, Whose latest thought shall dwell on Mary Lee!â âA postscript, added by a stranger, told The writer's hand was stiff, his heart was cold. Mary perused it; but no tearâno sighâ Rose from her breast, or trickled from her eye. Astonished gazers saw her eye assume Celestial light, her cheek celestial bloom; And breathing thus of seraph-charms, she cried âO I am happy now!â and, smiling, died. Ah! Will there a Time Come. 1824. Ah! will there a time come, when coldly above me The earth of the valley I tread shall be laid; When the tears of the few that now cling to and love me, Unheeded shall fallâlike the dew in the shade? When each charm, and each change, and each scene it delights me To note and remember, to me shall be o'er; When all that to song or to musing invites me, To musing or song shall invite me no more? When rainbows o'er green, gleaming landscapes shall brighten, And melody warble from grove and from sky; When tempests shall howl, or grim thunder-clouds lighten, And my breast give no throb, and no sparkle my eye? When Springs shall refreshen the hues of the mountain, And Summers begem with young blossoms the lea; And Autumns with red leaves bestrew the chill fountain, And white winters dazzleâunwitnessed by me? So be it! if, borne on the bright stream of ages, The wreath I have gathered, its freshness retain,â Nor sink, till the chaplets of bards and of sages Alike shall be lost in Eternity's main! Edward Stanley. 1824. Who hath not felt, when rolls the passing-bell Along the burthened air its heavy knell, How wild the soundsâfor whomsoe'er it toll? It seems as if the newly parted Soul Lingered a space, ere from the world she flew, And spoke in those deep tones her last adieu! âSuch were the sounds along the vale that sighed The calm sweet eve when Edward Stanley died; And aged men who heard them on the breeze, Shook their gray heads, and said that sounds like these, So dull and heavyâbore a presage drear Of other deaths and funeral-pageants near. 'Twas a weak thought; yet deep the death-bell sighed The calm sweet eve when Edward Stanley died! Born in a cot, whose little casement bright, And blue smoke curling in the morning light Cheered with an air of life a mountain glen, But seldom trodden by the feet of men, Beneath a widowed Mother's partial view, Like some fair blossom Edward Stanley grew. Few are the years, and soon they pass away, Allowed by poverty to thoughtless play; And forced for bread, when scarcely more than child, To follow flocks that bleat along the wild, He never knew, to early hardship bred, The dreamy raptures of the sluggard's bed; But ever at the cock's first larum shrill, Started from dreamless sleep, and climbed the hill. âPerchance the wintry morn was cold and clear, And stars burnt faintly as the day drew near, And his eye caught and gazed upon that one Which lovelier seemed to him than all that shone, Because the Hymn his mother taught to say, Compared his Saviour to the Star of day! âPerchance a frost-mist, thick and heavy, wove Its mimic verdure over lawn and grove, And he a steep and darksome way must tread Ere he attain the mountain's sun-gilt head. Thence looking round, his wonder into speech Breaks forthâthough other ears it cannot reach; For all below in vapour white is hid, And his own mountainâlike an isle amid The oceanâonly bears its top sublime Above the calm and boundless sea of rime, O'er which the sun, in lonely grandeur rolled, Pours his first hues of crimson and of gold! âPerchance delicious Summer, calling out All sights of beauty, breathed her airs about, Gave a flushed whiteness to the daisied dell, Green to the grove, and purple to the fell. Then, on the heights 'mid fragrant heath reclined, All he beheld was nutriment for mindâ The earth's fair face below, and, spread on high, The blue eternal of the vaulted sky, Which seemed as wove by Love's own hand, to span The bright and beauteous world of favoured manâ The clouds, like ships which wafting winds convey For ever sailing onâawayâawayâ Each was a source of thought and inward joy To that meek, lonely, meditative Boy, Of thought so holy, and of joy so deep, The young enthusiast must pray or weep! So passed his year. But when from distant dells Floated the morning chimes of Sabbath bellsâ When calm was all the air, when in the cloud, The lark's strain softened into notes less loud, And e'en the mountain rivulet seemed to gush With murmur chastened to the sacred hushâ Young Edward, in his Sunday garments clad, Marched by his Mother's side sedately glad; Leaped with a bound the churchyard stile, but trod With reverential step the holy sodâ Viewed with a sigh of mingled grief and awe Memorials of a sire he never sawâ The plain, white, lettered stone, and half-sunk heap, At which the lonely widow paused to weep. In church, where gothic arch, and sculptured wall, And sunbeams richer from their broken fall, To Edward's unsophisticated youth Increased the force of each familar truth, On him who spoke he gazed with thoughtful eye, The holy man commissioned of the sky, And said with rising heartââO what can be So happy as the lot assigned to thee!â Nor vanished then the thought, but served for talk With his loved Mother on their homeward walk. The following eve, his parent's board beside, He sipped the juice by China's herb suppliedâ A prized indulgence! Of the beverage mild He drained his little cup, and archly smiled, Shaking the settled leaves,ââOh, you shall be To-day the ancient gipsey-wife to me, And read my fortune, mother!â He took up, And gave into her hand the thrice-twirled cup. But eager into destiny to look, The listener's passive part he soon forsook, Joined in the scrutiny, and first, elate, Became the gay interpreter of fateâ â'Tis there, 'tis there! I seeâI see it all; The front, fair-windowed, of a parson's hall; The church behind; the fresh green glebe before; The pony pasturing by the coach-house door! And see, a table spread; and see, a pair At dinner or at tea are seated thereâ 'Tis you and I, my mother! O I'll make Your heart so happy that it ne'er shall ache!â Slight means will stem a rivulet near the source, And give a new direction to its course; From superstitious sign, but half believed, Thus Edward's future life its bent receivedâ A scholar's praise, a pastor's reverenced name, Thenceforth the objects of his heart became. O! who can tellâsave they whose youth has borneâ The ills a peasant boy must bear and scorn, Ere he can conquer circumstance, and reach Proprieties of style and charms of speech! The child of rank patrician, learns by ear A language elegant, correct, and clear; Books, when his subsequent regard they claim, Speak in a tongue familiar and the same; And rules of writing but their sanction add To perfect modes of speechâhe knows no bad. But when to him of rustic parents bred, The young aspirant of the straw-roofed shed, Whose dialect the store of words unfolds The poor man's poor vocabulary holdsâ To such when Learning deigns to spread her page, She speaks the language of the world's first age; Her words are strange, her illustrations dim, Her definitionsâundefined to him! Through dictionaries huge, and grammars dry, He pores with aching brain, and weary eye, And heart that would despairâdid not the Power That animates us on from hour to hour, Point with fair finger to the severing cloudâ The dawn's mild azureâand the rising proud Of bright Success! Young Edward soon had caught Whate'er the skill of village masters taught. Voiced as a prodigy by rural fame, A neighbouring Squire with wonder heard his name, Found him a brilliant proof, that rank and birth Engross not all the intellect of earth, And gained the praise the Great too seldom claim, Of aiding Genius on his road to fame. On Edward's heart his patron's bounty fell Like showers of summer on the long-parched dellâ Freshening the green corn, till it waves to hope The glittering promise of a splendid crop! The confidence which Genius gives, had saidâ âPress onâthou hast no foe, save Want, to dread!â That foe was vanquishedâGlory's path was clearâ And Edward entered on his bright career. With speed proportioned to his ardent will, He rose on Learning's far-retiring hill, Till purer air he breathed, and saw where, foiled, His duller seniors far beneath him toiled. But without toil were his attainments made? Noârising suns his studious hours surveyed; And stars ascended o'er the eastern hill, Rolled half their course, and found him sleepless still! To friends, who trembled at the zeal which shed Along his cheek a high consumptive red, âThe wheel must turn and turn, till life be o'er!â An expression of the poet Leyden when remonstrated with for over-studying. He mildly said, and studied as before. E'en his amusements, snatched at morning's rise Or evening's fall, were studies in disguise. Then did his mind the many charms engage, That glow in Milton's or in Shakspeare's page, Pope's polished couplets, touched and touched again, Or Dryden's freer and far manlier strain. To these, the master-minds of British song, His breast responded with pulsations strong; And rumour said that, kindled at their fire, He waked at times an emulative lyre. But this was mere conjecture; or, if true, He left no relics of the strains it threw. 'Twas drawn from words which, when on death-bed laid, To one poor listener Edward feebly said: âMother! I feel Death's hand is on me now, And I shall soon be dustâand childless thou! Thy pride in me, thy hopes, andâwilder stillâ My own wild wishes scarcely time could fill, All crushed and blighted now! O weep not so!â This world, they tell us, is a world of woe; I think not thus. For, ever to my sight Its flowers were lovely, and its skies were bright; And I had feelings, whence I know not given, Which I for years would keepânor long for Heaven! Nay, deem me not profane; Heaven may be fair, But Earth has triumphs which I burned to share! âMother! when comes (but do notâdo not weep!) The hour that lays me where my fathers sleep, I would not wish above my mouldering dust The cumbrous marble placed, or breathing bustâ (O! on such trophies, by the dead unfelt, My waking dreams have fondly, vainly dwelt!) Amid the rural churchyard's peaceful green, Where sunbeams fall, and early flowers are seen, Where the sweet redbreast, from adjoining yew, Pours the soft song to spot so holy due, May my last slumber be! and o'er my grave, Its only honours, wilding blossoms waveâ There Spring's fair hand the primrose-knot bestow, And Summer there the hardier daisy throw; And long may these, by blighting storms unscathed, Before the sun expandâin dews of morning bathed!â He diedâand so his humble grave they placed, And such the flowers with which its turf is graced Nor could Affection choose a fitter wreath To honour him who calmly sleeps beneath. Be Still, my Wild Heart. 1825. [On seeing a rural dance at Gargrave feast.] Be still, my wild heart! in that throb there was sin, For each throb of thine is another's by vow; And the maid 'twas my fortune to woo and to win, Was fair as the fairest I look upon now. As light was her step, and as winningly shy Her glances, as any commanding applause; And if a slight change hath come over herâwhy Should he love her less who himself is the cause? All the rapture of hopeâall the pain of suspenseâ All the charm of pursuit have been known to my soul; Andâcrownedâshall I view with an envious sense The pleasures of those that yet strive for the goal? No! 'twas but my heart that, oblivious awhile, Leaped back to a time when its pulses were free; Butâawakenedâits beatings are true to the smile Of Her whose warm heart is devoted to me! Shake from thee that Rain-drop. 1825. [The âspoilerâ in the last stanza was my eldest daughterâthen a child of a year old.] Shake from thee that rain-dropâas pure as dew, And open, sweet violet, thy foldings blue! For the soft shower is over, the sun from the edge Of the cloud hath streamed out on the young-leaved hedge; The song of the blackbird is sweet in the larch; The sky-lark sings on the rainbow's arch; The breeze is as gentle as breeze may be, It would sport with, but never would injure thee! With her varied dress and her soothing hum, To thee from afar hath the wild bee come; She hath bent thy stalkâshe hath dashed the rain From thy headâand thy leaves expand again; And the blended perfumes which, all around, Arise from the herbs of the moistened ground, From sweet-brier bush, and from hawthorn-tree, Are forgot in the fragrance exhaled from thee! The bee hath departed to other bowers, To hum and to banquet on other flowers. But a surer spoiler now is nigh, With a rose-bright cheek, and a star-bright eye, With hair like the sunbeams, and lipsâbut I pause, For a father's pencil the portrait draws; Enough, that no lovelier hand can be, Than the dear little hand that now seizes thee! Fitz-Hartil. 1825. [The hintâfor it is no moreâof this tale may be found in Whitaker's âHistory of Craven.â It is to the effect that a young man, residing in the village of Hartlington, was roused from sleep one night, by a voice that cried, âRise, and save life!â He ran to where the voice seemed to come from, and had the pleasure of saving the honour and perhaps the life of a lady, who, tradition says, was one of the Clifford family. I have altered the name of the hero from Fitz-Harcla, in deference to the wish of my friend, James Henry Dixon, Esq., author of several beautiful songs, and editor of âAncient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England,â a gentleman whose taste in all literary matters is not to be neglected with safety. There was a time when Craven saw, From fair St. Ives The beautiful seat of W. B. Ferrand, Esq. to Outershaw, One forest stretch o'er hill and vale, Unlimited by fence or pale, Where free by dell and greenwood glade, The deer of stout De Clifford strayed. From peasant's bolt or outlaw's spear, That lord to save his forest deer, Had many a ranger tried and bold In Lodges scattered o'er the wold. Of these blithe guardians of the game Lived oneâFitz-Hartil was his name. The Wharf in fury and in foam, Impetuous, passed his sylvan home. For length of wind, and length of limb, No ranger trod the wild like him. No boar so fierce in Barden dell, But he with hunting spear could quell; There lived not man beneath the sun Whom he, in deadly strife, would shun. On to the distant mark in view His cross-bow's bolt unerring flew; His arrow, fledged with gray goose wing, The eagle from the cloud could bring, Or, at a hundred paces' stand, Divide the hazel's slender wand. In brief, 'twas said the feats so long Preserved in Sherwood's tale and song, And long unrivalled, shrunk at length Before Fitz-Hartil's skill and strength. The sun was set. The tints of eve The western sky began to leave. Like thread of silver, faint and far, The new Moon hung beside her star. Of hawthorn-blossoms, bursting round, Of wild flowers, viewless on the ground, The soft gale breathed. Fitz-Hartil stood Delighted 'mid the fresh green wood. He stoodâno maiden had a part In the young Ranger's simple heart; The evening star 'twas his to spy Without a dream of Beauty's eye; The flowers might blossomâscent nor streak Told him of Beauty's breath or cheek; And yet that night, in loitering mood, Amid the grove Fitz-Hartil stood! A deeper and a deeper shade Fell round him. Wondering why he stayed. He called his dog, and hastened on; But not ten paces had he gone, When a tall rock, abrupt and gray, Arose and barred his further way. The Ranger pausedâno spot of ground To him was strange for leagues around, And well he weened no day had e'er Looked on the rock ascending there; Yet there it was; immenseâand dimâ And thrown betwixt his path and him! While yet he wondered, from the rock Sounds of the dance and music broke, Music so soft, so sweet as ne'er Before had charmed Fitz-Hartil's ear! And then, too, with the mirthful din, A beam of lightâshot from withinâ Showed to the Ranger, half-entranced, The elfin forms of those that danced! âThe Youth to many a fairy tale Had listened in his native dale With doubt, if not with scorn; but here Fitz-Hartil saw, and saw with fear; For the âgood neighbours,â well he knew, Though often kind, malignant too. He crossed himself, and tried to say An Ave Mary as he may; Then peeped, 'twixt joy and fear, to see The fairies at their revelry. Wideâloftyâlongâthe cavern seemed, But there no lamp nor taper gleamed; Along the sides, and overhead, Brilliants, as thick as dew-drops, shed A rich and tender light, as though Ten thousand glow worms lent their glow! In that undazzling light serene Were tiny knights and ladies seen, Arrayed in garb of forest green, Who, fast as gnats in sunshine glance, Blended the ever-varying dance! As gazed Fitz-Hartil curiously The minstrels ceased their minstrelsy. The dancers at the sign divide, Disposed in ranks on every side, Leaving all clear the space betweenâ And the young Ranger's eye hath seen A pair upon a natural dais Of turf and flowers assume their place; The one a knight, with gems and gold Glittering upon his mantle's fold, And one a lady young and fair, With what seemed jewels in her hair, And o'er whose shoulders, freshly wreathed, Garlands of wild-flowers bloomed and breathed! Fitz-Hartil gazed, admiring, till He saw set forth by fairy skill What served for table, raised between The rows, and all of turf so green; Which soon was decked by nimble hands With cupsâlike shells from Ocean's sands; When now one rose, and wildly rung The echoing cavern as she sung: Song. We have been at the sea, where the billows foamed free, To gather the pearls for our hall; Their love-lighted lamps, from hawthorns and swamps, The glow worms have brought at our call. The bee we have spoiledâher stinging we foiledâ Of the very best hoard to-day; And the milk from the dam that she meant for the lamb, We have drained and brought it away. But noble and great, with honours and state, That man shall suddenly be, Whose dairy unsealed the butter shall yield That pleases our fair Ladye. And yellow as gold, or the king-cup's fold, And sweet as the dews of May, The butter must be to please our Ladye In the eve of her bridal day! âTo Burnsall go!â Fitz-Hartil cried, âAnd from my Dairy be supplied!â He spoke forgetful, and a space His heart beat quick, when all the place Echoed as from a thousand lipsâ âThanks, mortal, thanks! In dark eclipse No more shall rest thy merit! Be A son of immortality! Rich in thy life, and in thy death Encircled with Affection's breath, And borne to distant times along By warm tradition, and by song! âMortal, approach, and let this token Confirm the promise we have spoken; Withdraw, and all that we have said Shall turn to curses on thy head!â Forward the bold Fitz-Hartil went, Much marvelling no impediment Of rock opposed his step. He took The proffered cup, though tremour shook His outstretched hand and pallid lipâ St. Mary! will Fitz-Hartil sip? He sipped, rash youth! and saw no more, But sank upon the cavern floor. Morn with her warm and rosy beam Awakened him as from a dream. The birds sang sweet, the freshening breeze Opened the flowers and stirred the trees. Amazed he rose. The rock immense, The cavern's wild magnificence, Were vanished all; and sunbeams played Upon a vacant forest glade! He called his dogâit came not nigh; He wound his horn with summons high; Then, thoughtful, through the lonely strath He slowly traced his homeward path. His simple mind bewildered all, He strove the vision to recall: The rockâthe caveâthe lightâthe songâ The charmÃ¨d cupâthe fairy throng Came o'er his mind in rich confusion; It could not be!â'twas all delusion! Some fairy tale, in memory kept, Had formed the picture while he slept. He came to this conclusion wise Just as his cottage met his eyesâ Its woodbined casement glancing bright, Its azure smoke ascending light, Its opening door from which a train Of dogs their welcome barked amain, All blitheâsave one, whose drooping plight Betrayed the recreant of the night. Long since Fitz-Hartil's sire had been Interred in Burnsall's churchyard green. His mother, Mistress of the dome, Industrious, ruled the Ranger's home; And much alarm the good old dame Had suffered till Fitz-Hartil came. Yet her inquiries led him not To mention of the fairy grotâ He told of being, and he smiled, O'erta'en by sleep in forest wild; And how he slept till morning broke, And hungry as a greyhound woke. The matron then produced her cheerâ A pasty, like a peel, Peelâa small castle. of deer; Of rich and unskimmed milk a bowl; A mighty cheese supports the whole. âButter, and then,ââthe Ranger cried, âButterâSt. Mark!â the dame replied, âThe pantry, though so stored last night, Of butter now is empty quite! Thieves! thieves!ââthen dread denouncings ran, And hearty was the housewife's ban. âMuch mused Fitz-Hartil now, yet nought Allowed to 'scape of what he thought. 'Twas plain his 'venture, though it seem So wild, had been no idle dream; He had beheld the fairy throng, Tasted their cheer, and heard their song! Where might it end?âHopes new and bright Danced in the Ranger's mental sight. When spring's green buds to leaves had grown, And wild-brier roses all were blown, On couch of heath, with thoughtful mind, One night Fitz-Hartil lay reclined. The moon looked in with calmest beam; And, but for Wharf's resounding stream, Upon the muser's ear arose No sound to break the still repose. âAt once was dimmed the mooshine's fall, At once a voice was heard to call: âFitz-Hartil rise, and come away! The cause forbids a moment's stayâ A precious life's in jeopardyâ Up, up at once, and follow me!â Upsprung the youth. With hurried hand He seized, and buckled on his brand, His quiver fixed, and round him threw His mighty bow of trusty yew,â Then followed, with his swiftest stride, The flying footsteps of his guide, Who, as they crossed the dewy plain, Sung, sweetly wild, the sequent strain: Song. 'Tis lovely! for on high A thin mist veils the sky, And gives richnesss to the mild yellow moon; And the gentle light of day Seems scarcely gone away, But mingles with the summer night's noon! 'Tis lovely! for the wood Throws its shadows on the flood, And the flood lies so calm and so pureâ In its depth it seems to show Yet a sweeter world below, More delicately bright or obscure! Awayâawayâaway! There is night and there is day, And villains veil their crimes from the one; But guilt that shuns the light, Will do its deed by nightâ Away, happy youth, hasten on! Such was the strain his leader sung, Fitz-Hartil knew the fairy's tongue. They paused where trees a shadow made; A shriek was heard from neighbouring shade; And soon the Ranger's eye could mark, Beneath a pine-tree broad and dark, A lady struggling in the gripe Of ruffiansââMortal! fate is ripe,â Exclaimed the fairy. âBend thy bow, And lay the shameless villains low; And if no meed thy effort crown, 'Twill be because thou art aâclown. This chance thy kindness gains from me; Farewellâthe rest depends on thee.â His trusty bow Fitz-Hartil drew, The whizzing dart unwavering flew; One ruffian fell, the other fledâ But one more arrow, vengeful, sped! A stifled groan, a shiver more, And life and agony are o'er! Fitz-Hartil ran and raised the maid Extended in the pine-tree's shade. He waked her from a death-like swoon, Then stood astonishedâfor the Moon Showed him, with life's returning glow, The eye of light, the neck of snow, The lovely brow, the sunny hair Of bold De Clifford's daughter fair! âOft had he seen her with his lord, By thronging knights almost adored, On palfrey light with silver bells Urge the gay chase in Craven's dells; Himself the while, amid such stir, Not all unmarked of them and her. His archer skill, his bearing bold, By all that saw them were extolled; And she has said he walked the earth With the free step of lofty birth. Glad was, I ween, the lady fair To waken in the Ranger's care. With voice more mellow than the tone Of redbreast in the woods alone, She thanked him for her life, or yet More dear, her honour; spoke of debt Immense, which far as favours may, Her sire would, she was sure, repay. Fitz-Hartil said what any one So placed, so feeling, might have done, But with a grace unknown to all Save those who move in courtly hallâ Such is th' effect of fairy charm! The lady took his proffered arm, And as they traced the moonlight wold, Her 'venture to her saviour told. âThe wretch your timely arrow sent Unshrived, alas! to punishment, Of high and noble lineage came, And bore, himself, a noble name. But what is name, or fameâif vice Deprives the jewel of its price? This worthless heart to win he strove, And felt, or feigned, the warmth of love. Fitz-Hartil, hear my soul avow I hated him I pity now! Piqued by my scorn, this evening he Stole on my walk's green privacy, Seized both my hands with sudden claspâ Stifled my shriek with rudest graspâ And bore me through the forest shades; That other wretchâhis menialâaids. Some angel sent thee, sure, in time To mar the meditated crime!â Such was her tale. Romances light Have made to us the story trite; But to Fitz-Hartil it was new, And strange, and villanous, and trueâ And as he walked, emotions high Now flushed his brow, now dewed his eye! 'Tis whispered, tooâthough scarce I dare My credit in the tale declareâ That while they towards his cottage stepped, And while by turns he chafed and wept, The lady, by his feeling swayed, The secret of her soul betrayed. It might be so. In days of old The language of the heart was told. I only know, a modern dame Would pauseâbefore she did the same. I may not linger in my lay To track them as they wend their way. 'Twere meeter here to tell of all That happed in Skipton's castle-hall. Where mourned with lamentation wild De Clifford for his vanished child; How horsemen thence wÃ©re hurried forth To east, to west, to south, to north, And all returning as they went Increased the clamour and lament. 'Twere better still, had I the power, To paint the joy at matin hour, When, leaning on Fitz-Hartil's arm, Returned the maid devoid of harm; When bold De Clifford heard her tell The 'venture o'er as it befellâ Heard her most eloquent justice do To the young Ranger's courage trueâ And vowed, by every saint above, To guerdon well the deed of love. Fitz-Hartil's to the greenwood gone To sigh by cliff and stream alone. The lady, in her father's bower, Sighs, too, or weeps away the hour. Her cheek is pale; her eyes of blue Have lost the glance they lately threw; Her harp is seldom touched; her lute Is now at eve in turret mute. De Clifford sees a shadow dim The fairest light that shines for him! âThe young were summoned to his hall, Tried were the banquet and the ball; But nought, beyond the moment, e'er Her heart's despondence seemed to cheer. At length the truth, by all discerned Or guessed, the startled father learnedâ âBlows the wind thence?â De Clifford cried, âMy daughter be my Ranger's bride? Where then were that pure blood sent down From many a Chief of high renown? Sullied by that of peasants?âNo! But gaining thence a healthier flow. Courage and Worth th'ennoblers are, Not the vain ribbon, string, or star. For once at least, though sneer the proud, A Peasant's worth shall be allowed; For once shall Rank his hosts remove, And leave the field to conquering Love!â Brightly the summer sunbeams fell On Skipton's tower and fair chapelle When, blushing, to the altar's side, Fitz-Hartil led his lovely bride. âAll o'er the path they walked upon Were fresh and dewy flowers bestrown; But, to the wonder of the train, The hands that strewed unseen remain; Though still, as on the Bridal passed, Fresh blooms descended thick and fast! None but Fitz-Hartil knew what fair And friendly hands were busy thereâ A happy omen thence he drew, Which many a brilliant year proved true. Mark, Ellen, how Fair. 1826. Mark, Ellen, how fair on the wild-brier bush The last single blossom appears! A rose of September, that ventures to blush Where nothing defends it or cheers. Though the sun be o'erclouded, the breezes be chill, And though bitter showers o'er it have passed, Round the green boughs that bear itâdefying each illâ Its balm and its beauty are cast! And seems it not, Ellen, as lonely it blooms, Like the last of our fair summer friends, Who clings to us still, though the atmosphere glooms, And the tempest in fury descends? Yet it cannot, my love, be an emblem of thee: When my youth and my fortune are past, Thy love shall suivive, and o'er life's withered tree Its balm and its beauty be cast! Long within the Danish Camp. 1826. My first dream of King Alfred and of Guthrum. Long within the Danish camp Had the sound of wassail rung; In the King's pavilion long Had the Danish minstrels sung; When a Saxon bard there came With a harp of simplest frame, But the notes were notes of flame Which it flung! I may not give his layâ It hath suffered wrong from time, And its spirit ill would brook The gyves of modern rhyme. To old Denmark's name it rose, In her glory rung its close, And the cheers of England's foes Drowned the chime. But beneath the seeming praise There lay irony and scorn, Which the jealous bards have caught, And have round in whispers borne. The King and nobles laughed At the hints they gave, and quaffed But a deeper, merrier draught Till the morn. The morn had scarcely broke On the land and on the wave, When around the Danish camp Thronged the flower of England's braveâ Still beamed the morning star From its misty heights afar, When the Danes awoke to war, And the grave! That minstrel led the fight! He was England's martial lord, The glo ous Alfred famed For the lyre as for the sword. Joy, joy to tower and town! Joy, joy to dale and down! Our Monarch to his crown Is restored! I gang frae Thee. 1826. [I was musing on Northumberland, and humming the air of Macneil's song of âThe Way for to Woo,â when the last half stanza of the following lyric came spontaneously, as it were, and adapted itself to the music. I thought it good enough to deserve an introduction, which is correct in feeling, though not entirely so in fact.] I gang frae thee, gang frae thee sadly, Dear land where a bairnie I played; I gang frae thee, gang frae thee sadly, Dearland where my manhood has strayed. And here in a last lookâif tears will but let meâ I'll bear wi' me far a strang picture o' thee; And go where I may, I will never forget thee, The bonniest lands 'ill kythe barren to me. Through vales where my fate bids me wander, The streams may flow on wi' mair pride, But nae charm will they hae, when I ponder, The charms o' my ain Beaumont-Side. When wave their green woods in the dews o'the morning, I'll think o' the lang broom that yellows yon glen; When they talk o' their high hills and brag o' them scorning, I'll think o' the Cheviots, and scorn them again. My heart has been lang cauld to beautyâ My first, only love lies in clay! And I canna allow it a duty, My breast that another should sway. And yet, did I wander the wide warl' ever, I should ne'er meet wi'forms nor wi'faces to peer The clean cottage maids that ted hay by yon river, Or lighten the hairst-field wi' laugh and wi' jeer. Fareweel to thee, land o' my childhood! When far frae thy beauties I dee, My last wish, dear land o' my childhood, Shall rise for a blessing on theeâ âHealthy,â I'll cry, âgush thy streams frae their fountains, Birds in thy broomy glens sing the lang day, Lambs bleat alang the green sides o'thy mountains, And lasses bleach claes by ilk bonnie burn-brae!â Beaumont Side. 1826. [On Lanton Hill, as on Howsden, I kept sheep when a boy. It, too, overlooks the Beaumont.] O beaumont side!âThe banks of Aire Before that flash of memory fade; And Lanton Hills are towering there, With Newton's vale beneath them laid. There wave the very rock-sprung trees My curious youth with wonder eyed, And here the long broom scents the breezeâ The yellow broom of Beaumont Side! On these hill-tops, at break of day, My feet have brushed the pearly dew, And I have marked the dawn-star's ray Lost in the orient's kindling blue; Then turned to see each neighbouring height In Morning's rosy splendours dyed,â While mists ascending, calm and white, Disclosed the banks of Beaumont Side. No passion thenâand unpursued The phantom hopes of Love and Fame; My breast, with piety imbued, Admittedâknewâno other flame. The hill, the stream, the flower, the tree, The wandering cloud, and ether wideâ All spoke of glorious things to me, The lonely Boy of Beaumont Side! For then, as yet untaught to scoff At all my simple sires believed, I had not joined the Scorner's laugh, Nor night instead of day received. Amid yon broom, my Bible dear, And David's harp my joy and pride, I felt as Angels hovered nearâ Was half in heaven on Beaumont Side! But shadows dim the sunniest hill, And dark thoughts o'er my spirit spedâ For yonder lay the churchyard still, With all its time-collected dead. And O! to me it seemed so sad For ages in the grave to 'bide, No breeze to blow, no sun to glad!â My tears fell fast on Beaumont Side. âWhy weep, fond Boy?â a kind voice said, â'Tis but the shell that wastes in earth.â I dashed away the tear just shed, And knew me of immortal birth! âI ask not Glory's cup to drain, I ask not Wealth's unebbing tide! O for the Innocence again My young heart knew on Beaumont Side! Sun-Gleams along the Mountains. 1827. [These lines have been admired. They form the introduction to an ill-natured Satire, published in this year. It was much criticised at the time, but it is now deservedly forgotten.] Sun-gleams along the Mountains, bright and strong, Flashed from betwixt the clouds that eastward throngâ Showing, in passing light, the hill-rock stern, The heath deep-waving, and the dark-green fern! Sun-gleams along the Valleys! soft and fair, As if etherial creatures wandered there, Invisible to mortal eye, and known But by the splendours round their motions thrown. Spring is abroad, and Earth and Air confess His mighty power to renovate and bless; Sounds the green land, of happy voices full, And decked with flowers that court the hand to cull. Dark discontents with winter's glooms depart, And the pulse quickens of the coldest heart! Not cold, but yet depressed, mine feels the thrill Of former springs, it wakes to rapture still. Maugre the critic's sneer, the world's neglect, And moreâmy almost-vanished self-respect, My heart flings off the stupor, felt so long, Hears the old call, and rushes into Song! The Mood is on my Soul. 1827. [On seeing a favourite tree, which grew in a field belonging to the late Mrs. Watkinson, of Gargrave, felled and lopped. This lady was one of my first Craven patrons. The mood is on my soul! the mood which bards Call inspirationâwhen some fancy bright, Or feeling strong, comparedâ And not inaptly soâ To breeze and sunshine, strikes the frozen mind, And melts it to its fount, until it flows, O'ergushing from its depth, In measure and in song! The mood is on my soul! But not for this Expect heroic strain, or aught that tells Of danger or of death From steel or woman's eye; The Muse shall stoopâand haply not in vainâ To humble theme. Empowered to climb the stars, She yet will pluck a flower From Earth's most lowly vale. Here lies a stately Tree! The axe and saw Have done their work on what full many a Spring Hath shed its rains and dewsâ Full many a Summer found In all its green magnificence of shadeâ Full many an Autumn hung with glowing goldâ And many a Winter shook With blast and roaring storm. The woodbine, whose slight tendrils clung so fast Around its base, and rendered by its blooms Beauty for aid received, All torn and trampled now, Shall never moreâor sicklyâgive to Spring Its clustered flowersâlike Bard, unblest by wealth, When falls the patron-lord His grateful verse repaid! Where shall the blackbird now, the speckled thrush, Or throstle sweet repair? When May returns, And in the snow-white thorn The female warms her young, Where shall the partner of her care and joy Find his accustomed bough, from which to pour The melody he means Shall thrill his feathered love? For them new thorns will blossomâother trees Wave greenly for endearment or for song, And this by me alone Perchance be mourned and missedâ A Dreamer whose fine joys and sorrows spring From fountains to the worldling all unknown, And which, if now exposed, He could not, would not prize. Aye, there thou liest! branchlessâbareâamid The thin and skeleton leaves, stripped from thy boughs By last December's windsâ And to that fibrous heap No winter shall behold thee add again. Spring, that was wont to wake thee, shall but clothe With verdure thy dead roots, And hide the ruin there! Ah! is it not e'en thus the grave conceals Her who but lately wandered in thy shade, And in these verdant fieldsâ These verdant fields her own! Good without pride, and generous without show, To her th' unsheltered flewâas birds to theeâ And in her kindness found A shade from sun and storm! The Fountain, AN ALLEGORY. 1827. In a wild scene, before unknown, I stood. Tall mountains on each hand Reared to the sky their summits lone; The vale between lay soft and bland As summer flowers and birds and rills Could make it. Streamed from 'twixt two hills, The western sun's refulgence fell, With yellow gush, along the dell. Full in the beam a crag there sprung, With blooming heath empurpled o'er, And at its base a Fountain flung Its stainless waters upâto lave The mountain flowers, that on its wave Hung bending from the pebbled shore. Few moments had I gazed, when, lo! High on that crag in robe of snow, With folded wings, whose azure far Surpassed the blue of the western sky When Spring's new moon peeps there, and the star Of love hangs, in its beauty, byâ His hair like gathered sunbeams, stood A radiant Being.âFlesh and blood Were never wrought into a form So fine and so aÃ«rial; ne'er Has Fancy imaged aught so fair. His foot was on the rock, not air; And yet it seemed the Figure there Might tread, at will, the storm! With gesture such as Romans bold Saw in their orators of old, I marked him back his mantle fling, And call, as if to crowds below, To come and quaff of that pure springâ A balm, he said, for every woe. And as he spokeâunseen till thenâ I saw with wonder all the glen Peopled with human beings,âmen, Women, and children, old and young,â Of every hue and every climeâ All pressing towards the Form sublime, And eager all to hear Tones such as mortal ear Had never heard before from any Muse's tongue. âMen! men!ââ('twas thus he cried, though much my song His incommunicable pathos wrong)â âWhat is your life? Yon cloud behold, Just o'er the southern mountain rolledâ Whence comes it? Can the wisest tell? See how it sails above the dell, Sun-gilt and softâbut soon to meet The next hill-top on breezes fleet, And vanishing behind it, goâ Whither? The wisest nothing know. Such is your life!âOf sordid birth, Sprung from, and, lastly, mixed with earth, A space ye feel existenceâsee Hour following hour in gloom or gleeâ Eat, drink, toil, slumber onâor mark The stars which nightly gem the dark, As if to mock you with the dream Of worlds that ne'er for you must gleam!â But whence ye came, or wherefore born To wealth or want, to power or scorn; Or what is hid behind the shroudâ Whether, when closed your mortal doom, Your souls shall live beyond the tomb, Ye know no more than of the cloud! A blank before, a blank beyond Your beingâthat your hearts despond, What wonder? But a Power Unknown, Commissioned from whose searchless throne, I standâa Fount hath opened here, Of virtue all the dark to clear, And show your life, with ills perplexed, But the dim passage to the nextâ A bright and blessed existence, far Above earth's tumult, toil, and war. For all who faint, for all who thirst, These waters in the desert burst; And whosoe'er, with spirit meek And lowly, shall this Fountain seek, To him the precious draught shall be The draught of Immortality!â These words pronounced, the Vision bright Like erring sunbeam glanced from sight. There was a rush among the crowdâ I saw the old gray-headed Man, Whom time and care and grief had bowed Almost to earth, with visage wan, Reach the pure spring, where, having drunk, He kneeling on the margin sunk, His hands in prayer uplifted highâ While on his face and in his eye Were gleams of bliss that cannot die! âI saw the Boy of sunny hair, Of rosy cheek, and snowy brow, And eye that ever laughedâtill nowâ Stoop to the wave with serious air, Then turn, with all the rapture given By that pure draught, his face to Heavenâ And ne'er may Passion's after trace That moment's feeling dim or rase! âI saw the Young Man who had tried Each pleasure reaped in vicious course, But who in every pleasure sighed To miss that somethiny still denied, And find but painâregretâremorse. He drank, he quaffedâno midnight bowl Had ever so entranced his soul! âI saw the Maiden, fair and pure As mortal maid may ever be, Bendâsweetly, timidly demureâ And taste the wave on grateful knee; Then render up to Heaven that prayer Which Heaven loves well to hearâ The prayer of a maiden young and fair Who has baffled each art, and broken each snare By the Tempter planted near. Next came a Youth. His forehead high, And the proud sparkle of his eye, Bespoke a haughty mind and strong, Yet one that, misdirected still, Knew much of good, but more of ill, And careless whether right or wrong The path he took, so he advanced. Deep scorn was from his gray eye glanced, Deep scorn his young lip curled; For he had studied much, and weighed The maxims which the world obeyed, And laughed at them, and at the world! Told of the spring, he came to scan What new deceit was palmed on man. He tastedâit was water pure; But, for its virtue, he was sure The common stream that threads the dell Would make Immortals quite as well! And loud he laughed in men to see So much of blind credulity. The wise, the good, the aged came Around, to pity, plead, or blame. 'Twas vain. Their feelings high he gave To self-delusionânot the wave. The heaven-sent vision and the call, To Phrensy he imputed all. 'Twas Phrensy's wild imaginings That from the sky had furnished wings, Robes from some passing vapour white, And ringlets from the sunset bright;â Or, failing these, some juggle, planned For end unknown by cunning hand, Had made them all (nor great the feat) The willing dupes of his deceit. âFor me,â he added, âI departâ And when dull head and saddened heart Bid me for knowledge seek and bliss, I'll drink at other Fount than this!â Scornful he turned away.âTo see Where next the Stripling's path would be, Curious. I joined his side, And strange I felt it was, to note His visageâay, his very thought, Myself all unespied; And stranger yet, to see an Hour Effect of Years the changing power, And gathered in one moment brief A month's adventure, guilt, and grief. Her crimson curtains Eve had drawnâ With him I crossed a fairy lawn, And reached a woodbine bower; There half reclined on mossy seat A Ladyânought so fair, so sweet, Was near in bud or flower! But such allusions, stale and weak, Of Beauty's magic force to speak, Have notâand cannot haveâthe power. Ah! though to paint the charm sublime Of Beauty in her sinless time They failâof Beauty fall'n and scorned, Their fragile tints, their blight unmourned, Present us emblems all too just! âI saw that Lady free from stain, And happy in her love. Again I looked, and saw her tears like rain Watering her lover's feetâin vainâ As knelt she suppliant in the dust! He left herâbut there shot a pang Across his brain! He clasps his browâ O what his self-abhorrence now Shall soothe or soften?âHark! there rang The revellers's shout from yonder Tower, And Mirth shall charm this moody hour. âHe entered. bright the torches beamed; The blood-red wine, from goblets streamed, Had fired each Bacchanal, and long And loud applauses claimed the song. The song arose. 'Twas such as Moore Might from his lyre of witchery pourâ The future and the past it sung As dreams to which man's weakness clung, In one gay present life compressed, And bade himââRiot and be blest!â The fancy, weak and wrong at once, Yet gained from every breast response, But waked in none around the board A readier or a louder chord Than in that Youth's. His spirit sad, Like some lone spring no sunbeams glad, Had darkened lain; no more abashed, It rose, it sparkled, and it flashed, Amid the hall's nocturnal day, In wit, in humour, and in lay! High waxed the glee; and forth the while From distance gleamed the frequent smile Of faces fairâand sylph-like shapes Would nearer steal, and, having charmed Some eye, would start, as if alarmed, And make, like fawns, their eoy escapes. Then was the reign of Lustâfor shame It were to give it fairer name; Then green-eyed Jealousy, and then His brother Hate began To agitate the minds of men; Then Rage, like tiger from his den, Rushed rudely through the mingled crowd; Then eyes grew fiery, words grew loud, And weapons bare flashed back the glare Of the hall's lights, and everywhere The blood of madmen ran. The place which lately seemed to be The home of rapture and of glee, Where Music poured her sweetest flood, Was now a scene of blows and blood! Retiring thence in deep disgust, Exclaimed the Stripling sick at heartâ âThat priestly saw, alas! how just, Which says of Revelry and Lust, Their end isâDeath!â With speed of dart, He fled; nor stopped, till distant far From that wild scene of midnight war. âOn lawn and grove a calm there lay, A calm denied to feverish day. Far in the west, to vanish soon, Hung low and dim the weary moon; But all above, innumerous sprinkled, The cloudless stars in glory twinkled. Their holy beauty touched his breast, And thus his tongue its power confessed: âAy, there ye shine! Whatever jars A world of madmen madly keep, A peace is yours, resplendent stars! Eternal, awful, dread, and deep. A calm, which yet with mightier power Than that of wordsâunless they were Composed of star-beams, and could bear From his divine, unseen abode The very thoughts themselves of God!â Proclaims to man, in such an hour, That, far retired your orbs behind, An unimaginable Mind, Invisible, though throned in light, Upholds this awful state of Night! O why retired?âO! if in me A spirit lives, derived from thee, And, like thee, deathlessâwherefore leave That soul in endless doubt to grieve? Why not, descending from above, Thy Glory softened down by Love, Away the mists of error roll, And flash the Truth upon my soulâ The glorious truth, if truth it be, That man shall live eternally? âIn vain I question, vainly try Into the future's gloom to pry. The baseless hopes, the glimpses faint Of ancient sage or modern saint No light impart; and Thouâsitt'st lone And silent on thy sullen throne!â âBeware!â I whispered, and the word Within his spirit's depth was heard, And seemed to him a thought there sprung To blame the rashness of his tongue, A check by watchful Conscience givenâ That Monitor to man from heaven. âBeware of Blasphemy! nor urge One thought to its tremendous verge! No tyrant he; nor, though so high, Does he from man avert his eye. Has he not oped a Fountain free, Invited allâinvited thee To come and drink; and, drinking, learn Whate'er it boots thee to discern? Goâtaste and live! thy school-taught pride And high-flown notions thrown aside.â âDreams!â cried the Youth, as if replying To his own heartââDreams which, decrying Man's mighty powers, would level all To those of reptiles. Shall I crawl To Falsehood's shrine, and there lay down My witâmy wisdomâmy renownâ The wild renown that ever gathers Around his name who hath avowed Opinions different from the crowd, Who dares to think above his fathers? Shall I sail down Life's common river With all the dully pious? Never!â Morn came. I marked a pageant fairâ The sound of bells was abroad in the air. A lovely Maid, in her beauty's bloom, Walked by the side of her gay Bridegroom; And wild flowers, gathered from mountain and strath, Were strewed by fair girls in the young Bride's path. It passed away; and I saw till that bride The happiest of mothers becameâand eyed With looks of deep love and maternal joy The babe on her bosomâa bright-haired Boy! I saw till he grew, and with prattling tongue Could lisp their names that over him hung With the love that, increasing day by day, Clasps all the heart in its blissful sway, Still intertwisting the fibres there With tiesâwhich to sever is Woe and Despair! Grief follows joy. The marriage bell Soon changes to the funeral knell. The flowers that wreathed the bridegroom's head, Are wanted soon to grace the dead! âThat Boyâthe object of more love Than aught below or aught above, Alas the pity!âdied. I saw Death o'er his eye's blue softness draw The darkening film; take every streak Of rose-hue from his dimpled cheek; And yet life's tint on the sweet lips spare, And the glossy shine of the sunny hair. I saw him laid in the wormy bed, And I marked the tears which fell, As the dull earth slid on his coffin lid With an echo like a knell. And the pangs that tore each parent's breast, As they left the spot of their sweet Boy's rest I sawâbut cannot tell! The grave which closed above his child, To that sad Father dimmed the worldâ No more with hope or joy he smiled; Deep scorn no more his proud lip curled. His joy was fled, his hope was dead, And for his scorn,âO! what has he To do with scorn, who sits forlorn In the dark night of misery? Where shall he turn to be consoled? Consoled? Ah never!âbut resigned? Can science to his eye unfold The truth which heals the wounded mind? Can all the store of classic lore 'Vail him from whom e'en Pride has parted? Or early Fame the strong spell frame To re-exalt the broken-hearted? He could not bear to think the earth Held all his Boy! whose face of mirthâ Whose playful artsâwhose winning waysâ Whose tears at blameâwhose pride at praiseâ Whose flying hair, and radiant brow Wereâas in lifeâbefore him now! That sparkling eye where, as he deemed, The light of early genius beamedâ Had death for ever quenched its ray? And could that genius pass away? The form, a flower of mortal birth, Might fitly turn again to earth; But could the spiritâfor he felt Some principle within him dwelt Above mere matterâcould it pass, Like meteor of the dark morass? âO noâit lives! it lives!â he cried In transport. Then he paused and sighed. The thought, he found, was balm to grief, But it was hope, and not belief. âO! worlds on worlds, if these were mine, I would, without a sigh, resign To him who should assure my heart That still, my child, thou artâthou art! That where thou liv'st thy sire may soarâ With thee resideâwith thee adoreâ In a fair land where death nor pain Shall reach my bright-haired Boy again!â This was my time, and Heaven's!âI gave A hint of the all-healing wave. My whispers to his ear conveyed The words the Shining Form had saidâ âFor all who faint, for all who thirst, These waters in the desert burst; And whosoe'er, with spirit meek And lowly, shall this Fountain seek, To him the precious draught shall be The draught of Immortality!â He started. At his inmost soul He felt the offer's pointed kindness; No longer swayed by Pride's controul, And feeling now his weaknessâblindnessâ Heart-bruised, and humbledâall his mind Was bent the Wondrous Fount to find. The evening sun was shining Upon that rock again; And flowers, as erst, were lining The Fount that knew no stain; And crowds, of its pure wave to drink, Were pressing still around the brink; When he its verdant margin won, That Father of a buried son. He kneeled him down to drink, but ere He tasted, raised his eyes in prayerâ âHigh Dweller of Eternity! Unseen, though round usâhear me! hear! I've asked the Sun to tell of thee: He answered, from his burning sphere, âA glorious being made meâbrightâ A system's centre and its light, Whence an exhaustless day is hurled From zone to zone of every world!â âI've asked the Earth, the Ocean: this, In thunder from his vast abyss, Bade me the Mighty Hand remark That must have scooped his dwellings dark! Earth spoke of it from hill and flood From peopled vale and sounding wood! âI've asked the Heavens: their mute reply Was glanced from every star on high, âThere is a God!â Orion cried; âA God!â the Pleiades replied; The Moon announced it as she rode, The west's fair planet beamedââA God!â âI knew thou art, and, knowing so, Felt more was wanting than to know; The Maker, all things else above, Ought to possess the creature's love. I tried to love thee; but my breast, Unmoved, retained its marble rest. I tried to pray; my prayers, alas! Returned as from a sky of brass. In books I sought the food to find Suited to my life-grasping mind; Unfounded hopes! conjectures bold! Despair was all they taught or told. âAt last, great Power! my reasoning pride As vain and worthless cast asideâ Erringâand blindâand brokenâsee! At this pure Fount I bend to thee. And that it is indeed the sole Spring, which can make the wounded wholeâ Render the eye-sight strong to scan The hidden destiny of manâ See, at the close of this world's strife, The brilliant dawn of endless lifeâ I, who have, in my depth of grief, Found worthless every spring beside, Would fain believe,âO Heavenly Guide Pardon and help my unbelief!â This said, he drankâhe drank! and O! The change his altering features show. The cloud of sorrow and despair Hath passedâno more to darken there! His eye, lit up by holiest faith, Pierces the darksome veil of death, Sees his lost child, a Seraph bright, Wandering among the bowers of light; And tears are gushing down his cheeks, But every tear of rapture speaks! The Poet's Home. 1828. [On taking possession of a new house in Gargrave.] Scaped from a Hut, much too poetic, Where, plying still his art mimctic, Sir Spider sits, and looking after His prey, hangs webs from wall to rafterâ Where he and I, with like enjoyment, Pursued a similar employment, That is, both lurked, with few to see us, He to catch flies, and I ideas, Which, caught, (to bear the semblance further) From bard and insect suffered murther. â'Scaped from that House to one much neater, Much loftier, roomier, and completer, (Heaven grant my Landlord cent. per cent. If he will not enlarge my rent!) I sitâa reeking glass before meâ A family round that half adore meâ And number up, with mind at ease, The items of my premises. And, first, I have a houseâto hitch in A rhyme, 'twere better styled a kitchenâ Where in my week-day dress I sit, Laugh at my wife, and show my wit. The walls yet sparkle to my lampâ May heaven protect us from the damp! But if it must destroy one life, Suppose, just now, it take my wife. Well, free again! I chat and rove With Beauty in the moonlight grove, Till my heart dances to the tune Sweet of a second Honey Moon. 'Tis a most pleasant thought!âBut stay; Suppose it just the other wayâ Suppose it spares my loving wife, And takes her loving husband's life, And, further, that another swain Assumes the matrimonial rein, And drives the team I drive at presentâ By Jove! this thought is not so pleasant. I have a scullery, where, each Monday That comes to sweep the dirt of Sunday, Finds Ellen, not in best of moods, Plashing among her frothing suds, While cock or spigot hourly squirts The water for the Poet's shirts. I have a cellarânot a deep one, But yet of depth enough to keep one A cask or two of gin, or whisky, Which rhymes to what it makes usâfrisky. My Parlour next the verse demands. A portrait o'er the chimney stands, But whose? Why mineâby country artist Ta'en when the Bard was at the smartest, That is, when in his wedding dressâ And if these tints his face express, By PhÅbus' head! I cannot think The bard is any common drink. There's a calm sparkle in the eye, That speaks somewhat of dignity; A musing lip; a whisker tight; A forehead not amiss for height. It lacks in breadthâbut this is stuff; For I have witnessed oft enough A broader and a loftier sconce O'ertop the eyebrows of a dunce. But I digress. For one or two, My parlour, though but small, will do; Especially when Ellen's hand Sets on the board the spirit-stand, Each bright decanter filled with liquor, To toast my Landlord and the Vicar; Or, if a loyal mood it bring, Old England's patriotic King. Now, reader, walk up stairsâbut hope Thou not the first-seen door to ope. The next expand. My girls in this Dream every night their dreams of bliss, These snowy curtains round them spreadâ Two fairies in a fairy bed! The third and last, whichâhalf in jest In earnest halfâwe style the best, Serves but the hospitable end, To lodge a stranger or a friend. Did Mitchell Mitchellâeditor of the Newcastle Magazine. leave the Tyne's fair side, Or Gourley Gourleyâmaster of the Corporation School, Morpeth. from the Wansbeck ride, Or Hall, Hallâthe dissenting-minister of Crookham.âAll good-hearted men, and all now under the turf. with eloquence at will, Come from the borders of the Till,â This chamber should receive, and steep Their senses in delicious sleep! I have a gardenâ'tis but smallâ Surrounded by a six-feet wall: Its walks full trim with box and gravel, On which the nicest foot might travel. 'Tis dark and bareâbut come in Spring, These elms shall then no shadow fling! These walls with blossom clothed shall be By many an autumn-planted tree; While many a garden flower smiles by, To lure the bee and butterfly! Such my new Residence; and yet It was with something like regret I left the old one!âThere, I've been For years contented and serene; There bloomed my girlsâthe damps it shed Ne'er turned to pale their cherub red; And there my rapt and musing eye, Touched by thy glamour, Poesy! Hath ta'en its rude and ochre'd wall For one belonging princely hall, And every cobweb's waving fold For cloth of silver or of gold! Yes! it is certain, that the bard To house or hall pays light regard. Where'er he dwellethâbe his roof Pervious to storm or tempest-proofâ There throng the shapes his magic raised, There bend the forms his songs have praised, Unseen by all but him, they come, Brighten his light, or gild his gloomâ And, blest with these, the same his lot, Whether in Castle or in Cot! There's a Dark Hour Coming. 1828. [Reflecting on the fate of poor John S?, of Humbleton. His love was a Miss H?, of Wooler, and to her I conceived he might have thus addressed himself.] There's a dark hour coming, Which thou, so kind and dear, In all thy beauty blooming, Shalt fail to charm or cheer! The shade it casts before it, Its very shade is drearâ And my soul as it comes o'er it, Feels a deep, prophetic fear! There's a dark hour coming! The honour oft applauded, The heart all truth to thee, The genius men have lauded Will soon be lost in me. A star at once o'erclouded, Whose beam was fair to seeâ The sun in darkness shroudedâ O! nought can emblem be Of the dark hour coming! Its charm when friendship loses, When love is felt no more; When glory and the Muses Have seen their influence o'er; When I view with hate or terror The friends I loved before, When my laugh they hear with horror Andâunthankedâmy state deplore,â O! that dark hour's coming! One April Morn. 1828. [Roddam Dean was the âvalleyâânot properly so calledâthat âbloomed before me.â] One April morn I musing lay, My eyelids closed withoutmy knowingâ Above me was a sky-lark gay, Beside me was a streamlet flowing. That bird seemed just the very bird In mine own land that caroled o'er me! That streamlet's voice the same I heard When one sweet valley bloomed before me. I startedâto my feet I sprung As if to find my former world; â'Twas but a Craven bird that sung, 'Twas but a Craven stream that purled! Reply to an Epistle from Mr. Gourley. 1828. [Mr. Gourley, already mentioned in a note, was a self-taught mathematician, and a thirty years' intimate friend and correspondent of mine.] Dear sir, Your favour reached me duly, For which, of course, I thank you truly, And now address me to the task Of answering all you kindly ask. âHow are you?â Well. âAnd how your wife?â Never was better in her life. âThank God! But for another query, Your childern how?â Alive and merry. âProlonged be every pure enjoyment! And now, what is the Bard's employment? Spends he his time, as usual, gaily? Or, settled to a plodder daily, Centres his every scheme in self, His only object grasping pelf? Is Poesy his loved pursuit? And if so, when will come the Fruit? The Blossoms A small collection of poems entiled âCraven Blossomsâ lived a single day Then passedâlike other flowersâaway. Say, will the Fruit, when gathered, cheer Our banquets for at least a year? How stand your politics? I know it, The politics of genuine poet May with propriety be ta'en Rather as light whims of the brain, Than principles by labour wrought From the deep mine of solid Thought. But do you stand a red-hot tory? Or, floating with the tide, will Story Seek (to adopt the day's expression) The calmer harbour of concession? Your thoughts, opinions, freely state 'em. Then, here they follow seriatim. First, of employment I've enough, Of avocations quantum suff. Like Goldsmith's juggler, when one trick Begins to make the public sick, I'm able from my treasured store, To try them with a hundred more. And sooth to tell without dissembling, I sometimes see with fear and trembling The likelihood, in spite of all My hundred tricks, of sudden fall; And envy, in my dread of failure, The destiny of common Tailor! You long have known me âskilled to rule,â As master of a village school. A useful post, but thankless stillâ Of which the ancients thought so ill, They held the man to whom 'twas given, An object of the wrath of heaven. âBy fools beset, by idiots judged, His pains despised, his payments grudged, Rivalled by things whom juster doom Had placed in farm-yard or at loom, (For 'tis as true as parsons preach That men who ne'er were taught, can teach!) Hard is his lot, to own the truth, Condemned to train our rising youth. Yet even in this picture dark The eye some streaks of light may markâ The common mob, whose grovelling nature Would for Hyperion choose a Satyr, By loftier mind or station awed, Will sometimes properly applaud, Following, like sheep, the judging fewâ And lucky Merit gets his due. Learn, next, that I am Parish Clerkâ A noble office, by St. Mark! It brings me in six guineas clear, Besides et ceteras, every year. I waive my Sunday duty, when I give the solemn, deep Amen, Exalted there to breathe aloud The heart-devotion of the crowd. But O the fun! when Christmas-chimes Have ushered in the festal times, And sent the Clerk and Sexton round To pledge their friends in draughts profound, And keep on foot the good old plan, As only Clerk and Sexton can! Nor less the sport, when Easter sees; The daisy spring to deck the leas; Then, claimed as dues by Mother Church, I pluck the cackler from the perch; Or, in its place, the shilling clasp From grumbling Dame's slow-opening grasp. But, Visitation-day! 'tis thine Best to deserve my votive lineâ Great Day! the purest, brightest gem That decks the Year's fair diadem! Grand Day! that sees me costless dine, And costless quaff the rosy wine, Till seven Church wardens doubled seem, And doubled every candle's gleam, And Iâtriumphant over time, And over tune, and over rhymeâ Called by the gay, convivial throng, Lead, in full glee, the choral song! âI love thee, brandy, on my soul; And, rum, thou'rt precious in the bowl; Whisky is dear, because it tells Of the bright dew of Scottish fells; But nought commands the poet's praise Like wineâfor which the Parish pays! For Songâ'tis still my loved pursuit, And you shall soon possess the Fruit. But whether it will keep, to cheer Your banquets for a month, or year, Let time decideâor sages pure That sentence give on literature. âCritics in every age have tried The endless question to decide Of âWhat is Poetry?â and still It busies many a learnÃ¨d quill. Poets themselves, seduced to quit Their high and native walks of wit, Have stooped to cramp and to confine, In school-taught terms, their Art Divine,â When they had best performed their part, And honoured most their glorious art, By pointing out some passage, fraught With Taste, with Genuis, and with Thought, Where heart, and soul, and fancy give Their mingling hues to glow and liveâ And saying: âFind who will the why, But this, we feel, is Poetry.â Thus I, who little heed the rules By critics made for rhyming fools, Have formed, though o'er my second bottle, As sure a test as Aristotleâ Read Shakspeare's glowing page to see What is undoubted poetry; And then this paragraph, God wot, If you would seeâwhat it is not. My Harp was made from stunted tree, The growth of Glendale's barest lea; Yet fresh as prouder stems it grew, And drank, with leaf as green, the dew; Bright showers, from Till or Beaumont shed, Its roots with needful moisture fed; Gay birds, Northumbrian skies that wing, Amid its branches loved to sing; And purple Cheviot's breezy air Kept up a life-like quivering there. From Harp thence framed, and rudely strung, Can aught but lowly strain be flung? No! if, ambition-led, I dream Of striking it to lofty theme, All harshly jar its tortured chords As plaining such should be its lord's; But all its sweetness waketh still To lay of Border stream or hill! To Craven's emerald dales transferred, That simple Harp with praise is heard. The manliest sons, the loveliest daughters That flourish by the Aire's young waters, By hurrying Ribble's verdant side, And by the Wharf's impetuous tide, Laud its wild strains. And, for this cause, While throbs my breast to kind applauseâ Nay, when, beneath the turf laid low, No kind applause my breast can know, The Poet's blessing, heart-bequeathed, O'er thy domains, green Craven! breathed, Shall be to every hill and plain Like vernal dew, or summer rain, And stay with thee, while bud or bell Decks lowland mead or upland fell! Thus have I scribbled on, my friend, Till Ellen hints 'tis time to end; My nails worn to the quick with gnawing, My caput sore withâwithâwithâclawing. (What words we bards are forced, at times, To press into the corps of rhymes!) My conscience, how the quizzer laughs! During the last two paragraphs, These symptoms, as poetic known, She says have quite outrageous grown; And threatens or to quench my taper, O'erturn my ink, or burn my paper. So to prevent these doings rude. I think it better to conclude, And aught unanswered or perplexed, To clear and answer in my next. Meantime I wish you PeaceâLoveâGlory! And am Yours ever, ROBERT STORY. Twenty Years Parted 1828. [My father, in his grave, is supposed to address my motherâjust laid beside him.] Twenty years parted, Though forty years tried, And found still true-heartedâ Return to my side! And quiet and deep Shall be thy long sleep Where the heart is at rest, and the tear is dried! From trials and woes That so long have been thine, Come, taste the repose Which the grave hath made mineâ And quiet and deep Shall be thy long sleep Where no blast ever comes, if no sunbeam shine! With want, one long strife 'Twas our lot to maintain, Till we quitted a life Undisgraced by a stain; But quiet and deep Shall be our long sleep, Till the last Morn's dawn see us wake again! Breathe, Breathe on my Heart. 1829. [On revisiting Roddam Dean.] âBreathe, breathe on my heart, O breathe on my heart, Ye flowers of a valley so loved of yore! I come but to gazeâbut to gaze and depart, And I ask ye the pulse of my youth to restore! For my heart is so languid, so weary, so low, So dry, and so withered!âBut breathe, as ye blow, Your beauty into itâcoolâdewyâand O! It will waken to all its old feelings once more. âBreathe, breathe on my heart, sweet crow-flower, breathe, As thou streakest the turf with the gold of thy bloom! And ye, purple blossoms, that gem the dark heath, O freshen my soul with your mountain perfume! The primrose hath vanished; the violet too, Hath passed from the walk with its leaflets of blue; And of all the gay blossoms of broomwood, but few Remain with their light in the glen's verdant gloom. âYet breathe on my heart, ye lingerers, breathe! Ye have rapture within your moist foldings for me! And thou, stately fox-glove, thyself a bright wreath Of blossoms the loveliest, I call upon thee; From thy string of sweet bellsâa most fairy like stringâ The soft, silent music of beauty O fling! It will enter my heart like a song in the springâ The first that is poured from the fresh-budding tree! âBreathe, breathe on my heart, wild thyme of the hill, That lovest to bloom on the verge of the glen! Breathe, every sweet floweret befringing the rill, Or namelessly starring the green of the fen! But chiefly, ye roses, profusely that flaunt, Ye woodbines, that welcome me back to my haunt, The charm and the perfume of other years grantâ O breathe on my heart as ye breathed on it then!â I stood, as I spoke, on the brow of the dell, Where oft I had loitered in long-vanished years; And here waved the forest, and there rose the fell, Which the songs of my youth had described without peers! The flowers I apostrophised, over me cast The sweets they had shed in the bright summers past, And, o'ercome by the reflux of feeling at last, I sank on the turf, and bedewed it with tears! The Dead stood by. 1830. The âtwo youthful friendsâ in the following stanzas, were William Thompson, a fellow-reaper in the fields of Roddam, and John Smith, of Humbleton. The âlovely visionâ was Jeanie Kennedy, of Reveley, on the Breamish.] The Dead stood by my couch last night! (The living of another sphere!) And my raised spirit, at the sight, Felt much of awe, but nought of fear; For though, e'en in my dream, I knew Immortal Forms bent o'er my bed, They were so like themselves! the trueâ The fairâthe reverenced!âCould I dread? So like themselves! and yet they had A look they wore not when aliveâ It was not stern, it was not sad, Though sternness seemed with grief to strive. It was a mournful seriousnessâ A pity graveâmost like the air Which, when compassion they express, We deem an Angel's eyes may wear! A tall old man stood next my faceâ Well in his thin, dark, furrowed cheek, And forehead mild, my soul could trace The features loved in childhood weak. I thought on the paternal cotâ The circle round its evening flameâ And my lips moved, but murmured notâ I could not speak my Father's name! Two youthful Friends beside him stood, Whom early death had snatched away; The oneâof those who, humbly good, Seek the mild virtues to display. He moved in no eccentric course, Allured by Passion or by Pride; He knew no vice, felt no remorse, But meekly lived, and calmly died. The otherâO how different He! Him Genius cherished as a son; Th' unfading wreath of Poesy He looked on as already won. Through untried regions plumed to range, His Muse had just essayed to fly, When he exchangedâa great exchange!â Glory on earth, for Bliss on high. A once-loved Form stood next and last, A lovely visionâpureâand stillâ Whose living charms had all surpassed That bloom by Breamish or by Till. She seemed no fairer than of old,â But then there was a fixedness Of beauty on her cheek, that told It never could be moreâor less! My very heart within me yearned To see these visitants divine; Nor was it long before I learned Their spirits held discourse with mine! There was no word, or turn of eye; Upon my ear no music stole; But yet there was communion highâ The silent talk of soul with soul! My past career they marked with blame, Its thoughtless faults, its deeper crimes; They bade me quit the race of Fame, And run for nobler prize than Time's. âThe fame,â they said, âby man bestowed, Fills not the high, immortal soul; The glorious wreath conferred by God, Shall bloomâwhen Earth has ceased to roll! âDeath is at handâthat throwing down Of barriers which the soul confineâ When the pure heart shall gain a crown: Why not that heavenly crown be thine? By prayerâby prayerâunfile thy heart, And join us in eternity!â For O! retain this truthâThou art, And never canst thou cease to be!â These words form the moral of âThe Pelican Islandââthe finest of all the fine poems of James Montgomery. âThou art, and thou canst never cease to be!â O Woman, Fair Woman. 1830. O woman, fair Woman, thou breakest on man As the dawn of a bright summer day Shines forth on a vapour uncoloured and wan, And kindles it up by its rayâ Till, quite metamorphosed, it rests in the sky, A radiant and purified thingâ And meet, as it seemeth to Fancy's bold eye, An Angel to lure from the wing! O Woman, fair Woman, thou breakest on man, Like that summer dawn beaming above, And man is that vapour uncoloured and wan, Till touched and illumed by the love. Then, changed and enkindled, he glows in thine eye, From all that degraded him freeâ High-thoughted, and pure as the cloud in the sky, Yet wishing no Angel but Thee! It is Sweet to Perceive. 1831. [Written in anticipation of a Reform Bill.] It is sweet to perceive the first efforts of Spring; To watch the buds tenderly, timidly ope; To feel at one's heart the pure freshness they bring, Till the languid heart leaps to the promise of Hope! Of spring talks yon blue sky, of spring this green land, Of spring the gay warblings these valleys that fillâ Sweet proof that the Mighty Artificer's hand Impels the machine of the universe still! God! dost thou not rule in the armies of heaven? Thy impulse the stars in their courses obey; The lightnings themselves, when the dark cloud is riven, Flash fate as thou biddest, or harmlessly play! And hast thou relinquished the curb and control Of man? Hath thy government ceased from the world? Then whence this unquietness, madness of soul? And why are those ensigns of battle unfurled? O! with the strong voice that can still the wild sea, Speak peace to the hearts and the passions of men! With the power that hath bidden the winter-clouds flee, Let the sunshine of joy gild their dwellings again! And with the soft breath that awakens the spring, Breathe over the mind of the nations, O Lord! That genuine freedom which comes not from king, Nor is won, or destroyed, by the conqueror's sword! But if, for some purpose inscrutable, Thou Wilt see over Europe wild Anarchy burst, O! let not my country her honoured neck bow To the yoke of that Despotâthe vilestâthe worst! Give wisdom to guard our old strengths that have stood The beatings of time, as her rocks the rude sea, And Albion shall ever o'erlook the blue flood, The first of the nationsâthe Isle of the Free! O! Blest is the Hearth. 1832. O blest is the hearth, and delightful the home Where Honour and Virtue preside; Where the Husband's as kind as the youthful Bridegroom, And the Wife is as fond as the Bride! Though the bloom may be fading that lived on her cheek, And the fire of his glance may be colder, The mind still is there, true affection to speak, And the mind never grows any older! The few Corn-fields. 1832. [These lines were addressed to Margarct, or, as I liked better to call her, Peggy Richardson, a young and pretty girl of Calder, on the Roddam estate, with whom I reaped more than one harvest, and who was the heroine of a juvenile poem of mine.] The few corn-fields that Craven sees Like patches on her landscape green, Wave yellow now in sun and breeze, Inviting out the sickle keen. But who the sickle bears afield? I see no fair and youthful band, The peaceful weapon prompt to wield, And clearâwith mirthâthe waving land. A single reaperâ(past belief!) Plies awkwardly his lonely toil; He makes the band, he binds the sheaf, And rears the shockâwithout a smile! Yet e'en this sight of single field And single reaper, brings to me A mood to which I like to yieldâ A dream of Roddam fields and thee! On Roddam's harvest-land, who now Bid the hot day unheeded fly? Is there a Maiden fair as thou? Is there a Lover fond as I? Dost recollectâwhen, side by side, 'Twas ours to lead the jovial bandâ With what delight, and heart-felt pride, I saw thee grace my dexter hand! Dost recollectâ'mid sickles' jarâ How rang, at jests, the laughter-chorus? Our line, the while, extending far, And driving half a field before us! Dost recollect, at resting-time, Announced by Roddam's village clock, (Methinks e'en now I hear the chime!) The squeeze beside the yellow shock? Dost recollect, when evening came, The dance got up with ready glee? How active grew each wearied frame! How lightly then I danced with thee! Dost recollectâwhen half asleep Thy mother and thy grumbling sireâ The pleasant watch we used to keep For hours beside the smothered fire? For e'en the fair Moon's radiance pure, That trembled through the window blue, Along the cottage furniture Too strong a lightâfor loversâthrew! But where art thou? and where am I? And Roddam's corn-fields, where are they? Ah! where the days when thou wert nigh, The rainbow of my darkest day? For fair thou wert; though ne'er, perchance, So fair as my young fancy drew thee;â I see, e'en yet, the roguish glance That linked my captive heart unto thee! And when I think of thee, I scarce Can think of thee as differing aught From her who once inspired my verseâ Though in myself a change is wrought. The reaper's part that once I bore Untired, I could not bear again; And did thy sire make fast the door, I could not enter at the pans! The toilsome day would slowly pass; Reflection nought could bring but woe; And for the evening dance, alas! One Scottish reel would make me blow. Suppose us met in Roddam fieldâ I verging towards my fortieth year, And thou not far behindâto wield, As once we did, the sickle clear; We could not chose but laughâor weep; The last would be my first employment, To feel emotionsâlong asleepâ Re-wakening but to past enjoyment! Is that the hand I loved to grasp! Thine cannot be that cheek so wan! Nor thine that waist! I used to clasp A waist that my two hands could span! Alas! the truth we might have known, But would not, flashes on us nowâ That youth must fly; for it hath flown, And ceased to love have I and thou! On Roddam fields another race The part we took of old, have ta'en; They toilâor toyâin each dear place That ne'er shall meet our glance again! Thus when a boy on Beaumont Side, (A scene that is not strange to thee) I saw the heath-bloom in its pride Bend to the kiss of mountain bee: And bees and blooms, no doubt, are rife By Beaumont still; but neverâneverâ Shall those I saw in early life Be seen again by that sweet river! âWell; time does but to us award The fate by millions felt before; And I am Roddam's youthful bard, Thou Calder's fairest flower no more! Again the Sweetest Season. 1832. Again the sweetest season wakes, Again the bud is on the treeâ A sight, my Ellen, which it makes Me pleased and sad at once, to see. âI feel the joy which Nature feels, As in my youth's departed prime; I feelâwhat every shrub revealsâ The tender beauty of the time. âBut ah! to thinkâwhile Nature keeps All unimpaired her mighty power, Clothing as richly plains and steeps As in the earth's primeval hourâ âTo think that I, if natural length Of years withhold me from the urn, With feebler pulse and waning strength, Must hail each future spring's return! âTo think that, laid at last in clay, No more for me shall earth be clad In all the young spring's fresh arrayâ My spirit sinks, and I am sad!â Prompt was my Ellen's kind reply To check the low, despondent strain: âNay, for a smile exchange that sigh,â She said, âand triumph, not complain! âSpring-flowers are types of human bliss, So beautifulâso frail their forms: Nor do we name our woes amissâ The blight of frosts, the crush of storms. âOur spring-time flies with smile and song, Swift as the sun-gleam o'er the lea; But O! what words may tell the long, Dark, winter-time of misery? âFrom life's long blast 'twere very sweet To feel, with every spring that blows, We draw more near the calm retreat In which the weary find repose. âBut shall we stoop from Paynim founts To draw the solace Paynims drew? No, no! the Christain's spirit mounts, And soars above yon vault of blueâ âThere sees, in a serener clime, A fairer spring evolve its bloom, Untarnished by one touch of timeâ Unsaddened by a single tomb!â âWhere happy soulsâtheir troubles o'er, Their weariness and worldly strifeâ Bathe in the streams for evermore, Whose every swell is bliss and life! âNow, love, exult, to think, with me, Each spring but sees us nearer rise To that Land of Felicity Its beauty faintly typifies!â Wethercote Cave. 1833. [This is a remarkable fissure in a rock, rather than a cave, into which a torrent is constantly poured. I was forcibly struck with the contrast between this scene of noise and tumult, and the quiet and silence of the church and churchyard of Chapel-le-Dale, which are within a little distance of it.] This rugged descent, and this horror sublime, The gloom of these caves excavÃ ted by Time; This far fall of waters which, crushed by their fall, Are hoveringâin mistâround each moss-covered wall; The roar of their tortures, ere upward they swell Over rocks that seem tinted with colours of Hell!â And these shadows shall lour, and these waters shall rave, Till the last trumpet echoes o'er Wethercote cave! What calmer, what holier emotions prevail In the breast that beholds thee, sweet Chapel-le-Dale! And O! when I think on the struggle, the strife, The pomp, and the pride, and the nonsense of life, And know that all ends, when the turmoil is past, In the quiet and calm of the churchyard at last,â The toils of the learned, and the feats of the brave, Seem the vain noise of waters in Wethercote cave! With Bounding Step. 1833. [These lines are founded on the following fact:âSome thirty years ago two boys, sons of a gentleman in Malham, left their home in search of birds' nests. Arriving at the top of a lofty crag, called Cam Scar, the elder, an adventurous little fellow of five or six years old, descended the tremendous precipice, and having secured a hawk's nest, was returning to the summit, when, stooping to pluck a knot of cowslips, he lost his hold and fell. His brother, too young to understand what had happened, found his body at the foot of the rock, and after repeatedly shaking it, returned home, quite unconcerned. âI shook him very hard,â said he, in answer to his father's inquiries, âbut he was sound asleep.â] With bounding step, and laughing eye, Young Edgar sprang his sire to hailâ The child had rambled far and high Among the crags of Malhamdaleâ âSee, father, what a pretty wreath Of flowers;âI would their names I knew!â I found this bright one on the heath, Its golden leaves all moist with dew. âThis, father, is a primrose pale, I knew it in its hazel bowerâ But every child within the dale Knows, as I think, the primrose-flower. âO, this small bud 'twas hard to spy! Deep in a mossy cleft it grew: With nought to look at, save the sky, It seems to have imbibed its blue!â Not yet, perchance, had Edgar stayed The prattle, to a parent dear; ButââWhy,â the anxious father said, âIs Henry, with his flowers, not here?â âMy brother? O, I had forgot,â The little rosy boy replied, âI left him in the wildest spotâ Asleepâyon mighty crag beside.â âAsleep, my boy?âââYes, father. We A hawk had startled from a chink; And, on the crag's top leaving me, My brother clambered round its brink. âSoon did I hear his shout of gleeâ The nest became his instant prize; When, clambering back his way to me, A knot of cowslips caught his eyes. âHe stooped, and disappeared. Some time I stood and watched the hazel shoot, By which my brother up might climb; At last I sought the crag's green foot: âI found him lying on the sward, The grassy sward beneath the steep; I shook, and shook him very hardâ But, father, he was sound asleep.â The father shrieked the lost one's name! Young Edgar heard, and held his breath; For o'er him, with a shudder, came The thought that he had been withâDeath! He led them to the fatal spot, Where still and cold his brother lay, Within his hand the cowslip-knot That lured his heedless foot astray. That cowslip-knot shall never pour Its sweets again on summer gale, And that poor boy shall never more Climb the wild crags of Malhamdale! I know thou Lov'st me. 1834. [Written after reading some sermons by the late Dr. Adam Clark.] I know thou lov'st me, hast at heart My mortal and immortal weal; That mine hath been a thankless part, I bitterly and deeply feel. Pure was the light that filled my soul In boyhoodâfor the light was thine; But soon, too soon did Error roll Its darkness o'er the brilliant shine. In pride of heart, as manhood came, I sought me paths abhorred by thee; Forsook thy worship and thy name;â But thou hast ne'er forsaken me! My Father's God! I recollect Escapes in that abandoned time, And own and bless the hand that checked My course upon the verge of crime. Was this not for my Father's sake? For thus of old thy promise ran, That thou wouldst ne'er thy favour take From offspring of the righteous man. In bloom of being, one by one, I saw my young companions die; Thy work in me was not begunâ I was unfitted for the sky! Yet not by shock of crushing ill Spok'st thou âin thunderâ from above; To me thy Mercyâin the âstill, Small voiceâ of blessingsâwhispered love. The hand that made the heart, full well Its nature knows. Like early rain, On mine's dry soil thy goodness fell, And made it soft to bloom again! Blest in my basket and my store, Blest in my children, wife and home, I feel thou lov'st meâand no more Would I from thee perversely roam. The Isles are Awake! 1834. [These lines were first published in the Standard of December 10, 1834, and were thence transferred to the pages of every Conservative newspaper in the three kingdoms. During the General Election of 1835, they were again brought out, and again they made the tour of the periodical press. In South Lancashire, in particular, many thousand copies of them were circulated; and having been hitherto printed anonymously, they were now attributed to the Earl of Ellesmereâ (then Lord Francis Egerton)âone of the successful candidates for the representation of that district. His lordship's disclaimer of the authorship was made in a way highly gratifying to the real writer, and led to the dedication of a collection of my poems to his lordship] Hark! heard ye that sound as it passed in the gale? And saw ye not yonder Destructive turn pale? 'Twas the heart-shout of Loyalty, fervent and true, 'Twas the death-knell of Hope to himself and his crew; O waft it, ye breezes, and far let it ring, That the Isles are awake at the voice of the King! Long years have passed over, in which, with a sigh, The good man looked on as the wicked sat high; And half he forgot, in the depth of his grief, That the joy of the bad hath the date of a leaf; Thank God, it is blighted! and true men may sing, Since the Isles are awake at the voice of the King! The tide of our love never ebbs. We loved on, When the gloom of ill counsels o'ershadowed his throne; We loved, when the sun of our Monarch grew dim; We sorrowed, yet not for ourselves, but for him; And Self hath small part in the raptures that spring To see the Isles wake at the Voice of the King! He hath spoke like his fatherââThe Altar shall stand!â Which England re-echoes from mountain to strand; The dark heaths of Scotia the burden prolong, And the green dales of Erin burst out into song; For her harpies of strife and of blood have ta'en wing, And the Isles are awake at the voice of the King! The Church of our Fathers. 1835. [This lyric followed immediately on the preceding one, and was almost equally popular. See to music by Robert Guylott.] Encircled by trees, in the Sabbath's calm smile, The church of our fathersâhow meekly it stands! O villagers, gaze on the old, hallowed pileâ It was dear to their hearts, it was raised by their hands! Who loves not the place where they worshipped their God? Who loves not the ground where their ashes repose? Dear even the daisy that blooms on the sod, For dear is the dust out of which it arose! Then say, shall the church that our forefathers built, Which the tempests of ages have battered in vain, Abandoned by us from supineness or guilt, O say, shall it fall by the rash and profane? No!âPerish the impious hand that would take One shred from its altar, one stone from its towers! The life-blood of martyrs hath flowed for its sake, And its fallâif it fallâshall be reddened with ours The Bride is Away 1835. [On the marriage of Miss M?, of the vicarage, Gargrave. Set to music by Richard Limpus, Jun.] The Bride is awayâand there does not breathe one Within the glad sound of these bells, Who feels not as if with that lady were gone Some charm from the spot where he dwells; There does not breathe one but who feels at his heart Two currents of sentiment met, And who hardly knows whether the tear that would start Is the offspting of Joy or Regret! The Bride is awayâlike a bird from the bower, In which 'twas the sweetest that sung; Like a flower she hath passed, like a violet flower, That perfumed all the place where it sprung! And she charms other hearts with her bloom and her song, But though of her presence bereft, The thought of her goodness and loveliness long Will be sweet in the hearts she has left! Stop, O Stop the Passing-Bell. 1835. [I heard the passing-bell one morning. It was tolling for Mrs. Coulthurst, of Gargrave Houseâa lady respected by all. âWhat must her husband feel to hear these sounds!â I said, and wrote the lines.] Stop, O stop the passing-bell! Painfully, too painfully, It strikes against the heart, that knell; I cannot bear its tonesâthey tell Of misery, of misery! All that soothed and sweetened life In the Mother and the Wifeâ All that would a charm have cast O'er the future as the pastâ All is torturing in that knell! Stop, O stop the passing-bell. Stop itâno! But change the tone, And joyfully, ay, joyfully, Let the altered chimes ring on, For the spirit that hath flown Exultingly, exultingly! She hath left her couch of pain; She shall never feel again But as angels feelâafar Climed beyond the morning star, Agony and death unknown! Let the joyful chimes ring on! The Wives and the Mothers of Britain. 1835. [Set to music byâJohnson, of Preston, in Lancashire, andâfor private circulationâby Elias Chadwick, Esq., then of Swinton Hall. Manchester.] Let each fill his glass, fill it up to the brim, For my toast is well worthy a full one, Nor would I give much for the feelings of him Who should deem it a vapid and dull one: For him not a wine-cup deservedly foams, Whatever gay room he may sit in; I give you the Women that brighten our homesâ âThe Wives and the Mothers of Britain!â 'Tis a toast comprehensiveâit leaves no one out Whose smiles make an English hearth pleasant, From the fair cottage-matron that, rosy and stout, Delights the bold heart of the peasantâ From her to the dame of the stateliest hall Our proudest nobility sit in, And up to the Queen, who presides over all, The Wives and the Mothers of Britain! Nor will we forget the sweet rose-buds that blow Beneath the kind eye of those mothers; Whose hearts are their own, yet not long may be so, But devotedly, meekly, another's. Let us hope that their sons will be patriots true, Like those of the room that we sit in; And still be it felt there is reverence due To the Wives and the Mothers of Britain! The Wane of the Day. 1835. [This was a birth-day Song, written on completing my fortieth year. I fancied myself old!] O! the heart is not so light In the wane of the day, And the eye is not so bright In the wane of the day; The ear hath duller grown For the swell of music's tone, And the dance's charm is gone In the wane of the day! The sweet spring hath its buds In the wane of the day, Where the primrose deeks the woods In the wane of the day; The mead is flushed with gold, And the lark is on the wold, But he sings not as of oldâ In the wane of the day! Yet I have some ties to life In the wane of the day; I've a fair and frugal wife In the wane of the day; And when round my evening hearth Mix my little band in mirth, I'm the happiest man on earth In the wane of the day! The Ancient Barons. 1836. [âNolumus leges AngliÃ¦ mutari!â was the patriotic declaration of the Ancient Barons to King John. This lyric has been set to music by J. P. Knight.] The ancient Barons of the land Composed a haughty ring, Whenâmail on breast and blade in handâ They stood before the King; And, dauntless in their country's cause, Their high resolve avowedâ âWe will not that old England's laws Be changed by court or crowd! âIn other lands, at slightest shock, The civil fabric falls; In ours, eternal as the rock, It rears its massive walls; A barrier to convulsion forms, Firm as our Island's shore, Which has rolled back ten thousand storms, And will ten thousand more! âTo guaid its towers from age to age, Brave men their last have breathed; To us, as our best heritage, It was by them bequeathed. And, mark us, Sire! to its defence Our armsâour livesâwe vow; And it may fall in ages henceâ We Swear it shall not now!â They kept their oath, those gallant men! The structure still is ours, Though twice three hundred years since then Have overswept its towers. A glorious barrier still it forms, Firm as our Island's shoie, Which has rolled back ten thousand storms, And shall ten thousand more! It is Sad, very Sad. 1836. [I had been at Liverpool. It was night and there was deep snow on the ground. While coming over Blackstone Edge, in a stage coach, I wrote these lines.] It is sad, very sad, thus without thee to roam; It is sad, very sad, when the heart is at home! My dearestâyes, dearest! that word it shall be, For it has a sweet meaning when spoken of thee! My dearestâyes, dearest! &amp;c. My dearest, I've been where the wild billows roll, And I am where the scene should enrapture my soul; But, unmoved by the beauties of land and of sea, My souls finds them tastelessâungazed on by thee! My dearestâyes, dearest! &amp;c. Are my girls and my boys all as rosy and gay, Is my kind wife as well as when I came away? Are ever the questions returning to me; And soon be they answered by them and by thee! My dearestâyes, dearest! that word it shall be, For it has a sweet meaning when spoken of thee! The Friends that I Loved. 1836. The friends that I loved I love stillâbut no more Those friends of my bosom illumine my door; O! what can it be that has made them so cold, Who bore me such love and affection of old? My soul is the sameâby misfortune unbowed, It pities the poor, it despises the proud; And still are my feelings the same as of old; O! what can it be that has made them so cold? It is true that my visage is pallid and wornâ It is true that my garments are faded and tornâ And perhaps I'm so altered, they cannot descry The man at whose table they feasted so high! I was once of each party the life and the soul, My sallies were voted as bright as my bowl; And sometimes the reason I bitterly ask, Why the wit left my head when the wine left my cask? Well, mind them not, Ellen!âOne friend I have still, Who, kind in good fortune, is kinder in ill; And whose smile, like a glimpse of the sun in a shower, Can brighten Adversity's gloomiest hour! Sweet Beaumont Side. 1836. [Set to a very beautiful air by my late friend Mr. Wood, of Gargrave, and published with accompaniments by J. W. Thirlwall.] Sweet Beaumont Side, and Beaumont Stream! Though winds of winter round me blow, I cannot think, I cannot dream, With you that it is ever so. On Flasby Fell the blast may rave, The drift may whirl on frozen Aire; No winter binds the Beaumont's wave, No storm enshrouds a mountain there! Sweet Beaumont Side, and Beaumont Stream! Ye come to me in visions clear, And ever as ye were, ye seem; Change cannot touch a scene so dear! On Howsden heights for ever bloom, The flowers that lure the mountain bee; By Beaumont Side the yellow broom For ever wavesâin lightâto me! Sweet Beaumont Side, and Beaumont Stream! There is so much of gloom and ill, That it is soothing thus to deem Earth bears one spot of sunshine still; To feel thatâwhile my hopes decline, And joys from life's bleak waste departâ One bright illusionâyetâis mine, One changeless landscape of the heart! Your Name May be Noble. 1836. Your name may be noble, unsullied your race As the course of the mountain-rill pure from its spring, And you may have done nothing that name to disgrace; But you are not a Briton, if false to your King! You tell me of Freedom, I worship it too; Without it, my life were a valueless thing; But I find it consistent with Loyalty true,â And you are not a Briton, if false to your King! You tell me of EnglandâI'm proud of her name; To all that is bright in her story I cling; But it was under Monarchs she gathered her fame,â And you are not a Briton, if false to your King! The flock may be false to the shepherd that leads it Each morn during summer to pasture and springâ The child to the parent that fondles and feeds it, But ne'er will a Briton be false to his King! O Lay him by his Father! 1836. [The âfatherâ alluded to in this elegy, was the late Thomas Anderton, of Gargrave, a gentleman universally respected.] O lay him by his father, The mourned with many tears! Alas! we would have rather He had seen his father's years: But Death will ever gather All ages to his foldâ Then lay him by his father, The young man by the old! Lay the son beside the father, The branch beside the tree! We will not weep!âbut rather SayââRest ye peacefully, Till Godâour shepherdâgather His loved ones to his fold; Then riseâboth son and father, The young man and the old!â She is Falling by Grief. 1836. [On seeing the late Mrs. L?, of Seacombe, near Liverpool.] She is falling by grief, Like a rose in its prime, Ere the bloom of its leaf Bears a token of time, Which wastes every minute, Yet not from decay,â But a canker within it, That eats it away. No fairer draws breath; And no purer bore name, Till one wrong step brought death To her peace and her fame. O God! yet to win her From thoughts that o'er-prey, From the canker within her That eats her away! The Vows thou hast spoken. 1836. [Set to music by Frank de Fonblanque.] The vows thou hast spoken As oft as we met, Though lightsomely broken, Thou ne'er shalt forget; But fly where thou wilt, Thou shalt bear with thee still A feeling of guilt, And a presage of ill! The mild moon on high Shall thy falsehood upbraid, For she looked from the sky When the last vow was made. The morn with its light Shall remind thee of me, And my wrongs shall be blight On the day, and on thee! Another may hearken Thy suit with a smile, And I may not darken Thy hopes for a while; But, far from thee never, I'll mix with thy kissâ Intruding for ever Between thee and bliss! Deem not I'd inflict All this woe upon thee; Nor believe I predict What I gladly would see. O! it will not abate, love. One sorrow of mine, To know that a fate, love, Yet darker is thine! It is Sweet on this fair Bark. 1836. [Written at seaâoff the coast of Essex.] It is sweet on this fair bark to lean, And gaze upon the emerald sea, Whose waveletsâbreaking from the greenâ Seem snow-wreaths on an April lea, Or birdsâfor so will Fancy veerâ That brightly dive, and re-appear! There's beauty on the tinted brine, Which is not bounded by the coast; For yon delightful shores are thine, My native land, my pride, my boast! The peerless land where Freedom smiles, The glorious Queen of Ocean's Isles! The Music of another Spring. 1836. [Written during siekness.] The music of another spring I hear, that thought not to have heard; And seems it as no bird on wing Sung ever like yon early bird! Amid the silence of the morn, In these sweet notes that thrill my heart, A hope is to my bosom borneâ I shall notâyetâfrom earth depart! Fair earthâwhen spring-flowers round me bloom! Sweet timeâwhen spring-birds round me sing! O! but the grave's a thought of gloom, When all the land is gay with spring! I saw her in the Violet time. 1837. [On hearing of the death of Miss Hogarthâsecond daughter of George Hogarth, Esq., and sister-in-law of Charles Dickensâwhom I had seen in high health the year before. It has been often copied and circulated.] I saw her in the violet time, When bees are on the wing, And then she stood in maiden primeâ The fairest flower of spring! Her glances, as the falcon's bright, Had arch ness in their ray; Her motion and her heart were light As linnet's on the spray! 'Tis come again, the violet time, When flits the mountain bee; And others stand in maiden prime, But whereâO! where is She? Alas! the linnet now may sing Beside her early tomb! Alas! the fairest flower of spring Hath perished in its bloom! But no, but no! That maiden now, Immortal and serene, Wears glory on her noble brow That âeye hath never seen!â That flower, too soft for this world's air, Transplanted in its prime, Blooms now where it is always fair, And always violet time! The Hills of my Birth-place. 1837. [On revisiting my native county.] The hills of my birth-place I gazed on once more! And Cheviotâtheir Monarchâsublime as of yore, With the snow for his mantle, the cloud for his crown, On the white vales beneath him looked royally down! How my eyes grasped his bulk, till they filled, and grew dim! How I drank every breeze that was wafted from Him! That moment of feeling, so painfully dear, Which thus to my eyes sent the heart-gushing tear, âA moment collecting and pouring the whole Of the Past in a torrent at once on my soulâ As I stood in abstraction, absorbed, and alone, I would not have changed for the pomp of a throne! The torrent subsides when its sourees are drained; The ocean rolls back when its height is attained; And feeling, in bosoms that years cannot dull, Must ebb from the heart when its channels are full. Mine ebbed, but 'twas soon to flow fasterâfor yet There were scenes to be viewed, there were friends to be met! The warm hearts of Wansbeck, how warm were they still! How bright were the faces by Glen and by Till! My BeaumontâI saw but her mountains of snow, But knew that her broomy stream murmured below! And Tweedâalthough Winter was curbing its speed, No ice chilled the welcome I met with on Tweed! Shall Roddam be passed? Ah! in that dearest spot, Though I cannot forget, I am all but forgot! Still, she has her old dell, and she has her old stream, And a fairer The âfairer to haunt themâ was the lady whose death is lamented in the succeeding Poem. to haunt them than e'er blessed my dream; And proudly I ween that my fame shall be there, All fresh in her greenwoodsâwhile greenwoods are fair! Ay, my fame may be there; but O! never again Shall I con, in her greenwoods, the rapturous strain! For me each dear river all vainly will pour; Old Cheviot himself I shall visit no more; And the loved friends that dwell by those mountains and streams, Henceforward, alas, will but people my dreams! Though almost Twenty Years. 1837. [On the death of Mrs. Roddam of Roddam. She was one of those beings described by Moore, as ?âtoo lovely to remain. Creatures of light we never see again!â] Though almost twenty years have passed Since I in Roddam âloved and sungââ Though fame attends the lyre at last That first amid her woodlands rungâ My heart and soul are still the same; No scene of hers can I forget; In spite of distance, time, and fame, My sweetest thoughts are Roddam's yet! Where winds a glen and purls a rill, To her my fancy back they take; Where frowns a crag and towers a hill, I love them for old Cheviot's sake! The birds I hear, the flowers I see, Have charms that not to them belongâ These speak of Roddam's bloom to me, And those of Roddam's woodland song! Alas, alas, for Roddam now! Alas for Roddam's lord the most! Of shadowy brake and sunny brow The brightest, dearest charm is lost! Low is the Lady of the Hall, Whom I beheld so lately there, The loveliest and the best of all That ever graced the scenery fair! I gazed, and thoughtâfor poets build Most gorgeous castles on the cloud, And with the rays of Fancy gild Triumphal arch and turret proudâ I thought how she, with kind regard, Might give old hopes again to bloom, Might patronise her House's Bard: She sleeps within her House's Tomb! Green o'er that Tomb already grow The laurels due to valiant deed; A gentler wreath we mingle now As Beauty's and as Virtue's meed. We bring each bloom from Roddam Dell That scents its depth, or gems its verge, And bid the Lyre of Roddam swell To ring the Flower of Roddam's dirge The Union Workhouse. 1837. [Written in a desponding mood. The names are those of my children, most of whom are now beyond the reach of want and of workhouse tyranny! I cannot resist saying that the Right Honourable Matthew Talbot Baines was the first Minister who, by his humane and enlightened management, rendered the New Poor Law Act tolerable to the English people.] Ahouse they've built on yonder slope Huge, grim, and prison-like, and dull! With grated walls that shut out Hope, And cells of wretched paupers full. And they, if we for help should call, Will thither take and lodge us thus; But Ellen, no! Their prison wall, I swear it, was not built for us! We've lived together fourteen years; Three boys and four sweet girls are ours; Our life hath had its hopes and fears, Its autumn blights, its summer flowers; But ever with determined front, And heart that scorned in ill to bow, Have we sustained Misfortune's brunt: We never quailedânor will we now! Our eldest hopeâour Sallyâshe Who steals from e'en her play to books, O God! in yon Bastile to see The sweetness of her modest looks! And Esty, who hath little mind For books when there is time to play, Her little heart would burst, to find The same dull prison every day! His father's picture, too, my Bob, My double both in head and heartâ And Bill, whom it were sin to rob Of his red cheek and emulous partâ And Fanny with her craftinessâ And Jack who screams so very lowâ Shall they put on their prison-dress? My dearâmy dearâthey shall not go! They shall not goâto pine apart, Forgetting kindredship and home; To lose each impulse of the heart That binds us wheresoe'er we roam! And we, whom God and Love made one, Whom Man and Law would disunite, We will not, Famine's death to shun, Sleep there, or wake, a single night! Still is their actâin somethingâmild: Though I no more must share your rest, They would permit your infant child Toâtug at an exhausted breast! And Jack would cease, poor boy! to scream, Awed by some keeper's rod and threat; While, sunk in cribs, the rest would dream Of daysâtoo well remembered yet! Away! On England's soil we stand; Our means have, erst, supplied the poor We have claims on our father-land:â No, noâthat right is ours no more! But we will die a Beggar's death, Rather than pass their hated wall! On some free hill breathe out our breathâ One nameless grave receiving all! O Faded Leaf. 1837. O faded leaf! O faded heart! The summer hue of both is gone! The storms of fate may do their part, The storms of winter ravage on! The heartâthe leafâhave felt the worst; No further blight can either know; Andâall unfearedâshall o'er them burst The future wind, the future woe! Unlike the leaf in June's caress! Unlike the heart when sorrow-free!â But yet there springs from hopelessness A stern, defying energy; Forâthe worst known, and scorned the worstâ The man hath nought to fear below, And asks notârecks notâwhen shall burst The future wind, the future woe! The Rose of the Isles. 1837. [This song was written on the occasion of Her Majesty's accession to the throne. Those who, like the author, are old enough to remember the late Princess Charlotte, will feel the compliment implied in the allusion to her. A younger generation cannot.] The Crown that cncircles Victoria's brow, Transmitted through ages of fame, To its claims on our love adds a sweeter one now, Derived from her sex and her name. And the Sceptre she wields in her delicate hand, As she stands in the sunshine of smiles, Hath a spell to array all the Might of the Land Around the fair Rose of the Isles! Not a word of division shall burden our breath, Of the parties or views we prefer; Howe'er we may differ in feeling or faith, We are oneâin devotion to Her! Our Charlotte in all but her sadness of doom, May she live in the sunshine of smiles! And never may sorrow-blight fall on the bloom Of the beautiful Rose of the Isles! I was Born in a Cot. 1837. I was born in a Cot, and in one I may die; So lived and so perished my fathers obscure; But no Peer of his lineage is prouder than I, For my fathers were honest, and loyal, and poor! I envy notâcovet notâtitle and sway; Yet 'tis pleasant to think that to all they are free, Thatâthanks to the laws of my country! the way To her honours is openâay, even to me. I'm content to be part of society's root; To find that the branches which over us wave, Derive from us foliage, blossom, and fruit,â And give us again all the strength that we gave. And never, when clamour and menace are loud Against all that is noble, and all that is high, Will I lend my voice to the cry of the crowdâ I know the result of that reasonless cry! I know that the lightning their madness would lanch, Though meant but to injure the loftiest shoots, Conducted that instant from twig and from branch, Would glance to, and shiver the trunk to the roots! An Englishman's Wife. 1838. [Written for a Bazaar Volume, dedieated to the late Queen Adelaide.] The merry bells ring, and the merry boys shout, The matrons are gazing from window and door; For a blithe wedding train the Old Church hath poured out, And the green lane is crowded behind and before. A fair Village Maiden hath promised today, To love and to cherish her Chosen through life; And she walks by his side in her bridal array, To be from this moment an Englishman's Wife. And O! if he knows it, a treasure he gains To which all the gems of Golconda are dim, A counsellor kind who, in pleasures or pains, Will think for his welfare, exist but for him! His children to train âin the way they should go,â To ward from his dwelling the entrance of strife, To soothe him in anger, to solace in woe, Is the dutyâthe boastâof an Englishman's Wife! Scarce heeded the light of a long sunny day, We love, when the sky is o'erclouded, to mark A sun-burst on hill or on shaded vale playâ A type of her love when his atmosphere's dark! Her smile, in success which unheeded may beam, Will shine like that sun-burst when sorrows are rife, Ay, pour round his death-bed itself a bright gleam!â For true to the last is an Englishman's Wife. It is so in the Cottage; and who can forget How deeply 'twas so in the Palace of late, When, by the sad couch of her dying lord set, Queen Adelaide's watchfulness sweetened his fate? Unwearied and sleeplessâher task to fulfil, She sat and she soothed the last tremours of life; And her love for our William endears to us still That Model revered of an Englishman's Wife! I Blame thee not, World! 1839. I blame thee not, World! that thy judgments refuse me The laureate wreath I have coveted long; I have rather to thank the kind hearts that excuse me The times I have teased them with efforts in song. The vision that lured me of Glory's effulgence Hath passedâlike the bow from the cloud of the shower; I find, after years of self-cheating indulgence, That the wish to be great I mistook for the pouer. Then adieu to the hope, to my bosom so pleasing, Of being remembered and talked of when gone; And adieu to the hope, more ambitious, of seizing The mind of the future, and moulding its tone! Adieu to those fond aspirations, but neverâ While breath is within meâfarewell to the Muse! It were easier to turn from its channel yon river, Than me from the course that she taught me to choose. I must still feel the changes of sky and of season, Be alive, like the birds, to each impulse they bring; And, heard or not heard by the children of reason, Must at times, like those wild-birds, full-heartedly sing! But adieu to the hope, to my bosom so pleasing, Of being remembered and talked of when gone; And adieu to the hope, more ambitious, of seizing The mind of the future, and moulding its tone! Perchance with myself lies the blame of bereavement Of the long-cherished dream of celebrity won: Like the birds I have lived, and no worthy achievement, They say, without careâwithout labourâis done. Hence in song, as in life, I too nearly resemble The light-hearted lyrists that sing in the glen, Whose note, though it may bid the young bosom tremble, Wants the bold trumpet-tone that electrifies men. Then adieu to the hope, to my bosom so pleasing, Of being remembered and talked of when gone; And adieu to the hope, more ambitious, of seizing The mind of the future, and moulding its tone!â Dear Hudson. 1840. Dear Hudson, a winter of time has gone by Since last we were seated together; Bat my soul never shrunk for the scowl of the sky, And it still bids deflance to weather! But why should I hint at my griefs, 'mid the light That from wine and true friendship we borrow? We wont have a word but of pleasure tonightâ We can talk of our troubles tomorrow. What's the want men so shun, or the wealth they so crave, That a care about either should bind us? A good name is the thing, which, surviving the grave, Shall leave its long perfume behind us. One hourâbe futurity gloomy or brightâ This hour shall be sacred from sorrow; We wont have a word but of pleasure tonightâ We can talk of our troubles tomorrow. She shall not Die. 1841. [On the death of Mrs. Hudson, wife of the gentleman to whom the preceding song is addressed.] She shall not dieâas thousands dieâ To be forgot ere long; The poet's friend shall claim a sigh While lives the poet's song!â Such was the inward vow I made, When o'er my hour of mirth The tidings flashed, that cold was laid The kindest heart on earth. Then winter wrapped the land in snow; The summer decks it now; Yet unawaked one note of woe, And unfulfilled my vow. And ah! unless the poet could Take all of sweet and fair That summer sheds by vale and wood, And all the music thereâ Could take from flowers their fairest hues, Their sweetest notes from birds, And by some magic skill transfuse The whole into his wordsâ How should he hope, in phrases meet, His tribute to prefer? Or how reflect the virtues sweet That lived and bloomed in Her? Vain effort! She who sleeps below, Must sleep unsung as nowâ Still unawaked one note of woe, And unfulfilled my vow, Save for these rhymes, which, unreproved, May this proud boast prolongâ âHe had a friend too much beloved, Too deeply mourned, for song!â Ingleboro' Cave. 1840. [This wonderful subterranean vaultâor rather succession of irregular vaultsâis but poorly described in the following stanzas. It was then a recent discovery. It is the property of James William Farrer, Esq., of Ingleboro' Hall.] Lover of Nature! whose feet have pervaded The wildest recesses where verdure has birth, And whose eyes have beheld, from these mountains unshaded, The grandeur of ocean, the beauty of earth, Deem not, though thy pleasures be pure and abiding, That thou hast exhausted the whole she e'er gave; Go, enter yon rock, whence the waters are gliding, And witness the wonders she works in the Cave: Go then, and alone, wouldst thou feel the seene rightly The Poet, invisibly joining thy side, Shall talk with thy soul, shall be moral or sprightly, And summon his spirits to light thee and guide! Look up! the green day-light yet blends with the lustres Sprite-furnished, and gleaming along the dark wave; Smooth rock hung with pendants like icicle-clustersâ What ceiling can vie with the roof of the Cave? But on!âThe day fades; and the lights, borne before us, The brighter appear, and the richer by far; For see them beneath us, beside us, and o'er us, Reflected from diamond, water, and spar! If splendour thou lovest, 'tis here in profusion, More pure than in courts, for it doth not deprave; And shouldst thou point out that the whole is illusion, I ask, is illusion confined to the Cave? On, on!âThe lights pause. Is yon black rock the ending? No, no; thou hast farther, and fairer, to view; So, follow we must where the elf-lightsâdescendingâ Half show a low vault. Don't they burn a bit blue? Start not! there's no ghost, I assure you, to fear, sir; But stoopâlower yetâif thy head thou wouldst save: Pride sometimes gets checked in his onward career, sir, And Humility's well in the world, and the Cave. But hark! there is music! All fairy-like stealing, It comes on the ear, as from distance it came: 'Tis Nature's own harmony, fitfuily pealing, And this for her Palace the Goddess may claim. Look round! 'tis enchantment! surpassing whatever The tales of the East on young fancies engrave; So, now for description, my friend, if thou'rt cleverâ Reflect me in song this State-room of the Cave. What song shall reflect it?âA gem-studded ceiling, On columns of crystal appearing to lean; Sides flashing with brilliants; the wide floor revealing A pure water-mirror that doubles the scene;â Away! 'tis prosaic, where all should be sparkling, And rugged, where Music should breathe through the stave. But see! my torch-bearers have left us, andâdarklingâ We follow the light as it winds up the Cave. Then on!âWe are now at the roots of the mountain, Where Nature, as knowing the pressure, has thrown A bold massive arch o'er the line of the fountain, An arch Ã  la Gothicâere Gothic was known! Here rest we beforeâinto day-light returningâ We return, too, to cares and to topics more grave; And mixing a bowl, while the elf-lights are burning, Let us drink to the health of the lord of the Cave! O Spare the Kind Heart. 1841. [On reading Lord Francis Egerton's address to the Electors of South Lancashire, in which he alluded to the infirm state of his health. This Nobleman, since known as the Earl of Ellesmere, has died while these sheets were in the press. The lines may now, alas! stand as a slight but sincere tribute to his memory. O spare the kind heart long to beat as it does, Instinct with all feelings delightful and pure! And spare the clear head, now so needful to us, Who battle our birth-right to save and sceure! When the agents of Evil are active and rife, When Treason, or Folly, presides at the helm, We ask thee, O Heaven! to leave us a life Devoted and bound to the weal of the realm! We ask thee to leave us that something, of which Crowds feel the effect, though they gucss not its cause, Which, preceding his eloquence flowing and rich, In look and in bearing still wins, while it awes! We ask thee to leave us that eloquence, filled With all that Refinement and Genius infuseâ As soft as the dew from a spring mist distilled, And sweet as the harmonies breathed by the Museâ Coming, not like a summer-stream swollen by rain, A torrent that fails when the shower-cloud is gone, But a fount-supplied river, that rolls through the plain, And, strong but yet gentle, in sunshine rolls on! We ask thee to leave us that character, bright With virtues not drawing their lustre from birth, But blending with that all the charm of their light, To brilliance of Name adding brilliance of Worth. Yes! spare the kind heart long to beat as it does, Instinct with all feelings delightful and pure! And spare the clear head now so needful to us, When battling our birth-right to save and secure! Yon Lass ye See. 1841. Yon lass ye see sae lightly trip, She has, nae doubt, a rosy lip, And ye might, maybe, like to sip Its hineyed dews yere lane, lad; But she isna like my ain wife, My ain, ain, ain wife, There's nane like my ain wifeâ I'll say't and say't again, lad! Yon lassie has a bright blue e'e, Wi' glance sae pawky and sae slee, And ye might, maybe, like to see Its love-blinks a' yere ain, lad; But she isna like, &amp;c. A rosier lip, a pawkier e'e Its mine to prize, and mine to prie, And O! a heart that's a' for me, For me, and me alane, lad! There's nane like, &amp;c. When blasts o' cauld misfortune blaw, And puirtith's showers around me fa', Her bonnie smile gleams thro' them a', Like sunshine in the rain lad! There's nane like, &amp;c. And then wi' buds she's decked my bower As bonnie as the mither-flower, And placed wi' them, its past my power To say how proud and fain, lad, I sit beside my ain wife, My ain, ain, ain wife, There's nane like my ain wifeâ I'll say't and say't again lad!â Poor Mary. 1842. [âPoor Maryâ was Mary Batty, of Skipton,âa fair pupil of mine.] In spring, alas! poor Mary dies, Ere many springs have found her; An early-blighted flower she lies, When all is blooming round her! Yet consolation gilds the tear With which her fate we ponder: She never caused a sorrow here, And ne'er will meet one yonder! A Happy New Year. 1842. There was gloom, there was grief, in the year that is sped; But 'tis goneâand we will not speak ill of the dead! Many joys it has left us, in friends that are dear, And we'll wish one another a happy new year! Many joys it has left us; but some it has ta'enâ There were faces we never shall look on again; Kind hearts ever ready to welcome and cheer, That now cannot wish us a happy new year! And some we must think of, the friends of our soul, Though far they may be from our board and our bowl; We know they have hearts that are warm and sincere, And we'll wish them, though absent, a happy new year! For those that are with usâtheir glances attest That the same tide of feeling is high in each breast; That one chain of kindness links all that are here, As we wish one another a happy new year! Then, old friend, take my hand, and be sureâwhen I claspâ There is heart in its pulse, there is soul in its grasp! And if you could doubt it, this truth-speaking tear Will tell how I wish you a happy new year! O Sing to me no Modish Tune. 1842. [Calder Fair is the name of an air which was a great favourite with the dancers in my young days.] O sing to me no modish tune, But some old Scottish air, love; And would you give my heart a boon, Then sing it Calder Fair, love? I know that tasteful ears would scorn A thing so simple and so worn; But pleasant dreams to me are borne In the notes of Calder Fair, love! Then sing to me, &amp;c. Again I lead the village dance, Or join the village ring, love; Again I mark the roguish glance That Peggy used to fling, love. The reeling and the revelry, The wooing and the witchery, Return in all their truth to me When that old air you sing, love. Then sing to me, &amp;c. It throws me back the years long fled On Memory's mirror true, love; The married are again unwed, The faded bloom anew, love; Her stately shape my Mary shows, And blooms my Jeanie's lip of rose; Ayâforms that now in dust repose, Are passing in my view, love! Then sing to me, &amp;c. Nor while your notes those years restore, Need you have doubts of me, love; I would not wish to live them o'er, Nor what I've been to be, love; With pleasure, but without regret, I see my loves in memory yet; For all their beauties here are metâ I clasp them all in thee, love; Then sing to me, &amp;c. The Day is Gane. 1842. [These lines allude to a freak of mine when a boy of nine years.] The day is gane when I could keep Step wi' the lave by the Ha'-house fire; The day is gane when I could sleep Sound as a top in barn or byre. I'm altered noo in mind and mood; In loftier things I seek my joy; I've gotten a name wad mak' some proud;â But the Minstrel's no the Minstrel's Boy! I hate the warl's heartless mass, Vile, dirty dross their end and aim; Yet Iâif I erect wad passâ Maun steep my soul in filth like them. For time brought luve, and luve brought care, And care brings meikle o' annoy: I'd gie some coin to wear ance mair The lightsome heart o' the Minstrel's Boy! Mute is the Lyre of Ebor. 1842. âWe bring our years to an end, as it were a tale that is told.â Psalms. [On the death of John Nicholson, well known in the North as âThe Airedale Poet.â His life has been foreibly written by my friend John James, and prefixed to a posthumous edition of the poet's worksâpublished for the benefit of his widow and children. Mr. James is himself distinguished by a âHistory of Bradford,â which has been pronounced one of the very best local histories extant.] Mute is the Lyre of Ebor! cold The Minstrel of the streamy Aire! The âyearsâ are passed, the âtaleâ is told: Prepare the shroud, the grave prepare! The tale is toldâwhat is the tale? The same that still the ear hath won, As oft as, in life's humbler vale, Genius hath found a wayward Son. First comes the magic time of life, When Boyhood sees nor dreams of gloom; And when within the breast are rife Thoughts that are made of light and bloom! Then Youth will all its burning hopes Of fame and glory ne'er to die, When manfully with fate he copes, And will not see a peril nigh. At length he gives to public gaze The transcript of his glowing thought; And vulgar marvel, high-born praise, Seem earnests of the meed he sought. Now round him crowd, where'er he wends, His mind yet pure and undebased, The countless troop of talent's friends, Men who affectâbut have notâtaste. These bid him press to eager lips The double poison of their bowlâ Flatteries that weaken as he sips, And draughts that darken sense and soul: O for a voice to rouse him up, To warn him, ere too late it be, That Frenzy mantles in the cup, And that its dregs areâMisery! Days passâyears rollâthe novelty That charmed at first, is faded now: And men that sought his hour of glee, Repel him with an altered brow. Where is the bard's indignant breath? Alas, the bard, from habits learned, Is powerless to resent; and Death Kindly receives himâspent and spurned! Talk ye of Fame? O! he hath borne Contempt, alive; but praise him, dead! Ay, mourn himâwhom ye left to mourn! Give him a stoneâye gave not bread! No more. The old, sad tale is told Prepare the shroud, the grave prepare; For mute is Ebor's Lyre, and cold The Minstrel of the streamy Aire! I would not pass from Earth. 1842. [This is the last piece of verse I composed in Craven.] I would not pass from Earth In the sweet spring-time, When all fair things have birth In our Northland clime! When the forest's song is new; When the violet blooms in dew; When the living woods are seen In their first and freshest green; When the laughing mead unfolds A hue that shames the gold's; When each hawthorn-hedge, in blow, Seems a wreath of summer snow; When the azure river glides Through flowers that fringe its sides, And, crowding rich and rife, Drink thence exulting life;â O! I would not vanish then From the world of living men! I know that, after death, The Soul shall draw her breath In a purer, finer air, And 'mid scenes surpassing fair; But I feelâand be it said Not profanely!âmight I tread The vales of Heaven, e'en then I should dream of earth again! So deep, here, the love-trace Of Nature and of Place, That my musings would come back To their old and hallowed track, Leave the pure life-waters there For the Beaumont and the Aire! For beautiful is earth In the sweet spring-time, When all fair things have birth In our Northland clime! Above the Line of Lamps. 1843. [Written in London.] Above the line of lamps, above The smoke that dims the evening air, The Moon, whose beams I used to love, Is shining now as calmly fairâ I cannot doubtâas when she smiled Upon me in some Northern glen, Or by some mountain vast and wild, Where rocks wereânot rock-hearted men. And even now on many a spotâ Still loved, though leftâshe glances down; Beheld by, but beholding not, My friends in hamlet and in town. I would I were upon her sphere! And were with powers of vision blest, Extensive as her beams and clear!â O! where would, then, my vision rest? Not on the starsâthough Mystery Sat 'mid their orbs, my gaze to draw! Not on the seasâthough gloriously Flashed thence the pomp of Night I saw! But on the hills, and by the streams, Whose very names are song to me; And round the homes, where fancy dreams Warm-hearted friends of mine may be; On Cheviot, sung in many a lay; By Beaumont, named in few but mine; By Till, that past the ruins gray Of Etal leads its silver line; By Wansbeck, rippling on its course; By Tyne, that mirrors banks so fair; By streamy Aire's romantic source; And by the Ribbleâdear as Aire! Hallowed by Friendship and the Muse, O'er them mine eyes would rove or rest: For I am one who never lose One kind emotion of the breast. Let the cold sons of Reason claim The praise of science and of art; All art, all science, and their fame, Are nothingâweighed against the Heart! It Ne'er was Spak'. 1844. [Written in one of the fields of Roddam.] It ne'er was spak', but aft was look'd; I ken'd it in your e'e, Jeanie; An' for the luve to me you bore, I've often thought o' thee, Jeanie. While faces, ance perferr'd to thine, I willingly forget, Jeanie; Thy sonsie look o' unsought luve, I mind and prize it yet, Jeanie! An' now I'm in the field we reap'd, An' sigh to think ye're gane, Jeanie; For finer form there might ha beenâ But kinder heart was nane, Jeanie! The Bonnie Pink Flower. 1844 [The hill alluded to in the following lines is the Lanton Hill so often mentioned. I saw the flower and wrote the song in 1844. It has been set to music by my friend Waller, with accompaniments by Thirlwall.] I cam to the hill whare a boy I had wander'd An' high beat my heart when I traced it again!â As up its steep sideânow an auld manâI dander'd, I stopp'd whare a bonnie Pink blossom'd its lane. It seem'd a wee star lighted up amang heather! My first thought saidââPu' it, an' bring it away;â But a tenderer pleadedââHow soon it wad wither! O! leave it to bloom on its ain native brae! âFor wha kens,â pled the Thought, âbut this bonnie flower bloomin', May hae some kin' o' feelin' or sense o' its ain? It 'ill change wi' the lift, be it smilin' or gloomin', Exult in the sunshine, an' droop in the rain. An' wha kens that it hasna some pleasure in gi'ein' Its bloom to the e'e an' its sweets to the day? That it hasna a secret an' sweet sense o' bein'?ââ Sae I left it to bloom on its ain native brae! Wad the young man but learn frae this simple narration, When he meets wi' a bonnie lass bloomin' her lane, To thinkâthat tho' poor, an' tho' lowly in station, The lass has a heart he may please, or may pain! Then, if he can mak' her a wife, let him tak' her, An' bear her in joy an' in triumph away; But O! if he cannaâbeguile her he manna, But leave her to bloom on her ain native brae! Mony Auld Frien's. 1844. [The gentleman whose death called forth these linesâthe âDear Hudsonâ of a very different song in this collectionâwas, without one exception, the best man I ever knew. His enthusiastic friendship for myself, his disinterested zeal for my reputation and successâI shall never forget. Nor has he all died! On my last visit to York-shire, I found his spirit still animating his friends, and meeting me at every turn, with the welcome of the years that are past. âAlas, how differentâyet how like the same!â] Mony auld frien's to Town come, in kind-ness, to me, Wi' the heart in the hand, an' the soul in the e'e; An' blithely I meet them, as aft as they ca'; But there's ane that comes neverâthe dearest of a'! There's aften some failin' where maist ane wad lean; Some mickle 'ill phraise when but little they mean. You felt his heart beat in ilk word he let fa'; But that kind ane comes neverâthe dearest of a'! It isna the distanceâthat soon wad be pass'd; Its nae fit o' cauldnessâthat short while wad last; Its the stern grip o' Death that keeps Hudson awa', An' he will come neverâthe dearest of a'! My ain day is closin', and I, too, maun dee. I scarce care how soonâif wi' him I may be! For nane but guid fellows around him 'ill draw, And be they a' monarchs, he's King them a'! O let us be Friendly? 1845. [Written for an annual dinner party, chiefly composed of certain officials of the Houses of Parliament.] O let us be friendly! since brief is life's day, And seldom undimmed by some trouble its ray, 'Twere folly in rancour or strife to employ One moment that might be devoted to joy. Impressed with this truth are the hearts that meet here, For a banquet of friendship and mirth once a year; And no strife shall intrude, and no rancour ensue, For âBe friendlyâ 's the word when I'm dining with You At home we have caresâbut we leave them to-day; In the world there is businessâ'tis not in our way; Our business goes on, when our joys are improving, And our care is, to see that the bottles keep moving! The Queen, be she happy!âwe're happy as she; The Lords, be they wiseâare they wiser than we? And as for the Commons, I hold it quite true, I am not of the Commons when dining with You! Then fill round a bumper, and each, in his place, Drink with meâto the weal of the whole human race! Whatever his colour, his clime, or his creed, Be he savage or oivilised, fettered or freed, Each man upon us hath the claim of a brother! And if you can be touched by the woes of another, You will pledge me with feelings befitting and due, Nor allow them to partâwhen I've parted from You! We often Laughed at Fanny. 1846. We often laughed at Fanny, But we loved her while we laughed; She was so odd a mixture Of simplicity and craft. Whate'er she thought she uttered, And her wordsâshe âreckon'd nou'tâ Of the fine flash talk of London: Hers was Yorkshire out and out! While her little schemes of cunning, Which she thought so veiled, were still As obvious as the channel Of the purest mountain rill. Thus her heart being good and gentle, And transparent all her craft, We often laughed at Fanny, But we loved her while we laughed! A short life was my Fanny's, And slight the warning given! But her sins were those of childhood, And her spirit is in Heaven. All through her words, when dying, Ran a vein of solemn thought; And we felt how wise was Fanny,â We had laughed more than we ought. Yet even in those moments Came out a phrase, a word, That reminded us of periods When the same with mirth we heard. And we oft recall her sayings, Her playfulness and craft; But nowâ'tis oddâwe weep the most At what the most we laughed! My William. 1846. My William died in London, In London broad and brave; His little life was but a drop Dashed from her mighty wave! And few there were that mourned my boy, When he went to his grave. Few mournedâand when we laid him In his earth-bed cold and low, No hireling Mute, I said, should stand In mimicry of woe; But genuine tears, from eyes he loved, Flowed forthâas still they flow. I thoughtâbut that was weaknessâ I had rather seen him laid In the distant, rural, green churchyard Near which a child he played, With daisies o'er the turf to bloom, And no dull walls to shade. How shall we e'er forget him? His eye, instinct with lightâ His cheek's fair bloom, which Death itself Found it most hard to blightâ His little manly bearingâall That made our cottage bright! Above a boy ambitious, To learn, to work, to riseâ Beyond his years considerate, And ominously wiseâ O how I prized him! Now, it seems That half I did not prize. O London! fatal London! How proud to come was I! How proud was he! how proud were all! And all have comeâto die! Pass on, sad years! and close the tale With its best wordsââHere lieââ The Chain is Broken, Father. 1847. [Supposed to be addressed to her father by Mrs. D?, (who had been unhappily married,) on the death of her mother.] The chain is broken, Father, That bound together three; The middle link is taken;â But thou art left to me, And I to thee, my Father! And here I promise thee, That ne'er was truer Daughter found, Than thou shalt find in me! I have no tie to life, Father; Save thee, I have not one! I bear indeed the name of wife, But husband I have none. I name not this regretfullyâ All that is over nowâ I name it but to let thee see That my sole tie art Thou! And I will tend thee, Father, As long as I have breath; And if it please my Mother's God, I'll tend thy bed of death. Then, the last tie dissevered, I'll follow her and thee, Where Love shall join the links again That bound together three! Sleep, my Mary! 1847. [Music by Thirlwall.] Sleep, my Mary! sleep, my Mary! Sleep, though darksome be thy bed; Sleep, my Mary! sleep, my Mary! Sleep, though round thee lie the dead! Sleep!âTo this bed comes not nigh Tortured night, or troubled day; Fearless sleep, the dead that lie Round theeâO how harmless they! Sleep, my Mary! sleep, my Mary! Dream not thou art left aloneâ Listen, Mary! listen, Mary! Well was once my footstep known!â Hush!âThat sob was much too loud; Glad I am the grave is deep! It would pain her in her shroud, Could she hear her father weep! Sleep, my Mary! sleep, my Mary! Dead thou art notâscarce removed; Still, my Mary! still, my Mary! Thou art living, thou art loved! Living stillâat least to me, Still before my inward eye; Lovedâas nothing clse can be! Lovedâtill life and memory die! 'Tis Sweet to Escape. 1847. [Music by the same.] 'Tis sweet to escape from the noise of the city, And spend one free day with a few we hold dear, Whoâall of them pleasant, and some of them wittyâ Are sure to make that day the gem of the year. The Thames that rolls by with its freightage of treasure, Must ebbâwhile we sitâin its changeful career; But no ebb shall take place in our spring-tide of pleasure, Till the sun has gone down on this gem of the year! If the days we have passed had their trouble or sorrow, If the heart had its pang and the eye had its tear,â Sad thought may return with the gloom of to-morrow; Such thought shall not sully this gem of the year! 'Tis a banquet of Friendship, which after-reflection The deeper shall hallow, the more shall endear; For long shall come back on each pleased recollection The beauty and light of this gem of the year! E'en now, when the Winds. 1848. [Written after the French Revolution of this year, which sent his Majesty, the late Louis Phillippe, into exile.] E'en nowâwhen the winds have dispelled the dark smoke, And the sun shines again as it previously shone; When the Earthquake is over, whose terrible shock Made chaff of a Dynasty, dust of a Throne!â E'en nowâwhen the pulse of the generous beats high With hope for the future of France and of Man, And the sanguine believe that an era draws nigh To shame the most brilliant since nations began!â E'en now do I turn to my own Native Land, With a love all the prouder for all I behold; And exult in a Freedom not based in the sand, But built on a rock, and more fixed as more old!â A Freedom which is not the spoil of an hour, Achieved by one impulse, and lost if that dies; But the prize of long struggles, and leftâa rich dowerâ To ourselves and our sons by progenitors wise!â A Freedom which keeps us within the safe mean, Which limits our contests to party alone; A statesman cashiersânot imperils the Queen, A cabinet shakesânot unfixes the Throne! A Freedom which laughs at equality, but Its posts and its honours throws open to all; Whence a Briton may draw his first breath in the hut, And, rising to greatness, may die in the hall!â A Freedom which holds this fair Island in peace, When strife and dismay over Europe are hurled; And whichâguarded by patriotsânever shall cease To shed its calm light through the storms of the world! At Parker's Tomb. 1848. [I knew the late Mr. Parker, of the Iff, in the West Riding of York-shire, well. He deserved every word of the character I have given him in the Epitaph.] At Parker's Tombâexultingâsay: He from the Right ne'er swerved, But, faithfully and well, âhis day And generationâ served. Unwarped by censure or applause; Still firm, however tried; The world's amount of virtue was Diminished when he died! His death was mourned by friends untold, And e'en his foes confess, That now the Queen's dominions hold One honest man the less. O Scorn not the Plough! 1849. O scorn not the Plough! which for ages hath been The boast of this Isle of the Free; And for ages to come, when our tombstones are green, Our Posterity's boast let it be Our cottons and silks we might give to the moth, Nor be much the worse off, you'll allow; The loom, after all, can but furnish his Cloth, The Man is sustained by the Plough! It was well with our sires when their wives spun the fleece That at church and at market they wore; When the loomâstill domesticâwas clicking in peace On the flags of the cottager's floor. And though manners have changed, yet let worst come to worst, We could live as they lived, even now; For garb is but second, food ever is first, And our food is produced by the Plough! When England waged warâas again she may do, And conqueredâas conquer she will, Whence came the brave bands that, on red Waterloo, Kept her soil the free soil it is still? All fresh from the countryânot pale from the townsâ They marched, as they still would, I trow; The fine healthy men of the dales and the downs, The broad-shouldered sons of the Plough! My Bark is on the Tyne. 1849. [Founded on an old Northumbrian song, of which I never heard more than the tune and chorus: â? Till the tide come in, till the tide come in, We'll kiss a bonny lassie till the tide come in.â Set to music by Alicia Bennett.] My bark is on the Tyne, and the wind blows fair; The tide is rising fast, and I've little time to spare; But, before the latest moment, to part would be a sin! So we'll kiss, my bonny Mary, till the tide come in. Till the tide come in, till the tide come in, We'll kiss, my bonny Mary, till the tide come in. But why that filling eye, and that pale drooping brow? I cannot bear those sighs, love! I pray suppress them now. Let all without seem pleasure, though all be sad within, And we'll kiss, my bonny Mary, till the tide come in. Till the tide come in, &amp;c. I thank thee for that smile, it is sunshine to me; And I'll keep it in my heart when I'm far away at sea; It will lighten on my watch when the lonely hours begin! So we'll kiss, my bonny Mary, till the tide come in. Till the tide come in, &amp;c. It will lighten on my watch, like a moonbeam on deck; It will shine if there be battle, it will gleam if there be wreck; It will nerve my soul in danger, an honoured name to win! So we'll kiss, my bonny Mary, till the tide come in. Till the tide come in, &amp;c. Again that eye is filled! Well, unblamed it now must be; But weep not long, my dearest; and breathe oft a prayer for me! That prayer shall safe return me from the storm's or battle's din, To woo my bonny Mary till the tide come in! Till the tide come in, &amp;c. When Freedom. 1849. When Freedom made this Constitution of ours, Which you shall not find matched if the wide world you range, Two Spirits she chose to keep watch on its powersâ The Spirit of Caution, the Spirit of Change. âIf Caution,â she said, âwould too slowly proceed, Then, Change, do thy part, nor allow him to flag; And if Change urge the engine to perilous speed, Then, Caution, be ready to slip on the drag!â Thus ever those Spirits keep watch on its powers, Retard, or impel, as the need becomes known; And 'tis by them that this Constitution of ours In the line of Improvement rolls steadily on. And Britons have but to preserve it intactâ Secure that its working no power can derange, While the Spirit of Change shall force Caution to act, And the Spirit of Caution shall regulate Change? The Seasons in Passing. 1849. The seasons, in passing, one sweet moral bring, And wellâif he marked itâwould man do; âSpread pleasureâlike me,â is the language of Spring, âMake all hearts as glad as you can do!â The Summer but varies it: âMake each heart glad, Treat all with the warmth of affection; My sun shines alike on the good and the bad, And shall you dare to think of selection?â The Autumn repeats it: âMy stores are for all; But should one, in the scramble, get favour, Let him share it with those to whom little may fall, And what's left will have all the more savour!â And Winter affirms itâwhile shaking the door, And binding the stream with his fetter: âKeep the cold that I bring, from the hearths of the poor, And your own will burn brighter and better!â So speaks every Season that comes and departs, To the bosoms of all men appealingâ Alas, that it touches so few of our hearts! That so many continue unfeeling! What a world it would be, ifâless mindful of pelfâ We esteemed every neighbour a brother; And if each, while he did a bit good for himself, Did a little bit, too, for another! In Youth our Fathers. 1849. [For Her Majesty's birth-day.] In youth, our fathers sought the wood, Or climbed the hill at dawning gay; Our mothers, in their maidenhood, Donned their best garb to greet the May. And though old rites have passed away, The May is still with honour seenâ We love the Month that brings the day, The natal day of England's Queen. Our fathers twined the blossomed bough To deck their chosen Queen of May; To ours, their love Three Kingdoms vow, An Empire's millions homage pay! Their May-Queen reigned a single day, Then passed, unnoticed, o'er the green; Through all the year we own the sway, And bless the rule, of England's Queen! May brings, at eve, the loveliest star, At eve, the moon of softest ray; In May, the night's the fairest far, The sweetest morning breaksâin May. Then brightest blooms the woodland spray, Then purest lies the dew-drop sheenâ As Nature's self would grace the day That graced the world with England's Queen: Guthrum the Dane: A TALE OF THE HEPTARCHY. 1849â50. TO MISS REANEY OF BRADFORD (IN THE COUNTY OF YORK) This Poem IS PROUDLY AND GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR. Introduction. TO THE SOUL OF SIR WALTER SCOTT. Soul of the Last and Mightiest Of all the Minstrelsâbe thou blest! For that thou hast bequeathed to me A great and glorious Legacy, Such as no other single mindâ Save Shakspeare'sâever left behind! One, not of earth, or earth-born gold, In acres broad, or sums untold, Which may by heirs be wasted, may By lawless force be swept away, Or meanly filched by legal stealth; But a bequest of Mental Wealth! Left, not to me alone, although As much my own as if 'twere so; And yet, high thanks to art divine! As much the world's as it is mine; E'en like the air, or like the sun, Enjoyed by all, engrossed by none; Diffused, unspent; entire, though shared; All undiminished, unimpaired, Ordained to rouse emotions high, And charmâtill England's language die! O! when at first I saw the Tale Which tells of the redoubted Gael, Roderick Dhu. And of the bard Allan-Bane. whose harp would wake To soothe the Lady of the Lake, I did not read. That term were weak The process of the hour to speak. Page after page, thy words of flame To meâwithout a mediumâcame! The instant glanced at, glanced the whole Not on my sight, but on my soul! And, thus daguerreotyped, each line Will there remain while life is mine! I deemed that lay the sweetest far That ever sung of love and war; And vowed that, ere my dying day, I would attempt such lovely lay. But I was young, and had forgot How different were from thine, O Scott! My genius, and my earthly lot. What though my ear, in boyhood's time, Delighted, drank the flowing rhyme? Though then, like Pope, no fool to fame, âI lisped in numbers,â for they came, And waked, uncensured, unapproved, An echo of the strain I loved? And what though, in maturer days, With none to judge, and few to praise, Survived and ruled the impulse strong, And my heart lived and moved in song? Stillâpoor, unfriended, and untaught, A Cyclops in my Cave of Thought, Long sought I round, ere glimpse of day Consoled me with its entering ray. At length it came! and then I tried To wake my Harp in lonely pride. My Harp was made from stunted tree, The growth of Glendale's barest lea; Glendale, one of the minor divisons of the county of Northumberland, takes its name from the small stream of the Glen. Yet fresh as prouder stems it grew, And drank, with leaf as green, the dew; Bright showers, from Till or Beaumont shed, Its roots with needful moisture fed; Gay birds, Northumbrian skies that wing, Amid its branches loved to sing; And purple Cheviot's breezy air Kept up a life-like quivering there. From Harp, thence rudely framed and strung, Ah! how should strain like thine be flung? If, moved by young ambition's dream, I struck it to some lofty theme, All harshly jarred its tortured chords, As 'plaining such should be its lord's; But all its sweetness wakened still To lay of Northern stream or hill! To Craven's emerald dales transferred, That simple Harp with praise was heard. The manliest sons, the loveliest daughters, That flourish by the Aire's young waters, By gentle Ribble's verdant side, And by the Wharfe's impetuous tide, Lauded its strains. And for this cause, While throbs my breast to kind applauseâ Nay, when, beneath the turf laid low, No kind applause my breast can knowâ A Poet's blessing, heart-bequeathed, O'er the domains of Craven breathed, Shall be to every hill and plain Like vernal dew, or summer rain, And stay with her, while bud or bell Decks lowland mead, or upland fell! This, and the preceding paragraph, have already appeared in the Epistle to Gourley; but to have omitted them here, would have marred the Introduction. Thereâmindful still of theeâI strove To frame a lay of war and love. I roused old heroes from the urn; Bade buried monks to day return; And waked fair maids, whose dust had lain Ages in lead, to bloom again; My grateful wish to pour along Those emerald dales the charm of song, And do for Malham's Lake and Cave What thou hadst done for Katrine's wave. Not that the pride impelled me now That had inspired my youthful vow; I would but some like notes essay, Not rashly wake a rival lay! But years of gloom and strife came on; Dark omens girt the British Throne; The Disaffected and the Bad, Who hopes from wild commotion had, Gave towns to tumult and to flame, And treason wroughtâin William's name! That was no time, in idle lays, To kindle feuds of other daysâ I tuned my Harp to Order's cause, And sung for Britain's King and Laws! I trust that this will not be considered a too ostentatious allusion to a number of loyal and patriotic lyrics, which successively appeared in most of the leading journals of the day, and which, in their collected form, went through three editions. For party? Ay! but party then Was led by England's greatest menâ By Him, The Duke of Wellington. to save his country born By Him, The late Sir Robert Peel. whom all the people mourn; 'Twas graced by Stanley's Now the Earl of Derby. noble name, And vaunted that of âgallant Graeme.â Sir James Graham. Menâfar too high, too pure, too proud, To flatter either court or crowd; Menâmoved by patriotic zeal, And seeking nought but England's weal! Dull were the head could style the man Who followed them, a partisan. Far from thy Tweedâmy birth that claimsâ I find myself on regal Thames! The swans that Spenser loved to sing, Before me prune the snowy wing; In Surrey woods, by moonlight pale, I list to Thomson's nightingale; Thomson's fondness for the song of the nightingale is well known. He was in the habit of sitting at his open window half the summer night, entranced with its unrivalled music. The name of Collins, in my mind, is inseparably connected with that of Thomson, by his beautiful Elegy on the death of the latter. Use the same walks that Collins used, And muse, where Pope himself hath mused! I allude to Battersea, the lanes and walks of which must have been familiar to the great poet, from his frequent visits to the mansion of his friend, Lord Bolingbroke, at that place. What wonder if the wish, that burned So strong in youth, in age returned; Andâ'mid such scenesâmy Harp again Took up the long-abandoned strain? But ah! when of the high design Is traced at length the closing line, I say notâHow unlike to thine! (The forward child of youthful pride, That bold Presumption long hath died) ButâHow unlike to that which first On my enraptured Fancy burst, When, fresh and fair, my untried theme Roseâlike a landscape in a dream! That landscape hath familiar grown, And half of its romance is flown. Thus regions new, in distance seen, Have sunny vales of smoothest green, And mountains which, as they ascend, With the blue sky so softly blend, Thatâgiving nought of earth to viewâ They seem to be ethereal too! But, visited, the change is harsh; The vales that looked so smooth, are marsh; Brushwood and heath the hills array; And rock and quagmire bar the way! âYet round that marsh, who seek the vale, May violet find, or primrose pale; Yet on those hills, who choose to climb, May meet the crow-flower or the thyme; While e'en the rock for buds has room, And e'en the quagmire boasts its bloom! And, well I hope, that Northman ne'er Will lend a cold fastidious ear, To hear a Native Bard rehearse In the good old heroic verse, How, bold of heart and strong of hand, His Danish Fathers won Northumberland. CANTO I. I feel the sun!â the Aged Warrior said, His hand upon his Grandchild's shoulder laidâ A Stripling tall, whose locks of yellow shone In bright and beauteous contrast to his own, Which waved, amid that summer morning's glow, As purely white as Cheviot's drifted snow! âI feel the sun!â again the Warrior said, âSo, rest we, Harold, on this mountain's head, Whence thouânot I!âmayst cast thine eyes abroad, And see the beauty of the works of Godâ His Mountains wild, and his yet wilder Sea, Which lieth in its might so tranquilly, And wooeth with so soft a kiss the shore, As if it promised to be wild no more! Look to the rightâThou see'st the castled steep Of regal Bamborough beetle o'er the deep; See'st, far beneath, the sparkling waters play, As wins the tide on Waren's beauteous bay; And on the left, the Tower of Holy Isle Rise, like a rock of snow, in Morning's smile! 'Twas thus that rose the land, thus gleamed the wave, 'Twas thus that shone the sun, when Guthrum brave, Guthrum the Dane, from whom, with pride and joy, For ever trace thy princely line, my Boy! When Guthrum led his Danish fleet, well-manned, And drew up all his ships on yonder strand. 'Tis long ago. Men then, my son, were men! I was not blind, I was not feeble, then! Wouldst hear the Tale?â Young Harold smiled. He knew The threatened Tale, but liked to hear it too; And had, besides, a generous wish to please Much-talking Age in its infirmities. He therefore answered with a prompt assent; When, gratified, his back the Warrior leant, Beside the Youth, against a mossy stone That cairned the mountain which they sat upon; And while, with cheek now slightly flushed, now pale, And voice that often changed, he told his Tale, There needed not the Harp. That warlike hand Could once the sword, but ne'er the harp command; And therefore not like Minstrel, but like One By whom bold deeds had often, erst, been done, He, as he felt it, poured his varying theme, And was the Bard, he would have scorned to seem! I. A hundred ships, my son, with mast and sail, Had caught the impulse of the eastern gale; In every ship, a score of rowers brave Had backward bent their oars to brush the wave; When Guthrum's vessel gave the parting sign, And led herself the way across the brine. The tallest as the first, her dragon-form The soldiers of each fleet obeyed in general one chief, whose vessel was distinguished from the rest. He could guide his vessel as the good horseman his steed; he was initiated in the science of the runes; he knew the mystic characters which, engraved upon swords, secured the victory, and those which, inscribed on the poop and on the oars, preserved vessels from shipwreck.âThierry's Norman Conquest.âThe name of the Danish leader is variously speltâGuthrum, Guthrun, Godrun. I am reminded by my friend Mr. Pollard, of the Audit Office, that there is a street in York which still retains his name, being called Guthrum-Gate. Had, scathless, weathered many a wreekful storm; For all along her sides, from stem to stern, The mystic words might every eye discern, Which held within their characters a charm, Of power the wildest tempest to disarm! Her mast was fashioned of the roan-tree; The roan-tree, or mountain ash, was deemed an infallible charm against the power of demons. In the old Ballad of âThe Laidley Worm,â Childe Wynde's ship had a âmast of rowan-tree.â Her canvas had been wove by Sisters Three, Who, as their flying shuttles led the woof, With magic songs had made it wizard-proof! From the same hands, to Guthrum's safety true, Had come the flag that at the mast-head flew, On whose white fold there soared the Raven Black, The Danes, on landing, unfurled a mystic standard. It was a flag of white silk, in the centre of which appeared the black figure of a Raven, with open beak and outspread wings; three of King Swen's sisters had worked it in one night, accompanying their labour with magic songs and gestures. It was supposed to indicate, by its motions, the direction in which a successful adventure might be made.â Thierry's Norman Conquest. Empowered to scent the prey and point the trackâ At least, obedient to our Northern creed, We boldly followed where he seemed to lead! II. The weapons used in war on deck were storedâ Their offensive weapons were commonly the bow and arrows, the battleaxe, and the sword. Of their defensive armour, the shield or buckler was the chief. This most commonly was of wood, bark, or leather. It was generally of a long oval form, just the height of the bearer. It was not without its use even in naval encounters; for if the fear of falling into their enemies's hands obliged one of the warriors to cast himself into the sea, he could easily escape by swimming upon his buckler.âMallet's Northern Antiquities. The lance, the bow, the battleaxe, the sword; While, as the bearers tall, and framed of wood, Lashed side by side, the shields around it stoodâ Ever, in case of accident, at hand, Our floats in water, as our guards on land. Bright lay each steel-blade, bright each burnished hilt, With Saxon blood so shortly to be gilt, In no obscure encounterâsince there came Two Scalds with us, to give each fight to fame; They (the poets) were more especially honoured and carressed at the courts of those princes, who distinguished themselves by their great actions and passion for glory. Such princes never set out on any considerable expedition without some of them in their train.âIbid. Anlave and Rolfe their names, on Danish ground For ready eloquence of song renowned. Alas, to song no more they lend their breath, But calmly slumber in the arms of death, Their very names forgot, their strains divine Erased from every memory but mine, Which treasures parts of themâalthough it ought, Perchance, to treasure things more worthy thought! III. We sailed from Denmark. Thenceforth, never more Was eye of Aymund to behold that shore, Which faded from my last and lingering lookâ For with strange sadness leave of it I took! Night fell, morn rose; and still our onward way We made through breaking mist and dashing spray. Night fell, morn rose: and, as before, we found But sky above us, and but sea around. The third night came, and brought a timely blast, Which sped our vessels forward. And at lastâ IV. Through parting clouds of crimson and of gold, Through flying mists of white, transparent fold, Like some young Monarch from his curtained sleep, Arose the Sun from out the shining Deep! He glanced upon our fleet, and, glancing, showed The spacious bay near which our vessels rodeâ Here Bamborough Castle caught his earliest smile; The venerable remains of the celebrated fortress of Bamborough Castle stand on the crown of a high rock, triangular in figure, one of the points projecting into the German Ocean. Holy Island, or more properly Lindisfarne, which is situated a few miles north of Bamborough, is called by Bede a semi-island, being twice an island and twice a continent in one day; for at the flowing of the tide, it is encompassed by water; and at the ebb, there is an almost dry passage to and from the mainland. St. Aidan was the founder of the Monastery. âHistory of Northumberland. There caught it, too, the Tower of Holy Isle; While the wild Cheviotsâdistantâto the ray, As if less distant, reared their summits gray. Fair and familiar sight! For oft, before, Our ships had rested on that goodly shore, And oft had thence retraced the foaming flood Laden with spoilâachieved by blows and blood! And blood, we knew, was soon again to flow, Spoil to be won, 'mid wailing and 'mid woe; But that good fleet was destined ne'er again, For Denmark's shore, to cross the bounding main! V. I sailed with Guthrum; ever at his side As kinsman owned, and as a warrior tried; To ask whose counsel he would often bend, And whom he blushed not to proclaim his friend. By my advice, a feint that morn was madeâ As if we feared the shore we would invade, Our fleet to seaward bore from Waren's bay, Nor neared the Island till had waned the day. Then, while the vesper bell in distance rung, We moored our vessels, and to shore we sprungâ A hundred men, selected from the fleet, Inured each peril fearlessly to meet; Guthrum himself, with falchion in his hand, The first to leap upon the Island-strand; Nor deem, of all the hundred warriors brave, Thy Grandsire was the last to quit the wave! VI. We sought the Conventânot, be sure, that we Would in its shade do rite of piety! For we were Danes that held the Northern Faith, And deemed that wreaking every structure scathe, Whate'er its name, in which were wont convene The hated followers of the Nazarene, At any risk, against uncounted odds, Was for the honour of our country's gods. Instructed thus from infancy to feel, Each had the stimulant of fiery zeal, Which nerved his arm, and gave, amid the fight, To deeds of blackest dye the hue of right. Yet nathless, son, the firm belief is mine, Had they not been aware how rich the shrine Of good St. Aidan of the Holy Isle, The pious Founder of the sacred pileâ Their zeal would scarce have brought our warriors o'er To bootless battle on the Saxon shore! VII. Full gloomily against the western skies, Still faintly tinged with sunset's lingering dyes, The Convent rose. Within, we heard a crowd Of devotees at worship, low, or loud. Our savage war-cry, and our weapon-clash, Our in-burstâsudden as the lightning's flash, And far more startlingâchecked the course at once Of the low mutter, and the loud response, And dread, well-founded, of a fierce assault Sent shrieks, instead, along each cchoing vault. The bald and black-robed Brothers of the Rood, With little dignity, in haste made good Their present safetyâall escaped but One, And he stood up beside the altar stone, Defiant, calm. He, doubtless, wished to claim The envied glory of a Martyr's name, And had his wish! To no man need I tell What happed where Guthrum's deadly falchion fell! We saw the fresh blood dim its azure shine; We saw his victor hand upon the shrine; And dreamed but of dividing soon the spoil, Obtained at little risk, with little toil; When menânot in the black array of monkâ Menâwho had, at our entrance, backward slunk, So seemed it, to the aisle's obscure recessâ Returned to light with looks of haughtiness, And all so fully armed, as well, I ween, To vindicate the proud change of their mien! A chosen band they were of Saxons stern, As, at deep cost, 'twas shortly ours to learn, There by the Monks maintained, on duty hardâ The precious trcasures of the House to guard. VIII. And now, my son, I wot thy youthful ear Is keenly bent a Tale of Blood to hear. And Iâwho lately heaved a sigh, to know We sat with scenes so beautiful below, And all those beauteous scenes of land and sea, One mournful, one unpeopled blank to meâ I, by the very loss of sight, have more Of power the scene, long vanished, to restore The Present now is nothing, Harold,âbut, Not so from me the busy Past is shut. I miss, indeed, the common outward day, But have, within my soul, a clearer ray, In which, whate'erâin long departed yearsâ I saw, or acted, often re-appears, And not, now, faint and dimâas when the shine Of all the bright external world was mineâ But bold and brilliant, placed in real light, And less, in truth, a Memory than a Sight! IX. 'Tis thus, e'en now, I see that place of doom, With its light fading till it ends in gloom. I see the savage figures moving there, As fiercely they emerge from gloom to glareâ Emerge in numbers more than matching those To whom this evening finds, or makes, them foes. I see th' astonished Danes; my gaze I turn To where the lustres of the altar burnâ There Guthrum, sternly poising his red brand, To fierce encounter animates his band; Points to the fresh stain, as an omen sure Of that which every foe must soon endure; And is himself the very first to give The stroke, which no man can receive and live! A shoutâin which stern Valour's heart is heardâ Shakes the vast fane, as if by earthquake stirred; An answering shout return the Saxon foes, And the two lines in deadly conflict close! X. Few men, perhaps, there be, who will maintain That bolder is the Saxon than the Dane; As few there are who will the converse hold, And say the Dane is more than Saxon bold. Once adverse races, on one soil they blend, And, brave alike, no more in arms contend, Except when, marshalled 'gainst a common foe, They strive which first shall deal the victor blow. 'Tis plain, my son, when such in combat stand, That numbers must the strife's event command. Though Guthrum's falchion taught, at every wheel, Some luckless foe the temper of its steel; And though his gallant band, with equal skill, And equal prowess, worked his eager will; 'Twas soon a certainty, that in the fray The Danish force fell all too fast away. As was my wont, I fought at Guthrum's side, And marked his visage as our loss he eyed. âO'ermatched,â he said, âand barred from all retreat, No hope remains to us but from the fleet. Go, signal them. No words, my friendâbut fly!â For thus to leave him, loath, be sure, was I. Besides, an errand which I deemed so safe, A youthful warrior's mood might fairly chafe. Reluctantly, with ill-dissembled wrath, I went; but found that not so safe the path As I had deemed it. At the portal stood Armed men to bar my exitâwon with blood, Theirs and my own!âI quickly reached the strand, And gave the signal. Fast they leaped to land; And of our men, at least two hundred more Soon stood, in arms, along the silent shoreâ All glad to quit the ships, and drowsy sea, All proud to rescue, or to die, with me! XI. We marchedâbut had not from the beach gone far, When lo! betwixt us and the western star, A column of red light to heaven arose, Lit, as it seemed to me, by Saxon foes, A beacon on some neigh bouring hill-topâmeant To warn the Mainland of our night-descent. But as, with rapid steps, we onward came, I soon perceived it was no beacon-flame, But of some dread catastrophe the proofâ 'Twas bursting, Harold, from the Convent's roof! And ever, as our footsteps nearer drew, The red flame brighterâbroaderâgranderâgrew, Till, in its far-shed splendour, visible lay The Isle, the shore, the vessels, and the bay! I saw the huge pile being thus consumed, And inly saidââIs Guthrum there entombed?â The thought was maddening! and at once I lost Power o'er myself, forgot awhile my post, And, acting most unlike a leader sage, Ran forthâimpelled by sorrow and by rage, Ran forth, alone, with brimful heart and eye, And burning to avenge him or to die! Again I hurried to the postern door, Whence I had cut my way not long before. The guards were dead; but out a blast there broke, Full in my face, of mingled fire and smoke! 'Twas with a sinking heart I backward drew; For I believed its dark foreboding true, And that beneath the rapid flames had quailed Alike the brave Assailants and th' Assailed! And Guthrumâheâmy generous Princeâmy friend! But could such hero thus have met his end? The doubt inspired a hope. With lightened mind, I turned away, the Convent's front to find; And gaining that, with pleasure I perceived My frantic error had been well retrieved. I heard my followers, heard their measured tread; Next moment, I was marching at their head; Another, and my voice the order gave With me to enterâto avenge, or save! XII. But scarcely had the order been addressed, Whenâlike a torrent between rocks compressed, Which toils and struggles, for a time in vain, Free course and outlet for its waves to gainâ Along the vaulted passage to the door I saw the tide of conflict wildly pour; Pour with the torrent's rage, the torrent's din, Its motions reddened by the blaze within! The Danes came first; but, coming, backward stepped, And still their pressing foe at sword-point kept, And when at last they gained the outer space, Formed, and still met them bravely, face to face, Receding, but with step deliberate, slow, And with strong arm returning blow for blow. I saw my Guthrum, firm and undismayed, Wielding, with scarce less might, his battle-blade, And though with force diminished, cheering on His menâwhen Hope itself was all but gone. Brave heart! he dreamed not of the strength at hand That now made victors of his gallant band; For wearied, as they were, by lengthened fight, And daunted by th' approach of unworn might, It needed little but our onset-shout, To put the Saxon remnant to the rout. Scarcely pursued, the guardians fled apace, And left the Danes the masters of a place In which the Fire-Fiend held his burning throne, And wielded there a power that dwarfed our own! XIII. Guthrum approached me now, with sheathÃ¨d brand, Expressed a warrior's thanks, and grasped my hand; And scarce his gratitude had ceased to speak, When all were startled by a piercing shriek; But whence it came we knew not. One averred It was some suffocating wretch we heard, Who, left upon the bloody floor to die, Had given his death-pang utterance in that cry! Surmised another that, in sorrow drowned, The Fathers walked the burning walls around, And one of them might, haplyâin that brief And fearful outburstâhave expressed his grief. But I had caught with more experienced ear, The source and meaning of that sound of fear. I knew the voice was Woman's! And I knew, If half that I had heard of monks was true, To find within a Convent's hallowed wall A lovely damosel, were marvel small. But no light fancy, in that awful hour, Held o'er my bosom e'en a moment's power; Nought but that instinctâhuman life to saveâ Which moves the basest, but commands the brave. Along the portion yet unfired, I ran, Ear bent to listen, eye awake to scan; But sight or sound of life, alas! was none, Save one distracted Monkâand only one. XIV. I found the Father in the open air, Engaged in weeping, and, it seemed, in prayer; And more by gesture than by means of speech, Him I contrived, at length, my quest to teach. 'Wildered at first the old man's looks had been, But soon they bore the marks of anguish keen, As if some object, near and dear, within, Were perishing through his, the Father's sin! He motionedâfor it now was mine, in turn, The old man's meaning by his signs to learnâ And straightway led me to a secret door, By evergreens and shrubbery covered o'er. He took my hand, and, darkly entering there, We clombe what seemed a steep and spiral stair, And when we had attained the highest round, We paused, until a massive door he found. That opened, from the cell a dim light broke, Through the close air, and haze of searching smoke. A single glance sufficed to prove the Monk A faithful guide. Upon the cell-floor sunk, A female form lay here, as if in death; And there, without a movement or a breath, Her cheek against the flashing lattice laidâ Half stood, and half reclined, another maid. Like marble bust, the latter leaned in light, As still, as beauteous, and, in truth, as white! To raise them both, and both at once to bear Down the dark windings of the same steep stair, And into the fresh breeze of night at lengthâ But little tasked my early manhood's strength. To place them on the greensward, far away From the flame's risk, and yet within its ray, That the good Father might employ his skill Sense to restoreâwas task more easy still. O'er them I stood, and blessed the welcome blaze That gave, by fits, the Rescued to my gaze! XV. A Maiden born to rank of high degree, Her costly garments showed the one to be; The other's neat simplicity of dress Might her poor Follower's lowly state express. When breathed on by the air, the latter soon Recovered from her deep and death-like swoon; 'Twas somewhat longer, ere the Lady broke The fetter of the trance, and slowly woke. At length, my son, I saw returning lifeâ Scarce yet triumphant in the dubious strifeâ Returning colour gradually shed Through the cheek's whitenessâlike the dawning's red Gleaming through mist-wreaths! and I saw her eye Fair open on meâlike the azure sky Of morning, when the Morning Star beams throughâ The seeming spirit of the kindling blue! Harold, that was a moment richly worth All the best moments I had passed on earth! There are who tell us that true love requires Time and sweet intercourse to fan its fires; Then love, my son, was not my passion's name, Which, in an instant, blazed from spark to flame! That eyeâI feltâthat heavenly eye to me Thenceforth my Blessing or my Blight must be! The Star whichâo'er my ocean beaming brightâ To wreck must lure me, or to rapture light! XVI. From such emotions, new to me and strange, I found my spirit lapse with sudden change. As life in her resumed its wonted sway, It ebbed from meâor seemed to ebbâaway. My wound, unfelt while yet my blood was hot, And since, if felt at all, regarded not, Had, from the very moment it was ta'en, Been stealing life with slow, but ceaseless, drain. And now my head grew light; I fell to ground; The sky, with all its rushing stars, went round, And whirled to utter darkness! As I sunk, I had some glimpses of the black-robed Monk, And eke a vague impression of a new And numerous force of enemies in view. The last remembered sounds my ear conveyed, Were those of onslaught furiously made. Then seemed it me, that people gathered round, Who softly touched, and raised me from the ground; Gently they raised me, tenderly they bore Awayâaway. I heard and felt no more. CANTO II. I. My whomâor whitherâI was borne away; How long devoid of consciousness I lay; And where I was, when feeling's light again Came back into the chambers of my brain; Were mysteries! and no living creature by, Appeared to give to questioning reply. Nathless, I did not feel abandoned all: The light that glimmered through the lattice small, Made me, by slow degrees indeed, aware Of some one's rude, but not unkindly, care. True, I was in a rustic hut; I saw The walls were built of turf, the roof was straw; And yet not comfortless its aspect seemedâ Piled on the hearth, a fire of branches gleamed; And my low couch, of mountain heather made, Was softly strown, and had been freshly laid; While various skins, with all their shaggy hair, Spread o'er it, fenced me from each blast of air. The garb that I had worn, was near me flung; The sword that I had wielded, safely hung; My wound, too, as I shortly after found, By skilful leech-craft had been dressed and bound. And all were tokens that appeared to show I was, at least, not treated like a foe. II. But where then was I? Was I bound or free? I started from my lowly couch to see. A thoughtless act! which scarce allowed me time To gaze on mountains, wild, and white with rime, And on a frost-fog, which was curling then Up to the brilliant sunshine from the glenâ For Spring, although arrived, was timid still, And scared by Winter from his yet-claimed hill. Of that wild scene brief glimpse did I obtain, When darkness fell once more upon my brain, And in this second trance, if minutes flew, If hours, or days, went byâI nothing knew. I woke again, awoke all faint and weak, Dreaming I heard soft voices near me speak! I listened, gently oped the hut's sole door; And a sweet Vision graced the sunny floor. III. Before me stood a Maiden, young and fair, With bright-black eyes, and eke with bright-black hair; With cheeks that bore the heath-bell's softest tint, And lips where Love might purest kiss imprint! Her graceful figureâneither low nor tallâ Was something slender, yet was full withal. Such ever may be seen, fresh, blooming, sweet, When at the dance the village damsels meet; Such ever reap, in harvest's merry tide, The yellow fields that smile by fair Tweedside! But something sweeter in that Maiden's face, Than e'en its nameless charm and native grace, I saw, and prized. It was the kind concern, The doubtful, anxious glance, that sought to learn Whether the change, which now in me appeared, Was that she hoped for, or was that she feared. From those sweet signs, I then, and rightly, guessed This Maid had been the Watcher o'er my rest, To whom, since that wild night of flame and strife, I doubtless owed that I was still in life; And, deeply grateful for so kind a part, I would have uttered what I felt at heart; But she, with finger pressed upon her lip, Forbade me; and away I saw her trip. A shadow seemed on all things round to fall, When she withdrew; but light came back to all With her return! And soon the Maiden brought, With smiles, the medicine which the Leech had sought (As afterwards she often used to tell) On moor and moss, by river and by fellâ A precious compound! which, his science told, Infused new blood, or purified the old. IV. New bloodâat least new strengthâthere daily came, By felt degrees, into my languid frame; But well I weened the strength or blood, conveyed, Less from the Medicine came, than from the Maid, From whose bright aspect and demeanour kind, A light began to dawn upon my mindâ A light by which my fancy had full scope To frame the visions ever dear to Hope! That evening's strange adventures I recalled, When, more than foemen, had the flames appalled, The fightâthe rescueâand at last the gaze On those fair features brightened by the blazeâ Until the moment when on earth I sunk, Exhausted, down beside the black-robed Monk. âIf,â thus I tried to reason, âI had been, By my own friends, borne senseless from the scene, They would have doubtless borne me to the strand, Nor left their Leader on a hostile landâ I should not in a stranger's hut have lain, But in my vessel, and upon the main. Or ifâprovoked by holy treasure lostâ Guthrum had inland led his Danish host, And brought me with him,âwould my Guthrum not Ere this, have visited his kinsman's cot?â 'Twas mystery all!âI then recalled the sight Of the fresh warriors that renewed the fight: âThose warriors must have Saxon been, and who Can prove to me they were not victors too? But if they were, then whenceâI fain would knowâ Sprung all this care of me, their deadly foe? Delicious, but O most presumptuous thought! Had that fair Lady's intercession wrought In my behalf? And do Iâcan I err? This was the Maiden I had saved with her!â V. Impatience all, the truth to ascertain, I would have tried my power of speech again, But, as before, the Maiden's finger-tip, Imposing silence; pressed her rosy lip. My Danish ire was roused. The Maid perceived The angry feeling, and, I saw, was grieved. She gently pressed my hand, she did not speak, Save by a tear that trickled down her cheek! On this my heart my conduct 'gan upbraidâ âWretch! this poor girl may be a Saxon Maid, And if she is of Saxon lineage sprung, How should she comprehend thy Danish tongue?â There can be no doubt that the Saxon and Danish tongues were originally similar, or the same. But when it is remembered that some four hundred years had elapsed from the time of the Saxons being settled in England, to the invasion of that country by the Danes, it will, I think, be admitted that sufficient changes would in the interim have taken place in both dialects, to render unintelligibleâor nearly soâ a Dane to a Saxon, and vice versa The present dialect of Yorkshire, for instance, is essentially the same that is now spoken in the county of Northumberland; and yet so differently are the same words pronounced in those partsrespectively, thata Northumbrian has considerable difficulty to understand a Yorkshireman who speaks his native patois in its purity. I begged the Maid's forgiveness with mine eye, And the sweet girl forgave meâwith a sigh! VI. I smiledâand yet was deeply vexedâto think No power I had to seize a single link Of that chain, whose unwinding was to guide My future steps to ruin or a bride, Unless my young attendant first could teach Her invalid the use of Saxon speech, Or I initiate that attendant young Into the mysteries of the Danish tongue; And either, Harold, seemed to me a feat Less easy than a host, in arms, to meet. Judge then my wonder, and conceive my joy, To hear the Maiden Danish terms employ! Imperfect, it is true, but O how dear The unexpected accents to my ear! VII. âThe Leech's charge was strict,â the Maiden said, âThat I should keep thee quiet, and in bed, From aught that might awake emotion deep, In one whose only need is rest and sleep. And I, obedient to his uttered will, Have kept thee so, and so would keep thee still. But thou didst save me! thine the daring hand That from the very burning plucked the brand! And God, who died for us upon the tree, (The Maiden crossed herself) my witness be! I would do aught, so that it harm thee not, Do aught to soothe or cheer thy hapless lot! Assured that, do for thee whate'er I may, I never can that gallant deed repay. VIII. âTo tell, e'en now, in thine impatient ear, The narrative that thou wouldst gladly hear, To me were task most sweet! But of the tale A part, at least, I've sworn from thee to veil; And thou, in turn, must pledge to me thy troth, Never to tempt me from my taken oath.â âI willâI doâby Woden!â I replied. âOh, thou art Pagan still,â she said, and sighed. âThat Woden was, I know, my father's god, Until upon our English soil he trod, Where he imbibed the beautiful, the good, The pure religion of the blessÃ¨d Rood.â âThy sire was, then, a Danish man?â I said. âHe was; and I am half a Danish maid! Like thee, my tather crossed the bounding main, In quest of glory, and, no doubt, of gain But being taken in a skirmish, he Was here detained in sad captivityâ To which, in lapse of time, grown reconciled, He wedded, and you see his single child, Who, certes, little thought, when oft she hung, In playful girlhood, on her father's tongue, That the few words her young attention caught, Would ever serve a Danish Captive aught.â IX. âI am a Captive then?â âAlas, thou art! And bitter, truly, is the Captive's part. But touch not that forbidden theme! Enough; At least thy gaoler is not stern or rough.â âKind gaoler thou! May not thy Captive claim To know his young and lovely gaoler's name?â âThey call me Bertha,â quickly answered she; âMy father chose the name, and gave it me, Because 'twas that his aged mother bore, Who pined away, for him, on Denmark's shore.â âThen, dearest Bertha, not to touch thy vow, O tell me all thou canstâand tell it now!â The Maiden seated her my couch beside, And kindly thus with my request complied. X. âAsk not of me the rank, or e'en the name, Of her you rescued from the Convent's flame; Let it suffice thee, if I say, in brief, She claims some kindred with the Earl or Chief, Who, underneath King Alfred's high command, Now rules the kingdom of Northumberlandâ Important charge! which, stretching many a league, Demands incessant action and fatigue. Warriors the vigil and the march may bear, But ill they suit the delicate and fair. This felt the Earl, and often had he tried A place of rest and safety to provide; And so alas! it chanced, we came the while Nigh to the Convent of the Holy Isle; Which seemed to promise, with its ample guard, A brief asylum for his lovely Ward. He took us thither in a luckless hour; He saw us placed in fair and fitting bower; But in the Convent he short space remained; The monks scarce knew the gentle guest they gained; One only learned the Lady's rank, and he Was the good Abbotâwhom I saw with thee. XI. âThe Chief of us had taken hasty leave; The Convent bell had tolled the hour of eve; The eve was slowly fading into night; And we sat, pensive, by our lonely light; When rose that mingled sound, whose import dread Our conscious hearts at once interpretedâ For often had we listened to, ere then, The fearful clangour of encountering men, To which no ear hath ever listened yet, That can mistake it, or that will forget! High-born and proud, the Lady bent to hear With more by far of wonder than of fear; In undisguised alarm I held my breath, And drank in every tone that told of death! I've heard of men, on whom the watching snake Had fixed a bright eye from the forest brake, Who thereby have been drawnâalluredâcompelledâ T' approach the object, though with dread beheld. E'en thus I felt me drawn, by mortal fear, To look on that which scarce I bore to hear. I sawâI hardly gazed, for what I saw, With shriek on shriek, compelled me to withdraw! I single light beside a column burnedâ That in my hasty flight I overturned, Nor paused to notice if the falling flame, In its descent, extinct or not became. Alas! that oversight was error dire, Which gaveâwho knows?âthe Convent up to fire. XII. âThe Lady's cell regained, what I had seen, At once she read in my distracted mien; And having lost all power of utterance, I, By silent signs, implored her thence to fly. But all my efforts were in vain, until Thick, smouldering smoke began the place to fill; Whenâall too lateâto make escape we tried, Descending stair, and threading passage wide. O God! the passage into which we came, Blazed fiercely with impenetrable flame! Then sank at last the strength which seemed divine, And left her spirit's nerve as weak as mine. Backward she rushed, her cell again to seek, And spoke her terror in one long, loud shriek. O! all to me is blank. that shriek between, And my awakening on the Abbey Green.â XIII. âBut thenâwhat followed then?â I wildly cried, Mad with impatience. âO be calm!â replied The Maid, âor I must stop. The skilful leechââ âO tell me not of him! Resume thy speech!â âI marked thy sudden fall; I thought thee dead; I saw the Abbot hold thy drooping head; I heard the moan my gentle Lady gave, As forth she falteredââSave his life! O save!â âDid she?â I inly cried, with bounding soul; But on my tongue I kept a firm control. â'Twas then, among the band of Danish foes, A sudden clamour and commotion rose; A hasty battle-line I saw them form, As if preparing for a coming storm; And pressing, certes, soon appeared the need Of all their preparation and its speed! âThe Chief, arrested by the flaming pile, Had, fearing for his Ward, regained the Isle; And he it was who, with a numerous train, Had now arrived before the burning fane. At once his martial band their weapons drew, And on the Danes with headlong fury flew. Tinged by the blaze, the struggling warriors then To me seemed more like demons than like men! XIV. âThy countrymen gave way. Forgive, if I Confess the truth, that then, without a sigh, I saw thy Danish friends, man after man, O'ertaken and cut down, as forth they ran. The Moon now rose above the silver sea, And, all betwixt her broad, bright orb and me, I saw dark figuresâstrugglingâstrikingâurge Pursuit and vengeance to the ocean's verge! I heardâor deemed I heardâthe plunge and moan Of hapless men into the waters thrown, And the exulting cry that came from those Who had regained their ships in spite of foes! Then all grew hushed. Each loosened sail, outspread, Caught from the dying flames their faintest red, Caught from the risen Moon her softest whiteâ And the fleet calmly sailed away in light!ââ âThen some, at least, survive the fatal day,â I inly reasoned, âand my Guthrum may. But why not signal give with voice, or hand, And call fresh numbers to assist his band? And wherefore sprung not these, uncalled, ashore, To check the slaughter, if they could no more? Doubtless, because the spoil for which they came, All knew, had perished in the Convent's flame, And nothing, now, remained for men to do, Who fight for glory, but for booty too!â XV. The Maid resumed: âBack came the victor Chief, And, touching thee, to us put question brief. The Lady's answer was so softly made, I could but guess the meaning it conveyed, By what thereto succeeded. As she spoke, He from his shoulders stripped his martial cloak, And four, the stoutest of his train, he told To place thee softly in its ample fold, And bear thee forth. It chanced that then a Dane, Who in the combat had been captive ta'en, Was brought into his presence. Him he bade Thy visage note. Downcast at first, and sad, I saw the man extreme surprise evince To recognise his dead, or dying Prince! For so the captive styled thee. I perceived The Chief was not by this discovery grieved; But rather seemed it me that, after this, With more of energy and emphasis, The Earl commanded his attendants there To treat their noble charge with gentlest care, And restingâwhen and where was needâan hour, To bring thee safely to his Mountain Tower, Where, placed in hut from noise and tumult free, Bertha, he added, should attend on thee. âMy simple tale is done. Here thou hast lain, For days and days, delirium in thy brain! But thanks to Holy Mary, mother mild, Who hath, in answer to her asking child, Restored to thee, in part at least, thy healthâ A blissful change! to Bertha more than wealth!â XVI. The kindly Maiden, pausing, dropped a tear; And if, in then returning thanks sincere, My harder eye was wet,âthou mayst believe, I did not Harold, therefore blush or grieve! âAm I, then, near the Chieftain's mountain hold?â âThou art,â she answered, âand I might have told That scarcely ever passed a day, but he Or came himself, or sent, to hear of thee, Till called away by other cares, which still Detain his footsteps from this Northern hill. And She thou lovestâpr'ythee, do not start! The humble Bertha knows thy inmost heart; Its throbs she heard, its every thought she read, When daily watching by thy fevered bed; And soothly knows she, but none else will tell, Thou lovest her!âI would that half so well Some one loved Bertha!ââ(This the simple Maid Said playfully, yet somewhat sadly said)â âShe too hath often come, hath watched with me, And, wondering, listened to thy reverie, But little understood it.â âThen,â I said, âThose visits kind may still, perchance, be paid, And how to her shall I my mind make known, Who can no language speak, except my own? I have it! Bertha shall my teacher be; The Saxon language I will learn from thee; And if it give to every tone of mine But half the magic which it gains from thine, Bertha! who knows, but I in time may woo A Saxon Maiden, and may win her too, As did thy sire?â The blushing Maid's reply To this, was prefaced with a deeper sigh; But instantly, as by an effort, she Resumed her wonted, native gaiety. XVII. âIf thou art apt,â she archly said, âmy skill Shall quickly find thee words to use at will; For well and sooth our Saxon proverbs teachâ âWomen have never any lack of specch.â Besides, I've often heard my father tell That the far country where, it seems, you dwell, Is neigh bour toâif it be not the same As that from which, at first, the Saxons came. And hence, he would go on, of many a word The sense and sound, in both tongues, so accord, That Dane or Saxon very soon may know, And speak, the kindred language of his foe.â âThen, Bertha,â cried I, âwe will that amend, Since I shall learn it, not of foe, but friend!â XVIII. I found it as the Maiden's sire had saidâ A common origin the tongues displayed; Alike in both the trunk, the same the roots, They varied only in the spreading shoots. And such the Teacher's, such the Pupil's zeal, Ere many suns were o'er us found to steal, I had the pleasure, and received the praise, Of mastering many a Saxon word and phrase. Sweet teachings those! that lowly hut our home, I seldom had a wish or thought to roam; Though when my wound permitted me to stir, I gladly walked along the hills with her, And learned, by other sounds, or words, to name Whate'er within our scope of vision came. CANTO III. I. Spring was full Queenâher beautiful domain Comprising mountain now, as well as plain. âBertha and I stood on that green hill-side, Where stood the cottage, one sweet morning tide, And gazed with pleasure on a hundred hillsâ The nearest green, and streaked with glittering rills; The farther distant bleak, of wilder forms, And trenched and furrowed by a thousand storms; While One, that towered on high above the rest, Had a deep gash upon its ample breast, In which a wreath of lingering snow still shoneâ The single relic of the winter gone! Which seemed, in my desponding moods, to be Left by its false, or happier friendsâlike meâ Conspicuous, lying there day after day, And slowly wasting, in its place, away! Fair were those hills, and still they looked sublime, Although no longer in the garb of rime; Fair were those glens, that deeply wound below, Still whiteâbut white with daisies, not with snow; And fair those streams, that lay as smooth as glass, Reflecting banks of broom, and hills of grass! II. âThese Mountains wild,â began the Maiden, âclaim, Each for itself, a separate local name. We stand on Lanton Hill. Not far behind, The verdant Howsden woos the summer wind. That mountain, with its three wild peaks, before, Is styled by dwellers near it, Newton Torr. Tho oak-clad ridges, there, of Akeld swell, And here, the softer slopes of Yevering Bell. While towering, yonder, with his patch of snow, And proudly overlooking all below, Is Cheviot's mighty self, his throne who fillsâ Th' admitted Monarch of Northumbrian hills! âTwo streams you see, one winding still and clear, The other hastening on its wild career, As glad yon deep and sunless glen to missâ The College that we call, the Beaumont this. Beneath that clump of trees they meet, and then Their mingled waters take the name of Glenâ A humble stream! which yet to pious fame Is not without its pure and gentle claim. For men relate, that when the Gospel-beam Began at first across the land to stream, A hundred Saxon converts, in one day, Washed in its tide their crimson sins away; While angel-bands, revealed to mortal sight, From cloud and mountain watched the sacred rite! Paulinus coming with the king and queen into a manor or house of the king's, called Ad-Gebrin, now Yevering, abode with them thirty-six days, employed wholly in catechising and baptising; during which time he did nothing from morning to evening but instruct the people in the saving word of Christ; and being thus instructed, he baptised them to the forgiveness of their sins, in the river Glen, which was hard by.âHistory of Northumberland. III. âOn Glen's fair bank stands Coupland's massive Towerâ I am not prepared to prove that Coupland Castle, now the property of M. T. Culley, Esq., existed at the period of the poem, or that it ever had so illustrious an occupant as I have imagined for it. This is a work of fiction, and, with the exception of two or three leading points, pretends not to historical accuracy. Yonder you see its darksome turrets lour! There makes the Chief, when in the North, his stay. And mark you not yon modest structure gray? It is an ancient âchurch.â Around it wave Green yews on many a peasant's lowly âgraveââ So call we man's last resting-place, the still And certain refuge from all earthly ill! The graceful shrubs thatâtall, and close, and rankâ Extend along the Beaumont's northern bank, And gaily clothe it with their yellow bloomâ These graceful shrubs are, in our language, âbroom.â This plant, of many branches on a stem, And each branch crested with a purple gem, Which, armed and plumÃ¨d, like a Warrior standsâ We call a âthistle.â This the tenderest hands May grasp, although its shape and colour strike As being to the others not unlike. It hath no name I wot of; but, above The rest, it should be styled âThe flower of loveâ; For 'tis to it the wondrous spells belong, Which thus some bard hath worked into a song: IV. Song. THE FLOWER OF LOVE. Young Wadda, on a summer's eve, The maid he long had wooed, addressed: âSee! I these flowers of bloom bereave, And put them underneath my vest. The first shall bear thy name, 'tis meet; The other that of Edith Bain! And wont the morning, love, be sweet, That sees one relic bud again?â They partedâas young lovers part, With many a last good night and kiss; And each went home, with lightened heart, To dream a dream of love and bliss. Yet her heart was not happy quite; She pondered on those flowerets twain; And oft the maiden said, that night, âO! which of them will bud again?â Next morning to her cot he hied: âCome, guess on which the bloom's begun!â âI nothing care,â she archly cried, So Edith Bain's be not the one!â He caught her in his arms. âWe meet, Life-wedded by this token plain! And is not, love, the morning sweet, That sees the relic bud again?â V. The Maiden, having sung her simple lay, Two flowers selected; cut the bloom away; Then bade me place them âunderneath my vest,â To represent the two I loved the best. âI know,â she said, âthe favourite of âthe twain.â But have a doubt that that will âbud again!â But to my task.â She stooped, and hand and foot Employed to pluck a wilding from the rootâ âThis is the âmountain fern,â of which they say This tradition respecting the fern is still current among the peasantry of the district in which the scene is laid. I have often, when a boy, cut the fern-root, and have as often succeeded in convincing myself that I saw the initials I.C. clearly defined in its veins and shadings. The impression of a fern on the shoulder of the ass, is a fact equally accredited. It had high honour in the olden day. Its root still bears the marks thereof, indeed, But those our learnÃ¨d clerks alone can read. When the Redeemer deigned to visit earth, And, though divine, to be of mortal birth, Lowly and meek of heart, on foot he trod; In all his blameless life, but once he rode. And then no stately chariot marked his pride, No pompous steed that Monarch might bestride; The Assâthe all-despisedâreceived for load, That day, the Form of the Incarnate God! And Heâthe kind, the tender-bosomed Oneâ Heâwho inflicted pain or ill on noneâ Heâwhile the vast, adoring multitude His peaceful way with peaceful palms bestrewedâ Rode humbly thus, and carried in his hand A simple mountain fern, instead of wand! The shoulders of the creature, some discern, Still bear the figure of the honoured fern, As if He claimed, by that transmitted grace, Our care and kindness for the patient race. Alas the while! like many more of His, That gentle claim by man neglected is!â VI. Thus ran the Maiden onâdescribing still Each object seen, or met with, on the hill, And ever intermingling fancy meet, Or legend, like her nature, simply sweet. âBertha!â I cried, âthou art a kindly elf, And framest all thy legends like thyself! I would repay thee; for I too full well The native legends of my land could tell. But most of them are of a nature sternâ Unlike thy story of the mountain fern. In sooth, the meek god whom thy tale describes, Would little suit our roving Northern tribes! Almighty Woden, Odin, or Woden, was the chief god of the Scandinavians. His Palace was Valhalla, where he rewarded all such as died sword in hand. The rewards are described in the text. âThere remain to this day,â says Mallet, âsome traces of the worship paid to Woden in the name given by almost all the people of the north to the fourth day of the week, which was formerly consecrated to him. It is called by a name which signifies Woden's day.â To which I add that the Northumbrian peasantry of the present time, probably pronounce the name of the day in prceisely the same manner as did their ancestors in the times of paganism. The call it Wadnesdayâsounding the a in the first syllable as in father. when on earth alive, In glorious battle ever loved to strive; And still, high-seated in Valhalla, saves The richest draught for him who nobly braves Death on the field of heroes, and who goes Most deeply crimsoned with the blood of foes! He, when the iron ranks of war we pierce, Breathes into every breast his spirit fierce, Tillâfilled with his divine, inspiring breathâ We mock at suffering, we exult in death, And, proudly passing from the field of fame, Join the Immortal whence our valour came, And, ever in the god's own presence there, By turns the battle and the banquet share! Butâthere no longer ranked with mortal menâ Our daily battles will be pastime then; Then will our nightly banquets have a zest No earthly banquets ever yet possessed; For we shall quaff from out Valhalla's horn Mead-draughts immortalâpure as dews of morn! Such glorious god, such future life, be mine!â Yet, lovely Bertha, I would hear of thine.â VII. âAlas,â said Bertha, âvery ill would be The spell of God set forth, if done by me. Dr. Adam Clark derives the word gospel from two Saxon words, God and spellâi.e. God's spell, or charm. For spell indeed it is, a potent charm All-ghastly Death of terror to disarm, And change the Spectre to a Seraph bright That opes to us the gates of Heaven and Light! Yet it is simple too; and since you ask, To try to tell it will be pleasing task. âBut first, no god of wood or stone have we, No Idol own, no local Deity. He whom we worship, fills unbounded space; He fixed the stedfast Cheviots in their place; Streams, small or great, took currents from his hand; The winding Beaumont flowed at his command. He made the Sun. Yon azure Sky above Is the blue curtain woven by his loveâ Spread o'er the world by day, and, in the night, Besprinkled with his thousand stars of light. He formed the Moon; and, what may seem to thee A greater proof of power, he formed the Seaâ Which, though 'tis able to engulph in brine Ten thousand fleets as numerous as thine, Fills not the hollow of the Mighty Hand That fixed its boundaries, and curved its strand!â VIII. Then did she tell how Man he madeâin mind Fair as the universe for him designed; And how man turned aside, and, in brief time, Fell from his state of purity to crime; How bloodâhow kindred bloodâfor vengeance cried, And how with blood the very earth was dyed; Till God grew weary of a stubborn race That lived to grieve his soul, and scorn his grace. How then the world he drowned, but saved a few By whom was peopled all the earth anew; And how the second race, still self-accursed, Were soon as wicked as had been the first. Again did kindred blood for vengeance cry,â But there was Mercy this time in the sky! âThe Son of God,â she said, âhis only Son, His Son Beloved, and with the Father One, Came down into the guilty world, was born Of Womanâ(still on every Christmas morn We celebrate that birth; you Danish men Call the same season Yule, and revel then, Profaning the good time)âTo men he showed The way of life, the certain path to God. The men he would have taught and saved, ingrate, Returned him boundless scorn and bitter hate; His pure and priceless gold accounted dross, And seized and nailed him to the felon's Cross! âEclipse and earthquake, in his dying hour, Marked the sad triumph of the Evil Power: The sickening Sun beheld the tragic spot, Beheld and trembledâmadmen trembled not! IX. âThe Tomb received the Saviour's relics cold, The Tomb received themâbut it could not hold! On the third morn, before the day-light broke, Self-animated, as from sleep, he woke! Self-raised, he rose! He rose, as all the wise Who place in him their trust, shall one day rise! âTwo women who, before his death, had hung Oft on the music of his heavenly tongue, Sought, while it yet was dark, the Sacred Tomb, Laden with spices rich, and sweet perfume, His body to annoint. They came, they sawâ Not the dear corpse they sought, but, filled with awe, Beheld, instead, two angels, by the light Of their own raiment, which was flowing white And glisteringâflowing over form and limbâ To which the whiteness of yon snow is dim! âWherefore seek ye,â the shining Angels said, âThe Living here where only dwell the Dead? Lo, He is risen!ââIn fear the women turned, Trembling, away; when He whose death they mourned, Stood, as in life, before them! living, stood, Himself, a breathing form of flesh and blood! âNor but to them did he in life appear; He talked with others who had loved him here; Showed them how Heaven, by virtue of his death, Was made, to man, accessible through Faith; And bade them bear the glorious tidings forth To every quarter of the peopled earth! Then in their sight, and in the sunshine broad, Rose to the clouds, and disappearedâto God! âWoe to the Prince, however wide his sway, Who hears the tidings, and then turns away! Joy to the Peasant, howsoe'er despised, Who hears with faith, and is with faith baptised! Such peasant, dying, to a state shall mount, Where thrones and sceptres are of no account!â X. With wonder, Harold, doubtless, thou hast heard Poor Bertha's story almost word for word, When she has long been turned to dustâas I, Who now repeat it, very soon shall lie! But the relation was so new to me, So simply told, and yet so feelingly, Thatâmore than I to Bertha then confessed, Or even cared to thinkâit touched my breast. Hence every word, with every shade of tone The Maiden gave itâas we walked alone On that green mountain-sideâis in my ear, Distinct as on the day I stood to hear! âNot very wrong,â I said, âthe creed can be, Sweet Bertha! since it is believed by thee; And should it e'er be mine, the praise or blame (But be it praise!) shall rest upon thy name; And, trust me, I will come for baptism then, To the pure waters of thy favourite Glen!â I said it half in jest, and yet, 'tis odd, Those very waters saw me given to God. XI. More might my tongue have said, but that I saw A moving Form betwixt us and the haugh, Haugh. This word is hardly English; but it ought to be so, since its use by Scott and Burns. It means level ground bordering on a river. Now brightly vanishing by bush or tree, Then shaming sunshine on the open lea! âBertha!â I cried, âdo Angels still descend From Heaven to Earth, to bless us and befriend? If so, there hither cometh, as I live, The very Angel of thy narrative!â âO hush!â said Bertha gravely. âSuch bold strain In mouth of Christian were esteemed profane. It is no Angel, but a Woman good, That now hath issued from the oaken wood. The gentle Lady of thy heart is near, And simple Bertha claims no more thine ear!â At the same time the Maiden sighed and smiled, Then added: âIn a place so lone and wild, She seldom leaves the Tower without a guard,â And lo! I see them riding hitherward. O'er yonder copse are flashing helm and plume, And prancing steeds are bursting through the broom!â The latter words on me were all but lostâ A nearer, fairer sight my eyes engrossed! XII. The moment often dreamed of when alone, And often prayed for, was at length my own! The Vision of my wildest dream stood there, There stood th' Inspirer of my warmest prayer! And Iâwho had, in hours of silent thought, Befitting term and phrase not vainly sought, To meet th' expected timeâhad trained my heart, When it should come, to play no timid partâ And who had ever, in the front and van Of conflict, borne me as becomes a manâ Now found my spirits, erst so high and proud, In presence of that Lady changed and cowed! XIII. 'Tis vain, my son! I cannot half express The charm of her Imperial loveliness! She had the look, the manner, and the mien, The step and stature of a Virgin Queen! She hardly seemed to walk, but rather glideâ 'Twas the swan's motion on a gentle tide! The summer wind was playing with her hairâ I've heard them say, my son, that thine is fair. I doubt if on another human head Tresses so beautiful were ever shed! Did craftsman skilled the precious secret hold To work with sunbeams, as he works with gold, He might, perchance, collect, arrange, and twine A gossamer-wreath that so would curl and shine! Thus too, her perfect form, her faultless face, A sculptor might have well essayed to trace; But then he could not have informed the whole, And lighted up the countenance with Soul! With Soul, that gave to lip, to cheek, to eye, Each its expression, rich, or soft, or high, To every glance and every movement grace, To all a powerâwhich is denied a place In the mere living piece of soulless earth, Whatever be its mould, its rank, its birth! XIV. I see her, Harold, on that mountain-side, In all her virgin beauty's bloom and pride! I see her, Harold, in the dearer light Of many an after year, whenâscarce less bright, But somewhat softened, mellowed by the lapse Of time, and touched by passing grief, perhapsâ She shone in hours of sadness and of gloom, Like Bertha's Angel in the Sacred Tomb! Speaking to me of life, of hope, of cheer, Of blissful worlds that never saw a tear! Worlds! into whichâif true the Christian creed, And if not true, 'twere very sad indeedâ She long hath passed! Her high and queenly brow Is crowned with fairer, brighter tresses now; And, hardly less than Seraph even here, She is a Seraphâin a happier sphere! XV. She came. Her first look almost set at rest The wild wave of commotion in my breast; Her first wordâfrank, and destitute of artâ Completely reassured my settling heart. She named the peril I for her had braved; She thanked me for the life my arm had saved; And, lightly passing all I owed to her, Entitled me her kind Deliverer. She marked the deadly pallor of my cheek; She noticed that I still seemed faint and weak; And said she dreaded I should brook but ill A lengthened journey over holt and hill. For of such lengthened journey, she averred, She had, alas! that very morning heard, And the first chance, in gratitude, had sought, To give me warning of the tidings brought. XVI. My countrymen, she said, with torch and brand, Had ravaged all along the eastern strand; Had first laid waste the peaceful banks of Tyne, Then made the billows of the Humber shine With midnight fires. Thence marching, they had since O'ercome, in arms, the bravest Saxon prince; And now advanced their high and daring claims To hold e'en London, and its sea-wayâThames, Where now their fleet was moored. Her kinsman Chief, She added, zealous for the land's relief, Esteemed my presence with the royal host, As what would serve the patriot cause the most; And had himself arrived, that morn, to bring His valued Prisoner to the Saxon king. XVII. Conflicting thoughts the Lady's news inspiredâ My friends' bold raid my mounting spirit fired; I heard the tale of battle far remote, As if I listened to the trumpet-note; My hand, instinctively, essayed to clasp The trusty steelâwhich was not near my grasp; And with that bitter consciousness recurred The truth, as bitter, of the Lady's word,â That I was in captivity, afar, And scarcely fitâif near and freeâfor war! Until th' announcement made to me that morn, My fetters had been light, and lightly worn; Now, for the first time, painfully I felt Close round my every limb their iron belt, Thenceforth to gall me, and to gall the more, That my brief, brilliant dream of love was o'er! For final seemed the mandate I had heard; And thence my lover's fears at once inferred, That pass but some few minutesâfew and fleetâ We who had scarcely met, no more should meet! From the sharp spur and torture of that thought, A desperate energy my spirit caught, Which made me overlook, it may be, slight The wily arts employed by lover light, A gentle Maiden's gentle ear to please; But served my purpose, haply, more than these. For genuine Passion breaks obstruction through, And winsâwhere Prudence is afraid to woo! XVIII. Half kneeling on the sward, with upturned look, Her fair handânot withheldâin mine I took; She, slightly bending forward, seemed to hear The words I spoke, with no reluctant ear. âLady! a chilling frost thy tidings bring, That falls, and withers all my bosom's spring! I gaze on thee; but the sad time comes fast, Nay, it comes now, when I may gaze my last! Then O! forgive me, if I now reveal The hope I cherished, and the pang I feel! I love thee, Lady! deeply, madly love!â And knew I any word that word above, In deep or wild significance, its use Would, in my passion, find a fit excuse! I love!âAnd hear meâI am of a line That boasts a rank, it may be, high as thine; And though to-day a Captive, I may be, By battle or by ransom, soon as free. O sayâwere ever that my fortune's chanceâ Might I not hope to meet thy favouring glance? If too abrupt my earnest question fall, Blame the ill-sorted timeânot meâfor all! Blame time, or me! but, Fairest, bid me hope, And I with more than fate will boldly copeâ With more than fate wage battle haught and high, And for thee live, or moreâwill for thee die!â XIX. Deep, undissembled anguish thrilled my breast; Close to my burning lips her hand I pressed; Nor to withdraw it thence essayed sheânor Appeared a frown upon her brow therefor. A high and quick suffusion, rosy red, O'er her fine countenance just came and fledâ Such passing tinge the mountain snow hath worn, When clouds of crimson have been rife at morn! âBrave Dane, I will not,â she replied, âaffect To feel displeasure, where I feel respect. It is to thee I owe, that I have now. The power at once to feel it, and avow; And this is not a time, nor likes my heart, To meet thy honest truth with needless art. In turn forgive me, then, if to thy suit My ear is closed, and if my tongue is mute! Though not indeed a prisoner like thee, I am, in sober sooth, as little free. My noble kinsman holds within his power Disposal of my person and my dower. I can but wed me as that kinsman wills, Who thus my dying sire's bequest fulfils; And rest assured, that with a Heathen Dane To match his Ward, by him were deemed profane. Hope then no more!âAnd yet, if thy fair aim, Instead of worthless love, were worthy fame, For thee there yet remains a noble part, And one befitting well thy generous heart!â XX. âO name it not!â I cried. âDeprived of thee, Lady, no further part remains for me. âI err. One part there is! Unbind my chain; Give me my free blade in my hand again; Before me set thy friends in war-array; And I, as man hath never slain, will slayâ Despair inspiring me to shed a flood Of gore, and revel in thy kindred's blood! O no, no, no! The wretch I could not be, To slaughter men who must be dear to thee! My love, I feel, unmans me. I have done With all that warriors prize beneath the sunâ War and its fame, the light of woman's eye! Nerveless and hopeless, I have but to die.â âDie! thou shalt live!â she said, âand give me yet To owe a deeper and a dearer debt! My life is little; but, Sir Dane, to save A nation's life, were worthy of the brave! Hear me. My Country bleeds at every pore; The deadly strife, alas! seems all but o'er; Our ancient glories vanished, woe and shame Are all that wait the Saxon power and name! Gorged with our people is thy Raven Blackâ It rests with thee, perhaps, to turn him back; It rests with thee to bid these inroads cease, And leave our suffering Land its wonted peace, Do this, and win thee honours, pure and proud!â But wherefore cometh on thy brow a cloud?â XXI. She was aright. My Danish spirit burned; The part assigned, indignantly it spurned; No longer there a kneeling suitor, I Stood up, erect, and firmly made reply: âNo, Lady not for thee! not for thy love! Though valued all earth's wealth and fame aboveâ Though all earth's wealth and fame, against it, weigh As less than nothingâwould I see the day, When treacherous word or deed of mine turned back To his own fields my glorious Raven Black! Strong let him soar, and high, till he survey The Saxon Island as his own wide prey! Strong let him soar, and high! or, feeble, sink!â But let no one who fears or loves me, think That I the base, degenerate wretch can prove Who gives his Country for his selfish Love!â Some admiration, and no small amaze, I saw, were blended in the Lady's gaze, As thus I spoke. âBrave Dane!â at last she cried, âCouldst thou imagine that my words implied Dishonour? Mine! who idolise the fame That gilds the patriotic warrior's name, Nor lightly thine! I should most deeply grieveâ But here comes One who soon will undeceive Thy mind on this.â I turned me round to seeâ A troop of armÃ¨d horsemen scoured the lea; Up to our hill-side stance, like light, they flew, Wheeled, and a living circle round us drew! XXII. The young and graceful Leader of the troop Reined up his steed beside our little group,â To Bertha cast familiar smile, to me A word or two of studied courtesy, But to his lovely Ward such phrase sincere As gentle brothers use to sister dear. And, certes, Harold, as I gazed on both, I could, it seemed to me, have ventured oath, That nearer kindredship the parties claimed, Than either Bertha or herself had named. 'Twas singular to see their aspects strike, At the same time, so different and so like! To see the lines of beauty in her face, Become, produced in his, heroic grace; And that sweet dignity of look and mien, Which might, in her, have graced a youthful Queen, Roughen in him, until it took the air Of martial Leader, prompt to do and dare! Moved by the semblance, though a haughty Dane, I almost longed to join the Chieftain's train, Take, at his side, a brother-warrior's place, And link my future with his name and race. Such inconsistency can Love awake! My heart was with him for the loved One's sake. XXIII. A moment's space some talk, apart, they hadâ His look was earnest, and his tone was sad; While from his lovely listener's raised eye-lid The frequent tear-drop gathered, gleamed, and slid. Meantime, two armed attendants came with speed, One brought my arms, one led a saddled steed, When I, by them accoutered soon, and horsed, Sat ready for the ride by fate enforced. Half round I turned me, as I sat on selle, That I might sayâat least might waveâfarewell; But she my glances sought, had disappeared! And I, who now some treachery vaguely feared, Was falling fast into a sullen moodâ When lo! poor Bertha at my stirrup stood. It seemed as if my very soul she read, For, speaking in the Danish tongue, she said: âDroop not, nor dread! There is no need. Of those Who lead thee forth, not all, be sure, are foes. There ride to-day, along with them and thee, Some who would perish, but to set thee free, Were freedom wished. To this one sign attendâ The man who speaks thy language is a friend. Farewellâfarewell! and O! through life and death, Thy guide and guard be He of Nazareth!â E'en while she spoke, the line of march was made, And swiftly forward moved the cavalcade. CANTO IV. I. The breeze of that sweet Morn, which freshly fanned The verdant bosom of the sun-bright land, And blew away each lingering vapour-wreath, From lowland valley and from upland heath, Bade, with like power, the gloomy thoughts depart That had been darkly gathering round my heart! My spirit, wakened by the gradual change From landscape known, to landscape new and strange, And ever varyingâregained at length Its native buoyancy, its native strength, And rose, as it had ever done, to note Each charm of scene, adjacent or remote. I marked the rude huts of the labouring poor, That stood by sheltering crag, or fenceless moor: And scarce less rude, but stronger, massier far, The castles of the Chiefs who led in war. But far apart those castles were, and few, And seldom came those lowly huts in view. While all the land between, lay waste and wild, Whereâsave lone Natureânothing ever smiled! II The savage wild-boar roused him from his lair; Leaped from her grassy form the timid hare; The deer just gazed and fled; the tawny fox Showed his long brush, and vanished 'mid the rocks; The bolder bison The Wild Cattle still found in the parks of Chillingham and Gisburn, are probably the only remains of the true and genuine breed of that species of cattle, and answer, says Mackenzie in his History of Northumberland, in every particular, the description given by Boethius of these animals. led his wild herd's van, And, loudly bellowing, glared on horse and man, While, mustering close behind him, every brute Seemed bent our right of passage to dispute. These passedâbefore us, as we onward rode, Wild birds their various forms and plumage showed. The long-winged heron left the lonely spring; The raven soared away on sooty wing; Providing for its young and clamorous brood, The rook was busy in the ancient wood; The curlew sent his whistle, wild and loud, Down from a clear blue sky without a cloud; And far above them all, in broad sun-light, The royal eagle sped his arrowy flight. III. Whether intending thereby to confer A mark of honour on his prisoner, Or for my safer keepingâat his side The Leader had arranged that I should ride. We rode along in silence, till he saw The sullen shadow from my brow withdraw, When, taking of my altered humour heed, Heâas on rising ground we slackened speedâ Accosted me with courteous air and bland, And, smiling, asked me how I liked the land? I answered him that, Captive as I was, For liking, I, in sooth, had little cause; But for the land, three words might give its stateâ 'Twas beautifulâ'twas wildâ'twas desolate. IV. âIt is so,â he replied; âand I, Sir Dane, Should like to see it made the fair domain Of Man, and not of wild-beast. It is well In Nature's charge to leave the rugged fellâ To let her cherish there, e'en as she will, The heath, the gorse, the fern, and bramble still; But pity 'tis, that ample vales like these, Which skilful culture could transform with ease To fertile fields, to meads, and pastures green, Should lie, as now, a bleak and barren scene. 'Tis pity too, to see each streamlet hereâ As liquid crystal brillant, pure, and clearâ Winding its way through marsh, and bog, and fen, Or wildly dashing down a savage glen. How very different, were yon thorny brow The fair seat of some peaceful Chieftain now, Who with a firm, but still a friendly hand, Might rule the happy tenants of his land. How different too, if on this lovely spot Rose the poor peasant's neat and sheltered cotâ Himself employed in cheerful toil, his wife At home preparing all that sweetens life, And his hale offspring, on the daisied lea, Engaged in gambols held with noisy glee! Would that such peasant everywhere I saw, Protected by his country's equal law, Rejoicing in his King's paternal care, And faringâas a poor man ought to fare! But I, Sir Dane, in talking thus, must seem To thee, indulging in a waking dream.â V. 'Twas new indeed, I owned, to hear the fare Of poor men counted worth a great man's care, E'en in a passing word. The hard, the rough, Dull boor might be of consequence enough, In work a requisite, a want in war, In all beside, beneath attention farâ I checked me, Harold; for, this strain to hear, The Chieftain's look turned grave, if not severe. âStranger,â he said, âI mourn, but marvel not, To hear you lightly hold the rustic's lot. A feeling that, which oftentimes finds way With the unthinking heirs of earthly sway. But I, Sir Dane, have lived among the poor, Have been the inmate of the rudest boor, Have shared his frugal meal, his temperate bowl, Have watched the workings of his inmost soul,â And thence have learned to comprehend his state, And all his worth aright to estimate. Take this for truth: The difference that may lie Betwixt the humble classes and the high, It is not Fortune, it is Nature, that has made the essential differences between Men; and whatever appellation a small number of persons who speak without sufficient reflection, may affix to the general body of their fellow-creatures, the whole difference between the Statesman, and many a Man from among what they call the dregs of the people, often lies in the rough outside of the latter.âDe Lolme on the Constitution of England. Consists far more in manner, and in art, Than it doth in the Head, or in the Heart. The peasant, happy in his station low, Knows all that it concerns himself to know; Has loyalty; has faith at least sincere; Has dauntless heart, and conscience O how clear! The sense of kindness in his breast is strong; Strong is his love of right, his hate of wrong; And, maugre all the hardships of his fate, He bears a heart-felt reverence for the great; Though, if a true confession must be made, His heart-felt reverence oft is ill repaid! I hold, the Monarch, whoâamid his zeal And well-planned efforts for the public wealâ O'erlooks his welfare, in that act alone Shuns more than half the duties of his throne! O! when thou shalt regain thy high command, Look ever to the lowly of thy land; For knowâwhate'er the thoughtless proud may sayâ They form its very strength, its very stay!â VI. âThou canst not mean an insult; but to me Thy words, at this time, sound like mockery. For how,â I said, âregain my lost command? My freedomânay, my lifeâis in thy hand. I wot not whither now with thee I wend; Nor if, when it is reached, this journey's end Shall hasten, or retard, my destined doomâ Unbar a prison, or unclose a tomb!â âThen, generous Dane,â he cried, âmost glad am I To bid suspicion and foreboding fly. This journey leads thee to a Monarch, whoâ E'en in a foeâto valour gives its due. King Alfred hath been told of thy brave feat At Lindisfarne, and deems it just and meet Such recompense for that brave feat to make, As he can give thee, and as thou mayst take. Look round. What think'st thou of This Land for meed? This landâthe wholeâfrom Humber to the Tweed? You smile, Sir Dane. Not less the scheme is fixed! Allâvale and mountainâthose fair streams betwixt, The King makes over to thy Chief and thee, To hold of him in equal sovereignty.â âBy mighty Thor!â I cried, âa princely gift! But tell me, if thou canst, the Donor's drift. No monarch wise will his dominions part, Without some motive prompting at the heart; And gift less splendid would by far exceed The value of a mere instinctive deed. Unfold that motive, or at least unfold The terms on which a Kingdom we may hold.â VII. âBrave Dane, when I shall thee in presence bring, There mayst thou learn the secret of the King,â The Leader answered. âI can but surmiseâ But deem the motive pure, the purpose wise. The Monarch wishes peace, and, for its sake, Would friends of foes, and of invaders, make; Would place you, as an iron barrier, then, Between him and your other countrymen; Or join your martial people to his own, As brothers banded round a common throne; And, linked at once in polity and faith, Defy the world in arms to do it scathe. Such would appear the King's design, and he Commits its conduct and success to thee. For this he purposes that thou shalt wendâ Not as his Captive, but his trusted Friendâ To Guthrum's camp. The King, I hear, would spurn A pledge, if offered it, for thy return, Beyond thy own free wordâin which his trust Is steadfast as, I doubt it not, 'tis just.â VIII. âKing Alfred honours me,â âI said, âand I Will not the royal confidence belie. But that my mission can, or will, succeed; That Guthrum will adopt your Christian creed; Will to your King required allegiance give; Or stoop beneath your Saxon laws to liveâ (For that your sense I apprehend to be Of the two terms of âfaithâ and âpolityâ) Is what I little hope,âand hope still less, When, as I hear, unchecked and high success Attends his arms. The Victor's towering soul Accepts no part. It claims and grasps the whole.â âThen he may find,â the Leader sternly cried, âSharp lesson taught to his o'erweening pride! A stubborn soul the English Saxon hath, Not very soon, or lightly, roused to wrath; But, once enkindled, your proud Chief may know, It burnsâtill it consumes himself, or foe! Believe me, were our youthful King to meet, E'en in a hundred fields to come, defeat,â There still would gather round him, near and far, Fresh force to feed the patriotic war. For never upon England's soil, Sir Dane, Shall foreign foot in quietude remain!â Except it be by such agreement fair, As thou art destined by the King to bear.â IX. The long ascent, by this time, was passed o'er, And level stretched, for miles, the land before. Again, at signal given, to wonted speed Each bending horseman spurred his willing steed. We crossed the Coquet's blue and winding stream; Next hour we saw the wooded Wansbeck gleam; To miles of moor day lent its failing shine, But ceased to light us ere we reached the Tyne, Whose surface broad, as liquid silver bright, Was softly rippling in the Moon's calm light. The passage of the river soon made good, We halted there beside a black pine-wood; Turned loose our weary steeds to graze at will; Sat down upon the margin of a rill, To moisten thence our welcome crust of bread; Then pulled the mountain heather for our bed. Andâlaid a glorious Summer Moon beneathâ Tell me what couch can vie with couch of heath? His cloak his covering, and the wide blue sky, With all its stars, his stately canopy, Each hardy warrior proudly lay, and well!â One only, waked and walked as sentinel. X. Sunk on his couch of hearther, soft and deep, The gallant Chief was not the last to sleep; I, stretched beside him, wakeful vigil kept, And would notâeven if I couldâhave slept. The offer fair of country and of sway, Made in the Saxon Monarch's name that day, Had, while it banished all my doubts and fears, Revived my hopes. Yearsâlong and brilliant yearsâ My fancy drew, of pomp, and power, and pride; Nor failed with that loved One to grace my side, Without whose presence, pomp, and pride, and power, Were but the showy nothings of an hour! âAs thus I mused, and wore the night away, A lovely night that seemed a softer day, A gentle touch my shoulder lightly stirredâ I looked; a face I saw, a voice I heard; The faceâa man'sâwas closely o'er me hung, The voice addressed me in my native tongue. Strong was its whisper in my ear: âAttend! The man who speaks thy language is a friend.â âThe very words of Bertha these!â âMost true, And therefore can they bode but well to you. Wouldst thou escape? Tell meâbut under breath. The Chieftain lightly sleeps, and it were death To meâfound thus.â âEscape!â I quickly said, âAy! gold to him who lends successful aid! The wretch deserves a life-long slave to be, Who will not, when he has the chance, be free! But how? I see no means; and, Stranger, harkâ Thou find'st in me no mate for villain dark! Hardly to win my freedom, would I shred A single hair from off his manly head!â He grasped my hand. âBelieve me, not to gain His wished-for freedom even to a Dane, Would Eric hurt him! Rest theeâthou art free! The timeâthe placeâthe meansâentrust to me.â He softly left my side, and on the ground, As sentinel, resumed his moonlight round. XI. Unlooked-for freedom placed within my view, Gave to my stream of thought a current new. My long-lost friends to mingle with again; Once more my Guthrum to my breast to strain; And by some feat in future battle shown, For past inaction something to atone; Would, of themselves, have powerful motives proved To prompt me to escape. But others moved. I saw a great advantage to be gained To me, by libertyâif now obtained. Admitting that in perfect faith was made The royal offer through the Chief conveyed, I doubted not, if free my course to trace, I could with more effect and better grace, Impress its prompt acceptance on my friend, Than if as Captive I were forced to wend. While with the Saxon King, no longer bound, I then should treat on high and equal ground, And thus obtain for Guthrum terms, perchance, Fairer than he could win by sword and lance. Or granting aught the hope of concord mar, And that th' event, at last, be left to war, My arm, my counsel, not to say my skill, Would, in the strait supposed, be useful still; And I might conquer, not fair lands alone, But a fair Brideâto grace my future throne! Spite of such inward visions, sleep at last My heavy eyes began to overcast; Which yet closed most unwillingly, and oft Again would open on the moonlight soft, And snowy garments see, and shapes divine, Blend with the flashings of the streamy Tyne! XII. The eastern beam, o'er vales of moorland borne, Shed beauty on our march, resumed at morn. We passed the valley of the Wear at noon; And couched, by Swale, again beneath the moon. The third day fair was setting, calm and sheen, When neared we Craven's pastoral mountains green; The beautiful and romantic district of Craven, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, deserves a poet and a poem to itself. Whernside, mentioned in the next page, is the highest of its mountains; and the dale of the Wharf one of the wildest and most beautiful of its glens. The latter is overlooked, on the south, by Kilnsey Cragâdescribed in âThe Outlaw.â And gloom fell on us, as we slowly went Down mighty Whernside's long and steep descent. But 'twas a gloom that suddenly gave way To the mild, soft, and unobtrusive ray, Which now began, along the quiet dell, To gleam on rocky peak and pinnacle! XIII. Behind the eastern mountain, huge and dim, The Moon just showed to us her rising rim; By slow degrees the misty barrier cleared, At length a circle, full and broad, she reared, And, still ascending, upward calmly rolled An orb yet beamlessâas of dusky gold! A moment more, and from her azure way In ether, smiled she with unclouded ray, Far down into the depth of that long dell Whichâoverlooked by mountain and by fellâ Is watered by the Wharf, whose murmuring flow Was audibleânot visibleâbelow; For all along the winding dell, that night, A waveless lake of summer mist lay white In the calm moonshineâlay at rest, unstirred, Save when a sudden gust of windâscarce heard To sigh from Arncliffe's wild and neighbouring glenâ Heaved its light-opening folds aside, and then The rapid Wharf, in momentary shine, Led on his waters in a silver line! XIV. High o'er the mist, in moonlight calm and clear, Like some tall rock that juts on inland mere, Hung Kilnsey Crag. The white and vapoury wreath Half veiled the little hamlet placed beneath. 'Twas here I recognised a horseman fleet Emerging from the mist our line to meet, As Ericâwhom my eye had tried in vain All day, to find amid the warrior train, But who, it seems, had ta'en of us the start. The Leader hailed him, and they spoke apart. Then, turning quickly to the right, we rode On ground, where horse's hoof had seldom trod! Up wild and pathless mountain-sides we climbed; Down rugged steeps our cautious pace we timed; Now over quaking moss we lightly sped; Dismounting now, our weary steeds we led. And thus we reached a copious mountain brook, Which purely gushed from what appeared a nook Formed by two meeting hillsâa sheltered place, Affording pasturage and ample space; But whichâapproachedâthrew wide its rocky jaws, And by its gloomy grandeur made us pause! Half cave, half chasm, it yawned!âAbsorbed, I saw; And gazed in wonder, not unmixed with awe. XV. Like the extensive area of some Tower Which giants might have made their place of power, But whence the hand of Rage, or Ruin, all Had torn away of each interior wall, And yet had spared the outward barriers still, High, massive, rude, and indestructibleâ Opening on my astonished glance, at first, The rugged glooms of savage Gordale burst! This place, the description of which I have feebly attempted, both in this poem and in âThe Outlawâ is, says Dr. Whitaker, âa solid mass of limestone, cleft asunder by some great convulsion of nature, and opening its âponderous and marble jawsâ on the right and left. The sensation of horror on approaching it, is increased by the projection of either side from its base, so that the two connivent rocks, though considerably distant at the bottom, admit only a narrow line of day-light from above. At the very entrance you turn a little to the right, and are struck by a yawning mouth in the face of the opposite crag, whence the torrent, pent up beyond, suddenly forced a passage within the memory of man, which, at every swell, continues to spout out one of the boldest and most beautiful cataracts that can be conceivedâ âI am well aware,â he adds, âhow imperfect the foregoing account will be thought by every one who has formed his ideas on the spot. It must, however, be remembered that the pencil, as well as the pen, has hitherto failed in representing this astonishing scene.ââHistory of Craven. In front, and on the right, abruptly sprung The living rock, and, slanting forward, hungâ Extending from its deep and caverned base A darksome shadow over half the spaceâ Till, far above our heads, it almost closed With the gigantic rocks that stood opposed; Leaving small space, through which the eye might view The sky of night's bestarred and tender blue! Beneath, the level floor was all bestrown With numerous fragments, which the cliffs had thrown, As slow decay, or lightning's sudden dint, Through years disjoined them from the parent-flint. With some alarm I gazed upon the proof Of possible peril from the peaks aloof, And looking round me to descry a place Of greater safety gained the gloomy base, Of that far-slanting rock, whereâfeeling free From aught, except an Earthquake's jeopardyâ I stood and saw, with marvel ever new, A scene yet wilderâstrangerâgiven to view! XVI. Right, left, in front, still toweredâall rudely piledâ The rocks in masses, rugged, high, and wild, Formless, or cast in every varied form The mountain crag receives from time and storm! And where they towered most rugged, wild, and high, An orifice I saw, that showed the sky, And pouredâas if from out the sky itself!â A mighty torrent down the rocky shelf, Which, being dashed from ledge to ledge, at last Became the quiet brook we just had passed. Descending 'mid the cavern's gloomy night, The broad and broken fall of waters white Resembled most a gush of moonshine clear, Streamed through a thickly-clouded atmosphereâ The single intimation which is given That there is then a lovely Moon in heaven! XVII. Bound by the wild power of the scene, amazed While Chief and follower stood, like me, and gazed, I felt a sudden touch, and, turning round, My self-announced Deliverer I found. âIt is the timeâit is the place,â he said, âFollow!â and quickly gliding forth, he fled. I followedâfollowed unobservedâthe man; Nor needest thou enquire if fast I ran! Lingers the hare, with yelling hounds in view? Loiters the hart, when his swift foes pursue? 'Tis but for life that these exert their pace, And more than life depended on my race! Led by the motions of my faithful guide, My course was all along the streamlet's side, Until into a gentle pool it fell, Just at the entrance of a sylvan dell. Here rose a little knoll, whose grassy base The mountain hazel-shrub was seen to grace; And hnman eye that had not practised been, Could, certes, there but hazel-shrub have seen; But my friend, stooping, quickly tore aside The tangled boughs, and showed an opening wideâ The entrance of an unsuspected Cave, This cave, sufficiently described in the next Canto, and in âThe Outlaw,â may be found by the curious a few hundred yards from Gordale. Which now to us its welcome refuge gave! The lately-parted boughs of hazel green, Uniting fast, renewed their leafy screen. Hard was the couch; but, being safe and free, That couch of mountain stone was soft to me. The baffled troop, without, might search the rocksâ The dogs might bayâwhen snugly earthed the fox! CANTO V. I Reflected light, as if from water cast, On the Cave's vault of stone was quivering fast, And the fresh fall and flow of water near Was murmuring and dashing in mine ear, When I from sleep awoke, and looking through The screen of hazel, I beheld a view Of sylvan sweetness. Morning's glorious beam Was on the pool, and on the falling stream, And, as the whitely-dashing spray it kissed, Made shifting rainbows of the rising mist! Each tree hung out its branches all unstirred In the calm air; each branch sustained a bird, That sat and sung; each green leaf in its curl Held drops of dewâeach drop a trembling pearl! Tree, water, crag, in sunshine and in shade, With the blue sky o'er all, a picture made, Which, in the faithful glass of Memory set, Is gay and green, is fresh and sparkling yet! II. Brief gaze I took; then turned to rouse my guide, Who still lay fixed in slumber at my side. A man he was, whose scanty locks of gray Showed he had passed of life the middle day; But whose black, piercing eye, and active frame Advancing years had little 'vailed to tame. I told him day appeared already high, And asked him if it now was time to fly? âNot yet,â the old man answered. âWhile we stay, Here we are safe; for, soothly I may say, No mortal man, except with Satan's aid, Can ever find the place where we are laid! I knew the cave of old, and think 'tis styled, By the few Dwellers round these mountains wild, The Cave of Gennet, who, they used to tell, A Fairy was, that loved the sylvan dell, And haunted cave and streamâtill put to flight For ever by the beams of Gospel-light. Such tales, be sure, have little weight with me; But when I learned thy wish was to be free, I then at once bethought me of the place; And hoped ifâaided by St. Mary's graceâ I could persuade the Chief, though but a day, To quit the vale, and keep the mountain way, I might contrive to lodge thee safely here, Until thy pathway of escape were clear.â III. âBut how effect it?â âEven thus: As scout, Ere dawn of yestermorn was I sent out; At night I told the Chief that then the Danes In small detachments scoured the level plains. An accidental fire, whose line of smoke Far o'er the distant landscape faintly broke, Gave timely colour to a specious tale Framed to dissuade the Leader from the vale; And here thou art in Gennet's rocky cave.â âBut this, my friend, thou didst at hazard grave?â âWhy, that is true. If taken by my lord, A hasty shrift, a tree, and hempen cord Were Eric's doom. But what may hap to me, I feel as nothingâI have rescued thee!â Moved by the old man's cunning and address, But moved yet more by his devotedness, âTell me,â I said, âWhence springs the friendly zeal Which for the safety of a man you feel, Whose visage, but three summer days agone, Thine eyes had, certes, never gazed upon.â âA man,â he said, âwho from the proverb learns âOne generous deed another justly earns,â Finds that of force sufficient to enlist His kindly effortsâwhere none else exist. But wouldst thou closer into this enquire, Thou see'st in me a Dane, and Bertha's Sire.â IV. âThen,â I exclaimed, âby all the mighty gods That crowd Valhalla's ever-bright abodes, I thank thee not! but rather, while I live, Must rue the liberty your efforts give, Since it is purchased at the too high cost Of thy poor daughter leftâay, left and lost! Liefer would I rejoin thy Chieftain's train, Liefer for life the Saxon's slave remain, Than harm befell that Maid! And thouâO thou Art that maid's sire!âI almost hate thee now!â âThat fault, if fault there be, thou mayst forgive. Bertha is safe,â he said, âand long will live, Ere the young Chieftain, wise and just, and mild, Will for the guilty Father harm the Child! O sir, the Chieftain is so good!âIn me, A man of simple, untaught mind you see; But when I have observed him near, and when I have compared him with the herd of menâ He, as I said, so good, a soul of light, At once with virtue and with wisdom bright, They uninformed and savage, dark in mind, More like to demons than to humankindâ I've almost fancied him, at such a time, A sinless native of a sinless clime For some mysterious end or purpose hurled Down thence into a base and wrong-filled world!â V. âWho is the Chief, whose praises thus you press, And whom, in truth, I value hardly less?â I asked the question, but I vainly asked. A moment's space he mused. At length, âI tasked My brain, and risked my life,â he gravely said, âIn thy escape to lend my humble aidâ Partly because I knew thou art a Dane, But more, and chiefly, that, in yonder fane, You snatched my Bertha from the flames away: For this I serve thee, but not him betray! And if you knowledge of the Chief would seek, Eric, be sure, can neither hear nor speak. Talk we on other theme. The time flies on. I judge young Hengist must be here anon.â âYoung Hengist? But it may, perhaps, offend To ask who he is,â Noâa faithful friend, Bound to thy interest by as strong a tie As warm and pure affection can supply.â âWhat meanest thou?â âMy daughter Hengist loves,â He answered. âStill, his suit she disapproves. But when of thy achieved escape from foes, And of her lover's part therein, she knowsâ He hopes to win, denied to him erewhile, His valued meed in her assenting smile. Now I will tell thee all! On Beaumont Side, While men, that morn, arrayed thee for the ride, Bertha drew him and me apart. She told To us the story of thy daring bold, In a few hurried words; her fears confessed For the dark future of thy fate; impressed On us thy rescue, as a sacred thing, Holier than duty or to Chief or King,â But hark! he comes.â Just then a rustling, made By some one bursting through the hazel shade, Announced the youthful friend of whom he spoke; And Saxon Hengist on our converse broke. VI. About thine age, my son, and quite as tall, But built more strongly, and yet light withal; Of eye quick, sparkling, keen, and glossy blue; Of cheek that bore of health the freshest hue; Of hair that over all his shoulders broad In fair and yellow clusters waved and flowed Profusely; Hengist was, in very truth, A gay, a gallant, and a graceful Youth! âDisposing on the Cavern's rugged floor Of rural food an unexpected store, Which he had purveyed, for the morn's regale, From some lone cot in lovely Malhamdale, He, while we sat at meat, to Eric old His night-adventure with blunt humour told: On missing me, th' indignant Chief, he said, Had given command that instant search be made; That he, the Youthâto each suspected spot The first to lead where I, he knew, was notâ Had managed to detachâunseen, unguessedâ The horses we had ridden, from the rest, And stable them amid the greenwood glade; That he had couched him, till the cavalcade, Diminished thus, he saw resume their march, As the first dawn-rays streaked the sky's blue arch; That he had followed, with his eye, their way; And only left them when, in brightening day, They crossed the vale of Aire, and, gleaming on, Began to vanish in the line of Colne. VII. The sense of freedom thus achieved at last, Gave double relish to my plain repast. We left the Cave, our saddled steeds bestrode, And o'er the emerald dales of Craven rode. But let me not delay my onward Tale By needless note of river or of dale. Enough to say that, hurrying o'er the ground, Impatient till the distant camp I found, We scarce took needful rest. And O! at length We came where lay in sight the Danish strength. âHere Selwood Forest stretches far and wide, And there thy Danish friends,â old Eric cried, âEntrench them in their camp at Ethandunâ See! their tents whiten in the setting sun! And see! aloft the pennons wave and shine In the fair evening!âCanst distinguish thine?â I looked, but natural emotion thrilled My inmost soul, and joy mine eyes had filled. Canvas and banner waved, and armour gleamed, But blended all, and indistinct they seemed. High o'er the rest, at length my clearing eyes Beheld the tent of noble Guthrum rise, Central and huge. Above it bravely shone My country's flag, in many a battle known, In whose white field appeared the Raven Black, That soaredâas if his prey he scorned to lack; For of such stern resolve he seemed to speak By outstretched pinion, and by open beak! Nor, though his aim was foiled the following day, Can it be said the Raven missed his prey: To win Two Kingdomsâand this feat did heâ Was not discomfiture, but victory! VIII. And certes, Harold, not of failure spoke The sounds that then from out th' Encampment broke! Sounds of carousal and of boisterous mirth, That have in young and happy hearts their birth. We reached the trench. The posted guards, amazed, On me, as on a spirit, wildly gazed; But when my well-known battle-word I cried, Their joyous recognition-shout replied. That shout to us the nearest warriors drew: They came, they saw; they saw me, and they knew; And quickly thus, conveyed from man to man, Throughout the crowded camp the tidings ranâ Exciting still, as on they passed within, A wilder tumult, and a louder din! O'er the rude planks that served them for a bridge, And o'er the inner rampart's earthen ridge, Some led our steeds to stall; my friends some bore; While others cleared the crowded way before. I, raised upon a shield, with shout and song, To Guthrum's tent was proudly borne along! IX. My Guthrum in the royal tent I found, The Chief was King only on the sea and in the battle field; for in the hour of the banquet the whole troop sat in a circle, and the horns, filled with beer, passed from hand to hand, without any distinction of first man or last.âThierry's Norman Conquest. With all his bravest warriors seated round, Passing from hand to hand th' accustomed horn, Which each in turn must drain, and none might scorn! For 'twas of ample depth, the juice to hold Whose generous beverage bolder makes the bold. O'erjoyed to see the warrior-friend restored, Whom he had long believed at Woden's board, The King, arising from his seat, made sign To change the mead for draughts of purple wine. Thereafter, hasty dais, by his command, For me ascended at his own right hand; Eric, my rescuer, and himself a Dane, For seat beside me waited not in vain; And youthful Hengist, though of Saxon race, Received with us a like distinguished place. Then rose the festal glee. Brave Guthrum called, With joyous voice, for harper and for scald; And scald and harper quickly came. But ere They string could waken, or could song prepare, Had I, aside, to noble Guthrum told 'Twas mine important message to unfold, Whichâpremature as yet for others' earâ It deeply touched his interest to hear. X. Retired apart, I told to Guthrum all That had befall'n me since the Convent's fall; Of Bertha told him, and the noble dame Whom I had chanced to rescue from the flame As well as of the lore whichâsprung from Heavenâ To my old faith a sudden shock had given. I then detailed to him, in terms less brief, My conversation with the Northern Chief; The kingly offer from his King conveyed; And my escape by Eric's friendly aid. Loud Guthrum laughed. âTis very well!â he cried; âSo, thou wouldst barter for a Saxon bride Thine ancient faith, and yet, forsooth, pretend That true and deep conviction wrought that end! Confess it! from the Lady's eye was sent By far the clearest, subtlest argument! And tell me, Aymund, were not Truth's demands Pressed somewhat by the weight of Saxon lands? Well, thou art prudent!â Here his banter stayed; And grave became his manner, as he said: XI. âAymund! I need not say, I am a man Who have no time deep mysteries to scan. I worship, like my warlike sires, therefor, The honoured names of Woden and of Thor. Superstition did not blind all the ancient Scandinavians without exception. There were among them men wise enough to discover the folly of the received opinions, and courageous enough to condemn them without reserve. In the history of Olaf Tryggvason, a warrior fears not to say publicly, that he relies more on his own strength and on his arms, than upon Thor or Odin.âMallet's Northern Antiquities. Though, to confess the truth, I hold the bark That bears me bounding o'er the ocean darkâ I hold the covering shield and trusty brand That make, and keep me, victor on the landâ I hold these sinewy arms, by which I wield Alike the helm, the falchion, and the shieldâ As my best gods! nor do I care to sue For help to Idolsâbe they old or new. And did the changeful fate of war demand That I must either quit this lovely land, Or be immersed in waterâstream or springâ And rule a portion as a Christian King,â Aymund, be sure, my choice were quickly ta'en, And all my fathers' gods would frown in vain! But, not thus placed, it is my part, believe, Conditions to impose, and not receive. No power resides in England, save in me, From rocky Cornwall to the Eastern sea, From Thames's bank to Tweed's. I rule alone. E'en valiant Alfred quits his Saxon throne, And livesâif yet the vanquished Monarch liveâ A homeless Wanderer and a Fugitive, And, doubtless, would be happy to regain From me a portion of his wrenched domain! But since his present wretched plight stands thus, Why, let the learnÃ¨d Monarch sue to us! This night we give to joyâthis night at least!â He said, and led me back to song and feast. XII. Three Minstrels swept the tuneful harp. That two Of these were scalds of Danish race, I knew; And understood from Guthrum that the third A Saxon was, who had with joy been heard By all the campâand certes, none the less That half the sense the hearers could but guess, Of each quaint legend, and each old-world lay, With which he sought to wile the time awayâ Much to the fretting of the native scald, Who eagerly arose, as soon as called, To wake the song. The foremost, Rolfe upsprung. The Sea-king's The sea-king was everywhere faithfully followed and zealously obeyed, because he was always renowned as the bravest of the brave, as one who had never slept under a smoke-dried roof, who had never emptied a cup in a chimney corner.âIbid. wild, adventurous life he sung: Song. THE SEA-KING. âHe ne'er beneath a peaceful roof Drains the full horn; but, terror-proof, Enjoys the peril that he braves, And makes his serfs the winds and waves! He bids them bear his bark along, And knows they cannot bear it wrong,â Since, waft him to what shore they may, There lies the land, and there his prey! âThe warriors, seated round, at every pause, Rung on their hollow-sounding shields applause. XIII. But louder rose the listeners' wild acclaim, When turned the song to Guthrum's noble name, And told how heâtheir sea-king bold and sternâ Had Croyland sacked, as well as Lindisfarne: All the able-bodied men of the community, to the number of thirty, departed, and having loaded a boat with the relies, sacred vases, and other valuables, took refuge in the neighbouring marshes. There remained in the choir only an abbot, a few infirm old men, two of whom were upwards of a hundred years old, and some children, whom their parents, according to the devotional custom of the period, were bring-up in the monastic habit. They continued to chant psalms at all the regular hours; when that of the mass arrived, the abbot placed himself at the altar in his sacerdotal robes. All present received the communion, and almost at the same moment the Danes entered the church. The chief who marched at their head killed with his own hand the abbot at the foot of the altar, and the soldiers seized the monks, young and old, whom terror had dispersed. ... As the prior fell dead, one of the children, ten years of age, who was greatly attached to him, fell on the body weeping, and asking to die with him. His voice and face struck one of the Danish chiefs; moved with pity, he drew the child out of the crowd, and taking off his frock, and throwing over him a Danish cassock, said, âCome with me, and quit not my side for a moment.â He thus saved him from the massacre, but no others were spared.âThe Norman Conquest. Song continued. âAssisted by his brave compeers, He sung the monks the mass of spears! The service, with the day begun, Was ended ere the morning sun; When the good brethren of the place, Charmed by his ministry and grace, Into his hand the sacred hoard, The shrine's uncounted treasures poured!â âThe warriors, seated round, at every pause, Rung on their hollow-sounding shields applause. XIV. 'Twas sung how, leading thence his victor host, Guthrum at length had reached the southern coast, And come where, under Alfred's Saxon blade, The force of England stood for fight arrayed: Song continued. âThen met the ranks, and, meeting, rose The music of encountering foesâ Music more dear to warrior's heart, Than Maiden's voice, or Minstrel's art! There left the King (that music ceased) For vultures and for wolves a feast; And there, upon that last of fields, 'Mid shouting men, and clashing shields, His chiefs around him formed a ring, And hailed their Leader England's King!â âThe warriors, seated round, at every pause, Rung on their hollow-sounding shields applause. XV. Then, with the bard's accustomed tact and skill, Who knows to change his flatteries at will, The Minstrel added: âWhile, without a peer, The valiant Guthrum ran his bright career Where, where was Aymund? He, in every field, The first to combat, and the last to yield!â He paused. The harp of Anlave loudly rung, And thus that scald his ready answer sung: Song. âI dreamed a solemn dream! The song which Anlave is here represented as singing, was suggested to me by a genuine Danish lyric, thus given by Thierry. âI dreamt a dream. Methought I was at day-break in the hall of Walhalla, preparing all things for the reception of the men killed in battles. âI awakened the heroes from their sleep; I asked them to rise, to arrange the seats and the drinking cups, as for the coming of a king. ââWhat means all this noise?â cried Braghi; âwhy are so many men in motion, and why all this ordering of seats?â ââIt is because Erik is on his way to join us,â replied Odin; âI await him with joy. Let some go forth to meet him.â ââHow is it that his coming pleases thee more than the coming of any other king?â âBecause in more battle fields has his sword been red with blood; because in more places has his ensanguined spear diffused terror.â In Woden's hall Methought I stood among his warriors all! All stood in ordered ranks, and all stood dumb, As if they waited great event to come! Th' immortal Damsels who on heroes tend, Had heaped the glittering boards from end to end With store of richest viands. On his throne The godâmajestic Wodenâsat alone. After a space, âWhat King,â aloud he cried, âExpect ye in Valhalla's mansion wide?â One answered him: âBrave Aymund comesâthe Dane.â âThen,â said the god, âye wait for him in vain. That hero still survives, and long shall be A faithful Champion of my creed and me. A hundred warriors yet, in fight, shall feel The deadly point of Aymund's conquering steel!ââ âThe warriors, seated round, at every pause, Rung on their hollow-sounding shields applause. XVI. And now, in turn, the Saxon Minstrel roseâ A man of age he seemed, a man of woes; But soon as e'er his magic harp struck he, Age turned to youth, and woe itself to glee! At least, as Guthrum whispered, such his wont; But Thought sat now upon the Old Man's frontâ Deep Thought and Sadness. Ere a note he sung, His simple harp the Minstrel softly rung, Then wakened, as a prelude, low yet strong, A something hovering between speech and song. Prelude. âIll fares it with the Saxon bard, Who loves his country now, He wears her fetter on his soul, Her shame upon his brow! Her much-loved King a fugitive, Her bravest warriors slain, While o'er the land, triumphant, soars The Raven of the Dane! Such bard, among his Country's foes, Must veil her wrongs, suppress his woes, Stifle each patriot thought as crime, And frame a lay to suit the time. Yet Guthrum hath a soul! and can Forgive a Minstrel and a Man, Who fain would, as he may, prolong The high conceit of Anlave's song, But fears to wake, 'mid weapons sharp, The strain that hovers round his harp.â XVII. âI swear by Woden!â Guthrum loudly cried, âThat, Minstrel, nought of harm shall thee betide, Sing what thou wilt! Nay, farther, if thy song Be worthyâeven though our name it wrong, By my good steel, and Denmark's Raven Black, I swear that fitting meed thou shalt not lack!â By these frank words the bard emboldened seemed, And sung: Song. âI, too, a solemn dream have dreamed! I stood, like Anlave, in high Woden's hall; Like Anlave, I beheld the warriors all; The awful silence of the vast abode I felt, like him, and saw the martial god! âSuddenly came a flying Female Form, She came, as sometimes comes a summer storm, When winds are brisk, when slender trees are bowed, And rainbow-fragments tinge the severing cloud! E'en so her coming stirred, enlivened all. Half flew, half walked she, through the spacious hall, And fronted Woden's throne. The warrior-train, In her, beheld a Chooser of the Slain! âBesides those twelve goddesses,â says Mallet, âthere are numcrous virgins in Valhalla. There business is to wait upon the heroes, and they are called Valkryior. Odin also employs them to choose in battles those who are to perish.ââNorthern Antiquities. âI come,â the Damsel cried, âfrom Holy Isle, I come from battle, and from burning pile. Blood flowed like water. Noble Aymund there, For breath was gasping in the smoky air. His blade, beside him, dripped with Saxon gore. Him I had chosen for mine own before; And, flying where the hero bleeding lay, I swiftly stooped to bear his soul away. Alas, I found before me there that hour, Th' unwelcome Spirit of a Mightier Power!â XVIII. Song continued. âHa! Mightier Power!â the startled god exclaimed, âThen it was not brave Aymund that you named? He is my son! Trained up to shed men's blood, Since he was boy he hath in battle stood!â âAyâso the Spirit told me,â thus again Took up the word the Chooser of the Slain, âBut now his part, she said, that warrior brave Shall learn, is not to slay mankind, but save! The sense of Beauty, and the power of Love, Sublimed in him, and hallowed from above, Shall touch the hero's heart with feeling strange, Shall touch, shall soften, and at last shall change! That matchless valour which 'gainst others burned, Shall 'gainst himself be resolutely turned, In his own bosom to destroy a foe Stouter than e'er he quelled by weapon-blow! And that once vanquished, his, thenceforth, shall be A higher and a nobler destiny! Blest shall he be in hall, and blest in bower, Blest in his love, his offspring, and his power! A land, made happy by his peaceful sway, To him through life shall willing homage pay; And to his soul shall, after death, be given The endless rapture of the Christian Heaven!â The Damsel ceased. On Woden fell a cloud; A deepening shadow dimmed each visage proud; Through the vast hall a flash of lightning broke; And thunder, following, startled me, and woke.â âHe paused, but warriors, at the Minstrel's pause, Rung not on hollow-sounding shields applause. XIX. You guess, my son, of all the listening throng, I understood the most of that strange song. But what was evident to me alone, How came it to the Saxon Minstrel known? Had he indeed, as bard, the gifted eye, Before whose sight both Past and Future lie? I doubted not. How, otherwise, could he Have any knowledge of my fate or me? I called him to my side, that I might say Such courteous word as Chieftain, praised, must pay For courteous song. I bade the Minstrel take A valued ring, They (the Scalds) were rewarded for the poems they composed in honour of the kings and heroes with magnificent presents; we never find the scald singing his verses at the courts of princes without being recompensed with golden rings, glittering arms, and rich apparel.âIbid. and wear it for my sake; Hinting the while, but in an under tone, That it were wise to quit the camp anon. He stole away, and well it was for him! For loured had many a visage, darkly grim, Upon the bard. I could but smile at thoseâ The scaldsâwhom rivalry had made his foes, And whose vain jealousy itself expressed In gibe malicious, and in taunting jest. â'Tis plain,â said Anlave, âthat the man hath quaffed The pure, the genuine, bard-creating draught.â The Danish fable of the origin of poetry may be briefly given here. KvÃ¡sir, a being formed by the gods, was murdered, and his blood being mixed up with honey, composed a liquor of such surpassing excellence, that whoever drinks of it acquires the gift of song. Odin, by a stratagem, succeeded in getting possession of it, and having swallowed the whole, transformed himself into an eagle, and flew off as fast as his wings could carry him. But Suttung, from whom he had stolen the liquor, also took on himself the form of an eagle, and flew after him. The gods, on seeing Odin approach, set out in the yard all the jars they could find, which Odin filled by discharging through his beak the wonder-working liquor he had drunk. He was, however, so near being caught by Suttung, that some of the liquor escaped by an impurer vent, and as no care was taken of thisâit fell to the share of the poetasters! âOh, doubtless,â Rolfe replied, âthe thing's of course; But thenâ'twere best say nothing of the source!â But graver character the warrior's ire Took 'gainst the Master of the Saxon Lyre: âThe wretch,â they deeply swore, âdeserves to bleed, For doing insult to our Country's creed!â Even on me their gloomy looks they bent, And muttered, audibly, their discontent, That Danish bounty should a meed supply To vagrant Nazareneâperchance a Spy! XX. Their wrath which, if its object had not flown, Might into outrage instantly have grown, Died by degrees awayâthe bard withdrawnâ When through the canvass gleamed the summer dawn! To sleep's demands the revellers 'gan to yield, Each taking for a couch his own broad shield, Where he had sat. Now reigned but stillness o'er The scene, where wildest mirth had reigned before. But soon, above their slumbers, from without, Broke other sound than song or wassail shoutâ Each startled warrior caught the loud alarms, And, half-awakened, grasped his ready arms! CANTO VI. I. He may of battles well discourse, my son, Who hath beheld a hundred lost and won; And who, through fields where warring thousands bled, Hath often chargedâretreatedâralliedâled. But that which roused the slumbering camp to strife, Was more a struggle stern for death or life, By men surprised in sleep, and unprepared, Who bravely fought, yet while they fought, despaired, Than ordered field which practised Leaders like To gaze uponâbefore a blow they strike; Where marshalled rank to rank their fronts oppose, And all is dreadful beautyâtill they close! II. The instant that the warlike summons rung, That instant Guthrum to his feet upsprung; Upsprung his valiant Chiefs, and hurried thence, Each to secure his separate post's defence. My earliest thought was faithful Ericâhe Who had imperiled everything for me; Nor was my other, younger friend forgotâ I bade them mark the fight, but mingle not. âFor if,â I said, âwe conquer, then believe The highest guerdon ye shall both receive. And if we fail, ye may, by acting thus, Escape the fortune they will deal to us. Ye can but share it, when all chance is gone!â E'en while I spoke, I did my armour on, And joining Guthrum's sideâmy ancient wontâ Rushed forth with him to meet the battle's brunt. We met, instead, our men recoiling back From the foe's first, and not least fierce attack, Which, with the utmost skill and vigour joint, Had been directed 'gainst our weakest point. By threat, by gesture, there compelled to halt, We led the fugitives to fresh assault, Repulsed, in turn, the coming Saxon might, Rolled back the entering current of their fight, Cleared our own trench betimes, at point of blade, And manned the breach which there the foe had made! III. Then first I saw the wildly-moving fieldâ The marshalled foe by hundreds stood revealed; On many a burnished helm and bright steel blade, The brilliant beams of early morning played. On their broad banner, which I saw advance, The Charger White of Wessex seemed to pranceâ It was not long ere they saw the White Horse, the Banner of Wessex, bearing down upon them. Alfred attacked their redoubts at Ethandun in the weakest point, carried them, drove out all the Danes, and, as the Saxon chronicles express it, remained master of the carnage. âThe Norman Conquest. A symbol that to every eye made plain The Saxon Alfred was in arms again! âI did not think,â the valiant Guthrum cried, As with stern glance the coming Steed he eyed, âWhen he so swiftly fled, yon burning noon, That we should meet againâat least so soon! Aymund, be firm! For see, with greatest force, The Saxons this way bear their heavy Horse! Now mark meâere this day-light fair hath ceased, My Raven on their Charger's flesh shall feast!â IV. Wave after wave, the surging war came on; Wave after wave dashed fiercelyâand was gone! For we were rocks, our sea-beat stance that held, And each successive waveâunmovedârepelled. Yet firmest rocks, that many a storm outbrave, In lapse of time must fall before the wave; And mortal nerves, whatever be their strength, If pressed continuously, must fail at length. Scarce could our arms the heavy falchion wield, And scarce, before us, bear the heavy shield; Yet still fresh numbers, vigorous as the first, Against our frail and sinking barrior burst. The trench, besides, that void erewhile had lain, Now filled and heaped with bodies of the slain, Supplied our foemen with a ghastly bridge, And readier access to the earthen ridge On which we fought. Our band, perforce, gave way, And in they rushed with more than torrent-sway! V. I tell, my son, but what I saw and sharedâ I wot not how the other Leaders fared; Wot not who yielded, who maintained, his post; I only know the day, by us, was lost! I only know that, save for prisoners ta'en, The Danish Camp contained no living Dane! And that brave Guthrum and myself, of those, Had now, alas, become the prize of foes! Me they at once disarmed, and would have slain; But one exclaimed: âHold! hold! It is the Dane Who 'scaped from us in yon wild moonlight scene: Better for him if there he still had been, Than reckoning with our victor King to-day!â The captors laughed, and dragged us thence away; Nor stayed their steps, until, in Guthrum's tent, Before the Saxon King they humbly bent. Forâmournful change to come from one defeat!â Their King now sat in Guthrum's honoured seat; And Guthrum stood, his final doom to hear, Where he had lately stoodâand none his peer! VI. I said, before the Saxon King they bent. I dreamed not, Harold, of the base descent! Proud as if still I led an army's van, I scorned to bend the knee to mortal man; And, though in regal presence, hardly saw The Prince to whom my captors knelt in awe. Contemning my own fate, aside I looked To see how his the noble Guthrum brookedâ His soul was strung up to the highest tone; His glance was free and fearless as my own! And had the Monarch given, that moment, breath To one brief word, and that brief word beenâDeathâ He would have marked, my son, no terror-sign Either on Guthrum's visage, or on mine. Brothers in many a former field of strife, And more than brothers now in parting life, Fixing on Alfred stern and scornful eye, Both would have diedâas heroes ever die! While glanced across my spirit some such thought, My stern and scornful eye the Monarch sought: But scarce I gave to my own sight beliefâ I sawâI sawâthe young Northumbrian Chief And the same instant I perceived, my son, The Saxon Monarch and that Chief were one! VII. The sullen mood, the dark and savage pride, Which had all form of reverence denied, At once gave way. Respect, esteem sincere, And certain recollections, did what fear Could never have achieved. I flew to bend Before my Victor, and to hail him friend; Though I had reason, as you now must know, For doubting if I still should find him so. But Alfred saw, and, starting from his seat, Came forthâas if an honoured guest to greet; My act of cordial homage stayed, and took My hand with warmest grasp, and kindest look. âI thank my God!â with emphasis he said, âThat thou, my friend! hast 'scaped the Saxon blade; And that brave Guthrumâthis, I know is he!â Survives it too, my other friend to be. All we of late discoursed ofâI and thouâ The righteous hand of Heaven hath altered now; Hath left me free a Monarch's power to use, Gently or sternly, as myself may choose; And doubtless, thy escape's implied distrust, Or worse, might seem to render sternness just. But spoken word, whatever may befall, A King of England never must recall! Vanquished, to thee I offer made, and will, As Victor, trust me, every part fulfil, On the conditions which we named.âMeantime, Not to arrest pursuit, were deepst erime! Ho! Kenric, Cerdic! haste ye both away! A white flag in the sight of all display, And let the heralds, in our royal name, A truce, an instantaneous truce proclaim!â VIII. Obedient to the Saxon King's behest, Had scarcely parted the brave Chiefs addressed, When tent-ward came a crowd with clamorous din, Who roughly dragged two other captives in; In whose sad looks, as soon as turned to view, I recognised my rescuers kind and true. âStern charge at once the King on Eric laid, Of kindness much abused, and trust betrayed; Attributed to him the damning guilt Of half the blood in that red morning spilt; And uttered high command, in the same breath, To lead the caitiffs out to instant death! The elder warrior, who had hung his head Submissively, now raised it up, and said: âThou art all good; a deep offender I; I merit death, it seems; and I can die. But hear, my King, a wretch's latest prayerâ Spare this poor Youth! the young and guiltless spare Still to my child a kind Protector be, And I will gladly perishâblessing thee!â The King was not unmoved, yet still his hand, Extended, seemed to indicate command; And still their forms the savage captors bent, In act to force them from the royal tent. IX. I interposed: âBrave Prince,â I humbly said, âThou hast, in me, excused the acting head; And, having kindly pardoned that which planned, Mayst well forgive the purely passive hand. Go, search thine army, and, from rear to van, Thou shalt not find, believe, a truer man Than this same Eric! 'Twas his Danish blood That for a moment checked his loyal mood. And Hengist, I have ample proof to show, Holds every foeman of his Prince his foe. Forgive them!â âNo, brave Dane, it may not be!â âYet hear meâyield the traitors up to me! To take the Old Man from his Monarch's sight, Will not by him be deemed a penance light; And for the Youth, I know a simple spell Wherewith to fix that Youth's allegiance well!â âThen deepest treachery were a virtue made; But be it so,â the King, relenting, said. At this old Eric threw him on the ground, And, clasping good King Alfred's knees around, With tears of joy the Monarch's feet bedewed. Erect the while, the youthful Hengist stoodâ âI have but little skill to plead or 'plain,â The Stripling said, âbut bring the bravest Dane Before my falchionâor the slanderer bring, Who dares to call me traitor to my King, And he, in combat, who beholds me flinch, Like vilest snake shall scotch meâinch by inch!â A murmur of suppressed applause went round, Nor royal Alfred at the blunt speech frowned. X. The noble Chiefs, on peaceful mission sent, By this time had returned into the tent, And now they made report, that, near and far, The hot pursuit was checked, and stayed the war. Here stood the Saxon's victor ranks, they said, Impatient all to find revenge delayed; While there, recovering heart, the routed Dane Was mustering fast his broken bands again; And, undismayed by recent overthrow, Was ready to inflict, or take, a blow. In sooth, so high appeared their mutual rage, 'Twas feared the armies yet might re-engage! The Monarch heard the risk; he heard appalled; And quickly to his standard-bearer called: âHo, forth with us!â And forth, with hasty stride, Across the field, where war had raged, we hied, Until we reached the narrow strip of green That stretched the dark and scowling ranks between. âHere,â cried the Monarch, âfull in every eye, The Saxon banner, let us raise on high; And, high beside it, give the flag to wave, Dear to each Dane, the flag of Guthrum brave!â 'Twas doneâand fairly floated into light The Raven Black beside the Charger White! Th' exulting Danes the signal's import knew, And loudly shouted as the banners flew. With fainter cheer the less-pleased Saxons hailed The sign that peace and amity prevailed. XI. The generous Monarch then, with air benign, Took in his own brave Guthrum's hand and mine, And pledged us solemnly his kingly troth, His word confirming by a needless oathâ That fair Northumberland should us obey, Nor e'en the Humber bound the Danish sway; Alfred granted them the most liberal terms, giving up to Guthrum, their king, all the territories of East Anglia and Northumbria, to be held tributary upon the easy conditions of his evacuating all the West Saxon dominions, and receiving baptism along with the principal chiefs of his army.âBritton's Beauties of Wiltshire. For thence to Thames, along the Eastern coast, Dominion wide should noble Guthrum boast. Upon the other part, we gladly sworeâ At first on ring and bracelet vowed to Thor, And then on holy relics, âGodrun,â says Thierry, âwith his captains, swore on a bracelet consecrated to their gods, that they would in all good faith receive baptism.â And Asser, in his Life of Alfred, says: âAlso they swore an oath over the Christian relics, which with King Alfred were next in veneration after the Deity himself.â shrinÃ¨d bones, That had, they said, been the Apostle John's,â To hold of him the Kingdoms he had named; To rule them by the laws himself had framed; Embrace the Christian faith; essay to win Our warlike followers from their rites of sin; And, lastly, guard the Isle, now common made, From every power that would its shores invade. âThese were the terms on which we rule obtained, And these the heralds to the hosts explained. Nor was it long ere, o'er the glittering fields, Rung wide the clangour of assenting shields! To strike his shield was invariably the way in which a Northman expressed his assent to any proposition. XII. No more of battle and of blood, my Boy! Thenceforward, all was triumph, all was joy! Men that had lately mixed in deadly fray, Were seen commingling now in friendly play. Guthrum, who in his secret soul despised Both creeds alike, was soon, with pomp, baptised,â The King himself, beyond his royal wont, Responding for him at the sacred font; King Alfred officiated as spiritual father to the Danish chief, who, putting the neophytical white robe over his armour, departed with the wreck of his army. The limits of the two populations were fixed by definitive treaty, sworn to, as its preamble set forth, by Alfred, King; Godrun, King; all the Anglo-Saxon wise men. and all the Danish people.âThe Norman Conquest. And, daily walking in his garment white, Full grimly, Harold, looked the Neophyte! For me, I waived the wished immersion then, Reserving for that holy rite the Glen, And hinted my desire that all the Danes Who pleased, should cleanse them of their moral stains In the same pure Northumbrian stream with me. âIt shall be so! and moreâOurself will see The rite performed,â the generous Monarch said, And instant order for the voyage made. Nor rolled there many summer suns away, Ereâflying all with flags and streamers gay, And followed by the city-crowd's acclaimsâ Two stately fleets were sailing down the Thames, Whose gallant Leader waved her canvass wings Proudly o'er Alfred, Guthrum, AymundâKings! XIII. As round the fair and winding shores we went, Rose on our right, the wood-crowned hills of Kent. The Essex marshes chanced that morn to be A bluely-sparkling, spacious, inland seaâ For as the tides their daily changes make, Those grounds are sometimes land, and sometimes lake. The marshes of Essex, at high water, would form a magnificent scene for centuries after the death of Alfredâthe embankments which prevent the Thames from overflowing them, having been constructed only about a hundred years ago. Faint o'er the vapourâmist and cloud betweenâ A Rainbow lent its beauty to the scene, Which I observing, to the Monarch told Its name and use affirmed by credence oldâ The arch of Bifrost, built across the sky, By which the gods descend, or mount on high. The gods made a bridge between heaven and earth; this bridge is the rainbow. Its name was Bifrost.âNorthern Antiquities. âA fanciful conceit,â he said, âin sooth, But not more beautiful than is the truth,â Which thou shalt hear, as, from God's Book sublime, It hath been rendered into Saxon rhyme: Song. THE BIRTH OF THE RAINBOW. The Flood was o'er. The earth began Its wonted garb to don; And all that now survived of Man, From Ararat looked on. Thence looked the white-haired Patriarch, Begirt with sons and daughtersâ Afraid as yet to disembark, And trust receding waters. For still, upon the verge of sight, Where sky and land combine, He fancied billows gleamed in light, And begged of Heaven a sign. âO God!â he cried, âwhose Mercy saves, Assure my sons and daughters, That they may trust yon distant waves, Nor fear returning waters!â No form or shape appeared thereat, God hath no shape or form; But a Voice came, more soft than that Of gale at ended storm! âTurn, second sire of men,â it said, âTurn ye, his sons and daughters, See on the cloud my sign displayed, Nor fear returning waters!â XIV. Song continued. They turned, and, full against the sun, A wondrous Bow there cameâ Of many dyes, and every one The purest of its name! âThat,â said the Voice, âshall be a sign To all thy sons and daughters, That never more will Wrath Divine Destroy the world by waters. âWhenever showers on earth descend, And sunbeams glance between, That bow of love shall brightly bend, That pledge of peace be seen. And long as Time holds on his march, Shall all Earth's sons and daughters With grateful spirit hail the archâ Triumphant o'er the waters!â Thus Heaven-assured, they sought the plain; Butâhumanâtimidâstill, Long shook they at each sound of rain, And at each swelling rill. But when on high the Token glowed, How joyed those sons and daughters! How knelt they, and adored the God Whose power had calmed the waters! XV. While thus the King half sung, at every word It haunted me that I had somewhere heard Rhymes chanted so before. But Alfred drew Again my notice to the scene in view. He praised its loveliness, and, certes, I Withheld no term of fitting eulogy, But said: âNo lands in lovely England shown, Can match the region which is now my ownâ The varied land that fronts the eastern waves, The land of mountains, andâââWhy not, of caves?â The Monarch slyly interposed, and laughed. Then added, gravely: âNot all Eric's craft, And not the deepest cave in northern glen, Could from my search have 'vailed to hide thee then, Had other cares my longer stay allowed! âI told thee, Aymund, by defeat unbowed, How willingly my faithful people all Would arm and muster at their Monarch's call. I had e'en thenâand by a surer scout Than thy friend Eric provedâsent summons out; And well I knew that, met on Selwood-lea, My friends, in arms, already waited me. That thou shouldst see their numbers, and thence know They were no feeble, despicable foe, And so report themâthis I did intend Ere thou to Guthrum's Danish camp shouldst wend. But this thy fond escape was found to mar, And I had left me no resource but war.â XVI. âBut why conceal thy rank?â âFair reason why! Thou, in the north, hadst friends, but none had I.â âI friends?â âAyâthousands, had our names been known, Who would have seized my Captive as their own. âOf all that people the Northumbrian plains, One half at least are Danes, or sons of Danes, The relics of past inroads, men who now Have wisely changed their armour for the plough; Thy future subjects, who received, unknown, The vanquished guardians of the Saxon throne, Until the time was ripe.âMy friends I found In arms assembled on th' appointed ground, And burning to be led to war. For me, I had designed a previous scrutiny, That I might learn how you in camp were laid, And how, and where, attack might best be made. I changed my wonted garb, a harp prepared, And as a wandering Minstrel forth I fared; With ease, admittance to your camp obtained, And e'en the royal tent of Guthrum gained. Nay, thou thyself didst praise my minstrel-skill, And pay itâwhich is something better still! Look here! nor need'st thou greatly blame thine eyes; They saw me, Aymund, under some disguise!â I looked, and lo! my own, my well-known ring Gleamed on the finger of the smiling Kingâ The very same which, as his song's reward, I had presented to the seeming Bard! The eye of Guthrum flashed. âBy mighty Thor, And mighty Woden!â it was thus he sworeâ Unmindful, or perhaps oblivious now, Of his late Christian rite and solemn vowâ âIf I had known thee! Past, alas, is past,â But that achievement should have been thy last!â The Monarch smiled the honest truth to hear, Rough from a heart that never knew a fear. XVII. Didst ever mark, in early summer, when The mist, at dawn, had filled some mountain glen, And, standing on its verge of dewy heath, You could but dimly see what lay beneath,â How soon, when Morning had begun to stream, Melted the mist before the warming beam, And gave the glen, with all its varied bloom, Its depth of woodbine, and its sides of broom, With its long rivulet's links of rosy light, As if by magic, to thy wondering sight? E'en so the words of Alfred rolled away The veil of mystery from his minstrel-lay! Its inspiration's source, erewhile concealed, In sudden sunshine lay at once revealed! And judge, my son, with what a thirsty ear I drank disclosuresânewâunhopedâand dear! XVIII. âAymund!â said Alfred, âwhen, at Lindisfarne, It was my hap thy princely rank to learn, Thy life, or ransom, was at first with me A cold affair of pelf or policy. But warmer feelings soon replaced the cold, When that poor Maiden innocently toldâ (The Maiden Bertha, whom my Sister chose To be the sole companion of her woes, Resigning, without one regretful sigh, The proud attendance of a time gone by!)â When Bertha told in what way ran the stream Of fancy, during thy delirious dream, And when, by certain words that chanced to slip, In private converse, from my sister's lip, I found, with small surprise, that in her heart Her bold Deliverer held an honoured part. For Woman's gratitude, my friend, will move, Ere well herself perceives it, into love, And sometimes all too quickly for controlâ Yet is Rowena high and firm of soul; And wert thou now to sue as Heathen Dane, Believe me, Aymund, thou wouldst sue in vain. But she will welcome, with a calm delight, Her Loverâcoming as a Christian Knight!â XIX. Here the King left me, for my heart, he knew, Required some time its transports to subdue, And then, returning, said: âThy realm's affairs, Henceforward, askâdemand thy gravest cares. Lookânow thou hast âregained thy high commandâââ He smiledâââlook to the lowly of thy land!â The rich and great have power themselves to guard; The honest poor man in his Sovereign's ward! The sentiments expressed in this passage, and elsewhere, are agreeable to the character and conduct of the Great Alfred, as described by Asser: âThe King, eager to give up to God the half of his daily service, and more also, if his ability on the one hand and his malady on the other, would allow him, showed himself a minute investigator of the truth in all his judgments, and this especially for the sake of the poor, to whose interests, day and night, among other duties of this life, he was ever wonderfully attentive.â To him thy bounties, with free hand, dispense; See justice done him; be his Providence. Yet be so from behind a prudent screen, That makes thy goodness rather felt, than seen. Yon Sun himself, with undiminished power, Is ever finest in his shaded hour, When his bright place in heaven is only known By the fine splendours all around him thrownâ Excessive splendours which, as men behold, Transmute the meanest clouds they touch, to gold! XX. âFrom out thy Chiefs, as far as in thee lies, For posts of power select the good and wise. I sayâand wise, for be it understood, Not always wise, alas! we find the good. But goodness, wisdomâin one soul combinedâ Form ever the best Ruler of mankind. Encourage artsâthe useful still the most, Yet never be the light and graceful lost; These are the lovely gleams whichâas they playâ Gild the dull vapours that would shade our day; Or moreâthese by supernal power are given, To tinge the else-bleak earth with hues of heaven! And, as the highest far these arts among, O cherish most the Bard's ennobling songâ Which to great actions gives deserved renown, Embalms their memory, and transmits it down; At the same time delights both soul and ear, And makes men Patriots as they lean to hear! XXI. âAkin to lofty song, its source the same, But speaking in a higher, holier name, And with superior powerâO reverence thou The Holy Faith that hath been taught thee now! Walk by its rule thyself, and gently draw Thy erring people to embrace its law, Whoâthus âmade happy by thy peaceful sway, To thee through life shall willing homage pay.ââ He smiled again, then said: âBe duly checked, In thee, the pride of wakening Intellect, Nor be thy reason borne along by it, An inch beyond the scope of what is writ. The virtue, Aymund, of a humble trust Becometh beings who are made of dust. What we are here, to us, my friend, is known; What we shall be, belongs to God alone. But safely in His care we may repose, Who cared for us ere Earth itself arose, Without presuming more of aught to know, Than He, to us, hath seen it good to show. Searching the Unrevealed, the strongest Mind Its perfect emblem in the Thames may find. See! howâa current deep, and swift, and strongâ It rushes, Aymund, in its pride along, As if of powerâwhen it at length shall gain The foamy margin of the onward mainâ To make a felt impression, far and wide, Upon green Ocean's unresisting tide! Alas for pride! 'Tis met by mightier force, Met, and rolled backward on its distant source, Compelled to re-survey each inland shore, Which it had passed, with so much pomp, before!â XXII. Much more the Monarch said, and I could tell; For 'tis a mournful privilege to dwell On these Memorials of a noble Mind, Which shone, on earth, a Star among mankind; But which, to earth, has long been setâto rise With fairer beams, and shine in other skies! Leaving an honoured name behind it here, To his own England, and to Glory dear! âBut the chill breeze that blows from Lindisfarne, Begins, my son, of coming night to warn, And I, it may be, do thy patience wrong, By tasking it with narrative so long. A very few more words will close it now, And then we will descend the mountain's brow. XXIII. Fair winds and rowers stout soon brought to land Our ships on Lindisfarne's accustomed strand, Where the good Abbot of the Holy Isle, On promise to rebuild his ruined Pile, With joy agreed t' administer the rite Of baptism to each Danish proselyte. Then marched we forth with banner and with brand, As if to war, across the lovely land. Peasants, in groups, on every verdant hill, Stood to behold us passing, mute and still, In wonder, doubtless, why such numbers then Should seek, in arms, the Valley of the Glenâ A peaceful vale and sweet, whose every lea Is all day rife with butterfly and bee, As if each flower the passing summer flings On its fair sloping banks, had taken wings! XXIV. The summer-morning sun, as we advanced, Full brightly on our armÃ¨d march had glanced; The quiet Till had brightly seen us through, And past the base of terraced Homilheugh; Whence the pleased eye saw, 'mid a spacious plain, The blossomed broom of Ewart's fair domain. The plain upon which stands the beautiful seat of Sir Horace St. Paul, Bart., was, at the time of Flodden Fieldâand probably for many years afterwardsâcovered with broom. But when we reached the destined river's edge, A sudden gloom had fall'n on bank and sedge. Dark clouds were mirrored in the gloomy stream; With frequent flash, the lightning 'gan to gleam; And, following fast, the thunder's sullen sound Was heard to mutter all the Mountains round! I felt, myself, a fear, and thought I saw, On many a visage round me, signs of awe. To the good Abbot I at once confessed The natural feeling that disturbed my breast. âIt seems,â I said, âas if the Thunder-Power I lately served, in yonder sky did lour On his Apostate Son! as if he spoke The wrath of an Immortal in each stroke!â XXV. âO rather say,â the holy Abbot cried, As, rapt, the dim and quaking hills he eyed, âSay rather thatâunseenâthe Heavenly Hosts Have on these mountain-summits ta'en their posts, And now, by turns, are uttering, from each height, Their gratulations o'er this sacred rite, Which brings the hundreds their glad eyes behold, Within their glorious Master's ransomed Fold! Green Howsden mutters, but the solemn tone Is not the thunder's, and is not his own! Nor are these rapid gleams mere lightning! nor Mere echoes these that come from Newton Torr! Their gladness now the Lantons loudly tell! And harkâhow loudly answers Yevering Bell! In every flash, in every peal is given A sign, a proof, that there is joy in Heaven!â He ceased. Poor Bertha's tale to me recurred, And now was sanctioned by the good man's word; His accentsâlike the thunderâseemed to roll, His glancesâlike the lightningâfired my soul! And from his lips when those brief words had flowed, Which dedicate the future life to God, I stoopedâthe Glen's pure waters o'er me ran; And I emerged, my son, a Christened Man! âI need not tell thee that each warrior brave At the same time partook the cleansing wave. XXVI. Jesu! at once the rolling thunder ceased; The clouds 'gan part, and gather towards the east; Out burst the sun, with brilliancy divine, Once more on mountain and on stream to shine; And, while bright showers were glancing down the gale, A gorgeous Rainbow spanned the glittering vale! No longer gazed on as the bridge of gods, By which Immortals reach their sky-abodes, But now believed a holy sign to be, The pledge of peace to men, of joy to me! Beneath its arch of glory, darkly stood That Castle strong, begirt with wave and wood, Which held, I knew, the all of human birth I longed to meet with now on God's good earth. And lo! from forth its portalâwhile the bow Of heaven above them kept its freshest glowâ Issued a long bright train of maidens fair: I asked not, Harold, if my Love were thereâ But flew, and, kneeling, clasped, on Glen's green side, The fair hand of my beauteous Saxon Bride! Here ended he his Taleâthat Warrior old, And 'twas the last time that the Tale he told; For soon thereafter, in his Fort of pride, In Bamborough Castle, he fell sick and died. He was not buried where he died, although The dust of kings reposed, in earth, below. Nor was he ta'en to royal York, where he Had wielded long the power of sovereignty, And where, in the old King's declining day, His Son had ruled with delegated sway. For his soulâwandering in the hour of deathâ With words like these had occupied his breath: âTo Newton's churchyard bear my corpse away, That when I rise at the great Judgment-day, There will my dearest friends rise with me!âthere My own Rowena with her shining hair; There little Edith, whom we lost a child, With her sweet aspect, and her ringlets wild, So like her Mother's; little Alfred, too, Will wake beside me, with his eyes of blue! There Eric, Hengist, will return to life; And Bertha thereâreluctantly his wife, But ever true and tender to the last;â All roused up by the Angel's trumpet-blast, And all at once to consciousness restored, Will mount the air with me, and meet the Lord!â His wish they reverenced, wild though deemed to be, And laid the King in Newton's cemet'ry; Where his rude Tomb successive races saw With less and less of wonder, and of awe, Until inscription, sculpture, even stone Had disappeared, and left the spot unknown! Forgive one lingering note! A thousand years From Aymund's death were ending, whenâwith tearsâ I saw an Old Man from his home conveyed, And in the same place reverently laid. My father died in 1809, and was buried in the churchyard of of Kirk Newton. I may be pardoned for adding a single memorial of him. He and two brothers, when children, had been left orphans, of whom my father was the eldest, and consequently the most capable of feeling the loss they had sustained. Having been told that his father and mother had gone to Heaven, he used to steal out of an evening, and watch the first stars that appeared in the west, fondly dreaming that they might be the eyes of the Departed, gazing upon the son of their love! The thought always filled his own eyes with tears, and sent him to his parentless home and bed to weep himself asleep!â There was poetry in that child's soul. He was a Peasant, whose long life had been Of toil and labour one unvaried scene. He fought no battles, save with Want. His name No splendour had, save that of honest fame. And when he died, no stone arose to tell Where, after all his ills, he sleeps so well. To meâwho missed him longest, mourned him mostâ Even to me, that Old Man's grave is lost, As much is lost to all that would explore, As His, who died a thousand years before. Both equal nowâno vestige to evince Where lies the Peasant, where was laid the Prince! My Blessing on. 1851. [In the farm-house of Threestoneburn, among the Cheviots, I have seen three generations of the same family, and have spent many happy hours with all of them.] My blessing on yonder wild mountains, On yonder wild valley between, And on the sweet cot and its fountains, The sweetest by wanderer seen! How gladlyâthe world's weary rangerâ My days in that cot could I spend, Whose door ne'er was barred on a stranger, Whose bedâne'er denied to a friend! The morn o'er the moorland was shining, A morn without one streak of gloomâ 'Twas splendour with beauty combining, The blending of sunshine and bloom! And the cot had each spellâwhen I found itâ The heart and the fancy to win; For all mountain charms were around it, And all mountain virtues within! O sweet was the flower of the hearther, As it bloomed in the sun and the dew; But a sweeter flower there he may gather, Who goes with a pure hand and true! For that cot has some lovelier blossoms Than even the heather suppliesâ The father's good heart in their bosoms, The mother's kind glance in their eyes! Fairest of all Stars. 1852. [In memory of Sarah, my eldest daughterâthe same who plucked the violet in 1825. See page 62.] Fairest of all Stars! star of the Even! See'st thou a Soul passâfairer than thou? Brief though the time since she left us for Heaven, Perhaps, in her journey, she passes thee now! Angels she wants not to guide or attend her, Certain and safe is her path through the skies; Ray as she was from the Source of all splendour, Back to that Source sheâinstinctivelyâflies! Spirits will hail her; sisters and brothers Give to her greeting a joyful responseâ O! will they talk of their father and mother's Death-darkened homeâwhich was bright with them once? Talk of it, blest ones! early selected! Memories of sadness no sadness will bring; Joy will seem sweeter for woes recollected, As Winter, remembered, adds beauty to Spring! You have Heard. 1853. [For the fairy tale of the Whistle, see Thorp's âYule-tide Stories.â Music by Jay.] You have heard,â said a youth to his sweetheart who stood, While he sat on a corn-sheaf, at daylight's decline, âYou have heard of the Danish boy's whistle of woodâ I wish that the Danish boy's whistle were mine!â âAnd what would you do with it? Tell me!â she said, While an arch smile played over her beautiful face; âI would blow it,â he answered, âand then my fair maid Would fly to my side, and would here take her place.â âIs that all you wish it for? That may be yours Without any magic,â the fair maiden cried; âA favour so slight one's good nature secures!â And she playfully seated herself by his side. âI would blow it again,â said the youth, âand the charm Would work so, that not even Modesty's check Would be able to keep from my neck your fine arm!â She smiled, and she laid her fine arm round his neck. âYet once more would I blow, and the music divine Would bring me, the third time, an exquisite blissâ You would lay your fair cheek to this brown one of mine, And your lips, stealing past it, would give me a kiss. The maiden laughed out in her innocent gleeâ âWhat a fool of yourself with the whistle you'd make! For only consider, how silly 'twould be To sit there and whistle forâwhat you might take!â The Peerage of Industry. 1853. [Written for, and recited at, the opening of the great Model Mill of Saltaire, near Bradford, where about seven thousand guests, nearly three thousand of whom were Mr. Salt's own work-people, sat down to a sumptuous dinnerâall in one room. The lines have been circulated wherever the English language is readâa distinction as much above their merit, as was the liberalityâworthy of the âLord of Saltaireââwith which they were acknowledged.] To the praise of the Peerage high harps have been strung, By Minstrels of note and of name; But a Peerage we have, to this moment unsung, And why should not they have their fame? 'Tis the Peerage of Industry! Nobles, who hold Their patent from Nature aloneâ More genuine far than if purchased with gold, Or won, by mean arts, from a throne! And of Industry's Nobles, what name should be first, If not his whose proud banquet we share? For whom should our cheers simultaneously burst, If not for the Lord of Saltaire? For this is his praiseâand who merit it not, Deserve no good luck should overtake themâ That while making his thousands, he never forgot The thousands that helped him to make them! The Peer who inherits an ancient estate, And glads many hearts with his pelf, We honour and love; but is that man less great, Who founds his own fortune himself? Who builds a town round him; sends joy to each hearth; Makes the workman exult 'mid his toil; And who, while supplying the markets of Earth, Enriches his own beloved soil? Such a man is a Noble, whose name should be first, In our heartâin our songâin our prayer! For such should our cheers simultaneously burst, And such is the Lord of Saltaire! For this is his praiseâand who merit it not, Deserve no good luck should overtake themâ That while making his thousands, he never forgot The thousands that helped him to make them! Who would not be Proud of Old England? 1853. Who would not be proud of old England, With her great heart both tender and strong? Aye ready to soften at sorrow, Aye ready to kindle at wrong! To her friends a tall rock of the desert, Whose fount with sweet water o'erflows; An Etna in red-hot eruption, And darting round deathâto her foes Those rights which the nations still sigh for, She, ages ago, made her own: No slave she permits in her borders, No tyrant she brooks in her throne! Supreme on her own mighty Island, With the sea for her subject, she stands; And millions obey her and love her, Who never set foot on her sands! We are loath to think Liberty mortalâ Undying we hold her to be; Yet Liberty's life is bound up with The life of this Queen of the sea! We Rear no War-defying flag. 1853. We rear no war-defying flag, Though armed for battle still; The feeble, if he like, may bragâ The powerful never will. The flag we rear in every breeze, Float where it may, or when, Waves forth a signal o'er the seas OfââPeace, Good-will to men!â For arms, we waft across the waves The fruits of every clime; For death, the truth that cheers and saves; What mission more sublime? For flames, we send the lights afar Out-flashed from press and pen; And for the slogans used in war, CryââPeace, Good-will to men!â But are there States who never cease To hate or envy ours? And who esteem our wish for peace As proof of waning powers? Let them but dare the trial! High Shall wave our war-flag then! And woe to those who change our cry Of âPeace, Good-will to men!â Bring out the Old War-Flag. 1854. Bring out the old War-flag! Long, now, it has lain, Its foldsârich with gloryâall piously furled; And the hope of our heart was, that never again Should we see it float forth in the wars of the world. For still we remembered the blood, and the tears, Both realâfor sight, not imaginedâfor song, That dimmed e'en its triumphs through many dark years, When it waved in the battles of Right against Wrong! But down with regrets! or leave them to our foes, Whose outrage forbids us at peace to remainâ And up with it now from its honoured repose, 'Mid the cheers of a people that cheer not in vain! They cheer to behold it once more coming forth, The weak to defend from the sword of the strong; Forâtrue to its fameâthe first flag of the North Will but wave in the battles of Right against Wrong! Take, Warriors of Freedom, the flag we bestow, To be shortly unfurled at the trumpet's wild breath! We give it you stainless; and Britons, we know, Will bring it back stainless, or clasp it in death! But why talk of death, save of death to our foes, When ye meet them in conflictâtoo fierce to be long? O! safe is the War-flag, confided to those Who fight in the battles of Right against Wrong! She tried to Smile. 1855. [âThe Empress endeavoured to smile, in acknowledgement of the cheers, but her feelings overcame her: she threw herself back, and gave way to a flood of tears.ââReport of the attempted assassination of the French Emperor.] She tried to smile, for she would fain Have so received her people's cheers; But her heart found the effort vain, And it gushed o'er in copious tears. Above the Empress, in that strife, Arose the Woman and the Wife. She turned to her imperiled mate Withâwho shall say what mingled pangs?â On whose attempted life the fate Of Europe, at this moment, hangsâ How looked he when thus sorely proved? He was the only one unmoved! Heaven-raised, Heaven-shielded, there he sat, Impassive as the mountain rockâ A thousand storms may blaze round that, It stirs not at the mightiest shock. The fountain in its breast may quiverâ Its aspect is the same for ever! And hides not He, beneath that cold, Calm front, a tender fountain too? And felt he not how sweet to hold The empire of a bosom true? And deemed he not each tear a gem Worth all that grace his diadem? O happy in this double sway Of heart and empire! Thou canst boast That were the empire wrenched away, The heart left, there were little lost; The heart which blesses now thy lot, Would make a palace of a cot! Our Nightingale's Fame. 1855. When a Knight of the old time was wounded in war, His lady-love flew to the fleld where he lay, Had him carefully borne to some castle afar, And tended his sick couch by night and by day. Pure, pure was the love that her fair bosom held, And pure was the feeling that woke at her name; But our own time has seen her devotion excelled, And her brightest fame darkened by Nightingale's fame. It was not a lover whose pallet she smoothed, She plied not her task in a castle's proud room; The poor, wounded soldier she tended and soothed, 'Mid the hospital's fetid and comfortless gloom! She talked to himâdyingâof life beyond earth, Till the soul passed, in joy, from the war-shattered frame; And for this she had left her fair home and bright hearth!â O! Mortal ne'er merited Nightingale's fame! The purest of earthly love ever is mixed With something of earth. On the one side all soul, All sense on the other, it hovers betwixt, Andâtouching on bothâbears a taint through the whole. But her love was free from the human alloy; 'Twas a flame from the Holiest's altar of flame!â She went forth an Angel of Mercy and Joy, And Angels might covet our Nightingale's fame! Sebastopol is Low! 1855. How eagerly we listen For the tidings which, we know, Must thunder from the Euxineâ Of the Russian's overthrow, Of the struggle, of the carnage, Redly heaping friend on foeâ When the last assault is over And Sebastopol is low! Think ye we fight for glory? We won it long ago! Or for a wider empire? Noâby our honourâno! But we fight for Freedom's empireâ And that shall wider grow, When the last assault is over, And Sebastopol is low! O'er the nations darkly pining In serfdom's night of woe, See! the clouds are being scattered, And the dawn begins to glow! And the lark of Freedomâsingingâ Through sunny skies shall go, When the last assault is over, And Sebastopol is low! Hark! heard ye not those boomings, Repeated deep and slow? 'Tis the voice of Freedom's triumphâ It is struckâthe glorious blow! And all through merry England Brave songs, to-night, shall flow; For the last assault is over, And Sebastopol is low! The Zephyr of May. 1856. [A Song of the Peace.] The spring will bring peace, as it brings the fine weather, The war and the winter will both have blown o'er; And joys, like the flowers upon green-sward and heather, Will bloom o'er the land in profusion once more. Fair eyes, dim with weeping now, then will be bright againâ No dewy violets brighter then they! True hearts, that are heavy now, then will be light againâ Dancing like leaves in the zephyr of May! Alas, there are hearts that, the higher our gladness, The deeper will sink in their fathomless woe; There are eyes to which spring will bring nothing but sadness, Since it cannot bring those whom the war has laid low! But God will pour balm into bosoms despairing; The Mourner, in time, will look upward and sayâ âHe died a brave death! he won peace by his daring!â And a proud sigh will blend with the zephyr of May. With flag by foes riddled, but O! never captured, Our warriors will bound again o'er the sea-foam; And the loved ones, left woful, will meet them, enraptured, And in triumph bear each to his now-honoured home. We have proved to the worldâand the world will rememberâ That to conquer in battle we still know the way! But though weâto the foeâare the blast of December, We areâto the vanquishedâthe zephyr of May! A Being there is. 1857. A being there is, of whose endless existence, No sane mind e'er doubted, or harboured a doubt; A Being with whom there is no time, no distance; Who pervades all within me, pervades all without. In my brain, at this instant, He marks every motion Of thoughtâas if no thought were moving but mine; Yet sees, the same instant, each whim and each notion In every quick brain from the poles to the line! Nor, while He is watching Earth's myriads, can it Be said that from any one orb He is far; No, He is as near to yon beautiful planet, His essence imbosoms the furthest lone star! The furthest lone star? It is language that laboursâ No star is, to Him, either furthest or lone; And the star we deem lone, may have millions of neighbours, Whose beams ne'er have yet through our atmosphere shone! These love-peopled worlds are the bright emanation Of goodness yet brighter, which words would but dim; And the meanest intelligent life in creation, Hath the care, the protection, the kindness of Him! If we think that He leaves us, we then are forgetting That He is the fixed, the unchangeable Oneâ The sun leaves not us, when it seems to be setting, 'Tis we who are turning away from the sun!</field>
