To the Reuerend Fathers also, the L. Bishops, and to all other the deuout Pastors and Superintendents, of the Churches of Great Britaine, and Ireland. George Wither, their humble Seruant, wisheth all encrease of Spirituall graces: and to their Christian disposure, submits Himselfe and this Endeauour. THE First song of Moses. Exod. 15. The Song. Then sang Moses and the Children of Israel this Song vnto the LORD, and spake, saying: Now to the Lord my song of praise shall be, Who hath a most renowned triumph woone: For in the sea, the horse and horseman he, Hath both at once together ouerthrowne. This is the Lord that makes me strong, Hee is my safety and my song; My God for whom I will a house prepare, My Fathers God whom I on high will reare. Well knowes the LORD to war what doth pertaine; And for that reason is the LORD his name: He, Pharo'hs Charr'ots, and his armed Traine, Amid the Sea ore'-whelming overcame. He, in the Ruddy-sea hath drown'd, His Captaines that were most renownd: The deeps a couering ouer them hath throwne, And to the bottome sunke they, like a stone. LORD by thy power thy right hand's famous grow'n, Thy right hand LORD, thy foe destroyed hath; Thou by thy glorie hast thy Foes ore-thrown; And stuble-like, consum'st them in thy wrath. Thou by thy nostrils angry blast, The waters backward driuen hast And (rowl'd on heapes,) the billowes and the sloud, In middle of the Sea, congealed stood. I will pursue them (thus the Foe did crye) I will ore'take them and the spoile enioy; My pleasure on them, now fulfill will I; With sword vnsheath'd my hand shall them destroy. Then with thy breath thou didst but blow; And ouer them the Sea did flow: Where they, the mighty waters sanke into, As we may see a peece of lead will doe. LORD, who like thee among the gods is there? In holinesse, so glorious who may be? Whose praises, so exceeding dreadfull are? Or who in doing wonders is like thee? Thy right hand thou aloft didst reare, And in the earth they swallow'd were: Whil'st thou, didst by thy mercy, forward lead, This people, whose redemption thou hast paid. Them, by thy strength, thou hast been pleas'd to bear Vnto a holy dwelling place of thine: The Nations at report thereof shall feare, And they shall grieue, who dwell in Palestine. On Edoms Dukes will horror fall; Yea Moabs mightie Princes shall With trembling shake, when they of this heare tell: And they shall faint that doe in Canaan dwell. By that great power, which in thine Arme thou hast, Let feare and terrour vpon them be brought: Stone-quiet make them till thy people passe; LORD, till this people pas, which thou hast bought. Then, to thy hill, let them repaire, LORD plant them there, where thou art heire: Eu'n where thy place of dwelling is prepar'd, That holy place, which thine own hands haue rear'd The LORD shall euer, and for euer raigne, No ending, shall his large dominion know; For, when as Pharaoh downe into the Maine Did with his Charr'ots and his Horsemen goe, The LORD the waues did then recall, And brought the sea vpon them all; Whil'st, through the place where deepest waters lye, The seed of Israel passed ouer drye. THE Second Song of Moses. Deut. 32 The Song. And Moses spake in the eares of all the Congregation of Jsrael; the words of this Song, vntill they were ended, &amp;c. To what I speake, an eare O heauens lend, And heare oh earth what words I vtter will, Like drops of raine, my speaches shall descend, And as the dew, my doctrine shall distill, As doth the raine that showreth small on tender slow'rs And as vpon the grasse doe fall the greater show'rs, For I the LORD'S great name will publish now. Vnto our God the glory render you. He is that Rock, whose Workes perfection are; For all his waies with Iudgement guided be: A God of truth, from all wrong-doing cleare, A truly iust, and righteous-One is He. Yet they with spots themselues defilde, Vnlike his Sonnes; And are a race of crooked, wilde, And froward ones. Vnwise and foolish nation, dost thou so Thy selfe vnto the LORD vngratefull show? Thy Father, and Redeemer, is not he? Hath he not made, and now confirm'd thee fast? Oh call to minde the dayes that older be, And weigh the yeeres, of many Ages past, Thy Father will, (if thou desire) Informe thee well; Thy elders, (when thou shalt enquire,) Can also tell How, the most-high did Adams Sonnes diuide; And shares for euery Kindred did prouide. How, he the Nations Limits did prepare, In number with the Sonnes of Israel, The LORD had in his people then his share; And Iacob, for his part allotted fell. Them, in a desert rude, he found, Possest of none: A place of terrour, and a ground Vast and vnknowne. He taught them there, he led them farre and nigh: And kept them as the apple of his eyes. Eu'n as an Eagle, to prouoke her young, About her neast doth houer here and there; Spread forth her wings, to traine her birds along; And sometime, on her backe, her younglings beare: Right so, the LORD conducted them, Himselfe alone, And for assistant, there with him Strange God was none: Them, on the High-lands of the earth he set, Where they the plenties of the fields might eate. For them he made the Rocke with hony flowe, They suckt out oyle from flints, and they did feed On milke of sheepe, on butter of the Cowe, Fat lambs and goates, and rammes of Bashan breed; Of wheat he gaue them for their food, The fullest seede, And they did drinke the purest blood The grape did bleed. But, here-withall; vnthankefull Israel, Soone fat became, and spurned with his heele. They waxed fat, and grosse, and couer'd o're; And then their God and Maker did forsake: Their Rocke of health regarded was no more, But with strange Gods him Iealous did they make: Yea, they with what was most abhor'd, His wrath entise; To deuils (not vnto the LORD) They sacrifice: To gods vnknowne, that new inuented were, And such, as their fore-fathers did not feare. They minded not the Rocke, which them begat, But haue forgot the God that form'd them hath, Which, when the LORD perceiu'd, it made him hate His sonnes and daughters, mouing him to wrath. I will, to marke their end, (saith he) Obscure my face; For they, vnfaithfull Children be, Of froward race: My wrath, with what was not a God they mou'd; And haue mine anger, with their follies prou'd. But, by a people, without being (yet) Their Iealous wrath, will I prouoke for this, And by a foolish nation make them fret, For in my wrath a fire enflamed is; And to the depth of hell it shall Deuouring goe, Earth with her fruits and mountaines all Consuming to. In heapes, I mischiefes will vpon them throw, And shoot mine arrowes, till I haue no moe. With hunger parched, and consum'd with heat, I will enforce them to a bitter end, The teeth of beasts, vpon them I will set, And the invenom'd dust-fed, Serpent send. The sword without, and terrour grimme Within shall slay, Young men, and maides, the babe and him Whose haire is gray: Yea, I had vow'd to spread them here and there, Vntill that men forget they euer were. But this, the Foe compel'd me to delay, Lest that their Aduersaries prouder growne, Should when they saw it; thus presume to say: This, not the LORD; but our high-hand hath done. For, they a people are in whom No Counsellis: And neuer will their dulnesse, come To iudge of this. Oh! would their wisedome, this might comprehend; And that they would consider of their end! How should one make a thousand runneaway? Or two men put tenne thousand to the foile; Except their Rocke, had sold them for a pray; And that the LORD, had clos'd them vp the while? For with our God their God compare They neuer may, And if our foes the iudges were, Thus would they say: But, they haue Vines of those that Sodome yeelds, And such as grow within Gomorrha fields. The Grapes are gall (that grow vpon their vine) Their Clusters, are extreamely bitter all, Yea, made of Dragons venome is their wine; And of the cruell Aspes infectious gall. And may I this forget to beare In minde with me? Or shall it not be sealed where My treasures be? Yes, mine is vengeance, and I will repay: Their feet shall slide at the appointed day. Their time of ruine, neare at hand is come, Those things, that must befall them, haste will make: For sure, the LORD shall giue his people doome, And on his Seruants will compassion take. Yea, when he sees, their strength is all Bereft and gone; And they shut vp in prison, shall Be left alone: Where are their Gods, become (then will he say) Their Rocke on whom they did affiance lay? Who eate the fattest of their sacrifice? Who, of their drinke oblations, dranke the wine? Let those vnso their succour now arise, And vnder their protection them enshrine. Oh! therefore now, consider this, That I am Hee; That I am Hee, and that there is No God with mee, I kill, and make aliue, I wound, I cure: And there is none, can from my hand assure. For, vp to heauen I my hand doe reare, And (as I liue for euer) this I say, If once I whet my sword, that sparkles cleare, And shall my hand to acting vengeance lay; I will not cease, till I my foes, With vengeance quite, Nor till I haue repaid all those That beare me spite: And in the bloud, which I shall make to flow, I'le steepe mine arrowes, till they drunken grow. My sword shall feed on flesh and bloud of those, That either shall be slaine, or kept in thrall, When I beginne to quit me of my foes. Then, with his people Ioy you kindreds all; For he their bloud (that serue him) will With bloud pursue; And all his foes repayeth still With vengeance due. But, to his land will mercy she wing be, And those that are his people pitties He. THE Song of Deborah and Barak. Iudges 5. The Song. Then sang Deborah, and Barak the sonne of Abinoam on that day, saying: Sing praises to the Lord That Isre'l to acquite, The people of their owne accord Went forth vnto the fight: You Kings giue eare, you Princes heare, I to the Lord will raise My voyce aloud, and sing to God The Lord of Isr'ell prayse. LORD, when thou wentst from Seir, When thou lef'st Edom field; Earth shooke, and heauen dropped there, The Clouds did water yeeld, LORD, at thy sight a trembling fright, Vpon the Mountaines fell: And at thy looke, Mount Sinai shooke, LORD God of Jsrael. Erewhile in Shamghar's dayes, Old Anah's valiant sonne, And late in Jaels time, the wayes Frequented were of none; The passengers were wanderers In crooked pathes vnknowne; And none durst dwell, through Jsrael But in a walled towne. Vntill I Deborah 'rose. I rose a mother here In Jsr'el, when new Gods they chose That fil'd their gates with warre. And they had there nor shield nor speare, In their possession then; To arme for fight, one Israelite, 'Mong forty thousand men. My hearts affection, set On Israels Leaders is; Who with the willing people met, Oh praise the LORD for this. Sing all of yee, who vsed be, To ride on Asles gray: All you that yet in Middin sit, Or trauaile by the way. Where they their water drew, Those places being cleare From noyse of Archers; Let them shew The LORD's vprightnes there. Through Jsrael all, the hamlets shall His righteousnesse record: And downe vnto the gates shall goe, The people of the LORD. Rise Deborah, arise, Rise, rise, and sing a song, Abinoams sonne, oh Barak rise; Thy Captiues lead along. By him made thrall, their Princes all, To the Suruiuer be, To triumph on the mightie one; The LORD vouchsafed me. A root from Ephraim, Gainst Amaleck arose, And of the people next to him, The Beniamites were those. From Machir, where good leaders are, Came well experienc't men: And they came downe from Zabulon That handle well the penne. With Deborah did goe The Lords of Isachar, Eu'n Isachar; and Barak to, Was one among them there; Who forth was sent, and downe he went, On foote the lower way. In Ruben there, diuisions were, Great thoughts of heart had they. The bleating flockes to heare Oh wherefore didst thou stay? In Ruben there diuisions were, Great thoughts of heart had they. And why did they of Gilead stay, On Iordan's other side? Or what was than, the reason Dan, Did in his Tents abide? Among his harbours nigh The sea, there Asher lay; But Zabulon, nor Nepthali. Did keepe themselues away: These people are, who fearelesse dare Their liues to death expose; And would not yeeld the hilly-field, Yet Kings did them oppose. The Cananitish Kings, At Tana'ch sought that day, Close by Megiddoes water springs; Yet bore no prize away. The Starres from out the heauens fought, Gainst Sisera they stroue: They in their course, and some with force, Away brooke Kishon droue; Old Kishon, that was long A famous Torrent knowne. Oh thou my soule, oh thou the strong Hast brauely trodden downe! Their horses by their prauncing high, Their broken hoofes did wound; Those of the strong, that kickt and flung, And fiercely beat the ground. A curse on Meroz lay, Curst let her dwellers be; The Angell of the LORD, doth say, Extreamely curse it yee The cause of this accursing is, They came not to the fight, To helpe the LORD, to help the LORD, Against the men of might. But Iael, Hebers Spouse, The Konite, blest be she, More then all women more then those, That vse in Tents to be. To him doth she, giue milks when he Doth but for water wish: She butter fets, and forth it sets Vpon a Lordly dish. Her left hand reacht a Nayle, A workmans hammer streight Her right hand takes, and therewithall, She Sisera doth smite. His head she tooke, when she had strooke His pierced temples through; He fell withall, and in the fall, Hee at her feete did bow. He at her feete did bow, Whom falling life forsooke; And Sisera his mother now, Doth from her window looke. Thus cries she at the lattice grate, Why staies his Charr'ot so, Returning home? oh wherefore come, His Charr'ot wheeles so slowe? There-with her Ladies wise, To her an answere gaue; Yea, to her selfe, her selfe replies, Sure sped, saith she, they haue. And all this while, they part the spoile; A damzell one or twaie Each homeward beares, and Sisera shares, A particolour'd pray. A pray discolour'd trimme, And wrought with paintings rare: Wrought through; and for the necke of him That taketh spoiles to weare. So LORD, still so, thy foes ore'throw, But who in thee delight, Oh let them be, Sunne-like, when he Ascendeth in his might. THE Song of Hannah. 1 Samuel 2. The Song. And Hannah prayed, and said. Now in the Lord my heart doth pleasure take, My horne is in the Lord aduanced high, Vnto my foes an answere will I make, Because in thy saluation ioy had I. Like thee there is not any holy one, For other Lord without thee, there is none. Nor with our God may any God compare; So proudly vaunt not then as heretofore; But let your tongues hereafter now forbeare; From all presumptuous words for euermore. For why the Lord's a God, that each thing knowes And all that is intended doth dispose. Their bow is broken now who were so stout; Girt round with vigor, those who stumbled are: The full, themselues for bread haue hyred out, Which they haue left to doe, that hungry were, The barren now, doth seauen children owne; And she that had so many, weake is growne. The LORD doth slay, and he reuiues the slaine; He to the graue doth bring, and backe he beares: The LORD makes poore, and rich he makes againe: He throweth downe, and vp on high he reares. He from the dust, and from the dunghill brings The begger, and the poore, to sit with Kings. He reares them, to inherit glories throne, Because the LORD'S the earth's supporters be; He hath the world erected thereupon; The footing of his Saints preserueth He, And dumbe in darkenesse sinners shall remaine; For, in their strength, are all men strong in vaine. The LORD, will to destruction bring them all, Eu'n eu'ry one, that shall with him contend, The LORD from heauen thunder on them shall, And iudge the world vnto the farthest end. He shall his King with strength enough supply, And raise the power of his Annointed high. THE Prayer of Nehemiah. Nehem. I. 5. The Song. Lord God of heauen, thou that art, The mighty God, and full of feare, Who neuer promise-breaker wert, But euer shewing mercy where, They doe affection beare to thee, And of thy lawes obseruers be. Giue eare, and lift thine eyes I pray, That heard thy seruants suit may be, Made in thy presence night and day; For Israels seed, that serueth thee: For Israels seed; who (I confesse) Against thee grieuously transgresse. I, and my fathers house did sinne, Against thy will haue we misdone; Our dealing hath corrupted bin, Law, or decree obseru'd we none: Not those Commands, which to keepe fast Thou charg'd thy seruant Moses hast. Oh! yet remember I thee pray, These words which thou didst heretofore Vnto thy seruant Moses say, If ere (saidst thou) they vexe me more, I will disperse them here and there Among the nations euery where. But if to me they shall conuert, To doe those things my lawes containe, Though spread to heauen's extreamest part I would collect them thence againe, And bring them there to make repose Whereas to place my name I chose. Now these thy people are of right, The seruants who to thee belong, Whom thou hast purchast by thy might And by thine Arme, exceeding strong. O let thine eare LORD I thee pray Attentiue be to what I say. The prayer of thy seruant heare, Oh heare thy seruants when they pray, (Who haue a will thy name to feare.) Thy seruant prosper thou to day: And be thou pleas'd to grant that he In this mans sight may fauour'd be. THE Song of King Lemvel. Prou. 31. 10. The Song. Who findes a woman good and wise, A Iemme more worth then pearles hath got, Her husbands heart on her relies, To liue by spoiles he needeth not. His comfort all his life is she, But euill none delights to doe, For wooll and flaxe, her searches be, And cheerefull hands she puts thereto. The Merchant-ship resembling right, She from a farre, her food doth fet. Er'e day she wakes, that set she might Her maides a taske; her houshold meat. A field she vieweth, which she buyes: Her hand doth plant a vineyard there. Her Loines with courage vp she ties, Her Armes with vigour strengthned are. If good her huswifery she feele, By night, her Candle goes not out. She puts her fingers to the wheele, Her hand the spindle twirles about. To such as poore, and needy are, Her hand (yea both) extendeth she, The winter, none of hers doth feare, For double cloath'd her houshold be. She makes her Mantles wrought by hand, And silke and purple cloathing gets: Among the Rulers of the land, Knowne in the gate, her husband sits. For sale, fine linnin weaueth she: And girdles to the Merchant sends. Her cloathings, strength and honour be: And Ioy, her latter-time attends. She speakes with wisedome, when she talkes, The law of grace her tongue hath learn'd. She heeds the way her houshold walkes; And feedeth not on bread vnearn'd. Her Children rise, and blest her call, Her husband thus applaudeth her, Oh thou hast farre surpast them all; Though many daughters thriuing are! Deceitfull fauour, quicklie weares, And beautie suddenly decaies: But if the LORD she truely feares, That woman well deserueth praise. The fruit her handy-works obtaine, Without repining grant her that: And giue her what her labours gaine, To doe her honour in the gate. THE First Song of Esay. Esay 5. The Song. A song of him whom I loue best, And of his vineyard sing I will. A vineyard once my loue poslest, Well seated on a fruitfull hill, He kept it close immured still, The earth from stones he did refine, And set it with the choisest vine. He in the mid'st a Fort did reare, A Wine-presse therein also wrought: But, when he look't it grapes should beare, Those grapes were wilde one, that it brought, Ierusalem come speake thy thought, And you of Iudah, Iudges be, Betwixt my vineyard here and me: Vnto my Vineyard what could more Performed be, then I haue done? Yet looking it should grapes haue bore Saue wilde ones, it afforded none. But goe to, (let that now alone) I am resolu'd to shew you to, What with my Vineyard I will doe. The hedge I will remoue from thence, That what so will deuoure it may, I will breake downe the walled fence, And through it make a trodden way. Yea, all of it, I waste will lay. None shall to digge, or dresse it care But thornes, and bryars it shall beare. The Clouds I also will compell, That there no raine descend for this: For loe, the house of Israel The LORD of Armies vineyard is; And Iudah is that plant of his; That pleasant one, who forth hath brought, Oppression, when he iudgement sought. He Iustice sought but found therein, In stead thereof a crying sinne. THE Second Song of Esay. Esay 12. The Song. Lord I will sing to thee, For angry though thou wast, Yet thou with-drewst thy wrath from me, And sent me comfort hast. Loe, God's my health; on whom, I fearelesse, trust will lay, For oh the LORD, the LORD's become My strength, my Song, my stay. And you, with Ioy (for this) Shall water fetch away, Out of those wels, where safetie is: And thus, then shall you say. Oh sing vnto the LORD, His Name and works proclaime Vnto the people beare record, That glorious is his Name. Vnto the LORD oh sing: For, wonders he hath done, Yea, many a renowned thing, Which through the earth is knowne. Sing forth, aloud all yee, That doe in Sion dwell: For loe, thy holy-One in thee, Is great, oh Israel. THE Third Song of Esay. Esay 26. The Song. A citty now haue we obtain'd, Where strong defences are, And God saluation hath ordai'nd, For was and Bulwarkes there. The gates thereof wide open set; Those righteous people who The Truths obseruers are, may get Admittance thereinto. There, thou in peace wilt keepe him sure, (Whose thoughts well grounded be) In peace, that euer shall endure, Because he trusted thee. For-euermore vpon the LORD Without distrust depend, For in the LORD, th'eternall LORD, Is strength that hath no end. He makes the lofty City yeeld, And her proud dwellers bow: He layes it leuell with the field, And with the dust below. Their feet, who poore and needy are, Their feet thereon shall tread: Their way is right that righteous are Whose path thou well dost heed. Vpon thy Course of iudgements wee, Oh LORD attending were, And to record thy Name, and Thee, Our soules desirous are. On thee, my minde with strong desires Is fixed in the night, And after thee my heart enquires, Before the morning light. For, when thy righteous Iudgements are Vpon the earth discern'd By those that doe inhabite there, Vprighnesse should be learn'd. Yet sinners for no terror will, Iust dealing vnderstand: But they continue doing ill, Eu'n in the righteous land. Vnto the glory of the LORD, They will not heedfull be: Thy hand aduanc't on high, oh LORD, They will not daigne to see. But they shall see, and see with shame, That doe thy people spight: Yea, from thy foes shall rise a flame, That will deuoure them quite. Then LORD, for vs, thou wilt procure, That wee in peace may be: Because that eu'ry worke of our, Is wrought for vs, by thee. And LORD our God, though we are brought, To other Lords in thrall: Of thee alone shall be our thought, Vpon thy name to call. They are deceast and neuer shall, A farther life obtaine: They die and shall not rise at all, To tyrannize againe. For to that end thou visited, And wide dispers't them hast: Vntill their fame was perished, And vtterly defac'st. But LORD, encrea'st thy people are, Encrea'st they are by thee: And thou art glorified as farre As any lands there be. For LORD, in their distresses, when Thy chast'ning on them lay: They vnto thee did hasten then, And without ceasing pray. As she with Childe is pain'd when as Her throwes of bearing be: And cryes in pangs; before thy face, Oh LORD, so fared We. We haue conceiu'd, beene pain'd, and all Was for a windie birth: The world no safetie yeeld's; nor fall, The dwellers of the earth. Thy dead shall liue; they rise againe With my dead body shall: Oh you, that in the dust remaine, Awake and sing you, all. For as the dewe doth hearbs renewe, That buried seem'd before: So earth shall through thy heau'nly dewe, Her dead aliue restore. My people, to thy Chambers fare, Shut close the dore to thee; And stay a while (a moment there) Till past the furie be. For loe, the LORD doth now arise; He commeth from his place; To punish their impieties, Who doe the world possesse. And now the earth no longer shall, The blouds in her conceale: But shee, shall be compelled all Her murthers to reueale. THE Prayer of Hezekiah. Esay 37. 15. The Song And Hezekiah prayed vnto the LORD: saying. O lord of hoasts, and God of Israel, Thou who betweene the Cherubins dost dwell, Of all the world thou God alone art King, And heau'n and earth vnto their forme did'st bring. Lord bow thine eare, to heare attentiue be; Lift vp thine eyes, and daigne oh LORD to sea What words Senacharib hath cast abroad: And his proud message to the liuing God. Truth LORD it is, that lands, and kingdomes all, Haue to the Kings of Ashur beene a thrall: Yea, they their Gods into the fire haue throwne, For Gods they were not, but of wood and stone: Mens work they were, men therfore spoil'd them haue. Then from his power, vs LORD our God now saue, That all the kingdomes of the earth may see, Thou art the LORD, and onely thou art hee. Hezekiahs song of Thanksgiuing. Esay 38. 10. The Song. When I suppos'd my dayes were at an end, Thus speaking to my selfe, I made my moane: Now to the gates of Hell I must descend, And all the remnant of my yeares be gone, The Lord (ah mee) the Lord I cry'd Where now the liuing be, Nor man that doth on earth abide, Shall I for euer see. As the remouing of a Shepherds tent, Or as a Weauer cuts his webbe away, My dwelling so; yea, so my age was spent, And so my sicknesse did my life decay; Each day, ere night should end the same My death expected I, And euery night ere morning came, I did suppose to dye: For he so Lyon-like my bones did breake, That I my life accounted scarce a day; A noyse I did like Cranes or Swallowes make, And at the Turtle I lamenting lay; My fainting eyes I vpward cast, And thus my moane did makes; Oh, I extreamely am opprest, For me, LORD vndertake. What shall I say? his word to me he gaue, And as he promis'd, he performed it; For which, I will not whil'st that life I haue, Those bitter passions of my soule forget: But all that after me suruiue, Yea all that liue, shall know, How thou my spirit didst reuiue, And health on me bestow. Vpon my peace, did bitter sorrowes come, But in the loue which to my soule thou hast, The all-consuming graue thou keptst me from, And my offences all behind thee cast. For neither can the graue, nor death, Or praise or honour thee, Nor are they hopefull of thy truth That once entombed be. Oh, he that liues; that liues as I doe now, Eu'n he it is that shall thy praise declare; Thy Truth the father to his seede shall show, And how, oh LORD, thou me hast dain'd to spare, And in thy house (for this) will we, (Oh LORD throughout our dayes) On instruments that stringed be, Sing songs vnto thy praise. THE Prayer of Daniel. Dan. 9. 4. The Song. Lord God almighty, great and full of feare, Who alwayes art from breach of promise free, And neuer fayling to haue mercy where They doe obserue thy lawes and honour thee. We haue transgrest; oh! we, haue euill done. We disobedient and rebellious were; For, from thy precepts we astray are gone, And from thy iudgements we departed are. We did thy seruants prophesies withstand, Who, to our Dukes, our Kings, and Fathers came, And vnto all the people of the land, Proclaimed forth their message in thy name. In thee oh LORD, all righteousnesse hast thou, But open shame to vs doth appertaine; As fares it with the men of Iudah now, And those that in Ierusalem remaine. And to all Isra'l, through those Countries all, In which, they far or nigh dispersed be, Because of that transgression, wherewithall They haue transgressed and offended thee. To vs, our Kings, our Dukes, and Fathers doth Disgrace pertaine (oh LORD) for angring thee: Yet, mercy (LORD our God) and pardon both To thee belongs, though we rebellious be. For, as for vs, we sore haue disobey'd The Lord our God his voyce, and would not heare To keepe his lawes, which he before vs laid, By those his seruants, which his Prophets were. Yea, all that of the race of Isra'l be; Against thy law extreamely haue misdone: And that they might not listen vnto thee, They from thy voice, oh LORD are backward gone; Which makes both Curse and Oth on them descend, That in the Law of Moses written was; The seruant of that God whom we offend, And now his speeches he hath brought to passe. On vs, and on our Iudges he doth bring That plague, wherewith he threatned vs and them, For vnder heau'n was neuer such a thing As now is acted on Ierusalem. As Moses written Law doth beare record, Now all this mischiefe is vpon vs brought, And yet we prayed not before the LORD, That leauing sinne, we might his Truth be taught. For this respect, the LORD in wait hath laid, That he inflict on vs this mischiefe might; And seeing we his voyce haue disobay'd. In all his workes, the LORD our God's vpright. But now, oh LORD our God, who from the land Of cruell Ægypt brought thy people hast; And by the power of thine almighty hand, Atchieu'd a name which to this day doth last: Though we haue sinned, and committed ill; Yet LORD by all that righteousnesse in thee, From thy Ierusalem, thy holy hill, Oh let thy wrath and anger turned be. For by those wicked things which we haue don, And through our fathers sinnes; Ierusalem, Yea, thine owne people haue the hatred won And the reproach of all that neighbour them. Now therefore to thy Seruant's suite encline, His prayer heare our God, and let thy face, Eu'n for the LORDS deare sake, vouchsafe to shine Vpon thy, now forsaken, holy place. Thine eares encline thou, oh my God, and heare; Lift vp thine eyes, and vs oh looke vpon; Vs, who forsaken with thy Citty are, The Citty, where thy name is called on. For we vpon our selues presume not thus, Before thy presence our request to make, For any righteousnesse that is in vs, But for thy great and tender Mercies sake. LORD heare, forgiue oh LORD, and weigh the same, Oh LORD performe it, and no more deferre, For thine owne sake, my God; for by thy name, Thy Citty, and thy people called are. THE Prayer of Ionah. Ionah 2. The Song. In my distresse I cry'd to thee oh Lord, And thou wert pleased my complaint to heare, Out from the bowels of the graue I roar'd, And to my voyce thou didst encline thine care, For I amid the Sea was cast, And to the bottome there thou plung'd me hast. The flouds, about me rowling circles made, Thy waues, and billowes, ouer-flow'd me quite, Wherewith (alas) vnto my selfe I said, I am for euer-more depriu'd thy sight. Yet once againe, aduance shall I, Vnto thy holy Temple-ward mine eye. Eu'n to my soule, the waters clos'd me had, Or'e-swallow'd by the deepes I there was pent, About my head the weedes a wreath had made, Vnto the hils foundation downe I went. And so, that forth I could not get, The earth an euer-lasting barre had set. Then thou oh LORD, my God, oh thou wert he. That from corruption didst my life defend, For when my soule was like to saint in me, Thou didst oh LORD into my thoughts descend. My prayer vnto thee I sent, And to thy holy Temple vp it went. Those who giue trust to vaine and foolish lies, Despisers of their owne good safetie be: But I will offer vp a sacrifice Of singing praises, with my voice to thee; And will performe what vow'd I haue: For it belongs to thee, oh LORD to saue. THE Song of Habakkvk. Habak. 3. The Song. Lord, thy answere did I heare, And I grew therewith afraid. When the times at fullest are, Let thy worke be then declar'd: When the times Lord full doe grow, Then in anger mercy show. The Almighty God came downe, He came downe from Theman-ward, The eternall holy One, Selah. From mount Paran forth appear'd. Heau'n couering with his raies, And earth filling with his praise. As the Sunns is, was his light, From his hands there did appeare Beaming rayes, that shined bright, And his power is shrouded there. Plagues before his face he sent, At his feet hot coles there went. Where he stood, he measure tooke Of the earth, and view'd it well; Nations vanish't at his looke, Auncient hils to powder fell. Mountaines old east lower were, For his waies eternall are. Cushan tents I saw diseas'd, And the Midian Curtaines quake, Haue the flouds LORD thee displeas'd? Did the flouds thee angry make? Was it else the sea that hath; Thus prouoked thee to wrath? For thou rod'st thy horses there, And thy sauing Chatto'ts through: Thou didst make thy bowe appeare. And as hath beene by a vowe To the tribes agreed vnto; Thou perform'dst thy promise so. Selah. Thou didst cleaue the earth and make Rifts, through which did riuers flow: Mountaines seeing thee did shake, And away the flouds did goe. From the deepe a voice was heard, And his hands on high he rear'd. Both the Sunne and Moone did stay, And remou'd not in their spheares: By thine arrowes light went they, By thy brightly-shining speares: Thou in wrath the land did'st crush, And in rage the Nations thresh. For thy peoples safe reliefe, With thy Christ for ayd went'st thou, Thou hast also pierst the Chiefe, Of the sinfull houshold through. And displaid them, till that bare, From the foot to necke they were. Selah. Thou, with weapons of their owne, Didst their armies Leader strike: For, against me they came downe, To disperse me whirle-winde-like. And they Ioy in nothing more, Then vnseene to spoile the poore. Through the Sea, thou mad'st a way, And did'st ride thy horses where Mighty heapes of waters lay. I thereof report did heare: And the voice my bowels shooke, Yea my lippes a quiu'ring tooke. Rottennesse my bones possess, And a trembling ceazed me, I that troublous day might rest. For, when his approches be Vp vnto the people made, Then his troupes will them inuade. Bloomelesse shall the fig-tree be, And the vine no fruit shall yeeld, Fade shall (then) the oliue tree; Meat shall none be in the field: Neither in the fold nor stall, Blocke, or heard, continue shall. Yet the LORD my ioy shall be, And in him I will delight. In my God that saueth me; God the LORD, who is my might. And so guides my feet, that I, Hinde-like, walke my places high. FINIS.</field>
