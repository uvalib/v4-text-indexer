      <field name="fulltext">SIR LANCELOT: A LEGEND OF THE MIDDLE AGES. DEDICATION. Dear Brother! while the murmurs of my song In refluent waves were dying on my ear, The spoken music blending with the thrills Of that unuttered sweetness, which remains A cherished refuse in the poet's soul, Still to distinguish him from all the hearts To which, by love constrained, he hath resigned So much of his interior self,âand while I listened, like a practised mountaineer, To my own voice rebounding from the heights Of song, redoubled and prolonged returns Of pleasant echoes,âfrom the far-off South Came welcome news of thee, my dearest Friend! Thou spakest in thine own most beautiful way, And in the sunny visionary style Of thy strange solemn language, of the lights In those new skies, the Cross with starry arms, Palpably bending at the dead of night, The star-built Altar, Noe's sheeny Dove Still winging her incessant flight on high, The definite Triangle, and other such, Girt with huge spaces of unstarry blue, As sacred precincts round about them spread, Through which the eye, from all obstruction clear, Travels the heavens at midnight, and salutes Those orbÃ¨d constellations hung thereon Like festal lamps on some cathedral wall;â Emblems of Christian things, not pagan names That nightly desecrate our northern skies. Thus with thy spirit softly overshadowed By the most brilliant umbrage of those stars, Thou spakest of the snowy albatross, Sailing in circuits round thy lonely bark, Fondling its foamy prow as if it deemed, And not unjustly, its companionship A solace to thee on the desert waves; And underneath the great Australian trees A light was in strange creatures' wondering eyes,â How solemnly interpreted by thee! O it was all so beautiful, so strange, And with its current intercepted oft With place for some endearment of old love, I thought in thy wild strain how passing sweet The poetry of those far southern seas! Few days elapsed: there came another strain, Fresh poetry from those far southern seas! It sang of sickness and the fear of death, Of suffering gently borne for love of Christ, Who calls us to His service as He wills, Not as we choose; and, mingling with the strain, Broke forth thy simple and courageous words And peaceful trust, as happy and as bold As a child's prayer. And wilt thou think it wrong, That, when I prayed and wept and deeply mourned, There was a pleasure in my mourning, such As I have never felt in love before? For who that doth remember thee, how pale! How gentle! but would smile for very faith, As Abraham smiled, at thine heroic words, Which mate thine outward aspect so unfitly? Ah! that was poetry tenfold more sweet Than when thou sangst of stars, and ocean birds, And wondering creatures underneath the trees! O more than Brother! my impetuous heart, Nurtured too much on volatile impulses, In loving thee hath learned still more to love, And study with a covetous design, The science of thy quiet nature, calm, Profoundly calm amid all cares and doubts, As though thy faculties had never had, Or left and lost in thy baptismal font, All power of self-disturbance, so serene The unsuspicious greatness of thy virtue, Thy simple-tongued humility, and love Too self-forgetting to have much of fear! Like one who sits upon a windy steep, And looks into a placid lake below Bright in the breezeless vale, so have I gazed, With long affection fathomed to its depths, Into the inspired tranquillity of heart On thy scarce ruffled innocence bestowed. Dear Friend! I speak bold words of praise, and tears Warrant my boldness, for I know full well Thine eye will never see what would have pained Thy lowliness: that supernatural calm Of thy pure nature will be deeper still, Unutterably deepened, ere my words, Not written as to one alive, shall reach The island of thy gradual martyrdom. O no! thou wilt be once more at my side, A help to my weak purposes, an arm Invisible, in intercession strong, No part of this half dead, half dying world, But to the region of the living gone To pray for us, and to be reached by prayer. When these poor lines have travelled to that shore, Distance and exile will have fallen from thee, Sun-withered wreaths, before the eye of death; Thou wilt be in my neighbourhood again, Again come home unto my soul's embrace, No more the frail and wasting Missionary, But the high Mate of Angels and of Saints! Then let this song be dedicate to thee! If life be thine, forgive these words of praise,â Thou knowest they are my friendship's first offence. Should not this song be thine, all mountain-born? Are not its verses laden with sweet names, Which to our hearts are poems in themselves? And unnamed landscapes are there, singular trees, Spots of remembered sunshine or soft shade, And unforgotten fabrics in the clouds, Farms on the heath, and fields beside the town, Haunts by the mere, choice gardens of the poor Oft chance-discovered, O how much beloved And prized by us, as luxuries that belonged To over-tasked yet cheerful cottagers Whose servants we, as priests, would fain become! Such things are ever floating on my song, Sequestered places, household scenes, inviting Through language more descriptive than their names A pleased detection from thy mindful heart. Did we not learn our poetry together, And sing those spousal verses to each other, Among the glorious hills whose kindling heights Gleam like familiar beacons on its course? Was there, except thy modesty, and growth In meek self-sacrifice for Holy Church, Was there one difference 'twixt our blended souls? O my sweet, honoured Friend! admiring love Suesâthou remember'st how it spake of old By the chill-flowing Rothay in the nightâ Acceptance now for this religious song. Brother! thou wert within me and around me As it sunk down, and in my love for thee,â Admonished by thy sufferings to a strain Even yet more Christian,âin my love for thee The measure tremulously fell away, Falling, where I would leave it now for ever, Even at thy feet, to be mine image there, With docile admiration looking up Hourly in thy perpetual downcast eyes! BOOK I. THE ASH-TREE HERMITAGE. There is a sound in England, from the shores Unto the midland vales, from London streets To the deep chase where yet a Saxon thane In his rude homestead lingers, keeping court Among his rustic serfs. The realm is stirred, For the Crusaders have returned. No hour Of day or night but at the various ports, The island round, some straggling bark arrives. The very hostelries are surfeited With guests, and armÃ¨d men in wassail drowned, And prattling squires, not seldom with a gift Of no mean minstrelsy and racy verse; Who sang adventures, thousandfold, by sea Endured, or with a blither interest Encountered often in the chance delays At foreign harbours,ânarratives that might Outdo the Cycle of Returns from Troy For various intermingling of fierce war, And love as fierce, and passionate rivalries, And manly warriors sickening for their homes, And of that sickness miserably cured When home was gained, and monasteries filled With penitents and world-worn sinners, men Whose hearts were aged with pleasure, and, mid these, A gentler sort, whose souls uncommon grief Had disenthralled from earth and love of life. O could we waken in the woods or hills, By city gate, or bare refectory, Or green baronial tower, the voices old Of ballad-singers, errant, or retained Familiars of the banquet, not the cloud Of beautiful, pathetic song that hangs Upon MycenÃ¦'s cheerless mountain-slope, Or lone Itaki's sweetly foliaged cliffs Which the cool sea-breeze fans incessantly,â Not this could equal for true touching strain, Breathed from the sanctuaries of private life, That drama of a thousand ballads, once Floating o'er England and rehearsing there The feats and perils of the homeward-bound Crusaders, daily listened to with tears, And deeply lodged within the popular heart. Behold! on hill and dale the autumnal sun, Both when he rises up and when he sets, Sheds a wan lustre o'er some cavalcade, Threading the watery dells, or upland slopes Ascending, through the labyrinthine woods Gleaming with slow advance, or straggling now On the green level of the chalky downs. Some knight mayhap returns unto his tower, Some baron to his castle, or a monk, Wayworn and yet reluctant, seeks once more His woodland abbey,âan uneasy man, Who in the dangerous cheer of pilgrimage Had satisfied an ardent temper, chafed With ritual and those even sanctities Of cloistral occupation. Often too From out the litters, shivering in the breeze, Some eastern beauty, dark-eyed foreigner, Looked forth and chided in an uncouth tongue The warrior who reined in his steed close by; While hourly from the hall his anxious wife, To whom the last few hours of widowhood Less tolerable seemed than years had been Before, watched for the spearmen on the hill, And little dreamed how terrible would be The disenchantment of their meeting. Yet Not wanting in the breadth of this fair land Approved fidelity, and vows renewed In tenderest einbrace, surprises sweet At the tall striplings, the domestic knights Of their lone mother, whom the sire had left Wanting and not conferring aid, and girls Confused before the keen admiring gaze Of the fond knight, unused to read therein The affectionate rights of his paternal eye. And not forgotten is the chaplain greyâ But that his voice was somewhat more unclear Least altered of the household, save the hound, The lazy sleuth-hound couched upon the hearth By the warm faggots, yet unrecognized, A second generation since the knight Had sailed for Palestine. And, now and then, With gay pretence of needless ministries, Old servants in their love, the young no less Through curiosity, intruded there To see their master, and with bustling cheer Pressed their obtrusive hospitality Upon their new-come fellows. O there were Evenings in England then of such a bliss As might for unreproved intensity Of native feeling elsewhere have no mates,â Evenings whose innocent obscurity Outweighed whole years of trial, there compressed Into impassioned hours of transport. Thus Through the fair counties of the busy land, All thoughts were drawn and gathered into one,â The travel-worn Crusaders had returned,â Unwelcome, shall I say, or welcome? Ne'er Did motives blend with such strong interchange As then, such mingling of an affable joy With fears unspoken, and affrighted thought Lest for the past there should a reckoning come. And sometimes loud repining, unashamed, In graceless speech broke forth. Elsewhere perchance Might feeling fluctuate in some unpoised, And natural piety not seldom hang Too nicely on the balance. In that day Might Angels' eye have seen in human hearts How passion intersected passion; and truth Being with untruth at war, how each was then Involved with each, while falsehood truth might seem, Truth falsehood, mutually confused. Perchance Long centuries of feud might roll away Before the national manners should run clear Of this unholy trouble at men's hearths, Disturbance of the genial charities And moral instincts of our social life, Recovering, if recovered it might be, The dignity of simple-hearted ways. Why cometh not Sir Lancelot De Wace? His hall stands empty where the silver Kent Turns seaward, sweetly murmuring as he pours Prone o'er the pebbly bed his frugal stream. The woodlands echo not the horn; the sea Hard by shines idly in the summer sun, Or, when the tide is out, the fearless gulls Pace leisurely upon the glossy sands. The heron by the brook scarce lifts his head To scan the passenger: upon the hearths No hospitable faggots burn, or lights From the long front of windows nightly glance Through the low woods, like rising stars that mount Above the horizon; and the village poor, That sought the hall for their accustomed dole, Straggling among the beech-trees gleam no more With their red hoods in winter's wan sunshine. Why cometh not Sir Lancelot De Wace? Why cometh not that Knight? Full many a heart Among his vassal poor and menials grey With querulous expectation waits their lord. For the third Henry hath been crowned, and still Sir Lancelot De Wace is in the East. Why tarries that brave man so long from home? Now through the tenantry dismayed there goes A rumour that the good Sir Lancelot By Antioch in a lonely grove hath slain, And that not in the fair and equal lists, His youthful rival, who had wooed and won In fair betrothal that false-hearted maid, Ethilda, daughter of the old Sir Guy Of Heversham. It was a woful day When those ill tidings spread across the land, All up the wooded valley of the Kent, From the fair estuary with its cliffs Of natural causeway to the shallow mere Within the pastoral solitudes embraced,â With yellow flag-flowers and red willow-herb And dimpling globes of nuphar netted o'er, So that the splashing of the frighted coot, Or awkward-rising heron alone betrays The water underneath. There was one heart Throughout the length of his ancestral lands, A heart doubt-laden and yet sorrowful. That Athelstan in lawful duel slain Might be, they doubted not, nor blamed the deed; Only that aught unchivalrous was done By a De Wace's hand might not be thought. Sir Lancelot a murderer! Nay, the old, So credulous of ill, forthwith repelled The foul surmise. The headstrong faith of youth Would have done battle gladly for their lord In vindication of his honor. Ah! Both were by harsh and cruel proof convinced Of the dark tidings, when a retinue Of armÃ¨d men by royal warrant took In the king's name possession of the hall And the wide fief of Lancelot De Wace. Yet no one of injustice dreamed; no tongue Among the poor had ever word of ill To say of Hubert, the good minister,â Hubert de Burgh, who in disastrous times And the loose government of Henry's youth, The prey of worthless favorites, then controlled The rude, rough-handed baronage, by skill Of temperate policy, no less than arms, And a rare abstinence in victory. A man he was who in the general good Discerned still clearly, and with pious care Preserved inviolate, the silent rights Of individual happiness. Through him The weight wherewith an absent lord lies hard,â And specially that absent lord a king,â Upon his vassals, mitigation found In the green vale of Kent. Still it was hard For that ancestral peasantry to pay Unto a lord, to them unknown no less Than they, their sires, or local wants to him, The tribute of a base, reluctant toil In lieu of what they had been wont to bear,â The burden of affectionate service, paid With manly will, with manly thanks received, A mutual obligation more than right, By nine Sir Lancelots from sire to son. O'er the long glen of Sleddale evening hung With clouds of dreary grey; the heights were lost In the dull canopy, whose stooping folds Cast o'er the rock-strewn valley, uniform, A cold and purple shadow, while the sun To his invisible setting hasted down Without one thread of crimson to disclose How far the day was spent. With downcast eye, And scarcely noticing the gloomy scene, A wanderer, with a wayworn gait and air Of deep abstraction, climbed the mountain-side To Kentmere: it was Lancelot de Wace, Who sought, an Excommunicated Man, Among his native solitudes some lone And joyless hermitage, where he might bear Through what should yet remain to him of life, The weight of that dread censure, and the load, As burdensome, of drear, foreboding thought. A humbled and heart-stricken man he was, Who asked no mitigation of his lot, Nor would have welcomed it, if it had come Unsought; for, self-betrayed, before the throne Of Henry he had claimed his punishment, When he had been for seven whole years concealed A hermit or a wanderer in the east, In safety unendurable through sense Of guilt and gnawing of unquietness. For noble feats in Palestine achieved From capital penalties he was released, Only the forfeiture of his broad lands Was then confirmed; and the unbending Church With merciful severity had laid Her censures on him; lest his soul, through sin Too soon effaced, should perish in the end. Now from the ridge Sir Lancelot's stony way Dropped to the margin of the slimy mere, Fringed verdantly with dark and speckled weeds And water-plants profuse, whose shining leaves With bloody spots of brown were all bedropped; And tangled roots, like knotted snakes asleep, Half under water lay, and half above: And brittle stalks with veins of poisonous sap Exuded strongest odors; while the nights Of the beginning autumn inter-streaked The fenny herbage with its golden lines And pale, discolored red: the crisp white canes Of reedy sedge with plaint unmusical Grated against each other, as the wind Rung with shrill breathing o'er the waving swamp. The heron with discordant notice rose, And flapping wings, upon the cloudy air; Then, poised awhile, its plumaged rudder set This way or that, unto Winander's isles, Or woody pass below Glenridding Screes, Or promontory, seaward looking, far Towards Lune's or Leven's mouths. A single ring, Not native, of old willow trees there stood Round a deserted hut where dwelt erewhile A falconer, who in Sir Lancelot's youth Had hawked with him for many a happy hour By this same lake. The weary knight looked up Into the melancholy evening, spread O'er scenes once known so well, once loved so much; And for the first time with diverted thoughts Felt that there was additional bitterness, Even to a lot unbearable as his, In the localities around. O days Of our past boyhood, pregnant though ye were With giddy humours and debasing joys, What innocent appearance have ye, seen Through the long gloom of penitential thought In after years, by contrast falsified With guilt unequal made by age alone! O better far it were would memory O'erleap the pleasant worldliness of youth Which so entraps our thoughts, and rather muse On the few wrecks by radiant childhood left Upon the misty confines of our sense! O purest Time, from out the recent Font Still dewy, still with spiritual flowers Of musky scent and snowy tint adorned, How art thou to the hopeful, striving soul A bath of strength and innocent delights, With unfatigued recurrence visited! While to the pleasure-loving soul thou seem'st A tantalizing Eden, dimly seen To be delectable, yet not unbarred, But in mysterious thoughts absconded deep From restless wish, the memory of wild acts, Or sin-bleared eye. O there is gracious hope Of true amendment in the heart that seeks With sacred habit to revive the days Of its lost childhood, from its fragrant flowers To suck the honey of sad thought, or feed The wells of tears with dew-drops lurking still In earliest reminiscence unexhaled! Like silvery breakers on the lone sea-shore, The hoary foliage of the willows rose And fell in regular descents, and gleamed With dusky light upon the moorland dim. This then, so thought the weary fugitive, This is my welcome to my native home, The busy greeting of my vassals, this That arch of proud triumphal thought through which Hope and ambition entered once so oft In visionary pomp! This self-same day And self-same month, when to the hallowed East, With dreams untarnished yet, I journeyed first, I stood with Sigismund, the noble Pole, On our rude galley's deck. With silent speed Along the Servian shore we glided down The kingly Danube, where past Drenkova It bursts the green Carpathians through, and flows Betwixt impending cliffs and woods o'erarched Through sylvan horrors beautiful. The stream In eddies deep with glossy surface wheeled In calm solemnity. The leafy tops Of walnut woods, for centuries unfelled, With clematis and lithe wild vine were bound In their own thickets prisoners, while the crags Were hung with bells of white convolvulus, As though a bridal were to pass that way, A region of festoons, enwreathed for leagues One with another, while above the trees, Half masked, the cliffs of rich and mottled red In heavy brows or airy minarets Sprung emulous to catch the setting sun. Vale after vale with tributary stream We passed, and through their dusky wooded gates We caught sweet momentary views beyond. And one most touching spectacle there was, Still unforgotten; through an opening wide In the rough rampart of Danubian rocks, Far in the heart of Servia we beheld A mountain, like a couchant lion shaped, In softest purple clad, which for awhile Against the saffron sky stood boldly forth, But, as the furnace of the kindled west Glowed more intensely, was absorbed apace, Absorbed until incorporated wholly With shooting gold, which, crimson grown at length, Yielded once more from out its gorgeous womb The outline of the hill, distinct and keen. Oh in that hour what sunny thoughts were mine, What happiness, what hope exuberant! Ah! Sigismund, how enviable seems Thy fate, although no warrior's grave was thine; But by the sunbeams withered like a flower, Salem unreached, thy warfare was fulfilled, And in full armor, most ungentle shroud! Where paynim watch-fires nightly gleam, thou sleep'st; In the cold moonlight by these hands entombed Beneath a myrtle and an arbutus, By slow Orontes laved with stately lapse Near old Seleucia. O most dreary change! Most desolate! most dark! with hungry soul, Hungry of bitterness and penal woe, With honest acceptation do I bid Thee welcome! you, harsh wailing Winds, and Moors, And sobbing Mosses, and cold splashing Meres, And bleakest Mountains, by the noisy flail Of the rude tempest beaten, and white shares Of foamy torrents ploughed,âyou too I bid Welcome sincere, nay, grateful I may say, In hope the mercy of my God may work My punishment through you;âthrough, you perchance, Time, Solitude, long Fast, and Living rude, And Silence drear, may in His love exact Enough to satisfy His wrath: the rest, A greater heap, beyond all measure great, The Cross might pay, pay utterly, nor be Impoverished; so unsearchable its wealth. And from thy wealth, O Nature, gathering wealth, Wherewith perchance despondency may be Enriched to meekest hope; and venturous faith, By fear chastised, ennobled into love, I, a base sinner, shall not poorer be Than her who whilome in Sarepta dwelt A widow lone, and from thine outward forms A symbol, guided, chose. In her two sticks, To dress the unfailing sacrifice of meal And oil, a real sacrifice of faith No less than sustenance by God supplied, She chanced upon the saving Cross to light In type unlooked for; so mayhap can I, By lore my spirit hath already learned In distant Asia, find in natural forms Suggestive virtue which through grace may be In truth a poor auxiliary, yet still An aiding supplement to one who lies Beneath the ban of Holy Mother Church. Next into Troutbeck Vale, a savage scene Of matted coppice then, Sir Lancelot climbed. And lo! a welcome of white sunshine burst All on a sudden through the parting clouds. The mists cleared off from Kirkstone's rocky pass, And radiance, mounting from the glorious west In upward sloping beams, possessed the gorge With burning brightness, till it overflowed That ample pass into the lower vales. In falls of golden light it came, and rose Till the whole glen, with splendor flooded, seemed Full of ethereal beauty from the roots Of the wild mountains to their rugged heights. Sir Lancelot, whose pace uneasy thoughts Had lately quickened, now stood still and gazed, Then journeyed forward, weeping as he went In silence, inexpressibly relieved. Within the Vale of Troutbeck towards the head There is a single woody hill, enclosed Within the mountains, yet apart and low. Amid the underwood around, it seems Like a huge animal recumbent there, Not without grace; and sweetly apt it is To catch all wandering sunbeams as they pass, Or volatile lights in transit o'er the vale. And oft the travellers of this day may see The sunny hill within a flying shower Of greenest hue in that romantic glen. Upon the west there is a shaggy dell Marked with a dusky vein of alders grey, Beneath whose shade is heard a noisy brook Racing amid the stones; and eastward hangs A bell-shaped mountain which the wild winds ring Full mournfully, and by a verdant trench And stream that glimmers in a sunken fosse, Divided from the isolated hill. Both steep and smooth that grassy mountain is, Green as the noted turf upon Scale How, With junipers unspeckled, nor adorned With a loose surface of unquiet fern Which finds a wandering air upon the breast Of earth when pensive tree-tops sleep aloft, And with continual waving gives a light To the still prospects. But upon the brow Two regions of red heather are outspread In formal shapes, like plots of garden ground, Ending in lines so trim and straight no spade More straightly could have delved them, through dislike Of other soil, or the more rapid fall, Of the descent, or some more latent cause. That single hill it is, with hawthorn trees In parklike order scattered on the lawn, Which in the month of May, with muffled boughs Depressed by snow-drifts of chaste flower, might well Provoke the lambs to jealousy that flit In aimless frolic on the turf below, Like scudding foam across the dark green sea. And at the junction of the forkÃ¨d streams Where two wych-elms for ever dip their oars, And rise with starry drippings to the air, How wildly is the full moon's orbÃ¨d face Amid the shaken circles multiplied, And her attendant stars rebuffed from wave To wave, as though there had been war in heaven. The self-same hill it is, whereon the Knight Now sought an ancient hermitage, for years Vacant and ruinous, which in his youth In some long rambles he had visited. Beneath a grassy knoll, with coronal Of ragged ash surmounted, was the cell Between two leaning rocks, a desolate And uncouth residence, yet weather-proof, And from the running brook not far removed. Not for ablution only at the dawn, Or rite prelusive to more solemn prayer, Or with ingenious craft full often used At midnight to put back the approach of sleep, Aiding the spirit to subdue the flesh, Impatient of the vigil,ânot alone For all the baser ends of common life Was the propinquity of that clear stream A blessing: for a privilege it is To be a dweller in a sounding vale Of limpid waters from the mountainous rocks Descending, sweetly chanting as they come The praise of Baptism; so that when we walk Abroad, in each translucent deep we see The Font, and in the prattling shallows hear The missionary waters going forth From the pierced sides of those eternal heights To fill the cleansing vessels of the Church. O blessÃ¨d Element! how dread would seem The exulting rivers, and the buoyant plunge Of stony cataracts, unto the sons Of Sem, as witnessing the abiding power Of the destructive waters, yea, how dread The aspect of that fatal element, Even through the rainbow thoughts the Oath Divine Might haply furnish to their timorous hearts! But, O what ready consolation leaps, Like a reflected sunbeam, from the rills Into the Christian heart, while yet the drops Of our New Birth, not wholly dried within, Stir with a sweet response of hidden joy. So that when long upon a barren moor, Or breadth of arid pinewood, we have roamed, How cheerfully our weary footsteps make A needless circuit to attain a pool Discerned amid the heather or the stems, That we may look therein, and weep or smile As best befits the temper of the hour! And to my well-pleased ear each mountain brook With various plea, the chime of tumbling falls Or murmuring lapse, seems audibly to claim Kindred with Jordan, in whose typical wave All waters from the Body Virginal Of God's dear Son received the cleansing Gift, The Mystical Ablution of our sins Drawn from the contact of that Sacred Flesh. Stay, stay, poor worldly Hearts! and rest awhile From gainful traffic, and the frivolous war Of wordy senates, and the vulgar place In slanderous courts, all, talents in the earth Unprofitably hidden,ârest awhile, And with the poet o'er this woodland bridge Descend, or rather raise yourselves, to lean, And watch the fish in unpolluted depths Tarrying unmoved against the stream, old types, Haply by apostolic teaching first divulged, Of Him the Fish Divine through love submerged Within the depths of poor Humanity! Or with St. Leo, by some Latian stream In spirit walking, let us ponder well In every curve those still pellucid wombs Of crystal undefiled, where now converge The under-water beams which enter there, Piercing the fluent brook without a wound, And playing on the quiet stones beneath. Within such wombs are Christian babes conceived With an immaculate conception, pierced By the Invisible Spirit; for the power He gave to Mary hath He likewise shed Into these watery depths; what Jesus took From her, so speaks that ancient Saint, He laid Once more within the Sacramental Font. These are the wombs of Mary, these the depths Immaculate wherein the Fish resides. But see! the golden fisher from the bridge Shoots on his glancing wings; shall nature still Preach on? Lo! then, ye children of the world, That bird is crowned a king, and ever makes The streams the limits of his realm, the rills His pathway o'er the world, baptismal roads Which he deserteth never, and for food The venturous creature preys upon the fish, Like faith upon the Flesh of Him submerged For our behoof within those watery depths. Ah! had we kept that same baptismal path, The road of waters, we should not bewail With tearsâyet even those who weep are blestâ The ruffled splendor of our plumage now. Weep, weep, ye little mosses! ever weep With sunny trickling o'er yon giant rock! A power abides in your celestial tears Shed from the Rock Divine, more precious far Than that anointing which from Aron's beard Went down into the outskirts of the Law! Chime, all ye little Jordans! as I walk, Warning the penitent to keep the Gift Received; or, it were best to say, preserve What yet remains of that baptismal power! And while the mountains lift their mighty heads, Companions of the sunrise, and proclaim Christ, the true mountain, and the forests wave Their beckoning boughs and lisp in gentle songs, Heard by the meek in spirit, of Thy ways, O Holy Ghost! let this sweet valley preach Our Baptism, let the thunder of the floods Cry Baptism loudly to forgetful hearts, And let the summer-hidden brooks prolong The lesson in their accents soft and low, And murmur Baptism to the ear of love! O that the hermitage of all our lives, Our hidden lives secreted with our Lord, Might be, as was Sir Lancelot's rocky cell, Never from running brooks too far removed! In solemn mood of mind and with his thoughts Grave and collected, the lone Knight surveyed The sanctuary of cloudy years to come, The narrow vale and clasping bound of hills, The silent school-house of his solitude,â Where in the eye of nature he must learn The austere wisdom of repentance. There So long he stood, so ardently he gazed Upon the cell and its rough neighbourhood, Now in the twilight dusky and obscure, It seemed as though he waited for some sign, Or looked to find the features of the place Significant and legible, where he Some tokens of the future might detect: Till by the beauty of the night o'ercome, Looking upon the star-lit valley, thus, But silently within himself, he mused. Evening hath gone, hath died upon the hills, The vale, the river,âno one knoweth where; But her last lustrous breath hath passed at once From land and sky. The sombre earth is now But the grey, twilight-curtained bed, whereon That death is daily died. From every point Huge palls of black, continuous cloud are drawn Onward and upward till they meet above And rest upon the heights, roofing the earth With awful nearness,âlike the closing round, Audibly wafting, of seraphic wings To guard the slumbering world. With what a weight Night seems to lean incumbent on the earth, The earth still beating with the sun's late warmth! All things are hushed except the waterfalls, The inarticulate voices of the woods, And scarcely-silent shining of the moon. She how she hangs, the very soul of night, And from the purple hollow showers on man Her radiant pulses of unfruitful gold! O that I had the night-bird's wing to flee To many a dreadful glen and fishy tarn, Which I have seen and feared by day, (in youth Chasing the deer or anxious to reclaim A truant falcon) that at this still hour When night is working her chief miracles, And with grey shadowy lights is lying bare The very nerves of darkness, I might drink From the deep wells of terror one chaste draught To chill the over-lightness of my heart! Round me are hills whose summits seem to reel Within the unsteady atmosphere of night, Clothed in soft gloom, like raven's plumage: there Mid the strong folds of ether, and the zones Of mighty clasping winds that gird with chains The naked precipice and leaning peak, Great things and glorious pomps are going on Up in the birth-place of the storms and calms, Where light and darkness fetch their utmost powers To meet and clash in war unspeakable. And now and then throughout the quiet night Fragments of breezes with a liquid fall Drop to the lowlands, whisper in the reeds, And are drawn in beneath the silver brook, Bearing, it may be, messages and words Of wondrous import from the lines arrayed Upon the unseen steeps. But hark! the owls Shout from the firs on Wansfell, and the eye May trace those sailing pirates of the night, Stooping with dusky prows to cleave the gloom, Scattering a momentary wake behind, A palpable and broken brightness shed As with white wing they part the darksome air! Thus, inmate of the Ash-tree Hermitageâ Which they who seek will surely find, if so Imagination help them to the spotâ The lone Sir Lancelot dwelt for seven whole years And more. By his old vassals was he served With common necessaries duly left Twice in the week beneath a holly bush On a smooth slab of stone, a ministry Connived at by the merciful old man Who ruled St. Catherine's cloister by the lake, If not suggested by his thoughtful love. Yet speech did no one hold with their poor lord; On such condition was it understood Connivance rested; yet from brake or hill Full many an eye, both young and old, would watch To see the last De Wace, as by his cell He stood, or from the tangled copse emerged High up to wander on the open moors. It chanced that in the byegone years his lot A strange, mysterious Providence had met In Caucasus and by the savage steppes Interminable, and the Asian lakes, Whereby the powers of nature had been made To him a language dimly understood,â A punishment, yet not without relief Commingled, science far above the pitch Of those rough days, except unto the few To whom the stars obediently would yield Nightly interpretations, and the stones Their latent mutabilities unfold, And gums and fatal saps would minister Their properties medicinal, for ends Unhallowed, and a loathsome skill. Even such, Only more guilty, is the fearful use Of nature made in these self-boasting days, By science unabashed before the Eye Of the Supreme, and not on bended knees Its searches prosecuting day and night. A base, idolatrous ritual it is, Whence, in oblivion oft of the First Cause, Self-swollen knowledge uncouth service yields To second causes multitudinous;â Not in the beautiful and bright array Of mystic truths, impersonations fair Of sight or sound, which in old Greece were wont To minister unto the inward sense Of what Eternal was and Infinite, And ofttimes raised the soul above herself,â Faith even in its short-comings beautiful;â But with a barren worship of poor names, Vacant, unhelpful, unimpassioned; loud In novelty of dissonance,âoh! how Unlike the symphony true science wakes, In sympathy absorbing to itself The skilful tones of sweet Theology, Which Heaven hath crowned the queen of sciences, Mother of truth and fountain of the arts, Pure heavenly lore, within the humble soul, In varying tune with every want and woe And every homeless love of humankind,â A deep accord of everlasting praise Preluded now, with such rehearsal as Might win the world unto the side of Heaven, If to the charming she would lend an ear. Like some insidious creature, self-immured, Which 'neath the glebe absconds, and hourly fights Against the outward beauty of the earth With dull corrosive diligence, so lurks The curse of Babel at the secret root Of popular language or the invented tongue Of mundane science, and, each passing year, Sunders with more effectual divorce The mighty power of language from the Faith, Which once with amity subserved the truth In Creeds consigned, through spiritual power At Pentecost infused into the Church, From Tongues of Fire distilled, unquenchable As is the beacon by the climbing surge. O I could weep for that most grievous wrong Which we commit, the trespass of our lips, Against the noble majesty of day, And sacred beauty of nocturnal skies! When o'er the weary realms of Europe, God, Upon the purple walls of midnight, deigns To write the sweet inscriptions of His love In starry characters, lo! science lifts Her forehead unabashed, and from her towers Preaches the pagan worship, rites and spells, Junctions and separations, there fulfilled By red-haired Mars, or that divinest orb, Beaming on children at their early prayers, The lamp of evening now surnamed from her The sea-born goddess. And upon the earth, In patient loveliness outspread, no less Prevails the tyranny of pagan names, Bidding that eloquent preacher hold her peace; Drawing across her blazonry of types A veil of denser woof than that of old, Broidered with form of every living thing, In Egypt woven for the Isiac rites. Flowers that for innate love of Jesus sign Their little bosoms with a summer Cross, Choice blooms through simple mention consecrate By the dear Saviour's Lips, and modest herbs Which in their form or habits could remind Past ages of the Blissful Mother, torn Each from its little pulpit, sing by force, Hard by the waters of our Babylon, Of Venus, or the self-admiring boy, Or wounded gallant whom the goddess loved. Ah me! we need another Pentecost Unto the stammering nations to restore Their unity of ritual voice again! That deed of ill by humble men deplored Which boastfully deformed the catholic past, And now hath shaped three centuries to bear Its paltry and disfigured lineaments, Hath more than half way travelled toward a change. Therefore, as admonition to ourselves And grave enticement to our friends, let us, Each in his unobtrusive measure, turn The helm of our swift-sailing words, and steer Our common converse by more Christian stars; Mindful that on the new-created earth The first, sublimest litany that rose, From man unto the Triune God above, Was that miraculous Nomenclature given With mystical intelligence to all Created things by Adam, thus inspired To worship God with that primeval song,â A litany the sweetest which the earth Had rendered, till the Church was taught to sing The dear life-giving Dolours of her Lord! But, not like alchemist or vigil-worn Astrologer, Sir Lancelot entertained Communion far sublimer than was wont, But of a moral sort, with natural things; Striving in true submission to the Church To bear her weight, yet not the less to seek From earth consoling wisdom like her own,â A rule whereby to mete his inward growth, A melody to which he might attune The variable temper of his soul: As though some roots and remnants there might be, Inverted strata of the treasure once In earth laid up, when mystic tillage could Suffice for discipline to sinless man, By God ordained in Paradise of old,â Through the fierce action of the ancient curse Delved deep into the soil, but by the power Of Christian meditation haply still Recoverable, and which may yet escape In obscure spots and by unthought-of ways The jealous custody wherein it lies. How much had been retrieved in elder times And through the affectionate patience of the Church, In Alexandria chiefly, had the Knight Been duly taught when in Bologna once He studied, and a far-famed doctor there, While the vast hall was througed with auditors, In studious exposition had unlocked The cabinets of Christian allegory. And such communion did he now attempt To achieve in that his penal hermitage. BOOK II. THE BOOKS. There to his solitude the seasons came, And each one took him gently by surprise, Turning on noiseless hinges unperceived. Spring calmly passed, like some transparent dream, Upon the spirit of the wintry earth, And then was in the shady summer lost, Ere he was conscious of a growing change: And though more palpably, yet autumn stole With subtle step encroaching on the depths Of summer foliage. And in nothing else Is nature's sacred influence more confessed A healing balsam, than in that calm use Of present hours and opportunities Which her unfretful transmutations breed, And soft, deliberate beauty. Then perchance Each season wore a trace within his heart, Furthered his discipline, and left his soul In some advance upon the season past. Though the gross eye when introverted most Must be content to measure inward growths Attained, which in their act of growing shunned The contemplative gaze. For seven long years Earth's four magnificent mutations rolled Above him and around him, while within His spirit yielded with responsive change. He loved spring's downy green and brilliant veins Of vivid fern that striped the sloping hills, And the white splendors of her sunshine showers, When birds beneath the rainbow arches sang With lusty music, and the wild flowers rose Almost beneath his footsteps as he walked. And with a pensive humor would he watch How summer's green grew darker in the rains Which swept assiduously upon the hills, Or hung in laboring folds of fleecy mist Which shed their tear-drops imperceptibly, And with the sunbeam wild enchantments wrought, Or ministered nocturnal pageantry Unto the silver moon. Autumnal days He noted for their variable lights, Stirring or still, on those discolored moors Of green sward slowly withering into white, Hollows of tawny fern or purple heath, And blue stones from the trickling mosses wet Gleaming like polished marble on the steeps, And through an atmosphere beheld, so soft, The mountains seemed like cushions that would yield Elastic to the pressure of the arm Of one reclining. In the bright cold eye And dazzling aspect of the wintry sun, Which from the low horizon slanting looks Into the face, not on the heights of heaven As in the deep and fervent midsummer Commodiously enthroned, he loved to mark The threads of moss which shot across the slopes, Yellow and scarlet and refulgent green, All round the springs in bulging pillows swollen; And night was never half so beautiful As on the hills in frosty starlight spread Snow-capped, and with a hundred echoes filled Waked by the clear-voiced raving of the brooks. In that pacific splendor of the stars On wintry nights, with what a fair deceit Is undue summer born afresh, to one Who wanders half-way up some wooded hill! The beeches, whose dry clinging leaves by day Seem like the rustling shroud upon a ghost, In the vague light now swell upon the eye In dusky size, and outline unconfirmed Of nodding umbrage, while the vale below Trembles beneath a half translucent sea, That with alternate waves of light and dark Clothes the grey marshy fallows at our feet With dim magnificence, as Christian thought Sheds on the beaten path of common tasks The aspect of infinity, by right To duties appertaining, as to powers Which, howsoever mean or common-place, Enclose some portion of the Will of God. Nor wanted he another simple joy Bestowed in that drear sabbath of the earth; For wandering near the wintry streams, kept low By frosts that seal the upland springs, he loved The glistening star which on the ouzle's breast Twinkles upon the ice-rimmed stones, or flits Shooting its snowy beam all up the rill, Winding as it may wind, and not a curve Evading, nor a cape of meadow-land In lawless transit crossing, like some orb That wheels obedient on a tortuous path Upon the trackless sky. A visitant, That living Luminary ne'er arrives Till with the cold of our declining year: Andânot inapt to watchful hearts will seem The bold comparisonâit bodies forth To pious thought the Migratory Star Of Christmas, which the swarthy Magians led To Him new-born among the flocks and herds. The lesser revolutions of the day, And silent-footed night, were meted out By him with ritual observances, And an affectionate formality. The sun, now burning in the azure heaven, Now urging on his white and spectral disk Perceptibly behind a veil of clouds, Was his sole altar-lamp, a Voice of Lightâ So may an inmate of a mountain home Not over-boldly name the sunâa Voice, Which from the pearly east invoked him first To rise, and, when with risen orb it stood Above the hills, it summoned him to prime; And when the vale was filled with light, it rang With its descending beams the hour of tierce; Or when it sparkled in the central sky (Not least a Voice at that deep earth-stilled hour) Bespoke the noon-day service, and, half-way Sloped westward, then a fresh monition gave, Ere yet the sunset waked his vesper thoughts; And, the moist twilight of the compline passed, The moon three times in her ascent proclaimed, Stooping from out her balcony serene, Three several nocturns, and the dubious light Of dawn, whose sweet confusion mingles half Night's softness with day's clear transparent hue, Seemed interposed for lauds, that at the prayer Of His true Church the Bridegroom might unveil His spiritual sunrise to the soul. Thus were his hours partitioned, and no less Had he invented rituals minute, Which with the fluctuations harmonized Of our unsteady climate: patterns sweet He found, and drew from his remembrances Of catholic observance, and the forms Divine of Rome's magnificent liturgies. And gradually mounting in degree As observation monthly added fresh Intelligence, he to a strange extent Evoked the spirit of earth's ritual, The natural liturgies of storm and calm, And swelling symphonies of choral winds With solitary breezes blending faintly; While in the stately gestures of the clouds He studied her processional. Yet poor And feeble was the approach which he could make Toward shadowing out a service for himself From earth's disjointed symbols. Still from these, And from his punishment endured with awe, And from the grace of Christ which runneth over Even on the outcast and the separate, And from the weekly mass, heard in the porch Of grey St. Catherine's by the lonely lake, And ritual joys upon occasional feasts In secret snatched, and only half enjoyed As aids to penance, rather than reliefs,â He gathered wherewithal to train his soul Through penitential gloom to filial love: And angels ministered without disdain Unto that Excommunicated Man. And other aids he had of no mean sort, But mighty in accomplishing his end. For not a soul inhabits the wide earth, Inside the Church or out, which is not reached By some stray blessing and uncertain grace Irregular, and oft miraculous As oft dispensing with appointed forms: So all untiring is the love of God, So all unsearchable the grace of Christ. Two Books he had brought with him to the hills By happy chance, for not more suitable Could they have been, or to his present lot More curiously appropriate, if he With choice long-pondered had selected them: Aids might they be and complements, perchance, Which could supply unto his mind what lacked Of self-interpretation in the earth, To comment on her own fair mysteries With illustrations of a moral kind. Keys were they, aptly fitted to unlock Her inspiration of sustaining thought, Her subsidies of spiritual strength, And consolations, with sublimity No less than a relieving gentleness Adapted to the variable walks And destinies of fallen humanity. One was a fragment of the Written Word, By God consigned unto the Holy Church, Her charter, whence with her vast mind informed With apostolic saying, by the cloud, That luminous pillar of our wilderness, Of old tradition throughout her descents Not without miracle accompanied, She was to teach the hearts of Christian men; Sole teacher she, and that one Book the chief Original fountain of her teaching! There, In mute magnificent procession led, We see the fortunes of Humanity, The various discipline of Adam's race; And from our childhood upward learn to weep Or smile in cherished sympathy with him In Bethel dreaming, or with Joseph sold To foreign merchants, and with bursting heart Weeping impassionedly upon the neck Of Rachel's youngest-born. There man is seen In fluctuations marvellous and wild, And yet by revelation ascertained Infallible, drawn forward to the Cross, The everlasting haven of our kind. There with that solitary, blameless man Beginning, tenant of God's Paradise, Now fallen we behold our nature led Through dreams and expiations shadowy In blood of beasts approached, through old Traditions of hereditary forms Of service primitive, and colloquies With angel apparitions, and a law Of onerous significance imposed On private life and on the social state, In its pure self a blessing, to a curse By sin commuted unendurable, Through prophecy translated more and more, And goaded by a harsh captivity, Into the dawning of Messiah's Day. And then upon the threshold of two worlds In the drear wilderness the Baptist stood, And with authentic voice proclaimed aloud The ceremonial education over, And that the beautiful and solemn Day Had absolutely broken in the East. And thenâO Wisdom graciously vouchsafed, To be by us affectionately prized And by the Church assiduously taught!â The eye beholds how, for a few short years Divine Exemplar, dwelt upon the earth Goodness and Truth, the Eternal Plenitude Of the true Godhead bodily comprised In Flesh the blissful Mary minister'd, Two Natures deeply intercommuning With a mysterious intimacy, joined In unity of Person all Divine,â And how at length, our sole Atonement made In His health-giving Passion, He went up To Glory He had never left, to sit, Yet not divorced from Flesh so late assumed, Man, worshipped by the hierarchies of heaven. Then far across the universal earth, Through God's election secretly exhaled, By sacramental links in unity Compact, the Mystic Body grew apace, On twelve foundation stones reposing sure; Which through supernal pilotage hath steered Right o'er opposing ages westward bound, And still shall steer, transfigured evermore With varying splendors suitably ordained Unto the age and sickness of the world, Whether in her magnific decadence, Or fresh returns towards her primal strenght. O Book most good! most holy! on our knees To be full often scanned, how blest was he, That lonely, Excommunicated Man, That one small portion of thy heavenly lore At least was his, whence fervors unreproved Were fed, and terror deepened and chaste love, Love far beyond a sinner's worth or hope, Begotten of calm prayer within his soul, And thanksgivings which hardly dared to be Thanksgivings, as above his guilty state! A little parchment Manuscript it was, Laboriously written, and emblazed With uncial letters fancifully streaked In flourishes of vermeil and of gold, A task of love by some most diligent monk In cloistered leisure reverently adorned. And therein was contained the Book of Job, In the quaint style and sinewy rhythm composed, And touching diction of the barbarous And powerful Latin of the western Church, Rich in a strange felicity to print Expressions picturesquely turned, and thoughts Through bold ellipses darkly signified, Upon the memory, by that darkness wooed To deep attention. And there could not be Of Holy Writ a portion suited more Unto the aspirations of his soul And wholesome sadness than that Book of Job. In the far east long centuries ago Of which we have no count, amid the tents Of Hus, and pastoral magnificence Of its great men, a marvellous Voice was heard,â Anguish, submission, patience, all conjoined With solemn vindications, and expressed In interrogatories boldly urged, Yet with a reverent spirit, to the Judge Supreme in Heaven and Maker of mankind. The Voice it was of lorn Humanity Turning abrupt, like oxen on the goads, On its intolerable destiny, Its woes intense and hungry sympathies Unsatisfied, and craving hopes and loves, And bodily torments vile, all unsustained By dignity in the endurance. There, In Hus, Humanity thus turned abrupt, As though refusing further to advance, With thoughtful obstinacy, not unpraised Of God, by purblind men not understood. And now no more by destiny pursued, A flying victim in ignoble rout, It turned to face the curse, and wise in faith Questioned the lofty quarter whence it came; Not in the tame philosophy content With explanations timidly beneath God's glory, offered by the poverty Of common consolation, and the world's Unspiritual humility of speech,â An unregarded offering. It was bold In lofty thought, and in its questionings Not ignorant. O surely not without Divine suggestion of the nobleness Of its original nature, and the sense Of supernatural alliance fed Within the spirit by deep communings With worlds invisible, and obvious prints Of an Almighty Presence on the earth. Never was music heard among mankind Like that most fluctuating Voice! Wild strains, Beating in awful cadence like the surge Which marks the rough pulsations of the storm, Making the solid shore to groan, or like The cry of angry torture oft dispersed By wounded eagles in the echoing vales Of the hushed mountains. Wild and lofty strains Were they of venturous passion now, and now Of self-abasement dignified, which rose And fell,âwith troublous warbling of loose notes Rose thrillingly, and with a prelude strange Of shaken keys disorderly, and fell With steady sound and pressure masculine, Like a loud march in music, or the close Of some full-hearted requiem. One while Most querulous, yet not unsweetly so, It sued for rest in death, and then accused The blessed functions of the fruitful womb, Declaring life unprized, and preaching how The moist clods of the valley should be sweet Unto the weary limbs and world-worn heart. With better sense of its own majesty And possibilities of Heaven, It then Complained of the Almighty's mystic love Of darkness and concealment in His ways; Till by the very greatness of its thoughts Rebuked, its vileness did It straight confess With ample self-disparagement. It brooked The Voice of God, but in forbearance meek Once, twice It spake, the third time answered not, But laid its hand, a signet on its mouth; In lamentation skilful, not in proof, When God, a sixth in that great colloquy, Vouchsafed to interpose. It could not brook,â That plaintive Voice of our Humanity, It could not brook the Vision of our God, (Although it quailed not at His gracious Voice) But speechless was, abhorrent of itself. How changed the converse since the Almighty talked In the cool time of Asiatic day, Beneath the umbrage of the happy groves Where Adam dwelt, our ancestor revered, Whose solemn memory we may cherish still And, silent, wrap it in our tenderest thoughts! The blazoned Manuscript a spirit was, Instinct with grandeur, to that lonely Man; And his whole temper consciously was raised With an uplifting of his thoughts, while he, Listening the pathos of that awful Voice From out the depths of poor Humanity, Gazed like a seer upon the thrilling scene Where Everlasting Mercy justified The Voice which, unalarmed, maintained its ways. Nor wanted he a fountain whence to draw Improving sadness, and no less beguile The melancholy leisure of his time. A Book it was, in true ascetic tone Composed, the labor of the austere pen Of old Hieronymus, which from a monk Of Brescia in his youth he had received, A student in Bologna's grim arcades. Through years of pleasure, love, and idle joust, And in far darker scenes of wilful sin, With a contemptuous care he had preserved The gift, at first with courteous sneer received; While his companions rang a giddy change Of gibes upon the monk who so misplaced In sinful hands his pious offering. But thus not seldom is the eye of age By Heaven illuminated to discern Upon the lineaments of youth some trace Of character behind the character Of our first years, hereafter to absorb Our lives with unexpected mastery: And thus it speaks and warns in words that seem To indicate a most misjudging eye, Till time avenges it upon the harsh And forward condemnations of our youth. For now the Penitent in that old Book A power encountered both to heal and bless, An angel guest most gladly entertained. Three scant biographies the Book comprised, Which did to him abound; for thence he drew An application ever fresh, because In some sort mated to his changeful moods. One while amid the parched Thebaid sands With that first eremite, the holy Paul, He conversed to the profit of his soul. And specially at even-tide he stood, Translated in his spirit, at the cave Now in Egyptian sand-drifts all engulfed. Embayed within a horrid cliff it was, Where the scorched mountains confine on the sand, A lonely, miserable place, yet not Without some insulated loveliness. It was most sweetly roofed with bluest sky Stopping the chinks of a suspended palm, Which overhead hung like a green alcove, And ever found a feebly suing breeze, Even from the sands, in whose weak breath it was Floating and stationary both at once. Amid its roots a lucid fountain sprung With copious jet, and with a tinkling sound Which seemed to augment the coolness of the place. And, touching marvel! by the selfsame vent, Through which the little silver column rose, Was it continually absorbed again. A habitation was it once where dwelt Unlawful coiners, and in it pursued Their trade, what time voluptuous Antony With Cleopatra dallied by the Nile As though Rome was not, and their implements Lay scattered in the corners of the rock. There Paul the Hermit dwelt, in amity And mutual understanding marvellous With the rough beasts; there on his knees he died: A lion dug his grave, while Antony, That choice ascetic, wrapped his sacred corpse In his own treasured cloak, the humble gift Of Athanasius, pillar of the faith. For miracles, upon the outer world Effected, are but shadows from within Of those mysterious heights of power, attained Through the unseen miracles of faith and love, And long afflictive penance in the soul. In like communion with the inferior tribes St. Francis lived, who, on Alvernia rapt, At the Seven Hours was duly called to prayer By a mysterious falcon on the hills, The wandering creature self-constrained through love, With no reluctant office, to supply The holy purpose of a convent bell. And there the poet of our latest times, Poet and sage, and with lay-priesthood clothed To wind the prelude on the magic horn Of ancient truth, behind the cuckoo's cry Discerned, and with obedient ear received, The Baptist's call to deeper penitence,â A pilgrim in the Tuscan Apennines, Met by the admonitions of the Faith Within that vernal liturgy consigned. Thus was the Penitent full oft with Paul And the wild beasts in conclave most uncouth. Or in the noisy midnights went his thoughts (A second history prompting now his mind) With young Hilarion on the rough sea-shore Of Palestine, with robbers prowling round, Or sick from Gaza journeying to be healed. Again in other moods his Book would lead His rapt imagination far away To eastern noontide, and the drowsy plains, Where brittle salt-herbs struggle with wild thyme, And Malchus, captive monk, who pastured there The sheepflocks of the ungodly Saracens. Then humble Joy, the heavenly exile, came In various guise to that most lonely cell. For, wandering like a pilgrim o'er the world, She visits all and sojourneth with none; For either churlish sin will bar her out, Or peevish and inhospitable mirth Will seek a quarrel with her, brooking not The admonition of her quiet ways. And yet, methinks, it were a thought more true, That Joy, which knocks so often at our doors, No prompt departure takes, but lingering still, Like an importunate benefactor, stays To wait a kindlier mood; and at our feet She lies, when we go forth, as one that asks An alms; and in the heyday of our dreams, And chiefly in our foolish youth, we spurn The Angel with as little thought, or even With something of the whim wherewith we spurn, With more intention than we need, the leaves Of yellow autumn; and then sadness comes, Slackening the current of our dreams, and does Her pleasant office, bending to the ground Our lofty spirits, till our eyes find out Her whom we thought far off, whose modest place And most unlikely fashion staring hope Had overlooked. Alas! we live too fast And look too forward to be joyful men. We get and gain too much. Our faith in Christ Is written in our holy books, a thing Of bliss which we can never make of it, Or will not make of it, although we can. And when we would constrain our worldly hearts To attitude of joy, we but presume, Or vex our lips to utter formal words Which have no inward echo: for to joy In Jesus is a spiritual gift, A simple, childlike power, that sings its songs Leaning upon obedience strict and calm, And nurtured at the breast of sacred fear. Of all the rituals to which humble Joy Consigned herself for that most lonely Man, Let one be named. When autumn's wailing winds, Or silent action of November's frost, With tawny acorns strewed the leafy ground, There passed a pleasant change upon the place, A sweet invasion of the solitude. A tide of little children daily flowed Up the deserted valley, and outspread, Single or in associate bands, all day To glean the woodland fruitage, and at eve Softly receded to their distant homes As though the sunset ruled their silent ebb. In the first year Sir Lancelot had endured This brief intrusion with unquiet mind. And then his shyness bore it, as he brooked The rustic eyes that looked on him at mass, And with an awkward delicacy strove To look as though they did not mean to look. But afterward did it become a change, A little revolution in the vale, Which expectation looked for, and, when come, Enjoyed without reluctance; for it brought An influx of sweet images, and trains Of profitable pleasure, which it seemed An ill-directed penance to avoid. The merry voices cast into the woods, Ubiquitous, like cuckoo's muffled cries, The encounter with blythe faces, and the awe, Endeavouring to look bold, with which they made Frightened obeisance, and the cheerful sound Of many footsteps tripping o'er the leaves, The diligent ambition, often foiled, To drag their heavy sack of acorns home, Loaded beyond their strength, the unselfish aid By sisters to their little brothers given, Themselves by elder brothers all unhelped Such images, that for a single week Peopled the valley, yielded harmless store Of grateful meditation, blythe or sad, Abetted by the silence that ensued, Itself incomparably deepened there By those bright presences, which left it now A melancholy breadth of shore whereon An hour ago the sparkling waters were. And let it not a trifling help be deemed, A subsidy which conscience would disdain, That, when the soft and steady south wind blew On holy days, it wafted to his ear From the old priory by the neighbouring lake The pleasant admonitions of the bells. Few hearts there are so hard that they can hear That soothing sound unmoved, so sweet it is, And in the spirit of old childhood steeped, A very plaintive haunting, pregnant all With memories of our lost maternal love, And the first innocent delights of home. O while association, of pure thoughts Begotten and chaste memories, hath the power To purify and heighten, let it not With poor disdainful wantonness forswear Its old and true alliance with church-bells! There sometimes did the Penitent steal down, Ere the green mountains in the sunrise blushed, Unto St. Catherine's chapel by the mere; Half doubting, whether it were well his soul Should feed upon sweet sounds, and drink the cup Of exquisite church-music, to allay For one short hour the weary strife within. And through the underwood obscure he crept Inside a curtain of dark elder boughs, Shading the buttresses upon the north: And there with many a tear, and yet a joy Amid his tears, he heard the chanted Mass Sound feebly through the old and solid wall. And often in the summer did he catch, Through open windows tremulously borne, A breath of incense; and, returned once more To his lone hermitage, that odor hung Around his temper like an atmosphere Of blessing, sometimes undispersed for days. To this and other holdfasts, that may seem But trivial unto us who are so rich In our neglected means, his spirit clung, And by them climbed, and from them knew to draw Apt nourishment. Two Portals dread there are, Whereby a thousand, thousand catholic souls, On their invisible occupations bound, Are passing and repassing in and out The spiritual world the whole day through. Chief from the blessÃ¨d Incarnation hewn, With Blood and Water tempered, is the Gate Of Sacramental Access to the Throne, Unseen but not far off, of God Supreme. Then, mighty though subordinate, the Gate Of Prayer, or rather Gateway without gate, Open, unsentinelled by day or night. Thence to and fro, from earth to Heaven, and back From Heaven to earth, the living spirits range Through regions infinite, and see great sights, And come across calm foretastes of the bliss To be hereafter. From the first of these Sir Lancelot was for a while repulsed For his soul's health at last; but through the Gate So mercifully left without a guard, With the devotion of pure thought, and rite Of actual prayer, his spirit hourly passed. Yet I would fain believe, if so the thought Acceptance find with wisdom more assured Than mine, that, in the daily pomps and shows Of nature, there are posterns ill discerned, Through negligence long overgrown with weeds, Or in the effulgence of the present Church O'ershadowed, and by which a guided soul, Through sweet discoveries led, may entrance gain Into the world of spirit that confines So closely on our own, and meet with God Not wholly from our Eden yet withdrawn, Or through the reconciling Cross content His hidden Presence once more to renew Elsewhere than in the grave disclosures made By Holy Church in Mysteries Divine, Yet there, there only, surely manifest. In some deep ways and through a patient love, Unseated often from his anxious heart Through the distress of penitential fears, The Excommunicated found a church In natural things, that, shapeless as it was, Largely enriched his poverty of means. Even time, unaided in its silent lapse, Not wholly powerless hath been found to heal, To elevate, and to sustain: much more May nature, with her simple earthly shows, And her betrayings of unearthly powers, Claim for herself a gift medicinal. Some have there been of old, some may be now, Who have devoutly faced earth's mysteries, (Often most solemnly when least supposed) Not with the pomp of knowledge, but the approach Of reverent longing, and have gently worn By the soft pressure of assiduous love A pathway through the colored veil of things. Sir Lancelot was changed. Earth not in vain Had wooed his heart, which somewhat lighter grew Without aught being diminished of the sense Of miserable guilt and fearful stain. Sin seemed a stranger thing, and it was cast To a far greater distance in his thoughts Than heretofore, and virtue lovelier seemed, And purity more welcome to his heart. For slowly his repentance had outgrown The broader shadows of remorse, and grace In meek anticipations was perceived A growing light amid his darker thoughts. And joy once more unto his spirit came In fitful visitations, like the wind In measured pauses on a summer's day. And beautiful as all things were around, Most beautiful, because contributing Most freshness and relief, was natural change. How sweet is change! In sickness or in grief The very alternations of our pain Are recognized for ease: and happiness Is fed by fluctuations in its kind; And love that would be trustful must have change To overtake the mutability Of temper in its object, else the heart O'ertops the languid passion with its growths. And when is change more blameless or more soft Than in the transformations of the earth And sky? Thus after weeks of sunny days With mind well-pleased Sir Lancelot would behold Tenacious mists receive unto themselves The green hill-tops and promontoried steeps For other weeks of rain to be involved In the cool chambers of the humid clouds. Thence would they issue forth once more, bright cones Of kindled herbage or of glittering rock, Which from a region of perpetual gleams With sunny aspect overlooked the vales. And, thus emerging from the folds of mist With freshened tints and store of tinkling springs, Which fall in trills of bell-like sound from rock To rock all down, the mountain heights appeared New features in the scene, by novelty Clothed in fresh interest, and with envy too Of their so long communion up on high With the dark spirit of the mighty mists. And not less grateful to his mind, the more That it by melancholy thought was so Enhanced, was the sad change of faded earth When summer days were shortening. The gay flush Of the first evenings of the genial spring Was not more acceptable to his heart, Than chill elastic airs which nimbly breathe O'er the white rime of an autumnal morn. There was a quickening in them both which gave An impulse to his soul, an industry Of thought which could on simple joys bestow Authentic patent of nobility. BOOK III. THE BEAUTIFUL YEAR. With what soft airs and visionary change, Sweetly protracted, doth our English spring, Welcome invader, march by running stream Or woodland skirt, and capture sunny bank And sheltered nook, and with a kind surprise Hang his green-spotted banner in one day Upon a score of tree-tops, whence he flings, As from his strongholds over hill and dale, Long leafy chains until the land is his By conquest visible, and obvious right Which the pleased eye accords. More sweet by far This wayward tardiness, this gentle strife Twixt day and night, crisp rime and genial sun, Than spring's approach of strangely mingled speed And tedious slowness, such as we behold On Lombard plain or Bergamascan slopes Facing the warm winds of the south, where dykes, With herbage newly flushed, glow all at once With violets both blue and white, and tufts Of primrose, and the periwinkle, thick As garlands twisted for a May-day show. Downward they nod into a thousand streams Or threads of trickling silver, that enrich The oozy rice-grounds, or with upward eye, Their beauty pleading for the season, woo The unwilling leaves from out the mulberry buds Week after week in vain. More sweet by far Our spring, retarded thus delightfully, Than the wild burst which over Provence hangs, As if by necromantic touch exhaled, A tremulous earth-born cloud of almond-bloom, Pale blush with pearly white ingrained, to mock The olive-yards. More sweet by far than when One sunrise over the Trinacrian fields, From Monte Baido to the sea that chafes The spurs of Etna, flings a gleamy web With instantaneous blossoms all outrolled Of tasselled cactus, woven visibly Before the traveller's eye as on his mule He goes, with wizard spring outriding him. Dear Isle of England, where the seasons meet And part with such a kindly intercourse Of change, the weeping brightness of whose sun Is tempered so with alterations bland Of inland breezes and salubrious airs, Which the clouds waft from our circumfluent sea, Inspiring wandering breaths in summer noon, And slackening winter's hold upon the earth,â How fortunately fixed are thy sweet shores Fronting the warm Atlantic! Neither heat Nor cold, in mutable excesses each When present felt least tolerable, reign O'er thy free landscapes with tyrannic sway, True vassals here, not lords, where hill and dale With a kind birthright of locality Are free as those who till the genial soil, More truly free, for not like them enslaved Unto the boast of liberty. Not here In desolating plague of sickly winds, In blistering mildew or volcano's wrath, In vernal rivers swollen to a curse, Or the fierce grandeurs of the avalanche, In flood or earthquake, are deep nature's powers In ruinous magnificence displayed: But o'er the modest scenery, secure In lowly features, temperate beauty reigns, By the four seasons checquered, not disturbed. O pleasant country! Father-land revered! Thee and thy clime must I perforce extol, Fit cause perceiving, fit for me who am From morn till eve a dweller out of doors, Not seldom later far than eve, content Now with the neat parterre and laurel walk, Confinement to some moods adapted most,â Or breezy deck of elevated lawn Which overlooks the vale, and throws the eye Alternately upon the southern lake Or mountain cove with mist or sunlight filled, Purple or green with streaks of ruddy soil; And, when loose humors will it so, I seek With aspiration restless and unfixed A range unlimited among the hills, Or woody fringes of the distant meres: In winter unconfined by cold, nor burnt With more than welcome heat on summer days, And often with a twilight of soft clouds, Which most persuasively solicits thought. And now, unlearning my past mountain life, With thoughts like anchored things, I walk or sit Beneath three gables of time-fretted stone, Watching the huge mimosa's half-clothed boughs Tracing light-fingered shadows on the house; Or through the pointed arch of chestnut leaves, The boasted work of sylvan architect, Tearfully gazing on the far church-tower, And pondering deep responsibilities, akin To austere contemplation, not to song. O when the snowdrop gems the bright brown earth Of merry England, and the tender thrush Salutes the sunset from the budding spray, And, pleased with his own aptness, practises Into the night his last year's melody,â Then may the poet, alway vigilant In such deep yearning love of humankind As will not grieve or joy alone, detect For the outpouring of kind sympathies A vent in meditation on the lot Of the plain pastoral men who in the vales Of the fair Tyrol dwell. Ah! I have seen, When the warm breath of deepest summer glowed On the green slopes, earth's lineaments deformed By frowns of vernal anger uneffaced, Marring soft landscapes, like a troubled look In eyes where love alone hath lawful right To shine: the meadow-fields with stones besprent, The paths fierce waters for themselves have hewn Through woody steeps, the broad and staring seam Of gravel down the centre of the vales, The trunks of alder huddled on the banks In wreek unsightly! Beautiful, and calm, And darkened with sweet mantling shades, as are Those glens of Tyrol in the summer-tide, Who hath the heart to realize the mass Of dead white snow, the chalets half engulphed, The stallÃ¨d kine, the voiceless streams, the hush Of Alpine winter terrible, a hush Broken, most surely not relieved, by winds And wolves alternately? There Adam's sons Fight with the snow-drift and the elements Unmerciful and mighty to invade Our first prerogative; while Adam's curse, Like an enchanted loom, incessantly Plies round the herdsman there, yet masters not Inventive toil and patient manliness. O sweet are then responsibilities Enjoining fortitude through simple love Of wife and child, when the vexed peasant finds In obligations lofty and divine A tranquil haven, and an anchorage Of chaste enjoyment, of impassioned peace, And moral elevation, and a trust Laid up on high, lest love begun on earth Continuance should miss beyond the grave. There, from the world cut off, a world they find Of breadth sufficient for immortal souls To move unstraitened, while the gentle queens Of the poor fir-wood cottages with groups Of prattling children aid the indoor tasks Of husbandry, by Virgil's graceful muse So touchingly depicted; and the long Dark months of winter are illumined there By that serenity of inward mood Which simple wants engender, and true love Heightens, sustains, and ratifies, content With earth, yet with its dearest hopes beyond. Now the eighth spring unto the Hermit came: From the warm sunny lowlands, like a tide, It mounted up the rivers to the vales And rocky bays; no crash of avalanche Relaxing its strong grasp, no fall of earth, Or burst of angry torrents sounded there. But day by day the pearly streams outgrew Their parsimonious trickling, and amused The attentive ear with merry tinkling songs, Swelled with a pleasant science, as the sun Thawed the white drifts, to widely dashing falls Sonorous in the midnight hills. The rooks, Those noisy builders, on their tasks intent, Rifled the mossy slopes and from the trees Snapped the light twigs, impatient to renew Domestic bliss, while on the sunny banks A hardy primrose here and there stole out And looked the weak sun in the face, nor closed Its yellow eye through all the frosty night. Seven years of silent solitude, seven years Of outward beauty acting on a heart, Humbled through penance cheerfully endured, Left not Sir Lancelot the man he was When he disturbed the heron in the sedge That melancholy day by Kentmere side. Sweet changeâthe world-worn heart can well attest Its sweetnessâo'er his softened spirit came With dewy freshness: and who will not own How mountain winds and cold pure breaths of sea Unclasp the pain which girds the aching brow, And snap the anxious languors that are hung As fillets round the victim who is led A sacrifice unto the world's false gods, Riches, or honor, or invidious place? Chief and most holy change, by nature half, And half by grace, to nature next of kin, Wrought on the Penitent, was in his faith, Which now was elevated far above Sublimest heights which reason ever gains. For feeling went along with every truth, Raising the lofty doctrines of the Creed To those high places in the patient mind Where they the veneration should receive Of the whole man. The very atmosphere Of his keen intellect was purified, As an indwelling faith did more absorb Each day his lesser faculties; the light, Which o'er the regions of his fancy spread, All truths presented in dimension just And solemn clearness, beautified no less By distances through reverence interposed, While dealing with the mysteries of Heaven. As in the intervals of summer rain, When the low clouds hang softly o'er the earth, And the dark verdure is enriched with showers, The light, like eloquence unto the ear, Fixes the listening eye, which with a joy Fathoms the cool transparent depths of air, Wherein the distant objects seem so close It were a feat not hard across the vale To lean, and gather ferns or flowers that wave Upon the mountain opposite: even such And so translucent was the atmosphere In which his inward faculties abode And all their several offices discharged, Yielding their subsidies unto the work Of grace now stirring deeply in his soul. Darkness and daylight, moon and braided stars, Waters and flowers, the habits and the joys Of all the inferior creatures, now he saw, Saw and received them in his loving heart; And by such visitations was his mind With more than earthly wisdom so enriched, That with the Universal Presence he Came into fearful contact every hour. Yet was it not sensation vague or dim, Mere love of beauty, wondrously diffused In all things like a soul, nor idle rest In profitless sublimities, which are But exclamations of poetic minds, And bind no wholesome yoke upon the heart. The presence that was round him was the Hand Of a compassionate Master, throned apart From all things, yet Himself sustaining all, With all concurring yet from all distinct, Fountain of duty, and Himself our law, The Living God, the Spirit, Son, and Sire! Thus with his spirit did the wilderness On God's behalf in solemn fashion plead, Yea, sometimes with an influence that seemed With an imploring utterance to urge An attitude of thought more self-rebuked, More consciously abased before the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness manifested there, The Threefold Cord which binds the frame of earth, And whence the dome of heaven suspended hangs. All nature seemed to labor with a sense As of the hidden Deity, and oft Appeared as though she would unveil the shrine Which now she covers, while the patient eye Through her thin vesture may discern its shape, And build upon its pattern a sweet shrine Far in the silence of deep thought withdrawn. The sounds of nature, the loud waterfall, The sea-like surges of the wind, the hum Of busy midnight like a thousand looms Weaving the darkness for the hours, all were The Voice of God in earthly cadence veiled. The brightness of the earth and air and sea, The radiant lineaments of day and night, Stedfast or tremulous, shadowy or serene, Did at the least, if not much more, reflect The Eye, to Which all hearts of men lie bare. And silence might be thought,âbut specially The deep, impassioned silence of the hills,â To be that awful, listening Ear of God, At Which the sounding world all day and night With crying beasts, and infinite speech of man, Lies close, and not a rustling in the wood, Nor whispered sin, nor inarticulate thought, From that unsleeping Audience can escape. O miserably barren is the mind By feeling unsustained, the reason cold And, because cold, untrue, which in its acts And formal operations misseth not The plaintive adjuncts of the heart, nor craves Alliance with the wants of humankind, Smiles not when others smile, nor weeps with them, Nor in a unity of hope delights, And in communion of belief still less, But, wrapped in selfish ease, from out itself Works to a lonely end, and self-absorbed Can watch an empire fall, a church grow weak, And say wise things upon their waning powers, With calmness uttered, not with prayers or tears, And which it falsely deems philosophy! O piteously betrayed is that young life, Which sees a grandeur in high thoughts exiled From general sympathy, and fain would dwell In a poor orbit of loves, hopes, and faiths Outside the beatings of the common heart Of venerable nature! Doubly poor The self-sustaining intellect whose creed Is subject to itself, no outward help, No strong ally from heavenly places come, No solid tower from whence the soul may take Her observations, and from them divine Of things to come and hidden destinies Which, half perceived, may be her present scope. Ah! liberty, unwisely coveted, Slavish exemption from obedient love, To have a reason wherein is enshrined No truth acknowleged greater than ourselves, Permitted o'er our littleness to cast Consoling shadows, and to which we pay An inward homage of our fear and love, And through that ritual, not unaided, grow, Meting ourselves with measure thus sublime, Up to the standard of divinest truths! Far otherwise in his most worldly days Had been Sir Lancelot's mind, with feeling fraught, Mingling his moral being with the powers Of his keen intellect, and to the faith Of Holy Church submissive with an awe Intelligent, not servile, and deep love. To him the Creed substantial wisdom was, Objective to himself, and bearing up As a strong hand the feeble faith of man. Therefore it was that in his solitude His faith had failed him not, nor his whole mind Collapsed upon itself in weak dismay, When bodily health or lively spirits ceased To feed self-trust, but called on him to lean On holier aids external to himself, In ritual appliances made known, Or through a wise obedience to the Church Acknowledged as the visible Ground of Truth. There was no need for nature to achieve The healing of an intellect debased Through unbelief or frivolous self-trust. But the blind darkness of his moral eye, Successive films by years of sin induced, She couched by small degrees: her beauty was Medicinal, her operation slow But durable; and something there appeared Of sweet solicitude in all her shows, While they applied perpetual euphrasy Unto his moral vision; and sometimes, When hope of pardon due proportion lost Unto the greatness of his sins, and doubt, Injected so, remained unwelcome guest, She wanted not a virtue to dislodge, By trivial apparitions oft supplied, The intrusive stranger. From the high hill-top In the calm sunshine did the Knight look down Upon a frolic breeze below at play With the light tresses of a grove of ash; And there was something in the gentle shock, Wherewith sight did her office when surprised Far off by objects she was used to judge While hearing sate assessor at her side, Which to uncertainty could reconcile The inward mind, and, exorcising doubt, Give a more ample liberty to faith As to an eye, of reason's aid most glad, Yet needing not the alliance which it claims. And to this elevation of his faith Were added now a trembling happiness And scattered joys, which beat within his heart Like intermitting pulses. By degrees A softness of demeanor gently stole Upon him, and he bore himself as one Acting before the sight of those he loves, Or a meek Saint, with mindful reverence fraught Of those angelic witnesses who turn Their beautiful regards on all he does, Whether in attitude of prayer composed Before his Crucifix of mossy wood, Or with calm gait abroad among the fields Seeking salubrious herbs, his simple fare. Thus was it with Sir Lancelot: and there grew A pensive tenderness within his mind, That soon bade fair to over-rule the gloom Which by ascetic ways he daily strove To deepen: a meek tenderness it was, In localized affections taking root, Whence, out in life, domestic joys proceed And household sanctities, then only safe When anchored to the earth by local ties. This new and gradual softening of the heart, Which stole upon him like a silent bliss, A feeling was, akin to love, disclosed In what may not inaptly be described As the domestic joys of lonely life, The recompenses to the hermit given For the sweet charities he has forsworn. Not mean or few are they: the sense of home Hangs like a charm about the lonely place; And solitary nooks are set apart With daily consecrations, by some hour Of prayer remembered, or some gift of tears, Or some disclosure of long-pondered truth Whose actual dawn broke on the spirit there. And somewhat too of mute significance And various character becomes impressed Upon the solitude; here morning shines Earliest and warmest; there the green arcades Suggest a lurking-place at sultry noon; And there in evening's shadow it is sweet Upon the valley's sombre side to walk, And with responsive gaiety look forth Upon the sunlit mountain opposite. The bonds of sympathy are drawn more close Between the inferior creatures and the heart, Whether it be to birds that on the spray Close to the door at morn or eve may chant, Or to the patient kine, and bleating tribes, The nomads of the moorland, which send down A plaintive greeting from the windy heights. Nor do the deep affections want the power, Whereby inanimate things may be embraced Within the heart of man with pure delight And wisdom not unthoughtful, till the flowers, The many-featured trees, the dropping springs, And frowning rocks, are thankfully received And entertained as social presences. These were his joys, to him true pleasures tried By actual use, of real meaning full. Yet ah! the bare recital but sets forth The poverty of his enjoyments, sheds A gleam which lightens only to betray, A wandering gleam which but illuminates The solemn waste of his uncheerful life. From such a scene how gratefully the heart Turns to the sweetly-peopled hermitage Of private life, where faith and holy hope Are perfected in trials manifold, And earthly love from heavenly love receives A blissful unction; and the days serene Vibrate with gentlest impulse up to Heaven, Spent in the chaste delights not deemed unfit To shadow forth God's love to humankind, And even, a greater mystery still, the bonds Which link the Bridegroom to His Holy Church. O evening! how thy gentle-footed hours Glide on with silent pace! thy silver tonguesâ How happily they tell the lapse of time, More happily were it less swiftly.âOh! Like the calm wafting of angelic wings Revolve the days and nights, in love and prayer, And mutual study of the blessÃ¨d Word, And interchange of pure imaginings, And humble confidence, and reverence bought By meek confession of besetting sins And mingled tears repentant, setting forth To all the neighborhood an image sweet Of love in heavenly places felt! O Homes, Ye countless Christian Homes, that in the Church Are like so many grace-encircled shrines Where pilgrims rest upon their way to heaven, And run while they are resting! Happy Homes, Of conjugal self-sacrifice and love, Heroic, equable, calm-tempered love, Where the sweet Son of God is known and loved, And the dear Queen of heaven keeps watch and ward O'er all life's daily round! Oh! blameless joy Tenfold enhanced, when to a listening ring Of youthful faces the parental lips, God's Voice, to childish faith oracular, With patient repetition strive to teach The Prayer of Jesus or the great Belief Of Christian ages, or the angel's words Hailing the Maiden-Mother of our God, So sweet to childish ears, on childish lips So doubly pleasant, while with anxious mind, Discernment quickened by parental love, Each, mutual solace seeking, doth predict, The father now, and now the mother's heart, From infant graces or expanding faults The fortunes of these little ones of Christ. Of earthly scenes this is the one most sweet, Most graceful; but to faith's exploring eye What beautiful solemnity is there, What imagery of the Ways Divine! The timid children to the Father look, Yet by the Mother's eye directed, who With such mute eloquence refers them there For wisdom or support, yet wanting not A vocal intercession when distress Or penitent misdoing so may need, An intercessionâlet the world attest How rarely missing of the grace it asks! That isolated hill, whereon the Cell Behind the ash-tree curtain stood concealed, Was by a tinkling stream half clasped, which steered In the long summer heats in glossy threads Of amber-colored water through a breadth Of azure gravel, sparkling in the sun With fragments of bright glistering ore detached By vernal torrents from the mountain near. Beneath a slope of waving broom there was A little earthy bay that slept apart From the main stream, which now Sir Lancelot's care With beaten turf had banked, and made secure By two small sluices skilfully contrived, Whereat the cool fresh waters entrance won, And, making circuit of the hollow bay, Laving its verdant lips with mimic tides, Found egress by a slanting channel delved Across the sward, and with blue pebbles lined, Which to the current gave a song-like sound. With silver dace and speckled trout the creek Was populous; for so the Knight preserved What with his skilful hand he had ensnared In little hollows or beneath the stones; For love of the pure creatures, not for food Preserved, for by his hermitage no flame Of crackling fire or wreath of smoke went up, Token of human life. The fishy pool With willow-herb was edged, and with a fringe Of pithy rush, and tall osmunda's plumes, And juicy stalks of brittle orpine made; And a dead hawthorn stood upon the bank, Whose mossy branches summer yearly clothed In pointed ruffles of lank bryony, Rich in autumnal corals that the winds Unclasp with difficulty from the boughs. Upon the middle of the bay there swam A single Water-Lily, cradled there In ceaseless agitation: year by year That Lily came, and ever came alone, By its green cordage anchored in the pool. So merrily the lively waters shook The central deep, and made the rushes nod, And with brisk bubbles round the Lily wheeled, They suffered not the snaky root to spread Amid the shifting ooze; so there it stayed With its one yearly blossom from the deep, Like the old queen of beauty, rising up, A solitary planet which diffused A flickering radiance on the bubbles near And on the rushy rampart of dark green,â A beautiful and waving orb of light. Ah me! how sweet are joys when we have few, Whose advent expectation prophecies Far off, and on whose legacy of thought Contented memory lives long afterwards! Such was that virgin Lily to the Knight, Which chiefly by its touching singleness Moved him as no inapt similitude Of his own being, anchored safely now Within the arbor of those lonely hills, But that in its meek celibate the flower Knew neither sin nor penitence; but bloomed In dutiful contentment on the pool, Fulfilling for its hour the Will of Heaven: Yet paler than was wont, for so it seemed, A beauty sisterless, and like a star Whose lonely twinkling rather grieves the eye, Suggesting absent joys with thoughts that cloud The vision of its solitary light; And eager like a spirit to descend Beneath its veil of waters, when the touch Of autumn gave it leave, a gentle touch Upon its tremulous eyelids,âsensitive As the love-broken heart of tender maid, Who, wasting inwardly, grows daily less A thing of earth, and meekly greeting death As her deliverance, vanishes away More like an apparition than a life Of flesh and blood, of smiles and tears, like ours. For that lone Lily on the waters cold, That fallen star, for so it might be deemed, Which nightly to the distant moon looked up With its unsteady eye, Sir Lancelot felt A simple love, a moving of the heart Which not ungratefully would find relief Full oft in tears. There with a lover's hope, Which no delays abate, he watched till spring, Leaning invisibly across the pool, Whispered the Lily from her dreaming sleep, Lulled by the booming waters overhead. But, when the breathing accents bade her wake, The child of nature rose, and gently shook The sprinkled ooze from off her genial couch, And through the pleased and yielding waters went, And, drawing her white wimple o'er her face, She stood in nature's presence, while the sun, Respecting her forlorn estate, allowed Her beauty to decline his ardent gaze. Silent companion all the summer long Was she unto the Knight, and to his thought There was within that flower a light and look With which he communed inwardly, as though A sweet intelligence was deeply couched Within the lovely orb, whose starry smile Among the sunbeams rippled on the bay. Amid the crowd of Forms and fair Delights Which beauty scattered o'er the hills and dells, And lawns and woods, and rocks with herbage veined, That pallid Lily's solitary gleam Stood forth among them all, with single power Contending, and eclipsing all; so deep Was her one image graven on his heart. For in that glorious wilderness she seemed An eye of nature, open visibly, By that light flowery fringe but half concealed, And bent with eloquent regards on him, And with a wooing sensitively felt Within the pensive quiet of his heart! Such is the love of nature, and the sweet Sufficiency of single objects, lodged Deep in the Oriental, gently tranced With love of single trees or chosen fount. Such is the passion, if so wild a name To that mute worship may be given, beheld Upon the features of the silent groups Among the graves collected on the knolls Which overhang Stamboul, what time the sun Sinks o'er the golden downs of grassy Thrace, In meditation rapt upon the dead, Or on the blissful Unity of God, Believed unhappily, or with the love More oft transported of the dreamlike scene Which glitters at their feet. For hours they sit While joy without a tide or pulse o'erflows Their tranquil contemplations, all possessed, Through every inlet of their being filled, With love of nature as a source of prayer. The cooing of a lonely ringdove locked Within the fibrous fans of cypress leaves, A single eye of deep blue sea beheld Through the light foliage of the terebinth, The evening breath which from the Euxine steals, Heard fluttering in the walnut branches stirred By the cool Bosphorusâthese for many an hour They worship with unmoving eye, as joys Even to the disembodied souls which sit Upon the heaving waves of turf around. And yet no Arab in the wilderness So loved his solitary palm, no Turk His sunset-gilded cypress, as the Knight That virgin Lily, gently looking up From off the moonlit bay into his face, An eye o'erflowed with spiritual love! And nought assisted more to raise his heart Above his gloomy thoughts than this sweet flower, Haunting his deep affections with a love Serene and simple, while old happiness Was daily gathering strength for its return. In vain he called up mighty powers of will And masculine resolve to lay the sprite; Still it returned, like waves upon the shore; And in his own despite he daily grew A man of gentler thoughts and lighter heart. But this new lightening of his spirit seemed A pleasure not legitimately his, And joy, a stranger long, was entertained With almost terror, lest his penitence Should thereby miss of its accomplishment, And with suspicion which went far to abate Its joyousness. But nature's yoke was on him, Mild yet irrevocably fixed, and claimed Over his fickle moods serenest sway, A safe and pleasant empire, if he durst Yield himself up to it without reserve. This year, so chance was over-ruled, all things Conspired against his efforts to retrieve His ancient sadness; for the vernal months With an elysian softness early stole Into the vales, and earth and sky performed Their genial functions with a gayer rite And more abounding grace than they were wont. And, for the first time since Sir Lancelot came, Now in this year the foreign cuckoo threw His homeless cry into that hollow dell. And never had the many songs of birds The sylvan chantries so frequented, never With choral harmonies responsive sent From off the vale's two sides, alternating, With such a festal celebration paid To God their vernal service of sweet sound. How vocal too was evening, when the spring Came with a gift of balmy showers, which filled The twilight with cool incense from the earth And aromatic shoots, while in the rain With scattered voices many a thrush prolonged The vesper hymn, and in each pause the ear Caught the low whispered undersong of leaves Struck by the rain-drops, like the distant chords Of harps whose sound the breezes intercept! And not in all the seven preceding years Had the sweet woodland tapestries been flung So separately forth in wild-flower webs, Or with such plain distinction of the kinds, And with a spotless broidery less marred By earthy raindrops. Or to other eyes That long variety of flowers might seem, As month by month they defiled o'er the ground, A Flemish guild, wherein the several trades, By banners known, or cognizances quaint, In waves of colour sinuously float Along the streets of Bruges. In kinds they came, Lawful successions, leading mimic pomps Through the tall grass or round the twisted roots; And with calm grace each company withdrew, Like a soft cloud borne further by the breeze, Before the straggling blooms which, in advance Of their own bands, seemed forward equerries Of their procession coming into sight. The doorway of the Hermitage looked out Upon a sunny bank of hazel wood, With moist rich veins of moorland turf between, Winding irriguously among the copse; And frequent openings showed of softest lawn, Screened by the natural trellis of the boughs, Which very homes of checquered sunshine seemed, All interspersed with lichen-spotted rocks Whose crevices were bearded with wild thyme, And cuckoo-plant in pendent threads o'erhung With kindly veil the portals of the wren. Mid the dark stems beneath whose twilight shade It was too dark for grass, the woodland floor A thin apparel of sweet herbs put on, A plaited work of knotted tendrils, lined With silky moss of dusky golden dye, Which, gently bruised beneath the foot of one Intruding through the copse, exhaled a scent As though the earth had medicated been With freshly moistened spice and odorous drugs. And shelving slopes of broken stones were there, Enclasped with filaments of rosy moss, And chained with belts of ivy to the ground, While o'er the whole as at a venture thrown,â Whether a growth of earth or air might be A doubt, when it was swimming in the breeze,â A gossamer of emerald fibres spun, With flowery points of vivid white besprent,â The cross-wort with a delicate array Of holy forms enough to have supplied All nature were she bent on a crusade. There on that bank Sir Lancelot might watch The flowery troops in pageant moveable, Both as they came and as they disappeared. First, like a flock of children, purely white, The snow-drops lead the van, while every breeze Seems visibly to drift the lovely foam Upon the knolls; so sweetly do they take Each mossy nook and arbor by surprise. Then, as one gazes on the evening sky And sees the stars in little flashes come Each to its place, so on the vernal earth, Mocking the eye, the yellow primrose starts, Till, ere the doubting sight be yet convinced, The wood is twinkling with a thousand eyes; And, by harmonious shading reconciled With that low-lying atmosphere of stars, The deep Lent-lilies glow among the flowers Like constellations girt with lesser orbs. Next, and most loved, as seeming to restore The snow-drops perished in their infancy, Comes that aerial veil of bridal white, The thick anemones, which rather seem The southwind's breath to mortal eye made plain Than droves of separate flowers. Ere they be passed Begins the march, spring hath no pomp more fair, Of hyacinths which ring their purple bells Into the drowsy ear of fragrant May, Most spiritual chimes which none can hear But poets slumbering sweetly in the shade. When these are gone how vacant is the green Of the same sward, a smooth and wind-swept floor Where, like the intervals of some bright pomp By groups in holyday attire engrossed, The sprinkled orchis wanders up and down With lychnis tender-eyed, and Bethlehem's star Among the tufted spear-grass glimmering, And, happy he who finds it! alkanet With its deep ocean blue and bearded leaves With crisp and silvery prickles studded o'er,â With the bird-primrose joined, the mealy plant Whose pale pink leaves with gilt effulgence glow, Streamed from the eye which like a sunbeam sleeps Concentered in the hollow of the flower. Then the red honeysuckle sits aloft, All like a maiden queen with robe of state, In attitude of one enthroned, her train In royal folds depending from the boughs: Till, like the rippling light of distant sea Divulged by flying sunbeam far away, There comes a silent glittering o'er the earth, The advent of the sylvan pimpernel; And, when the day is still, the greensward seems With living glowworms tremblingly inflamed, Or when the wind breathes softly up the brook A myriad eyes are winking in the sun, And flashing golden light from off the earth. Then the proud foxgloves bear their crimson wands In solemn beauty o'er the summer woods, Nor yet disdain the melancholy bees Plaining perpetually within their bells. And, as they fade, the feathery meadow-sweet, With undulating censer prodigal, Drugs the warm breezes with its potent breath, Through all the leafy shrines ubiquitous. And, last, from autumn's oozy ground there springs The snowy blossom, of Parnassus named, Which in its cup of pencilled porcelain Great Rome's pontifical insignia bears, Five peacocks' fans with tremulous green eyes; And great St. John's wort guards the priestly flower Through the dark woods with iron-mottled dress And ebon-headed mace, while frosty winds Send the loose rabble of autumnal leaves In picturesque confusion thus to close The annual Procession of the Flowers. BOOK IV. THE JOURNEY. Not when in glittering mail along the streets Of Tarsus, conqueror in the tournament Sir Lancelot reined in his Arab steed,â Not when, with dreams of love and war entranced, In the clear moonbeam by his tent he stood That night, and saw cold-running Cydnus sleep Mid citron groves (the frigid stream that gave A well-nigh mortal chill to Philip's son, And laid the imperial Frederick in the tomb, What time he expiated in Crusade His disobedience to the will of Rome, In Venice humbled) while far off the Falls Solemn disturbance made among the woods, And snowy Taurus glimmered like a star, Or some celestial beacon newly raised, The moon outfacing on the throne of night,â Not then when youth its pleasant firstfruits paid, And manhood with the ways of men began To deal, with sense of power and growing pride And inward exultation, was the Knight So blythe, or by magnificence of thought So loftily above the world sustained, As when, a Penitent in sackcloth shirt And pilgrim's mantle worn, the day and night Came to him in that green and lonesome vale. Firmer his step, and, as more happy now, So was he slower in his walk, and apt, By pressing thoughts arrested, to stand still For long together, by his little bay Or on the moors or in the shady groves,â A pensive shadow, flitting now, now still: Where'er the thought detained him there he stood. The mysteries of self, which to the eye Of conscience half alarmed, a lonely life, Tedious expositor! full oft unfolds, 'Twere vain to sing. Who hath the sounding line, Prophet or bard, or haply both in one, If union such be left, who hath the line Wherewith to fathom the profound abyss, Or height, if so it should be rather named, Of speculation won in solitude? A lesson terrible to learn and long, Dismal the school, magnificent the prize, Is that concentrating of the faculties Of heart and mind in loneliness acquired. No throng of worldly objects breaks the array Of silent thought; no many-colored life Stands in the front of God and intercepts The awful tokens of His Presence here; Nor cares benumb the sensibilities Then quick to recognize the touch of Heaven Where'er the solemn contact be vouchsafed, Oft given, and oft unheeded, in the glare And flying tumult of our outward lives, Save when divine afflictions interpose, And open Heaven in vision to the soul By dropping darkness o'er the dazzling world. Meanwhile the herd of lower faculties, Of earthly fashion, slumber undisturbed. No puzzling multitude of avenues Lead to the regal chambers of the soul; But one alone stands open, ever watched By silence, or, which is a thing as still, The sounds of nature undisplaced by man. And thus the soul before the Eye of God Is bare and open, as the midnight plain Lies vacant to the shining of the moon. And those few powers of mind, which have been shaped In their original form as instruments Of such transcending intercourse, become, When used alone, of comprehensive reach And more than mortal grasp. Even as the blind For one dull organ gain a recompence In the strange quickening of some other power, In musical perception of sweet sounds, Or in a marvellous discernment given Unto the sense of touch; so doth the soul, Nurtured in thoughtful solitude, perceive Its nobler faculties thus magnified By concentration and adoring prayer, Whose energy is husbanded, nor lost In spendthrift joys by fickle sense pursued, Or poor delights of thought which gilds but earth, And sings in lazy bowers of war and love, And than such vain excitement seeks no more. For seven long years Sir Lancelot now had been The mate of solitude, and I would fain, In unambitious verse as best beseems The thoughts I must encounter on my path, And names employ of dreadest sanctity, Somewhat of this interior life depict, By language hardly compassed, yet the soul, Through feeling and the weakness of my words Informed in part, the rest may well divine. Unwise is he who in the calm of age Lightly regards the doings of his youth, And, with false wisdom meting out the past, Counts it but as the memory of a land Through which he travelled in his way; but far, Far more unwise is he who, being young, Conceives a disesteem of youth, affects To speak dishonorably of its powers, And to deny that, in its changeful moods, There dwells creative order that evokes The spiritual fabric of our lives From that wild sea of impulse, which may boast, Though hard to find, a true philosophy. How joyously the waters of the world With many murmurs sound about our youth, As o'er the haven bar it shoots, and turns Eastward or westward with uncertain will! But, after leaving port, full oft there comes In the first night a silent hand which gives The helm a new direction, and at dawn, Sole evidence of change! we see the towers And lighthouse of our childhood's harbor, touched With sunbeams in an unexpected place. Nought is there so minute, no wish so weak, But at that season it may change our course And shift our stars; nay, sometimes it may chance A dream will turn the rudder of our lives. Thus in the heat of his chivalric youth Sir Lancelot had dreamed a vivid dream, Which gave some color to his after-years. Down in the valley of the Drave the tents Were pitched in sunset's eye, while to the west The opening gorge with such resplendent dower Of myriad hues was filled, as best beseemed The climbing road whose end was Italy, The paradise of European dreams, And goal of envious tribes. Sir Lancelot, By what thoughts urged young love alone may tell, Fled from the noisy wassail of the camp, And up the sounding dell of Siser went, The Drave's romantic tributary; there The moonless night came on him mid the pines. The mountains towered above, or rather hung, And in the luminous darkness seemed to grow To supernatural bulk, and to contract A frown each moment deepening: to the south A crescent Alp rose up with fractured cove, In some contortion of the deluge rent And disembowelled, or in olden time The mouth of subterraneous flame, whose lips, Chafed by the fiery tongue, had fallen in. A sheeny glacier on the creviced slope Its icy talons fixed, and down the hill With annual progress like a tortoise crawled, Doubtless is crawling now, while summer noon And its relaxing ether smooth the path, A path more slowly travelled in the frosts Of winter, yet incessantly pursued, By night and day the varying seasons round. The feet of destiny are not more slow Than that mute creature; haply not so sure, If the calm intercession of the Saints, Or prayer of living Church, arrest her steps. The white-robed mountain shed a wild wan light In lieu of the absent moon, such light mayhap As earth to other worlds may be ordained Itself to shed. A thousand glittering stars Were braided in the pinetops or impaled Upon the spearlike leaves, and with the trees Appeared upon the low night-wind to sway. And with inwoven dances, such as were By feet of Delian maidens once performed, When they set forth the wanderings of their isle In mythic steps to tinkling citherns timed, The fireflies played around the pillared stems, And bore about their lanterns of green light, Advancing and receding while the eye Measured by them the depth of sylvan gloom. And one small globe, in purple darkness set Like emeralds, with a statelier measure wheeled Over the foaming Siser, which o'er leaped With gleamy flash a sheer and dizzy rock; While with the breeze that stirred the withered leaves Cool gusts of incense crept about the wood. There did Sir Lancelot sleep, his ample tent Of leaning pinetops was, made fast with stars. He slighted not the fragrant floor of earth, Nor feared the innocuous dews of summer night. He sank to sleep, while images swam round Of dearest import: to his eye there came The hall at Heversham, and rushy fields That seaward sloped; and in his ear the Kent Accustomed murmurs made among the boughs, While now and then with light and sudden splash A wakeful stag would bound across the stream, And seek a lair among the dewy fern: And with Ethida's name upon his lips The Knight passed onward to the fields of sleep, Where a sweet vision waited his approach. His eye, so seemed it in his slumber, strove To pierce the gloomy pinewood where it stretched, In misty length, a single sombre nave: While, one behind another ranged, the rings Of fireflies swung in circles of green light, Like rocking lamps suspended from a roof. There suddenly among the boughs the wind Breathed a last sigh, and with it swept away Those living stars, and all was silence round, The silentness of an expecting dream. Then at the close of that cathedral nave A white and radiant vapor softly grew, Dazzling and formless, which with silvery gleam Lay like a tremulous pavement round the stems. Far off, resplendent as an Altar-piece Illumined from behind, a Figure rose Of beauty such as art hath ne'er conceived, The Virgin Mother with her Infant Son. Upon her countenance, rounded like the moon, An orb of open features, was impressed The secret of her fortunes, which transcend The loftiest surmise of created mind. The sweet maternal instinct there divulged In deep impassioned silence, to whose depth Each lineament the while serenely lends An utterance almost vocal, then appeared Calmed and arrested by profounder thoughts, And by the intense tranquillity of bliss Brooding in chaste enjoyment on itself. And yet not wholly wanting was the look Of pensive self-collection that dispersed On the celestial seeming of her face A beautiful timidity, through which Her mortal birth o'er every feature reigned Triumphant, and harmoniously o'erruled The ineffable aspect which her heavenly lot Upon her face transferred, where extasy, Divinely glowing, by remembrances Of grief was deeply moved, yet not displaced. But in that Infant Saviour there appeared Nought of celestial origin involved In His fair features, where the loveliness Of mortal childhood singly was diffused:â Yet such a Child as might in Sanzio's soul Have dawned upon his seeking thoughts, and filled His beautiful conception to the brim. Smitten with love, where there was naught to check The bold adventure, no monition given Which might retard its unchastised approach, Sir Lancelot gazed in rapture on the Child. Worship of love he proffered, without fear, And felt no fear, all seemed so beautiful. Straightway the vision stirred; the Mother hid The Child, too long, too tenderly beheld, And a dim trouble up the surface passed Of that bright vaporous pavement spread around, Like the black curls of wind that crisp the lake. Anon the sheeted silver smoothed itself, And winding music played about the wood With ringing clearness, like the concord made By stars that slide with music in their grooves All day and night across the vocal spheres. From out the vapour with a tuneful noise Arose the Maiden Mother, with her head Star-crowned, her feet upon the subject globe, The writhing serpent bruised beneath her heel, Herself by grace assumed unto a throne And neighborhood unspeakable. Let verse Seek not for craft of language to declare The seeming of the Woman glorified, The mortal who was Mother of our God,â Him only, singly worshipped evermore, Singly, with equal glory to the Three! And underneath the globe was laid a tomb, O'er which the twelve Apostles bending gazed, Interpreting the marvel of the flowers, The white and speckless lilies, that broke forth And momently grew, budded, flowered, and swung Their waxen censers in the vacant tomb. Guiding the eyes of nations and of times Aloft the Virgin pointed to her Son, In palpable Divinity enthroned, Yet lacking not one token of that birth His creature was elected to confer. Enough: such visions were familiar then, And to the spirit of that age akin, Mingling the uncertain with the true, while yet They ministered to real works of grace. Enough that Lancelot from that day forth, In the true knightly fashion of the times, Was sworn a serf of Mary, with a vow Made inwardly, and worshipping full oft With worship falling short and frustrated By youthful inconsistencies, below That high devotion which belongs of right Unto the majesty of Mary, queen Of heaven, and empress of the Sacred Heart,â Yet worship such as sanctified his life, And quietly detained him near to God, Such worship as infallibly secures Its purity to youth, or to old age The placid harbour of repentant love. Now in his mountain harbor, in the calm Of sheltered solitude, he loved to muse Upon the Mother-Maid, nor sought to pierce With bold enquiry that mysterious ring, Where she is sphered apart from all the lives Of us her fellow mortals, a reserve Of honorable thought to her assigned, Special, as is the blessing which our lips In careful reverence couple with her name. Enough that round her starry throne are stored The precious treasures of redeeming grace, Which grow beneath her hands, and multiply In miracles of mercy; and enough That easier access, so her Son hath willed, Is nowhere granted to the sighs and tears Of those for whom He bled upon the Cross; Enough that Mary hath become a part Of the dear law of grace,âan aqueduct, Strong and far-reaching, on all shores and times With prudent prodigality to turn The torrents of divine compassion, once Poured forth on Calvary,âan ordinance Pervading all the ways of God,âa truth Laid deep in the foundations of the faith, And part of its integrity,âa power, Which whoso slights, shall rue it evermore. O Mystery to Christian souls endeared! O chaste Virginity so sweetly crowning Maternal Love! what wonder that thou art A joy to contemplate from age to age, Such blending of all purities as draws Unto itself the countless hearts of men, And once drew God to take a Human Heart? And yet, not resting here, Sir Lancelot's love Went sounding onward. With a feeble flight,â A feebleness that daily gathered strength As he was more and more assoiled from sinâ He tried the further depths of grace divine, Further and further, by the upward light Of that pure Mystery conducted thither, Till so from love of Mary to the love Of Jesus he adventured, while he learned Through her transcending office to explore The depth of that descent which Love essayed, When Christ from everlasting glory came, And was incarnate, by His creature helped,â O rare compassion! O most dear design!â With Veil of Flesh and Body Virginal. Yet, self-disdaining sinner as he was, An abject Penitent, he rather sought To find the glory of the Saviour's Throne By the sweet moonlight of that lesser truth: Unwisely, for Celestial Love is found Man's neighbor, not in circuits to be reached, But like an Angel cleaving to his side. He that loves Jesus must already love The Mother whom He loved Himself with love Surpassing words; and he who truly loves The Mother hath already shrined the Son In his heart's best affections, far above All other loves, beyond all love of her. Nay, our dear Lord will sometimes seem to hold Our love of Him as homage less direct Than that which at His Mother's feet we lay, Either to teach us to what marvellous height He hath assumed His creature, or to show To what abyss His condescensions reach. Thus in his love of Mary had the Knight Gained what he purposed only to approach, And needed not to seek the Son beyond Who with His Mother was already found, And to that Mother led the soul at first. Yet such to his abasement had appeared The lowlier wisdom, while through homage paid Unto the Virgin Mother of the Lord The Lord Himself was sought, and through that way Love seemed to climb an easier ascent, And even faith more sweetly venturous Appeared, and Heaven far more within his reach. While in past years he sojourned in the east Something of a mysterious chance, heaven-sent, His life had there encountered, whence he drew This faith,âthat he who would exorcise sin Must strive by meditative power to place Before his eyes in darkness and in light The gracious aspect of his Suffering Lord, An Apparition facing him all hours, As palpably to tenant the blank air, As if he saw a moving Crucifix Meeting his eye with shadowy regards, Such as on Peter rested in the hall, Which, like a sunrise, look all sin away. In lowliness to this most solemn task He now betook himself, unaided there By bodily similitudes which lift The earth-attracted heart above the earth, And by a monitory impulse raise Our difficult devotions, and sustain Them raised, until they freely breathe the air Of faith's sublimest region: such supports In loving wisdom doth the Church accord, To him in that lone valley not vouchsafed. But simple nature with maternal skill, A willing fellow-worker, might supply, Whether of knotted growths that had forestalled Device of art, or pliant matter shaped With facile toil, an image of the Cross, Which he had reared upon his lowly cell, And on two points which earliest sunrise struck And latest sunset left, and in those bowers And oratories of the open air Which he frequented most, and there he taught The indocile ivy to restrain its wreaths, And with an unambitious clasp to sign The Cross upon the bosom of the wood. With such appliance armed, he bent his mind In long continuous musing on that Form And grave benignant Aspect, which he strove By power of inward habit to project Into the unpeopled light and vacant gloom, Outwardly realized, which, like the Ark Of wandering Israel, moving or at rest, In permanent companionship might bless, And as It blessed, absolve and canonize The long outgoings of his months and years. The help of speech, and that access of power Which meditation gains from utterance, And vocal plaints from time to time indulged, He was denied, a penance self-imposed, And meekly borne. So with intense desire And inward recollection now he strove By recitation of the blessÃ¨d Creeds To imprint a lively Image of our Lord Upon his spirit. With unflagging strain And unrelaxing grasp of thought he held His mind long poised upon each wondrous Clause, Each gracious lineament of saving truth, Until the countenance of the Written Faith Broke forth in silent voices, and each word Sang like a trumpet in his inmost soul: And with the ringing sound his fleshy heart Glowed like a furnace, till the Type of Him Whose love it echoed was annealed thereon. Even so, when on the Tuscan Apennine Descending autumn down the beechwood slope Her russet mantle trailed, St. Francis knelt. His spirit hung in stedfast rapture far Above the atmosphere of vocal prayer, While 'twixt the beamy Seraph's folded wings He saw the Sacred Effigy depending; And from the gracious Wounds, five Wells of health To stanch the sensual issues of our sins, There came five rays of light which was not born Of sun or moon, but from that Orb detached That sheds on Sion streets eternal day;â The city undisclosed, whose outlines faint Tremble with indistinct pulsation now, Like sunset quivering on the clouds of night, Upon the bosom of the earthly Church. Those starry pencils on his fleshly frame, By cleansing fast and vigil now sublimed, Haply by love, too, partially transformed, As, when the Judgment-Fire is passed, all flesh Shall be,âplayed for a little while, and left, By their sharp radiance copied to the life, The Saviour's awful Wounds. Such solemn power Imagination on the bodily limbs Usurps, concurring with intensest love And long unbroken singleness of thought, And with miraculous effort outwardly Reveals the habitual aspect of the heart, As grace and nature in the work combine. Thus, by a hundred witnessed, Francis came Down from Alvernia, like a vessel sealed, And stigmatized in fashion as his Lord. Another means Sir Lancelot took to win The vision that he sought, a means well known To every generation of the Saintsâ By meditating livelong days and nights On our Lord's Passion. Step by step he went Along that Road of Sorrows, till he seemed Even in the boldness of his pity moved To glide into our Saviour's place, and toil Beneath the salutary Burden, laid Upon the Guiltless for the guilty's sake. O dearest Fount of sadness and of weeping! How few there are in all this busy world That turn aside to drink thy sacred stream! Was ever grief like that? Was ever woe Divine as His, so blessedly endeared To every human heart whose mortal pains Additional fulfilments of our curse Have been, darkening the earth? Oh ancient Grief! The countless ages cry a blessing on thee! From out the depths of poverty where dwell The Unnumbered, the Neglected, comes the song Of sorrow that hath broken forth in hymns Exultingly: and from the high-born, kings, And peers, and palatines, and famous minds, And goldy warriors, sounds in stately march The music of their world-renouncing vows. O Grief of griefs! with what celestial love Inflamed, we ponder on that Holy Week, Within whose seven diurnal rounds compressed Lies the whole sum and substance of the world, The measure of all time, the ultimate crown Of human destinies and Love Divine, All, all in one completion centring deep, The Star that through the Passion gleams in sign Beneficent, the ever-blessed Cross! Thus with determinate effort he retrieved What memory in her faithful keeping held In depths a mother's words alone can reach, The order of those Sacred Woes, and form Of their procession, by the Spirit shown To man fourfold from four celestial towers Of contemplation, movingly pourtrayed, And with pathetic variations touched, Touched and illumed, by blest Evangelists. Yet, craving every help, the more to prop The unsteady balance of an earthly mind, Upon the western slope of that lone hill Whereon he dwelt, above the valley raised And from the heights detached, he for himself A Kreuzberg made. A difficult ascent He chose, a steep and natural stair time-worn Amid the jutting stones, and to the wind And rains with such a bleak exposure laid As had repelled the meagre skin of moss Which strove to creep upon the scalps of rock. And now upon that rugged slope did he Choose fourteen eminences, whence to frame As many Stations of remembrance, havens Where thought, and with thought prayer, might disembark In its too rapid voyage, and on the capes Might worship of that monumental shore, Which he was coasting with exceeding fear. And, at the Stations, to the rocks he tied A simple Cross, erect save at the spots Which should recall the sinking of our Lord Beneath His Burden; there he laid the Sign Prostrate upon the stone, and with a cord Of supple ivy bound it in its place. And at the summit in a fissure grew A blasted holly, from whose trunk he cut The withered boughs, but two he left, alive And branching from the stem on either side, So that it stood upon that slab of rock, Facing the sunset, as a living Cross. There at each Station daily on his knees He wept; for to the Knight the gift of tears In like abundant measure had been given With him, Assisi's Saint, whose streaming eyes Gushed out with water for the holy Law Of Jesus slighted among men, as though, Invested with such function, they were called To be vicarious fountains of remorse For all mankind, and, ever on the verge Of blindness trembling, only wept the more, And still to him the sunshine was ensured By marvel, so men deemed, till near his death, If death such calm translation might be named. And not displeased was he full oft to find Upon each tightly-fastened Cross the wool Left by the intrusive sheep, whose presence there To his thought desecrated not the place, But left appropriate tribute on the Sign Of the true Lamb, as men should lay their sins Upon the Cross, as though from servitude Might those inferior creatures be redeemed, Whose snowy fleeces on the mountain side Gleam, like the righteousness that shall displace Our guilt, and whose most patient wrongs and pains Elected are to bear about in type, In language of a plaintive import preached Oft to dull ears, the Passion of our Lord. There, on that steep by touching symbols made A sanctuary, did he now confront That history of woe, which is not woe To sinful man, but everlasting weal. Thus, on its melancholy sweetness fed, And by the pressure of the holy Creeds Upon his inward spirit, and by hope, And faith unfeignÃ¨d, and assiduous love, The personal image of our Saviour grew Before his eyes, a Presence on the air Depicted, and with self-sufficing light Upon the field of darkness silently Irradiate; such a Type as haunted once The bashful intellect of Christian Art In mountainous Umbria, when before the face Of re-awakening paganism she fled, Taking amid the barren Apennines Those Moulds and Aspects of a tender grace Divinely pure,âthe Mother and the Son, The Desert-Preacher, and the lineaments Of the great Twelve, with Paul and Barnabas Born out of time,âfrom ancient days received, And in the western family preserved Of deep traditions, while the east ran wild In forms debased. In exile over these With reverential homage Christian Art Brooded with many a tear, and mid those rocks Died of neglect, or haply seemed to die, Surviving still, a sleeper in the caves Where truths withdrawn await another hour. Such Image now Sir Lancelot beheld Fronting him day and night; such blessed Type Was his, a benediction evermore. And at all seasons, whether day-break came, And on the foreheads of the eastern hills Ran over with an unction of sweet light, As from a cup filled slowly, or the peaks, In evening's downy purple richly garbed, Seemed from their daylight nearness to retire, This Pictured Faith was present to his eye. But, chiefly and most calmly, was it prized In the cold quiet of autumnal days, When by the leaf-choked streams he took his road, Or the dim-curtained afternoons of mist, Of sobbing mist and intermitting rain, Whene'er the silent-weeping woods all day With melancholy dripping on crisp leaves Foster a pleasant sadness, and there come Sounds, as of children wakening from a dream, Of raindrops soaking through the withered herbs, Or creatures searching for their holes, obscured By some accession of decay, or shower Of yellow leaves in silent circle dropped, Each underneath the bough on which it grew. Environed therefore with such gracious aids, And with such spiritual furtherance now Abetted, was it strange that he should feel Deep joy, almost sufficiency, therein? Yet such his lowliness of temper, such The habitual self-abasement of his mind, The very rising of a happy thought Disquieted his covetous research Of sorrow, and his love of gloomy fears, Sought as a duty, mercifully foiled. He was a suitor of sad thoughts, but still Nature was glad around him, and the peace Of God was in his heart, and every day Brought some new pleasure to the birth, some joy That stood more clear of such incumbrances As interposed before; and many a time Was he a prisoner taken unawares In his own gladness, by a pleasant guile Entrapped: even as a melancholy man, Who with a lovely child may walk abroad, With his own griefs too much in sympathy, Or by the torture of unsettled thought Abstracted from the soothing images Of nature close at hand; yet when he sees How every face of every passer by Relaxes into pleasure, shares at length The general sunshine, and pursues his way Caressing his sweet satellite, and full Of gladness such as is the food of tears. Such change now grew upon him as he fain Would disallow, although by what designs To counteract it he perceived not yet. So much he saw, that he must first dislodge That sense of home and localized repose Which even to that poor wilderness attached And scene of lone self-chastisement, whose forms Were by embodied memories now endeared, And by the friendly aspect of the fields Worn, when the heart and earth appear to come To mutual understanding, through long years Associate, and vicissitudes of lot,â While things around, outgrowing their cold charm Of novelty, their vacant freedom seem To abjure, till they are peopled, like the isles Or happy fields where fable placed the shades, With all our past existence bright and dark. Then, with strange joy that life had yet to show A field of self-denial unexplored, With firm resolve he left the Ash-tree Cell, As the eighth summer of his sojourn there Gave early autumn leave to reign by night O'er that green realm which she still ruled by day. On Lammas Day at morn Sir Lancelot went, Turning his back upon the quiet port, Whereat the damage of his soul had been Repaired with such a noiseless skill. He climbed The moor with hurried steps as in distrust Of his own purpose, for he felt how much He left behind in leaving that calm vale. Onward he mounted with an obstinate gaze Fixed on the blank blue sky, as though his heart Had sworn an oath unto itself that he Would send no backward lingering looks. But still, The more he strove to cast his thoughts in front, The more they lagged behind. The very forms Of the old places faced him as he walked. The sister ash-trees and the low-browed cell, The well-known aspect of its open door, Which with a greeting of mute cognizance Met his returning eye, the church-like breath Of frankincense that ruled within from boughs Of withered pine, the lily on her bay Dimpling in nature's solitary eye The lucid waters with faint flashing light, The Crosses on the Kreuzberg with the wool Left by the sheepflocks fluttering in the breeze, Like the last leaves of autumn,âall came round And stood before him, palpable and clear As he well knew his backward-looking sight Could yet encounter them. But with a speed Such knowledge only quickened, up the hill He strained, and some few footsteps interposed A ridge between the valley and himself; And then Sir Lancelot turned to look behind. The vacant waste of cold fresh waves that meet The morning gaze of him who yesternight Slept, by the crescent lights of some huge port Embraced, could bring a not more sad surprise Than that new landscape which he now beheld. His eyes, that teemed with such sweet images And household forms in vivid groups, now fell Upon a sunny slope of verdant moor, With rocky slabs of azure grey, whereon The sun and shower with emulous intent Bright maps of yellow lichen had designed, And sailing low with flight that almost brushed The grass, a buzzard-cock with creaking wings And melancholy whistle swept along. And now two loitering hours were gone, consumed In frequent halts, before the Knight came down The western spur of Kirkstone, on whose slope A little hamlet stood, securely wedged Between two hills; a place it was that seemed Half houses and half foliage, interspersed With such sweet skill that one might almost doubt Whether the human habitations preyed Upon the original forest, or the wood Encroached upon the village, such an air Of peace there was and natural solitude. And calmly rose in curling volumes blue The reeling spires of smoke, and to a stream Of upper wind ascending, they were curved, And, melting in the sunbeams, faded off, Dissolved in odors vague of burning peat. And to the Knight, a northern born, no scent More delicately grateful e'er could wrap His sense in livelier memories of the past. For eight long penal years no fires of man Had cheered him, with their tale so softly told Of social bliss, and quiet histories Of wedded hearts and faithful loves obscure. And now with thankful spirit he inhaled The unexpected fragrance, like a man Whose memory some most pleasant thought eludes Long time, and meets him at a sudden turn In far-off lands, a pilgrim like himself. That morning smoke! what depths did it unlock Of childhood, by the pressure of stern years Forcibly closed, or by the chill of age Congealed, and wintry selfishness! What days Of boyish plans to fish in distant tarns, To rifle some chance brood of eaglets found By shepherd boy, or steal the wild swan's eggs, When through the half-awakened villages The early peat-smoke with the cold bright air Mingled its pleasant incense as he rode, All in his mother's life-time,âmemory clung To later things with less tenacious hold;â All rose upon his mind and gently shook, As morning shakes the dew-drops in the wood, The depth of feeling, with a power as calm As spring when at the bottom of the streams She bids the long-haired plants anoint their locks With lustrous verdure for her bridal morn. Ah! not untruthful is the wondrous light Wherein the soul abides, with noblest thoughts Begirt, that wait their hour of utterance, When Memory with Imagination sits, Twin monarchs, throned upon the quiet mind: Even as the rising moon and setting sun Reign over no disparted realm, but each Fills the whole circuit of the heavens with light Peculiarly its own, and yet so merged In mutual government, the very sun In moonlight sets, the moon in sunshine climbs. And not untruthful too, for all its sweetness, Is that illumination which converts The soul into a silent fairy-land By sleight of memory, when the happy Past Is with the Present gracefully involved. So to one wandering in the tarnished woods Beneath the bright autumnal moon, the boughs, Half-stripped, appear in May's imperfect leaves Of lucid green but just attired; the orb Restoring, while it hides their present hue, That old transparent coloring of the spring. Such double office when the memory fills, Confusing times and places, who shall say Whether it be the Present that illumes The Past, or that same Past which is the moon Of the fair present? Such perplexity Of joy, half extricated from the shade Of sadness, now beset Sir Lancelot's mind, And solving this sweet doubt he took his way. Among the closed and silent cottages He went, much wondering at the novel sight, Till on the air there rose a joyous chant, A treble of thin childish voices, stealing Upon the quiet place and through the wood, Like the faint murmur of a brook dispersed, Mastered by rustling leaves and sighing airs. Thus, by the music guided, he arrived Where o'er a wall a drooping wych-elm hung And roofed full half the road, which suddenly Dipped down a steep descent, and there he found A beautiful procession winding by, The Guild of August in its old array. The countrymen in holiday attire, And dames in Sunday kirtles, and a troop, Chief actors they, of little boys and girls Bearing religious emblems, marched along To celebrate their Loaf-Mass at the shrine Of sweet St. Catherine by the silver mere, With Host of ripest and selected ears Of that year's corn, its happy first-fruits, made. A fragrant basket of the new-won hay, Amid those hills in early autumn won, They bore in front, and wands of braided rush With wild flowers filleted, and Crosses three In simple thought of pastoral art devised. One with a flower-like wreath of marvellous plumes And radiant feathers trimmed, from wondrous lands Beyond the sea by one far-travelled brought For his betrothed, by her more fitly given For such good end than used for personal pride. Another was there all of virgin white, Circled with one live twig of leafy vine That neither too much hid nor too much showed The gleaming outline of the symbol dear; No fruitage grew depending from the stalk, For He who hung upon that Tree of Life Himself was fruit, and other needed none. The third more like a natural growth of earth Appeared, with cup-moss overgrown, and crust Of beautiful green things akin to moss. Then followed many a bright and gaudy show And quaint device significant, and most Fluttered with dangling chains and knotted rush, In honor, doubtless, of St. Peter's Chains Of which the Church memorial makes that day. Onward they marched; the weak-voiced choir still sang The Benedicite for rural wealth, For that year's vigorous growth of sappy wood, For new-won hay and promise of the corn. Sweetly it rose, though feebly, for 'twas ruled That they alone who had not toiled should sing. In truth a goodly sight it was, and type To make men wisely sad, to see the feet Of children tottering with a lofty Cross Of weight beyond their own, and seeking aid, Like souls that stay themselves upon the Church, Their hands within their mothers' locked, to bear Their honorable burdens to the lake. Still on the selfsame spur of Kirkstone lives The ancestral custom, from its day displaced Insensibly through lapse of time, or act Of those unweeting of its ancient form. Still is that flowery chain of olden time By pressure of long centuries unsnapped; And I would pray, that have good right to pray, A foreigner adopted to the hearths Of that fair town and freedom of the hills, That, from the troubled centre of the land By nature cast apart, her sons may long With simpler wants more readily obey The instincts of a simpler faith, and live In the calm light of cheerful usages, And rites and truths of happy ancient days! O'ercome by thoughts, where pain acutely strove With joy, Sir Lancelot stayed behind to weep. Onward the pageant swept; no turning eye Witnessed his presence at the village pomp; For all, both hearts and eyes, were forward bent To gray St. Catherine's on Winander's shore. And, when the querulous voices of the band Now died far off, he left the road and passed A purling brook which fenced an ancient park, That so he might not cross the peopled path Of that sweet vision. But another sight, Less fair, he now was destined to confront. Down a steep lawn there ran a green arcade Trelliced with boughs of Glastonbury thorn, Beneath whose open shade three flights of steps, Cut in the ground and clothed with native sward, Led from a postern of a Saxon hall Down to the park; and at the wicket gate, Which closed that covered way, a falconer stood: Four birds in scarlet cowls upon his staff Sedately perched, erect and motionless; And two dark palfreys by a groom were held, In trappings gay for lady's use attired, Who to that pastime, from the Saracens At first imported, now were sallying forth. Behind the drooping umbrage of a tree Sir Lancelot stood, while down the dim arcade, Like beams of light, two youthful maidens came. In energy of mirth, and overflow Of words in some grave presence long pent up, Their voices, like a peal of silver bells, In falls of laughter rang, most musical, As if the very pulse of joy herself Its rapid beatings clothed in bodily sound. Blythely they talked, and by the Holy Mass They ratified this idle speech or that, Or of our Virgin Lady's sainted name Made frequent use and frivolous; yet they chanced On such light words and with such feminine air Of innocent pretence, that he who blamed, Except to save his conscience as a priest, In hall and bower was deemed a base-born churl: And who so hardy as resist the world When it would canonize a graceful sin? Onward they hastened to a little mere That northward lay, and wafted down the vale By fits there came those silvery peals of mirth. Forth from his covert too Sir Lancelot went; Each laughing sound that struck his ear but seemed To spur him forward: not the morning smoke, Nor simple psalmody of childish choir, Wielded the powers of memory with a strength And speed more irresistible than now The voices of those children of the world. No images of blameless times, past years Whose shades are not less soothing than their light, No distant landscapes of the long-left shore Of childhood, did these present sounds invoke; But sinful joys, deluding dreams of power, The vanity of enterprise in arms, Months of soft self-indulgence, and wild hours Lost in oblivious revel with his peers, Or while he plied the bootless trade of love,â And all that comfortless eclipse of Heaven Which youth calls knowledge of the world, and buys, As men bought power of Satan, with a bond Written in blood, a woful covenant. How merrily those laughters seemed to freight The quiet of the vale! How long the breeze Played with the sound! yet to Sir Lancelot's ear It was a joyless, nay, an awful sound. It fell with such interpretation there As baffled all its lavish melody. None but a child would deem the passing-bell Blythe music, yet it woos to happier thoughts Than all the songs and viols of the world. Westward Sir Lancelot bent his steps, nor knew By what blind choice he was impelled that way. Such the strange instinct working in the hearts Of agÃ¨d men, who with habitual mood Creep o'er the meadows to the setting sun, Their feeble backs bent down and aspect prone, With tardy effort from the different stiles Freeing their limbs; yet ever by that lure, That golden light, which gives them back their years, And from the ground flows upward to their eyes, Drawn on, forget to measure with their strength The distance of that unillumined way They must perforce return. So westward went The Knight, and by the Brathay's glittering shore Rested at noon, where, opposite, there rose A single hill, the transcript of his own In Troutbeck Vale, a miniature, whose base Half by a mountain road was clipped, and half By the dark flood and mural parapet Of tall osmunda with its halberds green. And o'er the shady slope there lightly swung A latticed network of depending ash, Whose scanty elegance of foliage served Rather for aid to guide the exploring eye To tempting coverts and moss couches spread In sun-proof dingles, mid the whispering boughs, And in the audience of the murmuring stream. What though, retired in our calm temperate noons, No admonition to the ear is given By snow-white campanero in the woods, From leafy turrets tolling, like the bell Of distant convent, all along the shore Of turbid Demerara, summoning The quiet listening creatures, and poor slaves, To prayer in that intolerable hour When toil were death;âyet by the lisping leaves, The gurgling of cool waters, and the sounds That one by one are ceasing in the fields, Noon here invites the soul to thought and prayer. And thus Sir Lancelot profitably mused, With penitent acknowledgments relieved By tears of gratitude and speechless praise, Upon the double vision of that morn, Those Aspects and those Voices which revealed The twofold Powers, the friend and foe of man, The Church and World, each travelling on its way. Then up the stream he went through rushy fields, Or paths with trampled elderberries stained, And knolls of grateful wood, until a ring Of ancient oaks the secret entrance marked Of a deep transverse valley: thence he passed, Enchanted, through the sylvan paradise Of Tilberth waite, and Yewdale's rocky shades And grimly purpled steeps, and to the right Ascending, wound along the stony flank Of a tall mountain from whose terraced side His eye could rest upon a sunny lake, Spread riverlike in silvery maze behind. BOOK V. BLACK COMBE. The seasons are the keys of song: they can Rich store of modulated thought unlock; But as in their ethereal wards they turn There is full oft a sound of storm in heaven, And sun and shower upon alternate winds Ride in disordered speed across the earth. But in the change, when summer's faltering hand Yields her capricious sceptre to the grasp Of noble autumn, days will intervene Of an elysian softness which belongs To other lands, not by our seasons claimed; A short-lived regency may it be deemed, By some mild southern influence controlled. And autumn prematurely came this year, Or summer ended, from her place disturbed By shocks of almost tropic thunderstorms. Sir Lancelot journeyed slowly in the heat, And halted often, not so much to rest As to admire the beauty circumfused With oriental softness in the air. The sky was blue, but by a pearly haze Most exquisitely veiled; the little clouds Lay motionless in some bright element Of molten silver, which they had absorbed Until they shone like planets up on high, Or sunny fleets that rock far off at sea, Half hidden by illuminated foam. Eastward the distant mountains hung like banks Of toppling cloud, in tremulous violet hue Or marvellous tint of roseate green arrayed; While to the north a lazy stifled wind Trailed a white mist transparent o'er the hills, Where, to unreal distance thrown, Scawfell Was palpitating in the haze. Yet while The unwonted aspect of the lovely day Of eastern lands reminded him, one thing There was which to our clime recalled his thoughts: It was the dim perspective of the view. The vigorous outline, lucid and compressed, And the clear darkness of the shadows thrown Steadfast and motionless, the firmness given To the faint aspect of the distant hills, Temples, and groves of trees, are special gifts Pertaining to the radiant atmosphere And landscapes of a southern latitude. But, to imagination far more rich And to the reverential eye more sweet, And by Sir Lancelot now confessed a charm More graceful, are our waving outlines fixed With an aerial trembling, while the earth With glimmering motion on her anchor rides, Tempting the eye, well pleased to be so lured, To rifle all the unsettled hills and shades Of nodding wood, and piece by piece retrieve The distant objects slowly floating up Out of the vague obscurity wherein (The fairy-land confusion of the noon) They swim, sometimes approaching to the sight, Sometimes receding, as a ship will miss The harbour-mouth, by feeble gusts betrayed. But lo! a lucid rim of brazen light Steals o'er the northern hills, and from the abyss Fabrics of castellated cloud mount up, Labouring to roll themselves above the heights, And, as in their unwieldy toil they dash Against the mountains, muffled voices come Of growling thunder, while the panting breeze, First intermitting, wholly dies away. It was a tempest such as rarely sounds Among these English hills, and by a gale Of wind succeeded, in whose boisterous rage The creaking woods fell prostrate, and loose rocks Clove their rough paths among the belts of pine, A storm shortlived as fierce. Sir Lancelot, Who once in woody Lebanon had dwelt At ZarklÃ¨ opposite the hoary plain Of silent Balbec with the Maronites, Thought of the snowy Sannin, in whose womb Terrific storms are gendered; and the past, Roused into wild accordance with the wrath Of the blind elements, within him raged, And with a swift eruption of hot thoughts Ravaged that pure tranquillity, which made His inmost heart for years a holy home Of penitence, and very cell of prayer. The storm had slackened; on a platform green With hurried step the Excommunicate Was driven to and fro by his wild thoughts. Beneath was Duddon raving in the glen, Now visible, now by a drifting shower Of sleet half veiled or utterly obscured, While the lashed mountain-sides were heard to moan Beneath the impetuous cataracts of wind. Soon, like a ponderous pageant upon wheels, The mass of toppling clouds and flying mists Rolled seaward, bellowing as it went: and then Came the sweet sovereignty of azure sky, And the warm sun, and breezes musical, Not unacknowledged in the woe-worn heart Of the lone penitent. He knelt and prayed; And when he rose, there was within his soul A lightening which was almost happiness, A sense that mercy did not yet disdain To soothe his conscience. And a pomp ensued With such significant slowness on the hills And such surpassing beauty, that his eye, Fed from the scene, sustained his weary heart. A mountain of a varying outline rose Entangled in a vast array of mist, Here dense and fleecy, there a lucid gauze, Like a bride's veil, most beautiful to see. Sometimes in tortuous columns it rolled forth As from the chambers of the mountain breathed; Rearing its broad unsteady bulk aloft, It seemed by sunlight kindled from within: Then all at once it broke and fell, as if Dropped suddenly from some invisible hand, While it disclosed a hundred dizzy feet Of peak and precipice; then in the grasp Of strong and eager wind caught up again, As with a hurried impulse it involved The mountain all in white: and it appeared Like some gigantic creature that was torn Upon the craggy armour of the hill, And now lay writhing in contortions huge And pitiful, with its voluminous spires Catching a silver sunbeam here and there. But soon the lacerated monster trailed Itself across the ledges of rude scar, And on the top of some subordinate heights, Fir-capped, in five enormous folds coiled up Sullen, but in repose the creature lay, While to the open air and clear sunshine The mountain sprung, a bold and buoyant height. There, sculptured on the bending dome of sky, A frieze of clouds in beautiful relief Glowed on the ethereal concave of the west; Even like a land far off at sea evoked From underneath the horizon by some spell Of playful light into the upper air. A chain of rosy mountains did it seem, Fretted with shades of blue, and veins of pearl Hung from the heights like trickling waterfalls Voiceless, though fluent, on a summer day. And folds of evening wood appeared to sleep Upon those mountain sides, and single pines On forward eminences stood, and rows Of black-barred cedars, and the tapering spires Of silky birch, and from the sunny glens Rose up the smoke of fairy villages Sunk in the cloudy gorges, and dark towers And old cathedrals with effulgent domes Were for awhile sustained before the eye By the sweet light, which is its minister, And then effaced. O beautiful Effect! Wrought by the love of God to elevate Our love to Him, and thus subserve His praise! How grateful is it to the impatient sight Of those returning to their mountain home, However brief their exile, so to meet This prophecy, in characters of cloud Engraved, of their own mountains still unseen, And with what all-sufficient joy they view That heavenly imitation of the earth, That exquisite and silent land of clouds! And gorgeous preparation did the sun That evening make for his descent, a play Of such ethereal intermingling hues And blazonry of mists no painter durst Depict their faithful unreality. There dropped upon the hills, as though from heaven, A vest of coloured air, for scarce a haze Might it be named, so thin it was, in truth Impalpable but for its watery tints. Half purple and half crimson did it seem, Wherein the mountains rose, all girded round With shining bars of motionless white cloud, While on the channelled vale of greenest turf There lay a flood of rosy brightness shot Slant-wise with gold in tremulous dusky threads, Through which the green, unmingled, unabsorbed, Gleamed with the raindrops. O how fair the view When evening wandered up the vale, and touched With gentlest visitation hoary cliff And hanging wood and lawny mountain side. Yet was the beauty heightened and set off By many a plain memorial of the storm. The foamy Duddon forced his clamorous way Amid the opposing straits of rock, or brawled With pebbly sound across the shingle blue, Which in the morning sun had glanced like beds Of diamond or topaz: and the brooks, Sequestered in the few collateral glens, Raised to a strain more loud than they were wont Their tributary music, soft-voiced streams Half-stifled in the echoing ravines By the close-roofing foliage overhead: And, sweeter symbol still of recent storm, The pleasant exhalations of the woods,â Fir-stem, and mossy earth, and silver birch With aromatic breath,âhow fragrant all! Like the soft converse of a heart which hath But lately learned in tears and sufferings deep The kindly wisdom of adversity, And through meek bearing purchased a degree In that exalted faculty, whose lore More heavenly is than aught on earth beside. Firmer and yet more hollow grows the voice Of ancient Duddon, and more palpable The tingling of the woodlands, as the night Advances her engrossing silence there. Along the uneven edges of the hills The gradual muster of the stars begins, While the green groves turn glossy and obscure. How overbearing is the loveliness Of night, the night divine! with her dread show Thus hushing all the timorous earth to rest; As though, in some supernal mantle swathed, A sailing spirit waved his awful wing Scarcely above the surface. How intense The tranquil midnight of that sunken vale! All sounds, the motions of the fluttering breeze, The mirth of insects, and the troublous sighs From the tall summits of unsleeping wind,â All seem suspended as by angel's hand, And gathered out from the responsive air, That one Sound only, one dread Sould of sound, Might in its fulness overflow the vale With influence unannoyed. That Sound it is Which in the Word of Life, both Old and New, Bears the commission to set forth in type, And nightly illustrate, the Voice of God,â The Sound of Many Waters, calm and strong, Most clear, most mighty; as the thunder loud, When the near storm its rolling voice divides With sharp articulation mid the rocks, Yet spiritual and subtle in the air, The earth, the boughs, as are the whisperings Of a man's conscience in his solitude. Sir Lancelot's soul rose in him, like a flower From which the sun with timely slowness lifts The burden of the rain, and from whose blooms The sprinkled soil falls off and leaves no stain. His heart, o'ercharged with thankfulness, was soothed, And by the very soothing roused to sing, As if that Voice of waters in the vale Called for his voice to give it words of praise. Great God and Father! (so in thought he sang, Thought that could hardly keep itself from words,) Great God and Father! to acknowledge thus In night, silent or vocal, evermore Thy Presence with Thy creatures, doth fatigue The enraptured and adoring intellect. O raise my soul and spirit, and attune My body to their heights, that so I may,â Not with intensity of love outworn, With beauty restless, or with terror chafed, Or by solemnity dispirited,â But with a lowly mind and venturous heart Of child's affection, worship Thee, First Cause, Fountain of Godhead, sole and unapproached, Thine equal Son, from all eternity Thy Son, to all eternity True Man, And Thee too, infinite, coequal Spirit, The personal and abiding Comforter, And fallen sinner's diligent Paracleteâ Thee may I worship, Blessed Trinity, Creator, Saviour, Paraclete of man! In all the glories both of night and day, Of land and ocean, mountain-top and dale: But specially vouchsafe that in the night And darkness, too symbolical of sin, No idle thoughts, nor evil haunting past, May claim my heart, while I the rather seek, Even in my midnight fears, a fount of love, Of breathless prayer and musings grave and high. Thee, by the action of a restless mind And the quick beatings of a heart unweaned From earth, can I escape or shun by day. The radiant magnificence of light Can be a hiding-place. Romantic turns, And alternations of a blended interest, The bold relief of colour, and the gay Distracting details of bright loveliness, Sweetly distracting,âthese are coverts all Where in the depths of daylight we may hide, Impatient of Thy Presence: but the night Disarms the spirit which had been so bold In the sun's eye to feel, to speak, to act; And in the starry concourse of the sky, The leaning moonlit mountains, and the woods By dusk illumination magnified, And above all in that deep typical Voice Of Many Waters, now authentic made By word of revelation, I discern Thine awful Presence, Majesty Supreme; And, by Thy Spirit thus solicited, I worship Thee with trembling utterance, checked Oft by adoring silence, till my heart, By thought of sweetest mercies over-borne, Mercies unasked far more than asked, will dare To weep for very love before Thy Feet! Along the sounding shore Sir Lancelot went, Till down the vale he saw the murky gleam Of the wet sands far off, which like a tongue Pierce the green woodlands there: then o'er a bridge He crossed the Duddon, and northwestward turned Over some mountain roots of shaggy copse, Till in the Vale of Whicham now he stood Beneath the stedfast shadow of Black Combe. From time to time a restless watchdog bayed, And a cock crew, or from the echoing hill The wolf's low whine, prolonged and multiplied, Possessed the ear of night and over-ruled All other sounds, until the fitful breeze, Impatient of the silence, woke once more And with the dashing of the torrents played, Throwing their music here and there at will. The moon hung low: the starry firmament, Shaking with lights innumerous, was spread Over the mountain like an eastern tent, Whose rocking lamps and swaying canopy Bend in the desert wind. The mighty hill Rose with the moon behind, and, in the shade And layers of purple darkness, seemed to swell Beyond the proper measure of its size, Through that appearance wherewith solemn night Is wont to magnify the glimmering earth. Sir Lancelot gazed upon its dusky breadth With reverence, while his inward awe confessed The more than common majesty which breathes From the mysterious features of Black Combe. Who for the first time sees that heavy hill, Sombre and pale, but he acknowledges Somewhat of its unwonted character, The fearfulness of its dark aspect joined With wild significance of feature, felt Deep in the spirit, puzzling thought to find Wherefore the presence of that singular height Lays such a weight upon the feeling heart? A dark attraction hath that mighty hill To fix the wandering gaze upon itself, Whether the eye may light on its green sides, Ruffled with combs of fretted rock, far off At sea to Mona or the Solway bound, Or in the distance looming, o'er the sands Of Duddon's sylvan estuary seen From Hawcoat or the end of Walney Isle, Or in smooth Whicham where the quiet air Is loaded with its shadow, while the sheep Graze silently around its verdant foot. A silent place is Whicham vale, and not Without some share of that impressive gloom Which clouds the neighbouring hill incessantly, A lonely spot which to the eye would seem Most melancholy, if a prattling brook In a damp woody channel overarched, Like those who sing most sweetly when they deem No audience nigh, did not full oft beguile The traveller's spirit with its merry chimes Half baffled by the matted roof of boughs, And yet more beautiful, false distance given Unto the strain, cheating the well-pleased ear. There the dark mountain stands, and seems like one In a grim slumber by enchantment bound Hard by the sea, whose murmur throws a voice Into its inner glens, a solemn sound Moaning along the treeless banks, less sweet Than the rill's local music undisturbed, But with a spell of power far more sublime And mournful fascination, heavily Ensnaring him who wanders there alone. No matter whence the breeze may set, from land Or from the sea, nor with what steady power It flows along, still overhead the clouds Mysteriously pause in their career, By huge Black Combe retarded in the sky, Dappling its brow with stationary shades From hour to hour; while all the summer long The wizard hill with an ethereal gloom, Soft and cÃ¦rulean, wraps his grassy flanks. For druid rite and horrid sacrifice Of savage faith, long ages past might choose A mountain-height thus visibly with awe Invested, to the dwellers there no less Than to chance travellers, or the sea-borne man Who in wild weather passes by that coast. Not unimpressive is it there to hear, Far in the heart of those green solitudes, The pastoral bleating of the flocks, annoyed, Yea, and displaced upon the silent moors, By the harsh plaining of the sea-fowl, driven By rude Atlantic storms to shelter there. How piteously they strew their broken cries O'er the wet surface of the quaking moors, Oft by the hillside echoes taken up And in the sinuous coves prolonged, as though That mountain were a giant horn whereon The sea might wind his own peculiar notes, Disheartening such plain lovers of the land As wander there, and question if Black Combe Be not a blending of both elements Most wild and mystical, throughout its breadth Claimed audibly by ocean for his own, The nuptial chamber of the earth and sea, With singular celebration set apart, And strangest rites prolonged from year to year. He hath but little of the poet's soul Who, passing underneath Black Combe, can go By Duddon's shore, or through the pleasant peace Of hollow Torver, or with southward course To the Cistercian seat in Frudernesse A pilgrim bent, and yet confess no weight Laid by the sea-side mountain on his heart, Or without difficulty extricates The blythe and smiling scenes through which he wends From out the shadow of that sombre height. While yet Sir Lancelot stood, in musing wrapped, The sunrise stole unto the higher ridge Of the dark mountain, and the crest appeared Through the thin mist as though it had been strewn, Not with the sunshine, but a flaky shower Of sprinkled snow, while on the sides beneath Dawn separated one by one bright knolls From out the purple mass, which swiftly grew Translucent with green light; then from above And from the vale beneath, both up and down At once, the daylight tremulously crept. Thereat the Knight commenced the smooth ascent, Betrayed full often by the slippery sward Already silvered by the moist sea-breeze, Which carries autumn prematurely there, And tarnishes the fern before its time. Nigh to the dreary summit of Black Combe There is a hideous fissure, scooped perchance By ponderous eddies when the deluge swayed Incumbent on the broken frame of earth. Therein Sir Lancelot fixed his hermitage, Wattled with clay and stakes in journeys brought Frequent and toilsome from the vale below. Behind the mountain's solid crest it stood From the rude northwind sheltered, and ensconced Behind a natural rampart of green turf, Safe from the wet and blustering south which throws Its greeting of salt spray upon the hill. The only objects from the door beheld Were seams of ruddy earth which interlaced The stony cliff,âtorrents of fluid soil When the tempestuous rains came roughly down, And sometimes lighted up as though the steep Were braced in wizard mail, with gilded plates Of sunshine with white silver riveted, As the wet trickling stones the brightness caught. It was a rougher life than he had spent In the old Ash-tree Hermitage; for here He had no vassals to forecast his wants. His toils were doubled and his scanty fare, Rude as it was, precariously supplied. Yet not unprofitable was the change,â A loss which over every feature threw Somewhat of doubt, which haply might evoke Meekness and trust, in little things most hard As aiding not to feed that self-respect, Whereon endurance leans with dignity, And a proud patience, for awhile sustained, Mimics the gait of Christian fortitude. A profitable task it was to learn Amid anxieties of such a sort, And petty hindrances, to keep unsoiled The springs of prayer, and copious as before. The hedgerow birds for whom the Lord purveys Have leisure morn and eve to sing His love: And even the abasement of a beggar's life Is hourly sowing, oft in sterile hearts, The seeds of patient love and happy faith. Then sometimes would be leave his lofty cell For days, and wander on the smooth sea-beach, Sleeping in ragged copses which deform That windy shore, or with a plank content Of some wrecked ship upon the moonlit sands. And round by pastoral Millum many a time Belated men would cross themselves, and tell How they, night-foundered in the forest, saw Sir Lancelot sleeping in a shaggy brake; While the red vivid embers of his fire, Fanned by the fitful airs, appeared to bring The gloom of midnight closer round, until The darkness hung in almost visible folds From bough to bough, like waving tapestries. And oft, attracted by the flickering light From the cold moor which bordered on the wood, With head and neck protruding through the leaves The kine were seen, guarding, the shepherds thought, Haply commissioned from above, the sleep Of that forlorn and solitary man;â Such patient vigilance and doubtful sense Of what the scene imported was portrayed In quiet fear upon their lineaments. And in their touching way the peasants called These midnight slumbers in the dusky wood His Rests in Egypt, prompted by the scene Rudely depicted on their chapel wall,â The wood in Egypt, where the rushing Nile Made a strange distant undersong all night, The lantern hung upon the broken bough Above St. Joseph's head, whose sleepless eyes From time to time explored the umbrage round, Yet ever came to rest upon the Child, As though the sight an admonition were To watchfulness; and, seated on the ground, Our Lady with her left hand held the Babe, And with her right she strove to shade her eyes From the red streaming lamp, that she might see His Countenance more clearly as He slept, While with affectionate caution she had drawn A wimple o'er His Face to keep the light From troubling His repose; and through the leaves, So dimly pictured, that, at first unseen, It only grew upon the eye that looked For long, the Ass with silent shadowy head Gazed on the Infant Saviour, as He slept, The only Sleeper there;âyet that wild scene With sweet felicity was named a Rest:â Calmer than sleep that Mother's pondering thoughts, Vigil for Christ the most restoring peace St. Joseph's heart could know, and for the Ass, To gaze on Him who saves both man and beast Lifted his patient nature to a calm Transcending far the purposes of sleep. Oft would Sir Lancelot wander from the Point Which fronts the Isle of Walney, to the north, Until the sacred headland of St. Bees Should greet his earnest gaze; but most he sought, For its peculiar desolation loved, That wild sea-bank, so beautiful and lone, Where ocean roughly knocks upon the strand, Or laves with fawning tongue the bright-ribbed shore, And hardly wins the admission which he seeks Into the sand-locked bay of Ravenglass; Where, but a reign before, a few poor men Set up their fish-garths at the mouth of Esk, Vassals protected by the powerful arm Of the bold Penningtons, and by the Sword Much more of great St. Michael, from whose shrine A blessing to the rugged fishers went, And nights serene upon the moonlit gulf. No common inlet is that jealous bay, A curious chamber where the Atlantic comes Smoothing his ruffled swell, and so receives With an innocuous ripple on his brow, (A graceful barter of the land and sea, The rental paid for his reluctant calm,) An ancient tribute of sweet waters, there Brought by three vassal streams which gently mix Their mountain music with that other strain, The sea's soft thunder on the outer shore. The Esk there is, by clusters of wild tarns Suckled in sylvan places, which shoots forth From its rich vale by lordly Muncaster, And shallow Mite, which from its moorland dell, Winding amid low dislocated hills, Comes lisping o'er the pebbles; and clear Irt, Translucent as his solitary lake That images Seatallan when the sun Burns in the glowing sky, with many a bend Affectionately lingering near the hills, Clasping and then unclasping many a knoll, Procrastinates his meeting with the deep; Fetching a wayward sweep almost to touch The sea, he runs within the shore awhile, Until, by ocean found in his strange creek, Spite of his skill he yields at length to fate, And mingles his sweet crystals with the brine. Four years a Hermit was the Knight enclosed Within that mountain's solitary heart. An utter solitude it was, yet not By silentness enhanced, but resonant With a perpetual sound which might appal The timid listener in the depth of night, Or in the misty calm of noonday moors. Whether it was the murmur of the sea Which travelled heavily among the glens, The meeting of far echoes, or the moan Of some unsleeping wind in that drear place, Or the thick respiration of the hill While to the sunshine it exhaled its mists, Or greedily imbibed the globes of dew, Or if it were the sailing of the clouds Whose rudders made the cloven ether sound,â I know not, but a resonance there is, Strange and perpetual, in that savage hill. The wind is viewless: but its voice and path Are spiritual; upon the mountain side It leaves no impress; sea or inland lake Sustain it, as the hard highways may bear A chariot or the throng of nimble hoofs; A momentary ruffling of the dust, A momentary drifting of the spray, And all is over; on the waving woods The elastic foliage starts ere it be passed, And with a studious speed obliterates The wake it scored upon it now; and who could hope One livelong day to chronicle the winds Or fluttering breezes which at times may throw Into the mantled faces of the woods Expression sweet, and skilfully displace The show of mute reserve wherewith they hide (As Holy Church secretes her mystic truths And touching rites, until with voiceless call The Spirit, for the humbling of an age Or its tuition, may solicit them, In glad spontaneous teaching then expressed) Their beautiful interiors, trunk and branch, Sylvan arcades, and dimly lighted naves, And marigold windows pierced among the leaves, And transepts dusk, and crypts of underwood With honeysuckle groined? Ah! who could hope To fix in song the beauty of one day Written upon the woods, and by the wind Upon their flexile lineaments impressed, And at one stroke expunged? Such interchange Of look have those green seas! Like fruitless task Is his, who should endeavour to record The daily path which natural objects make Across the spirit, trailing hope and fear Like ploughshares after them, that, not by chance, Here idly skim the surface, there indent A furrow which the man walks in for years, But knows not when or how it was upturned. Beauty and terror, sunshine, storm, and calm, Write their obscure inscriptions as they pass, Rarely decyphered then; the feeling heart Counts the bright landscapes which have moved her, dates From sunsets, rainbows, or cool starry nights Which, with a strange prerogative endowed, Inward or outward, above other nights That were as bright, as cool, as beautiful, Have troubled her so sweetly with a sense Of joy, or influx of poetic power. Thus nature acted on Sir Lancelot's soul, Spreading her blameless empire in the dark, And now and then in chance disclosures gave A sign, whereby to measure the degree Of inward change her influence had wrought. Somewhat of rude sublimity there was, By strange ennobling circumstance conferred, Which o'er that Excommunicated Man Hung like a cloud of glorious thoughts, when they Beset the astonished minstrel; and his mind, To a continuous adoration strung, Sustained his bodily strength, insensible To the rough agency of heat and cold. Even such propinquity there often is 'Twixt miracles and nature's humbler works, Those higher or lower cycles which embrace In single law the order of the world; Single, yet with distracting aspects seen By our weak minds, which therefore have disjoined Palpable wonders from the common things So much more wonderful, that their true size Transcends the measures of our mortal thoughts, And we account them but for what they seem. Thus the elevation of Sir Lancelot's mind Hardened his bodily frame, till he approached The eye undimmed, the unabated force, Which on the Hebrew lawgiver of old The frequent Presence of the Almighty shed, When years went by and furrowed not his brow, And toil inspired had wearied not his limbs. Amid those high capacious solitudes The silent stars beheld the Man insphered Among themselves; and there alone he sat, The ample brow of that dread height his chair, In musing wrapt, above the reveries Of blind astrologer, and communing With that intelligent Presence in himself Wherewith our being is possessed through faith, And heavenly hope, and silent love of God, And works of mercy, shadows of the Cross. Yet like ChaldÃ¦an mystic might he seem, Who in the plain of Tigris, on a knoll Above the undulating vapor raised, Ponders the starry writing of the skies. On that high chair, a more than kingly throne, His thoughts were crowned by local dignity, Sharing the elevation of the place, And the strong freedom of the lofty height. Above the clouds or in them, or in air With cold and pallid brightness circumfused, Whose dewy breathings made the stars appear To waver in the dome, he sat; and there Full many a night with those three powers conversed, The Moon, the Mountain, and the Sea. Dread life It was, unearthly, yet not all of Heaven; A life wherein each passing hour he feltâ Inwardly bleeding as he warred therewithâ The vehement beatings of the impeded soul Against the bars and hindrances, which met Its upward aspirations, while it clung Unto a thousand relics of self-love, And in the very act the union loathed: Disheartening warfare were it not for faith, For supernatural alliances In worlds unknown contracted by the soul, For heavenly gifts, inlayings deep and rich Of Sacraments, forbidding us to deem Unworthily of our immortal flesh, No longer ours alone, incorporate And knit with His, a mortal Maiden's Son, And Word Eternal! Therefore we endure The languor of this miserable strife, As being with Him Who is invisible,â More truly present with our Lord in Heaven Than absent from His Presence while on earth. BOOK VI. THE SPIRIT OF THE SEA. Magnificent, and, I would dare to think Intuitive, the courage of the man, The immortal Genoese, the demi-god Of modern legend, who upon that sea Sublimely shado wed over by a cloud Of ignorant faiths, once turned his dipping prow Right onward to discover worlds unknown, And boldly plunged into the Atlantic fogs, Lost to his age behind the fearful sea, And no less hidden from it in the depth And darkness of his solemn thoughts, withdrawn Into the unshared grandeur of his dream. Him I behold in spirit on the waves Some breezy midnight contemplate the stars, And pierce with gaze intense the livid gloom Through which his prow sang cheerfully, and then, With a blind motion suddenly possessed, Twist the helm north or south with daring hand, Impelled he knew not why, and yet elate And tranquil, as a mighty seer who knows How far his incantations may prevail. Such, on his solitary mind at sea, Was now the bearing of Sir Lancelot. On Troutbeck Hill the mountain's rugged arms Had clasped his spirit in a rude embrace, And so confined his thoughts till they should search The chambers of his conscience o'er and o'er, And with the scourge of self-condemning grief Should cleanse the temple. Now the ocean waves Burst like a vision of infinity Upon his heart and soul and intellect, A sight as new, as strange, as wonderful As though it never had been seen till now. Cold bars were broken down, partitions rent, His faith emancipated from all doubt, And like the moon at sunrise, hope grew wan Through nearness to the world which it had sought, And by that nearness superseded now. The wildness of his present solitude Touched him, and with its royal touch set free His thoughts, his habits; nay, his penitence Became another thing from what it was. The lashing surge, the hollow thundering voice Spake like a pontiff who had power to annul His excommunication: and forth with His spirit was uplifted by the sea, And his whole being shared the enfranchisement Of its wild scenery: grandeur around him Begot an inward grandeur whence he dared To deal more boldly with himself; the joy, Which tried its half-fledged wings in Troutbeck Vale, And which he feared as being a joy too much, Now forth into transcending rapture burst. By day, by night, he looked from huge Black Combe; The solemn sea, the deep, the unenslaved, Rocking and roaring, angry or at rest, Was at his feet: a gush of glorious thoughts Rose like an unresisted tide within. Bursts of impassioned aspiration sprang From an impetuous strife to realize That which was most within him, which he felt To be a power of immortality, Wounded with beating at its prison bars, And now impatient grown to be uncaged. And as he felt the knocking more and more Of that mysterious instinct in his soul, His spirit rose, from off its ashes rose, Like Job of yore, and with a hardihood Which was an act of faith it was so bold, He turned the helm of his whole life at once; And with calm interval of confidence He listened the new music of his thoughts, Which louder sang, as when they give the ship More to the wind; then before God sank down In breathless worship, and that broken prayer Which the wrapt soul in such high hour may breathe. Thus in the Knight's declining age,âdecay Unfelt, though inwardly at work,âthe sea Delivered his imprisoned thoughts, and broke With oft recurring impulses the chain Of heavy grief about his spirit bound, A blessÃ¨d pupillage, but now fulfilled. For they who would confront the thought of death In that proximity with which the old Must meet its silent aspect, and would fain In unalarmed companionship therewith Walk onward to the tomb, must first have quelled All trivial hopes and fears, and by some shock Of inward grace or outward providence Have with intelligent solemnity Dethroned the world within them, and dissolved The meddling pageantry of visible things. Thus in a hymnlike strain of glorious power So spake the vocal Spirit of the Sea Within Sir Lancelot's heart, as those deep bells Of holy Advent, four times tolled, break forth On the calm peace of the declining year, Startling the soul perchance forgetful grown Of all its fearful fortunes yet to come, In the long train of less memorial feasts And nameless Sundays, while within the shrine The trumpet winds four several blasts of fear, Heard from the trembling corners of the world. For first the long terrific notice peals Of the tremendous Advent of the Judge; A second blast resounds to wake the soul To meet with lamp and oil at dead of night The Infant God, who is both Spouse and Judge: While the third trumpet sounds in sweeter strains Exhorting us in all our fears to find Fresh cause for exultation in our faith; Then the fourth trumpet, like the first one, dares Bold love! to bid the Judge come speedily. And thus those advent clarions wind their blasts, In thrilling admonitions, while the Church, With evening antiphons most like the sighs Of the old world before Messias came, Bids her majestic collects hand in hand Walk with her children, until Christmas Eve Dismisses the vibration from our ear, And the fair Church illumined from within, Her altars garnished for the midnight mass, On the benighted world around outpours Her gladsome witness of the Virgin-Born. And children sing that night unto the Babe, And Angels with them, scarce above their heads, Delight to swell the echoes of the hymn Into the tingling ear of starlit skies, And the four tolls of Advent are displaced By that nocturnal peal which shakes the towers, And keeps the Christian cities all awake, Between the midnight and the morning Mass. To one within close mountains always pent How blissful is the riot of the eye, When it expatiates o'er the desert sea With its exulting waters resonant, By nought except the white horizon fenced! Taught by thy lips, majestic Sea! how dread Seems the vast range of man's immortal hopes, By calm confessed more solemnly than storm, Time how unreal, and the cells of space How unendurable, infinity How possible, how near, yea, at her feet Imaged in thee! When from some cape the ear A livelong day hath listened to thy voice, A livelong day the eye insatiate fed Upon thy plains, in gleamy distance stretched, Grateful expanse, what wonder that the soul Should feel herself there winged with thoughts as strong As eagle's pinions, keen as eagle's eyes, Whether for upward soaring, by the sun Undazed and to his radiant vicinage By royal instincts drawn, or for descent, Stooping from some invisible altitude, Swift and unerring on their earthly prey? So wrought the vocal sea within his heart That he undid the yoke of Silence laid Upon his lips, the old ascetic fast From words, the wholesome abstinence assigned To raise the too light spirit, and sustain The heavenly tone of thought thereby acquired, As hunger on the body is imposed A scourge to quell the frankness of the flesh,â This first, but afterwards a means to gain A contemplation far above the heights The world-impeded soul can hope to reach. Thus to the obedient doth it ever come To find in self-denying ordinance A two-fold use, the undressing of the soul From its outworn attire, the purple robe Lent by the world in cruelty to mock Its high pretensions, and the investing it With the pure visions and abiding joys Of Neighborhood unto the Throne of God. O toil most difficult it is to tread Our Master's royal road of hungry Fast And aching Vigil, and a steep ascent Leads upward far to gain the starry heights Of Silence, when the host of vexing thoughts And low conceptions, into tumult stirred By all the incessant trouble of the tongue, Through such stern discipline is banished thence; And the tranquillity, thus hardly won, Restores unto the fallen soul again, In spirit found though locally withheld, The primal garden where the Almighty talked, Disdaining not man's feeble innocence. Methinks they deem but weakly of the height To which man's love of God may well aspire, Who in such deep observances and rules,â By generations of ascetic Saints, As needful found, invented and made over, The sacred science of the Canonized, To us poor bearers of the Crossâcan see Nought but a cold contemptuous neglect, And handling most disdainful, of the good And harmless creatures, and of God A slavish unaffectionate belief, And base opinion. Thou, dear Church of old! And thou no less, true Church of modern days! Canst testify the pure extatic love, The tender spirit, self-forgetting thought, The childlike adoration of thy Saints Following to martyrdom the Spotless Lamb, Their love of nature as the mirror calm Of Him, the merciful Creator, seen And recognized therein far more than now When boasting knowledge hath defiled the spring With its ignoble licence, which in pride Repudiates the blessing of the Church, And having bleared the eye of conscience, smites With barrenness the regions of the mind. Thou canst bear witness to the fervid zeal, Wherewith they vindicated this fair earth And the mute animals, as types beloved, From heresy profane: thou didst behold In them a love of Jesus unsurpassed, An ardency of transport best concealed Behind the curtain of a difficult tongue, Lest in the mind impure the words should breed Vilest similitudes of earthly love. O then if to our fancy aught should seem Among those reverend men uncouth or strained, 'Twere well to love the sweetly skilled device Of an affectionate jealousy, which puts Far from its presence, needlessly perchance,â So men will speak, but O to those who strive, However puny or remiss their toil, Most needful found, and of a holy life The lowest root and very topmost crown,â Such blameless joys as haply might beguile The singleness of their deep love to Christ:â A jealousy, by true self-knowledge taught That to be timorous with outward things Is wisdom, for the moral world within The shadow is of outward circumstance, As utterly as outward seemings are By the inward mind created and controlled. Yet better far, so living as we do, In softness and an anxious disesteem Of unseen things, and homage of base wealthâ O better far if so we could mistrust Ourselves, and nurse our hearts in humbling fear, Lest what we bear should be a mimic Cross, So all unlike the solemn burden borne By those who died for Christ in ancient days! But the stern yoke of Silence, self-imposed, Sir Lancelot now put from him: and the power, Which abstinence confers upon the use Of daily blessings, heightened to a joy The common gift of vocal utterance. Prayer, sweet before, how much more sweet became, Winged on articulate words! and thanksgivings Flowed with a more abundant liberty, Through the resounding channels newly turned Of sacred language, which itself alone Is a perpetual sacrifice of song Unto the Eternal Word who gave at first,â In heaven long used before, or haply then A fresh creation for the sake of earth,â The gift of that sweet mystery to man. Glory and praise unto the Son be given, Himself the first, the most expressive Word, The Language of the Father, wherewith He Interpreteth Himself unto mankind By His Co-equal Son. Ah me! how pure, How few our words should be, and full of truth, Lest with a too light tongue and thoughtless mirth Or worldly usage frivolous and vile, We should profane this primitive liturgy, This voice by God mysteriously conferred On man, that there might never fail on earth The sound of rational and vocal praise! Sir Lancelot paced for hours upon the mount, And bent his memory to recall some words From the grave ritual of the Holy Church, Some turn of her wise language which might hang Its solemn fulness of petition still About his spirit, some sweet antiphon, Or notable inflexion of a chant, Which with a congruous music happily Embalms some aspiration of the heart Of Sion's king, the heart which hath absorbed All hearts within its own capacious range, And to mute feelings still in every age Hath been a spiritual tongue, the heart Which, after God's Own Heart select, doth now Beat like a spirit in the depths profound Of our humanity, and in the Church Seven times a day with cadence audible Times the sonorous voice of Christendom. Such fragments, as with effort he retrieved From the remembrance of old services, With measured recitation did he strew Upon the flowing wind and ample hill, Or upward sent into the blue concave Of starry nights. Oh! what a joy it was, Accompanied by many a sweet relief Of tears, and some keen reminiscences Brought from the past, the spur upon the rose Of his new-born delight! There is no sound In earth or sky one half so musical, One half so moving as man's voice, in prayer, In praise, in meditation clothed with words And uttered on the mountain-top, no sound Which can attain so near the Throne of God, Or so divine in its original. O not so sweet the noise of falling streams, Or voluntary of the jocund breeze Shaking its dewy wings in early morn, Or fingering visibly its instrument With changeful pressure of the keys, whene'er The sunshine ripples on the waving woods! Man's clear divided accents rise on high, Service of natural sound more pleasing far Than pastoral anthems breathed from off the moors By bleating flocks, which to the wandering bell Murmur responses, with a harmony Set off with strange expression by the voice, Uninterrupted, solitary, sent From some far field or wattled pen by one For blameless taint divided from its kind, And listened to with sympathetic awe, And with acclaim of beatings to console, Exhort, or cheer, responded to by those To whom the moorland's breezy range is free. And not, though it be prayer, so soft a plaint As man's, is that which rises round the farms, The grateful supplication of the herds, When on their placid features, gently bound In unexpressive calm, an instinct comes, An inward thought which moves them, on the grass Reclining at noon-day, to low as if They spoke to some invisible Presence nigh; A poor pathetic sound which, like the roar Of hungry lions, God accepts for prayer. And memory then so wrought with his intent, That in a few short weeks he had retrieved Whole portions of the Psalter, Collects brief Condensing truths with deep felicity, High-hearted antiphons, and woven words Of sweet responsories, by marvellous power Evoked from boyish reminiscences, And hymns, especially the soothing words, And grave acknowledgment of unseen foes, Wherewith the Compline cheers us, when we seek Our nightly sepulchre for such soft sleep As must be scanty if it would be pure. So with quick psalms and swift-winged litanies, Whose reverent speed precluded wandering thoughts, Seven times a day his soul was raised on high, Raised to the liberty of cheerful hopes, And snatched from those wild humors of dismay, That strange disrelish of industrious prayer, That causeless inward fainting of good thoughts, And that vague perturbation of the mind, Wherewith the demons will dispirit him Who, for Christ's sake or for self-punishment, Confronts the visions of a lonely life, Its chilling aspect, and the cheerless voice Of solitude, deep in the conscience heard. Yea thus the demons, whose own proper realm The anchoret invades, dispirit him With thoughts, with apparitions, frightening sounds, And brutal contacts, and wild glaring lights, And imitations of celestial forms, Till he sheds vexed and unrefreshing tears, And like a dusty wrestler, bruised and faint, Comes forth a vanquished victor from the strife. But highest privilege, with fervent thanks Acknowledged, was the power once more to breathe On the still night or fluent air of day The Name of Jesus, of all mortal words Dearest and best, with sacred riches fraught Of meditation, and an endless store Of spiritual meanings, which distil With slow and silent dropping in our hearts, Most like the sweet exudings of a tree From out whose creviced rind the honeycombs In the warm sunshine trickle. Tuneful Name, Too common made by sinful lips which use Their Christian rights more boldly than beseems Their worth, inheriting unconsciously From past sin, ill repented of, a quick Self-trusting temper, and unbridled tongue By reverence unchastised! The humble Knight, Tutored in nature's school, with sparing use Yet with enjoyment into transport raised, By sacred awe more keenly edged, would mix The BlessÃ¨d Name with his soliloquies; And, solaced thus and sweetly dignified, His hours of lonely converse now became Enjoyment such as he had never dreamed Might to his wounded conscience be vouchsafed. Of all our catholic rights, a marvellous store And numberless, is none more sweet than that By which we can console our grief, or else Our love of Jesus gratify, or win With diligent lips indulgence for our souls, Or for the souls in penal fires detained, The privileged iteration of that Name. Yet never was that royal word pronounced Without obeisance duly interposed With an affectionate scruple; when alone, A homage is it to the Saviour paid As present, with a sense that Angels nigh Were bending as that Name escaped his lips; And in the throng of social intercourse That gesture, in the Written Word ordained, Witness may be unto oblivious eyes, And gentle check restraining giddy tongues. Alas! how very far remote are we, Whose Christian freedom with our growing sins Grows in proportion, while our sense of sin Becomes obtuse,âhow far remote are we From that deep meditative heart of love, Which on our lowest privileges set A price more precious than we deign to put Upon our highest,âfrom the mind remote Wherein the Church an annual feast ordained In honor of that simple-sounding Word, The Name of Jesus, feast of fervid hearts, Like Bernard's, or like Bernardine's, which glow With sweet intolerable fires within, While all without is winter's frost and sleet. Nor wanted he another liberty From which he had endeavoured to refrain, Unwisely as self-guided men are wont, A holy practice which he now renewed, At first through impulse he could not control. For self-invented penance has no balm, But irritates the wound it fain would heal. When he had left the Ash-tree Hermitage, And in the storm had crossed the distant hills, Rounding the cornice upon Walney Scar Entangled in a fringe of lucid mist, He turned the invidious eminence which stops The prospect southward; suddenly, the cloud Uplifting at that moment, down the vale, As through a telescope, he saw the sea, Angry and purple, far and wide outspread In stormy grandeur: with the sight there rushed A torrent of old memories then let loose, As from a dungeon, by the glorious view. Unto the ground he sank upon his knees And, trembling, signed the Cross upon his breast, For years unworn upon that guilty heart. He knelt in trouble and he rose in peace; So tranquilly the admonition wrought! And now with reverent licence did he seek The aid that Sign unto his soul supplied. Both when he knelt and when he rose from prayer, And when a thought more touching than was wont Flashed o'er his mind, or sight more beautiful Than common greeted him, he bowed and signed With love and awe the Cross upon his breast, Partly in ritual acknowledgment Of that invisible Presence where he stood, Partly in admonition to himself By outward symbol made more forcible, And partly in the faith that Heaven so loves The blessÃ¨d Sign, that meditated wrath Allows herself to be thereby disarmed, And Angels come more promptly to our aid, While evil powers behold and, shuddering, fly. O blessÃ¨d Sign! which from my youth hath been (Prompted by inward want, by books untaught, Nor from example copied) my true shield Against the invasion of unholy fears Troubling my nights too populous with dreams From thoughts by day too wildly overwrought; Dear Sign! which hath in later years full oft Repaired the mirror of eternal things Within my heart, by angry mood displaced Or by profane conceptions broken up, How hast thou been to me memorial calm Of my New Birth, a fence between my soul And the dark world, a benediction felt As the mute pressure of the Saviour's Hand, Assuring timid love with healing touch, Exorcist too of demons which beset The Christian in his loneliness! May shame Of my dear Master's Cross ne'er teach my heart That unimpassioned lore, which would extol The cold formalities of barren mind Above the tender spirit of the Faith, From which these pensive rituals are evoked! O sweet Theology of nature! thou Dost the poetic sense inform and feed With beautiful bright symbols, round us strewn In sibylline confusion, whence we may By diligence a Christian cypher make, Piecing the brilliant fragments one by one Through guess or intuition, till we read The mystic truths of Heaven in obvious type Illuminated on the scroll of earth. Attractive Scholarship! thy first essay, Thine earliest task is o'er the blessÃ¨d Cross, In nature's alphabet the letter chief, Most often found. With what an eye of love Did they of old that sacred Sign detect Among the boughs, and in the crossing clouds, And o'er the plains, and on the skins of beasts, And in the cloven roots by ploughs upturned! The gentle birds before the daylight eye Of the blue heaven outstretch their little wings, And, while they make the Cross, are safely borne Through the thin ether, but if they should mar That Sign with pinions closed, they fall to earth. He, who on shipboard ventures, gladly finds (Once hath it been a needful aid to me!) The mast a Cross, and when they spread the sail, A Body hangs thereon which doth propel The labouring vessel; and the voyage becomes An admonition typical, the ship Figuring the Church, the chafing sea the World, The Body, dimly seen upon the Cross Through the dark air and frequent drifting spray, With no inapt similitude shows Him, Whose Presence is the haven of our lives; The lifting up of whose Immaculate Hands,â Outstretched upon that cruel Tree of Life, In the prophetic evening of the world, Whose tardy twilight lingers round us still,â Was the sweet Vesper Sacrifice foretold, And for long ages sung in Hebrew psalm, Chanted within the expectant Synagogue. Another change too had his outward life Wrought imperceptibly within, a change Not without import to the man who seeks Admittance by whatever road he may Into the world of spirit. As the sea Had snapped the fetters of his mind, and thrown The habit of his thoughts beyond the range Of this terrestrial scene, so through his sleep The silent night distilled that liberty Into his dreams, which close relation bore To his new circumstances; for erewhile In liveliest apparitions had the past Been nightly unimprisoned, and his soul With darkest inundation of old sins Insufferably possessed; but now his dreams Knocked softly at the portals of the grave, And entrance won, and through the livelong night Ranged in the misty space that lies beyond, And, home returning as the stars grew pale, Had gathered truths which even his waking hours Could recognize as holy and divine. What though our dreams, which I may boldly call One branch of human knowledge, yet elude The form of shapely science, still shall we, Through disesteem of universal faith, Or doubt for wisdom taking, or a wish To guard the frontiers of our barren sense Against the encroachments of the world unseen,â Shall we, who so much need them, disregard Chance revelations to the spirit made Through God's once chosen instrument, outpoured By Angels through the conduits of sleep In silent-stirring pictures, or sometimes With an aerial music wheeling by, Akin to sound but something far more sweet And distant? If it be allowed to man To look upon his own immortal soul, Next to the vision of his God the sight Most coveted, it can alone be given In the clear spectral twilight of a dream. And in the bosom of this cheerless age, If we would duly estimate the skill, Wherewith these rites and strong persuasions built The Individual Mind, and gave a tone Through that unto the Social State, not vain Will be the admonition that such things Unto the spirit of those times were not Romantic speculations, as to us, Wherewith imagination plays, and thought Herself bewitches for a few sweet hours From false conventions and the littleness Of act and feeling, equalized too much Beneath the social tyranny which now, An intellectual feudalism, defeats Great purposes through coward love of peace, Dispiriting the hearts which would retrieve Our civil grandeurs lost, or re-cement, In all the breadth of its harmonious life, Sovereign and subjugate at once in things Terrene, the spiritual commonwealth Of Holy Church. Among those ancient men These faiths were entertained as moral powers, Were solemnized in daily acts, the moulds Wherein their lives were cast, and which achieved, With mightiest effort in unlooked-for ways, The freedom of the Individual Mind, The choicest of all social gifts, and source Of all political magnificence. Yet if the mountain-top and boundless sea To his enfranchisement of spirit gave Somewhat of wildness, the dark vicinage Of his rude cell had sights and sounds enough To mellow and subdue, and to reclaim Thoughts which might haply wing their flight too far. There oft he sat, with many a sombre fold Of weeping cloud pavilioned, while his mind By the pale melancholy light inspired, Drew mournful morals out of little things. There, couched on high among the nodding ferns, He dimly traced the curse of Adam's Fall Ubiquitous, which won its silent way Into the kingdoms of inanimate life, As here and there a plant, beneath a law Of beautiful arrangement made, transgressed, And, with its nature breaking covenant, Swerved from its sweet propriety of shape, And putting forth unwonted powers in search Of freedom, missed of beauty, and became A thing deformed; yet ah! not like poor man Transmitting an hereditary flaw, But in its own sin dying on the hill. And on his hermitage had curious chance (For so we name such acts of Heaven as hide The order and connection of their law) Bestowed an awful faculty to train And discipline his mind in fear; as earth Through providential accident full oft Thus ministers unto the soul of man. There is a cheerless glen outside the walls Of old Jerusalem, a dark ravine, Not by the action of the torrent scooped, But in some throe of earth a fracture rent, The gloomy vale of Josaphat, a place Where Christian legend and wild Arab faith With old tradition, drawn from Hebrew source, Strangely concur to fix the solemn scene Of the Last Judgment. There on Olivet, Even where He wept and prayed, and bore the curse Of all our generations, Christ shall sit, While through the dusky strait before His Eye The spirits, in their bodies newly clothed, Shall defile one by one. O kindly faith! O beautiful belief! which so could fix The last and hardly tolerable woe Of our humanity in that dim vale, Where mother earth with venturous love might hope To breathe sweet admonitions to our Lord Of the pure Flesh which He vouchsafes to wear, And, with allowed constraint, might so inspire The Saviour to prevail against the Judge. And still more touching fitness will appear In this tradition, if we bear in mind That on the selfsame mount the Master sat, While Judas bargained with the wicked priests, On the fourth evening of the Holy Week, With Four selected from His chosen Twelve; And spake of Sion's fall in words that seemed To overshoot their end, and covertly The shadow with the substance to confuse, Till the Last Judgment rose in His discourse, With awful plainness; then did He once more The kind relieving veil of figure throw Over the aspect of figure throw And of the Virgins spake who went to buy Oil for their lamps at midnightâah! too lateâ And of the Talents left with Jew and Greek By Him, who with ascending travel sought With His true Flesh the far-off land of Heaven, Present as God,âand of the Corporal Works Of Mercy done by those who shall discern Through faith their Lord vouchsafing to the End To suffer and be needy in the Poor. Haply, with these localities around, If there we must confront the searching Day, The reminiscence of the Passion might, Even in the awful business of that Pomp, Stir on the infinite Abyss of Love, As the soft breaths which flutter o'er the sea Rivet the azure calm more sweetly there. The fissure of Black Combe, wherein the Knight Had built his little hermitage, appeared In its rude details strangely similar To that prophetic vale of Josaphat. There nightly from his window would he lean And look into the chasm wherein the moon Troubled the darkness, but dispelled it not: And by the hour his trembling soul would face The Vision of the Judgment, till serene, Yet not without alarm which faith as oft Controlled, he could contemplate that array, Pictured as to his memory it might be In that most gloomy gorge by Sion's wall. So had he gazed full often from his tent, Pitched on the dusty slope of Olivet Over against the tombs of Judah's kings; Where through the darkness the sepulchral stones Floated, white ghastly motes, in glimmering light; And the slant moonbeams thrown into the glen, Just faintly silvering o'er some crisp-leaved dome Of mastic, vainly strove to penetrate The murky bosom of the deep ravine; And the gaunt olive-roots, which forced aside The fretted head-stones, seemed like crawling beasts, In hideous volume coiled upon the earth, Feeding by moonlight on the lately dead; While the dim vale was fathomed by the eye Through aid of one broad hoary seam which ran, Most like a throbbing vein of tremulous light, Along the raven gloom,âthe channel dry Of yellow Cedron, trickling underground. Thus while the sea by day could harmonize His thoughts, to tranquil meditation given Upon eternal things, the cleft by night Exhibited that grave Solemnity, Mutely delineated on the spot, The very thought of which can purify The thronged imagination, and rebuke The sin which to its presence may intrude. Thus life, the past, was wholly put away, And thrust behind the more engrossing thoughts That drew him forward to the misty breadth Of prospect, which the near approach of death And the grave's portals, on their silent hinge Half turned already to the prescient eye, Disclose unto the Christian soul, informed With some faint knowledge of the secret things And region of vast truths, which lies beyond And in its measure may be travelled now;â Travelled with escort of unworldly thoughts, Through rites with an adoring faith performed, And by the clue from ancient days consigned In Creeds, recited not without some stir, Felt in high Heaven where Angels offer up The choral liturgies of Mother Church, And simple cottage prayers no less, complete With the rich incense of His Merits, who Travelled erewhile in three short solar days The passages beyond the gates of death, And doubtless left such mystic footprints there As shall transcend the office of a sun, Where neither sun nor moon are free to shine, To be by us discovered as we go Inevitable voyagers that way. And finally, as if to close the scene Of that harmonious discipline, wherewith The Seaside Mountain and its neighbourhood Had furthered, and, as best it could, filled up The education of his soul, there came A vision of symbolical intent, And yet a simple pomp of natural sights, To him accorded in the open fields. North of the bay of Ravenglass the shore, A champaign hitherto, begins to swell Into blythe slopes of cultivated land. There in a spacious field he sat, where kine, Spotting the grass in social couples, grazed, While he beneath a stunted oak, which leaned To give the sea-breeze passage o'er its crown, Stooping to save its boughs, a shelter found. The day was one of almost breathless heat, With unrefreshing rain-showers interspersed, And fogs from off the sultry ocean lay Upon the hills and plain, that seemed to shake In the white haze-fires dancing o'er the scene In spiral columns, while upon the west There hung a cloud of dusky violet hue With the live lightnings tremulously edged. Yet was the body of the mighty cloud Soft as a cygnet's plumage, whence there came Low thunders, fired like distant minute-guns Below the horizon and far-off at sea. Then on the heated plain, which intervenes Between the mountains and the deep, there passed A singular mirage, pompously and slow. With an uneasy heaving there appeared A river huge, with glossy waters filled; Far off it stretched into the woods, and bore Reflected on its face the silent trees With exquisite fidelity, and then To a vast lake expanded, and consumed The solid plain and laved the mountain's base. Forthwith the mighty ridge, parting like ships That swing upon their anchors, opened out Into bright straits whereby the shining lake Made islands of the summits that were left. And in the midst, seated upon the breast Of the clear waters, as the travellers tell Of Mexico, a city now uprose, Built of a dull red stone, with tower and spire And battlemented gate, and most of all Innumerous windmills fanning the warm air. Then with the impulse of a whispering breezeâ By such a fragile tenure do we hold All beautiful appearances on earthâ The pageant rocked, and into pieces fell, Ruin grotesque! and stately visions shrank Till they were recognized for objects tame, From the broad landscape singled by the mist For such transfiguration. Thus am I, With patience never weary of the fraud, Daily deluded by three cones of rock Bearing aerial domes of vocal pine, At blue Winander's head, and from my hill The vivid silver of the lake beyond Dazzles the sight, and cleaves the triple rocks To separate islands, which upon the mere Swim indistinctly and in motion seem, Even as the Euganean hills descried Floating like pyramids of misty blue, By one who from his gondola at noon Hard by the Lido looks across the sea. But now unto the meditative Knight, The apparition pondering, it appeared No less than a mute prophecy of death, On nature's part a visible shadowing forth Of that transfiguring of earthly things Caused by the light upon a death-bed streamed From out eternity. Sweet type it was Of that most beautiful apparel, veils Clearing not hiding, which in time to come The sacred knowledge of a future state Shall over all the naked memories throw Of this our mortal life, so ill discerned In its most proper loveliness by us Blindfold through our transgressions, and so led By angel guides about the Promised Land, Dwelling therein although we know it not, Feeling the grapes of Escol, hearing sounds As of the blessÃ¨d Jordan flowing by, But all as dark blind men, bewildered rather Than by great truths, so dimly taught, informed. Such was the nurture which Sir Lancelot drew From his imprisoning and secluded Vale And the free Mountain-top, while Loneliness Held him, an unweaned infant, at her breast. Tyrant, and Tempter, Mother and Nurse austere, Fulfilling manifold functions to us men, How shall I name thee, mighty Solitude? Person or Thing, a Presence, Place, or Life, Invisible Life environing our souls? Silent or Sounding? vacant, bare, and waste, Or populous with motley, turbid shapes? I know not if I love or loathe thy touch; And while I daily grow thine intimate, The more I converse with thy power, the less Can I discern thy nature, but detect Thy changeful Aspects ever multiplied, Charms that repel and horrors that allure; So that to gaze upon thy desert fields Quickens such perilous impulses within, As might most apt yet faintest figure find In the wild fascination which disturbs The thoughts of one on airy steeple fixed, Or leaning verge of windy precipice, Only that thou canst tempt us to a fall Involving worse mishap than mangled limbs,â Irreparable mischief to the soul! One while I deem thee a close prudent power That husbandeth my spirit's inward strength: Another while thou art a preying fire, Or fiery, wasteful, intermitting wind Which dissipates ascetic wealth, acquired Through difficult ordinance cheerfully performed, And to my strife-worn temper thou dost prompt A languid introversion of my thoughts, Most cruel devastation of the heart. One while thou art a fierce iconoclast, And then a builder up, transmuting so Thine offices that we may well proclaim One only truth about thee sure and safe,â That without clear vocation from on high No Christian man may join his hand in thine, Save for brief respite from the sinful world, And only thus when in the vicinage Of Church, and Priest, and ready Sacraments, And that deep harbour, the Confessional. Therefore I name thee neither Place, nor Thing, Nor Presence (for thou canst not be withdrawn) Nor Person (for it were too bold a word, A title wholly sacred and divine When that which bears it is not localized), But thou art rather a created Life, A life without a nature of thine own, A Capability of good or ill, Thirsty, insatiate, limitless, profound;â A Living Vase with an indwelling Power Of dark possession or angelic strength, Whose keen pervasive thrills find speedy road Through Conscience, Intellect, and wayward Will, Not without physical disturbance felt In Contests, Sins, and Graces mystical. Thou hast a Voice, an Eye, an Ear, a Hand, Which have by shrinking men been realized. Thou hast a VoiceâO would that we could fear, More than we do, all sounds and silent things, Which breed a wholesome dread of powers unseen!â Thou hast a Voice, which in the depth of night, Or in the utter loneliness of noon, A tingling concourse of innumerous sounds, Speaks to the conscience as a priest might speak, Whose words we honour yet will not obey. An Eye thou hast, which can expression give To the dumb features of the earth and sky, Or ordinary chance of daily acts, Piercing, reproachful, terrible, to those Who have at heart a secret weight of sin, Or sinful details lingering unconfessed. And silent darkness is thine open Ear, Greedy to drink the secrets of the soul, And prowling near like some nocturnal spy; And therein, seeking in its uttered words Foolish relief, unguarded conscience tells Sins better trusted to a pitying priest. A Hand thou hast, which thou canst lay on those Who in the tumult of the world forget Duty and Self, their Neighbour and their God,â A Hand so crushing cheerfulness within, And overlaying animal spirits so, That underneath its pressure we may deem Ourselves already at the Judgment Bar. O mutable and double-featured Power! Silent thou art and sounding, both at once: When thou art still and seemingly inert, Thou art the Quiver where the demons keep Their loathsome shafts; and, when all resonant To man's enlivened conscience, thou canst be The Trumpet of God's Presence in the Soul! BOOK VII. THE LEPROSY. In waking vision, through the fear of death Engendered or the imposing calm of night, What time the lively heavens were set with stars, And the imperfect moon had sunk, I saw Humanity, the multitudinous tribes Of mortal men upon the hilly waste, The spirit-peopled desert of the world, Pining in obstinate sullenness apart, Or in a fretful wandering seeking rest Not unsuccessfully, and half consoled Even by an irritable eloquence Quick to disprove whatever hope might prompt. And couched around them, as it were a ring Of lions keeping guard, were marvellous Forms; Some lay supine, and might be deemed asleep But for the mobile gesture of their eyes, While others ever and anon arose, And pacing restlessly about in search Of something which they found not, came again Where they had couched before, and other some Went in and out with noiseless step and swift Among the quiet sentinels, and gazed Upon the pallid stars, and seemed to move As though they read an obvious mandate there. Such scene it was as though in Arab wilds One came by night upon a caravan Of pilgrims bound for Mecca, with its groups Of sleepers scattered o'er the moonlit sands; And if it be the desert wind that stirs A garment here and there, or if it be The shudder that reveals some inward dream We know not;âthus those wondrous Creatures lay. No sound but their imperious breathing smote The listening ear; and with infectious thrill, Or like the soft continuous wake of wind, There ran full oft a quick and angry start This way and that across the voiceless herd, Most like the breaches which a fearful dream Makes in the slumber of a man now first At sea, or who the day before hath climbed A steep and ever seems to fall therefrom. Methought that by some tokens I perceived Those creatures were the impersonated shapes Of all the manifold sicknesses that prey On our sin-tainted flesh; and mid them all An Angel sat who made their wrath subserve His ministries of love; or I will say Of seeming love and mere eventual good, If it be more according to the mind Of Holy Church to deem the spirits, who wield Sickness and sorrow, instruments of ill Indulged in their base hatred of mankind, And for the proof of men; yet sweeter far, Sweeter, if lawful, the consoling hope That to our Guardian Angel's hand the scourge Hath been consigned; for, if terrestrial love When deepest is least backward to inflict Remedial pain, angelic hands might deal The unsparing blows, and it were sweet to lie So suffering, sweet for sinners to look back On sorrow with that tearful yearning love The memory of parental chastisement Breeds in our after years. But shall faith dread Even in Satan's hand to rest awhile? The tempter's touch is but an outward thing; And his repelled suggestions leave no stain But what a penitential psalm, rehearsed For love of Christ, may wholly cleanse away. The grasp of sickness, if it be his arm Which awfully encircles our poor limbs, May, while we shudder, be full well endured, In memory of that passage through the air When Christ vouchsafed to entrust His spotless Fleshâ O love by us so miserably paid!â To Satan's handling, while he bore the Lord Unto the temple roof. From out the crowd A white and voiceless creature, dull of eye And silent-footed, was that night detached, And on a direful ambassage sent forth To the lone summit of the huge Black Combe. There with envenomed kiss, as though it were The bodiless contact of the infected wind, And not a living spirit, it set a seal Upon Sir Lancelot's forehead as he slept. O Leprosy! in byegone days thou wert An awful presence mid the sons of men, A sign set up in merciful disdain To overawe the soul, the like whereof, A miracle to succour that weak faith Which needs the arm of sight, we now possess, Who, with deep self-reproach and muttered prayer, Shrink as we daily see the homeless Jews, A strange and cognizable people, cast Their preternatural shadows in our streets. But thou, dread Sickness! witness of the power, And faithful image too, of human sin, How art thou melted from among us, gone Like unabiding snow, we know not when! Earth hath a token less, and misseth thee Even as the Dead Sea shore did one day miss That single pillar of white salt that stood Looking towards Sodomâone unlawful wish Of base self-will most horribly fulfilled! This is no theme for song: the stricken man, At length the manifest victim of disease, Descending from his mountain, bent his steps To Calder Abbey; there, his name concealed, He sought the intercessions of the Church, Her potent rites, and the vicinity Of her great sacraments; for to his mind His sickness plainest admonition was Of God's compassionate will, that he should leave The nurture of his mountain solitude, And brace his soul mid Christian sights and sounds To suffer now, and for the end prepare, The end which he beheld was drawing nigh, Like a bright sunset following on a storm. Was never consolation so confused With awe-inspiring menace, or man's hopes So wedded to man's fears, as then In that old Liturgy of Lepers,ârite Fearfully beautiful, within whose forms, As in a piteous drama, were set forth The woful fortunes of our fallen race, Which yet we love because it is our own. O faithless world! thou growest weak and old! How hast thou sinnÃ¨d that the wrath of Heaven Should have withdrawn this presence from thy fields, This supernatural token of the power Of Adam's one contagious sin? And thou Dear Mother Church! with what affectionate rites Didst thou consign the tainted to their cells, Immured in dread tranquillity therein With God and their chastising Angel, there To evoke from penance those high gifts once found Within the Font, and in the heats of youth Bartered and lost through passion or mischance, In their first fulness nowhere found again! Haply the Angels, whose far-kenning sight Can trace the world through all its tortuous ways And its long discipline of ages, see How it hath ever been throughout all time, That what men deem improvement in the lot Of humankind is but a putting off Some power to be like Christ, the getting rid First of one Thorn and then another, so Despoiling and diminishing the Crown Which only gives the right to rule in Heaven. Where are the daily rudenesses of life, The imperfect satisfaction of our needs, The keen discomforts of our mortal state, The hardships which annealed the men of old, The sense of want which every hour brought home To sinful man? Are they not put aside, So far as may be, with unblest success, Thanks to officious science! as the lot Of monks and of poor men, kept at arm's length By all the effeminate appliances Of our luxurious skill? And we perchance Are either venturous or unwise, when we Regret the growing softness of the times, As being ourselves effeminate, afraid To give ourselves to God, or bravely dare The ancient measures of saint's love. Should we Without these comforts summon up the heart To do the little that we do for God, Or persevere in those few puny acts Which we esteem so great? What wonder then That if in purple and fine linen swathed, The world should play the part of Dives more And more each passing age, and less affect That Christ-like sorrow which the Angels seek To penetrate with their enamoured gaze, And, were they not so calm, might envy too Through wish to embrace the self-same life as Christ, And have their acts identified with His, The exclusive privilege of Catholic Saints,â What wonder if the jealous wrath of Heaven Should silently withdraw neglected ills, As slighted sacraments, which men no more Should have the liberty to scorn! The plague, Which recognized the sacred touch of kings, Vanished from earth when kingly hands were held Sacred no longer; for the world brooked not The presence of a supernatural thing; And so that token went, leaving the State Weakened, yet of its weakness unaware, Proud of the open sea, and grand career, And with the sunshine drunk, yet full of taunts Gainst Peter's bark that had convoyed it there. Ah! silly kings will learn, but learn like kings, Too late to profit by the lesson taught, That churchless states obey not royal helms, And that St. Peter's keys were light as air Compared with Revolution's heavy hand. O Sovereign People! whither wilt thou steer These old historic states of Christendom? Hast thou a chart, are soundings ascertained, Did ever true discoverer report Safe harbours o'er that wild and stormy sea? Or shall we one day, drifting on our wreck, Despondingly believe what some have said, Which would be almost madness were it true,â The world's improvemÃ©nt is the Christian's loss? So long then as the favoured earth possessed One Corporal Work of Mercy more than now, The tending of the Lepers, Holy Church, Mindful how oft our Saviour had vouchsafed To appear in leprous guise unto the Saints, Drew into one her most consoling acts, With bland denunciations intermixed. She took the Leper from the affrighted world, Sprinkled her holy water on his brow, Entitling him dear Victim of our God, And gifted him with Gloves, with Knife, with Lamp, Trumpet to hold communion with his kind, Pannier for alms, and Pitcher for the wells, Symbolic gifts whose meaning could sustain A patient temper; thence unto his cell, The abbey cross borne to the threshold first, Was he consigned with prayer, and so exiled From that false world whose joys delude the soul, At Easter only suffered to emerge, For not the tombs that day could keep their dead. And for some ages when the Leper died, So solemn was the love men bore to him And almost reverence for his mystic woe, That Mass was chanted for him in the Church (By after Councils solemnly refused) As for a true Confessor of the Faith, And witness of some supernatural thing. Thus, in symbolic vestments all arrayed, Within a cell Sir Lancelot was immured What time, the chanted compline o'er, the star Of peaceful eve with uncontested right Vicegerent was for her still absent queen, And with the help of lingering sunset shed A dusky brightness o'er the dewy woods. How beautiful that night was Calder Vale! The golden moon with shadowy splendor lent A depth of mottled foliage to the boughs Still leafless, and the abbey's leaden roofs In the soft flashing beams were multiplied An hundredfold, and on the shining meads The whiteness of the frosty grass appeared A portion of the moonlight, while the stream, With its occasional broken water lit With an uncertain scattered brightness, dived Through the dark grove like an irregular band Of men with lanterns in a midnight wood, Threading their way together or dispersed. O Moon! thy light is like the honied tongue Of one who tells false parables to gild Or prompt a dubious act: when morning comes How changed will all that sunken vale appear! There is no image of unbroken peace Which is not gathered now around the spot Where so much suffering dwells, so much disease Of mind, and labour of remorseful thoughts Within that penitential House; and yet Misdeem not thou the quiet beauty shed Upon this stern abode; for it is not A mockery of nature, but sets forth In parables to disobedient man How lovely are the ancient offices Which these obedient elements fulfil,â How sweet the travail of unbroken laws, Thus imaging that pure tranquillity, Which reigns where'er the Will of God is done. The beasts, whose shadows, indistinct and dark, Spot yon illumined field, lie down in peace, If lower, yet more perfect than the peace Which man attains: for instinct unto them Is a deep law that hath more promptitude To act, than reason which is ever set 'Twixt doubtful contraries; so unto man Hath God, beside his reason, deigned to give The instinct of obedience, and for this With merciful acceptance He vouchsafes To take, what it is misery to withhold, The intelligent surrender of our wills And ways to His. In many a secret cell Within that convent doubtless may reside A man, whose wrecked and shattered life is cast On this seclusion after thoughtless years Of worshipping self-will, who, haply freed From the more heinous acts of mortal sin, Hath so disturbed his inward faculties, That when grace found him, and he turned to seek The oracles of conscience, no response Came from the desecrated shrine; his soul, Eyeless and voiceless both, was overcome With that intoxication which ensues On long self-worship, and within his heart Mercy must intervene to plant afresh The finer sense of right and wrong. Ah me! What a blind fight is life to such a man! Hating to be alone, yet every day Plunging more deeply into solitude, By frequent transit into separate spheres Of action self-imposed; craving too much For sympathy, yet ever out at sea, Where they who labour at appointed tasks At best can give him but a distant hail; Accumulating knowledge so disjoined From honest practice, that it soon becomes A load that overwhelms his cheerfulness; Toiling without a blessing through neglect Of those less lofty toils which God ordained; Too covetous of home, yet finding none For his unfixed affections. Wretched man! His very nature is a law which blights The face of home, and yet he knows it not. How is he like the sea-birds that by night Sleep on the dull dark ocean, and by day, Float on the sunny billows, and they see Where'er they go the self-same images, The sun's white glory far within the deep, And the blue vale of water 'twixt the waves, Ever the same, yet ever changed; no mark, No sign whereon to fix a local love, No home to be remembered for its peace, No shapely bough well known and best beloved Within the crowded forest. Hence it is They carol not, but wail from off the deep, In piteous accents of impatient grief, And some, like spirits hardened by despair, Joy in the savage tempest;âso with himâ The home, which he so fretfully pursues, Glides from beneath him, and he sinks at last Beneath the direst burden man can bear, That constant uniformity of change, Wherein consists the worship of Self-Will. This moonlit earth is not the earth which man Tills from the dawn unto the setting sun: And neither is the moonlit world of joy, Feasting, and poetry, the real world Where man achieves or misses of his crown. There is a second world behind the veil, More nigh to God, a more mysterious place, More thickly peopled with great deeds, more full Of spiritual Presences,âthe world Of sorrow, sickness, and of secret grief, Where life, ejected from the outward throng, Dwells in the quiet vestibule of death. Look at yon summer city on the shore Of that Italian lake; the moon is up, And, mingling strangely with her quiet beams, The incessant lightning of the voiceless clouds Clothes with white fire the hills and tremulous lake. And there is music on the quay, and sounds Of singers on the water far away; And youth is moving gaily on the banks, Where age is sitting and appears to have A deeper-seated joy, and in the port The lights from out the open windows cast Thin pillared shadows in the rippling deep, And barks with gaudy flags shoot up and down; And the cool freedom of the night appears To be sufficient of itself to cause This universal mirth; and mid it all, The song, the movement, and the shooting barks, And the pale lightning flapping o'er the hills, How silent stands yon solemn mountain tower Behind the city, borrowing from the moon Darkness, not light, and frowning on the scene As though it were a monitory thing Appointed to restrain men's thoughts. And yet Behind the face of this enjoyment lurks Another world, which teaches us that life Is not the dream of one short summer-night Mid the moon's visionary landscapes; no! Death is in the city, sickness, and sin, Suffering, remorse, despair, the unheeded priest. Haply the unknown passage of a soul Is being accomplished at this hour, for oft Amid the multitudinous poor death comes And finds his victims lonely; want, neglect, And hunger, being their only retinue: With these stern nurses round them they confront Their last great act, as utterly alone As the sick beasts that lay them down to die Beneath the pressure of their Maker's Will, In the deep noon mid Afric's sunless woods, Or the damp lairs of Asiatic caves. Sickness and Death! Ye twin beneficent Powers! I in the freshness of my youth am bold To hail you as benignant spirits ordained To lead my soul to Heaven! Ye do I hail Ere ye have come, and practising my thoughts, As best I may, to look you in the face, Aye, to confront your dreadest aspect, still Would I implore with trembling self-distrust, Won from preceding falls, the gracious Aid, That in your actual presence can bestow A manly peace, which shall not make ashamed This hardihood of words. For manifold And dire, O Sickness! are the crucibles, Wherein thy torturing alchemy essays The spirit of man; and they who sought for gold In molten stones, vain mortals! reaped a field Hardly more profitless, great Power! than thine. Now there are sicknesses which in a day, And with our bodily strength all unimpaired And love of life unquenched, would have us greet Death, as we would an unexpected guest; These are too fierce. Then there are slow, slow fires Which burn the patience of a man, and dry His prayers, and give him no vicissitude Of suffering, wearing off that novelty Which made him feel disease a sacred thing; These the Saints have. And other ills there are, Winning no sympathy, as not believed, Lurking like serpents in some secret place Within the body, stinging out of reach; And these are fearful: for complaint is met With chilling admonition, or received With that half credence which is worse to bear, And patience undergoes the martyrdom Of passing for impatience. O 'tis meet That they who tend the sick should have more faith In them, than in the art which ill conceals Its little power o'er man's mysterious frame! And, with the rest, there are some sicknesses Which are the obvious consequence of sin; Vain scourges do they seem, which are by most With a hard heathen manliness endured, Whose strength is in false pride that would prefer To reap the harvest it hath sown itself, Than suffer by the simple Will of God. And, lastly, in that there are stubborn men To whom indignity is ten times worse Than torment, there are other sicknesses, Which shame the sufferers; these are hard to bear, And they fall chiefly on the proud. But all Have one beneficent unity, one source Deep in the fountain of God's love, and preach One soothing doctrine to the docile heart:â Sufferings are Gifts, a Judgment is a Grace, As short of that One Judgment which alone Tries not, and purges not, but only seals! And Thee, most mortal of all mortal things, Thee would I hail, O Death! as being the gate Which I in search of Heaven shall enter. Thou, The commonest of daily acts, art not Common to each, but happenest only once. Thou wert a tyrant, for weak nature knew No means to bring thine overwhelming power Within the grasp of habit, and she wept For want of that poor knowledge how to die. This science hath been granted to her tears: From meanest self-denials we extract A power beyond the compass of thy strength; For faith dies daily with her Lord, and so By this sweet mystery art thou now dethroned. O men! we are but actors all our lives; We must be real once, even at the hour When we lie down to die, and is not this A consolation, while the light it sheds Unteaches us the love of self-deceit? All hail, Ye Kindred Powers! Pass on, pass on Across Time's bounded realm, to do a work More lasting than yourselves, to sanctify The Elect of God! And Thou, O Tyrant Time, Art Thou not weary, Despot! flapping thus Thy unwieldy wings across the suffering world, Like a huge land-bird lost upon the ocean; For such the Endless Ages are to Thee? What though Thou rollest o'er the tribes of men Most like a hurrying storm, the Angel waits Who knows thy sentence and hath learned the words By heart, and thy tremendous frame can cast No shadow on the Infinite Mind of God, Nor yet impair the least of His Decrees. Such are our tyrants, Fellow Men! and such Our ancient gods. O let us claim the rights Of that celestial servitude which makes These powers our daily vassals; let us choose That perfect liberty which none enjoy, But those whose will is with the Will of God, And is, through Faith and Hope, enthralled by Love! Such were the Presences and Powers that filled That world, amid whose shadowy regions now Sir Lancelot passed, a peopled loneliness, Peopled yet not with men, as earth might seem To outcast Cain, but conscious to himself Of sweet alliances that hopeless man Knew not; yet even to the hermit Knight There was a deepening of his solitude, Which he encountered not without alarm. Truly there is a mute companionship Between our animal strength and living soul, Which, like the intercourse a lonely man Oft seeks with some inferior creature, serves More ends than we opine, until disease Hath parted them, and drained the subsidy Of cheerful spirits which from our bodily power Flow in upon the mind. In Troutbeck Vale, And on the misty summit of Black Combe, The features of the open solitude had grown Familiar to him; yet he now perceived That in imprisonment, the narrowed range Of sense and motion, and the broken trust In his own strength, there was a loneliness, Which, till it hath begun to sanctify, Is terrible oppression. Ah! how great To one who bears impatiently the load Of his unuttered thoughts, his privacy Beyond the active circles of the world, Like an untravelled frontier, placedâhow great The consolation, and the inward strength How wonderful, which he in secret draws From deep reflection on the lonely Life Our Lord vouchsafed to lead! If he be rich, And hath with bootless envy oft desired That poverty ennobled by the choice Of God Himself,âif he be strong in health, And, further than the common griefs of life, Lacks sorrow which might make him like his Lord,â If the world love him, praise him, and he pines For outward chastisement to certify His heavenly sonship,âlet him be alone, Let him be solitary, not from choice, The baseness of a lettered ease, or wish To abstract himself from that unequal strife In which the bad keep down the good,âand there The Saviour's Life is imaged on his own. There is his Cross, a burden sanctified With special and exact endurance, there A treasure of perfection, which the Saints, Cast on the social happiness of life, Might envy, for its silence and its pains. How lonely was the Infancy of Christ, Beset by thoughts which rose into a sphere Beyond the reach of mortal sympathy, And burdened with the foresight of the Cross, And vision of that whole amount of sin Whose price He came to pay! How lonely too His untold Youth in Joseph's humble house, And sordid occupations! And His Life, Beginning in the desert with the dark And fallen angel for companion, seems More and more lonely still, because He knew What was in man, and trusted not Himself. So that the true Creator of the world, Environed with the obscurity of flesh, (O that a leper such as I should dare To speak the words!) moved on the earth He made A Homeless Pilgrim mid the countless homes Of men, and lairs of beasts, and nests of birds, And rooted flowers which He Himself had clothed,â Moved on the earth as excommunicate From His own sweet creation, for the love He bore to us, and to a low estate! Amid His Twelve was one betrayer found, Another to deny Him, and the rest To flee His hour of need, and on the Cross, While Mary's presence added to His grief More than it soothed, His utter loneliness Reached its unspeakable accomplishment, When from the depths of anguish He complained, That He, who was erewhile disowned of man, Was left of God! and bowing then His Head To that reluctant foe, which had withheld Its hand through agonies enough to quench Another's life long since, He gave consent, And Death, most awful thought! drew nigh the Cross, And smote, last act of power! the Son of God. And through His desolate Life we must believe, And His protracted Passion most of all, That to His Human Nature the Divine Auxiliar proved, to lessen not the weight Of untold griefs, but as a prop to give To human flesh a superhuman power To suffer, and to live a dying life, Unsuccoured by the prompt relief of death. Thus did Sir Lancelot muse, till he was cheered, To think that Desolation had been borne, And sanctified, and through its whole extent Traversed with scrupulous survey by our Lord, Until it had become a Holy Land:â The very thought is wine unto the sick! He was in want of soothing truths, more want Than we can haply measure, who too much Feed on the balsams of the Cross, ere yet The gall hath done its work; for in those times, Those days of high attainments, less proclaimed, Because with less authentic warrant proved, Were Saint Alphonso's charitable rules, Whose safe facility he bade the world Enjoy, and yet denied it to himself. Months passed away with him, while sickness wrought Her silent transformations: from above She seemed to drop, and on her difficult field Toiled like a patient Angel, and observed A beautiful order in her separate acts. For first she cleared it of the unsightly shades Of self-deceit, which baffle even the eye Of conscience when it strives to penetrate; Then the rank herbage stripped, and laid all bare The unlovely surface and discoloured soil, And thus she killed self-trust: then delving deep, With general and confused commotion shook And troubled all the ground, both far and near, And singled out the dry insidious stones Which lure the fertile moisture to themselves, And traced with special care the arid roots Of discontinued sins, which now deprived Themselves of power to sprout, yet intercept The roots of virtuous plants as they descend; Thus Self was wholly killed, a real death Accomplished by the severing of the Soul From the sick Body, its chief aid in guilt. The Body's outward hindrance set aside, And Sin's mysterious coverts now disclosed, She, casting her gross implements away, Leaped in the grave, and settling fast on Sin, Transformed herself into a cleansing fire, Which searched the pestilence in its secret home, And with accumulated pains burnt out The poisonous substance, whose infectious power Had scorched the dew-damped earth: this second Act, Which followed on the painful death of Self, Effected by increase of torture, seemed An Act of love, to its dread office nerved By its own depth, by no vindictive ends Suggested, but unmixed beneficence, Mysteriously inventive to avoid A fruitless toil; and this, as after Death, The mystical and inward Death of Self, Might in the baths of Purgatory find An apt resemblance, whereof some men speak As of an ultimate baptism of the soul. Many there are who grievously misdeem The unfathomable ends of Corporal Pain, And its remedial powers: and thus account The observances of an ascetic life As bloodless shadows, and the men who fight Therewith as they who beat the elastic air; Or haply censure their hard usages As an affront to His benignant Love, Who, from His boundless Mercy, hath allowed His own eternal Glory to receive Increase from His subordinate creatures' bliss. Happy are they, if when they reason thus, They seek, though blindly, to extol His love, Not rather for themselves evade those acts The joy of which they do not comprehend, Or thro' the instinctive hatred of high thoughts Which passes current now for lowliness,â The wisdom of a pusillanimous age. Yet do they err, in pondering not the griefs That Love is multiplying on the earth All hours, and in adoring not the mode Which He vouchsafes to use with our poor race, Love seeking love among the shades of pain, In the cool times of life, when suffering frees The spirit from the ardours of the world, As once at eve in Eden He pursued His flying creature: and not less do they That humble courage disesteem, that heart To give as kings unto a king, infused By our transcendent union with our Lord, Both God and Man, the heart wherewith the Saints, Seeking for pain when it seeks not for them, Have ventured to be Gods unto themselves. And error beckons error: there are men, And some not proud, whose blindness might be termed The failing of mistaken gentleness, Who cannot with a child's heroic trust Lean on the Church's arm, while she displays The final vision of Eternal Pain. O unaffectionate Hearts! Ungrateful Souls! Go to the Passion, in the balance weigh How great the amount of our Atonement made Through corporal Suffering, count the separate Thorns, The undistinguishable number guess Of cruel Lashes; dive into the sea Of overwhelming Sorrows to whose deeps Language may do no more than point the way Unto the reverent silence of our thoughts:â And is there not a fitness that the pain, Thro' which in part our price was paid, should be The curse of those who have disowned the debt? When sorrow comes or sickness, ye are first To cry, A blessing: shall the Saints on earth Be sanctified by pain, yet it be called Unseemly for the torments of the Lost? And, seeing that Grace hath been conferred on all, Sufficient grace, or proximate or remote, O shall Eternity be thought too long For that appalling exile, when the Love And Justice sinned against are infinite? For as the measure of the sin hath been, So are the bounds of expiation; one, One infinite Ransom is already paid, And till a second be found it needs must be That Hell should be eternal. Wouldst thou know What are the limits of thine actual guilt? Of Catherine learn, the Sainted Genoese, Who prayed that to her soul might be disclosed The heinousness of but one venial sin, And when her prayer was answered, swooned away. Spread out your minds, ye faltering disputants! Until they compass what the Church hath ruled; For if ye teach an infinite Mercy joined With only finite Justice, ye do err Against that equal majesty which reigns Amid the awful attributes of God, And erring thus, it may be ye blaspheme. But while Sir Lancelot, in the mystic realm Of Sickness, passed thro' that benignant Death Of Self and thro' her purgatorial fires, No less had he experience of the truth That Sickness is not wanton with her rod, But she too hath a third estate, a place Hard by her fires, a land were none can go But they who have won patience by their prayers; And from whose fields the visitants bring back Strange narratives: this is her Paradise. O worth, yea ten times worth the weary days, The uneasy bed, the long dream-haunted nights, Are those permitted intervals of ease, When pain is stayed from interrupting prayer, Or marring holy thoughts, and feebleness Disarms the body of its power to prompt Self-trust, or nurse those spirit-wasting moods When with a sinful foresight many a man Builds and unbuilds his thriftless schemes, and makes An intellectual banquet of the future, In such poor revel squandering golden hours, Which might, through patience and conformity Unto the Will of God, have yielded him A usury the Saints would not disclaim. And oft our childhood, like a summer cloud Borne backward by the wind, returns to cast A radiant shadow on the sin-worn mind, And with it brings that softening of the heart, That leaning towards the innocent and good, Which in past years was virtue's best ally, And now, an unexpected visitant, Like a sweet apparition from the dead, Melts the hard heart with one benignant look, Most like the unspeakable Regard which fell On Peter, yea, to faith's clear eye it is, Veiled in our human memories, the Same! Such intervals of painless calm befell The patient Knight; the scourge in Satan's hand From time to time was partially restrained, That mercy might enquire how far her ends Were furthered by affliction: for the Powers, Justice and Mercy, love to walk the earth Wearing each other's garb; and in their strife, Outreaching one another in their zeal To do the work of love, a man discerns That marvellous concurrence of the good And ill of life, which in respect of him, And manifested only to himself, A private revelation sweetly clear, Is the supreme and blessed Will of God. And such a respite chanced to be his lot One morning when a fresh access of pain, And of the inward burning, through the night Had tried unto the uttermost his power Of meek endurance. From the half clothed boughs, And the wet-laden ivy leaves which hung Above his mullioned window, fell the rain In fitful splashes, while the cheerless wind Fought with the mighty buttresses that met And broke its violence: if that deep joy, Which the soul tastes at such an hour, were born Of sunny prospect or of welcome news, It had not then been his; but what he felt Needed not outward circumstance, but leaned Upon the invisible heights from which it came, No self-supporting faculty, but moreâ The Gift of God's Own Presence in the soul! O Gift unspeakably divine! to be At peace and yet in penance:âthis it is Which forms the secret science of the Saints,â To endure the vision of our sins, and yet To bear, with spirit tranquillized by awe, That Justifying Presence in ourselves With so much love as stays the guilty mind From being too much abashed; and hence we learn, That even self-accusation is a thing Of which wise men are parsimonious, lest They should speak evil of the things of God, And in their estimate of sin involve A consequence of grace; and lowliness Is not what some men deem it, but is nursed More when the greatness of God's mercy falls Like an o'erwhelming shadow on the soul, Than when it sits in judgment on itself. Upon his narrow bed Sir Lancelot lay, Though not in vocal prayer, yet with his thoughts Upraised to Heaven in wondering gratitude: For not less sudden was the welcome change Than to the storm-tossed voyager when his ship From the vexed waters springs, as from a bow, And in a moment glides within the mole Of some smooth port, and on her anchor there Rides like a bird upon an inland lake. Ah! who shall say what transport then was his! Wonder, and peace, and joy, and fervent love, Lightness of heart, and that unearthly sense Of God's forgiveness which so oft ensues On bodily pain, or on misfortune borne In penitent submission, and, with all, That consciousness of an immortal soul, And of a life beyond death's reach, which grows Upon the ruins of our animal strength, Whose separate liberty we realize With modest exultation and with prayer. And with the influx of these glorious thoughts His childhood passed into his soul once more, Taking his nature with such calm surprise That, ere he was aware, his ancient heart, His simple heart of childlike faith and love, With blissful travail was brought forth again, And scarcely conscious of the heavenly change, He wept some few sweet tears, and knew not why. Long had his thoughts of mingled love and fear In arduous meditation been sustained Upon the Passion, not unduly deemed The Christian's chief devotion, yet a scene So dark, so humbling, that it well may be At certain seasons more a source of fear Than consolation and confiding love; And a long vigil round the Saviour's Cross For our weak nature needs an Easter joy To follow, while a further help is sought In those bland intermissions, neither fast Nor wholly feast, the Sundays interposed As stations in the toilsome hills of Lent,â Toilsome for those who climb their stony sides Amid the obscuring mists of penance wrapped, But for the purer souls who go that road For contemplation, and to gain some place Nearer to Jesus, rather may we name Those welcome heights the Happy Hills of Lent. With this one subject occupied, his thoughts, Like weary birds too long upon the wing With nought but sea beneath them, had been fain To light, but found no resting-place till now, When, haply by suggestion from above, A new direction given unto their course Brought them above one solitary isle, One region of sweet truths which lies apart, Severed by secrecy divine, whose stores Are haply left as part of that reward Which is reserved for faith,âthe Infancy Of our Incarnate Lord; a radiant tract, Which from the Angel's covert message grows Upon the adoring eye, while on its shore The Shepherds watch, the Watching Angels sing, The Cattle low around the new-born Child, The Magians travel with the Star above, The obedient Star, a still slow-moving point Threading its way among the crowded orbs Without collision, like the Will of God Amid the multitudinous sins of men In heavenly peace accomplishing Itself. Beautiful Region! on its wondrous fields, As in compartments, but for twelve short years The Gracious Mystery is depicted; then Beneath a veil of heavenly clouds withdrawn, It mocks the disappointed eye, till faith Finds in the muteness of the Written Word A place for adoration more sublime, And loving acquiescence, than might be Haply in fuller knowledge. On this shore Sir Lancelot's thoughts alighted, with surprise As great as though it had not been a place, Which with his mother's guidance he had oft In early days explored. For so it seemed All new, and more than new, for it was clothed With freshness such as novelty alone Could never give; and on its fragrant fields He fell, like one who with his spirits depressed, And wonted cheerful visions overcast, By too long sojourn amid summits bare And the tremendous silence of the snow, The birdless sky, and giant-featured crags, Sinks on the Val Misocco from the heights Of Bernardin, and feeds his hungry eye Upon the sunny lowlands; and in folds, Dense folds of sylvan light and shade, enchains And masters that wild rapture which has held His chilled imagination in its grasp For many a wakeful night, and silent day More visionary than the night itself; And his unfettered thoughts, which fly abroad Amid the exuberant change, fix here and there In some bright spot an instantaneous home, As dear as though the accidents of years Had worn its features in the very soul. Silence! self-trusting Thoughts!âand Phantasy, Back to thy home; thou art not needed here; And here too be the anxious craft of verse Suspended for awhile. Thou, Spirit of Grace! Who from the Eternal Father and the Son Eternally proceeding, dost uphold Meek wills, and modest intellects no less Informest with sweet knowledge, guide my song, Guide it along a path of simple words, Amid whose reverential plainness men May better hear the echo of Thy Church, In festive liturgy or deep discourse Illustrating the Childhood of her Lord. And if with sedulous meaning I have sought And anxious purpose, to reflect the strife Of these our painful days upon my verse, With such suggestions as may lend some aid To those who walk in this dark land of ours, Now let it be permitted to retire, Where the mute Shadow of my song invites And beckons, into a chamber where the noise Of angry disputants is heard far off, If heard at all, a chamber of sweet truths Where for my profit I may dwell awhile With Mary and Saint Joseph, and the Three Who came with mystic Gifts, and Angel Choirs, And simple Shepherds, and the jubilant troop Of little Martyr-brethren who went out First followers of the Lamb, dear pursuivants, Who laid their bodies on the road, as pearls Or as sown stars, to signalize the way, Whereon the Apostles afterwards should tread, Martyrs and Virgins, Saints and pious Kings, And the vast concourse of the holy Church. O let us seek at least brief shelter there, And turn the helm of our half-shipwrecked thoughts. Our load is hard to bear;âthe world that seems So wise, and in some aspects so reformed, So needful to us, and full often kind, And of our very selves so much a part, Hath drifted from the sole authentic Church, Believes the false predominant therein, And in its very piety blasphemes Him who is true; yet doth it raise, with speech Respectful, and with no apparent guile, Full many an anxious question, that demands A ready answer, not so soothly found, And yet which may not now be long delayed Without the loss of many thousand souls. The load is hard to bear:âthe chance, that he, Who, as an act of faith, shall boldly cut All ties that bind him to his times, and thus Live out of sympathy with modern things, May scare the souls he haply might have won, And wound the Heart of Jesus by a zeal Unlike His own:âthis is an anxious fear. And then there lies the opposite chance, that he, Who with a facile deference to the world Should make the Church seem world-like, and give up Some of her heavenly maxims, and so clear His mind by making free with truth, should learn Hereafter to his cost that he mistook Selfwill for lowliness, and so become To one whole generation an offence:â And in this fluctuating doubt is grief Enough to cause gray hairs before their time. O problem of an unbelieving world! The hearts, that have been stretched upon the rack Of this most piercing doubt, may well believe No inward anguish can surpass its pain. But Oh! there is a torture worse than this,â The problem of the misbelieving good! For we would fain believe sweet things of those, More dear to us than words can tell, who seem So near the truth, yet ever fall away Further and further when they come most near, And altogether when they almost touch. Hard task to faith to leave all these to God, To trust Him and enquire not, but adore, In darkness which He wills not should be light, The merciful severities of truth. Only by holy living can we wring Light from the darkness, and at length go free Of our perplexing thoughts, while this great truth, Like a slow sunrise, dawns upon the soul,â That Goodness baffles Wisdom when they strive, And that they dwell together when at peace. And meanwhile let us seek not to be spared One jot of our perplexity, nor strive To extricate ourselves and stand aloof From the world's travail, nor forswearing thus Our special heritage, let us succumb To love of quiet, or the vile repose Of literary ease, than pomp of life More irreligious far: but let us strive To absorb a thousand hearts into our own, And force with irresistible success, Through secret prayer and outward sympathy, A Christian wisdom and magnanimous change Upon the sickly spirit of the Age. For love of Christ, we may not stand apart From the world's strife, nor basely satisfy Our indolence, by that ignoble boast, So oft the ready refuge of conceit, That our sole dealings are with ancient days, And that we scorn to suffer with our own? Remembering this, yet we may enter now The hermitage of peaceful thoughts hard by, And with the Shepherds kneel before the Child. Say, Mighty Mistress, O Celestial Faith! Why in untroubled rapture standest Thou Straining thine eye into the ages past? Ah! thou hast lit upon a wondrous scene, Withheld from mortal gazeâthat secret Hour,â Whether before sunrise at early prayer, Or the noon-day retirement of the East, Or meditative eve, or starry nightâ When, as the mother of mankind conceived From Satan's whispers that undying sin Which is the sin of all, so at the words Of Gabriel did the blissful Mother-Maid, Surprised yet acquiescent, then conceive Within her virgin-womb that Righteousness Who is the Righteousness of all. First fount Was that predestined hour of all those truths, Which in harmonious order rising, each From each, with inward melody construct The Catholic Faith wherein we live and breathe And are transformed into the sons of God, And made joint-heirs with Christ the Holy Child. Ah! see Him lying on our Lady's lap, The Saviour and the Maker of the World, Amid the winter's cold, the uneasy straw, And patient feeding beasts! How wonderful His Childhood, seeing He was God Himself! And, because wonderful, how winning too To us for love of whom it was endured! Those Sacred Feet shall walk the stony ways To do men good, who shall with foul return Transfix them with a nail: those Infant Hands Shall heal and bless and multiply the Bread Of His own Flesh, and they too shall be nailed Upon the bitter Cross; and yet for us, To be at that Right Hand is all our hope, To be upon that Left our only fear: And to faith's eye that Infant Head is crowned Already with ensanguined Thorns, which love, Weeping, may recognize for all her sins Foreseen and suffered, and thus learn to love, Like Magdalen, with more importunate hope. So did He elevate our mortal acts And sanctify our natural griefs: He spoke, He wept, He thirsted by the well at noon, Haply He smiled, and yet tradition saith He smiled not all those three and thirty years; But weptâwe cannot tell how oft He wept. And He endured the shame of Nakedness With the new Wine of His dear Passion wet, In that same hour wherein He stayed the Flood Of sin by Adam on the earth let loose; As Noe once had blamelessly endured In type, with words inspired upon his lips, The drunkenness wherewith the joyous Church, With her fresh Sacraments beside herself, Was rudely charged ere she was three hours old. O Nakedness of our most loving Lord, What comely cheering figure dost thou seem Of Adam bared unto the eye of God And shameful in his own, yet clothed again By Christ's unclothing of His glorious Self! How sweet the affectionate tradition too, By mindful Peter to the Church consigned, That in the lonesome night would Jesus rise, And visit the rude couches of His Twelve, And re-compose the garments disarrayed By graceless slumber; thus in outward deed, Gesture, and miracle, illustrating Through all those wondrous three and thirty years The invisible graces of His future Cross. Then from a Boy, O marvellous! He grew Like other men, in stature, and He seemed, Semblance for some mysterious reason worn, To grow in wisdom, and increase in grace. Yet sickness came not nigh Him, nor old age: But otherwise our true infirmities He with these notable exceptions bore. And let not these seem strange: what cause there was We know not, but with reverential love May ponder to our profit, if we keep Fast hold of that analogy of faith The Church exacts. Haply it was not well That He who was eternal should grow old Even in appearance: haply 'twas to show That now the length of years hath been unclothed Of its first Jewish blessing, that to die And be with Christ is better far than age. Sickness, which fled before His gracious Touch Or at His distant Word, might be forbidden To assail Himself, that so His Sacred Frame, And all its capabilities of grief, For that thrice blessed Woe might be reserved Wherein the world's Atonement was achieved: Or it might be that where the breath of sin Hath never passed, nor sickness nor old age Have privilege to enter; were it so, Then from our Lord's Humanity we learn, That holiness may be a means of health, Ascetic fast a secret source of strength, Vigil more true repose than purest sleep, And from its wells virginity distil (With inward singleness of heart combined) An agile freedom, an elastic joy, And a matured simplicity of youth, Which may perchance anticipate the bliss Of that angelic vigour which shall wait Upon our bodies when they rise:âand yet (Mindful of one how rightly dear to me!) Let not the soul of him, who on the bed Of weary sickness lies, be overcast Because Christ hath not borne this selfsame woe, Nor honored it in this specific form. Whether it be the aching strife of mind, Torture of heart or weight of bodily pain, Enough that in the Garden, on the Cross, And in His Life, all grief was sanctified. O Lord! who hast unto Thy humble Saints Full oft imparted grace to sing or teach The Sorrows of Thy Passion, grant to me, Without offence or rude surmise to sing The Sorrows of Thine Infancy, a depth, An inland sea of Heavenly Love, enclosed And overshadowed by the awful hills Of Olivet and Calvary, which calls, As deep to deep, to those surpassing Acts And final Woes of which it was the source. The man, who had no childhood, fell; how strange The thought appears! yet Adam had a time Of peace and joy, but Thine from first to last, From the rude Manger to the ruder Cross, Was one assiduous martyrdom, but crowned And consummated, deepened not begun, Amid the darkness of Thy closing days. The solitude, the chillness, and rough scenes Of Thy Nativity, the willing Blood Which at the bidding of the Law was shed, The Flight to Egypt, and hard sojourn there, The obedient Privacy within the house Of Thy reputed Fatherâah! how great Were these humiliations to the Lord Who fashioned, and in all those selfsame years, As God, sustained the fabric of the world! Yet these were but the surface of Thy Grief. Before Thine Eyes the Passion ever stood, A vivid apparition: Thorns and Nails, Each separate act of fierce indignity And wanton outrage wounded then Thy Heart With a mysterious keenness: for 'twas said By them of old, who with tradition's help Interpreted the doctrine of Saint Paul, That, for Thy use predestined, was prepared A human body, specially ordained, And with most exquisite organs all attuned, For suffering and capacity of pain, Within the bounds of true humanity. And long ago with plaintive eloquence In old prophetic song Thou didst address Thyself to God, From My youth up have I Thy terrors with a troubled mind endured, And yet a second time, My heaviness Is ever in My sight;âyea, ever, Lord! And growing with Thy growth: and yet There is behind a more surpassing grief, Exceeding far the foresight of the Cross, A grief men cannot measure, till they learn Within the perfect schools of Heaven to take The altitude of sin, and of the bar It rears between the human soul and God. The vision of sin was with the Holy Child;â All sins that lurking in the long, long past Cried for His expiation, all the sins Now daily perpetrated in the world, The hidden things of this most beautiful night, Our own short-comings of the day just gone, All pressed into His spirit, like the Thorns Crushed by the smiting reed into His Head. Amid the delicate years of Infancy, Mary's exuberant love, and Joseph's care Full of affectionate awe, and watchful joy, Envying the Mother's freedom,âmid it all, Age after age defiling in His sight, He had respect to each particular sin. O weary, weary burden! borne for us Even by the Infant Saviour, on His Heart Bearing the Cross He bore in open day In after years, no heavier load than this. And while He saw how men would slight His Love, And how each age in its peculiar way Would crucify their Lord afresh, He cried Unto the Father in prophetic plaint, My God! what profit is there in My Blood? And Thou wert Man! O Everlasting God! And in Thyself vouchsafedst to adorn And beautify humanity, and found In fashion as a servant, didst descend On our behalf to sanctify Thyself! Gaze on His Childhood, Faith and Hope and Love! Gaze with the Angels that are stooping still From heavenly heights o'er this mysterious work, In mute or vocal adoration fixed! Ye, above all, who seek to come forth Saints From this perplexing strife, O rise and gaze On this new thing created on the earth, The Lord's Humanity: upon His Youth, His Ministry, His crowded Passion gaze! Ponder it well; for many have there been, Who with false reverence, and a scanty love, And an unquiet ignorance, have misdeemed, To their own hurt, this doctrine of the faith, Lowering the rule of holy life, to augment Their trust, which is no trust, in Christ Alone. These, when they read of some celestial height Of our Lord's virtue, as a perfect man, With undistinguishing impatience cry, Behold His Godhead! oft transferring thus To His Divinity the sacred fruits Of His unspotted Manhood, till they lose The force of His example, and contract The truth to heresy, and soon forego In act or even endeavour that strict life Which His humanity doth illustrate, Or haply as an absolute rule impose. Condemned theology it is to say That in the law God bids impossible things Unto His creatures: when He bids He warns, Warns us to do what we can do, to ask What lies beyond our strength, and by His grace Puts it within the compass of our strength. So rule the Fathers, who in council sate In that fair city whose cathedral bells Blend with the rushing of the swift Adige. O rather fearing greatly to be wise Above the Written Word, let us return And through the fourfold Gospel trace the signs Of His pure human virtue, on the Church And her Tradition leaning, lest we err. There let us contemplate with emulous awe How, like a man and by a human way, Though from the first all depths of grace were His, And an ungrowing sanctity, He seemed To learn obedience, and by suffering taught To grow to that great perfectness, whereby He was the author of eternal life To all the obedient; haply pondering this, We may through prayer win courage to behold And go some little way towards those heights, Which grace and our dear Lord's example make, If hard, yet possible; and this the more, Supported by the knowledge that we are Of His Humanity participants, Couched in the fluent Water and the Grain Of Chosen Wheat, the mighty Sacraments Which make us just with God, and deify Our human nature through the power of faith. This is the end of man:âfar off to look, Without approach, upon the glorious Power, The Justice, and the Wisdom of his God, And with the thought of these great things converse In trembling silence, in the shadow sitting, Self-stilled, of God's most awful Attributes And His disclosed Perfections; one there is Which claims a different worship, nor can be Inactively adored, but with strong cries And tears must be pursued, His Sanctity, Who bids our holiness reflect His Own, And be His Own, and therefore sent His Son That we might better compass with His Aid That only imitable Attribute, Least imitable, as it seems, of all. O Lord! upon the threshold do I stand Of that veiled interval of twice nine years, Which hides Thy Sacred Manhood from our view, Till from the Jordan we behold Thee rise, As from a second Nativity;âthe seal Of that forbidden treasure do I kiss With humblest love; yet, O most gracious Lord! Let me be bold thereon to found a prayer For our poor times and Thy neglected Church. For when I think how every passing hour In all those eighteen years Thou didst vouchsafe To speak or act, to worship and obey, That every motion of Thy manhood was Humiliation, and was infinite Because of Thy Divinity,âamazed Within the sea of my own troubled thoughts I sink, perceiving that each act of Thine, Thus infinite, might haply have redeemed, If God so willed, the sins of all the world. Then Lord! most good, most holy! if the world Beyond all ancient precedents of ill Hath visibly swerved, in order and in truth, From Thy celestial pattern, and foregone That catholic unity wherein consists The vigour of its supernatural life,â By all the merits of those silent years, By all the deeds and sayings unrevealed Of Thy mysterious Youth, vouchsafe to give A second Youth to this enfeebled world, And reinfuse the sacrament of health Thro' its unequal and distempered limbs, And chiefly for that end, O multiply Thy grace upon Thy chosen seat of Rome! Thus far, haply too far, my ardent song, Coasting this marvellous shore, hath dared to say How fair the land appeared; and what it left Of fancy unexpressed shall now be laid, With all the guesses fertile wonder breeds, A sacrifice of silence, on the shrine. For there be thoughts, whose grateful hardihood May win acceptance there, for which the garb Of words were all unmeet, and which might seem Too venturesome if it were not that love Is nourished on them. May they not displease Him for whose love they have been entertained! Such was Sir Lancelot's study, and to him Like some devotional picture it appeared, Where on one field a mystery is set forth In diverse acts, and hills rise all around Capped with blue pine-trees set against the sky, As the old Christian artists loved to paint. And this similitude they will not deem Beneath the heavenly subject, who are wont To read that sweet theology involved In the mute gestures of the sacred groups, Which great Angelico of old pourtrayed, Justly beatified, as claiming rank Amid the doctors of the Church; nor less, With his devotional system, in his way Of eloquent silence, comments on the faith, Than Bonaventure or St. Thomas, freed From many a formal strife and hard device To which their gentle minds were forced to bow, Though in their lightest question there is hid More food than in the strength of other minds. Such was the Sacred Infancy of Christ To that lone Sufferer in his silent cell. Ah! how consoling was this heavenly field, This catholic pasture where his thoughts lay down To feed and rest! For when the intellect Is weak and overstrained, there are some truths The passive heart can better apprehend, Than weary reason; and her docile toil Can recreate and tranquillize, not bend The burdened faculties. Consoling too Chiefly was this sweet subject now to him, As being less intertwined with human sin Than the great Passion, deepening penitence More by its downeast bearing than the voice Of open admonition; not as though It were not guilt which instigated love To bear that lesser yoke, but that he felt The visible presence of his sins was there Far less with him, than underneath the Cross. Weeks fled in this devotion, and the spring Was passing into summer, when it chanced There came on ardent mission to the House Of Calder an Italian monk, a man For holy life and supernatural gifts Alike renowned, and, it was whispered there, Favoured with revelations; and impressed Upon his bodily flesh it was believed Was some tremendous cognizance, the sign Of fearful strife with man's invisible foes. A son he was of that mysterious land, The barren Umbria, brother of a house, Whose airy bells, almost in faintness lost, Hardly upon calm summer mornings shed Sweet murmurs on the vale; so high it stands Amid the many-folded Apennines. Beautiful Mountains! who that hears your name Is not in spite of nature and himself Forthwith a poet? Yea, the very sound Plays with the mind, even as the forest wind In summer with the multitudinous trees: So various are the chords which it doth press, So strangely wild the symphony they make:â Love, War, and Pleasure, memorable Crime, The seeds of Freedom working through the soil In a tempestuous spring of civil strife, Antique memorials, Roman or Tyrrhene, Legends and Towers of mediÃ¦val fame, The verse of Dante lingering still to add Music unto a hundred sweet-named brooks, Art, Faith, and numberless remembrances Gleaned in our travels there, or localized In study's more imaginative hours In those fair spots where all the world hath been, If not in presence, yet with heart and eye, Genoa, and Naples, or the glistening towns Which Arno laves! O Range of Apennines! How clear athwart my vision dost thou come Mid the elm-shadowed meads by Nenna's side, Growing so real as oft to intercept With purple line the tower of Fotheringay! Thee would I celebrate in grateful verse, Mindful of that most pregnant hour when I Sat in the heart of Pisa on the quay, The loitering Arno at my feet, and mused Upon the manifold story of thy hills, Heathen or Christian. Ah! how went the hours With noiseless lapse amid thy balmy skirts Of orange blossom, and the odorous breaths From the warm fig-leaves steaming up thy sides, Or in the lanes where on the Mayday morns The gentle breeze brings down a snowy shower Of flaky wool from off the poplar boughs, Strewing their vernal fleeces on the ways; While in the pale green light of olive groves The birds would sing unto the lisping sea All through the drowsy noon, so like the eve Is that soft foliaged twilight; and for leagues The eye enjoys with rapture unappeased The constant presence of that Earthly Sky, That Sea whose brightness has no adequate name! How pleasant too, more oft than need required, The rests upon some castellated steep, Where the red broken ground might almost seem Wet with the blood of Guelph or Ghibelline, And there to muse upon the stirring past, While to the haply lifted eye there came Strange emblem of the present,âslope and field And woodland, diverse kinds, all chained in one With shackles of green vine, a sunny green Jocund and bright as Italy herself Wearing her chains in helpless happiness! Sweetest, because most solemn, was the hour When in the sanctuaries of the hills The vesper bells from many a summit tolled Or woody ledge, amid whose latticed leaves The clambering stars went in and out, now lost, Now launched upon the greenly glowing sky Of those strange twilights, while the freshening breeze Woke in the place, and wrinkled here and there The mantle of umbrageous chestnuts thrown Across thy ruddy limbs; and, touching sight! As by the Ave summoned up, the moon Would oft surmount some darkling eminence, And reign at once o'er all the silent glens! Beautiful Mountains! not for these your gifts, Nor for the pageantries, far off or near, Of light and shade upon your tinted sides, Not for the name of Dante, though revered, Nor for the secular chronicles which ye Illuminate, much less for works of art Too oft subservient to voluptuous ends,â Not for all these I fain would ornament My verse with you, illustrious Apennines! Hills of the Saints! though haply ye may mate In gifts of natural beauty with the heights Of the whole world,âin this, more beautiful That ye have been more sanctified; and crowned With a peculiar light and set apart, A western Palestine, by mighty deeds Of faith, and that your blue and shadowy dells Are with miraculous presences endowed In wild strange-featured places. In your caves Marvellous legends have been localized Of rescues, and of apparitions seen, Our Lady or the Saints; and mid your folds, Where the scant chestnut screens not from the sun The shining waste of stones, lies buried deep, Untravelled still, the Preternatural Land, The famous Umbria in eternal shades, Umbria, the refuge of pure Christian Art When Florence served false Gods, the theatre Of those Franciscan wonders which have stirred With their seraphic tales the penitents Of many an age, and cheered the godly poor. Hills of a thousand sanctuaries! to me It is a consolation at this hour, And on this unkept feast, exiled alas! Amid the silent Alps, to think of you Trembling amid the uproar of the bells, Which shoot, twixt heaven and earth, one jubilant thrill From white Savona to the modest cape, Which at Ugento dips into the sea, And westward to the bright Calabrian shore That smiles on Etna; and uncounted prayers Mount with the sunrise from your steepled heights, While, in her bays beneath, the Midland Sea Shakes off the mists of night, and with her waves Kisses your naked feet, in sign of love, And worships Heaven with her elysian calm. Fair Genoa hears, and answers from her strand, And Florence hears, and Pisa, and the streets Of old Bologna, and the Sienese Join in the service, and the wild wind wafts O'er the torn sides of Radicofani The growing echo, while the mystic Dome Above the broad campagna's yellow waste Shines like a beacon, to the keen-edged heights Of far Abruzzo; and Apulia learns Her faith and worship from thy many arms Which compass her about:âand then, sweet Hills! Not now alone, but for long years to come, If years be mine, one image shall enrich My evening solitude, that peaceful scene The monks on Mount Carotta may behold Close in the shaded east, not hard to see What time the sun hath sunk, for those who place A rock between the glory and themselvesâ Where from between two streams Loreto looks O'er the smooth Adrian, and the swinging bell Soothes many a sea-borne voyager, as once That sacred promontory soothed myself, Sailing beneath unto the ports of Greece One starlit eve! From Umbria's spectral woods Was that Itinerant Monk, who far and wide Preached with a hardy zeal in many a tongue To the rich abbeys that had now relaxed Their Founder's obligations; for he felt, And as a rule acknowledged in his heart, The pressure of the times in which he lived, When men, both high and low, had such respect Unto their fellows, that in every act, Oft touchingly developed, we behold Their sense of that lay-priesthood which compels The Christian to communicate his good, Yet, honoring not their impulse as a law, Sought for the sanction of the Church to speak: And Potentates and Peers rejoiced to die Clad in Franciscan habits, not as though The holy garb could stand them in the stead Of holy hearts, nor with an ignorant hope Of entering Heaven beneath a Church disguise,â But by this protestation to declare More notably unto the world, how death Cancelled their former estimate of good. In Calder's humid vale for many a week That wandering Preacher rested, and he heard Full oft at noon, when silence was relaxed, (The slumber of hot climes not needed there, But recreating converse in its stead) Some novel surmise canvassed by the monks About the nameless Leper, and, the day Ere his departure, sued the abbot's leave To speak in secret with the unknown man, Which he with much entreaty hardly gained. Sir Lancelot lay that evening on his bed, While the weak splendours of the setting sun Fell on his wasted countenance, nor annoyed, So impotent the beams, his half-closed eyes. In prayer or prayer-like thought immersed, the Knight Perceived not when the gently opened door Closed on the Preacher, till the silent Monk, Crossing himself, stepped forward from the shade And stood between the window and the couch, So that his obscure features and his head, Transfigured in the misty sunbeam, seemed As some appearance not of common sort, But with a glory circled, like the Saints For works of love remanded to the earth. The doubtful Knight, surprised, yet all composed, Like a sick man when in his ear you tell Some stirring news of earth, whose littleness His soul in its long sufferings hath outgrown,â Demanded of the speechless Figure, whence He came, and for what end: and in a tone Of tremulous sweetness, most unlike the voice Before which Chapters quaked and Mitred Heads, The holy Preacher thus addressed the Knight. Sir Lancelot! the currents of our lives Now for the third time cross, and for the last. Ask not my name; enough that I can show There have been passages betwixt us, such As well may breed implicit trust in both, And warrant open speech. Be it allowed That I in brief resume your former years, Not in their acts, but in the hidden course Which they have run, and windings they have known. There is a mercy in past sins which thou Beyond most other men hast proved;âin this The whole interpretation of the life Of an Unstable Will is mostly found. Thy one great mortal sin hath been thy shield, By forcing lowliness upon thy soul, Hatred of self, and penitential acts Which in the shape of doctrine found no room, No entrance gained in thy too happy heart. The abundance of materials for good Threaten perdition to a soul, unfixed And unsustained by weight of outward griefs Or bodily pain: a nature well may be Too fertile in its tendencies to good, And therein find its evil: conscience lives, And rules in freedom, rather where the Will Is single, and in steadiness of aim And unity of inclination finds The difficult balance on whose tremulous edge, Safe as the hills, she sets her quiet throne. And this thou wilt interpret to thyself From out the mixed experience of the past. In all thine acts, from boyhood to the strength Of thy maturer years and solid strife, This problem was thy trialâto admit In those great matters that concern thy peace, That to be Safe was better than to risk Security and all thy Former Good To attain a Possible Height: that Good itself Grows to be Best, but only comes thereto Through Growth which is a natural sacrament, And has the blessing by exclusive right; And, finally, that Change is such an ill, That they who scorn the appointed path of Growth, Put all the past away, and take by storm The fortress of perfection, either find An empty citadel of gilded clouds, Or in the leap from earth to heaven, by Change Are overweighed, as by a counterpoise, And so are lost in sin, which as a sea Flows between Good and Best. Have not thy falls Been just so frequent as thy vain attempts, Upon the pinions buoyed of weak self-will, To cross that sea and miss the tottering bridge Of slow Attainments and of daily Acts, Whose ends are held by Angels, and whose chains Vibrate amid the storms, but cannot fail? No more of this: thy days are numbered now, But, to the last, keep close before thy thoughts That opposite wisdom, in neglect of which Thy former life was moulded and so failedâ That he, who, whether in the shape of sin Or of attainment, cuts the past away, And drifts before his time upon the sea Of Heavenly Mercy, enters on a voyage Unnamed, unknown amid the elder Saints. God's Mercy is around thee, like a deep; Enough for thee the prospect of it now; That prospect is a promise: to the rash There is no sea which hath so many storms! Sir Knight! we have encountered twice before, Twice when thy life was turning on the hinge Of Good or Ill! Rememberest thou the day When first we met?âmy face is haply changed, But I have vouchers thou wilt recognize. Where two roads join, not far from mighty Rome, We hailed each other, both in mutual need Of some companion better than our thoughts Then were; thou from Viterbo cam'st, and I From Bracciano, bearing in my arms An image of our Lady: 'twas a day Of most uncheerful kind; Soracte stood Half veiled, and o'er that mournful plain the clouds Hung like a level pall, whose murky folds There was no wind to ruffle. When we came Unto the guard-house by the Milvian bridge The soldiers jested on my habit; one With impious wit refused to life the chain, Demanding toll for three, since though I bore The Image in mine arms, it was a third, And Rome was over-peopled in that way. Stung by the cowardice that thus could vent Its wanton insults on a helpless Monk, Thou didst, albeit without thy gauntlets on, Strike the rude Roman down, and his compeers Stood silent by, with one safe act content, Keeping the barrier latched to intercept Our further progress; and I noted well Thy tranquil words in that exciting hour;â âBrother!â thou saidst, â'twere better to return; Some little increase of the way is not Much hardship to a Soldier or a Monk; To me it matters not; and in good sooth It were a better omen to thyself, Thus barred from entering by the People's Gate, To choose the Gate of Angels.â And forthwith, Under the shadow of the Marian Mount, Skirting the Tyber, we addressed our steps Unto the Saxon suburb of great Rome. Slowly we walked, for we were weary; thou By serious converse didst beguile the way, Relating how that some few days ago Thou wouldst not for a monk have interfered With soldiers' sport, believing that we were A dissolute and indulgent race, whose time Was shared 'twixt sluggish idleness and feast. But at Viterbo, stopped outside the gate Which looks toward Bolsena, because the hour Of midnight then was passed, upon the turf Pacing in self-defence against the cold, Thou heardst the monks within the city walls Chanting their midnight psalms, and it was sweet, And soothed thy weariness, and thou didst vow A vow 'gainst thine uncharitable thoughts, If thou shouldst haply light upon a monk In some distress to rescue him, a vow Which gave thee but brief credit: in reply I told thee that in lieu of empty thanks I rather would exhort thee to be strong In all good purposes, for at that hour Some mercy might be near thee, so assured From my past life was I of this sweet truth;â A good deed is a prophecy of good To him who does it,âlittle deeming then That in an hour that prophecy should reap So bounteous a fulfilment! There are times When with accumulated impulse life Springs forward suddenly, and overshoots The counted hours of time: and we were then In one of those swift seasons. By such talk, And by the Tyber fretting on its shore, Which called to mind the lapping of thy lake Of Kentmere mid its dry autumnal reeds, Thy heart was softened, and in penitent mood Thou sankest down abruptly on thy knees, Confessing that to do a mortal sin And not for prayer or pilgrimage, thou cam'st Unto that Holy City. 'Twas an hour Of joy that had no easier vent than tears, When mid the rain, which then fell heavily, Beneath the shelter of the ilex boughs Thou mad'st a full confession of thy life Humbly upon thy knees: the dripping rain Which came on thy bare head and trickled down Thy face, methought it was the fluent drops Of Baptism coming into thee once more By penance fetched from Heaven; and when we left That ilex by the milestone, we beheld The clouds dispart; and Rome's innumerous towers, Like a transfigured city, seemed to smile Upon the penitent who now drew nigh In martial guise, but with a pilgrim's heart. And both, the Popular Entrance roughly barred, Entered the City by the Angels' Gate Beneath the very shadow of the Shrine! Sir Lancelot! it boots not to describe Our second meeting, when it was, or how; Enough that I was with thee once again When thy good Angel overtook thee, clothed In his most favourite guise, some wandering form Of thy lost childhood, in a trivial sign Invested, when from o'er the low stone wall, Which fenced the lawn, thou saw'st the bright blue line Of noiseless wind move down the silver lake, And with a slow encroachment steal away The unruffled surface, till the drowsy trees Flung off the weight of noon, the willow branch Scattered the tinkling drops from off its sprays, And the crisp foliage of the poplar boughs Shook out its vocal leaves; and in that wind Came Memory and thine Angel. By his help, And with some poor suggestions from myself, Thou wert permitted to retrieve the good Which from thy fickle purpose had escaped. Thou wilt remember well the time and place, When thou wert hid, in opportune retreat, Deep in the woody shore where huge Mont Blanc Looks o'er the slopes of Savoy, and the spears Of his invisible guards, uplifted high, Glance through the quivering mist as though they were In actual motion on the long white wall, And vacillating with the lazy tread Of weary sentinels: and that same eve Recovering from the sickness of thy thoughts, Thou wilt remember with what fretful pace, As though eye-stricken by the curious crowd, In thy distempered fancy, thou didst thread The alleys of the purse-proud town that keeps The outlets of the impatient Rhone, and sat'st Upon the ramparts facing the Saleve, Whose white-ribbed precipice the setting sun Feebly ensanguined, while beneath thy feet A lonely bell-frog from the reedy fosse Rang his distinct and melancholy fall, Not harshly, to thy travel-wearied mind Most soothingly attuned. Thy days are now Fast coming to a close, yet do not fear; By this disease shall death no access gain, But in a calm and very silent hour Thou shalt do battle with him, and prevail. Long years ago it chanced that I was sent, A Novice in our Order, to attend The sufferers in a lazar-house, then filled With lepers like thyself; and when I saw The strange appearance and the loathsome marks Of that disease, I turned my back and fled, And in my haste a wooden Crucifix Fell from my hands, and broke upon the ground. For this fastidious weakness I imposed Austerest penance on myself, and vowed If I, by such a chance as well might wear The aspect of Divine Intention, found A leper near me, I would kiss his sores In honour of the charity of Christ: And whether for temptation of my pride, Or as a guerdon for my vow, it so hath been That ever from the hour of my embrace The sickness hath begun to disappear. And therefore, Brother! I embrace thee now As freely as I would a rosy child, In expiation of my former sin, And honour of the charity of Christ! The shaded face, the uncertain stream of words, The quiet agitation of his voice, The clasping arms, the glory-circled headâ Was all a bodiless vision? Was that form A creature of the sunbeam that had passed, And which had faded with the fading light? So like a silent-footed shadow came The unlooked-for Apparition, so it went As though it melted with the sinking ray. And then the piping of the blackbirds grew With such a gradual increase on his ear, That, like a river whose far sound we lose, Yet so recover that it does not seem To suffer interruption, those sweet songs So brought his former to his present thoughts, That they o'erflowed the interval between. Then was it all the sick man's phantasy? O no! the pressure of the Monk's embrace Still glowed upon him; still the fervid kiss Felt like a seal upon his leprous brow. Sir Lancelot slept, and in his sleep he dreamed; Upon the darkness of the night he saw Within an oval ring of cherubs' heads The Blessed Mother with her Holy Child. All mortal she appeared, and with a mien Of very gracious woe, or wistful joy Which rises from unconsummated hopes, And is itself a suffering, such as might Have been her aspect, when upon the Child She gazed and gazed, as old Saint Simeon spake. So to Sir Lancelot's eyes she was vouchsafed. She, stooping from the luminous cincture, placed Her radiant Burden in his outstretched arms: And all was dark that moment to his sight, Dark as the darkness after lightning, when No thunder occupies the other sense To throw the vision off its rigid guard. But from the time of that Embrace, each day The vigour of his blood returned, and drove The leprosy before it; and each night The Vision was vouchsafed unto his eyes; And, as the Saviour's Infancy had been An inward balm of slow distilling thoughts, Which were a medicine to his failing heart, So now the nightly visit of the Dream Infused into his slumber such a peace, That Night and Day seemed rivals in the work Of restoration, and with emulous speed Toiled for each other, till in nine short days, Emancipated from his gloomy cell, He was once more allowed the inspiring joy Of outward sunshine and the earth's green face. There is a cloister by the river side, A cloister of thin pillared trees which stand So close they hinder one another's growth; And up the branchless stems the sallow moss Encroaches yearly, and across the stream The dull red rocks with dripping cowls of weed O'erhang that belt of wood: and O how fair From out the covert seem the brilliant meads And quiet abbey, when the setting sun, Piercing the silent shades, comes unawares Through the green leaves, and many a scattered trunk Is fluted with the transitory gold. There many an hour Sir Lancelot enjoyed The cautious happiness, as of a child Forgiven, that timorous buoyancy which springs In the tamed spirit of a man released From the sick-room, who slowly gathering strength, Lives in the partial liberty of hope, With senses through his bodily weakness brought In unconstrained subjection to his soul, And mind sufficiently above the world To be at peace therewith. The voices borne From out the village hostelry hard by, The sportive cries of children on the bridge, The sounds of human labour faint and far, The evening thrush, the dashing of the stream, The almost silent gambols of the hares In the tall grass,âthese were his simple joys Which called him not to lift his downcast eyes From the brown path; for in his feeble stateâ Sick men full oft have proved it to themselves, And old men tooâsound was to him far more Than sight, as being more passively received. Along that sounding cloister once again He passed unto his little hermitage. There was the mystic vale,âthe broken crest Of that dull mountain, and the blended sounds Of earth and sea, wild birds and bleating flocks, The pale green grass, and tightly-rooted ferns:â All was the same, and were it not that he Was conscious of a change, the past might seem The sicknesses we suffer, or the deaths We die, when in the tyrannous embrace Of those mysterious panics of the night, The penal dreams which follow careless days, As if, alas! we were already judged, And that our doom was of eternal woe,â Colossal fears, which come to cleanse the soul, And scare it deeper down into itself. BOOK VIII. THE CONFESSION. Yet once again the rudder of my song I turn, and seek, not easily found out, Our Lady's ancient shrine in Frudernesse. No stag that hears the hunting-horn from far Lies closer in his lair than did that pile Shrink from the roving eye of hungry Scot. Wave after wave of treeless slopes, all blithe With yellow corn, stretched like a swelling sea From gulf to gulf across that tongue of land In billows of red soil that eastward dipped, Flowing towards Morecambe Bay; and keen the sight That o'er those ridges looked nor overshot That sunken trough, though by a tremulous vein Of waving tree-tops partially betrayed. There the Cistercian Abbey lies, embowered In hanging groves, the view this way and that Impeded by a folding screen of hills; Only, where prayer must go, the eye might range A tract of clear uninterrupted sky. Once was that hollow dell a censer sweet From which the sacrifice of faith and hope And love, expressed in ritual acts divine, In one continuous column rose to Heaven. But now, a vulgar desolation left, The weedy and dismantled ruin stands A trophy, for there be who boast it so, Round which the newly-fashioned faith may sing Its proud idolatrous pÃ¦ans, with such space Of summer silence intervening there As may suffice for sad and pensive hearts To pray and weep within the broken choir, And through devout regrets to learn the worth Of ancient creeds, and so, by grace inspired And with a blessing furthered, then assist To overturn that worship which enthrones The formal understanding in the room Of faith profound and pure adoring love, And with a well-contrived insertion slides Between the sinner and the Cross a form Of base will-worship; while in these our times The native wants of humankind, the thirst Of pining souls, the joyless solitude Of craving conscience, and the painful cry Of reason now collapsing on itself,â All, by the grace of God, this creed outgrow, This miserable pageant of untruth, Feeble with three poor centuries of age. The Vale of Nightshade was that hollow named, The Bekansgill, amid whose poison-plants The name of Mary, like the silent breath From off the lily beds, imported there Took sweet possession of the woody glen. And in the frosty starlight, and the dawn Of vernal days, and summer's lingering eve, And when the storms were launched from Furness Fells On the vast ocean, threatening as they went, Or when the low depending sky wept tears, Or clung in tearful mist upon the woods Rank with the drowsy breath of hemlock flowers, Still, in a tide of service mounting up To Pentecost, and falling sweetly off, Dispersed on unmemorial weeks and days, Till Advent heads the pilgrim year once more, There rose the sedulous voice of holy prayer, The silent praise of contemplative faith, Andâman's best offering to the Eye of Heaven, Sole evidence of spiritual growth,â The secret course of meek self-sacrifice. How gently summer hath possessed herself Of all the quiet being of the place! Here do I lie within the roofless nave, With no self-blame, while joining humbler thoughts And lesser recollections with regrets That from a higher and holier source proceed, And momentary humours of despair, Which end by breathing more courageous hopes, Inwardly felt, of better things to come, And sweet retrievals won through perilous change, The present hazarding in hope to find Foundation for the future, and outdo,â Faith brooks not fearâthe whole magnificent Past! Yon pelletery, that in silken tufts Innumerous, with glossy leaf and flower Of sanguine purple, from the chink protrudes, And sucks medicinal virtue from the stones, May school the meditative heart to find Meet nutriment of moral import here, Where nature with her placid beauty clothes The sin of man, and time, while he unveils His melancholy features to the light In spots like these, yet smooths his lineaments To grace, lest thought that came to learn should steal Affrighted from the presence of the sage. Mingled with such reflections, personal thoughts From these memorial ruins spring, grave joys Of friendship plighted here in dreamy youth, Which is not surely changed nor passed away, Though in affectionate sallies less delighting, And in wild sport, by growing breadth of years Discountenanced! Those alders by the rill, Which, brother-like, incline their mossy trunks Upon each other, and that orchard plot With crippled ranks of old and leaning trees, With chaste and waxen applebloom besprent, The tall rank sward that grows beneath their boughs, The subterraneous tinkling of the brook, The dull dark tufts of flowerless daffodil That with their green mosaic pave the door Of the antique chapter-house,âall seem to me But images transplanted from a dream, Themselves scarce real even where they stand;â Yea, from that dream transferred, when the outer world, Its doing and its suffering, were as nought, And our impassioned lives were proud to steer A course apart, and friendship, like a fount Cool-eyed and chaste, perennial sweetness gave Without satiety; and, happiness Being, without some want, insensible, There rose for its completion in the soul A hunger to be more and more beloved, A famine that resolved to be unfilled, Lest the bright plenty among which it dwelt Should seem less bright, when satisfaction dulled The sharpness of that exquisite desire. There mid the peace and old familiar forms Of that mute hollow, in whose weedy crypts Time with a faltering purpose lingers now, Enamoured of the beauty of his work, Which more elaborate touch will only spoil, Must I divert the channel of my song, Even now too much arrested in its course, While I have wandered up and down to cull These pleasant recollections of my youth, And from my purpose innocently strayed. 'Twas noonday on Black Combe; Sir Lancelot Was praying on the summit of the hill: And thither came a pious Bernardin From out of Furness, by the Abbot sent With message brief but full of peace and joy. Within the glen, upon the mountain-top, The Church with pleased solicitude had kept Her eye upon the separated man; And now the Legate had transmitted powers By which the Penitent might be received Once more within the pale of Holy Church. Such were the tidings, by Sir Lancelot heard With wonder and submissive thankfulness. Long time he prayed to God, long time he wept, And kissed the earth of that lone mountain-top; While, with contagious impulse sinking down, The Bernardin both wept and prayed with him; Till in that wild and solitary place, Sweet foretaste of communion with his kind, The Monk embraced the Penitent, and, love Outrunning forms, bestowed the kiss of peace. Within St. Mary's Chapter-house the Knight Met with that famous Abbot, Hugh de Bron, By him saluted with grave kindliness; And at the feet of that most holy man, Throughout the wide Cistercian world revered, Kneeling in penitential guise, he told With many a pause, and most circuitous speech, As is the want of solitary men, His sinful deeds, and his confession thus, Half history and half confession, made. O Man of God! I pray thee, hearken now; My tale can tell in what unthought-of ways, And with what travail, Christ's Almighty Love Goes out into the Babel of the world All day and night in quest of erring souls. Father! to me the cause of mortal sin Was briefly this: I had been wronged in love, A wrong which more than fathomed all the depths Of natural forbearance, and might strain The love, divinely tempered, of the Saints. But what, in such a holy place as this, Imports the mention of terrestrial love? The injury was another's sin, not mine; Therefore in my confession claims no place. And, truth to say, so many years have past Since from the depths of memory mortal love Hath risen in tangible disguise of words Upon my spirit, that I scarce could clothe That early passion in a fitting style, Or with accoutrement of current phrase. Enough that I was wronged, that for that wrong, Not for the love of Christ, I sought the East, And through the recklessness I had of life Was eminent in fight above my peers. The storm of sacred war then lulled awhile, I went in search of venturous enterprise, Martial or politic, as chanced to come, Among the Latin principalities Which were as islands in the troubled East. And in my lonely travel oft I nursed My wrong, and diligently kept awake The thought of vengeance; though in early years, Earlier than youth, good Father! I had been Touched with the sweetness of celestial grace, And would have sought a cloister, had not love Caused me to swerve from that design. Yet soon, In lonely hazard and long journeys tried, I felt as if that earlier stream of grace Was being unsealed far down within my heart,â Hopes which a sudden chance, or rather plot Of evil powers allowed, too soon dispersed, Temptation coming ere my soul was winged For flight, and so was caught within the nest Unfledged:âwith that temptation will I now Commence. From Tarsus round the lovely bay, Up which the eastern horn of Cyprus points, I journeyed slowly; every week and month Deepened the love of nature in my heart, Which seemed, like some angelic pioneer, Preparing the fresh path of grace divine, Softening the flinty rocks with gentleness That sapped all stubborn thoughts, all base desires, And bridging those dark chasms, which former sin, Like a wild earthquake, rent within the soul, By rainbows o'er whose braided arch new hopes Went on their way, as if on solid ground. In truth there is a sad congruity Between the landscape and the fate of those Exhausted realms;âa wild and touching waste Of sweetness, and a languid colouring. A pensive air of pastoral loneliness, With a monotony of change, through sun And moon or by the infrequent shower conferred. The pale green plains lie stretched in radiant mist, Diversified, one knows not how, and cheered By softness, almost mournful, of the lights And shades which chronicle the morn and eve, The summer and the winter, of those lands;â Regions of dappled shadow far outspread, Thrown from the mute procession of the clouds, Or by the slanting sun from caps of hill Projected, or historic barrows green, Or our own horses, dimly magnified, Reflected over many a rood of sward! And, if we lie upon the ground to sleep, How strangely o'er the surface of the earth There comes a floating sound, a homeless voice, Low as the creaking of a sullen moss, From the crisp browsing of the countless herds For a wide circuit round, by thrilling breeze Or happy sound of labour undispersed! And yet not unrelieved these pallid wastes By gentler or more stirring prospect: oft A range of olive-spotted slope is seen, Like tented camp of Arabs, and as black As the cold sea beneath a thundercloud, But now and then by momentary winds Quickened and driven in silver-twinkling waves;â Lone straggled palms with knotched and ruined stems Leaning or straight, the poplars of the East, So would I name them, giving to the view Its salient points, and sky-ward shooting spires Mosque-like, with slight o'erhanging cupolas, Partitioning the landscape here and there, Grateful relief unto the gazing eye, Like our tall foliaged pillars of the West, Most beautiful but shadow-grudging trees;â A floating dome of flat-topped pines far off, An underwood of shrubs that drop sweet gums, A pool obscure within a formal blind Of lentisk, or with crimson eyelids closed Of oleander,âeach for lack of change Is noted as a feature in the scene, And gives perchance a date unto the day. And oft a fallen column freshens thought, With flutings tightly clothed in yellow rust, And tufts of thyme are sheltered by its bulk And grow more tall than elsewhere, and the screen Of its broad shaft the lazy tortoise loves, And the green lizard with its throbbing pulse Sleeps in the heated marble grooves all day. Marvel not, holy father, that I speak In this calm way of nature's tranquil scenes, And local adjuncts on my memory worn By lapse of years, though now the narrative Is trembling on the threshold of my crime. My faltering tongue, reluctant to advance, Like urchins who forget their tasks, repeats And lingers on its words, as loath to leave That Asiatic landscape, where it quits The innocent sunshine of my life for ever. The horror and amazement of fresh guilt Have passed long since, and in the quiet depths Of my collected conscience I discern My sin tenfold more hateful than before. Yet, through the usage of my thoughts, that act Disturbs not now the adjacent memories. O father, terrible are those fierce hours, When our whole lives into one damning sin, One palpable spot of blackness, are confused, O'er-whelmed with a monotonous wretchedness, Where sorrow, tears, and prayers, aye even remorse, Are suffocated in the heart by blind And general anguish; and our mortal hopes, Those vitals of the soul, are by despair Held under water till they perish. Oh How oft would I have wooed those hours once more With hearty choice, so much less terrible Than the self-recollection which ensued! Father! the fast and vigil, midnight prayer And hymn at sunrise, which make up thy life, Are mysteries far too pure to teach thee how To fathom that abyss of mortal sin. Penance for slighted fast, or ill-said Hours, For broken silence, contumacious word Against the holy Abbot ere thyself Wert raised to that high office,âthese can give No gage to measure penance such as mine. Fearful, I say, as were those desperate hours When blood was wet upon meâOh my God! What infinite, insufferable curse The purity of Thy dread Presence seemed, When by degrees the vapours of my soul, The exhalations of my conscience, grew, Self-gathered, into one consistent orb, One tangible and separate shade, from which The speed of phrensied thought could never clear me, Nor would it overshoot me if I lagged Behind. Ah! then it was, and not till then My sin became my persecutor. Monk! My penance hath not been in loneliness, In the abhorrence of my kind, in want Of the best consolations of our faith,â But in the singleness of all my thoughts, The concentration of my harassed mind Upon one frightful action, and the strain Of an unshifting pressure so intense It is a miracle, of purpose wrought Perchance as penal, reason hath not cracked Beneath the agonizing tension; this, Yea, this hath been the intolerable curse, To be from my own nature thus outlawed Into the solitude of one dark thought. The excommunication of the Church, If this world only measured its results, But feebly shadows forth the length and breadth Of that abiding and familiar hell, Which for some years of sojourn in the East Was nourished like a loathsome bird of prey Upon my life of lacerated thought. But pardon meâI wander from my tale, And it behoves that thou shouldst hear the end. Amid such scenes and after such a day As those of which I spokeâah! I rememberâ A marble column prostrate, and encased In pale discolouring of saffron rust, And a green lizard sleeping in the grooves With sensual enjoyment of the heat, And with a little pulse that would outstrip The notes of nightingales for speedâeven that Was the last image of serenity Impressed upon my mind by earth and air, Responded to by inward happiness. I rode towards Antioch on that summer eve; Nigh to the column with a sudden swerve The road bore to the left; for half a league Straight o'er an odorous level it was stretched Like a blue thread, a level carpeted With pink-eyed thyme and with a pale green turf, All blent and intermingled in their hues, Each muffling each, as though with sweet design. Then o'er a hill, with golden cytisus And brittle cactus overgrown, I passed, And thence I could discern a glistering light Far o'er the plain, which might or might not be The domes of Antioch: now with steep descent The hill dropped down into a cedarn glade, With murmurs from an unseen river filled. Heaven is my witness not a single thought Detached from that exciting prospect round Rose in my heart, no bitterness of love, No keen awakening of my ancient wrongs. Amid the foliage, answering to the breeze With dusky dipping fans, I watched with joy Patches of sunset gold which wandered on From stem to stem, like creatures made of light. When, thus illuminated, I beheld, Asleep, alone, among some knotted roots, Ethilda's foster-brother, Athelstan, The puny stripling whose effeminate grace And most unknightly book-lore she preferred To me whose brow was swart with martial toils, And whose rough wisdom was acquired in camps, In travel, in the falsehood of a court, And masculine encounter with the world. To a snapped bough of cedar did I tie My weary horse, and stole to where he slept. I vow there was no thought of dark revenge Inciting meâfor he had wronged me not, The wrong was hers;âbut curious impulse, joined With fascination, as I now perceive, And a foul tempting motion, led me on. And there he lay, a seeming boy in years, With limbs by far too delicate to wear Aught but a silken doublet and soft hose, In lieu of steel accoutrements: his head Was pillowed on the convex of his shield; His flaxen hair was ruffled by the wind. He looked a child who now was sleeping off The weariness of play; and kindliness Might move me rather to set forth to seek His horse which strayed somewhere about the wood, Lest I should see him weeping when he woke. Then a chance sunbeam passed upon his face: He stirred not, but he smiled as if the light Wove itself in the texture of his dreams: He must have had the conscience of a child! I took my fill of gazing on the youth; And then the forced confession which I made Unto myself that he was beautiful, And for his very beauty could have loved him Even as a brother, goaded my hot heart To bitterness and rage; it was a joy Then to recall how I had hated him: And memory, by some marvellous influence helped, Some strange possession, did accumulate The past so vehemently on that point Of present time, so darkly magnified The frightful opportunity, that Iâ In sooth his beauty stirred me to it firstâ Slewâmurderedâbutchered him, alone, asleep, Unhelmed, and with his beauty pleading for him O so eloquently!âcaitiff that I was, No knight, I slew him as I would not slay A godless Saracen in open field. Father! his soul passed very easily,â Like a young child's, who is but born to pay His debt of death within an hour: so well He made surrender of his innocence Unto his Maker, passing from his sleep Into the sweet tranquillity of death. I saw him dieâO can my guilty soul Be disencumbered peacefully as his?â A marvellous gentle passage! there I gazed; My deed had utterly disarmed my heart. He rolled once round and buried his pale face In the soft earth, moaned once, and strove to clasp His nerveless hands in attitude of prayer; Then with an effort turned upon his back, And crossed his hands upon his breast in sign Of faith which persevered unto the last. I watched him from behind a cedar trunk: Whose hand it was that dealt the guilty blow He never knew. O father! human words Here sink beneath the burden of my tale. That hourâthe horror of that hourâbut list! I will relate it as I can. I gazed Upon my victim, dead, quite stark and dead, But, save some stains upon his cheek acquired When he convulsively embraced the earth, His whole appearance was of one who slept, His beauty pale, a smile upon his face, As though, in the most calm solemnity Of that last passage, there had come to him A sweet glimpse onwards, an unearthly smile, The attractive welcome upon dead men's lips Greeting perchance some fair angelic sight Then drawing near,âso mystical the smile! Father! what I shall say may seem too strange By one of guileless ways to be believed. There is a mental surge within the heart Of one just fresh from some atrocious crime, Inspiriting as sights of stormy sea, And breeding in the hour of recent guilt, If not a joy, yet a bewilderment Not far from joy, wherewith the soul is flown With sin, as men in search of reckless thought Are flown with wine, and have some happiness In mere oblivious stupor of the heart, Or gaiety insane: and even the sound, The strife, the passionate tumult of the mind Can minister relief, and by the time That the excitement of the sin cools down, The fact hath grown familiar to our thoughts, And therefore is less terrible by half. But I had no such lot: my jealous hate, Whose sudden impulse drove me to the crime, Ebbed out from every harbour of my thoughts, From every secret fold within my heart, With force as sudden as the influx was When I was gazing at him in his sleep. I had no refuge in excitement, no Self-justifying passion, no remains Of sin's original heat: my being was With an amazing magic dispossessed Before that beautiful dead face. Good Monk! I doubt not thou hast known how oft the world Within the heart of man doth stand rebuked Before the stately presence of a corpse, The spiritual magnificence of death: How it casts out all worldliness, the lust Of life and animal spirits, and can woo Unto the surface of our feelings, thoughts, And acts, whate'er within us may be found Of goodness; such constraining sanctity Flows from the tranquil vision of the dead. I leaned against the cedar trunk, and gazed On Athelstan: one little purple spot Upon his bosom, where he had unbraced His mail, was all the sign of violence. And, as I gazed, my hatred was expelled By love, yea, even by actual power of love Exorcised,âlove, not pity; for I glowed With all the fervour of a living love. But oh the agony of soul! the fire, The scorching fire which that love was to me! The worst enhancing of my wretchedness, The last extremity of punishment,â I loved him whom I murdered, and methinks Cain's very burden were less hard to bear. O wondrous transmutations of the soul, Wondrous as sudden, incident to those, And those alone, who with heroic deeds Or crimes of giant stature have conversed! How oft by you have Martyrs at the stake Been visibly transfigured to the form And look of Angels, while to me that night The transformation of my rage to love So operated as to be the flail Of some new passion, fiercer than remorse, Now to its awful function summoned up, A demon without name, to make a scourge Of my own damning thoughts, severer far Than if 'twere braided of the fires of hell, Wherein the bodily suffering might beâ So seemed it then to my most foolish thoughtsâ Faint mitigation of the pangs of soul. The night that followedâoh! how placidly The moon rose up above the wilderness, The bold expanse of sylvan solitude, While the dead features grew obscure, a spot Of ghostly whiteness on the dull brown earth! Upon a point projecting from the hill Halfway in the descent, I stood; and thence How beautiful the aspect of the night, Looking towards Antioch, whose far-gleaming spires Twinkled, like stars surmounting the pale line Of the horizon, or about to sink Beneath! The cedars in steep terraced lines One o'er the other into contact came, With foliage shelving like a skilful roof Of close continuous green all down the slope. And in and out with dusky-flashing wings The white owls sallied from the branching eaves, And, disappointed with the clear midnight, Screamed, and forthwith immured themselves again Within the vaults of umbrage: far and wide Thereon the silver darkness of the moon With an etherial paleness overspread The silent sea of boughs, while at my feet, Whither with momentary impulse fell My fascinated eyes, young Athelstan Lay stiffening in the dew, o'er canopied By sable cedars, most funereal trees, Whose fits of dirgelike music were evoked By calls of breezy air throughout the night. Whether by sleep o'erpowered or gradual swoon I know not, but the chill of dawning day Aroused me lying by the rigid side Of the pale corpse; and, slowly gathering thought, I mustered one by one the horrid facts Of the past night, till realizing all I summed it upâI was a murderer,â And the whole breadth of that tremendous word Was then disclosed unto my dizzy sense,â A dark blood-guilty spirit in the eye Of the sweet sunrise,âon the odorous earth Exiled from peace, another outcast Cain. In the keen horror of my soul I shrieked,â A long, loud, wailing scream of agony. The unearthly sound, received into the wood, Reverberated in the dim ravines, And echoed wildly from the sun-touched crags, While o'er the cedar tops at once there rose A miserable murmur of cold wind, Responsive, as it seemed, to the despair Within my heart: so awfully it preached That mercy was not, and all hope forsworn. I rose and fled; the stricken antelope, That from the arrow fixed within his side Flies, as he deems, in blind direction urged This way and that, scours not in worse dismay The dewy woodland, or with wilder speed, Than I now shot among the cedarn glades, The sunny openings and the darksome groves, With preternatural strength sustained, and spurred By those intolerable thoughts which rung, Like hunter's bugles in the affrighted ear Of the poor beast, within my conscious soul, A larum whose dread echo to this day, By mercy somewhat muffled, vibrates still. Yet was I destined never to outstrip That vile intolerable self, from which I ran: and yet the idle bodily act, While it illustrated the inward mind, No less relieved the agony; I ran, How long I know not, but until my foot Was caught amid some snaky roots which rose In treacherous moss, and to the earth I fell Senseless; my forehead dashed against a trunk With scaly rind as hard as plates of mail, And by my blood made ruddier than before. When consciousness returned I found myself Upon a pallet in an empty cave. A screen of ancient cedars grew in front, And pendulous before the entrance hung,â A pleasant lattice, whose dusk umbrage threw O'er all the spacious chambers of the rock A tinted twilight of aerial green, A gentle semi-lunar atmosphere; And then, although the sun had barely set, Were visible in trimly ordered spires The enwoven dances of the sparkling flies, Which there, when day hath hardly died without, Their nightly feast of lanterns celebrate. And to the cave, with resonance subdued, Vanquished with climbing up the woody height, The muffled thunder of a double fall Of foamy waters reached, an undersong Slowly surmounting every other sound As the night deepened, and the tingling earth With all her voices into slumber sunk, All save the jackal's cries, which overhead Like plaining infants wearied the still air. Parting the cedar boughs, which at my touch Swung lightly on one side, I left the cave. The paradise of Daphne lay around. In front there was a cirque of emerald lawn, With cypress fringed, whose motionless black spires Seemed molten in the scintillating gold And throbbing saffron of the western sky; And tortuous paths of ruddy gravel glowed With a coarse gilding mid the luminous green Of wide-spread myrtles and old towering bays; While down below, above the panting falls, The oily waters glistened mid the boughs, Like a marsh meteor creeping through the grove. And on a lower shelf in laurel trees Embowered, that might from Julian count their years, Stood the half-ruined shrine of Babylas, The Decian Martyr who erewhile repelled, Bold as the Saint of Milan, from the doors Of Antioch Church, the master of the world; Whose holy relics in Cremona now Are honoured by the faithful of the West. O marvellous it was that night to see The trickling moonlight sweetly overflow Those hoary laurels, down from leaf to leaf Dripping like noiseless rain, ascents and falls And running tremours of fair light that seemed Like pictured music, as when we behold For hours, and wonder what defrauds the ear, How Saint Cecilia's taper fingers sweep With flying pressure the white twinkling keys, Chanting her everlasting, silent psalm! The loud clear voices of the singing birds That trilled down every rock and cedar stem, Before the sunrise, woke me in the cave: And with a slow return upon my ear, The water-fall resumed its soothing sound. I stepped beyond the screen of fanlike boughs; And for a moment, O how beautiful, And how divinely calm the place appeared,â The smile of expectation dimpling there On leaf and stone, as veins of pearly light, The out-runners of the morning, blanched the skies. But swift the recollection of my sin Rushed like a torrent back upon my thoughts, And dashed the gentle sense of joy away. Ah sinful world, and I of sinners worst, How have ye marred the primal bliss of earth, Since happiness a mournful-visaged power Appears, when loveliest; and the winning charm Of innocence and chastity consists In unavenging weakness, while the thought Of wrong, which in our mind accompanies The vision of a pure and guileless man, Invests with pitiful pathetic light That innocence, acknowledged and beheld Strong as the sunrise in the world above, As though wrong were the inseparable shade Of virtue, helpless foreigner on earth! Now, from a cave hard by, an agÃ¨d man Came forth, and greeted me with blunt address. Stranger, said he, I saved thy life: thy steed, Which from the cedar bough had broken loose, By the west gate of Antioch foaming stood, There recognized, and while debate was held Among the guards, the jennet of the man Thou slew'st came neighing to the self-same gate, And riderless; the Latin knights who went Into the forest on a mournful quest, For so they deemed it, found thy bloody sword, And knew it thine by graving on the hilt, Near the cold corpse, dishonourably pierced Where the cuirass had been unbraced for sleep. And at this hour in Antioch's dungeons dark Wouldst thou have been, abiding axe or wheel, Had I not promptly brought thee to this cave, Where jealously immured thou must remain Awhile, though free of this sequestered lawn; For a rich price is set upon thy head. I stood before him silent and dismayed By those scant words, that bloodless summing up, That frozen unimpassioned narrative, With no reproach, no bitterness or scorn Commingled; such commingling would have been Relief, and fortified endurance more. And by the aspect of the man was I No less amazed, than by his frigid speech. His long thin hair was all of silvery white, His back was bent with age, his lean left-hand Trembled with palsy, like a shivering leaf. His brow and face were wrinkled o'er and o'er, Dinted with lines of pain; his bloodless skin With a strange olive whiteness was o'erspread, Like leprosy; but on his sunken eyes The power and brilliance of extremest youth Were throned, in sleepless glances darting forth, And with a fearful beauty, from their caves, Deep in the head, o'er-ruling all the age Of his wan lineaments; and from his mouth, Toothless and fallen in, came forth a voice Tuneful and clear, with intonation firm Yet flexible, most like the tones of one Out-growing fast the service of the choir, And domineering in the boyish chant. Dreadful it was to gaze upon his face And hear that voice come forth, so young, so sweet; As though a second spirit had possessed That old and crippled frame, investing it With double being,âa gaunt half-ruined cell, From out whose fissures songlike oracles With ringing clearness were for ever breathed. And strange it was that those decrepid limbs, That palsied hand, those numb and tottering feet. Should have conveyed me thither in my swoon. More like a dream-engendered shape he was Than living man of mortal parentage; As though we had in some hot starting sleep, Or stupour by the healing poisons wrought, Beheld in feverish vision Youth and Age, Two disembodied spirits, dimly fight For some pale corpse which they would fain possess, And each, alternately victorious, fill The passive thing with cognizable life, Now young, now old, or old and young at once. I stood in awe and trembling, silence-bound, While he, divining all my inward thought, Answered my questioning eyes;âI am the Jew, The Wandering Ancient, through all centuries known, Reluctant Pilgrim, tarrying on the earth; The startling shadow of whose life is cast Across all generations of mankind; And this the witness of my destiny. So saying, from out his vest of serge he drew His strong right hand, with roseate flesh of youth Well furnished, and full veins and agile nerves, Which ill accorded with his shrunken wrist;â And for what cause, said he, my voice and eyes And this bold hand with such immortal youth And freshness bloom, I need not now recite; Methinks thy first conjecture scarce could fail To unriddle that wide-blazoned mystery. I am a wandering planet that might seem, Save to that all-discerning Eye above, Without an orbit, free to roam the skies In desultory pilgrimage, self-willed,â But that I feel a silent light wells out For ever from my presence, so that men Instinctively retreat before me, abashed, Making my road a transient solitude In populous cities or the throng of camps. And thus I know that some mysterious law Is hung discernibly about my life. And once in every age my lonesome thoughts Are by the hateful presence scourged anew Of Christian fallen into mortal sin, Who tortures me with Signs that rend my flesh, Like the hot beaks of vultures, and by woe, By self-abasement, and repenting tears, One drop of which were cheaply bought by me For all the world contains of gold or gems: And while my sufferings are enhanced, his soul Beneath the infliction of my presence wins A penance I reluctantly accord, And through a broken spirit meets with grace. Demas was first, and thou art doomed the twelfth. Seven years I dwelt, seven years of length untold, Unspeakable, of life precipitate, Crowded experience, savage wanderings, Successions of unnatural toils, compressed In those few dismal moons,âseven mortal years Of expiatory sojourn with the Jew. Solemn it was to see the mystic lot Of the dark homeless people gathered up And hung upon that single living type. Stirring or still, before his sleepless eyes, Stood the most heavenly Vision of a Face, Such as doth nightly haunt the troubled dreams, Or desolate misgivings in the day, Of the poor Hebrew nation, which even now Floats like a buoyant wreck that cannot sink Upon the surface of the awe-struck world, Paynim or Christian: a dread Vision too, The Guiltless whom they nailed upon the Cross, Which they who gaze on, in deep love or hate, Endure the one affection in their souls Deathless; as on the Wanderer's eyes it forced Constrained acceptance of a joyless youth. And evermore the Personal Vision gained Vivid similitude the more intense As years were heaped upon him, till it grew Like forms conglobed within the lurid heart Of the black thunder-storm, the brazen orb Of the red lightnings partly disengaged From its restraining canopy of cloud. And, woful curse less tolerable still! The Monarch of the loathsome Powers of Air, Darkness, and Evil, seemed unto his eyes (As unto others it may be, immersed In long habitual sin, or unto bards Profanely dreaming over songs instinct With hatred of the Very Son of God, Unholy men and reprobate) not foul, Grossly deformed and hideously grotesque, Monstrous, mis-shapen, a contorted growth Of the foul limbs of unclean animals, From which the Benediction was removed Through some mysterious trespass, for even thus The faithful generations of the Saints And their wise art have taught usâbut the Foe, The Antagonist of Light, of perfect Good, Of Wisdom, and Supreme Beneficence, Seemed in the eyes of that accursÃ¨d man A starry Form, a Satan beautiful, Of visage marred, yet glory beaming through, Wondrous, if not delectable,âof grand And regal intellect, and equipage Of archangelic faculties, still soaring Up to the sunlight, still to be admired Of mortal man, though haply recognized Of lagging wing, celestial now no more: Bidding the mind of sinners to discern A majesty where God's own written curse Hath vilified the Creature evermore, And stooped to name him with His blessÃ¨d Lips, In love, for our behoof, the Sire of Lies. O never may the leprosy of song Like this beguile the sons of God to deem, That aught of true sublimity consists, Where truth is not, where hate hath wedded fear, And ambush is the sole permitted power; As if there could be Greatness so divorced From Goodness, Beauty where there was not Love, Or Wisdom with a Disobedient Spirit! Now for the first four years our travel ranged In narrow compass, mid the icy spears Of Taurus, or of Antilibanus That looks on moonlit Balbec, or beyond Amid the quiet and conventual glades, The pastured slopes and green declivities Of Carmel, by the soft sea-murmurs filled, As if by voices of innumerous bees, And backward to the cedar mountains, where The sunlit beacon of the Sannin flames Toward Cyprus, still returning to our cave From time to time in Daphne's laurel groves. But ere we entered our fifth spring the Jew Related that in every seventh year He had a penal mission to fulfil Far off amid the Helvetian Alps, a toil For which he must ordeal journey make First mid the horrors of the Caucasus, Which dreadful pilgrimage I now must share. Good Abbot! there are men alive on earth With most o'erwhelming functions to perform, And lives embraced by wizard destinies; And solitudes where awful things are wrought, And voices uttered in the dead of night, And old wierd cities guarded by a curse, And lakes and oceans, which the moon beholds, Outside the confines of all natural laws,â Marvels and apparitions, far and near, Which men in quiet places reck not of, Yet haply touch or see, all unawares. Father! methinks our fears might worship earth, And not unduly, for her regions have Some fearful consecrations: and how small, How poor a portion of her realms doth man Inhabit! Yet within his city walls, No less than o'er the howling wilderness, What haughty Powers of Evil domineer, In separate spots, from age to age, allowed To make their flashing sceptres visible, A moment visible; then in the gloom Is their regalia folded up again, Sparing the affrighted sense of mortal man. The earth of maps and charts, of signs and names, Veils of imaginary curves and spots, Ill cover that uneasy earth below. Such was the dread Ordeal of the Jew;â Waftedâif such an uncouth errantry Can mate so soft a wordâabove his kind, Above the world of men and visible life, And in suspension held above all joys, All loves, and that variety of fears Which peril life's enjoyment, and through hope Enhance it tenfold,âand yet diving oft, By fate constrained, into that nether world, Which agitates the surface of our own, And with a viewless interference breaks The equable procession of its laws. Thither, as if the ground beneath his feet At destined times gave way, the Hebrew sinks; And, thence emerging, floats above the earth Once more, like some low-hanging cloud that clings Above the tree-tops of a wooded plain, As though it loved the earth, yet might not lie Upon its household farms and fields, or like The jealous waters of a virgin stream Which with its crystal lance may pierce the lake, And issue from it uncommingled,âso The Jew, sinking and re-ascending, blends With our sweet intervenient world no more. Hear the strange legend which he told me: thou Better than simple layman wilt discern, If such a tale have warrant in the faith. There is a lake upon a western Alp, A field of fenny waters, not a mere Of crystal delicately lit by flowers, That gaze into its mirror, and dilute Their rainbow shadows in its liquid depths, Nor by a marge of lucent sward enclosed; But a broad swampy place, with toppling crags Leaning across and barring the blue sky From imaging itself upon the pool. And there, imprisoned in the chilly ooze, Lies the poor spirit of the faltering Judge, The wicked wavering Pilate, who, consigned By an itinerant exorcist there, When he had troubled long the woods and cliffs And shepherds' walks, doth issue once a year, And he who meets him on the mountain side Dies for a surety ere twelve moons have waned. Goaded by keen remorse that Unjust Judge Fled from his province to the capital, But by a constant vision of the Cross Pursued. If in the morning he would greet The CÃ¦sar rising with the sun to wait The adulation of his subjects, there Pilate beheld a Cross. In dreams by night, In changing scenes of travel, in the clouds, The scintillating centre of the sun, The quiet freckled aspect of the moon, The white phosphoric fields of summer sea Heaving against the moles of BaiÃ¦, still In every time and place he saw the Cross, The Cross on Calvary, and brooking not This persecution of the sacred Sign, He slew himself, as Judas did before. But earth disdained and loathed his sepulture, And with an effort panted forth his corpse. Then, far into the yellow Tyber flung, The stream was troubled with incessant storm, Broke down the bridges, swamped the passage boats, Until there was no ferry left in Rome. Thence was the body taken, by command Of CÃ¦sar and the Senate, to a hill Which overlooks the Rhone hard by Vienne. There did they dig a monstrous uncouth pit Upon the peak, and tumbled massive rocks Upon the turbulent corpse; forthwith the storm Burst on the mountain-top with fiery bolts, And fulmined over Dauphiny, and far To Languedoc, and summits of Auvergne; Behind, the poor Savoyards heard or saw The maddened echoes of their native hills Shake the wild eagles from their thrilling nests, And with the pulses of fierce beating sound Unrivet there the rock-bound avalanche. The body, disinterred once more, now gained A sepulchre within the fretting Rhone: Forth with the waters rose into the streets, Stood cubits high within the temples, sucked The statue of old Jove within their waves, Tore up the mulberry groves, and, foaming, went, A solid wall of crested waters, down To Valence, and the swampy flat of Arles, Spreading a sudden lake from thence to Nismes. Thus did the river tyrannize from year To year, until the days of Charlemagne,â The greatest man of all the modern world, Who in his day encountered marvellous things, And, more than mortal, bore the Cross as none Had borne it yet; he bade them drag the Judge From out the noble river, and once more Inter the body on a gloomy Alp That overlooks a lake, a lucid Cross (The Apparition constant to its post) Of sunny waters glittering in the eye Of that dark mountain, whose wild woods and cliffs, As I have said, he troubled with his cries, Until a holy monk, who chanced to pass Among the wailing people of Lucerne, Laid him beneath that dull and ruffled mere, There visited and horribly evoked In every seventh year by that lone Jew, Who for the dread encounter doth anneal His spirit mid the warring elements, The furnace of mysterious sights and sounds Within the Caucasus of Astracan. BOOK IX. THE ABSOLUTION. Three years we wandered, pilgrims, now on foot And now on horseback, and sometimes we joined A caravan of traders, but more oft Were by ourselves, and with infrequent speech Beguiled the way; companions, not from choice,â From loathsome fascination on my side, On his from a desire, as it appeared, (Much as he said which sounded otherwise,) To inflict his presence on me, and a joy At my repugnance, manifested oft By look and word and gesture of disdain, Or of impatience rather, for was I A man who could find aught so far below him As might appear an object of disdain? We left our cavern in the cedar groveâ Methinks I see the firefly columns now Build and unbuild their wizard temples there On the soft verdant gloom;âwe left our cave Ere spring had breathed upon the sward, or swelled The bulb of wild flowers, or had studded yet The cedar boughs with emerald points minute, The promise of the year, a scanty growth Of paler green, that looks like powdered dust, Upon those long-lived trees. A sinuous course We took, a Cainlike penance which the Jew With an intolerable waywardness Determined, unopposed; for I was fain Alway to recognise the Hand of Heaven Guiding my punishment, in that self-will Wherewith the fearful man to right or left Swerved ever from his purpose oft declared. First o'er the hills we reached Samosata, Where old Euphrates elbows to the west, And thence to Orfa and MosÃ¹l; northward Across the Tigris to that lake immense Of Van, and Urmia in the hills enclosed Of green AderbijÃ n, till from the shore Of gloomy Astara we saw outspread The misty Caspian. After sojourn here, Unto the Steppe of Urgantz we took sail, And mid the ruined towns and swampy lakes Of the rude Usbecks wandered wearily, Sick of the loathsome diet and wild ways Of that gaunt region. Thence, the Oxus past, Unto the dreary desolate Karak By Sihon's triple streams we journeyed on, Coasting the sea of Aral in and out By indentations choked with islands lone, Which the foul seabirds tenant; and once more Turned westward o'er the fenny wilderness, Rounding the head of Caspian o'er the sands Of Oural unto Astracan, who sits In her barbarian splendour on the mouths Of the dark-watered Volga. Thence we roamed O'er populous Circassia to the steeps Of dreadful Caucasus, and tarried there Mid sights and sounds terrific, day and night. O Father! were it well, I could reveal This day appalling mysteries endured Within the hollow Caucasus, where reign The elements chaotic as at first, And shapeless solitudes, and brutes of eld, And shades deformed, and voices all uncouth! There day and night keep not nor recognize Divine partitions, while the storms and beasts, Outbellowing each other, overwhelm The heart of man with horror and dismay, And yet less dreadful than the oppressive calms, Which with a pregnant silence most enhance The unearthly character of that wild chain, By wondering humanity of old Selected as the theatre whereon The man, unrighteously benevolent, His curse, magnificently fabled, bore, By the contagious voice of poets sung. Enough that in the cold and heat, both fierce And direful, of that jaggÃ¨d Caucasus, And its sepulchral glens of cloud-bleached rock, I passed with but indifferent success A hard ordeal; yet should I have been More calm but for the presence of the Jew, Which heightened every horror of the place, As though it did impersonate the fiend, Outcast seducer of poor sinning men. Spirit of Earth! that, like an empress, keep'st Thy court amid the labyrinthine dells, The caverned cloisters and old beetling pines Of Caucasus! how didst thou entertain Us two with savage hospitality, Terrific splendours, and portentous shows Of jousting elements! What wondrous scenes And wild processions ever meet and mix Within that spacious hall, where dwell the kings Of nature, and the bodied elements, And phantom-flashes of unbodied powers, Such as the spirit of the cloudless calms,â All unpartitioned, as loud chaos was, Unsorted by the musical constraint Of that old spoken Law, the primal Voice! Ah! woe is me for that unresting Jew, With body wrenched and broken on the wheel Of endless travel, with unbroken pride, Unbroken hatred of the BlessÃ¨d Christ! I see him, yea, I see him at this hour, Within the confines of this chapter-house: In my far-kenning spirit I behold The Hebrew pacing onward, mid the spasms Of earthquake, in whose volumes of white dust The low-hung moon looks red, while scarce on high The comet shakes its long pale crackling hairs In terrible proximity to earth. Round him the whirlwinds bark among the glens, And cry like bloodhounds on a human track, Through DalestÃ n: and in the sullen dawn Of those Caucasian depths I see him still. The dizzy lightnings glare, above, beneath, Grazing the rocks with horrible rebound, And flashing in the bright sun's lidless eyes, While the hot bolts from out the hissing lakes With momentary plunge heave up on high Columns of angry foam: I see the veins Of the old earth beneath the torture start Of stern volcanoes, in their chambers sunk, Questioning the greedy hills till they confess Their riches, and the gold and silver runs Among the subterranean floors, whose roots Of livid marble crack with grasping fire, From the hill tops to those enduring bars Which Jonas saw beneath the clear green sea. I see his shadow on the tawny plains, Freckled with frost-rime of perennial salt, Of desert Khiva, on the horizon marked Colossal, half on earth and half in air, Against the flaming chambers of the west, Where the wild sky unloads its wains of clouds Into the setting sun, as one who feeds A greedy fire, which, blazing up, out-throws, As the new fuel falls upon the old, Thick swarms of ruddy sparks, and, far and wide, Splashes of flame, as from a fountain, flings, That reach in falling streaks the backward east: I see him there, as if about to step From off earth's rim into the setting sun. I see him in the strange ethereal calms, Those intermissions of discordant wind, When the white-shafted frost goes forth to shoot The lamp-like globes of the descending dew; And thin blue meteors sail along the rims Of rosy avalanches, shrinking now, Now touching with a crisp and gentle sound The icy fringe; while ever and anon An old snow-laden cedar softly shakes Its stiff black hair, and countless whirling stars, A whispering shower of stealthy parachutes, Sink to the earth; and still, and still, far on Where mist-wreaths, like a crimson-wrinkled sea At sunset, steal along the quiet glens, I see the Figure, dimly magnified By roseate vapours, of the steadfast Jew. For even thus I wandered with him once Through DalestÃ n, and over Caucasus. And thence descending, by Telav, we came To Erivan, and in another week Beheld the sun set over Ararat. And there with impious foot the Hebrew strove To climb the sacred mountain's double cone, And reach the undecaying Ark which lies, By Angels guarded, on the dazzling peak. Once with a bold yet not presumptuous faith, And an exceeding reverence for the Ship, The inland Ship which was unto our race A second Edenâhow unlike the first!â Whence as from out a well the tribes of men Flowed forth afresh,âonce with such venturous faith A monk essayed to climb the mystic hill In honour of that Sign, most worshipful And wondrous of all relics on the earth, Except the Gracious Wood by Helena Found, and self-multiplied, and so dispersed Throughout the compass of the East and West, Like broken bread, to hearts that hungered for it. But ever while the monk lay down to sleep, Wearied by his long toil, with noiseless arms Angels convey'd him to the mountain foot; And he full oft renewed his patient course. At length in pity for the footsore man A Spirit monished him to lay aside His rude emprise, while for his simple heart Rich guerdon he received, a piece of wood From off the unreached Ark, a holy prize At Etschmiadsin by the Primate kept, Honoured with incense and liturgic song. I need not tell how that mysterious cone Baffled the Hebrew with its steep ascent Seven times repeated. While the convent bells Summoned Arguri's monks to early Mass, We left the glittering Ararat behind; And thence across the variable charms Of hill and dale through all the Armenian coasts, Until by Malazkerd and Erzeroum We came at length unto the shrubby shores Of Trebizond, the lover of the joust, By paynim champions from the soldan's court, The chivalry of rich Iconium, Frequented now, with ducal splendour gay By the Comnenian dynasty adorned. From Trebizond across the Euxine Sea We sailed to Feodosia, whence we climbed The hills to Arabat mid groves of date And old pomegranate trees, and wound our way Among the net work of innumerous lakes Which pierce that sweet peninsula from east Almost to Perekop upon the west Of Taurida; and through the mulberry plains Of Dnieper, with mysterious barrows sown, We journeyed to the cataracts that sound O'er vacant leagues of sombre treeless steppe, The chamber of the whirlwind, and descending We crossed the Cherson pastures, where the grass, Tall as a waving coppice, in the burst Of springtide suffocates the wandering flocks Caught unawares, and in its matted depths, Muffling the cry of torture, oft entombs The vainly struggling ram. Then taking ship In the salt inlets, a tempestuous voyage Brought our poor bark into the Bosphorus, And to the quays of Pera. Brief delay Detained us in the eastern capital, And thence by Adrianopoli we rode Unto Belgrade, the junction of the Save And yellow Danube, and far onward still, Over the fatal fields and oozy shores Where the wild Picard, all undaunted, led His hosts to perish by Hungarian swords, Unto imperial Passau came at last. And, thence abruptly turning to the north, We left the rolling Danube, and passed on Across Bohemia's dim and singular wolds, Wave after wave of huge and bulky swells, Uplands forlorn whose troubled silence moans With sounds as if of subterraneous winds, Whose hard-won island spots of yellow corn Upon the surface of the chilly soil, And long blue lines of ever-wailing fir, Enhance the bleak appearance of the land, Making the scene weigh heavy on the heart. Ah me! it is a melancholy sight To see the glory of the setting sun Squandered upon that bare disconsolate realm, Crowning with golden light the unwilling hills, While a wan smile, a momentary thought Of joy, by force illumes the dismal firs, And fades, while they redouble their sad sighs! The man, whose feet the purposes of life May chance to lead o'er those Bohemian downs, Should travel when the silent witching moon Floats up above the gloomy moors, and then Ruffles with argent light the mournful earth, Builds castles in the vacant fallow fields, Or from a miserable ruined grange,â Disperses to a minster's lordly breadth The village tower, and wildly magnifies Each single tree to an umbrageous grove, Peopling the midnight air behind the firs With hanging back-ground of voluptuous wood. Northward we went till, on a nodding rock Where the cold Moldau makes a lucid curve, We saw a glistering city perched on high, And covering half the crescent plain below. It looked no strong creation of the west, But in the sunshine fluttering like a dream Winged from some Asian lake or fairy shore Of Bosphorus, with sheeny spires o'ertopped, Turrets and gables, fretted balconies And grimly figured eaves, thin cupolas, A glorious bridge with its twin church-like towers, And palaces with blazing copper roofs, Where the proud Czeckian nobles keep their courts, And mid the moving sentries, silent ranks Of sculptured knights and pontiffs strangely blent, And starry vanes, a multitudinous show,â A mirage in the sunset, on those hills And barren uplands a reflection cast, So it appeared, by that all-seeing orb From oriental city viewed far off, Bagdad, or Tripoli, or Ispahan, O'er which his slanting beams had lately looked. The bells rang out, the sun with placid rim Behind the many-steepled Hradschin sunk, As we passed through the clanging gates of Prague. Thence to the right through many a sombre street We walked until we reached a place of graves, The Jewish burying ground with elders dank, Thick as the eastern cypress rows, o'ergrown. There were the pilgrim-people's sordid tombs, With native characters engraved; and bands Of Hebrew children played about the grove, That melancholy grove which might inspire Such sadness as befits a Jewish heart. There lay the sons of Aaron, symbolized By open palms whose rudely carven thumbs Rested upon each other; and alone, Beneath an old fantastic elder-trunk, A famous doctor slept, and all who passed Laid a small stone upon his shady tomb, Or copper coin, if haply they were rich. With mute obeisance, my companion placed A stone thereon, and when I followed close, Like reverence not according, a young boy, Of swarthy fairness and smooth oval brow, Stepped forth and with rude gesture seized my hand, While his black eyes with beautiful anger glowed, But a word, uttered in their native tongue By the old Jew, reproved the forward act. Thence, by a postern half engulfed in earth, We passed into a gloomy Synagogue, A domelike vault with nobly sculptured roof, Which in the uncertain twilight of the place Seemed on its centre to repose and swing With artful poise upon the pillared shafts. It was an ancient pile, and local faith Throws back its building into those far times, When on the Laurenzberg, where now the fires Of that true Martyr are by godly monks Extolled in rite and song, the idolaters Worshipped the fierce devouring element. With such kind wisdom on all dark beliefs The Church a better honour doth engraft, And wins the erring to a sweeter faith. Nay, mounting higher still, traditions tell Of Jewish worship on the Moldau bank Before the Almighty by the ensanguined hand Of Roman Titus tore the temple down From its tall rock, and marred the chosen Mount. In each embrasure and around the base Of the two pillars, lay unsightly heaps Of dust, which the laborious tide of time Had drifted there, and now were sacred held. Nine times the Jewish workmen had essayed To cleanse the building, and nine times had death Smitten the foremost of them to the ground. A gorgeous drapery, damp-stained, hung low Behind a dull red cresset, which had burned A hundred years, by wavering breath of air Still unextinguished, or by act of man. In this old Synagogue the Wandering Jew A vigil alway keeps, before he goes To that encounter by the ghastly lake On the dark out-post of the cloudy Alps. All night he knelt before the dusky veil, Which now and then the cold air gently shook; And all night long two Jews kept up a chant In under-tones, monotonous and sad, From side to side responsive in the dark. But when the sunrise stole with dismal grey Through the dim panes, they rose and bowing low Took from behind the veil a yellow scroll, An ancient writing of the Decalogue, And put it to the Wanderer's trembling lips. That selfsame morn once more across the downs We passed, and in six days of toilsome march Hailed the bright Inn at Passau once again, The glistening Inn, a lucid avenue With its impetuous waters mountain-born Meeting the Danube by St. Mary's Church: And thence between the river's wooded shores In a frail barge of uncompacted planks We stemmed the current up to Ratisbon. By this time, father, had a mighty change Come o'er my spirit; grief had been so long My fellow, and repentant thought my food, It pleased our Saviour to ungird the bands Of deep remorse which had so strangled hope. And not without some influence too had been The external world, with whose most rugged sights, And desperate adventures, I had closed In necessary combat, nor repined. And from the surface of the earth went up, Methought with somewhat of a healing force, A mist like that which in true Eden once Silently fertilized the flowery ground. Nor without virtue had that penance been,â The torture of the Jew's unresting eye, Among the cedars hard by Antioch borne, And by the lakes and Asiatic steppes, At sunrise on the hills, and at midnight, Least tolerable then, upon the sea. Whether it was indeed that heaven relaxed My penance at this season, or that change Diverted me with customary power, Or that the vision of the Christian West Wrought old associations to a balm, Fragrant and healing to a wounded heart,â Whatever lurking causes might concur, From that day forward did I feel convinced,â And O with what a sweet constraint it came And took possession of my willing faith!â That a new epoch had begun with me, A glimmering ray which might dawn into hope, But was not hope as yet. I can recall With pleased fidelity that evening scene, When with slow sail we came near Ratisbon. The banks were flat, and smiling fields outstretched Sparkling on either side with silvery green From recent showers, which fled as we advanced. Before us lay that old historic town Upon a back-ground of dark thunder-cloud, Pencilled with streaky spires of thin blue smoke, Which rose unsteady and dispersed. The towers Of the low-roofed cathedral in the heart Of the black cloud stood forth, each with a gleam Of whitest sunshine gloriously crowned. And o'er the antique bridge which nobly spans The hurrying river was a vision seen, A heavenly sign, a bridge above a bridge, A vaulted rainbow roof which overhung That old stone bridge, an arch of braided hues, Which from the centre of the city rose, And dropped its bright foundations on the bank Exactly where the stern portcullis kept The northern access of the town. Ah me! Fair, very fair, seemed Ratisbon that night: The very walls wave-worn, and battlements Lofty and grim, an air of welcome had, And on the casements of the Rathaus glanced The many-twinkling sunshine; all was sweet, And grateful to a heartsick wanderer, And to this hour I think of Ratisbon As though it were in some true sense my home. But for the presence of the hateful Jew, And the cold light of his indifferent gaze, That evening by the Danube would have been Even to a wretched sinner like myself A simple joy, a beauty undefiled. And not less gratefully does Ratisbon Rest with a cherished pressure of sweet thought On my remembrance, for that in its streets Unconsciously I parted from the Jew, And saw his face no more. Perchance it was His work with me was done, and in my heart Further collision now with such an one Might have unmanned my penitence. But oft My thoughts will wander to his awful lot. The world is evil; yet the worst of men Disclose unthought-of goodness to the hearts That know them best and converse with them most. Even in our enmities we may full soon Discern the growing truth,âthat knowledge feeds, Not lessens, our respect unto our kind: But it was not so with that blighted Jew. Father, it may be he is beating now Forlorn and footsore on the sleety steppe Of desolate Urgantz, or clinging fast, Till the blood oozes from beneath his nails, Unto a precipice in Caucasus, While the fierce whirlwind howls along the pass. O wretched mortal of unnumbered years, Blown by the breath of fate through heat and cold, And storm and calm, and by the fourfold curse Of seasons wrongly alternating scourged, How horrible thy path, how desolate The obscurity of ignominious scorn Which is thy portion, while upon the rack Of thine unearthly travel thou art whirled For ever o'er the heads of all thy kind, In fearful exaltation punished most! O wretched one, who dwellest in a sphere Where thou art all alone, who art not man, Angel, or devil, but art thus enclosed, In misery a species by thyself, Without a mate, without a kindred life, With a dead heart, but with a living soul, Living through wild excess of blind despair, If such a thing there could be as excess In that which neither end nor measure bound! O silent phantom, that in ghostly youth And bright-eyed age art borne about the earth, A momentary preacher, here or there Beheld and not forgotten, how dost thou Darken with some half palpable eclipse The traveller's way, a transitory gloom Strange as the figured shadows on the plain Cast in the starlight when no hills or trees Are nigh, a dusky dappled umbrage thrown From intermediate veils of grosser air! O sleepless Hebrew! journeying evermore, Who once or twice in every age appear'st, A spectral admonition of our faith, Before the quailing eye of Christendom, Exhausting now, but as an antepast Of woes severer far and hotter pains, A temporal eternity of grief, The agony of weary sleeplessness, The aching of unrespited fatigue,â How fearful is thy lot, when I who owe My life unto thy succour, dare not pray That thou mightst be unburdened now at length Of this most lone, most singular destiny! Then upon his departure there ensued A season of more tranquil thought, a calm Of recollection rather than of peace. The battling tumult of disordered hopes, The passionate collision of my fears, Slowly subsided, like the running sea When the wild storm hath ridden by; and then From out the turbulent confusion came, Sinking and reascending turn by turn, An undistinguishable form that rose And fell, and on the surface of my thoughts, Like a wrecked purpose, dimly weltering lay Far off, yet ever as it floated grew More palpable, until with formal pomp The apparition laboured into sight, Confronting me, a cognizable shape, Which in the listening silence of my heart Proclaimed itself a duty, whose behests Conscience uneasily discerned for law. It bade me seek the punishment ordained Of God for him by whom the blood of man Is shed, and whose exaction hath been laid A solemn burden, reverently endured, On human Law, the echo of God's Voice And Vicar of His Justice. Dark as seemed The mated solitude where I had dwelt, It was a respite from that awful doom, Which seals the strivings of the penitent. Not in the wildness of abandoned hope, Nor goaded by intolerable thoughts, Nor yet detected by my hideous crime Loathing the prison of self-consciousness, And peering through the surface of my speech,â Nor passively allured, as happens oft, By those regards, through conscience multiplied, Wherewith the eye of justice fascinates The guilty, and with incantation mute Attracts them to herself,âbut in the strength Of a submissive will and sacred fear, I journeyed onward to the English shore, Unshaken, nay, with terrors half appeased, And in the rectitude of my resolve Finding even somewhat of a trembling cheer. There is an awe, a most unsettling awe, Which yet unnerves not, in a bold resolve, Raising the animal spirits while it fills The soul with dim forebodings, half afraid Of such disclosure of its innate powers As gleams through one determinate deed of will, The solemn freedom of a Human Act! O when we bear in mind both what we are, And with whose Presence we are all enclosed, The freedom of the Human Will seems less A marvel than that we should dare to use That almost penal gift. A Human Act, Tied often to unending consequence, Seemingly self-attached to His decrees Who is immutable, and with a power Of making unborn ages mournful heirs Of its bequests, which may not be declined,â A Human Act, such as each solar day Begets in countless numbers,âwhat a force Resides therein, which superstitious fear Might well-nigh worship with its darkest rites! How strange is that deliberate cheerfulness Wherewith men act, who yet endure the sense That they are creatures, vilest property Of Him so far above them, and their lives No more their own than any outward thing! If there is baseness in self-will, no less Repugnant to self-sacrifice and faith Is an obedient sullenness, that mood Of discontented acquiescence bred In sterile natures by the uneasy thought, That we may not be masters to ourselves: And miserably guilty those bad hearts, Who, in the shade of their bedarkened wills Sitting their whole lives long, pretend to be Beneath the umbrage of Divine Decrees, The only humble of the sons of men! Father! such substance hath a Human Act That I have dreamed the Saints might haply see The sin of Adam in a bodily shape, A person, not a mere contagious thing; Yet pardon me! I must not dream to-day. How blest are they who, through baptismal doors Entering the Holy Church, can to the yoke And duty of the Creature superadd The self-forgetting heart of the Redeemed, And quiet courage of the Sanctified! And well may they, who see God can be touched With spiritual contact in His priests, Anticipate the Judgment, and rehearse For that solemnity, and so confess (Kneeling before the priest who disappears In faith's keen vision of her Priest on high) Their Human Acts, retaining undivulged Such deeds of good as not being wrought alone Are scarcely human; by this humbling pain, As by a holy ritual solemnized, Deposing all their actions in the light Of Omnipresence; seeking, not being sought, And so reversing that first guilty change In Adam's fall, his flight before the Voice Amid lost Eden's unavailing shades! Shame was the first fruits of the fall, and shame The matter of the Atonement, and to-day, To sweet Confession, as a vase, consigned, Shame is medicinal to us who sin, A natural reparation, yet divine, And in itself contains the healing Cross, Infecting it with supernatural power. O happy, happy they whom grace hath helped Unto an honest will, and who have nerved Themselves to this most salutary shame, By whom the Judgment hath already been In part enacted, and who thus have made The very details of their common lives A solemn chain of linkÃ¨d sacraments! O can the shame of whispering our disgrace In the sole audience of a gifted priest Be other than a sweetest right, far off Copying that chastest sorrow, the deep shame Wreaked on the Lord by vile unwashen hands, When with ineffable shrinking were laid bare His Virginal Limbs unto the soldiers' gaze? And if in such unclothing of our hearts As monsters we may seem, disgrace hath grown A cherished thing since Jesus stooped thereto. Is there no faith, no joy in self-revenge? When for the healing of themselves men court The cleansing discipline at others' hands, Or to put out the light of haughty eyes, And from the good opinion of themselves To be by instantaneous act outlawed, Prompted by half reluctant lowliness Call one beneath them, and insist to have Their face by shameful spittings vilified, Their looks dishonourably marred, there is A thrilling sweetness in the indignity That quickens love of Christ almost to tears! If each temptation baffled is an act Above our nature, each desire restrained A heavenly thing, each bending of the knee In lowly praise or self-abhorring prayer A supernatural motion, think, O think All day and night what supernatural acts Are being performed upon the face of earth! O think when darkness deepens solitude, And when the night-air vibrates with the wings Of the lost angels, multiplying sin,â When the wild weather brings a silentness Of human toils, and thought, thus respited From the salubrious action of fatigue, Feeds upon thought, and so engenders crimeâ Ponder, O ponder till thou art consoled The acts, which evil in its strife with good Is raising above mortal stature then, And canonizing with reluctant skill! So did I venture then to estimate My purpose of surrender, to endure The death I owed, but from which I had fled; And in the presence of my own resolve, Which was but partially my own, I stood Most gravely cheered, and with a lightened heart. And yet, methinks, when first I saw the beams Of the calm sunset on the hauberks glance Of those who kept their watch upon the walls Of Pevensey, whose unillumined front Faced the grey sea, my purpose somewhat shrunk, So fair appeared my native land, so sweet Even the poor residues of outlawed life, So like a dream the guilty past, as though An effort of the mind could shake it off, And leave me pure and happy as a child! The fishers on the beach, the castle guards, The traders in the town,âall life appeared Bound on a wheel of order and content So peaceably revolving, could it be The pains of one forgotten criminal Might yet enhance the welfare of the State? Roused from this passing dream, that self-same night Beheld me in the forest, with the stars Spangling the summer skies above my head, Journeying to Winton, in whose ancient shades The court then lay: and there at Henry's feet I made confession of my guilt, and sued For punishment. My fiefs already gone,â For services performed in Palestine My life was rendered me, a woful term, Yet mercifully granted, to be passed In penance, from the favour of the Church, For an uncertain term, and from her keys, And her appliances of grace, cast forth. Within the abbey of St. Cross I stood, Divested of my chains, to hear that doom With direful ceremonial then pronounced, And while the ritual darkness o'er my soul Projected miserable fears, and shades Of dreadful expectation, I went forth, Stricken, and set at large. A sudden storm Fell with thin misty sheets of whirling rain Upon the breadth of sealike mead outstretched Between the walls of Winton and St. Cross; And now and then white sunbeams pierced the cloud, And raced each other on the green chalk hills, Or for a moment blanched the minster tower, Which scarce o'ertopped the grove of ancient trees. And the sweet pastoral Itchin, whose full stream Twinkled with beaded rain-drops, slowly rose, Fretting the loose earth from its sedgy bank, And gurgling through the long grass in the fields. Beneath the gable of the abbey mill I screened myself within an elder clump, Rather by habit prompted than annoyed By the rude beating storm, so calm compared With that blind wretchedness which ruled within. So penal seemed that gift of lengthened life, The life which I had once so longed to keep! My soul, concentering all its thoughts on death, Grew calm, because its end was near, and now, That end put further off, lost all the power, Which steadfast concentration had conferred. Ah! with what mild encounter did I meet The placid offices of nature there, Cradling my heart to peace, to trust, to love! For even in those unlikely shades she lurked To minister to all who lingered near, With love as universal as the grace, Which wanders through the byeways of the world Compelling humble souls. There was I soothed Beyond all hope, and soberly beguiled, By the calm concourse of familiar sounds, Which alternated with the cheerless wind That sighed and sobbed upon the mossy roof:â The momentary beating of the wheel, The panting of the stream which, leaping down, Was dissipated in its breathless fall, The singing drops upon the black mill-pool, The winnowing of the elder boughs that caught The troubled current, or with nodding leaves Quaked in the ceaseless whirlwind of the wheel. Beneath the rustling elders there, whose eaves Of sombre and unsunny foliage hung Dipping their half-ripe berries in the grass, And whence the rain-drops glanced as from a shield, My weary spirit, slowly gathering strength Of self-possession, ventured to look forth Upon that desert world, that lonely range Of life now left her; but her wandering thoughts Sent out, like Noe's raven, came no more Either to kindle hope, or certify Fears, best endured when all the worst is known. The earth, whose gloom was tremulously lit By flashes from the dread cherubic swords, To Adam's eye less comfortless might seem Than to an excommunicated soul The blissful aspect of wide Christendom, Peopled with benedictions, rife with grace, So that its very kingdoms sing for joy! But woe unto the lost and outcast heart, For whom the verdict of the mighty Church Transmutes it all into a foreign land, A foreign tongue whose accents musical He cannot catch, a silent wilderness Coiled like a fatal ring around his feet, Which he o'erlooks but may not overstep, Unpopulous, void, vacant, terrible! Fearful it was in that dread hour to think Of man, of mortal happiness and hope, Of cheerful duties and affectionate bonds, Such as were common as the dust of earth Within that white-walled city. I was stung By such sweet thoughts, and since my penance was So righteously awarded, I was left Without the bulwark of imagined wrong To fortify my pride. Upon the grass And oozy herbs that grew in that dank shade, I flung myself in bitterness of heart, And wept with fiery tears; and there the eye Of all mankind in pitiless regard And with intelligent dislike appeared To gaze upon me; and more fearful far, The dead looked forth from out the dewy earth With eyes that beamed intolerable love, Disquieted with grief; and from her peace Methought my mother fixed on me her glance, As I had seen it oft in hours of sin, An apparition haunting me for good;â Ah! had it beamed with anger or with scorn It would have been less terrible,âbut no, It wore the old approving smile, the look Of radiant pleasure and maternal love, Which seemed to thrust me lower than before In vileness and degrading shame. I lay Bowed to the earth beneath my awful curse, As though my sin was fresh that very hour, And the intervening years, with what they brought, Cancelled, annulled as though they had not been. But never did I less desire to die Than in that hour; though like a frightened child Cowering beneath some dull nocturnal fear, I deemed that death was nigh, and with faint voice Prayed broken prayers for respite to repent, And felt my heart to see if it still beat, And prayed again. O holy monk! it seems An awful thing, a very awful thing, To lay our hands upon our hearts, and feel How slight the separation is of life From death, a feeble beating motion there, Scarce audible but in the dead of night, Or when the causeless fear of death surrounds And keeps the thoughts at bay, a quivering pulse Which ever seems upon the point to stop, Twixt each pulsation halting as in doubt. And yet no less a bulwark doth dispart Our living and our dying than the Mind Of God Most High, nor can that beating stop Without a solemn act of Will Divine. Yet when at times Eternity doth sound With audible faint knocking at our hearts, Asking its frightened welcome, that our fears May haply so rehearse the act of deathâ As the sea-water gurgles at our ears When we lie down with but a plank between Our helpless selves and a most horrible endâ 'Tis hard to smile, and say in childlike peace, That the weak plank is an Almighty Will! Between two moods thus swayed, now self-possessed And calm, now into puerile dismay And trembling fancies broken, and conceits Of panic mastering all the nerves of will, I lay for hours within that elder shade, Musing in trance-like thought upon the world Of happiness, and grief with others borne, For others suffered, therefore no such curse As that which preyed on me. Thus did I muse, When suddenly before my spirit's eye There was as if a breaking down of bars, A swift disparking of obstructed hopes, Till the whole unimpeded future lay Open, endurable; and far within I heard the thunder which a rapturous thought Makes in the mind when it reveals itself, And passes on: the peopled world was lost, Swept from my vision as the breeze at sea Breaks up the fading outline of the shore, And clears the boundless ocean to the eye. Then rose serene in glorious light profound, Fairest of images, calm Solitude, Unpeopled Silentness, where Cain himself, If humbled he had brooked the godlike Eye Of Solitude and bowed before the Voice Of solemn Silence, might have won repose, Seeking for mercy through self-chastisement, That borrows only from the Cross its power,â The simplest and divinest of all trusts, And most complete abandonment of self. Thus, when to me the thought of humankind Had grown unbearable through that access Of love, which came upon me in the hour When I was put forth from them as unclean, The nakedness of Solitude appeared A port and shelter, an oasis sunk Below the horizon of the misty sands, Where yet sweet grace, which like the desert rains, From its own plenitude o'erflows the earth In seeming waste, might fertilize the ground, And I, so reached, like some poor withered palm, Might drink the moisture and perchance revive In the lone air thus bountifully cooled, Thus mercifully tempered to my needs. Nay, father, is not that transcending life Which the Saints live, laid up with Christ in God, O is it not perpetual Solitude, Exile from base delights and soiling cares, With hopes and fears and sympathetic ties Unearthly, with a Wedlock of its own, Which through chastised virginity of soul Is like a fruitful womb unto the Lord With evangelic travail bearing sons, And with a civil Conversation which transcends The offices of human polity, And, veiled behind the water of a rite, A most miraculous Sonship, and a Food In the world's presence eaten, yet unknown, Unseen by it, but such a wondrous Food That it were well with all the Angelie Hosts If unto them that Flesh might be vouchsafed? Is not that life one endless Solitude From earthly things, a Kingdom all within, Yet with a mystic Furniture without, Where Faith is Regent, and the simplest Laws Are mysteries and supernatural words,â A Realm inscrutably concealed, though nigh To all, with Visitations from above, Outward Alliances spread far and wide Into the world of spirit, Succours coming And Messengers departing every hour, Burdened with secret liturgies, and tears Despatched to moisten Incense up in Heaven, And an Indwelling King, engrossed all day, Entire in each, yet present in all hearts, With preparation as of one who calls His army round him in a hostile land,â A very holy, peopled Solitude? Once landed then on that free shore, my chains Methought would drop from off me by the law Of nature; for the very shore it seemed Of that eternal world where all are bound, The space of desert littoral, which all Must penetrate and traverse here or there. All must be mates of Solitude for once, In the wide-spreading silence of old age, Or in the loneliness of dying thought, Or in that summing up, distinct and strong, That inward life condensed into a point Of time, a momentary act, when death Bears us like lightning o'er the trackless sands. Where all must pass why should we fear to dwell? There are who through exceeding love of God Have tenanted that region all their lives, And their chaste anthems murmur on it still; Where love hath dwelt is surely fear's best home! I will away then, said I, to that shore Where our eternal havens are: though void Of all those shelters for our nameless fears, That constant harbourage of thought in hours Of inward sinking, which the grateful sense Of nearness to our kind affords, even then When for some cause we shun their company; Though void of these, it is a sacred shore With boundless prospects that enlarge the heart, And with a freshness better far than mirth, Than beauty more magnificent, a face Of bold eternal freshness, like the sea Rolling its unchained length of silvery green, Shaking its white-maned breakers in the sun, And thundering, like a cloud in summer noons, While winter's slavery binds the household earth, And wavy tracts of snow and leafless trees, Black buried farms and cold untrodden ways, Wither our very liberty of thought, While we confess the elements our lords. I will away then, said I, to that shore And feed upon that freshness, until fear Begets compunction, and compunction love, And love her beacon trims by that seaside, Diffusing there a silent power of light Whose fanning wings move slowly through the air, Parting the raven darkness, till they touch Upon the opposing shore; and he who kneels In act of prayer may through his hollowed hands, As through a telescope, discern that bourne, Which all may reach who set their shattered helms, And point them truly by that beckoning orb, The starry signal of the Magdalen. Then I bethought me of my native hills And meres profound by winter unenslaved, True types of solitude, as I have seen The lakes and mountains on a winter's day, Pacing the beautiful and silent shores Of Windermere, unharassed by the sound Even of my feet upon the snowy beech. A glossy calm is bound upon the lake With a dull glistening, like a lucid coat Of flaky snow, while overhead the sky Sways like a tottering dome of purple grey. Above the horizon, all around, a rim Is left between the sombre clouds and earth, A hazy tract of thick and turbid white, Which like a blinded lattice doth emit, Weakly suffused, a light of troubled red, As if from flaming furnaces behind,â The sunset's ineffectual witness there. And like a visionary region float The woods, scarce lower than the stooping clouds, And all untied by aught of visible chain To the calm earth, with tree-tops, half of black Silently weeping, and half silvered o'er Where they have met the greeting of the wind; And all the twigs in beautiful arrayâ Fabrics of summer foliage are less fairâ Glisten like some ingenious work composed Of ebony and silver, to the west Bearded with rime, and in a hundred styles And mutable devices crystallized With noiseless art, while morning's feeble sun, Felt though unseen, hath blackened all the boughs Upon the east; and groups of spikÃ¨d pine Are set with pearls opaque: and O how still Appear the swelling mountains in the mist, While all the impoverished cataracts are heard Roaring like creatures tamed; and at my feet, Half on the wing, half on the water, coots, Or wild ducks, with their oarlike pinions cleave Their black cold-gushing wakes upon the mere; And from the womb of some cloud-curtained vale The bellowing of the miner's blast is heard, Making the air to tingle for awhile, Waving the ponderous skirts of lowering mist, And thrilling on the silent snowy shore. Such and so quiet seemed that land to me, As is the solitary winter lake, An unimpeded calm, and restful haven. Therefore to my hereditary hills I went, and mid their woods and treeless wolds, And purple moorlands veined with argent brooks, With solitude have long consorted now, Become inured to her strange discipline, In love with her wild nurture, and have learned Her written cypher, to the eye or ear A changeful revelation, and whose lore Voluminous, profoundly varied, still Goes on in mazy sweetness year by year Expounding and illustrating itself In deep instructive sequence. My wild voyage Amid the horrors of the Caucasus, And central lakes of Asia, and grey steppes O'er which the wind in its tired passage faints, Was the harsh pupillage wherein I learned The wisdom of the jealous-featured earth, The language of her shows, the direful powers, Which in the tempest and the calm reside And sounding elements, that terrify With their collision mortal wanderers cast Mid those fierce angels in the dreadful seats Of that mysterious continent, whereon Alone the Feet of the Most High have stood. For there the powers of nature have been wont To bow before no delegated voice, But suit their goings out and comings in To His immediate Word, while good and ill Stirring like pomps of shadow o'er the earth, Are but the troubled umbrage of the fight, The actual fight, delivered on those shores, In those primeval haunts where man first dwelt, And where the voices of elected seers Have sung the measures of his destinies, Which the Creator, clothed in Human Flesh, Hath sealed in Person on the BlessÃ¨d Rood! Asia, first-born of history wert thou! O sacred land! through Blood and Tears of God Instinct with thrills of consecrated life, Within whose mountainous bosom lies the dust Of venerable Adam, and the grave Delved by the Lord for him who led the Church From the dark Nile-banks, and the odorous earth Which was the bed of that most sorrowing Maid, The Virgin-Mother, and whose ancient tombs Have had one resurrection, by the streets Of Salem witnessed! Through the ponderous shades, Which the old empires cast upon thy breast, Still redly gleams the cloven path of fire, Whereby the unburied Prophet, caught from earth, Into the hidden Eden was conveyed, And those intolerably radiant Steps Of Him who scaled the ethereal ridges back With His new nature, His victorious spoils, To His eternal glory with His Sire! Methinks the man to whom it hath been given To set his foot upon that awful soil, To see the sun on pebbly Jordan glance, To hear the wind among the cedars sigh Of terraced Lebanon, or watch the stars From seaside Carmel, or from Olivet Bear off the hoary dust upon his shoes, Nay, walk one hour upon the furthest coast, And feel that Asia is beneath his feet,â Methinks the man, to whom it was vouchsafed, Were sphered some little higher than his kind, And, with such priesthood vested, might attract The eye of us far Westerns as he passed Along our streets,âif Jesus had not said, The deepest and most wondrous truth that e'er Fell on the ear of our astonished world, That he who did His Father's Will in faith, Though faith there never was which mated hers, Stood equal with that wondrous Maid of grace, The Mortal Woman, Mother of our God!â A written truth, yet haply raised above Lawful rehearsal by a sinner's lips, For whom it were sweet privilege enough To think with far less daring thoughts of her Who sits above all creatures now assumed. In that probation of wild travel then I learned the mystic language of the earth From her oracular lineaments, composed In the calm semblance of midnight and noon, Her scenic writing blazoned evermore In shifting scrolls, with difficulty learned And piece by piece, as one who toils and toils Some foreign tongue to master, a strange task Which all unlike our other knowledge seems Rather the work of time than intellect. The rest thou know'st: within this hilly tract Nature hath been to me the supplement Of what the Church withdrew; a partial aid Indeed it was, and I but hungered more For what I lost, and yet a real aid, By her not disavowed, as I believe. The shape of sin, which in this solitude Hath haunted me, a word will briefly tell. It was the loss of balance in my mind: Either inclining to a hope too high, Too vigorously winged, for one who fell As I had fallen, or depending low To a despondency and flagging faith, Which did dishonour by its craven doubts To the sweet love which drew our Lord from Heaven. Father! the hour draws on when I must die; My ear is all unmuffled, and I catch The footfall of that solemn messenger. Father! I kneel before thee, to the Church Who speaks in Thee, and to my only Lord Whom she doth represent! O blessÃ¨d Church! Most awful, most affectionate Mother! here I call the hills to witness, and the sea And the dark forests and the flooded brooks, The caves high up, and countless tops of pine Above whose level I have made my prayers, If I have uttered one proud word, or paid Thee aught but benediction for the curse For my salvation mercifully bound Upon thine erring child. O Mother Church! Whom as the Presence of my God I fear, Forego thy healing wrath; once ere my death O let my famished spirit feast on song, And manifold thanksgiving, and the Host Upon unbloody Altars sacrificed; That in thy visible bosom here received I may in hopeful type discern my lot Hereafter, and may find the peaceful Fires, Our first safe resting-place beyond the grave, Fore-opened by thy golden Keys on earth. Mother of Saints! receive thy sinful son: I crave thine Absolution ere I die! Thus spake the Knight; and down the Abbot's cheeks The tears flowed fast: the merciful old man Was moved, and blessing Jesus for the powers To frailest vessels of poor earth consigned, He laid his hands upon the Penitent, And with the Cross untied the icy curse. It was not age that made them tremulous, But the sweet Spirit who fulfilled his soul And shed Himself with every ritual word. The golden evening gathered gently round, Throwing the coloured shadows from the panes With Saints and Martyrs duskily annealed; When vespers chimed Sir Lancelot was shrived. Service is o'er; with swift and noiseless steps, And graceful modesty of outward mien, Which of itself might win a worldling's heart, The monks have glided from the twilight church, Save a few kneeling forms that here and there The morrow's meditation choose, or make Their scrutiny of conscience, or adore The Hidden Presence on the shrine reserved, That Sanctuary, that most Domestic Home Of gentle nuns and self-renouncing monks. There too Sir Lancelot knelt: the mountain wind And the wide ocean could not half so much Dilate his soul, as those long solemn aisles, Dim glittering Altars, incense-burdened air, The recent benediction of the Host, And mutely preaching symbols of the Faith. The sudden peace that haply may confront The unbodied soul, which but a moment since Was struggling on the death-bed, may afford No unjust image of the rapturous calm, Which fell from heaven upon that joyous man, Once more within a Christian church enclosed. And far off kneeling in the misty nave Which sunset still imperfectly illumed, His gladness found an utterance, not in prayer, But objectless recital to himself Of what was all around him, growing now Familiar as it used to be of old, But with a childish wonder pondered still Thus in spontaneous rhythm his words broke forth, No formal prayer, but happy prayer-like hymn, As if to reassure his doubting mind That what he saw was no delusive dream. THE HYMN. See, see how evening's sloping shadows grow Upon the massy nave, and all the stone Is flecked with little clouds of colour, thrown From the west window; on the ground they go, Silently creeping eastward, while the air Thickens within the choir, and so conceals The Altar, whose benignant presence there The slowly rocking lamp alone reveals. Ah me, how still! Our Lady's Vesper song Hath died away amid the choral throng; But the pure-visaged moon, that climbs elate The throne of day, now strikes with trembling light The painted lattice, where the livelong night Saint Mary chants her lone Magnificat. Hail, Mary, hail! O Maiden-Mother, hail! In thankfulness I lean upon the thought Of thy mysterious chastities; unsought Comes the sweet faith thy prayers can never fail In that high Heaven where thou hast been assumed; And with this hope my spirit newly plumed Strives upward, like a weary dove in sight Of her lost refuge, steering by the light Wherewith thy name hath silently illumed The Church below, cheering the gradual night The world hath forced upon the primal day Of our sweet faith; and I, on penance cast Till patient yearning should retrieve the past, May bless thee for the succour of thy ray! The light is vocal, wavering on the glass;â The jewel midway in the braided hair, The eyes, the lifted hand, are speaking there, And o'er the lips the argent quiverings pass. She sings! she sings! but thirsty silence drinks The heavenly sound before its burden sinks Into my listening ear. Hail, Mary, hail! Hail thou that art the haven of the heart Accessible in all our moods, a veil Obscuring not, but gifted to impart New aspects of the Cross: though sin erase That Sign from Heaven, before our downcast eyes, Which fall on thee, its sweet reflection lies Like a soft shadow in a moonlit place. Hail, Mary, hail! O Wondrous Mother! pray To thy dear Son who takes our sins away! BOOK X. THE COMMUNION. On the round summit of Black Combe I stand, While yet the rosy lips of evening seem To drink the level sea, and Mona's peaks, Their brief illumination past, retire Into the invisible distance one by one. On either side a very realm is spread Of old conventual lands and Church domain. Southward the cape of Furness by the hills And sister gulfs from England seems cut off, A kingdom for the Abbot, royalties Of blythest tillage and uncounted wealth Of ore that stains the brooks and narrow ways, As though some recent battlefield were nigh. Northward to Calder Cell and wild St. Bees, And to the dusky verge of Copeland Chase, The Church, out-balancing the knightly fiefs By unity much more than breadth of glebe, Upon that exquisite sea-border dwelt. Another face is breathed upon the land, A mighty change, which on this summit lone Invokes the past before me, and persuades My verse to wander from its end awhile The better to attain that end at last With more intelligent solemnity; And let it be permitted to the bard, Through the strong habit of monition formed By pastoral office pleading with the poor And the hardhearted rich, to buy the right Of pleading from this sombre mountain-top With the cold reason of the worldly wise, And let the earnest will atonement make For this poetic fault, while I forget The trespass of suspended action now Through hope to achieve a practical design:â Lofty the old tribunal where I stand A self-called preacher, haply then too high A strain for me, yet let me be forgiven If I offend through pure though ill-taught love! While yet I muse, in pale etherial folds The twilight deepens at my feet, and earth And ocean scarce distinguishable were, But that a wavy belt of sand emits A dull uncertain glimmer, to the eye Less obvious every moment; while above The stars encumber with their multitude The heavenly dome, each sparkling, as it seems, Through a pure liquid teardrop on its orb. O desolate, most desolate! The man Who in the Thirteenth Age might haply climb This mountain watch-tower could behold a scene Which spoke of Christian verities, and love And homage paid to them by humankind, A scene which like a monument set forth The truth, and in an obvious type displayed Even to gross eyes the splendour of the Faith. But nowâO weep for that transfigured Nowâ Let the full heart in thoughtful silence weep! Yet, great the consolation to be found In what the Past bequeaths of heavenly ways And of the style, if such presumptuous words Be lawful here, of Providential Acts And Dealings with the fallen race of man. For such the picture of the Churchâthe eye Trembles in gazingâthrough all time displayed; The earth hath been the death-bed of the Church For ever and for ever; not an age Hath come and gone when it was not believed By those, who through the Present's darkling glass Beheld but fragments of her fortunes then, She was outworn and at the point to fail, Unequal to her calling, to her strife, Her many-sided combat with the world, And as infallibly, in that her hour Of weakness, found unto another youth Even then most near when seeming most to fail. But hast thou from a mountain-girdled plain, Or through the vista of a lake-lit dell, Watched the magnificent gathering of a storm, The silent muster of the fiery clouds With such determinate slowness wheeling up, The swiftness of loose vapours and torn mists With a wan sunshine on them, and the rents Opening and closing like huge furnace-doors, Contrasting so with that immoveable And pausing centre, till the unwieldly host, The mighty fabric all complete, begins Its solid march across the hushed blue sky? With what a steadfast course it sweeps along, And overbears the ineffectual winds, Which scarce can ruffle its advancing edge! Then in that preparation, in that pause, In that on-rolling, in that vocal fire, In the portentous swervings here and there, In the disparting, reuniting cloud, In the deep ever-growing shade it casts, And in that strong attraction which the storm Exerts upon thyselfâthou hast well read, In all their various uniformity, The solemn chronicles of Holy Church! And doth the storm in its mutations grow To be less cognizably one? the calms Which follow its wild speaking, are they less Terrific than its voice? and is there not An order, nay, a most undoubted grace, In its confusions? Such an awful stormâ How often self-transfigured, disarrayed, Growing, aggressive, gathered, and dispersed, Yet palpably divine!âis Holy Church, So utterly the same that she can be Exceeding mutable; and this last power May breathe some life into our flagging hopes, Baffling the craven love of ancient times, And gloriously repelling, as a shield, Foul accusations of decay. For she With sweet spontaneous effort can give forth New forms of ancient doctrine, fit to mate New changes and new wants in Christendom,â Whether in primitive germs long since implied, And by ascetic men elicited; Or, on evasive error to lay hold, Through subtle process distantly inferred; Nay, sometimes with majestic increment, Awful enlivening of her hidden strength To exhilarate her children's drooping hearts, Varying her ancient catholic harmonies, Fresh salient truths our Mother superadds, And with accumulated youth moves on,â A Living Storm, O how much to be feared And how much to be loved! no Written Thing, No Literary Puzzle of the past, No difficult, discoverable Lore, The churlish scholar's sole exclusive prize,â But never lost, and therefore needing not To be recovered,âopen, tangible, Belonging to the multitudinous Poor, Christ's Presence with the Simple Ones of earth! Such is the steadfast look, and scenery Sublime as an eternal mountain chain, In storm involved or transient sunshine keen, Of that primeval beauty of the Church, Beheld far off by us who can embrace Enough of God's broad counsels to discern The general aspect of the Christian Past. Yet to the warriors mingling in the strife With rolling garments, fire, and dust, and blood, All seemed confusion o'er the battling earth, And nothing clear but Heaven's blue tract above; And unto them the End was ever nigh, Not seeminglyâbut with mysterious truth Brought near, as we are touching on it now. Hereon we build our faith and hope to-day; Not without tokens of an outward sort In silent gratitude received, as signs Of Love which every morning sees renewed And of Compassion lasting as the hills. There is a time which goes not to the account Of past or present, and which cannot be Part of the days unborn,âthe future's verge, A stirring antepast of change to come, That little space when men can ascertain, Even in the crowded turmoil of their age, A pushing root which has not flowered as yet, Nor had green leaves, but, succoured by their acts, Protrudes into the surface of their times. Then earnestness keeps vigil, wrapped in such Quiescent expectation as mine eye, Not wholly fancy-free, hath deemed it saw Upon the bright church steeples on the night When the last workday of the weary week Comes with sweet sunlit evenings, so to pay Preluding homage to the lonely feast Grudged, if accorded, to the English poor. The silent faces of those buildings seem To speak from out the radiant foliage drawn Around the grassy chamber of the dead, Even as the future will appear to throw Discordant meaning and expression strange Into the countenance of the present days. Such is the true account of every time;â No time to us is future, present, past, But such commingling of the three as gives To men a light and guarantee to act, With cheering motive summoned from the past, And urgent call by present needs expressed, And that forecasting purpose which alone Can stamp a value on a Human Act, And wed it to God's Will,âand such an aim The future is commissioned to supply. There is no actual Present in the world, No such free time, to a believing man. Summon the Past; and let it be that Age Through which the wayward channel of my song Wanders, and ask an oracle of it. Learn from its lips how history may become A travelling voice of prophecy, that rings With cumulative echoes, and expounds The solemn shadows of the Past to be Forestallings of the Judgment, images, Successively presented, of the growth, The strife, the victory, and the doom of sin. Learn from its lips how then the Church was laid Beneath the shadow of the Empire dying, And how before the awe-struck West she lit, Like a fresh Angel, on the Hills of Rome! Long, yet most grateful, hath the study been, And with no vague design by me pursued, To trace the under-currents of that age, The secret bearings, which might haply give A bias to its temper, and might serve To mould the forms of intellectual life In such peculiar greatness. Hard it is, Even for imagination, to beget The thought of what the life of Christians was In those past ages, and most hard to shift The inward habit of our modern thoughts In such adjustment as to arbitrate Fairly between the Present and the Past, Neither too much extolling, nor too much Condemning, through impatience of research: For Christ is alway present with His Spouse, Both when she sits on throues, and when she weeps In ashes vile; and where that Presence is, Dwells truest Greatness, never so much veiled But that meek faith may see where she must kneel. Not in the pride of study let us come, Nor in idolatrous regard of Past Or Present, nor with an ignoble lust Of fame, by curious lore to be enhanced; But rather with a meditative love Of these our times, where our sole duties lie, With meek misgivings anxious to discern On every cape a lighthouse, by the Past Beneficently raised to guide and warn: Or in more hopeful posture still, with prayer And study locked in mutual embrace, Disciples, round the opening of a tomb, Where the dear relics of a Saint repose Which we to our own Altars would translate, Upon our knees expectant, so to catch The perfume of devout Antiquity. There is a German faith, which may be seen Grimly depicted on the cottage walls Of that too hopeful people: in a cave Within an ancient forest's silent gloom, Amid a grassless labyrinth of tall pines Which scarce the song-birds tenant, sleeps a man With his dropped sword unbroken at his feet, His huge bowed head, and hands with gauntlets off, And his long ruddy beard in coils around: A very fearful warrior, by the serfs Discovered once, but in his cavern left, Most awful even in his helpless sleep, Whose dreams are of a world long past away And with slow circuit coming back again! Who hath not heard of that most mighty king Hight Barbarossa, who once scourged the West, And how he lost his politic renown Amid those isolated points of life, The crowd of old Transalpine commonwealths, And how he battled with our lord the Pope, And bruised, as others have before and since, His crownÃ¨d brow against Saint Peter's Chair? Deem him not wholly evil: he was one Of those perverted grandeurs of the past Marred and misshaped by Satan, to stand forth As laughing-stocks for ages; but the world, Envying the blissful Church who loseth not The living intercession of her Saints, And can approach their far-off rest by prayers, Fables that her past glories too survive, Simply withdrawn, until their time returns. So covetous are men of what is great, So rightly covetous, that faiths, grotesque As this, have hearts that put their trust therein. And verily such wholesome legends stand In front of deep and most inspiring truths, Bearing the quaint device, whereby the minds Of untaught men may plainly comprehend The whole philosophy of that wise awe And loving reverence due unto the past. So Barbarossa slumbers in his cave Where wailing pines make endless lullaby; So Arthur sleeps in Avalon to-day, Whose grassy cone all Somerset beholds; O verily those sleepers will return! How fearful is the onward flight of Time, A luminous avenue which guides our eyes And leaves them fixed upon the Judgment-seat! And to the scholar, in his lowly search Amid the shipwrecked pageants of the Past, It is a grave and yet affectionate thought, Which many an ancient liturgy supplies, That Ages are not cold and abstract names, But spiritual Powers instinct with life And gifts, and Witnesses intelligent Of human conduct, Angels deemed of old: As if each Age, though squaring not perchance With our material measures, subject were To its own Guardian Angel thus allowed His season to administer the Church, Thereon to impress the signet of his will, And fashion it in his peculiar grace, Bending its virtues while he thus constrains Recoiling ills to take a special course,â If to those blessÃ¨d Hosts there be a will Beyond the Mind of God. And, so it is, Each Age with after-baptism is surnamed By the kind Church from its chief mode of good, While by the worldly from the gross recoil Of evil on the surface is it called. And deeper than a pleasant thought may be The strong imagination, that we hold Sublime and yet endearing intercourse With some one of the radiant Host of Heaven, Cherubic Mind or deep Seraphic Heart, Or steadfastness of some paternal Throne, Whene'er we ponder in confiding love The function of an Age, some special Age Singled with thoughtful choice. O then how sweet, And yet how infinitely solemn, seems The chamber of the student, oft in prayer With his mute books around him, while he calls, With such meek invocation as he may, The Angels of the Ages to supply The keys of those old written chronicles; And purchases his knowledge with a vow, Morning and eve renewed, abjuring fame, That he will dedicate to Holy Church The scanty produce of his patient toils. So let us study with those Angels round, The Spirits of the Ages, while we trace In frequent signature the blessÃ¨d Cross Upon our bosoms, making all our lore Unworldly, as we gain it, and our thoughts Dissevering from the taint of self-conceit. O when we lift the veil from off those days, With what a sacred beauty is the heart O'erwhelmed, and by how strange a scene surprised! We live on earth, and Heaven is far away, Another world, and by itself insphered In jealous separation from the spot Whereon our blindfold spirits feel and act. This is the instinct of our present age. But, then, with bold magnificence of thought, Which nothing but a pure simplicity Of faith and holy living could inspire, Heaven was invoked to fill the vacant earth, So that the teeming solitudes ran over With its bright presence, and material forms Were clothed with spirit, yea, full oft absorbed In heavenly splendour, to forgetfulness Translated of their own original use. For through its several kingdoms earth to them With Heaven was all inlaid: its awful touch On private life, and on the social state And the grave forms of law, had power to shed A gracious beauty and imposing mien, With no reluctant homage then confessed, When with such sanctions sealed as overbore By their dread import idle questioning. In the prerogative of kings men saw Somewhat of God's Authority transfused, A show of regency which barely veiled The gesture of His Attributes behind. And in the ceremonials of the law Vengeance with healing discipline was joined, Which men of darkened conscience at this day Would fain put from them as a power that bears Uneasy witness to the unseen world; And mercy with mysterious vagueness flowed From the pure impulse of the sovereign will, Not seldom by divine suggestion ruled. And utterly unknown was that vile thought And base division, which would now degrade The secular power, and with unblest divorce Confine it in a barren sphere, apart From spiritual regards and rights divine Of Holy Church, the radiant element Whose exile, happily yet unconfirmed By the discordant nations, would have left The sphere of politics a formless world Without a sun, and daily working back Into that moral chaos whence it sprung, When Rome's great Spirit o'er the gloom went out, And stirred the darkness of that uncouth Past, And with creative harmony called up, Like some enchantress verily inspired, From out the strife of battling principles, That birth of beauty, Western Christendom. Nor were the thoughts of men in those great days Less sensibly uplifted, or their hearts With an inspiring wisdom less sustained. To them the world was sweetly populous With old ancestral truths and touching faiths And beautiful surmises, imaging Upon the face of nature heavenly forms With something more than bare similitudes. The qualities of precious stones, the ways Of the wild tenants of the sylvan chase, The hidden will which in the growing plant Fashioned the leaves and coloured the gay flower,â All were to them as ritual books that taught A Christian science, and laid bare the veins Of spiritual Presence that enriched Their world, and would so aptly reinforce The languid pulse of our impoverished lives: A science not yet utterly withdrawn From us, but in the realm of herbs and flowers Among our native peasants living still In moving legends, expositions wild, And meek acknowledgment of powers unseen, Which at the roots of our salubrious plants Give battle to the spirits of misrule With varying success. And yet methinks, With some vibrations in the popular heart Still ascertainable, traditions live Descended from antiquity, and are The poetry of shepherds and poor men, Not without influence on their Christian lives, Sometimes by local usage canonized, More oft by lips of hoary ancients taught, And handed on in shrines of prose or verse. Beautiful Past! And yet thou art to me But a true gage wherewith to take the height And measure of the Present: or, at most, The testament of an affectionate sire, Which, when the wealth bequeathed is through neglect Dispersed, or irretrievable mischance, Hath still a value to the pious heart For each expression of his wish, and trains Of monitory thought that flow therefrom. For surely there is more than weak self-love, A nobler and more feeling wisdom, couched In that habitual attitude of mind, Which would regard the Present as brought near In such relation to ourselves, our acts And aspirations, that it should present A scene of more sublime magnificence, More stirring interests, more expressive grace, Than the most gorgeous section of the Past. Here lie our duties, loves and hopes and fears; Here have we tenderest intercourse with those Our fellow-workers, with the lately dead Most intimate affections; here we pray, And tremble at the plain responses sent Unto our prayers; here we retard or aid The solemn progress of the mighty change, Which in the bosom of its swift advance Bears us along, unconscious yet how far Or on what road we travel, but most wise When least reluctant, tranquil in our faith, Our masculine belief as Christian men, Yea, more than tranquil, with abounding joy, So long as Conscience ascertain each step, Chanting a sponsal anthem as we go, As blind but happy minstrels on the prow Of gallant change upon discovery bound. Time hath no havens: in the stress of storm The world perforce remains upon the sea. O desolate, O weary wandering world! For where can she put in, or where refit Her shattered rigging, or where hope to cast An anchor, save before the Judgment-seat, Whose rocky base flings back the languid tide And the spent waves of time, lest they should quicken The deep calm pulses of eternity? O were it well to breathe so bold a prayer, Or seek an office which so far transcends My faculties, it were that I might sing Through a long course of meditative years In rapturous flights and loud impassioned verse The grandeur of the Present Times, the change Which, like a vast on-coming cloud, bids fair To eclipse the mighty forms of ancient days With forms more mighty still; and not as now, With querulous sweetness to frequent the woods, And mate the running streams with lisping song! The earth is all awake; from her long sleep, Her stagnant slumber when the glory passed Even from her dreams, she started and awoke, And battled blindly with her hands as one Whose brain the mists of slumber still oppress. But now with troubled dignity she fronts The dawn of her new duties like a queen. On every side the aspect of the world Shifts visibly: gigantic figures rise, Like clouds at sea, upon the horizon line Of the close future, and together draw In heavy preparation, yearly clothed With more distinct array, and looking out, A bland and noble destiny, on earth, Who with a tremour of impatience waits Such blissful usurpation of her realms. For keen expectancy doth now project Into the souls of men an earnestness And a courageous hope, for long unknown; And daring dreamers scattered here and there, Like prophets, fling the ancient idols down, And tune the solemn voice of humankind To a new music, borrowing it may be Some sweetness from the Past, but most enriched With wild and novel keys, whereon the hands Of Time and Chance have never pressed before. And who so blind that he misreads the signs Which thicken round him, or mistakes the sound Of barriers falling in the East and West, And national distinctions waxing faint, Worn by the pressure of more ample thoughts, More ample sympathies, and by the powers Newly conferred for his new wants on man,â Congenial energies which hope may hail As opportune allies,âwhile all earth's sons Seem now about to be together thrown And blended in one single brotherhood? Who would not too with exultation point At that large-hearted wisdom which eludes The measure of all party names, and rends With a high-souled disdain the vulgar shapes Of faction, and with wise constructive love, Goodness accounting man's sole greatness, truth The world's sole beauty, learns to sympathize, And with discerning jealousy to walk, With these in whatsoever places found, With whatsoever hateful powers allied, Saving the honour of the blessÃ¨d Faith? For thus, if sin mar not the goodly work, The unconscious world through these capacious hearts Is edging forward into unity. And, for that invocation of high Heaven To come into the bosom of our age, A psalm for such long centuries unsung,â Is it not even now begun on earth? Is it not heard far off and near at once, Rising from separate hearts, like fragrant curls Of odour from a hundred censers swung With even modulation? Doth not earth Already glow with somewhat of a light Above her own, beatified in part As Heaven pervades her kingdoms more and more? What if the Right Divine hath been withdrawn From kings and from the mystery of birth, Revoked for long misuse, and we in them Now recognize a power on civil law Dependent, for the sake of God, and not As God, by us acknowledged and obeyedâ Hath not the heavenly Right been lodged anew Deep in the bosom of the Christian State, Buried within the Popular Will, and thus Magnificently perilled, that the world A third time with fresh auspices may strive That holy Right and Presence to retain? O solemn venture! who would not be cheered By danger thus sublime? Who would not pray, Ah with what diffidence of sinful man! That holy lamp, once stifled in the air Of ancient Monarchies, may be relumed Within the shrine of Christian common-wealths; And thence dispelling that unhappy cloud Of misbelief, which hath three ages clogged The better destinies of humankind, A new and glorious vision may be seen, A Christendom, more vast than that of old, In catholic faith and ritual sweetly joined, Embracing with its beautiful restraints The Spirit of Democracy, made wise Through many sufferings, solemn and serene As earth would fain desire, about to meet The dawn and day-break of Eternity! Ah me! and have I ventured to aspire Upon the prow of this majestic change To sit, and watch the vessel of the world Dipping uneasily into the deep, And tune my trustful anthems as it heaves, Embodying these my burning hopes in song? Peace! peace! ambitious heart! for all unmeet For thy poor strivings were such glorious task: And peace, ye clamorous hopes! which, like a brood Of callow hawks impatient to essay The limpid ether round yon hanging cliff, Project themselves too far beyond the bound Of heaven-taught sadness. But if we would gaze In studious prayer, as on a crystal lake Whose clearness makes its depths more palpable, All day upon the Fourfold Countenance Of the deep Gospels, we should learn perforce This sobering lesson, that the men most nigh Unto the Person of the Son of God Withheld their yearning lips from hopeful strain Of trust in human conduct: zealous James Be witness, and the trumpet tongue of Jude, Or ready Levi's loud judicial tone, Or that vindictive jealousy of him Who leaned upon the Saviour's very Heart. Let these confront the kind permitted truths, Broad hope, and credulous belief of good, In ardent Paul, or Luke whose anxious pen, Blandest physician of repenting souls, In his affectionate Gospel would amass All hopeful traits of those who might approach Our Lord, all merciful regards by Him To their weak trust in times of need vouchsafed. England! dear England! Island of the Saints! Thy broad blythe champaign, and sheep-spotted wolds, Thy ferny forest-lands, and hawthorn glades, Thy park-like fields, and water-meadows green, And rushy brooks, lie deep within my heart. Ah! how I compass with affectionate thought A thousand sweet localities, whereon The light of our religious past is blent With the dark presence of our modern sin! My boyhood was a year-long pilgrimage Amassing pleasant sights, which now are turned To deeper things than wells of poetry. And at this tearful hour I summon up, With individual features all distinct, Thy lifeless abbeys, and monastic homes, Quickened with but the semblance of a life, Thy broken crosses, convent-peopled fens, Disfigured minsters, fountains, woods and hills With saintly surnames; and I now behold In accurate vision, thoughtfully composed, Thy lovely Frame, thy seven and thirty Shires, Three goodly Palatines, and Islands five, With Ely's Royal Franchise for a sixth, And Town that keeps the sea-gates of the Tweed: And a bright shade upon the vision falls, Stooping thereon with palpable embrace. As, when the staff by delegated hands (How justly figuring England's futile past!) Laid on his face no sign of life evoked, Forthwith the Hebrew prophet stretched himself Upon the Sunamite's sun-stricken child, Hand touching hand, eye firmly pressing eye, And living lips upon the dead lips closed.â Even so methinks her Guardian Angel lies Incumbent on my native country's breadth, Limb upon limb at once, and working there No partial restoration; and the warmth So secretly is thrilling through her flesh, So equally pervading all her veins With tremulous augmentation ascertained, The earth is barely conscious of a change, Though with some half-incredulous fear annoyed. But there lie England and her Angel, shut From the world's notice, as the prophet was, Left, with closed doors, upon the lifeless child. The living Church beyond the seas may pray, The Saxon Saints will intercede above, And we, in happy expectation, wait, Not idle in our measure and degree, To cry, God speed the silent miracle! It is St. Peter's Day, the sacred Feast Which, not from holy Paul's great name disjoined, Bequeaths a blessing on departing June. Sweetly the spirit of the morning fills The abbey yard and hollow meads around. Those golden beams! how silently they range Upon the foliage of the hanging woods! And nature's joy, which is the love of God, Winds up the brook between the alder-trunks, Brightening the waters with a breeze-like motion, Wanders among the meadow flowers, revealed By silent wakes that crisp the nodding herbs Parted and fanned aside as if by wings, And, o'er the elastic mosses hovering up, Stealing the savoury damp that saturates The tesselated herbage of the woods, Freights the warm dew as it returns to heaven With breaths of incense and the songs of birds. And in the heart of that sweet sunken dell The Abbey, like a sentient creature, lies Couched on the dewy sward; and from the towers, Gateways and buttresses of ruddy stone, It breathes a voice into the listening woods. The upper air is all alive with bells, While on the undulating waves of sound Float the dark clamorous fleets of happy daws; And, down below, the very stones respire Celestial music from their viewless pores, While the loud choirs with pealing organs vie, Chanting the BlessÃ¨d Mass; all down the nave The thrilling torrent of the music rolls, Like an imprisoned tide, now seems to heave The mighty roof, and now with refluent stream Pours its sweet trouble eastward, and escapes, But for awhile, beneath the transept arch, Till the dumb stones and lucid windows yield An outlet to that throbbing sea of sound. It is the Preface; ah how meet and right With Angels and Archangels, and the band Of Apostolic Vicars gathered now Unto their rest and glory, to adore The Holy One with ceaseless solemn songs! That Mixolydian strain! how sweetly sad, Tutoring dejected hearts in cheerfulness, Expressive of man's twofold state below As lost in Adam and redeemed in Christ! Ah! thus is all the music of the world Confined within the Cross, whose vocal swells, Inaudible except to reverent ears, With glorious surges of heart-music fill The fertile breast of Christ's most Holy Church;â Yet not without a faint alluring sound Breathed on the outer world, to win the souls That not in power but weakness linger near, While in triumphant elegies the Bride Sings, sweetly sings, her Lord's unmated Griefs! Who is yon Kneeler that like one entranced Bends o'er the marble step, with both hands crossed Upon his bosom, raining holy tears From un-uplifted eyes? O is it grief, Or the enlarged abundance of his heart, Thus weeping from him like a summer shower? And is it prayer which parts his quivering lips, Or viewless rapture, winged with more than words, Escaping from the worn Ascetic's frame, Like trembling odours by the solar beam Wrung with extatic pain from silent flowers? It is Sir Lancelot, the Hermit-Knight, The son received into his Mother's arms, The Crown of Penance, Triumph of the Cross And Victory of Christ's Almighty Love! Press the loud organs, roll the living psalm In jubilant thunders o'er the prostrate crowd; Once moreâa loftier strain!âswell, swell the hymns,â Ye choirs, let loose the burning bolts of song; See how they flash and lighten from the roof! Hark! how divinely doth the storm of sound Gather in folded harmonies, far off And near;âfill the loud anthems higher still, Fill the deep womb of music to the brim, Until the soul of every kneeler there, Won from the body, mount upon the stream, The cloudy stream of music, and ascend Far above sin and earth, within the sight And audience of seraphic liturgies! Down, like descending Angels, see the clouds Of music, how they fold their quivering wings Above the Altar, mute and self-absorbed! Silence! the potent Canon hath begun. See how it glasses in symbolic acts And holy gestures, that exalted scene, Which fell in Patmos on the mind of him, The Virgin Seer! Behold how it reflects, Nay, by a dread Illapse brings down to earth, The heavenly Worship of the Immaculate Lamb, The Liturgy which never ends above, Answered by earth's ineffable response From out the Wonder of the BlessÃ¨d Mass! What thoughts, or rather, in the silent room Of thought deposed, what blissful Presence filled Sir Lancelot, when the Altar's Burning Coal, As with the rapt Isaias, touched his lips, Not song of minstrel, but the hearts of Saints With voiceless thrill must utter to themselves. On Hawcoat Brow in days of old there stood A deep alcove, a semicirque of stone, With canopy of sculptured palm-leaves roofed, From which the mountains of three famous realms, Laved by the western seas, far off appeared. Thither the gentle monks of Furness came, Lonely or paired, what time the setting sun Flamed o'er the golden sea and purple hills. Duly each summer evening there they went To feed the love of nature, whose prime seat Is aptly fixed upon those modest thrones,â The hearts of men of meditative ways And frequent prayer. And to their chastened thoughts Haply that landscape witnessed not so much To God's creative love, as woke the thought Of all that dread magnificent scene of wealth By Satan shown from Quaratana's top, Tempting the rightful Heir, and claiming thenâ Ah how the lordly minsters and sweet rites Of Holy Church have falsified the claim!â The beauty of the world to be his own, Of old conceded to him, and abjured By angry Heaven. Such stations, for repose And contemplation mixed, may yet be seen By him who from Arezzo climbs the hill, Whose other side, like some Cyclopean wall, Rises a hoary rampart from the vale Of Maldoli, so pleasantly outstretched With sward and trees beneath the pilgrim's eye: Or who essaysâO not without a thought Deeper and chaster than the curious mood Of restless voyager!âto scale the steep, The pine-clad mountain of the Hermitage, Whose threshold by the monitory name Of Antony from mundane thoughts is barred. There mid the rocks and whispering forests dwell Saint Romuald's sons, begotten in the faith, The noble of Ravenna whose high heart Burned, like a seraph's, with extatic love, Whose transports glistened through unceasing tears. Ah! he who by the seven clear water-springs Shall sit, and overlook the solemn waste And labyrinth of wild Apennines all round, And white-stoled figures gliding through the pines, Noiseless as sunbeams, and shall haply hear The famous clock which lifts its mighty voice In admonition of the coming End, Throughout the savage desert audible,â He, though his faith were cold as Alpine stone, Shall feel how deep the simple love of earth Was fixed in those ascetic brotherhoods, Who seemed with such a single aim to love God, that they left no room for love of man: And in his heart shall carry to his home This common wisdom, haply new to him,â He, who would love the world to tears, must first Renounce for God the love the world returns. Yet those monastic wilds may not compare With the broad prospect seen from Hawcoat Brow. But rather apt resemblance may we find, By some inferior deemed, in that Monk's Seat Perched on the old Lactarian hills that rise By Arola above Sorrento's steep, A younger-born Camaldoli; for there The enchanted eye may wander from the cliffs Of Capri northward to Miseno's horn, While far above its giant beeches towers The snowy summit of the Angel's Mount, And old Vesuvio, querulously calm, Sighs forth his azure smoke incessantly; Till the tired sight, enraptured, seeks repose Upon the nodding clouds of umbrage sunk Beneath it, on the silent chestnut groves Of Arola, or sees, (and while it sees Sleeps, cradled on the beautiful expanse,) The murmuring crescent of Parthenope! From Hawcoat hill an unfrequented road Leads to the beach, and by the tower there stands, Upon a weedy plot of wayside turf, A little hut, wherein the kindly monks, When Mass was said, installed the grateful Knight, In blissful peace, absolved and reconciled. Not vain to him was that most wondrous view,â Sea-girdled Mona, the advancing hills Beyond the misty Solway caught and lost In the blue haze, the scattered peaks of Wales On the south shore like castles in the sea, The convex of the Furness mountains, pierced By the bright snaky Duddon, and Black Combe Unveiling there his shadow-dappled face With mute expression, to Sir Lancelot known; While, like a soft suffusion of fair light, Calmly pervading many an inlet round, The summer sea with luminous heaving spread. And now to him adopted once again Into the depths of Christian privilege, His soul was free to wander unrebuked Through the broad pastures of the ancient Truth And Faith of catholic ages. To his mind Two special fields of thought were now disclosed, Not new, but in surpassing freshness clad, Transcending far the light of novelty: Even as the vales behind the mask of spring, The glory of its verdure, hide themselves, And while, entangled in the dream, our eyes The open views of leafless winter seek, From bush and brake familiar features peer, Scarce recognized for well-known household forms. Two Powers lay open to his reverent love, Waiting the homage of a soul at peace, In full communion with the Holy Church; For such and such alone, (unless it be The thoughts of children travel in those lands, And sinning souls are vexed by glimpses sent Reversed in broken dreams) shall find unbarred The royal roads of secret intercourse, Which cross the confines of the Invisible World. Free was he now in meditative awe To commune with the Angels and the Dead. There have been holy men whose spirit's eye, By outward rite to inward love sublimed, Hath been so couched, that at the BlessÃ¨d Mass Angelic bands in manifest array Have in the celebration borne their part, Aiding the mortal priest: such extasy, So legends tell, was anciently vouchsafed To him of Tolentino, seraphlike, Who from ascetic infancy grew up, A lovely marvel mid his childish peers, Unto the giant stature of a Saint. So by angelic hands upon the side Of Juliana, who in Florence wore The Servite Mantle first, a visible seal, The Sacred Host was once impressed, withdrawn From out the hand of the astonished priest Who held it to her bosom; for so wrought The extatic hunger of the heavenly Food, What time her feebleness could ill sustain Common reception: and ascetic love, Outgrowing, not supplanting, ritual acts, Might consummate an inward Eucharist. O Mother Church! who taught thine eye to see The jealous veil of separation worn Almost to nothing twixt the world of sight And brighter world of faith, by those deep thrills Of joy expecting her mysterious Food? Who taught thy voice at that sweet point of time, When feasting souls, all eagle-like, ascend, And in no self-sustaining rapture burst On high into the quivering beams of songâ Who taught thy voice in that transcendent hour Boldly to claim the Angels for thy peers, And call Archangels fellow-worshippers, While the expectation of thy kneeling sons Outstrips the ritual, soars above the earth, And, hidden among the Angels, finds its home? Sweet and tear-moving thoughts now calmly rose Within Sir Lancelot's mind; he seemed to dwell Rather with Angels than his fellow men. Their everlasting order and deep peace Such grateful contemplation did afford, As to the feeble but far-kenning sight Of saintly men who bow themselves to die, By thankless labours and rude days outworn. O beautiful Restraints in early years From secret sins and negligence in prayer, That make the darkness reverend, and disclose The sparkling eye of solitude by day, How blessÃ¨d are your offices to man! Your presence is an endless ritual, Whereby the soul makes real to herself The Omnipresence of the Holy Three, A truth so high, so infinitely raised Above the baser moods of our terrestrial life, We need the Patriarch's Ladder thus to scale That height of doctrine most ineffable. And hourly doth the soft constraining sense Of your companionship and grave regards Enhance our private acts, and solemnize What else in our retirÃ¨d modesties Might fail in dignity, until it grows A ceremonial, by the humbled pride And sober fancy not disdained as help To loftier contemplation, breeding still,â When we lie down to sleep and when we rise And for our public life prepare ourselves With all such comely types of inward things As God hath made to wait on those vile acts,â Meekness of corporal attitude and grace Of outward lowliness, which shall not fail In time to win a beautiful response From out the shrines of our interior life. Such meditation on the thrice three rings Of blest adoring spirits, which surround The EnthronÃ¨d Presence in the courts above, In ceaseless Energy, or Servitude Of an unutterably loving fear, Contemplating the Attributes Divine,â Precluded not a special homage paid To his own Guardian Angel. Woe is me That any blissful Sprite should be detained From his more intimate happiness in Heaven, To be the staff of my irregular steps, My wayward treading and poor floundering feet, Along the miry paths of human sin. O I could pity thee, Angelic Guide! For thy base office, when I loathe myself For hourly sins and pusillanimous ways, Though at such seasons dearest far to thee! So now the Knight his Guardian Angel sought With that subordinate worship, which the Church To all her children studiously suggests, An aid, if not a need, to sinning souls. His deep affections did he oft project Into the invisible world, a local world Not cast far off, but with its confines stretched Hard by, yea truly touching on himself. Oft did he lean upon his unseen Friend With realized embrace of kindly thoughts And answered invocation, craving still To lose that friendship in the holier love Of God and dearer neighbourhood of Christ, And therefore supplicating for the hour, When in the calm and orderly delight Of resurrection we shall bid farewell, Farewell unto his office, not his love, To that sweet Guardian, whose commissioned help Penance and Grace have prospered, and that day (O be it so) have brought us satisfied Unto the wakening likeness of our Lord, The restful haven where we fain would be! But greater stillâif in such sacred things Comparison befit our words or thoughtsâ Was the sweet ravishment of tranquil joy, Felt by the Knight in intercourse renewed With those at rest, the holy suffering Souls Twixt earth and heaven, to earthly hearts a bond More sensibly imposed upon our hopes And pure affections, than the wandering love Which meets the Angels on its heavenward road. The peaceful intercession of the Dead, The privilege of prayer for them, in faith That knows not what or where their spirits are, Yet lest they miss of aught they might obtain, Progress or increment or deepened peace, In that their present state still dares to pray, And loves her daring;âsuch his blameless joys, Part of the deep Communion of the Saints, Part, not the Crown; a higher Union still Remains which my weak song may not essay, Nor vileness contemplate except far off. These were the blameless joys Sir Lancelot felt, Blameless by man, but O far more than that, Far more than unblamed sacrifice to Him, In whose pure Eye the Universal Church, The myriad Saints already throned in heaven, The pilgrim Dead still somewhere on their road Bedewed with peaceful fires, the scattered few Who live and fight, one only Body are! But further heights there were for him to climb, Which common Christians in their low estate Gaze on from far; and speak with puzzled words, A cloudy nomenclature, of the stairs Which lead unto the temple of the Saints, By science not unmeasured, and to us A profitable knowledge, if it put More emulous life into our trivial acts. Those mystical Ascents Sir Lancelot now Essayed to climb upon his bended knees, As pilgrims climb the tear-dropped Stairs at Rome. And first from Meditation was he led To Recollection, where his mental powers Acted less fretfully, the vestibule Of mystic Contemplation, in whose depths The passive souls of Saints abide and breathe. More wonderful that Spiritual Calm Which follows Recollection, when the heart, With holy Presences dilated, hangs In tranquil balance fixed upon one thought, One special and engrossing Act of Christ, Or with collected vagueness all diffused, And lost within a breathless extasy Of rapturous homage to the Triune God, And wherein even the body takes its part, By mortifying practices sublimed, Not seldom lifted gently from the ground With slow ascension, and with upraised arms And garments floating on the radiant air;â Unearthly favours, yet accompanied With perfect recognition of the Will To make all fitting Acts of Faith and Love, Of Self-oblation and heroic Vows. A further truth Sir Lancelot had to learn; That God is jealous of His Own good gifts, When they are loved in place of God Himself. And as erewhile within the gloomy Ark He shut great Noe when the floods were out, So in a prison, painful, dim, and straight, Doth He confine the Saints to be prepared, By keen ablution of the inward man, For contemplation of His BlessÃ¨d Self. Dryness of Sense there comes to tempt the soul No more to persevere in bootless prayer; Dryness of Spirit next, when loving Fast And cheering Vigil, nay, the Mass itself Doth but augment the sadness of the heart, And prompts it kneeling at the Altar-step, To hate the God who gives His Flesh to us:â A Penal Light, so theologians call This piercing grief, as giving to the Saints Knowledge of previous darkness to enhance The beauty of the sunrise yet to come. Such was the Penal Light the Florentine, Of Pazzi's noble stock, five years endured; But days were years unto Sir Lancelot's soul Now that his pilgrimage drew near its close. For soon to him the half-enlightened dawn Of Contemplation broke, wherein his eye Compassed Affirmative Truths, which lay distinct, In several orders lucidly combined, And tangible by thought if not by words. Then finally his soul was introduced To that Clear Darkness, which the Saints so name Because the abounding light of Heaven obscures Our helpless reason, blinds our keenest thoughts, Buries our faith, and overlays the will, And through its dim confusing splendour gives Some joyous cognizance of Things Divine, Places and Persons, Names and Vocal Sounds,â Till in her Passive Union with her Lord The soul, long waiting, years ago betrothed, Keeping her plighted troth by strictest acts Of diligent penance and ascetic love, Finds her sweet Bridal Hour come unawares, And Heaven begun ere Earth is passed away! Such were the joys that now engrossed the months Which followed his forgiveness by the Church, Joys, which in that forgiveness only found Their lawful root; and every passing week Beheld a change come o'er his bodily frame. We might believe it was the will of Heaven By its immediate and upholding Hand, Foregoing usual customs, to confine The life within his frame, where health and strength Their strongholds had forsaken and betrayed, Until the work of grace was now complete, The penance done, the sinner reconciled, The individual soul, with travail long And dark and dubious, born unto the Church A second time with new baptismal life From out that cloudy Font, by love reserved For such as forfeited by mortal sin The sweet adoption of the Watery Birth, And facile grace so freely there consigned. For now without apparent cause of age Or sickness, as if that sustaining Hand Had been withdrawn, by some invisible vents His life ebbed from him gently like a stream. Prayer and the feeble breathings of his praise, The weariness of rapture in his heart Immured, the speechless fervour of his joy, The very murmurs of the placid sea, The very tolling of the abbey bells, The very pulses of the summer day, The very tingling of the starry nights, Preyed on his life, and seemed with silent shocks To disembarrass his impatient soul Of its half ruined tenement of flesh. Some portion of his perishable life Now daily grew eternal: no one hour Straitened or held the solemn act of death: But immortality in vases caught His life as it was spilled, a silent scene Of mystery: the ocean never ebbed So silently as did that vital stream. Towards the close of an October day, St. Denys' Eve, which seemed for warmth to be An afterthought of summer, from that Seat Within the stone alcove Sir Lancelot watched The bright and early sunset: all around A soft pathetic brilliance overspread The autumnal scene, such splendour as befits The days which through the immediate gates of night Withdraw, and earth her welcome hour no more Within the roseate antechamber waits Of painted twilight. Not a sound was heard, Which intercepted from the listening ear The deep tranquillity of earth, and sky, And the bright plain of sea: a drowsy hum From the faint ivy-flowers that fringed the wall,â The autumnal banquet of the languid bees,â A quickening in the murmur of the waves From Walney Meetings where the clashing tides Are locked in mutual eddies,âthese were sounds With no intrusive power to dispossess The patient sense of that celestial calm. The wooded hill sloped seaward from the brow Where the Monk's Chair was placed: a broad expanse Of tinted foliage lay upon the right; A wilderness of yellow birch it was With vivid searlet delicately veined Or spotted, as the birds had dropped the seed Of the wild cherry whose ensanguined leaves Flamed in the sunset, while the fir-tree domes Of everlasting green came floating up, Like clouds, from out the depths of underwood. Westward, but with a radiant strait between, The Isle of Walney to the sandy skirts Of the low mainland clung, a counterscarp By nature reared against the leaning sea To guard the monks' peninsula, and then, Though treeless now, it was a wall of wood That from the water rose, and ever fell Eastward, or in the act of falling seemed, With such continuous pressure was the hand Of the wild-blowing west detained thereon. And down the glittering channel was an eye Of golden sand, a smooth and wave-girt ring, Surmounted by a coronet of rock, The shoal of Fouldrey, where the flocking gulls With mournful cries their nightly councils held, For human habitation then unclaimed. There now, its age of pride and glory past, In slow decay the abbot's mouldering pile Fights with the winds and waves, the rude allies Of time, and still their joint assaults resists. A touching solitude it is, beheld Through the grey sea-fogs looming, like the wreck Of some huge ship to those who roam far off In Furness by the Druid's hoary ring On Birkrigg, or the groves of Aldingham, Or heights that guard fair Urswick's reedy pool, The quiet haunt of silky-feathered coots, Or those who try the perilous ascent Of Gleaston's crazy towers;âmore mournful still That isolated ruin will appear, When in the cold illumination lost Of sunset, on the line of sandhills poured And dreary leagues of wet and furrowed beach, With some poor fishing vessels laid aslant Among the slimy stones beneath the pile: Or at full sea more melancholy still, At dead of night, when on the waves below The moonbeams through the vacant crennels play In tremulous agitation, while for hours Doth ocean, like Penelope of old, Weave and unweave those threads of silver light, And at pale dawn upon the watery loom Where be the signs of that nocturnal toil? All things around their usual aspect wore, An exquisite, and yet most common, peace. But there was something in that evening sky, A trouble of red light, that would arrest And overawe the heart whose varying moods By natural signs through simple love were steered. Somewhat of pathos was there, intermixed In that solemnity with which the sun Went to his setting, something I would call Portentous, that might tranquillize the mind Through timorous expectation. From his chair Sir Lancelot looked out upon the sea. The sun was veiled behind a heavy cloud, Which hung above the water with a space Of light between the ocean and itself, That seemed to burn with tongues of shooting flame, An endless, endless distance to the west; And sable bars of dusky vapour shot Athwart the abyss of gold, while up the vale, The hollow vale of Duddon, in a gloom Of misty purple shadow far withdrawn, There ran a single line of sullen light Where the cold sea an entrance found, and there Behind the frowning portals of the gorge Was lost to view; even as the closing grave Screens from all eyes, save only those of faith, The track where passing souls prolong their flight: A melancholy type, not unobserved By him whose mind for many a month had been Tinged with the solemn thoughts of death. And yet There wanted not a truer image far Of that dread passage, in the glory stretched Across the infinite illumined sea, And in the golden mountain-tops that formed The radiant distance where old Mona lay Right in the bosom of the setting sun. He looked until his eyes were dimmed with tears, Such thoughts that glory stirred; and bodily strength Appeared to go forth from him as he gazed, Drained from his eyes by that surpassing light Whose sweet compulsion had drawn up those tears. It seemed as if that natural pomp had been A silent incantation which had power To evoke the spirit from its earthly frame, Worn and decayed by too much fellowship With the outward elements, and wet and cold And blinding mists that on high summits dwell: Though he had stood amongst them like the rock That fronts the innocuous fury of the waves, And, to appearance, flung the damps and storms From off his temperate health as from a shield. Now with the radiant vision overpowered, Sir Lancelot leaned, half swooning, on his staff, Which was an ill-shaped Cross of ruddy yew By nature framed, through chance or through design, As men may deem material forms endowed With spirit, and capricious growths o'er-ruled To be suggestive to the feeling heart; And on the staff the knight from Holy Writ, A Latin legend carved, whose import wasâ `We justly bear the Cross because therein `We bear the harvest of our deeds, but nought âWas done amiss by Him who bore it first.â From the sea-shore there wandered at that hour A poor half-witted boy, with long white hair And eyes with wild unmeaning lustre bright, Well known in Furness as the Lucky Guy. His days, as ever seems to be the wont Of those in his sad plight, in open air Among the woods and flowery lanes were passed. Nor wanted he an office that might yield To his poor parents some return of gain, Beyond the dole which at the abbey door On Fridays he received, when Father Hugh Gave him his blessing, and with kindly thought, Long baffled, showed him how to sign the Cross. Oft in the fields near Hawcoat was he seen In the close centre of a hollow bush, With head and hands apparent, and a ring Of eager sheep that gathered round the spot, While he flung down the juicy shoots, and peered From out his nest to watch the greedy strife, And clapped his hands, and with a shrill delight Chuckled to see the passions that displaced The quiet nature of the patient flock. And many a time did his pleased mother hear The neighbours round good-naturedly complain That Guy with covetous diligence was first To rifle all the summer's tender growth Upon the trees, and at the halls and towers From Morecambe Bay to Ulpha, and the Grange By Waberthwaite, where dwelt St. Michael's clerk, While flesh of sheep on sprigs of holly fed More than the fatted buck was prized, the flock Of Guy's own tending was the most in quest. And when the vexed Atlantic after storms Subsided to its heavy swell, a toil Of different sort was his, upon the shore To cull the fans of rosy carrageen, Which from the Irish rocks the fretting tide Had chafed, and, with a single handful rich, The booty of a long day's search he then To Father Jocelyn at the Abbey sold, Who by his ghostly blessing turned it white, So Guy believed, and in the holy hands Of that pure-hearted lover of the herbs And the cool simples, that poor ocean weed An angel held and gained a wondrous power, As Paul of Elliscales could well attest, Or Cicely of the farm on Goldmire Green, To banish pining weakness from the limbs And prop the body up as on a staff. Next to his mother there was none on earth, Save Father Hugh perchance, whom Guy had loved More than Sir Lancelot, in the three short months Of their acquaintance; for the boy discerned Between the greeting of the rustics pitched Somewhere 'twixt mirth and kindness, and the voice And gentle bearing of the well-born Knight; Who oft would aid him when upon the sand With painful stoop he gleaned the precious weed, While to the wonder-stricken youth he spoke Of the Great God upon that blank sea-side In ways that bred a pleasurable awe And inward stirring of his thoughts, which was Akin to reason, and enough for prayer. When Guy beheld Sir Lancelot on his staff In attitude of pain or awkward sleep, He dropped his bunch of carrageen, and raised The feeble man against the stone alcove. Sir Lancelot spoke not, but he smiled his thanks, And gazed once more upon the setting sun. The orb now rested on the burnished waves Alone and disencumbered, not a mote Of fleecy cloud in transit o'er its face. And from the sunken vale behind there rose In bland pulsations on the quiet air Saint Mary's vesper bell; toll after toll In modulated melancholy came, Borne seaward on the breeze: and simple Guy Who saw the sinking sun, the dying man, And heard the plaining bell, not wrongly deemed All meant alike, all were harmonious parts Of some most touching pageant, for the love Of God and Jesus celebrated there. Still the Knight gazed upon the setting sun: It seemed as if from out that radiant fount He quaffed the golden light with thirsty sense, So earnestly he gazed, till like a tide, An influx of eternity, it rose Upon his mortal nature more and more With placid might, until from every depth Of his terrestrial being it dislodged The feeble remnants of his strength, and thence With bodily thrills of deep adoring love The spirit from its trammels disengaged: And while he sank in that poor stripling's arms, His hands devoutly on his bosom crossed, 'Twas rather immortality than death Which was the first to win his life. He passed, A passage painless as the gates of sleep, A wafture like an Angel's even wing, What time the vesper summons ceased to toll And with its last vibration o'er the sea Ran till it touched the silent thrilling orb,â Whereat the latest rim of setting sun Pausedâand went down beneath the line of waves,â And with an after-flash that shot on high Seemed like an Arm of Light that beckoned him;â No soul was e'er more gently dispossessed! How tranquilly the mild sea-murmur comes This balmy day to try the echoing tones Of great Black Combe! A tender voice it is, And with sweet feeling doth accompany The wind, that wild and wayward organist Who o'er the huge sonorous hill presides, And ever plays to yon responsive sea Low dirgelike music; or with troubled keys Loud voluntaries, passionately struck, Ruffle the mane of ocean as the storm Rolls upward, winding his terrific blast Which frets the purple plain with snowy spray. But now, methinks, in tender concert joined, The shadowy Mountain with its neighbouring Sea Would fain essay on my behalf a dirge, A requiem for the lone Sir Lancelot,â That wandering Presence unforgotten yet Upon the silent summit of the hill, Late, at the truthful bidding of my thoughts, So oft environed by his restless feet, So often vocal with his prayer or praise. Spirit! in whose companionship my mind For days of meditative love hath been, O with what true compassion have I burned For thine invented griefs, with what a heart Of sympathy have I been wrought to tears, And to hot rising thoughts more sharp than tears, In musing o'er thy weariness, thy months Of self-accusing penance, and thy joys,â The sacred Image granted to thine eye Of Jesus, and the timorous approach Of thine affections to the Mother Maid, The ritual Cross, and depth of sacrament Laid up unheeded in the common gift Of speech whereby we name the special Name Which stirs high Heaven and shakes the bolts of hell, The Keys of Absolution in thy soul Revolving sensibly, the vocal Dead Into sweet contact coming with thy prayers, The Angelic Ladders which to thy pure eye Broke forth, obscuring all the solemn types Of things inanimate, and blossoming In steplike forms and luminous ascents From out the apparent poverty of earth! Witness, ye cornices of mountain rock! Where I have murmured verses by the hour, Ye winds! on which my voice hath oft been raised With tremulous feeling, and, ye waterfalls! Which interwove your music with my strains;â Witness, thou quiet-lapsing Nen, and fields Belted with silent steeples, like a ring Of citadels to keep low thoughts away,â Choice haunt of rural silence, undisturbed Save by the infrequent boatman's song, or plaint, For let us not misname it noisy mirth, Of corncrake, its monotonous vespers singing, In the concealment of the meadow-grass!â Or those much-cherished colonists, a pair Of turtle-doves, with their soft woodland notes Deepening so unaccountably the calm, The summer-calm of those most pastoral banks!â Witness, if with unfeeling pains of art, Or if with idle purpose I have sung This lofty song, or dared to press the keys Of spiritual music with an awe Less deep than that wherewith a serious man Upon a week-day in an empty Church Bids the loud organ speak, and calls the stones To echo worship when the lips of men Are silent, and, with frequent change of tune, Oft like hushed breezes sinking self-subdued, Plays to the Altar and the Angels there! Spirit! which I have summoned from the Past, (Freedom perchance too bold) and singled out From the great multitude of souls who lie Deep in the bosom of eternal light, Not without purpose have I dared to think, To speak, for those of that departed Age, Investing them through thee with such a light As hath to mine own conscience been a lamp, And might enlarge the hearts of those I love, If God so further mine unworthy verse. So have I sung as one who greatly fears Lest the uncouth aspect of his real wish, And urgent clamour of bold words, should scare The hearts he fain would lure unto an end, A mighty end whose safety and whose strength He hath to his own conscience ascertained By inward thought, the test of outward act, And secret anguish of some dreadful hours That leaned their weight on one most feeble truth, Torturing the firmness which they could not break. And if at times the pressure of a thought, Rumours of actual conflict, or the wound Of personal strife, have rent the figured veil, And from its hidden course the indignant song, Weary of its disguise, hath broken forth, With the shrill Present drowning those soft strains Which came refined by distance from the Past, The very fault in minstrel-craft but serves To make the surface of my song reflect, Even as the unconscious mirror of a lake, The shadows of the times, when hardy truth, By poor conventions overlaid, hath dared To emerge above the impediments, and stand Before the unwilling presence of the world, Through deeds which for the moment have appeared To shift the ancient bounds of right and wrong,â Times when the strife 'twixt Earnestness and Forms Hath reached its height, and victory's golden beam Inclines, but hath not absolutely sunk. O Hearts of England! loyal, good and true, Lovers of home beyond all other men, Yet without homes for your uncertain souls,â Forgive me, if from out my happy home Of faith that hath forgotten how to doubt, In hopeful love one counsel more I give. Simplicity is ever nigh to Truth, And hath a royal road thereto,âa road Better than long inductions, and the lore Of coarse disdainful polemics, and steps, Hardly and separately won, of proofs And disentangled doubts,âa royal road Which if ye humbly tread, why should ye fear Though Conscience with infallible constraints, Turning your faces homeward, bring your steps Back to the foot of Peter's Sovran Chair? THE END.</field>
