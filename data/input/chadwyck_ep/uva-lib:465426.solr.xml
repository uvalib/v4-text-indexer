      <field name="fulltext">[VOL. I.] TIBULLUS. BOOK THE FIRST. ELEGY THE FIRST. [The glitt'ring Ore let others vainly heap] The glitt'ring Ore let others vainly heap, O'er fertile Vales extend th'inclosing Mound; With dread of neighb'ring Foes forsake their Sleep, And start aghast at ev'ry Trumpet's Sound. Me humbler Scenes delight, and calmer Days; A tranquil Life fair Poverty secure! Then boast, my Hearth, a small but cheerful Blaze, And Riches grasp who will, let me be poor. Nor yet be Hope a Stranger to my Door, But o'er my Roof, bright Goddess, still preside! With many a bounteous Autumn heap my Floor, And swell my Vats with Must, a purple Tide. My tender Vines I'll plant with early Care, And choicest Apples, with a skilful Hand; Nor blush, a Rustic, oft to guide the Share, Or goad the tardy Ox along the Land. Let me, a simple Swain, with honest Pride, If chance a Lambkin from its Dam should roam, Or sportful Kid, the little Wanderer chide, And in my Bosom bear exulting Home. Here Pales I bedew with milky Show'rs, Lustrations yearly for my Shepherd pay, Revere each antique Stone bedeck'd with Flow'rs That bounds the Field, or points the doubtful Way. My grateful Fruits, the earliest of the Year, Before the rural God shall duly wait. From Ceres' Gifts I'll cull each browner Ear, And hang a wheaten Wreath before her Gate. The ruddy God shall save my Fruit from stealth, And far away each little Plund'rer scare: And you, the Guardians once of ampler Wealth, My household Gods, shall still my Off'rings share. My num'rous Herds, that wanton'd o'er the Mead, The choicest Fatling then could richly yield; Now scarce I spare a little Lamb to bleed A mighty Victim for my scanty Field. And yet a Lamb shall bleed, while, rang'd around, The Village Youths shall stand in Order meet, With rustic Hymns, ye Gods, your Praise resound, And future Crops and future Wines intreat. Then come, ye Pow'rs, nor scorn my frugal Board, Nor yet the Gifts clean earthen Bowls convey; With these the first of Men the Gods ador'd, And form'd their simple Shape of ductile Clay. My little Flock, ye Wolves, ye Robbers, spare, Too mean a Plunder to deserve your Toil; For wealthier Herds the nightly Theft prepare; There seek a nobler Prey, and richer Spoil. For treasur'd Wealth, nor Stores of golden Wheat, The Hoard of frugal Sires, I vainly call; A little Farm be mine, a Cottage neat And wonted Couch where balmy Sleep may fall. “What Joy to hear the Tempest howl in vain, “And clasp a fearful Mistress to my Breast: “Or lull'd to Slumber by the beating Rain, “Secure and happy sink at last to rest.” These Joys be mine!—O grant me only these, And give to others Bags of shining Gold, Whose steely Heart can brave the boist'rous Seas, The Storm wide-wasting, or the stiffning Cold. Content with little, I would rather stay Than spend long Months amid the watry Waste: In cooling Shades elude the scorching Ray Beside some Fountain's gliding Waters plac'd. O perish rather all that's rich and rare, The diamond Quarry, and the golden Vein, Than that my Absence cost one precious Tear, Or give some gentle Maid a Moment's Pain. With Glitt'ring Spoils, Messala, gild thy Dome, Be thine the noble Task to lead the Brave: A lovely Foe me captive holds at Home, Chain'd to her scornful Gate, a watchful Slave. Inglorious Post!—And yet I heed not Fame: Th'Applause of Crouds for Delia I'd resign: To live with thee I'd bear the Coward's Name, Nor 'midst the Scorn of Nations once repine. With thee to live I'd mock the Plowman's Toil, Or on some lonely Mountain tend my Sheep; At Night I'd lay me on the flinty Soil, And happy 'midst thy dear Embraces sleep. What drooping Lover heeds the Tyrian Bed, While the long Night is pass'd with many a Sigh: Nor softest Down with richest Carpets spread, Nor whisp'ring Rills, can close the weeping Eye. Of threefold Iron were his rugged Frame, Who when he might thy yielding Heart obtain, Could yet attend the Calls of empty Fame, Or follow Arms in quest of sordid Gain. Unenvy'd let him drive the vanquish'd Host, Thro' captive Lands his conquering Armies lead; Unenvy'd wear the Robe with Gold imboss'd, And guide with solemn State his foaming Steed. O may I view thee with Life's parting Ray, And thy dear Hand with dying Ardor press: Sure thou wilt weep—and on thy Lover's Clay, With breaking Heart, print many a tender Kiss! Sure thou wilt weep—and Woes unutter'd feel, When on the Pile thou seest thy Lover laid! For well I know, nor Flint, nor ruthless Steel, Can arm the Breast of such a gentle Maid. From the sad Pomp, what Youth, what pitying Fair, Returning slow can tender Tears refrain? O Delia, spare thy Cheeks, thy Tresses spare, Nor give my ling'ring Shade a World of Pain. But now while smiling Hours the Fates bestow, Let Love, dear Maid, our gentle Hearts unite! Soon Death will come and strike the fatal Blow; Unseen his Head, and veil'd in Shades of Night. Soon creeping Age will bow the Lover's Frame, And tear the myrtle Chaplet from his Brow: With hoary Locks ill suits the youthful Flame, The soft Persuasion, or the ardent Vow. Now the fair Queen of gay Desire is ours, And lends our Follies an indulgent Smile: 'Tis lavish Youth's t'enjoy the frolick Hours, The wanton Revel and the midnight Broil. Your Chief, my Friends, and Fellow-soldier, I To these light Wars will lead you boldly on: Far hence ye Trumpets sound and Banners fly: To those who covet Wounds and Fame begone. And bear them Fame and Wounds; and Riches bear; There are that Fame and Wounds and Riches prize. For me, while I possess one plenteous Year, I'll Wealth and meagre Want alike despise. THE SECOND ELEGY. [With Wine, more Wine, my recent Pains deceive] With Wine, more Wine, my recent Pains deceive, Till creeping Slumber send a soft Reprieve: Asleep, take heed no Whisper stirs the Air, For wak'd, my Boy, I wake to heart-felt Care. Now is my Delia watch'd by ruthless Spies, And the Gate, bolted, all Access denies. Relentless Gate! may Storms of Wind and Rain, With mingled Violence avenge my Pain! May forky Thunders, hurl'd by Jove's red Hand, Burst every Bolt, and shatter every Band! Ah no! Rage turns my Brain; the Curse recall; On me, devoted, let the Thunder fall! Then recollect my many Wreaths of Yore, How oft you've seen me weep, insensate Door! No longer then our Interview delay, And as you open let no Noise betray. In vain I plead!—Dare then my Delia rise! Love aids the Dauntless, and will blind your Spies! Those who the Godhead's soft Behests obey, Steal from their Pillows unobserv'd away; On tiptoe traverse unobserv'd the Floor; The Key turn noiseless, and unfold the Door: In vain the jealous each Precaution take, Their speaking Fingers Assignations make. Nor will the God impart to all his Aid: Love hates the fearful, hates the lazy Maid; But through sly Windings, and unpractis'd Ways, His bold Night-Errants to their Wish conveys: For those whom He with Expectation fires, No Ambush frightens, and no Labour tires; Sacred the Dangers of the Dark they dare, No Robbers stop them, and no Bravoes scare. Tho' wintery Tempests howl, by Love secure, The howling Tempest I with ease endure: No watching hurts me, if my Delia smile, Soft turn the Gate, and beckon me the while. She's mine. Be blind, ye Ramblers of the Night, Lest angry Venus snatch your guilty Sight: The Goddess bids her Votaries Joys to be From every casual Interruption free: With prying Steps alarm us not, retire, Nor glare your Torches, nor our Names enquire: Or if ye know, deny, by Heaven above, Nor dare divulge the Privacies of Love. From Blood and Seas vindictive Venus sprung, And sure Destruction waits the blabbing Tongue! Nay, should they prate, you, Delia, need not fear; Your Lord, (a Sorceress swore,) should give no Ear! By potent Spells she cleaves the sacred Ground, And shuddering Spectres wildly roam around! I've seen her tear the Planets from the Sky! Seen Lightning backward at her Bidding fly! She calls! from blazing Pyres the Corse descends, And, re-enliven'd, clasps his wondering Friends! The Fiends she gathers with a magic Yell, Then with Aspersions frights them back to Hell! She wills,—glad Summer gilds the frozen Pole! She wills,—in Summer wintery Tempests roll! She knows, ('tis true,) Medea's awful Spell! She knows to vanquish the fierce Guards of Hell! To me she gave a Charm for Lovers meet, (“Spit thrice, my Fair, and thrice the Charm repeat.”) Us, in soft Dalliance should your Lord surprize; By this impos'd on he'd renounce his Eyes! But bless no Rival, or th'Affair is known; This Incantation me befriends alone. Nor stopp'd she here; but swore, if I'd agree, By Charms or Herbs to set thy Lover free. With dire Lustrations she began the Rite! (Serenely shone the Planet of the Night) The magic Gods she call'd with hellish sound, A sable Sacrifice distain'd the Ground— I stopp'd the Spell: I must not, cannot part: I begg'd her Aid to gain a mutual Heart. THE THIRD ELEGY. [While you, Messala, plough th'Ægean Sea] While you, Messala, plough th'Ægean Sea, O sometimes kindly deign to think of me: Me, hapless me, Phæacian Shores detain, Unknown, unpitied, and oppress'd with Pain. Yet spare me, Death, ah spare me and retire: No weeping Mother's here to light my Pyre: Here is no Sister, with a Sister's Woe, Rich Syrian Odors on the Pile to throw: But chief, my Soul's soft Partner is not here, Her Locks to loose, and sorrow o'er my Bier. What tho' fair Delia my Return implor'd, Each Fane frequented, and each God ador'd: What tho' they bade me every Peril brave; And Fortune thrice auspicious Omens gave; All could not dry my tender Delia's Tears, Suppress her Sighs, or calm her anxious Fears; E'en as I strove to minister Relief, Unconscious Tears proclaim'd my heart-felt Grief: Urg'd still to go, a thousand Shifts I made, Birds now, now Festivals my Voyage staid: Or, if I struck my Foot against the Door, Strait I return'd, and Wisdom was no more. Forbid by Cupid, let no Swain depart, Cupid is vengeful, and will wring his Heart. What do your Offerings now, my Fair, avail? Your Isis heeds not, and your Cymbals fail! What, though array'd in sacred Robes you stood, Fled Man's Embrace, and sought the purest Flood? While this I write, I sensibly decay,— “Assist me, Isis, drive my Pains away: “That you can every mortall Ill remove, “The numerous Tablets in your Temple prove: “So shall my Delia, veil'd in votive White, “Before your Threshold sit for many a Night; “And twice a Day, her Tresses all unbound, “Amid your Votaries fam'd, your Praises sound: “Safe to my household Gods may I return, “And Incense monthly on their Altars burn.” How blest Man liv'd in Saturn's golden Days, E'er distant Climes were join'd by lengthned Ways. Secure the Pine upon the Mountain grew, Nor yet o'er Billows in the Ocean flew; Then every Clime a wild Abundance bore, And Man liv'd happy on his natal Shore: For then no Steed to feel the Bit was broke, Then had no Steer submitted to the Yoke; No House had Gates, (blest Times!) and, in the Grounds No scanty Landmarks parcell'd out the Bounds: From every Oak redundant Honey ran, And Ewes spontaneous bore their Milk to Man: No deathful Arms were forg'd, no War was wag'd, No Rapine plunder'd, no Ambition rag'd. How chang'd, alas! Now cruel Jove commands; Gold fires the Soul, and Falchions arm our Hands: Each Day, the Main unnumber'd Lives destroys; And Slaughter, daily, o'er her Myriads joys. Yet spare me, Jove, I ne'er disown'd thy Sway, I ne'er was perjur'd; spare me, Jove, I pray. But, if the Sisters have pronounc'd my Doom, Inscrib'd be these upon my humble Tomb. “Lo! here inurn'd a youthful Poet lies, “Far from his Delia, and his native Skies! “Far from the lov'd Messala, whom to please “Tibullus follow'd over Land and Seas.” Then Love my Ghost (for Love I still obey'd) Will grateful usher to th'Elysian Shade: There Joy and ceaseless Revelry prevail; There soothing Musick floats on every Gale; There painted Warblers hop from Spray to Spray, And, wildly-pleasing, swell the general Lay: There every Hedge, untaught, with Cassia blooms, And scents the ambient Air with rich Perfumes: There every Mead a various Plenty yields; There lavish Flora paints the purple Fields: With ceaseless Light a brighter Phœbus glows, No Sickness tortures, and no Ocean flows; But Youths associate with the gentle Fair, And stung with Pleasure to the Shade repair: With them Love wanders wheresoe'er they stray, Provokes to Rapture, and inflames the Play: But chief, the constant Few, by Death betray'd, Reign, crown'd with Myrtle, Monarchs of the Shade. Not so the Wicked; far they drag their Chains, By black Lakes sever'd from the blissful Plains; Those should they pass, impassable the Gate Where Cerb'rus howls, grim Sentinel of Fate. There snake-hair'd Fiends with Whips patrole around, Rack'd Anguish bellows, and the Deeps resound: There he, who dar'd to tempt the Queen of Heaven, Upon an ever-turning Wheel is driven: The Danaids there, still strive huge Casks to fill, But strive in vain, the Casks elude their Skill: There Pelop's Sire, to quench his thirsty Fires, Still tries the Flood, and still the Flood retires: There Vulturs tear the Bow'ls, and drink the Gore, Of Tityus, stretch'd enormous on the Shore. Dread Love, as vast as endless be their Pain Who tempt my Fair, or wish a long Campaign. O let no Rival your Affections share, Long as this Bosom beats, my lovely Fair! Still on you let your prudent Nurse attend; She'll guard your Honour, she's our common Friend. Her Tales of Love your Sorrowings will allay, And, in my Absence, make my Delia gay: Let her o'er all your Virgin-train preside, She'll praise th'Industrious, and the Lazy chide. But see! on all enfeebling Languors creep; Their Distaffs drop, they yawn, they nod, they sleep. Then, if the Destinies propitious prove, Then will I rush, all Passion, on my Love: My wish'd Return no Messenger shall tell, I'll seem, my Fair, as if from Heaven I fell. A soft Confusion flushes all your Charms, Your graceful Dishabille my Bosom warms, You, Delia, fly and clasp me in your Arms. For this Surprize, ye Powers of Love, I pray, Post on Aurora, bring the rosy Day. THE FOURTH ELEGY. [So round, my God, may shady Coverings bend] Poet. So round, my God, may shady Coverings bend, No Sun-beams scorch thy Face, no Snows offend! Whence are the Fair so proud to win thy Heart, Yet rude thy Beard, and guiltless thou of Art? Naked thou stand'st, expos'd to wintery Snows! Naked thou stand'st when burning Sirius glows! Thus I—and thus the Garden-Power reply'd, A crooked Sickle glittering by his Side. Priapus. Take no Repulse—at first what tho' they fly! O'ercome at last, Reluctance will comply. The Vine in Time full ripen'd Clusters bears, And circling Time brings back the rolling Spheres: In Time soft Rains thro' Marble sap their Way, And Time taught Man to tame fierce Beasts of Prey. Nor aw'd by Conscience meanly dread to swear; Love-oaths, unratify'd, wild Tempests bear! Banish then Scruples, if you'd gain a Heart; Swear, swear by Pallas' Locks, Diana's Dart; By all that's most rever'd—if they require: Oaths bind not eager Love, thank Heaven's good Sire! Nor be too slow; your Slowness you'll deplore; Time posts; and, oh! Youth's Raptures soon are o'er: Now Forests bloom, and purple Earth looks gay; Bleak Winter blows, and all her Charms decay: How soon the Steed to Age's Stiffness yields, So late a Victor in th'Olympic Fields? I've seen the Aged oft lament their Fate, That senseless they had learnt to live too late. Ye partial Gods, and can the Snake renew, His youthful Vigour and his burnish'd Hue? But Youth and Beauty past; is art in vain To bring the coy Deserters back again? Poet. Jove gives alone the Powers of Wit and Wine, In Youth immortal, spite of Years, to shine. Priapus. Yield prompt Compliance to the Maid's Desires; A prompt Compliance fans the Lover's Fires: Go pleas'd where'er she goes, tho' long the Way, Tho' the fierce Dog-Star dart his sultry Ray; Tho' painted Iris gird the bluish Sky, And sure portends, that ratling Storms are nigh: Or, if the Fair-one pant for sylvan Fame, Gay drag the Meshes, and provoke the Game: Nay, should she chuse to risk the driving Gale; Or steer, or row, or agile hand the Sail: No Toil, tho' weak, tho' fearful, thou forbear; No Toils should tire you, and no Dangers scare: Occasion smiles, then snatch an ardent Kiss; The Coy may struggle, but will grant the Bliss: The Bliss obtain'd, the fictious Struggle past; Unbid, they'll clasp you in their Arms at last. Poet. Alas! in such degenerate Days as these, No more Love's gentle Wiles the Beauteous please! If poor, all gentle Stratagems are vain! The Fair-one's languish now alone for Gain! O may Dishonour be the Wretch's Share, Who first with hateful Gold seduc'd the Fair! Priapus. Ye charming Dames, prefer the tuneful Quire, Nor meanly barter heavenly Charms for Hire. What cannot Song? The purple Locks that glow'd On Nisus' Head, harmonious Song bestow'd! What cannot Strains? By tuneful Strains alone Fair Iv'ry, Pelops, on thy Shoulder shone! While Stars with nightly Radiance gild the Pole, Earth boasts her Oaks, or mighty Waters roll, The Fair, whose Beauty Poets deign to praise, Shall bloom uninjur'd in poetic Lays: While she who hears not when the Muses call, But flies their Fav'rites, Gold's inglorious Thrall! Shall prove, believe the Bard, or soon, or late, A dread Example of avenging Fate! Soft, flattering Songs, the Cyprian Queen approves; And aids the suppliant Swain with all her Loves. Poet. The God, no Novice in th'intriguing Trade, This Answer, Titius, to my Question made: But Caution bids you fly th'insidious Fair, And paints the Perils of their Eyes and Air; Nor these alone, devoted Man subdue, Devoted Man their slighest Actions woo. Be cautious those who list—but ye who know Desire's hot Fever, and Contempt's chill Woe; Me grateful praise—Contempt shall pain no more; But Wish meet Wish, instructed by my Lore: By various Means, while others seek for Fame, Scorn'd Love to counsel be my noblest Aim. Wide stands my Gate for all—I rapt foresee The Time, when I Love's Oracle shall be! When round my Seat shall press th'enamour'd Throng. Attend my Motions, and applaud my Song. Alas! my Hopes are fled, my Wiles are vain; The Fair, I doat on, treats me with Disdain: Yet spair me, Charmer, your Disdain betrays To witty Laughter my too boastful Lays. THE FIFTH ELEGY. [Of late I boasted I could happy be] Of late I boasted I could happy be, Resume the Man, and not my Delia see! My boasts of Manhood boasts of Bliss are vain; Back to my Bondage I return again! And like a Top am whirl'd, which Boys, for Sport. Lash on the Pavement of a level Court! What can attone, my Fair, for Crimes like these? I'll bear with Patience, use me as you please! Yet, by Love's Shafts, and by your braided Hair, By all the Joys we stole, your Suppliant spare. When Sickness dimm'd, of late, your radiant Eyes; My restless, fond Petitions won the Skies. Thrice I with Sulphur purified you round, And thrice the Rite, with Songs, th'Enchantress bound: The Cake, by me thrice sprinkled, put to flight The death-denouncing Phantoms of the Night: And I nine Times, in linnen Garbs array'd, In silent Night, nine Times to Trivia pray'd. What did I not? Yet what Reward have I? You love another, your Preserver fly! He tastes the sweet Effects of all my Cares, My fond Lustrations, and my solemn Prayers. Are these the Joys my madding Fancy drew, If young-ey'd Health restor'd your rosy Hue? I fondly thought, sweet Maid, oh thought in vain! With you to live a blythsome Village-swain. When yellow Ceres asks the Reaper's Hand, Delia (said I) will guard the Reaper's Band; Delia will keep, when Hinds unload the Vine, The choicest Grapes for me, the richest Wine: My Flocks she'll count, and oft will sweetly deign To clasp some Pratler of my menial Train: With pious Care will load each rural Shrine, For ripen'd Crops a golden Sheaf assign, Cates for my Fold, rich Clusters for my Vine: No, no domestic Care shall touch my Soul; You, Delia, reign despotic o'er the Whole! And will Messala fly from Pomp of State, And deign to enter at my lowly Gate? The choicest Fruitage, that my Trees afford, Delia will cull herself, to deck the Board; And wondering, such transcendant Worth to see, The Fruit present, thy blushing Hand-maid she. Such were the sond Chimeras of my Brain, Which now the Winds have wafted o'er the Main. O Power of Love, whom still my Soul obey'd, What has my Tongue against thy Mother said? Guiltless of Ill, unmark'd with Incest's Stain, I stole no Garland from her holy Fane: For Crimes, like these, I'd abject crawl the Ground, Kiss her dread Threshold, and my Forehead wound. But ye who, falsely wise, deride my Pains, Beware; your Hour approaches—Love has Chains. I've known the Young, who ridicul'd his Rage; Love's humblest Vassals, when oppress'd with Age: Each Art, I've known them try to win the Fair, Smooth their hoarse Voice, and dress their scanty Hair; I've known them, in the Street, her Maid detain; And weeping, beg her to assist their Pain. At such preposterous Love, each School-boy sneers: Shuns, as an Omen; or pursues with Fleers. Why do you crush your Slave, fair Queen of Joy? Destroying me, your Harvest you destroy! THE SIXTH ELEGY. [With Wine, I strove to sooth my Love-sick Soul] With Wine, I strove to sooth my Love-sick Soul, But vengeful Cupid dash'd with Tears the Bowl: All mad with Rage, to kinder Nymphs I flew; But Vigour fled me, when I thought on you. Balk'd of the Rapture, from my Arms they run, Swear I'm devoted, and my Converse shun! By what dire Witchcraft am I thus betray'd? Your Face and Hair unnerve me, matchless Maid: Not more celestial look'd the Sea-born Fair, Receiv'd by Peleus from her pearly Chair. A rich Admirer his Addresses paid; And brib'd my Mistress by a Beldam's Aid. From you my ruin, curst Procuress, rose; What Imprecations shall avenge my Woes? May Heaven, in pity to my Sufferings, shed Its keenest Mischief on your plotting Head! The Ghosts of those, you robb'd of Love's delight, In horrid Visions haunt your irksome Night! And, on the Chimney, may the boding Owl Your Rest disturb, and terrify your Soul! By Famine stung, to Church-yards may you run; There, feast on Offals, hungry Wolves would shun! Or howling frantic, in a tatter'd Gown; Fierce Mastiffs bate you thro' each crowded Town! 'Tis done! a Lover's Curse the Gods approve; But keenest Vengeance fires the Queen of Love. Leave then, my Fair, the crafty venal Jade; What Passion yields not, when such Foes invade? Your Hearts, ye Fair, does modest Merit claim? Tho' small his Fortunes, feed his gentle Flame; For, genuin Love's soft Raptures would ye know? These Raptures Merit can alone bestow: The Sons of Opulence are Folly's Care, But Want's rough Child is Sense, and Honour's Heir. In vain we sing—the Gate still bolted stands; Come, Vengeance, let us burst its sullen Bands. Learn, happy Rival, by my Wrongs to know Your Fate; since Fortune governs all below. THE SEVENTH ELEGY. [Love still invites me with a smiling Eye!] Love still invites me with a smiling Eye! Beneath his Smiles, what Pains and Anguish lye? Yet since the Gods, dread Power, must yield to thee! What Laurels canst thou gain from conquering me? Me Delia lov'd; but by thy subtle Wiles, The Fair, in secret, on another smiles: That my Suspicion's false, 'tis true, she swears; And backs her Imprecations with her Tears! False Fair, your Oaths, and Syren Tears refrain; Your Syren Tears, and Oaths no Credit gain; For when your Lord suspected me of yore, As much you wept, as many Oaths you swore. Yet wherefore blame I Love? the blame is mine; I, wretched I, first taught her to design! I first instructed her, her Spies to foil! Back on myself my wanton Arts recoil: Herbs of rare Energy my Skill supplied, All Marks of too-fond Gallantry to hide! More artful now, alone the wanton Lies; And new Pretexts her cozening Brains devise. Uncautious Lord of a too cunning Spouse! Admittance grant me, she shall keep her Vows! Be warn'd, my Friend, observe her when her Tongue Commends in wanton Phrase the gay-dress'd young; O let her not her heaving Bosom bare, Expos'd to every Fop's immodest Stare. When leaning on the Board, with flowing Wine, She seems to draw some inconsiderate Line; Take heed, take heed, (I know the Warning true) These random Lines assign an Interview. Nor let your Wife to Fanes so frequent roam, A modest Wife's best Temple is at Home: But if your Prohibitions all are vain; Give me the Hint, I'll dodge her to the Fane; What tho' the Goddess snatch my curious Sight, I'll bring her wanton Privacies to light. Some Gem she wore, I'd oft pretend to view, But squeez'd her Fingers unperceiv'd of you: Oft with full racy Bowls I seal'd your Eyes, Water my Bev'ridge, and obtain'd the Prize. Yet since I tell, forgive the Pranks I play'd, Love prompted all, and Love must be obey'd! Nay, 'twas at me (be now the Truth avow'd) Your watchful Mastiff us'd to bark so loud; But now some other, with insidious wait, Intent observes each creaking of your Gate, At which, whoever of the House appears, Passing, the Mein of quick Dispatch he wears; But comes again, the Minute they remove, And coughs, sure Signal of impatient Love! What boots, tho' Marriage gave a Wife so fair, If careless you, or she eludes your Care? While Men are artful, and your Wife can feign, Vain are your Brazen-bolts, your Mastiffs vain. Cold to the Raptures of the genial Bed, She lays the Fault upon an aching Head: 'Tis false; the Wanton for some other Sighs; From this, her Coolness, this, her Aches arise. Then then be warn'd, intrust her to my Care; Whipps, Chains I laugh at, if you grant my Prayer. “Hence from my Ward, ye sparkish essenc'd Beaus; “Illegal Love oft springs from essenc'd Cloaths.” Where'er she walks, not distant I'll attend; And guard your Honour from the casual Friend! “Off, Gallants, off: for so the Gods ordain, “So, the dread Priestess in unerring Strain!” (When holy Fury fires the frantic Dame, She mocks all Torture, and exults in Flame; Her Snow-white Arms and heaving Breast she tears; And with the gushing Gore Bellona smears; Deep in her Side she plants the glittering Sword; And the dread Goddess prompts each fateful Word.) “Ye youths beware, nor touch whom Cupid guards, “Unpunish'd none Attempt his gentle Wards: “As my Blood flows, and as these Ashes fly; “Their wealth shall perish, and their manhood die.” She menac'd then the Fair, with dreadful Pain; E'en were you guilty, may her Threats be vain: Not on your own Account; your Mother's Age, Your worthy Mother, deprecates my Rage: When Love and Fortune smil'd, her gentle Aid Oft me conducted to the blooming Maid; My Foot-steps, wakeful, from a-far she knew, Unbarr'd the Gate, nor fear'd the nightly Dew: Half of my Life's long Thread I'd pleas'd resign, My sweet Conductress, could I lengthen thine! Still, still, tho' much abus'd, I Delia prize; She's still thy Daughter, and enchants my Eyes. Yet tho' no coy Cimarr invest the Fair; Nor vestal Fillet bind her auburn Hair; Teach her what decent Modesty requires; To crown my Fire, alone, with equal Fires. Me too confine; and if, in wanton Praise Of other Maids, my Tongue luxuriant strays; Let thy Suspicion then no Limits know, Insult me, spurn me, as thy greatest Foe! But if your Jealousies are built in Air, And patient Love your Usage cannot bear; What Wrath may perpetrate, my Soul alarms; For Wrath, I warn you, heeds not Female-charms. Nor yet be chaste, from mean unamorous Fear; Be still most modest, when I am not near. For those, whom neither Wit, nor Worth secure, Grow old, unpitied; palsi'd, worthless, poor; Yet with each servile Drudgery they strive, To keep their Being's Wretchedness alive! The gay regard their Woe, with laughing Eyes; Swear they deserve it, and absolve the Skies! Nor Venus less exults! “May such a Fate, (From Heaven she prays) upon th'Inconstant wait.” The same my Wish! but O may we two prove, In Age, a Pattern of unalter'd Love! THE EIGHTH ELEGY. [“This Day, (the Fates foretold in sacred Song] “This Day, (the Fates foretold in sacred Song, And singing drew the vital Twine along) “He comes, nor shall the Gods the Doom recal, “He comes, whose Sword shall quell the Rebel Gaul. “With all her Laurels, him shall Conquest crown, “And Nations shudder at his awful Frown; “Smooth Atur, now that flows through peaceful Lands, “Shall fly affrighted at his hostile Bands.” 'Tis done! this Prophecy, Rome joys to see, Far-fam'd Messala, now fulfill'd in thee: Long Triumphs ravish the Spectators Eyes, And fetter'd Chieftains of enormous Size: An Ivory-car, with Steeds as white as Snow, Sustains thy Grandeur through the pompous Show. Some little Share, in those Exploits, I bore; Witness Tarbella; and the Santoigne Shore; Witness the Land, winding with a silver Soane; Where rush the Garonne; and th'impetuous Rhone; Where Loire, enamour'd of Carnutian Bounds, Leads his blue Water through the yellow Grounds. Or shall His other Acts adorn my Theme;— Fair Cydnus, stealing with a silent Stream? Taurus, that in the Clouds his Fore-head hides, And rich Cilicia from the World divides; Taurus, from which unnumber'd Rivers spring, The savage Seat of Tempests, shall I sing? Why should I tell, how sacred through the Skies Of Syrian Cities, the white Pidgeon flies? Why sing of Tyrian Towers, which Neptune laves; Whence the first Vessel, venturous, stemm'd the Waves? How shall the Bard the secret Source explore, Whence, Father Nile, thou draw'st thy watery Store? Thy Fields ne'er importune for Rain the Sky; Thou dost benignly all their Wants supply: As Egypt, Apis mourns in mystic Lays, She joins thy Praises to Osiris' Praise. Osiris first contriv'd the crooked Plough, And pull'd ripe Apples from the novice Bough; He taught the Swains, the Savage-mould to wound, And scatter'd Seed-corn in th'unpractis'd Ground. He first with Poles sustain'd the reptile Vine, And shew'd its Infant tendrils how to twine; Its wanton Shoots instructed Man to shear, Subdue their Wildness, and mature the Year: Then too, the ripen'd Cluster first was trod; Then in gay Streams its cordial Soul bestow'd; This as Swains quaff'd, spontaneous Numbers came, They prais'd the festal Cask, and hymn'd thy Name; All Ecstacy! to certain Time they bound, And beat in measur'd Aukwardness the Ground. Gay Bowls serene the wrinkled Front of Care; Gay Bowls the toil-oppressed Swain repair! And let the Slave the laughing Goblet drain; He blythsome sings, though Manacles inchain. Thee Sorrow flies, Osiris, God of Wine! But Songs, enchanting Love, and Dance are thine: But Flowers and Ivy thy fair Head surround, And a loose Saffron-mantle sweeps the Ground. With Purple-robes invested, now you glow; The shrine is shewn, and Flutes melodious blow: Come then, my God, but come bedew'd with Wine! Attend the Rites, and in the Dance combine; The Rites and Dances are to Genius due! Benign Osiris, stand confess'd to view! Rich Unguents drop already from his Hair, His Head and Neck soft flowery Garlands share! O come, so shall my grateful Incense rise, And Cates of Honey meet thy laughing Eyes! On thee, Messala ('tis my fervent Prayer) May Heaven bestow a wise, a warlike Heir: In whom, increas'd, paternal Worth may shine, Whose Acts may add a Lustre to thy Line, And Transports give thee in thy Life's decline. But should the Gods my fervent Prayer deny, Thy Fame, my glorious Friend, shall never die. Long as (thy bounteous Work) the well-made Way Shall its broad Pavement to the Sun display. The Bards of Alba shall in lofty Rhyme, Transmit thy Glory down the Tide of Time: They sing from Gratitude: nor less the Clown Whom Love or Business have detain'd in Town Till late, as home he safely plods along, Thee chants, Messala, in his Village-song. Blest Morn, which still my grateful Muse shall sing, Oft rise, and with you greater Blessings bring. THE NINTH ELEGY. [In vain would Lovers hide their Infant-smart] In vain would Lovers hide their Infant-smart, From me a Master in the amorous Art; I read their Passion in their Mein and Eyes, O'er-hear their Whispers, and explain their Sighs. This Skill no Delphian Oracles bestow'd, No Augurs taught me, and no Victims show'd; But Love my Wrists with Magic Fillets bound, Lash'd me, and lashing, mutter'd many a Sound. No more then, Marathus, Indifference feign, Else vengeful Venus will inhance your Pain! What now, sweet Youth, avails your anxious Care, So oft to essence, oft to change your Hair? What tho' Cosmetics all their Aid supply? And every Artifice of Dress you try? She's not oblig'd to Bredes, to Gems, to Cloaths, Her Charms to Nature Pholoe only owes. What Spells devote you? say, what Philtres bind? What Mid-night Sorceress fascinates your Mind? Spells can seduce the Corn from neighbouring Plains! The head-long Serpent halts at Magic Strains! And did not Cymbals stop thy prone Career, A Spell thee Luna from thy Orb would tear! Why do I Magic for your Passion blame, Magic is useless to a perfect Frame! You squees'd her Hands, your Arms around her threw, Join'd Lip to Lip, and hence your Passion grew. Cease then, fair Maid, to give your Lover Pain; Love hates the Haughty, will avenge the Swain. See Youth vermilions o'er his modest Face! Can Riches equal such a Boy's Embrace? Then ask no Bribe—when Age affects the Gay, Your every Smile let hoary Dotage pay; But you your Arms around the Stripling throw, And scorn the Treasure Monarchs can bestow. But she who gives to Age, her Charms, for pay, May her wealth perish, and her Bloom decay. Then when Impatience thrills in every Vein, May Manhood shun her, and the Young disdain. Alas! when Age has silver'd o'er the Head, And Youth that feeds the Lamp of Love is fled, In vain the Toilette charms; 'tis vain to try, Grey scanty Locks with yellow Nuts to die; You strip the Tell-tales vainly from their Place; And vainly strive to mend an aged Face. Then in thine Eyes while Youth triumphant glows, And with his Flowers thy Cheeks my Fair-one sows, Incline thine Heart to Love, and gentle Play, Youth, Youth has rapid Wings, and flies away! The fond old Lover vilify, disdain; What Praise can crown you from a Stripling's Pain? Spare then the lovely Boy; his Beauties die; By no dire Sickness sent him from the Sky: The Gods are just; you, Pholoe, are to blame; His sallow Colour from your Coyness came. Oh, wretched Youth! how oft, when absent you, Groans rend his Breast, and Tears his Cheeks bedew? “Why dost thou rack me with Contempt? he cries, “The willing ever can elude their Spies. “Had you, O had you felt what now I feel, “Venus would teach you from your Spies to steal. “I can breathe low; can snatch the melting Kiss, “And noiseless ravish Loves enchanting Bliss; “At Mid-night I securely grope my Way; “The Floor tread noiseless, noiseless turn the Key. “Poor fruitless Skill! my Skill if she despise, “And cruel from the Bed of Rapture flies. “Or if a Promise haply I obtain, “That she will recompence at Night my Pain; “How am I dup'd? I wakeful listen round, “And think I hear her in each casual Sound. “Perish the Wiles of Love, and Arts of Dress! “In russet Weeds I'll shrowd my Wretchedness. “The Wiles of Love, and Arts of Dress are vain, “My Fair to soften, and Admittance gain.” Youth, weep no more; your Eyes are swoln with Tears; No more complain; for O! she stops her Ears. The Gods, I warn you, hate the haughty Fair, Reject their Incense, and deny their Prayer. This Youth, this Marathus, who wears your Chains, Late laugh'd at Love, and ridicul'd its Pains! Th'impatient Lover in the Street would stay! Nor dreamt that Vengeance would his Crimes repay. Now, now he moans his past Misdeeds with Tears, A Prey to Love, and all its frantic Fears: Now he exclaims at Female-scorn and Hate; And from his Soul abhors a bolted Gate! Like Vengeance waits you; trust th'unerring Muse, If still you're coy, and still Access refuse! Then how you'll wish, when old, contemn'd of all, But vainly wish, these Moments to recall! THE TENTH ELEGY. [Why did you swear by all the Powers above?] Why did you swear by all the Powers above? Yet never meant to crown my longing Love. Wretch, tho' at first the perjur'd Deed you hide, Wrath comes with certain, tho' with tardy Stride; Yet, yet, offended Gods, my Charmer spare! Yet pardon the first Fault of one so fair! For Gold the careful Farmer ploughs the Plain, And joins his Oxen to the cumbrous Wane; For Gold, thro' Seas that stormy Winds obey, By Stars, the Sailor steers his watery Way. Yet, gracious Gods, this Gold from Man remove, That wicked Metal brib'd the Fair I love. Soon shall you suffer greatly for your Crime, A weary Wanderer in a foreign Clime; Your Hair shall change, and boasted Bloom decay, By wintery Tempests, and the solar Ray. “Beware of Gold, how oft did I advise? “From tempting Gold what mighty Mischiefs rise? “Love's generous Power, I said, with ten-fold Pain “The Wretch will rack, who sells her Charms for Gain. “Let Torture all her Cruelties exert, “Torture is Pastime to a venal Heart. “Nor idly dream your Gallantries to hide, “The Gods are ever on the Sufferer's Side. “With Sleep or Wine o'ercome, so Fate ordains, “You'll blab the Secret of your impious Gains.” Thus oft I warn'd you; this augments my Shame; My Sighs, Tears, Homage, henceforth I disclaim. “No Wealth shall bribe my Constancy, you swore, “Be mine the Bard, you sigh'd, I crave no more: “Not all Campania shall my Heart intice, “For thee Campania's Autumns I despise. “Let Bacchus in Falernian Vineyards stray, “Not Bacchus' Vineyards shall my Faith betray.” Such strong Professions, in so soft a Strain, Might well deceive a captivated Swain; Such strong Professions might Aversion charm, Slow Doubt determine, and Indifference warm. Nay more, you wept, unpractis'd to betray, I kiss'd your Cheeks, and wip'd the Tears away. But if I tempting Gold unjustly blame, And you have left me for another Flame; May he, like you, seem kind, like you deceive, And O may you, like cheated me, believe. Oft I by Night the Torch myself would bear, That none our tender Converse might o'er-hear; When least expected, oft some Youth I led, A Youth all Beauty, to the genial Bed, And tutor'd him your Conquest to complete, By soft Enticements, and a fond Deceit. By these I foolish hop'd to gain your Love! Who than Tibullus could more cautious prove? Fir'd with uncommon Powers I swept the Lyre, And sent you melting Strains of soft Desire: The Thought o'erspreads my Face with conscious Shame, Doom, doom them Victims to the Seas or Flame. No Verse be their's, who Love's soft Fires profane, And sell inestimable Joys for Gain. But you who first the lovely Maid decoy'd, By each Adulterer be your Wife enjoy'd. And when each Youth has rifled all her Charms, May Bed-gowns guard her from your loathed Arms! May she, O may she like your Sister prove, As fam'd for drinking, far more fam'd for Love! 'Tis true, the Bottle is her chief Delight, She knows no better Way to pass the Night; Your Wife more knowing can the Night improve, To Joys of Bacchus joins the Joys of Love. Think'st thou for thee, the Toilette is her Care? For thee, that Fillets bind her well-dress'd Hair? For thee, that Tyrian Robes her Charms enfold? For thee, her Arms are deck'd with burnish'd Gold? By these, some Youth the Wanton would intice, For him she dresses, and for him she sighs; To him she prostitutes, unaw'd by Shame, Your House, your Pocket, and your injur'd Fame: Nor blame her Conduct, say, ye Young, what Charms Can Beauty taste in Gout and Age's Arms? Less nice my Fair one, she for Money can Caress a gouty impotent old Man; O thou by generous Love, too justly blam'd! All, all that Love could give, my Passion claim'd. Yet since thou couldst so mercenary prove, The more deserving shall engross my Love; Then thou wilt weep when these ador'd you see; Weep on, thy Tears will Transport give to me. To Venus I'll suspend a golden Shield, With this Inscription grav'd upon the Field. “Tibullus, freed at last from amorous Woes, “This Offering, Queen of Bliss, on thee bestows: “And humbly begs, that henceforth thou wilt guard “From such a Passion, thy devoted Bard.” THE ELEVENTH ELEGY. [Who was the first that forg'd the deadly Blade?] Who was the first that forg'd the deadly Blade? Of rugged Steel his savage Soul was made; By him, his bloody Flag Ambition wav'd; And grisly Carnage thro' the Battle rav'd: Yet wherefore blame him? we're ourselves to blame; Arms first were forg'd to kill the savage Game: Death-dealing Battles were unknown of old; Death-dealing Battles took their rise from Gold: When beachen Bowls, on oaken Tables stood, When temperate Acorns were our Fathers food; The Swain slept peaceful, with his Flocks around, No Trench was open'd, and no Fortress frown'd. O had I liv'd in gentle Days like these, To Love devoted, and to home-felt Ease; Compell'd I had not been those Arms to wear, Nor had the Trumpet forc'd me from the Fair: But now I'm dragg'd to War, perhaps my Foe E'en now prepares th'inevitable Blow! Come then, paternal Gods, whose Help I've known From Birth to Manhood, still protect your Own, Nor Blush, my Gods, tho' carv'd of antient Wood, So carv'd in our Fore-fathers Times you stood; And though in no proud Temples you were prais'd, Nor foreign Incense on your Altars blaz'd; Yet white-rob'd Faith conducted every Swain; Yet meek-ey'd Piety seren'd the Plain; While clustering Grapes, or Wheat-wreaths round your Hair, Appeas'd your Anger, and engag'd your Care: Or dulcet Cakes himself the Farmer paid, When crown'd his Wishes by your powerful Aid; While his fair Daughter, brought with her from home, The luscious Offering of a honey-Comb: If now you'll aid me in the Hour of need, Your Care I'll recompence—a Boar shall bleed. In White array'd I'll Myrtle Baskets bear, And Myrtle Foliage, round my Temples wear: In Arms redoutable let others shine, By Mars protected mow the hostile Line; You let me please, my Head with Roses crown, And every Care in flowing Goblets drown; Then when I'm joyous let the Soldier tell, What Foes were captiv'd, and what Leaders fell; Or on the Board describe with flowing Wine, The furious Onset, and the flying Line. For Reason whispers, Why will short-liv'd Man, By War contract his too contracted Span? Yet when he leaves the chearful Realms of Light, No laughing Bowls, no Harvests cheer the Sight; But howl the Damn'd, the triple Monster roars, And Charon grumbles on the Stygian Shores: By fiery Lakes, the blasted Phantoms yell, Or shrowd their Anguish in the Depths of Hell. In a thatch'd Cottage happier he by far, Who never hears of Arms, of Gold, or War, His chaste Embrace a numerous Offspring crown, He courts not Fortune's Smile, nor dreads her Frown; While lenient Baths at home his Wife prepares, He, and his Sons, attend their fleecy Cares, As old, as poor, as peaceful may I be, So guard my Flocks, and such an Offspring see. Meantime, soft Peace, descend, O! bliss our Plains! Soft Peace to plough with Oxen taught the Swains. Peace plants the Orchard, and matures the Vine, And first gay-laughing prest the ruddy Wine; The Father quaffs, deep quaff his joyous Friends, Yet to his Son a well-stor'd Vault descends. Bright shine the Plough-share, our Support and Joy! But Rust, deep Rust, the Veteran's Arms destroy! The Villager (his sacred offerings paid In the dark Grove, and consecrated Shade,) His Wife and Sons, now Darkness parts the Throng, Drives home, and whistles, as he reels along. Then triumphs Venus; then Love-feuds prevail; The Youth all jealous then the Fair assail; Doors, Windows fly, no Deference they pay, The Chastest suffer in th'ungentle Fray: These beat their Breasts, and melt in moving Tears; The Lover weeps, and blames his Rage and Fears; Love sits between, unmov'd with Tears and Sighs, And with Incentives sly the Feud supplies. Ye Youths, tho' stung with Taunts, of Blows beware; They, they are impious, who can beat the Fair: If much provok'd, or rend their silken Zone, Or on their Tresses, be your Anger shown: But if nor this your Passion can appease, Until the Charmer weep, the Charmer teaze! Blest Anger, if the Fair dissolves in Tears! Blest Youth, her Fondness undisguis'd appears! But crush the Wretch, O War, with all thy Woes, Who to rough Usage adds the Crime of Blows. Bland Peace descend, with Plenty on our Plains, And bless with Ease and laughing Sport the Swains. End of the First Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. TIBULLUS. BOOK THE SECOND. ELEGY THE FIRST. [Attend! and favour! as our Sires ordain] Attend! and favour! as our Sires ordain; The Fields we lustrate, and the rising Grain: Come, Bacchus, and thy Horns with Grapes surround; Come, Ceres, with thy wheaten Garland crown'd; This hallow'd Day suspend each Swain his Toil, Rest let the Plough, and rest th'uncultur'd Soil: Unyoke the Steer, his Racks heap high with Hay, And deck with Wreaths his honest Front To-day. Be all your Thoughts to this grand Work apply'd! And lay, ye thrifty Fair, your Wool aside! Hence I command you Mortals from the Rite, Who spent in amorous Blandishment the Night, The vernal Powers in Chastity delight. But come, ye Pure, in spotless Garbs array'd! For you the solemn Festival is made! Come! follow thrice the Victim round the Lands! In running Water purify your Hands! See! to the Flames the willing Victim come! Ye Swains with Olive crown'd, be dumb! be dumb! “From Ills, O sylvan Gods, our Limits shield, “To-day we purge the Farmer and the Field; “O let no Weeds destroy the rising Grain; “By no fell Prowler be the Lambkin slain; “So shall the Hind dread Penury no more; “But gaily smiling o'er his plenteous Store, “With liberal Hand shall larger Billets bring, “Heap the broad Hearth, and hail the genial Spring. “His numerous Bond-slaves all in goodly Rows, “With wicker Hutts your Altars shall inclose. “That done, they'll cheerly laugh, and dance, and play, “And praise your Goodness in their uncouth Lay.” The Gods assent! see! see! those Entrails show, That Heaven approves of what is done below! Now quaff Falernian, let my Chian Wine, Pour'd from the Cask in massy Goblets shine! Drink deep, my Friends; all, all, be madly gay, 'Twere Irreligion not to reel To-day! Health to Messala, every Peasant toast, And not a Letter of his Name be lost! O come, my Friend, whom Gallic Triumphs grace, Thou noblest Splendor of an antient Race; Thou whom the Arts all emulously crown, Sword of the State, and Honour of the Gown; My Theme is Gratitude, inspire my Lays! O be my Genius! while I strive to praise The rural Deities, the rural Plain, The Use of foodful Corn they taught the Swain. They taught Man first the social Hut to raise, And thatch it o'er with Turf, or leafy Sprays: They first to tame the furious Bull essay'd, And on rude Wheels the rolling Carriage laid. Man left his savage Ways; the Garden glow'd, Fruits not their own admiring Trees bestow'd, While thro' the thirsty Ground meandring Runnels flow'd. There Bees of Sweets dispoil the breathing Spring, And to their Cells the dulcet Plunder bring. The Ploughman first to sooth the toilsome Day, Chanted in measur'd Feet his sylvan Lay: And, Seed-time o'er, he first in blythsome Vein, Pip'd to his Houshold Gods the hymning Strain. Then first the Press with purple Wine o'er-ran, And cooling Water made it fit for Man. The Village-Lad first made a Wreath of Flowers To deck in Spring the tutelary Powers: Blest be the Country, yearly there the Plain Yields, when the Dog-star burns, the golden Grain: Thence too thy Chorus, Bacchus, first began, The painted Clown first laid the tragic Plan. A Goat, the Leader of the shaggy Throng, The Village sent it, recompenc'd the Song. There too the Sheep his woolly Treasure wears; There too the Swain his woolly Treasure shears; This to the thrifty Dame long Work supplies; The Distaff hence, and Basket took their Rise. Hence too the various Labours of the Loom, Thy Praise, Minerva, and Arachne's Doom! Mid Mountain Herds Love first drew vital Air, Unknown to Man, and Man had nought to fear; 'Gainst Herds, his Bow th'unskilful Archer drew; Ah my pierc'd Heart, an Archer now too true! Now Herds may roam untouch'd, 'tis Cupid's Joy, The Brave to vanquish, and to fix the Coy. The Youth whose Heart the soft Emotion feels, Nor sighs for Wealth, nor waits at Grandeur's Heels; Age fir'd by Love is touch'd by Shame no more, But blabs its Follies at the Fair One's Door! Led by soft Love, the tender trembling Fair Steals to her Swain, and cheats Suspicion's Care, With out-stretch'd Arms she wins her darkling Way, And Tiptoe listens that no Noise betray! Ah wretched those, on whom dread Cupid frowns! How happy they, whose mutual Choice he crowns! Will Love partake the Banquet of the Day? O come—but throw thy burning Shafts away. Ye Swains, begin to mighty Love the Song, Your Songs, ye Swains, to mighty Love belong! Breathe out aloud your Wishes for my Fold, Your own soft Vows in Whispers may be told. But hark! loud Mirth and Musick fire the Crowd— Ye now may venture to request aloud! Pursue your Sports; Night mounts her curtain'd Wane; The dancing Stars compose her filial Train; Black muffled Sleep steals on with silent Pace, And Dreams flit last, Imaginations Race! THE SECOND ELEGY. [Rise, happy Morn, without a Cloud arise!] Rise, happy Morn, without a Cloud arise! This Morn, Cornutus blest his Mother's Eyes! Hence each unholy Wish, each adverse Sound, As we his Altar's hallowed Verge surround! Let rich Arabian Odors scent the Skies, And sacred Incense from his Altar rise; Implor'd, thou tutelary God, descend! And deck'd with flowery Wreaths the Rites attend! Then as his Brows with precious Unguents flow, Sweet sacred Cakes, and liberal Wine bestow. O Genius, grant whate'er my Friend desires: The Cake is scatter'd, and the Flame aspires! Ask then, my noble Friend, whate'er you want: What silent still? your Prayer the God will grant: Uncovetous of rural wide Domains, You beg no woody Hills, no cultur'd Plains: Not venal, you request no Eastern Stores, Where ruddy Waters lave the gemmy Shores: Your Wish I guess; you wish a beauteous Spouse, Joy of your Joy, and faithful to your Vows. 'Tis done! my Friend! see nuptial Love appears! See! in his Hand a yellow Zone he bears! A yellow Zone, that spite of Years shall last, And heighten Fondness, even when Beauty's past. With happy Signs, great Power, confirm our Prayer, With endless Concord bless the married Pair. O grant, dread Genius, that a numerous Race Of beauteous Infants crown their fond Embrace; Their beauteous Infants round thy Feet shall play, And keep with custom'd Rites this happy Day. THE THIRD ELEGY. [My fair, Cornutus, to the Country's flown] My fair, Cornutus, to the Country's flown, Oh how insipid is the City grown! No Taste have they for Elegance refin'd; No tender Bosoms, who remain behind: Now Cytherea glads the laughing Plain, And Smiles and Sports compose her sylvan Train. Now Cupid joys to learn the Ploughman's Phrase, And clad a Peasant o'er the Fallows strays. O how the weighty Prong I'll busy weild! Should the Fair wander to the labour'd Field; A Farmer then the crooked Plough-share hold, Whilst the dull Ox prepares the vigorous Mold: I'd not complain tho' Phœbus burnt the Lands, And painful Blisters swell'd my tender Hands. Admetus' Herds the fair Apollo drove, In spite of Med'cine's Power, a Prey to Love; Nor aught avail'd to sooth his amorous Care, His Lyre of silver Sound, or waving Hair. To quench their Thirst, the Kine to Streams he led, And drove them from their Pasture to the Shed: The Milk to curdle, then, the Fair he taught, And from the Cheese to strain the dulcet Draught. Oft, oft his Virgin-sister blush'd for Shame, As bearing Lambkins o'er the Field he came! Oft would he sing the listning Vales among, Till lowing Oxen broke the plaintive Song. To Delphi, trembling anxious Chiefs repair, But got no Answer, Phœbus was not there. Thy curling Locks that charm'd a Step-dame's Eye, A jealous Step-dame, now neglected fly! To see thee, Phœbus, thus disfigur'd stray! Who could discover the fair God of Day? Constrain'd by Cupid in a Cott to pine, Where was thy Delos, where thy Pythian Shrine? Thrice happy Days, when Love almighty sway'd! And openly the Gods his Will obey'd. Now Love's soft Power's become a common Jest— Yet those, who feel his Influence in their Breast, The Prudes Contempt, the Wiseman's Sneer despise, Nor would his Chains forego, to rule the Skies. Curst Farm! that forc'd my Nemesis from Town, Blasts taint thy Vines, and Rains thy Harvests drown. Tho' Hymns implore your Aid, great God of Wine! Assist the Lover, and neglect the Vine; To Shades, unpunish'd, ne'er let Beauty stray; Not all your Vintage can its Absence pay! Rather than Harvest should the Fair detain, May Rills and Acorns feed th'unactive Swain! The Swains of old, no golden Ceres knew, And yet how fervent was their Love and true? Their melting Vows the Paphian Queen approv'd, And every Valley witness'd how they lov'd. Then lurk'd no Spies to catch the willing Maid; Doorless each House; in vain no Shepherd pray'd. Once more ye simple Usages obtain! No—lead me, drive me to the cultur'd Plain! Enchain me, whip me, if the Fair command; Whipp'd, and enchain'd, I'll plough the stubborn Land! THE FOURTH ELEGY. [Chains, and a haughty Fair I fearless view!] Chains, and a haughty Fair I fearless view! Hopes of paternal Freedom all adieu. Ah when will Love compassionate my Woes? In one sad Tenour my Existence flows: Whether I kiss or bite the galling Chain, Alike my Pleasure, and alike my Pain. I burn, I burn! oh banish my Despair! Oh ease my Torture, too too cruel Fair: Rather than feel such vast, such matchless Woe, I'd rise some Rock o'erspread with endless Snow! Or frown a Cliff on some disastrous Shore, Where Ships are wreck'd, and Tempests ever roar! In pensive Gloominess I pass the Night, Nor feel Contentment at the Dawn of Light. What though the God of Verse my Woes indite, What though I soothing Elegies can write, No Strains of Elegy her Pride controul; Gold is the Passport to her venal Soul. I ask not of the Nine the epic Lay; Ye Nine! or aid my Passion, or away. I ask not to describe in lofty Strain, The Sun's Eclipses, or the lunar Wane; To win Admission to the haughty Maid, Alone I crave your elegiac Aid; But if she still contemns the tearful Lay, Ye, and your Elegies, away, away! In vain I ask, but Gold ne'er asks in vain; Then will I desolate the World for Gain! For Gold, I'll impious plunder every Shrine; But chief, O Venus, will I plunder thine! By thee compell'd, I love a venal Maid, And quit for bloody Fields my peaceful Shade: By thee compell'd, I rob the hallowed Shrine, Then chiefly Venus will I plunder thine! Perish the Man! whose curst industrious Toil Or finds the Gem, or dies the wooly Spoil; Hence, hence the Sex's Avarice arose, And Art with Nature not enough bestows: Hence, the fierce Dog was posted for a Guard, The Fair grew venal, and their Gates were barr'd. But weighty Presents Vigilance o'ercome, The Gate bursts open, and the Dog is dumb. From venal Charms, ye Gods! what Mischiefs flow? The Joy, how much o'er-ballanc'd by the Woe! Hence, hence so few, sweet Love, frequent thy Fane, Hence impious Slander loads thy guiltless Reign. But ye! who sell your heavenly Charms for Hire, Your ill-got Riches be consum'd with Fire! May not one Lover strive to quench the Blaze, But smile malicious, as o'er all it preys! And when ye die, no gentle Friend be near, To catch your Breath, or shed a genuine Tear! Behind the Corpse, to march in solemn Show, Or Syrian Odors on the Pile bestow. Far other Fates attend the generous Maid, Tho' Age and Sickness bid her Beauties fade, Still she's rever'd; and when Death's easy Call Has freed her Spirit from Life's anxious Thrall, The pitying Neighbours all her Loss deplore, And many a weeping Friend besets the Door; While some old Lover touch'd with grateful Woe, Shall yearly Garlands on her Tomb bestow; And home returning, thus the Fair address, ‘Light may the Turf thy gentle Bosom press.’ 'Tis Truth; but what has Truth with Love to do? Imperious Cupid, I submit to you! To sell my Father's Seat should you command; Adieu my Father's Gods, my Father's Land! From madding Mares, whate'er of Poyson flows, Or on the Forehead of their Offspring grows, Whate'er Medea brew'd of baleful Juice, What noxious Herbs Æmathian Hills produce; Of all, let Nemesis a Draught compose, Or mingle Poysons, feller still than those; If she but smile, the deadly Cup I'll drain, Forget her Avarice, and exult in Pain! THE FIFTH ELEGY. [To hear our solemn Vows, O Phœbus deign!] To hear our solemn Vows, O Phœbus deign! A novel Pontiff treads thy sacred Fane: Nor distant hear, dread Power! 'tis Rome's Request, That with thy golden Lyre thou standst confest: Deign mighty Bard! to strike the vocal String, And praise thy Pontiff; we, his Praises sing: Around thy Brows, triumphant Laurels twine, Thine Altar visit, and thy Rites divine: New flush thy Charms, new curl thy waving Hair; O come the God in Vestment, and in Air! When Saturn was dethron'd, so crown'd with Bays, So rob'd, thou sungst th'Almighty Victor's Praise. What Fate, from Gods and Man, has wrapt in Night, Prophetic flashes on thy mental Sight: From Thee, Diviners learn their prescient Lore, On reeking Bowels, as they thoughtful pore: The Seer thou teachest the Success of Things, As flies the Bird, or feeds, or screams, or sings: The Sibyl-leaves if Rome ne'er sought in vain; Thou gav'st a Meaning to the mystic Strain: Thy sacred Influence may this Pontiff know, And as he reads them, with the Prophet glow. When great Æneas snatch'd his aged Sire, And burning Lares, from the Grecian Fire, She The Sibyl., she foretold this Empire fix'd by fate, And all the Triumphs of the Roman State; Yet when he saw his Ilion wrapp'd in Flame, He scarce could credit the mysterious Dame. (Quirinus had not plann'd eternal Rome, Nor had his Brother met his early Doom, Where now Jove's Temple swells, low Hamlets stood, And Domes ascend, where Heifers crop'd their Food. Sprinkled with Milk, Pan grac'd an Oak's dun Shade, And Scythe-arm'd Pales watch'd the mossy Glade; For Help from Pan, to Pan on ev'ry Bough Pipes hung, the grateful Shepherd's vocal Vow, Of Reeds, still lessening, was the Gift compos'd, And friendly Wax th'unequal Junctures clos'd. So where Velabrian Streets like Cities seem, One little Wherry plied the lazy Stream, O'er which the wealthy Shepherd's favourite Maid Was to her Swain, on Holydays, convey'd; The Swain, his Truth of Passion to declare, Or Lamb, or Cheese, presented to the Fair.) The Cumæan Sibyl speaks. “Fierce Brother of the Power of soft Desire, “Who fly'st, with Trojan Gods, the Grecian Fire! “Now Jove assigns thee Laurentine Abodes, “Those friendly Plains invite thy banish'd Gods! “There shall a nobler Troy herself applaud, “Admire her Wanderings, and the Grecian Fraud! “There, thou from yonder sacred Stream shalt rise “A God thyself, and mingle with the Skies! “No more thy Phrygians for their Country sigh, “See Conquest o'er your shatter'd Navy fly! “See the Rutulian Tents, a mighty Blaze! “Thou, Turnus! soon shalt end thy hateful Days! “The Camp I see, Lavinium greets my View! “And Alba! brave Ascanius! built by you: “I see thee, Ilia! leave the Vestal fire; “And, clasp'd by Mars, in amorous Bliss expire! “On Tyber's Bank, thy sacred Robes I see, “And Arms abandon'd, eager God! by thee. “Your Hills crop fast, ye Herds! while Fate allows; “Eternal Rome shall rise, where now ye brouze: “Rome, that shall stretch her irresistless Reign, “Wherever Ceres views her golden Grain; “Far as the East extends his purple Ray, “And where the West shuts up the Gates of Day. “The Truth I sing; so may the Laurels prove “Safe Food, and I be screen'd from guilty Love.” Thus sung the Sibyl, and address'd her Prayer, Phœbus! to thee, and madding, loos'd her Hair. Nor, Phœbus! give him only these to know, A farther Knowlege on thy Priest bestow: Let him interpret what thy fav'rite Maid, What Amalthea, what Mermessia said: Let him interpret what Albuna bore Thro' Tyber's Waves, unwet, to Tyber's farthest Shore. When stony Tempests fell, when Comets glar'd, Intestine Wars their Oracles declar'd: The sacred Groves (our Ancestors relate) Foretold the Changes of the Roman State: To charge the Clarion sounded in the Sky, Arms clash'd, Blood ran, and Warriours seem'd to die: With monstrous Prodigies the Year began: An annual Darkness the whole Globe o'er-ran; Apollo, shorn of every beamy Ray, Oft strove, but strove in vain, to light the Day: The Statues of the Gods wept tepid Tears; And speaking Oxen fill'd Mankind with Fears! These were of old: No more, Apollo! frown, But in the Waves each adverse Omen drown. O! let thy Bays in crackling Flames ascend; So shall the Year with Joy begin and end! The Bays give prosp'rous Signs; rejoice ye Swains! Propitious Ceres shall reward your Pains. With Must the jolly Rustic purpled o'er, Shall squeeze rich Clusters, which their Tribute pour, Till Vatts are wanting, to contain their Store. Far hence, ye Wolves! the mellow Shepherds bring Their Gifts to Pales, and her Praises sing. Now, fir'd with Wine, they solemn Bonfires raise, And leap, untimorous, thro' the strawy Blaze! From every Cott, unnumber'd Children throng, Frequent the Dance, and louder raise the Song: And while in Mirth the Hours they thus employ, At home the Grandsire tends his little Boy; And in each Feature pleas'd himself to trace, Foretells his Pratler will adorn the Race. The sylvan Youth, their grateful Homage paid, Where plays some Streamlet, seek th'embowering Shade; Or stretch'd on soft enamel'd Meadows lie, Where thickest Umbrage cools the Summer-sky: With Roses, see! the sacred Cup is crown'd, Hark! Music breathes her animating Sound: The Couch of Turf, and festal Tables stand Of Turf, erected by each Shepherd-hand; And all well-pleas'd, the votive Feast prepare, Each one his Goblet, and each one his Share. Now drunk, they blame their Stars and curse the Maid; But sober, deprecate whate'er they said. Perish thy Shafts, Apollo! and thy Bow! If Love unarmed in our Forests go. Yet since he learn'd to wing th'unerring Dart, Much cause has Man to curse his fatal Art: But most have I; the Sun has wheel'd his round Since first I felt the deadly festering Wound; Yet, yet I fondly, madly, wish to burn, Abjure Indifference, and at Comfort spurn; And tho' from Nemesis my Genius flows; Her scarce I sing, so weighty are my Woes! O cruel Love! how joyous should I be, Your Arrows broke, and Torch extinct to see! From you, my want of Reverence to the Skies! From you, my Woes and Imprecations rise! Yet I advise you, too relentless Fair! (As Heaven protects the Bards) a Bard to spare! E'en now, the Pontiff claims my loftiest Lay, In Triumph, soon he'll mount the sacred Way. Then pictur'd Towns shall show successful War, And Spoils and Chiefs attend his ivory Car: Myself will bear the Laurel in my Hand; And pleas'd, amid the pleas'd Spectators stand: While war-worn Veterans, with Laurels crown'd, With Io-triumphs shake the Streets around. His Father hails him, as he rides along, And entertains with pompous Shews the Throng. O Phœbus! kindly deign to grant my Prayer; So may'st thou ever wave thy curled Hair; So ever may thy Virgin-sister's Name Preserve the Lustre of a spotless Fame. THE SIXTH ELEGY. [Macer campaigns; who now will thee obey] Macer campaigns; who now will thee obey O Love! if Macer dare forego thy Sway? Put on the Crest, and grasp the burnish'd Shield, Pursue the base Deserter to the Field: Or if to Winds he gives the loosen'd Sail, Mount thou the Deck, and risk the stormy Gale: To dare desert thy sweetly-pleasing Pains, For stormy Seas, or sanguinary Plains! 'Tis, Cupid! thine, the Wanderer to reclaim, Regain thy Honour, and avenge thy Name! If such thou spar'st, a Soldier I will be, The meanest Soldier, and abandon thee. Adieu, ye trifling Loves! farewel, ye Fair! The Trumpet charms me, I to Camps repair; The martial Look, the martial Garb assume, And see the Laurel on my Forehead bloom! My vaunts how vain! debarr'd the cruel Maid, The Warriour softens, and my Laurels fade. Piqu'd to the Soul, how frequent have I swore, Her Gate so servile to approach no more? Unconscious what I did, I still return'd, Was still deny'd Access, and yet I burn'd! Ye Youths, whom Love commands with angry Sway, Attend his Wars, like me, and pleas'd obey. This Iron Age approves his Sway no more: All fly to Camps for Gold, and Gold adore: Yet Gold clothes kindred States in hostile Arms! Hence Blood and Death, Confusion and Alarms! Mankind, for Lust of Gold, at once defy The naval Combat, and the stormy Sky! The Soldier hopes, by martial Spoils, to gain Flocks without Number, and a rich Domain: His Hopes obtain'd by every horrid Crime, He seeks for Marble in each foreign Clime: A thousand Yoke sustain the pillar'd Freight, And Rome, surpriz'd beholds th'enormous Weight. Let such with Moles the furious Deep inclose, Where Fish may swim unhurt, tho' Winter blows: Let Flocks and Villas call the Spoiler Lord! And be the Spoiler by the Fair ador'd! Let one we know, a whipp'd Barbarian Slave, Live like a King, with kingly Pride behave! Be ours the Joys of œconomic Ease, From bloody Fields remote, and stormy Seas! In Gold, alas! the venal Fair delight! Since Beauty sighs for Spoil, for Spoil I'll fight! In all my Plunder Nemesis shall shine, Yours be the Profit, be the Peril mine: To deck your heav'nly Charms the Silk-worm dies, Embroidery labours, and the Shuttle flies! For you be rifled Ocean's pearly Store! To you Pactolus send his golden Ore! Ye Indians! blacken'd by the nearer Sun, Before her Steps in splendid Liveries run; For you shall wealthy Tyre and Afric vie, To yield the Purple, and the Scarlet Dye. THE SEVENTH ELEGY. [Thousands in Death would seek an End of Woe] Thousands in Death would seek an End of Woe, But Hope, deceitful Hope! prevents the Blow! Hope plants the Forest, and she sows the Plain; And feeds, with future Granaries, the Swain; Hope snares the winged Vagrants of the Sky, Hope cheats in reedy Brooks the scaly Fry; By Hope, the fetter'd Slave, the Drudge of Fate, Sings, shakes his Irons, and forgets his State; Hope promis'd you, you haughty still deny; Yield to the Goddess, O my Fair! comply. Hope whisper'd me, “Give Sorrow to the Wind! “The haughty Fair-one shall at last be kind.” Yet, yet you treat me with the same Disdain: O let not Hope's soft Whispers prove in vain! Untimely Fate your Sister snatch'd away; Spare me, O spare me, by her Shade I pray! So shall my Garlands deck her Virgin-tomb; So shall I weep, no Hypocrite, her Doom! So may her Grave with rising Flowers be drest, And the green Turf lie lightly on her Breast. Ah me! will nought avail? The World I'll fly, And, prostrate at her Tomb, a Suppliant sigh! To her attentive Ghost, of you complain; Tell my long Sorrowing, tell of your Disdain: Oft, when alive, in my Behalf she spoke: Your endless Coyness must her Shade provoke: With ugly Dreams she'll haunt your Hour of Rest, And weep before you, an unwelcome Guest! Ghastly and pale, as when besmear'd with Blood, Oh fatal Fall! she pass'd the Stygian Flood. No more, my Strains! your Eyes with Tears o'erflow, This moving Object renovates your Woe: You, you are guiltless! I your Maid accuse; You generous are! she, she has selfish Views. Nay, were you guilty, I'll no more complain; One Tear from you o'erpays a Life of Pain! She, Phryne, promis'd to promote my Vows: She took, but never gave my Billet-doux. You're gone abroad, she confidently swears, Oft when your sweet-ton'd Voice salutes mine Ears: Or, when you promise to reward my Pains, That you're afraid, or indispos'd, she feigns: Then madding Jealousy inflames my Breast; Then Fancy represents a Rival blest; I wish thee, Phryne! then, a thousand Woes;— And if the Gods with half my Wishes close, Phryne! a Wretch of Wretches thou shalt be, And vainly beg of Death to set thee free! TIBULLUS. BOOK THE THIRD. ELEGY THE FIRST. [Thy Calends, Mars! are come, from whence of old] POET. Thy Calends, Mars! are come, from whence of old, The Year's Beginning our Forefathers told: Now various Gifts thro' every House impart, The pleasing Tokens of the friendly Heart. To my Neæra, tuneful Virgins! say, What shall I give, what Honour shall I pay? Dear, e'en if fickle; dearer, if my Friend! To the lov'd Fair, what Present shall I send? MUSES. Gold wins the venal, Verse the lovely Maid: In your smooth Numbers be her Charms display'd. On polish'd Ivory let the Sheets be roll'd, Your Name in Signature, the Edges Gold. No Pumice spare to smooth each Parchment Scroll, In a gay Wrapper then secure the whole. Thus to adorn your Poems be your Care; And thus adorn'd, transmit them to the Fair. POET. Fair Maids of Pindus! I your Counsel praise: As you advise me, I'll adorn my Lays: But by your Streams, and by your Shades, I pray, Yourselves the Volume to the Fair convey. O let it lowly at her Feet be laid, Ere the gilt Wrapper, or the Edges fade; Then let her tell me, if her Flames decline, If quite extinguish'd, or if still she's mine. But first your graceful Salutations paid, In Terms submissive thus address the Maid: “Chaste Fair! the Bard, who doats upon your Charms, “And once could clasp them in his nuptial Arms, “This Volume sends; and humbly hopes, that you, “With kind Indulgence, will the Present view. “You, you! he prizes more, he vows, than Life; “Still a lov'd Sister, or again his Wife. “But oh! may Hymen bless his virtuous Fire, “And once more grant you to his fond Desire! “Fix'd in this Hope, he'll reach the dreary Shore, “Where Sense shall fail, and Memory be no more.” THE SECOND ELEGY. [Hard was the first, who ventur'd to divide] Hard was the first, who ventur'd to divide The youthful Bridegroom, and the tender Bride: More hard the Bridegroom, who can bear the Day, When Force has torn his tender Bride away. Here too my Patience, here my Manhood fails; The Brave grow Dastards, when fierce Grief assails: Die, die I must! the Truth I freely own; My Life too burthensome a Load is grown. Then, when I flit a thin an empty Shade, When on the mournful Pile my Corse is laid, With melting Grief, with Tresses loose and torn, Wilt thou, Neæra! for thy Husband mourn? A Parent's Anguish will thy Mother shew, For the lost Youth, who liv'd, who dy'd for you? But see the Flames o'er all my Body stray! And now my Shade ye call, and now ye pray In Black array'd; the Flame forgets to soar; And now pure Water on your Hands ye pour; My lov'd Remains next gather'd in a Heap, With Wine ye sprinkle, and in Milk ye steep. The Moisture dry'd, within the Urn ye lay My Bones, and to the Monument convey. Panchaian Odours thither ye will bring, And all the Produce of an Eastern Spring: But what than Eastern Springs I hold more dear, O wet my Ashes with a genuine Tear! Thus, by you both lamented, let me die, Be thus perform'd my mournful Obsequy! Then shall these Lines, by some throng'd Way, relate The dear Occasion of my dismal Fate: “Here lies poor Lygdamus; a lovely Wife, “Torn from his Arms, cut short his Thread of Life” THE THIRD ELEGY. [Why did I supplicate the Powers divine?] Why did I supplicate the Powers divine? Why votive Incense burn at every Shrine? Not that I Marble Palaces might own, To draw Spectators, and to make me known; Not that my Teams might plough new-purchas'd Plains, And bounteous Autumn glad my countless Swains: I begg'd with you my youthful Days to share, I begg'd in Age to clasp the lovely Fair; And when my stated Race of Life was o'er, I begg'd to pass alone the Stygian Shore. Can treasur'd Gold the tortur'd Breast compose? Or Plains, wide-cultur'd, sooth the Lover's Woes? Can Marble-pillar'd Domes, the Pride of Art, Secure from Sorrow the Possessor's Heart? Not circling Woods, resembling sacred Groves, Not Parian Pavements, nor gay-gilt Alcoves, Not all the Gems that load an Eastern Shore, Not whate'er else the greedy Great adore, Possess'd, can shield the Owner's Breast from Woe, Since fickle Fortune governs all below: Such Toys, in little Minds, may Envy raise; Still little Minds improper Objects praise. Poor let me be; for Poverty can please With you; without you, Crowns could give no Ease. Shine forth, bright Morn! and every Bliss impart, Restore Neæra to my doating Heart! For if her glad Return the Gods deny, If I sollicit still in vain the Sky, Nor Power, nor all the Wealth this Globe contains, Can ever mitigate my Heart-felt Pains; Let others these enjoy; be Peace my Lot, Be mine Neæra, mine a humble Cot! Saturnia, grant thy Suppliant's timid Prayer! And aid me, Venus! from thy pearly Chair! Yet, if the Sisters, who o'er Fate preside, My Vows contemning, still detain my Bride, Cease, Breast, to heave! cease, anxious Blood, to flow! Come, Death! transport me to thy Realms below. THE FOURTH ELEGY. [Last Night's ill-boding Dreams, ye Gods avert!] Last Night's ill-boding Dreams, ye Gods avert! Nor plague, with Portents, a poor Lover's Heart! But why? From Prejudice our Terrors rise; Vain Visions have no Commerce with the Skies: Th'Event of Things the Gods alone foresee, And Tuscan Priests foretel what they decree. Dreams flit at Midnight round the Lover's Head, And timorous Man alarm with idle Dread: And hence Oblations to divert the Woe, Weak stuperstitious Minds on Heaven bestow. But since whate'er the Gods foretel is true, And Man's oft warn'd, mysterious Dreams! by you; Dread Juno! make my nightly Visions vain, Vain make my boding Fears, and calm my Pain! The blessed Gods, you know, I ne'er revil'd, And nought iniquous e'er my Heart defil'd. Now Night had lav'd her Coursers in the Main, And left to dewy Dawn a doubtful Reign; Bland Sleep, that from the Couch of Sorrow flies, (The Wretch's Solace) had not clos'd my Eyes; At last, when Morn unbar'd the Gates of Light, A downy Slumber shut my labouring Sight: A Youth appear'd, with Virgin-laurel crown'd, He mov'd majestic, and I heard the Sound. Such Charms, such manly Charms, were never seen, As fir'd his Eyes, and harmoniz'd his Mein; His Hair, in Ringlets of an auburn Hue, Shed Syrian Sweets, and o'er his Shoulders flew; As white as thine, fair Luna! was his Skin, So vein'd with Azure, and as smoothly thin; So soft a Blush vermilion'd o'er his Face, As when a Maid first melts in Man's Embrace; Or when the Fair with curious Art unite The purple Amaranth, and Lilly white. A Bloom like his, when ting'd by Autumn's Pride, Reddens the Apple on the sunny Side; A Tyrian Tunic to his Ancles flow'd, Which thro' it's sirfled Plaits his godlike Beauties show'd. A Lyre, the Present Mulciber bestow'd, On his left Arm with easy Grandeur glow'd; The peerless Work of Virgin Gold was made, With Ivory, Gems, and Tortoise interlaid; O'er all the vocal Strings his Fingers stray, The vocal Strings his Fingers glad obey, And, harmoniz'd, a sprightly Prelude play: But when he join'd the Music of his Tongue, These soft, sad elegiac Lays he sung: “All hail, thou Care of Heaven! (a virtuous Bard “The God of Wine, the Muses, I, regard;) “But neither Bacchus, nor the Thespian Nine, “The sacred Will of Destiny divine: “The secret Book of Destiny to see, “Heaven's awful Sire has given alone to me; “And I, unerring God, to you explain “(Attend and credit) what the Fates ordain. “She who is still your ever constant Care, “Dearer to you than Sons to Mothers are, “Whose Beauties bloom in every softned Line, “Her Sex's Envy, and the Love of thine: “Not with more Warmth is female Fondness mov'd, “Not with more Warmth are tenderest Brides belov'd. “For whom you hourly importune the Sky, “For whom you wish to live, nor fear to die, “Whose Form, when Night has wrap'd in Black the Pole, “Cheats in soft Vision your enamour'd Soul; “Neæra! whose bright Charms your Verse displays, “Seeks a new Lover, and inconstant strays! “For thee no more with mutual Warmth she burns, “But thy chaste House, and chaste Embrace, she spurns. “O cruel, perjur'd, false, intriguing Sex! “O born with Woes poor wretched Man to vex! “Whoe'er has learn'd her Lover to betray, “Her Beauty perish, and her Name decay! “Yet, as the Sex will change, avoid Despair; “A patient Homage may subdue the Fair. “Fierce Love taught Man to suffer, laugh at Pain; “Fierce Love taught Man, with Joy, to drag the Chain; “Fierce Love, nor vainly fabulous the Tale, “Forc'd me, yes forc'd me, to the lonely Dale: “There I Admetus' snowy Heifers drove, “Nor tun'd my Lyre, nor sung, absorb'd in Love “The favourite Son of Heaven's almighty Sire, “Prefer'd a Straw-pipe to his golden Lyre. “Tho' false the Fair, tho' Love is wild, obey; “Or, Youth, you know not Love's tyrannic Sway. “In plaintive Strains address the haughty Fair; “The Haughty soften at the Voice of Prayer. “If ever true my Delphian Answers prove, “Bear this my Message to the Maid you love. “Pride of your Sex, and Passion of the Age! “No more let other Men your Love engage; “A Bard on you the Delian God bestows, “This Match alone can warrant your Repose.” He sung. When Morpheus from my Pillow flew, And plung'd me in substantial Griefs anew. Ah! who could think that thou had'st broke thy Vows, That thou, Neæra! sought'st another Spouse? Such horrid Crimes, as all Mankind detest, Could they, how could they, harbour in thy Breast? The ruthless Deep, I know, was not thy Sire; Nor fierce Chimæra, belching Floods of Fire; Nor did'st thou from the triple Monster spring, Round whom a Coil of kindred Serpents cling; Thou art not of the Lybian Lions' Seed, Of barking Scylla's, nor Charybdis' Breed; Nor Afric's Sands, nor Scythia gave thee Birth; But a compassionate, benignant Earth. No! thou, my Fair! deriv'st thy noble Race From Parents deck'd with every human Grace. Ye Gods! avert the Woes that haunt my Mind, And give the cruel Phantoms to the Wind. THE FIFTH ELEGY. [While you at Tuscan Baths for Pleasure stay] While you at Tuscan Baths for Pleasure stay, (Too hot when Sirius darts his sultry Ray, Tho' now that purple Spring adorns the Trees, Not Baia's more medicinal than these,) Me harder Fates attend, my Youth decays; Yet spare, Persephone! my blameless Days: With secret Wickedness unstung my Soul; I never mix'd, nor gave the baneful Bowl; I ne'er the holy Mysteries proclaim'd; I fir'd no Temple, and no God defam'd; Age has not snow'd my jetty Locks with White, Nor bent my Body, nor decay'd my Sight; (When both the Consuls fell, ah fatal Morn! Fatal to Roman Freedom! I was born.) Apples unripe, what Folly 'tis to pull, Or crush the Cluster ere the Grapes are full! Ye gloomy Gods! whom Acheron obeys, Dispel my Sickness, and prolong my Days! Ere to the Shades my dreary Steps I take, Or ferry o'er th'irremeable Lake, Let me (with Age when wrinkled all my Face) Tell ancient Stories to my listening Race; Thrice five long Days and Nights consum'd with Fire, (O sooth its Rage!) I gradually expire; While you the Naiad of your Fountain praise, Or lave, or spend in gentle Sport your Days: Yet, O my Friends! whate'er the Fates decree, Joy guide your Steps, and still remember me! Mean Time, to deprecate the fierce Disease, And hasten glad Returns of vigorous Ease, Milk, mix'd with Wine, O promise to bestow, And sable Victims, on the Gods below. THE SIXTH ELEGY. [Come, Bacchus, come! so may the mystic Vine] LOVER. Come, Bacchus, come! so may the mystic Vine And verdant Ivy round thy Temples twine! My Pains, the Anguish I endure, remove; Oft hast thou vanquish'd the fierce Pangs of Love. Haste, Boy, with old Falernian crown the Bowl, In the gay Cordial let me drench my Soul. Hence, gloomy Care! I give you to the Wind; The God of Fancy frolicks in my Mind! My dear Companions! favour my Design, Let's drown our Senses all, in rosy Wine! COMPANION. Those may the Fair with practis'd Guile abuse, Who, sourly wise, the gay Dispute refuse: The jolly God can Cheerfulness impart, Enlarge the Soul, and pour out all the Heart. LOVER. But Love the Monsters of the Wood can tame, The wildest Tygers own the powerful Flame: He bends the stubborn to his awful Sway, And melts Insensibility away: So wide the Reign of Love! COMPANION. Wine, Wine, dear Boy! Can any here in empty Goblets joy? No, no! the God can never disapprove, That those who praise him, should a Bumper love. What Terrors arm his Brow? the Goblet drain: To be too sober, is to be profane! Her Son, who mock'd his Rites, Agave tore, And furious scatter'd round the yelling Shore! Such Fears be far from us, dread God of Wine! Thy Rites we honour, we are wholly thine! But let the sober Wretch thy Vengeance prove: LOVER. Or her, whom all my Sufferings cannot move! —What pray'd I rashly for? my madding Prayer, Ye Winds! disperse, unratified, in Air: For tho', my Love! I'm blotted from your Soul, Serenely rise your Days, serenely roll! COMPANION. The Love-sick Struggle past, again be gay: Come, crown'd with Roses, let's drink down the Day! LOVER. Ah me! loud-laughing Mirth how hard to feign! When doom'd a Victim to Love's dreadful Pain: How forc'd the drunken Catch, the smiling Jest, When black Sollicitude annoys the Breast! COMPANION. Complaints, away! the blythsome God of Wine Abhors to hear his genuine Votaries whine. LOVER. You, Ariadne! on a Coast unknown, The perjur'd Theseus wept, and wept alone; But learn'd Catullus, in immortal Strains, Has sung his Baseness, and has wept your Pains. COMPANION. Thrice happy they, who hear Experience call, And shun the Precipice where others fall. When the Fair clasps you to her Breast, beware, Nor trust her, by her Eyes altho' she swear; Not tho', to drive Suspicion from your Breast, Or Love's soft Queen, or Juno she attest; No Truth the Women know; their Looks are Lies. LOVER. Yet Jove connives at amorous Perjuries. Hence, serious Thoughts! then why do I complain? The Fair are licenc'd by the Gods to feign. Yet would the Guardian Powers of gentle Love, This once indulgent to my Wishes prove, Each Day we then should laugh, and talk, and toy, And pass each Night in hymeneal Joy. O let my Passion six thy faithless Heart! For still I love thee, faithless as thou art! Bacchus the Naiad loves; then haste, my Boy! My Wine to temper cooler Streams employ. What tho' the smiling Board Neæra flies, And in a Rival's Arms perfidious lies, The live-long Night, all sleepless, must I whine? Not I— COMPANION. Quick, Servants! bring us stronger Wine. LOVER. Now Syrian Odours scent the festal Room, Let rosy Garlands on our Foreheads bloom. THE SEVENTH ELEGY. [To you my Tongue eternal Fealty swore] I To you my Tongue eternal Fealty swore, My Lips the Deed with conscious Rapture own; A fickle Libertine I rove no more, You only please, and lovely seem alone. II The numerous Beauties that gay Rome can boast, With you compar'd, are Ugliness at best; On me their Bloom and practis'd Smiles are lost, Drive then, my Fair! Suspicion from your Breast. III Ah no! Suspicion is the Test of Love: I too dread Rivals, I'm suspicious grown; Your Charms the most insensate Heart must move; Would you were beauteous in my Eyes alone! IV I want not Man to envy my sweet Fate, I little care that others think me blest; Of happy Conquests let the Coxcomb prate; Vainglorious Vaunts the silent Wise detest. V Supremely pleas'd with you, my heavenly Fair! In any trackless Desert I could dwell; From our Recess your Smiles would banish Care, Your Eyes give Lustre to the Midnight Cell. VI For various Converse I should long no more, The blythe, the moral, witty, and severe; Its various Arts are her's, whom I adore; She can depress, exalt, instruct, and cheer. VII Should mighty Jove send down from Heaven a Maid, With Venus' Cestus zon'd, my Faith to try, (So, as I Truth declare, me Juno aid!) For you I'd scorn the Charmer of the Sky. VIII But hold! you're mad to vow, unthinking Fool! Her boundless Sway you're mad to let her know: Safe from Alarms, she'll treat you as a Tool— Ah, babbling Tongue! from thee what Mischiefs flow! IX Yet let her use me with Neglect, Disdain; In all, subservient to her Will I'll prove; Whate'er I feel, her Slave I'll still remain, Who shrinks from Sorrow, cannot be in Love! X Imperial Queen of Bliss! with Fetters bound, I'll sit me down before your holy Fane; You kindly heal the constant Lover's Wound, Th'inconstant torture with Increase of Pain. SULPICIA's POEMS. POEM THE FIRST. [Great God of War! Sulpicia, lovely Maid] Great God of War! Sulpicia, lovely Maid, To grace your Calends, is in Pomp array'd. If Beauty warms you, quit th'ethereal Height, E'en Cytherea will indulge the Sight: But while you gaze o'er all her matchless Charms, Beware your Hands should meanly drop your Arms! When Cupid would the Gods with Love surprize, He lights his Torches at her radiant Eyes. A secret Grace her every Act improves, And pleasing follows wheresoe'er she moves: If loose her Hair upon her Bosom plays, Unnumber'd Charms that Negligence betrays: Or if 'tis plaited with a labour'd Care, Alike the labour'd Plaits become the Fair. Whether rich Tyrian Robes her Charms invest, Or all in snowy White the Nymph is drest, All, all she graces, still supremely fair, Still charms Spectators with a fond Despair. A thousand Dresses thus Vertumnus wears, And beauteous equally in each appears. The richest Tints and deepest Tyrian Hue, To thee, O wonderous Maid! are solely due: To thee th'Arabian Husbandman should bring The spicy Produce of his eastern Spring: Whatever Gems the swarthy Indians boast, Their shelly Treasures, and their golden Coast, Alone thou merit'st! Come, ye tuneful Choir! And come, bright Phœbus! with thy plausive Lyre! This solemn Festival harmonious praise, No Theme so much deserves harmonious Lays. THE SECOND POEM. [Whether, fierce churning Boars! in Meads ye stray] Whether, fierce churning Boars! in Meads ye stray, Or haunt the shady Mountain's devious Way; Whet not your Tusks, my lov'd Cerinthus spare! Know, Cupid! I consign him to your Care. What Madness 'tis, shagg'd tractless Wilds to beat, And wound, with pointed Thorns, your tender Feet: O! why to savage Beasts your Charms oppose? With Toils and Blood-hounds why their Haunts inclose? The Lust of Game decoys you far away; Ye Blood-hounds perish, and ye Toils decay! Yet, yet could I with lov'd Cerinthus rove Thro' dreary Desarts, and the thorny Grove: The cumbrous Meshes on my Shoulders bear, And face the Monsters with my barbed Spear: Could track the bounding Stags thro' tainted Grounds, Beat up their Cover, and unchain the Hounds: But most to spread our artful Toils I'd joy, For while we watch'd them, I could clasp the Boy! Then, as entranc'd in amorous Bliss we lay, Mix'd Soul with Soul, and melted all away! Snar'd in our Nets, the Boar might safe retire, And owe his Safety to our mutual Fire. O! without me ne'er taste the Joys of Love, But a chaste Hunter in my Absence prove. And O! may Boars the wanton Fair destroy, Who would Cerinthus to their Arms decoy! Yet, yet I dread!—Be Sports your Father's Care; But you, all Passion! to my Arms repair! THE THIRD POEM. [Come, Phœbus! with your loosely floating Hair] Come, Phœbus! with your loosely floating Hair, O sooth her Torture, and restore the Fair! Come, quickly come! we supplicant implore, Such Charms your happy Skill ne'er sav'd before! Let not her Frame, consumptive pine away, Her Eyes grow languid, and her Bloom decay; Propitious come! and with you bring along Each pain-subduing Herb, and soothing Song; Or real Ills, or whate'er Ills we fear, To Ocean's farthest Verge let Torrents bear. O! rack no more, with harsh, unkind Delays, The Youth, who ceaseless for her Safety prays; 'Twixt Love and Rage his tortur'd Soul is torn; And now he prays, now treats the Gods with Scorn. Take Heart, fond Youth! you have not vainly pray'd, Still persevere to love th'inchanting Maid: Sulpicia is your own! for you she sighs, And slights all other Conquests of her Eyes: Dry then your Tears; your Tears would fitly flow Did she on others her Esteem bestow. O come! what Honour will be yours, to save At once two Lovers from the doleful Grave? Then both will emulous exalt your Skill; With grateful Tablets, both your Temples fill; Both heap with spicy Gums your sacred Fire; Both sing your Praises to th'harmonious Lyre: Your Brother-Gods will prize your healing Powers, Lament their Attributes, and envy yours. THE FOURTH POEM. [On my Account, to Grief a ceaseless Prey] On my Account, to Grief a ceaseless Prey, Dost thou a sympathetic Anguish prove? I would not wish to live another Day, If my Recovery did not charm my Love: For what were Life, and Health, and Bloom to me, Were they displeasing, beauteous Youth! to thee. THE FIFTH POEM. [With Feasts I'll ever grace the sacred Morn] With Feasts I'll ever grace the sacred Morn, When my Cerinthus, lovely Youth! was born. At Birth, to you th'unerring Sisters sung Unbounded Empire o'er the Gay and Young: But I, chief I! (if you my Love repay,) With Rapture own your ever-pleasing Sway. This I conjure you, by your charming Eyes, Where Love's soft God in wanton Ambush lies! This by your Genius, and the Joys we stole, Whose sweet Remembrance still enchants my Soul! Great natal Genius! grant my Heart's Desire, So shall I heap with costly Gums your Fire! Whenever Fancy paints me to the Boy, Let his Breast pant with an impatient Joy: But if the Libertine for others sigh (Which Love forbid!) O Love! your Aid deny. Nor, Love! be partial, let us both confess The pleasing Pain, or make my Passion less. But O! much rather 'tis my Soul's Desire, That both may feel an equal, endless Fire. In secret my Cerinthus begs the same, But the Youth blushes to confess his Flame: Assent, thou God! to whom his Heart is known, Whether he public ask, or secret own. THE SIXTH POEM. [Accept, O natal Queen! with placent Air] Accept, O natal Queen! with placent Air, The Incense offer'd by the learned Fair. She's rob'd in cheerful Pomp, O Power divine! She's rob'd to decorate your Matron-shrine; Such her Pretence; but well her Lover knows Whence her gay Look, and whence her Finery flows. Thou, who dost o'er the nuptial Bed preside, O! let not envious Night their Joys divide, But make the Bridegroom amorous as the Bride! So shall they tally, matchless lovely Pair! A Youth all Transport, and a melting Fair! Then let no Spies their secret Haunts explore; Teach them thy Wiles, O Love! and guard the Door. Assent, chaste Queen! in purple Pomp appear; Thrice Wine is pour'd, and Cakes await you, here. Her Mother tells her for what Boon to pray; Her Heart denies it, tho' her Lips obey. She burns, that Altar as the Flames devour; She burns, and slights the Safety in her Power. So may the Boy, whose Chains you proudly wear, Thro' Youth the soft indulgent Anguish bear; And when old Age has chill'd his every Vein, The dear Remembrance may he still retain! THE SEVENTH POEM. [At last the natal odious Morn draws nigh] I At last the natal odious Morn draws nigh, When to your cold, cold Villa I must go; There, far, too far from my Cerinthus Sigh: Oh why, Messala! will you plague me so? II Let studious Mortals prize the sylvan Scene; And ancient Maidens hide them in the Shade; Green Trees perpetually give me the Spleen; For Crowds, for Joy, for Rome, Sulpicia's made! III Your too officious Kindness gives me Pain. How fall the Hail-stones! hark! how howls the Wind! Then know, to grace your Birth-day should I deign, My Soul, my All, I leave at Rome behind. THE EIGHTH POEM. [At last the Fair's determin'd not to go] At last the Fair's determin'd not to go: My Lord! you know the Whimsies of the Sex. Then let us gay carouze, let Odours flow; Your Mind no longer with her Absence vex: For oh! consider, Time incessant flies; But every Day's a Birth-day to the Wise! THE NINTH POEM. [That I, descended of Patrician Race] That I, descended of Patrician Race, With Charms of Fortune, and with Charms of Face, Am so indifferent grown to you of late, So little car'd for, now excites no Hate. Rare Taste, and worthy of a Poet's Brain, To prey on Garbage, and a Slave adore! In such to find out Charms, a Bard must feign Beyond what Fiction ever feign'd of Yore. Her Friends may think Sulpicia is disgrac'd; No! no! she honours your transcendent Taste. THE TENTH POEM. [If from the Bottom of my love-sick Heart] If from the Bottom of my love-sick Heart, Of last Night's Coyness I do not repent, May I no more your tender Anguish hear, No longer see you shed th'impassion'd Tear. You grasp'd my Knees, and yet to let you part— O Night more happy with Cerinthus spent! My Flame with Coyness to conceal I thought, But this Concealment was too dearly bought. THE ELEVENTH POEM. [Fame says, my Mistress loves another Swain] Fame says, my Mistress loves another Swain; Would I were deaf, when Fame repeats the Wrong! All Crimes to her imputed, give me Pain, Not change my Love: Fame, stop your sawcy Tongue! THE TWELFTH POEM. [Let other Maids, whose Eyes less prosperous prove] Let other Maids, whose Eyes less prosperous prove, Publish my Weakness, and condemn my Love. Exult, my Heart! at last the Queen of Joy, Won by the Music of her Votary's Strain, Leads to the Couch of Bliss herself the Boy; And bids Enjoyment thrill in every Vein: Last Night entranc'd in Extacy we lay, And chid the quick, too quick Return of Day! But stop, my Hand! beware what loose you scrawl, Lest into curious Hands the Billet fall. No—the Remembrance charms!—begone, Grimace! Matrons! be yours Formality of Face. Know, with a Youth of Worth, the Night I spent, And cannot, cannot, for my Soul repent! THE END.</field>
