      <field name="fulltext">THE BLACK BASTEL. The thousand yeare, six hundred &amp; eleven, When as the Sun entred in Sagittarie, Orion rising in the east of heaven, Diana's court then Gemini did carie, And Ioue in the Meridian did tarie, Saturne severely rolling o're the night, Mars, Venus, Hermes bringing home the light. The aire was cold, but calme, no cloud in sky, The fields all white, and the great Ocean still; Yet the hard frost making the ground as dry, I quickly stir'd my selfe to walk at will Along the shore; at length I came untill A braue white place, where had ben built a castel, And commonly is called, the Black Bastell. I took me to a caue where was some hay, The mouth whereof lay open to the Sun, There did I rest me warme, as into May: And after some deep meditation, I slept, and thought I saw a vision, A sight which griev'd me at the heart right sore, And unto death will ever more and more. A woman of most comely countenance, With farded face, and garish in attire, A crown of glasse upon her head did glance, Her clothes were colour'd contrare her desire, A heavie yoke upon her neck and lyre, Of Reed a scepter in her hand she boore, Rich in attire, yet silly, leane, and poore. Rais'd up on high upon a royall Throne, Did awfull sit aboue the womans head, Commanding everie thing for to be done, As pleased him, a rampand Lyon red: This Lyon craftie Foxes two did lead, Now 14.And round about him thirteen wolues did dance To keep her sheep, whom he was to advance. Her sheepheards all in hundreds stood near by, With dog &amp; staffe, who somtime bold had been, But now were carelesse, though they heard her cry, And used just like to a captiue Queen; Her heavie case some few in heart did meen, But could not helpe, so many couch'd for feare Of Wolfe and Lyon, or were snar'd with geare. Her Torches, Tapers, Candles were put out, And none there was that durst renew their light: Great flocks of sheep lay folded round about, Well pluck'd and clipped bare into my sight, If once on them she cast her eyes full bright, The Wolues to yell, the Lyon fell to roare, Which did affright that Ladies heart full sore. Vpon a table spred with cloth of green, Did lye two bookes, all over-gilt, but closed, That not one word within them might be seen: For mens conceits were then to be imposed, And that no good occasion might bee losed, Me thought assembly summon'd was &amp; called, Glasgow assembly 1610. Of huble buble sheepheards hir'd and thralled. Apes, horses, hounds met there, with many a tod, The Leopard with aromatick smell, Dunbar. As Lyons great Lieutenant with his nod, And mangled speech, the Lyons will could tell, Fenced the court, threatned if any mell With matters there, but as he had directed, That they should rue, &amp; soundly be corrected. Then stood there up a Wolfe all clad in silk, Spotswear A Wolfe indeed, yet lisping like a Lambe, And made a sermon all of wooll and milk, To move the sheepheards hired for the same, Consent the Lyon there should win the game. Causing all beasts and sheep for to beleeue, Nought could be done without the lyons leaue. And then forsooth the Wolfs must be advanced, Seeing it was the Lyons will and pleasure: To sheep no greater curse there could haue chanced. Yet did the Lyon like them out of measure, His royall crowne, his dignitie and treasure, Without such statesmen could not stable stand, Nor could he freely reigne within the land. With one consent the beasts about applauded, None of the sheepheards there would c?tradict, For hirelings rents the Lyon was collauded, No limitation, threatning was so thick: Some for to say intended sick and sick, But fear and geare, and falshood all convoyed, And so the Lyon what he would enjoyed. The dogs shal have their wonted cotes in cure, The wolfs aboue the dogs high shal be placed, To make the Lyons crown stand firm and sure. This being done, &amp; wolfs thus greatly graced, Reel'd to and fro till they had all defaced. The wofull woman in her bitter passion, Powr'd out with tears this heavie lamentation. I was of late a Queen of great renowne, My fame was spred abroad all Europe through, In everie province, and in everie towne, I was well served both in land and Burgh. No person high or low, so rude, so rough, My lawes or precepts rashly vilipended. All stood such aw that I should be offended. Through all the land my congregations For to behold it was an heavenly sight, The like whereof was not in other nations, Such lively force, and such a lampe of light, Such evidence of all spirituall might, By divine doctrine throwing down the proud, And feeding hungry souls with healthfull food, A thunderbolt from pulpit, as from heaven, You should have heard a fearful noise to make, By force whereof a hard heart rent and riven, The stubburn sinners stallward stomake quake, The members tremble, and the head to ake, With such a shout when doctrine was applied, As would have made the stoutest courage flied. Thus knocked first my Knox, and terrified The Zinzummins, and all the hounds of hell, My Lowson, Craig, and Durie magnified That message which did scarre all fiendes fell, My Bruce, my Rollock with a heavenly smell Of fervent zeale and true sanctification, Perfum'd the hearts of many in that nation. My Presbytries had such a comely order, That all light Levits, and the lewdest limmer, Either in Hieland, or the utmost border, Did them regard- yet was it not farre trimmer, When Synods met in winter and in summer? Try'd Presbytries, and if peradventure, Ought was amisse, redrest it by their censure. My generall assemblies terrible, Like to an armie with displayed Banners Control'd all were incorrigible In lower Synods for their vitious manners With care suppressed all corrupt explainers Of Scriptures; Papists and all heretickes Were curbed, and contending Schismatickes. With wine &amp; honey did my Schools ore-flow, When Melvil and his fellows had the charge, Then did the youth in zeal and learning grow, From thence I had Barjona and Boanerge, When shepheards stip?ds were not half so large, Such were prefer'd as rightly were affected, But Dogs &amp; Swine, if known, were all rejected. That lownes are now made Lords my heart it galls, Worthies exiled, &amp; the worst rewarded, To see false knaves to governe, sore me thralls, The grave and godly not to be regarded: I mocked am while they me thus have farded, My gold in glasse, my searge is turn'd in scarlet, Not like my selfe, but like to Babels harlot. My crown and solid scepter they haue rest me, And drest me up in bruckle glasse and reed, And rest the rights wherwith my king infest me Without the which my flock I cannot feed As it becometh, with that heavenly bread. They haue upon me laid this heavie yoke Of bite-sheep Bishops, as I were a stocke. This st?bling-block hath made fro heaven to tumble Some seeming stars, &amp; made th? change their tongue, My weakling hogs &amp; lambs are made to st?ble, Pastors to hear from point to point impugne, That which before as truth from pulpits rung, Are so offended, that in their hearts they mum, Cast so in doubt, they know not where to turn. Never was nation so solemnly sworne, Vnder the pain of fearfull condemnation, To discipline defend, which now with scorn, Is tramped under foot with fierce oppression. For perfidie, and for such foul defection, I am so stonisht that I cannot stand For horrour, but do tremble foot and hand. Prayer and preaching are they not prophan'd, And hireling pastors love to live at ease, Sinceritie and zeale all where disdain'd, Who is not luke-warm nick-nam'd is precise, Or not conform unto the Kirks decrees. Say libertines, althogh their cause be wrongous, The rod is rent wherwith before they dang us. O that my people their apostasie Would yet perceive, &amp; seek to God their guide, Would yet confesse their vile hypocrisie, Foresee at last what shall at length betide, Flourish shall poperie in its greatest pride. This is but doubt the foretold day of tryall: Lord save thine own from filthy soule denyall. Consider, Lord, with pittie, my complaint, My glore is gone, I mourn for Elies fall, And captive ark, I wish my life were spent. Gone are the great assemblies generall, And few, or none, for their return do call. The holy vessels are carri'd far away, Wolfe, hogge and dogge do what they please or may. Me to comfort there is none of my lovers, My friends are fled, and look to me a farre; Yea many of them are become reprovers, They turn aside, and glance on me a skarre, And some, like barking dogs, begin to gnarre, By craft, by coin, by Kings authoritie, What pleases men, is brought to passe on me. I cry as if I felt some sharp incision, When I beholde the present miserie, I cry as if there were some great division Into my bones, with pain to torment me. Wilde Boars and swine dwell in the sanctuarie, Even bastard Bishops, worse than Moabites, And more malicious than the Ammonites. Like subtile foxes they have entred in, Pretending me to honour and enrich, Wild wolfs well wrapped in a weathers skin, Have dealt by craft till I fell in the ditch: Now on my belly they their tents do pitch, And reign like lyons o're my sheepe and hogs. Convert them Lord, or let them die like dogs. My candlestick is like to be removed For sins of Pastors and of Congregations, Which thee, ô Lord, have unto wrath c?moved; And have brought on these fearfull desolations, Pastors for gain and glore have left their stations. Their wealth and honour is not worth a louse, If Christ with grace be banisht from the house. Are these the fruits, O Scotland, of thy field? Are these the grapes of such a glorious vine? Are these the captains cast away their shields? Are these the souldiers vowd their lives to tine? I am ashamed that they are call'd mine. They feeble are, I cannot say bewitched, That thus do faint &amp; flee, when scarsly touched. It is well seen the dastard spirit of slaverie Hath made thee for to quite thy libertie, It is well seen the craftie spirit of knaverie Hath spoyld thee of thy magnanimitie, And brought thee under this servilitie. No Kirk so glorious was in any land, But now it seemes it builded was on sand. Wilt thou return to beastly Babylon? Wilt thou returne againe to Egypt land? Wilt thou forsake thy holy mount Sion? And joyne thy self unto that cursed band? Shall Antichrist thus have the upper hand, And all my fairhfull servants never see Returne againe their late captivitie? Then wish I Lord, that thou shouldst make my head A running well, whose waters ever grow, Or that mine eyes were zetting spouts of lead, Wherout my gushing tears may ever flow; Yea some great floud, where barges great may row That aye the earth may drink my tears as raine, And aye my eyes may make it moist againe. O that I had the wings of some faire Doue, That I might flee forth to the wildernesse, Lest I should seem their doings to approue, Or beare with such professed wickednesse; But since (alas) I can it not redresse, I will go hence, and hide me in some hill, Or in some hole where I may weep my fill. Nor will I cease from sighs, O Lord, each day, Till of my pains thou have compassion, And do repaire the breach and great decay Of Sion, and her desolation, And to my mourners send some consolation: For I cannot permit an earthly King, Or paughtie Prelates o're my head to reigne. CONCLVSION. Now certainly I thoght she would have spended Moe dayes and nights into her lamentation, If thar a fierie dragon had not ended Her mournfull moan in a most ugly fashion, With horrible and fearfull perturbation, He spouted flames, and troubled all the aire, That she noght spake, and I could hear na mair. But suddenly down with a mightie hoast Come Michael with all his Angels cleare. And beat him down for all his fearfull boast, And carried thence with him his Ladie deare. Sure I was put into a fellon feare, I found me faint, come home, and yet the vision Made in my minde and heart a deep impression. ANOTHER DEPLORING of late the case of our Kirk. No pleasure of my pleasures all, can pleasant be to mee, O dearest mother chast, and all for shame and skaith of thee. Mine eyes powre out salt streames of teares, thy thraldome to deplore, Mine heart doth bleed, my lungs doe leap, and all my bowels roare, My Diademe of gold and gemmes, which did thy head adorne, Is thrown to ground, in place whereof thou crowned art with thorne. Thy costly chaines bestow'd on thee, by thy deare Spouse and Lord, Are quite bereft, and thy faire neck now compast with a cord. Thy royall robe embroidered faire, and lined with Lucerve, Is turn'd to sacke, which to beholde doth make my flesh to sterve. Thy bracelets rich, which did of lare decore thy comely hands, Are rent from them, and fettered fast into hard yron bands. Thy golden rod chang'd in a reed, by humane art compiled, Thine holy Seales with papall stampe, and Romish rites defiled. Where faithfull preachers with Christs voyce, were wont to sound before, Now bite-sheepe wolves into thine eares with uncouth howlings roare. Arminianisme and Papistrie, now in thy pulpits sound, Which like a daggers deadly dint, doth cause my stomacke stound. I and my mates sometime refresht with dew from heaven that rained, Now poysoned are with these fowle dregges, from Romish Bitch are strained. Prince, People, Peeres, and Prelates all, awake, awake in time, With teares, and sighes, and sobbes striue still to expiate this crime. Mr. ANDREW MELVINS Epigramme upon the English Altar in Latine, and translated. On Kingly Chappels altar stand, blinde candlestickes, clos'd bookes, Dry silver basins, two of each. Wherefore? saith he who looks, The minde and worship of the Lord Doth England so keep close Blinde in her sight, and buried in her filthinesse and drosse. And while with Romane rites she doth Her kingly altar dresse, Religiously the purpled whoore, to trim she doth professe. FINIS.</field>
