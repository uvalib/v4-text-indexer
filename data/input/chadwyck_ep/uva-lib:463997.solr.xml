Wiþ tomas spak y þare; Þer herd y rede in roune Who tristrem gat and bare, Who was king wiþ croun, And who him forsterd ?are, And who was bold baroun, As þair elders ware. Bi ?ere Tomas telles in toun Þis auentours as þai ware. Þis semly somers day, In winter it is nou?t sen; Þis greues wexen al gray, Þat in her time were grene. So dos þis world, y say, Y wis and nou?t at wene, Þe gode ben al oway Þat our elders haue bene. (To abide) Of akni?t is þat y mene, His name, it sprong wel wide. Wald morgan þole no wrong, Þei morgan lord wes; He brak his castels strong, His bold borwes he ches, His men he slou? among And reped him mani ares. Þe wer lasted so long Til morgan asked pes Þurch pine. For soþe wiþ outen les, His liif he wende to tine. Pus þe batayl, it bigan (Witeþ wele it was so) Bitvene þe douk morgan And rouland þat was þro, Þat neuer þai no lan Þe pouer to wirche wo. Þai spilden mani aman Bitven hem seluen to In prise: Þat on was douk morgan, Þat oþer rouland rise. Þe kni?tes þat were wise, A forward fast þai bond Þat ich aman schul ioien his And seuen ?er to stond; Þe douke and rouland riis Þer to þai bed her hond To hei?e and holden priis, And foren till inglond To lende; Markes king þai fond Wiþ kni?tes mani and hende. To marke þe king þai went Wiþ kni?tes proude in pres And teld him to þende His auentours as it wes. He preyd hem as his frende To duelle wiþ him in pes. Þe kni?tes, þai were hende And dede wiþ outen les In lede: A turnament þai ches Wiþ kni?tes stiþe on stede. Glad aman was he, Þe turnament dede crie Þat maidens mi?t him se And ouer þe walles to lye. Þai asked who was fre To win þe maistrie, Þai seyd þat best was he, Þe child of ermonie, In tour. For þi chosen was he To maiden blaunche flour. Þe maiden of hei?e kinne Sche cald hir maisters þre:— Bot ?iue it be þurch ginne, A selly man is he; Þurch min hert wiþ inne Ywounded haþ he me So sone: Of bale bot he me blinne, Mine liif days ben al done.” He was gode and hende, Stalworþ, wise and wi?t; In to þis londes ende Y not non better kni?t, Trewer non to frende, And rouland riis he hi?t. To batayl gan he wende, Was wounded in þat fi?t Ful felle. Blauncheflour þe bri?t, Þe tale þan herd sche telle. Sche seyd:—“wayleway!” When hye herd it was so; To hir maistresse sche gan say Þat hye was boun to go To þe kni?t þer he lay. Sche swouned and hir was wo, So comfort he þat may, A knaue child gat þai tvo, So dere; And seþþen men cleped him so:— Tristrem þe trewe fere. Þe trewes þat þai hadde tan And stabled in her þou?t Þan brak þe douk morgan, He no wald held it nou?t. Rohand, trewe so stan, A letter he þer wrou?t And sent to rouland o nan, As man of socour sou?t In kare To help what he mou?t, Or lesen al þat þer ware. Rouland riis in tene Tok leue at markes king Or þou wilt wende wiþ me.” “Mi duelling is hir ille, Bihold and tow may se. Mi rede is taken þer tille, Þat fare y wille wiþ þe And finde Þi fair folk and þi fre O lond þer is þi kinde.” Þai busked and maked hem boun, Nas þer no leng abade; Þai lefted goinfainoun, And out of hauen þai rade Til þai com til atoun, A castel rohant had made. Her sailes þai leten doun, And kni?t, ouer bord þai strade Al cladde. Þe kni?tes þat wer fade, Þai dede as rohand bade. Rohand, ri?t he radde:— “Þis maiden schal ben oure, Roulandriis to wedde, At weld in castel tour, To bring hir to his bedde Þat bri?test is in bour. Nas neuer non fairer fedde Þan maiden blauncheflour Al bliþe.” After þat michel anour Parting com þer swiþe. In hird nas nou?t to hele Þat morgan telles in toun, Mekeliche he gan mele Among his men to roun; He bad his kni?tes lele Com to his somoun Wiþ hors and wepenes fele And rered goinfaynoun, Þat bold. He rode so king wiþ croun To win al þat he wold. Of folk þe feld was brade, Þer morgan men gan bide; Þo rouland to hem rade, O?ain him gun þai ride; Swiche meting nas neuer made Wiþ sorwe on ich aside. Þer of was rouland glade, Ful fast he feld her pride. Wiþ paine Morgan scaped þat tide Þat he nas nou?t slain. Morganes folk cam newe Of rouland riis þe gode, On helmes gun þai hewe, Þurch brinies brast þe blod; Sone to deþ þer drewe Mani a frely fode. Of rouland was to rewe, To grounde when he ?ode, Þat bold: His sone him after stode, And dere his deþ he sold. Rewþe mow ?e here Of roulandriis þe kni?t: Þrehundred he slou? þere Wiþ his swerd bri?t, Of al þo þat þer were Mi?t non him felle in fi?t, Bot on wiþ tresoun þere Þurch þe bodi him pi?t. Wiþ gile To deþ he him di?t— Allas þat ich while! His hors o feld him bare Alle ded hom in his way; Gret wonder hadde he þou?t þare Þat folk of ferly play. Þe tiding com wiþ care To blauncheflour, þat may. For hir me reweþ sare: On child bed þer sche lay Was born Of hir tristrem þat day, Ac hye no bade nou?t þat morn. A ring of riche hewe Þan hadde þat leuedi fre; Sche toke it rouhand trewe, Hir sone sche bad it be:— “Mi broþer wele it knewe, Mi fader ?af it me; King markes may rewe, Þe ring, þan he it se, And moun. As rouland loued þe, Þou kepe it to his sone.” Þe folk stode vnfain Bifor þat leuedi fre:— “Rouland, mi lord, is slain, He spekeþ no more wiþ me. Þat leuedi, nou?t to lain, For soþe ded is sche. Who may be ogain? As god wil, it schal be, Vnbliþe.” Sorwe it was to se, Þat leuedi swelted swiþe. Geten and born was so Þe child, was fair and white. Nas neuer rohand so wo, He nist it whom to wite. To child bed ded he go His owhen wiif al so tite And seyd he hadde children to, On hem was his delite Bicrist! In court men cleped him so:— Þo tram bifor þe trist. Douk morgan was bliþe Þo roulandriis was doun; He sent his sond swiþe And bad al schuld be boun And to his lores liþe, Redi to his somoun. Durst non o?ain him kiþe, Bot ?alt him tour and toun So sone: No was no king wiþ croun, So richeliche hadde y done. Who ?af broche and bei?e? Who bot douke morgan? Cruwel was and hei?e, O?aines him stode no man. To conseil he calleþ nei?e Rohand trewe so stan, And euer he dede as þe slei?e And held his hert in an, Þat wise. It brast þurch blod and ban ?if hope no ware to rise. Now haþ rohand in ore Tristrem and is ful bliþe. Þe child he set to lore And lernd him al so swiþe; In bok, while he was þore, He stodieþ euer, þat stiþe. Þo þat bi him wore Of him weren ful bliþe. Þat bold, His craftes gan he kiþe O?aines hem when he wold. Fiftene ?ere he gan him fede, Sir rohand þe trewe; He tau?t him ich alede Of ich maner of glewe And euerich playing þede, Old lawes and newe; On hunting oft he ?ede, To swiche alawe he drewe Al þus, More he couþe of veneri Þan couþe manerious. Þer com aschip of norway To sir rohandes hold Wiþ haukes white and gray And panes fair y fold. Tristrem herd it say, On his playing he wold Tventischilling to lay. Sir rouhand him told And tau?t; For hauke siluer he ?old, Þe fairest men him rau?t. A cheker he fond bi a cheire, He asked who wold play. Þe mariner spac bonair:— “Child, what wiltow lay?” “O?ain an hauke of noble air Tventi schillinges, to say. Wheþer so mates oþer fair Bere hem boþe oway.” Wiþ wille Þe mariner swore his faye:— “For soþe ich held þer tille.” Now boþe her wedde lys, And play þai bi ginne; Ysett he haþ þe long asise And endred beþ þer inne. Þe play biginneþ to arise, Tristem deleþ atvinne; He dede als so þe wise: He ?af has he gan winne In raf. Of playe ar he wald blinne, Sex haukes he ?at and ?af. Rohand toke leue to ga, His sones he cleped oway; Þe fairest hauke he gan ta Þat tristrem wan þat day; Wiþ him he left ma Pans for to play. Þe mariner swore also Þat pans wold he lay An stounde. Tristrem wan þat day Of him an hundred pounde. Tristrem wan þat þer was layd. A tresoun þer was made: No lenger þan þe maister seyd, Of gate nas þer no bade. As þai best sat and pleyd, Out of hauen þai rade Opon þe se so gray, Fram þe brimes brade Gun flete. Of lod þai were wel glade, And tristrem sore wepe. His maister þan þai fand A bot and anare. Hye seyden: “?ond is þe land, And here schaltow to bare. Chese onaiþer hand Wheþer þe leuer ware Sink or stille stand; Þe child schal wiþ ous fare On flod.” Tristrem wepe ful sare, Þai lou? and þou?t it gode. Ni?en woukes and mare Þe mariners flet on flod, Til anker hem brast and are And stormes hem bistode; Her sorwen and her care Þai witt þat frely fode; Þai nisten hou to fare, Þe wawes were so wode Wiþ winde. O lond þai wold he ?ede, ?if þai wist ani to finde. A lond þai nei?ed nei?e, A forest as it ware, Wiþ hilles þat were hei?e And holtes þat weren hare. O lond þai sett þat slei?e Wiþ al his wining ?are, Wiþ broche and riche bei?e, A lof of brede ?ete mare, Þat milde. Weder þai hadde to fare, A lond þai left þat childe. Winde þai had as þai wolde, A lond bilaft he; His hert bigan to cold, Þo he no mi?t hem nou?t se; To crist his bodi he ?ald, Þat don was on þe tre:— “Lord, mi liif me bihold, In world þou wisse me At wille; Astow art lord so fre, Þou lete me neuer spille.” Þo tomas asked ay Of tristrem, trewe fere, To wite þe ri?t way Þe styes for to lere. Of a prince proude in play Listneþ, lordinges dere. Who so better can say, His owhen he may here As hende. Of þing þat is him dere Ich man preise at ende. In o robe tristrem was boun Þat he fram schip hadde brou?t. Was of ablihand broun, Þe richest þat was wrou?t, As tomas telleþ in toun. He no wist what he mou?t, Bot semly sett him doun And ete ay til him gode þou?t; Ful sone Þe forest forþ he sou?t When he so hadde done. He toke his lod vnli?t, His penis wiþ him he bare; Þe hilles were on hi?t, He clombe þo holtes hare; Of o gate he hadde si?t, Þat he fond ful ?are; Þe paþ he toke ful ri?t, To palmers mett he þare On hand; He asked hem whennes þai ware, Þai seyd:—“of yngland.” For drede þai wald him slo, He temed him to þe king; He bede hem pens mo, Aiþer ten schilling, ?if þai wald wiþ him go And to þe court him bring. “?is” þai sworen þo Bi þe lord ouer al þing Ful sone. Ful wel biset his þing, Þat raþe haþ his bone. Þe forest was fair and wide, Wiþ wilde bestes y sprad. Þe court was ner bi side, Þe palmers þider him lad. Tristrem hunters sei?e ride, Les of houndes þai ledde; Þai token in þat tide Of fat hertes y fedde In feld. In blehand was he cledde, Þe hunters him biheld. Bestes þai brac and bare, In quarters þai hem wrou?t, Martirs as it ware Þat husbond men had bou?t. Tristrem þo spac þare And seyd wonder him þou?t:— “Ne sei?e y neuer are So wilde best y wrou?t At wille. Oþer,” he seyd, “y can nou?t, Or folily ?e hem spille.” Vp stode aseriaunt bold And spac tristem o?ain:— “We and our elders old, Þus þan haue we sain. Oþer þou hast ous told: ?ond liþ abest vnflain, Atire it as þou wold, And we wil se ful fain In feld.” In lede is nou?t to lain, Þe hunters him biheld. Tristrem schare þe brest, Þe tong sat next þe pride; Þe heminges swiþe on est He schar and layd bi side; Þe breche adoun he þrest, He ritt and gan to ri?t; Boldliche þer nest Carf he of þat hide Bidene; Þe bestes he graiþed þat tide, As mani seþþen has ben. Þe spande was þe first brede, Þe erber di?t he ?are, To þe stifles he ?ede And euen ato hem schare; He ri?t al þe rede, Þe wombe oway he bare, Þe noubles he ?af to mede. Þat sei?en þat þer ware Al so. Þe rigge he croised mare, Þe chine he smot atvo. Þe forster for his ri?tes Þe left schulder ?af he, Wiþ hert, liuer and li?tes And blod tille his quirre; Houndes on hyde he di?tes, Alle he lete hem se; Þe rauen he ?aue his ?iftes, Sat on þe fourched tre, On rowe; ‘Hunters, whare be ?e? Þe tokening schuld ?e blowe.” He ti?t þe mawe on tinde And eke þe gargiloun; Þai blewen þe ri?t kinde And radde þe ri?t roun. Þai wist þe king to finde And senten forþ to toun And teld him vnder linde Þe best, hou it was boun And brou?t. Marke, þe king wiþ croun, Seyd þat feir him þou?t. Þe tokening when þai blewe, Þer wondred mani aman; Þe costom þai nou?t knewe, For þi fro bord pai ran; No wist þai nou?t hou newe Þai hadde hunters þan. It is amaner of glewe To teche hem þat no can Swiche þing. Alle bliþe weren þai þan Þat ?ede bifor þe king. Pe king seyd:—“where were þou born? What hattou, belamye?” Tristrem spac biforn:— “Sir, in hermonie. Mi fader me haþ for lorn, Sir rohand, sikerly Þe best blower of horn And king of venery For þou?t.” Þe lasse ?af mark for þi, For rohand he no knewe nou?t. Þe king no seyd no more, Bot wesche and ?ede to mete; Bred þai pard and schare, Ynou? þai hadde at ete; Wheþer hem leuer ware Win or ale to gete, Aske and haue it ?are, In coupes or hornes grete Was brou?t; Þer, while þai wold, þai sete; And risen when hem gode þou?t. An harpour made alay, Þat tristrem, aresound he. Þe harpour ?ede oway:— “Who better can, lat se.” “Bot y þe mendi may, Wrong þan wite y þe.” Þe harpour gan to say:— “Þe maistri ?iue y þe Ful sket.” Bi for þe kinges kne Tristrem is cald to set. Bliþe weren þai alle, And merkes gun þai minne, Token leue in þe halle. Who mi?t þe child winne? Mark gan tristrem calle, Was comen of riche kinne; He ?af him robe of palle And pane of riche skinne Ful sket; His chaumber he liþ inne And harpeþ notes swete. Now tristrem lat we þare, Wiþ marke he is ful dere. Rohand reweþ sare Þat he no mi?t of him here; Ouer londes he gan fare Wiþ sorwe and reweful chere, Seuen kingriche and mare Tristrem to finde þere And sou?t; His robes riuen were, Þer fore no leued he nou?t. Nou?t no semed it so Rohand, þat noble kni?t; He no wist whider to go, So was he brou?t omi?t; To swinke men wold him to For mete and robes ri?t. Wiþ oþer werkmen mo He bileft al ni?t In land; Of þe palmers he hadde asi?t Þat tristrem first fand. His asking is euer newe In trauail and in pes. Þe palmer seyd he him knewe And wiste wele what he wes:— “His robe is of anhewe, Blihand wiþ outen les; His name is tristrem trewe, Bifor him scheres þe mes, Þe king. Y brou?t him þer he ches, He ?aue me tenschilling.” “So michel wil y ?iue þe,” Quaþ rohand, “will ?e ta? Þe court ?e lat me se.” Þe palmers seyd:—“?a.” Bliþe þer of was he And redily ?af him sa Of wel gode mone Ten schilinges and ma Of gayn: Tristrem was ful þra Of tristrem for to frain. In tristrem is his delit, And of him spekeþ he ay. Þe porter gan him wite And seyd:—“Cherl! go oway, Oþer y schal þe smite. What dostow here al day?” A ring he rau?t him tite —Þe porter seyd nou?t nay— In hand. He was ful wise, y say, Þat first ?aue ?ift in land. Rohand þo tok he And at þe gate in lete; Þe ring was fair to se, Þe ?ift was wel swete. Þe huscher bad him fle:— “Cherl, oway wel sket, Or broken þine heued schal be, And þou feld vnder fet To grounde.” Rohand bad him lete And help him at þat stounde. Þe pouer man of mold Tok forþ anoþer ring, Þe huscher he ?af þe gold, It seemed to a king; Formest þo in fold He lete him in þring; To tristrem trewe in hold He hete he wold him bring, And brou?t; Tristrem knewe him no þing, And ferly rohand þou?t. Þei men tristrem had sworn, He no trowed it neuer in lede Þat rohand robes were torn, Þat he wered swiche awede. He frained him biforn:— “Child, so god þe rede, How were þou fram rohand lorn? Monestow neuer in lede?” Nou?t lain He kneled better spede And kist rohand ful fain. “Fader, no wretþe þe nou?t, Ful welcom er ?e! Bi god, þat man haþ bou?t, No þing no knewe y þe; Wiþ sorwe þou hast me sou?t, To wite it wo is me!” To mark þe word he brou?t:— “Wil ?e mi fader se Wiþ si?t? Graiþed y wil he be, And seþþen schewe him as kni?t.” Tristrem to mark it seyd, His auentours, as it were, Hou he wiþ schipmen pleyd, Of lond hou þai him bere, Hou stormes hem bi stayd, Til anker hem brast and are. “Þai ?olden me þat y layd Wiþ al mi wining ?are In hand; Y clambe þe holtes hare Til y þine hunters fand.” A baþ þai brou?t rohand inne, A barbour was redi þare; Al rowe it was, his chinne, His heued was white of hare; A scarlet wiþ riche skinne Ybrou?t him was ful ?are. Rohand of noble kinne, Þat robe ful fair he bare, Þat bold; Who þat had seyn him þare A prince him mi?t han told. Fair his tale bi gan Rohand, þei he com lat; Tristrem, þat honour can, To halle led him þe gate. Ich man seyd þan Nas non swiche, as þai wate, As was þe pouer man Þat þai bete fram þe gat Wiþ care; Nas non þat wald him hate, Bot welcom was he þare. Water þai asked swiþe, Cloþ and bord was drain Wit mete and drink liþe And seriaunce þat were bayn To serue tristrem swiþe And sir rohand ful fayn; Whasche, when þai wald rise, Þe king ros him o?ain Þat tide; In lede is nou?t to layn, He sett him bi his side. Rohand, þat was þare, To mark his tale bi gan:— “Wist ?e what tristrem ware, Miche gode ?e wold him an. ?our owhen soster him bare,” —Þe king liþed him þan— “Y nam sibbe him na mare, Ich au?t to ben his man, Sir king. Knowe it ?iue ?e can, Sche tau?t me þis ring When roulandriis þe bold, Douke morgan gan mete.” Þe tale when rohand told, For sorwe he gan grete. Þe king biheld þat old, Hou his wonges were wete; To mark þe ring he ?old, He knewe it al so sket, Gan loke: He kist tristrem ful skete And for his nevou toke. Þo þai kisten him alle, Boþe leuedi and kni?t And seriaunce in þe halle And maidens þat were bri?t. Tristrem gan rohand calle And freined him wiþ si?t:— “Sir, hou may þis falle? Hou may y proue it ri?t? Nou?t lain? Tel me for godes mi?t Hou was mi fader slayn.” Rohand told anon His auentours al bidene, Hou þe batayle bi gan, Þe werres hadden y ben, His moder hou hye was tan And geten hem bi tvene. “Slawe was rouland þan And ded blaunche þe schene. Nau?t les, For dout of morgan kene Mi sone y seyd þou wes.” Tristrem, al in hei?e, Bifor þe king cam he. “Into ermonie, Sir, now longeþ me; Þider fare wil y, Mi leue y take of þe To fi?t wiþ morgan in hy, To sle him oþer he me Wiþ hand; Erst schal no man me se O?ain in ingland.” Po was mark ful wo, He si?t sore at þat tide. “Tristrem, þi rede þou ta In inglond forto abide. Morgan is wick to slo, Of kni?tes he haþ gret pride; Tristrem, þei þou be þro, Lat mo men wiþ þe ride On rowe. Take rohand bi þi side, He wil þine frendes knawe.” To armes þe king lete crie Þe folk of al his land To help tristrem: for þi He made kni?t wiþ his hand. He dede him han on heye Þe fairest þat he fand, In place to riden him by, To don him to vnder stand So swiþe. Sorwe so tristrem band Mi?t no man make him bliþe. No wold he duellen ani?t, Þer of nas nou?t to say. Ten hundred þat were wi?t Wenten wiþ him oway. Rohand, þe riche kni?t, Redy was he ay; To his castel ful ri?t He sailed þe seuenday On rade. His maister he gan pay, His sones kni?tes he made. His frendes, glad were þai —No blame hem noman for þi— Of his coming, to say, Al in to ermonie, Til it was on aday Morgan was fast by, Tristrem bi gan to say:— “Wiþ morgan speke wil y And spede. So long idel we ly, Miself mai do mi nede.” Tristrem dede as he hi?t. He busked and made him ?are Hi fiftend som of kni?t, Wiþ him ?ede na mare. To court þai com ful ri?t As Morgan his brede schare; Þai teld þo bi si?t Ten kinges sones þai ware; Vn sou?t Heuedes of wild bare Ichon to presant brou?t. Rohand bi gan to sayn, To his kni?tes þan seyd he:— “As woman is, tviis for lain, Y may say bi me. ?if tristrem be now sleyn, Yuel ?emers er we. To armes, kni?t and swayn, And swiftly ride ?e And swiþe! Til y tristrem se, No worþ y neuer bliþe.” Tristrem speke bi gan:— “Sir king, god loke þe As y þe loue and an And þou hast serued to me!” Þe douke answerd þan:— “Y pray, mi lord so fre, Wheþer þou blis or ban, Þine owhen mot it be, Þou bold! Þi nedes tel þou me, Þine erand, what þou wold.” “Amendes! Mi fader is slain, Mine hirritage hermonie!” Þe douke answerd ogain:— “Certes, þi fader þan slou? y. Seþþen þou so hast sayd, Amendes þer ou?t to ly. Þer fore, prout swayn, So schal y þe, for þi Ri?t þan Artow comen titly Fram marke þi kinsman. ?ongling, þou schalt abide! Foles þou wendest to fand! Þi fader þi moder gan hide, In horedom he hir band. Hou comestow wiþ pride? Out, traitour, of mi land!” Tristrem spac þat tide:— “Þou lext, ich vnder stand And wot!” Morgan wiþ his hand Wiþ a lof tristrem smot. On his brest adoun Of his nose ran þe blod. Tristrem swerd was boun, And ner þe douke he stode. Wiþ þat was comen to toun Rohand wiþ help ful gode And gayn. Al þat o?ain hem stode Wi?tly were þai slayn. To prisoun þai gun take Erl, baroun and kni?t; For douke morgan sake Mani on dyd doun ri?t. Schaftes þai gun schake And riuen scheldes bri?t, Crounes þai gun crake Mani, ich wene, apli?t. Saunfayl, Bitvene þe none and þe ni?t Last þe batayle. Þus haþ tristrem þe swete Yslawe þe douke morgan. No wold he neuer lete Til mo castels wer tan; Tounes þai ?old him skete And cites stiþe of stan. Þe folk fel to his fet, A?aines him stode þer nan In land. He slou? his fader ban, Al bowed to his hand. Tvo ?ere he sett þat land, His lawes made he cri. Al com to his hand Almain and ermonie, At his wil to stand Boun and al redy. Rohand he ?af þe wand And bad him sitt him bi, Þat fre. “Rohand lord make y To held þis lond of me. Þou and þine sones fiue Schul held þis lond of me; Þer while þou art o liue, Þine owhen schal it be. What halt it long to striue? Mi leue y take at te, Til inglond wil y riue, Mark, mi nem, to se Þat stounde.” Now boskes tristre þe fre To inglond for to founde. Bliþe was his bosking, And fair was his schip fare. Rohand he left king Ouer al his wining þare. Schipmen him gun bring To inglond ful ?are. He herd anewe tiding, Þat he herd neuer are; On hand Mani man wepen sare For ransoun to yrland. Marke schuld ?eld vnhold, Þei he were king wiþ croun, Þre hundred pounde of gold Ich ?er out of toun, Of siluer fair y fold Þre hundred pounde al boun, Of mone of amold Þre hundred pounde of latoun Schuld he; Þe ferþ ?ere, (aferly roun!) Þre hundred barnes fre. Þe truage was com to to Moraunt, þe noble kni?t; Yhold he was so A neten in ich afi?t. Þe barnes asked he þo Als it war londes ri?t. Tristrem gan stoutely go To lond þat ich ni?t Of rade; Of þe schippe þai hadde asi?t Þe day þai dede obade. Mark was glad and bliþe Þo he mi?t tristrem se; He kist him fele siþe, Welcom to him was he. Marke gan tidinges liþe, Hou he wan londes fre. Tristrem seyd þat siþe:— “Wat may þis gadering be? Þai grete.” “Tristrem, y telle it þe, A þing, is me vnswete. Þe king of yrlond, Tristrem, ich am his man. To long ichaue ben hir bond, Wiþ wrong þe king it wan. To long it haþ y stond, On him þe wrong bigan; Þer to ich held min hond.” Tristrem seyd þan Al stille, “Moraunt þat michel can Schal nou?t han his wille.” Marke to conseyl ?ede And asked rede of þis. He seyd:—“Wiþ wrong dede Þe raunsoun y taken is.” Tristrem seyd:—“y rede Þat he þe barnes mis.” Þo seyd þe king in lede:— “No was it neuer his Wiþ ri?t.” Tristrem seyd:—“y wis, Y wil defende it as kni?t.” Bi al markes hald Þe truwage was tan. Tristrem gan it wiþhald As prince proude in pan. Þai graunted þat tristrem wald, Oþer no durst þer nan; Nis þer non so bald Ymade of flesche no ban, No kni?t. Now haþ tristrem y tan O?ain moraunt to fi?t. Tristrem him self ?ede Moraunt word to bring, And schortliche seyd in lede:— “We no owe þe noþing.” Moraunt o?ain sede:— “Þou lexst afoule lesing! Mi body to batayl y bede To proue bi for þe king To loke.” He waged him aring, Tristrem þe batayl toke. Þai seylden in to þe wide Wiþ her schippes tvo; Moraunt bond his biside, And tristrem lete his go; Moraunt seyd þat tide:— “Tristrem, whi dos tow so?” “Our on schal here abide, No be þou neuer so þro, Y wis! Wheþer our to liue go, He haþ anou? of þis.” Þe yland was ful brade Þat þai gun in fi?t; Þer of was moraunt glade, Of tristrem he lete li?t. Swiche meting nas neuer non made Wiþ worþli wepen wi?t; Aiþer to oþer rade And hewe on helmes bri?t Wiþ hand. God help tristrem þe kni?t! He fau?t for ingland. Moraunt wiþ his mi?t Rode wiþ gret raundoun O?ain tristrem þe kni?t And þou?t to bere him doun. Wiþ alaunce vn li?t He smot him in þe lyoun, And tristrem, þat was wi?t, Bar him þurch þe dragoun In þe scheld. Þat moraunt bold and boun Smot him in þe scheld. Vp he stirt bidene And lepe opon his stede; He fau?t, wiþ outen wene, So wolf þat wald wede. Tristrem in þat tene No spard him for no drede; He ?af him awounde y sene, Þat his bodi gan blede. Ri?t þo In morauntes most nede His stede bak brak on to. Vp he stirt in drede And seyd:—“tristrem, ali?t; For þou hast slayn mi stede. A fot þou schalt fi?t.” Quaþ tristrem:—“so god me rede, Þer to icham al li?t.” Togider þo þai ?ede And hewen on helmes bri?t. Saunfayl, Tristrem as akni?t Fau?t in þat batayle. Moraunt of yrland smot Tristrem in þe scheld, Þat half fel fram his hond Þer adoun in þe feld. Tristrem, ich vnder stond, Anon þe strok him ?eld Wiþ his gode brond; Moraunt nei?e he queld, Þat kni?t. Marke þe batayl bi held And wonderd of þat fi?t. Moraunt was vnfayn And fau?t wiþ al his mi?t; Þat tristrem were y slayn He stird him as akni?t. Tristrem smot wiþ main, His swerd brak in þe fi?t And in morauntes brain Bileued apece bri?t Wiþ care; And in þe haunche ri?t Tristrem was wounded sare. A word þat pended to pride Tristrem, þo spac he:— “Folk of yrland side, Zour mirour ?e may se. Mo þat hider wil ride, Þus grayþed schul ?e be.” Wiþ sorwe þai drou? þat tide Moraunt to þe se And care. Wiþ ioie tristrem þe fre To mark, his em, gan fare. His swerd he offred þan And to þe auter it bare. For markes kinsman Tristrem was loued þare. A forward þai bi gan, Þer to þai alle sware: For þat lond fre he wan, Þat king he schuld be þare, To say, ?if he oliue ware After sir markes day. Þei tristrem li?t þenke, He is wounded ful sare; Leches wiþ salue and drink Him comeþ wide whare. Þai lorn al her swink, His pain was ay þe mare; No man no mi?t for stink Com þer tristrem ware Als þan; Ich man forsoke him þare Bot gouernayl, his man. Þre ?er in carebed lay Tristrem, þe trewe he hi?t, Þat neuer no dou?t him day For sorwe he hadde oni?t. For diol no man no may Sen on him wiþ si?t; Ich man, for soþe to say, For soke þo þat kni?t As þare; Þai hadde don what he mi?t, Þai no rou?t of his fare. Til it was on aday Til mark he gan him mene. Schortliche, soþe to say, Þis tale was hem bitvene:— “In sorwe ich haue ben ay Seþþen ich aliue haue ben.” Marke seyd:—“Wayleway Þat ich it schuld y sene, Swiche þing!” Tristrem, wiþ outen wene, A schip asked þe king. “Em,” he seyd, “y spille. Of lond kepe y namare: A schip þou bring me tille, Mine harp to play me þare, Stouer ynou? to wille To kepe me, son ?ou ?are.” Þei marke liked ille, Tristrem to schip þai bare And brou?t. Who wold wiþ him fare? Gouernayle no lete him nou?t. Tristremes schip was ?are, And asked his benisoun; Þe hauen he gan outfare, It hi?t carlioun. Ni?en woukes and mare He hobled vp and doun. A winde to wil him bare To a stede þer him was boun Nei?e hand: Deluelin hi?t þe toun, An hauen in irland. A winde þider him gan driue, Schipmen him sei?e nei?ehand; In botes þai gun him stiue And drou? him to þe land. A wounded man aliue In þe schip þai fand; He seyd bisiden aride Men wounded him and band Vnsounde. No man mi?t bi him stand For stinking of his wounde. Gouernail gan hem frain What hi?t þe se strand. “Deuelin,” þai seyd o gayn, Þe schipmen þat him fand. Þo was tristrem vnfain And wele gan vnder stand, Hir broþer hadde he slain Þat quen was of þe land In fi?t. Tristrem he gan doun lain And seyd tramtris he hi?t. In his schip was þat day Al maner of gle And al maner of lay In lond þat mi?t be. To þe quen þo seyd þay, Morauntes soster þe fre, Ywounded swiche a man lay Þat sorwe it was to se And care:— “A miriman were he ?if he o liue ware.” Sche was in deuelin, Þe fair leuedi, þe quene, Louesom vnder line And slei?est had y bene, And mest couþe of medicie; Þat was on tristrem sene: Sche brou?t him of his pine, To wite and nou?t at wene, To say, Sche sent him aplaster kene To cast þe stink oway. A morwe when it was day, Þe leuedy of hei?e priis Com þer tristrem lay And asked what he is. “Marchaund ich haue ben ay, Mi nam is tramtris. Robbers, for soþe to say, Slou? mine felawes, y wis, In þe se; Þai raft me fowe and griis, And þus wounded þai me.” An heye man he was like, Þei he wer wounded sare; His gles weren so sellike Þat wonder þou?t hem þare. His harp, his croude was rike, His tables, his ches he bare. Þai swore bi seyn patrike, Swiche sei?e þai neuer are Er þan: “?if he in hele ware, He wer amiri man.” Þe leuedi of hei?e kenne, His woundes schewe .. he lete, To wite his wo vnwinne; So grimli he gan grete, His bon brast vnder skinne, His sorwe was vnsete. Þai brou?t him to an inne, A baþ þai made him sket So liþe Þat tristrem, on his fet Gon he mi?t swiþe. Salues haþ he soft And drinkes þat er liþe; Þai no rou?t hou dere it bou?t, Bot held him al so swiþe. He made his play aloft, His gamnes he gan kiþe; For þi was tristrem oft To boure cleped fele siþe To sete; Ich man was lef to liþe, His mirþes were so swete. Pe king had adouhter dere Þat maiden ysonde hi?t, Þat gle was lef to here And romaunce to rede ari?t. Sir tramtris hir gan lere Þo wiþ al his mi?t What alle pointes were, To se þe soþe in si?t, To say. In yrlond nas no kni?t Wiþ ysonde durst play, Ysonde of hei?e priis, Þe maiden bri?t of hewe Þat wered fow and griis And scarlet þat was newe. In warld was non so wiis Of craft þat men knewe Wiþ outen sir tramtris, Þat al games of grewe On grounde. Hom longeþ tramtris þe trewe, For heled was his wounde. Sir tramtris in irlond Duelled al a?ere. So gode likeing he fand Þat hole he was and fere. Þe quen to fot and hand He serued dern and dere; Ysonde he dede vnder stand What alle playes were In lay. His leue he asked at here In schip to founde oway. Þe quen þat michel can, To tramtris sche gan say:— “Who so fet vncouþe man, He foundeþ euer oway.” His hire þai ?olden him þan, Gold and siluer, y say; What he wold he wan Of ysonde for his play Saunfail. He bi tau?t hem god and gode day, Wiþ him went gouernail. Riche sail þai drewe, White and red so blod; A winde to wil hem blewe, To carlioun þai ?ode. Now hat he tristrem trewe And fareþ ouer þe flod. Þe schip þe cuntre knewe, It þou?t hem ful gode. As þare Of wrake þai vnder stode, For on þai leten him fare. Þai tolden to þe king Þat þe schip had sain; Neuer of no tiding Nas mark þe king so fain. To toun þai gun him bring, Þe king ros him o gayn; Bliþe was her meteing, And fair he gain him frain Þat stounde: “Tristrem, nou?t to lain, Heled is þi wounde?” His em answer he ?eld Þat litel he wald wene; Of bot sche was him beld Þat moraunt soster had bene. Hou fair sche haþ him held, He told hem al bidene; And seþþen tristrem haþ teld Of ysonde þat was kene, Al newe, Hou sche was bri?t and schene, Of loue was non so trewe. Mark to tristrem gan say:— “Mi lond bi take y þe To han after mi day; Þine owhen schal it be. Bring þou me þat may Þat ich hir may y se.” Þis was his maner ay, Of ysonde þan spekeþ he, Her prise, Hou sche was gent and fre, Of loue was non so wise. In inglond ful wide Þe barouns hem bi þou?t To fel tristremes pride Hou þai fairest mou?t; Þe king þai rad to ride, A quen to him þai sou?t Þat tristrem mi?t abide Þat he no were it nou?t, No king: Þai seyd þat tristrem mou?t Ysonde of irlond bring. A brid bri?t þai ches As blod opon snoweing: “A maiden of swiche reles Tristrem may to þe bring.” Quaþ tristrem:—“It is les, And troweþ it forlesing; To aski þat neuer no wes, It is a fole askeing Bi kinde; It is a selli þing, For noman may it finde. Y rede ?e nou?t no striue; A swalu ich herd sing: ?e sigge ich wern mi nem to wiue, For y schuld be ?our king. Now bringeþ me atte riue Schip and oþer þing. ?e se me neuer oliue Bot ?if ich ysonde bring, Þat bri?t. Finde me min askeing, Mine fiftend som of kni?t.” Kni?tes þo chosen þai Þat were war and wise, Al þat mest may And hei?est weren of priis; A schip wiþ grene and gray, Wiþ vair and eke wiþ griis, Wiþ alle þing, y say, Þat pende to marchandis, In lede. Þai ferden of þis wise In til yrlond þede. In his schip was boun Al þat mister ware; Out of carlioun Riche was his schip fare. Þai rered goinfaynoun, A winde to wille hem bare. Deuelin hat þe toun, To lond þai comen þare, Þe best; Þe king present þai bare And asked leue to rest. Þe king present þai brou?t, Anoþer to þe quene; Ysonde for?at þai nou?t, To wite and nou?t at wene. To schip when þai hem þou?t Þat at þe court hadde bene, —Swiche mayde nas neuer wrou?t Þat þai euer hadde sene Wiþ si?t— Þe cuntre alle bidene Þai sei?e fle ful ri?t. Out of deuelin toun Þe folk wel fast ran In awater to droun, So ferd were þai þan. For doute of o dragoun, Þai seyd, to schip þai wan To hauen þat were boun; No rou?t þai of, what man In lede Þat may him sle or can, Ysonde schal haue to mede. Tristrem, bliþe was he, He cleped his kni?tes stiþe: “What man he is, las se, Þat take þis bataile swiþe.” Alle þai beden lat be, Durst non him seluen kiþe. “For nede now wo is me!” Seyd Tristrem þat siþe Ri?t þan. Listen now, who wil liþe Al of an hardi man. A stede of schip þai drewe, Þe best þat he hadde brou?t; His armes weren al newe, Þat richeliche were wrou?t. His hert was gode and trewe, No failed it him nou?t. Þe cuntre wele he knewe, Er he þe dragoun sou?t And sei?e. Helle fere, him þou?t, Fram þat dragoun flei?e. Asaut to þat dragoun Tristrem toke þat tide As aloþely lioun Þat bataile wald abide; Wiþ a spere feloun He smot him in þe side; It no vailed o botoun, Oway it gan to glide, His dent; Þe deuel dragouns hide Was hard so ani flint. Tristrem, al in tene, Eft þat spere tok he; O?ain þat dragoun kene It brast on peces þre. Þe dragoun smot bi dene, Þe stede he gan sle; Tristrem, wiþ outen wene, Stirt vnder atre Al stille And seyd:—“god in trinite, No lat þou me nou?t spille.” O?ain þat fende dragoun A fot he tok þe fi?t; He fau?t wiþ his fauchoun As adouhti kni?t; His neþer chauel he smot doun Wiþ astroke of mi?t; Þo was þe dragon boun And cast fere ful ri?t And brend; His armes þat were bri?t, Schamliche he haþ hem schent. Swiche fer he cast o?ain Þat brend scheld and ston. Now liþ his stede y slain, His armes brent ichon. Tristrem rau?t his brain And brak his nek bon; No was he neuer so fain As þan þat batail was don; To bote His tong haþ he ton And schorn of bi þe rote. In his hose next þe hide Þe tong oway he bar. No ?ede he bot ten stride, His speche les he þar; Nedes he most abide Þat he no may ferþer far. Þe steward com þat tide, Þe heued oway he schar And brou?t And tok it ysonde þar And seyd dere he hadde hir bou?t. Þe steward wald ful fain Han ysonde, ?if he mou?t. Þe king answerd ogain, Fair þe bataile him þou?t. Ysonde, nou?t to lain, Of him no wil sche nou?t; Þere þe dragoun was slain, Hye and hir moder sou?t Al so Who þat wonder wrou?t, Þat durst þat dragoun slo. “Dede þe steward þis dede?” “Certes,” quaþ ysonde, “nay. Þis ich brende stede No au?t he neuer aday, No þis riche wede Nas neuer his, soþe to say.” Forþer als þai ?ede, A man þai founde whare lay And drou?: “Certes,” þan seyd þai, “Þis man þe dragoun slou?.” His mouþe opened þai And pelt treacle in þat man. When Tristrem speke may, Þis tale he bi gan And redyli gan to say Hou he þe dragoun wan:— “Þe tong y bar oway, Þus venimed he me þan.” Þai loke. Þe quen þat michel can Out of his hose it toke. Þai sei?en he hadde þe ri?t, Þe steward hadde þe wou?, And ?if he durst fi?t Wiþ him þe dragoun slou?, Tristrem spak as akni?t, He wold proue it anou?; So noblelich he hem hi?t, Þer of ysonde lou? Þat tide; To his waraunt he drou? His schippe and al his pride. Pe quen asked what he is, Þat durst þe dragon abide. “Marchaunt icham, y wis, Mi schip liþ here bi side. He seyt he haþ don þis; Prouen ichil his pride Er he ysonde kisse.” O?aines him wald he ride Wiþ mi?t. Ysonde seyd þat tide:— “Allas þat þou ner kni?t!” Her chaumpioun þat day Richeliche gun þai fede, Til hem þink þat he may Don adouhti dede. His armes, long were þai, His scholders large on brede. Þe quen, for soþe to say, To a baþ gan him lede Ful gayn, And seþþen hir self sche ?ede After adrink of main. Ysonde bri?t of hewe Þou?t it tramtris ware. His swerd, sche gan it schewe, And broken hye fond it þare; Out of a cofer newe Þe pece sche drou? ful ?are And sett it to þat trewe: It nas lasse no mare, Bot ri?t. Þo þou?t ysonde wiþ care To sle tristrem þe kni?t. Ysonde to tristrem ?ode Wiþ his swerd al drain. “Moraunt, mi nem þe gode, Traitour, þou hast slain; For þi þine hert blode Sen ich wold ful fain.” Þe quen whende sche were wode, Sche com wiþ adrink of main And lou?: “Nay, moder, nou?t to layn, Þis þef mi broþer slou?. Tristrem, þis þef is he, Þat may be nou?t for lain; Þe pece þou mi?t her se Þat fro mi nem was drain. Loke þat it so be, Sett it euen o gain.” As quik þai wald him sle Þer, tristrem, ful fain; Soþ þing, In baþ þai hadden him slain, No were it for þe king. And euer tristrem lou? On swete ysonde, þe bri?t:— “Þou mi?t haue slain me ynou? Þo þat y tramtris hi?t; ?e witeþ me wiþ wou? Of moraunt, þe noble kni?t; Y graunt wele ichim slou?

Þo y tramtris hi?t, Y lerld þe play and song, And euer wiþ al mi mi?t Of þe y spac among To marke, þe riche kni?t, Þat after þe he gan long.” So swore he day and ni?t, And borwes fond he strong Bidene, Amendes of al wrong, Þat ysonde schuld be quen. Tristrem swore þat þing; Þai seyd it schuld stand Þat he schuld ysonde bring —Þai token it vnder hand— To mark, þe riche king, Oliue ?if þai him fand, And make hir wiþ his ring Quen of ingeland, To say; Þe forward fast þai band Er þai parted oway. Pe steward for soke his dede Þo he herd he tristrem hi?t; Þe king swore, so god him spede, Þat boþen schuld haue ri?t; Þe steward seyd wrong þer ?ede, For þi nold he nou?t fi?t. Tristrem to his mede Þai ?olden ysonde þe bri?t; To bring To prisoun þat oþer kni?t Þe maiden bisekeþ þe king. No asked he lond no liþe, Bot þat maiden bri?t; He busked him al so swiþe, Boþe squier and kni?t. Her moder about was bliþe And tok adrink of mi?t, Þat loue wald kiþe, And tok it brengwain þe bri?t To þink: “At er spouseing ani?t ?if mark and hir to drink.” Ysonde bri?t of hewe Is fer out in þe se. A winde o?ain hem blewe Þat sail no mi?t þer be. So rewe þe kni?tes trewe, Tristrem, so rewe he, Euer as þai com newe— He on o?ain hem þre— Gret swink. Swete ysonde þe fre Asked bringwain adrink. Þe coupe was richeli wrou?t, Of gold it was, þe pin; In al þe warld nas nou?t Swiche drink as þer was in. Brengwain was wrong bi þou?t, To þat drink sche gan win And swete ysonde it bi tau?t; Sche bad tristrem bigin, To say. Her loue mi?t no man tvin Til her endingday. An hounde þer was biside, Þat was y cleped hodain; Þe coupe he licked þat tide Þo doun it sett bringwain; Þai loued al in lide And þer of were þai fain; To gider þai gun abide In ioie and ek in pain For þou?t: In iuel time, to sain, Þe drink was y wrou?t. Tristrem in schip lay Wiþ ysonde ich ni?t, Play miri he may Wiþ þat worþli wi?t In boure ni?t and day. Al bliþe was þe kni?t, He mi?t wiþ hir play; Þat wist brengwain þe bri?t As þo; Þai loued wiþ al her mi?t, And hodain dede al so. Tvai wikes in þe strand No seyl þai no drewe; Into inglond A winde to wille hem blewe. Þe king on hunting þai fand; A knaue þat he knewe, He made him kni?t wiþ hand For his tidinges newe, Gan bring. Ysonde bri?t of hewe Þer spoused mark þe king. He spoused hir wiþ his ring, Of fest no speke y nou?t. Brengwain, wiþ outen lesing, Dede as hye had þou?t; Sche tok þat loue drink, Þat in yrlond was bou?t. For ysonde to þe king Brengwain to bed was brou?t Þat tide; Mark his wille wrou?t On bed brengwain biside. When mark had tint his swink, Ysonde to bed ?ede; Of yrlond-hye asked drink, Þe coupe sche gan hir bede, Biside hir sche lete it sink; Þer of hadde sche no nede, Of non maner þing O?ain tristrem, in lede, As þo; No mi?t no clerk it rede, Þe loue bitven hem to. Þai wende haue ioie anou?, Certes, it nas nou?t so. Her wening was al wou? Vntroweand til hem to; Aiþer in langour drou?, And token rede to go; And seþþen ysonde lou? When tristrem was in wo Wiþ wille. Now þenkeþ ysonde to slo Brengwain and hir to spille. Sche þou?t: “y may be wroþ: Sche lay first bi þe king, For y bi hi?t hir cloþ, Gold and riche wedding; Tristrem and y boaþe Beþ schent for our playing: Better is þat we raþe Hir o liue bring Al stille. Þan doute we for no þing Þat we ne may han our wille.” Þe quen bad her biside To werkemen on aday; Sche told hem at þat tide What was her wille to say:— “?e moten slen and hide Bringwain, þat miri may.” Sche seyd:—“?e schal abide Riche to ben ay In lede: No lete ?e for no pay Þat ?e no do þat dede.” Into a grisly clou?

Whi wille ?e spille mi blode?” “Nou?t lain, Ysonde, þe leuedi gode, Haþ hot þou schalt be slain.” Brengwain dernly Bad hem say þe quen:— “Greteþ wele mi leuedy, Þat ai trewe haþ ben. Smockes hadde sche and y, And hir was solwy to sen, Bi mark þo hye schuld ly; Y lent hir min al clen As þare; O?ain hir, wele y wen, No dede y neuer mare.” Þai nold hir nou?t slo, Bot went o?ain to þe quen; Ysonde asked hem to:— “What seyd hye ?ou bitven?” “Hye bad ous say ?ou so: ?our smock was solwy to sen, Bi mark þo ?e schuld ly; Y lent hir min al clene Þat day.” Þo asked ysonde þe ken:— “Whare is þat trewe may?” Þo seyd ysonde wiþ mode:— “Mi maiden ?e han slain.” Sche swore bi godes rode Þai schuld ben hong and drain; Sche bede hem ?iftes gode To fechen hir o gain. Þai fetten hir þer sche stode; Þo was ysonde ful fain, To say; So trewe sche fond brengwain Þat sche loued hir wele ay. Made was þe sau?tening And alle for?eue bi dene. Tristrem, wiþ outen lesing, Played wiþ þe quen. Fram irlond to þe king An harpour com bi tven; An harp he gan forþ bring, Swiche no hadde þai neuer sen Wiþ si?t; Him self, wiþ outen wen, Bar it day and ni?t. Ysonde he loued in are, He þat þe harp brou?t; About his hals he it bare, Richelich it was wrou?t; He hidde it euer mare, Out no com it nou?t. “Þine harp whi wiltow spare, ?if þou þer of can ou?t Of gle?” “Out no comeþ it nou?t Wiþ outen ?iftes fre.” Mark seyd, “lat me se Harpi hou þou can, And what þou askest me ?iue y schal þe þan.” “Bleþely,” seyd he; A miri lay he bigan. “Sir king of ?iftes fre, Her wiþ ysonde y wan Bidene. Y proue þe for falsman, Or y schal haue þi quen.” Mark to conseyl ?ede And asked rede of þo to: “Lesen y mot mi manhed Or ?eld ysonde me fro.” Mark was ful of drede, Ysonde lete he go. Tristrem in þat nede At wode was, dere to slo, Þat day; Tristrem com ri?t þo As ysonde was o way. Þo was tristrem in ten And chidde wiþ þe king: “?ifstow glewemen þi quen? Hastow no noþer þing?” His rote, wiþ outen wen, He rau?t bi þe ring; Þo folwed tristrem þe ken To schip þer þai hir bring So bliþe; Tristrem bigan to sing, And ysonde bigan to liþe. Swiche song he gan sing Þat hir was swiþe wo; Her com swiche louelonging, Hir hert brast nei?e ato. Þerl to hir gan spring Wiþ kni?tes mani mo And seyd, “Mi swete þing, Whi farestow so, Y pray?” Ysonde to lond most go, Er sche went o way. “Wiþin astounde of þe day Y schal ben hole and sounde; Ich here amenstrel, to say, Of tristrem he haþ asoun.” Þerl seyd, “daþet him ay Of tristrem ?if þis stounde! Þat minstrel for his lay Schal haue an hundred pounde Of me, ?if he wil wiþ ous founde, Lef, for þou louest his gle.” His gle al for to here Þe leuedi was sett onland To play bi þe riuere; Þerl ladde hir bi hand; Tristrem, trewe fere, Mirie notes he fand Opon his rote of yuere, As þai were on þe strand; Þat stounde Þurch þat semly sand Ysonde was hole and sounde. Hole sche was and sounde Þurch vertu of his gle; For þi þerl, þat stounde Glad a man was he; Of penis to hundred pounde He ?af tristrem þe fre; To schip þan gun þai founde, In yrlond wald þai be Ful fain, Þerl and kni?tes þre Wiþ ysonde and bringwain. Tristrem tok his stede And lepe þer on to ride; Þe quen bad him her lede To schip him bi side; Tristrem dede as hye bede, In wode he gan hir hide. To þerl he seyd, “in þat nede Þou hast y tent þi pride, Þou dote! Wiþ þine harp þou wonne hir þat tide, Þou tint hir wiþ mi rote.” Tristrem wiþ ysonde rade Into þe wode oway. A loghe þai founden made, Was ful of gamen and play; Her blis was ful brade, And ioieful was þat may. Seuen ni?t þai þare abad And seþþen to court com þai. “Sir king,” Tristrem gan to say, “?if minstrels oþer þing.” Meriadok was aman Þat tristrem trowed ay; Miche gode he him an, In o chaumber þai lay. Tristren to ysonde wan A ni?t wiþ hir to play; As man þat miche kan, A bord he toke oway Of her bour. Er he went, to say, Of snowe was fallen aschour. A schour þer was y falle, Þat al þe way was white; Tristrem was wo wiþ alle, Wiþ diol, and sorwe site. Bitven þe bour and þe halle Þe way was naru and lite. Swiche cas him was bi falle As we finde in scrite. Ful sket A siue he fond tite And bond vnder his fete. Meriadok wiþ his mi?t Aros vp al bi dene; Þe way he went ri?t Til he com to þe quen; Þe bord he fond of tvi?t, To wite and nou?t at wene. Of tristrem kertel þe kni?t He fond a pece grene Of tore; Meriadok þe kene Wondred þer fore. A morwe he tolde þe king Al þat he sei?e wiþ si?t. “Lord, wiþ outen lesing, Wiþ ysonde lay tristrem to ni?t. Þou schalt do swiche a þing, Aske who her ?eme mi?t. Þe croice to ierusalem bring Say þou hast y hi?t, ?if þou may. Tristrem þe noble kni?t, Þe quen hir self wil say.” Þe king told þe quen, A bed þo þai ware, “Dame, wiþ outen wene, To ierusalem y mot fare; Loke now ous bi tvene, Who may þe kepe fram care?” “For al oþer bidene Tristrem,” sche seyd þare, “For þan Y loue him wele þe mare, He is þi kinsseman.” Al þat mark hir told A morwe hye told bringwain, “Of lond wil þis bold: Now we may be ful fain. Tristrem þe court schal hold Til he com o?ain.” Brengwain answere ?olde, “?our dedes han ben sain Wiþ si?t. Mark þi self schal frain Al oþer loker to ni?t. Wite þou wele his wille, To wende wiþ him þou say, And ?if he loueþ þe stille, Þou do tristrem oway. Biseche him he se þer tille, Þi fo is tristrem ay. Þou dredest he wil þe spille, ?if he þe maistrie may Aboue; Þou louedest him neuer aday Bot for þi nemes loue.” Ysonde þe nexst ni?t Crid, “mark, þi nore! Mi fo þou hast me hi?t, On me þou sinnes sore. Gode ?if þou hadde me hi?t Of lond wiþ þe to fare, And sle tristrem þe kni?t, ?if loue of þe no ware Þis day; For mani man seyt ay whare Þat tristrem bi me lay.” Mark is bliþe and glad, For al þat trowed he; He þat him oþer tald, He ne couþe him bot maugre. Meriadok him answere ?ald, “In toun þou do him be. Her loue laike þou bi hald For þe loue of me. Nou?t wene, Bi resoun þou schalt se Þat loue is hem bitvene.” Mark departed hem to And dede tristrem oway; Nas neuer ysonde so wo No tristrem, soþe to say. Ysonde her self wald slo, For sorwe tristrem lay. Ysonde morned so And tristrem ni?t and day For dede. Ich man it se may, What liif for loue þai lede. Tristrem was in toun, In boure ysonde was don. Bi water he sent adoun Li?t linden spon. He wrot hem al wiþ roun; Ysonde hem knewe wel sone; Bi þat tristrem was boun, Ysonde wist his bone To abide. Er amorwe none Her aiþer was oþer biside. Quaþ meriadok, “y rede Þine hunters þou bid ride Fourtenni?t at þis nede To se þine forestes wide. Tristrem þou hem bede, Þi self þou here abide, And ri?t at her dede Þou schalt hem take þat tide In þe tre. Here þou schalt abide, Her semblaunt þou schalt se.” In orchard mett þai inne, Tristrem and ysonde fre; Ay when þai mi?t a winne, Þer playd ysonde and he. Þe duerwe y sei?e her ginne Þer he sat in þe tre. Mark of riche kinne He hi?t to don him se Wiþ si?t And seyd, “sir, siker ?e be, Þi self schal se þat ri?t.” His falsnesse for to fille Forþ þo went he; To tristrem he com wiþ ille Fram ysonde þe fre, “Mileuedy me sent þe tille, For icham priue, And praieþ þe wiþ wille Þat þou wost hir se Wiþ si?t: Mark is in oþer cuntre, Priue it schal be di?t.” Tristrem him bi þou?t: “Maister, þank haue ?e. For þou me þis bode brou?t Mi robe ?iue y þe; Þat þou no lete it nou?t Say þat leuedy fre. Hir wordes dere y bou?t, To marke hye bilei?e me, Þat may: To morwe y schal hir se At chirche, for soþe to say.” Þe duerwe toke þe gate, And mark he told bidene: “Bi þis robe y wate Þat michel he loueþ þe quene. Ysame we nou?t no sat, He douteþ me bi tvene; It semeþ by his lat As he hir neuer had sene Wiþ si?t: Y wot wiþ outen wene He comeþ to hir to ni?t.” Sir mark sat in þe tre Þer metten þai to. Þe schadowe tristrem gan se And loude spac he þo, Þat ysonde schuld mark se And calle tristrem hir fo: “Þou no au?test nou?t here to be, Þou no hast nou?t here to go, No þing: Wiþ ri?t men schuld þe slo, Durst y for þe king. Ysonde, þou art mi fo, Þou sinnest, leuedi, on me; Þou gabbest on me so, Mi nem nil me nou?t se; He þreteneþ me to slo. More menske were it to þe Better for to do, Bi god in trinite, Þis tide; Or y þis lond schal fle Into wales wide.” “Tristrem, for soþe to say, Y wold þe litel gode, Ac y þe wraied neuer day, Y swere bi godes rode! Men said þou bi me lay, Þine em so vnder stode. Wende forþ in þi way, It semes astow were wode, To wede: Y loued neuer man wiþ mode Bot him þat hadde mi maidenhede.” “Swete ysonde, þi nare! Þou preye þe king for me, ?if it þi wille ware Of sake he make me fre. Of lond ichil elles fare, Schal he me neuer se.” Markes hert was sare Þer he sat in þe tre And þou?t: “Vn giltles er ?e In swiche a sclaunder brou?t.” “Þou seyst y gan þe wrie, Men seis þou bi me lay, Ac þei ich wende to dye, Þine erand y schal say. Marke þi nem his hei?e, Anou? he þe ?iue may; No reche y what y li?e, So þat þou be o way Wiþ wille.” Marke þo þou?t ay, “?ete he schal duelle stille.” Tristrem o way went so, Ysonde to boure, y wis; Nas neuer mark so wo, Him self he herd al þis. Al sori mark gan go Til he mi?t tristrem kisse, And dedely hated he þo Him þat seyd amis. Al newe Þer was ioie and blis, And welcom tristrem trewe. Now haþ ysonde her wille, Tristrem constable is hei?e. Þre ?ere he playd stille Wiþ ysonde bri?t so bei?e; Her loue mi?t no man felle, So were þai boþe slei?e. Meriadok wiþ ille Waited hem ful nei?e Of her dede: ?if he mi?t hem spille, Fain he wald spede. Meriadok wrayeþ ay, To þe king þus seyd he “Her folies vsen þai ay, Wel ?ore y seyd it þe. Loke now on aday And blod lat ?ou þre; Do as y þe say, And tokening þou schalt se Ful sone: Her bed schal blodi bene, Ar he his wille haue done.” Blod leten was þe king, Tristrem and þe quene; At her blod leteing Þe flore was swopen clene; Meriadok dede floure bring And strewed it bi tvene, Þat go no mi?t no þing Bot ?if it were sene Wiþ si?t. Þritti fet bi dene Tristrem lepe þat ni?t. Now tristrem willes is Wiþ ysonde for to play; He no may hir com to kisse, So ful of floure it lay. Tristrem lepe, ywis, Þritti fete, soþ to say. As tristrem dede þis, His blod bende brast oway And bled; And seþþen o?ain þe day He lepe fram hir bedde. Þritti fete bitvene He lepe, wiþ outen les; Sore him greued his vene, As it no wonder nes. Mark her bed hadde sen, And al blodi it wes. He told þo brengwain Tristrem hadde broken his pes Bitvene. Anon of lond he ches Out of markes ei?e sene. Tristrem was fled oway, To wite and nou?t to wene. At londen on a day Mark wald spourge þe quen. Men seyd sche brak þe lay; A bischop ?ede bi tvene; Wiþ hot yren, to say, Sche þou?t to make hir clene Of sake. Ysonde said bidene Þat dome sche wald take. Men sett þe merkes þere At westeminster ful ri?t, Hot yren to bere For sir tristrem þe kni?t. In pouer wede to were Tristrem com þat ni?t — Of alle þe kni?tes here No knewe him non bi si?t Bidene — To swete ysonde bri?t, As forward was hem bitvene. Ouer temes sche schuld ride, Þat is an arm of þe se: “To þe schip side Þis man schal bere me.” Tristrem hir bar þat tide And on þe quen fel he Next her naked side, Þat mani man mi?t y se San schewe. Hir queynt abouen hir kne Naked þe kni?tes knewe. In water þai wald him sink And wers, ?if þai may. “?e quite him iuel his swink.” Þe quene seyd to hem ay. “It semeþ mete no drink Hadde he nou?t mani aday; For pouerte, meþenk, He fel, for soþe to say, And nede: ?eueþ him gold, y pray; He may bidde god me spede.” Gold þai ?ouen him þare, Þe constori þai bi gan. Swete ysonde sware Sche was giltles woman: “Bot on to schip me bare, Þe kni?tes sei?e wele þan; What so his wille ware, Ferli nei?e he wan, Soþe þing; So nei?e com neuer man Bot mi lord þe king.” Swete ysonde haþ sworn Hir clene, þat miri may; To hir þai had y corn Hot yren, y say. Þe kni?tes were bi forn, For hir þo praiden þai. Þe yren sche hadde y born, Ac mark for?aue þat day And dede: Meriadok held þai For fole in his falshede. Ysonde is graunted clene Meriadok, maugre his; Neuer er nas þe quen So wele wiþ mark, y wis. Tristrem, wiþ outen wene, Into wales he is; In bataile he haþ ben And fast he fraines þis Ri?t þare: For he ne may ysonde kisse, Fi?t he sou?t ay whare. In wales þo was aking Þat hi?t triamour, He hadde adouhter ?ing, Was hoten blauncheflour. Vrgan wiþ gret wering Biseged him in his tour To winne þat swete þing And bring hir to his bour Wiþ fi?t. Tristrem wiþ gret honour Bicom þe kinges kni?t. Vrgan gan wales held Wiþ wrong, for soþe to say; Oft and vnselde Of triamour tok he pray. Triamour to tristrem teld Opon asomersday, Wales he wald him ?eld, ?if he it winne may Ri?t þan. Tristrem, wiþ outen nay, Wiþ were wales wan. Tristrem mett vrgan In þat feld to fi?t; To him seyd he þan As adouhti kni?t: “Þou slou? mi broþer morgan At þe mete ful ri?t. As y am douhti man, His deþ þou bist to ni?t, Mi fo.” Tristrem seyd: “apli?t! So kepe y þe to slo.” Tvelue fete was þe wand Þat vrgan wald wiþ play, His strok may no man stand, Ferly ?if tristrem may! Tristrem vantage fand, His clobbe fel oway, And of þe geauntes hand Tristrem smot þat day In lede; Tristrem, for soþe to say, Þe geaunt gert he blede. Vrgan, al in tene, Fau?t wiþ his left hand O?ain tristrem kene; A stern stroke he fand Opon his helme so schene, Þat to þe grounde he wand; Bot vp he stirt bidene And heried godes sand Almi?t; Tristrem wiþ his brand Fast gan to fi?t. Þe geaunt aroume he stode, His hond he tint, y wis; He flei?e as he were wode, Þer þat þe castel is. Tristrem trad in þe blod And fond þe hond þat was his; Oway sir tristrem ?ode. Þe geaunt com wiþ þis And sou?t To hele his honde þat was his; Salues hadde he brou?t. Vrgan, þe geaunt vnride, After sir tristrem wan; Þe cuntre fer and wide Ygadred was bi þan; Tristrem þou?t þat tide: “Y take þat me gode an.” On abrigge he gan abide, Biheld þer mani aman; Þai mett: Vrgan to tristrem ran, And grimli þere þai gret. Strokes of michel mi?t Þai delten hem bi tvene, Þat þurch her brinies bri?t Her boþer blod was sene; Tristrem fau?t as akni?t, And vrgan, al in tene, ?af him astroke vnli?t; His scheld he clef bi tvene A tvo; Tristrem, wiþ outen wene, Nas neuer are so wo. Eft vrgan smot wiþ main And of þat stroke he miste; Tristrem smot ogayn And þurch his body he þreste; Vrgan lepe vnfain, Ouer þe bregge he deste. Tristrem haþ vrgan slain, Þat alle þe cuntre wist Wiþ wille; Þe king þo tristrem kist And wales þo ?eld him tille. Þe king, a welp he brou?t Bifor tristrem þe trewe; What colour he was wrou?t Now ichil ?ou schewe. Silke nas non so soft, He was rede, grene and blewe. Þai þat him sei?en oft Of him hadde gamen and glewe, Y wis. His name was peti crewe, Of him was michel priis. Þe king triamour ?af him tristrem þe hende, For he brou?t out of dolour Him and al his kende Tristrem wiþ gret honour Kidde þat he was hende: He ?af to blauncheflour Wales wiþ outen end Bidene, And peticrowe he gan sende To dame ysonde þe quene. Ysonde, wiþ outen les, Þo hye þe welp had sain, Þat sche had made his pes Sche sent word ogayn. Mark herd hou it wes Þat vrgan had he slain; Messangers he ches Tristrem for to frain, Þat fre. Mark was ferly fain, And tristrem kist he. Mark gan tristrem calle And toke him al bidene Cites, castels alle, Steward as he hadde bene. Who was bliþe in halle Bot ysonde þe quene? Hou so it schuld bi falle, Þai playden ai bitvene, Þo tvo; So long of loue þai mene Þat mark sei?e it was so. Mark sei?e hou it is, What loue was hem bitvene; Certes, þis þou?t was his, Ful wele awreken to ben; He cleped tristrem wiþ þis And bi toke him þe quene, And flemed hem boþe, y wis, Out of his ei?e sene Away. Bliþer, wiþ outen wene, Neuer ere nar þay. A forest fled þai tille, Tristrem and ysonde þe schene. No hadde þai no won to wille Bot þe wode so grene. Bi holtes and bi hille Fore tristrem and þe quene; Ysonde of ioie haþ her fille And tristrem, wiþ outen wene, As þare: So bliþe al bi dene Nar þai neuer are. Tristrem and þat may Wer flemed for her dede; Hodain, soþ to say, And peti crowe wiþ hem ?ede. In on erþe hous þai lay, Þo raches wiþ hem þai lede. Tristrem hem tau?t o day Bestes to take at nede An hast. In þat forest fede Tristrem hodain gan chast. Tristrem wiþ hodain A wilde best he slou?; In on erþe house þai layn, Þer hadde þai ioie y nou?.

For loue ich oþer bi halt, Her non mi?t of oþer fille. Tristrem on an hille stode, As he biforn hadde mett; He fond awele ful gode, Al white it was, þe grete; Þer to tristrem ?ode And hende ysonde þe swete. Þat was al her fode, And wilde flesche þai ete And gras: Swiche ioie hadde þai neuer ?ete Tvelmoneth þre woukes las. Tristrem on aday Tok hodain wel erly, A best he tok to pray Bi adern sty; He di?t it, wiþ outen nay, And hom it brou?t an hei?e. A slepe ysonde lay, Tristrem him layd hir bi, Þe quen.

Sei?e þai neuer swiche man No non so fair a may Wiþ si?t; Bitven hem þer lay A drawen swerd wel bri?t. Þe huntes wenten ri?t And teld mark bi dene. Þe leuedi and þe kni?t Boþe mark haþ sene; He knewe hem wele bi si?t, Þe swerd lay hem bi tvene; A sonne bem ful bri?t Schon opon þe quen At a bore On her face so schene, And mark rewed þer fore. His gloue he put þer inne Þe sonne to were oway, Wreþe mark gan winne, Þan seyd he, “wel ay! ?if þai weren in sinne, Nou?t so þai no lay. Lo hou þai liue atvinne! Þai no hede nou?t of swiche play, Y wis.” Þe kni?tes seyden ay, “For trewe loue it is.” Þo waked tristrem þe trewe And swete ysonde þe schene Þe gloue o way þai drewe And seyden hem bi tvene; For markes þai it knewe, Þai wist he had þer bene. Þo was her ioie al newe, Þat he hem hadde y sene Wiþ si?t; Wiþ þat com kni?tes kene To feche þo to ful ri?t. To court were comen þo to Þat in þe forest were, Mark kist ysonde þo And tristrem trewe fere. For?euen hem was her wo, No were þai neuer so dere. Tristrem þe bailif gan to Swiftly for to stere A stounde. Of loue who wil lere, Listen now þe grounde. So bi fel bi dene Opon asomers day Tristrem and þe quen Stalked to her play. Þe duerwe hem haþ sene, To mark gan he say, “Sir king, wiþ outen wene, Þi wiif is now oway And þi kni?t: Wende fast as þou may, Of take hem, ?if þou mi?t.” Mark king after ran, Þat þai boþe y se. Tristrem seyd þan, “Ysonde, schent er we. For þou?tes þat we can For hole no may it be.” Nas neuer so sori man, Tristrem, þan was he, Þat hende: “For dout of deþ y fle, In sorwe and wo y wende. Y fle for dout of deþ, Y dar no leng abide In wo mi liif to lede Bi þis forestes side.” A ring ysonde him bede To tokening at þat tide. He flei?e forþ in gret drede In wode him for to hide Bidene; To seken him fast þai ride, Þai founden bot þe quene. Tristrem is went oway, As it nou?t hadde y bene; For þi þe kni?tes gan say Þat wrong markes had sen. For her þan prayd þai Þat mark for ?af þe quene. Tristrem wiþ ysonde lay Þat ni?t, wiþ outen wene, And wok And plaiden ay bitvene. His leue of hir he tok. Tristrem is went oway Wiþ outen coming o?ain, And sikeþ, for soþe to sain, Wiþ sorwe and michel pain. Tristrem fareþ ay As man þat wald be slain, Boþe ni?t and day, Fi?tes for to frain, Þat fre; Spaine he haþ þurch sayn, Geauntes he slou? þre, Out of spaine he rade Rohande sones to se, Gamen and ioie þai made, Welcom to hem was he; As lord he þer abade, As gode skil wald be. Þai boden him landes brade Þat he wan hem fre. He þou?t; He seyd, “þank haue ?e. ?our londes kepe y nou?t.” Into bretein he ches, Bi come þe doukes kni?t; He set his lond in pes, Þat arst was ful of fi?t. Al þat þe doukes wes He wan o?ain wiþ ri?t. He bede him, wiþ outen les, His douhter þat was bri?t In land. Þat maiden ysonde hi?t Wiþ þe white hand. Tristremes loue was strong On swete ysonde þe quene; Of ysonde he made a song, Þat song ysonde bi dene. Þe maiden wende al wrong Of hir it hadde y bene. Hir wening was so long, To hir fader hye gan mene For nede. Ysonde wiþ hand schene Tristrem to wiue þai bede. Tristrem a wil is inne, Has founden in his þou?t: “Mark, mi nem, haþ sinne, Wrong he haþ wrou?t; Icham in sorwe and pine, Þer to hye haþ me brou?t. Hir loue, y say, is mine, Þe boke seyt it is nou?t Wiþ ri?t.” Þe maiden more he sou?t, For sche ysonde hi?t. Þat in his hert he fand, And trewely þou?t he ay; Þe forward fast he band Wiþ ysonde, þat may Wiþ þe white hand, He spoused þat day. O ni?t, ich vnder stand, To boure wenten þai On bedde. Tristrem ring fel oway, As men to chaumber him ledde. Tristrem bi held þat ring, Þo was his hert ful wo: “O?ain me swiche aþing Dede neuer ysonde so; Mark, her lord, þe king, Wiþ tresoun may hir to. Mine hert may no man bring For no þing hir fro, Þat fre. Ich haue tvinned ous to, Þe wrong is al in me.” Tristrem to bedde ?ede Wiþ hert ful of care. He seyd, “þe dern dede, Do it y no dare.” Þe maiden he for bede, ?if it hir wille ware. Þe maide answerd in lede, “Þer of haue þou no care. Al stille Y nil desiri na mare Bot at þine owen wille.” Her fader on aday ?af hem londes wide Fer in þat cuntray Markes were set bi side. Bitvene þe douke þai had ben ay And a geaunt vn ride; No most þer no man play, Þat he no dede him abide And fi?t; Lesen he schuld his pride, Were he king or kni?t. “Tristrem, y þe for bede For þe loue of me, No hunte þou for no nede Bi?ond þe arm of þe se. Beliagog is vn rede, A stern geaunt is he; Of him þou owest to drede, Þou slou? his breþer þre In fi?t: Vrgan and morgan vn fre And moraunt, þe noble kni?t. ?if þine houndes an hare wele hayre And comen o?ain to þe fre, Al so be þou bonaire, When his houndes comen to þe.” Þe forest was wel faire Wiþ mani aselly tre. Tristrem þou?t repaire, Hou so it euer be, To bide: “Þat cuntre will y se, What auentour so bi tide.” Tristrem on huntinge rade, An hert chaci bigan; Þer þe merkes were made His houndes, ouer þai ran; Þe water was blalc and brade, Tristrem com as aman; Þer þe douke was fade Fast he folwed þan, Ri?t þare; He blewe priis as he can Þre mot oþer mare. Beliagog com þat tide And asked wat he is. “An hunting þer y ride, Tristrem ich hat, y wis.” “O! þou slou? moraunt wiþ pride. Tristrem artow þis?

Þis forest wil y felle And castel wil y ma; Her is miri to duelle, For þi þis lond y ta.” Þe geaunt herd þat spelle, For þi him was ful wa Vn wise. So bitven hem tva Þe cuntek gan arise. Dartes wel vn ride Beliagog set gan. Tristremes liif þat tide Ferly nei?e he wan. Bitvene þe hauberk and side Þe dart þurch out ran. Tristrem bleynt bi side, God he þonked þan Almi?t. Tristrem, as aman Fast he gan to fi?t. Beliagog þe bold, As afende he fau?t; Tristrem liif nei?e he sold, As tomas haþ ous tau?t; Tristrem smot, as god wold, His fot of at adrau?t; Adoun he fel y fold, Þat man of michel mau?t, And cride: “Tristrem, be we sau?t, And haue min londes wide. Ouer comen hastow me In bataile and in fi?t. Helden o?aines þe No wil y neuer wiþ ri?t.” His tresour lete he se Tristrem, þe noble kni?t. Tristrem knewe him fre; Beliagog in hi?t, Nou?t lain, An halle to maken him bri?t To ysonde and bringwain. Þe geaunt him gan lede Til he fond an hald; Þe water about ?ede, It was his eldren hald. Þe geaunt bad tristrem belde Wiþ masouns þat were bald. Beliagog in þat nede Fond him riche wald To fine: Ysonde haue þere he wald Luffsum vnder line. Þe geaunt him tau?t þat tide A ford þer it was ?are, Þere he mi?t wele ride When his wille ware. In þe hold he gan him hide, Seyd he nou?t he was þare; Nold he nou?t long abide, O?ain þo gan he fare, Þat fre. At þe castel forþer mare His werkmen wald he se. O?ain went tristrem þan, Beliagog had masouns sou?t. Tristrem, þat michel can, A werk hem haþ y brou?t; Nas þer neuer ?ete man Þat wist what oþer wrou?t; Arere when þai bi gan, Swiche awerk nas nou?t At nede; Þei al men hadde it þou?t, It nas to large no gnede. At his des in þe halle Swete ysonde was wrou?t; Hodain and pencru, to calle; Þe drink hou brengwain brou?t; Mark y clad in palle And meriadok ful of þou?t; — So liifliche weren þai alle Ymages semed it nou?t, To abide — And tristrem, hou he fau?t Wiþ beliagog vnride. So it bifel acas In seyn matheus toun Þat afair fest was Of lordes of renoun. A baroun, þat hi?t bonifas, Spoused aleuedi of lyoun. Þer was miche solas Of alle maner soun And gle Of minestrals vp and doun Bifor þe folk so fre. Þe riche douke florentin To þat fest gan fare, And his sone ganhardin, Wiþ hem rode ysonde þare. Her hors apolk stap in, Þe water her wat ay whare; It was a ferly gin, So heye vnder hir gare It flei?e. Þe leuedi lou? ful smare, And ganhardin it sei?e. Ganhardin, vn bliþe His soster þo cald he: “Abide now, dame, and liþe. What is þer tidde to þe? Do now telle me swiþe, Astow louest me, Whi lou? þou þat siþe. For what þing may it be? Wiþ outen oþ Þi frendschip schal y fle, Til y wite þat soþ.” “Broþer, no wraþe þe nou?t. Þe soþe y wil þe say. Mine hors þe water vp brou?t Of o polk in þe way. So hei?e it flei?e, me þou?t, Þat in mi sadel it lay. Þer neuer man no sou?t So nei?e, for soþe to say, In lede: Broþer, wite þou ay Þat y lou? for þat dede.” Quaþ ganhardin, “y finde Þat schamely schent ar we; To wiue on our kinde Heþeliche holdeþ he. Þer he gan treuþe binde, Fain y wald it se; For alle þe gold of ynde Ybroken no schal it be To bete. His frende schip wil y fle; Our on schal tine swete.” Wroþ is ganhardin And þat tristrem y ses; What þou?t he is in Fast he askeþ, y wis: “Þou hast bi ysonde lin, While þi wille is. Whi nas hye neuer þine? Tristrem, tel me þis In lede: What haþ hye don amis? What wites þou hir of dede?” “?if it hir wille ware, For hole it mi?t haue be; Sche haþ y told it ?ou ?are, Quite sche is of me. Of hir kepe y namare, A ?ift y ?eue þe. To a leuedi wil y fare, Is fairer þan swiche þre, To frain.” Ganhardin longeþ to se Þat leuedi, nau?t to lain. Ganhardin þe fest fles, He bi com tristremes frende; He seyd his liif he les, Bot he wiþ tristrem wende; Quaþ tristrem, “?if it so bes In inglond þat we lende, No say nou?t what þou ses, Bot hold, astow art hende And hele: Lay it al vnder hende, To steuen ?if þai it stele.” Ganhardin his treuþe pli?t, To ben his broþer he bede, To ben atrewe kni?t In al tristremes nede. Boþe busked þat ni?t To beliagog in lede. Ganhardin sei?e þat si?t And sore him gan adrede: “To brink To sle þou wilt me lede, To beliagog, me þink.” “Ganhardin, wrong haue þou alle. Wel, whi seistow so? Maugre on me falle ?if y þe wold slo! Þe geaunt is my þralle, His liif þei y wil to.” Tristrem þo gan him calle; On astilt he com þo Ful swiþe: “Lord, þi wille to do Þar to ar we blithe.” “Beliagog, go þare And loke it boun be; Ganhardin and y wil fare Þe leuedi for to se.” Swiche castel fond he þare, Was maked of ston and tre. Ganhardin wist nou are, Þer duelled tristrem and he, To liþe, Ysonde for to se In halle bri?t and bliþe. To ysonde bri?t so day To halle gun þai go; Ysonde þo sei?e þai And bringwain, boþe to, Tristrem, for soþe to say, And beliagog al blo. As ganhardin stert oway, His heued he brac þo, As he flei?e. Ganhardin was ful wo, Þat he com ysonde so nei?e. Ganhardin schamed sore, His heued ran on blod. Ysonde he sei?e þore And brengwain fair and gode. Brengwain þe coupe bore; Him rewe þat frely fode, He swore bi godes ore. In her hond fast it stode Al stille. “Tristrem, we ar wode To speken o?ain þi wille. Nis it bot hert breke, Þat swiþe wele finde we, And foly ous to speke Ani worde o?aines þe. Mi wille ?if y mi?t gete, Þat leuedi wold y se: Mine hert hye haþ y steke, Brengwain bri?t and fre, Þat frende; Bliþe no may ich be, Til y se þat hende.” Tristrem and ganhardin, Treuþe pli?ten þay, In wining and in tin Trewe to ben ay, In ioie and in pin, In al þing, to say, Til he wiþ brengwain haue lin, ?if þat tristrem may, In lede. To inglond þai toke þe way, Þo kni?tes stiþe on stede. Sir canados was þan Constable, þe quen ful nei?e; For tristrem ysonde wan, So weneþ he be ful slei?e To make hir his leman Wiþ broche and riche bei?e. For nou?t þat he do can Hir hert was euer hei?e To hold Þat man hye neuer sei?e Þat bifor tristrem wold. Tristrem made asong, Þat song ysonde þe slei?e And harped euer among; Sir canados was nei?e; He seyd, “dame, þou hast wrong, For soþe, who it sei?e. As oule and stormes strong, So criestow on heye In herd. Þou louest tristrem drei?e, To wrong þou art y lerd. Tristrem, for þi sake For soþe wiued haþ he. Þis wil þe torn to wrake: Of breteyne douke schal he be.

Bifore was stef on stede Tristrem and ganhardine. Ful ner þe gat þai abade Vnder afiger tre; Þai sei?e where ysonde rade And bringwain, boþe sei?e he Wiþ tvo houndes mirie made, Fairer mi?t non be. Her blis was ful brade, A tale told ysonde fre, Þai duelle. Tristrem þat herd he And seyd þus in his spelle: “Ganhardin, ride þou ay, Mi ring of finger þou drawe, Þou wende forþ in þi way And gret hem al on rawe; Her houndes praise þou ay, Þi finger forþ þou schawe. Þe quen, for soþe to say, Þe ring wil sone knawe, Þat fre. Aski sche wil in plawe, And say þou comest fro me.” Þo rode ganhardin kene And ouer takeþ hem now; First he greteþ þe quen And after brengwain, y trowe. Þe kni?t him self bi dene Stroked þe hounde pencru; Þe quen þe ring haþ sene And knewe it wele ynou?, Þat fre.

Þai wende þe quen wald dye, So sike sche was bi si?t. Þai sett pauilouns anheye And duelled, clerk and kni?t. Ysonde bi held þat lye Vndhr leues li?t; Tristrem hye þer sey?e, So dede brengwain þat ni?t In feld. Ganhardine treuþe pli?t Brengwain to wiue weld. Tvo ni?t þer þai lye In þat fair forest; Canados hadde a spie, Her pauilouns he tokest; Þer come to canados crie Þe cuntre est and west. Gouernayl was for þi Þer out, as it was best, To abide. He seyd tristrem prest, “Now it were time to ride.” Gouernayl, his man was he, And ganhardine his kni?t. Armed kni?tes þai se To felle hem doun in fi?t. Gouernaile gan to fle, He ran oway ful ri?t; Þo folwed bond and fre And lete þe loge vn li?t Þat tide. Oway rode tristrem þat ni?t And ganhardine biside. Sir canados þe hei?e, He ladde þe quen oway; Tristrem of loue so slei?e No abade him nou?t þat day. Brengwain bri?t so bei?e, Wo was hir þo ay; On canados sche gan crie And made gret deray And sede: “Þis lond nis worþ anay, When þou darst do swiche adede.” Ganhardine gan fare In to bretaine oway, And tristrem duelled þare To wite what men wald say; Coppe and claper he bare Til þe fiftenday, As he amesel ware; Vnder walles he lay, To liþe; So wo was ysonde, þat may, Þat alle sche wald to wriþe. Tristrem in sorwe lay, For þi wald ysonde awede, And brengwain þretned ay To take hem in her dede. Brengwain went oway, To marke, þe king, sche ?ede And redily gan to say Hou þai faren in lede: “Nou?t lain, Swiche kni?t hastow to fede, Þi schame he wald ful fain. Sir king, take hede þer to: Sir canados wil haue þi quen. Bot þou depart hem to, A schame þer worþ y sene. Hye dredeþ of him so, Þat wonder is to wene; His wille forto do Hye werneþ him bitvene Ful sone. ?ete þai ben al clene; Haue þai no dede y done.” Marke, in al þing Brengwain þanked he.

Tristrem in bour is bliþe, Wiþ ysonde playd he þare; Brengwain badde he liþe: “Who þer armes bare, Ganhardin and þou þat siþe Wi?tly oway gun fare.” Quaþ tristrem, “crieþ swiþe A turnament ful ?are Wiþ mi?t: Noiþer of ous nil spare Erl, baroun no kni?t.” A turnament þai lete crie, Þe parti canados tok he; And meriadok sikerly, In his help gan he be.

Bitvene canados and ganhardin Þe fi?t was ferly strong; Tristrem þou?t it pin Þat it last so long; His stiropo he made him tine, To grounde he him wrong.
