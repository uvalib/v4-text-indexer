WiÃ¾ tomas spak y Ã¾are; Ãer herd y rede in roune Who tristrem gat and bare, Who was king wiÃ¾ croun, And who him forsterd ?are, And who was bold baroun, As Ã¾air elders ware. Bi ?ere Tomas telles in toun Ãis auentours as Ã¾ai ware. Ãis semly somers day, In winter it is nou?t sen; Ãis greues wexen al gray, Ãat in her time were grene. So dos Ã¾is world, y say, Y wis and nou?t at wene, Ãe gode ben al oway Ãat our elders haue bene. (To abide) Of akni?t is Ã¾at y mene, His name, it sprong wel wide. Wald morgan Ã¾ole no wrong, Ãei morgan lord wes; He brak his castels strong, His bold borwes he ches, His men he slou? among And reped him mani ares. Ãe wer lasted so long Til morgan asked pes Ãurch pine. For soÃ¾e wiÃ¾ outen les, His liif he wende to tine.
