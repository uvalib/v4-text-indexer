A Riche soper there was dight; his name ganne he hele and hyde And sayd he was a strange knight. 19 Thanne had the erle sonnys two That were knightis makid newe; In þat tyme was the maner so, Whan yonge knightis shuld sheldis show, Tille þe friste yere were agoo, To bere Armys of one hewe, Rede or white, yelew or bloo; There-by men yonge knightis knew. 20 As they satte at there sopere, launcelot to the erle spake thare: “Sir, ys here Any Bachelere That to the turnament wolle fare?” “I haue two sonnys that me is dere, And now that oonne is seke full sare; So in companye þat he were myne other sonne I wold were thare.” 21 “Sir, and thy sonne wille thedir Right, The lenger I wolle hym abyde, And helpe hym there with all my myght That hym none harme shall be-tyde.” “Sir, the semys a noble kn[i]ght, Courteyse and hend, is not to hyde; At morow shall ye dyne and dight, Togedir I rede welle þat ye Ride.” 22 “Syr, of one thinge I wolle you mynne And be-seche you for to spede, yif here were Any Armure Inne, That I might borow it to this dede.” “Sir, my sonne lieth seke here-in; Take his Armure and his stede; For my sonnys men shall you kenne, Off Rede shall be your bothis wede.” 23 Therle had a doughter þat was hym dere, Mykell launcelott she beheld; hyr Rode was rede as blossom on brere Or floure þat springith in the feld; Glad she was to sitte hym nere, The noble knight vndir sheld; Wepinge was hyr moste chere, So mykell on hym hyr herte gan held. 24 Vp than Rose þat mayden stille And to hyr chamber wente she tho; Downe vppon hir bedde she felle, That nighe hyr herte brast in two. launcelot wiste what was hyr wyll, Welle he knew by other mo, hyr brother klepitte he hym tylle And to hyr chamber gonne they go; 25 he satte hym downe for the maydens sake vpon hyr bedde there she lay, Courtessely to hyr he spake, For to comforte þat fayre may; In hyr Armys she gan hym take And these wordis ganne she say: “Sir, bot yif that ye it make, Saff my lyff no leche may.” 26 “lady,” he sayd, “thou moste lette, For me ne giff the no-thynge Ille; In Another stede myne hert is sette, It is not at myne owne wille; In erthe is no thinge that shall me lette To be thy knight lowde and stille; A-nother tyme we may be mette Whan thou may better speke thy fille.” 27 “Sithe I of the ne may haue more, As thou arte hardy knight and fre, In the turnement þat thou wold bere Sum signe of myne þat men might se.” “lady, thy sleve thou shalte of-shere, I wolle it take for the love of the; So did I neuyr no ladyes ere Bot one that most hathe lovid me.” 28 On the morow whan it was day They dyned and made them yare, And þan they went forthe on there way To-gedyr as they bretherne were. They mette a squyer by the way That frome the turnament gan fare, And askyd yif he couthe them say Whiche party was the bygger thare. 29 “Sir Galehod hathe folke þe more, For sothe, lordingis, as I you telle, But Arthur is the bigger there; he hath knightis stiff and felle; They Ar bold and breme as bare, Evwayne and boert and lyonelle.” Therlys sonne to hym spake thare: “Sir, with them I rede we dwelle.” 30 launcelotte spake, as I you rede: “Sithe they ar men of grete valour, how might we amonge them spede There alle are stiffe &amp; stronge in stowre? helpe we them þat hath most nede; Ageyne the beste we shall welle dore; And we might there do Any dede, It wold vs torne to more honour.” 31 launcelot spekis in that tyde As knight þat was hardy and fre: “To-night with-oute I rede we byde; The presse is grete in the Cite.” “Sir, I haue An Aunte here beside, A lady of swith grete biaute; Were it your wille thedir to Ride, Glad of vs than wold she be.” 32 Tho to the castelle gonne they fare, To the lady fayre and bright; Blithe was the lady thare That they wold dwelle with hyr þat night; hastely was there soper yare Off mete and drinke rychely dight. Onne the morow gonne they dyne &amp; fare, Both launcelott and þat other knight. 33 Whan they come in-to þe feld, Myche there was of game &amp; play; A while they hovid &amp; by-held how Arthurs knightis Rode that day. Galehodis party by-gan to held, On fote his knightis ar lad away; launcelott stiff was vndyr sheld, Thinkis to helpe, yif that he may. 34 Be-syde hym come þan sir Evwayne, Breme as Any wilde bore; launcelott springis hym ageyne, In Rede armys þat he bare; A dynte he yaff with mekill mayne, Sir Evwayne was vn-horsid thare, That alle men wente he had bene slayne, So was he woundyd wondyr sare. 35 Sir boerte thoughte no-thinge good, Whan Sir Evwayne vn-horsid was; Forthe he springis as he were wode To launcelot, with-outen lees; launcelot hytte hym on the hode, The nexte way to ground he chese; Was none so stiff agayne hym stode, Fulle thynne he made the thikkest prees. 36 Sir lyonelle be-ganne to tene And hastely he made hym bowne, To launcelott with herte kene he rode with helme and swerd[e] browne; launcelott hitte hym, as I wene, Throughe the helme in-to þe Crowne, That euyr after it was sene; Bothe hors and man there yede adowne; 37 The knightis gadrid togedir thare And gan with Crafte there counselle take; Suche a knight was neuyr are But it were launcelot du lake; Bot, for the sleve on his Creste was thar, For launcelot wold they hym noght take; For he bare nevir none suche by-fore But it were for the quenys sake: 38 “Off Ascolot he neuyr was That thus welle beris hym to-day.” Ector sayd, with-outen lees, What he was he wold assay. A noble stede Ector hym chese And forthe rydis glad and gay; launcelot he mette a-mydde þe prese, By-twene them was no chi[l]dis play; 39 Ector smote with herte good To launcelot that ilke tyde; Throughe helme in-to his hede it yode That nighe loste he all his pride; launcelot hytte on the hood That his hors felle and he be-syde. launcelot blyndis in his blode, Oute of the feld full faste gan Ride; 40 Oute of the feld they Reden thoo To a forest highe and hore. Whan they come by them one two, Off his helme he takis thore. “Sir,” he sayd, “me is full woo, I drede that ye be hurte full sore.” “Nay,” he sayd, “it is not so, But fayne at Rest I wold we were.” 41 “Sir, myne Aunte is here be-syde, There we bothe were all nighte; Were it youre wille thedir to Ride, She wolle us helpe with all hyr might, And send for lechis this ylke tyde, youre woundis for to hele and dight; And I my-self wille with you abyde And be youre servante and youre knight.” 42 To the castelle they toke the way, To the lady fayre and hend; She sent for lechis, as I you say, That wonnyd bothe ferre and hend, But by the morow that it was day In bed he might hym-self not wend; So sore woundyd there he lay That well nighe had he sought his end. 43 Tho kinge arthur with mykell pride Callid his knightis all hym by And sayd a mounth he wold there byde And in wynchester lye; heraudis he dyd go and Ride Another turnamente for to Crye; “This knight wolle be here nere be-syde, for he is woundyd bitterlye.” 44 Whan the lettres made were The heraudis forth with them yede, Throughe yngland for to fare, Another turnament for to bede; Bad them buske and make them yare Alle that stiff were on stede. Thus these lettris sent were To tho that doughty were of dede, 45 Tille on a tyme þat it be-felle An heraude comys by the way And at the castelle a night gan dwelle There as launcelot woundyd lay, And of the turnamente gon telle That shuld come on the sonday. launcelot sighes wondyr stille And sayd: “allas and well-a-way! 46 Whan knightis wynne worship and pride, Som Auntre shall hold me a-way, As a coward for to a-byde.

There-of he ete a lytell wight, Off tresoun toke there no man hede; There he loste both mayne and might And died sone, as I you Rede. 108 They nyste what it myght by-mene, But vp hym sterte syr Gawayne, And sithen all the courte by-dene, And ouyr the bord they haue hym drayne. “Wellaway!” than sayd the quene, “Ihesu Criste! what may I sayne! Certis, now will all men wene My-self that I the knight haue slayne.” 109 Triacle there was anone forth brought, The quene wende to save his lyff, But all that myght helpe hym noght, For there the knight is dede as swithe; So grete sorow the quene than wrought, Grete doele it was to se and lythe; “lord, suche syttes me haue sought! Why ne may I nevir be blithe!” 110 Knyghtis done none other myght, Bot beryed hym with doele I-noughe, At a chapell with Riche lyghte, In a foreste by a cloughe; A Riche toumbe they dyd by dight, A Crafty clerke the lettres droughe, how there lay the shottysshe knyght That quene Genure with poyson slough. 111 Aftyr thys a tyme by-felle, To the courte ther come a knyght, his brodyr he was, as I you telle, And syr mador for sothe he highte; he was an hardy man and snelle, In turnamente and eke in fight, And mykell louyd in Courte to duelle, For he was man of myche myght. 112 Than it felle vppon a day, Sir mador wente with mekill pride In-to the foreste, hym for to play, That floured was and braunchid wyde; he found a chapell in his way, As he cam by a cloughis syde, There his owne brodyr lay, And there at masse he thought to abyde. 113 A Riche toumbe he found there dight With lettres that were fayre I-noughe; A while he stode and Redde it Right, Grete sorow than to his herte droughe, he found the name of the scottysshe knight That quene Genure with poysoun sloughe; There he loste bothe mayne and myght And ouyr the toumbe he felle in swoughe. 114 Off swownynge whan he myght awake, his herte was heuy as Any lede; he sighed for his brothers sake, he ne wiste what was beste Rede; The way to courte gan he take, Off no-thinge ne stode he drede; A lovde Crye on the quene gonne make In chalengynge of his brothers dede. 115 The kynge fulle sore than gan hym drede, For he myght not be ageyne the Right; The quene of witte wold nyghe wede; thoughe þat she agilte had no wight, She moste there by-know the dede, Or fynde a man for hyr to fight; For welle she wiste to deth she yede yif she were on a queste of knightis. 116 Thoughe Arthur were kynge þe land to weld, he myght not be agayne the Righte; A day he toke with spere and sheld To fynd a man for hyr to fight, That she shalle eyther to deth hyr yeld Or putte hyr on a queste of knightis; There-to bothe there handis vp-held And trewly there trouthis plighte. 117 Whan they in Certeyne had sette a day And that quarelle vndir-take, The word sprange sone throw eche contrey What sorow that quene genure ganne make; So at the laste, shortely to say, Word come to launcelot du lake, There as he seke I-woundyd lay; Men told hym holly all the wrake, 118 how that quene Genure the bright had slayne with grete treasoun A swithe noble scottishe knight At the mete with stronge poysoun; There-for a day was taken Right That she should fynd a knight full bowne For hyr sake for to fighte Or ellis be brente with-oute Raunsowne. 119 Whan þat launcelot du lake had herd holly all this fare, Grete sorow gon he to hym take, For the quene was in suche care, And swore to venge hyr of that wrake That day yif þat he lyvand ware; Than payned he hym his sorows to slake And wexe as breme as Any bare. 120 [N]ow leve we launcelot there he was, withe the ermyte in the forest grene, And telle we forthe of the case That touchith Arthur the kynge so kene. Sir Gawayne on the morne to conselle he tase And mornyd sore for the quene; In-to a toure than he hym has And ordeyned the beste there them by-twene; 121 And as they in there talkynge stode, To ordeyne how it beste myght be, A feyre Ryuer vndyr the toure yode, And sone there-in gonne they see A lytelle bote of shappe full good To theyme-ward with the streme gon te; There myght none feyrer sayle on flode Ne better forgid as of tree. 122 Whan kynge Arthur saw þat sighte, he wondrid of the Riche apparrayle That was aboute the bote I-dighte, So Richely was it coueryd sanzfayle, In maner of a voute with clothis I-dighte, Alle shynand as gold as yt ganne sayle.

Lette no man telle Syr gawayne, Gaheriet hys brother is dede hym fro, But weilaway! the reufulle Rayne, That euyr launcelote was my fo!” 249 Gawayne gonne in hys chambyr hym holde, Off All the day he nolde not oute goo; A squyer than the tythandys tolde What wondyr theighe hys herte were wo! “Allas!” he sayde, “my brother bolde, Where gahereit be dede me fro?” So sore hys hert be-gan to colde All-moste he wolde hym-selff sloo. 250 The squyer spake with drery mode, To re-comfort syr Gawayne: “Gaheriet eyles noght bot goode; he wolle sone come A-gayne.” Gawayne sprent as he were wode To the chambre there they lay slayne; The chambre flore Alle ranne on blode, And clothys of golde were ouer hem drayne. 251 A clothe he heuys than vppon hyght; What wondyr thoughe hys hert were sore So dulfully to se them dight That ere so doughty knyghtis were!

Thy faders wyffe, whether thou be wood, To wedd her now mayste thou noght. Come Arthur euyr ouer the flood, Thow mayste be bold, it wyll be boght.” 378 “A nyse clerke,” than mordred sayd, “Trowiste thow to warne me of my wille? be hym that for vs suffred payne, These wordys shalt thou lyke full ylle! with wilde hors thou shalt be drayne And hangyd hye vpon An hylle.” The bischoppe to fle than was fayne And suffred hym hys folyes to fulfylle; 379 Than he hym cursyd with boke And belle, At caunterbery, ferre in kente. Sone, whan mordred herd ther-of telle, To seche the bisschoppe hathe he sent; The bysshop durste no lenger dwelle But gold And syluer he hathe hent; There was no lenger for to spelle, But to A wyldernesse he is went; 380 The worldys wele ther he wyll for-sake, Off Ioye kepeth he neuer more, But A chapelle he lette make By-twene two hye holtys hore; There-in weryd he the clothys blake, In wode as he an ermyte ware; Often gan he wepe and wake For yngland that had suche sorowis sare. 381 Mordred had than lyen full longe, But the towre myght he neuer wynne, With strength ne with stoure stronge, ne with none other kynnes gynne; Hys fader dred he euyr A-monge, There-fore hys bale he nylle not blynne; He went to warne hem All with wronge The kyngdome that he was crownyd inne. 382 Forthe to dover þan gan he Ryde, All the costys wele he kende; To erlys And to barons on ylk A syde Grete yiftis he gaffe And lettres send, And for-sette the see on ylke A syde With bold men And bowes bente; Fro yngland, that is brode And wyde, hys owne fader he wold deffend. 383 Arthur, that was mykelle of myght, With hys folke come over the flode, An C galeyse that were welle dyght With barons bold And hye of blode; he wende to haue landyd, as it was Ryght, At Dower, ther hym thoght full gode, And ther he fande many An hardy knyght That styffe in stoure A-gaynste hym stode. 384 Arthur sone hathe take the land That hym was leveste in to lende; hys fele fomen that he ther found, he wende by-fore had bene hys frend. The kynge was wrothe And weliney wode, And with hys men he gan vp wend; So strong A stoure was vpon that stronde That many A man ther had hys end. 385 Syr gawayne armyd hym in that stounde; Allas! to longe hys hede was bare; he was seke And sore vnsond; hys woundis greuyd hym full sare; One hytte hym vpon the olde wounde With A tronchon of An ore; There is good gawayne gone to grounde, That speche spake he neuyr more. 386 Bold men, with bowes bentte, Boldely vp in botes yode, And Ryche hauberkis they Ryve and Rente, that Throw-owte braste the Rede blode; Grounden gleyves throw hem wente; Tho games thoght theym nothynge gode; But by that strong stoure was stente, The stronge stremys Ran All on blode. 387 Arthur was so moche of myght, Was ther none that hym with-stode; He hewyd vppon ther helmes bryght, That throw ther brestes Ran the blode; By than that endyd was the fight, The false were feld, som wer fledde To canterbery All that nyght, To warne ther master, syr mordred. 388 Mordred than made hym bowne And boldely he wylle batayle A-byde, With helme, scheld, And hauberke browne; So All hys Rowte gan forthe Ryde; They hem mette vppon barendowne, Full erly in the morowe tyde; With gleyves grete And gonfanowne Grymly they gan to-gedyr Ryde; 389 Arthur was of Ryche A-Raye And hornys blew lowde on hyght, And mordred comyth glad and gay, As traytour that was false in fyght. Thay faught All that longe day Tyll the nyght was nyghed nyghe; Who had it sene wele myght saye That suche A stoure neuer he syghe. 390 Arthur than faught with hert good— A nobler knyght was neuer noon; Throw helmes in-to hede yt yoode And steryd knyghtis bothe blode And bone. mordred for wrathe was nye wode, Callyd hys folke And sayd to hem One: “Releve yow, for crosse on Rode! Alas! thys day so sone is goone!” 391 Fele men lyeth on bankys bare With bryght brondys throw-owte borne; Many A doughty man dede was thar, And many A lord hys lyfe hathe lorne; mordred was full of sorowe And care; At canterbery was he vpon the morne; And Arthur All nyght he dwellyd thare, Hye frely folke lay hym by-forne. 392 Erely on the morow tyde Arthur bad hys hornys blowe, And callyd folke on euery syde, And many A dede beryed on A rowe, In pittes that was depe And wyde; On Iche An hepe they layd hem lowe, So All that ouer gone And Ryde Som by there markys men myght knowe. 393 Arthur went to hys dyner thane— hys frely folke hym folowed faste— But whan he fand syr gawayne In A shyppe laye dede by A maste, Or euyr he coveryd myght or mayne, An C tymes hys hert nyghe braste. 394 Thay layd syr gawayne vpon A bere And to the castell they hym bare, And in A chapell A-mydde the quere That bold baron they beryed thare. Arthur than changyd All hys chere; What wondyr thoghe hys hert was sare! hys suster sone, that was hym dere, Off hym shold he here neuyr mare. 395 Syr Arthur, he wolde no lenger A-byde; Than had he All maner of euyll Reste; He sought aye forthe the southe syde And toward walys wente he weste; At salusbury he thought to byde, At that tyme he thought was beste, And calle to hym by Whytesontyde Barons bold to batayle preste. 396 Vnto hym came many A doughty knyght, For wyde in worlde theyse wordys sprange, That syr Arthur hade All the Ryght, And mordred warred on hym with wronge. Hydowse it was to se with syght, Arthur-is oste was brode And longe, And mordred that was mykell of myght With grete gyftes made hym stronge. 397 Sone After the feste of the trynyte Was A batayle by-twene hem sette, That A sterne batayle ther shuld be; For no lede wold they it lette; And syr Arthur makethe game And glee For myrth that they shuld be mette; And syr mordred can to the contre, With fele folke that ferre was fette. 398 At nyght whan Arthur was brought in bedd— He shuld haue batayle vppon the morow— In stronge sweu[en]ys he was by-stedde, That many A man that day shuld haue sorow; hym thowht he satte in gold All gledde, As he was comely kynge with crowne, vpon A whele that full wyde spredd, And All hys knyghtis to hym bowne. 399 The whele was ferly Ryche And Rownd, In world was neuyr none halfe so hye; There-on he satte Rychely crownyd With many A besaunte broche And be; he lokyd downe vpon the grownd, A blake water ther vndyr hym he see, With dragons fele there lay vn-bownde, That no man durst hem nyghe nyee. 400 he was wondyr ferd to falle A-monge the fendys ther that faught; The whele ouer-tornyd ther with-All And eueryche by A lymme hym caught. The kynge gan lowde crye And calle, As marred man of wytte vn-saught; hys chambyrlayns wakyd hym ther with-All And woodely oute of hys slepe he raught. 401 All nyght gan he wake And wepe, With drery hert And sorowfull stevyn, And A-gaynste day he felle on slepe; A-boute hym was sette tapers sevyn; Hym thought Syr gawayne hym dyd kepe With mo folke þan men can nevyn, By A Ryuer that was brode And depe; All semyd Angellys cam from heuyn. 402 The kynge was neuyr yit so fayne, hys soster sone whan that he sye; “Welcome,” he sayd, “syr gawayne; And thou myght leue, welle were me. Now, leue frend, with-outen layne, What Ar tho folke that folow the?” “Sertis, syr,” he sayd A-gayne, “They byde in blysse ther I motte be. 403 lordys they were And ladyes hende, Thys worldys lyffe that hanne for-lorne; Whyle I was man on lyffe to lende, A-gaynste her fone I faught hem forne; now fynde I them my moste Frende: They blysse the tyme that I was borne; They Asked leve with me to wende To mete with yow vpon thys morne. 404 A monthe day of trewse moste ye take And than to batayle be ye bayne; yow comethe to helpe lancelot du lake, With many A man mykell of mayne: To-morne the batayle ye moste for-sake Or ellys, certis, ye shall be slayne.” The kynge gan woffully wepe and wake, And sayd: “Allas! thys Rewffull Rayne!” 405 hastely hys clothys on hym he dyde, And to hys lordys gan he saye: “In stronge sweyneys I haue bene stad, That glad I may not for no gamys gaye. We muste vnto syr mordred sende And founde to take An-other day, Or trewly thys day I mon be shende, Thys know I in bed as I laye. 406 Goo thow, syr lucan de boteler, That wyse wordys haste in wolde, And loke that thou take with the here Bysshopys fele and barons bolde.” Forthe went they All in fere, in trew bokys as it is tolde, To syr mordred and hys lordis there they were, And an C knyghtis All vn-tolde. 407 The knyghtis that ware of grete valoure, By-fore syr mordred as they stode, They gretyn hym with grete honowre, As barons bold And hye of blode: “Ryght wele the gretys kynge Arthur, And praythe the with mylde mode, A monethe day to stynte thys stoure, For hys loue that dyed on Rode.” 408 mordred, that was bothe kene And bolde, made hym breme As Any bore at bay, And sware by Iudas that Ihesus sold: “Suche sawes Ar not now to saye; That he hathe hyght he shall it hold; The tone of vs shall dye thys day; And telle hym trewly that I tolde, I schall hym marre, yife that I may.” 409 “Syr, thay sayd, with-owten lese, Thow? thou And he to batayle bowne, many A ryche shall rewe that reasse, By All by dalte vpon thys downe; yit were it better for to sease, And lette [hym] be kynge and bere the crowne; And after hys dayes, full dredelesse, ye to welde All yngland, towre And towne.” 410 mordred tho stode stylle A whyle, And wrothely vp hys eyne there wente, And sayd: “wyste I it were hys wylle To yeue me cornwale And kente, lette vs mete vpon yonder hylle And talke to-gedyr with gode entente; Suche forwardys to full-fylle, There-to shall I me sone Assent. 411 And yiffe we may with spechys spede, With trew trowthes of entayle, hold the bode-worde that we bede, To yeue me kente And cornwayle, Trew loue shall ther lenge And lende; And, sertis, forwardys yif we fayle, Aythur to sterte vppon A stede, styffely for to do batayle.” 412 “Sur, wyll ye come in suche maner, With xij knyghtis or fourtene, Or ellys All your strenghe in fere, With helmes bryght And hauberkys shene?” “Se[r]tys, nay,” than sayd he thore, “Othur warke thou thare not wene, But bothe oure hoostis shall nyghe nere And we shalle talke them by-twene.” 413 They toke ther leue, with-owten lese, And wyghtely vpon there way wente; To kynge Arthur the way they chese, there that he satte with-in hys tente. “Syr, we haue proferyd pease, Yiffe ye wille ther-to Assente: Gyffe hym the crowne After your dayes And in yower lyffe cornwayle and kente; 414 To hys by-heste yiffe ye will holde, And your trouthe trewly ther-to plyght, maketh All redy your men bolde, With helme, swerd And hauberke bryght; ye schall mete vppon yone molde That ayther oste may se with syght; And yiff your foreward fayle to holde, There is no bote but for to fyght.” 415 But whan Arthur herd thys nevyn, Trewly ther-to he hathe sworne, And Arayed hym with batayles seuyn, With brode baners by-fore hym borne; They lemyd lyght As Any leuyn Whan they shold mete vpon the morne. There lyves no man vndyr heuyn A feyrer syght hath sene by-forne. 416 But mordred many men had mo; So mordred that was mykell of mayne, he had euyr xij A-gaynste hym two Off barons bold to batayle bayne. Arthur And mordred—bothe were thro— Shuld mete bothe vpon A playne; The wyse shuld come to And fro To make A-cord, the sothe to sayne. 417 Arthur in hys herte hathe Caste And to hys lordis gan he saye: “To yonder traytour haue I no truste But that he woll vs falselly be-traye, yiff we may not oure forwardys faste. And ye se any wepyn drayne, presythe forthe As princes praste, That he &amp; All hys hoste be slayne.” 418 mordred, that was kene And thro, hys frely folke he sayd to-forne: “I wote that Arthur is full woo That he hathe thus hys landys lorne; With fourtene knyghtis And no mo shall we mete at yondyr thorne; yiff Any treason by-twene vs go, That brode baners forth be borne.” 419 Arthur with knyghtis fully xiiij, To that thorne on fote they fonde, With helme, sheld, And hauberke shene; Ryght so they trotted vppon þe grownde. But As they A-cordyd shulde haue bene, An Edder glode forth vpon the grownde; he stange A knyght, that men myght sene That he was seke And full vn-sownde. 420 Owte he brayed with a swerd bryght; To kylle the Adder had he thogh[t]e; Whan Arthur party saw that syght, Frely they to-gedyr sought; There was no-thynge with-stande theym myght; They wend that treson had bene wroghte. That day dyed many A doughty knyght, And many A bolde man was broght to noght. 421 Arthur stert vpon hys stede; he saw no thyng hym with-stand myght; mordred owte of wytte nere yede, And wrothely in-to hys sadyll he lyght; Off A-corde was no-thyng to bede, But fewtred sperys and to-geder sprente; Full many A doughty man of dede Sone there was leyde vpon the bente. 422 mordred I-maryd many A man, And boldely he gan hys batayle abyde; So sternely oute hys stede Ranne, many A rowte he gan throw Ryde; Arthur of batayle neuyr blanne To dele woundys wykke and wyde; Fro the morow that it by-ganne Tylle it was nere the nyghtis tyde, 423 There was many A spere spente, And many A thro word they spake; many A bronde was bowyd and bente And many A knyghtis helme they brake; Ryche helmes they Roffe and rente; The Ryche rowtes gan to-gedyr Rayke, An C thousand vpon the bente; The boldest or evyn was made Ryght meke. 424 Sythe bretayne owte of troy was sought And made in bretayne hys owne wonne, Suche wondrys neuyr ere was wroght, Neuyr yit vnder the sonne; By evyn leuyd was there noght That euyr steryd with blode or bone But Arthur and ij that he thedyr broghte, And mordred was levyd there Alone. 425 The tone was lucan de botelere, That bled at many A bale-full wound, And hys brodyr, syr bedwere, Was sely seke and sore vnsounde. Than spake Arthur these wordys there: “Shall we not brynge thys theffe to ground?” A spere he gryped with fell chere, And felly they gan to-gedyr found. 426 he hytte mordred amydde the breste And oute At the bakke bone hym bare; There hathe mordred hys lyffe loste, That speche spake he neuyr mare; But kenely vp hys Arme he caste And yaff Arthur A wound sare, In-to the hede throw the helme And creste, That iij tymes he swownyd thare. 427 Syr lucan And syr Bedwere By-twene theym two the kynge vp-held; So forthe went tho iij in fere, And All were slayne that lay in feld. The doughty kynge that was hem dere, For sore myght not hym-self weld; To A chapelle they went in fere— Off bote they saw no better beld. 428 All nyght thay in the chapelle laye, Be the see syde, As I yow newyn, To mary mercy cryand aye, With drery herte and sorowfull stevyn; And to hyr leue sonne gan they pray: “Ihesu, for thy namys sevyn, Wis hys sowle the Ryght way, That he lese not the blysse of heuyn.” 429 As syr lucan de boleter stode, he sey folk vppon playnes hye; Bold barons of bone and blode, They Refte theym besaunt, broche, and bee; And to the kynge Agayne thay yode, Hym to warne with wordys slee; 430 To the kynge spake he full styll, Rewffully as he myght than Rowne: “Sir, I haue bene At yone hylle, There fele folke drawen to the downe; I note whedyr they wyll vs good or ylle, I rede we buske And make vs bowne, yiff it be your worthy wylle, That we wende to som towne.” 431 “Now, syr lucan, As thow Radde, lyfte me vp, whyle that I may laste.” Bothe hys Armes on hym he sprad With All hys strengh to hold hym faste. The kynge was wondyd and for-bled And swownyng on hym hys eyne he caste; Syr lucan was hard by-stadde; He held the kynge to hys owne herte braste. 432 Whan the kynge had swounyd there, By an Auter vp he stode; Syr lucan, that was hym dere, Lay dede and fomyd in the blode. Hys bold brothyr, Sir Bedwere, Full mykell mornyd in hys mode; For sorow he my?te not nyghe hym nere, But euyr wepyd As he were wode. 433 The kynge tornyd hym there he stode, To syr Bedwere with wordys kene: “Have Excalaber, my swerd[e] good; A better brond was neuyr sene; Go, Caste it in the salt flode And thou shalt se wonder, as I wene. hye the faste, for crosse on Rode, And telle me what thou haste ther sene.” 434 The knyght was both hende and free, To save that swerd he was full glad, And thought “whethyr I better bee, yif neuyr man it After had; And I it caste in-to the see, Off mold was neuyr man so mad.” The swerd he hyd vndyr A tree, And sayd: “syr, I ded as ye me bad.” 435 “What saw thow there?” than sayd the kynge, “Telle me now, yif thow can.” “Sertes, syr,” he sayd, “nothynge But watres depe And wawes wanne.” “A! now thou haste broke my byddynge! Why haste thou do so, thow false man? A-nother bode thou muste me brynge.” Thanne careffully the knyght forthe Ranne 436 And thought the swerd yit he wold hyde, And keste the scauberke in the flode. “yif Any Aventurs shall be-tyde, There-by shall I se tokenys good.” In-to the see he lette the scauberke glyde; A whyle on the land hee there stode, Than to the kynge he wente that tyde, And sayd: “syr, it is done, by the Rode.” 437 “Saw thou Any wondres more?” “Sertys, syr, I saw nought.” “A! false traytor,” he sayd thore, “Twyse thou haste me treson wroght; That shall thou rew sely sore; And, be thou bold, it shal be bought.” The knyght than cryed: “lord, thyn ore!” And to the swerd sone he sought. 438 Syr bedwere saw that bote was beste, And to the good swerd he wente; In-to the see he hyt keste; Than myght he se what that it mente. There cam An hand with-outen Reste Oute of the water And feyre it hente, And brandysshyd As it shuld braste, And sythe, as gleme, A-way it glente. 439 To the kynge A-gayne wente he thare, And sayd: “leve syr, I saw An hand; Oute of the water it cam All bare, And thryse brandysshyd that Ryche brande.” “helpe me sone that I ware there.” he lede hys lord vnto that stronde; A ryche shyppe, with maste And ore, Full of ladyes, there they fonde. 440 The ladyes, that were feyre and free, Curteysly the kynge gan they fonge, And one that bryghtest was of blee wepyd sore and handys wrange. “Broder,” she sayd, “wo ys me! Fro lechyng hastow be to longe. I wote that gretely greuyth me, For thy paynes Ar full stronge.” 441 The knyght kest A rewfull rowne, There he stode, sore and vnsownde, And say[de]: “lord, whedyr Ar ye bowne? Allas! whedyr wyll ye fro me fownde?” The kynge spake with A sory sowne: “I wylle wende a lytell stownde In-to the vale of Avelovne, A whyle to hele me of my wounde.” 442 Whan the shyppe from the land was broght, Syr bed were saw of hem no more; Throw the forest forthe he soughte, On hyllys and holtys hore. Of hys lyffe Rought he Ryght noght, All nyght he went wepynge sore; A-gaynste the day he fownde ther wrought A chapelle by-twene ij holtes hore. 443 To the chapell he toke the way; There myght he se A woundyr syght; Than saw he where an ermyte laye By-fore A tombe that new was dyghte; And coveryd it was with marboll graye And with Ryche lettres Rayled Aryght; There-on An herse, sothely to saye, With an C tappers lyghte. 444 vnto the ermyte wente he thare And Askyd who was beryed there. The ermyte Answeryd swythe yare: “There-of can I tell no more. A-bowte mydnyght were ladyes here, In world ne wyste I what they were; Thys body they broght vppon a bere And beryed it with woundys sore; 445 Besavntis offred they here bryght, I hope an C povnd and more, And bad me pray bothe day and nyght For hym that is buryed in these moldys hore Vnto ower lady bothe day And nyght, That she hys sowle helpe sholde.” The knyght redde the lettres A-ryght; For sorow he fell vn-to the folde. 446 “Ermyte,” he sayd, “with-oute lesynge, here lyeth my lord that I haue lorne, Bold arthur, the beste kynge That euyr was in bretayne borne. yif me som of thy clothynge, For hym that bare the crowne of thorne, And leue that I may with the lenge, Whyle I may leve, And pray hym forne.” 447 The holy ermyte wold not wounde— Some tyme Archebishop he was, That mordred flemyd oute of londe, And in the wode hys wonnyng chase— he thankyd Ihesu All of his sound That syr bed were was comyn in pease; he resayved hym with herte And honde, To-gedyr to dwelle, with-outen lese. 448 Whan quene Gaynor, the kynges wyffe, Wyste that All was gone to wrake, A-way she went with ladys fyve To Avmysbery, A nonne hyr for to make. Ther-in she lyved An holy lyffe, In prayers for to wepe And wake; neuyr After she cowde be blythe; There weryd she clothys whyte And blake. 449 Whan thys tydyngis was to launcelot broght, What wondyr thowgh hys hert were sore! hys men, hys frendys, to hym sought And All the wyse that with hym were. her gallayes were All Redy wroght, They buskyd theyme And made yare; To helpe Arthur was ther thoght And make mordred of blysse full bare. 450 lancelot had crownyd kyngis sevyn, Erlys fele And barons bold; The nombyr of knyghtis I can not nevyn, The squyres to fele to be told; They lemyd lyght as Any levyn The wynde was as hem-self wold, Throw the grace of god of hevyn; At douer they toke hauyn And hold; 451 There herd telle lancelot in that towne, In lond it is not for to layne, how they had faught at barendowne, And how beryed was syr gawayne, And how mordred wold be kynge with crowne, And how ayther of theym had other slayn, And All that were to batayle bowne At salysbery lay dede vpon the playne; 452 Also in londe herd hyt kythe, That made hys hert wonder sare, quene Gaynour, the kyngis wyffe, Myche had levyd in sorow and care; A-way she went with ladyes fyve, In lond they wyste not whedyr whar, Dolwyn dede or to be on lyve; That made hys mornyng moche the mare. 453 lancelot clepid hys kyngis with crowne, Syr bors stode hym nere be-syde; he sayd: “lordyngis, I wyll wend to-forne, And by these bankys ye shall A-byde Vnto fyftene dayes at the morne.

Than bors of wepyng had neuyr hys fylle; To bedde they yede than All by-dene. 486 A lytell whyle by-fore the day, As the bysshop lay in hys bed, A laughter toke hym there he laye, That All they were Ryght sore A-dred. They wakenyd hym, for sothe to saye, And Askyd yif he were hard by-sted. he sayd: “Allas And wele A-way!

Ihesu that crownyd was with thorne, In heuyn hys soule foster and fede!” Vnto the fyfty day at the morne They lefte not for to synge And Rede, 490 And After they made theym A bere, The bysshop and these other bold, And forthe they wente, All in fere To Ioyes garde, that Ryche hold. In A chapell a-myddys the quere A graue they made as thay wold, And iij dayes they wakyd hym there, In the castell with carys cold. 491 Ryght as they stode A-boute the bere And to bereynge hym shold haue browght, In cam syr Ector, hys brodyr dere, That vij yere A-fore had hym sought. he lokyd vp in-to the quere; To here A masse than had he thought; For that they All Ravysshyd were, They knew hym and he hem nought. 492 Syr bors bothe wepte And songe, Whan they that feyre faste vnfold; There was none but hys handys wrange, The bysshop nor none of the other bold. Syr Ector than thought longe; What thys corps was feyne wete he wolde; An C tymes hys herte nye sprange, By that bors had hym the tale tolde. 493 Full hendely syr bors to hym spakke And sayd: “welcome, syr Ector, I-wysse; here lyethe my lord lancelot du lake, for whome that we haue mornyd thus.” Than In Armys they gan hym take, The dede body to clyppe And kysse, And prayed All nyght he myght hym wake, For Ihesu love, kynge of blysse. 494 Syr Ector of hys wytte nere wente, Walowed and wronge as he were wode; So wofully hys mone he mente, hys sorow myngyd All hys mode; Whan the corps in Armys he hente, The terys owte of hys yen yode; At the laste they myght no lenger stent, But beryed hym with drery mode. 495 Sythen on there knees they knelyd downe— Grete sorow it was to se with syght— “Vnto Ihesu cryste Aske I A boone, And to hys moder, mary bryght. lord, As thow madyste bothe sonne and mone, And god And man arte moste of myght, Brynge thys sowle vnto thy trone, And euyr thow Rewdyste on gentyll knyght.” 496 Syr Ector tent not to hys stede, Whedyr he wold stynt or Renne Away, But with theym to dwelle and lede, For lancelot All hys lyffe to pray. On hym dyd he armytes wede, And to hyr chapell went hyr way; A fourtenyght on fote they yede, Or they home come, for sothe to say. 497 Whan they came to Avmysbery, Dede they faunde Gaynour the quene, With Roddys feyre and Rede as chery; And forthe they bare hyr theym by-twene, And beryed hyr with masse full merry By syr Arthur, as I yow mene. Now hyght there chapell glassynbery, An Abbay full Ryche, of order clene. 498 Off lancelot du lake telle I no more, But thus by-leve these ermytes sevyn; And yit is Arthur beryed thore, And quene Gaynour, as I yow nevyn; With monkes that ar Ryght of lore. They Rede and synge with mylde stevyn: “Ihesu, that suffred woundes sore, Graunt vs All the blysse of hevyn!” Amen.</field>
