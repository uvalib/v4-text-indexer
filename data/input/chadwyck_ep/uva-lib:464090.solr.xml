      <field name="fulltext">Nunc levior cippus non imprimit ossa! Laudat posteritas, nunc non é manibus illis Nunc non é tumulo fortunaque favilla Nascuntur viola ’. Pers: Sat: 1. 3.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot. Prov. 10. 7. The Life and Death of Berengarius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Most worthily may this Divine Old Berengarius, fairely shine Within this Skie of lustrious Starres, Who, 'gainst Romes errours fought Truths warres; Confuting, with high approbation, Romes sigment, Transubstantiation; Which did that Hierarchie so vex, And with such passion so perplex, That they would never give him rest, But did his Soule so much molest, That at the last, by fraud and force, They made him (with most sad remorse) Two severall times his Cause recant. Him of his Crown, thus, to supplant. Thus, O, thus, oft, Sols raye most rare, With duskie clouds ecclipsed are. The Life and Deth of John Wicklief.The attribution of this poem is questionable. With our old English writers rare, John Wicklief, justly might Compare; For Learning, Life, and solid Witt, And many Works he rarely Writt; Contending stoutly, 'gainst Romes Errours, Nere daunted by their threats or terrours; But, to his death, still, fought faiths fight, And thus went out this Lamp of Light. But, being dead, Rome did so rave, 'Gainst this Faiths Champion, that from 's grave, They digged-up his Bones, with ire, And burnt (as Hereticks) in fire. Thus was Romes Folly, Rage, exprest, To burn dead Bones, of Soules, at rest. The Life and Death of John Huss.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This most illustrious Lamp of Gospel Light, Which in Bohemia, first, shon forth most bright, By this renowned Martyres industrie, Heavenly heroick Huss; yet, furiously, Affronted was by Papall enemies. But, in the midst of this their rage, did rise, Among themselves, a mighty Schisme and rent; Three Anti-Popes, at Once; by which event, Renowned Huss did great advantage gain, The Gospels Light to propagate, maintain. But, at the last, that Schisme being sew'd-up, Againe, they fill their wraths and rages Cup; And gave it Huss to drink, who, valiantly, Drank-up the same, to deaths extremity; And, though, they Painted-Devils plac'd on his head, Yet, he their rage and scorn did nothing dread. Thus, faithlesse Rome breaking her promise given In firey-Chariot sent his Soul to Heaven. The life and Death of Jerom of Prague.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This brave Bohemian worthy may, indeed, His brother Huss most worthily succeed; And, as two Twins, for their heroick Spirit, The one, the others honour may inherit. For, by John Huss, Jerom was blestly ayded, Where by the Romish-rout he was invaded; And, Jerom, hearing Huss was wrong'd by Rome, To vindicate his quarrell, did presume. But, in the tryall, found his heeles tript up. Fearfull (by Romish rage) to taste his Cup; Yet, at the last, that tempting blast ore blown, His doubled and redoubled Zeal was shown: Stoutly recanting his forc'd recantation, To th'Death he hated Romes abomination. Which did their Romish furie so enflame, That, torturing him, they Tygers fierce became; His head (like Huss) with painted Divels, arrayd, His Soule to Heaven, outragious flames convayd. The Life and Death of Luther. [Eate what is sodden well]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Eate what is sodden well; Drinke what is pure and cleare: That thou the truth doth tell, To all let it appeare. Speake not to all, what ever thou doest know: If thou be well, keepe wisely were thou art: Conserve with care, what ever is thine owne, Mischance sure footed comes like th'nimbling Hart. Be silent in due time, abstaine, sustaine, Hold up thy head. Of need to none complaine; Dispaire not of Gods helpe, thy state to stay, Who sends assistance to us every day. [Here, in this Vrne doth Martin Luther rest]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Here, in this Vrne doth Martin Luther rest, And sweetly sleep in hope to rise most blest. By whose rare pains, firme faith and Christs free Grace, Which formerly thick Fogs of Error base, And Duskie Clouds of Works desert hid quite, Were well reduced to their ancient Light. For, when blind Superstition ruled All, And did fair Truth, long time, suppresse and thrall; He, by Gods Word and Spirits inspiration, The Gospels Light re-spred, for every Nation. And well-instructed by Pauls sacred voyce, (Scorning Romes Cheats,) to teach pure Truth, made choyce. And as John Baptist in the Wildernesse, Did Gods Lamp, who heals Sin Preach and expresse: So (O Sweet Christ) did Luther cleare thy booke, When all the World was caught with Errors booke. And what the difference was betwixt the Law (Whose tables Moses brake, though God he saw Vpon Mount-Sinai) and the Gospell sweet, Which heales Sin-conscious hearts, which Gods wrath meet, This difference lost to th'World he did restore, That so Christs gifts of Grace might shine the more; He stoutly did oppose Romes Cheats and Charmes, And Papall rule, which wrought Gods Saints great harmes. Exhorting all, Romes idols for to flye, He many souls wan to true piety. And, mauger all Romes threats and snares most slie, Finisht in Faith, his Course most valiantly. Dying in peace, his Soule with Christ doth rest, Crown'd with immortall Glory, truely blest. For which rare Doctor, let both high and low Blesse God, that they so clear Christs truth doe know. And pray the Lord that these his Gospels rayes May to the World shine-forth for datelesse dayes. [Dead is grave Luther, worthy all due praise] Dead is grave Luther, worthy all due praise, Who set forth Christ, in Faiths illustrious rayes. His Death the Church laments, with sighs sincere, Who was her Pastour, nay, her Patron deare, Our Israels Chariots and Horsemen rare; Is dead, with me let All sad Sables weare; Let them their griefe in groaning verses sing, For such sad Knells, such Orphans best may ring. Philip Melancthon. [Rome tam'd the World, the Pope tam'd Rome, so great] Rome tam'd the World, the Pope tam'd Rome, so great; Rome rul'd by power, the Pope by deep Deceit. But, how more large, than theirs, was Luthers Fame, Who, with One Pen, both Pope and Rome doth tame? Goe, fictious Greece, goe tell Alcides, then, His Club is nothing to great Luthers Pen. Theodore Beza. [By Luthers labours Leo the tenth is slaine] By Luthers labours Leo the tenth is slaine; Not Hercles Club, but Luthers Pen's his bane. John Major. [When Luther dy'd, then with him dy'd most sure] When Luther dy'd, then with him dy'd most sure A Crown, and credit of Religion pure. His Soul soar'd up to heaven, on Concords day, Which tended Luther thither, on his way: Deare Christ, since Discord followed with Coats rent, Give to thy Spouse Elijahs ornament. Joachim a Beust. [Welfare those gentle Quils (whose ere they be)]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Welfare those gentle Quils (whose ere they be) Whose meritorious labours shall set free The Urne imprisoned Dust of that renown'd Thrice famous Luther: Let his head be crown'd With sacred Immortality, and rais'd Much rather to be wondred at then prais'd. Let Babes unborn, like fruitfull plants bring forth To after dayes new Monuments of his worth, And time-out lasting Name: that Babels Whore And all his bald-pate panders may ev'n rore For very anguish, and then gnaw and bite Their tongues for malice, and their nailes for spite; Whilst men made perfect in his well know story May all turne Patrons, and protect his Glory. The Life and Death of Erasmus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This famous and renowned Writer, Erasmus, Author and Inditer Of many learned Workes of Worth, Which, in his life time he set forth; Was (for his Learning) and rare Parts; His Wit, his Wisedome, skill in Arts And Languages, and Uertues rare, Wherein, he justly might compare With his Contemporaries best, In such esteeme and high request, With all the Princes, Potentates, And learned Clerkes of all the States In Christendome, which knew or saw him; That they contended who should draw him To live with them, Him to enjoy, And with them, his rare Parts t'employ: Sending him many Gifts most great, His presence with them to entreat. But, crown'd (at last) with honours Bayes, In Basil He did end his dayes, As full of yeeres, as fragrant fame; Leaving behinde, an honoured Name. The Life and Death of Zuinglius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. They that are willing to engage, and prove Themselves true Souldiers in the field of Love Must follow Zuinglius, whose ample glory Affords the World an everlasting Story. Ye Prelats of these Times, stoope downe and see The Wisdome, Valour and the Constancie Of this renowned Father; whose deserts Ought to be printed in all noble Hearts: He fell with Honour, and all those that fall, Guarded with Truth, deserve a Funerall Adorn'd with Angels, that all tongues may say, Here lyes Relig'ons and the Churches stay. Brave Zuinglius dy'd (though it be hard to doe) A valiant Souldier, and a Martyr too. The Life and Death of Colet.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Behold his Embleme, whose admired worth, Few Pens can prove sufficient to set forth Unto the World, and much lesse mine, whose skill Can be deriu'd but from an Infant Quill. He had a rare and well innobled heart, Whose rich endeavours gave a life to Art: He alwayes was ambitious to embrace, (Although t'were seated in the meanest place) True vertue; and he tooke delight to see Youth well adorn'd with Ingenuitie. Pauls Schoole can witnesse that his liberall Purse Was ever open to reward the Nurse That gave true Wisdome sucke therfore his Name Shall alwayes ride upon the wings of Fame. The Life and Death of Oecolampadius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, behold the rare-adorned Face Of him, whose very lookes import a grace; He was a Man whose constancy to truth, Ripen'd in age, and blossom'd in his youth: He was a rocke, whose daring front disdain'd Papisticke Waves he still oppos'd; and gain'd The upper hand, though threatning danger lin'd Each word he spoke, yet would he speake his minde: 'Twas not their proferr'd wealth could make him bold To sin in Want, and then repent in Gold; Religion was the Starre by which he steer'd His well run course, his heart was still endeer'd To sollid Principls, he lov'd to court The truth, Love was his Ship, and heav'n his port. The life and death of John Frith, who suffered Martyrdome, 1533.The attribution of this poem is questionable. In all past ages and preceding dayes, Heaven (to his honour, and eternall praise) Hath never left his Church, yet destitute Of faithfull Witnesses, both to dispute, And dye, too, for his spotlesse Uerity, (If cal'd therto) with all Sencerity, And admirale fortitude of minde; In which rare Role of Martyers we do finde Famous John Frith, an English man by nature; Who, from his youth, adorn'd his education With promptitude of wit, and other parts, Wherby he flourisht both in Tongus and Arts. And to conclude let all rejoyce and say, Religion was Friths prop, and he her stay. The Life &amp; Death of Thomas Bilney, who suffered Martyrdome, Anno Christi 1531.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Iust such another Saint-like singing Swan, Was blessed Bilney, born an English-man; Brought up in Cambridge University, Famous for Arts, and Parts, and Piety: Where by powerfull preaching, he converted Holy Hugh Latimer, then much perverted To Popery, made many a proselyte, Of's fellow-Students, by the Gospels light. At last by Card'nall Wolsey, prosecuted; Who, and his shavelings, with him off disputed, They by their subtill treats and threats at length Tript up his heeles, and foyld his humain strength, And caus'd him to recant: In which sad case, This blessed Saint about a twelve moneths space, In bitter anguish and perplexity Of Soul, in danger, in despaire to dye. At last, again, by Gods all-guarding grace, Recovered comfort did despair quite chace, And fill his Soul with such redoubled joy As all his former precious parts t'imploy, In constant and courageous preaching down The odious errours of Romes tripple Crown; For which our tongues may never cease t'expresse That Bilney's Crowned with true happinesse. The Life and Death of William Tindal.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Zeale crown'd his heart, and made him to out vie Papisticke stocks of Hell bred Tyranny; He feard them not, but boldly would dispute Against their swelling Errours, and confute Their Principles with a most dexterous art; His tongue was never Traytor to his heart; Truth was the hand that pointed to the way, Where full content and rich Salvations lay: T'was not a loathsome prison could devorse His ready lipps from the profound discourse Of true Religion, nothing could prevent His just endeavours, Time, he though mispent If not imploy'd to good; Reader, admire, His body flam'd to make his soule a fire. The life and Death of Urbanus Regius, who died Anno Christi 1541.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, this serious Fathers well-spent dayes Were fill'd with love, and love was fill'd with praise; He was abjured by a Noble race Which made him onely debtor, but not base; Heav'n was his port, to which he saild through tears, Steer'd by his faith, blowne by the winde of prayers; Let his example teach us to invest Our hearts with wisdome, and we shall be blest, With him who now enjoyes the life of pleasure, Whose comforts know no end, whose joyes no measure; He that shall choose true vertue for his guide May march on boldly, and not feare a slide. The Life and Death of Caralostadius who died Anno Christi 1541.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This grave Divine ceaz'd not from taking paines More for the Churches good, then his owne gaines; Yet were his gaines as great as his desire, He that obtaines true vertue need require No greater profit, he that studies how To live here-after, must not set his brow On Earths loe things: the pleasure of the Earth Prov'd this grave Fathers sorrow, not his mirth; His thoughts were all divine, he could not hide Within his Season'd breast, the flames of pride; He was an Image-hater, and would not Let them be worshipp'd and his God forgot; 'Twas not a Prison could his heart apale, He that has virtue, needs no other baile. The life and death of Capito, Who died Anno Christi 1541.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Industrious Capito at first inclin'd Himselfe to cure the body, next the minde; Being endow'd with most excellent parts He did (as t'were) monopolize the Arts: He lov'd Religion and was alwayes free T'extoll the worth of practis'd piety: He honor'd peace; his heart was fil'd with hope That he might live to contradict the Pope, And so he did he labour'd to prevent The Ceremonies of their Sacrament: And to conclude, he labour'd to confute Their babling Masse. He's blest without dispute. The Life and Death of Leo Judæ, who died Anno Christi 1542.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Heaven was the object where he fixt his eyes, Truth was his Marke, Religion was his Prise, His studious heart was active to contrive How to keepe other pining Souls alive With heavenly Food; he never lov'd to feed In secret Corners, and let others need; He never us'd to sweepe away the Crums From his poore Flock, and feed their souls with Hums Like our new-babling Pastors, which infuse Illiterate Words, patch'd up with flattring News. He would not blind them with the intising charms Of Falseties, or bid them take up Armes Except for heaven, within whose Tent he sings Anthems of Pleasure to the King of Kings. The Life and Death of Myconius, who died Anno Christi 1546.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Myconius was a man that lov'd to pry Into the bosome of Divinity; His heart was alwayes flexively inclind To what was good; he had a golden minde That would not bend to drosse, but still aspire To heaven, and faith gave wings to his desire; He was belov'd of all that lov'd Gods name. The trumpet of his voyce would still proclaime The word of God to those that would indure To have their wounds be brought unto a cure: By whose examples we may learne to thrive In grace; His present worth is still alive. The life and Death of John Diazius, who dyed Anno Christi 1546.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Diazius in his youthfull dayes had cloath'd His heart with Popery, and after, loath'd What he had done; for when he was inspir'd By Heaven, he searcht for truth, and soon untyr'd Himselfe; and having found the pathes of truth, He hated what he acted in his youth. Thus being turn'd from those wayes that lead To utter ruine, Fame began to spread Her wings abroad, and hover in the eare Of the distasted Pope, who could not heare Goodnesse without impatience, but strove To win him with reward of promis'd love: But finding t'was in vaine, he chang'd his minde From Love to Murther, and with speed inclin'd Himselfe to mischiefe being voyd of grace, Put out that light which shin'd so much in's face. The Life and Death of Cruciger, who died Anno Christi 1548.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Grave Cruciger, was in his life A hater of corroding strife; His soule was fil'd with Heaven and he Was alwayes constant, alwayes free In his devotions, all his dayes He spent to give his maker praise; Religions stocke did still encrease Within his heart, and crown'd his peace. He was a wonder to all Nations For Piety, and disputations. The Anabaptists felt the force Of his patheticall discourse. Truth alwayes shined in his brest; All men speake truth, that speake him blest. The Life and Death of Paulus Fagius. [Our first applauses unto Bucer wee]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Our first applauses unto Bucer wee Ascribe, the second we bequeath to thee, Whose knowledge in the holy dialect, A fame eternall will to thee erect. In that thou first didst bid the world godnight, Thou seem'st inferior to that burning light, But being first with heavens glory cround Thou dost appeare a Saint more worthy found; In other things both fitly did agree Both faithfull preachers of his veritie, Both painfull Sowers of the heavenly graine, Both blest with good successe, it sprung againe. Wherefore God blest you both with honor high And cloath'd you both with immortality. O happy soules though heaven keepe you there Your fame shall ever be intombed here. Your worthy praises all the earth shall know, Divulged by our Muses here below. [Reader, behold, here stands before thine eye]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, behold, here stands before thine eye, The perfect Embleme of true gravity: Turne from his face, then read, and thou shalt finde The rare endeavours of a serious minde. He was a man, whose ever-active heart Was alwayes digging in the Mines of Art; And (like a Bee) he labour'd every houre To sucke some Hony from each spreading Flowre. Twas not the face of poverty could fright His soule from goodnesse; Heaven was his delight, And earth his scorne: he study'd how to give A life to Language, and make Uertue live. It is not unfit, that he, whose Workes affords So many Languages, should want for words. The Life and Death of Martin Bucer.The attribution of this poem is questionable. That light of truth which shin'd in Bucers brest Inlightned others, and restor'd much rest To many, whose unquiet souls did lye Under the burthen of Idolatry. He was laborious, striving every houre To sucke some hony from each pleasing flowre; He was belov'd of all, that lov'd to pry Into the bosome of Divinity: Sweet was his life, and death; his well spent dayes Began in goodnesse, and expir'd with praise. The Life and Death of Casper Hedio, who died Anno Christi 1552.The attribution of this poem is questionable. T'was not the rage of Papist could remove The heart of Hedio from the reall love Of true Divinity; he still enclin'd Himselfe to Preach with a resolved mind. Let his example teach us to repose Our trust in God in spight of threating Foes. The Life and Death of George Prince of Anhalt, who died Anno Christi 1553.The attribution of this poem is questionable. A Prince by birth, and of a Princely minde, Full frought with vertues, of each severall kinde Is here presented; ornaments of grace, Such as doe challenge, not the second place, But first by merit: here you may behold One, whose rare vertues no Pen can unfold. In pious duties he did strive to be Transcendant; who was by nature free, For to the Poore he reliefe did give, During the time that he on earth did live. Read but his life, and then at large youle see, Monopoliz'd in him most vertues be. The life and Death of Justus Jonas, who dyed Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Justius by name, no poyson sure could kill, God so protected him, from what was ill: The venome of the Plague did seeme to be No poyson unto him, for he scapd free; Although the Duyon he by chance did eat, That poyson'd was, by the Plagues strong heat; Nor was his body, but his minde as free From the contagion of hels leprosie. For all his study was, how to obtaine That happy treasure, whereby he might gaine Heaven at the last; and sure unto that place He's long since gone; who was his Countries grace. The Life and Death of John Rogers, who died Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Though this grave Father was enfor'd to flye His envious Countrey for security, Yet his undaunted courage would not move, That alwayes stood (as Sentinell) to love. 'Twas not a prison could affection swage; He, like a Bird sung sweetest in a cage, When first the Bible, with great paines and care, He into English did translate so far, That knowing men did admire the same; And justly did extoll his lasting fame. Who did contemne the fury of all those, Who both to us and him were mortall foes. The Life and Death of Laurence Saunders, who died Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He from inferior Parents did not spring, But such, as noble were in every thing; Nor did his life, but to their splendor adde, Which make both them and all that knew him glad; For he in knowledge did so high excell, That passeth aut of man almost to tell: Whether his knowledge or his vertues were The more resplendant, yet a holy feare Did seem to equall both; and which doth crown Him all triumphant, he past Martyrdome With such high courage, and so rare a zeale, That I want words his worth for to reveale. The Life and Death of John Hooper, who dyed Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, behold, and then admire Hoopers most rich Seraphicke fire: His constancy was great; his heart (Balsom'd by heav'n) out-vi'd all smart: Rare was his life, rare was his death; Whilst time remains his fame shall want no breath. The Life and Death of Rowland Tailor, who dyed Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Among the many Champions of the Lord, Who with their blood to Truth did beare record, And feared not in furious flames to fry, That they Christs Gospels light might magnifie, Was pious precious Doctor Tailor stout; Who did the fight of Faith to th'death fight out. A very learned, painfull Pastor grave; Who to his Flock full testimony gave Of his great wisdome, charity and love, And all Soul saving graces from above: Who for opposing Romes impiety, Being apprehended and condemn'd to dye, He kist his Stake, being bound to it in chaines; Burning, a Popish wretch beat out his braines. And thus this blessed Martyr cheerfully, Went to his heavenly home triumphantly. The Life and Death of John Bradford.The attribution of this poem is questionable. See how undaunted Bradford hath display'd Truths golden Colours; nothing could invade His heaven fild thoughts, but heaven, in whose just cause He liv'd, though murther'd by Papistick lawes. Relgion told him that his cause was good, He need not feare to signe it with his blood And seal it with his heart; Bradford agreed, To signe, whilst Heaven was witnesse to the deed. Insulting Papists, what can ye declare But this, your foulnesse made our Bradford faire; Your fire refin'd his heart, and made it prove A perfect lover of the God of love. The Life and Death of Nicolas Ridly.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Read in the progresse of this blessed story Romes cursed cruelty, and Ridlyes glory: Romes Sirens song, but Ridlyes carelesse eare Was deaf. They charmd; but Ridly would not heare: Rome sung preferment, but brave Ridlyes tongue Condemn'd that false Preferment which Rome sung: Rome whispred wealth; but Ridly (whose great gaine Was godlinesse) he wav'd it with disdayne: Rome threatned Durance, but great Ridlyes mind Was too too strong for threats or Chaines to binde: Rome thundred death, but Ridlyes dauntlesse eye Star'd in deaths face, and scornd death standing by: In spite of Rome for Englande Faith he stood, And in the flames, he seald it with his Blood. The Life and Death of Peter Martyr.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Behold this Star, which seem'd at the first view Ecclipst with Romish fogs; but, after, grew So bright, that his Refulgence did display Truths Banner, beaming like the Sun of day. His sunshine was not visible alone In true Religions reform'd Horizon, But cast his foraign influence as far As th'Artick's distant from th'Antartick star; Uext Romes iugenious Malice did compact To quench this flame, but failed in the Acts. The seven crown'd dragons star confronting traine Lasht at this Star but lasht and lasht in vaine. Thus he remains (sustain'd by higher powers) A Saint in heau'ns bright Orbe, a Star in Ours. The Life and Death of Hugh Latimer.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Though Latimer was in his heedlesse youth A diviator, and abandon'd truth, Yet (heaven having blest him with a riper age) At last he banish'd his too forward rage, And from a wandring Commet, he became A blazing starre, and blush'd not to proclaime Against his former Errours which had spread Upon his heart, and almost struck it dead. He sought the way of truth, and seeking, found A better Anchor, and a firmer ground Where on he fixt his thoughts, and would not be Remov'd by arguments or Tyrannie. Thus our brave Latimer became a terrour To Papists, and an enemy to errour, Though he at first most wilfully deny'd The truth, yet for the truth at last he dy'd. The Life and Death of John Philpot, who died Anno Christi 1555.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Couragious Philpot with a dauntlesse brow March'd to his death, and would not once allow The least Submittance to erronious powers, But Scorn'd to smell on their impoysn'd flowers: And when he labour'd in the most distresse He was most chearfull, and would still addresse Himselfe to Heaven, where he was sure to find A healing Balsome to confirme his minde; He prayed to God, and hauing done, he cry'd, I thank, I thanke thee Father, and so dy'd: The Life and Death of Thomas Cranmer.The attribution of this poem is questionable. 'Twas not inticing Honour could remove The constant heart of Cranmer from the love Of sound Divinity, he alwayes stood Firme to God's Cause, and dy'd it with his blood: A true Seraphicke and Tyrannicke fire Prov'd (as it were) ambitious to aspire; And both prevail'd, being willing to controule; Th'one burnt his Body, th'other cur'd his Soule. Image adoring Papists, boast your fils; Ye sent a Soule to Heav'n against your wils. What can ye say, but this, your rage was spent; Ye did him good, though with an ill intent? Pricke up your eares, and heare this fatall tone, Those fires which made him screek, wil make you grone The Life and Death of Conrade Pellican, who dyed Anno Christi 1556.The attribution of this poem is questionable. After our Pellican had wandred long In the worlds wide-wildernesse, he grew so strong In grace and goodnesse, that he soon became An ample Subject for the mouth of Fame; He was admir'd by all that lov'd to be Serious proficients in Divinity; He lives, he lives, although his body lyes Inshrin'd by earth; True virtue never dyes. The Life and Death of Bugenhagius, who died Anno Christi 1558.The attribution of this poem is questionable. When the Cimmerian darknesse had forsooke Brave Bugenhagius, he rous'd up, and tooke Truth by the hand, and from a Foe he turn'd A friend to Luther, though at first he spurn'd Against his writings, yet at last his brest Repented what he rashly had exprest. Then like a Starre he shin'd and was content To teach himselfe and others to repent. The Life and Death of Phillip Melancthon.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Would thy ingenious Fancy soare and flye Beyond the pitch of moderne Poesye; Or wouldest thou learne to charme the conquerd eare With Reth'riks oyly Magik? wouldest thou heare The Majesty of language? wouldest thou pry Into the Bowels of Philosophy, Morall, or Naturall? Or wouldest thou sound The holy depth, and touch the unfathom'd ground Of deepe Theology? Nay, wouldest thou need The Sisteme of all excellence, and feed Thy empty soule with learning's full perfection: Goe, search Melancthons Tomes, by whose direction Thou shalt be led to Fame, if his rare story Can make thee emulous of so great a glory. The Life and Death of John a Lasco, who died Anno Christi 1560.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Wisdome and goodnesse both conjoyn'd To beautifie Alascos mind: He was laborious to fulfill And prosecute his makers will. His heart was proud to undertake, To doe, or suffer for Gods sake: Therefore no question but hee's blest, And rests in peace and endlesse rest. The Life and Death of Augustine Marlorat.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Marlorat did breath to give A breath to worth, which worth shall make him live; Uertue shall be his Heravl'd, and his name Shall stand recorded in roules of fame: The trumpet of his praise shall sound the bolder Because true vertue neede crave no upholder. The Life and Death of Amsdorfius, who died Anno Christi 1563.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Amsdorfius was the life of worth, his dayes Were fil'd with trouble, yet perpetuall praise Waited upon him; for he did oppose The Errours of the Pope in spight of those That were his enemies, he did maintaine The Pope was Antichrist, the Masse prophane. He fear'd them not, but boldly did professe The truth and now is Crown'd with happinesse. The Life and Death of Wolfangus Musculus. [This life is done, cold Death doth summon me]The attribution of this poem is questionable. This life is done, cold Death doth summon me: A life eternall I expect from thee My Saviour Christ: why dost thou fear my Dove? He will conduct thee to his throne above. Forsake this body, this corrupted creature: Thy God will change it to a better nature. Dost thou abound with sin? I do confesse That thou art guilty, and dost oft transgresse. But Christ his blood doth wash and cleanse all those, That can themselves in him by Faith repose. Doth Death appeare an object full of horror, Both ugly, ghastly, and not wanting terror. I do confesse it, but that life againe Which followes death doth take away that paine. Unto which life we called are by Christ; Then do no longer O my soule resist, But yeeld thou with all cheerfulnesse to dwell With him triumphing or'e Death, Sin and Hell. ['Twas neither fear nor danger, could estrange]The attribution of this poem is questionable. 'Twas neither fear nor danger, could estrange Undaunted Musculus, or make him change His resolutions; nothing could prevaile Against the bulwarkes of his Fort, or scale His wel arm'd thought; he would (in spight of those That were so barbarous to be his Foes) Proclaim the Truth, and would not let it rest (Untill discover'd) in his serious brest: He liv'd Gods faithfull Factor here below, To send him souls to heav'n, and to bestow That talent he had gave him that he might When's Master call'd, cast his accounts aright. The Life and Death of Hyperius, who dyed Anno Christi 1564.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Studious Hyperius alwayes lov'd to be In consultation with Divinity: He lov'd the truth, and alwayes striv'd to fly Upon the wings of true sollidity: Religion was his guide; he alwayes stood Firmely obedient unto what was good. The Life and Death of John Calvin. [How happens it that this is Calvins share]The attribution of this poem is questionable. How happens it that this is Calvins share, To lye under this little, unknowne pare? Is not this he who living did appeare, Decaying Romes continued dread and feare? Whose death the godly doth with sorrow fill, And at whose name the wicked tremble still? Whose life was knowne to be so holy, cleare, That vertue might have learn'd a lesson here? 'Tis true, but know that humble modesty, Which in his life did him accompany: That hath ordained this green and turfie cover, On his deceased Corpes to be laid over: But since thou coverest such an one as hee, How can the Marbles all, but envy thee. [Had we but such Reformers in our dayes]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Had we but such Reformers in our dayes As Calvin was, we should have cause to praise Their blest endeavours; but alas our Times Are daily acting (not Reforming) Crimes; Heroick Calvins heart was alwayes true To truth, and still would give the Church her due, His soul was truely willing to take paines, More for the publicke good, then private gaines. His life was fil'd with troubles, yet his mind (Even like the glistring Glow-worme) alwayes shin'd Brightest, when most surrounded with the night Of sad afflictions; Calvins whole delight Was in the law of God, from which his heart Being steel'd with truth, could not be mov'd to start. The Life and Death of William Farellus, who dyed Anno Christi 1565.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Farell liv'd a life, Not spotted with the staines of strife: He lov'd the thoughts, the name of Peace His vertues had a large encrease; Earth was his scorn, and Heav'n his pride: In Peace he liv'd, in Peace he dy'd. The Life and Death of Vergerius, who dyed Anno Christi 1565.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Those Popish errours which at first bore sway In our Vergerious heart, were chast away By the encreasing sun of truth; his minde (Which was before all drosse) was refin'd: And from a cruell enemy; became A perfect friend, and boldly would proclaime The reall truth; fear'd not to be withstood. Thus brave Vergerius turn'd from bad, to good. The Life and Death of Strigelius, who dyed Anno Christi 1569.The attribution of this poem is questionable. When a resolved heart is once inflam'd With heavenly motions, t'will not be reclam'd By easie termes, because a faithfull breast Is fil'd with Heaven, &amp; Heaven is crown'd with rest: And had not stout Strigelius his heart Been steel'd with courage, he had felt the smart Of a bad conscience; but he still persisted In what was good, and would not be resisted: Those wrongs and iniuries which he endur'd On earth, was by Heav'ns grand Phisitian cur'd. The Life and Death of John Brentius, who dyed Anno Christi 1570.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Toss'd in the ship of fortune Brentius sail'd From place, to place, his courage never fail'd; But with resolved Constancy, he bent His minde to suffer, free from discontent: The rage of Papists could not make him yeeld To their desires; True vertue was his shield; The strength of his afflictions added strength Unto his soul, his suffrings had no length Except of dayes, and them he knew to be But servile Subjects to Mortality: Thus like a patient sufferer he fled From earth, to heaven, and there repos'd his head. The Life and Death of Peter Viretus, who dyed Anno Christi 1571.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, observe the Malice of his Foes, Who having not the wisedome to oppose Brave Viretus by arguments; thought fit To labour with a diabolick wit To work his ruine; first by poyson they Contriv'd his fall; but poyson scorn'd to bey Their base desires, which made them rage and swell, Into a madnesse, till advis'd by Hell To a more speedy way, which soone took place Within their hearts; being destitute of grace They thought it good to imploy a Papist, whose arme Was ready to performe what might prove harme To harmelesse Viretus, and with a knife (As they suppos'd) depriv'd him of his life: But God (the great abhorror of such crimes) Preserv'd rare Viretus for better times. The Life and Death of John Jewell.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Holy Learning, sacred Acts; Gifts of Nature, strength of Parts; Fluent Grace, an humble minde; Worth reform'd, and wil refinde; Sweetnesse both in tongue and Pen; Insight both in Bookes and Men: Hopes in woe, and feares in weale; Humble knowledge, sprightly zeale; A liberall heart and free from Gall; Close to friends, and true to all. Height of courage in Truths duell, Are the stones that made this Jewell. Let him that would be truly blest, Weare this Jewell in his brest. The Life and Death of Zegedine, who dyed Anno Christi 1572.The attribution of this poem is questionable. How full of patience, how divine Was this our learned Zegedine? Though cast in prison, and restrain'd From food, yet he the truth maintain'd. His heart resolved from his youth Rather to starve, then starve the truth. For Disputations, few there were That could with Zegedine compare: His rare example lets us know, Patience o'recomes the greatest woe. The Life and Death of John Knox, who dyed Anno Christi 1572.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Undaunted Knox would never fear to tell The best their follyes, if they did not well: He was severe to those that would not Observant to his preach'd Divinity: He lov'd the wayes of peace, and would delight Himselfe in Cods just Lawes both day and night: His soul would be laborious to fullfill The sweet commands of his deare makers will. In peace he liv'd, and with a peacefull breath He call'd on God, and yeelded unto death. The Life and Death of Peter Ramus, who dyed Anno Christi 1572.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Industrious Ramus from his youth inclin'd Himselfe t'obtaine a well-composed minde: His heart was serious, and he tooke great paines To sowe good seeds, and after reape the gaines. He was belov'd of all that lov'd the fame Of learning; for he had a winged name. His care, his love, his industry was such, That in few years his heart attain'd to much: But in conclusion, Envie that still crowds Into true Fame, involv'd him in the clouds Of sudden ruine; Papists thought it good To take a surfeit of his guiltlesse blood. The Life and Death of Matthew Parker, who dyed Anno Christi 1574.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What Heav'n bestow'd upon him, he was free To give to others; for his Charitie Was known to many, whose impatient griefe Inforc'd them to implore his sure reliefe. His worth was such, that t'was disputed, which Pray'd for him most, either the poore or rich. The poore, they pray'd (as they were bound to do) Because he fild their soules and bodies too. The rich desir'd his life, because his store Sustain'd their soules, and help'd maintain the poore. Thus having spent his dayes in love, he went In peace to Heav'ns high-court of Parliament. The Life and Death of Henry Bullinger.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Never could worth lodge in a richer brest; Those blessings he enjoy'd, made others blest; He was compos'd of sweetnesse, and his heart Was alwayes cheerefull, willing to impart The truth to them that studyed how to grieve For sin, and would prove willing to believe. He was laborious and he could expresse Hatred to nothig, more then Idelnesse. Grave Doctors of those times would then submit To his profound, incomparable wit; For his grave judgment was so highly pris'd That most would act, what Bullenger advis'd. Is it not fiting then, that we should give Due praise to him, whose worth will make him live. The Life and Death of Edward Deering, who dyed Anno Christi 1576.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What greater Simptomes can there be of grace Then to be penitent; the greatest race A Christian can desire to run, is this Fron earths base centre, to eternall blisse. This race our Deering run; he spent his time Whilest here he liv'd in studying how to clime To Heav'ns high Court, true vertue was his prize, And God the object where he fixt his eyes: Faith, Hope, and Charity did sweetly rest Within the Councell Chamber of his brest: And to conclude, the graces did agree To make a happy soul, and that was he. The Life and Death of Flacius Jlliricus, who dyed Anno Christi 1575.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He was a man (as some reported) fit To be the Master of unquiet wit. He was contentious, which brought discontent To rare Melancthon; yet some time he spent In serious studyes, leaving at his death Rare workes behind, to give his fame a breath. The Life and Death of Josias Simlerus, who dyed Anno Christi 1576.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He was a man whose life and conversation, Furnish'd both eyes and eares with admiration: He was so pithy in his speech, that those Which heard him, gave a plaudit to his close: He alwayes meditated how to be A perfect Scholler in Divinity: He liv'd in Peace, his heart was still contented, His life was well belov'd, his death lamented. The life and death of Immanuall Tremelius, who dyed Anno Christi 1580.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This rare Hebritian, though at first confin'd To Iewish principles, at last inclin'd Himselfe to goodnesse, and imploy'd his heart To trace and follow a diviner art; And so improv'd himselfe, that he became From a small sparke, a most aspiring flame. And at the last he lay'd his tempels downe In Abr'ams bosome, and receiv'd a Crowne. The Life and Death of Peter Boquine, who dyed Anno Christi 1582.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This loyall convert carefully did strive, To make Religion and true vertue thrive: By his example many Fryars went To seek for Christ, and leave their discontent: They banish'd former errors, to imbrace The truth, and fill themselves with heav'nly grace: But sudden death made Boquines heart to faint; He liv'd a Convert and he dy'd a Saint. The Life and Death of William Grindall.The attribution of this poem is questionable. True vertue rain'd in Grindals brest, His Charity bespeakes him blest: He loved peace, and hated those That dar'd to prove Religions foes. Renowned Ridley took delight To see his vertue shine so bright; He like a star gave light to all That sat in darknesse, pinch'd with thrall, And thus this glistring star went downe, And set in Heav'n with much renowne Where now he beares his part, and sings Blest hallalujahs to the Kng of Kings. The Life and Death of Bernard Gilpin, who dyed Anno Christi 1583.The attribution of this poem is questionable. What pen can be sufficient to set forth Th'exuberous praises of brave Gilpins worth? Though at the first his heedlesse soul did stray, And ramble in a foule erronious way: Yet at the last he left those paths which bended Unto distruction; and his follyes ended: Then he began to exercise the truth, And hate the former errours of his youth. His soul was fil'd with piety, and peace; And as the truth, so did his joyes encrease: His fame soone spread abroad; his worth was hurl'd Through every corner of th'inquiring world. And to conclude, in him all men might find A reall heart, and a most noble minde. The life and death of Zachary Ursin, who dyed Anno Christi 1583.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Let those whose hearts desire to be Professor of Divinity: Trace Ursins steps; so shall they find The comforts of a studious minde: He had a greater care to nurse Distressed souls, then fill his purse: He would not tell a frutlesse story Unto his flock; his oratory Serv'd not flatter, but to bring Subjected souls unto their King: Where now he rests with him that says Shephards of Flocks, look to your wayes. The Life and Death of Abraham Bucholtzer, who dyed Anno Christi 1584.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Religion, Learning, both agreed to met, And make Bucholtzer prove their winding sheet; Nay, and their Sepulchre, for there they lay Imbracing in his little lumpe of Clay: He loved vertue, and his heart dispis'd To follow that, which Papists had devis'd; His balmy language heald the bleeding hearts Of them whose consciences retain'd the darts Of wounding sin; his soul still took delight To bring them out of darkenesse into light; But since hee's gon, what can we say but this, He rested here, with love, In heaven, with blisse. The Life and Death of John Wigandus, who dyed Anno Christi 1587.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Rare-soul'd Wigandus bow'd his whole desires, To warme his spirits by th'inlivning fires Of sacred fuell, and he alwayes stood Engag'd to that which heav'ns blest mouth call'd good; He was a man whose life, and conversation Were well sufficient to adorne a Nation With good examples: nothing could devorse His ready lips from the belov'd discourse Of heavenly matters, till at last he cry'd My God receive my soul, and so he dy'd. The Life and Death of Martin Chemnisius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This Authour, eminent Chemnisius grave, Among these worthies, a prime place may have; Who, by his most industrious pains ore came The many rubs which would have quentcht his fame: And to such height of learning did arise As made great Princes him most highly prize. Yea, so transcendently his fame did shine, That, One him stil'd, a most profound Divine, A prime Philosopher, one justly known, For parts and piety, second to none. And thus he liv'd, and dyed full of yeeres, And with much honour left this vail of teares. The Life and Death of Rodolphus Gualterus, who dyed Anno Christi 1586.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Uertue, and honor both combin'd T'adorne Gualterus his minde: His wise and well composed heart Was principl'd in every part, He was a Poet too, ti's therefore fit We should applaud his rare Poeticke wit. The Life and Death of Casper Olevian, who dyed Anno Christi 1587The attribution of this poem is questionable. Nor must Olevian also be omitted, But have a place of Honor fairby fitted Unto his fame, among these Heroes brave; Who, of his Parts in Arts much witnesse gave. A sound Divine, to Rome an enemy, Preaching Christs truth with courage, constancy: And who at last, as he had long desir'd, Exchanging earth for heaven, blestly expir'd. The Life and Death of John Fox.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Rare Fox (well furr'd with patience) liv'd a life In's youthfull age devoted unto strife; For the blind Papists of those frantick times, Esteem'd his vertues as his greatest Crimes; The hot persuit of their ful-crying hounds Forc'd him to flye beyond the lawlesse bounds Of their hot sented Malice; though their skill Was great in hunting, yet our Fox was still Too crafty for them; though they rang'd about From place, to place, they could not finde him out: And when they saw their plots could not prevaile To blesse their noses with his whisking tayle, They howl'd out curses, but could not obtain; Their prey being fled, their curses prov'd in vaine: From whence I thinke this Proverb came at first, Most thrives the Fox, that most of all is curst. The Life and Death of George Sohnius who dyed Anno Christi 1589.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Industrious, humble, prudent, patient, grave: What other vertues that a man could have Sohnius enjoyn'd with peacefulnesse: his hand Was apt to write, his heart to understand: He tooke delight to meditate upon The love of God; his owne salvation: He study'd how to dye: his wel-spent breath Was but a rare preparative to death: And having ended his laborious dayes, He dy'd in peace, and now he lives in praise. The Life and Death of Laurence Humfried, who dyed Anno Christi 1589.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Though persecuting Times pursu'd and chast This pious Father, yet he still embrac'd And hugg'd the Truth; his heart remained free From persecution and captivity. Those weighty words which pleasantly persu'd Out of his mouth, soon conquer'd and subdu'd Inticing Iesuits; he made them know Their errours by a fatall overthrow. Thus having labour'd with a faithfell brest, Heav'n thought it fit to crown his soul with rest. The Life and Death of James Andreas, who dyed Anno Christi 1578.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Ingenius Andreas alwayes lov'd to pry Into the bosome of Divinity. He hated idlenesse, and tooke delight In doing good; his vertues shin'd as bright As Fame could make them; and he alwayes stood A firme maintainer of the Churches good. Religion was his helme by which he steer'd His soule to heav'n; and there he was endear'd To his Creator; in whose Court he sings Blest halalujahs to the King of Kings. The Life and Death of Hieronimus Zanchius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He sought and found the truth, and would not hide That light from others that did still abide Within his breast, his soul was alwayes free T'advance the works of reall piety; Uertue, and gravity were both combin'd Within the ceture of his breast, and shin'd With equall luster; all that heard his voyce Were fil'd with raptures, and would much rejoyce At his discourse, for what his tongue exprest Alwayes proceeded from a reall breast. Let his examples teach us how to stand Firmely obedient to our Gods command: That at the last we may rejoyce, and sing Praises with Zanchy to heav'ns glorious King. The Life and Death of Anthony Sadeel, who dyed Anno Christi 1591.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Sadeel spent his dayes In giving the Almighty praise: He through floods of danger went To feed his flocke, whose great content Fatten'd their souls and made them thrive, (No foode like truth to keep alive) In grace; they ceas'd not to applaud His worth, that was not over-awde By Papists rage; t'was not a Goale Could make his lofty courage faile; Let his example teach us to expresse Our selves contented when we feel distresse. The Life and Death of William Whittaker.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Let such whose merits, whose indifferent fames Keepes life and soul together in their Names, With much a doe, let such require the praise Of hyred quils, to cleare their cloudy dayes With borrow'd Sunshine; let them strive to vamp Their wasted Mem'ryes, by another Lampe: Let those whom ordinary wrrth commends Receive Almes-praise from charitable friends: Our learned Whittaker craves no expression, Noe vote, no Trumpit but his foes confession; Whose well refuted Arguments proclame His everlasting honor, and their shame: He was the shield of Truth, the scourge of error, This Islands Tryumph, and proud Babils Terror. The Life and Death of Lambert Danæus, who dyed Anno Christi 1596.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Danæus that was acute and wise, Own'd vertue as his chiefest prize; He was a jem, that much adorn'd The Church, he much contemn'd; and scorn'd The wayes of Popery; his heart Was fil'd with comfort, joyn'd with art: He was esteem'd and lov'd of those That were industrious to oppose Erronious principels; his minde Was by heav'ns powerfull hand refin'd: Who at the last received his spirit And made him happy to inherit. The Life and Death of Robert Rollock, who dyed Anno Christi 1598.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Rollock, a most learned Scot, Deserves also, as his most worthy lot A Crown of Bayes, his learned browes to dresse; Who did such parts and piety expresse; Such gravity, mixt with sweet Clemency; Such love to truth, and spotlesse verity, As that the Scottish States minding to make At Edenburg an Academ, did take Especiall notice of him; and then sent Desiring him to take that Government, Which he perform'd with such diligence, That Scotland reapt great benefit from thence, He, on the sacred Scriptures Comments wrote, Wherof two were of such renowned note, That Beza of them, gave his witnesse fair, That they were rich, and prizelesse Treasures rare: This precious Saint thus piously did spend His dayes on earth, &amp; had heavens Crown in th'end. The Life and Death of Nicolas Hemingius, who dyed Anno Christi 1600.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Hemingius doth deserve to be Recorded in each memory. Who for his wit and worthy parts In Learning, Tongues, and exc'lent Arts, Was by Melancthon much respected, And for his learned gifts elected Hebrew Professour, worthily, In Hafnia Universitie; Where six and twenty years he stai'd With great esteem, and there was made A Doctor in Theologie, And full of years and love did dye. The Life and Death of James Heerbrand, who dyed Anno Christi 1600.The attribution of this poem is questionable. James Heerband was a rare Divine, most grave, Deserves a Garland of Fames flowers to have; Who, in all Learning was so excellent; And at his Studies constant, diligent, That his contemporary students said, He was a Sweviary night Crow. And, he made Such benefit his Studies up to rear, When he did Luther and Melancthon hear, (As oft he did) that he himselfe became A Preacher rare, and of surpassing fame; Commencing Doctor of Divinity; Made Tubings Pastor, with respect most high. Superintendent also there elected, And of the Germain Princes much respected. At last, his wife (who fifty years, at least, Had liv'd with him) did dye: his strength decreast, Together with her losse, and sicknesse, so, Upon his feeble corps began to grow; That neer the age of fourscore yeers, in peace, He chang'd earths wars, for heav'ns eternall peace. The Life and Death of David Chytræus, who dyed Anno Christi 1600.The attribution of this poem is questionable. In fames large Catalogue of worthyes rare Chytræus may impropriate ample share Of honour and renown; who from a lad An even Connative disposition had To learning, which his parents did promove, And which in time, he rarely did improve: Commencing at but fifteen years of age, Master of Arts; and with Melancthon sage In his owne house, was blestly educated, And most profoundly by him doctrinated. In whom Melancthon such proficiency Found, even unto admiration high That this his pregnant Pupill afterward, He as his son did tenderly regard. Chytræus also in processe of time, To such a highth of honour up did clime: For's excellency in all rare Literature As did from all that knew him love procure, And favour from the States of Germany, And as he liv'd, so honour'd he did dye. The Life and Death of Alexander Nowel.The attribution of this poem is questionable. As grave as godly Nowel Dean of Pauls, Most justly for a Crown of honour cals; Amongst other worthyes, for his piety His learning, wisedome and humanity: A famous Preatcher in the halcyon-dayes Of Queen Elizabeth, of endlesse praise. To Pauls-School, and to Braz'nnose Colledge he A Benefactor great was known to be. For's three-fold Catechisme, worthily, Much honour'd; and for his great Charity: Who at the age of Ninety years, in peace, And full of love, and honour did decease. The Life and Death of Daniel Tossanus, who dyed Anno Christi 1602.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Germane Tossanus doth deserve likewise, That we his honoured name should memorize; Who notwithstand all th'afflictions great Which furious faithlesse Popish Foes did threat, And prosecute him with, from place to place, And him, and his dear wife with terrours chace: In danger oft of death, yet mightily The Lord preserv'd them from Romes cruelty. He was a learned and laborious Preacher, And alwayes 'gainst Romes errors, a Truth teacher: Eloquent, witty, holy, humble, wise, And now his soul blest Heaven beatefies. The Life and Death of William Perkins.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Of all the Worthies in this learned role, Our English Perkins may, without controle, Challenge a crowne of Bayes to deck his head, And second unto none be numbered, For's learning, wit and worthy parts divine, Wherein his Fame resplendantly did shine Abroad and eke at home; for's Preaching rare And learned writings, almost past compare; Which were so high esteem'd, that some of them Translated were (as a most precious jem) Into the Latine, French, Dutch, Spanish tongue, And rarely valued both of old and young. And (which was very rare) Them all did write With his left hand, his right being uselesse quite; Borne in the first, dying in the last year Of Queen Eliza, a Princesse without peer. The Life and Death of the late reverend and worthy Prelate, Lancelot Andrewes, late Bishop of WINCHESTER.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, be serious let thy thoughts reflect On this grave Father with a large respect; Peruse his well-spent life, and thou shalt finde He had a rare, and heav'n enamel'd minde. He was our Kingdomes Star, and shin'd most bright In sad afflictions darke, and cloudyst night; Let his example teach us how to live In love and charity; that we may give To those, whose wants inforce them to implore Our ayde, and charity makes no man poore. Andrewes was fill'd with goodnesse, all his dayes Were crown'd and guilded with resounding praise. The world shall be his Herald to proclaime The ample glories of his spreading Fame. FINIS. The Life and Death of Franciscus Junius.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Reader, observe and thou shalt finde A rare, and well-reformed minde: He that in his youthfull dayes Scorch'd his conscience by the blaze Of wanton fires, refus'd at last The heat of an Athisticke blast; He started from the deep abyss Of vilenesse, to the height of bliss, And then that light which fil'd his breast Gave himselfe and others rest, That they which did before contemne His deeds, imbrac'd him as a Jem; And thought him fitting to be set Within the Churches Cabonet: His vertue pay'd what vice had scoar'd And age abhor'd, what youth ador'd. The Life and Death of Edwin Sands, who dyed Aug. 8. Anno Christi 1588.The attribution of this poem is questionable. He that will spake his praises well Must study first what 'tis t'excell: He daily labour'd to oppose The Churches most unsatiate Foes; The truth he would be sure to vent Though he endur'd imprisonment. Read but his Works, and thou shall finde His body was imprisn'd, not his minde. The Life and Death of Gervas Babington.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned Babington spun out his dayes In truth and peace, and had the ecchoing praise Of every tongue; his worth was priz'd by all That lov'd religion; nothing could recall His heart from goodnesse; peace, and love did rest Within the closset of his serious breast: Therefore let every tongue proclame and cry The fame of Babington shall never dye. The Life and Death of John Whitgift.The attribution of this poem is questionable. You courtly Prelats, you that feare To loose your honors, look ye here: Make him your president, and then You shall have honor, spite of men: He bred not, but compos'd debate, Nor mov'd he in the Orbe of State; By whose example, Churchmen stood Lesse for the stile of great then good: If factions chanc'd, or diffence fell, He would perswade, and not compell: To him our Phenix-Queen did share Proud Lambeths patriarchall chayre, Where he remain'd, the Churches Nurse, Ten years twice told, without a Curse. The Life and Death of Lucas Trelcatius, who dyed Anno Christi 1602.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Where vertue lives there need not be A question of sufficiency: Trelcatius was a man whose worth Few men are able to set forth: They that desire to know him well Must first know what it is t'excell. The Life and Death of Theodorus Beza.The attribution of this poem is questionable. If fame may be beleeved, I am he To whom an Infant can no relate be, Yet blest with issue by a higher fate And that both many and legitimate: Not onely people, with their priests together, But also Kings vouchsafe to call me father. Thousands of souls O Christ have been by me Begotten through thy holy Word to thee. Who knowes not learned Beza, what dull eare Hath not large volumes of his hist'ry there? Or what ill furnisht Gallery cannot show His reverend Picture, marshall'd in the row Of rare and moderne Worthies, to advance The glory of his pen renowned France? From whose more painfull and illustrious quill, Such Quintessence of sweetnesse did distill; Which like the dropping Hermony pearly dew, Refresht faire Syons plants, and did renew Their drooping spirits, wasted heretofore, And blasted with the breath of Babils whore; To whose blest name let every heart that did Ere prize true vertue, turne a Pyramid. The Life and Death of John Reinolds. [Between two Brethren civill warre and worse]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Englished by the Author. Between two Brethren civill warre and worse, The nice point of Religion long did nurse; For reformation of the Faith he plyes; That Faith should be reformed this denies. The reasons of each cause a part propounded; Both met alike, both fell alike confounded. As heart would wish, each one his brother takes; As fate would have, each one his faith forsakes: Without captiver both are captive led, And to the vanguisht camp the victor fled; What war is this, when conquer'd both are glad, And either to have conquered other sad? [This minute is the last we can]The attribution of this poem is questionable. This minute is the last we can Behold this rare accomplisht man. [Nor tongue, nor pen, nor Poets bayes]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Nor tongue, nor pen, nor Poets bayes, Can set forth his deserved praise. [Come friends and lend your helpe, let's now inter]The attribution of this poem is questionable. Come friends and lend your helpe, let's now inter Truths noble champion, and Romes conquerer. And never let the best, the chiefest dare, To wrong his ashes by a proud compare. Behold, in lesse then halfe a span, The lovely modell of that Man, Whose worth a world as big againe Were all too little to containe, That famous Reynolds; at the stroke Of whose learn'd Quill, Romes sturdy Oke Trembled; whom, had not early death Prevented thus, his very breath Had made such winde fals, round about In Babels forrest, that no doubt, In some few dayes, her savage Beasts Had found no covert; nor her Uulters nests. He was Times wonder, vertues story, Truths champion, and the Churches glory. The Life and Death of Joseph Scaliger, who dyed Anno Christi 1609.The attribution of this poem is questionable. How can the worthy name and memory Of Scaliger in black oblivion dye: Who by his pregnant wit and studious braines, And indefatigable care and paines: In Greek and Hebrew grew so excellent That being sent for, he to Leiden went, Where he was made Professour, and became A man of high renown and spreading fame: And gracing much that University For fifteen years, he there at last did dye. The Life and Death of Amandus Polanus, who dyed Anno Christi 1610.The attribution of this poem is questionable. How justly may Polanus have a part Of honour, 'mongst these men of high desert: A learned Doctor of Divinity, And was of Basils University: Chosen Professour, where, with love and fame, For fourteen years he managed the same: Then falling sick, he of a feaver dy'd, Whose soul doth in celestiall joyes reside. The Life and Death of Thomas Holland, who dyed Anno Christi 1612.The attribution of this poem is questionable. And worthily doth Doctor Holland merit His predecessours praises to inherit: Who for's great learning and his parts most rare Was Regius Professour, Doct'r oth' Chair: Of Exeter Colledge with approbation Of all that knew him even to admiration: I th'Schoolmen, and the Fathers so well seen As if he had Seraphick Doctor been. A pious and most painefull Preacher known A faithfull zealous friend to Truth; and One That heartily did hate idolatry, Who as he liv'd, a precious Saint did dye. The Life and Death of John Bale.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Untill it stunk, and stunk him out of dore. Twlve years he serv'd the Babilonian with; Drank of her cup and wallowed in her ditch, Untill the sunshine of diviner Truth Shot saving Beames into his hopefull youth: And led him thence to serve another Saint Whose mirth was teares, whose freedom was restraint; Whose progresse was a banishment; whose food Was want and Famine, and whose drinke was blood: His dayes were full of troubles, and his nights Were sad exchanges stor'd with feares and frights: His wealth was Poverty, his peace was strife, His life was death: His death eternall life. The Life and Death of Andræas Gerardus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. You that desire to lead a life Free from th'incumbrances of strife Draw neare, and with a carefull brow, Let brave Gerardus teach you how. Reader, observe and thou shalt finde, By trauell he inrtch'd his minde: His active heart was alwayes free To Propagate true piety. He alwayes studied to displace Errours from the Churches face: He gain'd no envy, but from those That were Religions chiefest foes. He would perswade, intreat, advise His Fellow-preachers to dispise, Those fruits of Idlenesse which he defy'd. Thus liv'd Gerardus, thus Gerardus dy'd. The Life and Death of Aretius Benedictus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. His name be-speakes him happy, and his worth Swels high enough to set his prayses forth In ample volumes; for his soul was lin'd With true Divinity; his serious minde Was alwayes active, labring to invest Distressed souls with true angel-like rest: Let his examples teach us how to be Content in truth, and love Divinity; That so at last we may receive those gaines That daily waite upon celestiall straines. The Life and Death of Mathew Parker.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Love, learning, wisedome and true zeale, Patience in want, and bounty in weale Were the chiefe flowers in that Crown Which gave this Man of men Renowne: The Crosiar did not supersede His Cure of souls, nor did he pleade Affaires at Court: His past'rall heate Grew nere the lesse as he grew great: Five Kings and Queenes, his dayes did see Enthron'd and septer'd: The first three Did view his merit, and enhaunc'd him, The fourth destroy'd, the fift advanc'd him To Lambech Chayre, where he the Church did guide In Peace; and full of age and honor dyed. The Life and Death of John Drusius, who dyed Anno Christi 1616.The attribution of this poem is questionable. John Drusius was a great Ebrician sound, Most meritoriously must here by Crown'd With Bayes, to's praise: whom for's ability In Hebrew, Syriack Chalde, worthily, The States of Hollaud, had Professour made Of him in Leiden, where not long he stay'd, Being call'd to Franquer University By th'Frisland States, where with great industry, For thirty years he govern'd it with fame, And then deceased with an honored Name. The Lif and Death of John James Grynæus, who dyed Anno Christi 1617. [As death's sad, so to rise is sweet much more]The attribution of this poem is questionable. As death's sad, so to rise is sweet much more, Christ as in life, so he in death is store: On earth are troubles, sweet rest in the grave: I'th last day we the lasting'st joyes shall have. [And this Grynæus worthy was, likewise]The attribution of this poem is questionable. And this Grynæus worthy was, likewise, That wee his Noble name should memorize: Who was a rare Divine in Germany, And made a Doctor in Divnity: At Tubing and to Basil, sent for thence To be Professour, where with diligence And profitable pains, and in that while The differance he did reconcile 'Twixt the Basilian Church and Tigurine; At last his labour made his health decline: And in his Pastorall Charge, in Basil he Ended his dayes in sweet tranquility. The Life and Death of Robert Abbot.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Surry, Oxford, Sarum clame Their severall intrests in our Abbots Name; Surry bore him, Oxford bred him; Sarum (ripe for high promotion) led him To honors Chayre: To whom he gave More lasting honor, then he could receive; This like a momentary Blaze Lent a faire light, but vanisht with his dayes; But that, like Titans brighter flame Continues coeternall with his Name: Nor is't the least addition to his glory That learned Featlyes pen hath writ his story. The Lif and Death of William Cowper, who dyed Anno Christi 1619.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Soli Deo Gloria. Here also Cowper, Scotlands Prelate grave, A place of honour doth deserve to have Among these Honour'd Heroes; whom the Lord Did many exc'llent Ornaments afford In piety and parts, but specially Making him prosperous in the Ministry, By's constant, and by's consciencious Preaching And holy life, which was a second teaching: Famous for's writings on the Revelation; Piously, thus persisting to's translation. The Life and Death of John Piscator, who dyed Anno Christi 1625.The attribution of this poem is questionable. This John Piscator born at Argentine, For his rare parts in Arts did fairly shine In Herborn, where Professor he became, And exercis'd that place with so much fame, That many Students out of Germany, France, Poland, and from out of Hungary, Came flocking thither for his grave direction, Which he afforded them with sweet affection: I'th Germane tongue the Bible he translated And it with learn'd Analisis ornated; And thus his dayes in pious pains being spent, At fourscore years his soule to heaven he sent. The Life and Death of Andrew Willet.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Abi, &amp; tu fac similiter. See here a true Nathaniel, in whose brest A carefull conscience kept her lasting feast; Whose simple heart could never lodge a guile In a soft word, nor malice in a smile: He was a faithfull labourer, whose pains Was pleasure and an others good, his gaines: The height of whose ambition was, to grow More ripe in knowledge, to make others know Whose Lamp was ever shining, never hid; And when his tongue preacht not, his actions did: The world was least his care; he sought for heaven; And what he had he held not earnd, but given: The dearest wealth he own'd, the world near gave, Nor owes her ought but house rent for a grave. The Life and Death of Scultetus.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Pareus also of high Germany, A wreath of Bayes deserves most worthily: A very learned, godly, grave Divine, Whose precious labors made his fame to shine, Chiefly those on the Romans. And although At first, he many straits did undergoe: Both by his Father and his other friends; Yet God who in deep straits assistance sends, Made all for his best good t'operate, And by them brought him to a blest estate; For he became abroad, at home renown'd, And was with many honours justly crown'd: Especially at Hiedleberge, where hee, From all earths feares was happily set free. The Life and Death of Thomas Erpenius, who dyed Anno Christi 1624.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Here may we not without much wrong deny, To this Erpenius honoured memory: Who was most famous in his generation, A man of exc'llent parts to admiration; And in the Orientall tongues so rare, That few or none with him deserv'd compare: For th'Arabick and Hebrew tongues likewise, The Kings of France and Spain did him so prize, Yea England, Holland, Germany, Italy Proffer'd great summes t'enjoy his company: And rare endowments, deep experience; At forty years of age death took him hence. The Life and Death of Abraham Scultetus, who dyed Anno Christi 1624.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Most worthy also is Scultetus grave, The Palme and prize of praise and fame to have: Who for his admirable wit and worth; His learned labours rare, in print put forth; Chiefly Medulla Patrum, that choyce piece, Preferred far to Jasons golden fleece, By all the learned. Had in high request For's eloquence and diligence exprest; By our King James and other Princes great; Who with most high applause obtain'd the seat In Hiedlebergs brave University, Of the Professour there; and worthily Made Doctor of Divinity. At last, Having much trouble with his comforts past; At Embden God him gave a quiet Station, And there by death crown'd him with heav'ns salvation The Life and Death of Robert Bolton.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Laus Deo. Of all the worthyes that deserv'd so well And did in parts and piety excell: And Garlands therefore of just honour have, None more did merit then this Pastor grave. Renowned Robert Bolton, one well known For his divine rare parts, second to None: Who though in's youth he seem'd a wicked Saul, In's riper years he prov'd a precious Paul: A most renowed preaching Son of thunder, Yet a sweet Barnabas (even to deep wonder) To sons of sorrow; and for Gods blest cause, Invincible in courage; and from pawes Of Sathans power, who pull'd afflicted spirits By comforts sweet: herein, being of high merits; And as for's preaching, so for's writings rare, Extant in print, even almost past compare: One of ten thousand for his piety, Constancy, wisdome, learning, gravity; Who as he liv'd belov'd, so blestly dy'd, And now his Sainted-soul in heaven doth bide. The Life and Death of William Whately, who dyed Anno Christi 1639.The attribution of this poem is questionable. Renowned William Whately also wins Like fame with Bolton, as two equall twins Of honour and renown; for piety, And admirable parts in's Ministry: In Latine, Greek and Hebrew rarely able, A Disputant also unconquerable. Of apprehension quick, of judgement clear, Strong memory; and that which was most dear, Of a most holy life and Conversation; Who many souls did win to Christs salvation: And Divine-like in Scriptures eloquent; In Prayer, Preaching faithfull and fervent: Much charity and love, who still exprest Among his people a Peacemaking blest: Pittifull, patient, full of courtesie: His soul with Christ now raignes most gloriously.
