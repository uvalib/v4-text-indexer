      <field name="fulltext">Edwarde More to hym that wrothe the booke called the Schole howse of women. If thy name were knowen, that wrytest in thys sorte, By womenkind vnnaturally, gyuyng euil reporte, (Whom al men ought both yong &amp; old, defend with all theyr might, Considering what they do deserue, of euery lyuing wyght As in there trauayle taken, sometymes with losse of lyfe, To br?g such wretches to this world, which make not only strife But beyng come to perfyte age, can skant gyue &amp; aforde, Unto theyr d?mes y? gaue th? suck, so much as one good word.) ywys thou shulde exiled be, from women more and lesse, And not without iust cause, thou must thy selfe confesse, Onles as in thy booke, so now thou lyst to lye, Where are nothinges but rayling iestes of the pore femynye. Thy booke intytled is the Scholehouse of women, A tedious thyng for them to reade, not pleasant vnto men: The style therof declareth no lesse, but that thou art right sage, And lyued hast so longe perdye, that now thou dotest for age, Lesse meruayle then it is, that if thy othe be spent. And of eche one reiected arte and hated as the lent: Though thy melancoly, thau canst not els assuage, No kynde of way but only thus, on women for to rage. Pean to be a folysh worke, thou dost testyfye Whych lyke a learned poet, by the fygure onomatopei, Tr?sformed thou hast into pecock, as proude of hys longe tayle, Marck I pray the well, how much there thou doest fayle, Pean is more lyke in sounde in our mother tonge To pehen then pecock, whose tayle is not so longe, Nor set with sundry colors, nor of so pleasaunt hewe, That she doth boast &amp; brag theryn, is not thys ryght kewe? All men that learned be, allowe the in no case, All women eke that wytty be haue cause to curse thy face All maydens that vyrgynytye, do couet styll to kepe, Through thy accusacyons, haue now iust cause to wepe All yongmen that intende, to lyue in Uenus lawe I meane in matrymony, hauyng of god the awe May well deryde &amp; mock thy folyw &amp; lewde pranck Wherin, I dare be bold to say, thou had more payne then thank In married men such feare there is, and such contynuall awe That moost of them beleue ywys they be of moyses lawe And fynaly to conclude, the beste and eke the wourst, For thys thy foolysh entrepryse, may hold the well accurst. Repent therfore repent I say, acknowledge ones thy fact, Recant I rede the, &amp; confesse, thy lewde &amp; synfull act, Which doth not hurte to one, but all of eche degree Haue cause to bend theyre browes therat, as oftn as they it see Although to call it in agayne, it be now past thy hand yet to recant ease thou shalte fynd, I wyl thou vnderstand For yf that Iudas perdan had asked by and by Of god he had obtayned it, as scriptures testifye Now to conclude and make an end, I wyll apply my wytt In writing for good women all as is moost meete and fitt. Finis. Here begynneth the booke called the Defence of Women, made by Edwarde More. Venus vnto the for help, good lady I do cal, For thou wert w?t to gra?t request, vnto thy serua?ts al. Euen as thou dyddest help alwayes, Aeneas thyne owne chylde, Apeasing the god Iupiter, with countena?ce so mylde, That though that Iuno to turm?t hym, on Iupiter dyd prease, Yet for the loue he bare to the, dyd cause the wyndes to cease, I pray the pray the muses all, to helpe my memorye, That I may haue ensamples good, in defence of femynye, Them to defend of dyuers thynges as slaunders manyfold, I haue taken vppon me, as a Champyan bold, Replye that lyst agaynst me I wyll them well Assure To spende my tyme in theyr defence, whyle my lyfe shall indur Although I want the grauytye, of Cato that was sage, Which hard it is to fynde, in any of myne age, And Ciceros eloquence is very hard to fynde In a curtyer truly, accordyng to my mynde Senecaes breife sentences, although that I do wante Within Curtius style kepe me can I skant yet Salust south in wrything trewth, I trust I shall attayne And as directly as I can, declare my matter playne, Fyrst I wyl make it manyfest that women beare much blame And men are more infaut, deseruyng styll the same, As the litle cobwep taketh the small flye, The swallowe fleyng through easely passyng by And as the pore &amp; nedy man hanged is sometyme When the rycher skapeth, for a greater cryme, So doth the sely woman of eche degree and sorte Runne in slaunder vndeserued, by meanes of mens reporte Wherby thys proued be sheweth playne no lesse true then olde That thei moost ofte that wurst may, the candle vse to holde This to be true, what better profe then by Eue may be brought Which dyd Adam attempt, to do that thynge was noughe Dyd not the deuyll endeuor, to reclayme her to hys fyste Bycause he knew her feblenes, not able to resyst What was y? deuel? man or woman I wold some good deuyne Wold take the paynes thys questyon to vs once to defyne Aman, I thynke in dede, of Lucyfers owne trayne For of a woman dyuell, I neuer red certayne Whan Lucyfer fyrst fill into the pyt of hell At gods appoyntment for hys pryde therin styll to dwell There fell with hym a numbre moe of men, whose sodeyne fall All women yet remaynyng here, may rue the tyme and all Had not the serpent tempted Eue, who cold as sermyse? So shamfull acte to bryng her forth of ioyfull paradyse And besydes all thys, when she delyuered had To Adam the forbidden fruyte, to taste &amp; hym had bad She knew then no deceyt, I dare for her appose, And Adam then to tast therof, I thynk sure myght haue chose, For she reherst the word addyng no whyt more To that the synfull serpent, had to her told before: And yf that he to Adam fyrst, had cum, no dowt he myght Haue tempted hym aswell as Eue thys thyng declareth it ryght Predestinate she was therto, to withstand it, not knowing how All Chrysten men ought to lament therfore I make avowe And not to cast it in her teeth, and on her thus to iest, A foule byrde it is perdye defyleth his owne nest Wherfore cam he to Eue? I haue tolde you before Her lacke of strenght &amp; nothyng els, was cause of her forlore, yf lack of strength bewty wyt, in women be detecte It lyeth not in them, these sayd thyng to correcte Nature fourmeth folks accordyng is to gods wyll, In god it lyed and wan els then to make or spyll. But Adam beyng ruler of see and eke of lande That Eue to hym was subiect, it may well now be skand And hauyng strenght sufficient, wanting nowght but grace So wolde offende our sauyour Christ to lese that ioyfull place Wherin he felt no woe, wherin dyd nothyng mys To lede hys lyfe in heauenly ioye, who can saye well by thys And yet men wyll transpose the faute to seely Eue But no man that the trouth doth rede, wyl them I thynk beleue Wherfore I trust I haue, declared here at large That fawth c?mytted by the men, are layde to womens charge Consydre now theyre ponishement appoynted by our lord To helpe my saynges somewhat, no dout it wyl accorde With daunger of theyre lyues, theyr children they do beare Theyres ouerthrouges in labor, hys meruell to heare And after they be borne what dilygence they wse To bryng them vpin fearing god, no labour they refuse, And we do dayly see suffyciently exprest How nurses often wake when most men take theyr rest. Wolde Iesus haue bene borne, of Mary vyrgyn myldee And humbled hymselfe to her as a louyng chylde Onles that they were innocent and as the do pretende Styffe stowt nor arrogant, nor ready to offende Alas may I saye than, that any Christen man Shuld wryte such thynges by women that synce y? world began I dare well saye, they neuerdyd, nor yet so much as thought How much to blame are men to saye, that women be so nought And them thus to vpbrayde, with theyr barre passyng loue, with w?ton eyes &amp; sugred lippes wher w? m?s harts they moue with all theyr myght &amp; mayne, to follow wanton wyll Wherin our poet doth recyte, they haue neuer theyre fyll How farre from all the truth, how lyke it soundes a lye By reasons moe them one or two, thus may all men it trye, The hoter that the contrey is the proner to offende And to venery, more lyke to condiscente, The people are, and as I haue ofte rede Where wyues are ryfest, there, a man may best be spede And on the other partye the colder that is The lesse desyre and appetyte they haue to do amysse And besydes all thys, the fayrer that they be, To more resorte of men there is, them to beholde and see The more resort of men in daunger soner runne What dayly dryftes do men deuyse? vntyll they haue th? wunne wyth Rome make I comparison if I may be so bolde And England do affirme to be then it farre passing colde, Wherby I meane in dede that Romaynes are more bent Then Englysh women be to such thynges to consent Lesse wander they abrode, wherby the byting ayre Can theyr bewty in no point dyminish and appayre Which of sundry wayes, the next way is of all As I haue shewed a lytle before, customers to call Where our Englysh women do spare them selfes no whyt But vp and doune the fyeldes to and fro do flyt The Ladyes to the Court do dayly take theyr traydes Besydes a trayne of seruyng men, accumpannied wyth maydes That be the wether foule, or be the wether fayre To wether being open theire bewty must appayre Wherby a man may iudge that of the people twayne En Englysh women to be more chast, farre then the Romaine This also I do note and thinke to be moost true That most of al by yelosy daunger doth ensue To men (in mine opynion) no people vse it more In lookyng strayte vnto theyre wyues, as I haue told before Wherby it fareth thus with them, to be a prouerbe ryfe To iudge the romayne harlot, better then the wyfe which vse not so frequent in England wherby we Englyshmen do well auoyde that perlous yoperdye Now of Romaynes haue I redde, innumerable good As fyrst of all, of Lucres that cam of noble blood when Tarquyn the proude, desyred her company Lyuy wyll the same affyrme and testifye, Thys Tarquyn (whome I named) dyd prese to do that dede which caused her and also hym not very well to spede Fyrst wyth fayre wordes began he Lucres to entrete And when they could not take affecte, then he began th threte with his naked sword, to take away her lyfe, Alas good Brutus where wert thou? to succor then thy wyfe And fynally agaynst her wyll Tarquyn lay her by The cryme is deedly for a kyng to do such vylany which when by hym was dun, a way and he was gonne She sendeth for her husband and kindred eche one And bearyng in her hand, with her a naked knyfe In presence of them all, she ended there her lyfe But before she dyed as Lyuye doth reporte with a heuy hart (god wot) spake after such a sorte O my husband deare why do I lyue thys daye Syth that (but not wyllyngly) I haue the now betraye And most against my harte the godes do know right well That feare of death and nothing els, was cause now that I fell Tarquin the proud hath rauyshed me thys nyght wherwith she wept full pyteously, her teares distilling bright From her eyes, and sodeinly, dyd thrust into her harte The knyfe, so ended she her lyfe, in dedly woe and smarte Alas, what hart so hard, as is the merble stone yf he had sene thys dolefull syght, wolde not haue made greate mone For her, who lyeng ded as white as any lylly whose cruell death dyd playnly shew and for her testyfy That she was voyde from vice, not giltie of that gylt And yet in satysfaction her hart blud there she spylt Lucres of Tuskayne also is come vnto my mynde which to Eurylaus shewed her selfe so kynde That beyng but a straynger borne and her deperted froe Dyed for very sorow, the story telleth soe, why loued she an other, alas, syth she was wedde Marryed she was against her wyll she had as leue ben dedde As hym to husband take, but that she might not chuse For at her frendes c?maundement she durst hym not refuse So that not only she, but tother of her sorte Are to be lamented much, as voyde, of all cumforte For of these twayne they must do one, w? god eyther nedes glose, Or els if god they please, theyr parentes strayt way lose, Happy be they I say then, whose choyse to chuse is free For though they haue but lytle, no dought they shal agree What saye ye nowe to Ouyds wyfe, which banyshed to bee Desyred much, &amp; leaue al thinges in Rome where she was free With her husbande to haue gonne, to take such parte as he What fayth there is in womankynde, a blynde man may wel see Susanna also and Iudith with dyuers others moe Out of scriptures colde I bring, but nede requyreth not soe, For of forrayne examples these are ynough to vewe yet shall I one recite whiche also is moost trewe A kyng there was y?

When she had herd hym speake, the wordes exprest before Thynkyng no lesse in dede but that he longed sore And doted in her loue, hauyng no mystrust But thought by hys perplexitie that he was very iust Her tendre hart then melted to see hym in that case Wept and sobbed woundrous sore, that for a certen space, She cold not speake one word, for sheddyng teares so fast Her hart she thought immediatly, wold verely haue brast When she had cesed her wepyng, and thagony was past Pausyng with her selfe a while, sayd vnto hym at last where y? you wysh your cha?ce had bene, before this to be staine No cause there is ywys, that dye you shuld so fayne, And that your dobble improsoment, you lay vnto my charge yt lyeth in my pouer to set you now at large, For whither you loue your contrey, and set but lyght by me, Or whyther you loue vs both a lyke, I can now set you free And in accusing me, to hate the Englysh name, Without a tryall of the same, in dede you are to blame, To aunswere you therfore, as dyrectly as I can I had rather marry you, then a Scottysh man And plyght me here your troth, for so I thinke it best And I shall do the some, and graunt you your request Leade me with you home, &amp; there do you me wed According to your Englysh lawes, to bourd and eke to bed Money for our charges ynough I shall prepare, And for your sake the residue, shall the better fare, He swore vnto her othes ryfe, that all thinges shuld be so well sayd she to morrow night, we foure, away wyll go So when the nyght appoynted cam, the Yayler toke hys rest Hys Doughter tooke of money, as much as she thought best The keyes she stale away that lay vnder his hedde The prison gate then openyng, away them three she ledde which when they were escaped theyr peryll and theyr payne, As crafty kaytyfes worthy death, dyd send her back agayne, ye moderators of the scoles, ye iudges of the bench was not this a heynous cryme, to vse a louing wench Who for very loue of one, dyd make them al so free And well contented was, with hym away to flee Leuyng countree father, mother, brother kyf and kyn But when she was betrayed, what sorow was she in? Fyrst, what was her fathers gryef? the prisoners beyng lost, What sorow to his harte? and to his purse what coste? And when he knew hys doughter to be ledde waye, In what a traunce was he? no man I think can saye Hys wyfe and eke his sonne, and all the wenches kyn Lamented much and dyd bewayle, her foolysh parte therin And the sely wench, was in worst case of all Not knowing for her life on her what shuld be fall Wherfore she went not home agayne for feare as I do gesse But ledde her lyfe tyll death dyd come, in wofull heauynes, Thus may ye se exprest, the nature here of men, And yet they wyll affirme women worse then them Uyrgyll once appoynted to haue layen a woman by Perswaded her therto, there was no remedy And when that she perceyued, that he wold haue no nay, So that you come this night (saith she) I wyl your mid obay, I my selfe do lye (quod she, in a chaumbre hye And my husband lieth beneth in a chambre bye wherfore I can not well deuyse, how in you may be brought No kynde of way but only thus, which now I haue be thought A wyll let doune a basket, by a corde perdee, By meanes whereof you sitting in, shalbe drawen vp to mee? Uyrgyll trusting so, his purpose to obtayne According as it was a greed, at night he cam agayne, Where he founde the basket by a lyne let downe in dede And quyckly leping in trusted well to spede When knowledge that she had, aboue, that Uyrgyll was therin She plucked hym halfe way vp, that donne to make a pyn Of woode or some lyke thing, she put her selfe in vre Wherunto she tyed the rope for slydyng made it sure, So that Uyrgyll when no way, escape knew how he myght Of force he was constrayned there to tarry all the nyght Untyll the next morninge, that it was brode lyght daye Where when that he espyed was, al folkes at hym had playe Thus it is ryght euydent and manifestly shewede That women are ryght honest, and men are very lewede As touching the apparayll now, which women vse to weare Theyr verdyngalles and cassockes, the perting of their heaee Wherwith that they waxe proude our Pote sayth sure, At home lyke dyuelles they be, abrode lyke aungelles pure, These thinges lowfull to be, and tolerable toe, By reasons good and probable, I shal it strayt wayes shoe A woman hauing nothing but at her husbandes hande That he thus maynteneth her it may now welbe skande Who is then in moost fauor? who ought to beare the blame? Not she that weareth them, but he that byeth the same, Tollerable not withstanding, that such apparayle is What harme lyed hydde therein, I wolde fayne knowe but this First, to a cassocke (I am sure) lesse cloth they do allowe Then to agonne or frocke, wherfore consyder now? More profyt is it farre, lesse cost also perdye Honest therfore his, it can none other be, For Tully in his Offices, sheweth by wordes exprest That nothing can be profitable, onles it be honest, To the parting of theyr heare and showing of the same, yf men do the lyke thyng, why beare they then no blame? In combing of theyr berdes, in strokyng them full ofte In wassyng them with wassyng balies, in lookyng all alofte In plaitting of them diuers wayes, in byndyng th? in bandes Wherein their hole delyght alwayes, consystes and standes No meruayle then though women lerning it of men Do combe and plat theyr heare, &amp; dresse it nowe and then yet women be dispraysed where men are moost in faute Ex?ples such to gyue theyr wyues, which they ac?pt so naught yf a precher shulde vs teach, drunkennes to shun, And hedlong to that vyce, he hym selfe shuld run, Who were in most fault who were most worthy blame, He that herde the sermone, or he that preced the same, As touch?g now theyr verdingalles, which do men much off?de I deferre them not tyll now as hard for to defende For as men in thother thinges haue bene in greatest cryme, So can I not holde them excused, at thys present tyme, Who fyrst inuented vardingalles it must be called to mynde And by whom also they were made, we must in lykewyse fynde Taylers (as I gesse) were the fyrst founders then What kynde of people be they women or els men The most of all our fashyons of garmentes whiche we vse, Of what so euer sorte they be playne or els dyffuse, Straungers them inuent, of straungers them we lerne As by our Spanysh hose &amp; shoes, a man may well dyscerne, The french gownes &amp; the Duche, which women vse to were And also theyre french hoodes, theym broddyng of theyr heare, From Fraunce &amp; Fla?ders fet were, by merchandes of our lande They tought their wiues to were y? sawe it may be vnderst?de For women trauaill not to see the countreyes farre, For although they wolde, theyr husbandes yet wold th? therof quite barre But if there be anoueltye cha?ced in Almayne, Fraunce, Flaunders, Italy, Portyngale, or Spayne, Or any other regyons where men haue ledde theyre lyues At theyre c?myng home, they declare it to theyre wyues, And some for lacke of newes, some thinges they do deuyse Accompting it a shame, there be some so precyse, To know nothing al all and so long tyme to spende Wherfore to bringes home nouelties, they alwayes do entend And tollerable it ys (the south to say) in those That a yoyrney vnto Rome, vnto them selfes haue chose, For thei that come from thence, as one doth specyfye May tell a lye or twayne, by Romes authoritie, what pride can the pore verdyngalles increase in women kynde The stuf that goeth to the same, is easy for to fynde As fustian or buckram, lystes and eke redde cloth A costly thing I promise you that men shuld be so wroth Suppose they be of veluet, sylk or cloth of gold what wytty man is he? therwith fynd fault that wold Although for money often times there is debat &amp; strife And for the same many a man in time hath lost hys lyfe Yet money is not euyll, nor ought to beare no blame The only fawt remainth in them, that do mysuse the same, So garmentes, I affirme, what so euer that they be, Are decent for all wemenkinde, regarding theyre degre As sone may a man, in a begger fynd, As proude an hart as in a lorde which groweth out of kind The prouerbe semeth contrary to iudge pryde in the lord For euyl doth a lordes hart and a beggers purse accord where excessyue talke is layd to womens charge, And that men cast it in theyr teeth, theyr t?gues to run at large Graunt it so to be, as itis not verely But that they be thus staundred alas what remedy yet were it but a small fault, in authors syd we fynde True to be and credyble, wordes to be but winde, Theyr tonges I think offended haue, on earth no lyuing man And if thei had, forthat that men, neyther will nor can, With them once beare, how farre they run astraye ye shal perceyue if that ye note, sainct Peter who doth saye, ye men bere with your wyfes whiche weker vesselles be, But yet the weke the burden bere, as ye may herby see Many husbandes all the day, sytting at the wyne, At night comyng relyng home as dronken as are swyne, Theyr wyfes therof ashamed be, and th? strayt way exhort At home to tarry and be merry to flee all such resort wherwith the men waxe angry, theire wyfes be so bold And if they speake a lytle loud, men say strait away they skold wherfore I meruaile much and so do moe then I That women beare so great a blame, &amp; no cause to be why And fynally to conclude, I haue the greater ruth That innoc?tes shuld sla?dred be, but time shall trye the truth.
