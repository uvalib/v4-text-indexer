      <field name="fulltext">[He trod the lonely path of truth and light] TO THE MEMORY OF JOSEPH PRIESTLEY He trod the lonely path of truth and light; He saw, beyond the shadow of his land, A gallant people hold with single hand The world at bay, for liberty and right, And bade her speed. For this, while very night Blushed to behold, the brainless rabble-band, To please our bigot sires, with impious brand Devoured his home and drave him from their sight. Discloser of the secret of the wind, We, who repenting of that dastard flame Have learnt with late remorseful bays to bind Thy marble brow, our glory and our shame, Are twice partakers of our fathers' blame, If to strange lights we too are proud and blind. Birmingham, 1891. THE MARCH OF MAN Canto I Blind—then a little light—and once more blind. Blind in birth's living shroud, there blindly reared, Thence blindly driven—and lo! a drowsy babe, Its red face wrinkled like a fresh-blown poppy, Whose silken petals keep awhile the crease Of every fold they slept in. Day by day The light grows friendlier, till the strange great eyes, So vastly vacant, so profoundly grave, Stare hopeless, fearless, loveless at the world. Then dawn of soul and day of strength, then dusk Of fading dreams—a sigh—and once more blind. From darkness unto darkness; and this hour Of shattered lanterns and of naked lights Doth but the more reveal the enfolding gloom. What recked our brute forefathers of the cave? They slew and ate, begat and slept; to them Earth seemed not one stale cradle, one stale tomb, Floating untended through the boundless void; The weakling's moan, the spoil of lust and rage To them brought no misgivings; and we saints, We sinners, curbed and bridled into crime, Our tender souls self-tortured with remorse, Envy them oft their blameless guiltiness. Death grins at birth, and birth makes mock of death; Death, birth, and death—O weary, weary round, If self were all!—to think it, is to droop, To live it, is to die. Away with self! Not beasts of prey, but human hearts of love! Not claws of greed, but eager hands of help! Not civil foes, but comrades in one cause! Forward!—we cannot backward, if we would— Forward through law to righteous lawlessness! The generations pass into the dark; They fold themselves in silence, and are gone; Their loves and hates, ambitions, wrongs and tears, Pangs of the body, puzzles of the brain, Vex them no more. In vain our men of light Dissect the living nerve, in vain our priests Plead with the God of old, in vain our seers Question the heart of mystery—the deep Gives back no answer, and the ghosts that thronged Faith's morning-twilight visit not her noon. Noon?—rides the sun so high?—or lingers low Beyond the horizon, while we wisely take Marsh-lights for stars, and starlight for the prime? Those altars yet outface the storm, whereby The gaunt white-bearded prophet of our sires Stood, drenched with human gore; he doubted not His night was day; and we, who hail some few Pale streaks of morning, howsoever fair And fraught with promise, for the light of noon— That open glory of the sunlit heavens, That desert-dreamland moving as we move— Are blind as he, and children of his pride. Yet Progress doth not halt, but holds her way, O'er dust of ancient wisdom, power and wealth, O'er palaces whence kingly pomp hath fled, And temples where dishallowed gods lie low, Heavenward. The soldier sinks, the host moves on; It marches o'er the dying and the dead, Tramples, but after worships; for the fallen, Whose closing eyes through cloud of battle-smoke And mist of death beheld the promised land, Are foremost conquerors. The march of man Lies through a mountain-region; each life-path Leads o'er a mountain's brow from vale to vale. Some slumber in the vale of infancy; Of such as climb, some choose the lower path And some the loftier; some the storm-bolt slays, Some stumble o'er the precipice, and some Sink overtired and perish in the snow; The loneliest victor of untrodden peaks Descends at last into the vale of age, Weary and travel-worn; and lays him down— With boys that wonder at the next white peak, Restless to climb—beside some placid pool, And dreams it doth not move. But on the heights Stands Manhood, firm, erect, alert, and tracks, Ere he too fall asleep upon the shore, The windings of the stream of Time, now seen, Now hidden, backward to its secret source, Forward to shining visions of the sea. For Time is not a whirlpool, but a stream; It hath its eddying cycles, cataracts, And quiet-gliding deeps, with here and there A backward current born of overhaste; But the whole mass of waters onward bears Toward, who shall say what dream of golden peace, Or, if our sadder moods forbode the truth, Toward silence, darkness and forgetfulness— What then? The world is young, and who would shrink To play the man, though death indeed close all? We perish, but the victory lives on; Our eyes grow dim, our hearts grow faint, the sword Shakes in our grasp; we yield it to our sons, Bless, send them forth, and lay us down to die. Old age doth well to guide, restrain and warn, But youth is the true prophet; the hot heart, The eager eye, the ecstasy of faith, The joy of daring—these have won the world; And he that hath them, being old, is young. Children of light, arise!—the shadows flee, The daylight is at hand! There was a noon When Rome's imperial eagle, poised aloft, O'erawed the savage West; then darkness fell, And in that darkness greed and lust grew fat; Children forgot to blush, women to weep; Whole cities thronged to see men bleed for gold; The rabble fawned, the noble tossed them bread; The good and true chose death; a pool of gore Reeked round the throne, and each bloat murderer That sat thereon was God. Into the midst Of that foul gloom a lowly beam of light Stole from the East, and steeped in sacred blood Slowly prevailed and widened into day; The breath of life swept through those fetid mists; Christ's Vicar sat in Cæsar's seat, the slave Leapt from his chains, the brothel-temples fell, Cathedrals rose to Heaven like prayers in stone, And kings paid court to holy men who wore The Master's crown of thorns, ate of the field, Drank of the brook, and preached in loving deed Good tidings to the poor. Then once again Fell darkness; prelates clutched the sword and purse Black with the ban of Christ, hid reason's star With smoke of reason's martyrs, turned the halls Of brethren bound in equal helpfulness To dens of harlots. They whose crippling toil Made sleek the lord, robbed of their wretched bread, To swell his pomp, ate grass and lay like swine; For him the court, the dance, the chase, the feast, The rape of maiden brides; for them the load Of hopeless days, the halter and the wheel. Dense was the night, and angry was the dawn; Fierce smote the day-star reason on the pride Of Pope and King;—it melted like the rime, And thought took wing once more. Then glared a noon Of terror, and the death-light of eclipse; And in that lurid gloom a nation strove Single against the world, and all the Earth Was shaken with the thunder of the strife. The would-be Cæsar fell, and night returned Haunted with echoes of old ruins fallen And fitful levin of the people's wrath. The promise of that dawn, “No more of chains! Brothers and equals all!” was born in blood; Blood ruled the day, and blood defiles the night; For in this lingering night, while louder swells The shout of revel and the roar of toil, While wail and threat of misery disturb The rich man's peace, and idle palaces Forbode the earthquake, while the nations groan Under their weight of armour—fools and knaves! We trample happiness, to clutch at gold Wrung from the slow starvation of the poor, Profess the Christ, and plead the plea of Cain, “Each brother for himself.” Night lingers yet; But darker hours have passed, and even now Faintly, but widely, glimmers the new dawn. We shall not see its glory, we who strive Sad-hearted in the spectral twilight, sick With long soul-hunger, weary to behold Greed seize his shivering prey, and in his web Mammon the subtle spider lurk, his paunch Swoll'n with the blood of bright and wingéd things. We shall not see the glittering halls of guile Totter, the homes of honest toil grow fair, The couch of selfish sloth become a bed Of loathing, and the labourer rise and shake The vampire off that sucks his weary veins; We shall not breathe the loftier purer air Of civic life, each emulous for all, And all for each, when none need strain or starve That some may surfeit, none be vilely clad That some may blaze with jewels, none be choked With highway dust that some may lightly toy In flowery glades of sweet unfruitfulness; When cities shall no more screen dens of slaves With bowers of indolence; but stately halls Of Art and Truth shall rise 'mid beauteous homes Of brethren banded for the common good, Faithful in toil and just in recompense, Simple of life and strenuous of soul, Through union strong and free through selfrestraint, A wiser, nobler, lovelier race than ours. It dawns, but ah! how slowly! and what clouds Of sloth and hate, of dullness, pride and greed, Obscure it from our sight!—Yet see! the hills Are crowned with splendour, and the wistful eyes Of them that watch thereon are full of fire. Children of light, arise!—the shadows flee, The daylight is at hand!—fulfil your dreams; Up to the hills and view the growing dawn! Your dreams have given it birth; see that it live; For ye are guardians of the day, its glow Springs from your hearts, defenders of the faith, Bright champions of the noble, just and true! Cry to the poor, “Ye shall not always pine In darkness, cold and hunger, while life's feast O'erflows for them who make their heaven your hell!” Cry to the drudge, “Thou shall not always rest The thing of scorn thy lord hath held thee, slow, Long-suffering, hard and stubborn as an ass, Stunted in soul and brutal in desire, Ill-fed, ill-housed, coarse-featured and coarsetongued.” Cry to their lords, “Ye have betrayed your trust, Put to base use your basely-gotten gains, Have lured the blind astray, enslaved the weak, And given their bread to rascals; ye were called To lead the world in loftier ways of life, And ye have served your bellies and become A byword and a blot; your days are told.” Cry to the bountiful, “Your wheat was sown 'Mid tares; one sickle reapeth all; fear not; The harvest will divide the tares and wheat; Blame not the reaper's hand; so suffered Christ.” Cry to the stubborn, “Tremble for your sons! On them you lay the burden of your debt; They shall redeem it; flatter not your pride; Redress is sure; only with you it lies Whether it come of reason or of wrath.” Cry to your loitering brothers, “Up! and join Our slender band, one day to be a host!” Take sword and shield; the powers of night are strong, The battle will be long and bitter; sound The clarion of your faith, “Christ lives, no more In shrines of stone, but in the hearts of men!” The wiser poor, the kindlier rich, will hear Your summons gladly; and the wavering throng, Catching amid a thousand doubtful cries One clear firm trumpet-call, at last will seek Your standard, and the victory will be yours. Sound an alarm! for many a waking soul Listens, while comfortable captains drone:— “Loud fools, that think to fashion gods of clay, Let be! ye vex yourselves in vain; the dawn Asks not your aid; ye cannot stay its course Nor hasten it one hour.”—Regard them not; Prophets of ease, ambassadors of sloth, Seducers of the soldiery of Heaven! They spake not thus, whose voices echo yet Across oblivion's widening domain, Those mighty marshals of the wars of old. Man's spacious evolutions on this world's Dim battlefield, where night contends with day, Spare not a soldier; each one doth his part To make or mar the triumph, and he thwarts Who helps not. None can watch the shifting lines, The headlong rout, the struggling hero-band, The heights now gained, now lost, 'mid curse and prayer, Wail of the wounded, silence of the slain, Himself unmoved, save Him who moveth all. Love's kingdom is not won by watching; Heaven Is slowly scaled by toil and tears and blood; The bonds that man hath woven man must rend, The wrongs that man hath suffered man must right, The hopes that man hath wrecked man must restore, Man's nobler order man himself must found. What though in bygone æons some vast power, We darkly name by the great name of God, Scattered the seed of systems through the void, Spake to them, “Thus and thus ye shall enfold,” And left them self-sufficient but foredoomed To one fixed course?—the destinies of man Revolve not as the planets round the sun, Move not to music of some distant sphere, But answer man's own impulse, and are ruled By human passion, pity, faith and love. The goal we cannot choose but reach, is seen By human hope and sought by human strength; The laws we cannot choose but own, are writ In human hearts, proclaimed by human wills; Fate's active servants, not her passive slaves. What though, engendered in Time's secret womb, The germ of all that man shall ever be Was quickened by the Maker and ordained To see the light with labour and with groans?— Yet knowledge can assuage the pangs, and skill Hasten the joyful birth. What though the world Untimely suffer many a spasm which fails And brings forth nought but sorrow?—every throe Hath yet its purpose, and unknown prepares The agony which yields the newborn life. The old world lieth quiet in its grave; Castle and abbey crumble, gently falls Decay's gray breath upon them, and the ivy Stealeth a silent triumph o'er their death; The new world striveth blindly to be born; The dungeon-bars are sundered, but the dens Where hirelings sweat dishonour frame and soul; The chains of steel are snapt, but weaker slaves Groan under stronger lords in chains of gold; The lance hath rusted, but the arm of wealth Wields mightier weapons, hunger, cold and shame; The Wonder-god departeth, but the faith That drave him forth hath fled the minster-walls And wanders outcast, homeless and forlorn; So, when his pity of the bruised and poor, His wrath against the proud, had won for Christ A felon's doom, the warders of his truth Spake not in temples rich with carven stone, With incense dim, and hallowed by the prayers Of ages, but proclaimed from meagre rooms The gospel that availed to cleanse the world; It hath its temples now; the faith to come Shall dwell therein when wider day prevails, A thousand dawn-hues blending in one light; And who shall say, when that bright dawn is seen As darkness, what transcendent noon of faith, Pure, open, boundless as the blue of heaven The future shall disclose? The nations writhe In travail, and a smothered moan is heard That shall become a mighty cry and shake Men's hearts with joy and horror of the birth. Slow is the labour, for the birth is great; Bitter the pangs and sick with baffled hope. A hundred years have pondered on the throes Of her whose haste proved hindrance, when the torch That Luther held to heaven, and Cromwell snatched To kindle a great people's zeal, inflamed A stormier neighbour, and the right of self, Unchained at last, amazed to feel its strength, Turned freedom into frenzy, and so wrought New shackles of the old. A score of years Unpondering have trampled on the sod Where sleep the soldier-craftsmen of the Seine, Untimely bold, whose battle-cry was yet The watchword of the future—“All for All.” Slow is the travail, and no child of ours Shall greet the newborn day; he shall but see The bosom of the nations heaving hard, Perchance some fierce convulsion that shall make All Christendom turn pale and gasp for breath, While year by year the rich shall grow more soft, The poor more stern, the strife for gain more wild, More hopeless; wealth shall league with wealth, and want Shall league with want, till that strange hour ascend, When one shall hold within a trembling palm The substance of ten thousand marshalled slaves, Each wiser, trustier, manlier than himself. Slow is the travail, but the birth is sure; Resistless forces muster; myriads aid The great deliverance, neither knowing it Nor willing; the rash strife of selfish aims Hath served to bind men closer, and beneath The tribulation of this pregnant age Is felt the throbbing of a nobler heart. The birth is sure. The pilgrimage of man Is toward his godhead; long the way and steep; And gazing on the heights that tower before He well may droop, but gazing on the plain Where once he trod, take heart. The World to Come, The Fellowship of Toil, the League of Right, The Reign of Love, the Commonwealth of Peace, Could scarce seem stranger to our eyes, than we To the wild naked race from whom we sprang. Man that shall be half-god was once half-beast; He ate his kind, he pierced the withered womb That bare him, flayed his foe and grinned to mark His dying torment. How might such as he Forebode an age to come, when man should spin Rock into less than gossamer, weigh the stars, Bridle the lightning, wield the thunderbolt, And bind a girdle round the loins of Earth; While Art should lift and Faith should fire the soul, And gentle hands should wait upon the sick, And all the tender charities of home Hallow man's life? Brutish and slow and few His purblind promptings; yet a root so base Hath borne at last such blossom; and shall we Who wear it, and who know the savage soil That nursed it, wring our hands because its thorns Are strong and cruel, crying, “Alas! in vain The warmer sun, the kindlier air; in vain We vex our richer clay; the seed we sow Will spring no quicklier than the seed of old, Will yield no fairer flowers than these we pluck With disenchanted hearts and bleeding hands?” None may peruse the book of things to be; But we, before whose eyes the fading Past Lies like an open scroll, may well divine, Reading the breathing records of our day, Some phrases of the page our sons shall write, Cancelled, confused, o'erwrit, its fairest words Blotted and blurred perchance with tears and blood, Yet bright with hope, and everywhere inscribed The watchword of the future, “All for All.” Man hath misused the powers a god might boast, Hath turned the ties of helpfulness to chains, And lord of wind and wave and fruitful field Is slave of greed, till now, ten thousand years Of conflict overpast, his millions dwell Less sweetly than the bird that year by year Sings as he builds amid the budding thorn. Ages of bitter penance must redeem His long transgressions and instruct him late To use his gifts aright; blood yet may flow In freedom's cause, as ofttimes blood hath flowed, But blood will ne'er cement with lasting strength The stronghold of our peace; it will not stand, Till conscience-struck the rich at last renounce Their deathful privilege of sloth and waste, The poor awake from stupor, and the light Of conscious power and hope illume their souls. Then shall its broad foundations rest on faith, Love shall combine its parts, and justice rear Its pillars, and all hands shall gladly join To stablish and adorn the home of all. Brothers in toil and triumph ye shall be, Bright children of the future! nevermore Hungry to plough that gluttony may reap, Naked to weave that vanity may wear, Homeless to build that idleness may lounge; No more to wallow in the mire that some May dally in the meadows; nevermore To stint the heart and starve the brain, that some, Your ceaseless sweat sustains, may mock your prayers, Sneering, “The swine would have us cast them pearls To trample.”—Courage, friends!—beneath the froth Of light and glittering wavelets, backward tossed By fashion's puffs, one all-embracing tide, Mighty as truth and deep as righteousness, Holds, inch by inch, its unrelenting way. Lo! how its sway advanceth! Wave on wave, Steady and buoyant with unfathomed depth, Hath rolled across the leagues of heaving grey, Hath risen and reeled and fallen, and seething dashed The rattling shingle up the shore, sucked back Only to speed the further. Many a year That flood hath rolled since when the German sage, His grave eyes warm with pity of the poor, Watched the yet ebbing tide, and them that left Their cabins 'neath the cliffs to pitch, with slow And bitter toil, beneath the lash of want, Pavilions on the sand, where Ease might sport Softly secure. He watched and groaned and spake;— “Weak thralls that toil, strong lords that rob and waste, It will not be for long; the tide will turn, And slowly flowing swallow with its surge Palace and hut alike that rest on sand; And naught shall last which human hands have reared, Till Justice build her temple on the rock.” So spake the seer; men stopped their ears and scoffed; But in these latter hours, while deep the dust Lies in his grave, along the wide world's marge, Distant and low, is heard the approaching roar Of overwhelming waves, till myriads now Unstop their ears, and harkening, some with fear And some with hope, confess the prophet's truth. Swiftly for many an age portentous powers Have leapt from darkness, urging unaware The tide of toil's redemption; for the wretch Who wandered naked, couched him with the wolf, And slew his sons to glut the fiend of storm, Now speeds through mountains, cleaves the hurricane, And speaks across the ocean; while his soul Mounts ever higher;—no longer brutes that snatch Their solitary prey, but kindred wills Combining widely for a common good; No longer slaves, branded and bowed and blind, Of lords that live by plunder of the poor, But freemen marshalled close and firm, to claim Through majesty of labour's calm revolt Salvation for their fellows, space to breathe, Light to rejoice in, time to muse and feel, And not by never-slackened strain to prove Unwilling thieves of one another's bread; Salvation for their masters, wholesome due Of daily toil, sound brain and honest heart, And not with jockey, drink and drab to spill The sacred gold which is the blood of men. Over the troubled waters of the world Broodeth a newborn spirit, that shall calm Their self-destructive conflict and call forth Order again from chaos. Far and wide Resounds the cry,—“Enough of self's mad fight, Enough of blaring each his brazen lie, Of hewing at our brethren in the dark, Of trampling on our allies in the rush; Let us be friends, and working with one will Possess the earth whereon we now but bleed!” So rings the cry;—and what though many a soul, Untouched by passion for the public weal, Swell it through guile or fearfulness or greed, Nursing some narrow end? What though the crowd, Unmindful of the cause that is mankind's, Bleat but as sheep that hear their flock-mates bleat?— 'Twas ever thus; the good cause basely served Is good no less; the oak-tree thriveth not By shower and sun alone, but by the blasts That shake its heart, and by the rotten mould Of its own leaves that falling feed its strength. The temple of the future hath its base Deep in the past; the master-builder, Time, Slow to upraise from naked wandering wights The tribe that owned one sire, from tribes the town, From towns the nation, and from these the race, Will found at last the Fellowship of Man. Shame on all hearts that feel, all souls that think, And hold this rich estate of life in trust, If careless of the increase yet to be, Forgetful of the increase that hath been, They idly eat of others' toil and so Renounce their stewardship! Shame on all eyes That read the record of man's uphill march Heavenward, from when he ate his kinsman's flesh Till when his spirit soared in flights of song, Surveyed the pathways of the stars and curbed The lightning for his courier—shame, if we, Who enter on such lordly heritage Of act and hope, fold idle arms and whine, “The world stands still; the wrongs our brethren bear Are cureless as old age; the crushing loads We bind upon the shoulders of the weak, The helpless girls on whom we wreak our lust, The little ones that starve to swell our feasts, Loud hawking of false wares, perpetual toll To him who toileth not from him who toils, The mill-horse round from dusk to dusk, till heart Shrinks, and the soul stagnates, and the brain throbs To the engine's pulse, and man becomes machine, The itch of greed, the haggard overstrain, The senseless rivalry of costly show, Stupor of ignorance and sloth and want, Fever of gaming, harlotry and drink— These things are everlasting; man hath learnt By sore experience much; but never hope, Fond dreamer, men will learn to cast the slough Of selfishness, or steadfastly to lead Righteous and watchful lives, or toil to enrich The common treasure-house and win for each His portion at the banquet spread for all.” Shame on the faithless ones who thus disown The promise of the past! The goal indeed Is distant; many an age must bleed and sob In greed's unthrifty fray, ere wisdom's light, So faint and fitful yet, illume the world, And men be schooled to help where now they hate. The goal is distant, and the straining limbs Of them whose eyes descry the promised land Will never rest within it;—but the hope, The striving, dies not with their dust; they send Their sons afield, lithe limbs and eyes of fire, Sound brains and hearts of sunshine, and they cry, “God speed the young! they start from where we sink; Bravely they run the race wherein we faint; Their breasts are heaving with our hopes, their feet Fledged with our conquests; and when age hath warped Their thews and chilled their veins, and when their eyes Swim, straining at the future, from behind They'll hear the rush of feet, and as they fall Gasp with their latest breath, ‘God speed the young!’” Yet ponder, ye who dream the reign of love, The coming Christ and Kingdom of his peace, Are nigh; Justice must first prepare the way, Or Love will trip; and Justice tarries long. Dulled with the long day's fight for meat and drink, The crowd are but as babes, that heed alone The wrong that pincheth their own flesh, the fear That knocketh at their own barred gate by night; Let lust and greed and malice wreak their worst, Let war and waste devour the garnered grain, Oppression stalk unchallenged, fraud grow fat, Perish the sun, moon, stars, yea! perish God, If but their cushioned cradle rock secure. Such are the crowd; howbeit the human bond Was ne'er so strong and ample, nor the lie Of Cain's lean creed so blank. From land to land Speeds lightning-winged each nation's joy and woe, A million brains quick with the selfsame thought, A million hearts hot with the selfsame hope, One mind, one soul, one purpose, and one law. The wide world trembles in her strength, aware Of some great doom impending; the old cry Of “King or People” faileth, the new cry Riseth of “Rich or Poor”; the slaves that tax Sinew and brain to feast an idle few, Bound in one league of patient self-control, Strong with the meat of wisdom slowly won, Bold with the wine of righteous discontent, Will one day hold of Mammon's stewardship A searching audit; slowly will redeem The monstrous debt which centuries of wrong Have heaped upon the poor, or with one stroke Cancel it evermore; will wisely change By just degrees the fashion of the scheme Of human toil and recompense, or stung By misery and maddened by disdain Shatter it with a blow—The rich may choose. No more the father of the church constrains The pride of wealth, the rage of lust; no more The priest, once champion of the people, curbs The gilded tyrant; and no power stands forth To play the umpire in the fierce free fight For gain, and summon with controlling word The struggling throngs to order; and no faith Of all men held inspires, no hope of Heaven Gladdens the heart of misery. The faith That fired all France, and glowed through half the world, A hundred years gone by, was strong to shake Old fabrics, but it founded not the new; Madly it flung the rusty forms of life, Sceptre and crest and crosier, into scorn's Fierce melting-pot, but the fresh shapes are yet Uncast, and slowly must the metal cool In firmer moulds of thought, ere once again Order and faith prevail. Liege-lord and serf Have yielded place in gain's ungoverned strife To millionaire and hireling, every man A law unto himself; these too shall yield, By slow advance of firmly-planted steps, To common labour for the common weal, Rich store and right award of honest wares, To common learning for the common good, To faith and hope and care of humankind, To larger aims and broader ways of life, Till “Each for Self” shall yield to “All for All.” A hundred years gone by, from shore to shore The Western deep resounded with the clang Of sundered chains; Britannia's eldest-born, The sturdy babe delivered from her loins In pangs of persecution and despair, Grown to a giant, cast indignantly The leading-strings aside that vexed its strength, And shouted “Freedom!”—France caught up the cry, And gave it tenfold breath, proclaimed for naught The chance of birth, the pride of place, and drew With fiery hand, and held to all the world, The charter of her faith, the Rights of Man. Kings trembled, nobles quaked, and priests turned pale; The powers of darkness gathered; host on host The thunder-clouds of battle rolled their gloom Toward that strange light, and like the levin's flash The sword of France leapt forth. Then gyves, that long Had galled and rusted, fell; prelate and lord Fled naked; thought and deed, till then held in By rotten reins, burst them and rioted Stark mad; and ere that lurid sun went down In reek of luxury, the wakened world Had welcomed a new gospel, “Off with chains! Free fight on a fair field, and devil take The vanquished!”—Good! so that the field be fair, So that the combatants be justly matched; Good!—and we bless the day that gave the West A spur so sharp; good!—but a better waits. What comfort to the millions who must sell Their toil for aught the hour affords, or starve, The chapman standing by with tongue in cheek Watching the teeming strife which works him wealth— What comfort that we dub the bargain free? Free as the brigand choice, “Your gold or life,” Free as the hounding of a naked horde By armed battalions. Little need to-day, Whate'er our grandsires' need, to preach the faith Of selfish claims; the nobler faith be ours Of civic duty, and the steadfast hope Of that good time when none shall gloat o'er gain Wrung from the helpless, but each man's desire Shall be the public weal, and all shall dwell In healthfulness of mutual toil and rest. Yet thank we gallant France, who singly bore The onset of the tyrants, leagued to quench The torch she held aloft to light the earth. Forgotten be her sins—mitre and crown Provoked them, and the red-cap's rapid axe Dealt gentler torture than the noble's wheel— Remembered only be her rich bequest Of reason to the nations; let all time Record beside the ruins she o'erthrew The monuments she reared, and how she waged Fierce but triumphant war with all that checked The flight of thought, and how her prophets heard Beyond the castle's doom, beyond the din Of Mammon's palace rising from its wrecks, The footfall of the serried ranks of toil, The murmur of the Commonwealth of Peace. “Away with lord and slave! be comrades all, Brothers and peers and freemen of one realm, Knit in one faith, advancing in one hope, Ruled by one law of labour, light and love!” So rang her clarion-call, startling the world. What though too soon the wrath of rival powers, The crash of cities and the war-bolt's scream Drowned that clear voice; what though the nations yet, Unmindful of the cause that is mankind's, Arm horribly in silence, and 'neath brows Burdened with care and darkened with distrust Glare upon one another?—the new Word, Announced in storm, inscribed in tears and blood, Will be fulfilled in peace; the dead leaf falls, The young bud gathers strength to burst its sheath, Not in wild nights alone, but genial hours Of showery sun and days of frosty calm. Firmly the people's master-hand doth mould The stubborn clay of custom to new shapes Befitting the new needs; slowly the sway Of force and fortune yieldeth to the sway Of thought and toil; and surely the grim fight For daily bread of those who would be friends, That rageth round the holds where age by age Mammon hath piled the plunder of the poor, Worketh the slave's salvation; stealthily Greed, trembling for the safety of his hoards, Heaps them in fewer strongholds; foes within Contrive their rivals' fall, and foes without, The hungry hosts that surge around the walls, Compass them ever closer; and more loud Than yell of hate, or groan of agony, Riseth the cry of hope,—“Comrades, be strong, Patient and bold and true; the better time Draws near, when they alone shall reap who till And sow and tend the harvests of the world, Not they who lounge and waste!” So rings the cry, The one heart-utterance heard in every land, The one clear message from the world to come; It soars above the rage of factious strife, The wrangling of the market and the courts, The wail of dying creeds and wandering calls Of marsh-light mystics, and will lead mankind, Obedient to his own unfolding law, Through many a slough, o'er many a stumbling-block, To righteous ways and plenteousness of peace. Closer and ever closer all that is Binds man to man; he cannot, if he would, Renounce his brother's charge, or tread alone The path of his own choosing; the old faith Departeth; the free fight of “Each for Self” Hath lost its fierce confusion, and in haste Rangeth itself in two vast leagues, of them That have, and them that have not; nor shall these Make common cause till o'er one mighty host Shall float one stainless ensign, “All for All.” Far off! and yet 'twill be! if not more soon, Yet not less surely than this anxious age Hath blossomed from the wildness of a past As base as we shall seem to eyes unborn. 'Twill be; the age of single aims will pass; The world-soul waketh; gambling-hell and stews, The worlding's palace and the wage-slave's den, Will fall and fade like evil dreams away; 'Twas not to reach a Heaven so low, that saints Have wrestled, poets sung and patriots bled; They toiled and suffered for a somewhat higher Than self, for that great Being which doth enfold The ages and endures beyond their death, In Whom we live and learn and ever move Onward, Whose sight is faith, Whose breath is hope, Whose dwelling is eternity, Whose power Is blended of all passions, thoughts and acts That spring from noble natures and achieve By slow degrees salvation for mankind. Our path is 'neath the storm-cloud; but thought mists Perplex and darkness daunt us, yet beyond The battling winds, the blindness of the bolt, The sobbing rack, is seen a glimpse of blue— The promise of a holier day than ours, The portals of the City of Content. Two thousand years have billowed o'er the day, Nor worn its deep inscription from Time's shore, When on a Grecian plain the powers of Night Were scattered and the shackles of the East Sundered for evermore; Freedom that day Received her charter, and the People's cause Blood-baptism, and the young West learned to soar Where yet she had but crawled, and sought and won The cloud-crowned heights, and made the chariot-wheels Of progress glow, till now at last she draws The laggard Orient in her train, and holds Upgathered in her hand, some dangling loose, Some tightly stretched, the reins of the whole world. The dead of night is past, but the new dawn Not yet hath roused the sluggard; Tyranny Hath doffed his robes for slumber, and no more Shall do them on; the rich young fool, made drunk With vanity and vice, securely dreams The wealth he never toiled an hour to win Is his for ever; swindler, niggard, churl Heavily breathe; but hark! what boding sound, A sound of limbs that stretch and breasts that sigh, Is heard the wide world o'er!—at last—oh! hour Long waited for by them that watched and strove— At last their ears have heard the trumpet-call, At last the light hath pierced those weary lids, At last the workers waken!—Tempt them not, Ye, whom their nakedness hath softly clothed, Ye, whom their slow starvation hath fed sleek; Sleep on, and let the hungry millions tramp Unchallenged past your tents; or, if ye wake, Out of their path, as o'er the Gallic bounds Your fathers fled; and see ye stand not by With listless smile or academic sneer To mock their rude requital; they have told Your lavish lusts and strictly reckoned up Your debt of folly; let them not require Of you the silver hairs their sires ne'er saw, Of you the bread their little ones have lacked, Of you the blood their simple sons have shed, Of you the honour from their daughters torn; Yield them thus late their own, the fields they till, The wealth their toil hath fashioned; and thereto Add fervent thanks if haply they should spare To claim arrears, if haply in some hour Of generous triumph they should reach the hand Of fellowship to all men—even you. But if with stubborn dullness ye should baulk Their progress, and the billows of their might Thwarted in vain should rise and overleap All natural bounds, devouring in blind haste Evil and good alike, forgetting him That wisely put his wealth to noble use And left his ease and joy to serve the poor, Remembering only the fat drones that filch The gathered honey of the human hive And scorn the work-bees—can ye blame their wrath That pauseth not to winnow? Hath your caste So singled out, when time and chance were theirs, From the rough ranks of toil the man whose soul Was as a lamp, dusty and soiled, yet lit From the great Sun, or hath it stolen the light And trampled on the lantern?—dare ye say?— Howbeit when those seventimes beleagured walls Fell to the trumpet-summons seventimes blown Of Israel's captain, she whose casement showed The scarlet thread, one friend amid the foe, Was rescued, when the conquering hosts poured in, For one good service, she and all her house. Therefore be wise in time, and have a care By large endeavour for the public good To turn the blade of vengeance, and make smooth The path of peaceful conquest for the hosts That thunder at your city gates; take heed To shed abroad the truth ye cannot quench, Lest light turn lightning; flatter not your souls; Ye hear afar the murmur of the flood; There yet is time; but if ye stop your ears, And cry, as cried the loathsome king, whose breath Poisoned the air of France, “Let the cup's chink, Loud folly, and the laughter of bought love, Drown yon low menace; give us leave to sleep And sin away the remnant of our days On beds of ease; then let the deluge come!”— If thus ye hug your comfort, your sons' blood Be on your heads, haply your own blood too! Haply the rotten dykes will not outlast Your own poor shred of life; the suffering throngs Grow shrewd, and will not evermore endure To clench the idle hands that fain would toil, To meet the mother's piteous eyes, and watch The silent children gaunt with stint and cold Huddle their rags around them, while the lord Who boasts the land his own whereon they pine, The gamester of the mart who wrings close rent For dens where rats would sicken, the wage-monger, Whose ground of vantage is the wage-slave's need, Wastes on his cook the gold that would have fed A score of craftsmen, while his brainless heir Squanders among the rascals of the ring A city's revenue. The men who pay With brain and thew forced tribute unto such, The men who feed and clothe and deck the world, The jaded hacks of labour, busy-blind, Will pause some day, and stand with folded arms, Waiting amid the silence of the wheels Till right be done; nor will they wait in vain; The people's cause is just, and late or soon Will triumph; slowly dawns, through slavehood's night, The quickening truth that all who sweat for hire, With thew or brain, are brothers in one bond, Seared with one brand, bowed down beneath one yoke, Wistful with one dumb hope which stammers now Toward utterance, troubled with one blind desire For better things. Their cravings shall not rest For ever unappeased; closer each day Toil's dense battalions muster, and their foes, Foreboding the long fight of rich and poor, Would sound a parley, learning wisdom late. The issue who can doubt?—If thought and toil Make strong, if vice and indolence make weak, If justice, truth and honour be not dreams, The wrong will cease, the nobler day will dawn. A day of world-wide peace and rich content, Of rightly portioned toil and due repose, Of honest comradeship whose “mine” and “thine” Waiteth on “ours,” of knowledge freely shed, And wide communion of awakened souls, Of simple manners flowering from one field Where common work makes common wealth—that day Will surely dawn and cast athwart the world Shadows to us unknown; new sun, new shade. And oft the spirit questions if man's life Holdeth more joy to-day than when he ranged A hunter o'er the wastes that knew no lord, And flushed with chase and breeze and sunshine caught The wild maid by the hair, and made her his In lawless solitudes, and thought no wrong. Soul-sickness was not then, nor doubt's lone chill; The strain of living dulled not life's keen edge; Loss tore no heart; death was a wayside thing Scarce heeded; and the savage, if he lacked Our costly heritage of art and thought, Yet knew not what it is to hear the clod Knell on the coffin where some brain that burned With youthful ecstasy lies cold, and feel The world within one sob, the world without One hungry void. Therefore what profits it To banish grosser forms of want and woe, If finer spirits suffer finer pains, If crime but yield to subtler shades of sin, And evil's sum abideth? What avails The conflict, toil, and patience, if the end Be only loftier heaven and deeper hell, Not that good time we seek? The promised land Is ever on the verge; yet, laugh or weep, We cannot choose but seek it; and the speed Makes our hearts bound and fills our lungs with life; And as we journey on, sunshine and cloud Will smile and frown more evenly, and men Breathing one air, illumined with one light, Will hold each other dearer; and the best Of joys, the joy that knoweth not remorse, The fellowship of kindred souls, will spread O'er the glad earth like common flowers of Spring. Such fellowship we know not; for what help, What common hope or joy, can knit the heart Of him whose life is one stern fight for bread To him whose only care is how to tempt His jaded appetites, can win the love Of her who nightly sews herself a shroud For her whose gravest thought is how to deck Her dainty charms anew?—The selfsame wrong That starves the poor man's soul sickens the rich With surfeit, and dismays the heart of them Whose modest portion seems now lavish waste, Now penury. The goal whereto we press, The far-off fellowship of quickened souls, Is past our ken; nor will the eyes of man Behold it till the fruits of all men's toil Are shared aright; till none are bowed like beasts By ceaseless strain, but truth and art have blest Each cradle; till the holds of selfish pride Are levelled, and the wise and good alone Are held in worship; till by dint of pain Mankind hath learned 'tis better and more sweet To serve than rob and wrangle, and the temple Reared by all hands is nobler than a batch Of paltry huts. But till that bright day dawn, Alas! how long! And oft in darker hours Weary we ask, “What profits all our care? So dull and slow the crowd; so deep the chasm Dividing churl from gentle; the gross beast— Slave of the prize-ring, gambling-hell and stews— From Thought's throned kings; the hag who lays her snare For maidens' feet, from the pure ministrant By dying beds; so loudly roars the mob Of sluggards, fools and cheats; so dimly shines The lamp of truth and virtue through the gloom; So slowly through the generations' veins Pulses the nobler blood; so light the leaven, So huge the lump—a soul that thinks and feels Were best outside the turmoil; life is sweet In the calm shelter of a cultured home; The friendly hearth, the love of wife and child Close commune with the teachers of all time, Deep drinking at the deathless founts of song The care of flowers and fruit, the master-strains Of harmony, the stately walks of art, The wonderland of science—these suffice; And sweet to wander through this English land, By mead and orchard, copse and old-world grange Lulled by the song of brook and bird and bee; And sweet to watch the pale green moon of May Rise o'er the tender larch-wood, silvering slow, While dies the throstle's song, and the faint scent Of young leaves after showers fills all the soul With longing for some delicate romance, That like the horizon's dreamland evermore Eludes embrace.”—Ah! we could dwell at ease In life's fair upper chambers, could rejoice In life's continual music, conscience-free, But that the same fine sense, which apprehends Each subtlest note in her rich symphonies, Hears, saddening all, a dreary undertone, The sigh of them that surfeit wearily, The wail of them that daily build and tend The palace of our joy, but when we feast Lie cowering in its dungeons; we could keep Delicious revel with the shapes that haunt Soul-slumber, but that ever and anon Some ghastly scene of want or waste or greed, Some wretch that slays her infant for the gold Wherewith to drug her misery, some villain, Falser than fox and earthlier than hog, Who cheats the poor to roll in costly filth, Bursts through the lovely texture of our dream And wakes each honest passion; and we call On all who hold by justice, truth and love, To quit for one short breathing-space the roar That drowns the single voice, join hands, and take This simple oath, and teach it to their sons, “Never through grief or joy to flinch or flag Till right prevail, till all men justly share The sweet and plenteous fruit of all men's toil, Till knowledge, art and gladness be as free As sunlight, and the gulf 'twixt lord and slave, The coarse and fine of manners, garb and speech, Sunder our lives no more”—this oath to take, Then back into the tumult and the wrong, And mend it in God's name! 'Tis not enough To till our little plot, to greet our friends, To purge our flesh and feed our soul—to play, How graciously soever, with the life That is the curse of thousands. None can live Unto himself and sin not; help he must, Or hinder, man's salvation; and what spirit So mean as his who, when his brother groans, Mutters, “I harm thee not; my dream is good,” And turns again to drowse? Awake, awake! Ye that have brains to ponder, hearts to feel, And hands to help!—awake, and let your dreams Melt as the morning mists; gird on your swords And forward! linger not; your time is short, The march is long and toilsome; greater need That ye, who are the vanguard of the host, Should strike your tents betimes; and never doubt That Man will some day reach the land he seeks, Nor deem, because your path is dark and steep, Beset with foes and pitfalls, the great name, Unknown of old, whereby the ages move In steadfast order, marshalled by one law— The mighty name of Progress—a vain sound. Not all man's pride, unwisdom, sloth and sin Can stay mankind's advance; the tyrant's scourge Doth but unsheathe the patriot's sword; and Greed Grasps at his own destruction. The old days Are gone, when solitary nations grew, Flourished and fell like desert palms; when she, Even she who taught the West to build and rule, And well-nigh knit the ancient world in one, Could shake it with her downfall, and no sound Startle that undiscovered world to come, Where but the red-skin roamed. Man made not then The hemispheres his pleasure-ground, nor raced The blasts from shore to shore, nor flashed each hour The lightning message of his weal or woe A thousand leagues through voiceless depths of sea; The poet's word, the thinker's scheme, the strain, Past speech, past thought, of Music's mighty sons, Thrilled not through all the nations till they grew The heirloom of mankind; but every realm, The lordliest and the wisest of old days, Lived to itself alone, and so decayed. The doom is changed; Science and Art and Trade, Yea, War herself, have woven round the world A web so strong and subtle, that the lands Are veined and nerved to one great heart and brain, Are limbs of one World-being, and the wrong That grieveth each becomes the wrong of all. No more we lead the narrow single life; The globe is now our storehouse; day by day We steep the leaf and berry of the East, We reap the golden harvest of the West, We greet our kin who dwell three thousand leagues Beneath us. Broadly Progress plants her feet, Stumble she may, but naught can hold her steps, Till that far land, the glory of whose light Glows in her eyes, be reached, where none shall eat Who labour not, where just award of toil Shall win for all repose and joy, where greed Shall bow the neck to help, and strife at last Shall turn to peace, and wrong to righteousness. And murmur not if they, who hold this faith, Seem to the crowd, that deem the age they see The pattern of all ages yet to come, Dreamers;—so be it;—the temple of mankind Is reared by them that toil and fight and die For noble dreams, not them that yawn and sneer. Hated, derided, trampled by the feet Of hurrying throngs, spurned by the hoof of fools, Tortured and starved and slain, but at the last, When all he loved is unto him no more, Believed and reverenced—the dreamer knows And seeks his doom, but sees beyond all clouds The eternal sun, and feels within his soul The secret pulse of everlasting life. Forward!—what matters self, if but one spark, Quenchless throughout the ages, help to kindle The beacon-fire of truth, or light those souls, Still brooding o'er the ashes of the past, With flame from a new Heaven? What matters scorn, Sorrow or death, if but our brothers learn To quit the couch of pride and sloth and shame And draw the sword of right, our sisters learn To kiss no more the wounds of a dead Christ But speed his second coming?—One by one The weak waves leap and dash their troubled breasts To pieces with a moan upon the rocks— And yet the ocean conquers. Courage, friends! We stand as on a summer night when long The sun has set, and mark the deathly pallor Still lingering o'er his grave, and half forget That there the newborn day will rise—but see! The dubious dusk, that wraps all thought and deed, Wherein we grope and stumble and lament, Is yielding to a steadier light, and they That watch upon the peaks have seen afar The gleam of a new dawn; portentous clouds Roll thither, and the powers of gloom would quench The promise of its glory; hues of blood Flush all its brow with wrath, but swiftly fade, And tenderer tones prevailing shed their glow Wide o'er the gladsome earth, and evermore Increase in power and warmth and loveliness, Till emerald, sapphire, ruby, gold and pearl Are blent in one clear diamond of the day. Canto II Are we but babes, that, meeting Mother Truth In strange attire, we bellow first our fear, Next timidly draw near her, lastly crow Ecstatic credence, till some newer garb Fright us; or own we Nature's kindly care, That lets the sere leaf shield the tender bud, Till the young life hath gathered strength to thrust The old life aside?—When he, who late descried The slowly sure unfolding of all germs Of being, proclaimed the now unchallenged law, Fools scoffed, priests shrieked, and good men shook their heads; “A blind black mole, that burrows in the soil, And sees not his snout's length, would sap forsooth The very citadel of God.”—So now, When heralds of the wondrous change to come O'er toil's wide world announce the gradual dawn Of justice and the slow redress of wrong, The piercing of thick darkness by thought's lamp, The melting of old icefields by love's sun, The ceaseless long ascent from savage greed To full community of lofty aims,— No more the wild-beast impulse, “Clutch who can,” But in the mart and street the self-same law That blesseth home, the rule of “All for All”— When thus our seers foretell, the jostling crowd, Blind with the dust, deaf with the din of toil, Revile them, “Fools and rogues! that think to shake Wealth's firm foundations, build of common clay A pleasure-house for all, and people it With angels!” Thus the crowd.—But they who know That every bud will blossom in its hour Can wait for springtime calmly. The base strife That rageth in the market-place is seen To winnow grain from chaff, the man of might From weaklings; and the chaff, fools take for grain, The loud-lunged trumpeter of lying wares, The cunning spoiler of toil's simple slaves, The idler who grows sleek while labour starves, A mightier fan—the people's righteous wrath— Will some day scatter. But a nobler strife, That ceaseth not when other battles fail, Prepares a holier conquest;—bruised and worn, But vanquished never, wresting evermore Their fencéd places from the powers of gloom That slay themselves, the soldiers of the light Hold undismayed their course. Hope fires their eyes, Faith nerves their heart, and love makes strong their arm; Their very foes applaud them, after death Hath sheathed their sword, and rally round the flag Once mocked and trampled; and each age shall see The muster-roll of dull and sordid souls Dwindle, of lofty souls and wise and true Swell evermore, till selfish cunning yield To social truth, and darkness unto day. Growth governs all things; and the headlong rush, The conflict and the eddyings of life's stream, Are but as sap that frames and feeds new forms Still to unfold; not virtue's self abides Constant; to let their vengeance fall asleep— Christ's law—his fierce forefathers held a sin; To rend the nerves and roast the limbs of them That caught and clasped a purer truth, seemed once God's bidding; and an hour will surely rise When the gross blots that yet defile man's life Will fade; when they whose fathers thought no shame To gloat o'er others' ills, and harboured dwarfs To mock at, will as soon deny their guest His portion at their feast and snatch at all That hand can reach, as round the board of life Shoulder their neighbours from the common store Like hogs around a trough; will rather choose To trample down a cripple in a throng, Than make the helpless hunger of the poor A vantage-ground to rob them; rather dare To slay by force a feebler than themselves, As in old days, and batten on the spoil, Than squander in vain show the garnered fruits Of others' care, and watch their brethren strain Joyless and hopeless through the unvarying days, That they may riot. Such growth will come to light; And coin which passeth current in our streets Will then be deemed base metal. That calm seer, Who widest hath unfolded the great scroll Of human doom, foretelleth a far day When Nature, careful evermore to guard, Through mother, lover, patriot, martyr, saint, The unselfish type, will yield from these at last Love's triumph and the Polity of Peace. Fitness alone surviveth; ay! but who Shall gauge the fitness,—God or Devil?—Fit To tear at one another's throats? Or fit To wisely rule this world of tooth and claw, Which yet is man's high empire, wherein claws Have sheaths, and teeth have lips to smile and kiss, And help o'ermasters hate?—To sway such world Not they are fit who grasp and waste, but they Whom Greed itself, while mocking with its mouth, Worships at heart,—the generous, just and true, The scorners of all base pursuit of gain, The lovers of all things that lift the soul, The loyal to their city and their land; These shall abide, the others pass away; These—for the world around him, moulding man, Is by man moulded—shall possess the earth, Shall fashion it, from age to age, anew, Begetting still of goodlier heritage Yet goodlier heirs; shall slowly wean Mankind From Strife's dry, bitter breasts, to feed and smile Upon the bounteous bosom of sweet Peace. Nor only through dominion of high souls Is toil's release accomplished; Avarice Weaves unaware his winding-sheet; in vain The profit-monger wringeth the last drop From the pinched toiler's heart, in vain would rend His victim, like a beast of prey, unwatched; His hungrier rivals scent the spoil, and some With roar and leap, some crawling like a cat, Snatch at it piecemeal, and when all is gulped Prowl o'er the blood-stained spot, their green eyes slant With envy and mistrust, unsatisfied; Till now they take late counsel, and henceforth Would hunt in packs but eat in solitude The portioned quarry. It will not be; their prey Have learnt like cunning, and from far and near Compass with ordered hosts the scattering gangs Of seekers after spoil, and will not blench Till all the field be theirs. 'Tis done—What then? When the long strife is over, when the gulf 'Twixt rich and poor is filled, when each pursues, Obedient to self-love, his brother's good, And “All for All” is sovereign—what remains To hope and toil for?—Fear not; heights beyond Our short horizon then will tower afar, Tempting to effort; scarcely hath man spelt Through nature's alphabet, whose magic book Holds in each word a universe; scarce kissed The hem of art's rich robe, and scarce explored A single creek of music's welling stream, That whispers now along the reeds, now laughs O'er pebbly beds, now roars below the rocks, And lastly flows, a broad majestic flood, Bearing the souls of millions with its tide, Into the main of song.—'Tis much, that now, Even in these murky days of greed and want, Beauty hath smiled and wisdom turned her lamp On thousands, where till late all things were dark. 'Tis somewhat—and the commune of such souls Is life's best boon;—but when the promised sun Hath risen, and equal laws and manners shed Their genial influence o'er the minds of men, Growths sweet and strange shall flourish, blossomings Undreamt-of deck the highways hateful now With tumult, dust and blood; and human souls Shall know an intercourse more wide and free, More lofty, true and delicate, than aught Our dullness can imagine; genius then Shall burst its chains; no longer shall bare want Turn men to beasts, the sordid strife for gain Shrivel and starve the soul, nor idle riches Gorge it to slumber; Fortune's foolish sons Shall lift no more a languid brow of scorn, Nor lackeys do them worship; but each man Shall move amidst his peers, and frankly meet His neighbour's gaze, and find him, not as now In guise and bearing, thought, desire and speech An alien, but a fellow. Fancy then Shall browse at large, wisdom enrich her store Ten thousandfold; art, like the gladsome sun Revealing, through the gray, heaven's boundless blue And earth's fair shapes and tints, shall mount her throne, Scatter night's sullen clouds, and light the world; And music, like the common flood of life, Well in the hearts of all men. But till then, Alas! how long! What mountains to remove Of wretchedness and pride! Through what dense thickets Of tangled ignorance to hew a way! What barren wastes of sloth, what rocky wilds Of crime and madness, what death-reeking swamps Of lust, what sloughs of sottish selfishness To traverse, ere the land of hope be won!— Little it serves that he, who, dawn to dark, Is bondslave to the lords of soil and steam, Chinketh more pence, to flatter his dull brain With tavern fumes, than his poor sire could count, Dying a young-old man in sterner days When war made bread a dainty; little it serves If, while the drudge starves seldomer, his lord Heapeth from others' patient servitude A pile of gain, that viewed in hungrier times Had seemed a kingdom's ransom;—the deep chasm Yawns ever deeper; the rich man knoweth not The bitterness that gnaws the poor man's heart, Nor he the other's loathing, but each dwells In thought and speech, desire and deed, apart; Where faith should be, distrust; where mutual help, An ever-widening conflict; little serves A fuller belly for the slaves of toil, A vaster luxury for the lords of wage, If that for which alone all gold is gain— The free and equal fellowship of souls— Be not a whit the nearer. Light is good— And blesséd be the bravely wise, whose names Are beacons for all time, who suffered scorn, Torture and death, rather than quench the spark That burned within them—light is good—and well That science scanneth all things, that those dens Where reverend goblins lurked are merry now With children's laughter—but not light alone Can guide the erring steps of man aright, Or heal the hurts of ages. Fain would France, In that fierce glare which flashed along the world A hundred years gone by, have spread her wings, And clutching all the West with eagle claws Have soared to Heaven on one broad beam of light. Alas! the wings were glorious, but the claws Were claws of prey; and that whereon they seized Was solid flesh and dragged her down to earth. Not darkness only hinders; Truth's worst foes Bask in full sunshine—Indolence, that lies With nerveless limbs and half-closed lids, and gapes At the blue main above him, where the clouds Set their white sails and chase their snowy sisters, Majestically slow; Pride, with firm foot That pauseth where his shallow eyes may greet His image in the stagnant pool; old Custom, That grazeth without pause in sheltered croft Where grass is deep, and with a paunch well filled Settles his heavy bones, and hour by hour Cheweth the cud untroubled; Jealousy, Lean-cheeked, slant-eyed, whose hunger grows more fierce By feeding; Lust, with trembling hand, that clutches The crystal cup wherein the wine of life Sparkles, and breaks the cup, and wastes the wine; Greed, whose small eyes survey his bloated form And rest content—such are the foes of Truth. And Truth's defenders, who for her pure sake Renounce their ease, forget their pride, forego Tradition's downhill slope, abandon fame, Bridle each lust, and serve not their own good, But single-hearted live and die for Truth— How few! and through what struggles, wounds and tears, What pitfalls scarce escaped, what lonely hours Of failure and mistrust, they keep their faith. The same clear light, that beaming from their souls Shines on the land of hope and leads them on, Reveals the unheeded snares and stumbling-blocks That baulk the feet of Progress, bids them teach Their eager hearts the unregarded law, That only by one all-accordant will A host can march in order, and each foot That trips delayeth all; too well they know, The nobler order will not come to pass, Nor, founded, will endure, till age on age Of pain's strict schooling soundly hath informed The minds and hearts of all men; till strife cease, Till every frame be strong and beautiful And every soul be true; and since but few Of many paths, that part along the road Where darkling man doth grope his dubious way, Lead to the realm of righteousness—nor these The smoothest—many a wrongful age must pass, Ere from the loins of them who wander now From virtue's way, and lured by marsh-lights sink In sin's contagious slough, is born a race That walks aright as surely as the flower Turns to the loving sun. How long to wait Till that full day, the wisely-good best know; And they who hold their lives in constant pledge To speed its rising, need not faith alone, But strength to plough the trodden ground of Use, Courage to sow the seed 'mid storm and gloom, Patience to wait its growth, and at the last Contentment to reap little. Well may he Endure with joy the martyr's pains, who cheered And blinded by hope's dazzling beams expects A quick and plenteous harvest; but foreseeing The glory of a future which his eyes Shall ne'er behold, and knowing with what slow And ceaseless pains the tillage yieldeth fruit, How distant the due season, and how weak The mightiest striving of a single age To foster good—this knowing, yet to ply With warm and steadfast will his thankless task— This marks the hero; and the faith of such Assures its own fulfilment Forward! then, With courage, but with patience, sons of light! Firmly but slowly let your footfall sound; And while your brows are lifted to the heavens, See that your steps be sure, your course be straight, And while your standard presseth to the van, Remember still the rear, and hold your ranks. Ye shall not reach the promised land alone, But one and all; the world's old footsores first Must heal, the foul be pure, the false be true, The churl be kind, the drunkard reel no more, The brute be tamed, the bigot raise his lids, The dreamer wake, before those city gates Open, where neither lord nor slave abides, But freemen only. Not the subtlest scheme Contrived by all the wisest of this world Can shape the course of things; the good will grow Its own dark way; we can but watch and tend Its slow increase, and tending heedlessly May check it, and uprooting some rank weed May tear the fibres searching through the soil Where evil feeds with good. Howbeit, to tend The slow and secret growth of good aright Craves no unworthy husbandman; the clay Is heavy, and the field is thick with tares; Shod must he be with patience, robed with truth, Discreet of purpose, diligent of hand, And in his heart—as in the heart of that Strong singer who foretold 'mid Israel's woes The kingdom of her peace—must ever glow The vision of the labourer's recompense, The golden glory of the harvest-home. There was an age, whose records rudely graven Are wellnigh worn away, when bulk and thews Alone were sovereign, and the large of limb Trod down the slight, as some huge river-horse Tramples the reeds beside an Afric lake— An age of dwarfs and giants. Slowly forth From that gross gloom a gleam of cunning broke— The weakling's weapon—and from more to more Grew, till the strong were fain to learn its use. Lastly, than force and cunning mightier far, The power of fancy rose; in weight of limb The desert brute o'ermasters man, in skill The spider may perplex him, or the bee, The pinion of the soul is man's alone; And urged on fancy's wing, reason hath sought, Espied and won new empires, till man's spirit Mounts like an eagle, every beat of wing Revealing vaster prospects, and yet soars, Amazed at the wide wonder of the world. Time hath unclasped his volume to our gaze; Spellbound we scan those pages which the Past Hath hallowed with its finger, and we see A mellower glory flush them than the light Which glares upon our page; but when the hopes, The strivings and the triumphs that we know, Are gray, no page will seem to after men More fraught with majesty and high romance Than that which beareth witness of our day. Lords of the waves, compellers of the winds, The common usage of our life outstrips The wizard's wildest dream; Nature herself Hath done us homage, and the deeps of space Disclose to us their secrets; we have made The thunderbolt our minister, and hold The powers of flame in leash; our fiery steeds Ascend the mountain-side, and on those heights, Where clogged with snow earth's proudest soldier crept, Rush snorting through the rock. With awestruck eyes The simple Eastern mariners of old, Coasting along their tideless sea, beheld Long billows from an undiscovered world Roll slowly in, and, where the god of strength Had fixed his pillars, leap against the rocks, Bound thundering back, and waste themselves in foam. The baffled East withdrew, but lent the West Her balanced needle trembling toward the pole, Pilot, o'er pathless wastes of wave and wind, To that vast ocean-mainland where a man Might hold his faith untroubled by the frown Of pope or king. Through many a changeful age The white-winged messengers of war and peace Traversed that mighty solitude, till now Our prows of steel each hour 'gainst storm and tide Cleave their appointed way, and the twin wires Flash at a kiss the tidings of our weal 'Neath twice three hundred leagues of restless brine; They lie—those sister threads that link in one The Old World and the New World—where no light Nor sound nor motion liveth, mantled o'er With finest snow of shells, so delicate, A breath would crush their fabric; overhead The blasts do battle, and the writhing clouds Weep with the waves. The levin's rage is tamed To light our midnight musings and give back Forgotten accents of the mouldered dead; The sun is made our limner, and the stars Reveal their unseen splendours unto eyes By man contrived, that see where man is blind. We watch the shapeless embryos of systems Fashion themselves in the vast womb of space, We see the gnat's heart beat, and 'neath our lens The water-drop becomes a peopled realm. The loom whereon the weaver slowly wrought His simple web has grown a living thing; We give the word, and lo! the shuttle flies Unerring, while deft fingers of bright steel Catch at the threads and weave a damask sheen Subtler than winter's handiwork. The blind Receive their sight; the days of man increase; The knife hath lost its terrors, and performs Its office calmly, while the sufferer lies In merciful oblivion; the dark laws Of birth and death are searched. Thought, free as light, Enters at last the hovel; they who drudge, From dawn to dusk, forgather in the dark, Look in each other's eyes and find a soul, That long time flickering soon will burst in flame; A silence holds the hosts of toil, like that Strange silence, broken here and there with sobs, Which fell upon the negro in the night That saw his slavehood ended; dumb he knelt, Trembling to take possession of his life, Till midnight's last stroke, and the sudden day Of heaven's white fire-flash, and the salvo-peal Of thunder echoing through the fateful night, Proclaimed him slave no more. Even such a spell Holds labour's troubled legions; but they wait A like deliverance, and fulfilled at last With one strong pulse of common grief and hope Beckon to one another o'er the seas; Hunger and cold and darkness have not quenched Their spirit quite. With all its wrongs and woes, This age of iron is the age of thought, This age of labour is the age of love. 'Tis somewhat that our stature hath outgrown The mail our fathers wore, that week by week A thousand bloodless battles on the sward Tighten the thews and purge the blood of youth And drill the civic spirit; and glad of cheer We mark the lamp of learning more and more Make the dark places light and waken souls; But chiefly we give thanks that man hath caught, Even in the midst of greed's inglorious fray, Clear glimpses of a nobler life, and sees The hunger after righteousness and truth Plead in his brother's eyes, and grasps his hand, And cries, “Thy cause is mine.” Our laws are cast In larger moulds, no longer shaped to please A tyrant's humour or a prelate's pride, But fashioned by the people's sovereign will; And that which, voicing forth men's dumb desires And formless thought, is mother of all laws— The poet's word—no longer adulates From taverns, loud with cackling wits, the rich, But communes in sincerity of soul With nature's heart and man's; no longer struts In wig and lace, sham of a sham, but breathes, In music broad and free as ocean's roll, The mighty yearnings of this wonder-age. Firmly the people's wider grasp doth seize The heaped-up measure of the nation's wealth And shake it slowly level; toil and rest And health and joy shall be in days to come Common to all as sunshine; stumbling-blocks, That evil men or dull have set or left To trip their brethren's feet, the wise and good Still gathering strength will one day overcome; And natural ills, birth-stains of frame and soul, Nature herself—who mother-like chastiseth The child that spurns her laws, but mother-like, If he repent, kisseth the smart away— Will surely cure, if but we thwart her not. We shall not hear the triumph-song resound In that sweet city of peace, nor our sons' sons Shall view its stately splendours—for the world Is younger far than old—but blind is he Who deemeth not this age of vast design, Of snapping chains and soaring thought, the prince Of all the ages past; and base is he Who takes no joy, forecasting how the page That tells our tale will some day thrill the souls Of happier men redeemed through our distress. Therefore we lose not heart, but ever press Forward, remembering that the lordliest tree Was once a seed and thrust through stubborn soil A pair of pallid leaflets toward the light; Remembering how each unfamiliar good, Which braveth frost and tempest now, will grow Old in its turn, and when its wholesome strength Is wasted and decayed, how they will most Uphold its age whose fathers hindered most The promise of its youth; knowing that heights We vainly strive to scale will yet become Highways. And though the slow advance of things, Like some broad-moving flood, seemeth at times To lose all patience, and with rush and roar Take at a leap the precipice and ride Triumphing over shoal and rock and bank, We rather trudge than hasten, wotting well That only after many an angry bar, And many a tedious bend, the stream of time Will smoothly widen to the wished-for sea. Too well, alas! we know the goodliest husk Of civic rule is bootless, if the core Of private life be foul; yet tainted rind Makes rotten fruit. We seek no single cure For Earth's ten thousand evils; yet disease Heals not itself unhelped. We know, the road That leads to Heaven is dusty, steep and long; More need to start betimes. Sadly we own That Freedom's feet are blood-stained, and her eyes Ablaze with frenzy; yet her soul is pure. And like the sage who penned, when the red storm Of France was at its fiercest, that calm page Of mankind's heavenward march, we cheerly say, “The sky is overcast, the thunder-god Musters his sullen squadrons; but these melt; The blue abides.” The order we foretell Is no raw scheme conceived in solitude 'Twixt woe and envy, but a gradual growth, Sown by experience, planted in the past, As labour wide, as hunger sure, and strong As help itself; no system of the schools, But a world-force. We boast not to discern Each aspect of the changes it shall bring O'er man's wide workfield—toil through law set free, Greed's tumult ended, beauty's face unveiled;— Nor were they proven liars, who first proclaimed The reign of steam, because they laid not down The limits of its kingdom, imaged not The rushing of our iron steeds by night, Their white manes flaming while the riven rocks And sleeping towns crash past them, and heard not The hammer's mighty thud, that yet can crack The wren's egg and not crush it, our sea-giants Plunging through storm and darkness undismayed, Or watched the ceaseless whirring of the wheels Yield wealth ten thousandfold.—So we who preach The mighty power of union take no shame To own the prospect of the world to come Hidden from keenest vision, but with clouds Of glory. We foretell a newborn age, Begotten in the shadows of the Past, Long nurtured in the secret womb of Time, The hour of whose deliverance draweth nigh In pangs and groans, perchance in wrath and blood; Yet birth is but the promise of a life, Not life itself; and that which sudden throes Have brought to light, slow years of patient care Must perfect. The quick beat of Freedom's wings Is heard as clearly by the ears that dread As by the ears that hail it; and the sceptre, Wrenched from oppression's clutch, the people's hand Shall grasp with clearer wisdom, calmer will, Shall ever wield more widely, till at last Earth's fruitful workfields and fair pleasure-grounds, Where age by age the poor have slowly shed, To cloy a few, their bitter sweat and blood, Shall be their own dominion. Glebe and gold, The pastures and storehouses of mankind, Won in past ages, when the single arm Sufficed, by lords who proved themselves in might Best of their race, feed oft the sloth and pride Of weaklings, fools and lechers, while the poor, How wise or true or strong soe'er, are caught In a tight snare of tangled circumstance, Where struggling only maimeth. But the curse Shall not endure; the workers wake, and learn That single strands, a child might snap, can twine To cables; they shall weave a stronger bond Than aught their lords have woven, they shall wind Its coils about the tyrant, and possess At last the world their care and thought and skill Have fashioned and preserved. Then Greed's fierce fight, Rough schooling of a race half-savage yet, Shall cease, its purpose served, and Justice late Ascend her throne; labour and rest and joy Shall be the blesséd lot of all, and none Shall stint but rogues and idlers;—equals all, Not in the gifts of nature, but the claims Of brotherhood. Then not the chance of birth, Nor hoarded gold wrung from the weak and poor, But only the true kinghood of high souls, The hero's glory, and the godlike brow Of genius, shall have worship; then shall gladness Course through the people's veins, as when the hearts Of some vast throng are thrilling to one strain Of lofty music; pleasure shall not need To hide her eyes, ashamed that others' grief Pays for her pastime; luxury's sick craving, That owns no bound and therefore owns no peace, That feeding but provoketh, shall be turned To wholesome hunger, and lust's lawlessness To wise and sweet restraint; and Earth's best boon, The fellowship of hand and head and heart, The commune of true souls, shall lighten toil And heal life's deep divisions. But such boon Will never bless mankind till the dark gulf 'Twixt rich and poor, 'twixt sage and fool, 'twixt churl And gentle is bridged over—for true friends Are ever equals;—and that golden field, That gladsome harvest of man's fellowship, Now springing round our feet, will only reach Its fulness after sunlight of free thought And sunwarmth of wide sympathy have nursed Its growth for ages. Mankind's slow advance From this misgoverned waste, where one man's weal Worketh another's sorrow, to that realm Where all conspire for all, is steeper far, More toilsome, devious, and beset with snares, Than aught his feet have traversed. They that lag, Lamenting the old days, and they that haste To greet the future, first must suffer much, Much yield and much forbear, ere the long march Be ended, and the promised land descried. A weary way;—but whether with good cheer, Or downcast eyes, we needs must take the road; Backward we cannot; the world-powers that wait Our nod, inwrought from land to land, no blow, That spares this orb, can cancel;—the fierce giant That leaps to life when fire and water wed, Thunder's fleet daughter, and the subtle spirits That mingle in Earth's veins to save or slay, And mightier than all these, the living force That beckons and controls them, the arch-force Of human thought, of human love and will— These are the people's weapons; armed with these Toil's dense array shall hold its onward course, Shall compass the strong places where the lords Of wealth sit throned, and greed's inglorious sway Shall fail, as failed the sway of cowl and crest When learning woke, and art shook off her chains, And commerce spread her wings, and thought caught fire, And Europe had new birth. The people's lips Have touched the rim of wisdom's cup, and soon Shall drink it deeply, till the sacred wine Bound in their veins and fill them with the strength Of giants; and the watchword “All for All,” Uttered by millions marshalled in one cause, Shall win redress for labour's heaped-up wrongs, None daring to gainsay. But if the rich, Drowsy with comfort, stop their ears, that watchword Shall heighten to a battle-cry, and wake A conflict which shall grant no truce till toil From the fat purse of idle luxury Hath wrung the utmost farthing. Pity then For such as fain would put their needless wealth To faithful use—the wise, the kind, the just; Vainly they struggle, tangled in a web That is not of their weaving. Oft, when ease, High manners, and the pride of stately homes, The healthful glow of roaming o'er the world's Wide pleasure-ground, and all the finer joys That blossom in the summer atmosphere Of opulence, delight the rich man's soul— The drear abodes of penury, where swarm Gain's dull and haggard slave-hordes, suddenly Loom round him; and he feels as one that quits A feast, and, homeward journeying, while the wind Fans his flushed cheek, sees shivering 'neath the hedge An outcast woman gnawing a stale crust For very life, the babe upon her heart Plucking at empty breasts;—an alien she In garb and feature, thought, desire and deed, And yet a sister;—gladly would he yield Some costly superfluity, to still Her misery's reproach, but that his gift Would seem a sand-grain cast into a gulf That bounty cannot fill—“What use,” he cries, “To fling among the ravenous herd the store Of my fair jewels?—Christ bade it; but the poor, He spake of, were a handful;—had he known Our coarse and grimy millions, stale with toil And sour with sweat, that spice their drink with oaths, Wallow in filth, and breed like sewer-rats, He had not counselled thus. Moreover, Christ Lived upon alms;—the poor have ever preached This gospel of renouncement to the rich; And still the rich grow stronger, and the poor Weaker; so be it; the poor, in life's hot fray, Have yielded ground, they or their sires; while we Enjoy the conquests of our fathers' might, Conserve the nobler type, and, safe embowered In park and palace, nurture stately bearing, Calm thought and gracious speech, which else would die. 'Tis well; we do but yield assent to laws That Nature made, not we.”—So comforted, And heaving a short sigh of half content, Half pity, he fares homeward. But the poor Have pondered it, and will not any more Be cozened with this creed of Anti-Christ. Man is not wolf or beaver, that the son Should build as built the sire, each generation Wrangle and filch as we; Nature disdains A realm so narrow; and man's noblest powers— Wisdom and might to tame the brute within, Experience to live down his crimes and follies, Skill to contrive what fancy hath conceived, Harmonious effort toward a common good, Reflection, foresight, sympathy, with all That lifts him ever higher from the dust— Are Nature's gifts, and unto man as proper As cunning to the fox. Man's slow ascent From bestial ways to dignity of life, From war to peace, from wrong to righteousness, From slavery to freedom, is no less Nature's behest than that which bids the grub Forget the crawling life of old, and wake To find herself a winged and lustrous thing, Companion of the sunbeams and the flowers. Even so with man;—Nature hath not ordained For few the butterfly's bright play, for most The worm's ignoble wanderings, but wings At last for all. The sumptuous bowers, where Pride Wasteth the slender substance of the poor, Shall fall as fell Rome's drear magnificence, And comely homes shall flourish where to-day Are loathsome dens. The poor will learn to baulk The rich man of his laughter when a score Of desperate slaves contend to clutch the wage Of one; will rather choose to rear a pair Of sturdy saplings, spreading healthful arms To breeze and shower and sunshine, than a thicket Of stunted underwood. The man of toil, Slow as a dray-horse, gentle, patient, strong, Will cease at last to bear the monstrous load Of others' pride, and wage for others' waste The sordid strife we suffer, wherein he Prevails, who bawling his false wares can lie The loudest; will no more endure to see His sons grow wan with hunger, toil and care, His daughters seize the harlot's poisoned cup For mere oblivion of the fetid den Where Fashion's languid tyranny condemns Her needle-slaves to pine. The Greek of old, Nobly impatient of the slave's harsh lot, Sang of a good time coming, when the shuttle Should labour of itself, and man be free, His light toil o'er, to gladden his long ease With dance and feast and praise of the good gods. So sang the Greek;—and now the shuttle flies Unhandled, and the tameless elements Obey man's bidding, but by man misused Heap, for the few, possessions past the lust Of avarice, pollute the brow of heaven, And leave the burdened millions a grim choice 'Twixt slavehood and starvation. He is robed In softness, housed in splendour, and fed sleek, Body and soul, with dainties and delights, Who never wrought by sweat of brow or brain The value of a crust; while he who bears From dawn to dark the burden of the world, Raises its harvests, rears its lordly roofs, Clothes it with grace, and makes it for his master A dainty pleasure-house, must fight to win The rich man's leavings, dwell in sordid gloom, And seek forgetfulness in flattering fumes Of poisoned drams; his wife is gaunt with toil, And pale for lack of sleep; hunger and care, And pangs of travail, 'mid the ceaseless strain To feed and clothe her babes, have gnawed away Her beauty, and stern furrows scarred her brow; Her eye is cheerless in her withered cheek, Wanting the balm of tears—she hath no pause To weep in, only day by day she drags Her weary footsteps nearer to the grave. But that sweet gospel of the Greek of old Shall have fulfilment; not for evermore Shall they who dream and paint and pen fair things Alone be man's consolers, nor those only Physicians of the wounded soul who drown Its agony in music; but he too Who schemes some useful wonder shall behold His gift no more make tyrants of the drones, And of the work-bees slaves, but win for all Leisure and health and gladness—meed enough For highest toil, if further meed be asked Than the great joy of genius in its use, That prompts the lark to soar, the seer to search, The giant to stretch forward to the goal, The thinker to lose fortune, fame and ease For truth's sake, and the singer, toiling still The livelong day for bread, to yet uprise With dawn, and watch at midnight, for the love Of poesy. He slanders humankind Who doubts if men will toil, save to avoid The goad of hunger, or to win the prize Of riches wrung from others' misery;— Thinker and artist, healer, patriot, saint Cry shame on him. Ev'n now the craftsman joys To ply his craft, the strong man to put forth His strength, albeit another reaps the gain; Will he stand idle therefore, when the sheaves Belong no more to slothfulness, the gleanings To toil, but all the harvest is his own? Taketh a man no pride to lead the chase, Not lag behind, albeit the quarry slain Is not for him alone; or doth the soldier Shrink from the cannon's mouth because his comrades Will share with him the triumph?—The wide world Proclaimeth honour mightier far than greed, And help than strife; from sea to sea the nations, Choked with war's dust and wearied with its din, Shout it to one another; and those hordes That battle daily for a wretched wage, To pamper idlers, make it a muster-word For the great day of reckoning. Wrong sits crowned, But not for ever; knowledge daily paves The path for justice; and though yet afar, She cometh. Happy he, who, when these storms Have rolled away, shall dwell beneath a sky Bright with the sun of righteousness; then wealth Shall not breed want, nor toil be slave to waste, But all shall succour all; then this vexed knot Of tugging selfishness, this vast disorder, This cumbersome excess of costly show, This haggard strain, shall cease, and rich content Shall spread her pinions like a peaceful noon O'er the blest earth, and man be glad and free Alas! but oftentimes the heart turns sick With sorrow, and the eye of faith grows dim, Marking the blind contempt of those that have, The rage of those that have not; watching life's Broad flood roll by, its surface sparkling free— The fickle sport of sunbeam, cloud, and wind— Its depths drawn darkly onward, where disease, Lust and oppression, madness, hate and crime Mingle their turbid eddies; and doubt crieth, “So foul a stream will never lose its taint, Nor reach the expected ocean; but ere long The dykes will sunder, and some hideous deluge Ride over all; and when that waste of waters Hath washed Earth clean once more, a younger race Will suffer, flourish, sin and fall as we;— And so for ever—till the sick old planet Grow death-cold, and the sun with all his train Shock into Hercules.” Sad souls there be Who bode such evil.—Courage!—man, that knows His days are numbered, doth not therefore fling His cares and hopes aside, and let the thief Plunder his store unchallenged. Humankind Is sound at heart; the wise and good increase; And chiefly gain's stern fight hath lent to men Their cruel masks, which gladly they will doff When strife shall yield to concord. Never hand Hath wrought a marble god of common clay; And not the holiest laws inscribed in Heaven Can bind mean hearts to justice; yet if they, Whose nobler promptings age by age have lured Their brethren ever further from the brute, Had held their peace because the brute-life pleased The general herd, man had been wandering still A savage in the wilderness. He chargeth Men's bosoms with the lightning-flash who summons From narrow seeking after narrow ends To righteousness and justice; and the roar That bursts from the vast throng, ten thousand hearts Heaving as one, when some great patriot pleads, Is stronger than the earthquake; petty aims And paltry hates are drowned in that broad voice, And all, exalted o'er themselves, will blush Even to think the baseness each would act Single and uninspired.—The very bulk Of ocean, where the wind hath room to range, Purgeth it, while the standing pond grows foul. Therefore 'tis well that closer, day by day, The wide world o'er, the sons of toil forgather, And dreamers of a loftier life than ours Utter their burning visions, and just souls, Impatient of disunion's wasteful fray, Rally their scattered powers, and pledge their faith To lead true lives, to taste no pleasure wrung From others' grief, but share the common load According to their strength. What matters it That they, whose hands have planted here and there Oases in the desert of man's strife, Lived but to see the sand-blast strip their palms, The sand-drift choke their fountain?—'tis by stumbling We learn to walk aright; had no star-seer Mistold on Eastern plains the doom of kings, We had not known the moment when the moon Would mask her brow with shadow, or some wild And bright-haired truant through the fields of space Visit our skies once more. What matters scorn?— The record of man's triumphs is the tale Of dreams at first derided, next assailed, Lastly fulfilled. Where'er a young growth springs, Down-trodden by tradition's heavy hoof, There waits—the sap forced back to feed the root— A harvest for the future. Even now Such harvest waxeth. They who, sick to see Strife's blind self-slaughter, point to that fair realm Where Concord spreads her feast for all who will, Long mocked-at, then maligned, are now believed.— None saith, “The world stands still;” yet that which moves Must move somewhither; and what means this sound Of labour's mustering legions, or these hands That reach across a thousand leagues of sea To succour a fall'n comrade, if the end Be only the old reckless race to win Self's goal by others' stumbling, if the city Become once more the nomad's lonely tent?— Madmen would wiselier dream—but if man's path Lead not to self's inhospitable slough, A sunnier clime awaiteth him, where, toil Made light by union, thought and faith at one, Hate overcome by help, and art uncaged, Each soul shall breathe the same pure air and light, And differ but in graces. Blind are they To Nature's beckonings who fear lest men, Fattened no more on others' want, but bending Their shoulders to the general wheel of toil, Should lose the soul's distinction. Know we not That bushman features bushman, driven to seek The same base living by the same base means, As wolf resembleth wolf; that thought and art Then flourished first when mutual help had found A swifter and a safer road to ease Than single greed?—What space for growth of soul Hath he who strains the deathlong day, to wring From Mammon's clutch his wage of crust and rages— Less valued than a horse—for if he die, What then? another fights to fill his place; But horses have their price?—depraved and starved, Warped, numbed and stunted, how shall such as he Put forth those beauteous blossoms of the spirit, That purge indeed the air, yet will not bloom Where all is foul and sunless? Wise were he Passing man's scope, whose wit could apprehend Each glory of the landscape that lies hid Beyond our day's horizon—strange delights, Strange griefs, strange hopes;—but, clearly to discern Some wide and various harvest of the soul, That waits the tillage of a nobler race, And will not spring while of the husbandmen Some filch the seed, some trample on the blade, And most are stupid with the mill-horse round Of sordid cares, or maimed with misery— This craves no prophet. Surely from the heat That trembles in the world's deep soul to-day Will rise new growths and lovelier forms of life— Not suddenly, as when the metal cools, The mould is cracked, and lo! the statue stands; But slowly, like the growth of a great tree. The husbandman may train the boughs, may graft A nobler stock to feed upon its strength, But change its kind he cannot; husbandry Maketh the crab yield pippins, never grapes; And those old promptings of the heart of man, The love of home and kin, the joy to reap The fruit of his own labour, howsoe'er Their nature may be bent to worthier ends, Are rooted in the ages, and though lopped A hundred times will spread their arms anew. We seek not to molest them—toil is good And toil's reward—we seek to find for all A place in the world's workfield, where good will May win good recompense; we seek to stay The spoiler's hand, and bid the idler yield The sheaves he gathered not, that they may eat Who labour, and the generous heart no more Be bled by churls. Self-help is good; but they Who mark the trophies of man's care for man, His struggle from the savage to the saint, His yearning after justice, beauty, truth, The simple steadfast power of welded wills, The widening vision of the human soul Once swathed in darkness—well may such foretell A self-help stronger than the gripe of beast Or bandit, surer than the wasteful strife Of greed devouring greed. A mighty change, Enfolded in the troubled womb of time, Shapeth itself in silence; foolish hopes And fond alarms disquiet faithless breasts; Love waits the birth unfaltering.—The wise world Hath not forgot how in a simple room A Jewish craftsman with his fisher-friends Once ate their farewell supper; high priests hissed Their spite; Rome curled a lip of sickly scorn; But life was with the little brother-band, And mankind's slow salvation.—Love can wait. DIES NON The brooding halcyon hour is here at last; The world's tumultuous wrong has taken flight With that dark ocean-mood, which yesternight Did battle with the blast. Heaven smiles to see its beauty in the bay; Care lies a-drowning where the blue tide laves The rust-red weed, and frolic of light waves Laughs heaviness away. Fresh from the ripple's delicate caress, I lean upon the bosom of a rock, That basks with me, forgetful of the shock Of storms, the sea's distress; And listening, while the slow wave-crests unroll Their splendour, to the sea-mew's lonely cry, Sweet echoes of a sister melody Waken along my soul. Once more I seem to hear the wood-dove croon In secret covert consecrate to spring, The whisper of the forest's half-fledged wing Fanning the flush of noon; The long sea-murmur sweeping o'er a main Of billowy brake and glade, where sunshine dyes With touches of her tenderest harmonies The treetops' purple plain; And once more through the oak-grove's hoary screen, Beyond the faded fern, are caught afar Glimpses of larchwood where the wind-flowers star The thicket's early green. Again I seek the time-worn stones that pent A garden once, deep-sheltered from mankind, Now haunted only by the homeless wind And memory's low lament; And musing watch the kestrel o'er his bower Hover, with kingly pinions scarce astir, The butterfly, spring's motley harbinger, Sway on the sun-kissed flower; Or mark the slender shadows rise and fall Where in their silken cradles beech-leaves dream Of summer's bridal, and the soft sunbeam Sleeps on the windless wall, And warms to life the old romance that strays Forgotten where the rose-leaves mouldering lie, And weds it with the gracious luxury That decks these fuller days— The nestling grange that seems a friendlier part Of Nature's self, in outward guise akin To some moss-suited crag, and clothed within By Nature's consort, Art; There Welcome waits beside the ruddy glow That flecks the roof and laughs along the floor, There Farewell passeth through the crowded door With lingering steps and slow; There, ranged in carven shrines, rich caskets keep The embalméd wisdom of the deathless dead, And music summons pity, love and dread From out the spirit's deep; Or while the wine-cup sparkles, thought's free tide Flows eddying onward, limpid, smooth, profound, Or leaping from the heights with sudden bound Laugheth where shallows glide. Care vexeth not, nor calumny molests The quiet of that home; but settled soft O'er roof and lawn, o'er bower and stream and croft, A mellow gladness rests. The squirrel on the daisy-freckled grass Sports unafraid; the poet's daffodil Stoopeth to kiss his semblance in the rill; And when spring's love-dreams pass, Roses shall queen it, making every breath A pant of joy; the peach shall sun her cheek When bird-songs tire and hues of evening streak The creeper's beauteous death. Nor is the scene less fair when dead leaves lie Thick in the pool's clear bosom, and the pines Darken, and o'er the sodden meadow shines A blue November sky; Or when the bare boughs' livelier tints are lost In black against the snow, and from the eaves Hang ice-spears, and the holly's trim-cut leaves Are edged and spiked with frost. Ah! genial home! where every season lends Fresh grace, where hospitality's glad rites Bless, and the loving-cup of deep delights Circles among close friends. There youth might twine the laurel and the rose, Manhood forget the world, and old age lull The soul to slumber, calm and beautiful As autumn's rich repose; But that afar, where smothered with a pall Of vapour the great cities sweat and groan, From misery's dull heart a weary moan Ascendeth, marring all. WELCOME TO THE QUEEN On the occasion of Her Majesty's visit to Birmingham, in the year of Her Jubilee, to lay the foundation-stone of the Victoria Law Courts. Hail! Mother of thy people! Hail! Who deignest, in this golden year, To lift awhile the widow's veil, And with a sovereign smile to cheer The gloom, that widening hour by hour Enfolds the heart of England's toil, The clouds that, ever gathering, lower Above the clang of our turmoil. Now wellnigh thirty years have lent A graver glory to thy brow, Since last our barrier'd thousands rent The air with one vast welcome; now The beard is grey of him who ran, Clasping his child, to gain a place; And the child's self, a stalwart man, Shoulders his way to see thy face. What though we miss the genial voice Of that pure soul, whose princely tone, A nation's pride, love's simple choice, Made faultless music with thine own; His gracious influence rules us yet, His memory still inspires our way, And joy makes welcome of regret— His spirit lives with thine to-day. Then brook, great Queen, thy people's glee; We cannot choose but let thee know Our gladness in thy jubilee, The joy that makes our hearts o'erflow; So once again this steadfast town Doffs for a day its sober dress, Unknits the firmness of its frown, And revels wide in happiness. So once again our paths are dense With myriads of thy strong ones; high Throbs every pulse in rare suspense, And eager looks of loyalty Crowd every casement; the gay streets, With flag-festoons and streamers hung, Laugh out, and every steeple greets Its Sovereign with a rapturous tongue. And now a happy murmur fills The air, till brass and drums give out The nation's hymn;—each bosom thrills A moment;—then one mighty shout Bursts from a thousand breasts, and drowns The ponderous chords, and ever moves Beside thee as thou mov'st, and crowns Thee Victress of thy people's loves. Despise not our rough welcome; we Know little here of cultured calm; But in our reverence for thee To none will we forego the palm; Ours is a hopeful discontent That slumbers not while harm is wrought, A spirit stout and confident, And rugged ore of honest thought. Here labour makes the daylight dark, And while night's roof of lurid smoke Reflects the leaping furnace—hark! The giant hammer's thunder-stroke!— Yet have we hearts as soft as strong, Hands ever swift to succour need, Blood that can boil at tale of wrong, And heritage of manly deed. Here dwelt the seer whose thoughtful eye First clove in twain Air's subtle stream; Here mind's divine supremacy Tamed to our use the monster Steam; And here Toil's nameless warriors give Their lives to yield the world increase, And patient armaments achieve The bounteous victories of peace. Then welcome, welcome! for thy reign Is rich with trophies, that shall last When to a wiser world in vain Destruction sounds her frantic blast; On lightning's wing our counsels flit, The ocean shrinks, the hills depart, The power most swift to slay hath knit The nations into one great heart. Now Knowledge sheds her quickening ray In darkest haunts, and selfless Skill Hath woven many a spell to stay The progress of the powers of ill; Truth lifts her head, Oppression quails, A purer air surrounds the throne; And slowly o'er the land prevails The spirit of the Lord we own. What though the shades of doubt affright, And God's new dayspring tarries long; What though from dens of woe each night Ascends the cry of nameless wrong; What though Want's ravening billow rolls Around the heedless isles of lust; Never, to cope withal, were souls More earnest, tender, brave and just. Then welcome! for thou com'st to found A Hall of Right. May Justice flow Free through the realm, nor stagnate, bound In one choked well; that men may know 'Tis not for naught the sunlight dyes Our Hall with hues that speak thy fame, While round us, far and wide, arise Memorials of thy glorious name! Glorious in queenhood, for above The reach of malice shines thy power; Glorious in womanhood, for love And noble sorrow are thy dower.— Would that all English breasts, which swell Like ours with joy of jubilee, Might mingle one full cheer, to tell The faith and love they bear to thee! May no presaging dread molest The peace that broods around the shore Of thy loved isle, though all the West Be dark with clouds of threatening war; But may thy world-wide Empire, drawn To one close brotherhood, sustain The promise of a holier dawn, The triumph of thy matchless reign! SPRING SONG The fragrance of awakening flowers Quickens the breath of Spring; Exulting in their bridal bowers The mated wood-birds sing; The lark is up; the gentle air Carols light music everywhere. The bee sings at her lovely toil, The cricket at his play; The redbreast scans the fresh-turned soil; The meadows, pied with May, Shimmer beneath the trembling blue.— Since all is song, I warble too. A CHRISTMAS CAROL Cheerless, through dens of want and death, Where unregarded woe blasphemes The Lord in whom we boast our faith, The Christmas dayspring gleams. Friend of the poor! that spak'st of one Beside whose gate a lazar lay, Dost mark the deeds of love undone Where Love is preached to-day? The man that leaves thy poor in hell, And saith to his fed heart, “Am I My brother's keeper, so I dwell In halls that hear no cry?” The noisome tree, whereof the fruit Is pomp and lust, which fills the air With pestilence, and hath its root In hunger and despair? O Thou, whose smile the children knew! Dost mark on yonder garret-bed, Where weeps the rain the rafters through, Three starvelings, and one dead? And him who lolls in Pleasure's lap, With dice and wine and paramour, And tosses in a jockey's cap The wages of the poor? Avenging God! who woke at length, A hundred years gone by, and gave For one tremendous hour the strength Of Samson to the slave; And made repent in tears and blood The harsh oppressors of the world— How long, ere yet of Brotherhood The banner be unfurled? MORNING TWILIGHT Sadly in the silent west, The moon, worn-out with watching all the night Over the sleeping earth, her cheek Hollow and white, Wan with a sorrow that she may not speak, Sinks to her lonely rest. Like a love-deserted maid, That dare not meet her lord awake, but steals By night to his bedside, to mourn Her loss, and feels Him waking, in the sunlight of his scorn Triumphantly arrayed. THE SEMPSTRESS TO HER SKYLARK Poor little captive!—never more To seek the sunlight-hidden stars!— I know what 'tis to break the heart, Searching the sky through prison-bars. “O for a breath of ocean-air! O for a draught of morning dew Fresh from the cowslip-cup, and bright With heaven's all-embracing blue! “O for the speedwell's azure smile! Of for the mountain's noonday sigh! O for the clouds!”—and yet, dear lark, Thou canst not love them more than I. —Now cease to chafe that ruffled breast; For by my sorrow, pretty sweet, This very evening thou shalt rest Beneath the moonbeams and the wheat.— Farewell—farewell!—O for a friend To do what I have done for thee!— But patience!—though men's hearts are hard, God's hand some day will set me free. SEMPER EADEM Three hundred years have passed since Spain O'ershadowed thought's new dawn with fear, And proudly forged a Titan's chain, And rattled it in Freedom's ear; And dared upon the deep to flaunt The pomp of hate, the pride of creed, And vexed our waves with idle vaunt— Lo now!—her sceptre is a reed. They lie where storm and sea go forth To wage o'erhead eternal fight, Where the foundations of the North Unshaken rest in voiceless night; The rust hath eaten bolt and brand, With weed the wrecks are mantled o'er, Those iron throats are choked with sand That roared against our native shore. Yet not in Britain's golden days Were men united, save in deed; For some deplored, with wistful gaze, The sunset of a parting creed, And some desired the dawn; but all Uprose as one to face the foe, And girt them at their country's call, And laid the bold invader low. Three hundred years have passed, and Spain Wears yet the shackles of the priest, And knout and famine goad in vain The sullen slave-hordes of the East; The nations yet grow great in guilt, Aspiring but to overwhelm, While restlessly, with hand on hilt, Suspicion scowls from realm to realm. But who shall say old England grows Less hale, her sons of meaner mood? Their life hath dyed the Russian snows, The desert sand hath drunk their blood; Though valiant deeds no more are done With wings of white and oaken keel, Each stands as steadfast to his gun, And iron ribs hold hearts of steel. We fear no stranger. Our worst foe Teems in our midst, where in grim street, Choked with Advancement's overflow, The eyes of Vice and Hunger meet; Where myriads draw their joyless breath Only to sweat, and drink, and breed, And haggard mothers drug to death The babes their bosom fails to feed. Yet while hearts hotly swell, when Wrong Fastens upon his helpless prey, And while eyes beam with light, that long To tear the mask of Fraud away; While keen and watchful brains abide To cast the Future's horoscope, And generous heirs of ease and pride Renounce their birthright—there is hope. THE DEAD CAPTAIN Fallen!—we shall not see his sword again Flash in the bitter conflict waged with wrong; Nor hear his voice, amid the uncertain throng, Call to his rallying comrades, not in vain. The weakling lies not always with the slain, The triumph is not always to the strong. We question not the dark decree; we trust 'Twas well for him; for us 'tis well; the lust For power and fame, the weakness to be great, Are quelled with grief, and humbled to the dust, Where by the simple bed Death holds his state. WITH FLOWERS If these smile bright, believe they know That beauty is a flower; If crushed and drooping, they confess Thy smile's victorious power; If they look pale, it is because They pined and paled for thee; And if they blush, believe their hearts Are trembling consciously. They wither, doomed through death alone To greet a flower more fair; Yet, ere they perish, kiss them once, 'Twill raise thine image there; For often as thy fragrant breath Is mingling with their scents, There meet an angel and a flower, Thine own pure elements. A STORM SCENE Crash out, ye mighty chords!—The heavens are black With wrath; the lightnings shudder through the air, And blind with fury tear The huddling rack, Furling its pale and tattered banners o'er Yon steel expanse; Tender as newborn love a rainbow glows, The warm mist 'neath it flushes moist and rose, City and sea and shore Steeped in one trance. And every treetop sparkles with its leaves Refulgent in the setting sun; The meads are golden-green, rich with the storm Of Nature's summer-love; Far in the night above A white bird twinkles like a star, and cleaves The thunder-caverns dun; Denser and louder forth the sullen tempests swarm. Crash out, vast symphony!—thy lover hears And worships.—It is over—those fierce tears Have blotted all to grey; With smothered moan Great Nature's passion-music, like our own, Is sobbed away. TO ONE IN SORROW Patience! Time's gently-pressing palm Is on thy wound. Thou canst not feel The virtue of the looks that calm, The quiet of the hands that heal; Yet some glad morning thou shalt rise To taste again Joy's sweet surprise. So from the day that saw it fade The plant takes heart. Thou canst not mark The hueless bud, the wrinkled blade, Forcing their prison cold and dark; Yet in some fostering, sunny hour Doth spring to life a newborn flower. TO SWEET SEVENTEEN To thee, young queen, these tribute lines Charged with my love—the word is writ; A daintier word were false; but “love” No more can tell the soul of it, Than “light” can tell the myriad mood Of sunshine; from the fickle play Which frolics through the dappled leaves When all the lanes are white with May, To that full bliss of warmth which lies Delirious on the breast of June, Or sunset flash of burdened heavens, Or dreamy glow of autumn noon. So “love”—poor word—is all we have, To paint each radiant power that makes The sunshine of a human heart; From the sweet sense of want which wakes In childhood's breast, to ripe repose Of wedded faith, or ecstasy Of passionate youth, or such delight As that I take, fair girl, in thee. GRASS OF PARNASSUS There is a flower, a milk-white star, That twinkles on the mountain-side, Up-glancing where its sisters are, Sightless beyond the blue noontide. One simple leaf, an emerald heart, Closes around its slender stem;— Not all the witchery of art Could fashion such a faultless gem. Look on its snowy brow!—O see The tracery that veins its cheek!— The faintly-flushed anemone Is not more delicate and meek. Yet where the unbridled tempest blows— A sunbeam cradled in the storm— It smiles in innocent repose, A peaceful, pure and perfect form. AUTUMN SONG The year grows heavy; but the hour Is fresh as April; the blithe air Is tremulous with sun and shower; A rainbow smiles farewell To the spent storm, and everywhere Song breaks from hill and dell. So when the summer of our life Fades into autumn, now and then An hour will come to us, sweet wife, When all our soul shall sing, And all our heart shall leap, as when We drank the dew of Spring. SERENADE When moonlight o'er thy casement weaves Its network through the breathless leaves, And lake and lawn beneath the summer sky Dream in the mist— Ah! sweet! a lovelier scene within doth lie By slumber kist. And when the stars begin to pale, And trampling on her crimson veil Young Morning flashes forth with dewy hair And sparkling eyes— Ah! sweet! I linger for a dawn more fair, When thou shalt rise.</field>
