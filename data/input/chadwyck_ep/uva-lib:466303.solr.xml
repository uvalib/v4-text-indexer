      <field name="fulltext">Our Sungleams do no pass away, Their memory cheers an afterday.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY DEAR BROTHER, HORACE NEWTON, THIS VOLUME IS INSCRIBED, IN GRATEFUL REMEMBRANCE OF MANY HAPPY VISITS TO A HIGHLAND HOME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RONDEAUX. To the Reader. Sungleams I bring to cheer the way Of those who 'neath Life's shadows stray: As when through over-arching green, Whose leafy depths the song-birds screen, Glimmers full many a flickering ray. In measures of an olden day I weave my unambitious lay, But through these artful forms, I ween, Sungleams I bring. For round these songs of earth, I pray, Oh that Heaven's smile may kindly play: Then gliding down there will be seen A ray of God's own light serene, And he who reads perforce will say, Sungleams I bring. Londesborough Rectory, Midsummer Day, 1881. I. “LUX MEA CHRISTUS;” CHRIST BE MY LIGHT. Christ be my Light, to show the way, As through Life's doubtful paths I stray, A pillar of soft fire by night, To guide my darkling footsteps right, And an illumined cloud by day. When earth's sweet sunshine fades away, And mists of evening gather grey, And one dark Shadow looms in sight, Christ be my Light. When Heaven's gate shows its pearly ray, And golden splendours round me play, And I behold God's armies bright Circling the throne in lustrous white, Still let my longing spirit say, Christ be my Light! II. MY WINDOW BIRDS. My window birds, I love to strew With punctual hand the crumbs for you, Flying for comfort day by day From frozen woodland and highway, And bringing Christmas bills now due! Fair creditors of every hue, Crimson and yellow, brown and blue, Whate'er your thoughts, your coats are gay, My window birds. Your claims are neither small nor few, Dated, when May-flowers drank the dew, And on sweet pipes ye used to play, Scattering full many a golden lay; Now ye for wages mutely sue, My window birds. III. SWAN AND CYGNETS. Under her wing, soft, fair, and wide, Her tender cygnets safely hide, Or follow her, as to and fro She gently steers her plumes of snow, Which o'er the dimpling water slide. Secure they nestle at her side, Secure along the lake they glide, Sure of a home where'er they go, Under her wing. Ah, of a wing more white I know, Unfailing refuge here below, Where I may feel, whate'er betide, If in its shadow I abide, How Grace can peace and rest bestow Under her wing. IV. SNOWDROPS AND ACONITES. Silver and gold! The snowdrop white And yellow-blossomed aconite, Waking from Winter's slumber cold, Their hoarded treasures now unfold, And scatter them to left and right. Ah, with how much more rare delight Upon my sense their colours smite Than if my fingers were to hold Silver and gold. They bear the superscription bright Of the great King of love and might, Who stamped such beauty there of old That men might learn, as ages rolled, To trust in God, nor worship quite Silver and gold. V. THE SNOWDROP DIES. The snowdrop dies, yet the woods ring With happy voices of the Spring, As if they would rebuke the sighs Which in the pensive heart arise, To see such grace so soon take wing. This is a time to dance and sing, And not round mournful fancies cling, Or murmur forth, with downcast eyes, The snowdrop dies! Full many a flower can Nature bring, And richer hues about her fling: Look up and see the sunlit skies; Beauty remains, though beauty flies: By fiat of fair Nature's King The snowdrop dies. VI. THE THRUSH. With bursts of praise the thrushes cheer The faint gleams of the newborn year: No thought of lurking Winter stays The careless gladness of their lays: A present brightness quenches fear. They heed not clouds that gather near; They wait not till May-flowers appear; But hail the warmth of transient rays With bursts of praise. O wise and happy soul that pays Thanks for each gleam that lights our days; Nor claims a bliss complete and clear Before it warbles in God's ear, But glorifies Life's common ways With bursts of praise. VIII. THE CELANDINE. Bright celandine, a Poet's eye See Wordsworth's three poems on this flower. Has glorified your destiny, Making your yellow petals shine With a new lustre half-divine, Caught from his smile and notice high. The earliest bees that murmur by Pause as your chalice they espy, And linger o'er the nectar fine, Bright celandine. To me you are a blessed sign, That cheers my spirit more than wine, Of golden sunshine, and clear sky, And hosts of flowers that muster nigh— Captain of all the jocund line, Bright celandine. IX. ANEMONES, OR WIND-FLOWERS. Anemones in pink and white, With gladsome looks ye meet our sight, And when keen April breezes blow, Ye toss your tresses to and fro, And dance as in the wind's despite. Here in our woodland walks ye smite The wondering eye with new delight, For in a golden garb we show Anemones. The yellow Anemone is found in Londesborough Pleasure Grounds. Twinkle, ye sylvan stars of light, With cheery rays on Sorrow's night, And teach us, as with footsteps slow Through this sad windy world we go, To emulate the brave and bright Anemones. XI. SWEET VIOLETS. Sweet violets, once more I view Your lovely petals white and blue! Your odorous breath once more I feel Like far-off music o'er me steal, While tearful joys my soul imbue. Ye glisten as with childhood's dew; I see the banks where then ye grew; Founts of remembrance ye unseal, Sweet violets. For children still your fragrance strew— For ever fair, for ever new: But while fresh beauties ye reveal, Still to the fading Past appeal: Be kind to Hope, to Memory true, Sweet violets. XII. SAD AND ALONE. Sad and alone and seeking rest From cares that agitate the breast, I saw beneath a shady bower A tall and tapering lily-flower, Nodding at ease its turbaned crest. Hard by, a bird in mossy nest Her speckled eggs securely prest, And felt not, brooding hour by hour, Sad and alone. O vision sweet of peace and power, And bright with more than Nature's dower! O bird and lily, ye have blest With healing balm a heart distrest; Nor will I feel, when shadows lower, Sad and alone. XV. O'ER UNKNOWN GRAVES. O'er unknown graves the snowdrops bloom, And with a line of light illume These mouldering mounds of faded green, Where long ago Love's hand was seen Decking with flowers the recent tomb. Lost are their very names for whom Love wrought—in dark oblivion's doom, But still the snowdrops shine serene O'er unknown graves. If when we quit this mortal scene We are as though we had not been, For other faces making room— Hope, like a snowdrop, lights the gloom; Nature and God keep watch, I ween, O'er unknown graves. XVI. ON A WREATH OF FLOWERS FROM JERUSALEM. The Holy Land this wreath has lent, Of gold and scarlet gaily blent With humbler tints of green and blue— The self-same flowers that met Love's view, While here His pilgrim years He spent. O'er such fair favourites I have bent When through our English lanes I went, And loved the very blooms that strew The Holy Land. O flowers of East or West, to you Our faithless hearts the Saviour drew For everlasting solacement; Marking your every hue and scent As with mild eyes He wandered through The Holy Land. XVII. ON A PICTURE OF A PASSION-FLOWER UPON A CROSS. A passion-flower upon the Tree, Where Love once drooped to set me free, Unfolds, as with a gracious dower Of peace and loveliness and power, And bright expanding liberty. This blossom fair a type shall be Of Innocence that bled for me, To make my heart from hour to hour A passion-flower. O blessèd Cross, I cling to thee For time and for eternity: The barren Tree becomes a bower, A pleasure-house, a refuge-tower, While in each drop of blood I see A passion-flower. XVIII. SWEET EYES OF BLUE. To my Grandson, on the first anniversary of his birthday, May 19, 1880. Sweet eyes of blue, I miss your light, Flashed for a while upon my sight, As lucid as the morning dew, Or May-flower bursting into view With its first petals fair and bright. Your orbs are fountains of delight, Twin mirrors of the azure height; Heaven seems to kiss the earth in you, Sweet eyes of blue. Shine on in meekness and in might, Like stars that tremble through the night; And, as life's journey we pursue, Like speedwells bring us comfort true, And still to Heavenly hope invite, Sweet eyes of blue. XXI. THE SEPULCHRE. The Sepulchre, the sacred Tomb— Link not its name with thoughts of gloom; For near it smiled a garden-ground, And many a branching tree was found Where birds to roost and sing had room. Here lilies hung their fair white bloom, And roses shed a rich perfume, And vines with twining tendrils crowned The Sepulchre. Approach, my soul, without a sound, But let all peaceful thoughts abound: This place is potent to illume The dimness of thy mortal doom, And spread a wreath of hope around The Sepulchre. XXII. ASCENSION-DAY. Ascension-Day, the crown of Spring, Thy praises let the woodlands ring, Let music flow from every spray— A mingled but harmonious lay— Or soar aloft on the lark's wing. Let opening blossoms incense fling, And silky leaves their banners bring, While mounting sap attests thy sway, Ascension-day. My soul, my glory, rise and sing, Bursting the chains which bind and cling: Still let me climb the Heavenward way; Till, while I praise and work and pray, 'Tis always, through my Lord and King, Ascension-day! XXIII “SPRING UP, O WELL!” Numb. xxi. 17. (For Whitsunday.) “Spring up, O Well,” the way is drear, No pleasant streams are murmuring here; But barren sands stretch all around, Where not a shadow cools the ground, And not a song-bird soothes the ear. O Living Water, let me hear Thy cadence, musical and clear: Flowers bloom, birds sing, where Thou art found,— “Spring up, O Well!” In Thy still depths will oft appear An Image fair, which I hold dear— Whose Presence makes all joys abound, Whose Voice commingles with Thy sound; And since He smiles, when Thou art near, “Spring up, O Well!” XXIV. SWEET MELMERBY. Sweet Melmerby, thou lurkest well Beneath the shadow of Cross Fell, Where centuries since was lifted high The Sign whose glory ne'er will die, While mortals list to sorrow's knell. Thy name is potent to dispel The weariness of Care, and tell Of all that cheers the heart and eye, Sweet Melmerby! Peace and repose within thee dwell, Or wander down thy sylvan dell, Lulled by the brook that singeth nigh; Or wood-dove's sylvan melody, Meet symbol of thy mystic spell, Sweet Melmerby! XXV. GLENCRIPISDALE. Glencripisdale, thy name bestows A sylvan joy, a wild repose— With hanging wood and winding glen, Sequestered from the feet of men, But which the antlered wanderer knows. What balmy air about thee blows, Round thy blue loch what beauty glows, No pencil can declare, or pen, Glencripisdale. O'er sounding falls thy river flows, Whose muffled thunder comes and goes: Far skiey peaks allure the ken, Now shining fair, now veiled again; While guardian mountains round thee close, Glencripisdale. XXVII. GOD WILL PROVIDE. “God will provide.”—Amid the beat And noise of wheels and tramping feet, I caught the unexpected sound, Which, with the light of holy ground, Illumed the dim and squalid street. And whose the voice my ear to greet With that Divine assurance sweet— Old music which Moriah crowned,— “God will provide”? I turned. Two women coarsely gowned, Shawls loosely wrapped their heads around, An infant bore with footsteps fleet: Care in their hearts had fixed its seat, But they Heaven's antidote had found— “God will provide.” XXVIII. TREASURE IN HEAVEN. Treasure in Heaven, how rich and rare! Scarce aught is left on earth so fair; An angel-history just begun, The jewel of an only son, Taken and laid up safely there! Oh, he was precious, yet I dare Entrust him to Love's unseen care; I miss him here, but I have won Treasure in Heaven. Such whiteness as the snowdrops wear, Or lilies sweetening all the air, Circles his name beneath the sun: And till my earthly course is run, There shines for me, howe'er I fare, Treasure in Heaven. XXIX. SNOWDROPS IN SNOW. Snowdrops in snow to-day are seen, Mingling a twofold ray serene— Whiteness of earth with greenish hue, Whiteness of heaven just touched with blue; 'Tis hard to choose such rays between. Nought could endure that heavenly sheen But this immaculate bloom, I ween; Nay, this is fairer of the two— Snowdrops in snow. From a dry ground at Nazareth grew Such a meek spotless Flower, and drew Sweet human tinge from earthly scene— The One pure Life that here has been; I think of it whene'er I view Snowdrops in snow. XXX. HEAVEN ON THE EARTH. “As the days of heaven on the earth.” —Deut. xi. 21. Heaven on the earth! It meets our eyes In this terrestrial Paradise, Where Sunart's waves of azure sheen Greeting the glen of glens are seen, And smiling to the Summer skies;— Where the protecting mountains rise, Enamelled with purpureal dyes, And flashing from their brows serene Heaven on the Earth. Where thoughts of One will intervene Who shared with us this lovely scene; But gazes now in rapt surprise On beauty such as far outvies All that to him or us hath been Heaven on the Earth. XXXI. “THE LORD IS THERE.” Ezek. xlviii. 35. “The Lord is there!”—O title high Which o'er yon portal I espy— Fair entrance of a City fair, Fann'd with the breath of balmy air Fresh from the Tree of life hard by. All precious stones that charm the eye, Pearl-gates with streets of gold that vie, Must pale before that wonder rare— “The Lord is there.” O City of the saints, though I For your sweet rest and glory sigh, Yet now your chiefest joy I share, If in my heart Christ's peace I bear, And hear One whisper graciously, “The Lord is there.” XXXII. MOTHER AND CHILD. Mother and child—I see them now: The light on that young mother's brow, As at the Font she takes her stand; Nor comes to God with empty hand, But brings her babe and seals her vow. Wild berries of the rowan-bough With beauty rare the Font endow, As if a breath of Nature fann'd Mother and child. But whence this holier Breath, and how? From no fair groves of earth, I trow. 'Tis wafted from a brighter land, From Heavenly bowers serene and grand— Best boon our Father can allow Mother and child. XXXIII. THE WOODBINE IN THE WOOD. Unseen, unknown, this lovely flower Sweetened and beautified its bower, With none to witness it was fair, Or know how it enriched the air, Responsive to the sun and shower. A gloom of pines might round it lower, Jealous to keep its fragrant dower; Contentedly it blossomed there, Unseen, unknown. May I its humble wisdom share, And serve the Master anywhere, Submissive to His love and power; And wait with patience for His hour To place the crown on work and prayer Unseen, unknown. XXXIV. MY LITTLE GIRLS. “My little girls”—alas! no more I speak those words so sweet of yore, When at my feet ye used to play, Or in my arms securely lay, Dear innocents of two and four. Love's messages to me ye bore In broken lights of Heavenly lore, Which touched with soft reflected ray My little girls. Ye seemed to linger by the door Which opens from the Eternal shore, Where “babes and sucklings” day by day Divinely prattle, praise, and pray; And whence a glory hovered o'er My little girls. XXXV. A DAUGHTER'S LOVE. A daughter's love—what symbol rare Can with its preciousness compare? 'Tis like the clinging eglantine, Whose odorous summer-wreaths entwine An ancient oak-tree gnarled and bare. Or when, with waving blossoms fair, The wild-rose scents the morning air, I welcome, in the fragrance fine, A daughter's love. 'Tis like the clusters of the vine, Which warm the heart with purple wine, Soothing the furrowed brow of Care: 'Tis like all sweet things everywhere, Which can but hint—when they combine— A daughter's love. XXXVI. TO FRIENDS ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF THEIR WEDDING-DAY. Your wedding-day,—God make it bright With earthly and with heavenly light: So friends, both near and far away, On this auspicious morning pray: God deck its shining hours in white! As Memory brings the Past to sight, Thank Him who led your steps aright, And with a wreath of praise array Your wedding-day. And if you miss one sunny ray Which for a moment cheered your way, Think of the blossom of delight That waits you on that happy height, And blesses now, as well he may, Your wedding-day. XXXVII. TO FRIENDS SOJOURNING AMONG THE VAUDOIS. O friends of mine, beloved of old, Whom time and circumstance withhold From dear communion face to face— Have kindly thoughts of me found place 'Mid Vaudois mountains towering bold? Where peaks their snowy brows unfold, And rivers in cascades are rolled, Seem you a far-off voice to trace, O friends of mine? I leap across the bars of space; The valley-paths with you I pace; Where Faith through fiery woes untold Once passed, but came forth pure as gold: God grant to us such conquering grace, O friends of mine! XXXVIII. WHEN NATURE DROOPS; OR, The Robin and the Golden-Crested Wren. When Nature droops and flowers are dead And all the birds are dumb or fled, There flits about a crimson breast, There flashes forth a fiery crest, And through dim groves a light is spread. And why is seen that mystic red? Why sits the fire upon that head? Why golden crown and ruddy vest, When Nature droops? The soul that oft with tears was fed, And through rough ways of darkness led, Beneath the Crimson Tree finds rest, With fire from Heaven is warmed and blest, And feels that Grace a glow can shed When Nature droops. XXXIX. WHEN NATURE WAKES; OR, Snowdrops. When Nature wakes, in Winter's spite, Beneath her winding-sheet of white, She starts up from her chilling bier In haste to welcome the New Year With Earth's first flowers, a token bright. Truly a garland of delight Are snowdrops, bursting from the night Of Winter's gloom, sad hearts to cheer, When Nature wakes. In groups they shine, and charm the sight, Where sheltered garden-nooks invite; And from their silver bells you hear Faint echoes of the summons clear Which stirs all earth, in depth and height, When Nature wakes. XL. SWEETNESS AND STRENGTH. Sweetness and strength in Thee I find, Thou Lord and Lover of mankind— Sweetness the weary soul to ease, Like voice of birds or murmuring bees, Or sylvan music undefined: Might to uphold the trembling mind, A Rock that breasts the wave and wind; A Rose that scents the Evening breeze— Sweetness and strength. Lord, as I sail Life's wintry seas, Or sit beneath its Summer trees, Give me a will serene, resigned, With force and fortitude combined: I beg of Thee, on bended knees, Sweetness and strength. XLI. “BE OF GOOD CHEER.” Matt. xiv. 27. “Be of good cheer”—though waves run high, And midnight darkness veils the sky; Although the wind roars in their ear, And every heart is bowed with fear, While death itself seems hovering nigh. What sudden glory fills their eye? What gracious Form do they descry? What soothing voice is that they hear— “Be of good cheer”? O sweet and glorious “It is I!” Still able, when we sink or sigh, Our sorrow-clouded sky to clear, And make our doubts to disappear, Bidding us, when for help we cry, “Be of good cheer.” XLII. ON THE RECENT DISCOVERY OF AN ANGLO-SAXON BURYING-PLACE IN LONDESBOROUGH PARK. A thousand years like waves have rolled Across this bare and windy wold, Since here were laid, in kindred clay, Sad wanderers of a cheerless day, Sheep that no Shepherd knew, or fold. These amber beads, these daggers old, And brooches, which no garments hold, Have ne'er reflected one warm ray A thousand years. Lord, give me faith and love, I pray, A quiet spirit's meek array, Which still shall shine, like wreathèd gold, Or precious stones of worth untold, When o'er my dust have rolled away A thousand years! XLIII. WOODS O' DUNMORE. Woods o' Dunmore, when Summer smiles, 'Tis joy to pace your solemn aisles, Or sit beneath the fluttering roof Where Nature, with her warp and woof Of shine and shade, the eye beguiles. Tall fir-trees stretch their stately files, The beech its tiers of foliage piles, Ferns scatter gold in your behoof, Woods o' Dunmore. Let nothing enter that defiles— The wild dove only weaves its wiles, Of peace the vocal pledge and proof: Nor holds the Heavenly Dove aloof, But sings sweet songs in you at whiles, Woods o' Dunmore. XLIV. ON MY HIGHLAND HARE. Without a care, and fondly prest Upon my circling arm or breast, Peace beaming from its half-shut eye— No trouble known, no danger nigh— My gentle favourite sinks to rest. Ah, on its native mountain crest, Could it have found a nook or nest, Where it might hear the storm rush by, Without a care? Against our will we may be blest: Let me not shrink or be distrest If cloud of change o'erspread my sky; It is God's shadowing Hand, and I Will let Love choose what Love deems best, Without a care. XLV. EAST WIND IN JUNE. East Wind in June, and clouded sky, And ruffled leaves that mourn and sigh, And flutter down, alas! too soon; What discord for a Summer noon, Troubling the sylvan harmony. When love demands a smile, may I Refuse not timely sympathy, Or bring, for friendship's genial boon, East Wind in June. In yonder peaceful fields on high, Yon bowers of Paradise, which lie Beyond the “glimpses of the moon,” No breath shall reach us out of tune, But lapt in bliss we shall defy East Wind in June. XLVI. MY SPECTACLES. “My Spectacles!” I said, and sighed, To find how wholly I relied On crystal aids to clear the page— New token of on-creeping age, To be well noted, not denied. Let not the young folk in their pride These crutches of the eyes deride, Or drive with laughter from the stage— My spectacles. Not always will sweet youth abide; Then let its hours, as swift they glide, Make much of “old experience” sage— Till, quitting this dim mortal cage For keener sight, I lay aside My spectacles. XLVII. A CUP OF TEA, Under the great waterfall, Glencripisdale, after a climb up Ben Yattan. A cup of tea beside the Fall Whose waters rush and whirl and brawl, And madly flash, and wildly shine, And make a dissonance divine,— A cup of tea is worth them all! For Nature's glories needs must pall, And on a jaded fancy call, Unless I duly claim as mine A cup of tea. Then thanks be to those fingers fine That set about the fair design To drown the weary water's drawl With steaming streams that never “stall;” Better than water or than wine A cup of tea! XLVIII. THE SOOTHING LYRE. The soothing lyre a maiden sought, To ease her heart with sorrow fraught; And found in music soft and low A gentle balm to heal the blow, And mildly set its power at nought. Amid the strings her ear has caught A strain from holier regions brought, Which helps, and hallows with its flow, The soothing lyre. Grace through the trembling strings has wrought, Grace that our peace so dearly bought, And still delights to cheer our woe With thrills that make the spirit glow, And link to elevating thought The soothing lyre. XLIX. SOWING. Not all in vain good seed I sow As up and down the world I go, Scattering in faith the precious grain, And waiting till the sun and rain Of Heavenly influence bid it grow. In fields where quiet waters flow, On wolds where freshening breezes blow, My days have passed—on hill and plain— Not all in vain. For as in earth the seed I throw, 'Tis mixed with ceaseless prayer, and though Much ne'er may see the light again, Some fruit of labour will remain, And bending ears shall whisper low, “Not all in vain.” L. ANOTHER YEAR. Another year has passed away With ceaseless flight of day by day; Now lightly winged with happy cheer, Now drooping with regret and fear, Now sadly dim, now gladly gay. Up the swift stream in thought I stray, And on its marge a moment stay, Then leave, with praises in God's ear, Another year. Onward once more I plod my way, And as the New Year looms, I pray— Lord, only let Thy will be clear, Thy Truth be loved, Thy Presence near, Peace will be with me, come what may, Another year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS. I. FROSTED TREES. Oh, what a goodly and a glorious show! The stately trees have decked themselves with white, And stand transfigured in a robe of light; Wearing for each lost leaf a flake of snow. The rising sun shines through them with a glow Of gold amid the silver; while a bright But hapless bird comes fluttering into sight, Amazed at the wan world above, below. What was the ivory house which Ahab made, Compared with Nature's fretwork rich and rare, In every grove with lavish wealth displayed? And oh, if frozen mist appears so fair, How will those “many mansions” be arrayed, Which Love is fashioning in celestial air! III. THE SWAN. The patient swan sits on her island-nest, And hears the waters as they coldly flow, Nor shrinks from rain that beats, or winds that blow, Enduring all with an unruffled breast. Under her wings her silent hopes are prest; She notes not days and nights as on they go, But waits contentedly through gloom or glow Week after week, till her fond heart is blest. What though yon screen of glistening willows ring With dulcet voices of the opening year, And warblers fresh from warmer regions sing As if our cloudy skies they fain would clear? A downy chirp beneath her brooding wing Is the one music to her listening ear. IV. YEWBERRIES ON THE SNOW. I stood beneath a mighty yewtree's shade, Which spread its circling branches o'er the snow: Myriads of scattered rubies lay below, And rosy spangles on the whiteness made. Nature, with frosty fingers, had arrayed The earth in beauty which Art could not show— A dazzling robe of intermingled glow, Fair to behold, but soon, alas! to fade. Then of a fairer fadeless robe I thought, In which the red gives lustre to the white, By loving hands of Grace Incarnate wrought: His innocence is as the groundwork bright, The rubies must on Calvary be sought— Blest wedding garment of the sons of light! VI. A LADY'S CHAMBER. One window of her chamber turns its face To catch the first blush of the Orient sun, That ere the shadowy earth her eye has won Bright thankful thoughts of Heaven may find a place. At her West window she can sit and trace Day's setting glories when his course is run, And watch the curtains of the evening spun By rosy fingers with celestial grace. “The sky is red, it will be fair to-morrow!” A sign familiar to the Saviour's eye When He was wandering in a world of sorrow: May sunsets often breathe such prophecy To her who owns this room; and may she borrow Eternal hope from One red evening sky! VIII. DUNMORE WOODS. They heard of it, they found it, in the wood, Psalm cxxxii. 6, Pr. Bk. version. The Ark, the Presence of the Lord of all; Before His glory on their face they fall, And worship Him, the Holy and the Good. And we—have we not found Him, as we stood Amid these pines which rise like pillars tall; And in this leafy temple heard His call, Thrilling the silence of the solitude? When grateful shadows dim the noontide ray, Lo, God is here, and sheds a secret balm; Here still He walketh at the cool of day: The lofty fir-trees sing a quiet psalm, The beeches lisp a soft melodious lay, And on the spirit falls a heavenly calm. IX. HOPE IS THE WINDOW. Hope is the window, whence we fondly gaze, With sparkling eyes, in youth's ecstatic hour, And see the blossoms dancing on the bower, Or gaily bordering life's untravelled ways. Oh, keep that window open all your days! Veil not your hope—it is God's blessèd dower: Be brave and bright, when cloudy troubles lower: Look out—the distance wears a purple haze. Hope is the window, whence, in life's decline, As earth recedes, we strain our wistful eyes: Untried the ocean—steadfast is the Sign— The Cross our hope and anchor, when storms rise; And o'er the waves we see a City shine, Circled with emerald fields and sapphire skies. X. THE SEASIDE IN WINTER. Musing I pace the sad deserted shore: No mimic towers and fortresses appear, With children's happy faces shining near; No voice is heard save Ocean's sullen roar; No prints but mine are left to be smoothed o'er By the incoming tide which fills my ear: Yet still the faithful sunbeams tremble clear From Heaven's blue dome on the sand's sparkling floor. How soon my footsteps will be found alone Tracking the margin of a mightier main; The cherished voices of my children flown, As children's voices never heard again, While nearer, nearer rolls the vast Unknown, And every light but Heaven's is seen to wane. XI. THE SOOTHING OF NATURE. Ruffled by private wrongs and public woes, Too hard, it seemed, for Charity to brook, I wandered to a solitary nook, Brooding upon the world's unkindly blows. There I beheld full many a fresh-blown rose, Which the soft South-wind, passing, gently took, And from their dainty cups the fragrance shook, Soothing the sense and breathing of repose. Beneath my feet a secret fountain gushed, And with a tinkling music ran along, As from green umbrage into light it pushed: And I by Nature's protest sweet and strong Was conquered, and my angry thoughts were crushed By dancing roses and a runnel's song. XII. A PRAYER IN TIME OF TROUBLE. Rule me, O Master, with an iron rod, Rather than rule me not; let Thy strong hand Force my reluctant soul to Thy command, If I refuse Thy guiding eye and nod. Spare not the goad with pricking keenness shod, If wild I start aside or wilful stand: Send the rough East-wind, if Thy breezes bland Win not my soul to love my King and God. For oh! I know Thy service is most sweet, Thy yoke is easy and Thy burden light, Whene'er my will lies captive at Thy feet: O Love, constrain me by thy gracious might, And I with joy my Conqueror will greet, And crown His bleeding brow with garlands bright. XIII. “SOMETHING FOR EVERY DAY.” Something for every day I fain would show Of fruit or blossom to my fostering Sun, Who with His rays of love my love has won To shine each day to Him with answering glow: Some daily footprint of my life below, Still pointing Homewards when my course is run; Some service to my fellow-travellers done, In heightened happiness or lessened woe. One day at once He gives, not a round year; One day at once let me devote to Him, In words and works whose voice is sweet and clear; So shall the gathered notes compose a hymn Which will make music to His listening ear Through all the ranks of chanting Seraphim! XIV. THE MAGNET AND THE MOON. As turns the needle to the unseen pole, At misty midnight or at cloudy noon, And, if awhile it wavers, settles soon— So touch, O Lord, and fix my wavering soul. As day by day the tidal waters roll, Obedient to the motions of the moon, And to her call their gladsome voice attune, So take my thoughts, O Lord, and sway the whole. O strange attraction, O transcendent dower! O mighty magnet of the human will! Fain would I feel its force from hour to hour: And may the current of my being, still Own the compulsion of that skiey Power Who makes it bliss His bidding to fulfil. XV. GLIMPSES. There leafless trees uprear a latticed screen, As high in air their branches interlace, The star of morning shows its radiant face, A moment visible—and then unseen. Through the thick boughs it darts a silvery sheen, And then behind them hides its moving grace: You look, and not a glimmer can you trace, You look again, and lo, an orb serene. Thus through all earthly obstacles that bar Our mortal vision, we may sometimes see Glimpses of One who shineth from afar; And catch in happy moments fitfully His Face who calls Himself “The Morning Star:” Oh, that such gleams could more enduring be! XVI. PRE-INTIMATIONS. Before its umbered foliage left the oak, I saw a tuft of snowdrop-leaves appear, A tiny phalanx with the frequent spear, Which to its windy war too soon awoke. Of comfort and of hope far off it spoke, While Autumn lingered and the skies were clear; And whispered sweetly of the vernal year, Ere from their caves December tempests broke. So sometimes when a wintry grief draws near An unexpected light of hope is seen, Kindly forerunning the experience drear: A holy text puts forth a sudden green To fortify us for the coming fear And bid us look beyond to hours serene. XVII. THE REFLECTION IN THE LAKE. The little lake had smoothed its troubled breast For one bright moment, ere the Autumn-blast Should strip the trees; and in its depths was glassed A stately beech, smooth bole and branching crest. Each crimson plume in which the tree was drest Upon the mirror of the wave was cast: The water took the form, and held it fast, And with the glow the little lake was blest. Like that still water let my spirit be, Another form, another glow to take, Ere life's sweet sunshine shall for ever flee: Nay, each calm morn a mirror let me make To catch the crimson of another Tree, And clasp it fondly like that little lake! XVIII. A THOUGHT IN A GREENHOUSE. I sit at ease as in a tropic bower, While fast and thick the snowflakes eddying fall On grass and shrubs and buttressed garden-wall, And Winter reigns the tyrant of the hour. But in this house of glass each careless flower Puts on its vesture gay, nor hides at all Its gold or azure; and the palm-tree tall Peers at the icicles, and scorns their power. Thus by His Providence, as by a screen Invisible, God shelters His elect That Christian lives may take a heavenly sheen; And blossom forth uninjured and unchecked By earth's bleak winter, while a Hand unseen Bends over them to foster and protect. XIX. THE FIRSTBORN. Last year she moved through hosts of smiling friends, And gifts that rained upon the gracious hour, And loving words more precious, that had power To stir the sadness that with triumph blends. This year above a little cot she bends, And, happy as a bird within its bower, Gazes upon her treasure, her May-flower, Which for all absent loved ones makes amends. Oh, Mother, Father, cherish Heaven's sweet gift; Water that fresh young soul with dews of prayer; And day by day a silent song uplift To that kind Hand which sent the blossom fair; And say, Our thanks we speak not, Lord, but live; To Love who gives so much ourselves we give. XX. “A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM.” Isaiah xi. 6. “A little Child shall lead them.”—See Him lie In utter weakness on His Mother's knee, Who in His eyes, as in a well, may see, When none else seeth, starry mysteries high. Sinless He is, and yet I hear Him sigh: Pure as fresh-fallen snow, and yet not free From touch of suffering which He bears for me, Answering the angels' song with sorrow's cry. Who can resist that Everlasting Child? Shall He not lead us with His gentle eye, Shall He not rule us with His sceptre mild? Perforce we lay our harsher natures by, Though fierce as leopards, and as lions wild, And kiss His feet and own His sovereignty! XXI. ON A DOVE WHICH FLEW AGAINST MY STUDY WINDOW. Belated, and bewildered in the dark, A snow-white dove against my window flew, Which raising soft, I pulled the flutterer through, As Noah once into the sheltering ark. The ruddy firelight was the luminous mark Which to my room the wingèd wanderer drew; As rosy cloudlets up against the blue, Before the sunrise, beckon to the lark. I thought of my sweet dove, launched on life's foam, And how her heart upon a gentle sigh, Ofttimes at eve to her old nest might roam: Oh, rather let our longings upward fly, While, sundered here, we seek the same bright Home, Mounting like larks with music to the sky! XXII. A CONFIRMATION. To clothe the hidden wish in open act, And thy heart's King, in sight of all, to own; To place Him gladly on His chosen throne, And yield the public homage which He lacked: To hear Him whisper, in a solemn pact, Thy Lord will never leave His child alone, Thy every want to Him is fully known, His every word to thee is blessèd fact: Such mutual pledges are exchanged this day, Such heavenly sunshine greets the dew of youth; Oh may the light and freshness ever stay, And buds of hope unfold in flowers of truth: Lord, lay on this dear head Thine unseen hand, Bid this young life in faith and love expand! XXV. ON AN OLD UPRAISED SEA-BEACH IN DUNMORE PARK. What lessons high this moss-grown rock may teach— The peaceful centre of a pleasure-ground, Where flowering shrubs fling rosy lights around, And Church and mansion stand in easy reach! Once, ere our earth was soothed with human speech, This selfsame rock o'erlooked old Ocean's bound, And heard the loud-voiced billows here resound, Chafing in vain against the rugged beach. But those wild waves were long ago withdrawn, And in their stead the tasselled forest-tree Whispers o'er winding walk and grassy lawn: And through the tumult of Life's tossing sea Bids us anticipate the golden dawn When care shall merge in sweet tranquillity. XXVI. ON VISITING ARRAN AND LOCHGOIL-HEAD. Not the peaked summit of the vast Goatfell, And varying glories that round Arran throng, Or the endless purple vista of Loch Long, So deeply graven on my memory dwell, As those converging hills which grandly swell Round Lochgoilhead; and form a barrier strong, Through which a torrent brawls the rocks among, Undying minstrel of the heathery dell. For on this scene a Poet's The late Charles Tennyson-Turner. eyes have smiled, Whose graceful songs, fresh from a gracious heart, Have many a meditative hour beguiled; And though his cultured Muse was not the child Of mist and mountain, yet his genial art Sheds a soft lustre o'er this landscape wild. XXVII. ON THE MOUNTAINS ROUND LOCH SHIEL, As seen from Glencripisdale. I see the shining mountains which enfold Within their mighty arms a secret glen, Where, generations since, brave loyal men Flocked round their Prince in his adventure bold. Those sunlit peaks stand as they stood of old, And flash the historic Past upon my ken; The clansmen muster as they mustered then; I hear their shouts, their ardour I behold. And then I muse on heights of dear renown Where, centuries since, another Prince was seen, Who came to seek from loving hearts a crown: Those sacred hills still speak of what has been, And through the ages pass the Story down Of dying Grace, triumphant and serene. XXVIII. TO A FRIEND ABOUT TO RESIDE IN JERUSALEM. Favoured your feet, to tread where Jesus trod, Bearing our burden up the Dolorous Way; Or 'mid the trees which stooped to hear Him pray; Or where His footsteps pressed the mountain sod. Favoured your eyes, to see the lilies nod The selfsame beauteous crowns as on the day He paused to praise their royal robes, and say— Mark how they preach the loving care of God. Methinks His breath hath sweetened all the air Which woos green Olivet and Zion's hill; The sky He looked on needs must be more fair: But oh, His blessèd Presence lingers still Round those grey walls, and you may meet Him there In holy work or worship, at your will. XXIX. ON MY BLUE HARE, Ten weeks after it was caught on a mountain near Loch Sunart. Cut off from all communion with its kind, Who by far Sunart's waters roam at will, And range the rocky summits of the hill, As free and restless as the mountain-wind;— Dreams it of breezy pleasures left behind, As by my hearth it sits alone and still? Do visions of its wild companions fill The chambers of its ruminating mind? What are its wondering, wildered thoughts of me, As with enquiring eye it reads my face, Or with a graceful bound leaps on my knee, And feels the tenderness of my embrace? How puzzled and perplexed its brain must be, In man, its age-long foe, a friend to trace! XXX. ON MY BLUE HARE BEGINNING TO TURN WHITE. Dear little exile from thy native hills, Condemned, I ween, to no unhappy doom— With cozy box, and comfortable room Round which to gambol as thy humour wills; When the hoarse murmur of the tempest fills The outer air in Autumn's deepening gloom, This still retreat is better than the boom Of waterfalls, or rushing mountain-rills: And when on those wild northern summits lie The drifts, and Winter-stars are all aglow, Here by the fire thy fur shines sleek and dry; Of cold discomfort nothing dost thou know; Yet thy blanched feet seem to my wondering eye As if they had been dipped in sudden snow! XXXI. A LESSON OF TRUST. I learn to trust from this dear Highland Hare, Which lays its gentle head upon my arm, And dozes on my knee without alarm, As if it slumbered in its native lair. Far from its heathery home and mountain air— How comes it that it never dreams of harm? What has subdued its fear? What potent charm Commands this confidence so sweet and rare? Love, true and constant, is the only spell; Kindness of act and feeling, voice and eye, Has won its timorous heart to trust me well: Nor will I doubt my Benefactor high, Whose kindnesses are more than I can tell, But trustful on His loving arm will lie! XXXII. SWEET THOUGHTS AND SAD THOUGHTS, Suggested by the death of my tame blue hare. Sweet thoughts it brought me of its Highland home— Untrodden hills fragrant with purple heather, Cliffs where an eagle might have dropt a feather, And woody hollows where the red deer roam; Fissures where swollen burns thunder and foam, And waterfalls clap their white hands together; Peaks which like giants loom in misty weather, Or shine like pillars of the unclouded dome. Dear silent captive, did some secret craving Trouble its lonely heart by my fireside, Some dream of windy heights and torrents raving? Pined it for natural joys perforce denied, For fern and myrtle in the free air waving, Till on such sad thoughts brooding, lo! it died? XXXIII. ON THE DEATH OF “BLUEY,” MY HIGHLAND HARE. O'er my poor dying pet I breathed a sigh, And stroked its smooth fur with caressing hand Of pity, which it seemed to understand, And answer with its melancholy eye. I thought of birds and beasts that creep to die In many a lonely corner of the land, Amid still woods and mountains wild and grand, With no kind touch of help or solace nigh. “O pain and death,” I cried, “what a dark pall Ye spread o'er this fair world and creatures bright, Whose innocence might shield them from your thrall:’ But lo! the gloom is pierced by soothing light— “Without your Father not one life shall fall;” “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” XXXIV. ST. JOHN AND THE PARTRIDGE. The favoured Saint who leaned upon the breast Of that Incarnate Grace, which he adored;— The glorious Seer who as an eagle soared Upon the wings of meditation blest; At times relaxing from high thought, caress'd A gentle partridge, as old books record; Stroked its soft plumes, and o'er its beauty pored; Or to his bosom those bright pinions press'd. Did he recall the Master's word, “Behold The birds of air which neither sow nor reap”— To fortify his faith as he grew old? Or did he love his dazzled eyes to steep In Nature's softer tints of brown and gold, Which o'er the fields and through the azure sweep? XXXV. THE BLACK ROCK; Or, The Mountain above Laudale, Loch Sunart. Right up, as if to touch the sky, it towers, A mighty frowning mass, with many a seam On its dark brow, graved deep by rushing stream— Stern chronicle of Nature's wildest hours. Shadowed by hanging woods the mountain lowers Even at noontide, like a dreadful dream— Taking no brightness from the summer gleam, Shedding no lustre from its shaggy bowers. But lo! a fair white bird, with sunlit wings, Across the mountain's gloomy bosom glides, And a relieving ray of gladness brings: So, past those awful heights where Judgment hides, Grace, like an angel flies—and flying, sings; And hopeless fear in grateful love subsides. XXXVII. ON A GLEN WITHOUT A NAME (Leading to Iris Bay, Loch Sunart). From mighty mountains and the vast expanse Of azure loch, I bend my frequent way To a green glen, where on the hazel-spray Reflected lights from tinkling waters dance. On myriad birchen leaves the sunbeams glance, And here and there through tangled umbrage stray, Seeking the burn which lilts its pleasant lay— Now hid, now seen again, by happy chance. Wearied with heights and depths and prospects wide, The soul requires some green secluded nook, Where, by cool waters, it may rest and hide: And from afar to this melodious brook, Whose nameless waves through glen all nameless glide, Oft I shall turn with a fond backward look. XXXVIII. ORANSAY; Or, Oran's Island at the entrance of Loch Sunart. A golden memory of old Time has crowned The bare and lonely brow of Oransay: For here a Saint was wont to kneel and pray, And seek the Presence which makes holy ground. The halo of his name has lingered round While thirteen centuries have ebbed away: Grace, like a rock, continues in one stay, When glory, like the mist, is nowhere found. Along the winding coast of Sunart fair Oran would bend his course with sail or oar, Lifting the Cross of Jesus everywhere: Nor from his labours and his prayers forebore Till called Columba's resting-place to share, And sing high songs with him for evermore. XXXIX. A FAREWELL TO GLENCRIPISDALE. My farewell morning at the Glen—I pace Once more this sheltered grove of murmuring pine, And give God thanks in Nature's sylvan shrine For all the pleasures of this happy place. What days upon the mountains I retrace, What elevating moments have been mine; Where falling waters thunder as they shine, And tufted heather sheds a purple grace. What quiet musings in my lonely tower, What genial talks with hospitable friends, While mirth and charity divide the hour: O fair Glencripisdale, thy praise transcends A sonnet's compass, and thy name has power To rule the heart where hope with memory blends. XL. ULLESWATER UNDER A CLOUD. Nature we thought to see in all her bloom— The mountains smiling in their summer pride, And mirrored softly in the waters wide, Which the sun's rays to their blue depths illume. But lo! instead the awful summits loom Through mists and darkness which their beauties hide; And showers, which rush along, and yet abide, Encompass them as with the clouds of doom. Yet Nature in her wrathful mood can charm, And fascinate us with her wildest form; The soul exults in an Almighty arm Which clothes itself in splendour of the storm; And learns her deepest lesson in the hour When Love stands veiled in majesty and power. XLI. ON SEEING SOME BIRDS IN WINTER Feeding at the Study Window of the Rev. F. O. Morris, Nunburnholme Rectory. Trust him, ye gentle birds, of various wing: Flock to his window, flutter round your friend: Through these inclement days ye may depend On his prompt hand the punctual crumbs to bring. And oh, remember when, in sunny Spring, Your earliest lays to bounteous Heaven ascend, Some grateful notes for Christmas fare to blend, And at your patron's casement sweetly sing. For not alone when gusts of Winter blow He loves you, but through all the changing year; To his kind care thanks manifold ye owe; His voice secures for you a nation's ear; Then trust him when the air is thick with snow, And warble to him when the skies are clear. XLII. AFTER READING TENNYSON'S “IDYLLS OF THE KING.” I listened to our Nightingale of song Amidst his Laurel leaves, till I was stirred To my heart's depths by the sweet strains I heard, So lofty, so melodious, and so strong. Then rose the questioning thought, Why should I wrong The ears of men, like some thin-piping bird, With chiming sonnet and with rhyming word, When such a voice resounds the woods among? Came the reply, God made the nightingale— God made the chiff-chaff also, with its twain Small notes monotonous that never fail, The summer through, in copse and country lane— Gladness and gratitude their ceaseless tale, To God's ear pleasing as that higher strain! XLIII. ON A FERN-LEAF Given to me at Aldworth, Haslemere, the Poet Laureate's Home. Graceful memorial of a favoured hour Spent in the sylvan walks of Haslemere! Dear art thou for thy beauty, but more dear For thy green birthplace near a Poet's bower: His wondrous touch can make a leaf or flower More precious than a spray of gold appear; And wayside ferns and hedgerow weeds that hear His daily footsteps own the enchanter's power. Lo, to his house the emulous leaves have flown, And woven round its walls a garland fine Of varied foliage, sculptured fair in stone. But what strange blossoms with those leaves entwine? “Glory to God” shines like a rose fresh-blown, “Peace and goodwill” like fragrant eglantime! Round Mr. Tennyson's house, built by himself, runs a band of leaves interlacing the inscription, in Latin, “Glory to God in the highest; on earth peace, goodwill toward men.” XLIV. ON AN AVENUE AT GRASBY VICARAGE, Planted by the Rev. Charles Tennyson-Turner. Where larch and poplar intercept the dew Above a Poet's grassy walk, I strayed, Tracing the path his frequent steps had made. Himself had planned the pillared avenue With glimpse of field and spire and distant blue, And music soft by unseen fingers played Above me, as light airs the branches swayed, Which at my feet the dancing shadows threw. Ah, this is but a symbol, I exclaim: Our Poet owns a fairer grove of Song, Where the leaves flutter to the breath of Fame And loving feet shall always move along: While, on each side, sweet pictures charm the eye, Green nooks of earth or gleams of azure sky. XLV. IN MEMORY OF CHARLES TENNYSON-TURNER, July 4th, 1879—His Birthday. With wreaths of love we crown thy natal day, Though thou hast vanished from thy fellowmen, The sweet voice silenced, and the ready pen, With all it might have painted, put away. Never again to us will light-winged lay New beauties waft, caught by thy subtle ken, Nor to our longing ears ever again New music from thy cunning harp will stray. But still thy gentle presence seems to brood O'er the dim distance of the azure wold, O'er summer cornfield, and o'er lonely wood: Still in thy books communion I can hold With all that is most lovely, true, and good, And feel thy spirit stir me as of old. XLVI. LAST LOOKS, In Memory of F. R. Havergal. As when ascending some steep wooded height One traveller leaves his fellows far behind, Urged upwards by a sky-aspiring mind, Till sunrise on his eager face shall smite: Silent he stands transfigured by the sight, And lifted for awhile above his kind: But one by one they too Morn's kiss shall find, Who struggle after him from dark to bright. So in the light which filled our sister's eyes, As calm she stood upon life's topmost peak, We hail the glow of opening Paradise; And, pressing on, we follow, faint and weak, Through cares and duties to the restful skies, Where we shall see the glory that we seek. XLVII. ON THE SWORD OF A FRENCH NAVAL OFFICER, A Trophy of the time of Nelson. A symbol keen of “sorrow on the sea,” Of thrilling silence after thunders loud, Of a brave spirit in disaster bowed, Unequal to contend, unused to flee. Bright token of a glorious victory, A sudden gleam of exultation proud, As when a crescent moon through drifting cloud Sends forth a flash of silver radiancy. Victor and vanquished long ago are dust, But still their gladness and despair we trace Engraved on steel and unconcealed by rust: May we grasp well life's sword by God's good grace, And with a hero-hand maintain our trust, Then find our trophies in a happier place. XLVIII. ON THE PROPOSED RESTORATION OF LONDESBOROUGH CHURCH By the same Architect who restored George Herbert's Church at Bemerton. He who with careful eye and skilful hand Has propt the mouldering shrine where Herbert prayed, That shrine by holy songs immortal made, Whose incense has been blown o'er sea and land; With the same artist touch and glance has scanned These walls and piers and buttresses decayed, That strengthened, and with beauty new arrayed, Our House of God through rolling years may stand. Oh, pleasing is the link which joins the name Of one so gracious and so sweet with mine: What though I cannot emulate the fame Of his rare harp and inspiration fine; His life I yet may copy, free from blame And wholly spent in offices Divine. XLIX. THE MIRROR OF THE WORD (After Reading the Revised Version of the New Testament). I gazed into a mirror large and grand: A landscape, unlike ours, was in it glassed; A Man, but more than man, across it passed, Pointing to birds and lilies with His hand. Before the bright reflection as I stand A holy peace is o'er my spirit cast; I see a vision of the First and Last, I hear a voice of sweet supreme command. Methought some specks and stains had gathered there, Veiling in parts those lineaments Divine, But love removed the mist with quick-eyed care: More clearly now we view the great design, With fewer flaws upon the mirror fair, Where limned for ever Truth and Beauty shine. L. THE CHURCH REOPENING WEEK. It flashes on me like a Heavenly dream— That stately tower which seems to touch the sky; The frequent service and the anthem high; Fair arch, ribbed roof, stringed lights with starry beam: Lone musings by the clear, swift-flowing stream Which through the level pastures glances by; Greetings of friends and converse “eye to eye,” And old affections warmed with kindlier gleam. A shadow sweet of New Jerusalem joy, On the green borders of the crystal river; Where love shall muse, and no vain thoughts annoy, And friends shall meet, whom nought again can sever; Where nobler worship shall our tongues employ, And crown with praise the Name of names for ever. VALEDICTORY. Sungleams of earth and heaven, they come to all: Not only where the forest interlaces Its leafy boughs, and in sweet rural places; About the feet of city crowds they fall. They beam upon us from the pictured wall, They smile in books, they glow in friendly faces; Weaving round hearth and home their fairest traces, In humble cottage or ancestral hall. Oh, that the pages of this little Book Might be as Sungleams, lonely hearts to brighten— Singing and shining like a Summer brook: Oh, that some load of trouble they might lighten, Suggest a hopeful thought, an upward look, And silent aspirations serve to heighten!</field>
