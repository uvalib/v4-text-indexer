TO MY HONORABLE Frend Sir Water Ralegh Knight, Seneshall and Chancelor of the Duchie of Cornwal &amp; Exon, Lord Warden of the Stanneries, and her Maiesties Lieffetenant of the Countie of Cornwall, &amp;c. A sparke of Friendship and warme goodwill. Where Friendship findes, good ground to growe vpon, It takes sound roote, and spreads his braunches out: Brings foorth fayre fruite, though spring be past and gon, And blowmeth where, no other grayne will sprout: His flow'rs are still, in season all the yeere, His leaues are fresh, and greene as is the grasse, His sugred seedes, good cheape and nothing deere, His goodly barke, shines bright like gold or brasse: And yet this tree, in breast must needes be shrinde, And liues no where, but in a noble minde. A DISCRIPTION And playne discourse of paper, and the whole benefites that Paper brings, with rehersall and setting foorth in verse a Paper myll, built nere Darthford, by an high Germaine, called Master Spilman. Ieweller to the Queenes Maiestie. When sence of man, sought out what Science was, And found each Art, through wit and study great, Before long proofe, could bring great thinges to passe, In iudging head, did many a hammer beat: But triall had, experience prooued good, for practise skill, on certaine surety stoode: Then ignorance blinde, gaue learned knowledge place, so studious minde, gaynde glory, wealth and grace. Some searcht for gold, and digd deepe Caues in ground, and some sought pearle, and precious Iewels gay, Some saylde the seas, and wandred world full round, to bring home goods, that should the charges pay. Some made fine silkes, and veluets fayre and rich, inuention still, was dayly vsde so much, That each deuice, that coulde be put in proofe, was set abroach, and tried for mans behoofe. But sure some Arts, doth so surmount the rest, that famous were, the authors of the same, Whose noble acts, their worth so well exprest that writers pen, shoulde but ecclips their fame. Looke throughly then, on that our elders did, and bring to light, their secrete knowledge hid, And yeelde them lawde, as their deserts doth craue, for I in hand, another matter haue. I prayse the man, that first did paper make, the onely thing that sets all vertues forth: It shoes newe bookes, and keepes old workes awake, much more of price, than all this world is worth: It witnesse beares of frendship, time and troth, and is the tromp of vice and vertue both, Without whose helpe, no hap nor wealth is won, and by whose ayde, great workes and deedes are done. It flies from friend and foe in letter wise, and serues a state, and kingdome sundry wayes, It makes great winde, where neuer dust doth rise, and breedes some stormes, in smoothest sommer dayes. It telles of warre, and peace as things fall out, and brings by time, ten thousand things about. For schollars fit, and merchants all alike, for plowe men good, that digs and delues the dike, For good Deuines, and lawyers not amisse, for Saylers too, and those that trauell farre, For Students best, that knowes what learning is, for pleaders meete, for men of peace or warre, For all degrees that are of manly kinde, a right good meane, that may expresse the minde, A needefull thing, that no good wit may want, a thing moste vsde, yet neuer will be skant. What man, or sex, or shape of worthy molde, can paper lacke, but buies it lesse or more? Things present are, in paper long enrolde, so things to come, and things long past before. Though partchment duer, a greater time and space, yet can it not, put paper out of place: For paper still from man to man doth go, when parchment comes in few mens hands, you knowe. If paper be, so precious and so pure, so fitte for man, and serues so many wayes, So good for vse, and wil so well endure, so rare a thing, and is so much in prayes: Than he that made, for vs a paper mill, is worthy well, of loue and worldes good will. And though his name, be Spillman by degree, yet Help-man nowe, he shall be calde by mee. Sixe hundred men, are set a worke by him, that else might starue, or seeke abroad their bread. Who nowe liues well, and goes full braue and trim, and who may boast, they are with paper fed. Straunge is that foode, yet straunger made the same, Spillman, Help-man, so rightly call the same: For greater help, I gesse he cannot giue, than by his help, to make poore folke to liue. Fewe helps these dayes, to bring vs any wealth, some sundry wayes, doe still more harme then good: So such as help, doe breede good bloud and health: and in best part, ought well be vnderstoode. If paper mill, helps poore and harmes no rich, the gayne is great, and the inuention much, The worke not small, the labor worth the viewe, because old Art, is nowe reuiude a newe. One Thirlby went, Embassador farre from hence, Byshop of Ely. to Charles the fift, an Emperour of great fame, And at returne, did bring with him from thence, a learned man, Remigius by name. Who Thirlby loude, and made by his deuise, a paper mill, but not so much in price, As this that nowe, neere Darthford standeth well, Where Spillman may, himselfe and houshold dwell. Well this is he, that first heere profite brought, first triall made, of thinges not heere well knowne: First framde the forme, that sundry paper wrought, first tooke in hand, by charges of his owne A doubtfull worke, that others earst begun, Who spent thereon more wealth then well they won, This man alone, the substance shewes so right, that all the rest, were Lampes that gaue no light. The mill it selfe, is sure right rare to see, the framing is, so queint and finely done, Built all of wood, and hollowe trunkes of tree, that makes the streames, at point deuice to runne, Nowe vp, now downe, now sideward by a sleight, nowe forward fast, then spouting vp on height, As Conduits colde, coulde force so great a heate, that fire shoulde flame, where thumping hammers beat. The Hammers thump, and make as lowde a noyse, as Fuller doth, that beates his wollen cloth, In open shewe, then sundry seceete toyes, makes rotten ragges, to yeelde a thickned froth: Then is it stampt, and washt as white as snowe, then flong on frame, and hangd to dry I trow: Thus Paper streight, it is to write vpon, as it were rubde, and smoothde with slicking stone. Through many handes, this Paper passeth there, before full forme, and perfect shape it takes, Yet in short time, this Paper yncke will beare, whereon in haste, the workeman profit makes. A wonder sure, to see such ragges and shreads, passe dayly through, so many hands and heads, And Water too, that Papers enmy is, yet Paper must, take forme and shape from this. This Water doth, not onely driue the mill, but giues it grace, and makes it fine and fayre, Is cause and ground, to giue it fashion still, for it is made, with Water, winde and ayre. And takes his forme of compoundes mixed well, wherein there doth, a secreate nature dwell: A heauenly power, that earth and ayre hath knit, by cunning Art, and worke of humane wit. For cloth and silke, and mettalles fine or bace, are wrought of thinges, that haue a substance great, This findeth forme, and stampe in straunger cace, as Water mill, made rags and shreds to sweate. Of whose thick froth, a creame or crudde should rise, that shoulde take shape, and strength by breath of skyes: Though sure a meane, there is to worke the same, some secrete cause, brings Paper first in frame. As corne is sowne, and there must rotte in grounde, before it blade, or takes good roote or strength, Then reapt and thrasht, and to the myll full rounde, is sent to grinde, and made good dow at length, Then kneaded well, then bakte and made good bread, so paper sure, through many a hand and head Doth passe like drosse, that of it selfe is nought, till it be tried, by skill and throughly wrought. From drosse commes gold, when fier hath searcht it well, so all thinges haue, their worth from some great cause: The pearle some say, is fetcht from oysters shel, thus each thing yeeldes, to Art and natures lawes. As fier from slint, through stroake of steele we finde, so world may see, what wonders worketh kinde. Glasse was at first, as straunge to make or vewe, as Paper nowe, that is deuisde of newe. Of newe I meane, in England saue one man, that had great wealth, and might much treasure spare. Who with some charge, a Paper mill began, and after built, a stately worke moste rare. The Royall exchaunge, but got by that more gayne, than he indeede, did loose by former payne. But neither he, nor none before his dayes, made Paper mill, that merits so much prayse. As this that nowe, is not full farre from hence, where Water ranne, in waste and vaine a way, Nowe profit yeeldes, and brings in poundes and pence, that quittes the cost, and doth the charge defray. This had not bene, if Prince had not retained, the straunger heere, by whome these giftes are gayned: Her highnesse than, sawe in her deepe foresight, what famous worke, this man coulde bring to light. The glory then, and honor of this deede, is hers, and ours, shall be the gayne therein. We reape the Corne, whoeuer sowde the seede, who ere haue lost, we shall be sure to winne. This mill remaynes, a sampler to the rest, that after comes, to shewe whose worke is best, No doubt but some, this course will followe on, a straunger left, this worke to looke vpon. That many moe, by this may builded be, and many heads, and handes may thriue thereby, He merits much, that first plants fruitfull tree, they purchase prayer, that first doth practises try. They ought not reap, that neuer ment to sowe, they winne great hap, that can through hazards go, They lose no time, that toyles for publike state, they glory gayne, that first a conquest gate. Nowe gallant witts, that ioyes in doing well, ply pen a pace, whiles learning may be had, Now stripplings yong, but late come out of shell, to Schoole good boyes, to make your parents glad. Now Printers presse, that sets foorth many a booke, besturre the stampe, that worlde for newes may looke, Now Stationers, that worketh all the yeere, sell bookes good cheape, for Paper is not deere. Nowe writers graue, that studies heauenly things, your workes shall shine, by meane of Papers grace: Nowe Marchant wise, that home great profit brings, send letters out, abroad to euery place. For Paper doth, present it selfe to those, in common weale, that writeth verse and prose, The merry myll, nowe grindes and goes so braue, that worlde at will, shall alwayes Paper haue. When Paper was, not throwly knowne of men, they wrote in stones, and barks of trees for shift, But loe long since, the Paper and the Pen, by deepe deuice, found out a finer drift. And most to prayse, because of trifling toyes, so great a wealth, our worthy world enioyes, Of drosse and rags, that serues no other meane, and fowle bad shreds, comes Paper white and cleane. And euen so, the baddest people may, became good folke, if they will bide the stampe, Which people first, with many a worthy way, must be well wrought, like oyle that burnes in Lampe. For Oyle is tried, and pur'd eare it be solde, and searcht throw out, as fyre tries out the golde, And when the oyle, is fit to blaze or burne, it is applied, at neede to serue our turne. So man is meete, to serue his natiue soyle, when thumping worlde, abroad hath tried him throwe, Or heere at home, his life hath scaped foyle, and he thereby, may shew a blotlesse browe. But this must be, as Paper passeth mill, mans doubtfull dayes, must passe through perilles still, And though great blowes, do beat him backe a space, hee bides the brunt, to get the greater grace. And yeeldes to thumps, and thwartes as yce to thawe, as frost to fier, will soft and gentle ware: Or as stiffe neckes, will stoupe and yeelde to lawe, compelde by flame, to yeelde to fire like flare. For nothing more, becomes a noble minde, than bide the blastes, and puffe of euery winde, Whose bellowes blowes, to hinder well wonne fame, when doe well shall, in spight possesse good name. If ship passe storme, and tries the surging seas, comes quiet home, to harber in a roade, Man must of force, through torment purchase ease, and must beleeue, great burthen is no load. And so bace ragges, whereof is no account, through straining hard, past tenter hookes may mount, And bodie tost, and tumbled vp and downe, may come to rest, and reap right rare renowne. Mans secrete faultes, and foule defects of minde, must be reformde, like ragges in Paper mill, When hammers help, hath changde his cankered kinde, and clensde the heart, from spots and former ill. A second shape, and forme full fresh and new he doth receiue, in nature grace and hiew. When Water streames hath washt him ouer quite, than man becomes, like paper faire and white. If Water were as scant as deerest wine, how should this world mainteine each science heere? In Water thin there dwels a power diuine, where face is seene, as in a Christall cleere. An Element that euery creature needes, wherein full oft both fowle and fishes breedes: Whereby a world of people daily liue, and God to man doth manie a blessing giue. What earth or soyle can flourish where it wants? colde Water sweete doth coole the scalded brest, The drops whereof doth comfort hearbes and plants, and graces great by Water is possest. Then muse not man, if Water thee reforme, that art but earth, and foode for scraling worme, A bladder pufte with winde and ayer full thinne, that can not bide the push of baggage pinne. Our finest coyne of siluer or of golde in grossest sort is handled as ye knowe, And beaten long, and thumped treble folde before it doth for currant money goe. The wollen cloth that from the walkemill comes, at first must passe, through manie handes and thums: Yea washt and walkt with Water where it goth, ere it do take his breadth and thicknes both. What linnen, lawne, or cambricke can be white, if Water do not throughly wash the same: It scowres that cleane, that is as dunne as Kyte, and brings fowle cloth in perfect forme and frame. All slubbred things must needes be washt anue, fowle things are nought, if prouerbe olde be true. Thus prooue I plaine, by course of Water mill, and hammering world, mens manners changeth still. Though some do say, in France and other place, are Paper mils, as fayre and straunge as this, Whats that to vs, this giues our Country grace, and to all Kent, a double honor is. That in the soyle, was borne our worthy Queene, by straungers meane, so straunge a worke is seene: And straungers are, so glad with straunge deuice, to serue and please, our Prince of peerelesse price. In other Realmes, there milles are not in woorth, scarce halfe so good, the proofe may well be founde, This is so fine, with workmanship set foorth, so surely built, and planted in the ground. That it doth seeme, a house of some estate, a Mill moste rare, a worke deuisde of late, Whose goodnesse great, exceedes the outward showe, and from whose stampe, shall publike profite flowe. And troth to tell, the mill is blacke and white, and Water doth worke all the Paper there, The sight thereof, shall breede more rare delight, than man with eye, beholdes in many a where. This somewhat more, may moue a maruell heere, no profite may, be reapt in many a yeere, The author than, of this newe Paper Mill, bestowes great charge, and gaynes but worldes goodwill. Death may preuent, his hope and purpose too, death cuts off all, from him if it so hap, If losse so fall, what then shall Spilman doe, but so receiue, the losses in his lap. This daunger great, deserneth some regard, or of the worlde, doth merit some reward, Giue him good speech, (as reason doth require, yeelde duety, so the labror hath his hire. An high Germaine he is as may be prooude, In Lyndo am Bodenze borne and bred: And for this Mill may heere be truly loude and praysed too, for deepe deuice of head. But if the hope of gaine quit not the cost, the world will iudge his labour is but lost. To hazards hap he doth commit the same, and seemes as yet to care for naught but Fame. Wealth, wit and time, with toyle and trauaile great, he plyes a pace, and spareth for no charge, The Mill goes round, the workmen moyle and sweate, the streame goes straight, that earst ranne all at large, The wheeles conueyes the Water diuers wayes, the Hammers thump, the stamp but seldome stayes: The ragges and clowts, becomes as white as snowe, and all these knackes, the master needes must knowe. Whose purse, whose paynes, and purpose is not small, whose plot, points out, a peece of worke right fayre, To hinder none, but made to please vs all, to which braue Mill, do thousandes still repayre. To see what things, are wrought by cunning skill, to Gods great prayse, and Princes honor still, And to the place, and soyle where it doth stand, a goodly grace, and Paper neere at hand. Loe heere how man to paper is comparde, that readie is to take both stampe and print Through triall great, and manie a passage hard, more stiffe than steele that strikes out fire from flint: But though most hard the path and passage be, in the right way it sets man franke and free: That hath bene brought in bondage from his birth, and makes him seeme a little God on earth. Full fraught with wit, with Art and science great, with learned lore, with skill and knowledge deepe, With giftes diuine, that feares not fortunes threat, with quick deuice, that can both get and keepe, With reason such, as rules each other thing, of Beast and Fowle, the onely Lord and King, A Prince of all the earthly pleasures heere, found out with paine, and bought with trauayle deere.
