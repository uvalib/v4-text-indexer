      <field name="fulltext">TASSO AND THE SISTERS: A CONVERSATION. The relation of the events upon which the two following Poems are founded, may be met with in any Life of Tasso. SCENE. A Room in the Prince of Mantua's Palace—a Harp in the centre. Enter the Prince, Tasso, Isabel, Bertha, Florence. GONZAGA. Let sage Philosophy come fenc'd in proof; O'er her strong armour put the toga on; Gird on her loins the sword of Disputation— Wisdom her shield, her potent weapons Words: And, thus accoutred, let her take the field, Defying opposition:—upon this Send but young Beauty forth, in smiles array'd, And you will see Philosophy grow mute And pale for very shame of her own weakness, Whilst Beauty on her downcast face shall look And laugh in triumph. TASSO. 'Twere a fruitless task To mention ought against fair Beauty's pow'r, Whilst such a host of sparkling eyes are near To prove her sov'reignty, and all I might Urge in good Reason's cause to render vain, Her truth to dulness turning: therefore rail Against Philosophy e'en as you will— I heed her not. GONZAGA. Poor Maiden! she hath lost A strong defender then, and Beauty should Make loud rejoicings, as beseems a victress.— Come, sing to us, sweet Florence! FLORENCE. Nay, my Lord! Let Isabel, or Bertha—I will not: Better than Florence can they please the ear. GONZAGA. Be not so modest, prithee, gentle dame! I pray you sing. FLORENCE. Indeed I cannot now: My voice is unmelodious to-day. GONZAGA. How sweet is soft persuasion to a woman! I pray you sing, sweet Florence! and delight Earth and the air with music not their own, But of the Heavens.—Are you not civil yet? Come—Bertha, Isabel, and Tasso, you, Entreat her for a song. ISABEL. Dear Sister, sing! You never look so well as o'er the harp. BERTHA. Sing, dearest Girl! for we are all athirst For some blest harmony, which you so well Can steep the senses in. TASSO. Kind Florence, sing! Or we shall deem you grown morose of late, And loath to charm. FLORENCE. To Tasso's pray'rs I yield; For when Philosophy doth stoop, 'tis mete That all her fancies should be pleas'd awhile. [She plays and sings. GONZAGA. A pleasing lay, for one that could not sing, Because her voice was most unmusical: Why! the gay lark, forsooth, will soon assert She hath no melody wherewith to greet The skies at morn. But, Bertha! sing you now, And let us know that we have little cause To pay regard to what the lark can do:— Oh! let her warble in Aurora's air, Or sulk upon the ground—the same to us, Whilst such a songstress as fair Bertha lives To glad the earth with sweeter harmony. BERTHA. The prince Gonzaga is poetical, And the so fluent accents of his tongue Must make my following voice but weak appear. What song would'st have? TASSO. Of Echo and the Boy Himself who slew, because he could not clasp His own reflected image in the brook, And turn'd into a flower. BERTHA. My fav'rite one! [She plays and sings. TASSO. The music of your voice did Echo hear, Most lovely Bertha! in repeating all Its sounds of melody, she would forget E'en her Narcissus, and bewail no more. FLORENCE. In troth, she would; and Pan would cease to love The cruel maid in vain, and in her stead Would worship the bright Goddess of these sounds. BERTHA. Now for your song, my Isabel! GONZAGA. Dear girl! Give us a loftier strain than these have sung— I tire of love-notes. ISABEL. Then my song shall be Of merry quality: attend—'tis this. [She plays and sings. GONZAGA. 'Tis well there are no rocks, or quicksands here, For those who listen to such siren notes: Could th' Island-Goddess but have warbled so, Ulysses had not thought of Ithaca, Or his chaste spouse; but near her burning heart His head he still had lain, intoxicate With beauty and with melody! ISABEL. How well A speech for all doth Lord Gonzaga frame! Had sage Ulysses blest Calypso's love With words thus eloquent, she would have died (Immortal tho' she seem'd) whene'er he left Her sea-girt kingdom. See you there, my Lord! Why—these are words as lofty as your own, And true as they. GONZAGA. A wicked girl are you— So in the darkness of your eyes I read. ISABEL. You read it in the darkness of my eye! Are dark eyes wicked then? GONZAGA. I never knew A dark-eyed girl that lov'd not wickedness; Dark eyes are Passion's palaces, and passion— Say, is it virtue, Isabel? ISABEL. But blue— FLORENCE. No treason, Sister! not a word against them: Of innocence do blue eyes ever speak. BERTHA. And truth. FLORENCE. And goodness. GONZAGA. Stay—I thought 'twas thus, Until I gaz'd upon two ladies' eyes Of naughty blue; but since that evil hour I've thought a dark eye has less mischief in't, Than one of azure. BERTHA. Oh! most wicked speech: Let Tasso judge between them, and decide If dark, or blue should have pre-eminence. TASSO. Those seeking justice then must quit the court; Or else the Judge's wisdom would be fixed So much 'twixt lovely light and lighted darkness, That he dare give the preference unto neither— Being spell-bound. ISABEL. Awhile we'll leave you then, Most prudent Judge! your sentence well to weigh, Ere you do speak it. TASSO. That were bootless too; For, ere I could decide, I should require So much of weighty argument to hear On either part, that Time could not afford Enough of his existence for our purpose. GONZAGA. We'll try the cause hereafter. Tasso! now Choose, of this lovely sisterhood, the one With whom you'd tarry; for the other twain With me must come, that it declared may be, The Graces once have parted. FLORENCE. Scrup'lous Judge! See—thou'rt constrained to let your wisdom forth. TASSO. When the three Goddesses, on Ida's top, Appear'd in nakedness divine, to make The Shepherd judge of their eternal beauty— He was a fool the golden prize to yield To one;—he should have made the whole three parts, And given to each a part, rather than bring On his devoted head the wrath of two, To make one prouder of her loveliness. Therefore all three I purpose to detain Of these scarce less than Goddesses, and forth In solitude the Prince of Mantua send. GONZAGA. The envied prize did Paris surely give To Venus, but to rid him of all three Of those his heavenly pleaders,—and 'tis strange That you should covet these mere mortal maids: I gladly leave them, and commit you, Tasso, To a worse fate than that of Ida's boy:— Blue eyes are dang'rous in their innocence, And dark ones apt to lead the soul astray! [Exit. ISABEL. Oh, sacrilegious Lord! TASSO. Spare him, fair Isabel! If you would be reveng'd, you can but close The eyes he dares to rail at. FLORENCE. Dulcet flatterer! Like you these bracelets which my sister wears, Clinging and sparkling round her wrist? TASSO. Why—aye; They glitter bravely—but the arms adorn'd Do far surpass in beauty their adornment; And each bright ornament must shine in vain, When bound on so much whiteness. That blue robe Which Florence wears—came it from Fairyland? ISABEL. 'Tis rumor'd so, and that the Elfin queen Did weave it all herself. TASSO. 'Twas kindly done; For mortal weeds, methinks, but ill would sit On one so sylph-like. BERTHA. True: but, gallant Tasso! I pray you leave me not unnotic'd here, These flowers—do they the color of my hair become; Or would you have them of a darker tint? TASSO. Sure you but wear them to display how poor Are Flora's charms to thine—Oh! shew them not Where gay Favonius may be revelling; Lest he should learn to pass his Mistress o'er With dull indifference, tho' dizen'd out E'en in her May-dress; make her jealous grow, And cover all her kingdom with sad tears, Which men, unweeting of the Goddess' grief, Would take for brightest dew-drops! BERTHA. Tasso loves His cunning Fancy at all hours to show, And, flattering others, proves his own conceit. ISABEL. True, Sister mine! and these fine things he says No doubt he hath a thousand times conn'd o'er, To suit the first occasion. FLORENCE. As a child Its early lessons. TASSO. Prince! your words were true. Oh, happy Son of Hecuba! how blest Thy lot: thy heavenly visitants, for thee, Of smiles and blandishments were full; but mine With cruel words do pierce me to the heart— With most ungracious accusations. BERTHA. Peace! Nor murmur at the fate your speech deserves. But, I beseech you, tell me if these flowers Well with my hair accord. TASSO. So well, in truth, That or a lighter, or a darker shade, Given to one hue, would mar their general beauty— So just and elegant is your discernment. BERTHA. And yours to think so—as a thing of course. ISABEL. I must disturb this parley: it grows late, And we have mischief to contrive at Julia's. FLORENCE. Truly, good lack! 'tis pity, too, to leave The eloquence that flows from Tasso's tongue, For an old woman's prattle. BERTHA. Yes, indeed— And his sincerity, for heartless words That tend to nothing. ISABEL. And the soften'd speech That calls us angels, for mere common talk. Let us e'en weep! TASSO. Sweet Satirists! 'tis I Alone for sorrow that can have good cause, For what avails the eloquence of words When none are near to hear them? FLORENCE. We lament To make you woful—but are forc'd to go. TASSO. Stay yet awhile! I have a casket here, Which holds some trinkets of but little worth, And I would seek to have that worth increas'd In being worn by three such lovely forms: This ring, sweet Isabel! I give to you, To grace it with a place on that fair hand Amongst those other jewels, which outshine Its feeble lustre, as your beauty all. This string of pearls I would have Bertha honor By the mere wearing near her damask cheek, To you, fair Florence, with the laughing eye! This girdle I present, which, when 'tis clasp'd Around your azure vestment, will become More rare and magical than Venus' zone. FLORENCE. Come, all ye Junos! then, and court my favor: My garb's of fairy texture, and this band As Cytherea's powerful.—Give me joy! ISABEL. And me as well: for, see! what radiance dwells Enshrin'd about me! it doth dim the glow Of this bright ring—at least, so Tasso says. BERTHA. Now, Flora! keep your Zephyrus away; Lest he should love among these beads to live, Scorning the splendor of your varied charms. TASSO. Fine sentences, and of th' utterers worthy! Would that the Prince were here, with mete reply T'encounter them. ISABEL. Because, alas! you cannot. Most exquisite Humility! farewell. BERTHA. Pattern of lowliness and truth, farewell! FLORENCE. Meekness personified! farewell. TASSO. Wit, Grace And Loveliness, dress'd out in female forms To captivate the senses, fare ye well! [Exeunt severally. TASSO'S SPIRIT: A SKETCH. SCENE I. A Room in the Palace of Bisaccio. MANSO—TASSO. MANSO. Thou dream'st, Torquato!—thou but dream'st, I say; And the bright Spirit which, thou fondly think'st, Comes from the skies, sweet converse here with thee, Of divers strange and lofty things, to hold, Is the creation of thy mind alone,— Deck'd with a Poet's coloring, and array'd In Fancy's splendid garb. TASSO. Bisaccio! no: 'Tis all reality; tho' most sublime. But yestereven, as I watch'd the Sun Bidding farewell to our Italian skies, (Blue as the eyes of angels!) whilst the Moon Grew joyful at his setting, she appear'd— My own unrivall'd Spirit—beautiful! Oh! hadst thou look'd on her immortal visage, And to her language listen'd, then wouldst thou Have thought henceforth of her alone, and deem'd Earth's loveliest maidens, if with her compar'd, Mean as the rainbow's copy in the Heavens, Arch'd near the rainbow's self. Renew thy scoffs Of jeering unbelief, in merry mood;— But still 'tis so. MANSO. Or comes she mounted high On prancing steed, or sailing thro' the air? Couch'd on a moon-beam, or a falling star? Comes she array'd in naked Beauty's glow, Or cloth'd in purple? Comes she gravely forth, Or laughing blithely at my Tasso's dreams? Comes she in silence, or in music shrin'd? Flush'd as the red cheek'd rose, or meek and pale As its white sister? Prithee, tell me this, That I may know when Spirits cross my path. TASSO. Smiling and bright, at eventide she comes, Like sun-beams o'er the hills, and walketh forth In such deep silence, that where'er she treads The earth seems turn'd to velvet: long she stays, Light o'er my chamber sheds, and we do speak In most unearthly fashion. MANSO. Excellent! A kind, good Sprite, forsooth.—What talk ye of? TASSO. Of what e'en Manso could not comprehend. MANSO. That were a pity, were I near to listen. But then—her voice! like summer winds, no doubt, Divinely gentle:—thunder it is not, Or I ere this had heard the lofty sounds. TASSO. Of this, I do beseech thee, speak no more: 'Tis profanation thus to think of beings So far ourselves above. MANSO. Now, tell me, Tasso Dost really deem that thou art favor'd so Of Heaven, that one of its immortal race Doth leave its glories to converse with thee On this low earth? TASSO. Angels love Poesy, And with my friendly Spirit I converse In language, not as with my fellow men, But, all poetical: what we speak of Is nothing earthly; nor feel I of the earth In our sublime communion, but her words Lift me to Heaven—and we expatiate there! MANSO. God help thee, Poet! thou art craz'd, for sure. [aside. Thy tale is wondrous, Tasso—and so wondrous, That, till I witness this encounter strange, I cannot give it credence. TASSO. That thou shalt: Unto my chamber, at the sunset, come; And thou shalt see such things, and listen to Converse so wild—impassion'd, that thy doubts To much astonishment will all give way. MANSO. At sunset, then? TASSO. At sunset—in my chamber. [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Tasso's Bedchamber. Tasso is seen gazing intently towards the Window. Enter Manso. MANSO. Now do I look for wonders! 'Tis the hour When thou, Torquato, step'st into the clouds— Hath she already been, that thou dost stare At yonder window thus? TASSO. Dost thou not see her there, More beautiful than beauteous flow'rs?—there—there! MANSO. I see the beams of the departing Sun Gleam faintly o'er the chamber—nothing more. [Tasso continues to gaze stedfastly at the window, without regarding Manso's last words, and, after a pause, appears to converse with an invisible being.] TASSO. Kind Spirit! thou art gracious thus to bless My sight with thy bright presence, and uplift My soul from all that's earthly, unto things Eternal as thyself. Oh! I could live On the enchantment which thy lips give forth, As those who dwelt on Ganges' verdant banks Fed on the perfume which the wild flowers breath'd On all around them—and were satisfied. “Ejunto donde nasce o largo braco Gangetico, o rumor antigo conta, Que os visinhos da terra moradores, Do cheiro se mantém das finas flores.” Camoens. Lus. Co. 7th. St. 19. When thou art near, my veins no longer feel To have their usual current; in its stead, Music seems floating thro' them, and converts Each thought to inspiration. MANSO Thou dost rave, Speaking to air, as if— TASSO. (continuing to address the imaginary spirit) And is it really thus?— That Ocean's bed is but a hidden realm Which fairies sport in, and that mirthful revels Prevail beneath the water, whilst its face Is one wide scene of terror? Sleep they so— In shells—gay, painted shells; whilst dolphins watch Their placid slumbers?—True! 'tis said, that once, As a young Fairy and his bride repos'd Upon the pearl-deck'd bottom of the sea, From out the sand a small, still current rose And bore them to the shore:—they waken'd then, To look upon a new and unknown world, (More beauteous than their own) which seem'd so fair That they did dwell therein, and soon each grove, Deep cave and valley felt their bosoms prest By tiny feet at midnight, and the Earth Vied with old Ocean in its fairy realms! MANSO. Oh, Poesy! thou art a dangerous gift; Making the soul of thy possessor sad With dreams—sweet dreams, which, whensoe'er they vanish, (As oft they will) leave discontent behind, And make what's real hardly to be borne. TASSO. Nay, nay—sweet Spirit! they are all divine. Painting is Poetry struck mute, and dash'd Upon the ready canvass, to delight The eyes of men. The ear doth Music fill With strains of wondrous melody, and makes Our bosoms seem etherial. Both of these Take birth from Poesy, which is the source Of each high feeling;—bids deep passion rise, Or lulls it into tears; decks all around With its rare magic;—from each little flower It catches eloquence; each blasted tree Gives it a moral lesson to hold out, And the wide Ocean and the mighty Sky Display a volume to its searching eyes, Fraught with a multitude of scenes and sounds That speak sublimity—whether the Moon Walk thro' the grandeur of a clouded Heaven, As might a fair girl in a wilderness; Whether she roll unclouded, with the stars Companions of her journey; or the Sun Burn in his glory there; or skies and seas Be calm, or ruffled by the Tempests' breath. Yes, Spirit! Painting, Poetry, and sound Of Music's various notes are all divine! MANSO. 'Tis madness this; but madness wonderful, And more to be admir'd than scoff'd withal: I will e'en tarry 'till the vision end. TASSO. (with a burst of admiration) It must, indeed, be grand—too grand for thought! Oh, Heaven! the finest things of Earth, the Skies, The depths of Ocean, when to thee compar'd, Are far more insignificant than sparks, Given from a taper, seen beneath the Sun: And Earth's inhabitants as mean to thine As flies unto the birds that love to mount And gaze undazzled on the Orb of Day. The Spirits of the Blest that enter there Must feel that even their eternity Can ne'er bring all thy glories to their view, Nor shew them all thy wonders—Spirit! say If it be thus:—it is!—o'erspread with meteors, Boundless, e'erlasting—Earth! thou art a shade— [In an altered tone. The Ghosts of those departed—do they rise To gaze upon their tombs; walk o'er the world; Revisit scenes endear'd to them thro' life, And watch the living whom they cherish still? Or sleep their spirits with the mould'ring clay Which once encompass'd them, till they be call'd To other mansions than the cold, dark grave, Nor deign to look upon Earth's face again? Thou knowst not? thou—an Angel! and not know These secrets of our being?—sure thou do'st, But art forbidden to disclose them here: 'Tis well—and I presume upon thy love.— Nay, tarry yet awhile, and let me still Look on thy matchless beauty—Wilt thou go? Give me thy blessing, Spirit!—She is gone! [Tasso here pauses, and continues with his eyes fixed on the window: then turns suddenly towards Manso, who stands in an attitude of astonishment. Bisaccio! now, thou canst no longer doubt Of my celestial visitant—What say'st thou? MANSO. That thou art mad, or that thy friend is blind: But thy strange parley with this thing of nought Was framed so quaintly, that it sounded well, And set me dreaming, too. No more of this— I'll wait on your next vision. Walk we forth! [Exeunt. THE NUPTIALS OF JUNO. A DESCRIPTIVE POEM. It is, of course, unnecessary for me to apologize for any deviations I may have made, in the following Poem, from the records of the Heathen Mythology; as Poets and Versifiers, so often allowed to garble truth, have an undoubted right to vary falsehood in the manner that may best suit them. Of all the isles that stud th' Ægean deep, And o'er its lovely breast new beauty throw, E'en as bright jewels, which aye sparkling keep, Add fresh enchantment to a maiden's brow;— Of all the isles that with old Neptune sleep, And round them feel his many waters flow, Thou art the proudest, Samos! for thy skies First saw the glory of Olympia's eyes! Thy breezes rise, with health on every wing, To greet the freshness of fair hills and dales, For ever fruitful;—the rejoicing Spring On thy green earth her gentlest breath exhales, Till Summer from her panting bosom fling Fresh sun-beams o'er thy mountains and thy vales; Whilst thro' each verdant mead, in tranquil pride, Pours the glad Imbrasus his grateful tide. The glad Imbrasus;—o'er whose glittering wave A willow its declining honors hung, To which the winds endearing kisses gave And from the stream awhile its branches flung:— As, lover's lips, which long encounter'd have And fondly to each other's ruby clung, Soft words, suggested by the o'erfraught heart Unto the ready tongue, will sweetly part. Within the willow's ever-moving shade Was plac'd the cradle of old Saturn's child, Rock'd by the Seasons:—there the green Spring staid To bless the Infant with its tendance mild; Summer, all languid, at her feet too laid, And Autumn, crown'd with fruits, in homage smil'd; Stern Winter tarried from his Northern clime, And deck'd her brow with majesty sublime! 'Twas in that joyous period of the year When Cupid sits on every verdant spray, And points his arrows at young maidens near, Nor leaves them unmolested on their way;— When earth is green and skies are passing clear, That Juno by her native willow lay,— Blessing, with her sweet weight, the hallow'd ground, And giving loveliness to all around. The Heavens were bright and the rejoicing Sun In their deep azure shook his golden hair, His wonted course as yet but half-way run: Etherial Dian view'd the dazzling glare The God threw downward, and seem'd fain to shun Its splendor dread; as if opprest with care, To think the glory which made earth more bright Should veil the beauty of her silver light. Free from his beams Olympia lay reclin'd, Her dark locks bound with Spring's divinest flowers, Whose colors all were tastefully combin'd And chosen from Flora's unfrequented bowers: Bare was her bosom, upon which the wind Was passing merrily the sun-shine hours; And, in thick folds, a white and silken vest Flow'd from her lovely waist—and hid the rest. Her thoughts were of the glory of the skies And all the Gods that in their beauty reign; When, suddenly, dark clouds were seen to rise From the wide waters of the Ægean main; The face of Heaven they hid from Juno's eyes, And Phœbus struggled with their host in vain: The air grew dull—loud thunder roll'd on high, And lightning flam'd athwart the dreary sky. Olympia watch'd the rising storm with fear, And look'd upon the clouds, as if she thought To see some God's almighty form career Thro' the fierce tempest which himself had wrought In fearful pastime—yet did none appear; Tho' all the air with deepest gloom was fraught, And wild-fire ran along the dark'ning space, Like horrid joy upon a madman's face. Strange voices murmur'd from the Heavens aloud; Strange sounds burst forth in answer from the sea, Whose billows, that so late of rest were proud And striv'd which of their host should gentlest be, Now seem'd to envy every soaring cloud And met the fierce winds with tumultuous glee: The winds with corresponding ardor come, And lave their wild wings in the Ocean's foam. “A God! a God!” ten thousand tongues give out; “A God! a God!” ten thousand tongues reply; Naiads and Dryads hear the echoing shout, And turn expectant to the frowning sky: Imbrasus from his urn looks up in doubt, And hears the willow o'er his waters sigh Thro' all its leaves; then seeks his oozy bed, And hides once more his crown-encircled head. The willow still Olympia lay beneath, And gaz'd around in wonder at the scene; When, by the cruel storm half pierc'd to death, A little cuckoo trail'd along the green; It paus'd at Juno's feet devoid of breath, And she uplifted it with piteous mien; Its drooping pinions to her bosom drew, And strove to waken it to life, anew. Its ruffled plumes she smooth'd, with anxious hand, And soon to life restor'd the feeble bird, Which all her kindness seem'd to understand And sounds of pleasure from glad bill preferr'd: Then, whilst the Goddess, with caresses bland, Answer'd its notes by many a gentle word, The Cuckoo hark'd to her harmonious tongue, And ever as she spoke still closer clung. It shook its downy plumage with delight, Nor longer reck'd the fury of the storm; For what could think of terror, or of flight, Whilst pillow'd on a couch so fair and warm? It grew—it chang'd; and now, in radiance bright, Stands Jove, reveal'd in his eternal form, Before the wondering Juno's doubtful gaze, And all the grandeur of a God displays. He looks as when, in Heaven, he sits supreme Among the Deities that worship round; His matchless glories their exhaustless theme, Whilst all the rolling spheres repeat the sound! But in his peaceful hand no lightnings beam, Link'd with dark thunder; nor strong sceptre, bound By dreary cypress;—for in hours of love Such things become not e'en Feretrian Jove. His brow was circled by an olive-crown Of everlasting green, and to his feet A mantle's rich, purpureal hues flow'd down, Embroider'd with unnumber'd flow'rets sweet; Whilst stars immaculate between them shone, And made the raiment for a Godhead mete: Far else than now appear'd his form divine Unto the Mother of the Heavenly Nine! He came in glory, and around him flam'd Diaphanous splendor and resistless fire: Then burst the Jubilee thro' heav'n and earth, And Nature to renew'd existence bounded In all her works, which felt a second birth And with fresh beauty were anon surrounded: Rang the far welkin with th' unwonted mirth Which from each corner of the wide earth sounded; Whilst God and Goddess mounted from the green, The glorious rulers of the jocund scene!— Her lamp the glow-worm trimm'd beneath the beam Of the hot sun; but not her mate to greet, Whom, from his airy course, its welcome gleam Is wont to summon to her still retreat: The birds sing blithely over grove and stream, And glowing pinions in mid' ether meet; Whilst Philomel, awaking hours too soon, Forgets her sorrows and speaks joy at noon. The pilgrim bee career'd from flow'r to flow'r, Whose sweets now yielded a repast more rare Than yet they e'er had done in loveliest hour: The butterfly with bright wings starr'd the air, And, gayly mounting from its native bow'r, E'en to the lark's wild height essay'd to bear: The fish play'd ever in each crystal cell Wherein the gambol-loving Naiads dwell. All things that breath'd on earth, or in the deep, And the gay people of the airy space, At once high jubilee were seen to keep: Each Nymph, each Satyr show'd a mirthful face, And merry Fauns, with cunning laughter, peep Forth from the shade of every sylvan place, Once more to gaze on Juno's well-known eyes Ere they be giv'n to the rejoicing skies. High in the air Feretrian Jove appears, Olympia hanging on his breast the while— Shedding for earthly loves a few kind tears, Which fell, like gems, upon her native isle: His new-found bride the mighty Thund'rer cheers, And soothes her spirit, till a heavenly smile Sheds o'er her features all its beauty rare— Then brighter grow the skies, more bland the air! On—on they go: proud Phœbus in his course Stays to do homage to the Lord of Heaven; Each River-God springs upward from his source, And kneels to Him by whom his realms were given: The hoary Neptune's billows, loud and hoarse, By their rude Monarch high in air are driven, Amid rejoicing music, and the woods Join in the wild devotion of the floods. A light burst forth from ether, and a car, Made glorious by the jewels that besprent Its golden wheels, shot onwards like a star At midnight on aërial message sent; Gleaming like light'ning, it career'd afar And second sun-light to the glad earth lent:— Seem'd it another orb had sprung to sight, Grand as the rest and flush'd with new-born light! Two graceful peacocks with the chariot flew, Richly caparison'd in seemly state, Their plumage bright as was the load they drew: With their own beauty seem'd the birds elate (As if the grandeur of their forms they knew) And paus'd, impatiently and proud, to wait The slow approach of Heaven's eternal King, And flapt the air with wide-extended wing. Soon their steep course the stately birds resume, Wafting the Pair Immortal to the sky, And higher toss the head and spread the plume As onward, in more measur'd pace, they fly, By Juno guided with bright reins, where bloom Flowers of all hues, that change—but never die: To Heaven's blue arch their glittering way they take, And gorgeous entrance at its portals make. Meanwhile, in Samos, reverend flamens build An altar, sacred to Olympia's name: Tall oaks, on which so late sweet songsters trill'd Their merry lays, now deck the holy frame, And golden censers, with rich incense fill'd, O'er the vast pile emit a perfum'd flame; Whilst little hands o'er all are scattering flowers, Belov'd by Juno in her infant hours. No bloody offering on the shrine is shown; Nor guiltless lamb depriv'd of cherish'd life; But fruits and herbage of the earth are strown Upon the altar's top, with beauty rife: The flames break forth, by gentle breezes blown And fann'd with their light pinions into strife; Till, quickly rising, they to Heaven ascend, And with their force the winds no more contend. Round the high altar little children steal, In wonder gazing on the offering's glare; And lovely women by their side reveal Charms that divide the ardent worship there: Before the rising fire the flamens kneel, Whilst, in the midst, with hand outstretch'd in air, By words one reverend man his thought betrays, And speaks, with solemn voice, this lay of praise: “The grass on Ida's top is green, And tall oaks seek the marble sky; Whilst sweet flowers grow each trunk between, And shedding all their perfumes—die: On Creta's isle the mountain stands, As monarch of her fertile lands! “O'er all the Cyclades it towers, And sees bright billows lave the beach; Whilst upward to the heavenly bowers Its verdant summit seems to reach; And, fill'd with youths and maidens gay, Crete's hundred cities round it lay. “In Ida's mount, a cavorn, cleft By Nature's hand, looks dim and dark; And deeply spreads, to right and left, Further than mortal eye may mark, Affording, in its secret cells, Fit place to work forbidden spells. “And many a Sybil there will sit, To mutter forth unholy charm, Or, mad with the prophetic fit, The future of its veil disarm, And, in wild words and mystic verse, Of Fate the records dark rehearse. “Amalthea sat in Ida's cave, Her pale cheek on her white arm leaning; Her eyes a darken'd lustre gave, Replete with a mysterious meaning— And round her flow'd a zoneless shroud, Black as the dismal thunder-cloud! “Down to the earth her tresses stole, More dark than jetty raven's wing; And round her head a wreath, like coal, Was plac'd to check their wandering— A coal-like wreath; but diamonds slept Beneath the shade that o'er them crept. “Thro' flowing locks her hands were straying; Her eyes were fixed upon the ground— (Vision of hidden things betraying) Then wildly gaz'd on all around: This wondrous lay the Sybil weaves— And gives to air the written leaves: Here the Reader may possibly be in a slight degree remin ded of the well-known lines in the Third Book of the Æneid: “Huc ubi delatus,” &amp;c. “‘Strike the cymbals loud and long, Priests of Cybele! in the gale; Let their music, join'd with song, Above the young God's cries prevail:— Louder and still louder strike— Make the tumult thunder-like! “‘With milk of the goat and with balm of the bee, I fed the young God on my Sybil's soft knee; And the young God laugh'd, As the juice he quaff'd, And laugh'd and drank right merrily! “‘Old Saturn is bound in a dungeon drear, Where day-light yet never hath shone; No accent—no sound can the Titan hear: For Silence sits there on her throne! Despair and a chain Are all that remain Of the kingdom so lately his own. “‘Lo! lo! the wild thunder His prison asunder Hath burst—and he rises again To the star-cover'd seats of his glory;— The young God hath rent the vile chain That bound down the Deity hoary! “‘I madden! I madden! By Tiber's river Old Saturn wanders on for ever; His kingdom lost—his glory gone, Not his the earth he treads upon:— Jove sits on high, And rules the sky In majesty alone! “‘I madden! I madden! and Heaven's blue cope Hath all its glitt'ring portals ope; And a bird-drawn car Is wafting afar, Slowly slowly, envelop'd in light, With the God of the Thunder, unbearably bright: By the Deity's side A Goddess doth ride, And the portals of Heaven close over their flight!’ “The Sybil paus'd: then up she rose, Pluck'd from her hair the coal-like wreath, (Less black than were th' unearthly brows That arch'd her bright dark orbs beneath) Her tresses round in wildness flung, And thns again prophetic sung:— “‘Fair Infant of Samos! to thee it is given To be Queen of the Earth—to be Mistress of Heaven; The souls of the mighty, the hearts of the proud Down—down to the dust at thy footstool have bow'd; The Monarchs of Earth and the Gods of the sky Shall shake at a glance of thy far-beaming eye, And maidens, to quench burning passion's wild flame, Will kneel ere they slumber, and worship thy name! “‘See! see!—her hand The fiery brand Whirls far along the trembling air; From pole to pole The thunders roll, And all her mighty power declare! “‘Mother of Hebe! Mother of Mars! Ruler of Earth! and Queen of the Stars! Thy temples shall spread o'er the isles of the sea, And Dido's proud city bend lowly to thee; The Heroes of Greece and the conquerors of Rome To thy altars, in lowly devotion, shall come; With their banners of triumph for ever unfurl'd, And the swords in their hands which have vanquish'd the world!’ “The song was sung—and to her cell, Far in the darkness of the cave, The Sybil went to dream of Hell And all the horrors of the grave: Foul fiends watch'd o'er her troubled slumber, And gave her visions without number. “Olympia, hail! The Sybil's truth Shall be reveal'd in aftertime, When thou, in thine immortal youth, Shalt bloom in Heaven's eternal clime, And there among the Gods reside, Almighty Jove's unrivall'd Bride! “Great Juno, hail!—and gracious smile Upon the sacrifice we pay; And ever bless thy native isle— The island where thy childhood lay: Hail, Queen of Heaven, of Earth and Air! And listen to thy flamen's prayer.” The flamen ceased.—And now, from all the skies, Is heard a sound as of ten thousand lyres; And songs from heavenly tongues in concert rise, Telling of gentle loves and fond desires: The music rises now—now softly dies, And now again the list'ning soul inspires, Alternate varying in its burst and fall, And the charm'd senses holding at its call. Then slowly, slowly the blue skies recede, And from their bosoms fling a glorious flood Of light, of golden light, which doth exceed All human thought, and glitters as imbued With colors from their rainbow-prison freed, Bright with eternal beauty—many hued; And new-born radiance, as of countless suns, Thro' all the Universe increasing runs! The Heavens are open'd, and the mingled speech Of their immortal dwellers, sounding sweet In melody divine, men's ears doth reach, Enchanting them with music: glittering feet, Thick as clear pebbles on the wave-wash'd beach, Now sparkling part and now in splendor meet; And far as mortal vision can behold Extends one wide and glowing sea of gold! There Jove in radiance sat—and at his nod All things with renovated beauty blush'd; And, trembling in the presence of their God, Into mute adoration men were hush'd, And view'd upon the verdure which they trod Arise unnumber'd flowers, from whence there gush'd An overpowering fragrance, and the light Of all their various hues shone starry-bright. Beside him Juno rested on her throne, Crown'd with a ray-emitting diadem;— Ceaseless the many-color'd glory shone, As if a spirit in each lustrous gem Were smiling ever with delight alone: A golden circle did the jewels hem, And each appear'd as Cynthia, when around Her glowing orb the halo's ring is bound. Her hand a sceptre fill'd, on which was plac'd A Cuckoo, sweet memento of her love! And stately peacocks at her side were grac'd By many a heavenly smile, which aye could move Their plumage into air; and then they pac'd Around her proudly, and officious strove To show her all their beauty—then, again, Down at her feet reclin'd, with motion vain. Fair flowers by lovely hands were round her spread, 'Mong which the poppy's hues conspicuous laid; The lily by their side its odors shed, Nor snow-like garb its little leaves display'd; For dies more splendid now adorn'd its head, And in deep purple it appear'd array'd;— In after times it took a rayless vest, And owed its whiteness unto Juno's breast. Behind her Iris in her beauty came, Divinely smiling thro' celestial tears; Partly dark clouds surround her airy frame, And deck'd with sunshine half her form appears: With graceful arm, the smiling, weeping dame A mass of blended colors gayly rears, And flings it high:—then, quickly, o'er the skies The Rainbow glitters with its mingled dies. The mighty Neptune left his wave-girt home, In grandeur rising from the boundless Ocean, And upward glided to the aërial dome, Drawn by two winged steeds, whose rapid motion Outstript his billows when they highest foam; Their stately heads they toss'd in proud devotion, And champ'd the golden bit and shook the thong Which curb'd their fury as they swept along. The Heavens received him, and the steeds return'd, With the deserted chariot, to the sea; Disdainfully the wondering air they spurn'd, And wafted on their course with haughty glee: The coursers now along the waters burn'd, Which lav'd their panting sides tumultuously;— Swiftly they cut the billows, in their strength, And sank beneath them to their home at length. From Enna's weeping fount, by bards oft sung, (Nam'd from the Nymph who dar'd his power resist— The beautiful Cyane—) Pluto sprung, Surrounded by a dim and fire-fraught mist: Beside him sat Persephone, still young, And beauteous as when first her red lip kist Her lov'd Sicanian flowers, whilst round they threw Perfumes, made sweeter by Aurora's dew. Four sullen steeds along the trembling air Drew the mute Monarch of the Realms of Woe, In a sulphureous car, whose fearful glare Did sudden terror on the earth bestow: Unto the Heavens their gloomy Lord they bare; Then quickly sought the gloomy shades below, Whilst the fierce King assum'd his skiey throne And sat in dark magnificence alone. His bride past onward to the glorious band Of heavenly Powers that round Olympia mov'd: There Phœbus and Diana, hand in hand, Admir'd by every eye, exulting rov'd,— (He mindless of lost Daphne's beauty bland, And she forgetful that Endymion lov'd—) And all the Gods that fill'd the etherial space Paid deep devotion to Olympia's face. Hush'd were the waters—and, receding, show'd The Paphian Goddess mounting thro' the wave, In a transparent shell, whose beauty glow'd With the rare lustre that bright sea-gems gave, Making the waters glitter, as they flow'd In music by them;—and young Naiads clave The bosom of the Deep, or, on the rocks, Stood blitbely playing with their weltering locks. “Doridaque et natas: quarum pars nare videntur, Pars in mole sedens virides siccare capillos.” Ovid. Met. 2. v. 11. Thro' the glad Nymphs Dione onward swept And smil'd on all their gambols as she past; Whilst sounds of melody around them crept, From Ocean-lyres upon the waters cast: Huge Dolphins from their slumber swiftly leapt And circled the bright Queen, who glided fast Within her wave-born car, and gaily bore, Glowing with beauty, to the Cyprian shore. Thither the wide shell floated, 'mid the rays Of its own brilliance with the sun-beams mix'd, (Bright as a meteor which at midnight strays The cloudy skies and wondering earth betwixt) Filling all eyes that view'd it with amaze— And where it left the sight they still were fix'd, As loath to deem it vanish'd: on it flash'd, Brightening the waters as they round it dash'd. The car hath paus'd upon the Cyprian coast, And she, the Queen of Pleasure, treads the earth, Fair as when first, upon the billows tost, She rose exulting in her wondrous birth: Her forehead white a wreath of myrtle crost, And roses shaded her blue eyes of mirth; Round her fine form the charmed zone was plac'd, And robes, by Nereids wov'n, the Goddess grac'd. Back to its distant cave the bright shell went, The dolphins still disporting at its side, Proud of the splendor which its beauty lent To them, the dwellers of the Ocean wide: The air with foam their splashing tails besprent; Their thick scales glitter'd thro' th' illumin'd tide; Till the sea-chariot sank, as if to sleep, And left them dark'ning in their native Deep. It sank: and from afar came Cupid, thron'd In rosy state, unarm'd and laughing loud: Unto the Cyprian chariot doves were bound, And meekly cut the air; whilst sparrows, proud Of that they circled, flutter'd round and round, And swans, snow-white, before the young God bow'd, Small wreaths of myrtle bearing in their bill, And sorrowing, as they went, for Phaeton still. On his fond bosom Psyche's beauty lay, Light as a rainless cloud upon the skies;— Psyche the insect-wing'd, for ever gay And holding a blue Heaven within her eyes; Hallow'd by loveliness, o'er which Decay, With its time-telling hues, was ne'er to rise; But there she sat within the Boy-God's arms— Her love immortal as her matchless charms! One moment paus'd they on the Cyprian strand; Then cut the air again as swift as thought, Dione bearing from the moisten'd sand, Who blest her offspring and his kisses sought: Onward careering, by gay Zephyrs fann'd And girt with odors from Arabia brought, They on each other smil'd, and frequent spoke Sweet words that sham'd the silence which they broke. The yielding bosom of the winds they cleav'd, In grandeur moving to their mansions blue; Till Heaven the ever-cooing doves receiv'd, Which seem'd all conscious of the charms they drew: The Nymphs of Ocean, of their Queen bereav'd, Gaz'd on her beauty as thro' air she flew; Whilst her approach the glad Gods mark'd with joy, And much they Psyche prais'd, and more the Boy. Cupid rov'd sporting thro' the glitt'ring scene, And o'er him Psyche wafted, as he went; Whilst Venus glided all the Gods between, And at Olympia's feet, half-smiling, bent: Then, passing on, with slow and graceful mien, At every step fresh beauties round her blent; Till to her radiant throne the Queen drew nigh, And sat the peerless dweller of the sky! Then went the mandate forth—and all that dwelt On earth, or in the Ocean, rush'd abroad, Fill'd with devotion's fires, and Nature felt, In the great presence of Immortals, awed: Man and his sister woman humbly knelt Th' eternal glories of the Gods to laud, And universal songs of praise gave forth, From the wide Indus to the frozen North. The dwellers of the waves, that long had bided In coral caverns, 'mid the ceaseless noise Of moaning billows, or by rocks resided, No music hearing but the Syren's voice, Now boldly on the water's surface glided, And shouted to the kindling air—‘Rejoice!’ Their dwelling at the word the Syrens left, And sang to every billow which they cleft. The fish leapt up;—then sought the wave again, And round the Ocean-weeds unceasing danc'd; The brindled lion left his forest-den, And harmless with the gentle lamb advanc'd; Sent forth the birds their praises from the glen, Whilst merry fawns along the greensward pranc'd, Crazy with joy, and saw the purblind mole At noontide looking from his winding hole. One stream of merriment tumultuous ran Throughout the Universe, and sounds of praise Unto Olympia's majesty began From every lip to burst in thrilling lays; And all things breathing round their ruler, man, Stood joyous, turning to the Heavens their gaze; And the Immortals, as their skies unfurl'd, Saw spread before them one rejoicing world! Why frowns Olympia? All the Gods that dwell In the wide Heavens pay homage to her power, And mortals, bending low, her glories tell And bless the Goddess in her nuptial hour;— Throughout the world rejoicing praises swell, And life immortal is her glorious dower;— But yet she frowns upon her Heaven-girt throne, And from his station calls the Pleiad's Son. The swift God hears the summons in the sphere Where, by his Mother's side, he reigns retir'd: Soon on his feet the glitt'ring wings appear, Which seem at once with inspiration fir'd And wave unceasing; then, his rod of fear, With magic by Latona's Son inspir'd, He grasps exultingly, and o'er his head The sacred cap, by Jove bestow'd, is spread. He hastens from his orb, and quickly stands Before the throne of Heaven's relentless Queen: Unseen by all he takes her high commands, And glides, invisible, the Gods between; Soon passes thro' their thick and radiant bands, And leaves behind him all the eternal sheen: The light air knows no burthen as he flies, Nor feels the earth the Herald of the Skies! Where is Chelone? Earth's most beauteous maid! Why comes she not rejoicing with the rest? Why, when the Gods have all their host display'd, No sounds to Heaven have her sweet lips address'd? Why hath she only from its glories staid? Of mortal girls the loveliest and the best! Why, when devotion spreads the wide world thro', Should she alone withhold her praises due? Young, beautiful Chelone!—never yet Did flowers shed perfume on a form more fair; And never hues so soft in violets met (When their fresh bosoms kiss the vernal air, And languish, with the showers of April wet,) As those which her blue eyes for ever bear, Full of enchantment as the skies above And speaking to all hearts of bliss and love! She lov'd not solitude—her gentle heart Was proud to be a captive, and to feel Divided pleasure; she had not the art To cherish thoughts of passion—nor reveal; From what she doted on to seem apart, And the deep secrets of her breast conceal:— Her lips told not her feelings, but her eye Was far more eloquent than word, or sigh. She needed, ivy-like, some friendly bough Whereon to hang her beauty and her joy; Some kindred spirit to repeat her vow, And render back her love without alloy: Alas! that passion should no rest allow, And the deep feelings of the soul destroy! Her love was her destruction, and the truth Of her young heart brought woe in early youth. She sits in Tempe's leaf-encircled vale, Where Peneus, sorrowing for his child, is flowing;— Thin clouds his waters in their course exhale, And on the neighb'ring groves light foam are throwing: Enipeus and Amphrysus seek the dale, Each stately tree within their bosoms showing; And other streams along the valley wind, Sad comfort whisp'ring to the Parent's mind. The varying colors which her cheek bedeck Have beauty that no gem of earth can show; And wreaths of pearls, upon her spotless neck Glitter, like hoar-frost o'er a world of snow, When the moon shines and many a starry speck From its blue home sends forth a feeble glow: Her eyes are rais'd, but far apart from Heaven Rove the fond feelings thro' her bosom driven! She thinks upon her lover, and the thought Regardless makes her of all else beside; The music, the rejoicing seem as nought— Full loudly now they swell, and now have died, And yet she hears not, for her soul is fraught With passionate sensations, and the tide Of overwhelming love shuts out the sound Of the wild jubilee that floats around. Her red lips part: and first, a single word Glides o'er their ruby, gentle as the breeze Which, in the summer months, at eve is heard To sport in dalliance with the grateful trees; Then more she speaks—e'en so a tuneful bird With first a note and then a song doth please: Her voice at length flows on, and, with her head Leant on her hand, these love-taught words are said: “Oh, that the heart should tremble at a kiss! E'en as the strings of some melodious lute, Beneath the hand that strikes;—that such wild bliss Should linger in a gaze! Tho' tongues be mute And in the eloquence of speech remiss, Still eyes speak thrilling language, and forth shoot Fire to the doting heart, and make it quake With thoughts of passion, that have power to break! “Joy—joy to sit, by moonlight, on the hills, Twin'd in a lover's fond, endearing arms! The white Diana with her beauty fills All air—all space, and, as by magic, charms The elements to silence; o'er the rills Breathes silver, and the depths of Ocean calms Into wide rest,—e'en as a mother's singing Lulls the lov'd infant to her bosom clinging. “Then rise the feelings that make life a dream, And turn all speech into a single sigh: The stars have beauty, and the moon's pale gleam, Can glad the bosom and delight the eye; Till love obscures their glory, when they seem, But as fair things to light it:—the reply Of beating heart to heart—of soul to soul, Shuts up the senses and demands the whole! “Oh, Love! young Deity of boundless might, Trampling o'er youthful hearts, and giving life To musings that exist but in the light Of thy far-beaming torch—divine and rife With unimaginable sweetness; thoughts which write Their records in the breast, and with the strife Of passionate enjoyment pure hearts fill, Which, but for thee, might have been tranquil still! “'Tis strange!—for even the tumultuous sense Of joy which passion to the young heart yields Is mingled with sad fears; but why, or whence They rise we know not, o'er the bliss that gilds The hours when love is reigning, and dispense Clouds to his sunshine: e'en as, o'er the fields, Light mists will spring upon the glowing green, When nought but radiance in the skies is seen. “'Tis said to be unwise to build a nest Of many hopes upon another's truth; Nor deem that ought may mar its blissful rest, Or harsh unkindness blast the days of youth. It may be, Love!—and that thy visions blest, Of gay-wing'd joy and undecaying ruth, Are but as beauteous clouds of airy lightness, Which prove but vapor cloth'd in fleeting brightness: “Yet will I still love on!”—Chelone's tongue Here ceas'd its music, and her long trance broke: Then, all at once, she heard the sounds which rung Around and Echo from her slumber woke: Amaz'd, affrighted, on her feet she sprung And call'd her lover—but no lover spoke, For he had staid to worship with the crowd That, far from Tempe's vale, to Juno bow'd. She stood and shudder'd; and her bosom beat, As if forewarning of a grief to come; Scarce can she trust unto her trembling feet To move in safety towards her neighb'ring home: She slowly turns; when, lo! Cyllenius fleet Stands in the path to work her fearful doom, Waves his charm'd wand—and sad Chelone roves A silent tortoise thro' her native groves. 'Twas done—and Juno smil'd: the Nuptials then Of the eternal Deities were sped: Bright eyes look'd star-lit; words which mortal pen May never venture to transcribe were said; And sacred vows, beyond terrestrial ken, Were spoken by rare lips, and tears were shed From heavenly eyes, which, in their falling, show'd 'Twas in delight, not grief, their crystal flow'd. Thro' all the world appear'd no sign of sadness, But those look'd joyous who ne'er smil'd before; Young, merry hearts assum'd unwonted gladness, And painted Nature lovelier colors bore; The mirth of the Immortals grew to madness: The shouts of Sea-Gods drown'd the Ocean's roar, And Heaven and Earth, with one sublime accord, Sang Juno, Bride of their eternal Lord! They sang. Now finish'd are the sacred rites, And from the glorious altar they descend— Jove and his bright Imbrasia—to the heights Of vast Olympus, whose proud top doth blend Its grandeur with the stars, and in their lights Bathes its wide brow in triumph; there they wend Their way, 'mid glories that no eye could count, And hail the splendid summit of the mount. Rare lyres are sounding—and the heavenly Powers, By slow degrees, desert th' aërial domes:— Singly they go; as, when the rosy hours Tell the dark waters that Apollo comes, The bright stars fade before the rising showers Of his insufferable beams, and quit their homes Slowly, reluctantly and one by one, Abash'd and sorrowing that the Night be gone:— So the great Gods disperse thro' all the skies, With native brightness glitt'ring on their way: Grim Pluto to his dreary kingdom hies, And steed drawn Neptune seeks the Ocean-spray; Slowly away the golden radiance dies; And all the splendors of the Heavens decay: No longer now the thrilling music flows, And o'er the world th' etherial portals close. To rest the dwellers of the Earth remove: Man seeks his home to muse on heav'nly things; Each bird sleeps silent in its leafy grove, And every beast to cave and forest springs The fish all slumber in the cells they love, And not a Nereid on the Ocean sings; Far in the Waters Titan veils his light, And darkens o'er the world the star-presiding Night. THE SKELETONS. My Fancy wander'd in the Caves of Death, 'Mid heaps of mould'ring bones, and heard and view'd The words I echo and the scenes I sing. Around me Skeletons stood lank and foul: Their looks were horrible; for one and all Seem'd gifted with existence—a pale light Shone in their eyeless sockets, and their jaws Mov'd as in mockery of living lips. I past before them, when they grinn'd amain, And hollow laughter shook the dreary vault! 'Twas terrible to see—and seeing, think In space how brief should I as they become, And be a partner in their devilish joy.— I thought it devilish—not so their speech, Which spoke in sorrowful and human tones, And this the tenor of their eloquence. ‘The fears of Genius, in extreme despair Of doing ought to make his name immortal, Tho' sad and desolate, have bliss, compar'd With the o'erwhelming and grief-laden clouds That wait on Passion when her sun is set. Each youthful Fancy, in its rising pride, Creates an idol, before which it bows As to reality; but soon dull Time Proves the bright image to be false as dear, And seldom is it that in after-life We meet the Spirit of our early dreams. My fate was otherwise: the very form Which lit my slumbers, and my waking thoughts Fill'd with its visionary loveliness, Before me came in actual being—fair As her imaginary counterpart: The fetterless hair—the eye, half blue, half grey, Shone both as in my musings, and the lips Whose coolness I had prest in fancied bliss, Existed—beautiful as ever gave Sweet sounds in answer to the minstrel-string— Sweet words respondent to the voice of love! Her figure was of those that seem as made For adoration, and of such a form Was her mind worthy:—she admir'd the swell Of Ocean's thunder and the Thunder's roar; She lov'd the wildest elements—her eye Watch'd the strong eagle in his reckless flight Whither no other bird had dar'd to mount; Her ear would listen to the lion's growl, And therein find a music—and her thoughts Ran thro' the maze of all sublimity! Yet in her converse she was gentle ever, And 'mid surrounding vice did keep as pure As snows do even in a torrid clime, Where the hot sun moves all things, save themselves. But Purity itself in Passion dies: We met, we lov'd—how wildly, deeply, words Can shew, no better than an orrery The stately motion of the living fires That roll in air: but, oh! between the hour When first of beauty all my visions were, And that wherein appear'd young Beauty's self, Communion I had held with sinful men, And learn'd to laugh at virtue—marriage rites I thought an idle mummery, to which Disgust was near akin—a stranger, love. When woman gives her heart away, her mind A prisoner too becomes;—and thus it was With her who deem'd me guileless as herself; She drank the poison of my tongue—and fell! Yes—the sole flash that lit my cheerless sky Did I extinguish in an hour of guilt; I stole the honey, but I burnt the bee; I broke the cypress-head—the cypress died.— Oh! not a villain on the guilty earth With him can vie in damn'd hypocrisy, Who plays deception with a woman's heart, And blights the bosom that was wholly his.’ ‘Regard not outward show—it falsifies:— The lightest finger steals the heaviest purse; More saintly nothing than a villain's speech. Plain is the plumage of melodious birds— Gaudy, of those which sing not; the loud drone Preserves no honey in its noisy flight, But how industrious is the silent bee! Trust not the man who hath a specious smile For ever on his face, and on his tongue Most pliant words—the world's a world of rogues, And few are honest who do honest seem. Of all things doubt—give ample faith to none, And thine own senses credit least of all.’ ‘I was the Parent of as fair a Child As ever gamboll'd o'er the the meads of Spring. Unceasing mirth and fine intelligence Were her peculiar attributes—tho' young; For fifteen Autumns had not yet opprest The earth with moistureless and faded leaves Since she was born: her deep blue eye Just spoke of rising passion, and her ear Now lov'd impassion'd melody, the which Her small lips warbled forth in strains divine: In the light dance did she the lightest move, And the most exquisite in form and step. Dead was her mother—she my only child; The spring of all my pleasures, all my love; The only object that I priz'd on earth— My earthly jewel, that had hues of heaven! She died—my sweet girl died: her eloquence Grew silent, and her beauty pale and dim; The azure brilliance of her eye declin'd, And Death exulted o'er her dying frame. In the cold earth she was by moonlight laid, When all was voiceless as her whit'ning lip, Save the loud pealing of the funeral bell That pour'd monotonous music into air. My bliss was buried in my offspring's grave;— I liv'd in utter solitude and woe, Far from all revelry; for sounds of joy Fell on the stillness of my broken heart As fall the sun-beams on a plague-struck City, Which doubly desolate and fearful make The desolation which their splendor lights!’ ‘There is a pride in singularity, A foolish pride—most paltry pride of all; For ne'er was excellence, or merit prov'd By strange behaviour and unsocial ways;— They shew an emptiness in heart and head, And wise men should avoid this buffoon art, Which suits mean Folly in his simplest mood. Of form and dress let idle Idiots boast: Chance gives the first—the last will riches bring. Not so the clothing of th' immortal mind, Which thought and constant study yield alone. In mental beauty there is cause for pride: The Mind—the glorious Mind hath nought to do With form, with feature, or with modes of dress; Its riches are as hidden as divine— Boundless its powers, which can prevail o'er all The disadvantages of corporal shape, And lift a Pigmy o'er a Giant's head!’ In strange and desultory fashion thus Spoke each stern Skeleton—and I mov'd on; Till, suddenly, another in my path Stood tall and fearful, and these words pronounc'd: ‘Hark unto tidings of the airless grave! My body lay as dead within the earth:— It mov'd not, felt not; neither saw, nor heard; But still I had a consciousness of life, Commingled with a dim idea of death: I knew that I was utterly alone— Apart from all things living, save the worm, Whose bravest palace is the well-stor'd tomb. And I had many dreams—such dreams as come O'er brains molested by a calenture: Now seem'd I on a vessel's busy deck, 'Mid waves of fire; until a hurricane Arose and bore the lofty masts away, As they were feeble osiers; then the ship Sank in the flaming billows, and a shriek Spoke tales of torture—but I felt no pain. Again I dream'd: and thought me on the top Of a sky-touching tree, from which I fell— And falling, snatch'd at every neighb'ring branch, In hope to cling thereto; but each in turn Broke in my grasp—and down, and down I went, With varied motion, till the dream decay'd. And next came more than visionary grief; For life appear'd returning to my frame: My eyelids open'd, but I could not see; I felt the gnawing of the hungry worms, And heard them creeping round me, but to move And crush their myriads was beyond my power: Then burning thirst assail'd me—but I knew That no blest liquids sparkled in the grave, And the dire knowledge parch'd my lips the more: I tried to speak—but could not, and my pangs Grew to intolerable agony, When, in a moment, all the wide earth shook, And here I wander'd, as thou see'st me now.’ Such the wild language of the Skeleton; And as he ceas'd, unnumber'd ghastly shapes Came quickly round me, as intent to speak Of other mysteries; when, over all Past sudden terror, and a form appear'd, Less visible than viewless: it was mute, But with the silence that destruction follows— Not the calm stillness of security: There liv'd a grandeur in its wondrous shape, But not one ray of beauty, and it seem'd In part a Deity, in part a fiend. It wav'd a shadowy arm—the Skeletons Danc'd at the motion, gave a hideous shout, And thus discordantly and loudly sang: ‘Who can Death's dominion tell? Who the deeds of Death rehearse? His mighty work all ages swell— His temple is the Universe! Most prevalent art thou, oh! Death; Youth, beauty, age are all thine own: Thou mov'st—the moth is robb'd of breath; Thou com'st—and vacant is a throne! ‘Wide the Earth; but not a spot Exists thereon where thou art not: Deep the never-slumb'ring sea; Its depths are all replete with thee: High roll the merry stars in air; But thou art in thy glory there: Gods reign sublime beyond the sky— And art not thou a Deity? ‘Triumph, Death! The skies may lose The beauty of their splendid hues; The earth, with all its varied dress, May crumble into nothingness; The stars may fall; be quench'd the sun— But never shall thy reign be done!’ Thus sang the vocal spectres, in loud praise Of the dark form above them, and look'd glad. Wav'd high the shadowy arm again—and soon The Cavern echoed with all sounds of woe: Death laugh'd and faded; but the Skeletons Resum'd their terrors, and stood silent each.— Louder than thunder, then a tumult rose; The black earth open'd, and the bony throng Dash'd headlong downward thro' the deep abyss, And wildly cried—“We suffer, oh! we suffer.” Such was my vision—if, indeed, I dreamt: But the strange scene, the laugh, the voices, song So real all appear'd, that, even now, I cannot think it was a dream alone. THE SPIRITS OF THE OCEAN: A POEM. CANTO I. The song—the song!—it was warbled by lips Sweet as whatever the honey-bee sips— And where? By the Sea—by the Sea—for no region can be So fit for a Spirit divine, as the Sea— Play-ground of the winds, the limitless place Where they love the white foam of the billows to chase— 'Twas there. But the song—the song!—by a Spirit 'twas sung, And these the wild notes o'er the waters that rung: “Far distant strains of music sounded Along the weltering Sea; Old Ocean from his slumber bounded, Swept forth the winds in glee: The tempest-spirits shouted loud And call'd their dull clouds from the deep;— The clouds appear'd and threw their shroud Across the moon, with dark'ning sweep. The stars look'd mad, and shrunk behind The black veil of the cloudy sky; The thunder mingled with the wind, And the wild lightning laugh'd on high: And a vast meteor cleft the air, Swiftly hurrying on its way, Displaying by its sullen glare The darkness it could not allay: And music beautiful was flowing Around the meteor, as it sped, Until it paus'd and hover'd, glowing, Bright o'er a rock's majestic head. “Sing to the winds! Its light was shining Over an infant Child asleep; Nor could the winds and waves, combining, Break on its placid slumbers deep. Calm was its rest as the tears which lie In eyes by young love lighted; Still as the joy sweet sounds supply To hearts by sorrow blighted; Mute as the leaves of April gay Lie, when the winds in caves repose; As air, when o'er the sunny Day The waves of Ocean gently close: It slept upon its rugged pillow, Among the sea-beat rocks, And dampness, rising from the billow, Bedew'd its auburn locks. “Sing to the winds! That Infant slept, More calm than other calm things are; Nor heard the winds that round it swept, Nor the fierce thunder's voice afar: But louder still than winds e'er blew Was heard a voice of sadness; O'er the wide Ocean Spirits flew, And lash'd the waves to madness:— Both long and loud the voice of woe, And deep the silence that ensued;— The winds awhile forgot to blow, Awhile the billows were subdued: But soon they re-assum'd their wrath, And that sad voice broke forth again, And thro' the Ocean's watery path Pass'd a white steed with flowing mane. And on his back the Courser bore A Master of immortal race;— A Spirit of the Sea, who wore Eternal sorrow on his face. “Sing to the winds! The snorting steed Dash'd thro' the waves with fiery speed;— And where he came they roll'd aside, As if he ruled their raging tide: He neigh'd in answer to their roar; He shook his mane—they foam'd the more. And proudly now the steed drew on To where the burning meteor shone; The rock was gain'd, submissive grown, The Steed his graceful neck bent down, His mane upon the billows spread And let them idly lave his head. The Master spoke a magic word— By ministers unseen 'twas heard, And airy forms of Sprites, that dwell On rocks and plains invisible, Throng'd o'er the Infant, without number, To watch him waking from his slumber: He woke—and stretch'd his little hands Unto those gay, fantastic bands, Who gently rais'd him in their arms, Delighted with his infant charms, And, with songs of sweetest mirth, Slowly bore him from the earth; The spreading meteor o'er the whole In semblance of a halo stole, As if the Moon, in darkness hid, In kind concern had deign'd to bid The wondrous ring which oft around Her pathway in the skies is found To circle that melodious throng And light them in their course along. “Sing to the winds! The meteor's ray And the gay Sprites have pass'd away; The Steed dash'd onward as before, And still his gloomy Master bore, Beneath whose eye and on whose breast The Infant was again at rest, Unheeding in its tranquil sleep Of the loud tumult of the Deep. “As the weapon of the quiver, When flying from the bow; As a light bark down a river, Whose waters briskly flow; As a bird that seeks the dwelling Where its little ones repose; As a torrent, quickly swelling, Foaming down a mountain goes:— So swiftly dash'd the milk-white Steed Thro' the wide waters in his speed, Until he reached the distant wave From whence he first had risen, Then a loud snort the Courser gave And sought his former prison— Down—down he sank—the waters wild Clos'd o'er the Spirit, Steed and Child. “And oft the Dwellers of Ocean sung To that sweet Boy,— And he would listen and lend his tongue To words of joy. In sparkling caves, Beneath the waves, They laid him among the gems of the Sea— And saw him smile And look the while More lovely than ever a gem could be. “Sing to the winds! That Infant now Hath manhood written on his brow; And darker tints o'erspread his hair; His eyes are dark—his forehead fair;— And he hath gather'd from his Sire A Spirit's might, a Spirit's fire, And knowledge of all things that live Beyond what mortal lips can give: He reads the language which the skies Display before unearthly eyes, And all the mysteries that dwell On Earth, or in the Ocean's cell. Sing to the winds! the Spirit's Child Is, as his Father, skill'd and wild.” Such was the song.—But whose the tongue From which the varied music sprung? The voice was a Spirit's—but not of the sky; Nor of grotto, nor vale where merry ouphes lie: She dwelt not on mountain, she dwelt not in wood, Nor in murmuring rill, nor in river's bright flood:— Oh! where to that Spirit of beauty was given A dwelling, if neither on Earth, nor in Heaven? She dwelt in the glittering caves of the Deep, And oft on the foam of the billows would sleep,— And the billows she slept on appear'd, as they roll'd, Like the clouds of the air, when all border'd with gold— She dwelt in the Ocean—a Spirit as bright As ever yet smil'd in the regions of light. Scarce had the Spirit clos'd her song, When from the waters rose a sound, And words mysterious flow'd along The billows as they wander'd round:— And, at the words, a rush of wings, Loud as the voice of countless springs On pebbles playing, Past o'er the Sea, and heavenly sighs, With tears, cast down from unseen eyes, Thro' air were straying. Then a faint splash spread far and wide O'er all the bosom of the tide;— Like that we hear by rural pool. Whene'er across its waters cool Glad birds their way are winging; Now all disporting in a ring, Now dipping in the pool their wing, And now again upspringing. Ye marvel, perchance, why so swiftly flew Such numberless wings at the words that were said? Oh! well the sad Spirits of Ocean knew 'Twas lowly to worship a young Maiden dead:— And all that had stray'd From their watery dwelling— On mountain-tops laid, Or the black clouds compelling; On the winds mounted high, In forest shade sleeping; Or on tall trees that sigh Their wakeful couch keeping,— Their revels destroy'd and their sweet slumber broken,— All swiftly return'd as those wild words were spoken. And deeply, deeply down the Sea They hurried onward mournfully:— They past o'er cities which the wave Had folded in its boundless grave, And look'd on many a lonely hall That once rang loud with festival, And chambers, now in ruins sunk, Where Beauty smil'd and Love grew drunk: They saw the sea-horse in his lair, Nor broke upon his slumbers there; They past the Monster of the Water, Whilst resting from his work of slaughter; Leviathans they mark'd reposing; They saw the eyes of dolphins closing, And view'd each lesser tribe that dwells In Ocean, sleeping in its cells;— From its fierce lords a moment free— Those Tyrants of the billow'd Sea. A palace stands bright On the wide waters' bed, Enveloped in light From ten thousand gems shed: Its roof is of pearl, With rare diamonds bestrown, And coral-wreaths curl Round its pillars of stone, More precious than yet Ever shone 'neath the eyes Of Beauty, and set With the ruby's bright dies: Each cornice and frieze Is with silver bedight; Its architraves please With their porphyry bright: Of gold is its base, And its portals display More charms than the face Of the sunniest day;— For on them are trac'd Forms, of wild love that tell, In bright purple, rais'd From the murex' small shell; In red tints that come From the Insects of Ind, Whose dwelling and tomb Is the thick web they wind; “The Gum-Lucca (used in dyeing red) is produced by a very minute insect, which fixes itself on the juicy ends of the branches of particular trees, and is glued to the spot where it settles by a clear thick liquid which exudes from its body, the gradual accumulation of which forms it a complete cell, which becomes its tomb and the birth-place of its young.” Vide Robertson's India. In yellow and blue, Intermingled with green, And ev'ry bright hue 'Neath the vast billows seen. Here slumbers in a dreamful sleep A Goddess of some fountain deep; Whilst o'er her gleams a mortal eye, Enchanted with her symmetry! Above, a Giant-form appears, His furrow'd cheek bedew'd with tears;— And in his eye a mighty grief Sits, as disdainful of relief. A young girl, as the lily pale That whitens in the midnight gale The glorious moon beneath, Hangs on his breast and strives to calm His spirit by that nameless charm Which, breath'd from woman's eye and voice, Might make the dying heart rejoice And worship even in death! Far to the right are sylphs, adorning Their hair with golden flowers,— Fresh as the blossoms of the Morning, When dew-drops greet the hours: And children are disporting round A lake, where white swans live, And seem as listening to the sound Its sparkling waters give. These, and the charms of mountain, lea, Of valley, wave and lawn, Deck those bright portals of the sea, In radiant colors drawn:— A Spirit's cunning each display'd— A Spirit's hand their beauty made. Hark! a melancholy song Thro' the water flows along, Warbled by Sprites that stand before The Ocean-palace' glittering door:— The notes are wild and sad the strain, And this the music of the main: “Maiden! Maiden!—thou wast fair As is the light That revels bright Within the stars, when all alone They commune on Night's ebon throne, Nor sun, nor moon is there. “Maiden! Maiden!—when the Moon Rolls full and high Along the sky, A blue flame round her orb doth cling; But thy young eyes outshone that ring, And faded, ah! as soon. “Maiden! Maiden!—flutes by night, When heard afar Beneath each star, Sound soft and sweet and beautiful;— But thy young voice could sooner lull, And was as gayly light. “Maiden! Maiden!—thy young face Once wore the dress Of loveliness; But youth, nor beauty decks thee now, For cold is thine unrivall'd brow And faded all thy grace. “Maiden! Maiden!—Spirits kneel In grief to thee, Beneath the Sea; And as the waters o'er them swell, Their radiant tears in silence tell The thousand woes they feel.” Such were the mournful words that flow'd From lips divinely rare, As round the dome those Spirits stood, And watch'd its portals fair; Which, as the plaintive song was sung, Apart were slowly, gently swung; And, as they oped, their hinges threw Strange music on the waters blue, Which join'd its altering notes to those That from the throng of Spirits rose:— One sound would speak of hope betray'd, The next of beauty's bloom decay'd; And then a note would rise that told Of passion wreck'd and love grown cold, And as it floated on the tide Each mournful Spirit deeply sigh'd: Anon, the music in its strain Told of despair's undying pain, Of youth and glory doom'd to die, And heave the wild and bitter sigh Of Hope's expiring agony: Then chang'd the notes that told of madness To those more gentle and less wild, Warbling of sorrow's speechless sadness, Of feelings desolate, yet mild;— But tho' the music varied ever In each melodious flow, It told of joy's bland tumults never— Its sounds were all of woe:— Tho' loud they rise, tho' gently fall, A note of sadness runs thro' all. Widely apart the portals spread, Whose hinges now no longer shed Their music on the murmuring Sea, As wild as music e'er may be;— But all was stillness, and a light, Dim as the hues that herald night, (Those tints crepuscular, obscure Which to mute thought the gazer lure) Within, without its shade o'ercast, And o'er the Ocean's bosom past,— And all was stirless as the flowers Of Flora's most sequestered bowers. Wide ope the portals—Who, with brow Betokening an undying woe, Sits there in silence and in gloom, Aye musing on his changeless doom? 'Tis he—the Rider of the Steed, The ruler of his fiery speed: He sits upon a lofty seat, With countless gems beneath his feet; Within his eye and o'er his face As dark a sorrow still hath place As when he past along the Deep To wake the Infant from its sleep, And bore the smiling babe away Far, far beneath the Ocean-spray. —And who is he that near him stands, Attendant on his mute commands, With eyes that hold as wild a glow As lightning on the sky can throw,— With glossy hair, and lips, whose form Tell that their owner's soul is warm?— 'Tis he—the Child, who late was borne Along the mighty Ocean's track, From summit of tall rock forlorn, Upon the milk-white Courser's back;— Now waxed to that tumultuous age, When Passion opes her burning page, Bids reckless Youth its words admire And catch a portion of their fire. As oft upon a Winter's-night The heavens are black—the stars are bright,— Tho' dark his eye and dark the hues That o'er his face their shade transfuse, Within, within there lurks a spirit Which oft doth mirthful mood inherit, Stealing across each wilder throb Of passion, that hath power to rob The bosom of its joyous dress, And turn it to a wilderness. But who is the Maiden that sits in the hall Of that Palace of Ocean, the palest of all? Without motion, or life, and appearing alone Some statue cut out from a half-livid stone? Without or a smile, or a beauty to cheer? Whence came she? await, and ye quickly shall hear, On an emerald throne, drest in glittering state And by splendor surrounded, that dead Maiden sate: Her pale brow was adorn'd with a crown of pure gold, Where the ruby and topaz were seen to unfold Their beautiful glories, whose radiance might vie With the colors of earth—the rich tints of the sky, When the Lord of the Daylight is hiding his car In the breast of the waters wild, flowing afar: A necklace of amber, as bright as was ever By the Heliads shed over stream of a river, Glow'd on her shrunk bosom and rendered its chill, Fix'd paleness sepulchral more death-seeming still, As flowers that are dying more desolate seem When fresh verdure round them in beauty doth gleam. A robe of light azure encircled each limb, Which made her dull eyes look more ghastly and dim; And rings of rare price from her withering finger Seem'd falling, as if all unwilling to linger Where tints of young blood to their brightness could add No beauty, and where e'en their splendor look'd sad: But still o'er her eyes and her face and her neck Of loveliness rare might be traced the pale wreck, And the hair that escap'd from her glittering crown, And far as the gem-cover'd pavement flow'd down, Still kept its rich colors, all glossy and bright, O'ersprinkled with ringlets, divine to the sight:— It seem'd as if Death from his whole prey forbore To make the half-ruin his horrors shew more; Or else, ere the work of destruction was done, The Tyrant bewail'd at the ruin begun;— Then suddenly ceas'd the fair form to devour, And left it a mark of his pity and power! The word was spoken—to the ground Each Spirit that stood weeping round Bent sorrowful and slow: Again arose that music wild, And lowly down the Master's Child Inclin'd his lofty brow; Whilst the sad Parent, speechless, gaz'd On eyes that could no more be rais'd;— And as he looked, a long-drawn sigh Betray'd his bosom's agony,— To think the faded form he view'd Was once with loveliness endued, Whose coral lip and azure eye Could make the rudest gazer sigh;— To think that she, who, when the moon Made night more beautiful than noon, So lov'd to mark its radiance fair And watch her rival of the air, Whilst ever flow'd the notes along Of Fancy's wildly-warbled song, To think that lov'd and loveliest maid, So oft upon his bosom laid, Who seem'd commission'd from the skies To bear to Earth a Paradise,— Like rainbows should have past away,— As beautiful, but frail as they! Oh, Woman! mortal as thou art, Supreme thy triumph o'er the heart! Thine eye and cheek and magic lip (Where bees might well their honey sip) Make man forget his soul was given To worship a far different Heaven:— Nor Man alone—for we are told, In Chronicles of days of old And many a Bard's romantic story, That Gods have left their seats of glory And scoff'd at Heaven's immortal rest, To languish on a Maiden's breast:— And wisely scoff'd—for earth, nor sky Hath charms that may with woman's vie, When beauty brightens o'er her form And youth makes all her feelings warm! Return, my Muse!—The Spirits knelt, But worshipp'd not with praise, or pray'r; Sad sighs and tears told all they felt, And silence—near akin to care:— And all look'd sorrowful—save one— 'Twas he-the Master's only Son: Tho' long and low he stoop'd beneath The crown which deck'd a brow of death, There was a laughter in his eye, Wild as the stars thro' heaven that fly, Showing strange thoughts, and plainly telling With love, with love his heart was swelling;— And, whilst he humbly bent the knee To that pale Maiden of the Sea, A smile upon his kindling cheek, (For smiles can eloquently speak) Told that, altho' his form inclin'd In worship there, his chainless mind Had taken to her wings divine, And bow'd before a lovelier shrine. Then rose a Spirit, at a bound, From off the pearl-besprinkled ground, (Pearls that made the earth appear Beauteous as a mirror clear!) And, with her tresses, swept away The tears that on her eyelids lay; With voice harmonious silence broke, And these the gentle words she spoke: “Spirits of Ocean's boundless Realm! Whose glories the blue waves o'erwhelm;— Sisters of the murmuring Deep! Where ye, do your revels keep, Let my words anew destroy Thoughts of pleasure, dreams of joy; Nor haste to gambol o'er the waves, But mourn within your Ocean-caves!— And do not smile, oh! Offspring young, From sire immortal proudly sprung; But let my tale thy sorrows move, And learn that it is grief to love:— Tho' bright the Sun—his fierce beam kills, And love is death, howe'er it thrills! “The thistle's down now decks the plain, And now upon the winds is riding; Now to the earth 'tis dash'd again, And now again thro' air is gliding:— And thus, by turns, I fall and rise,— Now touch the earth, and now the skies; This moment—and the air's my dwelling, With all the winds around me swelling; Another—and I'm downward driven Swifter than ever light from heaven:— And over land and over sea I oft do hurry joyfull, To gaze on all that beauteous is And smile on Lovers as they kiss; And I have watch'd o'er forms as bright As stars that sleep on lap of Night, With eyes to charm, with lips to bless, And radiant with loveliness; But never saw I one so fair As she who sits a ruin there;— Tho' thousands were divine and tall, Young Zora look'd the Queen of all! “And the Spirit supreme—the proud Lord of the Ocean Bent down to that Maiden in lowly devotion,— As the green laurel bows to the bright Sun for ever, And tires of its undying worshipping never. Full oft when the young Morn came smiling in light, And earth and the air were all beauteous and bright; When glad birds exulting rose high on the wing To welcome the coming delicious of Spring, Whose meekly-eyed flowers were around seen to rise And breathe all their sweets to the unclouded skies; When the Sun hurried forth and array'd in his beams Each hill and each vale, with their murmuring streams; Kiss'd Ocean's calm billows, as gayly they roll'd, And turn'd, as enamour'd, their white foam to gold; When the amorous winds were careering in air, And robbing the flowers of their fragrancy rare, And glad Nature, smiling, o'er Heav'n and o'er Earth Threw her garment of beauty, her sounds of sweet mirth;— I have seen the proud Spirit that young Maiden greet, And defraud her red lips of long kisses most sweet. “And oft they wander'd, side by side, On Earth and 'neath the waters wide; And the great Spirit's Courser bore His lov'd one, thro' the billow's roar, Unto the Ocean-palace, gleaming With mimic stars for ever beaming; And where she now looks cold and pale,— A ruin for perpetual wail— I've seen her smile in garments proud, And paid her homage warm and loud:— Then to the earth the Steed again Would bear her fearless o'er the main;— (For the wild waves ne'er dar'd to harm The form that could their Ruler charm) And as she press'd his snow-like back, And gently grasp'd his bridle slack, Beauteous she look'd as Dian's car, When thron'd on stainless clouds afar. “Weep, Spirits! weep.—Ah, me! that death Should rob the fairest form of breath! That all must sicken, all must die That lingers in mortality! The happy birds, with all their songs, Must fall and sing no more; The glittering waters sportive throngs Must moulder on the shore; The rural things of grove and field Their beauty to decay must yield, And the gay dress of hill and vale Must wither in the wintry gale:— For all must sicken, all must die That lingers in mortality! And even she, upon whose breast A glorious Spirit lov'd to rest, Expir'd in all her matchless bloom, And cloth'd a Spirit's soul in gloom. Her charms decay'd not one by one, Till youth and beauty all were done; No wrinkle ever cleft her cheek, Nor tints of grey were seen to streak The brightness of her glossy hair: In youth, in bloom the Maiden died, And the last breath her sweet lips sigh'd Was breath'd from form as ever fair. “Oh! weep, Spirits, weep—'Twas the burial night Of that beauty of earth, and no stars lent their light To the dome of the sky; but a mantle was there Right fit to o'ershadow a scene of despair: It seem'd that the Heav'ns had been robb'd of their mirth By the woe that o'erclouded a portion of earth, And that all the bright stars from their thrones had been taken,— The blue field of their wand'rings destroyed and forsaken,— That they might not profane, by their revelry glad, A midnight so solemn, a moment so sad, When the pale wreck of beauty was brought to the grave,— Of beauty belov'd by the Lord of the Wave. 'Twas the burial night:—and the silence around Was broken alone by a sorrowful sound: That sound was the wailing of those who pursued The path that led on to the burial grove; That wailing arose from the mourners who view'd The corse of that Maiden of beauty and love. “And a reverend form, with hoary beard, The first of the sorrowful throng appear'd; And behind him there follow'd a matron old, The pangs of whose bosom may never be told— (Nor mortal, nor spirit can ever reveal The woes that a Mother made childless doth feel.) And then came on four Ethiops tall, With gloomy eye and forehead stern; One slowly bore the burial pall, Another held the burial urn: And two, on swarthy shoulders, bore Dead Zora to her funeral pile; Slowly they follow'd those before, Nor spoke one mournful word the while. The bier of the Maiden with white was spread,— A cushion of white lay under her head;— And fair flowers around her were scatter'd and dying, As if sad and unwilling to bloom Whilst they on the death-bier of Beauty were lying And perfuming the way to her tomb. Behind the bier four maidens came;— Each maiden bore a torch's flame, Which all around its red beams threw And gave the mournful throng to view. And lastly came a beauteous crowd Of children, that were weeping loud;— Their laps were fill'd with herb and flower, Which round their little fingers cast; And ceaseless fell the fragrant shower, As slowly on the funeral past. “'Twas the burial night. The mourners stood Around a pile of leafless wood: The Ethiops twain Had gently lain The Maiden on its summit high; And he the pall of death that bore With careful hand had spread it o'er Her pallid cheek and rayless eye: A grave, as deep As ever sleep Eternal of still death requires, Display'd its cavern dark and wide Beneath the pile, and by its side The urn of gold Was plac'd, to hold The ashes of the funeral fires. “The deep grave is ope—the bright urn is there; Around the tall pile the red torches glare:— A moment hath past—and the pile is on fire, And swiftly the wild flames mount higher and higher; They triumph, they rage, as they soar to their prey, And the sparks they give forth make the darkness look gay.— I hover'd above, and I hark'd to their sound, And I sigh'd as they revell'd the dead Maiden round;— Burning on, burning fiercely, disdaining control,— For I thought on despair, when it withers the soul! “Hark!—a voice sublime and strange Assails each unexpecting ear; Its words are wild—but soon they change To those that it is grief to hear: The flamen signs him with a sign, Which he devoutly deems divine; The children's rosy cheeks turn white; The maidens tremble with affright; The Ethiops four their dark eyes raise, And wond'ring on each other gaze, Whilst e'en the matron stays her grief To ponder on those accents brief:— All marvel whence those sounds could flow That broke the dreary silence so. “By the light that shone In his fiery eye; By the mournful tone Of his frequent sigh; By the gloom of his brow, As I saw him in air; By the fetterless flow Of his dark-waving hair; By a word and a name From his pale lips that came;— I knew, I knew that the Spirit sublime Had swiftly come, in his own good time, From Ocean's realms and from Ocean's spray To bear his lifeless young bride away.— “Away—away.—The pile burnt on, But she for whom 'twas rais'd was gone; The Spirit had resum'd his own, And ta'en her to his Ocean-throne. Away-away:—but, as he went, A signal thro' the air was sent: I left the mourners far behind, And rode upon the angry wind— Which, in its music, seem'd to tell It lov'd a starless midnight well;— And all the spirits that reside And sport upon its pinions wide Held converse with me on my path, And whisper'd of the tempest's wrath Which then was arming in the west, To rob the air and sea of rest; To fill the heavens with wild emotion, And rouse the madness of the Ocean. I left the Spirits to their mirth, And lightly stept upon the earth;— I hurried on, and swiftly trod O'er flowery path and verdant sod, And came at length to where repos'd The Child of Mortal and Immortal; With eager hand I soon unclos'd The stately mansion's graceful portal, And guardian pinions gently kept Above the Infant as it slept. “And, oh! 'twas excellent to view The slumbers of that blooming boy: A smile that o'er his features grew Betoken'd a pure dream of joy; His little hand he rais'd on high, As if some painted flow'r were nigh That charm'd his infant sight, The which he fondly sought to gain, To tear its rosy leaves in twain And spoil its beauty bright. And those who gaz'd upon his face Might fain have deem'd some sprite of air Had left her own, her native place And turn'd her into childhood fair, To prove how passing sweet the gleams Of Fancy in an Infant's dreams. “The hour was come:—with gentle hand, I blithely rais'd the Infant bland; Thro' the wide air delighted sped, And laid it on a tall rock's head— Then hied away. The Ocean's roar Hath mingled with my song before.” The song was sung—And who was she That warbled so melodiously? My favorite Spirit—she who sung Of strains across the waves that rung; Of Courser proud, and how the Child Was borne across the waters wild;— Then sought the Deep. The Ocean's roar Had mingled with her song before. The song was sung: the Sprite again To worship with the rest return'd:— Rose the great Master's offspring then, And all his face with fancy burn'd: His cheeks were flush'd, his eyes were fill'd With light that love alone can give; His beating heart with feelings thrill'd That only rise where love doth live: He smil'd on all, and with a voice That made each beauteous breast rejoice— That every Sprite of woe beguil'd, Thus Reumon spoke—the Spirit's Child: “'Twas motion all. The restless Deep Roll'd onward, as it ne'er could sleep;— Each billow, with a rushing sound, Hied towards the blue horizon round, As if it deem'd 'twas some sweet home Wherein it might forget to roam, And there in blissful quiet lie Upon the bosom of the sky. The winds had left their tranquil slumbers, And hurried forth in all their numbers, Making the peaceful air unstill And gliding o'er the earth at will;— They stirr'd the grass of every plain, Now sunk awhile—then rose again; Above, around their influence cast And mov'd the green leaves as they past, And humble grove and forest proud Right lowly in their presence bow'd. Bright streams rejoic'd, and many a fountain Was sparkling down from every mountain; And beauteous lake and stately river Were rippling onward, as for ever. The Sun was striding on his way, Surrounded by a mantle gay Of gaudy clouds, that rose and died Alternate by his radiant side: The Moon at distance mov'd along, Paler than ever, and the throng Of hidden stars were dancing thro' The bright, etherial fields of blue,— All anxious for the sun-set hour, When they regain their native pow'r, And strive to make the reign of Night As the proud Day's divine and bright: And living things upon the earth Were gambolling in their wildest mirth; And birds were sporting in the air And warbling all their music there: Across the rivers, o'er the Sea Light skiffs were gliding merrily, And ships, with every sail unfurl'd, Pursued their way from world to world. 'Twas motion all:—the earth and Heaven Seemed each to restless movemet given. “And I along the shore was roaming, To watch the boundless Ocean foaming; To view the bright beams of the Sun Exulting o'er the waters run, And look on all the beauteous strife, Of Nature, newly sprung to life Beneath the rosy Morning's eye, Wide opened in the eastern sky. I wander'd by a river's brink, Of beauty and of love to think; But little deem'd I soon should prove The power of beauty and of love, And little thought I soon should view Th' embodied charms my fancy drew:— But view I did; for o'er the stream, Careering in the solar beam, A light skiff flew, whose silken sail Right fondly held the passing gale, As in a prison far more sweet Than e'er retain'd its pinions fleet: The oars were golden and the wave Seem'd proud that things so fair should lave Their beauty in its sparkling tide, And glitter o'er its surface wide. “But whose the form, so rare and young, That o'er the painted vessel hung? Whose the red lip, and eye, that shone Bright as the stream it look'd upon? Oh! could each fine and thrilling word That e'er from Spirit's tongue was heard; Could all the noble thoughts that spring In minds of Poets as they sing;— All—all in one mellifluous sound Commingled be, by skill profound, It could not tell the matchless grace That sparkled on that maiden's face, As o'er the stream the vessel past, Driven onward by the playful blast. “Fair Spirits! by your smiles I tell That ye do guess the sequel well.— Not far the bark had cut its way Ere I ador'd that maiden gay, And gather'd from her lips and brow A passion that enchanteth now: At once a mutual flame was caught, The feelings into phrensy wrought, And love and rapture fill'd the hours In verdant groves and rosy bowers. “Fair Spirits! by your smiles I see That ye have guess'd my thoughts of glee;— And, truly, whilst ye sadly paid Deep homage to that lifeless maid, And wept, right sorrowful, to trace The paleness of her faded face, Where beauty once appear'd divine, Far merrier reveries were mine:— For I was musing on the hour When last with every beauteous flower I deck'd my Laura's ringlets bright —With violets blue and roses white;— And prest her lip, and watch'd her eye, And hearken'd to her gentle sigh;— And rapture, love, a world of bliss Were centred in one glowing kiss! Rare thoughts, gay Spirits!—tho' the wreck Of loveliness was nigh to check My roving fancy;—tho' the Chief Of the wild Waves was mute for grief, And matchless eyes were wet the while,— Despite of all, I could but smile: Sweet flowers will show that Spring is near, And smiles betray the thoughts that cheer.” He spoke: and away, on the bright wings of hope, Young Reumon hath passed from the dome of the Deep: The worship is done; the gay portals are ope, And forth from the palace the fair Spirits sweep;— With smiles and with tears, thcy all hasten along, And converse in the sweet notes of beautiful song; They hie to their revels on earth, or in air, And give to the light winds their minstrelsy rare. But where is the Child of the Spirit supreme? Where now doth his eye in its brilliancy beam? Oh! wherever 'tis glancing in brightness around; Wherever the tone of his deep voice may sound; Wherever his light feet in ecstasy rove;— 'Tis sure by the side of his own lady Love. But the Lord of the Deep? As the sorrowful willow, Whose branches bend over some rivulet's bank And love on its bright stream their verdure to pillow Till their furthermost leaves become wither'd and dank, Tho' the current should fail, tho' its freshness should die, And its smooth bed forsaken all desolate lie, Still reclines as before and as faithful as ever, As tho' the lost stream had deserted it never: The great Spirit thus o'er the dead Maiden hung As fondly as when her rare beauties were young:— Tho' the glow of her lip, tho' the bloom of her cheek And her eyes, whose blue light could a wild language speak, Were all faded and gone, still the sad Spirit lov'd, Nor e'er from the side of the dead Maiden mov'd. And still the fair Sprites of the far-foaming Sea Would frequent abandon their revels of glee, And 'mid sounds of strange music, right mournful, tho' sweet, Would weep as they knelt at the dead Maiden's feet. Enough of sighs, enough of tears:— Bring me my favorite lyre that cheers! Now vanish gloom and vanish sadness;— Ye plaintive sounds! away, away:— Give me the harp that speaks of gladness! I die for a more cheerful lay. But, as the light strings gayly move, Still let their music breathe of love;— Of love, sweet love and woman's eye And beauty's bloom melodiously.— Ye musings, hence! that mirth destroy; I strike the chords that wake to joy! CANTO II. Oh, Heaven! how beauteous is the glow Which Morning on thy front doth throw; When sky and earth and air and sea Breathe incense and divinity! But far more beautiful the tint Which Midnight on thy brow doth print; When moon and stars, divinely fair, Glitter in all their grandeur there, And Earth beneath thy face lies spread, Tranquil as thou art overhead! The moon roll'd on, in cloudless glory, Beneath a wilderness of blue, And all along the mountains hoary Flung a pale garb of silvery hue: One little twinkling star, alone, At distance in her pathway shone, And smiling worlds, sublime as high, Were scatter'd thro' the azure sky: And as the bright Queen swept above, (The image of continual love) She seem'd a splendid mirror, sent To charm the stars thro' which it went, By holding out its bosom fair For them to see their beauty there. Nature had all her music hush'd, Save the wide Ocean's ceaseless roar; Whose foaming billows eager rush'd To kiss the pebbles on its shore, And dash'd against each lofty rock, As tho' its adamant to mock. So calm, so beautiful, so bright, So full of sweetness was the night, One could have almost wish'd that morn Would ne'er again those skies adorn. Oh! countless were the things divine Which view'd the moon-beams round them shine; But loveliest was a girl that laid Within the brightness which they made In sleep, as stirless and profound As the o'erpow'ring silence round. Her dark locks she had careless flung O'er her fair arms unsullied white, And ringlets on her forehead hung, Nor hid its matchless beauty quite: Tho' clos'd her eyes, the very lid And the long lashes that conceal'd Told how divine the orbs they hid, The orbs themselves tho' not reveal'd;— And those who gaz'd upon them clos'd, Whilst the sweet Maid in bliss repos'd, Might swear the lovely lights below Were black as midnight's darkest brow, But fill'd with living fire, that turn'd All hearts to passion where it burn'd. And next her lip—but wherefore strive To sing the magic of her face? The Painter's fancy ne'er could give Such beauty to his forms of grace, And least of all may tuneful verse The story of her charms rehearse. And slept the Maid alone? Blush not, Beauty! thou wast born For not an hour of life forlorn— The heart's thine only throne! And there thou reignst o'er smiles and tears— Queen of a world of joys and fears, That all around thee cling and hover Till youth and love and all are over:— No plaintive tone—away—away:— A blessing on each Minstrel gay! The Maiden's head was pillow'd on The bosom of the Spirit's Son: They were alone—and Reumon kept His eyes on Laura, as she slept, And prais'd the gentle pow'r that blest His lov'd one with such peaceful rest. And then he look'd around, above, And commun'd with the stars on high:— All things on earth did speak of love, And all the air and all the sky:— He rais'd his voice, and every word By Spirits of the Deep was heard,— And forth they came, and one and all, Obedient to his powerful call; And some did tune harmonious lyres, As o'er the sleeping girl they hung, And, as they lightly pressed the wires, 'Twas thus their answering sisters sung: “There is light in the sky, There is balm in the air, And the still earth may vie With the beauty that's there;— And the Spirits of Ocean are roving afar, From the depths of the Sea to the furthermost star. Some have gone, on gay pinions, To climes of the East, In Arabia's dominions On perfume to feast; And some, sportive, are laid On ice-cover'd rocks, Where the Mermaidens braid Their emerald locks: Some are floating on Ocean; Some laugh in the light Of the Moon, whose proud motion Ennobles the night: Some move in the vale To the music they play, And then, on the gale, Hurry blithely away; Whilst we gayly watch over young Beauty's slumbers, And warble with joy in our sweetest of numbers. “Slumber, Maiden! Love is waking To behold his Beauty rest;— Blessing, kissing oft and breaking Roses on thy cheek imprest. “Slumber sweetly, Maiden young! Spirits fair have o'er thee sung Gayly, gayly,—and away Hasten with the waves to play:— Slumber, slumber all the night— Maiden dear! thy dreams are bright.” Thus sang the Spirits:—then advanc'd, With gentle pace, a sister band, Which round the sleeping Maiden danc'd, With foot to foot and hand in hand: Their garments in the moonlight gleam'd, And brighter than that moonlight seem'd, All radiant ever, and no shade By their etherial forms was made;— And difficult it were to trace The outline of their form and face;— And scarce could one that gaz'd declare Which the fine Spirits, which the air. They parted then, and each upheld A thread that seem'd of moon-beams wrought;— From the fair Moon's own breast impell'd And by those beauteous Spirits caught;— And then in mazy rounds they went, Whilst music sweet divinely sounded;— Now stood erect, to earth then bent, Then up again in concord bounded,— And still around their footsteps light Was drawn the thread of moon-beams bright.— Awhile they danc'd, awhile they sang, And music soft harmonious rang In sweet reply, and air and sea Seem'd hallow'd by their minstrelsy. “Away, gay Sprites! wild Reumon said: At once the warbling Spirits fled;— Their voice, their lyres were heard no more, And all was silent as before. The Maiden woke and vow'd that ne'er Did vision so divine appear; And gaily said that, as she slept, A host of Spirits o'er her swept, And sang beneath the virgin Moon Unto their lyres melodious tune; That others danc'd in beauteous guise, Then vanish'd from her stedfast eyes:— And Reumon smil'd—and fondly broke With joyful lip her gentle speech; Of love and pleasure wildly spoke, And the rare tales that Poet's teach:— And Laura listen'd to the voice Of him she worshipp'd, and the eye Of Bard did never so rejoice,— In watching each bright sphere on high And all the glories that take birth From Ocean, or the wondrous Earth,— As did that Maiden's, whilst she gaz'd On Reumon, as her charms he prais'd, Vowing that words of love were ne'er Breath'd into lovelier maiden's ear.— I said she worshipp'd—and her heart To his was bound by fetters strong; And words of his could e'er impart More charms to her, than syren's song, In days of old, to those whose oar Approach'd Sicania's dang'rous shore. 'Tis sung the Hamadryades Depended on their kindred trees; With them to life did slowly spring, Divine beyond imagining; Bloom'd as they flourish'd, and decay'd When their lov'd boughs in dust were laid:— And even thus the Maiden young On Reumon's love for being hung; And youth and bloom would soon have died Could aught have made that love subside. Away!—it was an hour sublime, When Joy shook hands with passing Time; And light and love fill'd all the scene O'er which the bright Moon roll'd the Queen. The Lovers drank of Passion's cup, And every feeling wild was up High in the breast—and soul and sense Were lost in bliss divine—intense! Their pulse mov'd quick, their hearts beat high In all Love's sweet variety;— Hours swift away as moments flew, And, one by one, the stars withdrew;— Yet still on softer couch than down Lay Reumon— But ye quaintly frown! Your stoic thoughts ye need not tell; For I do know their tenor well. Aye, frown, ye Grave!—let Wisdom's crowd Rail against Love's bright self aloud, And term him, o'er and o'er again, A wild chimera of the brain; Still will he reign, to charm the soul, And all must yield to his control;— And those who love are wiser far Than all pale Mammon's votaries are— For what were Earth, or Heaven above Without the thoughts—the fire of love? By Phœbus' lyre Megara's wall Was render'd passing musical,— And Love can bid a heart of stone Assume a wild, impassion'd tone; Each thought of gloom at once destroy, And make the soul all feeling—joy! Lo! again the Morning bright Shines in her celestial height, Smiling from eastern mountain's crest On night, retiring to the west:— Early sun-beams gleam around; Sparkling dew-drops kiss the ground;— And every branch of every tree Gives token of returning glee. The air grows warm, and now advance The insects in their mazy dance; The flowers assume a lovelier hue And all their odors bland renew; In deeper tints the skies are clad, Enlight'ning all the waters glad, And Earth and Heaven their charms display In honor of the rising Day. Still Reumon, by young Laura's side, Ador'd his dear, unrivall'd bride; Nor heeded time, nor light, nor space In gazing on her peerless face; But fondly linger'd near to mark The changes of its beauty—Hark! A trumpet's loud and deaf'ning clang, Tumultuous, in the distance rang. 'Twas War's first note, announcing grief to come, When tears should answer to the muffle-drum, And Love's pale cheek be pillow'd on the sod Where once her Warrior and her Hero trod, Till the stroke fell and it became a grave For hearts to bleed o'er and for tears to lave. The trumpet blew—and, soon, from land to land Past dauntless millions, arm'd with spear and brand; And helm and cuirass gleam'd o'er many a field From heads and bosoms that ne'er deign'd to yield:— And haughty steeds, that shar'd their riders' lust For blood and conquest, spurn'd the subject dust, And neigh'd exultingly, whilst gun and sword Did their base bidding at a Tyrant's word. All Earth was terror:—streams of sable gore Died the deep sands of each contested shore— Whole cities blaz'd, and Ruin, far and wide, Display'd the folly of Man's hell-sprung pride. The beauty of the world was soon destroy'd, And Nature's thrones became a blighted void;— Where verdure laugh'd, and fields of dark'ning gold, Beneath the pinions of the breezes, roll'd; Where flow'rs look'd forth upon the tearful morn, Drest in their colors bright and newly born; Where streamlets sweetly murmur'd in the sun And proudly seem'd 'mid scenes so fair to run; —All, all grew desolate; nor could the ground Supply with food the beasts that wander'd round; But all in hunger made their piteous moan, And the Earth satisfied the worm alone. Wild grief shed burning tears:—where late the sire Had seen his young hope, with an eye of fire, Demand the strife sublime, was now a tomb, O'er which the father mourn'd his offspring's doom. Old matrons were made childless; beauteous eyes Of girls upbraided the unpitying skies, Or wept in resignation, till the cheek Grew cold with thoughts that have no pow'r to speak. Strife rose and spread, till every hill and plain Groan'd with the loathsome weight of warriors slain, And Death swept onward in his shadowy car To feast triumphant at the heels of War! If such the Madness, such the Guilt, That gloried in the blood they spilt; If quiet thus the land forsook, And tumult held unbounded sway,— Oh! well might Love and Beauty look For happier climates far away, Where peace and joy again might greet The silence of their blest retreat, And the glad hours in pleasure go, Unruffled by one thought of woe. Vile weeds will hide the clearest stream, And dust obscure the greenest earth; And mist will dim the brightest beam That ever from the Moon had birth:— And scenes of terror aye dispel The dreams that round young Beauty dwell, And woe and death can ever blight The magic of Love's strange delight. A land of bliss, a home of quiet, Far from the world's unhallow'd riot; Where earth is green and skies are clear, And Nature's music greets the ear, Thrown out from waters and from grove, Is the sole spot that's fit for love. —And such a sweet and peaceful clime, (Replete with scenes and sounds sublime,) Was that to which wild Reumon bore The Maiden beautiful and young— By mortal eyes ne'er hail'd before, And never yet by Minstrel sung— A land of love, a land of glee, Right fit for Passion's ecstasy! On the sea-shore the Maiden stood And look'd upon the boundless flood, Which, far as her bright eyes could trace, Roll'd foaming, with majestic grace, Deep—deep, around, As if no bound Were near to stop its glorious pace. 'Twas now the hour that Reumon vow'd Should see his Love forsake the strand Where war and tumult rang aloud, To seek a fair and quiet land. That hour had past:—her cheek grew pale And strength and hope began to fail,— For Reumon came not, and afar The ceaseless din she heard of war, Which nearer and yet nearer drew, Until the warriors met her view— Cloth'd all in strongly-tempered steel, With plume to helm and spur to heel. They mark'd her well, and paus'd awhile, Delighted with a form so fair, And then began to fawn and smile And told her of her beauty rare: She trembled—and ne'er yet did bird Whose music in the air is heard, When close pursued by hungry hawk, So long for refuge safe and nigh, Wherein his ravenous ire to balk And right secure in covert lie,— As Laura for her Reumon brave To bear her o'er the bounding wave, Far from the warriors fiercely stern That round her murmur'd all in glee, As pleas'd the terror to discern Of Maid so passing fair as she,— And every moment nearer came To question of her home and name, Looking, as they around her rang'd And each with each fierce looks exchang'd, Like fiends, whose very touch can blight, Surrounding some fair form of light. They came,—and one, with iron clasp, Enclos'd her in his hated grasp: She rais'd her voice:—“Oh, Reumon mine! “If one kind thought of me be thine;— “If love, if vows have ought to bind— “Let thy rare Spirits mount the wind!”— Listen, listen—music gay Floats upon its airy way; Golden pinions gleam afar, Sparkling as with gem and star; Swiftly, swiftly, sound and song Come the charmed air along, And Spirits six Their voices mix, Flying, flying as they sing And a light bark with them bring, With golden sails And painted sides, To kiss the gales And greet the tides: Falling, they upon the billow Lay the bark, as 'twere a pillow Fit for thing so beautiful; Rosy garlands then they throw On the nimble vessels prow, And sweet flow'rs that fairies cull. The Spirits warbled—whilst they sung As from the earth young Reumon sprung, High in the air a weapon whirl'd, And to the dust the warriors hurl'd:— Then gently clasp'd his Laura dear, And bade her not to weep, or fear. They left the ground:—the Sprites decay'd Amid the music that they made, And, onward by the breezes sent, Away, away the light bark went. The wondering Chieftains uprose from the plain, And murmur'd of vengeance—the murmur was vain; Nor the Maid, nor the Child of the Spirit shall stand Again on those Warriors' desolate land:— With a frown on his brow, each retir'd to his home, To muse on new combat and glory to come. Meanwhile o'er the tranquil sea Past the light bark merrily:— It cut the water with a speed, Whose swiftness might all thought exceed; Nor even left a fleeting track Upon the billows' stately back, Which mov'd unruffled still and fast, As nought above their height had past.— The light bark flew, nor ought controll'd The tenor of its arrowy course,— Swift as a leaf, when onward roll'd By all the winds' tumultuous force;— Its painted prow right gayly shone;— Its sails upon the air were thrown;— And such a thing minute and gay It look'd upon its nimble way, That those who from afar beheld Its beauty o'er the billows glide,— By heavenly hands unseen impell'd, That mov'd around its glitt'ring side,— Might deem 'twas e'en the Nautilus Careering o'er the Ocean thus, All haste to greet the Halcyon's nest, Constructed on the water's breast, Once more from travel to repose And strive to sooth its lov'd-one's woes. This is one of the many beautiful fables of the East, and the Halcyon and Nautilus are a pair of lovers that may almost vie with the Nightingale and the Rose.— “How merrily,” young Reumon said, As on the painted vessel sped, “Doth my brave bark its pathway trace “Along the ruffled Ocean's face!— “A thing more beautiful and swift “Than ever the dark billows saw “Across their swelling bosoms drift, “Obedient to the steersman's law. “My dark-eyed Love! 'twas made by Sprites “That move thro' Ocean, as the lights “Of Heaven on high—'twas made to sweep “With my dear Beauty o'er the Deep, “And bear her from an unblest soil, “Where all was tumult and turmoil, “Unto a bright and matchless Isle, “That far across the waves doth smile, “Array'd in loveliness divine— “Fair Love! that Island home is mine:— “I bade the Spirits who do dwell “Within the Mermaid's coral cell “Bedeck it all in loveliest guise, “To charm my Laura's radiant eyes;— “And they have made it almost vie “With the rare glory of the sky, “And fill'd it all with forms as fair “As those that revel in the air, “Or skim the sea, or haunt the shade, “Of leafy grove and forest glade: “But beauteous as those forms may be, “Not one may e'er compare with thee, “And the blest Isle will own a Queen “Unrivall'd as its matchless scene!” “How blissfully,” the Maiden said, As swiftly on the light bark sped, “Will pass the feather-footed hours “In that fair Island's lovely bowers! “How passing sweet 'twill be to list “To all the sounds which there exist, “In whisp'ring streams, that wind about “O'er flow'ry vale and gentle hill; “In strains, from every grove sent out “By birds that love the woodland still, “And, most of all, in song and tune “Of Spirits, floating 'neath the moon! “How sweet to wander, side by side, “Along the banks of each bright tide; “On verdant fields, that give to view “Many a flow'rs imperial hue; “To rest by moolight, in the grove, “In slumbers, fill'd with dreams of love! “Now hie thee on, my nimble bark! “I long that Island fair to mark;— “Too fast to such a beauteous scene “Thou canst not bear its happy Queen.” And fast—and fast, with motion deft, The bounding waves the vessel cleft; And whilst it kept its rapid path, They wail'd around it, as in wrath That thing so slight, from coast to coast, Should dare to brave their mingled host. It flew, as it had wings and life To bear it thro' the billows strife,— And dash'd away along their foam, As anxious to its bourn to come. It flies—it flies: the Lovers reach The happy Island's tranquil beach And quit the vessel, which again Glides swiftly o'er the weltering main:— It bounds away, all life and light, With speed of unimagin'd might; The Lovers watch its rapid course Along the murmuring waters hoarse, Until it gains its native spray, And, in the distance, fades away. Then hied they from the glorious strand And quickly pac'd its glitt'ring sand, O'er which were scatter'd shell and gem, Each fit to grace a diadem; (A diadem work'd out to press A brow of regal loveliness;) Or, sparkling ever, hang to deck The rarest maiden's blushing neck.— They hasten'd on, and soon were met By forms of heavenly mould;— Forms that the eye may ne'er forget If once it doth behold: Their limbs were light; their eyes were blue; Their cheeks were all of rosy hue,— And veins of azure, small and bright, Career'd along their bosoms white— Rich as the sky, when partly seen Thro' clouds of pure and snow-like sheen. And those who gaz'd upon their tresses, Responding to the winds' caresses, Might deem they had received the kiss Of Crathis and of Sybaris, Fountains mentioned by Ovid (Met. xv. l. 315-16.) as possessing the wondrous property of adorning vulgar hair with the refined colors of amber and gold—thus: “Crathis, et huic Sybaris nostris conterminus arvis, “Electro similes faciunt, auroque capillos.” And, wash'd in either fountain fair, Had gain'd their matchless colors there. And sweetest songs they merrily sung To greet their Monarch aud Mistress young; And round them joyfully danc'd along, In concord with their heavenly song:— “Oh! welcome, fair Maiden of distant earth, “To beautiful scenes of passion and mirth: “Oh! welcome, dear Maiden—approach and mark “The land thou hast reach'd in thy glittering bark.” And lightly on the Maiden mov'd Beside the step of him she lov'd: Thro' scenes of beauty they pursued Their flowery way, and soon ascended A mount, that in the Island stood And almost with the bright clouds blended; They paus'd upon its middle steep And turn'd to gaze on all around,— And scarce the Maid her sense could keep For rapture at the sight she found: For, far beneath, three vallies green In all their verdant pride were seen, Upon whose breasts sweet flow'rs arose, As bright as e'er the Morning view'd Beneath her glorious eye unclose And smile upon the sun-beams rude, That love to quit their native sky On beds so beautiful to lie: And odorous shrubs their incense shed Upon the earth, and thro' the air Such sweet perfumes unceasing spread, One might have grown inebriate there From scenting fragrancy so rare.— Thro' each green valley's bright abode Streamlets, for ever murmuring, flow'd, Transparent as the light that lies In wicked Beauty's dangerous eyes; And o'er them hung each graceful tree That loves beside the wave to be, In morning dew all wet and dipp'd, Which slowly from their branches dripp'd;— And ere the drops the earth could print They drank the passing sun-beam's tint,— So that the gazing eye, deceiv'd, Might, for a moment, have believ'd The glittering boughs did doubtless throw Bright amber on the ground below: And, midst the herbage and the bloom Of flowers, that mingled their perfume, Wide branches forth did proudly shoot Far distant from their native root, All loaded with delicious fruit, Of every die and every shape That rich Pomona's children wear:— Some scarcely from the leaves escape, But slumber in their beauty there; Whilst others boldly darken forth And dare t' assert their matchless worth, And look upon the flowers, that smile Beneath them, on the green below, As if they thought to prove the while How deeplier beautiful their glow: In other lands, in other climes Fruits ripen at their several times; But here together all display'd Their hues, in gay confusion laid, And yellow, purple, green and red All—all at once shone overhead. Beyond the vales fair hills appear'd And gently up their foreheads rear'd:— Some yellow all with flowery dress; Others of darker loveliness;— And some were crown'd by meeting trees, From whose thick boughs the wild birds sung Songs, whose melodious flow might please The ear that heard their tuneful tongue Much as the sound that waters give, In falling ever, those who live Where, on the scarcely-breathing Day, The sun pours down his burning ray, And parches all things with his beam, Save the bright bosom of the stream. Then round the mount young Laura past:— At every step new glories greeted Her sparkling eyes, and loud and fast Her lips sweet words of joy repeated.— And last she view'd a sloping plain Sweep from the mountain to the main, Whereon were sporting deer and fawn, And timid sheep and young gazelle, With every beast that loves to dwell On flowery mead and grassy lawn. Beyond the green and fertile wold In majesty the Ocean roll'd, By rocks that almost seem'd to pry Into the wide, cerulean sky, As fiery passion dares to trace The beauty of a virgin's face:— The waves roll'd on and mix'd their sound With that which floated far around, Harmoniously, from vale and hill— Given out by glad bird's tuneful bill;— And wave and bird their voice combine With all the minstrelsy divine Of heavenly song and heavenly lyre, Resounding with their rarest fire, To praise the Spirit's glorious child And her he lov'd—the Maiden wild. Such the blest Isle. And now the night Comes in her starry garment bright, And Reumon and his lov'd-one hie Within their Island-home to lie, And fall from passion's tumults deep Into a long and quiet sleep. 'Twas in the centre of a grove, Fit for the silent hours of love— Its floor was laid with marble, stain'd With colors in fantastic mode, And carpets on the ground remain'd That might have grac'd a God's abode— All soft as down, and each gave way At every passing footstep gay: With radiant hues the ceilings glow'd, And many a matchless figure show'd;— Each trac'd by some impassion'd hand, That could creation's power command, And unto painted beauty give The magic of the forms that live,— And draw the Ocean, Earth and Sky Divine as in reality. By every glittering casement's side, Rich tapestry hung flowing down, And, doubling all the chambers pride, Along the walls such Mirrors shone As Beauty loves (nor doth she sin) To see herself reflected in. The Maiden strayed thro' room and hall, And look'd delighted upon all:— Then, full of pleasure, she reclin'd On Reumon's breast her glowing cheek; Recall'd each beauteous scene to mind And strove her boundless joy to speak: Whilst he replied to every word That her enchanting lips preferr'd In tones divine—and, as she spoke, With kisses oft her accents broke: He lov'd the varied charms to view That rapture o'er her features threw, And every moment nearer still He clasp'd her to his heart, until, By slumber's gentle power opprest, She sunk within his arms to rest! Then sounds arose:—the Sprites that kept Their revels, as the Maiden slept, And danc'd and sang, thro' all the grove, The dance and song that Spirits love, Tun'd all their lyres to gentle numbers To sooth the happy Maiden's slumbers, And as they notes harmonious play'd, These the gay words their sweet lips said: “Maiden of Earth! when the Nightingales tell Tales of their sorrow in valley and dell, We do love to mingle our music light With the songs they pour on the ear of night; But never before did we sing our tune To Maiden reposing beneath the moon. “Maiden of Earth! when the sportive winds sigh, Sweetly beneath the pale stars of the sky, We love to waken our songs divine, And all their notes with the breeze combine; But never before have we warbled a tune To slumbering Maiden beneath the bright moon. “And when streams in the ray of the moonlight are bounding, And their music sublime is right merrily sounding, We love to play on our minstrel-string And in reply to the waters sing; But never till now have fram'd a tune For Maiden asleep beneath the moon. “Fair Queen of our Island! 'tis fit for thee In regions of pleasure like this to be:— The young myrtle never could prosper yet Wherever the climate is cold and wet, And maidens should live in a land like this To flourish in beauty, to revel in bliss. “We have play'd to the sorrowful Nightingale's song; We have warbled reply To the winds of the sky, And have sung to the stream as it bounded along;— But never before have we fram'd a tune For Maiden reposing beneath the moon.” The music dies—the song is sung— Their lyres away the Sprites have flung;— They hasten from the grove's retreat, And tread the earth with airy feet; Hie to their beds of gentle rest, Recumbent on the Island's breast, And soon each joyful Sprite reposes In beauty on a couch of roses. And, my wild Muse! 'tis time for thee To cease thy careless minstrelsy, And hie to rest with Sprite and maid, In slumber on their Island laid.— Away to sleep,—or else thy song May haply seem too wild and long; For Critic stern doth little heed Things that the bounds of truth exceed, And names of Sprites the beauteous theme At best a vain and idle dream, Bred in the frenzied Poet's thought And madly into music wrought— The music of the tuneful verse Which his impassion'd lips rehearse.— Then furl thy wing—nor evermore Of Spirits be thy artless lore; Or, if such themes be still thy choice, Sing with a less erratic voice! Come, my wild Muse! from sky and land, Wherein thou rov'st with magic wand, That gives all things a blissful guise Which meet thine ever wandering eyes— Bless but a moment more my numbers, And then resume thy fleeting slumbers, Soon to awake, renew'd again, And ponder on a loftier strain! Oh! fast as sound the moments fly When loving lips and eyes are nigh,— And hours and years mov'd swiftly on Within the Island's sunny clime, Where joy and love for ever shone Upon the tearless course of time:— And the young Maid, as Spirits fair, Still reign'd the peerless Beauty there;— And he—the Ocean-Spirit's Child— For ever on his lov'd-one smil'd, And gave unto her wondering view Things that till then no mortal knew;— The mysteries of Sea and Heaven, The language of their Dwellers bright— All to her growing sense were given; And songs by day and dreams by night,— By Spirits sung, by Sprites inspir'd,— For ever her young fancy fir'd. Theirs was a love that could not die— All free from Sorrow's tear, or sigh; A feeling passionate, whose power Alloy might never prove,— But made their happy Island-bower A Paradise of Love! And, all alone, thro' grove and shade Of foliage by each woodland glade, They wander'd oft, when vanish'd Day Left Night to her sublime array Of stars, that love her brow to press— Each one a world of loveliness! And, frequent, when the moonlight pale Smil'd radiance on the fragrant vale, They lay in bliss divine and deep— Lull'd by the songs of Sprites to sleep. If such their love—oh! wonder not That all beside they soon forgot; Felt not a wish to change, or roam, And never left their Island-home. And would ye fain question where now is the dwelling Of those of whose deeds my wild lay hath been telling? Of the dead Maid that reign'd in the palace of Ocean? Of the Spirit that lov'd—the proud Lord of the Deep? Of the beautiful Sprites that have paid her devotion, And oft have been seen in my strange song to weep? If Reumon yet live—if his Laura yet smile, All loveliness still, in their favorite Isle? And where on the breast of the limitless Sea That Island of beauty and verdure may be?— —Oh! seek not wild Fancy's sweet dreams to dispel, Nor strive the gay thoughts of the Poet to quell:— From fable to truth, oh! how dull the transition— —'Tis foolish to search for the things of a vision! THE END.</field>
